76561198006756264,1,Rebel Fury,"Indie, Strategy",Recommended,"This feeling when you maneuver for 40 minutes only for the AI to break and freeze your game forever. Also, the scenarios are weird because its always most beneficial to snipe one enemy unit and then not attack like ever. Victory points for killing enemy units coupled with potential infinite movement and 80% of every map being defensive terrain create extremely bizzare game flow.",6.8 hrs on record,N/A

76561198006756264,2,Burden of Command™,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"Bullets do not kill in this game. Enemies do not rout, retreat, can't be killed, wounded, broken, rendered combat ineffective in any other way than by forcing them to surrender. If you catch an enemy infantry squad on the open ground, in a machine gun crossfire, fire on them with multiple infantry squads, pound them with artillery, tough luck. If you do not plan to leave your trenches and run into them onto the open field to accept their surrender, don't even bother. But that only works one way. I moved my one guy from the rocks through the rocks into the rocks and tank sniped me from the quadruple maximum garand range distance through the trees in one shot. I thought to myself,. wow, that was extremely unlucky. I moved another officer same way - another tank sniped me. I moved last two officers same way - they died also. That was all in one turn. That's 4 shots from the other side of the map, through the forest into a single man moving from hard cover through hard cover into hard cover. There is something seriously wrong with the combat mechanics. Edit. Honorable mention for hilariously bad tutorial. I haven't seen anything even half as bad in my life. It's so bad that it's good, worth checking out.",20.0 hrs on record,N/A

Last parts of the game however were a total let down and the ending was straight up bad.

76561198006756264,2,Pentiment,"Adventure, Casual",Recommended,"Yes it's beautiful and unique and it starts off great, but: - murder mystery without resolution, because they thought it doesn't matter for you who did it, after you just spend 15 hours trying to figure out who did it I could stop at this point beacause it's a dealbreaker for me, but let's go on: - horrible pacing, story just drops at one point and never picks up the tempo again - too many fillers. I understand it helps the worldbuilding but after 3 hours of gossip with millers wife I don't need another 3 hours gossip with fisherman's wife or whatever - mind-numbingly boring 3 Act - at some point it changes its tone from authentic and historical to ""let's preach about modern day politics"" -  illusion of choice but it's really linear - no proper save system - everything you do is on time-constraint which some may don't like (I don't mind)",13.2 hrs on record,N/A

I think Arthur Knights's Tale was GOTY and I loved every second of it. But playing as these undead ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jokers is seriously lame. Why can't you give us real, alive and cool-looking roman soldiers? Instead you gave us those silly skeletor-meme guys in goofy masks. It looks like there was a contest of who can came up with the most idiotic mask and the winners made it to the team. To add insult to injury we are suppose to fight and kill our own heroes from the previous game, you know, the ones we actually like and care about. I feel that alignment choice is also very poorly done in this one as we can basically only choose between two flavours of evil. Still, regardless of what you decide, the result is ""whatever"" as it doesn't change anything. Next time instead of trying to come up with a really creative idea just give us normal roman soldiers doing normal roman soldier things and I promise you it's gonna be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ banger.

I don't know what's the point. - My God the balance is so bad it's unbelievable. Just take 10 x Dreadnought for your roster and steamroll everything. Primaris Jumppack units are also crazy OP.

Playing this game is like being stalked by a creep who tries to impress you with unfunny jokes. When you don't laugh creep follows up with a lengthy explanation of a joke, why it was funny and what was the punchline, anxiously waiting for you to finally ""get it"". If you even smirk at the joke the situation will become even worse as the creep will now follow you everywhere telling you the same joke over and over and over again, thinking it's ever funnier, though it really wasn't in the first place. Judging by the amount of awkward sexual references and rejection jokes in the positive review section big part of the fan base are those exact guys from the example above. Humor goes like this: Haha meme reference, haha butts and farts, haha sex, haha penis, haha hurting and killing people cause we no snowflakes bro, haha feces and defecation,  haha popculture reference, haha religion stupid cause we woke bro, haha creepy sexual reference, haha old internet joke, haha someone farted so I guess butts again, or maybe defecation, I don't know, I'm not really good at this.

It was often to vague for me and lacking clear context combined with a lack of rules in a certain situations made me confused. For example: my army is ""pinned"" but what does that even mean. In a context of a whole army (armies) I have no idea. They are not surrounded, flanked, shelled, attacked, just ""pinned"". So like, what's going on there? How it translates to the rules I have no idea either. How am I suppose to make a decision If I can't neither imagine nor understand what is going on there. What I learned is that ""pinned"" simply means ""unable to conduct offensive operations"" and it makes perfect sense but I had to figure it out. I started as soviets and was like: ""Oh, so it works this way, restart"" ""Oh, so it works that way, restart"" ""Oh, so it makes this and that, restart"" It reminds me a bit of Operational Art of War which you need to ""figure out"" cause 3/4 crucial mechanics are hidden but on a smaller scale. It all makes sense but you need to look for it. It's a really decent game if someone wishes to learn by trying. Most fun for me was Winter Counteroffensive as Soviets when I was just checking which army is able to attack not if the attacking makes any sense since I was conducting Baltic to Black Sea wide charge. Pushing reinforcements straight from the rail transport immediately into assault was crazy and resulted in horrific losses for both sides but yielded minor victory result.

Instead of difficulty they introduced annoying save system and braindead permadeath companions. So either you play lone wolf and skip 2/3 of the story or you need to manually leave your companions behind a rock far away before EVERY SINGLE FIGHT. Also if you wanna save (and you want to save frequently because-> companions) you need to go back to quest hub/transition zone/ship. So you gonna run back and forth through empty cleared areas a lot. A LOT. Also no fast travel, because ""difficulty"". Of course fights are laughably easy, no difficulty introduced here. You can beat every enemy Benny Hill style running around the rock or house, or just shooting them since they lose aggro after like 20 meters or 5 seconds (unless->companions). Also fatigue/hunger/thirst system is introduced in a worst possible way. You need to keep all 3 above 90% at all times or suffer hefty penalties. While with food and drink it's easy (yet extremely annoying) with fatigue is not such an easy case. Because ""difficulty"" you can sleep only on your ship. You can't sleep in an inn, hotel, camp, heck you can't even sleep IN YOUR OWN HOME. Only ship.

If things go sideways you may try to get your pilots out of the dodge instead of pressing on the mission. - due to open structure you can lose multiple missions and still win the air superiority campaign Additional cons: - unbalanced missions (just don't play troop-carriers escort) - game crashed for me twice (once at the end of perfect no losses ambush) and when I rebooted the game it counted as defeat (!) - luck may be a deciding factor sometimes, if dices decide that you lose - you lose All in all  8+/10",17.3 hrs on record																					(2.6 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198006756264,34,Unity of Command II,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"Game is great with one crippling issue: supply. Supply is a 0-1 method based on % chance. If for example you have 50% supply there is 50% chance you receive full supply and 50% you receive no supply. In practice it looks like this: I have two infantry units sitting in Palermo and on the field adjacent. Enemy is wiped out and all the terrain around is mine. Friendly supply point is on the other side of the island and it's pretty far away so even though I have uninterrupted road from here to there my supply is 50%. First unit is winning coin flip 3 times and is sitting fully supplied all the time on the field while their neighbours sitting in PALERMO lose coin flip 3 times and mass-die of starvation or I don't know what. I remind you that all this time there are no enemy units present so I suppose it's not the issue of running low on ammo and medicines. Also they are standing in ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Palermo and although I realise it's not the same city as today I believe you shouldn't mass-die of starvation there during a period of a week in the middle of a summer. Also, tutorial and manual are sh/t. Press fire to fire, move if you want to move, that's it, you're ready, go! Except you are not. You don't known jack sh/t about many crucial mechanics.

Have all the wood from the forest for all I care. What story does it tell? At the end the guy with the most cash in the bank wins. How anti-climatic is that?

I need to research an upgrade to move additional guys. They all have legs as far as I can see, why can't they move? It is understandable in a game like flashpoint campaigns where there is a symulation of electronic warfare and communication strain on multiple military formations under a time pressure - it makes sense there and adds to the experience.

76561198006756264,47,Tales from Candlekeep: Tomb of Annihilation,"Adventure, RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"Tales from Candlekeep: Tomb of Annihilation feels like a very good digital port of a very bad boardgame. From a technical point of view it's top notch: pretty, with well-made user interface, nice animations, music, proper tutorial, no technical problems etc etc. But from a game mechanics point of view it has some serious issues. My main beef is the encounter system. If you remember Warhammer Quest, event system there looked like this: After finishing player turn you rolled d6 and on 1 event happened. Here event happens every time after each character (character!) turn. Since you're controlling 4 characters you've got 4 events happening every turn. It's beyond ridiculous since they take like half of the play time, constantly stunning, poisoning, damaging, debuffing and annoying the hell out of you. It feels like being attacked by a horde of invisible enemies all the time. Normal enemies are easy to deal with, but the events are your main problem. Since you've got really small possibilty to influence them, every game feels like a race that you try to finish before all of you heroes die from random damage effects. I understand that it is anti-stalling mechanics but it is done terribly wrong. My another beef is from game being really really slow. Considering I'm a guy with over 200 hours in Flashpoint: Campaigns I'm not exactly a fan of action games and my tolerance to slow is probably bigger than most of you. But this game takes slow one step too far. Why do I have to watch ""Enemies turn"" pop up and skip animation every time, even when there are no enemies on the table (80%of the time)? Why do I have to watch animations for the events bombarding me constantly for 1 damage, 1 damage, 2 damage and pressing space after each and every one of them? I know that this game is licensed and I even played this Ravenloft-boardgame old counterpart (wasn't stellar either) but this one is just plain bad. Wanna good D&D boardgame go and play Lords of the Waterdeep. Another thing: balance. I realise that I can't judge that after 1-2 hours, and I need to make it to the endgame to see things from a proper perspective, but early game looks like this: You've got amazing paladin with best base stats, best passives and best abilities kicking butts left and right and 3 other sad excuses for adventurers just filling the spots and dying randomly from time to time. Last thing, my personal beef. Names. Ranger Artur is ok, but others... Dragonbait? Who made this up? Birdsong? really? Why is my khajit-looking Bard named Birdsong? What do you have to do to come up with such a stupid name? I know it's D&D and I know it doesn't bother anyone else, but still. Dragonbait. Dragonbait. His parents must have really hated him to name him Dragonbait. Ok, nevermind, I digress...

76561197963260222,1,A Way Out,"Action, Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"Having played both ""It Takes Two"" and ""Split Fiction"" before trying out ""A Way Out"" it gives some interesting perspective on the game. You can definitely tell it is rougher around the edges than the future titles, but that also gives it a lot of charm. There are some intense sequences and it feels a lot more grounded and the consequences real. Some parts are much weaker than others and some of the combat sequences are pretty meh. Plus, the ""dialogue at the same time"" with one being super muted felt like an odd decision. However, all that being said, the more realistic and relationship building between the characters was much more impactful. Having more free form interactions and actual meaningful decisions that changed how you approach things was appreciated instead of the more ""on rails"" gameplay of the others. The highs were very high and the build up to the ending was very satisfying. Overall, it was weaker in terms of gameplay and overall design than the other titles, but the story and characters had a lot more depth and feelings, so to me it balanced out to be similar to ""Split Fiction"" overall. 7.25/10",7.3 hrs on record,N/A
76561197963260222,1,TUNIC,"Action, Adventure, RPG",Recommended,"Great game that has a lot of ""a-ha that was here the whole time"" moments that I absolutely love and wish more games focused on. Overall, it was an awesome experience, but a few issues really held it back from being truly amazing. *Very minor and vague spoilers below* First, the camera angles were frustrating at times. Targeting creates this weird vignette that makes it harder to see and some puzzles are hard to piece together because of the camera. While it might be intentional, it is also annoying. Second, losing consumables and not being able to get them back in-between respawns is incredibly punishing. You could use a lot of consumables when fighting a boss, die, and then have no consumables making the boss fight even more challenging or requiring you to go around getting consumables again. To me it is a very odd decision and one that just felt like you should never use consumables, which goes against their whole point of existing in the first place. Third, some of the puzzles are very difficult or silly. Like having to piece together stuff throughout the game and retread the same ground to find the pieces was tiresome. And one or two puzzles requiring you to take notes and/or use an image editor outside the game to put it together is meh. Thankfully, these are few and far between (I only counted 3-4 with this issue) and can easily be looked up online. But having them at all took me out of the immersive experience, especially while playing on a Steam Deck, and would have been improved if you could ""combine"" things in-game. Fourth, there's a decent amount of backtracking through stuff towards the end. It isn't too bad, but just something to note that can be boring treading through areas and things you've already done a few times. Fifth, missing one little page can dramatically hamper you in terms of progressing. Again, not the biggest issue, but felt odd to be so far off track until I stumbled on something I had missed earlier. Sixth, combat is okay, but a bit repetitive. I wish there were more combos or things to do at times. You get a stick earlier in the game and then never use it again. Thought it was a missed opportunity to have different core weapons or other attack abilities. Plus, swapping weapons or items in-combat is a weird dexterity speed check. Would have been better to pause the game to allow swapping or a button to instant swap to a different setup. Overall, the game is very good but the few issues above really pulled it down instead of being as stellar as Outer Wilds was. 7.25/10",20.7 hrs on record,N/A
76561197963260222,1,Split Fiction,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"Like its predecessor, It Takes Two, Split Fiction is all about collaboration (or ""col-lab-or-a-tion"" in the words of the famed Dr. Hakim). For me, it is a small step up over It Takes Two in a few aspects, but not as many as I would have liked.  While most of the game is very ""on rails"" and linear, there are some interesting twists here and there that make up for it. The puzzles are also somewhat straight forward and a bit simpler than It Takes Two, but work overall. Switching between sci-fi and fantasy worlds is fun and refreshing, especially the levels where you have multiple forms and can swap between your powers. While the sci-fi worlds do feel a bit samey at times, there is enough variety to keep you engaged. The game will often harken back to other classic games which is a cute shout out at times. There are two big problems for me that hold it back from being incredible. First, and more minor, are the powers given to Mio and Zoe. Mio has a lot of cool powers that are flexible and used in lots of situations, while Zoe almost always has ""magnetism"" based powers (outside of one place where it is somewhat the reverse). While not horrible, it does get a bit repetitive to have ""yet another power that moves this to that"" or ""pushes this to there"" or whatever. Just a nitpick, but would have liked to see more variety in the powers between the two characters. Second, and the more major, is the story. It is super tropey, cliche, boring, and one dimensional. The bad guy, Rader, is a bad guy without any redeeming qualities, interesting character development arcs, or any narrative twists. He is just evil through and through. His whole motivation on ""stealing ideas/creativity"" is pretty silly too, especially when Mio and Zoe don't seem to be very original. Ideas are largely a dime a dozen and it is more about execution, which neither Mio or Zoe can pull off, let alone someone as banal as Rader. Mio and Zoe as characters are fun, but their ""I'm serious and you're silly"" into them both (somewhat) swapping roles and then finally warming up is very played out. The idea that one person can be only for sci-fi and another for fantasy is pretty ridiculous too. Basically, the whole premise on why they dislike each other at the start is extremely artificial feeling. At least It Takes Two had some fun moments and lightheartedness with Dr. Hakim, but that is completely missing here outside of a few minor gags. Overall, the game is amusing and something to check out if you really liked It Takes Two and want more. I'd say it is also good to support developers, like Hazelight, who are against scummy monetization models. So, if you can look past the narrative and the on-rails, largely straight forward gameplay, it is an overall enjoyable experience. 7.25/10",17.1 hrs on record,N/A
76561197963260222,1,LOK Digital,"Casual, Indie",Recommended,"Incredible game with so much hidden complexity behind a seemingly simple covering. Like a lot of ""discovery / exploration"" games there are rules and other things hidden that you won't understand until you get farther into the game. Try the demo or download the free PDF of the game if you want to try it out. The negatives? A little heavy on ""order of operations,"" but the hints help reduce that significantly. I love puzzle games that rely on clever ""out of box thinking"" instead of ""do these in a certain order to win,"" which this has, but it also has the out of box stuff in spades. Sadly, the hints don't appear on overworld levels or daily levels (I guess for leaderboard reasons? But that's a bit silly since someone could cheat and redo them to get high scores anyway). There are some discoveries and unlocks that require you to replay things and ""hunt"" for them, which is a little tiresome retreading ground (guides online can help you find them at least, but I wish they maybe gave more hints at where they were in-game). Plus, there's a lot of hidden levels that require some meta thinking to unlock, which are a bit obtuse. I also wish you could access settings without going back to the main menu and that they had a ""Darker Mode"" as the Dark Mode is still a tiny bit too bright for late, late night gaming.

76561197963260222,1,Blue Prince,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy",Recommended,"Tentative review. While I've finished the basic game, there's a lot more left to do and explore. I'll try to remain as spoiler free (outside of the basic premise and starting intro of the game) as possible in the review. Blue Prince is a fascinating game both from an artistic and game design point of view. It smashes together rogue-lite elements and environmental puzzle solving into a unique blend that both hits and misses at key points. Artistically, the game looks beautiful and there's a deep lore and an interesting story at the heart of the game. While the story is a bit straightforward-ish at times, there's enough there to tell a charming and somewhat moving tale, with more to learn and figure out if you want to delve deeper into the world. Puzzle-wise, the puzzles are (usually) neat and clever. Some make you go ""OOOH!"" and change how you think about the game, similar to Outer Wilds, but some other puzzles are just obtuse and/or poorly designed and/or repetitive. Generally, the puzzles for the base default ending are not too bad, but too many things mislead you and/or hint at more complex things which are only used after finding the 46th room. The lack of an in-game notebook or tracking system is hugely problematic to me, and just having SOMETHING (like you do get in Outer Wilds) would help significantly. Many people complain about the sheer RNG of the game, which I agree is a bit high, but it is largely mitigated once you figure out how the systems work. There are some times where it can be VERY frustrating and an entire day can be ""lost"" (with little to no learning or progress) due to a single bad roll or tiny misstep. The most annoying part is when you solve and/or figure out a puzzle, only to not be able to actually complete it or progress around it due to not getting the correct room, which is heavily exacerbated when the puzzle requires multiple rooms (sometimes even adjacent-ish), and you just can't get the combo when you need it. This also happens in reverse, when you get a cool combo but don't actually realize it until after the fact because you didn't have enough information to actually solve it at the time. Honestly, they really should be more forgiving and make things easier to explore and achieve. It feels a bit too tight, even with permanent upgrades that eventually help, and could easily be 20% more generous with resources and still be a great but challenging game. Either way, despite all the bad things, the good elements far outweighs them and it is a game that has a lot to offer for those who don't mind some level of frustration and random elements. Just go into the game with those things in mind and you'll feel a lot better about your experience. 7.5/10 (would be an 8 with some QoL improvements and better ways to mitigate the RNG outliers, like maybe even just seeing 4 rooms at a time once you have more rooms in the drafting pool or something) EDIT: After playing more, I can definitely see some of the repetition and grinding issues, especially in post-game content. I got stuck on a puzzle and decided to look it up -- it was a bonkers rabbit hole of a solution. *MINOR VAGUE SPOILERS* They require solving multiple higher level puzzles with specific room formations over multiple days, comboing it with other bonuses (stars / shrine / chess), multiple upgraded tools, translating an alien language, and studying an alien history ... to even manage to figure that out, let alone to get those combinations, would take over a hundred hours. Even knowing the general solution, I could see it taking 20+ hours of repeated runs just to get the correct combos. So, while the game is still good overall, and something I am happy to have played, the sheer difficulty in the highest and most complex puzzles is just way too much for 99%+ of the players out there and thus I'm reducing my rating down to a 7/10 and with QoL improvements it would probably go up to a 7.5. EDIT: Having nearly 100% the game at this point, I largely still agree with my initial impression. RNG can be mitigated mid-to-late game with a few other features, which makes it less problematic, but the fact you get them so far in and have to suffer through earlier issues is very frustrating. The rogue-lite elements of building up currencies feels a bit off putting at times because you'll have to grind at some points unless you get very lucky. Plus, some of the mid-to-late game puzzles are so silly and require weird logical leaps. There's very little feedback on puzzles and you could be working on them for hours or days and be completely off, never knowing it. To me the game is still a 7/10 for the initial gameplay and drops down to like a 6.5 in the mid-to-late game since the puzzles just get bonkers and there's no real hints. Hopefully, with some QoL adjustments it will improve the game to around a 7-7.25, but without a lot more changes to things (which I highly doubt would happen), I don't see it improving significantly. Still something to pick up if you love environmental puzzle games and don't mind the RNG and rogue-lite elements, but a much less accessible and enjoyable game than something like Outer Wilds, which to me did an incredible job in a semi-similar space.",82.4 hrs on record																					(79.4 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197963260222,1,Vanguard Exiles,"Strategy, Early Access",Recommended,"Still rough around the edges, but it brings an interesting twist to the auto-battler genre. Each player is a ""smash up"" of two different factions with a subset of the faction's units. This allows for some interesting combos and unexpected surprises when playing as it is extremely rare to play against the same exact combo ever again. However, there are a few sore spots at the moment that I can only imagine will be improved as time goes on. I wish the rules were explained a bit more -- it can be difficult to parse why units take a certain path or do certain things. The game definitely needs a fleshed out tutorial and maybe a Wiki / encyclopedia to show all the different factions, units, spells, and other things. Having a timer for re-rolling squads makes sense in a competitive environment, but is also a bit long and punishing for someone who wants to see and try out a certain fun combo they've been dreaming about casually. Some stats are a bit frustrating and binary, like high dodge or armored units, and there are times where an early location win can snowball someone ahead over and over (bonus gold into a lucky unit that you then can win the bonus gold again and so on). Lucking into initiative can be huge sometimes, especially early in the game, and can be the difference from a close fight to a huge mop up. Finally, a lot of the deployment -- which is completely blind where people will deploy units -- can be hard to plan around. The can lead to some feel bad moment where it feels like a lot of it was a coin toss. Overall, these problems aren't too bad and I suspect they will be ironed out as the game is developed. The ""Statistics"" option that shows all the possibilities with tons of simulated games is really neat and appreciated, but does highlight some of the issues. Richard teased on BGG that they might look into using the ""Statistics"" analytics in gameplay, which sounds very exciting. Either way, I just wish there was just a tad bit more agency and less swingy aspects to it, but besides that I can see it has some solid potential, especially as more factions and locations are added.",2.4 hrs on record,N/A
76561197963260222,1,Run the Rings Demo,Strategy,Recommended,"Has some neat ideas, but is really suffering from a few major issues. First, you'll sometimes fight enemies at different stages than you. Like I fought someone who was at round 8 when I was at round 7. Second, each system doesn't act simultaneously, and you have to wait for other systems to process before one starts, spends the time cooling down, and then activates. The means getting one or two powerful systems is much better than lots of little systems that might take time to activate. Third, the game doesn't explain stuff to you UNTIL you buy it. At that point you might have just made a huge mistake and you don't know. Fourth, the speed up function doesn't speed it up much. Against some ships with a lot of shields and defensive attributes battles are very long and you have to wait until ""overheating"" kills you/them (basically like the sandstorm in The Bazaar). I'm sure there are more things I'm missing, but it is still VERY rough. Interested to see where it goes but at the same time it needs quite a bit of polish before it is there and does something to differentiate itself from the countless other similar asynchronous auto-battlers out there.",0.5 hrs on record,N/A

Some levels are very punishing and the rules are often finicky or obscure. Other puzzles have hidden walls or special objects you can only find by looking at the slightly different pixels. You will probably be backtracking quite a bit or going to islands that you can't even progress on. The star locking system works at times, but then feels arbitrary at other times. I'll give it a tentative thumbs up, but it has a lot of rough edges.

76561197963260222,1,Nodebuster,"Casual, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"Nodebuster is interesting and there's a bit more skill expression there than I originally thought. However, a huge amount of that is undermined by the fact you can't remove upgrades. Without the ability to remove upgrades it takes out clever strategies. Like being very tiny in size, to avoid taking damage, and focusing on boss damage upgrades. Or removing ranged upgrades to more easily idle farm, instead of killing enemies at a distance where you can't claim their resources while idling. The pacing is a bit off at times -- little too slow at the start and the end game feels a bit of a slog getting the final currency, but overall it isn't a bad experience. It is definitely ""on the fence"" for me and only barely pushed over due to the low cost. Pretty short and has no real replayability. The game doesn't do a lot to innovate and only adds a tiny bit of agency to an idler game format, that often works against itself with the upgrades, so overall the game is fairly average. 5/10",46.5 hrs on record,N/A
76561197963260222,1,Sid Meier's Civilization VII,"Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"Quick review with first impressions and oof... tl;dr: Meta progression doesn't belong in a Civ game. The rest can be fixed, but I feel the meta progression is way too baked in that it won't be easily fixed or removed. As much as it pains me to say, Civilization 7 is very rough. The idea is great and I love splitting the game into eras where things change and gameplay resets somewhat, but how they handled it leaves a bit to be desired. It is such a hard cut off between eras and feels horrible if you miss a HUGE upgrade by a single turn. Like imagine missing a Wonder by a turn, except times 10 the frustration. Especially if you're trying to unlock a specific civilization to play in the next era and again miss it by a tiny, tiny amount. Feels odd to not be able to change your leader too. The game also is lacking a lot of UI things and abilities to easily quell unhappy towns. There seems to be no way to remove towns or make them stop bleeding if they are angry because you went over some threshold by just a tiny bit. You can have just a tiny amount of unhappiness in a town and completely lose it because there's no way to get them happiness, despite having a TON of gold you should be able to throw at them to build stuff or give them things. These things can largely be polished and improved, but what really annoys me is the whole ""meta"" game around leveling up leaders and doing things for XP and other unlocks? It is mindboggling they added this to a Civilization game. Like ... what? You're locking options behind playing the game a lot? Really? The whole point of Civilization was a freeform exploration into cool things, not playing over and over to unlock new options that you can't get access to at the start. And it is spread throughout the game and has links to 2K Games with your own 2K Games account that logs in and links to your Steam too? Why? The game screams like some 2K Games exec wanted to cram live service things into it and have Twitch drops and other event unlocks for a game that shouldn't care about that stuff. Ugh... just no.

76561197963260222,2,Satisfactory,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"This review will compare the game to Factorio (not Space Age, as I'm currently playing that while writing this review and might update this afterwards), since they are very intertwined as capstone automation games. Both are incredible and something to check out. If you're new to the genre, check out Shapez first and if you like that but want more, go for either. Minor spoilers for both, but not a ton. tl;dr: Needs more fauna and personal upgrades, otherwise a near masterpiece. 9/10 Full Review: While not as good as Factorio -- it is damn near close. Satisfactory has a lot of great aspects to it for an automation game and surpasses Factorio in a few key areas while lagging behind in others. The exploration and first person perspective adds a neat layer that you don't get in Factorio. It focuses more on power consumption and connecting remote locations with exclusive resources and less on logistics of organization and optimization paths. The efficiency / optimization in Satisfactory is significantly easier to manage due to underclocking/overclocking things directly and seeing exact input and production values (which makes it much easier to optimize around and something I think Factorio could really use). Because the world is in 3D and you can (largely) use no-clipping for planning connections, it becomes more about having enough power and then just feeding long lines to other locations (direct connections, vehicles, trains, etc). While Factorio often is about how to smash together the pieces to get the correct combos feeding into the automation factories, Satisfactory has so much space that you can just crisscross things to match up as needed. While the first person perspective offers a lot of awesome things (scale, immersion, jumpscares), it overall hinders the experience from a planning perspective. Being able to see all the connections and lines becomes much more difficult, and you have to keep a lot more of it in your head, which isn't really fun or meaningful gameplay. The overall perspective is a negative factor for a game like this, even outside of the motion sickness which a lot of people experience while playing it. Research and technology progression is different, and overall slightly weaker. Researching is less piece-meal and grouped into multiple discoveries at once. This often leads to explosions of new buildings which can be overwhelming to deal with, instead of a more gradual refactoring and improvement cycle. Additionally, research is gated by large blockers revolving around building the space elevator. This results in large down times as the space elevator pieces build, which while it does give time for exploring, feels a bit too artificial in how much it constricts. The lack of being able to build/combine components to make more advanced components in your ""backpack"" also results in some odd moments where you're stuck and have to return to another factory to just get the ingredients. Factorio lets you combine things as you move, which is technically inefficient, but at least solves a lot of issues about forgetting tiny things when building new bases. Where Satisfactory shines above Factorio is in exploration. After setting up your production and research tracks you have some downtime for things to complete, instead of just sitting around optimizing (or going around killing alien bases to reduce incoming attacks), you're actively scavenging the world for resources and artifacts. These artifacts allow for interesting new discoveries and ways to supercharge your base. The ability for ""alternative recipes"" is brilliant and can completely change how one person approaches Satisfactory to another -- one thing Factorio could REALLY use. The other artifacts are technology blockers for digitizing components (giving access to things from afar) and output multipliers, both of which are cool, handy, and useful. Additionally, the verticality aspect of Satisfactory allows for a lot of fun movement modes and exploration options solved by construction or technology. It does feel a bit limited on what could be possible, but still something unique that isn't seen in Factorio. While there are weapons and other military options in Satisfactory, they are pretty generic and pale in comparison to those in Factorio. The fauna is pretty straightforward and easy to defeat, even with the most basic weapons, which is very disappointing. There is no base defending and combat usually boils down to strafing / jumping while shooting. Had Satisfactory doubled the number of fauna and weapon / movement / personal upgrade options this might be a different story, but it was the one area that really felt lacking. Fighting the same rhino-boar-like enemy for the millionth time was just meh. Give more diversity in the enemies and strategic planning on different upgrades to overcome them! I understand that isn't the focus, but why not lean into the biggest unique factor that would set it apart from Factorio? Oh well. Plus, radiation and poison clouds feels overly punishing and there aren't great options beside stacking filters or avoiding/removing the source. Great for limiting players and creating interesting barriers at the start, but just becomes annoying in the end game. There is a lot more hand-holding on Satisfactory, which is nice so you can get into the heart of the game faster, but also leads to less discovery and needed improvement. Factorio says, ""get this end goal, figure out how to do it,"" while Satisfactory says, ""these are the steps needed to reach the end goal."" Neither a good or negative thing, it is just something to consider when comparing the two and if you like something that is more obvious or something that takes longer to puzzle out. Either way, Satisfactory is incredibly well designed, fun, and rewarding. Highly, highly recommended. 9/10 EDIT: Minor typos.",132.0 hrs on record,N/A
76561197963260222,2,Castlevania Advance Collection,Action,Recommended,"Going to break down my review for each game and then give an overview of the collection as a whole. --- Castlevania: Circle of the Moon The overall feel and gameplay is solid. The core gimmick is the DSS ""card"" system where you take 1 of 10 action cards and 1 of 10 element cards and combine them to get unique abilities / effects. It is a bit much and could have been streamlined down to maybe 6-7 and 6-7, as a lot of the combinations are silly and/or completely useless or outshone by other choices. Still, it is fun and allows for exploration and some interesting discoveries for such an old game. The level design is average and while you do have to backtrack a bit it isn't that bad and overall it is fairly straightforward, especially if you use a color coded map guide. The main problems of the game are the sheer difficulty and punishing nature of some enemies / bosses, with attacks that are nearly impossible to dodge or deal with. Luckily, that is largely mitigated with the collection's ""rewind"" ability, but it is still frustrating at times. An even bigger problem is the weird drop rate and somewhat walling of advancement behind leveling up or farming. You can technically beat the game at low level, no items, with no cards, but realistically you need to farm some enemies to get XP / drops / cards to have an OK time progressing. It really locks you behind farming enemies for drops or XP for a while, which was probably done to pad out gameplay length, but in modern designs just feel like a slog at times. The ""rewind"" system does help where you can kill an enemy, check for a drop, and instantly rewind to just before you kill it to ""re-roll"" the drops over and over (just make an attack in between to advance the in-game RNG counter). Still clunky and time consuming, but makes it at least manageable. Finally, some enemy designs are just boring and/or frustrating. The end boss (Dracula, surprise surprise) is very boring and straight forward, while some bosses like Zombie Dragon have just weird attack patterns and a ton of health that makes it a slog. All things said the game isn't bad, but isn't great, and definitely shows its age. Rating: 6/10 --- Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance For nearly every step forward over Circle of the Moon, it takes a step sideways and a step back. The feel is very ""floaty"" and a bit unresponsive. Instead of being able to see the enemy name, the damage you're dealing, and other basic UI things, you have to unlock them -- which isn't a big deal as you can get them in the first 30-45 minutes, but it just seems odd. The core gimmick in this game is the ""sub weapon + elemental spell book combo system"" which feels worse than the DSS system from Circle of the Moon. While the DSS system was bloated and this a bit more streamlined, it relies on certain sub-weapons and means you can't easily change or adapt, you have to backtrack and find the sub-weapon to activate the ability you actually want. Ugh. Difficulty wise the game is much more forgiving and feels more fair (sometimes too much so), although bosses are somewhat even more bland at times which makes the whole thing a lateral move, or even slightly back, instead of something better. The biggest problems though, outside of the floaty feel and more ""zoomed in"" perspective (both which gives less overall control), is the level design which is pretty horrendous. You're backtracking often with little idea on where to go and sections are blocked off until you reach certain new powers without much rhyme or reason. It is VERY frustrating to have to backtrack huge amounts and check every place you haven't explored yet on the off chance you can now explore it with your new power up (as it isn't labeled what you need and where even if you're seen it)... which often isn't the correct one so you're just backtracking even more. The premise of ""two maps that are the same but different"" is neat, but it is just really poorly executed here. Really, really bad level design choices all around. Rating: 5/10 --- Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow Circle of the Moon walked and Harmony of Dissonance crawled so Aria of Sorrow could run. While not as good as the DS titles to follow (Dawn of Sorrow / Portrait of Ruin / Order of Ecclesia), this is a solid game with a lot of great stuff held back by a few really odd and bad decisions. Controls are much smoother and tighter, and the camera view is zoomed out enough so you can actually appreciate the levels while dodging enemies and more. General movement is much more reigned in -- there's only a back dash and you only get a good movement speed ability ultra late into the game -- which feels more limiting. The concept of ""every enemy has a soul you can absorb to get a special power"" is super neat, but most abilities are meh, and the drop rate for some are INCREDIBLY low. While not a big deal for someone casually playing, it is very frustrating when trying to 100% the soul collection. Even with the ""Soul Eater'' ring (which increases the odds of getting souls at the cost of 300k gold, or like an hour or so of farming gold), it only makes it barely acceptable. If the default drop rate matched having a Soul Eater ring and the Soul Eater ring gave even more it would be okay, but the sheer amount of farming one has to do significantly hurts the game. However, you can use the “Rewind” system here to reduce the farming, but even then it is a bit brutal (again, remember to attack the air in between resets to advance the RNG counter). Weapons are better and generally more varied, but some are just leagues above others, which makes a lot of the decisions not really meaningful. Finally, while the general flow and difficulty is good, some bosses are fun and others just boring. The variance between enemy design leaves a sour taste. A good experience, but overall not the best it could be, but the best for this collection. Rating: 7/10 --- Castlevania: Dracula X Ew. This review is getting long enough so just skip this game. It has some good music at times and the backflip is cool, I guess? Rating: 2/10 --- Castlevania Advance Collection The collection itself is decent and the improvements / additions are generally very positive, but the individual games have ups and downs. The ability to ""rewind"" time dramatically helps with antiquated difficulty, level progression, and drop rates. Without that option the whole collection would have been significantly worse. It also allows for saving anywhere, an in-game encyclopedia of drops / monsters / other things, and some other tiny add-ons. Definitely a good improvement that helps smooth over the rough edges. Overall, the collection is okay and is a nice trip down memory lane, but just be warned on what you're getting for better or worse. Recommend it, but probably wait until it is on sale, unless you really want to experience nostalgia head on. Rating: 6.75/10 P.S. One can only hope they come out with a ""Castlevania DS Collection"" where they really learned from the GBA games and made some decent titles.",53.0 hrs on record,N/A
76561197963260222,2,Buckshot Roulette,"Action, Indie, Simulation",Recommended,"Outside of the questionable theme and over glorification of drugs (that also don't really match up to how they would actually affect you), the gameplay is pretty straightforward and bland. Essentially, you're playing ""Russian Roulette"" with modifiers to tweak rules. However, before you even get ""items"" that modify things you have to play a normal game... it took me like 5 tries of just guessing over and over to get past the intro to the actual gameplay simply because I got unlucky (2/3 chance to succeed but failed over and over). After that the game adds a few more elements that lets you learn information, modifies variables (damage, life, turns), steal power ups, and other ""take that"" things. Power ups are randomly distributed and the rounds change the rules ever so slightly, but it is still extremely high variance. And even with all those ""choices"" it ultimately still comes down to a very small and straightforward decision tree that isn't very meaningful or interesting. Yes, the game is pretty cheap and it isn't trying to be something that is infinitely playable, but it got boring to me before even an hour was up. Just feels like it is lacking just a bit more in terms of meaningful decisions outside of flipping a weighted coin.

The game is overall fine, but has some core issues that keep it from being good to great. The music is great, the animations and effects are charming, and the gnorps themselves are cute. The overall incremental nature of the game works and is largely fine, but has way too many ""design traps"" that are suboptimal and/or literally bad choices that can ruin a run. It feels horrible to play for a few hours in an incremental game to realize you made one little mistake by upgrading something you can't easily undo that completely stops you from progressing further. Wish they took another pass at all the skills / choices and made them more balanced and/or interesting and/or possible to undo without fully resetting a run. There also seems to be only a few viable paths to victory in the late game (better than only 1 path, but not enough for decisions to feel meaningful). Plus, the way the Prestige track works there isn't a lot of granularity so you often miss getting a new prestige point just barely which can be frustrating. That's a more complex issue to solve (something like creating more prestige points and having certain prestige upgrades cost more or something to make it less binary), but might help with the feel bad moments that come from not reaching a new prestige threshold and some prestige choices being left behind quickly since they all cost the same to activate. There are nuggets of goodness here, and the overall concept works, but sadly I can't recommend it simply due to the frustration around the sheer number of ""trap choices"" that exist without any easy way to fix / undo them. 5/10",22.7 hrs on record,N/A

76561197963260222,2,Can of Wormholes,Indie,Recommended,"Incredibly good, clever, and well thought out Sokoban-style puzzle game. Has a lot of ""A-ha!"" moments despite the very simple rules set behind the interactions. It is challenging, but not overly so, especially with the clever ""Gain Insight"" system that shows a simpler version of the puzzle, but (usually) doesn't give enough away for you to instantly solve the main puzzle without some more thought. The game is just the right amount of length too -- maybe even slightly too long overall, but has varying degrees of ""end game"" success to help mitigate that somewhat. *** Very, very minor spoilers below *** However, despite all the amazing things about this puzzle game, there are a few places that could be improved and some negatives overall. The UI and visibility of the game is pretty bare bones without much in terms of accessibility options. I had to crank up the brightness on my Steam Deck to make out what was happening a few times. Also, the ""top down"" view option isn't very good, especially when you need to deal with layer positioning; maybe if they had a way to easily tilt / rotate the camera or something it would help. Plus, maybe some accessibility options to show ""how/where something rotates"" despite a quick animation that bounces back when the rotation fails. There are hints in-game for the ""meta"" game part, but no way to easily access them after you've encountered them. I had to take screenshots and refer back to it that way -- wish there was some in-game way to look them up after discovering them for the first time. Also, some of the images feel like red herrings and don't make much sense in terms of what you do (only part of the story, I guess). Speaking of the meta puzzles, they are pretty good but I kinda wish there were more of them, especially the wires stuff. Also, a few things are hinted at (like the color of the wormholes) but then never actually explored or explained. Felt like a missed opportunity for more ""meta"" stuff. The story is also a bit... out there? I guess it exists though so better than nothing, maybe? Besides the above issues, I really wish the game had a puzzle editor/creator. There are a few mechanisms that are only used once or twice, but feel like they have a lot of potential being the seed for some new and interesting puzzles types. While the overall game length is pretty great, I would like to see a little bit more in terms of ""complicated end game puzzles using all the tools you've learned before"" as there are only a few of them. Makes sense there aren't many since they are kinda filler and the game tries to avoid that, but would be nice to have some more (maybe bonus content separate from the main game and meta progression at a later date?). All things considered this is one of the best Sokoban and puzzle games in general out there. Right now it is like an 8.5/10, but with some of the above fixes and additions I could see it rising to a 9/10 and falling just below some other all time greats like ""Recursed"" and ""Baba Is You"" and very few others.

The game does start to falter at higher difficulties (Purple Stake and higher) where it is extremely luck dependent on progressing and no matter how well you play you'll lose without getting some powerful combos. Not a huge deal, but just can be frustrating and off-putting at times. There are also some UI/UX design improvements and fiddly min/max strategies that could be made better or more streamlined (like being able to go back in some menus before new information is revealed or more explanation / control on played card order / order of scored Jokers).

76561197963260222,2,TEKKEN 8,Action,Recommended,"EDIT: I'm giving the game a ""NO"" on recommending it now simply because they have predatory FOMO battle pass additions that were never mentioned before. The whole bait-and-switch behind their monetization has left a really sour taste in the community and this practice should not be encouraged. Selling cosmetics was fine, but tying it to time limited events that require grinding to unlock content is not okay. Thumbs way down now. Original review follows below: Great version of the Tekken franchise. Has a large list of characters, feels really smooth, new systems that help players comeback / do cool combos, has options to make the game easier for people, practice modes, and lots of other things. The story is pretty meh overall and very ""anime""-like, which took me out of it a bit. Plus, in the story you're playing as Jin like 90% of the time instead of jumping around and learning about other characters and what they are doing. I think MK9 did it much better in terms of a playable fighting game story. Should have really focused on multiple characters and had more things than just the same few fights over and over (and the wonky fighting masses of 3D enemies). Either way, this is a great continuation of the Tekken franchise.

Figuring out the languages through context clues and using logic is neat and the UI/UX behind it is very clever and smooth. It does get a little repetitive and I wish some of the languages were a bit more unique at times, but overall it is a huge selling point of the game. The story is a bit nonsensical at times, but not too much to completely pull you out of it. However, the game does have some weird ""stealth / reaction time"" sequences that really take away from the core experience. Not sure why they were included outside of one or two, which are used to really heighten the emotional response to some parts. Thankfully, they are usually pretty short and not too intrusive, but something to be aware of. Finally, there are a few puzzles that are just confusing and/or poorly done. Specifically (without being spoilery), the ""number / math"" ones,  the ""wait in real time"" nonsense, the ""glitched"" ones, and the ""memory / pay attention to tiny details on aesthetics"" type things.

76561197963260222,3,MARVEL SNAP,"Casual, Strategy, Free To Play",Recommended,"EDIT 3: Even worse monetization policies lately with no refunds and blatant misleading and false advertising (saying X variant won't come back for 6 months and bringing it back before that) and they refuse refunds. Besides the monetization the game is great with Conquest (and some upcoming modes that have been hinted at). Just wish they were really less predatory on FOMO and stingy on giving out new cards. EDIT 2: Still negative because of the horrible monetization they have. But they have fixed a lot of bugs and Conquest is the best thing to the game. If only they made things more accessible and friendly to players... instead it was a side move to have ""Spotlight Caches"" instead of just letting people get stuff more regularly. EDIT: After another 100+ hours I have to give it a negative review. The recent changes and lack of listening to player feedback (especially around the weird Collector's Token breakpoints) has soured me. It is still a bit fun and I play here and there. But the overall game has become a bit bloated and much more ""pay-to-win"" or at least ""pay to get the best meta counters out there."" Mixed positive/negative review. Overall positive though. My reference is from probably 50+ hours on the game now on mobile having gotten to Gold/Platinum multiple times just from casually playing here and there while completing Missions. The game is very solid and reminiscent of the ""Air, Land & Sea"" card game (which itself took inspiration from Battle Line). It is quick and tight and there's a lot of meaningful decisions and cool things going on, especially with the Snap wagering mechanism. The characters make sense logically and the unlock system is neat and different from opening packs. But there are a few key, and major, negatives to consider. Note: This doesn't include any of the current PC bugs which are numerous but I assume will be fixed by the time it leaves Early Access. This is more an analysis of the gameplay and monetization. First negative: The paywall hits hard. After Pool 1 (around level 222) the progression basically slows down to a standstill without paying. You go from unlocking 2-4 cards a day to like 1 card a day. After that it becomes even slower when you start getting into the end of Pool 2 and Pool 3. It isn't the end of the world as you'll still have a lot of options to make different decks, but it does feel a bit jarring compared to recent F2P games like Legends of Runeterra, which are overly generous in comparison. The battle pass is pretty fair overall, but a bit expensive at $10 or $15 for a boost. Feels like it should have been $5 and $10 instead for what you get. Second negative: While the gameplay is really good, it can be overly tight and restrictive at times. Some moves are painfully obvious and thus are sometimes not very interesting. I kinda wish the game started you wtih 2 energy instead of 1, an extra card, and/or you had a larger hand limit. There are random locations which can really do fun stuff, but often the game will come down to a coinflip on the last turn based on a Rock, Paper, Scissors choice. Just wish there was more room for skill expression. Third negative: High variance. No matter how skilled you are at the game you can lose just due to luck of the draw and from locations that counter you. That can be very frustrating at times, but thankfully the Snap mechanism means you can just Retreat and only lose 1-2 rank instead of 4 to 8 rank. Not a huge deal but something to consider. Fourth negative: Lack of information. There are a lot of deck types and it is hard to ""scout"" to know what the opponent might be playing and thus knowing what to play around. If there was more information given then I feel like you could make more meaningful choices and strategize. This also comes into play since you're doing 1 off matches instead of a ""best of 3"" or whatever -- which I think would improve the game a lot. I'll sometimes rematch against the same person and it is much more enjoyable playing them a second time knowing what they are going for and how to counter it. Fifth negative: Few gameplay modes. Right now there's basically only a single type of gameplay mode which is 1v1 ranked. There's no play to try out new builds, challenge specific players, have special gameplay rules, or anything else. I assume they will add these in the future, and possibly even PvE or 2v2 or whatever. So not a huge negative but something to consider. While all this sounds bad, the game is still super solid and slick and fun. Just be mindful of the negatives when playing. To me it is overall a very refreshing F2P title and I just wish they made it have a bit more skill expression and be a bit more generous on new cards (but keep cosmetics at the current cost).

Instead, the puzzles are more about optimization and efficiency. While that is enjoyable to a lot of people, I find it to be a bit tedious in that you will redo the puzzle over and over to get solutions with slightly fewer steps.

76561197963260222,3,Cultist Simulator,"Indie, RPG, Simulation",Recommended,"Neat idea and fairly unique in terms of execution, but has a lot of problems. The game is a mashup of a lot of elements but it boils down to a semi-worker placement card game revolving around a lot of trial-and-error and hoping to get lucky with the correct combination of things appearing. This idea works in ""Stacklands"" because it is quicker, more focused, and not as punishing. However, here it is very painful as the ""try different combinations to get things to work"" takes time, effort, energy, and more all while other things are ticking on in the background. It is very easy to spiral out of control with not having money or enough resources to solve problems that pop up. Not a deal breaker itself, but there are 2 key issues that result in it being a mess. First, there are no save slots -- it is a rogue-like where you will be spending hours building up and ""rolling the dice"" on finding things that can all end abruptly if you mess up or get unlucky. With multiple save slots you could actually experiment and figure stuff out without dooming a multiple hour game from a single tiny mistake. And second -- the game often boils down to rolling for specific items over and over hoping to get the correct type of magic to progress. There are 9-ish paths of magic and getting pieces of them is largely random. You meander around collecting fragments of lore to complete a mission and only 1/9th of them are applicable (yes some build / help get others but how would you know without more trial-and-error?). That means you're juggling dozens of things just to hope you roll the dice on finding the right combination you're looking for. Even using a Wiki to look up the stuff is difficult because there is just so much thrown together in convoluted ways. This game might have been a borderline recommend if they simple had save states and the ability to undo things... but make some mistakes and you're back to 3+ hours of grinding to get back to where you were all because you did the wrong thing without knowing any better.

76561197963260222,4,A Monster's Expedition,"Adventure, Casual, Indie, Strategy",Recommended,"Probably Draknek's best puzzle game. It is very relaxing and peaceful with a simple premise. It is a Sokoban-style game where you are pushing trees down and rolling them around -- kinda like Stephen's Sausage Roll but more forgiving. There are very few ""rules"" and even fewer ""exceptions"" (if any), but it has a surprising amount of depth. Most puzzles are very simple and you can breeze along at a pretty quick pace. This is both good and bad. The difficulty in puzzles varies pretty wildly with some being completely brainless to others being pretty complex. This leads to the primary negative aspect of the game (outside the lack of variety), where the paths you take are so free form that you might quickly stumble onto a more complex island and be stumped and frustrated for a while. There is a ""map"" but it is difficult to navigate and very large, which means you can often get lost and/or not easily find more puzzles outside of just looking for unexplored areas. I wish there was a bit more structure and a curve to the puzzle difficulties overall. Maybe even having the islands sectioned into a level manager to make difficulty and navigating more straight forward, quick, and transparent. Outside of ""finishing"" the base game there are some additional puzzles that let you explore more islands and find more human artifacts. That is where it becomes slightly more interesting and fun. And then the final challenge is combining islands together to solve even more difficult puzzles and find ""snowman friends"" -- some of which are incredibly difficult (as of writing this review I'm about 70%+ done all the friends). Thankfully, there's enough here to keep you coming back if you enjoy the basic premise, but sadly there isn't a demo anymore (and won't be according to the dev) to see if you like the basics. Try it out and if you still enjoy it towards 2 hours in then you'll probably be pleased with the game as it is just more of the same. The ""story"" and ""comedy"" is very hit-or-miss, with more towards the ""miss"" unless you're a big fan of dad jokes and/or silly observational humor (like ""Strange Planet"" by Nathan Pyle). But it is overall cute and doesn't distract from the gameplay much. With the addition of the hint system it definitely makes it more enjoyable and casual, which is great for this style of game. I enjoyed it more than Stephen's Sausage Roll, but far less than Recursed and some other Sokoban-style games like Baba Is You / Patrick's Paradox. If you really like puzzle games with a simple premise that is repeated over and over with very tiny twists here and there then I'd recommend it.

There's a lot to like, but some really clunky and out of place things. For a game about solving a mystery, there are some odd design decisions around ""action"" sections.

Spooky, linear, frustrating, anticlimactic. 7/10 (Only because of the specific option in the menu) *** MILD SPOILER REVIEW BELOW: Imagine a single planet from the base game, but two to three as many puzzles within it, that are largely linear puzzles, and there are anglerfish all over the place that are twice as responsive and twice as fast. I feel like there was a lot of potential here that was squandered. Took some of the worst parts of the base game and made it about half of the expansion. *** MAJOR SPOILER REVIEW BELOW: First, there is no text to read so every story element is told in a series of image snapshots. That's fine, but I wish you could have translated and understood the mentality of these people more. Why do I care about these people outside of, ""ooo another place to explore""? You don't care. Second, there's a lot of backtracking and doing the same things over after you learn slightly new things. This was fine in the base game since a lot of the backtracking was on other planets, which opened other puzzles and interesting things. Here it is the same basic location over and over. Third, the ""stealth gameplay"" flies in the face of the ""explore freely"" mentality of the base game. Having some stealth sections would be fine, but they are so overdone, especially towards the end of the game when going to the archives. The ability to make enemies slower in the options is crucial, if it wasn't for that this game would be like a 6/10. Anglerfish were annoying in the base game, but manageable. Why take that concept and make it so prevalent? Fourth, some of the story elements don't make sense. Why does blowing out candles in the simulation turn off lights in the real world (and why are there no hints for that directly)? Why did the Owl-Elk spend all this time moving these panels with the lock combinations, record moving them, only to then burn them? Why not just burn them and be done with it instead of going through the effort of hiding them? Why lock someone up in this complicated vault with multiple keys and puzzles? Why do the Owl-Elk attack you if they see you instead of trying to communicate? They are an intelligent species so why are they so hostile for no reason? Why are you trying to open someone in a locked vault in the first place? Doesn't make sense. So much of the story just feels poorly executed. Fifth, the anticlimactic ending. You finally get to The Prisoner and get their story, but why do you care? What's the point of freeing them and communicating? There's no real interest except they were (somewhat) wrongly imprisoned. Whoopie. The device stopping the Eye has decayed already. And even after finishing the expansion nothing changes except they show up at the end of the base game. Feels just like the whole Quantum Moon thing with Solanum, which I felt was the biggest negative of the base game. You do all this stuff to unlock and figure out the Quantum Moon and it turns out to not even matter. Same thing here. This expansion could have been a lot better, and could still be better, if a few things were tweaked. I'd reduce the number of enemies and make them slower by default, and even slower with the option on. I'd make the puzzles less linear and spread a few more clues around that hints at some things. There are a few hints already in this vein, like the sleeping, but there could be more, along the lines of the simulation and dying to ignore bells. And the blowing of candles impacting lights in the real world. I'd have multiple solutions to some puzzles, so you don't have to kill yourself to get past the bells in the third lock, and don't have to glitch to open the second lock. Keep those as options, but give other ways to find the codes. I'd have some final answer that the Prisoner gives you to disable the lock on the Eye or something making this expansion tie into the base game more outside of, ""oh that's why the Eye signal disappeared to the Nomai."" And finally, I'd give some upgrade to your translator so you can read a few of their writings, and add more writings outside of just ""look here"" or ""avoid this,"" which seems to be the only things they wrote anyway. Give me a reason to care about the Prisoner and these people! There's literally no motivation outside of, ""it is here so why not fool around with it."" It would be fine if the base game was changed to accommodate the expansion, but instead it felt like they wanted it to exist completely separate from everything else, which made it a much weaker game overall. Still something to play (with the option to weaken enemies on), but a far cry from the brilliance of the original. 7/10",0.0 hrs on record,N/A
76561197963260222,5,Cookie Clicker,"Casual, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"Classic and one of the first idler incremental games. Really should cost $4.99 + the cost of a new mouse. Anyway, while the game is fine and overall fun, there are a few big issues that keep me from giving it a thumbs up at this time. First, there are some bugs with the port. Sometimes the game doesn't save properly and/or sync with the cloud saving. Minor issues where you can just copy your save code and import it and such. But the bigger issue is that there's no way to play other games on Steam while it is running. Normally, when it runs in a browser, it is in the background and isn't a big deal. But the way Steam works means you can't have 2 games playing at the same time with them both being online at the same time. I could go ""offline"" on one computer running it but then I might as well just use the browser, plus that requires 2 computers. I wish they would enable a way for the game to be closed and still function at 100% ... they would need to rework how the ""idle while game is closed"" bonuses for other things work, but it would free up the ability to play other Steam games while also ""playing"" Cookie Clicker. If they can fix these two issues the game would definitely be a thumbs up for the nostalgia, history, and overall decent idle gameplay. P.S. I hope some other idlers/incrementals come to Steam... maybe in some group bundle including: Candy Box 1/2, A Dark Room, Crank, Universal Paperclips, The Prestige Tree, Antimatter Dimensions, and others. EDIT: The main issue I was having was due to cloud saving sync issues with Steam. The issue still remains if you have Cookie Clicker running on one computer and want to play a game on the other. No easy way to solve this since it is on Steam's hands, but it would be nice if Cookie Clicker had an ""offline idle"" with 100% values instead of requiring upgrades. Steam is a different platform than browsers and as such should be designed slightly differently.","3,003.9 hrs on record																					(72.9 hrs at review time)",N/A

No conflict or fighting and just about setting up a network of trades for places that create and take a variety of goods.

The campaign is nice and offers some cool tweaks -- I wish there was more like that and maybe more diversity in the game-to-game interactions. It often seems like re-rolling to get a good tech combo offering and good starting spot, which is meh. Also, the achievements are all over the place from being super easy to incredibly impossible and luck-based. Wish they weren't so heavily determined by luck at times, but oh well. So, while I do recommend the game, be aware that it can get same-y and that all the content isn't there yet. The campaign is only up to Act 1 and they are working on the rest.

What I like about digital solitaire is that I can enable ""always possible to win if played perfectly"" mode, ensuring that I can replay and discover how I could have improved my performance. However, there is no option for that here. There are random situations where you can literally lose on the first turn due to a bad deal -- like having a hand of all low cards and every pile being top decked with high ones. Sure, you can just ""start over"" (although oddly there isn't a restart option, you have to exit to the menu and then go back into a game), but it just takes the feeling of an interesting puzzle to figure out and turns it into an exercise of futility. Also, the scoring system encourages pushing your luck, but it scales so dramatically and becomes an ""all or nothing"" situation that is largely based on nothing but sheer randomness. Same with the random scouting rolls... you could have 5 out of 6 piles available to scout and simply roll poorly resulting in losing a card for nothing. The art is great and music decent, but that's about it. The game was obviously mobile first and the port leaves a lot to be desired. There are times when it isn't clear that you need to ""click and drag"" to move things in menus. And the lack of a ""Restart"" button seems odd. But all the cosmetic and UI/UX stuff aside, the gameplay simply falls flat. I wish there was more depth and interesting things going on (see the solitaire card game ""Card Crawl"" as a game that at least somewhat works or the slightly better ""Card Thief""). The sheer randomness and variance in ""Brave Hand"" is just too much and often feels like an exercise in futility where you're simply at the mercy of luck and nothing else. Something where ""if you beat a card by exactly 1 higher you 'scout' the next card"" or something going on to add more decision making would be an easy addition to improve it a lot. Or removing the dice rolling for scouting and just letting you pick two decks (or only roll available spots). Or doing something in the design to simply reduce the sheer lack of control. Ugh. Games are largely about meaningful and interesting decisions, and that's where this game falls flat. There are few decisions and ways to increase your skill. The other modes offer a slight twist on things, but even they are such tiny variations as to not really fix the core issues with the game itself. ""Boost Mode"" feels odd because you're spending in-game currency (that you usually get by playing the default way) to get bonuses? And you could just get a bad deal and instantly lose, thus having to pay money again to play the mode. Huh, who thought that was a good design decision? Also, by just waiting you can get Gold coins? Why? If you enjoy the card ""game"" (more like activity) of ""War"" then you might also like this... but for almost everyone else I'd say skip it. 2/10",2.3 hrs on record																					(2.2 hrs at review time),N/A

I enjoyed the demo and put like 5 hours into it, but it just continues like the demo with more and more progression. The difficulty comes from requiring you to farm up good bonuses and other permanent stat buffs. So much of the game is RNG based, and while I enjoy some of the ""push your luck"" aspects of the game, it ultimately just bogs down in a slog of ""do a run, get resources to upgrade town unless you get super lucky on drops and then hope your luck continues to defeat the boss."" Rinse and repeat over and over. There are some things you can do to mitigate the luck and increase player agency, but it definitely isn't much. The game often feels like it is just on auto-pilot. Like an idler game that you can't actually idle... Try the demo. If you like the demo and want more of the same then go for it.

In fixing some bugs (Lighthouse stacking), it just made the game unapproachable to all but the most hardcore players. Also, the skill tree is really weird. Some skills are super essential while others are a joke. Just feels like a horribly balanced game that needs a huge overhaul to really nail down the systems that exist. The concept is there, but the execution is just painfully slow. Maybe if everything was sped up by 20-30% it might be fun, but as it stands unless you have 50+ hours to invest to a single game it just isn't worth it. Go for Stardew Valley or Factorio instead.

Second, while some levels are incredibly well designed and good, a few were tweaked were made after release and have weird gaps and/or feel out of place. This is only a level or two though, so again not a big deal. Third, there are two levels that don't fit the mold and are just long and frustrating.

I really, really wanted to like this game, but there's so many little things that are just beyond frustrating about it. They really wanted to stick to a lot of the old school tropes, but at the cost of so much more. The primary problem in the game is the sheer number of ""instant death"" spots. Instead of actual challenging gameplay like Cuphead, they instead rely on huge knockback times, lack of control, and other gimmicks that instantly kill you. The platforming itself feels clunky and generally unreliable, and that just makes things extremely frustrating when trying to dodge or platform on things that a single miss will instant kill you. They rely on instant kills because they seemingly can't create good and challenging gameplay without. They give a huge number of life bonuses, but they are generally meaningless as the most dangerous spots instantly kill you regardless of your health. I like hard games, I really do, I've 100% Cuphead on Expert. But this isn't hard, it is just frustratingly unfair at times. That combined with the lack of accessibility options for special powers (they are always mapped to up + button, instead of a single button option). Just makes the game incredibly drawn out and requires lots of retreading the same ground at times due to instant death and backtracking just to get gold. Ugh.

76561197963260222,9,Baba Is You,Indie,Recommended,"One of the best puzzle games I've ever played. Extremely fun and interesting. While there are a few dud levels (like maybe 5-10), considering the game has ~225 levels that is to be expected. Since almost everything about the game is perfect, there isn't much to say except the negatives. The biggest flaw of the game is two fold: 1.) The timing of some interactions is confusing and some of the ""puzzle gimmicks"" are a bit obtuse such that you'd never really get it without trial and error. This is not that major of an issue though. 2.) The bigger issue is the structuring and difficulty of the levels. They jump all over the place and are seemingly organized by a few keywords, thematic ties, and gimmicks. However, that will sometimes have you trying to complete levels that you don't have enough background knowledge gained from earlier puzzles to solve. This can be extremely frustrating when another level teaches you a certain mechanism that might be required for other levels. Without a true level structure you can be ill prepared for other levels simply by not doing them in the ""proper"" order. Besides those issues, the game is pretty much flawless. Once it gets a map editor and a few polishes it will be one of the best puzzle games of all time. Solid 9/10. EDIT: With the update of the Level Editor and more levels, the only negative is the organizing and difficulty of some levels.

Oh, and the game is awesome if you enjoy things like Harvest Moon and other light farming simulator + RPG element type games. Highly recommended. EDIT: Now having 100% the game with version 1.6, I think I can give an updated review. The game is still great and a classic that set the standard for cozy farming games with quaint little towns and charming people. Very smooth and has decent levels of progression and unlocks with new stories, characters, and aspects to explore throughout your time playing it. The negatives, which are few and far between, are about some fiddliness in luck / grinding around getting 100% (like having to farm for dinosaurs by chance or trying to find that very last museum item). I also wish there were more high tier / late game options that enabled more automation. There are huts and auto-petters, but it feels like there's a lot more room to add stuff there. Finally, I wish there were more interesting and branching narrative options. The characters are fun and different, but generally feel pretty linear in their story. It seems like your choices don't really matter (outside of community center vs Joja) -- regardless of what you do you can win people back by basically just bribing them enough with gifts. It would also be nice if there was more diversity and representation with the characters, as it feels very one dimensional at times.

The game is overly repetitive, mindless, and devoid of actual interesting decisions. The randomness is a huge issue, with some dice rolls determining the game. Since there is only a single die roll there's no averaging of numbers. There is also a huge amount of variance within the game, where someone can get a single lucky roll and win the game. My first game I just randomly picked everything and won by double everyone else's score (400+ stars vs their 200). In that game if the opponent rolled a single pip higher they would have won. That type of pure chaos is super common in matches. Additionally, the unlocking system screams antiquatedness. Random cards from packs that cost in-game currency that means you have to farm for hours in games... just ugh. I'm honestly not sure why this game has such high ratings.

And the biggest problem, outside of the large amount of grinding to unlock the content, is the sheer repetition of it all with huge swings due to randomness. I feel like I can make very little meaningful decisions because I don't know the distribution of the cards or what I or my opponent will get or how the card effects will happen.

And as it stands it isn't a bad game by any measure, I'd rate it as ""neutral with potential to be great."" However, outside of a few bugs, typos, and UI issues, there are some major design decisions that simply are not well thought out and really hurt the game. First, is the sheer randomness and variance in the game. Having such a small hand size and being able to only play the first 2 cards is severely crippling. I would love +1 to hand size and able to play the first three cards. Definitely feel like that would dramatically reduce the huge early game variance which can cripple a player before the game even really starts. Additionally, the way you buy new cards for your deck is super random. I would have explored a larger selection than 4 random cards within your tech limit. Something like a common pool and a private pool, maybe with the ability to remove and replace one of them each time you go to purchase. Also, when you spend a purchase point it resets the 4 cards you can add, which means you have to constantly swap after leveling up and seeing what 4 new cards are shown. Second, is the issues with versus mode. So much of the game focuses on versus and either has a weird or weaker effect or more commonly simply doesn't work in solo. Also, you can't see your opponent's hand or skill tree on your own turn. The whole versus mode, while interesting, could use a lot more polish in being balanced and interesting as a competitive engagement. Some effects are just really silly, like ineberiated (which should just have a 50% chance to place in a random spot within 1 or something instead of actually moving your mouse around). Third, is the lack of UI features. The game really could use a lot more in terms of UI information. Letting you search cards by name, keyword, or other features. Having districts be automatically outlined instead of when a building of that type of selected or hovered and showing the current / max without having to click on the zone. And removing the awful ""accidentally click and place when trying to go to the Deck Building Screen."" Fourth, the unlock cards feature is super slow. Leveling up takes forever and playing some levels over and over just to unlock one new card is silly. Wish the unlocking of cards was tied into completing levels so you wouldn't have to grind and could just focus on winning and moving on. Ultimately, the concept of the game is awesome. It really has potential and feel like it could become a classic if it was only better designed and polished.

There are a few problems with the game and there definitely needs to be more variety.

Enemies spawn from seemingly random locations, have unlimited ammo, shoot faster than you, and will shoot so wildly that you'll often dodge right into the bullet itself. You'll throw a weapon for it to disintegrate in thin air because it just clipped the edge of a wall. Or you'll die because a bullet from a far away enemy just happened to go through a window hitting you in the arm instantly killing you (your bullets through windows don't kill by the way). The level design is ultra frustrating where you'll be surrounded and just die over and over until you make the perfect play or the enemy's random bullet patterns just happen to miss you. Even when you succeed it doesn't feel like you've won. You're bombarded with random black and white screen flashes, replays are covered with ""SUPERHOT"" playing over and over, and some lame tacked on creepy pasta ""story"" about DOS and old school modems and stuff.

76561197963260222,13,Card Hunter,"RPG, Strategy, Free To Play",Recommended,"Been a long time Card Hunter fan and I'm glad it is finally coming to Steam! I probably have 1000+ hours in the game if you include the web version. tl;dr: Neat CCG game that is free-to-play and *not* pay-to-win. Extremely fun and unique game with a cool retro feel, but can be overly random, imbalanced, and frustrating at times. If you enjoy CCGs and some light RPG stuff then check it out. Obviously I'm a bit biased (both having played the game since beta and contributed published content), but I really enjoy the game and the unique things it brings to the Collectible Card Game (CCG) based format. Unlike many other CCGs, this game is absolutely NOT pay-to-win. In fact, some of the top rated players have never spent a dime. The content you purchase is really just for cosmetics, extra single player levels, or small boosts to collecting speeds (like 15% boost, which is not much at all). If you enjoy the game you should support it not so you get stuff, but so Blue Manchu can keep making new content. The game is basically a mash up of a CCG with miniatures. You use cards to control the miniatures in an arena combat. Levels will often have interesting challenges that you need to overcome, with unique cards that can drastically change how you need to play. There's a decent amount of depth in when to play what card, when to pass early, and how to manage character facing and position. There's a lot to love, a lot to learn, and a lot to master. While I do love the game, it isn't for everyone. It skins itself as an RPG, but it is much more a deck building / CCG style game. Some single player levels are extremely difficult and require you to rework your party just to overcome the challenges. Don't view it as an RPG where you get your stuff and slowly get better replacement gear -- almost every item has a use in some situation (even the super bad items are useful once you finish the game for Quests). This is both good and bad as it requires you to tailor your builds to the level, but also results in often playing a single player level just to immediately lose due to not having the ""right stuff"" equipped. Outside of that, my main complaints about the game is that it is a bit too luck based and imbalanced. There is the obvious card drawing element, but then there are dice rolls where a single one can make or break a match. Additionally, there are a few balance problems with some cards being overly dominant. If you're a hardcore CCG fan who wants to create an undefeatable build then the multiplayer game probably isn't for you. Yes, top ranked players are consistently top ranked (I was #1 for quite a while), but that doesn't mean you won't lose matches against bad players just due to sheer dumb luck. Overall, the game is very unique and fun. Since it is free there isn't much cost in trying it out. If you enjoy CCGs and have a nostalgia for old school RPG tropes then this game is perfect. I'd recommend people check it out even if you're on the fence. At most you'll lose a few hours, but at best you'll find a new love like I did.

76561197963260222,13,Bionic Commando: Rearmed,Action,Recommended,"Great remastering of an old classic. Very fun and unique to have a platformer where you can not jump at all. Many people complain about the difficulty or ""clunky"" controls. The game is supposed to have very restrictive movement. It isn't a simulation of what it would be like to be a bionic commando -- it is a game first and foremost. Overcoming the strict control and movement mechanisms is the challenge, but can be very rewarding. Watch a YouTube speed run player and you'll see how fluid it can become once you master it. Be warned though: you NEED to have a controller. The game is *literally* unbeatable on Hard+. It is impossible to beat the end boss without a controller due to being unable to remap the keyboard to split rocket launcher control from character movement. Outside of the end boss the game is extremely fun.",15.1 hrs on record																					(13.0 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197963260222,13,Crypt of the NecroDancer,"Action, Indie, RPG",Recommended,"Not only one of the best rogue-likes of all time, but one of the best games of all time. It rewards skill, tactics, and strategy with the ability to directly see your personal growth. Amazing players can in theory beat the game the first time playing simply because there is no silly grind or requirement to unlock content to be better. My only complaint is tying the story to Aria's unforgiving gameplay, specifically the fact you die if you miss a single beat. Would have much preferred that they split that feature into another character and left Aria simply as a ""one hit die with no weapon upgrade"" character. Having the full story only actually experienced by <2% of the population is a shame. Outside of that minor quibble the only thing they could do to make the game better would be adding more content -- which I can only hope they do in an expansion!",103.3 hrs on record																					(54.8 hrs at review time),N/A
