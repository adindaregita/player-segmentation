76561198885069362,2,N/A,Recommended,"This game saved my life. I am 69. My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old. When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide. After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side. Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay. After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as. Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends. I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together. Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that. Thank you.",1.3 hrs on record,N/A

76561198885069362,3,N/A,Recommended,"An actual Review As i finished the game in under 24 hours id say the game is pretty good ig. even if i don't know what the hell is going on from time to time and even when i finished the third one in the series i'd still say the game is fun as gta v. Saints row 4 has lack of attention to detail to the map and npcs compared to other open world games. saints row 4 for me is focused on the fun and over the top ♥♥♥♥ the gameplay is. the complaints i only have is the makeshift minigun, rocket, flamethrower hybrid dlc weapon and the blast power when you have it to that chain-reaction upgrade is too over-powered you can capture flashpoints and kill enemies in just one blast and the hybrid of a dlc weapon is over-powered too even when its not upgraded to the max. but then again i still like the game because it's focused on the fun for me. and the other dlc that i bought with the game for only 2 bucks are nice. especially the one with the op weapon and the anime pack (not because i'm a weeb. i thought it look nice). And my overall rating of the game as a kid is that this game is nice 7.5/10",28.1 hrs on record																					(21.9 hrs at review time),N/A

When their bones in the ocean forever will be When at last before my ghostly shipmates I stand I shed a small tear for my home upon land Though their eyes speak of depths filled with struggle and strife Their smiles below say I don't owe them my life As the souls of the dead fill the space of my eyes And my boat listed over and tried to capsize I'm this far from drowning, this far from the sea I remember the living, do they think of me? When my bones in the ocean forever will be Now that I'm staring down at the darkest abyss I'm not sure what I want but I don't think it's this As my comrades call to stand fast and forge on I make sail for the dawn 'til the darkness has gone As the souls of the dead live for'er in my mind As I live all the years that they left me behind I'll stay on the shore but still gaze at the sea I remember the fallen and they think of me For our souls in the ocean together will be I remember the fallen and they think of me For our souls in the ocean together will be","1,047.0 hrs on record																					(262.6 hrs at review time)",N/A

76561198103129312,1,N/A,Recommended,"The game shows how much Rockstar Games has grown throughout the years with their superb attempt in storytelling. This is definitely the best cowboy simulator there is! Figuratively, since the RPG elements are surprisingly addictive and should set the standard for open world games. The attention to detail is jawdropping. I love how the game puts you into different emotions like suspicion, skepticism, sadness, anticipation and satisfaction all at a great pacing. The horses are like the cars of GTA V where every physiological aspect is catered to wow the gamer. The game is labeled mature, not because of R Rated content,but its also because Rockstar Games has matured in terms of concepts discussed in-game and how it carefully treads the story of the very charismastic, dependable and gritty Arthur Morgan.

RDR2 is one of the most novel-worthy video games out there. The extreme simplicity on how they approached stories but left players with characters you will instantly remember.

76561198103129312,4,N/A,Recommended,"PLAYED ALOT OF COOP: I have played the first build of Stranded Deep. It's been 4 years. I would like to address the general clunkiness of COOP mode to this very day. I can say that if ever Raft offers the same coop mode, it would outperform stranded deep because of how simply fun and campy it looks, Stranded Deep has now approached a more realistic sense of survival like The Forest, Rust etc. ISSUES: I wish the stairs of the game can be fixed. Player needs to jump before using the stairs, which is extremely bothersome.  The items are really small and hard to navigate especially in quick craft mode. I think the UI of coop is made for PC/keyboard users with controller users not considered, i wish it has better hotkeys. The loading time for the ocean exploration is extremely slow which makes it nerve wracking because a shark might anticipate. Items like container shelf or any building should have options to be moved. Items should have names when hovered for crafting because in COOP mode its too small to distinguish. when using the compass, in third person mode, it cuts off because its way too much on the right. the HOG slowmos too. when climbing trees, i wish the character rotates becasue when you climb and reach the top, and your pointer doesn't reach the coconut for instance, you have to repeat climbing cause you cant get it. and mygosh CLAY is hard to find. omg and the FLARE it lasts for only 5 seconds wtf? Real flares dont do that. the first spear crafted is pretty damn useless honestly. Please improve on the UI and maybe a little narration can spice up the game cause its really dull, theres alot of room for a story.",6.6 hrs on record,N/A

76561198122292277,1,N/A,Recommended,"I really wanted to like this game but the way enemies work is just completely unfair. Maybe its just because I began playing on Hard for my first playthrough because I was expecting similar gameplay in a new environment with different puzzles and ♥♥♥♥, which is true for the most part, but this game just feels like such a downgrade from Resident Evil Remake in my opinion. Tl:dr and no spoilers, not bad, but not good either, Enemies are stupid unfair and environment isn't as cool, buy in a sale and don't play on Hard for your first playthrough. The purpose of a Survival Horror game is to preserve your resources, meaning you're supposed to avoid a majority of encounters with enemies. However, the monkeys just completely ignore that factor, being fast as hell and can spam attack you, which wouldn't be so bad if you were playing on a easier difficulty, but on Hard mode its borderline impossible, which was especially problematic when Ammo is much more infrequent to come by. Another issue I had was the build up to bosses or tougher enemies was basically non-existent, meaning I would lose many hours of progress simply from not knowing what was to come. Again not being an issue if resources like Ink ribbons were more common, or better yet, just add back the Storage Crate from RE1, a good indicator of a incoming boss. Thats another thing, at first I was on board with the whole ""No Magic Box"" thing but as I progress through the game, I just horded all my ♥♥♥♥ in one safe room and just ended up feeling like they might aswell have kept the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing. Ok back on Bosses, screw the Infected Bat, holy hell that thing was so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying, fast moving enemies were already an issue for me, but a FLYING one with an unusable aim mechanic? ♥♥♥♥ that. (oh did I mention a bunch of tiny bats come out and swarm the player when it gets around half health? yeah good luck aiming with that dumb ♥♥♥♥) The game isn't completely bad though, I did enjoy the Partner gameplay as it did spice things up compared to RE1, being able to use the Duo in puzzles, however I found myself just playing Billy a majority of the time since he could take alot more hits than Rebecca and exploring together was just pointless since I was trying to avoid enemies anyway, and letting Rebecca come with would just slow me down. Now on to the Maps itself, the Train is the Train, there is a reason not many people get pasted this part. The Research Facility feels tiny in comparison to the massive Mansion in RE1, with a lot of the rooms becoming completely irrelevant after first being explored. Oh, now you might be wondering why I haven't brought up the constant door animations? I didn't have an issue with it, its kind of the charm of enemies being trapped in one room which makes for interesting gameplay and for the Developers to give the players less ammo as Enemies can be avoided more often. Now I love Resident Evil games, its probably my favourite franchise, but when this is the first RE game which I haven't completed, giving up during the Infected Bat Battle, that should speak for itself. I understand games can't just keep doing the same gameplay with each subsequent game, but most of the new stuff isn't utilised as often or just takes away from the actual ""video game"" part of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ video game.",10.1 hrs on record																					(9.8 hrs at review time),N/A

Shotgun still clears most of them quite good. Game runs smooth on my 4080, I had only fps drop during first ""boss fight"". Only little dissapointment is that stalker stashes you find usually hold some kind of generic loot that is not really worth your time. Little ammo, vodka and piece of bread.

I just forced myself to finish it and like 90% of questes were so low: get me an item, kill all enemies in camp, kill leader of bandits... over and over again. There is damn no roleplay in this game as you cant really make any choice during quests or it is illusion. Combat system is so bad that you end using bow all the time because AI cant handle anything and they walk at your face when you sneak and cannot see you. You play light armored rogue, but fkin train heavy armor and shield just to get skill points to use in different skill trees. Bugged to hell, as I had 3 game breaking bugs.. still cannot buy a house at Ulfric city. You cannot sleep in the bed of abandoned house because ""bed is owned by someone"". Every enemey have same boring combat patterns. Even dungeons are copy paste assets that in short time you manage to know before you finish it. Graphic sucks.. but w/e I played it for a story not for graph.

Open world ruined game to the point there on same island you find a monster way to hard to even tickle it and easy ones that die one shot. Golden path was pretty fine, but so, so short i cant believe. I waste more time than playing Witcher 3 to complete it finally and feels unsatisfied. In the end it was hard to understand, where to go, to meet enemies on my level and follow game natural way. After i got max level 20 on all my characters it seems that all quest were pointless just giving me XP while i dont need them. No really a role play worth jobs to do. I felt like im forced to do side questes just to earn money to survive and to be able to follow main quest line. The biggest issue for me were Companions who were so restricted to go into only few classes, then have their political mind so stright like.. for ex. You cant have damn paladin companion without licking ass to the VTC, you cant have Serafin and same time getting one of the best magical Spears in the game. Ive tried to play stricte pirate way, being evil-gray character and it was pretty painful to make a good team this way. I do not count any mercenaries you can buy at the tawern because i dont play RPG game to have mindless companions who dont talk whole game. First 100 hours i was learning how to use mechanic correctly, to do decent damage and survive fights, same time not get bored by mechanic. Amount of time needed to spent on the internet browser to finally have a decent game changed it into torment. The low amount of magical items that are not Swords or Sabres forces you to do things against the roleplay. Like with that spear example. The rare magical items are so spread across the world, that you cant get them in a nice manner without spying on the internet how to get your set of items. Some bugs according to the scripted events are still there. Forced me to fight in few places most bloody and mindless way. Oh.. and ship battles are completly crap. The idea looks really nice, but in the end i didnt felt any rewarded by changing my small ship to a galeon or stronger one. Ive tried every available ship. Not a big tactic can be used there and ships during sea battles starts like 300m from each other, so using a long range guns is pretty pointless. ""Guns that rage is like from 300-600m"", 2 turns for turning the ship aside and enemy will be already 150m from you, to invade your ship. So you will shot just one salvo, and it will be inaccurate. The situations where enemy ships start combat at further distance from you are only in main quest missions scripted events.. yeah then i had 600m to enemy. Starting distance should be more random or depend of your skills as captain. Anyway, sea battles started to repeat badly fast and were boring. Main story: 7/10 Side quests: 3/10 Companions: 2/10 Romances: What? its a joke.

76561198072087471,3,N/A,Recommended,"Just bought it and played for like 5 hours, 4 games. AOE is really old game, but i remember it as nice experiance.. now.. im not sure. -Huge maps are not huge at all. -Music lacks the magic of ancient times, and sounds like happy utopia. It lacks war or drums feeling. I keep playing with original AOE soundtrack as its better. -Graphic is pretty nice, comparing to the old one ofc, but ui looks like to be finished fast to catch deadline. -Worst thing in this game for now i noticed is pathfinding. Units blocks with each other all the time, and its hard to do anything because if any 2 units get close they stand like braindead zombies not willing to move for few seconds, then they move again. Its 2019 and pathfinding for just damn 20-50 units should be something easy to apply to the game. - Another design that its really annoying is when you make a group of soldiers and try to give them orders. They will keep roaming around stupidly, so you have to click click every second to fix their attempts to suicide. What is even worse is a fact, that when you have a group of units, and want them to move closer to each other you usually click same point on map waiting till they hug in the area to get formation. Here? No way man! Dont even try! When you click move order to a group they will keep being spread but move a little left or right. So if i want my 6 swordsmen to stand one next to each other, i have to manually move every single one. Because no matter how long i will click move order, they wont gather into that point. Edit: - After more time playing.. no big change here. I dont remember if that was like this in original AOE, but when like 4 upgraded arrow turrets cannot fast kill one slinger.. something is wrong here. It looks like that for sake of balance they made towers super weak, which can be ridicilus when few cavalery units just ride by your base and ignore turrets. Just check how much turret can deal damage. Unless u upgrade it to balista (which not all civilisation can do) its useless. - I never was AOE pro, but i remember that original game gave me fun. Here im constantly losing games on lowest difficulty setting. Its a bit annoying. Thats the reason of difficult settings to let weak players interesting game and same for pros. Even if i finally win something, it doesnt really give any fun.. its just spamming units until somehow u have more than them. -AI is hard some way, but its terrible stupid in another.. for example. You can do Zig Zag wall labirynth as only way to your base, many turrets beside like 10-20 and enemy units will follow this damn zig zag getting hits from turrets, wasting resouces instead doing a proper siege with catapults.

It is absolute different experiance in medieval times... finally a good one! If you are in love with history, knights and medieval you will love it for sure. Its still a game through so dont expect it to be 100% realistic, however it still is in many ways. Closer than many other games i played. First u can feel a bit like playing witcher but no no.. there are no weirdo monsters. You can a little feel like person living that time.

You had nice dialogue choices, but it ends like no matter what you say, it ends same way. Comparing to main RPG games like Fallout2 or Dragon Age.. when one bad answer made NPC get killed and u suffer from it in future.. Here its pretty like no matter what u say it push u into the set line of story, and if you can choose dialogue that has any requirement - its always best option. It ends like i can just spam all answers not really reading them, cos story will go same way. If you play fallout 2 you never do that because whole city can attack you just because u threat the sheriff. -Combat classes and skills not that much intresting -Not really felt any racism like orcs against elves and so.. -Not really felt that my character sex or race have any impact to the game -No romances -Battle system were a bit annoying if you compare it to Jagged Alliance 2 where it was way better. When you enter combat area, in Shadowrun you have turn based movement all the time, even if u cant see any enemies.. in Jagged Alliance, turn based system started when combat started, so u didnt had to explore whole map using action points and being hold by turns.

Anyway, game is really nice in few aspects like Arts (really awesome draws), single player campain (there is multi too ofc), mechanic & tutorial looks nice and You dont have to pay to collect deck (even if in my feeling its a bit slow progress). but there is a problem with Magic Duels. Game is extremly unstable for me. It looks more like beta or something in this case.

76561198072087471,4,N/A,Recommended,"Another addon i've bought during sale time and this time i have to say iam totally satisfied. You can say its not worth the price, but well.. i get a bit used to Paradox prices. Anyway i will share my opinion about addon content: Map Sharing: I found this feature not really usefull. Well ofc if u are colonist nation then maybe, but if not.. There is a bit weird mechanic that prevent u to steal enemy maps if you dont have units in the region. Well.. to be honest i think this one dont really change much in game. Few times someone wanted to buy my maps and i get prestige from that. Naval Missions: Oh god, i love this so much. There are some missions that u always had to do manually. Now you can just order your fleet to blockade all enemy ports in region. I was also positive surprised when during war time my blockade was really, really long by map. Suddenly Casile fleet attacked little blockade at west coast and guess what.. All my blockade fleet mobilised and grouped to punish them for that. I didnt expect that, and it was nice to see. Barbary Pirates: Can be a bit frustrating at the start becosue they constantly robb you. Well just keep some fleets on hunt pirates mission all the time and You will be safe. AI players use every second when you cancel this mission so keep that in mind. During war time when you cannot protect ur coast good, they gona take some loot. Trade Leagues: Thats just nice thing. I really dont like to play republics you know.. but still i see it good idea. Becouse if you are one province-kingdom thats serious defense system. I saw it on the Rome, which was last province of Papal State as i took the rest. So to get that little Rome i almost lost whole war. How it works? Its like if you are 1 province only, you can join league of any Merchant Republic. If someone attacks you, all the league have to protect you. And ofc this ""alliance"" system works additionaly to main alliances what gives this little 1 province kingdom ability to be defended by like 8 countries.. SIC! But its fine for me, and seems balanced. To be part of league every 1 province kingdom have to give some power to the leader (merchant republic) Condottieri: I never used it yet.. well i think its fine feature. AI uses it time to time. Sadly i never had offer to use someone other army. But you can rent 25 stacks of your units to someone and its intresting possibility. EXTRA: So its a bit paradox... (Yay) but Paradox didnt say a thing about few more features. What i loves most in this addon is upgraded Spy Mission system. You get few new options just for ppl who loves to use spys. ""Lower enemies trade power"" ""lower enemies army recovery"" ""steal maps"" ""corrupt offices"" also you can send diplomat on Counterepisionage mission to increase chances to catch enemy spy! (+100% chance!!!) Also i have the feeling like there are some new random events, but cant confirm this 100% yet. So at the end i would like to say, go for it, buy it. If you like using spy or navy.

76561198072087471,4,N/A,Recommended,"Well.. i saw all these negative comments about this DLC, but wanted to try it by myself. So i bought it when it was on discount. Finally I have to say iam totally disappointed. I was sure its something like other ppl sayd - if u learn how it works it will be nice and u gona enjoy it. Totally NO. As i dont play Timurids or other Hordes in this game iam not speaking about this part. What i didnt like: 1. Estates: Estates looks like realistic thing to put Nobility, Clergy and Merchants as a part of... of what? Here we get its only part of PROBLEMS. Becouse literraly every event that can occur is negative by some way. And all the events does is about transfering power from one of these to another. Which ofc make u in danger or Disasters (nobility, clergy, merchants). As i played EU4 i get this game as simulator of medieval kingdom where You as a ruler decide what to do with it. Keeping reconstruction of 1444 world structure. Why the hell this addon trys to make you keep more thinking about internal economic more, than external politics. Every estate gives permanent 25% autonomy and you have to think OMG where to put Clergy becouse if i put it here i gona lose so much manpower/production ETC. Estates if used smart can give few ""click to get"" bonuses which has the price of risk to get Disaster in country. For me, its still not worth, as mechanic is too simple, and i have to care more about random events and problems it usually brings. For me Estates are boring, and innovation it gives is not worth of nerves u have to  spend to keep it NOT REVOLTING and NOT RUINING UR ECONOMY. Funny thing. If you wants to revoke the province what have estate game says its not possible (becouse estate) but same time, you can sell that province to other player. Logic? Favors: As estates, favors looks realistic at first time. To invite someone to war, you have to get enough amount of favors or promise him provinces from that war. Seems legit? Not really. First. How often did you attack someone not to get his provinces, but just to make sure HE WONT GET STRONGER. Provinces are not all in this game. Sometime u just want the world burn. Sometime u just want that France to callapse before it get too strong to handle. Favors ruin that idea. Becouse computer players are not willing to fight anyone unless u get favors/give provinces what is possible only if he is close to enemy. Border to border. I found it totally not realistic. Anyway its not end of favors problems. I hate favors for few things more. Second one is.. Ok if i play Papal State i get only 1 favor per 3 years, being in alliance with Austria. So to invite austria to wari have to wait 30 years, or 60 if i want to ""call to arms"" thing. 60 YEARS. SIC! This game lasts only from 1444 to 1820.. i dont want to wait 60 years to make one war, what wont give me much provinces (agressive expansion and province warcost). So favors thing actually made game much slower, boring.. u dont start wars so easly, you wait and farm... nothing happens.. gold in treasure grows.. ok i can have my 5 minutes.. ok lets farm for another war... ZZzzz.... Srsly. This system changed EU4 into farming game. Third thing i dont like is... Ok papal state cannot start war left and right.. You cannot start much wars without favors, becouse all players have defensive alliances, but its hard to invite someone to attack. How it impact the game? Another boring stuff. Only colossus like France, Austria, Commonwealth and so can start wars as they like, becouse they are strong enough to win the war without allies. Small countries cannot do ♥♥♥♥, becouse their only strength are alliances. Politics.. And small countries get only 1 favor per 3 years (with stronger ally). So, even if i bought this addon i usually play without it. Sometime i say myself ""come on u can learn it"" and i play game withit. Then get pissed off and turn it off. Srsly. There should be something like u can disable estates or favors in options and keep remaining content. Why i cannot just use the AI thing and set to my allies what provinces iam intrested in. At the end, sadly i want to say. Dont waste ur money on this one, uneless Paradox do something about it to be fun instead a pain in the ass.",0.0 hrs on record,N/A
