76561198192893105,1,Dice & Fold,"Casual, Indie, RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"The game is fine: you get what you expect — it's all about managing dice to maximize efficiency. Different heroes require different strategies, which is a good thing. The RNG is fair — it is a dice game, after all! My (minor) complaints are: - The descriptions of some effects aren’t always clear. - The balance feels off: the cost of some shop items, the usefulness of certain items and companions, and the relics you get after a run could all use some tweaking. In my opinion, it's currently a 6/10 game with the potential to become a 7/10. Not a masterpiece, but a solid game if you enjoy the genre and the art style.",4.4 hrs on record																					(3.9 hrs at review time),N/A

I am not sure why this doesn’t happen with Jupiter Hell: perhaps it is the enjoyable graphic that makes me able to recognize immediately the dangers so that I can cope with them. The fact is that I was able to finish this game! I want also to mention the price: usually I don’t like to spend more than 10€ for roguelike games. For this reason I was very unsure if to buy Jupiter Hell or not: now I can say that I am very happy and I don’t regret at all my purchase. Moreover the game is regularly updated and it is becoming more and more interesting and deep. Ah! The music is very metal: perhaps some players could not like it… (and, in my opinion, the very intense tracks of the first moon should be moved at the end: so that also the music creates a build up towards a climax… instead the music of the second moon is more relaxed...)",74.8 hrs on record																					(25.0 hrs at review time),N/A

What I mean is that when you find the solution then you can apply it in less than a minute: the problem (and fun!) is that to guess the solution could require a lot of time and thinking! Really a smart game! I can add that this game really exercise your brain: other games are brain intensive but part of their complexity is a technique specific of each particular game. In Baba there is not a specific technique: the difficulty is all pure logic. This means that even after a few months you can go back to Baba and you will be able to play the most difficult levels without restarting from the beginning because you forgot the ""technique"".

I solved the 60 levels in about 4/5 hours: usually they are quite easy and you can solve them after few attempts without too much thinking. PROs: - Many levels (60 of the base game plus about 40 extra) - Many different game mechanics (mirrored moves, checkpoints order, etc...) CONs - Sometime the many different mechanics are confusing (I discovered only after many games that there is a button that shows the rules of the level!) - The background music is nice but after a while it becomes repetitive. - The specific rules used in the level should appear automatically when you start it.

76561198192893105,5,Age of Fear 2: The Chaos Lord GOLD,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"I bought this game in a bundle together with AoF 1 and 3. All the games share the same engine and the developer updates all of them frequently: this is important because it means that AoF 1 and 2 are not obsolete compared to AoF 3: they just have different campaigns. I needed about 20 hours to complete both campaigns (orcs and demons) at the expert level (the 2nd of 4): however I found the orc campaign a lot more difficult. Basically orcs haven't healing units and the “berserker” trait makes difficult to disengage from combat to drink an healing potion; moreover the ranged units are very weak, only the goblin assassins, unlocked in the second half of the campaign, are useful. I found the story a bit boring and uninspired: the story is not so important in this kind of game but if it is interesting and makes you curious then it motivates you to play on. Instead the demon campaign story was very nice: the dialogues between the heroes (a demon lady and a knight) are very funny and I was curious to discover the rest of it. The demon campaign is also a lot easier: basically the player can summon a lot of imps (ranged units) and use them as cannon fodder to weaken the enemies. These games are not masterpieces but they are traditional and solid strategy games: I am enjoying them (I am currently playing AoF 3...) and I absolutely recommend the bundle, especially if in sale.",21.4 hrs on record																					(21.0 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198192893105,5,Age of Fear: The Undead King,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"This year, during the winter sale, I decided to try Age of Fear: I bought all 3 episodes in a bundle I started to play from the first one: Age of Fear – The undead King. I completed the two campaigns (about 15 scenario/battle each: roughly 5 easy, 5 medium and 5 hard) included (human campaign and undead campaign) in about 22 hours at “experienced” level (the second of four). PROs - The strange movement system based on circles is interesting and you must learn to exploit it to cover your range-units and to reach the opponent ones. - Many different units that gain experience and can buy new powers/abilities or evolve in more powerful units. - The AI seems quite good: I like how the enemy units change their targets and try to exploit their opportunities. - Looking at the achievements (I unlocked just 9 out of 21) there are many interesting secrets but I haven't discovered them because they are too well hidden! CONs - The strange movement system based on circles sometime seems unnatural (most units, beside knights and few others, move only in straight directions following the ray of a circle centered in their starting location). - The UI could be more friendly. Especially the equipment management window in between the battles. Instead the battle UI is okay. - The gameplay is very linear: just a series of battles. - What I really find annoying is, at the end of each scenario, moving around the battlefield with a unit to crack open barrel, chests, etc... to collect money/items. I found this search a boring chore. Probably is here that many secrets can be discovered but I hadn't the patience to spend 5 or more minutes to explore each map. Conclusions: The game is very old school style and I liked it: I don't complete my games if I haven't fun with them! The price/time ratio seem very good, especially the bundle during the sale. May be the replay value is not very high but in this case I don't mind. However the achievements seem juicy so, if you like to hunt them (I don't), you could have a lot of extra fun. In my opinion the strange movement system is neither positive nor negative: it has its plus and cons. Don't buy this game for this innovation but neither avoid it! Overall I suggest this game: it is not a masterpiece but, if you like the genre, it provides a solid experience.",22.8 hrs on record																					(22.7 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198192893105,5,Golden Krone Hotel,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"This roguelike game is easy, fast and funny to play. Unfortunately is a bit too simple: it is like the skeleton (mechanics) of the game is very good but is lacking the flesh (content) to buff it.

76561198192893105,5,Zaccaria Pinball,"Action, Casual, Indie, Simulation, Sports, Free To Play, Early Access",Recommended,"I have tried the FREE version. - The free table (the one not scored limited) is a bit annoying with the frequent delays when a part is moving (now I hate the voice “Now you go in the future” and “Now you go into the past”!) - The game physics is very realistic. The sounds are good and the controls feel right. - It is easy to unlock the first bonus table (“The mummy” I think) just playing once the score limited tables. Unfortunately that table is really ugly and empty. - Probably the best FREE feature is the “story mode” where you have to reach specific goals in several tables. It gives the player the opportunity to play and evaluate many other tables. - As free player you can try all the tables available (beside, of course, the achievements locked tables) but you are score limited: this means that you can play, on average, around 1 minute, sometimes more, often less. - the '70 tables in my opinion are only for pinball enthusiasts and not for the casual players: they are all very difficult and frustrating. Overall the game quality is very high (I have linux and there aren't other pinball comparable with this one) but I haven't yet purchased it. The reason is in the steep price and in how the single features are sold. Ideally I would like to pay 10/15€ for let's say 7 tables (for example 2 of '70, 2 of '80, 2 of '90 and 1 remake) included the possibility to change all the settings. Probably in this way I would buy all the set to complete the Zaccaria table collection in few months... [UPDATE: I bought the game! (See my additional comments down below) but I  think that my comments on the price policy are still valid] Instead currently I have 2 options: 1. buy the gold membership that gives all the tables + settings (called Bronze Membership). But it costs 44.73€ and gives me many tables I am not interested into. It gives me the impression of paying more for something unwanted. 2. buy single tables + “Bronze Membership” to change the settings (something really important for me). I saw “Bronze membership” list for 9.99€ in a bundle but I don't see it sold separately. However in this way I would spend 10€ for the setting and 5 x 2.50€ for only the tables that I choose: so something about 22.50€ that it is more than I like. Moreover if I invest my money in this choice then the bundle becomes less and less attractive and this keep me hesitant... [Update-13/Dec/2017] I should add that I bought the “Gold Membership” during the last autumn sale: in my opinion the price was still slightly expensive but now, after many hours of playing, I don't regret the purchase. In the first days I had fun trying to reach the first best 10% score in the leaderboard (3-balls, classic game) of each table; then I tried the same with the simulation (3-balls, simulation mode); recently I am trying the simulation mode with 5-balls because it is easier to unlock the achievements; now I am also exploring the many additional modes like the “checkpoint” or the “survivor” (basically you have to hit some targets in a limited time, with many rule variations based on the specific game mode). I haven't bought the “Platinum Membership” because it includes 15€ for the “Virtual Reality” expansion and I am zero interested in it. I prefer to choose which “remake tables” to buy, one at a time, when they are discounted. Currently I have two of them: “Circus 2017 table” and “Spooky 2017 table”. They are good (especially “Circus 2017”) but I don't play them much more than the older ones. The classic tables are unforgiving (sometime even frustrating) but when you start to learn their rules and peculiarities then they become very satisfying. Ah! Sadly the “achievements Tables” I unlocked (the first 4) are all very ugly: they are not only very simple but also uninspired. Also the old '70s tables are often simple but they are challenging and not shallow and soulless like these achievement tables...",275.5 hrs on record																					(53.0 hrs at review time),N/A

I think that in all my games (but one) I have met the annoying space pirates: the first time is “Wow!”, the second time you know already that you need at least 6 corvettes to win easily, after that it becomes just a chore. The huge galaxy becomes hugely boring. On top of this the UI is far from perfect: for example it lacks common features like a list/report with our ships (useful to decide what to build) or a list/report with all our space stations (useful to know exactly what is being built). The idea of the AI managing your sectors in theory is good but currently is badly implemented: the AI under performs and you cannot overseed it.

76561198192893105,6,Party Hard,"Action, Indie, Strategy",Recommended,"This game is a bit strange. Usually I don't finish my games... Nevertheless I was able to finish this game (included the bonus levels) in just less than 15 hours Usually, I am bad at games... Apparently, reading other reviews, this game is quite difficult but I finished it without reading suggestions or cheats. So what is so peculiar in this game? Why I (a bad player) was able to finish it? I think that not only the 8 bits graphic is old but also the philosophy of the gameplay is old style. This game is very unforgiving and, sometimes, frustrating: a small mistake and you have to repeat the level; you must notice small details. I spent about 5 hours on a single bonus level (the casino full of special forces) but I enjoyed all (well, most) that time: in every run I was learning something and improving a bit: in my last run I was able to kill almost all the special forces! Moreover you have to be patient: you have to wait for the best opportunity. Yes, basically this is a game of patience (and I am VERY patient): if you are in hurry don't play this game otherwise you will waste your time!

Overall I am very happy with my purchase and, if you are not looking for a puzzle or a tower defense game, I strongly recommend it.",48.2 hrs on record																					(21.8 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198192893105,7,Crusader Kings II,"RPG, Simulation, Strategy, Free To Play",Recommended,"UPDATE 4: with the Holy Fury DLC the game is great again! UPDATE 3: with the latest DLC (""Monks and Mystics"" and ""Jade dragon"") the game is losing what I loved most: the realism of the alternate history you were building playing it. Now many events and some game mechanics break the immersion and I don't enjoy playing it anymore. UPDATE 2: with patch 2.6 it is possible to enable/disable the two terrible changes introduced in patch 2.5: defensive pacts and shattered retreat. Indeed defensive pacts were improved with a patch  few week after 2.5 but the idiotic shattered retreat was still present. Now, finally, the game is again fun and I can reccomend it again... UPDATE: with the last patch the game has been ruined. Paradox has already confirmed that the problem will be fixed but until then I cannot recommend this... This game has a TERRIBLE interface that makes the learning curve very steep... But when finally you master it then the game becomes very satisfying. Overall my opinion is very positive but I suggest to buy it (and all the DLC) when on sale.",703.8 hrs on record																					(621.9 hrs at review time),N/A

The game is the worthy descendant of the dynasty and I found in it what I was expecting. Other people wrote better and more complete reviews so I will point out the only two things I didn't like: 1. Only watchtowers can be razed. It's a pity because razing opponent structures was an important strategy element. 2. The campaigns (at least the two I finished) are a bit short: their scenarios take a lot of time to complete but there are few of them. I would have preferred more and shorter (not easier!) scenarios. However these are just two details that I didn't like: overall the game is wonderful, so thumb up without hesitation!",195.4 hrs on record																					(183.6 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198192893105,7,Crowntakers,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"I played very little this game and the reason is that I don't like its core mechanic. This game has a lot of randomness but with little or no balance. The developers decided to compensate the lack of balance with a mechanic that allows the player to grow stronger every time he plays: but this choice is exactly what I don't like. I like games where I have a decent chance to win if I play without mistakes... Reading other reviews I have noticed most players are not concerned by this aspect of the game so, perhaps, it is just me... but I think it is fair to give my little warning...",3.9 hrs on record,N/A

My one complaint is that it feels like it can be hard to pick out a starting strategy sometimes - either because of the heroes you can pick from or the cards in the shop, usually the latter.

Great strategic game, forgiving for disconnects or when you get ganged up on unfairly and need to step out. I highly recommend getting this if you like Catan and similar games.

76561198082086866,1,Sentinels of the Multiverse,"Indie, Strategy",Recommended,"Very fun game, good way to spend a few minutes. Lack of online multiplayer is a bit of a bad point, the the introduction of a 5-pack may be a sign that they're working towards that. I also like how they offer season passes for their expansion packs. Haven't gotten one yet, but am considering it more heavily than if they offered them all seperately. Recommended if you like the physical Sentinels game, Co-op games in general, or board/card games. But reccomendation IS with a grain of salt because of the lack of online multiplayer. If you don't like any of these things, avoid this game like a plague.",7.9 hrs on record																					(4.0 hrs at review time),N/A
