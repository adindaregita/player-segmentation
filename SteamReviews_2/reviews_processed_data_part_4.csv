76561199013516841,1,N/A,Recommended,"Ok let me be honest, Dark souls 2 is not a bad game but at the same time it is not as good as I thought. Reason being the fact that before playing this game I've played Dark souls, which was a masterpiece(a complete package), like I still remeber that I wasn't able to forget about dark souls 1 for a week after I'd completed that game. Like seriously the day I ended that game I was completely empty, it was like I wanted more, I wanted to know more about the lore, the areas, the story behind all those characters, how did we end up in such a place and what not. I literally remember spending hours on research. And that was the best part about dark souls. Now when I played this game and completed it, I was like is this even a dark souls?! Like the story is not memorable, characters aren't intresting and the boss fights!! oh god, why were all those bosses so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ easy?!! literally it just took me 30hrs (excluding the dlc's) to complete this game, and when you compare that to dark souls 1....dude I literally spent 100hrs on that game the boss battles in 1st game are actual hard and meorable and that's what makes dark souls what we know it for. Hard boss battles, finding joy through frustration and struggle and finding our way through the game. And all that is literally missing in this game, bosses are easy, you already know what you have to do in the game, you know where you have to travel....like it dosen't give players a chance to figure things out for themselves and the good part is that yeah compared to it's predecessor this game has improved on the gameplay, as dark sousls 1 was pretty slow placed game. And the last thing to hate is it's porting like the  Scholar of the First Sin version atleast should have had a better port!....They did the same with dark souls prepare to die edition (though it has been fixed in the remastered edition) and now dark souls 2, though it's not a major issue if you get used to the controls but yeah players who are new to the series.....it's often frustrating. My final verdict, the game is not bad but when you play a masterpiece like the dark souls 1 and then hop onto dark souls 2 for the same experience you are just disappointed.",31.2 hrs on record																					(30.8 hrs at review time),N/A

76561199013516841,1,N/A,Recommended,Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 a legendary successor of Black ops 1 to be honest l wanted to play this game after completing black ops 1 but first of all it's pricing like every other cod games it's super expensive l was somehow able to afford it.Talking about the game Black ops 2 campaign is one of the best ones you can find in the Cod history after ModernWarfare this was the which made the history.And l guess this was the first Cod in which your actions or your choices had consequences.Well in short this game has many endings and all of them depend upon your choices gameplay wise this game is super like l hands-down to the gameplay as well as the story.Personally for me this game is a solid 9/10..........l just hope in future this game get's cheaper so that everyone is able to enjoy it :),25.4 hrs on record																					(23.8 hrs at review time),N/A

Well this game is also based on the wild-west  and it tells us the story of 3 brothers. This game teaches us that the path of peace and truth leads to a great and peaceful life rather than living the path of blood and lust.That's all this game is  really great l suggest all fps lover to play this game anyways before starting Red dead redemption 2 l thought l should get familiar with wild west and also with the life of a outlaw so l gave a shot to this game.And it really crossed the limit of my expectation.,6.5 hrs on record																					(6.0 hrs at review time),N/A

LOL anyways yeah everyone who who can run this game on their pc should give it a try it's worth it. And if you have already played Outlast 1 then you should definitely. This game is really big compared to outlast 1 and also really good. The thing l didn't understand about this game is that even after completing the game l didn't even get a single achievement.

Before playing, I do not recommend to look any of the guides and videos 'bout Undertale, 'cuz I want to you have a good time with this story. If u ask me, I had a great time on my videogame life after a really long time. I am so happy for Undertale and its developer, Toby Fox. You must open the sound while playing, 'cuz this game has really good - best soundtrack. And my favourite thing is, old computers can run this game smoothly.

This game is not one of the games that you can install and play immediately. So, let's into the problems. Firstly, this game sometimes not detects mouse. That happens in old version but this version has much more. Trying to fix is a bit of challenging but it can be fixed. After mouse is working, there is a problem too. The FPS Limit is a problem for gaming (Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas designed for consoles, it's because much problem on high FPSs). If you want to play stable, then you must open the FPS Limit (it limites to 25 fps) and it is really bad situation if you have gaming pc to play games (it happens in old versions, too but in this version it is much worse). Then the graphical problems we have. In version 1.00, the vehicles bodies could be clean but after 1.01, vehicles dirty everytime, and it still exist in the new Steam version. I hope Rockstar fix all these and everybody doesn't need downgrade their games. The story is really great I recommend that. Peace!",0.8 hrs on record																					(0.7 hrs at review time),N/A
