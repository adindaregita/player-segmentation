And oddly no freemium mechanic, i was surprised at first when i saw i needed gold to unlock in game stuff... and then PLEASANTLY surprised when i saw you couldn't spend money on gold! It all comes from playing the game, challenges, online, AI, etc. Back to the good old days of when you had to play instead of pay for more in game content. Solid online multiplayer experience too, enjoying it so far",22.8 hrs on record																					(9.6 hrs at review time),N/A
