76561197977775722,1,N/A,Recommended,"Most of the game seems fun.  For the challenges alone though, the devs earn a well-deserved negative review.",58.7 hrs on record																					(11.2 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197977775722,1,N/A,Recommended,Excellent little puzzle game - maybe a little like minesweeper.  I look forward to playing the others in the series!,3.1 hrs on record,N/A
76561197977775722,1,N/A,Recommended,"Endless time-wasting, no manual saves, enemies appearing from thin air (and cleared areas), clunky interface, repetitive fights (how many times do you need to beat the same group of enemies?)... Don't waste your time.",27.0 hrs on record,N/A

76561197977775722,1,N/A,Recommended,"The skirmish AI ruins the game.  Expect to face a titan every mission in the second Space Wolf campaign, with a 50% shield that activates >90% of the time (literally: 8x shots blocked in a row from a dreadnaught).",28.5 hrs on record																					(28.1 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197977775722,1,N/A,Recommended,"Update: This issue now appears to be fixed, and seems to have been a bug rather than a save corruption issue (although I have no idea which bugfix has applied to the game).  I can now wholeheartedly recommend this game! Original: This is a great game, but sadly a recent update has caused savegame corruption to randomly occur.  Unless you can complete your game in one sitting, this product is now useless.  The developers could - if they can't fix the underlying problem - at least keep a series of autosaves and have the game fall back to a previous save if a reload fails: better to lose a round or a turn's progress than 6 hours of play!",182.6 hrs on record																					(161.0 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197977775722,1,N/A,Recommended,A very good physics puzzle-platformer that comes within a whisker of not outstaying its welcome.  For the lack of a an auto-rolling ball halfway through the last level...,3.6 hrs on record,N/A
76561197977775722,1,N/A,Recommended,Low-quality platforming that lots of people seem to compare to Dark Souls... presumably these are the same people still stuck in the Undead Asylum.  Playing it feels like the developers have grudgingly permitted you to intrude on their art project.,2.6 hrs on record,N/A
76561197977775722,1,N/A,Recommended,Game is bugged to make Steam think it is always running.  Fixed by restarting Steam and quickly uninstalling the game.,3.7 hrs on record																					(3.5 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197977775722,2,N/A,Recommended,"Update (October 2020): a new developer has taken over the game and looks keen to resolve the issues I found when I last played - in particular by making single-player mode fully offline!  If this works out I would probably change this to a recommendation, because the actual gameplay is very good. Original review: Buggy, poor UI, and with a nonsensical online requirement that happily torpedoes your progress at the slightest blip in your internet connection.",9.9 hrs on record																					(8.6 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197977775722,2,N/A,Recommended,A glitchy mess that I finally had to abandon after it corrupted the save file.  The third game in the series that still has numerous bugs unfixed from the first game.  The developers did at least choose an accurate name for their studio.,39.5 hrs on record,N/A
76561197977775722,2,N/A,Recommended,"This is a really good game... that continually annoys the player with pop-ups after games.  ""We're on Android/Iphone!"", ""We have another game out!"", ""Are you enjoying the game?  Leave us a review!"".  Well, here's your review.",27.4 hrs on record																					(24.1 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197977775722,2,N/A,Recommended,"Glitchy, obscure controls (with either keyboard-and-mouse *or* gamepad, which is quite an achievement).  The only reason I can see to play this is to understand why Assassin's Creed and other ""parkour""-type games use third-person view: so you can see what's going on and control your movement (at all). Maybe the game was a revolution at the time of release, but now this is one relic best left in the past.",0.9 hrs on record,N/A
76561197977775722,2,N/A,Recommended,"It's... fine.  Combat is in the style of the Batman: Arkham games, but with less precise controls (targeting specific enemies with special abilities is an exercise in frustration), whilst the open world gameplay and missions are closer to the Assassin's Creed series.  It's enjoyable enough for the length of the main game (25hrs on my playthrough), but I'm not keen to delve into the DLC for more of the same.  Be aware that the difficulty peaks early, then the game gets steadily easier as you develop your abilities and attributes, since no new enemies are introduced past a certain point. Ultimately, I'd recommend the Batman: Arkham series over this for the combat, or the Assassin's Creed series for a stronger story... but if you've played all those (and Mad Max) and want something similar, or just *really* like Middle-Earth, then you should find Shadow of Mordor to be reasonably fun until something better comes along.",25.7 hrs on record,N/A
76561197977775722,2,N/A,Recommended,"A nice idea, but hampered by an obtuse interface and poorly explained systems.  Equip a (defensive) field projector ""weapon"" for a team-member?  Hope you remember that it's middle-click and hold to apply it to someone!  Suits provide power, but it's never clear how much you have in total, what's using it, how it recharges or what will happen when it runs out.  Even moving your team around is an exercise in frustration, since your carefully prepared formation (e.g. guns in front, tech guy in back) will be happily ignored the next time you group-move them. Would've benefited from more feedback for the player, a clearer interface that didn't sacrifice usability for the theme, and - just generally - more time in the oven.",2.4 hrs on record,N/A
76561197977775722,2,N/A,Recommended,"Nice to look at (graphics are a little too busy in some areas, which caused me motion sickness - but alleviated using the in-game settings), with an interesting story.  Since the game is about puzzle-solving at the behest of a disembodied voice, the Portal series is the obvious comparison, but sadly this does The Talos Principle no favours: the puzzles are numerous, but often repetitive and became a slog long before the various endings became available.  The levels are also not helped by being enormous - expect to spend a lot of time running around, even when you know how to solve a puzzle area.  Could have benefited from half-as-many levels, with more puzzle development between them - as it is, the story is the only thing that persuaded me to grind through them all.  Perhaps consider this review ""lukewarm"" rather than negative, particularly if you plan to play the levels in shorter bursts over a long period of time.",20.2 hrs on record,N/A
76561197977775722,2,N/A,Recommended,"I really expected to like this game, based on the art style, turn-based tactics, having enjoyed SteamWorld Dig.  Sadly, the game is overly focused on grinding levels, due to the bizarre loss mechanic. Completing missions normally gives you water (cash) and experience for the bots that participated.  If a bot is ""killed"" (perhaps ""junked"" would be more accurate) in a mission, then they gain no experience.  If you lose or abort a mission, you lose half of your total water.  This leads to annoying situations where a bot gets killed, but you must press on with the mission to avoid the water hit... then still have to replay the mission to get experience for the bot that died, plus a full star rating for the level.  Want to save time and just abort so you can replay immediately?  Well then, say goodbye to half your water for wanting to save yourself some grind!  All of which could've been avoided with the simple option to restart a mission at any time (losing any loot and experience picked up on that level only), or with a turn rewind option to even out the random ricochets that cause unintended bot losses. Far too frustrating to play because of this loss mechanic, but otherwise a good game.  If you don't mind wasting your time grinding, consider this review a positive, but otherwise I'd suggest looking at alternatives like Invisible Inc., XCOM, or Shadowrun.",24.8 hrs on record																					(9.2 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197977775722,2,N/A,Recommended,"An excellent ""digital boardgame"".  Makes good use of the dice to bring tension to each decision, whilst giving lots of room to make use of your crew, resources and ship facilities to influence the odds. Contrary to what many reviewers are saying, the random element is fairly low - it's far less than than in, for example, FTL - and easy to minimise with careful play.  Poor decisions (not bad rolls) limit your later options however, and I suspect many people are rushing to act each turn only to doom themselves later.  Like a good boardgame, this is best not played in a rush; you have 'only' 10 turns, but expect that to be a 1 or 2 hour game if you're considering your choices carefully. At the time of writing the devs appear to be actively engaged in further expansion of the game, introducing new missions (scenarios) to mix up the main game.  New characters are unlocked through in-game achievements, further expanding the replayability.",10.8 hrs on record																					(6.7 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197977775722,2,N/A,Recommended,"Nice graphics, sound and animation, but a lot more of an ""interactive animation"" than a game; what puzzles are present are really no challenge.  Some effort at an emotional journey but if it fails to resonate - as, I fear, it did with me - there's not much to hold the remainder together.  I was glad to finish the game and move on to something else.",2.9 hrs on record,N/A
