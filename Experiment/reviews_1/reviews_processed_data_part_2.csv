76561198201248007,1,Beacon,"Action, Indie",Recommended,"Beacon is a stylish roguelike that definitely deserved way more than being delisted. It's not perfect, it has quite a few bugs and feels unpolished at times, but it's undeniable that this is fun and has a lot of variety. Just by looking at the achievements, it seems there are quite a lot of bosses and endings too. I won the game on my third run a run that lasted more than 2 hours, luckily I got a pretty powerful sniper that killed almost everything with less than 5 shots. The world feels alive because there are factions, and they fight amongst themselves, really making you feel like you are in an uncharted, chaotic planet, and frankly? Feels great. I like Beacon, and I don't regret paying for it considering it is now free, would pay again. Good stuff. Give it a spin, you won't be disappointed.",5.0 hrs on record,N/A
76561198201248007,1,Batora: Lost Haven,"Action, RPG",Recommended,"Soooo… Batora: Lost Haven. It's fine, good even! It's one of those games that starts weak but gets better and better by playing each chapter. In the beginning we have an uninteresting combat, corny teenager dialogues, the premise is meeh, and even the first worlds are bland. But every new level, skill, and choice makes the game more and more deep and engaging. The story has really interesting consequences, it gets better and more dense with each new chapter, the dialogue gets more dramatic instead of corny and is well enough dubbed, and, of course, the combat gets better with each new skill gained. Just making it clear, the combat starts bad and gets better, but it's not phenomenal or anything, it's just decent. Lacks impact, lacks feedback, lacks ragdolls, lacks intensity, the skills are well animated, but it just feels like you're hitting markers instead of enemies. A BIG problem is that the game does not cache the shaders, so every time a new effect appears on screen, the game has that stupid Unreal Engine stutter… Gets annoying but eventually goes away for a while. In the end, Batora: Lost Haven is a decent ARPG, with passable combat, an interesting story with consequences and multiple results, great graphics, an interesting story with consequences and multiple results, sprinkled with a decent soundtrack, and bam! You have yourselves a pretty decent game!",8.3 hrs on record,N/A

76561198201248007,1,The Vagrant,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG",Recommended,"The Vagrant is a good game. It's not perfect, by any means, but it has a lot going for it. The combat is good, the art style is hand-painted and is high quality, the enemy designs are well made, every enemy feels like a threat (even when they aren't), the world is beautiful, especially that sunset part on a tower where the dropped gold/mana blooms on the screen, the soundtrack is consistent and plays at the correct moments, MOST* of the bosses are fun to fight, and I always enjoy some decent aerial combat. The story is actually nice! I'm not sure why every woman looks like a pornstar... But it felt original enough to be compelling, and I actually wanted to see how it was going to unfold, Love the fact that when you die to a boss you see the consequences of what happens when you fall, it's fun, specially the Shrooms. Maybe I will come back for the true ending later. * ♥♥♥♥ the last boss lol. It's not HARD because you can always use potions, but the last two phases of the last boss are annoying as hell. I played on Hard difficulty, and I really had to cheese some potions for the first time in the whole game. I got the true ending, it was pretty easy overall.",14.1 hrs on record,N/A

76561198201248007,1,New Super Lucky's Tale,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"New Super Lucky's Tale is an absurdly well-made collectathon. With charming visuals, gorgeous animations, cool music, super tight gameplay, and a charismatic cast. Honestly, it's one of the best ""mascot"" platformers around! It's a game formulated for kids, so it's not really a hard game at all. The last optional level has a little bump in difficulty, but it's still pretty easy overall, and that's basically my only critique. All mechanics work well, there are multiple kinds of levels, and there's a lot of creativity going around this game. Definitely an easy one to recommend if you like 3d platformers.",10.8 hrs on record,N/A
76561198201248007,1,The Falconeer,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation",Recommended,"Okaaaay, The Falconeer! Game about flying in giant birds destroying flying ships. What could go wrong? The Falconeer is a charming game. The lore, the worldbuilding, the story, the dialogues, the politics, and the birds! Of course! It uses some Steampunk stuff, and I like that very much thank you! The graphics are also very good, with minimalist textures, and it looks very good most of the time, and the water is superbly animated. For a world that looks like Earth in a few years, it looks pretty darn compelling. :) But The Falconeer has a few things that detract from the experience, of course, the biggest offender is the quest designs. It's always catch that, kill this, deliver that, and the worst missions are present, of course: ""ESCORT MISSIONS"". I sincerely don't understand it, some missions are literally 3 minutes of BABYSITTING a ship that's slower than a slug. I literally dropped my controller and let my bird fly alone on multiple occasions until something happened on screen. I am also not a fan of how the game is structured. Like, it has chapters, but each chapter you lose your bird cuz now you're someone else from another house, and your 12k full of mutagens badass bird is now lost… Start again from scratch, Sh*tface. Why??? In the end, I don't love it, but I don't hate it either. Love the universe, love the combat, love the flying, hate the quests, hate the structure. I am not a city builder player, so I hope the dev revisits some more aerial combat gameplay in the future, with more varied missions, and preferably less escorting... I slightly recommend The Falconeer.",9.4 hrs on record,N/A
76561198201248007,1,Dread Templar,"Action, Indie",Recommended,"Dread Templar is a super competent boomer shooter that's filled to the brim with interesting mechanics, varied maps, and great gameplay. The game also has a serviceable upgrade system, with weapon upgrades, weapon variations, and other cool shenanigans. The story is basically a simple revenge tale, it serves its purpose, but it's not explored nor compelling at all. I wish the game had headshots for all weapons, not just the Bow and Revolver, the enemies can be a bit tanky when using other weapons, and it feels much better to kill them with those two headshot weapons. The levels are visual spectacles and are cool to explore (Love some red moons), even though the secrets are maybe too well hidden for my small brain. Overall, I liked it quite a bit, when it was starting to get boring, a new weapon showed up, and when it started to get boring again, it ended. T19 understood the assignment and crafted a worthy boomer shooter that is easy to recommend for fans of the genre.",9.0 hrs on record																					(8.9 hrs at review time),N/A

This is it, if this is not enough to you, just begone. No but seriously, after playing the prequel I was curious to see how Samurai Punk would enhance the formula here, and they added so many cool mechanics, the game is absolutely fun. The story is dumb as rocks, but the gameplay about a human-eater roomba that hacks traps and ignites enemies while punching them with a Stand, it's just unbelievable. It was a blast, thank you!

76561198201248007,2,Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"Ooooh well! Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy! Coming from Marvel, which I consider one of the most sterile entertainment companies in the current world, Guardians of the Galaxy. Never been a fan of it, never heard of it before the movies, never watched the movies, but an action game with good recommendations made by the awesome Eidos Montréal studio? Sure! Why not? It was so much more… Damn, what an experience! Guardians of the Galaxy is phenomenal! Basically, all regarding gameplay, story, dialogue, soundtrack, graphics, and scenario are top-notch, real AAA. I legit burst out laughing several times and even had watery eyes on some emotional scenes. After the Avengers: The Game kerfuffle, I really wanted to stay the ♥♥♥♥ away from the Marvel + Eidos combo, but they succeeded in basically all regards here. This is a jewel, a gem, it has no GaaS elements, no DLC, no Microtransactions, it's a 20+ hour HONEST game, all killer, no filler. Gameplay is phenomenal, you control the Star-Lord at all times, but the other Guardians skills are at your disposal at almost all times, so you can basically use all skills at once, and hell yeah! Chaos and Fireworks!!! And those characters? Amazing! Love my bro Drax The Destroyer! My only critique would be the performance, some slowdowns, some framedrops, some bugs that forced me to restart checkpoints, and getting stuck on geometry, but for a 20+ hour game, having to reset twice considering the checkpoint system is pretty good? It's fine! In the end, I love it! It probably didn't get the love it deserves, so if you're on the fence? Go for it. You will AT LEAST appreciate it, I guarantee. It's pretty Metal. Guess I'll go watch the movies now huh? Get some more Drax vs Gamora dialogues, why not!",23.1 hrs on record,N/A

I have a 4080, and with DLSS + FrameGeneration I could get around 120/130 FPS, but without these tools, max was 40. DLSS + FG have some visual degradation of course, some stuff looks ugly (like particles or smoke), but the game feels smooth and input lag is acceptable, so the technology is great. It was great to experience these two levels again, it really shows how great HL2 was and still is.

The best thing about this game is just to roam around a decently built city with decent enough graphics. Everything else spans from subpar to horrible. The worst offender here is the combat, it's not fun, enemies just overwhelm you, and you simply don't have enough space to aim your weapon. Maybe a real melee would've solved this, not that pathetic kick. The story is… confusing, to say the least. There's a disease, then spoilery stuff happens, and now a woman the MC never saw before is the most important thing ever for basically no reason. Maybe the book develops this, but the game... eh... I would definitely lean more towards a ""mixed"" rating, but since I don't have this option and not a single real reason to recommend it, then I won't.",2.7 hrs on record,N/A
76561198201248007,3,Neon White,"Action, Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"It's good good good—hell, it's GREAT! Neon White is an awesome Speedrun (GOTTA GO FASTUR) game with very competent visual novel storytelling. Awesome skills, powerful weapons, mechanics with depth, cards-discards that are blazing fast, and lots of fun! Getting all those aces was very satisfactory, it's fun to just replay some levels again cause you KNOW you can squeeze a little less time in it. Most routes are linear, but the game taunts you to break it. ""I could save a second if I don't use this card now"" is the most frequent thought that passed through my mind while playing it. The characters and dialogues are incredible (mostly). You actually want to search for the gifts to have more unique moments with them. Ah yes, the gifts, TOUGH ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, some of those things were hidden by literally Satan and require more finesse to get than the actual levels. The story is also good. I expected some corny background for all the action, but it's actually creative, entertaining, and interesting. The soundtrack fits perfectly with the game thematics, it's fast but not annoying, it's relaxing even. It complements the game without being distracting, and I never felt the need to lower the music's volume as I do with most games. In the end, I leave Neon White very satisfied, it's just loads of wild fun! I love the color Red.",19.3 hrs on record,N/A
76561198201248007,3,Trover Saves the Universe,"Action, Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"It's fiiiiine. It's completely stupid, as expected. Humor is the most important part of the game, gameplay is fine, it's one of the few ""2nd person games"" out there (Where is Driver San Francisco, Ubisoft, ffs!), the story makes no sense, but that is also expected too. The planets are nice to explore, the combat is as barebones as it gets, and the mechanics are eeh... Play it if you're a fan of Roiland's work, but this leans way more on the toilet humor than his other projects.",5.2 hrs on record,N/A
76561198201248007,3,Wavetale,Adventure,Recommended,"It seems the game internally forces the 1080p resolution, even when you choose a higher res, which makes the game completely ultra mega ass on a 1440p monitor. Like, really, it's no joke, game looks horrendous, the pixels just break, compress, and look like an ultra-low-bitrate YouTube video. Yuck. Devs/Publisher promised a patch in the forums over a year ago, looking at SteamDB, the last update was Nov 17 2022 (even before the game came out lol). If a patch ever comes out and fixes this, I will play the game and leave an actual review.

76561198201248007,3,Trek to Yomi,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"Trek to Yomi is both a masterpiece and also a very boring game. It really depends on how you look at it and what you expect from it. As a tribute for Kurosawa? It couldn't have been better. Aesthetics? Nailed. Soundtrack? Nailed. Story? Nailed. Voice Acting? Nailed. Camera? Nailed. The technical aspects of Trek to Yomi are superb, the hauntingly beautiful feudal Japan, with all the misery and despair, is very well portrayed in the villages and scenarios of the game. It's sad, depressing even, literally black and white, hehe. It also feels like a game with quite a lot of passion and budget, clearly, Leonard, FWH, and Devolver invested a lot in this game, as the animations and scenarios are really top-notch. It really does not feel cheap, it convinces. Could've been a great movie too. Now, as a game? Eeeh... You see, it's not BAAAD, it's just very mediocre, and in contrast with the awesome ""all of the above"" I listed, it leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Combat and movement are very mid, they're not bad, just uninspired and could be better. Better moves, better animation, more gore, enemies could be more varied, have different moves, maybe another melee weapon, idk, it's so repetitive, the game does not evolve, you get a few ranged weapons, but these are very boring to use too. Also, the game is very easy, posing basically no challenge on Bushido difficulty. And last, quite a lot of ""Unreal"" stuttering, this engine sucks as usual. Maybe if the game precompiled the shaders, it would be less stuttery? Who knows. The size of the game is good, but all the repetitive fighting makes the experience feel so long, while it's barely a 5-hour game. If you are looking for a cinematic experience, this is an easy recommendation. If you are looking for an action game, maybe look elsewhere. I know I had a blast with the universe of the game, but I recognize the gameplay may not be for everyone.",5.6 hrs on record,N/A

McPixel 3 is a great game, sadly, it is NOT EVEN CLOSE to the monumental achievement that is McPixel 2 (which I accidentally found in an ominous blue floppy disk that appeared on some street dog's poop). Some of the puzzles are just completely impure, it breaks you, it speaks to someone or something deep inside you, or maybe it's just some cabbage I ate earlier, idk.

76561198201248007,3,Night At the Gates of Hell,Action,Recommended,"Yeah, this was... uhm... strange. The heavy reliance on jumpscares kinda ruined it for me at the beginning, first because jumpscares are more annoying than fun, but the spooky atmosphere is not bad, and it gets much better as the game goes on. The shooting is all over the place, some spot-on headshots don't register sometimes, and you end up dying or losing a knife. I find it an okay experience, don't plan to play it again, but maybe give it a try if these weird shenanigans are to your taste. Extras: Booty Creek Cheek Freak is just some stupidly ridiculous game, and I mean that in the best way possible. Fight hard so you don't get... Decheekitated...

76561198201248007,4,CrossCode,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG",Recommended,"Well, it certainly took a while, but I finally finished CrossCode. When starting it, I never thought it would be this grandiose. Crosscode is a gigantic game, stuffed to the brim with content, that is in my opinion, both a blessing and a curse. First, let's start with the good. Which is QUITE A LOT: The Story... It's incredible! While it feels light-hearted at first, it touches some deep existential themes and will leave you thinking quite a few times. The way the story is told is very consistent, all the main characters are well written, have great visual designs, their dialogues are consistent, and it's fun to see their development as the story goes on, but they never lose sight of who they really are... As cynical as this sounds for this game. It plays great, it has good, precise movement, awesome combat, and great interactivity. The combat is just exceptional, it has those elements, long range, short range, and the special arts are just pure insanity (especially level 3). The enemies and bosses are usually great, some aren't (more on that later), but most of the bosses felt beatable and fair, even though HARD AF. CrossWorld oozes charm, the world of the game has several different regions that look and feel awesome to explore, and that aligned with the awesome graphics, incredible pixel art, and a great soundtrack, makes the experience one level above other games of the genre. All maps are fun, feels metroidvania-ish, but it's not really that. The cities are well designed and nice to explore too. It's supreme! Some mixed feelings: Well, Crosscode is not an easy game, it's clear from the deep combat and powerful enemies that Radical Fish expected you to suffer a little, and it's fine. There are a few things I don't like, like enemies that fly or go below the ground, those can be boring to beat, but there's always an easy way to kill those. It's a fair combat, some bosses are brutally punishing, but nothing is unfair or has issues with telegraphy. Also, it's pretty rare to get hit out-of-screen, but it can happen sometimes. As for the bad: The puzzles, oh boy... You need to have a huge brain to beat CrossCode without help from guides or something. Even some chests require you to have a degree in 4D chess to obtain. And hard puzzles are not a problem, I like puzzles! BUT, like I said, CrossCode has CONTENT, it's a huge game, and yea these hard puzzles everywhere and at all times can get very frustrating and annoying. The dungeons are immense, some with over 1 hour long, filled with pixel-precision puzzles and unique powerful enemies. Yea, these get annoying too, especially in that part where there are 3 dungeons in a row. I don't like when my open-world game restricts me into a dungeon for that long. Now, my biggest gripe with this game is the controls. Seriously, I HATE the controls. It feels subpar on kb/m, and it also feels subpar on gamepads. You need to be precise, but the melee combat in the keyboard is just HORRENDOUS, you need to keep the cursor above Lea while using the direction in the board to attack in that direction. Why not use M1 for Melee and M2 for Ranged? I just don't get it, and you can't rebind mouse buttons too. I had to keep switching between gamepad and kb/m, so it was gamepad for combat and kb/m for puzzles and menu navigation. Conclusion: In the end, CrossCode took me around 60 hours to beat (save time), which is quite a lot. In Steam, I have logged almost 93 hours, but that's mostly because I got tired of the game on some occasions and went to watch a video or do something else with the game open. Honestly, I feel like it overstays its welcome a little, but it is not that the game is filled with filler, it's just too much to do and discover. The DLC has a good change of pace, so it gets better. The DLC dungeon is by far the absolute best of the game (more on that in the DLC review). Overall, I think CrossCode is one of the best indies around. While it has its flaws, the good parts are just too damn good.

76561198201248007,4,BELOW,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG",Recommended,"Below is an interesting and intimidating game, much different from everything I have ever played. It's strange, humid, solitary, somber, and most importantly, SILENT. Water droplets, rain, rocks dropping, small animals, fire burning, all those things can be heard clearly, the soundtrack is soft, and in the end it contrasts with the silence, making the loneliness even more apparent. You are nothing in this giant vertical island full of immense structures. It's combat, albeit simple, is fast and relentless, one mistake and you're dead. You have to carefully plan expeditions, food, water, and remedies because the survival aspect is also steep, and you can die easily. I decided to embrace the challenge and play the game on Survival Mode. Gotta say, it feels incredible learning all its nuances in order to avoid deaths, but it can also be extremely frustrating, learning to deal with the losses is also part of this experience. Overall, this is a very unfair, brutalistic, and intense game. I don't know how different the Explore mode is, but Survival will make your blood boil on several occasions. Beating it, though? Makes it all worth it. I strongly recommend Below, if you are up to the task. 🎼 All of my stories are Below; Beneath the surface, cannot grow; Curled and naked I defer; To shaky thoughts, all in a blur. 🎼",20.5 hrs on record,N/A

76561198201248007,6,Far Cry® 2,Action,Recommended,"Far Cry 2, this debt with my past is finally paid. Incredibly, this is the most technically advanced game Ubisoft has released, and honestly, one of the most advanced games ever made. The physics, the graphics, the FIRE (MY GOD THE FIRE), the gunplay, the animations, the foliage, wind, it's just superb and it aged like fine wine, does not feel dated at all. Far Cry 3 and 4 albeit more fun games, are way less impressive than Far Cry 2 was and still is to this day. It's not all flowers and sunshine tho, FC2 can be a boring videogame at times, especially if you consider where the series went in the future. Far Cry 2 is more akin to Far Cry 1, less story, less talking, more gameplay, more immersive, it makes you feel like you are a mercenary working for both sides of an ugly conflict and profiting for it while Afrika's people bleeds, and while the writing is very confusing and the motivation of MC less clear than petroleum, I still had a lot of fun with it. In the end Far Cry 2 did not became my favorite in the series, that still is Far Cry 4, but I really wish the devs took the technology further instead of castrating it in future iterations. It's a good game, impressive technical aspects and good shooting, but it will not change your life that much, still WAAAY better than Far Cry 5 and New Dawn that's for sure. P.S: I played this game using the mod ""Vanilla + (Tom's Mod)"" from Nexus Mods. It removes the ugly filters and has some quintessential balance changes, QoL and fixes, also, it's heavily customizable for your own liking.

It really does feel like this game was cut short. When the plot starts to get absurd, it just ends. It could have been a MAJESTIC bridge game to a third and conclusive Deus Ex with Jensen, unfortunately, we all know where that went... It sits in the same weird and sad position as Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus, the perfect bridge game, without the definitive conclusion to the trilogy.

And so many great ones, so I figured I had to give Deus Ex HR one another go, and I am glad I did. DXHR is a game that respects your intelligence, it provides secrets, unknown paths, cheeky hidden codes, vents, A LOT OF VENTS, several ways to do the same objective, or a different objetive and with the same final result, or different final result, the list goes on... When you think some small thing you did does not matter, IT JUST DOES. Even today, playing I see it for the greatness it constructed (Golden Filter aside), but I wish I understood it when it was in it's prime, back in 2011.

Nothing is really explained, combat is mid-to-good, but I finished the game and there was nothing that differentiated the begining from the rest of it. There are basically 3 missions that you keep repeating with increasing difficulties. You have to... Pay... to start a mission, so if you have not enough money to start one, you need to go outside and keep farming. Weapon rarity is all over the place, in fact I only found 4 weapons from the 6.

The last few levels I played tho, not fine, in special the boat/pirate level, that one is completely broken. I had to reset a few levels multiple times because a door would not open, or my character would get stuck on geometry, or the vehicle physics were crazy. Also, the last stretch kinda sucks, the dark forest level almost put me to sleep and the last boss did not cause damage at all even on Natural Born Killer difficulty.

As for the bad... I got stunlocked so much during the game that I was more infuriated than having fun. if you are stuck in a corner, you will take MASSIVE amounts of damage before you can escape. Also, whose idea it was to lock the Tag Team mode behind the campaign's end? I wish I had that one from the start... Like, I see how these are not real problems if you play this game with more people, but I normally play my games alone, and most beat 'em ups let you switch characters when you are playing solo, it would have made this game so much more fun, but I don't plan on replay it just for Tag Team.

76561198201248007,13,Just Cause 4 Reloaded,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"Ok... So... Just Cause 4... Just Cause 4 Reloaded is... absolutely fine. That's it, fine. Not awful, not bad, not horrendous like some people say, it's just fine. When compared to JC2 or JC3, yeah, not good looks, but looking at it as it's own game, it's fine, even great at some fronts. Just Cause 4 finally has a different story than ""overthrow an authoritarian regime in Central America"", also, finally some character development too, Rico is a bit more grumpy than expected, but still a good character. The story has... Something! They tried for once, it's no God of War but it gets the job done, and of course, ends on a cliffhanger. I will never forgive you if you don't give us a JC5 Avalanche >:( Gameplay is better in every way imaginable (M/KB), some things were added, some removed, some changed (don't know who had the idea to auto-retract the tethers >.>), but overall, I still like it. Much easier to control Rico in the wingsuit and use all the gadgets. Gunfight is still the same as JC2 and JC3, and by that I mean that it still awful. Using the rifles feels like you are shooting stone statues with a healthbar and that's it. No impact animations, no blood wounds, no physics, no gore, once their health reaches zero, the stiff statues become a ragdoll, and that's it. Use explosive weapons or shotguns, believe me, much better. Action is still awesome, destruction physics are the best of all JC games, the tornadoes ripping through the land and taking everything along with it is marvelous, I do wish we had more control of the weather effects tho, it's pretty complicated to control the Tornadoes for example. Ah yes, the turret sections are fun too. The mission structure is... Strange, you have to release a few regions to unlock main missions, it's fine tho, can get tiresome but nothing extreme. I just played the main campaign, wasn't in the mood to 100% the game, I just released the regions and made the main missions, had a pretty decent time, but if you do all sides it will probably take forever and be boring. Graphics are a mixed bag, the horizons looks beautiful, the explosion effects are among the best I have ever seen, the particles, fire, rain effects, all brilliant. As for the atmosphere, it has a darker tone to it, specially when compared to JC3, it's taste, I like it but I get those who enjoy a more vibrant experience. As for the bad, man, the lightning and texture work of the cutscenes are HORRENDOUS, my god, what happened there? Literal PS1 textures, sometimes the hair glitches, Sheldon looked like he had metal hair and beard on some cutscenes, the cutscenes are waaaay too dark and low res (literally 480p), I don't know why they did it, the in-game cutscenes are MUCH better. Last, of course, the ocean, yea the water is strange man, while it looks good at night with winds, during the day it looks like paper. Awful. The performance is also fine for me, no framedrops at all, not even in tornadoes, the FPS is completely stable, much better performance than JC3 in all possible fronts and I had a single crash while playing and reproducing a stream on my second monitor. The only stutters I had was when I completed a leaderboard challenge, but once I disabled those in the menu, no more stutters. As an old time fan that played all JC games (Really old, JC1 on PS2 was fire), I actually like it. Not the best Just Cause, but not the atrocity people make it. I would give it mixed rating, but since I like it more than dislike it. Soft recommended.",16.3 hrs on record,N/A

The tethers mechanics are even better than JC2, and you can get really creative with the destruction. Driving is ok but useless, I mean, Rico can basically fly. Now, for the bad. The LOD is just broken, sometimes things don't render and you have to destroy invisible planes, sometimes the game stop rendering stuff till you restart. The game does not have different sensitivities for controller and M/KB, all in one slider, so... yea... Also, I pretty much hate that most interesting glider upgrades are locked behind Superman 64 style annoying minigames. Also, I WILL NEVER FORGET THIS, but they removed the blood decals of the game in a patch and never restored it, the game had working bullet wounds on enemies and they just took this off. This is the first time I see a company just removing a working feature out of the game for nothing and no one mentioned it anywhere.

And... It's actually pretty fine. As the previous DLC, 90% of your choices has no palpable consequences, but at least the story of this DLC is not a complete assault to my senses like the previous one, it's actually interesting for the most part. Even the present parts are passable, if you believe this! We get 3 RIDICULOUSLY AWESOME areas to explore (SERIOUSLY, THESE AREAS ARE PURE ART), an actually interesting story to play through, new useful skills, and very... Interesting depictions of the Gods of Olympus. Hades is just HOT. This DLC is actually worth it, not great as AC Odyssey, but it's good.

The DLCs... This... Disgrace here. What is this? Why this exist? The biggest surprise in Odyssey for me was the different outcomes the quests had, but this is just railroading all the way through. They just FORCE you through the story, even if you don't comply with it. Forced romance, forced killing, forced everything. Even Kassandra got annoying here. Look, I like the idea of a Persia DLC, and the Darius vs Amorges (AMOGUS???) part of the DLC was good. Actually, Darius was nice, the DLC has it's moments, but for these moments they had to basically butcher all my experience in the game. Spoilers: Who had the idea of taking the most annoying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ character in the game and forcing a son on Kassandra with it? Seriously? I would rather have a kid with the blacksmith of the broken spear than Borinakas. All my romance options were negative, I disliked that dude from the beginning, yet, at the end of chapter two, all my disdain became... ugh... A timeskip with an annoying child. Kassandra here is disturbingly bad compared to the writing in the main game and The Fate of Atlantis DLC, completely forced, hysterical, I get it she's a mother blah blah blah, but this is just so out of character, makes zero sense. Seriously, if you don't plan to take all the achievements, DO, NOT, PLAY, THIS. and I can't stress this enough.

76561198201248007,18,Raji: An Ancient Epic,"Action, Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"This one is tough... Although there is a lot to like here, some other times... Let's start with some good, the art is pretty nice, it's not common to see a game inspired by Hinduism being made so kudos for the team to doing something different. A positive about the combat is that there are 4 weapons and they really vary a lot. It's no Hades but each weapon feels different to play with and requires different approaches to combat. The writing is nice, you will learn a lot about Hinduism if you pay attention to the conversations and murals. As for the bad... Well, sometimes I wonder if the game was tested at all. Like, nothing is horrendous, but they put you through some really tough ♥♥♥♥ through the game that it is CLEAR that the quality of the movement/combat is not enough to handle it. Some of the fights, although not HARD (due to overabundance of healing), are just a chore, enemies are way faster than you, your evade moves are slow, and the last boss really made me question my sanity for a few minutes... The Last Boss: PLAY IT WITH MOUSE AND KEYBOARD. Even if you played the whole game using a controller, the weapon given to you just DOES NOT WORK with a controller. FOR REAL, I beat it first try with the mouse. Who had the idea to tie the movement of the weapons with the direction you're moving when 95% of the fight is evading (when your character is not even fast enough to evade some moves). You should have used the right analog to control the chackra disk , not your movement stick wtf. Also, the man who though the snake part was anything but annoying... man... Although I complained much more than I complimented this game, I still think it's a fine game. I definitely will not print flyers and recommend it in downtown, but definitely check it out.

So many situations, so many things hidden under the hood, just to show you a very well-written story, with a diverse cast of characters (that you will most likely love and miss ), all rounded up in a pretty decent management game with cool exploration. Thunder Lotus art is now on another level, this puts their previous work to the test and surpasses in every single technical detail. The art is mesmerizing, the style, the designs, the drawings, how well though everything is. It's just too stylish for me to handle, it's awesome. The writing, I have to talk about that but not much so it won't ruin it for you. The game's writing is sublime, the character motivations, likes/dislikes, mood, activities, quests, it's just grand, and also shocking at some moments. Now, why did I call it a decent management game? Well, the game has a few shortcoming in the gameplay department. Although all the minigames are fine and the cooking is INCREDIBLE, the late game can be very stressful, where you have to wait for some events to trigger. Of course each player will have a different experience based on which characters they get or not in the boat, but truth is, my experience could have been better. I found the RPG dude waaaay too late, and had to wait for his quests to trigger, like, literally wait... While watching a video or something. Another issue is that it drags on for too long, although the new characters are awesome, not sure if they didn't hurt the flow of the game, in this case, maybe less was more? I wouldn't sacrifice any of the characters tho, they really are awesome, so... Yea... Overall, Spiritfarer is awesome, it's a game I will cherish, recommend, and remember for a long time.

Although I still consider Watch Dogs 1 my favorite (Due to the overall mood, slightly better characters and better story), W_D2 is absolutely a great game, with refined gameplay formula, more freedom and also interesting characters and story. My personal fun story with W_D2, was that I bought it full price on the PS4 and dropped the game in less then 3 hours due to it's annoying teenager characters and definitely millenials-trying-to-please-zoomers writing, that is not true tho, the game develops into something far more interesting later on. I love the San Francisco they built with this one, even more than my beloved Driver: San Francisco (Bring that to sale again ffs). The game has a lot of shortcomings (physics still sucks, some keybinds are questionable (esc cuts dialogue and also is the button to leave a hacking interface), flickering shadows bug in RTX40 series, soundtrack could have more metal (one single metal song, come on). But I do recommend it, for sure. The game does not feel bloated to the brim with useless content as latest Ubi games and is actually a neat package. Ah, the DLCs are pretty good too. Now, I will leave the comments open, as a fan of W_D1 and W_D2, should I play W_D Legion?",35.6 hrs on record																					(35.6 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198201248007,22,Okami HD,Adventure,Recommended,"Okami is a masterclass of videogame design, specially in 2006. Clover and Platinum are amazing and will live in my heart forever. It has things that have aged poorly, that's for sure, but the game is one of the most original experiences I have ever seen. The game is awesome, from art design, to character design, to story and even the combat is interesting. Of course the Brush mechanic is absolutely incredible even today, it's flabbergasting to be honest. The only critics I can think of are that the game is too dragged on, too long and the menus/dialogues are very long and some even unskippable when you have already finished reading. The game has no voice over, so I don't see why you need to wait once you already read. Also, the port is not that great. It's as barebones as it gets, 30FPS, the LOD of the objects is the same than in the PS2, the game is basically the PS2 version with a higher resolution, so if you already played it back in the day, you don't need to play Okami HD. If you never played it tho, it's a must. Also, please bring God Hand to PC :))))",29.4 hrs on record,N/A

76561198201248007,24,Quantum Break,Action,Recommended,"Quantum Break is a strange game, TV shenanigans aside, it has a compelling, complex, interesting and well written story about time traveling and it's implications. You actually have to search for information, the choices you make actually changes the course of the story, and reading an email or text might be the defining action for you to make choices in the Junction levels. I don't want to spoil but reading these things make the story a lot more richer than it already is. The gameplay is fine, it's no Max Payne or Control but it get's the job done. The powers are a little clunky and some guns are awful, but nothing gamebreaking. The show that comes attached to it was... Unnecessary, but not horrible or a catastrophe like I read around. Like, it thought it was going to be way worse than it actually is, it's a fine show to watch and dive into some characters, but I would rather play the levels instead of watching this. The scar Xbox One left in this game is real hehe. The scenarios and the broken time effects are absurd, they nailed it perfectly, things you blew up come back after a few seconds, stuff you destroyed rewinds, people you killed are stuck in their death positions, it's pretty incredible what they managed to do. The visual aspect is definitely my favorite thing about this game. The end battle is pretty annoying too, the game crashed three times in that battle. The story ends on a cliffhanger, but since Remedy is Epig's lapdog nowadays we will probably never see the continuation of this fine story.",13.3 hrs on record,N/A

76561198201248007,31,Scorn,"Action, Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"Scorn was not what I was expecting at all. I've been following this game since before the Kickstarter campaign, the impression I had was that this was going to be a survival horror game with more focus on inventory management and combat, but the truth is that this is a very linear game and is heavily focused on puzzles. I blame the developer that marketed the game like this. It was obvious that the game shifted focus during development, we were not really warned and in the end we got a completely different product. Is it bad tho? Do I regret my preorder? Well, not really. Although Scorn was not what I expected, it still was a VERY compelling experience. This game has dethroned Bloodborne for my favorite game art and ambiance. The sound design is gruesomely spectacular. Giger would definitely love to play this. It's disgusting, mysterious, strange, and evokes a very strange sense of ""Whats coming next? How more can it suffer?"" In the end, the feeling of wonder became even more wonder, because I wanted more, I wanted to understand more of the games lore, which is only told through environmental storytelling. It could have more meat on the gameplay bones tho, more combat, more enemies, more weapons, more bosses, it was 8 years of wait and the gameplay was the most neglected aspect for sure. In the end, we got a short, brilliant game that I would recommend to anyone, albeit with all it's severe flaws.",5.4 hrs on record,N/A

76561198201248007,35,Vigil: The Longest Night,"Action, Indie, RPG",Recommended,"Vigil The Longest Night is a brilliant Metroidvania with a few nasty issues that detract from the experience. First the good, Vigils art style is brilliant, it has that bloodborne-esque vibe with the unending night and tentacles enemies that ofc were inspired by H.P. The enemies are REALLY varied and very creative, there is a nice variety of armor/weapons (including THAT armor set ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), pretty good combat overall, with manual powers akin to those in fighting games (I personally adore it) and a great story in a great setting. It is a very solid game in almost all aspects, except... The bad, well, the worst offender is the ""point of no return"" after the act 1, it simply doesn't warn you, doesn't tell you anything and if you haven't played the game once, there is no way to know this is a point of no return. The results is that you basically lose a lot of sidequests and equips if you don't explore the whole area before this point. Second, is the combat, well, the combat is pretty good overall, except for the enemy feedback, they are all premade death animations and I think this is the most boring way to do it. No gore, no physics, just, kneel and disappear. Obviously this is a nitpick, but these are the only things I can complain about this game. Also, I accidentally sold a piece of a set to the smithy and it is basically gone forever, so be cautious about it. Not a complain because it was my fault but don't commit the same mistake as I did, there's no way to buy them back :P Overall, incredible experience and if Glass Heart can continue bringing this level of quality, they got a big fan here.",16.9 hrs on record,N/A

76561198201248007,35,Lichdom: Battlemage,"Action, Indie, RPG",Recommended,"So... This game... Is... SURPRISINGLY GOOD! Normally I look at the Steam reviews, so read them and think... 57% positive, well, maybe I should pass? This game was on even thinner ice after the FIASCO that was The Culling 2 and The Culling Origins InCrEdIbLe monetization scheme. Now, here I am, 4:47 AM and I am about to write why you definitely SHOULD give Lichdom Battlemage a chance. TLDR: Amazing game, great combat, good presentation, too long... This is a really weird game, that I don't get why it's so hated. Like, yeah he's a little hard, and yeah, he's too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ long (I mean it), but if you take that away, we've got magefan's wet dream™. There is a lot to unpack here, the story is... ok I guess, the voice acting is surprisingly good, even the writing isn't bad, I had a few good laughs with the jokes the Gryphon told me along the way. Now, about the combat, it has so many options, so many spells that if you don't like the combat, it's 95% your fault for not doing the spell you'd like. What, you like to play shooters with a shotgun? You can do it here. Rifle fan? You can ""kinda"" do it here too! You love the bazooka? You're at home. You can do basically anything with the elements provided, and there are a lot of elements here. The synergies are another show entirely, my first synergy was ice-fire, and that tornado made me grin every time I cast it, 10 mofos flying in a coldhot tornado mwhahahaha The Graphics, wth it's a 2014 game that I swear if it was released on 2022 no one would complain it being bad. Seriously it's a beautiful game and I was flabbergasted at the magic effects, they are the most beautiful magic effects I've ever seen and that's no small feat. The lighting and texturework are also pretty incredible for the time and they are pretty nice even for today's standards. About the gameplay, yeah, you can't jump, but that's it too, the biggest sin of the movement system is that you can't jump. But is it a sin? IMO no, because if you could jump, the combat would become laughably easy and they would have to rebalance the whole game for a mechanic that I honestly didn't missed here. The dashes are more than ok (And you can change your shield tipe for more dashes :). Now, I don't know what happened in the launch of this game that tainted the reviews on Steam to this day (Maybe Xaviant Shenanigans?), but at least the version I played of this game, it don't deserve half the ♥♥♥♥ it receives. Like I mentioned, yes it's too long but that's my approach, if you're the kinda guy who wants the biggest bang for your buck, this has a lot of bang for almost free. In conclusion, it's a flawed game, but it shines so bright that the flaws are easily overlooked. Call me crazy, but I loved almost everything here and I was pretty happy to see that Xaviant actually KNOWS how to make good games. It's a shame this one didn't flew as it should.

It tries to be God of War, it tries to be Shadow of the Colossus, it tries to be Assassin's Creed, but if you remove the name Castlevania and the characters, it easily passes as any generic game out there. It's not even a metroidvania ffs. Slow boring parkour, QTE's (with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ button mashes), boss that you need to escalate to hit a weak point. But the worst part, is that it doesn't respect your time. Oh you opened a door? Cool, 15 seconds unskipabble  animation of the door opening. Oh you changed a part in the puzzle? Great! Another 15 seconds of unskipabble animation. That permeates the whole game I can GUARANTEE YOU that it would be 2 hours smaller without this garbage. So with all that said why is the game a recommended? Well, because Steam doesn't have a mixed setting yet, aaand sometimes the game is pretty good!

76561198201248007,42,Dying Light 2 Stay Human: Reloaded Edition,"Action, Adventure, RPG",Recommended,"Dying Light 2 is... Almost there! Edit: And now, Tencent bought Techland, my hopes for this game are dead. Like, this is my MOST awaited game, I am a giant fan of Dying Light 1 (To the point where I even reported bugs on the Techland Forums) and it was one of the reasons why I bought a PS4 back when it was released (Along with Bloodborne FOR PC WHEN SONY™) and I bought it again on my PC to play it once in a while, real gem. My ""review"" will be based on the prologue and a little gameplay of the open world, and is more a first impressions of things I miss from the first game and things I enjoyed from it. The good: GENERAL GOOD - Looks like everything was expanded, the story looks huge, the map is pretty well designed for parkour, and the combat looks pretty nice besides a few animation/physics issues. GRAPHICS - The graphics are beautiful, no joke, it is beautiful. It's not super top notch, but considering it is an open world game, it is phenomenal and probably the best I've seen so far. ART STYLE - The art style is brilliant. The game has that apocalyptic vibe but nature has taken over. It's pretty hard to nail this but at least in the first area, they brutally nailed it. OPEN BUILDINGS - The open buildings are back, very expanded, and it is incredible, this new mechanic where the zombies stay hibernating inside the buildings is really cool and adds a lot to the grittiness of the game. Mixed: ATMOSPHERE - Something about the atmosphere of the game looks too different from the first, the color pallet is very vibrant and kinda loses the horror vibe the first had. It's not worse, just different and unexpected. GUNS - Guns were probably removed, this is also not something that doesn't damns the game and I respect that design choice. I feel weird about it but not necessarily bad. Edit: The game is way better without guns to be honest! Harder to cheese. The bad: PHYSICS - The physics are really bad, although Techland already said it's a bug, some zombies never fall from your kicks, and the animation from kicking them out of a building is horrible. It's like ""walking on the air, oops, ledge, then ragdoll to the ground"". It looks like old cartoons and not natural at all, was incredible in DL1, looks bad on 2, but since it is a known but they will probably fix it. Edit: Getting better and now better, but still has a long way to go Techland! BLOOD ON SCENARIO - The blood kinda goes... Nowhere? Like, they have physics for it, looks amazing, but then it falls on the floor and vanishes, this didn't happen in DL1, it just doesn't look natural and was definitely a downgrade, which is very sad. Edit: This also looks better, but the fountains of blood still go into nowhere, a shae really. WOUNDS - I didn't see any wounds in the hits I did, once again, comparing to DL1, no Cuts, no visible damage, just dismemberment. Maybe I was unlucky but... I've seen other people talking about it so... Edit: The visible wounds were added back on the Gut Feeling update and they look VERY GOOD, I still miss the little dynamic cuts tho. XRAY - The XRAY effect was not present in any of my kills, although it was badly executed in DL1, they had a brilliant chance to make something amazing in the sequel, sadly it seems they just removed it (Again, played only prologue and a few minutes in the map). Edit: Techland also added this feature back, not as good as before but better then nothing, good job Techland! THROWING WEAPONS - Yeah, that was removed from the game. It was a cool feature, sad to see it removed. Yes I am aware there are throwable weapons in the game, like knives and spears, but I am talking about throwing your main handheld weapon, like machetes/pipes etc. DL1 had that, removed in the sequel. THE WATERSHED: These are the two most atrocious things about Dying Light 2, and the reason why this ""review"" is a no instead of a yes and why I refunded the game too. They are probably linked, but no matter. THE PERFORMANCE - The game is mostly stable, had a really high framerate (Among 90FPS in 1440p Digital Foundry settings). So why am I complaining? Well, it's a stutterfest! When I attack? Stutter. When I jump? Stutter. When I interact with something? Stutter. This may be linked to the next session of this review... Edit: Runs a lot better, but there is run for improvements yet F-------- DENUVO - Of course, they slipped this garbage on the game in the last day before launch. OF F- COURSE THEY DID. I don't know how much this affects the performance, since there is no way we can compare it with a version without this bloatware, but you know... It's the same feeling I had when playing RE8, same stutter, exactly when pressing a button, and that was solved when Denuvo was patched... So... Yeah... #FKDRM Edit: Denuvo Remuvo happened, thank you Techland! CONCLUSION - I am a huge fan of Dying Light, and I LIKE Dying Light 2, the dev team is clearly very (VERY) talented and the game oozes potential and style, but is it worth it right now? No... No way it is. They charged R$ 369,00 for the ultimate edition of this game, that is expensive... REALLY EXPENSIVE... Just so you have a perspective, the minimum wage of Brazil is R$ 1.212 right now. Do I plan to buy it again? Absolutely! As soon as they remove the bloatwareNUVO and fix some of the issues, I really plan to buy it again. Although I really enjoyed my brief Hour with Dying Light 2, it's simply not worth full price. You don't trust us, you add horrible DRM, you don't get the full money. (I also never did such a big review, shows how much I care for this f------- game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥). As promised, Denuvo removed game purchased, a game I could've purchased for 100% price on launch was bought with 50% off due to Denuvo. Hope it was worth it for you Techland, cause I'm sure I was not the only one. Tencent is now the owner of Techland, and WHAT'S THE FIRST THING THEY DO TO THE GAME? That's right! A IN-GAME CURRENCY. What could possibly go wrong? Also, several proof in Reddit that they will shamelessly add P2W microtransactions into the game. I no longer care, F# Tencent and F# Techland.",12.4 hrs on record																					(1.1 hrs at review time),N/A

I am on the Great Game side, thank you very much for asking!!! But I'll say more, DmC is not just a great game, it's an AWESOME game! Ninja Theory already proved their talent previously with Enslaved, they just know how to make Hack n' Slash action and they are magnificent at it, but here it's their prime, this game is phenomenal to play, it feels nice to nail the combos, there is meat on the bones, brutal and honest comboing for dayssz! The artstyle is just amazing, a capitalist dystopia corrupted by demons (JUST LIKE REAL LIFE), it's gritty, gray, enticing, it portrays lifelessness while being full of life, animated, crisp, crunchy, I just can't get enough. All sprinkled with an awesome industrial OST that was clearly made with love. Overall, I get why the longtime fans hate it, it has a different DNA than that of the original DMC series, if the game had another name, it would definitely be more loved than it was back in the day. Nowadays tho, it's clear that it aged like wine, more and more people are discovering this one, and it's just amazing to see.

Dante kısımlarında ise aynı haritayı geriden başa gelerek tekrar oynuyoruz ve Nero ile kapıştığımız aynı bosslar ile tekrar kapışıyoruz üstelik oyunda 5 tane falan boss hatırlıyorum döne döne aynı bosslarla savaşıyoruz.

76561198253517283,3,Depth,"Action, Indie",Recommended,"I really enjoyed playing Bully: Scholarship Edition, although due to it being a PC port of a PS3 port of a PS2 port it suffers from several techincal problems, like the game crashing if you have more than 2 GB of RAM in your system, although this can be solved easily by removing the excess RAM from your computer when playing it. The game places us in the shoes of James ""Jimmy"" Hopkins, in the game you'll experience firsthand the most accurate representation of what Boston's Private schools are like, you'll interact with midgets, frustrated professors, and homosexual schoolmates, but you'll also experience life outside school, which resembles more of a 1950's detroit with crackheads, tramps, and most frightening, chavs. Gameplay wise it's a toned down Grand Theft Auto, it features lots of features present in these games but some are removes due to the school setting (to be expected from a company like Rockstar Vancouver, refusing to extend the meaning of ""art through games"") but overall is a pretty engaging experience, you'll have to complete the main story missions as well as having to attend classes, which perfectly imitates the stressful life of a 4'2 bald student in Boston, something of which I couldn't relate to until now. The story is somewhat decent, James decides to bully his classmates into submission until he does so to the entire school, closely mimicking the events that took place in the British International School of Boston in 2007 during which 7 lives were lost (Rest in piece Jack Knoxarts). Overall Bully: Scholarship Edition proves to be another great game with fun mechanics, engaging gameplay loop, and interesting themes, a must play.",5.0 hrs on record,N/A

The lyrics depict a gentle rain that washes away pain and suffering to bring them to a peaceful life, attempting to wash away the pain and suffering of one man in particular, but having no effect as the man has seemingly given up all hope. Upon realizing it has no effect, it transitions from a peaceful rain into a violent storm in a desperate attempt to erase the man's suffering, only dispersing on realizing the man is completely dead inside and is beyond hope. These lyrics seem to reflect on Monsoon's own life from his early childhood as a survivor of the Cambodian genocide, leaving him the nihilistic and hopeless man when encountered in the game.",80.6 hrs on record																					(59.5 hrs at review time),N/A
