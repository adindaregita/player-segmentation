Your entire existence depends on water and you can build floodgates and dams and levees to direct it wherever you choose. In the wet season you need somewhere for all the water to go- in the dry season you need to carefully manage your storage if you're going to make it through. Fun times, very chill, and stacking up homes and warehouses is extremely compelling. Highly recommend!",98.5 hrs on record																					(98.0 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197999259031,1,N/A,Recommended,"Single player tableau builder with an engineering theme - find parts on your wanderings and add them to your starting parts then distribute them between your two squaddies. Connect colored generators with various outputs- create healing potions, shoot lasers at your enemies, slow them down, speed your team up. Every turn you have to solve a puzzle by deciding what to power to both damage your enemies and deny your enemy's actions by manipulating the turn order. The game's reward mechanism rewards quick defeat of enemies so you have to balance risk vs reward. There's a lot of randomness- there are only a few enemy types and groups, but the parts you as rewards or sitting waiting to be taken are drawn from a good-sized pool. Some rounds you find a really cool combo, and some rounds you limp along. It can be uneven, and feel unfair that none of the parts you found seem to work together and you get stuck in a downward loop of bad rewards until eventually you are beaten a stalagmite and some sort of time-storm. (For example.) Anyways, it's mostly fun and when it's good, it's very good. I strongly recommend. A really interesting design with a lot of room to grow and refine into something great.",5.2 hrs on record,N/A

76561197999259031,1,N/A,Recommended,"Cute city-builder, but frustrating and shallow. Frustrating: No grid snapping feature- walls and paths are a pain to line up. Buildings, too. There are overlays for ore and soil fertility, but nothing else. Want to see if your parks and such are reaching your structures? Too bad, won't happen. Random events pop up but they have minimal impact on the game. Seasons change but the only difference is that your pops need more fuel for their houses in the winter. You can't click on a given pop (perhaps you're curious where your miners live) and you can't check who's working where. There's list of your people but you can't do anything with it. Shallow: People don't seem to care where they work- miners are as happy as fisherfolks, who are as happy as farmers, etc. Population simulation- your pops want luxuries appropriate to their class, but they don't care which luxury and there's no effect to any of them. They're either happy because they have Furniture or unhappy because they don't have anything. Your king (or whatever) asks you for resources but there's no downside or time limit. Fill them at your leisure. You also seem to get nothing from it. You can't track inputs and outputs, or see what's going where except to watch people coming and going from place to place. No meaningful traffic / congestion mechanics and if there is, I can't see one. It doesn't matter if everybody in your town uses one road to go in and out. There also aren't any carts, wheelbarrows, or other contraptions. Everybody just walks. Social dynamics underdeveloped- some of the random events make a given social class more or less happy or safe and that's about it. Workforce management boils down to 'leave some people as workers and assign the rest to a class of workplace.' You can adjust the numbers of workers at an individual workplace but that's tedious. There's also no way to prioritize certain kinds of work so if your situation changes you're back to changing the number manually and then watching your stockpile grow or shrink. Maybe the game changes substantially after 150 pops (the highest I got, in my second attempt) but I'm not really interested in finding out. I built supply lines for my candle-making shop and had an excess of every possible supply and spent the tail end of my time with the game waiting for more pops. I hate waiting for more pops. Even at 10x speed, it feels like everything takes forever to happen. Maybe in a year or two I'll come back and change my recommendation. If you enjoy the game, good for you. I just kept wondering when I'd get to the good part. I feel like six hours of focused play is enough to decide if a game is worth more of my time. This one, at this stage, isn't.",5.7 hrs on record,N/A

76561197999259031,1,N/A,Recommended,"Highly recommend. It's a roguelite in the spirit of Dark Souls, or maybe Bushido Blade. You play as an amnesiac in a truly bleak world, fighting your way through scores of bandits and wizards and monsters. Smash (or burn) nearly everything to turn it into raw materials to upgrade the weapons you found along the way, or make an offering at an altar you find. Manage your stamina in battles, and your spacing. Dodge or parry enemy attacks to create the opportunity to swing your own weapon. Walk slow to try and notice traps (or ambushes). Mementos give fun and interesting bonuses to your stats or abilities.

76561197999259031,2,N/A,Recommended,"Strong recommend. 8.5/10 17 hours in- the game feels like Slay the Spire turned into a roguelike. You build a party of up to three adventurers out of a pool of nine and develop their decks over time as you overcome challenges and defeat enemies. Every time you level, your character gets a skill point, which gives you new cards to add to your deck, increases attributes, whatever. You know how these work. The cool twist is that you actually build the skill tree yourself- every 4 levels, you choose between one of three skill tree chunks (forget what they're called in game) and you stick that on there, too. The net effect is that you're not only building each character's deck, you're also building their skill tree as you go. This also means that the game's complexity increases as you play it, so what was once a super simple decision between a few cards becomes a piece in a larger puzzle. This also lets the game's characters develop organically. It's super cool. Oh, and each character has three pools of cards they can draw from, so you can choose as you build your skill tree whether you want your Druid to have another Primal card or an Elemental card (or whatever your class gets up to). Each card pool has a set of somewhat synergistic cards, and you can decide at any time outside of battle to temporarily remove cards from your available set or add them back in. It's a lot, but it's really satisfying to build a custom character and a custom party with lots of synergy. I will say, the game is on the easy side. So far (I'm on Act 3) I have had three character deaths- one at the first act boss, and two at the second act boss. Since you can see where the enemies will attack and what they attack with, it's pretty easy to just attack and then as your last action, move out of range. For example. I'm hoping the game gets harder, and gives me a reason to take some defensive cards or gives me room to play with some more unusual builds. There are some other odd design choices, to be sure, but they're pretty minor, relatively. Camping is fun but sort of mechanical. I found a lot of characters have camping abilities that I don't get much use out of, and there's no way to change those moves or swap them out that I could find. Very disappointing. The exploration sub-maps never give enough room to really explore or roam, and I find myself simply going directly at the most valuable map node and then leaving the exploration zone. What a missed opportunity! Anyways, if you can't tell, I really like this one and I think it features some great design.

Really tightly designed and I very much enjoyed my time with it. After 10 or so playthroughs, it does get old. Some of the mechanics that felt novel get repetitive. And so on.

This is kind of like that, except applied to a nation-builder, and designed by a team with a shallower grasp of the subject matter. Things don't quite link up in the way you'd expect, sometimes. That can be an asset or drawback, depending on your perspective. Mostly, I found myself organizing spagetti-tangles of interlocking cause and effect into something resembling order while a small icon somewhere offscreen tells me that my trade routes are causing inflationary pressure or something. My solution, as I recall, had me adjusting levers on other small icons until a chart looked more level. This is essentially the gameplay. It's also real-time, so you can choose between waiting ages for ticks or possibly missing something urgent. If that sounds exciting to you, build on!

76561197999259031,2,N/A,Recommended,"Thoughtful and methodical turn-based strategy game. Great AI. Expand your Bronze Age realm into new territories, build cities, and squabble for land with other civilizations. The first civilization to reach a pre-determined threshold of Victory Points wins. You can get Victory Points by attaining population levels, amassing wealth, claiming territory, building armies/fleets, and capturing cities. The amount of VP changes per-match and can be customized. There are a handful of pre-made maps, with pre-determined historical starts. The selection of civs is excellent- try your hand at the mercantile Elamites, or the expansionist Mycenaeans. My favorite is the larger Mediterranean map, although the smaller Ganges Plain map is entertaining as well. Matches tend to take me between 45-90 minutes. The game is intentionally simple- no diplomacy or age progression or tactical battles. I don't miss it. Your AI enemies are opportunistic but they're not insane, and so wary detente and mutual indifference are enough. Highly recommend to strategy fans in general, and history fans in particular.",31.9 hrs on record																					(18.6 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197999259031,2,N/A,Recommended,"Gorgeous deckbuilding roguelite in the vein of Monster Train or Slay the Spire. Your adventuring party of 4 embarks on a nearly impossible quest across a series of landmark locations. You can see the whole map in front of you. Each hero has a different deck and can be built in various ways. It feels like there are 3-4 archetypes per hero that can work, and the game is a constant balancing act between trying to make 'poison' or 'shields' work and making do with what the game gives you. If you like drafting, you're in for a treat- each hero has its own deck, and you draft 3 cards for each hero after every battle- and the game is mostly battles. As a result, after a couple of fights, your deck starts to feel customized around your specific situation. Given so much freedom, it's fairly easy to build a totally awful deck and until you understand how the cards interact, it can be tough. I'm four hours in and I still mess up interactions. Each enemy also has its own deck, so there's lots to learn. It feels like the game was made by a competent team who has deeply played other deckbuilders. It feels like the better parts of Slay the Spire and Monster Train and a little bit of Dream Quest, too.

76561197999259031,3,N/A,Recommended,"It's a good game, and compares well to Civ. I actually prefer it significantly over Civ 6 (and 5, for what it's worth.) The culture-shifting mechanic is well thought-out and leads to interesting gameplay decisions. The AI is competent. The religion side of the game is forgettable and the civics need fleshing out. But it's currently one of my favorite 4X titles at the moment, and certainly of the past five or so years. THAT SAID, it's hideously unbalanced at the moment. It's trivially easy, with even a little forethought, to enter the space age while your rival empires are fighting each other with pikes. Some cultures are significantly more powerful than others; some civics are significantly more useful than others; some units are significantly more powerful than others. And so on. With a couple of patches, this game will be incredible. As it is? Well, I got 100 fun hours out of it before I had to wait for a patch. That ain't bad. (note: I play exclusively against the AI.

76561197999259031,3,N/A,Recommended,"Three rows of brutal demon vs angel combat. The deckbuilding layer is comprehensive and lends itself to interesting inter-faction combos and some solid long-term decision making. The strategic side is tight and well-designed, with crisp animations of your demons crushing their angelic enemies (hopefully). The overmap is well-designed: you can see ahead of you an infinite amount so if you're into planning (I am not) then you can map out your every move. All of your rewards are randomized, so typically you really just need to pick left or right path, and you gain the three little perks of that side. It ties together seamlessly, and I want to have a special HUGE SHOUTOUT to the world design team and the writers. The world is always in the background, told through flavor text on enemies, artifacts, and items. Most things, really. Everybody's got a little backstory, and it ties together beautifully. The world feels alive and vibrant in a way that you don't often see in video games. The Melting Remnant is my favorite- a faction of candle-folks who melt away and are reborn again. The cards depict a society that's rough but hopeful, equal parts oppressed and oppressive. Anyways, it's a hell of a game.

76561197999259031,3,N/A,Recommended,"Horror-themed hide and seek. It took a couple hours for it to 'click' for me, but after four or five I was able to win a couple of rounds. Important point- you can do well (and rank up) even if you don't 'win-' the game keeps track of a couple of metrics, and judges you based on that. The matchmaking is usually pretty good, at least at the lower-mid ranks. The perk system gives you a lot of customization, although it's not very well balanced. Some perks are almost mandatory and some perks are completely worthless. The worst part is that some perks are behind a literal paywall- pay a couple of bucks to unlock the killer/survivor with the perks you want, then level them up to 30 (couple of hours worth) and then you can have their perks on anybody you want. But you can't unlock some of the cast without paying actual literal money. So that's something you should look out for. But you can unlock most of the cast with the currency you (slowly) get from gaining player levels, which you get by spending the blood points you earn at each match and leveling up your characters. Anyways, it's fun. Being a survivor means running through windows and hiding in grass and getting spooked by big nasty boys. Playing killer means running through foggy nightmare landscapes and beating people with hammers and hoping they die. They're both about equally fun. Sometimes it's frustrating when people just BM you, but that's online play for you. You get used to it. Most people are fine. The game encourages a certain style of play, and so that's what people tend to do. I bought it on sale but it's worth full price, in my opinion. There's a lot more depth to the game than it might seem at first. Watching it doesn't do it justice.

76561197999259031,3,N/A,Recommended,"Brutal singleplayer deckbuilder with a unique and beautiful art style. It's really its own beast- it doesn't play like your typical deckbuilder, but has its own ebb and flow that I find very satisfying. Here's the basic game flow- you start with a handful of food and wood, and a couple survivors. You use your survivors to gain more resources, which you'll need to gain idea cards and to pass the area. Ideas are extremely useful and give you better access to resources, thin your deck, or remove negative cards. On the other hand, you only have a limited amount of time total to bypass a certain number of areas, so you can't usually dawdle around and just build a lot of ideas. But if you don't build enough ideas, then you'll be doomed when a particularly difficult area arises. Each area also has an encounter- sometimes friendly, sometimes not. Not all encounters are difficult, but they always throw a wrinkle in your plan. You're always pushed forwards, but additional ideas are unlocked for each turn you stay in an area. It's often a difficult decision- do I stall for a turn or two to gain an excellent card, or do I forge onwards and hope it doesn't matter? The right choice isn't always obvious for a couple of areas, so learning what sorts of threats are likely to be ahead of you matters. Additionally, more interesting cards and obstacles and areas are unlocked as you play.

Enemy minotaurs (and, eventually, other creatures) come in from the sides of the board to kill your stones and claim the victory point locations for themselves. Kill them and they'll respawn. An individual round only takes a couple of minutes, and if you win enough, it gets harder- more minotaurs and more score required to clear the board.

You take turns drafting cards to build an empire and then, when all 8 slots are filled for the turn, you squabble for neutral settlements, wage war on each other directly, and then score points based on the cultural value of what you've built. Since you can never know what cards are going to be available for you to draft, you have to carefully balance your economy, unit types, war capability, and cultural value. The end result is an engrossing card drafting duel game that has massive replayability and plenty of opportunities for inventive strategies. I highly recommend it.
