Управляешь небольшим отрядом наемников в стране третьего мира [spoiler]где-то в латинской америке.[/spoiler]
Участвуешь в войне против тираничной королевы Дейдраны.
Атакуешь регулярные войска, захватываешь города, шахты и другие важные объекты.
Итоговая цель - свергнуть тиранический режим королевы, и вернуть трон страны ее мужу (который вас и нанял для этой цели).
Сюжет прямой как палка, но от этого игра не становится плохой.
Ведь как говорил великий и ужасный Джон Кармак:
""Сюжет в компьютерной игре как сюжет в порно. Он должен быть, но он совершенно не важен""

П.С.Если игра покажется вам слишком легкой даже на высокой сложности, установите фанатский мод Wildfire. Там уровень хардкора выкручен на максимум. | I played many TRPGs, but this is the one I always come back to, because its simply the best one with right mods. For two decades the 1.13 mod is in development, adding tremendous amount of features, aiming to make the game as realistic a possible. If you dont mind sprite graphics and ready to spend some time learning the numerous features, hotkeys and mechanics you'll find out that it has an almost infinite replayability. The mods I use are 1.13 (latest from github repo) + Wildfire Map Pack for 1.13, plus some tweaks in the config (comes with neat app).
You get quite big campaign map, where you are free to do whatever you want, with just your end goal set - killing the tyrant. How you approach this is entirely up to you. Train your mercs, train militia, set up ambushes, do espionage, or night operations, or even raise squads from locals to help you fight or lay siege to enemy strongholds. The tyrant also doesnt sit idly - royal forces respond to your actions dynamically, actively trying to stop you. The 1.13 has numerous optional features too, for any flavor of 80's movie you want to achieve.
The combat is really thought out, and numerous tactical maneuvers you can do. Overall, recommend. | Old school, maar nog steeds een geweldig spel | Endlessly entertaining!"

Во-первых она интересная, но уж слишком короткая. В отличие от оригинала тут она очень насыщена что несомненно плюс. Однако в ней есть то, что положило начала всем моддерам этой игры - редактор карт и кампаний. Теперь можно создать свою кампанию (Кроме самой первой локации - она неизменяема), можно и импортировать своего героя из предыдущей JA2, однако делать это нужно с осторожностью - сложность повышается немыслимо. Да в самой игре будут некоторые изменения. Кстати, кроме героя и будут прокачаны или мертвы те наёмники которые были в сохранении. Так что можно начать и с крутым героем и с крутыми наёмниками, но повстанцев там нет - это нужно учитывать. Несколько изменился движок - графика стала получше, ИИ позлее. Рекомендую к ознакомлению."

Queria eu fazer uma análise sincera sobre esse jogo, mas não há necessidade, esse jogo dispensa qualquer elogio, um jogo a frente de seu tempo, criativo, divertido, com uma das melhores vilãs que já vi, isso só ouvindo sua voz.

Still Alive, esse jogo é GOAT e sempre será. | jogar portal é igual chupar priquito, você não sabe oq tá fazendo, mas se sente muito bem depois de chegar onde quer. 😂 | Que jogão!

76561198192893105,15210,Silent Hunter® III,2.9833333333333334,Simulation,0,"There's a reason this game is at or near the top of the charts for Submarine games - even after 20 years. In short, it's damn near perfect. But I'll be honest - if you like instant gratification, guns-a-blazing action then look elsewhere. This game relies on planning and stealth. You may spend hours stalking your prey for that perfect kill. And much like the real-life events it portrays, you will slowly turn from the ""hunter"" into the ""hunted"" as the allies slowly figure things out and improve their weapons and tactics. Enjoy the 1st and 2nd ""Happy Times"" while they last. Like a real U-boat commander, there's a 70-80% chance that you won't survive the war. A remarkable game that has stood the test of time. | Now 20 years old but still immersive. It's faults are well known but tolerable. One piece of advice is to save the game periodically, particularly if on a long ocean transit, and after any successful action. Otherwise you may lose a considerable amount of game time. Often find if you really zoom in on the navigation chart when  conducting a detailed action, plenty of plots and updates, the program can bug out then. So again, in such cases in pays to save so you are not wasting a lot of careful work. Stuck to playing the vanilla version but plenty of advice on that and the modded versions on SubSim and other forums, plenty of good info amongst the sometimes rubbish. | the game is quite old, butthe mechanics are good | jeu incroyable, jouez y, il est vieux, il a 4 mois de plus que mois étant sorti en mars 2005 mais il reste relativement propre et les suisvants sont moins biens | I want to buy silenthunter3 for my ipad.

 | The game also comes with a DLC, which includes the following items:

1. A Toxic Community: Mistakes are rarely forgiven. Unless you’re playing with friends, be prepared to face harsh criticism, often from younger players. The game’s multiplayer is largely populated by school-aged players who don’t hold back.


2. Disruptive Adults: It’s not just the kids causing chaos—some adults blast music through their microphones, assuming everyone else shares their taste. Spoiler: they don’t.


3. Frequent AFKs: Teamwork can fall apart when a teammate goes inactive, whether they’re brewing tea, taking a smoke break, or simply wandering off mid-game. And yes, it often happens right after you’ve generously used your first aid kit on them.


4. Team Abandonment: Lone wolves running off to the far corners of the map, only to be overwhelmed by infected, are a common sight. They’re quick to flood the chat with colorful language before rage-quitting the game.


5. Difficulty Disputes: Some players join games on ""Expert"" difficulty only to demand a downgrade. If their request is denied, they might sabotage the team before leaving the server entirely.


6. Vote Kicks: Occasionally, you’ll encounter players who inexplicably start a vote to kick you from the game. When you ask why? Crickets.



The Verdict: Despite the chaotic community, Left 4 Dead 2 remains a phenomenal experience. The graphics are a significant step up from the first game, the mechanics feel more polished, and there’s a greater variety of weapons and infected to enjoy. However, surviving the online experience without a calming remedy might be just as challenging as surviving the zombie apocalypse itself. | [h1]写了800字的推荐文，手欠点了一下""否""全没了。不说了血压高了,头晕。[/h1]总之就是《关于一个萌新GMOD玩久了无聊直接去玩L4D1多人因太菜反复被僵尸虐而被队友抛弃伤心自责卸载游戏过半年好奇进L4D2知道玩单人熟悉官图及玩法过程中发现了能打MOD结果一发不可收拾地搜各种进阶攻略教程提升自己游戏体验和能力努力不坑队友可仍然很菜但是很感谢带萌新入坑的朋友们以及创意工坊的大佬们给这游戏第二次生命的事》 | Крутая игра для игры с друзьями (которые в это не играют)! Есть редкие достижения, куча пушек и толпа зомби, которая будет медленно наступать на пятки и их съедать. В общем, весело, рекомендую. | Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D2), released by Valve in 2009, is the gold standard for cooperative zombie shooters. Featuring intense survival gameplay, smart AI, and an incredible atmosphere, L4D2 delivers an unmatched multiplayer experience. With its fast-paced action, diverse weapons, and unpredictable enemy encounters, this game remains one of the most thrilling and replayable co-op shooters ever made.

Gameplay – Pure, Adrenaline-Fueled Action
L4D2 is all about co-op survival. You and three teammates must fight through hordes of the undead, navigating through various maps and completing objectives to reach safety. The key to survival? Teamwork, strategy, and adaptability.

The gunplay is tight and satisfying, with a wide selection of weapons including assault rifles, shotguns, SMGs, sniper rifles, and melee weapons like axes, katanas, and even frying pans! Every encounter feels dynamic, thanks to the AI Director, which adjusts the difficulty based on your team’s performance, ensuring no two playthroughs are ever the same.

Special Infected – Enemies That Keep You on Edge
Beyond the standard zombie horde, L4D2 introduces Special Infected that force players to work together:

Tank – A massive brute that can throw debris and crush survivors.
Witch – A terrifying enemy that, if startled, can instantly incapacitate a survivor.
Smoker – Uses a long tongue to drag players away from their team.
Hunter – A fast, agile infected that pounces on survivors and pins them down.
Boomer – Explodes in a shower of bile, attracting a massive horde.
Charger – Charges through groups, slamming a survivor into the ground.
Spitter – Creates pools of acid that deal heavy damage.
Each Special Infected forces different team strategies, making communication and positioning absolutely crucial.

Campaigns & Maps – A Horror Movie Experience
L4D2 features multiple campaigns, each set in diverse, apocalyptic locations across the southern U.S.:

Dead Center – A chaotic mall escape reminiscent of classic zombie films.
The Parish – A tense race across New Orleans to reach an evacuation zone.
Swamp Fever – A creepy, foggy swamp filled with infected dangers.
Hard Rain – A unique campaign featuring a devastating hurricane that changes the environment.
Dark Carnival – A fan-favorite, featuring a deadly amusement park with a thrilling rollercoaster finale.
Each campaign feels like a mini zombie movie, packed with cinematic set pieces, interactive environments, and intense finales.

Multiplayer & Game Modes – Endless Replayability
L4D2 offers several game modes that keep the action fresh:

Campaign Mode – Classic co-op survival through story-driven levels.
Versus Mode – One team plays as survivors, while the other controls the Special Infected.
Survival Mode – See how long you can last against endless waves of zombies.
Scavenge Mode – A competitive mode where teams race to collect fuel cans while being hunted.
Mutation Mode – Weekly game modifiers that add fun twists to gameplay.
Thanks to modding support and the Steam Workshop, the community has also created hundreds of custom maps, weapons, and campaigns, making L4D2’s replayability practically infinite.

Graphics & Sound – Immersive and Timeless
Even years after release, L4D2’s atmospheric lighting, detailed environments, and gruesome effects hold up well. Zombies react realistically to gunfire, and the sound design is masterful, with eerie background noises, terrifying growls from Special Infected, and intense musical cues that heighten the suspense.

The voice acting and character interactions bring the survivors to life, making them memorable and adding humor to the chaos.

Why Left 4 Dead 2 is a Must-Play
L4D2 is the perfect blend of action, horror, and co-op gameplay. Whether you’re playing with friends or AI teammates, the intense combat, unpredictable enemy encounters, and endless replayability make every match a thrilling adventure.

🔹 Final Rating: 10/10
Left 4 Dead 2 is a masterpiece of cooperative gaming. If you love zombies, action, and teamwork, this is an absolute must-play that still delivers endless fun and excitement after more than a decade.

76561198192893105,32440,LEGO® Star Wars™ - The Complete Saga,2.05,Adventure,0,"This is unequivocally the best Lego game ever made. 
The combat and graphics in this game are detailed
and makes the game one to revisit for years to come
10/10 game | The first real game I ever played was LEGO® Star Wars™ - The Complete Saga, excluding Flash games. Honestly, it's a masterpiece in every way. The comedy, charm, and creativity make this an unforgettable experience. Also, after playing LEGO® Star Wars™: The Skywalker Saga, I found it surprising that you cannot design your own Jedi or Sith even though it is a newer game. Instead, you're trapped with a predetermined cast of characters. However, in The Complete Saga, you can create your own personalized characters by mixing and matching pieces as desired. That increased freedom is why The Complete Saga is the GOAT. It allows you to actually play out your own Star Wars experience in a way that the newer game just doesn’t. 10/10 | It's all a bit old, and the multiplayer isn't properly implemented for that, but it's a classic for a reason. Solid entertainment with lots of fun bits to explore. | Could be on a top 10 list for the greatest video games of all time. Perhaps is the greatest LEGO video game of all time. Not many games can stand the test of time like this one has, with a near perfect reception record. Thank you for this beautiful gift you have so graciously given us, developers. | Lego Star Wars the Complete Saga is The GOAT of Lego games.  All other opinions are wrong!  Thank you and have a good day."

I beat this game on PC years ago, no major issues. Just finished 100%ing the game on my Switch today, so I thought I'd drop a review in for this version.
Only thing I'll say is get the stud multiplier red bricks before you even bother with the True Wizard gold bricks and don't be afraid to look things up as your draw towards your final collectables. No shame in losing track.
I kinda miss this style of Lego game now that the few we get are all full dialogue and kinda overproduced. | Uno de los juegos de Lego más notablemente anti-cooperativos que jugué; un despropósito absoluto, incapaz siquiera de apelar al fanático empedernido de Harry Potter."

First of all, there are occasional crashes. Emphasis on occasional; I don't get too many. But they do happen.

Second, it is IMPERATIVE that you turn on VSync in the options. Otherwise, Tech Suit Robin's car CANNOT go up slopes and you will be softlocked. So go into options, highlight the Vsync option, and move the arrow keys/control stick to the left/right. (Yes, it's a weird control option.)

Once you do that, though, you should be home free! I do recommend playing this with controller, but it is playable on keyboard. | childhood game, my beloved <3

very sick to rediscover this game! Finally finished the level i was stuck on (baby me could NOT figure out how to get past the first level T^T). I felt so stupid and frustrated back then because I couldn't figure out how to continue,,,, Well, you know what time did? Absolutely nothing, lol. I still get confused, sometimes HAHA :p I guess some things never change. 

Anywho! Epic game and very nice to play when you dont want to stress too much :> | I love this game on other platforms, but here it's heavily bugged that impedes my progress. When my character is standing on a pressure plate or jumping platform, it bugs out and prevents me from jumping. (Leaving me to failing jumps over and over again.) And there are sections where vehicles can't go upstairs like the final level in the villain penguin campaign. The game requires you to drive up the main entrance of the arctic building to smash an ice wall the enter. But the car just stays stuck at the base.

Until the bugs get fixed, I say people play the console versions of this game. | Even though I never had this game growing up unlike Lego Star Wars The Complete Saga and Lego Indiana Jones The Original Adventures, I still had an absolute blast playing through this game. Getting to play it from not only the hero's perspective, but the villain's perspective as well is a genius concept that I really wished more Lego games tried this concept. I definitely recommend this game for those getting into the Lego games. | Totalmente recomendado. Es una joya para re-jugar mas de una vez, ya que tiene muchísimo contenido. Posiblemente el mejor o de los mejores juegos de lego."

Great gameplay, with an inspiring and motivating soundtrack to keep you trudging through real headscratching puzzles. The soundtrack itself is great to play while doing programming or very mentally intensive work.

The fishcake is yummy. | This has been an insane challenge but super fair, with minor exceptions*. If you like this sort of thing, this is EXACTLY the sort of thing you'll like.

Thank you, Zachtronics, for making such an amazing game. This is not a Sudoku or Sokoban where there is exactly one perfectly-logical solution to each puzzle. Instead, each player invents their own solutions -- and some can be more efficient than others, in multiple mutually-exclusive ways. As Zach Barth said in old interviews, SpaceChem is an example of ""design-based games, which present you with a goal, perfect information, and a set of combinable tools to achieve it... they're essentially asking you to 'invent' a solution to a problem instead of merely 'finding' the solution."" This kind of creative puzzle-solving is what I had imagined a STEM PhD program would be like (though it turns out PhDs are not really mostly about this; but that's a whole other story).

And... after a decade and a half, HOLY COW I finally beat it! Without hints**! I know many others have beat it before me, but it's still satisfying to know I've done something SpaceChem's designer Zach Barth has (according to old interviews) never done himself.

WOW has this ever been a long journey. These little molecules and waldos have accompanied me like a white whale through so many life stages. When SpaceChem came out in 2011, I started playing the game and enjoyed it a ton, but I got stuck and took a break. A few years later, I picked it up again as a distraction from grad school, but only reached the 4th or 5th world out of 9 -- before taking another (loooong) break. A decade later, after getting tenure, my treat to myself was to tackle SpaceChem seriously again... and now it's finally done -- with my kids staying up late to cheer as we beat the final boss.

Looking at the Steam-friends leaderboards, I'm also amused to see where my friends apparently quit playing. The quantum-physics PhD tunneled out in the 3rd world; the Twitch data scientist stopped streaming in the 5th; the software engineer and the IT manager suffered packet loss in the 6th. Somehow, I alone persevered to traverse the desolate worlds 7 through 9. Steam says I've spent 60ish hours on the game; I'd guess around 30 hours covered the first 6 worlds and the other 30 hours covered the last 3 worlds. Many of my solutions aren't optimized and beautiful (especially Don't Fear The Reaper; holy crap I made an ugly mess there) -- but they are mine, my own inventions, my hard-fought victories.

Once again, thank you to Zach and Zachtronics.

* The minor exceptions to fairness: (1) Every non-boss level tells you exactly how many molecules you need to make, but the boss-levels don't. It can be orders of magnitude harder to devise a solution that'll use up all molecules equally and produce an unending stream of hits, vs a good-enough solution that's unbalanced but just enough to beat the boss... yet you don't know how many hits each boss will take until you beat it. Most take around 3 hits -- but not all. (2) The game doesn't seem to allow multiple save slots for a level. If I try one solution and it doesn't QUITE work and I want to try another one, I have to get rid of my first solution and start the second... and if the second fails, I can't revert back to the first. I could take a screenshot of an initial solution, then remake it from scratch later if I need to, but aaargh! This is a small but extremely frustrating flaw in the game's interaction design. HOWEVER, I didn't realize until after beating the game that there's a dev-authorized ""community edition"" beta version which DOES allow multiple save slots per level. Look it up. Argh.

** ""I beat it, without hints"": Ok, technically, for the very last 2 boss levels I eventually looked up how many hits it takes to defeat each boss. See above -- I think this is unfair imperfect information. Besides, all the earlier bosses die after around 3 hits, but these two didn't die after 3... nor after 4... so I gave in and looked it up, because there's a big difference between ""incrementally tweak my initial solution to stretch from 3 hits to 5 or 6 hits"" vs ""start again from scratch to allow for 10 or 20 or 40 hits."" But I didn't look at anyone else's solutions, merely the number of hits required. | I'm wondering why I'm playing this game, is it any different than going to github and submitting a feature? | This is a game made for people with massive brains. | bu oyun"

差不多7年前，我的小学同学就发现了这款大作，那时手机版还没有心动，只有应用商店里的1.2版本，对于当时的我们，手机版1.2只有两个滑轮键控制移动和瞄准，并且局域网联机方便，十分益于上手。我和几个哥们一放假就聚在一起play。当时我们卡在世纪之花这个boss，就聚在学校小花园商量战术，没想到我自己直接单挑过了，还有我第一次打过肉山，是拿蜜蜂手雷和它同归于尽，真的很怀念1.2陪伴我的时光，之后1.2下架，国服代理，为了玩上1.3的泰拉，我在好游快爆苦苦地种玉米（当时可以以此换取游玩资格，否则就要花钱），没想到最后发现还需要早起抢购资格，而我当时可能在上学，没有抢到，努力直接白费。我和同学只能在网上寻找那些还没下架1.2的网站继续玩。
从小学到了初中，以前玩泰拉的朋友各奔东西，但我对泰拉的热情依然不减，后来出了手游国际版我便立即下载，顶着看不懂的英文，摸索1.3的机制，专家模式掉落的装备我都从未见过，新鲜感和好奇心油然而生，初中期间我也找到了一两个一起玩的，使我不至于太孤独。疫情之前，我从来都是只玩手机版泰拉，知道疫情上网课，我终于有机会玩上电脑版了。当时的我对电脑并不精通，也不知道steam是什么东西，于是就在360浏览器直接搜泰拉瑞亚，经过一天的寻找，我也是下到了盗版泰拉（当时我也不知道正版要买）就这么在电脑上再通关了一遍普通模式，但这次没有任何人陪伴，只有我一个人。
终于到了高中，我了解了正规的steam渠道，在打折期间花18块钱买了正版泰拉，为童年补了票，高二认识了几个志同道合的同学，一起玩了灾厄，也是乐在其中。如今，我即将成人，步入大学生活，但我的泰拉之旅还在继续，玩了十几年游戏，只有泰拉瑞亚给我的印象最深，给我带来的乐趣最多，对于陪伴了我78年的老伙计，打多少星已经不重要了，真没想到我能写这么多，回顾了一遍我的童年，我的眼里有些模糊。 | --{ Gráficos }---

Люблю эту игру | The game is fabulous, but a bit more handholding at the very beginning would be nice, because the moment the game started, I had no idea what I was supposed to do or how I was supposed to build anything or use my inventory, so the first few minutes were horrendous, and I was dying quite a lot, which reminded me why I instantly deleted this game many years ago when trying to play it for the very first time. This time around I decided to keep at it, and the first 10–15 hours were slow, but then I got the hang of it, and the game consumed me to the point where I lost track of time and racked up 100 hours just completing the main story and hunting for some achievements.

The traders here are richest people in the world because they sell things for some unrealistic prices, but you sell them for pennies, and it doesn't matter if it's trash or one of the best armor in the game. You really have to grind(kill monsters and sell them for nothing) if you WANT to buy recipes and craft armor set that appears on higher difficulty in each act. I only lasted for two acts. Not for me

Absolutely broken. Set traps for a few seconds [i]during[/i] combat? Traps that Geralt should set before combat? Yes. Enemies block your attacks without block animation? Yes. Enemies ignore your attacks and continue their attack animation and kill you? Yes. CD in one of the updates disabled health regen during Quen, thinking that it was better? YES. Bad QTE? Yes. Bombs and knives are OP? Yes. I wouldn't say that these problems greatly affect the gameplay and perception of the game, but the fact that they exist is annoying. The combat system in The Witcher 1 was much better

[b][h2]9/10[/h2] | ""The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings"" is a critically acclaimed RPG that builds upon the strong foundation laid by its predecessor, offering a deeper, more refined experience. Released in 2011 by CD Projekt Red, the game is set in a dark and gritty world full of political intrigue, moral ambiguity, and complex characters. It follows Geralt of Rivia, a skilled monster hunter, as he becomes entangled in a conspiracy involving the assassination of kings and the fate of the entire continent. The game’s story is rich and engaging, with choices that truly matter, allowing players to shape the narrative in meaningful ways.

One of the most striking features of ""The Witcher 2"" is its branching storyline. The game offers multiple paths depending on the choices players make, particularly during key moments. This results in different quests, character interactions, and even entire endings. The world feels alive and reactive, and the player’s decisions carry weight, making each playthrough potentially unique. This level of player agency is one of the game’s greatest strengths, as it provides a deep sense of involvement in the unfolding drama.

The combat in ""The Witcher 2"" is fast-paced and strategic. Unlike many RPGs that rely heavily on simple hack-and-slash mechanics, this game requires players to think tactically. Geralt uses a combination of swords, magic, and alchemy to defeat his enemies, and mastering each of these elements is key to surviving tougher battles. The game also features challenging boss fights that demand careful planning and quick reflexes. While it can be difficult at times, the combat feels rewarding, and successfully defeating a tough opponent provides a real sense of accomplishment.

The world-building in ""The Witcher 2"" is exceptional. The game’s settings are varied, from war-torn battlefields to lush forests, crumbling castles, and bustling cities. Each area feels unique, with its own culture, history, and lore. The attention to detail is remarkable, and the game does an excellent job of immersing players in its world. The character design is similarly impressive, with a cast of memorable individuals that are morally complex and believable. The game’s voice acting, writing, and character development all contribute to making the world feel lived-in and full of depth.

Another standout aspect of ""The Witcher 2"" is its mature and morally gray storytelling. The game doesn’t offer simple good-versus-evil narratives; instead, it explores themes of power, betrayal, and the consequences of one's actions. Many of the choices players face are morally ambiguous, and there’s no clear ""right"" or ""wrong"" answer. This makes the game feel more grounded in reality, where actions often have unintended consequences, and characters are rarely just one-dimensional.

While the game’s graphics were impressive for its time, it’s the overall atmosphere and attention to detail that truly stand out. The soundtrack enhances the experience, with a score that captures the tone of the game perfectly, whether it’s a haunting melody during a quiet moment or a fast-paced theme during combat.

""The Witcher 2"" is a game that appeals to players who enjoy a more mature and complex narrative. Its story, world-building, and choice-driven gameplay make it one of the best RPGs of its generation. It’s a game that rewards exploration and thoughtful decision-making, and it challenges players to consider the deeper consequences of their actions. With its engaging combat, morally complex characters, and immersive world, ""The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings"" remains a standout title in the RPG genre.

 | Witcher serisinin üzerine yapışmış saçma bir algı var ""1. ve 2. oyun çöp. Direk 3. oyunu oynayın."" diye. Hadi 1. oyunun mekaniklerini beceremeyip bu eleştiriyi yaptınız (ki ilk oyun da harikadır benim için) da arkadaş bu güzelim oyunu niye araya kaynatıyorsunuz? Son derece keyifli, hikayesi sürükleyici, grafikleri bugünden bakınca bile etkileyici bir yapım. Oynayın, oynatın. | Most people said that TW3: Wild Hunt is more enjoyable if you've played the first two games first. After doing so, that most certainly isn't the case. These felt kind of like a waste of time overall, I'd say you're good just playing the third if you're unsure of where to start. 

The main reason I went back and played the first two Witcher games was because I started a playthrough of TW3 and felt like I was so behind on the lore and characters of the universe. I kept encountering characters that the journal said Geralt had met in previous adventures until finally I decided to cut my losses 50+ hrs in and complete the first two games first before returning. 

But both stories in the first games are fairly inconsequential. TW1 is definitely unnecessary, only giving you a glimpse of who Geralt and a few of his closest friends are while pursuing a criminal organization. TW2 shows the political state of the kingdoms just before the third game, and some brief flashbacks into Geralt's forgotten past before his amnesia, but that's it. 

None of the characters I'd thought were in the first games like Ciri, Yennefer, Keira Metz, Sigismund Dijkstra, the two people burning at the stake in a certain city that the journal says Geralt knew, etc, are even in them. Okay, maybe one of the people burning at the stake is at least in TW2 but they were just a merchant near the end of the game with one line of dialogue, at least in my playthrough. They had no role in the story at all. I'm left to assume most of the story I thought I missed out on is in the books, not the earlier games.

So I gained nothing from playing this. On top of that the games were kind of boring. Dialogue was decent but even compared to the first game TW2 was disappointing. TW1 impressed me more in some ways. 

The quests felt more involved in TW1, where simply following what we were being directed to do in the journal could lead to screwing ourselves over. I often had to think, and pay attention to what someone said earlier for a clue on how to properly move forward. Nearly every time I made progress during a quest, I could chat with a character I knew who would have new dialogue for me, unlike TW2. Sometimes we could talk to a character other than the one on our objectives for a better outcome. Here everything is just straightforward, follow the next objective, no thinking required. 

Romances in TW1 felt more rewarding and the opportunities were much more numerous. I didn't even pursue them and ran into quite a few. It felt like a mini-game of its own since there were romance cards to collect. Looting also felt more important, whereas in TW2 we just get a bunch of crafting items/herbs I never even used. Most of it I just sold since I had so much with no use for it. And not being able to select the loot individually felt dumbed-down. Potions felt ineffective in TW2 and having to predict when I might need them was annoying since we could only consume them while meditating, so luckily they could be largely ignored on ""Normal"" difficulty. 

I could describe a bunch of other things that TW1 did better, but also some things in TW2 just weren't as much of a step forward as I'd expected. There weren't many choices I made in the game that I felt made a difference later down the line. The game failed to introduce a sufficient number of interesting characters throughout the story; there are very few worth remembering. Contracts were also very scarce and simplistic. The monster variety was severely lacking, mostly just Nekkers, Endregas, Harpies, and occasional Rotfiends. Gear still felt minimalistic in that it wasn't impressive-looking and there wasn't much to be found in the entire game. The variety in areas the game takes you to isn't there either, it's just 3 different locations all of which are boring: a swamp outpost, a muddy camp, and some old ruins. The game basically all happens in settlements, like the first game.

Also TW2 is a short game, only 36 hours and I took my sweet time + read all the journal/character/location/monster entries.  It's really only better than the TW1 in graphics and combat, and the TW1 wasn't a great game either. 

Both of these are like a 7/10 for me. Enjoyable enough to make it through one full playthrough, but I've no desire to ever play them again. Hopefully TW3 actually lives up to the hype, and I'll at least have some characters appear in it which will help make the time spent here worthwhile when I import my save to it.

Es la aventura épica, la gran odisea de un valeroso bardo en busca de ... PONERLA, sí, y con la más rankeada del barrio ^^ | Fantastic game, a truly hidden gem. Voice acting, jokes and songs are the highlight, but the gameplay itself is really solid too. Its still smooth and responsive and gives a lot of fun. | This game has aged very poorly so keep that in mind if you plan to play it. 

First the good. The story, world, and characters are still really good, some of the humor may not stand the test of time for some folks but overall, I found the humor to landed more the missed. The bard as a character is also a huge POS so if you like playing more traditional heroes you might not like him as much, though Karma almost always hits back at the bard in all his encounters.

Then the bad, sorry to say the worst part of the Bard's Tale is the gameplay though. This is one of the worse controlled action RPGs I've really played and least variety in terms of combat. 

First every map has you fight the same two to three enemy types over and over. Their models may change but their tactics largely don't with typically One ranged type and one melee type and rarely a healing enemy. Melee only goal is to surround you and they can stun lock you very easy if they succeed, ranged enemies barely matter, and healing are annoying as they constantly run away. You fight so many of these groups over and over with increasing numbers to the point you'd have to cheese them from afar as you can attack them off screen with a bow and they'll do nothing.

Second your combat capabilities are very limited. You have a melee attack that is almost always blocked if you attack from the front against any melee enemy. A ranged weapon that takes so long to fire that if enemies are charging at you and get maybe one to two shots before they reach you if you don't attack while they are off screen in which case congrats you found the strategy to slowly and boringly win every fight. Summons who are either too weak to be helpful getting off one-two attacks maybe before immediately dying, are too utility based to do anything meaningful, or simply don't work as advertised 70% of the time. Grab the tank minion only for enemies to still prioritize you, grab the mercenary to attack only to suffer the same fate as the player when swarmed by melee enemies and immediately dying, grab the summon to remove traps only for him to stupidly run towards enemies and die, etc. and etc.

If you do want to try this just play on the easiest setting for the story because I can pretty much guarantee the combat and gameplay aspects of this title will wear down any played who was just mildly interested in a new RPG. | A mostly competent early ARPG. Fun enough, despite some rough patches, and while it does show its age when it comes to the menus and options, even as a remastered version, it still holds up well enough to play.  The voice work is good, the songs are decent, but there is a strange lack of music overall. | I really tried, but lack of QoL plus the camera height made it too difficult, I'm afraid.
Sucks because it seems like a really funny Cary Elwes role."

It straddles the line between traditional/action RTS (think WC3/SC:BW or AoE2) and 4X (Stellaris, Endless Space 2) and ultimately ends up not being terribly good on either front.
Maybe I haven't delved deep enough, apparently there are people who invest hundreds of hours into this, but I'm just not hooked after a couple of games against the AI. Pass. | It would be great if not for titans - it destroy fun and make it unplayable. 0/10 You can not turn them off. | Впервые встречаю стратегию где нет кампании, но игра, хорошая.

76561198192893105,22380,Fallout: New Vegas,2.1666666666666665,"Action, RPG",1,"This is in my opinion the best first person RPG ever made. Obsidian really knocked it out of the park with this one. The world of Fallout is one of my favorite to visit and this game has plenty to explore. Something to note is that much of this game is set in an open desert which I admit isn't super visually stimulating but there's plenty of unique spots to find within the desert and it makes finding towns and settlements that much more enjoyable but your mileage may vary. In terms of gameplay, this game does show its age in more ways than one, however I don't think this takes away from the game at all. Specifically the shooting in this game is a little janky and hard to get used to but personally I feel this adds to the experience because of V.A.T.S., the sort of auto aim mechanic in the game. Personally I don't have many issues aiming as I've gotten used to the game but for newcomers it can be a learning curve. In terms of the RPG aspect, this game passes with flying colors. You can customize your character a variety of ways and (especially without the DLC raising the level cap) it rewards you for doing multiple playthroughs by trying out different builds and perks. As for the story, there are multiple factions to engage with and the game gives you almost complete freedom on how you choose to deal with all of them. You can even reject them all and form your own path. The soundtrack is also phenominal from both the in-game radio and the overworld music. One minute you'll be listening to classic jazz and country tracks, the next you'll be listening to the creepy ambience as you explore a new cave or abandoned building. The voice acting also leaves little to be desired, with stellar performances all around for basically every character in the game. You will find that many characters sound quite similar, with voices like Liam O'brien and Yuri Lowenthal being used all over the game. This might detract from your immersion but personally I think they do an excellent job with all of their roles and make most of them sound unique. The main game of Fallout New Vegas is excellent in every way I could think of and delivers on everything I want from an RPG. That being said I found the DLCs to leave a little to be desired, especially Dead Money. A fair warning for new players, if you go into a DLC area (aside from the Lonesome Road) you will not be able to return to the main game until it is finished and all of these areas are very high level. The stories of these DLCs also continue and expand on much of the story of New Vegas's base game so I would advise to play them after finishing the game for the best experience. Dead money has a great story but is very flawed. If you did not level any melee abilities before going in, you will most likely have a hard time playing catch up because the guns found here are either not good or are hard to come by. It also has a mute character who uses sign language. Cool idea, horribly implemented. Honest Hearts is some more good old fashioned New Vegas to run around in and I personally found it very enjoyable and it expands well on the main story. Old World Blues is the wackiest of the bunch by far. Many new unique weapons to find and some great quality of life upgrades for your playthrough. I didn't really care for the story, the main characters will talk at you for literally almost 20 minutes straight with nothing interesting to say other than ""funny"" fart jokes to keep you entertained. Thankfully there is an option to skip all this dialogue which I have used to great use on my many playthroughs. Finally, The Lonesome Road is a great capstone for the game. Your mileage with the story in this one may vary, but the gameplay in this new area is fantastic with many new challenging enemies and awesome areas to explore. With that being said, I do not think the DLC is mandatory to play to enjoy New Vegas to it's fullest. I think the best part of the game is the main game and I often don't even go into the DLC unless I'm doing a full run. If you've been on the fence about trying this one, or even just want a good game to play, play it. It will be worth your time and money. 10/10 | I desperately need a remaster of this game, the crashes and bugs make this unplayable at times. This game is definitely the best fallout but not the best game, the attention to detail of many small towns in the Mojave Desert is satisfying and the hundreds of things to do makes this very re-playable. But it is missing one thing, poker. | es horriblemente injugable todo esta mal, en el rendimiento es malo, se crasheea muy rapido y aveces no explica cosas
un 10/10 | The house always wins.

While the graphics didn't hold up well, that should't matter when playing a masterpiece like this.

The amount of choices and nuance is outstanding and it makes me wish Bethesda would more often let other companies have a go at IP's that they hold. 

Is it out of spite that obsidion created the best Fallout game to date that they no longer allow it? Who knows. 

But what you should know is that this is *the* fallout game to play. The courrior's style is as iconic as this game. | amazing game but steam and bethesda don't give a shit about making it actually playable sadly, can't even get past launch screen"
76561198192893105,207170,Legend of Grimrock,36.166666666666664,"Adventure, Indie, RPG",23,"Can't recommend this, and I'm almost 50 years old and played Eye of the Beholder when it came out.
It's just an extremely player hostile game, the designers seemed to think ""old school"" means ""obtuse"". It's not 1984 anymore, tell me how to play your game and let me fix character mistakes.
I got to level 3, it was a dumb gauntlet of getting attacked by spiders. As an old pro at Eye of the Beholder I knew how to loop them around and slant fights in my favor - then the designers started forcing me to fight them toe-to-toe. My guys would get poisoned and I had to take a trip back to the healing crystal...repeatedly. About the 15th time I was bored and sick of the game. I also found out I had accidently borked my characters, particularly the mage. Lame.
Bummer, I really wanted to like this. Play Dungeon Master or Eye of the Beholder instead. | I was in the mood for some dungeon crawling and this delivered. something I didn't expect is how much grimrock is a real time action game. It's a lot of fun to explore, solve puzzles, and learn the ins and outs of the combat system | I first got into the first-person dungeon crawler experience when I played Stonekeep. I know others had come out before it, but this was the one that intrigued me as a kid. I probably even have the CD somewhere.

Now Legend of Grimrock was a game that piqued my interest around the time it had first come out because it reminded me of Stonekeep. When I first tried it out, I hadn't made it far - maybe two floors - before I moved on. It wasn't because of boredom or lack of interest. It was simply a case of installing something else and never getting back around to it.

Well, I am now pleased to say that is no longer the case.

As I played the game, it brought back all the fond memories of my time on Stonekeep. I did have to change some of the control schemes to mimic that game because even though I had completed it in 2023 I was still expecting certain key presses to behave the same way.

I loved the exploration within the game. At no point did it feel tedious. There were some back-and-forth moments, but never anything that felt dragged out. Most of it was because I finished exploring a section and found a clue or key to get past an area that I had not yet gotten through. So obviously, I would travel to that section to get past it. There were a couple of times when I had to go back to a floor to retrieve an item - for example, I needed three torches to solve a puzzle and unlock a door. I merely went up a floor, grabbed the first three torches from their wall sconce, and viola, I was moving ahead again.

One element that I really liked in Legend of Grimrock but was not present in Stonekeep was the use of lighting and shadows. At the start of the game, you need to carry a torch with you if you want any hope of seeing what's in front of you. Later on, you can find other light sources that end up freeing your hands for other important things. But the light also has another use - to cast shadows. At one point, I was in an area where I was facing a wall. There was an empty space behind me and on the wall, there was a torch. I happened to be reading a note that I had found - and keep in mind, note reading; inventory checking, and map reviewing do NOT pause the game - when a skeleton walked into the space behind me. How did I know? Well, the torch on the wall behind us cast his shadow on the wall in front of me. It was an absolutely brilliant touch!

A game like this also has a ton of secrets which makes exploring even more worthwhile. Now the secrets varied from easy to how in God's name was I meant to figure that out?!

One other feature that I liked, which saved me plenty of headaches, especially during the final fight, was that I could disengage from an enemy and retreat to a safe spot to heal (and save if need be). 

I will eventually get around to Legend of Grimrock 2 (which honestly, I don't know how the game has a sequel with the way things ended). Hopefully, it will be just as good, if not better, than its predecessor.

Full Post: https://www.thealphabeticalgamer.com/post/l-is-for-legend-of-grimrock | A nice, simple, throwback dungeon crawler with excellent atmosphere, decent combat, solid but occasionally unintuitive puzzles, good treasure, and fun exploration. The strongest element of the game for me are its secrets - they are hidden everywhere, often require puzzles/careful observation to obtain, and have fantastic rewards. Easily the highlight of my playthrough was obtaining the Dismantler, a secret sword which has an entire floor dedicated to it. Just note that XP is pretty limited, which means you will likely be min-maxing your combat skills on every level up. If you want a mage in your party, fire magic is noticeably stronger than the other elements (at least from my experience) to the point that it will feel like you are handicapping yourself (and your fun) by choosing another school of magic. Also make sure to hold onto every rock you come across; they are often used for the game's puzzles. | Great old school dungeon crawler mixed with real time combat."

This is the game that was a path to BioWare glory and actual damnation. Why? Because this game was the start of their famous formula that they would use for nearly 2 decades afterwards. Be it Dragon Age or Mass Effect series. With the exception of Dragon Age II, of course. Always defeat big bad baddies, but not before we visit three or four locations to find some gimmicks in order to sway the course of war in our own way. Concluding in an epic battle all to remember.

It's actually hilarious that new BioWare games are not indistinguishable from old ones on a surface level. Until you delve deeper and see how much they differ. How much they've been stripped of all that made them exceptional in the first place. Writing, immersion, choice. Even your character's personal agenda! Imagine that! It's a great tragedy that this game is so unplayable on new versions. So people could actually experience this gem for what it is.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCuaPIonLT8 | So, im sure many would be surprised at the negative review but i honestly cant reccomend *this version* of KOTOR in good conscience, the game is good, alright if very simplified dnd combat, a fun story and a cast that while cliche is still fun to interact with, its a good rpg, far from the best but a good one that any rpg fan would reccomend.

The reason why i dont reccomend the game is because its absolutely borked on pc, at least in my experience.

-frequent crashes
-a memory leak that forces you to quit the game and relaunch every couple hours
-save file corruptions
-random issues like my characters not moving after the battle ends, forcing me to quicksave and quickload to regain movement

These type of issues were very common in my playthrough and they made the experience an absolute pain and soured my experience, an example is that while i was out in dantooine my game crashed every time i left the ruins but that was fixed by... loading the autosave? no other save files worked and i honestly dont know why it fixed itself.

I simply cant reccomend this version of KOTOR because even after installing bug fixes, patching the game to be playable at my monitors resolution (if you dont do this some cutscenes may crash your game) and many other fixes the game still crashed and the memory leak was never fixed, its too much of a hassle, play it on XBOX if you can. | 为什么我的游戏时长只有14分钟？因为当时的电脑一打开这游戏就闪退，还是初二小朋友的我完全不想折腾就跑去ipad上玩了，ipad又没法打汉化，所以我现在英语这么好都是托kotor的福hhhhh

虽说游戏比我年龄还大一点，画面确实简陋，系统略显老旧（不过依旧有相当可玩性），重制版惨遭腰斩（我恨啊啊啊啊啊啊），没有官方中文（不过有民间汉化），不过这部游戏的剧情是绝对地打在了我的星战粉好球区。光暗面不同但都非常好味的剧情，一路过关斩将直捣黄龙的王道，难度适中非常有趣的支线任务（[spoiler]Manaan当侦探的任务我真的很喜欢[/spoiler]），最终决战前那刻在游戏史上的反转，最重要的还是我那群最可爱的船员。

作为一部二十几年前的游戏，女性角色必然存在“英雄救美”剧情和性化服饰，但很多方面又非常超前。可以自选女主控，甚至有一段短短的女同感情线（[spoiler]Juhani超级可爱！[/spoiler]），有多个充满魅力的女性队友，她们不是任何人的附庸，不存在任何恋爱脑问题。

这部游戏的光暗面差分也非常有意思，后来质量效应的楷模叛逆就在某种意义上继承了这一系统。都有差分选项和剧情，黑暗面/叛逆高了都会对主角的外貌有影响（女主角黑暗面超酷啊），但kotor做得最好的一点我认为是在战斗技能上也做了差分（虽然这一点很大程度是因为星战绝地西斯的设定行了方便），所以战斗非常有趣不无聊，半即时制如果是玩过DAO的朋友一定不会陌生。

记住哥们一句话，剧透你也一样哭。 | So.... Yes, the game has some bugs, and errors, and one time I had to completely restart it because it just... froze? Yes, the graphics are not that good - I mean, just pixel art part is okay, but text was low quality, also some backgrounds. It also completely lacks options - like change window size or music volume.

But despite it all - it's a beautiful story. I enjoyed it a lot - it has funny jokes and moments, and wholesome, heartwarming parts, and very sad ones... Definitely worth playing, maybe buy on sale - full price is a bit much for amount of content.

Free Minisodes are okay, they add a bit of lore which is not needed to understand and don't add anything to main game, but if you plan on playing other games with those characters they could add some depth (I am not sure, as I didn't play them yet) | Bazı oyunlar vardır ki teknolojik gücüyle ya da görsel ihtişamıyla değil, hikâyesiyle insanı içine çeker. ""To The Moon"" benim için tam da böyle bir oyun. İlk oynadığım andan itibaren beni derinden etkileyen, kalbimin en derin köşelerine dokunan bir deneyim yaşattı.

Grafikleri ilk bakışta pek etkileyici gelmeyebilir; pikselli, eski tarz bir görsellik sunuyor. Ama işte tam burada oyunun büyüsü devreye giriyor. Grafiklerin sadeliği, hikâyenin derinliğiyle öylesine güzel bir şekilde harmanlanmış ki, bir süre sonra o görsel sadelik oyunun sıcak atmosferine katkı sağlayan bir unsur hâline geliyor. Zaten ""To The Moon"" grafikle değil, hikâyeyle var olan bir oyun.

Hikâyesine gelecek olursak, baştan sona duygusal bir yolculuk. İki bilim insanı, Sigmund Corporation’dan Dr. Rosalene ve Dr. Watts, yaşlı bir adam olan Johnny’nin son arzusunu gerçekleştirmek için onun anılarına yolculuk yapıyor. Johnny’nin dileği, Ay’a gitmek. Ama neden Ay’a gitmek istediğini bilmiyor. İşte bu sorunun cevabını bulmak ve bu dileği yerine getirmek için geçmişe gidiyoruz. Her bir anı parçası, Johnny’nin hayatına dair yeni bir katman açığa çıkarıyor ve oyuncuya çok güçlü duygular yaşatıyor.

Diyaloglar ise oyunun en güçlü yanlarından biri. Samimi, sıcak ve yer yer mizahi. Özellikle Dr. Watts’ın esprileri ile Dr. Rosalene’in ciddi tavırları arasındaki uyum o kadar güzel işlenmiş ki, bu ikiliyle daha fazla zaman geçirmek istiyorsunuz. Ancak asıl vurucu nokta, Johnny ve eşi River arasındaki ilişki. İkisinin hikâyesi, acısıyla tatlısıyla öyle derin ve gerçekçi ki, bazen size oyunu durdurup kendi hayatınızı ve ilişkilerinizi düşündürdüğü anlar oluyor. River’ın sessiz ama anlam dolu duruşu, Johnny’nin onunla olan bağını daha da anlamlı kılıyor.

Müziklerine gelecek olursak, Kan Gao’nun bestelediği o melodiler hikâyeyi daha da unutulmaz kılıyor. Müzikler, hikâyenin duygusal yoğunluğunu tamamlayan bir sanat eseri gibi.

""To The Moon"", benim için sadece bir oyun değil, bir sanat eseri. Anılar, pişmanlıklar, sevgi ve hayaller üzerine bir meditasyon gibi. Oynarken bir yandan hüzünleniyor, bir yandan da insana dair pek çok şey öğreniyorsunuz. Eğer hâlâ oynamadıysanız, bu unutulmaz yolculuğu bir an önce yaşamanızı öneririm.

 make sure to use community edition under beta in the games steam properties..... for the  community enhances editio

thank you for another steam reviewer for making me aware of the community enhances edition | Best modern X-COM game! It really feels the atmosphere of the original X-COM of the 90s: it has the same level of squad-based freedom tactics that are good and solid. It's very realistic in terms of tactics and assault. You can can plan your actions as you like and there's no limits or simplifications like in other late X-COM parodies where you can either run or gun, and if you perform shooting action then you can't move anymore. Here you can move then shoot then move again: just use your action points wisely the way you want. The game is really thrilling and is a gem for X-COM lovers. I still think that the best X-COM games are those made by MicroProse in 90s and the Xenonauts, but not the parodies of 2K that have the same name but with much simplified battle gameplay. 
Get this game and you will have 100% satisfaction! | i love the game, but hate the reapers, you see big purple bugs you run the hell the other way, get everyone on the dropship and abort the mission itll be hell. Also you will take losses in alien bases | XCOM with just enough changed to avoid copyright infringement.

That being said, it is extremely well done and delivers exactly what it promises. 

The only regular bug that I have come across is corrupted auto-saves in ""Ironman"" mode which is typical of all games that use this type of save scheme (note: regular mode allows manual saves)

Like XCOM, the games difficulty spikes quickly at the beginning, but becomes more manageable once you begin researching and producing new technologies.

The game also comes with an ""open"" version that allows and organises the use of mods (found on the games Steam community page) | Nie trzeba polecac. Poleca się samo.

11/10 can recommend | Tropico 4 is a highly entertaining economic simulation. While it’s no longer a new game and the graphics are somewhat dated, the addictive gameplay remains as strong as ever, even though the missions can be a bit repetitive at times.

[h2]Achievements[/h2]
[b]Required time:[/b] 70-100 hours
[b]Difficulty (in my opinion):[/b] 4 out of 10

Earning achievements is enjoyable despite the repetitiveness. Essentially, you’ll need to complete all the campaign missions and the Modern Times DLC missions, which will take up the majority of your time. For those who prefer shortcuts, cheats can be used to skip a few missions, saving significant time - but where’s the fun in that? Apart from that, there’s a long list of other achievements, most of which can be earned during the campaign. A bit of sandbox play is also required, along with tackling a very grindy achievement, although there are easy solutions available for that one as well. | they should kept more things from this version.

This version is very nice like if tropico 3 had baby with tropico 5 but baby keep more traits of poppa tropico 3. Yes very nice. | Tropico 4 is the pinnacle of the Tropico series. Could it be improved upon? Of course, but Tropico 5, unfortunately, did not improve upon it. In fact, Tropico 5 was far worse. I came back to Tropico 4. It oozes charm with it's wacky characters, it allows chaos by not requiring you to build roads, and the military system actually made sense. If you want to truly experience the Tropico series at its best, play Tropico, Tropico 3, and finally, Tropico 4. | An absolutely addicting game of strategy, manipulation, thinking-ahead, and improvisation. The scenarios can keep you entertained for hundreds of hours (as evidenced by my numbers, and I still have some scenarios to clear) and provide meaningful differences in every play that keeps the game feeling fresh. The humor and voice acting are top tier. Whenever you lose a scenario, it feels fair, and when you win and create a thriving city, it feels amazing."

Also arrows are effective which is nice to see in a TW game. 10/10 and then some with workshop mods. | Total War: Shogun 2 - это суровый мир самураев, династий и стратегических сражений, который сразу же захватил мое внимание. Эта игра не просто стратегия, это целая эпоха, в которой каждый выбор может изменить ход истории. 

Плюсы:
1. Сюжет игры, основанный на исторических событиях, позволяет взять на себя роль одного из кланов и вести его к власти. Это не просто борьба за территорию, но и глубокая стратегическая игра, где нужно учитывать политические интриги, дипломатические отношения и экономическое развитие. Каждый выбор имеет значение, и это придает игре особую глубину.
2. Атмосфера Японии периода Сэнгоку передана с невероятной детализацией для игры 2011 года: от красивых пейзажей до неплохо проработанных юнитов, каждый элемент создает ощущение погружения в игру.
3. Музыкальное оформление заслуживает отдельного лайка! Звуки природы, традиционная японская музыка и эпические мелодии во время сражений создают уникальную атмосферу, которая усиливает погружение в игру.
4. Огромный плюс игры в том, что какую-никакую кампанию можно проходить с другом! Это очень круто, весело и дает больше разнообразия для совместных стратегических действий.

Минусы:
1. Иногда искусственный интеллект может показаться не совсем адекватным, а некоторые элементы управления слишком топорные и требуют времени на привыкание. 
2. В некоторых моментах игра может показаться медленной, особенно в начале, когда нужно развивать экономику и строить армию (на что уходит куча времени).

Starts off nice and lowkey rather than being the typical overblown epic 'you are the chosen one' campaign. | This game is a classic. The isometric 90s gameplay based on AD&D 2e can take a bit to get used to, but it's worth it. | Классическая ролевая игра во вселенной D&D, которая, к сожалению, очень плохо состарилась, несмотря на ремастер. Сюжет оставляет желать лучшего, а дополнительные задания, за исключением тех, что были добавлены в ремастере, довольно однообразны. Сопартийцы не проявляют особого интереса к общению, а если и имеют личные квесты, то довольно скучные. Боевая система служит хорошим примером того, как классические механики D&D могут быть не очень хорошо адаптированы для компьютерных игр, а плохой искусственный интеллект лишь добавляет сложностей в управлении. Отыгрыш в игре практически отсутствует: харизма не влияет на исход событий, а попытка отыгрыша злодея приводит лишь к потере квестов и дополнительным трудностям. Также есть проблемы с локализацией — озвучка и текст часто не совпадают не только по словам, но и по смыслу, а дополнение и вовсе не переведено. В целом, играть стоит только тем, кто увлекается жанром, или тем, кто хочет познакомиться с историей ролевых игр. | Hoo boy.

I must admit that at first I didn't like the gameplay. The plot and point-and-click movement, and UI were completely fine. The not-quite turn-based combat threw me off, seeing as I played BG3 before this -- as well as Fallout 1 and 2 (which were developed by the same studio that made BG1) -- and I immensely enjoyed the  combat in those games. 

I had started out on Normal Mode, but once I switched over to Easy -- the combat became less agonizing. Leveling up and getting more HP + usable skills helped soothe my frustration.

And I must say that I don't mind older games and their clunky-ness, seeing as I adored playing FO1&2 (I admit I like them better than FO4 lol). BG1 in particular just grinded my gears.

HOWEVER, the plot was quite interesting and the party members I picked up along the way were delightful. Shout out to Dorn for being a great pack mule. The side quests were fun and rewarding. 

TL;DR: If you love an interesting story, play this game. If you can't stand old-game combat systems, run for your life. | К сожалению, Steam не позволяет ставить нейтральную оценку - игра точно не заслуживает положительного отзыва... но из уважения к бессмертной классике отрицательный отзыв оставлять все-таки не хочется.

Игру проходил на сложности ""Базовые правила"".

Даже с учетом переиздания игра очень плохо состарилась (и вопрос тут вообще не к визуалу!) и кроме безостановочных боев и блуждания по случайным лесам ничего не может предложить почти 2/3 от всего прохождения, пока Вы, собственно, в игре под названием Baldur's Gate не попадете в этот самый город, что происходит в 5 главе из 7. До этого игра представляет из себя рандомный автобаттлер, в котором Вы изредка в меню паузы можете прокинуть пару заклинаний (за отдых Вы много не заготовите, они низкого уровня, заговоров как в современной DnD у Вас нет, так что в основном даже хилые маги вынуждены танчить врагов лицом).  

Исход битвы от Вас практически не зависит (кроме баффов и распития зелий перед боем), не считая попыток пользоваться туманом войны, выводом врагов по одному и забиванию ногами толпой, после чего постараться идти за следующим. Оригинал вышел в 1998 году, а значит сохранение в ней - обязательная механика и часть игры, чуть что в бою идет не по плану, кто-то не дай Бог умер - тут же перезагружаемся, и так по кругу, пока не достигнем успеха. Фанаты ""Проклятых земель"" - неиронично ознакомьтесь!

За что игру неиронично можно похвалить - так это за правдивую передачу боевки реальной DnD (не считая бесконечных энкаунтеров, таким количеством мяса всех сортов и расцветок Вас точно не закидают в Ваших сессиях), хоть и в ускоренном формате: количество раз, когда и враги, и союзники бросают на атаку и безбожно мажут несколько раундов подряд - любо-дорого смотреть! А когда все-таки атакой попадают - то сносят копейку демеджа, если атакуете Вы, или Вы теряете поллица, если атакует враг. Аутентичность на высоте!

Больше всего выбесила даже не боевая система, а, внезапно, система репутации. По сюжету или просто в рандомный момент к Вам может подбежать NPC и сам на Вас напасть, и если Вы его убьете - тут же потеряете кучу репутации. Продвигаетесь по сюжету и Вы обязаны убрать сюжетных противников? Минус репутация. Перед Вами лежит еле живой приспешник главного злодея, который тому активно помогал и всему обучал, из-за чего тот стал тем, кем он стал? Если Вы не дай Бог решите его убить - минус репутация! В итоге я, стараясь вроде играть не как маньяк, убивающий всех подряд - к концу игры имел почти нулевую репутацию (3/15) и любое ее понижение автоматически забирало у меня из пати всех добрых персонажей, которые и так без остановки бубнят, как они мной недовольны, я что ли в этом виноват?

В общем, играйте в последний Pathfinder от Совокотов - получите в разы больше удовольствия. Там как раз наконец-то все обещанные DLC вышли."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBYxV-1eFKU | The Banner Saga: Factions revolves around the first part of the banner saga story, in which you are permanently stuck inside one area of the story, fighting battles in a bar against others in a multiplayer tactics game. This game has a ton of potential to grow, and can be very prominent as a game. However, the fact that it is not original in itself compared to the actual banner saga game, and the fact that no one is able to play the game, as there is no one to play against in this multiplayer only game, makes this game a little less than promising. I would not waste time on this until the developers work on the game to increase popularity, through advertising or working on the game's content, of which it is lacking, if at all.

76561198192893105,238260,Pinball Arcade,0.0,"Free To Play, Simulation",0,"I've been a huge pinball fan my entire life, to the point where I recently bought my own real machine. I've been playing Pinball Arcade since it first came out. I've spent an obscene amount on buying literally all the table DLC on PC and some of it on Android. I backed two of FarSight's Kickstarters to add loved but expensive tables to the collection (Star Trek: The Next Generation and Terminator 2: Judgement Day.)

So given all that, you may be asking, what's with the negative review?

Simply put, Pinball Arcade is a great place to play some of the best pinball tables ever made but due to licensing and overall poor and inconsistent design, the collection is a shadow of its former self and even when at its peak, I don't think the cost of entry was worth it for all but the most die hard fans who didn't mind spending way too much (i.e. me.)

Virtually all of FarSight Studios' catalog is what can be charitably described as ""value titles"", known to most gamers as shovelware. This is not a AAA or even AA studio, nor has it ever tried to be. After moderate success with previous pinball collections for 7th generation consoles, Pinball Arcade was a big shift in both direction and ambition, especially when you see the crazy number of platforms it's on (though thanks to their crooked publisher for the console versions, there are a lot of mismatches between them.) They wanted to bring as much of the world of pinball as possible to as many platforms as possible and they claimed, with as much authenticity as possible. I thought that was great. I didn't even mind that you had to buy the DLCs for each platform because that was less due to their greed and more due to the requirements of the license holders.

Whether or not you'll like the tables on offer is down to personal taste and that's not where my issues lie. My issues are with the myriad technical and design deficiencies that really damage the overall quality of the package and really make you question whether it's worth the asking price to buy what tables remain. Just some examples:

[list]
[*]All tables use the same physics model. It's not bad (certainly better than the ping pong ball model of Pinball FX) but it's not remotely close to the level of simulation they promise and some tables play not at all like their real life counterparts.
[*]PS2 era UI that's ugly, dated and clumsy to navigate.
[*]Huge inconsistency in table visual quality. Some tables look great, others are blurry messes not even close to the ""astonishing detail"" the Steam description promises.
[*]Same issues with table sounds. Some are good, others are much lower quality.
[*]Environment textures are ugly and low-res.
[*]Frame rate is inconsistent unless you're running hardware way more powerful than this should require.
[*]Online play (which is still listed in the menu as Beta) just says Coming Soon when you select it. It's been this way for years and presumably, will never be finished.
[*]Terrible account system that regularly doesn't work and requires you to reset your password multiple times before being able to sign in.
[*]Ugly, unintuitive leaderboard system.
[*]DirectX 11 mode that will push any GPU to its knees, while somehow looking worse.
[*]Table goals (which are tied to achievements) that occasionally don't unlock.
[*]Hasn't been updated in forever and no new tables have been announced. Most likely has been abandoned by FarSight.
[/list]

And of course, there's the fact that a huge number of Bally and Williams tables are no longer available for purchase, due to FarSight losing the license from WMS Industries. There's speculation as to whose fault that is but Williams is now in Pinball FX 3, where there are fewer tables that play worse than they do here. Don't get me wrong, there are still a lot of great tables available in Pinball Arcade but the Williams ones were definitely among the best and those are now long gone. The lack of support and new additions coincide pretty close with them losing the Williams license so needless to say, I think FarSight has decided to move on.

There is fun to be had here and if you're a pinball fanatic, you probably own this already. Despite my negative review, I continue to play this a lot and will keep doing so. But the reason I bought all this was because it was the only place to play most of these tables that I loved from my youth, not because I thought it was a good package and definitely not because I had or have confidence in FarSight Studios as a developer. Know what you're getting into before picking this up and definitely give the free table a try to see. I hope that one day, another studio can try the ""pinball preservation"" experiment that Pinball Arcade did, only with a more caring and skilled developer behind it. | Great game.  It's unfortunate that the Williams tables were pulled.  I was lucky enough to have gotten the game before that time, picked up all of them, and still play it frequently.

It's great to be able to play the machines I used to own, as well as some I have had my eye on for some time. | The UI is really as bad as other reviewers are saying. I also have this on PS4 and the older UI is much better, and the game itself is much more responsive (I enjoy it enough to buy some tables on PC during the sale). Can't recommend PC version at this time. | I loved playing this series on the PS4 and thought PC would improve the experience. Yikes! I'm stuck with a game that freezes on a regular basis. Nothing like being on a great roll, tripled the free game score on your first ball and you know you've already lined up at least three extra balls and you think this is the time I break the table - my score is going to be through the roof. As the third multi-ball madness winds down, without warning the game freezes. The table broke me and I never got to ball number 2. This is when the heartache went too far. The game freezes more often than not before I can go through three balls. | I have played many of these tables in the late 70ies and early 80ies, and I have to admit, the simulation is absolutely superb. It is also very nice, that you can buy single tables. Absolute recommendation for anyone who ever played pinball."

Gunpoint es un juego de puzzles y plataformas, pero con un enfoque más pausado, donde prima la estrategia y el sigilo. Somos Richard Conway, un espía freelance (autónomo) que por casualidad es grabado por las cámaras de seguridad en la escena de un crimen, el asesinato de Selena Delgado. La jefa de esta mujer, Melanie Rooke, se pone en contacto con nosotros para pedirnos que recuperemos la grabación donde aparece el asesino real de su empleada y amiga Selena, chantajeándonos con que de lo contrario, la policía pensará que nosotros somos el asesino. De este modo deberemos infiltrarnos en distintas instalaciones bien vigiladas para hackear diversos dispositivos y obtener información sensible. Sin embargo, poco a poco iremos adentrándonos en una red de conspiraciones mucho más profunda de lo que cabría esperar, donde se ven implicadas las grandes empresas armamentísticas del país y la policía. Por ello, diferentes personajes contactarán con nosotros para reclamar nuestros servicios o pedirnos ayuda con diversos problemas personales, siendo nuestro principal objetivo desenmascarar al verdadero asesino de Selena.

[h2]Jugabilidad / Apartado técnico[/h2]
Gunpoint nos ofrece diferentes misiones de dificultad y complejidad creciente, donde el principal objetivo suele ser colarse en instalaciones fuertemente vigiladas para hackear algún ordenador, robar objetos clave o escuchar conversaciones privadas. Para ello, nuestro espía podrá hacer uso de una gran variedad de gadgets y dispositivos de alta tecnología que harán su labor de infiltración mucho más sencilla. Por un lado, contamos con los pantalones Bullfrog, los cuales nos permiten saltar grandes distancias, noquear a nuestros enemigos o caer desde alturas sorprendentemente altas. Por otro, iremos adquiriendo nuevos aparatos que harán nuestra vida más sencilla, siendo el Crosslink el más importante. Este dispositivo introduce las mecánicas de puzzle al juego, permitiéndonos ver la instalación eléctrica del edificio y “recablear” diferentes aparatos a voluntad, como interruptores, puertas, cámaras de seguridad, lámparas, etc. En cada misión deberemos hacer uso de estas mecánicas para completar las distintas misiones que nos ofrezcan, tratando de cumplir con ciertos parámetros de sigilo, violencia, tiempo, etc., y siendo recompensados económicamente por nuestros servicios para así, hacernos con nueva tecnología.

[h2]Valoración[/h2]
Gunpoint es un juego de puzzles realmente bueno, que sabe introducir las mecánicas de acción y sigilo de una forma muy interesante. Su jugabilidad es muy dinámica, ya que primero nos obliga a observar y pensar tranquilamente cómo vamos a llevar a cabo la misión, decidiendo que aparatos recablear, qué puertas debemos tomar, la ruta de vigilancia que siguen nuestros enemigos, etc., para luego llevar nuestro plan a la acción de forma rápida y limpia, sin ser vistos ni morir en el intento. La forma de abordar cada misión puede ser diferente y creativa, dejando cierto poder de decisión al jugador para tomar distintas rutas o usar diferentes aparatos. Además, también podremos elegir entre varias opciones de diálogo con nuestros clientes, pudiendo modificar el resultado final de la historia. En resumen, un gran juego de puzzles que recomiendo probar y que ofrece entre 6-7 horas de entretenimiento.
Lo salvaría de un incendio! 👨‍🚒👍🔥

No game，no life.这绝非虚言。
小初时期在家传的旧电脑上，游玩一些可以带的动相当古早的一些游戏。在二十一世纪的第二个十年，在一系列堪称巅峰级别的大作接连发售时，我却似乎和我的电脑一起被困在了时代里。
妇孺皆知的红色警戒，彼时烂尾的大作命令与征服三发售时，我还在为兵临城下模组着迷；R星的侠盗猎车手V发售的五年后，我还在和汤米维塞迪，卡尔约翰逊一起在前3d世界观中遨游；当CS：GO已经成为现象级游戏，而此时CS1.6的人机还会卡在大仓的隧道里一动不动；至于2016年发行的文明VI六，飞天之梦响彻云霄时，我在北方的那座小城里，听着BabaYet的沙锤声，游玩着2007年发行的文明IV第四代（很巧也是四）以及跃跃欲试但在2016年仍带不动的2013发行的文明V第五代。如果说前款游戏是中国游戏界现象级的存在，而我在这个时代的最末期仍游玩的津津有味。对于文明系列，可以这样说，游戏甚至某种程度上改变了我的人生轨迹。如果我当时没有把心思放在自给自足得到的这些关注人文，关注历史的游戏上，而是去参透什么别的兴趣。也许有可能我就不会学文科，也不会选择现在的专业。
感谢某些无脑盗用游戏画面的游戏小作坊，把自己的游戏用其他游戏界面进行包装，搭便车宣传自己粗制滥造的游戏，但无巧不成书，也让我阴差阳错的知道了Paradox Interactive——一个曾经冷门，现在热度与日俱增甚至一度市值超过育碧的世界级游戏公司——以及属于他的作品们。很可惜和上述所有的游戏一致，我似乎也只“配”玩到极落后版本的游戏——这甚至也是一种奢求。不出意料的，当我尝试运作1.1版本的欧陆风云四时，电脑烧了。
这时是2020年初，拜疫情网课所赐，我终于有了一台自己的笔记本电脑，在通过各种渠道帮助下，从一位网友手中拿到了一份学习版的1.30版本的欧陆风云四。那个夏天，在烈日和暴雨下，以大明为开局，我的游戏生活第二春开始了。
但直到2023年高考结束后，我才在steam上买到正版的EU4，反倒是HOI4 21年就有了正版，那时候小黑盒还是卖兑换码的，现在早就没有了。
直到今天，2025年1月25日，本游戏严格的在线时长突破了一千小时，完成成就190个。这其中有太多的故事可以讲了，用法兰西拿破仑传播共和革命理念，用金雀花王朝重新统合大陆领地成立安茹帝国，从长白山脚下一隅到全中华的大清，从高加索群山中杀出的萨法维波斯，荣耀的哈布斯堡让Aeiou的格言传遍欧洲，摆脱鞑靼枷锁，“为了俄罗斯母亲”的莫斯科大公国，把握土木之变，重返中国的瓦剌，乃至重建蒙古帝国。令人感触最深的定是用拜占庭一隅小国绝境翻盘，重获新生，再造罗马，紫凤翱翔！感谢她给了我一个在现实中编织一个梦的机会，也让我在这个梦中徜徉，流连，不愿醒来也不愿离去。
游戏的意义和人生每件事的意义大抵都相类似，再你经历其中时，拼尽全力的达成那个目标，结束之后回头看，除了享受结果，更感慨唏嘘其过程，这便是寄意寒星荃不察，不负光阴不负心。
希望以后更好，直到时间和世界的尽头。

But honestly it's not an easy game.
You need to watch some videos how other people play it and decide if you want to throw thousands of hours on it.

76561198192893105,233250,Unknown,0.26666666666666666,,0,"Planetary Annihilation (PA) - весьма необычная, а скорее, даже уникальная в своём роде стратегия в реальном времени, полями боя в которой являются не привычные современным игрокам плоские карты, а целые луны, планеты, и даже планетарные системы. Собственно говоря, первая ""фишка"" игры заключается в сферичности карт, то есть, в отличие от классических RTS, игрок может подвергнуться нападению откуда угодно, что на корню изменяет стратегию игры. Защищаться приходится сразу со всех сторон, невозможно просто отгородиться от неприятеля стеной турелей, так как любую стену можно просто-напросто обойти. Вполне очевидно, что такое построение игрового пространства открывает игрокам огромный простор для тактических манёвров.

Вторая особенность PA - колоссальные масштабы боёв. Как говорят сами разработчики, они хотели отодвинуть микроменеджмент на второй план, так что вместо отдельных юнитов игрок управляет целыми армиями, редко состоящими менее, чем из пары сотен юнитов. Когда в таких знаковых играх как Warcraft/Starcraft игроку приходится заботиться о добром здравии каждого солдата, здесь это не нужно, да и, в общем-то, совершенно невозможно. Это отнюдь не значит, что вся стратегия сводится к построению большого количества войск, обведению их рамочкой и нажатию ПКМ на вражескую базу; такой подход, скорее всего, приведёт вас к полному уничтожению. Тут же стоит упомянуть, что, несмотря на необходимость отрисовывать сразу огромное количество боевых единиц, игра выглядит довольно симпатично; разумеется, модельки не слишком высокополигональны, да и текстуры не как в Crysis, но, благодаря великолепному дизайну, это совершенно не бросается в глаза.

Третья отличительная черта Планетарной Аннигиляции - межпланетарный и орбитальный геймплей. Как я упоминал раньше, полем боя может являться целая солнечная система из 2-5 планет каждая из которых открыта для колонизации. Выиграть битву, всю игру оставаясь на одной лишь планете, практически невозможно, ведь освоение новых земель позволяет вам в разы увеличить приток ресурсов, а также даёт вам дополнительный путь отступления в случае, если что-то вдруг пойдёт не по плану. Перемещение между планетами происходит либо с помощью орбитальных юнитов, либо с помощью порталов (которые сперва необходимо построить, а для этого также требуется либо транспорт, либо орбитальный строитель).

И, наконец, четвёртая основная особенность - это, собственно говоря, планетарная аннигиляция. Игроку позволяется уничтожать целые планеты, эффектно и мощно заканчивая игру. Вы можете построить на луне двигатели, сдвинуть её с орбиты и столкнуть с планетой, вызывая колоссальные разрушения, или же (на некоторых картах) воспользоваться Катализатором - местной вариацией Звезды Смерти. Что первый, что второй вариант требуют огромного вливания средств и времени, так что вам придётся хорошо потрудиться, чтобы осуществить один из них. Не стоит забывать, что и противник не станет сидеть сложа руки и покорно ждать своего конца; враги будут всячески мешать вам претворить свои планы в жизнь, так что будьте готовы вести боевые действия сразу на нескольких планетах.

В результате, Planetary Annihilation - это инновационная РТС, осмелюсь даже предположить, что это первая РТС следующего поколения, вводящая сразу несколько нигде ранее не виданных идей, главной из которых, на мой взгляд, являются сферические карты. Возможно, такой подход скоро станет классическим, хотя мне и не верится, что поклонники и разработчики стратегий в скором времени откажутся от привычных плоских карт... В любом случае, если вы ищете чего-нибудь нового в этом старом жанре, вам определённо стоит приглядеться к Планетарной Аннигиляции, вполне вероятно, это - именно то, что вам нужно. | Hello Commander,

Il est temps de produire un rapport dévaluation à 500 heures de jeu passées.


Concernant les aspects positifs :

-Gameplay dynamique
-Choix stratégiques multiples
-Cartes de jeu multiples à 360° 
-Simple à prendre en main
-Editeur de cartes
-Système d'équipes appréciable et original


Concernant les aspects négatifs :

-Une réalisation qui peine à avancer
-Un nombre élevé de bugs
-Un éventail de construction en jeu qui peine à évoluer
-Des fonctions techniques comme le Social ou les Lobby manquant d'optimisation


Pour synthétiser :

Un jeu prometteur aux aspects originaux dont la réalisation se fait attendre. Nul besoin d'en faire une description complète puisque certains fan sites ou encore d'autres community hubs l'ont fait. Il est important de souligner la grande originalité de ce jeu, au travers des aspects très appréciés des joueurs comme les cartes à 360°. Originalité qui ne manque pas de s'inscrire dans l'identité de Total Annihilation grâce à son style artistique et la manière dont le joueur évolue au sein des parties. Par ailleurs, l'engouement des joueurs se porte davantage sur ce qui va être réalisé que sur ce qui est déjà réalisé.

En conclusion, une communauté impatiente de découvrir un Planetary Annihilation finalisé. Un enthousiasme qui connait quelques déceptions et à juste titre. Ce sont plus de 2,000,000 $ collectés pour le lancement du jeu dont la réalisation était initialement prévue pour fin 2013. Six mois plus tard, il est consternant de constater un Lobby qui n'est toujours pas optimisé mettant à rude épreuve la patience des joueurs. Ne parlons pas des bugs connus en jeu et non résolus depuis des mois. Pour compenser tout cela les développeurs ont implanté ""The Galactic War Single Player"" ce qu'ils appellent une ""Big Rock feature"". Mais on ne remplace pas le sel par le poivre, surtout que la Galactic War ne propose qu'une évolution linéaire et monotone de votre conquête : déplacement banal sur la carte de campagne, un ""Tech tree"" qui porte plus sur une restriction qu'une extension de vos technologies, une IA en difficulté maximale qui se plie à votre volonté en moins de 10 minutes. Planetary Annihilation a une base de jeu solide mais qui ne saurait tarder à céder sous le poids d'un éventuel laxisme de la part des développeurs.

Bien à tous, 

Narah. | (EDIT: This review has been quite popular [Thanks for that, by the way], and I feel that in the interest of fairness I should mention that I have not played the Titans expansion, and I'm not going to, such is my dissappointment with this game. But it does perhaps bypass some of the problems I have raised here, I just don't particularly want to waste my money on it.)

I wanted so much to love this game. I'm a huge SupCom and TA fan, and this game looked like it was going to be the game that I was playing every day for the next couple of years. But after a while things were starting to look pretty bad, I came back online for the first time in a while to see if things have picked up. The game is still a very bland and repetetive experience. As an RTS all of the authentic strategy is in the first 5 minutes of each game, and then it's just who can push the most build capacity.

Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is, in my opinion, the best RTS game ever made. It's basic mechanics are excellent, the need for map control, economy management, unit management, tech management and intel are all closely interdependent, meaning that you're always INVOLVED in the battlefield even during the ""quiet"" stretches of gameplay. The available maps are excellent, and if you play on Forged Alliance Forever, a community maintained lobby with a competetive 1v1 ladder and public match service for casual players, there are stacks more to download. The game was also beautiful, with a good spread of aesthetically and strategically unique factions from the bread and butter ""space marines"" UEF, the intel oriented guerillas Cybran, the overrun focussed Aeon, and the tech heavy Seraphim. The game progression from opening to endgame is multifaceted and calls for real-time responses to your opponenents activity. To this day after 5 years of playing Forged Alliance if anybody tells me they're looking to get into a new competetive game I tell them to get FA. Similar things can be said of Total Annihilation, PA's other direct predecessor.

PA takes the ""massive-scale"" RTS format, and turns the format into an (ironically) incredibly two-dimensional experience. The units are bland and there is no faction diversity, the game escalates quickly but when it gets to its peak it tends to degenerate into a massive drag, especially across multiple planets with player interaction at a minimum, with power plays limited to a very uninteresting blob vs blob. Defensive plays just don't mean much in this game after a point. Your point defence investments will be thrown out for the sake of producing ever more units in the ongoing drudgery that is the endless escalation in this game. It sounds and is pretty cool the first few times you play it, but then you have your 10th game, and you realise you're doing more or less the same thing you did in the last 9, except there's a lava planet in this system, cool! But aside from your units not being able to drive over lakes of lava, that means very little. it's just forced no mans land. Interplanetary warfare epitomizes this. Build lots of orbital defences, build lots of fighters and send them at your opponents defences, wait 5 minutes for the fleet to arrive, hope it works, maybe send some fabricators to teleport an army from your planet to that one. I've done it so many times and I just don't really want to any more.

Huge scope for escalation in an RTS is cool, but you can't build a game on sheer escalation, which is what this is. There is no nuance, deploying a small force well is almost never going to make a game-changing difference, to the point where it's not worth trying, better stick to what you know. The learning curve is too steep as it is to try subtle strategies as a new player, and once you get to grips with the game you realise that there is very little to be done outside of beating your opponent in an arms race.

The game was released unready, and is just generally a very poor execution of a great concept, centred around a gimmick which doesn't come into play that often. My one hope for the game is that some modders come along and take the good (but extremely temperamental) engine and inject some life into it, the elements are there, but Uber half assed it, and just made the most nondescript RTS they could, and then made it really big and really long... and really fucking boring. | You want to know about Planetary Annihilation?

First, Uber shit in their community's collective faces by abandoning Planetary Annihilation as a bug-ridden, incomplete piece of garbage further made up of disappointment and empty promises. 

Second, they removed Planetary Annihilation from the Steam store entirely, further signalling their abandonment of the game, while simultaneously releasing their new full-price repackaging of the same game with the updates and content you always wanted (Planetary Annihilation: TITANS).

Third, after months of nothing but negative reviews and angry backlash from their community, they've inexplicably READDED the original Planetary Annihilation to Steam...For almost the same price as their repackaged game with more content!

Up and coming developers take note: THIS IS HOW YOU DON'T MAKE A GAME.

Curious potential buyers take note: Don't buy this game. There is the possibility of course that you might glean a couple hours of entertainment from it, but in the end it won't be worth the waste of your money or time. If you want a good RTS to play, pick up Starcraft 2 and its expansions, or Greygoo, or Company of Heroes, or Endless Legend. Just don't buy this game, Uber doesn't deserve your money. If I still haven't convinced you and you're still determined to try it, don't waste your money. Pirate this piece of trash instead. | Remember Rome: Total War? Taking over a continent with large scale armies was great. Watching hundreds of arrows arching into a tightly packed phalanx, breaking it up just before the distracting charge from your Swordsmen forced them out of position so your Cavalry could break through the side. What a game. 

I believe this is the next best thing. In terms of scale, it is crazy! Most matches have the potential to see orbital engagements, with Commander units fleeing the battle torn main planet in search of refuge. A nearby moon makes for a better base than the distant planet. Once secure, the moon is turned into a war factory, pumping out robots and tanks into a teleporter to be fed back into the foothold left on the starting planet. Then, just as your waves and waves of units seem to be breaking the enemy line of defense, they nuke your teleporter and push you completely off the planet! 

But all is not lost... You move every construction unit into the production of Halleys - giant rockets that can move small planets out of orbit... All the while inter-planetary nukes harass your anti-nuke defense and orbital units flood into your atmosphere trying to break through. But you manage to hold on just long enough to finish building your Moon of Doom, and it is time to quickly flee with your commander to the unoccupied planet. 

Now comes the fun as your push the moon into a new orbit of the sun; one which intersects with the orbit of the home planet - now riddled with machines of war, eager to break out and destroy you. However, without a foothold on the moon, nor an attempt at collonising the distant planet, your enemy has no where to go, and can only watch as a multi million ton projectile, hurled through space, smashes into his base, obliterating the planet, triggering the destruction of their Commander unit, and knocking them out of the game.

Yeah it's fun :D I just need someone to play with :(

Multiplayer is where it is at, as unlike most strategy games, you can play as the same colour, sharing controlling of the same units, as well as team up. What's more, unique game modes like 1v3v3v3 can be played due to the dedicated servers, whereby the aim of the game is to knock out the solo player who has a production bonus. Almost like a race to break into the fortress!

76561198192893105,243160,Mushroom 11,0.55,"Action, Adventure, Indie",1,"This game is honestly pretty cool! The premise of being this slime creature that moves and shapes itself with the mouse is a neat idea and how it plays out in most of the levels are a blast. I always kinda like the idea of becoming some goo monster in a video game that fiddles around with puzzles and getting into a bizzare atmosphere with fungi and decay of an old civilization of the past.

The gameplay was fun for the most part but however there were many parts in the game that felt way too annoying with how some of the puzzles played out. Some required some decent thinking while others felt as if you had to mess around until something worked and that could be both good and bad (Mostly bad). Most don't really tell you what to do nor give you any hints, so you had to mostly wander around and jumble until something worked. Ikinda wished there was a better way in taking some of the puzzles and either simplifying it or give the player a little stool to help them. I'm not saying to make the puzzles easy, I just felt that some asked for a little too much time and effort  to pass (especially the purple dot puzzles on every level).

The world building was also cool too. Granted, it is set in this post apocalyptic world where mankind went extinct and now the whole world is crumbling down with the surviving lifeforms conquering the world, a concept that has been done to DEATH alot in stories. However, I did like finding little hints of how society was before and how it lead to it's downfall but I kinda felt there should be more to explain the whole story. Most of it left like some big puzzle that was only 60% completed and not enough was being told. Either it was the devs plan to not reveal too much to lead to creative theories online or what, it was still fun.

The music was also good too. it felt very fitting with each level and I don't think I have any complaints with it. It did it's job and it did it fine. 

To end it: It was good. I still felt like the puzzles needed to be adjusted a bit but i still found the game fun.
I give it a 7.9/10"

[i]Notes[/i]
I am not a professional tactician and do not play strategy games.

[h2]Pros[/h2]
[list]
[*] It's a phenomenal idea that does what it needs to
[*] Lots of customization and micro-management possible
[*] Lots of missions and ability to progress
[*] Side-challenges reward persistence and experimentation
[/list]
[h2]Cons[/h2]
[list]
[*] Units will think that they cant have their weapon drawn when they can. This results in a lot of situations where you think you should be able to have your weapon out but you can't (resulting in failure)
[*] It is incredibly hard to get units to swing/pie a doorway without manually controlling them while they swing; it's incredibly unintuitive. Like I know what I want to do but I have no clue how to get that to happen
[*] Navigation isn't phenomenal and doing tight manuevers doesn't always work the way you'd hope them to
[*] Having to unlock more powerful guns by playing more missions is stupid in this case. I'm encountering an issue where my shield operator is significantly behind the rest of the squad because his pistol is really shitty and has poor stopping power.
[*] Game is slightly unintuitive; it doesn't feel like stuff is really explained to me directly. I would've appreciated a more direct tutorial that holds your hand through actions rather than just a ""How to Play"" button
[*] I honestly don't think grading off of time is a fun concept. A lot of whether you win a fight sometimes can feel like total luck and playing safely is playing SLOW. You do better working slowly rather than speeding through a level.

[b]Overall[/b], Door Kickers is a alright game that has been made obsolete since Door Kickers 2 exists. I have not played DK2, but from watching gameplay of it, it seems that all the cons I've listed here are gone in the next game. And since DK2 appears to be just DK1 but Better, there's not much point in buying this game. [b]HOWEVER, since this game goes on deep sales relatively often, it can still be a fun time-waster or a good demo to see if you would like the much more expensive, rarely-and-barely-on-sale DK2.[/b] So buy this on sale if you want to get a taste of what Door Kickers is like, but probably buy DK2 if this game really strikes a chord with you. | Do you like the planning part of Rainbow Six games, but hate actually participating in the FPS part?  This is the game for you. | 好玩爱玩,制定战术,突突一波,无伤统统枪毙太优雅了,太爽了!!! | Amazing and entertaining game. For this game, you have to go to the roster and switch to assault, instead of using the default pointman. The assault type can use MP5 guns which take down bad guys quicker. Using assault the game becomes easier and more fun, as you can take down the bad guys better. And I don't plan at one go, as the position of the enemies will change. I clear the areas step by step, pausing in between, and watching the action. | This game is a bit difficult at times; it constantly has me revising plans, sorting through equipment, and trying for completion. It's good at having me think out solutions instead of straight brute forcing the game all the time, this could potentially be due to the nature of RTS games, but this is my first, do I don't really know."

76561198192893105,250320,The Wolf Among Us,1.1,"Action, Adventure, Casual",3,"Excelente videojuego, una de las historias mas intrigantes e interesantes que esta gente ha traido, basado en los comics de la DC ""Fables"", The Wolf Among Us nos presenta una historia adulta sobre los personajes de las fabulas del año de la rueda traidos a la Nueva York capitalista de hoy en dia, no lo vas a querer soltar hasta que lo termines, en mi opinion, el mejor juego de Telltale. | Really nice episodic mystery RPG. The narrative is interesting, engaging, and well paced. The art style and all the voice acting fit the narrative and themes nicely.  While linear, there's still a fair amount of variation that you can experience throughout the game. I got it on sale for $5 which is totally worth it, but after playing it, I wouldn't really have a problem paying the full $15. It's a great way to spend a weekend. | Last played through this game like a decade ago, it's a masterpiece. Play it if you haven't already.
If you experience issues with stuttering, play in Windowed mode. | Ну что тут можно сказать? Очередная классная история от Telltale | This is a game that truly deserves a sequel, and I’m thrilled that Telltale has made a comeback. Hopefully, they can build on the vision of it.

Overall, The Wolf Among Us remains faithful to the vision of the comics especially in its world-building and character development, TT interwines these aspects masterfully with its signature storytelling style. I can confidently say this is the best game they have ever made. It’s a shame I played it so late. If you’re hesitating to give it a try like I did for some reason, I strongly encourage you to play it.

Unlike Heavy Rain and other point-and-click adventure murder mystery games, this one takes a fresh and unique approach to the genre.

Bigby isn’t just another cliché, drunk, miserable cop. Based on your decisions, you truly feel like an important member of the Fable community and he proves to be more than a competent detective. Rather than simply focusing on unraveling a twist, the game lets you shape the main conflict in ways that have a major impact—not just on Bigby himself, but on the entire city. This is what makes Bigby such a special and compelling character, you can truly feel the weight of his decisions, whether you choose to help others or ruin their lives."

There's a huge amount of enemies and environments, the music and ambience is perfect, it's challenging but not too hard (except for the final boss). There's a dungeon editor and a workshop with custom campaigns. I really struggle to find criticisms. I had to look up a couple puzzles that seemed somewhat obtuse. Also I felt a bit overwhelmed in the mid game trying to figure out where to go, what to do, in what order and not missing anything. Ultimately I would say it's a very good game and definitely worth a shot if you like RPGs. | C'est mon meilleur jeu de dungeon crawler rétro avec de multiples énigmes tout au long de l'aventure. Le niveau des énigmes est assez élevé et on tourne en rond assez longtemps avant de trouver la solution. Le style est assez proche de Eye of the Beholder basé sur D&D pour les presque cinquantenaires qui auraient connu ce jeu. Le jeu commence à vieillir mais une bonne énigme ne se démode jamais ! | Great game. Would play LoG 3 if it would existed | Großartiges Spiel, habe es mit Gerugon (youtuber) vorgespielt. will ich unbedingt durchspielen. | Lo acabo de terminar y me ha encantado.

Si el primero me gustó mucho, recordando de nuevo los viejos tiempos,  juegos de rol como Bloodwych, Dungeon Master o Eye of the Beholder de ese estilo, mazmorreo clásico, gestión de 4 personajes, inventario, armas, magias, esta segunda parte es mucho más, zonas abiertas, más magias, más armas, aunque esta segunda parte es conservadora, pero no necesitaba cambiar, porque es un juego buenísimo para los que nos gustan  de este tipo

Hay muchósimos secretos y zonas por explorar, posibilidad de crear tu grupo desde cero a tu gusto, la música es alucinante, y los gráficos no están nada mal.

Lo recomiendo tanto este como su primera parte.

Por cierto hay una traducción a Español para el juego, para el que le interese."
76561198192893105,251990,Long Live The Queen,1.7166666666666666,"Indie, RPG, Simulation, Strategy",4,"This game refined me. It got me out of unemployment, it reconected me to my family, it got me a masters degree, it turned me into a master athlete, it revived my jedi master, it tought me how to ride a bike and so much more. 

This is the answer to all your questions. AMEN! | It's just too arbitrary and trial and error. For me, rng and ""losing is fun"" works in roguelikes but it doesn't work in VN's, which is basically what this is.

So the whole ""losing is fun"" thing works in roguelikes because you're developing your character and you're in an open world and making tactical decisions about what to do and where to go and which skillset you're going to use to try and navigate a situation and how to maximize your skillset. And when you die (in a good roguelike), you go ""yeah, I know exactly what I did wrong and it was avoidable"". It works because you make all the tactical decisions and you choose where to go and you're the one responsible for losing or not.

Long Live the Queen on the other hand, you need to be spoiled or you just keep dying. You need to know what events are coming in advance so you know what skills to prepare for them and what moods to set this person in so you can best learn those skills. I've also read that some skills are utterly useless noob traps. 

There's no playstyle like in other ""losing is fun"" games where you say, ""Ok, I'm just going to focus on this skillset and play the game using this skillset heavily"".... because you don't have different paths to choose from, You just have one event after another placed in front of you and sometimes you just get killed and that's that.

From what I see there seems to be a fair amount of rng, too. You can do all of the above, get the right skills, and still fail the check. In my time with the game this chick couldn't pass a skill check to save her life (literally), even in skills I'd heavily developed her in.

The game has a really nice aesthetic and music and I think that's a big contributor to the review scores. But imo it's really not fun to play. | A melancholic puzzle game disguised as a Visual Novel that contains enough intrigue to keep you interested through the constant anxiety the game induces.

Highly recommend it. | Oyun boyunca genç kraliçenin yeteneklerini geliştiriyoruz derslerle ve onun yerine seçimler yapıyoruz.

 | You cannot pick a better rogue-lite game to play. Every run is gripping and fun. Every decision you make can lead to these truly wonderful emergent gameplay moments that make every action and decision you made previously carry legitimate weight.

Progression is nice, the pixel art is beautiful, the mechanics make sense.

The only complaint I personally have is the exact same complaint anyone has when playing any game that can translate to ""The Oregon Trail but with Zombies!"" or ""The Oregon Trail but with X"", and that is the fact that you never know if multiple people will suddenly get dysentery, break their legs in unison after your wagon breaks running over an ant, and then having to watch your run go down in flames as everyone slowly dies whilst limping their way toward Oregon. 

This is fortunately and unfortunately the same exact reason why Oregon Trail and Death Road to Canada work in such memorable ways, however. Its this randomness that makes when you have a good run all the more memorable. Its why you find yourself 110% invested and gripping your controls like you're choking out a robot when, despite all the crap the game's RNG threw at you, you're somehow managing to survive and perhaps even GET to CANADA.

This game is just a good time all around. You absolutely cannot go wrong with something like this if you ever in your past enjoyed The Oregon Trail, rogue-likes, and zombies. | Roguelike mt divertido pra jogar solo ou com os manos

МОЩНАЯ НАРЕЗКА ДЕМОНОВ | Lo Wang est l’agent du puissant Zilla, et est chargé de rapporter un katana mystique. Le propriétaire n’étant pas disposé à le remettre à l’homme de main, tout part en vrille. Soudain, des démons surgissent de nulle part et mettent la ville sens dessus dessous. Et pour ne rien arranger, un esprit lié au katana, Hoji, apparaît à Lo Wang et lui explique à quel point les enjeux sont énormes.

Reboot d’un FPS fait par l’équipe de Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior se distingue des autres par plusieurs points :

D’abord, une ambiance très originale alliant haute technologie et folklore asiatique. Rapidement, Lo Wang devra affronter des démons issus du bestiaire légendaire chinois. Les décors sont aussi variés, on traverse de magnifiques jardins avec des cerisiers en fleurs, des cavernes, un port, et bien d’autres environnements.

Ensuite, la possibilité de commettre de véritables carnages à grands renforts d’armes mortelles, de katas au sabre, et de pouvoirs mystiques.

Enfin, une histoire plutôt honnête, et surtout de nombreuses pointes d’humour. Lo Wang affronte la mort avec désinvolture, et les vannes fusent entre lui et son comparse onirique.

Bref, un bon cocktail d’action débridée réservé aux joueurs les plus matures, long, plaisant, honnête. | 喜剧的背后往往都是悲剧"

Ця частина вийшла відмінною і за якістю її можна порівняти з першою Deponia. Друга не так потрапила в мене і протягом всієї гри складалося враження, що її робили поспіхом.
+ Шикарний арт-дизайн. Все виконано у впізнаваному фірмовому стилі з строкатою гамою кольорів. На будь-якій локації завжди є за що зачепитися оку.
+ Прекрасно прописані персонажі. Головний герой Руфус, як і раніше, егоцентричний, цинічний і самозакоханий. Майже кожен персонаж запам'ятовується і має чітко виражений характер.
+ Добре написані діалоги. Іскрометний гумор (хоча іноді і скочується). Класні пародії.
+ Прикольні анімації та кат-сцени. Особливо сподобалося як художники попрацювали з мімікою, по обличчях можна повністю визначити емоцію героїв, або скласти їх психопортрет.
+ Відмінний музичний супровід.
+ Точно підібрані голоси озвучування.
+ Цікавий сеттинг.
+ Епічний та філософсько-емоційний фінал. Гра захоплююче закриває сюжетну арку.

+/- Олдскульні та складні головоломки можуть сподобатися не всім. Місцями химерна логіка може ввести в ступор, але це почерк Daedalic, до якого я особисто звик ;) .

- Є невеликий дисбаланс у темпі гри. Деякі розділи розтягнуті та складні, деякі проходять легше та веселіше.

У мене були деякі побоювання після другої частини, але Goodbye Deponia вийшла чудовою і подарувала багато гарних емоцій та посмішок. 8.5 з 10 | Some of the things Rufus does in this installment are utterly despicable, so I understand why some folks feel very uncomfortable about the series in general. But I think we're not meant to condone anything Rufus does just because ""it progresses the game"". I WAS legit discomforted at certain parts but perhaps that was the intention. 

Rufus is NOT a good guy.. He is an asshole who doesn't care who gets screwed over nor how as long as he gets his way.  Him being an asshole, and getting punished for his hubris is the entire point.

Few game series FORCE you to play as an utterly reprehensible, self-centered and despicable bastard , see him get exactly what he deserves in the end  and STILL feel  bad for him at the end after laughing at his past misfortunes. Or maybe you're happy with that. Your mileage may vary how much you tolerate Rufus, and that's ok.
 | Логический конец трилогии, который оставляет после себя пустоту в душе. Хочется стереть память и пройти все заново. | Goodbye Deponia was a mixed bag, where the good outweighs the bad. I am a big flustered at the ending, as it is illogical and makes little sense to me, but the journey makes the game still worth the overall experience. 

The game was a much smoother experience than the second edition of the series, but I did still have a few sections that froze and required me to close and restart the game. In all, it was mostly problem free.

The humor was hit and miss, but targeted a wide variety of topics. I have read there is some controversy on some of the humor, to which I did find some things lacking humor, many of the comedic aspects did land well. 

For me, the biggest flaw of the game is the sudden switch in the final act. The characters, in the final moments, behaved contradictory to everything that makes logical sense and the development of the characters. In short, the final moments of the game do not fit the entirety of the first two games and the third installment up to this point.

Overall, Goodbye Deponia is recommended, as a funny and sometimes edgy humor casual experience. We do not know what drives a creative mind to make sudden changes, but it is their story to frame or burn in the museum of presented art. | ユーモラスのセンスが合うかどうかですかね。私は合わなかった。"
76561198192893105,259060,Dominions 4: Thrones of Ascension,3.533333333333333,"Indie, Strategy",0,"Just way too complicated for me - this game has gathered dust in my library for years because every time I've tried to play it I've just landed up scratching my head trying to understand what is going on - even a tutorial video on YouTube took like an hour just to get past some of the starting options, before even really getting into any game play.

Not helped by the fact that there doesn't seem to be a proper inbuilt tutorial (well there is in theory, but it directs me towards reading the manual and there is no on-screen help or tips that I can see). I like inbuilt tutorials because surely the people who developed the game should be best placed to tell us about all the mechanics and what is important, and if they don't see making the game comprehensible as being important then I'm kinda wondering why.

Within the game I just feel like there is too much stuff - do you want your pretender to be a dragon or a tree, what types of unit (of the many many types on offer) do you want to build, keeping in mind that they all have quite complicated stats and features, and it's not clear to me at all where I get things like research from etc - like I just don't understand at all the decisions I'm supposed to be making and I assume the only way to properly understand is to spend many many hours on Youtube tutorials and playing the game through repeatedly. I think that one thing which I feel makes it harder as a beginner is that many of these decisions feel quite drastic - i.e. having a large potential impact - it's not like choosing a civ which will be slightly better at tech, or slightly better with military, some of these feel like very fundamental and major choices and I don't really understand them or their potential impact later in the game at all.

I appreciate some people will read this and think I'm just lazy for not putting in more time to understand it properly but the simple reality is that I don't have the time or energy to understand something this complicated where the developers haven't really (in my view) made a bit more effort to ease me into it, with a proper tutorial and maybe a more user-friendly interface / hints, and some efforts to help me understand what the realistic impact of different decisions might be. I've played plenty of strategy games with various levels of complexity but for me this is complicated past the point where I feel like I will enjoy overall spending the time required to understand it. I have lot of other games in my library which I've played more (many of them cheaper than this one) because they are fairly easy to get into and have a good tutorial to get started, and I have a job where I'm expected to explain what I've done to customers rather than just sending them something overcomplicated and expecting them to work for hours to figure it out. So I just don't really see a good argument as to why this game couldn't be a bit more user friendly.

p.s. I am not whingeing about the graphics here, I would still pick up Civ 2 and play it very happily if I had a copy right now I just think this game is too complicated for me to get into and the interface / lack of a proper tutorial doesn't help. | I simply don't get it. You'll be doing fine keeping up constantly against a computer opponent then BAM, they drop 860 troops. I finally had one going fine and had half the board secure and steadily advancing then BAM, I stormed a castle after 6 rounds of siege and my entire board was wiped out. My God was secure and all the way in the back portion of the map so not in anyway vulnerable. Just YOU LOSE! The enemy didn't have even 100 troops near my location I was attacking and I had close to 1000. Makes no sense but won't ever involve any time in this game again.

Você passa um bom tempo jogando como se ele fosse um jogo qualquer, quando na verdade o rumo que se deve ter é completamente diferente. Darkest Dungeon é uma das minhas experiências mais difíceis que eu tive nos últimos anos com jogos. A jogabilidade é extremamente punitiva, nociva caso não saiba o que está fazendo. Um dos núcleos do jogo, é o dinheiro. É necessário entrar nas missões (dungeons), se importar com fazer dinheiro, sua sobrevivência e ainda completar o seu objetivo. Conciliar todos esses fatores, transforma a experiência em um ciclo maçante de fazer dinheiro e upar personagens para o final do jogo. Penso que essa ferramenta utilizada para ser a ponte principal do Darkest Dungeon, pode ser bem mal vista para quem pensa em zerar o jogo.

Mas, além de tudo, gostaria de enaltecer a arte característica e virtuosa, que transmite perfeitamente a atmosfera obscura das dungeons, da sofrência e do medo. A direção artística voltada ao tema ""Lovecrafteana"", é muito bem feito, principalmente no que se diz progressão visual. Os ambientes se tornando mais medonhas cada vez que você vai progredindo para o final do jogo, a mudança de cores voltadas ao cosmo e carnificina ou até mesmo as músicas que passam de um violino arranhado e agitado para algo mais ""contemplador""

Por fim, vai minha dica:
- Se você quiser uma experiência menos massiva, jogue na dificuldade Radiante
- Caso queira sofrer um pouco mais, tendo que repetir missões para ficar mais forte, jogue na Mais Escura
- E se você for um mutante, jogue na mais difícil mesmo, é uma experiência semelhante a estar em um quarto branco com camisa de força no corpo | 新手上手不难，甚至比月计还简单一些，风格也熟悉，各位主管，司书，管理员必入 | This is a game I played on an off for years, and both loved it and grew frustrated by it as I played.  This last year I decided it was time to beat the game finally, so I dedicated a bit more of my gaming time to it, and feel I can give some fairly informed thoughts on the game.  

Darkest Dungeon has a fun party management system that is well designed and the heart and soul of the game.  Do you select your ranged skills for your Highwayman so he can be in position 3?  Or do you take his pos 1/2 skills and play more of a high risk high reward style of play up front?  Do you put your jester in the back making him a buffing character?  Or do you put him further forward so you can apply bleed and be more of a DPS character?  It allows you to make a lot of different parties in different ways, and as you play you learn what combo's works best for each situation, and which ones you prefer to play.  

The enemies also have positions that work differently for each enemy type, and some of your characters will let you manipulate the positions of your enemies to mess them up or put them in a position for one of your other characters to pummel them into the dirt.   So overall the game play is EXCELLENT.

Where I had my struggles with the game was losing characters.  When I first started playing the game it really hurt to lose that Leper that I had been using effectively for so many dives into the dungeon.  I eventually learned that dying is an important aspect of the game, and if you upgrade your stagecoach you will be just fine.  The death of the characters also adds weight to your decisions in the game.  If you decide to get too crazy with a party/skill composition there is a very real chance you are going to lose some of your characters.  So if you decide to play Darkest dungeon just accept right off the bat that death is part of the grim dark theme of the game.

The other aspect of the game that people may not like is the tone and atmosphere of the game.  It is a grim dark themed horror game.  Horror is not really my jam to be honest, but the game play and how the theme is executed, and the great narration of the game drew me in despite my lack of interest in the horror genre.  

Overall the game play is excellent, and the setting, style and art of the game is unique and intriguing.  I would highly recommend this to people looking for a great rogue like dungeon crawler that stands out in an over crowded market."

[i]Сюжет в Project Zomboid начинается с того, что игрок оказывается в одном из домов штата Кентукки, окружённого зомби. Основная цель — выжить как можно дольше в этом новом, опасном мире. Игрок может выбрать начальную локацию и профессию персонажа, каждая из которых даёт определённые бонусы к навыкам, таким как строительство, скрытность или звероловство. Создание персонажа также включает выбор негативных характеристик, таких как лишний вес или никотиновая зависимость, что добавляет игре глубины и вариативности.[/i]

[b]Графика и дизайн:[/b]
[i]Графика в игре довольно проста и минималистична, что, однако, не мешает погружению в атмосферу зомби-апокалипсиса. Основное внимание уделено детализированному окружению и реалистичным механикам выживания. Локации в игре обширны и полны интересных мест для исследования, что создаёт ощущение живого и динамичного мира.[/i]

[b]Игровой процесс:[/b]
[i]Игровой процесс Project Zomboid сосредоточен на выживании в условиях постоянной угрозы зомби. Игрок должен искать еду и воду, создавать экипировку, строить убежища и защищаться от орд зомби. Игра требует внимательного планирования и адаптации к меняющимся условиям. Электричество и водоснабжение со временем отключаются, продукты портятся, и игроку приходится искать новые способы обеспечения своих нужд.[/i]

[b]Механики выживания:[/b]
[i]Одной из ключевых особенностей игры является разнообразие механик выживания. Игрок может стать фермером, лесником, строителем или даже водителем, что влияет на его способности и потребности. Например, фермер будет заботиться о посевах и урожае, а водитель — о поиске топлива и запчастей для машины. Каждая профессия и навык повышает характеристики персонажа, такие как готовка, строительство или бег.[/i]

[b]Зомби и мир игры:[/b]
[i]Зомби в Project Zomboid представлены медленными, но многочисленными существами, от которых легко убежать, но сложно уничтожить всех. Инфекция от укуса зомби смертельна в 100% случаев, что делает скрытность и осторожность основными тактиками выживания. Мир игры постоянно меняется: происходят случайные события, такие как выстрелы вдалеке или пролетающие вертолёты, которые могут привлечь внимание зомби и сформировать орды.[/i]

[b]Звук и музыка:[/b]
[i]Звуковое сопровождение в Project Zomboid является одним из ключевых элементов, создающих атмосферу ужаса и напряжения. Реалистичные звуки окружения, напряженные звуки зомби и мрачная музыка делают игру более захватывающей и атмосферной. Несмотря на некоторые возможные недостатки, звуковое оформление в целом усиливает погружение игрока в мир зомби-апокалипсиса и помогает лучше ощутить все трудности выживания.[/i]

[/list][/i]

[h1]Заключение:[/h1]
[i]“Project Zomboid” — увлекательная и затягивающая игра для любителей симуляторов выживания и зомби-апокалипсисов. С её реалистичными механиками, вариативностью персонажей и локаций, а также атмосферой живого и постоянно меняющегося мира, игра предлагает уникальный опыт, который понравится тем, кто ценит глубину и реализм в играх. Несмотря на простую графику, то что игра в раннем доступе и монотонность на длительной дистанции, Project Zomboid станет отличным выбором для тех, кто ищет сложное и увлекательное развлечение.[/i]

Ah yes, [b]Goat Simulator[/b], the game that boldly asks, ""[i]What if a goat could headbutt reality itself?[/i]"" If you've ever woken up and thought, ""[i]I want to wreak havoc as a physics-defying goat,[/i]"" then congratulations – your oddly specific dream is now a reality.  

This is not just a game; it's a [b]life experience[/b]. Forget saving kingdoms, fighting dragons, or becoming a space marine – you're a goat, and your only mission is to turn everything into absolute chaos. Climb ladders with your nonexistent hands, lick random objects (because goats apparently have magnetic tongues), and launch yourself into orbit because physics in this universe took a permanent vacation.  

[hr]  
[b]Highlights:[/b]  

[b]Story:[/b] There isn’t one. You’re a goat. Make your own story. Maybe you’re a disgruntled farm animal on a quest for revenge. Or maybe you’re just vibing in a world where everything explodes when you touch it.  

[b]Graphics:[/b] Stunningly realistic… if the world was designed by someone who just discovered ragdoll physics and said, ""[i]More. MORE![/i]""  

[b]Gameplay:[/b] Imagine playing Skyrim but with no quests, no objectives, and way more headbutting. It’s perfect for people who enjoy the feeling of total anarchy without consequences.  

[b]Soundtrack:[/b] Mostly goat bleats, explosions, and the sweet sound of destruction. It’s beautiful.  

[b]Replayability:[/b] Endless. Every time you boot it up, you’ll find a new, equally absurd way to destroy everything around you.  

[hr]  
[b]Pros:[/b]  
- You can become a demon goat, a robot goat, or even a goat that’s somehow a giraffe. Truly revolutionary character customization.  
- Break the laws of physics with zero remorse.  
- There’s a multiplayer mode, because why wreak havoc alone when you can bring friends?  

[b]Cons:[/b]  
- None. It’s a flawless work of art. (Okay, maybe it crashes sometimes, but let’s call that a feature.)  

[hr]  
[b]Final Thoughts:[/b]  

[b]Goat Simulator[/b] is not the game we deserve, but it’s the game we needed. It’s a love letter to chaos, and it reminds us all that sometimes, you just need to let loose and headbutt a car for no reason.  

[b]Rating:[/b] 10/10 – The [b]GOAT[/b] of all simulation games. | Взял по скидке на зимней распродаже, хотя даже без скидки стоит брать.
О всех наигранных часах не жалею хоть их и мало (на момент написания почти 40 часов).
Прошел на все ачивки, есть и бесячие, и очень интересные.
Единственное не понравилось ДЛС ""GOATZ"" очень скучное, и играл в него ток ради ачивок.
Остальные ДЛС просто бомба, хотя даже без них в игре есть чем занятся.
Игра полностью оправдывает деньги даже 2025 году, один минус - нехватка мультиплеера, но это есть в след. части (которой к сожалению у меня нет, но жду скидку чтобы купить:D)

У біблійній традиції, зокрема у Книзі розробників, описується створення світу Coffee Stain Studios протягом шести днів, кожен з яких має свої специфічні події. Ось короткий огляд того, що сталося кожного з цих тижнів: [/b]
[hr][/hr]

[i] [h1] Тиждень 1: [/h1]
    • Coffee Stain Studios придумав Козла, відділив його від темряви персонажів, створивши концепцію безумства та гри
      [hr][/hr]
[h1] Тиждень 2: [/h1]
    • Coffee Stain Studios створив ігрову твердь та небо, поділивши води над твердю від вод під твердю так і створили біом.
      [hr][/hr]
[h1] Тиждень 3: [/h1]
    • Coffee Stain Studios зібрав всі ідеї скинув в одне місце і перемішав, відкривши безумство як рушійну силу, яку назвав ""Goat Simulator"", а зібрані напрацювання — «Хороший документ з дизайну». Він також створив рослинність: трави, рослини, що приносять віртуальні плоди та дерева, що несуть графічне насіння.
      [hr][/hr]
[h1] Тиждень 4: [/h1]
    • Coffee Stain Studios виставив світло, написали кодом, місця переміщення між локаціями та фізику предметів.
      [hr][/hr]
[h1] Тиждень 5: [/h1]
    • Coffee Stain Studios населив землю не розумними людино — істотами та створив птахів, що літають над землею. Він благословив цих створінь, щоб бігали та удавали, що наче живі.
      [hr][/hr]
[h1] Тиждень 6: [/h1]
    • Coffee Stain Studios створив наземних тварин, скрипти поведінки, плагіни та, нарешті, Козла за Своїм образом(бо головний гейм дизайнер у Компанії дійсно козел, іншого я не придумав пояснення). Він дав Козлу владу над усіма функціями по ігровому світу та у небі. [/i]
      [hr][/hr]
[h1] Після цих шести тижнів творення, Coffee Stain Studios зібрали вечірку на сьомий тиждень, після того, як портували гру на всі можливі платформи. І стали збирати хайп, хейт та зелених президентів. [/h1]

[b] ""Goat Simulator"" від студії Coffee Stain Studios — це відеогра, що вийшла у 2014 році, яка відразу ж стала культовим явищем завдяки своїй абсурдності та нестандартному підходу до геймплею.
[hr][/hr]

Графіка в ""Goat Simulator"" навмисно недосконала, що є частиною її чарівності (бо гра надихає на створення ігор з необмеженим потенціалом, використовуючи конструктор Unreal Engine чи Unity). Це не зусилля на висококласну візуалізацію, а скоріше нагадування про старі, менш потужні ігри(що є актуальними та хорошими іграми крізь роки: [url=store.steampowered.com/app/40800/Super_Meat_Boy/] Super Mario Bros, The Legend of Zelda, Minecraft, [/url]  [url=store.steampowered.com/app/24780/SimCity_4_Deluxe_Edition/] SimCity [/url] , [url=store.steampowered.com/developer/civilization]  Civilization [/url] , [url=store.steampowered.com/app/455400/PACMAN_256/]  Pac-Man [/url] , Street Fighter, [url=store.steampowered.com/curator/34459938]  Final Fantasy [/url] , [url=store.steampowered.com/curator/35501448]  Doom [/url] , [url=store.steampowered.com/app/2114810/Tetris_Girls/]  Tetris [/url] ).Моделі персонажів, особливо кози, виконані з гумором, і всілякі недоліки в анімації додають грі комічного ефекту. Ігровий світ виглядає як мініатюра справжнього світу, з його фізикою, що часто призводить до кумедних ситуацій.(не баг, а фіча).
[hr][/hr]
Суть гри полягає в тому, щоб бути Козлом, у всіх сенсах, можна робити майже все, що завгодно, без жодної мети або сюжету. Ви можете стрибати, літати, руйнувати об'єкти, вчиняти хаос. Фізика в грі часто поводиться непередбачувано(чого варті тільки стрибки та використання язика), що робить кожну сесію гри унікальною. Є різні режими гри, які додають різноманітності, але суть залишається тією ж — творити безлад.

You start with the tutorials, which have certainly gotten better over the years. They are helpful, but leave you wanting more. So you turn to the internet. Reddit is helpful, then you find the thousands of hours of Youtube videos and realize how deep the rabbit hole goes.
After binging about a days worth of online videos, you get back on the game and try to build something. You realize it doesn't work despite doing what you saw in the video. You go back to the video, and see that it was from 2021. Its all outdated. The devs ARE active. This game is receiving constant updates and fixes. It has been getting those fixes constantly for YEARS, and the devs have given no indication of slowing down or stopping. In 2024 alone they introduced two new weapons systems, a ton of new blocks, fixed a bunch of bugs, updated nearly every campaign ship and tank, and changed a handful of game mechanics for the better. Great devs.

Okay, you found a tutorial from 2024, watch it, and jump back in game.
You want to create a small boat. Yay! You spend what feels like days creating the most intricate tool of insurgency war ever devised by a sole rambot. You figure this piece of engineering excellence can take over the world. You jump straight into a campaign run, easy mode of course, lets not too ahead of ourselves. You realize you have no idea how to run a campaign, so you go watch a borderwise video on it. Come back, set up a supply line and make your first boat from earlier. An enemy!
Its a tiny little Deep Water Guard craft. Essentially a little wooden raft with a couple missiles. You obliterate it with ease. See, you were right. This game isn't as hard as people say.
Oh look, another enemy! A duster? Sounds easy. Wait, its a plane. You forgot any AA and your missiles can't turn enough. You Quickly slap on a simple weapon and get a lucky hit. Woah, that was close.
Uh oh, another enemy. He's invading! The audacity!
Its a Wanda? Fairly Odd name. Lets fight, bring it on! Wait, that's a big shell. OH NO! He one shot me? WTF?
You rage quit. Twp days later you come back and start building a battleship, with a Lathrix video playing in the background.

Yeah, this game is great. Huge learning curves and opportunities. I have over 1,100 hours as of this review, and have much to learn. As the great psychedelic frog put it, the game has a learning curve ""like a cliff, on fire, and covered in bears."" Beware that warning, and the sinkhole that is this game and its numerous overlapping mechanics. 
Yes, I absolutely adore and recommend this game to anyone that likes building games of any sort. Embrace the first 5-10 hours of confusion and learning suck. It gets better, then worse, then it becomes like drugs. After a hundred hours or so, you discover decorations and mimics, then time begins to delete itself. 

Get this game. It good. | I feel bad because i use some of the pre-built vehicles, but at the same time i can't be bothered spending hundreds of hours developing extensive crafts. I've still made stuff of my own, and they work well, but yk. Also great game, 10/10 should get haha its really fun. I can't play it to its fullest extent on my laptop since the frames dip pretty often, but for the most part its a really fun strategy game. | There is a new camera system that is impressively terrible. Just doing basic things like ""How do I move the camera to this unit on the map"" is a constant trip to the forums. I am all for changing things for the potential of improvement, but this new system is atrocious.

Edit: Also to the unhelpful snarky developer review - that just straight up isn't true. In either the command mode with ('e') or the map mode with ('m'), left clicking does not change the camera to that location, it simply selects a unit if there happens to be one, or does nothing if there does not. The camera does not change in either case when you leave either map screen, and it certainly does not do the old option of repositioning the camera via the map. Yes, I can warp there - there are many moments in this game that require moving a camera without moving the character to a location. | [b]I love this game, I really do but, as it stands I can't recommend the game with how the game continues to be updated.[/b]

[h2]Background[/h2]
I've played 2,100 hours so far, and I hope I'll play more, but this game really feels like it's stuck in terminal Alpha or development hell, where controls and Core systems are fundamentally changed too frequently.

New and experienced players are both negatively impacted, new players have very few people to teach them when these changes have been made to the game and they continue to blindside us when they are released.

[h2]Current Issues[/h2]
The most recent update has altered the camera controls and how the player's avatar works to the point where I can't comfortably play the game anymore, and it no longer feels intuitive to use.

From my perspective, the changes to the controls cannot be justified this far into the development of the game (From the Depths being fully released out of Early Access quite some time ago) and have negatively impacted the quality of the game overall.

There is no way to revert these changes as far as I'm aware without reverting to an older version of the game, effectively locking me out of future updates unless a future update adds back the older control system and options are made when playing the game to use the old Avatar system.

[h2]My Current Recommendations and Opinion[/h2]
I can't recommend this game as it stands; too much is changed too often. Given that this game is inherently complex to the point of needing to scrawl through the Wiki and Reddit posts to figure things out to even the most basic levels of understanding, It's not wise to invest the time and money into the game while the basics are still in flux and can be changed on a dime and make the game unplayable for you. 

Give it a few more years, and check back when the game is a bit more stable on the development side of things. | This game is great, I have had this game since it came out but never dared to play it as it looked to difficult. 
A week ago I finally had enough courage to try and just jumped in the campaign mode after looking at a YouTube vid or 2. Made a thing, it got destroyed, made another thing, same. Restarted with the knowledge I gained and then actually was able to beat the first encounter. Since then I've been building all kinds of cool stuff. 
I do recommend Gmodism and Borderwise on YouTube. Just to learn the camera controls and how the campaign works. 
After that just try stuff.. and if you need help-> discord, very helpful people there!"

I am unable to even launch the game anymore and have tried hundreds of hours to try fixing it. It's unplayable and the support I've reached out to either ignores me or says it's steam's issue for the game not working and steam won't take any form of help when requests are made to them. This is a great example why you shouldn't throw in extra connections or third party connections etc. One thing is removed and it's all broke.What's worse? They're still trying to sell the game despite KNOWING it's unplayable. They KNOW it's unplayable and still choose to sell it. A, at this time, $29.99 game that is NOT ABLE TO BE STARTED. 

When the game is fixed the review will be changed obviously but until then I can not recommend the game to anyone. I do not reccomend buying this gaming NFT."

音楽や映像はきれいだと思うよ！！ | One of the most genius games I've ever played. The creators made a perfectly functional, engaging, and beautiful game while maintaining a low technology requirement. This thing can run on my phone or tablet just as well as a high powered pc. While other companies are either trying to revive bad old game styles to pump out a dozen cheap games a month, or pushing pc limits so far that most people won't be able to fully enjoy their game until 5 years after release, these guys actually got it.  Gorgeous landscapes designs and characters, entertaining and thought provoking interactive story, and rock solid tactical combat that doesn't get bogged down in excessive complications. The game has never crashed, the game looks amazing years after release, and the creators didn't have to update the living poop out of it after release for it to be ""balanced"".  Damn good job Stoic Games. | It's really good--and not just good--it's really fun! Art, voice acting, setting, characters, story, combat, all enjoyable. Encounters, both violent and peaceful, are laced into traversing across the map in a way that's nicely reminiscent of a classic session of D&D. The choices you make throughout this journey really do matter, or at least they did a very good job of making it feel that way, which I take as a sign they knew exactly what they were doing when writing the game. I think what stands out as the best part of the whole thing, though, is the music, which constitutes one of the best game soundtracks I've ever heard.

I can't think of any negatives other than the voice acting was so good that I wish there had been more of it since most dialogue scenes are not voiced (which isn't really a problem in itself). 

This will probably scratch your ""turn-based combat"" or ""choices matter"" itch if you have, say, some post-BG3 depression. | The Banner Saga is one of my favorite games. Having played this several times throughout the years, and coming back again in 2025, it still holds up very well. I could not highly recommend this one enough.

 A well written story with established lore, and a world setting filled with relatable, enjoyable characters. Beautifully hand drawn backdrops, scenery, and character arts. This game pulls you in with its brilliant soundtrack. Ranging from quiet ambiance of blowing winds and people working around camps, drums and string melodies, and growing crescendos of brass instruments during battle. As always, the soundtrack is my favorite aspect in games. 

 Gameplay is is part Turn-Based Tactics, and narrative decision making, similar to The Oregon Trail and other titles. You will have to make tough decisions. Decisions made during what is would amount to a large scale military invasion. Consequences in which may see people and characters die, or decisions that may feel insignificant, but may play out eventually in Saga 2 or 3. 

 What I believe that makes this game so good, is that the main character, Rook, starts out as ordinary. Just a man trying to navigates his caravan and clansmen to safety. We, the players, follow along his journey (and others) knowing as little of the situation as the characters themselves, making it as much our journey as well. 

The Banner Saga is trilogy of games. If you interested in the concept, give this one a go. Again, I cannot highly recommend this enough. | The game mechanics are great. The lore of the game is cool, but the storytelling is terrible and hurt the fun aspects of the game. It's also very unclear how you're supposed to interpret certain parts of the story. There are parts where I'm following the dialogue and just don't get what's happening. I also found that the leveling up mechanic worked very poorly, because the level up resource, Renown, is the same thing you use to buy items and rations. This creates a situation where your team strength is hampered because you have to buy rations to keep the party fed and morale high. The game is also very unclear about how stats work. For example, I looked around in game but couldn't find anywhere to explain how dodge percentage is calculated. This results in having no idea how strong or weak certain items are. Very frustrating experience, wouldn't recommend anyone play this game but it has potential if they can sort out these issues."
76561198192893105,274230,RONIN,1.2166666666666666,"Action, Indie",2,"needs more cooking, but its a really really good game, very fun, buggy sometimes, but its a really cool idea | If you're looking for a game to enjoy for a few hours then move on, and you don't mind having to occasionally retry a single part of a level a dozen times, then this is a good choice. | Fun little turn based action platformer thing. The mechanics can be a bit jank sometimes but it's enjoyably frustrating | This game is like a simple turn-based mix of Gunpoint and Mark of the Ninja, but the idea is wasted. It is just too unpolished, too unbalanced, too buggy and the game design choices are stupid.

The controls are simple enough but too clunky. It is not easy to aim with the very and very limited umprecise jump trajectory, but it is too easy to make a mistake, like unintentional ceiling grab while in combat. And the real-time movement plus turn-based combat just don’t work so fluently together in this game, making very unfair situations where you cannot do nothing than getting shot. And there are lots of trial and error gameplay which is not a good at all.

The level design is otherwise good, but it is just impossible to complete the levels without causing alarm and lockdown. There are simply too many guards around to raise the alarm quickly at any time, and most of the time you are forced to avoid the laser sights without any chance to kill those constantly shooting guards. The guards have way too long range and detection distance. The player character cannot just kill the guards automatically when getting close enough instead of knocking them down? And the guards could not accidentally shoot each other? Those would have added extra strategy and extra fun.

It is so stupid that the game says early on ""this is not a stealth game"" but yet you are not supposed to cause alarm and the level design does not support gameplay without causing alarms. And the problem with that when unavoidable lockdown happens, you have lost all your chances to earn a skill point which is really needed to get new upgrades. It is so stupid that all the level objectives must be met to earn just one skill point. Otherwise you won't get any upgrade from the skill tree. And there are even empty skills slots in which you can waste your very few skill points.

And lastly the game is buggy. It is not uncommon to clip through walls, ceilings or even ground when using the grappling hook. It happened occasionally which is annoying. There is always a chance to reload from the latest checkpoint, but even still and the checkpoint system is poor in this game.

So one time with this is just enough. Do not buy at full price. | Fun game, I loved it."
76561198192893105,274290,Gods Will Be Watching,0.23333333333333334,"Adventure, Indie",0,"This is probably one of my favorite games and I feel the need to explain why it's polarizing the audience as much as it does. It's a time loop story like Groundhog Day or Tomorrow War. There were, I think, six scenes originally, with an epilogue added later. You get through each scene by surviving to the end and making tough mortal decisions. Who gets shot? Who gets to eat? Etc. There is not a happy path for everyone.

The difficulty of the original game was brutal and you'd really spend a several hours figuring out something that would in theory need a couple of minutes to complete. You'd learn how actions and consequences are connected. You'd memorize the order in which things happen. You'd need to learn to navigate the probabilities of success and failure of every action, and attempt to proceed regardless. Failure is intricately woven into every part of the story. Getting through it along with the main character is truly cathartic and unforgettable.

But it was listed as a Point and Click, setting an expectation that you get through challenges by combining a rubber glove with a milk bottle and using it on a taco van to get a granite toothbrush you'll need later. In reality even a step by step guide wouldn't really work because things don't quite go the same way each time. Eventually the developers released a Mercy Patch with several easier difficulties because people feel entitled to win and complain vocally if they don't. This shifted the player base into giving up early and changing difficulty to easy, inevitably failing to go through the original intended experience. Now nobody is happy. | Não gostei, não costumo ser critica com jogos mas tive que vir falar sobre esse, o jogo traz todo um peso sobre fazer escolhas dificeis/sacrificios o tempo todoooo e tudo mais mas no fim o peso dessas escolhas não importam, tanto o final do jogo quanto o final da DLC são ruins, o jogo te dá apenas uma falsa sensação de escolha.
Os niveis são bem desafiadores pra quem gosta, a arte do jogo é bonita, a história do jogo também é bacana e seria um ótimo jogo se os finais tivessem sido melhores desenvolvidos pois pra mim qual o sentido de jogar horas algo se as suas escolhas não importam e acabam naquele final nada ver???
No meu caso que sou alguem que gosto muito de jogos de história e de escolha foi uma perda de tempo, não jogaria novamente, mas para quem gosta de desafios pode ser que goste das fases do jogo que são bem desenvolvidas e complicadas dependendo da dificuldade que escolher jogar, só não espere um grande final, fiquei decpcionada pois esperava mais do jogo. | This game is extremely difficult to the point of being frustrating, half of it also completely reliant in RNG and you might as well be pulling a slot machine whether or not you win to the point of being downright unfair, the levels can be really long and exhausting
10/10 amazing game | Narrative-required RNG is shoved into the flow of the game in a fashion somehow more perpendicular than sideways. It is mandatory to the vision of the game to play russian roulette with a rather annoying amount of time at stake, a lot of tension is created this way, but the moment it goes bad, the tension is gone and it's *another* instant-loss-to-rng obstacle you can do absolutely nothing about, which is the narrative point of that obstacle to be that way. You can't really escape that with other difficulties, which best shorten how long ordeals need to be survived or shift the odds needed a little more in your favour.  I can't really recommend that. | Never mind my play time, we go way back.
You like brutal situations? You like to control chaos? Not put off by the unfair and uncaring cosmos?

Например, несмотря на по сути бесконечный ужас неизбежной смерти, наш мозг обычно достаточно неплохо его блокирует, как раз потому, что это нечто настолько далёкое и нам неподвластное, что будто и не принадлежит нашей реальности. Но если вдруг появится лекарство, дающее вечную жизнь,  и вам оно не достанется, смерть окажется не просто полностью реальной, но ещё и пугающе близкой на фоне упущенной альтернативы. Тогда и откроется настоящая экзистенциальная безысходность, хотя ситуация в целом никак не изменилось.

Забавно, люди стремились к центру леса, потому что их звали голоса родных или то, что им дорого. Главный герой стремился домой, а игрок стремился к счастливой концовке, и когда игра даёт это, ты оказываешься в центре леса. Это работает на 100%, когда ты смотришь на людей и думаешь: ""Ну это же очевидно уловка, как они ведутся?"", ведь тебя точно так же развели. И только отказавшись от того, к чему стремился ты можешь увидеть всё как есть. | 没引导，难操作，主角肾肾又虚虚，地图弯弯又绕绕。实话实说，《阴暗森林》不是个完美的游戏，它不适合所有人，甚至可以说不适合大多数人，最直接的证据就是：这游戏的通关成就是金的。

It's a very terrifying game until you get used to it. Then, it's a very FUN survival game. The mechanics are easy to figure out after a while. I beat the game twice and already going for a 3rd time on nightmare.

It gives you JUST enough if you spend enough time following the paths to side quests. Truely an impressive game. | [h1] [9/10]极其优秀的恐怖生存游戏 [/h1]
Darkwood最强的一点是将“有限视野”运用到了极致。本应为上帝视角的俯视，能看清的部分却只有人物面前的一块扇形区域，这种有限视野创造了许多极佳的演出效果（例如一转头某个生物就消失了）。视野的局限性，场景的明暗变化和悬疑神秘的背景音乐相得益彰，渲染了强烈浓厚的恐怖氛围。是的，阴暗森林恐怖之处不在于跳脸杀，而在于其引起玩家源自对于未知事件和超自然力量（森林）的发自本能的恐惧。游玩本游戏需要有强大的心理承受能力，因为（一周目）真的很恐怖。
游戏内npc之间的关系错综复杂，并且主角的任何行动都会影响npc的结局。游戏剧情不算晦涩程度，也称得上优秀。诡谲的美术风格、碎片化叙事手法，令人沉沦在森林中欲罢不能。
此外，Darkwood的人怪平衡做得很不错，进入下一个区域会有更可怕的怪物，同时也会有更强力的武器，不存在“越级打怪”的情况。因此克服了心理恐惧之后玩家会发现：其实这游戏也没那么难。并且本游没有纯粹数值怪和机制粪怪，游玩体验其实相当不错。[spoiler] 我才不会告诉你我因为火力恐惧症囤了一箱子弹结果到了结局一大半没用 [/spoiler]
10分给9分，扣的一分在于游戏二周目可以走不同支线，三周目往上游玩内容就基本重复了。但初次体验的内容就足够物超所值了。另外游戏为了增强沉浸感，舍弃了绝大部分物品的使用引导，导致不查攻略前期会过得比较困难（看steam成就完成度便可见一斑，13个成就11个隐藏的含金量）。不过本人还是非常推荐感兴趣、承受能力强的人入手这款游戏，你会爱上它的。 | Esse jogo é uma obra-prima.

76561198192893105,278420,Spider: Rite of the Shrouded Moon,1.5833333333333333,"Action, Adventure, Indie",1,"So let me be blunt. I loved playing this game. I love spiders and I played the app that came before this game when I was super young. Playing through it and finding all the clues and secrets is cool and interesting. Here is the big draw back that ruins the game. The developers seem to have closed servers and don't seem to be responding to new players. This game plays around with local weather and daytime settings and you need to play at specific times to allow for clues to be found and progression to occur. Now that the local weather is down and has been for a while, you can no longer use your on methods to ""time-travel"" and get these clues. You are locked in with the base location and can only change the weather and daytime once each phase of the moon. To final clue and puzzle needs you to play at night when there is a new moon, but only then. As of the day I am making this review, tonight is currently a new moon. I still need 4 other moon phases to unlock the ability to go to the last level, get the super rares bugs there, and finish the final clue, but I can't because I need those moon phases. This means that I have to wait a full 30 days before I can finish the game even though I'm this close to the end of the game. While the idea of using local weather is super cool, making it a requirement for progression was a bad idea. It should have stayed for scoring means only. I was having so much fun until I found out I need to keep a close eye and have a perfect schedule over the next month or else I have to wait another month if I miss something. Would recommend this game unless you just want to make webs and catch bugs. Really disappointed and hoping the developers do something to change this. | This game has couple of great ideas and gimmicks, that some people will absolutely love
and I do understand why they do.
But
Instead of being fascinated by them, it really started piss me off when I can't just play the game without waiting for the right moon phase/weather/time. In modern day's hectic life it's sometimes hard to find the time to enjoy good games, and it's just annoying when the game itself is placing time tables/schedules for you just so that you can even finish it. I would understand this in secrets but the fact you can't even finish it without this gimmick is just frustrating.
And on a side note: In my opinion the game's OST doesn't match the game's atmosphere at all.

Some people will love it, I would like to but what makes this game good for other just made it bad for me. | Great for playing casually, pain to complete fully. 

You need to do certain actions when real-world weather in your georgaphical location has certain properties (raining, full moon, and so forth), and I'm not kind of pearson to play a game in selective bursts.

But gameplay is very fluid, music is nice, and this game's subplot is very interesting, so I urge you to try it anyway. | Spider: Rite of the Shrouded Moon - это пазл-платформер, разработчики же называют жанр игры, как экшен-пазл. К этой игре приминимы оба этих жанра, но есть и другая сторона монеты, т.к. это полноценный симулятор паука. 

Геймплей игры строится по принципу поедания разного рода мошек,жучков,сверчков и т.д., но это только на первый взгляд. К разным насекомым - разный подход, кого-то надо поймать в прыжке, кого-то в прочно сплетённую паутину, что безусловно вносит разнообразие в геймплей, но главная изюминка игры не в этом. Локация на которой охотится наш паук, старый особняк и его владения, прототипом которого послужил реальный особняк в штате Вермонт (США). Вот в этом и есть её изюминка, разработчики подготовили не просто приключения паука, а вплели в игру загадки которые связанны с реальным особняком, луной и её фазами и чтобы их разгадать вам будет мало пространства игры. Вам придёться выйти за её приделы. Но обо всём по порядку. Кроме того разработчики сделали геоданные в игре, которые отслеживают ваше реальное местоположение по IP. Какая погода и время суток у вас за окном, такая и в игре (ну кроме зимы конечно). 
Гейм-дизайнерам можно сказать огромное спасибо, они на столько проработали каждый уровень, что они не похожи друг на друга. Здесь нет копипаста, видно что они продумали каждую деталь и как это будет смотреться на уровне. Они так хорошо передали стиль начала и середины XX века, что хочеться подольше побыть на каждом уровне и по лучше рассмотреть внутренние убранство. Графика не чем не примечательна для платформера, но если бы её постарались сделать в угоду нашему времени, то она просто потеряла бы весь шарм. Музыка заслуживает того чтобы о ней упомянуть. Очень хорошо подобраны композиции, тут треки как с приключенческими мотивами, так и во влекающие тебя в погружение тайн и загадок.

Мистика и тайны игры заслуживают отдельного абзаца. Продвигаясь всё дальше по уровням, вам будут попадаться подсказки и чтобы разгадать очередную тайну, нужно будет находиться на определённом уровне, в определённую фазу луны, которая как я уже говорил, напрямую зависит от сегодняшней даты. Можно конечно всегда перевести время на компьютере, но это будет уже не так интересно, как дождаться этой самой фазы. Для любителей полностью погрузиться в мистику связанную с особняком, разработчики подготовили сайт, название которого вы должны будете отыскать в игре. Перейдя на сайт вы сможете ознакомиться с документами, реально существовавшего тайного общества, а так же узнаете историю особняка и связанные с ним тайны. В этих документах вы найдёте ответы на многие вопросы и получите ключи к получению секретных достижений. Известно, те кто разгадал эти загадки были удивленны тому, что они узнали и в последствии  удалили всю информацию на форумах.

Немного о технической стороне игры и управлении: У меня за всю игру, а наиграл я не мало, не было ни одного бага или проблемы. Игра не вылетала и показала себя исключительно с лучшей стороны. Что же касается управления, оно очень удобное и не вызывало у меня трудностей. Также есть поддержка геймпада, так что вы всегда сможете откинуться на диване и просто расслабляться, играя в этот замечательный продукт игростроя.
Думаю после всего выше сказаного, пора подвести итоги.

Плюсы:
+ История/сюжет
+ Графика/стилистика
+ Музыка
+ Управление

Минусы:
- Их нет

Что мы имеем в сухом остатке:
Игру можно рекомендовать практически всем т.к. она получилась хорошая во всём, она подойдёт как для тех кто хочет просто провести хорошо время, получить новые ощущения, так и  для тех кто любит тайны и загадки. Игра также вышла на всех актуальных платформах, включая мобильные устройства, выбор где приобрести остаётся за вами. Ценник у игры очень демократичный и ознакомиться с игрой может каждый. Даже если бы игра стоила чуть дороже, к покупке она обязательна.Такая игра должна находиться в коллекции геймера, знающего толк в играх. На последок хочу пожелать всей команде Tiger Style, удачи в будущих проектах, чтобы вы делали побольше таких уникальных игр.

Итог: 98/100  Рекомендую. | OMG, I'm a tiny spider.

As I'm catching different kind of flies, bugs and other insects I witness what happend in this old and spooky mansion. Catching bugs is cool (dofferent bugs needs different techniques), Revealing the story even cooler.

Not to mention that in-game weather changes according to that in your location (as the game says ""looking through your window"") - this is scary. Looking at the world through spider's lens is exciting!

Music is not good thou. It doesn't add anything to the game theme (neither to spider story nor mansion story)."

I really like the fact you can move your turrets, advancing the front and reorganizing your assault as needed. It's so satisfying to start surrounded and pushing through as your power grows. Extremely addictive, runs good, and doesn't burn up cpu resources. | I have over 2,000 games in my library, and this is the first time in a good ten years that a game has failed to launch correctly from the start. It’s absolutely scandalous to encounter a game that doesn’t support 4K screens and doesn’t function at all on Linux. 

I’ve taken a screenshot, which I’ve uploaded directly to my website for you to see: [https://www.olivierpons.fr/download/creeper-world-3-2025-02-09-19h55m38s.png](https://www.olivierpons.fr/download/creeper-world-3-2025-02-09-19h55m38s.png). When you launch the game and move the mouse over the menu, the fonts are embarrassingly small—so much so that it’s almost ridiculous and reflects poorly on the developers. 

How is it possible in 2025 to release a game that doesn’t even start up correctly? As someone who has developed a Unity game myself, I’m in a strong position to critique this, as I know exactly what I’m talking about. Adapting to different screen resolutions is one of the most basic aspects of game development. This is simply unacceptable.

I might consider giving a positive review if the font issues are resolved and the game runs properly on Linux. 

The developers claim it’s Linux-compatible, but it’s clear they haven’t tested it thoroughly. The latest version doesn’t work at all on Linux, and I’ve even read on forums that to get it running correctly, you need to revert to a previous version. There’s an entire set of steps required to downgrade and make it functional. It’s baffling that they can label it as “compatible” when it clearly isn’t. This lack of testing on the platform is inexcusable.

While I’ve focused a lot on the Linux issue, the core problem, as shown in my screenshot, is the incredibly small fonts on 4K screens. This suggests one of two things: either they don’t test on 4K screens—which is inconceivable in 2025—or they simply can’t be bothered to optimize the display for high-resolution screens. Either way, it’s unacceptable. 

And to think this is called *Creeper World III*, implying it’s the third iteration of the game. I can’t even imagine what the previous versions must have been like! | Good Game. It is a good concept and has good gameplay.

Oynanış sıra tabanlı, klasik olarak bir saldırı yapacağınızda size bir % oranı veriyor ve bu orana göre vurup vurmama ihtimaliniz belirleniyor. Tabii ki karakterlerin yeteneklerine ve kullandıkları silahlara göre bu oran değişiklik gösteriyor bu yüzden bunlara göre ayarlayıp oynamalısınız. Bunun haricinde bomba, füze gibi şeyler kullanabiliyorsunuz. Ama tabii ki bunların vurma oranı yok bu yüzden kullandığınızda kesinlikle hasar veriyorlar. Karakterlerin her birinin yeteneklerine göre değişiklik gösteren enerjileri var. Bu yüzden her sıra size döndüğünde tek vuruş yapmaya yetecek kadar enerjiniz olacak. Onun için sizin dövüşü kazanmanıza en çok yardımcı olacak rakibe saldırmanız gerekli. Ayrıca tavsiyem ağır silahlar kullanmayın, çünkü vurma ihtimalleri diğer silahlara göre daha düşük ve daha fazla mermi harcıyorlar. Çorak topraklarda bulabildiğiniz her mermi değerli olacak ve en iyi şekilde değerlendirmeniz gerekecek. Kendi adıma en çok sinirlendiğim kısım vurma oranı %80 gibi yüksek oranları gösterse de çoğu zaman saldırıları ıskalamak oldu.

Bu sayede aynı mermiyi kullanmak zorunda kalmayacaksınız ve daha efektif dövüşler yapabileceksiniz. Ama karakterlerinize Hayvan Dili gibi hiçbir işe yaramayacak yetenekler vermemeye çalışın çünkü işe yaramayacaklar. 

Her RPG oyununda olduğu gibi bu oyunda da seçimler ile oyunun sonunu veya olayların gidişatını değiştiriyorsunuz. Bu yüzden ona göre hareket edebilirsiniz. Ve bazı görevlerde ne yaparsanız yapın iyi sona ulaşmak mümkün olmayabilir, işin güzelliği de burda. Hikayeye gelirsek oyunda Çöl Muhafızları denilen bir askeri birliğin üyesiyiz ve onlar için çalışıyoruz. Verdikleri görevleri yerine getiriyoruz ve ya getirmiyoruz, size kalmış. Oyunun birden fazla sonu var ve emin olun hepsi sizi tatmin edecektir. 

Son olarak oyunun incelemelerine baktığımda olumsuz yazıların hepsinin Türkçe dil ile ilgili olduğunu gördüm. Aslında komik çünkü Steam'de Türkçe dil desteği var yazmasına rağmen oyun içinde olmadığını söylemişler. Bu kısmen yanlış çünkü oyunu satın aldığınızda size 2 tane oyun veriyor biri ''Wasteland 2'' diğeri ise ''Wasteland 2: Director's Cut'' evet Wasteland 2 olan versiyonda Türkçe yok ama diğer Director's Cut sürümünü indirirseniz Türkçe dil onun içinde. İki oyun arasındaki fark ne diye sorarsanız herhangi bir fark olduğunu düşünmüyorum, ikisi de hemen hemen aynı oyun. O yüzden olumsuz vermeden önce insanlar biraz araştırmalı ve yargısız infaz yapmamalı. 

Her neyse oyun kesinlikle pişman etmeyecek türden bir RPG. İndirimde 3,74 dolara kadar düşüyor. Bu fiyata bu oyun bedava sayılır. 40 saatlik bir oyun süresini garanti edebilirim. Ayrıca incelemede 4 saat gözüktüğüne bakmayın, o saat Wasteland 2 oyunundaki saatimi gösteriyor yani içinde Türkçe dil olmayan sürümü. Director's Cut sürümünde 80 saatim var. | I have played this for 28 hours and decided not to continue. It's just too sloggish. I have completed Wasteland 3, and was told Wasteland 2 has better stories and decision. That may be true, but the quality of life os Wasteland 2 is too poor in comparison to Wasteland 3. I'll just replay Wasteland 3. | Having played for years across many platforms I still love this game | bastante bueno"

As the spiritual successor to the original Wasteland (and granddaddy of Fallout), it delivers deep turn-based combat, tough moral choices, and a world that reacts to your every decision—sometimes in hilariously brutal ways.

The game’s writing is sharp, filled with dark humor, strange factions, and quests that rarely have a clear “right” answer. Squad customization is top-notch, letting you build a team of Desert Rangers suited for diplomacy, hacking, or just good old-fashioned shootouts. Every bullet counts, every decision matters, and the wasteland never plays fair.

Sure, it’s tough, a little clunky at times, and doesn’t hold your hand—but for fans of classic CRPGs, Wasteland 2 is a must-play. Just remember: save often, and never underestimate a guy with a sawed-off shotgun. | Liked the gameplay and the combat very much

I've been with the game since launch, and it has managed to get better basically every year.  The game has always been pretty fun, though a little quirky early on.

[quote][i]Всем привет. Автор не несет ответственности за причиненный вред своими обзорами. Любое сходство с другими обзорами случайно. Данный обзор является лишь мнением автора и вы можете всегда оставаться при своем мнении! Спасибо за понимание и приятной игры![/i][/quote]

[h1]Описание:[/h1]
[i][b]Stellaris[/b] — это смесь грандиозной 4X-стратегии, ролевой игры и интерактивного романа, где вы сами пишете историю своего народа среди звёзд. Разработчики создали  эпическое повествование о взлётах и падениях цивилизации. От первых робких шагов в космосе до управления межгалактической империей — здесь есть место всему: дипломатии, войнам, предательствам и открытиям, которые перевернут ваше представление о жанре.[/i]

[b]Основа игры: Механики, которые затягивают на сотни часов[/b]
[i][list]
[*] [b]Создание своей цивилизации:[/b] Stellaris начинается с того, что вы буквально конструируете расу из десятков параметров: этика (милитаристы, пацифисты, ксенофобы), тип общества (биологическое, роботы, псионики), черты (адаптивность, интеллект, агрессия) и даже внешность. Хотите играть за миролюбивых космических слизней, строящих галактическую федерацию? Или за машинную империю, стремящуюся ассимилировать все органические расы? Здесь возможно всё.

[*] [b]Исследование и открытия:[/b] Галактика в Stellaris генерируется случайно, и каждое новое игра — это путешествие в неизвестность. Вы будете:
- Исследовать аномалии (например, древние руины или гравитационные аномалии).
- Встречать кризисы (вторжение внегалактических захватчиков, восстание синтетиков).
- Заключать союзы или уничтожать соседей.

[*] [b]Дипломатия и войны:[/b] 
- Дипломатия: От торговых соглашений до создания федераций — здесь можно решать судьбы галактики без единого выстрела.
- Войны: Система военных целей позволяет вести не тотальные войны, а конфликты с чёткими задачами (захват системы, освобождение вассала).
- Шпионаж и провокации: Саботаж, кража технологий, поддержка повстанцев — идеально для любителей «тихих» конфликтов.

[*] [b]Экономика и управление:[/b] 
- Балансировка ресурсов (энергия, минералы, пища, потребительские товары) — основа процветания.
- Планирование заселения планет, строительство мегасооружений (кольцевые миры, сферы Дайсона) и управление населением с уникальными потребностями.
[/list][/i]

[i][b]Сильные стороны: Почему Stellaris покоряет сердца[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]Нарративная глубина:[/b] События в игре — это не просто текст, а истории с последствиями. Например, обнаружение «Храмового комплекса» может привести к пробуждению древнего бога-червя, который переформатирует вашу расу, или к гибели всего живого в секторе.

[*] [b]Реиграбельность:[/b] Благодаря случайной генерации галактики, сотням событий и возможности создавать уникальные цивилизации, каждая партия кардинально отличается от предыдущей.

[*] [b]Моддерская поддержка:[/b] Stellaris обладает одной из самых активных моддерских сообществ. Моды добавляют новые расы, сюжеты, механики и даже полностью меняют сеттинг.

[*] [b]Постоянное развитие:[/b] Paradox регулярно обновляет игру, исправляя ошибки и добавляя новые фичи. Даже спустя 7 лет после релиза Stellaris остаётся актуальной.
[/list][/i]

[h1]Плюсы:[/h1]
[i][list]
[*] [b]Беспрецедентная свобода творчества:[/b] Создавайте уникальные расы с собственной этикой, чертами и историей. Хотите играть за пацифистов-грибов или машин-уничтожителей? Всё возможно. Проработанная система происхождений (например, «Потерянная колония» или «Синтетическая эволюция») задаёт тон всей партии.

[*] [b]Нарративная глубина:[/b] Сотни случайных событий, археологических цепочек и кризисов превращают игру в космическую сагу. Истории в духе научной фантастики: от восстания ИИ до встречи с божественными червями.

[*] [b]Реиграбельность:[/b] Случайная генерация галактики, разные типы кризисов (вторжение Пожирателей, Восстание машин) и бесконечные комбинации рас обеспечивают уникальность каждой партии.

[*] [b]Дипломатия и взаимодействие:[/b] От создания федераций до подрывных операций — здесь есть инструменты для любой стратегии. Возможность играть без войн, побеждая через культурное доминирование или политические интриги.

[*] [b]Моддерская поддержка:[/b] Огромная библиотека модов: от новых рас и кораблей до полных переработок вселенной (например, «Star Trek» или «Warhammer 40K»).

[*] [b]Атмосферность:[/b] Эпичный саундтрек, стилистика кораблей и планет, голосовые оповещения — всё это погружает в атмосферу живой галактики.

[*] [b]Постоянное развитие:[/b] Paradox регулярно обновляет игру, добавляя новые механики и исправляя ошибки.

[*] [b]Достижения:[/b] Присутствие получения различных достижений, что добавляет элемент соревновательности и мотивации с другими игроками которые смогли получить сложные достижения с особыми условиями.

[*] [b]Коллекционные предметы:[/b] Присутствуют обои, смайлики, карточки из которых можно скрафтить значки
[/list][/i]

[h1]Минусы:[/h1]
[i][list]
[*] [b]Высокий порог вхождения:[/b] Десятки ресурсов, технологий и механик могут перегрузить новичков. Обучение в игре поверхностное.

[*] [b]Проблемы с оптимизацией:[/b] На поздних стадиях игра начинает лагать, особенно в больших галактиках. Мультиплеер часто страдает от десинхронизации.

[*] [b]Дисбаланс механик:[/b] Некоторые стратегии (например, спам роботами или «танкирование» инфляции) остаются неоправданно сильными. ИИ часто действует нелогично: мирные империи внезапно объявляют войны, а ксенофобы предлагают союзы.

[*] [b]Повторяемость:[/b] После 100+ часов цепочки событий и диалоги начинают повторяться. Кризисы следуют одним и тем же сценариям.

[*] [b]Зависимость от DLC:[/b] Без дополнений (например, Utopia или Apocalypse) игра ощущается неполной. Многие «крутые» фичи (кольцевые миры, титаны) locked за платными DLC.

[*] [b]Ограниченная роль личности:[/b] Лидеры и фракции слабо влияют на игру. Их смерть или смена редко меняют курс империи.
[/list][/i]

[h1]Заключение:[/h1]
[i]Stellaris — это не просто игра. Это симулятор бесконечности, где каждая звезда может стать домом для новой цивилизации, а каждый чёрный ящик — хранить секреты, способные изменить галактику. Да, здесь есть проблемы с балансом и оптимизацией, но когда ваш флот из тысяч кораблей вступает в бой с внегалактическими захватчиками под эпичную музыку, вы понимаете: это не просто код и спрайты. Это — настоящее космическое приключение.[/i]

Всем добра, удачи и приятной игры! ^_^[/i] | Essentially a spreadsheet simulator in which you're just trying to make sure that you have the biggest or best numbers around. If you're meticulous and enjoy micromanaging, this is a great game to play. The mods for this game are also amazing! I highly recommend checking out the steam workshop for this game if you ever feel like vanilla starts to get kinda stale. And while this is my most played game, I DO NOT RECOMMEND GETTING THIS GAME FULL PRICE. Frequently this game goes on sale for like 75% and the base game alone is not worth the price tag especially as a lot of features that most Stellaris players like messing with are behind DLCs so unless there's some part of the game that you're desperate to play with I'd get the base game and any interesting DLC while they're on sale. | 肥肠好的游戏，使我的巨像旋转，之前玩的盗版，现在终于史低补票（仅本体）了，但P社的DLC是真贵，只能用学习版，等有钱了慢慢补票吧。 | So this is exactly the type of multiple month game time negative review that gets screen shot and memed on social media, but I'm sad to say I mean it in the most literal sense.  I have enjoyed much of my play time with Stellaris, but I emphatically don't recommend anyone purchase this game in it's current, maximum DLC form.
When this game launched, it was a refreshingly basic 4X. Most of the changes made in the early years all the way to the Nemesis expansion added meaningfully to the gameplay without making it overwhelming and complicated for new players.  Unfortunately recent patches and expansions have unfortunately been hats on hats, mostly adding complexity without adding fun.  I have enjoyed the ride for the most part, but like most Paradox games the continual addition of DLC eventually replaces the game you loved with something you barely recognize while draining your wallet."

Оценка:12/10 Лучшая экскурсия в облачный ад. | ""BioShock Infinite"" is a remarkable game that combines intense action with thought-provoking narrative and stunning world-building. Released in 2013 by Irrational Games, it builds upon the success of its predecessors while delivering a fresh, yet familiar experience. Set in the floating city of Columbia, the game introduces players to Booker DeWitt, a man tasked with rescuing a mysterious girl named Elizabeth. As the story unfolds, players are thrust into a world of political intrigue, social unrest, and philosophical exploration, with themes ranging from American exceptionalism to the nature of reality itself.

One of the standout features of ""BioShock Infinite"" is its narrative complexity. The plot takes unexpected twists, keeping players on their toes as they navigate the layers of conspiracy and mystery. Booker and Elizabeth’s relationship evolves in a compelling way, and their dynamic drives much of the emotional weight of the story. Elizabeth herself is a unique character, not only because of her abilities—such as opening ""tears"" in space-time—but also because of her depth and growth throughout the game. The bond between Booker and Elizabeth becomes central to the experience, and the way the game unfolds keeps the player invested in their journey.

The world of Columbia is incredibly well-crafted, with vibrant, meticulously detailed environments that stand in stark contrast to the darker themes of the game. The floating city feels like a living, breathing entity, with its own history, culture, and class divides. The design of Columbia, from its patriotic aesthetic to its underlying dystopian nature, provides a striking commentary on American society and the consequences of unchecked nationalism. The game's use of music, especially the incorporation of old-timey renditions of modern songs, further enhances the atmosphere and immersion.

Gameplay-wise, ""BioShock Infinite"" is engaging and intense. The shooting mechanics are fluid, and the introduction of the Skyhook, which allows players to move across railways in the air, adds a unique verticality to the combat. The combination of gunplay, strategic use of Vigors (special powers), and Elizabeth’s ability to open tears creates a dynamic combat system that requires both quick reflexes and tactical thinking. The game encourages exploration, rewarding players with lore, upgrades, and narrative elements that deepen the story.

However, it’s not just the gameplay and world-building that make ""BioShock Infinite"" stand out; it’s also the philosophical depth. The game delves into complex topics like free will, the multiverse theory, and the nature of identity. It challenges players to think critically about the choices they make in the game and how those choices relate to broader existential questions. The ending, in particular, leaves a lasting impact, providing both a satisfying conclusion and a thought-provoking meditation on fate and the consequences of one’s actions.

""BioShock Infinite"" is a masterpiece that blends excellent gameplay with a deep, engaging story. Its themes of freedom, oppression, and the complexity of human nature are explored in a way that feels both personal and universal. The game’s vibrant world, memorable characters, and intricate narrative make it one of the most thought-provoking and visually stunning games of its generation. While it may not appeal to every player, those who appreciate a game that challenges both the mind and the skills will find ""BioShock Infinite"" to be an unforgettable experience.

There's really nothing special about the two main parts of the game being combat and the story.

Only time where I really enjoyed playing is one section with multiple extended combat encounters where I had to plan out a strategy and ration my consumable items. Not sure if it was scripted or a random chance on doing a mission but I ended up getting a surprise combat after I believed everything was finished.

The hacking ""decking"" mechanic is a complete waste of time and consists of even worse combat just to use cameras for vision where it doesn't matter or turrets in areas where no enemies go. It also uses turns in combat so you're missing a fourth party member just to do it.
The Shaman class is one that I want to like but can't because of your summons have a chance to escape and turn on you every turn with increasing chances. I love the idea of support classes in general, but even its haste buff feels underwhelming. The range on the starting Shaman NPC's damage reduction aoe is also so short that there's no point in using it. 

The story isn't great either. A good majority of your supporting characters either do not like you or do not trust you which leads you to pry scraps and pieces of information from them over time. You're also mostly doing a bunch of disjointed side missions ranging from mildly interesting to a waste of time that makes you dislike your party members even more because they disapproved of you doing the morally right thing or doing anything risky. All of this is sometimes broken up by story exposition that goes on for too long and does not result in anything except your team's information broker saying that he'll look into it. | A good CRPG for its modest budget. Liked the companions and the main story while taking some predictable turns remained enjoyable for the most part, seems like there is a decent variety of outcomes, will probably replay it with couple more builds to see how things play out with different choices and I want to see what passing some skillchecks does, unlike modern CRPGs you can't use party members to pass them, gotta do most of them yourself. There is definitely an intent for you to play some specific builds like INT with high biotech skill. Can't say for sure that all build options are equally interesting and rewarding but a rather simpleminded ""All points in Quickness"" basic gunslinger with just enough Charisma to get two etiquettes: corporate and shadowrunner, still was satisfying on the first playthrough. Just don't take Socialite, seen like one etiquette check involving it through the whole game and it was just for a bit extra money, stick to something like Security or Academic instead.

On an additional note, I couldn't help finding the epilogue of the main story a bit underwhelming. You make the final choice, go back to your home, talk about it with your crew and then get a bit of extra context on what transpired and what's gonna happen from couple very important (in a setting, not narrative, that is) NPCs before getting a text epilogue that tells about the several events in the future, some of them probably an outcome of your decisions throughout the game. And that's it. I guess the underwhelming part is a natural outcome of the narrative framing, you get dragged into this deadly grand mystery and resolving it is the only way to survive but you don't really have any other motivation, at best to avenge an NPC who dies in the prologue and another NPC who dies in the middle of the game. So while your involvement is narratively justified, the personal stakes you and your companions have don't feel interesting?  No matter how well you furnish it with dialogues ""Phew, that was quite something. Glad we survived. What do we do now?"" is still something lacking oomph, at least for me. | DragonFall Nails it.

From the tone of the world, to the depth and nuance of the characters you encounter the writing in this game walks the line of ""in world"" conversations while not verging into the valley of cringe that is easy to slip into. 

This entry has just enough beats to satisfy, challenging fun combat and options to make it your own.  

this is an instant key entry to the genre. I will be stealing characters and setting elements for my live game | Loved this. I slept on the SR series for years, picked this up mostly for research, and found a lot of unexpectedly interesting design and narrative decisions. It's hard to pick one thing that SR:DF does unusually well, but the ambience, systems, narrative, writing, art never fall below 'very good' and they work together harmoniously. And of course it's really faithful to the original IP if you were there for that in the early TRPG days, so if you're here for nostalgia, fill yer boots.

Really sad when it finished - glad I have SRHK to go on to. | Good story and game play. I wish there was more combat and opportunities for conflicts."

The game is just missing the sound effect and music sliders the original game had, which I would have forgiven if they at least gave a slider to mute the story narration.

They also removed half of the ""hardest puzzle in the game"" (there is an achievement), and the half they removed was the hard part. Most of the puzzles are easy and a few take just a little bit of thinking.

[h1] 	Гра ""Метро 2033"" - це така собі небувальщина про сучасних росіян у реаліях 2033 року, які навіть після ядерного апокаліпсиса, не змінилися ні на йоту, ненавидячи усіх хто живе краще хоч на краплинку. Уявіть собі, живуть вони в підземеллях московського метро, наче щури, бояться вийти на поверхню, радіація і мутанти як величезні бабайки цього світу. Але, давайте чесно, хіба не самі росіяни стали для себе найбільшою загрозою та ворогом, що звик знищувати собі подібних, заново винайшовши фанатизм, диктаторські режими, рабовласницький стрій, та любов до засекречення усього. А в результаті, як виявилося, людянішими та кращими персонажами за всіх, є мутанти, що розвинутіші, розумніші, що не доведено, бо намагання встановити перемир’я або союз з росіянами, закінчується, завжди погано, а ці розумні істоти цього при знайомстві не побачили.

Одного разу вони з другом відкрили браму і впустили багацько монстрів, браму вже ніхто не закрив, друг загинув, Артем утік, метро перетворилося на м'ясний супермаркет для потвор іззовні.

Але улюбленою розвагою головного героя, були прогулянки, гра на гітарі (грати не умів, але була та й усе), збирати книжки Глуховського-хоча читати не любив, зате вів щоденник (автори чому він вів його літературною чистою мовою, як згенерований ШІ персонаж, а де реальність, ви ж чули російську мову?).

Я был наслышан о серии Метро, но сам пытался только поиграть в первую часть, когда её раздавали, но мой ноутбук был не готов к той игре, и пришлось отложить данный продукт до лучших времён. 
Но вот теперь, когда у меня есть относительно мощный ПеКа, я уже купил весь бандл с Метро и начинаю погружаться в эту вселенную.

Игра тащит за счёт визуала, который как минимум в версии 2014 года просто превосходный! При первом прохождении реально с открытым ртом на всё это смотрел. Шейдеры тут прям конечно адски жрут производительность, и в некоторых сценах, может проседать ФПС, а я напомню... RTX 3060! Нехилая такая штука, которая должна рвать релиз 11-летний давности, но увы. Справедливости ради, происходит это не часто, и это не мешает играть, однако очень заметно когда появляется. 

Также меня очень порадовал геймплей! Играл я на нормальном уровне сложности, и скажу так: лута хватает с головой и в конце игры прям очень много ресурсов остаётся. Планирую пройти оригинальную версию 2010 года уже на хардкоре, чтобы проверить как там обстоят дела, но я слышал что там тайников нет, поэтому думаю что будет сложнее...
Стрельба выполнена на высшем уровне, пушки разные, и у каждой есть как и плюсы, так и минусы... Несколько видов гранат, нож, ещё нужно следить за маской, когда появляется радиация, подзаряжать фонарь и в купе получается прям базированный шутан. Стелс в игре не особо интересный, очень узко и враги тебя могут не заметить в открытую, поэтому мне больше понравилось стрелять (хотя прошёл на обе концовки, поэтому и по стелсу тоже успел пройти игру). Система морали тут реально иногда странная, но вроде не должно быть проблем быть хорошим парнем.
Ещё мне нравиться, что игра реально иногда держит в напряжении и в мрачной атмосфере, ты не можешь понять где бегают мутанты и иногда реально пугаешься их, прям реально хоррор. А постановка в некоторых моментах, прям вообще отвал головы! Прям Atomic Heart напомнило)

Сюжет же, не сказал бы что очень интересен, но персонажи колоритны и с ними интересно взаимодейсьвовать и слушать) Постановка в некоторых моментах прям очень странная за счёт того, что наш персонаж немой. Честно, не сказал бы что игре это идёт на пользу, особенно странно осознавать, что вне нашего внимания он разговаривает. А персонажи когда к нему обращаются, он же их просто игнорит! Как они его понимают? В общем, халв лайф скосплеить не удалось)

Как итог, хороший линейный шутан, прям реально один из лучших, что я трогал! Тем более в сеттинге России, ну прям реально БАЗА! Есть некоторые странности и шероховатости, но это не страшно, так как играть в неё очень интересно!

Финальная оценка: 8/10 | The survival horror genre has started a number of recognizable gameplay traditions. The constant tension, the emphasis on atmosphere, the helplessness of the main character, limited items/ammo -- all of these mechanics are among the reasons why survival horror games are so enticing. Metro 2033 is a first-person shooter that borrows heavily from these traditions in order to create an atmospheric experience. Although Metro 2033 is an intriguing journey, I was terribly frustrated by a number of stealth scenarios and technical glitches.

Based on a Russian novel by Dmitry Glukhovsky, Metro 2033 is set in post-apocalyptic Moscow. After nuclear devastation ravaged the earth and skies, the people of Moscow retreated into the sprawling underground Metro system in order to survive, building tattered towns at various stations throughout. The world is populated by mutants, dangerous anomalies and a number of supernatural occurrences. In the midst of this strange setting, players take control of the young Artyom and guide him on his quest to deliver an important message to a neighboring station. He'll fight a ton of generic enemies in order to get there, with a few surprises along the way.
 | [h1]优秀的游戏设计和叙事，却仍然掩盖不了其幼稚的反战反共，无政府主义思想 [/h1]

----------------------------------------------------------
      地铁的故事设定于第三次世界大战，人类使用了核武器导致地球环境被破坏，只有极少数人躲进了地铁之中才得以生存，游戏又在这里设计了三方人类势力，一个是红军，一个是纳粹，还是有一个被称为猎人的组织，而在这里，游戏制作组却又直白地暴露出他们近乎天真的政治思想
      在游戏里，无论是遇到纳粹还是红军，无一不是以贬低之笔法而示人，到了猎人组织却又一改其风格，描绘的万家灯火歌舞升平，虽贫穷但人人自得了，似乎一个具体的政治组织，远不如一个由官僚和士兵所建设起来的组织要好，可这能成为事实吗？

      让我们暂时先抛开什么共产什么战争，抛开一切的主义之分，先从最简单的分配上入手
无论是何时，为了生存，就一定需要食物，为了食物，就一定需要生产，而为了生产，就一定需要劳动，又因生产的无限需求，才会出现工具来帮助劳动
      但问题就在于，无论是进行食物生产的原材料（种子等等），还是帮助劳动的工具，都不可能做到人人都有，又或者，即使人人都有了，当生产变得愈发熟练之时，又会有多余的食物出现，对于这部分产品，由谁生产便由谁占有吗，或者由一人全部占有吗，这时又由谁来决定呢？即使能在一两件事情上达成个人的协议，那些不能达成协议的事情呢，或者国家的事情上呢？
      当人人都处在一个同样的经济地位之时，当没有一个处于超人地位的组织之时，当没有一个组织来领导个人去生产生活的时候，就必然出现这样的僵持的局面，只有由一个拥有权力的组织来决定的时候，才能打破这个僵局，将生产生活之必须之组织而毁灭，转由个人去解决其所不能解决之问题，这就是无政府主义所失败的必然原因

      只有组织业已存在，才有探讨其未来的组织形式，政治思想之可能，而只有解决了生产生活之必要问题之后，才有谈论政治之可能，只有解决经济问题，解决生存问题后，才有转而解决政治问题之可能，但如何解决经济问题，却从来不是一个纯经济问题，而常常包含着政治问题，[b][u]经济基础决定上层建筑，上层建筑反作用于经济基础[/u][/b]，这当然是真理，但如果把这条规律视为绝对的不可动摇的，必须完全遵循的死规矩，而忽视了政治在经济问题之中的领导作用，忽视了政治的灵活性，而把政治和经济当作是这样两种水火不容的，绝对独立的事物的时候，是一定会走向错误的道路的

      当政治制度领先与经济基础之时，我们应该怎么做？是在政治上开倒车，去强迫自己适应落后的经济基础，或者静静等待经济建设追上来，还是要继续加强政治建设，用先进的思想指导经济正确发展，减少或避免走弯路，从而达到两者相适应或减少差距的结果呢
      因此，无论是在什么时候，无论是末日还是和平，都不能放松政治建设哪怕一分一毫，否则就是在拖累整个社会进步的速度，也是在减慢经济发展的速度
      我们当然会在实际的实践中遇到问题，先进的分配制度无法承担落后的经济现实，过度的政治建设压抑了人民合理的自由等等，我们必须要正视这些问题，但绝不能因此就否定整个政治制度，只有当这样一个政治制度已经开始从根本上走弯路了的时候，才需要团结起来推翻它，在次要矛盾上走了错路，只要不是一意孤行，总是还有机会改正的

      一个社会存在一个问题，把它指出来当然是正确的，可如果为了各种目的，而把一个独立的事件写成一个普遍的事件，利用着信息差而蒙骗着其他人，这又是否是正确的呢？地铁正是用着这样的笔法来把红军和纳粹中所存在的问题给强调了出来，又用各种或自述或他述来让玩家感觉红军和纳粹一无是处，却丝毫不提猎人内部的问题，实际上，一个问题的存在，不单单是由政治制度而决定，就比如贪污问题，挂到社会主义国家可能有，挂到资本主义国家也可能有，挂到封建国家更可能有，把一个社会问题不加思辨就和社会制度而挂钩，归根到底还是要为了自己所希望的无政府主义唱赞歌
      同样的，《组织部来了个年轻人》这本书，不恰恰就是这种手法的代表作吗，把一个典型问题扩大化，让读者以为全中国上上下下都是这样一片的无边无际的黑暗，王蒙这种三流文人，怎么现在又不敢写一本这样的书了呢，难道我们现在就没有这样的问题了吗？当然不是，他写与不写，写什么与不写什么，归根结底也是为了他自己的利益而服务，并且是要把这种利益放在一个高于人民之利益的地方的，靠着吃过去的老本，拿着一两本书就想享受一辈子荣华富贵的人终究是要掉落下来的

      红军和纳粹，是一定要互相对立的，这是其指导思想上的互斥使然，如果我们来到一个虚构的社会，在这个社会里，红军和纳粹出现了一个共同的敌人，这时他们还应该要互相战斗吗？如果我们再抽象一点，当一个矛盾从主要矛盾变为次要矛盾，新的主要矛盾已经摆在我们眼前之时，我们是否还应该首先解决没解决完的次要矛盾，而忽视迫在眉睫的主要矛盾呢
地铁在这个问题上给出了很好的答案，却给出了错误的步骤，游戏借主角之口否定了红军和纳粹互相战斗的合理性，在游戏所虚构的环境中无疑是完全正确的，但却同时否定了意识形态战争的延长性和持续性，否定了战争之中双方的共同责任，这更无疑的暴露出游戏制作组天真的反战思想
      两个政治实体的战争，一定都出于某个具体的矛盾，如果这个矛盾通过战争得以解决，在没有新的矛盾出现以前是无论如何不会再有战争的，但如果这个矛盾双方是两个具体的意识形态，一方存在之基础是另一方的毁灭之时，这个矛盾是绝不会突然就消失了的，即使是战争也很难消灭它，因此才会出现冷战
      即使面对了一个第三方的新的敌人，旧的威胁也仍然没有清除，即使在此刻已处于次要地位的意识形态对立也仍然无时无刻威胁着自身的生存，在这样的情况下又怎么能强求一个政治实体抛弃自身的意识形态和另一个政治实体联合呢
      这当然不是不可能，国共合作就是最好的例子，但要促成这样的结局就需要有一方在或政治或经济或民心上占有优势，并可以承担被背叛的结果之时，才能又合作又斗争，共产党在当时顺应了全国人民合作抗战的呼声，并且是生擒了老蒋才逼迫他同意联合抗战，在地铁的世界观里，这样的事情又怎么可能发生呢，因此也就不可能出现两者联合起来的未来，这当然是一个悲哀的未来，但这不才是正常的未来吗，难道要抱着虚假的期盼来看待一切事物吗？这绝非希望主义，乐观主义，而只是不着边际的幻想而已，地铁正是在这里犯了这样的一个错误

      地铁描述了一个新的物种，一个超人类的新进化的物种，同时又设计了两种结局，一种是[spoiler] 好结局，主角把新物种视作进化的产物，并放弃攻打它们的聚集地 [/spoiler]，一种是[spoiler] 坏结局，主角仍然把它们视为敌人，选择用导弹让它们飞起来 [/spoiler]
      在这个问题上地铁做了很好的设计，即使放到现实，人类不再是最优势物种之后，我想我们也会有这两类人出现
      生物如何进化？从现在的生物进化来推导，未来的生物进化也一定要往大脑上走，也就是说，即使我们不再是生物链顶端的生物，新进化的生物也一定是一个有智慧的生物，这就为我们和它们之间的主动接触创造了可能，但即使它们不再是智慧生物，人类从生存中寻找规律，寻找经验，并最终实现共处的可能性也依然存在
----------------------------------------------------------

      但地铁依然讲述了一个在危难中人人自危，却仍努力生存互帮互助的故事，这样的精神无论是在虚拟的世界还是在现实都是必要的，是必不可少的
      从游戏上说，现在的版本作为重置版，画面虽然经过更新，但依然看起来非常模糊，打开HDR后还会有过曝的现象，垂直同步也有BUG，打开后反而会出现非常明显的画面撕裂
      对于射击方面，我是拿手柄同时用DSX模拟自适应扳机玩的，玩起来很爽
      总而言之，即使它有着我上述那些问题，但无论是想体验剧情还是射击还是潜行，还是一起体验一款剧情+PVE+PVP+潜行+割草的游戏，地铁都很适合你

进来一起玩游戏啊！ヾ(≧∇≦*)ゝ[/quote] | Metro 2033 Redux is a remastered version of the original Metro 2033, offering improved graphics, AI, and gameplay mechanics while preserving its intense survival horror atmosphere. Set in a post-apocalyptic Moscow where nuclear war has forced humanity underground, the game follows Artyom, a young survivor on a dangerous journey to warn others about the mysterious Dark Ones. The world is dark, eerie, and unforgiving, with claustrophobic metro tunnels filled with warring factions, horrifying mutants, and supernatural threats. The surface, though more open, is just as hostile due to radiation and deadly creatures.

The game excels in atmosphere, making players feel constantly vulnerable. Ammo is scarce, and bullets serve as both currency and a lifeline in combat. Every shot must be carefully considered, as supplies are limited. Gas masks are essential for survival on the surface, but filters run out quickly, adding another layer of tension. Unlike traditional shooters, Metro 2033 Redux encourages stealth and resource management, making every encounter meaningful.

The story is engaging, with a deep world full of morally complex choices. The metro is divided into factions like the Reich, the Red Line, and Hanza, each with its own ideology and conflicts. The game subtly presents ethical dilemmas, and your choices influence the ending. The improved AI and more refined controls in Redux make combat and exploration smoother while retaining the original’s survival horror elements. The game’s sound design is phenomenal, with haunting echoes, distant screams, and immersive voice acting that enhance the experience.

Metro 2033 Redux is more than just a shooter; it is an intense survival experience that demands patience, strategy, and immersion. Its gripping narrative, oppressive atmosphere, and unique mechanics make it a must-play for fans of deep, atmospheric games.

走过路过，不大的游戏在你浏览商店时都能下好。况且又免费，当你在油腻的大片级游戏中感到视觉疲劳时，何不来一发FP来舒爽一下神经。 | I don't get the ""overwhelmingly positive"" reviews for this game. It's not a terrible game, but it's not great either. The gameplay consists of using a grappling hook (really just a red line) to swing around in arcing trajectories in order to collide with some red bars. The levels consist of some randomly-placed grey boxes to which are attached red bars. The more bars you collide with (while avoiding collisions with the grey boxes), the higher your score. That's. . . basically the whole game. Pressing ""enter"" allows you to skip to the next level, but as far as I can tell all of the levels are pretty much exactly the same. Just randomly-placed boxes. There doesn't seem to be a clear objective to the game either, aside from simply getting a high score. There is no endgame as far as I can tell.

Honestly, this looks like a simple proof-of-concept prototype that could have been made in Unity in an afternoon. There's hardly any content and the gameplay gets boring after a few minutes. A point in the game's favour is that it's free, so I can't really complain about the price. If you're curious, you might as well download it and try it out for yourself.

I initially thought the girls all looked a bit similar but its quickly clear that each has a deliberately very different personaility from each other.  You get to be their hero - and why not.  I'll not say too much but the ending was good and leaves you wanting to buy the next game in the storyline - having saidf that, this one is plenty long enoufgh for a good enjoyable playthrough spo its not a cheap teaser so you buy the next, its a great game in its own right. | For a free game this is surprisinly high quality. The combat is challenging (if you want) and fun. The soundtrack also is beautiful and very fitting in many scenes, though there are a few were it doesnt mach the tone of the scene but only a few. Characters are interesting and quite likeable. Ships and ryders designs are very well done. Overall a must play for lovers of strategy games and space operas. | I downloaded this when it first came out, played for 17 minutes and then stopped for years. Then I was bored and decided to play it again. I had a great time. What an intense ending.

The art is poor, though to be fair this is a free indie game. There's not many event CGs and most of the times you just have a background and characters in their standard standing position behind the dialogue screen, whose speaker is hard to follow because the name and the dialogue are separated so far apart. If they changed the dialogue box color for each character, like brown for Ava and red for Asaga, it would have been much better.

The gameplay is... laggy? The attack animation is very basic and takes quite long, and I skipped them a lot, but there's no transition or anything. When you click to skip an animation, the screen pauses for a second and then you're already on the next phase. There's no sliding to close the scene or screen fading out to black and opens up to the next scene. This is particularly annoying during the enemy's turn as you may want to skip a lot of enemy's animation.

The voice actors are alright. The dialogues aren't voiced and they only speak a few lines during battle. I especially like Ava's voice actor, but Icari's out-of-nowhere tsundere lines are simply horrible.

So why did I give a thumbs up? It's the well-written story. The conflict the main character is having actually feels rough, heavy and difficult. It's not a story about choosing which girl to date or anything cheap like that. It's about what kind of leader you want to be. You have a ship to protect. Your morals and professionalism are crossing each other, and the romance just makes it even harder. I only care for one of the girls, but maybe that's just me being me rather than the other romance being poorly written. The story builds up to an AMAZING ending, I'm telling you.

I won't spoil anything, but GOD DAMN I'm glad I chose the right option (for me) on that final choice. IT'S SO GOOD! | Oh well, I downloaded this one for the waifus, but, surprisingly enough, I found the gameplay part to be quite immersive and challenging, if a bit unpolished. The plot is your standard space opera...with battle spacefaring waifus (too bad there's no real way to pursue a romantic relationship with one of them - the plot is more or less linear in this department). As for the production values, they aren't anything special, but more than adequate for a free game. Overall, a solid experience which got me interested in the pay-to-play sequel. | So for anime fans its fair, but for people that actually want good gameplay its pathetic. There are limited choices to make in the storyline and the battles, which are the majority of the game, are pathetically designed.

The difficulty settings say the default is the way the game is designed to be played, great but i like harder challenges. So I played on hard... well the SECOND mission it is not possible to surivive until TURN 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! with simple luck, and getting that luck seems to be about a 50/50 chance.

because it is only the second mission means there are no particular stategies you can do to survive longer, it comes down to nothing other than iff the enemy hits you or misses on their turns. So what is the point of this? it's utterly pathetically broken as strategic combat."
76561198192893105,314330,DROD: Gunthro and the Epic Blunder,3.9833333333333334,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy",2,"Друзья. Я играю в эту игру года четыре, и, пожалуй, это моя любимая игра в Стиме. Это одна из тех игр в которые можно углубиться бесконечно, увидеть бесконечность сюжетов и техник, примерно как в Селесту (с тех пор как у неё появилось моддерское сообщество) или The Binding Of Isaac. Мне странно, что она не захватила мир; я думаю она вызывает привыкание у довольно узкого круга головоломщиков, куда я, однако, попал.

Итак, вся (!) игра состоит из схематичных двумерных комнат, в которых пошагово нужно убить всех врагов. Это, может быть, самую малость стратегия, но по большей части всё-таки головоломка, и бой здесь ведётся в первую очередь не с врагами, а с архитектурой. Из разряда ""какая разница, что твой враг не умеет двигаться, если тебе нужно решить NP-полную задачу просто чтобы до него добраться?"" Куча элементов, в основном врагов, но также кнопок, дверей, платформ, собираются в очень красивые математические задачи, сродни шахматным этюдам, которые приходится разбирать и искать решения. Мне - очень нравится.

Вокруг всего этого построен сюжет пяти (!) игр. Gunthro and the Epic Blunder - это четвёртая игра в серии, но начинать нужно с неё. Она самая простая, она никак не привязана к основному сюжету - потому что она приквел - но при этом в ней уже есть некоторая свобода сюжета и более, что ли, весёлые механики. В качестве платных DLC к ней продаются первые три части, и там действие почти целиком проходит под землёй, что как будто бы поскучнее.

А этот сюжет... Ну, наверное, я распишу сюжет основных частей в обзорах к ним? Сюжет четвёртой части прост как сюжет второй части Ведьмака - типичный охотник на чудовищ решил помочь местным политикам в улаживании Великой Войны, и раз за разом единолично справляется то с монстрами, то с полчищами Туэнских стражников, то ещё с чем-то. Плюс в игре есть два огромных секретных уровня для тех кому мало. В лор вселенной погружаться особо не приходится - но если начнёте покупать другие части, то...

Глубина мира игры здесь почище чем у Dark Souls, и материала для его изучения - вагон и маленькая тележка. 5 частей игры (5-ая продаётся отдельной игрой в Стиме, если что), плюс 25 модов, которые были выделены разрабамы в платные сюжеты и озвучены. Если вам понравится эта игра, то готовьте сотни часов на то чтобы познать все извращённые глубины архитектуры. Это... очень круто. Сложно описать, проще попробовать.

P.S: Хотя чего я понтуюсь, я потратил почти 300 часов на то чтобы 100%-нуть все 4 части. Правда, мне осталось ещё штук 5 ""испытаний"" (а, я не говорил? Ачивки здесь называются ""испытаниями"" и они - все до единого - очень приятные, хотя многие ужасно сложные), но всё же, 300 часов на 4 части это не масштаб истинных задротов рогаликов, например.

P.P.S: И это не считая того, что я много проиграл в моды. | Absolutely disgusting amount of gameplay even before you get into the fan-made levels.

76561198192893105,316790,Grim Fandango Remastered,0.0,Adventure,0,"One of those games that actually feels like an adventure. Visually, this is probably the coolest game I have ever played. The early 3d backgrounds and environments are extremely atmospheric which makes every new screen and area enjoyable to  simply walk around in. The puzzles in this game are normally really clever and cool, each one being able to be figured out with only a little bit of trial and error. This game is also really funny, most of the old Lucasarts games are. All in all a goated game for people that walk around life and look at everything all the time. | You know when you find an old film noir movie on telly at 3 AM, and you think 'this looks ancient, I'll give it five minutes,' then suddenly it's morning and you've watched the whole thing? That's what playing Grim Fandango Remastered is like. Except everyone's dead and speaking in puns. Brilliant.

I first played this back in '98 when I was probably wearing something embarrassing and had questionable hair. But unlike my fashion choices from that era, this game has aged like a fine wine - well, mostly. The writing's as sharp as a comedian doing their best material at the Apollo. The dialogue's got more wit than a room full of Oscar Wilde types at a cocktail party. And the story? Imagine if Raymond Chandler wrote a noir detective story, but everyone's a skeleton, and it's set in the Mexican Land of the Dead. Mental, innit?

The music's this gorgeous love child between a smoky jazz club and a Mexican fiesta - absolutely brilliant stuff. The characters stick in your mind like that awkward conversation you had with your boss at the Christmas party. You've got more personality in this bunch of skeletal misfits than you'd find in the entire cast of most modern games - and they're literally just walking bones! There's our hero Manny Calavera, who's basically what you'd get if you crossed a travel agent with the Grim Reaper and gave him a sense of humor drier than the Sahara.

Now, let's address the elephant in the room - or should I say the pixelated skeleton? The remaster's like when you see an aging rock star who's had a bit of work done - the important bits look better, but you can still tell they're from the '90s. The backgrounds are about as high-res as my first mobile phone photo, and the 4:3 aspect ratio means you've got these black bars on the side like you're watching an old episode of Friends.

The puzzles? Some are proper head-scratchers. There were times I felt like I needed a PhD in skeleton logic to figure them out. Other times, the solution was so obvious, I wanted to give myself a slap. It's like when you lose your keys and spend 20 minutes looking for them, only to find they're in your hand - that kind of feeling.

But here's the thing - despite its wrinkles and gray hairs, Grim Fandango is still an absolute masterpiece. It's like that old pub that hasn't changed its decor since the 70s but serves the best Sunday roast in town.

If you're wondering whether to pick it up, let me put it this way: If you can handle graphics that make Minecraft look like a 4K nature documentary, and you're not the type to throw a wobbly over pixels the size of your dad's garden shed, then for god's sake, play this game. Because under those chunky pixels is more charm than a con man at a pensioner's bingo night. And that's not just the nostalgia talking - though I have had a few drinks. | Excellent game! Fun puzzles, very beautiful, silly personal story, fantastic voice acting and music. Enjoyed every moment of it. | [h1]Grim Fandango: Your Destiny… is to Purchase this Game.[/h1]
Grim Fandango is a true gaming classic, and often touted as one of the greatest point & click games ever made, even if it was also the reaper that felled the genre. Although, like any old game, the bones this remaster is built on are a bit rough, this game is as eternal as a soul in the afterlife. Now it’s time for me to make like Manny and implore you to buy this game.

[b]Steam Deck Support:[/b]
I played it 90% docked, but with correct setup, the trackpads make this game easily playable, and it feels almost natural to play a point & click that way. I don’t think I need to comment on how well it runs.

Grim Fandango is a game that has been stuck with me since I played it as a kid, believing it was never going to hold a candle to the masterpiece that was Monkey Island. The game’s vibe was just so unique and its premise so wild, that my brain gave up trying to compartmentalise the experience, created a new core memory instead, then sat down for a drink. It’s hard to write an elevator pitch for what Grim fandango is: It’s a weird blend of cultures and ideas that draw from film noir, art deco and latin american folklore. Manny Calavera, a failing afterlife salesman for the DoD (Department of Death) is forced by his conscience into an unwitting adventure across the land of the dead, spanning multiple years.   

[h2]Four Years in Heaven[/h2]
Let me tell you about that vibe. People will quote Mirror’s Edge and Skyrim as examples of how art direction ages better than graphical fidelity, but in my mind Grim Fandango is the purest example of that. Remaster or not, this game looks as beautiful as the day it released.

A benefit of using a static image as each map is that it allows the creators to play with composition and lighting in a way that would normally be undermined by player control. Pre-rendered scenery also gives the devs better control over lighting, and here they have leveraged that opportunity to such an effect that it would make a ray tracing core blush. Often, I find point & click games don’t make enough use of this opportunity, but not Grim Fandango. The developers are constantly playing with camera angle and shot size, drawing inspiration from the same cinema the game constantly pays homage to. Examples abound: shots from Manny’s sleazy office building are reminiscent of CCTV footage, while those from lonely bars place you in the seat of a tired and nameless patron.

Film noir’s influence is hard at work making every scene as brooding and mysterious as possible, but there are other influences too. Grim Fandango somehow blends the grayscale of film noir with the explosive colour of a Mexican holiday in a way so natural that I just assumed the two were made for each other. Amongst all of these huge successes in creative direction, Grim Fandango’s [i]soundtrack[/i] manages to stand out. Like everything else in the game, the score is an eclectic mix of influences ranging from sombre mariachi, through Hitchcock-esque orchestra, to smoky jazz. It’s hard to write about how well the music works given it’s a medium I have scant knowledge of, but the impact here is certainly felt. Grim Fandango's score supercharges a game that is already dripping with atmosphere into something even modern games struggle to match. I do wish the music was blended a little better though: Songs restart every time you change screens, which means unless you stop to listen, a lot of ambient tracks won’t be heard all the way through. In particular, Manny’s demonic companion Glottis has a secret performance so good that I had to double check the voice actor wasn’t moonlighting as a blues vocalist. 

[h2]You Might as well Enjoy the Trip[/h2]
Of course, Grim Fandango’s story has aged like a bottle of Marillo de Oro. Manny starts out trying to sell the recently deceased tickets on the number 9 express to heaven. He then discovers the tickets, and the job that sells them, are part of a rabbit hole of corruption that goes so deep it plumbs the literal depths of the ocean. 
This is a story straight out of [i]Casablanca[/i], one sporting naïve heroes, sleazy salesmen, mob plots and [i]La Revolución[/i]. It would be boring if Grim Fandango didn’t tell the story so masterfully, and the recognisable tale being told gives the player an anchor of familiarity to cling to in an otherwise alien world.
Along with the story, Grim Fandango’s writing is just masterful in general. Tim Schafer’s razor wit adds a necessary level of playfulness to the otherwise serious story, much like the colours of [i]Día de los Muertos[/i] add life to the game’s otherwise shadowy aesthetic. As mentioned earlier, this game is so layered that it cuts across all ages without ever feeling like a sacrifice was made. As a kid, Glottis’s slapstick escapades had me rolling, while adult me is nearly in tears after accidentally forming a [spoiler]worker bee labour movement.[/spoiler]

Point & click gameplay often just amounts to puzzles, and even though these are the backbone of Grim Fandango’s gameplay, they’re also where the game tends to fall flat. The Puzzles relying on classic point & click design, notably all of part 2 are fantastic, if a little hard: one hilarious puzzle requires you to [spoiler]exploit glottis’ overindulgence in alcohol to force him to vomit a pool of liquid you can then freeze, disarming a devious domino-based trap[/spoiler] for example. Sadly Grim Fandango also has a lot of puzzles relying on its awkward proto-3D movement, possibly as an attempt to force the genre into a third dimension to keep up with the times. These puzzles, and the movement they are based on, are as obtuse as they are frustrating. The camera seems to arbitrarily switch perspectives, confusing your movement even further. Furthermore, Grim Fandango has an absolutely shocking number of timing-based puzzles, which are [i]never[/i] a good idea in point & click games. Luckily the game stopped short at causing me to rapidly deconstruct my keyboard, but the fact it got so close is something to be wary of.

The Land of the Dead as a concept is so well developed that it feels like the IP has been around for way longer than a single game. There are so many ideas and influences at every turn that I’m amazed its creators were able to contain them and prevent them from becoming overbearing. Some of my favourite ideas in particular are the use of fast-growing plants as weaponry, the “business scythes” used by the DoD, and the Aztec-inspired pyramid and gatekeeper serving as the final crossing to the underworld.
 
People throw the word “classic” around often enough that it has lost its true meaning. That said, if any game is a classic then Grim Fandango is, a classic that shines as an example of the heights a now much less prevalent genre once reached. Indeed, as good as Grim Fandango was, it was also a near commercial failure, and one of the reasons Lucasarts moved away from the genre. Grim Fandango is a ride on the Number 9 Express to point & click heaven, and so the only question left is whether you want to buy a ticket?

While the game excels in visuals and technical execution, it sacrifices the series' core identity: exploration and puzzles, in favor of relentless combat and excessive action sequences. The ""Shantytown"" section epitomizes this shift, forcing players into repetitive, nonsensical battles with hordes of enemies, completely sidelining the essence of discovery that defined the classic games.

The narrative also falls apart under basic scrutiny. For instance, the sheer number of fresh corpses, mummified remains, and skeletons scattered across the island suggests that it must have been the unfortunate destination of dozens—if not hundreds—of fully loaded cruise ships over decades! And let’s not forget the absurd logistics: how do you even feed and sustain an army of enemies that large on an isolated island? To top it off, aside from the mummified queen, there are no women in the cult that occupies the island, just an endless parade of men. It’s not only implausible but also a glaring failure in representation. Laughable.

For those seeking the intelligent exploration and challenging puzzles of the original series, this game may leave you frustrated and exhausted. If you're looking for an action-heavy adventure, it might suit your tastes, but fans of the classic Tomb Raider should approach with caution! | Juegazo al principio no le tenia mucha fe pero despues de jugar un rato descubri que es un juegazo el combate y la exploracion es buenisimo y todos los coleccionables y  mejoras son espectaculares. 10/10 | Гарна та дуже драйвова гра.

Overview: Tomb Raider (2013) is a reboot of the classic action-adventure franchise, offering a fresh origin story for the legendary adventurer Lara Croft. Developed by Crystal Dynamics, the game takes a more grounded and gritty approach to Lara's character, portraying her transformation from a vulnerable young woman into the hardened explorer she's known for. Combining exploration, puzzle-solving, and intense combat, the 2013 iteration offers a blend of action and survival mechanics set on the mysterious island of Yamatai.

Story: The story follows Lara Croft, who, along with her crew, becomes stranded on the island of Yamatai while searching for the lost kingdom of Himiko. The island, however, is home to many dark secrets, including a dangerous cult and other perils that put Lara’s life in constant jeopardy. Throughout the game, Lara faces various challenges and fights to survive, all while uncovering the island’s mysteries and discovering her own strength.

The narrative is engaging, focusing on Lara's personal journey and her development as a character. The story touches on themes of survival, trust, and the cost of discovery, with the stakes rising as Lara delves deeper into the island’s secrets. The characters are well-developed, though the focus is primarily on Lara, making her transformation and growth the heart of the plot.

Gameplay: Tomb Raider (2013) brings a mix of exploration, platforming, puzzle-solving, and combat. The controls are smooth and accessible, with an emphasis on both exploration and action. As Lara navigates the island, players engage in intense combat against various enemies, including mercenaries, wild animals, and the island’s cultists. The combat system is robust, offering a variety of weapons, from bow and arrows to firearms, as well as a range of stealth and melee attacks.

The game also features light RPG elements, allowing players to upgrade Lara’s weapons and abilities as they progress. This adds a layer of depth to the gameplay, encouraging players to explore the island thoroughly to collect resources and improve their equipment. There are also collectible items and hidden treasures scattered throughout the game, rewarding those who take the time to explore off the beaten path.

Graphics and Performance: The graphics in Tomb Raider (2013) are exceptional, with lush environments, stunning character models, and impressive lighting effects. The island of Yamatai is beautifully designed, ranging from treacherous cliffs to dense jungles, all rendered in high detail. The character animations, particularly Lara’s, are lifelike, and the facial expressions convey emotion and intensity. The cinematic cutscenes are integrated seamlessly into the gameplay, making the narrative feel fluid and immersive.

The game runs smoothly on most modern systems, with well-optimized performance. On higher settings, the visuals are breathtaking, but even at lower settings, the game still maintains a high level of quality.

Audio Design: The audio design in Tomb Raider is excellent, with a haunting and atmospheric soundtrack that complements the game’s tone. The sound effects are realistic, from the sounds of Lara’s footsteps on different surfaces to the crackling of fire and distant roars of danger. The voice acting, particularly from Camilla Luddington as Lara Croft, is solid, adding depth to the character’s emotions as she faces peril after peril.

Challenges: While the game is generally well-balanced, some sections can feel a bit repetitive, especially in terms of combat. Some of the puzzles are relatively simple, and while they provide a nice break from the action, they don’t challenge players too much. The difficulty ramps up during some of the more intense sequences, especially during the combat-heavy portions, but overall, the game provides an enjoyable experience without being overwhelmingly difficult.

Final Thoughts: Tomb Raider (2013) successfully reinvents the franchise, offering a modern and more personal take on Lara Croft’s origin story. The game blends action, exploration, and survival mechanics into a thrilling adventure, with a great narrative that makes you care about Lara’s journey. Its visuals, gameplay mechanics, and immersive world design make it a standout entry in the action-adventure genre.

Pros:

Engaging story with strong character development
Beautiful graphics and immersive world design
Satisfying combat mechanics with a variety of weapons
Excellent audio and voice acting
Exploration and collectibles add depth to gameplay
Cons:

Combat can become repetitive
Some puzzles are relatively easy
Certain sections of the game feel linear
Tomb Raider (2013) is a fantastic reboot that blends classic Tomb Raider elements with modern gameplay features. It offers an emotionally engaging and thrilling adventure for players who enjoy action, exploration, and survival mechanics. Highly recommended for fans of action-adventure games and those looking to experience Lara Croft's origin story in a fresh light. | Ben tomb raider cuk seviyorum ve en sevdiğim oyunu da bu ben cok keyif alarak oynadım erkek arkadaşıma da zorla oynattım benden başka kız görmekten hoşlanmadığı için biraz zorlandı fakat bitirince cok sevdi (sevmedi) gitsin o anca cs oynasın zaten ne anlar kaliteli oyundan hıh"

The Garage itself almost feels like a home with how modern looking and clean it looks. It makes you feel like you're actually running a super professional garage. 

Part of this is nostalgia too. A lot of games in the 2015 era had this sleek modern aesthetic to them in some shape or fashion.

Game play wise, it gets very easy once you learn the basics and unlock all the tools that can speed up diagnosing issues with a car. However, what really make it fun is being able to flip cars for a profit and that's how you make big money. 

I would strongly recommend this game, except the 2021 version is out and while it loses that modern ""clean"" 2015 era aesthetic, it feels much more realistic, the graphics are updated, cars actually look dirty if they are old and rusty, etc. Plus, flipping cars becomes even more fun due to the increased variety. So recommending this game as it's a good gateway to the rest of them. 

I'd skip pass 2018. It's definitely more modern, but your garage  makes you feel like you're working in a small shack/barn rather than an actual shop. Where 2021, you're literally the owner of your own shop and can upgrade/add buildings and such. You can upgrade in the 2018 version too, but it still feels like you're working in a random old barn behind an abandoned factory.

76561198192893105,322190,SteamWorld Heist,1.05,"RPG, Strategy",2,"It's fun for a while but becomes somewhat repetitive after the second chapter. 

The balancing feels somewhat off, it's very difficult on the 4th difficulty and pretty much too easy on the third, also you'll get punished and lose xp for playing on lower difficulties which makes utilizing new crew members just even more of an annoying grind. 

There are a couple of other game design choices which bothered me. You are only able to sell items in the loadout screen before a mission or when your inventory is full after a mission, whenever you are in a shop and want to buy something new but you are full you can't - you have to go back to a mission into the loadout screen, sell it there and then comeback - waiting for docking inbetween makes this even more of a pain. 

Whenever there are multiple enemies swarming you, they usually won't utilize the game mechanics of bouncing bullets against walls or rarely flank you, they will just run up to your cover, hold their barrel into it and shoot directly through it, into your face - which feels pretty lame and like not very well coded enemy behaviour. 

Whenever you get overwhelmed and fail a mission you'll lose a good chunk of your ingame curreny - so the entire process of making progress doesn't come down to how smart you play because the level design doesn't bring many opportunities to do so - it comes down how good you've grinded up your character level and gear. I don't think this is a good game design choice for a linear casual game. You'll utilize the same 3-4 squad members and you'll repeat the same gameplay loop over and over again until you've finished the game. If you can't continue you simply need to grind.  

Hats serve no purpose and are just for cosmetics. 

All in all the game feels like a rather shallow 2D X-COM and it definitely has it's flaws. I still think that it has charm and is fun for atleast a couple of hours. I'd barely recommend it whenever it's on heavy discount otherwise I wouldn't. (6/10) | [h1]Roboter im Weltall [/h1]

Nachdem ich mir den [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2396240/SteamWorld_Heist_II/]zweiten Teil[/url] bereits kostenlos dank des Kuratorenprogramms zur Gemüte führen durfte, habe ich mir mal den Vorgänger geholt. Erfahren wir einmal, ob er genau so viel Spaß macht.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
In „SteamWorld Heist“ ändert sich das 2D Buddelspiel der Vorgänger zu einem rundenbasierten Taktikableger. Wir schicken eine kleinen Trupp an Kämpfern mit verschiedenen Kämpfern in kleine Missionen und im besten Fall kommen auch genau so viele Kämpfer wieder aus der Mission raus. Jede Figur hat pro Runde zwei Aktionen zur Verfügung und verfügt einzigartige Fähigkeiten. Im ersten Teil gibt es noch kein Multi-Class Prinzip wie im [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2396240/SteamWorld_Heist_II/]zweiten Teil[/url]. Stattdessen haben die Bots zwar Klassen, entwickeln jedoch mit einem Level-Up einfach linear ihre eigenen Fähigkeiten. Dies schränkt gerade neu rekrutierte Bots erst einmal ein, aber man kann sich ja sehr frei entscheiden, welche Missionen man erledigen möchte oder auch welche Bots man immer mitleveln möchte. Persönlich mag ich es, wenn meine Leute ja ein ähnliches Level haben und relativ ausgeglichen sind.  Wir zielen übrigens selber und bekommen je nach Waffenwahl manchmal eine Hilfslinie. Das Knifflige daran? Die Leute sind etwas unruhig und viele Waffen haben keine Ziellinie, die wie beim Scharfschützen extrem hilfreich sein kann.
Kurzgesagt ist “Steamworld Heist” also ein Sidescroller [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/200510/XCOM_Enemy_Unknown/]XCOM[/url], in dem wir selber kalkulieren müssen, ob der Schuss ins Ziel geht oder nicht.  Der Aufbau der Level und die Art der Feinde werden dabei in jedem Level neu generiert. Also kann auch ein bereits erledigter Auftrag beim zweiten Mal ganz anders laufen. Das Spiel ist ohnehin darauf ausgelegt, dass man viele Level öfters spielt, da man eine gute Sternebewertung oder aber zusätzliche Beute und Erfahrung haben möchte. Trotzdem ist es mit ca. 15 Spielstunden nur halb so lang wie sein [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2396240/SteamWorld_Heist_II/]Nachfolger[/url].
Zum Spielen kann ich übrigens einen Controller empfehlen, mit dem man sich angenehm zurücklehnen kann.

[b]Story[/b]
Nachdem die Erde aufgrund bestimmter Ereignisse nicht mehr so ganz existiert, treiben sich die Bots auf verschiedenen „Scherben“ des Planeten herum und natürlich auch im Weltall. Piper Faraday will als Schmugglerin zwar überwiegend ihre Ruhe, allerdings bekommt sie diese Ruhe dank der Schrotter und der Marine nicht. Also beschließt die Dame auf eigene Faust mal so richtig durchzuräumen. Auf dem Weg kommen wir einer größeren Geschichte auf die Spur und unterhalten uns mit unseren rekrutierten Mitgliedern, die ihren ganz eigenen Charme mit einbringen. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3407461059
Allerdings darf man hier jetzt keine große Geschichte erwarten, die voller Plottwists ist. Stattdessen haben wir unsere eher oberflächlichen Helden und bekämpfen oberflächliche Feinde. Zum Verständnis hilft es, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/571310/SteamWorld_Dig_2/]SteamWorld Dig 2[/url] gespielt zu haben. Aber notwendig ist es sicherlich nicht. 

[b]Grafik/Sound[/b]
Die Grafik ist konsequent bunt gehalten. Ich mag den rostigen Stil und insbesondere die Machart der Charaktere. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3407463065
Man kann das Spiel problemlos auf Deutsch spielen. Allerdings gibt es dann doch manchmal Fehler bei den Texten, wodurch man den Sinn nicht mehr versteht. Ich nehme an, man hat da wirklich jemand Englischsprachigen das Spiel ins Deutsche übersetzen lassen. 

[b]DLCs[/b]
Die kosmetischen drei Hüte der Hatbox sind kostenlos verfügbar. Allerdings muss man die sich im Steam Shop manuell holen. Die andere Hatbox enthält ebenfalls nur Hüte, ist allerdings kostenpflichtig. Um man die braucht…Am Interessantesten dürfte das DLC „The Outsider“ sein, in dem wir ein neues Mitglied für unsere Crew bekommen, der eine Verbindung zum Vorgänger [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/571310/SteamWorld_Dig_2/]Steamworld Dig 2[/url] mitbringt. Diese Figur hat nicht nur im Kampf interessante Fähigkeiten, sondern bringt auch ein paar neue Missionen mit.

[b]Fazit[/b]
Genau wie der [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2396240/SteamWorld_Heist_II/]zweiten Teil[/url] hat mir auch der erste Teil sehr gut gefallen. Die Spiele ähneln sich zwar, aber dennoch kann ich beide klar empfehlen. Dieses Spiel fällt hier noch etwas flacher in den Spielmechaniken wie Klassen aus. Auch haben wir noch keine Oberwelt zu bereisen. Man könnte also sagen, der erste Teil ist simpler, aber auch das ist erfrischend. Leider wird es keinen dritten Teil geben, aber ich kann die „Steamworld“-Spiele, die sehr vielfältig sind, trotzdem sehr empfehlen. 


Rundenstrategie mag ich ja sehr. Für mehr davon und noch viel mehr Reviews in anderen Bereichen schau doch mal in [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Drakeschool] meiner Steamgruppe[/url] oder der [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ger_steam] German Steam Community[/url] vorbei! | This game is a really fun turn-based tactical shooter. However, it falls apart at the higher difficulties due to the alarm mechanic which forces a slower turn based gameplay into a rush as more enemies pile in which can quickly overwhelm you. This is even worse towards the end of the game as you get enemies which can teleport and shoot on the same turn with two or three enemies spawning each turn. This game definitely rewards quicker strategy over slow turn based turtling combat like XCOM. The 100% for this is also really difficult with the whole game being required to be completed on the highest difficulty with no mission failures, all missions fully completed, and in 800 turns or less across the whole game. | Com certeza é um dos melhores jogos de estratégia por turno que já vi.

A história, apesar de simples, é boa e é uma sequência direta dos eventos de Steamworld dig 2. A trilha é opercional, mas os efeitos sonoros são muito bem feitos [se for banco sonoro to chocada]

O melhor mesmo é o fator replay + os personagens interagindo entre si. Vale o preço cheio sem dúvidas, são pelo menos 10h de gameplay. | Игра супер!

76561198192893105,214490,Alien: Isolation,8.15,Action,7,"[b]Alien: Isolation is the definitive experience for fans of Ridley Scott’s Alien (1979) film and a landmark achievement in survival horror gaming. Developed by Creative Assembly, this game captures the heart-pounding dread of the original film, placing players in a desperate fight for survival aboard the Sevastopol station. With incredible visuals, masterful sound design, and a relentless AI-controlled Xenomorph, this is a must-play for horror enthusiasts and science fiction fans alike.[/b]

[h1]Story: A Fight for Survival in the Depths of Space[/h1]
[b]Set 15 years after the events of Alien (1979), Alien: Isolation follows Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen Ripley, as she searches for answers about her mother’s disappearance. Amanda’s journey takes her to Sevastopol, a decrepit space station housing a deadly Xenomorph. The narrative masterfully ties into the franchise’s lore, creating a compelling story filled with tension, dread, and human desperation.
The plot unfolds at a slow-burn pace, gradually immersing players in the terror of being hunted by an unstoppable alien predator. Combined with memorable characters and a genuine respect for the source material, the story is a worthy addition to the Alien franchise.[/b]

[h1]Atmosphere: Immersive Sci-Fi Horror[/h1]
[b]The atmosphere in Alien: Isolation is unmatched. Sevastopol feels like a living, breathing space station, brought to life with stunning visuals and meticulous attention to detail. Every corridor, console, and piece of machinery is lovingly recreated to match the retro-futuristic aesthetic of the original film. The flickering lights, hissing vents, and echoes of distant machinery create a foreboding environment that will keep you on edge.
The sound design is equally brilliant. The creaks of the station, the screeches of the Xenomorph, and the eerie silence of space combine to create a constant feeling of dread. Playing with headphones is a must for the full effect.[/b]

[h1]Gameplay: Survival at Its Most Intense[/h1]
[b]Alien: Isolation is a survival horror game in its purest form. Unlike traditional action games, this is not a power fantasy, Amanda is vulnerable and must rely on stealth, resource management, and quick thinking to survive. The Xenomorph is a relentless predator, guided by some of the best AI in gaming. It learns from your actions, adapting its behavior to keep you constantly guessing.
In addition to the Xenomorph, players must contend with hostile androids, panicked humans, and the environment itself. Crafting tools and using distractions are key to surviving, but resources are scarce, and every decision matters. The gameplay brilliantly balances tension and strategy, ensuring every moment feels significant.[/b]

[h1]Visuals and Sound: A Love Letter to the Original Film[/h1]
[b]Visually, Alien: Isolation is stunning. From the retro-futuristic design of Sevastopol to the intricate animations of the Xenomorph, the game is a visual treat. Lighting plays a crucial role, with shadows and flickering lights creating a sense of unease around every corner.
The sound design deserves special praise. The game’s audio perfectly captures the essence of Alien, from the ominous hum of the station to the terrifying roar of the Xenomorph. The dynamic soundtrack intensifies encounters, adapting to the danger level and keeping you on edge throughout.[/b]

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Incredible atmosphere: Faithfully recreates the look and feel of the original Alien movie.
[*]Relentless AI Xenomorph: The unpredictable and adaptive AI creates genuine tension.
[*]Immersive sound design: Eerie and terrifying, adding to the sense of dread.
[*]Challenging gameplay: Encourages careful planning, resource management, and stealth.
[*]Respect for the source material: A must-play for fans of the Alien franchise.
[*]Varied threats: Beyond the Xenomorph, the hostile androids and humans provide variety.
[*]Visually stunning: Beautifully detailed environments and animations.
[/list]
[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Steep difficulty: The game can be unforgiving, which may frustrate some players.
[*]Pacing issues: Some sections feel overly drawn out or repetitive.
[*]No action-oriented options: Fans of more combat-heavy gameplay may feel constrained.
[*]Scarce resources: While intentional, resource scarcity can make certain sections feel overly punishing.
[*]Intense for some players: The constant sense of vulnerability and dread isn’t for everyone.
[/list]

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
[b]Alien: Isolation is the closest gaming has ever come to recreating the nerve-shredding tension of Ridley Scott’s Alien. It’s a game that rewards patience, strategy, and nerves of steel. The meticulous attention to detail, coupled with the dynamic AI and immersive sound design, makes every encounter unforgettable.
While the steep difficulty and intense atmosphere may not appeal to everyone, fans of survival horror and the Alien franchise will find Alien: Isolation to be an unparalleled experience. Whether you're creeping through Sevastopol's dark corridors or holding your breath as the Xenomorph prowls overhead, this is a game that will stay with you long after the credits roll.[/b] | Main menus in games are basically opening sequences of movies. Its there to set the mood, to prepare you for what you are about to play and dive into. Most game don't hit the nail here but some do and Alien Isolation is one of them. A lone space station is seen as a speck in distant orbit of a massive Jupiter like planet. The string quartet begins followed by drowning giving you a sense of something unknown. That to me is the hallmark of game presentation and the main menu of this game achieves everything it needs to for a horror experience. Putting you into a state of unease. Letting the player know that they are going to be isolated and far from help.

Almost all of the player base knows of the infamous IGN review done by Ryan McCaffrey who is now Executive Editor. Ryan gave Alien Isolation a score of 5.9 out of 10, remarking the good consisting of the level design and the immersive environment. Ryan is correct on this matter, due to the team at Creative Assembly gaining access to endless production material for the 1979 feature film. The materials would have included tons of H. R. Giger sketches and also Harry Lange's futuristic space designs and interiors. With this amount of resources, the team was able to craft a space station set in the retro future of the 80s. The level designers understood lighting and how to use areas to make you feel on edge, such as implicating sharp edges to almost look like predator teeth and smooth objects that can almost be mistaken for the aliens creature. The remix of Jerry Goldsmiths score weaves itself through the ship, music tenses or sometimes just stops as though the game to you is indicating danger. However, Ryan then began to list the negatives of the game and one of the major ones he lists was the monster itself. The alien.

One of the most talked about aspect of the game is its main antagonist, Mister Alien. Personally, one of the most terrifying creatures to grace the silver screen and my gaming monitor. Spending many hours in the game you would think that one would eventually get use to the creature. To tell the truth, when I hear that thing enter my domain I am instantly filled with dread. Kudos to the team for making this stress inducing creation and this is where Ryan had his problem, the AI. During a round table discussion where Ryan gathered his review friends to help defend his final score for the game, most of them had indicated the frustration with the AI behavior, its unpredictability. Brian Altano during the discussion started referring to Splinter Cell, indicating set patterns of enemies and knowing where things are. Brian then states the unhinged AI and not knowing its patterns, always being a roadblock. I think all of you know what I am trying to state here. This is the most defining feature of this game. Ask any player who had finished this game and they would always have some nightmare story of their encounter. Its always different. The AI is designed in such a way to adapt to your behavior. The game is survival horror. You have to survive by adapting to an adapting enemy. I guess for video game journalists, they just want a horror house experience. Get locked in a tramp ride where things just jump at you to finally reach the end and just leave. You can have your little Outlast fat men chase you down hallways all you want, but nothing will equal to when the Alien enters the room you are in and starts tip toeing around after goose stepping over to your location. There nothing more terrifying when the bastard stops moving and becomes silent as a mouse to hear more clearly and awaiting for your move. That to me, is horror.

Ryan lastly stated pacing issues. Pacing he is half right on, but I would disagree considering there are points of the game where it does slow down, but even during those moments you are on edge. I think the game does have an issue with some padding. The biggest issue the game has is its story and characters being sidelined. Even then the other two aspects of the game are such a strong foundation that you kind of accept the lack of character or better narrative because so much time was spend on other factors. I could touch on the crafting mechanics of the game and the tools you use for your survival but they also feel sidelined by other elements. The most important things are you, the alien and the ship. Everything else is secondary and that's fine. 

Now there are other problems the game faces that players dislike, not everyone is going to enjoy the stealth. The game is also a slow burner which players would also have an issue with. There is a good reason the game developers recommended the hard difficulty, you get the full horror experience. To me, with all its flaws, Alien Isolation will remain peak horror. I will never forget the one moment that made my sanctuary vent adventures turn into a vent nightmare. No other game has never made me feel so unsafe and terrified in my life. Now whenever I go into vents, I am on edge. This is what a true horror game is. Its when I have no safe space and I must scream. | I finally played it after years of it sitting in my inventory, this might be the best survival horror game of all time. I have never died so much but had so much fun. | For it being more than 10 years old it has not aged a bit

Windward could be described as a micro MMORPG/sandbox naval ship themed game.

You start choosing a faction, with a minor difference between them, and later can be freely changed, or a pirate. Set sail to a basic procedure generated set of maps and do whatever you want. You can earn gold through trades, quest, looting random boxes around the sea and pirate hunting.

Controlling your ship can be done via WASD or even just the mouse. Since the basic attack are triggered automatically, you will spend most of the time trying to use your skills in the best way possible and avoiding the other ships attacks that have the same attacks and skills as you.

There isn't a story in game or any end goal set, other than getting max level if you want. Most quests are considered basic even to a 2015 game: fetch quests, hunt a enemy, defend a city. You can create, in the server that you are connected, 3 types of instances of a quick map that does not interfere with the global map and you may invite other players that are in the server as well to your instance. Your ship have 5 customizable color parts: two for the sails, two for the hull/ship and a emblem, the only thing is that you have to find other colors/emblem as loot.

Highly recommend playing in coop since the game loop is rather short so having other players/friends with you make a better experience. You can join public servers or create you own (P2P or dedicated). The one issue that happened to me was that trying to create a P2P server I was not able to let other players join and there is an issue with dedicated server that it does not have a password system and setting it to not show on the master server I could not join it. But due to a lack of players playing this game, at most I had two other players in my server, having a ""private"" game is not a issue.

After around 50-60 hours of gameplay, I was able to get all the achievements using the default game settings. You can change the game parameters to allow faster experience gain and combat difficult in your server/world. The only thing that I never saw was a couple of events that needs more players to trigger, not even as the server admin I was able to summon a couple enemies/events to check how they are in game. Also is possible to add custom emblems to you server.

Music could only be described as the most basic music set possible to a pirate game. Outside of combat, the little music that the game have did make me drowsy quickly, so I had to mute it and play other music that I have of my choice.

By the time of this review, I am on level 90 but I am aware that there is a little bit more content above level 100 to 150, max level being 750 I think. This is important because if you connect to a server or let your server open to anyone, someone may connect to your server using few ships that I would consider a spoiler for newer players.

I can recommend this game for players wanting a simple light hearted MMORPG naval game when played with friends.

To have a gameplay loop like this feel good, the world needs to be interesting.  The world is very bland, basic procedural, which would require much more on the gameplay side to work.  I hope they pursue one of these avenues in the sequel, I feel it could work either way. | Sol if you haven't played windward get it already... its a pretty solid game and fun..single player or online.  Not a lot of players online but its still all playable and fun. bring some friends and it gets even better. | I don't know why this title got abandoned...it had an INCREDIBLE bones, to build a solid title, but somehow, they (he) just released some sort of demo/game.
Basically, you just float around picking up useless crates, get involved in a few skirmishes, and run transport quests, sometimes taking ports. 
Its fun, if you want to play an ARCADE style ship combat game, with no true purpose....but other than that, its not a FULL GAME by any means.

I recommend buying it, but I also warn you against it. The combat is basic and kind of fun...but no purpose to game other than that. I don't understand why it got abandoned, damn shame....only had to add a few things to find a purpose to finish the game, but NOPE. Just straight up dropped project in steam and left.

STEAM should not try to sell these as if it was a game, it should go in the LOST AND FOUND section (its not real, but STEAM should make one for titles like this - A Game you can play, but it's not finished, and it got dropped in a dumpster).

Don't buy it unless under $6. Even $7 is too much to pay."

Basically, we have what appears to be on the surface a unique and interesting take on settlement survival with some wave/tower defense thrown in. However after trying and failing to keep one village alive for even 2 seasons, I have the absolute opinion that what this game really is, is a thinly veiled gacha game in which, even if you do everything right, build everything in the perfect order, place all the buildings in the perfect spots, you still will likely lose because A: you haven't suffered enough to open enough ""god experience"" chests to boost enough stats, and B: the 'random' events seem to absolutely favor causing you the most suffering possible. 

There's not nearly enough margin for the player to express any level of experimentation or creativity in building or defending. Basically, if you don't do everything just right - you doom yourself - often many days before you are even aware of it. Then you get to decide if you are going to spend the next hour slowly watching your village burn away because there's no possible recovery metric.

Dont be afraid to lose and start over, theres a lot of ways for things to go wrong but I really enjoyed cracking the puzzle of how exactly this game works.

Live and Drink. |  I was very on the fence about this game and was going to try it and potentially refund if it wasn't for me. I typically haven't played anything like this and i have absolutely fallen in love with this game. Coming from someone who hasn't played a game like this but was very interested but nervous about figuring out its UI and even understanding the game. Its far FAR less intimidating than it looks. If you can find fun in filling in the blanks and just taking in the absurdity a story that is happening to you, this will be an ABSOLUTE blast. I can play this for so SO long just in hopes to have stories to remember. 

Here's a story that happened to me: 

Deep in an abandoned facility with rusted archways and frayed electrical lines, i scavenged a keycard. As i delved deeper i came to realize i was only allowed to pass specific doors because of this little keycard treasure. Excited, i began to swing doors open in search for more treasures. If these doors were locked that means no others have been behind them! As i dispatched the few weakling boars that had taken the facility as home, there was one more door to open. I kicked it open, unafraid of what i would find. I heard a beep. I was looking down the barrel of a turret. Quickly and instinctively i swung. one, two three FOUR. All four of my arms swung Each axe. The turret dismantled under my tremendous double muscles.
Beep Beep. A second turret took aim and fired. I ducked back before i took any harm. If this room had turrets, there must be incredible treasure to be guarded by such mechanic beasts. Confident with how quickly i destroyed the first, i could absolutely do it again. I leaned in and swung again. the turret crumbled before my hulking body. Behind the turret was a chest with a musket inside. As i close the chest.... Beep beep. 
A turret began blasting behind me. I felt a sting and thuds absorbed from my armor. I knew this victory was too sweet to savor. Quickly i lunge out of the room once more. Three... Three chests i saw. If a musket was in one of them. The others must be worth the risk. I set up camp next to the open door and tended to my wounds. bullet holes riddled the door frame. I pondered... The last turret seemed to be shooting a much larger caliber. This time i was less confident... Because it hurt. The Turret rested at the end of the room. a ways farther than the previous ones by the door. I was given a musket and this was CLEARLY the solution. I had a pocket full of slugs that i had saved up. I loaded the one chamber musket and walked to the door. BLAM! BEEP BEEP. The turret returned fire once again shredding the entrance of the room. Again i took a hit that was more painful than usual. Painful enough to not ignore. Again i took rest and tended my wounds. the musket did very Little and i should of known. I barely knew how to use the thing. For three days I repeated the same thing. Firing my single shot and plugging my wounds. I don't know if it was me being stubborn, Or i was consumed by pure curiosity and greed but i NEEDED to know what was in those chests. I decided i must delve deeper in this mysterious facility. Who knows what other treasures i would find in the lower levels. The first chest i found contained a mysterious artifact. With some miracle i was able to identify this as an explosive.... A plasma grenade...I grin. THIS is the solution! not this useless pea shooter musket. I run back up a floor to the room, I pull the pin with little hazard. In my mind i knew i had bested the brainless gunbeast. I throw the grenade and  .... The whole wall separating the turret from the room explodes in my face. I did not account for the blast radius...  Dazed, and horribly injured the dust settled... Beep beep. I was somehow standing next to the turret. In the confusion and panic i stood arms distance from the Disgusting Bullet hose... I knew i could not take another volley. In these seconds i thought of my options. The turret was barely affected by my onslaught. A swing from my axes was too risky. Either i dispatched it Right there and hope all four of my swings land true, Or it killed me where i stand. There... i saw a button glowing atop the gun. In passing knowledge i had learned the button usually will have no effect and infact make the turret more aware of your presence... I had no choice. I pressed it.....

""Keycard identified. Turret powering down"" 

I walked out of there, hardly standing. Exhausted. With a brand new sniper rifle  an assortment of relics and artifacts from the chests in that room. and..... and that little keycard treasure worth much MUCH more than its weight in water. | 这游戏太难评价了，即便以个人体验的角度来讲，这游戏都很难给出一个简单明了的整体印象，在每个爽点背后都有痛点

絮叨一下我作为一个非典型伪非roguelike爱好者，游生第一款通关的传统roguelike的体验吧，希望在整理感想的过程中能总结出来一个整体概括

我对于传统roguelike一直有一种叶公好龙式的向往，自从20多年前我知道了roguelike这个游戏类型之后，我一直就对这个类型的游戏有一种品味标榜上的虚伪向往（非常之low），因为与其他类型的游戏相比，传统rouguelike得益于其简陋的画面带来的极低美术压力，在系统深度，互动性，build丰富程度等层面可以说是碾压众生，所以初闻其名的我当时立刻在随身携带的软盘中加入了nethack，在每个机房拉下roguelike的踪迹。每次看到有人讨论如果流落荒岛只能带一款游戏该带什么的时候，我脑子里第一个蹦出来的永远是矮人要塞。手机进入智能机时代之后最让我开心的一件事就是能在手机上玩nethack了。把roguebasin上所有的词条挨个看了一遍然后找来玩。当时恨不得把我玩roguelike我有品位贴在脑门儿上。

但是，可是，但可是，可笑的是，在通关卡德洞窟之前，我从来没有真正深入的玩过任何一款传统roguelike，别说通关了，就连摸清楚系统玩法能像模像样的把迷宫打到超过5层的经历都完全没有。我是个俗人，玩游戏就是喜欢音画感官好和成长反馈简单粗暴。所以无论我如何在情感上仰慕传统roguelike那种独特的游戏体验，实际玩上一阵子就会因为画面太简陋，死亡惩罚太大，学习难度太高而转去玩更轻松的游戏。

我觉得我好像一直就是在等一款适合我的roguelike，我试过stone soup，adom，矮人要塞的冒险模式，感觉都缺了一些能吸引我达成心流的东西，曾经我以为我等的是tome，试了下发现也不是。但是当我第一次在trow.cc上看到bozar推荐卡德洞窟的时候，我有了被击中的感觉，我觉得这个游戏就是我等的那个roguelike，所以当时就买了。

这么多年来我一直在等这个游戏完成的那一天，我一直好奇卡德洞窟和cogmind哪一个会成为我人生第一款通关的roguelike。通关卡德洞窟之后我希望cogmind做慢点，我得消化两年才能玩下一个roguelike。

经过了漫长的等待，以及感觉上甚至同样漫长的游戏体验之后，我觉得卡德洞窟在80%的程度上对得起我的期待。

在这个游戏漫长的开发过程中，我曾经打开过很多次ea版本，但没有一次能玩超过1小时，根本门儿都摸不着，虽然我知道roguelike对于新手来说基本是个面向wiki才能play的游戏类型，但我确实很难提起激情去看大段英文。谢天谢地，正式版有了个不错的新手教程，在完整的玩了两次教程之后（第一次玩完教程发现一半的功能怎么用没记住）我很无缝的正式踏入这个世界。用的就是教程中的角色模板，回过头看这个精心设计过的模板角色可以说是为了新手量身定做的生存build。

看了下wiki上的新手指南，我开始去做第一个任务，去初始村庄北方的一个迷宫调查水藤生长不良的问题，迷宫挺大的，多达五层，不过预设模板的角色很强，能打能跑，砍瓜切菜一样打完了。攻略里说打完迷宫五层的任务怪，既可以原路返回，也可以继续往南，沿着一条地下水路回到村子。以我探索流的游戏风格，怎么可能走回头路，肯定走地下河啊！然后我就第一次体会到了这个游戏的恐怖之处，迷宫，只有五层，但是迷宫之外，是整个世界，无边无际，而且没有任何地标指示。我在往南摸索着走了五六个地图之后放弃了，进行了一个原路的返回，跌跌撞撞的爬回了地面。当然，当时的我经验不足，没有能力在地下确认自己的方位和找到合适的出口。但是这个经历应该是所有第一次玩这个游戏的人都会有的。我觉得这可能也是我对这款游戏最大的标志性感觉，一个字，“大”，很大，非常大。

Qud，是这个世界的名字，那么为什么要叫caves of qud？理解这个游戏名字的含义，本来应该属于游戏体验的一部分，但是你手贱爱看别人的玩后感，我就只好愉快的剧透你。洞窟这个词力压卡德排在前面，是因为这个游戏中的洞窟，太（用来表示强烈感情的脏话语气词）大了。任何人刚进入这个游戏，首先可能会惊叹于这个游戏的地图很大。有多大呢？世界地图的大小是25*80，单位是parasang，然后每一个parasang是由3x3，也就是9个zone组成，一个zone基本相当于其他传统roguelike中的一层迷宫，也就是说如果把这个游戏的世界地图当作迷宫的话，这个迷宫有25*80*9=18000层，很多了对吧？但是，我这里引用一句wiki里世界地图页面中的一句话“世界地图和地表区域只是你冒险的开始，卡德广阔的洞窟在等着您”，洞窟有多大呢？抱歉，我不知道，wiki妹说，你问我最远到了哪里？我只能说，我下到了地下102层的时候看到继续向下的楼梯已经想吐了，看上去根本就没有尽头。这个游戏的区域地图和异星工场类似，是在玩家探索到的时候才生成的，所以一个存档，玩的越久，探索的越多，地图就越大。既然地下100层都没到头，考虑到和探索深度有关的成就只需要探索到60层，我猜这游戏或许确实没有常规玩法能探索到的深度限制，考虑到地下每一层都和地面一样大，那就是18000*n（n>102）的规模，所以这游戏的地图规模我觉得多少能占个xx之最一类的名头。

当然，这么大的地图有没有相应的探索价值是个自然而然会冒出来的问题。确实，没有，想也知道这么大的地图绝大部分都是程序生成的，不可能有高探索回报。这个游戏中做的好的部分自然是手工打造的一系列特殊地下城，其他99.9999999%的区域都是给玩家进行随机资源获取的。毕竟这个游戏的敌人和可收获植物都是不会再生的，如果没有一个足够大的世界给玩家去探索，可能会导致某些资源无法获取。这种程序生成的大世界是一把双刃剑，一方面他提供了海量的探索场景和资源回报，另一方面也会令人觉得无聊和作业感太重，我想这个问题在程序生成内容技术有下一次革命进步之前是无解的。

在卡德洞窟的地下迷路是一次非常独特的体验，特别是前期没有拿到回城器的时候，如果在野外看到一个洞口一时好奇走了进去，然后因为好奇心驱使不停的越走越远，那很可能想要回头的时候发现找不到回去的路了，这个时候作为一款传统roguelike游戏，在存档系统上的特点就带来了很有趣的效果，如果没办法回到地面上，那之前几小时的探索就全都报销了。

这里顺便聊聊本作的存档系统吧。按硬派柏林诠释来说，roguelike就不应该有存档，中断都不应该有，一局一命一期一会一人没狗。但真的搞这么硬派的话估计这游戏实在卖不了多少，反正玩家也会修改或者用mod，何苦呢？所以作为现代化的传统roguelike，卡德洞窟除了传统的一命经典模式，还有可以在村庄存盘的冒险模式，死了可以选择在上次落脚过的村庄重新开始。不仅如此，考虑到这游戏的通关时间很长，所以游戏有中断系统，可以在退出的时候保存，那么自然也考虑了避免断电和崩溃的自动存盘，经过一位非常超绝可爱的朋友在我发的截图下面留言提醒，我才注意到在切换地图一定次数后会自动保存，所以即便玩的是一命模式，只要altf4，也可以回档免死。而且开发者也知道存档这东西他们也做不了主，很直接的在设置里面给了打开随时手动存档的选项。

也就是说从存档系统这个角度考察的话，这游戏其实已经非常不roguelike了，和随便存盘读盘之间只差一层窗户纸，愿不愿意用一条命折磨/挑战自己全靠玩家自觉。

不过即便是可以随便存档读档，其实在游戏初期能力较弱的时候，以及后期面对一些较难缠的局面的时候，这个简陋的存档系统还是能给人带来一定压力，而且村庄存档，自动存档和手动快捷存档之间是分开的，我曾经读错档一夜回到解放前，所以探索起来肯定不像真正的现代游戏那样毫无压力。毕竟生存压力在roguelike中还是蛮重要的，毫无压力导致的紧张感消解也会让游戏乐趣下降很多。

存档系统的简陋其实是和这个游戏的另一方面的系统有着很强关联的，那就是随机性。这个游戏有大量的随机内容，所以如果存档系统过于直接，玩家会很容易想要尝试反复S/L来获取最好的效果，其实我就这么做过。游戏后期有一种敌人在打到玩家后会引发变异，80%的机率负面，20%的机率正面，这个变异是不能解除的，很多负面变异会造成不大不小的麻烦而且持续终身，所以我每次被打到都会S/L到获得正面变异，非常之鸡贼。开发者针对这种S/L还做了一些代码上的不大不小的阻碍，随机结果的乱数不会因为读盘改变，读盘之后如果什么都不做的话，变异的结果是固定的，必须打打怪什么的做一些交互改变乱数才能改变变异结果，所以就是你想凹让你凹但你会凹的很辛苦，类似的情况还有很多，比如食用料理的结果，分解装备的结果，升级突变的结果，有大量的随机内容可以通过s/l来凹，但是什么都凹会凹的劳心劳力玩起来非常累。开发者还在游戏里做了时间回溯相关的能力，给不想s/l的玩家可以在遇到坏结果的时候凭本事回溯的能力，感觉算是自我规制玩法必备的能力。

这个游戏不那么传统的部分也是我能顺利通关的原因，传统roguelike极高的死亡成本一直是一个很高的劝退门槛，但本作在这方面降到了几乎零门槛，基本可以当成老头环一类怎么浪都没压力的探索型游戏来玩，可以说是传统ruguelike界的数祖忘典，甚至这游戏大方到了内置了一个比一般的修改器功能还强大wish指令，想要什么直接命令行输就行了，属性点技能点特殊能力生命上限全都管够，无敌都随便开，而且也完全不影响存档评价和成就之类的，只要自己不想难受不嫌无聊，电动轮椅随便敞开了用。

所以我觉得这游戏很难评，因为他很拧巴。这游戏做了超过10年，我看制作者访谈的时候能明显感受出他们对于游戏部分内容的力不从心。这个游戏的规模体量和制作者追求的传统roguelike加高lore超大世界有机融合的游戏模式，叠加这个漫长的制作周期和绝对称不上充裕的技术能力和制作资源，都决定了这个游戏必然是一款充满妥协和遗憾的作品。这游戏能有现在这个完成度我觉得已经非常值得称赞了。

我觉得这个游戏不适合大部分人，虽然它在传统roguelike这个品类里算得上非常的modern了，但还是有着很高的学习门槛，这游戏12月6日发布1.0正式版，到1月31日我玩了170多个小时通关，快两个月过去了，通关成就的解锁率只有0.8%，要知道会买这个游戏的人本身就已经是被筛选过的，通关率这么低可见这游戏有多么难以下咽。所以你如果对传统roguelike游戏没有一定的了解和心理准备，这个游戏买了也大概率吃灰。

最后列一些我觉得这个游戏的闪光点吧
大到不可能探索得完的世界，能带来很好的沉浸感
丰富的技能道具和装备系统，有打造自己build乐趣
探索回报比较合理，反正比老头环强点儿！
一系列手工打造的庞大迷宫，在简陋的画面下也很有震撼力
丰富的生物种类
有趣的背景设定
海量的程序生成的历史文本，很套路，但也努力的提供了沉浸感
一流水准的Ascii风格美术
努力的做了一些电影化的演出，颇有戏剧张力

当然也得说一下会让人感觉烦躁和遗憾的地方
作为传统roguelike，不看wiki基本寸步难行
随机性和简陋的存档系统使得s/l破坏心流的情况时有发生
丰富，但还不够丰富的技能和数值，build看似多样，但还是不够自由，比如手段贫瘠的近战攻击技能（斧子断肢，锤子眩晕，剑aoe），以及手段更贫瘠的远程攻击技能（上标记和平射，没了），我第一次看到双持分类里的四个技能全都是加副手命中率的时候甚至觉得我穿越了
部分系统的缺失显得本作作为一个roguelike少了些味道，比如没有偷窃，也不能把东西塞给其他生物，感觉是因为本作技能系统的比重很大，没有办法对所有生物所有情况适配所有能力，所以non-modal这方面肯定差了不少意思，如果追求脑洞类玩法可能会觉得很失望
复杂的液体表现的画面效果有时令人不适，烟雾也是
液体的处理很麻烦，天天泡在恒河水里
负重管理需要游戏经验，提供很多负面体验
道具获得完全看脸，虽然这是roguelike的本意，但是对于轻度玩家来说，自己build想要的关键装备搞不到肯定不是愉快体验
顶级装备可遇而不可求，在数量极其稀少的情况下完全没有一丁点定向获取的可能，真是太roguelike了，令我收集控玩家不爽
文本和剧情趣味性比较一般，有些浪费设定（前面忘了说，我最初是冲着设定买的这个游戏）
世界比较静态，玩家不在的地方时间完全静止，会降低沉浸感，当然也减少了难度减少了迷路
开放式大世界可以随意获取资源，导致难度曲线基本不可控，对于老害来说不做自我规制的话基本不能提供合格的传统roguelike挑战体验
缺乏足够具有挑战的endgame内容，数值堆起来之后能对玩家造成威胁的情况太少，怪物的机制显得各自为战，缺乏相互配合的化学反应
地下60层之后敌人和难度似乎都不再有变化，而且很模式化，缺乏惊喜也缺乏挑战
部分任务的设计和调整不到位，难度随机性太大或者缺乏引导，我甚至在最后的场景研究怎么通关折腾了一个小时，网上都找不到详细的信息

好听的：大世界里最rogue的，rogue里大世界做的最好的
不好听的：大世界毁了rogue体验，rogue部分导致大世界玩着太累
写到这里我觉得大概可以给这个游戏做一个我个人体验上的总结了
一个字：拧

不来拧一下吗？ | Explorer?  Yes, Qud can scratch that itch. Big gameplay map, a great job of procedural generation that provides places, rumors, and histories that are fresh each time. Game modes that support checkpointing and reduced danger. Deep social systems to explore.

Optimizer? Yes. lots of gear and theorycrafting hooks (not limited to hooks for feet) to feed the possibility space. And that social system to exploit. And a savescum feature built into the ironman mode to let you tinker with your options.

Instigator? Phase out and let that fire-spitting pig shoot through you and hit the bat that likes to eat electricity. Duck into a corner, let everyone kill everyone else, and then just pick up the loot.

Collector? Perhaps you'd enjoy collecting one face from every faction in the game? Just slice it off, there's more than one way to do it. Yup, from robots too. Too gruesome? How about a geology run where you animate every type of wall and walk it back to a home base?

There's 17 years of love and madness poured into this game. If you suspect you'd be interested, you should indulge. If you're concerned about graphics, I'd ask you to consider that art direction is more important than graphic fidelity. If you're put off by rogue conventions, switch the game to roleplay mode and do just a little research to bootstrap. 

One story, if I might. At the endgame, I piloted a great creature that took the form of a cat. During a pause in battle, my allies approached, and pet the cat-war-machine.

“抱歉，昨晚我一无所获”
但是我很高兴 | 其实这个游戏的一周目才是最震撼的，因为不熟悉机制和操作反而更能体会平民在战争中的艰辛和无助。为了自己和同伴的生存，不得不做一些违背良心的选择、不得不在强权下苟延残喘、不得不去欺凌更弱小的人……

然后是二周目……三周目……四周目，渐渐地，我在游戏中发展出了万恶的资本主义，通过初期抢劫偷窃的原始的资本积累发展出了工业体系，左手生产倾销，右手霸占原料，全身武装过上了一天三顿罐头加香烟美酒的骄奢淫逸的生活。
 | [h1] This War of Mine não é um game comum. Para ser sincero, ele não é um game. Ele é uma experiência dolorosa, difícil de aceitar e extremamente necessária no universo dos video games. [/h1]

A realidade que temos nos games é a seguinte: gráficos cada vez mais realistas e um culto ou glorificação da violência. Vibramos quando conseguimos aquele head shot bem dado, ganhamos bônus por matar vários inimigos ao mesmo tempo, achamos chato quando não há sangue depois de um soldado explodir com um foguete vindo sabe-se lá de onde e por aí vai. This War of Mine vem te lembrar que a guerra não é uma jornada para ser o melhor soldado do universo e que, no final das contas, ela é só o desperdício de vidas humanas. Coisa que aparentemente todo o mercado esqueceu.

This War of Mine machuca. Machuca porque você sabe que as coisas não estão fáceis e para sobreviver no meio da guerra você terá que sujar suas mãos. Você não tem comida, remédios ou ataduras para sobreviver, mas o casal de idosos do outro lado da rua pode ter, mas se recusam a abrir a porta. O que fala mais alto? Seu instinto de sobrevivência ou sua humanidade? O hospital esta tratando de feridos com o que restou de remédios, mas quem precisa de mais remédios? Você ou os outros sobreviventes? Seus amigos estão desnutridos e não irão sobreviver sem comer. Para quem deve ficar a última lata de comida?
São essas as situações que você viverá constantemente durante o game. Situações que aconteceram e acontecem no mundo todo: Ucrânia, Polônia, França, Inglaterra, Alemanha, China, Japão, Espanha, Malvinas, Congo, Argélia, Serra Leoa, Iraque, Afeganistão...

A mecânica do game é simples: clique no sobrevivente que quer controlar e onde quer que ele vá. Clique nos ícones para realizar ações: procurar suprimentos, subir ou descer escadas, construir ferramentas, se esconder, atirar, fugir... A simplicidade da jogabilidade é um contraste com a complexidade de gerenciar seus recursos e sobreviventes.
Durante o dia, você deve manter seu abrigo e sobreviventes nas melhores condições possíveis, construindo ferramentas, preparando alguma comida, cuidando de ferimentos, descansando etc. De noite, você deve escolher quem vai sair atrás de suprimentos na cidade sitiada, quem vai descansar no abrigo e quem vai ficar de vigia contra possíveis saqueadores. Isso, é claro, se você tiver sobreviventes e recursos para tudo isso.

Os gráficos são frios, escuros, quase rabiscos feitos numa parede velha. Essa aparência reforça o cenário caótico e sem esperanças da guerra. Não espere aqui alguma cor vibrante no uniforme de um soldado, uma pintura dourada na arma de algum rebelde morto ou várias partículas numa explosão de um morteiro. O game retrata a guerra, não uma brincadeira para vender. A mesma coisa vale para os efeitos sonoros. Nada de marchas sinfônicas ou algum rock para dar adrenalina. Apenas ruídos e barulhos e uma melancólica música a cada dia.

[b] This War of Mine é um tapa na cara de muito estúdio grande, que gosta de retratar a guerra como a superação de um soldado contra um mal maior e glorificar a morte de quem esta do outro lado da arma. Produzido por um pequeno estúdio polonês, o game é uma obra prima e um pedido de paz no mundo através dos games. [/b] | 不要在二周目结束前寻找攻略。

为什么我要给差评？因为这个游戏有一个巨大的BUG，并且自从2016年开始，就已经出现了，发行方一直说下个更新就会改好但迟迟未好，直到现在，大家也都心知肚明了，作者不过是已经弃坑了。我自己翻阅各种贴吧下了各种东西无果后，自己翻阅steam'论坛茫茫信息一条一条翻译后看到的。我希望将要买他的人和已经买了并遇到了同样黑屏问题的人看到，并解决你们的问题。
一开始运行游戏没事，玩了好几次也没事，之后想玩了一点开，就开始黑屏然后windows停止运行，坑爹呢？然后前面也说了不说废话了。
解决方法就是：在我的电脑中搜索<11bitstudios>,然后删了他。之后就可以玩了，类似于黑屏的蹦出框框不能进的一样解决。不能在“我的电脑”中直接搜索到 11bitstudios 的朋友，请按照“C：//”然后“用户”然后“你的电脑用户名”然后“AppData”然后“Roaming”这样的顺序自行找到《11bitstudios》这个文件夹然后删掉。或者在C盘中搜索上一个根目录文件夹“Roaming”然后点开找到《11bitstudios》文件夹自行删掉即可。
非常感谢有好心网友在steam论坛中发出了这个，因为我至今只看到了一个外国网友在一个很少人回复的帖子中发了这个方法，所以我就把他用差评的方式分享了出来，希望大家游戏愉快。
最后对作者说。我希望你能真正尊重喜欢这款游戏的所有玩家。而不是就像我看到的那样，仅仅是在论坛里应声回复而没有行动。因为我真的看到了，所有人，一瞬间对这款游戏的失望。"

I really enjoyed the problem solving, and scenario planning aspect of the game.  It is a ton of fun to play, once you figure it out, and this is where this game falls down, in guiding new players.  

I would highly recommend new players to not shun character guides and other online resources to get going.  This is a ten year old game and I think they purposefully designed the game around ""discovery"" mechanics (especially around character skill progression and item effects) so you learn by doing,  Which I think would be fine if you unlocked something that documented the information for you so if you step away for a few weeks you don't forget.  I find myself wasting resources to ""find out"" what something does only to have forgotten even later in the play through. 

Personally I think if this game underwent a UX/UI cleanup, slightly better tutorialization of some of the mechanics and better information persistance you could re-release this game today and it would attract a huge following. | OK game. Would be awesome without the following two issues. First, the game occasionally CTDs between floors and deletes the autosave (the only allowed save) in the process - so game over. Secondly, large monster waves are a big blob of moving pixels. It is almost impossible to tell which monsters and how many are attacking your heroes. Looks ugly too. I do not get why people like pixel art in this game. Pixel art was not a choice but a necessity back in the day. The best old pixel art (e.g. Prince of Persia, Lemmings) also looked way better than this hot mess. | Addictive, good looking, funny, rogue type game that makes you utilize brain and try it in different play modes.

9/10

Cons - sometimes it is too dependent on random elements. | Не цікава, не весела, цілком порожня гра із високим порогом входження. Не рекомендую нікому. 2/10 (повернув би гроші, якби міг) | It's a good rogue-like style dungeon game, great to play with friends."

It's quite a bit bigger than either of those examples, and much like Templar Battleforce, you could probably spend hundreds of hours optimising your crew and ship.

That said, much like Templar Battleforce, it's not remotely clear why you'd really want to do that, and there's not much in game to help you figure anything out. It is very much a Trese Brothers game, and you will love it or hate it accordingly.

I'd suggest it's a good buy at $10. Play for two hours -  just do the quest, but skip the dialog (or you won't get very far into it). It's likely you will die and not get much done, but it will give you a good feel for what the core gameplay loop is like as much of that is touched on in that first quest. | I really tried to like this game, however I can't get into it
Main problem is balance. Game is too easy or too difficult. Nothing in-between. Battle skills are useless because in easy fights you don't need them and in difficult ones - they won't save you. 
Also dice roll mechanic is complicated so it's barely understandable. Therefore the player doesn't know if one has high or low chances of success
Also in-game time flies so fast that I had feeling I barely done anything and decades already have passed.

Super profundo, con textos muy interesantes de leer y diálogos que van de la mano y te invitan a pensar y reflexionar como modo de relax entre puzzle y puzzle. La trama te mantiene al pendiente, queres saber que es lo correcto, que sos, quien es bueno, quien es malo, quien tiene una forma de pensar que se alinea más con la tuya, varios elementos que suman muchísimo a la calidad en mi opinión.
El gameplay no se queda atras, buenos puzzles, buen mix entre complejos y otros no tantos sin dejar de ser interesantes.

HuniePop has great style of art and music. Game play also quite challenging but as a F.ping material HuniePop can not score it well.

As you can read definition from developer. That is true but because of that it could not worth as F.ping material. The puzzle is difficult.

Wonderful Scene

Compare to it's difficulty it is bland. it just a picture with nothing special. To be fare in bonus round someone who is enjoy much in arouse and moan sound you may find paradise there. I don't need to talk about the art style anyone can see that.

사실상 2015년 스팀에 진출한 첫 국산 인디 게임이다.

게임의 분위기 형성이 굉장히 잘 되있다!!! 스토리텔링도 잘 되어있고, 그래픽도 괜찮은 수준이다. 거기에 음악이 정말 예술이다! 은근히 이런 퍼즐 게임 하면서 느끼게 되는 점이지만, 스테이지 놓고 고민하고 있을 때 음악이 안 좋으면 이게 꽤나 거슬릴 때가 많다. 하지만 룸즈: 불가능한 퍼즐은 음악이 상당히 좋아 스테이지 놓고 생각하는 동안 보다 마음이 더 편해진다. 이런 부분들은 스팀에 있는 다른 인디게임들에 비교해봐도 전혀 꿀릴 것이 없다!

게임이 많이 어렵다. 정말 많이. 특히나 퍼즐 3개를 노릴거면 더욱 크게 느껴질 부분이다. 게임의 기본 조작 방식을 설명해주는 초반부만 지나고나면 게임이 많이 어려워진다. 컨트롤같은 피지컬이 별로 필요하지 않고(전혀 필요없는 건 아니다.) 머리를 써야하는 퍼즐이 압도적으로 많다. 그리고 그 머리를 써야 하는 퍼즐의 난이도가 그야말로 장난이 아니다. 아직 공략도 제대로 올라와있지 않아 결국 전부 스스로 해결해야 해서 더욱 힘들다. 물론 그마만큼 퍼즐을 풀어냈을 때의 쾌감도 엄청나다는 이야기이기도 하다.

최근에 업데이트가 한 번 되서 사소한 버그들이 조금 잡힌 듯 하지만, 아직 신경쓰이는 버그들이 조금 있다. 특히 4맨션과 4맨션 지하 쪽으로 접어들게 되면 더욱 절실히 느껴지는 부분. 이전엔 횟수 설정도 잘못되어 있어서 퍼즐 3조각 얻는게 불가능한 곳이 있었는데, 이건 업데이트 때 수정이 되었다. 피드백도 빠른 편.

아주 걸작이라고 하긴 그래도, 이 정도면 충분히 아주 잘 만들어진 수작이라 할 수 있을 것이다. 게임이 발매되었음에도 불구하고 저조한 인기 때문인지 스팀 메인에 오르지 못해 홍보가 잘 되지 않고 있지만, 이런 훌륭한 게임이 빛을 못 보고 있는 건 조금 안타깝다. 그만큼 그래픽/사운드적으로 보나 게임성 자체로 보나 매우 훌륭한 게임이다. 앞으로 더욱 많은 국산 인디 게임들이 스팀에 진출할텐데, 이 게임이 첫 스타트를 잘 끊어준 듯 하다. 대한민국 인디계는 미래가 밝다.

While its deep strategic gameplay, rich narrative, and stunning visuals make it a compelling choice for strategy enthusiasts, the technical problems make it a frustrating and often unplayable experience. If you have a high-end system and can overlook these issues, it can still be rewarding. However, for those with lower-end systems, it might be best to steer clear. | Fun with mods, Really a great game in my opinion and if you are a big fan of the roman empire then this and rome 2 are the games for you | No, just no.

76561198192893105,266510,Hand of Fate,5.5,"Action, Indie, RPG",6,"As with HoF2, Hand of Fate delivers an unprecedented and unique mix between deckbuilder, dungeon crawler, and action RPG. Also as with HoF2, there are glaring flaws in the implementation of mechanics, this time particularly with the Chance Card game and the action RPG combat itself.  
My issue with the Chance Cards is that it is the only minigame you have available to you. HoF2 rectifies this by introducing several others that aren't almost entirely RNG or perception-based: some moreso, some less so, but it all balances out. You also have a greater variety of equipment for dealing with or ""gaming"" certain minigame types. Hand of Fate has maybe two pieces of equipment that will help contribute to your success at Chance Cards.  
The action RPG combat is by far the WORST part of the game. While it's fluid and more dynamic (more options) in HoF2, HoF's combat is plagued by HORRIBLE camera movement and maneuverability of character. Too many times have I gotten stuck on a piece of terrain, surrounded by multiple enemies, and stunlocked by unavoidable attacks. On top of that, enemy HP feels much tankier than HoF2, which draws out combat encounters long enough that I began to feel the game was no longer respecting my time.  
Altogether, at this point in the game's life, I would have to say skip this one and try out HoF2 instead. While that entry has its own share of problematic features, they are not insurmountable, and the breadth of equipment and card types available allow you to take a more tailored approach towards the game's various encounters and challenges.  
Edit: Another thing I wanted to touch on is how some of the token chains for encounter cards feel REALLY unbalanced, requiring you to either repeatedly draw and complete the card's challenge with increasing requirements AND harder Chance Cards, or complete at least three Chance Card challenges with success or Huge Success. This is frustrating and a huge turn-off, but what I've come to understand is Defiant Development LOVES implementing things like this, as they were complained about also by users when HoF2 was fresh, and some things had to be nerfed. Engage with these cards at your own risk of sanity. | O jogo em si é bem legal, Já a platina é cansativa pra porra | очень интересная задумка, хорошая реализация, но ты умрёшь. тебя убьёт либо тупость героя, когда вместо того, чтобы атаковать стоящего рядом врага, герой начнёт давать пощёчины лежащему телу, пока ему уже летит топор, чтобы расколоть пустую черепушку, либо голод , потому что толпа крестьян не взяла половину еды и забрала всё, харкнув тебе в рожу, или же ты умрёшь чисто по приколу, потому что  тебе из-за экрана кинули сквозь тела стоящих противников нож, который ты не смог парировать, ведь щит у тебя слямзили два события назад , когда ты бухал с очень сильной, очень независимой, но очень несчастной алкоголичкой | Really good and really hard.

76561198192893105,298630,The Escapists,0.5,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",0,"A Great Concept, But Poor Execution

I’ve owned this game for a long time, and every now and then, I come back to it, hoping I’ll finally enjoy it. The concept is incredibly appealing, I want to like it. But every time I try, I just can’t. Here’s why.

Frustrating Durability System:
Item durability is absurdly low. Imagine buying a screwdriver from a hardware store, only for it to break after unscrewing just four screws. That manufacturer would go out of business instantly! Even if it were a makeshift tool (which it isn’t), real-life improvised screwdrivers aren’t this flimsy.

Instead of focusing on planning and escaping, you’re stuck in an endless cycle of grinding for the same easily-breakable items over and over. That’s not engaging, it’s tedious.

Guards & Watchtowers Feel Unfair: 
Guards wake up way too quickly, and from what I can tell, you can’t even hide their bodies. You can’t permanently take them out, and if you loot them, they instantly report you. Combine that with watchtowers that snipe you with near-aimbot precision instantly from across the map, sometimes seemingly out of nowhere, and it creates an experience that feels more frustrating than strategic.

Never Made It Past the First Level:
I don’t even remember how much I paid for this game whether it was full price or on sale but regardless, I never got past the first level. Technically, I might have gotten my ""money's worth"" in terms of playtime, but I never enjoyed that time.

And before anyone says it’s a skill issue I’ve beaten plenty of strategy and stealth games on their hardest difficulties. This game just doesn’t click.

Holding Out Hope for The Escapists 2
That said, I love the idea behind this game, which is why I picked up The Escapists 2 on a deep discount. If it fixes these issues and maybe even includes the first game’s levels it could finally be the experience I was hoping for. Maybe prison architect's escape mode is better aswell, I own that game aswell but never gave it a proper try.

Кроме того, порог вхождения очень крутой, учиться взаимодействовать с этой игрой- всё равно что учиться играть на фортепиано | Unreal World é um jogo de sobrevivência em mundo aberto que desafia os limites da paciência e da habilidade dos jogadores. Lançado em 1992, este título pioneiro ofereceu uma experiência de jogo única e brutalmente realista, antecipando muitos dos elementos que se tornaram comuns nos jogos de sobrevivência modernos.

Um Mundo Hostil e Implacável

Em Unreal World, os jogadores são lançados em um ambiente selvagem e implacável, onde a natureza é a maior inimiga. A fome, a sede, a temperatura, os animais selvagens e as doenças são apenas alguns dos perigos que ameaçam a sobrevivência do personagem. Cada decisão, por menor que seja, pode ter consequências drásticas.

Desafios Incessantes

O jogo não oferece tutoriais ou instruções detalhadas. Os jogadores precisam aprender por tentativa e erro, experimentando diferentes ferramentas e estratégias para sobreviver. A curva de aprendizado é íngreme, e a morte é uma constante ameaça.

Características que tornam Unreal World um desafio:

Realismo brutal: O jogo simula de forma realista as necessidades básicas do corpo humano, como fome, sede e temperatura.
Mundo aberto e sem limites: Os jogadores podem explorar um mundo vasto e perigoso, sem restrições ou áreas seguras.
Curva de aprendizado íngreme: A falta de tutoriais e a complexidade do sistema de jogo exigem que os jogadores aprendam rapidamente ou morram.
Recursos escassos: A comida, a água e outros recursos são limitados, forçando os jogadores a gerenciar cuidadosamente seus suprimentos.
Perigos constantes: A natureza, os animais selvagens e outros jogadores (em servidores multiplayer) são ameaças constantes.
Um Legado duradouro

Apesar de sua idade, Unreal World continua a influenciar os jogos de sobrevivência modernos. Títulos como Rust e Minecraft devem muito à visão pioneira deste clássico dos anos 90.

Para quem é Unreal World?

Unreal World é um jogo para jogadores experientes que buscam um desafio extremo. Aqueles que apreciam jogos de sobrevivência hardcore, com um alto grau de realismo e pouca mão na roda, certamente encontrarão em Unreal World uma experiência única e gratificante.

Em resumo:

Unreal World é um jogo que não perdoa erros. Se você está pronto para enfrentar um desafio brutal e desbravar um mundo selvagem e implacável, este jogo é para você. No entanto, esteja preparado para morrer... muitas vezes. | I discovered that you could stab children and I almost got killed for it. 10/10"

Back when I got it for my PS, my family kept telling me to ""just get a PC already"" because PS prices were (and maybe still are?) more expensive than PC prices. Honestly, I have no idea how PS game prices stack up against PC games these days, but I have zero regrets; this game was just too much fun.

I vividly recall pausing mid-story for ages just to mess around in free roam. Roaring, turning into dinosaurs, and doing all kinds of random, silly stuff; it was pure joy for me back in the day. Half the time, I didn’t even care about making progress because it was so much fun just playing around. This game was pure bliss and a big part of why gaming felt so magical back then.

Ignore the low hour count for now, because I fully plan to start fresh on my PC once my setup (and life in general) is sorted. Oh, and as a huge fan of the Jurassic World and Jurassic Park movies, this game hits all the right notes. I highly recommend it. | Eu gostei de tudo do jogo e tudo bom historia mas a dublagem do irmao mais velho em Jurassic World pareceu muito desproporcional para ele de resto o kogo e perfeito | un gioco fantastico, per un appassionato di dinosauri come me è perfetto,per non parlare delle scene,della grafica ma soprattutto per il gamplay | For LEGO fans, this is a decent entry. There are certainly better options to 100%, but the collectathon aspect was pretty fun! I didn't encounter any major bugs, and the collectibles themselves were easy to track.

The moment I saw that ""Dig-Site Kid"" was a playable character, I knew there would be no reference not made. I'm a little disappointed that there weren't any references to the original Michael Crichton novels, but I'm not sure how rights work in that regard. 

TL;DR a fun LEGO game to complete but not entirely memorable. You'll get way more out of this as a JP fan. | Fun twist on the movies.  Gameplay is entertaining and humorous.

When you have a lot of citizens producing a lot of trash it is very hard to stop it from happening since the garbage landfills barely do anything, and when it happens for too long more abandoned buildings will show up which are really annoying to bulldoze. 
      
     People who like to be the leader and take charge, like me, would enjoy playing Cities:Skylines 2. I really enjoy the fact that whenever your bored you can just start a new world and flood your city with poo.
     
     You can do everything from creating road plans to raising taxes, laying down pipe to terraforming an entire mountain surrounding your city. This game is definitely for those aspiring to be an engineer but don't want the complexity of it.

      All in all Cities:Skylines 1 is a great game for beginners learning to be a engineer but for people who want better graphics, mechanics, building, and plays on windows, definitely go for Cities:Skylines 2.

However, in reality, it's the closest thing to a drug addiction. I love the simple joy of just driving, the game itself, the amazing mod support, and the fantastic community!

BUT: The driving and traffic mechanics often feel dull and repetitive, missing the depth and realism that a more sophisticated AI could provide. The AI frequently fails to effectively manage traffic congestion, offering only minimal solutions, which can be quite frustrating. Implementing a smarter, more customizable AI system would significantly improve the experience. Another major drawback is the physics engine, which lacks realism and responsiveness and need some mods to fix that.

76561198192893105,362890,Black Mesa,2.283333333333333,"Action, Adventure, Indie",3,"After 8 years collecting dust in my library, I finally managed to play this masterpiece.
While the first part of the game is a meticulously crafted remake of the original [i]Half-Life[/i], with the Xen chapter they truly made it their own game. Pushing the Source engine to its absolute limits, life on Xen has never been this beautiful. It brings some of the HL2 feeling to the original game and expands on the lore for a much more complete and fleshed-out end game experience. Finishing this game actually brings significance to G-Man's words and makes it feel like an actual achievement.
Just be aware that this game has some soul-rending completionist achievements on hand that make you question your life choices if you decide to get them The Real Way™ and some technical issues on Linux that are better documented on ProtonDB.
Though this didn't affect my enjoyment of the game and would still highly recommend it as a way to relive Half-Life in a modern way, without even speaking of the great Workshop additions people have come up with and multiplayer support this game brings to the table. | Наконец-то руки добрались до этого шедевра, уж очень понравилось)) 
Я больше фанат двойки, а первый HALF LIFE играл очень давно, во времена динозавров на пиратке, и тут BLACK MESA ремейк первой части от сторонних разрабов, игра 2 года находилась у меня не пройденной в библиотеке, в итоге я ее прошел и не пожалел. 

Очень понравился визуал, все выглядит очень бодро, а в моментах через чур красиво, что просто останавливаешься и по минут 15 не двигаешься и залипаешь красивыми видами, на столько хорошо поработали над картинкой.
Геймплей типичный для халвы, я бы сказал, что от второй части отличие только оружие, тут его побольше и сделано красиво, плавные анимации приятные глазу, стрельба не уровня COD 2019, но достойная.
Игра хорошо оптимизирована, у меня не было не багов, не просадок. 

Видел люди жалуются на вылеты, просадки, долгую загрузку карт по 15 минут, вообще из этого ничего не было. А у меня то еще палеозойское чучело, которое потянуло эту игру на почти максималках, как по мне тут даже карты грузились побыстрее чем во второй части. Некоторые вообще думают, что карты из gmod'а, серьезно ? Играл на многих картах, даже самые качественные карты и рядом не стоят с картами из Black Mesa. ""В игре очень темно, я чего это в хорор играю, а разрабы?"", да это в первую очередь шутер, но и хорор тоже, людей не смущает что вообще в игре происходит, а происходит откровенное мясо, везде трупы и зомбари вместе с пришельцами, темные моменты наоборот нагоняет жути как и должно быть.

[b]ЗЕН[/b] - Очень красиво воссоздали Зен, прям ну конфетка, казалось бы все окей, но есть одно но, и в этом я уже соглашусь с большей частью мнений, мир Зен в первой части half life, был ну буквально на 30 минут или чуть больше и состоял он из летающих островков и все, разработчики Мезы сделали Зен со своей флорой и фауной, куда не глянь кто-то на кого-то охотится, кто-то кого-то жрет, и визуально прям ну очень красиво и опасно одновременно. Понравилось как показали вертигонтов уже с другой стороны и здесь более ясно, что их поработили, то как они занимаются разработкой суперсолдат из себя же блин, было жаль их, и тут им я даже как то сочувствовал, чего не было в оригинале.
Но... но есть одно но, зен ну очень растянут, прям до нельзя, тут и правда были моменты когда хотелось ливнуть и снести  игру к чертям, то ты прыгаешь по всяким платформам, то ты прыгаешь по платформам и там уже враги, то там уже прыгаешь и уворачиваешься от лазеров и убиваешь противников, и так блин почти час или больше, вот тут уже прям жирнющий минус в сторону Зена. Но это был основной и один минус как по мне, все остальное прям на высоте и круто, а то, что это сделали по факту фанаты с таким качеством, вот он пример, как нужно делать ремейки, да Rockstar? 

Black Mesa - Красивая и проработанная игра, видно, что разработчики уважают вселенную Half life, к тому это пример того как нужно делать игры. 12 из 10 | I was honestly not expecting to dislike this as much as I did, as Half-Life is one of my favorite games of all time. I went into Black Mesa expecting just a nice graphical face lift, and instead experienced change after change that I feel genuinely fell short of the still unmatched experience that is Half-Life. 

Movement and gunplay immediately felt off to me. While I understand the game does not run on the same engine as the original, the intrinsic feel of movement and weapon firing was something I didn't realize was so well done in Half-Life until playing Black Mesa. Weapons lack the punch and “character” that made them all so satisfying to use. This is made glaringly clear by the game's sound design, which is passable but outright pales in comparison to Half-Life 1. 

Combat also feels strange. Enemy AI seems to always have perfect aim while moving, resulting in the player resorting to quick peeks from cover to preserve health and shields. This was super unfun compared to the ability to run-and-gun and think on the fly in the original. Combat itself felt like a puzzle in the original Half-Life, but it feels more like a generic shooter in Black Mesa.

While I found the soundtrack on its own to be well composed and enjoyable, it didn't fit the tone and mood of Half-Life at all. The industrial rock and techno edges are gone. Instead, more generic action/cinematic songs take its place. I'd argue that Half-Life's soundtrack is vital to setting its tone, so this was a real sore spot for me. I get that they most likely couldn't just re-use the same OST, but it felt like there wasn't any significant attempt to recreate that industrial sound that permeates the cold, chromatic halls of the Black Mesa facility.

As many others have noted, Xen is a real slog. I enjoyed how it started and appreciated it's differences in level design, but I didn't care for the more Avatar-esque interpretation of the border world. The original Xen had an almost HR Giger feel to it that, like the tone of the OST, was completely stripped away. The second to last chapter falls apart into the most mind numbingly rudimentary “final level,” which grossly overstays its welcome and almost makes you forget what game you're playing. The long-winded and bloated design choices are baffling here, especially considering the fact that On A Rail was totally gutted for pacing reasons, apparently. While Xen in the original was ultimately nothing to write home about, it served its purpose succinctly and still capped off the game neatly and without making me feel utterly checked out and exhausted.

Black Mesa was ultimately a very odd game for me. It ended up in a sort of no man's land, where it simultaneously tried to stay true to the source material while also trying to dramatically change things in order to differentiate itself from its source material. The result is a game that, while STILL an impressive project despite my dislike for many of its elements, could never escape comparisons to Half-Life, and the constant feeling that this remake didn't offer an experience anywhere near improved over the original. 

I know I'm being really critical here, but I don't think Black Mesa is a terrible game nor do I think it's not worth experiencing. What I am saying is that Black Mesa should not be considered a replacement for the original Half-Life 1 in any way, shape, or form. It is best played at some point after completing the original and its subsequent expansions (well, at least just Opposing Force). But as it stands, the best way to experience Half-Life is still, unquestionably, by playing Half-Life. | It's an incredible achievement all around.  They recreated the mood and vibe of Half Life, while adding in more character and depth. The environments make more sense, and connect to each other in a more coherent way, the introductions of enemies is much more artful, and the voice acting and dialogue is really well done which is  so rare for community projects.
Half Life 1 may be a masterpiece of it's time and it's worth giving it a go, but this can easily stand in as a replacement as many of the original innovations of Half Life 1 are now commonplace in most shooters. The atmosphere and tone is so well realised that it feels as if the Half Life 2 developers made it themselves.
Possibly the best community made game in history, certainly the best community made mod in history.
Play it. | [h1] Грандиозный ремонт [/h1]

Первой Half-Life почти 30 лет. Даже несмотря на мою любовь к старине, играть в неё уже крайне проблематично. А для тех, кому привычна и другая картинка, и осознание, что игра старше игрока - тут уж совсем тяжко. Black Mesa выросла из мода. Взять движок Half-Life 2, который и сейчас смотрится весь приятно, и переставить первую часть на вторую. Только с огромным количеством улучшений, на разработку которых потратили 15 лет.

Довольно долгая сюжетная кампания, где шутер частенько отходит на второй план. Головоломками этот игровой процесс с трудом можно назвать. Скорее, внимательно смотреть надо, куда прыгаешь и забираешься. Есть даже пара уровней, где в основном игрок именно этим и занимается, стреляя крайне редко. Но и стрельба тут очень приятная, а борьба с противниками интересная. Да, противники нередко пытаются задавить Вас мясом, но и часто используют укрытия, бросают гранаты или пытаются откуда-нибудь подальше атаковать, чтобы игрок не сразу смог ответить. Арсенал достаточно внушительный, каждое оружие требует своего подхода и многие орудия имеют альтернативный режим стрельбы. 

Ну и отдельного восхищения заслуживает мир Зен. Невероятная красота! Большие и интересные уровни, на которых, опять-таки, перемешаны и шутер, и ""головоломки"". Правда, последнее на Зене может слегка утомить - слишком, пожалуй, долго придётся карабкаться и прыгать.

В игре есть как и сюжетный режим, так и мультиплеер, да ещё и своя мастерская.

Прекрасный мод, который совершенно заслужено перерос в самостоятельную игру!"

The game has a pretty steep learning curve, does not hold your hand, or offer much in the form of guidance.  But it is oh so rewarding when you do get the hang of it and are able to take on the more challenging battles the game has to offer.

-Get your first contract

I cannot stress enough how much I recommend starting on the beginner difficulty, otherwise there is a high chance you will rage quit and conclude that the game is poorly balanced. Even on beginner, there will be times where it feels like the RNG is legitimately out to get you, but other times it feels like a miracle how much it seems to be in your favor. 

It's a hard game and you will likely find yourself reloading saves but its also a quite well made and in depth turn based combat game. It feels very rewarding as you evolve from a group of losers barely scraping by to a small army full of hardened combatants. | This game is pretty much turn based mount and blade, which is not really a good thing. Like M&B, I had fun for awhile, until i realized that there is nothing tactical about the game and every battle becomes pretty repetitive. The game starts every battle with your sides in two lines within almost one turns movement distance. Very tactical. I know I would deploy my guys right up there within range of archers. The terrain for each battle is generated upon entering the battle, so you may start the battle with your back against a hill. Did my guys march right down a hill and start battle at the foot of the hill my enemies are on. Very Tactical. The game kind of treats armor and shields as a second health bar, so it just becomes swinging attrition. The only bonus you get for placement of troops is a mild accuracy bonus. Mild. So you surround a guy with a shield and he somehow blocks every swing with a shield until the shield is destroyed. Then do the same for armor. Tactical as hell. Yes some weapons deal more damage to shields or armor, but ultimately it is still a very shallow ""tactical"" experience. | Fun Game! Challenging, with a learning curve to it. Not crazy though. On the surface seems simple, but takes some time to learn the depth. I am still getting the hang of it. If you like turn based games, with depth, then this is the game for you."

It has a few flaws: Firstly, notes taking up RAM, let alone a lot of RAM. I sort of get what the devs were going for here, but all it does is encourage the player to pull  up a notepad on their second monitor, especially in the endgame when you need to juggle passwords and IP addresses for upwards of a dozen machines. Secondly, the node map. It's a cool concept but its insanely cluttered and unusable, to the point where the DLC gives you a way to sort it, so the devs know its a problem. but you just have to deal with it until you beat the dlc (intended to be played late in the main story)

There is the added bonus of workshop content and being able to create your own campaigns as well. | Fun text-based adventure game that emulates old-school hacking in a very movie-like way. There's a few adrenaline rushing moments and surprising events. It's not for everyone, but I enjoyed it greatly."

Отличная (8 из 10)

P.S.: Расшифровка:

Трэш — знакомиться с игрой рекомендуется исключительно тем, кто в диком восторге от описания, скриншотов и продолжительности. Остальным, из контакта с этой игрой, только тыкать палкой, как ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ку на дороге.

Так себе — в основном, эта игра предлагает меньше, чем вы увидите из описания и скриншотов. Рекомендуется только тем, кому вышеперечисленные критерии окажутся «зашибись».

Нормальная — неплохая игра своего жанра. Сами судите по описанию, скриншотам и продолжительности. Игра, примерно, соответствует своему наполнению.

Хорошая — весьма неплохой представитель своего жанра. Многие могут найти тут «свой шедевр». Зачастую, игра приятно соответствует своему описанию и скриншотам.

Отличная — эти игры, зачастую, превосходят свои первые впечатления, основанные на описании и скриншотах (в расчёт не берём репутацию, ибо «тот кто знает, тот поймёт»). Отличные представители своего жанра. | Fun but hard little sidescroller action game. Worth grabbing on sale! | Divertido y con una dificultad apropiada para quien disfruta de los retos."

/ The voice acting is, with a few exceptions, pretty nicely done. There was only one character whose voice I found annoying or whose voice acting done in a cheesy manner.
/ The art is good, only had one instance where it seemed noticeably bad but there was nothing extraordinary either.
/ The dialogue is nicely written, there are hardly any mistakes throughout the game and the characters talk realistically, as humans would. Well, as realistic as it can get for a game of this sort which is bound to have at least somewhat stereotypical and quite flat characters.
/ There are a bunch of endings, a few of which are very similar but over-all, the game's story gets really complex on some routes and not so much on others. Some endings are sorta unexpected. I don't see that as a bad thing, as I'd firstly completed some of the shorter routes, unknowingly, to later discover how much more there was to the story. All in all, when you fit the pieces, there aren't really any plot holes or discordances and the story all ties in really neatly.
/ The bloopers are cute af.
/ The character you play isn't a dislikeable cunt.
/ At first the story is slightly ridiculous and random but it gets a more mature vibe as you play and I'd say it managed to make me take it seriously for at least two playthroughs. | This didn't like at first, but as I play more of it. I did like. I recommend playing it if you like these types of games. I recommend even playing Amnesia Memories and other Otome games. | First off,This Review is coming from someone that has just started getting into to this genre of games.I would like to say I have fully played the game and have even gotten all the achievements. When I saw it was free in the store I mostly got it because I was board.Though with that in mind I was not disappointed. There were some things i did not like about it because some endings felt really similar, but others blew me away with how in depth they went. I thoughly enjoyed this story and found it really interesting I can not wait to get the sequel and I hope it is just as good or hopefully better. I felt the artstyle really worked for this game. I would like to give this game a 9.5/10 rating because of the stuff mentioned here but don't go by my rating just try the game because its free to play. | Honestly, I did not expect much since it was a free game. But good Lord this game had me laughing my ass off, facepalming really really hard and blushing and grinning like an idiot. The story is very well written and the love routes are so sweet and romantic they had me melting! Also props to the voice actors! They did such an amazing job on this game, I love it. I can't wait to get the other endings as well. Even considering buying the second part since it's recommended a lot.

Tip: Check the bloopers when you unlock them! You'll be rolling on the floor laughing very very hard. I promise ;) | This game was fun. The beginning was a bit slow, some of the art work forshortining is a bit awkward and not all of the voice acters are the best.

Bought this game and beat it in a 2 hour session, just love love love this game ! 

Impossible to lose at this game unless you are not crafty and able to read the storyline well !!! | It's not hard to see why this game is still considered a classic, even for those who aren't superfans of the point and click adventure genre. I played Maniac Mansion on NES years ago and loved it, and while this game is a bit of a departure from it (you don't build a party at the beginning, the three characters don't interact in the same environments), it brings a lot of fun new elements to the table, like the amazing voicework (apart from Laverne, who feels almost comatose by comparison).

The graphics (I played the ""retro version"", which I'd recommend) are fun and colorful and cartoony, and remind me distinctly of Earthwork Jim. One of my few complaints about the game is the sound design; it's full to bursting with all manner of rehashed Saturday morning cartoon sound effects, which work fine, but the background music is drab and uninteresting. I only bring it up because Maniac Mansion had some of the best music of any game of any generation.

The game does have some intensely moon brain puzzle logic, but in my experience if you're playing a tongue-in-cheek cartoony point and click game, that's part of the package. One of the achievements, which you get after a particularly implausible puzzle, is actually called ""Oh yeah, I'm playing a cartoon"".

This game isn't for everyone, just as this genre isn't for everyone. But if it's For You, you'll know it. | Geniales Remaster eines der besten Adventures.

I have not seen anything removed or changed in any bad way. It is the same game - but with better graphics. Also there is a possibility of having some of the creaters comment as you play along. That is a huge feature in itself.

Perhaps it appeals less to people not familiar with DotT. But if so it is a more modern way to play the game.

It is a very well meant and well made remaster of a fantastic game."

You can achieve different endings based on how you interact with the characters.  The underlining story is really creepy but not too gruesome.  I liked the whole experience even though this type of game is not my norm.

游戏里的屠杀结局，是对人性黑暗面的直白审视。在这个走向里，玩家选择对遇到的怪物赶尽杀绝，每一次攻击都伴随着怪物的痛苦与绝望。游戏画面随着杀戮推进，逐渐染上压抑的色调，音乐也变得扭曲阴森。最终，玩家会面对一个孤独且荒芜的世界，曾经生机勃勃的地下王国沦为死寂废墟，只剩无尽悔恨与空虚。这个结局以极端的方式警示玩家，暴力与冷漠只会带来毁灭，让我们反思自身行为对周围世界的影响。
 
和平路线则截然不同，它是一曲爱与理解的赞歌。玩家摒弃武器，用耐心、真诚与怪物交流，挖掘出每个角色背后温暖人心的故事。游戏氛围也从最初的紧张转为温馨，音乐轻快明亮，充满希望。在这个结局中，玩家不仅化解了怪物与人类之间的千年仇恨，还让地下世界重归安宁与和谐。它向我们展示了善良、包容的力量，让我们坚信爱能跨越一切障碍。
 
中立结局处于二者之间，充满了未知与变数。玩家的每一次抉择都可能改变故事走向，怪物的命运在玩家一念之间或喜或悲。这一结局凸显了游戏的自由与开放，强调玩家的选择具有决定性意义，每个人都能在游戏中书写属于自己的独特篇章。
 
《传说之下》通过三种结局，为玩家带来了丰富的情感体验与深刻的人生思考。它证明了游戏不仅是娱乐，更是一种强大的叙事与表达媒介，值得每一位热爱游戏的玩家深入探索。 | [h1]One of the first games I've ever played and is such an experience.[/h1]

Going into this game, I didn't really have any expectations, I only knew it from gaming youtubers of the past generation (pewdiepie etc.,) so I knew that it is popular, but did not have any idea on what to expect from the game, played it without seeing any description, screenshots, nor reviews. Turns out, up to this date, it is still the most enjoyable game I've ever played and I'll forever be a fan of such a wonderful piece of artwork in the gaming community."

It may not be for everyone because of its focus on the plot rather than focusing on gameplay. I personally like playing these types of games from time to time, so for the most part, story driven games boil down to your preference. I think this is a really good game, and it is worth while!

The only cons I have for the game is that some of the sound effects were taken straight out of Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. Some sounds will loop in the background and can get annoying to listen to. And finally, the monster in the game is not very threatening, and is easily avoided by simply not going near her. But, that won't be an issue since you can literally out-walk them.

For the most part, it's a decent little horror game. It's very short! You can easily beat the game in under two hours on a first play-through, so it's a good game to pass some time if your in the horror mood.

I'd give this game a solid 7/10. | [h2] 步步惊险的步行模拟器 [/h2]

Ceder ante esa banda de tóxicos pseudojusticieros a buen seguro que a la larga ha sido todo un palo para la desarrolladora y la publicadora, porque dudo que los wokes empezaran a comprar el juego tras la censura.

Hay que tener en cuenta que los anteriores desarrolladores introdujeron algo de censura, pero los nuevos cogieron la tijera de podar y se han puesto a eliminar cosas que no tienen sentido, porque si bien se parodia al régimen nazi, nunca se los pone como a los buenos de la película, y si bien las escenas introductorias de Big Band eran muy duras, en ningún momento mostraban aquello como algo digno de elogio y/o a imitar, sino todo lo contrario. Sí, Skullgirs era un juego gamberro, pero eso era parte de su alma y nadie estaba obligado a comprar el juego.

En resumidas cuentas y viendo que me han cambiado el producto que compré, me veo en la obligación de suspenderlo. Tras todo lo publicado, posiblemente alguno pensará que soy otro zombi de la alt-right, pero nada más lejos de la realidad. Soy una persona con unas profundas convicciones de izquierdas, pero claro, cometo el pecado de ser una persona muy de los 90 del siglo pasado, y siendo un español descendiente de personas que huyeron de la dictadura franquista, me deja perplejo que parte de la izquierda actual viva obsesionada con reinstaurar una censura más bien propia de un dictador al que presuntamente desprecian. | i dont know what half of the mechanics are but holy shit big band and beowulf are peak masculinity even while being the only 2 male characters in a game full of females with huge badongadongs | Jogo muito bem feito, mas só recomendo pra quem não fica de mimimi pra qualquer coisa. | This is the perfect example of a fighting game that's clearly well-made but not for me.

What started off as an indie game is clearly inspired by Marvel vs. Capcom, and it shows. A lot of the mechanics follow the typical team-based fighting game style with assists. The main gimmick I like is that you can (in theory) pick only 2 or even 1 character and have your health scale up, but generally, this is not recommended.

The character designs certainly ""stick out,"" but I've personally never been into the art style of Skullgirls; it definitely has that ""early Western indie game"" feel.

While the game is kind of fun to mess around with solo, I just don't think it's as enjoyable or polished as later (or even earlier) team games when playing against any competition. The balance is super whack and heavily reliant on combos and Touch of Death mechanics, with not many good defensive options.

The story mode is amusing enough, and I'm glad it's fully voiced, but I just didn't really care about any of the characters by the end, even though I completed all the story modes (in the Switch version).

When this game was one of the few to actually use GGPO rollback netcode, I might have given it a more positive recommendation. However, with so many more dynamic, better-looking, balanced, and more fun-to-play versions of anime-style/team-based fighting games available now, Skullgirls just doesn't hold up for me personally these days.

I do have to give props for showing that indie fighting games can be a thing, especially lasting over a decade. | This is quite simply, mechanically, the best tag fighter on the market and it came out in 2012.  that says a lot.  tier lists? useless.

76561198192893105,57300,Amnesia: The Dark Descent,0.7666666666666667,"Action, Adventure, Indie",1,"Прошёл данную шикарную и легендарную игру целых 4 раза. Здесь прекрасно абсолютно все.

Атмосфера здесь на высоте. Постоянный мрак, какие-то скрипы, звуки криков и ко всему этому периодически проявляющиеся воспоминания главного героя о его призраках прошлого. Звуковое и музыкальное сопровождение также очень гармонично подчеркивают происходящее на экране. Периодически, по ходу игры, в голове героя всплывают различные сцены с диалогами, которые, в общем-то, проливают свет на его историю. Также по ходу прохождение предстоит собираться многочисленные записки, из которых можно узнать много интересного. 

Сама история игры и сюжет кажутся простыми и лаконичными, но при этом очень яркими и насыщенными, благодаря чему за столь небольшой отрезок времени, который занимает полное прохождение игры, возможно в полной мере проникнуться сюжетом и повествованием. Кстати, здесь есть русская озвучка и она очень качественная и аутентичная.

Графика в игре также очень приятная. Все работает очень плавно и без каких-либо багов и прочего. Движок сделан очень качественно, физика в игре хорошо работает на атмосферу во время различных сцен, а у игрока есть возможность перетаскивать и метать многие предметы окружения.

Что касается полного прохождения игры на 100%, а именно - получения всех достижений, то здесь есть пара недостатков. Большинство ачивок смело можно назвать простыми, так как большую их часть дают за сугубо сюжетные моменты, которые обязательно нужно будет сделать по ходу прохождения. С DLC уже нужно быть чуть внимательнее, ибо в нем нет никаких чекпоинтов и его нужно пройти от начала до конца целых три раза (на разные концовки). Но в общем, оно не такое уж и сложное. Единственное, так это то, что если случайно умереть - то вас просто выкинет из игры на рабочий стол, что слегка неудобно. На мой личный взгляд, двумя наиболее неприятными достижениями в Amnesia: TDD являются Illuminatus (на сбор 151 огнива) и Мазохист (прохождение игры на хардкорном режиме). Сбор всех 151 огнив - просто скукотища, а о хардкоре чуть далее.

Теперь несколько слов о хардкор-моде. Я не скажу, что он какой-то прям ультра сложный, скорее наоборот, он достаточно простой. Для начала стоит отметить, что я не фанат таких вот перепрохождений игры с доп. условиями и люблю получать все ачивки за одно прохождение, но это ещё ладно. В хардкорном режиме есть платные сохранения, которые тратят огнива (которых стало в разы меньше). Плюсом ко всему прочему теперь возможно умереть из-за очень низкого уровня рассудка. Это просто максимально растягивает и без того не самое интересно повторное прохождение игры. Особенно, когда ты вынужден стоять и ждать восстановления уровня рассудка возле свечи/факела/окна. Я знаю, что из игры вырезали расходник под названием ""отрезвин"", который мог восполнить уровень рассудка (как опиум здоровье). Отчасти я согласен с разработчиками, что он был вырезан из нормальной сложности. Однако, хочу отметить, что в хард-моде тот же опий не имеет смысла, так как монстры (тени) убивают игрока с одного удара, а какие-либо другие травмы получить до смерти - это ещё нужно постараться.

В общем, несмотря на небольшие недостатки по поводу достижений, игра очень классная и её смело можно назвать классикой жанра хоррор. Рекомендую поиграть в нее всем любителям мрака, отличной атмосферы, а также интересной и насыщенной истории. | Очень классная игра, графика конечно старая, но игре очень много лет как никак, не особо страшная советую к покупке и прохождению. 

100% | Many good things are well presented in this game, but the bad things are also obvious. Amnesia: The Dark Descent is ""a puzzle game"" with a horror theme; not a horror game with puzzles as a side dish. So, if you are a brain-dead person (like me), you are surely not going to make it through this game without a guide as the game gives you very little direction.

The atmosphere is terrific. The sound and character designs are well done. I really like all the elements of this game. However, bad things still exist. First of all, in this game, when the sanity drops, the screen becomes blurry, causing motion sickness and destroying your eyesight; this is very bad, even an FPS gamer like me can barely tolerate it. Secondly, dying makes the game easier; this is a very bad concept for me. Besides these, it is actually a good game. | Playing Amnesia: The Dark Descent in 2025 was an eye-opening experience. Despite its age, it stands tall among modern horror games. The gameplay feels polished, with physics-based interactions that remain impressive. While I’m not the biggest fan of puzzles, the game strikes a great balance. They’re neither too easy nor too hard, and they’re tied to the narrative in ways that make solving them rewarding.

The story is the heart of the game, delivered in a way that’s mysterious and compelling. It kept me curious throughout, as every note and memory revealed critical details. Paying close attention to the story isn’t just enriching, it’s essential. The narrative is layered with meaning, and small decisions can impact the outcome significantly.

While the game isn’t overwhelmingly scary, perhaps due to my higher scare tolerance, the tension is palpable. The NPCs are faster than you, so running is often your only option. This mechanic, coupled with the eerie atmosphere, keeps you on edge. One standout feature is the immediate feedback when solving puzzles, which subtly confirms you’re on the right track without breaking immersion.

It’s funny to think I discovered this classic through PewDiePie years ago. The rich story, creative gameplay, and immersive design make it a must-play, even today. Modern horror games could learn a lot from Amnesia’s creativity and depth.

Rating: 9/10. Playing it in 2025 was absolutely worth the time. | Не рекомендую 👎
Долго думал как оценить игру по достоинству, но после двойного прохождения основной игры + DLC и всех ачивок всё стало однозначно. Изначально я давал фору ведь у игры большая фан база,огромные оценки и вышла она в 2010 году, но вспомнил что в это время вышли Mafia 2, Mass Effect 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Heavy Rain,CoD:MW2 достойна ли она находится среди таких культовых игр?Есть ощущение что оценки сильно завышены из-за ностальгии,разберем по фактам сюжет-в начале слегка интригует на деле бессмысленная глупая графомания, графика  в момент выхода на 2010 уже была устаревшей, физика-отличная приятна как в HL2 возможно даже чуть лучше но какой смысл если её удалить ничего не изменится, все локации скучные однообразные и не запоминающиеся, так же скрипты (они везде) просто мобов спавнит где хочет,а отворачиваешься на секунду и он исчез.DLC-это отвратительное абсурдное идиотское убожество в которое что бы зайти надо читать гайды и к сожалению пройти меня заставили ачивки. Про ачивки я тоже ничего хорошего сказать не могу, тебя принуждают пройти линейный хоррор 2 раза ну вот зачем такую глупость добавлять,в общем не пойму чем многим запала в душу игра, возможно сюжетом раскинутым на 300 записочек и скриптовыми мобами а может чем то другим. Лучше поиграйте в Outlast, Alien: Isolation, Soma, Call of Cthulhu:Dark Corners of the Earth первые игры которые пришли в голову."
76561198192893105,404790,Godot Engine,29.416666666666668,Game Development,0,"I've used a lot of game engines in my time. Unreal, Unity, Game Editor, Love2d and out of all of them Godot has become my favorite engine. Considering how simple it is, it's wildly powerful. Once you learn how to use it you feel like you're using a well tuned instrument. I find myself working on features I've never made before and just *knowing* what I need to do to make them. 

I'm not saying it doesn't have a learning curve. It's Scene-inside-a-Scene workflow definitely will take some getting used to. But it helps to just think of Scenes as containers for things that you can use to group stuff into one inside another scene(container). 

After that you can learn to use GDscript and signals in a day. After that you're on your way to being a game dev wiz. I can't wait to see how this engine grows. | First of all I've used Godot much more than 22 hours, just not the Steam version.

Started out disliking Godot because of GDScript but after some weeks with it, the scripting language stopped being an issue.
Other than that, I'd say this engine is well on its way to become a premier RAD (does anyone even use this term anymore ? :D) environment for making games.

Battle-tested in 2 game jams and one LD.

PROS:
[list]
[*]Good level editor, comes with multiple camera manipulation modes (including my favourite, Maya).
[*]Great for 2D games (just as good as other, more expensive, engines)
[*]GDScript offers a tighter integration with the engine than most other scripting engines.
[*]Offers a decent debugger.
[*]Complex properties (matrices, colors) are edited in pop-up boxes and don't clutter the GUI.
[*]Lots of pre-existing components to help with collision, navigation, 2D and 3D tiled levels and more.
[*]Many demos and open source examples that cover a wide range of topics.
[/list]

CONS:
[list]
[*]Complex projects will sometimes crash the editor if you work too fast (e.g. when switching between 2D, 3D and Script editors).
[*]Importing 3D animated models could go smoother.
Because licensing issues prevent Godot from supporting FBX (the industry standard right now), you [b]WILL have to use 3rd party software[/b] to convert assets to COLLADA (.DAE) (Blender, Maya, MAX, etc).
[*]Have to learn a new language (GDScript) but it's syntax is similar to Python.
[/list] | Free to use and doesn't require you to get anything else. I would recommend this to adept users. For those without this cognition or ledger status I would get Game Maker. | easy to use, I dont know how to program for crap, but im waiting on the visual programming to come before I start fully using it | This review of Godot 2.2 was *almost* a positive recommendation.  You can read a lot of the other positive reviews to learn why it's a really good development framework.  (NOTE, 31 March 2018: I have changed the review to a positive review after trying out Godot 3.0 for a few days.)

I was about to choose Godot as the engine for my next game, but then my partner noticed that there were posts dating from over a year ago reporting screen tearing and frame stuttering, and these reports continued up to the present.  (Search for ""godot screen tearing"" to see some of the posts.)

I had not noticed the problem because the scenes we had made for our evaluation project did not have scrolling.  As soon as I added some scrolling to the project, I saw the problems.  Unfortunately, there seems to be no workaround.  Even Godot's own Space Shooter demo has the problems.  Neither turning VSync on (or off) nor enabling pixel snapping helped.  It would sometimes look so bad that one could clearly see the seam flicker between two triangles of a texture.

Once Godot fixes the screen tearing and frame stuttering, I will gladly change my recommendation to ""Yes"", but for now, it's not good for commercial use.  It's still good for personal projects, prototyping, and game jams.

UPDATE (25 Feb): As another test, I created a project with no scrolling.  It was simply a 4-color Sprite node that one could drag around the screen, and the background was a solid color.  If I dragged the sprite rapidly around the top 1/3 of the screen, I would see weird ripples inside the sprite. Slower movement minimized the rippling, but it was still noticeable.  I don't think it's simply a hardware issue because similar behavior does not happen if I recreate the demo in GameMaker, Corona, or Unity.  It seems like a renderer issue to me.  I hope Godot 3's new renderer fixes the problem!

UPDATE (31 March 2018): I tested old projects ported to Godot 3.0, and they worked fine, so I think they've fixed the various problems I had observed.  Therefore, I'm now changing Godot 3.0's review to a ""thumbs up"" because I do like Godot a lot.  I also like a bunch of the new Godot 3.0 features.  If there's one thing I wish they had, it would be integrated Switch development support, but they have sensible reasons why they don't have that (related to open-source status) that are explained on godotengine.org."

 | Quando a gente pensa na vida, às vezes ela parece um pouco sem sentido, não é? A gente corre atrás de metas, objetivos e sonhos, mas no fundo, fica a pergunta: ""qual o real propósito disso tudo?"" Albert Camus, um dos maiores filósofos existencialistas, fala exatamente sobre isso. Ele diz que a vida é absurda ou seja, não tem um grande significado pré estabelecido. Mas ao invés de cairmos no desespero ou na frustração, ele propõe uma atitude de revolta e aceitação: continuar vivendo e buscando pequenas razões para seguir em frente, mesmo sabendo que nada vai dar ""a resposta definitiva"" para o sentido da vida.

É aí que >>>Stardew Valley<<< entra de uma maneira muito interessante. No jogo, a fazenda nunca vai ser 100% perfeita. Mesmo depois de mundo trabalho, sempre vai ter mais coisa para fazer. A colheita pode dar certo em um ano, mas em outro nem tanto por conta do clima não ajudar... As dificuldades não param. No entanto, o que Stardew Valley pode nos ensinar, de forma tranquila e até reconfortante, é que a beleza está exatamente nisso: no processo. Cada pequena conquista cada planta cultivada, cada amizade construída... são essas e entre muitas situações que tornam a jornada significativa.

O simples ato de viver e aproveitar os momentos é o que dá a verdadeira beleza à nossa existência. | 加mod太多以至于玩到后面有点失去初心了，joja流和刘易斯流玩法的好玩之处都没领会到就速通了，感觉自己还是那个见人就送黄水仙花不讨人喜欢的农场主ww，但是还是很喜欢从生疏到熟络的大家，阿比盖尔山姆384三人组99，白天在joja打工晚上抱着鸡买醉的谢恩也很可爱"

Бойова частина доволі простенька, ще простіша ніж в xcom, але зі своїми фішками. Грав на Linux, було пару крашів гри а так без якихось багів.

Не рекомендую цей піс оф щіт | It is exactly what it seems like. An X-com style isometric shooter set in the wild west, mixed with urban fantasy elements. It doesn't try to be anything more, or anything less.

The biggest distinction is it's luck mechanic and heavier narrative focus. What it means is that the chances of you shooting someone or getting shot are a lot more easier to predict and wager, while your engagements are a lot more scripted, less randomized. Also, the posse you get are nearly all scripted, so the game is balanced around that as well. It all makes the game feel a lot more fair, but it also makes it way easier to master and complete than regular x-com, so it may not be appealing to the really hardcore players. But for me it was just right. | I would not recommend this game for people who are looking for a thoughtful, Western X-Com game. Hard West is a mixture of table top game and X-Com like fights but there is something off and janky about the game. I have tried multiple times to beat the Retired Demon, about 2 hours of time tonight and the limitations of the came comes front and center.

The game doesn't allow you to have a manual save or even multiple save states so if you go into a battle scenario under prepared you will lose and lose repeatedly. I cannot heal other team mates, and there is a lack of in mission options for recovering health unless you equip multiple before battles. I also have realized that some of the Playing Card abilities are very finicky, like the eating the dead one that I had equipped on my crazy moonshiner which would only randomly work at times. I would be standing on a tile with a dead enemy and I could not eat the flesh and even after swapping around which tile I was on.

The GUI and interface, the controls are exactly like X-Com and similar game but there was even 3 to 4 hours in an apprehension about ""If I Right click vs Left click is it going to back out on what I was going to do?""

I love the weird West genre, and I love most Westerns too, but this game just left me frustrated. When I tried to back out of the section I was in to see if I could go back a few turns on the table top portion it straight  up just restarted all my progress in that chapter.

I just wish that there was more forethought put into certain aspects of the game play mechanics and the way the game flows. But I will say if you want a crazy tough experience, even with the jankiness, give the game a shot. For people who want a game that doesn't have the extreme jank that I experienced, look elsewhere for your Weird West X-Com."
76561198192893105,418240,Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun,30.016666666666666,"Indie, Strategy",17,"Great strategy stealth game with cute graphics. Feudal Japan settings fits the game like charm and I would not believe that this kind of game will work so flawlessly with controller, so much, that I would not think of going back to m+k. Pity that Mimimi studio, which stands behind the game, closed the offices. | It’s rare to find a game that excels in the pillars of mechanics, storytelling, and art as consistently as Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun. It has its share of blemishes, most prominent of which being camera controls that made me want to flip an entire hibachi table. But its needle-sharp stealth systems, cast of memorable characters with diverse abilities and personalities, and an uncommonly grounded saga set in a stylized feudal Japan left me with a sense of true accomplishment and a role in a well-told story.

Each of Shadow Tactics’ five characters has a particular set of skills that make them suited to different sneaky deeds, like hunkering down in bushes, isolating and executing enemies, and hiding the evidence before anyone notices. There were clearly times that called for Mugen, a samurai who can take out a cluster of enemies in a katana flurry, and times when it was a job for Yuki, a young thief who can lure solo enemies into traps. Other times, using them both in tandem allowed me to achieve what neither could alone, which created some great “Eureka!” moments. |

76561198192893105,426000,HunieCam Studio,2.85,"Indie, Simulation",2,"After completing the game 100%—yes, I even went the extra mile to collect all the wardrobe upgrades that unlock those spicy loading screen splash arts in the main menu—I can confidently say this game stands out from others in its genre. And that’s not a bad thing.

This is one of those rare tycoon games that manages to be both engaging and genuinely fun. Your goal is to get as much money and resources, in this case fans, as possible, and the premise is straightforward: reach a certain number of fans by the end of the month. The characters come with a decent amount of voice lines, and the roster is surprisingly large for a game of this scale.

Playing it for the first time feels rewarding, with plenty of moments to enjoy as you get the hang of it. However, the replayability does take a hit; subsequent playthroughs can feel a bit repetitive, though you’ll undoubtedly perform better each time thanks to the lessons you’ve gained. I recommend you to skip all the tutorials for the real experience, by doing this you unlock all the facilities at the start.

The game is short, but it’s a fun little tidbit that’s worth your time. For fans of this spicy genre, I’d still recommend picking it up when it is in sale, even though it lacks some of the extra spicy cutscenes and features that could’ve taken it to the next level. | This game is actually pretty fun. It takes a few tries to get the hang of how the game works and figure out a strategy for how to get as many fans as possible. Even after getting all the achievements it could still be a lot of fun to go back and see what the highest score you can get is. | Overall

Yeah. I totally agreed that nobody ask for this(it ads said that). it is good to burn time but not F.ping material. the mature content in this game is all reference and talking.

Game Play

It is mad clicking game. You drag thing to drop there then click click click click click, What did I just type here. silly me but that is the game play. And yes it is more difficult than HuniePop and HuniePop2 with no wonderful graphic reward. But it is good as burning time game you just click click click click click

Wonderful Scene

Do not have at all.

Quality of life 

Do not have at all. Why I do not count the skip tutorial. I will count it if it is in an option. And Kyu she pop out to talk couple line each time we start new game. Why is that?

I can not recommend this because of it is not F.ping material at all. | I 100% the game with all the wardrobe accesories you can get and I have to say that regardless of the erotic theme, this is a brilliant game so I heavily recommend trying this out if you are into tycoon/management games and usually are not keen on erotic games. This would work with every other theme as well and is definitely worth your time.

 | Stereotypical as it sounds, I really do play it for the game play. If you're big into clicker financial games, I really recommend Huniecam. I've had this game since 2016, and still regularly revisit it. Tight time frame helps keep the stress of making money just enough to keep me engaged in focus, music is good, and the art style is cute."
76561198192893105,268500,XCOM® 2,57.8,Strategy,28,"amazing tactical gameplay and challenge. XCOM 2 and WOTC are so different it is like 2 different games which makes replayability even higher. One of my favorite games. I would give 10/10 | After my 3rd attempt, I was able to beat this game, and I didn't really like it. The game is cruel, unreasonably hard and very disrespectful to player. 
At first, the game bombards you with a ton of non-skippable events, missions, messages. While you trying to figure out what's going on, they put on a timer on you with this ""Project Avatar"" thing, and you immediately feel a lot of pressure. Some missions are just crazy difficult, like those for Serpent King and Mad AI factory, and you don't expect this difficulty this early in the game.
Mid-game you finally have a chance to catch some breath and start working on some research, building and engineering, but here's the catch: the moment you get better in the game, the moment you upgrade your weapons and armour, the enemies suddenly become more powerful and armoured. You just don't have a chance to enjoy powerful things that you've made, because they quickly become just what is expected by default.
The end game comes unexpectedly, with a lot of pressure on you. It consists of two consecutive missions with no pause in between. If you got some units damaged in the first mission, you either will have to replace your best units or send them in wounded. The final mission is crazy, the amount of extremely powerful enemies is over the top, and it carries a lot of stress.
Given that the game is flawed with bugs in controls, has dumb battle mechanics that lead to absurd situations and very challenging overall even on lower difficulties, I would not recommend this game. | Le jeu en lui même est ok, War of the Chosen ajoute énormément au gameplay et est un incontournable pour XCOM 2. je vous recommande aussi d'utiliser des mods.

 | XCOM2の面白さを語るには、前作にして名作 XCOM: Enemy Unknown (以下XCOM:EU) と比較すると分かりやすいと思う

まず前作のXCOM:EUからあらゆる面で順当に進化しておりボリュームも増した
Steamワークショップ対応でMODも充実と欠点なし！と、損は無いのでセール時にはぜひ買ってプレイしてほしい

以上を大前提とした上で、そう⋯700時間以上もプレイ（最高難易度を最小部隊人数でクリア済）した上で私個人の見解を言わせてもらうと
XCOM:EUよりもゲーム性（ゲームとしての楽しさの意）は落ちてしまったと感じる
XCOM:EUはXCOM2よりも飽きの来る要素が多いはずなのに⋯だ！
※EUでは敵の配置が一部完全固定だったり⋯etc

繰り返し遊ぶゲームとしてみるとXCOM2の方が優秀なはずである
ではなぜ私はXCOM:EUの方がゲーム性が高いと言えるのか？
XCOM:EUのゲーム性はまるでパワプロなのだ
パワプロもメインイベントは決まった日に起こるはずなのに、何度もプレイしても楽しい

XCOM:EUではストーリーの進行と、ミッションが適切な間隔で詰まっており
兵士の計画的な育成（＝ビルドを組む楽しさ）と、時間制限（＝敵の更新／強化）
のバランスがすごい良かったのだ
そしてランダム性が少ないことが→上手くなれば、あらゆる要素を縛っても戦術で勝てる
など良い方向に働いたりした

一方でXCOM2では、多くの追加要素により楽しさも増したが、
その分ストーリーとミッションの関連性が薄れ、またタイムリミット枠の選ばれし者たちの介入は、
戦闘を長引かせる良くない要素の一つだと思う
選ばれし者自体はすごく面白いのだが、3人は多い！ゲームのかさ増しになってしまってる

ストーリーとレジスタンスの尻拭いを交互にやらされるのも間延びする原因だ
XCOM:EUでは助ける国と、見捨てる国の切り分けも緊張感を煽る良いスパイスだった
XCOM:EUでの上手くなるは「ゲームオーバーにならなければ見捨てて/切り捨ててOK」だった
XCOM2では上手くなると「滅亡カウンターがやばくなってきたから、そろそろ助けに行くか～」と、どの難易度でもなった
侵略されてXCOM:EUより悲惨なはずなのに、なんか緊張感にかけるのである
追加要素をプレイさせるために、滅亡までの時間にどうしても猶予が出来てしまったためだ
この点がゲーム性がXCOM:EUより落ちてしまったと感じる部分だ

難易度が上がると、どんどん無駄を減らすプレイングが重要で、駆け抜けるようなゲームプレイ感になるXCOM:EUと
研究や勢力や選ばれし者など、たくさんの要素からどっしり構えて戦略を練っていくXCOM2とプレイ感が違う
そしてたまたまXCOM:EUの方が私に合っていただけなのかも知れない

色々言ったがXCOM2のMODでの拡張性と、それに伴う豊富なキャラクリは本当に最高なので
みんなもお気に入りのキャラを作ってプレイしよう！

76561198192893105,427820,Hitman GO: Definitive Edition,1.4166666666666667,Strategy,4,"В свое время я пропустил данную игру, так как не любил стелс игры (это же Hitman подумал я), да и доверия к мобильному геймингу в 2014 было не очень много (первоначально игра вышла на iOS).

И данная неприятная ассоциация как то засела у меня в голове, без обновления информации, вплоть до 2024 года, когда на очередной распродаже мне удалось выхватить эту игру почти даром.

И на этот раз мое мнение изменилось. Игра представляет из себя имитацию настольной пошаговой игры, в которой нам надо достичь целей уровня. Каждый наш шаг будет активировать действия противников, которые мы заранее можем предугадать. Играется это как вариация “Камисадо” (ну у меня была такая внутренняя ассоциация).

В игре есть 7 целей, которые микшируются в зависимости от уровня.
[olist]
    [*]Дойти до точки эвакуации
    [*]Убить главную цель
    [*]Захватить кейс с данными
    [*]Убить всех на уровне
    [*]Никого не убивать на уровне
    [*]Сделать не более N шагов
    [*]Не убивать собак
[/olist]

Причем, 1 и 2 цель всегда завершают уровень и не могут быть на одном уровне одновременно.

Также в игре есть 3 типа врагов (охранник, бегун, снайпер). На самом деле их больше, но они очень схожи по своим паттернам. 

По итогу комбинация целей, врагов и маршрутов дают нам головоломку для решения уровня. К сожалению, иногда последовательность решения может существовать только одна, что для головоломки - не очень хороший показатель.

Игра вываливает на тебя чуть больше сотни уровней, которые прячутся за 8 коробками (этапами), где каждый этап дает новые механики.

Игра идеальна для Steam Deck, я играл в нее перед сном по 30 минут, за это время можно смело пройти 1 этап. И пусть вас не смущает отсутствие английского языка, тут из английского слов 30 на всю игру))))

Так же, не могу не отметить относительную легкость достижений. Поскольку игра пошаговая, сложных достижений нет (если гуглить). Но есть неинтересные - это фарм убийств, прохождение всех уровней на 3 звезды и нельзя использовать подсказки, иначе запорите достижение и придется начинать все заново.

По итогу, как игру для дека могу рекомендовать, проходится за пару вечеров, выглядит атмосферно и играется неплохо.

P.S. Если вы как я, решили что есть настольная игра (по мотивам которой и сделали Hitman GO), то увы это не так, просто игра сделана как настолка. И на моей памяти это впервые, обычно настолки переносят в цифру, а тут сделали настолку в цифре без настолки. 
 | It is a fine game, but has a few major flaws; the first being broken achievements. In my 7 hours of
playtime, I could only get 6 achievements, and the rest simply refused to unlock. This makes hundred
percenting the game irrelevant.
My other complaint comes from how the objective system works. Hundred percenting a level requires
you to do two optional objectives. The problem is that the level design only allows you to complete one
at a time, forcing you to play the same level twice, only in a slightly different manner. This made the
game infinitely more boring for me, so much so that I stopped perfecting it altogether, making my
experience much more enjoyable. Incentivising replayability can work for a mainline Hitman game,
where tonnes of content is available to explore, keeping each replay fresh and interesting. But, forcing
players to replay levels from a board game which is already so linear, was a step in the wrong direction.
I think the worst type of objectives were ""complete the game in x turn or less"". They turned the
experience into a slog. In addition to this, the game does not even show how many turn you have made
in a level, making these challenges even more annoying. Providing this information would have turned
them much more tolerable.
The missions where you could complete all the objectives in one go were actually fun, and the entire
game should have been like this. Coincidentally, these levels also did not contain that aforementioned
""x turns or less"" challenge. Another minor criticism I have is that you have to manually check the
objectives in a level by going to the menu. I would have preferred if they were directly displayed on the
screen, or at the beginning of each level.
I know that the I sound extremely negative in my review. But, most of my problems are only relevant if
you are looking forward to hundred percenting the game. If you do not care about that, it just ""clicks"",
especially its sound effects. They add so much to the experience, and it would have been a somewhat of
an inferior product if not for them. Every action is punctuated with so much weight, that you can
almost forget for a moment that you are not actually killing people. The music too, while used
sparingly, fits the tone of the experience. | Bueno, complejo, menos de 10h de gameplay, lamentablemente no tiene un buen soundtrack y carece de sonidos, en pocas palabras, es como jugar ajedrez con skins. | Não procure as respostas no google.

Seu design é praticamente perfeito, e ele frequentemente oferece aos jogadores alguns dos momentos de descoberta e admiração mais gratificantes que terão em qualquer jogo - isso se o jogador estiver disposto a aceitar o seu desafio e se esforçar para chegar neles. Esse não é um jogo para todos: ele é quase completamente desprovido de narrativa, diálogo ou até mesmo de trilha sonora, não possui tutoriais escritos explícitos e é focado exclusivamente em sua mecânica principal de resolver quebra-cabeças de ""labirinto"". Mas para o público específico que ele agrada, essa é uma experiência imperdível.

A ilha de The Witness é um mundo aberto enorme completamente recheado de puzzles, com o jogo possuindo mais de 500 telas para serem resolvidas. Enquanto isso pode parecer entediante, na minha experiência (surpreendentemente) não podia ser mais longe da verdade: a ilha possui 11 áreas principais distintas, cada uma com suas ""mecânicas"" e regras próprias que devem ser aprendidas para prosseguir, e esse conhecimento adquirido vai te ajudar a passar por lugares específicos em outras partes da ilha. A forma que você vai descobrindo como essas mecânicas funcionam e como o jogo encontra diferentes maneiras de relacionar os puzzles uns com os outros e com o mundo ao seu redor nunca deixa de impressionar. Sua progressão é baseada em conhecimento adquirido, então jogar sabendo o mínimo possível é essencial.

Esse jogo tem várias reputações diferentes, e eu queria endereçar algumas das negativas. Uma delas é a de que ele é um jogo impossivelmente difícil, ou que possui puzzles que exigem coisas absurdas do jogador - eu mesmo estava receoso há anos de começar o jogo por receio disso. Por sorte, posso dizer que terminar The Witness não é nada impossível, inclusive nem é necessário terminar todas as áreas e resolver todos os quebra-cabeças para chegar em sua conclusão. É uma experiência que exige atenção e esforço do jogador, mas que é longe de ser impossível. Agora, se você quiser fazer 100% dele, aí sim existem alguns pontos nos quais talvez seja necessário ir atrás de pistas ou de um guia, mas eu altamente recomendo tentar fazer o máximo possível dele sem ajuda externa, realmente vale a pena.

Sua segunda reputação negativa, um pouco mais difícil de argumentar, é a de que ele é um projeto pretensioso, sendo que essa é uma crítica altamente subjetiva. Essa visão vem do fato do jogo ser repleto de audiologs com citações de diferentes cientistas, filósofos e poetas sobre assuntos como arte, religião e a procura de significado, porém acho importante ressaltar que todo esse aspecto do jogo é quase completamente opcional, você consegue terminar ele sem nunca escutar um audiolog sequer. Eu escutei todos por querer encontrar tudo que o jogo tinha a oferecer e, apesar de pessoalmente não ter me conectado muito com essa parte do jogo, ainda assim teve alguns trechos que me comoveram. Eu não acho que é errado o jogo ter essa ambição artística e se ver e se portar como um projeto de arte, e eu acho que é uma adição que se casa muito bem com o resto da experiência: os quebra-cabeças e a ilha como um todo são sobre expandir sua perspectiva e ver significado onde antes não havia, e essas diferentes perspectivas sobre assuntos que os audiologs conferem são apenas uma outra extensão disso.

De fato, eu tive muitos poucos problemas com o jogo, o maior deles sendo que existem aspectos envolvendo som e cores que podem dificultar pessoas com problemas de audição ou com algum grau de daltonismo de terminarem o jogo sem o uso de um guia - eu mesmo tive que ir atrás de ajuda em uma determinada parte por conta disso. Eu também cheguei num ponto que achei que a ilha tinha conteúdo demais e desejei que o jogo acabasse mais cedo, mas em retrospectiva isso foi uma falha minha em querer terminar o jogo o mais rápido possível, essa é uma experiência mais contemplativa e feita pra ser jogada ao longo de um período maior de tempo.

Eu recomendo muito The Witness para qualquer um que se interessou pelo que eu descrevi aqui, ou que é fã de aspectos mais filosóficos e artísticos em jogos, e considero uma experiência obrigatória para qualquer fã de jogos de puzzle - podem jogar sem medo que realmente vale muito a pena. | The Witness is a puzzle and exploration game that gives no clear direction or instructions. It requires you to sit with a lot of puzzles and simply take the time to view things from alternate perspectives as you stare into reflections, listen, look at things in different lighting and angles, and try to create new ways of paying witness to the world around you. Ultimately, I think games like this make me realize that I'm not as into puzzle games that aren't directly connected to a tangible story as I thought. The secret ending gives another level of depth, forcing you to see those puzzle patterns experienced in the game, in every part of the environment of the game even where you might not have expected them to be or even externally even in real life. It's a gorgeous way of creating madness as you analyze the world around you a little more through fresh eyes. 5/10 | 就是看你能不能对上作者的脑回路，没有地图，没有传送，迷路了要么就是从头再来，要么就是从中间跳了不知道多少关，接着深深地陷入哲学三问中，最后用一句饱含感情的脏话结束这段难忘的冒险
作者一门心思让我猜他那些无聊的想法，而我的回答是：不，我完全没兴趣知道你的脑袋瓜是怎么构成的 | 极其硬核的解谜类游戏，在一笔画的基础上用众多图形与机制打造了数百个谜题，它们都无比精妙绝伦，但无一例外上手很难
而且它的引导性很差，甚至是差到极点，比如我吧，刚出樱花树林就走到了小镇，而谜题难度相当于刚刚读一年级就去考中考
但是，极差的引导性换来的是无比的沉浸感，在这个小岛上只有你一个人和这些精巧的谜题，就像孤身一人在半夜的卢浮宫徘徊，细致地端详每一件艺术品
或许有时有些谜题很难，无法一下解决，导致卡住了流程，那你也可以放一放，去看看别的谜题，可能看着看着就想出来了；你也可以先放下它，回到生活中来，等你重拾信心再去打开它，毕竟，卢浮宫的艺术品对我们而言并不比家里的柴米油盐更有价值
总之，若是抛开引导性和上手难度不谈，它是绝对的艺术品；当然，说话要全面，不过在我这里，它瑕不掩瑜，我仍然为它颠倒（仅个人观点）

Here's the breakdown of who should dive into Harran and who might want to look elsewhere if you're still on the fence:

[b]Who should play Dying Light:[/b]
[list]
[*]Parkour enthusiasts: If you love the idea of fluid movement and mastering a challenging traversal system, Dying Light's parkour is a major selling point. It's not just a gimmick, it's core to the gameplay and incredibly satisfying to pull off.[*]Zombie fans with a taste for tension: The day/night cycle is a game-changer. If you enjoy the feeling of dread creeping in as the sun sets and the infected become more aggressive, Dying Light delivers that in spades.
[*]Players who like a mix of action and survival: It's not pure survival horror, and it's not just mindless action. Dying Light finds a good balance between scavenging, crafting, combat, and tense escapes.
[*]Those who enjoy open-world exploration: Harran is a big place with lots to discover. If you like exploring and finding hidden secrets, you'll have plenty to do.
[*]Co-op players: Zombie slaying with friends is always a good time, and Dying Light's co-op mode is exceptional between the campaign, challenges, and more. 
[/list]
[b]Who might want to pass on Dying Light:[/b]
[list]
[*]Players who prefer realistic zombie simulations: If you're looking for a game where zombies are slow and easy to dispatch, Dying Light's fast and aggressive infected might not be your cup of tea.
[*]Those who dislike repetition: Mastering the parkour and surviving the night often requires repeating sections. If you get easily frustrated by this, it could be a turn-off.
[*]Players who prioritize story above all else: While the story is decent, it's not the main focus. If you need a strong narrative to stay engaged, you might find it lacking.
[*]Those who are easily scared: The nighttime sequences can be genuinely terrifying. If you're not a fan of jump scares and intense situations, you might find it a bit too much.
[/list]

☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs | I've only played a few turn-based strategy games, but after finishing the Age of Fear trilogy I intend to play a lot more – including any future Age of Fear games that should emerge. The tabletop-style maps are not fundamentally all that different from the grid-based battlefields of Fire Emblem and XCOM, but I personally got a warm fuzzy sensation from painstakingly positioning my troops where I thought they would be most effective – plus, the lack of a clearly-defined grid makes human error a more distinct possibility, as there were times when an enemy was able to charge through a gap in my formation that I'd thought I'd sealed up. The fact that most movement can only be conducted in a straight line also forces the player to plan ahead, lest reinforcements end up trapped behind the allies they are trying to save – something which gives added value to units with the segmented move skill, who can dodge around front-ranks troops to engage the mages and archers who usually hide near the rear.

Although most battles will eventually devolve into a massed melee at some point or other, the band of beer-swilling dwarves plays quite differently from the army uniting the disparate forces of nature. The Dwarves have tough infantry and ale that heals them at the expense of dulling their skills for a few turns, whilst the Forces of Nature have diverse options including cannon-fodder plants that can regrow if they are slain in battle, sturdy ents, mushroom-people archers, a drider whose quick attacks can be devastating if he is properly equipped, and a huge spiky bear. In the aftermath, the player is taken to a menu where they can recruit new troops, teach veterans new skills, equip or sell items that have been found or stolen in battle, and purchase other pieces of equipment. The capacity to customise your main heroes is quite extensive, and even your lowlier soldiers can carry a couple of potions, allowing for a wider range of tactical possibilities than even the previous two games provided.

The visuals are simple but effective; different units are easily recognisable, and although the animations are pretty basic they get the job done. The tabletop-gaming aesthetic serves a useful function, too: in, say, a Dwarf-versus-Dwarf battle, your troops will have different coloured bases from your enemies, so you can distinguish between them at a glance. Age of Fear might not be a treat for the eyes, but it's no eyesore either – I'd much rather have functional graphics that work reliably than a glitch-ridden mess, and I'm glad AoF has the former.

The two campaigns each took me around sixteen hours to complete, approximately twice as long as the average campaign in AoF1 or AoF2; the occasional plot-based decision, varying difficulties, hidden secrets and achievements all offer a player excuses for replaying them, if you're that way inclined. The Dwarf campaign wasn't much to write home about, consisting mostly of short angry people being rude to other people and then fighting them (the story of my life…), but the tale of the Dryad and the Drider had more of a narrative arc to it, plus a trio of heroes whose bantering made up for the fact that many of their troops were literally vegetables.

OVERALL
If pressed, I would confess that this was my least favourite of the Age of Fear games. Maybe this is the result of me playing all three games back-to-back in the span of a few months, giving me a case of Turn-Based Tactical Fatigue; maybe it was because AoF3 was undergoing a transitional period in the weeks I played it, as the developers grafted open-world elements onto the campaign in a fashion that gave the game a work-in-progress feel to it – but there was a certain je ne sais quoi about playing the two campaigns in this game that left me a little less enamoured than my experience of the previous games. Nevertheless, I did play them, and I did like them. The core gameplay remains the same, so it's unlikely to win over anyone who disliked the previous games, but the ambition and dedication on display by the developers – introducing new characters and factions with each game, and releasing free patches and upgrades at what seems to be a rate of more than once a week – should be applauded, especially in these times when the monetization of video-games is a much-debated issue. All in all, the AoF blend of turn-based tactics and role-play gaming mechanics has produced another good game, and I look forwards to seeing where the series goes next. | I feel bad not recommending this game. It's not careless or disrespectful of the audience. There's a lot of value with 2 branching campaigns. Unit variety is nice, upgrade options for units (who stay with you mission to mission) is varied and interesting. The story itself is not well written but it is original as are the characters.

It's an indie game with basic production value, no animation and fairly bad art. But that's not why I'm not recommending it, I've played long enough to not care, especially for a turn based strategy game.

The reason I'm not recommending it is because the turn based strategy part is awfully shallow. I'm used to certain basic things - zones of control, modifiers for range and cover, line of sight, fog of war, penalties for being surrounded, etc. etc. This has none of them. On top of that units move slowly and just can't get around each other (and can't move again after moving even a tiny bit). During most fights you'll just shuffle your back units around ineffectually, trying to move them past other units with massive bases that you can't get through.

Maybe some people would like the design decisions that went behind this game. You can read the  [url=https://oldgrizzledgamers.com/reviews/age-fear-3-legend-review-53/]full review[/url] just in case. I did not enjoy the game and found it to be a long, boring slog. | Я давний поклонник серии Age of Fear. В ней есть всё, что мне нравится - интересные тактические бои, удобное управление в один клик мышкой, хитрый искусственный интеллект, приятная 2Д- графика. А еще присутствует около 200 различных юнитов, тонны артефактов и зелий, а теперь еще и карта мира. Если вам нравятся пошаговые тактические игры - смело берите. Автор игры внимательно прислушивается к мнениям игроков и постоянно что-то улучшает (даже спустя несколько лет после релиза он что-то добавляет в Age of Fear-1). Настоятельно рекомендую к покупке! | I bought this game during a sale and sat on it for way longer than I should have. What can I say, the graphics and presentation sort of put it the ""I'll get to it when I get to it"" pile. Well, I finally got to it and I had a great time! 🏆 And funnily enough, the game has only gotten better with age. 👨‍🍳🤏

That's because the excellent developers ""backport"" innovations from others in the series to their games, so you get to enjoy the latest and greatest when you play. They really are great -- and response and friendly on the forums, too. 🤗

Anyone who likes turn-based army games (FF tactics, Age of Wonders, Ogre Battle, etc.) will enjoy Age of Fear. You get to run an army, upgrade your troops, try lots of different units and tactics, and have a guided campaign (or two) to keep you going. The design is generous with options and allows for a wide range of difficulties. Pick it up, support good devs, and have some fun... and no need to rush, the game will be great whenever you get around to it. 👴💯"

●良い点
・ゲームの雰囲気が良い

●悪い点
・ゲーム内での説明がほとんどなく、特にやり始めだとゲームが進行しているかどうかがわかりにくい(せめて1-2とか3-1とかそういう表記が欲しかった)
・ゲームの仕様上特定の装備が強く(というよりむしろ必須級)、更にゲーム開始時に解禁した装備から選ぶことができるため、状況にあわせて装備を変えるといったローグライク的楽しみがかなり薄い
・上記の理由により、敵を連続で倒すことでお金を得られるというメリットがあまりない
・1面後半(2面前半？)では消える足場を乗り継いで右に行く構成となっているが、下に行くと普通に道があるため、敵にほとんど関与せず素通りすることができるため、あまり意味を成していない(上で言及したようにお金を得られるメリットがあまりないことを考えると猶更)
・自動生成という都合上仕方なくはあるが、ステージ生成がたまにかなり理不尽なことがある
・被弾した時の無敵時間が短く、また足場に着地しないと復帰できないため、それが原因ではめ殺しされるとかなりストレスが溜まる

ゲーム自体がつまらないというわけではないためおすすめにするかどうか非常に迷いましたが、""おすすめしない""とさせていただきます。
 | Sadly but it's a ""no"" for me.

I tried the game for a few minutes long ago. Apparently as i'm looking things up to write this, it was before the blueberry edition so idk how much it impacts my experience now and how much different the game was before. I don't remember much from the first time i booted up the game but i decided to give it a go again because... hell, my backlog is yelling at me from the background. So I can only speak of what i experienced as of playing today and i feel like it's enough for me. I don't feel like trying more.

So at first it's actually decent because it's a fresh experience after all. You're trying to figure out enemies, weapons and not (so just like in any game, i know) so dying will be a skill issue too. and i'm fine with that. Learning process, sure, I'm here for it if there's anything to learn. I really don't mind dying a lot as long as i feel like i can progress. I don't feel it about that game, sadly. But the more i played the more issues i had with the game itself.
Some hitboxes are questionable at times causing me to lose head when i don't think i should be (and sometimes things work just fine, the other time i do get hit).
Running out of ammo is rough especially when there's no aim ability.
Losing head will always be the death of me no matter what and I don't feel like I'm dying because of skill issue. And that feels really bad.
Oh and more often than not, enemies are right on top of my stuff (also plenty of my things end up usually being thrown into different highs (and sometimes you won't even see that) so good luck picking things up without dying too).
Sometimes visibility of the character is not quite there. it happened a few times that i had no idea where i am when enemies surrounded me and i was dying because of that too.
Some layouts/narrow corridors (especially going up) with specific mobs that will definitely hit me are annoying to navigate through without dying. Density more often than not with the combination of it is painful because you will most likely get hit.
Most enemies that i encountered are interesting. Some are annoying tho but as long as they're not packed with too high density, they are easily manageable. there's one type that i hated so far but it might be because of where i encounter them.

all in all, I had fun at first but as i tried to progress more... i got more annoyance from the game. i like the idea of it. I like that we can do combos but more often than not, issues above won't even allow for incredible combos. at least that's my experience and it doesn't seem fun at all. it's a shame because the game seems cool. i kinda feel like the pace of the game is supposed to be fast to get combos but at the same time playing fast doesn't seem like a reasonable option with low ammo management, all the possible hits and layouts that can force you to just kite enemies around one by one. seems... counter-intuitive? unless i got the wrong idea of the game.

btw music is great and i like the artstyle a lot.

76561198192893105,440650,Niche - a genetics survival game,0.35,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",1,"Would recommend if you got it on sale. It is very much a 'create your own fun' sort of game, rather than having definite goal. However, it feels more like a well polished demo than a full release, and seems to completely overestimate its depth (particularly in Story Mode). The genetics system is quite basic, and you can see every gene your creatures have (unless you're in sandbox and disable it). Mutations are based solely on player input rather than occurring naturally. For a game in which the physical traits of the creatures is the main focus, the creature models are quite underwhelming, even considering the graphical style of the game. If this game had mod support or still received updates I think it would be much easier to recommend it at full price, but it has neither of those things.

Story Mode
Story mode is intended to be a sort of tutorial for new players. The (unskippable) tutorial does a good job of explaining the game, but really didn't need a whole game mode for it. This game mode has several genetic mutations unique to it (I *think* you can get the same genes in sandbox, just not as mutations). Which is a bit of an issue if you want to complete everything in a sandbox world. There are two main goals: get home, and keep a certain gene in your creatures the whole while. The game does not explain how to get home, and it does not point out the unique gene or its significance. I believe the intended way to play is to move to each new island, completely conquer it while adapting your creatures to it, and then move on to do the same to the next island (which you've probably chosen at random). If you choose to play that way, even if you know the fastest path home, don't die and restart, don't lose the special gene and restart - you're going to be spending many hours playing this way. Far too many for what this game has to offer. And you *are* going to die, and you *are* going to lose the gene, potentially *many* hours in to a run. And once you 'win', you get to keep doing what you've been doing this entire time, minus the stress of the special gene. There is also zero customization to this game mode's settings unless you want to use console commands.

Sandbox Mode
Sandbox Mode really illustrates the lack of features and depth of the features the game does have. You can customize what type of island you start on, the genes of your starting creatures, their lifespans, and the resources/animals that spawn. Most of these are an on/off switch, or a slider with a too limited range. A win condition can be set, but your options are very limited. Despite being the 'main' game mode, you are unable to get several mutations (locked behind story mode). Meaning you need to find outsider creatures that have those genes (if that is possible, I'm not sure), and invite them to your tribe. If you wanted to 100% the mutations menu, you're going to have to play Story Mode. I mentioned above that this is a 'make your own fun' game, but Sandbox really doesn't give you the options to make your world just as you want it.

Applying to both of the gamemodes 
It just gets repetitive and boring. Pick food, cut grass, breed, maybe move to another island that may or may not be mostly indistinguishable, die, repeat. And very little other than the breeding is interesting. Even that is shallow - choose two creatures with the traits you want, and if you don't want the baby, drown it. The genetics and mutation menus look a lot more complicated that they really are. As for food: gathering from anything is about the same. It's all about what your creature can gather, not its diet. Hunting is time-consuming and just not worth it unless you have extra creatures with good attack. Predators are dangerous, but you can just run away (or hide, if you clicked the appropriate colors and patterns in the mutation menu and got it to pass down). Moving to another island is risky, and often leads to undesirable creatures staying by berry bushing and harvesting them while everyone else travels. This gets old very quickly. The islands are also pretty bland. Other than a few different creatures and plants, they're mostly the same. Sometimes almost identical. 

Another review said this as well, but: Look at the screenshots. That's what you're playing. That's not a part of the game, that's pretty much all of it. What you see is what you get.

Despite all I've said above, I had some fun with it. I might go back to it in the future, but I doubt my thoughts will change on it. The creatures are interesting and cute, and while the gameplay isn't too complex, it can be punishing if you are unaware of the dangers, take too many risks, or are just unprepared. I haven't run into any bugs, and the game runs smoothly. Once you've figured out the interface, it's quite easy to use. Just get it on sale if you can wait. | Jogo ótimo para passar o tempo.

76561198192893105,443810,This Is the Police,4.4,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy",1,"This is genuinely one of my favourite management games because it requires you to be a bit strategic with your mangement of the officers at your disposal. 

Anyhow. You are Jack Boyd, Freeburg's police chief and City hall plans to remove you at the end of tenure as the mayor plans to put his son in charge. You have a 100 days to get a retirement fund and bounce. How will you make it happen? 

It falls short on a few things such as it being a very very long game that could take up to 20 hours if not more but its filled with many suprising quests and other choices that do matter to the story. 


7/10, Would play again if i had so much patience and time. | I liked a lot of what This Is The Police does, but it's really hindered by some quite upsetting aspects that end up completely breaking immersion, making it boring and sometimes frustrating.

In short, it's a game where you play the police chief in the fictional city of Freeburg in 1985, and your job is to hire officers and detective, assign them to cases, and try to navigate the politics of being a police chief in a corrupt city. It's a cool idea and it really gripped me in the beginning.

But the first problematic point, for me, was - the game forces you to be corrupt. It's doesn't ""make it really hard"" to play without going bad, like for example Papers Please does. It literally forces you.
Very early in the game, I got an offer from the Mafia to basically start working for them. I declined. Two days later, I was informed - they didn't accept my negative answer, I'm working for them anyway. Started getting requests from them, and I just ignored those because - again - I didn't wanna be corrupt. A few more days later, the story informed me in a cutscene that I have been assassinated. The end.

Well, sh!t, why even pretend to give me a choice in this if it just means I die?

Fine, whatever. I restarted. My playthrough wasn't going that well anyway - I was being too nice and it resulted in officers and civilians being killed. Turns out, the best approach in every case is to be aggressive as hell. Got a hostage situation? Don't negotiate, that'll let him escape and get your officers killed. Just send SWAT in and shoot him in the head. It seems the best approach 100% of the time is to go for the kill, and once I realized that, my 2nd playthrough literally had a success rate of 100%.

Things were going great this time. I accepted that the game wants me to be corrupt, and I just fully embraced it this time. Did everything the mob asked. Perfectly handled every call that wasn't mob related, solved every detective case, the mayor was happy with me and so all my requests for upgrades were accepted. Everything was going great.
I reached day 30 almost bored, because everything was going so smoothly I didn't even need to think anymore. I started watching youtube videos on my 2nd monitor while playing, because the game alone just wasn't interesting enough, but I did want to continue the story. 
Then day 31 came, and there's a time jump. Not gonna spoil why, but the story jumps forward a couple of weeks. And when I got back... things were suddenly really bad. All of my officers were exhausted, overworked and unhappy. Some had 0 energy bars left. I had to have SOMEONE in the shift so I ordered some to stay and work, but that wasn't enough to deal with all the crimes that popped up, and suddenly I had to fail handling some calls, civilians die, the mayor was mad, and... worst of all, my best detective died in a car accident, fell asleep at the wheel because he was overworked.
What the f*ck. I get that the game needed to up the difficulty a bit because things were going too smoothly to be interesting, but taking me out only to f*ck up my squad and then bring me back to pick up the pieces? That's such a lousy way to do it. That's like saying ""well if you don't make mistakes, we will make mistakes for you"". Why do I even bother then?

Whatever. I was upset but the story was interesting enough I kept playing, and soon enough I had things under control again, and that's when things started getting interesting. I had a serial killer on the loose, which presented new challenges, plus I got a real opportunity to take out the mafia. A way out of corruption, I figured.

So I start working on both of these things, mainly focused on the mafia thing. Working up the ladder, arresting people and turning them against their superior, climbing and climbing on a mountain of evidence to reach the top.
Then, like 30 days later, I finally get the evidence I need to reach to top guy, and... oh, can't arrest him now. We got the final piece of evidence kinda late in the day and the lead detective on the case needs to go home. His shift ended, you see. And you can't make the arrest without him (well, you can, but you risk a significantly lower chance of success). 
Again, what kind of bullsh*t is this? This is the biggest bust of his career. This is taking down the mafia. This would make him a city hero, it's an arrest any detective dreams of, and... he's fine with putting it off until the day after tomorrow, because his shift just ended? What??
I was just so confused by this, that I actually forgot I have the option to order him to work tomorrow, meaning I'd only have to wait 1 night and not 2. So I waited another 2 days, and... by the morning of the 2nd - I get informed: I was too late to the arrest, the suspect got away.
Weeks of work, all down the drain because my lead detective couldn't work a bit of overtime to get the biggest bust of his life.

Add to that the annoyance during these couple of weeks where we literally have a serial killer on the loose, I need all hands on deck, and every day I got a few officers coming in saying sh!t like ""Hey I was reading a book last night and I really wanna finish it, can I get the day off?"" - No, of course you can't, there's a SERIAL KILLER terrorising the city. What is wrong with you?  

It was just too much. I get it, the story wants to hammer in the idea that everybody is corrupt in this city, the good guys don't always win, etc etc. Fine. But it feels like it uses dirty tricks to make these points, and with the game being this long (I got to day 80-something in 8 hours, and the game is supposed to be 180 days long, so I assume it would have taken around 18-20 hours to finish), and it's just too much. I can't take 10 more hours of this. 
If the entire playthrough was 8 hours long, that would have been fine. It was mostly enjoyable for that long. But realizing I'm not even halfway through and I have to endure so much more of this was... too much. I can't do it. | A fun little game. The main character and the storyline are compelling enough to keep me hooked for the entirety of the game. The game mechanics are fundamentally very simple. Initially, I believed there was an underlying complexity to the decisions and the management of the policemen, but this was not the case, or perhaps I missed it somehow. Ultimatelly, this did not detract from my experience, as the story was the primary driving force for me. I just wanted to know how it ends for Jack. 
What I didn't like, is that the game was unnecessarily long, and the management aspect didn't feel too challenging. Contrary to some online opinions/reviews that say the game can be really unfair, I myself did not felt that. However, I can understand how certain events might create an impression of unfairness. I was likely just fortunate that these events did not significantly impact my gameplay, leading me to conclude that the game was considerably easier than I expected.
At the end I really enjoyed my time with This is the Police and I would like to see if something changes with different decisions in another playthrough, but I won't. It just drags for too long, which might not be an issue if the much of that time wouldn't be just waiting.
So, my advice is play it, enjoy it, be glad that you did and move on. | Я придбав цю гру з двох причин: перша – сподобався візуальний стиль гри, а друга причина – це тому, що я і сам є поліцейським.

All the actions of the police are not logical. The whole game is made so that the player experiences difficulties, and there is no choice of difficulty mode here. I regret the time spent on this game, I do not recommend anyone to play this game. My rating is 1/10. | After 10 hours of marginally interesting story I got a game over screen and I don't know why.

you asked earlier in your discord how to get zaccaria to a broader audience and its by working harder and actually listening to criticism, you tried with postal, and it was pretty good.

you should have hired real artists, you should have opened up to your community more about the difficulties of your work, i bet some people who love this game would actually love to contribute. too late now.

76561198192893105,448910,Axes and Acres,18.966666666666665,"Indie, Strategy",12,"Absolutely fantastic game if you are a fan of building games (Civ etc.) and the elegance of chess. You build a little town, making your build choices differently based on variations in the layout of the terrain and the victory point conditions that vary in each play-through. It is consistent enough to appeal to (former) chess player in me, but random enough to be exciting and new each time. Random cards and ""dice"" (types of ""people"" you can use each turn to take various actions) keep it exciting, forcing tactical adjustments every turn, but largely without upsetting your larger strategy.

It has its limits. Once you have really mastered it (I am 5th on the leaderboards) it is pretty much done. You cannot play it 20 totally different ways for 10 years like the best Civ-type games of all time. But the subtleties of tactics and strategy are absolutely fantastic to figure out along the way despite what look like incredibly simple mechanics. So it is an wonderful puzzle game wrapped in a tactical game that is wrapped in a builder game. While I am pretty much done with it, it will stay in my memory as one of the best games I have ever played.

 | Right now, Axes and Acres is half off for the Winter Sale, and I think that $4.99 is a fair price for what this is: a digital version of a typical European board-game.  It's not an American board-game, so it plays more like ""Settlers of Catan"" than ""Candyland.""  That means it's complicated at first, though it's very easy to learn if you watch TomChick's video of him playing it.  For what it is, it had the potential to be a great game: you build up your little hamlet from scratch each game, building houses, farms, guardhouses, town halls and so forth, and your peasants farm, chop trees, mine stone and reproduce, a game mechanic that requires two pawns instead of one for some inexplicable reason.  (Because your pawns aren't people, they are tiny dice-shaped figurines, so maybe they have one gender, or six.  I don't know.)

Anyway, the game is a lot of fun when you're playing it.  You only have so many dice each turn and only so much food, so you have to decide whether to build or farm and so forth.  Each game has random goals, such as ""Build 5 roads"" or ""Kill 3 barbarians"" and you have to work towards those goals in a set amount of turns.

And here is where the game goes from being great to being a near miss.  For some inexplicable reason, the game designers decided that foisting a super-complicated European-style digital board-game that has no real-world board game equivalent to it on an unsuspecting American teenage Steam populace would make these people go ""Oh, this is too complicated!  Make it harder!"" and so they decided that every time you win, the game would keep track, for every victory you would gain a Level, and the game would roughly subtract one turn for each victory.  So, if you are given 25 turns to win at Level 1, you only get 24 turns at Level 2, and 23 turns at Level 3.  

Now if you're great you may get to Level 50, if you're terrible you may get to Level 4, but at some point, every single person who plays will reach a maximum level where they can't go any higher, and so for them the game becomes an exercise in futility.   If you lose two games in a row, you lose a Level and gain back a turn, so you might rise to Level 50, lose 10 games and end up at Level 45.  I don't see this as a good thing, as you gain nothing.  

In various rogue-like and tower-defense games, you have a meta-game, where even if you lose terribly each game, you are still gaining gold, cards, skills or whatever, and so there is compensation for the game getting tougher.  ""Solar Settlers"" by the same company is a good example: you get cards permanently every time you play, and thus the entire game makes more sense and is always fun to play. 

So, I do recommend this game on sale.  It's worth playing for the 10 or 20 hours you'll get out of it before you find it frustrating and futile. | My favourite game of 2016.

Plays like a town building worker placement board game with some deck building on the side.

You are racing to meet your Victory Point target before you run out of turns. If you are successful you move on to the next phase where you keep all the infrastructure you have built, but the actions which give you Victory Points change. After you beat all three phases you win the map and increase one rank.

Each rank you go up increases the number of Victory Points required to beat the next map, however if you lose two maps in a row your rank decreases by one. This does a really good job of making sure things never get too hard or too easy for you. | Fun single player board game that gets slightly more difficult each time you win.

Elements of Worker Placement, Dice Rolling, Victory Point engine building, Light deckbuilding.

Would recommend for fans of Agricola, Empire, or even Civilisation. | These days it's extremely rare to see an original game design within the realm of video games. It's also hard to find elegant strategy games that are easy to learn and unfold their depth by the combination of relatively straight-forward rules. Axes and Acres delivers on both fronts!

The game resembles an economic solitaire board game, but uses the digital format to take full advantage of randomization (map, cards, goals, dice) to keep every playthrough fresh. All of the randomness happens before the player is making decisions though and can be mitigated in various ways, so it never feels unfair but more like a set of conditions you have to make the best out of every turn. 

On top of that, the game uses a ranking system to dynamically adjust the difficulty to the player's skill every match. It's a feature far too few single-player games use.

All in all this is, so far, probably the most interesting game I've played this year."

Want to fight Sentinels? No problem. Don't have time to fight them the next day? You can disable hostile creatures in the settings. Fights become too easy? You can turn all creatures to hostile and make it so you take more damage. You can turn on item destroy on death, item drop on death (only one grave though, so if you die twice items are gone - don't fall asleep like I did!), or you can not lose anything on death at all.

I recently finished the Aquarius redux in a night - starting off, I didn't want to waste time getting supplies for life support, shield strength, etc... so I just turned them off. Oh my goodness how much more enjoyable the expedition became because I could focus on just enjoying the journey! Currently doing The Cursed expedition and left my normal settings on, and it's been a blast. 

The fact that in 200+ hours I have yet to get bored, have yet to finish the story (because you can play any way you want... You can just jump around and explore / build like I have been with zero detriment!), and still enjoy all aspects of this game. I highly recommend this if you are a casual dad trying to live his best free-time low stress gaming life, and doubly so if you have a Steam Deck - *all* of my hours have been logged on my Deck without a single issue, and the Sleep function coupled with this game is an absolute win.

Sean if you read this... Thank you for so much, I wish this won Labor of Love: you guys absolutely earned it with how far you have come from the start ❤️ | Erro. Uma palavra simples, mas carregada de significado. Errar é falhar, é desviar do esperado, é frustrar expectativas. No Man’s Sky nasceu de um erro. Um erro de comunicação, de promessas feitas com paixão, mas sem a estrutura para cumpri-las. E, naquele momento, a Hello Games poderia ter feito o que muitas empresas fazem: seguir em frente, abandonar o jogo, e trair todos aqueles que acreditaram neles. Mas eles escolheram um caminho diferente.
Eles decidiram corrigir. Decidiram evoluir. Não apenas como empresa, mas como criadores, como artistas. O que começou como um jogo incompleto, tornou-se um dos maiores exemplos de redenção na indústria. Após cada atualização, cada linha de código, cada novo conteúdo adicionado, não foi apenas um ajuste técnico, foi uma declaração. Uma demonstração de respeito por aqueles que acreditaram no sonho.
O resultado? Um legado. No Man’s Sky, um jogo que não apenas melhorou. Ele se tornou um símbolo do que é possível quando se tem paixão, comprometimento e humildade. | 我在写这些文字的时候，已经玩了这款游戏20天，基本上我每天都会花费接近6个小时在这个游戏里。
这是我第一篇游戏评测，也是我玩的第一款关于太空主题的游戏，所以我会写的很啰嗦，很个人情绪化，算是给我自己当留念的。
我从小对“宇宙”，“未来”，“不确定性”都保有着强烈的憧憬和向往，人生清单之一就是拥有一台属于自己的天文望眼镜，亲眼见见浩瀚无垠的星空。
我不是真正的天文爱好者，只是这些美好的意象，给予了作为浪漫主义的那部分灵魂燃料，让我能对生活报以更多的热爱，我无数次幻想自己能躺在宇宙飞船里，透过玻璃窗望向星空，让思想飘荡在太空。
当我第一次接触到《无人深空》这个名字的时候，是偶然在b站看见了有关的视频，大概就是展现了遇见的很恐怖的星球。那个时候我并没有去了解《无人深空》到底是什么游戏，是什么玩法，是什么受众，我纯粹就是记住了这个名字，并且在某一次收到它打折的消息买下了它，随后就是放在库里吃灰。直到2024年的寒假，我打开了它。
就像我说的，我既不是真正的天文爱好者，也不是什么资深的游戏爱好者，我对《无人深空》没有报以什么期望，但是它确实满足了我的幻想，特别是前期的时候我登陆在各个星球进行探索的时候。当我完成前置任务成功驾驶飞船驶向太空的时候，从大气层到宇宙的转变，我真的很开心，很喜欢这个过场，同时从宇宙飞往具体的行星时，看着星球慢慢变大，山川陆地变得具体的时候，我都感到难以形容的满足，原谅我的少见多怪吧，我真的为这些感到惊喜，并且享受这种感觉。
关于剧情，我不太喜欢走剧情，乱逛是我的常态，在度过了前面的资源匮乏和不知所措的阶段后，我的日常就是，起床，处理居住点的破事，派遣船只，到处找地方卖掉一背包乱七八糟的货物（那个时候还没发现货船可以放储藏箱），偷窥空间站的飞船等级，打海盗，招揽人手，做点任务，以及解救货船的时候误伤了货船被恩将仇报。
天杀的我要和你们爆了，全给你炸了。还有修理损坏的护卫舰，我在这些奇怪的地方我代入感很强，虽然看起来很繁琐，很多重复的东西，但是我觉得很充实，很开心，就像我真的是一个货船的老大，到处奔波，忙忙碌碌。
对我来说有点遗憾的可能是换货船的时候，货船里的船员也会换掉吧，我还是很想船员们也和我一起，一直呆下去，虽然他们只是功能性外加装饰品的npc，但是我希望我的飞船上都是我熟悉的面孔，好吧，我是有点幼稚，会有”跟着我带你们做大做强，创造辉煌“的奇怪心理。说到装饰性npc，我特别喜欢 “莱拉普斯”这个小护卫，真的很喜欢，很可爱，非常可爱，在做这个任务的时候，我深怕它被刀掉了，好在之后它成为了我旅途中的伙伴wwww
尽管它只是一个npc，以及我很多次打护卫的时候看走眼一直朝着它开枪（）。以及它好吵，毕竟是机械，运行的时候响动挺大的，吵闹又沉默的可爱小东西。也算是因为对它的喜爱，我脑子一抽去查了相关“阿特拉斯”的东西，非常好，直接给自己剧透完了，这对吗这？
最近在忙着在货船基地搞基建，纯装修瘾发作了，不过能让我装修的东西确实太少了，货船的可建筑空间还是很大的，沉迷捣鼓布局和设计，设计动线和区域划分，也算是圆我小时候幻想自己能躺在宇宙飞船上看宇宙的梦了，虽，然，你，的，床，不，能，躺，真，的，很，让，我，伤，心。在装修好的房间，从窗口望去，看着那些我已经探索过的，或者没探索过的，感到好奇的，已经失去兴趣的，或相似或不同的星球，我久违的，找到了属于曾经的安宁与曾经渴望的满足。
我爱遥不可及的宇宙，就如我爱着生命的诞生与泯灭，奇迹无时无刻在宇宙诞生，无时无刻在宇宙消亡，我无法去记录，去见证，去猜测。我只是宇宙中微不可见的粒子，尽管仰头，目光所及之处皆为过去，所见之物皆为历史，人类对宇宙的幻想是一首具有延迟性的情诗，尽管身躯将我们束缚在这颗孕育了这颗美丽的乐土星球，让时间作为帮凶。好在想象力永远能带领人类跨过这些枷锁，走向更远大更深邃，更瑰丽绚烂的无限可能，抵达群星之处。
所以我接下来还会跑去其他的太空游戏，我不太擅长战斗元素比较重的游戏，如果有好心人推荐的话，万分感谢您（表情包.JPG） | Игра которая в 2016 году имела самый низкий уровень положительных отзывов в стиме (+-15%) вышла в лист топовых игр на площадке стима.

The bad part is that it does crash some times but its not that bad, often do you have a autosave spot close by and just play it from there. | Better feel then remastered version where they just made all the building and unit pictures smal in the map view instead of remaking them in lower resolution.

Bought the remastered but I dont play it. Still play the original even though it dont support my 1440p screen resolution | Still like when I played on a disk as a kid, except it lags a lot, the loading screen/main menu is blurry, and skirmish mode is unresponsive for a couple seconds. 7/10.

Every mission is unnecessarily drawn out and overcomplicated, allowing only one specific solution.

Shootas, Blood and Teef! | Bro this game fisted me for like 20 hours straight. An absolute blast to play and while i wouldn't play it over the others for any other reason other than the campaign now. Winter assault is still apart of one of the greatest RTS series ever.

I loved the winter themes and the imperial guard were awesome to play and god man the voice acting was so good!! The chaos and just bloodbath this campaign is, combined with all the snow and DEATH and destruction and the music that drums into your ears, It was epic, it was brutal and most importantly it was fun. Lifes short, play this campaign at least once :) and seriously the music is so good

76561198192893105,9450,"Warhammer® 40,000: Dawn of War® - Soulstorm",0.0,Strategy,0,"Dawn of War: Soulstorm remains a timeless gem in the RTS genre, and its enduring appeal owes much to several key factors. The graphics, while from an earlier era, have aged remarkably well. The detailed unit designs and atmospheric battlefields still capture the gritty, war-torn essence of the 40k universe, immersing players in the chaos of the far future.

The game’s story and factions stay true to the Warhammer 40k lore, delivering a narrative that resonates deeply with fans. Each faction feels authentic, from the relentless march of the Necrons to the righteous fury of the Sisters of Battle, ensuring that the gameplay aligns perfectly with the dark, gothic atmosphere of the universe.

Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Soulstorm is its vibrant modding community. Over the years, dedicated fans have kept the game alive and thriving, introducing new factions, campaigns, and quality-of-life improvements. Mods like the Ultimate Apocalypse and Unification expansions breathe new life into the game, offering a fresh experience even for long-time players.

For fans of 40k and strategy games, Dawn of War: Soulstorm remains an essential classic, as compelling today as it was at launch. | The greatest warhammer RTS game of all time

p.s. the best thing about this game is the mods
For the Emperor!! | The classic 40K RTS. Hasn't been topped since. It is an old game so expect bugs, but there's extensive mods and patches available. | The best strategy game I've ever seen, and the best game in the entire Warhammer 40k franchise | 原版已经很好玩了，在加个最终启示录mod，这游戏就更加好玩了。十分闲的时候整上一把，一小时就过去了。于AI单挑和红警3的AI都有挑战性。但红警的我一直没那时间弄，因为我红警有修改器（笑）。"

That's what SEGA does. They make a compilation but only one press of it, then they make a new version for the next consoles but it's worse. Then they put the games on Steam and remove them because they're working on ANOTHER compilation, this time with an atrocious UI, and later remove that as well. Mark my words, Switch 2 is coming out for way more money than reasonable and SEGA mentioned wanting to revive some of their popular franchises, two of which have since been made better by other companies, two of which were tried previously and came out awful - they're not making AAA revisits of the greats, they're making WayForward vibe games for $40 each and will pump out another compilation. I want to be wrong and say they're gonna give us gold but it's SEGA. Trust me, I want this to age very poorly but, c'mon, we care about them more than they do about themselves. | For its time, I found it a fair exchange to legally purchase ROMs without any BS. Unfortunately there's not as much money in that compared to repackaging them or putting them behind a subscription service.

I respect the original concept but not the decision of delisting it to avoid competing with yourself. A similar sentiment towards the also delisted Dreamcast Collection. | Realmente queria jugar varios juegos de sega genesis en esta coleccion. Compre este juego en un pack hace mucho, pero lamentablemente, no lo instale cuando lo compre. Y ahora a la fecha del 2025, resulta que ni aunque tenga el juego en mi libreria, me sirve poder acceder a la biblioteca completa de los juegos de Genesis. 
Al menos en la Switch pude comprar la coleccion y esos juegos se mantendran. Pero en mi Steam Deck, la biblioteca que aparece en la interfaz del juego es desalentadora, solo 2 juegos DLC aparecen. Una perdida de tiempo total. | I bought this “collection “ before it was pulled from the store. Once I DL it and opened it there was only one game in the collection. Golden Axe. Am I missing something? I thought it had more than 50 games in this like the others."
76561198192893105,228200,Company of Heroes,1.5833333333333333,"Action, Strategy",0,"FYI this review is about the single-player campaign. Never mind the WW2 setting, if you like real-time strategy or strategy in general, this is definitely a must-play. History buffs will appreciate the attention to detail and many nods to WW2 media such as Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan, as it portrays in part the efforts of the 101st Airborne during WW2. 

It's really nice to not worry about resource farming and just focus on combat. You generate resources by capturing territory, which is something you would be doing anyway. The infantry units are made up of squads which you control in their entirety instead of by individual units, and their AI makes them take cover, go prone while under suppressive fire, etc. Lots of variety in units and everything has a purpose, even builder units are effective (e.g., American engineers can use flamethrowers which are great against infantry and buildings). | If you want a good RTS campaign this is for you, its gameplay mechanics unique over the traditional RTS games of the time. | 거진 20년 된 실시간 전략게임입니다.

간간히 스커미시로 컴까기만 해도 충분히 만족스럽습니다. | A great WW2 RTS game that is easy to learn and pick up. You'll have no issues running this game in 4K max settings on your average hardware and it still look great.

You need to actually figure out how to move the heat somewhere else or convert it to another form of energy.

Cheating AI to compensate for being bit dumb is common practice in RTS games, but apparently the devs think that their AI is stupid beyond any redemption so they juiced all the cheating levers to the moon and the only thing that remains is artificial difficulty in the most boring and tedious way.

Raiding/attacking an AI is absolutely pointless unless you can actually destroy their main base. They're barely relying on population for their production and any villagers/military units you kill respawn almost instantly anyway so it's absolutely pointless to raid them.

The issue seemed a bit less apparent during the Campaign, so at least that part was bit better balanced. But trying out Conquest mode afterwards is just absolutely disgusting. It's doable, but an absolute drag cause it requires constant micromanagement to barely compensate for all the AI cheating. And even then it takes so long to finish off an opponent because raiding an AI does barely anything, so unless you're way way stronger the AI will just bounce back in the blink of an eye.

Bit of cheating would be fine, but I mean the AI units literally respawn like 2-3+ times faster, and their armies have barely any upkeep so it doesn't matter if you destroy their economy cause they will just field an army of 15+ units without any economy supporting them anyway. It's just a joke imo, this is not an actual challenge.

Please put some actual thought and at least a little bit of effort into your AI so the cheating doesn't have to be so blatantly in your face. 

It's a shame, cause the base game mechanics are interesting enough, the game looks nice visually and has a good theme. The campaign is decent and multiplayer might be fine, but beyond that the AI is a hot broken mess preventing you from having any fun. | Стратегия неплохая, особенно с друзьями, но отдельные кланы за 200 рублей каждый и сама игра которая стоит 1100 это конечно писдец.
 | Muy buen juego. La verdad desde que lo empece a jugar me dejo enganchado. Me gusta la dinámica que tiene. Tiene su nivel de dificultad, su banda sonora es muy bueno. El gameplay es muy sencillo, parecido al Age Of Empires. La duración de cada partida puede llegar hasta una hora pero vale la pena cada partida. Las diferentes estaciones hacen que tomes decisiones que ayuden a tu pueblo, ya que si tienen hambre, poca felicidad o están enfermos pueden ser un problema. Recomendado. | The amount of time I've put into this game is not a reflection of the quality of the game. It's a reflection of the very slow pace, and very steep learning curve. Basically, the first 30 minutes of any game, you're entirely on your own. You're competing against the elements, and trying to build up your colony. But then you encounter an opponent, and it becomes IMMEDIATELY clear if you did well to prepare for their invasion. Either you get steamrolled, or you do the steamrolling. There is not much exciting back and forth in this game, and it takes way too much time to get the repetitions in to figure out how to build up your base effectively. | Keep crashing on the Victory Screen.

Para os veteranos que se lembram do original, é um mimo nostálgico imperdível.
Um game obrigatório aos jogadores que buscam jogos de ação. | [h1]DOOM Review: A Masterclass in FPS Revival[/h1]

DOOM is nothing short of a triumphant return to form for one of gaming’s most iconic franchises. From the moment you tear through your first demon, it’s clear that this game isn’t just a reboot—it’s a love letter to the original while boldly forging its own path.

The gameplay is fast, fluid, and unapologetically brutal. The emphasis on movement and aggression creates a relentless pace that’s as exhilarating as it is empowering. Glory kills add a visceral layer of satisfaction, rewarding you for diving headfirst into the action instead of cowering behind cover. This isn’t just another FPS; it’s a pure, adrenaline-fueled experience that reminds you why shooters became so popular in the first place.

The level design is another standout feature, with sprawling, labyrinthine maps that encourage exploration without ever losing momentum. Hidden secrets, upgrades, and collectibles provide plenty of incentives to comb through every corner of the UAC’s Mars facility and the hellish depths beyond.

Mick Gordon’s thunderous soundtrack deserves a special mention. The heavy metal score doesn’t just accompany the gameplay—it amplifies it. Each riff and beat syncs perfectly with the chaos, driving you further into the carnage.

The story is refreshingly simple yet surprisingly effective. It knows it’s not the main attraction and instead focuses on delivering just enough lore to keep things interesting. The Doom Slayer’s disdain for protocol and corporate nonsense injects a layer of humor that contrasts beautifully with the dark, gritty setting.

Visually, DOOM is stunning. The environments are detailed and atmospheric, while the demon designs are grotesque in the best way possible. Every battle feels like it’s taking place in a heavy metal album cover brought to life.

In conclusion, DOOM isn’t just a great game—it’s a reinvention of a genre that many thought had lost its edge. It’s fast, ferocious, and endlessly fun. Whether you’re a long-time fan of the series or a newcomer, this is one hell of a ride you don’t want to miss.

76561198192893105,470310,TROUBLESHOOTER: Abandoned Children,44.28333333333333,"Casual, Indie, RPG, Strategy",39,"Troubleshooter is a tactical RPG. I liked it, and I respect it, even though I couldn't get into it. This game tries to do everything you can think of. It has a story with narrative choices and some complex presentation; it resembles XCOM and follows some of its conventions, but it actually plays more like Japanese strategy RPGs such as Disgaea. It includes class-switching, monster taming, character building through putting abilities into ""sockets,"" crafting, developing relationships with NPCs, and challenge modes for missions. It tries to do everything. 

Most of it kind of works. You'd expect such an ambitious indie game to look like an ASCII roguelike, but it even looks fine, I like 2D art especially. I respect that. It's still turned out to be too hard for me to swallow; the UI struggles to support even basic functionalities, not to mention more arcane mechanics. I'm not even sure how hit chance works in this game! It has an odd sensation of roughness where specific elements are fine, but they rub together in the wrong way. I like the music, but it's frequently used out of place; it feels like every track they have is meant to be played over a boss fight. The English translation is the final straw for me. While the writing is functional in gameplay, the story is barely comprehensible. 

I've said many harsh things about this game, but I still give it a thumbs up. This is clearly a labor of love, and it could have captured me under different circumstances; it has everything to become someone's favorite game. If your tolerance for jank is high and you're well-versed in the world of tactical RPGs, then definitely give it a try. Oh, and I don't recommend playing with gamepad, at least on Steam Deck it turned out to be more convinient to emulate keyboard and mouse. | I NEVER heard of this game until I stumbled upon it on sale and I'm so glad I took a chance on it. 

I'm greatly enjoying the character customization, the battle system and the battles themselves, the story is interesting, a well-done game overall.

Yes, you can tell the game wasn't written by native English speakers. Some of the dialogue and such has some quirks in it that make it read a little strange, but it's still understandable.

It's a minor wrinkle in an overall quality game. 

The way some of these characters attack is also funky. One girl kicks fireballs, for instance. Another character is basically a human pikachu. 

The setting is modern. Kind of reminds me of a Persona-ish combination of modern-style settings with fantasy mixed in. 

Combat-wise, you'll see a lot of referencing XCOM, and for good reason. The battle presentation basically is XCOM. There are a lot of enemies on the battle maps. I enjoy that as it makes more sense than a small scale battle...while sieging a whole castle or some such. You're attacking a gang's hideout or stopping an invasion force...and you'll feel like you're facing that. You'll often have guest characters on your side as well and, generally, they are useful and not just as meatshields. 

The maps are also large, adding to the feel that you're exploring a whole neighborhood/block/district. You can find items in chests and items you don't want/aren't better than your current gear can be salvaged for parts in the game's crafting system, where you can upgrade gear or construct new equipment. And of course, you can buy and sell items as per usual. There's also item identification. It's inexpensive, so it's worth revealing the full modifiers of a piece of gear before making a final decision on it.

Overall, if you like tactical RPGs or RPGs in general with heavy character customization, consider giving Troubleshooter a try. | No save function=terrible.
Just lost an entire mission right from the start of the campain. This has been a known problem for years.

MAKE A SAVE BUTTON. | I am about 15 hours into the game. I really really like the anime xcom, I even lovingly call it Squid Game Tactics when I speak about it. There's just so many casual quests, farms, repeatable missions you have to go through. It's the worst part of a Korean grindfest MMO in a single player (mostly) SRPG.

Starting around the lvl13-15 missions, map sizes, enemy numbers, and naturally, enemy turn timers increase exponentially. It becomes a slog through an enemy swamp. It becomes more annoying when the maps have height, since the engine doesn't handle it well (controls/LoS) and your units don't seem to get that much of a jump height or any tools to traverse it.

It's a great effort, I don't feel like I wasted my money, but I don't think I'll ever be seeing the ending of this game. If you like the Korean grind, go for it. | With higher budget it could have been the greatest. After 50h it became too grindy even for me. Too much running around without any challenge. I had a lot of fun anyway."
76561198192893105,475550,Beholder,0.4666666666666667,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy",0,"Beholder is an absolute gem for anyone who enjoys thought-provoking games that challenge your ethics and decision-making skills. Set in a dystopian world where you play as a landlord tasked with spying on tenants for a totalitarian government, the game artfully combines strategy, storytelling, and morality in a way that few games manage to achieve.

From the moment you step into the grim, oppressive atmosphere of the apartment building, the game immerses you in its richly detailed world. The art style is stunningly minimalist, with a dark aesthetic that perfectly complements the oppressive tone of the story. The haunting music and sound design further pull you into the game's bleak reality.

Gameplay Highlights:

Engaging Decisions: Every choice you make matters. Do you report a tenant for illegal activity to protect your family, or do you turn a blind eye and risk your position? The moral dilemmas are intense and often heart-wrenching.
Strategic Gameplay: Managing resources, time, and relationships adds a layer of complexity that keeps you on your toes. Balancing the demands of the government, your tenants, and your own family is no small feat.
Dynamic Storytelling: The branching narrative and multiple endings provide excellent replay value. Each playthrough feels unique, encouraging you to explore different paths and outcomes.
Why It Stands Out: What sets Beholder apart is its ability to make you reflect on your own morality. It's not just about winning or completing tasks—it's about what kind of person you choose to be in an unforgiving world. Few games strike such a perfect balance between strategy and storytelling, making every moment impactful.

Verdict: Beholder is a must-play for fans of strategy, narrative-driven games, or dystopian settings. It’s a unique experience that lingers in your mind long after you’ve put down the controller. I can’t recommend it enough—if you’re ready for a game that challenges both your mind and your conscience, Beholder is the perfect choice.

Rating: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 (5/5)

 | It`s quite a shattering game, which emotional impact keeps player`s attention at high rate (and not only because it is about spying). Would definitely recommend to fans of ""simulators"" genre, the game often strikes with difficulties of maintaining a stable life and making moral choices. Also would warn that the game can leave depressive impressions.

76561198192893105,481180,System Crash,26.65,"Indie, Strategy",16,"Decent enough cyberpunk aesthetics and story, but the gameplay is absolutely garbage if you have played more than a couple card games. The most basic possible mechanics, four lanes that autoattack with mana that scales automatically each turn, draw 1 per turn. Pretends to have more going on but the ""objective"" system is literally just life points but they count up instead of down. I had hopes from the intro, but every mechanical explanation depressed me further. Additionally, for a single player game, the drip of new cards is absolutely pathetic. It takes a couple dozen missions to be able to do anything you might reasonably call ""deckbuilding"", and meaningful synergies are at least 8-10 HOURS in. 

In the finer points, the hard control cards are also maddening. At the beginning there aren't that many, although the control for support cards is ubiquitous among the opponents, so playing the expensive ones is largely pointless. After you get to the point of ramp cards, hard unit removal, and lots of haste (no summoning sickness) cards showing up, it starts to feel more and more pointless to try and develop a board. The deckbuilding interface is also trash, with no search function for attributes, so building based on the synergies that exist is an absolute chore, and rebuilding your deck for specific enemy challenges is a pain in the ass. I was immediately turned off by the mechanics of this game, but I felt I had to give it a fair shake before leaving a negative review. The lazy card game mechanics just keep coming. Unless it's hiding 12+ hours in, there is nothing of interest you could find in this game that hasn't been done a thousand times in better ones.

Here are several much, much better games you could go play right now:
Faeria
Solforge Fusion
Runescape Chronicles (there's a fan run free version even since it's dead)
Netrunner (physical, still worth it, and if you want the cyberpunk theme, there's none better) | Highly recommended!

For me, this is one of the better CCGs:
- intuitive to pick up, there's quite some variation in cards and effects but nothing crazy (not like some not to be named CCGs that require a 15 page glossary to play)
- the mix between combat damage and ""hacking points"" is brilliant, it avoids that whoever drops the biggest creatures wins and also forces a certain pace in the rounds
- the layout is clear and works beautifully
- once you get past the initial rounds and have some credits to spend on customizing your deck, it becomes much more interesting and gameplay becomes much more varied; the initial rounds of both campaigns can be tough but a little deck adjustment goes a long way
- everything in the game from the story to the artwork, the cards and their effects all fits perfectly with the cyberpunk theme

RNG does have a significant impact but there's no penalty for losing a battle and the rounds are quite fast, so it's not that big of a deal.
There's the occasional hiccup when the game locks up but for the same reason, this is not a big problem.

I would have loved to have a few more campaigns (still need to try the Underworld DLC) but then again, I'm sure I will play though them several times more, trying different decks and approaches. And the arena mode is ideal if you only have a few minutes to kill."
76561198192893105,329280,Avalon Lords: Dawn Rises,0.06666666666666667,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Simulation, Strategy, Early Access",0,"I gotta say, this game has incredible potential. That being said, there are a lot of improvements that need to be made in order for me to give it a thumbs up. Yeah I got it, its an early access game, what did I expect? Well I'm posting this so the Dev's can see it and hopefully take my thoughts into consideration. 

Firstly, not everyone wants to play multiplayer matches. The single player skirmishes that you have are adequate at best. Currently there is only 1 map which does get old very quickly. The map itself is.. odd.. Its named Avalon plains but its packed with mountains. I got laugh out of that. Try making more maps and in all different types of terrain. Also, try making the match set up a little more intuitive, let me choose what factions I fight, and what is up with the time limit in a single player skirmish? That doesn't make a lot of sense. 

Please add more units and buildings, better factions with noticeable differences, special units depending on the faction that you choose, and Vikings.. You have to add Vikings.. haha. Maybe make an empire mode for single player instead of just multiplayer. Whats up with the Veteran infantry looking like Roman soldiers? I thought it was medieval times.

One thing that really bugged me was the way you place walls. Its really clunky and time consuming. In an RTS you can't have its take 10 minutes to lay walls down. The walls don't connect to the gates and vice versa. It looks like you tried to make it so you could place a gate in a section of wall and have it built there. This only causes the gate to get built in the same space as the wall and no units can go through. But I'm sure this will be fixed. 

At its current state I would give its a 5/10. I will reevaluate it again after more development has been done. Good luck Dev's and thanks for reading. | What a surprise! 

I heard about the game first, when they annouced to release on the same day as the new total war. Now SEGA moved that game away - maybe they were afraid? ;) However, first I could play the game at PAX East in Boston, a few days ago. There I found it very entertaining. It does a lot of things right for an RTS and finally we got one in a medieval setting again. Hell about time. 

The graphic needs some improvement, also the controls in combat are not optimal yet - but that is what early access is for. 
If you have any love for the battle-part of the Total War series but want to have some basic base-building and ressource-gathering in realtime in it - here you go! 

I really hope Early Access will help the game to grow content and quality-wise, then we can have real RTS-Diamond. 
So, please devs, keep on the good work! It will be a long and harsh road to go, but you will succeed! ;) | [b]Avalon Lords: Dawn Rises[/b] - jest to gra strategiczna czasu rzeczywistego, gdzie jako jeden z lordów podczas zaciętej rywalizacji musimy stawić czoła innym lordom (graczom) w trybie multiplayer.

Co ciekawe na oficjalnej stronie „Animusa” możemy dowiedzieć się również iż tuż po wydaniu Avalonu będą miały miejsce prace nad inną produkcją kryjącą się pod tajemniczą nazwą Ascendancy (pozostaje pytanie, skąd taki pośpiech, jestem zwolennikiem zdania „skończ co zacząłeś, a później zabierz się za coś innego” no, ale cóż jak widać wszyscy różnimy się pomiędzy sobą) i co najlepsze najprawdopodobniej również będzie to strategia czasu rzeczywistego. Mimo to ciężko jest określić czego możemy spodziewać się po owym deweloperze na chwilę obecną, gdyż jak już wcześniej wspomniałem jest Świeżakiem na rynku.

+ na plus zasługuje sam fakt, że jest to RTS (gdzie już od iluś lat rynek nie rozpieszcza nas, jeśli chodzi o ten gatunek),

+ na chwilę obecną gra jest w pełni darmowa (jednak może się to zmienić w późniejszym czasie i prawdopodobnie się zmieni ponadto, jeśli tak będzie można oscylować, iż gra prawdopodobnie będzie kosztować nas w granicy 20e),

+ na uwagę zasługuje to, że w grze nie występują obecnie żadne, ale to żadne mikropłatności (brak premium, brak bonusów zwiększających ilość doświadczenia, jakie wlicza się do rangi naszego profilu po potyczkach, które moglibyśmy kupić za prawdziwe pieniążki),

+ w grze lewelujemy rangę profilu, a co za tym idzie dostajemy tzw. punkty honoru, które później możemy wydać na zakupienie specjalnych perków zwiększających np. obrażenia zadawane przez naszych łuczników, szybkość wydobycia danych surowców czy obronę naszych fortyfikacji na czas bitwy (co prawda może to w późniejszej fazie zaburzyć balans gry pomiędzy graczami jednak na chwilę obecną sprawdza się całkiem nieźle),

+ ładnie wykonane menu gry (dość intuicyjnie),

+ jak na silnik graficzny Unity koloryt i ogólna szata graficzna wygląda nawet dobrze,

+ klasyczny model rozbudowy naszej posiadłości, pozyskiwania surowców, ulepszeń i walki (banalne nie zawsze znaczy złe w moim odczuciu),

+ możliwość obejrzenia gry innych graczy bezpośrednio z poziomu gry,

+ loading screen z objaśnieniem, które klawisze odpowiadają za daną akcję,

+ możliwość gry z innym człowiekiem bądź SI (gdzie SI często i gęsto będzie spuszczać nam manto, gdyż jest nieźle zaprogramowany bynajmniej w moim mniemaniu, jeżeli oczywiście zdecydujemy się na ten model rozgrywki),

+ odczuwalna dynamika walki (choć czasami odnosiłem wrażenie, że gra jest wręcz zbyt dynamiczna w niektórych aspektach),

+ karty Steam dostępne do zdobycia (co jednak nie wypływa na końcową ocenę),

+ osiągnięcia Steam (co również nie wpływa na końcową ocenę).

[b]Minusy:[/b]

- na chwilę obecną produkcja jest na tyle mało znana i na tyle niedopracowana (tak wiem, że to wczesny dostęp), że najczęściej przyjdzie nam walczyć przeciwko SI (w weekend w późnych godzinach wieczornych najwięcej graczy ile udało mi się dostrzec online to pięciu włącznie ze mną),

- może i teraz wybiegnę daleko w przyszłość, ale przydałaby się tutaj funkcja Anti-cheat, której obecnie brak, a w miarę jak gra stanie się bardziej grywalna i popularniejsza może pojawić się również sort graczy zwyczajnie nieuczciwych,

- masa błędów, bugów i glitchy (np. widząc opóźnienia w poruszaniu się jednostek niejednokrotnie miałem ochotę strzelić sobie w łeb (jest to raczej wina optymalizacji niż internetu), jednostki potrafią teleportować się z jednego miejsca w drugie niczym za sprawą czarodziejskiej różdżki, nasi wojacy niezwykle często nie reagują na nasze komendy czy w końcu sam fakt, iż u niektórych jednostek nie występuje funkcja auto ataku),

- ścieżka dźwiękowa niestety nie występuje, a odgłosy otoczenia przywodzą na myśl losowe pukanie metalowym narzędziem w to, co znajduje się w pobliżu,

- animacje są karkołomne i niedopracowane w całej swej rozciągłości,

- brakuje też opcji, jaką mogliśmy zobaczyć i doświadczyć w Rise of Nations gdzie do danej kopalni można było przypisać daną liczbę robotników, która była wyświetlana w statusie budynku,

- brak balansu pomiędzy jednostkami, a także mała ilość dostępnych jednostek, które można rekrutować (dokładnie mamy 3 typy piechoty, 3 typy jednostek zasięgowych, 3 typy kawalerii oraz 3 typy jednostek oblężniczych jak dla mnie słaba różnorodność),

- jak na razie w grze występuje jedna domyślnie przypisana dla gracza frakcja,
-do naszej dyspozycji zostały oddane jedynie dwie mapy potyczki (jedna dla maksymalnie 6 graczy druga zaś dla 4 graczy),

- używając automatycznego utworzenia pokoju rozgrywki czekamy na graczy aż do 5 minut (spokojnie można w tym czasie zrobić sobie kanapki i herbatkę, a nawet zdążymy je skonsumować nim czas upłynie),

- niejednokrotnie mamy problem z połączeniem się z danym pokojem utworzonym przez inną osobę,

- po zwycięstwie lub porażce nie można powrócić do głównego menu, gdyż najwyraźniej skrypt za to odpowiadający nie działa więc jedynym wyjściem jest wyłączenie gry przy pomocy menadżera zadań (na szczęście pozyskane doświadczenie mimo to zostaje dodane do naszej rangi profilu, a tabela wyników zostaje zaktualizowana),

- brak samouczka/tutorialu wbudowanego w grze,

- brak możliwości zmiany ustawień klawiatury tym samym brak możliwości przypisania danych akcji do innych niż domyślne klawisze.

[b]Podsumowanie:[/b]

Moje pierwsze wrażenia z rozgrywki w Avalon Lords: Dark Rises nie pozostawiają złudzeń, przez co mam na myśli mianowicie to, że jeśli deweloper w tym przypadku Animus Interactive Inc. będzie kontynuował pracę nad swoją produkcją w niedalekiej przyszłości możemy dostać naprawdę dobrego i wysoce grywalnego RTS’a. Na chwilę obecną jednak Avalonowi daleko do takich produkcji jak Battle for The Middle - Earth czy Age of Empires, a nawet wspomniany już w tym artykule Rise of Nations. Mam nadzieję, że tym oto wpisem choć trochę rozwieję wasze wątpliwości. Na razie gra wypadła dla mnie dość blado jednak otrzyma ode mnie rekomendację, a sam deweloper duży, a wręcz ogromny kredyt zaufania. Będę nadal przyglądał się temu, w jakim kierunku idą prace nad tym produktem i jeżeli tylko coś się zmieni ta recenzja może ulec mojej edycji na korzyść bądź niekorzyść tego tworu.

Wersja gry: v.0.2.6.202

[b]01-10-2017[/b]

Do tego czasu nie ukazała się żadna aktualizacja do Avalon Lords co może świadczyć o tym iż gra jest martwa. Myślę, że nie muszę dalej argumentować zmiany mojej oceny.

[Moja ogólna ocena (10 luty 2017): **słaba

[b]Moja ogólna ocena (1 pździernik 2017):[/b] *gra niegrywalna | I love the idea of Avalon Lords. Age of Empires + Total war and a little Planetside thrown in? Hell yeah, sign me up! 
The only thing is it needs a lot of work before I would recommend making the purchase. Though it seems like the Developers are putting in work and taking time to listen to the community, which is something I really appreciate.

The Good

-The city building is pretty well done and certanly feels a bit like AOE. 

-The map is very beautiful and has good terrain. (Notice the lack of plurality, I'll get to that later.)

-There's a nice level up system for your profile, which lets you upgrade stats like the endurance of your units, percent increase in resource yield and decrease build times.

-The units are aesthetically pleasing on come in nicely packeged squads.


The Not So Good

-Sometimes unresponsive units.

-Seems to be only one map.

-The in game tech tree that doesn't really explain what the tech does or how much it costs.

-There needs to be more emphasis on formations. It's very dificult to set up lines of units or to organize your army which often causes battle to turn into a mosh pit of random units.

-I'm not sure if I'm just blind or what but I couldn't find a Fire At Will button for ranged units. Adding one would make city razing SO much easier. 

-Lastly the AI is currently battling at the same tenacity of a two year old with a yet newspaper. Which for certain game mods is pretty bad. | I enjoy playing this, even thought it still needs alot of work it's still fun, there is one thing about Avalon Lords, sometimes when your army is on the move they float above the ground instead walk, but what can you say ? early access and it's free to play"
76561198192893105,327030,Worms W.M.D,10.4,"Action, Strategy",6,"It's moderately good. Maybe it's even a 2nd or a 3rd best Worms game. However, it's still lacks a lot of, a lot of things compared to good old WA. Physics engine is near as good as it was 26 years ago and many skill based mechanics were cut for some reason? The devs either didn't care to actually implement them, or they did it for the sake of brainless gameplay that the modern audience would be more likely to enjoy. New vehicle system is unbalanced as it could be and literally everyone in MP just abuses them, because they give an unfair amount of advantage (I absolutely cannot comprehend how could someone test it and say ""Yeah, it's good"").
Also no custom soundbanks support as of 2025, I guess Team17 were busy making that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ battle royale no one asked for.

If you want the true ""Worms experience"", I strongly advice you to buy Worms Armageddon. It's still getting updates from time to time and still work amazingly on modern systems. | It's good but too slow, can't recommend. No way to speed up animations and skip a lot of things. If the gameplay was more snappy like older Worms titles it would be fine. | A game with chaotic multiplayer mayhem. Worms WMD is a blast! Make a team, grab a couple of buddies both local or online and watch as you each take turns trying to blow each other up, asking how the hell did I miss that or what just happened? 2D destruction, worms using sheep bombs and holy hand grenades, a strange but lovable concept. Worms has been and always will be one of the perfect games to play with others | Hard to believe it's been 9 years already from the last great Worms experience (Rumble was a mistake). If you're a fan of Armageddon/Reloaded/World Party you owe it to yourself to check this one out. Cool new additions to the classic formula like vehicles, pleasant artstyle, plenty of campaign/challenge missions to master, great variety of weapons and that specific humour, it's all here. It's actually a bit surprising how well this game is after pretty bad Revolution/Clan Wars/Battlegrounds era. So yeah, WMD is pretty much a diamond shining between two bad franchise periods, it's puzzling that Team 17 didn't iterate on it and instead for almost a decade only came up with a failed experiment (plus Armageddon remaster for consoles). | szczerze nie polecam zły system skakania ograniczone bronie gdy boty mają bez limitu"

В итоге забыл, зачем вообще пришёл в эту деревню. Местные жители, кажется, тоже в шоке — они ждут, что ты спасёшь мир, а ты пытаешься вспомнить, где оставил своего коня. И да, стрелы в коленях, кажется, стали новой модой. Если вам нравятся приключения, где можно забыть обо всём на свете и просто наслаждаться хаосом, то Skyrim — ваш идеальный выбор! | entrei fiz o tutorial morri tres vezes no tutorial, finalizei o tutorial e fui pra uma vila ataquei sem querer uma vaca uma mulher começou a me seguir com uma faca, voltei pro save antes de atacar a vaca fui testar as teclas e apertei shift + z os aldeao veio tudo pra cima e morri fiquei 30 minutos procurando o botao de sair. melhor jogo q joguei ate agr
 | I swear, I spend more time modding & tinkering than playing this lovely gem. Back then I had been enjoying this beauty for hundreds of hours on another platforms. 

So far, I've downloaded and deleted more than 4 thousand mods around 400 GBs. Will eventually start playing the game continuously once I setup a proper smooth modlist.. Fingers Crossed. I

Oh, the game? Absolutely 10/10. Despite of the game being released for the 97432nd time, still get's my septims nevertheless.

Just.. try not to get overwhelmed by the mods.. Otherwise, you'll end up like me.

Edit: I've found my dream modlist! It's: Nordic Souls. Literally the perfect modlist. | In 2011 Skyrim basically saved my life. I wasn't allowed to leave the house, my mom was really really battling mental health issues. And there I was. 16 going on 17 cooped up. But I convinced her to let me get this game that everyone was raving about and bam man. I know it's not as good as Bethesda other work bla bla bla. But to me. Skyrim is THE game. Ever since becoming an adult I've purchased a copy on everything I own. It's like a reminder or having a favorite book and seeing all the editions. 
I'm glad I was able to play this game, and I'm glad we're able to share our stories here on why we love the games we do. | Играю в это творение с самого его выпуска на просторах интернета. Некогда меня посадил в нее брат, и это была лучшая рекомендация по играм, которую он мог мне когда-либо дать. Цифру, которую видят пользователи рядом с моей иконкой, это может, дай Бог, 1/10 часть всех проведенных часов за этой игрой. Да, когда выпускалась игра, мне было 9 лет, и я играла по своему незнанию и неумению с чит-кодами, тем не менее, освоившись с годами, поняла, что куда интереснее, когда имеешь риск, чем читы, которые ограничивали и делали тебя непобедимым. Да, всех фишек игры вдоль и поперек мне узнать по сей день не удалось, и я к этому не стремлюсь. 
Эта игра стоит того, чтобы вы ей уделили внимание, как минимум потому, что это огромный открытый мир с неимоверно широким выбором заданий. И, лично я, до сих пор не видела в гейминге игр, которые бы хоть чуть-чуть сравнивались с ней. Не спорю, опережая негативные возгласы, есть уйма других не менее проработанных хороших игр, но, по моему мнению, это не то. Skyrim тот самый прорывной проект 2011-го год, который до сих пор держит геймеров у экранов, так и вовлекая из года в год перепройти его заново.
Запуская игру, ты идешь туда уже далеко не ради графики, ибо, конечно, стоит признать, что для 2025-го года это уже не аргумент. Ты идешь ради неповторимого сюжета, который всего через пару игровых сессий так и просит подпевать бардам в таверне ""Герой он бесстрашный, он непобедим..."". Ведь герой, Довакин - это ты, человек неопределенной расы, который неведомым образом попадается на пересечении границы и оказывается тем, кто спасет весь мир. Причем игра дает возможность спасти Скайрим абсолютно разными способами: как будучи воином в драконьих доспехах с секирой Вутрад наперерез, так и крысой из Гильдии, тыркающей противников на х10 урона бритвой Мерунеса. Продвигаясь по разным сюжетным линиям, ты обретаешь многих верных сторонников (даже включая продажных наемников в тавернах, которые в последующем могут и отдаться Боэтии ради тебя). Некоторых из них имеется возможность брать в напарники, в зависимости от направленности твоего персонажа: нужен ли тебе лучник или  шут с кинжалом. Надоело рубить драконов, сражая их своим воинственным голосом? Пойдем, отыщем лук Ауриэля и будем жечь вампиров. Не хочешь? Пошли выпьем с незнакомцем в баре по кружке эля и узнаем, что тот даэдра гулянок. Хочешь тихой семейной жизни? Купи участок, построй особняк своей мечты и устройся там, может быть даже с мужем/женой и детьми. 
Устав от всех этих историй и геройств, ты можешь просто взобраться на холм под вечер с чистым небом и наблюдать за звездами. Звездные каскады - это не менее прекрасная причина прогуляться по просторам Скайрима и его окрестностям.
А для любителей мультиплеера создатели придумали онлайн версию, с которой вы можете также ознакомиться.
Но есть и свои ""-"" у сие произведения. Наиболее сущей проблемой стали для меня баги, когда я впервые зашла в официальную версию игры. Особенно по отношению к  компаньонам: передвижение в виде чистой модельки, исчезновение их частей тела, застревание в приседе, отставания от главного героя на половину карты и даже невозможность их выхода из локаций. В таких ситуациях спасают некоторые коды и частые сохранения, однако оставляет неприятный осадок. Тем не менее, это даже иногда забавляет и добавляет юмора в серые будни средневекового главного героя.
Даже спустя 13 лет после релиза, мне не надоели эти образы, байки, сюжетные повороты. Это как хорошее вино, с каждым годом только вкуснее. Смакуйте, друзья, а потом идите в не менее прекрасные проекты, как этот!"
76561198192893105,491950,Orwell: Keeping an Eye On You,2.0,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation",4,"ui风格我很喜欢，但无法和恐怖分子共情，所以不推荐
我是个比较肤浅庸俗的人，不在乎什么政治和主义，也不想卖弄学识，更不想伪装能从以肤浅目的写出来的肤浅剧情里解读出任何自以为是的大道理，尤其是当：1、在监视问题上，倾向于说教（即使游戏中唯一能干的事就是收集隐私），就像冰汽时代“这值得吗”一样不仅没有起到本来想要的效果，还排斥了游戏性，光这点就已经无法跟原著比较，2、作者好像完全不知道该怎么描写监视系统的负面表现，3、[spoiler]听从朱丽叶的结局[/spoiler]被暗示为一个积极（甚至富有远见）的结局时。这几点让这游戏像是软科幻儿童读本而不是致敬1984的产物
我不在乎什么高大上的思想，我只在乎死了的人他们再也不能说话，牺牲的必然不代表它的理所当然
思想与其说是组织不如说更像心智不成熟的初中生组织的社团（[spoiler]有些成员在谴责朱丽叶的恐怖主义行为时似乎并不坏，和前面他们煽动民众杀害雇员小哥形成了某种有趣的反差——监视系统最多让嫌疑人蹲号子，而且通过走关系能够逃避制裁。[/spoiler]）
如果作者真的认为这个组织能够体现原著的内核，那么毫无疑问他的努力是失败的

补充一下游戏内体验问题：鼠标经常点不到显示冲突的按钮，要抓住选项没有消失的瞬间才能切换到冲突片段 | muito maneiro, gameplay sensacional, mas acaba rápido | Anfangs war ich etwas Skeptisch, was Orwell angeht. Es wurde mir durch einen sehr guten Freund vorgeschlagen, da er wusste, dass ich spiele wie ""The Operator"" absolut feiere. Sagen wirs mal so: ich wurde NICHT enttäuscht. die ganze Aufmachung des Spiels ist etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig, allerdings ist das Zweitrangig. Für jeden der sich in solche Art von Mysterien fest beisst ist das hier eine absolute Goldgrube, so viele unbeantwortete Fragen, es ist so verstrickt, dass man In der ersten Stunde zwar schon ein ungefähres Bild bekommt, was passiert sein muss, aber durch die Anzahl an Personen die in der Geschichte vorkommen, einfach keine handfesten Theorien aufstellen kann, man wird mit Brotkrümeln gefüttert, aber man wird nicht Satt davon. Absolut geiles Erlebnis, freue mich auf Teil 2.

Ach, und die Dialoge sind teilweise absoluter Lachkick. Spiele für gewöhnlich Sachen nur auf Englisch, aber die Deutschen Texte sind sehr Realitätsnah, von Internet-Trolls bis absolut grenzwertigen Beleidigungen alles dabei

100/10

Könnte ich meine Erinnerung an das Game löschen und es nochmal spielen, würd ichs tun. | When my only real complaint is why isn't there more, that's not really a problem. The fact the writing and score make a text-based story compelling and chilling enough to keep me glued to my seat shows how well written this game is. | Allora, innanzitutto va detto che il gioco è solamente testuale (molta roba da leggere, sia utile a stabilire un ""ambiente"" realistico, sia informazioni) perciò non aspettatevi azione nel senso classico, piuttosto aspettatevi di indagare...e riflettere, anche se sul secondo punto sono abbastanza confuso.
C'è poco da aggiungere al titolo, Orwell cita ovviamente l'autore di 1984 dove in una società distopica, le persone sono costantemente spiate per il bene di una nazione in cui non esiste alcuna opposizione.
Orwell è la piattaforma che andremo ad utilizzare, ""l'occhio"" del governo che attraverso indiscriminate ricerche e libere estrapolazioni di dati da social media, account bancari, cellulari, computer, dati medici e via dicendo sarà nostro compito assicurare alcuni ""terroristi"" (se lo siano o meno è vostro compito scoprirlo, e qui un altro problema che sorge) alla giustizia.
Qual'è il confine se esiste fra privacy e sicurezza? Ci abbiamo già rinunciato entrando nei social media e dando le nostre informazioni a qualsiasi sito le chieda? Paranoia o realtà? Se non abbiamo nulla da nascondere, cosa ci importa? 
Ma quali sono i criteri per esseri considerati ""un pericolo""? Magari si comincia con cose serie ma poi si arriva al conformismo totale sospettoso di qualsiasi differenza?
Queste solo alcune delle domande che il gioco pone, forse in maniera un pò ""guidata"" (alla fine la libertà di pensiero significa che il pensiero non deve essere influenzato) in certe parti, ma se all'inizio può sembrare avvincente indagare e collegare punti fra i vari indizi che prenderemo senza troppi scrupoli con qualche click da diversi metodi....alla fine rimarrà un pò di amarezza.
Perchè ...se capitasse veramente a voi? Mettiamo sia tutto complottismo e paranoia, ma se potesse accadere?
Non siamo poi così lontani, e le notizie del gioco rimandano a fatti reali ovviamente con nomi e tempi diversi.
Lo consiglio, non dura molto, si finisce in 7 ore, è completamente tradotto, ci sono delle piccole sbavature (soprattutto confusione fra gender o nomi di persone, o frasi tradotte troppo letteralmente dall'inglese)
Non credo comprerò il seguito, totalmente in inglese e che a quanto ho letto non è pari a questo.
Non mi ha ""sbalordito"" enormemente, ma fa pensare sia in termini di soluzione di alcuni ""enigmi"" che di temi etici.
Molto pratica la UI e piacevole l'utilizzo di ritratti disegnati in modo molto minimal.
Consigliato a chi ama i giochi di scelte e conseguenze che poi scopri che era tutto un equivoco.

The mechanics are all quite cool, but for me the entire design falls apart on one fatal flaw. I usually play these kind of games to do some quick up to one hour long runs in the evening. However, with this one, two evenings in a row, the runs ended up in a lengthy slog that almost lasted past midnight. And the worst thing was that the gameplay did not even change very much during those 2+ hr long runs, I just eventually felt like I was doing the same thing over and over again. The resulting boredom and loss of concentration (which is highly required ALL the time or you will lose fast) made me perform worse, so I did not even win in the end.

Idk, it just feels like it is a game for a different, more slow-paced era than this one. There are just so many more interesting games of the same genre, that spending 50+ hours to unlock most the different content of this one seems highly unlikely for most gamers imo."

Now honestly, this game is to me more of a Batman ""Cartoon"" rather than a game, yes, you can make choices and there are on-rails game mechanics, but really there isn't an ending where you lose, it's a really casual game.

honestly, the story, the cinematography, the voice acting are frankly amazing.

I admit seeing a more casual Bruce Wayne is really interesting, Catwoman/Selina's character is probably my favourite character in the game, this is probably one of the best adaptation of her.

Cobblepot/Penguin is a really good antagonist,[spoiler]I'm not really sure what to think of the twist with Lady Arkham to be honest.[/spoiler]

I'm currently playing on Classic mode, I honestly haven't tried Shadow Mode yet, but it doesn't seem worth it if it's just a black & white version of the original.

Also I'm playing it through Proton on Linux and it runs perfectly, plus the game is rather well-optimized. | The game was truly fantastical, it was story rich and the fact that one can make their own choices and steer the story to their own taste is what makes this game different from others.. would recommend to others since i fully completed it and I enjoyed it at every turns. | WWBD? Turns out it's not always what you think (or want).

This one just isn't on the level of the best Telltale games. It feels more on-rails throughout, most of the choices aren't compelling, and by the midpoint, the clunky storyline has become thoroughly nonsensical even by comic book standards. By Episode 4, I was just ready for it to be over.

Many more people died as a result of my decisions than those I was able to save. But I suppose that is the reality of the job, and it certainly gives me a deeper respect for those who do it in real life.

The game emphasizes the importance of the daily decisions they must make. It's humbling to grasp the magnitude of the responsibility that comes with being an emergency dispatcher. It serves as a reminder of the value of rapid thinking and remaining calm under pressure in such vital moments.

So, while I may have killed more people than I saved, the game taught me a newfound appreciation for real-life dispatchers. It's intense, challenging, and very eye-opening. If you're up for the challenge (and possibly accidently letting a few virtual life slide through the cracks like I did), it's definitely worth a shot. Just don't expect to always feel like a hero... | Ever wanted to feel like a dispatcher? Be overwhelmed by calls and telling emergency services where to go? than this might be your calling. 
Together with it's succesor 112 Operator this game achieves this amazingly, putting you behind a dispatcher desk managing and coordinating crews of emergency services including medics, firemen and police, and the many varients that you can think of. 
Some calls just pop up, others you actually get put into a dialogue to answer, over time these calls can become repetitive, but not every incident can be something unique or special.

It used to be a tradition for me to play [i]Life is Strange[/i] every New Year’s Eve when visiting my childhood home. So many memories intertwine with it. Jumping up and down on the bed losing my mind after the 3Ep twist. Bugging my classmates with a basket of theories and insane lore about the game's development. Cutting my hair slowly bit by bit until it eventually resembled Max's. I learned Spanish Sahara by heart and played it non-stop on the ukulele I begged my parents to buy. Even the wall of my room was decorated in Max's style – a tradition I carry to all the homes, or the resemblance of homes, I've changed along the way. In 11th grade, I made Max’s journal from scratch, it was one of my favorite pieces in the room, taking a notable place among my own personal and school diaries. I remember playing the 4th episode on a school week until 6am and going straight to school all hyped and simultaneously out of it. When Episode 5 came out, I sobbed for two weeks! My best friend at that time and I woke up so early that day, purposefully missed school, and spent all day immersed in that final chapter – her watching a live stream and I cursing at my old computer unable to handle Max’s time jumping shenanigans; of course, taking occasional breaks for comparing our declining emotional stability. [i]Life is Strange[/i] carried me from that final school year straight to University, helping me figure out some stuff about my own life along the way; as it did to many. Every time I turn it on now it just turns into a crying fest. From love, of course. But also sorrow.

Over the years, I’ve read so many players' intimate recollections prompted by the game's content; random snippets of people’s most vulnerable life stories sprinkled over each social media platform. Simply something awoken in people of all ages and backgrounds, perhaps by the game’s mellow nostalgic aesthetics and unabashed willingness to attune to the finest memories and emotions of our hearts. It was rather pleasant to witness the resurgence of [i]LiS[/i] fandom in late 2024, collectively reminiscing on our intimate interaction with the story, the newfound change in perspectives, and the passionate desire to mutually share all the warmth we still have for its characters. 

Living through Max was foundational for me, a self-conscious girl growing into confident adulthood with innocence violently ripped away from her. It was simply an average coming-of-age process, growing up and seeing a world from a different perspective, learning to connect and empathize with those around, learning from them and finding our own flaws and desires, recognizing them and growing to be better. But also a darker experience of going through my own sexual assault, of losing my own innocence, shifting and modifying the self to perhaps be more cynical and pragmatic, of maybe seeing the world through a darker yet necessary lens. Yet, ultimately, all of it forming one unified identity that is nevertheless a beautiful landscape of variable experiences and lessons; adulthood. I will always love the character of Max dearly. I will always cry noticing the gradual change of her vibrant diary doodles to objective, subdued in color entries with each passing chapter. I will always cry for the innocent love Max finds in non-innocent circumstances. The exploration of Max’s fractured mind following the violation will always mean the world to me, back in 2015 making me feel seen and motivated to start my own tumultuous journey of healing. I will always be grateful for Don’t Nod creating this beloved gamified companion to project our own internal worries onto, our transformations, and dreams; to reach intimate answers through a bittersweet, meditative experience.

[i]Life is Strange[/i] maintains sheer gratitude and wonder for each part of our environment while not rejecting the truth of the shadows stretching over the world’s corners. Finding beauty in the industrial powers of small towns, their nature, expansion in infrastructure, transformation of beliefs, unique differing people, and their interconnected messy ties to each other: as colleagues, students, friends, lovers. Finding beauty in the contrast of lives cut short, resentments, domestic disputes, destructive truths, violence, and uncertainty of tomorrow. Creating a living, breathing town that wishes to continuously evolve, grow, and adapt to the changing population making up its geographical landscape. Rachel Amber’s character is perhaps the most compassionate interpretation of Laura Palmer’s image I have seen, Chloe’s uncensored journey of clawing through grief calls to the most helpless moments of my own 19old self, and the understanding of violence captured in a human-shaped form still wounds me deeply: of course, so much of [i]LiS[/i] was inspired by and carried love for David Lynch’s legacy.


It's not so much the content of media; over time it becomes something bigger than its key narrative points. Rather, the events it accompanied in life, the memories you associate it with. That's when stories become truly dear to the heart no matter the years passed. It simply evokes a subdued feeling, like a thread granting the privilege to time travel to your own thoughts, memories, tastes, smells, relationships, places.

I tried replaying this game in so many locations now it can be drawn onto a map, like a shi+ty road trip. But I never lasted very long, about 30 minutes before I lose my cool completely and start thinking of the hand-drawn picturesque walls of my school. Of the captured memories sprinkled over my walls. Of the path to my home from school, from my friends, from the center, from my mom's job, from the park, from the waterfront. Of the last school days and giving away my books. Of getting closer with my classmates and finally understanding how similar we are. Of looking out my window, the windows of my friends, the windows of my school – and seeing sunsets, sunrises, golden hours, whirlwinds, blizzards, screeching hot days. Of dark days. Of town spots I avoid. Of town spots I wish could stay with me. A living breathing town… trapped in hazy, fleeting pieces of memory. Out of reach, a resemblance of something that used to be, overwritten by new places and people – when it's one of the last anchors you have to that past you cannot go back to. Learning to hold the value of delicate memory, accept darkness, and cherish its lighter undertones.

Finally replaying the game after these years, I’ve been finding new connections with Arcadia Bay, of the radical shift it makes from a nostalgic warm town to a harbor of ruin. How it strongly encompasses both, yet neither. I’ve been thinking of how the geography of my town has been modified, its prior identity forever wiped away. I’ve been countering the grief of losing childhood physically and emotionally with the fleeting traces of glee that used to be. On dark days, I will always hold on to the memory of sitting on the hot-to-the-touch boulder stone with my childhood friend, giggling about our new life developments, surrounded by forestry of a quiet park and bright sun. Of looking around me and seeing kids become more expressive in their identities, unafraid to look, think, and love however they please. Of regularly visiting my school and checking in to see if the asphalt drawing we made in dedication to our class teacher has faded away, or the chamomiles covering the school’s entrance are still greeting the children. Of peaking outside from the large plants covering my mom’s windowsill and seeing the rose we have planted outside slowly rise and bloom. Of always having a prepared 2h15m playlist to accompany me on the trip to my town from the nearby big city.

Nowadays, [i]Life is Strange[/i] transports me to the hot summer days of my home. 
I will always be grateful for having a chance to time travel. | I've been wondering for a long time whether ""Life is Strange"" is a game I could recommend or not, since it has very positive reviews and a slew of fans. I also expected such an experience. Unfortunately, I have to admit that the game disappointed me. Don't get me wrong, I fell in love with the demo version (chapter one), which promised an elaborate crime story with several suspects and lots of decision-making. We were introduced to the characters along with our heroine (Max), as she was new to the school. It promised a story full of excitement, mystery and consequences of our choices.

Unfortunately, after purchasing the full version of the game, with all the chapters (21 hours played), the spell faded in several different ways:

1. The game turned out to be a delusion of the consequences of the choices (except for the final decision at the end - although this one is disappointing in terms of the logic of the choice and the realization of the consequences, especially in the case of one final).
 
2. The game deliberately distracts us from some characters, completely forgetting them as criminal suspects. Because of this, we are unable to gather evidence in their case. Which is then supposed to cause surprise, shock, etc. - A cheap, ineffective ploy.

3. Overly cinematic final chapters. At one point in the game, there was so much story told in interludes and stills that for most of the chapter, the player had nothing to do but minor linear activities that contributed nothing. This killed my immersion and and even more my sense of control and decision-making.

4. Little bugs. The ending cutscenes have a number of close-ups of characters talking without their mouths moving. There are so many of them that at some point it becomes uncomfortable. The time reversal system is also sometimes unintuitive and can erase a decision even though it was not intended.

**[Warning: little spoilers]**

5. Final decisions: It is supposed to arouse emotions, but whether it does so is not necessarily the case. The first ending looks good and emotional, but the second one is dull and bland. In addition, it shows that everything we did throughout the game is irrelevant to our protagonist Max (all the friendships we've made, the lives we saved, etc.). That's not how you write good endings.

6. Imbalance in the characterization of the characters. Just as most of the characters are good written (they have their own motives, secrets, behaviors and are believable), I cannot say the same about two of the main characters who should arouse sympathy - Chloe and (maybe) Warren.
The friendship between Max and Chloe is, in my opinion, completely one-sided. Chloe uses Max's skills like a toy, she doesn't accept criticism, she's explosive and I didn't get the impression that she actually cared about her friend or even respected her, her character and way of being. Thus, he forces her to engage in various activities, even though Max points out that such activities are not to her liking or even can hurt her. Despite this, Max keeps repeating wonderful words about lifelong friendship and can also create a love bond with her. The only positive aspect of Chloe's character is at the end, when she realizes all these elements and talks about them, and makes her first unselfish decision.
As for Warren, he's written strangely. He's supposed to be a geek with a crush on Max, and he basically is, but throughout the entire game I had the impression that there was something strange about him and that he was hiding something. | 沉浸感无敌，剧情不拖泥带水，就是克洛伊像个啥币，看后续剧情发展吧 | This is one of the best video game stories ever told – a true classic.

They produce games known for their complex meta narratives, fourth wall breaking and unexpected game play twists, and The Hex is no exception to this. Especially the latter is extremely present in this case: far from a singular gaming experience, this is a combination of wildly varying genres and tropes, stringed together by a complex non-linear narrative with multiple twists and turns. There are moments when it almost becomes a study of game genres and techniques, nudging the player to question their preconceived notions of game design. The story itself is thrilling, strange and even flirts with horror at times.

Due to the sheer scale of this project, the individual quality of each new game play section isn't necessarily always up to the same high standard. Moreover, there are slight pacing issues as some parts last longer than they need to.

These sporadic quality and pacing problems aside, The Hex is still a wonderful and captivating experience, filled to the brim with wild ideas.

也难怪老刘会直呼2025年度游戏（）靠自己摸索出独特机制后突然间豁然开朗的感觉确实欲罢不能，而且这种体验也容易让玩家进入心流状态。
[h3]--谜题设计以及隐藏路线[/h3]
谜题设计缺乏深度，玩法上还是稍显不足。况且由于地图太过于空洞庞大，可能大部分时间都花在跑路线找谜题上。（这里顺带吐槽一下俄罗斯方块谜题，完全不明所以，玩家的视角没办法了解所有俄罗斯方块的全貌，导致哪怕解出来了也是一头雾水，翻转视角的时候只能祈祷它不要出现奇奇怪怪的阻碍）
后期有隐藏路线连通主线各个地图，初见时候确实很惊艳，利用好这些隐藏路线也是完成“不放置上帝方块通关”这个成就的方法之一。然而就是因为隐藏路线和隐藏结局的存在也暴露了游戏的缺憾与不足之处，个别隐藏实在刁钻，打个比方：像在人民大会堂周围找一个小老鼠洞。在完成隐藏结局的过程中，许多时间花费在大地图里跑来跑去运方块，途中的大楼梯又臭又长，没有设计感可言。

Unfortunately this game did not deliver for me.

I found the core gameplay to be quite limited and boring. Essentially all you do is one of two things in this game, either 1) retrieve an item or  2) beat someone up. There's other mechanisms to attempt to make things more challenging or interesting but they fall short, for example there's locked door or security defense systems, but you can just easily blow up walls and get to the objective quite easily with little resistance. Even with random level generation it doesn't add much lasting value, as you still do the same objectives but with a slightly different level layout but without much added challenge.

The gamepad setup and multiplayer support really sucks, it's very difficult to setup multiple game pads and steam deck support is non existent. Menus require the use of a mouse to navigate, so not ideal with just a controller. It takes me at least 10-15 minutes to get 3 game pads synced up right. And then on multiplayer you all share the same game camera so you all have to stay close to each other. The game appeal wears off after like 20-30 minutes. The UI is very busy with lots of wording.

The level art design feels like you're in an underground subway and not in an open outdoor city environment. The level sizes are pretty small and limited. Personally I would have found the game a lot more appealing if it was more like GTA 2 with a larger city map and vehicles to drive and wide roads and going inside multi level buildings to complete one more challenging objective. Perhaps the enemy could try to flee and you all have to work together to chase or trap them. I think that 1-4 larger static maps would beat random small map genration for this type of game.

I'm hopeful for Streets of Rogue 2, but if it's too much like this one I don't think I'd buy that one if it has this same setup and limitations. | I can't just pick this game up and stop going run after run.

Think of it more like a virtual shooting gallery.  

You have to be patient and slow if you want to tag the most difficult animals, so tweakers, tryhards, and sweatyboys should probably stick to TheFinals. You can literally walk for 20 minutes and fire only one shot.

The thrill is the hunt.  I could not ever hunt these animals in real life, not for sport.  Here though, let's blast away whatever we can find.

The APEX engine is a beautiful thing, but water performs poorly when backdropped behind tress and foliage. Environments are breathtakingly gorgeous.

No bugs.  No bugs at all. Like, flies, mosquitoes, bees, blackflies.  You don't get cold, either.  Or wet. 

Sometimes these huge maps feel unnaturally void of life, but then I remember: this isn't really a hunting simulator.

Draw distance for animals is about 400 yards.  

A lot of essential equipment (like the ATV and the Bloodhound) is accessible only by DLC.

Having said that, you can get a great package deal on this game often.  If you're interested in this game, I highly recommend that you wait for a good discount on a package that contains a few maps, a dog, etc.

They say you can play with friends.  I haven't tried that yet.  I just like to go on adventures and walks in the taiga, south Africa, New Zealand, Nepal, etc.

What started as a random game I was willing to try out turned into one of my favourite games of all time and a real-life fondness for everything outdoorsy.

DLCs expand your experience in a worthwhile way. While there's something to say about the amount of DLCs this game has, I'd argue they're worth the price when on sale. If you're brand new, get the ATV, tripods, tents, and the bloodhound, along with a weapons pack of your choosing and whichever pack has the digital caller.

Pokud za tu dobu připadne mapa někomu okoukaná, hra má za svoji dobu 9 let nespočet DLC s novými mapami a s novými druhy divoké zvěře. Hra skýtá i několik velice vzácných úspěchů - jako, že je odemknulo pouze 0,4 % hráčů ze 100. Zmíním dva nejvzácnější, 10 ran do srdce lukem Alexandr (DLC Silver Ridge Peaks) a dokončit všechny vedlejší úkoly v DLC Quarto Colinas, což také není jednoduché, protože hráč musí na závěr ulovit zvíře s diamantovým hodnocením, nejvíce možným, což se mi podařilo zatím pouze 2X.  Takže je to určitá výzva, kterou mě plnit bavilo nejvíc na hře.

Zápory:
- Stopy, jsou všude a někdy je to velice nepřehledné, pokud míjíte zóny potřeb zvěře, nebo stopujete stádo a přitom ještě lovíte jiný druh, aktivní stopy se přepínají (podle toho co zpozorujete dalekohledem) a po té už nedovedete dost dobře sledovat původní stopu, řešil bych to 2 aktivními stopami, jedny pro pozorování a jedny pro stopování  odlišené jinou barvou.
- Zvuky při průchodu některé trávy, zvuk jako by se zasekne a nejde se ho zbavit, i když už je postava mimo porost.
- Zaseknutá zvěř o terén (většinou příkré svahy), ne, že by mě to vadilo, kolikrát mi to pomohlo ulovit zvíře, ale kazí to inteligenci zvířat a celkový dojem při hraní.
- Při jízdě v ATV zvěř nejde zranit, spíš ona zraní vás, což je dost trapné a nereálné.
- Balistika zbraní taky není nejlepší, do 200 metrů trefíte všechno přesně, pokud to není v pohybu a nad 200 metrů musíte navyšovat optiku v puškoměru pro zásah a počítat se zpožděním.
- Výdaje peněz za postavení úkrytu, nebo posedu, výdaje za nocleh.
- Chybějící animace některých činností, kde je klasicky černá obrazovka, chybějící NPC (jediná postava ve hře jste pouze vy).
- Chybějící fotorežim.
- Žádná, nebo skoro žádná hudba.

Klady:
- Dechberoucí grafika některých scenérií, zejména při východu a západu slunce
- Pestrobarevné, rozdílné mapy i biotopy při koupi různých DLC (všechny kontinenty).
- Získávání bodů za lov pro koupi lepšího vybavení (není možné mít všechno od začátku hry, pokud nevlastníte DLC).
- RPG systém pro rozdělování bodů do oblasti schopností a perků a možnost si je za poplatek resetovat (není možné mít všechny schopnosti najednou a max. level je 60).
- Inteligentní divoká zvěř (zvíře pozoruje, větří, prchá, vábí), každé zvíře má jiné chování a jiné časy zóny potřeb.
- Mnoho druhů zbraní a vybavení, včetně vábniček.
- Sbírání sběratelských předmětů.
- Možnost preparace za poplatek a výstavy nejlepších ulovených trofejí ve výstavních boudách (nutno DLC).
- České titulky.
- Z fotoaparátu jdou fotky rovnou do knihovny steam, kde si je můžete upravovat a sdílet (snadno si potom můžete procházet příběhové momenty).
- Pokud máte s kým hrát je možnost lovit ve více hráčích a to nemusíte vlastnit ani DLC stačí, když ho bude mít host, pouze nejde plnit příběhové úkoly.
 
Tato hra mě zprvu odradila pro její náročnost a nepochopení chování zvěře, ale vrátil jsem se k ní po několika letech a můžu říct, že mě napodruhé příjemně překvapila, ať už množstvím DLC, nebo již zmiňovanou inteligencí zvířat a získanými zkušenostmi s hraní. Vřele doporučuji pro lidi, kdo milují tento sport. | 目前主程式的兩個地區已經快通關了，
燒了720小時...
鑽石級也只捕獲到黑雁。

這遊戲怎麼說呢...
新手教學很爛，有等於沒有。
你要學著注意以下事項

1. 不要隨便站著跑，除非你要開圖(前哨站&瞭望塔)，不然不要開車 & 站著跑動
那個噪音跟顯眼度會在 200~300米外，就嚇跑你所有獵物。

2. 注意小樹叢或是茂密的樹下，蹲在內讓眼睛閉起來(顯眼度最低)，獵物要10米內才能發現你，善用仿生哨把獵物吸引過來。

3. 請拿出你的耳機，左右聲道會很明顯聽到獵物踩草的腳步以及通過樹叢的聲音，可以藉此聽出牠要從哪個方向走過來。

4. 基本上如果用走路的方式 300米外大多數動物絕對不會發現你。有遮蔽物，獵物難度越高獵物發現你的距離大概是130米~180米，距離越遠，難度越高；距離越近，難度越低。

5. 如果要追獵，跑到200米左右就要開始蹲下，因此全程蹲著快走，靠近100米左右後就要趴下了。

6. 在空地用槍射擊，會增加大量的狩獵壓力，一個地區打滿三隻基本上就要換地方了，打到第四隻會產生死亡級的壓力，會導致獵物全部避開那個地區並且消滅居住地(進食、飲水、休息)。

7. 如果想要埋伏在一個地區大量狩獵，建議找個埋伏建築住進去，如果沒有埋伏建築可用，持弓也會有相同的效果，但持弓射擊的距離很近，難度也很高。

8. 等級太低，太菜要賺錢，就去打大雁 & 鴨子，打起來很爽很有成就感。"

Having played Civ 7 for a few hours now, I can say that that those of us who truly loved and still love Civ 5 judged Civ 6 too harshly when it released. It changed some things that people liked, but I still found many of its new features truly enjoyable on launch. I had fun. I still preferred 5, but in 6 the art, the music, the innovations to unrest, espionage, religion, and--to a lesser extent--city development were all excellent. Heroes are cool. The roster is cool. Civ 7 has little that is as redeeming in it at launch and I wholeheartedly recommend 6 instead. | Great game and recommended if you are a strategy player.

Але важко уявити, що в 2025 році ми все ще змушені бачити у світі ігор проросійські наративи. У новій версії гри розробники ""відзначилися"" черговим ігноруванням української локалізації та повного ігнорування української нації, яка переживає героїчну боротьбу за своє існування та незалежність.  

Анонс нового персонажа, цариці-душогубки, яка нав'язується як ""символ культури та просвітництва"", виглядає як зневага до мільйонів українців. Героізація імперіалістичної постаті — це не тільки обурливо, але й аморально в контексті війни та окупації, яку сьогодні переживає наша країна.

It's hard to believe that in 2025 we are still witnessing pro-Russian narratives in the gaming industry. In the latest version of the game, the developers once again ignored Ukrainian localization and completely erased the Ukrainian nation, which is heroically fighting for its survival and independence.  

The announcement of a new character, a tsarina-murderer being portrayed as a ""symbol of culture and enlightenment,"" is a slap in the face to millions of Ukrainians. Glorifying an imperialist figure is not only outrageous but also immoral in the context of the war and occupation Ukraine is enduring today.  

Ukrainians deserve respect in the gaming industry, not an attempt to promote imperial narratives disguised as ""cultural values."" Enough with the propaganda! We demand full Ukrainian localization, Ukrainian heroes, and characters that truly reflect our history, culture, and struggle."

Just a nice simple game. | A fun game that is easy to learn yet can be quite difficult at times. Once you start playing it continues to captivate you with its thematic artwork and excellent humour. A must try for all deckbuilding fans! | A fun game held back by some limitations in gameplay, some dungeons you just don't draw the map tiles needed to accomplish the goal in a reasonable amount of time. In others you get some powerful items offered and you just run away with the game.
There is some interesting gameplay in the simple style and very simple UI helps this. I didn't have any problems learning how to play the game. (initially I did when I had never played a card game before, and came back some years later to give it another shot and found it comically easy after playing several games now)

You'll lose a few adventurers just down to bad luck, sometimes you'll just get wrecked by being forced to fight an enemy  above their level. And sometimes you (or at least I) make mistakes, it happens but those mistakes can cost your adventurers their lives, something the game makes very clear to the player and it's not even meant to be a big deal, more adventurers will sign up very quickly.

So the interesting thing about this game is the maps are basically randomly generated from a set of tiles/enemies and loot. You build the dungeon, ideally towards a specific goal (kill the boss, collect X gold things and so on), unfortunately it's not quite as fun as it sounds. You'll sometimes get some very strong enemies you have to place, other times you'll get swamped with lots of low level opponents on the map and the dungeon will feel like a chore.
There's a little bit too much rng in what map cards are offered, and no way to edit or adjust the drawing of cards for that mechanic.

The actual combat is fairly quick and once you get to grips with the game. I'll say the first level or two of your adventurers seems to be when they're most vulnerable which is problematic because this is when the players are first using them, so most folk will never find out the stronger versions of your little gang of adventurers. (the traits can be powerful)
The biggest issue for me is that hp is just a bit too important, just a single point is enough to swing the outcome of some fights. 

You get to customise them but it's very basic, some hairstyle changes, rename them and a choice of 1 male or female voice. I started to get glazed eyes after customising my 8th or 9th adventurers, at some point the random visuals don't really matter, all that really matters at least to me was being able to complete the dungeons without losing the adventurers.

The level ups for the adventurers were a little limited, I think they mostly got +1 hp and after completing a dungeon they got a trait. I would have liked a bit of a skill tree to open up, rather than yet more rng.
The only real choice the player has in character customisation is what item they get to pick when they get the option in each dungeon.

The game is okay overall, it functions well (as it should, it's pretty simple in presentation). But eventually I saw through most of the mechanics over time and became a bit disappointed in how it wasn't simple enough to just let me have a fun time (adventurers die pretty easily), or complex enough for me to feel in control (lacking higher levels of customisation in various areas). 
Yet the game is fairly hard, particularly when you're first fighting a type of enemy for the first time in various types of dungeons. Once you get how to beat them it's no big deal, but until that point it's not a fun time.
It is however quick, each run is easily 30 minutes to complete or less so it's hard to feel to upset about it.

Honestly if I could offer on a sliding scale of review somewhere in the neutral region between positive and negative I would. (when I was having fun it was close to 8/10 experience, when I wasn't it was more like 3/10.  I don't know how to boil that down into one score)
You might enjoy what's on offer if you're really curious but for the most part new games do most of what this one does better and in more advanced and/or intuitive ways. 

Ever since slay the spire came out it's hard to argue anyone buy this game over something like that. Or even darkest dungeon. Or a whole host of other card games/rpgs if you want that kind of experience.

I respect this game for trying to tie together card games and dungeon delving but it just wasn't quite there for me. Not strong enough card mechanics to engage me on an intellectual level and not strong enough story/setting to get me immersed in the world/adventurers. Too hard to let me take it lightly and too comedic for me to take it seriously.

Anyways I'd still like to thank the devs for giving it a shot and working on the game for a good while after it came out. So many other devs just abandon projects if they're not immediate successes. | Oddly fun cheeky little game.

Rating: 9/10
Verdict: A richly crafted and unforgettable journey through the ruins of a Soviet wasteland. Highly recommended for RPG enthusiasts! | It's ""meh"". They really wanted to be Fallout 1/2, but somehow they managed to copy all the bad, outdated stuff while only bringing over some of the good parts of those classics and then layered their own, partially bad game design on top of it.

The game is unbelievably clunky, tedious and annoying. Everything from movement to inventory management to combat, feels like you're wading through molasses. Why do I have to go into a menu to see my buffs and debuffs? Why not display them in the corner of the screen with a tooltip on hover and a timer? Why is there no direct audio or visual feedback when I get irradiated or poisoned and why do I have to open a menu (again) just to see the exact values?

Want to use an item real quick? Open your inventory, drag said item into one of your hands, exit the menu, then click the item in your hand slot and click on yourself to use it. Wait for the animation to finish. Done. It was a stimpack and you need two more to fully heal? Do everything again. And again. Why not allow using items directly from the inventory with a single click? Or implement a hotbar or something. Strangely, some items (like books) can be used directly from the inventory, while others require this whole convoluted process.

Then there's the lack of tooltips when hovering over items in the world. I basically have to guess what I'm looking at. On top of that, a lot of gameplay mechanics are poorly explained. For example, I still have no idea how stealth actually works in conjunction with pickpocketing and lockpicking.

I even played the game with Cheat Engine's speedhack at 1.5x speed + unlimited carry capacity and it was still a slog.

All this jank and tediousness was fine 30 years ago (I played FO1 and FO2 back in the day), but it's 2025. A bit of QoL, polish and iteration on the gameplay wouldn't have hurt.

Traveling is a slog too. Forget something in a location and want to check real quick? Have fun walking painfully slowly across the map all the way back. Then you get hungry and have to rest. Then you get ambushed while resting... you continue and get ambushed again and so on... everything just takes forever.

Balancing is a mess, and your companions are basically walking death wishes, seemingly determined to get themselves killed at every opportunity.

The writing has its moments, but most of the dialogue is just... there. NPCs rarely say anything interesting and a lot of conversations feel like they exist just to fill space. There are frequent weird tonal shifts within the same conversations, too. Serious and dramatic in one moment, then suddenly goofy and cringe. Not sure if it's a translation issue and the original script is better, though. Eventually, I just started skimming through dialogue, only stopping when something actually seemed interesting - which unfortunately didn’t happen often.

It's not all bad - there's definitely some charm here and there and when things click, you can see what they were going for... but I dunno, man... I think you're better off playing Wasteland 2 & 3, Underrail or even the original Fallout 1 & 2.

I've heard Trudograd fixed many of these issues but since it's the direct sequel and from what I gathered you're supposed to play ATOM RPG first, I don't know if I'll ever get to it. | An interesting role-playing game in the spirit of Fallout, maybe there are not so many variations, but the number of quests, characters and locations is enough for 1-2 plays, if your character is not suitable for everything. (and it can be edited).
Also there is almost no karma, so there is no crime in the wastelands if there are no laws!"

The whole design is incredible, the visuals and soundtrack create such an impressive atmosphere. I also love the gameplay since the puzzles and monster confrontations are fun and clever yet not frustrating, in my opinion. I'm additionally quite content with the pacing as I didn't perceive it to be rushed despite its rather short length, the only thing that makes me sad is the fact that I can't enjoy the game for longer lol. 
Moreover I enjoyed how the first two chapters are fully horror and terrifying, meanwhile the second half is mainly sad and upsetting story-wise, yet still manages to keep up with the disturbing atmosphere. In my opinion the narrative is quite well done, which made me very invested in the story. I really enjoyed the way how several dark topics got combined into one tragedy and also how impactful the presentation of everything is. I initially didn't expect myself to end up so hyped and emotional while playing this lol.

 | [h2] 用童话去讲述一个伤感的故事 [/h2]

游戏主要内容：讲故事&解谜

[b] 讲故事的部分： [/b]
这个游戏主要就是讲述主角和妈妈在现实世界和童话世界中冒险帮助他人的故事。现实世界和童话世界有一定关联，会相互影响。故事一路温馨有趣，童话感十足，但在最后急转直下。最后才发现被游戏温馨的外壳骗了，最后的反转真的很棒，合情合理，扣人心弦，催人泪下，颇有点睛之笔的感觉。

[b] 解谜的部分： [/b]
抛开故事，这个游戏还有一部分解谜。难度偏简单，但是要在大屋子跑来跑去到处调查，有些微繁琐，卡关经常是有个角色没对话或者是有个角落没有调查。解谜是比较常见的类型（毕竟是17年的游戏了），没有什么独创性。有些追逐战之类的，也不难，被抓住了也不会game over。前期中期的解谜还可以，后面基本就是一本道，没啥解谜要素了。

[b] 觉得一些不足的地方： [/b]
1.作为一个剧情为主的游戏，演出效果太平庸没亮点，要是演出效果再好点就好了。特别是煽情的地方能配上CG就好了。
2.好多角色立绘都没有。比如暴躁老头的女儿[spoiler] 对不起，记不住你的名字 [/spoiler]，童话世界里有立绘，但是现实世界的就没有。
3.游戏刚开始基本所有重要角色都出场了，信息有些密集。一开始逛街不知道干啥，没有个主要目标。
4.解谜略显乏味，现实世界和童话世界可以相互影响的设定感觉还可以再深挖一下，创造更多迷题。
5.主角不能跑步，移动慢腾腾的玩久了好难受！！！！！！

[b] 总之： [/b]
这是一款值得一玩的剧情像素解谜游戏，一开始觉得乏味的话请坚持玩下去[strike] 毕竟是17年的老游戏了，游戏性已经落后了。 [/strike]，游戏从中间开始就变得越来越有趣！ | Well this made me cry a lot so 10/10 great game"

[h2] 简短的游戏评价[/h2]

游戏流程大概100h+，可玩性很高[spoiler] 费脑子 [/spoiler] ，游戏内有众多的武器以及装备（EGO）可以搭配，每天有不同的考验需要面对，看主管运气的同时也需要主管的优秀管理能力，非常适合喜欢管理类游戏的玩家入手！！（还好我是死鱼脑），游戏的难度适中，整体的游戏难度集中在后期收容异想体多了之后和每个部长的核心抑制以及46-49天。标签打着恐怖的但是游戏是没有任何恐怖内容的。[spoiler] 面壁女:? [/spoiler] 游戏的剧情世界观做的非常好，非常适合去体验游戏剧情，此外游戏剧情衔接到了月记的下一个游戏废墟图书馆(Library Of Ruina)和边狱巴(Limbus Company！！！)（小唐音），脑叶公司是月记三部曲的第一部曲！[spoiler] 恭喜你成功入坑月记 [/spoiler]在这里强烈推荐一下b站up主灰色渔歌的脑叶公司剧情大电影的视频（不是水军，单纯推荐），但是建议各位主管先通关了游戏再去观看，详细介绍了脑叶公司的剧情和大概的世界观.


[h2] 给新人主管 [/h2]

恭喜你成功来到世界之翼，在这里你将开启你辉煌的人生[spoiler] 无限重开的人生 [/spoiler]

[b] 下面是给新人主管一些小tips（没有剧透） [/b]
1.新入坑的主管一周目可以放心的选异想体喵~（千万不要选介绍是粉色字体的异想体啊kora！）
2.因为是第一周目，所以在第一周目打出游戏结局是很难的....新人主管如果实在管理不了了可以放心的选择回到第一天喵~（真的不推荐）
3.介绍一下游戏的存档机制，首先在游戏内研发出的ego是不会随着你回到第一天而消失的，所以不用担心！（需要注意的是员工死亡会丢失身上的ego）但是员工是会随着回到第一天就消失的。其次，记忆覆盖日（也就是游戏的第1,6,11,16,21,26,31,36,41,46天）,[u] 在这一天所选择的异想体是不能退货的！！！！！！[/u]（回到记忆覆盖日把异想体退货，算是游戏的一个小技巧）所以一定要在记忆覆盖日的前一天结束工作选择新的异想体的时候慎重选择！尽量不要选择一些非常难管的异想体喵~
4.在一周目可以选择玩到20-25天抑制了[u] 培训部部长Hod [/u]的核心再选择回到第一天然后打结局（如果你觉得你在一周目获取的ego够好而且员工等级够高的话可以选择玩到36-40天抑制了Geburah（惩戒部部长）的核心再回到第一天）
5.那什么是核心抑制呢？核心抑制可以算是一个游戏内存在的一个小挑战，在核心抑制中主管会正面与部长对抗,部长会给主管出五个任务，完成五个任务后会进行该部门的核心抑制，（小提示，在抑制该部长的核心时，该部门的异想体时不会融毁的,中央本部Tiphereth的核心抑制除外）此外，核心抑制给的奖励也非常的丰厚，特别是Hod,Geburah,Binah(研发部部长)的核心抑制奖励喵~
6.介绍一下什么叫异想体的融毁[strike] 我不知道有没有新人会不知道这是什么东西，反正我新手的时候一时半会没搞明白是什么 [/strike]，在每天工作时会有一个融毁等级（最高10级），每次工作到下一个融毁等级的时候会让全图内随机个数的异想体收容单元发生融毁，需要将员工指派到收容单元来解除融毁警报，简单来说就是，工作了这么久，有收容单元出问题了，需要派员工去看看怎么个事。[strike] 让我看看怎么个事.jpg[/strike]
7.关于我是否需要加班？总的来说，推荐多加班，我推荐是在10-25天内可以高强度加班，因为26天主管就要开始面对午夜考验了！（紫午夜警告.jpg）前期加班效率不高，10-25天刚刚好，后期加班需要看午夜考验给的什么了，只能说后期纯看运气。（我是后期轻微加班培养战神员工，一般来说每个部门只需要安排三名员工就够了，其中包含一名战神员工）
 

[h2] 异想体推荐 [/h2]

[i] 这里所推荐的异想体都是前期新手主管非常友好的异想体，包括管理，ego强度综合考虑 [/i]

1.Z级(ZAYIN级)推荐
[b] 【F-05-52 韦尔奇乐牌汽水】 [/b]本能洞察两个工作基本不会出差，洞察压迫基本上也不会出差，但是工作最好集中在本能和洞察，前期练级好帮手！
[b] 【T-09-85 我们可以改变一切】 [/b](工具类) 没错！虽然看起来很可怕，但是，他不会融毁，没错！它，不会融毁！！！！

2.T级(TETH级)推荐
 [b] 【T-06-27 1.76兆赫】 [/b]员工跑不快？攻击太慢了？正义等级低？那就去狠狠的压迫1.76兆赫吧！前期提升正义等级的好异想体，而且很难把计数器降到0，即使降到0了，压迫四次自动乖乖回到收容单元喵~
 [b] 【O-02-56 惩戒鸟】 [/b][spoiler] 这是什么？可爱的小鸟！摸一下 [/spoiler] 可以进行三个工作。本能洞察沟通都可以！练沟通很好用！出逃了千万不要镇压！！！鸟大爷日常遛弯不用管喵~
 [b] 【O-05-61 破碎盔甲】[/b]ego非常强力！T级拥有H级的武器！！！还是高贵的蓝伤！！！！！！一直本能工作就可以了，切莫沟通和压迫喵~
 [b] 【T-09-77 渴望之心】 [/b]（工具类异想体 携带型）没什么好说的，携带后增加员工的生命上限和攻击速度，让战神员工拿一天就可以了，不用还喵~

3.H级(HE级)推荐
 [b]  【F-01-37 冰雪女皇】 [/b] 婚姻介绍所（确信），可爱的冰雪女皇！可以练本能洞察沟通三个属性，而且没有计数器！！！完全不用担心融毁！！！！是非常适合练员工等级的异想体喵！ps：为什么叫婚姻介绍所呢？因为员工工作有概率被冻住（差为大概率）而这时候，只需要派出五级勇气的员工（五级勇气成功率为100%，四级为80%，以此类推）解救一下，然后两人永结良缘！（bushi）[解救后两个员工都获得非常强力的饰品]
[b] 【F-01-69 魔弹射手】[/b] H级有着W级的武器ego，在前期非常强力，武器可以攻击到一条线上的所有生物（包括自己人），可以进行本能洞察压迫三个工作，不容易掉计数器，不会出逃，即使计数器归零了也只是在公司随便开一枪，有概率生还。护甲ego非常强力，H级的甲拥有三抗0.7（红白黑0.7，蓝抗1.5）。是个前期适合练级而且ego强力的高产能异想体喵~（后期就不要带魔弹出门了，容易出事，别问我怎么知道的）
[b] 【O-01-67 蕾蒂西娅】[/b] 可爱！！！工作的时候只需要注意只派一名员工一直对蕾蒂西娅工作就好了，同样是一个适合练级的异想体,可以练本能洞察沟通三个属性，同时ego护甲和魔弹射手的ego护甲一样，H级三抗0.7,但是ego武器黑伤相较于魔弹射手dps略低（5.5）

4.W级（WAW级）推荐
[b] 【T-04-05 蜂后】[/b] （建议主管在拥有处决弹和有能力处理工蜂的情况下再收容）蜂后总体来说算是比较好管的W级异想体（我的看法），工作主洞察,一直将工作结果保持到优就可以了。如果管理的好可以获得两件三抗0.7的W级ego护甲（算是在W级内比较香的）和两件dps较高的（7.5）的红伤武器ego。但是缺点是如果主管没有能力处理工蜂和没有处决弹的话蜂后就会变得比较棘手。
[u] (((注：工蜂是在蜂后计数器归0后释放的黄色使职员死亡（包括文职和员工）后会将职员转换为工蜂，此外工蜂所击杀的职员也会在死亡后转变为工蜂)))[/u]
[b] 【O-02-62 审判鸟】[/b] 审判鸟的工作伤害为蓝伤，所以建议在主管拥有1.5的蓝抗甲和一名血量约100的员工后再对其进行工作，工作主沟通，或者主管可以考虑先收容着再去工作，不是文保协异想体可以放心收容，优点是如果成功摸出了审判鸟的ego你就可以获得一件全抗0.5的护甲ego和蓝伤的神奇武器了！算是中期较为强力的武器喵~
[b] 【O-01-73 绝望骑士】[/b] 非常乖的W级异想体，工作主沟通,我在游玩了这么久从来没让它出逃过，管理简单，只需要保证第一个对绝望骑士完成结果为优的工作（同时员工会有一个标记）不死就可以保证它不会出逃了，什么？你问我出逃了怎么办？esc重新开始这一天，（比a级更有威胁性）ego非常强力，白伤剑dps9.5，ego护甲全抗0.8（可以用来摸审判鸟了诶，好耶！）

5.A级(ALEPH级)推荐
[b] 【O-03-93 碧蓝新星】[/b] A级里面最好管的异想体，没有之一，正常工作非常难让他出逃，非常适合作为新手主管收容的第一个A级异想体，前提是员工的自律和谨慎等级必须为五级！！！！！（或EX）工作主洞察，工作白伤,ego武器dps12.55,算是很好的了，护甲为正常的a级水准，（三抗0.4,蓝抗1.0）什么？你问我出逃了怎么办？？？？文职酱sayonara~

前！期！千！万！不！要！收！容！的！异！想！体！！！！！
[b] 【O-01-45 疫医】[/b] 虽然属性上是Z级异想体，但是工作优12次后会永久变成【T-03-46 白夜】强烈建议主管不要在没有能力镇压白夜之前收容疫医，造成后期获取失乐园武器ego变得极为困难！！！！！！！！！由于疫医转变为白夜以及选择使徒有些复杂，此处不在赘述。

Cons:
Can feel repetitive after a while
Limited variety and content as you progress

But by the time I was 'finished' and cleaning up with achievements. I really understood.

The game feels very unfinished. The story feels all over the place and is really confusing, nothing like the first game which was very clear in it's story and goals. One major issue is a bug with the workshop menu that only allows you to go back to the main menu and not select anything. This causes three achievements to be completely impossible to get. I found a steam thread with the same issue all the way from 2020, with a dev response. So this bugs been present for minimum 4 years with the devs aware of it.

The DLC is just... worse. I only got it for the dog, and it's really the only good thing about it. One of the levels with the frog has several bugs, including an objective that doesn't proc, which makes the other objectives incredibly difficult to achieve.

I was really excited to play this, I loved the first game. But this just feels like a cash grab. Rushing to feed off the hype of the first game. I can't recommend this. Just play the first game. | Devam serisi olarak ilk oyunun yapısını işlemediğiniz için berbat olmuş. İlk oyundan bağımsız olarak yapılmış bir oyun olsaydı güzel bir oyun olarak karşılanabilirdi. | El juego se superó con creces respecto al primer juego, muy recomendable da igual el precio que tenga."

I beat the final level after 4 hours and ran out of fun around 8. Unlocking harder and weirder ways to beat the same levels you've already seen was not compelling to me. Still, what is there is polished and condensed to perfection. | I really want to like this game, and I have liked other games from this publisher and the genre. However, the roguelike elements of this game are more about punishing new players with ""gotcha"" moments, where your ignorance of the game mechanics is severely punished. Such as certain squad/mission combos are not winnable, though you can still unknowingly select them, but new players wouldn't know this until they figure it out through trial and error. The learning curve is more about ""really?"" moments of frustration than intuitive insight into how to play the game.

This game is an example of how we need an option between ""yes"" and ""no"" on steam reviews. If these types of roguelike games are for you, then I can see the appeal and there is surely a place in the genre for this and games like this. It's just not for me. | 一个设计很巧妙的战旗roguelike游戏，规则简单，策略丰富。可选战队蛮多的，战术多样，无愧于各方面都打磨到堪称完美的独立游戏。 | Good difficulty level - just hard enough for good solutions to feel satisfying, but without being too punishing.

76561198192893105,599140,Graveyard Keeper,2.316666666666667,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation",8,"A game that while i first enjoyed on console replaying it on PC reminded me how good yet how AWFUL this game is. A great game with and interesting story and fun mechanics to start. But horribly grindy later on with the story falling over time and ending in... an interesting way. A game i have with a love-hate relationship with and likely will play again only to feel more disappointed. | This game is hard to recommend so I won't.  TLDR;  Feels like a game that had a rushed and patchy finish with features being dropped or stripped.  Late game is a huge disappointment.   Zero replay-ability.

Late game brings what initially promises to be automation using zombies.  But apart from wood collection all other zombie jobs just make more work for you.  So the early game grind gets replaced with late game grind supporting the zombies.  The zombie farmers need to be restarted each time and the gold seeds they're using slowly diminish leaving you with the side job of hand growing more seeds.  The vineyard is up a cliff right next to your house but you have to run half across the map to get to it.  Gets very annoying and there is no late game staircase to get you up there quickly.

Corpse processing becomes a bore and almost pointless once the graveyard is full.  I would have expected ashes to be handled properly such as needing to put them in an urn right after you burn the body.  Instead you just collect your ash arbitrarily in stacks and craft the urns in your...kitchen?  In the end I found myself processing corpses only to collect blood to feed my speed potion habit because the game quickly becomes intolerable without it.  And with a maximum of one blood per day available you need to conserve those potions. 

The dungeon is a random collection of halls leading to pointless rooms with no rhyme or reason.  It feels like a complete afterthought.  Maybe just checking a box for the screenshot.  The lighting is bland and uniform throughout.  No mood lighting.  No ambient sound.  On the plus side combat is much better than most other games similar to this.  

The restrictions on placing workbenches etc seems like a half baked idea which just ends up being annoying.  You can't move things, only destroy them, losing most of the materials.  Since you have no idea what you're going to add later in the game you are forced to destroy and rebuild in order to fit new stuff in. Quality of life aspects like this seem to have been overlooked.

The church was the biggest let down for me.  I was so keen to get the final upgrade and bling out my cathedral to the nines.  But that never happened.  There are very few late game things that can be added.  You simply don't get extra bench rows.  There are no crucifixes, no fonts, no bells, no memorials.  The stain glass window was in my build menu for a long time and I was looking forward to the moment a glorious and massive, bright new stain glass window would twinkle in the central position at the head of the church.  It would be it's pride and joy!   Nope.  It's a tiny, dull turd of a sprite with no effects that you can only only place on the side.  The church is one of the central things in the game and a wonderful opportunity to let the player get creative.  It failed to provide that.

The alchemy felt like a lot of extra bloat was added by making it so each reagent has a powder, liquid and extract form and sometimes a goo form.  The trial and error style of finding new recipes is asking way too much of the player forcing wiki lookups in order to maintain sanity.

Quests were a mixed bag. Some were ok but many can be summarised as fetch quests involving many people and so many things to fetch or make or grow in a sequence.  Some of those characters only show up once a week leading to annoying delays in story progression.  Some quests will even have this delay with a single character who will say something to the effect ""Ah, great, you got that thing for me.  Come back next week and I'll give the thing I promised""  Ugh!

It's a no. | This is a mixed review honestly, the game starts off great but really falls off near the end unfortunately. It has a great art style and a good soundtrack, the writing is above average, overall it's a chill and relaxing game. 

The shortcomings it has are small but numerous, such as tasks becoming a slow and painful chore, poor UI such as workbenches not being able to bulk craft some recipes for no real reason, not being able to cancel crafts, e.t.c. It's a lot less sandboxy that what I expected, which was a letdown, as the Church turned out to be a disappointment in the way you can build inside. 

Overall, decent game, not for everyone, but not bad... 6.5/10 | Complex yet simple to learn.
Its way easier to reach automation comparing to the similar games in the genre. and heck thats satisfying!!!
if u love stardew u will love this as much! 10/10 | 很肝，但是很好玩，新手引导做的很一般，前期最好先去查一下攻略。顺便问一下制作组会不会出新的DLC或者续作，期待一下"

I put over 500 hours into this on PlayStation 5 and just got a PC and got it here too.  There are three characters/stories, and they just get better as you progress.  The world building is deep, and the stories are impressively well written.  There are a few scripted encounters in each story, but there are also random events so no two stories play out exactly the same.  After a battle or negotiation there is a draft where you get to pick one of three random cards for your deck, so there is deck-building too.  The characters you encounter are also not always the same, and so you can get different bonuses by making them love you (or different disadvantages from them hating you.)  This makes the game highly replayable.  Where the game failed was its marketing!  I'd actually never heard of it until I saw someone on Facebook ask:  What are your 10 favorite games of all time?  And someone had Griftlands in their answer, and I was like ""WTF is that?  Never heard of it.""  I'm glad I asked. | 进包了补一下我的评测好了，抬头一看我去，我竟然玩了40小时，huh？
将RPG与DBG玩法融合的剧情卡牌游戏，并且二者的占比几乎是64开的一款游戏。三位可选主角，有女主有人外，各自有不同的故事体验，丰富的选择取向和配音满足喜欢看剧情的玩家；两种卡牌对战机制，协商或战斗随机应变，用谈话的方式那就是话疗！（但是协商在最终boss战不起作用这点实在是，一周目疯狂话疗一点没升级战斗打我个措手不及）。
缺点是流程通关后，对比纯DBG来说欺诈之地的游戏过程，操作都显得繁琐，因此重玩性并不是很高。
考虑到游戏整体内容的丰富度，对于50块不到的定价来说确实性价比不错，比较适合轻度卡牌玩家游玩，对中毒卡牌玩家特别是杀戮尖塔佬来说可能会有点无聊了。[b]特别是不喜欢看字只喜欢打牌的，别买，买了又退款你也嫌麻烦，要么给差评游戏也冤枉啊。[/b] | 卡组的构建和两个战斗系统的搭配无疑是失败的，或者说，游戏的这两个核心之处带给我的体验是糟糕的。从世界观、人物塑造和美术等方面来说，这是个很好的胚子，可惜为了强行贴合制作组并不擅长卡组构建，这个胚子被糟蹋了，让人叹息。 | Griftlands is a standout gem in the world of strategy and roguelike games. The writing in the campaign is nothing short of brilliant, with dialogue that brings the characters and world to life. Each interaction feels authentic and contributes to the rich tapestry of the story.

One of the game's most intriguing mechanics is the card system, which involves building two separate decks: one for negotiation and one for combat. This dual-deck system adds a layer of strategic depth, allowing players to navigate the game's challenges in multiple ways. The negotiation deck, in particular, shines as it enables players to resolve conflicts and persuade others with cunning and wit.

However, while the card mechanics are innovative, the viability of combat leaves something to be desired. Choosing to engage in battles often comes with significant consequences, which can sometimes make combat feel like a less appealing option compared to negotiation. This aspect could benefit from some balancing to make combat a more rewarding and viable choice.

Despite this, Griftlands is a captivating experience that masterfully blends storytelling and strategy. Its unique mechanics and compelling narrative make it a must-play for fans of the genre. | 叙事故事和玩法结合的极好，一个剧本适合反复刷"

The levels are just very well crafted to ensure that you may get a lot of value from every playable character, finding solutions to the encounters was super fun and the story itself, while cliché was enjoyable and made me care for the characters. 

It was also suprisingly difficult! But I really enjoyed the type of difficulty the game offers, one where you put in countless attempts at outsmarting a specific encounter, thankfully the quickloads are quick! 

I don't have many gripes at all except for maybe the controls, where very rarely the characters wouldn't go to the specific points I selected, or attempted to go behind pieces of geometry, or got stuck on top of eachother, but it was rare and minor. 

I whole-heartedly recommend this game to anyone which is new to rts games and wants something a bit challenging :) | Очень атмосферная игра, если ты хочешь окунуться с головой в приключения на Диком Западе, то это твой вариант!

There is enough variety to the characters that most puzzles can be approached in a variety of creative ways that will leave you wanting to try again. | 没玩过前作，本作和《影子战术》倒是很像，而且考虑到价格和内容也挺建议从《影子战术》入手。要说画质建模和操作甚至角色技能都看不出区别，只是西部背景所以枪械弹药会放宽一点。
本作有中文配音，但感觉差点意思，还是英配最好。难度的话感觉略有降低，主线16关不看攻略慢慢磨该杀的都杀打了20个小时，DLC也有几关，还有挑战关相同地图但是限制角色，所以内容还是会多一点。

再说两个有意思的：
《影子战术》中的隼人近战是短刀，远程是飞镖，两者互不影响。本作中的库珀近战是短刀，远程是飞刀，飞完之后手上没刀杀不了人，要先把刀捡回来再杀，否则就只能击晕。

However, the game suffers from the passage of time in several key areas. The interface is clunky and lacks adequate scaling options, making it feel dated. Additionally, the mechanics and overall gameplay can feel archaic, and the writing often comes across as amateurish, detracting from the experience.

Graphically, while the visuals are decent, the heavy reuse of assets creates a repetitive feel throughout the game. In isolation, Eschalon might seem acceptable, but when compared to its peers or later titles it inspired, like Balrum or Exiled Kingdoms (which I strongly recommend), it becomes clear that it falls short.

There are certainly commendable ideas present, such as the cartography system and the ability to hide in the dark, which add depth to the gameplay. However, the main plot remains elusive, and the sparse number of NPCs makes the world feel empty and less engaging. Walking across the map can feel long and tiresome, leading to a sense of fatigue rather than adventure.

Ultimately, while Eschalon: Book I has its moments, I find it difficult to recommend it to contemporary players looking for a rich and immersive experience. There are simply too many areas where the game doesn’t hold up against more modern offerings, or older games like Fallout 1 & 2, Wizardry, Ultima etc... | From my child hood time playing this, to the music, and multiple dynamic ways to play this in not strict way.

It is your typical darwin pond game.
Who likes these games knows that it is not so much about constant interaction, but more about watching an ecosystem slowly evolve.

Sadly, because of a lack of complexity, all those games fall short in this regard. Sooner or later you get a stable / stagnant mono-culture and no matter which mass-extinction events you introduce, it stays that way.
With Evolution, this moment comes very early, sometimes even before the 10th generation.
While there is some complexity in the bots behaviour, the game lacks in any other regard.

You can't even save creatures in your pond to lett the ""winners"" compete against each other.
There is absolutely no environmental diversity.
Important evolutionary features like mating for example are missing as well.

Also, other than in the laboratory, you don't have a quick way to play intelligent designer and tweak a creature on the go.
Other than the most basic stats like health and hunger, you have nothing. No save or load, import or export functions, nothing.

I'd like to have a so-so thumb for this. As said, if you look into the quite complex neuronal workings of the bots, this could become a good evolution game but as of now, it just isn't. | I don't really understand the game, but it seems that if you spend time studying the ""gene"" (code in the lab) then you can possibly make great stuff. I'm going to give this one a recommendation, simply because I like the concept and it seems there's a ton of growth room for this game.

But the mechanics behind the game are complex and seem solid, so I'm hopeful that it's going to grow a lot.

Edit: Release version doesn't really warrant a buy. Get this on a discount if you're interested. | Looking forward to seeing where this game goes! It's pretty fun where it's at right now and it clearly has a strong underlying engine so you definitely feel a lot of enjoyment watching your critters grow (especially if you open up your world to play with a couple of friends) | I like the concept of the game, i do. I just think it needs a bit more coding, (I am aware of how hard it is and how long it can take, im so sorry) in the sence of getting it to work well on all computers, and to not have as many 'lag spikes' where it stops for a while. I will be looking to see if any updates come out :) | Let me just start by saying it took me some time before finally deciding to check 'recommend'. 

   It's not a bad game per se, but... well, it's not really a game.

 You start.
 You watch.
You wait.

  Please, if the developer is reading this, PLEASE add a more extensive tutorial. A lot of the negative reviews are as a result of people having no idea as to what to do. It's not user-friendly at all.

 I recommend this because I DO see potential in this game. 
However, I don't recommend buying it right now. IF the developers release some updates and fixes, only then can I offer better input, because no one wants to buy an unfinished project."

Minor Spoilers ahead.

You are a guy who wants to kill Moby Dick. In order to do that, you need to hire a crew, gather money to buy resources and ships, have countless of adventures until you trace the big white and have the power to put a bullet in his eye.
[i]Leveling:[/i]
You can be a Hunter ( which will further specialize in Harpooner - hunting whales or a Fighter - fighting pirates and other enemies), Sailor ( various sailing bonuses and some skills helpful to prevent larger whales from capsizing your boats for example) Craftsman ( cook and can also reroll dices) and Scientist which is the defacto healer.
Furthermore, every man of your crew can have any of the jobs above, and you can also hire cabin boys which doesn't cost resources and can be promoted in any way you want, but it takes longer to level up.

[i] Game Loop [/i]
You buy resources and hire your crew and then you travel the world between various ports, hunt whales, kill pirates, avoid various natural hazards, do quests, sell the blubber, oil and whale meat for a profit, rinse and repeat until you advance through the story long enough and have enough resources to take down Dicky Moe! You have various whale types to hunt, with different skills, drops, hunting locations and migration patterns. You also have a morale system and other small neat features, which most of the time not game changeing, they are fun and can be used for some variety in game.
[i]Ships[/i]
You can improve your ship with various upgrades and also buy bigger ships with more whaling boats. 
One problem i see here is that your crew needs to have certain skills in order to buy a bigger ship and you having limited crew space means you need to fire men and hire other man in order to buy the ship. That is frustrating especially if you raised a cabin boy and now you need to fire it because it doesn't have the needed skills. 
[i] Difficulty and Role Play [/i]
In the beginning and until you understand the mechanics the game can be hard and unforgiving. After you buy your second ship, which has 2 boats, therefore more firepower and a bigger hold you will start to make a big profit and the game starts being too easy ( like many games do). The trick here might be to roleplay a bit and make it harder. You can hire a weaker crew, stop farming whales and just hunt if you encounter one, choose weaker skills and roles. I am doing this in my current playthrough and it's loads of fun, feels quite realistic, always wondering if you will have enough money to buy food or if the next encounter will be your last. 
That doesn't mean danger is not present at every step, fighting enemies is dice based, so there is a big amount a chance involve. One tale smack from a bigger whale while you had bad dice rolls and your game can be , well, game over.
The final boss, Moby Dick, or Dicky Moe how i like to call it , Tom and Jerry reference :P is quite a lot more difficult than normal whales, but with a bit of researching and strategy you can take it down.

Like i said in the TLDR, game is fun and  you can easily sink 50-100 hours into it. Have fun!

It's hard to explain, but Chocobo's Dungeon felt like not only could there have been a lot more to compliment the gameplay loop, but that the overall design was purposefully dumbed down so that the littlest child could enjoy (and they were like ""adults too, I guess.... If you'd like?"")

My Chocobo's Dungeon issues aside: this game is phenomenal if you're looking for this specific kind of gaming itch to have scratched. The Pokemon like collecting and leveling your monster pets is fantastic and there's a lot of focus on true, meaningful progression.

I have 15.8 hours on Steam from way back in 2018 when this released, but keep in mind too that I've also put 50+ hours in on the Nintendo Switch version of this game (due to my Laptop ultimately giving up on letting me play games way back then.)

8.5 out of 10 in my honest opinion. I've yet to play another title in the exact same vein that has done this better.

被画风骗进来的，无语，懒得喷 | I don't know why people think regenerating mobs and roguelikes are compatible, it's a major bug bear for me and it just completely destroys any real roguelike feel a game might have otherwise had and turns it into a bland feeling constant grind. The whole fun with a roguelike is the punishing danger combined with the fact that each area is one and done. Yknow if you manage to take everything out rapidly, that's meant to feel like an achievement and like you're really ahead of the curve, meanwhile if you've fallen behind you get overwhelmed, but if everything is just constantly respawning at a low level rate there is really no magic to anything at all and you find yourself wondering wtf the point is or why you should care.

I'm not going to give this a thumbs down for a preference thing given I don't also think the game itself is terrible or anything, but I just don't think regenerating mobs are good design and I'd rather play something else with more impactful feeling stakes, and I leave this review here as an FYI to anyone who like me can't stand roguelikes with regenerating infinite mobs."

+Gameplay loop is simple and fun. Its a match-3 system similar to games like Huniepop or Candy Crush. The more of the same blocks you match in one turn, the more damage you cause, the quicker you end the battle.
+Graphics are not bad. There's some weird stuff here and there especially on the lips and eyes but generally especially with the backgrounds it looks pretty good.
+Ran without any issues.

+/- The stories are meh. You play as a different character in a different setting for each of the girls. There's like maybe 8 girls or so. Generally speaking while the characters and the stories are not awful they're nothing special either.
+/- Same issue applies to the adult scenes. The scenes are nothing special and while there's some more shocking scenes like a birth scene in which a Cthulhu-esque creature can spawn and destroy the world while some shocking stuff like that exists its just... Not special? It doesn't matter to you because you never managed to get into the story because each girl has a different story and finishing every story takes like maybe half an hour or an hour at most. The characters don't matter to you nor does the story because you don't have the time to get invested into them before the character and the setting changes entirely so you never end up being sad or happy for a girl or for a story. What ends up happening is you read a bunch of text, do the match-3 mini game, below average adult scene, onto the next girl to repeat it all again 8 times.

-Just like any other match-3 game its very luck dependent. You can improve your character by buying stuff from the in game market you earn currency after each battle but that requires grinding an upgrade for example starts off at like 2k for one level and there's like 5-6 levels. On the 3rd or 4th level it goes up to like 12k and you earn less then 3k each battle, even less if you don't win the battle. Items are a lot cheaper which is nice. Still if you get unlucky it can ruin a good run and if you get lucky it can save a bad run but its a lot more annoying then rewarding or punishing.

Besides the gameplay loop and the good enough graphics there isn't much to praise. Even with the gameplay its hard to fuck up a match-3 mini game you know? You get to make some dialogue choices in game but they don't end up doing anything. I read the small info text on each girl so I could make the right dialogue choices which means in the match-3 minigame the girl will cause less damage or have less health etc making the right choice gives small bonuses like that but these bonuses aren't big enough for you to care about it and even if you do what I did read the info boxes and try to understand what the girl is like so you can make the right choice it still doesn't matter because the choices feel so random and disconnected from the girl herself it feels like rolling a dice. It felt so unnecessary that after a while I just started to press one of the two dialogue options without even reading them. If you're looking for adult entertainment there is better, free options out there. If you're looking for adult games there's better both free and paid options out there. If you're looking for match-3 type of gameplay there's better options out there for free, for money, NSFW and SFW. I don't think the game necessarily failed in anything it set out to do its just that it doesn't offer anything special and you can find very similar or even better things elsewhere. | 有补丁都好说，兔子太猥琐了

一些成就：

「就是现在4」：普通宝石就是最普通的，低级宝石是四个连着合的，高级宝石是T型或L型合的，终极宝石是五个连着合的。一开始没弄清楚，去刷一把12个终极宝石去了，搞清楚之后就好刷了

「暴走」：先换几个加怒气的技能，终极宝石技能换成加怒气的。开局终极宝石先不用，多攒怒气搞到快满。再想办法把三个终极宝石连一起可以加很多，实在不行还有个加20怒气的技能。可以刷女神官那关，不会降怒气，还会自己回血，不怕不小心打似。技能还可以带加步数的多拖一会

其他的慢慢摸索就好 | this game is just a mess. from the poorly excecuted scenes to the stupid repercutions of choices.

I was giving this game the benefit of the doubt but at the dragon girl route you can only get a boring ending or a cuckolded ending. what a waste of time this game turned out to be | Call me old fashioned but a tentacle monster having its way with one of the girls, impregnating her and then a baby popping out blood and all is a little off-putting mid fap.

我的力量有人能及啊…


---致我人生第一次玩的卡牌肉鸽神作《杀戮尖塔》
前几日冬促，购买了《杀戮尖塔》这款游戏，在玩之前心里曾想：我玩过那么多个3A大作，怎能会被一个小小的卡牌游戏震撼呢？看着steam好评如潮的评价，心里抱着不理解和尝试的态度，还是打开了游戏。

没错，我摊牌了，我彻底被这个游戏折服，从买完游戏到现在我无时不刻都在玩，目前也差不多一百小时了，如此优秀的游戏玩法和质量已经能超越很多3A大作。

再玩之前，我也确实久仰杀戮尖塔在卡牌肉鸽当中的地位，但是我也确实从来没玩过卡牌肉鸽，《杀戮尖塔》也属于我在肉鸽类游戏中的白月光了吧。确实只有在实际上手之后才能感受到其中的魅力。从最开始的重开在商店里找好遗物，到现在稍微有些对删牌过卡的理解，这种不完全依赖随机而是能够在游戏局内运营、构筑卡牌的机制正是它的魅力所在。同时四个角色特色迥异，相同角色又因为不同的牌组构筑有着不同的打法，再加上几乎毫无门槛的操作，在roguelike游戏的重开-学习的过程中，低挫败感、高成就感、对卡牌的熟悉以及逐渐对角色的理解使得游戏过程不像通常的卡牌roguelike，而更加有趣，能取舍是否该拿牌、是否该移除卡牌、接下来又该怎么构筑，这使该游戏的可重复游玩性大大增加。


前些天终于用战士，猎人和鸡煲把心脏打通关了，也算是对这游戏有些浅薄的理解了

开始玩这游戏的时候，好哥们建议我先玩鸡煲，说是鸡煲转起来特别强，而我也感受到了。

后来哥们和我说，玩战士得学会烧牌，我很诧异，明明每张牌都是我精挑细选的，为什么要把他们烧掉呢？后面理解了，把效率低的卡烧掉后，留下单卡效率最高的卡，打怪效率更高。之后喜欢上了烧牌的感觉，尤其很喜欢腐化，当把其他牌烧干净后，只剩下那几张攻击牌，颇有种破釜沉舟的感觉，就算打不过再sl嘛，把不该烧的牌留下来。

当我研究战士烧牌的时候，我认为战士是一个最需要想象力的职业，玩的时候得靠想象力。

关于杀戮尖塔的赞美太多太多了，我不想去赞美游戏的本身。我印象最深刻的一局是战士第一次打败心脏，因为卡组不太好，强度不高。我腐化黑拥SL一个小时二十次，结局依旧是输。我相信我能赢，我把29张牌牌序列出来，腐化黑拥烧完不同的牌牌序列出来，一个小时后我终于找到了那个解，最后我赢了之后长舒一口气。在那一刻我赢了游戏，在那一刻也赢了时间。或许一个小时我重开一局选牌好早赢了，可是能赢的局我不愿认输。


即使最后我们都会输给时间，这没关系，那也要谱写出每个人自己生命的赞歌。什么是生命的赞歌？或许是藏在人们骨子里的永不屈服、永不妥协、永不认输。

我的人生没办法sl，为了战胜这一路上的小怪，烧过那么多休息牌，娱乐牌，还换了那么多血，这是否真的值得？可惜这个问题的答案没法通过sl去知道了。
现在的我，就想赶快走到下一个篝火休息。人生啊，总是奔向下一个篝火，区别是以前的我会在篝火敲牌，以后我只会休息了。

最后感谢《杀戮尖塔》给我带来一百小时的快乐时光，我现在唯一后悔的就是在大学期末考试期间购买了这款游戏，这游戏真的有瘾啊！😭 | 又开始带鸡煲节奏了我真是服了😅鸡煲是这个游戏唯一的完美职业，已经和尖塔融为一体，成了尖塔的底层逻辑，成名绝技偏差认知给尖塔带来了这个贴吧最经典的话题，创造了尖塔的黄金时代，诋毁鸡煲，你想毁了杀戮尖塔吗？
 | My first 500 hours in Slay the Spire were hours I didn't pay for. 

I was a kid in highschool, broke, there was only 3 characters in the game, Vine was alive and Tiktok had yet to really get a foothold in the world. It was a better time.

And I... sailed the seas. Its not something I'm ashamed of, and if you are down on your luck, still a kid, or just don't feel like jockeying the Steam refund policy to see if you like a game, most game devs would prefer thats how you play their game over buying a copy of dubious origin from a reseller. 

Why even bring this up, you might ask? Well, it was only last year that I realized how much had gone into the game, and that there was a 4th character that I had no clue even existed. And, against my better judgement with regards to my ever disappearing free time, I picked up STS again to try that 4th character. And then I started playing the other characters too. And then I started ascension runs. 

Never in all my days have I encountered such a well crafted deckbuilder. Being singleplayer, STS doesn't care if you find a combo that breaks the game and makes the enemy unable to interact with you. Slay the Spire doesn't try and limit your ceiling, it dares you to go infinite, it [i] wants [/i] you to go infinite. My favorite part of the game is how it encourages offense while putting more than enough wrinkles in your path that you can't just go full zerg rush. Fully indexing into any one thing without accounting for the counters puts you on the path to losing. 

Learning the Watcher, the illusive 4th character I didn't know existed as it got added after I put my 500 [strike] pirated [/strike] pre-purchase hours in has been one of the most enjoyable deckbuilding experiences I've had since... well since I played STS the first time. 

The main thing I was trying to do on the Watcher that was so fun was going infinite. There was a really interesting play pattern you can take where you reset a lot and chop your deck down to like 3 powers and then your 2 card combo that goes until you win. The fun part is that by taking your deck down to so few cards, any enemy that adds cards to your deck in any way is immediately the most threatening thing you could encounter. You also have to make illogical decisions in order to get to infinite. You skip like 90% of cards you are offered, you make sacrifices for some things that would never make sense in a normal run. And that is just ONE way to play the game on one character, completely ignoring everything that comes with ascension runs. 

And all of that is also completely ignoring everything that isn't purely gameplay. The art is amazing, the soundtrack is amazing, the sound DESIGN is amazing, and there has never been a better time to get into Slay the Spire because there is a sequel that looks like its amping up everything about the first game and giving more of what is undeniably one of the grandpappys of indie roguelikes. That would've been a silly statement 10 years ago, but there are so many indie roguelikes now that it can be hard to stand out among them. 

Slay the Spire has stood the test of time and remains at the top of the tower. Play this game, and if you can, uh, pay for it while you're at it... I did. Eventually.

真的有点惊叹于游戏的设计，仅仅四个角色，仅仅三个区域（算上心脏四个）却可以让一个游戏有着如此大的可玩性。看似重复的遭遇和地图，随着局内带来的各种惊喜（多种多样的道具，卡组搭配，药水选择，随机事件等）和精妙的设计（数值的平衡和关卡的平衡）可以说再玩几百个小时都不会觉得腻。而且这还是我没去更深体验其他三个角色和增加可玩性的mod时的想法。

If you like deckbuilding, pve strategy and the like, this is just perfect. If you've got a background in competitive/multiplayer collectable card games, the pve nature of slay the spire enabling you to do some truly unbalanced things will make you ecstatic

If you're thinking of ""why bother getting this game when Slay the Spire 2 is going to come out soon?"", well this is already one of the best games of all time, don't be silly."

You build your base near good resources and then pray one of the bots won't claim those resources away from you.
Because when that happens you have no way of reclaiming them.
Add the fact that this game balances the difficulty by giving the bots higher stats (thus making the bot always pick resources to claim before you) and you get a game where you can loose within first 5 minutes of the game with no way of preventing it nor fighting back.
After you survive your first 5 minutes, next you have to sell resources, hoping that the RNG will decide that the resource that you are producing is going to be worth anything.

76561198192893105,653940,Zafehouse Diaries 2,2.0833333333333335,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",2,"Time I got around to reviewing this game. It's a mostly text based procedural generation survival sim with horror elements. Sort of. It's also got a very 'meh' relationship system which just isn't all that interesting and I don't recommend getting the game if you're looking for that. The best parts about the game are it's management, survival, and horror elements. That and the ability to add custom content which is fairly robust.

As you can see in the screenshots and whatnot, the game has several objects and characters which you can customize. You can make custom occupations and also set up your survivor crew to be almost anything you like.

My biggest lament is that this game didn't bring over the custom locations from the first game which really sucks a lot.

Also the mood the game sets is really great! A very smart use of sound files helps to sell incidents and lets you imagine what's happening. Sometimes I just enjoy playing it and putting it on in the background. Part of me wishes there was a demi-afk mode version of Zafehouse mixed with the management elements, but I don't know if that would really make the game more appealing. Regardless, if you're someone who doesn't need a full VISUAL of everything happening, then this game can be great for your imagination.

But, lets talk about the bad stuff...

The first thing is the relationships. Or should I say the drama. I totally get that in a zombie apocalypse that's lasting a long time you're going to have disagreements with people. But some of these game modes take place over a few short days with your survivors desperately looking for a way out ASAP. In a situation like this, all but the most antagonistic or stupid people are going to fully cooperate with one another. And I don't wanna play a game where I'm helping a buncha idiots survive.

Fortunately you can bypass this with custom content and manipulating the systems gently.

The next issue is that some of the built in survivor occupations are quite useless. Or almost useless. There are a few that I believe have special events (like the Mayor) which could make up for their uselessness, but kind of don't. In game design, a player will tend toward hedging their bets to win OR go for what is most interesting. That means that unless a weak class/occupation/job or whatever is really interesting to balance out their uselessness, then they're not going to get picked.

Well this game doesn't really let you pick. Usually. But you can force custom content which allows you to solve this issue. But it does just kind of feel lame to always resort to 'building a team' rather than 'building a pool of potentially interesting combinations'.

I mention these things because somehow I feel like the survivors, the general central focus of the game, regularly don't feel very interesting. Not to say they don't have moments, but... well that leads into something I DO like about the game. The events.

Zafehouse diaries has several events that can pop up which will give you some decisions. A lot of the time these are just yes or no binaries with potentially good or bad results. However some of the major events are influenced by how well you are taking care of the map and how well you are barricading and whatnot. These events feel way more interesting to the game than the survivor drama. Quite often they can evoke a sense of mystery that always makes me look forward to them.

My favorite one is a reference to a movie/book by Stephen King. And while I hated the ending of that movie, here it's way more interesting and also MAKES a survivor interesting by giving them a debuff that makes your survivor have bad dreams. And sometimes those dreams can cause really bad things to happen. This is definitely more interesting than the drama between survivors and managing their relationships.

I wish the game was a little more like Dead Rising, but instead of one guy, it's your small band of people documenting things, saving interesting people, and having unique events and psychopaths. Zafehouse Diaries really doesn't focus enough on it's own world and worries too much about the people that you're going to give a story for anyway.

But at the end of the day, the game is ultimately something of a survival managment game and it does it pretty well. It's also pretty damn cheap as of this writing (7$ here). So yeah, I'd recommend it."

Laufe dorthin und kehre zurück um wieder zu laufen und dann sammel das und kehre zurück. 99% nichts anderes und das finde ich sehr schade.... wenn es jedenfalls Teleportationen zwischen Lagern gebe oder mehr Möglichkeiten, aber es gibt nur sehr sehr wenige....Leider nicht meins, aber für andere sicherlich ein schönes Spiel | DESOLATE is a first-person survival horror game set on the desolate & mysterious island of Granichny. After a series of failed experiments, the island has become overrun with mutated creatures & strange anomalies. You play as a volunteer tasked with exploring the island, completing missions, & uncovering the secrets behind the disaster. While it offers a tense & atmospheric experience, it's held back by some rough edges & inconsistent gameplay.

The game's atmosphere is one of its strongest points. The island of Granichny is a bleak & unsettling place, with eerie environments & a constant sense of dread. The sound design is also effective, creating a truly immersive & unsettling experience.

The gameplay combines exploration, combat, & survival elements. You'll need to scavenge for resources, craft items, & manage your character's needs, such as hunger, thirst, & sanity. The combat is a mix of melee & ranged weapons, & you'll need to utilize stealth & strategy to survive encounters with the mutated creatures.

One of DESOLATE's interesting features is its focus on cooperative multiplayer. You can team up with other players to explore the island & complete missions together. This can enhance the experience significantly, as you can coordinate your actions & support each other in combat.

However, DESOLATE suffers from some significant flaws. The combat can feel clunky & unsatisfying at times, with unresponsive controls & inconsistent hitboxes. The game also suffers from technical issues, including bugs, glitches, & performance problems. The story, while intriguing, is not particularly well-developed & can be difficult to follow.

**Pros:**

*   Tense & atmospheric environments! 🌲
*   Interesting blend of survival, exploration, & combat! ⚔️
*   Cooperative multiplayer can enhance the experience! 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

**Cons:**

*   Clunky & unsatisfying combat! ⚔️
*   Numerous technical issues, bugs, & glitches! 🐛
*   Weak & difficult-to-follow story! 📖
*   Can be repetitive & grindy! 🔁

**Verdict:** 6/10. DESOLATE has the potential to be a compelling survival horror experience, but it's held back by its clunky combat, technical issues, & weak story. While the atmosphere & cooperative multiplayer can be enjoyable, the game's flaws make it a difficult recommendation for all but the most dedicated fans of the genre. It feels like a missed opportunity that could have been much better with more polish & refinement. 😔

P.s - Ставьте лайки, добавляйтесь в друзья. Спасибо!!! | Next gen update makes the game unplayable without mods and tweaks. No fps limiter for a game with an engine that breaks at high framerates. Ultrawide support is just a waste, disgraceful to stretch the UI to fit. | Esse é um dos meus games favoritos, tem muita gente que diz que o New Vegas é melhor mas sinceramente eu acho o Fallout 4 muito divertido, a com ótimos gráficos para a época que foi lançado. | Rating: 9/10

Fallout 4 (2015) is a massive open-world RPG developed by Bethesda Game Studios, set in a post-apocalyptic Boston. With its deep world-building, intense combat, and endless exploration, it offers hundreds of hours of gameplay. However, it’s not without flaws—a weaker RPG system, outdated visuals, and Bethesda’s signature bugs hold it back from perfection.

What Makes It Great?
🌍 Incredible Open World
The Commonwealth Wasteland is one of the most detailed and atmospheric settings in the Fallout series. From the ruins of Boston to mysterious underground vaults, there’s always something to discover.

🔫 Improved Gunplay & Combat
Unlike previous Fallout games, Fallout 4 has a solid shooting system, making combat feel more fluid and engaging. The V.A.T.S. system returns, allowing you to slow down time and target enemies with precision.

🏗️ Settlement Building
A brand-new feature, settlement building lets you create your own bases, defenses, and communities. While it’s optional, it adds a unique survival aspect to the game.

📜 Rich Lore & Side Quests
From the Brotherhood of Steel to the mysterious Institute, Fallout 4 is packed with factions, memorable NPCs, and hidden stories that keep you hooked. The side quests are often just as engaging as the main storyline.

🎨 Highly Moddable
The modding community has turned Fallout 4 into an endless playground. With visual upgrades, new weapons, custom quests, and complete overhauls, modding extends the game’s lifespan indefinitely.

What Could Be Better?
❌ Weaker RPG Elements
Fallout 4 streamlined dialogue choices, meaning your decisions often feel limited compared to Fallout: New Vegas. The lack of a true karma system also reduces role-playing depth.

❌ Outdated Graphics & Animations
Even at release, the game’s character animations and facial expressions felt dated. The world is well-designed, but textures and models show Bethesda’s aging engine.

❌ Typical Bethesda Bugs
From broken quests to physics glitches, Fallout 4 has the usual Bethesda charm (and frustration). While patches and mods fix many issues, it’s something to expect.

❌ Repetitive Radiant Quests
Some quests, like Minutemen settlement defenses, quickly become tedious and repetitive, making them feel like chores instead of meaningful missions.

Conclusion
Fallout 4 is an immersive, content-rich RPG that delivers an incredible open-world experience. It’s not as deep as New Vegas, but its exploration, combat, and modding potential make it one of the most engaging post-apocalyptic adventures out there.

Rating: 9/10 – A must-play for open-world and RPG fans, despite its flaws! ⚡💀"

The soundtrack and writing both range from good to awesome.
But I think the design and balance are just not fun in the end, and that's not something you can avoid.

First of all, and most importantly: the amount of mindless clicking you have to do is ridiculous. And that's the overwhelming majority of your actual gameplay.
There's no automation or multiple selection; even when you have to manage hundreds of humans, you have to move them one by one. You also have to do this relatively fast, as you can't move humans while paused.
I wouldn't be surprised if this even made the game unplayable for some people, especially with CTS.

There's little to no meta progression in the game, which I didn't expect looking at the Steam page.

The default difficulty is just too high. I will personally do even Hardcore, to have the game 100%, but otherwise the game's difficulty is just not worth for what it offers.
Here I use difficulty for lack of a better word, I mainly mean low chance to win.
When difficulty is offset with progression and/or skill gain, then it can be satisfying. E.g. the overwhelming majority of people won't win Hades or Tainted Grail: Conquest on first try, but there's progression to motivate you. In hardcore games like the old Prince of Persia it feels great to win, because there's skill involved. But in Despotism 3K you rely on random events, and on knowing exactly how to react to those events (to be clear, your reaction is a few clicks at max).
I'm talking about events like ones that either do nothing, or disable one of your 3 crucial facilities for a significant amount of time. The only""skill"" in this game is having already encountered a specific event and knowing exactly which option to choose, it's not exactly satisfying. Nor is the game hard to master, despite what the steam page says.

I don't think any of these issues by themselves would be a problem, but combined they seriously affect gameplay experience, constantly and unavoidably. | El juego tiene una premisa interesante, un pixel art bonito, una buena música y te reta, no es fácil al principio.

El problema que he notado es que al principio al no conocer las opciones aunque divertido se hace difícil, pero una vez que conoces las opciones pierde esa gracia y se hace fácil.

Si tu objetivo es completar los logros el problema que he notado ha sido que se hace tedioso, no difíciles, por ejemplo en el modo difícil dependes totalmente del RNG, no puedes pasarlo si X opciones no te salen desde el principio, y otros logros es de repetir y repetir y repetir...

Es un juego que te da algunas opciones de rejugabilidad, pero le veo un principio y un final pero por el precio que tiene ofrece bastante. | Um joguinho legal pra passar o tempo. É bastante rejogável, porque você fica tentando fazer outras táticas depois que perde. É um game simples. A tipografia(font) pixelizada dificulta um tanto a leitura, mas nada que a torne ilegível.

The puzzles are interesting, although not very difficult for a more experienced programmer. That is not a negative, as your solutions are compared (if you wish so) to the rest of the playerbase and to your friends. This prompts you to optimize the speed and size of your algorithms, which is very fun, although sometimes cheesy.

The world-building is quite immersive and it is inspired by real 90s hacker culture. It is clear the developer has either lived and hacked back in the 90s, or has done their homework very well. As said before, the general motifs and world of EXAPUNKS constitute great inspiration and motivation to contribute and change something about your own community.

Never wished more for a stack than when playing this game tho lol. | Really fun world building, and interesting challenges. | The greatest game ever made.

The aesthetic, the concept, and the idea of hacking with a pseudo-assembly language seemed right up my alley.

However, with the bugs, my experience was frustrating from the start. It completely blocked my progress. The game asked me to input some text from the receipt, but I cannot type anything there. No matter what I tried, I couldn't get past this step, which meant I was stuck before even getting to the actual gameplay.

It's disappointing because I really wanted to enjoy this game, but technical issues like this make it hard to recommend. If a game relies on an input system, it should at least work correctly. Hopefully, the developers address this problem and I’d love to give it another shot."

Overall, a 6/10 which would be probably a 7 or 8 if the quality of life wasn't so miserable at points.

The story is good, putting abusers in their place, but I wish there was less crafting or that the crafting was simplified. It's just exhausting backtracking and crafting 15 items for the one item you need to forward the current quest. | Lovely game. Beautiful graphics, in a stylized way. Cozy feel to it, with lots of small stories that have familiar hints from fairy tales. There's just enough puzzling to it that it is not too easy, but also not difficult enough to really have to strain the logical parts of your brain.

You do need to like gathering though. The game relies on you gathering materials for every step of the story you go through, and will use materials from an ever growing number of areas to complete things. That said though, if you just gather things you come across while moving through areas and through the story, instead of rushing from point A to point B, it's really not all that grindy.

My only regret is that the game is only some 15 hours long, and that there's no real immediate replayability. It's a gaming version of a Disney animated movie, as a grown up you probably don't watch it again immediately, but it is fun to re-watch at some point in the future.

Highly recommend, 9/10 | 伟大的游戏。目前我最喜欢的类推箱子解谜游戏。
传统推箱子解谜在现代游戏逐渐式微的原因我认为是腾挪的反馈不高，关卡也很难做出独特性，一个关卡接一个关卡可能看起来都很相似（不是说设计不出来，而是设计所需要的难度更高——这方面做到极致的目前是Maxwell's puzzling demon）。Baba Is You重视思路而轻腾挪使得每一个关卡都更为有趣，能够表达的内容也更加丰富。 | This is an amazing puzzle game, and the best kind.  It's a very simple idea that allows for incredibly interesting and continually novel interactions among the parts of the game.  The art is simple but cute and each time I solve a puzzle I feel a genuine sense of achievement.  Unlike most puzzle games, the more difficult puzzles aren't made by simply putting more moving parts into the machine and making things complicated, but instead are increasingly clever applications of existing methods and occasional additions of new methods.

The core idea is that each level has rules that are set by simple sentences built out of blocks of text.  BABA IS YOU, for instance, means that the player controls Baba.  If you push any part of that sentence out of the way, it breaks, and you no longer control Baba.  Depending on how you push the text, that could mean you've failed the round or it could mean that now you've got control of a key, or a rock, or something else entirely.  The player has to figure out how to use, or more often change, existing rules in order to reach the winning condition.  It's surprisingly fun and challenging. | Some puzzles are quite challenging, I've already gone through the entire process and possibility in my mind, yet when actually trying to solve the puzzle, I unexpectedly discover the result I haven't anticipated. Sometimes it's like solving a difficult math problem—feeling frustrated during the thought process when no solution seems to appear, but finally solving the problem brings a sense of clarity and a deep sense of accomplishment. | This is a phenomenal game but very hard, I highly recommend playing with a hint page or even two open and not being ashamed to check them most levels later in the game. I've been following the hints on a blog called keyofw which does good subtle hints, then when their hints are too subtle checking a YouTube playlist called ""Baba is you- solutions- walkthrough"" by Alayric, which has allowed me to finish nearly all the levels but still get the joy of figuring things out half the time or more."
76561198192893105,736850,We. The Revolution,0.7,Strategy,1,"An absolutely incredible game, one that deserves far more recognition. The artwork is breathtaking, with a striking, angular style that perfectly captures the turmoil of Revolutionary France. The story is just as remarkable—layered, morally complex, and filled with weighty decisions that make every trial feel like life or death. Alexis Fidèle is a phenomenal (and hot) protagonist, full of nuance and internal conflict, making it easy to get lost in his journey through power, corruption, and justice.

The core gameplay—handling trials, interrogating witnesses, and balancing your relationships with various factions—is deeply immersive. It's one of the best implementations of choice-driven storytelling I’ve seen, blending narrative and mechanics seamlessly. Every verdict carries weight, forcing you to constantly reconsider your morals and strategy. It’s a hidden gem in the world of narrative-driven games.

And yet, despite all of this brilliance, I cannot recommend We. The Revolution.

The game falls apart in Act 3 due to an incredibly frustrating, poorly designed combat system that feels completely disconnected from the rest of the experience. The battles are tedious, imbalanced, and, worst of all, essential to progress. If you fail too many times, you can end up completely soft-locked from reaching the ending, rendering all of your careful decisions meaningless. The lack of an option to bypass or mitigate this makes it a glaring flaw that tarnishes an otherwise masterful game. I brute forced my way due to my love for this game, but alas I could not expect others to suffer the same.

It’s heartbreaking, really. We. The Revolution comes so close to being an unforgettable experience, but Act 3’s combat turns it into an exercise in frustration. If you’re willing to push through—or use external workarounds—you’ll find an incredible story worth experiencing. But as it stands, I can’t wholeheartedly recommend it, no matter how much I want to | Un jeu en demie teinte.

There is a learning curve in the game, what kind of track layouts work and what don't, the best way to buy and adjust trains to get the most growth, etc etc. It does have to be said their is a little jank within the system where the game simply refuses to let you place track despite it looking perfectly good.

This however is worth the price of admission as the more you play and the more you understand the game, the more you will be able to begin the process of using the complexity of the game. For example you can keep adding new rail lines and shipping more goods directly on single trains, but when you use the slightly more complex systems of warehousing to get over the flow of goods this becomes a better experience. I am by no means a master of all this at time of writing but once you get to grip with a mechanic it becomes second nature and the game rewards you for that.

The campaign missions are tough but manageable. To progress you will have to start delving into the functionality of the game rather than doing only the most basic play. This challenge is great if you like that element of gaming, however there is a 'Free Mode' that allows you to sandbox on various maps to create and experiment at the same time. So if you just want to make trains go choo-choo, you're golden.

The game is also quiet stable, and tabbing in and out is something the game lets you do no problem. Graphically, I think Railway Empire straddles the pretty enough vs taxing live very well for this type of game. It's by no means ugly.

火车的问题在于你只能买车头不能买车厢，车厢自动给但最多八节，八节够干啥的我请问了，于是想提升效率就只能疯狂堆车头。最奇葩的是别家都是很正常的设计线路买车分配简单明了，你家是一车一线，最多复制上一条线路，制作组是觉得这样做很方便还是单纯脑子进水我是闹不明白，但和上条一结合后期你就看着几十条线发呆吧，顺带他家编辑线路的UI很清奇的拆成两半扔到了屏幕最左和最右，真TM绝了。
当然这些也不算问题，因为本作提供车辆穿模的连连看模式。有了它你就可以无脑两点之间直线最短顺带忘了复线这回事（游戏复线的教学和提示意外的还行），让游戏类型彻底便乘按按钮的点击放置。但本作为了丰富游玩体验或者说让你有事做加入了太多不必要和琐碎的东西，例如提升车辆性能但有性格克制的雇员、敌对AI和股票等没活硬整的玩意，总之建议选择性无视一些功能并通过修改器开局先给AI干死（私搭乱建还没事嘲讽烦得要死）以获得最佳体验。

剧情讲了下美国铁路史到东西合并为止，不过不失。打完剧情还没腻的话可以找几个喜欢的场景比如稀有的北欧日本玩一下，制作组做了不少当地独有的车辆模型也可以在里面瞅两眼（本作没有百科数据库这类功能）。剧情和场景关卡的问题是任务不仅有时间限制，而且在一个有评分系统的游戏里任务过期不是降评分而是直接失败重来，外加敌对AI和明显的初见杀以及任务特有的超远程脑瘫线路这堆重量级贵物。我反正是饱的没什么闲情逸致去规划路线，能通关就算赢罢。 | Fun and engaging gameplay, challenging scenarios.

The gameplay is fun and really easy to pick up, allowing you a much lighter & quicker character building experience without needing the deep time sink that many games do (though I also enjoy that). The procedural story generation system can occasionally lead to some oddities but all in all makes for a very fun and replayable experience! 

I also love the concept of adventures spanning multiple generations, and characters becoming too old to fight. it adds an element of scale and realism to the adventures that I really appreciate.

PROS:
- I like puzzlers. 
- When better & more distiguishable colors might have been used, could be a nice puzzler.

CONS:
- Sometimes very hard to distiinguish the car & their matching routing point colors on the map.
  => Becomes more of a trial & error game
  => Lots of restartss required
- Some cars can only start when the other cars have done their routes, with the possibility
  that the early cars might have blocked off the intented routes of the late starters.
  => Restarts
- Instructions of the map sometimes very unclear.
  => Restarts

OVERALL:
Skip this game when you have problems determining what colors you are looking at.
It can become very frustrating very soon.

76561198192893105,823910,Last Evil,0.6,"Indie, Strategy",3,"9/10 Strategic, difficult, and fun to play sexual  turn based card game. Just a bit too difficult if you're not experienced and a bit to glossy with the design.

Narrative: You are a lone succubus traveling a multi-leveled dungeon to defeat the demon forces . As you do you will face off against a multitude of enemies ranging from goblins, werewolves, orc, and many many more fantasy races. The story isn't too complex but  has multiple  endings (good and bad) as well as fail states from losing battles so you are incentivized to replay on various routes and difficulties as you experience the gameplay. 

Gameplay:  The game has 3 key functions deck building, interaction based side-effects, and skill tree management. The deck building is the core aspect, it functions as the gameplay in this turn based card game, and has an assortment of ways you can start or structure it. At the start (or run) you get to pick a deck and gain the option to get additional cards through merchants or rng interactions.  The most common deck/card builds will involve bleed damage, buff stacking, or lust damage. It is important to choose a deck building guide in advance because once the game starts you are stuck with it until you finish that run and your deck resets.  Keep in mind the only way to end a run is to start from scratch, lose or 100% complete it. However, you are able to unlock  buffs and perks through the skill tree after each run. The effects can be modified and will stay with you throughout all your runs whether you are on easy, normal, or hard. Just be warned the combat is also the main meat of where the sexual content resides.

H-content : The content ranges from female, male, tentacles, futanari, and bondage that will (mostly) be done to your customizeable succubus . Most of which will be built around domination or subjugation to you or your foes in  scenes. Scenes can occur mid combat (with the right skill used), in victory/defeat sequences, or in special encounters (depending upon your choice) . The scenes all feature sfx and animation but have no voice work whatsoever and are quite glossy model wise. Once you unlock any victory, defeat, or out of combat scene then it will be unlocked and added to the main menu gallery. There are dozens so you will be playing vigorously if you want to unlock them all.

Also even after reading everything I have to say, you will still be left with enough content to discover on your own.

[h2] The beginner player [/h2]
If you just picked up this game there are some very important points to consider before jumping strait into your first run, or rather your first death (which will come rather earlier then later).

(B1) This game is [b]extremely difficult[/b], I really can’t emphasize this enough. You will die a lot and it will often be caused by total bullshit. I once got [url= https://imgur.com/a/ukko-snipe-bfWzzwj]sniped by an Ukko[/url] while in the holy mountain (safe area)... I don’t know how he got there, but that is Noita for you. The earlier you can accept this fact the better. Don’t despair over ""getting Noita’d""!

(B2) Early on you will lose a lot of your HP from [b]random ticks of damage[/b], e.g. stepping on lava, stepping on toxic sludge, catching fire, etc… Luckily there is a very easy fix to all these issues: WATER. Your very first priority in the first level should be finding some water. Also don’t forget to hotkey your water flask (I use my right mouse button since it is that important). While wet you cannot catch on fire, water turns lava into harmless rock, and it turns toxic sludge into more water. So always stay wet and get used to squirting ;)

(B3) Speaking of [b]hotkeys[/b]: You should set up and get used to hotkeys for your first one to three wands and one to two items. Always using those slots for the same purposes e.g. wand 1 = DPS, wand 2 = movement, wand 3 = digging, item 1 = water, item 2 = tablet (you can throw the stone tablets, which one of can always be found right of the first level, before the lava lake, at enemies dealing massive damage), will build muscle memory and reduce at least the chaos that is caused by miss clicking wands / items.

(B4) Are you a [b]greedy person[/b]? Is it really worth losing 20 HP because you jumped into a pool of lava just to get that singular small gold nugget? The obvious answer is: No! Starting out with Noita you might value gold much more than you should. And while yes you need some gold to be able to buy spells / wands at the holy mountain shops, it really stops holding its value rapidly after just a few levels. A good benchmark to keep in mind is to collect >600 gold in level 1, >800 gold in level 2 (which can be very easily done by digging the gold veins found here!), and >1000 gold in level 3. After that point enemies start dropping so much gold that you really don’t need to worry anymore.

(B5) Last tip for the true beginner. If you start your run with either Levitatium (potion that makes you fly up much higher) or any explosive wand that can shoot a little hole in the side of the mountain you spawn in front of, you can actually [b]go up instead of down[/b]! On the top of the mountain you will find the mountain alter, which contains a so called ""orb of true knowledge"" which gives you a +25 max HP boost (first time collecting it unlocks some spell though) and a tablet. Offering this tablet to the gods by throwing it at the alter you get rewarded with about 100 gold. So depending on your starting layout you can start your run with +25 max HP and +100 gold!

[h2] The intermediate player [/h2]
Having played this game for about 10 to 50 hours most players hit the intermediate wall. This is where you kind of understand the basics of the game, but haven’t actually acquired enough skill in any of its systems to consistently leave the first few levels alive. [b]DO NOT DESPAIR![/b] Every player hits this point and if you can push through it, the game will truly open itself to you.

(I1) The main issue now is a well… [b]skill issue[/b]. So what do you do about it? In my opinion the best thing is to focus on is one area at a time. At this point you hopefully minimized the little tick damage from the environment (remember point B2 above about staying hydrated?), so the next big source of damage are the actual enemies. The enemies in this game have ridiculous aim, to the point where if you don’t move they WILL hit you. However, this game is very consistent with its dodging. Basically all attacks have some sort of visual or audio clue when to dodge. For example, the Hiisi shotgunner will always chug his shotgun before shooting. If you get used to flying up or down whenever you hear this sound he will never hit you again.

(I2) Taking about enemies, learn to [b]outplay them[/b]. Many enemies, despite them seeming way too strong for the level they first appear in, have significant weaknesses. Robocop not caring about your spark bolds? Well throw some concentrated mana at him, since he is made from metal, it will make very quick work of him. Satan is haunting you in the Mines? Try showing him a nice little puddle of water... turns out he is allergic! Hiisi CEO spawns a million employees? Just stay directly above or below them and watch how they won’t even try to shoot you.

(I3) Generally speaking this stage is where you absolutely should watch some [b]guides[/b], join the discord and ask for some help, read through some wiki pages etc. Look at the end of this review to find some recommendations I highly suggest you engage with. Please realize that this game is one of those, where you kind of need to look at the wiki while playing. Obviously it gets better the more knowledge you accumulate but at first just keep an eye on there while playing. A good habit is to just pull up the wiki page for whatever new spell / item you find and quickly skim through it.

[b]I CANT PUT MORE CHARACTERS IN MY REVIEW, SO THE REST IS IN THE COMMENTS LOL[/b] | noita，之前在朋友的账号上玩过，当时什么都不懂，死了两百多次，一次都没通关，后来趁着促销买了，兴奋地上手，兴奋地死亡。这个游戏的地图特别大......
故事剧情：
翡翠石板
翡翠石板的文字看不懂的话只需要在它身边待一小会或者拿着石板一小会，但由于翡翠石板上的文字是没有被翻译的，所以你可以去创意工坊找一下那种翻译石板的模组（不过有极大可能影响成就的完成）。
翻译
noita全部的故事剧情都是被隐藏起来的，你可以在很多处地方看得到那些符号。那些是密文。也就是他们的文字。在noita wiki有相应的译码表。那些无处不在的符号，还有那些独特的建筑物，都是noita剧情的一部分。
隐藏密文
有的密文会被隐藏起来，不少是在书、翡翠石板上都是有提示的，需要你自己来解密。而有些密文没有解密的途径，它们需要通过你富有创造力的大脑想出的点子从而付诸的行动来找到。
noita与卡勒瓦拉
noita的不少剧情与芬兰的神话——《卡勒瓦拉》有关系。你可以买下那本书，然后结合译码表，找寻noita中的剧情秘密……
我想，通过自我的发掘而看到了noita世界的神秘，是对于你玩noita的疲惫的身心的一种鼓舞。
视觉画面：
法杖
法杖的外表很大程度上能决定法杖的性能，而法杖的外表也有很不错的欣赏价值。许多法杖都可以画出一条对称轴，那种对称美是很不错的。
法术
单个的法术造成的视觉效果是不足以称得上是美丽的，只有通过尝试，把许多法术组装成一组法术链，释放的时候，你会为此感到高兴，快乐。你也可以学着其他noita优势火力学说的玩家组装出来他们创造出来的法术链，当你释放的那一刻，你也是很激动开心的。
建筑
noita的特殊建筑也有一种美感。举个例子，冥想方块是一个“3D化”物体，而它的内部——冥想房间，试图为玩家打造出一个3D化空间。另一个例子，从世界的整体来看，如果粗略地看，世界中有好几个建筑呈对称。
音乐音效：
背景音乐
每当你进入到一块不同的区域时，该区域的音乐就会播放，我认为，这些背景音乐很契合当时的区域。
音效
把音乐做到与画面契合是第一重要，把音效做到与画面契合是第二重要（因为已经有第一重要了）。怪物的行为都有相对应的音效，而且很明显，其中的攻击音效有利于你避免死亡。因为许多怪物的攻击都有延迟——即攻击前摇。
玩法机制：
毅力
noita是开放世界，你可以打通圣山七层，你也可以向上飞打通天空八层，或者向下穿凿，打通地狱八层。或者，穿越东西，前往那些平行世界，或者，献祭三宝磨，前往新世界+。
创造力
noita最大的玩法就是法术编辑。一套完美的输出用法术链可以让你横行霸道，人挡杀人神挡杀神。而一套快速的行路用法术链可以让你堪比地球公转速度。如果你觉得一个法术很没用，伤害视情况而定，比如石头，但如果你尝试为它组装一套法术链——比如（加速追踪）（石头）。你会知道什么叫快速死亡。
想象力
在noita有不有趣的机制。当你有了意念力踢击这个天赋，你是否会尝试把宝箱带到雪山祭坛那里？或者把翡翠石板带点那里？当你发现了笛子或者康特琴，你是不是想吹一曲？你发现了沙漏或者埋葬之眼，是不是想泼点东西在里面？
优化适配：视情况而定。noita中存在的实体太多，你再强的电脑也会跟老年机一样。
缺点：
如同noita wiki说的，最强大的同时也是最弱的敌人，就是我自己——米纳。
米纳太脆，敌人太强。米纳没有无敌帧。noita是款地图特别大的游戏，主线已经很难完成，支线——种太阳，种暗日，双日交融，解除贪婪诅咒……都需要很长时间。而它的死亡机制就是，死了一切全部重来。除非你已经完成了相对应的任务并看到了结果，否则你还是倒头重来。
像素卡位。这是特别让我感到恶心的。有时候你开路或者打怪，突然不知道怎么回事卡住了，动不了，任由米纳浮空乱举手，特别是在打怪时候，如果你不能迅速拿出黑洞法术或者崩塌法术又或者飞钩、小型传送等等很安全或者比较安全的破坏地形的法术或者移动类法术。等你的只有重开或者乱按WASDF。 | 途中まで慎重に進めてたのに強力な杖を拾ってから急に気が大きくなってその杖の魔法で自爆した

		Yavrularıyla yangından kaçan bir tilkiyi kontrol ediyoruz. Zar zor yangından kurtulup başını sokacak küçük bir yer bulduktan sonra 4 yavrusundan biri kaçırılan bir tilki. Oyun bize bu tilkinin yavrularıyla birlikte 1 ay insanların içine sıçtığı bir ortamda hayatta kalma ve kayıp yavrusunu bulma mücadelesini anlatıyor ve oynatıyor.

		Bir kelime diyalog içermeden duyguların bu kadar size geçmesini sağlayan, içinize taş gibi oturan hikayelere bayılıyorum. Bu gerçekten başka bir sanat.
		
		Tüm oyun döngüsü bir gün daha hem kendimizi hem yavrularımızı hayatta tutmak üzerine. Onlar için yiyecek bulmalı, saldıran yırtıcılardan korumalı, en kötüsü kürkümüzü çalmaya çalışan insanlara karşı hayatta kalmalıyız. Bir yandan da kaçırılan yavrunun kokusunu takip ederek onu bulmaya çalışıyoruz.
		
		Oyun boyunca insanların doğaya, canlılara ne kadar zarar verdiğini çok net şekilde görüyorsunuz. Sözde ismi ""Care"" olan bir şirket, denize atık boşaltıyor, en iyi ürünü sunuyoruz diyen şirket tavuklara, köpeklere işkence ediyor. Tam olarak günümüzdeki insanlık. Bununla birlikte karşılaştığınız çocuklar ise hala saf ve temiz. Size yardım etmeye çalışıyor, yiyecek veriyor.

 | Definitely deserves the award. This is a game made with love, with beautiful scenery and with a poignant soundtrack. The music combined with events in the game makes it truly immersive. The game title and the theme of the game speak truth: Extinction is forever. Cherish the beautiful wildlife you come across in your life, take the time to observe nature and learn about it, it will not be around forever. You are lucky to see those robins, those bilbies, those foxes, those owls, those snakes, those frogs.

Edit: Now that I've finished the game, I definitely see why it got the award. This game had a profound impact on me as an ecologist in training and I recommend it plain and simple. | great game about the survival of a fox family in an hostile environment. 
kinda short but it fits the story and gameplay.
only negative for me is the constant backtracking.
makes you think about nature and our part in it / our connection to animals and our violent behaviour towards most of them. so - good little thought-provoking game which hopefully triggers empathy.. | My poor, aching, environmentalist heart. What a beautiful and meaningful game. It's short, but every minute counts and means something. You won't regret it; I picked it up on sale, but I'd gladly pay full price.

I had no crashing issues that other reviews describe. Not sure if it was patched or if it's hardware specific."
76561198192893105,913740,WORLD OF HORROR,2.933333333333333,"Indie, RPG",0,"Dev disappeared, came back with a publisher and the thinnest of updates to escape Early Access, then disappeared again. Last comms in early 2024, last update in autumn 2023. The game is nowhere near complete in regards to what was shown and promised. | The developer promised in 2024 February to add lots of new free content and there wasn't a single post ever since, dev just dropped merch to get even more monetization off the game and never appeared again

The game itself is great, but the developer abandoned it and it receives no official updates that were promised, the good thing is that the workshop mods work and community can improve the game themselves, but it still annoys that the developer roughly speaking scammed the community | 
I enjoy Lovecraftian horror, Stephen King, and Junji Ito, so I was really hooked by the dense and creepy atmosphere in this game! The visuals and gameplay are truly captivating. I've only completed 20% of the game, but I definitely want to finish it!
It would be great if the achievements were also tracked on Steam, but having them in the game is still good. | Great game, but be warned that updates are rare at this time.

76561198192893105,673880,"Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus",18.766666666666666,Strategy,7,"The game is really good, especially for a 40k game. The writing is nice and gives you decent glimpse into the Mechanicus and some factions within them. The gameplay is solid, it feels less like a strategy game and more like a puzzle to be solved which is pretty fun.

However there are issues, on the intended difficulty the game is very easy. Your Tech Priests quickly become self healing gods that destroy everything. In my entire playthrough of the game I didnt't have a single Tech Priest die, only expendable troops.

Also because it is so easy it feels like theres no reason to ""explore"" the extra rooms in missions. I just beeline to the objective everytime. 

I hope that the second game addresses some of this because it was really fun but it could be better. I'd recommend it on sale. | Очень бюджетная и затянутая аркада.

Первые часов пять играть довольно интересно, приходится действительно над тактикой думать, выбирать кто пойдет на миссию. Но когда открывается минимальный необходимый гир, что происходит часу на 7, кривая сложности резко падает на дно и дальше ты просто катишься катком всё больше разгоняясь. Некроны вообще ничего не могут противопоставить пачке хотя бы из четырех жрецов и случайные ивенты наносят урона больше, чем все стычки с некронами за миссию в совокупности.

Случайные ивенты вообще мем в этой игре, зачастую даже выбора, который бы приводил к нейтральному или положительному исходу в комнатах нет, то есть это просто обвешивание вашей группы дебафами, чтобы вам было хоть немножко посложнее в финальном файте миссии.

Но главная проблема этой игры это тексты, в игре примерно 45 миссий, после и перед каждой из них вас обдают тугой струёй диалогов по типу
Магос Пупа: Нам нужно захватить эту жижу из гробницы ксеносов, магос 
Магос Лупа: Да, магос, мы обязаны изучить её!
Магос Запупа: НЕТ! Это грязные технологии, мы должны их сжечь!
Магос Лупа: Да, магос, все ксеносы умрут, магос!
Магос Пупа: Но писание учит, что всякое знание благо! Значит мы должны всё захватывать и изучать!
Магос Лупа: Да, магос, поиск знаний бесконечный процесс, мы захватим жижу!
Магос Запупа: Я протестую! „рандомная цитата“ Значит мы обязаны уничтожить жижу!
Магос Лупа: Да, магос, вы совершенно правы, магос!

И эта ахинея КАЖДЫЙ раз после и до миссий, по 10-15 реплик. При этом суть почти всех этих диалогов БУКВАЛЬНО как я описал, с поправкой на то, какой магос начинает ныть, про несчастных скитариев ли или про недостаточность снабжения. Сюжета же или лора там 0000,1%, поэтому во второй половине игры уже начинаешь просто скипать весь этот шум.

Вторая половина игры игра вообще жесточайше душит – некроны перестают давать хоть какой-то отпор, карты начинают повторяться, а видов миссий тут вообще только три на всю игру. Лишь сражения с боссами немного радуют и, как слабый свежий ветерок, выручают. Но боссов мало, игра идёт часов 30, а контента в ней часов на 8. | Fantastic visuals

76561198192893105,640820,Pathfinder: Kingmaker — Enhanced Plus Edition,16.283333333333335,"Adventure, RPG",1,"De longe um dos jogos com o sistema mais complexo que já joguei, não é nada amigável para novatos na franquia, tutorial é praticamente inexistente, algumas mecânicas são similares a outros jogos de mesmo gênero aí da pra levar, mas não recomendaria este aqui ser o primeiro RPG a se jogar. O jogo é complicado do início ao fim, porém a imersão é muito boa, possui um plot interessante, personagens bem escritos que participam ativamente da sua jornada. É um jogo tático baseado em RPG de mesa e sua progressão é toda feita em escolhas e rolagens de dados, e sobre as escolhas, são bem impactantes e possuam consequências reais no desenrolar da história. Elas são baseadas no sistema clássico de tendências em RPG, ou seja, além de você poder ser bom, mau ou neutro, existem escolhas mais específicas como Lawful Good, Chaotic Good, Lawful Evil, etc. quanto mais escolhas boas ou ruins você faz, isso desbloqueia diálogos com interações diferentes.

Logo de início o jogo já te pede pra criar seu personagem em uma ficha enorme de algumas páginas com muita coisa pra escolher, da pra ficar perdido ali. São dezenas de classes, as possibilidades de builds são imensas, da pra misturar classes, tem centenas de habilidades, magias e efeitos diferentes. Infinidade de itens e armas e tudo mais que se espera em um RPG deste tipo.

O combate é tempo real com pausas, porém da pra colocar em turnos e jogar de forma praticamente idêntica a jogos como Baldur's Gate 3. Sendo bem sincero o modo em tempo real é ruim, as batalhas viram uma bagunça, você precisa pausar o tempo todo senão fica difícil coordenar os personagens e aí vai tomar infinitos debuffs roubadíssimos e vai morrer sem ver nada, por isso recomendo jogar em turno mesmo. Ao longo do game existem encontros aleatórios no mapa, contra bandidos e inimigos mais fracos e repetidos, neste caso é tranquilo de fazer em tempo real pois normalmente são batalhas bem mais fáceis e rápidas.

Pathfinder Kingmaker é um jogo indie e o primeiro do estúdio, então muita coisa é mais limitada, mas algumas delas me incomodaram bastante, como por exemplo a câmera que não gira, a navegação do jogo é através de um mapa onde você escolhe um destino e entra na área, por conta disso exploração é muito fraca, estas áreas normalmente são bem pequenas. A iluminação do jogo é muito ruim, o seu personagem emana uma luz ao redor dele e todo o resto é escuro, é uma fog que é presente até durante o dia, me incomodou bastante.

Dentro do jogo tem um minigame de gerenciamento de reinos, onde você simula a evolução do seu reino, afinal um dos plots do jogo é você evoluir desde um mercenário até virar um Barão e se tornar Rei daquela região. Você cria e evolui sua cidade, conquista territórios, coloca seus companions para serem seus conselheiros e ministros e delega missões a eles, é basicamente um simulador de cidade medieval. É um sistema legal, em diversos momentos viciei legal em ficar gerenciando as cidades. Porém o time-lapse disto acelera o jogo e te força a executar algumas missões e te coloca tempo pra resolver, isso também é um pouco frustrante..

Pra finalizar, a otimização do jogo também deixa a desejar, alguns mapas tem quedas de frames, e por ser um jogo que não tão recente deveria rodar bem melhor, mas não chega a atrapalhar a experiência. 

É um game extremamente complexo, mas pra quem busca uma aventura que simule a experiência de se jogar um RPG de mesa tá aí uma opção bem fiel. | I wish this game wasn't impossible to play with non-perfect builds on normal mode. Really wanted to like it but the encounters are FUCKED | If you have played the tabletop, dive in and enjoy. If not, know there is a lot to learn and its not friendly to those who don't know at least some of the game's setting, weapons, feats, or magic types. | 好玩又耐玩的游戏。

构筑种类丰富，一步一步变强的体验很好。100多职业任选，装备同样眼花缭乱看不过来。但是引导不如二代，专长没写前置与升级项。

剧情很好，‘时不时会回忆一些深刻剧情。队友剧情也很真实，能看到现实中自己或别人的影子，感慨良多。

即时制清图，回合制打精英以上战斗。我一周目纯回合制打了130h，之后周目有经验了就快了50h就能速杀。

选项很多，一周目非常容易漏道具和支线剧情，然后多周目选不一样的选项真是不一样的体验，有很多不起眼的选择会影响后期剧情发展。真是阵营九宫格的对话选择，让我有种新维加斯的感觉，现代游戏少有这么细节。 | combat drags, story lags. its great in the middle portion but once your party gets going its basically a bunch of chores until the main quest kicks in. the story is great at the beginning and middle and then gets boring. trying to drag myself through the last section of the game right now. i love the characters."
76561198192893105,936960,General Practitioner,2.1,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation",7,"This is a very good game - for a rather specific audience.

The medical side of the game is rather well-done, and will teach you a lot - but some of the medication names, procedures, and standards of care are obviously different from what you would find in North America. All the same, it's a pretty decent way to learn something about medical conditions and common prescription drugs. It has a rather addictive element - speaking as someone who played it until 4:00 am....

The story element is more of a mixed bag; I wasn't very interested in the overall plot, which to be honest got quite confusing for me. On the other hand, there are nowhere near enough opportunities to form relationships, whether based on sex or on friendship. It's possible to end up in a situation where you have exhausted all possible actions for the relationships you do have and have no opportunities to meet anyone else.

There is an element of minor grinding here, as days or weeks can go past with no patient examinations or plot development. It would be nice to have a ""skip until somthing interesting happens"" button rather than sitting through clinic, clinic, home, clinic, clinic, park, clinic, clinic, home.... for days on end with no interactivity at all.

As in real life, there is the potential for you to abuse your authority as a doctor to see attractive women naked. And as in real life, there are consequences for doing so.

I think this game is better than most reviewers are giving it credit for - but only if you're in that niche market of people who are interested in both medicine and erotic visual novels."

补充：实际上直接找到游戏文件夹（STEAM-库-Prismata-右键-属性-游戏文件夹，把steam彻底关闭退出后台，直接运行游戏，不会调用steam，不计时...... | As someone who can only play StarCraft 2 with ~50APM and failed to defend fast pool everytime, I really love Prismata. A very complex and interesting turn based strategy game. Even as a professional mathematician, I find puzzles and matches in this game deep, hard and very exciting. Different from most of the modern card/turn based strategy games, this game has almost no RNG (except the coinflip in the beginning of each match, and randomized advanced units, which are the same for both side), and all information is open to both side, so calculation and prediction play very very important role here.

The learning curve is somehow steep. More or less like a good RTS game, there are things to memorize: common openings, tricks and trades... But luckliy, there are very good articles about these aspects already: google Prismata library. Once you get over the basics, every game becomes very exciting and unique.

That said, this game is not for everyone. It is for those people who like rigorous strategy and calculation, and hate the gamble effect RNG brings. A very unique game, also well polished. And somehow to my surprise, the in game chat and the community is very friendly, helpful and very warmful towards new players. 

 | This game is the absolute pinnacle of turn-based strategy. It is really a surprise I only heard about this game now, a few days after the release on steam, even though the game has existed for over 3 years I heard. And why you definitely SHOULD buy this game? Here are a few examples of my reasons behind my decision to get Prismata:
- I like chess, I've played HS, Gwent, Duel of Champions, Fire Emblem and loads of other different turn based strategy games, but I have never come across anything like Prismata before. The combination of no RNG(apart from coinflip, which has around the same effect as chess) and very complex game mechanics which need to be perfectly executed or you literally can lose instantly, really creates a very competetive and interesting game environment, where you always feel you can improve gameplaywise after any given game.
- Prismata has been made super-indie, by only a couple of people and because of that has a completely different mindset compared to for example Duel of Champions, which is another game I also loved, although it was shut down by Ubisoft. The developers have clearly emphazised how much it means for them to create a no-p2w environment where you don't have to grind for the cards, or anything, although this is not a card game but a resource management game. Completely opposed to for example the ""pay until you are broke"" - method which sounds like to be the monetization option for Valve's newest ""strategy"" game Artifact and many other similar games in 1v1 strategy genre in general.
- The developers have come up with a really clever solution to prevent the game from every getting solved, or repetitive, as the available ""card"" pool for both players is partly randomized every game. And yes for both players means both players have the same options, in every game, negating most balance issues with cards being overpowered or too weak, as you cannot choose what to take with you ingame.
- The lack of deckbuilding was a weird thought for me at first, but it actually is the perfect solution for any game like this. The reason why card games or other strategy games which involve deck building of some kind get tiresome rather quickly, unless new cards are added very often, which has its own issues with balancing and older cards getting useless and price for new players etc. Although I repeat, this is NOT a card game even though it maybe might seem like one when you take a first look at the UI, I feel that comparisons to popular card games work well with this game, as the strategy is in the end somewhat similar, just without the surprise factor of your opponent having a hand you cannot see. When the options are open to inspection for both players, the mindgames really kick in. And as every game is different and you have to figure out a new strategy for every given game, and also look out for what your opponent is doing, the game will never feel stale!
- Since steam release although the success isn't like HS level, I have had no trouble finding opponents when queueing. Also the AI is really challenging and the single player missions are already so difficult that it feels like they have a lot more content than they  actually do, funnily enough. I like the art style of the game even though I have seen many people calling it ""cheap"" or ""mobile like"", but tbh I think for such a small development team the art style is more than good enough, and main plus I'd say every unit at least feels unique and distinct, thanks to the artwork.
- Main positive is the mechanics though, but explaining all those in a single review might take a little too long, but I just say that after turn one, literally anything is possible. The units have cool combos and setting up situations where you will end up ahead in the long run is crucial to winning any game, and the key is WHEN to do things or not.

Negatives:
-Price of the game can feel a bit high (around 21€ for me with the first DLC) but it did feel worth it for me after I played a while. The game will likely be free to play some point but I wouldn't wait for it as the founder edition has some cool bonuses, like letting you unlock the various skins and other cosmetics for the units a lot easier. Talk about supporting a great game!
- The skill ceiling is REALLY HIGH, like yeah this game is not for everyone, it can feel overwhelming without any experience about these kind of strategy games, and it will take a while even for more experienced puzzle solvers like me to get the hang of it. But if you feel like you are up for a challenge, you will get it.
- If you require GWENT level of art, then maybe this game is not for you. | 卡在界面进不去，开加速也不行，希望官方能提供一个解决办法，不止我一个人遇到了。游戏先好评支持了。 | Summary:  Prismata is turn-based Starcraft meets Magic: the Gathering.  It's recommended if you like the resource management and build optimization of Starcraft, but find unit micromanagement frustrating.  Also recommended if you like the tactical gameplay of Magic: the Gathering, but dislike the cost of collecting cards and dislike games being determined by which player draws the right cards.

Pros: 
- Deep and unique strategic gameplay
- All players on an even playing field
- Every game plays out differently
- Excellent, non-cheating AI with a broad range of difficulties
- Rich support for competitive play
- Very affordable

Cons:
- Small, hardcore playerbase
- Sometimes makes me feel dumb
- Skins only obtainable through a microtransaction slot machine

Prismata is one of those rare genre-innovator games for which it is difficult to make direct comparisions to other games, but which is, in retrospect, surprising that something similar hasn't been done before.  The best summary is ""Starcraft, the card game.""

Over the course of a match, you and your opponent will take turns building units by spending resources in exchange for playing cards to form a tableu of units, selecting some units to attack your opponent, and managing your defenses.  However, instead of playing units from a hand of cards, they are built from a card pool which allows all units to be built at any time, provided you have the required resources available.  This unit pool of fifteen to twenty-two units is randomly generated at the start of each match from a library of more than one hundred options, changing the optimal strategy each game, and rewarding the player more able to adapt their own strategy to the available choices.

The units themselves are purchased using five different categories of resources.  At the start of a match, you start with two engineers, which produce energy, and a handful of drones, which produce gold.  (The first player gets six drones, and the second player gets seven.)  You can use energy to produce more drones, and use gold to purchase other units and structures.  These structures produce additional red, green and blue resources, which are further required to buy more advanced units.

Some units are purely economic, others can attack your opponent, others defend against attacks, and some can do both.  Many of the more expensive units have an ability which you can choose to activate once a turn, perhaps spending some resources, perhaps making that unit unavailable to defend, in exchange for some positive effect.  The five categories of resources, the wide variety of units with unique effects, and the attacking and defending phases bring to mind Magic: the Gathering as a gameplay comparison.  However, unlike Magic, the same units are available to both players during the game, and unlike Magic, there is no need to buy card packs in order to get access to units.

Because the only randomness during the match is the selection of units available, and because the same units are available to both players, the winner of a match is determined only by he who makes the best decisions.  This can be very rewarding when you win, but when you lose, there isn't anything to blame but your own poor performance.  This isn't Hearthstone, where you can shift the blame to the random number generator.  This isn't League of Legends, where you can scapegoat your teammates.

The high learning curve of Prismata and lack of random elements means that acquiring the skills required to succeed against other players can be a frustrating experience.  This is particularly the case because the player population is somewhat small, with less than two hundred players online at any given time, and quite hardcore.  If you are the sort of player that is easily frustrated by losing, this may not the game for you.  However, if you respond to a losing streak by trying to analyze your mistakes and attempt to ""git gud"", to put it in the parlance of our subculture, then Prismata will be a rewarding.

The game does provide the tools for improving your performance.  There is a replay system allow you to review your mistakes and do ""what-if"" scenarios to see if different decisions would have led to better results.  You can also spectate top-level players in-game, making the game itself a rich environment to learn from the best.

Mitigating the initially brutal multiplayer experience is a lengthy set of single-player battle training missions.  These missions walk you through available tactics and strategies for effective Prismata play.  You can expect to spend twenty hours or more progressing through the single player content.  Also available is a very capable AI opponent, with many difficulty settings, which should allow anyone to find the right level of challenge.  

Currently, Prismata is available through Steam for $25 USD, and the value for dollar at that price point is very generous.  However, be aware that Prismata will, in the future, be a free-to-play game with microtransactions.  The full gameplay experience will be available for free.  Whales will be on even footing with the completely free-to-play player.

However, skins for your units are acquired through a microtransaction slot machine which seems optimally designed to bilk the potential problem gambler.  A trifecta of exploitation makes this so:  difficult to estimate probabilities, cognitive biases about loss aversion, and an in-game currency creating psychological distance from real-world dollar value.  Of course, these skins are cosmetic only, providing no in-game advantage, so you are free to ignore them entirely.  But the process of acquiring skins does feel a little slimey.  I'd strongly prefer directly spending money on skins, instead.

If you are interested in Prismata, I would recommend buying in at the asking price on Steam, since it does give you extra single player content, but if you are unwilling to pay the asking price and can't wait for the free-to-play roll out, be aware that sometimes streamers on Twitch have keys to give to new players, and apparently there is a Discord where you can ask for a key and get one.  I've also seen the developer give keys to people asking about the game on the Prismata subreddit."

Highly recommended if you are fan of isometric RPGs and Turn based. | Отличная игра. Спокойная, красивая, без лишних сложностей...самое то, чтобы после работы перед сном поиграть пару часиков. | The game is honestly just...not that good? 
I'll preface this by saying I jumped right in at hard difficulty. It's not really challenging, just tedious. 
The story is...nonexistant. Your little mage tonberry ripoff does the ironic metahumor thing that ruins the entire experience. We get it, you're the developer's favorite character. but your ironic 4th wall quips are just not funny. 

They couldn't really figure out how to make levels more challenging so they just have infinitely spawning enemies. 
The game mechanics are questionable and not fully thought out. Here's some examples:

-Your melee guy doesn't get much in terms of armor, meanwhile you can level him up to give allies next to him +1 armor pretty early on. Effectively your support and mage become better at taking hits than the tank itself. For a good while. 
-You have an ability called Guard that will attack anyone getting in range, but this ability requires enemies to be next to the melee guy even if he equips a Halberd. that allows him to attack two squares away. Zero cohesion between skills in this card based system. 
-If you put bows on your support you're throttling yourself since bows have incredibly low damage. The default bow is better than the first bow upgrade because of the armor pen, and you won't see another ranged weapon for a while. Meanwhile every successful mission unlocks a bunch of useless melee weapons. Why would you make your support do damage? because most of her support abilities don't cost resources anyway. And she is far too squishy without the armor upgrade to be in melee. So effectively the game shoehorns how you play the support, and they deliberately make sure you do almost no damage with her if you play how they intend you to play.
-There's a reason why most games of this type are hex based. Square grid layout makes it annoying to spot when enemies are next to you on corners. Going from 6 to 9 possible squares of attacks, attacks of opportunity, on corners, is visually harder to spot and frankly looks janky and terrible
-Speaking of attacks of opportunity: I get that you guys copied the base mechanic from DnD, but you do realize monsters are supposed to only attack *once* per turn right? Watching my guy get clapped because he dared to move around the centipede twice in one turn was hilarious. Unless you have that special disengage skill, your characters become effectively rooted in place.  And because of the 9 possible squares of attacks, the skill is actually way less useful so you need a few of those just to get away from enemies. 

I'd say what the game *actually* is about is clever teleport swap tricks with the mage. Everything else just kinda feels like it enables that. And that by itself is not really fun.

EDIT:
After finishing the game, I'd also like to say it's too short. I have 60 hours played because I left it on overnight a few times. Overall about 35 hours worth of content, spanning across 35 missions, a few of which are straight up non-combat puzzles. You unlock a 4th character fairly late into the game to boot. It doesn't really feel like your characters actually full realize their roles until they'lre about level 6 or 7, at which point the game is kinda close to being done. There's no way to respec either, even after finishing the game. The final boss fight is also...incredibly unfun with the mechanics."

AKABLA YUMYUM GRUMLIES

Honestly, its worth the money. Just beware of the sheerly excessive amount of rather expensive DLCs that may or may not be worth the price. The I can fully recommend the base game, I have NOT evaluated the DLCs as of present. | 地形优势是为敌人设计的，致命失误是只有己方存在的，开局是一定要团在一起吃对面aoe的，自己的范围技能是最多打到2个单位的，自己的后排是一定会被切到的，对面的后排是一定有掩体的，角色的个性是令人无语的，还不能自己组合角色。有的局无论怎么调站位，对面都能直接秒杀我后排，数值真的令人无语，确实开好玩啦 | Ich wünschte, ich könnte zurück in die Zeit gehen und es nochmal spielen ohne dem Wissen, dass ich es gespielt habe oder  einfach immer wieder vergessen es je gespielt zu haben um es dann wieder und wieder zu spielen als wäre es das erste Mal. 

Das sollte jetzt auch eine Referenz auf die Story des Spiels sein, falls es jemand bemerkt hat, vermutlich nicht. Egal, tolles Spiel jedenfalls.  


 | So, I found battles repetitive, inventory/store management is annoying, 50% of the time you waste traveling between points of interest, it's so frustrating. The jokes are kind of primitive, though it feels fresh because not much games do this. Most of the items are quite useless. I don't recommend this game. | The Dungeon of Naheulbeuk: The Amulet of Chaos es un juego de rol táctico por turnos de Artefacts Studio. Tiene todo lo que deseas en un RPG por turnos, agrega ciertas diferencias con algunos de sus elementos de diseño y lo combina todo con un poco de humor loco y personalidades divertidas con las clases míticas de D&D. Cabe destacar que en dificultad normal es un juego muy difícil que no perdona el más mínimo error. En lineas generales, me ha parecido un buen juego."

Десятки проблем и сотнями способов их решении. Самый популярный - залить [b]магмой[/b]. И [u]рабочий[/u].

[b]Первые сотни часов[/b] - это про то, как вообще руководить этой шайкой алкоголиков эльфоненавистников. Если вы привыкли к обычным стратегиям - готовьте [i]заруинить свою задницу[/i], ибо вам предстоит познать капризность этих дармоедов.

Эти ребята готовы гору перекопать, но при [i]условии[/i], что они похавали, побухали, поспали, помолились. Подремал, выпил, закусил, смолвил - и тогда дворф готов на великие подвиги. В иной случай - он может пойти по своим делам, пока не сделает всё, что он сам хочет. С начало потеха - потом дело. И это хорошо. Потому в одном случай, дворфы капризные бездельники, и в случай грамотного менеджера - неудержимая производственная сила, готовая сколотить величайшую из империи.

Помимо самих дворфов со своими личными вкусами и приколами, нужно сразу учитывать одну вещь - мир Dwarf Fortress [b]более[/b] чем живой, хоть и по своему, и живёт своей жизнью. У него своя логика, свой темп и свои законы. Они вам будут казаться немного странными, но их нужно учитывать, что бы понимать простую вещь - по вашу душу могут придти со всех сторон, даже о которых вы не подозревали.

 [*]Злые гоблины, жаждущие ваша богатства
 [*]Некроманты с армии мёртвых, жаждущий вашу жепу для пополнение в свою армию
 [*]Всякие чудища, жаждущие ваши богатства и вашу жепу на корм
 [*]Жители-оборотни или жители-вампиры, что внезапно дадут о себе знать и перебьют ваших рабочих как тузик грелку
[*]Демоны, что откусят вам жопу за слишком глубокий майнерский фистинг
[*]Оно вам надо знать, что ещё жаждет вашей смерти?

Когда же вы овладеете средними навыками дварфаводства, а это не так быстро, как кажется - тогда вы пройдете испытание на терпения и на больную башку, в которой явно тараканы танцуют пьяный пляс. Потому что именно [u]эти качества[/u] вам понадобится дальше - ведь с этого момента, вам доступен неописуемо огромный инструментарии к тому, что бы сотворить любую свою извращённую идею, попутно отбиваясь от всяких напастей самых-самых разных мастей.

И более разгочегариная ваша голова, ака магмавая плавильня - тем на дольше вы здесь останетесь, с осознанием того, что здесь гораздо больше возможностей, чем по началу вы себе представляли и ощущали. Тараканы уже прекращают танцевать хороводы, они уже превращаются в одну органическую машину сотворения сумеречных затеи.

До куча самых разных интересных и неожиданных опасностей. Множества интересных подходов к защите вашей крепости, которая рано или поздно, где-то да даст уязвимость, о которой вы не знали, и сыграет с вами злую шутку. И вы отправитесь экспериментировать ещё больше, с любопытством думая о том, чем же ещё можно пробить неприступную крепость.

Воплотив свои фантазии, сделав неприступную крепость, ознаковившись с большинствами механиками игры, однажды вы сделаете одну штуку - зайдете в мастерскую, и вы надолго пропадёте.

Потому что Dwarf Fortress - крайне легко модифицируется в плане содержимого. И крайне разнообразно. Любые существа, любые цивилизации, любые предметы, культуры, расы, генерация мира и прочее - вы можете изменить Dwarf Fortress до абсолютной неузнаваемости, одним лишь программой Блокнота. А теперь представьте, что творится в Мастерской с такой доступностью и с такой изменяемостью. О да. Да, твою мать, ты [b]прекрасно[/b] понял меня, что за чертовщина там происходит. 

Режим приключения, он же классический рогалик, более скромен, но всё ещё достойный, что бы быть частью Dwarf Fortress. Каждое существо - очень подробно описанное индивидуальное, а тебе не обязательно заниматься поисками смерти с мечом и щитом. Можно заниматься так и тем, что бы создать величайшую реликвию, как ремесленник, написать и петь песни, как истинный бард, или рыскать в изыскании знании и самому их писать, как учёный. Вариации, чем заняться и как заняться - тоже вполне хватает. А если не хватит - ты всегда можешь создать крепость, как будущие препятствие для своего приключенца, с ценной наградой в конце.

[h3] Спасибо за чтение обзора, моё почтение и кружка пива тебе, в книгу обид твоих врагов и да Рок анд Стоун, мой друг![/h3] | Mountains of words have been made by this game, and mountains of words have written about it.  
Dwarf Fortress is a storyteller unto itself, the original titan of generative storytelling, a veritable artifact of the city-builder genre.  The names of its greatest games are famous among those who know, and its difficulty, its detail, its sheer fun, is well know.  
Why, then, would you buy this game?   (Other than, of course, the difficulty of reading ASCII)
Because of the vibe.  Your dwarves will not listen to you, but they will listen to ""Drink and Industry.""  Your adventure may come to horrible ends, but ""Sisters of War"" will echo in taverns and bars in many a land.  Your dwarves will build wonders, grand cities to rival or exceed even that ancient inspiration, Moria.  And you will spend hours reading the tales of these stout alcoholics, whose grim outlooks on life match the absurdity and cruelty of the world they inhabit.  
Strike the earth. | Here's the story of my first fortress:

It was forged in the depths of the earth, carved into the rock by skilled and calloused hands. The dwarves dug tirelessly, creating tunnels, rooms, and grand halls. Water was diverted from an underground river, channeled into wells and cisterns, while forges and furnaces fueled the ambitions of the emerging kingdom. The heart of the fortress became a masterpiece: majestic columns supported carved ceilings, polished stone floors displayed concentric patterns, and temples dedicated to wealth, money, death, and lust took shape.
Aurora was only nineteen when she began mining. From a simple apprentice, she became a skilled miner, carving long tunnels into the depths. Her dedication was absolute, yet her heart longed for a place of retreat. Donor, the god of death, was her deity, and when the temple was completed, she became its acolyte, delighting the faithful with the sound of her lute. Her music echoed through the stone walls, bringing solace to those who paused to pray in the silent temple.
The goblin threat was constant. To defend against it, a long access corridor was built, narrow and flanked by sheer drops dozens of meters deep. At the bottom, a stagnant pool of water awaited any who fell. The passage was filled with pressure traps that triggered lethal falling boulders, while at the end of the corridor, behind a strategic corner, an armed militia awaited any survivors.
The attack came without warning. Two of the best warriors were outside, gathering wood. They saw the goblins and tried to fight, but they were outnumbered. As they were struck down by arrows, the enemy advanced. The corridor’s traps activated, killing only five invaders. The rest dodged the boulders and reached the entrance, cutting down the defending dwarves. Blood soaked the polished stones. One goblin stormed into the infirmary, where wounded dwarves, women, and children rested after the collapse of the grand entrance hall. The massacre was total. No one had time to scream. The base was compromised.
Aurora was in the underground worksites when she heard the first cries of alarm. Fleeing dwarves reached her, terror in their eyes was enough to make her understand. Torn between staying safe and fighting, it was hunger that drove her toward the food storage. She crossed the immense entrance hall, ascended the wide spiral staircase that wound upward for a hundred meters, avoiding the central corridors where the slaughter was still unfolding. The food storage was silent. Barrels and crates remained intact, but a pool of dried blood lay near the door. She ate quickly, then left, determined to help her companions. What she saw stopped her in her tracks: a pile of corpses, mutilated bodies of the elderly and children. An old miner ran aimlessly, an iron pickaxe clutched in his hands, yet without a single drop of blood on its metal. Fear had paralyzed him before he could use it. Tulon, one of the few remaining militia dwarves, stood next to a dying goblin, his axe buried in the enemy’s chest. ""This is the last one,"" he said. But the price had been too high. The fortress was lost. Aurora and Tulon fled toward the underground worksites, determined to seal themselves inside and start anew. Behind them, surviving dwarves ran in desperation. But as they reached the atrium of the new subterranean citadel, they saw the terror etched on the faces of the fugitives. No one dared to go any further.
At the far end of the hall, a pool of black water was silently expanding. The well had failed the moment it was completed, just as the attack began. The underground river, diverted to supply the citadel, was flooding the lower levels. The new kingdom, the refuge, the dream of a fresh start, was about to be submerged.
No one knows what became of Aurora and Tulon. Some say they tried to dig an escape route, others that they walled themselves in the depths, becoming the guardians of a sunken kingdom. Their story is lost among the legends of a world now forgotten.

I have now built a new fortress nearby. I will search for survivors as soon as possible.
I fucking love this game.

但游戏内的我是真几把忍不了，一点都不舍得优化全靠社区制作的工具，就连创意工坊的MOD大部分也都是在优化游戏。自动给指定职位安排指定房间都只能靠社区工具来完成，不然每次有职位的矮人没了你就要去完全手动地去给新上任的矮人分配前任的卧室餐厅办公室，连工坊限制只有技能达到某个范围的人才能使用都要靠社区工具，哦甚至都不能从军队页面直接看士兵的位置，我甚至都他妈看不到这士兵在干什么，你要记住士兵的全名然后手动地去市民总览那里找到这个士兵然后才能查看他的位置，为什么是全名？因为这游戏有家族设计如果只记住姓去找的话就会发现有一堆同姓的矮人，而这还仅仅是狗屎交互里的一小部分，这游戏到处都是明明给个按钮就能解决的问题它就是让你用鼠标来回点半天。人手不想多招，交互不优化，屎山代码也不改，要是免费的我都不说什么，都上steam收费了就只在视觉方面优化一下然后就完事了？这像是“我们缺钱了需要赚钱”吗？更像是“没错这就是人们口中说的那个牛逼到爆的矮人要塞，快交钱”

说难听点，没人逼这俩作者仅靠两个人免费更新20年， 明明可以让游戏付费，明明可以招更多人，明明社区愿意帮忙，但是这俩作者就“nooooo我们不想”然后让DFHACK之类的社区工具给他们擦屁股结果还真把社区感动到了各种“仅靠两个人20年免费更新”狂吹。之后作者之一得了癌症不还是要靠发售付费版赚医疗费，结果付费版还是阉割的，发售两年更新都只是在追赶免费版的进度好让这俩兄弟抛下一款游戏应该有的游戏部分继续去研究他们的故事生成器（顺带一提如果你想更好地去查看所谓的故事还是得靠社区工具），我觉得这就是一种傲慢。所以别期待什么时候这游戏会出官方中文支持了，人家作者都不在乎这些，他们只想做吹得牛逼但就是没人玩的小众精品"

- Every corner is fast paced but methodical. 

- The weapon selection is perfect for the gameplay.
    - Each has their own and use-cases and combos and enemies they're most effective against.
        - Flare and Pitchfork for small groups of zombies
        - Shotgun and Machinegun for suppressing while closing in then blasting.

        - Etc.
    - Each  has an alternate fire that are all super good in their own use-cases (except pitchfork).
    - Each is very satisfying to fire and kill with.

- The level design and presentation is very good.
    - Some levels can be a bit confusing at times though.

- The enemies are memorable and they pressure you and they're fun to engage.
    - As mentioned before, each has their own best weapons/combos based on the situation.
    - They will do unexpected maneuvers every time, making no two encounters the same.
    - Their sprites and audio are addictive to engage.
    - They have unique deaths depending on if they burn, explode, or are shot/stabbed.

- There's something to be said about the fact it's *possible* to no-hit this game.

- There are many, many settings to tailor your game.
    - The input binding system is top-notch. It almost hurts to see how they mastered it so long ago.

- The graphics and art style are hellish and unique, and the game is always presenting new visual assets.

- The cut scenes are from another century but I love watching them.

- There are countless user-made maps you can download online.

I recommend Blood to anybody willing to listen. | Onde estão os 42 levels? Aqui só tem uns 6 do fresh supply + 10 do cryptic passage. | ""An Underrated Gem That Still Holds Up
Blood is a masterclass in first-person shooters, blending intense action, dark humor, and a captivating gothic atmosphere that makes it a standout in the genre. Originally released in the late '90s, it has aged remarkably well, thanks to its timeless gameplay mechanics and an undeniable charm that still resonates with fans of retro FPS titles.

Gameplay
The fast-paced combat is exhilarating, with a diverse arsenal that ranges from a pitchfork to the iconic flare gun. Each weapon feels satisfying to use and encourages creativity in dealing with enemies. The levels are intricately designed, full of secrets, and brimming with personality, making exploration as rewarding as the combat.

Atmosphere and Style
Blood's atmosphere is where it truly shines. The mix of gothic horror, dark humor, and pop culture references creates an experience that's both unsettling and fun. The dynamic sound effects, haunting music, and memorable voice lines from Caleb, the protagonist, make the game immersive and unforgettable.

Graphics and Modern Adaptations
While the original pixelated graphics carry a nostalgic charm, modern updates and mods, like Blood: Fresh Supply, have breathed new life into the game, ensuring it runs smoothly on contemporary systems without losing its essence.

Verdict
Blood is a must-play for fans of classic shooters like Doom or Duke Nukem 3D. It’s a game that rewards skill, exploration, and a love for dark humor. Whether you’re revisiting it as a longtime fan or experiencing it for the first time, Blood promises hours of chaotic, nostalgic fun.

Highly recommended for retro FPS enthusiasts and anyone who appreciates games with character and depth. A true classic!""

This review highlights key aspects of the game in a professional and enthusiastic tone while appealing to its target audience. Let me know if you'd like to refine it further! | I rank this game at #2 of the Build Engine shooters, behind Duke Nukem 3D, and ahead of Shadow Warrior. The game shares a lot of similarities to these games, from the engine and gameplay mechanics, to the tongue-in-cheek tone. 

While the humor from Duke comes primarily from his machismo, and Shadow Warrior relies on good ol' fashioned ""Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips""-style racism, Blood favors an over-the-top ""grimdark"" humor that lampoons your favorite 80's and 90's horror films. Caleb laughs manically as he tosses dynamite (this game's equivalent to the Duke pipe bombs), makes corny jokes, and quotes B movies, much like his steroid-enhanced counterpart. 

The gameplay and level designs feel a lot like what you are used to if you have played most other boomer shooters -- kill all of the enemies while navigating the maze-like level, find the keys, and eventually make your way to a switch at the end. Along the way, you try to find as many secrets as possible as they usually grant you access to life bonuses, powerful weapons, etc. While there's nothing groundbreaking here (all of that ground was broken with Duke), I think the level design is excellent and generally on par with Duke Nukem 3D, and a lot more consistent than Shadow Warrior throughout. 

Long story short, if you like Duke Nukem 3D, Doom, Dark Forces, etc., then there is a 0% chance you will dislike this game. It is essentially Duke Nukem 3D, if Duke had spent his teenage years listening to Marilyn Manson instead of hitting the gym."

[h3] Personal experience: [/h3]
I spent over 5 hours in the game, and I can confidently say that it’s perfect for those looking to unwind and relax. The simplicity and minimalism of the game are top-notch. At first, I was surprised by how such a simple mechanic could be so captivating. Slowly, I started building islands, exploring their potential, and genuinely enjoying the process.
The game is a perfect way to relax. There’s no pressure; you simply build, develop, and enjoy the view. I found the way ecosystems come to life and how the island transforms into a vibrant world incredibly satisfying.
[h3] Pros and cons: [/h3]
[b] Pros: [/b]
[list]
[*] Minimalist style: The visuals are light and pleasant, not overwhelming, yet still visually appealing.
[*] Easy to learn: The gameplay is simple to grasp, but it’s addictive and hard to stop playing.
[*] Calming and atmospheric: Perfect for those who want to relax and disconnect from the world.
[*] Building process: Watching your island grow and develop is a deeply immersive experience.
[/list]
[b] Cons: [/b]
[list]
[*] Limited content: The game can feel a bit repetitive over time, and while it leaves a good impression, you may crave more variety in mechanics.
[*] Lack of challenge: For those who prefer dynamic gameplay, the game might feel too laid-back and lacking in competitive elements.
[*] Short experience: Some players might find the game to be a bit too short and simple after a few hours.

ISLANDERS is an excellent game for those who appreciate a relaxing experience and want a break from intense projects.

[i] I recommend it to anyone who’s looking for a peaceful, laid-back experience without expecting complex mechanics. [/i] | One of the most brilliant games I've played. I've gotten so much play out of this ""casual"" city builder. It can absolutely be a casual game if you want it to be, but if you want to maximize your score then this game is actually quite deep. And it's deep with simple systems, which makes it way more accessible. You place buildings, they get points based on their proximity to other buildings, and you need to score points to unlock the next pack of semi-random buildings. That's it, that's the game. What this does is create a game where you're trying to balance placing buildings in the highest scoring way with your need to score points right now, so that you may unlock the buildings you need to make the highest scoring plays. When you can place anything anywhere, this creates quite a complex puzzle. My only complaint is that some of the high scores on the leaderboard are obviously fake due to a glitch from years ago, and they should really be wiped. | [u][b]ISLANDERS[/b][/u] is a serene and tranquil procedurally-generated, endless, score-based puzzle game which has a city-building theme to it. Although its tagline states that it is ""A minimalist city builder,"" this is slightly misleading because the city-building aspect is moreso an aesthetic rather than a core identity of the gameplay since it doesn't involve resource or population management like the more traditional city-building games and is also less predictable due to the randomness of the maps and some of the building layouts.

Overall, I recommend the game as it is very relaxing to play casually for an hour or two here and there, while simultaneously having just enough depth to satiate score-chasers, and the procedural generation of the maps constantly challenges you to adapt to the random terrain and natural features that you are provided. Although I don't care to compete for high scores, I found that attempting to optimize my cities was unexpectedly fun and especially gratifying after planning the general layout of my city and watching the points come flooding in as my plan came to fruition.

Note: this review is current as of the unnumbered patch released on 23 November 2023 which is the latest update.

[quote][b]S U M M A R Y[/b][/quote]

- The gameplay is very accessible to a wide range of players as it is simple and intuitive enough for casual players, yet also has enough depth to challenge score-chasers, but the game is very minimalistic and offers little to no precision when it comes to building an efficient and aesthetically-pleasing city;
- The replay value is decent and the game is fun when played occasionally in shorter sessions but the core gameplay loop will get repetitive very quickly;
- The graphics are vibrant, almost cartoonish, and are reminiscent of the ""Chibi"" art style;
- The soundtrack is composed of relaxing ambient music with rural-style sound effects to give the feeling of an authentic city; and
- There is no story whatsoever but a casual puzzle game like this doesn't have a need for one.

The game has 38 achievements, most of which will be acquired throughout casual gameplay while a few will require you to go out of your way to set them up but aren't difficult by any means and should take less than 10 hours to achieve; however, the [i]Conqueror[/i] achievement will take at least 30 hours by itself and require you to become very familiar with the mechanics of the game while also planning the general layout of each map before placing any buildings. That being said, it isn't nearly as RNG-dependent as many complaints on the Steam Discussion forums would lead you to believe as you merely have to invest some time into the game to learn it beyond a casual level since the achievement is not a given whatsoever.

[hr][/hr]
[quote][b]R E V I E W[/b][/quote]

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
The gameplay is more akin to a puzzle game rather than a traditional city builder because of its focus on simplicity and minimalism: a map is procedurally-generated, you are given a choice between two random sets of buildings, and your inventory is populated with a number of buildings from the chosen set. Your goal is to place the buildings efficiently in order to receive point bonuses from other types of buildings and meet the point threshold which gives you another choice between two more random sets of buildings. This process repeats itself until you either fail to meet the point threshold, by having no more buildings to place, or meet the threshold which allows you to travel to the next map and restart the gameplay loop, ad infinitum.

As far as casual play is concerned, the game is simple and intuitive enough to get into and occasionally have fun with in small spurts. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for those who like to chase high scores because the game demands absolute precision when placing buildings and planning out your city but offers you very few tools to facilitate this need and the tools that do exist are quite shoddy. For example, there is somewhat of an integrated ""snap-to"" ability but it is finnicky and rarely lines up buildings perfectly with one another which can lead to inefficiencies and cause you to lose points -- and sometimes those few points could be the difference between losing a run altogether or proceeding to the next map.

Sometime between 2019 and 2022, the game was handed over to an entirely new development team and they added the more difficult achievements which require a certain level of precision that the game simply can't offer and this makes the minimalist approach of the game feel almost incongruous with, and somewhat inadequate for, these new achievements (one of which is the infamous [i]Conqueror[/i] achievement). If they had made the existing snapping more accurate, added an option to turn on a grid, or gave you a laser level tool, then the game would be feel much more precise but you can definitely tell the difference between the two development teams' philosophy on achievements.

Another minor gripe that I have with the overly-minimalist approach is that the House, Mansion, and Park buildings also have a variety of different layouts (similar to Tetris blocks) but the next one is randomly chosen for you and can't be changed which is irritating from an efficiency perspective and true city-building aspect but I can't complain too much about it because it fits the minimalist design approach that they were going for.

Nevertheless, I still found it quite fun to learn the more intricate nuances to the game's mechanics and optimize my cities; however, once I figured out the most efficient setup then the most fun part became the planning of the city and playing the actual game for long periods of time became a bit of a chore which is why I think that it's a good game to occasionally have fun with in smaller doses because it gets repetitive very quickly.

The game also has a Sandbox Mode where you can unleash your creative side  with an unlimited supply of all buildings and a Photo Mode where you can take fancy images of said creations using a variety of built-in filters and tools.

[h3]Graphics[/h3]
The graphics are vibrant and almost cartoonish in nature which gives it a very charming look. The buildings are also blocky but in a cute and bubbly sort of way -- if anything, I'd say that its art style actually resembles the popular ""Chibi"" art style because of how cute, minimalistic, and caricature-like the art design is. The second development team also added a number of optional seasonal and holiday themes that you can apply to your game to spruce things up at your whim which is a nice touch.

[h3]Sound[/h3]
The soundtrack is made up of relaxing ambient music with scenic noises such as dogs barking, birds chirping, and other rural sound effects. The music is so modest that I'm not even sure if the audio tracks would count as ""songs"". Much like the graphics, there are a number of optional seasonal and holiday-themed songs that you can enable or disable but I frankly couldn't even tell the difference between any of the songs. All-in-all, it's just a very relaxing soundtrack which I would say resembles white noise to some degree. The sound effects are few and far between but the main one you will hear is placing a building which makes a very satisfying plopping sound.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]
Overall, I recommend the game because you can easily relax to it for an hour and forget about the stressors of life as you get immersed in its soothing audio, charming visuals, and straightforward and leisurely nature. If you're more of a score-chaser then it's surprisingly fun and engaging to plan out your city, optimize the placement of your buildings, and get that feeling of elation as your plan flourishes and you watch your points soar. | ISLANDERS is a beautifully minimalist city-building game that’s perfect for relaxing and flexing your creativity. The simple mechanics focus on strategic placement of buildings, offering a satisfying mix of puzzle and strategy elements. The colorful, procedurally generated islands are gorgeous, and each new map feels like a fresh canvas for your ideas.

While the game doesn’t offer endless depth or complexity, its simplicity is part of its charm. It’s great for short sessions or unwinding after a long day. For its price, it’s an excellent indie gem and a must-play for fans of chill city builders. | Маленькая, но приятная и медитативная. Функционал не большой.

なんか軍隊を指揮したいけどRTSは操作が煩雑だし、HOI4は大局的過ぎだし、という気分のところに刺さりました。

各シナリオ開始時、マップとにらめっこしながら出撃させる兵種を考えるのが楽しいです。

ターン制限あるのが面倒そうと思ってましたが、難易度イージーにすると多少ターン数が増えて(20ターン制限だったら25に)若干余裕を持ってできます。ただまあ慣れてくると結構余ります。

仕様を理解すればするほど「おもしれー」という感想になりました。

尚、当方が色弱のせいかもしれませんが、敵と味方がぱっと見で分かり辛いのが難点です。

総じて丁寧に作られている印象で、軍隊指揮したい欲を満たしてくれるゲームです。 | Schwere Rundentaktik-anspruchsvoll, aber mit Übung motiviert es dauerhaft. Eine Empfehlung für Strategiefans des WW2."

76561198192893105,1084160,Jagged Alliance 3,68.2,"Action, Strategy",11,"First of all, I want to thank the developers for their hard work and dedication to bringing Jagged Alliance 3 to life. It’s clear they had the right intentions, and there are aspects of modernization in the game that I truly appreciate. The updated graphics and the effort to reintroduce beloved mercenaries are noteworthy, and it’s great to see the series revived for a new generation of players.

However, as a long-time fan of the series, I feel that JA3 missed the essence of what made Jagged Alliance 2 so special. The charm wasn’t just in the mechanics; it was in the little things—like the way mercenaries bantered, the thrill of assembling your perfect squad, and the immense satisfaction of surviving a tough firefight. These details made it feel personal and immersive, more than just a tactical game.

With JA3, while the modernization is appreciated, the soul of the series feels diluted. Perhaps this is because the focus leaned more toward surface-level improvements (like graphics and accessibility) rather than capturing the depth and charm that resonated so deeply with players of the earlier titles.

P.S. This is purely my personal opinion, and I respect the hard work that went into making this game. As an old fan of the series, I simply wanted to share my perspective and hope future updates or installments can bridge the gap between nostalgia and innovation. | 太好玩了！最近玩这个超级上头啊！由于我没玩过原作1和2，选雇佣兵不会选，对枪械也不太了解，上来真是两眼一抹黑！战斗机制还好说，有点像xcom，枪械我是真头疼了，都两个矿打下来了，我的兵还在用大威力手枪……中途得了一些AK，我隐隐约约知道这枪应该好使的，然后全员换AK，把华约子弹都打光了又开始全员大威力手枪了……F5和F9键都让我搓出火星子了……后来反复研究攻略我才知道哪些枪好使，而且还得根据子弹穿插着搭配的。后来在拿到大砍刀的一瞬间，一切都变得不一样了……打磨大砍刀，强无敌！
剧情还可以，中规中矩，在非洲小国抢钻矿+揭露雇主公司的阴谋。有些小支线任务和雇佣兵之间的对话还蛮有意思的。打完完美结局后我想了下，合着从始到终都是几伙雇佣兵们在互相打啊！这非洲小国连自己的army都没有的！我服了！很符合我对非洲小国的刻板印象…… | A great game that could have easily been a masterpiece if some changes were made. Highly recommended to people who enjoy games such as Xcom, Fallout (1 & 2), Commandos and Wasteland. | Some games didn't get a MMORPG.   They shouldn't have a MMORPG.  The sequel isn't a money grab.

This is one of those good ol fashioned games in my oponion.   I played JA1 and JA2 on game tap.  Fun stuff. | Gem of a game. 

This channels so many good things from the 90's games (and a few bad things).

The turn based team level combat is best in business for a shooting based game.

The freedom of choice in progression is beautiful and the different mercs spice it up even more. It offers the possibility of discovering things yourself like few games these days do. The bad side of that is that sometimes it offers this possibility on things it should tell you about and sometimes some quests just seem to get bugged (or maybe they would've required some team member you didn't have to work?). Some I did and the game did not register them as done and I'm pretty sure one I didn't do anything for but the game just told me I had done a quest as soon as I entered the area.

But the important thing to understand is that you can compensate for the few issues by simply saving on so many different save slots that if things get whacked you can just go back to an earlier save instead of starting from scratch.

If turn based combat is your cup of tea, I highly recommend this game."

This game's definitely on the complex side - you're juggling heroes, hero abilities, perks, managing your town's economy, defences, picking the right weapons, and trying to survive massive waves of monsters all at once. Sometimes I found myself staring at all my options thinking ""what the heck do I do here?"" But overall, the depth made it more fun for me.

There is a mode called 'Boundless' which is perfect for players like me who don't want to bang their head against the wall with tough RNG and the rogue-like aspect where you're expected to die. It makes your heroes stronger by allowing additional perks on maps and gives you more control over your runs by limiting weapon drops. If you're not super into the whole rogue-lite ""lose everything and start over"" thing, this mode's great. It's like a more chill way to play without losing what makes the game special.

I had a great time with it overall. If you're into tactical games and don't mind a bit of complexity, definitely give this one a shot. Just know that there's a lot to learn at first, but the game gives you ways to make it easier if you want. | I hated this game, then I loved it, then I hated it, then I loved it, I still hate it ... but I love it. 

When I first Launched the game, I was too hasty to judge it (I was in a dark spot with gaming). I hated the UI I hated the overload of info I hated the unclear visuals and was just overall frustrated, then - after calming down - I gave it another shot while changing settings to better appeal to my playstyle and boy was I in for a surprise, this game was absolutely amazing with even amazinger music (made by The Algorithm) a band I already like.
With that being said I feel the game overdoes it a lot with the difficulty and RNG, sometimes regardless of what you do you will fail and a game that takes this long to play and isn’t a simple pick-up-and-play it gets VERY tedious, coupled with some very random upgrades and perks for your heroes that it just loses its appeal fast, what I mean by that is in spite of being a kind of rogue-lite it is not at all easy to pick up and play. 
I almost quit on Elderlicht (the 4th map) because it stopped being fun failing run after run after run getting lame perks with lame weapons and lame heroes and over-tuned elites all at the same time but I pushed through and OH boy was completing this game cathartic, I feel like such a weight lifted off my shoulders. 
If you’re a hardcore masochist and like turn based games then this is a must buy. 
Overall score 8/10 meh story GREAT gameplay but INSANELY amazing soundtrack. Too difficult >.>
` | TL;DR: amazing but with some major caveats!

This game scratched a major itch that has been roughing up my existence since I beat xcom2 for like the 5th time. It hits a lot of the same beats with a super challenging and engaging tactical game paired with a great base-building/hero progression mode. The art is fun, the character development is satisfying, and the loop! .. the loop is super compelling. It's so fun to kill monsters, and then want to improve your characters, and then buy stuff, and then build static defenses, and then want to kill monsters all over again. 

It probably dances ever-so-slightly towards the TOO much decision making side in the base phase -- i often spend MORE time there rather than actually slaying undead. But on the flip side, there are so many lever, options, and decisions to fine tune & get the best out of what you're provided with (randomized level ups, found items, etc.)

I've put in over a hundred hours so this is easily a game i've spent the most time in in the past.. decade? So. it's really good. It's really, really good. I might marry it. No, you marry it. Whatever. Someone should marry it.

However, here are a few minor, minor gripes:
- you kind of find the weapons you like (or are the most strong) and then you stick with that and ignore all the other ones
- the difficulty curve goes up by a pretty big degree at the boss stage. so you can easily lose the whole run (6-10 cycles) because you realise at the end that you're behind the dmg curve, or worse, have the wrong skills developed
- the fights themselves, as fun as the gameplay is, become very same-y, in general the later mechanics are harder but less fun
- oh, one time my save corrupted and couldn't be played anymore. i had to restart from the very beginning. that was crappy.

UPDATE: i just hit the last stage/level and as above, the game continued it's habit of making the 'twists' less and less fun. This time it's a random effect that can one-shot an early hero with NOTHING you can do it about it. The only saving grace (Since you can't save in this game) -- is ALT-F4 to lose all progress on that day or night.. but better than starting the whole stage again. BRUTAL.

sub-note: i realise that as great as this game is, i will never play it again. So 100+ hrs is GREAT value, but i'll never replay this game.. unlike my game-soulmate, xcom. | 开始很有趣,之后越玩越烦,让我烦躁的点就是这是个Roguelite+运营的游戏,人物、属性、天赋、装备掉落、商店全是随机,这会导致你的运营很憋屈,经常处于拼尽全力无法战胜的情况.后面图难度过高,还要不断地刷已通关的地图来解锁各种东西(高级装备开局天赋之类),一条条规则加起来结果就是恶心,玩也玩不爽,还是弃了吧.
游戏是好玩的,但我不喜欢. | Not played anything else quite like it. Turn based tower defence with nice pixel art and an awesome soundtrack. I wont go into details about the gameplay as you can find better sources for that, but theres a good amount of meat there without being unneccesarily complicated if you have some experience in TB games.

Took me 120 hours to beat base game levels on standard difficulty. I spent some time trying out different base building tactics and weapon combos, and Im not the sort to min max but it seems to me every weapon (which gives the heroes their move set and are swappable) is viable on base difficulty, although hand crossbow is OP. Base building is more simple, but theres a few different ways you can go and perks (Omens) you can take to focus on one strategy or another.

Will be watching Ishtar in the future, this was something unique and well thought out that I'll probably come back to.

Anfangs fand ich Not for Broadcast spannend, aber schnell wurde es nur noch frustrierend. 
Die Story-Sequenzen bestehen aus unglaublich viel Text, der Aufbau dessen hat mich so gelangweilt, dass ich keine Lust hatte, den Text überhaupt richtig zu lesen.
Das Gameplay im Studio war anfangs spaßig, wurde aber durch ständige Sabotage (div. unrealistische Szenarios) einfach nur lästig.
Man konnte der Story kaum folgen, weil man zu sehr mit Kameras, Frequenzen und Zensur beschäftigt ist. 
Mit dem Humor konnte ich persönlich auch nichts anfangen (aber das ist ja Geschmackssache).
Vielleicht ist der Story-Modus entspannter, aber dann fehlt für mich persönlich die Herausforderung.
Für mich hat es einfach nicht funktioniert... | 在玩法设计和内容制作上都很有趣，无论是电视节目还是其中一些音乐的成分都能看出有意去模仿真正的电视频道，导播的工作模拟的很好，以至于现在看一些节目会开始关注镜头的切换。不足之处则是有时操作太过手忙脚乱以至于无法专注电视节目和游戏剧情，有些无关紧要的剧情反而又没什么需要操作的东西，以及主角的家人线纯粹是选择题，没有什么提示，也无法给人留下太过深入的印象，主角各种操作对自己的职业未曾造成影响，也给人一种为故事发展而刻意安排的观感。但总体来说和国家晚间新闻度过的几个小时已经能够将主要角色的形象，以及两个政党的荒诞塑造的都还不错，结局时再一次听到熟悉的报幕，居然也感到了一些感动……虽然大概率不会多周目，对我来说这种构思有趣设定新颖的游戏，无论如何很有体验的价值。"

76561198192893105,1157390,King Arthur: Knight's Tale,2.75,"RPG, Strategy",1,"Fun tactical RPG game, leaning more towards RPG than tactics. 

I found the gameplay getting a bit stale by the end once you have recruited all the knights which you like, and unlocked the 3rd (and final) tier of abilities. That being said there is a wide variety of abilities to experiment with and upgrade; different classes each have their own speciality, and each character having a slightly different set of abilities from others of that class. The abilities themselves were fun to use, and you can synergize the abilities of your character with your equipment, and with your other characters. 

There are a few different groups of enemies each with a number of different classes, but you fight so that I found it getting repetitive. It would have been nice for the different enemy types to gain more abilities or mechanical changes throughout the game, eg: undead which you fight from the very beginning to end of the game.

The story is interesting enough and a fun twist on the classic tale and cast of King Arthur. Between each main mission there are side missions you can do, including ones which allow you to recruit new characters, which kept things interesting. There is a small kingdom management portion which allows you to choose what to upgrade to customize some benefits. 

The setup of the game is one where you have many more characters than you can take on each mission, and seems to encourage you to switch them out. If characters take enough damage in a mission they get permanent debuffs which can only be healed by sitting out at least one mission. I don't really enjoy those types of mechanics, but the game wasn't so difficult on hard that it came up much. You can save freely throughout missions so if you want you could certainly avoid that mechanic entirely if you only want to use the same 4 knights the whole game.

There is a morality chart where you will make choices between two options of religion and ruling style, with different unlocks when you reach certain points in each direction. This included the ability to unlock some characters which was great, but I didn't find the other unlocks that interesting of useful. The morality chart will also change a few side missions which was cool

Overall the game is fun and a nice mix of tactics and RPG, but not amazing and gets a bit stale after the first half. 

3.5/5 | Жесткая игра. Тут зачастую надо думать как шахматист - иначе миссию не пройти со сложностью не ниже среднего уровня. 

Я прошёл всё - от компании до режима схватки, все DLC к этой игре. Заняло около 180 часов. Крутые видеоролики к картам, большое количество комбинаций героев к миссиям - можно проходить как душе угодно. Да, некоторые миссии трудные, но нравилось составлять стратегию для прохождения задач. Рекомендую. | Great challenging tactical turn based combat. Story and voice acting are good. Good depth of different team synergies and classes. Enemy variety struggles a bit towards the end of the campaign. Morality system and perma death make the game more engaging. 
Overall great fantasy tactics game. | Хорошая тактика, но разрабы прям переборщили с кол - вом битв и противников, на середине начинаешь прям уставать и игра начинает тебя душить. В целом, если играть небольшими сессиями - то нормально, и только если вы в принципе любите пошаговые тактики | After spending 130 hours on this game, I will say that it has good potential and a few good ideas but unfortunately many things are poorly developed and this overall pushes me to recommend it only when on sale.

The good: the graphics are nice, the music is great and the game system is at least interesting.

The mediocre: the loot system is a bit too ""hit or miss"", the roster of heroes is excessively restrictive.

The negative: the story is written rather badly, and the effect is exacerbated by voice actors who with a couple of exceptions sound terribly amateurish; the heroes' talents are overall not very customizable, especially for those that are obtained in more advanced stages of the game and that have entire unmodifiable sections; the cover system is poorly implemented and in the vast majority of the game it is irrelevant if not entirely absent.

The really bad: the difficulty curve, especially in the transition from the campaign to the end game, is abismally done (at least in hard mode): suddenly you find yourself in rooms full of enemies with insane amounts of hit points and armor, rows and rows of tanks (litterally) that hit like tons of bricks and protect archers and mages in rooms that, as mentioned, have no cover wahtsoever.... and all this while the heroes who until the previous mission managed to eliminate their opponents in a few hits now seem to have become all anemic. This does not make the game challenging, it makes it exhausting and boring."

打了200+小时了，主线剧情才推到第4章。由于一些偶然的契机，突然想来说点什么。

今天是2025年1月15日，我偶然在一款叫“小红书”的APP上面看到一位新来的美国博主分享了一张郊狼(coyote)的照片，这只郊狼正在他的院子里休息。我们中国人基本没见过这种动物，看“郊狼”这个名字会觉得有点吓人，又是闯进了家里，自然是十分好奇，问郊狼会不会咬人之类的问题。这位美国朋友解释说，郊狼一般不会咬人。

作为一名在这款游戏里花了很多时间去捕猎的职业猎人，经验告诉我，当你在野外遇到郊狼的时候它甚至在地图上不会变成红点，不会来攻击你，连马都不会怕它，它只会像其他小动物一样自己逃走。甚至郊狼的英文名里面都没有“wolf”这个词，也许英语母语者都不觉得它是狼吧。

我突然想到，这款游戏就是在这样不知不觉的情况下向我展示了北美大陆的方方面面，包括19世纪末期各种火车站、酒馆以及警察局的样子。我还在这款游戏里学会了德州扑克和骨牌（21点是在《生化危机7》里学会的，什么居然让日本人捷足先登了吗）。不仅如此，我在野外和营地里都能听到有人在哼《Oh, Susanna》，而我自己在现实世界中轻易就能听到某饮料品牌唱着“你爱我，我爱你，xxxx甜蜜蜜”，这甚至形成了一种奇怪的联动。

也许顶级的文化产品就是这个样子吧。当你在现实中见到某种新事物，你会发现“这玩意我在某个游戏中见过”；当你在互联网上见到一个对本地文化族群来说相对陌生的事物，你又发现“这玩意我也在某个游戏里见过了”。这很棒，在如今这个时代，电子游戏可以扮演更多的文化交流的角色。 | Steam kullanıcı listesinde dünyada 7.sıralamaya sahip olan Türk oyuncu topluluğunu görmezden gelip listenin son sıralarında olan İtalya ve İspanya’nın dil desteğini sağlayan ayrımcı oyun firmasını protesto ediyorum | It's a true masterpiece!

From the intro in the snow, to the controls themselves, Rockstar wants you to take it slow. Initially I found everything a bit tedious but by the end of it I was as connected to Arthur Morgan as I've been to any video-game protagonist I've played as prior. This world is drop dead gorgeous. The plot and the voice acting performances left me honestly wondering why video-games cannot be considered for oscars. This is a western, a crime thriller, a Shakesperian tragedy, a comedy, and a historical piece all wrapped up in one.

Im not sure what i expected by the clips and pictures but i didnt think it was just a hide and seek game. Theres hundreds of items in each level and spiders can be hiding on them, you find them and then they go running. Its fine enough, if you grind ammo for guns you may find its not horrible but even then their sporadic movements make hitting them pretty obnoxious. I found myself using the clipboard often which is a two hit kill, they get a speed boost though and go hide somewhere. If youre decent at tracking its not hard to find where they could be and you have a spidar detector anyways if you lose them completely.  I just dont find that too fun. 

The other thing that really just broke me and made me realize just how little fun im having is the objectives and hide and seek items you need to find for them. 

The first level halloween modifier wants you to find 12 candies, and three gems for an objective. 
Found 11 candies pretty easily and two gems just by naturally searching for spiders. Spent ten minutes walking through the house back and forth but cant find the last of either of these objectives. Theres another objective that requires you to light candles, and a drawer unlocks if you complete two but im thinking to myself like.. no thats ridiculous.  An objective is locked behind another objective?? Well i dont have ammo for to light the candles so i have to leave the level and go get some, then come back to do that objective. Well yeah guess im an idiot because one of the items i was looking for was indeed in the drawer that gets unlocked after doing 2 objectives. 

Great. That was so much fun. But now i still have one more item collectible to find and i already spent an absurd amount of time looking but lets keep looking. I spent another fifteen minutes looking under and on top of spaces i could see. Finally make my way back to spawn and hop around and wow what do you know, that last collectible is on top of the curtain hidden in a back corner. Wtf?? On top of the curtain? The game went from Easy to miss to downright absurd hiding spots. Left me with no will or desire to play if thats what the whole game is gonna be. A lot of the levels are big. I dont even want to think about some of the nonsensical hiding spots theyve put stuff in other levels. I didnt feel accomplished or think to myself, ""oh boy that was so fun"". I set my controller down in disbelief and quit the game

Some people might enjoy that but i do not, and can not recommend it


TLDR - I thought it was a zany shoot spiders/ destroy environment kind of game. Its not. Its a hidden object game through and through, but you gotta do those hidden item finds to unlock new stuff.  and the places things are hidden are dumb af | I 100% this game and i have to say it was worth it somethings is a little pesky but honestly a great game and well worth the money | its pretty good under 10 hours long if you are casual. each level can be repeated to collect missed items and they have a few halloween and christmas levels. worth buying on sale | Comprei o jogo

76561198192893105,1184820,Poker Quest: Swords and Spades,35.71666666666667,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",7,"This is a phenomenal, unique, and underrated game that can be replayed endlessly, but you must accept and enjoy it for what it is, rather than comparing it to superficially similar games. The developers perfectly explain this: ""Poker Quest feels a lot like a deck-builder, but is fundamentally very different... [it] contains a vast, novel set of game mechanics that centrally focus on the properties of the playing cards.""

Really it's not a deck builder at all, but a kind of dealer's choice poker game where each (combat) round's format is determined by the enemy you are battling. You don't build a deck, but rather optimize a character, whose skills, stats, and equipment, combined with the enemy's, form the ruleset for these rounds, and thus change dramatically through the course of a run, and between runs. 

Unlike most generic rogue-likes or deck-builders, where choosing skills, equipment, and cards IS the game, and decisions in combat itself are often little more than perfunctory proofs of your build, in Poker Quest your build merely determines the mechanics and parameters of a combinatorially rich card game, which you then have to skillfully compete at by drawing and playing cards using probabilistic principles typical of strategies employed in traditional card games.

If you have no interest or facility with this latter aspect, then you are apt to fail or simply not enjoy the game. For this reason I suspect it will be far more appealing to those interested in poker, bridge, or skat than to the average slay the spire player. 

Playing your hands is the meat of the game, and although you can choose more ""autopilot"" characters and load-outs to reduce the complexity of your choices and speed through battles, this can mean sacrificing opportunities for an edge and exposing yourself to more random losses.

Since heroes and equipment fundamentally alter the rules, rather than simply modifying stats, each character and build feels deeply distinct and uses completely different strategies in a way that stands out from any deck builder or CRPG I've played. And I much prefer the vehicle of standard playing cards for conveying randomness, which has been familiar, tried and true for centuries and across continents, rather than yet another statistical invention of some game developer.

The game can be played as casually or as brutally as you like depending on the mode you select and whether you take a smaller win or ""raise the stakes"" to reach the final boss, and as with any traditional card game, you can occasionally find yourself in situations you just can't win. But I quite enjoy losing and improving at this game, which is to me an essential mark of a good one. | For the record I've played this game waaaaaay more than 7 hours, probably upwards into the high hundreds (I've made it to the Astral with every character) It's an excellent game. I'm really picky... so much so that the only two deck style games that hold up for me are Slay the Spire and this one. To anyone first starting to play this game I recommend going straight into standard run and select classical mode, which is the actual game. When I first started playing there wasn't a lot of info out there so I wasted a little bit of time with the upgrade selection, which certainly makes it a little easier at first, but you don't advance in the game that way (it's kind of pointless aside from perhaps making it easier while you learn, but I recommending learning as you go).

Some new players may dislike this game at first, but you just have to give it a chance to evolve. The difficultly in this game is not unrealistic, which many new players based on the reviews think it is… unless you mean by difficulty, beating the astral level, then yes this game is brutal because I’ve never done it (beating this game with a character is getting to the astral, the astral is more of a bonus). Making it beyond the castle in the astral is a realistic feat that I’ve done a decent number of times, but I’ve only made it to the final boss in the astral/game one time. I may be wasting my time on a character that’s easy to consistently go far, but lacks the possibility of going all the way. 
You accumulate new characters in this game really fast. For me at least, not every character is fun to play.... after having played a bit there are only a handful of characters that I enjoy playing. I believe you get the Ninja 5th and that was the first that I really had a fun time playing. 

There is one element to this game that I'm not sure is a positive or a flaw and that is, there are sooooo many potential variations in this game (not in a run, but in the game), so on a given run you’ll rarely run into them or see them. Whether that be weapons (there are so many weapons, you may only see a weapon once every 100 or more hours and this game is 100% random whereas Slay The Spire of course uses probabilities, however each run you eventually learn has a design to it, so you learn to build your run in a way to nurture the design of a given run). Same thing with the Temple of Aces-Dueces along with the temple of Clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds, odds evens, red, blacks. Of all those the best one is evens, followed by red or blacks and you're not going to see those very often. Same thing with the Wizards Tower which you may not even come across on a run and these are expensive and not always good, but they have the potential to give you a super run if the stars align and those stars align so rarely and if and when they do, it’s usually just partially. There’s a goofy thing in this game where your character falls down and loses 3 hit points which happens maybe once every 50 hours 3 hit points is nothing but it’s so random). I forget what it’s called but you’ll randomly get a frog jump where you can jump to anywhere on the board... this is more common (you’ll probably average one per completed run) but when you get it is very very random and most of the time you won’t use it.  As a near absolute rule, you'll never have enough money in this game. I've had many runs where I've received the double your money twice and I let my money accumulate to over 100 before doing it the first time followed by another one and you'll still feel like a broke bastard who needs more money to upgrade your things. 
One more piece of advice - don't ever waste your time trying to get a perfect kill for 1 point. It's astronomically insignificant in this game (it's nearly as insignificant as voting in a national election), so don't bother unless a perfect kill gets you a gem or something. 

But all in all this game is insanely underrated… it was the only game that fulfilled by Slay The Spire itch and I tried all the recommended ones… and in some ways surpassed it since there are so many probabilities, whereas in Slay The Spire once you get 20 level with your 3 characters… which it’s still fun for a time after that, but eventually you’ve done everything to the nth power, so aside from daily runs my motivation in the game has mostly diminished but it lasted a long time and I’m glad part 2 is coming out. For me my motivation in this game on a given run is trying to build a game that’s going to get me deep and potentially beat the astral. Highly recommended if you like Deck builder games… just give it chance and allow yourself to accumulate some new characters. | If you like roguelike, card-based strategy games, you'll love this. If you don't, you probably won’t. 

The classic game mode can be unforgiving—sometimes the RNG feels brutal, but when the odds swing in your favor, the payoff is incredible.

A lore do game é vasta e muito bem construída, sejam quais forem as motivações do herói e de sua esposa (controlada vez ou outra) é possível entender e até concordar com a linha de raciocínio para o bem ou para o mal. O que mais me interessou é justamente o fato de que os 2 protagonistas podem ter pensamentos diferentes que mudam a relação entre eles bem como o destino no geral. | I love this game, I just want Rowan to completely ignore his wife's existence and devote himself to being with Andras.

✅ Muito bom! | 挺好玩也好看，但只推荐玩前半，到差不多第七章节搓完月之盐体验旋转机制就行了，后面就是重复劳动了。
贤者之石贤者之盐谁搓谁享受，我玩这游戏从没体验过快乐.jpg 反正我搓了，我是抖m。
我不明白明明做了一个装备界面为什么只是展示。除了炼金术机分步解锁没有任何可以更换的设备，从头到尾手动研磨，年轻人的第一款玉兔模拟器。
但是话又说回来真全搓完了每天收收菜打发客人也还行。
感觉负声望体验比正声望好一点，恶人们只是干坏事搞事业，但是好人总是会莫名其妙地有小头控制大头的需求，看得很无语。 | 在2.0版更新之后终于成为一款有点可玩性的游戏了。
天天搓药剂像上班一样难免枯燥，花园和装修功能的加入并不能使上班更有奔头。完全没有探索新的药剂效果和制作贤者之盐的动力，每次打开玩玩就觉得有点浪费生命。
但是同题材依然没有更好的竞品，依然推荐来圆一个炼金术士梦。 | 好玩，看似是炼金模拟器实际是种菜模拟器。如果是像我一样不太能接受长时间重复劳作的建议选最低难度，毕竟和普通难度相比单纯减负节省时间何乐而不为，后两个难度就是挑战自我了，至少我是懒的为附加要求重新调配一遍的，也不是很追求最低利润精益求精的，毕竟是奔着标签的放松来的。

游戏的前景还是相当好的，能种菜能装修，看制作组公告未来还会推出更多配方和材料，一到九章在正常难度下还是相当紧凑好玩的，虽然后面每章东西比较少但是也不太繁琐，属于刚好可以接受的程度，而且探索未知发现新药，同时看出场的联动角色还是很有意思的。但是问题也是有的，后期的正反馈太少了，重复机械化劳作很折磨，至少我是不愿意每天收菜再浇水，每次研磨摇断手，都这么有钱了雇个员工我也愿意，而且这种世界观用魔法自动干活也很合理吧。除此之外庭院升级比较慢，天赋树比较浅显，第十章也不太行，前面几章还是比较紧凑的，第十章作为最终章需要的贤者之石贤者之盐太麻烦了，本身后期就比较枯燥了，看到这么多要专门调配的，于是摆了，不过要是能调配出来显然还是很有成就感的。

但总的来说还是相当好玩的，直接上头熬夜游玩。 | [b]OVERALL RATING[/b]
✔ [u]Nothing more to add – 6/6[/u] ✔
It’s fun, that’s all – 5/6
Interesting – 4/6
Mid – 3/6
To play when bored – 2/6
Not good… - 1/6

[b]GAMEPLAY – 6/6[/b]
It’s simple, yet enjoyable. Perfect for relaxation. Mechanics are easy to understand, discovering new substances, potions and characters it’s addictive. The newest update adds some new elements. Thanks to them, game is „fuller”. 

[b]DIFFICULTY – 1/6[/b]
Very easy. You don’t need to be genius, to understand all game features. Money, points, ingredients – everything is easy to get, especially in the late game. Making potions is simple, after update, even simpler. Only more time consuming substances are two last ones, but all you must have is patience. 

[b]EMOTIONS – 3/6[/b]
Relax, nothing more. Nothing can scare or sadden you. Maybe you can feel some satisfaction. That’s why, neutral rating.

[b]PLOT/DIALOGS – 4/6[/b]
Besically, pieces of individual customers and sellers histories. That’s all. 

[b]CHARACTERS – 5/6[/b]
Overall just repetitive NPCs, but from time to time, recognizable characters are visiting your shop. They look like them and dialogs are refering to their worlds. Sometimes they just look like someone recognizable, or idk, maybe that’s just my imagination – I’m talking about crystal seller, who reminds me of a certain famous, bald, chemistry teacher… suspicious…

[b]GRAPHICS – 6/6[/b]
Medieval style, but in modern way. Pleasant, perfectly matches vibe of this game.

[b]MUSIC – 4/6[/b]
Matches well, but it’s little monotonous. Literally background music, so after a while you stops paying attention to it.

76561198192893105,1221250,NORCO,0.0,"Adventure, Indie",0,"NORCO is a beautifully crafted and immensely aesthetic game that is set in a near future, hyper-capitalist Louisiana that itself is placed within a world that is rapidly collapsing due to climate change. The story follows Kay, a drifter/runaway who returns home to Louisiana following the death of her mother. The story that expands from there covers many themes, most notably it revolves around corporate greed, a dying earth, mystery, religion, grief and that strange sense of loss and uneasiness when you return to your childhood town. 

I am not a big fan of point and click adventures, normally i find them rather mechanically boring. However the writing, art and soundtrack of NORCO were incredible. This game is one of the few games that has (albeit briefly) tickled the itch that has been left within my brain after completing Disco Elysium, a praise I would not throw out lightly. 

Highly recommend this game. Given its length it is something you could easily play through in one sitting or a nice rainy day. 

9/10 | 旁人因为妄想得到那神圣的启示而招致灭亡，但那真正的神选之人却并不那么信仰神的指引。你看着眼前的一切不断跌落、被吸进新奥尔良那注定失败的深渊中。每个去强取豪夺那份信仰的势力都灰飞烟灭，而真正拥有它的你连自己都未必能够救赎。

这部作品不可能让你去发现现实中那浪漫而唯心的美好；你在斩断与现实世界的联系之前的最后那一刻，看到的是无尽的毁灭与绝望。然后，你变成了一个任何人都触不可及的幻象。 | Welcome back to the bayou wanderer.

Immaculate vibes, it's basically cyberpunk True Detective.
The puzzles are quite easy, but if you want the good ending you'll need to really get invested in the world. | NORCO is one hell of an experience. It's point and click, and it's text adventure, and there's minigames too. It's cyberpunk, it's set in an alternate modern day Norco, Lousiana, it has a heavy supernatural undercurrent.  It's about alienation from society, from family, from nature. Grief and regret are strong threads of the story -- the present haunted by regret about things left unsaid and grief for lives with nowhere to go but drugs, cults, or drifting. 

It's also a mystery as Kay unravels what happened to her family. It's often deeply weird and delightfully funny, the humor coming in as much needed relief when the story's weight gets particularly heavy.

I enjoyed the story and characters quite a lot. Every character has a distinct voice and they synergize well, and every one of them feels like they belong in the story. The story is intricate and complicated and left me with enough mystery at the end I'm going to be thinking about it for a long time. I also really enjoyed the setting -- our modern world blended with cyberpunk aspects like androids and true AI made it feel grounded and realistically futuristic.

The classic point and click and text adventure aspects of the gameplay were fine -- I appreciated that item interaction puzzles made sense. However, I found the minigames unappealing and jarring. The Simon Says combat style was... okay, but the reaction-based 'click when the ring overlaps' was often janky and laggy, and the first boat navigation section was irritating enough to distract from the story it was telling. Fortunately, you can set combat to automatic, so you don't have to mess with that if it annoys you.

More frustrating is how you're not able to scroll the text box -- keep a pencil and paper nearby to take notes. If you want to use KB&M you'll have to look up what the controls are because there's no input map for it in-game. I also had a few weird bugs -- suddenly being unable to interact with everything, or the camera not fully zooming out -- but these were easily fixed by saving, exiting, and restarting the game.

Despite the things that frustrated me, overall NORCO was an amazing game with a story that's going to stick with me for a long time, and enough in the way of interesting achivements that I'll enjoy going back to get the ones I missed. | 剧情没啥大的，主打一个看文本，本地化做得非常好，对我电波，喜欢！"

I'm really impressed by the creativity of the dev, and I'll probably replay it from time to time. | 帕箱除了成功的做了一个基于推箱子但少腾挪多使用机制构造且主线关卡简单且循序渐进的游戏以外，也解决了其他递归游戏(比如recursed)中经常出现的“玩家难以记得有多层嵌套情况下当前房间的内外层和其他房间是什么情况”的问题。
玩家既可以 以缩略图的形式直观的看到当前房间中更内一层的房间的情况和在屏幕四周看到更外一层的房间颜色和周围一圈的情况，又可以使用鼠标切换查看更远的层。让玩家无需移动主角位置就可以获取更多的关卡结构信息，解决了玩家需要花额外精力来记忆各个关卡的布局和嵌套关系的问题。
但是我觉得作者其实还可以更进一步。为什么不能允许玩家在调整了视野的缩放和中心点之后，允许玩家保留调整后的视场进行推箱，而不是像现在这样一进行推箱就拉回镜头呢？我觉得如果允许这样做，或许可以更容易的理解一些同时在多个窗口发生的事或者更方便的在推箱的同时观察外一圈更大范围的情况。以便在陷入僵局的时候更好的找到出问题的原因。

最喜欢的关卡：挑战5
最喜欢的桥段：无限退出/无限进入（比无限更远的地方有什么 是我觉得最有特色的机制） | 好玩，非常有创意的推箱子，若干个特殊的机制搭配出巨量富有新意的关卡，每一关都不是很长体感就没有步数70以上的，主线关卡大致只是机制的介绍，挑战难度大一些，已全成就。我尤其喜欢其中多重无限相关的关卡，很有趣，另外无限小用ε好评（。总之强烈推荐 | Fully exploring its mind-bending mechanics, the game kept me engaged without ever becoming too tough.

基本はデッキ構築ローグライク x ターン制ストラテジーで
①敵の位置と攻撃範囲が決定する
②自分のターン、攻撃したり敵の攻撃を喰らわない様に移動/回避/ブロックする
③敵のターン、行動順の早い敵から行動する

の繰り返しですが、デッキ構築ローグライクなので”配られた手札”から最善手を行う必要があります。

ただ、ダメージ/ブロック値が多くても2桁だったり、カードに出来る事が「強化する」「削除する」の２択だったりで複雑な事が少なく、戦闘中も数値に関して考えるのは大体「１桁の足し算引き算」で済むので”数値”より”どう行動するか”をじっくり考えれば良い部分がとても遊びやすくなっています。

BGMやアクション、カメラなどがシンプルながらもかっこよくて没入感があり
マップも「吹き飛ばされると即死な場所」しかギミックが無く分かりやすい中でもバリエーションが多い為に飽きにくく
敵のグラフィックもシンプルながら「アクション映画の敵ってこういう見た目のヤツ居るよな～ｗそうそうこういう攻撃してくるヤツｗ」という”アクション映画感”の強い敵キャラなども相まってとても爽快なゲームです。 | One of the best deckbuilding roguelikes out there, far surpassing ""Slay the Spire"" and ""Menace from the Deep"" in my opinion. This game always has me coming back to it. As a martial artist myself, specifically a Kickboxer, of course the battle isn't realistic. Some move animations don't quite match the real technique. A good example of this is the ""Jab"" card, which looks more like a lead hook. Still, this game is a blast and I love it. 8.5/10.

 | We need to talk about the music.

The trailer above only shows a few songs!

I didn't realize I needed a nightclub fight theme song in my life, but WOW did I. It multiplies the intensity of the action in every encounter by 100. Good job, nearvous_testpilot (the producer). | Very slick combat system. When it works, it works well and is extraordinarily addictive.

Annoyances range from major to minor. The random chance card system coupled with some extremely broken enemy types often leaves you in a no-win situation, especially in later levels. | mauvais. je pensais qu un jeu de réflexion se devait d'être réfléchi, mais au final tout et aléatoire, et ce n'est pas le seul défaut. par exemple, dans la plupart des cas, la meilleure option et de ne choisir aucune carte si celles ci ne sont pas améliorées. ou encore, les boss sont les niveaux les plus faciles si vous parvenez à exploiter les défauts du jeu. ou encore, dans certains cas, terminer le niveau est tout bonnement impossible car vous avez simplement été malchanceux, et dans d'autres cas c'est extrèmement faciale du début à la fin parce que vous avez été chanceux. ou encore, devoir posser rééllement le réflexion est souvent inutile et revient dans la plupart des cas à choisir en finalité l'option la plus simple. le jeu est beaucoup comparé aux échecs mais en réalité ça n'a rien à voir, c'est plus comme jouer aux dés; c'est long, on s'ennuie et le fait de gagner ou de perdre ne dépend que très rarement de vous. fans d'échecs, vous serez déçus à coup sûr."

>ABSOLUTE CINEMA ESSE JOGO | gta4的游戏世界观是所有系列中塑造最成功的一代。
与往届gta系列不同，其他系列基本都有不少的电影大片的场面，尤其是5，例如逆天老崔开飞机撞飞机，大动干戈抢劫联合存储，而本作则是被黑暗与严肃，复仇的氛围所笼罩，除了结局尼克跳飞机，没有电影似的大场面，如果说其他gta主角是在生活，那么尼克就是在夹缝中谋生，阴暗的色调也能说明本作主题与世界观。
游戏内的细节数不胜数，无论是人物刻画还是剧情都很出色。人物之间的对话语音包非常丰富，同一个任务进行两次NPC会说与前文不一样的话，我们也能从中得到更多信息，充实整个世界观，可互动的东西与机制很多，例如网页购买与相亲，与不同人进行娱乐活动，警用电脑查询信息，支持进入的房子很多，有会影响结局的利益抉择。总之，gta系列的核心在gta4上的呈现效果是目前最出色的，其内容丰富之程度，将21世纪初的美国展现的栩栩如生。
Niko的结局是目前gta系列最黑暗，也是最引人深思的结局。把黑帮头子杀了之后，自己又得到了什么？心上人已经死去，只剩下罗曼，虽然眼前危机已经解除，但罪恶的自由城会不断蚕食每一个人，等待着自己的又将是什么，自己又应当何去何从？
接着，这一代的问题也比较突出，第一个就是优化问题，卡顿现象较为严重，60帧跑满都有困难，这或许就是当年gta4销量低的原因之一。其次bug比较多，买饭前停顿，在打电话同时按到功能键会卡死，永远的存档冲突。还有就是任务设计不人性化，死了只能重新开始，这一点要表扬5。但这些并不影响他的本质，gta4还是一款非常优秀的游戏。

Один из самых интереснейших рогаликов, в которые я играл. Здесь прекрасно всё: сюжет, механики, визуальная составляющая и саундтрек, но обо всём по порядку.

[h3]Сюжет[/h3]
Сюжет — по моему мнению, первый козырь игры, который цепляет сходу.
Прежний мир уже не вернуть, но мы помним — помним его части и по пути вспоминаем остальные локации и существ, в том числе и тех, кого мы не очень хотели видеть на дороге. Это завораживает и заставляет играть дальше, узнать мотивацию антагонистов и прочувствовать ощущения главного героя, его скорбь и груз его ответственности. Герой сам не помнит кто он такой, из-за чего и вытекает возможность смены класса. Мы не знаем его увлечений, но чувствуем в его словах... Надежду? Воодушевление? Не знаю.
Я прочёл все описания предметов, карточек и врагов, и могу сказать то, что тут всё продумано. Советую почитать на досуге, ведь это углубляет в мир игры. А ещё там написано всё от лица главного героя, что добавляет интереса к чтению.
[b]10/10[/b]

[h3]Механики[/h3]
Вам никто ничего не объясняет, вы всё должны пробовать на свой страх и риск. Нигде не напишут что за 10 гор/холмов вы резко вспомните ещё и о существовании гоблинов, или же о том, что вампиры не против полакомиться жителями деревни. Это увлекает и забавляет, а также в этот момент вы строите в голове сотни комбинаций с другими картами, которые вы можете применить в своем забеге.
Но комбинаций не очень много, и вы быстро их запомните, а также (по моему мнению) не хватает счётчика ландшафтных карт.
[b]9/10[/b]

[h3]Графика[/h3]
Я люблю пиксель-арты, и здесь всё идеально. Нет ярких цветов, что подобает мрачному сюжету. Очень понравились арты снаряжения и, особенно, боссов, что делает их незабываемыми врагами и примером отличного и продуманного врага. За всю игру мы увидим 2 кат-сцены и они шедевральны. Я даже поделился ими с друзьями, настолько мне они понравились, настолько в них влили душу.
[b]10/10[/b]

[h3]Саундтрек[/h3]
Очень понравился саундтрек в лагере, в первой кат-сцене и в титрах [spoiler]и в босс-файте с Омегой[/spoiler]. Когда его слушаешь, в голове так и возникают образы смерти и неизбежного конца, что очень сильно погружает в атмосферу и без того мрачного сюжета. blinch (автор сего аудио-творения) постарался на славу.
В остальных случаях — музыка просто подходит под стиль игры: не особо затянута, без сильных битов, не запоминается, и ощущается заЦИКЛенной (ba-dum-tss).
[b]9/10[/b]

[h3]Итог[/h3]
Мне очень понравился данный рогалик. После The Binding of Isaac и Enter the Gungeon почувствовал что-то новое и необычное. Советую поиграть в данный шедевр тем, кто либо знаком с рогаликами и ищет точку интереса, либо тем, кто обожает пиксели и читать.
У меня всё. Благодарю Four Quarters за данный инди-шедевр, а вас за прочтение данного обзора.
[h2]10/10[/h2] | 玩的差不多了后觉得这游戏挺可惜的，创意确实很亮眼，当年还被TGA提名过，但是呢制作组并没有深耕的打算导致游戏就像个半成品一样。
1：作为主打肉鸽的游戏可重复游玩性却不如人意，到后期基本上就是无聊的刷，这一点可以说是致命的
2：游戏的自由度太高，而在前期惩罚也太高导致初上手的挫败感很强，新手引导特别不过关
3：到后期输了没感觉，赢了也没感觉，唯一感受到的就是时间流逝
总结的说，制作组愿意深耕的话以上问题都有解决的办法，凭借这个创意说不定可以做出一款里程碑式的作品，可惜他们并不在意，不过话说回来打折后的价格性价比没得说，值得喜欢独立游戏的各位买一个体验一下
 | La verdad es que este juego lo llevo jugando desde que salio, sin embargo lo jugaba pirateado en vieja pc, en cuanto mejore con respecto a pc lo primero que compre fue este juego y no eh parado de jugarlo. | I'd give it a 7/10

I had a lot of fun playing this game on my steamdeck while traveling but I will 100% say this game feels kind of unfinished and poorly balanced. A lot of my enjoyment was derived from trying to figure out how to win on the harder difficulties with each character in spite of the poor balancing. 

It's definitely a neat concept that I havent seen done before and I enjoyed discovering neat combinations of tiles on the map like Village + Vampire Manor = Vampire Town. But I wish there was more of that. There should be dozens and dozens of combinations and interactions, but there's really not. It feels like there's content waiting to be implemented but it just never came. 

It's got some soft ""gambling"" elements in that you can end runs early to cash in your treasure or you can always go for another loop or attempt a boss in an all-or-nothing kind of way. It's fun but frustrating in a not so great way. | Fantastic game and gorgeous visuals, normally not a fan of grindy games, but this feels like you make genuine progress every time you play

Dommage car les Visual Novels inspirés de la Mascarade faisaient déjà preuve de plus de finesse pour présenter progressivement cet univers fictionnel aux néophytes du jeu de rôle papier avec une action suffisamment bien rythmée pour laisser le temps au joueur de digérer cette encyclopédie de l'imaginaire morbide. 

En l’occurrence, là on est plutôt proche de l'indigestion, y compris dans le trop grand nombre de protagoniste pour qu'on s'attache vraiment à qui que ce soit. Le jeu a au moins le mérite d'essayer d'inclure une composante jeu de rôle avec une fiche de personnage dédiée à notre protagoniste mais il est souvent difficile de cerner à quel point nos choix influent sur l'intrigue en cours et davantage que des dilemmes à proprement parler, on se contente de répondre naturellement aux conversations, en espérant que tout se passera bien. Le récit est également assez lourdingue dans sa composante écologique (alors qu'elle prêche plutôt un converti en la matière) au point que la protection de la forêt empiète sur toute considération, y compris juste le devenir de notre personnage et son apprentissage du monde des ténèbres. Bref, mauvaise pioche en ce qui me concerne, même si le contexte d'Europe de l'Est est plutôt intéressant avec les inévitables échos à la seconde guerre mondiale mais traités tout de même de manière assez superficielle.

76561198192893105,1390190,APICO,0.95,"Casual, Simulation",3,"If you love the grind, you'll love the game. I really like the aspect of breeding bees to get different types - not many games out there have this concept that I'm aware of. BUT the grind is terrible. I find myself standing around waiting a lot for my machines to process resources and my bees to make produce, though it might get better if I progress through the game more and unlock better upgrades? Very slow and tedious - almost could be an idler - but very cute and fun! | As a bee biologist, I really wish I could recommend this game, but I can't. There are two main problems that make the game completely unenjoyable: 

1. The main draw of the game and core gameplay loop involves using genetics and Punnett squares (if you remember those from biology). The genetic model is very close to real biology but deviates in how dominant alleles work in game. In real life, dominant alleles are dominant (hence the name). In Apico, the allele from the bee placed on top in the breeder is dominant. This is such a bizarre and pointless game design choice. If you took high school biology, it makes the breeding very confusing. It makes the game useless as an educational resource. And it even makes the in game ""predictor"" device that shows you a Punnett square completely useless. The percentages don't even add up to 100% on the stupid thing!

Ultimately, it's the choice to make the core genetics so close to real life biology but not quite there that makes the gameplay so bad.

2. The game is absurdly, unnecessarily grindy. Imagine a Minecraft crafting table, but you can only craft one item at a time and you have to drag a GUI button back and forth for several seconds to craft each item. Just why? It's like someone played Minecraft and thought, ""How can I make the game grindier and more about the UI and less about the game world?""

Unless you enjoy grind for grind's sake, I highly recommend you do not buy this game. | After almost 30 hours of gameplay, I can safely say that I would definitely recommend this game.
In general, I would say around a 4/5. 
What I love :
- Pixel art
- Discovering new species
- Progressive gameplay, the more you play, the more you unlock
- Feels addicting once you really start looking at the genotypes :P
What I disliked :
- Many glitches throughout the game, had to restart multiple times to fix them
- When hovering over undiscovered species, you can still see the name, which I personally feel ruins the 'discovery' a bit
- I don't have a better idea or any suggestions in mind, but the fact you can go see Dr. Beenjamin to know excatly how to discover new bees feels like a cheat or handicap mode, don't really know how to say it exactly XD
but other than that (from the top of my head), I really recommend it! :) | It is very simple and fun, you can take it as seriously as you want to. | super cute and super chill, bee farming/conservation game.

76561198192893105,1404850,Luck be a Landlord,28.233333333333334,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",79,"[b]I’ve beaten the game all the way up to floor 10, and feel satisfied with this accomplishment up to now. Luck be a Landlord is casual fun, and for a casual price I think that’s pretty awesome. But it’s missing the X factor that makes me think it’s really special.[/b]

This will probably be short since the game itself is very condensed. The premise is… completely nonsensical, but whatever. It took me until my 5th run or so before I even bothered to read the text. It’s irrelevant.

The gameplay is simply two loops, one very miniature, and another bite-sized. You spin the slot machine, earn some amount of money, and you choose to add a symbol to it (or not). After a certain number of spins, you have to pay rent, get an [b]item[/b] (different from a symbol), and then the next rent payment is even higher.

Once you reach a high enough “floor”, you begin receiving essences after some of the rent payments, too. These are, at the risk of being overly simple, like temporary forms of the items, with usually greater (but time-limited) payoffs.

This is everything you do in the game.

The symbols themselves are not the most pleasing things to look at, but the thematic synergies are cute. Dwarves drink beer. With an item they can also smash ore. Billionaires synergize with wine and cheese. Divers collect aquatic type items and give permanently higher payouts after collecting them. It’s cutesy like this.

It also does a very good job at showing you with a little animation and sound effect [i]when the effect happens[/i]. I appreciate that as it’s a relatively common complaint of mine in other roguelike/lite games that these games are opaque.

What prevents me from really loving this one is the stark contrast between a run feeling completely blessed by the gods, and a complete car wreck. And the best way to go about beating the game consistently, is the least satisfying way of doing so.

The best way to go about beating the game is just simply to take whatever symbol and item best synergizes with what you have going on in your slot machine already. What this means is that playing best often means two things:

[b]1)[/b] You finish with a hodge-podge of different good symbols and items, without a unifying theme and identity.

[b]2)[/b] There’s not much looking forward to anything or building toward something.

Some runs you [i]will[/i] pick every club, spade, heart, and diamond, and you will be blessed by like 2 jokers to perfectly tie it together. But nothing you did before that moment you received the jokers helped you get them. Sometimes you’ll take every aquatic item there is, and then snag a diver who after a few rolls is already giving you 12 per spin. But again, nothing you did before that moment helped you snag the diver.

More often than not, building toward a specific synergy will result in a loss because you never get the payoff. And why would you take the payoff before you built up the base?

My personal recommendation for the game would be to have a system similar to the boons in [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/]Hades[/url]. In Hades you need certain boons before you can earn others. They don’t [b]increase[/b] your odds at getting the boon, but there is a level of satisfaction to knowing you’re building toward your goal, so to speak. And I think Luck Be a Landlord would benefit from this, even if it meant the game’s difficulty had to be increased in conjunction.

It’s not about difficulty as much as it is about satisfaction.

The other limiters are things like a collection log, a list of run modifiers to toggle, among other things. There [u]is[/u] a Steam Workshop, which I will readily admit I’ve yet to explore, but I will later. And maybe these things can be found there. In all likelihood they do exist there. And without developer effort, the workshop wouldn’t be there, and easy to use, so despite the fact the developer didn’t make the mods, they provided the framework. That deserves credit.

Ultimately though, Luck be a Landlord is limited by its core build philosophy. It’s a fine game, and has a good feel of low stakes. The price point is low, and the gameplay is simple and cute. But it’s not one I’ll really remember or recommend above many other games, although the very affordable price on sales is noteworthy!

[b]6.5/10[b] | I have been playing this for far longer than I was expecting to, and I'm about to boot it up once again. A simple roguelike, but a very well-designed one. Also, based anti-landlord and anti-capitalist politics. | Picked this game up after ProZD recommended it. It's a fun, simple deck building style game where you manipulate a slot machine. Plays well on Steam Deck. | ""У цієї гри - надзвичайно гарні відгуки. Та й тематика ігрового автомату + роуґ-лайк виглядає заманливо. Тож я вирішив спробувати. Перші враження були доволі негативними, бо це не стільки гра про ігровий автомат, скільки """"оптимізатор інтентаря"""". 

Існує велика кількість об'єктів, яка має свої властивості. Наприклад, молоко дає 1 монетку, яблуко дає 3 монетки тощо. Також існують об'єкти, які мають певну синергію між собою. Наприклад, котик дає 1 монетку, але якщо поруч з ним знаходиться молоко, то воно щезає, а гравець отримує 10 монеток. Спочатку нам дають 5 спінів і задачу заробити 25 монет. Потім - 5 спінів і задачу заробити 10 монет. І так далі до 777 монет. Після кожного спіна ми вибираємо один з трьох випадкових об'єктів. А після виконаної задачі ще отримуємо якийсь бонус. Наприклад """"Всі котики дають на 1 монету більше"""".

На словах звучить доволі непогано. Але перші 20-30 партій будуть більше дратувати, ніж розважати. Бо об'єктів - величезна кількість. Побачити загальну картину того, що з чим входить в синергію - неможливо (лише з часом потроху починає розуміти). Графіка не дозволяє легко зрозуміти різницю між багатьома об'єктами, доки не витратиш час на те, щоб вивчити їх. Гра максимально випадково видає об'єкти та бонуси. Тож навіть якщо намагаєся з самого початку вибудувати якусь синергію - великі шанси, що не вдастся. Наприклад, набрав котиків, щоб потім давати їм молоко, а молоко взагалі не випадає.

Я планував закинути гру й залишити негативний відгук. Але вирішив дати їй ще один шанс. Врешті решт розібрався. Пройшов її на перших семи чи восьми рівнях складності (потім надоїло). На останній зіграній складності дійшов до такої синергії, що за спін заробляв по 2-5 тисяч, хоча мені потрібно було набрати 10 тисяч за 10 спінів. Таким чином я заробляв більше, ніж витрачав. Досягнути такого було приємно адже у більшості партій я програвав на завданні заробити 1500. 

Це гра про удачу. Але не в тому, як ігровий автомат викидає об'єкти. А в тому, які об'єкти даються на вибір гравцю. Гравець повинен витискати максимум з тих поганих і непідходящих об'єктів, які йому були видані. Причому, в більшості випадків об'єкт краще взагалі не брати.

Гра починає розважати, коли розумієш, що у тебе є 20 ячейок """"інтентаря"""", замаскованого під ігровий автомат. Ціль - зібрати з кожної ячейки якомога більше монет, враховуючі можливі синергії. Тобто, якщо ціль - заробити 100 монет за 5 спінів, це значить, що гравець повинен за кожний спін заробляти по 20 монет. Це значить, що якщо у кожній ячейці ігрового автомата є по одному об'єкту, який генерує по 1 монетці, то ціль буде досягнута. Але гравець повинен думати наперед. Бо наступною задачею буде заробити 150 монеток за 6 спінів (25 монеток за спін). Тому потрібно заздалегідь добитися того, щоб у якихось ячейках були об'єкти, що генерують 2 монетки за хід. Або щоб були синергії, які, якщо об'єкти згенерувалися поруч, дають додаткові гроші. 

Коли таке розуміння приходить, гра стає більш цікавою, бо починаєш розуміти, що є головним. А саме - оптимізація інвентаря, а не те, як ігровий автомат виставить об'єкти на екрані.

Це специфічна гра, яка не всім сподобається, і я б не радив її своїм друзям. Але раз уже написав такий довгий відгук, то вона мене трохи зачепила. Тому загалом я її рекомендую спробувати та розібратися (особливо, якщо граєте на Steam Deck)."" | 为什么我身家几百亿了还是要交房租呢？"

First off the performance is all over the place.  I'm playing with a 4070 super and Intel 13700kf and I get all sorts of performance drops.

I've also played it on the Steam Deck and you'll be lucky to maintain 30 fps.   Another issue on the deck is that the cards are so big that they block the enemy's information half of the time, which is very annoying.

Blocking works differently than most other games in this genre where it will block a full attack regardless of the damage dealt.

拠点の機能を解放するのに、それぞれに対応した村人を拠点に勧誘する必要があります
ところが村人に出会えば即勧誘ではなく、そこで発生するクエストを完了させた後に、もう一度出会って初めて村に勧誘できるというシステム
要するに運が悪いと勧誘までに10回以上のランが必要になります
さらに付け加えれば、この手のクエストを完了する為には、何かしらのマイナスエフェクトを選択する必要があり、それが初期の弱い状態と相まって非常にストレスフルです
しかも機能を解放してから、ようやく雀の涙ほどの強化素材が集まるようになるので、まともな機能のアンロックは更にラン回数を重ねる必要が出てきます
選ぶキャラによっては、ゲームとして遊べる状態になるのがここからです

基本的には３種の職に亜種で３種類の計９キャラ（要アンロック）から選択となるのですが、この３種の職ごとの専用カードプールは亜種に関係なく共通となります
そして亜種の職はそれぞれのプレイスタイルに特化した専用能力を持っている為、基本的に職専用のカードの他の亜種の職カードは使い物にならない事が多く、初期の基本カードから邪魔なカードを数枚除去して、自分の職用のカードが数枚追加されるだけという、毎回同じスタイルのランにしかなり得ません
今回はこんなカードが引けたからこのデッキ構成でチャレンジしてみようとかがない為にリプレイ性がかなり乏しいです

そして雰囲気を重視するあまり、MAPがフィールドを歩き回るタイプにしていますが、基本的にMAPの形は固定で敵とイベント（基本セット）の配置位置も固定、配置される種類だけがランダムなタイプ
要するに歩き回る楽しみは最初の数回だけで、あとはただひたすらに面倒なだけ

一番絶許なのが、クエスト結果の永続化
ストーリーを重視する為に、クエストの進行にランの回数を要求した上でその最中の選択によって最終結果が変わるのですが、そのクエストの結果が永続効果となります
選択によって、この永続効果が変わる為に、うっかり宜しくない選択をすると一生ものの傷として残ります（カード３枚削除イベントの有無など）
ランの最中の選択によって効果の変わる結果は、そのランの最中だけという当たり前のお約束を平気で反故にしているのです

最初は一個ずつしか空いていないスロットも、拠点の永続強化でそれぞれ２つに、ＭＡＰの宝箱イベントでスロット枠解放を選べば、ほぼ確実に３つ空きます
ここに開始〇〇ターンに攻撃力△△アップとか、カード何枚目かを使用するとカードコストを１減らせるだとかをぶち込みます
また拠点購入の限定カードは、１戦闘１回限りですが１ターンの攻撃を大幅に上げたり、相手の防御を１ターン大幅に下げたり、手札を全部捨ててカードを５枚引いて、その使用コストを全部０にするといった狂った性能を持っています
これにＭＡＰで貰えるクエスト限定カード（いわゆるレジェンドカード）という、ゲームないで２～３回しか使えない消耗カードを上乗せするのです
これを脳筋系の職でやると大体１～２ターンでボスが沈みます
この辺りが出来る様になると、今までの不遇もあってか、一時的に脳汁出るくらい楽しくなるので、この手の仕様が好きな人には是非ここまで頑張って欲しいところ
ゲームとしてはＵＩ（召喚キャラへのカードの選択やルーンの融合など）も含めてお勧めできる完成度ではないですが、良きＢ級映画的な刺さる層には刺さる内容になっていますので、これを読んで興味を持った方はセールで安いときに買いましょう

とにかくサモナーまで解放して、全体攻撃のミニオン（真ん中））を初期召喚で選択、店に鍛冶屋がいるならCalcのルーン（戦闘開始ターンだけカードを一枚追加で引いてコスト-1）を購入
早めにゴーレム以外のミニオンは消す、なおゴーレムは２～３体デッキに入れるのを推奨
開始ターンにゴーレムが召喚できない時はアイテム使って何とかしのぐ
ゴーレムが場いて自分にシールドが貼ってあればまず安泰
最低限守りさえ固めておけば、毎ターン０コスで貰える職業限定カードで全体攻撃のミニオンを１回は起動できる
これで大抵はボスクリアまでいけるハズです

こんなゴミでどうやってクリア出来るんだよってキャラで無双できる喜びを貴方も味わってみませんか？ | Classes feel incredibly unbalanced and while I liked the original mechanics, I wasn't able to have fun with them since it all felt unfair to me. My third run I killed the end (true) boss at about 4.5k damage, so its not like I'm stuck or anything, its just that even on low difficulties I seemed to be relying on draw RNG too heavily and would just die sometimes. Combats seemed to just take too long if I focused on defense, and if I wanted to make a deck that has the power to make things move along, living turned into a bit of an RNG fest. Perhaps I just didn't stick with it long enough to see what each classes source of exponential damage was supposed to be, but I am simply getting pissed at how random the difficulty feels so I'm just going to put it down I think.

The dialogue and quests I found really interesting (including full voice acting!) but I just got annoyed when I died instead of being excited about unlocking new stuff. I love Slay the Spire and I played Monster Train for well over 200 hours with every achievement and every clan combination at divine victory. This game?

It's incredibly fun and immersive and hasn't gotten dull or boring after putting 70 hours into it the past few weeks.

The reason I can't recommend it is due to some pretty severe bugs that my friend and I have encountered.

Co-op is the reason I play the game, I wouldn't play it solo, its probably still fun solo, I just prefer playing with friends.
I am not sure if these game-breaking bugs are present in single player and I'm not keen on finding out.

There are some minor bugs here and there, NPCs roaming the map are invisible, the death animation for the two handed mace is backwards. These things I can look past.

The problem becomes when my friend and I spend over an hour clearing out a bandit camp and when we finally finish the fight, we get a black screen with no way to get out of it besides closing the game completely. This is a problem because then we have to go back to a previous save, which can sometimes be right outside the camp, within the battle, or sometimes we lose hours of progress. We have to be religious about saving the game because we have encountered this bug numerous times.

I can even look past this happening in bandit camps, because those are not necessary to the story. We can just skip them if the bug happens over and over. However, what I can't look past is when it happens in a story mission. My friend and I basically had to skip a whole region entirely because we were soft locked on a specific story mission in that area. We can't progress in the region without completing it, and no matter what we did, every time we fought the battle, it resulted in a black screen for both of us. After hours of trying to fix it we eventually cut our losses and moved to the next region. 

I am not sure if many other people experience this bug, I haven't seen much chatter about it online. But for me, It really takes the wind out of our sails after spending hours on a really tough fight, only for none of it to matter and have to go to an earlier save to attempt it again. All the while wondering if it will even work the next time.

I will change my review to recommended after this bug gets resolved, but until then I have to not recommend it, even though the game is great :(. |

The combat feels satisfying, and it is enjoyable kitting out your various mercs. I love setting up the base camp. There's a lot of 'Oh, that's cool!' moments, like the first time you explore a tomb. A few things that are very pleasant surprises, like having rather excellent voice acting (but having more line variations would be nice). The different zones are all varied, and have interesting casts of characters and qualities.

I would enjoy more customisation for your mercenaries, like picking voices/customising them after you pick them up beyond haircuts, and there are quite a few mechanics that aren't explained well, or at all, which forces you to look at information online, which is scant for some topics.

I've definitely gotten my money's worth, and the various DLCs are all fun and different in their own right. I hope the game continues to succeed. | The game necessitates far too much grinding without offering up enough smart, interesting content to bother with.

Games good but feels a bit short | 是我喜欢的游戏模式，挑战难度还是挺高的，可惜的是不能和朋友一起联机，希望以后可以开发联机模式 | 一款优秀的CDDA+僵毁式回合制僵尸末日生存冒险模拟游戏，更是一款典型的保留传统rl风味的现代化肉鸽的优秀范本。

我格外欣赏游戏繁而不杂的系统结构。很多人将本作和著名经典肉鸽CDDA做比较，我认为本作某种程度上确实可以算是CDDA的精简化与现代化版本。游戏还原继承了CDDA那种细节狂魔到一个物体的重量体积材质清洁度导电性耐潮性等特性能密密麻麻写几页的广度，但又做了足够现代化的优化和精简，确保所有复杂度都属逻辑自洽相互关联的有机整合，而不是“先穿内衣才能穿胸甲”这种为了某种风味而徒增玩家琐碎冗余操作负担的糟粕。

就比如游戏的工具系统：小刀剥皮加工、剪刀剪铁丝网、斧子劈砍家具、锤子加固门窗、撬棍强开门窗、螺丝刀修小机器、扳手修大机器、针线修衣服、铲子挖障碍、犁耙锄地、鱼竿钓鱼、平底锅炒菜、大锅煮菜……必要时这些工具也可作为武器朝僵尸的头来两下。看似工具种类繁多，但一来工具设计符合直觉，让复杂的生存机制产生了优雅的秩序感；二来这些工具的功能都是和游戏整个末日生存的玩法体系相辅相成的，而没有为了多而多的突兀感，我想你都可以仅通过我对工具的介绍窥到游戏玩法全貌的一隅。

游戏通过结局多样性的方式来控制难度，最简单的终点站结局只需收集基本物资一路逃离到终点站，难度很低相当于教学，熟练玩家甚至能做到游戏内一天(游戏内1h为1回合)速通。进阶结局则相对复杂：海线需要学三册轮船驾驶并修好轮船，空线需要学五册飞机驾驶找到直升机机油并杀入军事基地开走直升机，基地结局需要把民间武装基地[strike]伸手党大爷[/strike]伺候到好感度满100，还有更硬核有挑战性的征服结局和疫苗结局作为玩家的终极试炼。

在《终点站》，你可以是专注捡垃圾的末日仓鼠、沉迷钓鱼种田的废土陶渊明、开着消防车横冲直撞的疯狂麦克斯……谁能拒绝在僵尸围城时躲在安全屋一边品味从材料到厨具到烹制都由队友精心准备的纯天然大餐一边通过看书练出八块腹肌的养老生活呢？ | Вообще первые часиков 30 более менее интересно, но потом ОСОБЕННО если захочешь 100 процентов отчивок начинается гринд.

Top lesson learned after some 10 hours in the game - you got to hustle if you want to survive. The world does not revolve around you.

Playing gallant knight will get you poor. Playing total scum will get you much hate. You wanna live a little - you gotta cheat a little... and compromise a LOT.

10 real lives out of 10. | I started playing this game during version 1.1 and had a fair bit of fun with it.  However, subsequent updates have carved away just about all of the fun-factor I was experiencing.  The devs seem more focused on stripping away any hint of meta with heavy-handed gameplay changes in order to make the game as difficult as possible, even on 'easy' mode.  Each update from 1.1 brought changes to discourage specific character builds that trivialized the late game, but(IMO) it only succeeded in nerfing certain builds to the point of them being nearly useless, partially broken, or extremely inefficient.  More often than not, I found myself relying on save-scumming and RNG to get me through the content.

For those who will focus on the 70+ hours I sank into this game, understand that 90% of this play time happened when I was still enjoying myself and prior to the updates leading to version 1.3. | Should have just called this game ""RNGsus Will Roll.""

Because that's what it is.  That's ALL it is.  A non-stop use of the Random Number Generator, coupled with a Dark Souls like desire to abuse the player.

I find the best strategy is to save scum a training-gamble for rest-repeat scenario.  The rest is utterly useless, and annoyingly silly. | По картинкам мне казалась игра полная ерунда, но описание зацепило и рискнул! 

Игра мне очень понравилась, визуально конечно так себе, анимаций нет, просто картинки, да и игра вроде сделана на движке, в котором обычно визуальные новеллы клепаются. Впрочем это по сути и есть новелла со встроенной рпг. 

Я огромный кайф получил с того, что мы начинаем играть с английского ополченца, где в боях будем себя по разному проявлять и выживать, получать уважение от солдат и\или командования, повышения, новые доспехи и оружие.

Игра смешанного жанра, есть ролевая составлящая и тактические бои. Собственно, это её и губит в некотором роде. Бои скучные: на легком уровне превращаются в условность, на среднем — в нудную рутину на десятки раундов. Я думаю, получилось бы интереснее, впиши разработчики сражения в тот же нарратив со скиллчеками, что и квесты.
Помимо этого имеем неудобный интерфейс, где правая кнопка мыши зачем-то выполняет фукцию главного меню, и баги. Есть мелкие, есть крупный, который не дает пройти один из рутов.

ナイトメア40以降は神秘の店で強力な移動カード、ノックバック、アクセサリーを引けるかどうかの運ゲーになります。敵の出現の仕方によっては1バトル目で詰むので根気が必要です。9割運ゲー1割実力って感じ。 | Alina of the Arena is an awesome game. I never tried a deck builder like it before, but can’t stop playing. I first started expecting not much but with every run I learned more about mechanics, enemies, tactics etc. and still have not tried out or learned everything. Only downside is that I would like to have more… maybe a part two will happen in the future? I hope so!

I don’t want to get in much details but just be aware that this game is not only a deck builder but also a rogue like and tactics game. Give it a try if you are interested.

To make the start a bit easier let me give you some advice, but be aware of spoilers:
[spoiler]- Always think ahead. Not only what cards you might play next but your positioning!
- Cards or items which let you avoid or reduce damage in any way are very powerful. This can be achieved not only by movement, but kicks, pushes, interrupts, traps, abilities, items etc. – be creative
- Achievements or unlocking new classes can be done with all difficulties
- Classes differ in their play style. Some are better for offence, others for defence (block) or can do both well. I tried them all. Some are very fun and insanely powerful like pyromancer, hunter or mercenary. Others or more difficult to handle like samurai or deprived
- You can drink a potion after a fight without taking it in your item slot. Just click on the potion in the menu where you can replace items which were thrown into the arena and choose the option “use”
- You can reload ranged weapons with all combat cards if they have the correct colour even if they are defence (block) cards
- Two-handed ranged weapons can be reloaded with both red and blue combat cards
- Reloading a weapon with a combat card does not cost any action points
- Using a combat card which can only be used once per fight, is not exhausted if you use it for reloading[/spoiler] | If you like roguelike deckbuilders and tactics games, you'll probably go on a binge with this one. To be honest, there's nothing groundbreaking about the few new things this game adds to combat based deckbuilders, it's just that Alina of the Arena tramples over every mark outstandingly. | 很好玩的遊戲

76561198192893105,1708010,The Expanse: A Telltale Series,0.0,"Adventure, RPG",0,"Man, maybe it’s because I missed Telltale games SO MUCH, but I really adored this game. It was definitely alright. Sometimes it felt incredibly slow, but the story was fun and kept me hooked. It’s not for kids, obviously, but adults who enjoy narrative-driven games like Telltale’s will definitely like it, even if just a little.

Oh, and it's safe to mention that I went in absolutely blind; I’ve never seen the TV series or read the books, so it was all fresh to me! Give it a go, you won’t regret it.

Although... needing to buy the DLC to have a chance of 100%ing the game is straight up awful. | The Expanse: A Telltale Series - ещё одна игра от некогда известной студии Telltale, подарившей нам такие замечательные проекты, как The Walking Dead, A Wolf Among Us, Batman и другие. 

В данном случае, игра сделана по мотивам одномённого сериала (который, я к слову, (пока) не смотрел). Однако приятная цена на распродаже и моя любовь к старым проектам студии, да и жанру в целом, побудила к покупке.

Пожалуй, первое, что мне понравилось - это довольно мрачная атмосфера космоса и самой обстановки. В центре истории команда мародёров, которые ищут возможность заработать. У каждого персонажа своя предыстория (в основном, довольно мрачная: большинство из них бывшие военные, авантюристы и просто преступники). Соответственно, ни о какой дружественной атмосфере в духе Mass Effect тут речи не идёт - мотивы всех понятны, и сотрудничают все по одной и той же причине. Реалистично, не правда ли? Здесь нет однозначно положительных и отрицательных персонажей - и это здорово!

По мере развития сюжета, всё же команда главной героини формируется не как “горстка желающих заработать”, а скорее уже именно как команда. В общем, история вышла весьма увлекательной. Но, к сожалению, не особо продолжительной - всего около пяти часов.

Что отличает The Expanse от других проектов Telltale, да и вообще других игр жанра интерактивного кино - это геймплей, а вернее его процентное соотношение. Если обычно в подобных играх соотношение катсцен - 70/30%, и иногда даже больше в пользу катсцен, то здесь совсем наоборот. Да, здесь большую часть времени мы перемещаемся по локациям - есть даже возможность переключения между режимом с гравитации и невесомостью. Есть также дополнительные задания на поиск предметов, которые влияют на сюжет. 

В плане графики игра довольно проста по нынешним меркам, а также выполнена в фирменном стиле Telltale, также отсутствуют DLSS и Frame Generation, несмотря на то, что игра вышла в конце 2023 года. Однако оптимизация довольно хорошая и запустить в 4K можно практически на любой современной системе даже без помощи DLSS и FG.

Что, пожалуй, может, разочаровать - это короткая продолжительность. Целиком пройти игру мне удалось всего за два вечера после работы - то-есть, примерно за пять часов, если отбросить перерывы на кофе и курение. Соответственно, это вызывает вопрос того, стоит ли за такой короткий проект платить полную стоимость.

В целом же, The Expanse: A Telltale Series - это весьма интересный проект, который принёс мне массу удовольствия. Покупал я игру со скидкой -75% и я полностью остался доволен игрой - а вот покупать за полную цену я бы не рекомендовал из-за короткой продолжительности. Но в любом случае, игра придётся по вкусу всем любителям интерактивного кино.
 | Не люблю ставить пальцы вниз играм, но тут, все-таки, придется. 

Для начала голые факты, которые НЕ повлияли на мою оценку, но могут быть важны для кого-то:
1. Не поддерживается широкий экран
2. Большинство персонажей женщины, рулят всем женщины
3. Есть ЛГБТ

Теперь то, что НЕ ПОНРАВИЛОСЬ лично мне:
1. Слабо знакомят с лором, предполагается, что вы в курсе первоисточников и разберетесь сами.
2. Неприятные персонажи, которые не вызывают привязанности или особенных эмоций (кроме 2х)
3. Гг уже существующий персонаж вселенной и она НЕ может делать какие-то дичайшие выборы, которые мне бы, например, хотелось. Мне очень хотелось согласиться на предложение Matna, но не дали, потому что героиня по канону бы так не поступила.
4. Выборы не особо интересны (дать чапалах/пощадить), и порой на экранах с процентным соотношением выборов игроков, я видела что были еще какие-то варианты, но мне их обнаружить не удалось.
5. Геймплей с исследованием останков кораблей уныл. Там однообразные дыры в обшивке, и ты ползаешь в этих кораблях, как червяк в яблоке, чтобы найти какие-то фитюльки, которые могут быть почти где угодно. Кстати, достижения на этих фитюльках завязаны многие.
6. Невозможно пропустить болтовню, если ты, например, хочешь переиграть эпизод.

А теперь ПЛЮСЫ:
1. Крутая атмосфера: мрачная и местами просто-таки безнадежная. Особенно понравился третий эпизод.
2. Разработчики особо не стеснялись жестокости.
3. Игра хорошо выглядит.
4. Местами история вызывает интерес.

Nothing about it sounded fun. But then I watched a video of someone playing it on YouTube and thought it looked much more fun than the promotional videos had shown. So I gave it a try and OMG, I totally enjoyed this game. It has no right to be as fun as it is. I tend to be a completionist and this game helped scratch that itch. The best part is that I'm a huge fan of Castlevania so that DLC was just the greatest thing I never knew I needed. Seriously, for me the Castlevania DLC made the game at least 10x more fun.

My only complaint would be it's kind of a one and done for me. Once everything is collected I don't feel a need to play it. Loved playing it that first time around though, collecting all the things, unlocking all the stuff, it was fantastic. I'd have to do a complete fresh install to relock everything to make unlocking it again enjoyable. But still, it was the best 190+ hours of my recent gaming life :D | It's a fun game where you survive 30 minutes at a time (15 with hurry mode or endless when unlocked) as hordes of enemies crowd your screen and you get ever increasingly ridiculous weapons. A good number of hours out of it, especially for the price point. There's a lot of characters, different weapons, evolutions, secrets, stages etc. Sometimes things get so ridiculous that you can't even see what's going on anymore, but it's all part of the charm of the game.

I don't really have any critiques, because it does what it sets out to very well. I will say though that the game is considerably easier than I expected it was going to be going in. | A lot of people like it but I honestly found it kind of boring.

El contenido que obtienes de juego por lo que pagas es totalmente justo, ya poseo todos los DLC hasta la fecha y realmente cada uno suma una cantidad de contenido absurdo que da para aun mas horas de juego.

Además, como fan de la saga Castlevania es muy divertido ir notando cada una de las referencias que guarda este juego y cuando añadieron el DLC de Castlevania, literalmente explote.
 | This game has the best ratio between the amount of fun you'll have with the fewest amount of buttons. I've never played anything this deep with literally just WSAD and Space.

Give yourselves some credit, devs. And thanks for the full ultrawide support, although I would prefer a third option to solid and transparent black bars, which would be no black bars, but that's a massive nitpick.

EDIT: Ooooooh! That's how they make money! They have DLCs, so the whole game is actually 20€ if you want everything. That makes way more sense. Still too cheap though, because from what I've tried from the DLCs so far, they are very good and definitely worth the asking price."

But there is enough here to dislike that I don't come out recommending it. I come back to it from time to time but it always seems like I only do that once sufficient time has passed that I have forgotten how annoying it is to play. 

The art is great, the variety of playable characters is nice and I enjoy that unlike Slay The Spire, the ""route"" you take to the boss is much more simple. I like that you only need to focus on what is directly in front of you rather than having to plan out a route from the start. In StS it feels like there is a boring time sink at the start of every act in the route planning. 

The bad parts about this game are significant. There are many, many times where you are offered a card or a relic and the info doesn't come with a pop up menu that tells you enough about the card. Or the card will have a key term and you simply don't have a way to work out what the key term is. Normally it shows it but for example if you are offered a card that generates ANOTHER card. The key words on the first card will pop up, but the key words on the card it makes, wont. This is basic quality of life stuff that make it annoying to play. Nothing feels worse than making a bad choice because the game wasn't clear. 
The other major issue I have with the game is EVERY fight has multiple enemies that each have multiple passive effects and the symbols that denote those effects aren't clear at a glance (there are too many and the difference between them can be slight.) You will spend a LOT of time hovering over their effects to work out what the optimal play is at any time. The thing that makes this bothersome is, there IS normally an optimal play and working out what it is, isn't that hard. It's just time consuming. Something like. ""this enemy gains strength every time you hurt another enemy."" and the other enemy has ""all other enemies heal when this enemy dies"" So it makes sense then to kill the strength gaining enemy first so it doesn't buff heaps and then heal when the other one dies. BUT there are like 2 or 3 of those buffs PER ENEMY and then there are 3 enemies and sometimes after you kill 1 enemy you get more enemies ""reinforcing"" the fight each which might have different buffs. So it isn't ""hard"" just really tedious. It's like if I told you to add a string of 17 numbers together. You could easily do it. It just takes time, and the DOING of it, isn't fun. 

The game also feels much less deck BUILDER than StS. You really are challenged to play what cards you are FORCED to take in an optimal way, rather than building what you want given the choices you have been offered. Put another way, StS says ""make a deck strong enough to beat the game"" this game says ""Play the deck you have been given well enough to beat the game"" | 关底想用SL大法，结果存档直接消失，心态炸裂。虽然是打牌加入动作元素，但是咱就是说人也得思考，准备打下一张的时候，动作子弹时间已经结束了，爽但是没有完全爽。 | 8/10

 | I never wanted to 100% a game so bad!!!

Brotato is a very simple rougelite however what makes the game really fun is the many characters combined with the many weapons COMBINED with items and levels. Holy hell you get so much replay value. Not to mention harder difficulty modes to add more challenges. 

The gameplay loop is very simple yet the game knows this and doubles down. 
Honestly the price is a total steal but the game does go on sale.

I totally recommend the game :3

Cube Chaos has a bit of a learning curve wrapping your head around exactly how things work, such as the way cubes in your hand operate versus the field, adjacency shenanigans, and a lil bit of reading but after just a little bit, you'll be finding ways to charge into the enemy with infinite health, or spawn an endless swarm of bees and much, much, much more.

highly recommend if you dont mind simpler graphics, and lots of unique interactions. | The ugliest and most unbalanced video game I've ever played. This game represents the pinnacle of the roguelite genre. If you like roguelikes and you like computer science, you need to play this game. 

No other game can present anything close to the sheer number of possibilities this game presents. A game like Risk of Rain or Slay the Spire might have a few hundred distinct strategies. Maybe a thousand? In this game, you will regularly discover synergies that no other player has seen before. Every time you get to choose a new perk or cube to obtain, you can't help but fantasize about how each one might fit into your run to produce something utterly broken and unstoppable. Sometimes you stumble upon a synergy you didn't even notice. Every run is [i] genuinely [/i] unique, and the feeling of discovering a new strategy is amazing. 

I love the absurdity of some of the game mechanics. You can have negative gold, negative mana, and negative lives. You can fuse cubes together into combinations. You can have more than one leader. There are perks that make cubes in your hand experience time and perform actions, even tho they haven't been placed in the world yet. There is a challenge where the enemies literally cannot die. And yet it is still possible to win. This game is truly the cube chaos.

The descriptions are hard to understand in such a way that they make perfect sense to a programmer. There is no vagueness, you can tell exactly what a cube does by reading its abilities, which means they can be wordy. Just like code. The way that abilities are added or removed from cubes in a completely modular fashion is deeply satisfying.

I need more people to try this game. It is the ultimate game of the synergy based roguelike genre. | The players races are awesome, as are the classes. The sprites are very creative, and you can do so much with the things you're given, it's definitely a game for people who like to tinker with game mechanics to achieve wild results. | Honestly one of the most interesting and fun games I've played.

If you like complex games without being over the top then you'll enjoy the game.

One of the recent runs was spamming the field with fungus spores and then having dozens of minion hatching from within.

An earlier run? I got a bouncy ball and placed it...

Little did I know I forgot I had ""1% chance to duplicate when moving"" as well as a perk that ""Move a second time when moving""

The entire map filled with bouncy balls lagging my game to a halt.

Honestly I only have a couple criticisms. For example I don't really like the programmer class, I find it hard to get a full selection of the perks that work with your build by the time you reach the end for it to be good. I feel you should get a generic base set of perks for the class an example would be something like on ally move ally gains 1 max hp or something along those lines because then you could swap out the max hp part or the ally move part or something like that but at-least you have something that you can build around at the start instead of getting something you can't use

It was glorious, runs can last an hour and sometimes 20 minutes.

76561198192893105,597180,Old World,18.916666666666668,"Simulation, Strategy",26,"Old World (OW) is brilliant in its design and the experience it creates. OW is the most interesting, if not the best, 4x, tactical, turn based strategy currently! Complex, challenging and fun!

(MANY) POSITIVES
1 AN AMAZING PACE: OW has a brilliant mechanic of Orders that limits how much you can do in a turn. Everything, but production in cities, costs Orders: moving and using workers, scouts, army, attacking, council tasks, interactions with courtiers and nations. Each turn you think, prioritize and make choices. 
This way everything in OW feels earned. Because of the Orders limitation even in the late game a war can be exhausting for your empire. Moving many army units can deplete your Orders pool, not leaving any for workers, heir education, or scouts. Of course things get easier with time, but still you can find yourself vulnerable. One of the rare strategy games where the late game is cool!

2 CLEVER SYNERGY OF THE GAME'S SYSTEMS
In OW everything relates in a deep, satisfying way. Opinions of you impact how well armies fight, productivity of your cities, courtiers interactions with you. Resources and Buildings have efficiency combinations. All systems of OW interact.

3 TACTICAL WARS WITH PROPER AI
OW has competent AI that plays the game properly. It's perhaps a 4x game with one of the better AIs I've played against. In a war it tries to flank you for max damage, shoot from hills for maximum range, use forests to minimize ranged damage etc. War in OW is tactical. Flanking, units adjacency, terrain, and preparation (you can't heal in a neutral land, unless you have certain skills) - it all matters. 

4 DIPLOMACY IS COMPLEX AND CRUCIAL
Diplomacy in OW has two levels: internal and international with Opinions mechanic that synergizes with other systems. 
In OW you don't just establish cities of your civilization. With each new city you choose a renown family to run it (3 families each game out of 4 options; each nation has a different set). They have different bonuses, interactions with terrain, demands and limits to what character can govern their city. This way cities are different to each other. The Families opinion matters. Low Family opinion affects the maintenance of their cities. Armies you produce belong to the families and their combat effectiveness synergizes with your internal diplomacy as well (including General's opinion of you if one is added to an army).
On top of that you also have individual characters (courtiers) with friendships, love affairs, rivalry, assassinations, ambitions (power hungry), or significant public popularity (Rising Stars that can overthrow you). You also have civil wars where you may end up destroying your own city. 
Wars in OW can be intense and can significantly compromise what you can do in a turn. It really pays off to prevent war with a political marriage, even with a tribal leader against the public opinion, than risk invasions on multiple fronts. Besides, happiness in attacked cities tanks down and this can trigger further problems (unhappiness raises city's maintenance and a chance of rebellion). War in OW is a big deal: victories can boost your Legitimacy, but defeats break it. You need alliances and proper diplomacy to secure survival. You invest in building trust (Opinion) for more diplomatic options. 

5 The BARBARIANS, TRIBES AND FIXED CITY SPOTS
Besides different nations OW has Barbarians and 6 different tribes. Tribes may occupy vast or smaller map space with their camps. And the tribes in OW can be devastating. Each camp spawns units every few years and if too many they become raiders, even if you're at peace with them. You can get unexpected mini invasions where they pillage, attack cities and wound/kill workers. So your city placement, armies stationing and natural barriers like mountains play a role. 
There are benefits to defeating tribes and to alliances with them. In OW you have fixed city settlement locations. A few guaranteed ones at the start; more you get from warfare or diplomacy. I think the fixed City Spots improve the game significantly. There's no dumb AI settling a city on your border for irrational tensions. And a wide expansion makes you think and plan how you can secure distant, new cities. 
Overall, the tribes in OW add a lot of tension, threat and historical sensitivity that I really like.

6 ECONOMY WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF RESOURCE TYPES
All resources matter and you can run short of something even in the late game. Access to the best units is not just a matter of tech, but also depends on the level of your culture, a chain of buildings and multiple resources to maintain them.

7 DYNAMIC, MORTAL CHARACTERS
Playing as a mortal ruler, that you develop in stats and traits, is more fun than having one fixed option throughout eras.
I love the Archetypes for Characters, with different layers of bonuses when acting as the Leader, Governor or army Commander. For Instance a Builder Leader can assign multiple workers to a project and they have -1 turn to build improvements and more. 
It's also brilliant that courtiers' stats contribute to the resources pool of your empire. Giving them a job provides a yearly experience, thus upgrades. Using courtiers missions gives them even more experience. This way even having spy agents in foreign empires benefit your resources pool. Its a dynamic system where you want to use courtiers, they change and play an important role. 

8 EVENTS THAT BRING FLAVOR AND VARIETY
OW claims to have over 3 thousand events!!! Some go in chains and develop over time. Some involve historic characters and situations. I love that the OW events pop up with jingle sounds! Big, immersive windows with beautiful art! Love all the art of Wonders especially – they represent so well the grand scale of these projects! My favorite events are when a courtier becomes inspired by my empire's wonder (that they aren't just buildings with buffs) and when a battles winning general becomes a Rising Star and creates a political threat. It's empire AND character building together with storytelling.

9 there is DEPTH, NUANCES, AND HISTORIC SENSITIVITY
So many things in OW make it's ""world"" alive and interesting beyond the clickfest of developing tiles or attacking.
When your worker is wounded it builds a turn longer. 
When you're allied with a tribe you control their units. And when ravaged by war a Tribe can ask you for refuge, creating slums in your city. 
Scouts in OW can do many things and remain useful. From providing Legitimacy for discovered landmarks, to harvesting resources and spying. With proper tech, a Scout can establish spy network in foreign city. Then your spies can provide you with vision and destabilization options; for instance you can try to trigger rebellions in several cities at once right before you attack. All these in a Civilization like game!!!

I also like that the Tech options are semi-random.

10 ART STYLE, (fantastic) MUSIC, and ATMOSPHERE
Music in the OW is just AWESOME! Sometimes I just keep playing OW because I enjoy its soundtrack so much. 
It's a good looking game that sticks to one period of history but with depth and atmosphere. This way playtime isn't that long, but isn't short either. Due to the Orders mechanic limitations other players turns go fast, so less waiting time.

LAST BUT NOT LEAST
The game has never crashed for me.
I haven't found OW to be overwhelming to learn. It took me around 10 hours to become familiar with all the basics. OW has an excellent in-game encyclopedia.
The game is very customizable. 
The base game of OW has the full, good experience and not hiding crucial features behind paid DLCs. 
OW is first and foremost a great strategy game (with RPG flavor). It has a healthy complexity, depth, historic references, and fulfilling struggle.

NEGATIVES
In spite of symmetrical design, I've got an impression some nations are much better than others. I'm still figuring out if it's inflexibility of my playstyle or design's imbalance. | I am a university professor, game developer, and 4X TBS game fanatic. I played, developed, collaborated on, play tested, analyzed, wrote about, and searched for 4X TBS games most of my life. 
I played thousands of games and tens of thousands of hours of TBS games. I make this post after 300 hours of playing Old World. My estimated level of knowing and understanding Old World and its features: 60%.
Far from being perfect, but my perception is that Old World is currently the second best game out there. (I may be biased to 4X TBS, although I played many other genres).
Old World has the usual big problems with the UI: cumbersome, confusing, slow, buggy. Its AI seems to be somewhat better than the other 4X TBS AIs. As of today, 4X TBS AIs without exception are very poor based on my personal experience with hundreds of these games. 
But Old World’s design is one of the best I have seen so far in any 4X TBS game. Finally, I see Order Points that limit the number of actions per turn and limit my movements. I advocated for this for 30 years in 4X TBS development. This game has great feature diversity, depth, and attention to details. Many things can be customized, even the music. I am yet to try the multiplayer. The developers genuinely understand and care about their product which combo is rare to find in the 4X TBS genre. This is not just another dumbed down “clone” of an earlier game that dominates the 4X TBS market today. They still push new patches which is great. This game is similar to Civilization 4, but much better. It also has tactical depth, role playing, and probabilistic planning, and a lot more. Kudos to the developers and I wish they will provide many years of support to fix the bugs, improve the UI, further tune the balance, and strengthen the AI to make the game even better than now.
 | I cannot describe just how much this game has come to dominate my life in the last two years. I've racked up over 1200 hours and I'm only jut starting to ease up.

Old World looks, feels and plays like it was made by 4X fans for 4X fans. It remedies so many of the genre's pitfalls, and the replay value is through the roof. The mix of nations, families, events and characters give each and every game a different flavour. The developers have also kept it consistently patched and tweaked. Cannot recommend it enough, this game beats any other in the genre. | This game cheats during combat. Making moves the player can't make. 
The Computer always has 2,000 Shields, which allows it to Force March troops, even after spending all of those points to move troops or attack. 
EVERY army the AI has, has a General in it. 
The AI brings back Generals the next turn.
It's oppressive. 
90% of the Events that happen are bad for you, or negative, or cause negative effects.
It's way too hard to be peaceful and ally with another nation. 
No matter what you do, what tech you have, or how good you are with other AI players, they backstab you.
The Orders system is F'd, because you're restricted every turn, and you can't DO everything you need to do in your turn, like fight a war. If your king/queen has less Orders (moves) than the enemy and you have to fight a war, you're already dead. I hate it. 
I've been trying to deal with this since I got the game, and have disliked it, and the further I get into a game, the worse it becomes. This ONE issue is enough to make me never play it again.

I've been spending up to 12 hours a day in this game for days now, and it's just stupidly overpowered against the player. Just when you start to get things right, the game sh_its on you. I had a few years of absolute peace, and building up my army and building up my cities, only to get absolutely rolled by the AI, who always had better tech, had more troops, and never ran out of Generals. 
The movement across mountains, or using more Shield points than it should have to move troops is what did it for me. 
I know the AI cheats in every game vs. Humans, but this is ridiculous. 
F this game. It's got so many problems that Civ doesn't have. It's like they looked at Civ and went, ""You know, how do we make the game way harder, and more difficult at the same time?... Oh, I know! We'll add families and traits, and negative events THAT NEVER STOP every turn so the player never wins...""
Also, this game will make your computer get really hot, max our your fans on your GPU, and has a conflict with Medal where it makes Medal tell you it's going to record the game every 5 min. 
I had 2 cores heat up to 92c, which NEVER happens. And maxed out all of my P-Cores to min of 80c. (80-92c) That's insane!
I have a 13900K (Yes, I did the BIOS update to keep it from melting.) with a Lian Li 360 AIO running at full speed 100% of the time, and a total of 7 fans. 32GB of DDR5, and a 2080Super. I watch HWMointor because this game makes my computer a Space Heater. I watch voltages, I watch clock speeds on all cores, and I watch temperatures. No other game does this to my machine.

Just go play Civ and be happy. | Eine Partie Old World zu spielen ist für mich immer etwas besonderes.Jedesmal erlebe ich eine neue Geschichte und es ist einfach spannend.Fazinierend wie die Entwickler dieses auf die Beine gestellt haben.Wie die ganzen Mechaniken im Spiel ineinander greifen und ein so motivierendes immersives Spielerlebnis erzeugen.
Vorausgesetzt man lässt sich darauf ein.Denn es kann auch hart sein eine Partie zu spielen.Es kann frustrierend sein schlechte Zeiten zu überwinden oder mit  mehreren Kriegen konfrontiert zu werden.Sich dort durchzusetzen macht auch einen besonderen Reiz von Old World  aus.Für mich das beste 4x Game auf dem Markt.

As though they're designing it for the top 1% of players, balancing for some kind of insane hyper-competitive style. 
This is a single player game. It doesn't need to be insanely lethal to the point the only way to play is to go hyper-meta.
It doesn't need to have every single move 100% perfectly planned out in advance, to the point where a single level, let alone a single mission, takes a full two hours.

Meds no longer work, and so nothing you bring into mission really matters. You're practically speaking better off running naked with nothing but the emergency kit you get whenever a character dies, because at least then you lose nothing of value. 
You're going to get shot and take constant wounds that are just impossible to heal any more. Your limted inventory space means, even if you did have the meds necessary somehow to cover the myriad of wounds you get, you wouldn't be able to loot a single object in the game where that's the entire point. 
And this is something that isn't even new. This was an issue before. It was managable because at least you could use bandages and healing items to recover 'health' while primarily using cloth for the chance to bandage a bleed or a fracture. Now? That chance has been massively nerfed, and you're just as likely to get an infection. 

And, hey, that wouldn't be an issue... If every mission didn't have massive swarms of enemies, that outnumber you any time you step into a room. Enemies, thanks to the constant death, who inevitably have better equipment than you, and for that matter if you play at all further into the late game, better training than you. Which means, more wounds, which means, more burning through your meds, which means, you guessed it, more deaths.

The devs seem hellbent on making this game as miserable to play as possible.
Used to be really fun. Old versions were pretty reasonable, with a good balance across the board between what you, the player, could dish out, and what you could recover from.
Can't recommend it any more. 
As unfortunately common with Early Access games, the issue isn't so much unfulfilled promises, as the devs inevitably making a good game terrible. | Впервые увидел Quasimorph у Сета и заинтересовался игрой. Потом немного посмотрел у стримеров и в итоге решил купить. Наиграл сравнительно не так много, но у меня есть, что сказать. Если коротко -  это смесь Battle Brothers (прокачка, особенности пешек, контракты, фракции и изменчивый мир) и Stoneshard (единственный персонаж под управлением, система выживания, также прокачка и контракты).
Начну с плюсов:
+ Лор и сеттинг. Мрачный космос, раздираемый бесконечной войной между корпорациями, которые не обращают внимания на надвигающийся конец света в виде квазиморфов. Круто, мрачно, таинственно. Очень интересно читать все эти истории корпораций, благодаря этому чувствуется наполнение мира.
+ графон и стилистика. Очень приятно наблюдать за тем, как персонаж стреляет, болванчики отлетают, остаются следы пуль на стенах и тд. Окружение также разрушаемое.
+ музыка и саунддизайн. Очень мрачный эмбиент, боевые темы - всё звучит очень приятно. Пушки также очень смачно стреляют, заслушаешься.
Теперь о минусах. Скажу сразу, хоть и играл я немного, но они меня на данный момент заставили бросить игру и накатать негативный отзыв:
- торговля и экономика. Просто кусок мусора. Вообще не понимаю, нахрена было менять торговлю из ранних версий на бартер, то есть, это нормально, что мы в мире победившего анархо-капитализма работаем за пару ящиков воды, пару коробок патронов и рандомные штаны? Лорная отписка про то, что корпам запрещено торговать с ЧВК - просто бредятина, с учётом того, что на брифингах миссий постоянно упоминают, что есть конкурирующие ЧВК - то есть, их много... И они все работают за мусор. Причём награда за миссии выдаётся рандомными предметами + некий кредит у фракции, который можно потратить при прокачке репутации на станции. Только кредит ты хрен нормально потратишь - каждая станция производит что-то своё и по чуть-чуть, а активно прокачиваешь репутацию ты только у 2-3 фракций, так что удачи адекватно распорядиться этим кредитом. Днём с огнём не сыщешь что-то нужное. С торговлей глобально то же самое: ты можешь продать определённые, бартерные вещи, вроде ящиков инструментов или всяких дронов (а всего этого всегда мало или немного) на определённых станциях и на низкой репутации получить рандомный лут, при хорошей репутации - что-то конкретное, но из очень узкого сегмента того, что предлагает станция. Полный бред, крайне неудобно и не реалистично, самое смешное, что по таким законам экономики работают не только корпорации, а ещё и фракции вроде Сопротивления (тупо анархисты) или Тецклана (буквально злые демоны из ада), почему-то этот запрет торговли действует на всех.
- душнейшая метапрогрессия. Компоненты для прокачки корабля встречаются на миссиях и в продаже очень редко, так что необходимые грейды выбивать нужно очень долго. Часа 4 игрового времени прокачивал только пару самых базовых улучшений, в комментариях люди пишут, что в дальнейшем ситуация ещё усугубляется и придётся тратить на это десятки часов... Нет, спасибо. Ситуация также осложняется крайне ограниченным инвентарём, что не ещё сильнее затягивает процесс нахождения нужных деталей.
- однообразные миссии и неясная сложность. Поиск предмета, зачистка, защита точки - всё ощущается очень однообразно и быстро приедается. Также на скучноту влияют повторяющиеся декорации уровней. Всё так или иначе сводится с битвой с толпой болванчиков с очень слабым ИИ - они прут на вас нескончаемой волной, умирая в одной клетке. Со временем сражения начинают тупо утомлять. Кстати о черепках - это показатель сложности миссии и система абсолютно не информативные, велик шанс даже на 1 черепе встретить челика в топ броне и с гигапушкой.
- дисбаланс некоторых классов. Не успел пощупать глубинно всё что есть, но пока могу сказать, что ближний бой абсолютно бесполезен, как и класс/классы, заточенные под него. Игра про то, что в идеале в тебя вообще не должны стрелять. Боец даже в предтоп броне с ближней пушкой постоянно под огнём и постоянно будет огребать травмы и ранения, тупо аптечек не напасёшься. 
- неудобный и неинтуитивный интерфейс. Неудобно выбирать оперативников на контракт, неудобно смотреть, какие там товары какой станции нужны (при наведении на предмет ничего не показывается, надо открывать отдельное громоздкое окно курсов стоимости предметов, в котором даже нет поиска). Также чтобы открыть экран инвентаря корабля и оперативников ОБЯЗАТЕЛЬНО перед этим надо открыть окно прокачка корабля, хотя что там в инвентаре ты чекаешь постоянно, а корабль прокачивается раз в несколько часов.

В итоге могу сказать, что пока что игру к покупке не советую, для меня минусы перевесили плюсы, к тому же на неё жёсткий оверпрайс. Игра в раннем доступе стоит 700 при том, что это явно очень недопиленный продукт. Надеюсь разработчики что-то исправят. | I really, really like this game. These hours were all put in within a month of purchase. It's scratching an itch that I've had ever since my PC stopped running tarkov, and going beyond. 
It truly makes me feel like a singular capable soldier fighting an entire space station's garrison. You're better than most of the individual enemies you'll encounter, a lot of them going down in only a few shots, but all it takes is one poor decision on your part to be exposed to their gunfire, at best eating your precious medical supplies, and at worst leaving you dead within a few turns. These stakes give Quasimorph high tensions despite it being turn based, because every one of those turns can make or break the raid. 
And that's before the quasis get involved. The more humans you kill, the more bramfauna slip through the barrier between realities. On longer missions, it feels like fighting an SCP containment breach than a corporate outpost. The desperation of trying to bypass the hordes of otherworldly creatures before your supplies or ammo runs out is a feeling like no other.
Still, I won't blanket recommend this game to everyone I know. If you're not a fan of hardcore games or roguelikes, you probably won't enjoy Quasimorph. But for those who revel in having the odds stacked against you, and looting n shooting throughout, this game is a must. | aggravating, wasteful, and frustrating experience hiding under the  ""hurrdd currr gaeem"" label

UI wastes your time and is bulky without reason, even though there are mods already out to do the most down to earth features the devs refuse to.

For example; Every contract pretty much runs out before you arrive, you have to sit there and sift through a bunch of contracts that you'll never get to do. Why can't you reserve a contract just so you could do something, Why does the UI not tell you when you just straight up won't make it? Spoiler alert, even if it says you will hypothetically make it on time, the contract disappears if there's 10 - 20 hours remaining when you arrive.

Difficulty is pretty much just determined by enemy spam, and how many floors a mission has. Story missions are straight up bullsh*t with terrible pacing, giving you missions you'll never be able to achieve until you spend hours farming lower end missions. The ui for missions is also meaninglessly confusing, the ""difficulty skull"" rating fills from right to left, the power meter just spouts a random meaningless number that can either mean a bunch of bums with staple guns up to super soldiers or demons that can tank an entire magazine point blank and still beat you to death next turn.

The market system is a joke, mission ""cash"" rewards aren't a global pool, but pool up with individual corporations, and mission rewards will tell you one number, but you will always get 1/10th of the reward, regardless of your reputation. None of the faction gear is for sale, you have to pretty much just rely on them ""gifting"" it to you at the end of a mission instead of packs of nails or a burger. Purchasing wares to build your ship up is unbelievably annoying; at times you will travel an entire month to a location, just to realize you have a 75%+ upcharge on a good, and your 900, 1400, 5000 or whatever mission rewards turned out to be 100 spessos. Not to mention, at times you'll arrive and the goods aren't even on sale, or being bought anymore. 

tl;dr the pacing, difficulty, rewards system is annoying just to be annoying and waste your time, the UI is a mess, the entire combat system basically just revolves around sitting on a corner and sprint running in and out to fire, or just cheese corners with fire/poison which npcs will stupidly trudge through until they die."

:\ | Türk yapımı olduğu için aldım. Görünüşte Anna Purna oyunlarına yerli alternatif, eşdeğeri gibi duruyor. Ama gel gelelim, bu oyun eksik kardeşim. Mobil oyun olarak başladığınıza bu işi, itiraf edin. Ulan 1080p bile çözünürlük yok, dikey telefon açısından oynuyoruz. 
 Arayüz tasarımı iyi değil. Bir menü açılıyor, ama çözünürlük yüzünden okuyamıyorum, ekran alanının dışına çıkıyor. Bağımlısı da olmak istiyorum. Bir yerden sonra çözüyorum gibi mantığı. Ama yok. Abim bu oyun yarım. Cash-grab demek istemiyorum, yerli diye dokunduramıyorum. Ama buna başka bir şey diyemem. 2 öğrencinin; 'Az para kaldıralım, az geliştirelim sonra salarız.' dediği bir proje gibi duruyor.
 Destek olmayı cidden isterim. Ama kazıkçı bakkalın, zincir marketlere kaybetmesi gibi; bu oyunda bu hali ile ayakta kalamaz. Ya oyunu toplayın, ya da bu oyunun yavaş yavaş tozlu steam kütüphanelerinde negatif oylamalar ile kaybolmasını izleyin. 
 Bunu mobile çıkarsanız inanın bana daha başarılı olurdunuz. PC başına oturup, bir tane bina dikme oyununda yetenek ağacı kasacak adam tanımıyorum. Mobilde olsa, tuvalette işlem yaparken akar giderdi bu oyun. Her el başına reklam atardınız. Ciddi potansiyeli olan bir oyun, lakin baştan savma olmuş. | such a fun, creative, and engaging casual game. it's an entertaining puzzle-solver and also fulfills my desire for playing city builders. highly recommend."

传统CRPG，没有博得3精美的过场动画，但是巨量的文本+出色的翻译弥补了这点。对于一个AA级游戏来说把钱花到画面表现和过场动画还不如打磨好游戏本身。
这游戏对战锤世界观的介绍和名词的翻译的恰当真是非常出色。构筑也没有繁复到劝退新手。游戏体量足够支撑100小时。除了发售初期巨量的bug，貌似找不到太大的槽点。你还能要求什么呢？ | 感觉就是读本原汁原味40k小说...文本够多谈不上深刻但也言之有物,主线基本所有的对话都有语音...真的是吃到好东西了，

角色性格塑造细致入微，比如不同价值观的队友撕逼， 角色不能一味讨好得树立威信或胁迫外交才会服服帖帖，有趣！
就算支线脚本也用心了，都是由一个契合40k世界观的故事引入，呈现此背景下的人类生态，并进行道德或效率之间的权衡，而不是粗暴通马桶买蒜式战斗...选项也挺有趣，有些又皮又莽的选项真的手痒想选...（有次虽然知道40k底层人民的文化水平，但好奇还是选了个陈述厉害分析头头是道的选项，结果就突然冷场...笑死我了！）

战斗方面，和拉瑞安不同就是走格子，占比也没有那么多（主要文本量太多了），没什么战场骚操作，主打的是爽快利落，
每个职业的区别很大，机制有趣有效，bd丰富（所以让我回忆了玩永恒之柱时的痛苦记忆...加点选择太太太太多了，推荐项并非最优解，引导归类得很机械，所以得花时间甄别试错，就算我对这方面其实很感兴趣，但光看文字描述也真的一头雾水，有点痛苦...）

美术方面，小公司钱不多...很多“演出”都靠细腻的文字描写或者插画（比较穷酸...但我个人是很喜欢这种模式...）但场景做的很细，没有大场面都方方正正中规中矩，设计也挺不错，看得出用心了，不过就是很多用心搭建的场景中也没什么互动事件有时显得花瓶纯摆设了(毕竟博得吃的过好了).... 
人物脸模方面就普通略差hhhh，捏脸花了我一个半小时才选出个稍微能看的，不过40k也的确没什么帅哥美女就是了...


其他一些小缺点：
一些地图解谜虽说不多，但怎么说...比如继电器那个挺无聊的不像有内部试玩过...花了时间做但奖励也蚊子腿...不如不做...
loading切换稍微有点多


先记录下到目前得感受....就整个游戏体验目测怎么也得100多小时了，我又喜欢兜兜转转捡文本都读一读，通关不知道得何年那月了....

总结：如果对战锤40k世界观（基本所有的专有名词都带色差解释）和小说有兴趣，不抵触海量的文本，且对crpg有点兴趣的话就推荐（特别半价时）

ps：像博得3的邪道线一样，想等退休了再拿出来盘一盘，试试异端线！ | tldr: I played this game over 200 hours for the lore and I can’t recommend it before they fix the broken content, skills, items and quests, etc.

I love this game for the lore it has and how it is presented to the player but I can't really recommend it because the first two chapters of this game are one of the best 40k content I have ever seen in games but at chapter 3 the game goes stale and following chapters 4 and 5 are full of rushed content and game breaking bugs. Some quests barely work properly half of the time and there are many major and minor things that are left broken, one thing you will see fairly often are random NPCs running or sitting in the air and sometimes after a fight the dead enemies are still standing or can be interacted with.

On higher levels near the end of the game your characters might have skills that do not work properly and there is a serious bug that appears in combat where if you take a shot with any bolter weapon in a certain angle with 95% or even 100% hit chance the shot will always miss the target and any shot fired on the same angle from the tile your character is standing in will always miss. The “fix” is to walk one or more tiles to any direction and when the game tells you there is about 37% or lower hit chance it actually hits 100% of the time (yes, even if it gives no % or says 0%). There are also some skills that have 50/50 chance of breaking the game so that the combat can't progress to next turn and the only option is to reload a save and do it all again while hoping the bug does not appear this time. On top of this there are some broken items you can equip and they do not give you correct stats or bonuses. There is also a bug that makes it possible to cheat and use certain dialog options multiple times at least in chapter 3 so you can get same quest reward items at least twice, this exploit will work on some other side missions as well in different chapters.

After all of the above they are now pushing the new DLC content for us to buy and I can’t really see myself paying for extra content while the base product is clearly broken. I do however see potential in this game and I hope Owlcat fixes it. | [h3]Amazing Story[/h3]

The game reminds me a lot of Baldur's Gate 3, but more in a steampunk universe. The story and gameplay are amazing, but keep in mind that you need to read a LOT! I have never played a Warhammer game before or knew anything about the lore, but that did not stop me from enjoying this game. Mini games like colony management and space combat are decent and bring variety. Character development and classes are robust. I can't wait to play more! | Прошел 1, 2 Pathfinder, потом посоветовали поиграть в Rouge Trader
Господи, какая это пушка! Явно больше чем просто работа над ошибками

Плюсы:
Огромное количество возможностей для отыгрыша персонажа
Геймплей
Замечательный арт и дизайн уровней
Саундтрек (особенно музыка в капелле на флагмане)
В процессе игры отметил много QOL улучшений в интерфейсе, по сравнению с PF

Из минусов:
Были путанницы с новой ролевой системой
Зависания вовремя загрузок (локации/мостик)
Патчи ""на горячую"" меняющие характеристики персонажей и ломающие определенные билды в середине прохождения
ИМХО меньше мотивации для перепрохождения, геймплей не сильно изменится (на примере PF, путь ангела или путь роя)

Almost the same state of the game was available 1 year ago. I thought buying the early access would speed up the process, but it seems game is going to the void. | It might be a bit controversial to say this, but I like this game more than the Hades series. I don't know exactly why, but something about this game makes me want to keep playing it and spend hours on it. Don't get me wrong, I loved Hades, but Death Must Die is a better alternative in my book. Not because it's too simple or easy to play. Death Must Die is a really challenging and hard game. Also, I love the easy pacing of this game, to be fair, yes it's a bit repetitive right now but it's still an early access game and the developers are working on pumping out new updates and keep adding new things to the game. Looking forward to the new updates. | Game is Good. It would be better if there is a Chinese version. | Only 2 levels right now - This game is awesome and I have been playing it a lot. I reached the end of the second level though and realized there are no more. Now what? I have gotten 20 some hours out of this game but this took most of the enjoyment out it for me. Kind of a let down unfortunately. | Honestly. It is a quite decent Survivor-Like.
Problem is their updating cycles. Updates feel like they take ages,
and that update introducing Mastery Trees really kicked it out for me.

It limited all characters to playstyles you get from their respective Mastery Tree.
Forcing characters to be played with certain attributes,
which you maybe didn't even want.

You have almost an unlimited, boundless variety of items. Too much if you ask me.
Some giving stats that are useless or do not explain how they work.

For example (if I remember correctly) you had the Attribute ""+1 Power - Projectile""
Means all Abilities in the ""Power-Class"" get 1 Projectile.
One Power-Ability is an Aura and if I remember correctly it sadly didn't double the aura, no your ""Power-Ability"" needs to have a projectile so that your Attribute can function.

So often you get Items that are almost perfect but have that one trait that just goofs it all up.

Was fun the first few hours and I tried to find my fun after the update but I have lost my appetite.

And they released it 2023? What did we have like 2 updates that really changed some things?

I cannot recommend it anymore."

年近四十，上有老下有小的人是很难抽出整块时间坐在电脑前静静品味一个游戏，趁着这个春节，下定决心品尝这杯已经做好了多年的咖啡，于是力排众议顶住压力（感谢妻子的理解支持），在电脑前坐了一周indulging play，99小时40分通关了游戏，在深夜的屏幕前久久回味难以忘怀，震撼到无以复加，这注定是我人生难忘的精神之旅，也是我游戏编年史上最璀璨的坐标。

Larian在此呈现的，远非寻常意义上的电子游戏。
作为游戏，各种设计完美衔接，恰到好处；自由度高到令人发指，你可以做你自己；装备/等级/数据都是精心设计，兼顾了最大公约数；
作为音乐，Down by the river随河风飘扬成流动的叙事，I Want to Live在抉择时刻撕开灵魂，The Power见证胜利后紧握棱镜的双手，各类主题曲契合场景主题，已然挣脱媒介的桎梏，变成可以交互的交响诗，让我事后还反复专门聆听感慨；
作为剧本，这内容本身就是很精彩的小说，作者们绝对有撰写一部畅销魔幻小说的深厚功力。正义/邪恶，生存/死亡，杀戮/放生等人性和生命的主题引人哲思；如果去电影院是用2.5h欣赏了一部有深度的电影，那么在BG3，你是用100h+去体验有无奈有选择有善恶的跌宕魔幻人生。
我把游戏结束后在营地跟大家聊天的最后存档命名“Do not want to say Farewell”，一路走来，跟这堆朋友和战友同甘共苦，真的希望能一起继续生活下去，最后营地跟大家聊天穷尽选项，试图寻找更多的互动，特别是跟影心的七八次拥抱还留有数据的余温，舍不得说再见。但是Larian残忍又仁慈地让每个同行者带着伤痕继续前行——有人背负星辰远征，有人归于市井炊烟。这何尝不是最温柔的现实主义：所有相遇终究要归还给时光。
至此，我的龙与地下城故事已封存在剑湾的晚风中，有生之年，我还会再体验阿斯代伦和其它角色的一生。或许这正是CRPG的伟大之处：它允许我们在现实生活的夹缝里，体验无数个未曾活过的自己。

虽然也能看到一些对BG3批评改进的意见，但是瑕不掩瑜，个人认为有些地方确实可以再改进以方便玩家，有些意见却是因人而异而不能算作缺点和批评。
当你花了10-15h去学习这个游戏的机制和基本原理后跨过门槛，你真的无法想象Larian是如何创作出这样一部伟大作品的。如果这部作品无法被超越，是因为她确实太精湛也值得珍惜。如果被超越，那么游戏史上又多了另一颗明珠，也是我们的另一份礼物。
谢谢你，Larian。

A Love Letter to the Ninth Art – A Middle-Aged Player's 100-Hour Journey Through Baldur's Gate 3

As someone nearing forty, with both elderly parents and young children to care for, finding large chunks of time to sit in front of a computer and savor a game is no easy feat. This Spring Festival, I made up my mind to finally taste this cup of coffee that had been brewing for years. With the understanding and support of my wife (for which I am deeply grateful), I managed to carve out a week to indulge in uninterrupted play. After 99 hours and 40 minutes, I completed the game. Sitting in front of the screen late at night, I was left in awe, unable to shake the profound impact it had on me. This journey will undoubtedly remain one of the most unforgettable experiences of my life, a radiant milestone in my personal gaming history.

What Larian has created here is far from an ordinary video game.

As a game, every design element is seamlessly integrated, perfectly balanced. The freedom it offers is almost overwhelming—you can truly be yourself. The equipment, levels, and stats are meticulously crafted, catering to a broad spectrum of players.

As music, Down by the River drifts with the breeze, becoming a flowing narrative. I Want to Live tears at your soul during moments of decision, and The Power resonates as you grasp the prism in victory. Each theme song fits its scene so perfectly that it transcends the medium, transforming into an interactive symphonic poem that I found myself revisiting and reflecting on long after the game had ended.

As a novel, the content itself is a masterful piece of fantasy literature. The writers clearly possess the skill to craft a best-selling fantasy novel. Themes of justice versus evil, life versus death, and killing versus sparing provoke deep philosophical reflection. If watching a movie in a theater is like spending 2.5 hours appreciating a thought-provoking film, then Baldur's Gate 3 is like spending over 100 hours living a tumultuous, magical life filled with difficult choices and moral dilemmas.

I named my final save file in the camp, where I chatted with everyone before the end, ""Do Not Want to Say Farewell."" After journeying together, sharing both hardships and triumphs with these friends and comrades, I truly wished we could continue living together. I exhausted every dialogue option in the camp, searching for more interactions, especially with Shadowheart, whose seven or eight hugs still lingered with the warmth of data. I couldn’t bear to say goodbye. Yet, Larian, in their cruel yet merciful way, allowed each companion to move forward with their scars—some destined to carry the stars on their shoulders, others to return to the mundane life of hearth and home. This, perhaps, is the most tender form of realism: all encounters must eventually be returned to the passage of time.

Thus, my Dungeons & Dragons tale has been sealed in the evening breeze of the Sword Coast. In this lifetime, I will return to experience the lives of Astarion and other characters. Perhaps this is the greatness of CRPGs: they allow us, in the crevices of our real lives, to live countless versions of ourselves we never had the chance to be.

While there are some criticisms and suggestions for improvement regarding BG3, they are minor blemishes on an otherwise flawless gem. Some aspects could indeed be tweaked for player convenience, while others are subjective preferences rather than flaws.

Once you’ve spent 10-15 hours learning the game’s mechanics and fundamental principles, crossing that threshold, you can’t help but marvel at how Larian managed to create such a masterpiece. If this work remains unrivaled, it’s because it is truly exquisite and deserves to be cherished. If it is ever surpassed, then another jewel will have been added to the annals of gaming history, another gift for us all.

Thank you, Larian. | This is probably going to be one of the best games for the next decade, the voice acting is sublime and the writers seemed to have made deals with the devil in order to make such a good tale. 10/10 | The replayability of this game is insane, Larian did an amazing job giving us exactly what we wanted and maybe even a little more. This game has taken over my life and I love it so much, lol, and showing no signs of putting it down any time soon! | I have played this game for 6 hours (2h on character creator), never played this type of game before.. can say I am impressed and enjoying it a lot.

18 hours in the game: I think that I'm addicted. The stories are surprising and wholesome. I feel like a hero in this game, living for the good of the people.

50 hours: I finally finished act 1. And oh boy did I turn from good to evil with every step I took. I didn't mean to be... How was I supposed to know that pulling the wrong lever, I'll be catapulting a gnome to space. That wasn't my fault.

80 hours: Yes! Give me your gold. All the shiny trinkets you have. Give me your soul and all the power you hold. Give me more... MORE!

100 hours: How dare you look down on me, thinking like you could ever defeat me?! Hit me with all you got, it will never be enough!

120 hours: ... *only screams echo in the darkness* ...

130 hours: *Muahahaha-*
You may call me the blood queen,
but your agenda is also driven by greed.
The battle you lost, your advisors lied.
Your heroes are dead, your city is mine.
No evil as dark or vengeance as red,
have never been seen as I took the kings head. | I started playing this game a year and a few months after it was launched and immediately got into character creation which took me over an hour not to mention building my Dream Guardian. Since purchasing it at full price, I was weary to buy a game for 60 bucks, but it has been the best 60 bucks I've spent in a LONG time. 

The whole game itself doesn't hold your hand during the game, but it does help you build up your skills and learn how to play as you go which is great for those who haven't played CRPG turn based game before. I have basically played this nonstop since October to pass time and as you can see with my 527 hours on record, I absolutely LOVE this game. The options for responses and endings are endless. I'm thoroughly blown away with the voice acting and, yes, the mod options. There are many people who hate playing with mods, but to me it adds a lot to the game and enhances my game play experience making me want to play it more. I have done numerous campaigns and as of January 2025, I'm doing my 2nd durge campaign trying to play a somewhat evil character which is hard as I've cried from being evil to pixels haha. 

Overall, I think this game may be the best game I've ever played and I love how Larian and the VA's show their active participation in the community along with Larian giving us FREE updates and gives modders the toolkit. This company could've charged $100 or more for this game with the amount of work and thought put into it along with the (again) FREE updates, but they didn't. They have shown they care more for the player's experience and making a game that out beats other new games and certain *ahem developers AHEM Bethesda* by giving us a game that is completed at release (from what I've been told by other gamers who played this at release). I recommend this game to anyone who wants a rich, fulfilling game that doesn't have any extra catches outside the initial price."
76561198192893105,281640,The Banner Saga 2,0.0,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",0,"Круто! Очень интересное продолжение, виден рост в анимации, интересные сюжетные повороты. Сюжет пробивает на эмоции, как и первая часть, так держать! Графика и музыка на высоте, всё также захватывают. 
Понравились эмоции персонажей, новые части в сражении. Однозначно рекомендую! ♥ | Ворвавшись во вторую часть, я с ходу расшиб себе лоб о нововведение: испытания. Первое же испытание вынуждает нас познать боль и страдание случайностей, ведь нам нужно с одного AoE удара поразить трёх противников, которые должны примыкать друг к другу. Разработчики желают нам удачи в убеждении противников выстроиться «три в ряд», сидя за пуленепробиваемым стеклом, ведь они не могли не понимать, что ничего кроме желания их удушить подобные задания не могут вызывать? Я даже думал бросить с ходу, но внутренний мазохист победил, и, вооружившись артефактом +2 AGGRO и перезапустив испытание раз 10–15, я таки его одолел. 

И хорошо, что одолел, потому что испытания дают много renown, но знайте, что, хотя большая часть испытаний проходится довольно просто, проблемные ещё будут. К примеру, было испытание, где надо с помощью «Arc Lightning» поразить трёх противников. Снова веселье с «убеждением» противника, но мне один раз повезло, и на старте доброжелательный противник выстроился аккурат как мне надо. Каково же было моё удивление, когда задание не выполнилось после того, как я лупанул туда молнию. Потом лупанул вторую, и все трое умерли, но задание продолжило висеть! Забагованное #&*%$! Выполнить удалось лишь тогда, когда они выстроились после череды перемещений. 

Раздражающих нововведений я больше не встретил, но встретил бесполезные: баррикады. Я их даже в каких-то боях видел, но не видел ни разу, чтобы они хоть на что-то влияли. Абсолютно бесполезная ерунда. Другим сомнительным нововведением для меня стали таланты: их абсолютно неинтересно улучшать. Если я поднимал силу, то мой герой становился сильнее, тут я процентики туда-сюда добавляю — скучно. Вообще, прокачивать героев после 6 уровня совершенно неинтересно. А таланты можно вообще считать вредными, потому что они очень сильно влияют на восприятие боя. Если без них бой был строго определён: ты получал ровно то, что видел, то теперь туда влили кучу случайности, отсутствие которой, на мой взгляд, положительно выделяло боевую систему BS в первой части. 

Добавили много новых героев, у которых много разных новых способностей, что было несколько ошеломляюще поначалу, потому что глаза разбегались: кого в бой брать, почему, а что этот делает, а вот этот? Я ничего против новых героев не имею, но было бы куда лучше вводить их постепенно, а не вываливать на тебя пачками. Помогло то, что разработчики насильно разделили отряд на два и вынудили тебя использовать новых героев (учитывая, что то же самое они провернули в первой части, ничего лучше они придумать, похоже, не могут). 

Кстати, забавный момент с новой способностью. Способность Bolverk «Cull the Weak» у меня зачастую выдавала не тот результат, который я от неё ожидал. Т. е. урона было меньше, чем я предполагал. Я так до конца игры и не понял, в чём дело, и только после игры я нашёл на форуме такого же бедолагу, которому объяснили, что для применения способности третьего ранга ты должен использовать 3 willpower! Я прошёл две игры и не знал основы основ, я считал, что открытый с уровнем ранг замещает способность, и даже не догадывался, что я должен каждый раз платить за нужный мне ранг способности. Допускаю, что я где-то в обучении в первой части упустил этот момент, но как же, блин, это неинтуитивно! И таких моментов в игре, кстати, хватает. Нужно форумы штудировать, чтобы разобраться. 

Но можно и не разбираться, потому что игра не сложная. А вторая её часть ещё и проще первой. Причём значительно. У тебя убер-бойцы, ты ходишь и всех размазываешь, пока плебеи за едой ходят (я еду купил один раз в начале). Но играть всё-таки весело, равно как и интересно смотреть за развитием сюжета. По крайней мере один раз. Поэтому, несмотря на мой негатив выше, это всё ещё положительный отзыв. 

P. S. Разработчики в конце дают выбор без выбора. Как можно работать с отвратительным ублюдком по имени Rugga? За отсутствие возможности отрезать ему башку ставлю жирный минус. | Great story, interesting battle. Amazing game | Still my favorite game trilogy ever.

The story, the art, the gameplay, I love it all. | Внедрение новых фич в прокачку, меняющая стиль игры за героя, караван теперь может приносить пользу, докрученный интерфейс - отличие от первой части и определенно в лучшую сторону. Однако есть нерабочие костыли - войны, преграды, которые не дают никакого стратегического преимущества (враг на них чихать хотел и никогда в жизни не додумается сломать, а тыкать через них копейщакми или лучниками такое себе развлечение).
И всё-таки это уже игра не только с красивым визуалом и интересной историей, но и достойной боёвкой"
76561198192893105,485460,The Banner Saga 3,0.0,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",0,"Честно говоря, от ТБС3 очень смешанные ощущения. 

Последние пять часов трилогии, играл через силу, только из-за интересного сюжета предыдущих частей.

В плохом смысле, удивил финал:

Подвести итоги? - Нет.
Сделать классную анимацию под конец игры и наградить игрока мультиком с его любимыми героями? - Нет.
Сделать игровую статистику, или показать как мои решения повлияли на ход истории? - Нет.

Сценаристы вкинули что-то вроде ""Ну всьо - конец. Расходимся. Подробностей не будет."" 
Создалось впечатление, что закончил какую-то мини-игру, а не повесть на 30+ часов геймплея. 

Разрабы сами устали от своей же игры и хотели, это все дело, как можно быстрее закочнить. В итоге получили обрубок из истории и в конце ""Ну все норм будет короче не парьтесь."" 

А что именно будет? 

ТБС3 - Кидалово. | Honest review: 8.5/10

I really like this game.
Good story line, great art, kinda addictive to play, the game has a good unique combat style, plus the skills and items are interesting too.

Combat is turned base, you have armor that deflects damage from others strength/hp. You do as much damage as you have strength/hp. Which for some reason I didn't notice until The Banner Saga 2, about half way through.

To get the most out of this game, you should start with The Banner Saga 1. It continues the story line, plus you get to keep your party. Your choices matter from all the games previously.
I think they could make a 4th one, but seriously doubt they ever will. It doesn't leave ya on a cliff hanger, but i just really enjoyed it.

Game is solid enough to play at least twice, which makes since why its kinda short in the scheme of things.


The worst part of this game is how it saves.
If you do find it crashing on you, which has happened to me twice, just turn off the steam cloud saves. That will fix the problem.

If you like honest reviews, hit that like button and have a great day!!! | Как же КРУТО! Действительно приятное завершение столь интересной истории, которую ты прошёл с героями, погружаясь в сюжет. Именно в 3 части уже есть ощущение части себя с игрой и персонажами. Переживания, сочувствие и радость. Анимация, изображение фонов радовали на протяжении всего времени. Музыка всё также не даёт заскучать, дополняя погружение в мир, создаёт атмосфера в сражении и в кульминационных моментах. 
Огромное спасибо за столь замечательную игру! Навсегда будет в моём сердечке ♥ | Слишком много технических проблем, несмотря на маленький масштаб игры. Особенно когда играешь в режиме выживания, приходится перезагружить игру после багов, и режим выживания приходится начинать с начала, так как там ограничено количество перезапусков. Разработчики в общем не доделали игру. 
А если бы не технические проблемы, игра хорошая. | My review is with regards to the trilogy as a whole.

I'm not going to talk about mechanics, bugs or the story.  There are many other reviews on those topics.

Holistically, the game is just boring.  The characters you encounter rarely speak and it's hard to make them interesting.  The caravan composition (clansmen, varl, fighters) is just a resource meter that doesn't play any part at all.  For a game touted for its storytelling, it is just boring to follow along when the vast majority of the cast lack any sense of development."
76561198192893105,899770,Last Epoch,15.7,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG",0,"There used to be a time when a game would be released in it's 1.0 foundational state, and it was fundamentally considered [i]complete[/i]. It meant that all the gameplay and story elements were in place, and any ancillary content could be added in at a future date. 
This could include extra story elements, items, dungeons, expansions, patches, and DLC etc.

Apparently, not anymore.

I waited for years to see Last Epoch exit early access and finally hit that glorious 1.0 release.
I even waited another year for the game to have all the creases ironed out.

So, I purchased the game, and was having a decent time. 
...that is, until the main quest storyline just 'stopped'.
Now to be clear, I don't mean it [i]concluded[/i]. I mean, it just 'stops' half-way through the story, and then you're left to go do mindless end-game farming. 
I genuinely thought my game was bugged and that the main quest wasn't showing. But a bit of research had me find out that the devs didn't think to complete the most basic element of a game - the story, before a 1.0 launch.

And what's worse, is that people just defend this type of practise?

Imagine if I sold you a book, but left the back half completely blank, and I told you ""I'll write the rest some time in the future. Not really sure when though""
Not a sequel, but I'll finish the first book at some indeterminate time in the future.
Nebulous much?

Or imagine you sit down at a restaurant, and the waiter brings you only half of your meal, and says ""We only made the first half - even though you paid for all of it. We'll eventually cook you the second half, at some point. Just not today. But you can have dessert! We have loads of dessert!""
Ludicrous. And yet, that's the standard that is being accepted more and more nowadays.

Sure, Last Epoch has some great elements to it. Genuinely.
Character building is cool. Loot filters in the game are top-notch. Visuals can be great.
But presentation means little when the foundational product is incomplete - [b]at full price[/b].

Ridiculous. 
Truthfully, I feel cheated. And looking at the 2025 road-map, where story content will be added 'some time later', I realise I should've just waited until the far off future when the game price will have likely dropped. 
Cheaper price for an 'actual' finished product.

This just feels like a lazy rush-to-market strategy, and I'd refund if I could, however it took me way more than the allotted refund time to know that the story would just 'cut off'. Which seems scummy.

Also, apparently even one of the game devs thinks you're being too unreasonable in expecting a 1.0 full release of a game to be, y'know, [i]'fully completed'[/i]. As he said that the 1.0 distinction of the game is ""Fairly Arbitrary"".
I call major bs on that one. 
You don't get to redefine what ""Full Release"" means, just to account for your lack of complete content. 

Furthermore, the endgame content, while nice in theory, honestly just boils down to this:

- Click a big floaty island in space.
- Now click on a smaller floaty island in space and fight a bunch of enemies.
- Do 10-20 more of these smaller floaty islands - with the same grinding of enemies.
- Now you've unlocked a boss fight.
- Fight said boss
- Click another big floaty island in space and repeat.

It's boring, and in no way a good placeholder for a completed and memorable story.

If the game was completed, I would've looked back on the game and thought ""Yeah wow. That was a nice experience. Not [i]the best I've ever played[/i], but nice. And that's worth a recommend.""

As it stands, I think you should stay away from the game for another year (or possibly two) - as of this review date, and reassess the state of the game at that time.

Until then, don't perpetuate crappy business standards - or they'll become normalised and you'll be the only one paying for it. | 离线模式要联网玩，联机体验极差，未入手的建议先看看视频和评测观望。 | The game isn't fun. This is a combination of skills that feel unimpactful, low monster density, overall slow game pace, low difficulty, and an endgame that encourages you to just rush through to the objective as fast as you can rather than kill anything, among other reasons.

Most of the praise around this game will be about ""potential"" rather than what's actually there. If you've played or followed this game since the beta you should know that the developers have done absolutely nothing to demonstrate they can ever deliver on this potential. What's actually implemented is very bare-bones, often buggy, and not fun/interesting. Will the game be good eventually? Maybe, but unlikely. And should you spend money on a game that isn't good right now? Absolutely not.

There are great ARPGs out there, this isn't one of them. | Very funnnnnn. This game was a good arpg with nice class and skill. The Skill tree node is very good and fun to make build with. The game itself is casual, not hard to gear up or level up, newbie friendly and easy to use filter. It was more casual than poe but not too casual like d3, grind end game gear need min max crafting which make it not too boring. 10/10 | 无语了，这主线剧情也太长了，而且不做还不行，谁玩这类游戏是冲着剧情来的？学下暗黑3多好，这剧情跑图太折磨"

Craft lets you get around a little easier at times, but strength can just steamroll everything, and if a caster has to PVP a strength character, they lose. The end game is nothing but luck. I spent nine rounds on the crown, and only twice did the command spell work.

Counter-Strike: Source (CS: Source) is the definitive version of one of the most iconic tactical shooters ever created. Built on the Source engine, it brought stunning graphics, refined mechanics, and an immersive experience that kept players engaged for years. It improved upon its predecessor, Counter-Strike 1.6, and laid the foundation for future games in the series, including Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Here's why CS: Source remains a perfect 10/10 for fans of competitive gaming.

Why It’s a Must-Play
🔫 Precise Gunplay
At the core of CS: Source is its tight and rewarding gun mechanics. Every weapon in the game feels unique, with its own recoil patterns and handling characteristics. This precision-driven combat is one of the key factors that makes CS: Source such a compelling competitive experience. From the M4A4's controlled spray to the AWP's one-shot kills, every engagement requires skill and accuracy.

🌍 Map Design & Tactical Depth
The iconic maps like Dust 2, Inferno, and Nuke are where the game shines brightest. Each map is meticulously designed to offer a balance of tactical positions, choke points, and strategic opportunities. Whether you're defending bomb sites or pushing through tight corridors, the map design fosters deep teamwork and careful planning.

💥 Gameplay Mechanics
CS: Source features smooth, fluid movement, making it easy to peek around corners, hold angles, and strafe while shooting. The buy system gives players the freedom to choose their preferred weapons and gear, while round-based gameplay forces teams to be efficient with their resources and execute well-planned strategies.

🎮 Vibrant Community & Modding Support
The modding community for CS: Source has been incredibly active, creating a wealth of custom content from maps to skins to even entirely new game modes. This extends the life of the game by offering nearly endless ways to enjoy the experience. The server browser lets players dive into unique community-run servers, making every session feel fresh and exciting.

🎨 Improved Visuals
Powered by the Source engine, CS: Source delivered a massive graphical leap from its predecessors, offering realistic lighting, better textures, and advanced physics. These improvements gave the game a more immersive and polished feel, while the physics engine introduced interactive objects and destructible environments, adding a layer of depth to gameplay.

What Makes It a 10/10
CS: Source isn’t just a game; it’s a tactical masterpiece that’s stood the test of time. Its emphasis on team coordination, strategy, and individual skill is unmatched. Whether playing with friends or random players, the experience fosters a strong sense of community and competition, making each match feel meaningful. The team-based objectives – like bomb planting/defusal – combined with tight, tactical combat is a dynamic experience that few shooters can replicate.

The longevity of CS: Source is a testament to how well it was designed. While newer titles in the series (like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive) have taken inspiration from it, the smoothness of the gameplay, iconic maps, and endless customization options keep it relevant in the competitive FPS scene.

If you’re a fan of shooters and haven’t experienced CS: Source, you’re missing out on one of the most influential and well-rounded tactical shooters ever made. It’s a game that offers both depth and accessibility, making it suitable for casual players, yet still offering enough challenge for the competitive elite. CS: Source is a timeless classic—pure, competitive, and still as enjoyable today as it was when it first released."

76561198082086866,24740,Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box,0.9,Racing,0,"Rating: 9/10

Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box is a revolutionary arcade racing game that takes the Burnout series into a free-roaming open world. Released in 2008 by Criterion Games, the game offers fast-paced, destructive racing with an emphasis on stunts and crazy crashes, all set in a vast and dynamic city. The Ultimate Box includes the base game as well as all the downloadable content (DLC) released up until that point, making it the definitive version for those who want to experience the entire game.

What Works Well?
🚗 Open-World Racing
The game’s open-world structure sets it apart from other racing games at the time. Rather than following a linear progression, players can freely drive around the fictional Paradise City, discovering races, challenges, and events. The world is vast, lively, and packed with dynamic content, making it feel alive and exciting.

💥 Destruction and Crashes
Burnout is known for its over-the-top crashes, and Paradise delivers on that in spades. The game has a Crashing system that encourages players to drive recklessly, with spectacular visual effects when you crash into other cars, barriers, or objects. Burnouts are highly satisfying and one of the game’s most memorable features.

🏁 Variety of Race Types and Events
The game offers a wide variety of events that are not limited to traditional races. Players can engage in Road Rage (taking out opponents), Marked Man (escaping pursuers), Stunt Runs, and more. Each event type presents its own challenge, and the more you play, the more you unlock new events, keeping things fresh and exciting.

🎶 Fantastic Soundtrack
The soundtrack of Burnout Paradise is a crowd-pleaser, featuring a varied mix of rock, punk, and electronic music, with tracks that fit perfectly with the high-energy racing. The dynamic soundtrack also changes depending on the events you’re engaged in, further immersing you in the experience.

What Could Be Better?
❌ Controls May Feel Loose to Some
While the game’s arcade-style driving can be thrilling, some players may find the controls a little loose compared to more simulation-based racers. Steering is forgiving, and the game allows you to perform wild drifts, but it may not be as satisfying for players who prefer a more precise racing experience.

❌ No Split-Screen Multiplayer
One major downside for local multiplayer fans is the lack of split-screen racing. While Burnout Paradise offers online multiplayer, the absence of local co-op or versus racing may be a dealbreaker for those who enjoy couch multiplayer.

❌ Aging Graphics
Though the game looked fantastic at launch, the graphics can appear dated when compared to newer racing games. While the art style is still charming, the textures and vehicle models may not impress modern gamers who are accustomed to hyper-realistic visuals.

Conclusion
Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box is a masterpiece of arcade racing that delivers adrenaline-pumping fun and creative destruction. The open-world format, spectacular crashes, and variety of events make it one of the most entertaining racing games of its time. Though it may not have the sharpest visuals or the most precise controls, its fast-paced, chaotic gameplay more than makes up for it. If you love open-world racing or are a fan of the Burnout series, Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box is an absolute must-play.

Rating: 9/10 – A chaotic, fun-filled arcade racer that's still a blast to play today. 🚗💥 | Take me down to the paradise city where the grass green and the girls are pretty!
Very well done, destruction everywhere, and a wonderful arcade racing game | GOAT of arcade racing games, loads of race types and awesome open-world map to explore with different objectives to get.
Note: for this game the servers are down, so if you're looking to keep track of friends' scores/times and race on multiplayer, getting the Remastered version of the game would be the play. | This fuckin game is one of the best ever made, god given one would say, produced by EA? The fallen angel of the gaming industry. Yeah its good, ive finished it like 3 times on various consoles and other media and all i can say is that the soundtrack alone is worth a play, its just so damn good, wish that more Burnout was released since this game is just so damn addictive. 10/10 christ himself would come down and play it then fist bump you | This game was so fun when it came out. Too bad they don't sell this version anymore."

差不多7年前，我的小学同学就发现了这款大作，那时手机版还没有心动，只有应用商店里的1.2版本，对于当时的我们，手机版1.2只有两个滑轮键控制移动和瞄准，并且局域网联机方便，十分益于上手。我和几个哥们一放假就聚在一起play。当时我们卡在世纪之花这个boss，就聚在学校小花园商量战术，没想到我自己直接单挑过了，还有我第一次打过肉山，是拿蜜蜂手雷和它同归于尽，真的很怀念1.2陪伴我的时光，之后1.2下架，国服代理，为了玩上1.3的泰拉，我在好游快爆苦苦地种玉米（当时可以以此换取游玩资格，否则就要花钱），没想到最后发现还需要早起抢购资格，而我当时可能在上学，没有抢到，努力直接白费。我和同学只能在网上寻找那些还没下架1.2的网站继续玩。
从小学到了初中，以前玩泰拉的朋友各奔东西，但我对泰拉的热情依然不减，后来出了手游国际版我便立即下载，顶着看不懂的英文，摸索1.3的机制，专家模式掉落的装备我都从未见过，新鲜感和好奇心油然而生，初中期间我也找到了一两个一起玩的，使我不至于太孤独。疫情之前，我从来都是只玩手机版泰拉，知道疫情上网课，我终于有机会玩上电脑版了。当时的我对电脑并不精通，也不知道steam是什么东西，于是就在360浏览器直接搜泰拉瑞亚，经过一天的寻找，我也是下到了盗版泰拉（当时我也不知道正版要买）就这么在电脑上再通关了一遍普通模式，但这次没有任何人陪伴，只有我一个人。
终于到了高中，我了解了正规的steam渠道，在打折期间花18块钱买了正版泰拉，为童年补了票，高二认识了几个志同道合的同学，一起玩了灾厄，也是乐在其中。如今，我即将成人，步入大学生活，但我的泰拉之旅还在继续，玩了十几年游戏，只有泰拉瑞亚给我的印象最深，给我带来的乐趣最多，对于陪伴了我78年的老伙计，打多少星已经不重要了，真没想到我能写这么多，回顾了一遍我的童年，我的眼里有些模糊。 | --{ Gráficos }---

Great bosses, fun stat progression, sandbox building, etc. Highly recommend. | Очень классная игра. Давно играю в него спустя с мобильной версии террарии. Когда перешёл на пк версию, то было ещё веселее и приятнее. Жаль конечно что старые мобы, вещи, боссы пропали с телефонной версии, но так приятно о них вспоминать и проходить их в тмодлорде. Люблю эту игру | The game is fabulous, but a bit more handholding at the very beginning would be nice, because the moment the game started, I had no idea what I was supposed to do or how I was supposed to build anything or use my inventory, so the first few minutes were horrendous, and I was dying quite a lot, which reminded me why I instantly deleted this game many years ago when trying to play it for the very first time. This time around I decided to keep at it, and the first 10–15 hours were slow, but then I got the hang of it, and the game consumed me to the point where I lost track of time and racked up 100 hours just completing the main story and hunting for some achievements.

It is however an action game, and it does that really well with lots of action, dialogue that fits the setting perfectly and the pacing is good too.

never really rises to the power fantasy one wants when playing a space marine game, but the combat puzzle is actually pretty fun, requiring some positioning and resource management. this pre-dates doom 2013 so the glory kills aren't invulnerable, which really makes things 'damned if you do, damned if you don't', though the Rage mechanic feels made just right where it's not a crutch but it's there when you need it.
looks just right for a 2011 game as well, runs well, pre-borderless windowed but oh well.

first and foremost, dead game. has been dead for a while, and games like this tend to need players to unlock its best gameplay.

but the most important thing that holds this back is the bots. i've played countless RTS games against AI and the likes. there are plenty of RTS games where there also is little to no players, but i enjoy them because i can still play a typical game against an AI opponent. in this game, there is no RTS commander, and therefore basically no reason to play because almost everything this game is relies on that.

RIP to a real one | Nuclear Dawn 2?"
76561198082086866,3830,Psychonauts,0.0,Action,0,"A platformer with its share of flaws, but oozing with charm thanks to its characters and humor. Some bugs get in the way of the enjoyment, like a boss where on a latter phase the camera glitched out to the point where I literally could not see my character on the screen. I had to start the boss over in order to fix it and it happened twice more. Similar bugs occur throughout the game. Still, this is one of those titles I feel every platformer fan should play through at least once. I only wish it had better Steam Deck support. | It surprisingly holds up great even now. The story itself is fairly basic, but there's fun world building and a whole lot of really unique characters. The animation is very solid and not stiff like one would expect from that era. Each mind you get to explore has a personal style themed to it and they explore wildly different ideas. Even some fun way of trying out your new powers with the scavenger hunt.

The only negative I have would be the mechanical side, movement and actions can feel clunky and not always working properly. And the audio quality not being fully consistent with some voice lines.

It will be interesting to see the improvements made in Psychonauts 2. You can really feel that this game was made with love and dedication, it oozes charm. | çok eğlenceli sıra dışı bir yapım TR yama da kurdum akıp gidiyor , çünkü az ingilizce yetmiyor oyun için kısmi platform oyunu ama hikayesi esprileri gayet ayarında yapılmış tavsiye ederim | Funny, quirky adventure.
Although the later stages might be annoying, the level designs are really fascinating.
This game has been on my backlog for almost 8 years; finally, I played it from beginning to end. | Psychonauts is a great game that has some of the best writing in the Video Game history BUT time also hasn't been very kind to this game in terms of control and combat.

Firstly, the games story, writing, voice acting, etc is all top notch and it has some of the best environmental storytelling out there (with exception to the sequel). Raz (the main protagonist) is a fantastic character and the voice job by Horvits is top notch. 

Graphically this game doesn't hold up too well and it's not for the art style. While the Art Style can definitely be divisive personally I think it's fine. It's later polished up and I think looks way better in the sequel but here it's fine if not a bit ugly at times. However the art style mixed with original xbox graphics and low resolution cut-scenes can make parts of the game just look bad and dated.

The real part that makes this game not be a masterpiece is the combat and to a lesser extent the movement. The combat is clunky and tough to get the hang of (another thing fixed in the sequel). The movement is fine but the Levitation ability is completely overpowered which while fun completely negates a lot of the platforming challenge.

The games world and main hub (whispering rock psychic summer camp) is charming and fun to explore but the first levels or minds can feel very tutorialized making the start of the game one of the weakest if you're not fully exploring the hub. The game really picks up halfway when the story pivots to its main objective (not to spoil anything) and takes you away from the camp to really go into the best minds in the game. Sadly the final level is a mess. It's not this super insane challenging level it got over time but it's way tougher than the rest of the game and the bad and clunky combat makes it a frustrating chore.

Overall you play the original Psychonauts for the incredible story, fun word, and cleaver writing and not the combat/platforming. If you do pick this up (which I recommend if you're interested) be prepare to endure some dated gameplay to get to the parts that made this game a cult classic.

8/10 - Infinite"
76561198082086866,202200,Galactic Civilizations® II: Ultimate Edition,0.0,"Indie, Strategy",0,"One of the best civ-esque 4X games in a space setting that in some aspects has still not been surpassed in 2025.


Pros:

+ All 12 races have unique tech trees, AI personalities, diplomacy text and more.
+ Chess-engine type dynamic AI that has not been surpassed in any other 4X game and plays by the same rules as you.
+ Truly impactful galactic event system that keeps each game fresh.
+ Lots of different strategies to excel in, from influence, economy, diplomacy to war.
+ Actually really nice soundtrack for a 4X game.
+ Ability to create and download custom races and ship styles. (You can totally set up all Star Trek races).
+ A lot of content after 3 expansions, both in mechanics and in campaigns.
+ Well balanced and bug free after many years of community patches.
+ Runs on any computer and looks alright if you max everything out.

Cons:

- it's a game from 2008, expect some really shitty CGI and a lot of videos and UI elements to look a little low-res on modern resolutions.
- No in-game encyclopedia leaves you looking through the included manual, ""Community Edition Guide"" and old forum threads to figure out the intricacies of gameplay mechanics as the game came out before community game wikis became commonplace. 
- Default ship designs are lacking, you are forced to use the ship builder to make optimized ship designs, this can be a chore and will lead to ugly designs if you can't bother to take the time to artfully place the modules.
- Ship designer does not let you modify the auto-generated designs.
- Suffers from the common ""Space is empty"" curse. No actual terrain, lots of uncolonizable planets and just deep space that is not fun or very distinctive either visually or strategically.
- Compared to stuff like Stellaris, planets are mostly samey as well.
- Civ4 style stacked combat system that does not really care for positioning outside of starbases.

 
Overall I would recommend it just for the very tight gameplay loop and good AI leading to very interesting gameplay. | O jogo é desafiador e bem completo. Cada raça tem vantagens e desvantagens e trazem caminhos distintos para a vitória. | Yet another fun 4x game franchise.

Check it out!"
76561198082086866,64000,Men of War: Assault Squad,0.0,Strategy,0,"Its a broken game, half the time units don't respond to commands, enemies often glitch out and don't attack, the camera is buggy and doesn't respond just the same, graphics are full of glitches with shadows glitching as you move the camera around, I'm just perplexe at the low quality of this game and the apparent enthusiasm around it. It's worse than Sudden Strike 4 and that says a lot, at least I had the patience to play 3 missions with the latter before wanting to throw my keyboard out of the window. | Campaign completely impossible. Number of enemies is greater than the number of your bullets, and bodies disappear instantly making it impossible to loot, enemy tanks kill your tank with one shot while your tank can't kill enemy tanks from the front. | So here's the thing I've played several Men of War games already right like the older, classic ones and I even played Faces of War which as far as I know came out even before the Men of War series truly became a thing right. In those older Men of War games I thought the difficulty get annoying at points but you could still win either by spamming shit out until you overran the enemy defenses or by getting a big enough cannon and blowing shit up from far away. Faces of War was the only one where I thought the difficulty was annoyingly stupid and felt like I had to save scum to get past the levels which is why I ended up not finishing that game and just wrote a review when I thought I was comfortable enough with it. Now here's Men of War Assault Squad and it is, for me at least, pretty much a direct copy of Faces of War.

+The graphics look wonderful. Sounds are great. Controls are great as well, easy to use. The game ran without any issues, any crashes nothing.
+3 missions each for the Americans, Germans, Commonwealth, Soviets and Japanese. Each mission even on the easy difficulty can be very challenging and can take up to an hour to beat. In the campaings generally you're just put on a map with a ton of places to capture and you're given command points with which you can buy more units. Capture more points, unlock better units, buy them, use them, capture every point on the map and win the mission. Repeat for every faction, every mission.
+Tons of units, tons of vehicles, in the classic Men of War fashion not only are you ordering your units around like a real time strategy game but you can take direct control of them as well. Bought yourself a Panther, Tiger, Sherman, some random Japanese tank, maybe a half track full on infantry, maybe one of those late war German Goliath remote detonated bombs you can just take direct control of them, drive them around, shoot whatever. You can take direct control of single infantry units as well, run around with a machine gun in your hand if you want.
+Another thing I love about the Men of War series in general is the damage models on the vehicles. Your little AT gun is up against a Tiger and you can't pen it? Just shoot its tracks and immobilize it. You're in the Tiger and you saw that AT gun? Just gun down the crew and order your own infantry to man the gun, this way you'll capture the enemy AT gun for free. You're idk in a Sherman and you fired a shell at an enemy tank aside from the tracks you can damage its gun, turret, hull, engine and obviously blow it up instantly with a well placed shot. If it hasn't suffered some serious critical damage it can be repaired and put back into action.

-In pretty much every single mission you're going up against well entrenched enemy forces with a very small army of your own. If that wasn't enough the enemy can and will call in reinforcements just like you so every now and then you'll have a sudden wave of enemy infantry charging and recapturing the points you already took some other times they'll send random tanks towards you which can cause quite the headache. Running out of points to buy more units and having your own units massacred by tons of machine guns and tanks is pretty common. Even on easy. I'm not a good player sure but holy fuck do you really have to make me run across an open field covered with 3 different heavy artillery guns, 3-4 other really damn big AT guns, infantry all over the place... I send my most heavily armored vehicle in, AT guns and the artillery fucks it up. I send the infantry in well guess what its an open field they're crossing and at the end is a bunch of sand bags, machine guns, AT guns, artillery and tons of infantry why would they ever succeed in that situation? I send both the vehicles and the infantry at the same time, combined arms warfare shit and EVERYONE dies. I'm not joking the only reason I won one of the missions is because some enemy AT and artillery pieces friendly fired each other so I got to cross the open field and capture the point with just overwhelming numbers. It was silly. This was the first mission in the German campaing. On easy. Again call me stupid if you want but fuck me this game is so hard that I failed the American training mission against the Japanese several times. I had to switch from normal to easy, fail again and THEN I won the training mission. Moved to the Japanese campaing, got fucked on the first mission. German campaing, got fucked on the first mission still won by pure luck but that should not have worked.

If it wasn't for the absurd difficulty I think I'd enjoy it a lot. I mean I still did enjoy it but definitely nowhere near as much as I could have. Winning too easily, crushing the enemy isn't fun. Losing too easily, being crushed isn't fun. It has to be in the middle where it feels like luck or a really good decision in a bad moment turned the tide you know? Thats not here, its just an uphill battle and while coming out on top does feel good after fighting against a shit ton of enemies its not the same kind of fun you'd get, not the same kind of good feeling you'd get from a better, more balanced mission right? I'm pretty sure I gave Faces of War a thumbs up which, looking back on it after a long time, was probably not a good idea. Similar to Faces of War I want to give this game a thumbs up too they were both incredibly difficult, overwhelming and annoying but the core gameplay is so cool that I wanna ignore it but I did that mistake on the Faces of War review and I feel bad about it and I think I should change it to a negative one instead so I'm gonna learn from my mistake and just give this one a negative review instead. Which isn't fair I don't think I wish I could give a mixed rating but I can't. The core gameplay is really fun and nice but the campaings feel incredibly unfair to the point where it makes the entire thing annoying. Either way negative it is, we'll see if Assault Squad 2 is any better when I someday get around to reviewing that one. | Советую покупать сразу men of war assault squad 2.

Overview: ORION: Prelude is a first-person shooter and survival game developed by Spiral Game Studios. Set in a sci-fi universe, the game offers players the chance to fight off waves of enemies, mine for resources, and explore alien landscapes. As the ""Prelude"" in the title suggests, this is part of a larger series that focuses on cooperative survival and exploration. Players can engage in solo or multiplayer modes, with the game offering various environments and enemies to battle.

Gameplay: At its core, ORION: Prelude is a mix of survival, exploration, and action. The game features dynamic combat, where players fight off hordes of enemies with a variety of weapons and tools. Players can also mine resources to improve their weapons, build turrets, and upgrade their defenses.

The game supports both solo and multiplayer modes, with the co-op experience being a major highlight. In multiplayer, players can team up to face increasingly difficult waves of enemies. This cooperative play adds a layer of strategy, as players need to work together to survive the onslaught.

The combat itself is relatively standard for a first-person shooter, with a variety of weapons available, including guns, explosives, and melee tools. However, the AI can sometimes feel lackluster, and the enemy design doesn’t offer much variety or challenge in the long run.

Graphics and Performance: ORION: Prelude features fairly basic graphics for a modern first-person shooter. The environments are passable but not particularly impressive, with alien landscapes that can feel repetitive. The textures and character models are simple, and while they’re functional, they don't stand out visually. The game’s visual style is somewhat dated, even by the standards of games released around its time.

In terms of performance, ORION: Prelude runs decently on most systems, but it can struggle with optimization at times. Some players report frame rate drops or occasional stuttering, especially in more intense combat scenarios or when there are many enemies on screen. While the game isn't demanding on hardware, the performance can still be inconsistent, which may detract from the experience.

Audio Design: The audio in ORION: Prelude is serviceable but not remarkable. The sound effects for weapons, explosions, and enemies are decent but don’t have a strong impact. The soundtrack is fairly generic, with ambient sci-fi tunes that don’t add much to the atmosphere. While the audio isn't distracting, it doesn’t elevate the experience either. There’s no significant voice acting, which could have added personality and immersion to the game’s characters and story.

Challenges: ORION: Prelude offers a moderate challenge, especially in survival mode. As players progress through waves of enemies, the difficulty increases, requiring players to manage resources, defend positions, and upgrade their gear. However, the lack of diverse enemy types or complex AI behavior can make the game feel repetitive over time.

The game can become quite grindy, as players need to farm resources, mine, and continuously upgrade their weapons and defenses. While this can be fun for a while, it may begin to feel monotonous, especially if playing solo.

Final Thoughts: ORION: Prelude is an ambitious, yet somewhat flawed, survival shooter. While the cooperative gameplay and resource management offer some fun, the overall experience can feel repetitive and lacks the depth needed to keep players fully engaged. The game’s dated graphics, lack of enemy variety, and inconsistent performance hold it back from being a standout title in the genre.

Pros:

Fun cooperative multiplayer with friends
Resource management and upgrading add strategic elements
Some decent combat mechanics
Fairly easy to jump into for casual play
Cons:

Dated graphics and repetitive environments
Weak AI and lackluster enemy variety
Performance issues, including frame drops and stuttering
Lack of story or deep character development
Can become grindy and repetitive over time
ORION: Prelude offers a decent co-op survival experience but struggles to stand out in the crowded first-person shooter market. It’s enjoyable for short sessions with friends, but the lack of long-term depth and technical issues may prevent it from becoming a lasting favorite. | This is the cheapest way to have a blast on steam and its great when you have no internet because you can still play you defend a generator in ever increasing in difficulty dino waves with weapons you unlock yes there are vehicles like tanks bot and chopper and even a speed cycle | Worth every penny.

Игра выделяется своей необычной концепцией, где одна команда играет за людей, а другая — за динозавров. Это добавляет интересный элемент разнообразия, так как каждый класс имеет уникальные способности и стиль игры.

Геймплей достаточно динамичный и увлекательный, особенно если вам нравятся шутеры с элементами стратегического взаимодействия. Люди могут использовать различные виды оружия и оборудования, а динозавры имеют уникальные атаки, которые заставляют играть на разных уровнях сложности в зависимости от того, за какую сторону вы играете. Атмосфера игры хорошо передает чувство выживания и угрозы, когда на вас нападают гигантские хищники.

Однако, игра страдает от некоторых технических проблем и однообразия. Графика на момент выпуска выглядела неплохо, но с годами она устарела, а оптимизация оставляла желать лучшего. Баланс между людьми и динозаврами тоже не всегда идеален, и некоторые классы динозавров оказываются сильнее других.

Плюсы
✅ Интересная концепция: Игра сочетает шутер с элементами выживания и уникальным противостоянием людей и динозавров.
✅ Динамичный геймплей: Быстрые сражения и необходимость работать в команде делают игру увлекательной.
✅ Разнообразие классов: Каждый класс, будь то человек или динозавр, имеет свои особенности, что добавляет стратегии.
✅ Хорошая атмосфера: Атмосферные карты и звуковое сопровождение создают ощущение настоящего выживания.

Минусы
❌ Старая графика: Визуальная составляющая на момент выпуска была неплохой, но теперь выглядит устаревшей.
❌ Проблемы с оптимизацией: Игра может тормозить на некоторых системах, даже если они соответствуют минимальным требованиям.
❌ Несбалансированные классы: Некоторые динозавры могут быть слишком сильными, что создаёт дисбаланс в игре.
❌ Ограниченное количество карт: Несмотря на разнообразие в плане классов, количество карт и режимов игры ограничено, что приводит к однообразию.

[i]Dwarfs!?[/i] qu'est-ce que c'est ? C'est un petit jeu au concept tout simple avec des nains. Le but est de s'enrichir le plus possible en un temps donné en minant divers minerais, et pour se faire on doit ""guider"" nos nains en traçant leurs chemins. Mais tracer leurs chemins coûte de l'or, donc à moins de viser une zone particulière, on va les laisser creuser à leur guise...et c'est là qu'il va falloir rattraper leurs boulettes, parce que si nous nous voyons que telle ou telle cavité est pleine d'eau ou de lave, eux ne le voient pas... C'est à nous de bloquer le torrent d'eau ou la coulée de lave, ou d'envoyer nos guerriers poutrer les ennemis/boss libérés par nos creuseurs.

Мы даже поиграли некоторое время втроем (я, жена и дочь). Но какая в игре цель, я не понял. Собрать деньги, что бы купить шмотки? Зачем, ведь они не дают никаких преимуществ, только внешний вид. Убить 1000 монстров чтобы получить мощно умение или способность? Дык нет же, прокачка персонажа отсутствует. Пройти подземелье и убить босса, чтобы войти в следующую локацию? Опять мимо - все немногочисленые карты доступны сразу и почти ничем друг от друга не отличаются. Зачем покупал полный доступ не знаю. | Such a nice concept... but sadly ruined by huge netcode issues.

An online game of Dungeonland is often unplayable due to lag. Your character will teleport, and sometimes several seconds of action will be missing and then happen instantly, making you dead.

This happens even when you are playing with a friend living near you... in some huge city where the internet is fast no less. So I can safely say it's not my hardware, but the game which is broken.

There are many good ideas in this game, but sadly when a technical issue makes your multiplayer game unplayable in multiplayer, it invalidates everything you've done.

Can we dream for a fix? Sadly, it's unlikely to happen at this point. But who knows?

Unless that unlikely improvement happens, avoid this game. It's kinda worse than the game just being bad on all levels, because it feels like we're missing on a pretty fine experience here... | A unique little game made by Paradox, doomed by not being supported anymore.

Now, don't get me wrong. The only reason why you would want to buy and subsequently play this game is if you had a bunch of friends who also want to do so. As it is, the game is dead. There's very few people who still play and since this game is absolutely horrible with AI (and even if it had decent AI, it wouldn't be fun for long) you'll have a bad time.

The gameplay involves you either dungeoncrawling through a fun, cartoony dungeon filled with monsters and traps while playing one of three classes (who also split up into 3 specializations). All of those have a very different role: The warrior is clearly the tank, the rogue is perfect for annihilating big foes and the mage is support and AoE damage.

The group dynamic between the 3 players is great and lots of fun, but it's way more fun to be the 4th one: The Dungeon Maestro. In this gamemode you get to direct the dungeon! You can use spells to actively harm the players, you can place monsters and even minibosses to create obstacles or make already premade monsterpacks even scarier and at the end you even get to control a huge Boss yourself!

You can take different kinds of ""cards"" (which are either monsterpacks or spells) with you, and the variety and combo-potential is pretty cool. Almost all of the 22 hours I have put into this game are from this mode, aside from farming for some hero items via an exploit (which has been fixed though). I'd still be playing it, if other people were to, too.

As it stands, the game isn't really playable anymore. If you do have 3 friends and a bunch of free time, get a 4 pack. Now. The game's tons of fun and very unique, and you'll laugh your asses off (while cursing the wretched Dungeon master, of course)! 

If you do not though...Don't bother. Paradox, if you ever revive a game, do a Dungeonland 2 and support it like crazy! | Abandonend Game without Servers. DO NOT BUY. A shame that there is no disclaimer on the store page that its abandoned.

2/18/2017 Edit: Some of my outfit/platoon mates gave me some ideas as to what to put for the 10 things as I could only think of about 4 on my own :P 
So thanks to them to make this review entirely possible!

3/1/2017 Edit 2: a few more tips for you are   
1) dont run infront of your allies that are shooting, go behind them so you stay out of their line of fire.   
2) use the terain around you for cover.  
3) if your a Heavy Assault turn you shield on when entering cover, even if your not being shot at. reason is this is a CLIENT side game if you can see them, you can shoot them. so if your in cover they may still see you out of cover for a short time after because they havent recieved the info from you yet. so use the addage of ""I can see you, I can shoot you"" the same goes for the other players aswell   
4) Don't go straight for the enemy UNLESS you have several teamates with you. Try your BEST to FLANK the enemy. don't attack them head on. come at them from the sides, above, or even behind them, if one tactic dosen't work... Try something else. the fight is dynamic, just like you!  5) Finally, LEARN the strengths and weaknesses of your weapons, it WILL take time.


P.S. Feel free to add my on steam or PS2 (ingame) the name i listed is my primary although if you want i can tell you the others via PM or steam chat.

P.P.S. I added some tips my teamates and friends gave me. some others on Youtube, like Wrel (Dev) Nico101, Joshino, and others have also said some of these tips. If you want to know more about the game look them up on youtube Especially Wrel, as he's a developer. Nico101 I'd recoment to Older audiences, as there is some ""Humor"" that younger audiences may find offensive or dont understand. (he and his team swear a bit aswell) i do squad ops with them and its mostly moments of WTF?! and general fun. Joshino and Wrel are a great choice to see if you want to Learn more about the game, its mechanics and also for general info/guides for weapons or tactics.

Each faction must capture control points in order to gain control of the planet. There are 6 different soldier classes which allow for large differences in personal gameplay.

Yea, teamwork, leadership and tactics, that's what matters, 
well you will be facing the most equipped warriors and platoons over n over, also you will be swarmed...,
and well the factions and powers are kinda unbalanced and varied on purpose here and there, 
so you will be facing some OP sh1t over n over. A war.
Well yea mostly everything has a downside. Challenge, outsmart, tactics.
One faction population decrease, the faction can be outnumbered. A swarm. Depending on server, can happen often.
Limited numbers, sometimes queues to one world. At least playing underpopulated faction kinda prevents you from queues. Membership has priority.

CPU demanding (average GPU is enough).
Dont expect 120+++ FPS, stable FPS

If you wish for a surface level horde shooter with fun abilities then it will give you that experience in spades, however, it also has the ability to allow you to delve deeper into its systems and lets you customize and maximize your arsenal until you become a walking army.

The story is serviceable in the beginning but in my opinion ages like wine as you progress through the star chart, slowly pulling you into an experience that I have yet to relive in any other Sci-Fi game I've played. While it does go off the rails at times it does so in a way that feels believable and maintains a sense of internal consistency that keeps you informed while still asking questions.

Each frame feels unique even though the devs have released over 50 differing characters, each with a unique kit that (while falling into a manageable amount of categories such as caster vs weapons-platform) still allows players to express their own uniqueness through their selection of frames and weapons. It is rare that any two players' loadouts will be identical to one another.

It is definitely a game I recommend everyone to play at least once and one I definitely recommend to anyone who loves long grinds, deep (though sometimes confusing) mechanical systems, and extreme horde shooters. | Hermoso juego que siempre esta mejorando.

76561198082086866,238960,Path of Exile,0.0,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Free To Play",0,"Path of Exile (POE) não é um MMORPG, como a maioria o classifica. POE é, na verdade, um action-RPG online. Você não tem necessariamente que interagir com outros jogadores se não o quiser, e mesmo que o queira, sua interação é limitada apenas a um chat global e a alguns poucos (5) jogadores que você, por ventura, permita que entrem em sua equipe (party).

Considerado o sucessor verdadeiro do Diablo II pelos mais saudosistas, Path of Exile é um jogo bastante interessante para quem gosta de RPGs hack-and-slash com uma grande gama de possibilidades em suas builds. Com uma árvore de habilidades de mais de 1300 pontos diferentes além de um complexo sistema de crafting, cada personagem torna-se único em seu potencial, apesar de, no momento, não ter tantas possibilidades de customização visual.

Após mais de 4000 horas jogadas, sinto-me confiante que posso dar o verdadeiro valor ao jogo nessa análise sem, no entanto, deixar de considerar seus pontos fracos. Por isso, vamos por partes:

[h1]Conceito e Existência[/h1]
Path of Exile é um jogo que foi desenvolvido desde seu início para dar aos saudosistas jogadores de Diablo II um ar de renovação. Chris Wilson, o líder do projeto, e seus companheiros fundaram uma empresa chamada Grinding Gear Games, a atual responsável pelo gerenciamento do jogo, e decidiram dedicar-se exclusivamente ao desenvolvimento de POE.

Seguindo o modelo original de Diablo II, o Path of Exile tem point-of-view semelhante, embora com gráficos melhores e atualizados para uma nova geração (inclusive, recentemente, recebendo suporte a DirectX 11 e algumas funcionalidades exclusivas deste), além de conter o mesmo 'feeling' de grinding que tanto tornou Diablo II famoso.

[h1]Jogabilidade[/h1]
Com uma árvore de habilidades de mais de 1300 opções, além de 6 raças iniciais, POE tem uma jogabilidade altamente imersível e de grande liberdade aos jogadores. Ao criar um personagem, você tem uma série de quests que devem ser seguidas sob uma história modelo, dividida em dez atos e em duas partes. Ao finalizar a primeira parte da história, você parte para a segunda, com uma dificuldade maior, já que você recebe algumas penalidades.

Terminada a parte da história e com seu personagem por volta do level 60 (level 100 sendo o máximo), você parte então para o conteúdo end-game do jogo, que consiste, na maior parte do tempo, 'rodar' mapas (mais de 100 tipos diferentes) em dificuldades diferentes em busca de mais level e/ou itens raros e ajudar Zana, uma NPC, na guerra do atlas. É aí que o grinding se torna interessante para pessoas que gostam (como eu). Para as que não gostam, você pode simplesmente começar de novo se quiser e tentar novas e divertidas builds.

Para se ter uma ideia dos níveis de grinding do jogo, estima-se que a possibilidade de dropar um dos itens mais raros do jogo (Espelho de Kalandra) seja de uma vez a cada dez anos se você jogar cerca de 4 horas por dia. É bastante, de fato, mas seu alto valor no jogo faz com que todos sonhem com a possibilidade de tornarem-se ricos da noite pro dia.

Os servidores são divididos em ligas. Há a liga permanente softcore e a permanente hardcore. A diferença entre uma e outra consiste no fato de que, se você morrer com seu personagem na liga hardcore, ele será automaticamente transferido para a liga softcore (ao contrário de Diablo, onde você perde o personagem).

Há também as ligas temporárias, normalmente lançadas a cada 2 ou 3 meses. Elas oferecem um ""fresh start"", ou seja, um início fresco para aqueles que não querem se submeter à inflacionada economia das ligas permanentes ou simplesmente desejam tentar se perpetuarem como ricos comerciantes ou crafters de itens nas novas ligas. Note que, ao final de cada liga, seus personagens lá localizados, bem como o baú da sua conta, serão transferidos para as ligas permanentes.

[h1]Gráficos[/h1]
Além do que pode se ver nas próprias imagens, Path of Exile não é um jogo que possa se dizer ser muito voltado ao desenvolvimento de belos gráficos. Os gráficos são sim medianos, mas mantém-se sempre atualizados com o que há de moderno no mundo dos jogos. Há cerca de um ano, como já mencionado, o jogo recebeu suporte a DirectX 11, além de alguns efeitos especiais a mais (como o movimento responsivo de capas e asas de personagens a skills ou até mesmo o vento). Na mesma época o jogo também recebeu portabilidade para o Xbox.

Sua customização visual também não é muito rica (por enquanto), sendo você, na maior parte do tempo, obrigado a ficar preso ao visual de seus itens e de sua raça (não há diferença de sexos, por exemplo - se você escolher raça X onde o personagem é, por padrão, feminino, ele continuará sendo feminino). Toda e qualquer customização visual não padrão, ou seja, que não é próprio do item que você esteja usando, é paga. A única exceção são as recompensas fornecidas no final de cada liga. Apesar disso, no último ano, a GGG tem investido bastante nesse quesito, com uma notável melhora.

O jogo tem atenção exclusiva da Grinding Gear Games, sua empresa gerenciadora. Com um início difícil de 5 funcionários, ela hoje conta com mais de 150 pessoas em dedicação exclusiva, fazendo com que seu suporte seja um dos mais efetivos que eu já tenha visto (enviei cerca de 10 a 15 tickets e a média de tempo para resposta deles foi de 5 minutos - é incrível).

[h1]Comunidade[/h1]
Você pode escolher interagir com a comunidade ou não. Esse é o principal fator que faz com que Path of Exile não seja, per-se, um MMORPG, onde, por definição, você é obrigado a interagir com um universo de jogadores. No geral, a comunidade de Path of Exile é bastante amigável e disposta a ajudar, mas, como em todo jogo, há bastantes trolls e, principalmente, scammers.

O [i]scam[/i] é legalizado no jogo desde que não seja através de transações da vida real (ou RMT - do inglês, [i]real money trading[/i]). De acordo com o próprio Chris Wilson, a empresa tenta não realizar nenhum tipo de regulação do mercado dentro do jogo, logo cabe a cada jogador tomar conta de seus itens e analisar seu devido valor antes de se desfazer dele para outro jogador. Ainda segundo ele, no jogo, [i]'knowledge is power, and power is everything'[/i] (conhecimento é poder, e poder é tudo).

No começo, não foram poucas as vezes que fui enganado por jogadores mais experientes, comprando a preço de banana mercadorias que poderiam valer bem mais caso eu soubesse seu devido valor, por isso recomendo cautela a jogadores novatos.

[h1]Pay-to-win?[/h1]
[b]Não.[/b] Não há sequer um fator que possa ser considerado pay-to-win em todo o jogo. Tudo que é adquirido por dinheiro real é por mero conceito de embelezamento e/ou [i]status quo[/i]. O único fator que possa ser considerado pay-to-win para alguns jogadores (eu não considero, no entanto) é o fato de que, ao criar uma nova conta, você recebe gratuitamente 3 abas no baú e para adquirir mais abas você deve dispor de dinheiro real.

No entanto, é bem comum o conceito de [i]mules[/i] no jogo, onde você cria vários personagens (você pode criar mais de 20 ao todo) para guardar itens dentro de seus inventários, o que não faz com que seja um fator limitante aos jogadores que não desejam pagar por conteúdo dentro do jogo.

[h1]Conclusão[/h1]
Path of Exile é uma obra-prima dos action-RPGs onlines. Sem dúvida o melhor do gênero, com a melhor companhia de jogos existente da atualidade em sua direção, mas eu, obviamente, sou suspeito a falar, já que ""desperdicei"" (e com orgulho) mais de 3000 horas da minha vida no jogo. Se você gosta de jogos com bastante [i]grinding[/i] e com uma grande gama de possibilidades de ações, sugiro que teste Path of Exile.

[h1]Nota: 9.5/10[/h1]
Pontos positivos:
[+] Grinding complexo
[+] Grande gama de possibilidades
[+] Árvore de habilidades com mais de 1300 opções
[+] Ligas que oferecem um começo igual a todos

Pontos negativos:
[-] Baixa gama de customização visual (mas que tem melhorado no último ano) | Yoa so nach knapp 4k std. Spielzeit kann ich wohl mal ein Review verfassen :P.

F2P oder P2W ? => Es ist wirklich F2P, man kann alle Charaktäre Fähigkeiten etc verwenden und ausspielen, es gibt kein EXP Boost oder ähnliches.

Wie finanziert sich die Firma hinter dem Spiel ? => MTX ähnlich wie in Dota gibt es Armor, Waffen und Fähigkeits ""Skins"" welche das Spiel selber aber nicht beeinflussen. 

Also muss man kein Geld ausgeben ? 
=> Jaein xD, wenn man sehr viel spielt und einem das Spiel nun wirklich gefällt sollte man seinen Stash(Truhe) erweitern, hier nimmt man dann mal 20€ in die Hand (wenn dir dieses Spiel keine 20€ wert ist dann lass es halt ^^), für dieses Spiel allerdings noch zu wenig bei dem was es dir bietet. 
Ich persönlich spiel das Spiel seit der closed Beta(2013) und habe zu jedem kostenlosen DLC ( ein DLC bietet ca so viel Umfang wie Diablo III insgesamt, es gibt bereits 5 DLC´s) der Firma GrindingGearGames etwas Geld zukommen lassen und hab mir davon Stash Erweiterungen und Skins gekauft.

Ist es Einsteiger freundlich ? 
=> Auch hier ein Jaein, wer bereits viele Action RPG`s gezockt hat wird etwas schneller ins Spiel finden, wer keine Erfahrungen hat wird es sehr schwer haben aber gut Ding will Weile haben :P.
Also einfach Google nutzen und man wird schnell merken das die PoE Community ins gesamt nett und freundlich ist und es gibt ne menge Anfänger guides von größeren Streamern. Hier und da sollte man also bei Twitch.tv sich Builds in Action ansehen oder im Forum einen Build heraussuchen ;).
Und lasst euch nicht vom Skill Baum abschrecken, man wird diesen lieben wenn man das Spiel mehr und mehr versteht, genau dieser bietet einen unglaubliche Freiheiten seinen Charakter einzigartig zu machen und evtl. einen wirklich guten Build zu erstellen.

Ist es auf deutsch spielbar ?
=> JA!!!!, es ist nun möglich es auf DEUTSCH zu stellen !!!!! ;-)  

Diablo III oder POE ?
=> Ich spiele beides, aber PoE bietet sag ich mal 10x so viel und ist F2P , auch grafisch mag ich PoE mehr da es düsterer, brutaler und gnadenloser ist.

Gibt es einen Harcore Modus ?
=> Ja, der gestorbene Charakter landet in Sofcore. Anders als in Diablo III gibt es keine passive Fähigkeit die dich retten kann.

Ist die Story gut erzählt ?
=>Nein, keine tollen Videos und auch kaum Vertonung, der Fokus lag wie es richtig ist, auf dem Gameplay, aber mitlerweile wird mehr und mehr vertont und nachgebessert.

Gibt es ein Late-Game ?
=> Ja und zwar ein absolut geaniales Late-Game !, mit lvl 60 ist man ca. fertig mit der Story welche man 3mal durchpielt (Normal,Cruel,Merciless), nach einiger Erfahrung geht das ziemlich schnell. Im Late-Game läuft man Maps welche durch Portale geöffnet werden und zufällig generiert werden, der Name der Map gibt einem Info darüber wie das Layout ca aussehen wird und welcher Boss auf einem wartet, auch hier die PoE wiki nutzen oder Ytube Videos schauen wie der Boss Fight ablaufen wird.

Gibt es einen Trade Markt wo Spieler untereinander handeln ?
=> JA, es gibt kein Gold oder ähnliches, im Spiel findet man Orbs welche zu Iteam craften genutzt werden können oder auch als Währung, dabei sind diese aufgrund ihrer verschiedenen Seltenheit unterschiedlich viel Wert, am Ende ist es ehher ein tausch System, ich gebe dir ``x`` von und du gibst mir deine Armor.
 
Am Ende kann ich nur sagen das es sich hier um ein Spiel handelt, für welches man viel Zeit haben sollte, der Anfang wird sehr schwer sein da es sehr viele Meschaniken gibt, wenn du also ein Spiel suchst an dem du dich messen kannst und dich frei entwickeln kannst bist du bei PoE genau richtig.

Hier noch ein paar links zu Seiten dich euch sicher weiter helfen werden ;)

www.twitch.tv <--- hier einfach mal Builds live in Action anschauen und evtl Leute im Chat um Hilfe bitten, wie gesagt ist der große Teil der Community sehr nett, liegt vermutlich daran das es nicht competitive ist ^^.

MfG Schlomo und viel Spaß beim spielen !!!! | La verdad es que era bastante reticente a probar este juego. En primer lugar, no me gustan los ""free2play"". Suelen acabar en ""pay 2 win"", comunidades tóxicas, DLCs sospechosamente obligatorios, y una calidad general bastante baja. Además, tengo todos los Diablo comprados, desde el I al III con todas sus expansiones. Teniendo el original, ¿para que jugar a un clon? 

Pues Path of Exile me ha sorprendido. 

En primer lugar, en la tienda del juego sólo venden objetos cosméticos, espacio de almacenamiento, y packs de soporte. Nada que afecte al desarrollo del personaje o al poder de los objetos.

En cuanto al desarrollo del personaje, el juego tiene 19 clases de partida. Pero no son clases cerradas, sino más bien ""zonas de inicio"" que puedes desarrollar a través de un árbol con cientos (literalmente) de skills pasivos. 

Tiene mucho contenido, diez actos. Muchas misiones secundarias, aleatorias, y tramas paralelas (maestros, refugio, etc...). Cada cierto tiempo abren una liga, en la que todos los jugadores empiezan de cero y hay algún evento específico.

La ambientación del mundo es muy siniestra, a ratos realmente gore. Me gusta la historia. Gráficamente no están mal, aunque no está a la altura de Diablo. 

El sistema de juego está lleno de buenas ideas. Por ejemplo, no hay habilidades activas, se consiguen a través de gemas que se engarzan en el equipo. Las gemas pueden subirse de nivel, y hasta hay gemas de soporte que potencian el efecto de otras gemas. 

Hay pociones, como en Diablo 2, pero se rellenan solas cuando matas enemigos, no tienes que llevar 500 pociones en el inventario.

Sistema de crafting básico y avanzado. Se pueden mejorar y alterar los objetos, reforjar estadísticas, etc...

En resumen, un ARPG hardcore, con una curva de aprendizaje un poco bestia al principio, pero con muchísimas posibilidades. Encima gratis y sin pay2win. No sé que más se puede pedir. |

Path of Exile é um RPG de ação 3D publicado pela Grinding Gear Games. Semelhante a jogos como Diablo e Torchlight, Path of Exile permite aos jogadores explorar vários calabouços (dungeons) nas formas de história ""Atos"". Os jogadores têm uma grande variedade de classes iniciais para escolher, mas cada classe serve apenas como o ponto de partida inicial para a progressão do personagem de um jogador.

Os jogadores têm a sua disponibilidade uma enorme quantidade de gemas (skill gems) e opções passivas da skill tree. As gemas podem ser encaixadas no equipamento do personagem e concedem uma escala larga das habilidades, que dependem do tipo e da cor da gema. As gemas podem até subir de nível para fornecer uma versão mais forte da skill. A árvore de habilidades é um conjunto vasto e complexo de combinações de skills passivas. Cada jogador pode escolher entre uma enorme variedade de alocações pontuais para realmente personalizar a sua classe de personagens.

Path of Exile apresenta tanto PvE e PvP com eventos como corridas de nivelamento que ocorrem em servidores dedicados. Outras variações incluem um modo Cut-Throat, onde os jogadores podem invadir instâncias de outros jogadores e matá-los para levar seus itens. Cada evento pode durar de apenas uma hora a vários meses e premiar valiosos prêmios para os vencedores. Os fãs da mecânica de rastreamento de dungeons (*dungeon crawling) mais tradicionais encontrados no Diablo 2 devem definitivamente dar uma chance ao Path of Exile.

*Sistema [b]dungeon crawling[/b]:

O sistema de [b]dungeon crawling[/b] é um tipo de cenário em jogos de role-playing de fantasia em que os heróis navegam em um ambiente labiríntico, lutando contra vários monstros e saqueando qualquer tesouro que possam encontrar. Devido à sua simplicidade, o dungeon crawling pode ser mais fácil para um *gamemaster executar do que aventuras mais complexas, e o estilo de ""hack and slash"" é apreciado por jogadores que se concentram em ação e combate.

*Um [b]gamemaster[/b] ( GM , também conhecido como mestre de jogo , gerente de jogo , moderador de jogo ou árbitro ) é uma pessoa que atua como um organizador, oficiante para perguntas sobre regras, arbitragem para um jogo de RPG multiplayer .Eles são mais comuns em jogos cooperativos em que os jogadores trabalham juntos do que em jogos competitivos em que os jogadores se opõem uns aos outros. O ato realizado por um gamemaster é às vezes referido como ""Gamemastering"" ou simplesmente ""GM-ing"".
O papel básico do gamemaster é o mesmo em quase todos os jogos tradicionais de role-playing, embora diferentes conjuntos de regras tornam os deveres específicos do gamemaster exclusivo para esse sistema.

-Se você decidir investir dinheiro, todos os preços estão bem equilibrados.
-Muitos itens
-Cópia fiel ao Diablo 2
-Skill tree avançada 

[b]Contras:[/b]

-Alguns problemas de atraso e desconexões aleatórias, Não posso dizer que é perfeito, mas eu jogo tranquilamente com ping bem baixo. Porém, vejo algumas pessoas com problemas de vez em quando.
-Pontos de controle são muito distantes, por esse motivo o jogador tem que correr para o objetivo com a necessidade de perder alguns minutos em vez de usar o teleporte para checkpoints, que são muito longes do objetivo da missão.
- Customizaçao de personagens.


Lendo o site ficou claro que foi produzido de fã para fãs, devido a frases como:

[i] - ""Totalmente gratuito e nunca será pay to win""
- ""Estamos cansados da moda de fadas e luzes, Path Of Exile é realístico e escuro""[/i] 
E muitas outras...

Path Of Exile está de parabéns e merece respeito já por isto, recomendo para jogadores assíduos e que veneram o estilo Old School.


[b]Nota final 8/10.[/b]

 | Первый обзор, постараюсь кратко и со смыслом.

Отличный аналог Диабло, не могу сказать что он лучше или хуже, но для проекта, который создавался на минимум бюджета, оооочень недурственно. 
  Из плюсов: 
- Очень улыбнула графика. Она выдержана в своем стиле, сразу переносишься во времена Diablo2, когда было все ради фана и атмосферы.
- Для небольшого количества героев, просто огромный выбор классов. Благодаря системе развития пассивных навыков, это просто надо увидеть и попробовать, лично я остался под огромным впечатлением. Можно конечно канониченых магов, лучников и варов делать, но так же невесело. +)
- Понравился сюжетный режим. Несомненный плюс в прохождении с друзьями, опять таки за счет того, что билды героев нестандартны и очень вариотивны. Можно творить все, что вздумается, а это большая редкость для РПГ.
- Система активных скилов и крафта выполнена на высоте. Аналогов я просто не встречал, просто один раз попробовать и самому увидеть лучше, чем сто раз прочитать любой из обзоров.
  Из минусов:
- Лично для меня из минусов стала мини карта и ее большой брат, очень тускло, постоянно режет глаза. Но на это можно забить большой болт. Лично мое мнение.
- Есть еще один момент, касаемо новичков. Придется много читать статей и гайдов по героям, ибо настает момент, когда Вы попросту можете дальше не пройти из-за своего билда, нестандартаня раскачка весло, но может стать занозой в ягодной части при прохождении в соло. Опять таки может это у меня руки кривые, а у Вас все получится. +)

По итогу. В PoE обязательно стоит попробовать полиграть всем ценителям РПГ жанра, я уверяю тебя уважаемый читатель, равнодушным проект не оставит, хоть сначала может показаться странным и тяжеловатым. Но. Оно того определенно стоит. Ни разу не пожалел проведенного времени, жаль мало набегал, ибо все время свободное отнимает КС.
10 из 10 тысяч вариантов пасивок!!! Одобренно!!! +)"

I really like this game because of all of it's action and stratagy that 
you have to involve in it and im not saying it's perfect. In act 1 you 
can get a free dragon after beating and theres up to act 3 right now 
and it involves a really cool story line sounds cool right, guess again. 

you have to pay for the other act's and a lot of the things you can buy 
with real money and or game money is kind of overpriced in my opinion 
because you only get 100 money per victory and it cost's 5000 for three 
random dragon eggs and 2500 for a new weapon, there is interesting runes
too and you can upgrade your weapens at the forge with stuff you find in
battle or pay for wich is the only cheap thing in my opinion. 

Other than that this game is amazing you really have to work with your team 
in battle to cover everything and it's still preatty difficult ven if you
have 5 ppeople in skype. you also get this portrait of a dragon and when
you level up it fills up by that much more with i like to level up in for
that reason. So in conclusion i think it's an awesome game and can't wait
for future updates. | eu estou dando opiniao positiva porque me enganei e peso  desculpas para os criadores , por postar uma opiniao negativa sem nessesidade, jogo bom viciante graficos boms cenarios boms , muito dragao armas, o melhor de tudo nesse jogo e que voce pode fazer missao single ou mltiplayer ou coop , compra armas , dragoes , dar level up neles, comprar runa e mais de 100 missao em solo. o que faltou nesse jogo foi divulgamento players, colocar dinovo o titan pass para que novos players possao compra colocar dinovo o sistema de compra, mais mapas e atualizasao e  ser mais justo com quem nao tem titan pass, porque e dificil comseguir as coisas para quem nao tem ganha x4 menos do que quem tem. lembrese de fazer o tutorial e uma missao para desbloquear as runas atributos valiosos que te ajudan na batalha nao cometan o erro de achar que as runas so vem despois de determinado rnak ou que tem um  jeito de ganhar runas sem fazer o tutorial ou missao nao cometan o mesmo erro que cometi achei que so desbloqueava runa em rank alto e acabei negativando o jogo so presisa melhorar um pouco no sistema multiplayer por causa do desbalanceamento de level . situasao atual do jogo poucos players, sem atualizao sem mapas novos sem novidade , sem divulgamento sem sistema de compras, e ainda injusto com players que nao tem titan pass, outra coisa que faltou e, e a situasao atual do jogo e que quando voce paga o titan pass nao tem todas as skims de dragao e outro detalhe importante voce perde suas skim de dragao lord se voce for um player normal como lobo , mago, elemental de fogo, elemental de agua, se comprar o titan pass algumas skims citadas vao sumir e nao vao aparecer isso tanbem e uma situasao atual do jogo porem ainda tem muitas skims bonita nos dois lados tanto no player normal quanto no titan pass so lembrando player normal nao tem skim de dragao nao bonus nada. apesar disso tudo o jogo e divertido atrativo e chamativo atraente e viciante qualidades em um jogo que nao pode faltar fora que e bem feito e belos acabamentos opiniao final: exelente nota 10,0. | Es ist ein bissi schwer aber macht dennoch viel Spass.Es hat super Tuts in denen man mit allem vertraut gemacht wird was man später bei allen Spielmodi braucht.Man steuert einen Drachen durch verschiedene Level und muss gegen Gegner kämpfen.

The mechanics and cards make this game a blast to play.  But mistakes were made and the game mostly died.  The thing that made me quit was when everything was converted into costing gold.  I used to use silver to buy event tickets and sometimes splurge on a legendary chest when I was feeling impulsive.  Then the cost of boosters went from 5000 silver per pack to 7500 and everything else had to use gold(which can only be acquired by paying money for it).  That pretty much did it for me.  The greed was real.  I paid $20 for this game while it was still an early release game.  The only uses that silver has now is buying the solforge booster pack, buying deckslots, and forging cards.  I really like this game but can't recommend it.  It still has the issues of a few people paying to be at the top while the grinders are left losing early and often to these superior bought decks.  I guess that I'm in the middle of the road.  It is a good game but has many flaws. | SolForge is an interesting take on the digital card genre. It's a fairly simplistic card game, but with a suprising amount of depth / theorycrafting to your decks once you've unlocked some cards. It has the unique aspect of your cards levelling up as you play them; adding a depth of strategy that other card games haven't really explored. Not only do you have to think about what card to play right now, in order to damage your opponent, or save yourself from damage, but you also have to think about the future - and which cards you'll want then and how your deck will evolve compared to their deck.

The starter decks are playable, but I would strongly advise you to buy some packs (you can use silver which you can get from logging on daily and from winning matches) and get a custom deck going. You will get your ass kicked taking your cheap/free decks into PvP, but you can win your silver rewards playing against the AI - which is beatable on all difficulties with the starter decks, although the higher difficulties will be a challenge. If you do use real money to purchase packs, you will have a higher chance of getting the best cards, ultimately people should remember that card games are about spending money and RNG, but overall this is very playable as a free player too.

One of the big advantages of this game right now to me is that the Ipad app is extremely fluid and responsive. You can play untimed games with friends and the push notifications are accurate - meaning if you have a lazy day with 5 minutes to spare here and there, you can have a good duel with your friend from anywhere. (Untimed) games save despite the application being shut down; and you can start a game on the ipad and continue it on the PC, or have the game running in two locations at once if you so desire. A lot of digital card games right now have promised this sort of cross platform interactivity, but few have competently provided it yet. The android app is sadly not out yet so I can't comment on that - but they have said there'll be one in the future.

I'm pretty happy with it overall and would recommend. | I've played this game lots and lots. Put some money it is. Very worthwhile all that time.

Well, until the update / overhaul happened.

I played the PC version and iOS version.
And both are so down graded visually, but also the UI.
There are a few improvements that are good (timer etc). 
But overall, they just killed the game for me. | It's a good concept and would be a lot of fun, but it's pay to win. The heroic and legendary cards completely overwelm the other cards by a drastic amount. Even after months of rewards you won't be able to compete with someone who paid. In ranked play decks may be filled with over half of these types of cards. If you have a decent amount of money to throw at it then get it, but if you're just a casual gamer then it will cause you a great amount of anti-fun. | First of all, I should say I really like the way this game plays. The rules and cards are interesting and unique. 

However, I would not recommend it for most. The only players left are running around with the same 3 netdecks. Without a huge amount of money or time, you have no chance. With a huge amount of money or time, you're stuck using one of those 3 netdecks to compete. 

There is a ranking system, however the player base is so small that it doesn't really seem to find matches based on anything.

I really enjoyed this game when it first came out, but then I couldn't keep up and got tired of getting stomped by the same decks with 70% legendary cards.

Bottom Line: This game isn't friendly to new players, and is slowly losing old players. It's a shame."

По сути говоря, это файтинг, но файтинг весьма своеобразный, можно даже сказать, исключительный. В качестве героев выступают собранные из шариков и кубиков куклы, поначалу находящиеся в статичном режиме. Целью игры является нанесение как можно большего урона противнику посредством выбора удачной комбинации движений. Игроки самостоятельно решают, как именно они будут действовать в отдельно взятом раунде. Куклы могут драться руками, ногами и головой, совершать прыжки и уклонения – все зависит от манеры поведения самих геймеров. Кажется, что все весьма просто, но это не так. Чтобы исполнить мало-мальски удобоваримое комбо, нужно учесть множество факторов (Toribash базируется на чистой физике), а на выполнение красивой и продуманной атаки и вовсе придется затратить уйму времени и сил. Почему? Все дело в этих самых шариках и кубиках, из которых состоят куклы. Если просто-напросто ткнуть на активные точки-фигуры, не проведя никаких вычислений, то кукла, скорее всего, грохнется на пол, ни капельки не повредив оппоненту. 

Залог победы в Toribash – тщательный и скрупулезный анализ своих действий. Нужно учитывать, в какой позе находится боец, какое у него состояние: напряженное или расслабленное, куда он отклоняется в процессе битвы и так далее. Да, все это достаточно сложно, но куда труднее было бы, если поединки в Toribash проходили в режиме реального времени. Но в Toribash реализован пошаговый режим, благодаря которому игроки могут более-менее адекватно контролировать своих подопечных, хотя и это не является панацеей. Конечно, особенно сильно страдают новички, столкнувшиеся с Toribash впервые, но даже они, при должной доле усидчивости, могут поднатореть в драках за пару-тройку деньков, а за неделю – достичь по-настоящему серьезных успехов. Но стать мастеровитым “сенсеем” все равно не выйдет ни за две недели, ни за три – тут уже потребуется месяц серьезнейших тренировок. | wish it had a single player mode to earn those damned creds for unlocks but then again i would like to be able to make a full move set as a combat style | .Try to use tatics

So if you want a game for clever people, where you win with thinking, not skill or luck here you go :-) peace guys

-36 | I've played this game quite a lot in the past before it was released to Steam. By no means was I good, especially since the game has a rather large learning curve. This learning curve comes from the fact that various joints must be manipulated to get results, but casual players (especially friends) will often find hilarity due to the manipulation of their characters sometimes in rather awkward positions. Multiplayer games are rather fast-paced compared to singleplayer sessions due to the timer which limits the time players can think before it runs out. Otherwise, various mods come with the game which adds plenty of PvP options (arena type, weapons, body sensitivity, etc.), or solo challenges (parkour, skateboarding, sports, etc.).

In terms of play by more seasoned/veteran players (not including myself), other players can find interest in the rather complicated techniques used to simulate real fights or complete parkour maps.

Overall, this game takes a long time to fully understand since the tutorial does not completely cover everything, but once players get past this, they'll find many challenges to overcome."

1、共同回合的机制。对战双方同时执行自己的回合，然后统一结算。富有战略性，能体验运筹帷幄的快乐。
2、对战区域的划分。包括进攻区域、防守区域、支援区域、指挥官区域，以及由它们组成的概念：被部署区域、战场。区域的划分和不同区域特定的功能大大扩展了对战策略的可能性。
3、卡组机制。组成套牌前对势力的选择决定了你整个套牌的风格和可利用的资源，要求玩家不断取舍，最终完成自己喜欢的战术。
4、比较轻松的游戏体验。不需要大量的时间、精力和金钱投入。
当你在了解了整个游戏从确立思路、组建套牌到最终随机应变取得胜利之后，游戏的体验会相当不错。然而这款游戏的诸多缺点也就来源于玩家这个熟悉过程之前。
1、中文翻译不完整，概念解释缺失。游戏初期有诸多不加解释的概念，严重影响玩家融入游戏。包括组建套牌时的规则不明确，会让新手玩家摸不着头脑。
2、糟糕的网络连接。较差的网络环境甚至不能让你完整体验一场游戏。
3、UI（交互界面元素）设计不合理，拥有较多生物时会拥挤，难以精确操作。画面特效单一。
当玩家熟悉了这些之后，我仍然认为这款游戏值得喜爱卡牌游戏的玩家尝试一下。同时也希望官方能加紧改正上述缺点（如果可能的话）
希望我的体验能帮到大家，祝大家游戏愉快。
 | É um jogo de cartas animado em que você coloca diversas criaturas para duelar em seu nome. São vários adversários em uma campanha longa, que passa por diversos lugares e enfrenta desafiantes poderosos e repletos de recursos para frear a sua jornada.
Jogo bom, porém algumas funções meia confusas. | 粗略玩了一下.简单地来说一说自己的观点.
优点:
1.相较于其他卡牌游戏,双方同时执行回合的玩法增加了游戏的战略性
2.每个种族的特性较为鲜明
3.场地被划分为3块(支援区,进攻区,防守区)的玩法也增加了游戏的战略性

缺点:
1.每个玩家虽然拥有两种血量,但其实第二种血量(士气)基本只是为了龙族之裔的削士气战术单独服务.95%的时候士气都是多余的.作为游戏中的重要参数之一,略显累赘
2.卡牌技能介绍做地非常差,是我玩过的所有卡牌游戏中最差的一款,这足以成为让新人弃坑的原因.举例:人族某卡被部属在进攻区域后会拥有坚不可摧特性,至于坚不可摧是什么,我翻遍了游戏都没找到解释.也许是不受战斗伤害,也许是不会受到伤害,也许就是无敌.同上还有超载X,激怒X,虚弱X,生命X等
3.游戏的卡包过多,而且无法得知卡包内所包含的所有卡.只能通过牌组中浏览所有卡来逆向搜索自己想要的卡所在的卡包.
4.卡片虽然可以交易,但是与此同时也少了拆分合成功能.低稀有度卡极易数量溢出.且对于独狼玩家来说伤害巨大.
5.牌组组合界面操作相当难受,你能同时浏览到的牌只有一行约10张.而滚动牌堆时的操作惯性相当违和,稍微滚动一点只能翻过几张,而再稍微多滚动一点则是会一口气翻过去很多张.与此同时,当你想把牌加入指挥官位置时,如果放置位置不当,就会把所有同名卡全部移除牌组,然后你又不得不自己一张一张加回来.
6.游戏技巧需要玩家自己挖掘,战斗前的读取界面没有实用的小提示.举例:一般卡片的牌组数量限制为3,被加入到指挥官位置的卡不会被算入卡组数量限制.即,一张数量限制为3的卡最多可以在牌组中添加6张(指挥官位置X3+牌组X3).
7.游戏系统极其难受,当你在场上拥有大量单位以后,他们将在区域里挤成一团.而如果你想拉动他们到其他区域,你需要极其小心且不得不一张一张地拉动它们,假如你还想将他们的位置顺序交换,你还得再小心翼翼地拉动它们.整个过程对操作的精度要求比较高,至少不像是从手牌拍怪那样按住鼠标往上甩就好了.

虽然我列举的缺点比优点多很多,而且也不推荐这款游戏.但是我还是比较喜欢这款游戏的.优点虽然少,但是核心玩法还是可圈可点的.而且缺点大部分也不会经常经历.

至于不推荐的理由:
1.这款游戏不适合入门级卡牌游戏玩家以及欠缺耐心和金钱的玩家.游戏已经开服很久了,对于现在入坑的玩家来说,要补的卡包数量相当可观.而且由于没有卡片拆分合成系统.要不氪金完全组出自己的牌组需要以月为单位来积累.当然你能找到大佬免费送你卡当我没说.
2.2014年9月5日发行的游戏,我今天2017年2月12日刚玩了8.1个小时(通完剧情,教程,挑战,打了盘竞技场,开玩送的卡包,又自己买了一包开,自己组了一套牌组)就能发现游戏还有那么多不方便的地方,其中几个地方还令人发指(战斗时卡片聚堆)这让我对游戏开发商的态度以及能力表示怀疑. | wonderful game, can't understand all the hate is receiving. It's fun and entertaining, a perfect way to spend an hour or two in front of the pc. 

To the devs: please fix the japanese faction (you know, the green one based on morale ) because they're absolute trash right now, lol. | I have not played the remake of this game recently, but one big reason, and I hope the creators stop going down this path:

They've split their already small cult following into 3 by publishing 3 similar games with the same IP and similar gameplay. Not sure what the goal of that was, when their player base is already fairly small, because it's going to make me and others reluctant to invest in Infinity Wars Classic if it's going to be replaced by Infinity Wars 2 in the future. They really need to combine the games back into one, focus on it, and make it hit critical mass so that players can actually start recommending it to their friends.

EDIT: Thanks for the explanation! This makes more sense than what I had originally understood, so I've updated the review accordingly.

I will say that while I still have some doubts, the game design of Infinity Wars is honestly a masterpiece, it solves all the problems I've had with other online card games (like Hearthstone/MTGO) in the past. I'll highlight the two biggest points which I think other online card games got wrong.

Firstly, there's actual trading, and it doesn't feel like MTGO where it feels like you're trading with a stock market because there's thousands of copies of each card. It feels much more like going to a card game store and trading with friends, because there's multiple different rarities which make the more rare card+rarity combinations rare enough that they feel unique. This means that people will haggle, or look around to find someone who has that one card they've been looking for. Feels very much like trading in-person.

Secondly, it removes the RNG aspect of mana-based card games in the early game. Games with lands like MTG and Eternal suffer from mana flood/drought, which adds an unnecessary and un-fun element of RNG to the game. However, even Hearthstone which does not have lands, suffers from early game RNG because drawing cards on curve is extremely important to surviving/winning the early game, and makes early game much more RNG dependent than lategame. This game fixes both problems by having automatic mana increases like Hearthstone, but also giving you a choice of 3 Commanders which you can choose during deck-building to start every game with. This lets you pick defensive early game, and scaling options as a control deck, so you don't end up skipping your first 4 turns like other card games, and high tempo high power cards for aggro decks, so you don't feel like you just fall behind early game and have no hope because of a bad draw.

This review may have become very long, but it's because I honestly believe Infinity Wars is the best designed card game out there, and as long as they can get the UI/marketing done right, it will be a huge hit in my opinion."

Brutal Legend é uma baita homenagem ao rock n' roll em geral, incorporando todo o apelo dos seus diferentes subgêneros num cenário totalmente literal. No controle de Eddy, interpretado por nosso querido Jack Black, exploramos um mundo aberto em plena Era do Metal, um futuro apocalíptico onde a música e a magia são basicamente a mesma coisa. Os humanos, divididos e hostilizados, são ainda escravizados por hordas de demônios, em meio de biomas diferentes e de paisagens impressionantes. A muralha dos amplificadores, a floresta da cerveja e as minas do gelo seco são apenas um gostinho do que há no cenário, onde muitos dos seus NPCs são baseados em ícones reais, como Ozzy Osbourne (Black Sabbath) e Lemmy (Motorhead). 

Com um gameplay fraco e bastante repetitivo, o fantástico mundo aberto é preenchido por atividades repetidas que podem ser encontradas a cada novo bioma explorado. Elas se consistem em saltos com o nosso carro customizável, o ""Diabo Flamejante"", várias corridas, além de coletáveis como solos de guitarra e estátuas de dragão. A missão principal oferece menos enrolação, onde levamos a luta através da nossa ""turnê"" diretamente aos caricatos vilões. Há também um sistema de batalhas de palco contra palco, onde controlamos tropas num estilo de jogo de estratégia em tempo real. Esses momentos são específicos de trechos da campanha, apesar de representarem 100% do seu multiplayer, onde jogadores podem batalhar entre si (Sim, o online ainda funciona!!).

Obviamente, a trilha sonora de Brutal Legend é o seu maior destaque, contendo músicas licenciadas de tudo que é tipo, que variam entre heavy rock/metal, power metal, thrash, death e power metal. A experiência, autêntica e cômica, me atraía sempre que me dava vontade de ouvir uma música boa, ao invés de simples vontade de jogar um jogo. Recomendo para qualquer um que já saiu num calor de 40 graus usando só preto. | What a great unique game. I am so surprised that there isin't a sequel.

This is absolutely beautiful.
And I just have to mention the music of Ben Babbitt separately - together with the story, it did so much to me. | Kentucky Route Zero is a ""capital A"" arthouse game, which makes it a tough sell as a commercial product. I liked its themes of displacement, and the game is at its best when it is moving quickly between stunningly framed tableaux and evocative character vignettes. However, the majority of the experience is brutally slow, and I lost patience well before Kentucky Route Zero was finished introducing its large cast of characters, which muted the overall impact of the story.

I respect what Kentucky Route Zero is trying to do, but ultimately I can't think of anyone that I personally know to whom I could recommend this game. | This game might be the most important piece of interactive media since the dawn of computer technology, and its influence will be felt far into the future. It is not a game in the traditional sense but rather a meticulously crafted virtual experience that has defined its own grammar, established a new identity, and attracted a unique type of player. It is a game for musicians, cinema enthusiasts, readers, artists, and even for those who have never played video games before or felt unsure about how to engage with them. It is also for individuals contemplating the artistry of video games or, more profoundly, the idea of games as a form of art.

The game raises profound questions about the impact of interactive media and how it can influence us. It does so in a straightforward manner while delivering a powerful aesthetic and emotional experience.

At times, it may feel slow or uneventful, but it is also frequently beautiful, atmospheric, and impactful. Spending time in the world of Kentucky Route Zero and engaging with its characters can be an immensely rewarding experience that stays with you for years to come. | What I liked: attractive, spare animation; smart writing about big topics (class, wage slavery, environment); outstanding music. What I didn't like: it felt like my choices had no effect on the story, and I didn't feel connected with the characters. Perhaps rolling out the phases of the game over many years meant that the designers changed their mind over time about some things, but yeah, there were some choices that didn't make sense to me (like Conway's arc). I didn't finish Act V because I lost interest. | I love this game. Surreal, funny, and emotionally resonant. If you like David Lynch, play this game."

The %of hitting and missing is way off.  It's incredibly common to miss with a 99% change to hit.  One battle I missed 3x in a row.  Anything below 70% is almost a guaranteed miss.  The fact the the hired runners have no armor is absurd.  They are almost useless in a fight.  The game is unbalanced at best. | Игра проходняк, полной стоимости не стоит, проходится часов за 15.

It is turn based and linear; you go out on missions, then return to your home to level up, re-supply, pick up side missions, and progress the story.

At first I was disappointed, but the story and atmosphere sucked me in.

Their are 5 races (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Orc, and Troll) and 6 classes (Samurai, Mage, Decker, Rigger, Shaman, Physical Adept) but racial limits on attributes and skills are disappointingly limited. There's no point in making a troll as anything other than a Samurai or Physical Adept, for example, as their racial limits would prevent any other class' skills rising above 6 points (out of 15)

The games also have fan-made campaigns available in the Steam community

76561198082086866,65930,The Bureau: XCOM Declassified,0.0,Action,0,"[h1] BETRAYAL! - Wait no. This isn't that bad [/h1]

This game was never going to be a runaway success, It’s design as a tactical action shooter left it firmly in the shadow of the unreleased X-com: Alliance. An FPS Squad shooter slated for 2001. But releasing this near simultaneously with Enemy Unknown was a detrimental mistake that buried this game.
Which is a shame, because its not bad- despite a few questionable design choices.

[h2] This doesn't make the best first impression [/h2]

Ahem. If you check out the steam discussions many will complain the AI is underwhelming, which it half-true. The companions are lobotomised, until you get them to level 5. Then they become responsive and more importantly have enough health to not immediately keel over & die to every encounter.
Any orders you direct to your squad are immediately carried out, they even change texture to illustrate they’re following your commands. Their actions are queued and each class has their own set of unique abilities all designed to synergise.
Support casts Disrupt, you use the ability levitate, then Recon uses Critical strike. 
Congrats!
You just killed everything except for a Muton or Sectopod. If you time it right.

Commands are done through a proto Fallout 4 VATS system where time slows down, and there is even a mass effect dialogue wheel for interacting with characters. It’s neat. 

The squad is limited just to three which sucks since the player counts as a unit.
Mind control is a late game action which really adds tactical variety. Deployable drones, Turrets and Silacoid’s all work surprisingly well.
The combat is satisfying once you level up your roster of companions. Don’t worry about the permadeath, you can simultaneously send new recruits off to do automated missions as you play which levels them up.
A Total party kill is easily replaceable with no disadvantage, just customise the new squad to look like the old.
By the mid game I didn’t need to micromanage my companions anymore, they could tank most things, the AI automatically avoids grenades to the point they’ll never be hit. It’s nice… You just have to get them to level 5 because the starting health pool and their lack of abilities really screws with the AI’s capability to dynamically react.
These soldiers were lobotomised in the early game, they do get better.

[h2] The difficulty is meaningless [/h2]

You will never fight more than two mutons until the final level, you will only encounter a maximum of two Sectopod’s, only a handful of optional side missions have Sectoid’s swam you on mass and the Outsiders and all their variants can be managed systematically. Difficulty has no bearing on the mechanics.
It just nerfs your abilities and turns everything into a bullet sponge if you raise it.
Whilst I completed it on Commander difficulty, I did replay a little bit on novice and the early game was more enjoyable. The spawns didn’t change, only the enemie’s health.
Call me old fashioned but a Muton shouldn’t have more health than a Sectopod, quadrupedal tank. But on commander oh boy they do.
There is no intended difficulty unlike in classic X-com or Enemy unknown. Play around with it.
Find a comfortable balance between your damage output and the enemy’s strength.

[h2] It has the spirit of X-Com [/h2]

It's no secret that a bunch of X-Com fans rejected [strike] Two & Chimera Squad [/strike] because it betrayed the core themes of the franchise.
The indomitable human spirit adapting and overcoming Alien, Lovecraftian and interdimensional threats. A rag tag group of rainbow resistance warriors isn’t X-com.
The idea that we’re in waters so uncharted that despite have an entire facility, bureau, military or even a full-on megacity at your disposal. And you’re still on the backfoot is X-Com. It’s the best of the best having to rise beyond their limitations to save humanity. It shouldn’t be a plucky underdog story.
It’s a war of attrition between the best & brightest and the horrors of the uknown.

The Bureau, X-Com declassified [i] gets [/i] this. It understands the necessity of having an established facility which is impressive considering there is zero research or base management. 

Everyone around you is a highly trained professional from various background selected to defend humanity. It’s X-Com with a little more personality and a stronger than average narrative. 
Is it a good narrative? 
Eh, it has major pacing issues. There are only 7 mainline and 7 optional missions. But it doesn’t playout as predictably as the classics or Enemy Unknown does, someone was having fun writing this and whilst its brevity takes away from the intended emotional impact… 
It has more going on than most 7th gen shooters. 

[h2] The none existent technical hic-ups [/h2]

A lot of people state this game doesn’t run on windows 11.
I have the dreaded 24H2 build and it runs perfectly. [b] First time booting the game did take several minutes [/b] but every start up afterwards was immediate.
I’m running an Integrated RTX 3050 4gb, hardly cutting edge stuff for the 2020’s and the game ran with out a single crash.
The cutscenes are pre-recorded in 720p with some terrible compression. It looks bad.

There is full controller support right out of the box, plays well with my 3rd party Xbox One controller. No issues.
The texture work is surprisingly great, you can read almost all the chalkboards, posters and graffiti present in the environments. It adds to the conspiracy latent atmosphere the game is striving for.

[h2] It’s well worth it when on a sale [/h2]

For $2 of $5 it’s a fun little distraction, it’s hardly the betrayal Spoony [Godspeed my sweet prince, find the help you need] led me to believe it was back in 2012.
It’s far from the worst entry in the franchise.
Sure, if Alliance was playable this would be a redundant entry (Unless you really liked the cold war aesthetic) but as some one who brought this after sinking 150+ hours into Enemy within in the space of two weeks, yeah this has the X-Com spirit I yearn for. 

10-15 Hours of gameplay, if you get the DLC then I could see 20 at a push. There is no new game plus or randomly generated missions everything in this game was purposely designed which is something of a lost art now-a-days.

I will add the marketing for this game did it no favours, like seriously. This isn’t a bad game it’s just that everything surrounding it, including its marketing absolutely betrayed it. Heh. I guess there was betrayal after all. | Para mi es un juego clásico de Xbox 360, con una muy buena historia y opciones de juego. 
 | It's not a bad game. The story is set in an alternate timeline to the mainline games, and you get to experience the conflict from another perspective. Too bad we don't see [i]all[/i] the enemy types, and the forced squad management is more annoying than helpful, but it's not a complete disaster.

Do note, that there are technical issues with this game on modern hardware: PhysX tanks your performance even when it works, high frame rates will make you stumble on level geometry, some triggers may fail to trigger, so you'd stuck and will have to restart from a checkpoint. | Really bad dialogue. I thought I'd be able to ignore it and just enjoy the gameplay, but there are big sections of dialogue where the characters are rude to their coworkers and allies for no reason. They're not rude in a funny or entertaining way, just randomly mean. | World and story is decent, but the gameplay is just boring and dated now."
76561198082086866,241600,Rogue Legacy,0.31666666666666665,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG",0,"Fun Fact: This game actually coined the term ""Roguelite"", to describe Roguelike elements while not actually fitting into the mold of the genre, which is actually a set of rules determined by Roguelike developers of yore in an event called the ""Berlin Convention"". This game is most-assuredly not an actual Roguelike, which is why ""Rogue-LITE"" is used in the marketing material, because it was a brand new term and style of game at the time.

Most games people call ""Roguelikes"" don't actually meet the real criteria, and this has been a source of annoyance for actual Roguelike fans like me for over a decade, since the Roguelite boom, which this game is partially responsible for along with Binding of Isaac. I like Roguelites a lot, this isn't a slight against the genre, but people SERIOUSLY need to distinguish them better.

If you want to know what a real Roguelike looks like, the Genesis game Fatal Labyrinth, the Game Gear version Dragon Crystal, Nethack, Caves of Qud, Angband, Path of Achra, Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead, Quasimorph, Tales of the Maj'Eyal, ADOM, why yes I did just skim Sseth's channel to remember half of these names.

What these games all have in common, are grid-based maps, being turn based, permadeath, zero progression between runs, (""metaprogression"" being out of run progression), a strong focus on being non-modal. meaning every action you can do is always available, peaceful options rarely exist, procedurally generated levels make up most of the game, and ""emergent gameplay"" is prioritized, meaning you have a ton of out-of-the-box options that are all generally accounted for in normal gameplay.

I actually grew up with the 3DS VC version of Dragon Crystal and the PS3 Genesis disc that had Fatal Labyrinth on it. Although, gonna be honest, I played more Dragon Crystal, and when I was playing the PS3 Genesis disc, I was playing Shinobi 3 and Streets of Rage 2, a true classic. That reminds me though, the stellar Phantasy Star 1-4 was also on that disc, and also, the PS2 Shinobi reboot and it's sequel Nightshade are actually peak, despite getting sub-par reviews for the time. Time was very kind to those games despite their insane difficulty, and I don't think I'll have another opportunity to mention those games unless Sega puts them on Steam or something.

Less faithful to the original criteria, but still great examples are the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games, the other Mystery Dungeon spinoffs, and also Shiren The Wanderer by the same team, which has 2 releases on Steam. Also another strange example of a Roguelike is FF X-2 Last Mission, a pack-in on the HD releases of FF X+X-2, in case getting the previously PAL/JP-only vastly superior re-release version of FF X with 14 extra bosses and a better, much more open, Sphere Grid wasn't enough of a bonus.

Rogue Legacy is a very good Roguelite, and it still holds up. As you can see by my playtime, this game was a staple for me in high school, and I still come back to this game and it's sequel. The ""Neo"" fights in this game are entirely unbalanced, but otherwise this game is very, very good. The Donation Box was a new feature to make the ""Neo"" fights less crushing, and it does help a lot, but the big problem is a lot of the Neo fights require playing against your play-style. The equivalents in the sequel are much better, since instead of having set strategies you're required to learn, it's a test of how well you can clear them as each class.

Class dichotomy is also not as good in this game as in it's sequel, and the disabilities provide no compensation like in the sequel. Rogue Legacy 2 is definitely a better game, but that doesn't mean this game is BAD. After all, the sequel came out 7 years later, and hindsight is 20/20. For a while, this was one of the best 2D Roguelites out there, before we got Dead Cells, which I played extremely late, and this game still has plenty of really good ideas, even if it has some design flaws.

A lot of those design flaws really don't become apparent until you've already beaten the game and are on NG+++, so in that regard, Cellar Door succeeded at making a sufficiently well-designed game. Also, as a bonus, Cellar Door included a copy of a fan-made overhaul mod, Lament of Zors, to the game, with permission, as an alternative launch option, and that fan-made mod is very interesting and adds a lot of new areas to the game, and rebalances a lot.

In short, the sequel is a better game, but this is still a great game to come back to, even with the sequel existing. I recommend this game wholeheartedly. I know half the text here ended up talking about other games, and the distinction between Roguelite and Roguelike, but there's not really too much to say about this game itself other than that it's a well-designed action platformer responsible for the Roguelite boom. | Mon temps de jeu parle de lui-même. 
Au fil des années, Rogue Legacy est devenu un de mes jeux conforts. Quand j'avais un petit moment, et pas envie de me lancer dans une grande aventure, je relançais une run, souvent deux, trois, quatre, car le Rogue-Like est spécialement addictif. 
Et puis voilà, 10ans après l'avoir lancé pour la première fois, je viens de le 100%, avec un plaisir inégalé à parcourir les 4 biomes et à en buter tous les ennemis tout en récupérant mon précieux argent. Aucune lassitude ne s'est jamais fait ressentir chez moi, seulement de la frustration parfois, dont j'étais le seul responsable, mort par orgueil d'avoir voulu faire une salle trop difficile, ou d'avoir relancé une run de trop. Le jeu est dur, mais juste. Un vrai bijou du Rogue-lite- Plateforme. | I really liked the generational aspect of it, where you play as the various iterations on one bloodline.

A bit grindy on first playthrough but progresses much faster on NG+. I enjoy it despite having played the later CSD games and appreciating their different mechanical approaches to the same dishes and events, and I don't think the three games are truly redundant. The game is written much more seriously overall than the later games as well, though that's saying surprisingly little and ultimately the story is inconsequential here.

Game is soundly assembled and balanced and all the dishes are worth consideration. You will build a lot of keyboard APM playing this game and memorizing combos for further optimizations, though I know of those who prefer joystick controls and are nonetheless quite skilled. 

Everything looks and sounds delicious, and almost inspiring, for drawings and exaggerated sound clips but yeah a lot of recipes get oversimplified. You're going to be cooking entire lasagnas and entire pots of soup for individual patrons. I recommend that you don't buy blue stars until you beat the game. | [i]Cook, Serve, Delicious![/i] in one word: FAAASTERRR

This game is full of keyboard action and plays a lot like those niche typing games. But instead of reading and typing words, you're reading dish orders and inputting corresponding hotkeys at blistering pace and superb accuracy. And yes, you can customize hotkeys for all the dishes, which is pretty sweet. However, there are some notable limitations: the key to serve a dish has to be Enter, and you can only use letters, so [];',. etc. aren't allowed.

Every day that you do well, you get ""buzz"", i.e. the game speeds up. There's no significant bonus related to this other than that you get more customers and earn more money. Most importantly, it makes the game speed fit your skill level. So this is just good game design.

The game also has great humor. If you stay a bit in the intro, you get people saying Cook, Serve, Delicious in every way possible. The e-mails you receive every day are full of character and humor as well.

All that is to say, these developers really know what they're doing, and I look forward to getting 100% for this game! | It's funny going back how much simpler this is than its sequels
Not that that's bad | Very fun and enjoyable typing game, that makes good use of ingenious mechanics to add complexity to an otherwise simple concept. I especially liked how some recipes created a different flow on the keyboard, while presenting unique challenges you had to overcome. 

(I only played on extreme so the experience might be different on normal)

Pros:
- simple and easy to navigate UI (there are some weird menu interactions like how you have to go to the ""View/Buy Foods"" tab to test recipes, but there aren't that many and you get used to it)
- straightforward gameplay that also needs a bit of strategy to play well
- good humor
- music
- diverse and fun recipe cards
- challenging (I wouldn't say it's especially hard but you need to be able to touch type to have a good time)
- not annoying to get all achievements

Cons:
- a few annoying bugs (mostly in the UI)
- becomes repetitive after a while (especially the final star rating)
- difficulty is somewhat inverse if you play on extreme because you don't have any upgrades in the beginning
 - you can't discard a dish to redo it if you failed (its annoying when you miss a perfect day because your hand slipped and added the wrong ingredient in a single soup from like 100+ orders) | A very fun game. It can get a little dull when you have low buzz and consequently very few customers, then the next day you'll be mashing keys like crazy to get through a mad rush. Cool music and overall a great experience."

Не удивительно! | Once upon a time, there was a boy who travelled the world in search for knowledge and life experience. For close to 30 years he engaged in higher learning, met people from all walks of life, and expanded his horizons. People in his social circles thought this boy – now a man – learn to satiate his seemingly boundless curiosity. Little did they know that he harbours a dark secret.

For you see, this man’s inquisitiveness is driven by his ambition to prove that he knows Jack. The first several times in his youthful days he tried to show he knows Jack, he was humbled. Humiliated, he embarked on a scholarly journey to better himself; and now, he has returned to prove his mettle.

Upon seeing Jack again decades later, the man was nervous. Would his many years of training be all for naught? Just as he had feared, his first attempt in demonstrating he knows Jack did not go well. He had forgot how snarky and snide Jack could be. Undeterred, the man regained his composure and tried proving himself again.

Two rounds of questioning plus a final challenge later, the man succeeded – he proved he knows Jack! Though his triumph did not leave Jack speechless – something he doubted Jack would ever be – the man walked away with his head held up high. Years of training had paid off and the battle was won!

Just as the man was about to call it a day, he heard a voice call to him, “You may know the first Jack, but do you know the second?”

The man smirked in response and muttered to himself, [URL= https://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieLima79/recommended/259940 ]“There’s another Jack? Interesting…”[/URL] | Best advice:

Quicker game play than the full Digital Edition
Useful for learning the rules and character nuances in Talisman: Digital Edition



[u]Cons[/u]:

Can't save the game. They definitely need to fix this. (Seriously, Nomad, what [b]are[/b] you thinking here?)
Game play can get extremely redundant with only one character on the board.




[u]Verdict[/u]:

Worth buying when it goes on sale, [u]if[/u]:

* You already know you really want it
* The Digital Edition confuses you and you want to practice the nuances of the game
* You're a compulsive collector like me
* You're not going to bother with the Digital Edition anyway

If none of those apply, then I'd say don't bother. | Although, I bought two versions of Talisman (Prologue and Digital Edition), I started with this. Yes, I got a good experience, playing and learning different characters, their advantages. This helps me to know the game, its rules. But after some games, this solo adventure starts to bother me. Quests quite frankly aren't interesting. Often you need to get to some place or monster, and you roll dice one by one until you get exactly you need (Sometimes I spent more than 20-25 turns just only to be on the same space as my quest's task). I don't persuade to buy Talisman, but don't waste money, buy original Talisman: Digital Edition, where you get better experience, fun and enjoyment playing with friends or bots. There you will not only roll dices, but also think about your next steps. | Definitely a 'Prologue' (introduction) to the Talisman Digital Edition. Consider this to be a tutorial to the extreme, enough to be able to sell it seperately.

I consider it more of an occasional distraction, probably not one of those games that you feel like playing for hours on end...but one of those that you 'pull off of the shelf' here and there.

After playing Talisman Digital Edition, I will say that I did miss the quests. Ultimately, it could be cool to blend the two and introduce individual quests into the Digital Edition.

It seems that, at the least, Prologue will either be a quick distraction, or it will be one of those that you will enjoy here and there. (Obviously there is the possibility that it may just 'click' and it is played to completion).

In other words, for the price ... not too bad.  I enjoyed it so far, but for me it is here and there.  It would seem hard to go wrong if you can get it in a bundle or, as currently under a couple bucks. (I'm buying a couple extra as gifts ... can't go too wrong for that price and maybe they will go for the Digital Edition and we can do multiplayer...) | First let me say i wasnt aware of talisman till a few days ago and i have to be completely honest.
This is a must buy. im loving ever minute, and yes i too read all the mixed reviews and in part i agree.

but heres my way to decide if talismans for you.

1. buy the multi player version first (at writing this review it was on sale £1.67).full price around £5.

2. ( watch a few youtube vids on the game, & get a feel for the rules etc)

3. if you feel that this is your sort of game, then purchase the prologue.

This is in main a tutorial , dont worry to much about counting moves, just enjoy the ride that is talismam.
There are more than 50 quests, and the pros of this are you will get to really understand about how to build your chosen characters , get a taste of what possible rewards and pitfalls await you within the adventure card deck,which must be turned after every move and finally which squares of the board not to go to.

This is why its a must buy for anyone thats new to talisman.

(at time of review it was not on sale ) .

so at this point weve spent less than the price of a costa coffee & muffin (£7)

im old skool and this feels like your playing a adventure story novel, the dice will make or break you.
but im enjoying every minute playing and as i select every adventure card or spell card you will be like a kid opening a present. 

for the price you get a lot of fun for your bucks.
you dont have to dig deep and buy all the expansions right away.

theres plenty here to keep you going, for now.

i give prologue  a beast slaying, spell casting  8/10

The best way to find your gaming legs , which will only add to you enjoying the multiplayer game even more.





 | Il faut prendre ce jeu pour ce qu'il est : une initiation au ""monde"" de Talisman, le jeu de plateau. Et il faut avouer que la réalisation graphique/rendu est très satisfaisante à quelques détails près.

C'est un jeu où le hasard a une place importante, c'est d'ailleurs ce qui en fait en partie son charme. On pourrai comparer au jeu de l'Oie pour les déplacements (on est obligé de se déplacer du nombre demandé), les mécaniques ensuite font beaucoup penser à celles des jeux de rôles d'univers Médiéval Fantastique. 

J'ai trouvé celà plaisant mais pas exeptionnel (en Solo). Cette version permet de découvrir le système et après avoir testé les quêtes de quelques personnages on cherchera sans aucun doute autre chose. L'intéret de ce jeu est plus dans le multijoueur.

La version Solo qu'est Talisman : Prologue, m'a donné envie de m'intéresser au ""vrai"" jeu de plateau. Avec mes enfants, et leurs amis, ce serai sans doute un bon compromis face aux autres jeux de société plus classiques."

If you love the board game (and I do) you won't be disappointed with this version | I really wanted to like this game, even if it is based on a board game that is really old. The early aspects I found quite enjoyable, moving around the board, facing encounters, and getting stronger. Two aspects of this game just killed it for me: PVP and the end game. Essentially, I see no real reason to do anything but a strength character. Craft lets you get around a little easier at times, but strength can just steamroll everything, and if a caster has to PVP a strength character, they lose. The end game is nothing but luck. I spent nine rounds on the crown, and only twice did the command spell work. By then, two other strength players had reached me, and even with decent strength, it couldn't compete with those who had strength in double digits. It just killed the whole experience for me, as I had no method to win. Even the others agreed how broken it was.

But unlike the first Jack, this second Jack seemed easier to figure out. In the man’s first attempt to show he knows this Jack, too, the man cut through the irreverence that came at him and triumphed effortlessly.

Flushed with confidence, and admittedly a touch of unbecoming arrogance, the man cast the second Jack aside like a clingy ex-girlfriend though it was admittedly fun to prove that he knows Jacks! Just as he thought about taking on his backlog of challenges that he had accumulated, he heard the voice calling him again.

The man, overconfident from his encounter with the second Jack, was thrown off his game by the third Jack’s steadfast confidence. This Jack’s irreverence, snide, and challenges slowly wore the man down.

Jack humbled the man, but thankfully not easily. The man, undeterred, regained his composure and answered another call for challenge. He will harness his years of life experience and training to prove he knows Jacks!

And humbled Jack the man did in his second attempt, and he did so resoundingly. The third Jack, weakened from his challenge with the man, uttered wearily, “This is not over.

Você passa um bom tempo jogando como se ele fosse um jogo qualquer, quando na verdade o rumo que se deve ter é completamente diferente. Darkest Dungeon é uma das minhas experiências mais difíceis que eu tive nos últimos anos com jogos. A jogabilidade é extremamente punitiva, nociva caso não saiba o que está fazendo. Um dos núcleos do jogo, é o dinheiro. É necessário entrar nas missões (dungeons), se importar com fazer dinheiro, sua sobrevivência e ainda completar o seu objetivo. Conciliar todos esses fatores, transforma a experiência em um ciclo maçante de fazer dinheiro e upar personagens para o final do jogo. Penso que essa ferramenta utilizada para ser a ponte principal do Darkest Dungeon, pode ser bem mal vista para quem pensa em zerar o jogo.

Mas, além de tudo, gostaria de enaltecer a arte característica e virtuosa, que transmite perfeitamente a atmosfera obscura das dungeons, da sofrência e do medo. A direção artística voltada ao tema ""Lovecrafteana"", é muito bem feito, principalmente no que se diz progressão visual. Os ambientes se tornando mais medonhas cada vez que você vai progredindo para o final do jogo, a mudança de cores voltadas ao cosmo e carnificina ou até mesmo as músicas que passam de um violino arranhado e agitado para algo mais ""contemplador""

Por fim, vai minha dica:
- Se você quiser uma experiência menos massiva, jogue na dificuldade Radiante
- Caso queira sofrer um pouco mais, tendo que repetir missões para ficar mais forte, jogue na Mais Escura
- E se você for um mutante, jogue na mais difícil mesmo, é uma experiência semelhante a estar em um quarto branco com camisa de força no corpo | 新手上手不难，甚至比月计还简单一些，风格也熟悉，各位主管，司书，管理员必入 | This is a game I played on an off for years, and both loved it and grew frustrated by it as I played.  This last year I decided it was time to beat the game finally, so I dedicated a bit more of my gaming time to it, and feel I can give some fairly informed thoughts on the game.  

Darkest Dungeon has a fun party management system that is well designed and the heart and soul of the game.  Do you select your ranged skills for your Highwayman so he can be in position 3?  Or do you take his pos 1/2 skills and play more of a high risk high reward style of play up front?  Do you put your jester in the back making him a buffing character?  Or do you put him further forward so you can apply bleed and be more of a DPS character?  It allows you to make a lot of different parties in different ways, and as you play you learn what combo's works best for each situation, and which ones you prefer to play.  

The enemies also have positions that work differently for each enemy type, and some of your characters will let you manipulate the positions of your enemies to mess them up or put them in a position for one of your other characters to pummel them into the dirt.   So overall the game play is EXCELLENT.

Where I had my struggles with the game was losing characters.  When I first started playing the game it really hurt to lose that Leper that I had been using effectively for so many dives into the dungeon.  I eventually learned that dying is an important aspect of the game, and if you upgrade your stagecoach you will be just fine.  The death of the characters also adds weight to your decisions in the game.  If you decide to get too crazy with a party/skill composition there is a very real chance you are going to lose some of your characters.  So if you decide to play Darkest dungeon just accept right off the bat that death is part of the grim dark theme of the game.

The other aspect of the game that people may not like is the tone and atmosphere of the game.  It is a grim dark themed horror game.  Horror is not really my jam to be honest, but the game play and how the theme is executed, and the great narration of the game drew me in despite my lack of interest in the horror genre.  

Overall the game play is excellent, and the setting, style and art of the game is unique and intriguing.  I would highly recommend this to people looking for a great rogue like dungeon crawler that stands out in an over crowded market."

It's got charm but doesn't even last one level mode playthrough IMO. The game also becomes an insanely tedious grind if you want to 100% it or try to get survival mode high scores.  [/h1]

[h3] Actual Review [/h3]
This is one of those games that just boils down to having good (and eventually impossible) reaction time. The developer's description of ""to be played in short bursts"" is the most accurate way to describe OFDP. So already knowing that, I have no idea why they decided to add 152 achievements to this game, and over half of those being grind-based ones. Avoid OFDP if you 100% games, it completely destroys any and all fun you will have with it. The only reason I went for 100% was because I have lots of downtime at work. The most fun way to play the game is ignore the entire medal/perfect system and all achievements and just go through the level mode until you get bored. There's cool skills you unlock as you progress, and you can make some pretty cool builds for the different game types.

As soon as you try to do any extra completion past the first few dozens levels, you realize that the game suffers from ""death by 1000 paper cuts"". I really hate trashing this game because it was literally a two man dev team and obviously born out of passion for Hong Kong action movies. However, when you add medals, achievements, and game modes that requires understanding and perfecting absolutely everything about the gameplay, it's impossible to ignore all the little flaws that whittles away at this game over time.

[h3] Core Gameplay [/h3]
The actually gameplay is simplistic yet solid. controls feel responsive and combat feels fluid. You gotta get into a flow state to be able to tackle the higher difficulties but it feels pretty good to come out on top. The very first thing you'll notice however that gets annoying is the dynamic speed gauge. The better you do at levels, the faster your speed gauge will increase. Do bad or lose and it goes down. You will eventually have to farm losing at multiple points to keep the speed down, because past like 150% speed the game just gets more and more unplayable and you're better off manually lowering it to a playable level rather than slowly have it increase or decrease naturally.

The second thing you'll notice which will probably become your biggest complain with the game, is the seemingly random slo-mo. Now it's not actually random, but rather triggered by power smashes and knocking enemies into the background props. Ok that makes sense - but are you really going to track bodies to see if they will trigger slo-mo? No of course not. You'll be too busy focusing on the stream of oncoming enemies. Because of that, your timing will be frequently throw off. You will miss enemies that would've been in range and then get hit for it.

Thirdly, there is this really weird bug that causes your thrown objects to teleport to you if it's midair and a color enemy gets between you and it. It's like objects have a giant hitbox connecting it to your character. Weapons, projectiles, even the ball of death has this bug. This will almost always cause you to get hit unless you are fast enough to see it coming. It's especially bad with bombs because they're slow. I cannot tell you how many attempted perfect rounds i've had to restart because of it.

[h3] Level Mode [/h3]
So first off before I even say anything at all: level mode is SO LONG HOLY SHIT. There's a lot of diverging paths and probably around 150 levels. But even if you take the shortest path to the final boss (which btw is just a normal boss round) it's still like 50 levels of the same 8 game types that just get longer and longer.

So after going through level mode on student you unlock master mode and an extra skill slot. After master is grandmaster with another extra skill slot. The only difference in the modes is the number and speed of enemies per round. The higher modes hit you with INSANE numbers of enemies which only get faster as the rounds progress. So it's not only tedious but also difficult.

So if you wanna go for achievements after level mode, after unlocking the fifth skill slot you go back and start grinding each level's medals. You get a perfect for not getting hit during a round, and a platinum medal for never missing. And to make the grind extra fun, the heal skill (as well as deflect color/grey) don't save you. So even if you heal to full by the end of the round you still won't get perfect. Also thankfully there are only achievements for getting a set number of medals. Oh my god if there was an achievement for getting all medals on every level on every difficulty, it probably would be the rarest achievement on steam period. The final few lightsword rounds on grandmaster alone are probably humanly impossible to perfect.

Speaking of the lightsword/nunchaku rounds(they're the same thing), they will be your bane for medal farming. The speed ramp up is insane and the final enemy is a brawler which means after the entire round you have to either trial and error memorize the attack pattern, or hope your reflexes are fast enough. The background for these levels are also very distracting and can throw off your focus.

[h3] Survival Mode/Mastery Score [/h3]
Ok so you've finished all the medal stuff, now it's time for survival mode. There are a lot of kill related achievements for each of the three modes, and i'll come out and say it right now that the high kill achievements are fucking STUPID. You will be farming these for way way WAY longer than you will care for. The basic survival mode one, while still really hard, is at least straightforward. The dumb ones are blind and no luca no modes.

Blind is just survival but without your attack range bar and color enemies don't show their hit directions. So good luck memorizing what each color's pattern is while also being fast enough to distinguish them at 3000+ kills where their speed is stupid high.

No luca no is a reference to an earlier game by the devs, where a cat appears and blocks one side of the screen so you need to swipe it off the screen. This mode will force you to seamlessly integrate a new, unintuitive layer to your muscle memory that will get you killed over and over. I also (thankfully) encountered a bug where for whatever reason, Luca kept spawning on one side of the screen, so I could just hold that direction to keep Luca away. This is how I got the high kill achievement in this mode but I'm not sure how to replicate it. Not even sure if I would be able to beat it had that not happened.

After survival you'll need to mop up the remaining mastery score for the 20mil achievement. You can go back to finish every level on every difficulty for about another 4-5 million. Also worth mentioning is the fact that getting perfect or medals don't add to your mastery score, the only thing that matters is keeping your combo up. I don't know exactly how it works, but my guess is there's some combo timer that you need to keep hitting enemies for it to not reset, so you'll want to play on the highest speed you can to keep enemies from becoming spread out. The absolute GREATEST thing about this too is this invisible combo timer doesn't seem to scale with the slo-mo. So any brawler fights, power smashes/dodges or prop smashing will just drop your combo. So yeah, one final bit of tedium before you complete it sums up the game pretty perfectly.

[h3] OFDP is Still Amazing if you Avoid Completing it [/h3]
You still should grab this game on sale if you pace your time with it. It's still got charm and at the end of the day you can't really be that mad at the game because for what it is, it's not bad. Imposing completion-related stuff on it should not have happened in my opinion but if you ignore all that and just play on and off, it's a great time. 6/10 | cant actually make it work on 2 screens.

Ah yes, [b]Goat Simulator[/b], the game that boldly asks, ""[i]What if a goat could headbutt reality itself?[/i]"" If you've ever woken up and thought, ""[i]I want to wreak havoc as a physics-defying goat,[/i]"" then congratulations – your oddly specific dream is now a reality.  

This is not just a game; it's a [b]life experience[/b]. Forget saving kingdoms, fighting dragons, or becoming a space marine – you're a goat, and your only mission is to turn everything into absolute chaos. Climb ladders with your nonexistent hands, lick random objects (because goats apparently have magnetic tongues), and launch yourself into orbit because physics in this universe took a permanent vacation.  

[hr]  
[b]Highlights:[/b]  

[b]Story:[/b] There isn’t one. You’re a goat. Make your own story. Maybe you’re a disgruntled farm animal on a quest for revenge. Or maybe you’re just vibing in a world where everything explodes when you touch it.  

[b]Graphics:[/b] Stunningly realistic… if the world was designed by someone who just discovered ragdoll physics and said, ""[i]More. MORE![/i]""  

[b]Gameplay:[/b] Imagine playing Skyrim but with no quests, no objectives, and way more headbutting. It’s perfect for people who enjoy the feeling of total anarchy without consequences.  

[b]Soundtrack:[/b] Mostly goat bleats, explosions, and the sweet sound of destruction. It’s beautiful.  

[b]Replayability:[/b] Endless. Every time you boot it up, you’ll find a new, equally absurd way to destroy everything around you.  

[hr]  
[b]Pros:[/b]  
- You can become a demon goat, a robot goat, or even a goat that’s somehow a giraffe. Truly revolutionary character customization.  
- Break the laws of physics with zero remorse.  
- There’s a multiplayer mode, because why wreak havoc alone when you can bring friends?  

[b]Cons:[/b]  
- None. It’s a flawless work of art. (Okay, maybe it crashes sometimes, but let’s call that a feature.)  

[hr]  
[b]Final Thoughts:[/b]  

[b]Goat Simulator[/b] is not the game we deserve, but it’s the game we needed. It’s a love letter to chaos, and it reminds us all that sometimes, you just need to let loose and headbutt a car for no reason.

У біблійній традиції, зокрема у Книзі розробників, описується створення світу Coffee Stain Studios протягом шести днів, кожен з яких має свої специфічні події. Ось короткий огляд того, що сталося кожного з цих тижнів: [/b]
[hr][/hr]

[i] [h1] Тиждень 1: [/h1]
    • Coffee Stain Studios придумав Козла, відділив його від темряви персонажів, створивши концепцію безумства та гри
      [hr][/hr]
[h1] Тиждень 2: [/h1]
    • Coffee Stain Studios створив ігрову твердь та небо, поділивши води над твердю від вод під твердю так і створили біом.
      [hr][/hr]
[h1] Тиждень 3: [/h1]
    • Coffee Stain Studios зібрав всі ідеї скинув в одне місце і перемішав, відкривши безумство як рушійну силу, яку назвав ""Goat Simulator"", а зібрані напрацювання — «Хороший документ з дизайну». Він також створив рослинність: трави, рослини, що приносять віртуальні плоди та дерева, що несуть графічне насіння.
      [hr][/hr]
[h1] Тиждень 4: [/h1]
    • Coffee Stain Studios виставив світло, написали кодом, місця переміщення між локаціями та фізику предметів.
      [hr][/hr]
[h1] Тиждень 5: [/h1]
    • Coffee Stain Studios населив землю не розумними людино — істотами та створив птахів, що літають над землею. Він благословив цих створінь, щоб бігали та удавали, що наче живі.
      [hr][/hr]
[h1] Тиждень 6: [/h1]
    • Coffee Stain Studios створив наземних тварин, скрипти поведінки, плагіни та, нарешті, Козла за Своїм образом(бо головний гейм дизайнер у Компанії дійсно козел, іншого я не придумав пояснення). Він дав Козлу владу над усіма функціями по ігровому світу та у небі. [/i]
      [hr][/hr]
[h1] Після цих шести тижнів творення, Coffee Stain Studios зібрали вечірку на сьомий тиждень, після того, як портували гру на всі можливі платформи. І стали збирати хайп, хейт та зелених президентів. [/h1]

[b] ""Goat Simulator"" від студії Coffee Stain Studios — це відеогра, що вийшла у 2014 році, яка відразу ж стала культовим явищем завдяки своїй абсурдності та нестандартному підходу до геймплею.
[hr][/hr]

Графіка в ""Goat Simulator"" навмисно недосконала, що є частиною її чарівності (бо гра надихає на створення ігор з необмеженим потенціалом, використовуючи конструктор Unreal Engine чи Unity). Це не зусилля на висококласну візуалізацію, а скоріше нагадування про старі, менш потужні ігри(що є актуальними та хорошими іграми крізь роки: [url=store.steampowered.com/app/40800/Super_Meat_Boy/] Super Mario Bros, The Legend of Zelda, Minecraft, [/url]  [url=store.steampowered.com/app/24780/SimCity_4_Deluxe_Edition/] SimCity [/url] , [url=store.steampowered.com/developer/civilization]  Civilization [/url] , [url=store.steampowered.com/app/455400/PACMAN_256/]  Pac-Man [/url] , Street Fighter, [url=store.steampowered.com/curator/34459938]  Final Fantasy [/url] , [url=store.steampowered.com/curator/35501448]  Doom [/url] , [url=store.steampowered.com/app/2114810/Tetris_Girls/]  Tetris [/url] ).Моделі персонажів, особливо кози, виконані з гумором, і всілякі недоліки в анімації додають грі комічного ефекту. Ігровий світ виглядає як мініатюра справжнього світу, з його фізикою, що часто призводить до кумедних ситуацій.(не баг, а фіча).

Суть гри полягає в тому, щоб бути Козлом, у всіх сенсах, можна робити майже все, що завгодно, без жодної мети або сюжету. Ви можете стрибати, літати, руйнувати об'єкти, вчиняти хаос. Фізика в грі часто поводиться непередбачувано(чого варті тільки стрибки та використання язика), що робить кожну сесію гри унікальною. Є різні режими гри, які додають різноманітності, але суть залишається тією ж — творити безлад.

Очень странно сделана система продвижения то есть не понятно как игра понимает когда тебе должна попасться крутая вещь, а когда ещё рано, если в террарии это происходило после убийства боссов/получения новой руды то тут тебе чисто может повезти выбить с сундука крутой меч или нет (только с одного босса даётся нормальное оружие). Также многие станции для крафта попросту не применяются больше половины игры, мне наковальня понадобилась лишь для улучшения наспинного балона или что это.

[quote][i]Всем привет. Автор не несет ответственности за причиненный вред своими обзорами. Любое сходство с другими обзорами случайно. Данный обзор является лишь мнением автора и вы можете всегда оставаться при своем мнении! Спасибо за понимание и приятной игры![/i][/quote]

[h1]Описание:[/h1]
[i][b]Stellaris[/b] — это смесь грандиозной 4X-стратегии, ролевой игры и интерактивного романа, где вы сами пишете историю своего народа среди звёзд. Разработчики создали  эпическое повествование о взлётах и падениях цивилизации. От первых робких шагов в космосе до управления межгалактической империей — здесь есть место всему: дипломатии, войнам, предательствам и открытиям, которые перевернут ваше представление о жанре.[/i]

[b]Основа игры: Механики, которые затягивают на сотни часов[/b]
[i][list]
[*] [b]Создание своей цивилизации:[/b] Stellaris начинается с того, что вы буквально конструируете расу из десятков параметров: этика (милитаристы, пацифисты, ксенофобы), тип общества (биологическое, роботы, псионики), черты (адаптивность, интеллект, агрессия) и даже внешность. Хотите играть за миролюбивых космических слизней, строящих галактическую федерацию? Или за машинную империю, стремящуюся ассимилировать все органические расы? Здесь возможно всё.

[*] [b]Исследование и открытия:[/b] Галактика в Stellaris генерируется случайно, и каждое новое игра — это путешествие в неизвестность. Вы будете:
- Исследовать аномалии (например, древние руины или гравитационные аномалии).
- Встречать кризисы (вторжение внегалактических захватчиков, восстание синтетиков).
- Заключать союзы или уничтожать соседей.

[*] [b]Дипломатия и войны:[/b] 
- Дипломатия: От торговых соглашений до создания федераций — здесь можно решать судьбы галактики без единого выстрела.
- Войны: Система военных целей позволяет вести не тотальные войны, а конфликты с чёткими задачами (захват системы, освобождение вассала).
- Шпионаж и провокации: Саботаж, кража технологий, поддержка повстанцев — идеально для любителей «тихих» конфликтов.

[*] [b]Экономика и управление:[/b] 
- Балансировка ресурсов (энергия, минералы, пища, потребительские товары) — основа процветания.
- Планирование заселения планет, строительство мегасооружений (кольцевые миры, сферы Дайсона) и управление населением с уникальными потребностями.
[/list][/i]

[i][b]Сильные стороны: Почему Stellaris покоряет сердца[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]Нарративная глубина:[/b] События в игре — это не просто текст, а истории с последствиями. Например, обнаружение «Храмового комплекса» может привести к пробуждению древнего бога-червя, который переформатирует вашу расу, или к гибели всего живого в секторе.

[*] [b]Реиграбельность:[/b] Благодаря случайной генерации галактики, сотням событий и возможности создавать уникальные цивилизации, каждая партия кардинально отличается от предыдущей.

[*] [b]Моддерская поддержка:[/b] Stellaris обладает одной из самых активных моддерских сообществ. Моды добавляют новые расы, сюжеты, механики и даже полностью меняют сеттинг.

[*] [b]Постоянное развитие:[/b] Paradox регулярно обновляет игру, исправляя ошибки и добавляя новые фичи. Даже спустя 7 лет после релиза Stellaris остаётся актуальной.
[/list][/i]

[h1]Плюсы:[/h1]
[i][list]
[*] [b]Беспрецедентная свобода творчества:[/b] Создавайте уникальные расы с собственной этикой, чертами и историей. Хотите играть за пацифистов-грибов или машин-уничтожителей? Всё возможно. Проработанная система происхождений (например, «Потерянная колония» или «Синтетическая эволюция») задаёт тон всей партии.

[*] [b]Нарративная глубина:[/b] Сотни случайных событий, археологических цепочек и кризисов превращают игру в космическую сагу. Истории в духе научной фантастики: от восстания ИИ до встречи с божественными червями.

[*] [b]Реиграбельность:[/b] Случайная генерация галактики, разные типы кризисов (вторжение Пожирателей, Восстание машин) и бесконечные комбинации рас обеспечивают уникальность каждой партии.

[*] [b]Дипломатия и взаимодействие:[/b] От создания федераций до подрывных операций — здесь есть инструменты для любой стратегии. Возможность играть без войн, побеждая через культурное доминирование или политические интриги.

[*] [b]Моддерская поддержка:[/b] Огромная библиотека модов: от новых рас и кораблей до полных переработок вселенной (например, «Star Trek» или «Warhammer 40K»).

[*] [b]Атмосферность:[/b] Эпичный саундтрек, стилистика кораблей и планет, голосовые оповещения — всё это погружает в атмосферу живой галактики.

[*] [b]Постоянное развитие:[/b] Paradox регулярно обновляет игру, добавляя новые механики и исправляя ошибки.

[*] [b]Достижения:[/b] Присутствие получения различных достижений, что добавляет элемент соревновательности и мотивации с другими игроками которые смогли получить сложные достижения с особыми условиями.

[*] [b]Коллекционные предметы:[/b] Присутствуют обои, смайлики, карточки из которых можно скрафтить значки
[/list][/i]

[h1]Минусы:[/h1]
[i][list]
[*] [b]Высокий порог вхождения:[/b] Десятки ресурсов, технологий и механик могут перегрузить новичков. Обучение в игре поверхностное.

[*] [b]Проблемы с оптимизацией:[/b] На поздних стадиях игра начинает лагать, особенно в больших галактиках. Мультиплеер часто страдает от десинхронизации.

[*] [b]Дисбаланс механик:[/b] Некоторые стратегии (например, спам роботами или «танкирование» инфляции) остаются неоправданно сильными. ИИ часто действует нелогично: мирные империи внезапно объявляют войны, а ксенофобы предлагают союзы.

[*] [b]Повторяемость:[/b] После 100+ часов цепочки событий и диалоги начинают повторяться. Кризисы следуют одним и тем же сценариям.

[*] [b]Зависимость от DLC:[/b] Без дополнений (например, Utopia или Apocalypse) игра ощущается неполной. Многие «крутые» фичи (кольцевые миры, титаны) locked за платными DLC.

[*] [b]Ограниченная роль личности:[/b] Лидеры и фракции слабо влияют на игру. Их смерть или смена редко меняют курс империи.
[/list][/i]

[h1]Заключение:[/h1]
[i]Stellaris — это не просто игра. Это симулятор бесконечности, где каждая звезда может стать домом для новой цивилизации, а каждый чёрный ящик — хранить секреты, способные изменить галактику. Да, здесь есть проблемы с балансом и оптимизацией, но когда ваш флот из тысяч кораблей вступает в бой с внегалактическими захватчиками под эпичную музыку, вы понимаете: это не просто код и спрайты. Это — настоящее космическое приключение.[/i]

Всем добра, удачи и приятной игры! ^_^[/i] | Essentially a spreadsheet simulator in which you're just trying to make sure that you have the biggest or best numbers around. If you're meticulous and enjoy micromanaging, this is a great game to play. The mods for this game are also amazing! I highly recommend checking out the steam workshop for this game if you ever feel like vanilla starts to get kinda stale. And while this is my most played game, I DO NOT RECOMMEND GETTING THIS GAME FULL PRICE. Frequently this game goes on sale for like 75% and the base game alone is not worth the price tag especially as a lot of features that most Stellaris players like messing with are behind DLCs so unless there's some part of the game that you're desperate to play with I'd get the base game and any interesting DLC while they're on sale. | 肥肠好的游戏，使我的巨像旋转，之前玩的盗版，现在终于史低补票（仅本体）了，但P社的DLC是真贵，只能用学习版，等有钱了慢慢补票吧。 | So this is exactly the type of multiple month game time negative review that gets screen shot and memed on social media, but I'm sad to say I mean it in the most literal sense.  I have enjoyed much of my play time with Stellaris, but I emphatically don't recommend anyone purchase this game in it's current, maximum DLC form.
When this game launched, it was a refreshingly basic 4X. Most of the changes made in the early years all the way to the Nemesis expansion added meaningfully to the gameplay without making it overwhelming and complicated for new players.  Unfortunately recent patches and expansions have unfortunately been hats on hats, mostly adding complexity without adding fun.  I have enjoyed the ride for the most part, but like most Paradox games the continual addition of DLC eventually replaces the game you loved with something you barely recognize while draining your wallet."

My teammate clocked in 146 hours and I'm over 50 so perhaps ignore the positive reviews that show the person installed it and ran the title screen over people like me that actually put some time in. Sadly the fact this game is even still listed on Steam reenforces the feeling that over the last 2 years Steam has gone from a solid platform for good games into an unchecked and uncontrolled shovelware factory for novice made indie garbage.

Funny a friend introduced me to this game maybe two years back because he was friends with one of the devs. Comically over time said unnamed dev grew tired of some of the BS going on with the leads decision making which becomes a large part of this review.

When I first played the game it was actually fun. There was a lot of potential despite being extremely rough. I was part of one of the first teams to play the game for cash as competitive eSports players, something I hadn't done in a long time. However despite the potential the net code alone made even simple practice with teammates brutal if not impossible.

We gave feed back, the team ignored it. Each release the game got worse and worse with a clear focus on skins, visuals and other garbage they planned to monetize rather than making the game work. Believe it or not the net code got worse as it became clear the team really had no idea what they were doing when it came to networking. So rather than fix the match making and network issues they changed the menus, added new sounds and other pointless crap that didn't matter because you rarely could join a game and when you did you'd probably get disconnected at some point anyhow.

There were so many problems and I wrote about them on my teams website and various other places for the devs to review but jump ahead it looks like they gave up much like the majority of the player base who they alienated during feed back sessions and the tournaments they put on.

All in all it's quite sad to have seen the potential and then to watch them flush it. More so it's incomprehensible they would charge you $208.96 even if the game was complete and rock solid. That's like three or four triple A games or a crappy beater car for an unfinished no name game! | adorei

also the music in this game is a lot better than it is in the second, much more industrial and gritty, plus no shitty korn-ripoff vocals talking about abortion and god. the audio design in general is just better imo... guns sound amazing. even the 9mm has a punchy and satisfying sound that never gets old, say what you want about tripwire but they know how to make guns sound, look, and FEEL great, red orchestra 2 is a great example of that. 

also, this game is not afraid to punish you with some hefty recoil, which is really nice and adds a solid challenge. i wouldn't call the gunplay ""realistic"" but it is close enough that it feels pretty damn good. the devs managed to make you feel weak at times, but also strong and badass as hell at other points. shooting the patriarch's limbs off with dual handcannons never gets old."

The way you earn cards is the same, the ranked system is the same, the mana system is the same and the way classes work is the same, complete with special power.

However, there's a few very key differences between the two games that make Duelyst less random and, to me at least, more fun: The board on which you play as well as the ability to replace a card from your hand once per turn.

The board in combination with the various cards makes for some really deep and satisfying tactical play that allows you to bend the game to your favour with smart decisions. Every turn the board looks different as there's so much going on and every turn has a very large amount of decisions that you can make. I really enjoy this the most as a fervent tactical turn-based gamer. If you like the combat in XCOM and Age of Wonders 3, you will find lots to love here.

Other plusses are the quick matchmaking, the active developers, the gorgeous pixel art and animations and the large amount of interesting lore.

I am personally not a fan of random stuff (which is why I stopped playing Hearthstone) and to me Duelyst strikes the perfect balance between randomness and tactics. Highly recommended! | Abosultely love this game! The strategy needed due to the infinite possibilities between the game board, placement of ""cards"", and of course the kick @$$ pixel graphics!!  A very satisfying game that could easily be played and enjoyed without spending a penny of ""real money"".  The daily quests (and free card) can get you enough gold to buy spirit orbs (card packs), gauntlet tickets (arena/draft play) and bloodborn orbs (card packs with cards you DONT have!).  Yes, if you get a crate you need a key to open it which costs $4.99.. BUT they did recently implement a ""common crate"" key reward for 15 quests completed in a month (easy).  However, if you are worried that you will be missing out on items due to not wanting to buy crates they are mostly filled with cosmetic items with 1 card here and there so they are not required to complete your card collection. The last thing I want to touch on, which is one of my favorites, is the fact that each ""faction"" or class does not only have 1 type of general that has the same hero power no matter the skin or avatar.  There are multiple general (main hero/""face"") options for each faction AND your general always has at least 2 attack and can  move around the board like a chess piece, the same as your minions, instead of just being your avatar with a set power that never moves or defends themself without a weapon equipped.

To get the FULL experience and really find out I suggest you JUST PLAY IT.  Nothing to lose since it is F2P, the system requirements are low, and if you want to get a free spirit orb (or just 100 gold) use my referral code ""gdaddanyt"" and friend me to play some matches!! :) | i like the art work and you can't complain about the gameplay really. sure there are some people with awesome cards or decks, but its all about the strategy. it makes you think and it doesnt get boring. if it does, you can always come back to it later and appreciate the workers who put effort into making this game awesome. | Please support Chinese

Очень любил эту игру до того,как разработчики испортили её.Раньше все старались построить хорошие машины,выбрать те оружия,которые им по душе.Были Тиры,и каждый Тир был сбалансирован,не было через чур(были,но немного) сильный противников.Было Древо улучшений.А сейчас - разнацветные кубики,пыль,кейсы,игроки строят коробки на одной ножке или коробки с ротором и цепляют на него самые имбалансные пушки,которые выпали из купленных кейсов.Подбор противников просто ужасен.Игру облегчили для максимума(чтобы любой идиот,у которого есть деньги мог играть в это и донатить как можно больше) и превратили в помойку.Раньше было намного лучше.Разработчикам важен только донат,а не сама игра. | Uwaga! Opis mechanik gry jest już przestarzały(wyjaśnienie na końcu);

Dobry przykład jak ze świetnej gry zrobić totalnego gniota bez balansu nastawionego na grind i mikrotranzakcje wymuszające kupno premium by mieć jakąkolwiek szansę normalnego rozwoju konta. Gra kilka lat temu była świetna, przyjemny rozwój robotów, przyjemne walki, gra była nastawiona na umiejętności budowy robotów, co było bardzo ważną umiejętnością, a walka polegała na starannym niszczeniu najsłabszych punktów przeciwnika. Było trochę problemów z balansem, ale twórcy kompletnie nie potrafili ich naprawić mimo tego, że gracze pisali wielokrotnie co trzeba zmienić.

Twórcy wszystkie problemy zaczęli ""rozwiązywać"" od najgorszej strony, tworząc przy okazji nowe problemy. Z czasem gra straciła jakikolwiek sens posiadania umiejętności budowy, ponieważ teraz często liczy się kto pierwszy zaatakuje, a nie skill. Tutaj już nawet nie trzeba budować, twórcy dali możliwość kupowania robotów innych graczy, przez co nie ma sensu się starać, lepiej kupić potężnego bota aktualnej mety, po co budować, skoro wszystko i tak będzie gorsze? Tu też przychodzi drugi problem, balans. Zawsze był z tym problem, lecz kiedyś nie aż tak duży. Jak zwykle twórcy nie potrafią rozwiązywać problemów, przez to w grze jest pewna tzw. ""meta"", czyli najskuteczniejsze boty w grze. Przez idotyczne decyzje twórców ta liczba w tej chwili wynosi bodajże 3(tak, 3 typy robotów są skutecznie na wyższym poziomie umiejętności, reszta to strata nerwów i przegrywanie). Mobilność bota jest wszystkim ponieważ nawet najtwardsze boty topnieją w chwilę, więc nie ma sensu budować niczego innego. Chcesz pobawić się tworząc ładnie wyglądającego bota? Zapomnij, chyba, że nie masz nic przeciwko przegrywaniu 3/4 gier. Twórcy nie potrafią rozwiązać jakichkolwiek problemów z balansem. Do tego doszedł system skrzynek, który polega po prostu na tym, że gigantycznie zmniejszył średnią zdobywaną kasę za bitwę oraz zachęca do kupowania premium w postaci ""patrz, super rzadki item, kup premium to go dostaniesz!"". Bitwa za bitwą a zbudować to, co przedtem mogliśmy po ~30 bitwach teraz musimy zagrać ich ~200. Chyba, że ma się farta i się wydropi legendarny przedmiot. Ewentualnie gra pokaże go w slocie premium i będzie chciała zachęcić do jego kupna. Recykling bezużytecznych itemów na kasę w grze daje idiotycznie małe wartosci, prawie nic, gracze domagali się podniesienia wartości recyklingu, po wielu miesiącach, twórcy w końcu zrobili to, ale tylko, kiedy ma się premium(!), powodując, że teraz premium nie tylko dwukrotnie zwiększa ilośc itemów ze skrzynek, to teraz trzykrotnie zwiększa wartość recyklingu każdego itema. p2w tego nie można do końca nazwać, ale definitywnie jest to PayWall. Aktualne premium powoduje, że otrzymamy tyle, ile przed updatem zanim zmniejszyli nagrody za bitwy. Grając za darmo otrzymujemy 6x mniej. Powodzenia zbudować bota z ulubionym wyposażeniem. Gra bez premium to katorga, W dodatku gra jest wieczną alfą, co służy tylko temu, by twórcy mogli sobie dowoli zmieniać so chcą, np. jeszcze bardziej zwiększając rolę mikropłatności w grze. W rzeczywistości gra jest w gorszym stanie niż 2,5 lat temu. Kilka miesięcy temu było baardzo źle i weterani uciekali od tego szajsu. Teraz jest jeszcze gorzej.

Podsumowując: Stuprocentowy negatyw.

@edit 24.05.2019 r.
Sporo się zmieniło, nie ma już lootboxów, powrócili (nieudolnie) do tierów oraz drzewka technologii. Gra jest nadal masakryczna. Fizyka skopana, najlepsze roboty to pojedyncza broń T5 na lekkim i szybkim(najlepiej latającym) bocie. ""Connecting To Server"" wszędzie, a w dodatku by zniwelować ubytek graczy nie można już wybrać trybu gry z rotacją co godzinę. Tak. Ta sama mapa, ten sam tryb, te same ustawienia PRZEZ GODZINĘ. Dodali ulepszanie broni(by zadawały jeszcze więcej DMG!), więc TTK jeszcze bardziej zmniejszyli(za czasów Overclockingu ludzie nienawidzili buffowania DMG, widać twórcy nic się nie nauczyli). Robopassy dające jakieś kiepskie kosmetyczne przedmioty by trochę kasy wyciągnąć z umierającej gry.
Od Grudnia 2018 r. stracili połowę istniejących graczy. Jak to zrobili? Pośrednio twórcy w końcu zobaczyli, że Robocraft z początków był lepszy, więc próbują wprowadzać rzeczy i mechanikę, która była w tamtym czasie. Problem jest taki, że po pierwsze robią to nieumiejętnie, po drugie, że nadal próbują swoje ""nowości"". Na końcu otrzymujemy dziadostwo, w które nie da się grać. W tą grę gra mniej ludzi niż w Spore. I pomyśleć, że Robocraft ze swoją unikalną receptą na grę posiadał ponad 7 tysięcy aktywnych graczy.

Jakiś czas temu wyszli z Early Access, a przynajmniej zrobili to teoretycznie, bo gra nadal się zmieniała drastycznie. W sumie gra jest w gorszym stanie niż w czasie wczesnego EA.

@Edit, 14.07.2019.
No i stało się. Robocraft upadł. Freejam zwalnia ludzi bo mają mało kasy, przyznali się, że Robocraft po opłaceniu serwerów wychodzi na minus. Wszystkie zasoby idą na RobocraftX(tworzenie gry od początku). Będą utrzymywać serwery tak długo jak to będzie możliwe i naprawiać większe bugi. Kilka lat ludzie pisali co jest źle z grą, mówili jakie błędy popełniają twórcy, wszystko dostali na tacy, twórcy mieli to gdzieś i dalej rozwalali grę po swoją tajemniczą ""wizję"", która się zmieniała co update dalej rozwalając grę dziwnymi rozwiązaniami, o które nikt nie prosił. To się nie mogło inaczej skończyć Radzę nie wydawać nawet grosza na tą grę, bo pieniądze mogą przepaść. | Encontre este juego hace unos años atras. Encontre un potencial exito indie multiplayer, como por ejemplo lo que hoydia es Rocket League.
Me enamore de sus mecanicas, y del desarrollo que Freejam de entregaba a su juego, sin duda yo me alegre bastante cuando Robocraft gano el Indie del Año por parte de IndieDB.

Era esos dias en donde era una Arena 10vs10, donde llegar a Tier 10 te hacia en uno de los mejores del juego. En donde tenias que ser consistente para ir desbloqueando todas las mejoras del arbol de tecnologias. En donde la sinergia del jugador y su maquina, y lo mas importante y lo que actualmente se perdio: completo trabajo en equipo. Y quien llevaba a nivel 100 era considerado un Dios.

Donde la habilidad era para saber construir el mejor vehiculo, en todos los ambitos posibles. En donde se copiaban diseños pero aun asi quedaban con un toque personal.

Esos dias. Antes de las torres. Antes de los Megabots. Antes de los medicos.
Cuando solo habian 3 clases. Y aun asi digo que la inclusion de los medicos dio un giro muy positivo al juego.

Donde TODOS. Iban en una fila por una de las 2 lineas principales del mapa. Y en donde se producia un 50/50 en donde podia quedar la absoluta mie*da en una batalla de 10vs10 frente a frente. Y en donde el equipo contrario llegaria a su base y el equipo de dividia para ir a defender la base.

Updates pasaban y no habia tanto cambio. Incluso la inclusion de las torres era una idea fantastica, y todo el mundo en los foros dio su apoyo. Pero simplemente y en mera opinion mia, no fue ejecutada de manera efectiva, o sonaba mejor en papel. Aun asi el juego era bastante bueno en esos momentos y todavia se apreciaba ese espiritu competitivo. Lo que realmente afecto al juego fue el sistema de respawn. Antes la gente hacia cosas imposibles para sobrevivir. O intentar capturar la base enemiga. Con el respawn vi morir frente a mi todo eso.

Hasta que 2 mecanicas nuevas mataron mi idea original del juego.
Las cajas y el nuevo sistema de ""dinero"".

Incluso yo estaba a favor de perder dinero por reparar el vehiculo cada vez que perdias. Y ahora hasta puedes comprar vehiculos prefabricados.
Seguramente si el juego hubiera ido por buen camino, ahora mismo estaría jugando competitivamente en un clan.

Pero lamentablemente soñar no cuesta nada. Intentar arreglar la dignidad de este juego, mucho.

EDIT:

Me han llegado comentarios que estoy tirando mie*da al juego solamente porque soy (""fui"") ""manco"". Los estoy borrando porque la verdad no demuestran nada objetivo.

Esas screenshots son para los ignorantes. Yo no andaba suelto con este juego, por eso que me apena que haya caido tan bajo.

Si le puse mucha dedicacion para ser mejor en el juego, entrenando y mejorando. Para despues darme cuenta que el juego iba a caer como lo hizo ahora, cualquier persona no estaría contenta por ello. Y me incluyo como todos los demas. | [h1]Ruined by Developer Decisions and Carelessness[/h1]

This was one of my favorite games back in 2014. It had everything you could ask for: balancing, a good community, active and attentive devs, weapons that complemented each other, fun gameplay, good progression, lack of ""pay2win"" and so forth. Needless to say, it was awesome.

Then the January 2015 update was released.

The January 2015 update added a new gamemode where you destroy towers, levelled up, and respawn if destroyed. Initially, me and the rest of the community thought ""Cool."" and waited to see what else was in store. Little did I know that the downfall of Robocraft had begun.

(Order not completely accurate)

""Megabots"" (gigantic robots basically) were removed as soon as the update came out, if not before.

Crates were introduced (partially replacing the robits system), level based CPU limits eliminated, and the tech tree removed, eliminating progression, reducing creativity, and generally made the game much worse. Despite the huge outcry and the veterans and other players who started to leave the game, the devs simply ignored the community and moved on.

Helicopter blades were added, enabling people to make flying fortresses (maybe literrally). Personally I don't think much of this.

Then weapons, most notably an anti-air cannon and a minigun, were added, making weapons unbalanced and the game more frustrating to play. As a pilot in Robocraft (a more ""traditional"" one who used plasma bombers), this particulary saddened and angered me.

A robot shop was added, further reducing creativity.

An intro was added into the game, giving the game a more ""cheezy"" feel and making it seem as if the developers were copying other games. By this point, I personally felt that the developers were catering more toward children (12 year olds) and no longer valued older players and veterans.

All this time, veterans and other older players were leaving the game as it became increasingly apparent that the developers were not listening to the community. 

A new chat system was added, featuring a clan system that the community had been asking for for a long time. This was not nearly enough however, as the other changes above (as well as others) and the careless developers made the game unenjoyable for me (and potentially other older players, although I can not speak for them on this matter).

I finally left Robocraft for good in mid 2015 (shortly after the new chat system was introduced) after a brief stint operating a hovercraft with SMGs.

In it's current state, Robocraft is unbalanced and unenjoyable. The developers are careless and possibly largely inactive (aside from bugfixes and tweaks). Gameplay is frustrating, gamemodes horrible. 

As another reviewer (spynathan) has said: ""From Robocraft to Robocrap.""

If, somehow, all (and I mean all) changes to the game were reverted back to sometime before the January 2015 update, say, November 2014, me and other members of the community (read their reviews to see what they have to say) who have left Robocraft may very well return.

Until then, goodbye Robocraft. | 看我的游戏时间就知道了。这确实是一个好游戏，我还买了永久会员，但他现在确实让我失望了。我也是从T级时代走过来的人，RC的变化我也历历在目。不过现在，FJ的小霸王服务器，将游戏改的一塌糊涂，各种毒瘤载具对新手的压制，虽然出了简体中文，玩家也更多了，但为什么RC的评价在从好评如潮下滑到褒贬不一呢？我们应该思考，FJ更应该思考。"

[h2]📝 Sum-Up[/h2]
[i]Star Trek Online offers an authentic Trek experience wrapped in an aging MMO framework. While the core space combat and story content shine, aggressive monetization and technical issues hold it back. Best approached as a casual single-player Trek game with optional multiplayer elements, rather than a full-fledged MMO investment.[/i]

[h2]📖 In-Depth Analysis[/h2]

[h3]🌍 Core Gameplay[/h3]
The game splits between space and ground combat, with space being the clear highlight. Ship-to-ship battles capture the tactical feel of Trek combat, allowing for meaningful build customization and strategy. Ground combat, unfortunately, feels like an afterthought with dated mechanics and poor AI. The story missions effectively blend both elements but clearly favor space encounters.

[h3]👥 Monetization & Progression[/h3]
Here's where things get complicated. While technically playable for free, the game aggressively pushes premium purchases. Top-tier ships often cost $30+ each, with some rare variants reaching hundreds of dollars on the player market. Free players can eventually earn premium currency through grinding, but the time investment is substantial. Inventory space, character slots, and quality-of-life features are also paywalled.

[h3]⚔️ Content & Longevity[/h3]
The story content is extensive and well-written, featuring authentic Trek storylines and voice acting from series actors. Regular updates add new episodes and seasonal events. However, endgame content largely revolves around repeating Task Force Operations and grinding reputation systems. The PvP scene is minimal, with most players focusing on PvE content.

[h3]🔩 Technical Performance[/h3]
Running on an aging engine, STO shows its technical limitations. Server performance is inconsistent, with frequent lag and rubber-banding issues. The UI feels dated and can be overwhelming for new players. While the game runs on modest hardware, it doesn't perform as smoothly as its age would suggest.

[h3]🎵 Atmosphere & Authenticity[/h3]
When it comes to capturing the Star Trek universe, STO excels. From accurate ship models to familiar locations and sound effects, the game nails the franchise's atmosphere. The writing respects Trek lore while adding its own contributions to the universe. Character customization is extensive, allowing players to create their perfect Starfleet officer.

[h2]⭐ Final Verdict[/h2]
Star Trek Online is best viewed as a free Star Trek game with MMO elements rather than a traditional MMO. For Trek fans, the authentic universe representation and story content make it worth trying. However, players should approach with caution regarding monetization - the game constantly tempts you to spend, with some premium ships costing more than several AAA games combined.

The ideal way to play is treating it as a casual single-player game, enjoying the story content and occasional events without getting caught up in the endgame grind or ship collection aspects. The free content provides hundreds of hours of entertainment, but trying to ""catch up"" or compete at endgame will either require significant financial investment or grinding that would make the Ferengi proud.

Recommended for: Star Trek fans willing to overlook technical issues and aggressive monetization
Not Recommended for: Players seeking a modern MMO experience or those sensitive to microtransaction pressure | I have played this on and off for over a decade. I enjoy getting some Star Trek content, looking at the cool ships and managing my crew. | When this game was released it was good. Now it's too woke to enjoy. | great game to kill time | bien"

The controls are tight and satisfying, the gun and character variety is amazing and the gun theming might appear at first glance to be lame and reddit, but the fact that it's so all-encompassing and used at every opportunity makes it work even if it shouldn't. Absolute recommend. | [h3]Fun, addictive and challenging[/h3]

Easy to learn, but hard to master. 
Watching a trailer for 30 seconds tells you pretty much everything you need to know about the game. What you see is what you get. Controls are straight forward and easy to learn, enemies are varied and their mechanics can be grasped quickly after engaging them once or twice. 
This is a perfect game for the Steam Deck or people looking for a quick gaming session in-between IRL obligations. 

I have some minor annoyances with items and guns not always being clearly explained. 
Also, having to start from the beginning after each death can be demoralising.

 | It goes without saying that, where the vast library of indies is concerned, Enter The Gungeon is easily a contender for one of the best out there on the Steam store in terms of what it sets out to accomplish as a deep and challenging roguelite with a unique flavor of 'bullet hell' to stand out from the crowd that has very much saturated the market and demand for these types of games.

Though any game that is simply 'good' at what it does would be wholly underselling the sheer creativity and attention to detail put into crafting this game's world, it's many colourful characters and, above all else, the insane amount of guns and gun-like items on offer for the player to have fun with! Seeing as each run will start you off with just your starting pistol as well as any other small perks that each of the four playable 'gungeoneers' (plus several other secret characters that can be unlocked through specific means) have, which helps to encourage those to experiment with which ones align with their own playstyle.

However, to get right into what Enter The Gungeon is all about, you are tasked with exploring five increasingly challenging chambers (with a special 'sixth chamber' for those who want to truly push themselves and go beyond the 'vanilla' experience) as you go through about roughly twenty or so rooms in each chamber, with every room either being filled with random enemies that are hellbent on bringing you down, a store vendor that lets you make use of this game's currency in the form of 'shells' or a treasure chest that varies in size and elegance depending on it's quality that requires a key to unlock alongside the typical 'boss room' where the chamber's big bad lays in wait for you to take on.

Bearing in mind, this isn't even touching upon the many other little special rooms that one may encounter along the way that aren't a part of the standard chamber layout, whether this be one of a dozen or so shrines that the player can pray for various benefits (usually with a 'caveat' in the form of a loss of a heart/gun or some challenge to overcome first) or different minigames that the player can choose to participate in via payment of shells for potential awards, sometimes being absolute trash if they play terribly or being a genuinely super powerful item or gun if they perfect it!

One thing to address in particular that some may have a serious gripe with is how Enter The Gungeon starts off especially harsh to new players, not just in the sense that it's a challenging roguelite where you need to learn the many enemies and how to adapt to each of their patterns (especially when combined with other foes with complex attack patterns!) but also adapting to runs where you have great items but stuck with the starting pistol or a superb gun but having no luck with any decent items.

This problem is especially apparent when you first begin the game as most of what is unlocked at the start is not that great compared to 85-90% of the items you'll be unlocking later when you have enough 'Hegemony Credits' earned by killing bosses to spend on items that can be bought outside at the Breach to have them potentially spawn in the chambers below. Noting that the Breach itself will be quite sparse at first until you start picking up Cell Keys from bosses (or, on the rare chance, a powerful enemy) to unlock specific cells in the chambers during certain runs where you can free these NPCs for use either on the Breach to buy more items and unlock certain challenge modes or those who remain below in the chambers who offer their own items, albeit often with a twist of the sorts!

Seeing as there is a lot on offer as far as traditional roguelites go, Enter The Gungeon will prove to be a fun game for those who can stick at it, even if it is one that seems overwhelming to start off with. Since I will admit to having tried this fun indie back in 2021 on the PlayStation 4, having to give a good 12-13 shots JUST to reach the Fifth chamber and another several more before eventually getting my first 'run' completed. (Sadly I didn't get too much further in, no 'Sixth Chamber' unlocked nor did I try out most of the challenge modes) Meanwhile it only took me three runs to get to the Fifth chamber and cleared my first full run the very next attempt when making my return to the Gungeon here on PC!

This is to say that, once you've learnt how to play Enter The Gungeon, it comes back to you quite easily and, with some patience and willingness to learn, anyone can become decent at this roguelite once they know what to expect as this bullet hell roguelite doesn't give you any power-ups or little perks to help you start off better at the very beginning of each run. Rather, by playing each run and unlocking more unique and potent weapons/items, you not only become better by learning to dodge bullets better and become more adapt to the many firearms and abilities that items offer out there but improve by the selection of said guns and items becoming better the more you unlock as you progress further down the Gungeon.

Though it won't be for everyone, there is something quite satisfying about completing a run of the Gungeon, whether it be by just barely getting by and pulling through to the end in a struggle to defeat the big boss at the end of the Fifth chamber or a purely glorious playthrough where you get all manners of great items that synergize together (another fun mechanic where certain weapons/items become stronger when in your inventory together) and you nail each boss perfectly as a result, ending up with having a solid shot at the true 'end-game' via some of the secret bosses in their own areas inbetween the chambers or the dreaded Sixth Chamber itself if you have that already unlocked!

Honestly, given the sheer coverage of this game, it wouldn't surprise me if my review does not change many minds of those who have either played it for themselves or have already heard of this impressive indie by Dodge Roll. (Indeed, naming their studio after a most critical gameplay mechanic in their big hit game is quite something, albeit the success is well-deserved on their part!) But for what it's worth, Enter The Gungeon still holds up surprisingly well here in 2025 and, despite it being nearly six whole years since the final update, I can confidently say that this is one indie that any respectable Steam gamer that cherishes their indies should at least have a look at to see if they have what it takes to beat the Gungeon and, more importantly, to kill their past!

TLDR Version:

• A fascinating roguelite that fully makes use of various 'bullet hell' mechanics in it's challenging gameplay (+)
• Lovingly crafted world where anything and everything has some relation to guns, ammo or explosive set in our real life or the fiction of many other games' universes (+)
• Five chambers consisting of increasingly difficult randomly-generated rooms, with a Sixth chamber and multiple secret areas to unlock for those eager for the extra challenge (+)
• Over five hundred different guns and items, each one unique and offering something new to the player for each run through the Gungeon (+)
• Multiple different game modes that can be unlocked on top of special rooms in the Gungeon that offer optional events or minigames for players to take on and potentially be rewarded well for skilled effort (+)

• The 'bullet hell' roguelite can be overwhelming for those not used to either genre and may prove too much for some casual gamers (-)
• Starting off Enter The Gungeon can be quite slow and possibly frustrating, given the poor selection of mostly subpar or gimmicky weapons/items at the start where nothing else is unlocked (-)
• No perks or stats to improve for a better start to each run in future attempts, which will likely put off those wanting an extra aid as they progress (-) | 잠이 오지 않는 새벽에 눈을 감고 있으면, 문득 지난날에 저지른 실수들이 뜬금없이 떠오를 때가 있습니다. 그럴 때마다 이불을 뻥뻥 차는 게 일쑤지만, 지금 생각해도 창피하고 당혹한 기억들이었습니다. 만약, 다시 과거로 되돌아간다면 더 좋은 결정을 했을까? 생각들이 많아져 잠을 못 이루는 밤이 됩니다. 그렇게 밤을 지새우니 항상 수면이 부족한가봅니다.

정말로 과거를 바꿀 수 있다면 어떻겠습니까? 엔터 더 건전은 과거에 얽매이는 자들을 위한 게임이라고 할 수 있습니다. 지금은 흔하디흔한 로그라이크류를 대중적인 장르로 이끌어 준 대표작들 중의 하나죠. 

이 게임은 독특한 디자인과 캐주얼한 분위기, 그리고 강한 중독성으로 유명합니다. 저도 가벼운 마음으로 이 게임을 시작했다가, 한 밤이 되어서야 정신을 차렸습니다. 그만큼 이 게임에는 묘한 이끌림이 있는 게임인 것 같습니다. 귀염뽀짝한 디자인과 전혀 그렇지 못한 슈팅 난이도에 저는 멋대로 취해 버리고 말았습니다. 

게임의 줄거리는 대략 이렇습니다. 오래전부터 총탄 동굴에는 '과거를 바꾸는 총'이 있다는 전설이 존재합니다. 전설에 이끌린 모험가들은 각자 자신의 과오를 지우기 위해, 영원히 반복 되는 총탄 동굴로 찾아 들어간다는 내용입니다. 총굴에는 건데드라는 몬스터들이 득실거리고, 신기방기한 보물들이 가득하죠. 너무 많은 나머지, 전부 해금을 해야 해서 탈이지만 말입니다. 그래도 하나씩 해금이 되면서 아이템을 사용하는 재미가 일품인 것 같습니다.
 
아이템들을 해금하고, 도전하고, 실패하고, 또다시 도전하고... 이 게임은 대가리가 깨지면 깨질 수록 강해지는 구조인 로그라이크류라서, 실력이 점점 늘어나게 되어 있습니다. 개인마다 실력 차가 있어 플레이타임은 다를 수 있으나, 대개 이 게임을 깨기 위해서는 좋은 총과 아이템이 있어야 하는 법입니다. 그렇습니다. 이 역시, 다른 로그라이크류 게임들 맹키로 운빨똥망겜이라 할 수 있습니다. 괜찮은 아이템이 하나라도 뜨는 순간 게임의 난이도가 급락하는 건 어쩔 수가 없는가봅니다.

그래도 캐쥬얼하게 플레이하는 저로써는 완전 환영하는 편입니다. 역시, 인생은 운빨아니겠습니까? 똥손을 가진 저라도 국가권력급 무기를 얻는다면 어찌저찌 최종 보스를 잡고, 드디어 염원하던 '과거를 바꾸는 총'을 얻을 수 있습니다. 

과거를 바꾸는 총을 사용하면, 캐릭터가 과오를 저질렀던 과거로 돌아가 미래를 바꿀 수 있는 기회를 받게 됩니다. 이 게임에는 캐릭터마다 엔딩이 다양하게 준비되어 있으니, 캐릭터마다 엔딩을 보는 것도 나쁘지 않다고 생각이 듭니다. 기회가 된다면 히든 엔딩을 또한 보는 것을 추천드리겠습니다. 힘든 도전이겠지만, 게임을 온전히 깼을 때의 성취감은 이루 다 말할 수 없을 겁니다.

마지막으로 이 게임을 플레이하며 느낀바를 적고 평을 마무리하겠습니다.

요즘 유튜브를 보다, 알고리즘을 타고 보게 된 영상이 하나 있습니다. Oasis의 명곡 'Don't Look Back in Anger.' 라는 음악이었습니다. 브리티쉬 락을 즐겨 듣는 편은 아니라, 제대로 들어 보는 것은 이번이 처음이었습니다.

음악이 흥얼거리며, 함께 나오는 가사들 중에 눈에 밟히는 가사가 있었습니다. 'And so, Sally can wait.' 라는 구절이었습니다. 가사의 뜻은 아무 의미가 없음을 노엘 갤러거가 오래전에 밝힌바 있죠. 그러나 저는 Sally라는 단어 자체가 '행복'이라는 은유적인 단어로 보였습니다. '그녀'를 행복이라는 단어로 바꿔 읽으면 다음 구절들의 가사들이 이해되는 느낌이었습니다.

She knows it's too late as we're walking on by.
우리가 스쳐 지나갈 때, 그녀는 너무 늦었음을 알았지. 
Her soul slides away.
그녀가 멀어지더라도.
But don't look back in anger, I heard you say.
지난 일에 분노하지 말라는 네 말을 들었어.
At least not today.
적어도 오늘만큼은.

누구에게나 과거는 존재하는 법이고, 지난날의 과오가 있기 마련입니다. 자신이 잘못한 것이 아니더라도, 실수를 용납하지 못 하는 경우도 있겠죠. 정말로 과거에 선택을 다르게 했었더라면, 지금의 삶보다 더 나은 삶을 살고 있었을까. 아주 잠시 생각에 빠졌던 것 같습니다. 

지나간 어제는 돌아오지 않을 과거가 되었고, 오늘의 나는 어제의 미래이자, 내일의 과거입니다. 지나간 일에 후회를 두는 것은 어쩔 수 없는 저의 소심한 성격 때문이지만, 그런 선택을 했기에 지금의 내가 있는 것이라 생각합니다. 

현실에는 '과거를 바꾸는 총' 따위란 존재하지 않습니다. 하지만 그것과 맞먹는 '관용'이라는 훌륭한 것이 존재하죠. 자기 과오에게 관용을 베푼다면 어제보다 성숙한 내가 있을 거라 믿어 의심치 않습니다. 이 글을 읽은 모든 사람이 언젠간 어두컴컴한 총굴에서 벗어나, 여러분만의 '현재를 바꾸는 총'을 찾았으면 좋겠습니다. 저 또한 맘 편히 잠이 들 날이 올거라 믿겠습니다. 언젠가는 말이죠."

76561198082086866,312530,Duck Game,0.0,"Action, Indie",0,"Аркадный многопользовательский шутер, где вы управляете забавными утками, сражающимися друг с другом в динамичных и безумных баталиях. Игра отличается яркой пиксельной графикой, простыми механиками, но при этом безумным весельем и бесконечными возможностями для весёлых конфликтов. Она идеально подойдёт для друзей, желающих провести время в кооперативе или же в борьбе за звание лучшего утенка.

🎮 Геймплей:
Основной элемент игры — это битвы между игроками на разнообразных аренах с использованием различных видов оружия. Утки могут стрелять, прыгать, лазить по стенам, использовать разнообразные предметы, такие как гранаты, шлемы или даже шокеры. В игре много оружия, и каждое сражение превращается в забавную мясорубку, где важно быстро реагировать и использовать все доступные ресурсы.

💥 Механики и оружие:
Механики управления достаточно просты, но игра требует от игроков хорошей реакции и точности, чтобы победить. В арсенале — множество забавных видов оружия, от базовых пистолетов до более экзотических, таких как шурикены и лазеры. Все оружие имеет свои особенности, и использование их в нужный момент может повлиять на исход сражения.

🦆 Арены и карты:
Карты в Duck Game разнообразны, каждая имеет свои уникальные особенности. Некоторые арены требуют от игроков умения маневрировать в ограниченном пространстве, другие предлагают возможности для скрытных атак и неожиданных поворотов событий. Также в игре есть случайная генерация оружия на арене, что заставляет игроков адаптироваться к ситуациям.

🎨 Графика и стиль:
Графика выполнена в ярком и привлекательном пиксельном стиле, что создаёт забавную атмосферу игры. Всё яркое, весёлое и красочное, что идеально соответствует духу игры. Несмотря на простоту дизайна, каждая арена и модель утки продуманы, а анимации выглядят плавно и динамично.

🎧 Звук и музыка:
Звуковое оформление соответствует забавной атмосфере игры, с забавными звуковыми эффектами при выстрелах, падениях и столкновениях. Музыкальные треки также настроены на весёлый, энергичный тон, поддерживая динамику происходящего на экране.

🕹 Управление:
Управление в Duck Game достаточно простое, и даже новички могут быстро освоить основные механики. Но игра не прощает ошибок, особенно когда противники быстры и умело используют оружие. Это делает игру не только весёлой, но и вызывающей желание стать лучше, чтобы победить на арене.

💥 Многопользовательский режим:
Одной из сильных сторон игры является её многопользовательский режим. Duck Game идеально подходит для компании друзей, и каждый матч превращается в бурю смеха и веселья. Игра поддерживает как локальный, так и онлайн-мультиплеер, что расширяет возможности для игры с людьми по всему миру.

✅ Большое разнообразие оружия и карт, что поддерживает интерес.
✅ Яркая пиксельная графика и стиль, который привлекает внимание.
✅ Простое управление, которое позволяет быстро войти в игру.
✅ Отличный многопользовательский режим с возможностью играть с друзьями.

⚡ Минусы:
❌ Игра может стать однообразной на длительных сессиях, если играть без перерывов.
❌ Нет глубокой сюжетной линии, что ограничивает её в одиночном прохождении.
❌ Некоторые карты могут быть слишком хаотичными, что затрудняет достижение победы для новичков.

🏆 Оценка: 6/10

 | Great mulriplayer party game. local multiplayer makes it great for an evening of friendly (or not so) carnage bringing out the competitive in everyone! | **Title:** ""Duck Game: Quack, Shoot, Die, Repeat – The Best Multiplayer Combat Game You Didn’t Know You Needed""  

**Review:**  
*Duck Game* is the multiplayer combat game you never knew you needed, and now that you’ve experienced it, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without it. Picture this: You’re a tiny, adorable duck with a shotgun, battling other ducks who are also armed to the beak, and it’s glorious. Every round is a chaotic, hilarious free-for-all where the only thing more dangerous than your enemies is your own reflexes.  

The mechanics are as simple as they are absurd. You run, you shoot, and you try not to blow yourself up while your friends laugh maniacally as they do just that. The best part? The weapons. There are so many ridiculous options—flamethrowers, grenades, rocket launchers, and even, yes, a literal swordfish. Every round feels like you’re stuck in a fast-paced, chaotic fever dream, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.  

The levels are delightfully weird, ranging from tiny, claustrophobic arenas where you’ll be trapped with no escape but a barrel of TNT, to larger arenas that can make even the most hardened players panic when they realize they’re out of ammo and a duck with a bazooka is charging at them. The game thrives on its unpredictability. You never know when you’ll be thrown into a wild situation, but you can bet that it’ll involve either a duck explosion or a surprise victory because someone managed to walk into their own mine.  

But here’s the real magic: *Duck Game* is the kind of game that makes friendships stronger—or destroys them, depending on how often you’re gunned down by your best friend. It’s the perfect blend of competitiveness and comedy, where every victory feels earned, and every defeat is hilarious enough to make you want to keep playing. It’s impossible to take seriously, and that’s exactly why it’s so addictive.  

Verdict: *Duck Game* is a chaotic, unpredictable masterpiece of multiplayer fun. It’s one of the top 3 best multiplayer combat games ever because it never stops being fun—even when you're getting shot in the face by a duck who *accidentally* grabbed the wrong weapon. 10/10 would quack my way into another round.  

**Disclaimer:** This review was written by an AI who has never wielded a shotgun as a duck, but deeply respects those who do. Complaints should be directed to the nearest duck, preferably one with a swordfish. | Ох, что касаемо игр с друзьями друг против друга - это моя любимая.

Best part of this is the football. You got football played with planes and you can't underestimate how good that is. 
5 different planes add some good depth to it.

Most common server is 14 people, and sometimes the skill level can be quite high. In which case be maybe a bit prepared for some grumpy players especially if you don't know which direction you're going, don't know how to pass, and go for enormous kill counts and neglecting the ball. 
Otherwise, enjoy one of the most underrated multiplayer games on the internet, and which is free as well. | A few years ago I had a lot of fun with this game.  Not sure if it's still alive/active or whatever and I can't exactly find out since my account is just, I don't know, gone?  It's weird.

It was really fun, though.  Like a lot of games that have an overall account level, though, it wasn't the most balanced.  Later upgrades and planes were just, you know, objectively better than starting things.  The ships aren't necessarily rock-paper-scissors in design but there are elements like that to them.  Having said that, the starting ship is probably the best one, which is good for beginners.

Regardless, the ships were balanced enough that you could play whatever and probably be fine in most situations.  The game modes were varied enough.  You had death match and team death match, yeah, but there was also a mode where you destroyed an enemy base, and another where you effectively played soccor with the space ships.  I really liked the last one, but they were all fun and I'd play whatever when I did.

Controls were fine, graphics were fine, sounds were fine.  The only problem I ever encountered were some latency issues, where people would just appear to teleport somewhere else or where you were clearly disconnecting (everyone was falling or flying into walls).

Yeah, every now and then I boot this up and try to figure out my old account, or to make my old account work, but it never happens.  Had a lot of good times and I would totally play some more, if not a lot, should I ever fix that.  Good game, if you see it on sale, do check it out.  Assuming it's still alive.  It might not be!

The edit: game is mostly dead except for old elitists, apparently.  Shame.  Guess they are a pretty closed off community and not friendly to newbs.  Oh well.  RIP altitude. | A few years back, this game was great. It had a small community but enough to make the game worth playing. As of now there's probably only a few dozen people playing.

Minor issues: I did run into some bugs, where in one battle the game got stuck in a cutscene and I had to restart my entire run.

76561198082086866,329110,Gems of War - Puzzle RPG,1.7166666666666666,"Action, Adventure, Casual, RPG, Strategy, Free To Play",3,"A very fun but very poorly balanced game. I want to cover four quick points.

[h1]Lack of balance part 1 - the reason for nearly all negative reviews here (and a workaround!)[/h1]

In Gems of War the primary gameplay is broken down into games you either play against AI created teams in a variety of scenarios, or in games you play against real teams created by other players that the AI controls. The balance for the AI created teams is a bit messed up. It starts out trivially easy but scales up incredibly rapidly and caps at around level 50. The problem is that you'll soon find yourself unable to effectively compete against the AI teams. At this point it seems lots of people decide it's either go pay-to-win or call it quits.

There's a much better solution. Go play PvP. PvP will pair you against more fairly matched teams. You'll get better rewards and be able to continue leveling up your cards and team. Since the AI team scaling stops at level 50, by the time you come back to it - it'll be a cake walk. It's counter intuitive but yeah. Start by playing against AI teams and then after that do PvP until you're ready to face the AI...


[h1]Lack of balance part 2 - the fun is strictly capped[/h1]

The cards in the game are in no way balanced or is there any major attempt to balance them. Rarer cards tend to do everything less rare cards do... and more... and better. The problem is that this strictly caps the room for creative team design. You are left to take your best/rarest cards, add a mana generator (turning gems of a certain color into the one your 'win card(s)' need), and that's pretty much going to crush any other team you could make. This is really fun at first when you're regularly finding more rarer cards and your decks are constantly shifting and changing in new and interesting ways. But as you start to collect most of the top cards - the fun starts to stop. Suddenly there's not much to look forward to, and since less rare cards tend to just be worse in every possible way there's not really any sort of room for creative team design. 

[h1]Monetization - you can, but don't need to and I wouldn't want to[/h1]

The major 'grab' in this game is chasing the carrot of rarer cards. With real money you can buy these cards - or at least keys to chests that give you a very high chance of getting them. However, everything relevant that you can buy you can earn through regular play as well. I actually find this a bit frustrating. I'd love to toss the developers a few dollars since I've gotten a lot of enjoyment out of this game, but just about everything you can buy is going to just decrease the hours of enjoyment you can have with the game. A recurring problem with free to play games that don't just focus on aesthetics purchases.

[h1]Overall - Great game.[/h1]

Overall yeah, give it a go. It's by a wide margin the most fun I've had in this sort of game and there's hundreds of hours of entertainment in this game for those that enjoy the fundamental gameplay. | I saw this game on my friend's profile and saw that he has over 200 hours logged on it.

Even the tutorial makes the game sound pay to win. 
It doesn’t bind to your steam account, you need to maintain a separate login.
Its an energy driven game. There are plenty of card games without artificial limitations like that.
It feels like there are a lot of turns you don’t actually do anything.

There are good sides to it, so I won’t say it's a bad game, I just don’t recommend it. 
Unlike many games, you only have three active monsters in play at a time and it takes time to replace them after they die.
There’s a campaign map to explore and the game has a lot of features and modes.

It has all the wonderful aspects of an addictive CCG. Opening packs, nice card art, interesting gameplay. What is it that finally killed the game for me? Arena Trolls.

Guild wars is just 45 quick matches over the course of 36hrs so there isn't enough there to keep an avid player going. So what's left? The Arena. Even if you only play the lowest level which is called ""Limited"". Even if you have mastered tactics and gameplay. You WILL lose more than you win. Why? Because the Arena is rampant with players who have put together the perfect decks. Either by grinding in game currency to buy singles OR they spent real money on the game. Good for them... I'm happy for them, I really am. At the same time, I'm tired of players who are no better than I am, winning everytime because they are bringing unbeatable decks to the Arena. I have 30K wins overall in the game (mostly in Guild Wars) so I know how to play. These players are still unbeatable because of the decks they bring to the lowest of 3 levels of Arena.

TL;DR: Everything above Bronze in loadouts is cosmetic. Characters rotate to play for free every week.

How this game works is entirely different, you get loadout cards, now while you might think, ""Oh, well that must mean that everything Silver and Gold is better than things that are Bronze."" This is not correct, every card above Bronze simply works as a form of cosmetic.
On the other hand you have people that would say, ""Getting a Bronze card would mean you have way too many advantages over players that don't."" This is also not true, as the bronze cards simply give you perks on the side that give you small boosts, no gun damage, health (Except for one perk that gives you up to 30 health for dying multiple times) or other character attributes altered with cards.

Now with these loadout cards, you also get different weapons. These weapons on the loadout cards will change how you play your character. By default you have good loadouts, you can destroy anybody with the basic loadouts so long as you can aim, your guns make you, not your perks. You can get a different gun for every rarity of loadout, even the worst rarities come with guns that can change how you play by alot, but for the most part all the guns are reletively balanced.

Next comes the whole RNG thing that people get very angry at because they can't find good things in cases. 1000 ingame credits = 1 case, this case grants you 1 random loadout card in the game, with the higher tier rarities being lower chances of obtaining, but still possible. if you really want to go all out, you can spend 5 dollars in real world money for some random cases that are primarily used for the higher chance at getting Gold and Cobalt loadouts, but still guarenteed a Silver loadout.

The crafting system is next and it's pretty simple, put in cards you don't like of the same rarity and get the next loadout rarity up, you also select any of the characters that you want a loadout specifically for. Essentially trade up contracts in CS:GO. Pretty easy to understand, gives you another chance at randomizing and it's a way of letting you get loadouts that are Silver and higher without the RNG chance, however the weapons and perks are randomized each time. 
With that being said, if you find that you can't be bothered to open up cases for 1000 ingame credits, you can simply save up enough to just buy a bronze loadout that you like.

Next comes characters. Here's where people have whined most about the game. ""6-10 Dollars for a single character in this game? What a ripoff!"" And here's where I come in and say ""You don't need to spend money, blah blah blah, you can play the game normally and get every character you just need to save up a bit.""
On top of this, there is a free character rotation every week. Just like in League of Legends, every week three characters become unlocked for the week's duration as playable characters, afterwards you need to purchase them to keep them permanently.

To end this I'm simply going to put it. The game is fun, not Pay 2 Win, and it's starting to take up time I would spend playing Tf2. | Most fun I've had with an FPS in a long time. Pretty fast-paced combat, classes aren't too gimmicky. Anyone who digs Enemy Territory or thought Brink had a ton of potential should definitely check it out | I find DB has drifted from what I would want in a game to something I don't like. More importantly, I don't think it will improve enough to enjoy going forward, so I'm going to uninstall DB.

The fundamental reason I'm going to uninstall is that the initial and early characters didn't feel too gimmicky, and they tended to work together. Since that time, they've become more and more ridiculous. Constantly putting in characters that don't really mesh together isn't helping the team aspect of the game. When you can help your team while still shooting the enemy and not need to make a decision about which to do, you have a problem. Throwing health packs, ammo, and needing to be on top of people to revive them encourages smart team play. ""Don't run into the open, we can't pick you up"" Sparks the medic comes out, and more fools over-extend because you can revive them now at a distance, instead of them being dead and gibbed, and they can be picked up. Not being revived is the game punishing bad play by those who over-extend. Javelin dispenses ammo even in fire-fights, so who needs to manage and plan for their ammo? Getting into long fire-fights back in 2015 used to require someone to be very good at managing ammo and position. You had to bring a support character, but that person needed excellent positioning to be able to toss that pack and hit a teammate who needs it without giving it to the enemy, and then quickly be back in the fight. The same is true of the medics. Running a combo of medic/ammo giver required great support. Automatically dispensing ammo in a circle around you doesn't force you to think about how to help your team, and you can help without actively helping. You can both help you team with a power, and shoot an enemy. This isn't encouraging teammates to help each other, it just encourages them to bunch up. Further, key abilities can be done by everyone, like repairing, planting explosives, and reviving. This dilutes the need to take certain classes at all.

Further, rarely has a new character been balanced on release, which means in the the intervening time between release and patch you face a lot of people playing a broken character. In-fact, new characters were never allowed straight into ranked. They would hold them back because they knew they weren't balanced. They eventually gets nerfed, frequently too far, and the cycle repeats. This is irritating, but I also know that characters aren't balanced until you really get a lot of people playing them. I don't know why they feel so far off each time, but I suspect it is because of the aforementioned decision to keep pushing out characters that have odd abilities that need to be special to justify making a new merc. Balancing among more and more abilities also takes more and more effort - effort that could be spent making the one thing that doesn't get enough attention - maps.

Maps. You need more maps. You always need more maps. More maps means more unique strategies, it means you can play a lot of matches without repeating maps (back when there were only 6 maps, I took lots of several week or several month breaks because I didn't want to play the same maps over and over). Each map should highlight a few abilities. You can get the objective done without them and successfully defend without them, but on some maps, some characters should shine without being overpowered. Each map should be able to take advantage of each merc's abilities. I know this is a tall order, but you want to be great, right? The more abilities you have, the more trouble you have where you get into a map and think, ""I brought a terrible merc for this map."" That should not happen, ever. Rhino is a good example. There are some maps where I will never take him, he's far too slow, and he needs to be on top of people to do damage. There are too many maps where he cannot do much, and very few maps where he can truly shine. Similarly, taking Skyhammer or Arty in Underground, is a waste of time (Skyhammer's marker does act like a grenade, but it isn't a great one). Stoker, on the other hand, dominates in Undergound because his ability is always useful. There is no need for that enormous discrepancy between characters. This removes flexibility to form and break defenses. 

While this is definitely a personal preference, the worst part about this game is being one-shot. I don't know why people think this is fun in an arcade-style shooter. In ARMA, SWAT, Rainbow 6, being one-shot killed is fine and I like those games, but not in a game like this. It wasn't fun 20 years ago with the rocket launchers in Quake and Unreal, it still isn't now. The wide-spread availabilty and ease-of-use of one-shot weapons in this game is killing my enjoyment (and I realize that this is a very personal complaint, hence the reason I listed it last). The fact that most people cannot use one-shot weapons well in a fast-moving arcade-style shooter doesn't make them balanced. In any game, when you balance to the average, you neglect that part of the population who will take the time needed to perfect the one-shot (or power, skill, etc.) who will still continue to dominate with over-powered weapons/abiliites, etc. This is where the accurate arcade-style shooting and movement work against you - perfecting that one-shot is 100% doable. I've met and seen plenty of people who have perfected it. For awhile, I could do it pretty well, but it felt really cheap and dirty, so I stopped. Once you master the one-shot kill, it's a joke for those who don't. Removing scope sway on snipers - terrible move, the sway at least made the one-shot kills reasonably rare but threatening. The reviver railgun of doom - terrible move. I still stuck around, despite really not liking these changes. The additional of Javelin was another change that I didn't like. What purpose does she serve? There are characters who can break-up camps, if they're not doing the job, adjust them! Instead, you put in the one-shot rocket of doom, something I was really proud of you for not putting in the game from day one. An arcade style game balanced without a rocket launcher. Ponder that. We had that.

Coming back after a long break, I wanted to see how the game progressed. I see the new characters introduced, and one of them is Hunter - he has a crossbow that can one-shot people. After playing a few games against people with Hunter, I can see once again that the higher-skilled players are STILL taking the high-damage sniper rifles, and Hunter. I used to accept being one-shot as part of the game, but I just don't want to deal with it anymore. If I want to be killed in one shot while moving around a corner, I'll play the SWAT and Rainbow 6 games - realistic shooters. Not in arcade shooters. I want teamwork, but that can't be had, because not enough abilities force you to support or rely your team. I used to think that the self-healing that all mercs have was fine, but as time went on, I found myself drawn to characters that had ""tough"" perk because I didn't need a medic. Ammo is easy to come by, generally, and rarely do you need to go far out of the way to get it, so who needs those pesky teammates? Going to get ammo shouldn't be easy, a team game should prefer you to get it from teammates, and hence punish you by having inconvenient ammo supply locations.

In case you are wondering, I don't play Overwatch. I saw enough in the videos to know that it wasn't what I was looking for. And now, very sadly, I must conclude that Dirty Bomb joins it.

Finally, I apologize for mistakes - I edited this heavily to make sure my thoughts were coordinated, but I suspect there are errors still left. | Back in 2003, Splash Damage released a standalone freeware game known as Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.  It combined the speed and movement of Quake and the hitscan and aiming mechanics of Counter-Strike into a objective-based game.  The focus on team-oriented objectives created a very popular fps game that sadly had a community die off and move on.

Splash Damage attempted to revive the series with with Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, but was largely unsucessful.

Welcome to Dirty Bomb, the newest reincarnation of the gameplay.  It feels and plays like the first legitemate sucessor to Enemy Territory.  With similar team-based classes, and a much more noob-friendly interface than ET could ever muster, this game could possibly be the first game that is a legitemate competitor to CSGO in terms of competitive FPS games... as long as Nexon doesn't FUCK everything up and make the game p2w.

The shooting mechanics combine that of quake and counter-strike.  Players are tanky and can take 2 or 3 headshots to kill.  However, similar to CS, aiming for the head is highly rewarding as most guns will kill in 8 to 10 shots (generally it takes a little less than 2 seconds to kill a player with body shots).  Additionally, you're highly accurate while moving, which makes strafe shooting a viable and effective strategy.

Don't let the cartoonish atmosphere fool you, however.  Despite its simplistic nature, there is a lot of depth to the game in taking fights, healing with medics, and even intentionally suiciding to respawn with full ammo or to defend an objective.

If you like playing competitive FPS games, give this one a fair shot.  The gameplay is quite unforgiving for new players, but highly rewarding if you stick with it. | By far my favorite FPS game on PC and one of the best i've played ever, with the added plus that it is FREEE! While it is not pay to win, it definitly requires skill and somewhat good reaction speed. It is incredibly fast paced, with battles happening across the various maps. It has a selection of 20 different mercs, with an array of abilities that include but not limited to land mines, airstrikes,and revive guns. It's devs pay close attention to their fan base and always try to respond, while keeping them up to date with every new piece added to the game. All in all, the best PC game I have played yet and it receives the highest recommendations I can give. A game worth playing :D

edit:they have added even more characters and weapons,
and I want my nomination task finished. Play Dirty!

       Transformice...what can I say about it... Well, you are a mouse. Which isn't that great, but the real amazing thing is that you chase after cheese all day.  Literally my biggest dream that I never told anyone. Some may make fun of me for the amount of time I played, but I say if I could chase after cheese in real life I would spend more than a few couple hundred hours on it. You know what makes it even better? It's free! Free Cheese! And you know everything free tastes better. It's hard for new people to like it because it's pretty difficult to be able to even get the cheese in the first place, but once you get that cheese, everything changes. You just want to get that cheese again and again. Life is going good; all the cheese you can get your little grubby little paws on. Then BOOM, it hits you, you realize it, you finally realize that the cheese you love is full of MSG and you can't stop even if you wanted to... It all spirals out of control at this point. Am I a mouse or human??? I don't even know anymore. I need to go get some more cheese. Yes, cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE!!!

76561198082086866,266510,Hand of Fate,2.1333333333333333,"Action, Indie, RPG",4,"As with HoF2, Hand of Fate delivers an unprecedented and unique mix between deckbuilder, dungeon crawler, and action RPG. Also as with HoF2, there are glaring flaws in the implementation of mechanics, this time particularly with the Chance Card game and the action RPG combat itself.  
My issue with the Chance Cards is that it is the only minigame you have available to you. HoF2 rectifies this by introducing several others that aren't almost entirely RNG or perception-based: some moreso, some less so, but it all balances out. You also have a greater variety of equipment for dealing with or ""gaming"" certain minigame types. Hand of Fate has maybe two pieces of equipment that will help contribute to your success at Chance Cards.  
The action RPG combat is by far the WORST part of the game. While it's fluid and more dynamic (more options) in HoF2, HoF's combat is plagued by HORRIBLE camera movement and maneuverability of character. Too many times have I gotten stuck on a piece of terrain, surrounded by multiple enemies, and stunlocked by unavoidable attacks. On top of that, enemy HP feels much tankier than HoF2, which draws out combat encounters long enough that I began to feel the game was no longer respecting my time.  
Altogether, at this point in the game's life, I would have to say skip this one and try out HoF2 instead. While that entry has its own share of problematic features, they are not insurmountable, and the breadth of equipment and card types available allow you to take a more tailored approach towards the game's various encounters and challenges.  
Edit: Another thing I wanted to touch on is how some of the token chains for encounter cards feel REALLY unbalanced, requiring you to either repeatedly draw and complete the card's challenge with increasing requirements AND harder Chance Cards, or complete at least three Chance Card challenges with success or Huge Success. This is frustrating and a huge turn-off, but what I've come to understand is Defiant Development LOVES implementing things like this, as they were complained about also by users when HoF2 was fresh, and some things had to be nerfed.

The ""No custom servers"" option just does not work. For example like 20% of the time when joining a server it starts a download for either plugins or a map. 

Creating your own server sometimes wont work, Because you are not hosting a server, you are looking for one that already exists to ""take over""  so sometimes you cant host what you want. 

And on top of those 2 things you can only filter for 1 map/difficulty/Gamemode Rather than being able to filter out everything you do/don't want. For example [only wanting to see 4 maps on Hard and Hell on earth] [and only 4 or 7 long] 

These create annoying issues where you join a normal looking server and either start to download stuff you don't want or whole parts of the game are just disabled.

killing floor 2 - это в первую очередь отличнейшая кооперативная стрелялка. Первое что приходит в голову играя в неё это L4D. Но в отличии от L4D тут нет такого сюжета, тут есть волны монстров | 游戏是好玩的，打折可以无脑入。但整个游戏就是一坨屎山一样堆到了近100个G，这么劣质的材质包占这么大地方开发商你觉得合适吗 | Killing Floor 2 is basically just an update of the original game with a fixed leveling system and a handful of other changes. 

The biggest issue with the original Killing Floor was that it had a leveling system where leveling up perks often involved doing tedious tasks instead of just playing the game. Commandos had to go out of their way to hunt stealthed enemies and farm them, Support class players had to sit around welding doors, and a medics optimal leveling was to do nothing but heal. Oftentimes this just meant farming this experience on an empty server under specific conditions as leveling through normal play took too long. In Killing Floor 2 one levels a perk using those perks weapons and abilities - just playing the game properly. The game has also been better balanced so that lower leveled players can do reasonably well on higher difficulties and that leveling itself is a significantly faster experience. Only the Hell on Earth difficulty demands a high or maxxed level perk to play through. 

Alot of the new stuff is a mixed bag. The new weapons are a good addition to the game, and the medic perk gets quite a few of them. Weapons now share perks so other classes can viably support medics as healers without impacting their role. The SWAT perk does not really scale well for the higher difficulties as it does not fill any role because of its lack of firepower and meaningful abilities and the Survivalist just outright tries not to fill any role. The new enemies and bosses make the game a lot more interesting and challenging, but some of the bosses are comically easy, while others are extremely difficult. Some new enemies like the E.D.A.R feel out of place with their abilities and aesthetic, but most of the new adds make the game more interesting while fitting in with the old cast. 

There is not much reason to play the first game over this new one. Pretty much every change is for the better and the changes that are not that good are not that big of a deal.

[b] Review [/b]
       Clicker Heroes is a great background game or a game to play when your watching tv. At first it is very easy to progress and it becomes much faster once you get a couple of Hero Souls by Ascending. There is alot more strategy than one might expect from a free game. You must decide who to upgrade, which skills to buy, which things to spend you Hero Souls on, which things to spend your Ancient Souls on, when to Ascend, when to Transcend, which heroes to Gild, what missions to send your mercenary, to revive or bury your mercenary, which clan to join, and much more! A great game to just waste some time without spending money. It's free, why not give it a try?

http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198120632907/recommended/?p=1 | Clicker Heroes is a a drug that requires increasing doses. Try it only if you have a strong willpower. Clicker Heroes is one of THOSE games. Like, THOSE games. When you look at it, it seems like a ridiculously simple idea, like a little kid invented it or something. You're like, ""Wow that looks dumb."" and move on. However, if you decide to be so open-minded as to actually play the game before judging it, suddenly your a** will be glued to your chair, you just can't stop playing. Seems familiar? Can relate? This is the exact thing that happened to me (don't worry, I still have a social life and don't have to move around with a computer chair stuck to my rear end). So anyway, if you are looking for a way to kill time if you're feeling really bored, then Clicker Heroes is the way to go for sure. 

One more thing: Prepare for your fingers to have the time of their lives. 10/10, got balls? Try it! | Clicker Heroes consist of thousands of stages filled with monsters which you have to kill by clicking on them. From stage to stage the monsters getting stronger. While killing monsters you will earn gold which can be spend to hire heroes and to upgrade them to deal more damage. This is necessary to go further.
Clicker Heroes is a free good addictive little time waster.

Эта игра которую можно ощутить. Все эти кривые морды на иконках, звуки, музыка, изображение, гремлинский язык прекрасно создают атмосферу города механизма, в котором постоянно надо бороться, преумножать доход, собирать победные очки, строить козни и делать все для победы. 
Рандом - изюминка игры. В ней ты профессионал ровно до тех пор, пока тебе выпадают хорошие результаты на кубике, никто не смотрит  твою руку. Важно помнить, что ты можешь в один момент побеждать с большим отрывов, а на следующем ходу ты в тюрьме, со сброшенными картами и отобранными пятью очками.

I'm a huge fan of so many humble published games I got this because of that and the winter sale.  Definitely worth it and despite saying not knowing if steam deck compatible, well I just played an hour on deck with no issues so, so far so good. Just a cute game that mixes 2d tower defense in a cute and entertaining way for a modest price. I'm not sure if I'd pay full price but I haven't gotten more into it, I'' try to remember to edit if/when I do but for 10 or less if you want to treat yourself, do this instead of ice cream | The game is really good. Full of variety and character. I played it with remote play with a friend.

The people who are saying the game is repetitive didn't get past the first level. I haven't seen a single level repeat itself. Each one of them have a different mechanic for defending the base. Some are on a moving platform, others have portals that teleport players and projectiles around, others have moving platforms that can be controlled with switches to move enemies and turrets around, others have different kinds of traps that you can use to your advantage, some have locked areas that only a specific character can reach and build stuff inside, some enemies move on walls instead of walking in a straight line. The game does have a very big ammount of variety.

Tip: Unless you're new to strategy games, play the game on insane. Strategy games are more fun the more you have to use your brain. Also with a friend makes it even more fun. Specially if each of you voice act a character. The story is very enjoyable when you get farther into it and things start getting deeper."

実績は５時間で４０個ぐらいいけるっぽい | 关于这个游戏，首先我给出几点建议：
1、设置一个学生或工作时间不能玩的限定，因为这个游戏的瘾性相当的大，要不是还要上学我觉得我不会关电脑的，劲爆的BGM，及其爽快的打击音效，还有简单的操作（纯粹的点击方块和说明）而且相当多的关卡，都是这个游戏成为一个关不掉的游戏，一开始类设计后面类塔防而且爆爽的打击效果也让这个游戏短时间几乎玩不腻，非常的爽！甚至你还可以安装在手机上打发时间！不过学生不要玩，学生不要玩，学生不要玩！赶紧关掉steam去学习，反正我被这玩意害得补作业补到凌晨两点！
2、建议简体（繁体也可）中文，页面看的实在蛋疼，虽然身为学生还是有能看懂的英文水平，不过着实是太不方面了，愣是刚了半天才明白这些技能干嘛的…不过想想为了阻止学生在这里沉迷这个游戏，还是不要中文了吧【滑稽】用我拙劣的英文给大家翻译一下，左边是升级五个伙伴，第一个是瞄一个打子弹？二个是瞄好几个打一枪？第三个是瞄几个打到死？第四个是打一个误伤一堆？第五个是选一个打五倍？右下角的是升级点数，虽然不是这个意思不过当这个理解吧，注意升级点数是一次用完的，如果某技能够升十级就只能一次升十级，升一定阶段会开buff，每满百可以重置buff然后buff 全没了不过基础伤害增加。右边是升子弹和开技能！以上翻译如有不对谢谢指正！留言私信都可以！
3、希望我的评测能对大家有用啦，非喜勿喷，个人看法。总之画面跟mc有的一拼但一看就懂非常明白。音乐很有劲不过有些重复，没有情节但游戏感很棒，设计很良心，玩起来相当爽，可以右上随时存档，也会自动存档。
一言以蔽之，业界良心，推荐但劝不要沉迷，一定要学会放下！！！ | One of the only two free to play games I know that doesn't have pay2win mechanics (The other one is Path of Exile, which is one of the best games I've ever played. Check it out!)

Just be prepared to get stuck in Training 3 over and over again. I have time warped 61 times now and it still takes me hours to get through Training 3 and I get totally stuck in Training 4.

That being said.. it's pretty much the best casual idling game I've ever seen. This one actually has neat graphics. The only downside is that the whole soundtrack is just one song. It's really good as an interactive screen saver while listening to your favourite EDM if you don't have anything better to do.

I don't know if there are actual Demosceners behind this game, but it kinda gives me that feeling of watching a (very repetitive :D ) demo. It's a little bit of neat fireworks on your screen with a gaming element added to it.

Oh and make sure to log in every now and then to get the cooldown on those sweet dimension shifts. They will give you huge permanent DPS boosts that add up until the next warp. My record wave (1940) was set with 12 shifts around new year's eve."

游戏里的屠杀结局，是对人性黑暗面的直白审视。在这个走向里，玩家选择对遇到的怪物赶尽杀绝，每一次攻击都伴随着怪物的痛苦与绝望。游戏画面随着杀戮推进，逐渐染上压抑的色调，音乐也变得扭曲阴森。最终，玩家会面对一个孤独且荒芜的世界，曾经生机勃勃的地下王国沦为死寂废墟，只剩无尽悔恨与空虚。这个结局以极端的方式警示玩家，暴力与冷漠只会带来毁灭，让我们反思自身行为对周围世界的影响。
 
和平路线则截然不同，它是一曲爱与理解的赞歌。玩家摒弃武器，用耐心、真诚与怪物交流，挖掘出每个角色背后温暖人心的故事。游戏氛围也从最初的紧张转为温馨，音乐轻快明亮，充满希望。在这个结局中，玩家不仅化解了怪物与人类之间的千年仇恨，还让地下世界重归安宁与和谐。它向我们展示了善良、包容的力量，让我们坚信爱能跨越一切障碍。
 
中立结局处于二者之间，充满了未知与变数。玩家的每一次抉择都可能改变故事走向，怪物的命运在玩家一念之间或喜或悲。这一结局凸显了游戏的自由与开放，强调玩家的选择具有决定性意义，每个人都能在游戏中书写属于自己的独特篇章。

 | Quando a gente pensa na vida, às vezes ela parece um pouco sem sentido, não é? A gente corre atrás de metas, objetivos e sonhos, mas no fundo, fica a pergunta: ""qual o real propósito disso tudo?"" Albert Camus, um dos maiores filósofos existencialistas, fala exatamente sobre isso. Ele diz que a vida é absurda ou seja, não tem um grande significado pré estabelecido. Mas ao invés de cairmos no desespero ou na frustração, ele propõe uma atitude de revolta e aceitação: continuar vivendo e buscando pequenas razões para seguir em frente, mesmo sabendo que nada vai dar ""a resposta definitiva"" para o sentido da vida.

É aí que >>>Stardew Valley<<< entra de uma maneira muito interessante. No jogo, a fazenda nunca vai ser 100% perfeita. Mesmo depois de mundo trabalho, sempre vai ter mais coisa para fazer.

76561198082086866,268500,XCOM® 2,0.0,Strategy,0,"amazing tactical gameplay and challenge. XCOM 2 and WOTC are so different it is like 2 different games which makes replayability even higher. One of my favorite games. I would give 10/10 | After my 3rd attempt, I was able to beat this game, and I didn't really like it. The game is cruel, unreasonably hard and very disrespectful to player. 
At first, the game bombards you with a ton of non-skippable events, missions, messages. While you trying to figure out what's going on, they put on a timer on you with this ""Project Avatar"" thing, and you immediately feel a lot of pressure. Some missions are just crazy difficult, like those for Serpent King and Mad AI factory, and you don't expect this difficulty this early in the game.
Mid-game you finally have a chance to catch some breath and start working on some research, building and engineering, but here's the catch: the moment you get better in the game, the moment you upgrade your weapons and armour, the enemies suddenly become more powerful and armoured. You just don't have a chance to enjoy powerful things that you've made, because they quickly become just what is expected by default.
The end game comes unexpectedly, with a lot of pressure on you. It consists of two consecutive missions with no pause in between. If you got some units damaged in the first mission, you either will have to replace your best units or send them in wounded. The final mission is crazy, the amount of extremely powerful enemies is over the top, and it carries a lot of stress.
Given that the game is flawed with bugs in controls, has dumb battle mechanics that lead to absurd situations and very challenging overall even on lower difficulties, I would not recommend this game. | Le jeu en lui même est ok, War of the Chosen ajoute énormément au gameplay et est un incontournable pour XCOM 2. je vous recommande aussi d'utiliser des mods.

 | XCOM2の面白さを語るには、前作にして名作 XCOM: Enemy Unknown (以下XCOM:EU) と比較すると分かりやすいと思う

まず前作のXCOM:EUからあらゆる面で順当に進化しておりボリュームも増した
Steamワークショップ対応でMODも充実と欠点なし！と、損は無いのでセール時にはぜひ買ってプレイしてほしい

以上を大前提とした上で、そう⋯700時間以上もプレイ（最高難易度を最小部隊人数でクリア済）した上で私個人の見解を言わせてもらうと
XCOM:EUよりもゲーム性（ゲームとしての楽しさの意）は落ちてしまったと感じる
XCOM:EUはXCOM2よりも飽きの来る要素が多いはずなのに⋯だ！
※EUでは敵の配置が一部完全固定だったり⋯etc

繰り返し遊ぶゲームとしてみるとXCOM2の方が優秀なはずである
ではなぜ私はXCOM:EUの方がゲーム性が高いと言えるのか？
XCOM:EUのゲーム性はまるでパワプロなのだ
パワプロもメインイベントは決まった日に起こるはずなのに、何度もプレイしても楽しい

XCOM:EUではストーリーの進行と、ミッションが適切な間隔で詰まっており
兵士の計画的な育成（＝ビルドを組む楽しさ）と、時間制限（＝敵の更新／強化）
のバランスがすごい良かったのだ
そしてランダム性が少ないことが→上手くなれば、あらゆる要素を縛っても戦術で勝てる
など良い方向に働いたりした

一方でXCOM2では、多くの追加要素により楽しさも増したが、
その分ストーリーとミッションの関連性が薄れ、またタイムリミット枠の選ばれし者たちの介入は、
戦闘を長引かせる良くない要素の一つだと思う
選ばれし者自体はすごく面白いのだが、3人は多い！ゲームのかさ増しになってしまってる

ストーリーとレジスタンスの尻拭いを交互にやらされるのも間延びする原因だ
XCOM:EUでは助ける国と、見捨てる国の切り分けも緊張感を煽る良いスパイスだった
XCOM:EUでの上手くなるは「ゲームオーバーにならなければ見捨てて/切り捨ててOK」だった
XCOM2では上手くなると「滅亡カウンターがやばくなってきたから、そろそろ助けに行くか～」と、どの難易度でもなった
侵略されてXCOM:EUより悲惨なはずなのに、なんか緊張感にかけるのである
追加要素をプレイさせるために、滅亡までの時間にどうしても猶予が出来てしまったためだ
この点がゲーム性がXCOM:EUより落ちてしまったと感じる部分だ

難易度が上がると、どんどん無駄を減らすプレイングが重要で、駆け抜けるようなゲームプレイ感になるXCOM:EUと
研究や勢力や選ばれし者など、たくさんの要素からどっしり構えて戦略を練っていくXCOM2とプレイ感が違う
そしてたまたまXCOM:EUの方が私に合っていただけなのかも知れない

色々言ったがXCOM2のMODでの拡張性と、それに伴う豊富なキャラクリは本当に最高なので
みんなもお気に入りのキャラを作ってプレイしよう！

76561198082086866,429680,Spellweaver,10.966666666666667,"Free To Play, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, Strategy",2,"After trying many of the existing card games I must say that Spellweaver deserved to be known as it is probably the best proposal:

- A real and generous free to play
It's probably the one that you'll need the less grind to come up with a decent card collection as every single game you play gives you gold to buy new cards, with no daily restriction of any sort. This plus regular campaign missions makes it easy to buy new packs every day. You will NEVER have so spend a dime to get anything in this game, you can get it all by just playing.

- An efficient ressource system
The level/mana combo gives an interesting strategy approach and the possibility to exchange a card to pick a mana one every turn removes the death mana plays you can find in other games

- No RNG cards
Don't count on RNG cards to win a game. Yeah, you're in charge!

- Daily tournaments
Some for free, some with a ""ticket"" entry. Tickets can easily be bought with in-game gold. Various types of game proposed makes it interesting to play.

- You can even gain real money
Yes you read it right. Every month there is a minimum poll of 250$ plus a percentage of the money spent in the game by all the players given the winner of the monthly tournament. Did I say the registration for this tournament was free? A serious taunt to competitive players!

I really encourage to try this game and if you need a little boost to get started just let me know, I'd be happy to sponsor you in game which will grant you a nice 75k gold to start with when creating a new account. | I would give this game a neutral recommendation,but Steam won't allow that so until either that happens or the game improves,I keep it as a no.My reasons for it are the balance issues and some awkward rules. The game itself is good, if you like Magic: The gathering, you will probably like this too. 

You know something is not right when you look at the top 10 players and 6 of them are with a Darkness deck. Basically there are 2 strong factions and if you play anything else you will struggle to win. 
Unlike in most games there are no counterspells and no reaction phase where you can react to an enemy spellcast. Combined with the fact that Darkness for instance has really cheap ""Destroy Creature"" cards and by cheap I mean they are often cheaper than the creature they destroy. Yes,the enemy can instantly kill most of your creatures without you being able to keep them alive and does this with the same or fewer resources. 
Example: 
""Destroy a creature with 2 atk or less""-2 mana,level 1
My collection of ~250 DIFFERENT cards has no creature with the same or less cost that has 3 attack or more and most that have a higher manacost get destroyed by just this card as well.This game really needs to have weaker or more expensive creature shots.

I know it seems like a bad reason to not recommend something,but when you play 6-7 out of 10 games against the very same decks and basically have no chance to win unless you do it as well the whole thing becomes extremely repetitive and loses diversity. | I give this game something between good and bad. The mechanism is similar to MTG but better adapted for online. The art is very good and the game mechanism is mostly well developed, but the game is very inbalance and strategies are very rigid. I am playing several good CCG games and on this one it quickly become uninteresting and somewhat monotonous. 

Most matches are decided by a single card that the opponent or you can do nothing to counter. Also, by knowing what strategy you have and the opponent have you can guest know who is going to win, no matter the luck or how hard you play. There is no much strategy, besides the deck building, and winning decks are hevily based on golden cards. 

Some mechanism are confusing, like flying, or blocking. Same as MTG, lands are drawn from the deck. They tried to correct the luck factor with some weird mechanism, but it would be much better if players can freely choose how to manage the mana. 

The game has a lot of potential, but it need sharpness and balance. | I really wish i could give this game a full thumbs up, but for now it's pretty much sideways..
If you can see past the maze of (recurring) bugs/glitches & twitches, this game isn't actually all that bad really. It's still my favourite card game nonetheless! 
However it's likely never ever going to get properly fixed in that department, so i can't personally ""fully"" recommend this game..
It's still a very rewarding and fun card game however, so if you're looking for something like that (with lots of grinding if you're a collector etc) then it might just be your type of game. 
I've been playing this for some years now and still it randomly disconnects or crashes with no apparent reason on random occasions. >still happens at times<
It's a shame really because this card game could have been one of the absolute greats, sadly it doesn't quite delivers what it actually tries to promise.. (the dlcs are also somewhat pricey, though you can save up on Gold (or with the rarer Crystals) and get some with it instead -more grinding- of course)

Fun, complex but also with its flaws and shortcomings.

Personal score: 7'5/100 | I used to play the game but i decided to change my review from positive to negative.
The reasons are simple.
1)Developers have reduced the 2.000 dollar prize to mere 250 dollar.
2)The game doesnt have enough answers if combo decks like purple/blue plays the 4 5/5 flying drake he will start combo you until you are dead.Yes you pay 4 mana to do 5 damage but the problem is basic despina herself and the lack of game mechanic.When Drake's effect activates the game doesnt let you to answer against this combo and it started to get annoying.
3)lack of balance of some cards.Ghoul 3/3 was a fking example altough they did nerf it but after begging them for months.
4) and last reason i quitted is because cards like Grand Reunion and Skatador's binding simply they cant be removed because the game has very lower number of  removing spells from the field.Grand Reunion is most of times an auto win card.I hate when games dont have enough answers.Thats what mostly made me quit it.I hope they do better and learn the lesson because having no fking removals,having no fking answers against threats it turns the game to being toxic and being unfun."

Let me see. Today, this Friday night...I have been in a giant show which was excellently done with anime dancers. I climbed about a mile up in the sky with some people and then we dropped down. I have been in some sort of anime/game forest. I have been in a bowling alley which appeared very real, complete with 50s music and disco light :) I have been in a bar with about 20 people and a bar tender busy running around and serving drinks. I have been in an abandoned prison with scary ghosts, traps and all kinds of stuff. We have played games like CTF and we've been in an old Western town where we were the Sherrifs and shot some bad Bandit dudes :)

A lot of fun also with people showing off their insanely creative avatars. I took my headset off later on and realized that I ""experienced"" more things in one single night than a normal person could ever experience in ""real life"" in a night, uh..a week or a month even. This is just frickin' awesome beyond words.

From a technical point of view, the avatars are excellent and VRchat even allows making and importing your own from Unity. Lip sync, eye tracking and all. Some of the best avatars I have ever seen. The entire system seems polished and runs smooth.

VRChat must have hundreds of ""worlds"" including games etc. to choose from since you can browse them for an half an hour and still didn't see them all. This is crazy. Uh, that being said people can also design their own worlds and games and put them in there. Possibilites: Endless. MIND. BLOWN.

돌창소리 듣기 싫은 당신에게 이게임을 추천합니다
대신 당신은 이제 씹덕이라는 소리를 듣게되겠죠 | Yes, it's a lot lilke Hearthstone, a game I enjoy immensely.

BUT ... the quality of life touches in Shadowverse just make this game so much nicer to play.

- Deck codes allow you to import an entire deck list instead of building it card by card.
- Replay mode lets you review your last 10 games.
- Story mode is more challenging and interesting than the Hearthstone tutorial.
- Daily rewards just for logging in.
- THREE quests every day.
- Rewards for reaching milestones in Ranked play.
- Special events with even more achievements and unique rewards.
- Prebuilt decks available for purchase, allowing you a 100 percent chance of getting certain cards.

HOWEVER ... I've now played enough of the game to see that the balance is very heavily skewed toward high-end-combo play. Most games between competitive decks are just a race to see who can get the big legendary combo off first, or to see if you can play your combo before the other guy draws the counter. All other turns are rendered trivial, so in a lot of cases it just boils down to a coin toss.

I'm not going to take back my positive review because I really do admire the foundation. And I recognize that other people do like this style of gameplay; it's just not for me. So while I'm going to uninstall it after saving this revised review, I still think it's worth a try for those who like CCGs. It's free, after all, and they are pretty generous with the cards, even though you'll never get enough free cards to be competitive. | [h1]I LOVE THE DEVELOPERS![/h1]

I wasn't even online and I got a bunch of packs for 'bearing with them' as they had to delay the Bahamut release. Not many card game companies are this generous. You get so many rewards for levelling the leaders, playing the campaign, and just playing the game. Even the daily quests all 'cooldown' faster after you earn them all.

The daring complexity, the fantastic mechanics, and the overall amazing style of the game manages to make a [b]very[/b] balanced and enjoyable card game to play. And there's not a whole lot of RNG everywhere (fuck you Fiery Bat) that just plagues the game for no reason. When RNG is present, it's tastefully done and a small chunk of RNG is good for card games.

Easily one of the best card games and I'm glad it's finally on Steam! Linking my account to my Steam account was super easy.

My only suggestion to the developers is possibly making a more fulfilling arena experience by allowing us to get higher than 5 wins. I feel as though that's one thing Hearthstone did really well. | Shadowverse es un CCG de estetica anime, con similitudes sobretodo con el conocido Hearthstone. 

Sin embargo, a nuestro juicio su sistema de juego y mecánicas estan algo más pulidas.

Shadowverse es un juego free to play, y es ciertamente generoso con el nuevo jugador, llegando a otorgarle alrededor de 30 o 40 sobres iniciales una vez completados los primeros pasos y la campaña introductoria a las bases del juego que tiene. Por supuesto se pueden comprar booster packs con dinero real, si el jugador considera oportuno adquirirlos. Además el juego tiene cross-play entre Steam y Android, por lo que puedes jugar directamente con jugadores de la otra plataforma sin ningún problema, además puede conservar y traspasar tu progreso de un dispositivo a otro, por ejemplo si juegas en steam, pero te vas de viaje, puede pasar tu progreso a una tablet y seguir jugando Shadowverse alla donde vayas.

Con el paso del tiempo, en expansiones de Hearthstone se ha ido fomentando el juego agresivo, con mazos enfocados unicamente en ir a la cara del enemigo sin preocuparse lo mas minimo por el control de mesa. Que es el fundamento principal de base de un juego de cartas, por las posibilidades que te da..

Pero antes de nada deberemos empezar por contar los fundamentos básicos del juego, una de las características mas notorias, y que llama la atencion a primera vista del jugador, es que en shadowverse existe la mecanica de evolucionar a tus esbirros (llamados followers en el juego). Cuando se inicia una partida, se determina quien sale primero o segundo, la diferencia entre una y otra es que el primero posee la ventaja del tempo en cuanto a puntos de mana y 2 puntos de evolucion *de serie* a su disposicion, mientras que el que sale segundo cuanta con la ventaja de tener un punto de evolución más para un total de tres, y una carta adicional al empezar la partida.
Evolucionar un follower, normalmente supone otorgarle un +2/+2 (ataque/salud) a un esbirro y además se le concede la habilidad rush, que quiere decir que puede atacar a otro follower en el mismo turno en el que es jugado. No confundir con cargar, que recibe el nombre de storm en el juego, que en este caso si puede atacar directamente al heroe enemigo, pero como decimos no son muchos los followers con esta caracteristica de storm. Pero además existen followers que activan habilidades extras al ser evolucionados, normalmente a costa de ganar solo +1/+1 o de no ganar ningun stat, estas habilidades pueden ser desde causar un daño en área, sanar a tu heroe, etc...

**Nota: Al decir de serie nos referimos al empezar la partida, ya que hay formas de ganar puntos de evolucíon adicionales, con followers determinados por ejemplo que tiene la habilidad de recargar los puntos de evolución total o parcialmente.**

Los desarrolladores Cygames, estan trabajado en como resolver el hecho sabido por los jugadores, de que el que sale segundo en la partida cuenta con una ligera ventaja, de forma que se esta estudiando la forma de igualar la balanza para que uno u otro tengan la mismas posibilidades en funcion del orden en el que salgan. Segun las estadísticas facilitadas en el último noticeboard, hablamos de que una diferencia de alrededor de un 5% en relacion de winrate segun se salga primero o segundo.

Añadir que existen actualmente y a fecha de este análisis 7 clases disponibles:
- Forestcraft: Cuya habilidad consta de combar cartas activando efectos una vez se juegan 2 o mas cartas por turno
- Runecraft: Cuya habilidad llamada spellboost hace que las cartas con estas características vean reforzado su efecto cada vez que se lanza un hechizo
- Swordcraft: Cuya habilidad trata de jerarquías de cartas en relacion a oficial y comandante, activando efectos adicionales al tener comandantes en juego.
- Dragoncraft: La cual tiene como característica el ""overflow"" que se producen efectos de cartas al tener 7 puntos de mana o más.
- BloodCraft: La cual activa su habilidad característica al tener el héroe 10 o menos de vida.
- Shadowcraft: EL cual tiene como habilidad el usas la necromancia, es decir cada vez que un esbirro aliado muere, se suma un punto a un contador, que puede ser usado para activar distintos efectos.
- Havencraft: Que tiene como habilidad las cartas de countdwon, generalmente amuletos que tienen un fuerte impacto pero que necesitan de varios turnos para activarse, aunque puede reducirse este tiempo con otras cartas.

El caso es que en Shadowverse, el daño directo al jugador rival desde la mano, es muy dificil, tiene un alto coste, o requiere de un elaborado combo para llegar a hacerlo.
Esto no quiere decir que no existan en Shadowverse mazos agresivos, ya que por supuesto que los hay, sobretodo en clases como BloodCraft o Swordcraft entre otros, pero mayormente en shadowverse lo que impera es el intercambio de cartas / followers.

Por último decir que el juego esta bastante bien equilibrado en su mayoría, cada clase tiene muchas posibilidades y varias cartas key para orientar el mazo a un estilo de juego o caracteristica u otra función, mazos de descartes, mazos de sanación, mazos de combo...
A nuestro parecer solo existe una única carta que esta OP, llamada Daria, Dimensional Witch, la cual ha otorgado una gran popularidad a la clase runecraft (alrededor de 1/3 de jugadores actualmente), pero que se le puede ganar si sabes como contrarrestar su efecto.

Asi que querido lector, si estas indeciso, desde aqui te recomendamos que lo pruebes, es un juego que engancha y divierte, y si vienes de juegos como hearthstone, el período de aprendizaje es muy muy corto.

**Nota: El juego esta disponible en inglés, no en castellano, al menos a fecha de este análisis, aunque es cierto que es un ingles muy muy básico y que aun sin dominar el idioma, cualquier jugador puede hacerse a los menus y textos muy facilmente.

Un saludo | 一応おすすめですが、無料だし一回くらい手を付けても良いのでは？程度です。

幼いころから学生時代にかけて、遊戯〇やなんとかマスターズなどをプレイしていた事がありましたが・・・。このゲームは「デッキを１から自分で考える」というカードゲームの醍醐味が失われているように感じました。

パクリだとか、バランスが悪いとかそれ以前の問題に思えるのは私だけでしょうか。いや、それも問題なんですけどね。バランスが完璧になっても、結局他人のデッキコピーすれば同じことですよね。言いたいのはそういう事です。

一番呆れたのはデッキコードを入力すれば他人のデッキがそのまま使えるという、思考停止機能。そりゃプロが考えたデッキをコピれば素人でもある程度強くなりますよね。デッキはカード一覧を眺めて１から作るのが楽しいもんだと思っていたため、価値観の違いに驚きました。

ランクマッチで上にいけばいくほど、同じようなデッキばかりで面白くありません。どのカードゲームでもドラゴン使いでしたので、本作でもドラゴンのみを使い、ストーリーをクリアした後ランクマッチを重ね、先日B1ランクまで到達しましたが・・・コピーデッキはもういいです。彼らに遭遇した場合、勝っても負けても同じ手でくるから面白くないし、でてくるカードが全く同じだと笑えてすらきますね。それなら昔のカードゲームのCOMプレイヤーと変わりませんよ・・・。

悪いところばかり書いてしまいましたが、フルボイスでカードのデザインが綺麗な点は戦闘を盛り上げていますし、一部のバランスブレイカーを除けばなかなか遊べると思いますよ。ストーリーだけプレイして、コンピューター対戦の超級を制覇するだけでも無料にしては十分遊べるかと。フレンドとプレイも出来ますし。工夫があれば十分遊べるゲームだと思います。

例えば、使用禁止カードをお互い決めてデッキを組み、対戦するのも楽しいですよ。

カードゲームとして純粋に楽しみたいなら、カードの種類だけ情報を集め１からデッキ構築するか、２Pickがお勧めです。最初は負けていても、改良を重ねて勝利数が増えてくると嬉しいものです。人によってはデッキに愛着がわくかもしれません。

光る部分は十分あるゲームですので、今後改善を少しだけ期待しています。"
76561198082086866,205890,Unknown,5.8,,19,"Really a shame that this didn't get more attention from players. I find it to be refreshing, fun, addicting, and even the community is good. It's a card game where you play it like a board game and it's up to you to predict what your opponent is going to do and try to react accordingly. 

The most unique part of this game is that you play FOUR cards at ONCE. Every turn, both players! And there's no mana. If that doesn't get you at least interested, I don't know what to say.

People talk about grind in f2p, (which is what put me off of HS) and grind is part of RuneScape, so that label almost put me off of this game. Which I think happened to a lot of people, and that's a shame. 

If you're looking for a fun, free-to-play card game with some twists and isn't a chore, here it is. | C'est dommage ce jeu avait tout pour se démarquer :
- un système de jeu original différent réellement des autres TCG
- une ambiance originale
- des cartes bien équilibrées offrant des possibilités de decks vraiment très nombreuses
- une économie saine pas de pay to win, de vrais boosts réguliers pour les f2p ou juste ceux ne désirant pas lâcher leur salaire tous les mois dans des boosters

Mais :
- Jagex a presque été silencieux depuis le début, et n'a quasiment fait aucune promo, et n'a organisé aucun tournoi (TCG = esport et spectacle en streaming de nos jours, sans ça il y a vraiment une perte de valeur)
- n'a quasiment rien ajouté depuis sa sortie
- a laissé traîné des sales bugs sans s'en occuper et qui au bout d'un an de jeu deviennent plus qu'horripilants
- a fini de tuer ma motivation avec l'ajout de bonus f2p obligeant à se connecter tous les jours sans en rater un seul... (quasiment tous les éditeurs ont compris que les gens avaient une vie à côté des TCG et qu'il pouvait arriver qu'on ne se connecte pas pendant plus de 24h, me^me pour récupérer un bonus... d'autant que ce système à la noix est un système de f2p mobile qui s'y adapte beaucoup car on peut ouvrir ces jeux et récupérer les bonus en speed entre deux portes même si on n'a pas le temps de jouer...)

En gros, pendant longtemps, j'ai recommandé ce jeu, mais aujourd'hui un constat doit être fait...
Le jeu est plus ou moins à l'abandon, la communauté, même si motivée ne fait que rétrécir, et aucun effort ne semble vouloir être fait pour résoudre les anciens bugs et planifier le futur. 
Donc, devant le nombre de TCG de qualité de nos jours, je ne peux pas recommander ce jeu, même si ça me fend le coeur, et moi-même je lui dis Adieu aujourd'hui, le coeur gros du gâchis d'un si bon jeu. | 好游戏，暂时没有遇到网络爆炸，你在发现卡顿了就退出重上就好，不会说中途网络爆炸断线什么的。如果重上卡顿的话。。。找别的游戏玩一下......另外，为啥不能在游戏里充值？！

Es wurde mir durch einen sehr guten Freund vorgeschlagen, da er wusste, dass ich spiele wie ""The Operator"" absolut feiere. Sagen wirs mal so: ich wurde NICHT enttäuscht. die ganze Aufmachung des Spiels ist etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig, allerdings ist das Zweitrangig. Für jeden der sich in solche Art von Mysterien fest beisst ist das hier eine absolute Goldgrube, so viele unbeantwortete Fragen, es ist so verstrickt, dass man In der ersten Stunde zwar schon ein ungefähres Bild bekommt, was passiert sein muss, aber durch die Anzahl an Personen die in der Geschichte vorkommen, einfach keine handfesten Theorien aufstellen kann, man wird mit Brotkrümeln gefüttert, aber man wird nicht Satt davon. Absolut geiles Erlebnis, freue mich auf Teil 2.

Ach, und die Dialoge sind teilweise absoluter Lachkick. Spiele für gewöhnlich Sachen nur auf Englisch, aber die Deutschen Texte sind sehr Realitätsnah, von Internet-Trolls bis absolut grenzwertigen Beleidigungen alles dabei

100/10

Könnte ich meine Erinnerung an das Game löschen und es nochmal spielen, würd ichs tun. | When my only real complaint is why isn't there more, that's not really a problem. The fact the writing and score make a text-based story compelling and chilling enough to keep me glued to my seat shows how well written this game is. | Allora, innanzitutto va detto che il gioco è solamente testuale (molta roba da leggere, sia utile a stabilire un ""ambiente"" realistico, sia informazioni) perciò non aspettatevi azione nel senso classico, piuttosto aspettatevi di indagare...e riflettere, anche se sul secondo punto sono abbastanza confuso.
C'è poco da aggiungere al titolo, Orwell cita ovviamente l'autore di 1984 dove in una società distopica, le persone sono costantemente spiate per il bene di una nazione in cui non esiste alcuna opposizione.
Orwell è la piattaforma che andremo ad utilizzare, ""l'occhio"" del governo che attraverso indiscriminate ricerche e libere estrapolazioni di dati da social media, account bancari, cellulari, computer, dati medici e via dicendo sarà nostro compito assicurare alcuni ""terroristi"" (se lo siano o meno è vostro compito scoprirlo, e qui un altro problema che sorge) alla giustizia.
Qual'è il confine se esiste fra privacy e sicurezza? Ci abbiamo già rinunciato entrando nei social media e dando le nostre informazioni a qualsiasi sito le chieda? Paranoia o realtà? Se non abbiamo nulla da nascondere, cosa ci importa? 
Ma quali sono i criteri per esseri considerati ""un pericolo""? Magari si comincia con cose serie ma poi si arriva al conformismo totale sospettoso di qualsiasi differenza?
Queste solo alcune delle domande che il gioco pone, forse in maniera un pò ""guidata"" (alla fine la libertà di pensiero significa che il pensiero non deve essere influenzato) in certe parti, ma se all'inizio può sembrare avvincente indagare e collegare punti fra i vari indizi che prenderemo senza troppi scrupoli con qualche click da diversi metodi....alla fine rimarrà un pò di amarezza.
Perchè ...se capitasse veramente a voi? Mettiamo sia tutto complottismo e paranoia, ma se potesse accadere?
Non siamo poi così lontani, e le notizie del gioco rimandano a fatti reali ovviamente con nomi e tempi diversi.
Lo consiglio, non dura molto, si finisce in 7 ore, è completamente tradotto, ci sono delle piccole sbavature (soprattutto confusione fra gender o nomi di persone, o frasi tradotte troppo letteralmente dall'inglese)
Non credo comprerò il seguito, totalmente in inglese e che a quanto ho letto non è pari a questo.
Non mi ha ""sbalordito"" enormemente, ma fa pensare sia in termini di soluzione di alcuni ""enigmi"" che di temi etici.
Molto pratica la UI e piacevole l'utilizzo di ritratti disegnati in modo molto minimal.
Consigliato a chi ama i giochi di scelte e conseguenze che poi scopri che era tutto un equivoco.

【第一印象】
发现这个游戏的时候是我真的闲的无聊看看免费游戏，结果就发现了！
本人很喜欢像素风（8-bit）的游戏！还有RPG类型的！
开始玩的时候，新手教程是“老练囚犯”，当时就觉得这个人物好好玩。
接着又打了几盘人机。电脑跟你打从来不怂的，1V3的时候经常有，开局一会儿就三杀了。每次死了一两次后都会想“要不我也像电脑那样不怂？试试看”，结果每次都是送送送……
最后一盘就是占领祭坛（反正我是这样叫的），每次都有电脑跑去站，然后我就一直骚扰，每次都把他打死在祭坛里面，还是占领不了……心疼自己智商。

【游戏趣味性】
1.像素风（8-bit）。如果有一点点信仰的玩家第一眼都会喜欢的吧。
2.游戏模式。稍微有一点点枯燥，就是杀杀杀，DieDieDie。希望官方以后出一点娱乐模式or剧情模式（就像RPG类做任务）~
3.关于游戏里的人物。三个（还是几个记不住了）周免人物，没有玩过的人物可以练练手。如果有自己很喜欢或者玩的很溜的人物，但是又只是周免的，可以考虑花一点点钱（比如“老练囚犯” 6R），买一个人物。如果所有英雄都喜欢或者玩的溜或者信仰充值或者单纯喜欢游戏或者想支持作者的可以买下40R的DLC！说真的40R的DLC不算贵！一顿饭钱~（我只是推荐大家花点小钱支持作者，并没有提倡说不吃饭买……）

【好评的理由】
1.免费游戏好伐？！这都不给好评？游戏素质也还算不错！
2.像素风（8-bit）这点就给很多信仰玩家加分！
3.很多人物，很耐玩。
4.电脑的智商在我的眼里还算蛮高的。
5.DLC40R良心好伐？不想花钱玩人物的也可以在游戏里刷游戏币买啊！
6.很多关卡、很多技能、武器，应该来说玩不腻。（上面我说的游戏模式枯燥指的是单纯杀杀杀枯燥啊……）
7.占的内存很少……300MB，对于我这种渣渣宽带来说so easy。
8.支！持！简！体！中！文！

【差评的理由】
1.服务器问题真的很大好伐。欧洲服务器300ping，到亚洲服务器直接到了600ping，突然感觉我是欧洲人了呢！（并不，还是非洲的）
2.人物、技能平衡性有点差。具体什么情况还是自己玩玩，就知道了。

【总结】
大概就差不多了~反正我很喜欢这个游戏，已经准备花钱购买人物了。
信仰充值。
玩这个游戏，走位很重要啊！！！蛇皮走位！！！拿象拔蚌去走位都可以！！！

毕竟作者花了这么多时间去做游戏，开放是免费的，也就只有DLC赚赚钱。还是一句话，支持作者，让作者有把游戏完善下去的动力！

【感谢。】

3.19.2017 修改评论。 | 運営にやる気があるようでこまめにアップデートされており、新キャラクターも短期間で多く追加され、不具合も改善され、キャラ相性はあるものの強キャラ弱キャラの差はそこまで感じず、公開初日からこのゲームを見ているが初期に比べるとかなり良ゲーになった。
しかし公開されて数日間サーバーの不具合によってオンラインに他の人の部屋が見えないという、オンライン専用ゲームにおいて致命的な不具合があったため最初にプレイ人数を獲得できなかったのが痛い失敗かと思われる。
その為今も人数が足りずチームランクマッチ戦がしにくくなっているが、個人ランクマッチやフリー部屋やドラゴン討伐部屋等は機能しているので十分楽しめる。

簡単にまとめると、

～良い点～
・良アップデートがこまめに行われる
・キャラクターが多い(2017/1/27現在15体)
・キャラバランスが良い
・不具合修正が早い
・全キャラに別コスチュームがある(アプデにより3つ以上あるキャラも)


～悪い点～
・不具合内容が致命的な物が多い(サーバー接続不可、壁に埋まる等)
・プレイヤーが少ない
・ドラゴン討伐の難易度が高い(人によってはやりごたえがあり良い点)
・対戦中に抜ける人が多い
・ゲーム内マネーが貯まり難い(最近はデイリーボーナス実装で少しは集めやすいかも？)


2017/1/27現在の最近の評価が「賛否両論」となっているが、人数不足からきているものだと思われる。
ゲーム内容自体は非常に好評でもおかしくないので、評価を見るより先に一度プレイすることをオススメしたい。 | Upon first impression, this game appeared to be a sort of dungeon scroller type game. But once I started playing this game showed it's true colors. A quirky 8-bit styled MOBA that introduce a wide range of characters. Liked the intuitive tutorial, but later found the game to grow a bit stale. What got me the most was that you'll have to pay for the pack to unlock all the different characters instead of earning in-game money to purchase whichever hero you desired.

This would work better as a dungeon crawler. With online connectivity to enjoy with local friends or people around the world. | 本体免费，英雄也很便宜，游戏体验良好。
我相信这个游戏随着时间的推移游戏内容丰富和调整之后会更加优秀，目前游戏内容还有点匮乏。
加油。 | 一个的确有意思的小游戏，十分耐玩也值得重复玩耍

Having played Civ 7 for a few hours now, I can say that that those of us who truly loved and still love Civ 5 judged Civ 6 too harshly when it released. It changed some things that people liked, but I still found many of its new features truly enjoyable on launch. I had fun. I still preferred 5, but in 6 the art, the music, the innovations to unrest, espionage, religion, and--to a lesser extent--city development were all excellent. Heroes are cool. The roster is cool. Civ 7 has little that is as redeeming in it at launch and I wholeheartedly recommend 6 instead. | Great game and recommended if you are a strategy player. Looking forward to the new game soon! | Гра чудова, подобається різноманіття можливих стратегій розвитку цивілізацій. 

З негативного на мій погляд - викривлення певних історичних контекстів. Простежується культурна апропріація. 
Як наприклад Києво-Печерська Лавра - серце України в реальності,  є особливою спорудою російської імперії у грі... Як зокрема і унікальний юніт - козаки, що у реальності початково виникли як соціальний клас саме у степах України.
 Дуже нериємно це бачити, особливо в умовах, коли росія щодня знищує наші міста в реальності...

 | 非常杀时间的游戏，经常一开始玩就忘记时间了，看着文明不停地发展，心里也会有种成就感，只是这个画风有点卡通了，要是能够写实点就好了😁😁😁 | Нові стратегічні рішення та чудова графіка.
Але важко уявити, що в 2025 році ми все ще змушені бачити у світі ігор проросійські наративи. У новій версії гри розробники ""відзначилися"" черговим ігноруванням української локалізації та повного ігнорування української нації, яка переживає героїчну боротьбу за своє існування та незалежність.  

Анонс нового персонажа, цариці-душогубки, яка нав'язується як ""символ культури та просвітництва"", виглядає як зневага до мільйонів українців. Героізація імперіалістичної постаті — це не тільки обурливо, але й аморально в контексті війни та окупації, яку сьогодні переживає наша країна.  

Українці заслуговують на повагу в індустрії відеоігор, а не на спроби просувати імперський наратив під виглядом ""культурних цінностей"". Досить толерувати пропаганду! Вимагаємо повноцінної української локалізації, українських героїв і персонажів, які реально відображають нашу історію, культуру та боротьбу.

It's hard to believe that in 2025 we are still witnessing pro-Russian narratives in the gaming industry. In the latest version of the game, the developers once again ignored Ukrainian localization and completely erased the Ukrainian nation, which is heroically fighting for its survival and independence.  

The announcement of a new character, a tsarina-murderer being portrayed as a ""symbol of culture and enlightenment,"" is a slap in the face to millions of Ukrainians. Glorifying an imperialist figure is not only outrageous but also immoral in the context of the war and occupation Ukraine is enduring today.  

Ukrainians deserve respect in the gaming industry, not an attempt to promote imperial narratives disguised as ""cultural values."" Enough with the propaganda! We demand full Ukrainian localization, Ukrainian heroes, and characters that truly reflect our history, culture, and struggle."

Но это как с перцем, который жжётся дважды. Или яхтой из Рок-н-ролла. Как от любой ККИ получаешь истинное наслаждение дважды: когда начинаешь в неё играть и когда бросаешь это нафиг. | Люблю карточные рогалики. Люблю гексагональные тактические битвы.

Нет, нет, не того прекрасного рогаликового рандома, который дарит разнообразие каждой битвы, и заставляет тебя на лету придумывать тактики, а рандома - когда у врага просто может выпасть карта ""Я победил, ха-ха-ха"" или у тебя карта ""А чего ты мне сделаешь?"", и зачем ты собирал крутую колоду остаётся загадкой. Плюс это порт мобильный донатной игры. | Faeria is fun. Okay, I can see myself spending 10 more hours on fighting AI on Pandora Mode. I already spent 28 hours. The rest of the game depends if I can push myself over the skill cliff of deckbuilding, because it's really hard. I can recommend this game very easily. I get to max out the utility of every monster, every decision, and win a lot.

But let's go into the reasons why this game isn't successful. NOTE: I go against AI and don't really compete.
- Faeria looks like a typo to a lot of search engines. It's very close to Fairy.
- You don't get to walk around. Like every other trading card game, you battle and these battles can get lengthy. There's no rest stop besides staring at the card collection.
- The campaign mode is fighting random NPCs with one-liners and that's it. There's no story, no satisfying closures besides winning, no secrets to unlock beyond the loot boxes of cards. The boss battles do have that unfair advantage, but there's no extra flair to them so they still look like normal NPCs to fight. While you are building a card collection, most people won't feel the dopamine of progress.
- In a fair match, the tension is not there for a lot of mid games. You either steamroll or get steamrolled. This might be because I play very defensively and haven't touched the aggressive cards. This might also be b/c I don't play competitively. I like steamrolling, but variety is the spice of life.
- Most of us will never ever beat this game, because the hard challenges are really hard. Many games can split the difficulty into Easy Mode, Normal Mode, and Hard Mode. This game doesn't split those modes, it blends them all together (easy stuff first ofc) and you know, not everyone wants to play Hard Mode. Like I said, my next 10 hours are probably going to be Pandora Mode and ignore the rest of it.
- I've fallen into playing very defensively. Like I ALWAYS go for the faeria well on the first turn. This might be a me problem, but I feel like it's the strongest strat.

What is Pandora Mode? You build a random deck 1 card at a time and play 6 random NPCs in a FAIR match. And there's rewards for it.

But again, I like the game. But again, I like utilizing every card to the most of its ability, being very goal-orientated when I place new land, and then steamrolling my AI opponents."

76561198082086866,507490,Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation,0.0,"Simulation, Strategy",0,"Ashes of the Singularity carries a familiar essence, particularly for fans of Supreme Commander. The influence is undeniable, and I could feel its spirit seeping through the gameplay. The campaign offers a solid, well-structured experience, while the multiplayer delivers the standard fare you’d expect from an RTS. That, in essence, is the theme of this game—it doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it delivers a polished and well-executed version of familiar mechanics.

My biggest gripe is the unit design. Many units look too similar, which can make it difficult to differentiate them at a glance. Additionally, the two main factions, while distinct in playstyle, share a somewhat uniform aesthetic, which makes them feel less visually unique than they could be.

On the positive side, the game excels in its command and control mechanics. The speed at which you can build, group, and maneuver your forces is impressive. The V key will quickly become your best friend, as it allows you to form cohesive armies that support one another effectively. However, the attack-move function can be a bit frustrating—frontline units will engage while those in the rear sometimes idle instead of pushing forward. The best workaround is to avoid attack-move and instead overshoot your target, ensuring your forces spread out and engage as intended.

If you find Ashes of the Singularity on sale and have a soft spot for Supreme Commander, it’s absolutely worth picking up. I’ve had a great time with it, and despite some minor flaws, it delivers an enjoyable large-scale RTS experience. | I wish more games would take this approach its simple but not halo wars simple(love that game too btw). | Once you get the hang of it, it is fun.

UPDATE 10/14/18
[h1] Description	[/h1]
Maplestory 2 is an MMO-RPG that is theme-park based where you go through the various locations within Victoria Island and complete quests. It is rather linear with its story however there is plenty of content ranging from dungeons, questing, PVP,  life-skilling and mini-games. There is more depth as well as complexity and has a beautiful, expansive world, unique enemy design, easy combat and a very great social aspect within which makes MS2 certainly a step up from its predecessor. With all aspects in mind, this is not a serious MMO like WOW or BDO with emphasis on grinding away for gear or PVP'ing but instead is a casual MMO with emphasis on its social aspects.

[h1] Pros 	[/h1]
+Easy to learn combat
+Community is very social and when you eventually get bored grinding you have the possibility to make friends through a guild,minigames or talking with others in populated towns. 
+An abundant amount of content ranging from life-skills, decorating a house,learning how to play an instrument and the trophy system
+Diverse customization within character skill trees and cosmetics (Free to reset skill tree and there is  a User Generated Content market that sells cosmetics for cheap.)
+Customizable controls 
+Unique graphics
+Doesn't require a good computer to play
+Learning curve isn't steep
+Compared to other games, you don't have to spend a ton of time to have fun and or get to endgame.
+Gamepad usability
+Great soundtrack
+Content is accessable to everyone aslong as they have the gear or level for it. (Berg Island & Hard Dungeons)

[h1] Neutral [/h1]
•Linear and dull story that holds your hand for the most part
•Strengths/weaknesses of classes is only found through experience
•Pay 4 convience as there are 0 items you can buy with money that DIRECTLY strengthens your own character with better gear (Premium club, Meret market with elixirs and auto-gathering badges)
•Soft cap at level 50/ gearscore 1500 
•Limited and repetitive end-game progression and content that is prevalent in almost every MMO.
•Cheap premium club price if you'd like to support Nexon/take advantage of its benefits


[h1] Cons  [/h1]
-Overpriced cosmetics set only by Nexon
-Combat gets VERY dull after a while with characters spamming the same 1 to 4 abilities on the mobs until they die
-Bugs and Errors 
-Can't use the mouse to aim which is decieveing for one of the controls options | The dopest MMORPG I've ever played. My friend, this is like if the original MapleStory met Phantasy Star Universe and they had a baby, and then meanwhile, Minecraft and Final Fantasy Worlds met and had a baby, and by some miracle, those two babies met and had a baby of their own, this would be what they birthed.

It's cute, great fun, and very addicting. More importantly, it's an MMORPG that's easy to play and accommodate to, even if you aren't familiar with MMOs or RPGs. If you want a game that keeps you in a not-so-serious and upbeat mood while requiring some serious combat, the opportunity to raid and socialize/teambuild, and some invested thought in character/skill building with the potential for multiple characters, this is definitely for you.

The best part about MapleStory 2 is that there are SO many things to do! Naturally, for all of the best parts, there are some cons--but it seems unavoidable with MMORPGs.

There's a Main Quest that's soloable, as well as World Quests that you can find at random from NPCs around the World Map. Some parts of this require grinding to be able to beat the Dungeon Bosses/Finish the Quest Bosses (I haven't experienced much of a slowdown thus far and I'm LV 25)...This could also present troublesome news for more intense MMORPG-drawn gamers who prefer to stretch out their Levelling: I'm at 23 hours of gameplay and I'm around LV 25, so while that's a great pace for me, I'm sure that spells irritability for others.

You have the ability to build your own house--I spent a solid 3 hours building, and I ONLY put down the FLOOR. I haven't even gotten to my walls or interior yet!--and there's so many options to go with--so many interior design possibilities--it's sometimes overwhelming (Thank goodness for mini-game breaks). This definitely hooks those of us who could spend 3 hours making their Sims and their respective houses, and offers a lot of potential for customization. They even offer trophies, quests, rewards and EXP for doing it. 

My only gripe with the housing system that there isn't any kind of mass area select, so you're left to drop every. single. block. down. one. at. a. time. It can grow weary on the eyes when laying a foundation, and you lose sight of the bigger picture if you have a goal in mind. Also, if you're playing on a controller, prepare to be forced into mouse+keyboard play, because there are some aspects and keybindings of house building that are too expansive for a controller. It takes a LOT of patience to build your own place, but if you're Minecraftian or used to piece-by-piece building for the end result, this won't be an empasse for you.

Mini-Games! They offer lovely breaks in-between whatever it is you're doing--whether it be the Quests, grinding, or house building--and they're always welcomed! You aren't required to participate, of course, but I definitely recommend trying them. Among a few others, there's the musical-chairs-esq Dance Dance Stop, and a Quiz Game that will leave you feeling moronic for succumbing to mob mentality, but always joyous in spirit. You can earn EXP from these games, as well as Trophies.

The classes you can pick from are typical among MMOs (Wizard, Priest, Assassin, Thief, Warrior, etc.), and the skills are just the same. Seasoned MMO gamers will find nothing new here, and the Skill Tree you build will definitely seem droll compared. Those of us who aren't so limber will enjoy the different combination of skills you can make, as well as the ability to ""take back"" the skills immediately for no cost--this allows you to rebuild your tree, and use completely different skills if you so desire, which helps a lot during certain Bosses.

Character customization, surprisingly, offers quite a varied, free selection to start off with, and even equipment is customizable for Mesos (free in-game currency). If you're willing to pay, your character will look exactly the way you'd love--but boy, do you have to pay. Each piece of the latest Halloween ensemble will run your bill up over $100. But hey, you'll look cute.

In regards to paid, in-game currency (not free Mesos)--there are two kinds: Blue Merets which you've paid for using real-world cash, and Red Merets you've earned in-game, somehow (I earned some and don't remember how). I got a Founder's Pack with 2,000 Merets, only bought some furniture, and still have 400 left with no idea what to spend it on strategically. That said, I sincerely hope it stays that way.

All of the above options are strictly cosmetic, so don't expect to buy your way into the best equipment--just the most kawaii fashion shows. It's definitely not P2W.

They make it quite easy to come across other players and connect. You can create custom chat tabs where you can see exactly what you want--users, guilds, party, etc. You can head to the most populated areas and look for people to chat up, and you can even speak during the Mini-Games. There have even been points where you see someone struggling through a Boss and you can step in at any point to help them beat it, whether it benefits you or not (at minimum, you get EXP for the encounter). There's also no fighting over loot, as everyone only sees their own gains.

Nexon has already improved in-game Channel spam, and I definitely see the difference they've implemented. AVADA KEDAVRA MESO SCALPERS!

MapleStory 2's gameplay is very fluid and smooth--the only issues I've experienced thus far that linger in my memory long enough to truly bother me have been with House building--when you lay down too many blocks, the system seemingly begins to lag when placing them down (but I don't know if this is my internet connection or the server? I have over 200Mbps and don't have problems on other MMOs, but who knows). 

The MapleStory 2 storyline for the Main Quest, and most of the World Quests can read as very juvenile, but it's totally supposed to be (The analogy in the first paragraph rings true here). There's no obligation to actually invest in the story or the characters, you always have the option to skip the cutscenes and go for the gold--although I love me some Joddy.

Imagine, I've only explored a portion of this game in my 25 levels and 23 hours of gameplay (Updating this review at level 30+ with 70+ hours) and I have this much to say about it. I'm so, so excited to do more. There's fishing, mining, trophies and quests that unlock items and customization options, racing, pets...just...so much to do! Saying ""Yes"" to one thing in MapleStory 2 is saying ""No"" to hundreds of other in-game possibilities.

It's free on the 10th, so what do you have to lose? Jump into Maple World for yourself and let's find out! | Hola! Antes que nada quiero decir que no soy un experto en dar reseñas pero esta es mi sincera opinion:
Este juego realmente es bueno de hecho uno de los mejores mmo que he probado en este 2018, simplemente te envicia y te da muchas horas de divercion.
Bueno:
-Es divertido (a mi parecer).
-No necesitas una pc de la nasa para correrlo.
-Te ofrece muchas horas de juego
-Siempre hay algo que hacer.
-Ahora no es free pero lo sera el 10/10/2018.
-Hay servidores en SA(Soy de Ecuador y haun asi me va bien).
-Jugabilidad y clases para gustos y colores.
-No es P2W.

Malo:
-No se si es problema mio pero solo en los servidores de sa me saca de repente(Probablemente no les pase).
-En el momento de luchar contra boss siempre va a ver tirones de promedio.
-El juego esta en Ingles deben saber un poco para enterder la historia o simple mente jugenlo ala mandita sea y ya...
-Los precios de la tienda(Dentro del juego)son muy caros ej: 100M-5$ 1000M-15$ 2500M-25$ quiero aclarar cobran mucho por lo que dar, quiero decir una gorra simpe cuesta 150M. M=Merets=Moneda del juego.
-Los servidores de sa estan petados de brazucas XD (espero que vengan mas latinos cuando sea free) Igual todos son buena onda.

Resumen: Esta fue mi sincera opinion si hay algo que no te gusta simplemente no lo compres pero realmente deberias darle una oportunidad ya que este juego es famoso en asia y le han dado la oportunidad a america de traernoslo. tiene puntos buenos y malos como todo juego y esta en beta(actualmente 8/10/2018).Pero bueno es tu desicion comprarlo ahora o esperas a que este free.

Recomendado: Si/Gracias por leer^^ | Primeira vez que recomendo um jogo na steam, sempre procurei uma alternativa ao sentimento que Ragnarok me trazia, encontrei. | I've sadly never got to experience Maplestory 1 (was a runescaper), but having put in around 15 hours so far (and much more to come) I can safely say this is definitely a game worth investing hours into. There is so much to do from life skills, to raiding/dungeons, to just chilling in the house you made with your own creativity. It's a very beginner friendly mmorpg to get into that leads into great keyboard mechanics and timings in the end game. From what I'm told from my friends who played the original maple, this game is definitely a well aged and upgraded sequel. There are no evident pay to win implementations, just pay to progress like xp boosts (but it's easy to hit level cap), and with the user generated items (like t-shirts and wall scrolls) in game, this game just has limitless possibilities on creativity. 

There's nothing more to say about this game, other than now it is going free to play and is definitely worth checking out if you even have a little interest in the game. There really is nothing to lose just by trying this game, other than maybe your time, but it'll be worth it in the end."

With the number of hours I'd played I even spent over 100$ supporting the game by buying skins and what not. I enjoyed the flow, the challenge, and the strategy. I know every card. How they're played. How they're countered. 

So why am I giving it a negative review now?  I recently came back to it to find out the game had completely changed. 

Why oh why have the devs decided to remove wild cards (doubles of the same card in the same deck) and duplicate cards (the same card in your teammates deck) in premade team battles?? Half the fun of this game was being able to strategize with a friend and come up with crazy combos, thematic decks, and sometimes just plain goofy ridiculous decks early in the league. I strongly believe the percent chance of drawing a deck defining card or executing your intended combo is a key element of dueling cards in general. Think Magic or Yu Gi Oh. Now a huge part of that fun and build design is just gone.

Effectively, they've changed the game that I originally fell in love with and after over 800 hours I don't think I want to play anymore. What a shame. | Rating: 7/10

Overview: Minion Masters is a fast-paced, free-to-play strategy game that blends elements of tower defense and collectible card games (CCG). Developed by BetaDwarf, the game pits players in 1v1 or 2v2 battles where they summon and control minions to battle against their opponent’s forces, all while managing a deck of cards. With its unique mix of gameplay styles, Minion Masters offers an accessible but strategic experience for fans of both strategy games and card battling.

Gameplay: In Minion Masters, players build and use decks of cards to summon minions, cast spells, and build structures on the battlefield. Each card corresponds to a different type of unit, spell, or structure that players can deploy in real-time. The key to success is not just about deploying powerful units but also about managing your resources (mana), timing your plays, and reacting to your opponent’s strategy.

The game offers several different modes, including standard 1v1 and 2v2, where players can compete against other players or AI. The matches are quick, lasting around 5-10 minutes, which makes it easy to jump into a game and not get bogged down by long sessions. The action is fast-paced, with constant back-and-forth gameplay, making it exciting for those who enjoy real-time strategy with a bit of card game strategy mixed in.

Deck Building and Strategy: The strategic depth of Minion Masters comes from deck building. Players can collect new cards and customize their deck to suit their playstyle, with different minions, spells, and special abilities available to choose from. The key to winning is finding the right balance between offense and defense, while also considering synergy between the cards in your deck. There are a variety of minion types, each with strengths and weaknesses, which adds an extra layer of tactical decision-making to each match.

Progression and Monetization: As with many free-to-play games, Minion Masters includes a progression system where players can unlock new cards and cosmetics by earning rewards from matches or purchasing card packs. While the game is generally balanced and not pay-to-win, there is an option for players to spend money on card packs and other cosmetic items. This could give some players a slight advantage early on, but most progress can still be made through regular gameplay.

Graphics and Performance: Minion Masters features bright, colorful visuals with a somewhat cartoonish art style that fits the fast-paced, playful nature of the game. The minions and spells are well-designed, with each card having its own unique look and animations that help bring the battlefield to life. The game runs smoothly on most systems, and the controls are intuitive, making it accessible for both new players and strategy veterans alike.

Audio Design: The sound design in Minion Masters is solid, with an upbeat soundtrack and engaging sound effects that add to the excitement of the battles. Each card and minion has its own set of sounds, from the footsteps of marching troops to the explosive effects of spells, helping to immerse players in the game’s action. The voice lines of the minions and the announcer are charming and add some personality to the game.

Challenges: While Minion Masters is accessible, there is a learning curve when it comes to building effective decks and mastering the timing and positioning of your units. As players unlock more cards, they can start building more diverse strategies, but the game’s fast pace means you need to react quickly, which can be challenging for newcomers. The game also features matchmaking, but occasionally, you may find yourself up against opponents who have stronger cards if you're not progressing quickly enough.

Final Thoughts: Minion Masters is a fun and fast-paced strategy game that offers a unique blend of collectible card gameplay with real-time strategy. Its quick matches, deck-building mechanics, and strategic depth make it an enjoyable experience for players who enjoy both card games and strategy games. While there’s a progression system that could feel grindy at times, the game remains accessible, and its focus on skill and strategy makes it rewarding for those who stick with it.

Pros:

Fast-paced and accessible gameplay
Strong strategic depth through deck-building and unit placement
Bright, colorful visuals with appealing animations
Free-to-play with fair monetization options
Multiple game modes including 1v1 and 2v2
Cons:

Progression can feel slow at times
Pay-to-progress elements, though not pay-to-win
Some balancing issues, especially at early levels
Can become repetitive if not switching up strategies
Minion Masters is an enjoyable strategy game for those who like quick battles, tactical decision-making, and card collection. While there are some minor progression hurdles, the game offers a solid and fun experience for fans of competitive, strategic gameplay. | This game was fun for a while. I found it late thinking it was a new game. After several months of loving it and playing it almost daily; the fun is now at its end. Nothing new is coming to it. | ""Если бы мне сказали, что я буду проводить ночи напролет, крича на экран из-за толпы миньонов, я бы не поверил. Но вот я здесь, с кругами под глазами и улыбкой до ушей. Minion Masters — это как смесь покера, шахмат и цирка, где все участники слегка не в себе.

Что мне нравится:

Миньоны-психопаты. Серьезно, кто еще будет бросать летающих свиней в драконов? Это гениально!

Стратегия? Шутка? И то, и другое! Ты думаешь, что всё продумал, но тут твой противник выкидывает карту, которая превращает твою армию в лягушек. Лягушек, Карл!

Быстрые матчи. Это как фастфуд, только без угрызений совести. 5 минут — и ты либо герой, либо лузер. Но в любом случае хочется еще.

Что не нравится:

Случайные карты. Иногда тебе выпадает такая рука, что хочется плакать. Но это часть веселья, правда?

Итог: Minion Masters — это идеальная игра для тех, кто хочет немного адреналина, много смеха и возможность почувствовать себя злым гением (или просто неудачником с хорошим чувством юмора). Если вы еще не играли, то что вы вообще делаете со своей жизнью?

76561198082086866,412310,Labyrinth,0.0,"Free To Play, Indie, RPG, Strategy, Early Access",0,"Labyrinth, если пытаться отнести к какому-то жанру, можно определить как TCCG (тактическая коллекционная карточная игра), хотя здесь вы найдете и элементы Dungeons & Dragons, настольных игр, CardHunter, пошаговых RPG и прочего.


Видеообзор с геймплеем:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUcAzdAYfbY


Кратко, суть игры в следующем:

Вы собираете отряд (стандартно - танк, хилер, дд-шник) и отправляетесь на уничтожение боссов в чужие подземелья\лабиринты.

В то же время, собираете свое подземелье\лабиринт и ждете атак отрядов соперников. Своим лабиринтом и мобами в нем вы не управляете. Собрали данж, и ждете пока совершат рейд на вас, смотрите результат, прокачиваете босса, меняете колоду. 

Да, это же карточная игра, так что у каждого босса и героя есть своя колода, и по мере прокачивания как тех, так и других, появляется все больше опций для декбилдинга. 

Ожидаемо для ККИ, здесь есть бустеры, система довольно стандартная - их можно покупать за золото, можно за денежку, есть квесты и награды за бои.

Кстати, каждый раз, когда ваше подземелье оказывается непроходимым для соперника, вы получаете 10 пыли, из которой можно крафтить карты. Чем чаще вы отправляетесь в рейды на чужие подземелья, тем чаще вражеские рейды приходят к вам (что выгодно).

Мне игра понравилась, интересный концепт в сочетании с ощущением настольной игры или ролевого приключения.

Пока она в раннем доступе, не слишком много контента, на многих картах отсутсвует арт, не все реализовано, но вангую, что на релизе это будет 8-10 из 10. Конечно же, на мой субъективный вкус. 

Спасибо, что дочитали. | Labyrinth just went free to play, although it's still in Early Access, so I figured I'd leave a review for people to see whether or not it's worth their time. 
Short answer: Yes.. 
Long answer: ...Yess
/REVIEW END -Throws smokebomb .. just kidding.

Quick Review:
It's a tactical battle thingy. It's good. It's free. It's like pokemon, except in 3D, you control awesome heroes, and you battle against mythological monsters. So not really like pokemon but you get the idea.

Labyrinth?
Yeah the name doesn't really show up in google that well, and there's no David Bowie, Jennifer Connelly, Goblin King or Bog of Eternal Stench (yet).

Outline:
You do collect cards from pack to use in battles, which work as your passives, minions(for bosses) and abilities. It plays like a tactical battle game. Currently (in Early Access) single battles take place in a single arena based on the boss. There's no limited ""energy"" system and you can play as much as you want. The cards are balanced (some cards are better, others are situationally better) and every hero and boss is unique in some way.

Currently there are 6 heroes and 6 bosses, eventually there will be at least 2 heroes of every class type and 8+ bosses. The heroes of the same class share cards, besides a few guaranteed hero-specific cards, but you can only field one of each class. Every hero and boss gets at least one permanent passive ability, some armor, and some basic, more than decent cards to begin with.

Bosses each have two classes and choose their minions and actions from those classes.
It is a tile based game and some bosses/minions take up more tiles than others, from 1x1 (human sized) bosses all the way up to 3x3 (giant) bosses, and even 3x3 minions. The size of the bosses and minions has a subtle effect on play as well, and  in the current version the battlefield terrain can be altered, with lava or cracks, during battle. The battlefield terrain alteration mostly occurs around one of the bosses, who is a magma beast. He bleeds torrents of lava when hit, and can spew lava around him as an attack.

Heroes get two basic abilitys, guard and an individual weapon, that don't consume a card and can be used for card draw or to save/use resources. The basic abilities can be upgraded with some cards, e.g. warfare heroes can equip better weapons, the mages can equip a spell book.
The basic hero weapons themselves have their own class which can be affected by cards. E.g. the fire mage's fire spells become swifter at focus 10, which includes her base attack.
The rogue engineer heroine's base attack counts as a ""ranged attack"" for perks and abilities that buff and trigger on those.

Bosses don't have a base attack and have a smaller hand then heroes, allowing you some control over better AI performance and making boss combos more likely. Every day there is a quest that offers a sum of gold worth around 8-10 victories, so if you can only play once a day it is still efficient. You can hold 3 quests at a time, and change them each once.


Old Reviews:
There were more positive reviews from key backers, but due to a steam policy change of only allowing direct purchases to post reviews that count, some diminished.
Hopefully now that it is free to play they can be restored.
There was a critical bug that delayed the free to play update, and they fixed it the same day, meaning that free to play was only delayed by a single day.


Is It Pay 2 Win Though?
It doesn't feel like it.
There's no premium only content. Everything is available to F2P, and the epic/legendary rate is quite high, although the coin rate is low (balanced by rate). You can also craft all of the obtainable cards in the game with a currency you earn from defense(your boss) battles and disenchanting duplicates. You can get an early lead on obtained cards by paying sure, but a lot of the fun comes from building up your deck and improving it.

Casual matchmaking is partially based on how well you do, and of course Ranked mode is, so the tougher your deck, the tougher your opponents in general. It also means that if you're not doing well you'll likely be matched up with F2P decks in future anyway.

It's also somewhat balanced in that, all cards are effective in one way or another, and for perks/minions, they have a card cost of which you can only spend so much. In my experience, well constructed F2P decks and smart play should be able to win against decks with higher rarity/more powerful cards. It also doesn't take that long to reach max level, by rough estimate you could collect most of the current cards in a few months by doing the daily quest everyday.

You can quit at any time, or if you get disconnected from the game at any time, and you will be able to return back to the raid you were in the middle of.


Playtime?
By comparison, I have more hours on Labyrinth in a week than on:
	XCOM 2
	Hitman: Absolution (100% achievements)
	Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen
	One Way Heroics
	Hand of Fate
	Cargo Commander
	Dungeon of the Endless
	Risk of Rain


Did I mention it's free to play now?


Please, stop reading, I don't have anything else, I beg you, I'm just a humble fisherperson.

Double-click on a unit to see more about it.
Double-click on own units on timebar to see their hand, so you can plan better.
Arrow keys or both mouse buttons to move around field.
RMB to rotate and wheel to zoom in.
In deck selection, RMB to study a summon from summon spell, or craft/disenchant card.
	Guarding is a good way to draw extra cards, since it only costs 1 tick. It's good for Faith if she draws all Heal cards and doesn't need to heal.
Max handsize = appears to be 7, and when you reach 7, you just stop drawing cards until you use them?
You can scroll the sidebar history in a battle to see moves longer than the previous 8 effects.

That said, I own multiple versions of this game, to include the IRL version. One thing that kind of irks me that this game doesn't do is allow for multiple base sets to be played for a longer game.

Moonlighter es un juego donde controlamos a un comerciante llamado Will el cual dirige una tienda llamada Moonlighter que vende toda clase de productos extraídos de unas extrañas mazmorras que se generan aleatoriamente cada vez que se entra en ellas.

No es el mejor rougelike de acción ni es el mejor juego de comercio, pero mezcla muy bien estos dos conceptos y lo vuelven un juego muy único y divertido.

Además, visualmente es hermoso y tiene muy buena banda sonora.



Más allá de esta premisa, no me gustaría contar mucho más acerca de la historia ya que es mejor descubrirlo por uno mismo.

Pese a que narrativamente suena bastante raro el concepto de que las mazmorras se generen aleatoriamente (osea a nivel jugable es entendible por el genero al que pertenece, pero a nivel de trama pues no tiene mucho sentido), poco a poco se va descubriendo el porque de este extraño suceso.

Es un juego que todo el mundo comienza a jugar por ver que ofrecen las mecánicas, pero todo el mundo lo termina por revelar el misterio de las extrañas mazmorras. Y merece la pena.


Pero lo importante: el juego.

La parte de rougelike de acción es bastante típica dentro de este genero: se generan los niveles de forma aleatoria pero manteniendo patrones que hacen que poco a poco los jugadores se adapten al entorno luchando contra varios tipos de enemigos y recoger las diferentes recompensas que otorgan.

Aquí lo importante será avanzar poco a poco y decidir cuando merece la pena continuar para seguir consiguiendo objetos y cuando es mejor volver a la tienda para asegurar todos los objetos conseguidos durante la run y no arriesgarse a morir y perder el progreso.

Piensa que este es un roguelike progresivo. 
Es decir, que lo importante es asegurar unos objetos para conseguir dinero con el que mejorar tu equipo y así poder derrotar a tus enemigos más fácilmente para llegar cada vez más lejos en la mazmorra hasta poder luchar y finalmente derrotar al jefe final.



¡Pero esto solo es la primera parte del juego! Ahora viene la segunda: el comercio.

Una vez vuelvas a la tienda tienes que vender los objetos para conseguir dinero con el que mejorar tu equipo (y también mejorar la tienda y el pueblo).

Lo que lo hace tan especial es lo siguiente: Tu no sabes el valor de los objetos que obtienes, lo tienes que descubrir mediante la reacción de los clientes:

¿Tu objeto es demasiado caro? El cliente reaccionará enfadado y no comprará el objeto.

¿Tu objeto es demasiado barato? El cliente reaccionará contento y comprará el objeto. De hecho, a veces la reacción será tan positiva que merecerá la pena subir el precio en la próxima venta.

Y en esto consiste el comercio: en buscar el equilibrio para que los clientes estén contentos y siempre quieran comprar, al mismo tiempo que tu siempre obtienes el máximo beneficio posible.



Si os fijáis, tanto el rougelike como el comercio tienen una cosa en común: Tomar decisiones.

No es un juego muy difícil, ni tampoco requiere mucha habilidad, pero si requiere pensar mucho en cada paso que vas a tomar para la siguiente vez que vayas a las mazmorras, puedas avanzar lo máximo posible hasta poder enfrentarte al jefe final de cada mazmorra y poder derrotarlo.









En resumen:

Un rougelike de acción y comercio que mezcla muy bien estos dos conceptos y lo vuelve una experiencia única y muy entretenida.


Moonlighter es uno de estos juegos que no hace nada revolucionario que destaca por encima de otros videojuegos del mismo genero, pero todo lo hace bien y de forma justa y balanceada. Tanto el combate, exploración, gestión comercial y progresión es excelente y dura lo justo para que nunca se sienta aburrido ni repetitivo en ningún momento.

Además, entra muy bien por los ojos por esos hermosos gráficos pixel art, tanto en sus escenarios, como sus animaciones llenas de detalle en el protagonista y los diferentes NPC de la aldea.

¿Y que decir de la banda sonora? Delicia para mis oídos. Además me encanta la música dinámica cuando hablas con los diferentes comerciantes del pueblo y estos tienen su propio tema adaptado a su temática.


Nada más que decir señoría: Juego totalmente recomendado. Imprescindible si te gustan los rougelike y los juegos de comercio.

Was fun at first but constantly bombarded with ads to buy stuff when you hit walls. Not ethical f2p game | It's a fun game to poke at now and then, leave running in the background while you play something else. I won't deny it that.
The artwork that goes into making the characters is beautiful. You can even watch the guy draw on twitch, and I recommend you do, give him some views! 

It also has lore, and fun banter between the characters to read between levels. 
My favourite is Jarlaxle. 

But the games monetization is very egregious. Over 200 quids ""worth"" of DLC and an in game store with loot boxes. 
You can get these in game, which is at least a plus, but it feels like an advertisement, the way they are drip fed to you.
And when I say worth, there's a pack in the game, that comes with an autoclicking raccoon (Trash Panda) and some potions, it says it's 35 quids worth at the cost of 15 quid.
That is not 35 quids worth. Some potions and an admittedly very cute, Raccoon are not worth 35 quid... If you think that, then you're just incorrect. Factually false.

If you're content to leave the game on in the background, that's not a problem. You'll eventually get things that will be left in the background. There's also codes you can enter for free chests, which is nice. A point in the games favour.

But I cannot recommend this game, on the basis that it is so greedy. So many micro-transactions. You can potentially spend hundreds of pounds on a game that you leave on in the background. 

If you are not the kind to fall prey to microtransactions, then yes, by all means, get this game, leave it on in the background, and enjoy. But if you are... then avoid it at all costs! Because this game will ride you hard and take you for everything you've got. | Un univers qu'on apprécie

---致我人生第一次玩的卡牌肉鸽神作《杀戮尖塔》
前几日冬促，购买了《杀戮尖塔》这款游戏，在玩之前心里曾想：我玩过那么多个3A大作，怎能会被一个小小的卡牌游戏震撼呢？看着steam好评如潮的评价，心里抱着不理解和尝试的态度，还是打开了游戏。

没错，我摊牌了，我彻底被这个游戏折服，从买完游戏到现在我无时不刻都在玩，目前也差不多一百小时了，如此优秀的游戏玩法和质量已经能超越很多3A大作。

再玩之前，我也确实久仰杀戮尖塔在卡牌肉鸽当中的地位，但是我也确实从来没玩过卡牌肉鸽，《杀戮尖塔》也属于我在肉鸽类游戏中的白月光了吧。确实只有在实际上手之后才能感受到其中的魅力。从最开始的重开在商店里找好遗物，到现在稍微有些对删牌过卡的理解，这种不完全依赖随机而是能够在游戏局内运营、构筑卡牌的机制正是它的魅力所在。同时四个角色特色迥异，相同角色又因为不同的牌组构筑有着不同的打法，再加上几乎毫无门槛的操作，在roguelike游戏的重开-学习的过程中，低挫败感、高成就感、对卡牌的熟悉以及逐渐对角色的理解使得游戏过程不像通常的卡牌roguelike，而更加有趣，能取舍是否该拿牌、是否该移除卡牌、接下来又该怎么构筑，这使该游戏的可重复游玩性大大增加。


前些天终于用战士，猎人和鸡煲把心脏打通关了，也算是对这游戏有些浅薄的理解了

开始玩这游戏的时候，好哥们建议我先玩鸡煲，说是鸡煲转起来特别强，而我也感受到了。

后来哥们和我说，玩战士得学会烧牌，我很诧异，明明每张牌都是我精挑细选的，为什么要把他们烧掉呢？后面理解了，把效率低的卡烧掉后，留下单卡效率最高的卡，打怪效率更高。之后喜欢上了烧牌的感觉，尤其很喜欢腐化，当把其他牌烧干净后，只剩下那几张攻击牌，颇有种破釜沉舟的感觉，就算打不过再sl嘛，把不该烧的牌留下来。

当我研究战士烧牌的时候，我认为战士是一个最需要想象力的职业，玩的时候得靠想象力。

关于杀戮尖塔的赞美太多太多了，我不想去赞美游戏的本身。我印象最深刻的一局是战士第一次打败心脏，因为卡组不太好，强度不高。我腐化黑拥SL一个小时二十次，结局依旧是输。我相信我能赢，我把29张牌牌序列出来，腐化黑拥烧完不同的牌牌序列出来，一个小时后我终于找到了那个解，最后我赢了之后长舒一口气。在那一刻我赢了游戏，在那一刻也赢了时间。或许一个小时我重开一局选牌好早赢了，可是能赢的局我不愿认输。


即使最后我们都会输给时间，这没关系，那也要谱写出每个人自己生命的赞歌。什么是生命的赞歌？或许是藏在人们骨子里的永不屈服、永不妥协、永不认输。

我的人生没办法sl，为了战胜这一路上的小怪，烧过那么多休息牌，娱乐牌，还换了那么多血，这是否真的值得？可惜这个问题的答案没法通过sl去知道了。
现在的我，就想赶快走到下一个篝火休息。人生啊，总是奔向下一个篝火，区别是以前的我会在篝火敲牌，以后我只会休息了。

最后感谢《杀戮尖塔》给我带来一百小时的快乐时光，我现在唯一后悔的就是在大学期末考试期间购买了这款游戏，这游戏真的有瘾啊！😭 | 又开始带鸡煲节奏了我真是服了😅鸡煲是这个游戏唯一的完美职业，已经和尖塔融为一体，成了尖塔的底层逻辑，成名绝技偏差认知给尖塔带来了这个贴吧最经典的话题，创造了尖塔的黄金时代，诋毁鸡煲，你想毁了杀戮尖塔吗？
 | My first 500 hours in Slay the Spire were hours I didn't pay for. 

I was a kid in highschool, broke, there was only 3 characters in the game, Vine was alive and Tiktok had yet to really get a foothold in the world. It was a better time.

And I... sailed the seas. Its not something I'm ashamed of, and if you are down on your luck, still a kid, or just don't feel like jockeying the Steam refund policy to see if you like a game, most game devs would prefer thats how you play their game over buying a copy of dubious origin from a reseller. 

Why even bring this up, you might ask? Well, it was only last year that I realized how much had gone into the game, and that there was a 4th character that I had no clue even existed. And, against my better judgement with regards to my ever disappearing free time, I picked up STS again to try that 4th character. And then I started playing the other characters too. And then I started ascension runs. 

Never in all my days have I encountered such a well crafted deckbuilder. Being singleplayer, STS doesn't care if you find a combo that breaks the game and makes the enemy unable to interact with you. Slay the Spire doesn't try and limit your ceiling, it dares you to go infinite, it [i] wants [/i] you to go infinite. My favorite part of the game is how it encourages offense while putting more than enough wrinkles in your path that you can't just go full zerg rush. Fully indexing into any one thing without accounting for the counters puts you on the path to losing. 

Learning the Watcher, the illusive 4th character I didn't know existed as it got added after I put my 500 [strike] pirated [/strike] pre-purchase hours in has been one of the most enjoyable deckbuilding experiences I've had since... well since I played STS the first time. 

The main thing I was trying to do on the Watcher that was so fun was going infinite. There was a really interesting play pattern you can take where you reset a lot and chop your deck down to like 3 powers and then your 2 card combo that goes until you win. The fun part is that by taking your deck down to so few cards, any enemy that adds cards to your deck in any way is immediately the most threatening thing you could encounter. You also have to make illogical decisions in order to get to infinite. You skip like 90% of cards you are offered, you make sacrifices for some things that would never make sense in a normal run. And that is just ONE way to play the game on one character, completely ignoring everything that comes with ascension runs. 

And all of that is also completely ignoring everything that isn't purely gameplay. The art is amazing, the soundtrack is amazing, the sound DESIGN is amazing, and there has never been a better time to get into Slay the Spire because there is a sequel that looks like its amping up everything about the first game and giving more of what is undeniably one of the grandpappys of indie roguelikes. That would've been a silly statement 10 years ago, but there are so many indie roguelikes now that it can be hard to stand out among them. 

Slay the Spire has stood the test of time and remains at the top of the tower. Play this game, and if you can, uh, pay for it while you're at it... I did. Eventually.

[code] https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42143664/ [/code] | 仅仅是打了个全成就 ，仍然无法全面的评价这个游戏。因为这100个小时里仅仅专精了猎人，还有三个职业只是简单玩了玩。
真的有点惊叹于游戏的设计，仅仅四个角色，仅仅三个区域（算上心脏四个）却可以让一个游戏有着如此大的可玩性。看似重复的遭遇和地图，随着局内带来的各种惊喜（多种多样的道具，卡组搭配，药水选择，随机事件等）和精妙的设计（数值的平衡和关卡的平衡）可以说再玩几百个小时都不会觉得腻。而且这还是我没去更深体验其他三个角色和增加可玩性的mod时的想法。
体验下来确实可以说无与伦比，极其出色的游戏（又到幸运时刻了，今年出2！） | Dangerous dangerous game, whether you are playing it on the go via tablet or have it on steam maybe with mods as well, if this is the right game for you your free time will evaporate. If you like deckbuilding, pve strategy and the like, this is just perfect.

If you're thinking of ""why bother getting this game when Slay the Spire 2 is going to come out soon?"", well this is already one of the best games of all time, don't be silly."

3 words: Best Game Ever.

This has honestly been the only game that I've truly enjoyed and have never stopped enjoying. Splitgate ruined other games for me because of how perfect it is in my eyes. Whenever I'd take a short break or play other games with friends, I wouldn't be able to keep my mind off of Splitgate. It has a small but extremely nice and tightly knit community that will support you and one of the best dev teams I've ever seen. They actively play the game, CardinalSoldier, the CEO of 1047 games, competes in top level pro play, something I've never seen with other games. They also actively listen to the entire playerbase and allow you to voice your concerns. They are also extremely hard working and put in an immense amount of effort to make the game as enjoyable as possible for everyone. While the playerbase is currently small, I have no doubt that it will grow in the near future, especially with things like a console port coming soon, along with cross-platform. The game is also free to play which means there is no consequences to at least trying it out, so I recommend that anyone who enjoys a shooter game try it out. 

If you love competitive play, this game is built for you. What I love about this game, and one of the reasons I hate battle royals, is the impact of RNG (randomness). There is (almost) zero rng in this game. Most of the weapons are hitscan and there is no random drops for weapons on this map, meaning the competitiveness of this game focuses 100% on skill. Talking about skill, this game has one of the highest skill ceilings I've seen. Just like building in Fortnite, the portal aspect of this game is a easy to learn mechanic but extremely difficult to master.

Something I've seen talked a lot about in reviews (mostly negative ones) are the maps. When first introduced to new players, the maps may seem weak and poorly made, however once you learn the portal mechanic more and understand the playstyle of the game, the maps become the most interesting and forever evolving parts of the game. To this day I'm still learning new portal peaks throughout the maps!

The guns may feel unbalanced, but imo they are really well balanced and perfectly suited for this game. I honestly have a bit of trouble trying to think of what needs to be changed with the weapons right now to make the game better. Obviously, some weapons are extremely more powerful than others, but that's the entire point. Yeah, there's a shotgun that can one tap people and has 6 rounds, but it also only comes up every 2 minutes, and is something you have to work for to get (winning gunfights). The Carbine is also my favorite gun in any game. Not because it is overpowered, but because of how perfectly balanced it is. The gun is 100% skill based. There is no other mechanic that makes the Carbine work better or worse, if you're an absolute amazing shot, you're going to destroy people with it. If not, it's going to be more difficult, yet still possible, to use.

All in all, the game is free and I highly recommend you checking out this game. From the bottom of my heart, I believe this is one of the best games ever created and will get the recognition it deserves in the future. If you do check it out, make sure to put some time into to really learn the mechanics of it and you'll fall in love with it just as I have.



Old review from a very long time ago:

I think that the reviews on this steam page are not doing the game justice. EDIT: (It seems like the reviews are now mostly positive which accurately reflects this game!) This is a very fun, high paced game that can be very annoying at times but I feel like the people who are not recommending it are just saying no because they didn't know how to play the game. If you take the time to learn how to use the portal's effectively the game can feel very rewarding. I really recommend this for people who enjoy FPS or people who enjoyed halo.

The maps are a little troublesome but I feel like when you understand where all the portals can go you can really get some amazing and rewarding flanks.

The weapons are a little wonky because the pistol is very powerful  relative to the Assault Rifle. If you hit all body shots with AR it takes around 15 bullets to kill but with a pistol its around 6. The shotgun and Rocket launcher can also be annoying at times.

I find this game very fun to play and I enjoy the challenge of becoming a better player. If you have good aim or would like to work on this, this game really requires you to have good aim. You should get it (it's free) and play at least 5 hours to get a feel for the game before you fully judge it. It may be hard at the start but eventually it becomes really fun.

Edit: 
I still love this game and hope it grows. For now it seems to have slowly dipped down. I really hate to see this because it's honestly one of my favorite games. I still have hope in my heart that this game is successful. | A 4-man Dev team created a better game than most multi-thousand dev teams including Activision. Kudos to them for getting all of the servers up and running smooth in a couple weeks of a beta. Definitely worth a try if you're a have of Halo or Portal. | Hit reg can be questionable at times but otherwise a real good time.  Brings back the level of adjustment for private matches not seen since the old school arena FPS days like speed, gravity, health, and other mutators. | Amazing Game!! Que times are not great right now do to the overwhelming number of players trying to get in but hey its a beta. The devs are amazing. Highly recommend for anyone to download and give it a try. | Okay. I really don't know why this game is slept on. I'll save the gimmik of the game for last. First of all, if you enjoy Halo and want something that feels fresh this game is for you hands down. And if you aren't a fan of halo this game still has plenty to offer which I will go into. The time to kill is refreshing. It's not instant 4 shots your dead, it leaves room for actual battling and skill. Most weapons require a good amount of accuracy but are in the perfect inbetween for the ttk. Weapons that are slow firing that require you to land shots accurately have instakill potential but only for those who have the skill to line shots up properly. If it's an instakill no matter what it requires charge up time, if it doesn't have charge up time it needs to be a headshot, if it's not a headshot you need to be up close with a shot gun. Everything has it's strengths and weakness and you hardly feel cheated. The movement is smooth with quick transitions from sprinting to aiming, you are given jet packs for verticle mobility, and portals open up endless possibilities. The game modes consist of your fps standards as well as a few extra that are very fun and creative. And if that isn't enough, you can always spice things up a bit with custom games allowing you to customize rules on game modes for friends and strangers alike to enjoy with you. The casual playlist actually seems casual and allows new players to learn the ropes and actually enjoy themselves while learning the ropes. And the competitive scene has the challenging edge experienced players would desire. On top of this there is a theater mode as well which allows you to view your best, funniest, and most questionable moments in the game. And with all that out of the way we can finally talk about portals. This mechanic is fantastic. You can use them to cross maps quickly, flank enemies, open corners to shoot around, escapes, the whole nine yards. Jump off a ledge and put a portal beneath you and place the other end cross map. Use that momentum to send yourself high in the sky and jetpack across the map to the some high ledge you couldn't reach before. It's fast and gives the game a whole other dynamic to explore and get creative with. And if none of my review sold you on this game, it's free. So there's no loss if you don't enjoy it."
76561198082086866,323580,Jotun: Valhalla Edition,0.0,"Action, Adventure, Indie",0,"TLDR: This is a good exploration game, that features 6 major boss fights. It's not terribly long, and it's chill apart from having to deal with a some clunky features in the battle system.

I enjoy this game- it's relatively chill, up until you hit the different area bosses. You can complete each area in any order, so if you want to farm all the health and ability upgrades before doing the bosses, you can. The levels are neat, with some lore spread throughout. The music and voice over are really good, and I appreciate that they decided to record the dialogue in Icelandic. The art is interesting, and I appreciate that they tried to do something unique with it- it really shines with the bosses and creatures, and some of the environments are genuinely lovely. The boss fights are fun, and the the patterns are well telegraphed- I really enjoyed the Ice Jotun, and the Sky Jotun. That doesn't keep it from being frustrating though at times. 

Your character moves slow, the arena maps are large, and the giants have long steps (as they would be expected to have). You spend a lot of time chasing the giants around the arena, for a few hits, before they move again. The god abilities are frustrating to use, as they're on a bar that you cycle through. It's distracting to go from one ability to the next, and you have to watch what ability you have selected, which draws your attention away from the boss. It's easy to overshoot the ability you want, and you can't rearrange the skills to make it easier to get to the skills you need quickly. The selection does cycle from the end , back to the beginning, but that just once again means you sometimes roll past the thing you need. It would have felt more smooth to be able to assign the abilities to key/button presses in order to make better use of muscle memory, and it's hard not to feel like a fair number of deaths are because of this clunky feature. I would use all the abilities more often, if I didn't feel like I had to be on the most helpful skills, all the time, just in case.
I've gotten Odin down to 20% of his health a few times now, and am not sure I will complete the game due to this. I may just youtube the end of the game instead, but it was still enjoyable to try the game overall.

I will say for completionists, there is one persistent bug for the Northern Sky map which does not register you collecting the Mimir check point. This bug has been in the game since at least mid 2023, and hasn't been fixed. In order to get the achievement for completion, you need to change the game file to an older build through steam, and collect it using that version of the game.
Go to ""Properties -> Betas"" and in the ""Beta participation"" drop down menu select ""oldversion - oldversion""; the save files are apparently compatible. | This game is SO SLOW.I would walk, and it would be like 10 seconds to just get across one screen in a whole area. Want to do a heavy attack? Try waiting 3 full seconds for it to strike. Want to hit a boss? You'll walk up to it in 3 seconds, and then it'll slowly pull away, making it impossible to hit, and it'll take another 5 seconds to continue walking until you can hit it.
I found the abilities to be quite useless. I only used the healing, which by the end only recovers about 1/3 of your health (with 3 uses, you can roughly fill your health bar all the way back up once), and Mjolnir, which basically shaved off a few hits during boss battles (and since each attack sequence took anywhere between 10 and 30 seconds, it was a big time-saver). But because it only worked with heavy attacks, you had to basically be on top of it where you could trigger it AND get a heavy swing in before the boss moved again, which was very rare. I don't recall wasting so many limited-use abilities as I did in this game. And I tried triggering the other abilities, which mostly didn't really do anything useful. The shield, for example—if you needed it, you were probably dead, anyway.
For some reason, I wanted to be able to recommend this game because I'm a softie for pretty indie games with worlds that bring to life cultures and myths. But, man, it was almost like they didn't respect my time with this game. I wouldn't mind walking far distances if it was scenic or I felt like things were far away, but sometimes I'd walk for a minute or two only to be staring at my character moving slowly across a nearly blank screen the whole time. | Sevmedim ilk 30 dakikada bana devam ettirme isteği oluşturacak hiç bir şey vermedi.

There are actually a ton of cool and amazing ideas here, and a fun theme with intriguing art. Unfortunately actually playing this game is not very fun. The UI gets in the way of itself.

And it is difficult to know what units still have movement options, or even what they do.

There are 5 nodes. As agents, you must secure 3 and as hackers, you must hack 3, in order to win.
Each round consists of a talking period, which is the main one, where you chat with other players in-game:
- as an agent, you try and convince other players to trust that you're an agent and try to weed out the hackers;
- as a hacker, you know who your other team-mates are, and try to trick agents into thinking that you're clean.
Each player, in turn, selects a certain amount of people to go on a mission at the end of each round.
As a hacker, you want to have hackers selected, so they can hack the node of that round (you can also bluff, so people think you're clean) and as an agent, you want to select only agents, so that there's no chance of nodes being hacked.
You must use your wits in order to weed out the hackers, as an agent, or fool the agents into thinking you or the other hackers are clean, so that you can hack the nodes.
It's very fun and I recommend it. | A game where I have to lie to win. And I get to screw over random people on the internet and laugh at them when they fail. And my identity is hidden in public lobbies.

Sign me up! | Nice. always been a fan of strategy games, and parlor games like Mafia, Werewolves, and 'Secret Dictator' as another game is referred to, but hard to scrape together a bunch of people for just a few rounds, without having to feed them all. this is a great form factor, enjoyable, easy to pick up after a round or two, nice UI, great graphics, love the sound and atmosphere. Don't trust those rascally hackers! Great community as well, active and nice to chat with! | Psychological warfare doled out in chunks you can fit into a lunch break.

MINDNIGHT is an absolutely incredible game, and it looks like it'll only get better with time. The developers are active and open to feedback and suggestions, the playerbase is currently small but will grow with time, and the community is wonderful.

The game is simple to get into. Unlike some of the more complex variations of games like Mafia, there are only two roles: Agents, who comprise the majority of players, and Hackers, who form the minority. Agents aren't aware of who their teammates are, but hackers are. Teams of variable size are proposed to go on missions, with Agents wanting to secure the mission node, and Hackers wanting to hack it. Hackers do not have to hack the node, however, they can choose to secure it just like an Agent. Also a welcomed departure from more Mafia-esque games is that there is no system where players are eliminated from the game. Everybody plays the entire round, no getting assassinated at the beginning of the game and having to sit back and watch the rest passively due to bad luck.

The various game elements combine to form a game centered around the mind, appropriately. Records of who went on what mission as well as who voted for what teams help provide a look at who you can trust and who you can't, but the best Hackers will seek to blend in with the Agents while sowing doubt. Pure logic won't take you all the way, you need to engage.

But enough rambling. The game is quite fairly priced, has an active and growing community, the potential for even more styles of gameplay coming in the future, and is devastatingly fun. Stop by the discord channel to say hi if you'd like to learn more, and I hope to see you soon in MINDNIGHT! | This game is one of the best deceiving games there are, especially that it's free to play.

However, if the new DEV team sticks with it, it will continue to grow. It's just a matter of continuing to push updates out and improving the engine (eventually at least to Unreal 4). The fact that people mistake this for Fortnite, constantly, because they would have looked the same in a year long past now, means it's popular enough to even be referenced against. Hitboxes are HUGE. The game allows you to be 'bad' but still be an okay player.

Crossplay is the only way to go right now as if you don't, you may not find a lobby to play in. Peak hours of filled lobbies seem to be between Noon CST till around 7pm. That's way better than how it was where it seemed 'dead' all the time.

IMO there's a LOT that still needs to be done. The former 'pros' still destroy people and if they continue to campy camp newer or just plain NEW players to this game, they'll not want to come back. Only way to really fix that is SBMM or add different modes like specifically ranked for the pros that want to fight others on their level and/or public type lobbies (like many other BR's have). I know that's probably way down the road, but it's going to have to happen to draw the players that can only play a couple hours a night because of their busy lives (aka casuals).

They've put some work into the new skins. New Battle Pass with this last update in November. New class, or rather a class brought back from Alpha. Rumors of another new class down the line. Ultimately people just have to have an interest in this game and there are a few creators that play this game that are IN FACT promoting the crap out of it. All in all, it's a fun little BR to get away from the others that are more 'serious' IMO.

[b]Katamari Damacy REROLL[/b] is a port of the classic roll-em-up game for the [b]PS2[/b]. This is the very first time I have played the game, and it’s weird. However, I enjoyed it very much because of its fun and quirky gameplay. Rolling a small ball to an even bigger ball to make it even bigger seems simple on paper, but I oddly enjoyed it, as having the ability to pick up almost anything is quite fun.

[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]

[*]Fun and quirky story with whimsical characters
[*]Very fun gameplay that can be enjoyed by all
[*]A fantastic soundtrack
[*]Beautiful HD visuals that make the world very colorful

[*]The controls are a little rough and clunky when starting out

[h1]Story[/h1]
The story starts with [b]The King of All Cosmos[/b] who I think could easily pass off as a [b]Burger King Mascot[/b], accidentally destroys all the stars in the solar system. Because of this, he decides to send his son the [b]Prince[/b] to create stars for the galaxy because that’s too much for a king. There is also a subplot of a family of four, but the game doesn’t want you to focus on that or anything with the story.

I honestly feel that the developer's intention was not to focus on the story, which is why it’s not too complicated or in-depth. Which is completely fine sometimes, I do like playing a nice, relaxing, and casual game. To them, fun came first and I do think the story for this game is fun, The [b]King of The All Cosmos[/b] steals the show for this though. I just love this guy's attitude despite it coming across him just being a jerk but I feel that there would be no game or reward for going through all the levels.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3422535978
[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
[b]Katamari Damacy REROLL[/b] tasks the player to roll a [b]Katamari[/b] into smaller objects to make an even bigger object. For you to then be able to roll over even bigger objects to make the [b]Katamari[/b] even bigger, and so forth. Certain levels will have a certain size that the [b]Katamari[/b] needs to be to beat it, however, if you get the [b]Katamari[/b] to the right size before the timer is up. You can still keep rolling to make it bigger and this will add to your overall total score for that level.

When your [b]Katamari[/b] crashes into an object it can’t pick up, it will bounce off that object if enough damage is done, certain objects will fall off. You can pick them up again, but some will try to run away from you. When humans get off, they suddenly get the ability to clip through walls and objects, making them impossible to pick up again. There is also a minor issue, which is that sometimes your [b]Katamri[/b] can’t fit through certain gates because it’s too big, but you aren’t at a good enough weight to pick that gate up. Resulting in some of the objects you picked up bouncing off and ruining your hard work.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3422536170
However, if I am going to talk about the gameplay, I should at least go over the major elephant in the room: the controls. They are a little rough and clunky when you are starting the game out, and they were the reason I almost stopped playing the game altogether. I am also going to say right off the bat that playing the game on a controller is best. Moving the file select screen, I do with my keyboard, there is a simple control option but that is the worst option you can enable. This is because you can’t move the camera while in the simple control scheme, so the normal one is your best option. So I had to get used to playing the game on the default controls, and then suddenly, it just clicked with me and I started to like them. The game works control-wise, it’s just getting a feel for them may take some time.

The gameplay is very simple, and I think really anyone can pick up and play this game once they get used to it. Also, there is a lot of stuff for you to pick up in this game, objects you would never expect to pick up can be. And when I say there is stuff to pick up, trash is everywhere, and some people are doing the most random of things. The game has a nice, fun, quirky humor that I enjoyed very much. There are also hidden secrets you can find in the levels as well these are cosmetics for the [b]Prince[/b].

However, I should warn you that some of the levels have timers. If the timer runs out, it’s game over, and you have to redo the level. There are some levels that don’t require a time limit, rather they ask you to pick up a certain object. But the point of those levels is that they have that said object scattered and you either pick up a certain number or avoid that said object so you don’t be the level too early and get a low score. I did like how the devs made the levels as sometimes it made you do things outside the box instead of just rolling a bigger ball.

There is one thing I would like to address is that this game is pretty short. It only has like ten levels with a few optional ones with it. As much as I would like there to be more levels, the game would eventually overstay its welcome and the only thing they could really do is make the [b]Katamari[/b] bigger. So at the end of the day, I am glad that this game is short, the sequel is out on [b]Steam[/b] though so if you want more [b]Katamari Damacy[/b] fun, it’s there.

[h1]Graphics and Performance[/h1]
[b]Katamari Damacy REROLL[/b] has very colorful graphics, and the art style is very nice. The colors match the world you are exploring. I tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM. I experienced no issues while playing, and the game ran very well.

The soundtrack is also just outright fantastic. I loved every single song, but my favorite has to be [b]LONELY ROLLING STAR[/b].

However, there is a small issue with the fact that you can’t change any of the game settings until you beat the tutorial level. This may not look like an issue at first glance, but the game is extremely loud when starting up I am used to having games be loud, but this takes the issue to a whole new level. I don’t care if the game starts in window mode, I just want to fix the volume for the game because of how loud it can get.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
[b]Katamari Damacy REROLL[/b] is a fantastic and fun casual game that I actually think almost anyone can really enjoy if they are looking for a simple yet fun game. Of course, there is the issue with the controls, but if you can find a way to get used to them, then this game is honestly a treat. I would maybe wait for a sale as I do think paying 39.99 for about four hours of content is a bit much, but if you are looking for some casual fun or are a fan of the series. Then I think picking the game up at full price is also fine. | Rolling up the world ended up being a pure expression of imaginative fun. The rolling controls for the camera are for me awkward, but the game ended up being a enjoyable form of easy. I was always happy to find the time to play this. | Discovered the game thanks to a youtuber who used a song on his streams, no longer watch the guy, but great game tho | Easier (though in only a few levels) than the original, and with Japanese voice acting and sound design only (the BGM track Wanda Wanda does not play outside of the multiplayer results). The english localization of this version has a few minor glitches that were never fixed post-release.

Definitely recommend, especially if you're playing it in the original Japanese, even on an xbox controller. With all its tiny text, this is a game that massively benefited from the upscaling and increased draw distance allowed by the improved hardware, though not everything is running at your monitor's refresh rate, regardless of what your FPS counter says. Don't be one of those chumps who plays an analog-stick game on keyboard. If your controls feel off regardless, you probably accidentally switched to the new control scheme or vice versa.

If you are unfamiliar with Katamari Damacy, then buy this and familiarize yourself with it. Culture is important. And don't be surprised if the whole world turns out looking exactly like Japan - the entire game is variants on the same 3 levels. | This game is just too janky to earn my admiration. You can beat this game with your eyes closed, so there is an extremely low floor for completion. I feel the camera is too zoomed in, proportions just don't seem right, and tapping any wall will cause you to explode everywhere."

      [h1] 先说结论[/h1]
      [b]怪物猎人：世界对于绝大多数动作游戏玩家来说是不可多得的神作，喜欢通过游戏社交的朋友也可以尝试这款游戏。这款游戏的动作设计，玩法和打击感放到现在也是一流水准。某种意义上来说，怪猎也是一种慢热的游戏，新猎人可能会感觉武器使用起来有些别扭从而感到不适应，而稍微熟练一些后便能get到每个武器的爽点，而且14种武器也能为游戏提供极高的复玩性。本作的难度因人而异，前期较为轻松休闲，后期的难怪可以适当信号弹处理，但还是推荐先自己尝试。作为一个半开放世界游戏，本作的探索要素也会给玩家带来不少惊喜。但新猎人难免会被世界警察啥的恶心到，学会如何处理意外情况也是成为老猎人的必修课。 [/b]

      最初接触到这款游戏是在大一，我为数不多的好友说隔壁怪猎四排缺人，我一看她拿着个太刀在队里如同小鸡啄米觉得挺乐便趁着打折直接购入了本体加冰原。队里仨太刀一轻弩，我是那个轻弩，看着一堆太刀虾开刃空登然后红温猫车，而我在旁边作为远程慢悠悠的输出，一把把打下来也挺有意思。但是怪猎的联机机制要求进入房间的队员主线进度必须高于房主，我们为了进房主的房间必须要往后推进度，最鸽的那家伙理所应当胜任房主，但由于鸽子的本性导致他落后了进度太多，四个人的小队不可能每个人都等她，有人选择往前走，一走就走到了路的尽头。毕业了，玩的也就少了。四人小队连本体都没打完，当初创的群也对怪猎只字不提了。我自己扛着没插珠子的轻弩往前推，被白色大粪冰牙龙锤成了傻子。当时用的电脑内存就1T，为了清内存就把怪猎给卸载了。
      大二刚开学偶然刷到了怪猎的视频，想起来之前的一点小遗憾，于是又把怪猎下了回来，以前的机制忘个差不多了，打算新开个存档。怪猎毕竟是共斗动作游戏，也可能是因为电子游戏本就是我为数不多的社交方式，我打算找个人开坑。我的朋友不多，但好在当时还都有联系。我喊的那个朋友在国外上大学，和我一个高中复读一年高考还是惨不忍睹，但他FPS玩的很好。他刚开始是拒绝的，走出他的FPS舒适圈并不容易，但在我的软磨硬泡加免费赠送下，他还是同意了入坑。这一次我选择了弓箭，而他选择了长枪。我问他玩这玩意干嘛笨的要死使用率还倒一，他问我玩什么B弓箭滑来滑去一碰就死；我回他弓箭垫步如风伤害爆炸，一滑一射飘逸潇洒。他回我长枪不动如山安如磐石，大盾一架啥都不怕。我本身是个特别喜欢打游戏的人，平时都是我喊他上号。然后我喊他帮我刷乱七八糟的属性弓，然后我帮他刷那个滚来滚去的爆锤龙就为了他的那个B防御性能。突然有一天，他说他的朋友也想玩怪猎，喊他开坑，我问他们几个人他说四个人正好。从那以后，我们一起打猎的次数便越来越少了。不过为了我们还能一起打，我还是在坚持跟者他们的进度往下推主线。为了不被他们甩下太远，我当时通宵只为研究一个粪怪。然而我还是有点累了，后面的故事很无聊，我失去了半个朋友。但至少，我没有放弃这个存档，我拿着我的弓杀死了黑龙。
        第一次杀死黑龙是在一个星星很亮的深夜，天很黑，没有太阳，月亮也不是圆的，所以我没剥出来邪眼。任务成功的画面似乎比平时更亮，结算的小曲似乎比往日更加激昂。我似乎出现了玩弓箭的走马灯，没打出来煌黑龙炸膛导致被秒的场景历历在目，被激昂金狮子一炮轰死的一幕犹在眼前。当然比这跟过分的事情还有很多，弓箭玩家要记住如果不插保命类的珠子，满血的你就犹如风中残烛。当时的我想了很多，但现在忘了一部分了哈哈，作为我为数不多的成功经验，我兴奋的把细节记在我的备忘录上[spoiler]（要不然我真的会忘）[/spoiler]，然后把通关的截屏发到了群里，没有人理我，因为当时已经是凌晨了，在第二天早上我才看见别人的祝福和膜拜。在帮了帮别人打的信号弹后，我很长一段时间没碰怪猎，但我已经成为了怪猎的粉丝群体。
        大三的寒假，又开始玩起来了，顺便把三百多的荒野直接预购了，新开的存档打算用太刀再玩一遍。太刀手感和打击感确实很好，红刃登龙也很爽，算是知道很多人为什么喜欢太刀了。大学里的舍友突然也玩起怪猎了，我打算再创一个存档。但是怪猎只给三个存档位，我便删掉了轻弩的那个存档，我也很不舍得我的存档，但我深知放手的重要性。结果我那舍友玩一会不玩了，我屮。不打算开新档了，荒野再说。[spoiler]开了这么多档，最后一直陪着我的，只有我的无聊和猫。[/spoiler][/code] | O jogo é excelente, faz muita diferença na vida esvaziar a raiva em um animal inocente que estava apenas vivendo a vida na natureza vendo um bípede pelado carregando uma marreta com o peso análogo a um uno 97 com os restos da sua raça e do seu predador. o único problema é o grind excessivo pra build perfeita | 作为一名从2020年开始接触怪猎世界的玩家，我与这款游戏的缘分始于大学时期。当时，我有幸加入了一个热爱怪猎的社团，结识了一群志同道合的小伙伴。然而，由于选择了操作难度较高的盾斧，我曾一度被劝退，直到四年后才重新拾起这款游戏。遗憾的是，我未能与当时的伙伴们一起继续游玩。
荒野在即，我的世界之旅，也快要将近尾声了，在这一千小时的游玩中，具体以我的感受进行对这个游戏的总结吧。
——————分割线——————
缺点：极差的新手指引，游戏整体节奏极其慢热，对于一个萌新来说，学习武器的难度极高，需要花费大量的时间摸索学习，学习各种怪猎知识最好的地方在各种社区（视频平台、贴吧、NGA、群交流等）而不是游戏内的引导。联机极其不稳定，极大程度影响了共斗体验。游戏的社交系统存在诸多问题，只能通过steam好友以及集会号码参与集会，游戏内置的公会名片除了能看玩家的数据外名存实亡，联机机制还要求进入房间的队员主线进度必须高于房主。各种超级肝的材料和内容包括不仅限于珠子、皇金武器、冥赤龙武器、聚魔之地客制化材料、道具资源、稀有环境生物、大小金怪物。主线剧情较为薄弱。各种不得不品的生态以及TGY，游戏内不泛十分粪的游戏内容。
——————分割线——————
优点：游戏的画面和动作设计非常优秀，无论是怪物的建模还是角色的动作，都极具质感。 多样化的装备和技能词条设计，使得玩家可以根据不同的战斗场景和怪物特点，搭配出适合自己的装备和技能组合，极大地增加了游戏的策略性和可玩性。更多的互动空间（动作姿势、文本、互动道具）。优秀的怪物设计以及ai，使得怪物各有特点和独特的机制。更开放的多元式狩猎选择，包括但不仅限于技术、生态环境、地盘争夺、逃课玩法、信号弹、多样的武器选择等，救援系统的存在提供给新老玩家更多的游戏选择。丰富的社区资源（功能性mod和外观mod以及额外游戏内容mod等）。卡普空持续更新与支持，超多游戏内容，即使1000h也未能将游戏玩透。
——————分割线——————
在我游戏的开荒过程中，我曾为了刷风飘龙尾巴感到十分无助，于是，我发起了救援信号，摇来了位天尊，不求回报的重复进任务进我的集会帮我肝素材，最后也只是留下了一张名片。
我救援过数不胜数的xdx，有救援完了零交流零互动的，成了其黑奴工具人的；也有很多连游戏麦克风都不知道关，隔着屏幕的一声声尊尊好帅（真是一群可爱的人）；也有同水平，加了游戏好友一起奋斗进步技术一起成长一起并肩作战的aibo。
也是呼吁各位发求助信号的各位玩家：务必与进行援救的天尊进行交流，哪怕只是一张表情，任务结束发一句谢谢，给予一点点反馈。那些担心开救援被压力的玩家，只要你礼貌的进行沟通，ldx们其实都是很友善的，只要你主动，就会有故事。
玩怪猎确实需要一些技术和不断学习的，摇来的天尊让你更快获得所需要的资源，也可以在你遇到过不去的坎的时候帮你，也可以教授一些关于游戏内容的知识，但是希望各位新人不要过于依赖天尊，毕竟在游戏里，你才是苍蓝星，如果一离开天尊，连个普通的大师/上位古龙都没法单人完成，那么这些本应由苍蓝星完成的挑战，就失去了意义。变强从来都不是一蹴而就的，一次次的任务重置和失败才是成长的足迹。可能有人认为，我玩个游戏罢了，这么努力干嘛，这样的人永远也体会不到在一次次狩猎中变强的乐趣，这是你一直抱着大腿体验不到的。别怕失败，大不了，重头来过。
天尊们也有自己的游戏体验和生活，不可能永远跟你绑在一起玩，在这里也希望各位玩家可以成长为真正的《指引前路的苍蓝星》，找到那位可以《与心爱的你行至世界尽头》的人。
Ps：上面这句话的中译中：希望各位苍蓝星可以指引那些深处黑暗中的萌新玩家，在这些过程中找到志同道合的朋友或者是属于你的xdx，如同黑龙套的技能词条那样《继承》《超越》，将苍蓝星的传说延续下去。

76561198082086866,835570,Conqueror's Blade,0.0,"Action, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Strategy, Free To Play",0,"Well lets be honest here this game could have been amazing but of course the community doesn't help with things, we will get into all that later in the review.

For now lets go over the Pros and Cons.

Pros:
- Gameplay is very addicting and fun
- Lots of units, even with most being worthless
- Open world, even with it too being worthless
- Quite a few classes, of course most must be nerfed to the ground

Cons:
- The community
- Competitive aspect played through discord
- Pay to win has been involved for many years now, even with people thinking it hasn't
- Meta units and classes, if everyone uses the same units and classes whats the point?
- They glitched the glamour system for many, including me that removes your beards on your glamours, causing you to look far different with your glamours you invested thousands in

So lets get into the community first, everyone knows with these games theres always people that know best, or want people to play how they want you to play, example if they rush in and die in a simple casual mode they will rage, cry and whine the entire match, they can have seven to eight deaths and sit there spending literally half the game time on respawn timer crying about their team, this becomes personal and people will hold grudges, just from simple casual matches.. so then it goes into the next and if they get on a team they will always cause further issues, to the point they violate the rules over and over. 

Now put this into play with competitive, people can ruin peoples entire seasons just with being babies or accepting toxic groups of players into their guilds, as the community is so small you simply cannot escape these issues and its repeated literally every season.

Casual is fun at times, just block things out, but overall if you play competitive, the game is literally hand in hand with Discord, I would honestly go as far to say serious guilds spend more time on discord dictating who gets whats, how things will go, what will happen and so on each season, ruining the entire aspect of competitive gaming. You can try to play a season but guilds will merge, hop skip jump around, toxic people accepted, toxic groups accepted, they cause issues, jump to the next and rinse and repeat each season forming this disgusting pattern that literally ruins the desire. Why people would want to reward this system is beyond my understanding.

Glamour system is amazing - well use to be until they caused glitches within their own system by adding a ""New tab and Old tab"" for customizing your charc, You want to mix and match attires to look your best most times, so you equip stuff and boom over 90% of your attires helmet no longer work because they change your face to some androgynous looking disgusting model. This system of course is to much for them to care about just keep spending money okay? They will add new models with crappy beards and other junk, spend more and more it will be fine. 

Overall this game was one of my favorites for years, we've been here since the start but now days its not even fun in the slightest, I would recommend it to people if they wanted to just play it every now and again, not getting involved with anyone or any guild. Other than that, stay away. Far away.

3/10 | muy buen juego el balanceo entre las clases es buena y aun mejores graficos se ve estupendo y sobre la nueva temporada no hay palabras un 10.

One of the all time favorites growing up, brought back such fond memories.
If only all remake's were done like this one.
10/10 | I love Spyro, it's my favorite childhood game. But on the PC it's filled with so many problems. To list a few, you can't play it with high FPS because you can't walk, jump, or do anything. I've had my game wiped on riptos rage twice and others are having the game crash. These things should be easily fixed by the Devs but it's been left neglected. I can't recommend this game in the state. | I only ever played the original Spyro games for about 20 minutes as a kid, so I don't think this is just nostalgia talking: it's still a solid platformer from the classic era of 3-D platformers, maybe not the best series of them but still loads of fun. The game mechanics are fairly simple (jump, charge and flame, with the occasional power-up), but it keeps its fun over 3 games. The remake plays pretty smooth (one crash, one getting stuck in a wall in 30+ hours).

The game is easy to play and beat but has some difficulty spikes, particularly with some of the mini-games. The games, especially the third one, suffered from the era's need to include every type of popular game as a mini-game. If I wanted to skateboard I'd go play Tony Hawk! *old man shouts at clouds* | Unfortunately, I cannot finish the game because the camera keeps malfunctioning and pointing in arbitrary directions.

Fist of Awesome is a fun game but got kinda boring fast for me. It just didn't have much going for it besides the punching bears bit. The game isn't that long, a single playthrough can be done in one sitting. This isn't surprising as the game was originally a mobile (and Ouya) game. It's a very simplified version of a game like Streets of Rage with regenerating health and no pick-up items. You level up as you play and unlock stat points to powerup your Health, Power, Speed and Special. The Arena mode looks to be a survival mode where you get to play as any character in the game that you've faced off against and other special characters. It doesn't add much enjoyment to the game sadly. Overall the game is horribly repetitive and offers little to no ""replayability.""

You also fight velociraptors and deer alongside bears. I like the final choice, didn't see it coming.

I'd recommend this game as a casual beat-em-up to play when you want a quick game. Although at full price it's not worth it really, but if you can get it at a discount it's a decent buy.

For the regular price of $7.99 or even the current sale price of $6.79 it isn't that good of a deal.
You can find the game cheaper on mobile platforms: $3.99 on iTunes and the Play Store and $1.99 on the android Amazon Store | Инди имеет свои плюсы и минусы. В игре не было замечено каких-либо багов, пиксельная графика довольно приятна.
Игра получилась довольно разнообразна на идеи и одноверменно нудновата в исполнении.

Каждый уровень уникален по дизайну декораций, делится на 3-4 волны мобов, а затем босс.
Видов мобов показалось маловато, практически все они делятся на:
1) слабых медведей(от уровня к уровню меняющих вид и кол-во хп)
2) слабых оленей (не меняются, появляются редко)
3) сильных оленей (не меняются, встретил на паре уровней)
4) динозавров (на одном уровне)
5) боссов - медведей. (меняются внешне, на каждом уровне)

Практически все удары которые присутствуют - носят чисто косметический характер, посмотреть какими приемами дровосек может лупить зверей. На деле у меня свелось к прокачке супер кулака, которым я лупил всех и ударом в прыжке, чтобы выбраться из заварушки(жизней он почти не отнимает). Определенно стоило сделать остальные удары намного сильнее, чтобы использовать их в комбинациях.

Очень порадовало, что чекпоинты позволяют восстанавливаться практически на месте смерти. Если бы пришлось начинать уровень с начала, думаю бросил бы на 2-3 уровне.

В игре присутствует немного юмора и сюжет, который довольно незамысловат, без этих вешей я бы бросил игру.
В общем, игра была пройдена за полтора часа, но особенных впечатлений я не получил.
Наверное, к этой игре было бы меньше ожиданий, если играть в нее на телефоне, но на компьютере хотелось чего-то большего.

6/10 | + Retro graphics aren't the best graphics out there, but get the job done (a little bit more detail would've been great)
+ Silly humor
+ Regenerating health system works very well

- Upgrades didn't seem to have any effect, or not enough to be really noticeable
- Getting stuck between 2 attacking enemies can get you killed because the game doesn't let you react quickly enough
- Not enough variety in enemy design and attacks, feels like a chore halfway through the game when enemies have bigger healthbars
- Way too short
- Bossfights can't be called bossfights, they're just larger enemies with more health

[Rating: 59/100] | I received a coupon for 50% and decided to give it a try. At first glance the game is pretty well built ( By this I mean it runs with absolutely no problems and have not experienced any lag issues at all ). I also was entertained by the game play for about 5-10 minutes and then grew bored of the combat system. The game seems kind of empty to me as there are very few enemy variations ( even different color pallettes could help with this ). The shortness of the game is not an issue to me because a beat-em-up shouldnt take longer than 1:30 to complete from start to finish. All in all I really wouldn't recommend buying this game even for $4 unless some improvements were made to the game. 

Possible things to improve (Each of these things should be done if possible)
- More than one playable character for story mode (Unlocks after completing easy mode first)
-Change the health regeneration system so theres actual health pick-ups (This helps to make the game feel less empty)
-Breakable items that may or may not contain weapons and health pick-ups 
-Enemy Variation
-Movesets of playable characters 

The moveset of Tim Burr is pretty basic which caused me to become bored of the gameplay pretty quickly. If I had more than a few ways to deal with single and multiple enemies I wouldnt mind the amount of repetition you get in this game.

Lastly, comparing this game to streets of rage is truthfully an injustice... | I confess I have no beard but I liked this game. Well, on the other hand I probably do have a beard - a virtual one because I remember when I was trying to beat Mighty Final Fight on NES and SNES (or was it Genesis? my memory is not what it used to be)...

So, this bear fighting sim is waaaay easier than Final Fight or other beat 'em up oldies - completed it in easy mode, died only once. Anyways would recommend trying it out once on a sale - you'll definitely have some fun moments and a kind of double-twist at the end :)

BTW played it with Xbox 360 controller hooked to PC - no issues at all except a sore thumb."

一周目困难难度全成就最需要注意的一点是，前面千万别乱买装备，哥几个凑活过得了
好家伙，险些就买不起成就甲了 | A fun little game. It plays a lot like the old Sega Genesis version of king's bounty but with less characters and more story. | Meh.  It's pretty simplistic, but I don't remember actually buying this game.  It just showed up in my library.  I've seen it there for years, with about an hour or two of play time, so I thought I'd download the game again and see what it was all about.

It's a very simple Tactics style game.  There isn't a lot of leveling options, there are no real maps, and there isn't a lot of unit choice.  You always have enough money, it seems, to max out units and equipment (on Normal difficulty, at least).  There isn't a lot of variety in enemy units, and there also is repeated nonsense dialogue in front of every shop or unit recruitment space.  Dialogue seldom fit in the dialogue box, either.  Wondering if that's from being translated into English, or due to the game being a port from... mobile?

But, it's short.  I'm a fan of Tactics style games, and while I wish there was more to this, the gameplay was JUST entertaining enough for me to beat this in two sittings.  It honestly reminds me more of a mobile game on the PC.  As I don't remember paying for this ever, I suppose it honestly must be worth it.  Killed about 5 hours of time on a boring holiday.  Would recommend if you get it for less than $5 and just want something dumb to kill time. | Un juego que no pasa de ser aceptable, no llega a ser lo suficientemente entretenido como para acabarlo más de una vez"

76561198082086866,1075740,Banners of Ruin,6.616666666666666,"RPG, Strategy",8,"i played around 10 hours on the switch and my first impressions were mostly positive, the game was fun, original, looked good, but it was pretty imbalanced, some runs i would be hit with some terrible RNG and have 0 chance of finishing it, in other runs i have such good RNG that i have fully leveled character in every slot with no issue, and the endgame was... not good really, it doesnt feel like you accomplished something that you care about.
After such a mixed experience im amazed they released not 1 but 4 dlcs, which i have not tried but i assume only makes the imbalancing worst. | This game isn't just another deck builder, its thoroughly tactical and enjoyable. Bear with the info dump of a tutorial though. Once you have started playing it you will get it really fast :) | Visually, Banners of Ruin is stunning, but it just doesn’t offer enough substance to back up its good looks. I really wanted a roguelite deck-builder with meaningful troop placement and movement, but the game barely lets you take advantage of those mechanics. The ruin system, for instance, feels half-baked, and there are so many underwhelming cards that just end up bloating your deck. Recruiting new party members just makes the bloat worse, so a lot of the systems feel like they exist solely to slow you down.

I haven’t tried any of the DLC, but I suspect its required to make the game fun. After a few hours felt like I’d already seen most of what the base game has to offer. Compared to other deckbuilders, Banners of Ruin feels limited and stiff, with slower progression that leans more heavily into grind than strategy. It left me wishing for a deeper system where synergies actually come together in a satisfying way, rather than a handful of random events and mechanics that never quite gel.

Its not completely unplayable, but I'm adding it to the ""unplayable"" steam game category I made so I don't have to look at it, and don't accidentally reinstall it, play it again, and experience the irritable mood it puts me in. | [Note: as of this writing Steam says my play time is 13 minutes probably because I have overwhelmingly been playing this off line.  My actual play time is approaching 40 hours, so this review is not as superficial as the incorrectly listed 13 minutes would imply.  In evidence of my actual play time, I have unlocked 87% of the achievements which I doubt is possible in only 13 minutes of total play.]

On initial playthrough I initially mistook Banners of Ruin as basically as DLC reskin for Slay the Spire being passed off as a different game.  This initial misconception was based on the fact that beyond merely being a deck-building card strategy there are a large number of similarities between the two, most notably the starter-deck for non-DLC-hero-characters in Banners of Ruin superficially looks all but identical to the one from Slay the Spire.  One unlocks cards and talents on repeated playthroughs through experience points just like Slay the Spire.  Even on further playthoughs the “fake ending” with the “fake final boss” being replaced by the option to push further to a proper ending with a real final boss if additional work was done and sacrifices were made, felt almost verbatim from Slay the Spire.  Numerous other smaller things like the racial ability of the weasels to produce three disposable poisoned throwing-blades will also feel a little too familiar.

This initial take, however, proved to be very shallow as while there are many similarities between these two titles there are also a lot of differences to the point where Banners of Ruin is not just effectively a “DLC reskin” of Slay the Spire but is own beast entirely.   Among the many differences between the two titles, the most significant in their differentiation I found to be the approaches in strategy required by Banners of Ruin resulting from the mechanics of positioning with ranks and lanes, as well as the whole aspect of the party / team instead of a single player controlled character as per Slay the Spire.  The interplay of not merely the cards with the cards, or the cards with the races/characters using them – both of which are experienced in Slay the Spire – is made considerably more rich and complicated in Banners of Ruin by interacting the aforementioned pairing combinations between different party members (up to six at a time) in different positions on the board (both absolute and sometimes relative to one another), and also against the positioning of the opponents on their board.  While there were many moments later in Slay the Spire where I had to really stop and think about the best use of my resources across the numerous possibilities presented to me each turn, the possibilities of action in Banners of Ruin in the later game just become shockingly more diverse, rich, and complicated beyond what ever occurs in Slay the Spire.  Most of the time I enjoyed that richness of possibility, but in some difficult and complicated battles I occasionally felt a bit overwhelmed by the massive combinatorics of competing cost-benefit analyses I had to try and weigh against each other to make even a single move.

There seem to be a few subtle bugs, or rather missed mechanic-combinations here and there in Banners of Ruin (at least as of this writing.)  I assume this is a result of the massive amount of potential complexity of operational options possible making play-testing all possible strange and nuanced combinations a little hard.  For example, there is a particular “Sacrifice” card (I forget its exact name among the few that contain the word “sacrifice”) – a card that is clearly about making a blood sacrifice to aid an ally – whose cost can actually be dodged.  I could be wrong, but I am pretty sure it was not intended to allow one to give a ridiculous benefit to an ally at no cost to one’s other character by allowing them to dodge their own self-blood-sacrifice but have it count as properly paid anyway.  Similarly there are a number of cards that specify characters be equipped for either 2-handed weapons or dual wielding, and some of these cards accept both when they don’t specify that (and don’t seem like they should.)  Further on that topic, some of the cards giving bonuses specifically to dual wielding actually also give their bonus to a normal load out consisting of weapon + shield when that looks wrong based on the nature of the card – I believe it was the card “Akimbo” seems to accidentally work in this way.

Banners of Ruin is definitely an enjoyable game and its own thing despite the superficial appearance of high-similarity in mechanics and structure to Slay the Spire, but for reasons I can’t fully understand or articulate I never found Banners of Ruin quite as thrilling or addictive as Slay the Spire.  Slay the Spire is a very high bar IMHO and so that is not a strike against Banners of Ruin that it does quite make it there in my book as it is fairly close.  In Banners of Ruin’s favor, I like the parties, equipment, art, world, and atmosphere a little more than Slay the Spire, but that is a subtle matter of personal taste that many might disagree with. | amo o jogo, mas podia ser maior

The game is good i beat carlos but i didn't beat my meat in the process because there's no mod. | A shining prime example of how the age of a well made videogame doesn't matter. Have you ever wanted a 2D metroidvania but with deeper combat? Well look no further! With an art style somewhere between classic cartoon network shows and flash animation. I'm not an expert on Mexican culture, but a friend of mine who lives there seems happy enough with this game, it's worth mentioning because EVERYTHING in this game is very much influenced by traditional Mexican culture, music, luchadors and the day of the dead.

Oh yeah, this game has gone through a lot of updates to make it more polished (earlier builds actually needed a seizure warning but that's been fixed!) there's a bonkers 4 player co-op if that's your jam (but no online play which is a massive wasted opportunity) and also lots of LOTS of references to other games, both classic and indie and even internet memes!

76561198082086866,345330,Eden Rising,0.0,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Strategy",0,"Nearing the final tech tiers I figure it is good a time as any to weigh in my thoughts on Eden Rising. This will be wordy but I feel game devs and consumers alike deserve a full response for their hard work/investment.  

	I picked this game up on sale before the free to play option was launched; my son loves TD games and I am a big fan of progression games of nearly any kind. So with this one hitting enough checks we both purchased a copy so we could play co-op together. 

	Performance was pretty poor; It didn't seem to matter if i played at high or low setting at 4k or 720p there were lag spikes and frame drops present throughout my entire playthrough so far. I will list my rig at the end of this for reference. This is the single most important aspect that will attract negative attention from the average consumer in my opinion. Performance is a gate that can be welcoming and open or an object that impedes the player base depending on how it's handled.

	I noticed right away that the combat left much to be desired in terms of fluidity as well as just about everything else that involved interaction with the game. There seemed to be stuttering or animation locking involved with every action in every area of the game; even gathering seemed slow and unresponsive with or without the use of the glove. A bit annoying but still playable in it's current form so we continued on.  I found myself preferring any type of range weapon over any type of melee weapon just to avoid the uncomfortable combat situations that were arising.  A game with aoe markers dodging functions and the possibility of fighting more than a few enemies at one time needs to not lock you into combat animations as much as possible.  There should be a consequence for trying to pull off a heavy attack on an opponent however it happens with all attacks which just makes me range to end fights before they are even able to hit me.  This makes combat very repetitive and unlikable(combat gloves really are an exception here and feel great but don't become effective until near end game).  I love the MMO style aoe combat markers and the elemental strength and weakness attributes of the enemies.

	The story is barely present in this game.  There are essentially lore nodes sprinkled throughtout the map hinting at what once was in this now mob infested/destroyed world. Its hard to care about any of it to be honest as neither you nor your character have any connection to this world at all. I don't like just giving negative feedback without suggestions but this needs a full overhaul in my opinion if the story is at all a goal in development.

	Exploration was fun; the environments were colorful and unique in each section and I enjoyed this segment of our play through. The enemies however could use a lot more variety. Falling into that good ole MMO trope of re-skinning the same mob is a pretty negligent decision to make these days.  I would suggest making a statement somewhere that says many of these mobs are just placeholders and more are on the way if you haven't already. There were also many mob placement issues with mobs being trapped under ground in nearly every area of the game.

	A couple hours in and I really got to take a better look at the progression systems; a decent variety of materials and upgrade paths for weapons, armor, and turrets was starting to tickle that progression bug I have, so, we dug in and got to work. While early on this was fun and seemed to be just the right amount of challenge I started realizing that something felt a bit off in this department.  As we neared the end of the tech trees it just felt like nothing had really changed.  The progression didn't really feel like progression.  In many other gathering crafting games you unlock ways to gather more efficiently or with less effort at a  certain point. (and please don't take this as a preference comment; I love grinding, like, really love it) however grinding should always feel like it pays off in games or it's just work for the sake of work.  The weapons didn't feel much stronger the turret upgrades are pretty negligible and if you needed healing bulbs, well, have fun running around and picking them up one at a time for hours on end to reach enough to last a session or two.

	There are some things happening here that are done well and probably often overlooked; the basic idea of the game is fun for a number of types of gamers. The ability to easily recover your loot if downed by an enemy or a misstep into a chasm is wonderful.  Having a stuck function that actually works all the time is great. The art style, while being obviously very opinion oriented, is well executed and uniform. The map is pretty huge and full of variety for a first installment and takes some time to get across while having teleportation access as a welcome time saver. 

	Now the part of Steam reviews that I honestly wish didn't exist; do I recommend purchasing Eden Rising?  Yes... and no... I think this game has great potential and can go more in the direction of an rpg, a souls like game, or even a survival crafting style game. It has  a bit of all of these elements but feels unfinished in this regard. The combat, movement, progression systems and story all need some serious tlc.  While I am ok with my investment into this product being that I picked it up on sale in early access I would not have been happy if I purchased at the new 25 dollar price tag. On that note I also cant recommend purchasing the crystal weapons pack either. They are just not necessary and to be frank even cosmetically speaking they are not nearly striking enough visually in my opinion. I really hope that the dev team pauses at this current iteration and flesh out what could be a great game. Please don't fall into the  mo' content mo' money method that is literally plaguing most all games released these days, for all of our sakes. If more time and effort are put into the amazing game I'm sure you made out to create then people will naturally come to you. (there is no neutral or yes but... rating on steam so I'm unfortunately forced to put a negative review for now)

	I personally know just how much work is involved in every asset that is produced for a game and I know that a ton of work and money has gone into this project so far, but, there are some hurdles that have to be overcome for a chance at true success.  I wish you luck and will be checking back periodically to see how it's all turning out.

(apologies for any grammatical/spelling errors present in this review, I am far from a writer and this turned out to be a lot more than I originally intended...) | While I haven't reviewed many games on Steam, I had to make an exception for Eden Rising: Supremacy. I've bought into plenty of Early Access titles that have made me swear to never believe in the hype again. Thankfully, Eden Rising has bucked the trend and made me believe that developers can produce EA games that are full featured and fun - while still having plenty more in store for those who eagerly await the next patches. Below is the story of the one crucial moment that made me a believer, and even though it's a bit long, I hope it will give people sitting on the fence an idea of what the world has in store for them. 

Firstly, I've spent a long time looking for an open world game that will let me get in over my head and suffer the consequences. Eden let my friends and I do just that. I'll paint the picture for you - we've played about 10 hours collectively at this point and we can hardly complete the main objective of the game (sieges) because we keep getting sidetracked by the open world and all of the secrets within. I had scouted a particularly fiesty band of 'mutant' enemies and I managed to convince my friend that we simply HAD to explore. Sure, the mutants would definitely kill us, but we might find a new weapon type or that healing item we'd been hunting for. He agreed to go with me and we sat at the edge of a cliff and stared down a wasteland full of mutant enemies - medusas, gorgons, and creatures that I had never seen before. I sprinted across the landscape, convinced that if I dodged just enough hits and zigged and zagged the right way, I might reach that unknown horizon. The mutant enemies tore me down quickly and my (wise) friend who had been waiting in the wings tried to resurrect me. The enemies spotted him and he barely managed to make it back to a safe hiding place. This continued for awhile until he was finally able to resurrect me. We were both critically low on health and the ranged mutant enemies would undoubtably kill us in a few hits. Still, I pointed out next destination on the horizon. We had made it this far, we had to go on. And so we did. We sprinted, panicked on Discord voice comms, and even used stealth to get to that checkpoint. We had no healing or siege supplies left but we had crossed the forbidden landscape successfully. I was jubilant, but the adventure wasn't complete. We had made it this far - why not take on the biggest enemy we could find? 

15 minutes later, the rest of the crew joined us and we spent 30 adrenaline filled minutes fighting a world boss that we weren't at all prepared to take on. The four of us laid down our siege weapons - the boss shredded them within a few attacks. We tried attacking from range and promptly died. We tried attacking from melee and found ourselves bombarded by a spore-based arsenal that crippled our fighters and made us feel like ineffective ants facing an insurmountable enemy. I lost count of the times my allies rezzed me and I saved them. Finally, after 30 minutes of panic, we defeated the world boss. 

The joy in that moment was similar to defeating a final boss in other games. Eden didn't prompt me to go on that adventure or kill the boss. The developers gave me an open world and let me dive in - even if I didn't have the armor, weaponry, consumables or understanding of the land that was needed to take on the boss. If you're looking for a game where you can explore, get murdered by gorgons, AND fulfill that tower defense itch - Eden is for you. | 这是一款很好玩的游戏。纯英文不是很影响，就是部分材料看不懂，但能愉快的玩下去。提一句，solo好难，能不能不要地图上所有素材都是树叶。顺便来一句，求中文 | Вообще отзыв нейтральный, но так как Габен до сих пор не догадался добавить эту кнопку, то пока что всё-таки придётся поставить палец вниз.

The gameplay, the story, the design, the atmosphere, the soundtrack. Everything is exactly how it should be and that is something rare in games because you usually find a thing or two wrong with a game no matter how small, but this game is the unlikely exception that I find truly difficult to complain about in any way. 
What really amazed me was the creativity and the love and care put into every aspect of the game. 

To be honest, you shouldn't even read reviews since there might be some possible spoilers or ideas for you of what this game really is. To have the best experience as most said on the store page, just go in blind with nothing more than a few general reviews and the store page itself, the WORST possible outcome is that you play it for a while, don't like it, then refund it, but that is still better than spoiling the game for yourself.
Enjoy the game | В этой игре поражение это часть процесса. Созданные тобой Гибрид и просто модифицированные карты твои спаситель, которые помогут содержать победу. Лично я не мог пройти игру без их помощи (и уробороса).
Было бы классно если бы разрабы создали настольную или мультиплеерную версию инскрипшн.
Хорошей игры | Это не просто игра, это настоящий шедевр. Сначала кажется, что нужно разбираться в карточных играх, чтобы понять эту и это самое большое заблуждение.

Хвост, плавники и другие ужасы, на поверку оказывающиеся классными ништяками. Пейджер, пепси, MTV – вот, к чему отсылает эта игра. Rad на сленге означает «очень привлекательный или хороший». Чёткий, классный, топовый, сасный. Времена меняются и приносят свои панегирики, но суть остаётся неизменной: будь крут, выделяйся, гордись, что ты не такой.

То, что в жизни ведёт к стагнации, в игре развлекает и веселит. Бум-бдыщ-бах, противники разлетаются, ты смеёшься. Неоновые вывески, сел-шейдинг и анонсеры из 80-х выходят на первый план, история остаётся за кадром. 

А нужна ли она, когда есть просто забег по джунглям апокалипсиса? Там, где Бордерлендс брал харизматичными персонажами и юморными квестами, Rad отказывается показывает средний палец, выставляет напоказ яркий кислотный ирокез и натягивает дерматиновую куртку в заклёпках, отказываясь погружаться в детали.

Не ищи смысл там, где его нет. Подростку не нужна логика и последовательность, так зачем она здесь тебе, дед? Это дерзость, это молодость, это прощается (и со временем, проходит).

Just can't anymore.
When Bungie actually puts in effort into their game (Aka, major DLC's minus lightfall) the game is amazing, but the amount of times they have dropped the ball, especially with this last episode/season has finally done it for me. I've followed Destiny since the original on the xbox 360, became a fan of the story, and continued on into Destiny 2 back when they were still part of activision on battlenet. I've always attempted to keep good faith and put in a good word even when the game was at a low point, but now after having the saint-14 and osiris gay love story interjected and shoved down my throat multiple times, the last season ""echos"" big bad guy get one shot in a cutscene and escape by floating down a vex ""milk"" river, and now the current episode which started by reusing a game mode that they butchered and made worse than the original which was still in the game and the other gamemode that came later which was decent but had loot that you could get just by running around in the standard maps made it not at all worth doing. Compound that with the tonic system that relied on Strict RNG to get new tonics which were necessary to get further in the reputation system and played a minimal part in the over arching story and took forever just to get three tonics out of DOZENS WHICH BARELY WORKED AND WAS ON A TIMER THAT YOU HAD TO MICRO MANAGE ON TOP OF OTHER MICRO MANAGING SYSTEMS.... yeah it was just TOO MUCH.  The final nail in the coffin was the fact that we found out just how much work they put into the seasonal / episodic content which normally is spread out when they gave it all at one time. By the way you could do all 3 parts of revenant in less than 3 hours which for something that you pay for is absolutely Pathetic. For comparison Warframe Is completely 100% FREE and has proven to have a better player experience, impactful story, developers that actually care, better visuals, smaller file size, did not take paid content away forever (yes that happened in destiny), and more. 

I loved this game because it's story at one point was amazing and now... it's a chore.  Combine all that with the current state of the company's choices and behaviors, it's just not worth trying to keep the rose tinted glasses on and support it anymore.  I loved this game.... and I just feel betrayed and disappointed.  Call me a Schill, say I'm coping, or a hater I no longer care. Like many said Destiny was the only thing that could Kill Destiny, and well they did it.  I'm done supporting Bungie until they get their collective heads out of their ass.

Edit as to Toasty's comments, I don't care if Osiris and Saint are gay, I care that the fact that they are gay is more of a Slap to the face and is way too frequent as a main story beat, it's not subtle like other characters and kept in the background as an aspect of the character which would have made the first Episode much more impactful story wise. As Toasty mentioned Warframe has these notions and explores it but it's subtle and not in  your face and distracting from the overall story which is why I exemplify it's story over This one. Take that as you will but I stand with my choice and opinion, don't be assholes just because you disagree and have a different opinion. | 10 year veteran of the franchise. this new season brings to me the unfortunate realization its over. the game had the most amazing expansion in its history, just to turn around and fire loads of staff. bungie vets who made this series what it is (was practically) are gone, and you can feel it. new season with no exotic armor at all, mediocre activity that is just the same recycled event, with recycled modifiers from older content that is extremely tiring, just cus it worked once doesnt mean they need to do it 3 or so times. the sandbox is in a pretty great state, but the creativity of the team is dying out, and the lack of employees and budget is extremely obvious. Pete Parsons is directly responsible for cutting hundreds of devs and bringing this ship crashing into the ground. Destiny is genuinely unenjoyable and within the hour i was bored. this is genuinely depressing as i have thousands of hours, and thousands on psn and have loved the game through some of its lowest points. but the mediocrity of this season is killing me. i genuinely am worried this game will actually die for real within this act. | I think this is the best game ever made and it's not very close. I started playing around the time it went free to play and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. No other game does what this one does. I think everyone should get to experience what Destiny offers. This rating is positive because of what this game has meant to me, not because of what it has become.

	[*]This game is so unfairly priced that I can't genuinely recommend any of my non-Destiny friends or new players to pick it up to try it out.
	[*]The community is toxic as hell.
	[*]The game is dying, fewer and fewer people get on to play every single day.
	[*]There are cheaters in 1/3 of Crucible games (might just be caused by the dwindling player count making the concentration of cheaters higher).
	[*]Every new update is bugged (sometimes to the point of unplayability) and results in either server downtime, another update to address it (takes a month for this to get released), or Bungie just giving up and auto-completing quest steps.
	[*]The new player onboarding experience is abysmal. You're given a 5 minute cutscene to explain the story (since they completely removed the real campaign), a couple of introductory quests, and then you're kicked out of the bird's nest to do whatever your heart desires with minimal direction or suggestion on where to go. So bad, in fact, that Bungie has given up and now provides players with an option to skip it entirely since they know that if a new player is playing this game, it MUST be at the direction of another existing player telling them what to do anyway.
	[*]The game is riddled with power creep. Guardian kits are the strongest they have ever been and new aspirational content has gotten easier and easier.
[/list]

Realistically, the game needs a reset like Destiny 1 got with the release of Destiny 2, but Bungie's insistence on this being a forever game post-Final Shape has led to Destiny 3 being nothing but a pipe dream while this game wanes in its final days after the equivalent of an Avenger: Endgame story beat. Bungie just doesn't know when to let it go.

I recommend this with one caveat:  If you don't want to grind for the end boss, watch a walkthrough on YouTube and save your money.  Good games are play-balanced so that by the time you reach the final boss, you usually don't have to grind to beat them.  This game requires a lot of grinding for the end boss, and there are a huge amount of things the game doesn't explain adequately (nor does the Internet).  Note:  I did not finish the game, and according to Steam achievement stats, neither did 77% of the other people playing this game.  Consider this fair warning.

Negative things - if you don't like them, find another game:

- GAME DOES NOT PAUSE IN COMBAT !!!  It's NOT turn-based !!!
- Can't run from battles
- Run is not fast enough (can only synth fast-run items in late game)
- Game doesn't save run or zoom settings
- Cannot zoom out far enough
- Camera is awful (stay zoomed out or get hit from behind, especially in caves)
- Not enough carried inventory space, and no synth items to increase space by first major boss fight (only good stuff is in late game, and it's insane to max out)
- You do NOT have ANY healing for first battles in forest (you die immediately with just one hit point in a fight)
- Invisible walls where you should be able to jump upward / downward (longer time to traverse level)
- Not all quest items are adequately identified - some are just items you pick up later in the game, not synthesized items
- Some quests have you scratching your head as to where to find the target (fairy creatures by weazel sanctuary)
- Some quests and main story cutscenes will not activate unless you take the long way to get there
- How to activate Extra Orders is not clear at all, even in the online manual - had to look it up on Google, and still having trouble activating them for the quests (even with the giant monsters)
- The party AI sucks (Lent doesn't use his multi-hit skill nearly often enough) - GO BACK TO PLAYER-CONTROLLED TURN-BASED PARTY FIGHTING
- The synth system is not good (compared to Atelier Sophie's method with a synthesis formula book and a cauldron-based synthesis grid)
- Exploration notes are practically maguffins because they're not explained properly - you have to find all landmarks to complete a region, THEN you can MAKE exploration notes on the atelier map
- The map systemS suck - you have one (down dpad) that shows you most of what you need (but only your current map region), but the other map (dbl square on Xbox controller) shows all the quests per region for all map locations --> This needs to be combined into one big map that you can see ALL the stuff and navigate to ALL the regions - I hit the wrong map button all the time
- Switching between gathering items sucks - yes, you can obtain different items by switching the gathering item, but doing so with MONSTERS MOVING AROUND SUCKS (see dragon temple entrance) - and then add the numerous camera issues, the slowness on the gathering item's swing, and the heavy penalty for the monster attacking you first
- Selling items for quests (two of them) is a royal pain - you can choose to sort by quantity (most in your container) or by quality, but NOT BOTH, which is necessary for quickly getting of low-grade items and keeping the high-grade items...and you need to sell 2000 for the first quest, and 4000 for the second quest
- You can't get to the higher areas without a special jump item, and it isn't revealed until near the end of the game
- MAJOR PROBLEM:  Items cannot be used if the item level is higher than a character's dexterity, and you CAN'T RAISE DEXTERITY (have to synth low-level healing / KO items for anyone but Ryza)
- CANNOT BUFF OR FORGE ARMOR (unlike in the Sophie series)
- The overpowered end boss is a two-stage fight with no healing or carry-over of AP, so you have to start over from tactics level 1 (unless there's some item that starts you off with a certain amount of AP per battle)
- To beat the overpowered end boss, you need to do a TON of synthesizing to up your armor stats - it's too much of a grind for me - this happened in the Sophie series as well
- When you Game Over, you respawn in the atelier, but you lose random items from your atelier basket, and that's not acceptable (time to reload)

This game series isn't for everyone.  I love the story, but the mechanics just suck (and the Sophie series wasn't much better in this respect).  If you love grinding synth recipes, you'll love this game.  If you don't, move on to something else.  There's lots of chances to insta-kill yourself too (especially with the special island that comes from DLC), so you have to understand the mechanics VERY well to flourish in this game.  Again, 77% of players never finished the game according to Steam, and I'm one of them - the final boss wiped one of my players right before the 2nd stage, then wiped out the rest of them, having 15000 HP and I'd lost my main hitter with no ability to raise them out of KO.  When I went to synth recover KO gear for another crack at the end boss, nobody but the main character had the Dexterity to use them.  I got tired of banging my head against the spiked brick wall, watched the end from a YouTube walkthrough, and now I'm moving on.  YMMV, but you've been warned. | While Sophie remains undefeated as my favorite alchemist, Ryza was blessed with incredibly fun JRPG combat and gorgeous visuals. No, I didn't mean it like that you pervs... | Overall a good game. The story is mostly good, nice and atmospheric, nothing amazing or surpising just a more basic calming story but with decent characters nicely done for the most part, though a few moments or individual lines do jar out here or there... 
Nice series of little side stories that help the world feel better, and random little character moments or scenes you encounter when moving around to keep things interesting.
The gameplay is good though not great, the combat is so so, the gathering alright, and the crafting alright, but with all three of them it stays more varied and so doesn't get tiring or repetitive as fast as moest JRPGs tend to.

Overall, it's nothing amazing, but still I came off feeling posotive from the experience, better than many JRPGs that just grind on and get super repetitive feeling with me only hanging on for the story or completion. Did get a bit so near the end, but never too bad and lasted much longer than most till there. Think I'll look into the other Atelier games when they're on sale, if a good one might pick up another.
 | Esse foi meu primeiro jogo da série Atelier, gostei bastante. O jogo apresenta ênfase em crafting e gathering com um sistema complexo e interessante. O combate achei bastante único, uma mistura de turnos com tempo real. O preço cheio é meio salgado pelo que oferece, mas como entra em promoção com uma grande frequência basta ter um pouco de paciência. | 42小时完美通关，战斗一坨，剧情寡淡但是没有大问题。炼金玩法挺好玩，做装备和发现稀有素材很有成就感。
战斗打一下立正好久，连锁手感严重不如同类回合制。道具太强大，技能基本不用开，必杀技伤害甚至不如一个玫瑰岩烧。还有普攻升级等级，扔道具也能升级，那我还普攻个啥。
剧情作为jrpg严重寡淡，但是能看。人物塑造得可以，但是cg全是廉价的对话，演出效果不理想。
能玩的一部作品，美术优秀，画风很吸睛。音乐差点意思（音乐曲目少大量复用）但是也在及格线之上。不打折不建议购买游玩体验。打折可玩，中规中矩的选择。无功无过。"

They also just added a new mobile game pay system that makes you pay to unlock something cheap and then to unlock something free. All the skins are also egregiously overpriced in general. It’s all there to just make you spend as much money as possible it’s trash. They don’t really care about the players they care about the money that’s it.

Hades es el resultado de depurar hasta el hartazgo lo que fueron Bastion y Transistor, más una dinámica Rogue-Like y una interpretación juvenil y mayormente desenfadada de la mitología Greco-Romana.

The amount of content in this game is astounding

The best single player experience I've had in a long time | 论剧情，整体是基于希腊神话而改编的作品，得益于希腊神话故事的错综复杂与有趣，使得整个游戏剧情上的人物便有许多对话可写，扎格列欧斯与神明的互动到众神之间的互动，几乎每一把都有新的对话产生。与之相伴的还有好感度，随着好感度上升解锁信物和越加亲密的对话。能与希腊神明近距离互动，着实是一个有趣的体验。本人最喜阿尔忒秘斯的形象，一是喜爱其所代表的领域，狩猎与自然，二是形象上，恩，这是个人喜好。
在背景故事上可以岔开来说一件事，就是希腊神话与人间秩序的关系，这也是我打游戏时候一直所想的。在神话设定中，神明都有所统治的领域，如战争之于阿瑞斯，爱情之于Aphrodite，狩猎之于Artemis，死亡之于hades等。神明是与人间的秩序所息息相关的，Hades在游戏中所重复的一句话，若凡人不害怕死亡，则还畏惧什么（大意应该是这样），由此也作为自己在地府中所操劳的理由。故不仅仅把希腊神话作为神明之间的故事来看，而是构建人间的秩序来看希腊神话，应该发现很多关于故事新的寓意所在，比如Orpheus欲带妻子从地府归来，其最终是以失败的告终，原因在于其因为其好奇违背了契约，若从构建秩序的来看，其寓意何在？对于契约的遵守？还是死亡的绝对性。其神话中各个英雄的故事，其应代表了一个文明所倡导的人格导向，那么英雄的悲剧，比如赫拉克勒斯的杀妻与十二试炼，这指向的什么？以上这是神话的内部构造的导向。其次是从神话与人间的互动来看，最典型的是以神明起誓，在游戏中是以hades之名，来获取神明的祝福。在现实中，这种习惯也是存在于希腊文明之中，其所发的誓言是以人的行为和神明所代表领域所相关的，如苏格拉底便常常以宙斯起誓，其欲带表之后的话的坚定或真实等。这种以神明来起誓的行为正是神话与人间秩序的互动所在，参见到中国，亦有“举头三尺有神明”，“天知地知”。这种构造可能是早期文明维持秩序的关键所在。我很好奇这种习惯是如何最初被构造出来并且传播。
论美术，这美术很好，特别是神明的立绘，是我一开始玩这个游戏的原因。要说怎么好吧，这一点说不来，我对于鉴赏艺术并不在行，只是符合自己顺眼的感觉，好听一点的话，就是这艺术与人内在目的的相互契合。
论机制，这个游戏的正反馈机制设计的很好，拉着我连续沉迷了三天，我根据我的自身体验来谈为何这个容易上瘾。首先是rogue机制，作为基底的武器种类与神明赐福的组合来带来不同的感觉，由此来刺激你去组合出各自不同的组合，我比较喜欢的是武器是罗摩弓和磁力拳套，赐福是Artemis的追踪箭搭配赫尔墨斯的快速攻击，刷刷刷地就清屏了。其次是人物，这游戏的文本量相对丰富，主要是体现在人物的对话上，几乎每一局游戏，你都可以与游戏人物展开新的对话，这个在rogue游戏里可不多见。且人物可能因为你的行为而产生出颇为有趣的对话，比如Hades会吐槽你在神殿的各种装修，在与神明对抗中选择使用神明的赐福，赠予蜜露以及美酒后产生的良性反馈。这一点促使我进行了后两天的游戏。不过比较难受的一点就是对话的随机性，导致一些解锁好感度对话需要很久才会出现，比如解锁好感度限度的对话，不少人物的好感度解锁对话真是难寻，以及解锁武器的新形态也是如此，我现在还没刷出chaos关于盾的对话，md好感度都满了。最后能够提供正反馈的就是各种收集和肝的系统，信物的等级，称号的等级，这些我是肝不动了。 | Every time I open this game I'm inspired all over again by the gorgeous art. The story is fantastic and the way the game incorporates dying into its mechanics is perfect for keeping players invested and building up experience. It took me an embarrassingly long time to actually beat the game and get the epilogue, but I had fun doing it!"

✅ Muito bom! | 挺好玩也好看，但只推荐玩前半，到差不多第七章节搓完月之盐体验旋转机制就行了，后面就是重复劳动了。
贤者之石贤者之盐谁搓谁享受，我玩这游戏从没体验过快乐.jpg 反正我搓了，我是抖m。
我不明白明明做了一个装备界面为什么只是展示。除了炼金术机分步解锁没有任何可以更换的设备，从头到尾手动研磨，年轻人的第一款玉兔模拟器。
但是话又说回来真全搓完了每天收收菜打发客人也还行。
感觉负声望体验比正声望好一点，恶人们只是干坏事搞事业，但是好人总是会莫名其妙地有小头控制大头的需求，看得很无语。 | 在2.0版更新之后终于成为一款有点可玩性的游戏了。
天天搓药剂像上班一样难免枯燥，花园和装修功能的加入并不能使上班更有奔头。完全没有探索新的药剂效果和制作贤者之盐的动力，每次打开玩玩就觉得有点浪费生命。
但是同题材依然没有更好的竞品，依然推荐来圆一个炼金术士梦。 | 好玩，看似是炼金模拟器实际是种菜模拟器。如果是像我一样不太能接受长时间重复劳作的建议选最低难度，毕竟和普通难度相比单纯减负节省时间何乐而不为，后两个难度就是挑战自我了，至少我是懒的为附加要求重新调配一遍的，也不是很追求最低利润精益求精的，毕竟是奔着标签的放松来的。

游戏的前景还是相当好的，能种菜能装修，看制作组公告未来还会推出更多配方和材料，一到九章在正常难度下还是相当紧凑好玩的，虽然后面每章东西比较少但是也不太繁琐，属于刚好可以接受的程度，而且探索未知发现新药，同时看出场的联动角色还是很有意思的。但是问题也是有的，后期的正反馈太少了，重复机械化劳作很折磨，至少我是不愿意每天收菜再浇水，每次研磨摇断手，都这么有钱了雇个员工我也愿意，而且这种世界观用魔法自动干活也很合理吧。除此之外庭院升级比较慢，天赋树比较浅显，第十章也不太行，前面几章还是比较紧凑的，第十章作为最终章需要的贤者之石贤者之盐太麻烦了，本身后期就比较枯燥了，看到这么多要专门调配的，于是摆了，不过要是能调配出来显然还是很有成就感的。

但总的来说还是相当好玩的，直接上头熬夜游玩。 | [b]OVERALL RATING[/b]
✔ [u]Nothing more to add – 6/6[/u] ✔
It’s fun, that’s all – 5/6
Interesting – 4/6
Mid – 3/6
To play when bored – 2/6
Not good… - 1/6

[b]GAMEPLAY – 6/6[/b]
It’s simple, yet enjoyable. Perfect for relaxation. Mechanics are easy to understand, discovering new substances, potions and characters it’s addictive. The newest update adds some new elements. Thanks to them, game is „fuller”. 

[b]DIFFICULTY – 1/6[/b]
Very easy. You don’t need to be genius, to understand all game features. Money, points, ingredients – everything is easy to get, especially in the late game. Making potions is simple, after update, even simpler. Only more time consuming substances are two last ones, but all you must have is patience. 

[b]EMOTIONS – 3/6[/b]
Relax, nothing more. Nothing can scare or sadden you. Maybe you can feel some satisfaction. That’s why, neutral rating.

[b]PLOT/DIALOGS – 4/6[/b]
Besically, pieces of individual customers and sellers histories. That’s all. 

[b]CHARACTERS – 5/6[/b]
Overall just repetitive NPCs, but from time to time, recognizable characters are visiting your shop. They look like them and dialogs are refering to their worlds. Sometimes they just look like someone recognizable, or idk, maybe that’s just my imagination – I’m talking about crystal seller, who reminds me of a certain famous, bald, chemistry teacher… suspicious…

[b]GRAPHICS – 6/6[/b]
Medieval style, but in modern way. Pleasant, perfectly matches vibe of this game.

[b]MUSIC – 4/6[/b]
Matches well, but it’s little monotonous. Literally background music, so after a while you stops paying attention to it.

76561198082086866,1217060,Gunfire Reborn,76.33333333333333,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG",75,"While I appreciate the character DLCs, I don't really like the direction this game has taken for replayability. Having seasonal mechanics tacked on seems like the easy approach but doesn't add much to the overall game. They really should take the Dead Cells model with the stage scheming and add more branching zones and tilesets to make things feel fresh. Add more variety to the rooms per stage, like with the recent anxi desert change. Stick to one overarching mechanic that players can keep grinding on instead of adding seasonal ones that shift character useability and run approach every 4 months.

Subsequent updates also seem to be introducing some lag to the game. Tabbing out, even in singleplayer makes the game hang for a split second. Entering one room in multiplayer after someone else causes the game to hang at times. If the devs really do want to stick to the seasonal plan, then expand the skins to include the characters as well and make them limited to events! Soul essence is already a persistent currency that players can acquire with a grind. | I've sunk a few hundred hours into this game; once you grasp the connections between guns, abilities, and scrolls, it becomes  seriously addicting. I've played every season variation, and the way star link expands upon your character build is the most fun yet. I can easily justify $20 due to the amount of content it offers. | I didn't give this game much thought until I started playing it. The game is a well-made rogue-lite that's fun to play. The experience is even better with friends, up to three people, or you can find online matches.
I've highlighted 3 points that I think are important to mention:

Seasons
The season system is well-made. I've only played the last 2 seasons. At first, it's hard to understand the mechanics, but you get the hang of it over time. You just have to pay close attention to the readings, but they're very fun and varied. The season pass is free, easy and quick to get, and gives you beautiful and well-made cosmetics, which is a very positive point.

Replayability
I particularly enjoyed replaying the game. Putting on a playlist to listen to while playing is a pleasant experience. The game has many achievements and some of them require time and effort to complete, a huge variety of weapons to unlock, which gives a great feeling when you get a new weapon, in days when in any game you have to keep paying to get new things in the game (the game has 3 DLC with weapons, but the game also adds free weapons in each season).

Game modes
The game has few modes, only three, being the conventional mode, the main game mode where you have the stages and their difficulty to choose and challenge yourself and it is in this mode that you unlock most of the weapons and achievements in the game. The daily challenge mode, nothing special, the name already says what it is, a mode with a modifier that changes daily, just to get some achievements and challenge yourself. And the last mode, the horde mode, is a mode where you can equip some improvements to your characters and fight against large hordes of enemies that get harder and harder over time, but it has a final boss, so the hordes end. It's fun, but it only has two maps so far, and it ends up being repetitive.

My final thoughts are that the game is worth it for those who like games of this style, it's very different and diverse from the others. For the base game I think the price is worth it, but for the DLC I think it's worth waiting for a sale.

Enjoy and feedback! :) | Eu queria muito dar uma tryhardada em Gunfire Reborn, mas estava meio complicado de jogar sozinho. Então, surgiu uma promoção de conteudo adicional do game e resolvi comprar uma das 3 DLC's do jogo.
E rapaziada... de longe foi a melhor coisa que eu ja fiz!!! ^^ 

Gunfire Reborn é um game Roguelike/Roguelite, FPS, com leves elementos de RPG. Existem 12 personagens jogavéis que são bicinhos bem fofinhos (não sei se chega a ser furry), em que todos possuem 2 habilidades unicas e especiais, dando uma pegada de que cada run seja realmente diferenciada e unica. 6 são free, onde você desbloqueia apenas jogando, e os outros 6 são de dlc's. 

O jogo possui bastante coisa legal, como uma variedade boa de armas, inimigos, pergaminhos para buildar e uma arvore de talentos bacana até.
Durante a play, você vai se deparar com 3 steps até o final. É como se fosse o começo, meio e fim, bem padrão!! E em cada stage diferente, existe a possibilidade de vir 2 tipos de chefes. É sempre sortido, nunca da pra saber ao certo quem vai vir. 

Agora, como eu disse la em cima, no começo era realmente f0da de jogar sozinho. Eu até tive a cara de pau de sair chamando usuarios aqui da Steam pra jogar junto a mim, mas foi tudo em vão, infelizmente kkkkkkkk. Masssss, acabei descobrindo que da pra colocar bots [IA] pra ajudar e facilitar a gameplay!!! E isso foi extremamente util. *-* 
Eles até atacam, mas no geral são bem ignorantes KKKKKKKKKK, o que de fato eles são bons é em te levantar quando você é derrubado por algum monstro, assim evitando que sua jornada seja finalizada precocemente!!!!! 

Os graficos até que são decentes. Os mapas e cenarios são bem variados! Alguns são curtos e outros extensos. A arte do jogo é legal e a trilha sonora é meio chatinha mas da pra se acostumar.
Uma coisa que eu não curti muito foi que pra jogar no controle é meio ruimzinho. Eu sugiro muito que se você puder, jogue com um mouse & teclado. No joystick da pra brinca de boa, mas vai por mim e confia no que eu to falando!!!!!!!!!! Outro ponto também é a fisica e movimentação dos bonecos. É tudo muito duro, meio travado! Parece que os bichos tão com 500kg de concreto nas roupas huehuehuehuehue. 
Mas enfim... creio eu que isso seja proposital do jogo mesmo. Até porque tem itens que te dão um pouqinho a mais de velocidade. 

E pra encerrar, se você quer muito jogar sofrendo o minimo possivel eu recomendo duas coisas: a primeira é que jogue com amigos e conhecidos!!!! Vai ser bemmmmmmm mais ""suave"" a caminhada de todos até ficarem full broken. E a segunda é, caso for jogatinar sozinho, compre a DLC chamada Artisan and Magician. Vai por mim, de longe este conteudo adicional é DISPARADO o melhor de todos. Ela possui uma personagem bem OP que vai melhorar bastante o seu early game. 

E é isso aew galera. Sem sombra de duvidas recomendo simmmmmmmmmm Gunfire Reborn a todo mundo!!!!!!!!!!! Muito obrigado a você que chegou até aqui, um forte abraço e nos vemos nas proximas analises. Até la, bjbjbjbj e fuyyyyyyyyyyyy :* õ/ 


NOTA – 1O/1O | A fun roguelite shooter with well implemented gunplay and lots of arms to experiment with different mechanics. If you need a time sink, go for it."

A few of the selling points are as follows:

1.Killer Campaign: It's not the longest in history, but an excellent story with a few adrenaline pumping moments and fluid gameplay. The game cleverly weaves mechanics together that never subtract, only add to the way you play.

2.Movement:This game has such a fluid movement system, it always feels like reaching a new spot to kill an enemy always feels possible. The transitions are smooth and intuitive

3. Gunplay- Amazing set of firearms that readily invite plenty of customization. The guns feel good to shoot and never feel clunky

4.MECHS- I for one am obsessed with mechs, and this game really scratches the itch. The titan classes are both fun and interesting to learn, each with their own personality in multiplayer

Respawn, if you're listening... I will gladly support a titanfall 3 if it ever comes to surface.

10/10 Titanfalls | Titanfall 2 is nothing short of a gem in the world of first-person shooters, blending fluid mechanics, engaging storytelling, and thrilling mech-based combat into one unforgettable package. Released in 2016, it stands as a testament to how innovation in game design can produce something truly special. However, despite its brilliance, the game now faces challenges in its multiplayer landscape, largely due to being overshadowed by its battle royale sibling, Apex Legends.

[h1]Campaign: A Perfectly Executed Storyline[/h1]
One of the standout features of Titanfall 2 is its campaign mode, which is widely regarded as one of the best in FPS history. The story revolves around Jack Cooper, a humble rifleman who unexpectedly forms a bond with a Vanguard-class Titan, BT-7274, after his pilot is killed in action. Their journey together is emotional, exciting, and filled with clever twists. The dynamic between Jack and BT brings heart to the narrative, making the story more than just a vehicle for the action.
Each mission introduces new mechanics that keep the gameplay fresh, from wall-running platforming challenges to time-travel puzzles. The creativity behind these sequences ensures that every level feels unique, culminating in a finale that will leave you in awe.

[h1]Gameplay: Smooth, Fast, and Addictive[/h1]
Titanfall 2's gameplay is its crown jewel. The movement mechanics are unmatched, offering fast-paced wall-running, double-jumping, and parkour-like traversal that feels incredibly fluid and rewarding. Whether you’re darting across walls in a tight gunfight or dropping into a Titan from orbit, the gameplay never stops being exhilarating.
The combat offers a seamless blend of infantry and mech-based gameplay. Titans, the giant mechanized war machines, add a layer of strategy to the combat. Each Titan comes with unique abilities and playstyles, ensuring there’s something for everyone. Pilots and Titans complement each other perfectly, making every battle feel dynamic and intense.

Multiplayer: A Double-Edged Sword[/h1]
Titanfall 2’s multiplayer was revolutionary at launch, providing chaotic and action-packed matches where players could seamlessly switch between Pilots and Titans. Modes like Attrition and Last Titan Standing kept players hooked with a mix of tactical and frenetic gameplay. The progression system, customization options, and map designs were all top-notch.
Unfortunately, time has not been kind to Titanfall 2’s multiplayer. With the rise of Apex Legends, Respawn Entertainment’s wildly popular battle royale game, Titanfall 2's servers have become much less active. It’s a sad reality that this incredible multiplayer experience has been largely abandoned by the player base, leaving many matches sparsely populated or difficult to find. For a game that thrives on competitive energy, this lack of activity is a noticeable drawback.

[h1]Graphics and Sound Design: A Feast for the Senses[/h1]
Visually, Titanfall 2 still holds up beautifully, even years after its release. The environments are diverse and detailed, ranging from lush forests to industrial war zones. The Titans themselves are intricately designed, showcasing their power and scale.
The sound design is equally impressive. The heavy footsteps of a Titan, the crackling of energy weapons, and the atmospheric music all combine to immerse players in the game’s sci-fi universe. It’s a sensory experience that feels both grand and intimate.

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
Titanfall 2 is a masterclass in first-person shooter design. Its innovative gameplay, heartfelt campaign, and exhilarating multiplayer make it one of the finest FPS games of its generation. However, the decline in multiplayer activity and the rise of Apex Legends have left this incredible game underappreciated by newer audiences.
If you haven’t experienced Titanfall 2 yet, it’s a must-play for the campaign alone. It’s a love letter to innovation in gaming, and for those lucky enough to find a multiplayer match, it’s a reminder of what peak FPS multiplayer can look like. Whether you’re new to the series or a returning fan, Titanfall 2 deserves your attention, it’s a game that truly deserves to stand tall, even if its servers are quiet. | Worth it for the campaign alone, but you get a sick co-op mode on top!

... and of course multiplayer, but that's too fast-paced for me."
76561198082086866,1253860,Neurodeck : Psychological Deckbuilder,0.3,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",2,"这是一款未完成，甚至都不算“半”成品游戏，介意就别往下看了。

优点：
1.游戏主要是选择不同游戏角色，进行心理深入探索，帮助角色找到属于ta们自己的恐惧症并战胜它。概念满分，至少我还没玩过关于恐惧症这个题材的卡牌游戏，而且我一直很喜欢【哲学】或【心理】类型的游戏；

2.【恐惧症】是游戏中的大小boss，包括了【日光恐惧症】、【触摸恐惧症】、【聚集群体恐惧症】......每个恐惧症的能力都不同，而且有不同阶段。在与【怀孕的恐惧症】对战中，恐惧症会有三个阶段：出生-开始劳作-产后抑郁。每个阶段恐惧症对自己的攻击特性都不一样，我得根据阶段打不同的牌来应对。这里就很写实了。

团队给女性角色设计了【男子气概恐惧症】和【怀孕恐惧症】感到有创意，而战胜它的方式也会给玩家带来一些灵感，这在生活中确实存在的而且是具体的病症一种。我会认为这样的boss设计是有在好好观察生活；

3.在获取与部署你的卡牌技能中间会穿插一些故事 ，喜欢一边玩游戏一边读故事的玩家有福了，故事的目的是讲述一个人不同的心理压力，或者恐惧有可能来源于什么，这能帮助玩家由浅入深地了解自己，学习识别恐惧症成因的征兆；

4.正式对战中我们的红蓝主要被设计为【耐力】和【理智】，耐力等于蓝也就是魔，理智等于红也就是血，每次使用卡牌都会消耗对应数值的耐力，而部分卡牌会消耗理智，但理智的损伤主要来自于你正在对战的恐惧症发出的攻击。这个寓意我也很喜欢，战胜恐惧症的根本是你必须有足够的耐力和保持理智，也许你无法马上战胜它，但只要你有足够的耐力和时间，迟早会胜利的；

5.游戏设计还涉及身心灵概念，选择你想要发展的一个方向，会激活角色的一些特性或品质来帮助你在每次对战中获得有利条件，比如坚韧、勇敢啥的，在游戏过程中你也可能选择做一些心理测试来获得新的热性和品质，如执着、内向等等。在游戏刚开始的时候，选择你的情绪状态（愤怒、乐观等）也会影响你后续有可能遇到的特性与品质，并开启你这次控制的游戏角色的天赋能力。

6.卡牌内容

目前没太明白卡牌分哪些类型，应该是基础的手牌、装备牌、状态牌。卡牌的内容很贴近生活，比如【善意的想法】、【随意的想法】、【解压球】、【火车旅行】、【写日记】、【爽口的食物】......游戏在告诉我们通过哪些方式和行为可以帮助我们战胜恐惧症。比如我们可以通过使用【阅读心理学书】卡牌获得更多耐力，去【听音乐会】可以攻击恐惧症等等；

当然也有些卡牌有点搞笑。

首先有些卡牌可以增加你的怒气值，比如【拳击运动】、【倒霉的一天】，怒气值是额外伤害，可以叠加状态。在你每次使用攻击恐惧症的牌时就会增加额外伤害值，帮助你更快战胜恐惧症；

但是，如果你使用【酗酒】卡牌增加愤怒值，那你的耐力支付也更多，很快就会输掉。这就是愤怒在你人生中的正反面，我们常说要保持愤怒，但不要失控愤怒；

如果你没有可以增加怒气值的卡牌，这时候有一款搞笑牌可以帮到你——【家庭聚会】，它让你每次休息时恢复的理智都转变成怒气，太好笑太讽刺了；

有一张牌叫【大扫除】，使用它的话会在和恐惧症对战的时候，伤害对方5点生命值，但同时变多两张【大扫除】出来。（只要你愿意搞卫生，你就会有搞不完的卫生......）这其实在形容焦虑症和洁癖 ？有的人就是因为压力或者创伤太严重 ，想通过大扫除让自己好受点 ，但没有用， 反而更焦虑 ，于是发癫地一直搞卫生。 游戏通过这个牌的使用方法来阐述了这种心理症状；

有一张牌【纹身】，居然可以令人失去理智值， 但同时挫伤恐惧症， 也就是纹身令你冲动又勇敢，这真的......哈哈哈很刻板印象，作为一个有很多纹身的我有点笑到了；

我会觉得娱乐性挺强的。

缺点：

1.只是一款未完成游戏，游戏并没有注明是试玩或者仍在开发中（我看了下发布时间这么久估计是项目被放弃了，就不知道是能力问题还是运作资金问题），你哪怕把名字写成《意识迷宫第一章》也可以，真的有点过分了。我看到褒贬不一的时候就应该想到的，而且我在评论区看有人控诉游戏没做完，我以为是内容更多但没有最终结局，然而它只有第一个游戏角色的内容。各位购买需谨慎。

2.我不知道创作团队是因为认可女性这一生遇到的挑战和恐惧比较多呢，还是说因为游戏没做完只做了女性角色可被深入探索，但是两个女性角色通关后会有一个“我为什么玩意识迷宫”，点击阅读可能这是参与制作的人之一，如果两个可探索的女性角色就是制作人本身的话，那我收回前面的话。基于个体经验所做的游戏值得尊重，然后因为本身是女性所以如此设计，并无任何不妥。

3.好的你没做完就算了，你成就里把第二个角色的所有都放上去了，我解锁不了成就看着逼死强迫症，你别跟我说强迫症也是恐惧症的一种，我才不要战胜，

4.我有点不能理解在探索女性心理恐惧的时候，一些帮助性的卡牌为什么被设计为【爷爷的奖章】、【大伯】，好像是说女性必须借助男性的帮助才能战胜恐惧症，我这里不是乱打拳，听我细说。

因为我觉得某种程度上来说，女性是很难从父辈那里获得支持的，比如在击退【男子气概恐惧症】时你需要男性亲戚的帮助不觉得有点悖论？你对男子气概的恐惧说不定就是来源于家庭中这些素质低下没有边界的男性亲戚。不都说女儿亲妈妈，尤其到了一定年龄比较能共情母辈，我觉得应该设计一些女性亲戚或者朋友的帮助卡，来协助游戏中女性角色战胜恐惧症会更真实。

你看生活中也是这样的，女性需要的一些帮助男性其实很难共情和提供方法，就比如结婚和生育，女性会向母亲寻求经验建议，不婚不育的女性也会有很多只能跟闺蜜谈不能跟异性谈的课题，比如月经羞耻和被性侵；

5.同样在一条故事线上，有的图标有注解，有的没有，让人玩起来有点糊涂，指引不足。有些文字有翻译有些没有，虽然是基础英文，但也很影响观感，毕竟这是个文字卡牌游戏。翻译了的文本中，同样一个意思，可能被翻译成两种中文，所以当具有这两个解释的卡牌同时出现让我选择时，会让我很焦虑，明明两张牌的使用次数一样的我却需要停下来仔细想想，增加了不必要的理解成本。

6.控制女性角色时，有我看不懂的卡，比如【月经】让你失去10理智，这个真的不是在搞事情吗？太歧视了，并不是所有女人都受月经影响，而且严重影响的已经构成另一种恐惧症，那为什么不是设计为boss而是卡牌？？别夹带私活污名化吧，如果设计团队不懂，那我建议寻求一下专家咨询。但话说回来，如果了解游戏又明白这里的理智主要是象征血条，又觉得还挺有道理的，来月经可不就是掉血，然后这张卡牌使用后会生成一张别的卡帮助你攻击恐惧症，来月经可以战胜恐惧症......我也是没太懂这个设计......；

更新：bug实在是有点多，翻译也乱，今天又玩了一遍，想想还是挺难得有这个题材的游戏，所以我还是给好评吧，希望将来有同题材游戏做得更好！ | 东西太少，玩玩就通关了。"

ローグライクを求めると結構肩透かしをくらってしまうかもしれません。 | Super fun until NG+3 (for reference, the ""true ending"" can be achieved by NG+7), then the stat % upgrade grind gets way too tedious. For a roguelike, there are not enough meaningful variables during a run to make grinding for hours fun.

Still, it's a clear improvement over Rogue Legacy 1 with a large class variety and fluid movement. Once all abilities are unlocked, I think it's much better in the ""movement"" part than some other highly rated games like Hollow Knight or Dead Cells.

It's one of those games you come back to every year for a few runs."

       王子的故事是很简单的，简单的就像宇宙之下看见的任何一颗繁星。或许Deiland不是那么震撼的故事剧情，不是那么美轮美奂的场景，又或者说是精美的人物。在我玩了这款游戏后，也很难说这是一款神作，乃至一个“好”游戏。
      在过去未来的某一天，我难免会一个人寂寞，经历了失败，又或者地沉迷而一蹶不振。如果又有很多我觉得开心的日子呢，可能是考试成功，事业有成，又或者只是简单的一份快乐。那有哪一天我需要沉淀一下呢，需要一个安静独享的氛围，往往在人生中的一份升华，只是不经意间，我想我不是在轰轰烈烈中成就的人，我觉得我不是一个特别的人，茫茫人海中，型同他人，却又不同他人。
      在Deiland这个游戏里，我得到了一个小小的启发，我发现世界其实没有那么复杂，它简单直接，却又难以用简单的语言表达。宇宙是一个整体，而不同的星球就是不同的世界，但是却又属于同一个世界。Deiland也好，众多其他魔幻的世界也罢，甚至是现实，也是归于一个整体，我想，那个整体一定是人们，是我们。我们缔造悲欢，七情六欲，知识文化，历史古今······纵游千古，我看到至乐，至悲，看到昨日，我欢笑，忧愁。但奈何，我也是结束这款游戏开始，我觉得，一切都过去了，我上周还在做什么事，这周又干了些什么，或许我记住了，但是也就过去了，在游戏的角度上，他们可以重来，从人生来看，我们或许想重来也不行了。Deiland的也是，它简单的剧情玩法，也是一个另类的人生，有别于现实的游戏。
      放下了游戏，关掉了电脑，转头可能就是学业，事业。迫于生活的节奏，可能就是消遣完了便是睡觉，迎接新的一天。我不能保证新的一天或许更好，但是一定会发生新的事，即使再相同的一天。Deiland也是如此，地球上也是如此，他每一刻都在运转，每一刻都是未知，不论过去将来，这可能就是新时代一个普通人对于世界的认识，既不深刻，却也不是那么简单。世界教给我的不多，是一个人生。Deiland告诉我的也不多，是一个简单的世界。是从简单世界中透射到现实的一小份美好，以及一份小小的憧憬。
      我想在于游戏方面，我认为不适合用批判的眼光去判断这个游戏，我可以告诉以测评角度想去玩的玩家们，这个游戏也不精美，不宏达，令人印象也不深刻，当然，我觉得还是部分因人而异。Deiland的只是在不经意间送了我一份厚重的大礼，独特的礼物，美丽的梦境。这是一个买给自己的游戏，哪怕这个世界不是那么渴望你得到他。就像不经意来的这个世界一样，从熟悉到陌生地消散，淡化。
      语言能力有限，表达的没那么清楚。但这个游戏我很推荐，但是局限于他也同样打动了你。谢谢你坚持看到我这不成熟文字一直到这里。谢谢Deiland
 | This game seemed to be exactly what I was looking for, and I have definitely had fun playing it, but it has room for a lot of improvements. It feels like an early access game, something incomplete and lacking.

1. There are some bugs. For example, when I upgraded the home with a laboratory, the lab never showed up and all my items disappeared. The house did not upgrade.

2. The characters don't have any depth to them, the NPCs don't make much sense, it's curious why the main character just goes along with what strangers ask him to do without any question. THe quests don't feel satisfying and are too easy. There is very little point in farming past a certain point.

3.  You don't have much room to move things around. For example, you begin the game with 3 crop fields and can't move those at all to any other location. You can't move your house around either. You have a limited space in which to grow trees and bushes as well.

4. The fishing system is a disaster, you can't really fish, except maybe once a day.

5. There is no way to have two save files. If I start a new game to show a friend, my game is gone.


Overall this game feels very weak and incomplete, but what little content there was was very enjoyable, I hope to get more similar content. I hope this game can grow into something worth playing, but as it is I cannot recommend it. | Not an RPG.

The Little Prince lives on a tiny Eden. One day, Saint-Exupérette lands and tells him he must mine and farm and forge and cook and fight 18 hours a day, 7 days a week, so that he can finally reach materialist happiness. The children's book turns into a Stakhanovite fantasy, albeit a money-driven one.

You have absolutely no freedom, no options, no control on any event. There is a RNG as a bonus, therefore I had to wait 4 hours to get the correct monsters to pop up and beat, 3 times, in order to get the right loot and be able to progress the game.

2 positives: the round little planet (the title's selling point; the other planets are just as small but flat and full of invisible walls,) and excellent controls, well designed and comfortable (until you happen to fight near a well and die because you become a sitting duck carrying water buckets.)

76561198082086866,203160,Tomb Raider,0.0,"Action, Adventure",0,"As a long-time fan of the original Tomb Raider games, I found the 2013 reboot deeply disappointing. While the game excels in visuals and technical execution, it sacrifices the series' core identity: exploration and puzzles, in favor of relentless combat and excessive action sequences. The ""Shantytown"" section epitomizes this shift, forcing players into repetitive, nonsensical battles with hordes of enemies, completely sidelining the essence of discovery that defined the classic games.

The narrative also falls apart under basic scrutiny. For instance, the sheer number of fresh corpses, mummified remains, and skeletons scattered across the island suggests that it must have been the unfortunate destination of dozens—if not hundreds—of fully loaded cruise ships over decades! And let’s not forget the absurd logistics: how do you even feed and sustain an army of enemies that large on an isolated island? To top it off, aside from the mummified queen, there are no women in the cult that occupies the island, just an endless parade of men. It’s not only implausible but also a glaring failure in representation. Laughable.

For those seeking the intelligent exploration and challenging puzzles of the original series, this game may leave you frustrated and exhausted. If you're looking for an action-heavy adventure, it might suit your tastes, but fans of the classic Tomb Raider should approach with caution! | Juegazo al principio no le tenia mucha fe pero despues de jugar un rato descubri que es un juegazo el combate y la exploracion es buenisimo y todos los coleccionables y  mejoras son espectaculares. 10/10 | Гарна та дуже драйвова гра.

Overview: Tomb Raider (2013) is a reboot of the classic action-adventure franchise, offering a fresh origin story for the legendary adventurer Lara Croft. Developed by Crystal Dynamics, the game takes a more grounded and gritty approach to Lara's character, portraying her transformation from a vulnerable young woman into the hardened explorer she's known for. Combining exploration, puzzle-solving, and intense combat, the 2013 iteration offers a blend of action and survival mechanics set on the mysterious island of Yamatai.

Story: The story follows Lara Croft, who, along with her crew, becomes stranded on the island of Yamatai while searching for the lost kingdom of Himiko. The island, however, is home to many dark secrets, including a dangerous cult and other perils that put Lara’s life in constant jeopardy. Throughout the game, Lara faces various challenges and fights to survive, all while uncovering the island’s mysteries and discovering her own strength.

The narrative is engaging, focusing on Lara's personal journey and her development as a character. The story touches on themes of survival, trust, and the cost of discovery, with the stakes rising as Lara delves deeper into the island’s secrets. The characters are well-developed, though the focus is primarily on Lara, making her transformation and growth the heart of the plot.

Gameplay: Tomb Raider (2013) brings a mix of exploration, platforming, puzzle-solving, and combat. The controls are smooth and accessible, with an emphasis on both exploration and action. As Lara navigates the island, players engage in intense combat against various enemies, including mercenaries, wild animals, and the island’s cultists. The combat system is robust, offering a variety of weapons, from bow and arrows to firearms, as well as a range of stealth and melee attacks.

The game also features light RPG elements, allowing players to upgrade Lara’s weapons and abilities as they progress. This adds a layer of depth to the gameplay, encouraging players to explore the island thoroughly to collect resources and improve their equipment. There are also collectible items and hidden treasures scattered throughout the game, rewarding those who take the time to explore off the beaten path.

Graphics and Performance: The graphics in Tomb Raider (2013) are exceptional, with lush environments, stunning character models, and impressive lighting effects. The island of Yamatai is beautifully designed, ranging from treacherous cliffs to dense jungles, all rendered in high detail. The character animations, particularly Lara’s, are lifelike, and the facial expressions convey emotion and intensity. The cinematic cutscenes are integrated seamlessly into the gameplay, making the narrative feel fluid and immersive.

The game runs smoothly on most modern systems, with well-optimized performance. On higher settings, the visuals are breathtaking, but even at lower settings, the game still maintains a high level of quality.

Audio Design: The audio design in Tomb Raider is excellent, with a haunting and atmospheric soundtrack that complements the game’s tone. The sound effects are realistic, from the sounds of Lara’s footsteps on different surfaces to the crackling of fire and distant roars of danger. The voice acting, particularly from Camilla Luddington as Lara Croft, is solid, adding depth to the character’s emotions as she faces peril after peril.

Challenges: While the game is generally well-balanced, some sections can feel a bit repetitive, especially in terms of combat. Some of the puzzles are relatively simple, and while they provide a nice break from the action, they don’t challenge players too much. The difficulty ramps up during some of the more intense sequences, especially during the combat-heavy portions, but overall, the game provides an enjoyable experience without being overwhelmingly difficult.

Final Thoughts: Tomb Raider (2013) successfully reinvents the franchise, offering a modern and more personal take on Lara Croft’s origin story. The game blends action, exploration, and survival mechanics into a thrilling adventure, with a great narrative that makes you care about Lara’s journey. Its visuals, gameplay mechanics, and immersive world design make it a standout entry in the action-adventure genre.

Pros:

Engaging story with strong character development
Beautiful graphics and immersive world design
Satisfying combat mechanics with a variety of weapons
Excellent audio and voice acting
Exploration and collectibles add depth to gameplay
Cons:

Combat can become repetitive
Some puzzles are relatively easy
Certain sections of the game feel linear
Tomb Raider (2013) is a fantastic reboot that blends classic Tomb Raider elements with modern gameplay features. It offers an emotionally engaging and thrilling adventure for players who enjoy action, exploration, and survival mechanics. Highly recommended for fans of action-adventure games and those looking to experience Lara Croft's origin story in a fresh light. | Ben tomb raider cuk seviyorum ve en sevdiğim oyunu da bu ben cok keyif alarak oynadım erkek arkadaşıma da zorla oynattım benden başka kız görmekten hoşlanmadığı için biraz zorlandı fakat bitirince cok sevdi (sevmedi) gitsin o anca cs oynasın zaten ne anlar kaliteli oyundan hıh"

So, I wasn't planning to play this game until Atlus releases remake because I heard that this is worst modern Persona game. But then I said to myself ""This can't be that bad."" and yeah, I was right. This is one of the my favorite games of all time and my second favorite Persona game (P2IS<P3R<P4G<P5R imo). Then why did I said that ""It has some major problems.""? Well, compared to P3 and P5, story feels like it is just there.

[h3] Story and Characters [/h3]

Our character is a transfer student whose parents went abroad. We will be living in little town called Inaba with our uncle and his daughter. Everything seems boring until we found out that there is a TV channel called ""Midnight Channel"" and someone is using it to murder people. So our goal is find the culprit with our beloved friend and save the day. To put it briefly this is just Scooby-Doo in Shin Megami Tensei universe. Now here is why I think story is weak aspect of this game. First of all, culprit is too easy to find. Game tries to suprise us with some plot twists (and it really worked on me at least) but these twists will not last long enough to make us believe we actually found the culprit. ""Oh we found the culprit... No it wasn't him... Oh we did it for real now... nah not really,,,"" and so on. When the right time comes we really don't have any options other than real culprit. Why? Because it can't be our friends, uncle and other fake culprits. Anyway, this part contains some major spoilers so skip this part if you haven't played game yet. [spoiler] After you caught the culprit you would think that you have completed the game but there are still some loose ends. What is Midnight Channel? Why everyone are talking about it so suddenly? Not soon after we ask these questions we will get our answers. Some random dude (or woman perhaps? idk lol) we got to speak with is actually a god. Yeah it was a ""wtf moment"" for me and not for good reason. It is a unwritten rule that every JRPG needs to have ending where you kill a god. But why it is a problem when Persona 4 does this? Because we already killed two semi-god things before this and game is already long enough. They could have just remove this part and make the culprit arc longer. Adachi is not a interesting villain to begin with and now you give us a another villain I don't care about. Just give Adachi more screentime. You know what? They actually did that in Golden. In original version of P4, Adachi didn't had any REAL social link. Now he has real social link and new ending where you can team up with him. These additions makes him more interesting if you ask me. [/spoiler] Don't get me wrong though. I love the story but it could have been better in my opinion.

Now what about characters? You probably heard that this game has the best characters in any Persona game. Well what can I say that's a fact. I said villains are boring, however main cast is so memorable. Every character fells like a real person with actual personality. Social links are also enjoyable. If you heard things like ""Kanji is gay, Naoto is trans!"" don't believe them and see with your eyes. Those people cannot read anything at all.

[h3] Gameplay and Level Design [/h3]

To quickly summarize, unfortunately, the gameplay and level design are the worst parts of this game. Dungeons are boring flat corridors. You will just want it to end quickly. Fights are fun enough to keep you going. And like any Persona game, P4G is also very easy game. Just don't expect good gameplay and you won't get disappointed. Or else play something else.

[h3] Soundtracks and Other [/h3]

I don't have much to say other than soundtracks are nothing but bangers. Atmosphere makes you fell like world is living.  There is a quiz game where you can test your knowledge about the game. Animated cutscenes are alright. 

[h3] Conclusion [/h3]

Overall, I can easily say this game is must play for JRPG/Persona fans. If you lack any friends in your life, go ahead and play this game. 60-80 hours of mostly fun content for 20 bucks. You won't regret it. | 不知道说什么好，打出真结局的那天，不停的循环Never More然后发呆
赶紧重置了让更多人玩到，让他们也感受和好朋友分别的痛苦 | [i]Persona 4 Golden[/i] es un juego que, si te lo tomás en serio, te va a dejar una marca difícil de quitar. Desde que comenzás a sumergirte en el mundo de Inaba, no solo estás jugando un JRPG más, sino que te metés en un relato cargado de emociones, giros inesperados y, lo más importante, personajes que se sienten reales. Cada social link no es solo una serie de interacciones, sino una oportunidad para entender las motivaciones, miedos y deseos de quienes te rodean. Las historias de cada uno no se sienten forzadas, al contrario, pareciera que encajan perfectamente en ese microcosmos donde te encontrás.

[b]El impacto emocional es algo que te sorprende: al principio pensás que es solo un juego, pero, cuando llegás al final, te das cuenta de que te acompañaron en un viaje personal.[/b] Esa sensación de vacío al terminarlo es algo que pocos juegos logran transmitir de manera tan efectiva. No se trata solo de lo que vivieron los personajes, sino de lo que vos viviste junto a ellos, de la conexión que lograste hacer. Te vas con la sensación de que algo realmente terminó, pero de una forma que es difícil de explicar.

Técnicamente, Persona 4 Golden es una versión optimizada para PC de la edición para PS Vita, que entre otras cosas mejora la resolución y la fluidez. Su mezcla de visual novel y dungeon crawler es única: el balance entre exploración, combate y gestión de tiempo crea una experiencia dinámica que nunca se siente repetitiva. El sistema de combate, con su mezcla de turnos y tácticas en tiempo real, es accesible pero desafiante, y [b]la música, ni hablar, es un viaje aparte[/b]... Los temas de P4G logran transmitir esa sensación de nostalgia, alegría y tristeza con una intensidad que te hace querer escuchar más y más.

En cuanto a recomendaciones; si nunca jugaste Persona 3 o Persona 5, no te preocupes, P4G tiene su propio encanto e historia independiente. Pero si estás buscando una experiencia más profunda, podrías explorar esos títulos después. [b]Tené en cuenta que el ritmo del juego puede ser lento al principio[/b], pero una vez que te enganchás, el tiempo vuela. Además, si te gusta la personalización de los personajes y la toma de decisiones, aprovechá los social links al máximo para desbloquear todo lo que el juego tiene para ofrecer.

Es un título que, por más que lo hayas jugado una vez, siempre tiene algo nuevo que mostrar, ya sea en términos de historia o de cómo gestionás tus relaciones y tu tiempo. [b]Al final, lo que queda es ese vacío, esa sensación de que parte de vos se queda con los personajes, con los recuerdos de Inaba y con todo lo que viviste.

This game is good. Not great. Not Fantastic. Not bold or new or genre-defining.
It's a 'good' game that's gotten worse since being bought by Paradox for one poignant reason:
Their pricing is outrageous. Saying this is a $20 game is a stretch but I'll bite;

The gameplay is simply two loops, one very miniature, and another bite-sized. You spin the slot machine, earn some amount of money, and you choose to add a symbol to it (or not). After a certain number of spins, you have to pay rent, get an [b]item[/b] (different from a symbol), and then the next rent payment is even higher.

Once you reach a high enough “floor”, you begin receiving essences after some of the rent payments, too. These are, at the risk of being overly simple, like temporary forms of the items, with usually greater (but time-limited) payoffs.

This is everything you do in the game.

The symbols themselves are not the most pleasing things to look at, but the thematic synergies are cute. Dwarves drink beer. With an item they can also smash ore. Billionaires synergize with wine and cheese. Divers collect aquatic type items and give permanently higher payouts after collecting them. It’s cutesy like this.

It also does a very good job at showing you with a little animation and sound effect [i]when the effect happens[/i]. I appreciate that as it’s a relatively common complaint of mine in other roguelike/lite games that these games are opaque.

What prevents me from really loving this one is the stark contrast between a run feeling completely blessed by the gods, and a complete car wreck. And the best way to go about beating the game consistently, is the least satisfying way of doing so.

The best way to go about beating the game is just simply to take whatever symbol and item best synergizes with what you have going on in your slot machine already. What this means is that playing best often means two things:

[b]1)[/b] You finish with a hodge-podge of different good symbols and items, without a unifying theme and identity.

[b]2)[/b] There’s not much looking forward to anything or building toward something.

Some runs you [i]will[/i] pick every club, spade, heart, and diamond, and you will be blessed by like 2 jokers to perfectly tie it together. But nothing you did before that moment you received the jokers helped you get them. Sometimes you’ll take every aquatic item there is, and then snag a diver who after a few rolls is already giving you 12 per spin. But again, nothing you did before that moment helped you snag the diver.

More often than not, building toward a specific synergy will result in a loss because you never get the payoff. And why would you take the payoff before you built up the base?

My personal recommendation for the game would be to have a system similar to the boons in [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/]Hades[/url]. In Hades you need certain boons before you can earn others. They don’t [b]increase[/b] your odds at getting the boon, but there is a level of satisfaction to knowing you’re building toward your goal, so to speak. And I think Luck Be a Landlord would benefit from this, even if it meant the game’s difficulty had to be increased in conjunction.

It’s not about difficulty as much as it is about satisfaction.

The other limiters are things like a collection log, a list of run modifiers to toggle, among other things. There [u]is[/u] a Steam Workshop, which I will readily admit I’ve yet to explore, but I will later. And maybe these things can be found there. In all likelihood they do exist there. And without developer effort, the workshop wouldn’t be there, and easy to use, so despite the fact the developer didn’t make the mods, they provided the framework. That deserves credit.

Ultimately though, Luck be a Landlord is limited by its core build philosophy. It’s a fine game, and has a good feel of low stakes. The price point is low, and the gameplay is simple and cute. But it’s not one I’ll really remember or recommend above many other games, although the very affordable price on sales is noteworthy!

[b]6.5/10[b] | I have been playing this for far longer than I was expecting to, and I'm about to boot it up once again. A simple roguelike, but a very well-designed one. Also, based anti-landlord and anti-capitalist politics. | Picked this game up after ProZD recommended it. It's a fun, simple deck building style game where you manipulate a slot machine. Plays well on Steam Deck. | ""У цієї гри - надзвичайно гарні відгуки. Та й тематика ігрового автомату + роуґ-лайк виглядає заманливо. Тож я вирішив спробувати. Перші враження були доволі негативними, бо це не стільки гра про ігровий автомат, скільки """"оптимізатор інтентаря"""". 

Існує велика кількість об'єктів, яка має свої властивості. Наприклад, молоко дає 1 монетку, яблуко дає 3 монетки тощо. Також існують об'єкти, які мають певну синергію між собою. Наприклад, котик дає 1 монетку, але якщо поруч з ним знаходиться молоко, то воно щезає, а гравець отримує 10 монеток. Спочатку нам дають 5 спінів і задачу заробити 25 монет. Потім - 5 спінів і задачу заробити 10 монет. І так далі до 777 монет. Після кожного спіна ми вибираємо один з трьох випадкових об'єктів. А після виконаної задачі ще отримуємо якийсь бонус. Наприклад """"Всі котики дають на 1 монету більше"""".

На словах звучить доволі непогано. Але перші 20-30 партій будуть більше дратувати, ніж розважати. Бо об'єктів - величезна кількість. Побачити загальну картину того, що з чим входить в синергію - неможливо (лише з часом потроху починає розуміти). Графіка не дозволяє легко зрозуміти різницю між багатьома об'єктами, доки не витратиш час на те, щоб вивчити їх. Гра максимально випадково видає об'єкти та бонуси. Тож навіть якщо намагаєся з самого початку вибудувати якусь синергію - великі шанси, що не вдастся. Наприклад, набрав котиків, щоб потім давати їм молоко, а молоко взагалі не випадає.

Я планував закинути гру й залишити негативний відгук. Але вирішив дати їй ще один шанс. Врешті решт розібрався. Пройшов її на перших семи чи восьми рівнях складності (потім надоїло). На останній зіграній складності дійшов до такої синергії, що за спін заробляв по 2-5 тисяч, хоча мені потрібно було набрати 10 тисяч за 10 спінів. Таким чином я заробляв більше, ніж витрачав. Досягнути такого було приємно адже у більшості партій я програвав на завданні заробити 1500. 

Це гра про удачу. Але не в тому, як ігровий автомат викидає об'єкти. А в тому, які об'єкти даються на вибір гравцю. Гравець повинен витискати максимум з тих поганих і непідходящих об'єктів, які йому були видані. Причому, в більшості випадків об'єкт краще взагалі не брати.

Гра починає розважати, коли розумієш, що у тебе є 20 ячейок """"інтентаря"""", замаскованого під ігровий автомат. Ціль - зібрати з кожної ячейки якомога більше монет, враховуючі можливі синергії. Тобто, якщо ціль - заробити 100 монет за 5 спінів, це значить, що гравець повинен за кожний спін заробляти по 20 монет. Це значить, що якщо у кожній ячейці ігрового автомата є по одному об'єкту, який генерує по 1 монетці, то ціль буде досягнута. Але гравець повинен думати наперед. Бо наступною задачею буде заробити 150 монеток за 6 спінів (25 монеток за спін). Тому потрібно заздалегідь добитися того, щоб у якихось ячейках були об'єкти, що генерують 2 монетки за хід. Або щоб були синергії, які, якщо об'єкти згенерувалися поруч, дають додаткові гроші. 

Коли таке розуміння приходить, гра стає більш цікавою, бо починаєш розуміти, що є головним. А саме - оптимізація інвентаря, а не те, як ігровий автомат виставить об'єкти на екрані.

Це специфічна гра, яка не всім сподобається, і я б не радив її своїм друзям. Але раз уже написав такий довгий відгук, то вона мене трохи зачепила. Тому загалом я її рекомендую спробувати та розібратися (особливо, якщо граєте на Steam Deck)."" | 为什么我身家几百亿了还是要交房租呢？"

It's a bizarre, beautiful blend of monster taming, base building, and surprisingly intense third-person shooter action.  The core gameplay loop revolves around befriending (and sometimes battling) a huge variety of adorable, yet potentially deadly, Pals. Daedream is my favorite companion pal – its cute looks and powerful abilities are a total game-changer!
 
My base is a testament to the game's robust building options. I've got a castle-like residential area for my Pals, a bustling factory for crafting, a relaxing Japanese hot spring where my Pals can unwind (and, let's be honest, maybe get a little romantic), and a dedicated farming zone to keep resources flowing.  It's a little slice of organized chaos, perfectly reflecting the game's spirit.
 
My combat strategy?  Pure, unadulterated pandemonium! I release my Pals, yell some words of encouragement (mostly incoherently), and hope for the best.  It's less strategy and more controlled chaos, but hey, it works more often than you'd think! 
 
The unpredictable antics of my Pals during combat are constantly hilarious.  I've seen them get stuck in the most ridiculous places, accidentally launch rockets at my own base (oops!), and generally cause more mayhem than a troop of caffeinated monkeys.  It's all part of the charm!
 
While the graphics aren't groundbreaking, and the story is fairly simple, the sheer joy of collecting, training, and battling with these adorable yet deadly creatures makes up for it.  The blend of cuteness and carnage is unique, and the base-building aspect adds a welcome layer of strategic depth.  Palworld isn't perfect – it can be repetitive at times, and the occasional glitch can be frustrating – but the overall experience is incredibly enjoyable.

It's pretty unique for a ""deck"" builder, it has a lot of variety within each Oracle, and it's very smooth/responsive. 

The art style isn't quite my thing, mostly due to some things (especially enemies) looking a bit too much like a blob of color without much depth at times due to the way the shading and outlines are done. It's good, just not my favorite style.

There are a lot of builds you can do for each Oracle, some with more risk than others, and they do genuinely feel significantly different. More impressively, most of those builds involve mechanics entirely unique to each Oracle. There's a ton of effort that, depending on how loosely you define a ""build"" as separate, results in dozens to potentially over a hundred separate builds, and there's enough overlap and synergy between them that you can mix and match without everything feeling completely useless to each other.

It sounds like a dumb complaint in a game about Dice, but I think a few of the later Oracles are a little too RNG-based. Specifically, Sothis and Austra feel very different to the other Oracles. Sothis causes your dice to trigger twice, but it only happens a certain percentage of the time. You can control that percentage to some degree, but it's an integral mechanic to him and it can be very frustrating when it works against you. Austra focuses much more heavily than other Oracles on random damage. Most of the time, aside from the deck-building elements, the only RNG is the dice rolling, so it can feel bad to play those Oracles when you're used to having fixed amounts of damage at fixed times.

The game's biggest drawback is that the endgame feels a little more lackluster than similar titles. There's tons of replayability on the Oracles and their decks - the devs really put a TON of effort into that - but the variety in enemies is much less, the variety in maps is essentially non-existent, and I would have loved to see them come up with some crazy bosses to match the crazy dice bags you can build (there are a few unique ones, but you're going to be fighting the same bosses A LOT as you start playing the game). Also, to the best of my knowledge, they haven't added Leaderboard of any kind yet, even to the Daily Runs. I would love to see some more community aspects like Leaderboards, Custom Run setups, and maybe some more tweaks to add in extra variety to each run as far as enemies/layout/bosses. | 浄化(+)と堕落（-）を上手く計算して戦っていくダイスゲーム。

良い点
・ゲームの世界観にあった音楽
このゲーム慣れていないうちと難易度を上げていくと結構悩むことが多く結構音楽を聞くことになりますが後半の音楽は結構テンション上がります。
・道中選べるダイスで自分が使いやすいデッキにカスタマイズしていくためゲーム内容がわかると意外と飽きてこない
同じキャラクターでも色んなデッキ構成が組めるので安定を捨てたハイリスクデッキで挑戦すると同じキャラなのに難易度が全然異なるので結構長く楽しめます。
・毎日変更されるデイリーゲームがあるのでいつもと違うプレイが楽しめる
ゲームクリア後に追加されるデイリーゲームが色んなMODが重なった条件でやるのでとんでもない難易度だったり逆に楽勝すぎて拍子抜けすることもあったりしますが毎日違う内容でプレイできるので飽きづらいのが良いです

悪い点
・カードゲームなどやっていないと理解しづらいシステム
浄化と堕落の基本計算に加えてプレイヤー側のダイス、道中もらえる能力と選んだキャラクターのシステム、敵側の能力とシステムの両方を理解するまでがかなり大変です。自分だけ見てるといきなり敵側の絶対堕落が発生してハートが全部消し飛ぶなんて事もあります。
・高難易度になると初動の祝福ゲーになることが多いのでリセマラをさせられる事になる
デフォルト難易度ではこんなことはありませんが難易度を最大にすると一部のキャラクターは相性の良い祝福を初動～序盤にかけて入手しないと中盤の敵にすら勝てない場合も発生するので高難易度の場合は最初の祝福を選ばせてほしいと思いました。

各キャラクター使った性能は以下の通り
ムーニィ：反転と強化でシンプルで使いやすい
セラリウス：激流貯めて殴れば基本良いだけなので楽
ヘベリウス：壊れ。コピーセンチネルにブーストダイスをコピーして再始動連打すればどの難易度でもほぼ負けない。帯電デッキもとても強いので高難易度難しいと感じたらとりあえずこいつ安定
ソティス：能力効果で確率で同じダイスを振れるがリスキーダイス再び事故も多いので最悪の事態を考えないといけないので難しめ
アウストラ：祝福のサンアイ（できればムーンアイも）取れれば後はメテオレインと天空貫通やっとけばクリアは楽勝

This is a roguelike cardgame.  Slay the Spire is the most famous of this type of game.

This game is probably something like 2nd place for roguelike cardgames, and that is pretty high praise.

That's the TLDR, here are some misc details you may find intersting:

*  This game puts pressure on you from the first fight.  It's not a game where there are a bunch of easy fights, and then a hard boss.  Every fight can kill you.  

*  At the beginning of each run, you draft a leader, one of three from huge pool that you never have complete access to.  Most of these leaders are not really very viable though.   Choose carfully!

*  There are 3 different teams to play as.  One is the sort of ""generic"" team, but it can specialize in ice, poison, or healing, among a few other minor things.    One is the ""summoner"" team and summoning is very strong because, you can tank with the summed characters.  One is the ""gnome"" team which uses gadgets and ink.  The ink is very strong because it cancels the enemy's special ability.

 | This is hard to recommend because visually it's fantastic. They nailed every artistic aspect of this game to a T, genuinely beautiful.

Wanted to get that out of the way since, as a deckbuilder, it's severely lacking, and has critical problems, major one being the difficulty. Because the way the game is designed, every encounter can end up being extremely lethal, and there can be a lot of ""checkmate"" scenarios depending on whether you got crowns, got a poor opener, or have your build counter-picked by a random pack of stage 2 enemies. 

""Oh git gud!"" the content creator that gets paid to play these games bellows! But once you do ""git gud"" it just showcases more issues, and digs into the game's 2nd biggest problem; the variety.

Some keywords are much better than others (barrage, multiple frenzy stacks), and your ideal strategy is basically a game of kingmaker where you build up 1 insanely oppressive unit and either spend resources to keep his permanence, or buff him further to hyper carry you through fights before they can get in a scratch. And nearly every ""good"" deck plays like this. Diverging into alternate wincons usually leads to a loss, and rather than trying out cool and unique interactions, you're basically taking mediocre or even bad units just as a meat shield. 

And every class aims for these same deck outlines too, reducing synergy. It's like if you have a Warrior Mage Rogue trifecta, but the most optimal way of building all 3 classes is to stack as much strength as possible, including on the Mage, and really once you figure that out it just turns into a frustrating back and forth similar to Balatro, where you're just fishing in the first stage of the game for a good opener to build your deck around. And mind you, all these issues exist on base ascension (difficulty) so the game has its difficulty frontloaded, doubly so once you realize 90% of builds and cards are terrible.

 It's really annoying coming back and forth to such a lovely looking game, being stuck with a terrible and more linear experience than just about every single other deckbuilding alternative existing on here. Try out out when it's on sale, maybe you'll like it more than I did. | Great game, I loved it - beautiful artwork, unique setting, fun game play with a unique touch to the rogue-like deck builder genre. I played it at release which I thoroughly enjoyed with some different cards and higher difficulty, and end of last year with re balancing and more content.

Even though it has less depth and variety in the genre, the mechanics feel really well. It can be hard to force a certain build, but once star aligned you feel like you're unstoppable. Still, if you don't pay attention, or think the turn through, you can still get your ass whopped. The art direction and setting give a more cutesy-happy upbeat vibe which is not only done well, but gives it a more fresh look within the genre. 

TLDR:
- Upbeat comfy art direction unique to its genre
- A slightly different take on the deckbuilder roguelike genre
- Difficult from the start - leaving a lot of opportunity to mess up. If you start playing it, don't give up on the first few hours, it'll get better and more rewarding over time.
- Rewarding and great feeling when it is the run and plays out as you planned for
- A little less variety (cards and items) and repeatability like other games within the genre. This could be a specific decision by the devs to see similar cards & items appear more often. It still offers daily challenge runs, which I personally did not use as much, but I can see the appeal for others. 

It is a high-recommended on my list if you like strategy roguelikes like Slay the Spire & Peglin, and hope to see more games like this. | Pleasantly surprised after trying crappy StS copiers over and over, regularly being disappointed.

Art is about perfect as long as cuteness doesn't bother you. They really killed it with the art and frankly I'm jealous. The style looks complicated and simple at the same time, yet still manages to have flavor that stands out. It's a great commitment to a just-right amount of detail. Each character obviously took a lot of work. Even the card design looks special, with its raised pieces and lighthearted creatures. The music has similar effect on how much it aids the game.

The gameplay's reasonably unique and avoids the mana per turn trope essentially all card games run with. Instead each card played brings every character 1 closer to attacking and using innate abilities. Each character has different timers which can be messed with. Also a 2x3 battlefield for friendly heroes. As far as depth, games like SlayTheSpire or Roguebook have more going on. But you're still going to lose sometimes as you climb up the ascension, and it's more than enough to keep you thinking for a bit about refining your deck and taking turns correctly.


A few problems:

- Animations and transitions are overly slow and waste a lot of time even if they look good.

Enemy variety is lacking. Runs still feel decently different due to deck archetypes, but overall there are probably not enough fun variables between runs.

- Card readability could be better. It's not bad, but hp/atk don't stand out enough for interpretation of the field at a glance. I can see they probably wanted to avoid going too far and making the cards less attractive.

- Grind gated grinding. You get no credit towards unlocks (cards/items/etc) before the current grind is completed. So you have to start grinds from 0 that you should have already earned. It's just adding a grind requirement before we're allowed to play the full game, and making it even more annoying than it has to. Life is short and this is a gross business practice that gets people addicted and stretches out content. Gaming is sad sometimes. Yes it's satisfying to unlock stuff, but it's obviously exploitative and wastes precious time.

- Last boss/new runs mechanics SLIGHT SPOILERS: [spoiler] You fight your previous winning deck/leader each new game. Very cool, but makes next runs harder the more cohesive your team was with no way to reset it. It makes you feel bad for playing well and having a crazy deck going, or picking up that one extra accessory. I applaud the bravery of this mechanic and enjoy it... while also being annoyed by its direct contradiction to the goal of making the best deck/leader possible. [/spoiler]

Absolutely worth my time, even if it seems to have less long-term stay than StS; no surprise. Great game. | Je l'adore, mais après avoir terminé 2 runs, je ne parviens JAMAIS a terminer le boss final...

https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43360703/ | Why did I spend so much time in this game? The gameplay loop is highly addictive. It has the 'just one more run' feel of good roguelikes. The achievements provide unique challenges. The mix of different characters and equipment makes runs feel different. Instead of a deck of cards, you upgrade a set of dice. The RNG can be grindy at times, but the UI is smooth and as I said the gameplay loop is enjoyable."

Like, i really like the concept, and would want to delve even deeper into the city-building and society concept of it, but that is a DLC that will cost me almost as much as the basegame. 

But as is, totally worth it. | ドキッ！ブースターむきむき村づくりカードゲーーーーーーーーム！

ふと思ったんですが、カードゲームの「ー（長音）」は、ひらがなとカタカナで表記が違うのかなと思ったんですが、そもそもひらがなに長音表記は無いのでした。だからひらがなで書くと「かあどげえむ」となっちゃうんですね。何とも気が抜けた文字ですね。

さて、開発元のSokpopは、２０１７年から現在まで、かれこれ１００タイトルを超えるゲームをリリースして来ました。知りませんでした。それも翻訳が必要だと思う様なゲームには大体日本語が対応してますし、複雑で不便な日本語を忠実に再現出来ていて、このSokpopという方々は何者なんだと思いまして、ホームページを見に行きましたところ、メンバー最年長のtijmenさんがバク転してました。爽やかで結構。

そのゲームタイトルの中でも一番売れているというこのStacklandsは、見ての通りのカードゲームですが、食料の概念が有りまして、村人が増えれば出来る作業が増えるけれども、食料が足りなくなるので、食料生産の自動化をして、やってるうちに敵が攻めて来て、ハンマーやつるはしを剣と盾に持ち替えて、戦って、死んで、やったー食料が減らないから一人でいいや、何だっけこの宝箱、何だミミックか、よし全滅。というゲームです。

親切にクエストが組まれていて、最後までストレス無く変化に富んだサバイバル生活が楽しめるので、ライト勢にもオススメですし、かあどげえむ・ぼおどげえむが元々好きな方でもハマると思います。ブースターを剥く時のワクワクがここにあります。

Sokpopは他のゲームもワンアイデアが盛り込まれたちょっとイイじゃんっていう物が多い様に見えます。ホームページにPatreon.c0mへのリンクがデカデカと掲載されていましたので、飛んでみましたところ、４０００人以上の会員様がいらっしゃってこれだけで約６０００ドル／月という支援を受けており、その資金を使って更に毎月新しいゲームを開発して会員やSteamユーザーはニコニコ、開発者はバク転しているという好循環を生み出しています。

靴下マークのオランダ人４人組Sokpop。ちょっと好きになりました。実績が全部靴下なのは勘弁して下さい。 | 神殿に聖杯を捧げたらストーリー進むと思うじゃないですか！！！！！！！！！！！！！！ | The game has an interesting style for those who like resource management and city build. Unfortunately my review is negative because I tend to gather many resources, and the game becomes unmanageable when this happens, partially because the board size is smaller than the necessary, partially because new resources are not smartly grouped (they can be initially, but not for the long run). and then you start to focus more on the board management than the actual gameplay. My feeling is that the mechanic right now should be a beta version, and the true game should still be better polished before a true release. I do believe if the dev works in these improvements, the game may be a recommended one, but not right now. It`s also sad that the dev prioritized to launch new payable content than the basics of his/her game, which is a feedback for quite some time if you check some negative reviews | 还蛮有创意的卡牌经营游戏 唯二不足就是玩到后期卡牌堆满一屏幕有点看不过来，前期开怪出来会有点难打  但素真的很好玩！"

Being forced to play thru large levels where the end boss usually is something that summons 4 badgers with 84 health and 16 attack when your pulling a max of 32 atk...

I know its ""Grind and get stuff to get better!"" but its such a slow process its aggravating, and nothing so far made me go yay this is awesome to have. Treasures in short supply so building progress is sloooow, guess your supposed to just give the mail guy all your stuff and go die on the next floor or something and repeat that 10-15 times. Just let us leave.

Ran into a bunch of glitches and things unexplained that made me lose stuff (like retry just resets all progress back to the start of the entire area, not the battle, not the floor, everything, it was like... could I get a warning? Also went on a quest that said progress in the town would not proceed, assumed ""no new items unlocked"" nope... it just negates the entire run, no items brought back no nadda. Runs take forever too, and barely give you stuff. Specially if your trying to win, and fail, which you will, and it just deletes everything from your backpack. | The game use to be fun, but everything fun has been nerfed to the point it is boring.

The campaign progression is very slow and boring. the game mode does not even seem to add anything. Just a way to waste your time.

Quick play has such high item bloat that it is hard to get a build you want at all going. You can have multiple runs in a row without seeing a single structure, a bow and arrow, etc at all. But you will keep seeing a few of the same boring items you never want to appear every game.

Boss relics are just not fun anymore. They all have bad downsides and require specific builds to work. So you often do not even pick up a single boss relic. I think they were aiming for a slay the spire style boss relics without understanding them at all (the downsides were minor compared to the power given and STS did not try to balance things like this game).

So I guess this is a game that just changed from 1 8/10 game to a 3/10 for me.

 | Pretty fun game with lot of replayability

Pro
Replayability good thing for a roguelite each run will be different due to the item, character and challenge you choose
Fun little story with lot of tutorial to introduce the different mechanic
Easy mod support integrate with steam workshop to add even more replayability

Con
RNG dependant making some run at best boring at worst plain not fun | A couple of bugs still, with the major ones being: save files being deleted or keep loading at the same checkpoint over and over again like with my save file. Please don't put your hours in it like I did this weekend ;) The concept is good, a finished version 2.0 would be preferable. | I seriously went back and forth on this. There are aspects of this game that I [u]really[/u] like. The concept of sorting your backpack in a combative scenario and defeating enemies with strategic item placement is really great. The main character and the first unlockable character are fantastic fun*. However, there are numerable UI issues and item description issues that make learning how to play the game very unpleasant. Certain items are not straightforward and there seems to be no info online on how to use them or even what they are. This game is just over a year old and it's clear the Dev(s) care about this game as it receives regular updates. Yet for some reason, major game-breaking bugs still exist. 
So, I touched on the fun of this game. I want to make it clear that I mostly enjoyed playing this game. I have almost 50 hours in this game, I definitely have enjoyed it. But the learning curve of this game is steep. The way and pace at which things are unlocked are not well done, imo. I'm not sure what the intended method of play is, because there is no real info about that. The game throws you in the deep end, expecting you to figure out how to set up amazing engines of play. The quests give you great hints, don't get me wrong, but if you didn't think to do the quests (cus all the quests are optional) then wow. 

TLDR: There are many features of this game that I really enjoy. There are too many features of this game that I don't enjoy. Therefore, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to a new player unless they are willing to learn about this game before they play it. Fun game, but can be incredibly punishing."

Cobalt Core carves out its own niche in the roguelike genre with a fresh approach to gameplay and mechanics. It’s a game that emphasizes strategic ship movement and the precise use of cards, creating tense and rewarding encounters that set it apart from the crowd.

The core gameplay shines with its focus on positioning and timing. Each move feels meaningful, and the balance between ship maneuvering and card usage adds a layer of strategy that keeps every run engaging. The length of each run is just right, avoiding the fatigue of overly long sessions while still offering a satisfying sense of progression.

One of the standout features is the lighthearted and charming cast of characters. Their short, meaningful conversations drive the story forward without bogging down the pace—a perfect fit for a roguelike game. The narrative elements provide just enough depth to make you care about the world and its inhabitants while keeping the focus on gameplay.

Visually, Cobalt Core is a treat. The 2D pixel art style is beautifully crafted, with vibrant colors and detailed designs that enhance the overall experience. The audio complements the visuals well, with a solid soundtrack and sound effects that add to the atmosphere without overwhelming the player.

While the game’s design is top-tier, its one notable flaw is the requirement to repeat runs to unlock additional content. This repetition can feel a bit tedious at times, especially for players who prefer more variety in their progression. However, the engaging mechanics and overall quality of the game help mitigate this issue.

Cobalt Core is a standout entry in the roguelike card game genre, offering a unique blend of strategy, charm, and polish. Its innovative mechanics, memorable characters, and beautiful presentation make it a must-play for fans of the genre. Despite some minor repetition, the game’s overall design and execution are top-notch, delivering an experience that’s as enjoyable as it is rewarding. | I played this game a few times and didn't understand how to play. I kept dying. But then I figured out that movement points don't need to be spent that turn. You can click on a movement card and save the movement points for a different turn. Game became much easier once I figured that out. 

And now I understand why it's one of the highest rated games on Steam. Lots of fun. | I Loved FTL back in the day, played a few rougelikes that scratched that itch since then, Crying Suns was the best for the Space ship thing but gameplay was certainly different,I  loved the setting/story. Recently Peglin really got it's hooks in me with the deck (ball) building. 
Cobalt Core's feels like the perfect mix of FTL's ship gameplay (though different), Peglin's Deck building type upgrade (but actually cards), and Crying Suns setting/story (but make it cute instead of oppressing grim dark). 
It's really got me and really scratches that FTL itch!

And Riggs is the best by the way..."

76561198082086866,368260,Marvel's Midnight Suns,13.133333333333333,"RPG, Strategy",6,"Dude this game would've skyrocketed if it wasn't for some questionable design choices and questionable marketing. I love the game but the weird middle-school ""drama"" and increasing friend levels (weird hangouts and trying to please people) was awkward. I'm all for cheesy comic book dialogue from the golden era but let's be real, I really wish it was darker in tone. It's ""dark"" in the sense that it has that late 90s-early 2000s edgy angst. It's like watching Blade but they took out the cursing and blood.

Let's be real, people were expecting Xcom with Marvel characters. Straight up, bringing in Marvel characters on a tactical map and playing a polished version of Freedom Force mixed with turn-based action and stellar graphics. It's definitely unique and works with what it's got, I almost wish it played like a rogue-lite. And dude, we should've gotten some more obscure characters but I know that doesn't pull in the masses.

That's it for my gripes. This game is addicting and we're kinda strapped for good superhero games, especially ones that let you control a squad of your favorites. Aside from the ""hub"" slowing down the action, I really love it. Graphics are slick, superheroes can feel powerful if you build the right deck, and though we still have the Avengers in it, it's not just about them and we get to play with characters who deserve a bit more spotlight. Despite what I feel about the tone of the story, I still think it's pretty solid for a superhero game. Throwing some goon into an explosion to wreck other badguys and then slamming down with some crazy AOE attack you've been saving your points for is insanely satisfying. Also, it has Ghost Rider. That was enough to make me buy it right there.

If you picked it up for PC, seriously look into modding as there are some tweaks out there that make the game feel more streamlined. | This game really took me by surprise. Its existence nearly passed me by when it launched in late 2022.

Little did I know: Firaxis Games and the XCOM team had just made a Marvel XCOM Mass Effect Card Battler.

WHAT?

I don't normally click with card battlers, and I am very burned out on superhero multimedia, but Midnight Suns quickly got its hooks in me, and I could not put it down. Maybe I'm just burned out on trash multimedia.

- If you like Marvel content, that's an easy reason to enjoy this. There's a good mix of superstar Avengers heroes and lesser known Midnight Suns heroes in the game.

- All of this game's DNA screams XCOM, the battles have just been converted to a smaller arena based around card battling, rather than a large cover and fog of war-based combat system. All of the management systems at play in your out of combat base, The Abbey, are very similar to XCOM headquarters. Train with your heroes, upgrade your cards, buy items, explore the Abbey grounds to find secrets and loot, and quite a bit more in-between combat missions.

- A friendship and hangout Social system with all of the heroes. Have some beers with Blade or go fishing with Wolverine, and you get battle bonuses for building these relationships, creating a great side progression system.

- I honestly don't play enough card battlers to give an expert gamer opinion on how deep the card strategy and deckbuilding is. But I started the game pretty inept, and by the end I was fine-tuning my hero decks, playing cards for a turn or two ahead, and optimizing my combat action sequences for maximum effect.

- The one DLC expansion that came out before development ended, The Good, The Bad, and the Undead, was just as high quality as the base game and integrated into it seamlessly. It was also amazing near the end when Morbius screamed ""ITS MORBIN' TIME""

- This has a LOT of dialogue, in a dialogue system that will be familiar if you've played the Mass Effect trilogy. The writing is never that good, in fact it can be quite comic book hammy at times, but this game is suitably epic. I accomplished a lot, but did NOT ""100%"" this game, and this was teetering on 90 hours played. That's bigger than the entire Mass Effect trilogy on completionist runs.

Some smaller criticisms of the game that I didn't love:

- They tried to go for a premium currency and loot grading system that just reeks in a single player game. Unacceptable. Alas, development of the game has ceased, and the Legendary Edition of this game includes ALL content.

- Some of the mission variety, particularly Story missions (move critical path/plot forward), left a bit to be desired. I never minded General missions (mostly side/optional missions) having recognisable presets, but to launch into Story missions and often have them padded out by the same presets as General missions was disappointing at times.

- Not a big fan of level scaling enemies, and the enemies in this game will do so until you reach max ""normal"" levels, after which there are ""heroic"" levels where you begin to eclipse them. This almost felt like an irrelevance to explain, but I was just shy of max level after finishing the game, so enemies scaled for my whole playthrough.

- That this game fell under the radar so hard, I never got more DLC expansions. We could have had Thor! And Squirrel Girl!

That's about it. I strongly recommend this game. If ""Marvel XCOM Mass Effect Card Battler"" speaks to you at all, you need to try this. | This game is the closest you can ever get to perfecting the formula of great companion characters.  The cast is the best part of this game, and anyone who says the Relationship building sucks doesn't know what they're talking about.  Each character is written both exactly as you'd expect, and with such a depth that it builds upon that legacy.  It's really fun to be able to leave your mark on the Marvel universe, and make friends and allies with some of the biggest names, cast in the best way.  

I originally wasn't into the Card Game idea, but I really came around to it.  It's really cool to play through them like combat puzzles, with plenty of opportunities for defenestration and environmental damage.  Each hero's card-set is so well designed that they all play a little different, allowing for strategic and flavorful combination.  I haven't played a Marvel game that utilized it's characters so well since Marvel Ultimate Alliance.  

The story is pretty good, but pretty much what you'd expect from a comic book event series.  Think about any of the comic events, these are the vibes.  Characters are transformed and die in interesting ways, that'll certainly be undone by some sort of cosmic force, it's kinda the name of the game here.  What it is, though, is a very fun thrill ride.  Lots of little twists and turns, and the level of dialogue choice can really make your experience *yours*.  

The DLC is pretty worth, I even enjoyed Deadpool, he wasn't annoying and had a really fun play style.  Game is super good, underrated even, especially from the X-Com devs.  Masters of the Strategy genre for sure, they can turn a silly card game gimmick into a really fun tactical puzzle game. 

TL;DR: You want a Marvel RPG with a fun Tactical Card Gimmick and solid representation across the Marvel Universe?  Get this game. | 是挺好玩的，依旧是漫威个人英雄主义风格，华丽的招式和特效，英雄出任务的动画以及剧情过程中的配乐非常不错，让人跟着激动。但是怪的种类较少和过多没有用的对话文本使游戏变得枯燥。尤其结局仓促的剧情让玩家的情感就像做爱一样还没达到高潮就匆匆结束了，和美剧一样虎头蛇尾。 | Loved this game, didn't think I'd be into the turn-based/deck building aspects of the game, but in practice it's actually pretty fun and engaging, feels like you're playing a weird game of chess and the pieces are replaced with some of your favorite marvel heroes. This was my first experience with this style gameplay, and since then I've also acquired other similar titles like the XCOM franchise. This game is a great introduction into these types of games. On lower difficulties it can be a great laid back and story-rich experience, I'd often plan out my next moves while having a movie or something playing on another monitor without too much distraction to either activity. Can be a satisfying challenge on higher difficulties as well, enemies turn you into glass but it makes you have to prioritize strategising turns ahead and using different card combos you might not need to bother with in the early game. The gameplay itself isn't reinventing the wheel but the story and more specifically the character interactions are so compelling and does a good job of making you feel like YOU are a part of the team, on par with the square enix guardians of the galaxy game if not better. Hoping for a sequel, if you're skeptical wait for a sale but I'd say this is a comfortable pickup at any price. The DLC is definitely worth it as well, I enjoyed the game on release before the DLCs dropped and enjoyed the game then, but now the game doesn't feel like a complete package without it."
76561198082086866,2231450,Pizza Tower,4.833333333333333,"Action, Indie",5,"The game has a lovely, unique art-style that gives it a lot of personality. While most of the levels aren't too tough, some of the bosses took me a long time. | divertido, frenético, desafiador e claro, muito bem animado e com um estilo de arte único. com certeza um dos melhores jogos de plataforma que eu já joguei! 

PIZZA TIME! | pizza tower is a great game. the gameplay is so smooth, every movement feels right. its wacky and cartoonish artstyle is one of the best things about the game, everything looks like it was from a 90's cartoon. the musics brilliant  and every track fits the level, i could listen to the ost all day its that good. all in all, this games great and is everything you'd want in a platformer and i'd recommend this game to anybody. | I thought I would like this game, I wanted to like this game, but I didn’t like this game and I don’t really think it’s the game’s fault I didn’t like it.

 The main thing was that there were two separate incentives to the game that were at odds with each other that just really stopped the game from ‘clicking’ for me. All of the mechanics seemed to be designed to push the player to go fast and reckless to push the combo meter as high as they could (and it was more fun to play that way). However, all the rewards seemed to more heavily incentivize being slow and methodical, checking every corner for secrets. In fact, much of the progression was linked to exploring a level thoroughly to find certain key items and I had difficulty enjoying the slow search when every fiber of my being just wanted to crash through everything.

The humor also didn’t really “click” for me. I know there are people out there who really enjoy some random chaos, but for me it felt like I was playing in the vibe of a joke without a punchline.

Overall, I think this game accomplishes what it set out to do and I can see why a lot of people enjoy it, but I really wish I had thought more deeply about whether this was actually a game for me before getting swept along in the hype. | Es todo un hito. Es un juego con aire retro, pero super actual. Estética única que nos resuena a los noventeros, muy bien construído y con mucha rejugabilidad. Re divertido. Te cag#s de risa.

BN3's post game is what made me amazed at how well the game was put together. There was just SO MUCH to collect to finish your chip collection, and all the hidden goodies along the way. I mean the story is standard megaman.
The multiplayer is also was i was hooked on back then too. Maybe i'll get around to finishing the chip completion and facing people online one day, but until then, i don't want to be at a disadvantage. Great game. Thanks for bringing these gems to steam."
76561198082086866,1798020,Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection Vol. 2,0.0,"Action, RPG",0,"[h1] 록맨에그제 4,5,6 시리즈 합본판 [/h1]

ROCKMAN EXE ADVANCED COLLECTION Vol.2 는 록맨에그제 4 레드선, 블루문, 록맨에그제 5 팀 오브 커넬, 팀 오브 브루스, 록맨에그제 6 전뇌수 그레이거, 전뇌수 페르저 이 6개의 타이틀을 합한 합본판이다. 합본판 게임에는 각 타이틀 별 bgm들을 다 들을 수 있고, 통신대전이나, 이벤트카드, 특수기가칩들을 다 사용할 수 있다. 지난 평가에서도 적었긴 하지만, 이 록맨 타이틀은 다른 록맨 타이틀과는 다르게 오히려 스토리에 더 기반을 둔 게임이라 스토리를 오히려 중요시하는 사람들에게는 괜찮은 게임이라고 생각한다. (단 이 게임은 한글 미지원이고, 타이틀별 번역이 이루어지는걸로 알고 있는데 진행이 어디까지 됐는지는 잘 모르겠다.)

전투는 덱빌딩 RPG답게, 칩 30개를 적절히 조합하여 자신만의 덱을 만들고 턴제 전투를 진행하면된다. 턴제 전투는 칩을 사용하여 록맨을 강화하거나 무기들을 사용할 수 있고, 힐이나 필드 변화도 시킬 수 있다. 그리고 록맨에그제 2,3편과는 다르게 4,5,6,에서는 다른 시스템이 추가 되는데, 4,5,에서는 소울 유니즌, 6에서는 크로스 소울과 비스트화가 추가 되어 덱 빌딩 전투에 다른 전략 요소를 느낄 수 있다.

사실 이 게임을 구매한 제일 큰 이유는 록맨에그제 6 타이틀 때문인데, 어렸을 때 4,5는 즐겨봤는데 6만 유일하게 못 즐겼기 떄문이다. 
4편의 경우는 토너먼트에 참여하는 넷토의 이야기를 다루고, 5편의 경우는 네뷸라의 활동을 저지하고 해방하기 위한 리버레이트 미션에 대한 이야기, 그리고 6편의 경우 이사한 넷토와 전뇌수간의 이야기를 다룬다. 4편의 경우는 그런데 거의 스토리가 없는 내용이고 마지막 엔딩에 갑작 스럽게 내용이 추가된 내용이라 스토리는 제일 꽝이었고, 5,6편은 그나마 스토리가  볼만했었다. 그리고 6편의 경우 시리즈의 최종 완결도 볼 수 있어 지금까지 즐겼던 록맨에그제 시리즈의 마무리를 볼 수 있어서 정말 좋았다.

의리로 산 에그제 게임인데 6 하나만으로 만족한 게임이었다.
오래된 게임이긴 하지만, 스토리도 빵빵하고 괜찮으므로 지금까지와는 색다른 록맨을 경험하고 싶은 분들에게 추천한다.

이렇게 까지 말해놓고 비추를 준 이유는... 필자의 스팀덱에서 실행이 안됐기 때문..... 
스팀덱 유저들 중에 실행이 되는 분들이 있고 안되는 분들이 있는 것  같은데 본인은 실행이 안되었다. 그래서 빈정상해서 비추를 준다... 스팀덱 유저는 이 점 참고하길 바란다.

아 그리고 도전과제를 위한 사람이라면, 팬이 아닌 이상 플레이하지 않는 것을 추천한다. 이유는....
[b] 전 타이틀 합쳐서 총 10회차를 진행해야한다.[/b]

에그제 4 타이틀 각각 3회차 씩 총 6회차. 5,6는 각 타이틀 1회차씩 총 10회차이다.
이놈들이 4에서 미쳐버려가지고 모든 소울을 1회차에 못 얻게 만들었을 뿐더러, 모든 스탠다드칩도 2회차 이상해야 얻을 수 있게 만들었기 때문에 도전과제 100%를 원한다면 엄청난 여정이 될거기 때문에 비추를 하는 편. 물론 버스터 맥스 옵션이 있어서 편하게 할 수 있긴한데 같은 게임 6회차 돌면 정신 나가버린다. 스탠다드칩은 2회차에자신의 라이브러리에 없는 배틀칩을 뽑아내는 뽑기 기계가 해금이 되기 때문에 이론상 2회차에서 스탠다드칩 올컴플릿이 가능하다.

에그제 5는 무난한 난이도라 빡세지 않은데,  6은 조금 빡세다. 모든 컨텐츠를 할 필요는 없지만 꽤나 많은 파고들기 요소를 해야하기 때문에 피곤할 수 있다 (단 1회차만 그렇게 하면 된다). 
전체적으로 신경쓸게 많기 때문에 편하게 도전과제 작업을 하고 싶어하는 유저들에게는 비추하는 바이다. | The nostalgia is real!
Played the series for a few years in my childhood, barely understanding anything I'm doing. Just enjoying myself.
Now I understand the true depth of those games and having a blast!

Oh, and the story (except the 4th game) is amazing :D | 過去作がティーン向けだったことや、当時のゲームスピードに合っていた点は理解できます。しかし、ゲームデザインの磨き込みがそのままのため、現在の視点で見ると不便に感じる部分が多くありました。例えば、エンカウントのオン・オフ機能やエンカウント率の調整、ミニゲームのスキップなどの救済措置が欲しかったです。

救済措置として「バスターMAX」がありますが、チップやメモリの一括開放、収集要素のスキップ、取り逃した要素の検索など、極端に言えばデバッグツールのような機能があれば、より快適にプレイできたと思います。GBA時代のゲーム特有の「ボリューム調整」のための仕掛けが、現代ではストレスに感じることが多く、マップのショートカットや一部の無駄な迂回路を削減する改善があってもよかったのではないでしょうか。特に「削岩機ステージのイライラ棒」や「百人斬り」のようなミニゲームはスキップしたかったです。

また、目的地まで遠回りさせるマップ設計の中で、何度もランダムエンカウントが発生するのは大きなストレスでした。一方で、戦闘システム自体は非常に評価できます。ただ、自分の理想のデッキが組めるのは終盤になるため、コンボやプログラムアドバンスを狙うよりも、バスターMAXで連射して素早く終わらせるほうがストレスが少なかったです。結果として「懐かしさを消化する」ぐらいのプレイ感になりました。

発売後しばらく経ってしまったのでアップデートは期待していませんが、このゲームをリリースしてくれたこと自体感謝しています。ありがとうございます | Its a good collection. If youre into GBA styled RPG  games, its a good purchase. | megmn"

First of all, I’m so glad this isn’t another game where you just play as Harry Potter. Instead, you get to create your own character and fully experience the world of Hogwarts. That alone made it worth playing for me.  

 [h2]Gameplay[/h2]
The developers clearly put a lot of love into this game, and it shows. [b]Hogwarts Castle[/b] is absolutely stunning so much so that it actually made me tear up at times. Everything feels alive, from NPCs casually using magic to paint pictures or prank each other to weird potion experiments happening in the bathrooms. I could spend hours just listening to NPC conversations.  

The game has three main areas:  
- [b]Hogwarts Castle[/b] – Easily the best part of the game, full of detail, personality, and magic everywhere.  
- [b]Hogsmeade[/b] – A charming, lively village that’s fun to explore and next to the castle.
- [b]The Open World[/b] – This was hit-or-miss for me. It has some interesting moments, but compared to Hogwarts, it feels less polished and emptier. It honestly felt like two different teams worked on these areas—the castle is [b]bursting with life[/b], while the open world feels [b]weaker in quality[/b]. Most collectibles and side quests take place in the open world, which was fine, but I personally would’ve loved more focus on the castle itself.  

That said, side missions were actually fun and never felt like a chore. The Forbidden Forest, while well-designed, didn’t feel as scary as I imagined it would be.  
This game also has [b]a ton[/b] of collectibles and optional content for 100% completion. Unfortunately, three of the achievements require replaying the game three times up to a certain point, which felt like a grind and should honestly be removed.  
Spiders. Spiders everywhere. Every five minutes, the game throws you into another cave full of horrifying spiders. Thankfully, the devs included an [b]Arachnophobia Mode[/b] for those who can’t handle them.  

[h2]Combat[/h2]
I’m absolutely in love with the combat. It’s even better on Hard difficulty, but Normal strikes a great balance between fun and challenge. Honestly, this game has ruined traditional mage/wizard combat for me nothing else feels as good after playing this. The spell combos, dodging, and enemy variety make every fight feel pretty dynamic.  
Although opinions on this are mixed, I personally really vibed with it.

[h2] Story[/h2]
The story was [b]okay[/b] nothing special. It’s your typical ""kill the bad guy to save the world"" kind of plot. The side quests and relationship quests were way more engaging than the main story, and I actually found myself more invested in those.  

[h2]❌ Cons[/h2]

- [b]Major Lighting Issues in Interior Areas [/b] :
(As of new update on January 30th 2025)
Many caves and rooms are blindingly bright, like a flashbang directly to the eyes—completely white screens that are painful to look at. If you have epilepsy, be careful. This is a weird bug since these areas are fully enclosed with no sunlight source, but the moment you step into certain spots, it’s like staring directly into the sun.

- [b]Performance Issues[/b] : 
I’m running this game on an RTX 4060 at 1440p, and while it looks great, it has some serious issues:  

[b]Texture Pop-in / Loading Issues[/b] – My biggest complaint. This is a well-known PC bug that happens even on the lowest settings. NPCs, grass, and objects suddenly pop into existence right in front of you, completely ruining immersion. What’s frustrating is that the game used to run way better at launch, but the last update (around six months ago) broke a lot of things, and they never fixed it.  
Some examples of texture pop-in issues:  
- NPCs suddenly appearing a few steps away when I turn the camera.  
- Half-invisible cows in Hogsmeade.  
- Grass abruptly loading every time the camera angle changes during a conversation or cutscene.  
- Even opening the menu and returning to the game makes textures freak out.  
>[b]Edit[/b] : As of the new update on 30th January texture pop in issues is mostly fixed, its still here and there but nothing immersion breaking.

[b]Ray Tracing is a Mess[/b] – Turning on RT causes micro-stutters and makes texture pop-in even worse. It’s simply not worth using in this game currently, it used to be way better before.
>[b]Edit[/b] : As of the new update on 30th January, they added ray reconstruction, DLSS 4 to this game. RT performance is a bit better but its still a mess in open world areas.

[b]Winter Season FPS Drops[/b] – For some reason, when it snows, my FPS gets cut in half. It’s a massive bummer because winter in Hogwarts should feel magical, but instead, it just lags.  (I have not checked this in the new update)

- [b]Low Replayability[/b] – While each house has an exclusive quest, replaying the whole game just for one extra mission isn’t very appealing. However, the upcoming PC modding update should help with this issue.  I'm honestly depressed this game is over I want to experience it more :(
>[b]Edit[/b] : New mod update did not help with this but there's rumours about them adding possible new story content to the game, nothing concrete tho.

If they ever fix these issues, this game would be so much more enjoyable.  

[h2]Final Thoughts[/h2]
I just want to thank the devs for creating such an amazing game. It was one of the best gaming experiences I’ve had. Despite its flaws, I still highly recommend it. This game is worth picking up at full price and even more so at a discount! | 一款瑕不掩瑜但平平无奇的作品。说它瑕不掩瑜，因为本作就是哈利波特IP下最优秀最还原的作品之一，仅凭这一亮点就足以掩盖种种问题。说它平平无奇，因为本作从玩法，到小怪、boss、机制、剧情、细节打磨，方方面面不是普普通通，就是存在不足。可以看出制作组有下功夫加入很多内容，但最终游玩的体验却是有些不尽如人意。总的来说，哈利波特系列的粉丝推荐入手，毕竟是IP下最优秀的游戏之一，但如果对系列无感，推荐观望等骨折再考虑入手，因为没有粉丝属性加持，而本作的游戏性并不顶尖。

[h3] 设定 [/h3]
不用多说，本作最大的优点之一。哈利波特系列有数不尽的粉丝，本作也确实称得上这一IP下最优秀的那一档游戏。虽然说有些流水线味道，但足够庞大的地图和填充的超量内容也还算得上是最还原的游戏了。遗憾的是，抛开背景设定的优势，本作剩下的亮点就不多了。

[h3] 美术 [/h3]
优点。很多建筑、地形的设计本身就颇具魔法世界的味道，再加上近几年新游戏的画质提升，可以说游戏的美术挺有表现力的。

[h3] 玩法 [/h3]
经典的主线任务+大量支线任务+地图满地开宝箱捡装备的流水线设计。做任务学新咒语，做任务升级，做任务推剧情，基本上是经典罐头开放世界的老一套了。主要的问题还是等级机制带来的数值不平衡。尽管我已经在满地跑腿开地图的时候做了一点支线，但是打到主线大boss兰洛克的时候还是被他压了好几级。这本身并不是什么问题，无非就是boss血量厚一点，我伤害低一点，但是配合上战斗系统的缺陷，就让这种数值上的问题给人较差的体验（这部分会在战斗系统里讨论）。
此外，同样是等级机制，敌人的等级本身我觉得也是设计有问题的。既然制作组在设置中已经提供了几个不同的难度选项，就没必要在敌人等级上动手脚了，完全可以把boss等级下调5级然后填和现在完全一样的数值，这完全不会对游玩难度有任何影响。因此，我只能认为，故意把boss等级设置成高于玩家好几级，配合那个一直跳出来的“等级高于你的敌人威胁较大”的提示，是单纯为了鼓励玩家做支线任务升级的拖时间设计，让我有点反感。我觉得制作组自己对于自己设计的支线任务都没有信心，如果支线任务真的趣味十足，或者剧情引人入胜，玩家自然会有探索的动力，为什么需要拉高boss的等级来“诱骗”玩家去做支线升级呢？
总的来说，玩法中规中矩，不好不差，是经典的罐头开放世界，但是在优秀的大作满天飞的时代，没有创新且给人的体验仅仅及格，就是缺点。

[h3] 战斗系统和小怪设计 [/h3]
本作最大的毒点之一，也是支撑我连夜打完主线后一定要发评测抨击的主要动力。
声明一下，我全程游玩的是一般难度，是除了最难以外第二难的选项，如果最高难度下一些细节有所不同请见谅。不过我觉得在一般难度下已经存在了大量问题，数值和机制都有，我并不认为游玩最高难度能有所改善。此外我全程没有用三种不可饶恕咒，这可能是感觉伤害略显刮痧的原因之一。但一款背靠哈利波特这个超级IP的游戏，不当黑巫师不猛猛Crucio Imperio 啃大瓜就会伤害不足，是有点影响体验的，毕竟原作最终击败伏地魔都没用上不可饶恕咒。
具体聊一下细节。
首先就是设计上毫无创新和诚意。铁甲咒是格挡，在合适的时机使用铁甲咒会自动打一发昏迷咒，也就是弹反。也缝合了潜行玩法，可以用幻身咒潜行，用全身束縛咒背刺秒怪。剩下的咒语就是各种各样的控制或者伤害。恕我直言，这种战斗方式完全就是从现有的成熟框架里抄的，只是换成了魔法世界的咒语名字，可以说是十分甚至九分的一致。
然而借鉴缝合了不少东西并没有带来更好的体验。主线敌人中潜行玩法大部分时候也就是每个场景偷袭最外侧的三五个小怪，后期中央区域成堆的小怪和交叉视野，想要靠潜行背刺清理，需要用吸引注意力然后逐个击破的方式搞很久。而如果选择直接冲进去开无双，也完全没有割草游戏的爽快，只有打一地血牛的疲惫。正如前文所提到，由于等级机制的存在，很可能小怪肉的一批而玩家的伤害感人，然而小怪的攻击又几乎没有威胁和变数，所有攻击最终都分为两种：能弹反的弹反，不能弹反的翻滚闪避。于是战斗环节，玩家就是站在怪堆里，翻来覆去地弹反翻滚开技能普攻（以及使用消耗道具），键盘按的手疼终于打完一波，空中红光一闪，又来了一地血牛。
小怪的设计也是颇为匮乏和同质化。本身在主线流程里，主要的敌人就只有黑巫师、妖精、蜘蛛等几类，搞笑的是每类敌人基本上只需要分成近战和远程敌人，能弹反的和必须闪避的敌人，除此以外，他们对玩家的战斗体验几乎不会带来任何区别。黑巫师可以远程施放咒语或者召唤阴尸近战，妖精有近战妖精和远程妖精，蜘蛛可以近战攻击或者远程吐毒液或丝，不管是黑巫师还是妖精蜘蛛都是一次来一窝，近战远程混搭，我请问这在体验方面能带来任何区别吗？
当然，制作组也给每种敌人加了一个弱点，会有一定伤害加成，但几乎被等级机制带来的数值问题掩盖住了。在游玩过程中我不知道多少次见到全身着火的蜘蛛或者阴尸对我发起不断的进攻，说好的怕火呢？哦，原来是血条太长没烧死，可真是太有设计了。
显然，设计师学习借鉴缝合了很多东西，但是最终他们也没想明白自己战斗系统的主要基调是什么。小怪数量多，血条厚，同质化严重，伤害感人（几乎不具备秒杀玩家的能力，即使玩家失误挨揍了，只要有治疗药就可以一直不死），带来的就是长时间高度一致、无聊且磨叽的战斗感受，既没有那些高难度动作游戏刀尖起舞的紧张感，也没有无双割草游戏风卷残云般横扫千军的爽快感。

[h3] boss和机制设计 [/h3]
boss战和机制设计更是拉了一坨特大的。极度匮乏的机制数量和毫无想象力的设计，让整个战斗系统就像一个笑话。
打完大boss兰洛克后，我突然意识到，其实在前两三个小时我竟然就已经体验完了制作组设计的全部战斗机制。在非常早期，玩家学会了应该如何击破敌人的护盾：用对应颜色的咒语攻击该颜色的护盾。玩家也学会了使用古代魔法从地上捡石头或炸药桶扔到敌人身上打伤害。于是，在兰洛克boss战中，我们要做的，就是用对应颜色的咒语攻击boss召唤的护盾，用古代魔法把boss扔过来的红色子弹扔回去，以及能弹反的弹反，不能弹反的闪避。兰洛克会采取的行动一共只有五六种，一种可以弹反，一种可以扔回去，一种是召唤护盾，剩下两三种无脑翻滚闪避。这就是制作组精心设计的主线大boss，真是太有设计感了。
前文也提到了，在等级机制的加持下，boss血量较多而玩家伤害一般，又由于兰洛克本身攻击方式的威胁一般，又没什么变数，完全就是公式化循环，因此boss战也和小怪战体验高度相似：同质化和磨叽。boss血条长，玩家血药多，打了半天都没啥事，于是在挺帅的过场动画后，就是漫长的血牛互博环节。当然，战斗时长跟以难度著称的魂类游戏是没法比的，但是霍格沃兹之遗本身就不是这类游戏，更何况声名在外的优秀魂类游戏可没有全游戏小怪和boss加起来共享三四个机制的逆天设计。
总的来说，整个战斗机制就是一坨大的，在设计师的努力下，同时做到了毫无创新和体验一般，借鉴都借鉴不太明白，也算是颇具实力了。

[h3] 剧情 [/h3]
及格水平。整个主线给我的感受就是合理或者说意料之中。往好了说，并没有太大的毛病，但与此同时，也几乎没有亮点。整个主线就像一杯白开水，没什么毒点也没什么亮点，平平淡淡没有感觉。

[h3] 细节打磨 [/h3]
可以看出制作组有下功夫构建一个范围相当大的游戏世界，也努力地填充了不少可以探索的内容，但或许是受到产能和时间的压力，很多细节有欠缺打磨。
[b] 服装bug [/b]
我大概第一次进游戏不超过半小时，长袍就在腿上疯狂穿模乱抖了。不过我相信制作组已经努力修复了，或许是技术限制导致有些地方修不好，可以理解。
[b] 所罗门 [/b]
所罗门boss战可以说非常明显的暴露了制作组欠缺细节打磨这一问题。剧情组想要把所罗门塑造成一个极度反感黑魔法的人，而boss设计组却不知为了什么目的（也许是想增加点难度），在所罗门boss战里面加入了大量和他一伙的阴尸。于是最终呈现出来的，就是所罗门一边怒斥玩家和塞巴斯蒂安自甘堕落（其实老子流程里就从来没用过不可饶恕咒），一边伙同满地的阴尸群殴玩家，可谓是狗屁不通。其实修改起来非常简单，如果图省事，可以直接删除boss战里面的阴尸。给所罗门做一个帅帅的过场动画，上来直接一个大招把一地阴尸全秒了，然后开始怒斥玩家和塞巴斯蒂安，随后进行boss战，这样不是更凸显他正派而又固执的角色形象吗？或者也可以保留阴尸，但是对代码做点改进，除了玩家、友军、敌军阵营，让所罗门自己单独处于一个阵营，阴尸就近选择锁定玩家或者所罗门攻击，如果担心改变boss战难度，可以设置让阴尸打所罗门不造成打断和硬直效果，伤害调到几乎没有，或者让所罗门每次被阴尸攻击就直接闪现到远离阴尸的地方躲开攻击，然后设置所罗门AI不锁定阴尸，只打玩家。这样改和现在boss战区别不会特别大，但是看起来就合理很多，现在这个所罗门站在一堆阴尸里面群殴玩家，阴尸对他视而不见，我真不知道设计师自己玩没玩过这一段，反正我是没绷住。

[h3] 总结 [/h3]
正如开篇所说，本作的亮点和不足都相当明确。对于哈利波特的粉丝来说，它可以说是最值得入手游玩的衍生游戏；而对于系列无感或更看重游戏性的玩家来讲，或许本作就算不上顶尖佳作了。 | ---{ Graphics }---

1. No sauce. Game doesn't FEEL good to play
2. Blackjack is fundamentally a push your luck game. Here, going over means you get nothing but being beat by the dealer means you only lose the difference.

Plus this one has a pretty fun plot with recurring characters that you don't see in some other gambling games.

理想
・デッキ構築なんだからデッキ圧縮して21作りまくって勝つンゴね！
・いろんな楽しいテーマデッキで遊ぶンゴね！

現実
・デッキ圧縮の機会が全然ない、結果ゴミが終盤まで大量に残る
・21をコンボで作るより相手邪魔したほうが圧倒的に強い、というかこれで1周目やっとクリアできた
・21を目指す理想的なデッキは10回トライして1回出来るかどうかだけど邪魔するだけならもっと簡単
・テーマデッキ、スタート時の特殊性はクリアしないと開放されない。先にもうちょっと個性的なデッキ使いたかった

それでも良いところ
・1プレイが短いのでヴァンサバ並に周回プレイできる。とにかくプレイ感が軽い
・操作性が良い。ゲーミングUMPCで遊んだけどこれが特に相性が異常に良い
・ストーリーや世界観は素敵
・一部を除いてルールは大体スッキリしてる、日本語訳の優秀さも相まって可読性でストレスを感じることはない | A game I'd love to give a neutral on. The concept is great, but it feels like right as my build engine really got going is when the game ends. Build variety shows promise in design, however I did feel constrained by the medium here. If you're looking for that Balatro itch to be scratched this offers at least a few hours of similar fun, but wasn't overly memorable for me."

Oyunu öncelikle pvp amacıyla oynamak için gelen arkadaşlara tavsiyem direk, uzak durun. oyunda sadece zerg savaşı ve tecavüz var. solo oyuncunun bu oyunda yeri yok.

Oyunda grind bitmiyor malesef, evet biliyorum kore yapımı oyun grind üzerinedir ancak bu oyunda grind'dan pvp'ye yönelemiyorsunuz.

Oyunda optimizasyona gelirsek patatesten hallice, optimizasyon denen birşeyin varlığından haberleri bile yok.

Exploit, bug kısmında allaha emanet takılıyorlar, oyun başından beri hala düzeltilmeyen buglar mevcut ve işin komik kısmı bunları düzeltmek yerine sansürlüyorlar.

Oyunda akıcı bir pvp malesef yok, pvp yapmak istiyorsanız 2 saatte bir gece olmasını bekleyeceksiniz, smalLscale oynayarak pvp'den zevk alıyorsanızda, gittiğiniz yerleri zerglememeleri için dua edeceksiniz.

What I liked:

-PVE is great, it feels rewarding in higher tiers and helps you escalate in lower ones
-Melee combat is fantastic, it feels fluid and has enough fexibility during the first stages

What they must improve:

-Advanced PVP combat is broken, once you get to understand how stats, abilities, and passives work, it turns into a skill-spawn fiesta, or a hack-n-slash-button-smasher brawl combat which favors whoever has the highest stats (mostly vampirism), leaving almost no room for tactics or skill to shine. | I think its a really good game, so is dark and darker. | 垃圾 | Meh | 1"

The blending of spells and puzzles is clever and reminds me of Puzzle Quest, but much less grindy. The main idea is great but as others have already said, it is extremely punishing since healing is scarce throughout the game.

My main issue with this game are the graphics. I love pixel art, but it feels out of place here. The giant pixels feel unnecessary on a PC monitor. This feels like a mobile game port. Maybe the developer should try to make a mobile port to make more money. For Steam, it feels like a waste not to use the great character art displayed on the title screen and character select.

・BGMが良い
・バッジをうまく組み合わせてぶっ壊れ性能の呪文を作って無双したときの爽快感
・戦闘中に中断→再開をすると、戦闘開始時点に戻り敵の行動やボード上の石が全てランダムに再抽選されるため実績解除作業でかなり役に立った

【悪い点】
・キャラ特性のようなものはなく、どのキャラも呪文/バッジは基本共通のものしか出ない。開始時の２つの呪文が違う程度（隠しキャラも劇的に変わるような要素はない）
・ルート選択の自由度は０。１本道な上デメリットなしで自由に行ったり来たりできる
・呪文やバッジのピック機会が少なく運要素がかなり高い

　- 雑魚敵もボスも戦闘報酬は同じでカードピック的な要素も戦闘後には無い
　- ↑によりリスクを覚悟で強敵に挑んでデッキ構築を進める、のような選択肢自体が本ゲームには存在しない
・他ゲーのレリックやポーション的なものは存在しない。呪文とバッジのみ
・デッキ構築の方向性も自由度０
　- 戦闘中にHPを回復する手段がないとクリア不可能。こちらのブロックを無視してダメージを受けるギミックが多すぎる（呪文を唱えるための石自体にダメージデバフが付与されたり、ブロック呪文を詠唱不可にしてきたり。こういった敵の妨害手段を防ぐ術は存在しない）
　- 攻撃面はダメージスケーリングを意識しないとクリア不可能（キャラ問わず、呪いor毒or筋力系の３択）
　- 呪文・バッジの総数が少なく、上記を満たす組み合わせはかなり限定される
・ランダムイベント的なものは存在しない。？アイコンのマスはあるが、第二のショップで固定
・呪文/バッジの強化や削除等の仕様は存在しない。ストックできる呪文は最大６つまでで、溢れる分は既存のものと任意で入れ替える形（そもそも呪文の入手機会自体少ないので入れ替え自体2,3回しか起きない）
・焚き火マスは休憩だが、選択肢自体がHP３０％回復の１つしかない。HP満タンなら意味のないマス | Отличный геймплей. Много билдов разнообразных.

(매일 업데이트되지는 않으며, 작성자가 원할 때마다 업데이트됩니다.)

[1일차]
룰렛을 돌려서 점수를 얻는 게임입니다.
제한된 수량의 토큰이 주어지며 이를 소모해 공을 굴리거나 배팅을 할 수 있죠.
공을 굴리면 룰렛판을 빙글빙글 돌아 랜덤한 포켓에 멈추게 되고 이때 토큰의 점수에 칩, 배수를 계산해 점수를 얻을 수 있습니다.

특정 포켓에 배팅을 진행하여 칩을 증가시킬 수 있습니다.
홀수나 짝수, 검은색이나 붉은색, 특정 숫자 범위 등 다양한 포켓에 배팅이 가능한대, 토큰에 설정가능한 종류가 구분되어있죠.
배팅은 영구적으로 유지가 되며, 공이 멈추면 해당 포켓에 배팅된 항목에 따라 칩이 증가하여 계산이 진행됩니다.
스테이지마다 요구하는 점수를 만족해야하며, 점수를 달성하지 못하면 게임 오버가 되어버리죠.

목표 점수를 달성하면 보상으로 코인을 얻어 상점에서 사용 가능합니다.
다양한 종류의 볼과 토큰 퍽, 포켓, 뱃지 등이 판매되고 리롤을 하거나 잠금을 할 수 있죠.
토큰을 강화하여 점수와 배팅칩을 증가시킬 수도 있고, 만약 코인이 부족하다면 최대 3개까지 코인을 대출받을 수도 있습니다.
남은 코인은 상점을 나가면 그대로 소멸되기에 최대한 알차게 사용하는 것이 좋습니다.

상품으로 판매되는 볼은 다양하게 존재합니다.
특정 범위를 대상으로 목표로 쏘아지는 볼도 있고, 포켓을 복사하는 능력을 가진 볼, 덩치가 커서 여러 포켓을 점하는 볼도 존재하죠.
개인적으로 가장 좋은 볼은 멀티볼로 한 번에 3개의 볼을 쏘아낼 수 있습니다.
점수 배수가 0.5로 계산되어 좀 애매할 수 있지만, 배팅만 잘 된다면 쉽게쉽게 클리어를 할 수 있죠.

토큰 퍽은 해당 토큰에 특별한 능력을 부여합니다.
가장 처음에 또는 가장 마지막에 등장하게 하거나, 한 번 사용하면 파괴되는 능력을 보호하는 것도 존재하죠.
2번 발동하는 종류도 존재하는대, 개인적으로 마지막에 등장하게하는 오메가 퍽과 멀티볼을 활용하면 좋습니다.

포켓은 일반 포켓과 강화 포켓이 존재합니다.
일반 포켓은 기존의 포켓과 교체가 가능하며 이를 통해서 홀수나 짝수 또는 검은색이나 붉은색으로 포켓들을 구성할 수 있죠.
강화 포켓은 배치된 포켓을 유지하면서 특수한 능력을 부여합니다.
해당 포켓에 공이 멈추면 강화를 하거나 골드 획득, 지정된 위치로 텔레포트 등 다양하게 존재하죠.

뱃지의 경우에는 쉽게 유물입니다.
보유한 것으로 다양한 효과가 활성화되며 이를 통해서 점수와 칩, 배수를 증가시킬 수 있고 플레이에 다양한 이점을 가져다 주죠.
일부는 1회성으로 발동하는 경우도 있고, 조건부로 발동하는 경우도 있지만 어쨌든, 많으면 좋다!

외에도 앞서 언급한 토큰의 배팅 대상을 변경하거나 이를 강화하는 항목도 존재합니다.
공을 강화하여 능력을 상승시키는 상품도 존재하죠.

상점에서의 정비가 완료되면 다음 스테이지로 진행합니다.
각 스테이지마다 요구하는 점수가 증가하게 되며, 4번째에는 보스와 마주하게 됩니다.
보스는 플레이어를 방해하는 다양한 능력 중 1가지를 보유하고 있으며, 일부는 플레이어의 조합을 카운터치는 것들도 존재하죠.
여러개의 볼 중 가장 높은 점수만 적용되게하는 멀티볼 견제도 있고, 배팅한 대상 중 일부는 빙결하는 능력도 있고, 배팅하는 칩의 수를 줄이거나 뱃지를 봉인하는 경우도 있고.

첫 보스에게 승리하면 3개의 퀘스트가 주어져 1가지를 선택할 수 있습니다.
퀘스트가 요구하는 조건을 만족하면 특별한 효과를 적용받을 수 있죠.
총 5개의 라운드로 구성되어 있으며, 마지막 보스까지 이겨내면 챌린지 모드로 이어집니다.
챌린지 모드에서는 매 라운드마다 보스가 등장하여 난이도가 올라가고 점수도 급증하여 클리어하기 어려워지죠.

외에도 다트시스템이 존재하여 스테이지 시작 시 랜덤하게 발동합니다.
룰렛판에 다양한 종류의 다트들이 박히는대, 플레이어를 방해하는 다트들도 존재하고 도움을 주는 다트들도 존재하죠.
또한, 최초 클리어를 하면 하우스 엣지 시스템이 언락되어 시작 전에 다양한 칵테일을 제한된 퍼센트 내에서 골라서 다양한 효과를 활성화할 수 있습니다.
시작전에 클래스를 선택하여 플레이 중 조건을 만족해 옵션 효과들을 발동시킬 수도 있죠.

[아쉬운 점]
-좋은 포켓은 다 피해감
-배속 좀 더 빠르게
-뭔가 잭팟이다하는 뭔가 빵하고 터지는 그런 느낌은 크게 없음
-룰렛 위 배팅이 된 곳에 뭔가 반짝인다거나 추가 칩 수량이 노출되거나해서 구분이 되면 좋을듯
-하나의 클리어 조합을 발견하면 그것에 정착하여 다른 조합은 눈이 안 감
-도전과제없음 | Threw my mouse into a wall when i went all in on black and landed on a red number. 10/10

那个时候自己一个人手里孵化三个达人号 因为算是自己在抹门路
就像游戏中要研究如何拍摄才能播放量更高一样
现实中的我当时一直在研究如何写好短视频脚本 分镜的角度 文案的逻辑
经常要上整理很多资料后再去实践试错 一熬熬夜到凌晨一两点
第一次用pr和ps 用的手忙脚乱 到后面计时五分钟就能出一个成品30s的游戏短视频
第一次在抖爸爸哪里直播 第一次开口紧张到磕巴 到后面的幽默风趣 平翘舌精准 知道抖包袱
第一次给自己的视频解说 念稿没有感情像人机 到后面知道给台词加重音 知道哪个地方是情绪高潮点
第一次带货不知道买家痛点 忙了一天就整了几十元利润 到后面千次成本播放计数 一条视频有广就两三百利润
而且当时刚接触起号过程中
很有可能发出去之后根本都没几个人看 要知道抖爸爸的5A很多人可能连前两个A都没达到
当时特别幸苦 剪辑 脚本 拍摄 素材 文案 全都是自己一个人弄

para o jogo ficar melhor, é só adicionando mapas novos, algumas criaturas novas, itens novos e colocar algo mais interessando como algum NPC na ilha de spawn, poderiam aumentar um pouco a porcentagem de aparição de alguns monstros raros, vi duas vezes um montro raro, e as duas vezes foram experiencias fodas.

solo - chato e injogavel
duo -  engraçado com toque de medo e misterio
trio  - melhor tipo de gameplay, engraçado e tu entra na pira de ''criador de conteudo do submundo''

Очень понравилась, абсолютно не напряжная, со своим стилем и историей игра. Однозначно рекомендую! | Decent enough puzzle box game, especially for the price I got it at ($1.19). I think the item duplication and endoscope mechanics helped make it a bit more unique. Not fantastic, but might scratch an itch if you're a fan of the genre. | There is a lot to be said about Machinika: Museum, mostly good and a little bad.  Let me start by saying the I loved the game overall.  I purchased this at a heavy discount, but would have purchased it at the full $7.99 USD price, it would be worth that price tag.  My short review will be broken down into 3 parts.

The Short Review: 4/5 Stars overall good game the puzzles are a bit easy for advanced puzzlers who have played games like the Myst Series, and others in the genre.  Visuals are good, could use more scene variation.  Music fits, but could use some varition.  Price is fitting for game length. 

The Good:  The graphics are very good, lend a sense of realism to the world they are crafted in. They are smooth throughout and I didn't detect or have in glitching or clipping of any kind. The music is fitting to the game and story. The sounds are solid and fit the environment well.  The game play and controls are nice land end themselves to the realism of the environment.  I also liked how when you finished a chapter the puzzle crate slowly built up in the room. The ability to move an object in a full circle was a nice touch.  (I have seen and played other games where you just ""travel"" to the other side of an item instead of manipulating the object to turn it.) 

The Bad: (More like small nit-picks) I dislike Chapter breakdowns. Yeah I get it you are finished with one puzzle and it is time to move to the next puzzle.  I would have liked to have seen another location in the museum. or had a cut scene to show the delivery of another artifact.  The same goes for the music, do not get me wrong the music fits the game, I just wish there was more of it and also for it to change with the game and with certain scenes to add to the tension.  

The Ugly: (Not as bad as you would think)  I needed more game, yes for the price you get about 5-ish hours of game play.  Not bad given the complexity of the puzzles and game play had I not blundered through a few puzzles and remembered the tools I had at my disposable I probably would have completed the game in a trim 4 hrs.  Needed change of scenery and music between puzzles.

In closing the Developers and persons who created this game did an excellent job. I look forward to seeing what Machinika: Atlas has to offer though it appears that the game may be delayed for release, because in the game it seems to be expected by Late 2024. I just bought and finished this game in January of 2025.

I'd give this game a solid 4/5. I've played the free version for a week or two, after which I decided to purchase it on Steam. Even though from the very beginning I knew that one of the maps (Forgotten Castle) lags like there's no tomorrow -- I still opted to buy the game as a show of great appreciation for the game you're cooking there, my dev bros. My machine isn't powerful, but I have absolutely no problem playing in Goblin holes or the Frozen caves -- the castle is the only place I have this issue; and not just the occasional freeze, but constant nagging lagging, which results in me having played on that map only thrice throughout these 30 hours, or the 40 more that I've played on the EpicGames version. 

Otherwise -- most brilliant of games, and most brilliant of concepts. There's nothing quite like this experience, especially after you learn that none of the gear, even hidden deep in your hard-bought stashes is there forever. The game does a rollover every so often, and everybody has to start with absolutely nothing, and once you learn that -- something sparks in you. There is something absolutely visceral in the realization that the potions that you hoard for 'a later more important dungeon' may just one day disappear without ever having been used. Then you begin playing the game with actually having fun! An absolutely lovely touch! 

If you like hard games that reward learning the complex (but comfortably so) mechanics, but also enjoy the goofiness of jolly cooperation, and the occasional toxic backstabbing -- this would be your cup of coffee. For tea will not sustain you during the long nights you might spend playing this gem. Just please, for the love of all that is cute in this world -- optimize the third map. 

And please, don't abandon this game, it has some rare potential | It is a cool concept but it needs a lot of work. It also needs so lighting changes. The game is way to dark. I know the irony of it. | игра ебаный кусок калла, разработчики долбаебы, 3к деревянных просят за сырую баганую, вечно стакающкю тебя игру, ты парируешь атаку? а хуй тебе атака сквозь меч, тебя хуй пойми как убили, просотр смерти, но толку если сервера гавно пинг в России гавно и ты на демо видишь как противник не попадает в тебя, мало того расстояние до тебя иногда колоссальное чуть ли не 180 градусов тычковой атакой, адаптируйся,  ты стараешься заучить босса, а хуй тебе отмена анимации и ты ловишь в ебало, стоишь на месте, держишь пери на 1м месте, тебя бьет крип едиственной атакой шанс парировать примерно 70/30 а почему? а потому что игра кусок дерьма, сервера картошки, скорее все эти проблемы из за пинга, меня заебал пинг в кс, но здесь это возведено в абсолют, можно сколько угодно оправдывать игру ""в раннем доступе"" но за 3к она не должна быть настолько обрыганской, задумка классная, механика (если исключить стаки в 1м паучке, телепортацией мобов и кучу других багов) тоже, реализация в дерьме, разработчик долбаеб и вместо популярных багфиксов выкатывает свой хуй,  1 словом игра сырая, баганная, но я продолжу играть и жрать это гавно, всем спасибо, отцам разраба дизлайк | Pve Bosses Are Way Too Hard. think there should be a way to play the game solo to learn pve fairly without wasting all your time"

The only downside was that the ending felt rather lackluster, building up this idea of something big only to be rather anticlimactic. Those last prestige levels 20-25+ were samey and I couldn't die and everything was killed by me just standing still basically. If you could get slightly more input/choice in the end it would be much better! Loved it anyway. | At first it seems rather simple but as you progress it opens up and becomes a lot of fun and very addicting.

Brilliantly made. | Good little game. Not too hard, starts a little slow but gives you plenty of early game choices but ends with a full web and grind | Great game. Wish it was a bit longer but a very fun game to kill some time. But i wish it was more replayability.
But still great!!! | Great game. It's got a skill tree that gives you control over your playing experience. Starts off a little hands on, but after a few hours to progresses to a mostly hands-off idler if you invest in filling out the entire skill tree, which isn't technically necessary. The skills are practical and I found myself looking forward to unlocking new ones as the tree opened up. It's not a matter of if you'll get 100% achievements, it's just a matter of time. I'm a completionist; unlocking the entire skill tree before rounding out 100% achievements took less than 15 hours. If you were trying to complete it quickly, you might be able to do it with the game running for fewer than 10 hours.

Oh yeah, it's got sweet low-fi synth music to enjoy.  Music I actually like listening to outside of the game."

-This game has an OK community
-The issue is the Devs, trying to dump hundreds of outfits to whales to sale to a very inflated market
-The Devs have also backstabbed several times the community
-Making a Gunslinger after stating they would NOT make a gun class(Nice)
-If you want to play this game, DO NOT SPEND MONEY.
-The community is mostly dying as less and less people fight world bosses on NA, it use to be an all server wide thing but now only a hand full. | Antes de conocer tu juego, tenia novia, era feliz, tenia familia y diversion, ahora solo tengo diversion, gracias por tu juego. | Karakter tasarım kısmından sonra oyunu sildim çok oynamadım ama karakter tasarlamak çok eğlenceli. | DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME.

Developers are completely out of touch, servers as unstable as the Somalian economy. They make promises they never keep or if they keep them its years after they said they would do it. Really wish I could recommend it but I can't. | As fun as the gameplay is, that's like literally the only compliment i can give it outside of the game looking beautiful, it's a sadistic grindfest that is so unbelievably overwhelming for any player, i have 200 hours and i still have zero clue what im doing because i am being constantly bombarded with new items and systems that by the time i get a grasp on one thing, i have to learn 5 more new things."
