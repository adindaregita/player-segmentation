The level isint really that interesting, most interesting thing is how you have to use the drift feature a bit more, if you can call it that its moreso an extended sidestep. the story it promises in relation to future DLC is quite interesting to me, with the mention of coming back later. Keanu's voice acting isint really there for me, the basic noises are fine but the actual dialogue just sounds like a bad narration job. The model job on the movie shadow is where I really think the price point gets to me, in all honesty I cant really put my finger on what I dont like about it, something about it just really gives me the ick.

76561198025545215,1.0,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Action,Recommended,"I'll be reviewing the individual game, as well as each DLC here, there will be spoilers since I cant recommend this game if you know nothing. REBIRTH- I have played this version the least, but I know whats in it, and how you unlock it. For one the game is really fun off the bat, and most of the items have real uses, but heres the cool thing about this, and binding of isaac as a whole, synergies. If you grab one thing and then grab another, theres a chance it will synergize with it, creating something craaaazy. Like a exploding laser of doom. But in this version theres really only synergies with like 15 items. Which I guess makes sense, can you imagine having to code at least 600 synergies that some may never see? This is a pretty tight base game that can stand on its own 2 feet. AFTERBIRTH- this one I have no emotions on, it barely adds anything and the items it adds are pretty useless. The main thing this one adds is a new area with a new boss fight, as well as a new gamemode, but thats it. AFTERBIRTH+- This one is probably closest to being my least favorite, it adds MORE new items that suck, and it adds in a unfun area with reused assets, and a final boss so frustrating and unfun that it honestly makes me sick. ON TOP OF adding ANOTHER new game mode which is just a harder mode of the one we already SAW. It only has mod support going for it. REPENTANCE- This one brings it up by about 10,000 and adds a lot of new things. New areas that arent lazy and unoriginal? Yep, new bosses that are actually fun and fair (most of the time)? Yep, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ new synergies for the new items on top of reworked items that sucked mega dong in the other versions? Yep, game actually being hard? Yep. yep, and yep. It even adds a lot of new characters, but you have to unlock them in a odd way, but its very worth it. While the final boss of afterbirth+ still makes me ask why I have to this every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time the new stuff added makes it all so much better. The big thing however are synergies, they have so many more synergies in this game then any other game. If you have 50 bucks to spare, just skip the others and get this one, and if you have been playing afterbirth+ for a while now and are getting sick of it, get this, it makes you feel like you're playing isaac for the first time again since 2011 or 2013 or whenever the hell you started playing.",461.9 hrs on record																					(185.9 hrs at review time),N/A,
76561198025545215,1.0,Katana ZERO,"Action, Indie",Recommended,"I just, dont know what to say. Its so good, its so addicting, but there is a couple issues that prevent me from saying this is the greatest game of our millennium and you should rob a bank to play it if you must. But first, the good. Holy ♥♥♥♥. Where do I begin? Everything about this is amazing, the visuals, the views, the time slowing stuff (which has a in game explanation, but thats MASSIVE spoiler territory.), the sounds, the story, its all just amazing. Theres even different game types and even characters! I actually wanna give an example of how the story very greatly ties in with the gameplay for a brief second. So In one level, you find a tape of a place you were at earlier in the game, in that location everyone was dead including the person you're trying to kill. And earlier after a very intense motorbike chase the guy you are about to kill is suddenly whisked away by someone with blonde hair, weird right? You don't know much, only that he calls himself ""the dragon"" which has been your nickname in news articles. So once you find the tape and watch it, you find out ""The dragon"" was the one who killed everyone earlier. And even cooler? YOU GET TO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ PLAY AS HIM. And he even has a special ability you NEVER get to have in the game, not even after watching the tape. And its such a power trip Im surprised I didint die from being hard. Its such an ingenious way to tell the player just how powerful this guy really is, and how you cant even begin to live up to those standards. and another thing I wanna gush about, the bosses are just really good, if this were a cuphead style game where you kill mostly bosses I would love this game about as much as I do now. Theres only 3 (4 if you count the one im not sure is beatable) bosses, and all of them are fantastic, and the buildup to said bosses and payoff is so great every time. now for the stuff I didint think was as great. 1. Sometimes the controls respond a bit later then you expect, now I dont know if its always like this since I only noticed in the last levels, but sometimes when I push the dodge button, you'd expect the DODGE button to activate immediately right? No, it just doesent sometimes. 2. The game has the worlds most abrupt ending in the history of abrupt endings. You just kill a bunch of people, game ends. Thats it. And its kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cause theres alot of loose ends that are just not explained. But it is safe to assume that most will be explained in the upcoming DLC, one which I still wonder if we actually have a name for yet. 3. Theres not enough bosses, 3 is simply too little for me, especially with how masterfully made they are. 4. The game in general is really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ short. See those 4 hours at time of review? Thats how long the game is, and most of my time was spent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around and dying. And speaking of 5. The game is just a bit too easy, I havent played the hardmode yet, so I may eat my words, but most of my deaths were cause I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around and dying because of it, of course I dont know how to make the game harder without making it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, other than more bosses and tougher enemies maybe. I just wish it were slightly harder. and thats about it, most of the stuff I complained about is subjective, except maybe #1. but that could just have been me not releasing till that point. So objectively this game is perfect. Buy it, just do it. Im not giving you a choice, if you arent convinced yet how are you even human?",9.8 hrs on record																					(5.2 hrs at review time),N/A,

Theres little to no note customization such as moving the playfield, making the notes larger, etc. If you want those you need to mess around in the noteskin itself. Everything this game does feels like its done better in other VSRG's such as etterna's packs, osu!mania's holds, etternas customization, and etternas holds.

76561198025545215,1.0,Max Payne 3,Action,Recommended,"Pros: Gameplay is really great, thats it. Its just really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good. More gameplay styles, and by that I mean 1 that I remember and its the most boring one (on rail shooting) Difficulty is really high, I played on easy mode and still died alot of times. I can only imagine what ungodly horror old school cool is. Cons: The game is really forgettable, I dont even remember why the villain wanted what he wanted. Gameplay feels really repeated, Espescially since headshots are instant kills now so I played the game as jump, shoot heads with perfect pricision cause mouse and keyboard, repeat till on rail shooting segment. The graphic novel style is completley abandoned, the only one that even slightly calls back to it is parts in cutscenes where theres a letterbox then one part freezes, best I could compare it to is a animated comic book, if that makes sense. And this also makes cutscenes unremarkable. In the first max payne I always remembered what max had to say in each cutscene because of the style in which it was delivered. The constant VFX in cutscenes are really sickening. Best thing I can compare it to is if the gorillaz tranz video was a cutscene. It just feels like an attempt to make it seem memorable (even though they could've done that if they'd just kept the graphic novel style but ok) I dont care if its cause we're in maxes head, the graphic novel style was the same thing, but that was different from other games, and not just Mocap cutscenes. Max never shuts the ♥♥♥♥ up, and almost has nothing to add. In the first game max would always have something to say, but only in cutscenes, and his writing was fantastic. In this game Max never shuts up, and he only says ♥♥♥♥ that infants could figure out in the womb. Like a ammo box later in the game, max goes ""Oh look a box, I would say its a coincidence that this factions ammo crate was in this factions area was a coincidence but I write ♥♥♥♥ off too often"" like what does that add? It just feels like the writing team wanted to flex their muscles but passed out and fell into a fire pit, so they hired last minute replacements. Game feels generic with the setting, a old veteran of ♥♥♥♥ going to a different country but it doesent turn out well? If you just change a few things in that summary you get Far cry 3, compared to the first game with the new york setting, noire style, and graphic novel cutscenes, compared to the third games random country that isint USA setting, action hero style, and generic mocap/CGI cutscenes. Do i recommend it?: yes. The gameplay is simply too good to pass up, but just know the story is ass.",11.8 hrs on record																					(8.6 hrs at review time),N/A,
76561198025545215,1.0,N/A,N/A,Recommended,"Pros: really great atomsphere, it just pulls you in so well. There are little to no cutscenes, the story beats are told in graphic novel style which is so unbearably cool. The graphics (ignoring the unintentional comedy of the faces) are really good for 2001 non AAA studio. The voice acting and writing is good, like really good. Like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. alot of weapons to choose from, even if some are clearly better than others. Cons: Some parts are a bit trial and error. With the most notable one being the final level where it broke my F9 key Theres no checkpoints, so you have to quicksave and quickload every 5 seconds, but the issue is that this can easily be manipulated to make the game a literal cakewalk. And also you can get stuck in deathloops, but the game has a failsafe for that where the enemy just misses. But that can sometimes mess up, but usually its cause theres an alternative way to gtfo. Do I recommend this?: ♥♥♥♥ yes, I tend to dislike older games that were ""revolutionary"" back then (I dont like timesplitters 2, fight me.), but this game has stood the test of time and hopefully will continue to do so. SPOILERS AHEAD STOP READING IF YOU PLAN TO BUY THIS GAME Game leaves a bit to be desired for the ending, as of writing this I dont know if this is explained in the 2nd game cause I havent finished it yet. But theres no explanation for Why alfred survives What the main villian wanted Who exactly the inner circle were and what they wanted Why theres scientists in a abandoned facility apparently still doing research How maxes wife finds out about Valkyr How people who would've had missing posters up just somehow were at Maxes place and only arrived there like 0.2 seconds before max did which literally implies max making a joke at the beginning literally condemns his wife and kid to death. and a bit more.",10.7 hrs on record,N/A,

I like this game's story, environments, and premise however I wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends cuz of bugs bunny: Hitboxes are messed up... Some vents I have to fiddle around with for 20 secs because the hitbox to get in is so small, leaving my but whole wide open for the alien to come. Sound triggers are extremely poor in some areas. I was minding my own business in a corridor, alien nowhere near me and for no reason the music just strikes up and deafens me - when nothing is happening. Also when I equip the flamethrower and look around, it sounds like two horses event triggers are also buggy, once had to wiggle against a door just to get an objective to update A really good one is when a hostile human shot at me, so I burned his bottom to a crisp with a molotov. I feel accomplished and then the screen turns black and says ""gg idiot, don't kill innocent civilians..."" yh cuz an innocent civilian would shoot me. That one set me back about 10 minutes of progress lol :DD about 20% of the time, the game waits an extra 0.2 secs before it detects my mouse movement a few doors also blend in with walls, making it hard to see them. navigation is a bit backwards in this game. Backtracking is fine but when your map has poor boundaries it gets annoying having to guess the way back rolf a few humans you meet along the way are there for, well, no reason at all. Saw some woman sitting on a bench out in the open - her only interaction was a bland voice line about how she was going to die or something. Ok cool, thanks for the lack of basic human integrity... Missed opportunity to have the character ask her something common sense like ""why aren't you hiding for safety?"" Takes some of the humanity out of the game and makes the humans seem like the same as the androids - mindless machines. Interactions with fellow humans in this game are a bit cringy; it ignores the basic psychology of humans and sometimes the ai will just 360 and shoot you even though you're crouched making no sounds game is worth it though if you get it for like 2 riyals in a sale",16.4 hrs on record																					(16.2 hrs at review time),N/A,

76561198350155133,1.0,Hello Neighbor,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy",Recommended,"Disappointing but still fun somehow. Most of the puzzles don't make any logical sense like the shotgun puzzle for instance, the only way I could solve it was by using the lever, glitching my shotgun through the wall and then respawning to get the red key. Not even YouTube could save me on that one. The game play is really janky and rage inducing most of the time but I just like the art style and the creepy neighbor, that's the only real redeeming quality for me. I genuinely think you're better off playing the Alphas and maybe playing Hello Neighbor 2 instead, I much preferred that over this.

The game could be scarier but it really isn't when there are so many ways to avoid the enemies, both the jump scares and the score are underwhelming (it's literally one track for each enemy and it loops infinitely until they have lost you or killed you), all of this combined doesn't give you a scary game it just gives you a game where you avoid someone. The graphics are fine, I think it feeds into the aesthetic but I would've liked some lore to the game instead of just different cut scenes for each different escape also some explanation for why the Granny does what she does, the same can be said for the side characters like the Spider Granny and Slendrina.

Story and characters keep you engaged and the humour in this game is a nice addition, it doesn't entirely take it self serious which is a good thing but it also has that perfect balance where it's not entirely goofy. 𝗖𝗢𝗡𝗦 I'm not going to lie to you but this game could've had some improvements, regarding survivor AI and combat. Now survivor AI is a really big pain in the A**, you essentially need to keep calling them over in order for them to follow you and most of the time they're completely incapable of protecting themselves meaning it isn't really a rare occurrence for them to die. Combat is really bad for today's standards. You cannot block incoming attacks, leaving you completely vulnerable and in order to shoot your gun you have to aim down sights, making you stand still. You can free fire without having to do that but then accuracy is almost abysmal. 𝗧𝗜𝗣𝗦 Just a few tips for new players like me: • Immediately after leaving the security room and upon entering the Warehouse you can find mannequins, throw them and pick up their torso, it one hits zombies • You can refill camera batteries at Cam's Camera located in the Paradise Plaza • For quick traversal you can go to SporTrance for a Skate board located in the Paradise Plaza • Before 3PM on day 1 you can get rifles and shotguns at the Huntin' Shack in the North Plaza • You can find books throughout the entire mall that give you certain buffs to your stats 𝗖𝗢𝗡𝗖𝗟𝗨𝗦𝗜𝗢𝗡 This game is probably one of the best zombie games out there, now my favourite one.

Would of liked to see more mechanics added.

More of a variety of locations other than houses, maybe banks, jewellery stores, supermarkets, etc. Also the new drone, phone and buddy feel like gimmicks to me but I guess we'll see more on full release.

You can argue there's transport now but the map is not built with it in mind, it feels like a mistake and it just doesn't work. The building is my next gripe. It's more immersive but way more creatively limiting. There's just things that could build in the first game that wouldn't be possible now plus the fact it takes way longer to build, which can be fatiguing. I'd give the game a 7/10.

76561198350155133,4.0,Chernobylite Complete Edition,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation",Recommended,"After 100% completing this game this is what I have to say. Chernobylite is a really story rich linear sandbox survival game that has you in the shoes of a scientist named Igor searching for your wife Tanya in a post apocalyptic Chernobyl. While playing the game you look for clues surrounding your long lost wife that you see in visions. These clues allow you to run simulations of past events. It's a cool idea but simply just dialogue, (I wish it would've been interactive). You scavenge for supplies for your base, companions and weapon upgrades. Every decision made will affect your companions, game play and ending of the game. You can alter your decisions later on by visiting the memory timeline if you so happen to mess up, which is a really nice feature. The NAR are your main enemy throughout the game, which also happen to be the cause of this apocalypse. In addition of this apocalypse are the shadows which can be found out in the wild. The shadows don't really pose much of a threat and are easy enough to handle. This game offers stealth to take down enemies but it isn't really the best, I've been sandwiched by two guards while hidden in a bush multiple times, crouching and hiding in the bushes is the extent of the stealth system in this game unfortunately. Levelling up is easy enough. You level up by completing quests, killing enemies, upgrading weapons, upgrading your base and gathering materials. While roaming around there's almost always side quests which is also another way of levelling up your character. Each level gives you a skill point and each companion has their own skill tree. These companions can be sent on scavenge quests. Companions all have their unique traits and are only useful to you if equipped with the right gear. Something to mention which I find quite cool is the worry of underfeeding you and your companions which will lower morale. Also some of the base upgrades will affect your companions quality of life. The difficulty settings don't really do much apart from increase the amount of enemies and their health, there also isn't really any reward for playing a higher difficulty either which can be seen as a good or bad thing. Weapons in this game aren't really that interesting to use apart from the energy weapons which you unlock later on. There are quite a lot of bugs in this game as well as a lack of polish in some places but not enough to ruin the experience as a whole. I had a blast playing this game and it basically replaced my life for a few days so I highly recommend this game.

You have the option to have hunger and thirst on and off, I play without because it is way too easy to find food resources so there isn't any point having it on, the developers should work on that.

This game needs a fast travel system, the map is far too large to drive around also another thing that needs some work is swimming, you can't swim, it damages you when you touch water. Other than those few minor issues I've experienced this game is really enjoyable. Loot abandoned buildings covered in zombies and try your best to survive. At night there is what the game calls ""hordes"" which spawns in zombies to attack you, every night increases the difficulty but you are rewarded with a 10% health boost every night you survive! I recommend  this game to anyone who just wants a linear survival game where you just kill zombies. (Edit: I have come to falling in love with this game. This is the best zombie survival I've played other than 7 Days To Die and I don't understand the bad reputation of this game, it's a janky alpha build that's still in development, but people are so hard on it? This game is really easy to learn with a very small learning curb and it's very easy to pick up. The developers have left out small things like, not telling you how to repair weapons. I had to go searching through steam guides to figure it out. But this game is close to perfect, it just needs some bug fixes and a multiplayer revival. If you're sceptical of buying this game because it's an early access title I would wait until the full version of the game releases).",27.8 hrs on record																					(3.2 hrs at review time),N/A,
76561198350155133,6.0,Subsistence,"Action, Early Access",Recommended,"I've been playing this game a little. And if you're considering picking it up take this into consideration. To list all the negatives of this game; Low spawn rates for the majority of items making it difficult to craft anything, difficult to kill enemies and janky combat. This game needs a lot of work. Main reason being, you have to spend hours on end just to initially build a base, hours and hours crafting equipment for your character. Yeah I understand that this game was intended to be difficult but even on lower difficulty settings it's still such a grind, which for me just makes it a whole lot boring, just doing the exact same thing over and over again. Not to mention this game tries to be realistic but it fails, some of the crafting recipes don't even make sense and are just unnecessarily hard just for the sake of being hard, with little reward too. This game is fun don't get me wrong but I just wish you could muck around a bit more. If you still want to pick it up, go ahead it's a good game but if you don't want to go through all the pain maybe just wait some more for a full release but on sale it's a fair price.",30.9 hrs on record																					(20.2 hrs at review time),N/A,

Add Jason Vorhees). As the Killer you have to make sure to stop the Survivors, surviving! Survivors are fun too! You go around repairing 5 generators to unlock a gate to escape from the Killers.

76561198350155133,8.0,Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2,Action,Recommended,"This game is far better than its predecessor. More weapons, more missions, more objectives and more customisation.  The skill tree is okay, the stealth and combat skills make you human terminator and the gadget skills seem useless, to me anyway because I don't use the drone or turret. The weapons are good apart from the un-suppressed ones I can't see myself using because stealth seems like the most enjoyable way to play the game since the enemies delete your hp. The maps are good, but my only critizism is the majority of maps are set in the desert which is disappointing but this game's predecessor had the same issue with the majority of maps in the snow. The game play is AMAZING apart from I get a bug that happens frequently where the enemies don't die from head shots and this also happens with cameras, the only fix is to empty a whole clip into them or either reload your save which is very inconvenient. The graphics are great and this game runs great unlike it's predecessor, in the last game I averaged 30 - 45 fps in lowest settings on a F*CKING RX 5700 XT, LIKE WTF??!?!?! But this game runs at a solid 90 - 144 fps in high settings. My conclusion to this buggy masterpiece is.. Buy it if you like snipers, stealth and Hitman type missions otherwise don't get this game.

76561198350155133,10.0,Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts,Action,Recommended,"This game is fun but there are many flaws. To put it straight there was a couple of bugs I kept experiencing, the npcs would sometimes teleport behind cover and kill me also npcs would get stuck on walls quite often. The AI is just laughably dumb. There are these turrets that are ridiculously OP that can kill you within 1-2 seconds. Every time you finish an objective you have to walk to an extraction point, which gets quite annoying. There is no transport other than walking, which is weird since Sniper Ghost Warrior 3 had transport. Most of the guns are quite boring, every AR and pistol feels the same apart from varying stats also there's quite little weapons to choose from. The good things about this game is really fun sniping which is very satisfying to pull off a head shot from 200m away, the skill points are really f***king OP but are very fun to use. The missions feel like Hitman which I really like and the graphics are really nice.

76561198350155133,11.0,Outlast,"Action, Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"Outlast is great. The atmosphere is really compelling and the story is simplistic but the real horror is that what takes place in Outlast could actually happen which is what makes it scary. In fact it's based off of real life events. To add to this it has a really good score which really adds a lot of value to the game, it implies what the main character is feeling and without it, it would really take away from the horror. In terms of game play, people may not like it but I think the fact you're completely incapable of defending yourself from the variants and your only option is to run and hide, it really makes you feel vulnerable. Without the feeling this game wouldn't work anywhere near as well, in fact I'd go as far as saying it wouldn't of been the success it is without it. For anyone playing for the first time, I seriously recommend playing on the Nightmare difficulty, I think it's the definitive way of playing this game. Normal difficulty takes a lot away from the horror since it's quite hard to die, where as Nightmare makes enemies have an improved sense of hearing, they inflict more damage and run faster. This makes it an actual challenge to escape each encounter and I wish I would've played on Nightmare difficulty on my first play through. Also I'd recommend the DLC and replaying a few times at least. I noticed so many new things that I didn't initially pick up the first couple of times. If you haven't already played Outlast and you love everything horror I strongly recommend it, I don't think you'll regret it.

I think it's so cool that you can make a pistol into a full auto SMG and turning a AR into a grenade launcher. Also the game has quite alot of tasks to do so this game will probably take me a while to fully complete.

The entire game is essentially stealing from houses, pawning off items or selling them online, dismantling cars, jewellery and hacking devices. The money you collect you spend on more equipment to make stealing items easier. This is essentially the entire game but the story along with the contracts are what makes it fun. I think that it's a shame that the developers didn't make many contracts though. Most of the game is levelling up to meet the level or skill requirement to complete a contract and I think the lack of voice acting is also a missed opportunity, I really liked the character ""Vinny"" but he's just a voice on a phone, more characters to meet would've been nice. More mechanics would've also been nice as well as there is no way to counter being caught, tenants some how notice that a door has been opened when walking through it, if you are seen by a guard or the police you are instantly killed and there aren't any repercussions as you can just load last checkpoint and continue, etc. I hope we see some new additions as well as some improvements when the sequel comes out.

76561198350155133,12.0,The Forest,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Simulation",Recommended,"I've been playing since the full release of this game and it is still miles ahead of it's sequel. Building is good, melee combat is meh but the replay ability is really good. I've already played multiple new games and still continue to do so. Enemy cannibals and mutants are creepy and the story is good enough to keep you interested. There's so much fun to be had and it is still probably what I'd consider to be the best survival game on the market.",111.1 hrs on record																					(87.4 hrs at review time),N/A,

(Edit: I hate how every enemy on the map is alerted if you're caught and I don't like how it's one shot one kill also there's literally only one weapon in the whole game which gets kinda old after a while but apart from that the game is really good).,22.8 hrs on record																					(10.4 hrs at review time),N/A,

The story is pretty good and the game play is great, all the guns sound great and head shots in this game are very satisfying.",8.7 hrs on record																					(8.1 hrs at review time),N/A,

Stealth and loud is fun every gun is unique and satisfying to use also every heist is fun and well made but.. The only bad thing I can possibly say is the hostage AI, they just walk around and stand up in the open and fail me in most of the stealth heists. Apart from that this game is great and I couldn't recommend it anymore.",494.4 hrs on record																					(370.5 hrs at review time),N/A,
