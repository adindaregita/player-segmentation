76561197970698176,220,Half-Life 2,0.1666666666666666,Action,0,"A monumental game in my gaming career, Half-Life 2 was that defining experience that made me realise I was in for something next level. For the first time i picked it up on The Orange Box in 2008, and from the moment I booted it up, I knew I was in for a wild ride. It wasn’t just a game—it was an event. The environments were absolutely massive, the atmosphere was unreal, and the soundtrack? Edgy as hell. Every moment felt like a cinematic journey.

In Half-Life 2, you play as Gordon Freeman, arguably one of the most reluctant action heroes in gaming. You awaken from stasis, burdened with the trauma of the previous game, and are immediately thrust into action as the figurehead of an uprising. This isn’t a simple revolution—it’s a battle against a multiversal alien threat, shrouded in dystopian themes and orchestrated by secretive organizations manipulating events behind the scenes.

Set in a world dominated by the Combine, an alien regime that combines interdimensional authoritarianism with advanced technology, you must navigate a planet under their control. Armed with little more than a crowbar and your signature nonverbalism, Gordon becomes the key figure in the resistance. As you progress, you'll engage in intense combat, solve puzzles, explore diverse environments, and uncover the unsettling truth that nothing in this world is as it seems.

And let’s talk about The G-Man—a mysterious, interdimensional CIA glowman who pops up like a bad dream and probably controls the entire charade like a cosmic puppeteer. Is he good? Is he bad? Is he just playing the long game? Who knows, but he’s definitely got his hand in everything, watching Gordon like a hawk, pulling strings like an invisible god. 

You’d think it’s just a sci-fi conspiracy, but after a while, you start questioning if anyone really knows what the hell is going on. Does G-Man even have a purpose, or is he just a cosmic observer who gets his kicks out of watching a man with a crowbar take on the end of the world?

The game’s narrative feels like a giant puzzle, and each step forward opens up even more questions, all while you’re tearing through enemy lines, trying to get answers. And the best part? It’s not all about combat—there are puzzles to solve, mysteries to uncover, and a sense of isolation that keeps you on edge, constantly wondering who or what will show up next. The pacing is incredible, making you feel like you’re a tiny piece of something far larger, with consequences that span across dimensions.

Now when the episodes are combines (haha) The user experience is smooth and now it is even moddable! 5/5 | 之前20周年更新开发者评论模式后我又打了一遍，阀是怎样做到的，让我反复爱上它们的游戏。在游戏里跟开发者评论一起探索是我最喜欢的事，我喜欢看游戏开发历程和小故事，实在是让人大开眼界。
为什么这个滑梯不能上去，这个跷跷板是可以玩的，原来这里也有小巧思，这里的电线是视觉引导物，怎样保持一个休闲和紧张的平衡，能在游戏里亲自上手跟看GDC或者工具箱是完全不一样的体验，我会贪婪地希望每一个我喜欢的游戏都添加开发者评论。 | ""Half-Life 2"" is one of the most influential and groundbreaking first-person shooters ever made. Released in 2004 by Valve, it redefined what players could expect from a video game in terms of both storytelling and gameplay. The game’s narrative is immersive, unfolding without traditional cutscenes, which allows the player to feel like they are truly part of the story. The protagonist, Gordon Freeman, is a silent hero who navigates through a dystopian world filled with alien invaders and oppressive human forces. This unique approach to storytelling pulls the player into the game’s world, making every action feel meaningful.

The physics engine in ""Half-Life 2"" was revolutionary for its time. The way objects interact with the environment feels natural and intuitive, and it became a major part of the gameplay. From solving puzzles using physics to creatively using the environment as a weapon, it was an innovation that influenced many games that followed. The gravity gun, which allows players to manipulate objects in real-time, is still one of the most memorable and fun weapons in gaming history.

The level design in ""Half-Life 2"" is another standout feature. The game introduces players to varied environments, from the dark, industrial city of City 17 to the eerie, remote marshlands. Each location feels carefully crafted, with attention to detail that makes the world feel alive. The pacing is also masterful, alternating between moments of intense combat and slower, atmospheric sequences that allow the player to soak in the environment and story.

The AI in ""Half-Life 2"" was also ahead of its time. Enemies behave intelligently, using cover, working together, and reacting to the player’s actions in a way that makes combat more dynamic and challenging. The enemy variety, from the terrifying Combine soldiers to the creepy headcrabs, keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging. The interactions with NPCs and the world around you help build a sense of tension and immersion, keeping you on edge throughout the experience.

The game's soundtrack, composed by Kelly Bailey, perfectly complements the atmosphere, using subtle but effective music to enhance both the action and the quieter moments. The sound design is top-notch, with ambient sounds adding to the immersion, whether you're in a busy city street or exploring a deserted warehouse.

Ultimately, ""Half-Life 2"" is a masterpiece that still holds up to this day. Its innovative gameplay, storytelling, and technical achievements make it a game that set a new standard for the industry. It’s a game that’s not just fun to play, but one that’s easy to appreciate for the way it shaped the future of video games. Even though it’s been years since its release, ""Half-Life 2"" remains a classic that continues to inspire both players and developers alike.

Counter-Strike: Source (CS: Source) is the definitive version of one of the most iconic tactical shooters ever created. Built on the Source engine, it brought stunning graphics, refined mechanics, and an immersive experience that kept players engaged for years. It improved upon its predecessor, Counter-Strike 1.6, and laid the foundation for future games in the series, including Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Here's why CS: Source remains a perfect 10/10 for fans of competitive gaming.

Why It’s a Must-Play
🔫 Precise Gunplay
At the core of CS: Source is its tight and rewarding gun mechanics. Every weapon in the game feels unique, with its own recoil patterns and handling characteristics. This precision-driven combat is one of the key factors that makes CS: Source such a compelling competitive experience. From the M4A4's controlled spray to the AWP's one-shot kills, every engagement requires skill and accuracy.

🌍 Map Design & Tactical Depth
The iconic maps like Dust 2, Inferno, and Nuke are where the game shines brightest. Each map is meticulously designed to offer a balance of tactical positions, choke points, and strategic opportunities. Whether you're defending bomb sites or pushing through tight corridors, the map design fosters deep teamwork and careful planning.

💥 Gameplay Mechanics
CS: Source features smooth, fluid movement, making it easy to peek around corners, hold angles, and strafe while shooting. The buy system gives players the freedom to choose their preferred weapons and gear, while round-based gameplay forces teams to be efficient with their resources and execute well-planned strategies.

🎮 Vibrant Community & Modding Support
The modding community for CS: Source has been incredibly active, creating a wealth of custom content from maps to skins to even entirely new game modes. This extends the life of the game by offering nearly endless ways to enjoy the experience. The server browser lets players dive into unique community-run servers, making every session feel fresh and exciting.

🎨 Improved Visuals
Powered by the Source engine, CS: Source delivered a massive graphical leap from its predecessors, offering realistic lighting, better textures, and advanced physics. These improvements gave the game a more immersive and polished feel, while the physics engine introduced interactive objects and destructible environments, adding a layer of depth to gameplay.

What Makes It a 10/10
CS: Source isn’t just a game; it’s a tactical masterpiece that’s stood the test of time. Its emphasis on team coordination, strategy, and individual skill is unmatched. Whether playing with friends or random players, the experience fosters a strong sense of community and competition, making each match feel meaningful. The team-based objectives – like bomb planting/defusal – combined with tight, tactical combat is a dynamic experience that few shooters can replicate.

The longevity of CS: Source is a testament to how well it was designed. While newer titles in the series (like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive) have taken inspiration from it, the smoothness of the gameplay, iconic maps, and endless customization options keep it relevant in the competitive FPS scene.

If you’re a fan of shooters and haven’t experienced CS: Source, you’re missing out on one of the most influential and well-rounded tactical shooters ever made. It’s a game that offers both depth and accessibility, making it suitable for casual players, yet still offering enough challenge for the competitive elite. CS: Source is a timeless classic—pure, competitive, and still as enjoyable today as it was when it first released.",CS: Source is a must-play for any gamer.

Half-Life: Deathmatch: Source is a multiplayer first-person shooter developed by Valve. It is a remake of the classic Half-Life deathmatch mode, utilizing the Source engine. The game combines the fast-paced action of traditional deathmatch with updated graphics and more fluid movement mechanics. While it successfully brings new life to the original concept, some mechanical issues and a niche player base prevent it from being as popular as its predecessors.

What Works Well?
🎮 Classic Deathmatch Gameplay
The core of Half-Life: Deathmatch is its tight, fast-paced combat. It stays true to the original deathmatch mode, offering classic weapons, high-speed action, and simple, enjoyable mechanics. The formula remains as fun today as it was when first introduced.

🌆 Updated Graphics with Source Engine
The move to the Source engine has significantly improved the visuals compared to the original. The lighting, textures, and models are much sharper, breathing new life into the iconic Half-Life universe. The environments feel more immersive, and physics interactions are more dynamic.

🔫 Familiar Weapon Set
Players have access to a variety of classic weapons from the Half-Life series, including the crowbar, shotgun, and crossbow, all of which perform as expected. Each weapon has its own strategic value, and they all function well within the confines of the deathmatch setting.

🛠️ Modding Support and Custom Servers
As with other Source engine games, Deathmatch: Source allows for a robust modding community. Players can easily find custom servers and user-created content, from new maps to modified gameplay modes, keeping the experience fresh.

What Could Be Better?
❌ Limited Popularity and Player Base
Despite its solid foundation, Half-Life: Deathmatch: Source suffers from a relatively small player base. As newer games in the genre continue to dominate, it can be difficult to find active matches, especially in more niche servers.

❌ Physics Can Feel Clunky
While the Source engine improved many aspects of the game, some of the physics—especially in terms of movement—can feel a little awkward compared to modern shooters. The transition to 3D space feels a bit more restrictive than anticipated, particularly when compared to the fluidity of more modern games.

❌ No Significant Gameplay Innovation
While the updated graphics and better physics are great, Deathmatch: Source doesn't introduce any major changes to the original formula. It feels more like a polished port rather than a revolutionary step forward for the genre. Players expecting something drastically new may be disappointed.

❌ Lack of Meaningful Progression
Like many classic deathmatch games, there’s a lack of meaningful progression or any form of unlockable content. While this keeps the focus on pure skill-based play, some players may miss the more modern systems that reward long-term engagement.

Conclusion
Half-Life: Deathmatch: Source is a solid multiplayer shooter for fans of the classic Half-Life experience. Its updated visuals and iconic weapons deliver the fun, high-speed action that fans love, but its small player base and lack of major innovation hold it back from achieving greater popularity. If you’re looking for nostalgic deathmatch action or enjoy modding, it’s a great choice, but don’t expect a revolutionary experience.

Rating: 7/10 – Fun for fans of classic shooters, but somewhat limited by its age and player base. 🎮💥 | Half Life 1'in klasik ve efsanevi ölüm maçı modu oyunu.

Вождение стало более ""аркадным"", более простым, однако вместе с тем неписей сделали более ""злыми"", как бы вы их не разбивали, и как бы далеко от них не уезжали, уже за следующим поворотом вас догонит какой-нибудь ДЖЕК, подрежет и перегонит, геймплей более напряженный, но вместе с тем более топорный, что расстраивает, неписей кстати наделили личностями и характерами и, если у вас получится сделать скриншот между загрузочных экранов (в чём я очень сомневаюсь) вы сможете прочитать о них.

The destructible environments, incredible physics engine, and the sheer satisfaction of smashing into opponents set it apart.

While the visuals might feel dated by today’s standards, the energetic and dynamic gameplay more than makes up for it. If you’re a fan of arcade racing games, FlatOut 2 is an absolute must-play. | Ну как тут не рекомендовать эту игру?

76561197970698176,2600,Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines,0.8,Action,0,"There are few games that manage to transcend their medium, leaving a lasting impact on the players who experience them. Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines is one of those rare gems—an immersive, darkly compelling RPG that takes you deep into a world of nightmarish intrigue, complex morality, and unforgettable characters. Released in 2004, it may have been ahead of its time, but it has since become a beloved classic, and for good reason. This is a game that not only captures the spirit of its source material but builds a world so rich, so nuanced, that it feels alive.

A World of Shadows and Secrets
From the moment you step into the shoes of a freshly turned vampire, Bloodlines introduces you to a world that is both beautifully sinister and intricately detailed. Set in modern-day Los Angeles, the game weaves a dark tale of political intrigue, personal conflict, and supernatural terror. The rich lore of the Vampire: The Masquerade tabletop RPG is brought to life in an almost seamless way, with each faction of vampires—whether it's the stoic Ventrue, the cunning Malkavians, or the fiery Brujah—adding layers of complexity to the story. This is a world where nothing is ever simple, and where every decision you make carries weight.

The setting itself, the urban sprawl of LA, is a masterwork of gothic atmosphere. The game’s locations—be it the seedy alleyways of Santa Monica or the terrifying depths of the haunted asylum—are meticulously crafted, with a level of detail that makes every corner feel like it holds a secret. You’re not just moving through a city; you’re navigating a sprawling, living ecosystem of power struggles and hidden threats.

Immersive Role-Playing Like No Other
What truly sets Bloodlines apart from other RPGs is its depth of character interaction and role-playing opportunities. The game is all about choice—and not just in how you approach combat or quests, but in how you choose to live your life as a vampire. Will you uphold the delicate balance of the Masquerade, hiding your true nature from humanity, or will you embrace your monstrous side and sow chaos? These choices aren’t just for show; they impact the way you’re treated by the various factions, your relationships with other characters, and even the game’s ending. There are no easy answers here, and that’s what makes it so compelling.

The character creation system is robust, allowing you to craft a vampire that fits your playstyle. You can invest in a variety of abilities, from brutal physical combat to stealthy persuasion and hacking skills. The power of your clan also plays a significant role in how you approach different challenges, and the supernatural abilities you gain as a vampire offer a variety of ways to approach problems. Whether you want to manipulate minds, become a fearsome force in combat, or sneak past enemies unnoticed, Bloodlines gives you the freedom to build your vampire exactly how you envision them.

A Story That Binds You
But it’s not just the gameplay that shines—it’s the narrative. Bloodlines offers a gripping, multi-layered story that is filled with moral ambiguity, unforgettable characters, and moments of genuine emotional weight. Whether you're trying to navigate the political machinations of the vampire factions or diving into a personal quest that challenges your own morals, the plot is constantly shifting and evolving. The main story is full of twists and turns, but it’s the side stories—the personal journeys of the NPCs—that really elevate the game. These characters are deeply written and full of life, each with their own motivations, quirks, and tragic backstories.

The voice acting is phenomenal, bringing every character to life with nuances and emotions that make them feel real. Whether you’re talking to a wise old vampire or a desperate fledgling, the dialogue is always engaging and never feels forced. The writing, sharp and often darkly humorous, helps bring out the personality of every character you encounter, from the charming yet treacherous LaCroix to the lovable, eccentric hacker, Jeanette.

Combat and Gameplay Mechanics
The combat system in Bloodlines is a bit divisive, but it offers a unique approach to RPG combat. While the shooting mechanics can feel clunky at times, the game’s strength lies in its flexibility. You can choose to avoid combat altogether, relying on your social skills to navigate tense situations or solve problems through dialogue and subterfuge. But when the fighting does come, the visceral action makes you feel the power of being a vampire, whether you’re tearing through enemies with claws or using dark blood magic to overwhelm your foes.

The game also offers a range of side quests that are surprisingly rich in content, giving you more than just a diversion from the main story. Whether you’re helping a fellow vampire find their lost item or delving into a creepy mystery, these quests help flesh out the world and deepen your immersion.

A Timeless Classic
Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines is a game that continues to stand the test of time. Despite its technical issues at launch—many of which were patched over the years—the story, world-building, and complex characters remain as captivating as ever. This is a game that rewards patience, allowing you to sink hours into its rich narrative and immersive world. It’s a rare gem that doesn't just entertain, but challenges you, makes you think, and makes you feel the weight of every choice.

In a gaming landscape often dominated by shallow experiences, Bloodlines is a deep, meaningful RPG that still feels like a living, breathing world full of possibilities. It’s a game that hooks you with its dark allure and doesn’t let go. If you haven’t experienced Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines yet, you owe it to yourself to dive into this haunting, unforgettable adventure.

In short: an essential masterpiece, where darkness and storytelling converge into something truly special. | The most sheer aura per square-meter ever put into an rpg. Already craving for something with a similar feel but there really just isn't, shame the sequel seems to be going downhill. 

Btw if you love the setting as much as i did go check out some of the other World Of Darkness stuff (Mage is a personal fav) and delve into the lore, you're in for helluva good time. | This game is absolutely amazing. After I bought it I had it lying around for quite a while, after I finished it for the first time, I immediatly started a second run. The story is great, the voice acting is great, the dialogue is great, the atmosphere is great... Only the combat requires some getting used to and you can definitely not ignore combat especially towards the later half of the game. Overall this game is a timeless piece of art, and once you meet it on it's own terms you'll fall in love with it too. 
(still definitely get the unoffical patch though) | О старый играх с культовым статусом говорить сложно, в особенности в той ситуации, когда в самом популярном онлайн-магазине в лице Стима продается едва играбельная версия сабжа, которую, по факту, рекомендовать не стоит, хотя бы по причине того, что в Гоге вам предложат купить то же самое, но с фанатским патчем (хоть и базовым) из коробки и раза в три дешевле (если учитывая скидки на текущий момент). Но окей, я буду соблюдать Маскарад вместе с остальными старперами тут, нарисую ""синий"" отзыв и скажу то, что говорят все: [u][b]""Таких игр сейчас не делают""[/b][/u].

Иронично, что дотянулся я до игры недавно: по факту, уже после знакомства с НРИ-оригиналом, я накатил базовый патч, проглотил эту вкусняшку за Тореадора, потом еще одну порцию с расширенным за Малкавиана, облизал ложечку и попросил добавки, и все потому, что соус из фанатской поддержки все делает едой, не иначе. И сижу с невыразимой тоской на физиономии, ведь ""раньше было лучше"".

Помимо технического состояния, поругать игру есть за что. Но есть одно ""но"": такую игру даже близко днем с огнем не сыщешь, особенно на крупнобюджетной сцене. Это просто шедеврище, с уютными небольшими локациями, уймой запоминающихся персонажей и квестов, необычной механикой развития персонажа и многими другими прелестями и, как ни банально, жирной, стекающей с экрана атмосферой. А музыка-то какая, дорогие каиниты! В клубе Asp Hole можно часами сидеть, слушая один и тот же трек Tiamat. Отдельная конфетка - общая глубина некоторых аспектов игры; так, выбор клана буквально может целиком поменять примерно все ощущение от процесса. Повторю уже знакомую многим рекомендацию: в первый раз играйте кем угодно, КРОМЕ Малка, чтобы во второй раз пойти именно за него. Под Малкавиана переписаны все диалоги в игре, но знаете, что самое классное? Это крайне редкий опыт выбора между ""притворяться пришибленным"" и ""быть пришибленным"". И это просто восхитительно.  

Игра - это здоровский трип в начало нулевых, когда мы сами были мелкотой, и наши родители старательно соблюдали свой Маскарад, чтобы не показывать нам мрачные элементы тогдашней жизни, из-за чего не самые спокойные и благополучные времена овеяны ностальгией; и вот, мы сами теперь взрослые, и теперь нам тоже придется придерживаться этого Маскарада - уже для наших младших, детей, племянников и прочих, чтобы и они вошли в свой взрослый возраст с теплыми воспоминаниями о прошлом... А мы будем запускать всякое офигенное старье и недовольно ворчать на современные игры.

友情提示:
1.游戏购买的话强烈建议买Titan Quest Gold这个大包,商店地址:
http://store.steampowered.com/sub/402/
包含了泰坦之旅原版及其资料片不朽王座(相比原版增加了第九种专精梦幻之境,超大的第五幕冥界地图及对应的剧情,新增神器栏位及大量装备等等)
2.黄金版默认优先级最高的语言是德语,如果客户端使用简体中文或者繁体中文的话,将游戏语言改成英文或者将客户端语言切成英语
3.推荐资料:泰坦百科JOYGAO,在百度泰坦之旅吧右侧的公共网盘有下载,有地图/技能/装备说明等资料,帮助上手

因为不朽王座需要在原版的基础上运行,所以将原版的测评加到这里避免发两个内容类似的测评,下面是正式内容:
泰坦之旅是一款个人认为非常优秀的ARPG,拥有广阔的地图，史诗般的冒险旅程，细致的场景，独特的音乐，以及丰富的搭配。
1.游戏世界及场景:游戏世界包括了五个章节地图,(I)希腊(II)埃及(III)东方(IV)奥林匹斯山(V)冥界。前三章节基本取材于现实世界,以欧洲的地中海地区+非洲与亚洲为基础构建,有很多著名的场景例如雅典城、斯芬克斯像、空中花园、长城、长安城等等，而后两章则是以神话背景为主,(IV)奥林匹斯山作为原版的BOSS战地图只有一个场景,(V)冥界则是资料片新增内容,比之前的章节地图都要大且复杂一些,同时难度也远比之前要高。场景有缺点但更多的是优点:因为对于火焰和闪电特效的优化不足，部分场景存在着卡顿的问题（主要在第三章和第五章后面的少数场景）,不过还好大多数情况是流畅的并且有补丁可以一定程度改善。值得一提的是即使很多地方玩家不一定注意到，制作组还是将游戏的场景细节处理的非常不错,例如各个场景中摆放的工艺品及壁画装饰等等.
2.剧情:泰坦之旅的主线剧情和很多奇幻风格的游戏一样是一路成长斩妖除魔,看似平淡却不平凡.主角最开始只是名普通的冒险者,随着冒险的展开,击败了一个个强大的敌人，人们眼中可怕无比的怪物甚至高不可攀的神最终也被击败,游戏的名字Titan Quest我觉得起的非常不错，主角完成了他自己的泰坦之旅,最终成为一名被人歌颂事迹的英雄,玩家也目睹这一切,其中的艰辛与成就感相信可以在游戏过程中慢慢体会出。主线剧情有三个难度，普通、史诗与传奇，想要完全通关一个角色必须先后通关这三个难度。支线部分则轻松许多,多是帮助路过的城镇的局民解决一些问题或者是探索一些地方的宝藏,奖励也很丰厚可以多做一些.
3.人物/怪物:制作组将很多历史与神话故事里面的人物加入到游戏当中作为npc,其中一些还设计了与之相关的任务.可惜的是很多人物只是借用了一个名字且只有一些人物设计了单独的模型。而相比之下怪物种类设计就多样并且很多有鲜明的地域性,例如米诺斯迷宫中的公牛怪,尼罗河附近手持矛或法杖的鳄鱼怪,长安城皇宫中的兵马俑.
4.音乐及音效:泰坦之旅的音效相对来说中规中矩，我感觉不错的包括一些被动技能触发、锤类武器打击怪物时的音效，剩下的就先不说了。主要说下音乐。游戏针对不同场景设计了与场景十分搭配的音乐,例如山洞/迷宫/雪山,不同章节（希腊/埃及/东方/冥界）的背景音乐也有着明显的风格差异,我觉得比较好听且说得上名字的音乐是初期在希腊的When God Falls(游戏中更轻柔些且没有歌词)([url=http://www.xiami.com/song/1770541533]试听[/url])与后期领主那里的Rock Of Mages([url=http://yun.baidu.com/s/1dDfmVBF]试听[/url])。BOSS战的时候也跟据章节及BOSS种类设计了多种背景音乐,营造出一种紧张的氛围。
5.技能与装备:游戏共有九个专精,包括偏战系的战斗/防御/狩猎专精,偏法系的风暴/大地/死灵专精与偏辅助的梦幻/自然/盗贼专精。人物总共可以选择两个专精(分别在2级与8级),专精选择好后即有独特职业名(共36种双专精职业与9种单专精职业)。技能方面采用了专精条+技能树的设计,升级与任务获得的技能点数将用于专精点数及技能点数上,如果想要学习一个技能就必须学会其技能数的基础技能(如果有的话)并达到相应的专精条高度,这就需要玩家在属性(专精条加成)与技能威力(技能等级)之间进行权衡,保证尽量在整个游戏过程中有足够的输出及安全性。!!不过要注意的是!!，因为有了专精条占用了大量的技能点数，前期的输出技能可能比较单调甚至没有以甚至只有武器普通攻击,可能会带来较少的乐趣.游戏的装备非常多样,配合技能有非常多搭配。怪物的技能也非常多样性，包括技能的特效，伤害类型都进行了设计，造就出了很多杀手级的怪物，一不注意就有可能被这些拥有强力技能的怪物杀死返回重生泉，BOSS的技能相当强力，在传奇难度下有的BOSS甚至有将角色满血秒杀的能力。从寻宝游戏的角度来看,泰坦之旅的装备比较多样性,独特装备较多,且掉落几率相对较高(百分之几至千分之几的居多),而且多亏了游戏""怪物装备什么掉落什么""的设定,可以通过和周围同种怪物的外观区别来迅速识别出想要的装备,寻宝的效率大大提高,同时又有一些珍惜的词缀与装备底材搭配,出现了一些""浮云装备""来供寻宝者们挑战收集.是一款非常不错的寻宝类型的游戏.
6.MOD:优秀的MOD可以延续游戏的生命,为游戏注入新的活力,泰坦之旅的MOD方面做的还算不错,个人推荐一个很不错的MOD叫SoulVizier,这个MOD在原来游戏的基础上增加了大量的新装备与部分技能,平衡了一些专精,因为装备与人物技能的思路与之前并无太大差异,所以在对于游戏有了一定的基础后可以尝试这个MOD.

强烈推荐

十周年版
http://store.steampowered.com/app/475150 | Titan Quest, and its worthy expansion Immortal Throne is, imo, part of the holy trinity in ARPG's along side Diablo and Dungeon Siege. Titan Quests theme is unique, and the gameplay is so faithful to the principles that made diablo so great.
There is a massive, diverse world covered in several acts. In combination with tons of loot in the suspected qualities to keep the flow of the game intact. On top of that, the game also follows the model of increased difficulty (normal, epic, legendary), remeniscent of Diablo's normal, nightmare and hell. Each difficulty features harder monsters and better loot.

If at one point, you would get tired of the original campaign, you can try some of the fantastic mods available, especially Lilith: Battle for Jalavin (a totally newly created world which will take you up to 20 hours to complete). This mod in combination with other well known TQ mods such as Masteries mod (skill overhaul mod), gives more than enough incentive to go through the whole experience all over again with a fresh new slate.

All in all, if you are a fan of ARPG's it is a genuine crime not to have this masterpiece. The majority of the now-closed TQ studio (Iron Lore) are in the process of making a spiritual succesor named Grim Dawn (by Crate Entertainement). Given their history with TQ, this is a title to keep in mind as well and currently available through early acces on steam.

Closing advice: go spend money on this, preferably as soon as possible, you will not regret it. | Пожалуй одна из лучших Hack'n'Slash RPG. Которая может сравниться с мастодонтом жанра Diablo и даже в чём-то её обыграть. Например :
* Большой простор для создания собственного класса. Воин-Маг, Лучник-Убийца, Маг со щитом - пожалуйста, создавайте и отыгрывайте свой класс. Сколько я много в эту игру играл, а все комбинации так и не испробовал. 
* Мир более проработан, локации не представляют собой рандомно созданные пещеры или леса, а созданные вручную места, так, что бродить по ним не приедается даже после n-ого по счёту прохождения.
* Удачная адаптация Древнегреческих, Египетских и Китайских мифов в которых мы принимаем непосредственное участие. Раньше до того как не опробовал игру, я и не мог себе представить, что Hack'n'Slash + Мифы Древней Греции могут быть чем-то толковым, но я ошибался.
* Титаническое количество лута, как обычного так и уникального (у которого существует несколько градаций), причем на первой сложности все предметы вы не сможете найти, с новой сложностью становятся доступными для нахождения новые более мощные предметы. 

Короче говоря мне не стыдно поставить в один ряд такие две игры как Titan Quest и Diablo так, как каждая из них обладает своими неоспоримыми достоинствами. | Titan Quest is almost ten years old, but it's still one the best action RPGs out there.  

Pros:
Great skill system offers a TON of replayability
Good in-game mythos based on real life mythology
Excellent variety of enemies to fight
Well-balanced loot drops (not too much, not too little)
Some uber-bosses only in appear in harder difficulties giving you incentive to play through again

Cons:
No map randomization
No instanced loot in multiplayer
Game stutters once in a while even on modern computers

If you like action RPGs grab it next time it's on sale, or hell, grab it now! It's worth every cent.","Titan Quest Gold is a great game, and I highly recommend it."

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Writing & Worldbuilding[/h3]
Titan Quest’s ancient Fantasy setting, spanning from Greece to African regions and even higher planes of existence such as Hades (Hell) and Elysium (Heaven), is overall detailed, consistent and well-made visually and artistically. Despite its age, the visuals hold up well enough, and the ragdoll physics add some dynamicity to an otherwise very static combat feel. If you enjoy historical settings, you’ll feel right at home. 

Given that deep, meaningful plots are never a priority in this genre, efforts have been made in other iconic titles to, at least, grant a semblance of interest to the various tasks at hand, take Diablo II for example. That doesn’t happen in Titan Quest, however. Whereas the main story is generic but serviceable, any and all side characters or quests are inconsequential—their middle school grade writing only worsens the dullness of tasks already repetitive by nature. You’ll find no interest whatsoever in any of the admittedly iconic characters you’ll meet, such as great ancient heroes and even demigods, all stripped of any pathos or epicness they may have had.

[h3]Exploration & Secrets[/h3]
You’ll explore each area on foot, your only means of transport besides two-way portals that allow fast-travel to discovered locations, such as cities, to sell loot, use facilities and restock consumables—the standard ARPG fare. Notably, quest givers aren’t highlighted when it’s time to return a completed quest, so good luck remembering where “Generic NPC I Forgot The Name Of’’ is located. The average speed of your character is inadequate to traverse any area in a decent time; with how large each map is, you’ll find yourself walking more than fighting, since enemy density is subpar. You’ll often ask yourself when the current area will end, because you’re fed up with it already.

Each map has plenty of side-areas and dungeons that often host Elite or Boss enemies guarding higher-tier chests that have a chance to spawn the best loot. Exploring is worthwhile to mop up as much XP as you can, but not so much for loot since most chests, including “secret” ones, have miserable rewards. The satisfaction of finding a secret dungeon, clearing it and getting some actual good loot from it is almost always absent.

[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]
The combat gameplay, of course, will change based on your Masteries (classes) of choice, ranging from pure casters to summoners, melee specialists, archers, rogues, and why not, a mix of all the above. The amount of combinations is staggering, with a relatively cheap respec option available at any town for skills. The standard ARPG system of mana, health and related potions is in place, plus an array of consumable Scrolls that have a variety of unique effects, purchased for a high price or rarely found. Should you perish in combat, a feat not easy to achieve due to the generally tame challenge posed by your foes, an XP penalty is applied, having you return to your death-mark to reclaim it; nothing else is lost.

The cooldowns. Good lord the cooldowns. Of any ARPG I have played, Titan Quest takes the cake for the slowest, most infuriating cooldown timers. Whoever thought a 30 seconds cooldown on the basic Taunt skill for a tank (which doesn’t work properly half the time anyway) or even 60 second ones on caster skills were good ideas, should take a break from game development and play some Diablo II to see how it’s done.

Even if the enemy variety is good in a general sense, most maps overextend and bloat for too long, having you fight countless of the same fodder far past what would be ideal for this genre. The Elite and Boss enemies aren’t unique or meaningful enough to grant the needed diversity. Speaking of higher-tier enemies, unless you go against one that is twenty levels above you, you won’t have much problems dealing with them, at least on the default difficulty setting. Most of them are miserable, generic, and just don’t stand out enough from the crowd save for some different color or aura around them. I died a total of five times in the whole game, which isn’t a lot. 

[h3]Character Progression[/h3]
By killing enemies and completing quests, you’ll level up and receive 3 Skill and 2 Attribute points each time. You can also get these as quest rewards, alongside other unique bonuses like +% damage, but that’s a rare occurrence. 

You’ll also loot charms from enemies and chests, which can be used on weapons to bestow passive traits that compound your build, and also reused by destroying the weapon to get the charm back and then put it on a better one.

Leveling up in Titan Quest is tremendously slow: by the end of the campaign, after doing everything, I was just level 37; the level cap is 75. That’s less than one level per hour, which may be fine for the last 10-20 levels in an ARPG, when your build is already shaped up, but it’s a depressing affair so early. Your gameplay evolves slowly, frustratingly so: your combat experience will stay the same for hours on end if you decide to focus on a few skills, which is the only way to make them worth using to begin with. Also, you’ll also have to spend skill points to increase your Mastery level and access higher tier skills, further sinking more points into passive stats instead of active skills that evolve your class’ gameplay. | I fully recommend this game. Read on if you want to know why.

The pros:
Although this game was released in 2006 the graphics are still holding up with nowadays games.
But not only the graphics are great even the artstyle is an outstandig masterpiece.
It's not too dark or too colorful.
The game is set in pre-roman ironage mixed up with mythologie.
It's a really well fitiing and unspent setting.
The character progression and skilling is interesting.
The sound ambient and music is well made and catching.
The developer delivered all of the tools the games have been made with, so you can make your own Titan Quest mod or total conversion.

The cons:
The controls feel a bit clumpy. You often get stuck on small clutter on the ground you're barely seeing.
The game doesn't recognize when you're pressing multiple buttons at once for activating skills for example.
This can be the reason why you die rather quickly and thats frustrating.
Sometimes the frames drop at a low rate when special effects like rain or snow are showing.
Even though you can expand your bag the room to hoard stuff is very limited. You need to use third-party-tools like TQVault to expand you stash.
This also applies to the attributes like strength, dexterity, intelligence etc. You need to use third-party-tools to reset them.
The devs have added some lategame contenct but it's not enough to keep the players busy imo.

All in all it's a great game that you should play. | [h1]Один из лучших дьяблоидов[/h1]
Игровой процесс заключается в том, что мы уничтожаем монстров, собираем выпавшие вещи и продвигаемся дальше. Поднимая вещи лучшего качества, или повышая уровень, мы можем в тот же момент ощутить превосходство над обитателями. Да и самих обитателей огромное множество видов из разных мифологий. Хоть это и звучит банально, игра сильно увлекательна.

Ключевой особенностью игры является то, что мы не выбираем класс персонажа вначале, а формируем его сами, выбирая две школы, что даёт огромное число вариантов развития. К тому же каждая школа подразумевает несколько стилей игры. Гениальная система позволяет собрать персонажа под себя.

Локации красивые и разнообразны. Греческие поля, Египетские пустыни, Гималайские горы, Китайские джунгли, Небесные чертоги и владения Аида. Все они созданы вручную и приятны для исследования.

По поводу сюжета сказать ничего не могу, т.к. играл с друзьями и они так быстро брутфорсили игру, что не то что диалоги почитать, описания предметов читать не успевал. Возможно, познакомлюсь с историей в другой раз. 

А вот багов (которые, как говорят, присутствуют в основном при игре по сети) в игре больше, чем хотелось бы. Пропадания текста, неработающие порталы, подвисания, пропадающие квестовые предметы. В среднем за сессию приходилось раза 3 пересоздавать.

Рекомендую, особенно в кампании друзей! | Un jeu d'une intensité et d'une durée de vie exceptionnelle pour petits et grands! | Bu tarz oyunlardan Baldur's Gate 1, Dungeon Siege 1 ve 2' yi oynadım.

Çantadaki fazla eşyaları kolaylıkla  teleport oluşturup bir mekana ışınlanarak satıp, savaş alanına geri dönebiliyorsun. Heme de sınırsız. Yok ışınlanma parşömeni gerekiyor, o parjömene de bir dünya para vereceksin falan öyle bir dert yok. Oyunu daha bitirmedim. Zorluk seviyesi de seçmedim. Varsa da nasıl seçiliyor henüz bilmiyorum. Belki zorluk seviyesinden dolayı böyledir. Fakat yine de beni başlangıç olarak diğer oyunlara göre fazla yormadı. Kesinlikle tavsiye edeceğim bir oyun.",4K display.

Pack renovado por Nightdive Studios de los dos primeros Doom, con un montón de mejoras y añadidos para disfrutarlo mejor que nunca. 

Como ya sabréis la mayoría, Doom supuso una auténtica revolución en el mundo de los videojuegos al ser uno de los más influyentes juegos de disparos en primera persona  de la historia, siendo prácticamente el origen de la popularidad del género; por su apartado gráfico revolucionario con sus texturas detalladas y especialmente su entorno 3D con una inmersión nunca vista hasta la fecha; por su modo multijugador que permitía jugar a través de LAN, lo cual fue todo un avance en el mundillo de los videojuegos; y también por el variado diseño de la gran cantidad de niveles laberínticos de los que disponía, llenos de secretos.

A pesar de que Doom salió en 1993, acabo de pasármelo completándolo al 100% y he de decir de que a pesar del paso del tiempo y de que como es lógico a nivel gráfico se ha quedado completamente desfasado, sigue siendo uno de los juegos más adictivos y frenéticos que puedes encontrar en la actualidad.

Este pack incluye: Doom I, Doom II, TNT: Evilution, The Plutonia Experiment, Master Levels for Doom II, No rest for the Living, Sigil y Legacy of Rust, un nuevo episodio totalmente exclusivo. Esto nos asegura una cantidad enorme de horas de juego, más si queremos encontrar los secretos de los niveles o conseguir el 100% de logros disponibles. 

Además de todo este contenido, tiene mejoras en cuando al apartado gráfico, gracias al motor gráfico KEX que permite una mejor renderización, pudiendo usar resoluciones de hasta 4K y 120FPS, además de mejoras en cuanto a texturas y efectos. 

Se ha remasterizado la banda sonora, pudiendo elegir entre la versión MIDI o la nueva versión IDKFA de Andrew Hulshult (podéis disfrutarla en Spotify: [url=https://open.spotify.com/intl-es/album/2YqpDPPwqaKCoSBe36hVAe?si=eD-MuFIXSVuMkAjg1y8aCA]Banda sonora IDKFA de DOOM + DOOM II por Andrew Hulshult en Spotify[/url]. Es una auténtica maravilla el trabajo realizado, aunque como pega hay que decir también que se echa en falta que hicieran lo mismo con la BSO de TNT: Evilution o Sigil por ejemplo, que no están remasterizadas.

Sobre la nueva expansión exclusiva llamada Legacy of Rust, realizada en colaboración entre id Software, Nightdive Studios y MachineGames, incluye 16 nuevos mapas divididos en dos secciones: The Vulcan Abyss y Counterfeit Eden, añadiendo además nuevos enemigos y armas. 

A modo de resumen, mi lista de pros y contras:

[H1][b]PROS:[/b][/H1]

- 2 de los mejores FPS de todos los tiempos, que cambiaron la historia de los videojuegos para siempre

- Que hayan incluido las mejoras totalmente gratis para los que ya teníamos los clásicos en la biblioteca

- Que hayan remasterizado toda la banda sonora de Doom y Doom 2

- Es la mejor forma de disfrutar de estos clásicos

- La enorme variedad de enemigos

- La variedad de armas disponibles

- Que hayan incluido todas las expansiones

- Las mejoras para seleccionar el arma

- Compatibilidad total con mandos (para quien quiera jugarlo así, aunque con ratón + teclado es mucho mejor en mi opinión)

- Montones de horas de juego aseguradas si quieres completar el 100% de logros

- La nueva campaña Legacy of Rust, con nuevos enemigos y armas

- La ingente cantidad de secretos repartidos por los niveles

- Muy rejugable

- Los controles mejorados

- Traducido al español

- Tan divertido y frenético como antaño

- El gore

- La ingente cantidad de enemigos en pantalla al mismo tiempo

- Que tenga la opción de quicksave / quickload

- Tiene una gran cantidad de logros Steam

- Tiene sistema de guardado de la partida en la nube Steam Cloud

[H1][b]CONTRAS:[/b][/H1]

- Se echan en falta más opciones de configuración y mejoras gráficas, como el filtrado de las texturas. Solo da la opción de jugarlo con la estética retro con las texturas pixeladas, habiendo ya muchos mods que lo superan a nivel visual

- Que no se pueda mirar libremente con el ratón como ocurre como otros juegos similares remasterizados de la de la época, como Duke Nukem 3D o Blood

- Que no se pueda saltar ni agacharse, siempre fue de lo poco que no me gustó en su día de Doom y es algo que ha envejecido mal

- Es muy fácil perderse en los niveles
 
- Que no se haya remasterizado la música de TNT: Evilution ni la de Sigil entre otros

- He sufrido muchas salidas al escritorio, es bastante inestable. Hace falta pulirlo algo más

[H1]Conclusión:[/h1]
------------------------
IMPRESCINDIBLE. Doom es historia de los videojuegos, todo amante de la acción y de los FPS debe tenerlo en su biblioteca sí o sí, lo jugaras o no en su día. Una auténtica obra maestra que ha sido cuidada con mucho mimo por parte de Nightdive Studios en este pack.

Overall though, definitely worth a buy on sale. | Amazing experience.
Amazing voice acting, awesome story, great classic graphics.
Loved it.
Only thing was that you need to fool around with some files to change the resolution and controls, would wish to see some support for a game this popular.

The graphics, while from an earlier era, have aged remarkably well. The detailed unit designs and atmospheric battlefields still capture the gritty, war-torn essence of the 40k universe, immersing players in the chaos of the far future.

The game’s story and factions stay true to the Warhammer 40k lore, delivering a narrative that resonates deeply with fans. Each faction feels authentic, from the relentless march of the Necrons to the righteous fury of the Sisters of Battle, ensuring that the gameplay aligns perfectly with the dark, gothic atmosphere of the universe.

Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Soulstorm is its vibrant modding community. Over the years, dedicated fans have kept the game alive and thriving, introducing new factions, campaigns, and quality-of-life improvements. Mods like the Ultimate Apocalypse and Unification expansions breathe new life into the game, offering a fresh experience even for long-time players.

For fans of 40k and strategy games, Dawn of War: Soulstorm remains an essential classic, as compelling today as it was at launch. | The greatest warhammer RTS game of all time

The missions and difficulty are pretty unfair!
The control is bad.
The camera is glitchy.

I don't know if they rebalanced the difficulty in the Definitive Edition, but the plain old edition is pretty bad by today's standards! | The GTA 3 Improved Classic mod has bought this game back to life. It's archaic now, but there's nothing quite like speeding through the city at night while Rise FM plays in the background. | Grand Theft Auto III is like the game that introduced me to a whole new level of chaos—and honestly, I haven’t been the same since. Here I am, minding my business as Claude (the silent protagonist who’s basically a walking disaster waiting to happen), when suddenly I’m driving a car at top speed, blasting through a roadblock, and stealing a tank. Oh, and let’s not forget the moment you accidentally start a gang war because you ran over someone’s foot. It’s the type of game where you start a mission and somehow end up on a 20-minute joyride, dodging cops, blowing up cars, and asking yourself, “How did this become my life?” It’s absurd, it’s wild, and it’s completely addictive.

The beauty of GTA III lies in its open-world freedom, allowing you to create your own chaotic story. You’re in Liberty City, a sprawling urban landscape full of different districts, from grimy alleyways to vibrant nightlife hubs, and you’re free to cause as much destruction as you want. Whether you’re helping (or hindering) the city’s underworld in main missions, or just cruising around causing random mayhem, the game gives you the freedom to make it your own. The mission variety is what really keeps things interesting—one minute you’re doing a high-stakes car chase, and the next, you’re on a hilarious rampage with a fire truck. The NPCs are also totally unpredictable, which always keeps you on your toes.

What makes Grand Theft Auto III a true classic is the way it captures the essence of early 2000s gaming. It was one of the first games to truly open up a city for players to explore, offering a level of immersion and freedom that was revolutionary at the time. It might not have the graphics of modern-day titles, but the gameplay, the wild unpredictability, and the sheer fun of being able to do whatever you want in Liberty City is timeless. If you’re a fan of open-world action games, or if you just want to experience the chaos and charm of one of the most influential games of its time, Grand Theft Auto III is a must-play. It’s messy, it’s hilarious, and it’s probably one of the most fun experiences you can have while breaking all the rules. | Eski bir oyun ve yeni sistemlerde zor çalışıyor. Görev dizaynı da yavan.

And it's a great experience still, holding up far better for me than the likes of [i]Braid[/i] and [i]Limbo[/i].  That's strange, since 2D was and is easier to make [i]immediately[/i] playable on a smaller dev budget.  Now, there [i]is[/i] a little jank in this, as you would expect to find in a [b]3D indie game[/b] made before there was even a real 2D indie boom -- but not nearly as much as I feared.  The wild [b]bio-punk[/b] style comes through as strong as ever without RTX/SSAO/8K textures/DLSS and whatever all the rest of the game-delaying, budget-bloating nonsense is -- and I found myself getting sucked right back in to the wacky world of Zenozoik after knocking about an even jankier and much less interesting reality for a decade-plus.

Such jank as you might experience is all baked into the game engine, primarily in the slight sense of [i]delay[/i] and the queuing you get with the melee inputs.  Ghat's main fisty combo, for instance, is set off by [b]holding[/b] the button down until it is complete, with the other button for hard attacks.

It kind of works in a [i]thematic[/i] sense, really, when you consider the savage world you're in.  Some people complain about the gun combat too, but I think it works well enough; Ghat and his big extended family mostly fight with feet and fists, and since these biopunk guns, all made of bone, stone, and sinew, take work to reload and aim, [i]of course[/i] they might feel a trifle more awkward than those in a legit FPS.  I know it sounds like trying to wallpaper flaws with an imagined [b]meta-connection[/b] between story and gameplay, but it's seriously fine and feels good when you're actually playing and soaking up all the vibes.

Back in the 2009 of its original release, a lot of people played this because there weren't a lot of options -- it just so happened to be a very good, very memorable game despite the widespread attention it incidentally received.  Nowadays, it will appeal more to the PC indie crowd I think.  It's short, engrossing, and costs as much as a sachet of corn nuts when it's on sale, so why not throw it on the ol' wishlist? | Un clasico, quizas hoy no impresione mucho, pero en el contexto de este juego es super innovador, creativo y original.

My memory of this game, of playing it off a CD, is that you could read an entire comic book waiting for a new level to load. Unfortunately that's the part of the game that has been preserved here. Bugs galore, including having actions edge off screen and characters 'dropping' through buildings making them unmovable or un-engagable. What was fun about this game originally was the campy concept and bright colors. It doesn't look right now. The bright colors and comic book dashes and dots with this early animation style doesn't scream page-turning immersive world. It's like a cheap, superficial game you'd get on a cellphone. 

The missions can be painfully simplistic and there isn't a sense of team building or world building. Your reward is largely your own imagination as you earn enough to unlock 'sets' of abilities or skills. If you're someone who wants the nostalgia either from the original release or from the really, really old comics, this might scratch the itch. If you have even slightly high standards informed by modern games, you'll be disappointed. 

The idea that something this simplistic came out in the same era as the Halo games or even the early Civilization games is a little shocking to contemplate. The people who designed it loved Patriot City and some of the 1980's kind of super villain tropes. They had fun with this, clearly, I just don't think it aged well and given the depth of both missions and conceptual design of other early 2000's games I remain shocked it was ever reviewed and ranked so highly. 

I guess get it if it's on sale or you're really, really curious about what people did when they weren't playing Quake back in the day.","I'm not sure what the hype is about this game, but I'm not sure what the hype is about. The controls are so bad that I can't tell modern gamers to buy it."

Oblivion isn't a game that you play. Oblivion is a game that you conquer.
Yes, the graphics and mechanics haven't aged well. Yes, the dialogue is often hilariously unhinged. And yes, the game is ripe with bugs and quest breaking sequences that induce a paranoid amount of saving. But its' defects can also be broken in your favor. THAT realization is when the game grips you:
What can you get away with? What cheese tactics, what exploits, or what innocuous and obscure thing (like picking up and dropping a paintbrush from your inventory... this is not a joke) can you leverage to your adventure— and how far can you leverage it? And there's so much to be adventured: every nook and cranny or every dungeon, achieve and ace every quest, grind every attribute and skill to max, collect every unique item, and then, after a 100+ hours... lament that it's over.

Which brings us to those who are returning to this title:
You know as well as I that this game has near to no replay value. Everything Oblivion has to offer can be experienced in a single playthrough, and the narrative has little to no variation (nor any substantial dialogue or narrative choices for those hopping for more RP in their RPG like the CRPGs that predated it).

It can be a hell of a ride, but with a story you can only fully revel in once, as a fresh player.
Otherwise you're only left to recall the insatiable desire to see and do everything until the memory of your previous experience is restored, which quickly dulls the experience.
However, on a personal note, I will add: that one thing I recalled was that this was one of the few games that truly made me feel as though I were fighting an endless army of demons; running, jumping, and cutting through one Oblivion gate after another...
And I felt it still, even years after its' initial release.

The character design is also superior to both, as they did away with character classes in Skyrim.

Vc controla um minerador que junta com a rebelião contra a opressão (edf) por um motivo (só isso kkk).

Pontos positivos: O jogo é de mundo aberto e se destaca com as destruições de cenários, dá pra destruir praticamente todas as estruturas. O legal é pegar uma bazuca e fazer estragos nos prédios kkk.
Fica mais legal quando a rebelião se junta durante o tiroteio.
Não tive problema na otimização.

Pontos negativos: a história é genérica, missões secundárias ficam legais no começo e mais tarde fica cansativo, inteligência artificial dos aliados que ficam saindo do carro quando estão de carona com vc e inimigos.

OBS: Existe um modo que vc joga com SAM como se fosse dlc mas é do próprio jogo.

So if your new to the game remember that. There IS story but not really the focus, the focus of the game was it's destruction system, If you played Just Cause 2 and up it's basically that story wise and game-play wise except on mars and no flight ability. I like the game as a not so serious Legal weed edible on and off game. I play it to blow stuff up in creative ways and not think too much about anything else. If you play on above normal thou be prepared to kill many people as the enemy may and will drown you in themselves and watch ammo. Try and not to be too sympathetic about allies dying as they are as dumb as they can be and show up often without request and are at best expendable distraction, they can also make things worse if your trying to be selective in your destruction. The best way to save them is to not see them die and lose your alert level.

The game for what it is....Is simple. What you do in the game you will be doing till the end of it with enough upgrades and story to get you to it's end. A classic with flaws to be sure but in terms of entertainment it's sure to be better than nothing and worth a grab on sale or full price. The game after this one is not worth buying. | Aw man, this is probably one of the best games from the 7th console generation. This is THE example of gameplay over narrative.

Would it be better with a good story? Sure, maybe... But does a game with destruction mechanics that are still highly intricate and advanced 15+ years later really need to have a deep story? Mindlessly smash and explode your problems away until you bring down the entire political system of Mars.

Red Faction Guerrila was a simple game with a simple story but a enjoyable one with a couple of things that could have some better design choices. Right from the the start you know what to expect in the game. You know what areas there is to explore and what to do to restore them to what they were before thing gone bad. The EDF is here and they are not welcome, the barricades, the defenses, the turrents, all most be gone and lucky for you, you will have a great arsenal to make things easier. There are 6 areas for you to focus in the main story and plenty of side activities to keep you busy but not enough for you to get burn out doing them all. I finished around 30 activities and after that I felt I've seen everything there was to see and the remaining would be more copy and paste without anything new so I stopped doing them and went back to the main story.  

Performance wise I only got a crash to the desktop and it was during the DLC main mission. Aside of that, when exiting the game I got a black screen a couple of times, nothing serious. Pushing the FOV to the max makes the game feels so much better, I highly recommend it. Gameplay wise it's a solid game but could have better mechanics. The cars feel a little too stiff when cornering and wobbly on the desert segments. Guns are more than enough and it does not get old destrying everything. Be cautious of how you use them because the AI allies tend to be a little too close for you and sometimes when swinging the hammer the worst can happen. It wouldn't be too bad if you didn't get a morale penalty when your allies die. Speaking of dying, you also get lower morale when you die so if you are dying too much just drop the difficulty down and you'll be good to go. The music feels good and gave me some Mad Max vibes. The world does not offer much variety and cut-scenes could be better looking but it's normal considering the initial release of the game.
 
12 hours after, I finished the main game with some side activities. The DLC is well worth your time and it's a quick one with around 2 more hours from start to finish. I got all the activities and main missions as well destroying everything in the DLC in two gaming sessions.","The game is a bit better than the original, but it is still a bit better than the original."

I've played a lot of ARPGs in my time and this game just isn't good, not with the lots of other games there are nowadays and that were there even during its time. I didn't go into it with wanting to dislike it, but have not really found many things to like, or at the very least enough for me to like the game, enjoy my experience, and give it a positive review.

I'm not a fan of the graphics, but that's always been the least important aspect when it comes to games for me, but I can't believe this game is from 2009 judging from... well, everything. The graphics didn't age well (looks like a cheap mobile game), amount of classes (3?!), mechanics, skills and skill trees (every class has 15 active and 15 passive skills), loot (a lot of trash drops) and the controls and combat - very clunky, I tried playing a Vanquisher (kind of a Rogue/Marksman class) and the ranged attacks usually either didn't even connect or only had range for about half the screen.

I'd have expected the game to be at least 10 years older than that, everything just feels so lackluster and jank for its time. If it were, I wouldn't have been so harsh with the review but simply put, there were games that were miles ahead at the time - Titan Quest or Diablo II, which lo and behold, are still very good and playable to this day, even in spite of being older.

There are some nice ideas, like the pet, being able to send it back to town to sell your items. If only the inventory wasn't 3x7, while also having to carry scrolls and potions, making it at least 4 slots smaller. Other than that though, the pet is just basically a way worse and dumbed-down version of the Diablo II mercenary. The only other ""good"" thing about the game is that you can mod it and the mods don't disable steam achievements, at least the ones I installed. This would be good if the base game itself was good and if some mods just didn't feel mandatory to make the experience less painful.

Now if we move on to the cons, other than everything already mentioned above, there is no respec, why? Yes, there is a mod for it, but still. There were games before its time that had this mechanic, so why does this game not have it?

I am playing in very hard softcore and the game still feels very easy regardless of that, which brings me to the balance being very poor - still remember my first death, which was to a trapped chest dealing over 50% of my health in a zone 5 levels below me, while literally every single other trap I've triggered dealt about 1/10 of the damage of this one, pretty much not even moving my health bar. I just don't get it. On top of that, the monster damage on very hard gets absurd very quickly, even before completing the story you're gonna start getting constantly oneshot with very little counterplay, unless you're of course kiting around half the map and standing half a screen away from the mobs.

This game didn't bring anything new at the time that would be meaningful and worthwhile enough to mention. Unless you're going into the game with extremely strong nostalgia, can't recommend. It is cheap though, so I'll at least give it that. | . São 3 personagens fixos e sem nome, não tem como customizar a aparência, cada um é uma classe diferente. 
. A mulher usa armas de fogo, o grandalhão é o berserker e o magrelo é o mago.
. Na árvore de habilidades, existem 3 abas para cada um, sendo possível criar builds diferentes sempre que for jogar e também usar armas de outras classes, basta possuir os status necessários para empunhar a arma.
. No início escolhemos um pet, lobo ou lince. E ele ajuda muito durante o gameplay, porque tanka os inimigos, pode se transformar em monstros de acordo com o tipo de peixe que você o alimentar, equipa acessorios, sobe de level, usa magias, pega itens no chão pra você, vende seus itens na cidade retornando até você em menos de 2min e tem inventário para carregar itens.
. São 4 níveis de dificuldade escolhido no inicio e há um modo chamado HARDCORE onde ativa a morte permanente. Sim, se morrer já era.
. Na cidade você pega quests, conversa com NPCs, vende e compra itens, há 2 baús para guardar seus itens sendo que um serve para guardar itens compartilhando-os com seus outros chars criados. Mas char normal não compartilha itens com char hardcore.
. Gameplay é muito baseado em Diablo onde você vai nas dugeons, andar por andar explorando em visão aérea tipo no League of Legens, inclusive os gráficos lembram muito a versão antiga do LoL.

Eu achei muito viciante e desafiador no modo HARDCORE. Recomendo! Nota 9/10 | [h1] Cozy ARPG for fans of Diablo 1[/h1]
[h3] Should play well on almost all systems [/h3]

I love this game. I used to play it on my low spec netbook that struggled even running chrome, it ran this game well. There are a ton of better ARPGs out there, but none of them are as ""minimalist"" as this one. Single dungeon with multiple levels, basic classes and skills, small town with quest givers. It is a bare bones ARPG and that is not necessarily a bad thing. Not having to stress over synergies (non existent) complex skill trees (as basic as they come) makes this game perhaps the coziest ARPG out there. 

[b]Not recommended if you are looking for deep game mechanics, complex builds or modern quality of life improvements. [/b]



 | Torchlight is a simple and solid Dungeon Crawler, held back by a lack of QOL aswell as an atrocious difficulty spike in the later part of the game that killed the enjoyment for me.
Despite some hiccups, Torchlight is still a really fun budget title. I recommend it on a sale. The only thing that would complete this game for me is if it had multiplayer, but Torchlight 2 has it, so maybe you'd want to pick up that one instead. | Decent and fun diablo-type game, but a lot easier to get into.

Genel anlamda internet ortamında açıkça ve rahatlıkla eleştiri yapacak bir düzeye gelmişken ayrıca bir çok şeye tek bir tıkla ulaşıp araştırma imkanınız varken kendi fikirlerinizi oluşturmayıp neden başkalarından duyduğunuz şeyleri savunuyor ve insanlara yanlış algılar hediye ediyorsunuz ?

Yapmayın..

""Gerekli laf söyleme kısmını geçtiğimi göre şimdi oyundan bahsedebiliriz""

Her şeyin başlangıcı olarak verilmese de karakteri tanımamız ve hikayeyi anlayabilmemiz için gerekli oyun olarak karşımıza çıkıyor Witcher 1.

Çok güzel bir senaryo hazırlanmış öncesi hakkında bir fikrimiz yok sonrası ise tamamen muamma ilerledikçe kendimize ve hikayeye dair ip uçları ediniyor ve bir şekilde kafamızda yaşananları şekillendirmeye başlıyoruz.

[spoiler]Oyunun en başında karşımıza çıkan çocuğun en sonunda karşımıza çıkacağını kim bilebilir ki ?[/spoiler]

Oyun sırasında çok fazla npc ile diyalog kurabiliyor ana karakterimiz adına seçim yapmamız gereken çok fazla sahne ile karşılaşıyoruz.

Yetenek ağacı ise gerçekten harika oynamak istediğiniz stile yatırım yaptıkça harika kombolar ve hızlandırmalar sunuyor.

Dövüş sistemi sanıldığının aksine birazcık refleks birazcık dikkatli oynamak mantığında ilerliyor yeterli upgrade'leri alırsanız karşınızdaki 10 kişiyi havada 5 takla atarak inanılmaz artist şekillerde kesebiliyorsunuz.

Görev mantığı ise harika tüm oyunlarında olduğu gibi hangisinin side hangisinin main quest olduğunu size veriyor ve en önemli kısmı o görevleri yapabilmek için sadece bulunduğunuz haritada değil başka haritalara gidip gelebiliyorsunuz.

""Emek veriyorsunuz""

Bu oyun için gerçekten emek veriyorsunuz eski olmasına rağmen tek bir anında bile beni sıkmayan başından saatlerce kalkmadığım bir oyun oldu Witcher benim için.

Her anında insanları tek tek tanımak hikayelerini dinlemek yeri geldiğinde sarhoş olup ağzınlarından laf almak yeri geldiğinde genel evdeki kızlara çiçek götürmek her anı ile gerçekten harika bir oyun Witcher 1.

Yaptığım seçimler sırasında gerçekten zorlandığım noktalar oldu ben olsam ne yapardım Gerald aslında ne yapar kısımlarında bazı seçim ekranlarında oturup düşünmüşlüğüm var ve her şeyin sonunda tamamen benim verdiğim kararlara göre şekillenmiş bir son çıktı karşıma.,

Oyun beni tatmin etti mi ? Fazlasıyla..

 | Este jogo é incrível, mas não é para todos, ele possui uma complexidade tática única, o que vai faz muita gente achar ele difícil quando na verdade se você usar a estratégia certa ele fica relativamente fácil.

[*] Gosta de RPG.
[*] Gosta de explorar.
[*] Gosta de Jogos com características táticas complexas.
[*] Gosta de jogos clássicos como os primeiros Dark Souls e Neverwinter Nights.
[*] Tem disposição para coletar e craftar itens.

[b]Evite este jogo se:[/b]
[list]
[*] Não gosta de Leitura, (Há muita coisa para ler no jogo)
[*] Não gosta de RPG ou escolhas complexas.
[*] Não gosta de ficar perdendo tempo falando com todos npcs e entrando em todos os lugares.
[*] Gosta apenas de lutar metendo a espada nos inimigos sem frescuras como magia e alquimia.
[*] Não gosta de jogos datados ou com jogabilidade estranha.
[*] Não quer perder tempo coletando e craftando itens.
[/list]

[b]Alquimia[/b]

O uso de poções não é opcional, é OBRIGATÓRIO. Neste jogo você precisa coletar itens como plantas e partes de animais, comprar e ler formulas para poções e óleos, crafta-los e usar de acordo com o contexto, inimigo e sua estratégia. Essas informações custam caro no jogo, tanto em tempo conversando com npcs quanto em ouro para comprar as formulas. 

[b]Inimigos e Combates[/b]

A parte mais divertida para mim e mais odiada para outros. No jogo você possui uma espada de prata e uma de aço, além de 3 estilos de combate, você precisa usar a arma certa no estilo de combate certo contra o inimigo certo, e juntamente com isso combinar a magia e alquimia para explorar as fraquezas dos adversários, isso é fundamental especialmente nos chefes. 

Os pontos fracos dos monstros e chefes do jogo também não são de graça, você precisa comprar livros, e falar com npcs para descobri-los, o que você pode facilmente perder durante a progressão do game ou simplesmente ficar sem dinheiro para adquirir as informações, deixando o game mais difícil e menos rico em termos de lore. De posse da informação você precisa ficar consultado o codex do jogo para elaborar as estratégias de combate. 

As coisas não explicitas no codex, por exemplo, ele diz que o chefe do primeiro capitulo é pouco vulnerável a magia Aard, se você se deu o trabalho de aprender ou usar a magia Aard em combate sabe que ela tonteia os inimigos possibilitando que você os mate com um só golpe. 

De posse dessas duas informações você pode elaborar a estratégia de fortalecer o Aard para matar o chefe ""super difícil"" do capitulo 1 com apenas um golpe.  Mas cabe ao jogador chegar nesta conclusão e planejar com antecedência. Parece algo simples mas a maioria dos jogadores não o fazem pois jogam irrefletidamente. [b]The Witcher não vai te pegar pela mão. cabe a você pegar os insumos que o jogo te oferece para ter uma boa experiência[/b].

[b]História[/b]

A lore da série witcher dispensa comentários, só não posso deixar de mencionar que em diversos momentos o jogo tem coloca entre escolhas morais de fritar a cabeça. Você sempre se pega tentando entender qual a coisa certa até se dar conta que no jogo não existe isto de coisa certa, e que ninguém é inocente.

Uma coisa importante é que a história avança de forma inesperada, é normal coisas ficarem para trás na primeira jogada, sempre tenha isso em mente ao entrar em um lugar ou completar uma quest, as vezes o jogo avança e algumas quests não podem ser completadas, outras o jogador acaba deixando passar. Desta forma o jogo tem um valor alta para quem for re-jogar. | Après avoir fini le jeu en 63h, je ne peux que le recommander.

Certes, il n'est plus au goût du jour, mais n'oublions pas qu'il date de 2008 : 

-  la fluidité des mouvements n'est pas celle d'un jeu de 2019 
-  la réactivité peut parfois être légèrement ennuyante (dégainer 3 plombes après le début du combat) 

Et pour ceux/celles qui n'aiment pas faire des allers-retours pour une quête, qui n'aiment pas prendre le temps de dialoguer pour récolter un maximum d'informations, passer votre chemin ! Par ailleurs, c'est un RPG ... il faut bien s'y attendre.  

Cependant, il reste immersif et on se laisse prendre au jeu ... et puis ... toute trilogie ne commence-t-elle pas par le 1e épisode si l'on veut en comprendre l'histoire complète ?   

N'hésitez plus ...

Sans compter que 1,19€ pour 63h de jeu (soit 0.018€ / h) ...

I have never seen a shooter punish exploration, and ammo/health resupplying as much as this game.  1 armor pickup? spawn 20 enemies. have 10 shells across the map you slowly trod your way to get? spawn in the tankiest enemies that'll eat up that ammo you just got.  I stopped collecting health pickups because i swear to fuck every single health pickup that doesn't spawn in front of you is tied to enemies that'll immediately eat it up.
I also love how they have a key rebind settings tab that doesn't let you rebind a chunk of the buttons despite them being there. quick saving is such a damn pain.

It's just fun, and you can play it for 5 minutes if that's all you got, or two hours.  No negatives, just an addicting little cartoon plane game that can hook you. | One of the best underrated multiplayer games. And it's ultra low spec.
Best part of this is the football. You got football played with planes and you can't underestimate how good that is. 
5 different planes add some good depth to it. 
If you're a beginner- it's worth finding a football server with bots, and learning how to pass and all that. Also there's a good fun tutorial prepared by altitude. 
Most common server is 14 people, and sometimes the skill level can be quite high. In which case be maybe a bit prepared for some grumpy players especially if you don't know which direction you're going, don't know how to pass, and go for enormous kill counts and neglecting the ball. 
Otherwise, enjoy one of the most underrated multiplayer games on the internet, and which is free as well. | A few years ago I had a lot of fun with this game.  Not sure if it's still alive/active or whatever and I can't exactly find out since my account is just, I don't know, gone?  It's weird.

It was really fun, though.  Like a lot of games that have an overall account level, though, it wasn't the most balanced.  Later upgrades and planes were just, you know, objectively better than starting things.  The ships aren't necessarily rock-paper-scissors in design but there are elements like that to them.  Having said that, the starting ship is probably the best one, which is good for beginners.

Regardless, the ships were balanced enough that you could play whatever and probably be fine in most situations.  The game modes were varied enough.  You had death match and team death match, yeah, but there was also a mode where you destroyed an enemy base, and another where you effectively played soccor with the space ships.  I really liked the last one, but they were all fun and I'd play whatever when I did.

Controls were fine, graphics were fine, sounds were fine.  The only problem I ever encountered were some latency issues, where people would just appear to teleport somewhere else or where you were clearly disconnecting (everyone was falling or flying into walls).

Yeah, every now and then I boot this up and try to figure out my old account, or to make my old account work, but it never happens.  Had a lot of good times and I would totally play some more, if not a lot, should I ever fix that.  Good game, if you see it on sale, do check it out.  Assuming it's still alive.  It might not be!

The edit: game is mostly dead except for old elitists, apparently.  Shame.  Guess they are a pretty closed off community and not friendly to newbs.  Oh well.  RIP altitude. | A few years back, this game was great. It had a small community but enough to make the game worth playing. As of now there's probably only a few dozen people playing.

I wouldn't recommend purchasing it now unless it's extremely cheap and you're curious, but during its active lifespan it was a great game.

Ви коли-небудь хотіли пограти щось в епоху чистого, я маю на увазі без магічних штук, середньовіччя? Якщо так, то ця гра саме те, що потрібно. Тут є досить великий відкритий світ, гра не заганяє в рамки, ви можете робити все що спаде на думку і бути будь-ким: розбійником, найманцем, торговцем, лордом або кинути виклик усім і стати володарем власного королівства, а згодом і королем усієї Кальрадії. З часом гра починає набридати, тоді на сцену виходять модифікації, це є ще одним великим плюсом. У вас є можливість перетворити гру на будь-що, від сонячного ""Дикого заходу"" і моторошних земель ""Володаря перснів"", до космічних просторів із всесвіту ""Зоряних війн"".

Ця гра сильно затягує, тому якщо вона вам сподобається, то з великою ймовірністю у перші дні буде награно кілька десятків годин. Серйозно, мені було важко з неї вийти, постійно в голові складав план, наприклад, ось завершу цей квест і виходжу, а в цей момент на карті з'являлися кілька лутерів і я такий ""перемагаю їх і на сьогодні досить"", але потім все затяглося на кшталт зроблю це, зроблю то, продам то, знищу тих, бах і замок в осаді... Дивлюся, а надворі вже ніч і треба лягати спати. Спочатку я взагалі думав зайти побігати трохи, зробити кілька знятків і вийти. І я набігав аж 130 годин за кілька тижнів.

Дивлячись на негативні рецензії, то 75% з них є просто через те, що існує M&B Warband, як на мене це не зовсім справедливо, але я розумію їх, він дійсно краще, як з технічного стану так і візуально, і так, я [b]РЕКОМЕНДУЮ[/b] починати з Warband, але не слід забувати, що оригінальний M&B це по суті його фундамент і обзивати його лохом через те, що у нього є менший брат, який набагато кращий у всьому, я не можу.

Українізатора для M&B на жаль немає, але в цій ситуації я не впевнений, чи він взагалі потрібен, як я писав вище, краще починати з Warband, Українізатор для якого є.

[h1]7 полонених королів з 10[/h1] | Mount & Blade – це унікальна серія, яка втілює мрію кожного гравця про свободу у відкритому середньовічному світі. Розроблена турецькою студією TaleWorlds Entertainment, гра стала справжнім подарунком для любителів стратегій, ролевих ігор та епічних битв. Незважаючи на відсутність глянцю великих ААА-проєктів, Mount & Blade захоплює своєю глибиною та неповторним шармом.

Свобода вибору
Однією з найбільших переваг Mount & Blade є повна свобода дій. Ви починаєте як невідомий мандрівник і можете стати ким завгодно: найманцем, торговцем, лордом чи навіть королем власного королівства. Гравець має змогу самостійно вирішувати, як писати свою історію в світі Калрадії – фентезійного середньовічного континенту, наповненого політичними інтригами, війнами та нескінченними можливостями.

Бойова система
Mount & Blade відома своєю реалістичною та динамічною бойовою системою. Битви відбуваються в реальному часі, і від вашої майстерності залежить результат кожного поєдинку. Можливість брати участь у масштабних битвах, керувати загоном чи навіть стати героєм, який змінить хід війни, дарує незабутні враження. Ви відчуєте всю вагу меча, точність стріл і потужність кавалерійської атаки.

Стратегічні елементи
Крім бойових аспектів, Mount & Blade пропонує широкий спектр стратегічних можливостей. Ви можете формувати власну армію, керувати ресурсами, будувати економічні ланцюжки та укладати дипломатичні угоди. Захоплення міст і замків, боротьба за політичний вплив та управління підданими додають глибини ігровому процесу.

Атмосфера та світ
Калрадія – це світ, сповнений життя, історій і конфліктів. Різні фракції, культури та політичні амбіції створюють динамічне середовище, де кожна дія гравця впливає на подальший розвиток подій. Атмосфера середньовіччя відчувається у всьому: від музичного супроводу до деталей одягу та архітектури.

Особливості серії
Mount & Blade: Warband – вершина класичної серії, яка додала мультиплеєр і розширила можливості для створення власного королівства.
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord – довгоочікуване продовження, яке зберегло дух оригіналу, але вивело графіку, механіку та масштабність гри на новий рівень.
Графіка та технічні аспекти
Хоча графіка Mount & Blade не є найсильнішою стороною серії, це з лишком компенсується глибоким геймплеєм і багатством можливостей. Своєрідна естетика додає шарму та допомагає зосередитися на головному – на грі.

Модифікації – душа Mount & Blade
Окремої уваги заслуговують моди. Спільнота фанатів створила величезну кількість модифікацій, які додають нові фракції, епохи та навіть змінюють сеттинг гри. Хочете опинитися у Середзем’ї з ""Володаря перснів"" чи перенестися у світ вікінгів? Завдяки модам це можливо.

Загальне враження
Mount & Blade – це гра, яка дає вам більше, ніж ви очікуєте. Вона не хапає зірок із неба у графіці чи постановці, але її глибина, свобода та реалістичність роблять її однією з найкращих у своєму жанрі. Це проєкт для тих, хто любить виклики, стратегії та хоче творити власну історію у світі середньовіччя.

Оцінка: 9/10
Mount & Blade – це гра для душі, яка вимагає часу, але нагороджує незабутніми враженнями. | ilk m&b.

I nearly gave up due the poor control but with changing the camera behind the character, it was playable. The game initially bombed out at the start, but changing the config as suggested by others made it work for me. 

I even said I was having fun when I got to bash up the bully - three times! Voice acting is great even though the speech was a bit slow than ideal. The initial positive impression soon turned negative however. I got frustrated with the unwieldy UI - for example, in the cauldron mission where you need to cool boiling cauldrons, you will have to open up the Inventory and click on the quest item to cool. The inventory screen would not stay open and cauldrons exploded as I tried to keep having to open up the screen and mouse-click the item. You cannot create a short-cut to the quest item,  but why not? The second issue is that enemies are damage-sponge even at the easy level - which makes the game excessively long although not necessarily hard.

Felizmente, Metro Redux consegue se diferenciar nesse sentido ao trazer ao mercado um valor de produção muito grande, ao mesmo tempo em que resgata experiências já um tanto quanto antigas. Usando a versão mais recente da 4A Engine, o pacote permite reviver as experiências de Metro 2033 e Metro Last Light com gráficos revitalizados e com uma jogabilidade mais refinada do que a vista nas versões originais.

Tivemos a oportunidade de conferir a remasterização na íntegra e, nesta análise, trazemos tudo aquilo que você precisa saber sobre ela. Além disso, aproveitamos para retornar aos lançamentos originais para conferir o quanto elas se diferenciam do novo trabalho feito pela 4A Games.


Um novo fôlego para a franquia:

A principal novidade de Metro Redux fica por conta do uso da versão mais recente da 4ª Engine, que já se mostra bem adaptada aos requisitos da nova geração de consoles. Na prática, isso se reflete em modelos tridimensionais com uma qualidade melhor, em um novo sistema de iluminação e em texturas com um nível maior de detalhes.

O maior beneficiado pelo novo motor gráfico é Metro 2033, lançado no já distante ano de 2010. Embora o game ainda possa ser considerado belo (especialmente no PC), o trabalho feito pelos desenvolvedores conseguiu trazer a ele um novo nível de qualidade — o que deve ajudar a justificar o retorno daqueles que já conferiram a versão original.

Além de adotar modelos de personagens com uma qualidade maior de detalhes, o game ganha texturas em alta resolução que permitem apreciar melhor a direção de arte da 4A Games. O título também traz monstros com um visual aprimorado e diversas adições às suas animações, o que garante uma maior naturalidade de movimentos tanto para personagens humanos quanto para as criaturas mutantes que você deve enfrentar.

Metro 2033 também ganhou algumas atualizações em suas mecânicas de jogo, adotando um sistema de controles idêntico àquele visto na sequência Last Light. Outro ponto que mostra a dedicação dos desenvolvedores a realmente fazer um trabalho de qualidade são as cenas de corte do jogo, que agora são reproduzidas exclusivamente em primeira pessoa — com direito a diversos momentos interativos.


Experiência que se sustenta:

O ponto que mais se destaca no conteúdo visto em Metro Redux é a maneira como a franquia continua parecendo “fresca”, mesmo que seu primeiro capítulo tenha sido lançado há quase meia década. Muito disso se deve à ambientação explorada pela 4A Games, que se assemelha muito mais a um game do gênero Survival Horror do que a um FPS convencional.

Talvez ciente de que nem todos os jogadores podem se interessar por um título com certas restrições, o estúdio decidiu criar dois estilos de jogabilidade: Survival e Spartan. Enquanto o primeiro reduz a quantidade de munições e armamentos que você encontra (o que torna a experiência mais assustadora), o segundo age como um “jogo de tiro convencional”, permitindo que você seja mais descuidado durante os combates.

Independente da opção que você escolher, a experiência básica de ambos os jogos se mantém impressionantemente sólida. Grande parte disso se deve à presença de adversários com uma boa inteligência artificial (que sofreu aprimoramentos notáveis na versão Redux, especialmente em Metro 2033) e também à maneira como os combates são construídos.


Vale a pena? Muito bom mesmo vale muito a pena !!!

Devemos ser bem sinceros: caso você já tenha finalizado Metro 2033 e Metro Last Light, a aquisição de Metro Redux não é exatamente necessária — afinal, por maiores que sejam as melhorias apresentadas, em essência os jogos permanecem idênticos. No entanto, quem não pôde conferir as experiências em sua época de lançamento (ou simplesmente quer revivê-las) não poderia pedir muito mais da remasterização.

Nesse sentido, surge como vantagem a possibilidade de poder adquirir as duas versões Redux de forma individual através do meio digital. Dessa maneira, você pode escolher somente o título que mais lhe interessa, deixando de lado aquele com qual já tem mais familiaridade — algo que, devemos admitir, deve prejudicar um pouco as vendas de Last Light em sua versão para PC.

Caso você simplesmente nunca tenha entrado no universo de Metro, essa é a melhor opção para conhecer o universo da franquia. Metro: Redux é a versão definitiva dos dois títulos da série e seu grande nível de qualidade deixa uma boa perspectiva do que podemos esperar para os trabalhos futuros do estúdio 4A Games.


Pros:

* Jogabilidade renovada ajuda a atualizar Metro 2033
* Nova engine contribui para tornar os títulos ainda mais bonitos
* Modos de jogo agradam tanto aos fãs do terror quanto a quem gosta de jogos de tiro mais tradicionais


Contras:

* Alguns bugs do passado permanecem incomodando | Игра хорошо набирает оборот. Слаба в геймплее но интересна на ощущениях. Типа остановиться сложно играя, но в общем формате - надоест.

One annoying technical quirk is an improper aspect ratio if playing full-screen on a modern 16:9 monitor. So your options are playing in a 800x600 window, or messing with your display settings. Other than that it ran perfectly on a modern Windows 11 system.

Seasoned adventure game players are likely to find the puzzles a touch easy. I finished the game in around 4 hours without using the hint system. Some of the puzzles were similar to those found in Monkey Island and, weirdly, Loom, so that probably helped me along. But I never found the puzzles to be unsatisfying or wholly unoriginal.

The story is a little cookie-cutter, but there are a few fun twists and turns. The main character is very likeable, honestly a rarity in comedic point'n'clicks. Good art and voice-acting.

In terms of graphics,, it's timeless. i'm amazed how well the visuals have held up over the years. I think the realism mixed with a distinct art-style is what does it. The not quite isometric camera angle and 3D assets go a long way as well.

Game-play and simulation is what really make SimCity 4 stand out though. You're not just zoning a bunch of RCI and watching all the money roll in. You actually have to be careful and manage your funds or else things will go south quickly. Yet at the same time, it's extremely rewarding to see your city succeed.

You're also provided with a plethora of ways to keep track of what's going on in your city. Not only do you have advisors and graphs; but you also can also turn on a bunch of different overlays to look for pollution, traffic, crime, etc. One of my favourite features though is the query tool. With this you can check how and where residents commute on top of other things.

With Residential and Commercial; not only can you choose 3 different density levels, but you can quite easily control the wealth too. There's also 4 different types of industrial (Farms, Dirty, Manufacturing, and High-Tech) with 2 density levels for all except farms.

I could go on and on about how great this SimCity 4 is but there's just so much. That's not to say it doesn't have flaws though. Vanilla traffic path finding is pretty bad, there are some game breaking bugs, and it just does not like modern computers very much. Fortunately most of this can be fixed with mods and some tinkering.

Basically, you love the genre you have the following options:

1. King's Bounty 
2. HOMM 3 or HOMM 3 + Horn of the Abyss
3. HOMM 5 (never played but it seems good)
4. New Song of Conquest (bought, but haven't played yet)

Age of Wonders and other 4X don't fit, so they cannot be really considered. 
Also, a viable option is Spellforce but it has RTS elements.
Or some more 'tactic' games where you have arena after arena but it's totally different stuff.

What I absolutely love about the game:
1. Old KB (HOMM) formula: mix of basic RPG elements with a turn-based strategy game
2. Fairy, fantasy, hand-crafted visual
3. Casual, silly humor and in some way deconstruction of the fantasy genre
4. Engaging combat with a huge variety of units and fun bosses
5. Absolutely gorgeous music that goes in a row for me with another Katauri masterpiece > Space Rangers!

BUT, the first time you try to take on some lizardmen, you’ll realize the combat is janky as hell. all those action points you invested in sword fighting? they don’t mean dreck because those bastards block [i]everything[/i]. every fight becomes a battle of wills: me vs. the will to keep enduring this suffering. and then, when you’ve finished all the open world stuff and only the plot missions remain, you’ll remember: the main story is the weakest part of the game. it’s just uninteresting and painfully boring. again. yep guys, this is truly a Piranha Bytes game. also, i was surprised to see in the credits that Andy Serkis, Lena Headey and Johnathan Rhys-Davies contributed voice work. why? because the acting [i]felt[/i] kind of uninspired. or maybe the writing was so generic and dull that i ended up skipping most of the dialogue and missed everything. who knows?

to wrap this up: after all i do recommend playing this game because Piranha Bytes knows how to create an engaging, tightly packed open world. but beware, it’s an old game, and it has its fair share of jank. actually, quite a lot of jank. but hey, let’s admit it, that’s part of its charm. | Игра просто разрыв очка! Давно меня с игр так не бомбило, это просто словами не описать. Система боя и враги это что-то с чем-то. Сложность игры относится только к тебе, врагам на нее похрен, так же как и на характеристики твоей брони. Вероятность блока врага - 90%, будешь метелить одного ящера до потери пульса, а стоит ему попасть по тебе - это  либо крит и шот на 300 ХП. Арбалеты в этой игре как комары носорогу, они бесполезны. Арбалетом ты будешь лупить 1 врага минут 10, это еще не самого сильного, в то время как с мечом можно хотябы на 1/5 HP снести в случае если пройдет крит, но это не точно. Бой против 2-3 врагов это танцы с бубном, тебя просто закликивают ударами со всех сторон как изменники Цезаря.  Не сохраняйтесь в этой игре во время боя, ибо игра запускается раньше чем окно загрузки и ты увидишь просто свой труп. Играл только из-за атмосферы пришедшей прямиком из Готики. В готике 1 управление было наверно лучше чем здесь и я не шучу! 1 Ящер из 10 . | Да, понравилось. Может по началу сложно вникнуть, но стоит разобраться и пошло-поехало. Игра награждает исследование и возвращение, потому что в некоторые места не так просто попасть. Рекомендую играть в версию publicbeta, потому что статистика достижений считается корректно и избегается ряд багов. И ещё: не убивать живность сразу, а по возможности избегать, чтобы в будущем после получения нужных инструментов и разделки получить больше трофеев. Достижения не очень сложные. Yes, I liked it. It may be difficult to understand at first, but it's worth figuring it out. The game rewards exploration and return because some places are not so easy to get to. I recommend playing the public beta version, because achievement statistics are considered correct and a number of bugs are avoided. And one more thing: do not kill animals immediately, but avoid them if possible, so that in the future, after receiving the necessary tools and cutting, you can get more trophies. And be saved more often. Achievements are not very difficult. | After playing the Gothic series, this game, its characters and the landscape ring a bell in the memories and warms the heart.",

(The game says I only played 0,1h but In fact I actually played over an hour offline because I had no connection, that was also the reason why I played it) 

1. Audio - It seems like that they still need to fix the audio because the conversations dont feel natural. Characters make breaks while talking where it doesnt make any sense. 

2. Bug - I guess you could say this is a bug because whenever I killed those meatbugs and looted them, the dead bodies of them were still glowing, even through buildings. When I was at the tower for the fire I still saw those dead meatbugs glow through every single wall.

3. Graphics - They look decent but there is still room for improvement but overall they are totally fine.

4. No syncro? - Im from austria so I do speak german and I do know for a fact that Gothic is famous for his german voiceover, I guess they just didnt implement it in the Playtest.

5. Fighting - Im not really a big fan how the game wants you to fight, I guess its something you have to get used to but its something new.

Im looking forward to this game because for a long time Im already searching for a medieval themed rpg that is not souls like. | wow fellers! You are did the best you could with this teaser, and lemme tell you something. Don't you ever release full version of the game, if this is the best you can do. Absolute garbage. Even fossil original game has better combat system and graphics. Absolute trash. I don't even know what did you expect. | I feel I need to clarify a few things:
- The upcoming Gothic game will be very different from this teaser.
- The combat and graphics of Gothic have been shown in videos and they are completely different from this ""test"" teaser.
- The hero will come back. Both the hero and Diego have been completely changed between 2019 and 2025. On release they'll look nothing like this teaser.
- The Teaser itself is decent, hero talks too much. The devs said they did that on purpose to get some feedback.

I recommend giving it a try just to experience something different. | unbelievable bad combat system. not working for me, but ANY foe can just kill me instantly. unskipable cutscenes and more stuff that is annoying as Freck.

если рассматривать это как Готику, то это полнейший провал, продолжение которое позорит легендарную франшизу, два плюса в данной игре которые можно отметить это - саундтреки и дизайн крепостей, вероятно именно на это весь бюджет и был потрачен, хочется стереть из памяти эту игру и осознать то, что настоящее продолжение Готики это - Хроники Миртаны: Архолос
 | Игра шла в комплекте со всеми Готиками. Планировать играть в это я не планировал, но я решил дать этой игре шанс и не зря. Что тут сказать? Однозначно продукт своего времени и даже для 2010 имеет свои проблемы, но и преимущества. В первой половине-середине игры мне казалось игру слишком перехейтили. Но чем дальше шёл сюжет во 2-ой половине игры начинается лютая душиловка, а финал не даёт тебе и половину тех ответов которая игра подразумевала дать. Игра явно сырая, незаконченная и посредственная. Здесь брали всё лучшее из других РПГ игр по типу Обливиона, Dragon Age или Ведьмака, но тут даже и RPG это назвать нельзя. Просто приключенческий экшен с элементами этой самой РПГ без заявки хоть на что-то. Тут даже вариативность просто сведена до минимума. Это не худшая игра в которую можно поиграть и провести время. В ней есть достаточно интересных квестов и сюжетных веток + фан сервис для фанатов предыдущих частей Готики. (как бы иронично и безумно это не звучало) Саундтрек приятный и заглавная тема игры неплохо сделана. Но сама по себе игра просто выглядит, как будто её вымучено выпустили хотя даже имей она хорошие РПГ элементы это бы её не спасло от фанатов Готики которые уничтожили эту игру. Хотя у этой игры есть потенциал на хорошую игру без привязки ко вселенной Готики (хотя тут не получится её как-то обособленно воспринимать учитывая, как всё тут связано со вселенной) Я не хейчу её, но она точно не заслуживает внимания если вы хотели получить полноценный продукт. Аркания таким не является. Это было не ужасно, что хотелось игру закрыть... Но и не хорошо. | One night stand game. You play it, and then you forget about it.

If it was standalone game and not Gothic, it would be better, but still, it wouldn't be any special. It would just be there, in an ocean of many better rpg games.

In ArcaniA there is nothing to do other than main quest, because all the other quests are either ""Go fetch me that item boy"" or ""Kill these beasts for me boy"". But even main quest is all about doing this things. There's nothing interesting that happens along the way. You just kill and bring items to npc's.

The world is big, that's the only good part. And the cities actually look like cities, not like in Gothic 3 which was supposed to show us the entire Myrtana continent, but've we only seen a small villages and a castle that was supposed to be a capital of Myrtana, with no real port for ships lmao. So yeah, you can say it is an improvement in ArcaniA. BUT, we have all this areas to go to and to explore, but we don't have any access to quick travel! You have to go everywhere by foot! The only things you have are teleportation circles that you can travel from one to another, but if you ever used one, you know how bad they are. There are always two, linked with each other, instead of letting us to teleport to whichever teleport we want. It's freaking awful!

The combat system is an improvement from Gothic 3. But only for melee and ranged ""classes"". Mages actually lost SO many spells...

The visuals of the game aren't breath taking, not even amazing. They're just mid. Not bad. But the optimization of the game is just as bad as in Gothic 3, nothing new. Ohh, I nearly forgot. The models of characters look AWFUL! Not only it's copy paste with nearly every npc, but the women in this game look HIDEOUS! Even one from the main mission, that has the only unique look in the entire game, and with which our Hero is in love with!

The story can be summarized as ""Just go and don't come back""
It's just stupid. Whenever it makes a bit of sense, it is shadowed by the overall stupidity. Don't have anything else to add. Oh, wait I have

Have a good day whoever reads this to the end lol | Молодость вспомнил. Поиграть можно. 
На Steam сразу запустилась. 
До этого лицензионную (коробочная версия, там куча книжек и брелок с флешкой и аудио диск) устанавливал, не идет (слишком хорош комп для нее) что то с видео. И три торент версии пробовал, тоже не идут.
По самой игре комментировать не буду. Тут об этой игре плохие отзывы. А я просто молодость вспомнил. Мне в удововольствие было поиграть. | В-общем, не всё так плохо, как я привык думать.

Ниже привожу небольшой гайд для тех, кто, как и я, прошел все готики-райзены-элексы-архолосы и прочие диккурики, и периодически поглядывал на арканию, но слишком боялся прикоснуться из-за ужасных отзывов.

От игры можно получить удовольствие, честное слово. Но первое, что нужно сделать, и твердо напоминать себе на протяжении всей игры - это фанфик по мотивам готики. Не более того.
Это спасёт вас от многих разочаровании, и не даст отвлечься от плюсов игры (а они есть).

По-хорошему, арканию должны были сделать ""дьяблоидом по мотивам готики"", как мне кажется. Если бы это изначально преподносилось так - был бы какой-никакой успех. А так, конечно, разговоры о ""готике 4"" привели к провалу.

Далее, обязательно исправляем ini файл, который позволит нам бегать на клавишу shift. В интернет есть и инструкция, и замена файла. Тратим одну минуту, экономим пять-шесть часов. Так как бегать в игре придется много, и делать это медленно не захочется совершенно.

В настройках выключаем ""режим ролевой игры"". Это отключает использование интерактивных предметов, типа работы на наковальне или помешивание супа в котелке. Вы будете на них случайно нажимать и нервничать. Это не является нашей целью. И это будет напоминать вам о готике. Что тоже не является нашей целью.

В целом, игра настраивает нас на то, что нам нужно зачилить. На время прохождения аркании (это минимум часов 10) настоятельно рекомендую днем ходить на тяжелую изнурительную работу. Вечером вам захочется расслабиться во что-то ненапряжное и красочное. И паззл сложится идеально.

В игре есть несколько квестов на подумать, но они прям лишние. Можно сразу гуглить прохождение.

Сложность можно выбирать любую. В процессе поменяете на ту, которая вам нужна. В зависимости от уровня расслабленности.

Вот и всё. С этими советами аркания даже покажется вам игрой, и сможет принести некоторое удовольствие. Правда, всего один раз.",
76561197970698176,22380,Fallout: New Vegas,80.58333333333333,"Action, RPG",23,"I desperately need a remaster of this game, the crashes and bugs make this unplayable at times. This game is definitely the best fallout but not the best game, the attention to detail of many small towns in the Mojave Desert is satisfying and the hundreds of things to do makes this very re-playable. But it is missing one thing, poker. | es horriblemente injugable todo esta mal, en el rendimiento es malo, se crasheea muy rapido y aveces no explica cosas
un 10/10 | This is in my opinion the best first person RPG ever made. Obsidian really knocked it out of the park with this one. The world of Fallout is one of my favorite to visit and this game has plenty to explore. Something to note is that much of this game is set in an open desert which I admit isn't super visually stimulating but there's plenty of unique spots to find within the desert and it makes finding towns and settlements that much more enjoyable but your mileage may vary. In terms of gameplay, this game does show its age in more ways than one, however I don't think this takes away from the game at all. Specifically the shooting in this game is a little janky and hard to get used to but personally I feel this adds to the experience because of V.A.T.S., the sort of auto aim mechanic in the game. Personally I don't have many issues aiming as I've gotten used to the game but for newcomers it can be a learning curve. In terms of the RPG aspect, this game passes with flying colors. You can customize your character a variety of ways and (especially without the DLC raising the level cap) it rewards you for doing multiple playthroughs by trying out different builds and perks. As for the story, there are multiple factions to engage with and the game gives you almost complete freedom on how you choose to deal with all of them. You can even reject them all and form your own path. The soundtrack is also phenominal from both the in-game radio and the overworld music. One minute you'll be listening to classic jazz and country tracks, the next you'll be listening to the creepy ambience as you explore a new cave or abandoned building. The voice acting also leaves little to be desired, with stellar performances all around for basically every character in the game. You will find that many characters sound quite similar, with voices like Liam O'brien and Yuri Lowenthal being used all over the game. This might detract from your immersion but personally I think they do an excellent job with all of their roles and make most of them sound unique. The main game of Fallout New Vegas is excellent in every way I could think of and delivers on everything I want from an RPG. That being said I found the DLCs to leave a little to be desired, especially Dead Money. A fair warning for new players, if you go into a DLC area (aside from the Lonesome Road) you will not be able to return to the main game until it is finished and all of these areas are very high level. The stories of these DLCs also continue and expand on much of the story of New Vegas's base game so I would advise to play them after finishing the game for the best experience. Dead money has a great story but is very flawed. If you did not level any melee abilities before going in, you will most likely have a hard time playing catch up because the guns found here are either not good or are hard to come by. It also has a mute character who uses sign language. Cool idea, horribly implemented. Honest Hearts is some more good old fashioned New Vegas to run around in and I personally found it very enjoyable and it expands well on the main story. Old World Blues is the wackiest of the bunch by far. Many new unique weapons to find and some great quality of life upgrades for your playthrough. I didn't really care for the story, the main characters will talk at you for literally almost 20 minutes straight with nothing interesting to say other than ""funny"" fart jokes to keep you entertained. Thankfully there is an option to skip all this dialogue which I have used to great use on my many playthroughs. Finally, The Lonesome Road is a great capstone for the game. Your mileage with the story in this one may vary, but the gameplay in this new area is fantastic with many new challenging enemies and awesome areas to explore. With that being said, I do not think the DLC is mandatory to play to enjoy New Vegas to it's fullest. I think the best part of the game is the main game and I often don't even go into the DLC unless I'm doing a full run. If you've been on the fence about trying this one, or even just want a good game to play, play it. It will be worth your time and money. 10/10 | The house always wins.

While the graphics didn't hold up well, that should't matter when playing a masterpiece like this.

The amount of choices and nuance is outstanding and it makes me wish Bethesda would more often let other companies have a go at IP's that they hold. 

Is it out of spite that obsidion created the best Fallout game to date that they no longer allow it? Who knows. 

But what you should know is that this is *the* fallout game to play. The courrior's style is as iconic as this game. | Um dos melhores jogos de mundo aberto de todos os tempos, mesmo anos após seu lançamento continua incrivél.",'The Fallout' soundtrack is a definite must-have for fans of the genre.

And God, how wonderful it is: strong characters, gorgeously written dialogues, an epic story, you just dissolve in all this. I had already forgotten that such games were once released and made.

You really get incredible pleasure from the dialogues compared to the fourth part. Dialogues here are like a separate art form, it is clear that the developers once worked hard. In general, this is not the only thing that can give you emotions, the game itself is very variable: this concerns both your backstory and your choice in certain actions, you are the creator of your story and what its outcome will be depends only on you.

Pros:
☑️🔝 An epic story with saving the world, where you are the chosen one and your decisions will determine what the ending will be, as well as a number of other important events. The right to choose, as in RPG games, is not an empty phrase here as in the finale of Mass Effect 3; 
☑️🔝 Well-written and interesting characters;
☑️🔝 Dialogues and the variability of their choices give exquisite pleasure;
☑️🔝 The ability to create a character and choose what your backstory will be;
☑️🔝 Interesting character leveling system. I found it very interesting to fight and level up my character;
☑️🔝 The atmosphere, music are top notch here;
☑️🔝 The ability to install mods.

And also many many other advantages, each of which is native and special for each person.

Even before the Steam version, I spent countless hours here, I spent many hours on certain events in the game, replayed this fantastic game many times. This game gave me so many pleasant and positive emotions that words are not enough to describe everything I feel about this game. I love the first part and consider this game the best from the BioWare studio. There was nothing better from them and perhaps there never will be. I would also add the first and second parts of Mass Effect as well as Jade Empire here. | 不敢玩龙腾2和审判，是因为不想看到那个有时天真、有时腹黑，聊起漂亮鞋子会蹦蹦跳跳，表达感情坦坦荡荡的Leliana就此身居幕后，成为主角团的引路人，关键是与灰卫再无瓜葛。也许世界观如此，所以灰卫无论如何不能有个好结局（作为男人当国王除外，因为我不可能选男主控就无视掉了），也无论如何不能与爱人长相厮守。那位有着火红头发的吟游诗人常常入我梦里，我无数次想要打开DA2的手都停了下来，我的DAO永远停在打完蕾莉安娜之歌的那个下午。当年我玩质量效应时也有这样的感情，但毕竟主角没换，两人都活着就能再见面，即使不再是队友。可是DA不一样，我无法停止害怕遇到性情大变的Leliana，也许我打开DA2的那天，是我终于停止爱她的那天吧。 | 虽然画面和手感落后，但剧情和游玩体验胜过现在很多大作。玩完以后意犹未尽，大概还因为最后主角希腊英雄般的一剑，波澜壮阔的一生，未尽之语，颠沛流离，从此不必再提

路过的薛姐：在说我吗？ | Dragon age: Origins, woah there's a game. If Skyrim is the guy in high-school all the girls wanted to date, but was really just average, and Fable was the nerdy awkward foreign exchange student all the juniors tried to bang, then where is dragon age? 

Dragon age is the 6' 8"" monstrosity of a man that fingered your girlfriend on prom night. No one expects Dragon age origins. DA is the guy that looms in the background dark and mysterious, but after hitting the showers fresh off an intense PE class, DA walks through to his locker butt-ass naked, with his full 10.3"" flaccid hog swinging freely.

That is to say, Dragon Age is bold. The game has mature subject matter dealing with death on massive scales, racism, class based societies, deception, grotesque body horror, and enough S.V.U. crime to keep Benson and Stabler employed for at least 3 lifetimes. Seriously, look at brood mothers and tell me DA didn't earn that mature rating. 

But dragon age is a complex character, just like Jack Reacher, Dragon age isn't just a brute. The game is extremely adept at exploring plot points in immersive and clever ways. Handles scenes that need finesse and understanding with expertise, and does a great job of both showing and telling the player about the world around them. But more than that, dialogue decisions and direct actions carry weight and will have repercussions later into the game. 

If you like well written and immersive RPG's that stick with you well past their run times then check out Dragon Age: Origins at your earliest convenience. 

 | В дни былой славы Bioware умели и могли так, что единственным эпитетом, полностью отражающим весь размах, было слово «ЭПИЧНО». Именно так, большими буквами. И эта эпичная история началась с релизом Baldur’s Gate, которая перевернула представление о компьютерных ролевых играх в своё время.

Потом были Baldur’s Gate 2, Neverwinter Nights, и с каждым релизом скилл канадской студии только рос. С выходом Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic сформировался именно тот образ «RPG от Bioware», который затем закрепился в умах игроков. Это было увлекательное приключение с масштабной историей, в которой можно было выбирать, как будут развиваться дальнейшие события, и живыми персонажами, реагирующими на действия протагониста и иногда выясняющими друг с другом отношения. А в 2007 разработчики выпустили Mass Effect, которая стала важной вехой в их подходе к геймдизайну ролевых игр — краеугольными камнями стали экшн и кинематографичность. Потом это ещё сильно отразится на их последующих играх, но к 2009 году концепция типичной ролевой игры Bioware образца SW KOTOR сохранилась.

Так вот, ЭПИЧНЫЙ Dargon Age: Origins. Духовный наследник серии Baldur’s Gate — так назвал DAO один из основателей Bioware, Рэй Музика. Игра действительно воплотила в себе все особенности BG (фэнтезийный сеттинг, фокус на сюжете и персонажах, боевая механика с тактической паузой), при этом сохранив самобытность за счёт интересного проработанного лора и атмосферы тёмного фентези. 

Главная особенность DAO — вариативность. Совершенно разные прологи при выборе определённой расы или класса — это, наверное, первое, что бросается в глаза. Игрок также решает, в каком порядке проходить сюжетные арки; от его действий зависит не только судьба ключевых персонажей, но и лояльность спутников. Делая конкретный выбор по ходу выполнения квестов или отыгрывая роль, игрок может выгнать спутника из партии или даже убить его. Спутники в Dragon Age это вообще отдельная история, говорить о них можно долго и много.

[quote]Лелиана: Я слышала, ты дочь Флемет, ведьмы из дебрей Коркари.
Морриган: А я слышала, что ты мыла ноги зимой и простудила мозги, но мы ведь все знаем, что это неправда. Но иногда слухи не врут, и в этом они правы.[/quote]

По части геймплея в плане прогрессии персонажа тоже имеется вариативность: игра за воина, разбойника и мага при определённой прокачке — это совершенно разный опыт. Если, например, играть за волшебника и выбрать специализацию Боевой маг, геймплей максимально преобразится: из дистанционного хлюпика маг превратится в танка в тяжелой броне с мечом и щитом. В системе прогрессии разных классов есть, конечно, сомнительные навыки, но тут, скорее, зависит от билда и предпочтений в стиле ведения боя.

Система лута и экипировка типичная для представителя жанра: с большим количеством оружия, брони и аксессуаров. Некоторые вещи улучшаются рунами.

Крафт довольно неплохо вписан в игровой процесс и максимально полезен на высоких уровнях сложности. Разделён на три категории: зелья, яды и ловушки. Заниматься крафтом расходников интересно — для каждой категории качается свой навык, нужны рецепты и ингредиенты. Что-то можно найти, что-то — купить. 

К слову, про купить. Экономика реализована хорошо — деньги не сыпятся как из рога изобилия, накапливаются с трудом, тратить всегда есть на что. На первых порах помогает воровство. Взлом тоже обязателен к прокачке, потому что в запертых сундуках можно найти уникальные вещи.

В общем, если вы уже играли в Baldur’s Gate или другие классические crpg, то в Dragon Age освоитесь моментально. Настоятельно рекомендую. Лично для меня DAO это прям представитель Золотого фонда cRPG, мастхэв и ""12 из 10"".

Great RPG game, which it does not fit into the Dragon Age 1 / 2 video game series so I recommend this game, like myself!

FIN:

Loistava rpg peli, sille jolle ei sovi Dragon Age 1/2 videopeli sarja niin suosittelen tätä peliä, niin kuin itsellenikin! | Great game. Has elements of Dragon Age, KotR and this old school game I never got working called Lords of Midnight.

A unique and flavourful experience with plenty of room to adapt your style of play based on how you like to grind your meat in a beautiful RPG. 

Also, not OVERLY intensive graphically. Quality is still there without turning your PC into a second furnace that can heat your entire house / apartment. Plenty of intuitive built-in options to help you customize your performance visually and avoid any chopping or ugliness

Ambience is great, depth of detail is excellent, the lack of tool tips and the amount of things to be found if you look carefully creates a great ""puzzle"" element that rewards the attentive without punishing the impatient.

The overly critical may say that it borrows from some other game that they are sentimental to, but Div II definitely has a flavour all it's own.

At $20, an absolute steal of a game. Couldn't put it down once I got into it. | This game is about being a giant dick to everyone, all the time. Seriously I decided beforehand i was going to play this game as a white knight and I was still a total dick. Strangely enough the arch-nemesis is a really cool guy, I wish we could have hung out more.

Впечатления остались приятные: это отличная игра своего времени, хотя и не без недостатков. Обидно, что из-за давления издателя проект не достиг того уровня законченности, которого, вероятно, хотела сама студия. Тем не менее, получилось довольно неплохо.

[b]Плюсы: [/b]
Квесты — сценаристы проделали отличную работу. Диалоги, задания и основной сюжет вызывают уважение.
Музыка — на высоком уровне, за 80 часов не надоела.
Сюжет — развивается интересно, особенно ближе к финалу.
Красивый мир — левел-дизайн заслуживает похвалы.
[b]Минусы:[/b]
Малое количество ассетов: модели призраков, гоблинов и NPC начинают надоедать из-за однообразия.
Неживой мир: NPC статичны, не двигаются, что портит атмосферу.
Скучная середина игры: определённые моменты сильно затянуты.
Однокнопочная боевая система: превращает битвы в рутину, особенно в конце.
Геймплей и прокачка:
На первый взгляд система прокачки выглядит увлекательно, предлагая возможность создавать необычные билды. Однако она ломается о примитивность боевой системы, где часто выгоднее качать одно направление, чтобы не проседать по урону. Многие способности либо противоречат друг другу, либо не могут быть использованы одновременно.

[b]Визуальная часть:[/b]
Игра выглядит хорошо, особенно для своего времени. Однако есть спорные решения в дизайне: однотипные модели призраков, гоблинов и NPC начинают утомлять. Если бы модели менялись или добавлялись уникальные детали, впечатление было бы гораздо лучше.

[b]Мир игры:[/b]
Открытый мир красивый и сделан с выдумкой, но абсолютно статичен. NPC просто стоят на местах, не взаимодействуя ни с окружением, ни друг с другом, что создаёт ощущение ""декораций"", а не живого мира.

[b]Структура игры:[/b]
Игра поделена на три части:

Основная игра: Первая треть игры служит вводной. Сначала кажется скучной, но постепенно сюжет набирает обороты, и играть становится интереснее.
Первое DLC: Средняя часть игры — самая неудачная. Однообразие, уныние и фарм портят впечатление.
Финальное DLC: Заключительная часть получилась камерной и самой интересной. Небольшие оригинальные квесты, элементы метроидвании и остроумные сюжеты делают её лучшей частью игры.",

I'm cringe laughing through the intro. My guy looks like he is out on a jog. The combat has a back-hand slap in it. There is a lot of clumzy looking animations that make no sense and look entirely silly. The main character has a raspy batman voice. Acting is very rarely good.

This game is like a nicotine strip for your gambling addiction — it gives you just the right amount of fix without needing to pawn your phone or drop 150€ on some online poker site in Malta. If you’re tired of pretending you're not addicted to poker, this is the perfect way to scratch that itch while still being able to pay rent.

You’re sitting there, in an underground lair (or wherever this place is), playing poker.
Each character brings their own vibe, personality, and distinct set of cards (okay, not really, but you get it).

The real kicker is that this game exposes just how trash your poker skills are. You might think you're the king of Texas Hold'em, but once you see how those other guys bluff, you’ll be questioning every poker move you’ve made in your life. The AI is tough but fair, COLD AS ICE IF YOU ARE NOT ALERT

And here’s the beauty of it — unlike your friends who probably only show up when it’s their turn to actually deal with your addictions, these digital companions will play with you, let you lose to them, and still crack jokes about it, making you feel like you’re not just a lone sad piece of shit wasting away in your room. In fact, they might even make you want to play again, as you desperately try to reclaim some imaginary honor.

If you’ve got a gambling problem, this is probably the closest you'll get to redemption without having to go to any actual meetings. 

All said and done, Poker Night at the Inventory is the perfect game to kill time while realizing that you’re nowhere near as good at poker as you thought.

76561197970698176,26800,Braid,0.4,"Casual, Indie, Strategy",1,"Braid é um excelente jogo pra quem busca jogo puzzle-platform que seja bem feitinho, porque de fato, o jogo é bem feitinho.

O jogo tem altos aspectos positivos como por exemplo a arte visual, é simples e bem bonitinho, as músicas também são muito boazinhas de ouvir (mesmo depois de um bom tempo) e também, não é apenas puzzle, tem também uma historinha.
O jogo tem uma pegada muito igual a de Super Mario, desde alguns inimigos ou até mesmo o fato de você estar atrás de uma princesa e sempre quando você chega no castelo, ela não está lá.

A principal diferença de Braid nisso tudo é que você pode voltar no tempo. E isso abriu portas pra diversas mecânicas, seja apenas voltar no tempo pra impedir alguma morte, manipular determinados itens ou inimigos que não são afetados pelo tempo diferente de outros, criar clones de si mesmo que recriam todos os passos que você fez ou até mesmo criar campos de força que quanto mais próximo deles, mais devagar o tempo passa. Sério, todas essas mecânicas são muito legais na hora dos puzzles. 

Só que o jogo tem muitos pontos negativos também.

Alguns puzzles são MUITO dificeis, no nível de você se estressar MUITO. O jogo não deixa de nenhuma forma explícito como você deve resolver alguns puzzles, e muitos deles tem uma forma única de resolver e as vezes tão específica mas tão específica que chega a ser ridículo como um ser humano conseguiria pensar em resolver daquela forma. 
A história também é muito fraca e confusa, não faz o menor sentido e é uma leitura muito difícil. Outra coisa é que em vez de contarem aos poucos ao passar de cada fase, o jogo te apresenta um sistema de mundos aonde cada mundo tem um ""lobby"" e lá você pode ler toda a história de uma vez sem animação nenhuma. 
E também, a história não tem nada a ver com os puzzles ou as fases que você está jogando, é como se fossem duas coisas completamente diferentes, história e jogo.

No quesito história dos jogos, por ser um dos primeiros jogos indies mais relevantes ou no quesito puzzle-platform, que é definitivamente um dos mais diferentes que tem, é um jogo muito bom.

76561197970698176,29180,Osmos,0.5666666666666667,"Casual, Indie",1,"Osmos is a game that admittedly is somewhat special to me, in light that it was one of the items acquired for the still-deemed-to-be-almost-completely-insignificant 8th Grade Graduation event in 2010, yet also a completely baffling, confounding, fundamentally broken experience.

I haven't the foggiest of clues how literally [b]anyone[/b] could try to play through 2 of the three level branches in-game, and not only deem it a [b]finished product[/b] that's ready to send to market, but also charge $10 for it. Similarly, I very much want to know which game everybody that pushed its Metacritic Score up to [b]EIGHTY[/b] was playing, and/or how much of it was done so before passing judgement.

To delve into what's wrong with this slow, plodding, almost-entirely-unengaging disaster, I first need to have you, dear reader, imagine you're playing literally any game with a level (style of game doesn't matter), and end goal for said stage. 

Now imagine that instead of making sure you have even the [b]chance[/b] of [b]starting to play[/b] this level, you instead need to repeatedly pause and generate a new map to make sure the game bothers giving you collision to stand on, then literally anything else that's needed to clear said stage.

I would say “This is at least two levels in Osmos”, however, this analogy is not over, because even if the game you're imagining gives you a starting piece of terrain, allows you to move within it, and grants you the equipment needed to have a chance at beating the stage, no guarantee exists the end goal was generated alongside it, 

This is to say that after spending sometimes up to 10 minutes trying to beat this stage, you can be at the second to last action needed to fulfil the objective, only to find the switch you needed to push, unit you needed to spawn, and/or edge of the platform you need to jump from to get to the goal is completely missing.

Guess what this means you need to do? Keep generating a new map until the basics are granted, then hope the game gave you a complete level that can finished this time around.

[b][u]This is to say that levels in Osmos are not designed, they're generated, and not only that, seemingly nothing by any flags, checks, or programs are in-place to make sure said stage can be completed was bothered to be programmed[/u][/b], making the gameplay loop “play until you get stuck on a level, regenerate said level until you can even start to play it, and hope that the system blessed you with the apparently unheard-of privilege of being able to beat said stage.

I have gone back to this game at least twice since acquiring it almost 15 years ago, and each time, I reached a “level” that's not only entirely reliant on RNG to be able to not only do anything at-all in, but seemingly completely unable to be finished.

The first revisit saw one of the “Force” clusters be perpetually beyond even beginning, and while the A3B cluster seemed doable at first, after – no joke – at least 30 restarts, 1 hour and a half wasted, and only 15 that I wasn't completely blocked out of doing anything with, none of those were finished.

It gets worse, though, because in order to have a chance at defeating any enemy (in this case stationary blobs for most of the levels I bothered even trying to play) you – so to speak – need to take health from yourself, and give it to whichever adversary you may be facing. This already sounds completely unreasonable, but once you assimilate the “Health” of the other enemy, you grow to their size, unable to get through corridors, and use weaker ones to hope to try and beat the bigger ones, while hoping beyond hope nothing happens to give imperative health to your adversary, causing it to grow bigger, and completely block you off from progressing.

[b][u]The fundamental laws of game design state:[/u][/b]

1: If you must have a randomiser take the place of intentional design, include checks, and flags, then redundancy on redundancy to make sure every level can be completed via player agency, and skill, rather than the randomiser putting everything in.

2: Once these are in-place, make absolutely sure that everything it makes can be consistently completed, playing each level multiple times, and perhaps have multiple people also do so, to increase the amount of tested instances/generations.

3: Once everything is confirmed to be working [b][u]then[/u][/b] publish it.

As such, we reach the

[b][u]Verdict:[/u][/b] A seemingly-untested, unfinished-feeling frustration-fest that relies entirely on luck to allow the player to do anything, with two levels either taking hours of restarts to beat, or otherwise are completely impossible to finish.

[b][u]Placed In:[/u][/b] Were this acquired on any other occasion, I would have 0 qualms whatsoever about ousting it from my account such that I never have the temptation to be disappointed by it in the future again, but as it stands, it's shakily at 6: Traumatically Toxic, and “Remove it anyway.” | Klassiker","Despite its uniqueness, Osmos is a sluggish, plodding, and utterly unconvincing experience."

Everything about this game is amateurish. It plays like a mediocre fan-made game, whose dev team never really understood what made F.E.A.R. good in the first place. It feels like they took any element they could from other games in the genre, to throw away the most generic and uninspired shooter you could defecate in 2011. 

This game has nothing interesting to offer in the franchise. Everything is a downgrade from the previous F.E.A.R. games. The overall gameplay and the level design are boring, the cutscenes are out of place and the plot is abyssal. There is no atmosphere, no soul, no smart horror moments in this game. It's an insult. | Is this a Call Of Duty game or what? Like seriously, wtf even is this?

[b]Still[/b] worth playing... | I recommend using some kind of image sharpening for this game, you should be golden after that.

Don't really care what other F.E.A.R. fans say about this game. I've played through all of them now. What you have here is not a Monolith developed game, what you have is a Monolith infected game, yes somehow their DNA still made it in despite it not being made by them, couple that with John Carpenters artistic consultation and what you end up with is a masterpiece in its own right. The combat is outrageously tight and responsive, some of the finest you will ever experience. I really enjoy Paxtons grinning comments and interjections while playing through as The Point Man, it sounds raw gritty and feigns with great delight Monoliths classic tongue in cheek sense of humor and smarm. 

The cutscenes really tie in this game, giving it coherence and continuity. If you allow it in, it is a really immersive high speed freight train screaming to a smoldering hell. I love how the creative direction of this game just flat out didn't give a damn how sick it came off to the player base or viewership. It's unapologetic concerning that, which I find refreshing in today's gambit of garbage, gravy train riding, money grabbing, people pleasing, drop down to knees, and vacuum off some politically polite snowflake that demands you be a proper gentleman.

So what do I ultimately think about F.E.A.R 3? I think you catch the drift of my sentiments already. 

Being able to go back and play as Paxton is just the icing on the cake. The game's cover system is optional, I found myself only partially using it, ultimately it's there if you want to use it but is easily fully omitted. The sound design and music are top notch, although being  slightly glitchy on rare occasion.

While the single-player campaign is notably short—around three hours—it packs an incredible amount of cinematic storytelling and atmospheric world-building into its brief runtime, with each level feeling like a meticulously crafted painting that captures the brutal reality of occupation.

The gameplay, though familiar, provides solid shooting mechanics and an interesting variety of weapons that become progressively more interesting as players advance through the campaign. Multiplayer stands out as particularly enjoyable, with a team-based scoring system that emphasizes collective performance over individual kill counts, creating a more collaborative and strategic online experience. The game's maps are well-designed, conveying a compelling sense of a crumbling, occupied America that feels both authentic and emotionally charged.

Despite some technical limitations and graphical shortcomings, Homefront manages to create a uniquely immersive shooter experience that goes beyond traditional military game narratives. Its willingness to explore darker themes of war and occupation, combined with its innovative storytelling approach, makes it a memorable—if flawed—entry in the first-person shooter genre. | Great game, kinda short but the story is good and the missions are great, even giving you different things to do every now and then.

This kind of creative puzzle-solving is what I had imagined a STEM PhD program would be like (though it turns out PhDs are not really mostly about this; but that's a whole other story).

And... after a decade and a half, HOLY COW I finally beat it! Without hints**! I know many others have beat it before me, but it's still satisfying to know I've done something SpaceChem's designer Zach Barth has (according to old interviews) never done himself.

WOW has this ever been a long journey. These little molecules and waldos have accompanied me like a white whale through so many life stages. When SpaceChem came out in 2011, I started playing the game and enjoyed it a ton, but I got stuck and took a break. A few years later, I picked it up again as a distraction from grad school, but only reached the 4th or 5th world out of 9 -- before taking another (loooong) break. A decade later, after getting tenure, my treat to myself was to tackle SpaceChem seriously again... and now it's finally done -- with my kids staying up late to cheer as we beat the final boss.

Looking at the Steam-friends leaderboards, I'm also amused to see where my friends apparently quit playing. The quantum-physics PhD tunneled out in the 3rd world; the Twitch data scientist stopped streaming in the 5th; the software engineer and the IT manager suffered packet loss in the 6th. Somehow, I alone persevered to traverse the desolate worlds 7 through 9. Steam says I've spent 60ish hours on the game; I'd guess around 30 hours covered the first 6 worlds and the other 30 hours covered the last 3 worlds. Many of my solutions aren't optimized and beautiful (especially Don't Fear The Reaper; holy crap I made an ugly mess there) -- but they are mine, my own inventions, my hard-fought victories.

Once again, thank you to Zach and Zachtronics.

* The minor exceptions to fairness: (1) Every non-boss level tells you exactly how many molecules you need to make, but the boss-levels don't. It can be orders of magnitude harder to devise a solution that'll use up all molecules equally and produce an unending stream of hits, vs a good-enough solution that's unbalanced but just enough to beat the boss... yet you don't know how many hits each boss will take until you beat it. Most take around 3 hits -- but not all. (2) The game doesn't seem to allow multiple save slots for a level. If I try one solution and it doesn't QUITE work and I want to try another one, I have to get rid of my first solution and start the second... and if the second fails, I can't revert back to the first. I could take a screenshot of an initial solution, then remake it from scratch later if I need to, but aaargh! This is a small but extremely frustrating flaw in the game's interaction design. HOWEVER, I didn't realize until after beating the game that there's a dev-authorized ""community edition"" beta version which DOES allow multiple save slots per level. Look it up. Argh.

** ""I beat it, without hints"": Ok, technically, for the very last 2 boss levels I eventually looked up how many hits it takes to defeat each boss. See above -- I think this is unfair imperfect information. Besides, all the earlier bosses die after around 3 hits, but these two didn't die after 3... nor after 4... so I gave in and looked it up, because there's a big difference between ""incrementally tweak my initial solution to stretch from 3 hits to 5 or 6 hits"" vs ""start again from scratch to allow for 10 or 20 or 40 hits."" But I didn't look at anyone else's solutions, merely the number of hits required. | I'm wondering why I'm playing this game, is it any different than going to github and submitting a feature? | This is a game made for people with massive brains. | bu oyun","I'm a fan of SpaceChem, and I'm a fan of the soundtrack."

Unless you see somewhere that they have completed the migration from Games for Windows Live (GFWL) do NOT get it. Due to GFWL not functioning for D3 currently, starting a new game (or if like me you migrated computers and needed a fresh install) means you can't save any progress - not even in the single player mode. :(

That said... I loved DiRT 2, and was very excited about getting DiRT 3. While D3 has its own charms, it's not quite as engrossing as I found D2, though it is extremely pretty and sounds great. If you were head over heels for D2, you'll at least have a close platonic relationship with D3.

TL;DR:  Good game, but not right now.

Edit: I did get D3 to save profiles after uninstalled GFWL, downloading a new client and manually re-installing it, as even using a local GFWL profile refused to work. I still don't recommend the game until Codemasters decides to bother properly updating it.

Here's what made it impossible:

1. Integration with Windows Live
It's impossible to save your progress unless you have an account

2. Mirriad of online this and online that

While you are doing that, the game talks to you using words like ""awesome"", ""totally"", ""cool"" and ""I have a great feeling about this"". None of this can be skipped, you HAVE to listen to it.

3. Boring

76561197970698176,620,Portal 2,5.4,"Action, Adventure",5,"Portal 2 is one of the best puzzle games ever created. It combines logical thinking, physics-based mechanics, and an engaging story. The game takes place in Aperture Science, a mysterious and dangerous laboratory filled with test chambers. The player controls Chell, a silent protagonist who must escape using the Portal Gun. This device allows players to create two linked portals on surfaces, making it possible to teleport and solve puzzles.

One of the most impressive aspects of Portal 2 is its level design. Each test chamber introduces new mechanics, forcing players to think creatively. The game starts with simple puzzles but gradually becomes more complex. Elements like light bridges, propulsion gel, and lasers add depth to the challenges. The difficulty curve is perfect, making the game enjoyable for both beginners and experienced players.

Portal 2 also stands out with its story and humor. The main antagonist, GLaDOS, is a sarcastic and witty AI who constantly insults and manipulates the player. Wheatley, a clumsy and funny robot, adds another layer of comedy. Their dialogues make the game more entertaining and memorable. Despite its humor, the story also explores themes of control, identity, and artificial intelligence.

Another great feature of Portal 2 is its cooperative mode. Unlike the single-player campaign, co-op requires teamwork and communication. Players control two robots, Atlas and P-Body, solving puzzles that require coordination. This mode enhances the experience, making it even more enjoyable when played with a friend.

Overall, Portal

Portal 2 is a competent dexterity and logic puzzle platformer, undisputed best one out there.

The story is better, the lore deeper, the mechanics more expanded and level design is intelligent.
The multiplayer and custom content are the cherry on top, just as delicious!

La aventura se desarrolla en un gran barco llamado"" Reina del Mundo"", pero es invadido por un grupo de terroristas llamados"" Neo maltusianos"" liderados por Mila. Estos quieren reducir la población matando personas sistemáticamente y robar tecnología para convertirlas en armas.
La ingeniera de sistema Kate Wilson se ve inmersa en la batalla por la supervivencia, pero finalmente decide descubrir el complot terrorista y salvar a los pasajeros de la nave mientras este se va hundiendo.

Mientras el océano se precipita alrededor, Kate deberá lidiar con el flujo masivo de agua que nos dificultarán o impedirán directamente el avance. Kate hara uso de buenas habilidades acrobáticas para escalar por superficies elevadas y acceder a zonas fuera de las indundaciones, resolver fáciles acertijos y utilizar un dispositivo portátil para hackear códigos para abrir puertas o acceder a camaras de seguridad, además hará uso de una mediocre arma de fuego con diferentes tipos de munición y al final con un poder para provocar grandes olas que desestabilicen a los enemigos

Veamos ""hidrofobia"" entendí por el título que la protagonista presenta un miedo irracional al agua, bien, esto se manifiesta en el juego cuando Kate está sumergida en el agua con la inquietante voz de ella cuando era una niña, estos sonidos se presentan solo en los momentos tensos, pero nada más, luego en el resto de la aventura parece estar muy cómoda atravesando las inundaciones...

El juego es divertido de jugar, cuenta con 42 desafíos y 72 coleccionables, además de 13 logros Steam para desbloquear.
Dejando de lado la ingeniosa física del agua, te recordará un poco a juegos como Tomb Raider, pero con tiroteos pobres, un poco lineal, muy corto de duración y malas secciones de acertijos, además posee un modo desafío que consiste en resistir durante 5 rondas contra grupos de terroristas.
Recomiendo agarrarlo en alguna oferta de Steam | If you can find this on a deep sale, the gameplay is clunky but fun. I really enjoyed how much of a factor water physics played in this game. | An interesting game.
Built, and hyped, purely on its water physics engine Hydrophobia is an action adventure a la Tomb Raider or Uncharted although on a much smaller scale.
This is and always will be, the first episode of a planned trilogy.
Which is why the game ends abruptly on a cliffhanger.

The graphics are actually pretty decent for such an old game and definitely portrays the almost hard sci-fi I feel they were going for quite well. The environments have that clean sci-fi look that production designers like to think the future will be like.
The 'star' of the game is obviously the water, which again for the time is very impressive.
Actually, although many games since have included some type of water physics I don't know if any of them improved on this particular type. A lot of games have neat effects like the Spintires series and such, but Hydrophobia has water flowing from rooms with more water in them to rooms with less through doors and windows which I think is very different from the smaller scale water physics whereby it only interacts with objects. 
It reminds me a bit of the physics in pixel games like Clonk and Noita.
The water is fairly gelatinous though.

Sorry I went on a bit of a tangent there.
The audio is good enough.
Guns sound a bit weak and there isn't a lot of music, but it's all serviceable.
The voice acting except for the protagonist is also acceptable IMO.

The core gameplay is not bad, but the jank of the controls makes it a bit annoying at times.
Sometimes your character won't jump, or grab onto a ledge and the 'super power' system is terrible.
Which is a minor issue since you only get your power in the last five minutes of the game, but it does make the boss fight more frustrating than it needed to be.
The basic gameplay loop consists of running/swimming/climbing around until you get to a locked door, find the two parts of the key and go to the next section to repeat everything. With the occasional simple cover shooter combat inbetween.

Would I recommend it?
It's often on sale for less than 50 cents and for that price, it's certainly an interesting forgotten game.
And well, I still wouldn't recommend it really but it'll keep you busy and mildly entertained for a few hours.
If Steam had an actual rating system I'd say it's a 6.5/10 or 3/5.","This is a fun game of ficcion about a boat that is hailed with a decent technique for a water motor: the great protagonista is water. The adventure is develop in a big barco called""Reine del Mundo"", but it is invaded by a group of terrorists called ""Neo Maltusianos"" led by Mila. These want to reduce the population mating people and steal technology to convert them into weapons. The system engineer Kate Wilson sees in the battle for survival, but ultimately decides to uncover the terrorist plot and save the passengers from the ship while this is going down. Kate will use good acrobatic skills to climb over steep surfaces and access areas outside the inundations, resolve easy issues and use a portable device to hack code to open doors or access security cameras, Kate will also use a mediocre fire arm with different types of ammunition and ultimately with power to cause big olas that destabilize enemies."

差不多7年前，我的小学同学就发现了这款大作，那时手机版还没有心动，只有应用商店里的1.2版本，对于当时的我们，手机版1.2只有两个滑轮键控制移动和瞄准，并且局域网联机方便，十分益于上手。我和几个哥们一放假就聚在一起play。当时我们卡在世纪之花这个boss，就聚在学校小花园商量战术，没想到我自己直接单挑过了，还有我第一次打过肉山，是拿蜜蜂手雷和它同归于尽，真的很怀念1.2陪伴我的时光，之后1.2下架，国服代理，为了玩上1.3的泰拉，我在好游快爆苦苦地种玉米（当时可以以此换取游玩资格，否则就要花钱），没想到最后发现还需要早起抢购资格，而我当时可能在上学，没有抢到，努力直接白费。我和同学只能在网上寻找那些还没下架1.2的网站继续玩。
从小学到了初中，以前玩泰拉的朋友各奔东西，但我对泰拉的热情依然不减，后来出了手游国际版我便立即下载，顶着看不懂的英文，摸索1.3的机制，专家模式掉落的装备我都从未见过，新鲜感和好奇心油然而生，初中期间我也找到了一两个一起玩的，使我不至于太孤独。疫情之前，我从来都是只玩手机版泰拉，知道疫情上网课，我终于有机会玩上电脑版了。当时的我对电脑并不精通，也不知道steam是什么东西，于是就在360浏览器直接搜泰拉瑞亚，经过一天的寻找，我也是下到了盗版泰拉（当时我也不知道正版要买）就这么在电脑上再通关了一遍普通模式，但这次没有任何人陪伴，只有我一个人。
终于到了高中，我了解了正规的steam渠道，在打折期间花18块钱买了正版泰拉，为童年补了票，高二认识了几个志同道合的同学，一起玩了灾厄，也是乐在其中。如今，我即将成人，步入大学生活，但我的泰拉之旅还在继续，玩了十几年游戏，只有泰拉瑞亚给我的印象最深，给我带来的乐趣最多，对于陪伴了我78年的老伙计，打多少星已经不重要了，真没想到我能写这么多，回顾了一遍我的童年，我的眼里有些模糊。 | --{ Gráficos }---

[h3] Гра в цілому не є надто складною навіть на високих рівнях складності, але захоплює настільки, що день проходить за грою як година, деякі завдання можуть добряче випробувати ваші стратегічні навички, особливо якщо грати у режим з ботами на карті з початку зародження залізничного транспорту і до 80-х років (на жаль пограти з живими людьми, мені так і не вдалося). Гра виглядає саме як дитяча залізнична дорога,  не скочується у грубий «менеджмент»,  має казуальні елементи, сценарій підкидує різні «бідосі» по проходженню сценаріїв. Sid Meier's Railroads достойна, щоб у неї грати, а особливо насолоджуватись будівництвом своєї дитячої мрії. Все зайве, що заважає насолоджуватись прибрано, спрощено.

[h2] [b] Пам'ятаєте закордонні фільми, у яких люди будували іграшкову залізничну дорогу на всю кімнату. Залізниця виглядала неймовірно, а у маленького «Мене» була мрія мати хоча б невеличку колію з двома паралельними шляхами та одним потягом й різними вагончиками. Зазвичай у ТБ, залізниці були монструозними, враховували декілька вокзалів, віадук, можливість запускати два паровозики одночасно і слідкувати за менеджментом, щоб не було іграшкової катастрофи, де були залучений ручні стрілки для переводу потяга на паралельний шлях, світлова візуалізація у вигляді семафорів та панелі управління. Вагони завантажувались іграшками й мандрували по величезній дитячій кімнаті. Звісно у дитинстві, аналогічного подарунку батьки не потягнули б, а час йшов, я вже студентом багато часу проводив на залізниці їдучи на навчання, а ще мати працювала на в інформаційно-обчислювальному центрі, тому за життя я постійно був поряд біля колій, паротяг, теплотяг, Вузлів комплектування вантажних поїздів, стукоту коліс, постійних ремонтів колій і мріяв вступити до залізничного коледжу, але не добрав балів на конкурсі та після пропозиції навчатись на платній основі, пішов у РадіоПриладоБудівний коледж на бюджет. Але мрія доторкнутись до залізниці залишилась і я знайшов цю гру випадково у друзів в збірнику «Топ стратегій бла бла бла Сід Меєр». І я спробував, так залип, що не вимикав тиждень комп'ютер тримаючи гру на паузі та продовжуючи грати у кожну свобідну хвилину, це був рік 2008, я робив величезні залізничні шляхи, вдосконалював свою  імперію і поглинав конкурентів.

Питання з мостами, тунелями чи складними розв’язками вже оптимізоване грою. Розвиток міст залежить від багатьох економічних чинників і має різну швидкість, що додає реалістичності, але не перевантажує гравця складними механіками.

The main shortcoming is the extreme minimalism.  The game could do with a bit of polish in its UI and graphics.  Simple doesn't have to mean sloppy. Nevertheless, one of my favorites in the genre since the first Hexxagon. | This Game is a must-have! Dont get disturbed by the graphics, it is very very fun and you really have to use your brain if you wanna be good at this. | This game is pretty weird. It's also a lot of fun. It's fast paced.

The community of this game is unlike any other I've ever encountered in an online group. They are vindictive, rude and destructive to the game. Throughout the entire time I played I suffered no end of trolling, mocking and the like. There were people that literally exploited the kicking function to get me off of servers so I could not play the game I paid for. 
The issue also lies with the developers whom constantly ignored community begging to get hackers out. Even to this day, after an anti-cheat patch, the game is STILL cracked, people running around with weapons they shouldn't, running fast, swinging faster than is possible. Some people even exploit the bad latency issues to win. 

There's a top 1% in this game, they are not skilled players by any stretch. Instead of skill they got together and figured out what the best ways to exploit the games mechanics. From unblockable hits to builds that were simply insanely unfair, they scared away any new players to the game by trying their best to ruin the fun for others. To this day, even now, I get on and someone is taking my Steam ID name so they can spam vote kicks so I can't play. 

Stay far, far away from this game. Think of World of Warcraft only cultivated with the worst of the worst (community) possible. The truth is I enjoyed this game but the playerbase was hellbent on seeing it go under. You have honest, fun people who are endlessly frustrated by the trolls, hackers and exploiters. 

There is no welcome mat here, just a gigantic letdown. | Покупка была многообещающей, и в начале я был доволен. Но потом розы становились все хуже и хуже. Это надо было очень хорошо постараться так испортить игру. Розы спасает только то хорошее, что осталось, да и известность издателя Paradox Interactive.
[b][h1]Какие же достоинства есть у роз?[/h1][/b]
[list]
[*] Приятная графика
[*] Настройка оружия, разные виды оружия
[*] Возможность создать своих уникальных персонажей (при покупке полной версии, естественно)
[*] Неплохая боевая система, прямо как в Mount&Blade
[*] Наличие дуэльных серверов, где запрещены лучники, толпой на одного лезть нельзя и можно потренироваться.
[/list]
[b][h1]Теперь к недостаткам:[/h1][/b]
[list]
[*] Система ударов и блоков реализована, ИМХО, криво, хотя задумка [b]правильная[/b]. В Mount&Blade похожая система, но там если хочешь ударить [b]сверху[/b], то и ударяешь [b]сверху[/b], а тут так бывает далеко не всегда.
[*] Куча игроков-спамеров, которые размахивают без конца [b]двуручным[/b] оружием, [b]вообще не делая блоки[/b], а ты просто не успеваешь заблокировать атаки, ибо некоторые двуручники, видимо, ничего не весят, и спамить ими можно на ура, даже при промахах
[*] Ограничения на количество лучников в команде не было и нет, очень весело становится, когда ими все кишит - бегаешь и умираешь чуть что. А еще учитывая возрождение возле лидера - пять лучников могут собраться в один отряд и стрелять, сколько душе угодно, возрождаясь сразу же на удобных позициях. Я то и не против самих лучников, но нужно или увеличить время респавна для них, если их много, или запретить возрождаться возле лидера. Повторюсь, ЕСЛИ ИХ МНОГО. Несколько лучников придает бою адреналина, а куча - напрочь убивает удовольствие.
[*] Раздражают ролики с собственной казнью от первого лица. Пусть будет выбор - отображать ролики с казнью или просто надпись внизу ""вас прикончили"". Почему мне навязывают жестокость, не давая выбора? 
[*] Серверов мало, игроков мало, нужно подбирать время, чтобы были заполненные и с хорошим пингом
[*] На ДУЭЛЬНЫХ серверах почему-то [b]разрешены казни[/b]. Что за чертовщина? Этикет таких серверов подразумевает запрет на казни в принципе, разработчики же не пожелали сделать кпопочку в настройках сервера ""запретить казни"", они оставили все на контроль админам серверов, которые как бы должны наказывать нарушителей и которые на сервере не столь часто, к тому же бывает, что на ДУЭЛЬНОМ сервере админ ни черта не банит, как будто так и надо. Я молчу про кучу лучников и наезд толпой,  вообще-то запрещенных на таких серверах, на которые тоже некоторым админам пофигу.
[*] Где баланс  команд по уровню прокачанности? Не завезли.
[*] Лаги, лаги, лаги. С 2012 года разрабы все никак не могут оптимизировать движок и до сих пор те, у кого компьютеры тянут всякие крайзисы с батлфилдами на максимальных, и интернет хороший, недоумевают, какого черта так лагает
[*] Разрабам положить на игру. Ну вот серьезно, гляньте на список исправлений,  даже античит выкатывался достаточно долго.
[*] Доспехи порезаны не напильником, а болгаркой, теперь тяжелые носить смысла нет, ибо теряешь в скорости, а взамен - только защита от бокового удара мечом и кинжала.

Хорошо, что купил по скидке, было бы намного обиднее заплатить треть стоимости  ААА-проектов, где разработчики заняты улучшением продукта, а не непонятно чем. Я очень много играл в Mount&Blade и хотел бы, чтобы розы взяли оттуда лучшее.
[u]Игра очень нуждается в доработке[/u], хотя на что я надеюсь... Акулы пойдут и наштампуют еще 10 проектов, зачем улучшать старое, выкатят раз в полгода патч, который ничего не изменит, да и все.
Чувствую, сейчас фанаты, в упор не видящие недостатков в игре, опустят обзор по максимуму. Ну дело ваше, только вот, к сожалению, недостатки в розах не исправятся от того, что вы утопите обзор.
В обзоре присутствуют удачно подмеченные моменты от Malakhur, Shoers, *T!gRa, Doomer и других. | At its peak, this was one of my favorite games of all time, the combat mechanics were deep and had a steep learning curve, the armor system was very complex and logical, and above all this game rewarded the skill of the players. 

Of the 140 hours I've played, roughly 100 of them were spent on dueling servers fighting 1on1 with other players, all of whom were there because they enjoyed the actual competition or to master their skills with a new weapon. The dueling community was strong and friendly, always willing to help teach new players how to survive the game. 

But then the Devs changed things, the armor system simplified, the weapons became more powerful, crossbows became sniper rifles, hitboxes and crit chances grew, and the art of dueling was lost to the ether; replaced by polearm decapitations, across the map crossbow headshots, and stab spamming. All that is left now is the empty rotting shell of a once great game. | This game has an absolutely TERRIBLE community. It's absolutely toxic and leaves to room for enjoyment. This game is fun, but there is nothing but people you never want to meet in person. 

It's disgusting. Sadly, it ruins the game entirely. Duel servers are the worst hands down, filled with people who are both hypocritical, and completely immature.

I'd skip this one for the community alone. | Als das Spiel noch einen normalen Preis hatte war es sehr gut.
Die Grafik überzeugt und das Gameplay fand ich zu der Zeit noch ansprechender als das von seinem Marktbegleiter (Chivalry Medival Warfare).
Gerade weil man den Charakter weitergehend modifizieren konnte und man direkt auf Waffen sparen konnte.
Die Kämpfe haben Spaß gemacht und auch als Bogenschütze waren die Kämpfe anspruchsvoll aber nicht unfair.

Inzwischen ist alles anders.
Seit das Spiel Freemium (Free2Play) ist, sind die Preise der Waffen und Rüstungsteile um Faktor X gestiegen.
Inzwischen kosten fast alle waffen 100.000 Gold (umgerechnet 5-10 €?). Und das ohne weitere Upgrades.
Da die Waffen aber alle unterschiedliche Stats haben und man eine tatsächliche Ewigkeit bräuchte um das Geld in Schlachten zu verdienen ist das Spiel zu Pay2Win verkommen.

Ganz zu schweigen von den ganzen Griefern und Glitchern die selbst Standard-DM zur Hölle machen.
Rennen weg, springen auf Zäune/Dächer/Palmen(?) und verstecken sich irgendwie in Heuballen, die man selbst weder betreten kann - noch bei denen man in der Lage ist Schaden zuzufügen.
Während ich früher (Großteil meiner Spielzeit) mit positiven Stats aus dem Spiel gehn konnte.. wäre es jetzt wohl eine KD von 1/10. Ich nehme auch an dass das Game inzwischen hackerverseucht ist.. wills aber auch nicht wissen.

Das Spiel ist für mich gestorben und würde ich niemandem mehr weiter empfehlen.

As for the game itself? I mean its alright i guess, previous game had a much better atmosphere and horror factor, only thing this game has up on the first is the graphics which have been improved by a LOT. I would say its worth a buy if on sale or in a bundle with the whole trilogy. | This game has nothing on the original. Everything that made the original so enjoyable is sadly lacking in this sequel. The guns suck because they lack power, the slow motion is boring compared to the original, and you can no longer lean around corners. Overall, this game feels like a downgraded cod campaign with horror themes - a real shame because the original (despite being 20 years old) is one of the most enjoyable fps campaigns I've ever played. | it's alright, i prefer a lot of the mechanics and visuals from the original, although you CAN drive the powered armor, so it lowkey peak and the mini DLC is also pretty fun | It's a generic shooter, albeit well-done, but it fails to recapture what made F.E.A.R. so great: its atmosphere. The level design is diverse and much more memorable (I'm thinking about the school especially), but it's a step backward in the horror section and the enemy AI. It's still fun, but it's not as good as it should be. 

Technically, it really feels like you're playing a PC game whose sequel was designed for consoles first, and then, has been ported to PC with fewer features than its original game had. You can't even quick-save, the save system is based around checkpoints. There's no FOV slider, you'll have to change that manually.

76561197970698176,107300,Breath of Death VII,0.0,"Indie, RPG",0,"This is a VERY short old-school styled RPG, taking around 5 hours to beat (or 6-7 if you want to tackle the optional boss and do the necessary level grinding). It's more so a parody and homage to the beginning games of Breath of Fire, Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy, so the writing and story is not really anything special or captivating.

That being said, it is still a very fun game, with some unique mechanics that I think serve the game very well. For Random battles, each area only has a certain amount of random battles before they atop appearing, however if you need to grind gold or experience, you can always choose the ""FIGHT"" option from the menu even after your allotted random battles are used up. In addition, after each turn the enemies will get 10% stronger so you do have a pseudo time limit to finish battles quickly, but to make up for this, your HP is fully restored after each fight. This mechanic of making enemies stronger after each turn means boss fights become challenging as you need to kill them before their attacks just starting wiping your party.

Each party member only has about 5 pieces of equipment they can get in the game, all straight upgrades from each other, so you don't need to worry too much about min-maxing equipment, just play and enjoy.

The crux comes down to: Can you get $3 worth of entertainment out of this game and the other one that comes bundled with it? Absolutely. Battle mechanics are interesting. The character build system is interesting. Some of the equipment choices are meaningful (For example, I kept the shotgun equipped the whole way up to just before the end boss). The humor is kind of hit or miss but there are enough hits to make it worth while. Plenty of references if that's your sort of thing.","a bit stale, but it's fun."

And it maybe good for those who can enjoy long time RPG battles and the story of this game. For me the flaw of this game is too significant to play.

First, I can't save game at any time and the map is too large for the gap between save points. That almost ruins all game experience for me. 

Second, the in-game scenes are lack of decoration, bad looking. The scenes are something like 1st generation Pokemon map but 10x large. Scenes are sometimes similar to each other, make you easy to get lost there. I remember I took several battles then start to wonder, is it a deeper scene? Then I saw the bridge, oh, maybe I go a wrong way. Then started to go back. Then I saw another bridge, crab, that is where I come. Both of these scenes have bridges and none of them are distinguishable.

«Deus Ex: Human Revolution» - это третья игра из вселенной «Deus Ex» и по мне она была, есть и будет самой лучшей в серии. 
Уже с самого начала геймплея ощущается, что вас ждёт захватывающее приключение в этом стильном и проработанном мире киберпанка, и с каждой минутой, проведённой в ней данное чувство становится всё сильнее и сильнее. 

Из плюсов этой игры вас ожидают:
- Практически совершенный и вариативный геймплей;
- Уникальная система прокачки и улучшений, позволяющие ещё больше разнообразить прохождение;
- Отлично проработанный мир в киберпанк стиле;
- Система диалогов, способная держать в напряжении, ведь от ваших действий зависит то, каким способом будет получена нужная информация;
- Продвинутая боевая система, которая не даст вам заскучать на протяжении долгого времени;
- Сюжет, держащий в напряжении до самого конца;
- Атмосферный саундтрек, в особенности главная тема;
- Уникальные и хорошо проработанные дополнительные квесты.
Не обошлось в данном шедевре и без минусов, которые можно пересчитать по пальцам одной руки, но тем не менее они присутствуют и вот главные из них:
- Устаревшая даже для своего времени графика и анимация;
- Вторая половина игры, которая откровенно слабее первой и не способна постоянно держать в тонусе из –за своего некого однообразия.

Но не стоит отчаиваться, ведь достоинства в разы перевешивают эти незначительные недостатки, а значит ,что данная игра придётся по вкусу практически всем. Не рекомендую только тем, кто уж очень не любит Киберпанк, но даже таким людям сама механика игры может понравиться настолько, что они забудут о стиле и будут крошить всех налево и направо, ну или будут бесшумными ниндзя.

Оценка: 9.0 баллов | Deus Ex was mostly fantastic! The game has you play as Adam Jensen, a guy who definitely didn't ask for this.

The controls and the movement and the styling of the game is all superb; perhaps a little lacking on the ""generic bad guys standing in the halls"" graphics, but what else is new. 

The gameplay is fun and intuitive, and provides a huge, huge wealth of story. Which, is what the game mainly comprises of. If you want an all-action shooty game, you'll have an ""okay"" time in Deus Ex. If you want an enthralling, twisty ""ohmigoshnohedidnt"" story, with tonnes of little snippets and extras to unlock ingame then this is the game for you.

Dungeons: The Dark Lord is a disappointing game that feels more like an unfinished product than a polished release. While the concept of managing your own dungeon sounds appealing, the execution is severely lacking. The game suffers from constant crashes, which make it nearly impossible to enjoy. These abrupt and frequent crashes, often without any clear cause, completely disrupt gameplay and make progress feel futile and frustrating.

To make matters worse, the game forces players to create and log into a Kalypso account just to access it. This unnecessary and intrusive DRM adds an extra layer of frustration, making what should be a straightforward experience feel tedious and unwarranted.

Despite its potential, the game's lack of stability and absence of updates to address its glaring issues demonstrate how little care was given to maintaining it. Instead of delivering a smooth and enjoyable experience, it feels like a neglected product left behind by its developers.

For a game that demands your time and money, Dungeons: The Dark Lord offers very little in return. Its technical instability, neglected design, and unnecessary barriers fail to deliver on its premise.

I strongly recommend avoiding this title. There are far better dungeon management games on the market that are worth your time. As it stands, Dungeons: The Dark Lord should either be heavily updated or removed from Steam altogether.

The only winning move is not to play.
How about a nice game of chess? | Probably the single most thought-provoking game I have ever played in my life.
I would recommend playing with friends as it can be quite hard to find a server. 
Although not the easiest to do you can mod the game to add land and sea based MIRVs, satellites, and more.

You cannot win. | This game is a tense, sombre and exciting version of risk with nuclear warheads. It's interesting to play and watch with friends but also strangers and bots to pad out the player count. The fact that you can still find people to play with almost 18 years after release is a testament to this games re-playability and design. It looks just as you would imagine a 'big map' would, like the war room of Dr Strange Love and similar. As with all good games the mechanics that are easy to learn, but with no one way of playing the game you could spend forever perfecting different strategies. Very highly recommend. | I would have to say this is a genuine love letter to the ICONIC movie WARGAMES (1983).  This game balances simple with strategic RTS tropes and delivers it nostalgically,.  Unlike other seriously indepth RTS games which often take hours to play.  DEFCON I have owned for several years and personally I think its a great game to play to have just some general fun and guess I would call it ..... RISK with nukes, a very simple yet exciting recreation of Global Thermonuclear war. 

Game mechanics are simple and easy and a game could be played within an hour and with the option to speed up slow parts of the game, it truly offers a very fun gather some friends and nuke the crap out of each other in good fun.  Everyone loses but who ever loses the least wins.  

Many people often may over look a simple game like this, trust me there is strategy to be found here, without the complexity of very intricate games.   

The other benefit is this is great for a LAN party as this game is an amazing multiplayer game offering 6+ AI or human players.  The game is small but nostalgically relevant.  It's a great time with friends and allows for some quick paced Armageddon.  It's really alot of fun and its great to pick up have a couple games to warm up in a game night then move to other games. I really think this game is a hidden gem.  It delivers what the games theme offers.  Global Thermonuclear War, at its simplistic best.  Have bought this game several times.  enjoy.

76561197970698176,24420,Aquaria,0.6166666666666667,Indie,0,"Под описание к данной игре, на мой взгляд, подходит выражение: от любви до ненависти один шаг. И игра Aquaria тот самый случай, когда негатив, от прохождения игры, порой тебя накрывает, буквально, с головой. Начинается это с момента, когда ты заплываешь в новую локацию, и поскольку кристаллы сохранения находятся на достаточном удалении друг от друга, тебя убивают и ты начинаешь свое исследование по новой. 
Я привык, что в хороших метройдваниях HP выпадает из всех поверженных врагов. Тут же разработчики пошли по другому пути. HP выпадает далеко не из всех врагов, чаще не выпадает вообще. По мимо этого в игре есть система крафта, когда ты, путем смешивания различных ингредиентов, получаешь продукт с необычными свойствами. С этим есть небольшие заморочки и плюс ко всему теряется темп игры, когда тебе во время ожесточенного боя приходится смешивать ингредиенты, чтобы элементарно подлечиться.
Это и управление в местах, где надо передвигаться по суше. Это отдельный вид боли и потраченных в пустую нервов.
За что же так полюбилась данная игра, дак это гениальная задумка разработчиков. Что как в метройдвании нам, в процессе игры, предстоит совершенствовать главного героя путем приобретения новых форм. И в основе каждой новой формы лежит сочетание звуков и цветов. Т.е. чтобы изменить свою форму надо исполнить определенную последовательность звуков, которые обозначены разными цветами и рисунками. И хорошо, что во время битвы с различными боссами, когда нам для победы требуется использовать несколько форм, они сменяются клавишами цифр на клавиатуре.
Так же музыкальное и визуальное оформление данной игры оставляет добрые положительные эмоции. Имеется и сюжетная история о потерянных воспоминаниях. В общем это те положительные моменты, которые остаются в памяти на долго.
Игру однозначно рекомендую, но порой очень непросто разобраться с отдельными загадками и с методами, как одержать победу над очередным боссом не читая гайдов. | 2007年大放异彩的神作，距今已经有18年了

I didn't have a steam account and didn't have money, so what does a kid with unrestricted internet access and little understanding of hardware do? I pirated the game of course! 

Only there's the big problem of only having my parents very poor dell computer that was the equivalent of a potato, I didn't really understand what hardware even was beyond it was supposed to run on computers 3:<

So I played this game for at least 30 hours over and over again and played it at the smallest windowed resolution possible so I could actually play the game and didn't give a fuck, this game was awesome, I loved it. 

So now I've bought it properly, played it some more and honestly?
This game fucks, but it has problems. Some big problems. Mainly with the actual combat system.
This game toes the line between third person action and fighting game but doesn't really know what to do with it, so you have punches, kicks, low kicks heavy attacks but then you also can run up walls to go flying in the air and jump kick everyone, turns out jump kicking is the strongest attack, nearly unstoppable, and will pretty much murder everyone which I feel does reflect the fact you're a giant bunny man pretty well, but leaves the actual gameplay rather shallow. There's blocking and parrying, even weapon throwing, but when you have one answer to all of these things and when the game get's harder it just means the ai will just perfectly use all these tools, so it nearly forces you to jump kick. 

I love this game, I really do, and I'll keep playing it some more because I do love this. It's just that there's an obvious issue that needs some tuning to be perfect, and I suppose that's without mentioning that the game feels hardcore indie, like this is very clearly not a polished game and feels more like a project than a product. That doesn't mean the game isn't cool though. | gameplay is pretty simple, really only consisting of parkour, combat, and stealth. none of them are particularly deep, but the combat is just so damn good despite how simple it is. the physics/skeletal based health system makes fighting feel so weighty and visceral and ive sunken dozens and dozens of hours into the arena mode alone just from how addicting it is. the ""OHHH SHIT"" feeling of getting kicked in the stomach and having your head bang against the wall and knock you out is so satisfying even on the receiving end. i would argue the arena mode itself justifies a purchase

the parkour is also pretty solid. there's nothing really special about it besides the giant jump distance and height you have by default. much like the combat it's simple yet engaging and satisfying. stealth is also largely the same. you can sneak around and grab enemies to choke them out or slit their throat before dragging them elsewhere so any patrolling enemies dont find them.

the entire game has a very ""natural"" feel to it as even the animations are somewhat physics-based. it lends to a very tactile and satisfactory feeling behind everything you do. your momentum increases as you run down slopes, your dropkicks turn explosive depending on your velocity, simple blows or tumbles can turn lethal if you hit your head in just the right way, etc. highly recommend for the combat alone. | Amazing game. 9/10 Would reccomend, Awesome graphics, creative story for both therium and overgrowth, and pristeen combat.

Les graphismes ne sont pas mauvais, pas plus que le bestiaire, mais il manque deux composantes essentielles qui rendaient Serious Sam unique :

Premièrement, il n’y a plus du tout de voyage dans le temps. L’histoire est une préquelle, dans laquelle Sam Stone doit utiliser la machine à voyager dans le temps qui l’emmènera dans l’Égypte antique, là où se déroule le premier épisode. Plus de dépaysement tel que les trois jeux précédents nous avaient présentés. On erre dans un Caire contemporain sinistré comme une zone de guerre.

Deuxièmement, le principe des hordes d’ennemis n’est plus aussi « énorme » que dans les autres épisodes. J’ai définitivement arrêté quand je me suis retrouvé dans des ruelles étroites avec des ennemis qui apparaissaient systématiquement dans mon dos pour me tirer dessus. Finis les grands espaces farcis de caisses de munitions.

En bref, ce jeu est sérieusement raté. Espérons que les programmeurs sachent se rattraper. | Serious Sam 2 was better... The Devs should play less CoD and remember what a boomer shooter should be like.

Level Design: Pretty Shit, ungodly amount of dark tunnels with the smallest flashlight. Only beige sandy levels or dark tunnels with almost no light

Pros:

+ All 12 races have unique tech trees, AI personalities, diplomacy text and more.
+ Chess-engine type dynamic AI that has not been surpassed in any other 4X game and plays by the same rules as you.
+ Truly impactful galactic event system that keeps each game fresh.
+ Lots of different strategies to excel in, from influence, economy, diplomacy to war.
+ Actually really nice soundtrack for a 4X game.
+ Ability to create and download custom races and ship styles. (You can totally set up all Star Trek races).
+ A lot of content after 3 expansions, both in mechanics and in campaigns.
+ Well balanced and bug free after many years of community patches.
+ Runs on any computer and looks alright if you max everything out.

Cons:

- it's a game from 2008, expect some really shitty CGI and a lot of videos and UI elements to look a little low-res on modern resolutions.
- No in-game encyclopedia leaves you looking through the included manual, ""Community Edition Guide"" and old forum threads to figure out the intricacies of gameplay mechanics as the game came out before community game wikis became commonplace. 
- Default ship designs are lacking, you are forced to use the ship builder to make optimized ship designs, this can be a chore and will lead to ugly designs if you can't bother to take the time to artfully place the modules.
- Ship designer does not let you modify the auto-generated designs.
- Suffers from the common ""Space is empty"" curse. No actual terrain, lots of uncolonizable planets and just deep space that is not fun or very distinctive either visually or strategically.
- Compared to stuff like Stellaris, planets are mostly samey as well.
- Civ4 style stacked combat system that does not really care for positioning outside of starbases.

 
Overall I would recommend it just for the very tight gameplay loop and good AI leading to very interesting gameplay. | O jogo é desafiador e bem completo. Cada raça tem vantagens e desvantagens e trazem caminhos distintos para a vitória. | Yet another fun 4x game franchise.

[spoiler]从库存堆里掏出来，游戏通关哩，撒花~❀❀❀[/spoiler]
虽然游戏没有中文，但剧情简单粗暴，简直就是现代版的金庸武侠！老大怀疑主角的忠心，让他杀掉自己的爱人以示投名状，闪客不忍不从，于是老大派出手下四大手下来追杀这对主角夫妇。主角闪客死里逃生，但爱人惨死[典中典]。七年之后，深陷犯罪集团阴谋的Shank，将用最残暴的方式踏过地下世界的尸山血海。这场浸透鲜血的复仇之旅，每一帧都迸发着怒火与决绝。

《Shank》是一款致敬经典的横版清关动作游戏，由获奖工作室Klei Entertainment打造。在这部充满邪典电影风格的暴力美学作品中，你将化身主角Shank，在血肉横飞的战场中体验极致的杀戮快感——敌人如潮水般涌来，连击系统酣畅淋漓，头目战设计震撼人心！游戏于2010年10月26日登陆Steam平台，并根据玩家反馈优化了操作手感与平衡性调整。准备好用刀枪开辟血路，开启一场复仇狂欢吧！

[h2]核心特点：[/h2]
[h3]暴力漫画艺术风格[/h3]
由资深导演Jeff Agala操刀，以流畅如动态漫画的分镜与动画，呈现黑帮世界的黑暗美学。画面确实帅炸，但有时候血喷得太多，我都分不清自己在砍人还是砍番茄酱瓶子。
[h3]武器连击系统[/h3]
自由组合刀、枪、链锯等致命武器，创造千变万化的连击招式，让敌人永远猜不到下一击从何而来。
[h3]电影级过场动画[/h3]
通过精美动画片段沉浸式体验Shank的复仇史诗，每一场杀戮都有故事的温度。
[h3]残酷头目对决[/h3]
8场风格迥异的史诗级Boss战，用策略与操作碾压身形数倍于你的疯狂对手。
[h3]本地双人合作模式[/h3]
邀请好友共同血战！在独立于主线的合作剧情中，挑战成群的武装暴徒，揭开单机故事的前传秘辛。

[h2]缺点/不足吐槽：[/h2]
[h3]没有中文[/h3]
虽然剧情简单易懂，但没中文还是有点劝退。尤其是过场动画里的对话细节，Klei工作室，你们是觉得我们中国玩家都自带翻译器吗？
[h3]流程偏短以及老套[/h3]
动画确实好看，但剧情有点老套，典型的“你杀我老婆，我杀你全家”套路。普通模式通关大概2.5小时左右，虽然爽快但意犹未尽。刚进入状态，游戏就结束了，感觉像是吃了一顿快餐，还没吃饱就没了。
[h3]重复性较高[/h3]
砍完第100个小兵后，我已经分不清他们是谁了，反正都是“血包”。敌人种类和场景设计有点单一，后期容易审美疲劳。
[h3]操作门槛[/h3]
连击系统虽然爽，但对新手不太友好，手残党可能会被虐到自闭。特别是我明明按的是“砍人”，为什么角色在“跳舞”？手残党慎入！按错一个键，可能就从“华丽连招”变成“原地发呆”“罚站”。Boss战设计很棒，但某些Boss的难度曲线堪比过山车，前一秒还在虐菜，下一秒强度就上来了。

[hr][/hr]
总结：
《Shank》是一款充满暴力美学的横版动作游戏，适合喜欢爽快战斗和复仇剧情的玩家。虽然有些小缺点，但整体体验依然值得一试。如果你是动作游戏爱好者，或者只是想找个发泄压力的方式，那么《Shank》绝对能满足你！

评分：8/10
推荐人群：动作游戏爱好者、暴力美学爱好者、手速达人、有朋友的幸运儿。
慎入人群：手残党、剧情党、单身狗（双人模式警告）（单身狗默默流泪）。

Это игра не стала исключением - открытие персонажа Commander Video впоследствии привело меня сюда. Игра авто-раннер без права на ошибку - умер, начинай все заново. Окей, привыкнуть можно. Первый мир абсолютный среднячок, вывозит только тем что он служит ролью ""обучения"", второй уже намного лучше в плане атмосферы и дизайна. Третий... Дайте мне немного времени, и после плюсов я обязательно вернусь к нему :)
+ Дизайн уровней. Конкретно 2-ого и 3-его Мира, несмотря на то что цель всей игры НЕ ОТВЛЕКАТЬСЯ на посторонние мельтешащие объекты, окружение достаточно проработано, и довольно атмосферно.
+ Музыка максимально средняя. Здесь нет никаких раскачивающих тебя треков (кроме босс-файтов) и все держится на (почти) одной и той же мелодии. Но напомню - в чем главная цель игры? Проходя по 40 раз уровень уже и не думаешь о ее существовании.
+ В игре есть несколько разнообразных боссов. Из них самый приятный 2-ой, у остальных ты больше проходишь сам уровень, нежели босса. 

И на этом плюсы у игры заканчиваются. Я старался выделить в них то что меня удивило в начале игры, но так как я (как и лишь 7% комьюнити) дошли до 3-его Мира, больше хорошего сказать мне нечего. Время минусов:
- Авто-раннер без права на ошибку. Эта игра считай похоронила себя еще на начале, ведь чем не приятное чувство когда ты дошел до середины/конца уровня, врезался в объект и начинаешь все заново :))) Ну, ты учтешь свою ошибку и таки пройдешь уровень? Что-же, это работает так до определенных уровней, 1-11, 1-12, 2-9, и боже бл*ть (за мат не извиняюсь) уровни с 3-9 по 3-11. Здесь уже играет роль не только запоминание паттерна, но и насколько долго хватит тебя и твоего терпения, из раза в раз проходя [Интересные] и [Реально увлекательные] уровни.
- Разных Миров 3, но объекты в них играют одну и ту же роль, просто имея другую текстуру. В 1-ом Мире ты еще не знал чего ждать от игры, и все было в новинку, но потом у разработчиков кончилась фантазия. Удивительно как с таким ""разнообразием"" игру растянули на целых 33 уровня (не считая боссов)
- Кто тот гений из разработчиков, что решил добавить уровень 1-11 не в соответствующий его уровню сложности Мир? Если верить достоверности процентажа ачивок (на случай, если они не были сломаны долгое время) его прошло лишь 11% игроков. Таким образом большая часть комьюнити (89%) просто напросто отсеялась от игры, так и не осилив его. Все эти 3к положительных отзывов это те самые 11%? Или большая часть оценила лишь 1-ый Мир, который слабее чем последующие во всех смыслах?

[h1]Esta reseña no contiene spoilers[/h1]

Algunas veces nos encontramos con juegos realmente interesantes y originales por lo novedosa de su propuesta. Suelen ser juegos que se salen del estándar habitual y arriesgan ofreciendo algo poco visto con anterioridad. Este es el caso de este juego.

En esta aventura, controlaremos a Max, un niño que estaba dibujando tranquilamente en su casa cuando, de repente, el monstruo que había dibujado cobra vida y empieza a crear el caos. Al descubrirlo, Max decide entrar dentro de ese mundo para acabar con él.

El juego ofrece un planteamiento típico de plataformas. Tendremos que saltar, correr y todo ese tipo de cosas, pero lo original de este juego es que contaremos con un rotulador que tendremos que utilizar para dibujar objetos que ayuden a Max a superar los diferentes retos que se le planteen.

Por ejemplo, Max puede llegar a una zona muy alta, donde no podrá acceder a menos que realice un gran salto. Para ello, tendremos que crear con la ayuda de nuestro rotulador una rampa donde pueda subirse Max y, además, crear una gran piedra que lanzaremos desde las alturas.

Como este ejemplo, hay cientos. Y seremos nosotros los que tengamos que averiguar qué es lo que necesita Max para superar todos los obstáculos. Además, la tinta del rotulador mágico no será infinita, por lo que no podremos hacer todo lo que queramos, haciendo este hecho que todo se vuelva más interesante.

El juego tiene claramente un cariz infantil, pero eso no quiere decir que no pueda ser disfrutado por todo el mundo. Al fin y al cabo, no todos los días podemos pintar en nuestro monitor a mano alzada y que eso se convierta en un elemento jugable.

Los gráficos del juego son muy agradables, y están bastante bien realizados. Y lo mismo sucede con la música, con unas melodías bastante pegadizas y amenas. En general, como todo el resto del juego, porque si hay algo que destaca de este juego es su amabilidad.

No será un reto acabarse el juego, pero ten por seguro que será una experiencia bastante agradable y entretenida. Además de ser una bastante original.

Por todo ello, si buscas algo diferente a lo ya visto con anterioridad, este juego puede ofrecerte aquello que estás buscando. Originalidad y entretenimiento amable y desenfadado a partes iguales. | Eines der besten Spiele überhaupt.
Genial ist, dass man es lokal im Coop zocken kann. Einer steuert Max, der andere den magischen Stift.

So wird die Angelegenheit auch sehr schnell zur Herausfoderung, wenn der fünfjährige Sohn mit Max durch den Level rusht und Papa ihn mittels Magic Maker am Leben halten darf^^

Nur schade, dass das Spiel auf Steam nicht mehr gekauft werden kann, da Microsoft sich alle Keys (und Rechte?) gerafft hat. | 横スクロール型物理アクションゲーム。魔法のペンで書いた絵が実体化され、実体化されたものは、空中にあれば落下し、地面に当たればひっかかる。その性質をうまく利用して、描いたものを足場や乗り物、重しなどにして利用し、マップを進んでいく。難易度はわりと低め。 | short version: i highly recommend this game for younger players and/or on discounts
longer version:  by looking at the screen shots you can see what the concept of the game is. draw things to help the platforming. me and my niece played about 30 hours (one drawing, the other platforming) of this game when she was about 6 and she loved it (as did i :P ). the game ran smoothly and i don’t recall ever having technical difficulties with this game (at the time, 32bit vista)
why are people dissatisfied and or saying this is a kids game?
. basic platforming with little depth (not fast and tight like Meat Boy or with power ups like Mario)
. the drawing mechanic has little depth. (for the most part you just draw lines to jump on)
. i liked the colour pallet, character designs and animation but they clearly set a light fun child friendly mood
. basic plot (spoiler alert, max gets a magic marker -.- )",Max decides to enter this world to end with him.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1yNZ6g303k

O game é um FPS lançado em 2012, mas que bate de frente com boa parte dos jogos de tiro em primeira pessoa que nós temos até hoje.

Em parte pelo seu gráfico cell-shading, que estiliza o game a ponto de não ficar datado (e combinando muito mais com a HQ do que o poço de piche que foi o game de 2007) e, em outra, porque a sua gameplay é MUITO BOA.

Tipo, MUITO BOA.

A ação é rápida, frenética e precisa - frequentemente regada por fluídos corporais de procedência criminosa - e entrega um shooter com elementos a la DOOM 2016 quatro anos antes do terror dos cramunhão, envolvendo golpes corpo a corpo, execuções que garantem diferentes ""benefícios"" (só pra gente, no caso) e interações com o cenário que transformam uma porta de carro num escudo balístico ou uma tampa de lixeira em uma serra voadora tão potente que você só encontra no canal da Polishop.

A história é bem padrãozinha e, mesmo não sendo incrível, cumpre o seu papel e te direciona para onde a ação acontece, enquanto o modo multiplayer (que você também pode jogar sozinho) traz o nome de ""Vendettas"" e funciona como uma campanha para até 4 jogadores no estilo do CoD Zombies, na qual cada um controla um personagem diferente que também aparece nos quadrinhos.

Ainda assim, vale avisar que você zera a campanha numas 5, 6 horinhas de gameplay (liberando o NG+) e, pra quem acha que isso é pouco... Eu concordo. Mas a rejogabilidade é boa e dá pra zerar mais de uma vez pelos colecionáveis ou só pela diversão mesmo.

Em resumo, é um jogaralho que eu curti demais em 2012 e curti ainda mais em 2025 (principalmente porque, de uns tempos pra cá, jogo bom tá difícil).

Recomendo totalmente para qualquer fã de quadrinhos que curta um FPS violentão cheio de ação e porradaria (e vice e versa).

Ah, e passa lá no canal pra dar uma força <3

 | Si un jeux Venom devait exister dans le futur, il serait surement une copie de The Darknes, mélanger le plaisir d'être possédé par un symbiote a celui d'être le DOOM Slayer et vous voila avec The Darknes, un jeux qui a compris ce que l'on voulait voir et vivre si un symbiote existait. | Fabuła spoko, gameplay ssie, gra jest do bólu powtarzalna a wrażliwość bohatera na światło jest mega irytująca i przeciwnicy są jak gąbki na pociski.","The Darkness II is not only a FPS lançado in 2012, but it plays out front with good part of the dungeons em first person we have at this moment. Part of its cell-shading graphics, which stylize the game at the point of not being datad (and combining much more with HQ than the poco of paint that was a 2007 game) and, in other words, because its gameplay is MUITO BOA."

76561197970698176,64000,Men of War: Assault Squad,0.0,Strategy,0,"Its a broken game, half the time units don't respond to commands, enemies often glitch out and don't attack, the camera is buggy and doesn't respond just the same, graphics are full of glitches with shadows glitching as you move the camera around, I'm just perplexe at the low quality of this game and the apparent enthusiasm around it. It's worse than Sudden Strike 4 and that says a lot, at least I had the patience to play 3 missions with the latter before wanting to throw my keyboard out of the window. | Campaign completely impossible. Number of enemies is greater than the number of your bullets, and bodies disappear instantly making it impossible to loot, enemy tanks kill your tank with one shot while your tank can't kill enemy tanks from the front. | So here's the thing I've played several Men of War games already right like the older, classic ones and I even played Faces of War which as far as I know came out even before the Men of War series truly became a thing right. In those older Men of War games I thought the difficulty get annoying at points but you could still win either by spamming shit out until you overran the enemy defenses or by getting a big enough cannon and blowing shit up from far away. Faces of War was the only one where I thought the difficulty was annoyingly stupid and felt like I had to save scum to get past the levels which is why I ended up not finishing that game and just wrote a review when I thought I was comfortable enough with it. Now here's Men of War Assault Squad and it is, for me at least, pretty much a direct copy of Faces of War.

+The graphics look wonderful. Sounds are great. Controls are great as well, easy to use. The game ran without any issues, any crashes nothing.
+3 missions each for the Americans, Germans, Commonwealth, Soviets and Japanese. Each mission even on the easy difficulty can be very challenging and can take up to an hour to beat. In the campaings generally you're just put on a map with a ton of places to capture and you're given command points with which you can buy more units. Capture more points, unlock better units, buy them, use them, capture every point on the map and win the mission. Repeat for every faction, every mission.
+Tons of units, tons of vehicles, in the classic Men of War fashion not only are you ordering your units around like a real time strategy game but you can take direct control of them as well. Bought yourself a Panther, Tiger, Sherman, some random Japanese tank, maybe a half track full on infantry, maybe one of those late war German Goliath remote detonated bombs you can just take direct control of them, drive them around, shoot whatever. You can take direct control of single infantry units as well, run around with a machine gun in your hand if you want.
+Another thing I love about the Men of War series in general is the damage models on the vehicles. Your little AT gun is up against a Tiger and you can't pen it? Just shoot its tracks and immobilize it. You're in the Tiger and you saw that AT gun? Just gun down the crew and order your own infantry to man the gun, this way you'll capture the enemy AT gun for free. You're idk in a Sherman and you fired a shell at an enemy tank aside from the tracks you can damage its gun, turret, hull, engine and obviously blow it up instantly with a well placed shot. If it hasn't suffered some serious critical damage it can be repaired and put back into action.

-In pretty much every single mission you're going up against well entrenched enemy forces with a very small army of your own. If that wasn't enough the enemy can and will call in reinforcements just like you so every now and then you'll have a sudden wave of enemy infantry charging and recapturing the points you already took some other times they'll send random tanks towards you which can cause quite the headache. Running out of points to buy more units and having your own units massacred by tons of machine guns and tanks is pretty common. Even on easy. I'm not a good player sure but holy fuck do you really have to make me run across an open field covered with 3 different heavy artillery guns, 3-4 other really damn big AT guns, infantry all over the place... I send my most heavily armored vehicle in, AT guns and the artillery fucks it up. I send the infantry in well guess what its an open field they're crossing and at the end is a bunch of sand bags, machine guns, AT guns, artillery and tons of infantry why would they ever succeed in that situation? I send both the vehicles and the infantry at the same time, combined arms warfare shit and EVERYONE dies. I'm not joking the only reason I won one of the missions is because some enemy AT and artillery pieces friendly fired each other so I got to cross the open field and capture the point with just overwhelming numbers. It was silly. This was the first mission in the German campaing. On easy. Again call me stupid if you want but fuck me this game is so hard that I failed the American training mission against the Japanese several times. I had to switch from normal to easy, fail again and THEN I won the training mission. Moved to the Japanese campaing, got fucked on the first mission. German campaing, got fucked on the first mission still won by pure luck but that should not have worked.

If it wasn't for the absurd difficulty I think I'd enjoy it a lot. I mean I still did enjoy it but definitely nowhere near as much as I could have. Winning too easily, crushing the enemy isn't fun. Losing too easily, being crushed isn't fun. It has to be in the middle where it feels like luck or a really good decision in a bad moment turned the tide you know? Thats not here, its just an uphill battle and while coming out on top does feel good after fighting against a shit ton of enemies its not the same kind of fun you'd get, not the same kind of good feeling you'd get from a better, more balanced mission right? I'm pretty sure I gave Faces of War a thumbs up which, looking back on it after a long time, was probably not a good idea. Similar to Faces of War I want to give this game a thumbs up too they were both incredibly difficult, overwhelming and annoying but the core gameplay is so cool that I wanna ignore it but I did that mistake on the Faces of War review and I feel bad about it and I think I should change it to a negative one instead so I'm gonna learn from my mistake and just give this one a negative review instead. Which isn't fair I don't think I wish I could give a mixed rating but I can't. The core gameplay is really fun and nice but the campaings feel incredibly unfair to the point where it makes the entire thing annoying. Either way negative it is, we'll see if Assault Squad 2 is any better when I someday get around to reviewing that one. | Советую покупать сразу men of war assault squad 2.

Засчет ""невидимых"" блоков каждая комната воспринимается как ""terra incognita"", которую интересно ""разведывать"". Также сами игровые экраны спроектированы очень грамотно и постепенное введение новых препятствий не дает заскучать. 

Этот проект - эталон того, как вокруг одной простой идеи можно выстроить интересный геймплей.

Из минусов могу отметить почти отсутствующее музыкальное сопровождение. Хотелось бы более интересный эмбиент, нежели единичные ноты пианино, хотя я понимаю, что такой звук выбран намерено под стать минималистичному артдизайну.

Steam Deck: Playable, but pretty much requires an external mouse

*sigh*  This game.  I wanted to like this game.  A metroidvania without guns and an interesting sound design.  Heck, I wanted to LOVE it.  It's a really interesting idea.  Sure, the level design can be weak, being VERY fond of unrecoverable falls that make you go the LONG (really, really long) way around to try again.  And the controls can be a bit wonky.  But there was a steady feeling of progress and learning that didn't make it seem so bad most of the time.

And then I got to the final boss.  And the final boss is the most aggressively unfun experiences I have ever had in gaming.  Nowhere else in the game can you die, except the final boss.  Ok.  You can only take one hit.  The boss has (at least) four phases, and you have to start over from the very beginning if you die.  Been through worse.  You have to touch all of certain nodes around the screen before you can hurt the boss.  Sounds normal.  The boss can hide out of bounds and still hit your characters.  Not particularly fair, but fine.  The boss can cancel out your nodes FASTER than you can touch all of the nodes.  And your jump height and reach are tied to how many nodes you have touched.  ...

...

OH COME ON NOW.  There are bosses of skill.  There are bosses of memorization.  And then there are bosses of pure luck, that sometimes say, ""You're going to lose now,"" and there is nothing you can do about it.  In the third phase of the boss, you have to touch 12 notes.  Roughly every second the boss, who is probably sitting out of bounds, sends 3 attacks at you.  If you are close to one of the nodes, they will cancel out your having touched it.  Your jump height is tied to how many nodes you have touched.  So you can jump, have the bomb explode, reducing your jump height, fall into the explosion, and die.  You have a teleport ability.  You need to use the ability to get near some of the nodes, which are all at or in the walls.  You try to use the ability to teleport to one of the nes while being attacked.  But you jumped, so the screen shifted.  Now you're either jumping into the wall, in which case nothing happens, and you die.  Or you teleport short, which is within the explosion range, and you die.

I grinded the final boss until my hand cramped.  One time I ended up in a continuous figure eight cycle, touching node 12 just as the boss cancelled out node 11.  I finally beat phase 3.  Phase 4 started, the boss shot a batch of explosives at me, I hit an invisible wall, I died.  Less than 2 seconds, total.

I quit at 97% completion rather than beat the boss.  THAT'S how fun the end of the game is.",The first time I played it I was a bit disappointed.

作为一款物理游戏，Snuggle Truck做到了将保护自然（拯救小动物）、卡通元素融入汽车竞速这一创举。游戏用来打发时间十分不错。在上手以后你会发现，拯救小动物还是那么困难#斜眼笑。 | Plays well, no issues and fun.
Some levels trickier than others.
Lasted me 48 hours getting everything.
Pretty fun and worth it.
Clean HUD. | The mechanics are solid, there is depth in terms of content, and the execution is superb. I wouldn’t call this one a “thrill ride,” but Snuggle Truck can be your burst game, that title you play when you’ve got three minutes to spare.

It’s hard to just peg Snuggle Truck in a genre. I call it a side-scrolling racing game and then toss in the caveat that it’s highly physics-based. In the game, you control a dirty truck that can be highly reactive to the terrain its meets -- the smallest dips and jumps cause the truck to lean back and forth. You can correct its arc with the arrow keys, but you don’t do it for the safety of the vehicle -- you get lined up to protect the cargo, those cartoon animals riding in the back. Each animal is just as reactive to the truck’s trajectory, and the point is to hit the end point as quickly as possible with as many animals as possible. Easier said than done, I've learned. 

There’s a lot of stuff that can get in your way in the process of getting to the end goal, the ""zoo"": there’s an assortment of bumps, massive hills, dips, and even a few surprise environmental objects like explosive crates that get thrown into the mix in later levels. For the most part, Owlchemy Labs does a fantastic job providing change of pace opportunities: there’s a ton of different layouts and jumps experimented with, which give you plenty to do and think about.

Hitting and landing a jump without losing your animal dudes is all in the wrist and in the finger. You can use your keys to correct the trajectory and also use the basic movement mechanic -- pressing your fingers on either the up or the down key -- to slow or speed up your truck.

Snuggle Truck introduces one new mechanic at a time, giving you the ability to slowly learn and react to obstacles as you progress through the levels. But there’s a big trial-and-error element as well since you never know what’s around the bend. One small jump, for example, can take you straight into a wall while another of the same exact kind might not present any mission critical navigational issues.

To its credit, Snuggle Truck remains fun despite its clumps of middling level design. I chock this up to its relative snappiness -- levels take, generally, under a minute to finish, so it’s not a great loss to start over again. Nor do you really need to ace a level since there’s so many in each tier.

Of course, there are carrots on sticks to chase -- Snuggle Truck goes heavy on the rewards after completion of each level. You can earn your traditional star medals, as well as completion medals based on completion and number of animals you save.

While Snuggle Truck actually feels like a game that went one direction and then the other, I recommend it. The truck controls well, the physics respond well, and the level design has that right mix of snappiness and intrigue. Check it out if you’re in the market for another racing side-scroller, and keep your eyes peeled for updates. Owlchemy Labs has crazy plans for Smuggle Truck which include implementing community-generated levels which could lead to some awesome replay value. | Казуальный рейсинг с элементами аркады.

It's not my favorite by them, but it's still a very solid one where you play an enforcer part of a larger ruling system called Avadon and are given quite a lot of power to make choices and tough calls. It follows the Spiderweb Software formula to a tee being another retro-style RPG with plenty of turn-based combat but there's still a lot of cool fun and charm to be had here. | Because Steam only has a Up/Down rating and not a 'middle of the road' I'll err on giving it a positive for the interesting story and many options to change the course of what happens.
This RPG starts so easy that you left click your way through most fights with maybe an aoe spell or some healing, so easy I think the tutorial is the entire first mission. Then you hit the second area and suddenly you gotta really fight. That's great, I want enough of a challenge to think. Then the game slowly gets harder and this is also fine for a while.
You get better gear, more options, and the ability to choose all the classes plus the one you chose at the start to play as 'you', giving you a good feel fore flexible options, though one of the companions will always share your class choice, so that's either annoying or good for doubling up.
Then the enemies start spamming stuns, knock backs, charm, daze, slows, curses, and every other effect causing fights to drag if you don't focus on counter-buffing/cursing to keep them from riding on a million advantages. And, maybe it's just me, but Charm only seems to work 1/3 of the time while Daze gets really hard to rely on.
Then enemy HP bars become trees you need to saw through even if you've got the fight itself in the bag, with some bosses even spamming (group) heals so you'll need to saw through that. And their constant summon spam.
Then some enemies just get to move twice and others get that bonus while also casting buffs to move even more often, causing enemies to practically triple their action economy while slowing you to a crawl by throwing out more stuns, slows, or daze attacks. Hope you love fighting basilisk with cone-shaped aoe stuns. In groups. That eventually become elites.
The game's got a lot of great moments but eventually you just crawl through this swamp in every single fight just hoping to see the ending of it all as yet another boss just SPAMS and endless wave of foes that get to cast buffs too.
And the ending has some of the worst stun-locking jerks you'll ever encounter, alone. Because of course they had to put a rotten cherry on top.
But, then you get to see the reflection of all your choices during the entire game and a really see that they mattered. That you get to feel satisfied with the story, and if you really like the game, ready to follow their sequel bating. 

TLDR:
Combat starts too easy, gets good, gets grindy, ends up miserable.
Classes are fun but buff/debuff abilities start to feel out-right mandatory near the ending.
Enemies become tree's with loads of health to chew through and self-healing spam.
The story feels fun to explore and the ending actually changes based on your choices, with fun little mistakes you can make to change the outcome.

If you really love top down games this is still gunna be worth it, but you might need some leather to chew on for when the warriors all self-buff for bonus damage/hit and the archers cast group haste before their mage hits one of your party members with a charm. Ugh.

Контента не очень много, если сравнивать со среднестатистическими конкурентами, вроде ""Plants vs. Zombies"", ""Defender's Quest"" и даже ""Space Run"". И я сравниваю именно с играми в жанре башенной защиты, хотя это не точное сравнение, ведь ""Orcs Must Die!"" скорее боевик от третьего лица.
Оценивать игру в сравнении с другими похожими не хочется, потому что они будут иметь, очевидно, похожие недостатки. А оценивать в вакууме, в отрыве ото всех игр вообще - тоже, потому что персонаж там уже изолирован на небольших аренах, как в серии Painkiller.
Баги портят общее впечатление - от проваливающихся в текстуры врагов до люстр, замирающих при падении в баррикадах. Был даже баг, когда началась новая волна, хотя у прежней всё ещё был живой и здравствующий гоблин-шаман.
Поиск пути у врагов периодами выдаёт финты и заставляет застревать в самых неожиданных местах.
Баланс тоже далёк от творческой свободы - при кажущемся обилии ловушек, оружия, стражей и улучшений, у них не так много гибкости при размещении, и синергии между всем этим обилием очень мало.

Основной шарм в юморе и динамике, в постоянном давлении со стороны противника, а также в относительной свежести подхода на период выхода игры. Однако основная идея всех игр жанра Tower Defense в том, что игрок доминирует над положением и выстраивает большей частью автономную защиту, тогда как эта игра ближе к боевику, учитывая количество урона, которое должен наносить сам главный персонаж, бегая по арене, и возможностей выстроить автономную защиту здесь нет. Если же сравнивать игру с другими боевиками, то эта постоянная изоляция делает её очень скудной и однообразной.
Ярым поклонникам жанра, конечно же, лучше ознакомиться; тем более, если на всю серию уже регулярны высокие скидки от 80% и более. | Como la mayoría, habrán jugado este juego en versión pirata sin completar el juego. Ahora que lo tengo acá y lo completé, pues si valió la pena.

That said, I think it's pretty well made and does everything you'd want it to for this type of tower defense game.

This game has an art style that will be off-putting to many, but I found it charming in an odd way.  The different powers are interesting, but could be a little more imaginative and balance between them is basically non-existant.  For the most part, the powers don't make good use of the movement- and neither do the randomly generated maps that generally end up being narrow tunnels to fall down and strange ceilings.  The boss fights are slightly better by being a little more open, but overall it's very static and repetitive.

The game has a metric ton of good ideas, but the implementation and integration is so poor that everything steps on each other's toes.  In addition the game uses strange terminology and despite explaning itself is still pretty difficult to puzzle out.  Figuring it out is kind of fun, but once you unlock the puzzle you realize that it's a lot simpler than it lets on in a bad way and it's more about getting lucky early on with a co-operative starting area than anything else.  Speaking of Co-op, it is barely functional and requires a great deal of patience.  Still, it's nice to have the option to be able to suffer together.

To it's credit, I can't say I didn't have any fun, but bad platforming, dissonant storyline, confusing mechanics and characters and luck-based play (a decent beginning can trivialize the hardest difficulty but a bad one makes all but the easiest one impossible) as well as terrible implementation of platforming means I'm not going to be missing it. | Hoo boy.

The original [i]A Valley Without Wind[/i] struck me as about the quality of a particularly impressive bit of shareware in the late 90s: horribly dated by modern standards and without 1980s retro charm (though maybe that just means it came a decade early), but at the very least technically competent. Animations were smooth (though obviously based on some simple figure rendering program like Poser), the control scheme worked, the story didn't make much sense but a lot of 90s shareware didn't so I could at least poke around with it and be vaguely amused.

You will note that I only have 19 minutes on record with [i]A Valley Without Wind 2[/i].

I'm going to hold off on explaining why for just a moment. This sequel--if it can really be called that, since the whole [i]AVWW[/i] ""broken reality"" thing never made much narrative sense to begin with, and apparently intentionally so--has you running a rebellion against a big bad. Unlike the original [i]AVWW[/i], where you had followers who you would make go away for so many minutes to go gather firewood or whatever while you ran around the infinitely side-scrolling (well, infinitely transitioning, at least) map, this actually has a strategic map for you to tell your followers to go to places and do things and fight baddies. It's a nice touch, adding some level of strategic force movement rather than simply ""Bob has a 57% chance of getting a carrot with a 99% risk of dying because Bob is a loser.""

Well, I lie. It would've been a nice touch. If it worked.

If anything worked.

If [i]AVWW[/i] has the quality of decent 90s shareware, [i]AVWW2[/i] has the quality of [b]bad[/b] 90s shareware, the kind that I have spent a good decade and a half trying to forget that I grew up on. The characters have gone from smoothly-animated pre-rendered 3D geometry sprites to poorly MS Paint'd cartoons that move as though they're suffing grand mal seizures. In [i]AVWW[/i], everything was made of pre-rendered sprites so it all fit together visually. Random elements in [i]AVWW2[/i] are pre-rendered, some are drawn, others are painted, and they're all mashed together in incoherent tilesets so it's actually extremely distracting. The control system went from a simple but effective ""keyboard to move, mouse to aim"" system in [i]AVWW[/i] to a clunky and incoherent keyboard-only system. For a comparative example, let's say you want to shoot your magical ball-o'-death at some critter at an angle: [i]AVWW[/i], point and click. [i]AVWW2[/i], hold the right and up and fire keys at the same time and pray to whatever gods you have that you timed that perfect 45° angle shot just right because 45° angles are all you're going to be doing and also if you don't do the fire button at the right time then you're just going to jerkily leap your character up and into the target in a valiant but utterly stupid attempt to smash the enemy with her face. That's how [i]Archon[/i] worked back in the late 80s. It's as though the [i]AVWW2[/i] was coded for a particularly archaic D-pad setup. Everything about it is completely retrograde from the original.

It's completely unforgivable, since these people were able to make something competent, if not particularly impressive before. However, it's also unimaginably hilarious. It is so bad you just have to stop and laugh at everything.

And then just stop, since there's absolutely no point to go on any further with it.

There's certainly no point in actually spending money on the experience. | Listen.  I love this game.  It's one of a kind.  If you like metroidvania type games you should definitely check it out especially when it's only 2.99 right now on sale.  What makes it so unique compared to other games of the kind is that every level is a tile on the turn based strategy game portion, and what level you will want to do is going to be decided by what you need to be happening strategically.  

What makes the game such a fun challenge is that each tile has a difficulty percentage that can vary widely depending on different factors including what is happening in the strategy portion.  So, you might really need to open up a section of a map that's blocked by a tile with %500 difficulty level, but have fun with those crazy fast enemies and projectiles that knock off a third of your health, but hey, you gotta do what you gotta do.  Or, what if you can't make it through?  Time to rethink your strategy,  work on earning enough coins to hire mercenaries to open it up for you, tweak your character to go for speed over health, or or whatever else you can think of.  The world has it's own rules and mysteries and a lot of the fun is these things slowly becoming apparent to you as you play.

What I love about the game is all the variety in the side scrolling action and it's effect in making your strategy come together to win the game.  I think personally this game is tied with Red Faction Guerilla for most underrated, but this probably even more for all the hate it gets from people that can't look past its subpar graphics to see the amazing gameplay and feeling of being in a coherent world with its own inherent logic all coming together in a challenging and satisfying experience.  Just like other Arcen games there are lots of difficulty settings, I suggest you crank it up a bit. | Mezcla entre estrategia por turnos y Castlevania modernos (Metroidvanias), cosa que no se ha visto desde juegos como ActRaiser de Super Nintendo, muy fresco en este sentido.

Mais um joguinho de carrinhos de rádio controle, mas muito divertido e cheio de referências à outros jogos, personagens de desenhos animados e personagens da vida real, como o Senna. A mecânica do jogo já é conhecida e muito parecida com WRC Powerslide: Você controla a direção do carrinho com o analógico e acelera sem parar.

Uma vez que se acostume com os controles, nada de errado, a não ser pequenos bugs quando tem grandes subidas ou decidas. Acontece de às vezes você bater em algo invisível, mas é raro. 7/10

DIVERSÃO:
Garantida! Só poderia ser mais divertido ainda se houvessem mais power-ups como WRC Powerslide. O jogo vive de Nitros e Dinheiro, mais nada. Ainda assim, diversão garantida. 9/10

Fiquei jogando direto por 3 horas e ainda tenho vontade de jogar. | ☺ Easy to play.
☺ Lovely visuals.
☺ Brilliantly realised Portal and Team Fortress 2 maps.

☹ Unchallenging.
☹ Wonky physics.
☹ Drunk AI Drivers.

(Note: This game was played with a controller).

Mini Motor Racing EVO is a casual top down racer suitable for most ages, with easy to grasp controls and an aesthetic that greatly reminds me of playing with toy cars as a youngster.

While there is a decent selection of maps (and most notably the Portal and Team Fortress 2 maps are brilliantly realised), they quickly become repetitive as you play them again and again through the championships - in forward, reverse and with the camera on a slightly different angle (which is a surprisingly clever way of making the same track play a little differently). There is also an ingame editor linked to the Steam Workshop to create, share and download other tracks which is very simple to do.

While enjoyable to zip around the tracks and drift around corners, the AI opposition rarely put up any challenge at all (the exception being a couple of maps where you could do with a speed upgrade, that is easily passed the moment you have acquired it or a higher top speed vehicle). It also appears the AI Drivers have been drinking...while it's nice that they don't always perform the perfect lap, they will frequently slam into corners or boost directly into a wall.

The physics in the game can cause frustration, as you slap to a halt after performing a jump or snag on a slightly uphill piece of track.  There is also an oddity that before a race gets underway you get a glimpse of the tablet UI for the game, but that doesn't impact the experience in any meaningful way.

At the time of writing, there were no active multiplayer servers.

It's very hard to recommend Mini Motor Racing EVO except for the extremely casual gamer who's unfamiliar with racing titles and just wants a little fun zipping around a track. | If you can ignore the ease in which your little mini motor racing car can be spun out by competitors (and the massive clusters that this causes), and if you can get over the questional physics in a(n admittedly) minority of maps, then this game is a fantastic racer.

If you grab it while it's on sale for about $2.50, then the game is a fantastic addition to a gaming library. | Mini Motor Racing EVO has really become a very entertaining racing game.
It's a pleasure to race on the various tracks and the boost provides great help on the track.
The career mode is nicely expanded and every vehicle is worth re-challenging the racecourses!

Check out some gameplay here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQRm5M_G_kM | This is a cute little racer, reminiscent of the Amiga racer All Terrain Racing, that will hit both your pleasure and frustration buttons.  The two major frustrating elements are the collisions that almost always favour the AI racers, and also the lack of progress syncing in between races.  You'd better quit and restart on your own every few races to save your races and your money, because a game or a system crash will obliterate any progress from that session.

As for the game itself, it is a satisfying combination of good driving, tactics, and upgrades that will see you to the finish line.  You'll need more than just a couple of afternoons to make it to the end, and every time you make it past that one difficult course, it feels just great.  A worthwhile purchase if you like small, classic racers.",I need to say something else.

All you have to do is use Nitro off the starting block and the acceleration and handling will take care of the rest. If you don't, the whole pack will body you and you'll get stuck everywhere. It seems like only the leader really gets the bonus Nitro that spawns on the track.

I liked the different camera views, I mostly did top down but switched to behind view for the last series. I didn't like the player icon that hovers over the car in this view, pretty annoying. 

Races are basically 50 seconds. The handful of maps are nice, and I don't mind going in reverse, but at some point it starts to feel repetitive when the difficulty never gets any harder. At the same time, going for 100% didn't take ages. 

I think the only difference between this and Evo might be the weapons mode. I did just enough to get an achievement, otherwise I ignored it completely. Same with MP, you get splitscreen but the achievements are only for matchmaking.

В особенности порадовала локализация-то неправильная озвучка, то повторяются звуковые дорожки в совсем других репликах, затем порадовала оптимизация, каждый божий раз при запуске игра ставит разрешение в 2к, но у меня FULLHD, и приходится каждый раз снова менять, и это никак не чинится, второй прикол с PhysX-ставишь герцовку в 60 PhysX засыпает вместе с половиной освещения, ставишь 75 герц, и на тебе, всё снова работает. 4 раза игра вылетала за всё прохождение, но это норма для игр ПБ. Куча багов в квестах, когда диалоги с нужными персонажами просто не активны, особенно если это учители, но самое шикарное кроется в достижениях, 5 накопительных достижений, два на деньги и три на убийство монстров, за каждый двухчасовой сеанс я практически устраивал геноцид монстров по всем островам и собирал каждую мелочь на продажу, чтобы потом на 26 часу прохождения игры узнать что при каждом выходе из игры накопление тех или иных действий обнуляется к херам, спасибо папаша!

Германия в окружении, сражается из последних сил. Союзники с запада и Красная армия на востоке продолжают сжимать кольцо окружения Германии.

[h2]Сюжет:[/h2]
Элитный снайпер Карл Фейберн отправляется на своё последнее задание во Второй мировой войне-ликвидировать немецких учёных, разработавших ракеты Фау-2 (V2) и не допустить их запуск на Лондон, паралельно с этим, не дать учёным перейти на сторону русских.

[h2]Геймплей:[/h2]
Казалось бы, играешь за обычного снайпера. Бери винтовку, целься, стреляй. Однако, стоит поставить высокую сложность, как игра тут же преображается. Необходимо учитывать дыхание, сердцебиение; направление ветра, влияющее на полёт пули, также следует целится выше, т.к траектория пули снижается при полёте. Уровни здесь линейные, но имеющие множество путей прохождения. Можно сворачивать шеи врагам сзади, можно бесшумно стрелять из велрода. Отвлечь врага камнем, ставить ловушки, растяжки, мины для тяжёлой техники. Пользуясь шумом, можно замаскировать выстрел из снайперской винтовки. Главной фишкой всей серии Sniper Elite - это рентген-камера во время убийства; с каждой последующей частью она становилась лучше, масштабнее и эпичнее. Можно попасть в глаз, сердце, любую кость, а также в пах (да, Адольф?).

[h2]Музыка:[/h2]
Чего только стоит эпичный саундтрек, написанный композитором Марком Ратерфордом. Эти мелодии, одновременно отдающие дух неизбежного поражения Германии, так и приближения новой войны. Ну как же не упомянуть главную тему игры под названием ""Fatherland"", придающая крутости и брутальности всей франшизе.

Есть корпоративный режим ""Двойка"", где один игрок играет за снайпера и прикрывает наводчика. Сам наводчик в свою очередь выполняет диверсионные действия.

[h2]Итог:[/h2]
Sniper Elite V2 - это отличная игра не только про снайперский экшн, но и песочница, дающая игрокам вариативность прохождения. Такие игры откладываются в памяти игроков на долгое время. Тактика, экшн, отличный геймплей - всё это франшиза Sniper Elite.

El vínculo entre Lee y Clementine es la pieza fundamental  del juego, creando una de las historias más conmovedoras de todos los videojuegos que he probado.

    [*][b]Decisiones cruciales:[/b] Telltale logró que cada elección se sintiera importante. Desde diálogos tensos hasta momentos de vida o muerte, siempre estarás al borde de la incertidumbre. ¿A quién salvarás? ¿En quién confiarás?

    [*][b]Personajes que se sienten vivos:[/b] Cada personaje tiene personalidad, motivaciones y un papel en la historia. No todos estarán de acuerdo contigo, y algunos recordarán tus decisiones para bien o para mal. No es solo un juego de zombis, es un juego de personas.

Overview: ORION: Prelude is a first-person shooter and survival game developed by Spiral Game Studios. Set in a sci-fi universe, the game offers players the chance to fight off waves of enemies, mine for resources, and explore alien landscapes. As the ""Prelude"" in the title suggests, this is part of a larger series that focuses on cooperative survival and exploration. Players can engage in solo or multiplayer modes, with the game offering various environments and enemies to battle.

Gameplay: At its core, ORION: Prelude is a mix of survival, exploration, and action. The game features dynamic combat, where players fight off hordes of enemies with a variety of weapons and tools. Players can also mine resources to improve their weapons, build turrets, and upgrade their defenses.

The game supports both solo and multiplayer modes, with the co-op experience being a major highlight. In multiplayer, players can team up to face increasingly difficult waves of enemies. This cooperative play adds a layer of strategy, as players need to work together to survive the onslaught.

The combat itself is relatively standard for a first-person shooter, with a variety of weapons available, including guns, explosives, and melee tools. However, the AI can sometimes feel lackluster, and the enemy design doesn’t offer much variety or challenge in the long run.

Graphics and Performance: ORION: Prelude features fairly basic graphics for a modern first-person shooter. The environments are passable but not particularly impressive, with alien landscapes that can feel repetitive. The textures and character models are simple, and while they’re functional, they don't stand out visually. The game’s visual style is somewhat dated, even by the standards of games released around its time.

In terms of performance, ORION: Prelude runs decently on most systems, but it can struggle with optimization at times. Some players report frame rate drops or occasional stuttering, especially in more intense combat scenarios or when there are many enemies on screen. While the game isn't demanding on hardware, the performance can still be inconsistent, which may detract from the experience.

Audio Design: The audio in ORION: Prelude is serviceable but not remarkable. The sound effects for weapons, explosions, and enemies are decent but don’t have a strong impact. The soundtrack is fairly generic, with ambient sci-fi tunes that don’t add much to the atmosphere. While the audio isn't distracting, it doesn’t elevate the experience either. There’s no significant voice acting, which could have added personality and immersion to the game’s characters and story.

Challenges: ORION: Prelude offers a moderate challenge, especially in survival mode. As players progress through waves of enemies, the difficulty increases, requiring players to manage resources, defend positions, and upgrade their gear. However, the lack of diverse enemy types or complex AI behavior can make the game feel repetitive over time.

The game can become quite grindy, as players need to farm resources, mine, and continuously upgrade their weapons and defenses. While this can be fun for a while, it may begin to feel monotonous, especially if playing solo.

Final Thoughts: ORION: Prelude is an ambitious, yet somewhat flawed, survival shooter. While the cooperative gameplay and resource management offer some fun, the overall experience can feel repetitive and lacks the depth needed to keep players fully engaged. The game’s dated graphics, lack of enemy variety, and inconsistent performance hold it back from being a standout title in the genre.

Pros:

Fun cooperative multiplayer with friends
Resource management and upgrading add strategic elements
Some decent combat mechanics
Fairly easy to jump into for casual play
Cons:

Dated graphics and repetitive environments
Weak AI and lackluster enemy variety
Performance issues, including frame drops and stuttering
Lack of story or deep character development
Can become grindy and repetitive over time
ORION: Prelude offers a decent co-op survival experience but struggles to stand out in the crowded first-person shooter market. It’s enjoyable for short sessions with friends, but the lack of long-term depth and technical issues may prevent it from becoming a lasting favorite. | This is the cheapest way to have a blast on steam and its great when you have no internet because you can still play you defend a generator in ever increasing in difficulty dino waves with weapons you unlock yes there are vehicles like tanks bot and chopper and even a speed cycle | Worth every penny.

A Solid 9/10 and absolute classic. Have loved it since it first came out and now later in life. I just wish one issue technically/strategically/in terms of game design was fixed. If this was fixed the game would be perfect 10/10. 

As you build up your army organically against the King its population value can sometimes too drastically lower Rebel Sentiment to initiate the Revolution. So you could have towns that are in the high 90% of being pro Independence and being ready to go yet the Overall Score is stuck in the low 30%. This is completely lopsided and after I did everything right with the right buildings, founding fathers etc. 

In essence it's too much of a trade-off between growing your population/army along with maintaining the popularity needed to initiate the revolution. This SHOULD NOT BE A TRADE OFF! This catch 22 problem means you can't win the game as reasonably due to Strategy/Design Error. The best way to fix this is to remove Military Units from the calculation of Rebel Sentiment entirely. 

I have made comments on this issue in forms, on STEAM, along with others. Yet it doesn't seem to be fixed anytime soon. Sad given such a great game.",

Also this game has such a good PC port that I didn't even do a game configuration before going into the game. | Дивна річ ця пам’ять. У моїх спогадах, Психлікарня відповідала на 85% тому, що я побачив під час цього перепроходження, але враження та емоції були геть інші. Так вийшло, що перше знайомство відбулося з Arkham City, бо на той момент якраз була куплена нова відеокарта, а друг казав, що ця гра виглядає неймовірно й дуже вибаглива. Тож нереально приємно провівши час, десь за рік взявся за Asylum і по відчуттям, це було наче після Темного лицаря дивитися Бетмен: Початок. І те, і те – гарні фільмі, і те, і те – круті ігри, але коли вже побачив щось краще в тому ж усесвіті зі своїми правилами й механіками, початкові варіанти сприймаються звісно ж слабше. Проте, на момент написання рецензії, це відчуття недорозвинених ідей чи аспектів не повернулося, тому ще в першу ігрову сесію завершив проєкт на 33%, провівши з двома хвилинними перервами 7 годин.

Сюжет простий і зрозумілий, подиву викликати не має, хіба що в людей, які не знають хто такий Брюс Вейн. Починається все з того, що Джокер без проблем віддається в руки Бетмену й вони прямують у лікарню. Уже всередині закладу протагоніста не полишає думка, що це якийсь підступний план – звісно ж так і є. Поганець виривається на свободу й випускає різних суперзлочинців та хуліганів, які мають якомога довше затримувати Темного лицаря, щоб його супротивник міг утілювати свій підступний задум. Звісно ж під час проходження ми зустрінемо фан-сервіс… вибачте, усім знайомих ворогів – Страхопудала, Бейна, Плюща тощо. Я радий, що це відбулося, проте до них майже відсутнє якесь сценарне підведення (окрім Бейна, хіба що): вони виникають на нашому шляху й хочуть надавати кажану по вухах. Якщо перемішати їх місцями, зміни будуть незначні, а для загального бачення картини взагалі відсутні. Фінал теж доволі посередній, а порівнювати з Arkham City взагалі не варто – там у мене відвисла щелепа, а тут непоганий мордобій і все: відчуття наче це кінець сезону, а далі буде наступний.

Стосовно мордобою. Я не цікавився чи це оригінальна ідея, чи десь підгледіли, але саме в серії Arkham я вперше побачив цю систему вибивання всього лaйнa із супротивників. Першу серію ударів Бетмен робить звичайні, а на кожний наступний удар нокаутує ворога на короткий проміжок часу, а гравцю треба лише вчасно тиснути удар, щоб протагоніст з певною анімацією сам підлітав до найближчої пики в напрямку камери – виглядає досі бомбезно й спроби повторити так і не перевершили Rocksteady Studios. Є ухилення в сторону чи через когось, але повністю відсутній блок, тому для вдалого перехоплення атаки треба в таймінг тиснути контрудар – інакше комбо буде збито, а наш герой отримає шкоду. Може на словах це якась 2-3-кнопочна боївка (що так і є, хе-хе), але на практиці купа поганців може швидко обламати кажану крильця, не кажучи вже про те, як круто виглядає битва без пропущених ударів. До речі, на високій складності, яку я вибрав, над головою хуліганів відсутній індикатор, тому треба самому уважно дивитися хто коли б’є.

Щодо іншого ігрового процесу, то це метроїдванія без необхідності в примусовому порядку йти в попередні локації та потрапляти в раніше закриті зони через відсутність певних ґаджетів. Окрім декодера, для якого Бетмен використав спеціальну картку, трохи дивно спостерігати за тим, як він свої ж інструменти не носить із собою, а бере тільки в певний момент. Деякі, як от подвійний бетаранг, можна отримати лише в меню прокачки. За різні дії, знаходження секретів, набивання великих комбо видають досвід, який підвищує рівень. За кожний можна вибрати будь-яке одне відкрите покращення: асортимент невеликий, це або посилення фізичних ударів і збільшення здоров’я, чи просто розширення можливостей вищезгаданих ґаджетів, що загалом не є необхідним по сюжету, а слугує задля колекціонування.

Так, ніхто нікого не змушує кудись там іти, але ж самому хочеться, і це великий плюс. Територія лікарні невелика, але в різних закутках і не дуже знаходяться аудіозаписи сеансів з місцевими пацієнтами, що складає певне враження про їхній характер чи хід думок. На локаціях можна знайти купу щелеп Джокера, які направляють гравця на основний шлях: їх знищення дає досвід і відкриває загадки Ріддлера (я його буду так звати, бо український варіант – Загадник – мені якось не до вподоби). Окрім цього, він розкидав фігурки знаків питання, більшість з яких потребує саме прокачаних ґаджетів. Звісно ж не обійшлося без загадок: у більшості кімнат треба знайти щось, що є відповіддю на них. Для цього необхідно використати унікальну механіку детектива: Бетмен починає бачити все навколо в рентгені з підсвідкою об’єктів та інформацією щодо оточення; якщо затиснути клавішу, то відбувається аналіз, а при влучному наведенні – загадка відмічається як розгадана. Усього їх 240, тому вистачить усім. У нагороду відкриються спеціальні випробування та моделі персонажів у головному меню.

Повертаючись до вражень. У ті часи я грав як є, головне, щоб був текстовий переклад, а якщо в меню не можна було змінити озвучення, то я не шукав способів зробити це інакше. Але, Asylum була після City, тому мені не вистачало тих самих голосів. А на озвучення трьох головних ролей тут узяли найкращих – голоси з мультсеріалу 1992-1995 рр, які не тільки для мене є ідеальними для своїх персонажів – Кевін Конрой у ролі Бетмена, Марк Гемміл у ролі Джокера, Арілін Соркін у ролі Гарлі Квінн. Ніякий Крістіан Бейл, Гіт Леджер, Марґо Роббі їм не рівня. Комісара Ґордона озвучує Том Кейн, який теж професіонал, але трохи не той Джим, якого голосом грав Боб Гейстінгз, проте й роль тут невелика. Відчутним мінусом є сама якість цих реплік: на тлі чіткого саундтреку, фрази звучать так, наче звук стиснено заради економії місця; гадаю десь на студії лежать оригінали, але їх ми ніколи не почуємо, якщо не випустять раптовий ремастер, як це сталося з Quake II, де нам надали можливість грати з lossless-треками.

Щодо технологічної частини, то тут усе складно. З однієї сторони гра 2009 року, тому очікувати щось не варто, але з іншої, того ж року вийшла Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, що тоді було просто «вау». Ще можна згадати м’ясну Prototype, Assassin's Creed II з деталізованим оточенням, Left 4 Dead 2 з гарними анімаціями облич, Red Faction: Guerrilla з проривною фізикою. Загалом, Бетмен погано зберігся: текстури страшнуваті, персонажі просто відкривають рот з мертвим виразом обличчя, модельки якісь трохи широкі й непропорційні, купа дверей з підвантаженням, пререндерені ролики низької якості, загальне відчуття низької частоти кадрів через анімації руху, зроблені з низьким fps, шрифти субтитрів не масштабуються після Full HD тощо. Тому рекомендую [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1159691355/][b]цей посібник[/b][/url]. 

У моєму профілі можна подивитися скріншоти як виглядатиме. Я встановлював Asylum Reborn, який іде одразу з оновленим лаунчером; AsylumHD та Asylum 4K. Що це дає? Текстури на всіх поверхнях і моделях матимуть якісний оновлений вигляд та разом з катсценами будуть у 4k. Покращений запускач дасть змогу без проблем вибрати будь-яку роздільну здатність і надасть доступ до недоступних у стандартній версії параметрів, включно з тими, які активують моди. Вбудована технологія NVIDIA PhysX працюватиме належним чином і в повну силу, що не тільки надасть фізичну модель кожному папірцю в частих стосах, але й усі цеглини чи інші предмети взіємодіятимуть з моделями: особливо круто на вулиці ходити й розкидувати листя на підлозі. Єдине місце, де всі ці покращення можуть навантажити систему, це сутичка зі Страхопудалом, де на екрані сотні маленьких об’єктів, що лікується сучасним залізом або середніми налаштуваннями PhysX.

Thank you for the game. | The characters are funny but the dialogue in this game is definitely not for anyone under the age of 18 (UK) .

It helps to have a good notion of the something like dungeons and dragons/hobbit/warcraft for the humour.
A bonus humour point for the ability to throw the goblin during the fights as a missile attack for the orc. 

The game-play, itself, is predominantly a classic hack-n-slash dungeon crawler with a fight lurking around each corner.  Some of the fights are fairly severe, even when playing on easy mode.
I still haven't worked out how to kill more than 5 opponents without dying, maybe the skill points aren't set in the correct stats, who knows.

The story line and the selection of possible answers with the npc chats are very reminiscent of the old-style point and click RPGs, which is why most of us probably like it.

A major problem that people might find, is that the graphics and game engines are specifically with nVidia style cards in mind (originally I tried to play this a few years ago when it was first released but discovered my nVidia chipset wasn't latest/greatest enough for the game).  Not quite sure why they do that.  I also doubt that this will run under linux or a vm directly.  Currently running this on an AMD Ryzen 7 with a GeForce RTX3050 and it has no audio or graphics glitches.

For Dr. X, it's more than just a clever invention, but his entire livelihood being taken away by a mega corporation, framing and imprisoning him in the process just to make it abundantly clear what a bunch of greedy pricks they are. Unfortunately, they forgot about a little virus named Tom, who's about to turn their billion dollar company into a pile of rubble, one computer at a time.

A Virus Named Tom is something like a pimped out Pipe Mania. Guiding Tom through computer mainframes, you need to redirect the flow of the hack by twisting panels until the infection has spread across the entire board. Simple in theory, but in execution it becomes quite an elaborate challenge once anti-hack bugs, hidden and unmovable tiles, and the intricate maze designs start to pile on more and more things to keep track of. One of the most impressive things about AVNT is how it balances these elements into a gradual but brisk increase in difficulty. Rarely did I feel overwhelmed by any of the mechanics, instead rather impressed with myself that I was able to solve what initially appear to be incredibly involved puzzles. It's constantly rewarding and satisfying to progress, even with the surprisingly long single player story (which doesn't take into account the entire separate coop campaign which I've yet to even dip into).

As a puzzle game, A Virus Named Tom resides pleasantly in the realm of the best pick up and play arcade classics. It's challenging and enjoyable whether in short bursts or drawn out sessions as you try to attain a gold medal on every level, and never once managed to outstay its welcome for me however long I spent with it. It also features a fantastic electronic soundtrack, and some rather charming and humorous cutscenes which somehow manage to make mass hysteria and deconstruction feel lighthearted and amusing. Really, if a game can't sell itself to you with a dog that doesn't poop, I don't even know what more there is to say. | Imagine the hacking minigame from Bioshock, except that you rotate existing tiles instead of placing existing ones. Also imagine that you control Frogger, who hand-rotates these tiles while listening to techno and dodging traffic on a highway.

If you dismiss indie games as being EITHER fast, tough-as-nails platformers OR artsy atmospheric environments, I highly encourage you to give this game a shot - this is a fine example of original gameplay that requires split-second precision and risk/reward decision making. I had beaten (not gold-medalled) the single-player campaign in about 4 hours, but don't take that as a knock against the game - I preferred to play in 10-minute intervals to give my nerves a chance to recover from the frantic pace, and I haven't played much of the other modes yet.

The soundtrack by Ian Hicks is extremely well done - 7 tracks that nicely complement the setting and gameplay that are well worth purchasing and adding to your mp3 player. The 8th, which is used in the trailer, feels out of place and I've removed it from my playlist. Recommended.

Speed and precision required: Yes

Straightforward 100%: No

Soundtrack format: DLC, mp3 | A Virus Named TOM is not a bad game, but the game mechanics and controls don't make this all that fun to play. It really needs a more intuitive method to rotate blocks maybe by using the left/right triggers or bumpers. | A cyber-thief system hack simulator , TOM is reminisce of a ingenious virus that can bypass the most secure infrastructures. Enough said, this game throws you into a world of around 60 puzzles distributed across 6 chapters with the intent of spreading TOM named malware and continue infecting every level. The real-world security crypto techniques are used as reference such as firewall, encryption, drone, man in middle, glitch. More than just your sharp acumen for puzzles, you need to be quick with keys and Real-Time-Events. A lot of puzzles get increasingly difficult when lot of advanced virus trackers tries to intersect at a flank speed making it harder for you to proceed even by cell and configure the arrangement to spread your malware. After all, this game is trying to prove your mettle for hacking.

Ever wanted to let that bad samaritan out and anonymously feel how it is like being a top-notch cyber thief, the TOM virus invention by Dr. X, is your safe haven. Get your hoodie on and use the virus to create mayhem. | This was a great modern and unique twist on Pipe Dream, any real old arcade fans should love it.

I played this with my brother in co-op and we beat the game in a couple days just plowing through it. It was challenging but really enjoyable and intense with all of the creative obsticles you have to deal with, including eachother.

Liked the music so much, decided to save it to winamp so its always in my collection. It suits the game well, with upbeat techno. The art is simplistic but gets the job done, everything visually is clear so the only one to blame for failing is yourself, there's no cheap deaths in this game.

The versus mode is kind of strange, a bit like bomberman but not really something to keep coming back to. The only thing the game is missing to me was an online mode, but we still managed to beat the game in local multiplayer before he had to catch his flight.","A Virus Named Tom is a surprisingly good puzzle game, and it's a good one."

Publisher: So, you have a wild mafia-themed point-and-click adventure game for me?

Game Designer: Yes, sir, I do! It's called Sam & Max: The Mole, the Mob, and the Meatball. Sam and Max, the freelance police, get caught up in a ridiculous mafia plot, trying to find a mole while dealing with a missing meatball sandwich. But oh, it’s much bigger than that. They end up infiltrating the Toy Mafia, causing chaos everywhere they go!

Publisher: A meatball sandwich is the focus of this mafia plot?

Game Designer: Oh, absolutely. It’s the most important thing in the whole episode! Someone stole the famous sandwich from the casino, and Sam and Max need to track it down—or else.

Publisher: Right. So, there’s a missing sandwich, and that somehow involves the mafia?

Game Designer: You bet! But there’s also so much more going on. Sam and Max are trying to track down this mole in the Toy Mafia by doing jobs for them. Like, killing Sybil, faking her death, and getting hypnotic bears into Bosco’s store. But—plot twist—they also have to track down this sandwich, and it's critical to the whole mission.

Publisher: Right, right. So there’s a sandwich, a mafia, and a couple of freelancing cartoon cops?

Game Designer: Exactly! And lots of crazy characters! You got Bosco, who’s paranoid about the Toy Mafia, and Leonard Steakcharmer, a casino cheater who’s cheating his way to 10 million casino tokens. Oh, and there’s a spy tool called “The Bug” that they use to eavesdrop on people.

Publisher: The Bug? How does that work?

Game Designer: Oh, you know, it’s just a device that records conversations and then replays them. It’s like a gadget out of a spy movie, but with a lot more cartoon nonsense.

Publisher: Okay, okay, I’m following. And these jobs for the mafia... What are they?

Game Designer: Well, they need to take out Sybil—but it’s not what you think—they fake her death using ketchup. And then there’s the whole situation with the hypnotic bears. They need to deliver them to Bosco’s store. The mafia’s a mess, and Sam and Max have to play both sides to survive!

Publisher: Hypnotic bears? Faking deaths with ketchup? I’m not sure this is what I imagined when you said “mafia game.”

Game Designer: Oh, but it works! The comedy is so over-the-top. Sam and Max don’t know what they’re doing half the time, which just makes everything funnier. They’re the worst mafia henchmen, but they somehow still get the job done—barely.

Publisher: Okay, but how do they infiltrate the mafia?

Game Designer: Easy! They get into the mafia by doing jobs for them. They’re hired as assassins, then take on some ridiculous missions. And then, surprise, they get inducted into the mafia by completing all the tasks. But it’s not easy—no one trusts them. And then there’s the mole! The mole’s working for the mafia!

Publisher: The mole?

Game Designer: Yeah, Ted E. Bear! But guess what? He’s actually a mole-man! The twist is that he was sent by the police to infiltrate the mafia, but instead, he becomes the mafia boss.

Publisher: So the mole infiltrates the mafia, becomes the mafia boss, and then tries to hypnotize Sam and Max?

Game Designer: Exactly! And they’re immune to his hypnosis, but they fake Max’s death to trick him anyway. Classic Sam & Max!

Publisher: Alright, that’s wild. But what happens at the end?

Game Designer: Oh, it’s huge! They defeat Ted E. Bear, blow up the toy factory, and finally get the mole—but the meatball sandwich is still gone. It’s a real cliffhanger.

Publisher: Wait, wait. You never find the meatball sandwich?

Game Designer: Nope! It’s a running mystery. Sam and Max just leave it as this unresolved joke.

Publisher: Oh, I like that. But listen, I gotta ask: Is there anything else I should know about the game? Anything extra?

Game Designer: Well, yeah! There’s the Toy Mafia’s headquarters, a giant toy factory, and some absolutely absurd interactions. Oh, and Sam and Max might blow up the toy factory by the end of it! It’s like... it’s like if you took a mafia film, added in cartoons, a sandwich, and, like, a lot of chaos.

Publisher: Okay, I’m in. It’s ridiculous enough to work. So, what’s next?

Game Designer: Well, I’m thinking merchandising, right? We make the meatball sandwich a real item. I mean, who wouldn’t want that?!

Publisher: You’re right. I’m sold.

[Suddenly, the door bursts open, and Tony Soprano, Fat Tony, and Don Corleone enter.]

Tony Soprano: Hey, what’s all this about a meatball sandwich?

Fat Tony: I’m listenin’... and I gotta say, I like what you’re doin’. But we gotta talk about this whole mafia thing. You got the right people here, you know?

Don Corleone: You want to make them an offer they can’t refuse, eh?

Game Designer: Uh, what are you doing here?!

Publisher: Oh no, not this again.

Tony Soprano: You’re gonna need some muscle for that meatball sandwich, huh? We can help with that.

Fat Tony: Yeah, we got people who handle sandwiches. People who don’t just let them go missing.

Don Corleone: I’ll make them an offer... a sandwich offer. They won’t be able to refuse.

Publisher: Guys, this is a game pitch, not a mob deal!

Game Designer: Yeah! I’m just trying to get the game greenlit here!

Tony Soprano: Listen, listen. We’re here to talk sandwiches and business. You need our help, capisce?

Fat Tony: Maybe throw in a little meatball connection, and we can talk. Business is business, after all.

Don Corleone: You should have come to us sooner, but we’ll take care of it.

Mr. T:
Ain’t no time for no games, fool! But you know what? I got somethin’ that I gotta talk about. Reality 2.0.

[Mr. T takes a deep breath, staring at the screen like it’s the most ridiculous thing he’s ever seen.]

Mr. T:
You know, I gotta admit, this whole virtual world thing is getting on my nerves. You got people all hooked into these Reality 2.0 goggles like they’re a new kind of drug.

Mr. T:
Fool, you can’t defeat me. You think you can lock me in some digital space? Nah. I got the key to the real world. Let me tell you something. I am the only thing in here that’s real, and when I hit you with this handkerchief full of germs, you’re going down harder than my gold chains when I take ‘em off at the end of the day.

Shakespeare:
Nay, I call thee fool not as an insult, but as a reflection of thine ignorance to the way of games and virtual worlds!

Mr. T:
You know what? I pity the fool who thinks they can outwit me in a game, and it’s lookin’ like you’re that fool!

Shakespeare:
I pity thy fool! Forsooth, thy game is but a shadow! The only Reali-T that shall endure is the one that hath substance in the heart, not in pixels.

Mr. T:
Oh, snap! You got that right, fool. It’s all about the heart. And my heart? Well, it beats for Reali-T, and that means keeping it real. No more virtual nonsense.

[The game continues, but Mr. T now delivers a dramatic finishing blow to ""The Internet.""]

Mr. T:
See? That’s how you shut down a fake reality. Mr. T’s Reali-T—now that’s the only thing you need, Shakespeare, you hear me? No more tricks. No more fake worlds. Just gold chains, muscles, and the best of what’s real.

Shakespeare:

Walter White: (leaning in with a steely focus, fingers poised over the controller) ""Alright, Jesse. This isn’t just some game. This is calculation, precision. Sam and Max? They're the perfect example of how chaos and order can coexist. I’m Sam—orderly, strategic, the one who calls the shots. You’re Max, pure unpredictability. It's how we make it work, Jesse.""

Jesse Pinkman: (snickers) ""Yo, I’m Max? Hell yeah! You’re right, man—I’m the freakin’ chaos in this world. Max is like me: all about blowin' up the system. This is like some Pink Floyd kind of trip, right? Man, I’m ready to kick some ass, just like I’m breaking bad on these fools!""

Walter White: (gritting his teeth, half-smiling) ""You know, Jesse, I don’t think you quite get it. Sam doesn’t go off the rails like you do. He’s in control. He keeps the system in check, unlike... some people."" (glances at Jesse)

Jesse Pinkman: (flopping onto the couch) ""Yeah, well, I don’t need no rules, yo. That’s what makes Max awesome. He’s the one who’s, like, breaking everything down! You feel me? Like—BOOM! Max is breaking bad on the moon right now!""

Walter White: (nodding in approval) ""Alright, Jesse. Let’s see if your version of chaos holds up. I’ll take Sam. I am the danger here, Jesse. While you’re busy causing a scene as Max, I’ll be making the real moves.""

[The game begins. The opening cutscene shows Sam and Max driving the DeSoto to the moon. Walter controls Sam, walking with calculated movements, while Jesse’s Max is bouncing around, causing chaos.]

Jesse Pinkman: (laughing) ""Yo, look at Max go! He’s like a damn wrecking ball, smashing everything in his path! This is what it’s like when you don’t give a damn about rules! I'm like Max, dude—I’m not here to make friends, I’m here to make an impact!""

Walter White: (staring intently at the screen) ""Jesse, you’re a mess. Sam is the one who doesn’t need to rely on impulses. He has a plan—just like me. There’s no alchemy in chaos, Jesse. We work with what we have and make it work. Remember when I told you, 'Say my name'? It’s all about making people respect your power."" (Sam gives a sharp, authoritative look.)

Jesse Pinkman: (grinning) ""Yeah, yeah—I am the one who knocks, Mr. White. Max is the one who knocks out everyone in this game. Who needs a plan when you’ve got punches like this?"" (Max starts throwing wild punches in the game.)

[They reach the part where they must deal with Max’s personified vices: gluttony, sloth, and violence. Jesse, thoroughly entertained, is already ramped up.]

Jesse Pinkman: ""Yo, dude—look at this! Max’s vices, right? Gluttony, sloth, violence. Man, I’m like—ALL OF THEM! Ha! I’m a glutton for chaos! This is my world! Just like when I said, ‘Yeah, science!’ It’s my version of science, man!""

Walter White: (serious tone) ""You know, Jesse, sometimes—just sometimes—you gotta know when to embrace the chaos. But don’t mistake chaos for a lack of control. Control is everything. And when I say 'I am the one who knocks,' I’m talking about controlling everything in my sight. You’re just... swinging blindly. Sam knows where he’s going, Jesse.""

Jesse Pinkman: ""Yo, Sam’s cool, I get it. But Max is the one who’s making moves and not worrying about the fallout. It’s like when I told you: I don’t have to listen to your crap anymore. I'm about action—Max style!""

[The game continues, with Jesse's Max causing mayhem and Walter’s Sam working through puzzles methodically. Finally, they reach the epic confrontation with Hugh Bliss, the villain who has hypnotized everyone into seeing the world through his trippy prism.]

Walter White: (gripping the controller tightly) ""Jesse, this is it. We’re facing the mastermind, Hugh Bliss. A man who’s trying to control reality itself. Do you understand, Jesse? He’s just like... like every competitor I’ve had in the meth business. He wants to manipulate the world into seeing things his way. But not on my watch. We don’t let chaos win. We control it.""

Jesse Pinkman: (snickers) ""Control? Nah, man, Hugh Bliss is like that whacko weasel trying to mess with the system. But Max? Max is about blowing it all up. You can’t control everything, man, and that’s the lesson you gotta learn! Sometimes you gotta just let it burn! Like I told you, 'Yeah, Mr. White, I get it.' I’m ready to take this dude down like a meth lab explosion, yo!""

Walter White: (gritting his teeth, voice low) ""There’s no breaking bad here, Jesse. I’m not just making moves, I’m making decisions. You want to destroy everything? I’m going to solve this with precision."" (Sam shoots the final shot.)

[The moment comes. The final battle ensues. Max is throwing punches left and right, while Sam is calculating his next move to stop Hugh Bliss once and for all.]

Jesse Pinkman: ""Ha! Max just kicked some serious butt! Just like when I said, ‘Say my name—Max, the king of chaos!’ I’m the one who knocks, and that’s how it’s done! Hell yeah, man!""

Walter White: (smiling slightly) ""I have to admit, Jesse. You were right about one thing. Maybe chaos can win. But, let me be clear, Jesse—I control the chaos. I make it work for me.""

Jesse Pinkman: ""Yeah, yeah—whatever, Mr. White. But I’m still the one who makes the crazy moves. I break bad, you just break even.""

Walter White: (with a small chuckle) ""You know, Jesse, maybe the world is a little darker than we thought. But sometimes, you have to let the chaos unfold, just like Pink Floyd said: ‘We’re just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl’—but we still make it out alive.""

Jesse Pinkman: (raising his arms triumphantly) ""Yo, you just got all philosophical on me, Mr. White! Hell yeah! I’m gonna go break more stuff, Max-style!""

Walter White: (with a rare grin) ""Let’s just hope you don’t break anything else, Jesse. The last time we did that... well, we all remember how that turned out.""

[The game credits roll, and the two sit back. The RV is quiet, but for the faint hum of the air conditioner. Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon can be heard playing in the background as Walter and Jesse continue to banter about the game, both clearly enjoying the bizarre adventure they’ve just completed.]

Jesse Pinkman: ""Dude, that was a trip. Max is the man. Sam’s cool, but Max is breaking bad all the way. Next time, we’re going harder. You feel me?""

Walter White: (leaning back in his chair) ""I’m beginning to think I might just let you handle the chaos for once, Jesse. But don’t get used to it.""

Jesse Pinkman: ""Yeah, yeah. Whatever, man. You know what they say: ‘I am the danger.’ And Max is the one who’s always causing it.""

[Fade to black, with Pink Floyd’s iconic Time playing softly in the background.]

76561197970698176,8260,Sam & Max 201: Ice Station Santa,0.0,Adventure,0,"Très bon début de saison avec cet épisode de Noël très amusant. On retrouve des personnages connus, et Stinky fait son arrivée. La durée de vie est un peu augmentée par rapport à la première saison. Un épisode très réussi ! |  [h1]Title: Futurama Cast Plays ""Ice Station Santa"")[/h1]

Scene: The Planet Express crew—Fry, Leela, Bender, Zoidberg, Amy, Hermes, and Farnsworth—are gathered in the lounge of the Planet Express ship, playing Sam & Max: Beyond Time and Space, Episode 1: Ice Station Santa. The room is filled with snacks, drinks, and a mix of excitement and confusion as they get into the game.

Fry: (Holding the controller, squinting at the screen) Uh, okay, so we’re in the North Pole, and Santa’s shooting at people. Did I miss something? I thought Santa was supposed to, like, give out presents or something.

Leela: (Rolls her eye) That’s what you think. It’s Sam & Max, Fry. Nothing makes sense. Just go with it.

Bender: (Leans back in his chair, sipping a beer) Yeah, Fry, try thinking with your brain for once. It’s just Santa going rogue. He probably saw an Amazon package and lost it.

Amy: (Leaning in, curious) Wait, wait, wait. Santa’s possessed by a demon? And now we need to fix Christmas... with action figures? This is like if Futurama had a crossover with The Twilight Zone.

Fry: I’m just here for the robot explosions. (He eagerly presses a button on the controller)

Bender: (Nods approvingly) Now that’s the spirit, meatbag. Who needs to worry about plot when you’ve got explosions and ridiculousness?

Zoidberg: (Leaping out of his seat, flailing his claws) Aha! So it’s not just about presents, but about saving Christmas? I love Christmas! But I mostly love the presents... and the food. I bet there’s a Christmas feast waiting for us after we vanquish the demon!

Amy: (Skeptical) Zoidberg, don’t get your hopes up. This game doesn’t seem like it’s about food. It’s more about the absurdity. Like, why are the elves hiding from Santa? And why are we solving all of this with action figures?

Leela: (Shrugs) It’s Sam & Max, Amy. That’s just how it works. There’s no rhyme or reason. One minute you’re fighting a giant robot that’s been sent by Santa, the next minute you're talking to spirits and trying to fix Christmas in three different time periods. It’s like someone crammed every bizarre idea into a blender and hit ""Puree.""

Fry: (Leans forward, clearly invested) Okay, but why are we using The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse action figures to summon a demon? That’s—wait for it—hilarious.

Bender: (Snickers) You know what I think? I think the real Horsemen of the Apocalypse are going to be awesome. Just picture it: one’s got a sickle, another’s got a giant scythe, and the third one probably does taxes or whatever. Maybe I can be one of them!

Zoidberg: (Picks up a snack, tossing it in the air and catching it) Mmmm... I think they’re all based on some obscure ancient ritual that’s very serious, Fry. (Notices everyone staring at him) You’re not buying that, are you? Fine, fine, it’s just ridiculous.

Amy: (Watching intently as Sam and Max perform the ritual) Oh great. Now we’re summoning the Spirits of Christmas. Past, Present, and Future? This is starting to sound like a Christmas Carol... with action figures and a demon. (Laughs) This is awesome.

Fry: (Chuckling) Yeah, so now we need to make Christmas right in the past. Oh, wait—here’s the best part: We’re fixing a Christmas we totally ruined! I can’t wait to mess up some history! I’m basically Captain Time Travel.

Bender: (Laughing) So the holiday’s all about cookies? Wow. Screw that. I’m in it for the candy canes. They’re like candy... but sharper.

Zoidberg: (Suddenly serious) And don’t forget about the demon Jell-o! That’s what’s going to save Christmas. (Pause) But mostly the shrimp.

Amy: (Sighs in disbelief) Okay, okay, I’m in. This is so weird that it’s brilliant.

Leela: (Nods) Exactly. It’s so ridiculous that it works. We’re in a North Pole nightmare, fixing time travel, summoning spirits, and trying to send a possessed Santa back to Satan.

Bender: (Flipping through a magazine) And don’t forget, at the end of the day, Santa’s still an idiot. What a meatbag. But hey, at least he got to eat the demon Jell-o. That’s a win in my book.

Fry: (Pauses dramatically) Wait, so we’re done now? Do we... save Christmas or what?

Leela: (Smiling wryly) No, Fry. You ruined Christmas. Now you’ll just have to... live with it.

Bender: (Picks up a bottle and chugs it) Oh, I’ll live with it. And then I’ll drink to it, because Sam & Max may be the most insane thing I've ever seen. And I’ve seen a lot.

Enter Hermes and Professor Farnsworth.

Hermes: (Folding his arms) I don't know what kind of foolishness you're all involved in, but let me tell you, Sam & Max is about as organized as my tax returns after a five-day vacation in Jamaica! Santa’s possessed, demons are popping up like bad reviews, and you’re using action figures to fix it?! Ridiculous, man! Ridiculous!

Bender: (Throws up his hands dramatically) Ah, come on, Hermes, lighten up! This is fantastic! It’s got everything—chaos, absurdity, a possessed Santa... and demon Jell-o! What's not to love?

Hermes: (Points to the screen, furious) I’ll tell you what’s not to love: this is exactly why we’re all on the express train to messed-up-ville! You’re playing games while your paperwork is backing up, and I got enough work to fill a mountain of forms! Who’s going to file the tax reports for Santa’s demon-summoning shenanigans, huh?

Farnsworth: (Cackling from the corner, adjusting his glasses) Ho ho ho—this is truly magnificent! The spirit of Christmas is dying, and they’re fixing it with action figures! (Leans in, eyes gleaming) I love it!

Hermes: (Groaning) Not you too, Professor! You’re a man of science! You should be analyzing the logical inconsistencies in this... in this... nonsense!

Farnsworth: (Ignoring Hermes) Oh, but you see, Hermes, there’s a beautiful logic to all of it! The only way to fix this fractured holiday is with absurdity and irreverence! If anything, this game is an expression of pure scientific theory—craziness creates balance! If we can’t fix Christmas with spiritual rituals and action figures, what hope does the world have?!

Bender: (Puffs out his chest) See? Even Farnsworth gets it, Hermes! You’re just mad you didn’t think of using action figures to summon demons first. That’s the true spirit of Christmas!

Hermes: (Throws his hands up) You know what? Forget it! I’m filing my taxes, then I’m getting drunk.

Fry: (Pause as he’s focused on the screen) So, uh, now we have to bring out the three Spirits of Christmas, but we have to fix past Christmases where we messed up. I’m excited. This is like time travel... but with less effort!

Bender: (Laughing loudly) Time travel? Bah! Who needs that? It’s just a reason to mess with history! (He smirks) Why not just change the future to get some extra credits? Oh wait, that's right—I already do that.

Zoidberg: (Frantically running in circles) I’m gonna fix Christmas! I’m gonna fix it! I’m going to save everyone from the demon, and then I’ll feast! (Pauses dramatically, looking around for something to eat) And probably I'll get a nice Christmas ham. Or shrimp... lots of shrimp.

Farnsworth: (Excitedly) Oh, dear boy, you don't fix Christmas with shrimp! You do it with chaos and a few demons! More importantly, we’re creating chaos and rituals by the second! I’m going to write a paper on this... a very important paper!

Amy: (Raising an eyebrow) So… are we actually going to finish this game, or just talk about it forever?

Bender: (Looking at the controller, grinning) Oh, we’re going to finish this game. But let’s take a detour and mess with a few more holiday traditions while we’re at it. It’s Christmas, after all!

The screen fades out to the Sam & Max credits as the crew continues to argue, play, and laugh.

THE END. | Great Christmas Game!
",A very good episode of Futurama.

Certaines énigmes peuvent donner du fil à retordre, mais Max vous donnera des indices bienvenus si vous tournez en rond trop longtemps. Toujours très plaisant et drôle. | [h1]Honest Game Trailer for Sam & Max: Moai Better Blues — Featuring a Malkavian Vampire[/h1]

(Dramatic music. The camera zooms in on the title card for Sam & Max: Moai Better Blues. The screen flickers, then a sinister voice over takes over.)

Narrator (deep, gravelly voice):
In a world where logic is optional... and basic principles of physics are definitely optional... a new adventure awaits.

(A bright flash of light fills the screen as Sam & Max rush to the Bermuda Triangle portal. Suddenly, a Malkavian vampire from Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines appears, twitching and muttering to himself.)

Malkavian Vampire (wild-eyed, dramatic):
The symbols! They're all connected! The Bermuda Triangle! The Moai heads! The stop sign! It's a conspiracy, you fools! A cosmic prophecy unfolding before our eyes!

(Sam and Max glance at him briefly, completely unfazed. Sam scratches his chin.)

Sam (nonchalantly):
What, another one? Max, I think we’ve got a new friend.

Max (grinning):
He’s cute. I’m starting to think we should have a Malkavian in every adventure. They really liven things up!

(The Malkavian stares at a stop sign, his eyes widening in terror.)

Malkavian Vampire (screaming):
It’s a symbol! A symbol of the END! IT’S COMING FOR US, YOU CAN’T ESCAPE THE SIGN!

Narrator (snarky):
Oh, that’s right. Sam & Max: Moai Better Blues. The second episode of Sam & Max: Beyond Time and Space, where every plot thread is as twisted and nonsensical as a conspiracy theorist’s notebook... except it’s way more fun, and significantly weirder.

(Cut to Sam and Max in front of the triangular portal. Max gleefully grabs a stop sign, while Sam just looks at it with indifference.)

Narrator (mocking):
*In this episode, things start simple enough—until a triangular portal starts chasing your friend Sybil. But don’t worry! A red octagon is the only thing that can stop it! No, I’m not making that up. This game literally asks you to deal with the greatest puzzle of all time: stop signs. Because logic? Nah, we don’t need that here.

(The Malkavian vampire, in full panic mode, points at the stop sign and gasps.)

Malkavian Vampire (yelling wildly):
IT'S THE END OF THE LINE!! THE STOP SIGN IS THE KEY! THE FINAL PIECE!

Sam (shrugs):
Well, guess we’ll just take it down, Max.

Max (gleeful):
Perfect! We’ll show the universe who’s boss!

(Sam nonchalantly destroys the stop sign with a single tap. The Malkavian stares at it in horror, then collapses into a dramatic faint.)

Narrator (dry):
Then, after all that stop sign drama, you’re going to find yourselves hopping through a Bermuda Triangle, onto the mystical island of Easter Island. Home to the Moai heads, an ancient prophecy, and a volcano that’s really angry.

(Cut to the Moai heads dramatically proclaiming the prophecy in a slow, operatic tone.)

Moai Head (deep voice, serious):
The volcano will rise! And the lava will swallow us whole! The prophecy has foretold it!

Max (looking bored):
Sure, sure, we’ve heard it all before. You’re about to be burned alive, blah blah blah. Let’s just skip to the part where we fix everything.

Sam (nodding):
Yeah, I’m more concerned about this Malkavian guy. He’s probably going to turn into a villain now.

Narrator (sarcastic):
But wait—this isn’t just about lava and bad prophecies. You’ve got puzzles to solve! And who doesn’t love a good puzzle in a game where the rules make absolutely no sense? Like getting rid of a baby version of Jimmy Hoffa to enter a cave, or using a sea chimp to overthrow the ancient high priest of a weird cult. It’s ridiculous, it’s zany, and it’s exactly what you’ve come to expect from Sam & Max.

(Cut to the Malkavian ranting while desperately trying to open a locked door using a stop sign.)

Malkavian Vampire (wild-eyed):
This is it! I can feel the cosmic energy! I’ll stop the volcano with this! No one can defeat the stop sign!

(Sam and Max exchange an exasperated glance before Sam moves to solve the puzzle in five seconds. Meanwhile, the Malkavian continues his raving in the background.)

Sam (deadpan):
I think he’s going to be alright, Max.

Max (grinning):
Yeah, if by ‘alright’ you mean ‘completely bonkers.’

Narrator (chuckling):
This is Sam & Max, after all. Nothing makes sense. But that’s the fun of it. You’ll face a volcano that threatens to destroy Easter Island and... you’ll barely be able to stop it. Mostly because, just when you think you’ve got it all figured out, the game throws in another weird twist, like sending the lava somewhere else, with the help of... a Bermuda Triangle.

(Cut to Sam and Max riding on a giant triangle, surfing away from the eruption as the Malkavian shouts from the background, still stuck in his spiral.)

Malkavian Vampire (yelling into the sky):
They’re flying! The Moai heads are being lifted by lights from the heavens! THE FINAL ASCENSION OF THE PROPHECY IS HERE!

Narrator (incredulously):
Oh, and did I mention that the Moai heads get abducted by aliens in the final scene? Of course they do. Why wouldn’t they? Why stop at lava when you can have extraterrestrial abductions?

(Cut to Sam and Max casually returning to their office after the chaotic events.)

Narrator (mock serious):
So, how do you wrap up a game like this? By returning home like it’s no big deal, of course! You just saved Easter Island from a volcano, survived an otherworldly Bermuda Triangle adventure, and sent a Malkavian vampire into the void... and you still have time to sit at your desk like nothing happened.

(The Malkavian is shown floating into the air, still screaming about the stop sign, lava, and cosmic prophecy.)

Narrator (exhausted, breaking the fourth wall):
Yeah, Sam & Max: Moai Better Blues is a game that makes no sense, yet somehow makes total sense if you let go of any expectations and just roll with the madness.

Text on screen:
""Available now... if you’re ready for the stop signs. Or not.""

(The screen fades to black as the Malkavian’s voice echoes off-screen, babbling about the stop sign conspiracy and the ultimate cosmic reckoning.)

La série se renouvelle encore une fois avec le thème de l'horreur, que l'on n'avait pas encore vu. C'est très réussi et toujours aussi drôle. La durée de vie s'allonge encore un peu par rapport aux épisodes précédents. | [H1]Honest Game Trailer for Sam & Max: Night of the Raving Dead — Featuring the Full Cast of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines[/h1]

(Opening shot: Sam and Max, fully suited in their usual absurd getups, standing in the middle of a gothic, fog-covered graveyard. The moon is high, and a zombie shambles in the background. A funky bass line begins to play.)

Narrator (smooth, funky voice):
Get ready to BOOGIE like it’s the end of the world. Welcome to Night of the Raving Dead, where the undead are dancing, the vampires are grumbling, and Sam & Max… are still somehow the most sensible beings in the room.

(Cut to Sam, looking confused, holding a disco ball.)

Sam (deadpan):
Well, this is new. A zombie rave? Did we miss the memo, Max?

(Max suddenly pops up from behind Sam, spinning a glowstick in his hand like he's at a rave.)

Max (excitedly):
Who cares about memos, Sam?! This is the kind of party I live for! It’s like a rave, but with more death!

(Cut to a shot of a vampire DJ named Jurgen, glowing with over-the-top coolness, cranking up the music in a castle nightclub full of zombies.)

Narrator (excitedly):
*It’s time to boogie down with Jurgen, the vampire DJ who’s here to bring the undead to life… literally. Forget about the old vampire classics, he’s spinning the hottest tracks from beyond the grave—but be careful, because this party gets way out of hand.

(Cut to the Malkavian from Vampire: The Masquerade, suddenly appearing with his arms wide as he starts breakdancing, shouting nonsensical phrases while stumbling through the rave.)

Malkavian Vampire (shouting deliriously):
I hear the rhythm of the dead! The beat controls us all! You can’t escape the groove! BOOGIE or DIE!!

(Sam and Max exchange a look.)

Sam (confused):
Well, that’s one way to enter a party...

Max (grinning wildly):
He gets it! BOOGIE!

(Cut to a bunch of vampire and zombie guests at the rave, all dancing in bizarre, stiff movements as though they’re programmed by some dark force of party chaos.)

Narrator (laughing):
In this hilarious, undead-driven adventure, Sam and Max get dragged into a rave from hell, where the dance moves are as twisted as the mysteries they’ll solve. It’s a tale of soul-snatching, zombie-fighting, and getting down with the most bizarre cast of characters you’ve ever seen.

(Cut to LaCroix, who looks mortified at the chaos of the rave, awkwardly trying to hold a glass of blood punch while standing near a DJ booth. He’s surrounded by glowing zombies doing the Macarena.)

LaCroix (grimacing, quietly):
This… this is beneath me. Vampires aren’t supposed to be this… groovy. What happened to subtlety?

(Suddenly, Jeanette, Damsel, and Velvet Velour arrive, decked out in neon outfits, dancing in circles around LaCroix.)

Jeanette (flipping her hair, teasing):
Oh, darling, you’re doing it all wrong! You’ve got to feel the music. Watch and learn, baby!

Damsel (sassy):
Yeah, Lacroix. Stop being such a stiff! Embrace the BOOGIE!

(Cut to Beckett, who’s in the middle of the floor, casually sipping a drink and nodding to the beat like he's seen it all.)

Beckett (nodding):
Zombies, vampires, glowsticks... At least it’s not another pointless war for dominance. This? This is what life’s about.

(Cut to Gary Golden, casually leaning against a wall with his signature fedora, taking in the chaos.)

Gary Golden (smiling):
Now this is what I call undead culture. I might just stay for the entire rave. These zombies have better moves than half the people I know.

(Cut to Mercurio, who is crouched by the DJ booth, trying to hack into the rave’s speakers while looking totally out of place.)

Mercurio (frustrated):
Great, a rave full of zombies. Just what I needed in my life. I came here for business, not this… music mess!

(Cut to Nines, the gang leader, who’s standing outside of the rave looking entirely unimpressed. He shakes his head as a zombie near him does the worm.)

Nines (grumbling):
This whole thing is just... I dunno, man. Something’s off. But what do you expect from a night like this? These are the kind of raves that drag you into hell.

(Suddenly, Heather shows up, dancing wildly with a plush Max doll, looking completely delighted.)

Heather (giggling):
This is so much fun! I’ve never seen Max so alive—or undead—before!

(Max suddenly swings by in the background, pulling off a ridiculous spin with his undead body, grinning ear-to-ear.)

Max (shouting):
Come on, everyone! Let’s go boogie the night away!

Narrator (mockingly):
In a game where soul-snatching and undead dance-offs collide, Sam & Max: Night of the Raving Dead throws all logic out the window and dares to ask—what happens when you take an epic rave, add in some undead creatures, and let the madness loose?

(Cut to Strauss, who appears slightly disheveled after trying to blend into the dance floor.)

Strauss (tiredly):
Well, I’ll say this... It's not quite the classical experience I had in mind.

(Cut to Jack, who’s in the back of the rave, nodding to the beat with a deadpan expression.)

Jack (laughing to himself):
They said it was the end. What a joke. I thought I'd seen the real end of the world, but this? This is a good time.

(Cut to Skelter, who’s lost in the back of the rave, laughing maniacally to himself while watching all the chaos.)

Skelter (with an insane grin):
The dead are dancing! The living are dancing! Can’t tell who’s who! The whole world’s a disco inferno! HAHA!

(Suddenly, Imalia bursts through the crowd with a fiery, vengeful look on her face, charging the DJ booth to confront Jurgen.)

Imalia (furious):
Enough of this nonsense, Jurgen! I didn’t sign up for this kitsch! If I wanted a rave, I’d have gone to a fashion show!

(Cut to Jeanette, suddenly pulling out a whip and “accidentally” hitting LaCroix in the face, her voice dripping with mock sweetness.)

Jeanette (teasing):
Oops, did I hit you there, darling? Looks like your pride got in the way of the beat. Maybe a little tango would help you loosen up!

LaCroix (groaning, trying to hide his embarrassment):
I am a prince… I don’t need to be dancing to prove anything…

(Cut to Bertram Tung, who’s in the corner trying to teach zombies how to play chess in the middle of the rave.)

Bertram Tung (grumbling):
You all have no strategy! How am I supposed to outsmart a bunch of brainless zombies? Where's the intellectual stimulation in this?

(Finally, cut to Sam & Max, leading the charge in the rave as zombies, vampires, and various Bloodlines characters follow them into the madness.)

Sam (cheerfully):
Who needs saving the world when you can save the night… with BOOGIE?

Max (shouting with joy):
Let’s get this party started, undead style!

Narrator (laughing):
So, if you’re ready for a wild, unpredictable, and thoroughly boogie-tastic adventure, then grab your glowsticks, your best zombie impression, and dive into the dancefloor of Sam & Max: Night of the Raving Dead. Who knew the apocalypse could be this... funky?

(Cut to Sam and Max leading the undead dance circle, as zombies and vampires continue their rave around them.)

Text on screen:
Sam & Max: Night of the Raving Dead. Available now. Come for the boogie, stay for the undead mayhem.

(The camera zooms out dramatically, revealing a zombie DJ spinning vinyl records in a neon-lit castle, with the whole undead crowd getting down.)

A plasma screen television plays a muted version of the Sam & Max intro sequence. The camera pans to reveal PATRICK BATEMAN, dressed in a sharp suit, meticulously polishing a controller. He places it down, adjusts his tie, and addresses the camera with chilling calmness.

PATRICK BATEMAN:
You like Sam & Max?

He pauses, giving the question a rhetorical weight, his expression unreadable.

PATRICK BATEMAN:
Telltale Games released Sam & Max: Beyond Time and Space in 2007, but it wasn’t until the fourth episode—Chariots of the Dogs—that the series truly transcended the bounds of what point-and-click adventures could achieve.

Bateman stands, walking to the CD wall. He selects an album: jazz. Smooth, intricate, complex. The perfect soundtrack to his monologue.

PATRICK BATEMAN:
What’s fascinating about Chariots of the Dogs isn’t just the razor-sharp humor or the immaculate design—although they’re both flawless, I assure you. No, what sets this episode apart is its ability to weave a narrative that is both utterly absurd and profoundly meaningful. It’s like staring into the void and finding it laughing back at you.

He returns to the desk, sits, and gestures to the screen. Sam and Max are frozen mid-dialogue, a UFO looming ominously in the background.

PATRICK BATEMAN:
The story? Genius. Bosco—yes, Bosco, the paranoid convenience store owner—disappears, leaving Sam and Max to unravel a mystery that spans time, space, and dimensions. The humor is biting, like a perfectly executed pun in the middle of a Nietzschean existential crisis.

He smirks, as if the thought amuses him more than it should.

PATRICK BATEMAN:
And the gameplay. Oh, the gameplay. Telltale delivers a streamlined experience, eliminating the clunky mechanics that plagued earlier adventure games. Every click feels intentional, every puzzle a masterstroke of design. It’s like an abstract painting: chaotic on the surface, but with a rhythm that pulls you in.

Bateman’s tone grows more animated as he continues, his hands gesturing to emphasize the points.

PATRICK BATEMAN:
The humor is surreal, sharp. A mariachi band in a UFO? It shouldn’t work, but it does. It’s subversive. It’s daring. It’s... exquisite. The voice acting? Perfectly executed. Every line delivered with precision, every joke landing like a punchline in a room full of philosophers and fools.

He stands abruptly, adjusting his suit in the mirror. His reflection speaks now, cold and detached.

PATRICK BATEMAN (in mirror):
But what really stands out is the ending. Without spoiling it, let’s just say it’s... transformative. A sombrero-shaped UFO and a revelation that changes the very fabric of reality. It makes you question your place in the cosmos, while also making you laugh at the absurdity of it all.

He turns back to the camera, his face suddenly intense, his voice lower.

PATRICK BATEMAN:
You think you’re playing a game. You think it’s just entertainment. But then it hits you—this isn’t just a game. It’s a commentary on existence, a parody of the human condition, wrapped in layers of wit and chaos.

He picks up the controller, holding it delicately, like a rare artifact.

PATRICK BATEMAN:
In many ways, Chariots of the Dogs reminds me of Whitney Houston’s later work—misunderstood by some, but when viewed through the right lens, it’s a masterpiece. It’s sharp, it’s confident, it knows exactly what it wants to be.

He smiles, cold and predatory, then sits again, crossing one leg over the other.

PATRICK BATEMAN:
So, do I recommend it? Let’s just say, if you don’t play Chariots of the Dogs, I pity you. You’ll never understand what it means to truly live. And if you think otherwise, well...

He picks up a silver letter opener, twirls it casually, then places it down with unsettling precision.

PATRICK BATEMAN:
Let’s just say I wouldn’t want to be you.

He leans back, smiles thinly at the camera, and presses “resume” on the game. The screen flickers back to life. The sound of laughter—both Sam’s and his own—echoes in the otherwise silent room.

FADE OUT.","The slick, sly humor is a tad slack, but the sly, sly humor is a tad sloppy."

Scene: A dark, moody Gotham-esque apartment. Shadows stretch across the walls, a single neon sign outside casting flickering light into the room. The Joker sits on an overstuffed couch, wearing a purple robe and fuzzy bat-themed slippers. BATMAN, brooding and silent, looms in the corner, seated in an ergonomic chair that screams “I’m a tortured billionaire.” A controller sits in Joker’s gloved hands as the game’s opening credits roll. Batman crosses his arms, watching intently.

JOKER:
Maniacal laughter erupts as he wiggles the joystick.
Batsy! Batsy, come here! You’ve got to see this. The dog talks. The rabbit’s probably legally insane. And get this—WE’RE IN HELL! Another laugh, loud and unsettling.

BATMAN:
Gravely.
Focus, Joker. The narrative. What’s the setup?

JOKER:
Spinning in place, then sprawling dramatically across the couch.
Oh, the narrative! You mean the bit where our intrepid heroes, Sam the dog and Max the psychotic lagomorph, stroll into a subway to Hell? Turns out it’s just a few stops below their street! Isn't that just... deliciously absurd? I mean, who designs a transit system like that? Gotham would crumble under that kind of city planning.

BATMAN:
Leaning forward, his face obscured by shadow.
Hell. Satan. It’s symbolic. Tell me—what are the stakes?

JOKER:
Mocking gravitas.
Why, it’s only everything, my dreary detective! Bosco’s soul—yes, our dear paranoid convenience store clerk—is stuck in eternal torment, and Sam and Max have to navigate Hell to free him. Oh, and everyone else’s souls, too. Santa Claus? Check. A sentient car? Check. A Shambling Corporate Presence?! The stakes couldn’t be higher!

BATMAN:
Whispering, barely audible.
Corporate greed. A fitting adversary.

JOKER:
Oh, but wait, it gets better! Satan’s not even the real villain here. Guess who’s running Hell these days? Go on, guess!

BATMAN:
Flatly.
The Joker.

JOKER:
HA! Close! It’s the Soda Poppers. He cackles so hard he nearly falls off the couch. Those pint-sized, washed-up kid actors from earlier in the series? They’ve taken over Hell and turned it into a bureaucratic nightmare.

BATMAN:
Growling, gripping the arms of his chair.
I hate bureaucracy.

JOKER:
Wiping a tear from his eye.
Don’t we all, darling. And the puzzles! Oh, the puzzles! So delightfully twisted! One minute you’re sabotaging Hell’s personal punishment chambers—turning Santa’s toy factory into a sweatshop of cheer gone wrong—and the next, you’re tricking Satan into joining forces with you. Satan, Batsy! It’s a buddy comedy starring Sam, Max, and the Lord of Darkness!

BATMAN:
Standing suddenly, pacing the room.
Satan teams up with... a rabbit? Ridiculous. Implausible. Genius.

JOKER:
Giddy, spinning the controller.
And the dialogue! The dialogue! It’s sharper than a Batarang to the jugular. Every line’s a zinger, every pun a masterpiece of comedic timing. It’s like they wrote this game just for me!

BATMAN:
Pausing mid-pace.
The gameplay. The mechanics. Tell me.

JOKER:
Oh, it’s as smooth as your brooding, Bats. Classic point-and-click, but streamlined. Every puzzle feels like a riddle—one even you couldn’t solve. Except maybe for the one about summoning a demon with a rubber chicken. That one’s obvious.

BATMAN:
Stoic.
Chickens are versatile.

JOKER:
Ignoring him.
And the finale! Oh, the finale! You’d think the Soda Poppers—those annoying little scamps—would win, right? WRONG. Sam and Max trick them into banishing themselves to the fiery depths of a lava pit. It’s poetic justice! The way they scream... chef’s kiss.

BATMAN:
Frowning, deep in thought.
Justice... poetic...

JOKER:
Oh, don’t pretend you’re not impressed, Bats. This game has everything: existential dread, laugh-out-loud comedy, and a wedding in Hell officiated by none other than Max himself!

BATMAN:
Eyes narrowing.
A wedding? Who gets married?

JOKER:
Sybil and Abe Lincoln’s head, of course. What, you didn’t think Hell would freeze over for anything less, did you?

BATMAN:
Mutters, almost imperceptibly.
Makes sense.

JOKER:
Leaping onto the couch, arms spread wide.
So what do you think, Batsy? Shall we make a pact right here and now to call this the greatest game ever made?

BATMAN:
Standing in the corner, shrouded in shadow. After a long pause, he speaks, his voice low and deliberate.
It’s... acceptable.

JOKER:
Mock shock.
“Acceptable”?! You dark, brooding buzzkill! This isn’t just acceptable, it’s a triumph! It’s a carnival of chaos! A celebration of absurdity! It’s...

BATMAN:
Interrupting.
Fine. It’s... a masterpiece.

JOKER:
Grinning wildly.
There we go! Was that so hard? Now come, let’s replay the whole thing together. Maybe this time you can be the one who sabotages Hell’s HR department. He giggles, winking at Batman.

BATMAN:
Walking toward the couch, sitting stiffly next to Joker.
Fine. But if the puzzles are as absurd as you say, I’ll...

JOKER:
Interrupting, holding up a finger.
Ah-ah-ah! You’ll laugh, Batsy. And that’s the best victory of all.

The two sit side by side, controllers in hand. The screen flashes back to life as the theme song plays. The sounds of Sam and Max’s banter blend with Joker’s maniacal laughter and Batman’s grim silence. The camera pans out, leaving the duo in their bizarre truce, united by chaos and the joy of gaming.

Dangerous High School Girls in Trouble (DHSGiT) offers a peculiar type of challenge. It's a game of highs and lows. Whether or not you'll find it fullfilling seems deeply personal in a way I've rarely encountered.

At first glance, DHSGiT appears quirky and charming - undeniably unique. A quick look at promotional material suggests 1920's teenage rebels taking on their school and town with wit and verve. I was excited to install the game. Who wouldn't love mouthing off to authority figures and getting into all kinds of period-appropriate debacles?

Unfortunately, I was met with an immediate wall to my enjoyment. Most encounters in DHSGiT are gated with one of four minigames. This has been exhaustively covered in other negative reviews. The four minigames in question are remarkably dull. If you don't enjoy them the first time, I assure you, you'll hate them by the 100th time. They never give way to something more nuanced. No matter what the circumstance, you'll have to taunt, bluff, hangman, or rock-paper-scissors your way to victory. It's disheartening, I must admit. When I realized that they made up the backbone of the game, I almost quit right out of the gate. I was looking for story, not tedious grinding.

Well, as it turns out, my ex adventure gamer instincts eventually took over. I have (if I do say so myself) a rather high level of tolerance for painstakingly hunting down a narrative.  When I became comfortable with the minigame repetition, I started to enjoy myself. The characters are honestly endearing. Over time, I grew to care about my little girl gang. Every hour I spent with them added more affection. I saw my queen Charlotte as dangerously glamorous. Her second-in-command Jean was everything 1920's society found unfeminine, and I loved it. I was hooked.

Unfortunately, my love was not to last. I'm confused by the last acts of DHSGiT, to say the least. The spoiler-free version of this review is that if you care about these characters, prepare to be heartbroken. The story takes an unexpected and extremely dark turn. I'm all for complex narratives, but this felt rushed and disrespectful to what had come before. I've seen many reviews reference ""girl power"" as a primary theme of DHSGiT. I think the ending puts the lie to that theory rather thouroughly. I've also seen people recommend this game as ""family friendly"" or an option for children, which I feel could not be further from the truth. At the very least, make sure to play it through first, to understand the conversations you might want to initiate afterwards.

For anyone that wishes to explore the spoilerific:

[spoiler]For some reason, that I cannot fathom, DHSGiT decides to introduce the theme of sexual assault as a major plot point. Not only is a random member of your gang a near victim (incapacitating her for the rest of the game), but the entire town of Brigiton is complicit in said systemized assault. Very late in the game, the mayor is exposed as a beneficiary of Prima Nocta or Droit du Seigneur. Which is, to say, he is allowed to have sex with any woman in town on the night before her marriage.This is made even more repellent by a subplot in which you arrange the marriage of two of your classmates.  You have, in essence, arranged both their marriages *and* their assaults. I'm not ashamed to say that I felt a bit betrayed. The story doesn't feel so empowering as it does exploitative.  To make matters worse, a noted suffragette has traded the right for women to vote for this violation. It's off-putting and unnecessary. I can't imagine making that trade in good faith. No matter how well meaning, it is beyond fathoming. As a woman, more than anything, I feel like throwing my mouse through my screen. This game touched something unpleasant in a way I never could have expected. I'm willing to acknowledge the parts of DHSGiT that I enjoyed, but it's impossible to forget the parts I didn't.[/spoiler] | Probably the quirkiest offering in recent years, a girl detectives mystery story set in the 1920s, presented as a board game with challenges in the form of card-based minigames. Utterly charming! | When you play this game, all your Call of Dudebro friends will ask you why you're playing a game about high school girls. They might even make some sort of lolicon joke. This is because they are boys and you are a man. A man can play a game about high school girls without feeling his masculinity is threatened. | It's really cool and interesting talking with people like in the 1920's. I don't know how accurate it is -but it's fun.
The game has charm but overall I can't really recommend it unless it's on a really good sale and you don't care about the following cons:

First off to navigate the map you need to put your mouse to the edge of it and wait while it scrolls to the appropriate area.
This quickly gets tedious since it would be very easy to make the arrow keys or something scroll the map without you having to mouse over everytime. It's a needlessly slow process.

The second con and the biggest is that the game is mostly luck based. You have stats you can increase but you will soon realize that sometimes the only reason you lost - was because of luck. You can win with the worst stats and you can lose with the best.
The minigames themselves are a bit fun though. | Cute and unique design, but under that it's four minigames over and over and they're grueling.

Then I read the top review (with the plot spoilers) and I'm glad I didn't force myself through hours of plodding, repetitive minigames just for that.","I'm not sure what the hype is about, but I'm not sure what the game is about."

Mandatory game for any lover of Star Wars or RPG's in general. There are few games that do player-character interaction as well as KOTOR, making the characters on your team memorable even years later. Iconic. 
Make sure you also pick up the ""Sith Lords Restored Content Mod"", which really improves the game further by re-adding previously cut content due to time limitations in development. | I have mixed feelings about this game it truly is a great game BUT besides the writing being spotty at times and even with all the patches\mods it will always have a chance to bug out on you.

I can't even describe this game, its simple to understand yet the idea is so unique that it warrants a patent. The in-game dialogue and story is a bit naysayer but who cares ? I do !!! | Planets Under Attack is a real-time strategy game.

The gameplay mechanic of Planets Under Attack are simple and not very deep, but it's good, not too easy and need some time to master. You start with a planet, build up fleets and then set out to conquer neutral or/and enemy planets. But you have to make the right decision which planet to attack first and use tactics. The first level of the game could be easy, but when you play deeper into the game, there's when the fun begin.

The graphics of Planets Under Attack is cartoon, but that doesn't make the game a children game. The UI is good and well designed.

Planets Under Attack is another good and fun game. I recommend this.

Rating 8/10 | Got this game on an awesome special so I don't have many greviences. It's a fun game when you are winning but fairly frustrating when you aren't, the reason this is, is not because the game is too hard but rather the game doesn't allow for much variety in strategies. You will restart over and over untill you find the one strategy that works. This makes it an unbalanced strategy game because you may as well watch a bot vs bot match on any RTS and pretend you are one of the bots. With that said, when you are winning it's quite enjoyable and would be a VERY decent game if this feeling was well maintained. If you find it on special it is likely worth whatever experience you get but I would not pay full price.","I love this game so much but the campaign is impossible to complete.

I played this game when it came but forgot most of the story details. AM I GLAD I FORGOT because, my god, this was a delight to experience with new eyes (GEDDIT) for a second time. It touches on a lot of darker subjects like abuse, loneliness, how we as a society treat children, and the trauma that stems from it.

Like the first game, Edna & Harvey both hold a very special place in my heart. | у игры крайне интригующий концепт и интересная история
грустно, что это не совсем продолжение эдны и харви, но действие происходит в той же вселенной и скорее со сдвигом на доктора марселя. интересно было поглядеть как изменилась психушка в 3 главе, но 1 глава, как по мне, потрясающая, и в дальнейшем игра уже не так хороша
управление упростилось, теперь есть всего две кнопки: взаимодействовать и посмотреть. приятно, что появились кнопки, чтобы скипать диалоги и анимации, без них на все достижения было бы совсем тягомотно пройти
достижения в большинстве своём если не сюжетные, то крайне занудные, типа надуй 99 шариков, поговори с персонажем 20 раз, или сделай какую-угодно любую рандомную херню н-ое количество раз, что без esc, крайне утомляет
так еще и игра забагована, что иногда достижения не выдаются, персонажи становятся невидимыми, съезжают слои картинки, так и вообще можно случайно софтлокнуться на вендиго
я взяла за дёшево в бандле, но полную цену за эту игру бы не отдала
вообщем рекомендую с натяжкой, но если вам не понравится первая глава, то дальше играть смысла нет, так как игра лучше не станет, хотя если вам понравилась первая часть эдны и харви, то будет приятное возвращение в психушку в третьей главе. | Had this game for a long time, and can't complain considering I got it I think in a bundle so it wasn't a total waste of money.

 make sure to use community edition under beta in the games steam properties..... for the  community enhances editio

thank you for another steam reviewer for making me aware of the community enhances edition | Best modern X-COM game! It really feels the atmosphere of the original X-COM of the 90s: it has the same level of squad-based freedom tactics that are good and solid. It's very realistic in terms of tactics and assault. You can can plan your actions as you like and there's no limits or simplifications like in other late X-COM parodies where you can either run or gun, and if you perform shooting action then you can't move anymore. Here you can move then shoot then move again: just use your action points wisely the way you want. The game is really thrilling and is a gem for X-COM lovers. I still think that the best X-COM games are those made by MicroProse in 90s and the Xenonauts, but not the parodies of 2K that have the same name but with much simplified battle gameplay. 
Get this game and you will have 100% satisfaction! | i love the game, but hate the reapers, you see big purple bugs you run the hell the other way, get everyone on the dropship and abort the mission itll be hell. Also you will take losses in alien bases | XCOM with just enough changed to avoid copyright infringement.

That being said, it is extremely well done and delivers exactly what it promises. 

The only regular bug that I have come across is corrupted auto-saves in ""Ironman"" mode which is typical of all games that use this type of save scheme (note: regular mode allows manual saves)

Like XCOM, the games difficulty spikes quickly at the beginning, but becomes more manageable once you begin researching and producing new technologies.

The game also comes with an ""open"" version that allows and organises the use of mods (found on the games Steam community page) | Nie trzeba polecac. Poleca się samo.

[b] Плюсы: [/b]
Хорошее повествование. Интересно прописан текст у персонажей, каждый диалог чувствуется живым.
Большая продолжительность. Наверное самая долгая часть из всей серии, тем кому было мало Кингс Баунти раньше - тут наиграются. 
Много боёв. В отличии от Принцессы, где нужно было очень аккуратно и без потерь играть - тут можно не переживать, армий врага хватит и даже на максимальной сложности проблем с недокачем не будет. 
Хороший сиквел. Было приятно вернуться в старые локации и посмотреть что с ними стало спустя время. Разработчики хорошо этот момент отработали. Видел часть отзывов писали, мол халтура, используют старые локации, но видимо значение слова ""сиквел"" для них далёко. 
Интересный и красивый лвл дизайн. Помимо старых локаций, добавили новых. Острова у викингов сделаны очень красиво и с любопытным дизайном. Приятно по ним перемещаться, визуально даже с уже достаточно устаревшей графикой смотрится хорошо. 
5 прекрасных дев, новые юниты, новые таланты.
В целом хоть и простой, но неплохой сюжет, правда есть просадки в середине, но я думаю этот момент можно списать на умение викингов работать топором, а не пером. 

[b] Минусы: [/b]
Казалось бы что у такой игры может быть не так? Вроде и не первый блин комам(именно через а), и особо нового игра не даёт, но основной минус это конечно же нашумевшие БАГИ. 
И дело даже не в том, что от некоторых атак юнитов отключаются тени, что у скальдов не работает анимация уворота, что музыка живёт своей жизнью и в длс может вообще перестать играть. Нет, основная проблема багов совсем не в этом...

Вы зашли в локацию, а миникарта не прогрузилась?
Вы сделали больше 15 сейвов?
Вы играете в игру более 2х часов? 
Вы прошли около 10-15 боёв? 
Вы зашли в длс? 
Вы сражаетсь в ДЛС дольше 15 минут? 
А может только закончили тяжелый бой и хотите сохраниться?
Вы просто так куда-то загружаетесь? 
А может просто так скачете по дороге?
[b] Добро Пожаловать на Рабочий Стол! [/b]
Вылеты - это главная головная боль этой игры. Если вылетает от сейва - ещё и сейв может быть закарпчен. И это действительно сильно раздражает. Разработчики естественно уже давно забыли свою игру и никакого патча не будет. Форумные советы могут подсказать вам выключить оверлей стима... убрать что-то из графики, но поверьте, это не поможет. С этим надо просто смириться и терпеть... Пройти игру всё равно можно, не настолько уж критично мешают вылеты, но впечатления портят (особенно в длс). 

Второй небольшой всё же минус, вытекающий из плюса(да и такое может быть). В игре действительно много боёв, драться придётся только так, но есть нюанс: сюжет вертится вокруг борьбы с нежитью, а значит 80% армий врага будет как раз этой самой нежитью. И хотя разрабы постарались добавить им новых юнитов, но это не сильно помогает. Благо ещё в самом начале мне попался Меч Света и мой путь на кошмаре был не так уж и сложен, но всё равно вот эта вот вечная борьба с одним и тем же врагом... Эти вот скелеты, которые имеют доп деф от стрел, а у тебя билд через лучников с 100% критом... В общем нежити уж слишком много, могли бы и разнообразить. 
Но сюжет вас приведёт в разные места и драться придётся не только с ней.

Вот такая вот интересная игра. У неё не такой сильный вайб как у Легенды, у неё есть серьезные недостатки, но она всё так же достойное продолжение интересной серии. Если бы не вылеты, я бы даже возможно рейтил её выше Принцессы (всё же ну слишком ""пустая"" вышла у них часть про девочку, и сюжетно скудная). 
И можно понять, почему игра в своё время оставалась в тени. Всё же было уже не то время. Какая пошаговая стратежка в 2012, когда все играли в сессионки и ммо? При этом с крайне однотипным геймплеем. Интерес к этому был только у отдельных ценителей. Однако игру всё же советую пройти, но нужно запастись терпением на вылеты. | Игра интересная и залипательная,ближе к концу очень часто начинает вылетать,а еще лучше не выe6ываться и играть на нормале | King's Bounty: Warriors of the North 1/10

На одній із попередніх знижках купив гру за 17 грн, трішки поностальгувати, і вам рекомендую, хоча б до ознайомлення. 

Гра 2005 року виходу, але навіть зараз грається добре. Атмосферне середовище, звідусіль крики, ворожі снайпери яких ще треба виглядати, робота ППО по сотням літакам у небі, що скидують снаряди, які падають (скриптово) іноді прямо на твоєму шляху, ще трохи і....Тут тобі і відзеркалення будинків на мокрій дорозі, і хоч скоріше імітація, але літаючий лист паперу що несе вітер. Є жінки снайперші, що ж звісно відповідає історії. Хоча свастику гра боїться показувати. Можна стріляти в червоних гнид. 

Трішки душно ходити і стелсити, плюс не в усіх завданнях він дуже й необхідний, але в декотрих локах є непогана така варіативність з декількома шляхами до цілі. Та цього мало, а деякі локації слабенько зроблені, не вистачає більше якихось тіней та роботи зі світлом. Вороги то бачать через сотні метрів, то буває взагалі недобачають коли ти поруч. Так само і по стрільбі, то воно біжить і з автомата стріляє на ходу з десятки метрів прямо в тебе, то виходять на тебе ледь не впритул 5 тіл і не попадає ніхто. І це все одночасно на найважчому рівні. По технічному стану, ну, у мене на Лінуксі було все ок.

Із дрібного: Дуже довгий обшук тіла на предмети; Взявши пістолет, приціл підсвічується червоним і ""бачить"" ворога через стіни, та звісно з малим радіусом; Іноді вороги появляються просто на очах чи позаду тебе, бо ти перед цим зробив якусь дію, якщо її якось не зробити чи обхитрити скрипт, ніхто не з'явиться; Нажаль не прибрати свою ж розтяжу, тільки стріляти по ній. Іноді можна зустріти проблеми із текстурами, чи літаючого щура (їх можна підстрелити до речі), ну та то таке.

Хотілось би бачити у майбутньому якийсь хороший ремейк, хоча нова частина особисто для мене виглядає не дуже, тож може краще не треба. | Esse jogo foi um absoluto delírio coletivo em que os desenvolvedores se propuseram a lançar.

 Nem agora e nem para sua época era um jogo decente. | I don't know how to put it, but this game, despite its age, remains the most atmospheric of this series of games: all these explosions, shots, screams, even the noise of the surroundings makes it clear that this is not some kind of shooter, like Call Of Duty - this is a simulator of an ordinary soldier, where you can rely only on yourself. Unlike other parts, this one conveys the experience of a sniper best of all. No enemy marks. You yourself must determine the distance to the target and make an accurate shot. No minimap.

We all know how much FC3 shook up the whole of Ubisoft back in the day. Whatever Far Cry 2 gave us, FC3 reinvented that, expanded on that and blew onto our screens with style and very, VERY well known villain - Vaas. 

The story, gameplay and villains of Far Cry 3 are arguably the best in the entire franchise - yes, you read that correctly. For a game made in 2012 it still holds it's own in 2025. Yeah it's dated now but its still one of the best games Ubisoft has ever given us.

Before I get into anything a quick disclaimer below!!

[b] This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on. [/b] 

[h1][b] Did I ever tell you the definition of Insanity? [/b][/h1] 

[h1][b] Pros [/b][/h1] 
⚫Far Cry 3 has one of the best villains Ubisoft has ever graced our screens with - Vaas Montenegro. Not only is he ""the best"" villain but we all know his line. He is also expertly voice acted  and he just makes the game so much more than what it should be.
⚫You get to explore a fully open-world, tropical archipelago (fictional) Rook Islands. This was one of my favourite aspects of FC3 back in the day and it still holds it's own against some of these NEW open-world games.
⚫I know I mentioned Vaas, but the other characters... you - Jason Brody who is also expertly voice acted, who is just an American man on a vacation who has to learn the ways of the jungle and escape from the clutches of Vaas and the island. The game has so many amazing characters you need to meet, I don't want to spoil anything else!!
⚫The story of Far Cry 3 is amazing from start to finish. I ask you this - how far are you willing to go to protect the people you love?. From the start of the game being, witnessing Jason run away to the very end, from coward to killer... Jason's transformation is beyond amazing. You truly see a man change.
⚫From taking over merc bases, slave trader bases, racing, supply drops, hunting e.t.c the game has so much content embedded inside of it, there is a possibility you will be here for hours just having fun!! 
⚫FIRE - FIRE SPREADS - RUN - RUN LIKE THE WIND!!! I love the flamethrower, sorry, I must have had some PTSD a moment ago.
⚫The graphics are still gorgeous to this date. I am amazed at how good this game still looks, even against all these new games (that seem to be disasters haha). No mods, no ""addons"" e.t.c, have a look yourself and yes, it's Vaas: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3410793426 
⚫As of 17/01/25 - Ubisoft has finally added in achievements (and fixed the achievement issue). They also removed the MP achievements for us achievements hunters that want 100% (due to MP being shut down): https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/220240/view/508443269496046059

[h1][b] Cons [/b][/h1] 
⚫The multiplayer and all online features are now no longer supported for FC3. It's a real shame because it was so fun. I understand though. 
⚫Sadly, Far Cry 3 suffers from major performance issues on modern computers. I crashed about 100 times returning to it in 2025, sadly. I am not sure what causes it, cores? Graphics cards? Cpus? Windows 11 (XD)? Whatever causes this, its never been fixed. Going to quote a friend (WolfPax) - ""scroll through the PCGamingWiki and finding 3 pages of unsolved performance issues"". Yeah, he was not lying... it's crazy.

[h1][b] Insanity is doing the exact same fu**ing thing over and over again, expecting sh*t to change [/b][/h1] 

[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1] 
After all is said and done, Far Cry 3 is a staple of what was once a company to be rivalled with. A masterpiece of a game with villains, characters, combat, exploation, lore... all done to perfection. To see how far Ubi has fallen really makes me sad but that is a different topic.

Far Cry 3 is worth every penny. I would pay double to experience this game again, it's that good. A Villain that will never be forgotten. A stunning tropical archipelago full of history, secrets and killer animals. Characters that you will do anything to protect, or kill and a man twisted, warped into something else to do whatever he can for his loved one. Far Cry 3 is unforgettable.

[h1][b] 10/10 Story. 10/10 Villain. 10/10 Exploration. 2/10 performance. A masterpiece of a game (if you can look past the crashing) [/b][/h1] | Far Cry 3 is a game where you’ll have to survive on a tropical island filled not just with palm trees but also bandits who always seem to know where you’re hiding. It’s a first-person shooter that combines freedom, a dramatic story, and that constant feeling that the wildlife wants to eat you alive.

The story follows Jason Brody — an ordinary guy who suddenly turns into Rambo on steroids. His path to heroism is filled with existential questions like, Who am I? Where am I? And why is that tiger chasing me? Right from the start, the game puts you face-to-face with Vaas, a villain who steals every scene with his charisma. As he himself says, The definition of insanity is trying to play Far Cry 3 without dying every 10 minutes.

The gameplay is a mix of exploration, shooting, hunting, and accidentally setting everything on fire while trying to sneak past enemies. One of the highlights is climbing radio towers to unlock parts of the map. This is the game where Ubisoft’s “tower obsession” was born — a tradition of making you scale something tall to unlock the map, which they then proceeded to cram into every game they’ve made since. At this point, climbing towers in an Ubisoft game feels like an unspoken initiation ritual.

Now with achievements added to the game, it’s a great excuse to replay it and relive those moments: rescuing your friends, meeting Vaas, and seeing how many times you can accidentally blow yourself up with your own Molotov cocktails.

Verdict: Far Cry 3 is a game you’ll want to revisit. Even if it’s just to hear Vaas explain the definition of insanity while you repeatedly fail at stealth. | [h2]Far Cry 3[/h2]

The game is surprisingly fun and beautiful to play!

After the first 4-5 hours in which I had a strong motion sickness due to the movement of the camera and the too exaggerated motion blur I started to appreciate the game a lot.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3415852060

first of all a story that is already very interesting from the beginning and throws you straight into the action..but the thing that surprised me the most is the variety of missions and scripted sequences almost ""cinematic"" with constant changes of pace and that keep you always active with very few dead moments.
it seems a bit like a mix of many games put together but that makes it extremely fun.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3416581008

it is certainly a very limited game given its old release date which in fact in addition to the main story and the ""extra"" tasks does not have so much to offer even if it still has an excellent choice and variety of approach to the missions and stealth also thanks to the vast choice of weapons available.

https://store.steampowered.com/app/220240/Far_Cry_3/ | Far Cry 3. This game could be seen as the start of the modern Far Cry formula, and I'm surprised I didn't write a review for it back when I first played it, over a decade ago. Now that I've returned to it thanks to the addition of Steam achievements, I feel it's as good a time to review it as any. I'll admit, however, that I might be a bit fuzzy on the details, as it's been a while since I completed it, but I remember having a good time with it.

The story follows Jason, a young adult who finds himself trapped in the Rook Islands while vacationing with his brothers and friends in Southeast Asia. Having been captured by pirates, he manages to escape and joins the Rakyat, inhabitants of the islands, as he tries to rescue his friends. It's a pretty cool story, even if Jason is not very likeable at first, with some stand-out characters like Vaas and his definition of insanity.

Gameplay wise, it's a first-person shooter, obviously. And as I said in my opening paragraph, this game was the start of the modern day Ubisoft formula for Far Cry games; while the previous game already featured an open world, this one added a lot of features that'd become a staple of the franchise. There's hunting animals for crafting ingredients, the now traditional (and sometimes hated) towers to reveal the map, a grand, eccentric villain (see Vaas). Personally, I don't dislike the ""Ubisoft formula"" as much as some people, and I kinda enjoyed these elements when I played the game. Then again, it was the first Far Cry game to use said elements, and I haven't really played the more recent ones.

In terms of graphics, the game looked pretty good back then, but I'm not sure it has aged that well. Even then, I remember loving how vibrant the colours were, especially during certain sequences in the story. And the Rook Islands are a great place to explore. I will say, one aspect I loved about the game is the soundtrack; while I haven't really played the game in years, I do listen to its OST from time to time.

All in all, a solid game which I can recommend. | Самый дерзкий революционный фар край своего времени.

If you're reading this here right now then that means you're obviously curious about it. I'll save you the mulling over it being old and eurojank. This game is absolutely worth your time, it is a PHENOMENAL experience and it still plays very well after all those years (even on vanilla). I bought this game because my friend recommended it to me in high school (a full decade ago lol) and it exceeded every expectation I had for it.

Now, for a warning. This has to do with the end of the game but I will try my best to explain this with little/no spoilers for anything plot related, because I really, REALLY wish I had know this before I played the game:

the last two/three levels of this game are an awful experience. They are unfairly difficult in a way that is not possible to predict and prepare for without knowing ahead of time what you are getting into. I won't go into the context of what's happening or where it is happening, but suffice to say you're fighting an ASSLOAD of enemies that can easily one shot you in a setting that will kill you just by standing in it to long. It is INSANELY EASY TO SOFTLOCK yourself into not being able to complete the game (happened to me TWICE meaning I had to redo about 8 hours of the game for BS reasons). Here's what you need to avoid that:

- you need a powerful weapon with a LOT of ammo. These enemies will gut you as soon as they turn their attention on you; the best option is to take them out BEFORE they have the opportunity to fight back. That means precision head-shots with a quality weapon (mid-tier assault rifles aint gonna cut it, I'm afraid).
- You need VERY good armor. Like I said before, the enemies hit harder than a dump truck here. If you want to stand even the most remote of chances, you need some strong armor. More importantly though you need armor (and artifacts as well) that have good stats against radiation, which brings us to the last suggestion....
- you need a metric FUCKTON of anti-rad kits and medkits. This is non-negotiable. The radiation in the final area of the game is SO ridiculously extreme that it is, by far, your biggest enemy, and by far the single biggest culprit in the game for softlocking people out of completing it. Even after killing/escaping every hostile enemy in the final area, the radiation will continue to get worse and worse and if you do NOT have the right equipment to fight it literally all the way up to the final cutscene, there is a very real risk you will soft lock yourself literally FEET AWAY FROM TRIGGERING THE END. It is BEYOND frustrating. Make sure, for god's sake, that you take the radiation threat seriously at the end of the game. Up to that point, radiation has been at worst a moderate threat in game, which luls you into a false sense of security and might make you not collect enough anti-rad artifacts and equipment throughout. This is a MASSIVE MISTAKE to make. You absolutely need them for the final area, you will NOT SURVIVE if you do not prepare for this. 

There, that's all you need to know to keep yourself from soft-locking yourself out of the end of the game. So long as you heed my advice and keep these points in mind for the end of the game, you should be golden. It's such a shame that the game ends on such a bullshit and unfair note like that, because evreything leading up to it is truly remarkable. But nevertheless, even with the terrible last few hours of the game, the vast majority of the game is incredible and definitely worth your time. Pick it up whenever you can, and good hunting, Stalker. | Играл я лишь в эту часть, когда мне было всего лишь лет 7 и я на самом деле совсем не понимал, что мне куда идти и все казалось слишком сложным, и не понятным. И вот я решил пройти всю трилогию сталкера и вот, что я понял пока что. Если играть на высоком уровне сложности, то игра вас щадить вообще не будет. Быстрее сотрутся кнопки ф6, ф7 чем пройдешь игру.

Думаю о сюжете нету смысла ничего рассказывать и о сеттинге, где что и так, думаю все уже давно знают. Только могу сказать одно, что играем мы за сталкера, страдающего амнезией и пытающегося вспомнить хоть что-то о себе и своем прошлом.

Самое бесящее в этой игре наверное - инвентарь и лут, а конкретно, то что пиздец как мало места. Вроде вот играешь на высокой сложности, а лута все равно дохрена, но он и так же быстро кончается. А если еще хочешь налутать какие то особые предметы, такие как: артефакты, оружие и тому подобное и относить это все для сдачи квеста или просто продать торговцу, то увы это просто нереально ибо будет вечно перегруз. Система выносливости максимально странная, мне нужно наверное иметь миллион редбулла, что бы норм бегать по локам, особенно, когда ты выполняешь доп квесты и тебе постоянно необходимо перемещаться с другой локации на другую. В общем и целом я бы это назвал полукоматозное состояние. Мы готовы тащить на спинах целый блять грузовик с оружием к ближайшему торговцу с неограниченными деньгами и каким-то образом убеждать себя, что это должно быть весело. Зарабатывать деньги в Зоне проще простого, если конечно не умрешь:). Так же в игре нет транспорта или быстрого перемещения, во всяком случае, в оригинальной версии без всяких модов, если такие есть вообще. И еще, что понял, когда собираешься  закончить последний отрезок игры, то должны быть только полезные вещи, а не полмиллиона всего, что можно, которое не на что потратить. В игре также много концовок.

Однако, что делает эту игру такой особенной лично для меня, так это атмосфера, которая передается. Несмотря на некоторые баги и в основном нелепые, которые вызывают лишь небольшую улыбку. Тень Чернобыля действительно погружает в свой мир, предлагая множество возможностей, локаций для исследования, чтобы искать драгоценные артефакты и тайники, спрятанные вокруг. Каждая локация, даже если она немного пустая, кажется сделанной вручную и имеет много индивидуальности. Мне очень понравилось исследовать подземные бункеры, где проводились странные эксперименты, заброшенные здания и оккупированные военные базы. У каждой локации есть своя история, которую можно узнать исследуя мир.

Было трудновато писать обзор, сталкер реально странная игра. У нее уникальный сеттинг и она своего рода нишевая, поэтому ее трудно рекомендовать всем. Большинство людей, вероятно, будут отталкиваться из-за устаревшей графики или сложности. Но если вы сможете преодолеть подобное, я почти уверен, что вы не будете разочарованы.

[h2]What is Alpha Protocol?[/h2]

Alpha Protocol was originally released in 2010 for the PS3, X360 and PC. Developed by Obsidian Entertainment, the game is a third-person shooter where the players control Mike Thorton, an agent for the titular Alpha Protocol. Released in a quite broken state, it has since gathered a following, where many fans claim that it is one of the best Obsidian RPGs around. It was briefly delisted from Steam in 2019 but returned in 2024.
[hr][/hr]
[h2]Overview of the Story and Gameplay[/h2]

In Alpha Protocol, you take the role of Michael “Mike” Thorton who serves as an operative in the titular Alpha Protocol. After Thorton is abandoned by his government, he sets out to find the people responsible and to save the world.
Alpha Protocol is a third-person Role Playing game and a cover shooter. The game is divided into different hubs where you set out on different type of missions. The missions usually are combat missions where you infiltrate a set location to steal data, assassinate or do other things. How you approach these missions is up to you. You can either go guns blazing or take the stealthier approach or a mix of both. Your approach to your missions can affect greatly both follow up missions as well as how other characters view you. Sometimes you have more compact missions, where the only objective is to talk.
Speaking of talking, your choices matter and can change the story and affect other missions quite a lot. During dialogue, you can take one of three approaches with your choices. You can be aggressive, suave or professional. Different characters prefer different type of approaches, and you can gain or lose reputation points based on your answers, which in turn affects your future interactions with said characters and even with other characters.
In between missions you can find yourself in one of the safe houses, replying to emails, checking intel and trading and equipping equipment. You can also change your character appearance freely from set options, such as beard or glasses.
As Mike gains more experience, your character will level up and can gain new skills and further specialize in different aspects of operative life. The skill tree offers both passive and active skills.
[hr][/hr]
[h2]The Tech[/h2]

Alpha Protocol is from 2010, and it’s made by Obsidian. As such, one should expect plenty of bugs in the game such as mechanics not working correctly, characters getting stuck or enemies not spawning at all. There are also few glitches on modern computers where the graphic effects are not working correctly, and one will notice those effects having issues immediately.
The game runs on Unreal Engine 3 and thus offers possibilities for modding and extending support for some features, like ultra-wide support. The game caps the frame rate to 60 or to 62 without modifying configuration files. 
The graphical options are okay, allowing players to customize settings such as SpeedTree quality (controls detail levels of trees) and motion blur. The game supports variety of resolutions and allows players to choose windowed mode if preferred.
The motion blur is horrible, and I highly recommend disabling it.
In control options, you can enable or disable control options. If controller is not enabled here, it won’t work. As many games of this era, you may need to restart the game if you turned on your controller after launching the game or if you need to reconnect your controller. The game supports other than XInput controllers only on GOG version.
The audio is 2.0 and you need to use a workaround to get surround sound working.
The game sound settings offer customization, and dialogue can usually be heard just fine. The game offers subtitle settings but subtitles do not work for all cutscenes, namely for the introduction movie and the ending. Few typos are still present after all these years.
[hr][/hr]
[h2]Miscellaneous[/h2]

[b]DLC:[/b] The game has no DLC on PC, it had preorder DLC on consoles.
[b]Achievements:[/b] The game has no Achievements on Steam, it does have them on consoles and on GOG.

[h2]My opinions[/h2]

Alpha Protocol isn’t the easiest game to review. On one hand, the story, setting and writing really are at outstanding level. On the other hand, the numerous technical issues and bugs can make playing the game at times a very frustrating experience. To give some context, you can try to be stealthy and suddenly the alarm rings because enemy saw you through the walls or spawned right on top of you. These frustrations can become even more issue with how the game saves using a checkpoint system. There are no ways to save between checkpoints. If you make a mistake in some of the missions, you may have to replay quite a long part of the game or if you make a mistake you want to remedy and the checkpoint saves, you’re stuck with your choice or mistake if you didn’t make a manual save of the checkpoint earlier.

However, the story and setting really stand out. The writers offer no ways to save everyone and everything and make you think about your choices. The game does not offer options to pause during the dialogues so sometimes you may impulsively condemn a group of people to death, even without meaning to. The story has multiple endings, which means you can play it again and again to check different approaches and story elements.

Apart from its technical issues and outdated design choices and technical constraints, Alpha Protocol is truly a great game and refreshing experience. [b]I highly recommend giving it a try.[/b] | I liked how there were many different possibilities of how the game could be progressed depending on your choices during dialogue and progression in game. | One of the most innovative and truly unique games ever made. No game is more worthy of a modern remaster or sequel than this absolute hidden gem. A game where your choices REALLY matter, where every decision you make feels relevant and meaningful AND ACTUALLY IS, in a way that literally no other game has ever matched. It's an RPG that actually cares about who you want your agent to be and one where how you build your character's stats and skills is as important to your story as how you play them during cutscenes and conversations.

Can't recommend the game enough. | this game is just good it has great choises you can make that achualy make a difrence in the story the gamplay dose feall dated but the game still holds up.","This is a flawed classic, but it's fun and a fun game."

Зачем покупал полный доступ не знаю. | Such a nice concept... but sadly ruined by huge netcode issues.

An online game of Dungeonland is often unplayable due to lag. Your character will teleport, and sometimes several seconds of action will be missing and then happen instantly, making you dead.

This happens even when you are playing with a friend living near you... in some huge city where the internet is fast no less. So I can safely say it's not my hardware, but the game which is broken.

There are many good ideas in this game, but sadly when a technical issue makes your multiplayer game unplayable in multiplayer, it invalidates everything you've done.

Can we dream for a fix? Sadly, it's unlikely to happen at this point. But who knows?

Unless that unlikely improvement happens, avoid this game. It's kinda worse than the game just being bad on all levels, because it feels like we're missing on a pretty fine experience here... | A unique little game made by Paradox, doomed by not being supported anymore.

Now, don't get me wrong. The only reason why you would want to buy and subsequently play this game is if you had a bunch of friends who also want to do so. As it is, the game is dead. There's very few people who still play and since this game is absolutely horrible with AI (and even if it had decent AI, it wouldn't be fun for long) you'll have a bad time.

The gameplay involves you either dungeoncrawling through a fun, cartoony dungeon filled with monsters and traps while playing one of three classes (who also split up into 3 specializations). All of those have a very different role: The warrior is clearly the tank, the rogue is perfect for annihilating big foes and the mage is support and AoE damage.

The group dynamic between the 3 players is great and lots of fun, but it's way more fun to be the 4th one: The Dungeon Maestro. In this gamemode you get to direct the dungeon! You can use spells to actively harm the players, you can place monsters and even minibosses to create obstacles or make already premade monsterpacks even scarier and at the end you even get to control a huge Boss yourself!

You can take different kinds of ""cards"" (which are either monsterpacks or spells) with you, and the variety and combo-potential is pretty cool. Almost all of the 22 hours I have put into this game are from this mode, aside from farming for some hero items via an exploit (which has been fixed though). I'd still be playing it, if other people were to, too.

As it stands, the game isn't really playable anymore. If you do have 3 friends and a bunch of free time, get a 4 pack. Now. The game's tons of fun and very unique, and you'll laugh your asses off (while cursing the wretched Dungeon master, of course)!

 Симулятор дейликов.  Дабы получить заветный 70 уровень и начать ходить в локации и данжи топ контента, приготовтесь часов 70-80 посвятить качу. Который состоит из 4 миссий, а именно: 
1) убей вражин (от 10 до !200!)
2) собери предметы (от 10 до !60!)
3) отнеси ящик (если повезет то один)
4) зачисть подземелье с боссом в конце 
 И эти миссии не будут даже чередоваться, вам могут 10 раз подрят дать задание кого то убить))
 На 70 же уровне, открывается самое интересное!! Дабы получить себе топ НЕ ДОНАТ шмотки ты должен продолжать делать свои любимые квесты каждый день)) За задания тебе уже не будут довать опыт, а начнут давать ""репутацию"" у торговцев этим самым шмотом) Дабы собрать все, вам придется играть месяцев 4-5 посвещая по 2-3 часа в день дейликам.
 Но не все так ужасно. На 70 уровне вы можете ходить в подземелья и фармить шмот там. Вы ведь качали паладина? Нет?! Так тут других классов просто не берут в данжи, потому что они на много слабее как по урону, так и захилу, о чем вы вообще думали?!
 Теперь про донат, ведь игра бесплатная, а это значит что платить нужно во время игры, а не перед. Он тут влияет на все, на скорость перемещения по карте, на то сколько опыта ты получишь, шмота и какой шмот. Размеры доната зубодробительные, премиум 1000р, сумка 500р, быстрый маунт от 500р.  Имеется возможность сразу купить себе шмот, или заточку оружия, вам гарантируется нагиб в любом пвп или пве (около 1000р за предмет) . На то что бы достич этого без доната вам понадобится 3-4 месяцев и всё твоё, а пока лучше тебе не ходить в пвп. А в данжи тебя и так не возьмут) 
 Итого мы имеем гриндилку. Вся игра будет заключаться в затыкивании врагов левой кнопкой мыши. Здесь нет скила, от вас не требуются некакие навыки (бой с любым боссом выглядит как постоянное выбегание из красного круга на земле) все что нужно для успеха- это куча времени на фарм мобов. | A disclaimer - it's a game set in Forgotten Realms universe, but don't expect DnD-like gameplay. 

Now what should I say about this game...
Neverwinter is a MMORPG, and a really good one. I was somewhat off for the first few hours, but the game gets better and better with every hour you spend in it. 

A disclaimer #2 - if you don't like timegate mechanic and grinding dailies don't read further.

Let's start with some pros:
+ Setting - I'm definitely a FR lover. You should know that Salvatore helped with writing some of the quests in the game. You will also meet some amazing characters like Bruenor Battlehamer, Drizzt Do'Urden or Minsc&Boo. 
+ Music - wether you're in the heart of Neverwinter, traverse the Underdark or purge the Dread Ring of the undead you'll always be accompanied by really nice tunes. It's an MMO so obviously music does not play THAT BIG of a role, but the tracks playing at the background do not disturb you.
+ Character development(bright part) - it's really well made. While power upgrading does not matter much, traits and boons can passively make your character stronger in different ways(for example make your trap also deal damage over time, and even stronger against immune targets)
+ Combat - you're basically on the move all the time, combat is dynamic, there is a lot of dodging, blocking and watching out for enemy attacks
+ Endgame - that is just my opinion but endgame is great. Dungeons are challenging(unless you get boosted by that 3k+ player), long, bossfights are fun. There is always something to do due to campaigns which not only give great rewards but boost your character stats via boons. Also progress is slow paced but significant enough to see the difference between those two items, 30-40 item levels or that one tier of your artifact. 

Cons
- Hard to earn currency - getting AD as a fresh player is a pain in the arse. Enough said. 
- AD to Zen converting ratio - Zen is that ""real money"" currency of NW. And while gathering AD to exchange for Vip(1k Zen - 500k AD) is not that big of an issue, trying to get AD to buy Zen while also managing your characters equipment is. Artifact here, refinement stones there, goodbye 120k AD here. 
- Outdated graphics - we're in 2017, yet graphics sometimes feel like a 2012 game. It doesn't look bad, it had actually aged quite well, but I think devs should consider making some upgrades here and there. 
- Character development (sad part) - boons from campaigns are a double edged sword. They greatly increase character capabilities, but good luck getting most of them. Some of them are after huge timegates(ToD, Dread Ring, Underdark) and others are just annoying to start with(Icewind Dale, fuck you).

My final mark would be somewhere around 7 or 8 out of 10. It's definitely a game worth at least trying out. | Fraichement arrivé niveau 70, il me semblait important de faire une évaluation de ce jeu auquel je n'attendais pas grand chose. En effet, j'ai appris la connaissance de ce jeu via un ami qui l'avait télécharché sur sa playsation 4. Je l'avais regardé joué quelques heures sans grand intêret étant encore en Juillet dernier sur World of Warcraft et Blade and Soul. Mais voilà, ayant démémangé aux Etats Unis, j'ai du arrêté Wow dût fait de mon temps de jeu qui ne serait pas assez important pour pouvoir accomplir ce que je voulais.

Je me suis donc mis à la recherche d'un nouveau jeu qui pourrait occuper mes temps de loisirs, mais ou l'exigence serait revu à la baisse, afin que cela corresponde mieu à mon nouveau style de vie.

Après avoir essayé, Wildstar, SWORT, Lotro et j'en passe, je n'avais pas été du tout convaincu, pas tant par la qualité du jeu, mais pour encore son modèle qui ne me correspondait pas. 

Par tout hasard, je décide de télécharger Neverwinter, afin de voir ce que cela donne, et je suis actuellement lvl 70, et je ne compte pas arrêté de si tôt.

Les points positifs:

1) Races : Tout d'abord Neverwinter m'a plus dès le début pour ses races que l'on a à disposition. Je l'ai trouve plutôt varié et bien adapté à l'univers héroique fantaisy. La personnalisation est très correct, je dirais au dessus de la moyenne actuelle, et permet de differencier son personnage des autres joueurs. 

2) Les Graphismes: ayant plutôt une belle marchine, je peux facilement faire tourner Neverwinter à fond, et je trouve les graphismes très satisfaisant. Dans un MMORPG, des graphismes de dingues à la Gear of War sont pour ma part obsolètes, une pâte artistique est bien plus pertinent. Je retrouve un mélange de Lotro et World of Warcraft qui est très appréciable.

3) Le gameplay: Je trouve le gampelay très bien fini et surtout très accessible. Avec une dynamique à la Tera, Neverwinter propose un style de jeu plutôt bourrin qui change des habitudes. En revanche, le nombre de compétences est limitées, de ce fait le gameplay ne demande pas une haute exigence, et sera plutôt accessible à la majorité des joueurs. 

4) Le monde instancié et cloisoné: Alors oui, pour beaucoup, cet aspect serait un défaut, mais pour moi c'est plutôt un +. En effet, même si l'immersion est un peu mis à mal avec ce système, je trouve que cela permet de gagner du temps, chose que j'ai besoin au vu de mon planning.

5) La personalisation : Il y a beaucoup de moyen de personnaliser son personnage via les talents, atouts, caractéristiques et pouvoirs, afin de vraiment crée un personnage unique.

6) La boutique : Je trouve la boutique très bien faite, et permet aux joueurs qui n'ont pas un grand temps de jeu, de leur rendre la vie plus confortable et de gagner du temps. Je ne suis pas du tout contre ce genre de pratique, tant que cela ne devient pas trop Pay to Win. Après pour les gens qui ne veulent pas payer, ils pourront exactement arriver au même résultat, mais en prenant surement plus de temps. 
Après il faut pas rêver, la gratuité réèlle n'existe pas dans notre monde, et mettre 50 euros dans un jeu n'est pas non plus la mort, quand on connait le prix d'un paquet de cigarrette.

Les points négatifs : 

1) Le Lore : j'ai été assez décu par l'histoire générale du jeu, qui pour moi ne donne pas l'impression d'être réèllement impliqué dans quelque chose d'important. Peut être que cela s'améliorera au fils des futures campagne, mais pour l'instant l'envi de lire soigneusement les quêtes n'est pas encore arrivée.

2) Répétivité des quêtes : Courant dans la plupart des MMORPG, chaque donneur de quêtes va toujours vous trouver un escuse pour que vous alliez basher du mob. Cela devient un peu agaçant à force. La variété des quêtes est selon moi pas assez prononcé. En revanche le doublage est de bonne facture que cela soit en Français ou en Anglais.

3) La musique : La musique n'est pas très prenante, et ne favorise pas l'immersion dans le jeu et son côté épique. 

4) Variété des maps: Je trouve quelques fois une certaine redondance des maps, surtout celles des donjons qui semblent toujours être plus ou moins pareil.

Conclusion:

De mon point de vu, Neverwinter est un MMORPG de qualité, et n'a rien à envier à ses conccurents actuels. Il ravira les personnes qui ont des exigences plus basse que la moyenne en terme d'investissment et qui veulent plus prendre du fun que d'avoir le meilleur dps du jeu. 
Je pense que Cryptic à réussi le pari de la stratégie ""bleu océan"" qui consiste à capter une nouvelle catégorie de joueurs qui n'étaient pas interessé par les MMORPG auparavant ou qui veule moins se prendre la tête.s 
C'est pourquoi, Neverwinter se trouve dans une bonne situation financière et va perdurer dans le temps, car il ne cherche pas à conccurencer directement les mmo déjà bien installés dans le marché contrairement à un Wildstar qui n'a pas pu trouvé sa place et qui brûle à petit feu. 

Voilà,

76561197970698176,238960,Path of Exile,15.35,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Free To Play",5,"Path of Exile (POE) não é um MMORPG, como a maioria o classifica. POE é, na verdade, um action-RPG online. Você não tem necessariamente que interagir com outros jogadores se não o quiser, e mesmo que o queira, sua interação é limitada apenas a um chat global e a alguns poucos (5) jogadores que você, por ventura, permita que entrem em sua equipe (party).

Considerado o sucessor verdadeiro do Diablo II pelos mais saudosistas, Path of Exile é um jogo bastante interessante para quem gosta de RPGs hack-and-slash com uma grande gama de possibilidades em suas builds. Com uma árvore de habilidades de mais de 1300 pontos diferentes além de um complexo sistema de crafting, cada personagem torna-se único em seu potencial, apesar de, no momento, não ter tantas possibilidades de customização visual.

Após mais de 4000 horas jogadas, sinto-me confiante que posso dar o verdadeiro valor ao jogo nessa análise sem, no entanto, deixar de considerar seus pontos fracos. Por isso, vamos por partes:

[h1]Conceito e Existência[/h1]
Path of Exile é um jogo que foi desenvolvido desde seu início para dar aos saudosistas jogadores de Diablo II um ar de renovação. Chris Wilson, o líder do projeto, e seus companheiros fundaram uma empresa chamada Grinding Gear Games, a atual responsável pelo gerenciamento do jogo, e decidiram dedicar-se exclusivamente ao desenvolvimento de POE.

Seguindo o modelo original de Diablo II, o Path of Exile tem point-of-view semelhante, embora com gráficos melhores e atualizados para uma nova geração (inclusive, recentemente, recebendo suporte a DirectX 11 e algumas funcionalidades exclusivas deste), além de conter o mesmo 'feeling' de grinding que tanto tornou Diablo II famoso.

[h1]Jogabilidade[/h1]
Com uma árvore de habilidades de mais de 1300 opções, além de 6 raças iniciais, POE tem uma jogabilidade altamente imersível e de grande liberdade aos jogadores. Ao criar um personagem, você tem uma série de quests que devem ser seguidas sob uma história modelo, dividida em dez atos e em duas partes. Ao finalizar a primeira parte da história, você parte para a segunda, com uma dificuldade maior, já que você recebe algumas penalidades.

Terminada a parte da história e com seu personagem por volta do level 60 (level 100 sendo o máximo), você parte então para o conteúdo end-game do jogo, que consiste, na maior parte do tempo, 'rodar' mapas (mais de 100 tipos diferentes) em dificuldades diferentes em busca de mais level e/ou itens raros e ajudar Zana, uma NPC, na guerra do atlas. É aí que o grinding se torna interessante para pessoas que gostam (como eu). Para as que não gostam, você pode simplesmente começar de novo se quiser e tentar novas e divertidas builds.

Para se ter uma ideia dos níveis de grinding do jogo, estima-se que a possibilidade de dropar um dos itens mais raros do jogo (Espelho de Kalandra) seja de uma vez a cada dez anos se você jogar cerca de 4 horas por dia. É bastante, de fato, mas seu alto valor no jogo faz com que todos sonhem com a possibilidade de tornarem-se ricos da noite pro dia.

Os servidores são divididos em ligas. Há a liga permanente softcore e a permanente hardcore. A diferença entre uma e outra consiste no fato de que, se você morrer com seu personagem na liga hardcore, ele será automaticamente transferido para a liga softcore (ao contrário de Diablo, onde você perde o personagem).

Há também as ligas temporárias, normalmente lançadas a cada 2 ou 3 meses. Elas oferecem um ""fresh start"", ou seja, um início fresco para aqueles que não querem se submeter à inflacionada economia das ligas permanentes ou simplesmente desejam tentar se perpetuarem como ricos comerciantes ou crafters de itens nas novas ligas. Note que, ao final de cada liga, seus personagens lá localizados, bem como o baú da sua conta, serão transferidos para as ligas permanentes.

[h1]Gráficos[/h1]
Além do que pode se ver nas próprias imagens, Path of Exile não é um jogo que possa se dizer ser muito voltado ao desenvolvimento de belos gráficos. Os gráficos são sim medianos, mas mantém-se sempre atualizados com o que há de moderno no mundo dos jogos. Há cerca de um ano, como já mencionado, o jogo recebeu suporte a DirectX 11, além de alguns efeitos especiais a mais (como o movimento responsivo de capas e asas de personagens a skills ou até mesmo o vento). Na mesma época o jogo também recebeu portabilidade para o Xbox.

Sua customização visual também não é muito rica (por enquanto), sendo você, na maior parte do tempo, obrigado a ficar preso ao visual de seus itens e de sua raça (não há diferença de sexos, por exemplo - se você escolher raça X onde o personagem é, por padrão, feminino, ele continuará sendo feminino). Toda e qualquer customização visual não padrão, ou seja, que não é próprio do item que você esteja usando, é paga. A única exceção são as recompensas fornecidas no final de cada liga. Apesar disso, no último ano, a GGG tem investido bastante nesse quesito, com uma notável melhora.

O jogo tem atenção exclusiva da Grinding Gear Games, sua empresa gerenciadora. Com um início difícil de 5 funcionários, ela hoje conta com mais de 150 pessoas em dedicação exclusiva, fazendo com que seu suporte seja um dos mais efetivos que eu já tenha visto (enviei cerca de 10 a 15 tickets e a média de tempo para resposta deles foi de 5 minutos - é incrível).

[h1]Comunidade[/h1]
Você pode escolher interagir com a comunidade ou não. Esse é o principal fator que faz com que Path of Exile não seja, per-se, um MMORPG, onde, por definição, você é obrigado a interagir com um universo de jogadores. No geral, a comunidade de Path of Exile é bastante amigável e disposta a ajudar, mas, como em todo jogo, há bastantes trolls e, principalmente, scammers.

O [i]scam[/i] é legalizado no jogo desde que não seja através de transações da vida real (ou RMT - do inglês, [i]real money trading[/i]). De acordo com o próprio Chris Wilson, a empresa tenta não realizar nenhum tipo de regulação do mercado dentro do jogo, logo cabe a cada jogador tomar conta de seus itens e analisar seu devido valor antes de se desfazer dele para outro jogador. Ainda segundo ele, no jogo, [i]'knowledge is power, and power is everything'[/i] (conhecimento é poder, e poder é tudo).

No começo, não foram poucas as vezes que fui enganado por jogadores mais experientes, comprando a preço de banana mercadorias que poderiam valer bem mais caso eu soubesse seu devido valor, por isso recomendo cautela a jogadores novatos.

[h1]Pay-to-win?[/h1]
[b]Não.[/b] Não há sequer um fator que possa ser considerado pay-to-win em todo o jogo. Tudo que é adquirido por dinheiro real é por mero conceito de embelezamento e/ou [i]status quo[/i]. O único fator que possa ser considerado pay-to-win para alguns jogadores (eu não considero, no entanto) é o fato de que, ao criar uma nova conta, você recebe gratuitamente 3 abas no baú e para adquirir mais abas você deve dispor de dinheiro real.

No entanto, é bem comum o conceito de [i]mules[/i] no jogo, onde você cria vários personagens (você pode criar mais de 20 ao todo) para guardar itens dentro de seus inventários, o que não faz com que seja um fator limitante aos jogadores que não desejam pagar por conteúdo dentro do jogo.

[h1]Conclusão[/h1]
Path of Exile é uma obra-prima dos action-RPGs onlines. Sem dúvida o melhor do gênero, com a melhor companhia de jogos existente da atualidade em sua direção, mas eu, obviamente, sou suspeito a falar, já que ""desperdicei"" (e com orgulho) mais de 3000 horas da minha vida no jogo. Se você gosta de jogos com bastante [i]grinding[/i] e com uma grande gama de possibilidades de ações, sugiro que teste Path of Exile.

[h1]Nota: 9.5/10[/h1]
Pontos positivos:
[+] Grinding complexo
[+] Grande gama de possibilidades
[+] Árvore de habilidades com mais de 1300 opções
[+] Ligas que oferecem um começo igual a todos

Pontos negativos:
[-] Baixa gama de customização visual (mas que tem melhorado no último ano) | Yoa so nach knapp 4k std. Spielzeit kann ich wohl mal ein Review verfassen :P.

F2P oder P2W ? => Es ist wirklich F2P, man kann alle Charaktäre Fähigkeiten etc verwenden und ausspielen, es gibt kein EXP Boost oder ähnliches.

Wie finanziert sich die Firma hinter dem Spiel ? => MTX ähnlich wie in Dota gibt es Armor, Waffen und Fähigkeits ""Skins"" welche das Spiel selber aber nicht beeinflussen. 

Also muss man kein Geld ausgeben ? 
=> Jaein xD, wenn man sehr viel spielt und einem das Spiel nun wirklich gefällt sollte man seinen Stash(Truhe) erweitern, hier nimmt man dann mal 20€ in die Hand (wenn dir dieses Spiel keine 20€ wert ist dann lass es halt ^^), für dieses Spiel allerdings noch zu wenig bei dem was es dir bietet. 
Ich persönlich spiel das Spiel seit der closed Beta(2013) und habe zu jedem kostenlosen DLC ( ein DLC bietet ca so viel Umfang wie Diablo III insgesamt, es gibt bereits 5 DLC´s) der Firma GrindingGearGames etwas Geld zukommen lassen und hab mir davon Stash Erweiterungen und Skins gekauft.

Ist es Einsteiger freundlich ? 
=> Auch hier ein Jaein, wer bereits viele Action RPG`s gezockt hat wird etwas schneller ins Spiel finden, wer keine Erfahrungen hat wird es sehr schwer haben aber gut Ding will Weile haben :P.
Also einfach Google nutzen und man wird schnell merken das die PoE Community ins gesamt nett und freundlich ist und es gibt ne menge Anfänger guides von größeren Streamern. Hier und da sollte man also bei Twitch.tv sich Builds in Action ansehen oder im Forum einen Build heraussuchen ;).
Und lasst euch nicht vom Skill Baum abschrecken, man wird diesen lieben wenn man das Spiel mehr und mehr versteht, genau dieser bietet einen unglaubliche Freiheiten seinen Charakter einzigartig zu machen und evtl. einen wirklich guten Build zu erstellen.

Ist es auf deutsch spielbar ?
=> JA!!!!, es ist nun möglich es auf DEUTSCH zu stellen !!!!! ;-)  

Diablo III oder POE ?
=> Ich spiele beides, aber PoE bietet sag ich mal 10x so viel und ist F2P , auch grafisch mag ich PoE mehr da es düsterer, brutaler und gnadenloser ist.

Gibt es einen Harcore Modus ?
=> Ja, der gestorbene Charakter landet in Sofcore. Anders als in Diablo III gibt es keine passive Fähigkeit die dich retten kann.

Ist die Story gut erzählt ?
=>Nein, keine tollen Videos und auch kaum Vertonung, der Fokus lag wie es richtig ist, auf dem Gameplay, aber mitlerweile wird mehr und mehr vertont und nachgebessert.

Gibt es ein Late-Game ?
=> Ja und zwar ein absolut geaniales Late-Game !, mit lvl 60 ist man ca. fertig mit der Story welche man 3mal durchpielt (Normal,Cruel,Merciless), nach einiger Erfahrung geht das ziemlich schnell. Im Late-Game läuft man Maps welche durch Portale geöffnet werden und zufällig generiert werden, der Name der Map gibt einem Info darüber wie das Layout ca aussehen wird und welcher Boss auf einem wartet, auch hier die PoE wiki nutzen oder Ytube Videos schauen wie der Boss Fight ablaufen wird.

Gibt es einen Trade Markt wo Spieler untereinander handeln ?
=> JA, es gibt kein Gold oder ähnliches, im Spiel findet man Orbs welche zu Iteam craften genutzt werden können oder auch als Währung, dabei sind diese aufgrund ihrer verschiedenen Seltenheit unterschiedlich viel Wert, am Ende ist es ehher ein tausch System, ich gebe dir ``x`` von und du gibst mir deine Armor.
 
Am Ende kann ich nur sagen das es sich hier um ein Spiel handelt, für welches man viel Zeit haben sollte, der Anfang wird sehr schwer sein da es sehr viele Meschaniken gibt, wenn du also ein Spiel suchst an dem du dich messen kannst und dich frei entwickeln kannst bist du bei PoE genau richtig.

Hier noch ein paar links zu Seiten dich euch sicher weiter helfen werden ;)

http://www.pathofexile.com/forum <--- zum Build heraus suchen unter Classes / Builds

www.twitch.tv <--- hier einfach mal Builds live in Action anschauen und evtl Leute im Chat um Hilfe bitten, wie gesagt ist der große Teil der Community sehr nett, liegt vermutlich daran das es nicht competitive ist ^^.

MfG Schlomo und viel Spaß beim spielen !!!! | La verdad es que era bastante reticente a probar este juego. En primer lugar, no me gustan los ""free2play"". Suelen acabar en ""pay 2 win"", comunidades tóxicas, DLCs sospechosamente obligatorios, y una calidad general bastante baja. Además, tengo todos los Diablo comprados, desde el I al III con todas sus expansiones. Teniendo el original, ¿para que jugar a un clon? 

Pues Path of Exile me ha sorprendido. 

En primer lugar, en la tienda del juego sólo venden objetos cosméticos, espacio de almacenamiento, y packs de soporte. Nada que afecte al desarrollo del personaje o al poder de los objetos.

En cuanto al desarrollo del personaje, el juego tiene 19 clases de partida. Pero no son clases cerradas, sino más bien ""zonas de inicio"" que puedes desarrollar a través de un árbol con cientos (literalmente) de skills pasivos. 

Tiene mucho contenido, diez actos. Muchas misiones secundarias, aleatorias, y tramas paralelas (maestros, refugio, etc...). Cada cierto tiempo abren una liga, en la que todos los jugadores empiezan de cero y hay algún evento específico.

La ambientación del mundo es muy siniestra, a ratos realmente gore. Me gusta la historia. Gráficamente no están mal, aunque no está a la altura de Diablo. 

El sistema de juego está lleno de buenas ideas. Por ejemplo, no hay habilidades activas, se consiguen a través de gemas que se engarzan en el equipo. Las gemas pueden subirse de nivel, y hasta hay gemas de soporte que potencian el efecto de otras gemas. 

Hay pociones, como en Diablo 2, pero se rellenan solas cuando matas enemigos, no tienes que llevar 500 pociones en el inventario.

Sistema de crafting básico y avanzado. Se pueden mejorar y alterar los objetos, reforjar estadísticas, etc...

En resumen, un ARPG hardcore, con una curva de aprendizaje un poco bestia al principio, pero con muchísimas posibilidades. Encima gratis y sin pay2win. No sé que más se puede pedir. | 
[h1]Seja bem-vindo, exilado![/h1]


Path of Exile é um RPG de ação 3D publicado pela Grinding Gear Games. Semelhante a jogos como Diablo e Torchlight, Path of Exile permite aos jogadores explorar vários calabouços (dungeons) nas formas de história ""Atos"". Os jogadores têm uma grande variedade de classes iniciais para escolher, mas cada classe serve apenas como o ponto de partida inicial para a progressão do personagem de um jogador.

Os jogadores têm a sua disponibilidade uma enorme quantidade de gemas (skill gems) e opções passivas da skill tree. As gemas podem ser encaixadas no equipamento do personagem e concedem uma escala larga das habilidades, que dependem do tipo e da cor da gema. As gemas podem até subir de nível para fornecer uma versão mais forte da skill. A árvore de habilidades é um conjunto vasto e complexo de combinações de skills passivas. Cada jogador pode escolher entre uma enorme variedade de alocações pontuais para realmente personalizar a sua classe de personagens.

Path of Exile apresenta tanto PvE e PvP com eventos como corridas de nivelamento que ocorrem em servidores dedicados. Outras variações incluem um modo Cut-Throat, onde os jogadores podem invadir instâncias de outros jogadores e matá-los para levar seus itens. Cada evento pode durar de apenas uma hora a vários meses e premiar valiosos prêmios para os vencedores. Os fãs da mecânica de rastreamento de dungeons (*dungeon crawling) mais tradicionais encontrados no Diablo 2 devem definitivamente dar uma chance ao Path of Exile.

*Sistema [b]dungeon crawling[/b]:

O sistema de [b]dungeon crawling[/b] é um tipo de cenário em jogos de role-playing de fantasia em que os heróis navegam em um ambiente labiríntico, lutando contra vários monstros e saqueando qualquer tesouro que possam encontrar. Devido à sua simplicidade, o dungeon crawling pode ser mais fácil para um *gamemaster executar do que aventuras mais complexas, e o estilo de ""hack and slash"" é apreciado por jogadores que se concentram em ação e combate.

*Um [b]gamemaster[/b] ( GM , também conhecido como mestre de jogo , gerente de jogo , moderador de jogo ou árbitro ) é uma pessoa que atua como um organizador, oficiante para perguntas sobre regras, arbitragem para um jogo de RPG multiplayer .Eles são mais comuns em jogos cooperativos em que os jogadores trabalham juntos do que em jogos competitivos em que os jogadores se opõem uns aos outros. O ato realizado por um gamemaster é às vezes referido como ""Gamemastering"" ou simplesmente ""GM-ing"".
O papel básico do gamemaster é o mesmo em quase todos os jogos tradicionais de role-playing, embora diferentes conjuntos de regras tornam os deveres específicos do gamemaster exclusivo para esse sistema.

[b]Prós:[/b]

-Bons gráficos que trabalham mesmo em PCs low-end, efeitos sonoros de alta fidelidade.
-Boa história
-Ambientação e efeitos bem elaborados, ótimo final.
-Totalmente free to play.
-Se você decidir investir dinheiro, todos os preços estão bem equilibrados.
-Muitos itens
-Cópia fiel ao Diablo 2
-Skill tree avançada 

[b]Contras:[/b]

-Alguns problemas de atraso e desconexões aleatórias, Não posso dizer que é perfeito, mas eu jogo tranquilamente com ping bem baixo. Porém, vejo algumas pessoas com problemas de vez em quando.
-Pontos de controle são muito distantes, por esse motivo o jogador tem que correr para o objetivo com a necessidade de perder alguns minutos em vez de usar o teleporte para checkpoints, que são muito longes do objetivo da missão.
- Customizaçao de personagens.


Lendo o site ficou claro que foi produzido de fã para fãs, devido a frases como:

[i] - ""Totalmente gratuito e nunca será pay to win""
- ""Estamos cansados da moda de fadas e luzes, Path Of Exile é realístico e escuro""[/i] 
E muitas outras...

Path Of Exile está de parabéns e merece respeito já por isto, recomendo para jogadores assíduos e que veneram o estilo Old School.


[b]Nota final 8/10.[/b]

 | Первый обзор, постараюсь кратко и со смыслом.

Отличный аналог Диабло, не могу сказать что он лучше или хуже, но для проекта, который создавался на минимум бюджета, оооочень недурственно. 
  Из плюсов: 
- Очень улыбнула графика. Она выдержана в своем стиле, сразу переносишься во времена Diablo2, когда было все ради фана и атмосферы.
- Для небольшого количества героев, просто огромный выбор классов. Благодаря системе развития пассивных навыков, это просто надо увидеть и попробовать, лично я остался под огромным впечатлением. Можно конечно канониченых магов, лучников и варов делать, но так же невесело. +)
- Понравился сюжетный режим. Несомненный плюс в прохождении с друзьями, опять таки за счет того, что билды героев нестандартны и очень вариотивны. Можно творить все, что вздумается, а это большая редкость для РПГ.
- Система активных скилов и крафта выполнена на высоте. Аналогов я просто не встречал, просто один раз попробовать и самому увидеть лучше, чем сто раз прочитать любой из обзоров.
  Из минусов:
- Лично для меня из минусов стала мини карта и ее большой брат, очень тускло, постоянно режет глаза. Но на это можно забить большой болт. Лично мое мнение.
- Есть еще один момент, касаемо новичков. Придется много читать статей и гайдов по героям, ибо настает момент, когда Вы попросту можете дальше не пройти из-за своего билда, нестандартаня раскачка весло, но может стать занозой в ягодной части при прохождении в соло. Опять таки может это у меня руки кривые, а у Вас все получится. +)

По итогу. В PoE обязательно стоит попробовать полиграть всем ценителям РПГ жанра, я уверяю тебя уважаемый читатель, равнодушным проект не оставит, хоть сначала может показаться странным и тяжеловатым. Но. Оно того определенно стоит. Ни разу не пожалел проведенного времени, жаль мало набегал, ибо все время свободное отнимает КС.
10 из 10 тысяч вариантов пасивок!!! Одобренно!!! +)","Path of Exile is an action-RPG online, and it's not a MMORPG, but a hack-and-slash RPG."

I absolutely love this game. I also very much hate it at the same time; but not for the reasons you would think. (This will come to light later on in my review)

FoF has become one of my favorite games, and for the record I should have close to 600+ hours on this game. (If this doesn't prove my love for this game, I don't know what will; and no. Sacrifices are not part of this equation)
I've watched this game flurish in the 2 years that I've been playing it, and there are many times where I've questioned the... elegance of the dev's updates, but hey -- I'm not going to complain... not a lot anyways.
In reality, I can give you a three paged essay on why you should play this game, or at least give it a shot; but in the end, the only real way to find out if you fit this game, is to try it. (The game doesn't fit you, you must fit the game.)

[b]Why you should play[/b]
[*]If you're looking for an amazing game that has no strings attached and is 100% free? This is the game for you.
[*]If you enjoy being the saltiest bastard alive, this is the game for you.
[*]If you want to have the ability to just just s***t on someones day? This is the game for you.
[*]And if you're looking for a strong community that is relatively friendly, then this is definitly the game for you.

But,

[b]Why you should be wary[/b]
[*]If your looking for a game that has perfect connection, this probably is not the game for you.(For the most part connection is fine, but it has its moments.)
[*]If the amazing game logic doesn't set off your internal ""angry cave man,"" then the crazy good players will.
... I don't really have a lot of negative comments to say about this game. Other then the fact that you'll always be salty, and will more then likely want to punch a baby turtle in the face after a few late night sessions with the ""bros.""

Brutal Legend é uma baita homenagem ao rock n' roll em geral, incorporando todo o apelo dos seus diferentes subgêneros num cenário totalmente literal. No controle de Eddy, interpretado por nosso querido Jack Black, exploramos um mundo aberto em plena Era do Metal, um futuro apocalíptico onde a música e a magia são basicamente a mesma coisa. Os humanos, divididos e hostilizados, são ainda escravizados por hordas de demônios, em meio de biomas diferentes e de paisagens impressionantes. A muralha dos amplificadores, a floresta da cerveja e as minas do gelo seco são apenas um gostinho do que há no cenário, onde muitos dos seus NPCs são baseados em ícones reais, como Ozzy Osbourne (Black Sabbath) e Lemmy (Motorhead). 

Com um gameplay fraco e bastante repetitivo, o fantástico mundo aberto é preenchido por atividades repetidas que podem ser encontradas a cada novo bioma explorado. Elas se consistem em saltos com o nosso carro customizável, o ""Diabo Flamejante"", várias corridas, além de coletáveis como solos de guitarra e estátuas de dragão. A missão principal oferece menos enrolação, onde levamos a luta através da nossa ""turnê"" diretamente aos caricatos vilões. Há também um sistema de batalhas de palco contra palco, onde controlamos tropas num estilo de jogo de estratégia em tempo real. Esses momentos são específicos de trechos da campanha, apesar de representarem 100% do seu multiplayer, onde jogadores podem batalhar entre si (Sim, o online ainda funciona!!).

Obviamente, a trilha sonora de Brutal Legend é o seu maior destaque, contendo músicas licenciadas de tudo que é tipo, que variam entre heavy rock/metal, power metal, thrash, death e power metal.

While the game excels in visuals and technical execution, it sacrifices the series' core identity: exploration and puzzles, in favor of relentless combat and excessive action sequences. The ""Shantytown"" section epitomizes this shift, forcing players into repetitive, nonsensical battles with hordes of enemies, completely sidelining the essence of discovery that defined the classic games.

The narrative also falls apart under basic scrutiny. For instance, the sheer number of fresh corpses, mummified remains, and skeletons scattered across the island suggests that it must have been the unfortunate destination of dozens—if not hundreds—of fully loaded cruise ships over decades! And let’s not forget the absurd logistics: how do you even feed and sustain an army of enemies that large on an isolated island? To top it off, aside from the mummified queen, there are no women in the cult that occupies the island, just an endless parade of men. It’s not only implausible but also a glaring failure in representation. Laughable.

For those seeking the intelligent exploration and challenging puzzles of the original series, this game may leave you frustrated and exhausted. If you're looking for an action-heavy adventure, it might suit your tastes, but fans of the classic Tomb Raider should approach with caution! | Juegazo al principio no le tenia mucha fe pero despues de jugar un rato descubri que es un juegazo el combate y la exploracion es buenisimo y todos los coleccionables y  mejoras son espectaculares. 10/10 | Гарна та дуже драйвова гра.

Overview: Tomb Raider (2013) is a reboot of the classic action-adventure franchise, offering a fresh origin story for the legendary adventurer Lara Croft. Developed by Crystal Dynamics, the game takes a more grounded and gritty approach to Lara's character, portraying her transformation from a vulnerable young woman into the hardened explorer she's known for. Combining exploration, puzzle-solving, and intense combat, the 2013 iteration offers a blend of action and survival mechanics set on the mysterious island of Yamatai.

Story: The story follows Lara Croft, who, along with her crew, becomes stranded on the island of Yamatai while searching for the lost kingdom of Himiko. The island, however, is home to many dark secrets, including a dangerous cult and other perils that put Lara’s life in constant jeopardy. Throughout the game, Lara faces various challenges and fights to survive, all while uncovering the island’s mysteries and discovering her own strength.

The narrative is engaging, focusing on Lara's personal journey and her development as a character. The story touches on themes of survival, trust, and the cost of discovery, with the stakes rising as Lara delves deeper into the island’s secrets. The characters are well-developed, though the focus is primarily on Lara, making her transformation and growth the heart of the plot.

Gameplay: Tomb Raider (2013) brings a mix of exploration, platforming, puzzle-solving, and combat. The controls are smooth and accessible, with an emphasis on both exploration and action. As Lara navigates the island, players engage in intense combat against various enemies, including mercenaries, wild animals, and the island’s cultists. The combat system is robust, offering a variety of weapons, from bow and arrows to firearms, as well as a range of stealth and melee attacks.

The game also features light RPG elements, allowing players to upgrade Lara’s weapons and abilities as they progress. This adds a layer of depth to the gameplay, encouraging players to explore the island thoroughly to collect resources and improve their equipment. There are also collectible items and hidden treasures scattered throughout the game, rewarding those who take the time to explore off the beaten path.

Graphics and Performance: The graphics in Tomb Raider (2013) are exceptional, with lush environments, stunning character models, and impressive lighting effects. The island of Yamatai is beautifully designed, ranging from treacherous cliffs to dense jungles, all rendered in high detail. The character animations, particularly Lara’s, are lifelike, and the facial expressions convey emotion and intensity. The cinematic cutscenes are integrated seamlessly into the gameplay, making the narrative feel fluid and immersive.

The game runs smoothly on most modern systems, with well-optimized performance. On higher settings, the visuals are breathtaking, but even at lower settings, the game still maintains a high level of quality.

Audio Design: The audio design in Tomb Raider is excellent, with a haunting and atmospheric soundtrack that complements the game’s tone. The sound effects are realistic, from the sounds of Lara’s footsteps on different surfaces to the crackling of fire and distant roars of danger. The voice acting, particularly from Camilla Luddington as Lara Croft, is solid, adding depth to the character’s emotions as she faces peril after peril.

Challenges: While the game is generally well-balanced, some sections can feel a bit repetitive, especially in terms of combat. Some of the puzzles are relatively simple, and while they provide a nice break from the action, they don’t challenge players too much. The difficulty ramps up during some of the more intense sequences, especially during the combat-heavy portions, but overall, the game provides an enjoyable experience without being overwhelmingly difficult.

Final Thoughts: Tomb Raider (2013) successfully reinvents the franchise, offering a modern and more personal take on Lara Croft’s origin story. The game blends action, exploration, and survival mechanics into a thrilling adventure, with a great narrative that makes you care about Lara’s journey. Its visuals, gameplay mechanics, and immersive world design make it a standout entry in the action-adventure genre.

Pros:

Engaging story with strong character development
Beautiful graphics and immersive world design
Satisfying combat mechanics with a variety of weapons
Excellent audio and voice acting
Exploration and collectibles add depth to gameplay
Cons:

Combat can become repetitive
Some puzzles are relatively easy
Certain sections of the game feel linear
Tomb Raider (2013) is a fantastic reboot that blends classic Tomb Raider elements with modern gameplay features. It offers an emotionally engaging and thrilling adventure for players who enjoy action, exploration, and survival mechanics. Highly recommended for fans of action-adventure games and those looking to experience Lara Croft's origin story in a fresh light. | Ben tomb raider cuk seviyorum ve en sevdiğim oyunu da bu ben cok keyif alarak oynadım erkek arkadaşıma da zorla oynattım benden başka kız görmekten hoşlanmadığı için biraz zorlandı fakat bitirince cok sevdi (sevmedi) gitsin o anca cs oynasın zaten ne anlar kaliteli oyundan hıh","The game is a slap in the face of the original, but the story is a slap in the face of the original."
76561197970698176,9870,Unknown,0.7333333333333333,,0,"This game is masterfully good. I bought it several years ago and was blown away with how good it is. I'd like to cover a few key points that really make this game stand out from the rest.

-Original cast wrote the plot and voiced their characters! (Bill Murray sounds a little annoyed at returning.) The game is genuinely funny, intelligent, and spooky.
-Easily one of the most cinematic games ever created. The story intelligently bridges the first and second movies, as well as expands the Ghostbusters mythos and universe in intelligent directions.
-Revisit popular locations from the movies, without feeling like it's a gimmick! You have a reason for being there and doing what you're doing.
-There is almost no UI! Almost every function (health, overheating, ""ammo"", etc) is shown visibly on the character, via the Proton Pack, which actually manages to be easy-to-read and organic at the same time.
-Tobin's Spirit Guide is available for all the ghouls, ghosts, phantasms, class 5 full-formed repeaters, and spirit objects in the game, replete with their own back stories, lore, and rules. It allows enemies to be diverse and interesting, and fulfilling for lore hounds like myself.
-The game is fast-paced and fun, and switches the rules up often enough as to never feel stale.

The only cons I can think of for this game are that it's a bit linear, the upgrade system can be a bit of an annoyance from time to time, and the ""teammate revive"" mechanic can be a bit annoying, since the boys like to go down often on the tougher enemies. But none of these things deterred the experience for me and, at $10, this game is a STEAL! You HAVE to buy it. It's so worth it. | Lately there's been a lot of disappointment expressed over this new Ghostbusters reboot movie, and a lot of people once again wishing for a true Ghostbusters 3. The great tragedy is how many of them will never know that it already existed 6 years ago in the form of this game, and was even called ""essentially the third movie"" by Dan Akroyd. The main 4 cast members all return to voice their characters (Rick Moranis is absent, tragically), and even a decent amount of side characters come back to reprise their roles. 

The premise of the game is pretty simple. Instead of playing as one of the Ghostbusters themselves, you play as a new recruit, who is about as self-insertion fodder as you can get. Aside from being totally mute, he isn't even given a name, with the main cast just referring to him by various different names like 'cadet' and 'new guy' because they ""don't like getting too attached to the recruits"". This means that there's no time wasted introducing a new character, and instead you just get to feel like you're on a ghostbusting tour with the fan favorites. One of my favorite aspects is how well the proton stream and new wearpons are brought into the game; you get other attachments that serve as other weapons throughout the game, but the proton beam is used to capture ghosts, done by damaging the ghosts enough to weaken them and then grappling them and slamming them into walls and other objects until they're dazed enough to be captured in a ghost trap. The proton beam leaves scorched spots wherever it contacts with a surface and almost everything in the game's areas are destructible, so every encounter with ghosts inevitably results in a once pristine location being reduced to a scorched disaster, making you feel just like the comical menace to bar mitzvahs, libraries, and hotels that the Ghostbusters are.

Unfortunately, the PC port of the game isn't that great. It was poorly optimized at launch, and while modern day computers should handle it fine, if your computer is a bit dated you might want to wait for an upgrade (though even on my modern PC I still dropped from an average of 120 FPS to around 8 to 11 during the final boss fight). Though no matter what your specs are, there's no dodging the mouse acceleration, which still haunts the game so badly that even the Ghostbusters wouldn't pick up if you called them to deal with it. Ghostbusters has probably the worst mouse controls I've seen in a game (barring games that just don't have them, like Dark Souls), and while it is playable enough that I've completed the game twice, it's not what I'd call acceptable, and if you're comfortable playing with a gamepad I would recommend using that instead. 

But ultimately, while the port isn't that great, and the game does decline in quality gameplay-wise for the last hour or so, I'd still recommend the game to anyone who's a fan of Ghostbusters. It's only $10, and while the story might feel a bit too much of the same, it's still as close to a Ghostbusters 3 as I feel we're ever going to get. | This is the closest that we'll ever get to a Ghostbusters 3. It's a great little game with the original actors from the movie lending their voices. The game never strays from the source material. You play a new ghostbuster, only known as the ""Rookie."" All the wonderful characters from both movies combine to make something unexpected and quite fun. Buy this game go bust some ghosts.

Pros:
1. Bill Murray
2. Never had any bugs or glitches in my playthrough
3. I've always wanted to be a ghostbuster
4. (see number one)

Cons:
1. An older game with dated graphics (very minor issue for me)
2. Plays best with an xbox stick
3. Only 9 hours (still not a problem for me, just saying)

Bottom line: 8.5/10, would bust ghosts again 8-) | Ghostbusters: The Videogame is an over the shoulder third person shooter that not only has you blasting ghosts, but wrangling them down into traps. It stars the voice acting of all four original Ghostbusters, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Bill Murray, and Ernie Hudson. Not just them, but other members of the cast, Annie Potts, William Atherton as William Peck, Brian Doyle-Murray as the Mayor and newcomer Alyssa Milano as Dr. Ilyssa Selwyn. You play the new fifth Rookie Ghostbuster, voiced by Ben Stiller. No I'm just kidding. He has no dialog, even though there are screams every so often. This is why you play the game, to immerse yourself in everything from the movies. To be in the firehouse between missions. To play what people call the third movie written by Aykroyd and Ramis. To be a real Ghostbuster shoulder to shoulder with them. I should mention there's no multiplayer component like the console versions.

You will rarely bust ghosts alone. Most of the time you're there with one, two, three or four of the Ghostbusters. They are competent partners and can really do anything you can do. Switch weapons, blast ghosts, wrangle them and trap them. In 10 hours of play, I never saw them get stuck on anything and in later parts, there is a lot to get stuck on. These partners can play the game without you, but that doesn't mean they leave you behind or lead the way. They stuck with you and let you lead the way. The Ghostbusters move as fast as you do, so you'll never have to wait for them.

Another thing they do well is revive. Your health slowly regenerates, but when you go down for the count, they'll pick you back up and you'll do the same for them! Sometimes that's a deal breaker for people. You can even be their medic if that's how you want to play. Let them do the work and they will, unless they're specifically hinting at what to do.

So when it comes to ghosts, there are two types, lesser ones you have to blast into vapor. The others, more difficult ghosts that you need to weaken them enough to wrangle them. Then with them wrangled, thrown around, so if they're scrambling to go right, you need to whip them to the left. When its time, you need to throw out a trap if there's not already one out. With a ghost weak enough, you and the other Ghostbusters need to pull them down into the trap and keep them from moving out of the radius of the vacuum where they are free again. It is all certainly a process that will make you feel like a real Ghostbuster, because it feels like work.

That's the game, so much of it feels like real work. You won't just run from area to area, you'll whip out your PKE meter and see in a first person night vision view. With the PKE meter out, you'll be guided to supernatural activity. There are things you'll need to find, such as clues, but also artifacts and collectables. I went through almost the entire game in PKE mode and I don't feel like there was anything special to find. Its not a fast mode, you'll need to follow the hot and cold signal, sometimes moving around rooms to find where the activity is coming from. The first person night vision is certainly a nice touch, its just not very quick.

The PKE is also your PDA. You'll use it to see what your objective is, upgrade weapons and view additional information on what you just scanned into the database. Everything can be upgraded once. From damage intensity to beam heat. You pay for it with money that you get for busting ghosts. Not just busting ghosts, but destruction. Its woven into the story that New York City pays for the repairs, so somehow you get the money for blowing up cars and shooting through walls.

When it comes to weapons, you start with the typical red proton stream and the Ghostbusters give you three others periodically to test out. A blue cryo beam, green slime slinger and a rapid fire sort of yellow pulse. The slime thrower can clear up black slime environmental hazards that will hurt you. It can also seal portals that lesser ghosts spawn. All four weapons share the same energy and if the beam gets too hot, you need to vent it (reload) or you're stuck having a cooldown for a longer period of time than a reload. If you cross proton beams too long, you'll get a warning, followed up by an explosive, damaging discharge. All four weapons make for a colorful light show all throughout the game.

The proton beam has a default fire button that, and a wrangler button lets you grab things including ghosts if they're weak enough. Then you can use a third button whip them around with a different button. Three buttons, one beam. On top of that there's an alt fire. The proton beam has a sort of grenade giant projectile, the cryo beam has a straight beam when normally its a shotgun blast of a beam for faster moving targets, the rapid fire beam just fires a second shot. Think of that as a right and left sort of firing. Just firing one rapid fire shot is slow, so you alt fire to double the speed. 

Finally, there is the slime tether for the slime slinger. This is the only weapon that really feels fun. Alt fire it once to connect point A, then alt fire it again to connect point B. Watch as the two points quickly come together! This allows you to pull platforms together, move objects and generally derp around for the laughs.

There are a variety of enemies that you'll need different techniques to tackle. Rip shields away from some ghosts. Wrangle gargoyles and bash them into the ground. Slime tether flying cherubs to the ground and watch them smash. Cover black slime demons in green slime. Ghosts that possess people and the Ghostbusters, needing you to douse them in green slime to restore them. Some of the uncommon fights felt like they took way too long, especially the possessors. Can't shoot them, because they're in a Ghostbuster. Then still have to struggle to wrangle, throw them around and put them in a trap. The bosses were big with multiple parts. One you'd need to green slime it, because its covered in black slime, then tear its mask off, so the others can blast it.

The game had a few game breakers for me. Getting stuck in a luggage rack around my feet, preventing me from walking through a flooded hotel's tight spots. Not doing exactly what the Ghostbuster's told me to left them waiting for a ghost to put into the 'super slammer' ghost trap, when I put them in my own trap. The guys are very helpful with hints and clues.

As for the locations, the game will take you back through the first two movies. You'll visit the Sedgewick Hotel to recapture slimer, take on the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man in Times Square, visit the New York City Public Library and even the sewers that were once filled with slime. The game also takes you to new places I guess... like a ghost world with floating platforms that you need to slime tether together and timed running to avoid being beaten to death by books. Oh the game also takes you through a spooky graveyard. That's new right? Every location is spooky, but not scary or horrifying. There's no blood, just slime. The music is from the movie, but feels different like its a different performance and not the music straight from the movie like Ray Parker's theme song.

With everything said, the game felt like work. It was great to revisit mostly the first movie and have great voice acting from characters we know and love, but there are games that are more fun. Blasting ghosts to vapor was one thing, wrangling them is another. While the game is full of comedy written by two of the best and voice acted by three of the best, I didn't laugh out loud once. I understand that the jokes every 30 seconds were funny, I just didn't laugh. If this was the script for a third movie, I can't imagine it being a good movie. As for it being a good game... All this needed was to have the voice actors from the movie and a game that starts with Ray Parker's Ghostbusters theme and ends with Ray Parker's Ghostbuster's theme. | Really fun game to play through.  If you grew up with the Ghostbusters movies, toys, and cartoon you should get a kick out of this game.  Game play is good, graphics look very nice not dated even now, voice acting is great and storyline was well written.  As of 2014 you should be able to find it pretty cheap, so no excuse to not pick this one up.",This game is masterfully good. I bought it several years ago and was blown away with how good it is.

It's too repetitive after a few playthroughs. I played it through four times, but after failing to get a new ending despite playing very differently on my fourth run, I lost the motivation to play again. Each run takes around 45 minutes, which is way too long for such repetitive content when you might not even get a new ending. Unlike a conventional visual novel, you can't skip sections you've already read because you need to forge your personality, earn respect, etc., and the game mostly consists of one-off mini stories in the form of ""adventures"" so there's really no underlying storyline to skip in the first place. On the same token, your personality and respect level do very little to change the content except at certain key stages.

This is how shooters are meant to be! Really cool level design and lots of secrets to uncover. Oddly enough I rather liked the sprite-based engine... pixelated! not smoothed... (that's what a geeky 007 would say...).

Being able to carry so many weapons with you, moving super fast and not having to hide every two seconds is something I really miss in most modern FPSes.

Это реально чистое незамутненное удовольствие - ходить и стрелять во все, что движется. Реиграбельности добавляет огромное количество секретов, разбросанных по уровням. Про сюжетам заикаться не стоит, я думаю всем ясно, что его здесь на три строчки (это не в коем случае не минус, нафига он здесь нужен?). Кстати, оригинальные комментарии Дюка на месте, разве это не то, ради чего стоит пройти всё это дело. В плане графики кроме появления поддержки широких форматов, ничего не изменилось.

The game industry will never again reach this height. | The description says it all: this edition includes all 4 stories (chapters or campaigns) of the original Duke Nukem 3D (labelled Atomic Edition) along with 3 expansion packs that were not developed but authorised by 3D Realms.  We can launch the original game or a slightly more enhanced version of it: this version has additional video options (such as vsync) and generally better (smoother) textures.

There is not much to say here, really: this edition is an excellent compilation of the now almost twenty-year-old Duke Nukem 3D games.  You have everything in just 430 megabytes and you'll be astonished to see how different (how difficult, that is) FPS games were in those days. We have 20 achievements in case you are an achievement hunter - some of them are references to some easter eggs that can be found throughout the game (oh and there are many of those).

For me it was a refreshing experience to play Duke Nukem 3D once more. Oh, and of course, did use a lot of my favourite cheating codes - good to see these work just the same! So, if you like Duke Nukem 3D pick this one instead of the atrociously bad sequel (titled Duke Nukem Forever) and also avoid the classic game that can be found in the store as it does not have the expansion packs (it really is just a classic game and generally more expensive).

Some bugs get in the way of the enjoyment, like a boss where on a latter phase the camera glitched out to the point where I literally could not see my character on the screen. I had to start the boss over in order to fix it and it happened twice more. Similar bugs occur throughout the game.

Although the later stages might be annoying, the level designs are really fascinating.
This game has been on my backlog for almost 8 years; finally, I played it from beginning to end. | Psychonauts is a great game that has some of the best writing in the Video Game history BUT time also hasn't been very kind to this game in terms of control and combat.

Firstly, the games story, writing, voice acting, etc is all top notch and it has some of the best environmental storytelling out there (with exception to the sequel). Raz (the main protagonist) is a fantastic character and the voice job by Horvits is top notch. 

Graphically this game doesn't hold up too well and it's not for the art style. While the Art Style can definitely be divisive personally I think it's fine. It's later polished up and I think looks way better in the sequel but here it's fine if not a bit ugly at times. However the art style mixed with original xbox graphics and low resolution cut-scenes can make parts of the game just look bad and dated.

The real part that makes this game not be a masterpiece is the combat and to a lesser extent the movement. The combat is clunky and tough to get the hang of (another thing fixed in the sequel). The movement is fine but the Levitation ability is completely overpowered which while fun completely negates a lot of the platforming challenge.

The games world and main hub (whispering rock psychic summer camp) is charming and fun to explore but the first levels or minds can feel very tutorialized making the start of the game one of the weakest if you're not fully exploring the hub. The game really picks up halfway when the story pivots to its main objective (not to spoil anything) and takes you away from the camp to really go into the best minds in the game. Sadly the final level is a mess. It's not this super insane challenging level it got over time but it's way tougher than the rest of the game and the bad and clunky combat makes it a frustrating chore.

Overall you play the original Psychonauts for the incredible story, fun word, and cleaver writing and not the combat/platforming. If you do pick this up (which I recommend if you're interested) be prepare to endure some dated gameplay to get to the parts that made this game a cult classic.

Недоліки: важко грати однією рукою | The graphics are pretty bland and basic, but keep in mind that this was originally a Nintendo 3DS game! For a shorter 3DS game, this is fairly good! It's not as long, complex, and refined as other games of the franchise but for what it is, it's fairly good. 

It's got all a the hallmarks of the Resident evil - campy dialogue, rocket launchers, some tired reused plot about a special virus, a Victorian mansion setting with with double stairs (even if you're on a ship!), and lots and lots of gratuitous sexual tension and innuendos! 

Surprisingly it all comes together fairly well! It's FAST, much more straightforward than other RE games, even WITH the backtracking. However things develop fast and there are some good twists and turns for good measure. The story is a 7/10 but interesting enough to keep things fresh. The episodic nature disjointed perspective of the plot being told by different characters and flashbacks are a new take on the traditional linear RE plot. You to experience the story from the past, the present, and through the eyes of all your favorite characters! It's novel and it works. 

It's definitely worth a play if you're searching for a light experience. It's not a masterclass, but it's a fun time. | 卡普空母亲出门没有触发闪避导致连撞三辆大运当场去世 | 这代也算生化系列老古董了，暂时回归了老生化的生存恐怖和箱庭解谜，恐怖气氛也是很带感。整体剧情采取美剧风分章节叙事，故事剧情比以往生化多了一层悬疑感，吉尔和克里斯双双出场（个人感觉吉尔最不好看的一次）拓展了BSAA的故事，本作新的扫描仪工具拿来探测隐藏道具攒药非常好用，小地图也是本作一大特色。但是本作的背包只能装三把枪，属性条很鸡肋位置还不够，最难受的就是闪避和开门，闪避直接是在敌人攻击一瞬间按前进键，判定很迷，开门后人物被迫走进去，导致进门很容易被卡视野，如果有敌人在门口大概率要被打。还有操作克里斯时间太短有点失望。整体上是个不错的游戏，原本以为会很无聊，结果还是挺上瘾的。 | Resident Evil Revelations ofrece una experiencia intermedia entre la fórmula clásica de la saga y la acción más intensa. Ya no cuenta con gestión de inventario, pero compensa con un buen diseño en la zona principal del juego, que se siente bien estructurada y aprovechada a lo largo de la historia. Introduce nuevas mecánicas, aunque intercala secciones de acción que, si bien están bien diseñadas, a veces afectan el ritmo, haciéndolo inconsistente. Los enemigos tienen sus ciertas variaciones pero las peleas de jefe no destacan, salvo la batalla final. En cuanto a la historia, está muy bien contada, manteniendo el interés.

76561197970698176,202270,Unknown,0.0,,0,"I want to recommend this game. I really, really do. It's a refreshing style of turn-based strategy that makes you rely quite heavily on your wits and intuition. It's the sort of game where the winner is not decided by the size of their ship and its guns, but by the savvy of the player. It has a timeless style and an endearing sense of humor that tends to leave one in a good mood, even as their ships sink to the briny deep.

I want to recommend this game, but I can't. The single player campaign could be beaten in a matter of hours, even at a leasurely pace, and leaves much to be desired. It was obviously designed to recieve regular attention from the developers, who seem to have forgotten it. However, the thing that really sinks this game (pun intended) is the lack of a multiplayer community. This game was made with the intention that players would faithfully and regularly play with and against each other, and although it started out that way, it never coelesced. Unless you have friends that you know also want to play this game, it's simply not worth it. | A really great trailer, that is probably what makes the game great, but after that trailer is gone the rest is just... Offline non workingess that is left.
The game does its own ""check"" if you have internet connection, if it fails that it doesn't let you go online, but it is flawed.
It doesn't even let you TRY to log in to their servers, nor give any useful information to you to help you troubleshoot the problem.

All it takes to break this system? Exit the game after first launch, then restart it.
So the multiplayer part is out of the window, the UI is very clunky and the functions aren't intuitive to use, basically a lot of saving is done, and those saves you can't use if you are in ""Offline mode"", so if you built a nice fleet it is all goners.

Overall, this game is now EOL (End Of Life) but the best part about it you can enjoy for free, and that is the launch trailer.
You want naval warfare you have to look at Dangerous Waters or SCS Fleet Command for something that somewhat works, but it is a dead market today with very few good ones popping up to replace the oldies. | This game was epic when it came out, the problem is the fact there is no skirmish mode on solo play, you need to play with someone and at the moment no one plays it anymore.

Also the campaing mode is not worth playing it more than once...

It makes me sad to give this game a thumbs down.
Not worth getting it, not even on discount, you will end up getting a brick on your steam game list. | Механика боя в принципе терпимая, хотя я и не вижу ничего особенно интересного в разбиении рилтайма на 10-секундные ходы. Но реальная проблема игры - в контенте, а вернее в его отсутствии.

Единственная кампания обрывается в середине повествования, не дав даже распробовать добрую часть арсенала. А больше ничего и нет, не считая скирмишей в мультике.

Сама кампания также имеет нестандартную структуру. У игрока нет какого-то отряда, с которым эта кампания проходится, который можно прокачать, или который имеет смысл беречь. Наоборот - для каждой миссии за просто так можно сделать произвольный отряд. Вобщем объединение 9 миссий в одну кампанию - чистая условность.

Наверное брать можно только для мультика с друзьями. И там уже будет вопрос - а насколько оно интересно, разнообразно и долгоиграюще.

It centers around the ability to rotate a 2D world on a 3D plane to get across obstacles and find secrets. Playing through the base game takes a few hours and I feel the game properly explores this neat mechanic very well over the course of that run time. I'd recommend it if all your looking for is a neat little puzzle game.

However, to those with keen eyes you might discover that there is more to FEZ's world beyond the main path. [spoiler]Anticubes, a secret ending, and even a fictional language. The issue I found is that all of this is at odds with the core game. Nothing about the game's world, mechanics, or otherwise made me feel invested enough to want to secret hunt for an additional 20 hours.

Felt like reading a book but partially audio book. Told a good story I do not feel like I will go back through the story but enjoyable once for sure. 
The art was great, the music and sound design gave good atmosphere and the mechanics for turning pages and the little interactions were fun. | Based on John Buchan's novel of the same name, The 39 Steps is a phenomenal piece of interactive fiction, that puts you in the shoes of Richard Hannay, a mining engineer, who finds himself in the middle of a conspiracy and a murder. To avoid being suspected of the murder, he's left with no choice but to flee. Will he be able to clear his name and discover the truth? There's just one way to find out!

The story is masterfully written, being divided across 19 chapters and brought to life with stunning backgrounds set in Scotland and England. The scenes are further enriched by the use of white silhouettes to depict the characters, adding a unique visual charm.

There are a small number of gameplay elements, like exploring for clues in certain locations or doing some quick actions with movements of the mouse, as if you were actually playing as Richard Hannay, it's not much but it does a great job to immerse you in the world.

There's voice acting too, which really adds to the atmosphere, especially since accents play a really big role in a story like this. It was extremely well done, you could tell the great efforts that were put into this game by something as subtle as the voice acting.

The music really sets the mood and does what it needs to do, giving off an ominous and unsettling feeling like you're not completely safe.

There's an extra little feature involving cards you collect as you play, which provide descriptions on the characters and objects you interact with, it isn't much but it provides a bit more insight into the story which is a very welcome feature!

It's a pity that the developers haven't released anything apart from this game, they definitely have skill to make more games like this but I'm happy they displayed their talents through this game. I strongly recommend it, it's free and a very worthwhile experience! | Хорошая визуальная новелла. Советую так же посмотреть фильм","I enjoyed the story.

76561197970698176,204450,Call of Juarez: Gunslinger,0.0,Action,0,"Call of Juarez has really great story telling and voice acting, and decent duck and cover gameplay. Mostly is it really cool game, but there are enough quirky mechanics that could hamper your experience.  The style has elements of genius that is worth playing if you can pick this up for a few dollars as it can be completed once in 10-15 hours. 

Your character narrates his role in the wild west and explains his tall tale version of what ""really"" happened during key events of US old West history.  It has a great comic book like style to introduce classic outlaws in an epic fashion, and the world is bright and beautiful with romanticized farmhouses, mine shafts, moving trains, and mountains.  The levels are mini areas that allow you to run within a defined arena as you hide behind structures and gun sling your way past groups of outlaws as the narrated story offers entertaining, color commentary to all the events. 

The game felt more like a shooting gallery style on rails rather than stealth strategy.  I mostly liked the ducking for cover and the shooting since your character can take some bullets yet quickly recover if you stay out of the next wave of attacks. You can pick up just a few basic pistols, rifles and shotguns to keep it interesting, and also upgrade a few power ups that allow you to carry more bullets, or to throw back incoming dynamite.  The gameplay also has an interesting dueling mode for some of the bosses where you need to increase focus meters, and out draw the enemy.  The historical nuggets that you can find on each level add a side study of the many outlaws who become the stories of the 1800's United States.  It is a great combination of tall tale and non-fiction.

As the game went on, the difficulty suddenly would ramp up and the quirks of the game became more apparent.  The enemies blend into the background making them super hard to see, yet they would easily spot you behind any barrier.  The voices of the enemies seem to come from all around and sound like they are right next to you, even when they are 50 yards away. The Q ""Concentration"" button helps to slow down the action and to outline your enemies but for me it would burn out so fast before I could do much. I was disappointed in the perk system as I used my points on the Silver Shotgun, Ranger Gun, and the Ornate Sawed off since they seemed like the best weapons, although as the game progressed it seemed like the regular Rifle was important to reach far enemies, and the standard Quick shooter was better for rushing enemies.   The game has a few quick events that popped up at very random times and most likely will surprise you and kill you.  When you die, sometimes the game has a tendency to place you immediately in mortal danger only to die again on the same group of enemies.  I kept dying over and over chasing a dynamite fuse that blew up in 5 sec, and I could not even see what direction I was even supposed to go.  Some of the bosses had glitches or quirks and I do not understand how I passed them besides getting a little lucky.  
For the boss Henry Plummer, I could not figure out why enemies were hitting me when I should have been safe behind a barrier. Yet somehow after many, many tries, I lucked out and he suddenly died, and I can only guess that I blew up the dynamite in his hand.   For the boss Curly Bill, he got stuck while running in place in the lumber yard so I just kept shooting him until he died.  For the boss, John Wesley Hardin, I could not figure out what the game needed me to do in the dueling event as I would draw, dodge, but the aim target would wander off. Eventually after many tries, somehow the target worked but I did not feel satisfaction that I did anything differently.

There is a lot to be loved about the style of this game, which is why I recommend playing it despite the quirks.  There is more gameplay with NewGame+ and Dueling Mode  and it may spark your curiosity to learn a bit some of the outlaws during a crazy era of US history. | 玩了两遍了，剧情封神，角色设计太强，又包含以前经典西部电影的致敬，是我心目中最优秀的西部题材射击游戏。必须好评。 | [h2]🎨 Graphics [/h2]

Давно такую искал . Советую кто не любит особо убивать время на беготню и выполнение разных квестов. Чисто стрелялка-""тир"" приятный графон и геймплей 👌 | Cara, esse foi de longe o melhor shooter que eu já joguei na vida! Eu fico impressionado com os gráficos desse jogo toda vez que eu vou re-jogar. esse estilo cartoonizado caiu como uma luva e gerou um estilo único pro jogo. os sistemas de armas e combates podem ser simples e muito lineares, mas são muito bem feitos. A história fez eu me cagar de rir várias vezes e o final e realmente satisfatório. Talvez esse jogo não te agrade se você exige complexidade em tudo que joga, mas se você é o tipo de pessoa que gosta de desligar o cérebro e distribuir chumbo em tudo que é vivo e se mexe, eu recomendo esse jogo fortemente!!!","The story is good, but the game is too slow."

The %of hitting and missing is way off.  It's incredibly common to miss with a 99% change to hit.  One battle I missed 3x in a row.  Anything below 70% is almost a guaranteed miss.  The fact the the hired runners have no armor is absurd.  They are almost useless in a fight.  The game is unbalanced at best. | Игра проходняк, полной стоимости не стоит, проходится часов за 15.

Кроме основного сюжета доп. квестов нет, если честно то сама игра выглядит доп. квестом к чему то большему. | Returns is a barebones experience compared to its successors Dragonfall and Hong Kong: linear, straightforward, very light on role-playing. That said, it's a decent Shadowrun story, and it's succinct enough to not overstay its welcome. I spent a few evening on it in 2025 and was entertained. | Playing through it three times in a span of 10 years, I'd say the game is worth a playthrough. Noir-cyberpunk story, with enough mystery to keep you interested and solid combat. Further installments are better, but this one worth the look still. | I purchased this expecting Baldur's Gate with guns. I was very wrong.

It is turn based and linear; you go out on missions, then return to your home to level up, re-supply, pick up side missions, and progress the story.

At first I was disappointed, but the story and atmosphere sucked me in.

Their are 5 races (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Orc, and Troll) and 6 classes (Samurai, Mage, Decker, Rigger, Shaman, Physical Adept) but racial limits on attributes and skills are disappointingly limited. There's no point in making a troll as anything other than a Samurai or Physical Adept, for example, as their racial limits would prevent any other class' skills rising above 6 points (out of 15)

The games also have fan-made campaigns available in the Steam community

If you're looking specifically for cyberpunk games then it's a must have; if you want anything else it's hit and miss.",I'd say the game is worth a playthrough.

This is probably the best thing Ubisoft has ever released...no joke, everything about this game or DLC, or whatever you wanna call it, is insanely BADASS.

76561197970698176,65930,The Bureau: XCOM Declassified,1.8333333333333333,Action,0,"[h1] BETRAYAL! - Wait no. This isn't that bad [/h1]

This game was never going to be a runaway success, It’s design as a tactical action shooter left it firmly in the shadow of the unreleased X-com: Alliance. An FPS Squad shooter slated for 2001. But releasing this near simultaneously with Enemy Unknown was a detrimental mistake that buried this game.
Which is a shame, because its not bad- despite a few questionable design choices.

[h2] This doesn't make the best first impression [/h2]

Ahem. If you check out the steam discussions many will complain the AI is underwhelming, which it half-true. The companions are lobotomised, until you get them to level 5. Then they become responsive and more importantly have enough health to not immediately keel over & die to every encounter.
Any orders you direct to your squad are immediately carried out, they even change texture to illustrate they’re following your commands. Their actions are queued and each class has their own set of unique abilities all designed to synergise.
Support casts Disrupt, you use the ability levitate, then Recon uses Critical strike. 
Congrats!
You just killed everything except for a Muton or Sectopod. If you time it right.

Commands are done through a proto Fallout 4 VATS system where time slows down, and there is even a mass effect dialogue wheel for interacting with characters. It’s neat. 

The squad is limited just to three which sucks since the player counts as a unit.
Mind control is a late game action which really adds tactical variety. Deployable drones, Turrets and Silacoid’s all work surprisingly well.
The combat is satisfying once you level up your roster of companions. Don’t worry about the permadeath, you can simultaneously send new recruits off to do automated missions as you play which levels them up.
A Total party kill is easily replaceable with no disadvantage, just customise the new squad to look like the old.
By the mid game I didn’t need to micromanage my companions anymore, they could tank most things, the AI automatically avoids grenades to the point they’ll never be hit. It’s nice… You just have to get them to level 5 because the starting health pool and their lack of abilities really screws with the AI’s capability to dynamically react.
These soldiers were lobotomised in the early game, they do get better.

[h2] The difficulty is meaningless [/h2]

You will never fight more than two mutons until the final level, you will only encounter a maximum of two Sectopod’s, only a handful of optional side missions have Sectoid’s swam you on mass and the Outsiders and all their variants can be managed systematically. Difficulty has no bearing on the mechanics.
It just nerfs your abilities and turns everything into a bullet sponge if you raise it.
Whilst I completed it on Commander difficulty, I did replay a little bit on novice and the early game was more enjoyable. The spawns didn’t change, only the enemie’s health.
Call me old fashioned but a Muton shouldn’t have more health than a Sectopod, quadrupedal tank. But on commander oh boy they do.
There is no intended difficulty unlike in classic X-com or Enemy unknown. Play around with it.
Find a comfortable balance between your damage output and the enemy’s strength.

[h2] It has the spirit of X-Com [/h2]

It's no secret that a bunch of X-Com fans rejected [strike] Two & Chimera Squad [/strike] because it betrayed the core themes of the franchise.
The indomitable human spirit adapting and overcoming Alien, Lovecraftian and interdimensional threats. A rag tag group of rainbow resistance warriors isn’t X-com.
The idea that we’re in waters so uncharted that despite have an entire facility, bureau, military or even a full-on megacity at your disposal. And you’re still on the backfoot is X-Com. It’s the best of the best having to rise beyond their limitations to save humanity. It shouldn’t be a plucky underdog story.
It’s a war of attrition between the best & brightest and the horrors of the uknown.

The Bureau, X-Com declassified [i] gets [/i] this. It understands the necessity of having an established facility which is impressive considering there is zero research or base management. 

Everyone around you is a highly trained professional from various background selected to defend humanity. It’s X-Com with a little more personality and a stronger than average narrative. 
Is it a good narrative? 
Eh, it has major pacing issues. There are only 7 mainline and 7 optional missions. But it doesn’t playout as predictably as the classics or Enemy Unknown does, someone was having fun writing this and whilst its brevity takes away from the intended emotional impact… 
It has more going on than most 7th gen shooters. 

[h2] The none existent technical hic-ups [/h2]

A lot of people state this game doesn’t run on windows 11.
I have the dreaded 24H2 build and it runs perfectly. [b] First time booting the game did take several minutes [/b] but every start up afterwards was immediate.
I’m running an Integrated RTX 3050 4gb, hardly cutting edge stuff for the 2020’s and the game ran with out a single crash.
The cutscenes are pre-recorded in 720p with some terrible compression. It looks bad.

There is full controller support right out of the box, plays well with my 3rd party Xbox One controller. No issues.
The texture work is surprisingly great, you can read almost all the chalkboards, posters and graffiti present in the environments. It adds to the conspiracy latent atmosphere the game is striving for.

[h2] It’s well worth it when on a sale [/h2]

For $2 of $5 it’s a fun little distraction, it’s hardly the betrayal Spoony [Godspeed my sweet prince, find the help you need] led me to believe it was back in 2012.
It’s far from the worst entry in the franchise.
Sure, if Alliance was playable this would be a redundant entry (Unless you really liked the cold war aesthetic) but as some one who brought this after sinking 150+ hours into Enemy within in the space of two weeks, yeah this has the X-Com spirit I yearn for. 

10-15 Hours of gameplay, if you get the DLC then I could see 20 at a push. There is no new game plus or randomly generated missions everything in this game was purposely designed which is something of a lost art now-a-days.

I will add the marketing for this game did it no favours, like seriously. This isn’t a bad game it’s just that everything surrounding it, including its marketing absolutely betrayed it. Heh. I guess there was betrayal after all. | Para mi es un juego clásico de Xbox 360, con una muy buena historia y opciones de juego. 
 | It's not a bad game. The story is set in an alternate timeline to the mainline games, and you get to experience the conflict from another perspective. Too bad we don't see [i]all[/i] the enemy types, and the forced squad management is more annoying than helpful, but it's not a complete disaster.

Do note, that there are technical issues with this game on modern hardware: PhysX tanks your performance even when it works, high frame rates will make you stumble on level geometry, some triggers may fail to trigger, so you'd stuck and will have to restart from a checkpoint. | Really bad dialogue. I thought I'd be able to ignore it and just enjoy the gameplay, but there are big sections of dialogue where the characters are rude to their coworkers and allies for no reason. They're not rude in a funny or entertaining way, just randomly mean. | World and story is decent, but the gameplay is just boring and dated now.","The AI is a bit sluggish, but the combat is satisfying."

Auf den ersten Blick wirkt Reus unglaublich charmant.

Und das ändert sich auch während des Spielens nicht.
Ausser, dass man sich hin und wieder dabei ertaptt, sich zu wünschen, dass noch mehr Animationen und Wuselfaktoren ihren Weg ins Spiel finden würden.

Hier noch ein Hühnchen mehr, dort ein Fischerbötchen, vielleicht noch ein paar Wettereffekte, Tag & Nachtwechsel, Godrays, Lensflares, ...

Aber für so ein niederländisches Indie-Studio mit nur wenig Manpower (gerade mal 4 Leute) ist das schon sehr stark.
Man sieht eigentlich schon schön auf einen Blick woran es bei der jeweiligen Siedlung/ Stadt so hapert ... oder wo es gut läuft.

Wie bei ""DIE SIEDLER"" oder ""ANNO"" - nur das hier eben riesige Teams dahinter stecken, die ganz andere Effekte reinballern konnten.

Die dreh- und zoombaren Planeten in echter 3D wie bei Populous 3 wäre natürlich auch schick.
Aber auch die 2D Ansicht ist ... naja, wie erwähnt: charmant.

Hier erinnert es dann doch an Populous 1 und 2 oder auch Siedler 1 und 2.
Da ist die Geräuschkulisse ähnlich unaufgeregt und lenkt nicht vom Geschehen ab.

Mit grausen denke ich noch an das permanent-penetrante ""WIR MÜSSEN HÜTTEN BAUEN"" aus Black & White 1, was mich irgendwann dermaßen aggressiv machte, dass ich meiner Kreatur befahl alle Dorfbewohner zu fressen und zu zerstampfen.

Um was geht es denn nun?

Ist das so eine Art:
- Populous?
- Black & White?
- Dungeon Keeper?
- Dust?

Nope.
Alle diese oberen Spiele sind wahre Götter unter den - nun- Göttersimulationen.

Auch wenn man hier Titanen steuert, die eigene Fähigkeiten haben:
- Löcher graben und Wasser fluten
- Berge anheben und Wüsten schaffen
- Wälder und Sümpfe aus dem Boden zaubern
- Tiere, Pflanzen, Fische, Mineralien, etc. erschaffen
- bestehende Landstücke und Fauna/Flora verbessern, aufleveln...
wird nie eine Göttersimulation alá Populous daraus,

Es gibt quasi keine gegnerischen Entitäten.

Du bist ein Planet und versuchst das Beste aus Dir zu machen.
Das Beste besteht in diesem Fall darin weit fortschrittliche Dörfer und Städte gedeihen zu lassen, die sich nicht gegenseitig an die Gurgel gehen!

Dazu ist Deine gesamte Oberfläche in Parzellen eingeteilt.

Und je nachdem welche Parzelle neben welcher anderen:
- platziert und
- gehegt und
- gebufft und
- generfed und
- entwickelt
wird entstehen andere Synergie- und Kupplungseffekte.

Symbiosen genannt.

Im Grunde wie ein gutes Kartendeck-Legespiel.

Manchmal musste ich schmunzelnd an YU GI OH denken.
Erst spiele ich diese Karte und wenn ich diese andere daneben packe, werte ich die erste auf und wenn ich dann noch diese eine dritte dazu werfe, ändert sich der Effekt auf die beiden anderen und sie werden noch mächtiger.

Wenn die Dörfer und Städte wachsen dann stellen sie Botschafter ab, die Du auf Deine Titanen packst und die dann noch weitere Fähigkeiten freischalten.
Dann kannst Du beispielsweise aus ""normalen"" Tieren ""exotische Tiere"" machen, die dann nicht nur Nahrung, sondern auch Reichtum bringen, usw.

Also bitte KEIN Populous erwarten!

I have tried so many other ego-shooters and nothing can compete gameplay-wise for my taste. | This game is hard to review. There are a lot of tactics involved in this World War 2 game when it comes down to finding a good position and deciding when to take more territory. Overall great WW2 shooter and map design! On the other hand, the devs did a sloppy job when it came to removing the single player campaign because they were incapable of making it work. I've never heard of a game developer removing this much from a game. It's a first. They also kept the single player achievements and promised to fix it later even though the campaign was removed. Kick the bucket down the road. Then they said the game is too old so the devs won't fix it. There is also an impossible achievement because of a progress bug the devs screwed up on and gave everyone who had the bug an achievement called inb4reset which is not a reward for something the player did but a mistake from the devs  so it was a limited time achievement. Weird and unheard of to get an achievement for the developers mistake for bugging everyone's progress. I just find it very strange. There are a lot of other bugs and problems with the game. It is still a great multiplayer game. So I'll let you decide if this game is right for you. If achievements are not important to you, and you want to get another WW2 shooter, then I say go for it.

For people curious about this game, I'd actually recommend going in blind for the story. This comes with the benefit (or drawback depending on how you look at it emotionally) of the jokes and emotional bits hitting much harder. 

To end things off, my favorite character in this game is easily Fidget.

I absolutely hope this game gets a sequel, it deserves it. | 第二十八款通关的类银，偏神之天平的rpg，中等水平，全成就难度较低。

剧情除了结局boss行为迷惑没啥问题，画风虹猫蓝兔童话风也还行，音乐可以听但印象不深，彩蛋很多（恶魔城，fez，braid，堡垒等等），配音优秀，感情充沛，特别是fidget小腹黑，但整体人物塑造还不算完整，引导提示较友好，具有轻微解密元素。

战斗较差，虽说是act，但敌人的花样很少，攻击欲望极低而且很千篇一律，主角性能过强导致战斗交互感极差，但是数值上又是被揍几下就残（好在伤害不溢出太多的时候会保留一滴血）存档点还不能回满（大概1/4）连招种类虽多实际用处大的就是小烦魔弹配合沙尘暴。

最后，全成就初始选困难难度，做好sl可以一周目完成，（就算不sl，重开周目也很快，大概一小时不到）唯一的分歧点是洗衣服那里是否投毒对应两个成就，其他全收集即可完成，另外matti是弓手山脉顶端铁匠旁边的沉默哼哼弟弟，对话五次跳成就，1k＋combo戴减攻击戒指找个怪多的地方闪电魔弹龙卷风几下就满。

最后的最后，中译名怎么回事，打完完全不知道幸福的轨迹怎么理解，就算翻成幸福的尾巴也很难理解，另外看结尾像留白给出二做准备，发售这么久看来鸽了，有点遗憾。 | 難度友善

算是类银河城吧，有几个能力锁，滑铲、爬墙、二段跳、大跳都是随流程解锁。画风偏卡通，全员都是furry，服饰明显朝鲜。
本来以为会是吃操作的清版砍杀，结果除了出生自带的连招外，没有任何新动作，开始什么样，结局还是什么样。不过打击感确实不错，砍人音效很爽，非常夸张的近战吸附，过于飘逸的移动性能，导致打空连时经常到处飞（跟流浪者一比手感巨好）。
升级加的全是数值，血攻防蓝四项，升一级可以加其中一项，而加一次数值飙升，之前中毒血量蹭蹭掉，升两级后血条都不带动的。（因为血条长度不变，单纯数值加大）
还有简陋的装备系统，也全是数值差别，而且这个蓝图和铁匠用处不大，商店的物品会随流程更新，地图的宝箱里也有好装备，完全不需要刷材料自己做（除了最强的几个装备）
玩家数值膨胀，敌人数值也膨胀。每章新地图新怪初见伤害非常高，被碰几下就残血，玩家打他们就是刮痧，必须一直空连。升两级换套装备后又变成敌人刮痧了…然后下张地图又是如此循环。后面越打越无聊。
高情商，让你每章初见都能体验高速act的刺激。
地图设计也挺一般的，能力锁设计过于死板，反倒是有些跟能力无关的解密挺有意思。

Gunpoint es un juego de puzzles y plataformas, pero con un enfoque más pausado, donde prima la estrategia y el sigilo. Somos Richard Conway, un espía freelance (autónomo) que por casualidad es grabado por las cámaras de seguridad en la escena de un crimen, el asesinato de Selena Delgado. La jefa de esta mujer, Melanie Rooke, se pone en contacto con nosotros para pedirnos que recuperemos la grabación donde aparece el asesino real de su empleada y amiga Selena, chantajeándonos con que de lo contrario, la policía pensará que nosotros somos el asesino. De este modo deberemos infiltrarnos en distintas instalaciones bien vigiladas para hackear diversos dispositivos y obtener información sensible. Sin embargo, poco a poco iremos adentrándonos en una red de conspiraciones mucho más profunda de lo que cabría esperar, donde se ven implicadas las grandes empresas armamentísticas del país y la policía. Por ello, diferentes personajes contactarán con nosotros para reclamar nuestros servicios o pedirnos ayuda con diversos problemas personales, siendo nuestro principal objetivo desenmascarar al verdadero asesino de Selena.

[h2]Jugabilidad / Apartado técnico[/h2]
Gunpoint nos ofrece diferentes misiones de dificultad y complejidad creciente, donde el principal objetivo suele ser colarse en instalaciones fuertemente vigiladas para hackear algún ordenador, robar objetos clave o escuchar conversaciones privadas. Para ello, nuestro espía podrá hacer uso de una gran variedad de gadgets y dispositivos de alta tecnología que harán su labor de infiltración mucho más sencilla. Por un lado, contamos con los pantalones Bullfrog, los cuales nos permiten saltar grandes distancias, noquear a nuestros enemigos o caer desde alturas sorprendentemente altas. Por otro, iremos adquiriendo nuevos aparatos que harán nuestra vida más sencilla, siendo el Crosslink el más importante. Este dispositivo introduce las mecánicas de puzzle al juego, permitiéndonos ver la instalación eléctrica del edificio y “recablear” diferentes aparatos a voluntad, como interruptores, puertas, cámaras de seguridad, lámparas, etc. En cada misión deberemos hacer uso de estas mecánicas para completar las distintas misiones que nos ofrezcan, tratando de cumplir con ciertos parámetros de sigilo, violencia, tiempo, etc., y siendo recompensados económicamente por nuestros servicios para así, hacernos con nueva tecnología.

[h2]Valoración[/h2]
Gunpoint es un juego de puzzles realmente bueno, que sabe introducir las mecánicas de acción y sigilo de una forma muy interesante. Su jugabilidad es muy dinámica, ya que primero nos obliga a observar y pensar tranquilamente cómo vamos a llevar a cabo la misión, decidiendo que aparatos recablear, qué puertas debemos tomar, la ruta de vigilancia que siguen nuestros enemigos, etc., para luego llevar nuestro plan a la acción de forma rápida y limpia, sin ser vistos ni morir en el intento. La forma de abordar cada misión puede ser diferente y creativa, dejando cierto poder de decisión al jugador para tomar distintas rutas o usar diferentes aparatos. Además, también podremos elegir entre varias opciones de diálogo con nuestros clientes, pudiendo modificar el resultado final de la historia. En resumen, un gran juego de puzzles que recomiendo probar y que ofrece entre 6-7 horas de entretenimiento.
Lo salvaría de un incendio! 👨‍🚒👍🔥

Unfortunately, there are various bugs that have not been fixed, which regularly cause the game to crash. Therefore, unfortunately I can no longer recommend it. | ギリ、オススメします。クローン作って面白いんですが、ちょっと短いので減点です。 | Even though I recommend the game it's faulty. When I booted it up for the first time my mouse wouldn't move. So to just move the mouse, I had to change the game version from my Steam library to ""Compatibility mode"". Also, when interacting with secrets the game freezes until you bring up task manager and shut it down. The fix is playing the game with Steam in offline mode. When you finish the game you can boot it up in online mode to get your achievements without problem. Those two bugs are the only ones I encountered, but they are pretty big, right? 

If you get over the bugs there is a great sequence of puzzles awaiting you. I really enjoyed that part. Pretty good difficulty curve and interesting mechanics. Just for those hours of fun the game is worth it. 

The graphics are unique, and the scenarios are amazing. The only thing I didn't like about the looks of the game was the animations and the characters; they took all seriousness out from every scene for me. 

The premise is super interesting; it doesn't pay off that well to me, though. Dialogs were another weak point of this work. They were filled to the brim with exposition without developing any character at all. I leave this game disappointed that it didn't make me feel anything for itself. Just to clarify, this is very subjective, and I do believe that most people will enjoy the story very much for how different it is from most other games.

 | The Swapper is the kind of game that messes with your brain—in the best way possible. This indie gem blends eerie sci-fi storytelling with mind-bending puzzle mechanics, all wrapped in a beautifully handcrafted, unsettling atmosphere. The central gimmick? A cloning device that lets you create copies of yourself and swap control between them. Simple? At first. Existentially horrifying? Absolutely.

The puzzles are brilliantly designed, constantly making you rethink space, identity, and what it means to be “you.” The haunting soundtrack and lonely, oppressive setting make every step through the abandoned space station feel like a philosophical journey.

76561197970698176,233250,Unknown,0.0333333333333333,,0,"Planetary Annihilation (PA) - весьма необычная, а скорее, даже уникальная в своём роде стратегия в реальном времени, полями боя в которой являются не привычные современным игрокам плоские карты, а целые луны, планеты, и даже планетарные системы. Собственно говоря, первая ""фишка"" игры заключается в сферичности карт, то есть, в отличие от классических RTS, игрок может подвергнуться нападению откуда угодно, что на корню изменяет стратегию игры. Защищаться приходится сразу со всех сторон, невозможно просто отгородиться от неприятеля стеной турелей, так как любую стену можно просто-напросто обойти. Вполне очевидно, что такое построение игрового пространства открывает игрокам огромный простор для тактических манёвров.

Вторая особенность PA - колоссальные масштабы боёв. Как говорят сами разработчики, они хотели отодвинуть микроменеджмент на второй план, так что вместо отдельных юнитов игрок управляет целыми армиями, редко состоящими менее, чем из пары сотен юнитов. Когда в таких знаковых играх как Warcraft/Starcraft игроку приходится заботиться о добром здравии каждого солдата, здесь это не нужно, да и, в общем-то, совершенно невозможно. Это отнюдь не значит, что вся стратегия сводится к построению большого количества войск, обведению их рамочкой и нажатию ПКМ на вражескую базу; такой подход, скорее всего, приведёт вас к полному уничтожению. Тут же стоит упомянуть, что, несмотря на необходимость отрисовывать сразу огромное количество боевых единиц, игра выглядит довольно симпатично; разумеется, модельки не слишком высокополигональны, да и текстуры не как в Crysis, но, благодаря великолепному дизайну, это совершенно не бросается в глаза.

Третья отличительная черта Планетарной Аннигиляции - межпланетарный и орбитальный геймплей. Как я упоминал раньше, полем боя может являться целая солнечная система из 2-5 планет каждая из которых открыта для колонизации. Выиграть битву, всю игру оставаясь на одной лишь планете, практически невозможно, ведь освоение новых земель позволяет вам в разы увеличить приток ресурсов, а также даёт вам дополнительный путь отступления в случае, если что-то вдруг пойдёт не по плану. Перемещение между планетами происходит либо с помощью орбитальных юнитов, либо с помощью порталов (которые сперва необходимо построить, а для этого также требуется либо транспорт, либо орбитальный строитель).

И, наконец, четвёртая основная особенность - это, собственно говоря, планетарная аннигиляция. Игроку позволяется уничтожать целые планеты, эффектно и мощно заканчивая игру. Вы можете построить на луне двигатели, сдвинуть её с орбиты и столкнуть с планетой, вызывая колоссальные разрушения, или же (на некоторых картах) воспользоваться Катализатором - местной вариацией Звезды Смерти. Что первый, что второй вариант требуют огромного вливания средств и времени, так что вам придётся хорошо потрудиться, чтобы осуществить один из них. Не стоит забывать, что и противник не станет сидеть сложа руки и покорно ждать своего конца; враги будут всячески мешать вам претворить свои планы в жизнь, так что будьте готовы вести боевые действия сразу на нескольких планетах.

В результате, Planetary Annihilation - это инновационная РТС, осмелюсь даже предположить, что это первая РТС следующего поколения, вводящая сразу несколько нигде ранее не виданных идей, главной из которых, на мой взгляд, являются сферические карты. Возможно, такой подход скоро станет классическим, хотя мне и не верится, что поклонники и разработчики стратегий в скором времени откажутся от привычных плоских карт... В любом случае, если вы ищете чего-нибудь нового в этом старом жанре, вам определённо стоит приглядеться к Планетарной Аннигиляции, вполне вероятно, это - именно то, что вам нужно. | Hello Commander,

Il est temps de produire un rapport dévaluation à 500 heures de jeu passées.


Concernant les aspects positifs :

-Gameplay dynamique
-Choix stratégiques multiples
-Cartes de jeu multiples à 360° 
-Simple à prendre en main
-Editeur de cartes
-Système d'équipes appréciable et original


Concernant les aspects négatifs :

-Une réalisation qui peine à avancer
-Un nombre élevé de bugs
-Un éventail de construction en jeu qui peine à évoluer
-Des fonctions techniques comme le Social ou les Lobby manquant d'optimisation


Pour synthétiser :

Un jeu prometteur aux aspects originaux dont la réalisation se fait attendre. Nul besoin d'en faire une description complète puisque certains fan sites ou encore d'autres community hubs l'ont fait. Il est important de souligner la grande originalité de ce jeu, au travers des aspects très appréciés des joueurs comme les cartes à 360°. Originalité qui ne manque pas de s'inscrire dans l'identité de Total Annihilation grâce à son style artistique et la manière dont le joueur évolue au sein des parties. Par ailleurs, l'engouement des joueurs se porte davantage sur ce qui va être réalisé que sur ce qui est déjà réalisé.

En conclusion, une communauté impatiente de découvrir un Planetary Annihilation finalisé. Un enthousiasme qui connait quelques déceptions et à juste titre. Ce sont plus de 2,000,000 $ collectés pour le lancement du jeu dont la réalisation était initialement prévue pour fin 2013. Six mois plus tard, il est consternant de constater un Lobby qui n'est toujours pas optimisé mettant à rude épreuve la patience des joueurs. Ne parlons pas des bugs connus en jeu et non résolus depuis des mois. Pour compenser tout cela les développeurs ont implanté ""The Galactic War Single Player"" ce qu'ils appellent une ""Big Rock feature"". Mais on ne remplace pas le sel par le poivre, surtout que la Galactic War ne propose qu'une évolution linéaire et monotone de votre conquête : déplacement banal sur la carte de campagne, un ""Tech tree"" qui porte plus sur une restriction qu'une extension de vos technologies, une IA en difficulté maximale qui se plie à votre volonté en moins de 10 minutes. Planetary Annihilation a une base de jeu solide mais qui ne saurait tarder à céder sous le poids d'un éventuel laxisme de la part des développeurs.

Bien à tous, 

Narah. | (EDIT: This review has been quite popular [Thanks for that, by the way], and I feel that in the interest of fairness I should mention that I have not played the Titans expansion, and I'm not going to, such is my dissappointment with this game. But it does perhaps bypass some of the problems I have raised here, I just don't particularly want to waste my money on it.)

I wanted so much to love this game. I'm a huge SupCom and TA fan, and this game looked like it was going to be the game that I was playing every day for the next couple of years. But after a while things were starting to look pretty bad, I came back online for the first time in a while to see if things have picked up. The game is still a very bland and repetetive experience. As an RTS all of the authentic strategy is in the first 5 minutes of each game, and then it's just who can push the most build capacity.

Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is, in my opinion, the best RTS game ever made. It's basic mechanics are excellent, the need for map control, economy management, unit management, tech management and intel are all closely interdependent, meaning that you're always INVOLVED in the battlefield even during the ""quiet"" stretches of gameplay. The available maps are excellent, and if you play on Forged Alliance Forever, a community maintained lobby with a competetive 1v1 ladder and public match service for casual players, there are stacks more to download. The game was also beautiful, with a good spread of aesthetically and strategically unique factions from the bread and butter ""space marines"" UEF, the intel oriented guerillas Cybran, the overrun focussed Aeon, and the tech heavy Seraphim. The game progression from opening to endgame is multifaceted and calls for real-time responses to your opponenents activity. To this day after 5 years of playing Forged Alliance if anybody tells me they're looking to get into a new competetive game I tell them to get FA. Similar things can be said of Total Annihilation, PA's other direct predecessor.

PA takes the ""massive-scale"" RTS format, and turns the format into an (ironically) incredibly two-dimensional experience. The units are bland and there is no faction diversity, the game escalates quickly but when it gets to its peak it tends to degenerate into a massive drag, especially across multiple planets with player interaction at a minimum, with power plays limited to a very uninteresting blob vs blob. Defensive plays just don't mean much in this game after a point. Your point defence investments will be thrown out for the sake of producing ever more units in the ongoing drudgery that is the endless escalation in this game. It sounds and is pretty cool the first few times you play it, but then you have your 10th game, and you realise you're doing more or less the same thing you did in the last 9, except there's a lava planet in this system, cool! But aside from your units not being able to drive over lakes of lava, that means very little. it's just forced no mans land. Interplanetary warfare epitomizes this. Build lots of orbital defences, build lots of fighters and send them at your opponents defences, wait 5 minutes for the fleet to arrive, hope it works, maybe send some fabricators to teleport an army from your planet to that one. I've done it so many times and I just don't really want to any more.

Huge scope for escalation in an RTS is cool, but you can't build a game on sheer escalation, which is what this is. There is no nuance, deploying a small force well is almost never going to make a game-changing difference, to the point where it's not worth trying, better stick to what you know. The learning curve is too steep as it is to try subtle strategies as a new player, and once you get to grips with the game you realise that there is very little to be done outside of beating your opponent in an arms race.

The game was released unready, and is just generally a very poor execution of a great concept, centred around a gimmick which doesn't come into play that often. My one hope for the game is that some modders come along and take the good (but extremely temperamental) engine and inject some life into it, the elements are there, but Uber half assed it, and just made the most nondescript RTS they could, and then made it really big and really long... and really fucking boring. | You want to know about Planetary Annihilation?

First, Uber shit in their community's collective faces by abandoning Planetary Annihilation as a bug-ridden, incomplete piece of garbage further made up of disappointment and empty promises. 

Second, they removed Planetary Annihilation from the Steam store entirely, further signalling their abandonment of the game, while simultaneously releasing their new full-price repackaging of the same game with the updates and content you always wanted (Planetary Annihilation: TITANS).

Third, after months of nothing but negative reviews and angry backlash from their community, they've inexplicably READDED the original Planetary Annihilation to Steam...For almost the same price as their repackaged game with more content!

Up and coming developers take note: THIS IS HOW YOU DON'T MAKE A GAME.

Curious potential buyers take note: Don't buy this game. There is the possibility of course that you might glean a couple hours of entertainment from it, but in the end it won't be worth the waste of your money or time. If you want a good RTS to play, pick up Starcraft 2 and its expansions, or Greygoo, or Company of Heroes, or Endless Legend. Just don't buy this game, Uber doesn't deserve your money. If I still haven't convinced you and you're still determined to try it, don't waste your money. Pirate this piece of trash instead. | Remember Rome: Total War? Taking over a continent with large scale armies was great. Watching hundreds of arrows arching into a tightly packed phalanx, breaking it up just before the distracting charge from your Swordsmen forced them out of position so your Cavalry could break through the side. What a game. 

I believe this is the next best thing. In terms of scale, it is crazy! Most matches have the potential to see orbital engagements, with Commander units fleeing the battle torn main planet in search of refuge. A nearby moon makes for a better base than the distant planet. Once secure, the moon is turned into a war factory, pumping out robots and tanks into a teleporter to be fed back into the foothold left on the starting planet. Then, just as your waves and waves of units seem to be breaking the enemy line of defense, they nuke your teleporter and push you completely off the planet! 

But all is not lost... You move every construction unit into the production of Halleys - giant rockets that can move small planets out of orbit... All the while inter-planetary nukes harass your anti-nuke defense and orbital units flood into your atmosphere trying to break through. But you manage to hold on just long enough to finish building your Moon of Doom, and it is time to quickly flee with your commander to the unoccupied planet. 

Now comes the fun as your push the moon into a new orbit of the sun; one which intersects with the orbit of the home planet - now riddled with machines of war, eager to break out and destroy you. However, without a foothold on the moon, nor an attempt at collonising the distant planet, your enemy has no where to go, and can only watch as a multi million ton projectile, hurled through space, smashes into his base, obliterating the planet, triggering the destruction of their Commander unit, and knocking them out of the game.

Yeah it's fun :D I just need someone to play with :(

Multiplayer is where it is at, as unlike most strategy games, you can play as the same colour, sharing controlling of the same units, as well as team up. What's more, unique game modes like 1v3v3v3 can be played due to the dedicated servers, whereby the aim of the game is to knock out the solo player who has a production bonus. Almost like a race to break into the fortress!

76561197970698176,243160,Mushroom 11,0.0,"Action, Adventure, Indie",0,"This game is honestly pretty cool! The premise of being this slime creature that moves and shapes itself with the mouse is a neat idea and how it plays out in most of the levels are a blast. I always kinda like the idea of becoming some goo monster in a video game that fiddles around with puzzles and getting into a bizzare atmosphere with fungi and decay of an old civilization of the past.

The gameplay was fun for the most part but however there were many parts in the game that felt way too annoying with how some of the puzzles played out. Some required some decent thinking while others felt as if you had to mess around until something worked and that could be both good and bad (Mostly bad). Most don't really tell you what to do nor give you any hints, so you had to mostly wander around and jumble until something worked. Ikinda wished there was a better way in taking some of the puzzles and either simplifying it or give the player a little stool to help them. I'm not saying to make the puzzles easy, I just felt that some asked for a little too much time and effort  to pass (especially the purple dot puzzles on every level).

The world building was also cool too. Granted, it is set in this post apocalyptic world where mankind went extinct and now the whole world is crumbling down with the surviving lifeforms conquering the world, a concept that has been done to DEATH alot in stories. However, I did like finding little hints of how society was before and how it lead to it's downfall but I kinda felt there should be more to explain the whole story. Most of it left like some big puzzle that was only 60% completed and not enough was being told. Either it was the devs plan to not reveal too much to lead to creative theories online or what, it was still fun.

The music was also good too. it felt very fitting with each level and I don't think I have any complaints with it. It did it's job and it did it fine. 

To end it: It was good. I still felt like the puzzles needed to be adjusted a bit but i still found the game fun.
I give it a 7.9/10",I really liked this game. It was fun and the puzzles were a bit too difficult. I liked the music and the game.
76561197970698176,241600,Rogue Legacy,5.783333333333333,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG",8,"Fun Fact: This game actually coined the term ""Roguelite"", to describe Roguelike elements while not actually fitting into the mold of the genre, which is actually a set of rules determined by Roguelike developers of yore in an event called the ""Berlin Convention"". This game is most-assuredly not an actual Roguelike, which is why ""Rogue-LITE"" is used in the marketing material, because it was a brand new term and style of game at the time.

Most games people call ""Roguelikes"" don't actually meet the real criteria, and this has been a source of annoyance for actual Roguelike fans like me for over a decade, since the Roguelite boom, which this game is partially responsible for along with Binding of Isaac. I like Roguelites a lot, this isn't a slight against the genre, but people SERIOUSLY need to distinguish them better.

If you want to know what a real Roguelike looks like, the Genesis game Fatal Labyrinth, the Game Gear version Dragon Crystal, Nethack, Caves of Qud, Angband, Path of Achra, Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead, Quasimorph, Tales of the Maj'Eyal, ADOM, why yes I did just skim Sseth's channel to remember half of these names.

I actually grew up with the 3DS VC version of Dragon Crystal and the PS3 Genesis disc that had Fatal Labyrinth on it. Although, gonna be honest, I played more Dragon Crystal, and when I was playing the PS3 Genesis disc, I was playing Shinobi 3 and Streets of Rage 2, a true classic. That reminds me though, the stellar Phantasy Star 1-4 was also on that disc, and also, the PS2 Shinobi reboot and it's sequel Nightshade are actually peak, despite getting sub-par reviews for the time. Time was very kind to those games despite their insane difficulty, and I don't think I'll have another opportunity to mention those games unless Sega puts them on Steam or something.

Less faithful to the original criteria, but still great examples are the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games, the other Mystery Dungeon spinoffs, and also Shiren The Wanderer by the same team, which has 2 releases on Steam. Also another strange example of a Roguelike is FF X-2 Last Mission, a pack-in on the HD releases of FF X+X-2, in case getting the previously PAL/JP-only vastly superior re-release version of FF X with 14 extra bosses and a better, much more open, Sphere Grid wasn't enough of a bonus.

Rogue Legacy is a very good Roguelite, and it still holds up. As you can see by my playtime, this game was a staple for me in high school, and I still come back to this game and it's sequel. The ""Neo"" fights in this game are entirely unbalanced, but otherwise this game is very, very good. The Donation Box was a new feature to make the ""Neo"" fights less crushing, and it does help a lot, but the big problem is a lot of the Neo fights require playing against your play-style. The equivalents in the sequel are much better, since instead of having set strategies you're required to learn, it's a test of how well you can clear them as each class.

Class dichotomy is also not as good in this game as in it's sequel, and the disabilities provide no compensation like in the sequel. Rogue Legacy 2 is definitely a better game, but that doesn't mean this game is BAD. After all, the sequel came out 7 years later, and hindsight is 20/20. For a while, this was one of the best 2D Roguelites out there, before we got Dead Cells, which I played extremely late, and this game still has plenty of really good ideas, even if it has some design flaws.

A lot of those design flaws really don't become apparent until you've already beaten the game and are on NG+++, so in that regard, Cellar Door succeeded at making a sufficiently well-designed game. Also, as a bonus, Cellar Door included a copy of a fan-made overhaul mod, Lament of Zors, to the game, with permission, as an alternative launch option, and that fan-made mod is very interesting and adds a lot of new areas to the game, and rebalances a lot.

In short, the sequel is a better game, but this is still a great game to come back to, even with the sequel existing. I recommend this game wholeheartedly. I know half the text here ended up talking about other games, and the distinction between Roguelite and Roguelike, but there's not really too much to say about this game itself other than that it's a well-designed action platformer responsible for the Roguelite boom. | Mon temps de jeu parle de lui-même. 
Au fil des années, Rogue Legacy est devenu un de mes jeux conforts. Quand j'avais un petit moment, et pas envie de me lancer dans une grande aventure, je relançais une run, souvent deux, trois, quatre, car le Rogue-Like est spécialement addictif.

Из под их крыла выходили игры разных жанров, иногда причудливо смешанных. (с) писал я про Ego Draconis.

Это же касается и Dragon Commander, которая представляет из себя смесь визуальной новеллы с 4х-стратегией и даже полноценной RTS, а также с легкими нотками авиасимулятора!
Если немного упростить, то это Story-driven версия игр серии Total War. Задача игрока - захватить весь архипелаг, страну за страной, попутно принимая какие-то политические решения, влияющие на отношение населения и добычу ресурсов.

И эти политические решения - самое интересное, что есть в игре. Условно они делятся на 2 вида: взаимооотношения с советниками и с женой.
К сожалению, не все из 7 рас Ривеллона добрались до релиза игры (хотя, судя по концепт-артам, они были в планах). В качестве советников не выступают представители Орков, а в жены нельзя взять еще и представительницу Импов.

Все действия разделены на условные дни: 
- Общаемся со всеми помощниками и советниками. Принимаем какие-то решения.
- Улучшаем навыки дракона и исследуем улучшения для войск
- Передвигаем армию по глобальной карте
- Проводим локальные бои
- Читаем новости в газете.

Larian известны своим юмором, но в этой игре, кажется, он достигает пика абсурдности! Каждая раса - совершенно карикатурное представление какого-то актуального громкого движения.
Почти каждый ход на голосование выносятся вопросы типа ""разрешить ли однополые браки"", ""дать ли право голоса женщинам нежити"", ""обложить церковь налогом или нет"" и т.д. У всех этих решений есть последствия. Во-первых, не всем расам понравится решения игрока, во-вторых, в зависимости от выбора пойдет сюжетная ветка и следующие голосования, а в-третьих, результаты будут опубликованы в местной газете.
Причем изложены они будут в классическом формате ""Ученый изнасиловал журналиста"" - факты вывернуты наизнанку, а любые действия игрока будут поданы с негативной стороны.

В какой-то момент появится возможность выбрать себе в жены представительницу одной из рас. Это откроет дополнительные ветки развития событий, и тоже повлечет за собой какие-то последствия.

За пререканиями советников так забавно наблюдать, что я бы даже перепрошел игру, чтобы увидеть все варианты развития событий. Но не хочется душиться об RTS часть.

К слову о ней. Если 4х на глобальной карте еще достаточно увлекательно играется, то локальные сражения с прямым управлением вызывают только разочарование. Они аналогичны высадкам на планеты в Космических Рейнджерах. Но там подобные сражения были необязательными, но при этом игрались довольно увлекательно.
Здесь же сразу возникает ощущение, что разработчики не заходили в свою игру - настолько неудобное здесь управление камерой и юнитами.
Даже возможность превратиться в дракона не добавляет разнообразия. В итоге я старался по максимуму использовать автоматический расчет боев. Благо он есть.

Итог.
Dragon Commander - отличное развлечение на 1-2 вечера. Возможность узнать, что случилось после Ego Draconis, как развивалась история мира, встретить знакомых персонажей и поучаствовать в знаковом для лора событии. И всё это под узнаваемую сказочную музыку Кирилла Покровского. | Good",

*minor spoilers ahead*
Each floor is a randomized module so every time you start the game, it won't be the same run. The rooms will be similar but placed in different orders, It is roguelike there is no saving. there is checkpoints though for completing floors.
You start off barricaded with a starter pistol , rdx bombs , and empty cans for armor. (other gear if you have the die more edition) and navigate thru 10 levels full of mutants, zombies, AI robots, and much more. There is no music, only the ambient sounds of the world and monsters. You can craft items, all items are color coded, White is Weapons / Blue is Heath / Red is Explosives / Yellow is Utilities /  Orange is Ammunition. The arena mode is helpful to gain practice for the main story. 
All floors contain two secret rooms (sometimes 1-3) . They are necessary to find for endgame.. Look for cracks in the wall Shoot them a few times don't use explosives. By midway you'll start encountering boss fights, be mindful entering a room as it will lock behind you for the fight. By level 3 you will start to encounter enemy swarms so be careful walking near open pipes.
There is a bug where there are logs around the ship that you are able to read pressin space. Sometimes you will not be able to exit the readin prompt, causin a softlock , but I found pressing the return key (<=== key that is also enter) will fix this issue and return control to the player. 
Beware if you plan on buying. 
This game isn't for casuals, theres a little less than 1k reviews for this game. Only 2.0% of owners even complete it, 
Only 4% making it halfway to the 1st boss fight. that's less than 50 people. You will die ALOT!!!
If you wanna survive, knife as much as you can for the first 2 levels. asap craft a nailgun and a detector. By level 4 you will need armor. Only use healing items if you will receive the full effect, and find all the secret rooms !!! GLHF! 

If you have epilepsy or seizures I would advise not to play this. At the start and end of each level you are met with a quick strobe of lights, during heavy gunfights it can strobe as well. | look at this guy over in the dark tryna find some canned meat.

A bit grindy on first playthrough but progresses much faster on NG+. I enjoy it despite having played the later CSD games and appreciating their different mechanical approaches to the same dishes and events, and I don't think the three games are truly redundant. The game is written much more seriously overall than the later games as well, though that's saying surprisingly little and ultimately the story is inconsequential here.

Game is soundly assembled and balanced and all the dishes are worth consideration. You will build a lot of keyboard APM playing this game and memorizing combos for further optimizations, though I know of those who prefer joystick controls and are nonetheless quite skilled. 

Everything looks and sounds delicious, and almost inspiring, for drawings and exaggerated sound clips but yeah a lot of recipes get oversimplified. You're going to be cooking entire lasagnas and entire pots of soup for individual patrons. I recommend that you don't buy blue stars until you beat the game. | [i]Cook, Serve, Delicious![/i] in one word: FAAASTERRR

This game is full of keyboard action and plays a lot like those niche typing games. But instead of reading and typing words, you're reading dish orders and inputting corresponding hotkeys at blistering pace and superb accuracy. And yes, you can customize hotkeys for all the dishes, which is pretty sweet. However, there are some notable limitations: the key to serve a dish has to be Enter, and you can only use letters, so [];',. etc. aren't allowed.

Every day that you do well, you get ""buzz"", i.e. the game speeds up. There's no significant bonus related to this other than that you get more customers and earn more money. Most importantly, it makes the game speed fit your skill level. So this is just good game design.

The game also has great humor. If you stay a bit in the intro, you get people saying Cook, Serve, Delicious in every way possible. The e-mails you receive every day are full of character and humor as well.

All that is to say, these developers really know what they're doing, and I look forward to getting 100% for this game! | It's funny going back how much simpler this is than its sequels
Not that that's bad | Very fun and enjoyable typing game, that makes good use of ingenious mechanics to add complexity to an otherwise simple concept. I especially liked how some recipes created a different flow on the keyboard, while presenting unique challenges you had to overcome. 

(I only played on extreme so the experience might be different on normal)

Pros:
- simple and easy to navigate UI (there are some weird menu interactions like how you have to go to the ""View/Buy Foods"" tab to test recipes, but there aren't that many and you get used to it)
- straightforward gameplay that also needs a bit of strategy to play well
- good humor
- music
- diverse and fun recipe cards
- challenging (I wouldn't say it's especially hard but you need to be able to touch type to have a good time)
- not annoying to get all achievements

Cons:
- a few annoying bugs (mostly in the UI)
- becomes repetitive after a while (especially the final star rating)
- difficulty is somewhat inverse if you play on extreme because you don't have any upgrades in the beginning
 - you can't discard a dish to redo it if you failed (its annoying when you miss a perfect day because your hand slipped and added the wrong ingredient in a single soup from like 100+ orders) | A very fun game. It can get a little dull when you have low buzz and consequently very few customers, then the next day you'll be mashing keys like crazy to get through a mad rush. Cool music and overall a great experience.",This game is a great way to learn how to cook. It's a great game for the whole family.

Gold Edition is a hollow attempt to merge Metroidvania with Mexican folklore, resulting in a mismatched cacophony of mediocrity wrapped in a garish, Day of the Dead-themed wrapper.

The combat is as repetitive as it is uninspired, relying on a tired combination of button-mashing and awkward platforming segments that feel more like punishment than challenge. The so-called 'luchador aesthetic' is little more than a gimmick, dressing up a shallow experience in flashy tights to distract from its lack of substance.

Worse yet, the constant barrage of meme references and self-aware nods to other games feels like the developers were more interested in fishing for internet brownie points than creating a unique, engaging experience.

Bom, esta é a primeira vez que jogo um Sid Meier. E tenho que admitir que, contra minhas expectativas, fui positivamente surpreendido.
Além de seguir acontecimentos reais, o jogo oferece várias possibilidades e estratégias. Além do mais, mesmo sendo totalmente leigo, como é meu caso, ele é bastante intuitivo, mesmo se depois leva tempo para dominar.
Ao mesmo que oferece diversão, oferece desafios para todos os gostos.
Da próxima vez darei mais bola para um jogo da franquia.

Permadeath is super annoying in a co-op. Losing all your progress and then playing through the exact same dungeon again is super demotivating. We tried playing with infinite lives, but then it trivialized the game -- there was no penalty at all for death.

Also, the fact that every player controls every menu simultaneously led to a let of misclicks. My partner opened a vendor while I was attacking things, and my button press bought something for them. Worse, later they paused the game while I was attacking things, and my button press quit the game. There wasn't even an ""are you sure?"" dialog, it just immediately quit and we lost everything. This tipped it into thumbs down for me. | es ist ein tolles spiel das mich meine ganze Kindheit begleitet hat ich rate euch das Spiel zu kaufen !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | A campanha principal é um dos melhores Dungeon Crawleres que eu já joguei, só que depois que saiu o Heroes deu pra ver que a mecânica é bem limitada.

76561197970698176,239350,Spelunky,2.3,Indie,2,"this game has genuinely been a part of my life for over a decade, i used to play it on xbox 360, and now i play it whenever im bored, or feeling down, etc.  genuinely an endlessly repayable gem, i recommend. | Spelunky is an absolute gem of a roguelike, combining tight platforming, brutal difficulty, and endless replayability into an experience that never gets old. The randomly generated levels ensure that no two runs are ever the same, keeping each playthrough fresh and unpredictable. The variety of tile sets adds a sense of adventure, making every descent into the caves, jungles, and temples feel like an entirely new challenge.

The difficulty is steep, but that’s part of what makes Spelunky so rewarding. Every mistake is a learning experience, and every victory feels well-earned. The game demands precision, patience, and strategic thinking, turning even the smallest progress into a thrill.

The music and sound design perfectly complement the gameplay, with catchy tunes that shift dynamically between calm exploration and high-stakes escape sequences. And when it comes to replayability, Spelunky is nearly unmatched—there’s always a new way to approach the caves, a new secret to uncover, or another challenge to conquer.

Gameplay: 9.5/10 – Tight controls, deep mechanics, and rewarding difficulty.
Graphics: 7.5/10 – Simple but charming visuals that prioritize clarity and function.
Sound/Music: 8.5/10 – Atmospheric and fitting, enhancing the tension and adventure.
Replayability: 10/10 – Infinite variety with randomized levels and tons of secrets.
Overall: 9/10 – A near-perfect roguelike experience that rewards skill, patience, and perseverance. | Spelunky ist meiner Meinung nach ein perfektes Beispiel für ein gut durchdachtes Jump & Run Spiel.

Es gibt unzählig viel zu erkunden und zu entdecken, allerdings muss ich sagen das Spelunky 2 diese Aspekte sehr stark verbessert hat.

Auch wenn Sterben einen ziemlichen Rückschlag bedeutet, gibt es Momente wo selbst der Tot einem Spaß bringt.

Ich selber hatte einen großen Spaß bei diesem Spiel und würde es besonders für Freunde von Spielen wie Mario herzlichst empfehlen.

Müsst ihr wissen!
 | Spelunky is a very fun game to just pick up and get a few rounds in. The constantly changing map always guarantees a unique experience. This game is hard, but it's not ridiculous and you can easily get better. It's a great game to play with others as well, as the controls and concept are very simple. There's not a whole lot to it, but it is a great way to pass 15 or 20 minutes here and there. 8/10 | в этой игре можно бить негра который будет копать тебе шахту, и женщин... игра конечно же стоит своих денег","Spelunky 2 is a perfect example of a good Jump & Run game.

I will definitely replay but is not meant for everyone. At the time of release I could see the price being too high but after ten years any story lover should check it out. | Pretty good but very predictable by the midpoint. You can tell this was one of the first walking sims because Firewatch, the beginner's guide and Edith Finch went on to blow it out of the water | I originally bought this game because I thought it was another short horror game. I was then in a 2 hour long story about the ups and downs of a family, specifically their teenage daughter Sam and her relationship with a girl named Lonnie. 

I have never cared about the relationships of fictional characters before I had played this game, its perfect use of letters, diary entries voiced by Sam and environmental story-telling gripped me from start to finish. | the game is nothing special by today's standards, everything it does has been done better by other games. however, if you're like me and interested in games as an artform, and the evolution of said artform, definitely give this a shot. this is one of the first walking sims as far as i know, and you can see its influence in many other games after playing.

also there is a sub-story that changes the whole tone of the game if you manage to notice it, so that's nice. | I found this very immersive. I loved the creepy atmosphere (which thankfully never became scary) and exploring to uncover the story - there was a good sense of onward momentum and new discoveries that changed my perspective on the story up until the end. There were lots of enjoyable details and the 90s nostalgia was a big bonus for me.","...as a horror game, it's a good one. But it's not for everyone."
76561197970698176,249590,Teslagrad,0.0,Indie,0,"Conceptually nice, but controls felt a bit weird. The boss fights were really frustrating and felt unpolished. | I love a lot of aspects about this game. Its music is nice, the art work is great, and many of the puzzles are really well put together. The tools and mechanics feel fun and interesting.

I want to love this game, as there is a lot to love about it. However, you far too often you end up with a puzzle that requires you to wait around for a very long time, then sudden you have to do a series of very fast and tight movements, or you will have to do the whole puzzle over again. That would be fine, if your character didn't have ridiculous loves of acceleration and deceleration at times when it doesn't make sense. Often times when you think you are safe, you are not, and your feet are coated in a thick layer of high grade american butter, resulting in you slipping off of things that you really should not have.

Another sour point for me are the boss battles. They are very creative, but their very nature of being a puzzle based boss battle, and one hit you die, you end you replaying the first parts of the boss battle over and over and over and over. I will admit that I am not the best plat former, or puzzle solver, but whole crap does it get old doing the same thing so many times just to get 1 more chance to trying something new in the puzzle, only for it to no work and its back to the slog.

There is probably an interesting story in there, I found a lot of collectibles that showed a lot of things, and there are these theaters that you come across that show you story stuff, but after spending so much time having to redo so much game content just to move a little bit forward, I stopped caring. And I no longer have any drive to finish the game.

This game will scratch an itch for a specific type of gamer and will get a lot of enjoyment out of it, but care to much about my free time keep bashing my head against arbitrary brick walls. | Не претендую здесь на объективность (как в других моих обзорах), ибо с самого начала был к игре предвзят, так как не люблю платформеры и головоломки. Как несложно догадаться, Teslagrad на 99% состоит из этих двух жанров.

Игра очень медленная, очень нерасторопная. Головоломки и платформинг душноватый. В головоломках ещё не понравилось то, что здесь недостаточно решить их, надо ещё и правильно исполнить это решение. Я считаю и буду считать, что такого быть не должно. Эталонные головоломки должны проходиться в момент, когда ты нашёл решение.

Здесь же бывает такое, что ты нашёл вроде как правильный ответ, но тебе надо ещё и дополнительно его исполнить (быстро пропрыгать, например). Проблема в том, что если ты не сможешь с первого раза исполнить, что от тебя хочет игра, ты попадаешь в ступор, когда не понимаешь, это изначально у тебя идея решения головоломки неправильная, или ты просто не достаточно хорошо прожал кнопки.

На первом боссе так вообще у меня большая часть попыток ушла на то, чтобы понять, что он делает и что игра хочет, чтобы сделал я.

Ну и по мелочи: сюжет вроде обычный (хотя я наиграл лишь 40 минут, возможно дальше будет интересно, но начало не интригует), графика так себе (даже с учётом скидки на 2013 год и инди разработчика).

Но опять же, возможно, если вы фанат этих жанров, то концепция с магнетизмом вам придётся по душе, и вам будет интересно проходить эту игру. | I love it","I'm not sure if I'm a fan of the game, but I'm not sure I'm a fan of the controls."
76561197970698176,249650,Unknown,1.0,,1,"Was mir gefallen hat: 
Story 
Allgemeines Setting des Games 
Alter Grafik Stil 
Integrierbarkeit in Gesprächen
Es gab viele Möglichkeiten was man skillen kann z.b  Talente, Waffen, Zauber, und und und 

Was mir gar nicht gefallen hat: 
Wenig Erkunden möglich 
Der Unterschied der Schwierigkeit von Level zu Level 
Das Kampfsystem
Für mich ging es nicht wirklich um Taktik in diesem Game
Das ist vergleichbar mit XCOM. Du stehst vor dem Gegner und triffst ihn nicht. Ich hatte meinen Zwerg auf 2 Händer geskillt, juckt dem Game aber nicht. Bei einer 85% Chance trifft er 4 mal hintereinander nicht. Bei einer 20% Chance dann aufeinmal. 

 Es ist völlig Random und das sterben ist vorprogrammiert. 

Im Trailer haben Sie schon in Bereichen des 1 Kapitels die krassesten Zaubersprüche.
Ich hatte weder genug Gold um mir diese zu kaufen (weil es vorgegeben ist was zu tun ist) weder konnte ich welche finden. 
Man muss da rum eiern mit den billo Sprüchen und es kommen immer stärkere Gegner. Die hätten das Spiel in Fick Simulator umbenennen sollen. 

Ich hatte im ersten Kapitel NICHT EINE Möglichkeit für meinen Zauberer Main einen Zauberstab zu kaufen. Und den 1 den man gefunden hat, der hat 2 MANA im KOMPLETTEN ZUG regeneriert ( zum Heilen braucht man 5) 
Und close Combat sind es dann 2 Schaden die du verursachst, wenn der Gegner 24 Leben hat weißt ja was dabei rum kommt. 
Ich hätte meinen Zauberer auf eine andere Klasse skillen müssen, was einfach nicht gebockt hätte. 

250 Gold für 1 Zauberbuch ist die fetteste Wucher, pro Mission bekamst du maximal 2-3 Gold 
Und du kannst ja nicht mal viel erkunden, bedeutet du kannst dir keinen Nebenverdienst einholen.

Graphics/Art Direction:
- Graphics are fairly middling, which I don't find to be an issue considering this is a budget game, but I didn't feel graphics were so bad as to distract from an enjoyable experience
- Things that makes up for the lack of AAA graphics is the fact that almost every NPC has their own portrait work, and I really liked the portraits, each city has a beautiful artistic backdrop that is varied and makes it feel like you really are traveling a varied world environment with different cultures and people, and man of the monster designs were very well done, creating a lot of variability and fun without falling into the tropes many develops chase after like grotesqueties with teeth and eyes coming out of every orifice: I love Fromsoft enemy design but many developers that copy this miss the point completely.

Gameplay/Game Mechanics:
- The hex based combat system can be a bit slow, though I like tactical games, so this is something you should consider before buying. What I really liked is that environmental variety in combat. Every stage is hand crafted and has a completely different look and feel. There are constantly interactive elements within the combat environment including switches, puzzles, exploding barrels, falling chandeliers, holes to cover to stop enemies from respawning, traps, exploding swamp gas, mud holes, enemies can slip on water, etc., and this adds a lot of depth and variety to the game as no single battle ever really feels the same. 
- Gear can unfortunately feel a bit basic and lacks visual flare and variety. While most weapon types are very different in how they are used, the skills tend to fall sort of flat and are not very visually entertaining. Additionally, while you do find stronger weapons and armor, none of it really makes you feel like your character looks cool or becomes powerful. Even the rare and unique stuff I have found looks pretty generic. This is one area I would have liked to see improved
- The overworld is a map and you select a location which moves the cursor to the location, reminiscent of older PC games, SMT IV, and so on, which is not very compelling unfortunately. This makes it sort of hard to remember what city or location you have already been to and can make navigation a bit confusing. This is compounded by the fact that the quest system tends to provide very menial direction and that overworld locations are frequently added and easily missed if you are not viewing the map regularly. 
- Many people do not like hand holding, but without a guide you are likely to miss a lot of sidequests, and this game has a lot of side quests to do. The problem is that each side quest is actually fairly compelling including dialogue from companions, unique locations and battles, and is the way to obtain most of the unique or rare gear in the game. I cannot say if any of this is permanently missable, but a bit more direction would have been helpful as I found the content of sidequests to be worth doing and did not like having to enter towns repeatedly to talk to people to see if a new quest may come up. Overall, if you're creating a compelling world to explore, and individually designed levels for every combat scenario, provide additional direction to help me find it all so I can experience it. Many people may not find this to be an issue, but when you get to a new region of the game, you may have 10 - 15 towns that open all at the same time, and this can be a bit tedious and confusing without added direction

Story/Character:
- I actually really like the story and characters. Scenarios and characters are well written and well voices, each character has a personality that feels multi-dimensional versus being a caricature like in many games, and they have interesting things to say in most scenarios. This is probably one of the only games I have played where your party is truly morally grey. You party up with a drug addict at one point for example: have to say that is the first for me. 

Final Score: 7.5 - 8.0 (I would say 7.5 for gameplay and 8.0 for the story/characters)

Pros:
- Interesting world setting with compelling well written and voiced companions
- Beautiful and varied portrait work that distinguishes even generic enemies
- Cities are varied and interesting with beautiful backgrounds offering a unique feel to each region and city you visit
- Interesting battle scenarios that are each custom built for a unique experience including interactive objects that have direct impact on the tactical aspects of the game and can be used to your advantage - or against you if you are not careful
- Many sidequests that are varied and meaningful to complete

Cons:
- Overworld map is very minimal
- Gear tends to be underwhelming in appearance 
- Skills, while varied, are not vary interesting to visualize

Overall, if you are skeptical/unsure, I highly recommend this game if you enjoy character driven stories with challenging and fun tactical combat. While a budget title, I honestly feel this game is underrated and likely dose not get the attention it deserves, despite the obvious love and effort that went into making nearly every scenario, character, and combat scenario feel fresh and different. | За что столько наград? Даже на то время.
Ни тогда не осилил эту игру и в этом году у финала дропнул, не интересно жиесть. | This is bad in that, ""We don't know how to make a game challenging, so we just send massive hordes of overpowered enemies at you repeatedly"", way.  I really tried to power through and finish this thing.  The world is interesting and the premise of the story is good, but the writing is predictable and the game is just....bad.  I will say that some of the voice actors are surprisingly solid.  But only some.  I have the sequel too and I'm not even gonna bother trying to finish this and play that.  I'll be removing them from my steam library to remove the temptation of trying again.  I do hope they keep trying and do something better down the road, but woof.",
76561197970698176,250520,UnderRail,149.35,"Indie, RPG",35,"Wrote this with just under 90 hours on the clock. Restarted a few times in the early stages of the game, but am ultimately over it after reaching level 18 and spending most of the time exploring.
Still don't feel like I've made much progress, despite this, given the expansive scope of the game.
Unless you're a die-hard Fallout 1/2 fan, it really isn't worth getting into.

Cons

Meta save scumming simulator. You will likely spend 60% of the game save scumming.

The game is an unforgiving time sink.
Power build or die. Either spend a bunch of time deciding which build to use specifically beforehand by looking up existing builds online, or don't play at all.
Misplaced a skill point or perk? Too bad. Reload or start an entirely new game.

You can look forward to investing an hour into damn near every battle - save scumming like you have nothing better to play.

You'll be micro managing every little thing with no backup or party mechanics whatsoever. The fact that you are sent out to deal with absolutely everything on your own is utter, laughable bollocks.

You'll be spamming a lot of grenades (and save scumming when you miss).
Unless your build allows you to put points into the Throwing skill, you'll be lobbing them 20 meters in the damn-near opposite direction as if you have cerebral palsy.

The inventory system is a pain in the ass.
Managing item weight is a massive hindrance. Given the scope of the areas to traverse, and lack of meaningful fast travel aside from boats, you'll be spending half of the game encumbered while you ferry loot around.

Most of the loot you'll find is garbage that you won't be able to use unless your build makes use of the crafting skills.

The traders are anal-retentive with regards to what they will or will not purchase from you, and how many of those desired items you can actually sell. It renders most of that loot-ferrying and hoarding as meaningless. I understand the need to limit the player's purchasing power so as to keep economy relevant, but you don't have a lot of good purchase options anyway.

Unless you've played before and know where everything is and exactly what you're doing, or you're following a walkthrough (lame), you'll have to spend probably 100+ hours to get anywhere meaningful in the game.

The old-school isometric style of the game, as nostalgic as it is, can make navigation and clicking on things a hassle unless you're holding tab like 60% of the time.

You can't speed up the game while even lightly encumbered. Gotta keep the player moving at a snails' pace to boost them play time numbers.

The initiative system is stupid. If you are in stealth mode, and attack an enemy despite not having been spotted at all on approach, there's every likelihood that your attack is nixed and they get their turns first (more opportunities for save scumming, yay!).  You can't use burst/automatic gunfire from out of stealth, either.

The quests are boring.

The game is, ultimately, boring.

Somewhat modernized old-school isometric style | A game made by a developer that goes out of his way to prevent people from having fun with his game.

I purchased this at release back in 2015 and put it down due to some pretty unpleasant game design choices hoping it would be better balanced with more development, a decade later I finally decided to give it a proper go and I really wish It had.  

Instead the developer has actively been patching the game to prevent modding, or altering the game in any way shape or form.

Old school games were not like this, not at all.

 | Pros - Game reminds me of Fallout and old school Shadowrun. Very much one for the nostalgia minded set.
Cons - Very unforgiving gameplay even on normal difficulty. If you haven't played it before my recommendation is to specialize and not spread your stats or skill points too much around. Also, there's no general fast travel, which gets annoying later on in the game. | The game was tedious at first but I learned to absolutely love it after some hours! The map is huge, yet never felt like its filled with fillers, every corner has a story or a surprise, or at least something to do. The leveling system makes sure u never get too OP. The story makes a full use of the game mechanics, never repetitive. 

One thing they could improve is adding a way to reassign leveling points, in no way I'm going to replay the past 10 hours to fix my initial fuckup ): u gotta max certain things to do what u want in ur playthrough, and it'll be too late when u finally figure out what u actually need. Other than that, good game. | good game. needs lots of gaming experience or heavy use of youtube/wikis/etc.. 
the more you learn, probably this game becomes more addictive.",I'm not sure what the game is about. It's a meta save scumming simulator. It's a game that's a waste of time. It's a waste of time. It's a waste of time. It's a waste of time. It's a waste of time. It's a waste of time. It's a waste of time. It's a waste of time. It's a waste of time. It's a waste of time. It's a waste of time.

Ich habe das Spiel nun schon seit einiger Zeit in der aktuellen Betaversion gespielt und ich muss sagen, es funktioniert bereits wunderbar als das, was es sein soll. Nämlich als kurzweiliger Haudraufspaß im Multiplayerformat.

Es gibt eine Menge Charaktere mit unterschiedlichen Stärken und Schwächen, wobei jeder Charakter nochmal sein eigenes Set aus jeweils vier Spezialfähigkeiten besitzt. Daraus (und aus den Charakterspezifischen Attributen) lässt sich dann auch die Spielweise schlussfolgern. Es sind genretypisch alle Charakterarten vertreten, es gibt Tanks, Damage Dealer (Nah- und Fernkampf), Healer und Supporter. Allerdings sind viele Charaktere sehr vielseitig, so dass man nicht zwangsläufig an die jeweilige Ausrichtung gebunden ist. Das belebt den Multiplayer sehr, denn so können Spielergruppen, die theoretisch aus vier mal demselben Charakter bestehen, dennoch recht gut vorankommen und sich gegenseitig unterstützen. 
Um mit den wirklich fiesen Bossen gut klar zu kommen oder im PVP am längeren Hebel zu sitzen, ist eine halbwegs ausgeglichene, sich ergänzende Gruppe allerdings notwendig. Das klappt mal mehr oder weniger gut, aufgrund des Matchmaking-Systems werden Spielergruppen einfach aus im Moment spielbereiten Mitspielern zusammengewürfelt. Man hat also keine Möglichkeit, sich eine Party auszusuchen (man kann natürlich Steam-Freunde, die das Spiel besitzen, in seine Party einladen). Das ist allerdings auch nicht wirklich schlimm, da das primäre Ziel des Spiels schnelle, kurze und fordernde Kämpfe sind. Somit ist das Matchmakingsystem denke ich die beste Wahl, schnell eine Gruppe zu finden und sofort loszulegen.

Die Spielmodi und Maps sind momentan noch sehr überschaubar, da wird sich mit der Zeit aber sicherlich noch einiges tun. Auch fällt es zurzeit mitunter sehr schwer, ein ""Scavenger""-Match (PVP) zu finden. Scheinbar spielen die meisten noch eher PVE. Das macht viel Spaß und wird nie langweilig, da sich die Mitspieler (und Gegner) dem eigenen Charakterlevel anpassen. Dennoch wird die Abwechslung dadurch noch zusätzlich etwas geschwächt. Doch das Spiel befindet sich ja wie bereits erwähnt in der Betaphase und man merkt schon, dass sich stetig hier und da etwas verbessert. Und bis jetzt läuft es schonmal sehr gut.

Man darf kein besonders kompliziertes Spiel erwarten. DIE ist einfach ein spaßiges, buntes Mulitplayer Hack 'n Slay und als das funktioniert es blendend. Man kann sich immer mal wieder zwischendurch einloggen und ein kurzes Spiel bestreiten (meistens dauert ein Spiel nicht länger als 10-15 Minuten).

Der Pay2Win-Faktor hält sich sehr in Grenzen. Die zusätzlichen Charaktere lassen sich auf Free2Play-Ebene nur mit erheblichem Zeitaufwand freispielen und auch die besseren Waffen fordern einiges an Spielzeit ein, um gekauft werden zu können. Jedoch sind die Waffenunterschiede zumindest im momentanen Stadium nicht wirklich ein Siegesfaktor, es kommt eher auf den effektiven Einsatz der Charakterfähigkeiten an und natürlich auf das gute alte, stupide Draufhauen!
Man kommt auch mit dem Startcharakter sehr weit und bis man den auf der maximalen Stufe hat, kann man sich locker schon einen neuen freispielen. Es dauert halt alles ein bisschen. Aber hey, ist es nicht das was Spiele ausmachen soll? Immerhin will ich ja auch Langzeitmotivation und wenn ich mir alles am ersten Tag per Echtgeld freispielen würde, hätte ich nicht mehr wirklich viel, auf das ich hinarbeiten könnte. Was jetzt natürlich niemanden daran hindern soll, ein paar Kröten für DIE auszugeben. Ich habe mir das ""Patient Zero"" - Pack gekauft und ich denke da ist so ziemlich alles drin, um mit dem Spiel für eine ganze Menge Zeit Spaß zu haben ohne das Gefühl zu haben, ohne zusätzliche Ausgaben etwas zu verpassen oder gar zu vermissen. Und von irgendwas müssen die Entwickler ja auch bezahlt werden, um das Spiel noch besser zu machen. :-)

Lange Rede, kurzer Sinn: DIE macht sehr viel Spaß. Und wenn man sich mit dem Genre anfreunden kann oder nach dem ein oder anderen Let's Play neugierig geworden ist, dem kann ich nur empfehlen, dem Spiel eine Chance zu geben! | No real Contents update since 4 months ago.
about 90% of the player base have left the game,

RIP epidemic! thx for the 800hrs of fun we had together! | Ну что-же, пожалуй я созрел для написания обзора к этой игре. Итог подведу ниже, поэтому кому не интересно читать + и -, просто листаем вниз, а теперь о собственно них самых:

Плюсы:

1) Лично мне приятная графика и интерфейс, это не некстген, но и не режет глаз, сделано в стиле средней мультяшности, нормальная оптимизация, есть дополнительные настройки HUD и всяких плюшек, типа автопрокачки скиллов и отображения кд кувырка.
2) Приятное WASD управление и камера, которую можно залочить на персонажа или сделать чуть более свободной (увеличенный обзор в сторону наведения курсора)
3) Довольно много персонажей с интересными скиллами, некоторые явно позаимствованы из других игр, но большинство всё-же авторских.
4) Rag-doll трупиков и механика работы скиллов радует, они ведут себя так как должны.
5) Количество оружия, перков и модификаций выносит мозг, за все проведённые в игре часы я так и не выбил всё оружие (ящики не использовал).
6) Донат не кусается, т.к. всё, что можно купить за донат, так же легко можно получить в обычном бою.
7) 3-ая сторона конфликта в виде зомбаков — смотрится довольно интересно, никогда не бывает недостаточно врагов на карте.

Минусы:

1) Нынешняя русская локализация на уровне Фаргуса.
2) До сих пор нету режима 5v5, а в него ой как хочется сыграть, спустя год наблюдений за тупорылыми командами, которые слившись на первой минуте в одном замесе, выбирают себе цель до конца игры — убить именно твою команду, а на победу уже как то и пофиг.
3) В последнее время множество игроков жалуются на постоянные фризы в игре, а решение вроде как до сих пор нет (у меня нет ни лагов ни фризов, но довольно мощный компьютер).
4) Количество оружия, перков и модификация действительно выносит мозг.
5) Донат не кусает тех игроков, кто играл в эту игру как и я, с ЗБТ или ранее, т.к. нам выдали довольно много плюшек в связи с изменениями в игре. Для большинства игроков нынешнее количество очков персонажей за бой — абсурд.
6) В некотором роде наблюдается чуть пофигистическое отношение разработчиков, прежде всего потому, что на специальной сайте для тизеров, до сих пор висит персонаж, которого ввели ещё 2 месяца назад. Тоже самое с обновлениями на офф. сайте, большинство обновлений можно прочеcть только в обсуждениях в сообществе.

В итоге, как и в любую командную игру, в DI:E — лучше играть с друзьями. Однако, пока нету режима 5v5, это отнюдь не означает тотальное анигилирование, т.к. 2 команды могут внезапно решить, что им намного важнее размесить вас, а не выиграть игру. Если вам повезёт и вы с первого раза купите персонажа, за которого вам действительно нравится играть, то покупка остальных на долго не затянется. Если разработчики в ближайшем будущем исправят фризы у 70% игроков, добавят 5v5 режим и хотя-бы на процентов 30% поднимут дроп очков персонажей, то игра для меня снова станет интересной, т.к. в команде можно будет побеждать или проигрывать в зависимости от скилла команды, а мои непрокаченные друзья перестанут вайнить после каждого боя о хреновом дропе. | Genre - Horror Isometric MOBA/Action Survival
I love all of the Dead Island Games, Diablo, Gauntlet and am a very casual DOTA 2 gamer. I think this game works well as a F2P as it is possible to farm points while still enjoying the game to unlock characters. I got the starter pack when it was on sale so got 4 characters to choose from and enough points to get more. Weapons can be crafted and are upgraded via use. This happens between games, and unlike DOTA 2 you actually get some character progression to carry over. You still level up within game but you will have added perks, more inventory and better weapons. None of which messes with the balance too much but adds a little bit more to come back to. You will either play horde, basically 4 player survival mode (where death means more time taken and a worse medal) or scavenger where three teams of four basically play capture the flag with zombies. Both these modes are fun, although it would be nice if they could think of at least one more balanced mode for variety's sake. I did have a problem where I got some extra character points incorrectly (their fault), and then them and the character I bought were removed. This wasn't my fault and seemed a bit harsh. As yet I haven't had a satisfactory response Despite of this though I still came back for more though, which with my grudge bearing temperament says a lot about the actual game! | Je refaçonne mon évaluation après la sortie de la version 0.3 (jeu en closed beta)

Alors deja super jeu, reprenant des élements de la franchise des dead island. Donc au menu du fracassage de zombie, de la récolte de provisions et de la tuerie de zombies...  Avec pour plaire a tout le monde, un mode de jeu pvp et un mode de jeu pve.

Pour le coté pvp, le Scavenger mode, ou la fouille par chez nous :

3 équipes de 4 joueurs s'affrontent sur différentes map, afin de récupérer des provisions (supply) et remplir leur véhicule. Puis de réussir a s'enfuir avec le butin en premier. 
Les provisions peuvent être récupérer en prenant le controle de points spéciaux, qu'il faut défendre contre des zombies et assauts des autres équipes. Ou alors aller tuer des gros zombies spéciaux lors d'event popant aléatoirement sur la carte.  Aussi en fin de partie, l'on peut tenter de voler les provisions directement dans la base ennemie...

Tout cela donne droit a des nombreuses stratégies, et on retrouve des mécanismes habituels tel que le stun, le dot, le spike, les lags, ha oups... Actuellement on peut croiser 14 persos différents se qui donne pas mal de possibilité. Vraiment un mode maitrisé et disposant d'évolutions a l'écoute des joueurs !


Pour le coté pve, ou mode horde:

Une équipe de 4 joueurs parcours une carte, en prenant des points de controle et les défendants contre des vagues de zombie. Pour finir, par affronter l'un des gros boss dans son antre. Un mode sympa pour évoluer ces perso ou les découvrir. Une difficulté correcte avec le système de récompense en fonction du temps. 

De plus, une fois le compte lvl 4, on débloque le mode horde héroique ! Et la, c'est une toute autre histoire, des zombies élites et massifs en pagaille, des océans de chair pourrie et de crânes explosés.

Quelques points sur le jeu en général:

-une quinzaine de personnages actuellement
-les effets quand les zombies meurent sont top (feu, acide, glace, explosion)
-de super musiques !
-plein de sang et d'effets quand on tappe du zombie
-des centaines d'armes a crafter
-prise de niveaux pour le compte, les persos et les armes
-des graphismes qui tiennent la route
-tourne super bien et les rares bugs vitent corrigés

Pour conclure, je rajouterais qu'il existe un système ""d'infection"" lors du lancement de chaques parties (pvp comme pve) qui influe sur la difficulté du jeu. Donc refaire, une partie sur la même map et avec la même équipe, peut apporter son lot de surprise avec l'augmentation de l'infection. (par exemple, infection 7 en pvp on se tappe des zombie elite et spéciaux en masse avant la première barricade et avant d'avoir vu qui que se soit ^^ )

Un jeu a avoir si l'on aime tapper sur des zombies et un pvp fun !!!","I have played this game in the beta version and I must say it works well. It is a short-lived game in the Multiplayer format. There are a lot of characters with different strengths and weaknesses, but each character has its own set of four specific abilities. This makes the game very fun, because players can play with the characters that are thematically the same, but they are still able to play together. This is a very good game, because it is a quick, quick and demanding game. The game mods and maps are very easy to find, because it is very easy to find a group of players and then play them."

[b][u]Go Go Pixel Rangers![/u][/b]

Die Kämpfe in Chroma Squad finden [b]rundenweise auf einem rasterbasierten Schlachtfeld[/b] statt. Gegner und Helden machen abwechselnd ihren Zug. Hierbei sind die Helden stets die ersten. Sowohl Gegner als auch Helden haben spezifische [b]Eigenschaften[/b] wie Laufweite und ein spezifisches Skillset, das bei den Helden durch deren Ausrüstung und Klasse bestimmt wird. Oft kommt auch der obligatorische [b]Riesenrobo[/b] zum Einsatz, wenn der Boss nach der ersten Tracht Prügel über sich hinauswächst. Hier kommt ein Combosystem zum Einsatz, das einen (theoretisch unendlich oft) mit wachsender Kraft angreifen lässt. Allerdings wird es immer schwerer einen Treffer zu landen, da das Zeitfenster für das Timing immer kleiner wird. Abschlussangriffe beenden die Combo zwar, werden aber immer stärker je nach dem wie viele Treffer die Combo beinhaltet. Ein Mal zu verfehlen bedeutet natürlich, dass die Combo endet und mitunter Kontert der Schurke dann auch noch, bevor er einen Angriff startet.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3409282712


[b][u]Echte Helden brauchen keine Level-Ups? Ist das dann noch ein RPG?[/u][/b]

In Croma Squad gibt es keine Level-Ups für das Vertrimmen von möglichst vielen Gegnern. Stattdessen werden mit jedem Kapitel zwei oder drei neue [b]Skills[/b] freigeschaltet, aus denen man wählen kann. Jeder Held hat einen eigenen Skillbaum. Klassische RPG Mechaniken finden sich hier keine.


[u][b]Gut gekauft ist besser als schlecht selbst gebastelt[/b][/u]

Zwischendurch werden die Streiter der Erde stärker durch [b]Ausrüsung[/b], sei sie nun gekauft oder gebastelt. In der Regel ist die gekaufte allerdings besser, weil Ressourcen teils knapp sind und teuer in [b]""Mystery Boxen""[/b] (Random Items) nachgekauft werden müssen und weil selbst gemachte Ausrüstung oft zufällige Eigenschaften hat. Für die Aufrüstung des [b]Riesenrobos[/b] gibt es nichts zu kaufen, aber die Eigenschaften der Bauteile ist vorgegeben und es stehen pro Körperteil drei Baureihen zur Auswahl.


[b][u]Teamwork und Effekte weil Einschaltquoten[/u][/b] 

Da die Kämpfe (zumindest Anfangs und für das Publikum) nur Schau sind und die eigene Arbeit von den [b]Einschaltquoten[/b] abhängt, muss man dem Zuschauer auch etwas bieten. So werden Spezialangriffe und Teamangriffe auch gern mal völlig unnötig gegen Kanonenfutter entfesselt und Teamkameraden abenteuerlich durch die Gegend geworfen, um den Zuschauer zu begeistern. Auch [b]Regieanweisungen[/b] spielen eine Rolle. Diese sind optionale Ziele wie etwa den Boss in jeder Runde mit einem spezifischen Charakter angreifen oder mal eben drei Gegner in einer Runde außer Gefecht setzen. Alles für die Einschaltquoten, denn diese resultieren am ""Ende der Folge"" in Geld und Fans.

[b][u]Die Ökonomie des Schowgeschäfts[/u][/b]

Die Welt zu retten ist mitunter schweineteuer, also muss das süße Geld fließen. Das erreicht man durch Einschaltquoten. Vom Geld kauft man dann neue Ausrüstung und rüstet den Riesenrobo auf. Einen weniger direkten aber nicht zu unschätzenden Nutzen haben [b]Marketingagenturen[/b], die mit ihren verschiedenen Perks das Einkommen, die gewonnenen Fans oder auch Kampfwerte der Helden aufmotzen. Perks werden durch [b]Fan-Energie[/b] freigeschaltet, die man zusammen mit Fans bekommt.

[list][*] Nur ein Spielstand pro Studio, weshalb man um die verschiedenen Enden freizuschalten jedes Mal von Anfang an spielen muss.
[*] Der (vor) letzte Boss ist künstlich erschwert.
[spoiler]Er spawnt ehemalige Bosse, von denen einer einen AOE beherrscht, der allen Helden schadet und im Nahkampf auch gegen Gruppen stark ist und einen Boss, der konstant in der Lage ist, andere Mobs zu spawnen. Der Hauptgegner kann obendrein Helden quer durch die Arena treten, beherrscht einen starken AOE und und kann während er die anderen Bosse beschwört einen Rundumangriff starten, der die Gruppe verstreut.[/spoiler] Dagegen ist der letzte Boss ein Kindergeburtstag.
[*] Was man sich beim Craftingsystem gedacht hat, ist mir ein Rätsel. Man hat BEGRENZTE Materialien, welche man zwar nachkaufen kann, aber auch nur in Form von ""Mystery-Boxes"" (zufällige Auswahl bestimmter Materialien) und Geld ist, bedingt durch die Begrenzte Menge an ""Missionen"", auch nur begrenzt vorhanden. Das gemeinsam mit einem Craftingsystem, in dem RNG-Kram eine große Rolle spielt stößt mich persönlich schon sehr ab. [/list]


[h1]Schwierigkeitsgrad[/h1]

Der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist in verschiedenen Stufen zu Beginn des Spiels einstellbar. Auf ""Mittel"" ist das Spiel seicht herausfordernd, ohne zu schwer zu sein. Außer der (vor) letzte Boss. 


[h1]Soundtrack, Grafik, Steuerung[/h1]

Der Soundtrack ist ziemlich gut gemacht und fängt den Charme des Settings einer Super Sentai Simulation gut ein. 
Die Grafik ist recht hochwertige Pixeloptik. 
Für die Steuerung wird die Maus benutzt.

[*] Skillset der Rangers ohne zusätzliche Kosten variabel 
[*] Strategisch anspruchsvoll ohne zu schwer zu sein [/list]

[b]Fazit:[/b]

Chroma Squad ist eine humorvolle Hommage an das ""Super Sentai""- Genre, dessen bekanntester Ableger im europäischen Raum ""Power Rangers"" mich durch einen Teil meiner Kindheit begleitet hat, weshalb dieses Spiel ein Muss für mich war. Fans des Genre oder solche, die Erinnerungen damit verknüpfen sowie Freunde von Runden-Strategie. können hier zugreifen. Wer sich ein RPG mit Level-Ups und offener Welt erhofft, wird enttäuscht. Von mir gibt es eine Kaufempfehlung

It seems like the game has gotten worst with every version released in the last 3 years. It seems like the developers look at what players are doing and then deem it exploitative or just don't like it in general and change it. To summarize it, they don't like how the players are playing their game and they want them to play it how they (devs) want them to play it.
We went from alpha 12 creating sand molds for glass jars to now as of b25, no glass jars or containers or anything and want you to die of thirst on day one. We use to build underground and be safe, devs didn't like that and now the zombies dig. We then built air forts or off-ground bases, devs didn't like that and added physics to the blocks and coded zombies to attack the nearest support pillar to force collapse.
You use to build a small structure or clear and rehab a point of interest as a starting base after scouting for ones with forges or being near water. Devs didn't like that and now Poi's are deadly, and sometimes spawn zoms inside after placing your land claim block or bedroll. They marketed the game as a crafting survival game, but now have made it difficult to build and craft and forces you to loot all the time. 
You use to eat once and drink 3-4 times a day, devs didn't like that and now You're constantly starving and thirsty all the time. In alpha 12, you use to read books to unlock crafting or recipes and magazines to increase skills, the devs didn't like that and thought a skill point system would be better. They took the book/mags out in alpha 13-18 then reintroduced it in 19 to co-exist with the skill-point system, but now in b25, you need the books and mags to level up for everything.
You use to heal up and regain stamina after eating or drinking, and now you just a weak ass bitch, since food doesn't recover as much health and water is sparse. They cut down or remove quite bit of assets and gameplay from the game to simplify it and I think that has detracted from the game from it's earlier versions.
Now the fun pimps don't like the stealth mechanic and have null and negate it in the latest version.
That's just a fraction of the evolving changes. The game used to be pretty fun to now being such a total grind and chore, that I can't even stand it for 30 minutes before I quit out. 

I know what you're thinking, I'm complaining about how hardcore and difficult then contradict myself with them simplifying crafting and assets. But if you ever play the earlier versions, it wasn't as much of chore then as more of a realism and understanding basic build process, and it was quite fun. There was more to do. Going ""oh I need sand and clay, I need a jar for the mold, I need a forge, some metal or an anvil"" and put it all together to get 5 glass jars. Then I need water, pot and campfire. It was all obtainable and you had to manage it and it made it felt like you were trying to survive. 

Now it's like, you have to loot and get lucky, Do about 30 hits on a tree, block or door and now you're thirsty because you've exhausted your stamina repeatedly, so don't run or swing your club and avoid zombies, and hope you find water. It's a walking simulator with a looting mechanic. That's just bad game design. 

The Fun Pimps are not so fun, I think they are pure masochists that enjoy C&B Torture and they are making this game for those that enjoy that type of fetish. | 7 Days to Die is a great game, but any recommendation I could give it is inherently a bit double-edged because I genuinely think it was a better game last year. Just about everything I like about its foundation is still there; it's a survival crafting game that manages to be fully voxel-based and destructible without looking the part, with an emphasis less on exploring randomly generated terrain and more on exploring structures that are randomly placed but hand-made, with each one feeling like a fun mini-dungeon hiding its own little surprises. There's plenty of content, plenty to build, and it lasts a long time before getting old. I spent a long time playing it via gamepass before coming back to put 50 more hours into it with my usual group for 1.0, and we had a good time doing it. But by the end of it, we all had our own complaints as well. The problem with the 1.0 changes aren't that they ruined the game, so much as that they change it ever so slightly into a different type of game than the one we came to it for; it's like right at the end of development someone on the team played an ARPG and had an epiphany. 

Most of the changes feel like they were made for people who have been playing the game for thousands of hours and just want to grind efficiently, rather than new players just wanting to explore and play the game with fresh eyes. A minor example of this is the trader system; in the previous versions, any of the game's different vendors could show up anywhere, and it was possible to get lucky and find towns with two different ones in the area. In 1.0 we eventually moved into a town that had three traders, which was pretty exciting until I realized they were all Trader Hugh (sorry, Hugh) because of them being made biome-specific. You can obviously guess why they did this. For people who already know the game and just want to get going, it takes a lot of the guess work out of finding a trader of a certain type they might need to start optimally instead of having to wander for ages looking for one with a bit of bad luck. But for normal people, those sorts of experiences are practically a cornerstone of the genre; survival crafting games are all about generating funny stories caused by the randomness, and I feel like probably everyone that's ever played one has at least one memory of searching for ages for something and how good it felt when they finally stumbled across it or finding something they didn't even know was in the game after finishing it multiple times. Yeah, it can be frustrating in the moment, but that's why it's called ""survival"" crafting, not vacation crafting. Get real, man.

The last time I played this game, there was a clothing system that, while not necessarily robust, had a nice amount of variety, as well as minor gameplay elements. You could loot funny hats and put together outfits, customize your character's looks without worrying about stats, and dress for the weather. This has all been replaced with various sets of armor and a promise of re-adding it about a year later. You can still mix and match pieces of armor, and in some ways it can even be preferable with their individual effects, but each set also has a set bonus that encourages you to just wear a full set instead of dressing up the way you want to. Some of the funny items like cigars are still in the game, but only as accessories you equip to your gear with no visual change. And that's adequate -- at least there are still options, and while I wish there were more armor sets they at least look pretty unique -- but it just feels arbitrary, even mechanically. If you went into a snow biome from the start before, your character would end up freezing pretty quickly if you didn't have warm clothes to layer up with, and my first memory of such a thing was spending a night huddled by a campfire in a house surrounded by bears. Which is fun! I love having moments like those in these games. I went there in 1.0 fairly early on expecting to relive the memory, and found that because I had crafted basically any armor set at all I was already above the threshold of the weather doing anything more than a very minor stamina debuff. Why even bother?

But the thing that pisses me off the most is that despite its stat focus, the last time I played the game it did a good job of keeping the progression separate from the gameplay, so that you could comfortably specialize no matter what you chose to do as long as you were killing zombies and generally doing something. There were books you could find that gave unique and fun bonus traits, which are still there, but for the most part you were free to do whatever you wanted without feeling like you were lagging behind anyone you were playing with. In the current build, the entire system has been changed so that nothing really matters except the magazines you've read. Want to make better guns? Read 100 handgun magazines. Want to make better clothes? Without reading 100 issues of Fashion Weekly? C'mon, let's be serious! Nearly every crafting skill in the game now has 100 arbitrary points you have to raise by reading that many magazines (yes, yes, give or take 20 or so if you wear the nerd outfit, sue me geeksquad), and it's as tiring as you'd expect. Unless, of course, you do quests -- which are now basically the only viable way to progress even remotely smoothly, because of how often they reward you with loot boxes full of an assortment of magazines that are usually guided to what you're trying to level. And this, hundreds of words later, is my core problem with the new update. It doesn't matter if you want to loot, if you want to farm, if you just want to kill zombies; if you're not doing quests, you will burn out of the game long before you finish any crafting tree, to the point that it feels actively detrimental to just go out and explore on your own. Even the vendors themselves have been heavily nerfed to the point that most of their inventory is completely arbitrary in favor of the things you can craft at a given time, with their only lingering purpose being selling junk and occasionally buying things you're just too lazy to go find. Which would be fine, if the trader didn't still constantly get hung up on sending you to the same three or four buildings per quest tier or try to send you to Tilted Towers 6,000 meters away if your towns don't generate just right.

I'm sure some poindexter with 10,000 hours in the game is going to come into my comments like ""erm, ackshually, the changes added a sense of balance that was greatly desired for the pvp experience"", to which I say come at me because I am simply morally superior and way cooler. And despite my complaints, I do still maintain that it is still fun. But the reason behind my great american novel is to give context for the bottom line: is it worth $45? No. I mean, I don't even have to think about it, honestly. When I bought it the game was $25, and I thought that was a fair price then and it's still a fair price now. $45 is frankly a crack pipe price for it in its current state, especially given that it rocketed up that $20 with no meaningful changes from the previous build. But they have a lengthy roadmap listing out things that should have been in anything called ""1.0"", like bringing back the wardrobe system, adding in bandits, and even story content and new quests, which all sound like excellent ideas. If those end up coming to pass and don't get stripped down after 10 more years of rebalancing then I think the current price tag would be more justified. For now, just wait for a sale and don't be afraid to look into a few mods. | 新版本更新后联机总是出现各种各样的问题。每次和朋友玩都是为了连接服务器花大量时间，往往还没开始正式玩就累了。 | 毎日過ごす中でなんかこうゾンビ倒したいなぁ、拠点作りたいなぁって

76561197970698176,252070,Gimbal,0.0,"Action, Indie",0,"Gimbal, is a nice looking 2D space shooter that has a lot going on underneath the hood. At first glance it looks like one of many ordinary space shoot'em up games, but as soon as you unlock the so called hangar option a new dimension opens up.
Within the hangar players are able to construct their own personal space fighter to do battle on one of the many maps. With each level progression the player unlocks new parts which become available at the hangar screen.

Much, if not most, of Gimbal's power is due to this feature and sometimes you're spending more time construting and tweaking your ship than actually playing a map.

The maps which are at your disposal are okay and look nice. Each map comes in 2 versions: normal and mini.

Another good thing about Gimbal is the option to host your own server, add bots to it (This allows for Co-Op and solo play) and to adjust almost any setting to your liking.

Controls are another league of their own. I haven't seen that many games that allow for just ""You got a key, button or axis to use? press, jiggle it."" That's a very nice feauture, because with the many weapons and construction options at your disposal, controlling that killer ship can become a science of its own.

But, it's not all sunschine with Gimbal, it actually has one huge flaw. And that's the level cap. First of all there're just a hadful of levels/ranks you can gain: about 4. And as a result you're pretty soon done gaining ranks and earning parts. Which is another downer for Gimbal. Although the hangar is just the thing to use, you soon realise that it's not perfect. There're not enough parts. With a game as Gimbal you want 1000 and more parts, 200+ weapon choices and so one and so one. You don't just want to build fighters. You want to construct a Star Destroyer... Not gonna happen, not allowed.
True, it's a lot of work to creat a game with such options, I won't deny that, but a game like Gimbal needs at least some modding support so players can add their own parts and designs. Without that option its life span is rather short.

On the other hand, with the low price tag you can't go wrong with Gimbal.
All things work just perfect, no bugs, just not enough construction parts in the end. | First off i want to say this is one of the most fun games i've played.

Gimbal is a top-down, high-atmospheric (or space) game in which you build ships to destroy other ships. The ships are fully customizable. There are many maps and gamemodes to try.

You start off with $1500T and you earn more by destroying ships. When you reach a certain amount of money you rank up and unlock new parts to build with. Once you hit $6000T you can reset back down (you can only do this once) and after you get past $6000T again you unlock ""MasterMind mode"". This is where you can have as much money as you can get, there is no cap.

For now it isn't a very active game, so once you reach mastermind it can get boring, because the bots cap at $6000T and you 1 shot all of them. If anybody is on the servers though (which there is usually at least 2 people on for now) it is a lot more fun.

The developer listens to everybody, and tries to add in anything that is suggested. There is a very good forum where you can talk about anything in the game. There is a very good community, most people are nice.

That is pretty much it, I highly recommend the game to anybody. | This game is an incredible combination of fast paced combat and detailed ship design.  

Combat:
Combat is fun and, at times, thrilling.  Some imbalances exist, especially on the ""newb"" servers-but there isn't anything that       skill and design can't overcome.  The design of your ships will have a major impact on how you fight.  Build a hulking tank?  You won't be moving much, and will probably need a turret to hit anything.  Build a lightning fast missle boat?  You'll be darting in and out of combat, tactically choosing when to strike, and when to retreat for repairs.  Controls are 100% customisable and never hinder gameplay.

Design:
Ship design is deep, although slightly restrictive.  You start by choosing an airframe, essentially determining your base stats (a ""class"" if you will).  Due to some imbalances, the larger airframes are rarely used, but eventually this should be fixed.  On this base you can attach weapons, thrusters, structures, machines, and more.  Realistic(ish) physics mean the interactions between parts and the locations of your thrusters will play very important roles.  Other components are simpler, but still require careful contemplation on how to balance the monetary and spatial constraints, while maximizing combat output.

Progression:
As you play you progress through four ranks, increasing your budget with kills and wins, and unlocking new technology each rank up.  Reaching max level is not difficult, and can easily be achieved in a single day-perfect for those with less time to sink, but who still want to compete.  On the other hand, it is possible to reset your rank, gaining ""cool points"" and rejoining the newbs.  While this provides no tangible advantages, releveling can be quite fun.  You can design ships for every price range, and master flight of the weakest platforms.  Additionally, its sometimes more fun to fight with weak ships than powerhouses, as skill becomes even more important.

Multiplayer:
The game is currently focused on multiplayer, and suffers because of it.  The lack of players means only 2-3 servers are ever really full and fun.  Fortunately you can add bots to liven the game up when few people are on.  Other than a poor player base multiplayer is a smooth experience.  Hosting is easy, and provides a plethora of options affecting gameplay.  Joining is even easier, especially when connecting to the official servers.

TL;DR:
Help us out by buying the game and increasing community size!  If you're still on the fence there's a demo available on the game's website, where you'll also find the forums. | I do not make reviews often. This game is very good.

It has unlocks and progression. It has an appealing art-style and sense of scale to it. Unfortunately, the one thing it does not have is a player base. At this current time, there are nine servers running, with a combined total of twelve players. The best match I could make was a 3v2 team deathmatch, rounded out by bots. A real shame. With a strong player count, I would recommend this.

76561197970698176,252410,SteamWorld Dig,1.4166666666666667,"Action, Adventure, Indie",3,"Игра из вселенной SteamWorld, сюжет неплохой, геймплей хороший, для тех кто любит копать, могу отметить интересные ачивки, которые воспринимаются как челленджи, есть 2 часть | I did one full playthrough that entailed mining pretty much every ore on the map, and I got every upgrade. I also got most of the achievements, excluding ones that would require another playthrough. Overall, it was pretty fun. I enjoyed it straight the way through. At first it started a bit slow, but by the end you have so many upgrades and abilities that you can just mess around with that it makes up for the slow start. I will say, earlier on, when you don't have all of the abilities, some traversal and combat feels a bit awkward and clunky, but I suppose that is a part of a lot of metroidvanias to a certain extent. 

Steamworld Dig really reminded me of a flash game called Mega Miner (all time goat of the genre by the way). I am not sure if this game was inspired by that or if it was the other way around or if they have no connection at all, but it felt insanely similar. I will say that I definitely prefer Mega Miner, and for most of the game I was just thinking ""Man, I wish I was playing Mega Miner right now."" That isn't a knock to this game necessarily, I just have a lot of nostalgia for Mega Miner, and I think that it had executed so many things perfectly (the main thing I prefered from Mega Miner over Steamworld Dig was the traversal). All that said, for a game I got on sale for $.89, it was totally worth the time and money, and I'm sure I will get around to playing the sequel sometime soon. 

The game does a good job of constantly giving you a new upgrade or ability to mess around with, and pretty much all of them were fun to use. The caves/mini-dungeons were also fun side challenges that hid some secrets for bonus rewards. I never felt myself really getting frustrated with the game, as even dying just means losing a bit of money and starting back up at the surface. You can still go back and claim your loot too.

There isn't much to say about the story, it is pretty basic, but they do set up for the sequel at the end of the game, so that had me a bit more interested in the story. 

I'd give this game a solid 6.5/10, it is a great starting point, and I am interested to see how the next game expands on it. | This game has been a lot of fun I enjoyed the exploration, the enemies, characters, the mining and all sorts this has been a really fun game worth playing if you love Metroidvanias. | Juegazo, en unas 4 horas te lo pasas tranquilamente, si quieres platinar ahi ya te vas a tardar, por otro lado, buena historia | La idea de excavar y mejorar al personaje es interesante, pero la ejecución se siente demasiado limitada.

 DON'T BUY IT IF YOU DON'T HAVE FRIENDS. | 以前の無料配布で手に入れた視聴者参加型マルチプレイ スタイリッシュ鬼ごっこ。
その直後やしばらくは人がいたが、今はもう配信してる人もいないので大人数の身内でやるのが基本。
ゲームを始めるにあたってTwitch垢でログインする必要があるので注意。

基本的に看板を持った鬼一人に対してその他がマップ上あちらこちらに落ちてるジェムと言うオーブ上のポイントをとにかく拾っていきその拾った合計ポイント数で順位を競っていくもの。
鬼は手持ちの看板で他プレイヤーを殴り飛ばすことで鬼交代となり、それまではジェム等を拾うことは出来ないのでどれだけ鬼にならずにジェムを拾い集めてポイントを集められるかが重要。
冒頭でも書いたようにただの鬼ごっこではなく、壁走りやスライディング・速く走れるブーストなどパルクール要素も含まれたスタイリッシュさがユーザーを更に楽しませてくれる。
ブーストしながらジェムを拾う事でブースト中は取得ポイントが二倍なのでそこでどれだけ稼げるかも順位に響いてくる。

また一試合ラウンド３段階に分かれていて、ラウンドごとの終了間際にサドンデスが設けられており、そこでは全員が看板を持ち誰か一人が生き残るまで殴り飛ばしていく。
ここでも一人倒すごとにボーナスポイントがあるので戦況を見極めつつ点数を稼いでいきたいところ。

今まで全員が敵状態だったこのゲームにアップデートで追加されたチーム戦「Bitball」
これが最大５対５で楽しめるルールだけどめちゃくちゃ楽しい。
このルールでは鬼は無し、だがいつもとやることは同じでとにかくジェムを稼ぐだけだが数十秒後に落ちて来るビットボールを拾って宙に浮いている四角いゴールに投げ込むというもの。
ジェムを稼いだ分だけ画面上のゲージが溜まっていき、その量に合わせて１、２、３ポイントとゴールする事で得られ、その合計ポイント数で競っていくルール。
相手が投げ飛ばす射線上に飛び込めばボールの奪い取りも出来たり、残り数秒で大逆転も有り得るので身内でやるルールとしては最高。


そしてこのゲーム最大の醍醐味である視聴者としてその試合に参加できるところ。
どういうものか簡潔に言うと、専用サイト「StreamMote」でその試合中に視聴者専用アイテムを使ってゲーム内プレイヤーの妨害をしながらビンゴを楽しむことができる。
自分たちでは貴族プレイと呼んでいて、フレンドがゲーム内でせっせとポイントを稼いでる中、視聴者専用アイテムを使って地面をマグマに変えたり常時ジャンプ状態などに視聴者側で戦況を変えられるのだ。
ゲーム所持者で視聴者側ビンゴでビンゴすればゲーム内アイテムパックが手に入ったりする。

 | Streamline is fast-paced game with 2 (technically 3, but two of them are similar) game modes. In the first one a player tries to hit all the other players with a stop sign, while everyone else collects points by doing parkour across various terrains. The second game mode is similar to quidditch in that players try to score goals with a golden ball, but they still do parkour rather than fly on brooms.

Players move very fast and rounds are full of additional effects that influence each game (chosen either randomly or by viewers' vote if the game is being streamed on twitch). Things such as the floor turning into lava, players exploding if they touch each other and the camera view rotating at disturbing angles make the gameplay diverse during each game.

Moreover, you customize your character with items gained from packs which you open out of play similarly to Hearthstone. From making your character run around in their underpants to having them wear antlers, a gas mask or a hoodie. You can even change your race and gender at any time. Also you have a taunt action which makes your charater do a little performance such as doing the chicken walk or dabbing. It's perfect for when you want want to show off while winning the game.

I got Streamline during a free weekend that was held a few months ago and I've been hooked ever since. I already reached the maximum currently available character level but don't plan on stopping. I just find it that much fun.

P.S. As mentioned above all in-game items are cosmetic, so they don't influence the player's perfomance in the game, i.e. the game is not pay2win. So only play if you've got da skillz :P",hats and hats.

Puis un jour, arriva une entreprise extrémiste pro-capitalisme, nommé Epic Games, qui décida de mettre le jeu gratuit, et changa le système des RLCS.

Les streameurs et joueurs signalent le problème horrible à Epic Games mais ces foutu chômeurs prenaient 3semaines a bannent les DDOSEURS. Puis quelque semaines après, une faille dans le jeu a été découvert afin d’être invisible pendant les parties, encore un autre problème montrant le travail HORRIBLE fait par ces extrémistes pro-capitalisme (ils ont pris 2mois a patch ce cheat et encore c'était la commu qui avaient trouvé un patch avant les developpeurs). Le DDOS était toujours pas patch, les joueurs pro en avait marre et le leaderboard n'avait plus aucun sens. Il y avait aussi le problème du wintrading (chose qui n'est toujours pas patch aujourd'hui donc n'importe qui peut être SSL s'il veut), des gens montaient des comptes a 3000MMR (j'en faisais parti honnêtement) et les serveurs de boosting utilisant le wintrade etaient de + en + nombreux. Les RLCS étaient donc de moins en moins regardé car le jeu était NUL, beaucoup de gens arrête le jeu à cause d'une dépression forte causé par Epic Games. Aujourd'hui, le 19/01/2025, le jeu est sur le bord de la fin, on a aucune idée de quand va sortir Unreal Engine 5 pour RL, et aucune bonne mise a jour sort depuis plusieurs mois.

Some friends suggested that I change my email by putting a period. For example if your address is mailrocket@gmail.com on the Epic validation website you should put mail.rocket@gmail.com

IF you are as stubborn as I am with your PC copy, here is my advice and experience: The only way I was able to get to the end without restart my save, was by running it in windows compatibility mode for Windows 98 and by frequently restarting my PC when the game would hardlock. For whatever reason, restarting your entire PC can help you get past a lot of the hardlocks.

如果说 POE2 将来可能成为最好的 ARPG，恐怖黎明现在就是最好的 ARPG。ARPG 新手可以无脑入，DLC 也全买，有 DLC 才是完整游戏。而对于 ARPG 老兵，恐怖黎明有什么特别的？

它从头到尾都尊重你的时间。

现在的赛季制 ARPG 游戏，重心都放在了终局，而低级的剧情阶段不过是走过场，好像是为了尝到终局的甜而必须吃的苦（POE2 有改进但还不够）。恐怖黎明不是。从游戏的最开始，ARPG 的两样核心，build 和 farm 就在成型了。

Build 是寻找最优解，是谜题和选择，恐怖黎明更快更多地把谜题摆在玩家面前：
- 技能点升一级不是给 1 点而是 3 点
- 镶嵌物从 5 级开始就很重要，而不像其他游戏因为需要打孔是后期内容，这里不需要打孔
- 星座相当于 POE 中的被动技能树，但有意义的大点更靠前，这些会赋予主动技能触发特效，是 Build 的基石，而在很前期就能体验到
- 加技能等级的装备和套装在前期就开始掉落，可以完全按照得到的装备来进行开荒 Build

Farm 赋予了玩家游玩的意义，POE2 和 D4 前期不会有任何 Farm，因为没有意义，前期装备非常弱，很快就要被替换。这也是这些游戏前期与后期游玩体验的割裂的原因之一，而恐怖黎明通过很多巧妙而统一的设计，让前期的 Farm 更有意义：
- 精妙的数值设计，一件 50 级的装备和终局的装备，在面板上看是两倍的数值而不是十倍或百倍，开荒期的装备保质期更长
- 一些怪物有特定掉落，这些掉落非常适合于某些 Build，甚至在终局是最好的装备
- 装备槽位多，总共 14 个，比起 D4 这些多出了护肩和勋章等部位，这意味着掉落提升角色的可能性更大
- 慷慨的掉率，独特的史诗装备和传奇装备相当于其他游戏的暗金和套装，掉得更早更多，DLC 更是提供了新的掉落途径
- 势力声望系统，Farm 至少会推进声望，而声望奖励非常优越，一方面可以直接买很好的开荒装备，另一方面终局总是需要买声望给的增辐，所以前期的 Farm 也为终局做了准备

恐怖黎明还有太多优秀之处，如手工设计的地图，塞满了奖励驱动，或是 Build 的丰富性，或是数值上的精妙，也不需要一一提及，能做好前期的 Build 和 Farm 就值得每一个 ARPG 老兵的时间。
这也不是说恐怖黎明在终局的 Build 和 Farm 就不出彩，只是我刚通第一个难度全 DLC，还没打到终局，没什么可说的。
总之推荐给每一个人，这游戏里每一秒都是值得的，在 ARPG 里很少见。 | Great ARPG with the most free choice in skill tree combinations I have seen, combine trees and you can build pretty much whatever you want. Lots of unique items to specialise things even further. No seasonal slop, no ""always online"" garbage. There is so much build potential I keep coming back again and again. There's even secret stuff for you to find.

My only gripe is after playing so many hours, I wish I had a little more bank space to store things.

还有这新dlc2023年就有消息了  2025年了 居然还没玩上 | Falo com convicção: este é o melhor ARPG isométrico da atualidade - que não está na categoria de ""jogo como serviço"" — caso contrário, Path of Exile 1 e 2 seriam ótimos concorrentes . Nem mesmo a Blizzard conseguiu entregar um ARPG à altura desde os clássicos Diablo 1 e 2. Dentre os vários pontos de destaque de Grim Dawn, eu consigo citar os seguintes:
- O sistema de combinação de classes é bem diferente, você tem ali (considerando as DLC's) 9 classes base, e podendo realizar a combinação com mais uma classe, você tem a possibilidade de criar até 44 classes;
- Habilidades e poderes trazem peso e fluidez ao combate, fazendo com que cada encontro seja satisfatório.
- A atmosfera sombria, aliada a uma narrativa rica e bem construída, me manteve engajado e curioso sobre o desfecho da história.
- Conteúdo de Endgame: Repleto de desafios, dungeons, facções e atividades para explorar, garantindo horas de diversão mesmo após finalizar a campanha principal.
- Suporte a Mods: A possibilidade de mods amplia ainda mais a rejogabilidade, permitindo aos fãs personalizar e expandir o jogo ao infinito.
- A trilha sonora ambiente é excelente e contribui muito para a atmosfera sombria do jogo, lembrando o estilo marcante de Diablo 2. 
- Já a temática se destaca por fugir do convencional entre os ARPGs, que geralmente exploram criaturas mitológicas, demônios e fantasia medieval. Grim Dawn aposta em uma ambientação inspirada na era vitoriana, com inimigos interdimensionais devastando a humanidade — é uma premissa inusitada, mas que traz uma originalidade bem-vinda. 

Não posso deixar de elogiar o cuidado da Crate Entertainment com este jogo: sem monetização abusiva, passes ou qualquer outra prática predatória, e ainda assim eles continuam atualizando o título mesmo após 8 anos de seu lançamento.

Recomendo. | Grim Dawn, desarrollado por Crate Entertainment, es un ARPG lanzado en 2016 que bebe directamente de Diablo 2 y Titan Quest. Nos mete en un mundo oscuro y apocalíptico donde la humanidad está al borde de la extinción tras un conflicto entre seres de otra dimensión. Como buen RPG de acción, nuestra tarea será saquear, mejorar habilidades y enfrentarnos a hordas de enemigos mientras descubrimos los secretos del mundo de Cairn.

Con años de actualizaciones y expansiones, Grim Dawn ha evolucionado bastante. Pero, ¿sigue siendo una alternativa real a Diablo en 2025?

✅ Lo bueno: Un ARPG profundo y adictivo
✔ Sistema de clases flexible y profundo – No eliges una clase única, sino dos, permitiendo combinaciones brutales como un soldado nigromante o un chamán pistolero. La personalización es una de sus mayores fortalezas.

✔ Loot satisfactorio y progresión bien medida – Aquí el farmeo tiene sentido. Siempre hay mejores armas y equipo, pero el equilibrio está bien llevado para que cada mejora se sienta significativa.

✔ Mundo oscuro y bien construido – No es solo un mapa por el que avanzas matando enemigos; hay historia, lore y NPCs con misiones bien diseñadas. No es un simple mata-mata sin alma.

✔ Endgame sólido – Modo New Game+, facciones, mazmorras roguelike y un montón de contenido adicional que extiende la vida útil del juego más allá de la historia principal.

✔ Expansiones que realmente valen la pena – Ashes of Malmouth y Forgotten Gods no son simples añadidos, sino mejoras sustanciales con nuevas clases, mapas y sistemas de juego.

✔ No requiere conexión online – Puedes jugar solo o en cooperativo sin necesidad de estar atado a servidores, algo que cada vez se agradece más.

❌ Lo malo: No es para todo el mundo
❌ Gráficos algo anticuados – No es feo, pero tampoco esperes efectos visuales espectaculares. Tiene su encanto, pero comparado con otros ARPG modernos, se nota la edad del motor gráfico.

❌ Combate con menos impacto que en Diablo – Si vienes de Diablo 3 o Path of Exile, notarás que el combate se siente un poco más ""blando"", con menos feedback visual y sonoro al golpear enemigos.

❌ Interface y QoL mejorables – La UI es algo arcaica y el inventario puede volverse un caos. Se echan en falta mejoras de calidad de vida en la gestión del loot.

❌ Dificultad mal balanceada en algunos tramos – Puede ser un paseo en los primeros niveles y luego pegar un pico de dificultad inesperado si no has preparado bien tu build.

🎭 Conclusión: Un ARPG para los que buscan profundidad
Si te gusta la personalización extrema, el farmeo bien medido y un mundo con historia, Grim Dawn es una joya. No es tan explosivo como Diablo 3, ni tan masivo como Path of Exile, pero tiene una identidad propia y una comunidad fiel que lo mantiene vivo.

🔹 ¿Lo recomiendo? Sí, especialmente si buscas un ARPG clásico con muchas posibilidades de personalización.
🔸 ¿Es mejor que Diablo? Depende de lo que busques. Si te gusta la profundidad y la libertad en las builds, puede que sí. Si prefieres un combate más dinámico y espectacular, no tanto.

We have to put an end to this rebellion, else our CEO overlords will nuke the city to prevent the bot rebellion from spilling over to the sterile parts of the civilization.

When we start the game, what we see is a city map, with routes to take between different points, just like the star lanes in any other tactical game with a space setting, just like in AI War for example, only that there is a city wallpaper at the background of these starlanes instead of a galaxy wallpaper. 

We only start with our own HQ at the beginning, and as I've stated before, the AI has taken over the entire city, so all the other beacons are in ""AIs control"". This looks pretty much like the galaxy map in AI War already.

On top of that, each of these beacons have a different kind of bonus to provide to the player if you choose to conquer them. And, when you conquer a beacon, more beacons on the map that you don't know about are revealed. These are pretty much the same features as in AI War 2. 

By the point I've realized this, I was a bit frustrated at how similar this game was to the AI War series, as much as I love AI War, I've expected this game to play much more differently than AI War for the difference in genre. They could have at least made the city map function more like a grid map instead of a star map, and sure enough that would have made it feel better imo; as opposed to a game that feels like a reskin of AI War in certain respects.

The overall philosophy / gameplay loop also seems to remain the same, despite the difference in gameplay genre. You have to pick your fights and choose your targets, build yourself up and weaken the enemy enough to finally go in for the kill. Though, maybe this aspect is a little bit more different than AI War in a way that it's less extreme and less punishing.

Thankfully, the similarities seemed to end there, as the main gameplay is completely different than AI War, it's a turn-based tactical action roguelike that can stand on it's own, and it has it's own fun moments. 

Ironically, one of the other nitpicks I had with the game is something that is actually different from AI War games: the personification of the AI menace seems to be comically goofy in this game, as opposed to it's terrifying presence in the AI War series.

I also wished that each player controlled mech had it's own pilot with their own skills that improved with each battle, and that if a mech was destroyed in a battle, the pilot would die, so we would have to recruit a brand new pilot and his level would have to start from the beginning, just like how it was in Into The Breach. That way, the fact that the humans are more indispensible than the countless manufactured robots would have been more emphasized in this setting, I think. Also a single person being able to pilot 4 different mechs at the same time doesn't make as much sense.

My favorite part of the game is, picking and matching different equipment for the weapons of the mechs, that way I was able to turn a missile launcher into a nuke that obliterates an entire room, it's so much fun, lol. | For a $10 game, I think I got my money's worth. | These guys make some great games.","Bionic Dues is a tactical game that is based on the Arcen-verse.

So next up in my CRPG marathon is Baldur’s Gate 2, a classic among many, and something I finally got to play through for the first time. But what did I think?

Starting off, I did play this game on story difficulty as I was mainly just interested in seeing the story through, but I will do higher difficulties when I replay this game one day. Combat is real time with pause, and it based on 2.5 edition of DnD I believe, so a little old school but I was more accustomed to the systems after playing the first game. All that said though, don’t take my thoughts on combat too seriously as like I said, I mainly played this game for the story and characters.

Visually the game looks okay but it definitely hasn’t aged that well. Obviously the graphics are going to age over time, but for me it was more just the artstyle as it’s lot of browns, greys and blacks. I say that mainly after playing through Icewind Dale, which was made on the same engine, yet it’s aged better imo in just how they used colors to vary up the locations you visited.

One cool aspect is that you get a stronghold in this game, with which stronghold you get being unique based on what class you play, which I thought was cool. That said, it's very basic and there isn’t that much stronghold management as there was in something like say Pillars of Eternity with Caed Nua. You can raise taxes to get more money, and you are supposed to get visitors but I only got 1 visitor in my whole playthrough. It was some merchant complaining about his caravans being raided by bandits, which I thought might lead to a cool quest, but no you just do the rich guy solution, which is throw gold at the problem until it goes away.

One of my main complaints from the first game was the party management, and there were just way too many companions and you realistically couldn’t recruit them all. Well they do address that here to a degree, it's not perfect but it's better then the first game for sure. For starters when you dismiss companions they will tell you where to find them, with most of them going to a specific tavern in the main city, which was a big improvement on the first game. When you get them you will get a companion quest which is timed and you do want to complete it quickly otherwise they leave your party permanently. The companion quests are very good though I must say and a big step up from the first. Some of my favorites being Jaheria’s and Nalia’s. Also if you want to go evil in a playthrough, do Dorn’s quest as it will make up for all the modern RPGs these days that DON’T let you be the bad guy. That said, this game still uses the alignment system on whether your lawful good, chaotic evil etc… This is important with companions, as I infamously found out the hard way in my BG1 playthrough where in the middle of an important story mission, 4 of my companions broke out into a fight and killed each other which still shocked me even to this day. So whenever I met a new potential companion, I had to go search them up on the BG wiki, and cross reference to see which party members they conflicted with. It got very tedious after a while and made me feel like some HR manager at a company.

Also a little mini rant about Neera. Now I had Neera in my party for most of the first game and I think she’s a fun character. She has a pretty big recruitment quest which I was going to go do, only for me to soon realize that because she’s a wild mage, she has a spell that randomly goes off in combat that literally nukes the gold out of your inventory. I had like 40k gold and after a few combat encounters, I was penniless which definitely had me steaming. Especially since you need gold for the first half of the game in order to progress the main story. You could chuck that up to old game design, but no Neera is a new companion that was added by Beamdog in this remaster, so it was just some random dev with a sick sense of humor who thought it’d be funny which I definitely don’t appreciate. Anyway, rant over.

Quests are also really good with many of them presenting tons of choice and consequences which I enjoyed. Especially in chapter 5 where you get to see one of the drow (dark elves) cities and see races like mind flayers and githyanki which obviously play a big role in BG3, so it was cool to see them here.

Now onto the story, which is easily the best part of this game. The main reason being the bad guy, Irenicus, who is now up there for me as one of the best villains in all of gaming next to Handsome Jack. He’s just so evil and selfish that you hate him but also his voice actor did such a great job with a commanding voice that made you interested in hearing what he has to say. He’s also present throughout the story and will appear multiple times unlike some final bosses in other CRPGs. And this man has been messing with me ever since the Siege of Dragonspear expansion (if you played it) from the first game, so revenge on him is all that much sweeter by the end. And while the story is very serious, there are some humorous moments in the writing which had me genuinely laughing. Like one time, where I had to get an item in a chest that was being guarded by a big-eyed monster called a beholder. So I went up and spoke to it, and it had a lot of opinions about what’s going on in the city and those annoying imps around the corner and their stupid riddle quest they try to get people to do. And when you ask what’s in the chest they're just like “I don’t know, I was just told to stand here and guard it.”. Definitely had me chuckling as I played.

But overall, a great sequel to an already fantastic RPG in the first game. I look forward to the Throne of Baal expansion next. | Great title. Played it back in the days as a kid ( still fondly remember the Polish localization, with professional tier 1 actors doing voice-overs). Came back to give it a spin on Steam deck as my 'before-going-to-sleep' treat. Holds really well. I really do think that You can't call Yourself a true cRPG fan if You didn't at least once give it a try. 

The bittersweet part is, as I finished it today, I've read the same day that the infamous senior writer responsible for Dragon Age: Crapguard might actually be involved in BG4 creation...all rumors at this point of course...still made me kind of sad :( | loved this game, but now have tried everything and game just never even gets past starting up before it closes :( | It's NOT nice to see how much rpg games have changed in nearly 30 years.

It sucks because the steam release is half baked and seems like it was published as a draft by a bunch of interns. There is no save functionality. The UI is unintuitive and prone to causing serious errors or missed opportunities. What's really bad is with seemingly just a few more hours of work and addressing feedback this could be a fine adaptation.

If you love the board game (and I do) you won't be disappointed with this version | I really wanted to like this game, even if it is based on a board game that is really old. The early aspects I found quite enjoyable, moving around the board, facing encounters, and getting stronger. Two aspects of this game just killed it for me: PVP and the end game. Essentially, I see no real reason to do anything but a strength character. Craft lets you get around a little easier at times, but strength can just steamroll everything, and if a caster has to PVP a strength character, they lose. The end game is nothing but luck. I spent nine rounds on the crown, and only twice did the command spell work. By then, two other strength players had reached me, and even with decent strength, it couldn't compete with those who had strength in double digits. It just killed the whole experience for me, as I had no method to win. Even the others agreed how broken it was.

Ця частина вийшла відмінною і за якістю її можна порівняти з першою Deponia. Друга не так потрапила в мене і протягом всієї гри складалося враження, що її робили поспіхом.
+ Шикарний арт-дизайн. Все виконано у впізнаваному фірмовому стилі з строкатою гамою кольорів. На будь-якій локації завжди є за що зачепитися оку.
+ Прекрасно прописані персонажі. Головний герой Руфус, як і раніше, егоцентричний, цинічний і самозакоханий. Майже кожен персонаж запам'ятовується і має чітко виражений характер.
+ Добре написані діалоги. Іскрометний гумор (хоча іноді і скочується). Класні пародії.
+ Прикольні анімації та кат-сцени. Особливо сподобалося як художники попрацювали з мімікою, по обличчях можна повністю визначити емоцію героїв, або скласти їх психопортрет.
+ Відмінний музичний супровід.
+ Точно підібрані голоси озвучування.
+ Цікавий сеттинг.
+ Епічний та філософсько-емоційний фінал. Гра захоплююче закриває сюжетну арку.

+/- Олдскульні та складні головоломки можуть сподобатися не всім. Місцями химерна логіка може ввести в ступор, але це почерк Daedalic, до якого я особисто звик ;) .

- Є невеликий дисбаланс у темпі гри. Деякі розділи розтягнуті та складні, деякі проходять легше та веселіше.

У мене були деякі побоювання після другої частини, але Goodbye Deponia вийшла чудовою і подарувала багато гарних емоцій та посмішок. 8.5 з 10 | Some of the things Rufus does in this installment are utterly despicable, so I understand why some folks feel very uncomfortable about the series in general. But I think we're not meant to condone anything Rufus does just because ""it progresses the game"". I WAS legit discomforted at certain parts but perhaps that was the intention. 

Rufus is NOT a good guy.. He is an asshole who doesn't care who gets screwed over nor how as long as he gets his way.  Him being an asshole, and getting punished for his hubris is the entire point.

Few game series FORCE you to play as an utterly reprehensible, self-centered and despicable bastard , see him get exactly what he deserves in the end  and STILL feel  bad for him at the end after laughing at his past misfortunes. Or maybe you're happy with that. Your mileage may vary how much you tolerate Rufus, and that's ok.
 | Логический конец трилогии, который оставляет после себя пустоту в душе. Хочется стереть память и пройти все заново. | Goodbye Deponia was a mixed bag, where the good outweighs the bad. I am a big flustered at the ending, as it is illogical and makes little sense to me, but the journey makes the game still worth the overall experience. 

The game was a much smoother experience than the second edition of the series, but I did still have a few sections that froze and required me to close and restart the game. In all, it was mostly problem free.

The humor was hit and miss, but targeted a wide variety of topics. I have read there is some controversy on some of the humor, to which I did find some things lacking humor, many of the comedic aspects did land well. 

For me, the biggest flaw of the game is the sudden switch in the final act. The characters, in the final moments, behaved contradictory to everything that makes logical sense and the development of the characters. In short, the final moments of the game do not fit the entirety of the first two games and the third installment up to this point.

Overall, Goodbye Deponia is recommended, as a funny and sometimes edgy humor casual experience. We do not know what drives a creative mind to make sudden changes, but it is their story to frame or burn in the museum of presented art. | ユーモラスのセンスが合うかどうかですかね。私は合わなかった。",The Deponia family is a family of two.

Slot machines at the casinos are a prime example. However, with 7 Grand Steps, there's more at stake. Your coins are steps to improving oneself in the world. In this case, a coin operated Ancient Egypt. You have coins that denote the 'skills' you can adept yourself in as it pushes you forward into time. If you decide to excel yourself in the society, you move up in the social hiearchy. You can find new techs (skills) or become a hero through its adventure-story style of narrative.

However, once you get to the ruler class, it becomes a challenge and that is what I admire: a game that is actively trying to push you back if you screw up. It is telling you to learn the mechanics again and come back when you are ready. That is why I am recommending this game. It is a game that is responding to your choices, your shifts and your play of the coins. Who knew a slot machine would be this fun? | 7 Grand Steps is an ambitious game. It provides a single-player boardgame experience against computer-controlled AI characters set amongst the classic ages of history. Unfortunately, the experience is enormously crippled by the random elements of the game. Progress often feels the benefit of luck, and the frequent impediments to your progress are frustrating and feel beyond player control. While the various storylines you'll encounter are somewhat engaging, they are often hopelessly vague. Character choices that work for one individual utterly fail for another. While training children is an important part of the game, the parents can reproduce beyond their means, such that nurturing each child becomes impossible. Should you choose to dote on one child, rivalries will develop which hinder progress down the line. 

While progress is exciting, especially from Age to Age, due to the strange and random nature of the game, you could be forced to play one Age for a great length of time. As you are forced to make the same choices again and again, the tedium weighs the experience down, such that slogging through the wheel becomes a chore. While you may find the game has an instant surface appeal, it doesn't ultimately hold up. The lives of the characters in the game feel beyond any meaningful influence, and each turn eventually feels mechanical. 

The initial wonder of the experience was greatly muted after a few hours of play, to the point that I couldn't explain why I continued to play. The structure of 7 Grand Steps is intriguing, but sadly, it is a flawed creation. ""Winning"" the game is an empty achievement: the end result of many hours of token creation in a blind universe. | While this may look like a traditional board game, the depth on hand is remakable.  In using cards/events to tell your characters story the game allows you to create a much more vivid tale of your own.  

RPG meets board game, and I cannot wait for the follow up. | Matriarca aos crocodilos

Jamais sairia recomendando ""7 Grand Steps"" por aí. Mesmo assim, todas as vezes que comecei a jogar levei horas para me livrar dele. Em contraste com o ""grinding"" de um JRPG tradicional, em que ações repetitivas geram um bem-estar quase hipnótico, aqui as mecânicas inspiram apenas uma ansiedade indistinta. Uma sensação de ""o que diabos estou fazendo?"", acompanhada pela impossibilidade de parar.

Ambientado nos primórdios da civilização, com elementos que lembram o Crescente Fértil e o Antigo Egito, o jogo é uma mistura de estratégia e simulação com ""puzzle"" e gerenciamento de recursos, mecânicas de jogos de tabuleiro e estética de máquinas de salão do início do século XX.

É uma saga familiar que se confunde com a história humana: o objetivo é criar uma linhagem que sobreviva ao tempo. Educar filhos, aprender habilidades, ascender socialmente, superar rivais, tudo se faz a partir de fichas.

É enganosamente simples. A cada geração que escapa de ser devorada pelos crocodilos sempre à espreita, uma história gradualmente mais complexa vai se construindo. Relações entre irmãos ganham importância, avós deixam saudade, ambições começam a escapar do controle. Ao mesmo tempo, o jogo começa a parecer desonesto, vulnerável demais ao acaso. Mas começamos a aceitar a ausência de justiça, conformados com mais esse elemento de realismo. E jogamos só mais um turno.

Tenho 241 outros jogos no Steam. Mesmo assim, sempre voltava a ""7GS"". Sem entender o porquê. Quando minha compulsão era, por exemplo, ""Crusader Kings II"", o impulso era fácil de entender. ""CK2"" é uma experiência muito rica, uma obra-prima de narrativa emergente feita sob medida para fanáticos por história. Mas ""7GS"" é quase oposto: ao invés do prazer de infinitas possibilidades, rotina. Trabalho. Cansaço. E, no máximo, um muito vago senso de realização.

Quando chegamos à última (digamos) fase, a família ascende enfim à classe dominante e a mecânica ganha uma bem-vinda nova camada: além de escrever a crônica da família é preciso gerenciar o reino. É uma implementação de ""Hamurabi"", o primeiro game de estratégia, criado em 1968, mas figurinha carimbada nos micros dos anos 1980. É quase um recado dos desenvolvedores: tudo aqui é o primeiro passo. O início da civilização, o começo dos arcades, o princípio dos jogos de estratégia.

E este ""7GS"" é também apenas o primeiro passo, com o subtítulo ""Step 1: what ancients begat"". É difícil até imaginar no que consistirão os próximos seis passos. Além da progressão de tempo na ambientação, a estética também vai mudar? E as mecânicas? Nem faço ideia. Mas estarei lá, jogando, para descobrir.

Acabei entendendo o que me fazia voltar ao jogo ao observar meu filho de seis anos. Chegava perto enquanto eu jogava e ficava ali, olhando. ""Esses são os pais?"", apontava. ""Posso colocar uma fichinha?"". ""Cuidado com os crocodilos!"". E então percebi como o jogo apela como poucos ao nosso instinto de sobrevivência. Tudo lembra a sensação cotidiana de estar vivo. E contra isso é difícil resistir. Só mais um turno. Só mais um dia. 

http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/danielpellizzari/2014/01/1399122-matriarca-aos-crocodilos.shtml | I kind of have mixed feelings about this game. I would give it 5/10. Good, playable, but with serious drawbacks.

Upsides: 
It does give you a strangely epic feeling - you do feel like a part of history itself, looking at stories of families not at the level of each individual, but ultimately, for the entire family bloodline, as a whole. I would say that this epicness is the most unusual part about this game, which no other games I've ever played offers.
The graphics and music is also not bad for a game of its size.

Downsides:
The biggest problem is the disconnect between player's choices and their consequences, and the lack of any coherent logic as to how and why to make decisions. For example, when your family is facing a crisis of the age, you are given 4 questions, each with 4 choices - and after you choose all 4 answers, you kind of get a ""score"" on how you did. But there is absolutely no prompts as to why one answer may or may not be correct - and the worst answer kills your character outright, and the previous 2-3 hours of your gameplay is wasted. What the hell?! This happens in other places too...

To make this even worse, there's no SAVE functionality in this game - just Pause/Continue. I understand that history cannot be rewinded, and that decisions are decisions. It makes sense, but this is a game, for people to play. It is not meant to punish the player harshly. If the character you control dies, you lose your previous 2-3 hours of progress; If all you characters of the current generation dies, you are dead. Your game progress is completely erased. What the hell?!

Overall, I like this game for what it's good for, but I hate it for what it's bad for. I'm not playing it again.",a bit stale and a little trite.

Of course, you need to take it easy and not take any of the narrator's comments personally, as the game constantly makes fun of you. And I guess that’s why everyone loves it - ignoring the narrator’s words and having fun messing with each other. Sometimes, it’s crazy how well the scripting is done, allowing you to make different choices and still receive a unique response. This isn’t your typical walking simulator, especially with cool achievements like keeping the game on for an entire Tuesday (yes, 24 hours straight...) or not playing for five years and then coming back.

 | Great narrator, excellent narrative weirdness, and a repetitive loop make this actually a lot of fun to just keep running around inside. | This is an interesting game. There's a narrator that tells the entire story. You have two choices; obey the narrator and follow the story, or disobey the narrator and create your own story. There are several endings you can choose from, and everything you do affects the story in a different way. Overall, this game has unique gameplay that's different than other games. | The narration/Narrator absolutely makes this game 

You'll spend the game going against the narrator, just so you can hear what he'll say about it.
For a game which is literally just walking around listening to a guy talk, its surprisingly engaging and amusing

After putting more than 750 hours into this game over more than 10 years, I am finally ready to write a review.

This is it.  The space 4x strategy game that I keep coming back to among all the others.  I have played Stellaris, Sins of a Solar Empire, Masters of Orion, StarDrive, Endless Space, even space 4x games as far back as Spaceward Ho! and Stars!, which probably gives away my age.  I've even played through Distant Worlds 2 (though not since some major updates were made).  None of them keep me coming back time and again like Distant Worlds Universe.

The graphics are 2D, and fairly simple by today's standards. The UI is complex and often difficult to understand. The learning curve is very steep. Planet management is a bit lighter and less involved than other space 4X games. With such a huge barrier for new players, why then do I put it at my #1 spot? I have a lot of reasons.

Grand Scale: Galaxies can have up to 1500 stars, each with their own system of planets, asteroid fields, resources, ancient artifacts, ruins, and the occasional primitive civilization. Sprinkled between those stars are anomalies, space monsters, abandoned star bases, derelict ships (which you can repair or salvage for research), a rich history of a galactic war that happened centuries ago, and a looming threat of the return of a savage species.

Control Customization: You can take full control and micromanage every little detail throughout the game. Or, you can handle a single starship flying around the galaxy while the AI handles everything else in your empire. Or anything in between.

Heroes: Leader (one per faction), ship captains, fleet admirals, planet governors, scientists, spies, ambassadors. Each with their own set of perks and drawbacks.  Some scientists might be very skilled in one or more areas of research, but might also be a foreign spy, which gives other factions a much greater chance of stealing research from you.  A fleet admiral might be an excellent tactician, leading to greater targeting accuracy and damage, but might also be a drunkard, leading to slower hyper drive speed and greater ship maintenance costs.

Espionage: Distant Worlds Universe has the most involved, compelling, and choice-rich espionage system of any space 4X I've played.  Each mission requires that you send one of your hero spies (no nameless, disposable spies in this game!), and a mission failure is a very real loss--if your spy is captured, he's gone for good, along with all of the work you've put into carefully developing his skills.  And if your last spy is lost, then you are unable to perform any espionage missions until a new agent appears!

Ship Design:  I've seen many different ship designers in space 4x games.  Some are decent, some feel really dumbed-down (I'm looking at YOU, Endless Space!).  But Distant Worlds and StarDrive have by far my favorite ship design mechanics.  You can design a ship literally any way you want!  You can create a flying fuel cell with barely enough hull to protect the crew from the void of space, designed to speed out and scout distant areas while still making it back with any fuel to spare.  You can create colony ships with double capacity to give you a head-start in a new colony.  How about a missile boat that deliberately stays at long range to pelt enemies with a shower of long-range missiles?  (Yes, you can give each ship class specific directives on how to behave when encountering enemies.)

Design star bases, construction platforms, research facilities, resort hotels (yes, your people need entertainment too!), mining outposts, deep space observatories (for spying on enemy factions or getting early-warning notice when enemy fleets are inbound), and orbital defense platforms to help protect your colonies from surprise invasions.  Just like with ship design, base design is wide open as to what components you want to put into each base type.

Scientific Research:  There are three entirely different research sections: Weapons/Armor/Tactics, Energy/Construction, and High Tech/Science.  You can conduct one research project from each of them simultaneously.  The speed at which they are researched depends on the size of your population, along with the specific skills of your scientist heroes and how much research ""capacity"" you have constructed (in the form of research facilities).

Exploration:  With a vast galaxy, limited fuel, and warp speed requiring research before use, in the early game just exploring your own starting solar system is exciting, as you discover what resources are available and try to find that oh-so-elusive ""warp field precursors"" data left on one of your system's planets by the few survivors of a centuries-old galactic war.  Early research advancements in fuel capacity, engine thrust, and directional thrust are critical in how efficiently you explore and exploit the resources available in your home system.  By the time you are ready to leave the cradle and travel to nearby stars, exploration starts all over again with your first barely warp-capable scouts travelling and discovering critical fuel-resources in order to extend your empire's reach.  In fact, exploration is viable and fun throughout the early- and mid-game, and by the time you hit end-game, your scout ships' purposes shift to being deep-space scanners to be able to see through the fog of war.

I could go on: Race variety. Diplomacy. Resource mining/management. Planet-destroying super weapons. Fuel management. Race-unique win conditions.

This game is a dream for those who love this genre.  Buy this game.  Have the patience and courage to get past the obtuse user interface and complex game mechanics, and you will find a gem of a game where I, after more than a decade of play later, am still learning new things. | game does not launhc on windows 11, tried lots of supposed fixes

Если вам кажется, что жизнь — это боль, просто попробуйте Darkest Dungeon. Эта игра покажет, что боль бывает разной: острая, как критический удар босса, тягучая, как бесконечный гринд, и горькая, как осознание, что твоя лучшая команда сошла с ума в первом же походе. 🎭

[h2]Визуал, ощущение и звук — атмосферно как похоронный марш 🎻⚰️[/h2]
Готическая рисовка, гипнотический саундтрек и диктор, чей голос мог бы зачитывать эпитафию, создают невероятную атмосферу. Смотреть на игру приятно, слушать — тоже, но вот играть… Это уже отдельный вопрос.
[b]Геймплей — „ещё один заход, и спать“ (ложь!) [/b]🔄😵

[h2]Игра — бесконечный цикл страданий:[/h2]
❗️Собрал героев (учёл их страхи, фобии и дурные привычки).
❗️Снарядил их (понял, что денег мало, продал ненужные тринкеты, теперь их не хватает на лечение).
❗️Отправил в поход (один герой впал в безумие, второй едва пережил два смертельных удара, третий просто умер).
❗️Вернулся в город (игровой зал ограблен, лечиться негде, нервный тик у игрока усиливается).
❗️Повторил всё снова (а мог бы заняться чем-то полезным, но нет).

[h2]„Рандом“ и баланс — где правда? 🎲[/h2]
Одни говорят: «всё зависит от удачи», другие — «опытный игрок контролирует хаос». Истина где-то посередине. Когда ты промазал, враг уклонился, а потом вмазал тебе критом — это „игровая механика“. Когда ты сделал то же самое — „баланс“.

but its like an abusive relationship i jjuust keep wanting more, yes one more dd1 run, just one more yeah dude yeah yeaha just onee more broooo just one moreeee fuckk my life FUCKKK WHY ARE YOU MISSING, STOP MISSING YOU PIECE OF SHIT LEPER FUCKING HIT THAT BITCH ALREADY | É de fato um jogo intrigante. Você passa um bom tempo jogando como se ele fosse um jogo qualquer, quando na verdade o rumo que se deve ter é completamente diferente. Darkest Dungeon é uma das minhas experiências mais difíceis que eu tive nos últimos anos com jogos. A jogabilidade é extremamente punitiva, nociva caso não saiba o que está fazendo. Um dos núcleos do jogo, é o dinheiro. É necessário entrar nas missões (dungeons), se importar com fazer dinheiro, sua sobrevivência e ainda completar o seu objetivo. Conciliar todos esses fatores, transforma a experiência em um ciclo maçante de fazer dinheiro e upar personagens para o final do jogo. Penso que essa ferramenta utilizada para ser a ponte principal do Darkest Dungeon, pode ser bem mal vista para quem pensa em zerar o jogo.

Mas, além de tudo, gostaria de enaltecer a arte característica e virtuosa, que transmite perfeitamente a atmosfera obscura das dungeons, da sofrência e do medo. A direção artística voltada ao tema ""Lovecrafteana"", é muito bem feito, principalmente no que se diz progressão visual. Os ambientes se tornando mais medonhas cada vez que você vai progredindo para o final do jogo, a mudança de cores voltadas ao cosmo e carnificina ou até mesmo as músicas que passam de um violino arranhado e agitado para algo mais ""contemplador""

Por fim, vai minha dica:
- Se você quiser uma experiência menos massiva, jogue na dificuldade Radiante
- Caso queira sofrer um pouco mais, tendo que repetir missões para ficar mais forte, jogue na Mais Escura
- E se você for um mutante, jogue na mais difícil mesmo, é uma experiência semelhante a estar em um quarto branco com camisa de força no corpo | 新手上手不难，甚至比月计还简单一些，风格也熟悉，各位主管，司书，管理员必入 | This is a game I played on an off for years, and both loved it and grew frustrated by it as I played.  This last year I decided it was time to beat the game finally, so I dedicated a bit more of my gaming time to it, and feel I can give some fairly informed thoughts on the game.  

Darkest Dungeon has a fun party management system that is well designed and the heart and soul of the game.  Do you select your ranged skills for your Highwayman so he can be in position 3?  Or do you take his pos 1/2 skills and play more of a high risk high reward style of play up front?  Do you put your jester in the back making him a buffing character?  Or do you put him further forward so you can apply bleed and be more of a DPS character?  It allows you to make a lot of different parties in different ways, and as you play you learn what combo's works best for each situation, and which ones you prefer to play.  

The enemies also have positions that work differently for each enemy type, and some of your characters will let you manipulate the positions of your enemies to mess them up or put them in a position for one of your other characters to pummel them into the dirt.   So overall the game play is EXCELLENT.

Where I had my struggles with the game was losing characters.  When I first started playing the game it really hurt to lose that Leper that I had been using effectively for so many dives into the dungeon.  I eventually learned that dying is an important aspect of the game, and if you upgrade your stagecoach you will be just fine.  The death of the characters also adds weight to your decisions in the game.  If you decide to get too crazy with a party/skill composition there is a very real chance you are going to lose some of your characters.  So if you decide to play Darkest dungeon just accept right off the bat that death is part of the grim dark theme of the game.

The other aspect of the game that people may not like is the tone and atmosphere of the game.  It is a grim dark themed horror game.  Horror is not really my jam to be honest, but the game play and how the theme is executed, and the great narration of the game drew me in despite my lack of interest in the horror genre.  

Overall the game play is excellent, and the setting, style and art of the game is unique and intriguing.  I would highly recommend this to people looking for a great rogue like dungeon crawler that stands out in an over crowded market.",h2]Darkest Dungeon — a symbol of the power of the otet

« Spintires » bénéficie d’une réalisation particulièrement soignée (aspect et physique des véhicules, de la fumée des pots d’échappement, de l’eau,  des courants et de la boue, des différents types de sols et des traces de roues, des lumières, de la végétation). La restitution des bruits n’est pas en reste (moteurs, grue, treuil, tension des câbles, craquements des arbrisseaux, cris d’animaux diurnes et nocturnes...). Les éléments d’environnement sont, pour la plupart, destructibles. À l’ensemble a été ajouté un joli cycle jour/crépuscule/nuit/aurore.

Ici, pas d’arcade, les développeurs ayant résolument choisi l’option simulation avec deux niveaux de difficulté (« Simplifié » et « Simulation »). Si le choix de départ se limite à cinq environnements (« Côte », « La colline », « Plaines », « Traversée de la rivière », « Volcan »), ces derniers ont le mérite d’être plutôt variés et assez vastes pour que l’on se perde facilement, même armé d’une boussole et d’une carte.
Le manque d’une « vue cabine » est dommageable, mais ne constitue pas un handicap insurmontable. Le mouvement de la caméra et le maniement des cartes ne sont pas évidents au début, mais l’on s’y fait... De plus, un tutoriel plus consistant n’aurait pas été de trop !

À noter, une option « multijoueur », désertée... (Il est néanmoins possible de créer son salon privé pour relever des défis entre amis).

Les touches sont paramétrables et, pour couronner le tout, « Spintires » est très bien optimisé, ce qui le rend accessible aux possesseurs d’un ordinateur de gamme moyenne.

Les « succès » sont nombreux, mais pas toujours simples et/ou rapides à décrocher.

Pour conclure, bien loin de regretter mon achat, j’attribue à ce jeu une note de 17/20. | このゲームの目的は、端的にいうと丸太をマップ上の数箇所に運ぶ。ただそれだけのゲームです。

上記のとおり、ゲームとしては非常にシンプルなのですが、ロシアの厳しい自然を舞台としたマップを、屈強なロシア製トラック（軍用も有）に乗り、泥まみれになってスタックしたり、運転席が隠れそうなほどの水深の川や湖を渡ったり、時には装備しているウインチを使用して泥沼から這い出たり方向転換しながら目的地に向かいます。ちなみにスピードは、下り坂を使用しても大して出ません。（速度計すら無い）
スタックした場合には、いつでも他のトラックに乗り移ることが可能なので、走破性の良い他のトラックで引っ張ってレスキューすることが可能です。また、故障・燃料切れの際にも、他のトラックに装備を整えて同様にレスキューに行くことが可能です。
ここでちょっとだけアドバイス、表示はされているけど欲しい装備を装着できないときは、現在の装備を外してください。そうすると選べるようになります。あと、トレーラーは対応する荷台を装着しないと選べません。

このゲームの他にも、オフロードやトラックをテーマとしたゲーム・シミュレーターは有りますが、このゲームの様に判断を誤れば直ぐにスタックしてしまうような本格的なオフロードを、しかもトラックで走行するものは非常に珍しいと思います。

オフロード、トラック、ウインチ、クレーン、泥んこ、シベリア、シミュレーション、厳しい大自然、マイペース、どれかピンと来るものが有ったらオススメです。

また、動画サイトで ""RUSSIAN TRUCK""で検索すれば、このゲームのテーマとなった屈強なロシアン・トラックたちを見ることができるでしょう。

今天起来找老外玩了局多人，如果大家互相合作的话感觉是挺不错的，因为有绞盘这个设定让很多事情变得可能，比如互相帮助什么的，但是地图多样性暂时不够，现在的5张图基本就是泥土+树林+河流（因为背景在俄罗斯嘛，都是西伯利亚的感觉。。），希望以后能出些沙漠啊或者雨林或者雪山，极地之类极端环境的图。车辆损伤对于这个真实向的游戏来说不是很好，居然只是以单纯的血条来计算，如果是模块化损伤就更好了。
还有就是这视角。这视角。从去年的tech demo开始这视角就一直如此坑爹，稍微挂个大点的东西就真的很难看前面的路了··· | Simulator ... voilà bien un nom qui hantera nombre de jeux pendant longtemps. Outre Euro Truck Simulator 2 qui avait su récemment se démarquer de ce sinistre augure, voilà qu'un nouveau simulateur de camions débarque dans une optique toute autre, et le résultat est loin d'être inintéressant.

Simulation de camion obligeant, le principe du jeu est en soit simple comme bonjour : acheminer des objets d'un point A vers un point B. La simulation, comme toujours, résidera dans les bâtons dans les roues que vous mettra le jeu pour y arriver. Si vous pensez vous en tirer à la légère parce que vous roulez dans des engins russes qui nécessitent 50 L d'oxygène pour gonfler un pneu, détrompez vous, car exigence et précision seront de rigueur.

En effet, le gameplay se veut suffisamment poussé pour que l'on ne fonce pas à travers la forêt en faisant simplement attention de ne pas détruire ou retourner son engin. En effet, en fonction du type de terrain que vous allez traverser, attendez vous à vous embourber sérieusement sans autre alternative que le copain qui vient vous aider avec un câble de remorquage. A ce titre, il est très plaisant de constater que la physique générale (des véhicules, des arbres, etc ...) est très bien rendue : non, pas de vitesse quantique négative typique des jeux simulators lorsque vous faites une collision un peu atypique. Aidée par un très jolie terra-transformation avec un moteur de déformation procédurale, vous transformerez vite une ballade champêtre pour livrer des ""petits"" rondins de bois en véritable ""parkour"" motorisé. Dès lors, vous vous énerverez facilement sur votre frein à main et vos quatre roues motrices lors d'une montée disons .... boueuse.

De plus, et point important du titre qui peut facilement faire railler quant on voit un titre aussi atypique : il y a un multijoueur. Au début on a tendance à sourire bêtement en se demandant ce qu'il peut apporter dans une telle simulation. Et bien après une (longue) nuit de coopération à quatre (maximum de joueurs sur une carte), force est de constater avec un plaisir assez surprenant que le côté entre-aide de vrais routiers moustachus qui pataugent dans la gadoue est un vrai bonheur, d'autant que la petite communauté de ce jeu reste parsemé d'individus qui viendront vous aider et vous donner des conseils à des moments délicats (le fait de mettre un câble sur un arbre pour aider une montée, de bien utiliser les différences séquences-moteur, etc ...).

Techniquement, le point n'ayant pas encore été abordé, le jeu s'en tire également avec pas mal d'éloges : les engins russes sont (très) bien modélisés, et la végétation des différentes cartes du jeu sont très plaisantes à parcourir tant de jours comme de nuit. Il reste assez regrettable qu'hormis la carte ""Volcano"", le reste des maps soit assez identique les unes des autres. De plus, l'orientation de la caméra du jeu est très étrange puisque se révèle très rigide dans ses déplacements.

Au final, quid? Et bien Spintires (oui, par pitié, pas ""Camions-tout-terrain simulator"") se révèle être une bonne petite surprise pour peu que l'on ne soit pas réfractaire au genre de la simulation et qu'on dispose d'un peu de temps (attention : le jeu peut avoir des tendances chronophages en multijoueur) pour partir à l'assaut de Dame Nature en écoutant l'hymne national de la mère patrie. Vous avez aimé Euro Truck Simulator 2 et regrettez un manque de challenge de ce dernier? Spintires vous occasionnera de bons moments. Vous vous êtes égarés sur Internet? Pesez le pour et le contre, mais ne jugez pas rapidement un titre qui possède des atouts indéniables malgré quelques défauts encore notables.

This is a simple RPG that, while being very accessible to young kids or people who prefer to stick to the exploration and story side of things, can still be quite challenging on the hardest difficulty. It's chock-full of classic but lovingly crafted story tidbits, plenty of clever humor, heartwarming characters, easter eggs, rewarding little secrets to dig up if you explore thoroughly enough. Achievements that actually unlock usefull things? Yes, please. It's got something for everyone.

Ultimately, a full, unhurried but to-the-point (due to familiarity) run takes me about 10 hours of gameplay, which I feel is plenty to enjoy without it ever feeling stretched or bloated. This is a game completely free of bland sidequests. What's more, every time I dive into it I find new little details to enjoy. It still feels fresh after years of replays, and after my nth ""wow, still great"", I thought it was about time I left a review. 

Looking forward to what the devs cook up next, and suscribed to their newsletter for that reason. Thank you for this sweet little hidden gem clearly so full of enthusiasm and heart!",Loved it!

76561197970698176,264710,Subnautica,5.066666666666666,"Adventure, Indie",1,"Subnautica is a ""crafting survival"" kind of game done right. You won't be farming mobs for XP, punching trees for 10 minutes straight or otherwise grinding ridiculous amounts of materials for basic crafting and upgrades. What you will be doing instead is mostly exploring and uncovering the mysteries of this game's gorgeous depths, utilizing vehicles rarely seen in other games and improving your gear so you could go deeper. You of course could gather lots of materials and build giant bases should you want to but strictly speaking it is neither required nor really meaningfully rewarded by the game. You'll need a starter base and one, at most two more in deeper areas. Subnautica is about going on a journey, quite often in a literal sense, learning about its world and the story behind the player character's situation and ultimately - getting out of there. Resource gathering is simply means to an end and fortunately you don't need that much. Progress is gated by exploration and some gear upgrades as more advanced and rare resources are only found in biomes that are farther away from the starting area.

The atmosphere, music, visuals, setting are all stellar. Story is... functional, I guess. It is there but it doesn't make too much sense. Good enough to not get in the way which is not necessarily bad on its own. Plenty of plot holes if you really care but definitely nothing bad enough to shatter your suspension of disbelief.

I would like to make a separate point regarding the behaviour of other life forms seen in the game world. Most of them are quite simply animals and they behave like animals would. Won't delve into detail as not to spoil anything, but the majority of other living beings are as preoccupied with their own survival as the player is.

It was refreshing to simply be done with this kind the game in 50 hours or so but really it could be finished in around 30. Instead of wasting the player's time in grind-build-upgrade cycles Subnautica logically wraps up and has a defined, meaningful ending.

My two complaints would be performance and inventory management. Subnautica looks very pleasing and even cozy most of the time but also for the game of its age and graphical complexity it is very poorly optimised. I only had a good experience thanks to my system being much more potent than those that Subnautica was expected to be ran on release. As for inventory management, the game simply lacks even most basic QoL features but fortunately there are mods to fix that. One I would wholeheartedly recommend is EasyCraft. Others worthy of note would be Base Kits, Quick Slots Plus, Better Scanner Blips, Tweaks And Fixes and Defabricator.

But overall Subnautica is an easiest recommendation ever, it is one of the best if not THE best game in the whole genre. I wish I played it sooner. Just remember - if you are feeling lost all you need to do is explore and go deeper. | 这一次评测只为一个人，吃喝不愁的live，一位国内的汉化补丁制作人，他的补丁优秀，更新速度快，翻译准确，整洁，很舒服的汉化补丁。这么优秀的我们国内的制作人朋友，于2017年3月15日因胃癌晚期及转移，永远的离开了我们。

10 из 10 | In a nutshell, this game sounds kinda boring. However, in reality, it's the closest thing to a drug addiction. I love the simple joy of just driving, the game itself, the amazing mod support, and the fantastic community!

BUT: The driving and traffic mechanics often feel dull and repetitive, missing the depth and realism that a more sophisticated AI could provide. The AI frequently fails to effectively manage traffic congestion, offering only minimal solutions, which can be quite frustrating. Implementing a smarter, more customizable AI system would significantly improve the experience. Another major drawback is the physics engine, which lacks realism and responsiveness and need some mods to fix that.

Rating: 7/10 but with community supports: 9/10 | Приятная игра, медитативная. В иной раз хочется после завода посидеть, почилить, поболтать с мужиками, и чтобы не тупить без дела, руки чем-то занять- покрутить баранку, самое то.

Первая треть игры еще ничего, игра эдакий веселенький клон диабло, но в необычном сеттинге. Хотя уже тут начинает настораживать довольно большие кучки мобов. Врагов всегда пачка, но бить их доставляет.
Во второй трети ты уже начинаешь понимать что нужно качать в первую очередь и докачиваешь все нужные скиллы, мобов уничтожаешь пачками, но иногда спотыкаешься на странно сбалансированных мобов. Попадаются очень жирные враги, которые выкачивают всю ману (а все дамажные скиллы зависят от нее), и при этом наносят фуру урона. Мне, к примеру приходилось возвращаться в хаб и перекачиваться обратно на самую слабую милишную атаку, так как только она не зависит от маны, но и дамага у нее раз в 5 меньше, чем у меня было до этого.
Наконец, в последней трети вылазит вся кривость геймдизайна и местного баланса. В финале каждая лока примерно на уровень опережает твой текущий. При этом защита от урона на шмотках и уровень дамага оружия начинает расти по экспоненте. Между мечом условно 25 и 26 уровня процентов 30-40 разница, тоже самое с защитой. В игре 3 основных вида урона от врагов  - физический, яд и молния. Если от физики еще можно как-то прокачаться, то от вторых я не нашел способа буста защиты, только от шмоток. Пока не прокачаешь эту разницу между твоим левелом и уровнем локи - крайне тяжело играть, противников куча и тебя сносят за секунды. Причем я проходил практически все сайды, это не помогает.
Ну и последние локации - это просто песня. Я там в тупую убегал от мобов до выхода, с ними не реально честно драться. Благо финальный босс, оказался гораздо легче чем усиленные противники. 
За последнюю треть и финал - жирный минус всей игре. В целом по скидке и если прям тянет на диаблоиды наверное можно поиграть, так как представителей жанра не особо то и много. Моя оценка 6 из 10. | I found is as very tematic game, I sugest to play on heroic, and enjoy. The game itself a nice looter, arcade shooter, and roleplay, there a great music, tho its a bit repetitive... and.. its all. Plus I want to say to devs.... Its not called challenge to outspam player with mobs, there a few maps, that I couldnt spawn at the enterance and spawned in the middle of the map, because of the amout of enemies. Plus conroling with left button the caracter, and also shoot with, its bad Idea... all the teleporting units, makes your caracter to stand like an idiot and shoot, at the moment of dodge. | What I wouldn't do, doesn't apply to this game.

Hexcells é um jogo de puzzle super curto e excelente para relaxar e se concentrar em algo diferente. Possui uma mecânica bem interessante e puzzles realmente desafiadores nos níveis mais altos.

[h2] Jogabilidade [/h2]
A jogabilidade é muito parecida com campo minado, cada número representa quantos hexágonos azuis tem em volta do hexágono com esse número e o objetivo é encontrar todos os azuis. O jogo explora isso ao máximo, adicionando novas informações como o número de azuis em cada linha ou diagonal, se estão em sequência ou separados, por aí vai.

[h2] Puzzles [/h2]
Os puzzles são muito bem feitos, dá pra sentir o carinho do desenvolvedor com o jogo. Um hexágono no canto inferior esquerdo pode desbloquear uma nova pista no canto superior direito e isso faz o jogo ser bem dinâmico, não ficando preso somente numa região esperando liberar outra.

古いHDDを整理していたら、小さいころ遊んでいた作者様の作品「シルフェイド見聞録」を発掘し、続編が出ていないか調べたらなんでも、他にもさまざまな作品を手掛けていると知り、その中の一つがこの「片道勇者」でした。作者様のサイトのフリー版を気づけば20時間ほど遊んでいて、溢れるパトスに従い有料版のプラスに手を伸ばすことになりました。

こちらは無料版と違い、いろいろと便利機能が加えられており、ほかにも新ジョブや様々な敵やアイテムが追加されています。
三千キロあたりでガンガン敵をなぎ倒し、自分が強いと思い込んで油断すると、一撃でオーバーキルされる点は無料版と同じです。爆弾でエリクサー症候群に患うと、自分がきたねぇ花火になるのも無料版と同じです。激辛弁当が炎上爆発するのはプラス版の追加要素です。弓持ってるこっちに石持って向かってくるバーサーカーを鼻で笑ったら、一撃で「ネームレス！新しい頭よ！」されるのはプラス版の追加要素です。多分。

深く考えると絶望しかない世界観ですし、断末魔もよく聞こえますが、基本的にノリが軽く、楽しく遊べます。
また、ＢＧＭもよく、魔王が現れたときのテンションのあがるＢＧＭは好みです。ほかにも、地形毎にＢＧＭが設定されており、飽きにくくなるよう工夫がされています。

I dunno, I just came back to this game and there is lots of change from the original concept, I just love the original concept how they looked, but this also does look good, but with all those ripoff models, it just almost killing me even trying to play this.

Also reading all those updates and developers writing makes me think that these developers literally just fooling around way too much, rather than being serious on this developing, sure the price is way low, but some people might not even want to put money on this with writing like that, but that is just me rambling about the writing style now.

Welp what I say about this game now at this state, I kinda like it, but not recommend to buy it now, even the price like 2 €.

It just it is almost out of the actual concept what I seen and read, but it is just me who just returned to check this game and I'll update this when I get good grasp on this game. | Unless you DON'T want to play a game that supposed to look EXACTLY like the trailer and videos they show for this... Don't get it... 

They have everything mixed with mario world crap, as I am not very fond of it. No tutorial, no directions, no clear passage ways, it still needs A LOT of work on this game.

I think the creators are getting lazy, changing their minds too soon, etc.

I love the game with the enemies like they showed and discribed in the trailer/videos... Zombies, dinosaurs, monkies, robots, flying robots, GIANT robots... 

Then... they... get... these... f*%$#ing things called........die guys... die guys = Shyguys... REALLY!? REALLY creators? Then they throw in there pokiemon, and some other random shit... 

This whole thing has gone to hell... IT was more beautufil when it started, with all the robots. Ever since they added mario themed stuff,... it just lost it's touch quickly for me... 

Do yourself a favor and show these creators how much of a fool they are, and DON""T donate ANY money to them.

I'm already planning to contact my credit card company, or go to steam and get my money back... It's really, really, really, sad for this game to go SO wrong... -_- | Sparkrising, as the trailer advertises you build a fort and defend crystals from waves of monster.
From flying bots to zombies, then you fight a big freaking mega bot of a boss....
That is what the game is all about right?

uhhh no...
no
no and uh no.

You have your exo suit, you shoot stuff, they die, you blow up a tower or two, you find a portal and then you leave....

Then you do the same thing, over and over and over again.

Back when I bought it, it did cost alot more, it had what was advertised but the bugs the general ""OH GOD THE FPS IS AT LIKE 0!"" made me uninstall and try again when my new laptop arrived.

now you have a stripped down indie shooter... thing.

now if you like that sort of thing then spend your £2.

other than that, RUN!


10/10 would waste my time again!

 | I've had this game in my library a long time ago, and since it was in greenlight, this game got me interested. I mean, a defense strategy game that lets you build your own defenses from buildings to towers, where you ride a giant ass mech suit during the fight?! SIGN ME IN!!!

I was exited for this game to come out, only to be dissapointed...
It didn't accomplish what it wanted, and flat out lied about the gameplay... It's now just like another Rogue-like, where the worlds are randomly generated, the ""A RUN IS NOT THE SAME"" route is taking. The gameplay went from a promising RTS sandbox creative game, to a linear, big mess of sounds and enemies, normal shooter. Also, it's loud. ""THEN TURN DOWN THE VOLUME"" I did.... Still loud.

The graphics aren't much to speak, it's squares, not much to say about it. At least it makes better shapes and forms than minecraft. The gun? Weak. Only good when charged, and charging makes you lose alot of time, for a game that is supposed to be ""FAST PACED SHOOTER OMG HUEHEUHEUEHEUHUEUEH"". The entire terrain is fully destructible (At least from the last time I played it, I don't know what the devs have been doing to this game), and it's still, STILL, PROMISING GIVING YOU THE CHANCE TO EXPORT CONSTRUCTIONS FROM MINECRAFT AND QUBICLE SINCE 2012!!! 3 YEARS!!

I don't want to give much hate about this game, I wanted to like this game, I wanted to be IN LOVE with this game, but seeing it as it's now, that hype? *poof* Blew out of the window. Not coming back.

Not saying that the game is bad, but it's definitly not good, and not the game that the devs promised that they would do while on Green light.

I do NOT recomend this game. | I bought this game for the cheap price tag before steam refunds were a thing.  I'd have refunded my two dollars if it had been, because this game is not what it tries to sell itself to be.  The arenas right now are these tiny areas.. where there's a never ending spawn of boxy bad guys that come in.  Destructable terrain?  Yes, it's there---doesn't really mean much because the map is so small that you hardly invest any feelings on the destruction.  ""Dynamically changing arena""?  Hardly.  It's a small place that's got you cramped in, and hiding between the sorta-space-ish looking structures while you try to get your shots in.  I'd call it unfinished, but it's not even that... it's not even something you could call a game right now as there's no point to anything you're doing in it.

Edit:  Also, don't trust that lying trailer.  You can't build jack-crap in this game ""yet"", as if it'll ever be implemented.","ripoff models, but now it's almost killing me even trying to play it."

I really enjoyed the problem solving, and scenario planning aspect of the game.  It is a ton of fun to play, once you figure it out, and this is where this game falls down, in guiding new players.  

I would highly recommend new players to not shun character guides and other online resources to get going.  This is a ten year old game and I think they purposefully designed the game around ""discovery"" mechanics (especially around character skill progression and item effects) so you learn by doing,  Which I think would be fine if you unlocked something that documented the information for you so if you step away for a few weeks you don't forget.  I find myself wasting resources to ""find out"" what something does only to have forgotten even later in the play through. 

Personally I think if this game underwent a UX/UI cleanup, slightly better tutorialization of some of the mechanics and better information persistance you could re-release this game today and it would attract a huge following. | OK game. Would be awesome without the following two issues. First, the game occasionally CTDs between floors and deletes the autosave (the only allowed save) in the process - so game over. Secondly, large monster waves are a big blob of moving pixels. It is almost impossible to tell which monsters and how many are attacking your heroes. Looks ugly too. I do not get why people like pixel art in this game. Pixel art was not a choice but a necessity back in the day. The best old pixel art (e.g. Prince of Persia, Lemmings) also looked way better than this hot mess. | Addictive, good looking, funny, rogue type game that makes you utilize brain and try it in different play modes.

On top of that the main game which is the newer game is pretty fun to play as well. Much like the old version however much longer and a fair bit more upgrading to the vehicle (mine truck thing). 

As a game in a whole its not hugely exciting however I really do find those old simple games a lot of fun so for me i'd give this a 4/5.

[h2]Resumen del juego[/h2]
Es un juego cuya mecánica principal es el [b]deckbuilding[/b] y los combates de cartas al estilo [i]Magic: The Gathering[/i]. En su modo campaña está dirigido por la exploración de distintos escenarios en los que conseguiremos distintos recursos (las cartas, artefactos), se nos irá contando una trama desde distintos puntos de vista (las facciones), e iremos subiendo de nivel (más vida y elección de algún trait) a medida que ganamos combates.

Si disfrutas de los juegos de cartas, pero estás saturado de juegos competitivos, metas, y modelos de progresión que parecen un trabajo o una inversión esto es una interesante ventana a otro tiempo y otro enfoque si tienes la paciencia para lidiar con sus inconveniencias.

[h2]Lo que yo he disfrutado[/h2]
+ Ir acumulando [i]backlog[/i] de cartas con el que ir perfeccionando o probando nuevas estrategias
+ La necesaria adaptación a los distintos encuentros te obliga a ir experimentando y no estás penalizado por perder un combate e intentarlo tantas veces necesites
+ Las distintas campañas se centran en una facción, pero según progresas puedes ir mezclando
+ Ir cambiando al vuelo el mazo no es tedioso en el sentido de que los mazos tienen muy pocos slots
+ Además de con las cartas que vas encontrando por la aventura, los enemigos tienen mazos temáticos de los que poder aprender estrategias
+ Aunque la ambientación es un poco vieja y 'casposa' cumple para que el juego tenga cierta alma

[h2]Lo que hace el juego cuesta arriba[/h2]
- Aunque es divertido probar nuevas estrategias, eventualmente vas a encontrar una estrategia todopoderosa sin apenas [b]counters[/b]. Lo peor es que además son mazos que no son especialmente divertidos de jugar, llevando a encuentros tediosos que ya sabes que vas a ganar.
- En relación a esto, algunos combates conducen a una inevitable parálisis de tablero, aunque afortunadamente el juego tiene mecánicas para que no sean literalmente eternos.
- [b]Falta total de QoL[/b]. Dificultad para encontrar la información cuando la necesitas, imposibilidad de guardar configuraciones de mazos, no se puede navegar por el mapa de la aventura, algunas mecánicas cuesta entenderlas, etc
- La sensación de [i]cringe[/i] en el desarrollo de la trama y los diálogos es un poco inevitable

[h2]Lo peor[/h2]
Tuve que abandonar el último combate de la última campaña.

En general hay algunos picos de dificultad que no están muy bien gestionados. No es que el juego sea mucho más difícil, es que hay algún combate que en el punto en el que estás, necesitas, además de tener el mazo adecuado, repetir hasta que el RNG te sonría. 

Esto me parecería un motivo suficiente para no recomendar el juego. Pero poniéndolo todo en una balanza, creo que si uno va preparado a que puede encontrarse eso en algún combate puntual, el resto de la experiencia puede ser disfrutable si este es el tipo de juego que siempre quisiste jugar, aunque su estado no sea el ideal. | Ностальгия.

 | The game also comes with a DLC, which includes the following items:

1. A Toxic Community: Mistakes are rarely forgiven. Unless you’re playing with friends, be prepared to face harsh criticism, often from younger players. The game’s multiplayer is largely populated by school-aged players who don’t hold back.


2. Disruptive Adults: It’s not just the kids causing chaos—some adults blast music through their microphones, assuming everyone else shares their taste. Spoiler: they don’t.


3. Frequent AFKs: Teamwork can fall apart when a teammate goes inactive, whether they’re brewing tea, taking a smoke break, or simply wandering off mid-game. And yes, it often happens right after you’ve generously used your first aid kit on them.


4. Team Abandonment: Lone wolves running off to the far corners of the map, only to be overwhelmed by infected, are a common sight. They’re quick to flood the chat with colorful language before rage-quitting the game.


5. Difficulty Disputes: Some players join games on ""Expert"" difficulty only to demand a downgrade. If their request is denied, they might sabotage the team before leaving the server entirely.


6. Vote Kicks: Occasionally, you’ll encounter players who inexplicably start a vote to kick you from the game. When you ask why? Crickets.



The Verdict: Despite the chaotic community, Left 4 Dead 2 remains a phenomenal experience. The graphics are a significant step up from the first game, the mechanics feel more polished, and there’s a greater variety of weapons and infected to enjoy. However, surviving the online experience without a calming remedy might be just as challenging as surviving the zombie apocalypse itself. | [h1]写了800字的推荐文，手欠点了一下""否""全没了。不说了血压高了,头晕。[/h1]总之就是《关于一个萌新GMOD玩久了无聊直接去玩L4D1多人因太菜反复被僵尸虐而被队友抛弃伤心自责卸载游戏过半年好奇进L4D2知道玩单人熟悉官图及玩法过程中发现了能打MOD结果一发不可收拾地搜各种进阶攻略教程提升自己游戏体验和能力努力不坑队友可仍然很菜但是很感谢带萌新入坑的朋友们以及创意工坊的大佬们给这游戏第二次生命的事》 | Крутая игра для игры с друзьями (которые в это не играют)! Есть редкие достижения, куча пушек и толпа зомби, которая будет медленно наступать на пятки и их съедать. В общем, весело, рекомендую. | Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D2), released by Valve in 2009, is the gold standard for cooperative zombie shooters. Featuring intense survival gameplay, smart AI, and an incredible atmosphere, L4D2 delivers an unmatched multiplayer experience. With its fast-paced action, diverse weapons, and unpredictable enemy encounters, this game remains one of the most thrilling and replayable co-op shooters ever made.

Gameplay – Pure, Adrenaline-Fueled Action
L4D2 is all about co-op survival. You and three teammates must fight through hordes of the undead, navigating through various maps and completing objectives to reach safety. The key to survival? Teamwork, strategy, and adaptability.

The gunplay is tight and satisfying, with a wide selection of weapons including assault rifles, shotguns, SMGs, sniper rifles, and melee weapons like axes, katanas, and even frying pans! Every encounter feels dynamic, thanks to the AI Director, which adjusts the difficulty based on your team’s performance, ensuring no two playthroughs are ever the same.

Special Infected – Enemies That Keep You on Edge
Beyond the standard zombie horde, L4D2 introduces Special Infected that force players to work together:

Tank – A massive brute that can throw debris and crush survivors.
Witch – A terrifying enemy that, if startled, can instantly incapacitate a survivor.
Smoker – Uses a long tongue to drag players away from their team.
Hunter – A fast, agile infected that pounces on survivors and pins them down.
Boomer – Explodes in a shower of bile, attracting a massive horde.
Charger – Charges through groups, slamming a survivor into the ground.
Spitter – Creates pools of acid that deal heavy damage.
Each Special Infected forces different team strategies, making communication and positioning absolutely crucial.

Campaigns & Maps – A Horror Movie Experience
L4D2 features multiple campaigns, each set in diverse, apocalyptic locations across the southern U.S.:

Dead Center – A chaotic mall escape reminiscent of classic zombie films.
The Parish – A tense race across New Orleans to reach an evacuation zone.
Swamp Fever – A creepy, foggy swamp filled with infected dangers.
Hard Rain – A unique campaign featuring a devastating hurricane that changes the environment.
Dark Carnival – A fan-favorite, featuring a deadly amusement park with a thrilling rollercoaster finale.
Each campaign feels like a mini zombie movie, packed with cinematic set pieces, interactive environments, and intense finales.

Multiplayer & Game Modes – Endless Replayability
L4D2 offers several game modes that keep the action fresh:

Campaign Mode – Classic co-op survival through story-driven levels.
Versus Mode – One team plays as survivors, while the other controls the Special Infected.
Survival Mode – See how long you can last against endless waves of zombies.
Scavenge Mode – A competitive mode where teams race to collect fuel cans while being hunted.
Mutation Mode – Weekly game modifiers that add fun twists to gameplay.
Thanks to modding support and the Steam Workshop, the community has also created hundreds of custom maps, weapons, and campaigns, making L4D2’s replayability practically infinite.

Graphics & Sound – Immersive and Timeless
Even years after release, L4D2’s atmospheric lighting, detailed environments, and gruesome effects hold up well. Zombies react realistically to gunfire, and the sound design is masterful, with eerie background noises, terrifying growls from Special Infected, and intense musical cues that heighten the suspense.

The voice acting and character interactions bring the survivors to life, making them memorable and adding humor to the chaos.

Why Left 4 Dead 2 is a Must-Play
L4D2 is the perfect blend of action, horror, and co-op gameplay. Whether you’re playing with friends or AI teammates, the intense combat, unpredictable enemy encounters, and endless replayability make every match a thrilling adventure.

🔹 Final Rating: 10/10
Left 4 Dead 2 is a masterpiece of cooperative gaming. If you love zombies, action, and teamwork, this is an absolute must-play that still delivers endless fun and excitement after more than a decade.

作为一名机甲游戏的爱好者，我当然也是对HAWKEN充满了期待。
就画面来说，对于处于beta之中的游戏，能够达到HAWKEN这样的水准应该是相当不错的了。无论是光影的渲染，还是细腻的建模和精美的贴图，都能很好的展现游戏的魅力。
不过也许是beta的缘故，游戏的音乐音效显得较为单调，特别是在战斗中。千篇一律的开火声音，乏味的背景音乐，很难调动起玩家的情绪。音效抓不住玩家的神经，经常打着打着就走了神。这一点希望能在以后的版本中得到提高。
另外谈一下游戏性，个人认为HAWKEN的操作在同类游戏中应该是比较顺手的。快速转身系统的设定也很新颖，能够让游戏多出更多的可操作性。各个机甲的设定也都各有特色，道具、武器和机甲本身的配合也较考验玩家的技术。不过可惜的是，游戏中似乎并没有配置近战武器，这多多少少有点令人失望，希望能在以后的版本中加入更多的武器系统。

[b]说了这么多，最后说一下大家比较关心的就是这个游戏的坑钱程度。应该来说，[i]游戏内置货币的基本上在游戏中没有一丁点的作用，除开几件基础道具和武器，几乎所有的武器、道具、部件甚至是机甲涂装都要花现金来购买。[/i]厂商需要赚钱我们玩家都理解，但是处于beta阶段就大张旗鼓的开始坑钱，这实在是令我不解甚至气愤。如果厂商再不对这样恶劣的收费方式进行调整，游戏的寿命不会长久。[/b] | This game is fast paced.

Nothing. Not anymore.

Hawken was a great game with a small but dedicated fan base. Player counts were starting to pick up, youtubers were starting to review the game, and a strong community loyalty bonded players both to the game and to fellow gamers. Unfortunately while this was happening the publishers of the original devs squandered what money was raised on unnecessary, unasked for merchandise. The devs ran out of money, and Hawken development was discontinued.

The game was still fun, but with a floundering playerbase it was difficult to keep it alive. Regardless, with an injection of new players the game could be great once again.

Then Hawken was bought. Our beautiful game, purchased by a dev team renowned for grinding up and milking games for money. This is where I hung up my coat, and called quits. Since then, I've been monitoring Hawken in the hope it will once again ascend to it's former glory.

And what a naieve hope that was. The game was ported to console edition, but it flopped. The steam community was abandoned, and players have lost money and time they invested to errors- errors ignored and unanswered by the devs. Our game has been abandoned by people who cannot even muster the pretense to care.

Hawken, I miss you.

Hawken, I love you.





Hawken, I loved you. | The game is dead.  This is what happens to great games with good concepts, that are put in the hands of incompetent, greedy developers.
How do you screw up a game with this much potential? Awesome graphics and gameplay, great mechs.  I played this game for years and even then the developers were hardly updating.  Shame they cant just give it to another company and let them put in some hardwork and cash in on this game. | RIP 

You were once a great mech game with the amazing potential to be the best. I'm sorry you were built only to be used like a cheap microtransaction freemium whore and tossed aside like garbage. I do not reget spending money on you, although I both lament and rue those decisions. 

Goodnight my sweet. | Awesome Game, only 6 hours in after 2 HOURS both myself, and my best friend decided that a full 30$ investment in the nemesis bundle was a must. but here are some points i would like to make about the game:

- Great Dev Support and community interaction

-Great Gameplay

-Doesnt feel pay2win(p2w), as i often have been outmatched by the default mech even with my fully customized assault mech (courtesy of the nemesis bundle!)  

-The game provides VARIETY in maps(although i wish there were alot more for TDM!) and the pacing and gameplay is always fluid and the registration and everything is very on point (in my opinion)

-Doesnt Get Stale(So far) the game has not got boring at all, out of town trips and work recently have made me not be able to invest all of the time i wish i could be into this great, free to play, title made by AWESOME devs who seriously have impressed me GREATLY.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I see many people, certainly in the discussion forum for hawken on steam seem to think this game is pay to win, or is unfair to new players. well as i mentioned in some of the many strongpoints i noted this game definately does not feel pay to win at ALL you can pay to customize your mech, as well as your play style. i feel as if a VAST majority of the playerbase can florish in this game even with the most basic mech(the default mech, in this case) and honestly. even if you were to want to grind it honestly isnt that bad. i was too busy communicating with my teamate and enjoying great gameplay to notice. my Review For HAWKEN on steam (Rated By Category)

Gameplay 9/10 ( could use minor improvements,that i am sure will be addressed so i will not go into as they are meager in terms of interruption of my experience/enjoyment with the game)

Visuals 9/10 (Looks great on Low!) But the game is, as stated in the requirements not for the most average gamings pc's, i maintain a steady framerate at medium, high is just a little too much for my Gaming laptop, runs on max on my rig no problem.

f2p Fairness 10/10(while you certainly can buy items with credits purchase by real currency, the game never feels like it is pay to win, and the gameplay is always fair. pay if you feel like investing into your favorite mech(s) or grind the game and earn it!  all  you can pay for is customization and convenience (battlefield for example, in  bad company 2 allowed you to purchase shortcut packs to different classes, and that is a full retail release (AAA) at that so is it so wrong to pay 5,10, or over 9000! on a game that is certainly worth it and completely outdoes its f2p tag.

Controls/Navigation-10/10 i found the controls extremely easy to get used to and all of the default mapping was great for all options, and everything is relatively easy to manage and navigate

Community 9/10- in my first hours of hawken me and my best friend were eager to learn and the community was certainly helpful on not ony the forums but also in game chat. some minor annoyances occured in game with people complaining of 
""Hackers"" or ""p2w losers"" but overall i have had a great experience.
OVERALL SCORE 9/10 Must Try!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for reading, i would also like ot note that i installed hawken purely for a quick fix for titanfall, but soon realised that this game might be the king of mech games afterall, it takes mech combat and gameplay and makes it amazing, without the need for any desire to ever leave your mech(why would you, anyways?!)  this was my first full review and i thank anyone who took the time to read it!, i will hopefully build on it in the future with more examples, notes. but for now, back to the game!

76561197970698176,8850,BioShock® 2,0.5166666666666667,Action,2,"To put simply: my favorite video game of all time.

The first Bioshock is a great game, but it isn’t perfect. It suffers from odd level design and a messy final act. But despite its short development time, Bioshock 2 takes everything great about the first game and streamlines it. Gone are the old PC-era RPG elements and bullet-spongy bosses. The way research works in this game promotes more variety in gunplay, pushing players to try plasmid and weapon combos they might normally not. This makes 2 extremely replayable.

The story here elaborates on a small but important part of Bioshock: the Big Daddies and Little Sisters. Putting you in the shoes of an “old-school” Daddy that supposedly existed before the events of the first game, Delta somehow manages to help us feel so much more than Jack ever did.

Our relationship with Eleanor is moving and organic. Lamb feels like a great successor villain-wise to the loud and proud Ryan. Bioshock 2's story is weirdly similar to Neon Genesis Evangelion, but with a Socialism-fearing American twist. Through themes of fatherhood battling unrighteous use of equality and unity, our actions feel much more fleshed out than the black-and-white “choice” in Bioshock (which is ironic considering that game’s main message). This game makes your choices feel like they really matter.

2 abandons a plot twist and a final boss to focus more on its spectrum of endings, which feel natural based on our choices and their influence. If Delta is good, Eleanor becomes good. If Delta is evil, Eleanor becomes evil. If Delta made mixed/nonsensical choices, Eleanor becomes broken and confused. This is especially great with how thought-provoking some of the choices are: like does Gil deserve to live, or should he be mercy-killed as he previously asked? Not to forget the Mark Meltzer subplot, which is its own whole fascinating journey that was originally revealed through an ARG before 2 released.

The multiplayer is pretty great despite how often people cite it as feeling ""tacked on."" Clearly a decent amount of love was put into it, even if it is unbalanced (all you need is Electro Bolt and the damage-upgraded crossbow).

This was my first Bioshock game, but I think even if I had played the first game first, I’d know that this is the better game. And probably the greatest shooter of all time."" Love is just a chemical, we give it meaning by choice."" Wild that some people think this story is weaker... | Great game but even worse port than the first one. INI tweaks should not be necessary to run without constant crashing. | Fantástico! Bioshock 2 é uma sequência muito mais que digna do primeiro jogo, além de dar um upgrade na jogabilidade, continua a entregar um enredo envolvente com uma história profunda e que levanta reflexões desta vez mostrando o outro extremo, contrário ao ideal individualista de Andrew Ryan. Sophia Lamb não é uma vilã tão marcante quanto o Andrew, mas exerce o seu papel muito bem, trazendo à tona a loucura que é a busca por uma coletividade absoluta. É uma lei universal, é uma característica intrínseca à toda sociedade: todo extremismo produz inevitavelmente um outro extremismo contrário a si mesmo.

(o jogo tem bug que faz ele fechar sozinho em determinado ponto, então antes de começar a jogar procure um tutorial no YT pra resolver logo e não passar estresse, é simples de resolver. | This game has insane storyline and a really good enviromental storytelling. A must play for those who finished the first game and a good game to enjoy. | Гра дуже цікава, великий вибір кастомізації зброї. Також хочеться відмітити що гра складна, навіть на легкій складності вороги будуть вбивати за кілька ударів.",Bioshock 2 is a great game.

Це моє друге проходження, перше було ще в далекому 2013-у і грав я на відрі з гайками, але в пам'яті збереглись спогади та емоції які я відчував під час проходження. Це і стало стимулом зіграти в цю шедевральну гру ще раз. Також хочу сказати що такого красивого неба як у BioShock Infinite я вже давно не бачив ні в одному сучасному проєкті. Більше сказати нічого, 10/10 | Знаешь, есть игры, которые просто включаешь, отстреливаешь пару врагов и такой:''Ну норм''. А есть игры, которые садят тебя в кресло, завязывают глаза, пускают по рельсам и потом выбрасывают с фейерверком в мультивселенную разрыва мозга. BioShock infinite- это как раз про второе.
Тут тее и мультивселенные, и крещение, и парадокс с самого начала игры. Концовка заставляет пересмотреть каждую сцену, каждое решение, каждый чёртов шаг.
В целом, это не просто игра. Это летающий цирк эмоций, философии и крышесносва. Это проект, который заставляет тебя думать, чувствовать и орать в монитор, пока не поймёшь, что ответы тебе никто не даст.
Оценка:12/10 Лучшая экскурсия в облачный ад. | ""BioShock Infinite"" is a remarkable game that combines intense action with thought-provoking narrative and stunning world-building. Released in 2013 by Irrational Games, it builds upon the success of its predecessors while delivering a fresh, yet familiar experience. Set in the floating city of Columbia, the game introduces players to Booker DeWitt, a man tasked with rescuing a mysterious girl named Elizabeth. As the story unfolds, players are thrust into a world of political intrigue, social unrest, and philosophical exploration, with themes ranging from American exceptionalism to the nature of reality itself.

One of the standout features of ""BioShock Infinite"" is its narrative complexity. The plot takes unexpected twists, keeping players on their toes as they navigate the layers of conspiracy and mystery. Booker and Elizabeth’s relationship evolves in a compelling way, and their dynamic drives much of the emotional weight of the story. Elizabeth herself is a unique character, not only because of her abilities—such as opening ""tears"" in space-time—but also because of her depth and growth throughout the game. The bond between Booker and Elizabeth becomes central to the experience, and the way the game unfolds keeps the player invested in their journey.

The world of Columbia is incredibly well-crafted, with vibrant, meticulously detailed environments that stand in stark contrast to the darker themes of the game. The floating city feels like a living, breathing entity, with its own history, culture, and class divides. The design of Columbia, from its patriotic aesthetic to its underlying dystopian nature, provides a striking commentary on American society and the consequences of unchecked nationalism. The game's use of music, especially the incorporation of old-timey renditions of modern songs, further enhances the atmosphere and immersion.

Gameplay-wise, ""BioShock Infinite"" is engaging and intense. The shooting mechanics are fluid, and the introduction of the Skyhook, which allows players to move across railways in the air, adds a unique verticality to the combat. The combination of gunplay, strategic use of Vigors (special powers), and Elizabeth’s ability to open tears creates a dynamic combat system that requires both quick reflexes and tactical thinking. The game encourages exploration, rewarding players with lore, upgrades, and narrative elements that deepen the story.

However, it’s not just the gameplay and world-building that make ""BioShock Infinite"" stand out; it’s also the philosophical depth. The game delves into complex topics like free will, the multiverse theory, and the nature of identity. It challenges players to think critically about the choices they make in the game and how those choices relate to broader existential questions. The ending, in particular, leaves a lasting impact, providing both a satisfying conclusion and a thought-provoking meditation on fate and the consequences of one’s actions.

""BioShock Infinite"" is a masterpiece that blends excellent gameplay with a deep, engaging story. Its themes of freedom, oppression, and the complexity of human nature are explored in a way that feels both personal and universal. The game’s vibrant world, memorable characters, and intricate narrative make it one of the most thought-provoking and visually stunning games of its generation. While it may not appeal to every player, those who appreciate a game that challenges both the mind and the skills will find ""BioShock Infinite"" to be an unforgettable experience.

 [b] 2007 yılında GOTY kazanmış bir oyunla karşı karşıyayız. Tabii ki bu remastered versiyonu yani günümüz ses efektlerine ve grafiklerine ayak uydurabilen hali.[/b]

[h3] Hikâye ve Arka Plan: [/h3]
Oyunun hikayesi, kaliteli bir roman gibi oyuncuyu içine çekiyor. 1960'larda bir uçak kazası sonrası okyanusun ortasında hayatta kalıyoruz, kazanın yaşandığı yerde olan deniz fenerine gitmemiz ile okyanusun altında olan distopik şehir Rapture ile tanışıyoruz. Sözde Ryan'ın '' bireycilik ve özgürlük '' vaadiyle yarattığı bu şehir, kısa süre içerisinde kaosa yenik düşüyor. İnsan doğasının karanlık yanlarını sorgulatan, kapitalizm ve sosyalizm gibi felsefi temaları harmanlayan bir hikâyeye sahip. Özellikle sonlara doğru “Would you kindly?” gibi şok edici bir olayla hikayeye başka bir anlam katıyor. Kısaca karşımızda düşünülmüş ve kaliteli bir hikaye var.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3409545052
[h3] Ses Tasarımı: [/h3]
Ses tasarımı konusunda hiç üzmeyen bir yapım kendisi. Savaştığımız yaratıklar yani splicer'ların ürkütücü fısıldamaları, sesleri ve konuşmaları vs olsun, Big Daddy'lerin metalik homurtaları, yürüyüşleri ve Rapture'un su altı atmosferindeki derin yankılar vesaire olsun başarılı olmuş. Ses tasarımı oyunun atmosferini bir üst seviyeye çıkarıyor.

[h3] Grafik ve Tasarım: [/h3]
Oyunun ilk dakikasından da anlayabildiğimiz gibi grafikleri güzel ve yeterli. Genel olarak aydınlatma ve doku detaylarıyla güzel bir izlenim bırakıyor. Eski versiyonuna göre su efektleri olsun, karakter modellemeleri olsun kısaca geliştirebildikleri her şeyi geliştirmişler ve remastered adına uygun hale getirmişler. Genel olarak 2007'deki versiyonun kaliteli hali olduğunu unutmazsak, Rapture'un art deco mimarisi ve retro-fütüristik tasarımı, zamanın ötesinde bir iş olduğunu hatırlatıyor. 

art deco ve retro-fütüristik tasarımdan kısaca bahsetmek gerekirse şöyle;

art deco: 1920'lerin ihtişamını ve modernizmi yansıtan, geometrik formlar ve lüks materyallerle bezenmiş bir estetik anlayışıdır. Bu tarz, zarif simetriler, parlak yüzeyler ve egzotik desenlerle hem geçmişin büyüsünü hem de çağdaş bir zarafeti bir araya getirir.

retro-fütüristik: Geçmişteki insanların geleceği nasıl hayal ettiğini yansıtan bir estetik anlayışıdır. Bu tasarım yaklaşımı, genellikle 1920’ler ile 1960’lar arasında oluşan geleceğe dair öngörüleri içerir. Özellikle bilimkurgu eserlerinde sıklıkla kullanılan retro-fütüristik tasarım, nostalji ile geleceğin teknolojik hayallerini harmanlar.

Bioshock tasarım konusunda mükemmel bir yapım.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3409671861
[h3] Skill Sistemi ve Geliştirmeler(Plasmidler ve Genetik Modifikasyonlar): [/h3]
Oyunu eğlenceli kılan kısımlardan birisi de karakterimizi genetik olarak modifiye edebilmemiz. Bu modifiyelere plasmid diyoruz. Savaştığımız makinelere ve yaratıklara şok dalgaları gönderebiliyor, onları dondurabiliyor veya arı sürüsü salabiliyoruz. Tabii ki bunlarla kısıtlı kalmıyoruz telepati gücümüzü kullanarak yaratıkların üstüne bir şeyler fırlatarak da hasar verebiliyoruz. Farklı mekanikler farklı oyun tarzları demektir. 

Ek olarak kullandığımız silahları geliştirebiliyoruz ve farklı özellikler ekleyebiliyoruz. Örneğin ben kullandığım İngiliz anahtarına buz yeteneği takmıştım bu sayede vurduğum düşmanlar donuyordu ve öldürmesi daha kolay oluyordu. Kullandığımız ateşli silahlar içinse farklı geliştirmeler var. Silahlardan bahsetmişken de oyunun oynanış süresine göre çeşitlilik yeterli.

[h3] Kontroller ve Mekanikler: [/h3]
Kontroller ve mekanikler genel olarak akıcı. Ben genel olarak çoğu yere koşmaktan çok zıplayarak gittim. Zıplayınca hızım eksilmediği için ve bazı oyunlardan bu oynanışa alışkın olduğumdan böyle oynamak daha eğlenceli geldi. Bir nevi bunny gibi bakabilirsiniz ama o kadar hızlı ve akıcı değil. Mekanik dediğimiz konuya da aslında skill kısmında baya bir değindim. Seçtiğimiz yetenekler ve silahlar ile oynayış tarzımızı şekillendirebiliyoruz. Hatırladığım kadarıyla yeteneklerin arasında daha zor fark edilme gibi şeyler vardı ama sessiz ilerlemek pek bana göre değil. Seven varsa oynarken o yetenekleri seçebilir.

[h3] Düşman Çeşitliliği: [/h3]
Oyunda splicer dediğimiz bir tür var. Bu türün kendi içerisinde farklı güçlerde ve çeşitlerde varyantları var. Bu varyantları kısaca anlatmak gerekirse;
[list]
    [*]Thuggish Splicer: Yakın dövüş silahları ile saldırıyorlar ve hızlılar. Tek saldırmak yerine genellikle 2-3 kişi yani grup halinde saldırıyorlar. Bazı yeteneklerimize bağışıklıkları var ama o kadar zorlayıcı değiller.

    [*]Leadhead Splicer: Ateşli silahlar ile saldırıyorlar bu yüzden de genellikle bizimle mesafelerini koruyorlar. Sağlıkları ise Thuggish türünden biraz daha fazla.

    [*]Spider Splicer: İsminden de anlaşıldığı gibi örümcek gibi takılıyorlar. Oyunun karanlık bir atmosferi olduğu için genellikle karanlıklarda tavanlardan ya da duvarlardan üstümüze atlıyorlar. Yakından savaşabildikleri gibi biraz mesafe ile kanca da fırlatabiliyor. Biraz sinir bozucu bir tür.

    [*]Houdini Splicer: Bu eşekler örümceklerden daha fazla sinir bozuyor. Yaklaştığınızda ya da hasar verdiğinizde ışınlanıp yer değiştirip saldırmaya devam ediyorlar. Işınlanmalarını duman bulutu ile az çok anlayabiliyoruz ama yine de bazen sinir bozabiliyor. Bu arada bu türleri öldürmek genel olarak zor değil, toplu olarak saldırdıklarında bazen sinir bozucu oluyorlar.

    [*]Nitro Splicer: Ve son olarak bizlere el bombası ya da yanıcı bomba atan varyant. Telekinesis gücümüzle bombalarını geri onlara fırlatınca pek bir esprileri kalmıyor.
[/list]

Splicer'ların davranışları, ses ve görüntü tasarımları başarılı. Bazen kendi aralarında laf atışmasına girmeleri de hoş olmuş.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3409674869
[h3] Hikâyenin Derinliği: [/h3]
Uzaktan bakıldığında FPS oyunu gibi gözükse de, aslında çok daha derin bir yapıya sahip. Andrew Ryan'ın idealleri ve Fontaine'in manipülatif planları, oyunda insan doğasını ve etik seçimlerini sorgulatıyor. Hikayenin sunduğu ahlaki ikilemler, Little Sister'lar üzerinde daha da belirgin. Kurtaracak mısınız yoksa hasat mı ediceksiniz ? :)

Hikayeyi derinleştiren diğer bir unsur, çevresel anlatım. Genel olarak linear bir yapıya sahip olsa da bölümlerde ek kısımlar var. Yani birazcık keşfedilecek yerler eklemişler. Bazen geçmişten gördüğümüz halüsinasyonlar olsun, etrafta gördüğümüz ve bulduğumuz eski yaşantılar olsun bir zamanlar mutlu ve güzel bir yaşamın olduğunu gösteriyor. Bizlere o eski ihtişamı güzel bir şekilde gösteriyor. Rapture'un nasıl çöktüğünü gözlerimiz önüne sunuyor.

 [b] Kısaca Bioshock kesinlikle oynanması gerekilen oyunlardan birisi. Etkileyici grafikleri, tasarımları, hikayesi ve oynanışı ile kesinlikle bir şans vermeniz lazım. [/b]

[h1] Puanım 94/100 [/h1] | A classic shooter with RPG elements that still maintains its old shine! Glad to be replaying the remastered version and interacting with the dark, challenging world of Rapture once more. 

If you're new to the series--welcome, and enjoy the rich plot, twists, turns, and grey characters of the world.

Terrible remaster. 0/10 | Love the game, hate the glitches in this remastered version. The crashing is frustrating and frequent.

76561197970698176,409720,BioShock™ 2 Remastered,0.0,"Action, RPG",0,"[h1] Devam oyunu dediğin böyle olur [/h1]

Serinin ilk oyununu bitirdikten sonra devamında nasıl bir bağlantı var diye merak ediyordum. Bu oyunda tekrardan Rapture'ın derinliklerine yolculuk yapıyoruz. Yani aslında yolculuk yapmıyoruz rapture'ın içerisinde başlıyoruz. İlk oyunu bıraktığımız yerden devam ediyoruz dersek yanlış olmaz. Görsel ve teknik güncellemeler, iyileştirmeler sayesinde hikayeyi daha güzel ve detaylı tanıyoruz. Hikayenin daha fazla derinliklerine iniyoruz.

[h3] Hikaye ve Arka Plan:[/h3]
İlk oyunda, Jack olarak Rapture'ın korkunç sırlarını ortaya çıkarırken Andrew ve Fontaine gibi güçlü karakterleri ortadan kaldırmıştık. Bioshock 2'de ise bu yaşanan olayların üzerinden yaklaşık 8 yıl geçmiş bulunmakta. Hangi yıllarda oynadığımızı oyunların başlarında gösteriyordu dikkat edenler bunu fark etmiştir. Şaşırdığım ve aşırı mutlu eden şey ise bu oyunda bir '' Big Daddy '' olan Deltayı kontrol ediyoruz. Yani ana karakterimiz Big Daddy olan Delta. İkinci oyunun hikayesi birinci oyuna göre daha kişisel bir hikaye. Çünkü asıl amacımız Little Sister olan Eleanor'u korumak ve kurtarmak.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3410322464
Hikaye, Sophia Lamb adında bir antagonist ile şekilleniyor. Benim gözümde kendisi yine kendini bilmez ilk oyunun boss'larına benziyor. Kendi hedefi için gerekirse Rapture'u yok edebilecek birisinden bahsediyoruz. Böyle diyince aklıma Griffith'i getirdi :d. Lamb, Ryan'ın bireycilik odaklı felsefesinin tam zıttı bir anlayışı savunuyor. Topluluk odaklı bir ideolojiyi benimsiyor. Ama bunu yaparken dediğim gibi her zaman kendi önceliğini düşünüyor. Topluluk ideolojisi adı altında onun için çalışanlara biz aileyiz vesaire şeklinde konuşup askerlerinin fedakarlık yapmasını istiyor. Manipüleci birisi olduğunu da unutmayalım.

[h3] Hikaye'nin Derinliği: [/h3]
Yukarıda da bahsettiğim gibi, ikinci oyunun hikayesi daha kişisel ve daha duygusal bir temele dayanıyor. Eleanor ile olan bağımız, oyun boyunca hissettiriliyor. Hem hikaye hem de oynanış açısından karakterimizi motivasyon ediyor. Tabii bazı yerler için oyuncuyu da motive ediyor. Sophia Lamb'ın ideolojisi ve eylemleri, Ryan'ın bireycilik felsefesine derin bir tezat oluşturuyor. Bence bu önemli ve hikayeye derinlik katan bir unsur.

Ve en güzel kısımlardan birisi. Oyunda verdiğimiz kararlar Eleanor'un kaderini değiştiriyor. İnsanları öldürecek miyiz yoksa affedecek miyiz ? Aynı şekilde Little Sister'ları hasat mı edicez yoksa kurtarıcaz mı. Bunların hepsi oyuncuya kalmış ve böyle şeylerin oyunu etkilediğini de unutmamak lazım. Verdiğimiz kararlar Eleanor'un etik kararlarını sorgulamasına neden oluyor. Hem kişisel hem de toplumsal temalar işlendiği için, bioshock serisinin felsefi derinliği bu oyunda da devam ediyor.

[h3] Ses Tasarımı: [/h3]
İlk oyunda olduğu gibi bu oyunda da ses tasarımı, atmosfer yaratımında yine harikalar yaratıyor. Big Daddy'nin duyulan adım sesleri, dalgaların derinden gelen yankıları, splicer'ların diyalogları, çıkarttığı sesler, ana ve yan karakterlerin tepkileri ve konuşmaları olsun tatmin ediyor. İlk oyuna kıyasla ses tasarımında daha derin bir ambiyans hissediliyor. Yani ilk oyundan 8 yıl sonra geçtiği için Rapture'ın çürüyen altyapısını daha iyi hissediyoruz. Bu konuda tabii ki su sızıntıları ve mekanik bozulmalar gibi şeyler hikayeyi destekleyen detaylardan birisi.

Ek olarak Garry Schyman'ın bestelediği müzikler yine oyunun en büyük artılarından biri.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3410403327
[h3] Grafikler: [/h3]
Remastered sürüm olduğunu unutmamak lazım. Eski oyunun grafiklerini modern standartlara yakınlaştırmayı başarabilen bir remastered. İlk oyuna kıyasla dokular ve tasarımlar daha net. Işıklandırma efektleri ve çevre tasarımları daha detaylı. Akvaryum benzeri alanlarda gezinirken suyun yarattığı parlaklıkları ve kırılmaları görmek güzel. Kısaca grafiksel geliştirmeler oyun için yeterli ve oyunun atmosferine büyük bir katkı sağlıyor.

[h3] Skill Sistemi:[/h3]
İlk oyundan Plasmid'leri hatırlıyoruz. Devam oyununda ise bu sistemin geliştirilmiş bir halini kullanıyoruz. Yeni plasmid'ler ve eski favorilerin geliştirilmiş versiyonları savaşlarda daha fazla stratejik derinlik sunuyor. Big Daddy olarak kullanabileceğimiz silahları, Plasmid'ler ile eşzamanlı kullanma imkanı oyuna farklı bir hava katıyor. Kısaca skill sistemi ve mekanikler sayesinde savaşlar hala çok zevkli.

[h3] Kontroller ve Mekanikler: [/h3]
Hazır mekanikler demişken bu konuya da değinelim. Oyunda Big Daddy olarak oynamak sadece görsel olarak bir değişiklik sunmuyor. Oynanış mekaniğini de doğrudan etkiliyor. Delta olarak daha güçlü, daha dayanıklı ve daha donanımlıyız. En basiti oyunun başından da anlayabileceğimiz gibi Big Daddy'e özel bir silah ile başlıyoruz. Daha güçlü olduğumuz için de savaşırken biraz daha cesur davranabiliyoruz. Kontroller de ilk oyundaki gibi akıcı ve günümüze optimize edilmiş.

Ek olarak oyunun sonlarına doğru Little Sister'ların dünyayı nasıl gördüğünü göstermeleri efsane olmuş. Little Sister olarak kısa bir süreliğine oynuyoruz.

[h3] Düşman Çeşitliliği: [/h3]
Yani düşman çeşitliliği ilk oyuna benzer ama biraz daha değiştirilmiş ve geliştirilmiş versiyonları bizleri karşılıyor. Splicer'lar yine ana tehdit unsurlarından birisi. Ancak bu sefer oyunda Big Sister dediğimiz başka bir düşman türüyle de tanışıyoruz. Big Sister adından da anlaşıldığı gibi Big Daddy'nin kadın versiyonu. Ancak Big Daddy kadar ağır olmak yerine daha hızlı ve daha ölümcül bir düşman. Çok daha çevik ve daha tehlikeli. Sadece bize doğru gelirken çıkarttığı ürkütücü ses bile farklı şeyler hissettiriyor. (Bağıra bağıra geliyor)

Ek olarak oyunun ilerisinde splicer'lar daha zorlayıcı oluyor. Plazmidlerimize karşı farklı savunma yöntemleri oluyor.


Sonuç olarak Bioshock 2 Remastered, ilk oyunun bıraktığı mirası başarılı bir şekilde sürdürüyor. Hatta bazı yönleriyle seriyi daha ileriye taşıyan bir yapım olmuş. Rapture'ın hikayesine yeni katmanlar eklerken, oynanış ve atmosfer açısından da etkileyici ve unutulmaz bir deneyim sunuyor. Geliştirilmiş görseller, daha duygusal ve derin bir hikaye sayesinde mükemmel bir yapım olmuş. Tabii ki bazı şeylerin aynı olması ve aynı yerde geçmesi bazı oyuncuları sıkacaktır ama ben hikayeyi sevdiğimden ve ilgi çekici bulduğumdan öyle bir problem yaşamadım.

 [h1] Puanım 97/100 [/h1] | The game crashes randomly time to time and there is no real solution to fix this. Either ruining the immersion to save every 5 minutes or get used to lose hours of gameplay.. | Утопія - це не місце, а люди
Нажаль коротка, але не менш цікава і хороша видалась історія у цій грі, і все що було чудовим у першій частині - тут стало тільки краще. Кожен аспект, від графіки до ігроладу - покращився, і грати стало приємніше. Сюжет все ще цікавий, але я очікував довшої історії. Тим не менш, це гідне продовження цього світу. | Secondo capitolo della saga. Qui vestiremo i panni di un Big Daddy ( Esatto, quelli grossi vestiti da palombaro, che a solo guardar male le sorelline, vi prendono a schiaffoni in faccia) alla ricerca della ""sua"" sorellina Eleanor.
La storia è ambientata a Rapture dopo la dipartita di Ryan, dove la città si presenta ridotta anche peggio di come l'avevamo lasciata nel primo capitolo. 
La trama è raccontata tramite i soliti nastri trovati in giro, qui scopriremo tutta la storia dietro i vari personaggi.
Le armi disponibili, sono ovviamente proporzionate alla stazza del protagonista, il munizionamento vario ( dai proiettili antiuomo alle mini-torrette), i plasmidi disponibili sono grossomodo gli stessi presenti nel primo capitolo.
I nemici che incontreremo saranno vari, dai ricombinanti già presenti nel primo capitolo ai vari tipi di Big Daddy ( eh si, ve ne sono diversi).
Concludendo, il gioco vale la candela? assolutamente si se siete appassionati della serie e avete giocato al primo capitolo.
La versione remastered, non mi ha dato problema alcuno di stabilità, potendo acquisterei quest'ultima. | Overall Score: 7

76561197970698176,232790,Broken Age,0.0,"Adventure, Casual, Indie",0,"Dieses Spiel bewegt sich zwischen absoluten Spaß und purer Verzweiflung. Manche Rätsel sind einfach so schräg, dass man das Spiel am liebsten nie wieder anrühren würde. Aber die Geschichte ist so fesselnd erzählt, dass man unbedingt weiter kommen will. Also versucht man es und leidet so lange vor sich hin, bis man dann außerhalb nach einer Lösung schaut (wenn man aber denkt, diese findet man so leicht, täuscht man sich. Einige Rätsel sind zufällig, oder zumindest nicht immer gleich. Ich weiß nicht, wie viele Versionen die Entwickler eingebaut haben, aber es dürften einige sein. D.h. wenn man eine Lösung findet, so muss diese nicht zu dem eigenen Spiel passen. Aber immerhin erfährt man so, was der nächste Schritt ist. Dann ist wieder selber tüfteln angesagt).

Die Hauptfiguren sind zwei Teenager. Der Junge stammt aus einer vermeintlich fortschrittlichen Welt, umgeben von Robotern und Technik und einer ""Mutter"" die ihn vor allem beschützen will. Nichts darf ihm geschehen, alles wird kontrolliert. Alles was ihn verletzten könnte, wurde entfernt. [spoiler]  Und so begegnet man in der Küche z.B. Bratpfannen aus Styropor. Die Welt ist künstlich und steril. Er selbst sitzt zum Frühstück als Teenager noch in einem Baby-Hochstuhl und bekommt den ganzen Tag nur Dinge vorgesetzt, die ihn auch ja nicht auf dumme Gedanken bringen und keinen Schritt selbstständig werden lassen.  [/spoiler] 

Das Mädchen stammt aus einer ganz anderen Welt, viel ursprünglicher, gefüllt mit alten Traditionen. [spoiler] So gibt es das Maidenopfern. Junge Mädchen werden aufgehübscht präsentiert, und dann von einem ""Monster"" ausgewählt und verschwinden. Davon verspricht sich das Dorf, von größerem Übel verschont zu bleiben. [/spoiler] 

Sowohl Junge, als auch Mädchen haben ihr Leben satt. Sie beginnen zu hinterfragen, sie beginnen auszubrechen. Und so beginnt das Abenteuer und verändert nicht nur sie, sondern ganze Welten.

Die Figuren sind kunstvoll gestaltet, die Welt ebenso. Farben, Lichter, Einzelheiten - alles ist toll ausgearbeitet. Die Dialoge (und davon gibt es reichlich viele), sind spannend umgesetzt. Hier macht das Spiel sehr viel richtig und vergrault einen nicht durch langweilige Umsetzung. D.h. während die Personen miteinander sprechen, kann man eine sich verändernde Mimik betrachten, die Aufnahme springt hin und her, alles ist lebendig, strahlt Emotionen aus. 

Beide Welten setzen sich mit verschiedenen Themen auseinander. Kontrolle, Regeln, Überwachung, Illusionen, Glaube, Liebe - jede auf ihre eigene Art. So begegnet man Aussagen wie: ""Wir haben da mitgemacht, weil es doch schon immer so wahr"".
[spoiler]
Die Maiden werden dazu erzogen, schön zu sein, zu gehorchen, einfach nur gut auszusehen. Um eben das perfekte Opfer zu sein, für jenen großen Unbekannten, der sie hoffentlich auswählen wird. Sie selbst sind auch sehr stolz darauf, schön zu sein, die beste Kleidung zu haben, am herrlichsten zu duften, einflussreiche Väter zu haben. Sie wollen sich selbst übertrumpfen und eine fühlt sich schöner als die andere. Hohle Puppen, die nicht wissen, dass auch andere Fähigkeiten in ihnen stecken, weil es ihnen nicht vermittelt wurde.  
Ein Baum nimmt die Rolle vieler Problematiken ein. Er könnte durchaus für viele verschiedene ""Minderheiten"" stehen. Eins seiner Themen war das ""Früchte tragen"". Der Baum wird gefragt, warum er keine Früchte trägt. Er antwortet: ""Nicht alle von uns wollen Früchte tragen"". Im Spiel kommen viele aktuelle Themen zusammen (Politik, Religion, Philosophie)  die scheinbar unscheinbar in das Spiel gepackt wurden. Aber die Botschaften sind ziemlich klar, wenn man nicht nur oberflächlich durch das Spiel geht, und bleiben gleichzeitig unaufdringlich (Schlüsse zu ziehen, bleibt einem selbst überlassen. Es ist wie eine Art Sammlung von Gedanken, die jemand hatte und als Anregung zum weiterdenken oder - vor allem mit Kindern - diskutieren gibt - oder die man einfach so stehen lassen kann). [/spoiler] 

Eine Geschichte wäre nicht spannend, wenn es nicht auch einen Widersacher gibt. Und diesen gibt es natürlich auch. [spoiler] Dieser ist vom Typ, ein genetisch richtiges Volk zu erschaffen, eine Blutlinie rein zu halten. Aber trotz aller Sorgfalt fehlt diesem künstlich optimierten Volk etwas, was es nun von den ""Anderen"" haben möchte. Was das ist, beantwortet meiner Meinung nach das Ende des Spiels.  [/spoiler] 

Und so geht man auf eine emotionale Reise voller verschiedener Dinge aus Traum- und Phantasiewelten und auf der anderen Seite einer technisch-fortschrittlichen. Ein Mix aus Fantasy und Since-fiction, Ursprünglichkeit und Fortschritt, gespickt mit Themen, welche die Menschheit (zum einen als Ganzes, zum anderen ganz individuell auf den Einzelnen bezogen) schon immer beschäftigt und beeinflusst haben. 


(Dialoge lassen sich in diesem Spiel überspringen. Längere Laufwege zum Teil beschleunigen. Szenen die man wiederholen muss, können auch ""vorgespult"" werden. Dinge, die ich sehr zu schätzen weiß und mir persönlich wichtig sind, da es doch einiges leichter macht). 
 | Super Spiel. Wer Point+Click mag, und auch auf Rätsel steht , der hat hier Spaß. Ich hatte sehr viel Spaß bei diesem Spiel.

Plus the art style was incredible and the puzzles were challenging but fun. Great game, definitely underrated and I hope that more people play it. | I really loved the classic point and click adventure game!

It’s absolutely scandalous to encounter a game that doesn’t support 4K screens and doesn’t function at all on Linux. 

I’ve taken a screenshot, which I’ve uploaded directly to my website for you to see: [https://www.olivierpons.fr/download/creeper-world-3-2025-02-09-19h55m38s.png](https://www.olivierpons.fr/download/creeper-world-3-2025-02-09-19h55m38s.png). When you launch the game and move the mouse over the menu, the fonts are embarrassingly small—so much so that it’s almost ridiculous and reflects poorly on the developers. 

How is it possible in 2025 to release a game that doesn’t even start up correctly? As someone who has developed a Unity game myself, I’m in a strong position to critique this, as I know exactly what I’m talking about. Adapting to different screen resolutions is one of the most basic aspects of game development. This is simply unacceptable.

I might consider giving a positive review if the font issues are resolved and the game runs properly on Linux. 

The developers claim it’s Linux-compatible, but it’s clear they haven’t tested it thoroughly. The latest version doesn’t work at all on Linux, and I’ve even read on forums that to get it running correctly, you need to revert to a previous version. There’s an entire set of steps required to downgrade and make it functional. It’s baffling that they can label it as “compatible” when it clearly isn’t. This lack of testing on the platform is inexcusable.

While I’ve focused a lot on the Linux issue, the core problem, as shown in my screenshot, is the incredibly small fonts on 4K screens. This suggests one of two things: either they don’t test on 4K screens—which is inconceivable in 2025—or they simply can’t be bothered to optimize the display for high-resolution screens. Either way, it’s unacceptable. 

And to think this is called *Creeper World III*, implying it’s the third iteration of the game. I can’t even imagine what the previous versions must have been like! | Good Game.

If you're meticulous and enjoy micromanaging, this is a great game to play. The mods for this game are also amazing! I highly recommend checking out the steam workshop for this game if you ever feel like vanilla starts to get kinda stale. And while this is my most played game, I DO NOT RECOMMEND GETTING THIS GAME FULL PRICE. Frequently this game goes on sale for like 75% and the base game alone is not worth the price tag especially as a lot of features that most Stellaris players like messing with are behind DLCs so unless there's some part of the game that you're desperate to play with I'd get the base game and any interesting DLC while they're on sale. | So this is exactly the type of multiple month game time negative review that gets screen shot and memed on social media, but I'm sad to say I mean it in the most literal sense.  I have enjoyed much of my play time with Stellaris, but I emphatically don't recommend anyone purchase this game in it's current, maximum DLC form.
When this game launched, it was a refreshingly basic 4X. Most of the changes made in the early years all the way to the Nemesis expansion added meaningfully to the gameplay without making it overwhelming and complicated for new players.  Unfortunately recent patches and expansions have unfortunately been hats on hats, mostly adding complexity without adding fun.  I have enjoyed the ride for the most part, but like most Paradox games the continual addition of DLC eventually replaces the game you loved with something you barely recognize while draining your wallet. | 肥肠好的游戏，使我的巨像旋转，之前玩的盗版，现在终于史低补票（仅本体）了，但P社的DLC是真贵，只能用学习版，等有钱了慢慢补票吧。 | I have a theory that if you spend enough time in a game, it is disingenuous to give it a negative review.  I don't know what exactly the minimum amount of time is, but I'm confident I've surpassed it, whatever it is.  

I've been with the game since launch, and it has managed to get better basically every year.  The game has always been pretty fun, though a little quirky early on.  The developers have improved it a lot and it is very enjoyable now, if perhaps a little complicated if you've never played a game like this before.  

So, yes, I recommend Stellaris. | [h1]Stellaris[/h1]

[quote][i]Всем привет. Автор не несет ответственности за причиненный вред своими обзорами. Любое сходство с другими обзорами случайно. Данный обзор является лишь мнением автора и вы можете всегда оставаться при своем мнении! Спасибо за понимание и приятной игры![/i][/quote]

[h1]Описание:[/h1]
[i][b]Stellaris[/b] — это смесь грандиозной 4X-стратегии, ролевой игры и интерактивного романа, где вы сами пишете историю своего народа среди звёзд. Разработчики создали  эпическое повествование о взлётах и падениях цивилизации. От первых робких шагов в космосе до управления межгалактической империей — здесь есть место всему: дипломатии, войнам, предательствам и открытиям, которые перевернут ваше представление о жанре.[/i]

[b]Основа игры: Механики, которые затягивают на сотни часов[/b]
[i][list]
[*] [b]Создание своей цивилизации:[/b] Stellaris начинается с того, что вы буквально конструируете расу из десятков параметров: этика (милитаристы, пацифисты, ксенофобы), тип общества (биологическое, роботы, псионики), черты (адаптивность, интеллект, агрессия) и даже внешность. Хотите играть за миролюбивых космических слизней, строящих галактическую федерацию? Или за машинную империю, стремящуюся ассимилировать все органические расы? Здесь возможно всё.

[*] [b]Исследование и открытия:[/b] Галактика в Stellaris генерируется случайно, и каждое новое игра — это путешествие в неизвестность. Вы будете:
- Исследовать аномалии (например, древние руины или гравитационные аномалии).
- Встречать кризисы (вторжение внегалактических захватчиков, восстание синтетиков).
- Заключать союзы или уничтожать соседей.

[*] [b]Дипломатия и войны:[/b] 
- Дипломатия: От торговых соглашений до создания федераций — здесь можно решать судьбы галактики без единого выстрела.
- Войны: Система военных целей позволяет вести не тотальные войны, а конфликты с чёткими задачами (захват системы, освобождение вассала).
- Шпионаж и провокации: Саботаж, кража технологий, поддержка повстанцев — идеально для любителей «тихих» конфликтов.

[*] [b]Экономика и управление:[/b] 
- Балансировка ресурсов (энергия, минералы, пища, потребительские товары) — основа процветания.
- Планирование заселения планет, строительство мегасооружений (кольцевые миры, сферы Дайсона) и управление населением с уникальными потребностями.
[/list][/i]

[i][b]Сильные стороны: Почему Stellaris покоряет сердца[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]Нарративная глубина:[/b] События в игре — это не просто текст, а истории с последствиями. Например, обнаружение «Храмового комплекса» может привести к пробуждению древнего бога-червя, который переформатирует вашу расу, или к гибели всего живого в секторе.

[*] [b]Реиграбельность:[/b] Благодаря случайной генерации галактики, сотням событий и возможности создавать уникальные цивилизации, каждая партия кардинально отличается от предыдущей.

[*] [b]Моддерская поддержка:[/b] Stellaris обладает одной из самых активных моддерских сообществ. Моды добавляют новые расы, сюжеты, механики и даже полностью меняют сеттинг.

[*] [b]Постоянное развитие:[/b] Paradox регулярно обновляет игру, исправляя ошибки и добавляя новые фичи. Даже спустя 7 лет после релиза Stellaris остаётся актуальной.
[/list][/i]

[h1]Плюсы:[/h1]
[i][list]
[*] [b]Беспрецедентная свобода творчества:[/b] Создавайте уникальные расы с собственной этикой, чертами и историей. Хотите играть за пацифистов-грибов или машин-уничтожителей? Всё возможно. Проработанная система происхождений (например, «Потерянная колония» или «Синтетическая эволюция») задаёт тон всей партии.

[*] [b]Нарративная глубина:[/b] Сотни случайных событий, археологических цепочек и кризисов превращают игру в космическую сагу. Истории в духе научной фантастики: от восстания ИИ до встречи с божественными червями.

[*] [b]Реиграбельность:[/b] Случайная генерация галактики, разные типы кризисов (вторжение Пожирателей, Восстание машин) и бесконечные комбинации рас обеспечивают уникальность каждой партии.

[*] [b]Дипломатия и взаимодействие:[/b] От создания федераций до подрывных операций — здесь есть инструменты для любой стратегии. Возможность играть без войн, побеждая через культурное доминирование или политические интриги.

[*] [b]Моддерская поддержка:[/b] Огромная библиотека модов: от новых рас и кораблей до полных переработок вселенной (например, «Star Trek» или «Warhammer 40K»).

[*] [b]Атмосферность:[/b] Эпичный саундтрек, стилистика кораблей и планет, голосовые оповещения — всё это погружает в атмосферу живой галактики.

[*] [b]Постоянное развитие:[/b] Paradox регулярно обновляет игру, добавляя новые механики и исправляя ошибки.

[*] [b]Достижения:[/b] Присутствие получения различных достижений, что добавляет элемент соревновательности и мотивации с другими игроками которые смогли получить сложные достижения с особыми условиями.

[*] [b]Коллекционные предметы:[/b] Присутствуют обои, смайлики, карточки из которых можно скрафтить значки
[/list][/i]

[h1]Минусы:[/h1]
[i][list]
[*] [b]Высокий порог вхождения:[/b] Десятки ресурсов, технологий и механик могут перегрузить новичков. Обучение в игре поверхностное.

[*] [b]Проблемы с оптимизацией:[/b] На поздних стадиях игра начинает лагать, особенно в больших галактиках. Мультиплеер часто страдает от десинхронизации.

[h1]Заключение:[/h1]
[i]Stellaris — это не просто игра. Это симулятор бесконечности, где каждая звезда может стать домом для новой цивилизации, а каждый чёрный ящик — хранить секреты, способные изменить галактику. Да, здесь есть проблемы с балансом и оптимизацией, но когда ваш флот из тысяч кораблей вступает в бой с внегалактическими захватчиками под эпичную музыку, вы понимаете: это не просто код и спрайты. Это — настоящее космическое приключение.[/i]

why bother save em if they are broken! | Nosferatu: The Wrath of Malachi é o jogo que eu estava procurando por grande parte da minha vida, provavelmente! Ele tem uma gameplay única, focada em busca de itens, gerenciamento de recursos e uma exploração de cenários muito divertida (ou, talvez, seria mais adequado dizer ""evitar os malditos que ficam spawnando do lado da porta"").

O jogo gira em torno de você limpar cada grande prédio e resgatar seus familiares. Cada um dos seus familiares concede novos itens para melhorar seu personagem, e eles aparecem em lugares diferentes a cada nova run! O que torna tudo mais divertido! Na verdade, praticamente tudo no jogo é baseado em RNG, o que faz com que o replay seja muito atrativo. Ultimamente, fala-se muito dos ""rogue-likes"" como sendo os únicos jogos que utilizam RNG, mas, honestamente, não entendo por que não existe um Nosferatu-like. A forma como o jogo lida com combate (mesmo que limitado pela época), cenários, história e recursos é extremamente divertida, sem deixar de lado o sentimento de progresso!

Curiosamente, o jogo recente que talvez mais se aproxime da proposta de Nosferatu é Granny, e talvez seja o único nos últimos anos? É um caso de estudo interessante e um tipo de level design que eu gostaria de ver mais por aí.

RECOMENDADÍSSIMO! | Jank but very fun. If you buy this, play on easy to learn attack patterns and the early locations of helpful stuff like the flintlock pistol. Loading quicksaves is very strange, since enemy spawns get randomized every time you load for some reason. | Moral of the story, don't go to romania | I will be honest about my experience with this game. I hated it. I don't get why this game has more positives than negatives I hated my experience with the game. I hated the random enemies coming out to kill you. The enemies that just charge at you with no brain at all are just evil. I hated doors locked unless you had a certain key to get it open. I hated the fact every time you find someone they block your screen with dialogue while you're being attacked. I hated the fact you have limited time to find a certain person before they die. The AI with NPC's are bad since they don't follow you unless you kill an enemy. Why the game developers thought it was a good idea for an FPS game that's a horror game to be a roguelike is beyond me. It's not fun dying to restart all over again for something else to happen. The weapons can be awful because If you have a full clip you reload wasting ammo. The machine gun is the best weapon but it can't hurt those shadow creatures unless you use a chalice or a crucifix. There is luggage but you need to find certain people to get what's inside and some of these items are limited so getting them to be gone in a few minutes when you get them. I managed to finally beat it but 2 people died because I wasn't fast enough to figure out the confusing layout of the map. I hate this game here. I do not want to play it ever again.

76561197970698176,249380,Unknown,1.15,,4,"Играл во все части Carmageddon, как говорится, на старте. Оригинальная Карма является моей одной из самых любимых игр на равне с DOOM. Очень обрадовался когда узнал что те же люди делают ремейк, можно сказать мечтал об этом, а тут бац - мечта сбылась. Не играл в игру до релиза, хотя и купил еще на стадии раннего доступа. 

Что могу сказать по поводу нового Carmageddon?  Некий сплав из первой и второй части на новом движке, а по сути тот самый мясной, кровавый, ураганный, великий и могучий Carmageddon!!!
Мягко говоря был разачарован оптимизацией на момент релиза и уже было подумал, что разработчики игру забросят, но после августовского апдейта игра преобразилась. Ее серьезно оптимизировали, за что разработчикам честь и хвала. Свежий апдейт еще не пробовал, но думаю все стало еще лучше. Разработчики молодцы что не бросают игру, а постоянно ее улучшают.   

Не понимаю людей которые наиграв полтора часа пишут гневный обзор. Да, у игры были проблемы с оптимизацией, но ключевое здесь слово - были. Игра шикарна, если нравился Carmageddon, то реинКАРнация понравится обязательно.
Да и тем кто ни разу не играл в Карму настоятельно рекомендую, т.к. аналогов просто нет. А еще и PC эксклюзив)

10 педестрианов из 10. | Не оправданно непопулярная игра. 
Сказывается недостаток рекламы, т.к. после первых частей прошло очень много лет, уже и не надеялся увидеть перерождение серии, как вдруг неожиданно она появляется в стиме как раз на мой день рождения =)
Купил еще в пре-альфа версии, не пожалел ни разу, получил именно то, чего ожидал. За все время ни разу не вайпнули прогресс прохождения, а ведь были глобальнейшие обновления.
Совсем недавно добавили +2 машины в игру. Некоторые жидокомпании назвали бы это DLC и стали продавать их отдельно, но эти ребята молодцы - прислали их обычной обновой!
Многие жалуются на оптимизацию, вы там на калькуляторах пытаетесь ее запустить? На дворе 2016-й год, не пытайтесь в нее играть на компе 2008-го, не получите нужного удовольствия от игры. У меня на не совсем уже свежем i5, gtx660 игра работает без нареканий, даже время загрузки уровней заметно сократили с последними обновами.
Да, минусы есть, но это скорее придирки, поэтому упоминание о них опущу. Отмечу только, что в игре есть особенность, можно сказать необходимый ""минус"" - это гравитация. Почему? Потому что машины ощущаются как матрасы на колесах (слишком легкие), но от этого не уйти, т.к. очень много всяких трамплинов и интересных мест и бонусов, и чтобы залететь, например, на крышу здания или проехаться по вертикальному кольцу машина должна быть ""легче"".
В общем не стоит игру обходить стороной и купить если даже и не по фулл прайсу, то по скидке от 40%. Кидайте в список желаемого не задумываясь.
Очень надеюсь на продолжение.
Если мой отзыв не оказался полезным, то, как минимум, игра получила +1 Like от меня и крохотную прибавку к статистике отзывов.
У меня всё, спасибо. =) | Наконец-то игра вышла. Хоть и бетаверсия. В общем не зря я ждал ее почти год. Играется все так же весело, как и в 1997 году. Все тоже мясо, тачки и бонусы. Оптимизация пока хромает, конечно. На пред-максимальных настройках графики выдает около 40 FPS, хотя видеокарта GTX 970. Но это все мелочи. Эта игра создана для фана, расслабона после работы)  Ветеранам Кармы должно понравиться. Молодежи тоже могу рекомендовать. Такого больше нигде нет. Надеюсь разработчики не будут забывать про игру, будут ее развивать и расширять контент и в дальнейшем. Если и не патчами, то хотя бы DLC.

UPD от 11.03.15 Оптимизация не увеличилась ни на йоту, как бы прискорбно это не было. Насчет использовний power-up соперниками - за один заезд тоже не увидел. Ребята вели себя как подобает - как мясо :) | Ну вот настал день, когда игра торжественно перешла в стадию беты. Если сравнивать с предыдущей версией... это пожалуй сравнимо, с тем, как если бы до этого я играл в скромную демку, не более. Хотя над оптимизацией еще работать и работать (дико фризит иногда, в зависимости от размеров карты, хотя это учитывая то, что у меня комп древнее динозавров - кора двух дубов Е8400, гтх650 и 4 гига оперативы).
Не смотря на фризы, это теперь полноценная игра, со свежедобавленными карьерой, улучшениями, статистикой, достижениями, мультиплеером, кучей тачек и карт и наконец-то из музыка представлена более чем одной песней (а где бы найти этот саундтрек?), в общем, Карма теперь вполне себе играбельна, но очень надеюсь на оптимизацию, и так на минималках гоняю...
Как давний фанат Кармы (черт возьми, да это вообще первая игра, в которую я играл на компе!), скажу: меня здесь все устраивает, и это даже не ХД-ремейк первой части, а именно что новая часть, с новыми фишками, машинами, улучшениями и др., хотя я и банального римейка дико ждал все эти годы. Проработка деталей поражает, каждая машина уникальна, все больше и больше замечаешь новые мелочи в дизайне, в механике по мере покатушек; пешеходы стали куда живучее (ибо вполне могут и без ног ползти дальше и без рук убегать, прямо как черный рыцарь из Монти Пайтон), сбивание жирух на полной скорости может оказаться фатально и для машины, пинболл мод теперь творит еще больший хаос на карте за счет большей интерактивности мира, а чертовы копы то и дело смачно впечатывают в стену. 
Короче, это без сомнения шикарный за свои деньги продукт, вполне уже играбельный и теперь самое время покупать, пока в подарок к ней выдают полный набор оригинальных игр :)
По мне, так она способна угодить и старым фанатам и новому поколению, незнающему великую серию Кармы.
Upd (29/04/15): Ура, оптимизацию завезли! Конечно не до такой степени, чтоб я мог на средне-высоких играть на своем калькуляторе, но на минималках уже комфортно и стабильные 35 фпс почти без фризов!
Upd (06/09/15): Ура, оптимизацию еще раз завезли! Теперь уже до такой степени! Фризы бывают только в самом-самом начале, 1-2 коротеньких, потом все гладко! Ура, графон! | Darauf habe ich seit 16 Jahren gewartet. Ok, der zweite Teil war auch mega, TDR so lala. Aber das hier scheint schon mal ganz vielversprechend zu sein. Das Skandalspiel meiner Jugend ist wieder da und kommt genauso dumm und infantil daher wie damals.

[h1] Геймплей (6/10) [/h1]
Если целью было бы простое прохождение игры, то геймплей можно оценить и выше, но если выполнять все миссии на S ранг со всеми дополнительными задачами, это ужасно. Больше всего раздражали различные баги, которые связаны с поведением НПС: 
- в миссиях, где надо прослушать все диалоги, в один момент НПС могут встать на месте и просто молчать пару игровых часов, а потом разойтись, так ничего и не сказав друг другу;
- различные софтлоки, к примеру, в миссиях, где цель прилетает на вертолете, может получиться так, что вертолет прилетит, а цель из него выходить не будет или же, где по условию задания, в конце миссии надо эвакуировать [u] три [/u] танка, но появляется только [u] два [/u] ;
- враги подрываются на собственных минах, а если трупы найдут их же товарищи, то поднимется тревога.

Все бы ничего если бы, во второй половине игры, не надо было проходить, еще раз часть ТЕХ ЖЕ ПРОШЛЫХ МИССИЙ, но с ПОВЫШЕННОЙ СЛОЖНОСТЬЮ, это портит полностью впечатление от игры под ее конец.

Также в игре, много лишнего и ненужного, я всю игру пробегал с одним и тем же автоматом и с одной и той же винтовкой, изредка меняя винтовку на ракетницу. У меня ни разу не появилась такая игровая ситуация, где мне понадобилось использовать дробовик, пулемет, гранатомет или щит. Та же история с напарниками, способность пса - отмечать врагов в радиусе 100 метров, полностью перекрывает необходимость использовать других напарников. 

Или же вот, дикие животные - вроде хорошая идея, чтобы окружающий мир был более живым, но такое чувство что эту задумку бросили на пол пути и так добавили в игру, потому что части животных в игровом мире вообще нет. И таких довольно крупных особей, как каракал, медоед, лисица и т.д., надо ловить через специальную ловушку, которая размером со ступу Снейка. Почему я должен ловить лису, которой в открытом мире даже не существует, в маленькую клетку, хотя я спокойно могу найти на локации мышь или ежа? Почему бы не добавить одну лису на весь Афганистан и ходи ее и ищи, так было бы намного интереснее, чем сейчас есть в игре.

Спасибо за существование пулемета на вертолете, которым я ни разу не воспользовался, кроме одной миссии, где надо было сюжетно пострелять по-местному евангелиону, но зато в каждый второй миссии об этот пулемет зацепляешься, при попытке спрыгнуть с вертолета, и надо подождать проигрывание анимации доставания и сворачивание этого пулемета.

[h1] Сюжет (10/10) [/h1]
За историей интересно следить, интересно слушать аудиокассеты, а главные и второстепенные герои чувствуются живыми и настоящими. Серьезность игры, в моментах разбавляется японским юмором, в хорошем смысле.

[h1] Графика/анимации и музыка (9/10) [/h1]
Вопросов к графике и анимации - нет, даже сейчас все смотрится довольно красиво и свежо. Что нельзя сказать про музыку, за 120 часов игры, я не могу вспомнить ни один саундтрек, что он есть, что его нет, слух не режет и на том хорошо.

[h1] Заключение [/h1]
Всем советую поиграть в эту замечательную игру. Цена полностью соответствует, тому наслаждению и досугу, что вы получите при прохождении, а если еще и по скидке, то тем более. | I owned this game on release on PS3. It was among the first games I owned on PS4. And, when I got a laptop in college meant for editing and rendering high definition video, I got this game again. And each time I got it, I completed the game start to finish, completing all missions and side missions. 

While obviously, the game wasn't finished and chapter 2 is just a mess, this is by far one of the best action stealth games you can ever purchase. | [h1] Great game [/h1]
I really enjoyed kidnapping people and forcing them to work for me. Also I'm not entirely sure but i think Hideo Kojima worked on this game, they should add more credits. |

 | Kojima is genius
This game is epic

Pros:
-Good gameplay mechanics and I really like the stealth in this game (ignore the fact that sometimes enemies are very stupid and blind)
-""Depressing"" but cool plot
-Some jokes and funny tricks in the game
-Grinding isn't always a good thing, but for some reason I liked it in this game.
-You need to build your own base and improve your people. I didn't expect that in a stealth game, but it's cool.
-lots of interactivity
-D-Doge
-Quiet provides too much fanservice (couldn't help but mention this)

Cons:
-You can't have sex with Quiet
-Dumb and unnecessary multiplayer components

76561197970698176,288160,The Room,3.2666666666666666,"Adventure, Indie",4,"The Room is a puzzle game where you solve a series of intricate puzzle boxes to uncover the secret of A.S., the person who called you to solve them.

The gameplay here is pretty simple: you just solve puzzles. Each stage, you're given one puzzle box, and you have to click around to figure out how each part opens or moves. The puzzles weren't very difficult. The only times I got a little bit stuck were because it wasn't clear that something was movable. There were a few puzzle types that were repeated once or twice, but it didn't happen enough to bore me by the end. 

The Room doesn't have a very developed story, but it is very atmospheric. What story you get comes in the form of notes from A.S., which give you some insight into what they were researching. The game has a mysterious vibe to it that gets creepier as you get further into the levels, from the increasing strangeness of the notes, the changing details of the room around you, and the odd noises mixed in with the background music.

This game was originally a mobile game and the movements you have to make were clearly designed with a touch interface in mind. You have to turn keys and cranks and pull up on lids. You also have to move the camera around to see the puzzle boxes from all sides or to line elements up a certain way for some of the puzzles. I played on a computer with a mouse, so some of those movements felt a little awkward. It was also a little annoying to have to adjust the camera so much to see certain things straight on.

Overall, I liked The Room. While the puzzles weren't difficult, I wasn't bored with them, and I enjoyed the creepy atmosphere. Although it was a bit short, I felt like I got a decent value out of the game, and I'm really curious to see what the rest of the series will have to offer. 7/10 | This is one of if not my favourite puzzle game. It's not too long and that is a huge plus. It knows it doesn't need two houndred hours of content to be good and it shows how much dedication they have put in the game with the few hours of pure quality in it | Fun game that can be challenging, but still add depth without feeling stymied! | An excellent puzzle game in concept and execution. Would love to see many more like it. If you love real life puzzle boxes and mechanical puzzles this can scratch that kind of itch with things taken to the somewhat movie style fantastical with what is possible but fitting for something you can suspend disbelief for and enjoy. | If you enjoy a challenging point and click puzzle game with an impressive amount of lore and backstory, i would highly recommend this.

Este, Dark Side, tiene la particularidad de que en lugar de controlar a los buenos llevas a los malos del cuento. Pero es un gimmick que cambia muy poquito el desarrollo o la mecánica del juego. Más allá de llevar a un vampiro, un orco o una demonia, Dark Side ofrece exactamente lo mismo que el resto de los títulos de la saga. Y eso no es malo. Para mí, que soy adicto a esta droga, es estupendo. Pero al mismo tiempo soy plenamente consciente de estar enchufándome un entretenimiento completamente vacuo y entumecedor, que rasca un rinconcito muy específico de mi cerebro. | Поставил сложный уровень сложности - тебя развалил гном перед вратами. Поставил нормальный уровень сложности -  тебя снова развалил гном перед вратами. Поставил лёгкий уровень сложности - всё верно, тебя всё ещё развалил гном перед вратами. Очень интересная игра, 10 развалов из 10. | Да, посоветую тем у кого много свободного времени. | Ладно, ладно.... Игру я всё же прошёл...

Наверное самая слабая часть из всей серии. Хотя будь она любительским модом - вопросов было бы меньше, а так всё же полноценный официальный спинофф. 
Да, кстати те 3 боя в самом начале из-за которых я хотел дропать игру - самые сложные. Если пройдёте их (речь, конечно же про воина), то остальную игру пролетите одной левой. Оказалось супер просто и даже скучно. 

Что же с игрой не так? Да почти всё не так. 
Да, в базе это та самая кингс баунти, да, на бумаге очень оригинальная идея, да самостоятельная, независимая часть, но как же всё в реализации откровенно слабо. 
Про баланс уже написал в самом начале, стоит добавить, что вся игра сводится к таланту 15% на половину отряда врага. Вражеские отряды буквально имеют тысячные кол-во, срубать это эффективно только проками с аое или дотами. А всё остальное время нужно просто бадиблочить вражеских стрелков. Всё, это схема боя на 99% сражений. 
Враги буквально надоедают однотипностью. Я думал задушусь убивать нежить в ВС, но на деле я задушился в ТС на эльфах, учитывая эти неадекватные цифры в армиях и абсолютно 1 в 1 тактику боя. 
Шкатулка (так я называю механику ярости, в этой же части это Черныш) просто бесполезный мусор. Вроде и дают талант на 90% откат в 1м раунде и можно кастовать по 5-6 раз, но на деле все абилки на дамаг будут врагу как по женскому детородному органу ладошкой. (2-4к урона по армии из 1к+ рыцарей). Эффективными будут только 2 скила на процент урона и тотем девицы, его я называю тотемом суеты. Всё остальное - чисто от скуки, ну или щит неплохой выдать. 
Так же куда-то пропали часть юнитов из ВС, при этом новых особо не завезли, а тех что завезли - достанешь дай бог под конец. Где снежные эльфы? Где 2 вида злобоглазов? Даже циклопов видел только у врагов. В целом в игре мало магазинов, в которых должно что-то рандомиться. Из-за этого сложно найти нужные вещи и юнитов. Типа идея в том, что можно закупать и развивать всё в хабе, но нет, далеко не всё. 
Так же в игре нельзя играть за светлых. В игре будет их аналог 1 в 1, но называться они будут тёмными, иметь затемнённый вид и открываются только после захвата острова. А ещё они ограничены и порой даже остро. 
Отдельный камень в огород, а лучше сразу по руками тому гению, кто решил убрать у диспела возможность снимать доты. При этом добавил новую. Единсвтенное назначение скилла и то убрали. Зачем? Кто просил? Надеюсь этот человек больше не балансит игры. 

Сюжет. Как уже говорилось: на бумаге неплохо, но реаализации совсем плохо. В целом игра проходима, есть неплохие, даже забавные текста, персонажи, но всё прохождение сводится к одной и той же схеме: найди злых союзников, перебей всех добрых. Всё, так до конца игры, повторить почти на каждом обязательном острове. Да, есть там неплохие моменты, но их как капля мёда в бочке. 
Общая часть диалогов написано пресно и, что ещё хуже, в бесконечных пасхалках и отсылках, даже иногда с разрушением 4й стены. Это прикольно раз-два, но не когда у вас это в каждом 3м диалоге. 
Завезли, кстати, новые иконки персонажей, этого не хватало после ВС, где видишь в 3й раз те же самые лица но с другими ролями. Только вот тоже моментик: все они отфотошопленные лица разных людей, в том числе знаменитостей. Выпустили бы это сейчас - все бы говорили, что какая-то хреновая нейросеть. Халтура? Халтура. 

Отдельная очень важная инфа про квесты. Хотя много кто уже это отметил, но в них нет нормального описания. Если ты не прочитал в 1й раз его в диалоге с персонажем, то иди потом сам делай что хочешь и ищи где хочешь. В журнале толком ничего не будет. Я понимаю, что к тому моменту уже вышло 2 части дарк соулс, и людям, которые любят квесты в дарк соулс такой стиль зашёл бы, но будем честны, НИКТО НЕ ЛЮБИТ ДЕЛАТЬ КВЕСТЫ В ДАРК СОУЛС. И никто не делает их самостоятельно. Только вот в отличии от дарк соулса у КБ нет вики с подробным описанием что и куда (есть обычная, но там информации никакой нет), поэтому приходилось играть в 2м окне с прохождением, и если начинался затуп (читать всегда) или возвращаешься к старому квесту - читаешь его. Лучше способа нарушить атмосферу игры не придумать. 
Ещё пару камней в квесты у игры: Они могут иметь свою последовательность и квесты на трату золота или привести тип армии. Вот последних очень много и они некоторые не дают ничего. Просто ничего, абсолютно. Особенно весело в начале игры искать по 30к, 100к, что бы пройти ОСНОВНОЙ СЮЖЕТ. Это такой бред, благо под конец игры с деньгами проблем нет, но в начале это заставляет думать куда идти пофармить. 
Баги. В игре их немного, и игра спокойно проходится. В отличии от ВС она почти не вылетает(но всё же вылетает), но есть свои неприятности. Например что-то где-то не подбирается. Какая-то последовательность квестов не работает, юниты застревают, ландшафт с кривыми мостами, на которых постоянно застреваешь и вот такие мелочи. Звук у амазонок например, эта азбука морзе... Пришлось удалять их звуковые эффекты. Так же на них не работает баф на урон от луков. Они же с луками, в чём проблема? Но увы, не работает. С звуком, кстати, в игре вообще отдельная проблема. На пиратском острове например играет один и тот же трек, с которого в дурку уедешь через 10 минут. Пришлось лезть в файл Плейлист и самому всё настраивать. А в конце мне даже не дали ачивку за бой без книги магии. Я её не трогал, но ачивку не получил. Обидно. 

Но всё же, хоть это и слабейшая часть, я её всё же рекомендую для тех, как и я, кто после 3х частей хочет ещё. Кто не наигрался в этот прекрасный, фентезийный мир. Кто не накидался скилами и не начитался диалогов. Да, тут это всё слабее, вайб упущен сильно, но это и поможет конкретно ""наиграться"" в КБ. 
К сожалению тот самый мощный вайб из ЛоР, когда у тебя там всего 2-3 лучника, пара мечников и ты дерёшься с растениями, дракончиками, волками, потом становишься сильнее, идёшь драться уже с нежитью и так по нарастающий, пока не заканчиваешь победой над злыми демонами и драконами с огромной армией - вот этот мощнейший вайб настоящей фентезии истории... им тут даже не пахнет. Он в целом начинал теряться ещё в ПвД, чуть вернулся в ВС и полностью домирает в ТС. 
Поэтому дополнительно, т.к. это последняя часть сделаю так же небольшую оценку всех 4х частей. 
Примерно так:
ЛоР>ПвД>ВС>ТС 
(Если бы ВС не имело жестких тех проблем с вылетами, то был бы лучше ПвД, но увы)
Очень бы хотелось, что бы вот была игра как ЛоР по вайбу, но геймплейные фишки были из всех частей и что бы игра часов на 200. Вот это была бы пушка. Возможно такой должна была бы стать КБ 2, но увы, там совсем другая игра, которую ещё придётся пройти. Ну а с этой серии пока закончили, все части стоит пройти, даже эту, самую слабую.  | Fajna gierka, jak lubicie latać tam i spowrotem jak kurier Telepizzy, bo jakis zjeb podrzucił włos do pizzy.

76561197970698176,291410,Unknown,16.75,,7,"When it comes to Duelyst, the comparison with Hearthstone is easily made. The way you earn cards is the same, the ranked system is the same, the mana system is the same and the way classes work is the same, complete with special power.

However, there's a few very key differences between the two games that make Duelyst less random and, to me at least, more fun: The board on which you play as well as the ability to replace a card from your hand once per turn.

The board in combination with the various cards makes for some really deep and satisfying tactical play that allows you to bend the game to your favour with smart decisions. Every turn the board looks different as there's so much going on and every turn has a very large amount of decisions that you can make. I really enjoy this the most as a fervent tactical turn-based gamer. If you like the combat in XCOM and Age of Wonders 3, you will find lots to love here.

Other plusses are the quick matchmaking, the active developers, the gorgeous pixel art and animations and the large amount of interesting lore.

I am personally not a fan of random stuff (which is why I stopped playing Hearthstone) and to me Duelyst strikes the perfect balance between randomness and tactics. Highly recommended! | Abosultely love this game! The strategy needed due to the infinite possibilities between the game board, placement of ""cards"", and of course the kick @$$ pixel graphics!!  A very satisfying game that could easily be played and enjoyed without spending a penny of ""real money"".  The daily quests (and free card) can get you enough gold to buy spirit orbs (card packs), gauntlet tickets (arena/draft play) and bloodborn orbs (card packs with cards you DONT have!).  Yes, if you get a crate you need a key to open it which costs $4.99.. BUT they did recently implement a ""common crate"" key reward for 15 quests completed in a month (easy).  However, if you are worried that you will be missing out on items due to not wanting to buy crates they are mostly filled with cosmetic items with 1 card here and there so they are not required to complete your card collection. The last thing I want to touch on, which is one of my favorites, is the fact that each ""faction"" or class does not only have 1 type of general that has the same hero power no matter the skin or avatar.  There are multiple general (main hero/""face"") options for each faction AND your general always has at least 2 attack and can  move around the board like a chess piece, the same as your minions, instead of just being your avatar with a set power that never moves or defends themself without a weapon equipped.

To get the FULL experience and really find out I suggest you JUST PLAY IT.  Nothing to lose since it is F2P, the system requirements are low, and if you want to get a free spirit orb (or just 100 gold) use my referral code ""gdaddanyt"" and friend me to play some matches!! :) | i like the art work and you can't complain about the gameplay really. sure there are some people with awesome cards or decks, but its all about the strategy. it makes you think and it doesnt get boring. if it does, you can always come back to it later and appreciate the workers who put effort into making this game awesome. | Please support Chinese

然而，问题不仅仅这么简单，这么优秀的游戏却有着一群跟我们思维构造不同的GM和MOD，他们在没有事先通知的情况下封了几乎所有参加过PVP的人，而且时间有的多达30天甚至是365天，经常玩这个游戏热爱这个游戏每天游戏时间足够长的所有国人无一幸免，而且申诉机制异常奇怪，真正该封禁的人被解封了，无辜群众反而被关在了里面，据一些因为玩游戏频率不高而侥幸逃过一劫的国人反应，本来偏小众的游戏的在线人数进一步减少，本来一场联赛平时1分钟以内就一定能排到对手现在却排了四五分钟都无法匹配成功，游玩人数大量减少，玩家纷纷弃坑，然而面对这种结果，GM和MOD却仍然表示满意，绝对自己做得很是正确。另外，由于这个游戏是人治，所以管理上有明显的偏袒，和mod关系好的人不会被封禁然而其余人很容易被封禁，据少数国人反应，游戏内可能有一定反华倾向，在世界打字中文会收获到举报，总之你一定要做好随时被封禁的心理准备即使你只是正常的老老实实的玩游戏。一次封禁很有可能直接抹消掉你之前的时间和金钱投入，所以，即使这个游戏很有趣，但大家入坑前还是要慎重，即使决定了入坑，购买付费内容的时候还是要慎重，毕竟，他们封禁你的时候不会在乎你花了几百几千人民币的。 | Pros:  I was transported back in time 30 years, the flavor and feel of PnP RPG gaming is perfect.  The metagame story is fun and interesting.  Felt like the 1980s...

Cons:  The micropayment cash grab is gross.  You can play free for @30hrs, then you need to start buying access.
Also: this game is a _very cheap_ strat game, with minimalist card building elements.

If you want to feel the nostalgia - play for free.  Any other reason should be a pass.

I give it a thumbs up BARELY and only for the story and feels.  The game is a grind - barely entertaining. | 平时网好的时候用网页版，方便。只有网不好才用客户端，所以看起来游戏时间很少。

[b] Wolfenstein: The New Order [/b] is the first game in MachineGame's Wolfenstein reboot series, and it's really fucking good.

[h2] Gameplay [/h2]
The best way to describe this game is Call of Duty if it was a bit less reliant on cover (I will likely be flamed for saying that sentence). As William B.J. Blazkowicz, you use a variety of guns, most of which being able to be dual wielded, with your arsenal resetting between almost every level, to defeat enemies. Similar to DOOM you have both health and armour, but your health regenerates in blocks of twenty, enticing you to not just blindly rush into the field. As you kill enemies in specific ways you gain perks, which make you better in some ways.

Across levels you can also find many collectibles, including weapon upgrades (usually alternate fire modes), health/armour upgrades, gold artefacts and letters. The game encourages replayability, with a thing I'll mention in the story section.

[h2] Story [/h2]

The Allies have lost World War II, and the Nazis have won due to some crazy technology, resulting in them enacting complete world domination. You get involved in a resistance over a decade after the war to defeat their regime. 

Towards the start of the game you make a choice, affecting both the narrative as well as some gameplay mechanics and upgrades. It's not massively different and the core story plays out practically the same no matter the outcome, but it's a cool mechanic, and implores you to play the game multiple times.

[h2] Graphics [/h2]

Being a 2014 game that's not Crysis it's not particularly a looker, but the devs had a keen eye for art direction, as despite the technological shortcomings it does a solid job at immersing you into the world. It's not the most immersive game ever made, but the devs did well with the tech of the time. Runs pretty great too, save for screenshotting via Steam, which causes the game to freeze as well and temporarily get rid of some screen effects, such as when the game cuts to black.

[h2] Verdict [/h2]

Overall, I hereby declare [b] Wolfenstein: The New Order [/b] as 

[h3] REALLY FUCKING GOOD [/h3]

While the game is pretty cheap by itself, the game goes much cheaper during a sale, but honestly you can't go wrong buying it at full price","A great game, with a great story and a great storyline."

Sure, it doesn’t include the expansions, and I wish it did, but even the base game has so much to offer. Whether you’re revisiting it like me or trying it for the first time, there’s a reason this game is a legend in the strategy genre.

Якщо у цивці у фракцій є невеличкі відмінності які виражені парою юнітів і перками, то тут у однієї можна переміщати цілі міста, інша тераформує місцевість під себе, а дехто взагалі нормально почуває себе тільки у воді.

There's really nothing special about the two main parts of the game being combat and the story.

Only time where I really enjoyed playing is one section with multiple extended combat encounters where I had to plan out a strategy and ration my consumable items. Not sure if it was scripted or a random chance on doing a mission but I ended up getting a surprise combat after I believed everything was finished.

The hacking ""decking"" mechanic is a complete waste of time and consists of even worse combat just to use cameras for vision where it doesn't matter or turrets in areas where no enemies go. It also uses turns in combat so you're missing a fourth party member just to do it.
The Shaman class is one that I want to like but can't because of your summons have a chance to escape and turn on you every turn with increasing chances. I love the idea of support classes in general, but even its haste buff feels underwhelming. The range on the starting Shaman NPC's damage reduction aoe is also so short that there's no point in using it. 

The story isn't great either. A good majority of your supporting characters either do not like you or do not trust you which leads you to pry scraps and pieces of information from them over time. You're also mostly doing a bunch of disjointed side missions ranging from mildly interesting to a waste of time that makes you dislike your party members even more because they disapproved of you doing the morally right thing or doing anything risky. All of this is sometimes broken up by story exposition that goes on for too long and does not result in anything except your team's information broker saying that he'll look into it. | A good CRPG for its modest budget. Liked the companions and the main story while taking some predictable turns remained enjoyable for the most part, seems like there is a decent variety of outcomes, will probably replay it with couple more builds to see how things play out with different choices and I want to see what passing some skillchecks does, unlike modern CRPGs you can't use party members to pass them, gotta do most of them yourself. There is definitely an intent for you to play some specific builds like INT with high biotech skill. Can't say for sure that all build options are equally interesting and rewarding but a rather simpleminded ""All points in Quickness"" basic gunslinger with just enough Charisma to get two etiquettes: corporate and shadowrunner, still was satisfying on the first playthrough. Just don't take Socialite, seen like one etiquette check involving it through the whole game and it was just for a bit extra money, stick to something like Security or Academic instead.

On an additional note, I couldn't help finding the epilogue of the main story a bit underwhelming. You make the final choice, go back to your home, talk about it with your crew and then get a bit of extra context on what transpired and what's gonna happen from couple very important (in a setting, not narrative, that is) NPCs before getting a text epilogue that tells about the several events in the future, some of them probably an outcome of your decisions throughout the game. And that's it. I guess the underwhelming part is a natural outcome of the narrative framing, you get dragged into this deadly grand mystery and resolving it is the only way to survive but you don't really have any other motivation, at best to avenge an NPC who dies in the prologue and another NPC who dies in the middle of the game. So while your involvement is narratively justified, the personal stakes you and your companions have don't feel interesting?  No matter how well you furnish it with dialogues ""Phew, that was quite something. Glad we survived. What do we do now?"" is still something lacking oomph, at least for me. | DragonFall Nails it.

From the tone of the world, to the depth and nuance of the characters you encounter the writing in this game walks the line of ""in world"" conversations while not verging into the valley of cringe that is easy to slip into.

I slept on the SR series for years, picked this up mostly for research, and found a lot of unexpectedly interesting design and narrative decisions. It's hard to pick one thing that SR:DF does unusually well, but the ambience, systems, narrative, writing, art never fall below 'very good' and they work together harmoniously. And of course it's really faithful to the original IP if you were there for that in the early TRPG days, so if you're here for nostalgia, fill yer boots.

All in all, this game is clearly a love letter to the games showcased within, but I feel the developer just didn't have the experience to make a good game out of the idea. | I have buyers remorse and I don't have buyers remorse at the same time. Would I recommend people play this game? Not really. It's just a game without substance. The platforming is very generic and the whole big gimmick of the game has been done before it's just this time you have characters from other indie titles to help you out, sometimes not even with their gimmicks from their own games. The main character you play as looks incredibly dull and boring compared to the cast of other indie titles. Most of the stages feel as if they came from a teenager making their first Steam Workshop levels. This game is a shocking missed opportunity to really make a well made product considering its potential. Currently as it is though, it's just bait. I'm not saying the game is down right horrible, it's just a game with nothing interesting or ""cool"" about it. Now while the game is an incredibly dull and mediocre experience so far, I will complete the game and possibly change my opinion.

 Oh right i'd also like to state, the music is terrible. Now while I do make music I am by no means that great of an artist. But this music is competing up there with Sonic Chronicles and Yoshi's New Island. Music is a core part of an enjoyable experience for me and i'm not a fan of what seems like 15 second loops. Generic Dream Pop schlock artists have made longer length in repeating notes than that.

Главным героем выступает кот, который случайно попал в мир игры, которого, собственно, нужно оттуда вытащить. 
По ходу прохождения нам будут попадаться герои из других игр вроде Braid, BIT TRIP RUNNER. Они будут помогать нам проходить уровни.. К примеру, один герой может делать платформы, по которым можно прыгать, а другой умеет пригибаться под препятствиями. 
После того, как мы отыграем за героя из другой игры, нас возвращают в шкуру кота и вот, мы уже бежим с нашим приятелем за которого играли ранее, он выполняет те же действия, что и вы, когда играли за него. 
Так же, интересно сделана смерть нашего героя, её нету.. Время просто отматывается назад до чекпоинта (почти как в Braid). Так же, время можно отмотать и не умирая. К примеру, если вы сделали что то не так (поставили не там платформу, не собрали кристалы и т.д.), то можете всё исправить. 
Игра сделана как платформер. Граффика в игре приятная, герои хорошо прорисованны, задние планы и локации меняются и не надоедают. Музыка тоже приятная, хоть я и выключил её после 15 минут игры и включил свою.. :)
Играть, конечно же, лучше на геймпаде !это же платформер! Хотя, на клавиатуре я играть не пробывал. 

Моя оценка игре 10/10. 
  

Надеюсь, мой обзор был для вас полезен. | I enjoyed this game at the beginning.  I got to be a kitty and the early stages were fun.  However, as the game dragged on, the shortfalls grew too big to ignore.

While the idea is interesting, the execution is terrible.  Playing out each part for each hero means that you have to go through many stages multiple times and there is a lot of forced waiting for your previous play-throughs to sync with you, especially after you die.  There is a fast-forward button, but it's not enough.  The game would be a lot more fun if you didn't die from every hit; some of the windows for you to move are extremely tight, especially in the later levels where the new heroes begin to feature progressively worse control.  These issues combined really wear down on patience, even without the game's buggy nature.

Now, when I say ""buggy,"" I mean VERY buggy, Sonic '06 buggy.  For starters, it is way too easy to clip inside platforms and get stuck, especially in the later stages.  I didn't notice any long load times, but while I was playing through, the glitches got worse.  Previous playthroughs would break synch; some enemies I killed in previous runs didn't die half the time.  In addition, the game froze on me multiple times with most of the instances being when the game rewound my progress after I died.  My PC isn't top-of-the-line, but it's more than capable of running this type of game.  However, even my whole PC crashed because of this game.  I had to do a hard reset to get everything back up.  

The developer obviously skimped on playtesting and quality control.  Avoid this one. | 나름 인지도가 높은 인디 게임 주인공들의 제 1차 드림팀.
그러나 그 드팀팀은 가벼운 동네 운동회 이상의 규모는 되지 못했다.

플래포머 게임으로써의 재미는 나쁘지 않은 편이다. 각 캐릭터의 특성이 다양하고 서로의 특성을 적극 활용하는 스테이지들이 준비가 잘 되어있어 게임 자체는 재미있게 즐길 수 있다. 거기에 각 캐릭터 고유의 메달들도 수집요소로써 준비되어 있어 이거 모으는 재미도 쏠쏠한 편. 이 메달들은 무려 스팀 도전과제와 연동이 된다. 따라서 스팀 도전과제 효율이 좋다는 장점도 같이 가져가게 된다.

각 캐릭터를 특정 타이밍 혹은 특정 순서대로 움직이고, 이전에 움직인 캐릭터와 나중에 움직일 캐릭터가 서로 연계하여 움직이며, 스테이지 내 장치들을 작동시켜 나가고 출구에 도달하는 방식으로 게임이 진행된다. Team Indie라는 게임의 설정에 부합하는 모습을 보여주고, 덕분에 게임이 꽤나 유기적으로 흘러간다. 다만 이러다보니 나중에 움직일 캐릭터를 대비해 우선 움직이는 캐릭터를 미리 움직여 주는 것이 꽤 중요하다. 중반부만 가도 이 계산이 꼬일 때가 많다. 

판정이 그다지 직관적이지는 못한데, 자신이 생각한 것 보다 약간 다르게 움직여 죽게 되는 상황이 꽤나 생긴다. 거기다 이전에 움직였던 캐릭터의 움직임이 제대로 반영이 안 되거나 좁은 곳에 낑기기도 하는 등의 버그도 가끔 발생하곤 하니 조금 골치가 아프다.

하지만 이런 점보다 내가 이 게임에 가장 실망한 부분은 그저 다른 인디 게임 주인공을 모아둔 게임, 그 이상을 보여주지 못했다는 것. 단순히 다른 인디 게임의 주인공만 모였을 뿐, 서로 다른 주인공들간의 상호작용 같은 것이 전무하다는 것이다. 그저 각 캐릭터들의 특성(그나마도 특수능력 한두개 정도만 구현된 수준이다.)을 통해 스테이지를 클리어해 나가기만 하며, 그들간의 소소한 대화나 다툼 같은 상호작용이 전혀 없다. 적어도 슈퍼로봇대전이나 킹 오브 파이터즈 같은 그림을 바랬었는데, 현실은 그냥 이런 저런 인디 게임 캐릭터들 모아놓은 갤러리 정도밖에 되지 못했다.

인디 게임의 주인공들 중에선 꽤나 유명한 녀석들이 많이 등장하니 Team Indie에 등장하는 녀석들 중 네다섯 이상을 알고있다! 하는 사람들이라면 한 번 쯤 즐겨볼 만 하다. (본인은 딱 한 놈 빼고 다 알고 있었고) 반대로, 여기 등장하는 녀석들 중 모르는 놈들이 많다 하는 분들에게는 딱히 추천하고 싶진 않다.","The game mixing idea is clever, but the characters from other games feel awful to control compared to their source games.

This game is the perfect blend of Minesweeper's simplicity and a logic puzzle's complexity, creating a loop of ""just one more puzzle"" that somehow turns into hours. The infinite mode is a bottomless pit of challenges, each one a deliciously rewarding mini-victory for my brain. The difficulty is just right – it keeps me on my toes without making me want to throw my mouse out the window. And the fact that I can jump in and out with puzzles that fit into any spare moment is无比 convenient. Hexcells Infinite is like a good book; once you start, it's hard to put down. If you're looking for a game that's as satisfying as it is challenging, look no further. This one's a keeper!",

Unturned, Nelson Sexton tarafından geliştirilen ve 2014 yılında erken erişime açılan ücretsiz bir hayatta kalma oyunudur. Oyun, blok tarzı grafiklerle sunulan bir dünyada geçer ve oyuncuların hayatta kalmak için kaynak toplaması, barınak inşa etmesi ve zombilerle savaşması gerekmektedir.

Oynanış:
Unturned, oyunculara geniş bir dünya sunar. Kaynak toplama, yiyecek bulma ve silah yapma gibi temel hayatta kalma unsurlarıyla doludur. Zombilerle dolu bu dünyada, hayatta kalmak için stratejik düşünmek önemlidir. Ayrıca, oyuncular arasında işbirliği yapma veya rekabet etme seçeneği de vardır.

Kendi Yorumum:
Oynanış dinamikleri oldukça eğlenceli ve bağımlılık yapıcı. Özellikle arkadaşlarla birlikte oynandığında, keşif ve hayatta kalma unsurları çok daha keyifli hale geliyor. Ancak, bazen oyunun basit grafikleri ve mekanikleri bazı oyuncular için çekiciliğini azaltabilir.

Grafikler ve Ses:
Unturned, blok tarzı grafiklerle sunulmasına rağmen, bu tasarımın kendine özgü bir cazibesi var. Ses efektleri, oyunun atmosferini destekliyor, ancak bazen daha fazla çeşitlilik bekleyebilirsiniz.

Kendi Yorumum:
Grafikler basit olsa da, bu durum oyunun eğlencesini etkilemiyor. Hatta bazı oyuncular bu tarzı sevebilir. Ancak, daha gerçekçi bir deneyim arayanlar için hayal kırıklığı yaratabilir.

Topluluk ve Mod Desteği:
Unturned, aktif bir topluluğa ve geniş bir mod desteğine sahiptir. Oyuncular, çeşitli modlar ve sunucular aracılığıyla oyunu özelleştirebilir. Bu, oyunun ömrünü uzatır ve farklı deneyimler sunar.

Kendi Yorumum:
Topluluk, oldukça destekleyici ve yenilikçi. Modlar, oyunun eğlencesini artırıyor ve sürekli yeni içerikler sunuyor. Ancak, bazı sunuculardaki toksik davranışlar can sıkıcı olabilir.

Sonuç:
Unturned, hayatta kalma oyunları arasında kendine özgü bir yer edinmiştir. Basit ama eğlenceli yapısıyla, oyunculara hem zorlu hem de keyifli bir deneyim sunar. Eğer arkadaşlarınızla birlikte eğlenceli bir hayatta kalma oyunu arıyorsanız, Unturned kesinlikle denemeye değer.

Кожен твій вибір - це помилка, кожен крок - це шанс втратити останній шматок здорового глузду. | This was my first CRPG and I would argue it was a great place to start (especially if you are like me and can't run Baldur's Gate III). I went into this primarily as a fan of Fallout: New Vegas and that's kind of how I'm framing this review (no major spoilers though). I had come to understand that despite being in an entirely different genre, the rich and believable world of Fallout: New Vegas, along with its willingness to present tough choices with real consequences, could be traced back to the original game in the series. I wanted more of that universe and its choices, and Fallout 1 more than delivered.

That being said, the game asks a lot of you. It requires far more patience than just about any modern game I've played, and even then the reward for this patience is less tangible than, say, defeating a boss in a soulslike. This game asks you to do a lot of reading, with the reward ultimately kind of being... more reading. However mundane that sounds, the dialogue here is among the best rewards in any game I can think of. The writing is subtler than New Vegas, the comedy a little more sparse (yet equally funny), and the tone more focused... and what a tone it is. This game is *bleak*. It hasn't yet been 100 years since the bombs fell, and it shows. Civilization is only just beginning to rebuild. Fallout 1's characters take this world very seriously, because it appears they have no other choice.

Having given all that praise, on a first playthrough, I did feel like I was waving a cane in the dark. Stats are everything, so build a character poorly and you could be SOL, especially given the time limit on the main quest (the timer is actually quite forgiving, but it definitely didn't feel that way without knowing how far along the quest I was). Dialogue choices with major consequences are often not presented that way, and combat encounters come out of absolute nowhere at times. I learned to save frequently which mostly circumvented these problems, but there was definitely a good deal of frustration, especially at first. I also had to use a guide a few times, with some clues for progression being just a little too cryptic in my opinion (oldheads may disagree).

Ultimately, all of the resistance that came along with this game only made it that much more rewarding to complete. The feeling of finally taking out a Deathclaw, or repairing a robot using context clues alone and watching it clear a path forward, or realizing that the once-unintuitive controls had become second nature, or random-encountering a crashed alien spaceship, or losing a companion and choosing to let the story go on without them. Each of these moments meant a lot, and there were countless others like them.

This is definitely not a game to come home to during a stressful week at work, but it *is* a game to fall in love with on a long weekend. I highly recommend. | Despite its age and dated graphics, Fallout 1 remains an outstanding experience that truly embodies the post-apocalyptic genre. The game’s gripping narrative, immersive setting, and brutal atmosphere all combine to create a world that feels genuinely hostile and unforgiving.

One of Fallout 1’s greatest strengths is its complexity. There are no convenient quest markers here—if you want to succeed, you’ll have to pay attention, explore, and put in the effort. In the early stages, you’ll feel weak and vulnerable, yet good tactics and resourcefulness can carry you further than you’d expect. When you finally grow strong, that sense of power is palpable, but the game never stops being dangerous; even a high-level character can still meet a swift demise if you’re careless.

Overall, Fallout 1 delivers a challenging, deeply rewarding experience that stands the test of time. It’s a must-play for anyone looking to truly immerse themselves in a stark, post-nuclear world. Fallout New Vegas is called the best Fallout game even, but this one set the tone and started it all! | Не идеальная, но прекрасная игра. В начале может показаться, что слишком много свободы, боишься, что запутаешься, не сможешь понять, куда идти дальше, но поговорив с нпс всё становится понятно.

[b]Пройти гру як абсолютний ідіот - це окреме мистецтво. Якщо зробити персонажа з мінімальним інтелектом, діалоги перетворюються на безглузде бурмотіння. NPC сміються, вороги б’ють, а я просто живу своїм звичним життям.[/b]

Гра - справжній витвір мистецтва з чудовою атмосферою постапокаліпсису. Брудний, занедбаний світ, де ніхто не дбає про мораль, але всі дбають про виживання. Діалоги похмурі, цинічні та наповнені чорним гумором, що чудово передає відчайдушну атмосферу світу після війни. Музика - шедевр, а голоси персонажів дивом не викликають бажання вимкнути звук.
Звісно, є і мінуси. Графіка стара, і гра не адаптована під сучасні роздільні здатності, тому іноді важко зрозуміти, чи ти дивишся на купу пікселів, чи на чергового ворога. Гра не прощає помилок: неправильний вибір навичок - і ти офіційно перестворюєш збередення. 

Також зауважте, що Steam версія цензурована - без дітей і тд, що позбавляє багатьох можливостей для... соціального експерименту :) | É engraçado como esse jogo é enorme em playtime (vai de 45h~50h pra finalizar a main quest e fazer outras sidequests) e ainda assim parece uma expansão do Fallout 1. Ele melhora muitas coisas, mas a história é inferior a do primeiro, mas como complemento (e de novo, pensando como se fosse uma DLC) funciona bem demais. É um jogo frustrante (no bom sentido) que força e incita vários playthroughs, assim como o primeiro também possui essa qualidade. Sinto que o Fallout 1 é melhor pelo fator inovação e por apresentar um mundo tão ou mais complexo que o desse jogo, mesmo com uma duração e mundo bem menores. Se o Fallout 2 tem uma boa história, é porque ele se alicerça muito em quase todas as fundações que o primeiro construiu. E se for pra colocar algum defeito, é que o budget desse jogo foi claramente muito pequeno. Tem vários cenários repetidos ao longo do jogo, assim como cenários idênticos aos do primeiro jogo. Pra se ter uma ideia, no final do Fallout 1 você tinha artes conceituais que contavam o futuro de cada terreno do jogo. Neste, eles mal conseguiram fazer essas artes pra todos os territórios, em vários, eles só tinham umas fotos que vagamente remetiam ao cenário originário.

Enfim, eu recomendo bastante, mas acho que ele te pegará e prenderá muito mais se você jogar o primeiro antes. O combate pode ser chato e até meio complicado no começo, mas depois, quando você entende como ele funciona, vira uma das coisas mais divertidas desses jogos. | Me da mucho miedo el mosco ese de la portada, me regaña porque no traigo servoarmadura, que bueno que me lo chingué | My character:

Ou jeu bidon. | Fallout Tactics takes the beloved Fallout universe and shifts it into squad-based, tactical combat—think XCOM meets the wasteland. Unlike the main RPG entries, this game focuses on strategic battles, giving you full control over a squad of Brotherhood of Steel soldiers as they fight raiders, mutants, and all the horrors of post-apocalyptic America.

The combat is deep and rewarding, offering both turn-based and real-time modes to suit different playstyles. Customizing your squad, managing resources, and adapting to brutal encounters keeps things engaging. While it lacks the open-world freedom of mainline Fallout games, its tight mission structure and tactical depth make it a unique and underrated gem in the series.

It may not be everyone’s cup of Nuka-Cola, but for strategy fans who love Fallout’s setting, Tactics delivers a challenging and satisfying experience—just don’t expect deep dialogue or karma decisions. | Se você já conhece a franquia, vou direto para a parte que talvez possa lhe interessar:

Fallout Tactics é muito dinâmico, os combates não são por turno (a menos que você use VATS, claro) e você precisa montar estratégias de combate para vencer os inimigos.
Você monta seu esquadrão (até 6 pessoas) e vai upando as habilidades deles.
Basicamente você e seu esquadrão são integrantes da Brotherhood e seu superior fica te enviando para algum lugar para cumprir uma missão de resgatar uma pessoa, buscar tecnologia, etc.
Portanto, não é mundo aberto nem 100% RPG. Também não espere uma história com um enredo mega desenvolvido.

The gameplay consists of using a grappling hook (really just a red line) to swing around in arcing trajectories in order to collide with some red bars. The levels consist of some randomly-placed grey boxes to which are attached red bars. The more bars you collide with (while avoiding collisions with the grey boxes), the higher your score. That's. . . basically the whole game. Pressing ""enter"" allows you to skip to the next level, but as far as I can tell all of the levels are pretty much exactly the same. Just randomly-placed boxes. There doesn't seem to be a clear objective to the game either, aside from simply getting a high score. There is no endgame as far as I can tell.

Honestly, this looks like a simple proof-of-concept prototype that could have been made in Unity in an afternoon. There's hardly any content and the gameplay gets boring after a few minutes. A point in the game's favour is that it's free, so I can't really complain about the price. If you're curious, you might as well download it and try it out for yourself. But I wouldn't personally recommend it.

You should check out the developer's other game, [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/206190/]Gunpoint[/url]. It's a much better game in my opinion. | I personally think this is THE MOST relaxing game on steam right now, there are custimization settings and everything is your pace chill and a great time waster usually runs on all computers most no system reqs and a steady 50 fps on all pcs usually | Este jogo até tem uma boa jogabilidade , uma que funcione , porem ele é muito ... incompleto , melhoraria se tivese mais cenarios , mais itens para pegar , seria legal um esquema de personalização do nosso ponto , uma melhora grafica para não ficar intediante não seria ruim .",shit game I've ever played.
76561197970698176,310380,Unknown,0.05,,0,"Fractured Space ist ein Teambasiertes Moba Spiel welches man vom Grundprinzip her mit LoL,Dota etc. vergleichen kann.
Ich werde nur die positiven und negativen Aspekte aufzählen,wer Infos zum Gameplay haben möchte kann sich die Beschreibung sowie Youtube Videos anschauen.

Pro:
+Open Development
(Die Entwickler befassen sich sehr stark mit den Mitspielern und zeigen ihren Entwicklungsplan offen auf dieser Website https://trello.com/b/pOsdj00F/fractured-space.Dort können Spieler ebenfalls Ideen einbringen und abstimmen welches Feature als nächtes entwickelt werden soll bzw. verbessert.Desweiteren kommen regelmäßig Entwickler auf die Gameserver wo man diese direkt ansprechen kann und aauch immer ein Feedback bekommt.Zusätzlich gibt es einen TS3 Server auf dem des öfteren ein ""Community Day"" abgehalten wird und man sich mit den Entwicklern sogar unterhalten kann,gesprochen wird natürlich nur in English.

+Hübsche Grafik
(Die Unreal Engine 4 bringt in diesem Spiel eine gute Leistung.Licht/Schatten,Effekte sowie Texturen sehen Größtenteils sauber und naja spacig aus^^.)

+Große Auswahl an Schiffen
(Es gibt trotz Early Acess eine Ganze Armada an verschiedenen Schiffen welche sich meistens komplett unterschiedlich spielen und einsetzen lassen.)

+Free to play Model
(Nach der Alpha wird dieses Spiel Free to play und wenn ich dass richtig beurteilen kann dann kein Pay2Win.Man kann sich im moment nur Tarnungen bzw. Skins für seine Schiffe von echten Geld kaufen,den Rest muss man sich erspielen.
Es gibt zwar Premiumschiffe nur sind diese identisch mit ihren normalen Ebenbildern und haben keine erhöten Stats,sondern geben lediglich mehr exp/credits am ende einer Runde)

+Einfache,saubere Steuerung
(Die Steuerung des Schiffes ist ziehmlich simpel gehalten trotzdem können erfahrenere Spieler anspruchsvollere Manöver ausführen als Anfänger.Also kann man sich im Spielstil weiterentwickeln was einen imensen Vorteil in manchen Situationen bringen kann.)

+Startegie Faktor
(Durch die meist langsame Bewegung der Schiffe kann man nicht immer überall sein,so muss man sich überlegen wo man als nächstes hinspringt.Man muss sich oft überlegen ob man im Sektor A bleibt oder doch lieber zu B springt um da weiter zu kommen bzw. zu verteidigen.Es gibt noch viele weitere Faktoren die ich hier nicht aufzählen möchte trd. hat dieses Spiel eine strategische Tiefe die man nicht unbeachtet lassen darf.)

Kontra:

- Bugs,teilweise unbalanciert,Crashes
(Dieses Kontra enpfinde ich als eher nichtig,da dass Spiel sich in einer Alpha befindet und somit Fehler haben darf.
Dennoch gibt es oft Mapbugs,das Spiel crashed durch Ladefehler,am Anfang einer Runde hängt sich der Server auf wodurch man warten oder das Spiel neu starten muss,manche Schiffe können mit anderen kaum bzw. garnicht mithalten usw.
Ich gehe aber davon aus,da ich oft mit entwicklern gesprochen habe,dass diese Kindheitsfehler noch behoben werden.)

-schlechte Performance/schlechte Server
(Auf meinem PC läuft dass Spiel am Anfang einer Runde sauber mit 70-80 fps allerdings verschlechtern sich diese drastisch auf bis zu 20-30 fps wenn es zu einem großen Kampf kommt.Mein PC setup steht in meiner Profilbeschreibung,ich selbst klassifiziere es als mid-high system.Wenn die Entwickler wirklich ein Free2Play Model wollen sollten sie an diesem Punkt ordentlich schrauben,sonst werden die meisten Spieler von diesem Spiel ablassen nur wegen der Performance.
Außerdem verursacht die hohe Latenz von durchschnittlich 100 eine ziehmlich bemerkbare verzögerung in der Steuerung.)


Ich persönlich vertraue auf die Entwickler da diese schon oft gezeigt haben dass sie können und wollen.
Die nahe Zusammenarbeit mit der Community und die Regelmäßigen Updates machen dieses Spiel immer besser und immer mehr Gamer tummeln sich auf den Servern.
Das größte Kontra ist die relativ schelchte Performance und der stetig hohe Ping,was das Gameplay teilweise komplett zerstört.Es wär schade wenn so ein Spiel gemieden wird,nur weil es schlechte Server und eine madige Perfomance besitzt.

Meinerseits eine Kaufempfehlung an Spieler die Sci-Fi mögen und an Competetive Moba Gamer.

Ps. über Feedback zum Review freue ich mich immer :)

 | Интересная неторопливая поначалу игра в космические кораблики плавно перетекла в активный тактический шутер с прокачкой корабля. Кораблей не очень много и на сегодня они напоминают TF2 персонажей: тяжелый и неторопливый танкующий крепыш, снайпер, шпион-подсиратель, середнячок для масс и т.д... Ну разве что для авианосца нет особого аналога. И шляп нет. Зато можно менять орудия, причем принцип действия каждого может отличаться кардинально (Например, ракеты или торпеды летят с разной скоростью и скорость наведения тоже разная, у каких-то торпед вообще наведение почти нулевое).
_
Для альфы очень неплохой задел, т.к. способности кораблей далеко не всегда помогают и решает правильное позиционирование себя на поле боя, и в соло бой вряд ли вытащишь, как бы хорошо ты не управлял кораблем, как бы не использовал астероиды для укрытия, как бы не уходил в инвиз или использовал преимущество в скорости. Игра нетороплива, но в итоге четкий просчет скоростей и состава кораблей противника позволяют творить невероятные гамбиты и вождения за нос. 
_
Для альфы стандартный набор минусов: на 28 января малый онлайн (в основном пользователи Нового Света), Ошибки матчмейкинга и частые зависания при входе в матч, в моем случае пришлось дополнительно настроить ярлык на запуск с дискретной видеокартой, как и со всеми альфами, бетами и иногда даже готовыми релизами.
_
П.С. Звуки и окружающий звук неплохо погружают в атмосферу. Пиу-пиу! Дакка-дакка! Ка-бууум! Пдыщь! Бам! | このゲームは、数千人が乗り込む巨大戦艦を操り5VS5で相手陣営の本拠点占領を目標に戦うものです。将来的にFreeToPlayになりますが、現時点で購入しておいて損にはなりません。何故ならば出資者ボーナスが付与されるだけでなく、宇宙が好き、SFが好きという方にとって満足いくものだからです。

　ゲーム内には様々な艦船がすでに実装されており、ステルス航行が可能なものや、そのステルス航行している艦船をブイを設置し探知するもの、短距離ワープを繰り返しながら戦うもの、高いHPをもった対空砲（範囲攻撃）を連射して戦うもの、長距離狙撃と味方の火力アップを担うもの、味方のHP回復や相手の武器やスキルを一時的に無効化するものなどがあります。

　それぞれの船ごとに得意な戦い方があり、苦手な相手がいます。従って○○を選べば最強というものではありません。しかしながら事前にチームを組んで戦うものではないため、その場で出会った人とチームを組んで戦う事が多く、結果的に誰もが対処できない艦船が相手に居るため負けることもあります。

　最後に。SF好きな人にとって、初期に乗れる艦船ですら、「あ、ここに飛行甲板がある！」「これは砲台だな？」と見ているだけでも結構うれしいのでは？

Fractured space is a 5 vs. 5 team battle on areas of space that has been divided in various sectors. All sectors have control points you need to capture in order to advance and eventually make your way to enemy base. During combat you can freely fly in the battlefield, warp into sectors where the combat is currently going on and warp back to base to regroup or to run away with your nearly destroyed ship for repairs. 

There's currently 15 different ship types in game, 3 of them unlocked right at the start. Ship types fit for many roles: long range, hard hitting sniper boat, heavily armored flagship for more close range combat, sneaky & stealthy assassin ship, fast moving frigate etc. As the game is currently in it's early stages, it understandably might have some balance issues between various ship designs - though I personally feel like every ship has their own use and an organized group will easily take down those solo snipers or assassins who think they can/should be able to kill everything themselves. 

PROs: 
Awesome ship design 
Well made level 
Graphics, sfx 

CONs 
1(one) level 
Very low playerbase (seen max of 54) 
Level Matching system(isn't one) 
No real training/tutorials 

For an EARLY ACCESS game, its good, Its not super great, but its really entertaining. Graphics are great, has a solid gameplay. People here are giving it negative reviews because they want a finished product but its no where near that stage yet. The game is great at its current stage and it can only get better from here. I'd definitely recommend this game for anyone who loves space sci-fi. | This game is a lot of fun. It's easy to play but there are a lot of intricacies for certain parts that if you learn will really help you. There isn't any sort of ""pay to win"" aspect of this game. All of the crew packs can be obtained through premium currency (Platinum) or standard currency that you earn in game (Credits). Other purchases are merely cosmetic, they are reskins of the ships. Different paint jobs and the like. Ships can be purchased with Platinum or Credits. 
The game is fair, and a lot of fun. The AI is actually really good in my opinion and at times can be rather challenging. 
I highly recommend this game, and I hope the developers keep working on it, adding more ships and *maps* and different crews.",- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Normalde parti tabanlı rpglerden pek haz etmezdim ama bu çok zevkliydi. 

Oynanış sıra tabanlı, klasik olarak bir saldırı yapacağınızda size bir % oranı veriyor ve bu orana göre vurup vurmama ihtimaliniz belirleniyor. Tabii ki karakterlerin yeteneklerine ve kullandıkları silahlara göre bu oran değişiklik gösteriyor bu yüzden bunlara göre ayarlayıp oynamalısınız. Bunun haricinde bomba, füze gibi şeyler kullanabiliyorsunuz. Ama tabii ki bunların vurma oranı yok bu yüzden kullandığınızda kesinlikle hasar veriyorlar. Karakterlerin her birinin yeteneklerine göre değişiklik gösteren enerjileri var. Bu yüzden her sıra size döndüğünde tek vuruş yapmaya yetecek kadar enerjiniz olacak. Onun için sizin dövüşü kazanmanıza en çok yardımcı olacak rakibe saldırmanız gerekli. Ayrıca tavsiyem ağır silahlar kullanmayın, çünkü vurma ihtimalleri diğer silahlara göre daha düşük ve daha fazla mermi harcıyorlar. Çorak topraklarda bulabildiğiniz her mermi değerli olacak ve en iyi şekilde değerlendirmeniz gerekecek. Kendi adıma en çok sinirlendiğim kısım vurma oranı %80 gibi yüksek oranları gösterse de çoğu zaman saldırıları ıskalamak oldu. Büyük ihtimalle siz de oynadığınızda aynısını yaşayacaksınız hazırlıklı olmanızı öneririm. 

Karakter yükseltmelerine gelelim. Oyunda bir sürü farklı sınıf bulunuyor, istediğiniz karakteri istediğiniz sınıflara göre yükseltebiliyorsunuz. Hepsini sayamıyorum çünkü gerçekten fazla şey var. Kilit Açma, Mekanik Ustası ve Sezgi gibi beceriler işinize yarayacaktır, bunun haricinde takımınız 7 kişi olacak. Her birini farklı bir silah konusunda ustalaştırmanızı öneririm. Bu sayede aynı mermiyi kullanmak zorunda kalmayacaksınız ve daha efektif dövüşler yapabileceksiniz. Ama karakterlerinize Hayvan Dili gibi hiçbir işe yaramayacak yetenekler vermemeye çalışın çünkü işe yaramayacaklar. 

Her RPG oyununda olduğu gibi bu oyunda da seçimler ile oyunun sonunu veya olayların gidişatını değiştiriyorsunuz. Bu yüzden ona göre hareket edebilirsiniz. Ve bazı görevlerde ne yaparsanız yapın iyi sona ulaşmak mümkün olmayabilir, işin güzelliği de burda. Hikayeye gelirsek oyunda Çöl Muhafızları denilen bir askeri birliğin üyesiyiz ve onlar için çalışıyoruz. Verdikleri görevleri yerine getiriyoruz ve ya getirmiyoruz, size kalmış. Oyunun birden fazla sonu var ve emin olun hepsi sizi tatmin edecektir. 

Son olarak oyunun incelemelerine baktığımda olumsuz yazıların hepsinin Türkçe dil ile ilgili olduğunu gördüm. Aslında komik çünkü Steam'de Türkçe dil desteği var yazmasına rağmen oyun içinde olmadığını söylemişler. Bu kısmen yanlış çünkü oyunu satın aldığınızda size 2 tane oyun veriyor biri ''Wasteland 2'' diğeri ise ''Wasteland 2: Director's Cut'' evet Wasteland 2 olan versiyonda Türkçe yok ama diğer Director's Cut sürümünü indirirseniz Türkçe dil onun içinde. İki oyun arasındaki fark ne diye sorarsanız herhangi bir fark olduğunu düşünmüyorum, ikisi de hemen hemen aynı oyun. O yüzden olumsuz vermeden önce insanlar biraz araştırmalı ve yargısız infaz yapmamalı. 

Her neyse oyun kesinlikle pişman etmeyecek türden bir RPG. İndirimde 3,74 dolara kadar düşüyor. Bu fiyata bu oyun bedava sayılır. 40 saatlik bir oyun süresini garanti edebilirim. Ayrıca incelemede 4 saat gözüktüğüne bakmayın, o saat Wasteland 2 oyunundaki saatimi gösteriyor yani içinde Türkçe dil olmayan sürümü. Director's Cut sürümünde 80 saatim var. | I have played this for 28 hours and decided not to continue. It's just too sloggish. I have completed Wasteland 3, and was told Wasteland 2 has better stories and decision. That may be true, but the quality of life os Wasteland 2 is too poor in comparison to Wasteland 3.

As the spiritual successor to the original Wasteland (and granddaddy of Fallout), it delivers deep turn-based combat, tough moral choices, and a world that reacts to your every decision—sometimes in hilariously brutal ways.

The game’s writing is sharp, filled with dark humor, strange factions, and quests that rarely have a clear “right” answer. Squad customization is top-notch, letting you build a team of Desert Rangers suited for diplomacy, hacking, or just good old-fashioned shootouts. Every bullet counts, every decision matters, and the wasteland never plays fair.

Sure, it’s tough, a little clunky at times, and doesn’t hold your hand—but for fans of classic CRPGs, Wasteland 2 is a must-play. Just remember: save often, and never underestimate a guy with a sawed-off shotgun. | Liked the gameplay and the combat very much

游戏的系统机制和其他类似游戏很不一样，手册也有很多没说清楚的地方，个人摸索理解了一下：
本作比起战斗“竞速”更像纯撞车德比游戏，通过破坏行为获得积分并延后时间限制。胜利失败(加不加名次)由结算时获得的积分进行判定，一般通过摧毁所有对手进行结算。
完成竞速是结算的一种办法，人机对手永远不会在竞速中获胜。
人机只会在玩家处于附近的时候处于实际运行状态，会撞车翻车等等。不在玩家附近时，人机的 位置 可能会在地图路线上随机移动或者移动到玩家附近。
人机无法修车和自主重置，玩家可以，因此玩家有非常大的优势。

Il reprend les ingrédients du 1, sans améliorer la recette.
On se retrouvera ainsi avec un moteur de jeu poussif qui ralentit même sur un pc de compétition, mais surtout des combats contre 12-20 ennemis, dont on attendra patiemment le tour; chaque map nécessitant de se plonger dans un affrontement qui s'éternise mollement et risque fort de mal finir -Blackguards n'a jamais été facile-, et qu'il faudra donc recommencer.

De plus, les références au JDR ne toucheront que les fans, rien n'étant prévu pour initier les néophytes.

Не думаю что и седьмая будет чем-то лучше чем эта. | An under rated entry in the Civilization series that unfortunately didn't get the support it needed from the developers. The idea of a desperate mission to another planet to colonize it and save the species is a hell of a starter. Choosing what to bring to ensure your success was something that needed to be expanded on but wasn't at launch. Another problem was too many people made parallels to Alpha Centauri thinking it was a reboot of sorts and the devs didn't do enough to dissuade people from that idea.

It hasn't aged well, but I still think it's in my top 10. | It's not *bad* per se, but it's not good either. There's a lot of stuff here that's just an objective step backward from Civ 5, even very simple UI stuff. Take for example the small bar that runs along the top of your screen in Civ games. This is used to display basic information, like what resources you have, what your general happiness level is, how many trade routes you have available and how many are active, etc. 

For some reason, in Beyond Earth they chose to REMOVE the trade routes from this bar. Now if you want to see how many trade routes you have and which are active, you have to click on ""additional information"" and then select the trade route overview. The ""additional information"" button is also on the bottom right now, along with spy overview and a bunch of other things. It's completely flipped from Civ 5 (and Civ 6), so it constantly throws your brain for a loop because you're not used to going to the bottom right corner for information. 

Diplomacy is also kind of a mess. From what I've been able to tell so far, there isn't actually a way to trade for resources. Your ""trade"" agreements with other civs are more like small-scale research agreements, and what you can barter for is dependent on the civ's personality. For example, Al Falah seems to be focused on production because their agreements give you stuff like an increase in energy yield for your capital, letting you build worker units for free, etc. It's not bad, you can get some useful stuff, it's just odd that you're not trading for actual resources. I don't have any Firaxite, the American Reclamation Corporation does. Why can't I just ask to trade for it? But what can be much worse is your actual relationship with other civs. If you are ""cooperating"" with another civ (this game's equivalent of being friendly), you may be tempted to form an alliance with them. For the love of god, DO NOT do this. I made the mistake of proposing an alliance with Al Falah and was IMMEDIATELY thrust into a war with every single civ they were at war with (half the civs on the map). 

Then there are other mechanics that are just half-baked. The xeno wildlife is this game's version of barbarians, and the *idea* behind them is cool. Most of them aren't outright hostile and they'll leave you alone as long as you don't get too close. You can destroy their nests to keep them from spawning if they're in the way, but that can be risky early on. They're all connected by a hive-mind so it'll make the rest of them REALLY mad at you. Conversely, you can research an ability that lets your explorers ""leash"" xeno units and make them your own (there's also research that let you produce your own xeno units). The problem is, leashing wild xenos is mostly pointless. They're quickly outpaced by normal military units, and you can't upgrade them. For example, the xeno cavalry unit is just humans riding on raptor bugs. If you leash a few wild raptor bugs, you *should* be able to upgrade them to cavalry units once you've researched alien domestication. But you can't. Why? I dunno.  

Most of the game is like this. There's a lot of neat ideas here, but none of them were ever fleshed out. Firaxis only released one DLC for this game and then promptly abandoned it. | Actually a lot of fun and way fewer bugs than CIV VII | I want to like this game but it crashes literally all the time.

I originally played a ton of this on Xbox years ago and loved revisiting it on PC, I definitely recommend a controller for the best experience.

The balancing feels somewhat off, it's very difficult on the 4th difficulty and pretty much too easy on the third, also you'll get punished and lose xp for playing on lower difficulties which makes utilizing new crew members just even more of an annoying grind. 

There are a couple of other game design choices which bothered me. You are only able to sell items in the loadout screen before a mission or when your inventory is full after a mission, whenever you are in a shop and want to buy something new but you are full you can't - you have to go back to a mission into the loadout screen, sell it there and then comeback - waiting for docking inbetween makes this even more of a pain. 

Whenever there are multiple enemies swarming you, they usually won't utilize the game mechanics of bouncing bullets against walls or rarely flank you, they will just run up to your cover, hold their barrel into it and shoot directly through it, into your face - which feels pretty lame and like not very well coded enemy behaviour. 

Whenever you get overwhelmed and fail a mission you'll lose a good chunk of your ingame curreny - so the entire process of making progress doesn't come down to how smart you play because the level design doesn't bring many opportunities to do so - it comes down how good you've grinded up your character level and gear. I don't think this is a good game design choice for a linear casual game. You'll utilize the same 3-4 squad members and you'll repeat the same gameplay loop over and over again until you've finished the game. If you can't continue you simply need to grind.  

Hats serve no purpose and are just for cosmetics. 

All in all the game feels like a rather shallow 2D X-COM and it definitely has it's flaws. I still think that it has charm and is fun for atleast a couple of hours. I'd barely recommend it whenever it's on heavy discount otherwise I wouldn't. (6/10) | [h1]Roboter im Weltall [/h1]

Nachdem ich mir den [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2396240/SteamWorld_Heist_II/]zweiten Teil[/url] bereits kostenlos dank des Kuratorenprogramms zur Gemüte führen durfte, habe ich mir mal den Vorgänger geholt. Erfahren wir einmal, ob er genau so viel Spaß macht.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
In „SteamWorld Heist“ ändert sich das 2D Buddelspiel der Vorgänger zu einem rundenbasierten Taktikableger. Wir schicken eine kleinen Trupp an Kämpfern mit verschiedenen Kämpfern in kleine Missionen und im besten Fall kommen auch genau so viele Kämpfer wieder aus der Mission raus. Jede Figur hat pro Runde zwei Aktionen zur Verfügung und verfügt einzigartige Fähigkeiten. Im ersten Teil gibt es noch kein Multi-Class Prinzip wie im [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2396240/SteamWorld_Heist_II/]zweiten Teil[/url]. Stattdessen haben die Bots zwar Klassen, entwickeln jedoch mit einem Level-Up einfach linear ihre eigenen Fähigkeiten. Dies schränkt gerade neu rekrutierte Bots erst einmal ein, aber man kann sich ja sehr frei entscheiden, welche Missionen man erledigen möchte oder auch welche Bots man immer mitleveln möchte. Persönlich mag ich es, wenn meine Leute ja ein ähnliches Level haben und relativ ausgeglichen sind.  Wir zielen übrigens selber und bekommen je nach Waffenwahl manchmal eine Hilfslinie. Das Knifflige daran? Die Leute sind etwas unruhig und viele Waffen haben keine Ziellinie, die wie beim Scharfschützen extrem hilfreich sein kann.
Kurzgesagt ist “Steamworld Heist” also ein Sidescroller [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/200510/XCOM_Enemy_Unknown/]XCOM[/url], in dem wir selber kalkulieren müssen, ob der Schuss ins Ziel geht oder nicht.  Der Aufbau der Level und die Art der Feinde werden dabei in jedem Level neu generiert. Also kann auch ein bereits erledigter Auftrag beim zweiten Mal ganz anders laufen. Das Spiel ist ohnehin darauf ausgelegt, dass man viele Level öfters spielt, da man eine gute Sternebewertung oder aber zusätzliche Beute und Erfahrung haben möchte. Trotzdem ist es mit ca. 15 Spielstunden nur halb so lang wie sein [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2396240/SteamWorld_Heist_II/]Nachfolger[/url].
Zum Spielen kann ich übrigens einen Controller empfehlen, mit dem man sich angenehm zurücklehnen kann.

[b]Story[/b]
Nachdem die Erde aufgrund bestimmter Ereignisse nicht mehr so ganz existiert, treiben sich die Bots auf verschiedenen „Scherben“ des Planeten herum und natürlich auch im Weltall. Piper Faraday will als Schmugglerin zwar überwiegend ihre Ruhe, allerdings bekommt sie diese Ruhe dank der Schrotter und der Marine nicht. Also beschließt die Dame auf eigene Faust mal so richtig durchzuräumen. Auf dem Weg kommen wir einer größeren Geschichte auf die Spur und unterhalten uns mit unseren rekrutierten Mitgliedern, die ihren ganz eigenen Charme mit einbringen. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3407461059
Allerdings darf man hier jetzt keine große Geschichte erwarten, die voller Plottwists ist. Stattdessen haben wir unsere eher oberflächlichen Helden und bekämpfen oberflächliche Feinde. Zum Verständnis hilft es, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/571310/SteamWorld_Dig_2/]SteamWorld Dig 2[/url] gespielt zu haben. Aber notwendig ist es sicherlich nicht. 

[b]Grafik/Sound[/b]
Die Grafik ist konsequent bunt gehalten. Ich mag den rostigen Stil und insbesondere die Machart der Charaktere. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3407463065
Man kann das Spiel problemlos auf Deutsch spielen. Allerdings gibt es dann doch manchmal Fehler bei den Texten, wodurch man den Sinn nicht mehr versteht. Ich nehme an, man hat da wirklich jemand Englischsprachigen das Spiel ins Deutsche übersetzen lassen. 

[b]DLCs[/b]
Die kosmetischen drei Hüte der Hatbox sind kostenlos verfügbar. Allerdings muss man die sich im Steam Shop manuell holen. Die andere Hatbox enthält ebenfalls nur Hüte, ist allerdings kostenpflichtig. Um man die braucht…Am Interessantesten dürfte das DLC „The Outsider“ sein, in dem wir ein neues Mitglied für unsere Crew bekommen, der eine Verbindung zum Vorgänger [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/571310/SteamWorld_Dig_2/]Steamworld Dig 2[/url] mitbringt. Diese Figur hat nicht nur im Kampf interessante Fähigkeiten, sondern bringt auch ein paar neue Missionen mit.

[b]Fazit[/b]
Genau wie der [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2396240/SteamWorld_Heist_II/]zweiten Teil[/url] hat mir auch der erste Teil sehr gut gefallen. Die Spiele ähneln sich zwar, aber dennoch kann ich beide klar empfehlen. Dieses Spiel fällt hier noch etwas flacher in den Spielmechaniken wie Klassen aus. Auch haben wir noch keine Oberwelt zu bereisen. Man könnte also sagen, der erste Teil ist simpler, aber auch das ist erfrischend. Leider wird es keinen dritten Teil geben, aber ich kann die „Steamworld“-Spiele, die sehr vielfältig sind, trotzdem sehr empfehlen. 


Rundenstrategie mag ich ja sehr. Für mehr davon und noch viel mehr Reviews in anderen Bereichen schau doch mal in [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Drakeschool] meiner Steamgruppe[/url] oder der [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ger_steam] German Steam Community[/url] vorbei! | This game is a really fun turn-based tactical shooter. However, it falls apart at the higher difficulties due to the alarm mechanic which forces a slower turn based gameplay into a rush as more enemies pile in which can quickly overwhelm you. This is even worse towards the end of the game as you get enemies which can teleport and shoot on the same turn with two or three enemies spawning each turn. This game definitely rewards quicker strategy over slow turn based turtling combat like XCOM. The 100% for this is also really difficult with the whole game being required to be completed on the highest difficulty with no mission failures, all missions fully completed, and in 800 turns or less across the whole game. | Com certeza é um dos melhores jogos de estratégia por turno que já vi.

[h3]Pros:[/h3]
-Visuals are great.
-Combat is somewhat intuitive.
-The hook of the story is great!

-Plays like a demo.
-Story is [b]WAY[/b] too short. Once you get past the first act, it feels rushed. 
-Level maps are far too small.
-Each act of the story is painfully short
-No open world exploration
-Collectibles aren't satisfying

This game had potential if it was given far more attention and patience than it got from development.  Each act should've been longer, to the tune of hours rather than minutes.  Exploring the map does not feel fulfilling.  The phalanx formations and siege tactics should have had more frequent use.  The story, again, far too short and deserved hours upon hours of more content.  This could have been an amazing game, Game of the Year even. If it was the producer, the publisher or someone else cutting corners to just get a product on the market, shame on you. This game deserved so much more.

There aren't many difficult choices for what to buy since what's optimal is obvious so if you're looking for everything to be relevant you picked the wrong game.

You ""fire"" a moon along your chosen trajectory with your specified power and it will move according to the laws of inertia and gravity.  Your aim is to collide the moon with asteroids until you gather a target amount of mass; you're supposed to be aiming for the gold asteroids to score points which lead to rewards of new levels etc.  Some of the asteroids are stuck in space, others also move.  There are other mechanics too: power your moon by rockets, control two moons, bomb asteroids that blow you up.  You can sort of work out roughly how the start point should be, you'll most likely miss by a small amount or a big amount and then fine-tune until you get it.

Each level has a ""joke"" comment, several sentences long, which aren't all that funny and are annoying to have to read because it's already enough to be learning the new mechanics when they come up.

It's a novel concept.  I like the idea.  I like the way the game looks and feels, it feels well-polished, asides from the ""jokes"".  But...  well, it's not a ""bad"" game, it's just... well... boring.

I have played about 20 levels so far and I do not feel compelled to play further.  It's a time burn.  It's fine if you're bored and don't want anything too strenuous to waste some time relaxing.  When I feel like that I'd rather read something or watch a film. | 无中可玩，鼓励性好评，2.1内可考虑入库。

This game is one of the coolest most interesting concepts for a game I've seen in the past decade.
I'm not going to compare this game to a MOBA or Twisted metal which is what every single review of this game does, instead I'm going to describe it all on it's own.

Heavy Metal Machines is a 4vs4 team based Battle Racing game. There is one simple objective, capture the bomb from the center of the map, and deliver it to the enemy's base, but it's not as simple as it sounds. Each team has their own race track on their side of the map that the enemy team has to transport the bomb through and your job is to stop them from getting there, intercept the bomb from them, and turn around to race it to their side of the map. With a plentyful roster of drivers with their own unique vehicles to choose from, you build a team of 4 with each player trying to fill one of 3 roles, Transporter, Interceptor, and Support.

The Transporter's skill set revolves around mobility and keeping posession of the bomb while ""transporting"" it to the enemy base.

As an Interceptor, you will be dealing damage to the enemy team's vehicles in an attempt to protect your bomb carrier, as well as taking theirs out.

And last but not least, The Support class is very important, you'll be shielding, healing, and dishing out crowd control to make sure your team delivers the bomb without a hitch, it's an invaluable role as well as a very satisfying and fun role to play.

Imagine a scene from Fast and Furious or Mad Max where a convoy of vehicles is battling it out for control of a precious cargo, that's what this game feels like, and it is just as awesome as it sounds.

Добрый День, хотел бы написать обзор по этой игре которую встретил в списке раннего доступа.Начну по порядку.
[b] Плюсы [/b]
[list]
    [*]Динамика игры просто изумительна, ее нельзя сравнивать с стандартной MOBA, бои проходят постоянно и такое впечатление что они не заканчиваются, а если это и просходит то только когда бомба залетает в ворота.
    [*]Економика в игре предельно проста и не вызывает каких-либо трудностей, в плане того, что покупать как и где, все направлено на ускорение игрового процесса.
    [*]Графика и музыкальное сопровождение приятное и не вызывает желания выключить музыку или звук, а фраза на старте ""Let the carnage begin!"" заставила меня окунуться в воспоминания детства, когда я нещадно давил на кнопки играя в R'N'RR.

[b] Минусы [/b]
[list]
    [*]За время игры из визуальных багов встретил только один, и тот был не значительным, а именно, после выигранного раунда, когда ""забивший гол"" делал круг почета вокруг статуи не было видно колес, а только их оси. В остальном за те 5 часов, что я провел в постоянных стычках, ничего подобного не наблюдалось.
    [*]Ливеры и АФКашники присутствуют и к сожаление пока с ними нет возможности бороться, некоторые просто бросают игру, а некоторые стоят на месте респа. Это досадно, надеюсь в будущем разработчики как-то ужесточат наказание за такие действия.

[h1] Заключение [/h1]
Игра действетельно стоящая, по той простой причине что подобного жанра игр я за долгое время не встречал, и я  надеюсь, что она найдет свою публику, ради которой будет развиваться ! 
 | Je fais partie de la vague de joueurs qui a découvert le jeu au lancement de la bêta, et pour l'instant j'en suis à 11h de gameplay -pas énorme donc, mais je commence à avoir une bonne idée de ce que ça pourrait donner. Je dois aussi dire que je ne suis pas familier des MOBA.

Mais pour l'instant, ce jeu me plaît vraiment beaucoup ! Il est original et dynamique, vraiment gratuit (tous les persos sont utilisables sans aucune restriction), et assez bien équilibré -tous les persos sont utilisables avec divers degrés de raffinement. 

Je vois deux points négatifs: 
- des légers problèmes de stabilité, ce qui fait qu'on tombe sur pas mal de joueurs afk (et s'il manque un joueur, sur une team de 4 c'est vite chaud)
-une seule map
-la B.O. (qui est bien METAAAAAAAAAAAAL, pas de souci là-dessus) pourrait à mon sens être un peu plus travaillée 

Mais évidemment, on n'en est encore qu'à la bêta ! Vu comme les développeurs sont réactifs (exemples: posé une question sur un forum, eu réponse dans l'heure; problèmes de matchmaking un jour pris en compte le lendemain), j'ai confiance dans le bon déroulement de ce projet !

Franchement, à tester ! | Cara o jogo é muito dahora...

Então...

Ai entra a trilha sonora fudida(pra quem gosta de um metal e pra quem nao gosta e prefere um rap ou pagodinho, não se preocupe a trilha sonora desse jogo vai fazer você entrar dentro daquele carro), os carros, as armas, a destruição e os itens que você compra pra aprimorar os carros durante as partidas, assim como todo MOBA.

A única coisa que eu diria que por em quanto é ruim, mas como todo jogo beta tem, são os poucos úsuarios, então demora pra achar partidas, mas sinceramente é um jogo que tem tudo pra dar certo e ter muitos e muitos jogadores.

Bora jogar? | Increible. Realmente es una formula que tiene mucha clase de por si, ofrece muchisimo entretenimiento y la posibilidad de conseguir la gran inmensa mayoria del contenido sin pagar dinero real, a parte de que las misiones diarias y el leveo hacen que consigas ''Fama'' (Moneda que se consigue jugando) de forma facil y periodica.

76561197970698176,333930,Dirty Bomb®,68.0,"Action, Free To Play",34,"Lets dismiss the rumor that this game is Pay 2 Win, it actually isn't anywhere close to it. If you were to personally ask me what P2W is, I'd say, ""Games with weapons or unlockables (Generally ones that give you an advantage or are just overpowered) not obtainable through playing the game for free, instead using real world money to unlock it.""

TL;DR: Everything above Bronze in loadouts is cosmetic. Characters rotate to play for free every week.

How this game works is entirely different, you get loadout cards, now while you might think, ""Oh, well that must mean that everything Silver and Gold is better than things that are Bronze."" This is not correct, every card above Bronze simply works as a form of cosmetic.
On the other hand you have people that would say, ""Getting a Bronze card would mean you have way too many advantages over players that don't."" This is also not true, as the bronze cards simply give you perks on the side that give you small boosts, no gun damage, health (Except for one perk that gives you up to 30 health for dying multiple times) or other character attributes altered with cards.

Now with these loadout cards, you also get different weapons. These weapons on the loadout cards will change how you play your character. By default you have good loadouts, you can destroy anybody with the basic loadouts so long as you can aim, your guns make you, not your perks. You can get a different gun for every rarity of loadout, even the worst rarities come with guns that can change how you play by alot, but for the most part all the guns are reletively balanced.

Next comes the whole RNG thing that people get very angry at because they can't find good things in cases. 1000 ingame credits = 1 case, this case grants you 1 random loadout card in the game, with the higher tier rarities being lower chances of obtaining, but still possible. if you really want to go all out, you can spend 5 dollars in real world money for some random cases that are primarily used for the higher chance at getting Gold and Cobalt loadouts, but still guarenteed a Silver loadout.

The crafting system is next and it's pretty simple, put in cards you don't like of the same rarity and get the next loadout rarity up, you also select any of the characters that you want a loadout specifically for. Essentially trade up contracts in CS:GO. Pretty easy to understand, gives you another chance at randomizing and it's a way of letting you get loadouts that are Silver and higher without the RNG chance, however the weapons and perks are randomized each time. 
With that being said, if you find that you can't be bothered to open up cases for 1000 ingame credits, you can simply save up enough to just buy a bronze loadout that you like.

Next comes characters. Here's where people have whined most about the game. ""6-10 Dollars for a single character in this game? What a ripoff!"" And here's where I come in and say ""You don't need to spend money, blah blah blah, you can play the game normally and get every character you just need to save up a bit.""
On top of this, there is a free character rotation every week. Just like in League of Legends, every week three characters become unlocked for the week's duration as playable characters, afterwards you need to purchase them to keep them permanently.

To end this I'm simply going to put it. The game is fun, not Pay 2 Win, and it's starting to take up time I would spend playing Tf2. | Most fun I've had with an FPS in a long time. Pretty fast-paced combat, classes aren't too gimmicky. Anyone who digs Enemy Territory or thought Brink had a ton of potential should definitely check it out | I find DB has drifted from what I would want in a game to something I don't like. More importantly, I don't think it will improve enough to enjoy going forward, so I'm going to uninstall DB.

The fundamental reason I'm going to uninstall is that the initial and early characters didn't feel too gimmicky, and they tended to work together. Since that time, they've become more and more ridiculous. Constantly putting in characters that don't really mesh together isn't helping the team aspect of the game. When you can help your team while still shooting the enemy and not need to make a decision about which to do, you have a problem. Throwing health packs, ammo, and needing to be on top of people to revive them encourages smart team play. ""Don't run into the open, we can't pick you up"" Sparks the medic comes out, and more fools over-extend because you can revive them now at a distance, instead of them being dead and gibbed, and they can be picked up. Not being revived is the game punishing bad play by those who over-extend. Javelin dispenses ammo even in fire-fights, so who needs to manage and plan for their ammo? Getting into long fire-fights back in 2015 used to require someone to be very good at managing ammo and position. You had to bring a support character, but that person needed excellent positioning to be able to toss that pack and hit a teammate who needs it without giving it to the enemy, and then quickly be back in the fight. The same is true of the medics. Running a combo of medic/ammo giver required great support. Automatically dispensing ammo in a circle around you doesn't force you to think about how to help your team, and you can help without actively helping. You can both help you team with a power, and shoot an enemy. This isn't encouraging teammates to help each other, it just encourages them to bunch up. Further, key abilities can be done by everyone, like repairing, planting explosives, and reviving. This dilutes the need to take certain classes at all.

Further, rarely has a new character been balanced on release, which means in the the intervening time between release and patch you face a lot of people playing a broken character. In-fact, new characters were never allowed straight into ranked. They would hold them back because they knew they weren't balanced. They eventually gets nerfed, frequently too far, and the cycle repeats. This is irritating, but I also know that characters aren't balanced until you really get a lot of people playing them. I don't know why they feel so far off each time, but I suspect it is because of the aforementioned decision to keep pushing out characters that have odd abilities that need to be special to justify making a new merc. Balancing among more and more abilities also takes more and more effort - effort that could be spent making the one thing that doesn't get enough attention - maps.

Maps. You need more maps. You always need more maps. More maps means more unique strategies, it means you can play a lot of matches without repeating maps (back when there were only 6 maps, I took lots of several week or several month breaks because I didn't want to play the same maps over and over). Each map should highlight a few abilities. You can get the objective done without them and successfully defend without them, but on some maps, some characters should shine without being overpowered. Each map should be able to take advantage of each merc's abilities. I know this is a tall order, but you want to be great, right? The more abilities you have, the more trouble you have where you get into a map and think, ""I brought a terrible merc for this map."" That should not happen, ever. Rhino is a good example. There are some maps where I will never take him, he's far too slow, and he needs to be on top of people to do damage. There are too many maps where he cannot do much, and very few maps where he can truly shine. Similarly, taking Skyhammer or Arty in Underground, is a waste of time (Skyhammer's marker does act like a grenade, but it isn't a great one). Stoker, on the other hand, dominates in Undergound because his ability is always useful. There is no need for that enormous discrepancy between characters. This removes flexibility to form and break defenses. 

While this is definitely a personal preference, the worst part about this game is being one-shot. I don't know why people think this is fun in an arcade-style shooter. In ARMA, SWAT, Rainbow 6, being one-shot killed is fine and I like those games, but not in a game like this. It wasn't fun 20 years ago with the rocket launchers in Quake and Unreal, it still isn't now. The wide-spread availabilty and ease-of-use of one-shot weapons in this game is killing my enjoyment (and I realize that this is a very personal complaint, hence the reason I listed it last). The fact that most people cannot use one-shot weapons well in a fast-moving arcade-style shooter doesn't make them balanced. In any game, when you balance to the average, you neglect that part of the population who will take the time needed to perfect the one-shot (or power, skill, etc.) who will still continue to dominate with over-powered weapons/abiliites, etc. This is where the accurate arcade-style shooting and movement work against you - perfecting that one-shot is 100% doable. I've met and seen plenty of people who have perfected it. For awhile, I could do it pretty well, but it felt really cheap and dirty, so I stopped. Once you master the one-shot kill, it's a joke for those who don't. Removing scope sway on snipers - terrible move, the sway at least made the one-shot kills reasonably rare but threatening. The reviver railgun of doom - terrible move. I still stuck around, despite really not liking these changes. The additional of Javelin was another change that I didn't like. What purpose does she serve? There are characters who can break-up camps, if they're not doing the job, adjust them! Instead, you put in the one-shot rocket of doom, something I was really proud of you for not putting in the game from day one. An arcade style game balanced without a rocket launcher. Ponder that. We had that.

Coming back after a long break, I wanted to see how the game progressed. I see the new characters introduced, and one of them is Hunter - he has a crossbow that can one-shot people. After playing a few games against people with Hunter, I can see once again that the higher-skilled players are STILL taking the high-damage sniper rifles, and Hunter. I used to accept being one-shot as part of the game, but I just don't want to deal with it anymore. If I want to be killed in one shot while moving around a corner, I'll play the SWAT and Rainbow 6 games - realistic shooters. Not in arcade shooters. I want teamwork, but that can't be had, because not enough abilities force you to support or rely your team. I used to think that the self-healing that all mercs have was fine, but as time went on, I found myself drawn to characters that had ""tough"" perk because I didn't need a medic. Ammo is easy to come by, generally, and rarely do you need to go far out of the way to get it, so who needs those pesky teammates? Going to get ammo shouldn't be easy, a team game should prefer you to get it from teammates, and hence punish you by having inconvenient ammo supply locations.

In case you are wondering, I don't play Overwatch. I saw enough in the videos to know that it wasn't what I was looking for. And now, very sadly, I must conclude that Dirty Bomb joins it.

Finally, I apologize for mistakes - I edited this heavily to make sure my thoughts were coordinated, but I suspect there are errors still left. | Back in 2003, Splash Damage released a standalone freeware game known as Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.  It combined the speed and movement of Quake and the hitscan and aiming mechanics of Counter-Strike into a objective-based game.  The focus on team-oriented objectives created a very popular fps game that sadly had a community die off and move on.

Splash Damage attempted to revive the series with with Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, but was largely unsucessful.

Welcome to Dirty Bomb, the newest reincarnation of the gameplay.  It feels and plays like the first legitemate sucessor to Enemy Territory.  With similar team-based classes, and a much more noob-friendly interface than ET could ever muster, this game could possibly be the first game that is a legitemate competitor to CSGO in terms of competitive FPS games... as long as Nexon doesn't FUCK everything up and make the game p2w.

The shooting mechanics combine that of quake and counter-strike.  Players are tanky and can take 2 or 3 headshots to kill.  However, similar to CS, aiming for the head is highly rewarding as most guns will kill in 8 to 10 shots (generally it takes a little less than 2 seconds to kill a player with body shots).  Additionally, you're highly accurate while moving, which makes strafe shooting a viable and effective strategy.

Don't let the cartoonish atmosphere fool you, however.  Despite its simplistic nature, there is a lot of depth to the game in taking fights, healing with medics, and even intentionally suiciding to respawn with full ammo or to defend an objective.

If you like playing competitive FPS games, give this one a fair shot.  The gameplay is quite unforgiving for new players, but highly rewarding if you stick with it. | By far my favorite FPS game on PC and one of the best i've played ever, with the added plus that it is FREEE! While it is not pay to win, it definitly requires skill and somewhat good reaction speed. It is incredibly fast paced, with battles happening across the various maps. It has a selection of 20 different mercs, with an array of abilities that include but not limited to land mines, airstrikes,and revive guns. It's devs pay close attention to their fan base and always try to respond, while keeping them up to date with every new piece added to the game. All in all, the best PC game I have played yet and it receives the highest recommendations I can give. A game worth playing :D

edit:they have added even more characters and weapons,
and I want my nomination task finished. Play Dirty!

Main problem is balance. Game is too easy or too difficult. Nothing in-between. Battle skills are useless because in easy fights you don't need them and in difficult ones - they won't save you.

It is not a bad game, it is not a bad Carmageddon game. It is simply a game that wasn't developed by Stainless. It does lack certain things that the older titles had, but it definitely does not deserve to be called a turd or a bad game because of this. 

It has a different structure from the older titles in terms of progression/missions which I feel is a decent middle-of-the-road sort of deal. You do one race and then one mission, for 6 total per section. This means you do get less map variety, as it's the same map for 3 races, just a different route, but it does also let you go back and forth between the levels, unlike Carma 2. It also has more of a story than the previous games, as well as more of the full on post-apocalyptic atmosphere and feel that the previous titles simply do not; in Carmageddon 1 & 2 it feels like the races are just happening and do not have or have not had much of an effect on society or the environment. Here, they do. It feels like people are trying to survive as best they can but also just being highly aggressive towards you on occasion rather than being either immediately scared or frankly apathetic to you.

The car selection is also honestly not in any way remotely bad, it does feature even more references to pop culture and the movies that have been an inspiration to the series, such as two cars from Mad Max that you can buy throughout the game.
There is also a simple skins system that lets you tweak the way the car works through the textures themselves, providing an easy way to change the way the car looks, to suit your tastes better as well as to directly show that this car is now yours and not the opponent that you yoinked it from.

It’s a randomized shoot ‘em up game that heavily relies on RNG which can also lead to frustration when it comes to hunting achievements, but since each wave takes about 10 seconds long, it’s not that bad, I guess. At the end of each wave, you get to a shop and are presented with 3 different items with bizarre descriptions that give not-so-useful information about the item you’re about to get for the next wave. Different guns, extra fish, and the fishbowl last until they’re gone, but the rest of the items last for a single wave only. You technically have 3 unique bosses and 3 more with their variants and after that, the game ends and you are rewarded with Victory Laps that go on and on. 

Apart from the normal game mode, you have a baby mode that has only 2 bosses and no real rewards, Boss Rush, and a game mode that is much more difficult and gives you one chance throughout the whole run. You can also play co-op and it’s quite fun! If you’re after the achievements, all of them can be completed rather quickly, but 3 of them can be quite frustrating due to their reliance on RNG.

What better a game to do so than one about a fish with realistic biceps and a 10 second long memory span?

Let's face it, you already know what this game is about. You shoot stuff. However, this game is unlike many other shmups because you shoot stuff in high volume for very short amounts of time. 10 seconds to be exact. And then you get to pick one of three upgrades - within 10 seconds. And then that upgrade lasts (depending on the upgrade) for the next 10 seconds of shooting before it's gone. This mechanic not only ties you to your avatar - a fish with arms - using gameplay in a very clever and intuitive way, but it also gives for a fast paced, replayable, arcade-like game.

Aside from the main mechanics, the controls are responsive and simple, the upgrades are hilarious (sometimes infuriatingly so), the visuals are pleasing, and the music is the best culmination of 10 second long chiptune tracks that I've ever heard. I think the only thing that could improve this game is a 3DS port so I can bring it with me everywhere. | Pretty smart game, with a very good sense of humour, and a sort of perks-driven progression that is a lot of fun.

76561197970698176,319630,Life is Strange - Episode 1,0.6166666666666667,"Action, Adventure",1,"[b]An intimate diary tribute to the 10th anniversary of Max’s journey.[/b]

It used to be a tradition for me to play [i]Life is Strange[/i] every New Year’s Eve when visiting my childhood home. So many memories intertwine with it. Jumping up and down on the bed losing my mind after the 3Ep twist. Bugging my classmates with a basket of theories and insane lore about the game's development. Cutting my hair slowly bit by bit until it eventually resembled Max's. I learned Spanish Sahara by heart and played it non-stop on the ukulele I begged my parents to buy. Even the wall of my room was decorated in Max's style – a tradition I carry to all the homes, or the resemblance of homes, I've changed along the way. In 11th grade, I made Max’s journal from scratch, it was one of my favorite pieces in the room, taking a notable place among my own personal and school diaries. I remember playing the 4th episode on a school week until 6am and going straight to school all hyped and simultaneously out of it. When Episode 5 came out, I sobbed for two weeks! My best friend at that time and I woke up so early that day, purposefully missed school, and spent all day immersed in that final chapter – her watching a live stream and I cursing at my old computer unable to handle Max’s time jumping shenanigans; of course, taking occasional breaks for comparing our declining emotional stability. [i]Life is Strange[/i] carried me from that final school year straight to University, helping me figure out some stuff about my own life along the way; as it did to many. Every time I turn it on now it just turns into a crying fest. From love, of course. But also sorrow.

Over the years, I’ve read so many players' intimate recollections prompted by the game's content; random snippets of people’s most vulnerable life stories sprinkled over each social media platform. Simply something awoken in people of all ages and backgrounds, perhaps by the game’s mellow nostalgic aesthetics and unabashed willingness to attune to the finest memories and emotions of our hearts. It was rather pleasant to witness the resurgence of [i]LiS[/i] fandom in late 2024, collectively reminiscing on our intimate interaction with the story, the newfound change in perspectives, and the passionate desire to mutually share all the warmth we still have for its characters. 

Living through Max was foundational for me, a self-conscious girl growing into confident adulthood with innocence violently ripped away from her. It was simply an average coming-of-age process, growing up and seeing a world from a different perspective, learning to connect and empathize with those around, learning from them and finding our own flaws and desires, recognizing them and growing to be better. But also a darker experience of going through my own sexual assault, of losing my own innocence, shifting and modifying the self to perhaps be more cynical and pragmatic, of maybe seeing the world through a darker yet necessary lens. Yet, ultimately, all of it forming one unified identity that is nevertheless a beautiful landscape of variable experiences and lessons; adulthood. I will always love the character of Max dearly. I will always cry noticing the gradual change of her vibrant diary doodles to objective, subdued in color entries with each passing chapter. I will always cry for the innocent love Max finds in non-innocent circumstances. The exploration of Max’s fractured mind following the violation will always mean the world to me, back in 2015 making me feel seen and motivated to start my own tumultuous journey of healing. I will always be grateful for Don’t Nod creating this beloved gamified companion to project our own internal worries onto, our transformations, and dreams; to reach intimate answers through a bittersweet, meditative experience.

[i]Life is Strange[/i] maintains sheer gratitude and wonder for each part of our environment while not rejecting the truth of the shadows stretching over the world’s corners. Finding beauty in the industrial powers of small towns, their nature, expansion in infrastructure, transformation of beliefs, unique differing people, and their interconnected messy ties to each other: as colleagues, students, friends, lovers. Finding beauty in the contrast of lives cut short, resentments, domestic disputes, destructive truths, violence, and uncertainty of tomorrow. Creating a living, breathing town that wishes to continuously evolve, grow, and adapt to the changing population making up its geographical landscape. Rachel Amber’s character is perhaps the most compassionate interpretation of Laura Palmer’s image I have seen, Chloe’s uncensored journey of clawing through grief calls to the most helpless moments of my own 19old self, and the understanding of violence captured in a human-shaped form still wounds me deeply: of course, so much of [i]LiS[/i] was inspired by and carried love for David Lynch’s legacy.


It's not so much the content of media; over time it becomes something bigger than its key narrative points. Rather, the events it accompanied in life, the memories you associate it with. That's when stories become truly dear to the heart no matter the years passed. It simply evokes a subdued feeling, like a thread granting the privilege to time travel to your own thoughts, memories, tastes, smells, relationships, places.

I tried replaying this game in so many locations now it can be drawn onto a map, like a shi+ty road trip. But I never lasted very long, about 30 minutes before I lose my cool completely and start thinking of the hand-drawn picturesque walls of my school. Of the captured memories sprinkled over my walls. Of the path to my home from school, from my friends, from the center, from my mom's job, from the park, from the waterfront. Of the last school days and giving away my books. Of getting closer with my classmates and finally understanding how similar we are. Of looking out my window, the windows of my friends, the windows of my school – and seeing sunsets, sunrises, golden hours, whirlwinds, blizzards, screeching hot days. Of dark days. Of town spots I avoid. Of town spots I wish could stay with me. A living breathing town… trapped in hazy, fleeting pieces of memory. Out of reach, a resemblance of something that used to be, overwritten by new places and people – when it's one of the last anchors you have to that past you cannot go back to. Learning to hold the value of delicate memory, accept darkness, and cherish its lighter undertones.

Finally replaying the game after these years, I’ve been finding new connections with Arcadia Bay, of the radical shift it makes from a nostalgic warm town to a harbor of ruin. How it strongly encompasses both, yet neither. I’ve been thinking of how the geography of my town has been modified, its prior identity forever wiped away. I’ve been countering the grief of losing childhood physically and emotionally with the fleeting traces of glee that used to be. On dark days, I will always hold on to the memory of sitting on the hot-to-the-touch boulder stone with my childhood friend, giggling about our new life developments, surrounded by forestry of a quiet park and bright sun. Of looking around me and seeing kids become more expressive in their identities, unafraid to look, think, and love however they please. Of regularly visiting my school and checking in to see if the asphalt drawing we made in dedication to our class teacher has faded away, or the chamomiles covering the school’s entrance are still greeting the children. Of peaking outside from the large plants covering my mom’s windowsill and seeing the rose we have planted outside slowly rise and bloom. Of always having a prepared 2h15m playlist to accompany me on the trip to my town from the nearby big city.

Nowadays, [i]Life is Strange[/i] transports me to the hot summer days of my home. 
I will always be grateful for having a chance to time travel. | I've been wondering for a long time whether ""Life is Strange"" is a game I could recommend or not, since it has very positive reviews and a slew of fans. I also expected such an experience. Unfortunately, I have to admit that the game disappointed me. Don't get me wrong, I fell in love with the demo version (chapter one), which promised an elaborate crime story with several suspects and lots of decision-making. We were introduced to the characters along with our heroine (Max), as she was new to the school. It promised a story full of excitement, mystery and consequences of our choices.

Unfortunately, after purchasing the full version of the game, with all the chapters (21 hours played), the spell faded in several different ways:

1. The game turned out to be a delusion of the consequences of the choices (except for the final decision at the end - although this one is disappointing in terms of the logic of the choice and the realization of the consequences, especially in the case of one final).
 
2. The game deliberately distracts us from some characters, completely forgetting them as criminal suspects. Because of this, we are unable to gather evidence in their case. Which is then supposed to cause surprise, shock, etc. - A cheap, ineffective ploy.

3. Overly cinematic final chapters. At one point in the game, there was so much story told in interludes and stills that for most of the chapter, the player had nothing to do but minor linear activities that contributed nothing. This killed my immersion and and even more my sense of control and decision-making.

4. Little bugs. The ending cutscenes have a number of close-ups of characters talking without their mouths moving. There are so many of them that at some point it becomes uncomfortable. The time reversal system is also sometimes unintuitive and can erase a decision even though it was not intended.

**[Warning: little spoilers]**

5. Final decisions: It is supposed to arouse emotions, but whether it does so is not necessarily the case. The first ending looks good and emotional, but the second one is dull and bland. In addition, it shows that everything we did throughout the game is irrelevant to our protagonist Max (all the friendships we've made, the lives we saved, etc.). That's not how you write good endings.

6. Imbalance in the characterization of the characters. Just as most of the characters are good written (they have their own motives, secrets, behaviors and are believable), I cannot say the same about two of the main characters who should arouse sympathy - Chloe and (maybe) Warren.
The friendship between Max and Chloe is, in my opinion, completely one-sided. Chloe uses Max's skills like a toy, she doesn't accept criticism, she's explosive and I didn't get the impression that she actually cared about her friend or even respected her, her character and way of being. Thus, he forces her to engage in various activities, even though Max points out that such activities are not to her liking or even can hurt her. Despite this, Max keeps repeating wonderful words about lifelong friendship and can also create a love bond with her. The only positive aspect of Chloe's character is at the end, when she realizes all these elements and talks about them, and makes her first unselfish decision.
As for Warren, he's written strangely. He's supposed to be a geek with a crush on Max, and he basically is, but throughout the entire game I had the impression that there was something strange about him and that he was hiding something. | 沉浸感无敌，剧情不拖泥带水，就是克洛伊像个啥币，看后续剧情发展吧 | This is one of the best video game stories ever told – a true classic.

I never once felt like I knew where I was going and quickly grew frustrated at having to change the bullets one-by-one. There's a rapid reload ability, so why is there no rapid ammo-swap ability? Such a simple feature would have made the game far more bearable. | UPDATE: Literally within hours of posting this they put out two updates/patches, one of which fixed the original bug that prevented progress after a certain point. While the other points still stand, they've  fixed the issue (at least for me) on saves that kill completion of the game. However, at this price point, I'd still wait at least for sale to get at least your money's worth for the first few hours.

First off - in terms of style, humor, and mood this game delivers exactly what you're looking for. It's witty, tongue-in-cheek, and one of those games where I could be posting screenshots all day.

In many ways, it feels as if the developers and creators spent a lot of love and time starting the game and creating the idea, but eventually lost interest or ran into production issues because the game starts strong but quickly devolves into frustrating platforming puzzles and a punishing gauntlet of bugs.

In early levels and stages, you're rewarded for your exploration with secret areas, collectibles, and so on. But later on, you run the risk of finding a collectible or jumping through an invisible wall which will render you unable to escape and forcing you to use the last savepoint to resume your progress. It got to a point where it felt like a rogue-like of chancing whether or not I would bug out or find a collectable. 

The save checkpoints are cute and humorously executed, because as many times as you do it it never quite gets old - however the sloppiness in code execution, combined with long distances between savepoints ultimately has led to a point where I can resume yet find myself in a place unable to complete the game, essentially remembering my location in a map yet resetting all the doors, trapping me inside.

I really REALLY wanted to love this game - and in many ways I still do - but unfortunately because of the large number of bugs and sloppy techncial execution towards the end I can't recommend it in the state it's in. Rule one should be - you must be able to finish the game. | I came into this game really wanting to like it. I'd watched 'Nerd3 plays...' of it and the clever dialouge drew me in. The art style is  fresh though at times I feel its a bit too sharp around the edges and needed more polish. I do feel the people who made it had their hearts in the right places and wanted to make a good homage to the noir genre.

Disclaimer: I'm not good at platformers and this game turned out to be one. I wasn't aware of this when I bought it. I thought it'd be a P.I. puzzle solving, collecting evidence kinda game. On closer inspection '3D Platformer' is in the description as a bulletpoint and as a tag however the screenshots and trailer don't show this. It was too late for me to refund though.
I haven't finished the game so I can't comment on the story. Look to other reviews for that.

Pros: Clever/funny dialouge, lives and breathes the noir genre, cute rats that are not automatically bad guys (just a personal one).

Cons: The platforming! Clunky controls, very difficult puzzles in the factory level that require more precision than the game allows (I'm stuck here). The gun bullets at first seem an interesting way of doing things but the slow reloading of them becomes labourious quickly and its difficult to tell which bullet you'll be firing first.

Conclusion: I really wanted to like this game for its great character however I felt like I was constantly fighting it as I progressed due to stubborness rather than enjoyment. The factory level was the last straw for me. Some tightening of the controls and maybe more visual hints would go a long way. | I'm a fan of the noir genre and I was pleasantly surprised when I came across Hot Tin Roof; noir and kitty-cats, what could be better, right?

I like it, it was charming with its graphics, atmosphere, and I enjoyed each individual character's personality.
The music was great, too!

One of the game's key features was a revolver that aquired special abilities for each type of bullet you collect: Blowing bubbles, lighting torches, using a grappling hook, and more. 
It was a fun and unique trait for this game.

The initial premise is good, but, there are a couple of issues.

The game may seem long, and it does take awhile to beat, but the story itself is a lot shorter due to the complex puzzles.
So, if you do decide to buy it, I recommend taking your time exploring the game so you get as much out of it as possible.

The game is fairly frustrating at times and it's easy to get lost in the 'puzzle areas', though it's less infuriating as The Impossible Game, thankfully. 

I had hoped that the story and the side quests would've been a bit longer. The noir genre relies on good story-telling and it just seemed to be lacking in this game, but I guess that's due to the strong emphasis on the platformer puzzles, so take it with a grain of salt.

Also, there are times when you can purchase items in the game. However, I found that it was very easy to mine for money early on, and once I bought most of everything that was available, money became useless.
It would've been really nifty if I had been able to bribe characters for clues or tips to progress a case or complete a side quest. 

If there is a sequel for Hot Tin Roof (and I do hope there are plans for it because it was delightful!), I hope that Emma's cat partner, Franky, can do more than just act as a guide; I felt that at times she wasn't too helpful and she did get in the way when I fired the revolver, but she was good company. 

Overall, I enjoyed the game and there is replayability value since there are various side quests to seek out and there are (from what I've read) around fifteen different endings. 

If you like noir, cats, and puzzles that are more complex than what you'd find in Mario - I'd say it's worth a try! | 这是一个猫、鼠和方块人平等生活的城市，主角Emma Jones是一个女私家侦探（完全看不出是女的，而且为啥私家侦探能有逮捕的权力？），而她的搭档是同样戴着软呢帽的母猫Franky。通过调查四个案件，获取各种武器及线索，最后可以达成三个犯人以及主角的各4种结局（其中某个犯人只有3个结局）的结局组合。

虽然是3D场景，但实际是2D横版，通过上下键来进行纵轴的移动，有些地方也会直接转90度，而且游戏也不提供地图，就连相对简单的城市大地图都绕得晕，更不用说几个迷宫了。地图到处都是厕所，其中蹲马桶是存档，洗手是回血（有个成就注释就是妈妈叫你洗手，也就是要满血状态通关）。

游戏内解谜主要是通过途中收集的各种子弹，左轮手枪里一共有4发子弹，而装弹时游戏不是暂停的，因此有些地方需要算好4发子弹的排列。子弹效果如下：
普通弹：没有特殊效果，但某些物体必须用普通弹才能破坏
泡泡弹：可以发现地图中的隐藏物体，部分隐藏物体会有黄色闪烁提示
钩爪弹：击中部分物体或墙可以把自己钩过去
燃烧弹：可以点燃部分物体和场景内的蜡烛等
击退弹：使物体前进一段距离，同时自己也后退一段距离，一般用来推动物体，以及连发用来爬墙
果冻弹：射出一个果冻，可以卡位，人踩上去会不能移动，点燃后会爆炸，主要用来破坏那种有大裂缝的墙

收集要素包括16朵花（每4朵花+1生命上限）、4个金币、8个银币和16个普通币，普通币远远不止16个倒无所谓，但银币和背景色很接近还是很容易遗漏的。最后一个成就据开发者说是和新作有关，但新作最近好像出了而这边却还没更新……","The game is a bit of a letdown, but it's fun and a bit of a roguelike."

(It will disable achievements). It's still a fantastic cyberpunk CRPG with a XCOM like system, also comes with a lengthy post game DLC that is free. 

The game is also the most old Bioware in it's progression system and companion quests, while Dragonfall had the major elements, HK flesh them out a just enough to flesh out further. 

The true shining reason HK is the best is it's custom workshop campaigns. ""The Caldecott Caper"" and ""CalFree in Chains"" are two full sized games that use the same old Bioware like structure and are loosely connected with each other, all for no additional cost and are purely fan made. 

There is also Vox Populi, a custom campaign that back ported the first Shadowrun returns game in full plus companions and companion quests, again, for free.

76561197970698176,266510,Hand of Fate,0.7333333333333333,"Action, Indie, RPG",2,"As with HoF2, Hand of Fate delivers an unprecedented and unique mix between deckbuilder, dungeon crawler, and action RPG. Also as with HoF2, there are glaring flaws in the implementation of mechanics, this time particularly with the Chance Card game and the action RPG combat itself.  
My issue with the Chance Cards is that it is the only minigame you have available to you. HoF2 rectifies this by introducing several others that aren't almost entirely RNG or perception-based: some moreso, some less so, but it all balances out. You also have a greater variety of equipment for dealing with or ""gaming"" certain minigame types. Hand of Fate has maybe two pieces of equipment that will help contribute to your success at Chance Cards.  
The action RPG combat is by far the WORST part of the game. While it's fluid and more dynamic (more options) in HoF2, HoF's combat is plagued by HORRIBLE camera movement and maneuverability of character. Too many times have I gotten stuck on a piece of terrain, surrounded by multiple enemies, and stunlocked by unavoidable attacks. On top of that, enemy HP feels much tankier than HoF2, which draws out combat encounters long enough that I began to feel the game was no longer respecting my time.  
Altogether, at this point in the game's life, I would have to say skip this one and try out HoF2 instead. While that entry has its own share of problematic features, they are not insurmountable, and the breadth of equipment and card types available allow you to take a more tailored approach towards the game's various encounters and challenges.  
Edit: Another thing I wanted to touch on is how some of the token chains for encounter cards feel REALLY unbalanced, requiring you to either repeatedly draw and complete the card's challenge with increasing requirements AND harder Chance Cards, or complete at least three Chance Card challenges with success or Huge Success. This is frustrating and a huge turn-off, but what I've come to understand is Defiant Development LOVES implementing things like this, as they were complained about also by users when HoF2 was fresh, and some things had to be nerfed. Engage with these cards at your own risk of sanity. | O jogo em si é bem legal, Já a platina é cansativa pra porra | очень интересная задумка, хорошая реализация, но ты умрёшь. тебя убьёт либо тупость героя, когда вместо того, чтобы атаковать стоящего рядом врага, герой начнёт давать пощёчины лежащему телу, пока ему уже летит топор, чтобы расколоть пустую черепушку, либо голод , потому что толпа крестьян не взяла половину еды и забрала всё, харкнув тебе в рожу, или же ты умрёшь чисто по приколу, потому что  тебе из-за экрана кинули сквозь тела стоящих противников нож, который ты не смог парировать, ведь щит у тебя слямзили два события назад , когда ты бухал с очень сильной, очень независимой, но очень несчастной алкоголичкой | Really good and really hard.

I thought she would love to try this. Within five minutes she was back at the place she grew up, giggling and squeeling with delight. Then she went up ""Tandle Hill"" and suddenly I noticed she wasn't laughing anymore.

I asked her if she was ok, and I noticed she was quietly crying and shaking. ""What's the MATTER""?, I asked.

""I haven't been here since I was a little girl; this is so wonderful - thank you so much, I never thought I would ever come here ever again"".

THAT, my friends, is worth the cost of the Vive itself.


Pro's: Become Superman/Supergirl and go where you like; visit your own house; go to that place you always wanted to; sit on cliffs and scare yourself to death; ""Leap"" from tall buildings; Take off and go into space then land on the other side of the planet; go to that holiday place again (without the traffic jams); play a game of ""can I find it again from space without getting lost on the way down""; save your own favourites and jump straight there next time.

IN MY OPINION - the best and most enduring VR experience ever, and probably for a long time to come.

Cons:

Well, not really any, but I would like to see the following features added as this gem is polished:

To be able to leave human scale on ALL THE TIME. I know it is great to feel like Gulliver, walking between the mountains or skyscrapers, but for immersion I'd like to be able to leave my eyes 70mm apart and view the Earth in normal scale (at least have the option).

Ability to reverse the ""BRAKE"" option so that you are slow by default and you pull the trigger to accellerate; I, personally, want to take it all in, not rush off.

I am not bothered about the comfort mode and prefer not to use it, but for those that get motion sickness, an option to change the size of the ""tunnel"" view to suit.

I for one, don't mind that you can't text-search for places to ""teleport"" to; searching adds to the enjoyment, but I'll expect a lot of people would prefer the option.

I know there's mirror mode, which you can modify to show just left/right eye as a circle on the screen, but for your friends to be able to view the experience full screen. I appreciate this could affect FPS etc, so just the option would be nice. 

Graphics settings, perhaps.

76561197970698176,291650,Unknown,40.516666666666666,,3,"Pillars of Eternity is an outstanding throwback to the golden age of RPGs, successfully blending rich storytelling, intricate world-building, and deep character customization. From the very first moments, you're immersed in a beautifully crafted world full of history, intrigue, and lore that feels alive and vibrant. The developers at Obsidian have clearly poured their hearts into creating a game that doesn’t just tell a story, but invites you to shape it through meaningful choices and engaging dialogue.

The combat system is a perfect mix of strategy and real-time action, offering a tactical challenge that feels rewarding. The diverse range of abilities and character builds ensures that no two playthroughs are the same. There's also a level of depth in how you interact with the world—everything from your party's backstories to the lore of the land is fleshed out and the consequences of your actions reverberate throughout the entire game.

The narrative in Pillars of Eternity is a true highlight. The game handles themes of life, death, reincarnation and the nature of the soul with nuance and sophistication while presenting a world that feels lived-in and grounded. The overarching story is truly gripping with rich dialogues making each interaction feel impactful.

Graphically, the game uses a beautiful,  hand drawn isometric art style that makes the world feel both timeless and distinct, reminiscent of old classic RPGs like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape: Torment. The environments are detailed, and the use of lighting and atmosphere brings the world to a higher level. Its art direction more than compensates for any technical shortcomings.

Overall, Pillars of Eternity is a must-play for fans of old school cRPGs, or anyone who loves a good story paired with a deeply immersive world. With a vast, intricate world to explore, tactical combat to master, and an engaging narrative that constantly rewards exploration, it’s a game that stands the test of time and remains one of my favorite RPGs of the last decade. | Masterpiece unfortunately hidden behind a slow and uninteresting start. Top notch world, characters, and story, with a mostly good real time with pause combat system behind it. This feels like the real spiritual successor to the Baldur's Gate games, unlike the actual BG3 which is more akin to a Dragon Age Origins. I played this directly after BG1 and was actually shocked at how faithful Pillars feels to those games. I'm gonna give this five big booms on the boom meter. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! | The world that Obsidian built is great, the main quest, the side-quests, everything ties in very well and feels like a cohesive piece of art.

Where the game fails a bit is the game-play. During combat it's hard to track what is happening, and even though I completed a game, I never felt confident and as if I mastered the game's mechanics. Something that is usually a reward itself in crpgs.
The art-style left a bit confused, on one side, the game is beautiful, on the other it was so hard for me to discern characters from the background, or even one character from the other. In many encounters I couldn't figure out where each companion stands, and I had to rely only on their avatars.
Also, the story deliver and a bunch of text, lore and hard-to-remember names made the game much harder to enjoy.

Once it all settles down in your mind, you can enjoy it more. I almost feel bad that I played this game now after the resurgence of crpgs, because I feel time-pressure to play all those games (Pathfinder, Deadfire, D:OS). If I played this game when it came out, I'm sure I would've played it at much slower pace and gave myself more time to learn all the mechanics and read every sentence that was written. But this is on me, nothing is stopping me to do this right now. | 游戏里rp死神嗣被贝拉斯讨债，游戏外在延伸白茫冻得倒欠3万字。

76561197970698176,359190,Unknown,0.0,,0,"I tentatively recommend this game.

It is a simple point-and-click puzzle game.

Interesting story, presented in a very simple way, with a few things hidden in corners that expand the details a bit. Nothing too obtuse or difficult to understand, beyond the basic part that requires a suspension of disbelief.

So the good is: I found it fun, the puzzles were interesting, kept me occupied for a few moments, but were not terribly difficult, so it was right in that range to quickly make me feel engaged in solving it, without ever being frustrating. The world building was simple, but effective, the audio was atmospheric, and I felt engaged in playing it the whole time.

At its core I would describe it as: minimalist, but it uses everything to its greatest potential, so while minimalist this also means no wasted space in the design and atmosphere.

The bad: I have played it through twice, with 100% achievement completion in one and a half hours, and that is just the  stats Steam gave me; I was not sitting and playing the whole time, and took my sweet time checking empty spaces and corners for secrets, so the actual gameplay time for playing it twice is under an hour.

There is also no replay value; once you know the puzzles, it takes just a few minutes to get from start to finish, and would take just one if not having to wait for animations and scenes. Once you get both endings there is nothing left for you, beyond getting 100%, and you are likely to get the few secrets and achievements on your way to the end anyway.

I only missed two myself. One because I went forward not realizing I couldn't go back, the other because it involved using a simple and obviously wrong way to try to solve a puzzle. The latter is easy to find when you look at the achievement list.

It is fun, but when you objectively compare it to the market, the game to cost ratio is kinda.. low on the game side. It would be very easy to get a lot more enjoyment for the same cost.

But that is the only hiccup, and while I feel $3 to $5 may be a more appropriate price, I don't actually regret purchasing and playing this.

So I tentatively recommend it. It's good, but be warned, for your $10, you will get about an hour of gameplay. | Using Steam's own terminology I would rate this ""Postive"". But just that. Not bad for a very limited dev team and fair for a sale price. But there's not a lot going on here and both my son and i found some of the puzzles tedious. I'd try something. Nope. Then literally every other thing possible. Then go look at a walk through video and - oh it was that first thing, but more of it. But beyond that, I like low poly games by small teams. It shows that a game is possible to make using more artistic flair than capital. I feel good supporting efforts like this. | Um jogo bem simples, quase uma apresentação de slide sobre uma única ideia, mas é uma ideia que pode fazer você pensar um pouco. | I'm really enjoying this one so far. The low-poly style and bizarre, dream-like quality of the environments mix well with the mystery of the story; it feels like I've been caught in a nightmare. Mechanics are simple point and click; you can mouselook with the right mouse button, and click on the white arrows shown in the screenshots to do a step-wise movement to the next square, like in some old-school RPGs. Puzzles are akin to standard point and click fare, with a very small inventory shown in the upper left of the screen; objects are moved onto the environment to use or each other to combine. | This game isn't bad by any means. It's just nothing special. 

GAMEPLAY: Click on-screen arrow buttons to move around like the adventure games of yore (think Myst), hold click and move mouse to look around. I'm not sure why this style was chosen, other than to perhaps give players a clearer indication as to where they should be going. But with as simplistic an art style as it has, combined with the ease of its puzzles and the games' short length, this isn't a necessary helping hand. It's not a detriment, nor is it a benefit either. You will primarly be walking around exploring, and otherwise, solving some simple puzzles (I'm hesitant to use that word, as it's mostly just plugging in items into the correct place). No combat to be had here.

VISUALS: Simple, cell-shaded, with lots of colour and fairly minimal detail. It looks nice, and again serves to highlight where you need to go.

AUDIO: Nothing to write home about. There's a general lack of music, no voice acting (aside from some background whispers at one point), and there's very little in the way of exciting events. You'll mostly be hearing footsteps and item uses.

STORY: There's a bit of a narrative to be uncovered here, which has an interesting premise (to do with man's relationship to nature, especially as it pertains to destructive elements) but it's not given much time to be fleshed out. Now I usually hate saying a game is too short, as it leads to games being too long (a much worse outcome), but this is a case where more time would have benefited the message it was trying to convey. Just as I thought I was beginning to see what it was trying to tell me, the game ended, and the connection I felt with its message was cut short. 

If you think the premise sounds neat or you want an hour and a half romp around some colourful environments, you could do worse than Rituals. I would advise picking it up on sale though, due to its length and lack of replay value.","Good, but not great."

[b]Spielzeit:[/b] ~5 Stunden (oder länger, wenn dein Chat dich leiden sehen will)  
[b]Empfohlen:[/b] Ja – aber nur, wenn du auf Twitch streamst und deinen Zuschauern vertraust.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Einleitung:[/h2]  
Willkommen bei [b]Choice Chamber[/b], dem Spiel, das dir zeigt, wie sehr dich dein Twitch-Chat hasst – oder liebt, aber meistens hasst. In diesem 2D-Plattformer hast du die Kontrolle… nein, Moment, das stimmt nicht. Dein Publikum hat die Kontrolle. Es entscheidet, ob deine nächste Waffe ein mächtiger Hammer oder eine langweilige Gummiente ist. Ob die Bühne mit Lava gefüllt ist oder so rutschig, dass du dich wie auf Butter fühlst. Klingt spaßig? Ist es – wenn du streamst. Andernfalls könnte es sein, dass dir schnell langweilig wird.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Das Spiel:[/h2]  
Choice Chamber kombiniert klassisches Hack-and-Slay-Gameplay mit einer einzigartigen Twitch-Integration. Als Streamer kannst du das Spiel mit deinem Kanal verbinden, und dein Chat wird in Echtzeit gefragt, wie sehr er dein Leben zur Hölle machen möchte. Die Entscheidungen sind vielfältig: Waffen, Gegner, Umgebungen – alles liegt in den Händen deiner Zuschauer.

Das Konzept? Genial. Die Umsetzung? Überraschend solide. Ob du deinen Chat dazu bringst, dich zu unterstützen, oder ihn einfach machen lässt, um zu sehen, wie grausam Menschen sein können, liegt bei dir. Ohne Twitch verliert das Spiel jedoch seinen Reiz, da die Manipulationsmöglichkeiten fehlen und du quasi allein in einer ziemlich bunten, aber leeren Kammer sitzt.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Das Gute:[/h2]  
[list]
[*][b]Twitch-Integration:[/b] Es gibt nichts Vergleichbares. Dein Publikum wird sich freuen, dich zu manipulieren, während du versuchst, dich am Leben zu halten.  
[*][b]Einfaches Spielprinzip:[/b] Die Steuerung ist intuitiv, und der Einstieg ist schnell – perfekt für kurze Streaming-Sessions.  
[*][b]Unendliche Dynamik:[/b] Kein Durchlauf gleicht dem anderen, wenn dein Chat die Macht hat.  
[/list]

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Das Schlechte:[/h2]  
[list]
[*][b]Ohne Twitch eher langweilig:[/b] Der größte Reiz des Spiels liegt in der Interaktion mit Zuschauern. Ohne diese fühlst du dich wie der einsame Gast auf einer Party.  
[*][b]Abhängigkeit vom Chat:[/b] Wenn dein Chat klein oder inaktiv ist, verliert das Spiel schnell seinen Charme.  
[*][b]Fehlende Tiefe:[/b] Für längere Solo-Sessions bietet Choice Chamber zu wenig Abwechslung.  
[/list]

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Für wen ist dieses Spiel geeignet?[/h2]  

[list]
[*][b]Streamende Helden:[/b] Wenn du einen aktiven Twitch-Kanal hast und deinem Publikum eine Show bieten willst, ist dieses Spiel perfekt.  
[*][b]Masochisten:[/b] Wer gerne leidet, wird die sadistischen Entscheidungen des Chats lieben.  
[*][b]Leute, die Chaos mögen:[/b] Dieses Spiel ist ein Paradebeispiel dafür, wie viel Chaos Menschen in ein Videospiel bringen können.  
[/list]

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Fazit: Der ultimative Twitch-Bonding-Test[/h2]  
[b]Choice Chamber[/b] ist ein einzigartiges Spiel, das besonders auf Twitch seine wahre Stärke zeigt. Die Interaktion zwischen Spieler und Chat ist der Kern des Spiels, und es gibt kaum etwas Vergleichbares auf dem Markt. Die bunten Level und das einfache Gameplay machen es ideal für Streaming-Sessions, während die Macht des Publikums für unvorhersehbare, oft witzige Momente sorgt.

Ohne Twitch verliert das Spiel jedoch viel von seinem Charme. Wenn du nicht streamst, gibt es wenig, das dich bei der Stange hält. Aber hey, das ist kein Fehler – es ist ein Feature.

[b]Bewertung:[/b]  
[b]7 von 10 Gummienten.[/b] Zwei Punkte Abzug für die Abhängigkeit von Twitch und einen weiteren für die fehlende Tiefe im Solo-Modus – aber alles andere ist pure Streaming-Magie.

Dann freue ich mich, wenn du meinem [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33163055-HeikarGaming/]Steam-Kuratorenprofil HeikarGaming[/url] folgst und weitere Spielempfehlungen entdeckst! | Choice Chamber is the best game for Twitch Streamers who want their viewers involved in game play (viewers type words to give you a buddy, hearts, exploding bombs to break through blocks, platforms to get past the bed of lava, give you a sword, bow, lasers etc to help you battle those monsters and bosses - so much options to help or not help you to the next room) . If you enable the feature in the game for subscribers they pop up in a chest when they re-sub and help you in the game too which is awesome.  I played this game yesterday just over 3 hours for the first time and I loved it.  It did not take long to get hang of Choice Chamber and by the end of my stream my hands had a good workout with the controller.  My viewers typed words constantly and they really enjoyed taking part in helping me beat my room score.  It is nice that my viewers can be helpful or not (be a little bit evil ha ha and make the rooms more difficult for me).  

The graphics are cute and colourful.

The music is catchy and matches this type of game really well.  

I will certainly play this game more with my viewers.  There was nobody available for online play so I could not play against others but  it is still enjoyable nevertheless.  Offline play I have not tried either so I cannot comment on that.

I do not have any cons about this game but only improvement recommendations - I would like this game to have video and sound settings in the menu.  The game  is displayed in windowed mode which can be maximised (full screen windowed borderless would be a nice feature).  I could not use game capture like I normally do in obs studio only window capture because of the lack of video settings in the game.  I had to lower the volume of my game to 2% in windows 10 sound mixer  as it was too loud for my viewers - I would prefer to do that in the game  - if the game had sound settings to change the music and SFX volumes etc. this would resolve my issue.  My thumbs got tired spamming the buttons for attacking and an automatic attack/fire button would help greatly in this wonderful game.

Work those fingers and thumbs to the bone as Choice Chamber is totally worth a buy. | Absulut eine Geile idee

이 게임은 단순히 아래로 내려가기만 하면 되는 게임입니다. 다만, 내려가는 길이 결코 순탄치 않다는 게 문제죠. 플레이어가 할 수 있는 것은 이동과 점프(총)뿐입니다. 계속해서 아래로 내려가면서 몬스터의 머리를 밟거나 터트리고, 젬을 모아 무기를 업그레이드한 뒤 다시 아래로 내려가는 방식입니다.

스테이지는 총 4개로 구성되어 있으며, 마지막 스테이지에서는 보스전이 펼쳐집니다. 사실 단순히 내려가기만 하면 된다고 했지만, 마지막 보스를 상대하려면 어느 정도 업그레이드를 해두는 것이 정신 건강에 좋습니다. 플레이 도중 얻는 젬을 활용해 공격 횟수를 증가시키거나 체력을 회복하고 강화할 수 있습니다. 또한, 스테이지가 끝날 때마다 새로운 능력을 하나씩 선택할 수 있습니다.

게임의 그래픽과 색감은 다소 단조롭지만, 빠른 속도감과 뛰어난 타격감, 훌륭한 사운드가 이를 보완합니다. 공중에서 떨어지는 짧은 순간 동안 최적의 플레이를 고민하고 실행해야 하는, 단순하면서도 어렵고 그만큼 재미있는 게임이었습니다.

참고로, 이런 세로구조 게임은 모바일 환경에 더 적합하다고 생각할 수도 있지만, 사실 이 게임은 스팀 출시 이전에 이미 모바일로 먼저 나온 작품입니다. 저도 예전에 모바일 버전으로 즐겼던 기억이 있어서 그때 스팀에서 구매해두고 묵혀둔거였는데, 다시 찾아보니 현재 모바일 버전은 유료로 바뀌었네요. 예전에는 무료였던 것 같은데 말이죠. | 3.75个币的街机小游戏

76561197970698176,362890,Unknown,8.366666666666667,,0,"After 8 years collecting dust in my library, I finally managed to play this masterpiece.
While the first part of the game is a meticulously crafted remake of the original [i]Half-Life[/i], with the Xen chapter they truly made it their own game. Pushing the Source engine to its absolute limits, life on Xen has never been this beautiful. It brings some of the HL2 feeling to the original game and expands on the lore for a much more complete and fleshed-out end game experience. Finishing this game actually brings significance to G-Man's words and makes it feel like an actual achievement.
Just be aware that this game has some soul-rending completionist achievements on hand that make you question your life choices if you decide to get them The Real Way™ and some technical issues on Linux that are better documented on ProtonDB.
Though this didn't affect my enjoyment of the game and would still highly recommend it as a way to relive Half-Life in a modern way, without even speaking of the great Workshop additions people have come up with and multiplayer support this game brings to the table. | Наконец-то руки добрались до этого шедевра, уж очень понравилось)) 
Я больше фанат двойки, а первый HALF LIFE играл очень давно, во времена динозавров на пиратке, и тут BLACK MESA ремейк первой части от сторонних разрабов, игра 2 года находилась у меня не пройденной в библиотеке, в итоге я ее прошел и не пожалел. 

Очень понравился визуал, все выглядит очень бодро, а в моментах через чур красиво, что просто останавливаешься и по минут 15 не двигаешься и залипаешь красивыми видами, на столько хорошо поработали над картинкой.
Геймплей типичный для халвы, я бы сказал, что от второй части отличие только оружие, тут его побольше и сделано красиво, плавные анимации приятные глазу, стрельба не уровня COD 2019, но достойная.
Игра хорошо оптимизирована, у меня не было не багов, не просадок. 

Видел люди жалуются на вылеты, просадки, долгую загрузку карт по 15 минут, вообще из этого ничего не было. А у меня то еще палеозойское чучело, которое потянуло эту игру на почти максималках, как по мне тут даже карты грузились побыстрее чем во второй части. Некоторые вообще думают, что карты из gmod'а, серьезно ? Играл на многих картах, даже самые качественные карты и рядом не стоят с картами из Black Mesa. ""В игре очень темно, я чего это в хорор играю, а разрабы?"", да это в первую очередь шутер, но и хорор тоже, людей не смущает что вообще в игре происходит, а происходит откровенное мясо, везде трупы и зомбари вместе с пришельцами, темные моменты наоборот нагоняет жути как и должно быть.

[b]ЗЕН[/b] - Очень красиво воссоздали Зен, прям ну конфетка, казалось бы все окей, но есть одно но, и в этом я уже соглашусь с большей частью мнений, мир Зен в первой части half life, был ну буквально на 30 минут или чуть больше и состоял он из летающих островков и все, разработчики Мезы сделали Зен со своей флорой и фауной, куда не глянь кто-то на кого-то охотится, кто-то кого-то жрет, и визуально прям ну очень красиво и опасно одновременно. Понравилось как показали вертигонтов уже с другой стороны и здесь более ясно, что их поработили, то как они занимаются разработкой суперсолдат из себя же блин, было жаль их, и тут им я даже как то сочувствовал, чего не было в оригинале.
Но... но есть одно но, зен ну очень растянут, прям до нельзя, тут и правда были моменты когда хотелось ливнуть и снести  игру к чертям, то ты прыгаешь по всяким платформам, то ты прыгаешь по платформам и там уже враги, то там уже прыгаешь и уворачиваешься от лазеров и убиваешь противников, и так блин почти час или больше, вот тут уже прям жирнющий минус в сторону Зена. Но это был основной и один минус как по мне, все остальное прям на высоте и круто, а то, что это сделали по факту фанаты с таким качеством, вот он пример, как нужно делать ремейки, да Rockstar? 

Black Mesa - Красивая и проработанная игра, видно, что разработчики уважают вселенную Half life, к тому это пример того как нужно делать игры. 12 из 10 | I was honestly not expecting to dislike this as much as I did, as Half-Life is one of my favorite games of all time. I went into Black Mesa expecting just a nice graphical face lift, and instead experienced change after change that I feel genuinely fell short of the still unmatched experience that is Half-Life. 

Movement and gunplay immediately felt off to me. While I understand the game does not run on the same engine as the original, the intrinsic feel of movement and weapon firing was something I didn't realize was so well done in Half-Life until playing Black Mesa. Weapons lack the punch and “character” that made them all so satisfying to use. This is made glaringly clear by the game's sound design, which is passable but outright pales in comparison to Half-Life 1. 

Combat also feels strange. Enemy AI seems to always have perfect aim while moving, resulting in the player resorting to quick peeks from cover to preserve health and shields. This was super unfun compared to the ability to run-and-gun and think on the fly in the original. Combat itself felt like a puzzle in the original Half-Life, but it feels more like a generic shooter in Black Mesa.

While I found the soundtrack on its own to be well composed and enjoyable, it didn't fit the tone and mood of Half-Life at all. The industrial rock and techno edges are gone. Instead, more generic action/cinematic songs take its place. I'd argue that Half-Life's soundtrack is vital to setting its tone, so this was a real sore spot for me. I get that they most likely couldn't just re-use the same OST, but it felt like there wasn't any significant attempt to recreate that industrial sound that permeates the cold, chromatic halls of the Black Mesa facility.

As many others have noted, Xen is a real slog. I enjoyed how it started and appreciated it's differences in level design, but I didn't care for the more Avatar-esque interpretation of the border world. The original Xen had an almost HR Giger feel to it that, like the tone of the OST, was completely stripped away. The second to last chapter falls apart into the most mind numbingly rudimentary “final level,” which grossly overstays its welcome and almost makes you forget what game you're playing. The long-winded and bloated design choices are baffling here, especially considering the fact that On A Rail was totally gutted for pacing reasons, apparently. While Xen in the original was ultimately nothing to write home about, it served its purpose succinctly and still capped off the game neatly and without making me feel utterly checked out and exhausted.

Black Mesa was ultimately a very odd game for me. It ended up in a sort of no man's land, where it simultaneously tried to stay true to the source material while also trying to dramatically change things in order to differentiate itself from its source material. The result is a game that, while STILL an impressive project despite my dislike for many of its elements, could never escape comparisons to Half-Life, and the constant feeling that this remake didn't offer an experience anywhere near improved over the original. 

I know I'm being really critical here, but I don't think Black Mesa is a terrible game nor do I think it's not worth experiencing. What I am saying is that Black Mesa should not be considered a replacement for the original Half-Life 1 in any way, shape, or form. It is best played at some point after completing the original and its subsequent expansions (well, at least just Opposing Force). But as it stands, the best way to experience Half-Life is still, unquestionably, by playing Half-Life. | It's an incredible achievement all around.  They recreated the mood and vibe of Half Life, while adding in more character and depth. The environments make more sense, and connect to each other in a more coherent way, the introductions of enemies is much more artful, and the voice acting and dialogue is really well done which is  so rare for community projects.
Half Life 1 may be a masterpiece of it's time and it's worth giving it a go, but this can easily stand in as a replacement as many of the original innovations of Half Life 1 are now commonplace in most shooters. The atmosphere and tone is so well realised that it feels as if the Half Life 2 developers made it themselves.
Possibly the best community made game in history, certainly the best community made mod in history.
Play it. | [h1] Грандиозный ремонт [/h1]

Первой Half-Life почти 30 лет. Даже несмотря на мою любовь к старине, играть в неё уже крайне проблематично. А для тех, кому привычна и другая картинка, и осознание, что игра старше игрока - тут уж совсем тяжко. Black Mesa выросла из мода. Взять движок Half-Life 2, который и сейчас смотрится весь приятно, и переставить первую часть на вторую. Только с огромным количеством улучшений, на разработку которых потратили 15 лет.

Довольно долгая сюжетная кампания, где шутер частенько отходит на второй план. Головоломками этот игровой процесс с трудом можно назвать. Скорее, внимательно смотреть надо, куда прыгаешь и забираешься. Есть даже пара уровней, где в основном игрок именно этим и занимается, стреляя крайне редко. Но и стрельба тут очень приятная, а борьба с противниками интересная. Да, противники нередко пытаются задавить Вас мясом, но и часто используют укрытия, бросают гранаты или пытаются откуда-нибудь подальше атаковать, чтобы игрок не сразу смог ответить. Арсенал достаточно внушительный, каждое оружие требует своего подхода и многие орудия имеют альтернативный режим стрельбы. 

Ну и отдельного восхищения заслуживает мир Зен. Невероятная красота! Большие и интересные уровни, на которых, опять-таки, перемешаны и шутер, и ""головоломки"". Правда, последнее на Зене может слегка утомить - слишком, пожалуй, долго придётся карабкаться и прыгать.

В игре есть как и сюжетный режим, так и мультиплеер, да ещё и своя мастерская.

The game has a pretty steep learning curve, does not hold your hand, or offer much in the form of guidance.  But it is oh so rewarding when you do get the hang of it and are able to take on the more challenging battles the game has to offer.

-Go into the first town that has strangled trade routes, has been raided recently, and is somehow inhabited by exclusively anti-sellsword activists
-Get your first contract
-Get decapitated by a graverobber high on hyena acid

Like M&B, I had fun for awhile, until i realized that there is nothing tactical about the game and every battle becomes pretty repetitive. The game starts every battle with your sides in two lines within almost one turns movement distance. Very tactical. I know I would deploy my guys right up there within range of archers. The terrain for each battle is generated upon entering the battle, so you may start the battle with your back against a hill. Did my guys march right down a hill and start battle at the foot of the hill my enemies are on. Very Tactical. The game kind of treats armor and shields as a second health bar, so it just becomes swinging attrition. The only bonus you get for placement of troops is a mild accuracy bonus. Mild. So you surround a guy with a shield and he somehow blocks every swing with a shield until the shield is destroyed. Then do the same for armor. Tactical as hell. Yes some weapons deal more damage to shields or armor, but ultimately it is still a very shallow ""tactical"" experience. | Fun Game! Challenging, with a learning curve to it. Not crazy though.

It has a few flaws: Firstly, notes taking up RAM, let alone a lot of RAM.

76561197970698176,365670,Unknown,3.0833333333333335,,0,"Ok I think I've got enough experience with this program to write a decent review on it...

     Blender has had a notorious reputation, at least in my experience, with being a difficult program to learn. I agree. For someone who has never touched a 3D/CG program I cannot reccommend enough that you don't chose blender. It is difficult to catch on just because of the shear amount of things packed into it. It has made improvements, big improvements in my opinion since I first used it, it can still be a challenge to navigate and understand. If you have dabbled in 3D/CG software before, this will still have a bit of a big learning curve and some things to get used to, *cough* right-click *cough**cough*. Like I mentioned before it can be a bit confusing just because theres a lot you can do with it.
     All that being said if you choose to stick around, if you choose to take the time to learn this, either on your own(via youtube, etc.) or paying for lessons (CG Cookie, etc.), if you choose to deal with the initial frustration that may accompany learning this program (some people might be frustrated longer than others it all depends), then you will have access to one of the most powerful CG Creation Suites in terms of what it can do, and how much it costs(free by the way). If you want to take it on I'd recommend sticking to only one feature, like 3D modeling. Focus on learning that before you start trying to learn animation or compositing (Thats not the trick that's just how I went about it.) When you get familiar enough with it everything else sort of falls together. Now lets get down to buisness...

Pros:
-Can do a lot
 -3D Modeling
 -Animating
 -Compositing
 -Video Editing
 -2D Animation (Grease Pencil)
 -Sculpting
 -3D Painting
 -Game Creation (BGE)
  -Python Scripting
 -Capable of photorealism
 -Add-ons (Free and paid)
  -can optimize some aspects of blender bringing it close to some professional program equivalent
 -Pretty big community willing to help out
  -youtube tutorials
  -Paid course tutorials (CG Cookie, Blender Guru, etc.)
  -Community Forums
  -just google it =P

Cons:
 - A lot to learn in one suite
  - Not for the faint of heart
  - Nor for the short of patience
  - Don't expect to learn this overnight
 - Right-clicking, not huge but can take a bit to get used to
 - because there's so much you can do in blender, when asking the community anywhere a question you need to be 
    specific (ie., ""I wanna know how to make my flower look like this one."" Like in the compositor, materials, textures, etc. 
                  not a very good example but meh.)
- Blender is generalized not specialized/optimised 
 -In other words comparing its Sculpting to something like Zbrush you'll see some stark contrasts
 -Same holds true with some of its other features
  -Personally, though, I think its animation (rigging, weight painting, animating) is better than Maya but that's me.
- Blender Game Engine (BGE) is real nice and you can make some impressive things, however it does fall short when you compare it to other game engines like Unity or Unreal
  
Personal experience with this is I was first exposed to blender when I was 12 in 2006 I dabbled in it and was really confused what was happening eventually after a few days I just gave up. I didn't feel I was making any progress let alone know what I was doing. I didn't touch it again until nearing the end of my sophomore year in college since then I got more involved with it. When I found out it came on steam I was already in 2nd semester Junior year so what you see are hours after I found it here I've had a longer time with this than what you see. Prior to this I was taking classes that taught 3DS Max, Maya, Zbrush, and Mudbox. Blender was self-taught (not counting CG Cookie).

All That being said I'm sure I might have missed some things but I hoped I explained enough to answer most questions on this. | Super logiciel de 3D , il est surtout bien pour débuter , car si on se lance directement dans des logiciels telle que MAYA ou 3DS MAX on est un peu pommé ^^. 
Par rapport à d'autre logiciel comme 3DS MAX il est gratuit et open source ET EN PLUS il prend beaucoup moins de place sur disque dûr , celui ci fait quelque mega , alors que 3DS MAX fait quelques giga.
Il est très simple à utiliser , il y a plein de plugin de base , il peut être utiliser pour plein de chose (impression 3d , effet spéciaux , jeux vidéo , skin ... etc) et il est parfait pour une personne qui ne vas s'en servir qu'une ou deux fois dans sa vie .
Par contre si vous utilisez souvent des outils 3D , utiliser plutôt 3DS MAX , c'est plus intéressant pour vous . | 1 июня 2018 :Чтож, ставится на дебиане без малейшего нарекания.5+
5 февраля 2017 :В этой программе невероятно много функций и возможностей, что приходится ограждать себя от ""лишнего""...Да, для некоторых задачь остались более удобные способы решения, нежели в блендере.Но тут собрано всё и сразу, постарались сделать интерфейсы однотипными и логично выполнеными, быстрое переключение между задачами, лёгкая интеграция элементов выполненая другим человеком, вообщем коммандная, простая и достаточно лёгкая в освоении программа. Просто 10/10 и SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY ...АХ ДА! она бесплатная О_О... FREE, KARL!... Но желание комманде разработчиков подкинуть валюты, только прибавляется.

P.S: пойду дальше зубрить ^^ | Blender, un nome una garanzia. Semplicemente fantastico, altamente personalizzabile e molto potente. Inutile dire quanto siano sbagliate le recensioni negative che riguardano la sua difficoltà d'uso, il software a primo impatto fa questa impressione che con pazienza e soprattutto esercitazione si riesce a superare(come tutti i programmi di modellazione,editing ecc). Consiglio a tutti Blender. | It may only be 60mb, but what you can do with it is incredible. Certain software houses throw gigabytes at you, but Blender still competes.

Story 8,5/10.
-time to completed was managable
-the plot twist caught me off guard
-we can choose routes (for the sake of ending we want)
-NPC quite dynamic (could affect the story a little)

Music solid 9/10
-matched every situation
-made me had this deep connection to the story and the journey

Quest 9/10
-TON OF QUESTS
-literally u could slain everything and still have other quest to do
-u can FAILED to do something and cant retake the quest until NG+ (and it would affect the story. I really like it)
-but the escort quest sucks

Exploration 10/10
-HUGE MAP
-open world
-for me to completed 1 playthrough (did main quest and side quests) and light up the whole map (only Gransys) without fast travel etc, need around 80 hours (im quite chill guy when explore something)
-there are various type of enemy and material. u can't get bored out of it
-even after 150 hours and NG+, im still not done yet. I STILL EXPLORING until i know every corner of this game

Battle mechanism 10/10
-SO MUCH skillset to try
-We can mix and match the skill we need every situation
-VOCATION SYSTEM WAS PERFECT. we can try different role and abilities
-Pawn could help us in the field we lacking (like healer/tank/DPS)
-Cool looking weapon (and have so much type)
-we can climb up the monster, so melee type vocation not gonna suffered a lot. lol

The game itself was not hard, more like challenging in a good way. but every enemy has different pattern, resistence, ability, size, speed, etc. So we need to work our brain out to survive. On the Gransys Map, we could easily win every enemy encountered, with a few exceptional. But SPOILER ALERT: on Bitterblack Isle, better prepared bcs the big guys can one-shot us lol.

The only minus was graphic, i mean this was AN OLD GAME. 1st time released in 2012 (its been 13 years), and the DARK ARISEN released in 2016. So the graphic was outdated. But that was not really a minus for me. I mean, i can feel the dynamic of every law in this game. Like the movement of the animal, the interaction between NPC, the pattern of monsters, the movement of water/wind, changing of weather, the movement of my robe when i walk or run or got drenched, etc. So an old school graphic was not a setback for me. 

At the end, this is a really SOLID GAME, even in the 2024/2025 or sometimes in the future.

Hollow Knight is a game that truly embodies the spirit of adventure and discovery. Its [b]smooth and non-linear gameplay[/b] offers players the freedom to explore at their own pace, uncovering multiple side-quests and hidden paths. Every moment spent in the world of Hallownest feels deliberate, as the game masterfully rewards exploration with meaningful upgrades and utilities like charms, keeping you hooked as you uncover its many secrets.
[h2][b]The worldbuilding:[/b][/h2]
It's one of the game's standout features. Hallownest is a place teeming with history, packed with secrets that not only reward the player mechanically but also deepen their understanding of a kingdom that was once prosperous but has since fallen into ruin. The [b]art style[/b] is breathtakingly unique, conveying an emotional story through its hauntingly beautiful environments and designs. It’s not just a backdrop—it’s part of the narrative, pulling you into the melancholic beauty of the world.
[h2][b]The NPCs:[/b][/h2]
They are memorable and fully fleshed out, each with their own personalities and backstories. They add depth and life to the world, making every interaction meaningful.
[h2][b]The bosses:[/b][/h2]
 Both challenging and diverse, with a wide variety of encounters, including optional fights for those who seek an even greater test of skill.
[h2][b]The Story:[/b][/h2]
Getting lost in Hallownest is more than just a challenge—it’s an adventure. Every corner of the map holds something exciting or rewarding, and the game's design encourages curiosity. The combination of its stunning art style, intricate world, and rewarding exploration makes Hollow Knight a standout title in the Metroidvania genre.
Whether you’re in it for the challenge, the story, or the thrill of exploration, Hollow Knight delivers on all fronts. It’s a game that doesn’t just tell a story—it lets you live it.

I skipped it on release, because I didn't like the second game, but now I decided that I need to give it a chance.
It is same Gothic game, excluding the fact that now we go everywhere with immortal companions and instead of a huge open world there are 7 big maps(maybe more, I didn't complete the game yet).
Cons for me: 
- it is much easier to survive when you have a companion. However I always can leave companions on a vessel, I believe it won't work. 
- the weird skill system, it is not clear how it is working now. For example there is a skill that reduces merchant prices, it says that each skill level reduces it on 5%. Maximum is 3 levels. I've got the 2nd level and the price drop was almost 50%. Maybe it depends from attributes, but this skill depends from 2 attributes.
- damned markers on a map, but thanks got you can just don't select a task in the task list menu.

Unfortunately, the game itself is too random, has obvious bugs like ramps not being loaded, making levels impossible, has almost no explanations and too many instant death traps. I could not get past Level A-5 which is a pity as the survival mode only gets unlocked after A-8 which I was looking forward to. I could not get enough stars to even buy one single item. (As a matter of fact I barely managed to find the shop screen at all after I already lost hope and desperately tried to find settings or key bindings which I might have overlooked) The graphics are appealing, though they are not refined enough to qualify the view as a pleasure. The menus are not user friendly.

Please fix the randomness. Make sure, all blocks and ramps are loaded and the camera does not reset itself. Add some explanations or make the tutorial levels clear enough to learn what is needed to play. Maybe make the map rotating instead of always facing north. Ditch the timer running out.

I really enjoyed this one, but can't recommend it due to a couple of very big flaws.  If it weren't for the camera tracking issues and the fact that the game was left unfinished, this would have been one of my favorite VR titles.  Fixing just one of those would probably be enough to bump it up to a ""recommended"" rating.

Another big reason to not recommend this title is that it is a near duplicate of the original, Final Approach.  It comes down to this:
[list]
[*]Do you need to buy this game if you already have Final Approach? No.
[*]Should you buy this instead of Final Approach if you have neither? I would lean towards the original Final Approach, but it depends on the gameplay style you want to experience. (more on that below)
[*]Is it worth playing if you got it bundled for free with Final Approach? Sure
[/list]
On paper, the game is just about landing planes, but it's made quite broad with the unique locations, mini-games, mission variety, quality visuals and lively voice acting.

[/td]
[/tr]
[/table]

[h1]How's this different from Final Approach?[/h1]

Final Approach: Pilot Edition (FA:PE) is an exact copy of Final Approach (FA) with only a couple of key differences in how they are played:
[list]
[*]In FA you play the game standing above an airfield, and land planes by mapping out flight paths with your VR wands. 
[*]In FA:PE you sit in a chair, landing planes by taking direct control of them and flying them via 3rd person view.  Everything is done via your gamepad.  Your VR wands aren't used at all in FA:PE except to start or exit the game.
[/list]
That's basically it.  Otherwise, the missions, story,  graphics, etc. is all the same.

FA:PE and the original FA are both fun, and they feel like different experiences, despite being essentially the same game.  If you get it bundled with FA, that's great.  It's a fun twist on the original.  However if you gotta pick one, I have to go with FA.  Its the experience that the software is designed for.  And since the games are so similar you really don't need to buy this one too unless you enjoyed the original enough to want to play it again from a different angle.

[h1]Camera Tracking[/h1]

Now, let's address the elephant in the room, because it's an understandable deal-breaker for some people.  The camera (your VR display) follows, but does not track the aircraft you control.  I'll give you an example to illustrate.  Let's say you are flying a plane you selected.  As long as that plane flies straight, you are right there with it, following in third person.  However, if you turn that plane, you need to turn your chair to keep that aircraft in the center of your vision, otherwise it flies out of your view.  Doing a 180 with your aircraft requires you to do a 180 with your chair.  Yeah, its a little weird, and probably not their preferred design.  I'm guessing they had a choice between rebuilding FA:PE from the ground up (to make it a true 3rd person experience) or simply use 95% of the code already written for FA, with some minor adjustments to make FA:PE possible, and they decided to go with the latter.

Fortunately, a button on your gamepad can be pressed to re-center the plane in your vision.  In practice, this means that every time you are turning an aircraft you are pressing that ""re-center"" button a few times in a single turn so that you can play the game sitting still without spinning your chair.  Yes, it's a hacky mechanism, but I was able to get accustomed to it and still enjoy the game.

For some people, this is a deal-breaker.  It's nauseating to some, and I can see why.  For me, my tolerance for spinning and motion in VR is probably medium.  I'm not the strongest nor am I the weakest for that kind of stuff.  I was able to adjust and play for long periods of time without issue.

It's important to note that this issue only affects FA:PE, because in FA, planes are not flown in 3rd person, they are merely guided like an air traffic controller.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

As far as gameplay is concerned it's really a great balance of difficulty and fun.  Reading the description, a game that's primarily based on landing and launching planes may not sound that great, but it actually is.  It can get quite hectic with all the things going on at once: aircraft waiting to take off, engine fires that need to be put out, birds on the runway, aircraft in the air with low fuel wanting to land.  There are tons of aircraft to control and each one behaves slightly different in terms of speed and maneuverability, but the learning curve for getting it down is still pretty small.  It's meant to be fun, not a simulation.  They did fantastic with the core gameplay.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2956807534

While semi-cartoony, it is still excellent visually.  You'll find yourself leaning forward occasionally to take a close at all the tiny little details.

Each of the 4 locations has a different feel, unique obstacles and different built-in minigames:
[list]
[*] Parrot Island is a simple, laid-back airport and a good place to learn the basics.
[*] Metro Airport is busy and requires extra effort to avoid collisions on the ground.
[*] Metro City requires maneuvering around buildings, mainly focusing on helicopters and stunt planes.
[*] Midway is all military aircraft and aircraft carriers.  It even includes some combat. (which is more fun in FA:PE than in FA)
[/list]

Each mini-game is wildly different, from sorting luggage to manning an anti-aircraft gun on a cruiser.  It highlights the considerable effort in making this game as broad as possible.  The variety ensures nothing gets too repetitive.

There's a story that's with you the whole way.  It's not too in depth, but it's adequate to frame the purpose of each of the 15 missions.  Besides the story missions there are challenge missions, and they are definitely more intense.  Most of those require multi-tasking and quick reactions. 

Switching between aircraft and taking control of an aircraft is fluid.  Everything you need to do can be done from a standard PS or XBox gamepad.  

[h1]Achievements and Completion Time[/h1]

My other big gripe about this game is that even though it's not in ""early access"" it is not yet complete.  To be clear, it is complete mechanically and functionally.  It's playable, and relatively bug free, but the final levels were never released.  Levels 16 and 17 are locked, and are shown as ""coming soon"".  It's been 6 years since the last update from the devs, so it's safe to say that it will likely remain this way for eternity.  What makes matters worse is that there are achievements tied to these locked levels.  So achievement hunters be warned, it is not possible to 100% this game.  If they couldn't commit to finishing the last two levels, that's understandable, but at least roll back the code to only be 15 levels so the achievements aren't eternally stuck.  Leaving a game hanging like that really grinds my gears.

In order to complete all the currently released story levels, challenge levels, and earn 91% achievements (the rest are bugged or dependent on unplayable levels), I logged about 20 hours in the game.  You could easily get through it under half that time though.  I spent a bunch of extra time replaying levels, attempting to climb the leaderboards.

[quote]Follow [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41449676/]Summit Reviews[/url] for more high-quality reviews.[/quote] | Seeing other reviews I see I'm an exception, but honestly I liked the Pilot Edition more than the standard one. I bought Final Approach just when launched, at the very early days of Vive avaliability, and yes it was cool but wasn't very impressed of the gameplay itself. The game suffered also of awful performances with lot of missed frames, and I refunded.

I'm back today after more than a year, with the Pilot Edition (than include also the standard, if you buy this one you'll get both). I tried the classic version again, the graphics is way more detailed and super smooth, they made an exceptional work in optimizations but still I don't find particulary fun or compelling the gameplay. With my surprise, the Pilot Edition instead fit way more my taste.

Where those games are almost identical in contents, the classic version use full roomscale, handtracking and is based on drawing paths in the air: let's say than is closer to play with toys on a tabletop airport. The Pilot Edition instead is a seated + pad experience, something less interesting in theory, but well... now you pilot airplanes with a sweet third person view! It's like a Pilotwings kind of game mixed with managerial elements. Birds and fires are still present, but their weight is reduced, and this also is a good news being both actions repetitive and annoying to perform.

I realize than the classical Final Approach was (and still is) a more peculiar and roomscale oriented project, but the Pilot Edition as pure videogame is a better product.



 | There is only 1 camera option - following the airplane and it's only barely playable at best. Phaser Lock Interactive, please add more camera views, for example: First Person View, Proper Third Person View, Topdown View and so on. | The thing to remember first about Pilot Edition, it exists to capture VR players without motion controlls. The reason I bring that up is you will find a lot of the same tricks\modes of the original Final Approach. Stuff like Bird Clearing, queing planes for takeoff, fire duty.  

But the real core of this game is all about flying. The first ouple campaign/tutorial levels will seem awfully familiar to FA owners. But this is saved by how cool flying is. Even from 3rd person its really great to be controlling this 3d model, and it deals with aero dynamics pretty well, so don't start a straight down dive figuring you can pull up at the last second, you will die.Same goes for slowing down too much . I was reaching for a ballon on a really steep climb in plane not designed for that and the engine started to stall .  Just stuff like that makes it a completely new dimension to the game.

Its one of the best put togather VR games around right now. If I was a rift owner I'd buy this for sure,  I ended up playing about 40 mins on my first go and the time just flew by, the only reason I quit was I had caused  a two 747 looking planes to collide/explode on the runway at that big airport where it's all airlines.  Otherwise I'd probably still be playing/

For Vive owners it really is best to think of this as  just anoher part of a whole larger game, say Final Approach: Definative Edition.    

Over  I'd say I still like the room scale version a bit more. but this isn't half bad and well worth the time | Not for the weak of stomach... My first time flying ended disasterously, plane after plane would get lost or crash in any attempt to even land would end in fiery death, that is if I could even find where the runway was. I found it jarring that any time I wanted to steer, the plane would fly out of my view, the camera does not follow, and the only way to adjust the plane back into view was to hit the left bumper of my controller. Suffice to say that any turn was nearly impossible to follow and that hitting the bumper only made me confused as to what new direction I was heading, ( some sort of indicator hud as to where the landing zones are would have been greatly helpful in that situation). At this point it was unplayable as I could not even get past the tutorial level... However on my second attempt I found out the much needed accessory that was crucial to playing this game, a swivel chair! Yes, rotating my physical view allowed me to keep the plane in sight while it turned. So simple and yet completely flew right over my head. Once discovering that little tid-bit I got quite good at handling the plane, putting out fires, and tending to the seagulls. However...I was ill-prepared for the nasuea I would feel. Slowly but surely it ate away at my tolerance level (which to be fair isn't that high) until I had to just close my eyes and take off the headset. For those gifted with iron inner-ears(?) this is a pretty fun version of the roomscale one, but I cannot personally recommend it.","I really enjoyed this one, but can't recommend it due to a couple of very big flaws.

- Randy Pitchford is still in charge

I mean, the gameplay is kinda fun, I liked the mechanics of managing the money and inventory and the little develop your character gets depending on certain iterations, but I felt really anxious with the fast clock goes and the routes having to be discovered by pure chance... I mean, for instance, I was really wanting to go through Copenhagen, Warsaw, etc, but the routes were hidden and I had to spend +4 hours in a location I really didn't want to explore more... because, first of all, it was supposed to be just a quick stop to bank and market and than procceed, much because the clock running fast, as I previously mentioned, and the game forced me to spend more time and I didn't get in reward what I wanted or expected...

But I recommend buying this game only on sale because 20€ for 2 hour story is just too much. | Even though it is technically made by different studio, Abzu cannot avoid being compared to Journey. What's more, Journey art director and composer worked on it. Sadly, it seems inferior in most aspects. That is not to say soundtrack is bad, or it does not look good, on the contrary, ocean fish and plants are more beautiful than in most other games, you even interact with fish and can ride them. But where is a fish, there is a catch.

Some scenes and overall plot have almost one to one correspondence with Journey. It's like they used the same idea board for this game. It's the same simple puzzles solving or activating switches, even story is presented in a similar manner. But Journey was more mysterious, I was constantly wondering, what would come next and what it all was about. Here, it's mostly more ocean, different kind, but still ocean. Somehow, empty desert felt more alive than water with all the fish around. Where the Journey was about movement, Abzu is about stillness, meditation, observation.

Controlling character in 3d is way more complicated than walking on a sand and I spent a bit too much effort navigating around to appreciate the sights. Journey also had flying mechanics, but they felt more like usual game jumps. I needed to search for small crevices or buttons or holes in ground but I'd rather swim with fish and appreciate the beauty.

No gameplay element is done better than Journey, although the last seemed more minimalistic in nature. Where Journey felt like living through different stages of life, here it's a more of a sidequest to fix several pipes to bring life back to oceans. Sure, the message is correct, but the emotional struggle is not quite there.

Also, there is no coop at all, one of the biggest surprises and unique mechanics that is not replicated much anywhere else to this day after Journey. But there is no such thing here, which makes you wonder, does anyone care? Is anyone around any more?

Abzu feels like a prequel rather than a sequel and is so heavily inspired that does not bring enough new things. It's all about water. There is even underwater water. And that's what it is: a nice journey with too much water. | I've never loved a game more, it's thrilling and calming all at once.

[td]
• The unique approach to skills and progression, based on items rather than ability trees, grants a high degree of build flexibility while keeping gameplay fresh.

• Excellent enemy variety: champions with many modifiers and plenty of named bosses in each map, all with unique skills and movesets.

• High challenge on the Hard difficulty. It balances well between character build and individual player skill.

• Almost all weapons and skills are viable, distinct, and can integrate into many builds, with few redundancy issues if any… at least until very late game.
[/td]
[td]
• Melee-focused builds become borderline unviable in later game phases due to the obscene amount of one-shots, chain-stuns and hostile AoE.

• Certain enemy skills can outright stunlock and instant-kill you without any chance to avoid them or react. It feels cheap and unfair.

• The storyline and characters feel generic, uninspired and shallow, even for an ARPG.

• The optional Map Challenge system starts well, but later proves too restrictive; it cripples your experience by banning the use of many features.

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Writing & Worldbuilding[/h3]
Many a Hunter vowed to smite the dark forces, and journeyed to Zagoravia to rid it of its curse; none returned. Then again, they were not Victor Vran. The demon-smiting Van Helsing cosplayer ventures alone into the eternal night enveloping the Transylvan-esque city. He does fit the part: hard-boiled one-liners and a demeanor that has no damns left to be given. 

You won’t have any of them left as well, about the story at least, mostly sooner than later. It’s a generic, trite tale of a jaded hero coming to the rescue when all hope is lost, despite himself being cursed by the very forces he swore to destroy. “The abyss also gazes into you” and all that slop. Boring. If the side characters weren’t as insipid or the lore so minimal and dry, maybe I wouldn’t have switched to auto-pilot after just a couple hours. But alas, narrative was never a priority for ARPGs.

Zagoravia doesn’t shine with enticing ambiance. Despite the good variety of environs to visit, from desolate streets to forgotten dwellings and catacombs, none of them feels anything but already seen at any point. Even if coherent and cohesive, the worldbuilding ultimately feels stale. One generic dark fantasy location to the next, without much to note, environmental storytelling only hinted at in the best of cases.

[h3]Exploration & Secrets[/h3]
The cursed city is divided into many districts, one more infested than the previous. You’ll cross them on foot, sparse checkpoints preventing excess backtracking by advancing your respawn position should you perish. As you roam, you’ll come across gates, acting as transitions between levels and doubling as map markers, enabling fast travel from your base at Castle Zagore. There’s no proper open world: even if some areas span far and wide, each is a self-contained stage with its own challenges and fixed enemy spawns. 

There’s no absence of side areas and secrets in each location, many of which are hidden behind destructible objects, illusory walls, or platforming sections that use wall-jumping so that Victor can reach greater heights. Some just have chests with random loot, others even secret bosses and more than a few Easter eggs. It’s worthwhile to seek these out, at least until late game, at which point normal enemies will drop items just as good, or possibly better, than most chests you could find, making it redundant.

[h3]Character Progression & Challenges[/h3]
Unlike most Diablo-like ARPGs, Victor Vran doesn’t have skill trees or attributes. When you level up, you may get new items or other rewards instead. That’s because the entirety of its skill system relies on weapons and gear, rather than class-specific abilities. For instance, a spellcaster Tome will have three skills, the same for all of them no matter the rarity, exceptions are made for Legendary ones, which may have specific modifiers, but could also completely suck. 

It works the same way for each weapon, a feature often paired with unique passives that encourage using that specific weapon in a certain way, like Lighting Guns bouncing their beam between enemies with the Electrified status. You may swap weapons at any time. The same goes for armor sets and consumables, which all have different properties, armor ratings and passive bonuses, and usually, different ways to gain Overdrive, the game’s Mana. This system removes the need to stick to a fixed build and allows completely reworking your gameplay in a few moves: just swap everything and try something new if you get tired of playing the same stuff. On the other hand, it doesn’t allow the build depth and finesse other “classic” ARPGs may have.

The challenges are both the best and most depressing system of this game. On one side, they’ll grant you major XP and loot for completing them, especially early on, but on the other, some of them are tremendous hurdles that will sap your will to continue. Especially when a challenge asks you to not use Potions, Spells and Consumables to kill X enemies without taking damage, and stuff along those lines. All for what? A common chest. Good thing they’re optional; if you’re an achievement hunter though, I’m sorry for your soul.

[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]
Your demon-slaughtering will play out much like any other top-down ARPG around. You’ll be able to swap between two weapons to combine their skills, use consumable potions and other utilities, like AoE bombs, and cast up to two Demon Power spells, which use Overdrive, gained from slaying enemies or in other specific ways depending on the Armor Set you’re using. You can also jump, dodge and parkour around—a necessity, given the amount of projectiles, rushing enemies and hostile AoE in the average fight. At times, it almost feels like a bullet-hell. 

Enemies power up more than you do, to obscene points: by the level cap of 50, on Hard, prepare to get one-shot at a moment’s notice by almost anything, nevermind if you want to be a tank, that’s not going to happen. Bosses, the proper ones, giant health bars and all, have multi-phase designs and are adequately challenging, although the real deal is with the secret ones found in special levels or obscure side areas. Combat is engaging, fun, and well-paced all around. The weight between hits and flying ragdolls emphasize the violence of each hit and explosion. | Great and fun RPG. The base game is very polished. Despite relatively small amount of weapons and outfits, character can be widely customized by demon powers, destiny cards and talismans (DLC). Everything can be upgraded through transmutation. The main story is short, what takes time is completing challenges/elite challenges in all maps. 
Mötorhead DLC is must have for all who love Mötorhead, Fractured Worlds DLC is kind of sad and lazy addition (and achievement grind).
Main character is voiced by Geralt of Rivia. | Victor Vran is a solidly mid-tier ARPG with a distinctive narratorial tone. Combat is fast paced but doesn't have a ton of depth to it, and the areas are generally too long with too much side content. While there are a lot of overlapping mechanics, the absence of a skill tree made it hard for me to see any consequential progression beyond percentage-point increases. That said, it feels okay in the hands and isn't an entirely unpleasant way to while away the hours. That is provided you mute the smug, metatextual narrator and skip the self-serious cutscenes. | I was gonna write some of my gripes and stuff, but nah, aint worth it, this game just plain sucks. | 好久前玩的，无聊刷刷刷还行。","The game is a bit slow, but the graphics are great, and the story is well-drawn."
76561197970698176,317820,Guild of Dungeoneering Ultimate Edition,7.383333333333334,"Indie, RPG",16,"Cute art style, funny presentation, fun gameplay. Just a nice simple game. | A fun game that is easy to learn yet can be quite difficult at times. Once you start playing it continues to captivate you with its thematic artwork and excellent humour. A must try for all deckbuilding fans! | A fun game held back by some limitations in gameplay, some dungeons you just don't draw the map tiles needed to accomplish the goal in a reasonable amount of time. In others you get some powerful items offered and you just run away with the game.
There is some interesting gameplay in the simple style and very simple UI helps this. I didn't have any problems learning how to play the game. (initially I did when I had never played a card game before, and came back some years later to give it another shot and found it comically easy after playing several games now)

You'll lose a few adventurers just down to bad luck, sometimes you'll just get wrecked by being forced to fight an enemy  above their level. And sometimes you (or at least I) make mistakes, it happens but those mistakes can cost your adventurers their lives, something the game makes very clear to the player and it's not even meant to be a big deal, more adventurers will sign up very quickly.

So the interesting thing about this game is the maps are basically randomly generated from a set of tiles/enemies and loot. You build the dungeon, ideally towards a specific goal (kill the boss, collect X gold things and so on), unfortunately it's not quite as fun as it sounds. You'll sometimes get some very strong enemies you have to place, other times you'll get swamped with lots of low level opponents on the map and the dungeon will feel like a chore.
There's a little bit too much rng in what map cards are offered, and no way to edit or adjust the drawing of cards for that mechanic.

The actual combat is fairly quick and once you get to grips with the game. I'll say the first level or two of your adventurers seems to be when they're most vulnerable which is problematic because this is when the players are first using them, so most folk will never find out the stronger versions of your little gang of adventurers. (the traits can be powerful)
The biggest issue for me is that hp is just a bit too important, just a single point is enough to swing the outcome of some fights. 

You get to customise them but it's very basic, some hairstyle changes, rename them and a choice of 1 male or female voice. I started to get glazed eyes after customising my 8th or 9th adventurers, at some point the random visuals don't really matter, all that really matters at least to me was being able to complete the dungeons without losing the adventurers.

The level ups for the adventurers were a little limited, I think they mostly got +1 hp and after completing a dungeon they got a trait. I would have liked a bit of a skill tree to open up, rather than yet more rng.
The only real choice the player has in character customisation is what item they get to pick when they get the option in each dungeon.

The game is okay overall, it functions well (as it should, it's pretty simple in presentation). But eventually I saw through most of the mechanics over time and became a bit disappointed in how it wasn't simple enough to just let me have a fun time (adventurers die pretty easily), or complex enough for me to feel in control (lacking higher levels of customisation in various areas). 
Yet the game is fairly hard, particularly when you're first fighting a type of enemy for the first time in various types of dungeons. Once you get how to beat them it's no big deal, but until that point it's not a fun time.
It is however quick, each run is easily 30 minutes to complete or less so it's hard to feel to upset about it.

Honestly if I could offer on a sliding scale of review somewhere in the neutral region between positive and negative I would. (when I was having fun it was close to 8/10 experience, when I wasn't it was more like 3/10.  I don't know how to boil that down into one score)
You might enjoy what's on offer if you're really curious but for the most part new games do most of what this one does better and in more advanced and/or intuitive ways. 

Ever since slay the spire came out it's hard to argue anyone buy this game over something like that. Or even darkest dungeon. Or a whole host of other card games/rpgs if you want that kind of experience.

I respect this game for trying to tie together card games and dungeon delving but it just wasn't quite there for me. Not strong enough card mechanics to engage me on an intellectual level and not strong enough story/setting to get me immersed in the world/adventurers. Too hard to let me take it lightly and too comedic for me to take it seriously.

Anyways I'd still like to thank the devs for giving it a shot and working on the game for a good while after it came out. So many other devs just abandon projects if they're not immediate successes. | Oddly fun cheeky little game.  

Did you like playing Munchkin with friends, but you got old and got responsibilities?  Never hang out and play games?  This game is like playing Munchkin by yourself.  At least you have memories of having friends, right?

Seriously, though.  Feels like playing the solitaire version of Munchkin.",...

Bought this game and beat it in a 2 hour session, just love love love this game ! 

Impossible to lose at this game unless you are not crafty and able to read the storyline well !!! | It's not hard to see why this game is still considered a classic, even for those who aren't superfans of the point and click adventure genre. I played Maniac Mansion on NES years ago and loved it, and while this game is a bit of a departure from it (you don't build a party at the beginning, the three characters don't interact in the same environments), it brings a lot of fun new elements to the table, like the amazing voicework (apart from Laverne, who feels almost comatose by comparison).

The graphics (I played the ""retro version"", which I'd recommend) are fun and colorful and cartoony, and remind me distinctly of Earthwork Jim. One of my few complaints about the game is the sound design; it's full to bursting with all manner of rehashed Saturday morning cartoon sound effects, which work fine, but the background music is drab and uninteresting. I only bring it up because Maniac Mansion had some of the best music of any game of any generation.

The game does have some intensely moon brain puzzle logic, but in my experience if you're playing a tongue-in-cheek cartoony point and click game, that's part of the package. One of the achievements, which you get after a particularly implausible puzzle, is actually called ""Oh yeah, I'm playing a cartoon"".

This game isn't for everyone, just as this genre isn't for everyone. But if it's For You, you'll know it. | A classic from the good old days of adventure gaming. Beautiful remaster. | It is what it says. A remaster of the classic DotT. I have not seen anything removed or changed in any bad way. It is the same game - but with better graphics. Also there is a possibility of having some of the creaters comment as you play along. That is a huge feature in itself.

Perhaps it appeals less to people not familiar with DotT. But if so it is a more modern way to play the game.

It is a very well meant and well made remaster of a fantastic game. | I absolutely love this game. Played it through so many times back in the days of 486 pcs. Can still pretty much breeze through it all.

Сложно называть игру плохой, если она представляет из себя нечто среднее. Однако по моему ИМХО любое событие, произведение или явление должно вызывать эмоциональный отклик в душе и мозговую активность в черепе. Если этого не происходит, то вам подсунули какую-то жвачку для мозга, продукт игросодержащий или, если называть вещи своими именами, чушь собачью.

Почему Crashlands сложно назвать плохой, хотя о хорошей она не является?

[h3] Слишком нормально [/h3]

Тут есть какой-никакой сюжет, есть хорошие анимации, шутейки и бодрые персонажи. Нет багов, нет микротранзакций, нет даже собственного лаунчера. Игра страдает от чрезмерной нормальности. Разработчики, как родители с повышенной тревожностью, теряют контроль над чувством меры, из-за чего ребёнок, то бишь игра, растёт в условиях дичайшей гиперопеки. 

В итоге выходя в общество, оно не знает, как вести себя. Как общаться с игроком, где его подразнить, где поддаться, а где нагрубить. Если опуститься до метафор ниже пояса, то Crashlands – самое что ни на есть настоящее бревно в постели.

Ты не можешь проиграть, потому что запас жизней бесконечен – тебя всегда респавнит; не можешь потерять свои припасы, потому что инвентарь не имеет дна и находится где-то в параллельном измерении, а предметы при смерти не дропаются; тут даже нельзя пропустить или не скрафтить что-либо, ведь каждый предмет либо привязан к конкретному событию в игре, либо требует настолько мало ресурсов, что не создать его просто нельзя. 

[h3] Непонятно, зачем в это играть  [/h3]

Если рекомендации стима или ваше собственное ощущение сказали, что игра похожа на серию Don’t Starve или Terraria – не верьте. Кроме ракурса камеры ничего общего они не имеют. Крашлэндс вообще мало на что похожа, кроме тысяч мобилок, где можно тапать по экрану, особо не задумываясь над действиями, и при этом выигрывать. Такой концепт хорош для детей, но взрослый человек вряд ли найдёт что-то увлекательное в подобном. 

В Crashlands нет ни челленджа, ни вариативности, ни красоты. Можно понавтыкать разных построек, посдавать квесты пару часов, но потом начинается скука. Приятный визуальный стиль и неплохой саундтрек не спасают положение. Для того, чтобы стать расслабляющей гриндилкой, ей не хватает сложности и собственных фишек. Чтобы сместиться в сторону медитативности или приятной репепативности – разнообразия контента. Даже в разряд юмора и шуток её никак не отнесёшь, потому что улыбка от происходящего возникнет всего пару раз в начале, а потом быстро уйдёт, никогда больше не вернувшись. Короче, через какое-то время буквально появляется вопрос в голове «зачем я в это играю»?

Factions all have really strong flavor and personality, so it's nice to just catch a vibe with. Definitely recommended if you're into Stellaris but don't always have the mental bandwidth to create your own roleplay as you go. Turn-based as well, adding to the chill factor. All-around solid game. | One of my favorite games ever. 

Pros:
+ Visuals are eye candy. Smooth and pleasing.
+ Music is ear candy. One of the absolute best soundtracks I have heard from a game.
+ The game-play is very fun, a little overwhelming at first but then it all falls into place.
+ It's turn-base and while not really a plus, I know some folks enjoy calculating their every move unlike RTS.
+ Unlike Stellaris, (another goat) this game has some pretty good lore.

- I HATE HACKING, I DON'T CARE FOR IT, TAKE IT AWAY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD | [h2] Endless Space 2 - Наследница первой пробы пера [/h2]
[i] Я начинал свой путь еще с Endless Space 1 и Endless Space 2 является достойным продолжением вселенной Endless. Участвовал в бета тесте игры и активностях на форуме разработчиков (Таких как выбор внешности некоторых фракций - Несгибаемые и Хор Теней). У игры был долгий путь разработки и она стала результатом трудов, в том числе, многих фанатов вселенной Endless. Что получилось в итоге? [/i]
[h2] За что стоит ее любить эту игру [/h2] 
[list]
    [*][i] Фракции - каждая фракция уникальна, любой игрок сможет выбрать фракцию на свой вкус. Некоторые перекочевали из первой части, но еще больше новых. Основных фракций восемь (без дополнений). Каждая фракция имеет свой сюжет и приличное количество заданий, что помогут познакомиться с ними поближе. 
Например, хочешь быть безумным ученым? Софоны будут тебе по душе, а внешне они напоминают причудливых зеленых человечков. 
Думаешь, что путь к победе, это развитие промышленности и влияние? Единая империя (Местное человечество) идет по этому пути, но даже этот путь ты сможешь изменить. Остаться на пути промышленности, стать ученым или наращивать военную мощь? Ты сможешь принимать судьбоносные решения. [/i]
    [*][i] Геймплей - По сравнению с Endless Space 1 и Endless Legend, расширили и сделали глубже все элементы 4х-стратегий. 
Прохождение основного сюжета поведает вам Академии, космической гильдии героев и ее лидере. Наличие множества побочных заданий, наткнуться на которые ты сможешь просто исследуя мир. Без преувеличения, интересное исследование бескрайнего космоса, где даже исследование странного сигнала на планете, может привести к неожиданному результату. 
Изучение различных веток технологий, от возможности колонизации неприветливых миров до постройки огромных военных крейсеров. Колонизация новых миров и их развитие, в том числе уникальных планет, что были оставлены древней, более развитой расой. Огромное количество торговых и дипломатических возможностей, от покупки ценных ресурсов до заключения альянса между империями. И самые проработанные и захватывающие космические сражения, лучшие в своем жанре. [/i]
    [*][i] Графика - Начиная с главного меню и заканчивая роликом победы одной из фракций, все что вы уведите, будет выглядеть волшебно и завораживающе. Эта игра подарит вам ощущение бескрайнего и неизведанного, местами причудливого космоса (Как на счет фракции высокоразвитых деревьев или роботов, что больше напоминают насекомых поглощающих все на своем пути?). Каждый арт, каждый ролик или эффект от взрыва планеты выполнен на недосягаемо качественном уровне. На мой личный взгляд, в этой игре космос выполнен лучше всего и крупные франшизы, такие как Mass Effect или Star Wars не передают даже крупицы этой красоты. [/i]
    [*][i] Музыка Endless Space 2 - это шедевр, который погружает вас в атмосферу космоса и подчеркивает эпичность происходящего. Композитор Arnaud Roy создал великолепный саундтрек, который идеально сочетается с визуальным стилем игры и подчёркивает уникальность каждой фракции. Музыка разнообразна и эмоциональна. Здесь вы услышите эпические и величественные мелодии, которые сопровождают ваши великие открытия и завоевания, а также более спокойные и лирические треки, которые звучат во время мирного развития империи. [/i]
[/list]
[h2] К сожалению есть и ложка дёгтя в этой бочке мёда [/h2]
[list]
    [*][i] Порог вхождения и интерфейс - как в любой 4х-стратегии это вызов для игрока. Разобраться в механиках игры может быть сложно. В игре есть обучение, но к сожалению оно не столь подробное и даже после его прохождения могут остаться вопросы. Интерфейс игры - это лабиринт из различных вкладок и информации (В том числе сокращений по типу ""5П"", которые не сразу будут ясны новому игроку.). На первый взгляд он выглядит запутанным, но со временем вы привыкнете к нему. К счастью, он не такой перегруженный как в Stellaris. [/i]
    [*][i] Искусственный интеллект - иногда принимает странные решения. К примеру, ты накопил много Пыли (Местная валюта), он может предложить отдать все. С какой радости? Но в целом, он достаточно умен, чтобы бросить вам вызов. [/i]
    [*][i] Дополнения к игре запишу скорее в минусы, так как выходят сомнительными через один. Особенно вызывают вопросы такие дополнения как - Supremacy и Awakening. Подробнее о них расскажу в отдельных обзорах. [/i]
[/list]

[b] Вывод: [/b] [i] Играя Endless Space 2 ты забываешь о времени и погружаешься в мир космических приключений. Как и в любой 4х-стратегии, ты можешь сесть за нее и спустя десяток часов осознать, что провел весь день в этом мире. Она не идеальна, но её достоинства с лихвой перекрывают недостатки. Некоторые недостатки можно исправить, к примеру починить ИИ, в мастерской есть моды, что отлично справляются с этим. Но если ты решил поиграть с друзьями, то этот недостаток не будет заметен вовсе. Если вы любите космос и стратегии, то Endless Space 2 - это ваш выбор <З [/i] | 戦闘は陣形を設定したらあとは見てるだけだがそれが良い

Ceder ante esa banda de tóxicos pseudojusticieros a buen seguro que a la larga ha sido todo un palo para la desarrolladora y la publicadora, porque dudo que los wokes empezaran a comprar el juego tras la censura.

Hay que tener en cuenta que los anteriores desarrolladores introdujeron algo de censura, pero los nuevos cogieron la tijera de podar y se han puesto a eliminar cosas que no tienen sentido, porque si bien se parodia al régimen nazi, nunca se los pone como a los buenos de la película, y si bien las escenas introductorias de Big Band eran muy duras, en ningún momento mostraban aquello como algo digno de elogio y/o a imitar, sino todo lo contrario. Sí, Skullgirs era un juego gamberro, pero eso era parte de su alma y nadie estaba obligado a comprar el juego.

En resumidas cuentas y viendo que me han cambiado el producto que compré, me veo en la obligación de suspenderlo. Tras todo lo publicado, posiblemente alguno pensará que soy otro zombi de la alt-right, pero nada más lejos de la realidad. Soy una persona con unas profundas convicciones de izquierdas, pero claro, cometo el pecado de ser una persona muy de los 90 del siglo pasado, y siendo un español descendiente de personas que huyeron de la dictadura franquista, me deja perplejo que parte de la izquierda actual viva obsesionada con reinstaurar una censura más bien propia de un dictador al que presuntamente desprecian. | i dont know what half of the mechanics are but holy shit big band and beowulf are peak masculinity even while being the only 2 male characters in a game full of females with huge badongadongs | Jogo muito bem feito, mas só recomendo pra quem não fica de mimimi pra qualquer coisa. | This is the perfect example of a fighting game that's clearly well-made but not for me.

What started off as an indie game is clearly inspired by Marvel vs. Capcom, and it shows. A lot of the mechanics follow the typical team-based fighting game style with assists. The main gimmick I like is that you can (in theory) pick only 2 or even 1 character and have your health scale up, but generally, this is not recommended.

The character designs certainly ""stick out,"" but I've personally never been into the art style of Skullgirls; it definitely has that ""early Western indie game"" feel.

While the game is kind of fun to mess around with solo, I just don't think it's as enjoyable or polished as later (or even earlier) team games when playing against any competition. The balance is super whack and heavily reliant on combos and Touch of Death mechanics, with not many good defensive options.

The story mode is amusing enough, and I'm glad it's fully voiced, but I just didn't really care about any of the characters by the end, even though I completed all the story modes (in the Switch version).

When this game was one of the few to actually use GGPO rollback netcode, I might have given it a more positive recommendation. However, with so many more dynamic, better-looking, balanced, and more fun-to-play versions of anime-style/team-based fighting games available now, Skullgirls just doesn't hold up for me personally these days.

I do have to give props for showing that indie fighting games can be a thing, especially lasting over a decade. | This is quite simply, mechanically, the best tag fighter on the market and it came out in 2012.  that says a lot.  tier lists? useless.

76561197970698176,57300,Unknown,0.55,,0,"Прошёл данную шикарную и легендарную игру целых 4 раза. Здесь прекрасно абсолютно все.

Атмосфера здесь на высоте. Постоянный мрак, какие-то скрипы, звуки криков и ко всему этому периодически проявляющиеся воспоминания главного героя о его призраках прошлого. Звуковое и музыкальное сопровождение также очень гармонично подчеркивают происходящее на экране. Периодически, по ходу игры, в голове героя всплывают различные сцены с диалогами, которые, в общем-то, проливают свет на его историю. Также по ходу прохождение предстоит собираться многочисленные записки, из которых можно узнать много интересного. 

Сама история игры и сюжет кажутся простыми и лаконичными, но при этом очень яркими и насыщенными, благодаря чему за столь небольшой отрезок времени, который занимает полное прохождение игры, возможно в полной мере проникнуться сюжетом и повествованием. Кстати, здесь есть русская озвучка и она очень качественная и аутентичная.

Графика в игре также очень приятная. Все работает очень плавно и без каких-либо багов и прочего. Движок сделан очень качественно, физика в игре хорошо работает на атмосферу во время различных сцен, а у игрока есть возможность перетаскивать и метать многие предметы окружения.

Что касается полного прохождения игры на 100%, а именно - получения всех достижений, то здесь есть пара недостатков. Большинство ачивок смело можно назвать простыми, так как большую их часть дают за сугубо сюжетные моменты, которые обязательно нужно будет сделать по ходу прохождения. С DLC уже нужно быть чуть внимательнее, ибо в нем нет никаких чекпоинтов и его нужно пройти от начала до конца целых три раза (на разные концовки). Но в общем, оно не такое уж и сложное. Единственное, так это то, что если случайно умереть - то вас просто выкинет из игры на рабочий стол, что слегка неудобно. На мой личный взгляд, двумя наиболее неприятными достижениями в Amnesia: TDD являются Illuminatus (на сбор 151 огнива) и Мазохист (прохождение игры на хардкорном режиме). Сбор всех 151 огнив - просто скукотища, а о хардкоре чуть далее.

Теперь несколько слов о хардкор-моде. Я не скажу, что он какой-то прям ультра сложный, скорее наоборот, он достаточно простой. Для начала стоит отметить, что я не фанат таких вот перепрохождений игры с доп. условиями и люблю получать все ачивки за одно прохождение, но это ещё ладно. В хардкорном режиме есть платные сохранения, которые тратят огнива (которых стало в разы меньше). Плюсом ко всему прочему теперь возможно умереть из-за очень низкого уровня рассудка. Это просто максимально растягивает и без того не самое интересно повторное прохождение игры. Особенно, когда ты вынужден стоять и ждать восстановления уровня рассудка возле свечи/факела/окна. Я знаю, что из игры вырезали расходник под названием ""отрезвин"", который мог восполнить уровень рассудка (как опиум здоровье). Отчасти я согласен с разработчиками, что он был вырезан из нормальной сложности. Однако, хочу отметить, что в хард-моде тот же опий не имеет смысла, так как монстры (тени) убивают игрока с одного удара, а какие-либо другие травмы получить до смерти - это ещё нужно постараться.

В общем, несмотря на небольшие недостатки по поводу достижений, игра очень классная и её смело можно назвать классикой жанра хоррор. Рекомендую поиграть в нее всем любителям мрака, отличной атмосферы, а также интересной и насыщенной истории. | Очень классная игра, графика конечно старая, но игре очень много лет как никак, не особо страшная советую к покупке и прохождению. 

100% | Playing Amnesia: The Dark Descent in 2025 was an eye-opening experience. Despite its age, it stands tall among modern horror games. The gameplay feels polished, with physics-based interactions that remain impressive. While I’m not the biggest fan of puzzles, the game strikes a great balance. They’re neither too easy nor too hard, and they’re tied to the narrative in ways that make solving them rewarding.

The story is the heart of the game, delivered in a way that’s mysterious and compelling. It kept me curious throughout, as every note and memory revealed critical details. Paying close attention to the story isn’t just enriching, it’s essential. The narrative is layered with meaning, and small decisions can impact the outcome significantly.

While the game isn’t overwhelmingly scary, perhaps due to my higher scare tolerance, the tension is palpable. The NPCs are faster than you, so running is often your only option. This mechanic, coupled with the eerie atmosphere, keeps you on edge. One standout feature is the immediate feedback when solving puzzles, which subtly confirms you’re on the right track without breaking immersion.

It’s funny to think I discovered this classic through PewDiePie years ago. The rich story, creative gameplay, and immersive design make it a must-play, even today. Modern horror games could learn a lot from Amnesia’s creativity and depth.

Rating: 9/10. Playing it in 2025 was absolutely worth the time. | Many good things are well presented in this game, but the bad things are also obvious. Amnesia: The Dark Descent is ""a puzzle game"" with a horror theme; not a horror game with puzzles as a side dish. So, if you are a brain-dead person (like me), you are surely not going to make it through this game without a guide as the game gives you very little direction.

The atmosphere is terrific. The sound and character designs are well done. I really like all the elements of this game. However, bad things still exist. First of all, in this game, when the sanity drops, the screen becomes blurry, causing motion sickness and destroying your eyesight; this is very bad, even an FPS gamer like me can barely tolerate it. Secondly, dying makes the game easier; this is a very bad concept for me. Besides these, it is actually a good game. | Не рекомендую 👎
Долго думал как оценить игру по достоинству, но после двойного прохождения основной игры + DLC и всех ачивок всё стало однозначно. Изначально я давал фору ведь у игры большая фан база,огромные оценки и вышла она в 2010 году, но вспомнил что в это время вышли Mafia 2, Mass Effect 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Heavy Rain,CoD:MW2 достойна ли она находится среди таких культовых игр?Есть ощущение что оценки сильно завышены из-за ностальгии,разберем по фактам сюжет-в начале слегка интригует на деле бессмысленная глупая графомания, графика  в момент выхода на 2010 уже была устаревшей, физика-отличная приятна как в HL2 возможно даже чуть лучше но какой смысл если её удалить ничего не изменится, все локации скучные однообразные и не запоминающиеся, так же скрипты (они везде) просто мобов спавнит где хочет,а отворачиваешься на секунду и он исчез.DLC-это отвратительное абсурдное идиотское убожество в которое что бы зайти надо читать гайды и к сожалению пройти меня заставили ачивки. Про ачивки я тоже ничего хорошего сказать не могу, тебя принуждают пройти линейный хоррор 2 раза ну вот зачем такую глупость добавлять,в общем не пойму чем многим запала в душу игра, возможно сюжетом раскинутым на 300 записочек и скриптовыми мобами а может чем то другим.

https://www.spaziogames.it/recensioni/The-Dwarves-242310

Se il nome The Dwarves ha fatto suonare un campanello nella vostra testa, vuol dire che conoscete bene il panorama fantasy internazionale. L'ambientazione del gioco non è infatti farina del sacco degli sviluppatori, ma riprende quanto raccontato all'interno dell'omonimo romanzo (Die Zwerge in lingua originale) scritto nel 2003 dal giornalista tedesco Markus Heitz. Il libro, tradotto anche in italiano col nome Le Cinque Stirpi, dà in il via a una saga dark fantasy.

Dopo la doverosa introduzione letteraria passiamo al The Dwarves videogioco, che come dicevamo riprende la storia narrata nel primo capitolo per calarci nei panni di Tungdil Manodoro. Pur vivendo in un mondo in cui i nani sono divisi tra ben cinque stirpi (da qui il nome del libro), Tungdil non ha mai conosciuto nessuno della propria razza. Sin dalla tenera età è stato infatti cresciuto tra la fucina e i libri da Lot-Ionan, un potente mago che col suo potere contribuisce a difendere la regione delle Terre Nascoste dall'invasione delle immancabili forze nemiche di natura malvagia.

La complessità delle battaglie va dunque sottolineata: da un lato il livello di sfida è altissimo, costringendo i giocatori a tenere sempre d’occhio il terreno di scontro e a non distrarsi mai per neanche un secondo, dall’altro perfino al livello di difficoltà facile diversi scontri non danno tregua, dunque bisogna constatare che la difficoltà poteva decisamente essere calibrata meglio, e sicuramente non si tratta di un gioco da consigliare a coloro che vogliono semplicemente godersi la storia. I giocatori che sceglieranno di addentrarsi in questa avventura devono avere calma e sangue freddo, e dovranno assicurarsi di avere sempre gli oggetti che servono nell’inventario, i quali possono davvero fare la differenza tra la vita e la morte. 

Conclusioni personali: Gioco consigliato ma, ammetto, un titolo del genere, con una trama così solida, necessitava di molte più scene, molti più dialoghi e interazioni con i personaggi, c'è così tanto da dire e da 
 scoprire sulla lore che ciò che vediamo nel gioco non basta a soddisfare la curiosità (leggete il libro), inoltre manca la possibilità di esplorare le mappe durante l'avanzata della storia, un mondo così ben caratterizzato aveva bisogno di spazio. I regni nanici sono incredibili e il design dei personaggi è azzeccato con le descrizioni dei libri, peccato che la storia scorra molto velocemente (il gioco durerà una decina di ore in totale) e che le mappe non si possano esplorare... Immagino per motivi di budget, la trama è fedele ma dannatamente sintetica. Sogno un remake con lo stesso stile grafico, stessi doppiatori ma nello stile di esplorativo di ""Dragon Age Inquisition"". Bella la scelta di usare una voce narrante che accompagna il giocatore nella storia, mi ha ricordato titoli come ""Baldurs Gate 3"".
 | Средненькая RPG. Боёвка довольно пресненькая, но игра сама по себе короткая и надоесть не успевает. Местами багованная/неудобная (зелья часто не работают, врагов на сером фоне иногда не видно — приходится бродить по полю боя и водить мышкой по экрану, чтобы их найти, деньги практически не нужны). Сюжетик простой, но рабочий, вполне достаточный для 11-часовой игры. В целом игра довольно средняя, но так как короткая (прошёл за 2 дня), не успевает надоесть. Удовольствие от неё получил, хотя я и не то чтобы искушённый геймер. Если хотите коротенькую линейную RPG — по скидке можно взять.","The Dwarves is a fantasy novel by Lot-Ionan, a powerful mago who has contributed to the region of Nascoste from the invasion of the immanent forces of the Nemesis."

It's like everything I wish ""Smugglers V"" did not exclude, like being open-ended and making actual use of its flavorful prose descriptions for stations and interactions and stories and news and stuff that Smugglers basically touts as a relatively impressive feature that I found disappointing, especially compared to Endless Sky. I prefer to opt out of combat missions like escorting science ships and luxury liners and prefer to stick with one ship as opposed to building up an entire fleet, and my list only includes the last few things I did to get to the point at which I could pass that up as an option. Oh, and there's WAY more planets and ships than Smugglers, it's not even comparable in that respect.

I got it for free, so yes, definitely worth it, but I would have paid whatever I paid for Smugglers V AND its expansion and have been perfectly satisfied. And it's still in development, but perfectly stable for me, easy to mod, and it's possible to overcome the somewhat wonky combat controls that some complain about, or at least become familiar enough to where I can fight off several (very weak) raiders (that had no business preying on almost defenseless victims) in a transport ship.

Tonight I will dream about transporting families of miners and farmers and desperate immigrants hoping to find a better life on a different alien world. | This game, where to start...

As of the Coalition's update (0.9.5 unstable beta) there's the depreciation of modules and ships to contend with. If you like the previous version, just go to the github and get a previous version.

1. Anyways: the map is big, still expanding, and has plenty as-is to offer. There's aliens, civil wars, and planets to conquer.
You can be a humble merchant, trading and hauling for steady pay. There's also passenger courier work which require the safe-keeping of those aboard to arrive at their destination. Escort duties involves distracting and attacking pirates then escaping before your objective gets destroyed. Bounty-hunting requires combat reputation, so getting a bigger, stronger ship and going pirate hunting will build up your rep to be given those high paying contracts. Or even do some of each just to make end's-met.

2. When starting out, even if you want to get a feel for the game on your own: TAKE THE TUTORIAL!!! It pays, it gets you going in a definative path, and you can buy some local maps (which it's highly recommended to just buy maps early on). Once you open up the sky with areas you have explored, do some jobs for a while within them. There are two time markers early in that you can use as reference points to gauge off of. If you manage to pay off your loan before Rememberance Day, you did awesome. If you pay it off before the Civil War, great. If you can't pay it off until after then, you may need to rethink your career choice.

3. Don't worry about goofing off and exploring or anything until AFTER you pay off your first debt (like I said before, buy some maps so you don't go stumbling about early on). If you are having problem with the Pirates, stick to the middle and 'north-west' part of the map and do trading. If you are in the mood for salvaging or capturing ships, aim for the 'south-west' area around Aldhibain (five jumps 'south south-west of Rutilicus/home-planet) since there is both a strong merchant & local milita and Pirate raids. Also, the planet within the Aldhibain has both an Outfitter & Shipyard along with the trader, so you can not only sell the parts you get, you can sell any captured ships, equipt any modules you aquire or buy new ones when you get the money for them.

4. Lastly, once you upgrade your ship (anything over $million should do) go explore and visit each unexplored spot. Can't reach there? No worries, you will soon enough. If you prefer a more peaceful venture (aside from Pirates) visit the 'north north-east' area. Want to fight some tough enemies? Visist the 'east' area and say 'hello' to the new-comers (with several salvos of cannons). Once you unlock advanced flight, throw yourself to the far corners of the galaxy and discover all there is to this game.

5. ...then finally, once you do everything this game has to offer: quit it. Yes, quit... for a few months, go play something else,  do real-life things.

6. Then come back and find new contents has updated... then you can start a new save and play through the whole thing in record time.

7. See 5, 6 & 7 for further instructions.

 | How is this game free? I have no idea. Could easily be worth $20 or more. 

One of the greatest aspects of this game is its ease of organization and navigation. There are so many ships, weapons and stars that you could very easily get lost and frustrated trying to remember where everything is had the developers not taken that into consideration. You can see the prices of everything in every system and where every piece of equipment you've discovered is sold. You can access everything's stats to plan out trips. | Absolutely incredible. Some people see ""2D"" and leave. Not me. I love space, and I love this kind of game. The commerce is relaxing, and the combat is intense. This is what indie games should be. Better than NMS AND FREE! Would be 10/10, but -1 for no music.","I'm not sure what to say about this game, but I'm not sure what to say about the tutorial."

Но конкретно данная версия постоянно удаляет прогресс игрока, контрольные точки его сперва сохраняют а потом вновь теряют, в итоге приходится перепроходить целые уровни одним залпом, что крайне утомительно и затратно по времени. Так же именно в этой версии невозможно посмотреть свой прогресс по спасению пленников как это реализовано в других версиях игры. В купе с тем, что прогресс ещё и теряется случайным образом, это рунит полностью прохождение часто.

Became friends and even let him come stay at my house for a week. VR does crazy things. | [h1]AltspaceVR - [i]A free little social space to play and interact with friends, both new and old, in vr or out![/i][/h1]

This is a fun little social application that allows you and your friends to get together virtually, what makes it stand out a little from the others (full disclosure i am yet to try the others, they are on my todo list though) is the fact that Rift/Vive/GearVR an all co-exist happily and even 2d friends can join the fun (not that my friends are 2 dimensional of course, i mean friends who play on normal flat 2d screens can play too with almost fps style controls).
As well as getting together for a natter you can also watch youtube or play games together (I am personally rather fond of Holograms against Humanity, which does make me wonder if i am a bad human being lol).
They even host events, debates, comedians, open mic nights, the works.

[b]ROOMSCALE / ENVIRONMENT[/b] 
The areas in altspace are very nicely made and the ease of which you can move around them is pretty good, however it is not perfect, there is no way on the vive to set your height, so if you are small or if you want to sit down after a hard day at work you can expect to see from around waist height (This can be circumvented by using “advanced settings” app for steamvr, but really it should be built into altspaceVR given the hours you can spend in here), however that little niggle aside, the room scale works fantastically and the environments are varied and pretty cool.
You can also setup your own event, in which you choose the area and have control of the nodes in that zone for loading up pre made apps/ games or just displaying the web in. Each environment has specific loading nodes in set areas, moving stuff about is tricky (and requires assistance), this is an area it could improve in.
There are a few games you can play that really benefit from roomscale, i was hooked on disc golf (a combination of frisbee and golf) when i first tried the app ….and as i type this i am telling myself that i have to play it again! …. That just would not work as well in a 2d flat screen game. Also the maze just would not be the same with out “being there”, and that is the thing of VR it puts you there, be it a virtual maze or the front row of a comedy show (despite the lack of variety in avatars, the ones they do have are well made and you can tell when people are looking at you or other people, it all helps create the illusion that you are in this world watching a comedy show with 10 or 15 people and not in your front room blindfolded by vr while your cat sneaks the chicken out the kitchen and to her bed )


[b]GRAPHICS[/b] 
As touched on before the graphics of the areas are pretty cool, the avatars however are rather limited, there is a handful of designs, all pretty cool, and you can change their colours, but there is certainly not enough variety here, my friend and long suffering co-host of my old youtube videos (they are on pause at the minute) plays as a floating robot head, when i see it i immediately think “Mr Mole!” until i see the name tag and ah nope it is RandomSomething554334 :( 
While i feel the avatars let it down you pretty soon get used to it and the rest of the graphics are fine, when you have a huge youtube wall up the videos are crisp and detailed, webpages are more than readable and the games are spot on.

[b]PERFORMANCE[/b] 
I have not had any performance issues with altspace, not one.


[b]INTUITIVENESS[/b] 
While it is not exactly rocket science it does take a little bit to get used to what icon does what and how to use them, it could do with a better explanation of the basic functions, however there is always help at the welcome centre, AltspaceVR has a real live human on at all times who are happy to help you and teach you, I have overheard them dealing with less than savory people too and yet to hear a moderator lose their temper (since my day job involves a ton of customer service, i can tell you that is no easy feat lol) So not intuitive but not so anti intuitive that you will be cursing it, learn how to block people though. (aim at them and click the ….oh man it’s gone out of my head, but the icon will be clear ) and click it.

[b]MULTIPLAYER:[/b] 
Well it is a social application so multiplayer is the key. Thanks to AltspaceVR being available on so many formats (and free, let us not forget the fact it is all free) there is a large population and you will often see large groups of people at all hours. As has already been mentioned there is a moderator on at all times, and you can block people so any issues with unruly people who decide that real world social norms are not applicable in virtual reality can be dealt with really fast, if you block them it is like they no longer exist. The times i have had to block someone are few and far between and most people i have met are great and a good laugh, you see their name and smile “ah itis sara!” or “cool, cats is joining the game”, you get to know them is what i am trying to say.  

[b]PROS:[/b] 
[list]
[*]Very well moderated (always a member of staff online and easily contactable)
[*]Massive support for developers wishing to make apps for their rooms or players making events. 
[*]On the whole a friendly community.
[*]Its free!
[*]You can be in vr with non vr mates.
[*]Tons of events (all free)
[*]Tons of free games that are actually so fun they could have charged for.
[*]You can create your own private room and watch funny cat youtube videos with your mates even if your all miles of real world distance apart.
[*]Play dnd with your mates. 
[*]Easy to block trolls.
[/list]

[b]CONS:[/b] 
[list]
[*]Not enough avatar variety for a game with such a high population.
[*]A very small amount of people believe social standards do not apply in vr and can ruin your fun briefly (while easy to block, this is still a negative).
[*]No way to adjust your height on the vive (without third party tools)
[/list]

[b]VERDICT[/b] 
For adults it is a fun application and given its free i urge you all to try it, however due to the nature of Holograms against Humanity (a 3d version of Cards against Humanity) and the few people who do not know how to behave, it is not something suitable for the younger crowd to use unsupervised. Fully worth putting time into it though, go play disc golf :) or if you are not easily, play Holograms against Humanity (try not to feel too bad when you laugh at the cards) and if you see a robot called dave(mrgreaper) that just may be me, or my clone, or if really low to the floor…..my cat.

 | You need a little AltspaceVR in your life.  New events, apps and spaces happening all the time.  A room full of people singing  karaoke with the music on silent.  Hilarious :-) | Es un juego muy bueno en el cual puedes elegir personaje y jugar con demas personas en distintos mapas

de verdad lo recomiendo | in a year altspace has not change at all or really updated much kinda went stale ,i highly reccomend everyone coming to V.R Chat its a billion times better so many worlds to run around arena battles a vr tv show gunters universe  it has so much more community then Altspace ,vr chat is updated all the time ,forget about boring altspace and come to V.R Chat .....ALTSPACE 0/10.....V.R CHAT 10/10",VR is a great social application.

Nice artwork and setting too. | Świetna strzelanka łącząca klimaty Postapo oraz Cyberpunk. Widać, że autorzy tworząc grę wzorowali się na znanych markach takich jak Quake oraz Wolfenstein. | Very fun shooter with a short lenght but very replayable, the improvements and changes from the original to Redux make the experience a lot less frustrating and feel like a fair challenge. I beat the game in hard, insane and heroic mode and I thought I was going to struggle a lot more. The cyberpunk setting is fantastic and the encounters feel chaotic and fun. Quick switching weapons is very important, trying to keep them stunned as long as possible helps a lot to deal with the biggest threats. If you re looking for a game that scratches that Serious sam/Painkiller itch, then I really recommend giving Hard reset redux a try. | Прекрасная была игра в своё время, но, даже сейчас играется в удовольствие, но, есть несколько вещей, которые портят игровой опыт и атмосферу:
1. Наличие невидимых стен, при чём сделанных не для уровней (у нас коридорный шутер), а для ограничения игрока во взаимодействии с миром, потому со скалы спрыгнуть можно, а запрыгнуть на рядом стоящий ящик нет. Осознание, что применив смекалку и фантазию, без них (преград) можно было обойтись, невероятно бесило.. видно, что кому-то было лень, ведь когда есть невидимые стены, левел дизайн не нужен) 
2. Отсутствие разнообразия ""мостров"" и перестрелок с ними, во второй половине игры, хорошенько так достали.. при чём достали конкретно те, которых ввели с середины игры и начали добавлять в каждый уровень до самого конца. Повторялись не только мобы, но и вид локации в которой ты только что бы.. иногда, это происходило в рамках одного уровня, так что местами становилось скучно.
3. Была заявка на погружение, но нет, герои вроде есть, при этом полностью безликие, не цепляет, хотя могло. При чём, если бы продолжительность игры была больше, стало бы только хуже. Видно, что авторы вымучивали и выдавливали из себя хоть какой-то сюжет.. и на этом спасибо.

Из плюсов, игра хорошо состарилась, она мне кажется, сейчас выглядит на голову выше половины шутеров. Как для шутана порадовала физика и сочная картинка, а так же идея с оружием. Игра намекает тебе, что стоит запомнить на какой кнопке, у какого оружия, какой режим стрельбы (они добавляются по мере игры), а ты пытайся не путать эти режимы в разгар боя, при этом успевай менять ""ствол"" под разных противников на подходящий и если помрёшь, сам виноват) Механика рождает много забавных ситуаций, в которых когда тупишь, очень радуешься) Анимации и поведение оружия, выглядит всё замечательно, из оружия приятно не только стрелять, но и просто держать в руках.
В целом и общем, это прекрасный техно-шутер, который Я бы посоветовал к прохождению. Да, ему не хватило истории и проработки, начиная с левел дизайна, заканчивая лором и мотивацией персонажей, но, из недостатков которые Я озвучил, сейчас игры состоят полностью, чего не скажешь о Hard Reset. Приятной игры. | Старый добрый линейный арена-шутер с поиском секретов. Есть сюжет, неплохая графика, без тормозов. Самое то чтобы отдохнуть на пару вечеров.",

Coming from the designer behind [i]The Stanley Parable[/i] and a young developer team, this free little game with a needlessly long name carries a similar pattern of blatant absurdity. Due to the ridiculous amount of probable effort that I'd have to put while writing the whole completion of the title each time, I'll be referring to the game simply as [i]Dr.Langeskov[/i] for the remainder of this review. Now that is settled, let me try doing this properly.

Following the example of [i]The Stanley Parable[/i], it is somewhat hard to write a review to a game that would be better played without knowing anything about it. So, if you'd like to enjoy the full experience, I'd highly recommend to stop reading and give it a try to see it for yourself. Since it already is a freeware, you won't have anything to lose rather than 15 minutes of your time.

Still here? Well then. You've asked for it. Since we've already downloaded the game, we must have intended to actually play it, right? There is one little problem though. As the game starts, we are very apologetically informed that they are unable to let us play since it is a single player game and there is already one person playing it. Apparently we have to wait for the other player to finish the game before trying it ourselves. But since the studio conditions are a bit below excellent - nope, of course there are no safety hazards! What is it you are thinking? - There is a shortage of employees in the whole place due to a recent strike. We are informed that it would all go quite swiftly if we were to help them simulate the game for the player inside. Reluctantly agreeing, we start following - or try to follow, at least - directions of the young director with a mousy voice and a British accent, who dreads that our every single action might end in a catastrophy.

As you can see, this short, 15 minute adventure is a complete parody of a developmental concept. There is no actual game here. Like that the cake was a lie, the game itself is a lie. The whole thing is a smart and somewhat enjoyable conceptual experiment that could invoke some appreciation. Certainly not a masterpiece - and not in the claim of being so anyway - and the humor isn't exceptional, but [i]Dr. Lengeskov[/i] presents you a distraction and a smirk on your face for 15 minutes: a task well done. It might be noteworthy to mention that the expected gameplay is somewhat linear contrary to [i]The Stanley Parable[/i], carrying only one possible ending. The idea is to enjoy the environment, the concept and the reactions you are having around. Very much like any joke.

Throughout your playthrough, you might want to investigate the environment, since there are items around to collect for achievements. Achievements themselves are a bit buggy though. I recommend not using the steam overlay or sending the game to tray since it may block achievements from unlocking. If all else fails, verify cache and they should trigger the next time you are meeting their conditions.

Go ahead. I know that you are already curious. It is not the wittiest kid on the block, but it is here and it is free with certain creative value. Enjoy!

Компьютерные игры, как и любая форма искусства, способны вызвать самые разные эмоции у геймера. Порой чувства бывают диаметрально противоположны, к примеру, большинство мультиплеерных забав способны вызывать одновременно, как любовь, так и ненависть, обзоры на туже «Doty 2» яркий тому пример. И подобно живописи или художественной литературе, игры способны влиять на наше мировоззрение и отношение к жизни. Конечно же, не всё. Конечно же, таких игр даже не большинство, но они встречаются. Порой же, разработчики позволяют себе такую вольность, как «ломание четвертой стены» и где герои/антигерои игры обращаются непосредственно к геймеру. Как правило, это делается в шутливой форме, как это было в «Wither 3» или происходящее вовсе превращается в шутку – «Postal 2», но порой бывают и серьезные беседы, дающие пищу для ума. Одной из таких игр была «Stanley Parable», о которой многие слышали, но не все видели. Что ж, наш сегодняшний гость позволит исправить сие досадное упущение, ведь вышел он из-под руки тех же ребят, что отвечали за «Стэнли», но при этом игра распространяется на бесплатной основе и таким образом каждый сможет приобщится к прекрасному, ну или ужасному, как повезет.

Итак, вы - компьютерная программа. Нет, конечно же, к вам будут обращаться напрямую, как к личности, но суть заключается в том, что вы программа, которая так и норовит дать сбой - потыкать в выключатель, на котором написано большими красными буквами ""Не нажимать"". Подергать закрытые двери, постучать в них ногами и недовольно надуться на неведомого кукловода, который вас туда не пускает. Ну а еще надо обязательно проверить, что можно использовать, а что нельзя, расстроив при этом своего неведомого кукловода, который не наделил нас даже банальнейшей возможностью прыгать, что уж говорить о большем?

Казалось бы, что же в этом особенного? Ведь на Steam'е имеется куча игр, которые так или иначе издеваются над геймером. Что в этой игре такого особенного? А дело тут в том, что всё было подано в шутливой форме, причем столь грамотно, что улыбка не раз и не два посетит лицо. Во всяком случае, меня эта игра заставила улыбаться, за вас все же не поручусь. Она не может похвастаться достаточно большой продолжительностью, а потому проходится куда раньше, чем начинает надоедать. Ну а еще тут есть достижения, которые кажутся легкими, но спешу предупредить - разработчики и этот момент смогли обыграть, оттого так просто вы достижения не получите. Необходимо отключить оверлей в игре и тогда и только тогда можно рассчитывать на заветные ачивменты.

6 из 10 притаившихся тигров | Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist is a short free game.
It takes approximately 15 minutes to finish it.
This game is a nice unique experience and pretty humorous.
During your way through the game you will be led by a voice, like in Stanley Parable.
The voice acting is really enjoyable.
If you have played The Stanley Parable and enjoyed the humour of it you should definitely try Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist.

76561197970698176,411300,ELEX,43.7,"Action, Adventure, RPG",11,"ELEX is one of those rare games that manages to deliver a great experience despite its clunky mechanics and unpolished aspects. While it stumbles in areas like combat, skill design, and it has some dubious story choices, it excels in world-building, character development, and delivering a unique sense of exploration. 

1.  Story, World-Building, and Exploration
One of ELEX's strongest qualities lies in its world and characters rather than its central story. The overarching plot isn't particularly interesting and may not pull you in, but the lore, setting, and characters more than make up for it.
The companions are unique and interesting, each with their quirks and complexities that make them stand out. For example, traveling with Arx is absolutely hilarious as his grumpy personality and comments during conversations and exploration are really out of pocket but come out in a natural and fitting way. Even the NPCs are layered and feel authentic, though many are unapologetically self-serving, but it is fitting as it is a reflection of the apocalyptic world they inhabit.
Unlike many open-world games, ELEX avoids the pitfall of creating a vast, empty and boring map. Locations are varied and distinct, making exploration feel rewarding and natural. The game also encourages and rewards curiosity by hiding supplies, lore-filled notes, or valuable gear in locations off the beaten path. This isn’t a game where you’re mindlessly checking off icons on a map; instead, you’re going to genuinely enjoy exploring each house, factory or dome you come across.
The game’s three factions are another highlight. They’re all radically different, and you’ll probably find reasons to both love and hate them. They’re well fleshed out and I found all of them to provide interesting skills and equipment that shine in their own way. My only complaint here is that the faction choice doesn’t make that much of an impact story-wise besides some extra quests for that specific faction.
 
2. The Gameplay
ELEX doesn’t hold your hand, and this tough-love approach to gameplay is both a strength and a weakness, depending on who you might ask. Personally, I enjoyed it. You begin the game as a weak character, with even basic enemies posing a serious threat to your survival. This difficulty encourages approaches you might’ve not considered in other RPGs. You’ll find yourself using the environment to your advantage, you’ll bait enemies into traps or lure them toward NPCs for help. At times, you might even find yourself running for survival. It’s a tough start, but it makes getting stronger feel so much more rewarding.

3. The Combat
The best word to describe combat: jank. You’ll be dealing with a lot of issues such as:
•	Enemies hitting you from absurd ranges or weird angles.
•	Fighting on slopes (good luck landing a hit on uneven ground).
•	Controls being unresponsive, one frequent example is when you’re drinking a potion and suddenly you can’t turn around, being stuck in an awkward strafing animation.
Ranged combat is better,  but it doesn’t redeem the overall experience. It’s not unplayable, but it’s definitely the weakest part of the game.

4. The Skill System and the UI
The skill system could’ve been so much better. Outside of faction-specific skills, most of the trees are just boring stat boosts or generic utility like lockpicking or skinning animals. It feels like a missed opportunity to add more interesting gameplay choices.
The UI also leaves much to be desired. It’s bland and feels like minimal effort was put into it. Managing menus is a pain, and the trading screen, in particular, is chaotic, lumping most items together into a disorganized mess with the exception of weapons and armors.
 
5. The Cold System
Instead of the usual Good vs. Evil morality system, ELEX uses a Cold System, which measures how emotional or detached your character is. In theory, it sounds cool but it’s kind of a mess. You’re going to be forced to pick options you don’t agree with just to balance your “Cold” level, because it affects outcomes later in the game. It feels forced and takes away from the roleplaying experience.

TLDR
ELEX is janky, clunky, and downright frustrating at times but that’s part of its charm. The world-building, exploration, and characters are great, and even though the game has its flaws, it’s still a pretty nice experience.

In the end I actually enjoyed the game, but there are definitely bugs. Several times I managed to fall out into the environment outside of the game, or the inability to get up after sleeping and had to laod the game.

Verdict: In space, people will hear you scream if you record it on an audio log. Should you do that? *dramatic pause* Nah... *shoots screen* | At long last I finally finished my first run of system shock 2. Admittedly I was disappointed by how short the final final fight was, but the entire game makes up for it in spades :)
This game is a timeless classic and I loved every second I spent in it :)
Also, regardless of whether or not you have arachnophobia, by the time you get through the battle against the many? You will be fearing for your life whenever you hear skittering noises in every other game. | System Shock 2 is a genre defining game, just like its predecessor.

The game follows you (a Soldier) on the Starship vessel called the Von Braun, which got taken over by hostile entities, and you must clear the threat.

Let me start by saying that the beginning is confusing as hell. There are a thousand different skills to choose from, it's not made very clear what is important and even needed. You can easily softlock yourself by putting all your upgrade modules in worthless skills. Hacking and cybernetic is also a absolute must.

The many also works very well as a menacing threat throughout the whole game.

Voice acting is good and fits the setting perfectly, the rest of the sound design is also amazing, hearing threats around the corners works in setting a scary setting. It's depressing atmosphere clings to you until the very end.

What helps the game too is it's replayability you can choose so many different skills and different play styles, which means that you can replay the game over and over again and still find different ways to play the game.

Graphics are dated thats for sure but everything is in a style that works well and adds perfectly to the visual fidelty, every environment is unique and interesting in it's own way.

I like the UI's, also that you can research things and even play minigames in your inventory which are all neat gimmicks that add to the experience. I also feel like the inventory management is a minigame on it's own due to the sheer amount of stuff you can find aboard the ship and your limited inventory space.

The game also makes it very clear what goals to achieve and how to achieve them which definitely helps first timers and doesn't make it to overbearing, but beware there is no hand holding here. Autosaves are also ass, be sure to save often and use multiple saves the first time.

Apart from that and some confusing design language the game is a joy from beginning to end. Learning about what happended on the Von Braun is still as thrilling as it was back in '99. I won't spoil any story since that is definitely it's strong suit.


All in all i can only recommend this game, it is one of my favorite games of all time and paved the way for future immersive sims like Bioshock, prey etc...

The game truly deserves a 10/10 in my book, but it isn't for everyone due to it's quirkyness. | This is a fucking awesome game in nearly every way. The ship you are exploring feels like a real place, with real rooms that once served a real purpose. And there's a very real threat constantly present, wanting to take the proverbial wrench from the monkey (literally). 

This is one of the first games, besides its prequel, that popularized audio logs. However this isn't your AAA Ubisoft ""Audio Log slop"". Hell no. These logs not only give you clues to progression, but they are really interesting to listen to and sometimes very disturbing. And this is coming from someone who previously thought audio logs in games belong next to the logs in the toilet. 

Not everything is all perfect though, this is a flawed game in some ways. There are skills you can level that are straight up worthless (repair), and yeah, I'm one of those that doesn't think the soundtrack entirely fits. It would be fine, and it does give you a kind of ""rat in a maze"" feel that is appropriate, but sometimes you're just listening to logs or plot emails and there's this fucking EDM techno in the background looping endlessly. One of the tracks honestly gets a little aggravating once the fun novelty has worn off.

It's a bit of a shame too because there ARE fantastic ambient tracks (the medical \ Crew quarters track is haunting and I love it). 

This is a must play for imsim fans, or anyone who loves disturbing sci fi shenanigans. Even now, playing for the first time about 25 years since its release, it's easy to see why it inspired so many developers and trends we still see to this day in gaming. | This game is great story, atmosphere, the soundtrack(awesome), the villain/s are fantastic, audio logs are really well done and the combat is quite good. It also runs smoothly on modern machines which i was not expecting, no frame rate drops or frame tears or memory leaks on Win11 and a modern PC so big pluses for that in my opinion.

As a newcomer, I am now incredibly sad there is no system shock 3, i came right after playing system shock 1, this and KOTOR have made me feel empty as both are games that absolutely deserve a proper finish in a trilogy. This game has probably ruined other immersive sims for me especially Bioshock because i'll be playing them again and be like oh my God this from System Shock. I highly recommend both games","System Shock 2 is a classic, and one of the best games ever made."

The environment and atmosphere is done really well and i would of been blown away if i played this when it first came out. The controls took some getting used to but once i understood it I found myself enjoying it for what it was. 
Theirs not that much story but from I've learnt this was the first game to have a proper story told mainly through audio logs something that is still seen in Bioshock and prey etc so i found myself still enjoying it. Though it is quite funny after completing the game you really do see how and where every game after was so heavily inspired. 

The combat was very doom like so i enjoyed it lots of cool weapons. In effect if you don't mind playing older games i would definitely recommend giving this game a try, I'm definitely going to give its famous sequel a try soon. | Its like Doom in space but its a thinking and a strategy game.

На дворе 2025й год и я был благословлён тем, что наконец, прошёл культовый System Shock!

[i] [h2] Это Ш.Е.Д.Е.В.Р! [/h2] [/i]
Не знаю, как там всё срослось в ремэйке 2023 года, но тут атмосфера погружения просто чудовищной глубины!

Да, приходится повозится с унылым управлением, сперва куча всего вокруг непонятно, пока тут разберёшься можно и игру забросить… 

Однако выбравшись из своей лечебной палаты и вырубив трубой пару мед.андроидов остановиться уже нереально! На процесс подсаживаешься как на тяжёлые наркотики, а голос Shodan быстро вызывает привыкание. Пару часов спустя я понял, что с концами подсел на System Shock! И это было прекрасно!

Никто вас тут не ведёт за ручку, никто ничего не разжёвывает. Выживай как хочешь. На вот тебе пару логов. Почитай, на досуге, коли умеешь, может ума разума наберёшься и поймёшь какую мудрость… А так, всё, вали уже! Выживай, мальчик!

Горы трупов по всей цитадели нагоняют ужаса, особенно в свете раскрывающихся историй ещё недавно  живых членов экипажа. Ты как будто карабкаешься по лестнице вымощенной трупами предшественников, которые отчаянно пытались добраться до горла Shodan и перерезать ей шнур питания от уха до уха. Это пугает и притягивает одновременно… 

Игра настолько многогранна, что я лучше просто, отмечу тут хорошие и плохие моменты по памяти, а остальное доверю всем тем, кто не побоится почтенного возраста игры и дерзко полезет перепаивать микросхемы на своём rail gun’е…

[h2] 👍 Плюсы: [/h2]

 💪 + Иммерсивный Сим (даёт глубочайшее погружение в происходящее!)

🤖 + Shodan (вы полюбите харизму этого ИИ…) 😉 

💀 + Атмосфера (я буквально стремался ходить по этой космической цитадели зла, настолько хорошо создатели играют на твоих нервах)

🗡 + Light Rapier (как только я добыл себе оружие Джедая я стал неудержим и наслаждение от убийств стало абсолютным!)

🔊 + Музыка (эта музыка могла бы качать стадионы, без шуток, она нереально хороша!)

[h2] 🤷‍♂ Минусы: [/h2]

🥴 - Управление (нет, тут без поллитра явно не разобраться… ну в какой ещё игре перезарядка назначена на сочетание клавиш Cctrl + Backspace \ или Alt + Backspace?!)

👾 - Бесконечный respawn врагов (да, увы, полностью зачистить этажи не получится)

🤖 - Невнятное подпространство (я пока понял, чего от меня хотят в этом хакерском аду меня раз восемь по полной укачало)

💥 - Неудобно использовать гранаты и аптечки (ну неудобно и всё тут!)

🚧 - Затыки (иногда ты просто не понимаешь, чего от тебя хотят, чтобы пройти дальше)

* Tem um bug que faz a Robin ser casada com o Demétrio... peço que removam
* Não da para trocar soco com o Demétrio
* Não tenho mais vida social mas a fazenda tá em dia | Quando a gente pensa na vida, às vezes ela parece um pouco sem sentido, não é? A gente corre atrás de metas, objetivos e sonhos, mas no fundo, fica a pergunta: ""qual o real propósito disso tudo?"" Albert Camus, um dos maiores filósofos existencialistas, fala exatamente sobre isso. Ele diz que a vida é absurda ou seja, não tem um grande significado pré estabelecido. Mas ao invés de cairmos no desespero ou na frustração, ele propõe uma atitude de revolta e aceitação: continuar vivendo e buscando pequenas razões para seguir em frente, mesmo sabendo que nada vai dar ""a resposta definitiva"" para o sentido da vida.

É aí que >>>Stardew Valley<<< entra de uma maneira muito interessante. No jogo, a fazenda nunca vai ser 100% perfeita. Mesmo depois de mundo trabalho, sempre vai ter mais coisa para fazer. A colheita pode dar certo em um ano, mas em outro nem tanto por conta do clima não ajudar... As dificuldades não param. No entanto, o que Stardew Valley pode nos ensinar, de forma tranquila e até reconfortante, é que a beleza está exatamente nisso: no processo. Cada pequena conquista cada planta cultivada, cada amizade construída... são essas e entre muitas situações que tornam a jornada significativa.

Не рекомендую цей піс оф щіт | It is exactly what it seems like. An X-com style isometric shooter set in the wild west, mixed with urban fantasy elements. It doesn't try to be anything more, or anything less.

The biggest distinction is it's luck mechanic and heavier narrative focus. What it means is that the chances of you shooting someone or getting shot are a lot more easier to predict and wager, while your engagements are a lot more scripted, less randomized. Also, the posse you get are nearly all scripted, so the game is balanced around that as well. It all makes the game feel a lot more fair, but it also makes it way easier to master and complete than regular x-com, so it may not be appealing to the really hardcore players. But for me it was just right. | I would not recommend this game for people who are looking for a thoughtful, Western X-Com game. Hard West is a mixture of table top game and X-Com like fights but there is something off and janky about the game. I have tried multiple times to beat the Retired Demon, about 2 hours of time tonight and the limitations of the came comes front and center.

The game doesn't allow you to have a manual save or even multiple save states so if you go into a battle scenario under prepared you will lose and lose repeatedly. I cannot heal other team mates, and there is a lack of in mission options for recovering health unless you equip multiple before battles. I also have realized that some of the Playing Card abilities are very finicky, like the eating the dead one that I had equipped on my crazy moonshiner which would only randomly work at times. I would be standing on a tile with a dead enemy and I could not eat the flesh and even after swapping around which tile I was on.

The GUI and interface, the controls are exactly like X-Com and similar game but there was even 3 to 4 hours in an apprehension about ""If I Right click vs Left click is it going to back out on what I was going to do?""

I love the weird West genre, and I love most Westerns too, but this game just left me frustrated. When I tried to back out of the section I was in to see if I could go back a few turns on the table top portion it straight  up just restarted all my progress in that chapter.

I just wish that there was more forethought put into certain aspects of the game play mechanics and the way the game flows. But I will say if you want a crazy tough experience, even with the jankiness, give the game a shot. For people who want a game that doesn't have the extreme jank that I experienced, look elsewhere for your Weird West X-Com.",Great game with great tactical scenarios. I also like the dark atmosphere. |

Unfortunately Marmalade Studios, the new owners of the Intellectual Property (IP) for the electronic version haven't extended the licence to existing purchasers, nor have they (as far as I'm aware), offered a discount to encourage us to 'upgrade' to their new version; an attitude that will likely reduce their potential reach and the overall value of that IP.

76561197970698176,420840,BLARP!,0.25,"Casual, Indie",0,"Does it break new ground? Does it innovate and excite? No on both counts. But as a physics exercise, Blarp is fantastic at demonstrating what VR, and more importantly motion controlled VR, can do.

The game is basic, almost painfully so. A psychadelic eyeball called a ""Blarp"" is floating around in a box with you. You can 'attract' it by pulling the trigger of the Vive Bagel Blaster associated with your right hand, and the Blarp will attempt to make sweet, sweet love to your remote. When you stop pulling the trigger, the Blarp continues on its last path and velocity, whether or not your remote is still there. Also of note is that Blarps can not turn on a dime -- more accurately, they can maybe turn on a manhole cover. What this means is that you bull-and-cape it into running into a target floating in the box with you. Upon hitting the target, another Blarp spawns, and now BOTH of those Blarps independently try to track down your Bagel Blaster when you pull the trigger. As you fling these helpless eyeballs into more and more targets, more of their compatriots spawn, attempting to destroy the interloper (your remote) in their midst. You keep going until you ""get Blarped"" (to use the in-game verbiage), i.e. a Blarp runs into your remote.

There are no complex mechanics or systems to learn, just an intrinsic understanding of momentum and spatial awareness. Yet despite the simplicity, the game achieves its goal quite readily -- you realize that there is literally no way to play this game outside of VR. Without the depth perception, you won't be able to determine how far away the Blarps are from your remote, and by extent you'll end up striking out. Without motion controls, you wouldn't be able to 'swing' the Blarps from target to target (although I will readily admit that a PS Move could easily do just this, the only benefit of the Bagel Blasters of the Vive is being able to carefully sneak your way past a Blarp cloud as you gather them up for the next target.)

As a game, aye, it's lacking. But as a $3 demonstrator of VR technology? Yeah, yeah, I think it does the job. | This is like all of my 90s hologram stickers, come to life. Despite buying over $100 worth of VR titles over the weekend to play on my VIVE, the one I keep thinking about the most is Blarp. The sound design is fantastic, and the graphics are so trippy yet on point with a sense that I'm actually in the mentioned hologram space. If you own a VIVE, own this game. Now. | Hands down one of the most magical experiences I've had on the Vive. The feeling of swinging the balls around the room is simply amazing.

The game requires a lot of patience in the later portions of a run, making it frustrating to lose to a simple mistake, and hard to come back to because of this. If the game had some sort of checkpoint system or ""Start playing at level 15, 30, ..."" system in place it would have a lot more replayability.

Regardless, for under 5$, this game is a must buy. | If you have a vive, just stop reading this and buy this game.

I'm struggling to find a con, but I guess it does tend to wrap up your cord.  I also imagine that without at least 2mx2m it would be hard to play, but maybe if you were a skilled rope wranglin' cowboy, you could make do.

BLARP out man! | Perhaps I'm missing some core game mechanic here, but I don't quite see the epic appeal of BLARP! Or, at least, I'm at a loss to explain why so many other reviewers thought it was the cat's pyjamas.

As far as I can tell, there are only two controls (i.e. the right trigger attracts blarps to the wand, left trigger generates a shield), two game mechanics (elastic attraction and shield-based deflection), and one goal (get a blarp to strike the numbered ball).

Sure, the spacey mood music is nice and mellow and the rainbow-coloured visuals sufficiently trippy, but is this really the sort of experience I'd want to: 1, spend lots of time in; or 2, show off to friends, family, and curious passers-by to demonstrate the potential of VR? That would be a firm ""no"" on both counts.

","Blarp is a simple, simple game that is a great example of how VR can be used to create a game that is both fun and challenging."
76561197970698176,422860,Holodance,0.9,"Casual, Indie, Sports",1,"At 71 years old I'm quite certain most other players of this VR game are considerably younger than I am. I just started playing it yesterday. I've logged in 2.2 hours of play so far, gathered 10,200,000 points, and am enjoying it a lot.  I exercise close to 3 hours a day, and this game will now add a bit more to that. Primarily arm exercise of course, but arms need exercise too.

This game is different in that you are not just hitting targets flying at you, you have to use your brain too. You need to quickly determine what type of target is coming and where you need to hit it, and then move your arm in the correct direction to capture that orb and get the points for it. Plus you have very little time to make these determinations. 

Very much recommended for couch potatoes to help keep them from making permanent double indentations in the couch cushions. 

The more I use it, I'm sure the more I will understand. It's pretty user friendly though after you play a few songs. I'm still trying to find out if statistics can be saved for more than one person. Probably not, but it would be a nice feature. 
I've only been playing in the Free section so far, and primarily just racking up points in order to open up all the playing areas as soon as possible. 
Up till now I've been playing mostly AudioShield, Space Pirate Trainer, and PowerBeats. Along with them, I’m sure this game will soon become one of my favorites.

Update -- today is August 2 and when I completed playing Holodance last night I had accumulated 40 million points. It's a bit addictive for me because I'm pretty competitive. I'm not concerned about competing with others, but I do compete with myself. At first I thought a million or two points a day would be OK, but now I don't feel like I'm done until I hit another 10 million point level in a day. Perhaps I'll even understand what ""osu"" means  eventually.

I do have a suggestion of how to get better and better with this game. Play a level of  difficulty above what you are comfortable with. Don't play the easy levels just because you can win there without much effort. Maybe that will make you feel good, but that's all it will do. If you  play above your present skill level, you will push yourself harder. Try not to let it bother you  that your point levels are lower than when you are playing a less difficult level. Who cares? You will be getting more skilled at it at in a shorter period of time. Play for a couple of days at a harder level and then check and see how much easier you can raise your score on the easier level version. 

I'm so impressed with Jashan, the developer of this game. I presented him with several questions and a number of problems I was having while playing the game over the last week, and he answered back on every one of them. And he did so much quicker than I would ever have expected. I was starting to feel a bit guilty by being such a pest with all my questions, but then started to feel like I was actually participating in the further improvement/development of this game by pointing out these problems. | I tried them all out: Audioshield, Soundboxing, Holodance, Beats Fever and Airtone.

I directly need to say Audioshield was the worst of them. 

1.	Airtone (most expensive, great look and gameplay, limited songs) Highly recommended!
2.	Holodance (really really great, nearby nr. 1 and by far nr. 2) Highly recommended!
x (Soundboxing - can not recommand at this time as it is very buggy, uploading beatmaps does not work and virtual keyboard does not work for Oculus users)
3.	Beats Fever 
4.	Audioshield

Audioshield: it did not feel like a rhythm game at all and it had only a few sound-stages. The gameplay was not in sync with the music as the algorithm does not do that well. Every game with predefined beatmaps is far superior. You Tube integration does not help. Gameplay feels often chaotic and shallow.

Soundboxing: Gameplay felt more serious as in Audioshield. It has user made beatmaps and a youtube integration. You can easily create beatmaps to your own favorite songs and share them. It has 12 different show-stages. -- Can not be recommanded atm as uploading beatmaps does not work and the virtual keyboard does not work for Oculus users --

Beats Fever: Good looking environments, 40 songs with predefined beatmaps. Songs are a bit generic, gameplay is okay but does not feel that organic. A bit chaotic at times. 

Holodance: with Osu! integration, great looking, fun gameplay, definitely one of the best. Through Osu integration nearby infinite gameplay. Highly recommended!

Airtone: Best rhythm game out there, if you can life with Japanese pop. It has the best rhythm gameplay of all of them: you have to punch/slap the notes, just holding the stick in the direction is not enough; your punches/slaps make a sound when you hit so you hear the rhythm you are beating (not just a short vibration), the presentation is very beautiful, every song has three difficult levels, all in all very fun and addictive. 25 Tracks included. Highly recommended! | [h1]The good:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Automatic mapping. It's fantastic! It worked really well with everything I threw at at, and the layout of notes doesn't feel random. It's still quite a new feature, but it's seriously promising.
[*]This game has the [i]largest[/i] manually-mapped library out there, at over 15,000 individual songs! Each song has between 1-10 difficulties, and they're all perfectly on-beat. This is largely due to osu! support, an insanely popular pancake rhythm game. It leans towards Japanese culture, but there's plenty of western music too!
[*]Different playstyles! Jashan, the developer, is working on a few completely different ways to play the game. You'll find something to love.
[*]The developer. Jashan is a fantastic, responsive developer who is clearly passionate about this game. You can easily chat directly with him through the game's Discord, or Twitter. Got a problem, or some feedback? Send it directly to him. Seems silly to praise, but it's critical to listen to feedback this early in VR.
[*]Environments! There are many different areas in which you can play, and some of them even have interesting tweaks on gameplay that make the game more hectic or active.
[*]Customisability. I have never played a game in VR that does this to the degree that Holodance does. Everything is adjustable, and whilst it's overwhelming to start with, it's something you appreciate once you've got it set up the way you like it.
[/list]

[h1]The bad:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Visual style. This is certainly subjective, however it's my belief that the game could use some love and care on the design side of things. This feedback is more aimed at the colour scheme and general feel of the game more than the designed environments. To support the sheer level of options that you have here, the menus can feel a bit labyrinthian. They blend into eachother, and it can take a short while to find the setting you're looking for. 
[*]Physical freedom. Again, a personal complaint. You have to be quite precise with your movements, and the plane in which you catch the orbs is thin. I feel like I can only really move during breaks, which takes me out of it a little. This precision however means that it it's quite easy to ""learn"" maps, so practicing one song several times actually feels like progression. Something that other VR rhythm games fail to deliver on.
[/list]

[h1]Feedback for the developer:[/h1]
Jashan, you're a shining beacon in the world of VR developers. You listen to feedback, and act on it quickly. Somehow, even with such a small market right now, you're managing to do all of this and still be productive. It is crystal clear how much you care about this game. Please, continue polishing and improving this game. I want to see this become something amazing. If it means compromising, I hope you do it in a way that still preserves the spirit of what this game was at day one.


[h1]All in all:[/h1]
I highly recommend giving this game an open-minded chance. Go in with the expectation to spend some time perfecting it for your own personal experience. You'll be pleasantly surprised at how much depth this title has! The osu! library is flawlessly integrated and gives you many filters to use to find songs that fit your playstyle. You'll certainly find something you love to do in this game.
If you played this game back when it first came out, play it again. It's vastly different now, and whilst the single player campaign is on hold, the free mode is just phenomenal.

There's no such thing as off-beat mapping in this game. | After seeing some gameplay videos on Youtube, I really wanted to like this game. But after playing Beat Saber for about 2 years and just getting into Synth Riders, I could not find this game enjoyable.

This game probably could have done without the story mode, but it is an interesting idea and it was created before free play mode, which is the only thing that can remotely make anyone want to keep playing is if they like or have played osu.

Pros:
Has access to the osu library. Many many songs to choose from. You may like this game a lot if you play osu.
The game has part of a story mode and I found the dragons charming.
Plenty of environments that are nice to look at.
Different ways to play, catching orbs, slashing orbs, shooting drones.
Lots of options in the menus to customize your gameplay.

Cons:
Practically no tutorial. There is a box to read on the main menu, but it tells you almost nothing about the game.
In all gameplay modes all of the notes can be hit with both hand interchangeably. Makes for dull gameplay.
Lots of options in the menu to the point it was hard to navigate through them.
It appears that you cannot fail songs.
The story mode is unfinished. I found the very 1st level not beginner friendly at all. There is no difficulty to choose from in story mode, only in free play mode. There is an option to unlock later story mode levels automatically, and maybe it is just that this option is broken. I wanted to see if the story got more serious over time, so I picked this environment with burning trees. It seems like only the first 3 areas in the story actually have songs. Although somehow I got a song from the 11th area playing with the menu still open. It started fairly busy, but the notes weren't spaced out much and then later on only would have the occasional 2 notes at a time and was rather boring. Likely an unfinished song and not supposed to be there. This later environments wouldn't deload unless I quit the game. Very buggy. Maybe this only happened because I didn't play through the entire story and skipped ahead, but even so if the developer gives and option to unlock later level to skip ahead, it needs to be tested to make sure the game isn't breaking when it is used.

Understanding that this game was the 1st VR rhythm game, it tries. But Beat Saber and Synth Riders do a much better job and if you want this because it has a shooting mode, get Pistol Whip instead. Only get this if you really like osu or have children who like dragons. You have to high five and fistbump the dragon to continue, it's kind of cute. | I can appreciate it for being one of the original VR dance/rhythm games, but it does not hold up to today when you have much better options. 

You have two options in the game, the original story mode, which is basically where dragons throw colored balls at you. The dragons are really pretty, but it all seems a bit random and out of place and I never really felt like I was ""dancing"".

The second option is a free mode, in which they don't seem to have any songs of their own (the UI is also a confusing mess to navigate). It's more all player made maps, which means you might find something you like if you dig far enough but there seems to be no ranking, so you will have no idea if the map you pick is actually *good* or not. 

Even with some of the expert and expert + maps I played, I didn't really get that dance feeling like you do in something like Audio Trip, Beat Saber, or Synth Riders, unfortunately. 

I appreciate the fact that apparently it supports LIV mixed reality and foot trackers, but unfortunately I could get neither working with this particular game. The avatar in LIV would work, but then after a few seconds of being in the game it would be obscured by black screen. Holodance also could not pick up my foot trackers despite giving them roles in the Steam VR settings.",a bit addicted to this game.

 | I wish you could just drive around and explore without worrying about any of the economic simulation mechanics. I am sure those mechanics appeal to many fans of the game, and there's nothing wrong with them objectively (if anything they seem deep detailed and well-designed), ....but to me, they are just an annoying and cumbersome distraction.

The highways themselves are places i tend to turn off my brain (exception if i decide to not use the GPS to find the destination), however any of the countryside roads or the destination cities are challenging enough to have to keep your head on a swivel, this includes some parking spots. 
The long hauls remind me of my time in minecraft spending hours just holding left click and forwards without actually thinking, however american truck does require a bit more input than that, it gives my brain the same kind of tranquility. 

Besides this already being one of the top tier simulation games, they keep updating and improving the game, this includes the base game areas that started to feel outdated compared to the latest DLC's at one point, but not anymore!

[quote]But that’s not all…[/quote] You can also hire drivers, purchase other trucks and create a big machine which can make you earn a lot of money. At this stage you could also purchase warehouses and expand your business in other cities. Moreover, your driver can increase his level and get experience scores which you could use in different sectors, such as fragile or luxury goods, trafficking length, special transports (e.g. explosive) and rush deliveries.[quote]The degree of difficulty has been raised thanks to more sophisticated roads, above all those which have 2 lanes and where coaster-like rolling or turns make the player change gear, speed up and slow down very often.[/quote] This happens above all when you meet longer trailers than they were before, so that also a veteran of this saga needs some time to get used to the driving of these new means and to park them. Actually, it is possible to choose the difficulty of this latter: normal or expert. In the normal version the maneuvers which are necessary are on the same level of ETS 2, in the expert version it becomes more and more difficult because you are required to park your trailer in little areas and overcome obstacles. ATS is a title in which developers have focused more on quality than on quantity of contents. For those who have experienced ETS 2 this could be a negative point, however the realism takes advantage of it and shows places and situations which are always different. I suggest that both those who experienced its predecessor and those who are neophytes buy this game. I highly recommend this game!

76561197970698176,268500,XCOM® 2,117.95,Strategy,42,"amazing tactical gameplay and challenge. XCOM 2 and WOTC are so different it is like 2 different games which makes replayability even higher. One of my favorite games. I would give 10/10 | After my 3rd attempt, I was able to beat this game, and I didn't really like it. The game is cruel, unreasonably hard and very disrespectful to player. 
At first, the game bombards you with a ton of non-skippable events, missions, messages. While you trying to figure out what's going on, they put on a timer on you with this ""Project Avatar"" thing, and you immediately feel a lot of pressure. Some missions are just crazy difficult, like those for Serpent King and Mad AI factory, and you don't expect this difficulty this early in the game.
Mid-game you finally have a chance to catch some breath and start working on some research, building and engineering, but here's the catch: the moment you get better in the game, the moment you upgrade your weapons and armour, the enemies suddenly become more powerful and armoured. You just don't have a chance to enjoy powerful things that you've made, because they quickly become just what is expected by default.
The end game comes unexpectedly, with a lot of pressure on you. It consists of two consecutive missions with no pause in between. If you got some units damaged in the first mission, you either will have to replace your best units or send them in wounded. The final mission is crazy, the amount of extremely powerful enemies is over the top, and it carries a lot of stress.
Given that the game is flawed with bugs in controls, has dumb battle mechanics that lead to absurd situations and very challenging overall even on lower difficulties, I would not recommend this game. | Le jeu en lui même est ok, War of the Chosen ajoute énormément au gameplay et est un incontournable pour XCOM 2. je vous recommande aussi d'utiliser des mods. Long war of the chosen est vraiment incroyable et ajoute énormément de difficulté. Le jeu peut être un peu frustrant mais n'oubliez pas qu'il est normal de perdre dans ce jeu !
Une pépite de stratégie au tour par tour comme on en fait plus.
 | XCOM2の面白さを語るには、前作にして名作 XCOM: Enemy Unknown (以下XCOM:EU) と比較すると分かりやすいと思う

まず前作のXCOM:EUからあらゆる面で順当に進化しておりボリュームも増した
Steamワークショップ対応でMODも充実と欠点なし！と、損は無いのでセール時にはぜひ買ってプレイしてほしい

以上を大前提とした上で、そう⋯700時間以上もプレイ（最高難易度を最小部隊人数でクリア済）した上で私個人の見解を言わせてもらうと
XCOM:EUよりもゲーム性（ゲームとしての楽しさの意）は落ちてしまったと感じる
XCOM:EUはXCOM2よりも飽きの来る要素が多いはずなのに⋯だ！
※EUでは敵の配置が一部完全固定だったり⋯etc

繰り返し遊ぶゲームとしてみるとXCOM2の方が優秀なはずである
ではなぜ私はXCOM:EUの方がゲーム性が高いと言えるのか？
XCOM:EUのゲーム性はまるでパワプロなのだ
パワプロもメインイベントは決まった日に起こるはずなのに、何度もプレイしても楽しい

XCOM:EUではストーリーの進行と、ミッションが適切な間隔で詰まっており
兵士の計画的な育成（＝ビルドを組む楽しさ）と、時間制限（＝敵の更新／強化）
のバランスがすごい良かったのだ
そしてランダム性が少ないことが→上手くなれば、あらゆる要素を縛っても戦術で勝てる
など良い方向に働いたりした

一方でXCOM2では、多くの追加要素により楽しさも増したが、
その分ストーリーとミッションの関連性が薄れ、またタイムリミット枠の選ばれし者たちの介入は、
戦闘を長引かせる良くない要素の一つだと思う
選ばれし者自体はすごく面白いのだが、3人は多い！ゲームのかさ増しになってしまってる

ストーリーとレジスタンスの尻拭いを交互にやらされるのも間延びする原因だ
XCOM:EUでは助ける国と、見捨てる国の切り分けも緊張感を煽る良いスパイスだった
XCOM:EUでの上手くなるは「ゲームオーバーにならなければ見捨てて/切り捨ててOK」だった
XCOM2では上手くなると「滅亡カウンターがやばくなってきたから、そろそろ助けに行くか～」と、どの難易度でもなった
侵略されてXCOM:EUより悲惨なはずなのに、なんか緊張感にかけるのである
追加要素をプレイさせるために、滅亡までの時間にどうしても猶予が出来てしまったためだ
この点がゲーム性がXCOM:EUより落ちてしまったと感じる部分だ

難易度が上がると、どんどん無駄を減らすプレイングが重要で、駆け抜けるようなゲームプレイ感になるXCOM:EUと
研究や勢力や選ばれし者など、たくさんの要素からどっしり構えて戦略を練っていくXCOM2とプレイ感が違う
そしてたまたまXCOM:EUの方が私に合っていただけなのかも知れない

色々言ったがXCOM2のMODでの拡張性と、それに伴う豊富なキャラクリは本当に最高なので
みんなもお気に入りのキャラを作ってプレイしよう！
キャラに愛着が湧けば湧くほど、そのキャラが死んだ時に楽しいぞｗ | 2015 I graduated University. 2016 the game came out. For many years, I didn't have the time to play the game, or would like to spend 90 dollars on the game title at the time. 9 years later, it's 5 bucks on discounts, and it plays just as well as when i was continuing from 2015 from XCOM 1. Highly recommend this game to be played by people.

the premise of the game's puzzles is simple. draw line from start to finish. simple enough.

then, the game adds a few small mechanics that transforms the difficulty from dollar store coloring book to interviewing for a coding job at Google. [i] The Witness [/i] is the [i] Dark Souls [/i] of maze puzzles.

[i] The Witness [/i] is the first game i have ever played where i have sat in my desk, staring at the same exact puzzle for 2 1/2 hours in the middle of the night with no solution, asking myself ""what do the symbols [b] mean [/b] mason?"" over and over again. 

i covered my hands and felt tears rolling down my eyes as i question my existence, not because of the impossible task laid before me, but because of all the philosophical quotes questioning society and reality scattered throughout the island

as i wipe the tears away, i realize the puzzle has permanently burned into my frontal lobe and the only clear solution i can come up with is to get a lobotomy [spoiler] which triggers the third ending that even the walkthroughs online haven't found yet. [/spoiler]

once you play the game and finish it, the world will never look as it were again. you will see the puzzles. you must [i] solve [/i] | The Witness é um dos jogos de puzzle mais geniais que eu já joguei, senão o mais genial. Seu design é praticamente perfeito, e ele frequentemente oferece aos jogadores alguns dos momentos de descoberta e admiração mais gratificantes que terão em qualquer jogo - isso se o jogador estiver disposto a aceitar o seu desafio e se esforçar para chegar neles. Esse não é um jogo para todos: ele é quase completamente desprovido de narrativa, diálogo ou até mesmo de trilha sonora, não possui tutoriais escritos explícitos e é focado exclusivamente em sua mecânica principal de resolver quebra-cabeças de ""labirinto"". Mas para o público específico que ele agrada, essa é uma experiência imperdível.

A ilha de The Witness é um mundo aberto enorme completamente recheado de puzzles, com o jogo possuindo mais de 500 telas para serem resolvidas. Enquanto isso pode parecer entediante, na minha experiência (surpreendentemente) não podia ser mais longe da verdade: a ilha possui 11 áreas principais distintas, cada uma com suas ""mecânicas"" e regras próprias que devem ser aprendidas para prosseguir, e esse conhecimento adquirido vai te ajudar a passar por lugares específicos em outras partes da ilha. A forma que você vai descobrindo como essas mecânicas funcionam e como o jogo encontra diferentes maneiras de relacionar os puzzles uns com os outros e com o mundo ao seu redor nunca deixa de impressionar. Sua progressão é baseada em conhecimento adquirido, então jogar sabendo o mínimo possível é essencial.

Esse jogo tem várias reputações diferentes, e eu queria endereçar algumas das negativas. Uma delas é a de que ele é um jogo impossivelmente difícil, ou que possui puzzles que exigem coisas absurdas do jogador - eu mesmo estava receoso há anos de começar o jogo por receio disso. Por sorte, posso dizer que terminar The Witness não é nada impossível, inclusive nem é necessário terminar todas as áreas e resolver todos os quebra-cabeças para chegar em sua conclusão. É uma experiência que exige atenção e esforço do jogador, mas que é longe de ser impossível. Agora, se você quiser fazer 100% dele, aí sim existem alguns pontos nos quais talvez seja necessário ir atrás de pistas ou de um guia, mas eu altamente recomendo tentar fazer o máximo possível dele sem ajuda externa, realmente vale a pena.

Sua segunda reputação negativa, um pouco mais difícil de argumentar, é a de que ele é um projeto pretensioso, sendo que essa é uma crítica altamente subjetiva. Essa visão vem do fato do jogo ser repleto de audiologs com citações de diferentes cientistas, filósofos e poetas sobre assuntos como arte, religião e a procura de significado, porém acho importante ressaltar que todo esse aspecto do jogo é quase completamente opcional, você consegue terminar ele sem nunca escutar um audiolog sequer. Eu escutei todos por querer encontrar tudo que o jogo tinha a oferecer e, apesar de pessoalmente não ter me conectado muito com essa parte do jogo, ainda assim teve alguns trechos que me comoveram. Eu não acho que é errado o jogo ter essa ambição artística e se ver e se portar como um projeto de arte, e eu acho que é uma adição que se casa muito bem com o resto da experiência: os quebra-cabeças e a ilha como um todo são sobre expandir sua perspectiva e ver significado onde antes não havia, e essas diferentes perspectivas sobre assuntos que os audiologs conferem são apenas uma outra extensão disso.

De fato, eu tive muitos poucos problemas com o jogo, o maior deles sendo que existem aspectos envolvendo som e cores que podem dificultar pessoas com problemas de audição ou com algum grau de daltonismo de terminarem o jogo sem o uso de um guia - eu mesmo tive que ir atrás de ajuda em uma determinada parte por conta disso. Eu também cheguei num ponto que achei que a ilha tinha conteúdo demais e desejei que o jogo acabasse mais cedo, mas em retrospectiva isso foi uma falha minha em querer terminar o jogo o mais rápido possível, essa é uma experiência mais contemplativa e feita pra ser jogada ao longo de um período maior de tempo.

Eu recomendo muito The Witness para qualquer um que se interessou pelo que eu descrevi aqui, ou que é fã de aspectos mais filosóficos e artísticos em jogos, e considero uma experiência obrigatória para qualquer fã de jogos de puzzle - podem jogar sem medo que realmente vale muito a pena. | The Witness is a puzzle and exploration game that gives no clear direction or instructions. It requires you to sit with a lot of puzzles and simply take the time to view things from alternate perspectives as you stare into reflections, listen, look at things in different lighting and angles, and try to create new ways of paying witness to the world around you. Ultimately, I think games like this make me realize that I'm not as into puzzle games that aren't directly connected to a tangible story as I thought. The secret ending gives another level of depth, forcing you to see those puzzle patterns experienced in the game, in every part of the environment of the game even where you might not have expected them to be or even externally even in real life. It's a gorgeous way of creating madness as you analyze the world around you a little more through fresh eyes. 5/10 | 就是看你能不能对上作者的脑回路，没有地图，没有传送，迷路了要么就是从头再来，要么就是从中间跳了不知道多少关，接着深深地陷入哲学三问中，最后用一句饱含感情的脏话结束这段难忘的冒险
作者一门心思让我猜他那些无聊的想法，而我的回答是：不，我完全没兴趣知道你的脑袋瓜是怎么构成的 | 极其硬核的解谜类游戏，在一笔画的基础上用众多图形与机制打造了数百个谜题，它们都无比精妙绝伦，但无一例外上手很难
而且它的引导性很差，甚至是差到极点，比如我吧，刚出樱花树林就走到了小镇，而谜题难度相当于刚刚读一年级就去考中考
但是，极差的引导性换来的是无比的沉浸感，在这个小岛上只有你一个人和这些精巧的谜题，就像孤身一人在半夜的卢浮宫徘徊，细致地端详每一件艺术品
或许有时有些谜题很难，无法一下解决，导致卡住了流程，那你也可以放一放，去看看别的谜题，可能看着看着就想出来了；你也可以先放下它，回到生活中来，等你重拾信心再去打开它，毕竟，卢浮宫的艺术品对我们而言并不比家里的柴米油盐更有价值
总之，若是抛开引导性和上手难度不谈，它是绝对的艺术品；当然，说话要全面，不过在我这里，它瑕不掩瑜，我仍然为它颠倒（仅个人观点）

El nivel de concentración que tienes a la hora de jugar este juego va subiendo a medida de que hordas de lobos van aproximándose a tu cerdito con suma rapidez. A veces olvido que uno de ellos tira una de sus hachas y me cuesta esquivarlo. Es de acuerdo al manejo y cómo lo vayas memorizando cada uno de los movimientos conducidos por los bots. 

Los combos de golpes son brutales y mortales para cada uno de estos enemigos, deberás ir practicando el manejo de los mandos de control para quitarte a todos estos bichos de encima lo más rápido que puedas.

Hidden Folks é um joguinho tranquilo e fofo para relaxar (ou não), onde se trata apenas de encontrar elementos num ambiente feito a mão com animações engraçadinhas. Sem mais e cumpre perfeitamente o que propõe! Sem falar que as animações sonoras combinam totalmente com o resto.

76561197970698176,436280,Unknown,0.0,,0,"This is a nice version of Sudoku, with interesting variations. 

What I like: Positives are a range of achievements to that give an additional goal to game-play, some useful power-ups that let you play the way you want to, a nice look and feel to the artwork and an easy to use interface on PC.  I particularly like the variation with coloured blocks overlayed across the grids, so you need to take an extra set of boundaries into account. On the most part, its enjoyable to play.

What I dont like: The more advanced levels have overlapping grids. These are too large to be displayed on the screen at once,  and you need to click & drag the screen to see the grids. I also find these grids hard to complete without the power-up that pencils in the possible options. It's a bit hard to describe. Instead of a traditional grid of 3 x 3 boxes, these give the player two 'overlapping; puzzles that share some grids where the puzzles overlap, so you may have a grid of say 5 boxes x 3 boxes through the middle. Logically, each block of 3 boxes should have numbers 1 to 9 in them. Yet in Sudoku Quest, you can have the same number appear twice in a block of 3 - depending on where the game is drawing the boundary of each of the overlapping puzzles. Baffling! I find it irritating to fail the game when it's unclear that in one set of rows, the numbers are independent from the ones in the next box, yet in another game, they are not. 

There are other minor issues, already mentioned in reviews. The sound is not great, and the power-ups are not explained on screen so you keep having to refer back to the user guide to remember what they do until you've played a bit. 

Final verdict: A nice version of Sudoku, and for the price I'm willing to forgive a few irritations. | Sudoku Quest подойдет как новичкам, так и опытным мастерам судоку. В игре есть различные подсказки, которыми можно воспользоваться по желанию. В режиме приключения с одного уровня на другой попадаешь после заполнения определенных полей (отмеченных крестом). На ошибку всего 10 раз (жизней, если хотите). Быстрое прохождение на следующий уровень не обязательно - после выполнения условий можно остаться и закончить головоломку полностью. Пользовательский режим, соответственно, настраиватеся по вкусу (и по количеству допустимых ошибок в т.ч.).

Общие впечатления: 
+ веселее с дополнительными правилами, режимом приключений и достижениями
+ дополнительная сложность (варианты с большим полем и цветными, неравномерными ячейками)
+ не надо тратить бумагу
+ бесконечно
- не возьмешь с собой (разве что с ноутбуком)
Очаровательный енот и милые рыбки как бонус.


Советы по игре (не настоятельные, конечно, но по доброте душевной):

1. Пользуйтесь мышкой только как курсором - не нажимайте кнопки. Поясняю. Внизу есть числа от 1 до 9, соответственно, которые ""запоминают"" последный введенный номер на поле. Если выбрать пустую ячейку левым кликом (пока одна из цифр активна), то в ней появится это число. Не сбросили последний выбор - сделали ошибку. Поэтому, проще не кликать.

2. Большие поля можно двигать. Да, это было совсем не очевидно по-началу, и по краям чисел приходилось догадываться что там на самом деле. А ларчик просто открывался: зажимается правая кнопка мыши (в стороне от чисел, от греха подальше) и тянется в нужную сторону. Вуаля. | This is a decent Sudoku game. You've got to be careful on adventure mode, as your tenth incorrect guess means you loe and have to restart. If you try to solve the puzzles quickly, this means if you press a few wrong keys (say there's a cold day and your fingers lock up a bit), that's it.

There's a number of things to help you, if you need the help. Those powerups could have been improved a lot, especially if mousing over them told you what they actually did!

I notice some comments about stability, but the game has been very stable for me so I believe any issues were resolved.

Overall I recommend this game. | Divided on this game really, I'm a fan of sudoku, so played quite abit of sudoku games. Puzzles here are abit on easy side (got to level 8 sofar, they probably get harder.) Lost most of my lives to controls, which is were the main annoyances lie. They don't explain much in controls, right click can move you about to see on the multi-board, gotta be careful on note taking vs entering to not accidently put in wrong number, and sofar I hit two boards that have multple answers but game takes a life if you don't enter the one it wants. And sofar havn't seen a way to recover life so that looks to be a major annoyance since losing all lives puts you back at level 1. 
Getting use to controls, if it wern't for the multiple anwser but you lose a life if you guess wrong I'd probably drift into the recomend area but with annoyances for lovers of sudoku . | me resulta bastante incompleto para ser un sudoku y los numeros tienen una fuente y colores que no te dejan ver bien. Pense que iba a ser como el Freecell Quest (Que esta tremendo) pero no me gusto este.

  Igualmente se nota el empeño, ojala que mas gente lo puedo probar, seguro a varios les va a gustar.","The game is a nice variation of Sudoku, with interesting variations. The difficulty is a bit a bit slow, but it's a nice game."

Este título no reinventa la rueda en ningún momento, pero demuestra que se hizo con corazón y con buenas ideas. 👌

 | I don't dislike this game, but it's pretty repetitive and the plot isn't strong enough to support the tedium of the combat. The graphics, which were charming at first, got uglier the longer I played it, too. I estimate I'm about 2/3 of the way through the game right now, and I'll still finish it, because it's not insufferable to play. The one praise I can give it is the way you level up your equipment, which is more akin to Secrets of Mana than most RPGs, so instead of buying new gear with different stats, you just make the same gear stronger over time. It's not my favorite way of doing things (I like buying new gear, simulated capitalism gives me such a dopamine hit), but it's at least something that makes Ara Fell stand out, and I like that. Honestly, I think it could thrive if it were more like Secrets of Mana in that it's a party-based game that ISN'T turn-based, since most of the boring parts deal with the combat mechanics.

All that being said, though, I bought Ara Fell for like a buck by completing the RPG Bundle, and I'm not going to say that it's not worth that little. As of writing this, though, it's on sale for $6 and I think that's too high for it. But if you just LOVE pixel graphic RPGs, you could probably do worse. Probably. | You can just feel the love and effort that went into everything with this title. Outstanding title that every fan of turnbased RPGs should try once! | I really enjoyed this one. 
It is a retro classical JRPG style of game. Reminds me of those early Final Fantasies.
Game has a nice story and there is  exactly the right amount of text messages (not too much). 
Main Characters are very likable. 
Pixel art is nice, a good variety of enemies. Large map. And this is a rare example where crafting done so easy and it is a huge part of the game. 
Main Music Theme is also awesome. there is just a little choice of music and sound effects. Quality is good, but just getting too repetitive. 
Also there are few stages where grinding is almost impossible to avoid. 
Other than that it is an easy game to recommend. | There are a lot of reasons to like this cute little RPG, but IMO the soundtrack really stands out. It's complex and rich and varied, moreso than I'd expect from any simple, low-budget game like this.","It's a classic, but it's not a classic."

The Waterbears are so cute you can spend hours just tickling their bellies and playing with them! The puzzles get more challenging as you go and its fun to build the pipes like legos. I only wish there were more levels to play! Fun for all ages and even the most manly man won't be able to resist this much cuteness! | Great game for kids!  My four year old likes doing all the puzzles even though some are a little hard for her. | Fun and enjoyable 3D puzzle game. It is a great game for kids, but older ages can enjoy it also. It starts very easy, but it builds in complexity. | It's a nice little game, but terribly short. I got to 100% completion in 3 hours. Given that you're unlikely to see more than a few hours out of the game, it's hard to recommend unless it's heavily discounted, or part of a bundle.

It's also really easy. It's about 50% tutorial puzzles, 40% super-easy puzzles that just require the obvious application of the tools you've learned, and about 10% puzzles that require real thought. 

That said, it's a nice little intro to VR that's more than a tech demo. It requires a Room Scale setup, since you have to walk around the puzzles and sometimes peer at them from odd angles, and you manipulate the puzzle pieces by picking them up, and possibly rotating your wrist before placing them.

The basic mechanic is routing colored water stream to the appropriate goals (the ""water bears"" of the correct color). There are stream splitters, color mixers, color splitters, and color filters. The handful of challenging puzzles have severe restrictions on how many pieces of each type you can use, which can prevent the brute-force, obvious solutions. Sometimes you'll do things like mix and split colors multiple times to get the streams where they need to go. | Water Bears VR is a polished and easy to get into VR game. The VR environment is wonderfully bright and colorful, don't let the cartoony-style fool you, this game is immersive. The puzzles are fun and there are enough things to warrant the $9.99 USD.

The game most closely resembles [b]Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker[/b] in terms of the action being centered around a winding blocky mountain you have to traverse around. With the added VR it makes Water Bears VR entertaining and not invasive, a really good place to start with VR.

The puzzle difficulty is quite basic at first and then starts to ramp up with different pipe types and needing to mix colors together for certain Water Bears. 

The biggest downfall of the game is its 3m x 3m room requirement. I didn't have enough room (about 2.6m x 2.8) and it still worked just fine so I'm not sure what the need for all that space is (you don't even use most of the edge space).


[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list]
    [*]Great aesthetics to experience in VR
    [*]Fun puzzles akin to Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker
    [*]Cute interactions with the Water Bears gives added VR depth.

    [*]Perfect for demoing VR in a non-invasive and interactive way.

I honestly could not see how they could improve on the 3D experience. The depth and scaling of the scenes really make it pop, and it gives a quite beautiful landscape (think James Cameron Avatar fluorescent night scene type coloring and style). I received almost 0 ill effects from this game (an 8 hours session in half life 2 gives me a pretty bad headache). The game is fun and you can kill time in it pretty quickly without even realizing.  It’s also nice that they allow you to control yourself with both your headset and a keyboard, as they give completely different experiences.

However, the game definitely needs some tweaking in a few areas.
#1 The random generators can be completely unfair. I once made a perfect run on a track in hard mode, and still lost 30 seconds. Kind of ruins the fun of a game when you are constantly put in unwinnable scenarios.
#2 Starting in hard mode, you get a bowling ball type obstacle. This obstacle can also make the game completely unfair. For example, you’re coming up on a 5-protein chain, but have the bowling balls before it. They are not likely to make it through to the red walls. I cannot find a sure way to hit the balls to guarantee at least 1 will get through.
#3 Sometimes the vertical climbs can be just a bit too steep, and the red walls come up so quickly, there is literally no time to make a guaranteed dodge, leaving it up to luck.

Although, I’m sure these problems can be fixed without having to make any large changes to the codebase, so I expect the authors will be able to get this right some point soon (“A Story About My Uncle” being a great example of early-access developers listening to the fans on gameplay tweaking :-) ). Oh. And achievements are always nice ;-) | Very neat graphics and smooth movement perception, it's a great short game even without VR gear.

I really wish there was a ""recommend, but"" or ""almost/kind of recommend"" option. Much about this game is awesome (one might say fantastic), but the level designs, at least up to level 10b, were kind of repetitive (more on that in a bit). (I played on an oculus rift)

The basic premise is that you have to use sticks and wheels to build a widget to get a pink glowy thing into a pink glowy area (maybe more pieces later? I played the first 10 levels so far). Things are attached at joints 

Pros: 
 - You can configure the building area. Your building area has a floor with adjustable height and a size - you could drag it to fill up your room, or (as I did) make it so that you're essentially building on a desk in front of you). This is awesome and works well. I wish you could adjust this on the fly (zoom in/out/rotate the world to get a different angle sort of thing), but that's not really necessary and it is very well done.

- Basic mechanics are great. You can build things, they act as they should, and can do cool things.

- The controls are great and mostly intuitive. Sometimes if you have a bunch of things joined together and need to break a specific joint, it can be annoying, but over all they're great.

- Visually and audibly (aurally?) pleasant and relaxing and immersive. I mentioned I made the playing field into a desk - I did try to rest my elbow on it once and felt stupid. 

- No VR pukiness (for me, at least) - I plan on using it as start when I show off my VR headset from now on. I suspect this is because there is no movement in game that is not also movement in real life. I do tend to turn off comfort effects (ie teleporty movement) in VR games, and get used to it after a while, so take this as you will.

Cons: 

The only con so far, though it's kind of a big one, is that (again, at least up to level 10b), the obvious solutions were nearly all the same: build a car.

I don't remember the exact order, but my play experience was something like this: goal straight ahead, so build a car. That's fine, intro level, getting you used to how it works. Oh hey, goal straight ahead but in the air - so build a tall car. Goal ahead and to the side, with a wall so you can't drive into but can drive by it: build a car but now hang ball off one side, balanced by weights on the other. That was kind of cool, actually, but then there's the next level: two balls into two goals, both straight ahead: build two cars. Oh hey, something different: build a tower with a spiny thing that'll knock the ball off a pedestal and into the goal. Next level: build the same car with the ball hanging from the side from the first time, but with one tiny modification,

It got to the point where for one level the obvious solution was build a medium tall car, but I was tired of if, so I built a short car and a medium tall bridge for it to drive on. But then that was kind of finicky (though it would have worked eventually), so I pushed the bridge aside and made the medium car in hopes that the next level would be interesting. The next level: build a car.

That's when I stopped and wrote this review. Occasionally the car would push something over. Once the ball couldn't be attached to any objects, so I built a cage, put the ball in the cage - and attached the cage to a car. But so many of the levels were just build a car.

At some point the game gave me a new piece that would stop joints from rotating, which I used a few times. Maybe it gives more pieces later (I really enjoyed the charged particle canon things you could make in the 2d version, dunno if there's charges later on or not. The fact that I built the same car so many times might be slightly less annoying if you could paste in cars you made before, but if you can I don't know how - you can save contraptions by putting on a helmet (think opening a menu) and then dragging them to a shelf. But if you drag from the shelf to a new level, it opens the old level rather than inserting your contraption into the current level.

Again, many things about this game are awesome, and I intend to use it as a light intro to VR because of the general pleasantness, lack of pukiness, and interactability. But after building slightly different cars for something like 80% of the first 10+ levels within an hour, I had to turn it off. I'll probably fire it back up in a couple days or a week in the hopes of finding different levels, or maybe I'll just impose a personal no car rule and see how far I can get. There's potential there. 

Game has great bones. But the levels... | Game feels broken. There is no menu's despite the manual saying to put on a hat? There is no hat? Buttons don't do anything except grab and stop/play. . It feels like something is off or not working. I have an oculus rift which is stated as compatible.. but I can't access options, settings, level select so i can skip starting over each time the game starts. A menu did pop up randomly once and it was the most confusing thing. Didn't make any sense., Can't recommend this sadly. Fun creative game from what I played tho. | 4/10
This game is infuriating. I want to love it and have to advise people to stay away. The controls just don't make an ounce of sense. 
1) I couldn't do something, checked online and found a bunch of stuff ""hidden"" that you could use. What?!!??!
2) I have frustratingly zoomed out. Couldn't find a way to zoom back in again. Pressed all of the buttons. Nothing worked. Restarted the game and found that I am still zoomed out. It looks like I will have to continue playing a mile away from where I should be! ***What?!?!?!?!

I can't recommend this. The developers have come up with a great idea, but haven't paid the slightest attention to the basics of game development, and as such, this is unplayable. 

What a shame! | If you use Windows Mixed Reality, be cautious in buying this! Be sure to test it out within 14 days.  I could not get this game to work with my Windows Mixed Reality controllers at all. The controllers annoyingly buzzed all the time, the space didn't scale properly and things moved AWAY when I tried to pick them up or touch them. The controllers jumped around in the space and nothing worked right. Exiting the game my controllers still were messed up. Unfortunately I spent 20 days working on it and didn't realize refunds must be within 14 days, so I am stuck with a broken game. Maybe someday it will be updated to fix this issue, but I don't believe I am the only one. | A wonderful game to put your imagination to good use! 
The goal of the game is to throw particular items into the black hole, but you have to create a tool to carry the item to the goal by yourself. The initial level gives you a Tutorial about how to make a small car with sticks, wheels and the target ball. Follow the instruction to put the materials in the right place. You can also change the size of the materials to fit your own design, stages went harder and harder, and that is the time for you to imagine freely!
Meanwhile, the developers thought about the balance problem. Every parts have its own weight, the assembled parts lose balance when one side is heavier than another. So elaborate isn’t it?
A highly free game in general, all parts can be connected with others, you can create whatever you what.

画質なんて気にしないポリポリのグラフィックですが、おかげでわりと動作が軽いし、代わりに受話器やらホチキスやらコンロやら工具やら一つ一つの小物のギミックが満載で、非リアルな表現なんて気にならないほど世界観にハマれます。画質云々では表現できない妙なリアリティがある。

ギャグ要素に振り切ったギミックも楽しい。コンビニに置いてある「なんでも大きくする装置」とか、レジのボタンに「ランダム価格」「会計２倍」みたいなボタンがあったりとか。

纸片卡牌风格还是比较喜欢的。 | 很棒的一款遊戲  這年頭 會做遊戲的人沒經費  有經費的都是群智障做一堆花頻垃圾遊戲 | After literally thousands of hours spent in Action isometric RPG's (and others) like Diablo (mostly - like 3k+ h easily :P) , Path of Exile, Titan Quest, Champions of Norath (and Return to arms) - and so on - been there, love it, seen'em - kill'em all. 

This one however didn't attract me with graphic at all, yet I thought - let's give it a chance - sometimes those smaller productions have great climate - mood going along with us on adventures.

And It happened!
Great - just great at it's soothing and deeply relaxing yet perfectly paced at it's difficult march through the hell spawns :D

Now some feedback for developers;
- I played on standard difficulty for good couple of hours without dying once on rather fast route through the enemies (all 100% clear) - quite satisfying with the loot - especially how rarely better items drops - great! yet to this rather calming game I would either put some dis-balanced combat more often forcing us to retreat or push forward instead of clearing the rooms one by one. (at least in the first few hours)
- Second and last issue - in my personal opinion is the graphic - great idea for the paper figures and setting - yet after the great success I hope You will achieve quite soon - I hope for ""real"" 3D included with some stunning and eye catching visuals to back up this already great game's core. | This is a game that comes from the mind of a mobile developer. One of its selling points is the option to have a short play session—an issue that often is crucial for mobile, but hardly relevant for a PC gamer. The control scheme also feels like it was made for a touch screen. There are many mini-games that boil down to grabbing things floating on the screen. To heal poison, you have to click the bottom left with your cursor, even though normally you keep it to the center of the screen—an idea that would be handy of the game was controlled with your fingers via a mobile device, but doesn't translate well to PC.

A lot of its other elements feel clunky as well. While you can instantly teleport to the end of a dungeon when it's 100% clear, looking for that one pesky pile of gold you've missed means backtracking—excruciatngly slow backtracking. And pray that your final enemy isn't a gargoyle or a ghost: both can hide and must attack first... or ignore you, making you run past them a dozen times, groaning.

As for the presentation, I'm pretty sure that Deckard Cain voice is borderline copyright infringement. [i]Book of Demons[/i] also borrows heavily from [i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] with its combination of stylized visuals and gritty narration.

Does it all mean that the game is bad? No. It's all right. The treadmill does its job, injecting you with satisfaction via a steady stream of achievements and other small rewards. The idea of a small-budget simple Diablo-like is laudable, and you get enough fun for the price.

I do, however, feel that the 'Overwhelmingly positive' rating gives the wrong impression of [i]Book of Demons[/i] being some sort of a hidden gem.

It's not. It's just all right. | I like the concept but unfortunately the game just isn't very fun. It is extremely repetitive, which is fine if the gameplay is fun.

　　以上是游戏介绍里的其中一句话，请注意，他说的是真的，但不是体现在喜欢冲入怪堆瞬间被砸成肉块的队友身上，而是体现在每一个敌人身上。
　　在挑战了这么久的暗影难度后，我打个结论，跳跳怪和投矛怪是这游戏的两大硬门槛，是最基本的底层逻辑，它们俩决定了所有冒险家的坟墓里该放几块尸体，能从任意角度击中你的跳跳怪不亚于顶级乒乓球手帝国破坏龙，可在不可思议的角度击中对方，而暗影难度的投矛怪的空中投矛已出神入化，堪比丹麦神弓拉尔斯，正射，斜射，俯射，上射，屏幕外远狙，出手之果断，准头之绝佳，已经把每一个反应力低于猫科动物的冒险家全部射到墙上成为制作人的饭后笑谈。

下面说点有用的吧：
　　近战很危险，但是仍然很有用，近战削韧高，可以打断所有敌人的攻击，先出手就没有人能跟你拼刀，所有慢速武器都不要用，还有，不要用空中下刺。
　　不要和敌人站同一高度的平台上，如果一个平台很长，那么千万不要逗留在上面，否则远处活动的敌人会开始狙你，观察地形很重要，大部分时候占领高地来一个劈一个，就赢了90%，以及，不要用空中下刺。
　　跳跳怪能射就射，射不到就让它飞到身后去不要管它了，千万不要和它纠缠，对了，不要用空中下刺。
　　会弹反的红大哥，和他对着冲就可以，会直接冲到他背后，他刚好劈不到，你弄他屁股就行了，大部分怪都可以对冲，记住，不要用空中下刺。
　　当你拿到可以吸血的剑时，你就精神上完蛋了，你会为了贪每一滴吸血而放弃使弓只用近战，这恰恰令你的死亡率提高了200%，我忘记说什么了吗，不要用空中下刺。
　　一开始我还认为，装备是有好有坏的，道具是有神有烂的，玩到最后终于发现，什么装备都是辅助手段，反应力才是这个游戏的基础需求，你一身神装，没有反应力，躲不开一根平平无奇的投矛，你就挂墙上了。

Each run is unique, as players encounter randomly generated levels filled with traps, enemies, and power-ups that can either aid or hinder your progress. The charm of Caveblazers lies in its dynamic gameplay, colorful graphics, and a whimsical atmosphere that keeps players coming back for more.

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Rage-Inducing Moments[/b]: Now, to be honest, this point is quite personal, but Caveblazers can be unforgivingly rage-inducing at times. The combination of tricky platforming, challenging enemies, and the rogue-like nature of the game means that one wrong move can lead to a swift demise. This can be frustrating, especially during runs where you've gathered a significant amount of loot. While the challenge is part of the fun, it can sometimes tip the scales into sheer irritation, particularly for those who may not enjoy punishing gameplay.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
In conclusion, Caveblazers is a delightful roguelike platformer that offers a unique blend of addictive gameplay, charming character customization, and multiplayer fun.

The inventory system of storing things around your body works well, the bow placement is slightly odd though.

Le cast des spells est étrange, pas de cooldown apparent, difficile de savoir si on peut incanter à la main plus rapidement.

I've spent entire evenings in this ""apartment,"" watching Netflix, doing stuff for work and hanging out with other people watching YouTube.  One time, I fell asleep watching a movie and woke up a bit confused because I was still in my beautiful fake apartment.

I demo the Vive to a lot of people, and everyone has a different app/game that really gets them as ""The Thing"" that makes VR magic to them.  I'd say this app 'gets' probably 1 out of 5 people as the jaw-dropping thing that they love.  (And that's strong, because the rest of the 4/5 is split across probably 10 other cool things).

When VR glasses get smaller and wireless, I'm probably going to live in this apartment about as much as I do my own.  Don't judge me. | I watched a movie with someone in Virginia, someone in Dallas, and someone in Seattle while sitting on my couch in Southern California. Truely amazing use of this tech. | Most folks in Bigscreen are fairly cerebral and friendly.   Met some Brits and a guy from Washington and we had a four man, guitar, jam session around a campfire.  It is limited to four folks per room which is nice in that you have more control over your company.   You can watch movies and listen to music and trouble shoot VR tech issues.   Pretty great stuff! | Bigscreen is a VR desktop and chatroom but the stand out feature is multiplayer screen sharing in VR. Singleplayer it is a solid virtual desktop with a good UI. In multiplayer each user can stream their desktop in the room as if each person had their own monitor. It is a very cool sensation to sit ""side by side"" with friends in the VR room and play a game online together, though the framerates will vary. 

I used the Vive with a GTX 970 I was able to get ~20-30 FPS with Rocket League, and when watching the game on my friends' screens I got ~2 FPS. On a more gracefully streaming game, Tricky Towers, my friends mentioned they got around 10-15 FPS when watching my screen. There are a few steam settings that need to be changed to run games without closing Bigscreen, and some games will need to be in Borderless Window.

The tech is very impressive but I would have liked a bit more focus on privacy. Once a room is joined, the default setting is to immediately start streaming your desktop. Also, the Vive microphone was active by default. There didn't appear to be an easy way to mute that didn't involving aiming a laser pointer at a virtual screen. Regardless of these issues, it is an excellent VR desktop and chatroom with a good UI. The environments look good and have a couple of different orientations, such as a couch and TV or a bed with the screen projected on the ceiling. Absolutely worth giving it a try. | Bigscreen does a stunning job of providing you with a friendly environment that you can share with both friends and strangers.

I entered a room to watch John Wick, ran into an issue where my headset went black (twice) but I will not fault something classed as beta, what it does it does very well.

Being able to project your entire monitor onto a large wall so that each user can watch and listen at the same time is so basic yet so brilliant, it's the kind of VR experience we have all wanted and it's shaping up to be more than just a fun little tool to mess around in.

When VR becomes more maintsream I can see software like this becoming the norm and communication being redefined completely.

I shot a box, the box shot me back. A few shouts of ""I'm mufukin Legolas' later and I'm breathing hard, sweating and thoroughly entertained. Scores of enemies lay shattered at my feet. Arrows embedded in the walls, the ceiling and floor. 

My wife thought I looked dumb shooting invisible arrows straight up at the ceiling while kneeling and swearing. I didn't. I felt like I looked awesome. You will be ducking, kneeling, spinning, nocking, shooting, nocking, shooting until you fall over. 

Oh ya  I did get the headset chord caught around my foot so watch out for that. Also there was bullet time when bullets and things get a little too close to your face (which is awesome) 

This game, it's awesome. | One of the first games I tried was Valve's ""The Lab"". I found myself gravitating towards the Longbow minigame. I liked the act of firing a bow so much that I thought I'd search for more expansive bow and arrow experience. Thats where I came across Holopoint. The mechanics of the game are quite simple, but so enjoyable. Each time I hit a target, it fires back at me, causing me to have to dodge out of the way. This is what makes the action feel so cool. Each shot I take, I immediately move/lean/crouch out of the way and into position for another shot. When you begin to string together shots and position changes, its an incredible and oddly fluid/graceful feeling.

For the price, Holopoint is a pretty fun experience. I experienced no motion sickness, no tracking issues, and had no trouble enjoying the experience. Its a very active game, so prepare to sweat. If you're a fan of the bow and arrow mechanic, I definitely recommend. | Holopoint is a fast archery combat game which demands a lot physical movement, precision and quick re-orientation work of its players. Playing this right causes solid sweating after few minutes. The learning curve is quiet good and the fun playing it is going to increase with it.

Persanally this is one of my favorite VR games now. It has not much content but the thing it does are mostly right. It has high replay value if you see it like me as a game for workout.

The most impressiv thing which did this game for me was to break my „gamepad-lethargy“, how i call it now. Decades of playing just with keyboard & mouse or with a gamepad teached me to press a button or stick to move around and avoid to be hit by bullets. In VR games my reaction time was sooo sloooow and in many situation i just stood dump around and got hit and was frustrated. I could have moved a step right or left but somehow it didnt work. And then in Holopoint there was the moment then I jumped, yes JUMPED, to avoid a projectile. And now I constantly move around - using the little room I have in VR to it‘s full extend – to get the best angle to shoot or get to the savest spot in the room. I crouch, twist or bend my body to avoid projectiles.  No other VR game demand this much movement from its players than Holopoint. The constant necessary flow of movement, re-orientation, aiming and shooting is exhilarating and chilling in the same time.

Sure there are a few downsides in this game. Biggest is the poor bow mechanic compared with games like QuiVR. In QuiVR shooting with the bow fast feels natural and it is possible to headshot enemies over large distances. Using the bow in Holopoint feels awkward in the first place but gets better after a short time. My advice for people who come from QuiVR: look in the option menu and try around different settings, this helped me to get better results. The main reason for the awkward feeling is that the grip is too much below the center of the bow. It feels like you dont hold the grip but the bow arm below it. I dont know why the developer did this. They might had a reason and in time i got used to it. Now 95% shots are hits. There are also other things which could be adressed with little effort and would make the game even better. I hope the developer is going to put more work in this jewel to create a true tressure :)

In single player, Cyberpong VR is best described as VR Breakout with a dash of Tetris.  Blocks spawn at the back of the arena and slowly move towards you.  You destroy them with bouncing balls and powerups until a block makes it to your side.  Then the game is over.  There's strategy in how you save and use the powerups, and skill in juggling and aiming the many balls.

The suprise for me was PvP multiplayer, where it plays like VR Pong.  There are no powerups or blocks, just returning the ball back and forth as it becomes faster and faster.  It sounds simple, and it is, but being face to face in VR with your opponent brings so much to the game.  It's an absolute blast.  Shoutout to Shaquille who beat me easily 5 games straight.

Cyberpong will have you moving all around the required play area, but it doesn't push you to swing with the same vigor that HoloBall does.  I've had to take a break for a few days from HoloBall for my arm to recover.  Cyberpong brings my pulse up, but doesn't wear me out.

TL;DR: While Cyberpong VR and HoloBall look similar, they play very differently, and both are great fun.  The online multiplayer in Cyberpong VR is an absolute must try. | My main problem with this game, and it's a huge problem I think, is that it maps the playable area to your chaperone bounds exactly.

Couple that with the tiny size of the paddles, and this means you'll be swinging your Vive controllers - at high speeds - right at the bounds of your chaperone, which is usually where you have walls and floors and furniture and what not. I can't tell you how many times I've hit my controllers against stuff, and how many balls I've missed because I'm too afraid to swing at my chaperone bounds.

I can't believe the developers haven't thought about this. Look at Holoball, which does it right: in Settings, you can set a padding area from your chaperone that basically narrows down your playing field so you're not swinging at the edges. And the paddles are larger in Holoball.
In Cyberpong, the default paddles don't even extrude past the controller. No, for that you have to use an ""ability"" or select another character with long but extra narrow paddles. Utterly ridiculous.

Beyond that, it's... eh. It's way too claustrophobic. And the balls are slow, and the shape and position of the paddle makes swings awkward. | Nostalgique de Tetris ou de Pong, amateur de casse brique, fan de gros scores, foncé excellent jeux bien prenant bande son rythmé contrôle intuitif. 
Ce jeux est une vrai séance de sport garantis !!!! | I'm guessing a lot of people are considering whether to buy this or Holoball.  Well, here're my thoughts as someone who owns both:


**NOTE: The following paragraph no longer applies; the Cyberpong team quickly changed the mechanics of the game to allow for smashing and controling the ball to a much, much greater extent.  You don't have to, but you can speed up the pace of the game quite significantly if you do.

Holoball responds to how you hit the ball more than Cyberpong.  Holoball really is more like raquetball, and if you're looking for that smash-hit feeling, then Holoball is what you want.  For me, smashing it ends up straining my elbow after a short play-time, and I start feeling it there before actually working up a sweat.



Cyberpong is more polished, period.  The powerups, the tetris-meets-breakout singleplayer mode, the various characters that have different paddles (although, let's be real here - the default paddle is the best paddle), all of that just makes for a more fleshed-out game.  I played through Holoball and was done with it after about an hour.  I'm still playing single player Cyberpong trying to best my highest time.

And finally, multiplayer.  I'm reserving my judgement until I see what the Holoball team does, but suffice it to say that this is the main selling point for Cyberpong right now.  It lags a bit, but only the interactions between the ball and the other player.  You never have a problem making contact with the ball (i.e. the ball never lags through your hand or anything).  It's incredibly simple - just barebones pong against another person - but that's all it needs to be.  Facing off against another human being who can wave to you, taunt a bit, sympathize when something crazy happens.  You feel the company, and it's fantastic.

All in all, I'd recommend this over Holoball as of right now. | For VR, this is a great, easy to learn (and play) single or multi-player game that I have really enjoyed, especially when at home and taking a work break from Covid.  It's  like ping pong with colorful cubes and the object is to keep breaking them before they reach the top.

I played OddPlanet before I played Limbo, and ended up playing Limbo just because all the reviews mentioned that it was better. They were right. Whilst Limbo is a few years older it's held up better than OddPlanet has, and was executed with much more finesse.

My big criticism of OddPlanet really comes down to the controls. The jump mechanic is clunky, leading several of the puzzles to be more about getting the timing of your jump absolutely dead set perfect rather than having the challenge be about solving the puzzle itself. It's often a case that you work out what you have to do, but it takes 60 tries to get it right. If I want that I'll go buy a platformer and smash my controller up when I get mad.

If you loved Limbo and are looking for more this is a reasonable substitute, but don't expect it to be as good. | [b]OddPlanet[/b] is a decent little love letter to Limbo that suffers from a stunted playtime and some over-simplified puzzles. 

A girl has no name as she crash-lands on a strange alien world, nor does a girl have much in the way of a defence from its many hostile inhabitants except for cowering in the shadows until danger has passed. There's some great set-pieces here, the best of which involves being captured by the terrifying resident Neanderthal tribe and your subsequent escape from their cave but while much of the art direction and atmospherics are on point, the entire experience sometimes feels overly derivative. There's no real reason for your character to be a copy of the glowing-eyed silhouette boy from Limbo. His anonymity was a major point of that game's story; here, you see the girl's face and hear her voice several times.

A lot of work has gone into [b]OddPlanet[/b] over the past couple of years from its original sole chapter and it arrives on Steam with another two in tow. It's not enough really; there doesn't feel like there's any real resolution at the end of the game which, for an experience that relies heavily on its plot to balance its plain platforming and puzzles, will leave some players feeling a bit short-changed.

Still, I can't really not give this a recommendation based on the complaint that I really wanted to play more of it, can I?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J59PEa50p14 | 怎么说呢，内容有点少，只有三章，很快就能通关，之前搜地狱边境类似的游戏时无意间看到的，当时只有第一章，玩过觉得挺吸引人，在这找到了全部内容，挺想玩的就买了下来。相对之下价格是有点贵，但不影响其可玩性。我在steam上玩过的游戏不多，在这里稍微发表下看法。
剧情方面还不错，但挺无语的。讲述了一个小女孩离奇地来到一个奇异的星球后发生的故事，经历种种最后还是...[spoiler]剧透内容慎看，小女孩最开始遇到的那个怪人到最后也没出来，这点在剧情上还是挺失败的，整个游戏基本都是在跟蜘蛛斗智斗勇，最后好不容易找到个宠物还挂了，情绪从第一章的好奇欢快到最后变成了绝望无助，然后好像发展到关键时刻突然就ＴＨＥ　ＥＮＤ了，还是待在这个星球，不讲为什么来也不说怎么走，敢情这剧情就是来虐的— —[/spoiler]希望以后还会更新新内容。
游戏难度方面，真的很容易，有的时候感觉到僵局了到处走走就知道怎么办了，毕竟提示很多，看着提示玩完简直没难度。
画面方面，一看就是模仿地狱边境的，还好这个游戏还有彩色内容，不至于完全雷同于地狱边境，层次感不错，我也挺喜欢这种风格。 
音乐方面，这种游戏玩起来相当多的感觉部分来自于音乐了，该有的乐调都有，带入感也挺强，当然主要是那种冷冷清清的死寂的感觉。总之，各方面都不错，值得一玩，但不要拿它跟地狱边境比，比不了的。
后面的内容在中国的网站上也没啥攻略，但确实不难，最后祝大家玩得愉快~ | I originally played this many moons ago (10 yrs?) way back when it was an app on an iPod. Back then, when it first came out, it was only ever one episode. Slowly over that time it has grown into 3 small episodes and been ported to PC. The developer is really Piotr Krol (Polish I believe?) and believe me when I say this, this is his greatest showcase out of all his current products.

A few moan about the controls not being super responsive at times and that the voice acting seems somewhat out of place, but these gripes seem really in consequential and easy to excuse when you admire the heavily inspired limbo world he has created and the magical score and sound effects that enrich the environment to life. Also believe me, the controls are much worse on the mobile version, plus on the mobile version you get constant advertisements that like to pop up as soon as you try and make a jump.

Story is a little girl who crash lands on an extremely hostile alien world where everything wants to kill you. Living in Australia I can relate to this as everything wants to kill us here too. Like the game we too have giant spiders that are poisonous and about the size of a large dog. Also like the game, if you go out to centre of the outback, you would probably come across some primitive Neanderthals whose only language is throwing rocks at you. As for the swamp filled with frogs it was very reminiscent of the top end of Queensland during flood season. Cane toads everywhere on the roads that make a popping sound under tyres like bubble wrap which can be quite addictive. 

Here I am thinking she has landed on an alien world. Struth never did I realise she's probably in my backyard. Loneliness definitely gets to you out here in the 'never, never', while she made a short connection with an opossum/cat looking creature and constantly writes in her journal, it’s just not the same as having a deep and meaningful with a bottle of beer and saying amen to a porcelain bowl. Not that she's probably old enough to drink, on the other hand it would perfectly explain her parking skills. Pffft women drivers (roll eyes) ...

Game abruptly ends with the girl closing her eyes while resting against a tree, probably her final thought being that there are good squish noises (spiders) and there are bad squish noises (you). In any case, Australia has trees that kill people too. Undoubtedly Piotr Krol is warning everyone, 'Visit Australia if you plan to die on an odd planet'...

76561197970698176,466500,35MM,0.0166666666666666,Indie,0,"This game is my Roman empire.  It haunts me.  The 8 hours I have in this game (as of writing) tell nothing of the amount of time I spend [i]thinking[/i] about this game.  I wish that there was a way to give a mixed review instead of solely positive or negative, but I'm rating this game positively just because of the amount of space it occupies in my brain.

The first time I beat it all the way through, I got the bad ending because it honestly is one of the most frustrating gameplay experiences I've ever encountered, and I was trying to fly through it as quickly as possible.  It has bad controls and no direction, and it's buggy as all hell.  There were times when my game would just [i]not load the items necessary for progression[/i], completely soft-locking me in some cases.  Like one of the earlier chapters of the game has you looking for a bucket to use on the well, but in my game, the bucket just didn't spawn in either of the locations it was supposed to.  Later, I needed a gas canister, and [i]that[/i] didn't spawn, either.  The few shooting sections in the game are also just abysmal and don't work.  I really enjoy the game as an atmospheric post-apocalyptic walking simulator, and the few points where it deviated away from walking simulator territory fell extremely flat because of the janky controls.

However, this game's story and characters take up so much of my heart and mind, and I don't know why.  Just walking along with the nameless companion and taking pictures of both him and the world fills me with such inexplicable warmth.  Even though the game does not contain that much dialogue, the dynamic between the two main characters is something I keep coming back to.  Maybe it's because of what I imagine for them while playing; maybe I am imposing something on the game that's not actually there.  But like I said, I got the bad ending first, [spoiler]and you lose your companion, and when I woke up in the metro station without him by my side, I cried.[/spoiler]  I'm currently working on getting the ""Continue to live...?"" ending, where you keep your companion with you because... I don't know.  There's something deep inside me that cannot rest until I finish the game with both main characters together and alive.

This is extremely subjective, rambling nonsense about... [vague hand-wave] the ability for even art that is not objectively ""good"" to get its claws inside of someone and move them in signifcant ways.

TL;DR: Do I like this game?  Yes, and I will probably keep revisiting it every small handful of years to reimmerse myself in the world and everything.  And between playthroughs, I will continue to not shut up about it to anyone who will listen.
Can I actually [i]recommend[/i] this game?  Well... in a word: no.  I am well aware that I am kind of a weird guy and that it's incredibly unlikely that this little indie project will do for anyone else what it has done for me.  And without that deep, personal attachment to it, the bugginess and jank is [i]really[/i] not worth sitting through.  The act of actually playing this game consistently makes me wish I liked it a little less so that I wouldn't be compelled to keep revisiting it.

But if you're a masochist for bad controls and getting soft-locked out of progression, or you just wanna try and figure out what the hell I'm on about (buddy, not even I know...), go for it. | Давно хотел поиграть в 35ММ, но как-то руки не доходили.

Cheating AI to compensate for being bit dumb is common practice in RTS games, but apparently the devs think that their AI is stupid beyond any redemption so they juiced all the cheating levers to the moon and the only thing that remains is artificial difficulty in the most boring and tedious way.

Raiding/attacking an AI is absolutely pointless unless you can actually destroy their main base. They're barely relying on population for their production and any villagers/military units you kill respawn almost instantly anyway so it's absolutely pointless to raid them.

The issue seemed a bit less apparent during the Campaign, so at least that part was bit better balanced. But trying out Conquest mode afterwards is just absolutely disgusting. It's doable, but an absolute drag cause it requires constant micromanagement to barely compensate for all the AI cheating. And even then it takes so long to finish off an opponent because raiding an AI does barely anything, so unless you're way way stronger the AI will just bounce back in the blink of an eye.

Bit of cheating would be fine, but I mean the AI units literally respawn like 2-3+ times faster, and their armies have barely any upkeep so it doesn't matter if you destroy their economy cause they will just field an army of 15+ units without any economy supporting them anyway. It's just a joke imo, this is not an actual challenge.

Please put some actual thought and at least a little bit of effort into your AI so the cheating doesn't have to be so blatantly in your face. 

It's a shame, cause the base game mechanics are interesting enough, the game looks nice visually and has a good theme. The campaign is decent and multiplayer might be fine, but beyond that the AI is a hot broken mess preventing you from having any fun. | Стратегия неплохая, особенно с друзьями, но отдельные кланы за 200 рублей каждый и сама игра которая стоит 1100 это конечно писдец.

Nvidia Fun House es basicamente una demo técnica de Nvidia (como tantas otras que tiene) pero para VR. La aplicación tiene unos requisitos mínimos muy altos, ya que los graficos en ""low"" requieren una GTX 1060, en medium una 1080, y en high dos 1080 en SLI.

Dejando de lado los requisitos mínimos tan altos, es un buen ejemplo de la versatilidad de la Realidad Virtual.

Sinceramente creo que Nvidia debería haber abierto más el espectro de requisitos mínimos para abarcar tarjetas gráficas más modestas (repetimos que los requisitos mínimos están por encima de los que pedía Oculus al principio (y eso que luego se bajaron del carro)) ya que esta demo sólo servirá a aquellos con buenas tarjetas gráficas, o tarjetas en SLi que quieran ver todo tipo de shaders y efectos brutales muy de cerca en RV. | Not anywhere near the depth of The Lab, but for a free game, still pretty fun.

Imagine an RPG where you are so free to do anything that it becomes exceptionally easy to lock yourself into very unpleasant and barely solvable situations. | 任务设计的非常丰富，每个支线任务都设计的很用心，不会给人那种无聊的感觉，而且基本需要动一些脑筋，需要自己寻找线索，有种轻微解谜游戏的感觉 | Seven is an enjoyable isometric thief-style game. It has a terrible name, but the world is interesting to explore and the verticality of the gameplay is fun. | Este juego está muy pero muy infravalorado. Una de las razones principales por las cuales YO CREO que es así, es debido a que es para un público muy específico, además de que salió en un momento inadecuado. Sin embargo, considero que puede acoplarse a muchos estilo de juegos por la gran variedad de mecanicas que este tiene, además de tener un buen soporte para mando aún que no es completamente cómodo. Sigilo, combate a distancia y a corta, craftear, hacer Parkour y más, es un juego bastante sólido, con una historia interesante y se nota demasiado el empeño de los creadores en el apartado visual, pues las cinemáticas están muy bien hechas, además suma muchos puntos el hecho de que sea mundo abierto, pues tienes muchas opciones de exploración.
A pesar de todo esto, como todo juego no es perfecto así que aquí van algunas pros y contras 
Pros:
+Personalización y exploración extensa.
+Elección entre distintos tipos de juegos.
+Soporte para teclado y mouse.
+Apartado gráfico bonito.
+Historia interesante.

Contras:
-Llega a ser abrumador o intimidante al principio por su montón de opciones.
-Algunas fallas notables en animaciones.
-Algunas zonas no son del todo claras.
-Muchas opciones que el juego no te termina de explicar.
-Algunas faltas de puntuación en las traducciones.

A pesar de aquellos puntos, para mí es un juego que se siente esa libertad de explorar y hacer lo que se te plazca y eso me encanta de este juego, recomiendo que si lo quieren jugar vean una guía para entender bien las mecánicas y no se pierdan las primeras horas de juego sin saber que demonios hacer, además de prestar muchísima atención en cualquier tutorial o lo que sea ya que casi todo resulta relevante.

Everything about this game makes you happy. Everyone's always smiling (because your character can only smile), other players are extremely friendly (its totally normal for people to compliment you or congratulate you if you hit them in paintball), and the devs are just as feel-good as the game itself. They are extremely responsive to the community and really have a way of making everyone feel special.

免费游戏里这个超越THE LAB了。因为他是重在社交！ | Sin duda alguna este juego es de lo más recomendable. Es una experiencia social en la que puedes personalizar a tu avatar con distintos trajes, peinados y complementos y luego salir a un hall donde encontrarás a un montón de gente con la que charlar, interactuar y jugar a diferentes juegos.

En RecRoom tenemos una variedad de juegos para elegir, para jugar con amigos o con gente que encontremos conectada en ese momento, todos ambientados en un ambiente estudiantil, tipo instituto o High School, pero de todos ellos para mi gusto los que se llevan la palma son el PaintBall y el Quest for the Golden Trophy recientemente añadido. El primero es, como su nombre indica, un juego de paintball por equipos con varios modos de juego (combate por equipos, capturar la bandera...) y diferentes armas (pistola, escopeta, granadas, rifle de francotirador) todas de pintura. Es extremadamente divertido.
El Quest for the Golden Trophy es un juego parecido a una mazmorra de un rpg, cooperativo hasta 4 jugadores, en el que armados con espadas, escudos y arcos ( y más adelante también podremos encontrar una ballesta y no se si después habrá algo más) tendremos que adentrarnos en una mazmorra con un estilo grafico que simula los pasillos y estancias de un instituto decorados para simular una mazmorra, todo muy original. Jugar con otros 3 amigos me recordó fuertemente a las sensaciones de jugar una raid en juegos como WoW (salvando las distancias). Aqui es todo más casual, y no hay clases ni roles  y las mecánicas son mucho más simples, pero sustituimos la necesidad de una rotación de habilidades optimizada y habilidad con los dedos por habilidad para movernos nosotros mismos, agacharnos, esquivar, apuntar, ser rápidos en resucitar a un compañero caido (chocando las manos) para que pueda volver al combate, interponer nuestro escudo delante de un compañero para protegerlo de un disparo de un enemigo, y cosas así. Me ha parecido que, siendo aun un juego sencillo, sienta muy muy bien las bases de lo que podrían ser futuros mmorpgs y marca el camino a seguir.

Todos los juegos se pueden jugar en abierto, con la gente que haya conectada, o en salas privadas donde podemos invitar a nuestros amigos. Incluso hay una sala social en la que se pueden hacer cosas como jugar una partida de póker o de dados.

Y además de todo ES GRATIS!!!! no se puede pedir más. Si teneis Oculus con touch o HTC Vive, no se a que estais esperando para probarlo!!!

7/10 | absolver is a complex, pvp-oriented, martial-arts inspired fighting game that died on arrival because most gamers are stupid. they do not seek challenge or player expression. when a game gives you roadblocks, they don't play it. when a game gives you options, they look up meta builds. absolver allows you to create your own fighting style by putting together different attacks in order to form combos. the game features a stance system, offering right-front, left-front, right-rear and left-rear facing positions from which you can initiate attacks, and many attacks will end in a stance that is different from the initial one. the combat is a masterclass in player expression. being able to combine different motions in order to create your own fighting style is about as close as it gets to complete freedom in combat while remaining in static animation territory (physics are hard to get right).

players get a wide array of clothing and armour to choose from, allowing for an astronomical number of combinations thanks to absolver's nine equipment slots (head, elbow, shoulder, inner top, outer top, hand, waist, leg and foot). lots of asymmetrical pieces, pleasant colours and often loose-fitting clothes make this game's fashion style stand out.

absolver has a beautiful watercolour-like art style, depicting old structures that have seen better days, calm forest paths, massive temples and highly refined, decorated and gilded environments. sadly, there's little to explore, but what is there is dense in detail and looks amazing.

all of the environments feature detailed soundscapes, from birds singing to machinery moving, from wood creaking to cave ceilings dripping. the environmental soundscapes are complemented by the game's minimalist original soundtrack, featuring lots of different string instruments, blending flamenco, arabic and indian sounding melodies, a few woodwinds, bells and chimes and some nice percussive rhythms to match the rhythm of fights. a final note on the audio side of things, fights sound great. the impact sounds for punches and bashing weapons are heavy. the cutting sounds for swords are okay. these are sort of hard to get right because blades don't make much noise as they cut through flesh, except for when they hit a bone, so knowing how difficult it is to represent cutting sounds, i'll give them a pass.

heavy recommend.","Absolver is a game that is a great way to learn the art of the game, and also to enjoy the limits of the game."
76561197970698176,475520,Unknown,0.8833333333333333,,1,"This is a game where you throw balls at round enemy robots who are trying to shoot you and you can teleport to a series of cubes (the internet is not a big truck... it's a series of cubes!) and depending on where you teleport, you're standing on a different cube face facing a different direction.  It's all very disorienting and kinda disturbing.

I only played the easiest mode (yeah yeah, call me a wimp if you must) where you don't have to throw the balls, you just aim in the direction and fire and it goes that way.  I did OK, but I found that I really had to keep teleporting or I got killed.

Speaking of that, when you die, you only had the one life so that's it.  Then a creepy robotic voice says ""you died! Game over man"" or ""they killed you!""  ""You got shot!"" or some other line. I guess it's amusing...sorta.

The graphics are really basic.  Cubes to land on and stand on, some spacy looking background, round enemy robots that don't move, they just teleport in and eventually locate you and shoot. Oh and it seems the cubes can be destroyed so that means eventually if you survived for long enough, the places to run to might dwindle to nothing.

 It seemed to me that this game was probably made very low budget.  I didn't find the music that memorable, the gameplay was kinda flat and repetitive (but to be fair I was playing the simplest mode where there are no powerups) and I kinda lost interest quickly.

Things I liked about this game:
[list]
 [*] I guess it could be like a big shootout, and maybe with the powerups it'll be cool.  I only barely played it so I might not have seen the best it can give.
 [/list]

Things I didn't like about this game:
 [list]
 [*] Nothing really grabbed me about this game.  I'll try it again and see if I change my mind.
 [/list]

Wait, what was this game about again? | Human Fall Flat is a unique game that combines puzzle and comedy elements. The game offers players to control a clumsy character who must overcome various obstacles and puzzles in surreal levels.

One of the main advantages of the game is its humor. The control of the character is very awkward and naughty, which leads to a lot of funny situations and falls. This makes the game very fun and relaxing.

The puzzles in the game are also very well designed. They require the player's problem-solving skills and creative thinking to overcome the obstacles. However, they are not too difficult, which makes the game accessible to players of any level.

The graphics in the game are also noteworthy. The levels are very colorful and surreal, which creates a unique and memorable atmosphere.

Overall, Human Fall Flat is a great game for those looking for something new and fun. It offers the perfect balance between humor and puzzles, as well as unique graphics and atmosphere.

Ich kann es kurz machen, denn das Meiste kann man hier überall nachlesen. Ich werde es zwar positiv bewerten, weil es durchaus Spaß macht und nie unfair ist - jedenfalls bis jetzt - ABER es gibt einige Dinge, die mir auf die Nerven gehen und zwei davon ganz besonders:

1. Das völlig überflüssige Kopfgewackel, das beim schnellen Laufen sogar noch eins drauf setzt und mein körperliches Wohlbefinden auf eine verdammt harte Probe stellt - Stichwort 'Motion-Sickness' - und das sich im Menü NICHT abschalten lässt. Menschen, die darunter leiden, sollten die Finger von dem Game lassen.

2. Ich habe in meiner kurzen Spielzeit einige Errungenschaften freigeschaltet (nicht mitgezählt wie viele) aber es waren mehr als drei oder vier. Angezeigt wird hier nur Eine. Das nervt. Mir ist alleine deshalb schon die Lust am Weiterspielen vergangen, weil ich da eigentlich mit 100% durch wollte.

Technisch ist es ansonsten OK, es läuft flüssig, die Steuerung ist etwas zu träge für meinen Geschmack und manchmal geht ein Fußtritt mitten durch, ohne Schaden anzurichten, weil man einfach zu dicht am Gegner steht. Ecken und Winkel, die man gerade noch befreit hatte, damit man keine Gegner im Rücken hat und man sich mit dem Haufen vor einem in Ruhe beschäftigen kann - könnt ihr nicht immer aber oft vergessen, weil die spawnen trotzdem aus heiterem Himmel direkt hinter euch, wo gerade noch alles leer und ""gesäubert"" war. Keine Ahnung, wo die dann plötzlich herkommen aber anscheinend direkt aus dem Nirvana... Ziemlich bekloppt.

Spielerisch ist es aufgrund mangelnder Abwechslung und gewisser Eintönigkeit mit 'Dying Light' (1) vergleichbar, und bitte - ich weiß, dass die Fan-Gemeinde für den ersten Teil extrem groß ist und ihr jetzt bei dieser Bemerkung Schnappatmung bekommt - aber es hat keinen Zweck, mir den Kopf abzubeißen, denn mir hat der erste Teil trotzdem nicht annähernd so gut gefallen, wie der Zweite. Das sieht eben jeder/jede anders.

Wenn ihr wirklich ein Zombie-Spiel haben wollt, wo alles passt, dann solltet ihr euch mal 'Dying Light 2' wenigstens mal ansehn, das Studio ist das Selbe. Das ist um Längen besser als das hier und sehr viel interessanter. Dort wurde eigentlich an alles gedacht, was ich hier vermisse. Menüeinstellungen - ALLES da, Steuerung perfekt und direkt, Story - ist gut und gar nicht mal so übel, gute und anspruchsvolle Nebenquests (die Meisten jedenfalls), Adrenalin pur und richtig gutes Gameplay mit guter Optik.

Ich werde das hier jetzt erstmal wieder deinstallieren, denn trotz einigem Spielspaß schafft 'Dead Island Definitive Edition' es nicht, mich mitzunehmen.

- Visual Improvements: The game has received a significant graphical upgrade, with enhanced textures, environmental objects, and lighting effects that make the world feel more immersive.

- Content: The Definitive Edition includes both Dead Island and Dead Island: Riptide, along with all the DLC, offering a lot of content for players.

- Quality of Life Improvements: The game features several quality-of-life improvements, such as better inventory management and additional gameplay tweaks that make the experience smoother.

Cons:
- Performance Issues: Despite the visual improvements, the game still struggles with performance, particularly with frame rate drops and occasional bugs.

- Outdated Mechanics: Some of the core gameplay mechanics feel dated and repetitive, which might not appeal to everyone.

- Mixed Reactions to Changes: While many improvements were made, some changes, like altered weapon models and textures, have received mixed feedback from players who were nostalgic about the original versions.

Overall, Dead Island: Definitive Edition offers a lot of content and visual enhancements, but it still has some performance and gameplay issues that might not be for everyone.

I remember trying it back in the day and not vibing with it. Now that I'm a bit older, I really like what this game has done. In a time when everything was so heavily focused on guns it makes guns practically useless. The melee has a lot of weight to it that not many games from the time did. There are certainly aspects I wish were improved but taking everything at face value I have to say this is a fairly unique experience.

Jedną z nich jest właśnie mały, prosty hack'n'slash, Rover The Dragonslayer. 

Wcielamy się w postać imieniem Rover. Rover jest... Pogromcą smoków... i bez żadnego przygotowania wyrusza by zabić zagrażające krainie, w której chyba mieszka, smoki. To by było na tyle jeśli chodzi o fabułę. Tej jest tu minimum, choć doceniam, że w ogóle jest. W trakcie rozgrywki możemy spotkać wyglądające podobnie do siebie postacie, które będą nam zlecały zadania polegające na praktycznie tym samym (zabijanie setek przeciwników danego typu). Warto je wykonywać choćby dlatego by zebrać potrzebne do rozwijania umiejętności postaci ""dusze"". Są to praktycznie punkty doświadczenia, które wykorzystujemy na rozwój bohatera. Mam wrażenie, że bardzo szybko można stworzyć z Rovera niepowstrzymaną maszynę do zabijania, ale jak się okazuje, gra jest bardzo krótka, więc to nie powinno przeszkadzać. 

Grafika to oczywiście gotowe zestawy assetów z Unity, ale połączono je z klasą i robią klimat. Poza tym, dobrze wykorzystano możliwości Unity. Wszelkie efekty, rozmycia i tak dalej, wyglądają bardzo ok. Co do muzyki mogę powiedzieć tyle, że jest ładna. Za to dźwięki przeciwników i odzywający się co jakiś czas narrator(??? bo nie wiem czy to dobre słowo na odzywki typu ""monster cobo"", ""well?"" czy ""FIGHT!"") nie dość że rozsadzają bębenki (przy ściszonych słuchawkach) to są bardzo słabe. No, ale to jedyna rzecz, przed którą mogę ostrzec tak na dobrą sprawę. 

Gdy kupowałem tę grę nie spodziewałem się wiele. Ot, kolejna gierka zrobiona na kolanie w Unity, pewnie tak zła, że aż zabawna. Myliłem się, i chociaż widać iż jej twórca jest niedoświadczony, to gra ma potencjał i potrafi wciągnąć. Prosty hack'n'slash z widokiem ""z góry"" do szybkiego przejścia ""na raz"".

You don't gain anything by picking up the early access game which has seen no attention from the dev shortly after it went live. Look at the ""eary access game"" notes from the developer written in June of 2016 and feel free to browse the trello board ( http://trello.com/b/oOCNIEaS ) listing the tasks he was planning on but never got around to:

Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?
“The game will be in Early Access for at least a month, until it has proper assets (sound, graphics), as well as more content.



It's a shame I can't recommend this game; it missed all of its early access milestones. It seems the developer had great ideas to make the game more fun. | This is my favorite VIVE game so far (I have about 25). Just be prepared for a true workout as you get better at it. Tonight I made it to wave 26 and was sweating like no other! 

This is truely a mix of Tron discs and Captain America's shield. At about level 15 it starts getting really intense with dodging, shields up, spinning around and throwing your shield. 

I will say that the controls when launching the disc still don't feel absolute. About 80% of the time I hit my target but there are times when you KNOW you launched correctly and the disc didn't do what you want. Kind of like Wii or Move controllers. When this gets fixed, I will be in heaven.

I am really looking forward to where this game goes next! BRAVO!!!! | If you have a VR, I would recommend this game if you're into action games or ones where you have to survive in a arena for as long as you can. I think it is still in early access and Idk what the future update will look like but so far its a fun game. A Game where you're main weapon is a shield plate you can throw at enemy drones that tries to eliminate you as well as you can deflect their laser projectiles or reflect it back at them. Overall a good game with only 1 problem. A VR positioning issue that is weird to fix but always happens whenever you start the game. | As it is very early access I'll keep this light. I enjoyed playing it as is for now and already we are getting frequent updates from the developer. Well worth it for under a fiver.

UPDATED:  It's been 4 months since any word from the developer despite requests from users in the discussion forums.  This is simply part of the 'great VR cash grab' of 2016.  Avoid and lets not reward this behavior! | edit* No updates to the game in over a year.  I think he abandonned this game.  Fun , but might not be worth $5 now as there is no reason to go back to it after you got a high score or two.  Online leaderboards aren't shown in the game itself , you have look at them here --> http://steamcommunity.com/app/488150/discussions/0/351659808497694953/ *

This game is a hell of a workout :)  Starts of relatively slow , but come wave 25 or so and it's just pure madness.

In this game you throw a shield using either your left or right hand at small flying robots that shoot back at you if you don't clear them quick enough.  You are able to reflect the shots back at them with your shield.  Every shield throw and reflect has to be absolutely perfect if you want to hit something , which can be a little frustrating at times , but sure is a great challenge that I'm sure I'll get better at the more I play.

Only a handful of classes and some of those marked as experimental.  
Combat is primarily melee with no magic avaiable.  
User interface and keybinds feel clunky.
Game does not flow well (e.g. needing to talk to NPCs in the beginning gets very repetitive in a game where you're expected to die and start over frequently).

I'm not going to refund it, though.  This could turn out to be a very good game, and I want to support the dev.  However, I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you accept there's a lot of work that still needs to be done. | This game is a lot of fun as long as it caters to the kind of roguelikes you prefer playing. What I mean is that this game, while being very strategic with currency, elemental resists, attack stances, etc., some people looking for, say, another ADOM or ToME might be dissapointed with a lack of variety in equipment and attack methods (i.e. you will be in melee 90% of the time; there appears to be no spells in the game aside from wands at the moment). Classical roguelike elements like cursing and identification exists, and this game features a corruption system that is somewhat similar to ADOM's (albeit a lot nastier and dangerous in this game). 

Currently there are 5 classes (3 of which are locked for hard and higher difficulties) and they are generally pretty unique and interesting. For instance, you can play as a spirit that can't use items or talk to NPC's but possesses the ability to possess and completely control a monster that's close to death. Gameplay and strategy appear to be largely tied to the classes and their playstyles at the moment, so I suggest doing some reading (or better yet, watch a video) in order to determine if this game sounds like it'd be fun to play.

Overall I'm very pleased this is an actual roguelike with strategic depth, and not a twin-stick shooter ""roguelike"" the genre has been flooded with in recent years. I Recommend this to anyone interested in the former, as it has a lot of potential, in my opinion. More classes and more variety in consumables would be a good start for the game to improve, I think. | Восемь часов. Уже куча попыток. Вообще никаких сдвигов. Дохну в первом данже. Ад.

Könnte ich meine Erinnerung an das Game löschen und es nochmal spielen, würd ichs tun. | When my only real complaint is why isn't there more, that's not really a problem. The fact the writing and score make a text-based story compelling and chilling enough to keep me glued to my seat shows how well written this game is. | Allora, innanzitutto va detto che il gioco è solamente testuale (molta roba da leggere, sia utile a stabilire un ""ambiente"" realistico, sia informazioni) perciò non aspettatevi azione nel senso classico, piuttosto aspettatevi di indagare...e riflettere, anche se sul secondo punto sono abbastanza confuso.
C'è poco da aggiungere al titolo, Orwell cita ovviamente l'autore di 1984 dove in una società distopica, le persone sono costantemente spiate per il bene di una nazione in cui non esiste alcuna opposizione.
Orwell è la piattaforma che andremo ad utilizzare, ""l'occhio"" del governo che attraverso indiscriminate ricerche e libere estrapolazioni di dati da social media, account bancari, cellulari, computer, dati medici e via dicendo sarà nostro compito assicurare alcuni ""terroristi"" (se lo siano o meno è vostro compito scoprirlo, e qui un altro problema che sorge) alla giustizia.
Qual'è il confine se esiste fra privacy e sicurezza? Ci abbiamo già rinunciato entrando nei social media e dando le nostre informazioni a qualsiasi sito le chieda? Paranoia o realtà? Se non abbiamo nulla da nascondere, cosa ci importa? 
Ma quali sono i criteri per esseri considerati ""un pericolo""? Magari si comincia con cose serie ma poi si arriva al conformismo totale sospettoso di qualsiasi differenza?
Queste solo alcune delle domande che il gioco pone, forse in maniera un pò ""guidata"" (alla fine la libertà di pensiero significa che il pensiero non deve essere influenzato) in certe parti, ma se all'inizio può sembrare avvincente indagare e collegare punti fra i vari indizi che prenderemo senza troppi scrupoli con qualche click da diversi metodi....alla fine rimarrà un pò di amarezza.
Perchè ...se capitasse veramente a voi? Mettiamo sia tutto complottismo e paranoia, ma se potesse accadere?
Non siamo poi così lontani, e le notizie del gioco rimandano a fatti reali ovviamente con nomi e tempi diversi.
Lo consiglio, non dura molto, si finisce in 7 ore, è completamente tradotto, ci sono delle piccole sbavature (soprattutto confusione fra gender o nomi di persone, o frasi tradotte troppo letteralmente dall'inglese)
Non credo comprerò il seguito, totalmente in inglese e che a quanto ho letto non è pari a questo.
Non mi ha ""sbalordito"" enormemente, ma fa pensare sia in termini di soluzione di alcuni ""enigmi"" che di temi etici.

The mechanics are all quite cool, but for me the entire design falls apart on one fatal flaw. I usually play these kind of games to do some quick up to one hour long runs in the evening. However, with this one, two evenings in a row, the runs ended up in a lengthy slog that almost lasted past midnight. And the worst thing was that the gameplay did not even change very much during those 2+ hr long runs, I just eventually felt like I was doing the same thing over and over again. The resulting boredom and loss of concentration (which is highly required ALL the time or you will lose fast) made me perform worse, so I did not even win in the end.

1) I can't seem to control where the different effects get inserted into the sound loops the program chooses for me
2) I can't choose which sound to create, I have to just create a bunch until the one I want appears

Fun free music experience. The 7.1, I think, is used great. You create different music crystals with the trigger finger, make them come into contact with each other, they start creating a beat already chosen by the game, then you can grab them and throw them in any direction to make that sound come from that direction. Then pull out more crystals and do the same thing. If you don't like the sound of one of them, you can pop them by stabbing them with your controller. There aren't too many different sounds created, hopefully that will expand. It does seem like the same song can be recreated. What I had fun with is just using 1 or maybe a small dose of a second crystal and placing the crystals like they are the instrument. For example, there was one sound that sounded like someone humming something briefly, and another sound that sounded like someone snapping their fingers. So I placed the crystals where a persons mouth would be for humming and a persons hands would be for snapping. Then the drum sounds I placed behind me where a drum set often is located on stage. I put water droplet sounds on the floor. I enjoyed it and since its free, nothing but thumbs up!

Here's what i mean:

I just played a multiplayer game with a random dude. I spawned in, looked up and saw him looking at me. He waved at me. I waved back. 

I didn't know what to do to start the match. So i made a shrug gesture towards him. He pointed to the table where it clearly stated what button i had to press. I pressed it and the game begun.

We played for a long time. Both of us trying different serves and screws. During the match we did all kinds of gestures towards eachother. Gestures of sadness when you lost an important point while the other celebrates with his hands in the air. Gestures of frustration when you lost a lot of points in a row etc... Body language in VR is really easy to understand. At least to me...

It was getting late and i had to go to sleep. I waved, he waved back and i disconnected. Never to see that player again...

What's so cool about all this is that you can express yourself without any pre-programmed gestures like /wave, /dance, /whatever. Now you can make your own little dance when you win. You do your own gestures. You do you! It's magical!

I can't wait for similar games like this one!

I don't mention much about the actual game here except for the VR multiplayer experience.. But the game is actually really good. It feels pretty realistic. Sure it's not perfect... But it is pretty damn close i'd say. | WARNING! Consider this abandoned by the developer. WARNING!

Rarely have I seen a developer this involved, this commited and this passionate about their game. I had the pleassure of helping him test some items. Do you know why he was up late testing and developing? Because ONE PERSON was unhappy with something about his game, so he re-wrote a major part of the game to be better for us all.

I got the chance to speak with him one on one and I can tell you without a doubt, he cares about this community and he wants nothing more than for us to just have fun.

Але важко уявити, що в 2025 році ми все ще змушені бачити у світі ігор проросійські наративи. У новій версії гри розробники ""відзначилися"" черговим ігноруванням української локалізації та повного ігнорування української нації, яка переживає героїчну боротьбу за своє існування та незалежність.

It's hard to believe that in 2025 we are still witnessing pro-Russian narratives in the gaming industry.

9,5/10 | Snake Pass is pretty flawed: It has a less polished presentation than you would expect, and the camera sometimes struggles with some of the more intricate challenges. And the optional collectibles feel unrewarding and only serve to encourage the player to linger in levels that are already a bit bland.

However, the unique movement controls work well, and coiling across bamboo scaffolding feels way more expressive than one would typically expect from a game character with such a slow,  deliberate movement.

[h3]Történet:[/h3]
Rögtön az után, hogy a törp hercegnő eljutott a gonosz boszorkányhoz, s megkérte, hagyjon fel a zagyvaságaival, a banya elszállásolta a hercegnőt, s ez idő alatt jóbarátok lettek. Teljesen érthetetlen.
Minden esetre, eljött az idő, hogy a hercegnő hazatérjen, így hát a banya felajánlotta, hogy hajójával visszamehet a törp királyságba, s ő maga is elkísérte a hercegnőt az útra.
Amint hazaért, a helyiek boldogan fogadták, viszont, hercegnő érezte, hogy valami nincs rendben.
A kastély eltűnt!
Nem is értem, hogy nem vette észre...
Míg a hercegnő az inasokkal beszélt, és lesegették, hogy a palota, a csodás kertjével, szobraival, eltűnt, addig egy sötét, csuklyás alak kihallgatta őket.
Szerencsére, ő a barátunk. Azért jött, hogy megcsodálja a törpök meseszép kertjét és gazdagságát.
A sötét alak tudta, hogy ki a felelős mindezért, hiszen már látta korábban is ezt megtörténni, máshol.
A kietlen pusztaságok mágusa lopta el az építményt, melyet játék méretűre zsugorított, hogy díszítse vele otthonát.
A titokzatos macska a hercegnő segítségére sietett, és támogatja őt az útján, hiszen az út bevezet egyenesen a titokzatos erdőbe is, ahol törp az előtt még soha nem is járt.
A hercegnőnek minden segítség jól jön.

[h3]Játékról:[/h3]
A játék egy roppant egyszerű, és szép kis kattingatós játék, ahol az a lényeg, hogy a munkásokkal építményeket építs, vagy javíts fel, s eltávolítsd az akadályokat az útról, pályáról pályára, míg meg nem szerzed az ellopott palotát.
A játékban [b]40 pálya[/b] van, telis-tele akadályokkal, s megoldandó feladatokkal.
Minden pályán vannak kitűzött célok, mint például, gyűjts össze x mennyiségű kaját, építsd meg a 3. szintű malmot, öld meg a szörnyeket, építsd fel a hidakat, tisztítsd meg az utat, öntözd meg a fákat, és a többi.

A munkásoknak kiosztott feladatok [b]sorrendbe állítható[/b]. A várakozás alatt lévő feladatok törölhetőek a sorból, ha elég jó vagy, akár teljesen új sorrendet is állíthatsz fel nekik.
[b]A játék időre megy![/b] Ezt nem állíthatod be, vagy nem kapcsolhatod ki.
Meg kell szerezned a 3 csillagot minden pályán. Nyilván nem kötelező, de ez is a játék része, egy teljesíthető kihívás.

[h3]Hibák:[/h3]
Ez a rész is pont olyan, mint a második része a játéknak.
Ugyan azokkal a hibákkal rendelkezik. Egyszerűen csak a pálya és a történet lett megváltoztatva, minden más maradt.
Továbbra [b]sincs relax mód[/b] vagy más nehézség.
[b]Nem lehet új játékot kezdeni[/b], nincs új, vagy másik profil.
Ha már végigvitted a játékot, és újra kezdenéd, mint az előző részekben, az 1 és 2 részben is, itt sincs lehetőség sorrendben újra végigmenni a pályákon. Minden megoldott szint után automatikusan az utolsó szintre ugrik, így neked újra meg újra vissza kell kattintanod arra a szintre, amelyiken jártál. Fárasztó, ha újrajátszanád.. na persze, nem a nulláról.

[h3]Megéri-e?[/h3]
Mivel a [b]játék csak egyszer játszható[/b], így akciósan megéri, teljes áron semmiképpen sem.
Szerintem.

I wasn't allowed to leave the house, my mom was really really battling mental health issues. And there I was. 16 going on 17 cooped up.

Ever since becoming an adult I've purchased a copy on everything I own. It's like a reminder or having a favorite book and seeing all the editions. 
I'm glad I was able to play this game, and I'm glad we're able to share our stories here on why we love the games we do. | Играю в это творение с самого его выпуска на просторах интернета. Некогда меня посадил в нее брат, и это была лучшая рекомендация по играм, которую он мог мне когда-либо дать. Цифру, которую видят пользователи рядом с моей иконкой, это может, дай Бог, 1/10 часть всех проведенных часов за этой игрой. Да, когда выпускалась игра, мне было 9 лет, и я играла по своему незнанию и неумению с чит-кодами, тем не менее, освоившись с годами, поняла, что куда интереснее, когда имеешь риск, чем читы, которые ограничивали и делали тебя непобедимым. Да, всех фишек игры вдоль и поперек мне узнать по сей день не удалось, и я к этому не стремлюсь. 
Эта игра стоит того, чтобы вы ей уделили внимание, как минимум потому, что это огромный открытый мир с неимоверно широким выбором заданий. И, лично я, до сих пор не видела в гейминге игр, которые бы хоть чуть-чуть сравнивались с ней. Не спорю, опережая негативные возгласы, есть уйма других не менее проработанных хороших игр, но, по моему мнению, это не то. Skyrim тот самый прорывной проект 2011-го год, который до сих пор держит геймеров у экранов, так и вовлекая из года в год перепройти его заново.
Запуская игру, ты идешь туда уже далеко не ради графики, ибо, конечно, стоит признать, что для 2025-го года это уже не аргумент. Ты идешь ради неповторимого сюжета, который всего через пару игровых сессий так и просит подпевать бардам в таверне ""Герой он бесстрашный, он непобедим..."". Ведь герой, Довакин - это ты, человек неопределенной расы, который неведомым образом попадается на пересечении границы и оказывается тем, кто спасет весь мир. Причем игра дает возможность спасти Скайрим абсолютно разными способами: как будучи воином в драконьих доспехах с секирой Вутрад наперерез, так и крысой из Гильдии, тыркающей противников на х10 урона бритвой Мерунеса. Продвигаясь по разным сюжетным линиям, ты обретаешь многих верных сторонников (даже включая продажных наемников в тавернах, которые в последующем могут и отдаться Боэтии ради тебя). Некоторых из них имеется возможность брать в напарники, в зависимости от направленности твоего персонажа: нужен ли тебе лучник или  шут с кинжалом. Надоело рубить драконов, сражая их своим воинственным голосом? Пойдем, отыщем лук Ауриэля и будем жечь вампиров. Не хочешь? Пошли выпьем с незнакомцем в баре по кружке эля и узнаем, что тот даэдра гулянок. Хочешь тихой семейной жизни? Купи участок, построй особняк своей мечты и устройся там, может быть даже с мужем/женой и детьми. 
Устав от всех этих историй и геройств, ты можешь просто взобраться на холм под вечер с чистым небом и наблюдать за звездами. Звездные каскады - это не менее прекрасная причина прогуляться по просторам Скайрима и его окрестностям.
А для любителей мультиплеера создатели придумали онлайн версию, с которой вы можете также ознакомиться.
Но есть и свои ""-"" у сие произведения. Наиболее сущей проблемой стали для меня баги, когда я впервые зашла в официальную версию игры. Особенно по отношению к  компаньонам: передвижение в виде чистой модельки, исчезновение их частей тела, застревание в приседе, отставания от главного героя на половину карты и даже невозможность их выхода из локаций. В таких ситуациях спасают некоторые коды и частые сохранения, однако оставляет неприятный осадок. Тем не менее, это даже иногда забавляет и добавляет юмора в серые будни средневекового главного героя.

eat fish smaller or weaker, then evolve and place your new appendages? ahh ya know, like a beak or a fin, each giving attack  or speed upgrade respectively. theres also skills with certian items. after killing and collecting the parts, you get bigger fish that can hold more parts and such. for instance if you take the eyes off to put more spiky spikes, you cant see lol. well you can but its blurry as mess. cool really. so simple concept, but it becomes more deep as you play and upgrade, with things like ice or toxic sacs on enemys, spikey or armored enemys, even some environmental hazards like jellyfishys.

now, accessibilty, this game runs on rift S. it even has in game controller models.... thank you for that. anyways theres one hiccup, and thats that the left stick is your start button and right is your button to go to evolving screen. easy fix though, if you like me dont want to click the sticks in, you can map them to the A and X buttons, using steam controller configs. there should be a preset one i made at least there, or do it yourself.

there is no turning options, but there is a way to move a bit in the underwater area. sort of a dash teleport. it works fine.
other than that theres not much to it, except eating items and fish.
bought it for 50 cents, and soon it will be free. either of those are really a good deal, becuase i would reccomend this game even at a higher price, i just never found it until now. it was definately well hidden.

The influence is undeniable, and I could feel its spirit seeping through the gameplay. The campaign offers a solid, well-structured experience, while the multiplayer delivers the standard fare you’d expect from an RTS. That, in essence, is the theme of this game—it doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it delivers a polished and well-executed version of familiar mechanics.

My biggest gripe is the unit design. Many units look too similar, which can make it difficult to differentiate them at a glance. Additionally, the two main factions, while distinct in playstyle, share a somewhat uniform aesthetic, which makes them feel less visually unique than they could be.

On the positive side, the game excels in its command and control mechanics. The speed at which you can build, group, and maneuver your forces is impressive. The V key will quickly become your best friend, as it allows you to form cohesive armies that support one another effectively. However, the attack-move function can be a bit frustrating—frontline units will engage while those in the rear sometimes idle instead of pushing forward. The best workaround is to avoid attack-move and instead overshoot your target, ensuring your forces spread out and engage as intended.

If you find Ashes of the Singularity on sale and have a soft spot for Supreme Commander, it’s absolutely worth picking up. I’ve had a great time with it, and despite some minor flaws, it delivers an enjoyable large-scale RTS experience. | I wish more games would take this approach its simple but not halo wars simple(love that game too btw). | Once you get the hang of it, it is fun.

- Die Kampagne ist lahm
- Die gesamte Aufmachen, Videosequenzen, Story, Ingamegrafik, alles wirkt billig
- Die Einheiten sind nutzlos, alles unausgereift. Kaum Taktikmöglichkeiten, im Grunde geht's nur darum einen Haufen von allem zu machen, alles zusammenzuwürfeln und auf den Gegner zu werfen

The world is drawn very beautifully, and we can enjoy the game's beauty while completing the game mechanics in continuing the journey. | I have mixed feelings about this game. In the end, I'm torn between 'recommend' and 'don't recommend'....

As many reviews have said, the art style is the biggest asset. It's really beautiful, it sets a very good tone for the whole game and I feel that everything comes together well (gameplay, art, sound). 

The gameplay is not really complex, you just adjust the height of the landscape so that the old man can walk freely. But it fits somehow.

If the gameplay is like that, the story should be very good. It should be something that makes the game shine... but it isn't, at least not for me. The game is short, it took me 2 hours to complete it, so if you want to play a game instead of watching TV for an evening, it's a good choice. But for me the story didn't deliver. After the first 2 scenes/flashbacks I already had a feeling where it was all going. I suppose the developers wanted us to ask ourselves a question: ""What is most important in life?"" But for me, the story lacks a proper build-up and expansion. It feels empty. During the game you get flashbacks from the past and it's pretty easy to connect the dots of what happened... but it's really predictable, it doesn't have much depth.

I'm really torn how to rate this game. It's not a bad game, but it's not a very good game either... it's just ok. But for me, that ok wasn't enough. I feel that this game mostly focus on beautiful art style and it's not enough for me.

(MANY) POSITIVES
1 AN AMAZING PACE: OW has a brilliant mechanic of Orders that limits how much you can do in a turn. Everything, but production in cities, costs Orders: moving and using workers, scouts, army, attacking, council tasks, interactions with courtiers and nations. Each turn you think, prioritize and make choices. 
This way everything in OW feels earned. Because of the Orders limitation even in the late game a war can be exhausting for your empire. Moving many army units can deplete your Orders pool, not leaving any for workers, heir education, or scouts. Of course things get easier with time, but still you can find yourself vulnerable. One of the rare strategy games where the late game is cool!

2 CLEVER SYNERGY OF THE GAME'S SYSTEMS
In OW everything relates in a deep, satisfying way. Opinions of you impact how well armies fight, productivity of your cities, courtiers interactions with you. Resources and Buildings have efficiency combinations. All systems of OW interact.

3 TACTICAL WARS WITH PROPER AI
OW has competent AI that plays the game properly. It's perhaps a 4x game with one of the better AIs I've played against. In a war it tries to flank you for max damage, shoot from hills for maximum range, use forests to minimize ranged damage etc. War in OW is tactical. Flanking, units adjacency, terrain, and preparation (you can't heal in a neutral land, unless you have certain skills) - it all matters. 

4 DIPLOMACY IS COMPLEX AND CRUCIAL
Diplomacy in OW has two levels: internal and international with Opinions mechanic that synergizes with other systems. 
In OW you don't just establish cities of your civilization. With each new city you choose a renown family to run it (3 families each game out of 4 options; each nation has a different set). They have different bonuses, interactions with terrain, demands and limits to what character can govern their city. This way cities are different to each other. The Families opinion matters. Low Family opinion affects the maintenance of their cities. Armies you produce belong to the families and their combat effectiveness synergizes with your internal diplomacy as well (including General's opinion of you if one is added to an army).
On top of that you also have individual characters (courtiers) with friendships, love affairs, rivalry, assassinations, ambitions (power hungry), or significant public popularity (Rising Stars that can overthrow you). You also have civil wars where you may end up destroying your own city. 
Wars in OW can be intense and can significantly compromise what you can do in a turn. It really pays off to prevent war with a political marriage, even with a tribal leader against the public opinion, than risk invasions on multiple fronts. Besides, happiness in attacked cities tanks down and this can trigger further problems (unhappiness raises city's maintenance and a chance of rebellion). War in OW is a big deal: victories can boost your Legitimacy, but defeats break it. You need alliances and proper diplomacy to secure survival. You invest in building trust (Opinion) for more diplomatic options. 

5 The BARBARIANS, TRIBES AND FIXED CITY SPOTS
Besides different nations OW has Barbarians and 6 different tribes. Tribes may occupy vast or smaller map space with their camps. And the tribes in OW can be devastating. Each camp spawns units every few years and if too many they become raiders, even if you're at peace with them. You can get unexpected mini invasions where they pillage, attack cities and wound/kill workers. So your city placement, armies stationing and natural barriers like mountains play a role. 
There are benefits to defeating tribes and to alliances with them. In OW you have fixed city settlement locations. A few guaranteed ones at the start; more you get from warfare or diplomacy. I think the fixed City Spots improve the game significantly. There's no dumb AI settling a city on your border for irrational tensions. And a wide expansion makes you think and plan how you can secure distant, new cities. 
Overall, the tribes in OW add a lot of tension, threat and historical sensitivity that I really like.

6 ECONOMY WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF RESOURCE TYPES
All resources matter and you can run short of something even in the late game. Access to the best units is not just a matter of tech, but also depends on the level of your culture, a chain of buildings and multiple resources to maintain them.

7 DYNAMIC, MORTAL CHARACTERS
Playing as a mortal ruler, that you develop in stats and traits, is more fun than having one fixed option throughout eras.
I love the Archetypes for Characters, with different layers of bonuses when acting as the Leader, Governor or army Commander. For Instance a Builder Leader can assign multiple workers to a project and they have -1 turn to build improvements and more. 
It's also brilliant that courtiers' stats contribute to the resources pool of your empire. Giving them a job provides a yearly experience, thus upgrades. Using courtiers missions gives them even more experience. This way even having spy agents in foreign empires benefit your resources pool. Its a dynamic system where you want to use courtiers, they change and play an important role. 

8 EVENTS THAT BRING FLAVOR AND VARIETY
OW claims to have over 3 thousand events!!! Some go in chains and develop over time. Some involve historic characters and situations. I love that the OW events pop up with jingle sounds! Big, immersive windows with beautiful art! Love all the art of Wonders especially – they represent so well the grand scale of these projects! My favorite events are when a courtier becomes inspired by my empire's wonder (that they aren't just buildings with buffs) and when a battles winning general becomes a Rising Star and creates a political threat. It's empire AND character building together with storytelling.

9 there is DEPTH, NUANCES, AND HISTORIC SENSITIVITY
So many things in OW make it's ""world"" alive and interesting beyond the clickfest of developing tiles or attacking.
When your worker is wounded it builds a turn longer. 
When you're allied with a tribe you control their units. And when ravaged by war a Tribe can ask you for refuge, creating slums in your city. 
Scouts in OW can do many things and remain useful. From providing Legitimacy for discovered landmarks, to harvesting resources and spying. With proper tech, a Scout can establish spy network in foreign city. Then your spies can provide you with vision and destabilization options; for instance you can try to trigger rebellions in several cities at once right before you attack. All these in a Civilization like game!!!

I also like that the Tech options are semi-random.

10 ART STYLE, (fantastic) MUSIC, and ATMOSPHERE
Music in the OW is just AWESOME! Sometimes I just keep playing OW because I enjoy its soundtrack so much. 
It's a good looking game that sticks to one period of history but with depth and atmosphere. This way playtime isn't that long, but isn't short either. Due to the Orders mechanic limitations other players turns go fast, so less waiting time.

LAST BUT NOT LEAST
The game has never crashed for me.
I haven't found OW to be overwhelming to learn. It took me around 10 hours to become familiar with all the basics. OW has an excellent in-game encyclopedia.
The game is very customizable. 
The base game of OW has the full, good experience and not hiding crucial features behind paid DLCs. 
OW is first and foremost a great strategy game (with RPG flavor). It has a healthy complexity, depth, historic references, and fulfilling struggle.

NEGATIVES
In spite of symmetrical design, I've got an impression some nations are much better than others. I'm still figuring out if it's inflexibility of my playstyle or design's imbalance. | I am a university professor, game developer, and 4X TBS game fanatic. I played, developed, collaborated on, play tested, analyzed, wrote about, and searched for 4X TBS games most of my life. 
I played thousands of games and tens of thousands of hours of TBS games. I make this post after 300 hours of playing Old World. My estimated level of knowing and understanding Old World and its features: 60%.
Far from being perfect, but my perception is that Old World is currently the second best game out there. (I may be biased to 4X TBS, although I played many other genres).
Old World has the usual big problems with the UI: cumbersome, confusing, slow, buggy. Its AI seems to be somewhat better than the other 4X TBS AIs. As of today, 4X TBS AIs without exception are very poor based on my personal experience with hundreds of these games. 
But Old World’s design is one of the best I have seen so far in any 4X TBS game. Finally, I see Order Points that limit the number of actions per turn and limit my movements. I advocated for this for 30 years in 4X TBS development. This game has great feature diversity, depth, and attention to details. Many things can be customized, even the music. I am yet to try the multiplayer. The developers genuinely understand and care about their product which combo is rare to find in the 4X TBS genre. This is not just another dumbed down “clone” of an earlier game that dominates the 4X TBS market today. They still push new patches which is great. This game is similar to Civilization 4, but much better. It also has tactical depth, role playing, and probabilistic planning, and a lot more. Kudos to the developers and I wish they will provide many years of support to fix the bugs, improve the UI, further tune the balance, and strengthen the AI to make the game even better than now.
 | This game cheats during combat. Making moves the player can't make. 
The Computer always has 2,000 Shields, which allows it to Force March troops, even after spending all of those points to move troops or attack. 
EVERY army the AI has, has a General in it. 
The AI brings back Generals the next turn.
It's oppressive. 
90% of the Events that happen are bad for you, or negative, or cause negative effects.
It's way too hard to be peaceful and ally with another nation. 
No matter what you do, what tech you have, or how good you are with other AI players, they backstab you.
The Orders system is F'd, because you're restricted every turn, and you can't DO everything you need to do in your turn, like fight a war. If your king/queen has less Orders (moves) than the enemy and you have to fight a war, you're already dead. I hate it. 
I've been trying to deal with this since I got the game, and have disliked it, and the further I get into a game, the worse it becomes. This ONE issue is enough to make me never play it again.

I've been spending up to 12 hours a day in this game for days now, and it's just stupidly overpowered against the player. Just when you start to get things right, the game sh_its on you. I had a few years of absolute peace, and building up my army and building up my cities, only to get absolutely rolled by the AI, who always had better tech, had more troops, and never ran out of Generals. 
The movement across mountains, or using more Shield points than it should have to move troops is what did it for me. 
I know the AI cheats in every game vs. Humans, but this is ridiculous. 
F this game. It's got so many problems that Civ doesn't have. It's like they looked at Civ and went, ""You know, how do we make the game way harder, and more difficult at the same time?...

Old World looks, feels and plays like it was made by 4X fans for 4X fans. It remedies so many of the genre's pitfalls, and the replay value is through the roof. The mix of nations, families, events and characters give each and every game a different flavour. The developers have also kept it consistently patched and tweaked. Cannot recommend it enough, this game beats any other in the genre. | Eine Partie Old World zu spielen ist für mich immer etwas besonderes.Jedesmal erlebe ich eine neue Geschichte und es ist einfach spannend.Fazinierend wie die Entwickler dieses auf die Beine gestellt haben.Wie die ganzen Mechaniken im Spiel ineinander greifen und ein so motivierendes immersives Spielerlebnis erzeugen.
Vorausgesetzt man lässt sich darauf ein.Denn es kann auch hart sein eine Partie zu spielen.Es kann frustrierend sein schlechte Zeiten zu überwinden oder mit  mehreren Kriegen konfrontiert zu werden.Sich dort durchzusetzen macht auch einen besonderen Reiz von Old World  aus.Für mich das beste 4x Game auf dem Markt.

76561197970698176,599140,Unknown,15.85,,17,"A game that while i first enjoyed on console replaying it on PC reminded me how good yet how AWFUL this game is. A great game with and interesting story and fun mechanics to start. But horribly grindy later on with the story falling over time and ending in... an interesting way. A game i have with a love-hate relationship with and likely will play again only to feel more disappointed. | This game is hard to recommend so I won't.  TLDR;  Feels like a game that had a rushed and patchy finish with features being dropped or stripped.  Late game is a huge disappointment.   Zero replay-ability.

Late game brings what initially promises to be automation using zombies.  But apart from wood collection all other zombie jobs just make more work for you.  So the early game grind gets replaced with late game grind supporting the zombies.  The zombie farmers need to be restarted each time and the gold seeds they're using slowly diminish leaving you with the side job of hand growing more seeds.  The vineyard is up a cliff right next to your house but you have to run half across the map to get to it.  Gets very annoying and there is no late game staircase to get you up there quickly.

Corpse processing becomes a bore and almost pointless once the graveyard is full.  I would have expected ashes to be handled properly such as needing to put them in an urn right after you burn the body.  Instead you just collect your ash arbitrarily in stacks and craft the urns in your...kitchen?  In the end I found myself processing corpses only to collect blood to feed my speed potion habit because the game quickly becomes intolerable without it.  And with a maximum of one blood per day available you need to conserve those potions. 

The dungeon is a random collection of halls leading to pointless rooms with no rhyme or reason.  It feels like a complete afterthought.  Maybe just checking a box for the screenshot.  The lighting is bland and uniform throughout.  No mood lighting.  No ambient sound.  On the plus side combat is much better than most other games similar to this.  

The restrictions on placing workbenches etc seems like a half baked idea which just ends up being annoying.  You can't move things, only destroy them, losing most of the materials.  Since you have no idea what you're going to add later in the game you are forced to destroy and rebuild in order to fit new stuff in. Quality of life aspects like this seem to have been overlooked.

The church was the biggest let down for me.  I was so keen to get the final upgrade and bling out my cathedral to the nines.  But that never happened.  There are very few late game things that can be added.  You simply don't get extra bench rows.  There are no crucifixes, no fonts, no bells, no memorials.  The stain glass window was in my build menu for a long time and I was looking forward to the moment a glorious and massive, bright new stain glass window would twinkle in the central position at the head of the church.  It would be it's pride and joy!   Nope.  It's a tiny, dull turd of a sprite with no effects that you can only only place on the side.  The church is one of the central things in the game and a wonderful opportunity to let the player get creative.  It failed to provide that.

The alchemy felt like a lot of extra bloat was added by making it so each reagent has a powder, liquid and extract form and sometimes a goo form.  The trial and error style of finding new recipes is asking way too much of the player forcing wiki lookups in order to maintain sanity.

Quests were a mixed bag. Some were ok but many can be summarised as fetch quests involving many people and so many things to fetch or make or grow in a sequence.  Some of those characters only show up once a week leading to annoying delays in story progression.  Some quests will even have this delay with a single character who will say something to the effect ""Ah, great, you got that thing for me.  Come back next week and I'll give the thing I promised""  Ugh!

It's a no. | This is a mixed review honestly, the game starts off great but really falls off near the end unfortunately. It has a great art style and a good soundtrack, the writing is above average, overall it's a chill and relaxing game. 

The shortcomings it has are small but numerous, such as tasks becoming a slow and painful chore, poor UI such as workbenches not being able to bulk craft some recipes for no real reason, not being able to cancel crafts, e.t.c. It's a lot less sandboxy that what I expected, which was a letdown, as the Church turned out to be a disappointment in the way you can build inside. 

Overall, decent game, not for everyone, but not bad... 6.5/10 | Complex yet simple to learn.
Its way easier to reach automation comparing to the similar games in the genre. and heck thats satisfying!!!

76561197970698176,611670,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR,2.5166666666666666,RPG,2,"One of the worst VR experiences I’ve ever had was booting up this mess unmodded . Don’t even bother trying it in its vanilla state!

It’s a lazy, poorly optimized port that’s definitely not worth the money on its own. Thankfully, the amazing modding community has transformed this disaster into one of the best VR games available today. They’re essentially doing Bethesda’s job for free, fixing issues and enhancing the experience while the company reaps the profits.

That said, I highly recommend giving it a try—but be prepared to spend time modding and dealing with a ton of bugs and issues that are coming from vanilla Skyrim. Just know that when you buy this, you’re basically paying for the game engine to run your mods, not an actual game.,. | Should you play this game even with Bethesda's typical pattern of not including basic VR features that then had to be fixed by modding? Sure, why not. Whenever it is on sale for at least $30 USD. Just be prepared to spend extra time downloading mods to make the video game more tolerable, as per usual.

Is it the best VR game out there even with those VR mods? No, not really. The community overstates just how good VR Skyrim is, and I say this as somebody who has over 300 hours on the original 32-bit version that was liable to crash after installing more than five mods, and then another 300+ hours on the 64-bit version.

With VR, I feel like Bethesda saw it as yet another opportunity to re-release Skyrim for the sixth time (instead of working on ES6) while justifying the premium price tag on a 13+ year-old video game probably because it's a more unique experience compared to the other versions of Skyrim. But it being Skyrim is really the superglue that deters it from crumbling, because playing it in VR, you are actually sacrificing a lot of graphical beauty that you can achieve instead with modding the special edition version and just playing how we have been since the 1990s on a monitor and with your mouse and keyboard. Even an RTX 4090 is put to quite the stress test for VR when you install graphical and texture improvement mods to beautify a rather old video game, and 'vanilla' Skyrim, especially as VR, does not hold up to time and looks ugly without those mods. I'm not usually one to complain about a video game not having good graphics, I quite literally play any type of video game, but I just don't know how much I'd be able to tolerate if I had to replay bland, outdated and unmodded Skyrim.

Bethesda, if anything, seemed to want to rush this out instead of making it a true VR experience like [i]Half-Life: Alyx[/i] was. You don't get to physically reach out and watch as your character's hand turns a door knob to which you can push or pull on it. You literally just aim your hand at the door to see the prompt, and press the A button (or whatever the 'interaction' keybind is set to) just like you would if you were playing on a keyboard and mouse or a regular Xbox/PS controller. Sure, you can still pick up and throw (some) smaller items like the abundance of gross cabbage that no Nord wants to eat because it isn't meat, but the problem with Bethesda's design here is that VR controllers really don't have enough buttons and inputs built into the controllers, and so you're playing a video game that has far too many key binds and inputs for what you are given. Yet again, mods have to be used to try and create a more seamless experience with less menu browsing to swap between spells or arrows or whatever your character utilizes, as having to play a pause and menu simulator in VR sort of ruins the immersive expectation that comes with VR. But the lack of interaction with the world around you as you can reach out and try to grip things just makes it feel like you're playing a video game with an Xbox/PS controller while just wearing a VR headset. It's just pointless. 

With the unique perspective that you do get to play in, spell casting is actually pretty fun, and archery is even better. As someone who never really had much issue with aiming a bow in Skyrim on the mouse, it's such a fun experience trying to use it in VR where you have to physically draw and nock the arrow. It's so much more challenging and actually really satisfying when you learn how to connect those long ranged shots. I was more invested in becoming an expert bowman than my usual playstyle: a warrior, and my build for Skyrim in VR focused primarily on archery.

The combat is still what you can expect from Bethesda and their outdated systems, though, so nothing has really improved here. It just seems more interesting because it's VR but if you are familiar with Skyrim then you know how to exploit the engine. You can literally walk backwards as hostile NPCs swing their weaponry at you and they can't even hit you. I think this might be from the movement speed being maximized by default, and you can make yourself slower, but that also makes traveling tedious until you get your mount and so the speed-walking is really ideal until then. I guess I will admit still that slapping someone across the face with a mace and watching them fall over is pretty satisfying, but Bethesda games have always had this sort of 'clunk' to its combat and that isn't rectified in the VR version. You can also cheese the fights with melee by just pointing your sword at an enemy and wiggling the controller as if you're an old person shaking your cane at annoying kids. Overall, it's still a pretty easy game even on harder difficulties as I don't think Bethesda ever figured out how to properly balance their game and VR just lets you find additional methods to exploiting their dumb AI coding.

Because we all know Skyrim by now, this is less about the story of the game and more about the VR experience of it. While it was fun exploring Skyrim in VR after last playing the game years ago, I just don't know if Bethesda was truly ready for designing a VR game or if Skyrim (and maybe even Fallout) are the franchises for it. There's so much more that could have been done given what we see of other VR titles that are built for VR from its very foundation. The technology for VR also might not be good enough for such large open-world video games where Skyrim is concerned. Skyrim, at its core, already has loading screens for pretty much everything so even modern technology might not be ready for video games that have seamless loading rather than pausing to load during a black screen with some gameplay hints on it.

While I wasn't disappointed with Skyrim's VR edition, I simply don't think it was good enough for VR and I don't think a game this old should still be sold for $60, VR or not. Fortunately, I think this is the last re-release of Skyrim that Bethesda will have. | Only playable with mods, like Mad God's modlist. With that, it's unbelievably fun. The mad god modlist via wabbajack is seriously a one-click install and play solution that works right out of the box. You gotta do some tinkering to get the settings just right for your setup so that the gameplay is a little more smooth, but once you do that you're in for hours of fun. VRDad on Youtube is a great resource for getting it all going. | This is the 3x time they try to sell the same game for you, Skyrim, Special Edition and VR. Considering this is a full price game, you expect at least some real integration with VR. That don´t exist, what you see in videos are created mods. | As others have pointed out, use mods. Get the recommended basics, mod managers are your friend. I opted for Vortex. I learned how to fix mods, textures, and scripts on my own as you can spend more time reading how to install mods than playing modded SkyrimVR.

I have a Frankenstein of a modded save that is beautiful and still somehow works, and is really fun. 

In conclusion: 
Do not get too attached to your save.
Can't wait for Skyblivion.

[h1]Com toda certeza, um dos melhores jogos de ritmo para VR já feito...[/h1]

[b]Sem sombras de dúvidas um dos melhores já feito, praticamente sem concorrência, eu já joguei muito ele no Quest 2 standlone, umas 80, 90 horas, isso se não for mais, jogo ele também no Quest 3 standlone e depois de anos, finalmente comprei no PC e jogo sempre que possível, o jogo realmente é incrível, sem conta os [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2087115113]mods[/url] que deixam ele ainda melhor, é de fato uma das melhores experiências que eu já tive em um jogo de ritmo, desde o Guitar Hero...[/b]

Mas vamos aos fatos, que, como podem ver, depois de muitos updates, a Beat Games (que são responsáveis por desenvolver o jogo), ter feito descaso com modders, e lançando updates que fazem o Beat Saber [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2263141699]não ser compatível com mods[/url] (sem conta que eu acho que seria incrível ter uma [b]workshop[/b] dedicada diretamente do Steam), sendo obrigado a utilizar versões mais antigas, e até problemas que deixava o jogo no PC injogável, como o clássico problema com [b]stuttering[/b], aqueles travamentos chatos que atrapalha demais quando se trata de jogo de ritmo, em que você não pode errar nem mesmo por [b]1 milissegundo[/b], um [b]jogo de ritmo precisa estar estável a todo momento[/b], independente do que aconteça, e o Beat Saber vem sofrendo disso há anos, é só procurar em foruns, a aba de discussões do Steam, em todo lugar você vai ver que, muitos relatam isso depois de certos updates que o jogo teve, não importa qual seja seu hardware, tenha uma GTX 1070 ou uma RTX 4080, você vai sofrer com alguns travamentos chatos, sem explicação, e não importa a configuração que você faça, vai acontecer do mesmo jeito, é um problema que tem no jogo, algo crônico, que deve ser possível resolver com um simples patch, mas a Beat Games praticamente não percebe isso já faz muito tempo...

Enfim, é um ótimo jogo, não tenho palavras para descrever o quão bom é joga-lo, [b]mas que com o passar dos anos, parece que a Beat Games simplesmente não escuta mais a sua comunidade, e praticamente não resolve os verdadeiros problemas que o jogo tem, deixando muitos insatifeitos e tendo que resolver por conta própria[/b], isso é lamentável vindo de um [b]título indispensável[/b] como esse, para quem tem VR e gosta de jogos de ritmo, [b]precisa jogar beat saber[/b], mas já deixando claro que, ele é um ótimo jogo, mas tem seus defeitos, sem conta essa que para utilizar [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2087115113]mods[/url], precisa fazer downgrade na versão atual para uma mais antiga...

[spoiler]Dito isso, eu recomendo que, se você realmente quer ter o Beat Saber, [b]compre apenas a versão base[/b] e utilize as versões mais antigas, modifique o quanto quiser e tente procurar soluções para alguns desses problemas com stuttering que acaba acontecendo, mas caso não tem tanta certeza se realmente vai gostar ou não quer lidar com alguns desses problemas, então recomendo que não compre, e tente procurar outras formas de joga-lo, se é que me entende...

That’s why, I played more than 400 hours and tried to give the developers constructive feedback and even crunched the numbers to improve the meta. But with each update since the introduction of the troll, the game gets less fun to play. The developer’s either doesn’t care or are unable to properly develop their game. Updates take literally years to publish and don’t take player feedback into account.

Here are the things, which make the game not fun or outright tedious to play:
- Once fun gameplay mechanics, like hunting and skinning animals for pelts, got gated behind perks.
- Choosing survival or utility perks is punishing to the player, because you will have to foregone a badly needed combat perk. Survival perks will gimp your build.
- Magic got nerfed into oblivion and is not fun to play anymore.
- Some perks and builds are much more powerful than others. Respecing is impossible, and thus the player can get permanently punished for trying new perks.
- The economy doesn’t make sense. Equipment is worthless, when you want to sell it and treasure, when you want to buy it.
- With the save system, I had no problem before. But with the expanded map, dying means hours of gameplay lost upon death.
- The most glaring fault of the game for me is the map. The game is huge and has over 1000 tiles to explore, but nothing to make exploration worth it or fun. At this point, the game is a pointless walking simulator. Even the caravan update only slightly addresses this issue. The map remains mostly empty and exploration pointless. 


[b] TLDR: The game is a walking simulator with incredibly slow development. Wait until development has finished in 10 years and then maybe pick the game up. [/b]



[u] Edit - 19.02.25 - reply to the developer [/u]

@Wayfinder Thanks for taking the time to write a reply. I want to address each of the points you made.

1. Review based on previous version: I watched gameplay of the changes made in the recent updates to decide, if I wanted to give Stoneshard a spin after all those disappointing trials after other updates before. The gameplay convinced me, that not enough has changed to warrant another unsatisfactory test. 

2. Skinning: Skinning is challenging for a modern day person, but not for a medieval person. Every farmer, knight, hunter and many more people knew how to skin an animal, because it was necessary in everyday life. Mercenaries had to forage almost daily, and skinning was a regularly occurring activity. 
The less reliable way to receive hides is just a stopgap for the missing ability to skin. The community complained a long time about the missing skinning feature, before the development acted upon it. 
There is no need to decrease the price of pelts, when skinning is a common skill. Wild animals in Stoneshard are extremely dangerous. Good pelt prizes would make fighting them worth the risk of losing one’s live. Normal farmers would never risk their lives for a pelt. This makes them a rare and valuable commodity.  Right now, it's better to not engage animals most of the time, making a whole class of enemies almost obsolete.

2. Fan base & development: The current community consists mostly of diehard fans. They accept pretty much anything the development of the game decides. Almost all other supporters have left by now, because the development is so incredibly slow, and it takes ages (sometimes years) before player feedback is acted upon. In the past, instead of acting upon player feedback, like implementing custom characters, new mechanics nobody had asked for like bird hunting or nerfs to magic got introduced. 
Clearly, the developers have a vision for this game. To realize this vision, player feedback can only be implemented as long as it doesn’t collide with it. I can respect a vision. But my point about not acting upon the roadmap and feedback is clearly shown in the course of the development and past updates.  

3. Pathfinder: That pathfinder is considered a must-have skill for all builds underscores my point, that the skills are not well-balanced. If every build needs a certain skill to be viable, it constricts the build options and the ways, the game can be played. 

4. Survival perks: because of the still occurring difficulty jumps, some combat skills are necessary to survive. Picking a survival perk instead, even with some good passive bonuses, will negatively impact the combat performance of the player and thus gimp the build. From the gameplay I have seen, this has not changed. It is just not as pronounced as before, because the survival skills are not as useless for combat as before. 

5. Magic: You give no argument, just state a different opinion. Magic was nerfed hard in comparison to past versions. For beginner’s magic is much harder to get into, than melee oriented builds. With magic, the player must know how to kite, how to let spells cooldown while keeping the distance from enemies. It's a much more skill intensive play style at the beginning of the game. 

6. Economy: Just because many other RPGs do the same, it doesn't make a feature good nor necessary. 

7. Losing progress upon dying: My review explains what new players can expect to happen on a normal play through. Stoneshard doesn't explain many of its mechanics very well and is a hard game to begin with. I would estimate a new player needs at least 20 hours of gameplay to learn about the game, to not die regularly. Dying regularly means losing hours of progress in the course of a play through, even with careful use of all possible save points. 
Stoneshard being a mercenary RPG rather than a roguelike, has no need for the restricting save system. It only punishes new players. 
I personally very seldom die. But I have over 400 hours of experience in the game. It's not something that can be expected of regular players and is one of the reasons I can't recommend Stoneshard to people considering buying it. 

8. Exploration couldn't have been worse before. It was an almost empty map with nothing of value to discover. There were bandits with worthless gear, wild animals without any substantial loot and some dungeon in between. The dungeon is better tackled with a contract anyway, because then there is a payday at the end. 
Very few places explain more about the world and let you connect to the people of Stoneshard. The only difference to before the last update is, now there are some places sprinkled in between with something worth looting. 
It would have been better to either keep the map small but engaging, like it was before the troll update. If Stoneshard has to have a big map in the developer’s vision, it would have been better to have gone the way the game “Kenshi” has gone before – a carefully crafted map with secret lore to uncover, different biomes and cultures to interact with. But this would have been a lot of additional work. Stoneshard right now has the content of a small map stretched over a big map. The result is a world which feels like it lacks engaging content to make it feel alive.

9. If in the future the game will be finished, I'm willing to give it another try and even change my review to positive, if the game deserves a recommendation. Right now I don't think the game is worth the asking price. | The game is hard, and I mean hard hard.

It also has lore, and fun banter between the characters to read between levels. 
My favourite is Jarlaxle. 

But the games monetization is very egregious. Over 200 quids ""worth"" of DLC and an in game store with loot boxes. 
You can get these in game, which is at least a plus, but it feels like an advertisement, the way they are drip fed to you.
And when I say worth, there's a pack in the game, that comes with an autoclicking raccoon (Trash Panda) and some potions, it says it's 35 quids worth at the cost of 15 quid.
That is not 35 quids worth. Some potions and an admittedly very cute, Raccoon are not worth 35 quid... If you think that, then you're just incorrect. Factually false.

If you're content to leave the game on in the background, that's not a problem. You'll eventually get things that will be left in the background. There's also codes you can enter for free chests, which is nice. A point in the games favour.

But I cannot recommend this game, on the basis that it is so greedy. So many micro-transactions. You can potentially spend hundreds of pounds on a game that you leave on in the background. 

If you are not the kind to fall prey to microtransactions, then yes, by all means, get this game, leave it on in the background, and enjoy. But if you are... then avoid it at all costs! Because this game will ride you hard and take you for everything you've got. | Un univers qu'on apprécie

I think there biggest problem with this game is that it rewards camping too much over objective taking to the point that you're just shooting bots whom are not very engaging on their own. On the contrary, if you're attempting to overtake some objectives, the bots overpower you with sheer numbers by swarming you. So it becomes a vicious cycle of just further rewarding camping in one spot which the few players you meet typically do making it a camp fest.

I would say it is in a better direction than the previous game (Verdun) in that the multiple objective path system makes it more versatile and engaging to overtake objectives. | Im Vergleich zu Battlefield 1 finde ich dieses Kriegsspiel einfach der Hammer!

76561197970698176,505700,Anyland,0.0166666666666666,"Adventure, Casual, Indie, Massively Multiplayer",0,"I had always had VR on my mind. Just the thought of being transported into another world was what I always dreamed of. However, when I finally configured all the hardware needed for VR, I was slightly disappointed in what software options I had. ‘Let’s make something that people are used to’ some of the developers agreed.  The zombie shooters the space traders the walking simulators the gun simulators, they never really appealed to me. Even the new social hubs offered very little. In a surge of desperation, I frantically scrolled through the endless streams of steam reviews, looking for that hidden gem the one application to shine above the rest. Then from out of nowhere I found it. An application with positive user reviews and a compassionate community. I had found my Anyland. I thought to myself, what have I got to lose and downloaded it. It makes me smile now to believe that I did what most new players in Anyland do when they find their own biscuit in space. I made a few objects a table, a desk lamp, half a wall and a flowerpot and then I closed the app. 3 months later; I don’t know why, I re-opened Anyland and stumbled upon the areas button. What was this ? I hit an interesting nightclub link and then something special happened to me. I was suddenly surrounded by a rich area full of colours and music. For over an hour I danced to myself. Here I was with a nightclub to myself, my face started hurting from my smile pushing against the headset. This is what I wanted. I’m happy to role play this I heard myself saying.  It’s funny to look back but I still thought that this was the creation of a crazed developer and my introduction to scripting my first head, a daft punk stylized which was to later haunt me was just part of the fun. However, on my second visit to the nightclub the day after, a whole new world opened up to me. Suddenly one avatar appeared on the dance floor follow by, two then four five six all at once all animated. Closer they curiously looked at me. A double take later and I carried on with my fun, thinking nothing of it. One of the green haired avatars stood next to me and spoke. 
“Hey let me show you” his hands frantically flicking switches. 
What! This was no NPC but someone real.  In shock I replied “W-Who are you W-Who made this ?”
His head slowly turned to me and in a curious tilt and spoke again. 
“What? I made this.” I heard that comforting ‘ting’ sound you get when you complete an object, however this time I never even touched the ‘done‘ button. This is what Anyland was about! From that moment I was hooked. It reminded me of the first time I played Minecraft, completely new to the world without a clue of what everything did but by Jove was I going to find out. Quickly I soon got to meet with lots of people who had already placed hours of effort into great worlds and objects. Always happy to share not only with their creations but the skills they had learned. 
So, it was time to create something. A player called Fazzi was halfway into creating a vast city world and was starting to link not only his worlds but allowing others to link to his. 
“Do you want an apartment?” He asked me during one of my idea walks. 
“You can do that ? What’s the catch ?” I smirked, Fazzi laughed 
“No catch, all you have to do is to make a room that looks like an apartment. It can be as big or as small as you want and I’ll link it for you.“ He replied.
“To here; your world, Wow ok thanks!” I said with pleasure. 
The challenge was on. It reminded me of the time I tried to create my parents’ house in an old 3D renderer. Could I do the same in VR? I certainly was going to try to find out. To help Graphics Monkey my new Anyland neighbour would pop in now and then for a friendly cup of VR tea to give me hints and tips. The amount of effort he placed into objects astounded me. I was never going to be as good that I said to myself, and you know secretly I’m still not. In other areas other players started to show their talents. Murky and his amazing vision to recreate Doom in VR before doom was even available, Walker and his amazing imagination, Spider and his awesome masks and atmospheric areas and many others. On the other side of the world The Americans starting to show their expertise in firearms, scripted wonders and vast areas of fantasy and wonder. I had learned from the legends, the players that had blossomed and moved on but with that legacy were left the foundations upon what Anyland had become. Anyland had become a family of faces that drew you in every time you wanted to escape the real world.  
With the apartment now complete it was time to create my first project. What on earth could I create that would be unique? Inspired by Graphics Monkey’s time traveling antics I decided to think of what my apartment would have looked like 300 years into the past. I quickly drew up a few random shapes of a medieval street and laid it down as a template. It sat there for weeks on end, tempting me to start. Brick after brick it slowly formed. I remember the first days of looking at the bland white inner template thinking that I had taken on too much. But gradually it took form and I started to invite people in to view. It always gives me a buzz when someone new says “wow.” and to think it all started with one brick and a template created in 2 minutes. 
With the apartment and Tavern complete I started to gain new friends. Hanging out became a huge part of the game over the creative side. Anyland is a sharing community and the showing of new projects and new techniques is mesmerizingly addictive. The Anyland community became my inspiration. From then onwards I started to get my kicks out of helping others and taking some of their innovative ideas to another level. 
Everyone can remember the first time they meet thy maker and my moment was as magical as all the others I have spoken to. It’s kind of a spiritual moment in Anyland. Philipp the seen developer of Anyland and as expected gets a mountain of attention when he is online. But I will always remember the moment of calm where I was able to thank him personally for all the time and effort put into his amazing creation. 
Ironically one of the amazing things about Anyland is keeping up with the developers. From the active forums you can kind of gauge what the next update might be. However, the talented team are notorious for releasing updates that turn the world upside down. I always remember the time when textures got preleased. Like polygon drugs, new objects secretly got shared around the community, until virtually everyone had them. Then it’s the big rush for someone to come up with a use for an update before anyone else. The ones that stand out are ones that seem to be just normal bug fixes but some side effects or features as we like to call them drastically alter our perception of reality. Normally with the developers unware of the mass hysteria occurring.  
Meeting people in Anyland used to be harder than it is today. Like MUDS of the past you could accidently bump into players in the strangest of places. As Anyland has a steep learning curve it became apparent that some new players might need a helping hand and with so many helpful players about Anyland births is a way that you are always welcomed to the world with an experienced player before you start. This became an inportant thing for me. I was hooked on getting new players hooked. The last thing I always said with an Axel tour was “All that I have shown you is available to you. All you need is time and your amazing imagination.” | On my first visit in Anyland i dropped onto an island, its evening, there are a couple of torches, some rocks, a hotdog and a raygun.
I play with the raygun and eat the hotdog, then a birdperson (birdlike avatar) walks up and says ""hi!""
I ask if he has made this world, ""nah, just some small stuff and the moon"".
I look up and theres a huge smiley faced moon hanging in the sky.
My mind is blown, i realize that this is a strong first step towards the metaverse we all know from the classic books, a fully player created space, i break down laughing.
Mr Bird pulls a piano from his sleeve and starts playing a tune, i laugh even harder.
I escape back to my empty starting area, sit down on the floor and repeat ""holy shit"" to myself a couple of times.

Anyland is a wonderful place and its only going to get better :) | I have been sleeping in Virtual Reality for the past 4 days...
Seriously.
I do other things, of course- but when all is done- I find my time re-creating my room from reality- importing it bit by bit into the alternate world created by my own digital hands.
This is amazing- this program ""Anyland"" coupled with room-scale virtual reality- allows for a user to create forms with function- to easily animate them or treat them like solid objects for other people to walk on.
At this moment I have my entire living area mapped out and brought into VR. I just finished my desk in the back, changed the walls into a nice metal/glass combo, made monitors and my computer, created a nice table with measurements built in- equal to reality.
How I map my room into VR:
I stand there in the digital void, and feel an object in front of me with my physical hands- I then create a digital object to serve as a glowing pin suspended in the air and pin this to each corner of the physical object- in VR. Once I have the measurements, I quickly create a large rough polygon with my digital hands, resizing quickly to fill out the shape. I set the color and then decide if I want any additional functionality.
For most furniture items I set no further options, as I do not want other users entering my universe to start flipping the desk for fun.
For most other items, I set options to make the object ""holdable"". This will create a copy of the object in the user's hand 6 they attempt to ""grab"" the digital item.
I can easily add an animation to an object-but think of this- when you animate an item in Virtual Reality, and are standing there amongst objects of your creation, the animated object feels very ""real"".
The process of animation is very easy-
Example of animating the blink of an eyelid:
Select eyelid object
Once selected, a screen will appear, showing ""1"",""2""
These are the key frames in the action list
By default they are empty, but you can click on ""2"", move the item, click back on ""1"" and see the item jump back and forth/ only doing so when you click the buttons marked ""1"", and ""2""
But if we wanted to make the thing animate on its own, we click on ""1"" and select the commands that pop up in this order:
When starts then become next in 1s
It's easy.
You then click on 2, and under the command list, the bottom option will be the last used command- like a shortcut for your history.
When starts then become next in 1s
Next for the last position cycles back- so this animation will cycle between frame 1 and frame 2, every 1s- forever.
Now imagine that instead of it just cycling, it waited for a command-
Anyland allows for many triggers:
When:
Touched
Consumed
Held
Thrown
Nearby
Touched by
Etc
So, if we wanted a shining red crystal floating in the air in front of us to activate a door that opens vertically upon a touch- the process is very easy and very awesome
Best way to describe this is- 
Ready player one
Or your dreams come true.
You could sit there and recreate the entire movie of Jurassic park to become an interactive virtual reality experience if you just took the time. You could create full sized animated raptors, full sized animated t-Rex stepping on a full sized jeep, next to a full sized moat-cliff, near full sized giant trees, near full sized giant brachiosaurus that were animated eating leaves.
Understand that this is not like a ""video game""
This is virtual reality..
And I really have been sleeping in VR.
I pull up a nice documentary on my virtual television and slip on my virtual sleeping bag- animated to expand and contract with each breath.
Funny thing is people still show up in my virtual room even when I'm sleeping. They stand over me and watch me. Some even put something relaxing on the television for me.

I know it says I have 1700 hours in this game, but that's not actually true--I played hundreds of hours on PS3 before this game even launched on PC. I've also played Lol, DotA, Smite, HotS... if you can think of a MOBA, I probably at least tried it, and a few of those a sank hundreds of hours into.

This game is unapproachable for new and returning players, as the bots do not offer a significant challenge and matchmaking lobbies are filled with players who have simply been playing the game longer than you. There is no skilled matchmaking, so picking up and learning this game is just not worth the mental effort.

Sadly, Atari won't be able to revive a game reliant on its online, when new player hostility is this bad.

Great game. Terrible playerbase. | I played the version on the ps3 first and even with the current reversion its still a killer game. You will not be able to play every character due to some being behind old dlc that isn't available but the selection is still better than the ps3 version.

---致我人生第一次玩的卡牌肉鸽神作《杀戮尖塔》
前几日冬促，购买了《杀戮尖塔》这款游戏，在玩之前心里曾想：我玩过那么多个3A大作，怎能会被一个小小的卡牌游戏震撼呢？看着steam好评如潮的评价，心里抱着不理解和尝试的态度，还是打开了游戏。

没错，我摊牌了，我彻底被这个游戏折服，从买完游戏到现在我无时不刻都在玩，目前也差不多一百小时了，如此优秀的游戏玩法和质量已经能超越很多3A大作。

再玩之前，我也确实久仰杀戮尖塔在卡牌肉鸽当中的地位，但是我也确实从来没玩过卡牌肉鸽，《杀戮尖塔》也属于我在肉鸽类游戏中的白月光了吧。确实只有在实际上手之后才能感受到其中的魅力。从最开始的重开在商店里找好遗物，到现在稍微有些对删牌过卡的理解，这种不完全依赖随机而是能够在游戏局内运营、构筑卡牌的机制正是它的魅力所在。同时四个角色特色迥异，相同角色又因为不同的牌组构筑有着不同的打法，再加上几乎毫无门槛的操作，在roguelike游戏的重开-学习的过程中，低挫败感、高成就感、对卡牌的熟悉以及逐渐对角色的理解使得游戏过程不像通常的卡牌roguelike，而更加有趣，能取舍是否该拿牌、是否该移除卡牌、接下来又该怎么构筑，这使该游戏的可重复游玩性大大增加。


前些天终于用战士，猎人和鸡煲把心脏打通关了，也算是对这游戏有些浅薄的理解了

开始玩这游戏的时候，好哥们建议我先玩鸡煲，说是鸡煲转起来特别强，而我也感受到了。

后来哥们和我说，玩战士得学会烧牌，我很诧异，明明每张牌都是我精挑细选的，为什么要把他们烧掉呢？后面理解了，把效率低的卡烧掉后，留下单卡效率最高的卡，打怪效率更高。之后喜欢上了烧牌的感觉，尤其很喜欢腐化，当把其他牌烧干净后，只剩下那几张攻击牌，颇有种破釜沉舟的感觉，就算打不过再sl嘛，把不该烧的牌留下来。

当我研究战士烧牌的时候，我认为战士是一个最需要想象力的职业，玩的时候得靠想象力。

关于杀戮尖塔的赞美太多太多了，我不想去赞美游戏的本身。我印象最深刻的一局是战士第一次打败心脏，因为卡组不太好，强度不高。我腐化黑拥SL一个小时二十次，结局依旧是输。我相信我能赢，我把29张牌牌序列出来，腐化黑拥烧完不同的牌牌序列出来，一个小时后我终于找到了那个解，最后我赢了之后长舒一口气。在那一刻我赢了游戏，在那一刻也赢了时间。或许一个小时我重开一局选牌好早赢了，可是能赢的局我不愿认输。


即使最后我们都会输给时间，这没关系，那也要谱写出每个人自己生命的赞歌。什么是生命的赞歌？或许是藏在人们骨子里的永不屈服、永不妥协、永不认输。

我的人生没办法sl，为了战胜这一路上的小怪，烧过那么多休息牌，娱乐牌，还换了那么多血，这是否真的值得？可惜这个问题的答案没法通过sl去知道了。
现在的我，就想赶快走到下一个篝火休息。人生啊，总是奔向下一个篝火，区别是以前的我会在篝火敲牌，以后我只会休息了。

最后感谢《杀戮尖塔》给我带来一百小时的快乐时光，我现在唯一后悔的就是在大学期末考试期间购买了这款游戏，这游戏真的有瘾啊！😭 | 又开始带鸡煲节奏了我真是服了😅鸡煲是这个游戏唯一的完美职业，已经和尖塔融为一体，成了尖塔的底层逻辑，成名绝技偏差认知给尖塔带来了这个贴吧最经典的话题，创造了尖塔的黄金时代，诋毁鸡煲，你想毁了杀戮尖塔吗？
 | My first 500 hours in Slay the Spire were hours I didn't pay for. 

I was a kid in highschool, broke, there was only 3 characters in the game, Vine was alive and Tiktok had yet to really get a foothold in the world. It was a better time.

And I... sailed the seas. Its not something I'm ashamed of, and if you are down on your luck, still a kid, or just don't feel like jockeying the Steam refund policy to see if you like a game, most game devs would prefer thats how you play their game over buying a copy of dubious origin from a reseller. 

Why even bring this up, you might ask? Well, it was only last year that I realized how much had gone into the game, and that there was a 4th character that I had no clue even existed. And, against my better judgement with regards to my ever disappearing free time, I picked up STS again to try that 4th character. And then I started playing the other characters too. And then I started ascension runs. 

Never in all my days have I encountered such a well crafted deckbuilder. Being singleplayer, STS doesn't care if you find a combo that breaks the game and makes the enemy unable to interact with you. Slay the Spire doesn't try and limit your ceiling, it dares you to go infinite, it [i] wants [/i] you to go infinite. My favorite part of the game is how it encourages offense while putting more than enough wrinkles in your path that you can't just go full zerg rush. Fully indexing into any one thing without accounting for the counters puts you on the path to losing. 

Learning the Watcher, the illusive 4th character I didn't know existed as it got added after I put my 500 [strike] pirated [/strike] pre-purchase hours in has been one of the most enjoyable deckbuilding experiences I've had since... well since I played STS the first time. 

The main thing I was trying to do on the Watcher that was so fun was going infinite. There was a really interesting play pattern you can take where you reset a lot and chop your deck down to like 3 powers and then your 2 card combo that goes until you win. The fun part is that by taking your deck down to so few cards, any enemy that adds cards to your deck in any way is immediately the most threatening thing you could encounter. You also have to make illogical decisions in order to get to infinite. You skip like 90% of cards you are offered, you make sacrifices for some things that would never make sense in a normal run. And that is just ONE way to play the game on one character, completely ignoring everything that comes with ascension runs. 

And all of that is also completely ignoring everything that isn't purely gameplay. The art is amazing, the soundtrack is amazing, the sound DESIGN is amazing, and there has never been a better time to get into Slay the Spire because there is a sequel that looks like its amping up everything about the first game and giving more of what is undeniably one of the grandpappys of indie roguelikes. That would've been a silly statement 10 years ago, but there are so many indie roguelikes now that it can be hard to stand out among them. 

Slay the Spire has stood the test of time and remains at the top of the tower. Play this game, and if you can, uh, pay for it while you're at it... I did. Eventually.

[code] https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42143664/ [/code] | 仅仅是打了个全成就 ，仍然无法全面的评价这个游戏。因为这100个小时里仅仅专精了猎人，还有三个职业只是简单玩了玩。
真的有点惊叹于游戏的设计，仅仅四个角色，仅仅三个区域（算上心脏四个）却可以让一个游戏有着如此大的可玩性。看似重复的遭遇和地图，随着局内带来的各种惊喜（多种多样的道具，卡组搭配，药水选择，随机事件等）和精妙的设计（数值的平衡和关卡的平衡）可以说再玩几百个小时都不会觉得腻。而且这还是我没去更深体验其他三个角色和增加可玩性的mod时的想法。

If you like deckbuilding, pve strategy and the like, this is just perfect.

Простой игровой процесс с головоломками, которые максимально напрягут ваш мозг. Общение и совместная работа - единственный способ пройти игру.

Эту часть максимальный акцент сделали на описании прямо вот мельчайший деталей. Вы будете ОЧЕНЬ много говорить и скорее всего даже кричать. Не будет ни малейшего понятия, что именно видит другой человек. Таким образом, необходимо быть настолько изобретательным и тщательным в описании вашего окружения, насколько это вообще возможно. Крайне важно найти общий язык с вашим корешом. Иногда правильное действие определяется мельчайшими деталями, поэтому будьте готовы повторять вещи и убедитесь, что ваш тиммейт вас точно хорошо понял. Ну и так же головоломки на время, в которых один из вас может сгореть в какой нибудь лаве или еще куда нибудь упасть.

После того, как прошли игру, можно попробовать поменяться местами, чтобы увидеть, что ваш тиммейт видел раньше, а так же выбить недостающие ачивки. Но самое интересное, что второе прохождение, даже с тем что вы поменяетесь местами, займет до часу+-. Так же существует «секретная» концовка, которую я лично и не понял, потому что по итогу там все так же, как и в обычной. Игра пытается иметь какую то историю, в основном это загадочная, скрытная, потому что каждая часть игры проходит в каком то замке. Просто немного жуткая и не представляет собой ничего большего.

Довольная короткая часть и похожа максимально на предыдущую, только более интересными головоломками, но по времени все так же. Но в любом случае если вам нравятся логические головоломки и есть с кем играть, We Were Here Too это та самая игра и франчиза. Это одна из тех инди-игр, бюджет которой можно определить, просто взглянув на нее. Тем не менее, она убедительно доносит свою идею. Если все равно как то сомневаетесь, есть все так же бесплатная часть, чтобы понять, нравится ли вам подобное. Вдобавок ко всему, We Were Here Too стоит по скидке, как бутылка пива, по этому вижу здесь лишь одни плюсы.

The Gloomhaven game which was released by Flaming Fowl Studios is a decent game; very good graphics for a game of this type, interfaces are a bit clunky, a few things needed tweaking, but overall a 7/10. This negative review is not for them although the game still needed polishing at the time it changed hands.
This negative review is for the peabrains at Embracer Group who somehow managed to dumpster the PC version of the game without actually changing anything. Multiplayer has become effectively unplayable due to the servers dropping players if they lag for more than 0.02 seconds. Despite the existence of a Steam Community Workshop, modding is quite literally unplayable: if you close the game, it will rename your modded campaign's save files to something which game can no longer read. I Googled it and it looks like someone on Github made a plugin which might fix it, but I've honestly had it with this game.
The straw which broke the camel's back was playing >60h of a campaign before realising that the ""enhancements carry over after retiring a character"" setting was switched off; then starting over, playing the new campaign 40h, and then realising that no, the problem is that the setting no longer works. I then found a ""free enhancements"" mod which I was gonna use to replicate the functionality - but hey, guess what! Modded campaigns are also broken.
Anyway, yeah, another broken title - welcome to 2025. Don't waste time or give money to yet another garbage gaming company, just play it on TTS for free. (And please support the Cephalofair game creators, they are amazing.) | Tabletop > this version.

That being said, both are absolute masterpieces in my eyes. If you have ever played the OG game, you will understand. It is such an elaborate board game and I am pleased with the way it translated to online play. 

The game offers solo adventure and group campaigns. This online version is actually more beginner friendly and eases you into it nicely. I really like the lore and the voice acting they have incorporated. You get to pick from a vast array of mercenaries (and unlock more along the way), you get to choose a personal mission to work towards throughout the game and you can customize your player deck and equipment. 

I can appreciate how much work must have gone into making this adaptation and that's why I love it so much. What I don't love are the bugs and glitches that I encounter on a regular basis when I am in the full swing of a campaign with friends. It is easily resolved with a hard reset of the game but it is still annoying. Thank god the game saves every player round >.>

Even with the resets, I have spent over 140 hours in this game and I have enjoyed every moment. No regrets.

I would recommend getting both versions of this game, seriously. Such an amazing dungeon crawling experience <3

P.S. please make Frosthaven x | This has to be the worst way to play Gloomhaven.  I'm bummed out this has been my only experience with the title.  I would recommend instead going and using one of the many, many comprehensive Gloomhaven deployments for Tabletop Simulator instead.  This is a buggy mess, with a terrible interface, and those bugs and glitches will cost you hours of your life. | This game can be brilliant at times, but it's also a constant rollercoaster of frustration.

[h2] 1: Difficulty is Nonsense [/h2]

The difficulty curve of Gloomhaven is literally, by far, the worst I've experienced in any game ever. As you learn the basic rules, you will start out getting absolutely slammed by every scenario even on Easy and everything will feel completely unfair. As you learn to play your cards correctly and your characters unlock perks, cards, gear, and enchantments, you will start to get noticeably more powerful, and will probably bump to Normal or even Hard. And then, just when the ""flow"" state really sets in and you're enjoying the clever tactics and synergy of your party, your characters start retiring. And you don't get a choice about this - if your Personal Quest is complete, that mercenary is deleted.

The ruleset *claims* that this is a victory - you've unlocked a new character! And they will even start with a bonus perk! Unfortunately, without all those levels, items, and perks (not to mention having to learn one or more new characters), the game is suddenly stupidly hard again. You see, even though monsters ""scale"" to your level, they don't scale anywhere near enough. Normal for Party Level 1 (0 gold) and Normal for Party Level 5 (400+ gold in items and enchants) are radically different difficulties, and you will be forced to repeatedly retire and reset back down to sh*tty new characters frequently in your campaign.

[h2] 2: Events Are Total BS [/h2]

Most Road and City events in this game are a binary choice between A and B, and you don't get information on what clicking either button will actually do. Despite this, some of them carry SEVERE negatives like losing 10s of gold, losing checkmarks (3 checkmarks unlock a perk, so losing checkmarks is the worst feeling in the world. imagine if you could lose talent points in WoW just for clicking the wrong dialogue option in a quest), or harsh penalties at the start of your next scenario (remember the difficulty rant above? well what if you randomly started combat with 3 damage and Poison on all your characters too).

And it would be more understandable if events were generally positive, with some risk involved - you'd feel mostly rewarded, with the occasional bad beat. Or if they consistently presented you with clues as to how to approach them. But no - roughly 20% of the time, both A and B choices are negative, and 60% of the time one does nothing / one is negative. And sometimes the designers punish you for being safe, while sometimes they punish you for being bold. There's even several pairs of events with text that is IDENTICAL, except for a single word (e.g. ""red"" vs ""white"") that flips the outcome. Overall, this event system was probably meant to be ""immersive"", but it really just feels crushing and unfun.

[h2] 3: Balance and Gameplay Design [/h2]

For how beloved this game, a lot of the balance and design in it is honestly.... iffy. For example, as you play the campaign, you frequently loot new items - some are even Rare, and are limited to just 1 in your party. And almost all of them are worse than the 10-30g starting items you get in the first 20% of the game. There is never any reason not to vendor 90% of the cool ""loot"" you find and just spend it on enchantments instead.

Classes are in a similar boat - there are very clear S-tier and D-tier choices here, and depending on what you unlock, you may just get stuck in a loop of remaking the same class you just retired.

Enemy ability decks have some wildly OP things in them (e.g. an Initiative 5 card that will go before 99% of characters and make that monster virtually invulnerable for the round), which can make some combat turns feel more like rock-paper-scissors than an interesting tactics game.

On the character side, there is also lots and LOTS of cheese, and the most powerful strategies are all about how much you can cheese and exploit the broken mechanics. Go invisible in every door, find a broken card and Stamina Pot it back 3 times, instakills, mind control, etc. Sometimes the scenarios feel like a satisfying puzzle, or you get use fun synergies and combos. Other times you just find a gimmick and abuse it over and over.

[h2] 4: Digital Problems [/h2]

Gloomhaven was a board game first. The digital game is a huge convenience for automating the monster behaviour and not requiring 30 minutes of fiddling with tokens just to set up a scenario. The digital game is also a clusterf*ck of bad UI and half-finished implementations that will require you to keep a PDF of the rulebook open on your 2nd monitor if you actually want to play the game.

Some especially bad offenders here:
- The game doesn't show you the map or any of the special scenario rules in the screen where you choose cards and battle goals. This is a TACTICS game, meaning your loadout is extremely dependent on the scenario goals and parameters - for example, you may need lots of healing to keep allied NPCs alive, you may need to disarm traps (or push enemies into them), you may need lots of burst AoE damage, or pure single-target. In the board game this is all open information before you start. In the video game, you need to consult an out-of-game PDF or do a clunky Start - Abandon - Back to Map - Travel sequence to redo the whole thing. This is not a one-off, but a *frequent* issue that comes up in almost every scenario.
- Sometimes the combat UI shows you Personal Quests, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it shows you Battle Goals, sometimes it doesn't. It's all over the place.
- Certain UI prompts will lock you out of panning or zooming the camera, so you can't see what's going on in another part of the battlefield.
- Certain UI prompts will lock you out of seeing the items or cards available on your characters.
- A lot of items are quite buggy, and the UI can simply break if you press items or elements in the wrong order.
- The Restart Round button only works on your turn, so if you misclicked something on an enemy's turn, you may have completely f*cked the battle.
- Even after you enter combat, a lot of scenario rules, especially with regards to spawning monsters or upcoming events, are simply not explained at all. In the board game, if a monster spawns at hex F in Round 9, this is open information. If a boss teleports between hexes A-B-C-D, this is open information. In the digital game, it may not tell you why, how, or when things happen at all in a number of scenarios. This is actually where I got so tilted that I decided to write this review - the endgame [spoiler]Dark Rider[/spoiler] boss fight was so poorly explained that I had to spend an hour googling its AI, rules, and strategy.
- The Solo Scenarios DLC also seems like it was rushed and has a number of issues - see the negative reviews on that page.

In summary, Gloomhaven has some brilliant ideas and one of the most clever and fascinating card rulesets of all time. It is also extremely, extremely frustrating to play, and keeps finding new ways to disappoint and infuriate you even 75 hours into your playthrough. | I first played the tabletop version of Gloomhaven and never finished it. Not because I didn't like it, but because it was hard to find time for my group to get together in person. The digital version was our answer! It has some bugs, and there are a few things I wish could be added (house rules for rolling modifiers for example); but it's a great game overall! My friends and I have a great time with this every week! I just hope they make a digital version of Frosthaven...",a game of a different kind.
76561197970698176,537140,Unknown,0.4333333333333333,,0,"This game is a blast!

The concept is a classic boss fight situation, one person uses keyboard and mouse or controller, the other takes the role of the boss using a VR headset!

Very simple and quick fights, but with someone you know controlling the your enemy every round of this game is hilarious fun! At first I thought the fights were unfair for the person not using the headset, however after more time in the game I found it to be surprisingly balanced!

However, I think this game would be MUCH better if there were multiple characters to choose from with different abilities for both the boss and the fighter, and different maps to fight in.

Overall: very fun, silly, and a great game for playing with friends! | I don't usually write reviews.. but this game is freaking awesome fun!
Had a couple of friends over and played for almost 2 hours straight - would have continued if it wasn't 2am!!

The balance is fine..
Yes the boss initially starts out with an easier time.. but once you get the hang of the keyboard (or gamepad) this get ALOT harder.. with the boss player often looking like a crazy person swatting at a horde of flies... 
It even got to the stage where the boss player was lying on the floor to try hide underwater and ""lure"" the hero to his watery lair.. pretty sure we almost had some cracked knees too.. from dropping down so fast to try escape the hero!!

Wins initially started with the boss.. but then pretty much alternated in strings as people adapted to tactics.. (eg. 5 wins boss, 5 wins hero, 5 wins boss etc.)

Definitely the best multiplayer fun we've had on the Vive so far..
To the devs: Things we'd LOVE to see in the future 

- Another map? Especially one where the hero can go around the boss - I think we glitched a couple of times where we could stand on the purple and it was crazy fun

- More skills? For both the boss and hero.. depending on the players.. I can see how balancing might be required.. but it would also allow for more advanced play.. I'm just imagining WOW esk boss fights and it gives me goose bumps..!

- and for a most likely far off wish.. that would tie in well with the last one.. Multiple ""heros""

Get on it guys!! | The game takes a great concept and delivers, definitely a must buy if you have the hardware. The controls on both characters are smooth and precise, I'm using a dualshock 4 as my controller, and the graphics, especially the colors, are great. Balance-wise I think the game is fine. My initial reaction was that the boss was overpowered, but after playing several rounds with my brother, the game became more reliant on who was more tactical and made better predictions. This game is a great example of how local multiplayer can be done with one VR headset. No frame rate or lag issues, I hope the developers update it with new stages and characters, and continue innovate in this new game market. | Kaverini vihjasi tästä pelistä kun tämä oli vielä tekeillä. Nyt kun kuulin, että on tullut steamiin niin pitihän se hommata vaikka vähän hintavalta tuntuikin. Peli itsessään on loistava ja idea hyvä. Sisältöä saisi olla enemmän esimerkiksi useampia bosseja ja heroja sekä mahdollisesti enemmän mappeja.

Joitakin bugejakin vastaan tuli. Boss voi ottaa heti matsin alussa heron käteen, odottaa hetken jotta kupla poistuu ja sitten tiputtaa pois kentältä. Joskus hero pystyy lyömään bossia kun bossi on ottanut heron käteen.

Yksi virhe myös steamin kauppa sivulla. Siellä lukee että olisi MP ja Local MP, mutta en ole ainakaan keksinyt miten MP saisi päälle jotta voisi pelata verkon yli. AI:tä vastaan en ole kokeillut eikä se oikeastaan kiinnostakkaan minua.

1. Parannusehdotuksia olisi, että kahva josta korkeutta pystyy säätämään (hyvä ominaisuus, saatiin lapsillekkin sopiva korkeus), pystyisi myös kääntämään sivuillekkin sekä pakittamaan tai työntämään eteenpäin. Voisi tehdä vaikka kahden kahvan systeemin. Näin ollen mapin pystyisi kääntelemään omalle pelialueelle sopivaksi.

2. Tähän mapin asentoon ja bossin korkeuteen jos pystyisi vielä tekemään pelaaja kohtaisen save preset asetuksen niin pelaajan vaihto lennosta olisi nopeampaa.

3. Vive mikin hyödyntäminen vaikka jollain toisella bossilla tai miksei vaikka jokaisella. Jos puhaltaa niin tönäisee heroa.

4. Boss joka osaisi tehdä monia taikoja oli todella kiva! :)

5. Pelissä voisi olla myös  itemeitä bossille ja herolle. Eli ei hero/boss kohtaisia vaan voisi aina valita vaikka aseen mukaan. Näin saisi tehtyä erillaisia yhdistelmiä.

6. Muutamia kertoja lapseni onnistui sammuttamaan pelin bossina pelatessa. Sopivasti ilmeisesti exit nappi tulee siihen keskelle. Voisiko valikot olla jotenkin vähän vaikka sivussa, että pitäisi vähän kääntyä?

7. Boss voisi heitellä hajonneita kappaleita.

Mielelläni toimisin tarvittaessa vaikka testaajanakin. Lapset suorastaan hinkuvat pelata tätä lisää kokoajan. Nukkumaankaan eivät meenanneet malttaa.

Nykyisellä sisällöllä ja hinnalla sekä mp:n puutteella sanoisin, että ehkä vähän turhan hintava aikuiseen makuun (lisä herot ja bossit voi hyvinkin muuttaa asian), mutta jos taloudesta löytyy lapsiakin niin on kyllä todella hyvä hankinta 9,99e hinnallakin. | Definitey wait for a good sale to get this game on.

It's a ton of fun!  There isn't a lot of replayability though.

The developers aren't supporting this game anymore.",Awesome game!

They introduce a new DLC expansion, but apparently never test it once to see that they have broken half the cards in the game. All of a sudden discount cards no longer provide discounts, the UI just randomly disappears, alerts and messages pop up multiple times. It really is a joke. | As old card bugs are fixed, new bugs are always introduced, repeatedly breaking the gameplay and strategies.
Not visually appealing.
Overly interested in getting your money from DLCs. | The board game is amazing and while this PC version looks good, it is riddled with so many bugs and questionable design decisions that i wonder if the developers are intentionally trying to sabotage the game. The initial game on release was absolutely unplayable with bugged timers, bugged cards, disconnects and more, but after a lengthy time they managed to patch it to a somewhat playable state. But it seems that every time they release new content they break the game, as is the case with the latest patch where a large fraction of the cards don't even work.

76561197970698176,209670,Unknown,0.1166666666666666,,2,"A great game left out in the rain by the developers. You can get the whole game for free and open source since the original creators did put out the code themself. I was really debating on if giving this a positive or negative rating was better, in the end is up to you how you spend money. The workshop is great so I would understand if that was a deciding factor. Personally I have no gripes with the game, only annoying thing they put in it was adverts for Planetoid Pioneers inside it. Planetoid Pioneers being the game that killed people's respect of the developers as it was shortly abandoned too.

Another reason I found it hard to review Cortex Command is trying to fit the gameplay in to a single genre. This has RTS aspects with the economy and battles, but it is also a very chill base builder. It has its economic managment phase, but also the abilily to gather and store wealth during battles for later use. If I was really forced to I would call it something it would be a 2D RTS with a strategy campaing in order to show the results of what you and the AI has made of the planet during corporate warfare. You really need to see it in order to get it.

Any negative review either mentions one of two things. One Data Realms behavior of abounding games and still selling a inferior bug ridden mess (I mean why buy this instead of downloading it for free?). Two the jank of this title. What makes Cortex Command so great is the engine, the terrain and units and vehicles all can be destroyed pixel by pixel. This can ofcourse lead to problems, you could get stuck on your own dead units or a mere pixel in the way. You could be thrown half across the battle field. You could even just die from something you didn't see. Yes there are a lot of crashes. I also  feel the only challange comes from the AI's ability to spam units and have them act on their own, out matches the player's ability to multitask and the rather piss poor auto commands you can give. For one player climbing is a pinch, for another is a unresolvable problem in the code.

The positive aspects is that the code is out there, and I have never seen as impressive mods as I have with this title. You can play with units and vechiles at such a size it boggles the mind. Nothing will preaper you from the joy of seeing all your carnage, wreckages, old fortifcations and corpses remaning battle from battle. I can't count how many times I even destroyed my own units to add flavor to the terrain is just that cool looking (the Star Destroyer being my personal favorite sprite). Some mods just makes this a whole different game, Void Wanderers is so good it could be sold on its own. Is also very natural how you control units and build, I had no problem learning to play on my own and unlike others never experinced any real issues with climbing ladders or interacting with items. No other games really gives me the feel anything I want is possible. | У меня с другом было наиграно сотни часов после учебы ))) С модами было очень весело играть.

76561197970698176,813820,Unknown,2.8,,0,"Like any BR, this one has its issues too. However, if the new DEV team sticks with it, it will continue to grow. It's just a matter of continuing to push updates out and improving the engine (eventually at least to Unreal 4). The fact that people mistake this for Fortnite, constantly, because they would have looked the same in a year long past now, means it's popular enough to even be referenced against. Hitboxes are HUGE. The game allows you to be 'bad' but still be an okay player.

Crossplay is the only way to go right now as if you don't, you may not find a lobby to play in. Peak hours of filled lobbies seem to be between Noon CST till around 7pm. That's way better than how it was where it seemed 'dead' all the time.

IMO there's a LOT that still needs to be done. The former 'pros' still destroy people and if they continue to campy camp newer or just plain NEW players to this game, they'll not want to come back. Only way to really fix that is SBMM or add different modes like specifically ranked for the pros that want to fight others on their level and/or public type lobbies (like many other BR's have). I know that's probably way down the road, but it's going to have to happen to draw the players that can only play a couple hours a night because of their busy lives (aka casuals).

They've put some work into the new skins. New Battle Pass with this last update in November. New class, or rather a class brought back from Alpha. Rumors of another new class down the line. Ultimately people just have to have an interest in this game and there are a few creators that play this game that are IN FACT promoting the crap out of it.

It started off at an interesting pace, but the way you are blindsided by enemy mechanics later in the campaign becomes more frustrating than interesting because it feels like you've been tricked into playing incorrectly. For example, some enemies have tremendous amounts of armor, but they don't show up until a certain point. So enemies will go from having low amounts like 5-10 armor, then suddenly they have 40-60. If you don't have hard hitting weapons, or armor shredding capabilities, this one enemy will bring your entire team to a standstill. Additionally, there is an enemy that can call for reinforcements every turn, and said enemy constantly flees from your soldiers. This drags out encounters and forces you to have to rush to that specific enemy to take it out. This is compounded by the fact that your soldiers only carry so much ammo into battle, so if you didn't bring 2 spare magazines per soldier, it's possible this one enemy is able to summon enough reinforcements to run your entire team dry. I understand the nature of the game is that you cannot win every encounter or solve every problem, but it feels like that should be a choice and not just a ""gotcha"" mechanic that is sprung on me at some point. 

I really enjoyed the aiming mechanics, and I think it's a great idea instead of just having a % chance to hit like many other similar games. I think Willpower as an ability resource is also a fun way to handle skills instead of giving them cooldowns. But, unfortunately, the negatives just weight this game down too much for it to be enjoyable. | This game is so close to being good, but instead, it just winds up being frustrating. There's SO SO MANY good ideas here, but the game falls apart in the balancing and structure of engagements. Every encounter has the same enemies with a substitute here and there, but after a certain point in the game, it always has this one enemy that you HAVE to kill as soon as possible because it calls in reinforcements every turn for a fourth of its action economy, it also reanimates fallen allies in an aoe for a fourth of its action economy, and several devastating debuffs it throws out as large aoe's around itself. The really fun part? It has the most HP you can find on an enemy that you see outside of nests (so far). That's not even mentioning that it can spawn on the other side of the map from you, at least 2 turns away before you can even see it, and that's assuming there's just the one because half the time, there are 2 of them. That's one part of a larger problem but I promise it is a prominent one. 

From a story perspective, things are just weird; all of the factions hate each other, including the ""Moderate"" faction, just to a lesser degree. Despite it being in their best interests, you lose favour with them whenever you protect a haven that isn't theirs. To be clear, not instead of, but including. I've yet to fail in responding to a haven under siege from any factions. On the other hand, my diplomatic relations aren't harmed when I attack a faction as part of a prerequisite diplomacy mission.

I guess my overall point is that while it feels like this game should be great, it lacks the polish and balance to be what I'd consider ""good."" | Turn based strategy game.  Multiple paths to victory (and defeat). Fun DLC.  Really enjoying this one. | Since the most recent reviews of this game seem to be mixed I feel compelled to write this review after 4 year.
I love this game! I am a huge fan of turn based combat games like XCOM and this one was exactly the right fit for me. The targeting system is nice, the fact that you can build multiple bases, aircrafts and squads in order so parallelize your operations is a huuuuge upside for people like me who are really annoyed if a mission is not reachable, because it is on the other side of the planet. It just feels more like an expanding global operation instead of a single ship that can only be at one spot at a time (hey, I also love XCOM2, but this really hooked me in Phoenix Point).
The multiclassing-system is great, since the class synergies are insane, if you know what you are doing. You can build soldiers that can wipe out the entire enemy force in turn 1 solo under generous conditions. Many people seem to complain about the pacing, but in my experience it is just fast enough to keep things interesting. The one enemy type that I really hated in my first 2 runs were the two Umbra-Types (previously only one), but since they where made more visible und actually distinguishable from the virus-condition you can at least prepare for them.
However, I must admit, the Festering Skies DLC was not for me and I deactivate it for most runs...
I can strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes this type of turn based strategy game. | It scratches the XCOM-2 itch without quite being XCOM-2. There are a few quality improvements over XCOM, such as the ability to target specific enemy body parts to disable them, which opens up tactical opportunities missing in XCOM2. There is some fun enemy variety, and the evolution dynamic is pretty neat. The campaign as a whole feels more meaningful as well, with the ability to manage multiple ships with select teams of personnel. 

The class system, however, is pretty opaque and not nearly as fun as that of XCOM-2. There isn't as much room to really optimize a certain person for a certain playstyle in my opinion, which took a lot of the fun out of the game for me. 

If you've played XCOM-2 to death and need something similar, this is good. If you haven't played XCOM-2; well,  that's the king of the genre for a reason; play that first.","It's a good game, but the game isn't very good."

Controls and how the character responds to my inputs suck. Sometimes he can't start running on the first try or does it with a delay if he's close to an interactive object. Why? I don't know.
During battles, it literally kills me (but just in the game). The target-assist system always sucks, but if you get punished for targeting the wrong enemy, it makes you suffer because you might not even do it, but you still get punished just because that's how the game works.

Quake Champions — это яркий и динамичный шутер, который возвращает нас к корням классических многопользовательских боевых игр. С привычной для серии невероятной скоростью, арсеналом мощного оружия и уникальными персонажами, игра идеально подходит для поклонников старой школы, но с современными улучшениями. Вся суть в том, чтобы постоянно быть на шаг впереди противника, и Quake Champions прекрасно передает этот дух.

Уникальные чемпионы с особыми способностями. В отличие от классических частей игры, здесь каждый чемпион имеет свои способности, что придает игре глубину и тактический элемент.
Простота управления, но глубокая механика. Несмотря на достаточно простое управление, достижение мастерства требует времени, так как тут важно каждое движение, и каждый выстрел может стать решающим.
Невероятная скорость. Здесь все очень быстро — от передвижений до сражений. Для тех, кто любит сумасшедшую скорость и беспрерывный экшен, это прямо в точку.

✅ Скорость и динамика. Никакой задержки — ты постоянно в движении, а каждый бой заставляет ощущать настоящий экшен.
✅ Интересные чемпионы с уникальными способностями. Каждый чемпион добавляет свой стиль в игру, что позволяет найти своего фаворита и адаптировать стратегию.
✅ Простота, но сложность в мастерстве. Легко начать, но достичь высот мастерства можно только с опытом и тренировками.
✅ Классная аркадная атмосфера. Возвращение к классическому геймплею Quake — смешивание ностальгии с современными элементами.

❌ Невозможно играть на низких настройках без потери качества. При плохой оптимизации на слабых ПК могут возникнуть проблемы с фреймрейтом.
❌ Микротранзакции. Хоть они и не влияют на геймплей, но влияют на внешний вид персонажей, что может раздражать игроков, не желающих тратить деньги.
❌ Некоторые карты могут быть перегружены. Некоторые уровни могут показаться чересчур запутанными, что иногда затрудняет ориентацию в бою.

[h2] Вердикт: 8 из 10 рокетных лаунчей | It's a fun game with a lot of stuff from older Quake games.

This game has all the movement types of the previous Quake Games. Bunny hopping from Quake, strafe jumping from Quake 2 and Quake 3 and crouch sliding from Quake 4.

It has most of the old weapons except the Grenade Launcher and instead got the Tribolt.

The big difference between this Quake and previous Quakes is that you have Champions.

There are 16 champions, and they all have one passive and one active ability. The passive abilities could be different movement other than strafe jumping (two have bunny hopping, two have crouch sliding, everyone has strafe jumping) to regenerating some health, get extra armor at kills, having double jump and many other things.Active abilities is what you activate when you need it, like fire strike, rage and plasma trail, to mention a few.

I recommend checking out the learning section in the game, or the [url=https://quakechampions.fandom.com/wiki/Quake_Champions_Wiki]Quake Champions Wiki[/url] to read things outside of the game.


It's not a game for sneaking really, that won't win many matches, an no matches outside of duels. It's about map knowledge, reading your opponent, strategy, aim and movement, not about trying to spot your enemy (which is why you have a colored outline of your opponents and team mates to easily differentiate between them).

If you're new to the game, you will have a very hard time vs. ""everybody"" else, cause most have played Quake games for many years, so even barely average players seem like they are very good at the game when you face them, which makes for a very steep learning curve, and there isn't really any training courses or anything like that.

[quote=Fatal1ty]Practice, practice, practice[/quote]

I recommend checking [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95spyl1LRTc]rapha's movement guide[/url] to get an insight into movement.

It has some issues, and not a lot of funding, and the battle passes are full of the same things except for 1-3 new weapon models each time. Hopefully the next Quake, if there is one, will take a different course and have more not so intense, or hardcore, modes to keep players playing, something more chill, while also having the ""hardcore"" standard Quake modes as well for those that want the old Quake type of gameplay.

I recommend it cause if you do take the time to learn the game, you can have a lot of fun with gameplay there isn't much of anymore.

+ Non-Linear Gameplay: One of the game’s standout features is its emphasis on player choice. Whether you prefer direct confrontation or sneaking past threats, Prey allows you to adapt your play style to the situation

+ Variety in Gameplay Mechanics: From combat and stealth to puzzle-solving and resource management, Prey offers a mix of gameplay elements that keep the experience fresh throughout

+ Immersive Sim Elements: The ability to interact with the environment in multiple ways—using tools, crafting upgrades, or finding alternative paths—adds depth to the gameplay and encourages creative problem-solving

Cons

- Pacing Issues: Despite its engaging setup, some parts of the game can feel unnecessarily slow

- Repetitive Encounters: While the Typhon enemies are designed to be both terrifying and challenging, some encounters can feel repetitive, potentially reducing the tension over time

- Balance Concerns: At times, certain weapons or abilities may feel overpowered, whereas others seem less useful. This occasional imbalance can affect the overall

- Enemy Difficulty: In some instances, the enemy AI proves to be unforgiving

76561197970698176,741820,Prey: Typhon Hunter,0.0,Action,0,"Prey: Typhon Hunter : By Triple F

""Prey: Typhon Hunter"" is an ambitious multiplayer expansion to Prey (2017), developed by Arkane Studios and published by Bethesda. Released in December 2018 as part of the Mooncrash DLC, it takes the immersive sim mechanics of the base game and transforms them into an asymmetrical multiplayer experience. At its core, ""Typhon Hunter"" is a game of cat and mouse, where one player takes on the role of Morgan Yu, the protagonist from Prey, while up to five others control shapeshifting alien Mimics. The concept is intriguing, drawing clear inspiration from games like Prop Hunt, but with Prey’s signature sci-fi horror elements woven in. Unfortunately, while the idea is strong, execution issues and a lack of long-term support prevented it from reaching its full potential.

The gameplay is simple but tense. The Morgan player must hunt down all Mimics within a time limit, while the Mimic players disguise themselves as everyday objects scattered throughout the environment. The catch is that the Mimics can move, attack, and switch disguises at will, leading to unpredictable and often hilarious encounters. This creates an atmosphere of paranoia for Morgan, as every chair, cup, or trash can could be an enemy waiting to pounce. The Mimics, on the other hand, must balance deception with aggression, knowing that staying hidden for too long can make them easy targets. This dynamic makes for thrilling matches, especially when both sides are evenly skilled. However, over time, the novelty begins to wear off due to limited maps, repetitive strategies, and a lack of meaningful progression systems.

One of ""Typhon Hunter’s"" strongest aspects is its adherence to Prey’s immersive and atmospheric design. The environments pulled from the main game are richly detailed, and the sound design plays a crucial role in heightening tension. Morgan's footsteps echo ominously in empty hallways, while Mimics scurry and chitter as they reposition. The visual cues and environmental storytelling, hallmarks of Prey’s level design, add depth to the experience, making every match feel like a mini horror story. However, the mode struggles with balance; skilled Morgan players can often make quick work of the Mimics, while coordinated Mimics can sometimes overwhelm Morgan too easily. These imbalances, combined with a relatively small player base, made finding consistently engaging matches difficult.

In addition to the multiplayer mode, ""Typhon Hunter"" also includes an experimental VR escape room experience called TranStar VR. This mode offers a handful of single-player puzzle-based challenges set within Prey’s universe. While a neat concept, TranStar VR feels more like a tech demo than a fully fleshed-out experience. The puzzles are decent, but the movement and interaction mechanics can feel clunky, especially compared to other VR puzzle games. It’s an interesting addition but not compelling enough to justify a purchase on its own.

The biggest issue with ""Typhon Hunter"" is its longevity or lack thereof. Unlike other successful asymmetrical multiplayer games, such as Dead by Daylight or Among Us, it lacks the content updates, unlockable rewards, or deep customization options that keep players engaged over the long term. With only a handful of maps and no significant updates after launch, the player base dwindled quickly. By mid-2019, finding a match without coordinating with friends became increasingly difficult. This lack of long-term support significantly hurt what could have been a thriving multiplayer experience.

Despite its flaws, ""Prey: Typhon Hunter"" is an interesting experiment that offers some genuinely fun and tense moments, especially for fans of Prey’s world and lore. The core gameplay mechanics work well, and the blend of horror and deception makes for a uniquely stressful multiplayer experience. However, its lack of content, balance issues, and dwindling player base prevented it from ever truly standing out in the competitive multiplayer scene.

Ultimately, ""Typhon Hunter"" is best seen as a novelty rather than a must-play multiplayer game. If you’re a die-hard Prey fan or enjoy asymmetrical multiplayer games, it’s worth trying, just don’t expect a game with lasting appeal. While it had the potential to be a cult hit, the lack of post-launch support meant it faded into obscurity all too quickly.","""Prey: Typhon Hunter"" is an ambitious multiplayer expansion to Prey (2017), developed by Arkane Studios and published by Bethesda.

Its alright, theres just better out there including  in the franchise | Years of XCOM franchise and worldbuilding gone to waste through typical American hero action movie vibes and limited gameplay.

It's nothing horrible, it's just bland. 

If you really like XCOM gameplay, it's a fun mix of gameplay. If you're here for an interesting story, than this isn't gonna do it. It's not as hard as the other XCOMs, but that doesn't mean it's easy. | bleh. This game is like ""We have XCOM 2 at home"" walmart off-brand version. Just a massive letdown compared to both it's predecessors. I know people say that this game isn't a true successor to XCOM 2 and that's it's apples to oranges, but these apples are spoiled with worms in them. I can't recommend it | I do like the game but its very very unfair at times to the point i just wanna turn off the game.
Especially in missions where you have to ""stop enemies from destroying evidence"" or ""walking trough the exit"".
You enter a room where the exit/evidence is at the very end. Then the enemies are positioned right next to the exit/evidence, and there are like 6 or 7 of them. if one enemy stands next to the exit/evidence when the turn ends... you lose. it just baffles me since there are sometimes six enemies there that will blast your ass if you leave cover, and if you have an enemy that takes 4-5 shots to kill and exactly this enemy stands by the exit/evidence, well.... good luck killing him from the very other side of the room in one turn..

EDIT: Also, the writing is kind of weak. For this kind of game, you don't have to create an over-the-top story, but the interactions between the characters are 80% about food. ""Oh, you want to try my red curry? No, thank you. Red curry is not good for me. I’d rather take a NOTdog... You mean a HOTdog, right? No! A NOTdog, lol... Okay, I’ll take 3 NOTdogs, please...""  

The ""stunned"" status is a mistey in itself. If you stun someone for TWO rounds, he will be stunned for ONE round.
If you stunn someone for ONE round (especially if you want this enemy to skip his turn) he gets stunned for ZERO rounds!!! you ""stun"" him and he straight away makes his turn....


I don’t want to be that guy, but it really sounds like people with blue hair made the script. It feels exactly like something from the new SAINTS ROW...","I try to kill them, they are positioned right next to the exit/evidence."

O jogo é complicado do início ao fim, porém a imersão é muito boa, possui um plot interessante, personagens bem escritos que participam ativamente da sua jornada. É um jogo tático baseado em RPG de mesa e sua progressão é toda feita em escolhas e rolagens de dados, e sobre as escolhas, são bem impactantes e possuam consequências reais no desenrolar da história. Elas são baseadas no sistema clássico de tendências em RPG, ou seja, além de você poder ser bom, mau ou neutro, existem escolhas mais específicas como Lawful Good, Chaotic Good, Lawful Evil, etc. quanto mais escolhas boas ou ruins você faz, isso desbloqueia diálogos com interações diferentes.

Logo de início o jogo já te pede pra criar seu personagem em uma ficha enorme de algumas páginas com muita coisa pra escolher, da pra ficar perdido ali. São dezenas de classes, as possibilidades de builds são imensas, da pra misturar classes, tem centenas de habilidades, magias e efeitos diferentes. Infinidade de itens e armas e tudo mais que se espera em um RPG deste tipo.

O combate é tempo real com pausas, porém da pra colocar em turnos e jogar de forma praticamente idêntica a jogos como Baldur's Gate 3. Sendo bem sincero o modo em tempo real é ruim, as batalhas viram uma bagunça, você precisa pausar o tempo todo senão fica difícil coordenar os personagens e aí vai tomar infinitos debuffs roubadíssimos e vai morrer sem ver nada, por isso recomendo jogar em turno mesmo. Ao longo do game existem encontros aleatórios no mapa, contra bandidos e inimigos mais fracos e repetidos, neste caso é tranquilo de fazer em tempo real pois normalmente são batalhas bem mais fáceis e rápidas.

Pathfinder Kingmaker é um jogo indie e o primeiro do estúdio, então muita coisa é mais limitada, mas algumas delas me incomodaram bastante, como por exemplo a câmera que não gira, a navegação do jogo é através de um mapa onde você escolhe um destino e entra na área, por conta disso exploração é muito fraca, estas áreas normalmente são bem pequenas. A iluminação do jogo é muito ruim, o seu personagem emana uma luz ao redor dele e todo o resto é escuro, é uma fog que é presente até durante o dia, me incomodou bastante.

Dentro do jogo tem um minigame de gerenciamento de reinos, onde você simula a evolução do seu reino, afinal um dos plots do jogo é você evoluir desde um mercenário até virar um Barão e se tornar Rei daquela região. Você cria e evolui sua cidade, conquista territórios, coloca seus companions para serem seus conselheiros e ministros e delega missões a eles, é basicamente um simulador de cidade medieval. É um sistema legal, em diversos momentos viciei legal em ficar gerenciando as cidades. Porém o time-lapse disto acelera o jogo e te força a executar algumas missões e te coloca tempo pra resolver, isso também é um pouco frustrante..

Pra finalizar, a otimização do jogo também deixa a desejar, alguns mapas tem quedas de frames, e por ser um jogo que não tão recente deveria rodar bem melhor, mas não chega a atrapalhar a experiência. 

É um game extremamente complexo, mas pra quem busca uma aventura que simule a experiência de se jogar um RPG de mesa tá aí uma opção bem fiel. | I wish this game wasn't impossible to play with non-perfect builds on normal mode.

补充：实际上直接找到游戏文件夹（STEAM-库-Prismata-右键-属性-游戏文件夹，把steam彻底关闭退出后台，直接运行游戏，不会调用steam，不计时...... | As someone who can only play StarCraft 2 with ~50APM and failed to defend fast pool everytime, I really love Prismata. A very complex and interesting turn based strategy game. Even as a professional mathematician, I find puzzles and matches in this game deep, hard and very exciting. Different from most of the modern card/turn based strategy games, this game has almost no RNG (except the coinflip in the beginning of each match, and randomized advanced units, which are the same for both side), and all information is open to both side, so calculation and prediction play very very important role here.

The learning curve is somehow steep. More or less like a good RTS game, there are things to memorize: common openings, tricks and trades... But luckliy, there are very good articles about these aspects already: google Prismata library. Once you get over the basics, every game becomes very exciting and unique.

That said, this game is not for everyone. It is for those people who like rigorous strategy and calculation, and hate the gamble effect RNG brings. A very unique game, also well polished. And somehow to my surprise, the in game chat and the community is very friendly, helpful and very warmful towards new players. 

 | This game is the absolute pinnacle of turn-based strategy. It is really a surprise I only heard about this game now, a few days after the release on steam, even though the game has existed for over 3 years I heard. And why you definitely SHOULD buy this game? Here are a few examples of my reasons behind my decision to get Prismata:
- I like chess, I've played HS, Gwent, Duel of Champions, Fire Emblem and loads of other different turn based strategy games, but I have never come across anything like Prismata before. The combination of no RNG(apart from coinflip, which has around the same effect as chess) and very complex game mechanics which need to be perfectly executed or you literally can lose instantly, really creates a very competetive and interesting game environment, where you always feel you can improve gameplaywise after any given game.
- Prismata has been made super-indie, by only a couple of people and because of that has a completely different mindset compared to for example Duel of Champions, which is another game I also loved, although it was shut down by Ubisoft. The developers have clearly emphazised how much it means for them to create a no-p2w environment where you don't have to grind for the cards, or anything, although this is not a card game but a resource management game. Completely opposed to for example the ""pay until you are broke"" - method which sounds like to be the monetization option for Valve's newest ""strategy"" game Artifact and many other similar games in 1v1 strategy genre in general.
- The developers have come up with a really clever solution to prevent the game from every getting solved, or repetitive, as the available ""card"" pool for both players is partly randomized every game. And yes for both players means both players have the same options, in every game, negating most balance issues with cards being overpowered or too weak, as you cannot choose what to take with you ingame.
- The lack of deckbuilding was a weird thought for me at first, but it actually is the perfect solution for any game like this. The reason why card games or other strategy games which involve deck building of some kind get tiresome rather quickly, unless new cards are added very often, which has its own issues with balancing and older cards getting useless and price for new players etc. Although I repeat, this is NOT a card game even though it maybe might seem like one when you take a first look at the UI, I feel that comparisons to popular card games work well with this game, as the strategy is in the end somewhat similar, just without the surprise factor of your opponent having a hand you cannot see. When the options are open to inspection for both players, the mindgames really kick in. And as every game is different and you have to figure out a new strategy for every given game, and also look out for what your opponent is doing, the game will never feel stale!
- Since steam release although the success isn't like HS level, I have had no trouble finding opponents when queueing. Also the AI is really challenging and the single player missions are already so difficult that it feels like they have a lot more content than they  actually do, funnily enough. I like the art style of the game even though I have seen many people calling it ""cheap"" or ""mobile like"", but tbh I think for such a small development team the art style is more than good enough, and main plus I'd say every unit at least feels unique and distinct, thanks to the artwork.
- Main positive is the mechanics though, but explaining all those in a single review might take a little too long, but I just say that after turn one, literally anything is possible. The units have cool combos and setting up situations where you will end up ahead in the long run is crucial to winning any game, and the key is WHEN to do things or not.

Negatives:
-Price of the game can feel a bit high (around 21€ for me with the first DLC) but it did feel worth it for me after I played a while. The game will likely be free to play some point but I wouldn't wait for it as the founder edition has some cool bonuses, like letting you unlock the various skins and other cosmetics for the units a lot easier. Talk about supporting a great game!
- The skill ceiling is REALLY HIGH, like yeah this game is not for everyone, it can feel overwhelming without any experience about these kind of strategy games, and it will take a while even for more experienced puzzle solvers like me to get the hang of it. But if you feel like you are up for a challenge, you will get it.
- If you require GWENT level of art, then maybe this game is not for you. | 卡在界面进不去，开加速也不行，希望官方能提供一个解决办法，不止我一个人遇到了。游戏先好评支持了。 | Summary:  Prismata is turn-based Starcraft meets Magic: the Gathering.  It's recommended if you like the resource management and build optimization of Starcraft, but find unit micromanagement frustrating.  Also recommended if you like the tactical gameplay of Magic: the Gathering, but dislike the cost of collecting cards and dislike games being determined by which player draws the right cards.

Pros: 
- Deep and unique strategic gameplay
- All players on an even playing field
- Every game plays out differently
- Excellent, non-cheating AI with a broad range of difficulties
- Rich support for competitive play
- Very affordable

Cons:
- Small, hardcore playerbase
- Sometimes makes me feel dumb
- Skins only obtainable through a microtransaction slot machine

Prismata is one of those rare genre-innovator games for which it is difficult to make direct comparisions to other games, but which is, in retrospect, surprising that something similar hasn't been done before.  The best summary is ""Starcraft, the card game.""

Over the course of a match, you and your opponent will take turns building units by spending resources in exchange for playing cards to form a tableu of units, selecting some units to attack your opponent, and managing your defenses.  However, instead of playing units from a hand of cards, they are built from a card pool which allows all units to be built at any time, provided you have the required resources available.  This unit pool of fifteen to twenty-two units is randomly generated at the start of each match from a library of more than one hundred options, changing the optimal strategy each game, and rewarding the player more able to adapt their own strategy to the available choices.

The units themselves are purchased using five different categories of resources.  At the start of a match, you start with two engineers, which produce energy, and a handful of drones, which produce gold.  (The first player gets six drones, and the second player gets seven.)  You can use energy to produce more drones, and use gold to purchase other units and structures.  These structures produce additional red, green and blue resources, which are further required to buy more advanced units.

Some units are purely economic, others can attack your opponent, others defend against attacks, and some can do both.  Many of the more expensive units have an ability which you can choose to activate once a turn, perhaps spending some resources, perhaps making that unit unavailable to defend, in exchange for some positive effect.  The five categories of resources, the wide variety of units with unique effects, and the attacking and defending phases bring to mind Magic: the Gathering as a gameplay comparison.  However, unlike Magic, the same units are available to both players during the game, and unlike Magic, there is no need to buy card packs in order to get access to units.

Because the only randomness during the match is the selection of units available, and because the same units are available to both players, the winner of a match is determined only by he who makes the best decisions.  This can be very rewarding when you win, but when you lose, there isn't anything to blame but your own poor performance.  This isn't Hearthstone, where you can shift the blame to the random number generator.  This isn't League of Legends, where you can scapegoat your teammates.

The high learning curve of Prismata and lack of random elements means that acquiring the skills required to succeed against other players can be a frustrating experience.  This is particularly the case because the player population is somewhat small, with less than two hundred players online at any given time, and quite hardcore.  If you are the sort of player that is easily frustrated by losing, this may not the game for you.  However, if you respond to a losing streak by trying to analyze your mistakes and attempt to ""git gud"", to put it in the parlance of our subculture, then Prismata will be a rewarding.

The game does provide the tools for improving your performance.  There is a replay system allow you to review your mistakes and do ""what-if"" scenarios to see if different decisions would have led to better results.  You can also spectate top-level players in-game, making the game itself a rich environment to learn from the best.

Mitigating the initially brutal multiplayer experience is a lengthy set of single-player battle training missions.  These missions walk you through available tactics and strategies for effective Prismata play.  You can expect to spend twenty hours or more progressing through the single player content.  Also available is a very capable AI opponent, with many difficulty settings, which should allow anyone to find the right level of challenge.  

Currently, Prismata is available through Steam for $25 USD, and the value for dollar at that price point is very generous.  However, be aware that Prismata will, in the future, be a free-to-play game with microtransactions.  The full gameplay experience will be available for free.  Whales will be on even footing with the completely free-to-play player.

However, skins for your units are acquired through a microtransaction slot machine which seems optimally designed to bilk the potential problem gambler.  A trifecta of exploitation makes this so:  difficult to estimate probabilities, cognitive biases about loss aversion, and an in-game currency creating psychological distance from real-world dollar value.  Of course, these skins are cosmetic only, providing no in-game advantage, so you are free to ignore them entirely.  But the process of acquiring skins does feel a little slimey.  I'd strongly prefer directly spending money on skins, instead.

If you are interested in Prismata, I would recommend buying in at the asking price on Steam, since it does give you extra single player content, but if you are unwilling to pay the asking price and can't wait for the free-to-play roll out, be aware that sometimes streamers on Twitch have keys to give to new players, and apparently there is a Discord where you can ask for a key and get one.  I've also seen the developer give keys to people asking about the game on the Prismata subreddit.",gotten a chance to play chess.

It can absolutely be a casual game if you want it to be, but if you want to maximize your score then this game is actually quite deep.

You place buildings, they get points based on their proximity to other buildings, and you need to score points to unlock the next pack of semi-random buildings. That's it, that's the game. What this does is create a game where you're trying to balance placing buildings in the highest scoring way with your need to score points right now, so that you may unlock the buildings you need to make the highest scoring plays. When you can place anything anywhere, this creates quite a complex puzzle.

[/h2]
[h3] Personal experience: [/h3]
I spent over 5 hours in the game, and I can confidently say that it’s perfect for those looking to unwind and relax. The simplicity and minimalism of the game are top-notch. At first, I was surprised by how such a simple mechanic could be so captivating. Slowly, I started building islands, exploring their potential, and genuinely enjoying the process.
The game is a perfect way to relax. There’s no pressure; you simply build, develop, and enjoy the view. I found the way ecosystems come to life and how the island transforms into a vibrant world incredibly satisfying.

[b] Pros: [/b]
[list]
[*] Minimalist style: The visuals are light and pleasant, not overwhelming, yet still visually appealing.
[*] Easy to learn: The gameplay is simple to grasp, but it’s addictive and hard to stop playing.
[*] Calming and atmospheric: Perfect for those who want to relax and disconnect from the world.
[*] Building process: Watching your island grow and develop is a deeply immersive experience.
[/list]
[b] Cons: [/b]
[list]
[*] Limited content: The game can feel a bit repetitive over time, and while it leaves a good impression, you may crave more variety in mechanics.
[*] Lack of challenge: For those who prefer dynamic gameplay, the game might feel too laid-back and lacking in competitive elements.
[*] Short experience: Some players might find the game to be a bit too short and simple after a few hours.

ISLANDERS is an excellent game for those who appreciate a relaxing experience and want a break from intense projects.

[b] My rating: 8/10 [/b]
[i] I recommend it to anyone who’s looking for a peaceful, laid-back experience without expecting complex mechanics. [/i] | [u][b]ISLANDERS[/b][/u] is a serene and tranquil procedurally-generated, endless, score-based puzzle game which has a city-building theme to it. Although its tagline states that it is ""A minimalist city builder,"" this is slightly misleading because the city-building aspect is moreso an aesthetic rather than a core identity of the gameplay since it doesn't involve resource or population management like the more traditional city-building games and is also less predictable due to the randomness of the maps and some of the building layouts.

Overall, I recommend the game as it is very relaxing to play casually for an hour or two here and there, while simultaneously having just enough depth to satiate score-chasers, and the procedural generation of the maps constantly challenges you to adapt to the random terrain and natural features that you are provided. Although I don't care to compete for high scores, I found that attempting to optimize my cities was unexpectedly fun and especially gratifying after planning the general layout of my city and watching the points come flooding in as my plan came to fruition.

Note: this review is current as of the unnumbered patch released on 23 November 2023 which is the latest update.

- The gameplay is very accessible to a wide range of players as it is simple and intuitive enough for casual players, yet also has enough depth to challenge score-chasers, but the game is very minimalistic and offers little to no precision when it comes to building an efficient and aesthetically-pleasing city;
- The replay value is decent and the game is fun when played occasionally in shorter sessions but the core gameplay loop will get repetitive very quickly;
- The graphics are vibrant, almost cartoonish, and are reminiscent of the ""Chibi"" art style;
- The soundtrack is composed of relaxing ambient music with rural-style sound effects to give the feeling of an authentic city; and
- There is no story whatsoever but a casual puzzle game like this doesn't have a need for one.

The game has 38 achievements, most of which will be acquired throughout casual gameplay while a few will require you to go out of your way to set them up but aren't difficult by any means and should take less than 10 hours to achieve; however, the [i]Conqueror[/i] achievement will take at least 30 hours by itself and require you to become very familiar with the mechanics of the game while also planning the general layout of each map before placing any buildings. That being said, it isn't nearly as RNG-dependent as many complaints on the Steam Discussion forums would lead you to believe as you merely have to invest some time into the game to learn it beyond a casual level since the achievement is not a given whatsoever.

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
The gameplay is more akin to a puzzle game rather than a traditional city builder because of its focus on simplicity and minimalism: a map is procedurally-generated, you are given a choice between two random sets of buildings, and your inventory is populated with a number of buildings from the chosen set. Your goal is to place the buildings efficiently in order to receive point bonuses from other types of buildings and meet the point threshold which gives you another choice between two more random sets of buildings. This process repeats itself until you either fail to meet the point threshold, by having no more buildings to place, or meet the threshold which allows you to travel to the next map and restart the gameplay loop, ad infinitum.

As far as casual play is concerned, the game is simple and intuitive enough to get into and occasionally have fun with in small spurts. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for those who like to chase high scores because the game demands absolute precision when placing buildings and planning out your city but offers you very few tools to facilitate this need and the tools that do exist are quite shoddy. For example, there is somewhat of an integrated ""snap-to"" ability but it is finnicky and rarely lines up buildings perfectly with one another which can lead to inefficiencies and cause you to lose points -- and sometimes those few points could be the difference between losing a run altogether or proceeding to the next map.

Sometime between 2019 and 2022, the game was handed over to an entirely new development team and they added the more difficult achievements which require a certain level of precision that the game simply can't offer and this makes the minimalist approach of the game feel almost incongruous with, and somewhat inadequate for, these new achievements (one of which is the infamous [i]Conqueror[/i] achievement). If they had made the existing snapping more accurate, added an option to turn on a grid, or gave you a laser level tool, then the game would be feel much more precise but you can definitely tell the difference between the two development teams' philosophy on achievements.

Another minor gripe that I have with the overly-minimalist approach is that the House, Mansion, and Park buildings also have a variety of different layouts (similar to Tetris blocks) but the next one is randomly chosen for you and can't be changed which is irritating from an efficiency perspective and true city-building aspect but I can't complain too much about it because it fits the minimalist design approach that they were going for.

Nevertheless, I still found it quite fun to learn the more intricate nuances to the game's mechanics and optimize my cities; however, once I figured out the most efficient setup then the most fun part became the planning of the city and playing the actual game for long periods of time became a bit of a chore which is why I think that it's a good game to occasionally have fun with in smaller doses because it gets repetitive very quickly.

The game also has a Sandbox Mode where you can unleash your creative side  with an unlimited supply of all buildings and a Photo Mode where you can take fancy images of said creations using a variety of built-in filters and tools.

[h3]Graphics[/h3]
The graphics are vibrant and almost cartoonish in nature which gives it a very charming look. The buildings are also blocky but in a cute and bubbly sort of way -- if anything, I'd say that its art style actually resembles the popular ""Chibi"" art style because of how cute, minimalistic, and caricature-like the art design is. The second development team also added a number of optional seasonal and holiday themes that you can apply to your game to spruce things up at your whim which is a nice touch.

[h3]Sound[/h3]
The soundtrack is made up of relaxing ambient music with scenic noises such as dogs barking, birds chirping, and other rural sound effects. The music is so modest that I'm not even sure if the audio tracks would count as ""songs"". Much like the graphics, there are a number of optional seasonal and holiday-themed songs that you can enable or disable but I frankly couldn't even tell the difference between any of the songs. All-in-all, it's just a very relaxing soundtrack which I would say resembles white noise to some degree. The sound effects are few and far between but the main one you will hear is placing a building which makes a very satisfying plopping sound.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]
Overall, I recommend the game because you can easily relax to it for an hour and forget about the stressors of life as you get immersed in its soothing audio, charming visuals, and straightforward and leisurely nature. If you're more of a score-chaser then it's surprisingly fun and engaging to plan out your city, optimize the placement of your buildings, and get that feeling of elation as your plan flourishes and you watch your points soar. | ISLANDERS is a beautifully minimalist city-building game that’s perfect for relaxing and flexing your creativity. The simple mechanics focus on strategic placement of buildings, offering a satisfying mix of puzzle and strategy elements. The colorful, procedurally generated islands are gorgeous, and each new map feels like a fresh canvas for your ideas.

While the game doesn’t offer endless depth or complexity, its simplicity is part of its charm. It’s great for short sessions or unwinding after a long day. For its price, it’s an excellent indie gem and a must-play for fans of chill city builders. | Маленькая, но приятная и медитативная. Функционал не большой. Тем не менее хочется возвращаться и играть вновь и вновь!","The game is a perfect way to relax and unwind. The simplicity and minimalism of the game are top-notch. At first, I was surprised by how such a simple mechanic could be so captivating. Slowly, I started building islands, exploring their potential, and genuinely enjoying the process. The game is a perfect way to relax. There’s no pressure; you simply build, develop, and enjoy the view. I found the way ecosystems come to life and how the island transforms into a vibrant world incredibly satisfying."

Larian在此呈现的，远非寻常意义上的电子游戏。
作为游戏，各种设计完美衔接，恰到好处；自由度高到令人发指，你可以做你自己；装备/等级/数据都是精心设计，兼顾了最大公约数；
作为音乐，Down by the river随河风飘扬成流动的叙事，I Want to Live在抉择时刻撕开灵魂，The Power见证胜利后紧握棱镜的双手，各类主题曲契合场景主题，已然挣脱媒介的桎梏，变成可以交互的交响诗，让我事后还反复专门聆听感慨；
作为剧本，这内容本身就是很精彩的小说，作者们绝对有撰写一部畅销魔幻小说的深厚功力。正义/邪恶，生存/死亡，杀戮/放生等人性和生命的主题引人哲思；如果去电影院是用2.5h欣赏了一部有深度的电影，那么在BG3，你是用100h+去体验有无奈有选择有善恶的跌宕魔幻人生。
我把游戏结束后在营地跟大家聊天的最后存档命名“Do not want to say Farewell”，一路走来，跟这堆朋友和战友同甘共苦，真的希望能一起继续生活下去，最后营地跟大家聊天穷尽选项，试图寻找更多的互动，特别是跟影心的七八次拥抱还留有数据的余温，舍不得说再见。但是Larian残忍又仁慈地让每个同行者带着伤痕继续前行——有人背负星辰远征，有人归于市井炊烟。这何尝不是最温柔的现实主义：所有相遇终究要归还给时光。
至此，我的龙与地下城故事已封存在剑湾的晚风中，有生之年，我还会再体验阿斯代伦和其它角色的一生。或许这正是CRPG的伟大之处：它允许我们在现实生活的夹缝里，体验无数个未曾活过的自己。

虽然也能看到一些对BG3批评改进的意见，但是瑕不掩瑜，个人认为有些地方确实可以再改进以方便玩家，有些意见却是因人而异而不能算作缺点和批评。
当你花了10-15h去学习这个游戏的机制和基本原理后跨过门槛，你真的无法想象Larian是如何创作出这样一部伟大作品的。如果这部作品无法被超越，是因为她确实太精湛也值得珍惜。如果被超越，那么游戏史上又多了另一颗明珠，也是我们的另一份礼物。

A Love Letter to the Ninth Art – A Middle-Aged Player's 100-Hour Journey Through Baldur's Gate 3

As someone nearing forty, with both elderly parents and young children to care for, finding large chunks of time to sit in front of a computer and savor a game is no easy feat. This Spring Festival, I made up my mind to finally taste this cup of coffee that had been brewing for years. With the understanding and support of my wife (for which I am deeply grateful), I managed to carve out a week to indulge in uninterrupted play. After 99 hours and 40 minutes, I completed the game. Sitting in front of the screen late at night, I was left in awe, unable to shake the profound impact it had on me. This journey will undoubtedly remain one of the most unforgettable experiences of my life, a radiant milestone in my personal gaming history.

What Larian has created here is far from an ordinary video game.

As a game, every design element is seamlessly integrated, perfectly balanced. The freedom it offers is almost overwhelming—you can truly be yourself. The equipment, levels, and stats are meticulously crafted, catering to a broad spectrum of players.

As music, Down by the River drifts with the breeze, becoming a flowing narrative. I Want to Live tears at your soul during moments of decision, and The Power resonates as you grasp the prism in victory. Each theme song fits its scene so perfectly that it transcends the medium, transforming into an interactive symphonic poem that I found myself revisiting and reflecting on long after the game had ended.

As a novel, the content itself is a masterful piece of fantasy literature. The writers clearly possess the skill to craft a best-selling fantasy novel. Themes of justice versus evil, life versus death, and killing versus sparing provoke deep philosophical reflection. If watching a movie in a theater is like spending 2.5 hours appreciating a thought-provoking film, then Baldur's Gate 3 is like spending over 100 hours living a tumultuous, magical life filled with difficult choices and moral dilemmas.

I named my final save file in the camp, where I chatted with everyone before the end, ""Do Not Want to Say Farewell."" After journeying together, sharing both hardships and triumphs with these friends and comrades, I truly wished we could continue living together. I exhausted every dialogue option in the camp, searching for more interactions, especially with Shadowheart, whose seven or eight hugs still lingered with the warmth of data. I couldn’t bear to say goodbye. Yet, Larian, in their cruel yet merciful way, allowed each companion to move forward with their scars—some destined to carry the stars on their shoulders, others to return to the mundane life of hearth and home. This, perhaps, is the most tender form of realism: all encounters must eventually be returned to the passage of time.

Thus, my Dungeons & Dragons tale has been sealed in the evening breeze of the Sword Coast. In this lifetime, I will return to experience the lives of Astarion and other characters. Perhaps this is the greatness of CRPGs: they allow us, in the crevices of our real lives, to live countless versions of ourselves we never had the chance to be.

While there are some criticisms and suggestions for improvement regarding BG3, they are minor blemishes on an otherwise flawless gem. Some aspects could indeed be tweaked for player convenience, while others are subjective preferences rather than flaws.

Once you’ve spent 10-15 hours learning the game’s mechanics and fundamental principles, crossing that threshold, you can’t help but marvel at how Larian managed to create such a masterpiece. If this work remains unrivaled, it’s because it is truly exquisite and deserves to be cherished. If it is ever surpassed, then another jewel will have been added to the annals of gaming history, another gift for us all.

Thank you, Larian. | This is probably going to be one of the best games for the next decade, the voice acting is sublime and the writers seemed to have made deals with the devil in order to make such a good tale. 10/10 | The replayability of this game is insane, Larian did an amazing job giving us exactly what we wanted and maybe even a little more.

100 hours: How dare you look down on me, thinking like you could ever defeat me?! Hit me with all you got, it will never be enough!

I found the gameplay getting a bit stale by the end once you have recruited all the knights which you like, and unlocked the 3rd (and final) tier of abilities. That being said there is a wide variety of abilities to experiment with and upgrade; different classes each have their own speciality, and each character having a slightly different set of abilities from others of that class. The abilities themselves were fun to use, and you can synergize the abilities of your character with your equipment, and with your other characters. 

There are a few different groups of enemies each with a number of different classes, but you fight so that I found it getting repetitive. It would have been nice for the different enemy types to gain more abilities or mechanical changes throughout the game, eg: undead which you fight from the very beginning to end of the game.

The story is interesting enough and a fun twist on the classic tale and cast of King Arthur. Between each main mission there are side missions you can do, including ones which allow you to recruit new characters, which kept things interesting. There is a small kingdom management portion which allows you to choose what to upgrade to customize some benefits. 

The setup of the game is one where you have many more characters than you can take on each mission, and seems to encourage you to switch them out. If characters take enough damage in a mission they get permanent debuffs which can only be healed by sitting out at least one mission. I don't really enjoy those types of mechanics, but the game wasn't so difficult on hard that it came up much. You can save freely throughout missions so if you want you could certainly avoid that mechanic entirely if you only want to use the same 4 knights the whole game.

There is a morality chart where you will make choices between two options of religion and ruling style, with different unlocks when you reach certain points in each direction. This included the ability to unlock some characters which was great, but I didn't find the other unlocks that interesting of useful. The morality chart will also change a few side missions which was cool

Overall the game is fun and a nice mix of tactics and RPG, but not amazing and gets a bit stale after the first half. 

3.5/5 | Жесткая игра. Тут зачастую надо думать как шахматист - иначе миссию не пройти со сложностью не ниже среднего уровня. 

Я прошёл всё - от компании до режима схватки, все DLC к этой игре. Заняло около 180 часов. Крутые видеоролики к картам, большое количество комбинаций героев к миссиям - можно проходить как душе угодно. Да, некоторые миссии трудные, но нравилось составлять стратегию для прохождения задач. Рекомендую. | Great challenging tactical turn based combat. Story and voice acting are good. Good depth of different team synergies and classes. Enemy variety struggles a bit towards the end of the campaign. Morality system and perma death make the game more engaging. 
Overall great fantasy tactics game. | Хорошая тактика, но разрабы прям переборщили с кол - вом битв и противников, на середине начинаешь прям уставать и игра начинает тебя душить. В целом, если играть небольшими сессиями - то нормально, и только если вы в принципе любите пошаговые тактики | After spending 130 hours on this game, I will say that it has good potential and a few good ideas but unfortunately many things are poorly developed and this overall pushes me to recommend it only when on sale.

The good: the graphics are nice, the music is great and the game system is at least interesting.

The mediocre: the loot system is a bit too ""hit or miss"", the roster of heroes is excessively restrictive.

The negative: the story is written rather badly, and the effect is exacerbated by voice actors who with a couple of exceptions sound terribly amateurish; the heroes' talents are overall not very customizable, especially for those that are obtained in more advanced stages of the game and that have entire unmodifiable sections; the cover system is poorly implemented and in the vast majority of the game it is irrelevant if not entirely absent.

The really bad: the difficulty curve, especially in the transition from the campaign to the end game, is abismally done (at least in hard mode): suddenly you find yourself in rooms full of enemies with insane amounts of hit points and armor, rows and rows of tanks (litterally) that hit like tons of bricks and protect archers and mages in rooms that, as mentioned, have no cover wahtsoever.... and all this while the heroes who until the previous mission managed to eliminate their opponents in a few hits now seem to have become all anemic. This does not make the game challenging, it makes it exhausting and boring.","I found the gameplay to be stale after the first half.

There's no happy middle ground, which exists in more carefully and comprehensively made strategy games. It's not particularly buggy, and the points at which this game diverges from most other 4x games are done well, fun and engaging, but it doesn't help basic enjoyment for the same reasons most other 4x games fail. Beyond the first few hours (10-16, depending how slow you play) going through major factions in their scenarios, it's just a grind of not a fun variety. I tried and tried to make it fun, but it's not working.

Only major factions of each scenario are not frustrating to play, but if you play them - it's easy to snowball without any checks and then steamroll everyone. It's ridiculous. Minor factions are doomed to die to a big blob formed by major faction and their con/federation, or get slowly torn apart, with no resources to rebuild because most neighbors are at war with them or refusing to trade anyway, and keep stealing trades in either case. Small emergent factions that pop up during the game are even worse than minor factions. No fun.

Interface is clunky, with misclicks being severely punishing for no good reasons and no ability to remap some crucial controls to make it at least a little less clunky.

Resource management sucks. You either have nowhere near enough of anything for everything you need to begin having fun, or within 10 turns after you solve that shortage - you have so much, that you'll just click on everything you can spend your resources and snowball. Trade is only worth anything if you're short on something in the first 5-10 turns, or try to appease AI faction with gifts (which will come back to haunt you, with all the units and development they get from it).

Military sucks, as per usual in 4x. Seemingly without any economic consequence, AI will keep sh***ing out units with all the bonuses and wear down whatever few units you manage to raise from the crappy start you were given as any minor faction. Or if your enemy is of slightly easier variety - you'll steamroll them, bump up into a big blob on your borders and then get bent yourself, or get locked into a boring slogfest. No matter how much you stack up your bonuses and morale - you're never on par. You're either completely dominant or destroyed easily, and unlike AI you can't spam units to get by without quality - you won't have trade to support that. You can't besiege cities or try to turn enemy units to your side either - because bigger factions will come after you, as soon as that ""dishonest"" way of fighting ruins your relations with them.

Diplomacy sucks, par for the course in most 4x games. Pointless cooldowns for diplomatic actions, which exist only to get eaten up by trash offers from AI as soon as the cooldown expires, resetting it, and preventing you from offering anything actually useful. Even then, there's practically no point trying to engage with its mechanisms to play peacefully and develop - which is required if you try to keep up with the blob. Returning back to trade, it's incredibly slow to setup and should go in the same trash bin with cooldowns. Other than military force within your own borders, there's no hard counter to ""peaceful"" units - generals and emissaries, who will screw your plans over, while heroes and sages are practically useless. And there's nothing you can do about them in foreign courts. Trying to force peace between smaller factions, or getting AI into a war is a worthless endeavor too.

Some common scenarios you'll have to go through: You try to make AI players unite against a big blob that threatens you and everyone else - they'll reveal your emissary efforts instead, ruin your relations with the blob, have it declare war on you and kill you with a 1000 cuts. By some miracle you ally to the blob or otherwise keep them appeased? They either break any alliances and good relations to declare war on you, or drag you into their war with another faction - which will inevitably focus on you instead of your ""ally"". You try to praise the blob to other factions, to raise relations - peace accepted, another war declared soon after anyway.  You're successful and the blob is beaten back? They won't accept peace, and will come back with more units. You beat them properly by destroying them and taking territory? Fun's over - now you're the blob, and the rest of the game goes on easy mode. Capital city and morale mechanics only makes snowballing worse, while countering negatives to that snowballing is too easy to even consider a speedbump. You're lucky and none of that happens? Blob steals your neighboring territory, forcing you to either declare war and lose, or get stuck in slow and pointless peaceful development, before eating you up anyway.

If it's the only 4x you're going to play - it's decent, nothing special against recommending it, especially since it has a very thorough and useful manual. If it's one of a few (2-3) similar 4x games that you'll have in the library and actually play - it will scratch the itch differently, whenever any other one gets boring. But unfortunately it won't be anything special otherwise. | Great 4X game, though has historical maps too. Seems simple at first but I was pleasantly surprised by the level of depth.

Things I love:
- AI does not cheat, ie doesn't get bonuses unless you specifically choose to give it to them. At start of the scenario you can increase their cunning without giving them extra production.
- Resources matter, so you need to plan ahead and consider what you might be short of in 20 turns say.
- Eg Slaves are a resource. So it you have too few slaves, the productivity of your mines are reduced, so it's very tempting to enslave the population of captured settlements.
- Combat is brutal but often your unit will not be destroyed, so you have to consider whether to send them back to heal, or continue the fight
- AI is brutal, and often takes advantage of poor unit positioning by me to wipe out my units
- Trading with AI is well implemented. They consider how valuable each resource is to them, at that particular time, and will consider your trade proposal accordingly.
- Also, you can initiate a trade conversation with offer/request and ask them to propose what they want/offer. So trade is more viable.
- Trade is subject to losses but you can build roads between you and other party's settlements to reduce loss during transportation.
- Trading with immediate neighbours has lower losses so is more lucrative. So you have an incentive to get on with your neighbours...even though that mine of theirs next to your border would really help with your iron shortfall...
- It's harder to paint the map, ie conquer the world. As you grow you gain more corruption, which reduces your efficiency.
- You can make war plans with the AI! Eg I'll declare war on X and attack settlement A in 5 turns, while you declare war on X too and attack settlement B. So you can coordinate wars against powerful factions...and they can do the same to you.
- You can peacefully annex factions, if you get on really well and help them with trades they need.
- Neutral factions (essentially barbarian settlements), will occasionally form a new faction. So they are another player that you now have diplomatic relations with. Happened twice in my current game. So you have to decide, do you want peace with them so you can direct your forces to other borders, or do you want to crush them quickly before these barbarians start developing their lands and making better units.
- If an enemy settlement is well defended, you can siege it by taking the lands around it so its population starts to starve. However, all other factions see this as a war crime and you will damage your relationship with them.
- So much depth, I could go on...

It's largely a war game. You can't easily sit back and play tall. You need to be expanding and attacking your weaker neighbours, or preparing to do so in future. Your neighbours might betray you if you are much weaker than them. | So, the big selling point of the game is that it is ""historical"" in its mechanics: training a unit directly drains manpower from your cities, if you train in cities that have low morale/loyalty, the units will have correspondingly low morale/loyalty, there's a supply system, yada yada. 

Once you get through the baffling UI and the hit and miss game manual, the game is quite fun. However, you notice quite quickly some weirdly ahistorical things going on such as Rome or Macedon being squashed by their smaller neighbours in 4 out of 5 games (who knew the Samnites and Epirus were actually antique superpowers?), independent barbarian tribes somehow managing an militaro-industrial complex that produces military units back to back with no consequence for their cities or their economy (considering these units have a bonus fighting in hill and forests well...you get thrashed quite easily. Oh yeah, they also raid your mines and temples and cities lol), Sparta popping out babies in the greek wars scenarios as if their crippling manpower and lack of citizens problems was but a historian's drunk rambling...

But I mean, as I said, the game IS quite fun.

However, you sometimes get absolute game-breaking events that kill your fun on the spot. For example, plagues and other disasters. You can turn those off but in my first game with Athens I thought 'yeah, lets see if Pericles dies for real of the plague!"" (difficulty: medium).

Well fuck, did he die. Him and 60% OF THE ATHENIAN AND ATTICA POPULATION. Seems like the ancient world got plagues that were somehow twice as worst as the black plague of the 14th century. And it's not like I did nothing - once Athens got hit, I got the ""sanitation"" decision. Supposedly, sanitation ""prevents the spread of the plague"" buy emergy building of sewers that last for 5 turns.... Yeah actually that's not true, the turn right after, all of the cities that had sanitation got the plague. There's also an option of martial law for the plague. Did it make a difference apart from making my global happiness plummet to the level of the Styx? Honestly, not that I can tell.

Athens got the plague FOR 12 TURNS, each turn losing about 10% of the pop, which in turn crashes the economy, making it almost impossible to pay the Hoplites and triremes and peltasts, who eventually get the plague as well, which in turn lowers their manpower, making them sweet sweet pickings for the enemies around. In total, my global pop plummeted from 140 pop to about 45. Meanwhile Sparta got it, had it badly for 8 turns and voila! No more plague! Also, thanks to their super effective baby-Agoge producing facilities, I got steamrolled pretty easily afterwards. 

In the end, the game is still quite fun, like a more complex Civilization game, but be aware that sometimes the fun just goes running out of the window naked because of baffling gameplay choices from the devs (an earthquake followed by a flood of the tiber on turn 15 of my second Rome game? really?? ok I got my lesson, no more ""disasters"" option). | So far 8/10...Review to be updated... | Really liking this game so far.","I'm not sure what the game is about, but it's not bad.

With the number of hours I'd played I even spent over 100$ supporting the game by buying skins and what not. I enjoyed the flow, the challenge, and the strategy. I know every card. How they're played. How they're countered. 

So why am I giving it a negative review now?  I recently came back to it to find out the game had completely changed. 

Why oh why have the devs decided to remove wild cards (doubles of the same card in the same deck) and duplicate cards (the same card in your teammates deck) in premade team battles?? Half the fun of this game was being able to strategize with a friend and come up with crazy combos, thematic decks, and sometimes just plain goofy ridiculous decks early in the league. I strongly believe the percent chance of drawing a deck defining card or executing your intended combo is a key element of dueling cards in general. Think Magic or Yu Gi Oh. Now a huge part of that fun and build design is just gone.

Effectively, they've changed the game that I originally fell in love with and after over 800 hours I don't think I want to play anymore. What a shame. | Rating: 7/10

Overview: Minion Masters is a fast-paced, free-to-play strategy game that blends elements of tower defense and collectible card games (CCG). Developed by BetaDwarf, the game pits players in 1v1 or 2v2 battles where they summon and control minions to battle against their opponent’s forces, all while managing a deck of cards. With its unique mix of gameplay styles, Minion Masters offers an accessible but strategic experience for fans of both strategy games and card battling.

Gameplay: In Minion Masters, players build and use decks of cards to summon minions, cast spells, and build structures on the battlefield. Each card corresponds to a different type of unit, spell, or structure that players can deploy in real-time. The key to success is not just about deploying powerful units but also about managing your resources (mana), timing your plays, and reacting to your opponent’s strategy.

The game offers several different modes, including standard 1v1 and 2v2, where players can compete against other players or AI. The matches are quick, lasting around 5-10 minutes, which makes it easy to jump into a game and not get bogged down by long sessions. The action is fast-paced, with constant back-and-forth gameplay, making it exciting for those who enjoy real-time strategy with a bit of card game strategy mixed in.

Deck Building and Strategy: The strategic depth of Minion Masters comes from deck building. Players can collect new cards and customize their deck to suit their playstyle, with different minions, spells, and special abilities available to choose from. The key to winning is finding the right balance between offense and defense, while also considering synergy between the cards in your deck. There are a variety of minion types, each with strengths and weaknesses, which adds an extra layer of tactical decision-making to each match.

Progression and Monetization: As with many free-to-play games, Minion Masters includes a progression system where players can unlock new cards and cosmetics by earning rewards from matches or purchasing card packs. While the game is generally balanced and not pay-to-win, there is an option for players to spend money on card packs and other cosmetic items. This could give some players a slight advantage early on, but most progress can still be made through regular gameplay.

Graphics and Performance: Minion Masters features bright, colorful visuals with a somewhat cartoonish art style that fits the fast-paced, playful nature of the game. The minions and spells are well-designed, with each card having its own unique look and animations that help bring the battlefield to life. The game runs smoothly on most systems, and the controls are intuitive, making it accessible for both new players and strategy veterans alike.

Audio Design: The sound design in Minion Masters is solid, with an upbeat soundtrack and engaging sound effects that add to the excitement of the battles. Each card and minion has its own set of sounds, from the footsteps of marching troops to the explosive effects of spells, helping to immerse players in the game’s action. The voice lines of the minions and the announcer are charming and add some personality to the game.

Challenges: While Minion Masters is accessible, there is a learning curve when it comes to building effective decks and mastering the timing and positioning of your units. As players unlock more cards, they can start building more diverse strategies, but the game’s fast pace means you need to react quickly, which can be challenging for newcomers. The game also features matchmaking, but occasionally, you may find yourself up against opponents who have stronger cards if you're not progressing quickly enough.

Final Thoughts: Minion Masters is a fun and fast-paced strategy game that offers a unique blend of collectible card gameplay with real-time strategy. Its quick matches, deck-building mechanics, and strategic depth make it an enjoyable experience for players who enjoy both card games and strategy games. While there’s a progression system that could feel grindy at times, the game remains accessible, and its focus on skill and strategy makes it rewarding for those who stick with it.

Pros:

Fast-paced and accessible gameplay
Strong strategic depth through deck-building and unit placement
Bright, colorful visuals with appealing animations
Free-to-play with fair monetization options
Multiple game modes including 1v1 and 2v2
Cons:

Progression can feel slow at times
Pay-to-progress elements, though not pay-to-win
Some balancing issues, especially at early levels
Can become repetitive if not switching up strategies
Minion Masters is an enjoyable strategy game for those who like quick battles, tactical decision-making, and card collection. While there are some minor progression hurdles, the game offers a solid and fun experience for fans of competitive, strategic gameplay. | This game was fun for a while. I found it late thinking it was a new game. After several months of loving it and playing it almost daily; the fun is now at its end. Nothing new is coming to it. | ""Если бы мне сказали, что я буду проводить ночи напролет, крича на экран из-за толпы миньонов, я бы не поверил. Но вот я здесь, с кругами под глазами и улыбкой до ушей. Minion Masters — это как смесь покера, шахмат и цирка, где все участники слегка не в себе.

Что мне нравится:

Миньоны-психопаты. Серьезно, кто еще будет бросать летающих свиней в драконов? Это гениально!

Стратегия? Шутка? И то, и другое! Ты думаешь, что всё продумал, но тут твой противник выкидывает карту, которая превращает твою армию в лягушек. Лягушек, Карл!

Быстрые матчи. Это как фастфуд, только без угрызений совести. 5 минут — и ты либо герой, либо лузер. Но в любом случае хочется еще.

Что не нравится:

Случайные карты. Иногда тебе выпадает такая рука, что хочется плакать. Но это часть веселья, правда?

Итог: Minion Masters — это идеальная игра для тех, кто хочет немного адреналина, много смеха и возможность почувствовать себя злым гением (или просто неудачником с хорошим чувством юмора). Если вы еще не играли, то что вы вообще делаете со своей жизнью?

It looks simple and it is easy to learn but its mechanics are very deep and complex. Take sea battles, for example. For a start, you have a simple ship with simple cannons. They can shoot... and that's about it. But! Even at this early stage you see glimpses of the deep that hides under the surface. Because your ship, simple as it is, has 3 different speeds according to the wind's direction, cargo space, hull strength and crew... which consists of distinct characters, every one of which can be trained in any unlocked class, equipped with your chosen weapons, trinkets and consumables. Why is it so important? Because during sea battles you can board all enemy ships and even many of the sea monsters - and they can board you - initiating a tactical battle using your crew! And this is only the beginning. Your cannons have different firing distances and firing angles, you can find and/or buy beam cannons, lightning cannons, slowing cannons, cannons that freeze enemies and even water on the map, cannons that have 360 degree firing angle, cannons that damage enemy crew... You can add a lot of different ships to your fleet - ironclads, living regenerating ships, even some of the monsters that you fight. 
Simple in concept, very deep and satisfying in further study.
It can be said about land (or boarding) battles also. You are controlling a party of 5 characters each of whom can have a combination of 2 classes chosen freely that give you all told about 12 active abilities to use in battle... for EACH CHARACTER. We are looking at a whopping 60 abilities in total - and it is without taking into account different consumables and weapons that your characters can have. As a bonus - enemies are working under the same rules as you. They can also have these classes and abilities. They can also have these weapons and consumables. And they can use them pretty intelligently. And this is not all! Maps themselves are no less important. They are full of different hazards, height differences and opportunities. Push an enemy off a cliff! Push an enemy into a wall! Push an enemy into another enemy! Rain water onto them! And then electrify or freeze it! You can walk on ice, you can chop down trees, you can cut or burn away grass, you can blow up walls... Battlefield is changeable and destructible - and it is glorious.
I can rant for a long time, but I'll stop here. Horizon's Gate gives players a large and beautiful world to explore and plunder. I've bought this game on sale because it is the first game from this developer for me and I was not sure I'll like it. I've already bought their next game - Kingsvein - at full price without a doubt. Because I am sure now.
And I hope that we will see Horizon's Gate 2 someday. Sea exploration and battles gel very nicely with amazing tactical combat and a vibrant world that this developer created. I want more. | Que jogo sensacional
Exploração bacana com um mundo grande, com várias dungeons (apesar que simples, sendo que a maioria são só duas salas) e muitas cidades, combate tático que não depende tanto da movimentação e ambiente, mas que entretêm, principalmente pelo sistema de classes, que é viciante e a cereja do bolo é a trilha sonora, que é excelente
O foco tá longe de ser a história, mas é legal e tem uma dungeon inteira fora da casinha pra explicar ela
Não instalei muitos mods, mas tem vários que adicionam muito conteúdo, como quests, locais, classes, mudanças no gameplay, etc.
Se esse jogo tivesse um orçamento um pouco maior para aprofundar o lore dos personagens e os gráficos, seria uma obra prima | Great game that punches way above its weight class.

If you like exploration in games, tactics games, and role-playing games you will love Horizon's Gate. I really like sailing around, trading, and discovering new areas on the map. Building your landing crew for the FF tactics-esque combat is also a lot of fun. I do wish more of the recruit-able party members had a bit of a personality. But, this is a more game-play focused game so I can let it slide. Overall it is a great deal full price and actually a steal when it goes on sale. I'm leaving this review so hopefully this game can get more attention :) | What a hidden gem of a game.

Jede Art Planet hat ""Rezepte"", wie man ihn nutzen kann, wenn man ihn kolonisiert. Es geht darum, ein florierendes Netzwerk zwischen den Planeten aufzubauen. 

Dabei gibt's eine Vielzahl von Problemen zu managen: Am Anfang fragt man sich, lieber schnell etwas zum Laufen bringen, um frühes Geld zu verdienen oder lieber erst die ganze Umgebung entdecken, um die Konstellationen zu optimieren? Im mittleren Spiel sollte man neben den klassischen Strategie-Dilemmas (zuerst Wirtschaft ausbauen oder Forschung?) immer auch die bestehende Infrastruktur im Blick haben - oft entstehen im Spielverlauf noch Möglichkeiten zur Verbesserung. Und gegen Spielende willst Du immer mehr expandieren, aber ab einer gewissen Anzahl Planeten wird alles exorbitant teuer. 

Hohe Varianz durch die Auswahl der Völker beim Spielstart. Die Völker haben eine klare Identität (auf welche Spielmechaniken und Spielstile sie sich beziehen), aber in jeder Partie bieten sie eine andere Auswahl an Technologien aus ihrem Pool an. Dadurch spielen sich die Partien vom Anfang bis Schluss sehr unterschiedlich.
Im Standardmodus gibt es zusätzlich noch ""Modifikatoren"", die die Eigenschaften der Karte verändern, auf der man spielt. Die sollte man für die ersten Runden erstmal ausschalten, weil das Grundspiel schon abwechslungsreich genug ist. Wenn man das Spiel besser kennt, sind sie sicher eine willkommene Abwechslung.
Es gibt auch eine Kampagne mit etwas mehr Story, aber ich finde den Standardmodus eigentlich genau richtig! | It's fun. I like it. It's the sort of space-based resource management game that appeals to my brain. Getting things to work is very satisfying! Not having that ONE RESOURCE you need within range is VERY FRUSTRATING! It's a good game to start up when you want to play SOMETHING and aren't sure what. Standard runs are pretty quick. There's still plenty of the game that I haven't interacted with, yet, at 10 hours in. If it looks like the sort of thing you would also like, I highly recommend it. | The game seems simple at first but optimizing for maximum efficiency is very tricky and satisfying to learn. Discovering all the interactions between mechanics has been very addicting and fun. Instantly one of my favorite games of all time. | Un bon jeu d'optimisation en environnement incertain. C'est paradoxalement un bon jeu de détente où le fait de se casser la tête n'a pas d'autre implication que d'avancer plus loin dans le temps et d'avoir un meilleur score. 
But du jeu: coloniser des planètes pour obtenir des ressources, qui elles-même demandent des ressources. Il faudra donc explorer votre espace, coloniser des planètes, puis les relier entre elles (sans croisement, d'où la difficulté). Un fois établie, de nouvelles ressources sont demandées, etc.
Le retour dans le temps permet aussi de faire des tests si on est pas sûr à 100% de notre coup, ou si on fait une erreur (attention cependant, il n'est valable que si les inconnues le reste, donc pas d'exploration). Les parties sont assez courtes (entre 1 et 2 heures selon votre réflexion), et la rejouabilité assez énorme (entre les bonus de races, les technologies, les types de systèmes et les anomalies si on les actives, on a de quoi faire).

En bref, un bon jeu de réflexion (d'optimisation) qui vous fera perdre la notion du temps. | Slipways is refreshingly different by being simple and compact.

There is a huge potential in the game for replay and replay and replay. My issue with this game is it does tend to be painfully tedious. There is no real guidance as to what a player should be focusing on within a particular journey to the end. If the goal is a Military victory, that's pretty basic stuff. Everybody knows how to accomplish that. But if a player decides not to pound all the others into oblivion, it can become a bit problematic trying to figure out how to ""win"".

I have no intention of playing this game again until there are appropriate updates to the game.

Why? Because I want a roadmap for 2025! In my oppinion this game deserves it!

The game is imo the best competitor to CIV as of now, with fresh ideas, regarding replay (timeline can be changed significantly by choosing), tile system and strategy (focus trees). 
Each of the ideas are great, I love the immersion that they generate, which are not broken by the alternative histories. Damn I even love the graphics; they feel more realistic than Comic CIV 6. 

The game for sure has it's weaknesses, especially in CPU AI (weaker than CIV, but similar problems), balance (the game for sure is not perfect for Min Maxers), and the super prolonged late  game (CIV has a similar problem)

So the game is definitely not for everyone (especially min maxers won't like aspects). But in my oppinion it brings enough fresh air to be exciting for a lot of hours. Hopefully the game gets a roadmap for 2025! | CIV war gestern! 
Ich habe sämtliche Teile CIVILISATION Runde um Runde gesuchtet und deshalb viele Stunden Schlaf verloren. Doch Paradox hat es endlich geschafft den behebigen König vom Thron zu stoßen. Da wo sich CIV immer wieder in überheblicher Selbstherrlichkeit neu erfunden hat und am Ende doch jedes mal wieder nur langweilig an der Oberfläche geblieben ist, weil irgendwelche interessanten Spielmechaniken rausgeflogen sind, legt Millenia erst richtig los. DER KÖNIG IST TOT! LANG LEBE KÖNIGIN MILLENIA! 

Wie so oft bei Paradox dauert es zwar eine Weile bis ihre Spiele die Kurve bekommen, aber mit den beiden DLC´s ist es jetzt mein klarer Favorit in der gesamten X4 Welt! 

Okay an manchen Stellen wirken die ansich interessanten Entscheidungen etwas deplatziert, wenn man z.B. einen Händler mit Diplomatiepunkten erkauft oder Religion mit Kultur, aber die zugrunde liegende Spielmechanik finde ich dennoch sehr viel besser als bei vergleichbaren Titeln. Ich denke hier wird noch ordentlich was kommen und es ist in meinen Augen viel spannender als bloß immer nur alle Punkte (Bau/Forschung/Kultur, etc.) nach oben zu treiben wie bei CIV. Bei Millenia muss man sich viel öfter für einen Weg entscheiden und dafür andere (auch) gute Vorteile erst einmal liegen lassen.

Klare Kaufempfehlung!! Insbesondere wenn Du so wie ich bei den Ankündigungen zu CIV VII die Hände über dem Kopf zusammengeschlagen hast ; / 

Jetzt ist es eine kleine Liebeshymne für Millenia geworden... aber zurecht, danke ins Paradox-Team! 

F*** CIV6,7,8,9,10. I´m out finally! | tl;dr - Not recommended at full price, but a fun diversion at a discount

The game offers some interesting ideas but in the end, if you're looking for a 4X fix, there are better options.

I found the graphics decent, particularly the geography. Unit graphics, especially in the battle viewer, are more lacking, and their animations especially so. Watching a three-deck ship of the line bouncing like a bathtub toy when hit in battle, or a knight charging across the screen while his horse's legs remain still are somewhat immersion breaking.

I like the Ages mechanic. it offers a good way to put together broader changes in society with the advance of time and technology without making everything ever done a separate individual technology. I particularly liked that barbarians go away after reaching a particular age. The variant ages are an interesting idea, allowing small changes to gameplay.  The downside of the ages is that technologies are unlocked by the ages and have no other prerequisite, leading to some definitely ahistorical progressions.

Different unit types are a good idea but they didn't actually have a big impact on my own play style. I mixed my armies and navies up a little and otherwise forgot about it.

Your opponents are pretty interchangeable. The difference between China and Rome and Canada are just the colors of their banners.

I found domestic trade routes very frustrating. A region can only trade with one other region, regardless of how many different trades they can have, which means you can't easily establish a region to, for example, supply oil to the rest of your empire. Or be the equivalent of Pennsylvania and send steel to Detroit and New York for their industry. This is perhaps the biggest failure in my opinion.

I found vassals to be a so-so idea. they provide passive income to you but they also don't defend themselves. All cities do have militia to defend themselves even if there are no units garrisoning them, but vassals can't create additional defensive units. They'll also leave pillaged improvements unrepaired, even when they're able to build new ones. The urge was often strong to take over a vassal, fix their crap, and then release them again just so I didn't have to see burning farms turn after turn.

No aircraft carriers in the game. WTF? The only mobile defense against enemy bombers on land or sea is providing fighter cover. Making outposts is certainly a way to extend the reach of your air force but many times I had to advance without air cover for my armies or navies.

Late game performance is frustratingly slow. I set my regions to work on a colony ship and then spent the last twenty or thirty turns just clicking 'end turn' and waiting 30 seconds so I could click it again. My system is less than recommended, though, being a Ryzen 3600X with 36GB RAM. | Disclaimer: I have not played multiplayer, as it wasn't funcional at game release. 

The graphics primitive, but very functional. UI works. I didn't encounter any major bugs or crashes.

Choosing a civ at the start is entirely cosmetic, but I thigk all things considered that that is a plus. Flavor/Culture is instead derived from national spirits that you pick each age. It solves the feeling of cultural stagnancy that sticking with a static civ throughout the game gives, allowing for a civilizational narrative, but without without breaking immersion (as in humankind and presumably civ 7 when it comes out) due to switching to discontinuous cultures, such as transforming from Sumeria to the Celts, Ethiopia to China, or Inca to France.

Ages are pretty neat. They veer into mythology alternate-history and science-fiction, and make for a lot of replayability, as your options and short term objectives can vary wildly between games. The world itself is reactive to the actions of players. Researchable technology differs based on through which age you progress into. Crisis and Challenge ages are damaging/powerful. Being able to plunge the entire world into chaos with an age of plague, conquest, or the AI uprising, for instance, with your own actions is fun in singleplayer (it might get annoying If you are behind in multiplayer, I wouldn't know.) They also are focal to winning, as different ages offer different win conditions. Being ahead of your opponents at the right time is critical to securing victory.

Internal empire management in this game is really fun and engaging. Setting up supply chains which develop in complexity as technology progresses is very satisfying. It makes natural resources on the map feel much less interchangeable than other games. For example, rice and wheat can both be processed into flour, but rice can also be used to make wine. Best in class in my opinion.

The combat is passable, and not really a focus of strategic gameplay. You build units, move stacks around on the map put in a leader for a % strength bonus, Rock paper scissors, the armies do a little auto-battle thing which shows how the battle went.

Overall, pretty good. Has some unique and good ideas that seperate it from the rest of the genre, definitely not a clone as some have said.","oppinion this game deserves it!

It sucked me in for about three weeks, and now that I am at the end, as much fun as it was, I am glad I'm about to be done.

The gameplay is rather simple: Sidescroller action RPG, you have a shield, a melee weapon, and can unlock a throwing weapon. 3 stats, 6 gear slots, 4 skill trees. You use food to explore the map, discovering new places to travel to, and after clearing them, you can send your workforces to harvest materials: food, wood, stone, etc. which you then use to build your settlement.

While I have a forge, I never actually forged something. Drops were just good enough, and while they aren't overly exciting (mostly just stats go bigger), one or two weapons had nice gimmicks. I never really ran out of materials, though I sometimes had to scout a bit to find more leather or food.

The quest log is more or less useful, leaning towards less. All entries get just listed one after another, and it doesn't mention where something happened. One of my map locations bugged out and had a permanent blinking quest marker on it, while at least one other just kinda. Vanished? I know I had a quest to help some dude across a chasm, but at some point, it was just gone. Was the quest giver killed? Who knows!

Speaking of, there are bounties which spawn once you accept them. I wasn't too amused to realize that those bounties take out friendly NPCs in those locations - especially as one of those locations had wolves I could have taken as followers!! NOT THE PUPPIES!!

Followers. Eh. Without a fully upgraded training ground, they just died on me constantly, and I was playing on easy. You also can't leave them at the camp, so I lost my doggo in a siege event. Sad.

While most areas focus on combat, there are a few containing puzzles. Especially the main quest ""light the beacons"" maps are heavy on the platforming. As someone who hates platforming, it wasn't super hard, but it also wasn't fun. The achievements were all pretty easy to get, and are not tied to the story in any way, all just numbers, so I was done with them long before the end of the story.

The controls take some getting used to. A and D move sideways, that's normal, but W is used to jump, which is not. S is used to go down platforms, but I was unable to go down ladders with it. Who cares, no fall damage, just jump off. I had to rebind a few keys to make it work without me wanting to rip my hair out.

I know this all sounds negative, but what can I say, I was having fun. This game had the perfect low effort gameplay loop I was craving, slowly making my progress across the map, just one more location, one more, one more. While not really gameplay relevant, the different biomes were nice, the pixel is art pretty, and I just had what felt like a constant sense of progression across the board. I don't see much replay value, but I got almost 24 hours out of a game for less than 5 euro on sale, and I think that's pretty neat.

Steam deck specific reasons I cannot really recommend it there (despite having played it on the deck): 
- The launcher is annoying. All launchers are annoying.
- You have to crank interface size way down, because it does not play well at ALL with low resolutions, which makes navigating the map especially tedious. Everything is so small! At the start, every few minutes, I shrank it down another little bit because there was something cut off. Imagine my surprise when I found buttons to press in the corner of the map.
- I didn't give the actual controller support much of a chance, because nothing was explained, jumping was so weird, and I couldn't even figure out how to talk to a guy, and in the end, I just downloaded a much-used community layout and adjusted it for what I needed. I don't think I would have been able to play with either default controls or any of the existing community layouts. | Muito divertido, formas diferentes de jogar e boas referencias. | ★★★☆☆ | 7/10","I'm not sure what to say about this game, but I'm glad I'm done with it.

76561197970698176,34330,Unknown,0.0,,0,"Easily my favourite Total War. In my opinion, the best battle game play by far. It just feels smooth where it needs to be, sharp and responsive and I appreciate the aesthetic design throughout, not just because of the Japanese theme, but the overall tone of the artwork. Also arrows are effective which is nice to see in a TW game. 10/10 and then some with workshop mods. | Total War: Shogun 2 - это суровый мир самураев, династий и стратегических сражений, который сразу же захватил мое внимание. Эта игра не просто стратегия, это целая эпоха, в которой каждый выбор может изменить ход истории. 

Плюсы:
1. Сюжет игры, основанный на исторических событиях, позволяет взять на себя роль одного из кланов и вести его к власти. Это не просто борьба за территорию, но и глубокая стратегическая игра, где нужно учитывать политические интриги, дипломатические отношения и экономическое развитие. Каждый выбор имеет значение, и это придает игре особую глубину.
2. Атмосфера Японии периода Сэнгоку передана с невероятной детализацией для игры 2011 года: от красивых пейзажей до неплохо проработанных юнитов, каждый элемент создает ощущение погружения в игру.
3. Музыкальное оформление заслуживает отдельного лайка! Звуки природы, традиционная японская музыка и эпические мелодии во время сражений создают уникальную атмосферу, которая усиливает погружение в игру.
4. Огромный плюс игры в том, что какую-никакую кампанию можно проходить с другом! Это очень круто, весело и дает больше разнообразия для совместных стратегических действий.

Минусы:
1. Иногда искусственный интеллект может показаться не совсем адекватным, а некоторые элементы управления слишком топорные и требуют времени на привыкание. 
2. В некоторых моментах игра может показаться медленной, особенно в начале, когда нужно развивать экономику и строить армию (на что уходит куча времени).

Total War: Shogun 2 - это великолепное сочетание стратегии и истории, которое оставляет после себя теплые эмоции и желание вернуться в этот удивительный мир. Если вы любите стратегические игры, серию Тотал Вар и просто хотите на чилле/на расслабоне погонять самураев по карте, то, игра вам определенно понравится. | Fuck you corpos for destroying a great game! Can't run mods, and without em still crashes, thx assholes | 全战里最喜欢的一代，即使是十年前的游戏在今天看来依旧雄风犹在，使用reshade后画质甚至已达到了电影级，再者幕府2作为开山之作幕府1的续作，发售之后再次成为全战不得不品的经典之作，全战系列除了几个外传没买都已经有了，战锤3可能对于战锤这个ip来说是史诗级游戏，但作为一款全战来说，我个人而言对此并不满意，单从战斗方面来说，幕府2的精密细节水准无出其右，也是第一部着重于pvp对战平衡来制作的全面战争，在当时具有跨时代的意义，在幕府2之后发售的罗马2则开始沦为血条全战，以及之后的所有作品，全都不再是1对1的战斗，而是血条制度，战斗细节逐渐敷衍，空气刀逐渐盛行，玩起来已然失去了全战该有的精髓，食之无味弃之可惜，这些就像在玩传奇一样无趣，就连战前演讲的设计也被废除了，只有特定的事件战役才有战前演讲，不知是说他越做越大了还是越来越商业了，除了堆量卖dlc就是敷衍中的敷衍，ca的新作法老就是一个最好的例子，也别提因为想要为法老引流宣传对老作品进行强制更新的操作，玩家曾尝试退版本来抗议，但ca一意孤行不为所动，并禁用了退版本的功能，此举导致了幕府2的mod社区遭受重创。地图模组全部失效，武家之殇的mod也出现一些闪退无声音的问题，pvp的聊天功能被删除，除此之外未对游戏推出任何的实质性更新内容，社区管理也只是一味的捂嘴不让说，禁止提出建议，仿佛在ca眼里，他们忠实的老玩家已失去了利用价值，只有迎合战锤的新玩家才是ca目前的摇钱树和救命稻草，三国的停更导致只到汉末，三国也是名存实亡，ca时至今日可惜还是未曾吸取教训，仍然拒绝沟通，一意孤行已成为常态，就看ca他这种态度还能走多远，小心，法老的失败已经使得世嘉逐渐失去耐心，也是不得不重新评估你ca的实际可存价值，下一作如果还是法老这种质量，那离解散重组已不再遥远

其次在上强度之后，游戏会从模拟建设瞬间转化成微操资源管理，人力和资源的极致运用才能让你拿下胜利，你说肉鸽？什么肉鸽？哪有肉鸽？建设？哪有建设？

这不算充足的随机性除了能让你升血压并不能让你的体验得到提升，毕竟这个游戏所有的肉鸽收益基本都是有滞后性的，鲜少有立即生效却对你收益巨大的情况出现，游戏本身也是比起解决问题更倾向于让问题防患于未然，可以说基本都处于一种今日受苦而明日享福的循环，而人往往并不待见延迟满足，这也是城市建造类游戏的通病，随机性则让这一点被增幅了许多，毕竟脸黑一下的话你的精心布局很可能要到游戏尾声才得以找到key牌启动。

在真正上手游戏的中后期，本作特色的“肉鸽”“建设”属性可以说是基本等于没有（甚至肉鸽方面可能是负作用？），冲着这两点来的颇有几分受骗的味道。高强度下的资源匮乏和时间赛跑让游戏的建设属性约等于无，时间全花在拼尽全力管理有效利用资源上，而肉鸽属性正反馈不足，且低难度通解太多、高难度拿不到最优解血压又太高，负反馈很强导致肉鸽的设计很抽象。

相对的，游戏耐玩、结构与内容完整，微创新也不少，上手简单易懂，游戏内有明确的阶段性目标，能让城建玩的少的玩家不至于迷失方向不知道该做什么，每一局的目标不一样一定程度上保持了新鲜感都是值得肯定的优点。

总的来说是值得一个好评的，入手推荐史低，另DLC风评远不如本体，慎入。 | Against the Storm focuses on the best part of a city builder which is the first hours when you are in the building phase.  Against the Storm plays out differently every time because the buildings you start with are always different.   It is a well optimized game, with constant choices of risk vs reward, and enjoyable when you figure out work-arounds for meeting necessary resources, through supply chain management.

What I appreciate about Against the Storm is that there is never is a point where it gets too complicated with too much too deal with at one time.  The equivalent of the ""Boss battle"" is challenging and rewarding.  Graphic and sound design are excellent.

I've played over 650 hours and still not sick of it, so there must be something to this video game.  

Support these devs.  Eremite Games is a Polish developer consisting of six, and they really have created a real gem of a game, and they have been actively improving and polishing the game for more than a year after the day 1 release. | I genuinely started off liking Against the Storm, but the further you get into the difficulties the more tedious it gets, with additional negative modifiers and additional hoops to jump through to complete the session. Each seal completion really incentivizes you to play the next difficulty to get enough shards to complete the next seal to follow the metaplot, and lower difficulties may not get you the number of seals you need in time - additionally, the further out you go, the higher the minimum difficulty of the embarkment is, pushing the player to embark on those higher difficulty options. Why progress the seals other than metaplot? So you get more resources for the Citadel metaprogression. Which does things like add resources to your starting caravan so you can actually build some production buildings at the start, or adding a production building that let you make many key items - poorly, at high cost, but beneficial for the build chains so you are not fully reliant on RNG to get a building to complete the chain, or even adding bonuses to each race in your settlement like showing you where the first set of fields is where you can build a farm the first time you recruit a Human, so you don't have to spend half the session opening the wrong glades and never getting the constant food production that would provide. 

Except like many modern roguelite hybrids, this metaprogression is poorly balanced, and time consuming, which makes it feel like busywork rather than enjoyable on its own. It makes the higher difficulties less tedious to tackle (especially with some of the more helpful bonuses), but it just feels like an absolute chore to get through. Speaking of chores, they just add more chores without opening meaningful doors and mechanics past Veteran in terms of the difficulty options. The first three difficulties add mechanics each jump - after Veteran comes Viceroy, which is the same thing as Veteran with new forbidden and dangerous glade events to threaten your settlement and that the forest is more hostile by a multiplier of x3 instead of x2, but they don't do anything ""new"" really, they are just more of what you have seen before on earlier difficulties, and they just cost a ton of resources that you may not have been able to produce unless you have enough bonuses from the metaprogression tree and otherwise they apply so many negative benefits your game may actually end, such as the Stormbird which as far as I can tell by searching across the internet, people have been complaining is poorly balanced even with a good settlement for years. I don't just mean negatively either - the Stormbird applies an infinite storm effect, locking you to a year until you finish it (which you could delay), which is abusable in its own right if you were lucky enough to find it early. The Stormbird is just absurdly out of band in both directions and I cannot understand the intent of including it compared to every other event. I suppose that its very existence changes the logic pattern of whether you should open forbidden glades at all, but the higher difficulties disincentivize the opening of small glades due to hostility modifiers, so that just leaves dangerous glades if you do not want to starve but want to ensure a manageable event. What a forcible winnowing of the meta - it creates a very rote playstyle even though the apparent point of RNG building choice to create more unstable, dynamic push-and-pull gameplay. 

By the way, the tree also has a level attached - as you go through various sessions you get XP, when you level up you unlock new buildings and cornerstones (buffs) to show up in the game. THIS metaprogression mechanic is where the actual doors are opened for new build orders. Except its just as slow as the tree since its a blocker on the tree - without those later buildings and cornerstones, the game is not necessarily giving you the tools to win on higher difficulties. The amount of XP seems really low as well no matter the difficulty and even with completing various achievement challenges, which just exacerbates the issue.

I assume the decision not to bind those buildings and cornerstones to the higher difficulties and instead to a metaprogression level was so that you can use them on the lower difficulties and practice various build chains, but without overwhelming people when they start to play, and because of the complexity of creating a system that could both leave them default on the higher difficulties and then unlock them for use on the lower one once you cleared the higher one. Though perhaps they could have used their training missions for this. In all honesty the buildings beyond the first few levels matter less than the cornerstones, but they both add to how obnoxious the metaprogression system is - even if it is justified ludonarratively. 

In positives, I genuinely like the give and take between blight and production starting with the Veteran difficulty. I enjoy the season model and how each session naturally pushes you to modify your build chain on the fly or attempt to produce enough of your current resources to trade for the things you need to complete the Orders. I enjoy the fact that a session can take no more than one hour or maybe two at the higher speeds and therefore allows a bite-sized city building experience. I genuinely did get 30 hours out of it so I would say I got my money's worth, and I may play some more now and again, but anything that sufficiently annoys me more than it captivates me gets a negative review especially when the causes will not be immediately apparent to the player. | Let me preface this by saying that the game is very well made and I understand why so many people love it. I am not refunding it for any notable flaws.

For me specifically, when I play this type of game I want to dig in and work on one continuous settlement and make it grow over time, eventually getting to a point where I have this massive city that basically runs itself, giving me a primal sense of satisfaction that doesn't need to be felt again for roughly two years. But this game is a rogue-lite with some aspects of a mobile game, where you constantly restart a 'run', so to speak, unlocking stuff to make things more interesting for the next one. And though well-crafted, it's just not the kind of thing I'm looking for in a city-builder. | 与其说是城市营造或者基地建设，更像是有限资源管理游戏，不符合我的兴趣","Against the Storm is a well optimized game, with constant choices of risk vs reward, and enjoyable when you figure out work-arounds for meeting necessary resources, through supply chain management.

i recommend to watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouSWPM4jfUY

Pixel Sprout games; Artists, programmers, writers, translators and everyone else deserves to be paid properly. they are the only reason this game is what it is. They deserve better and you should be fucking ashamed | I cannot recommend this game, at all. 

I loved this game, I bought it for friends (19 people, I have bought this game for 19 people). It was SDV but fantasy and I loved it, but it really isn't possible for me to recommend this game anymore. I've played this since it was Early Access. I have 380 hours in this game, almost all the achievements. 

The team has consistently dropped the ball with various things:
- no credits for any of the creators, artists, coders, etc
- nintendo switch issues
- issues with the discord and questions not being answered
- people not receiving codes
- constant dlc release
- so many bugs, even on PC (I have lost saves at times)
- awful translations for different languages (with unpaid work)

This could've been something new, something better. And it isn't. The community was horribly failed. Do better, please. Hire more community managers or communicate better. It's unacceptable the amount of times people have brought up in the discord not receiving codes or entirely being ignored. The team does NOT communicate with the player base at all. The switch version was released entirely broken. Nintendo told customers to contact Pixel Sprout for refunds and I saw multiple times that the people asking about that and the refunds were ignored. Only now are they trying to backtrack after all the backlash. I get it that it can cause issues, but communication has been HORRIBLE. At most, they announce ""we know it's broken, and we don't know when it'll be fixed, oopsie"". The radio silence for other players has been disheartening to see. 

The translators at first were volunteers. Then the dev team cut them off and used some stupid AI translation. Then they had people ""volunteer"" to fix their machine translation. 

Employees were also not paid fairly. People were paid well below minimum wage. Everything is out there, just look into it. There's multiple posts from former employees, google documents, tweets-- all have evidence and proof.

People were banned for bringing up concerns in the discord or for speaking up about various issues. I might get banned myself for posting this review. It's unacceptable behavior. Stop being defensive and own up to mistakes. 

As for the actual game? It's cute, the pixel graphics are nice (some of them are wonky). The story is okay. The immersion is pretty good, but it drops the ball in some other areas, like relationships and marriage. NPCs are unique, there's plenty of different characters for everyone. Furniture is still not able to be turned for the majority of things. The story needs to have a lot of retcon or fixing, I think. So far? It's you grind, you go to a elf city, you talk to a dragon. You go to a demon city, then you either give stuff to a dragon or fight it, and then there's nothing after. It's a very boring story in places and very grindy. The seasonal enemies are fun. DLCs are done right only for the sole fact that they're cosmetic only and don't really do much for gameplay itself.

Look into what you're purchasing first. I'm highly disappointed with the team and the way they have behaved as well as the way they have treated the community. I'm not buying any Pixel Sprout games ever again and I'm telling all of my friends, family, even strangers, to do the same. 

Highly recommend Fields of Mistria, Stardew Valley, various other games in that vein as opposed to Sun Haven. I'm sure there are going to be more fantasy stardew-esque games from better developers and better company. | De que adianta ser um jogo bonito se mal pagam os artistas e não dão crédito nenhum pra eles?

Обновления выходят, за что респект разработчику и желаю ему успехов!!!
Игру рекомендую | Fun game with lots of potential. If dev continues to add more combat and magic skills, this could compete with ToME, | I don't recommend this quite yet.

Needs a more fleshed out character creator and magic added before I'd recommend buying. | Me está gustando mucho, tanto que creo que voy a dejar de jugarlo para retomarlo cuando esté completo sin quemarlo, cosa que pasa con los early acces. 

Es un roguelike tradicional de mundo abierto con agradables gráficos y, en general, presenta la información en pantalla de un modo claro. Tiene un sistema de habilidades amplio que evoluciona un poco a lo Skyrim. Me recuerda a Stoneshard pero con más elementos de fantasía tradicional. Tiene un sistema de progresión lento pero bien pensado, muy inmersivo. Parece más bien pensado para jugarlo con posibilidad de guardar y recargar la partida si te matan, en un punto no muy avanzado del juego incluso se hacen referencias a que estás dominando el tiempo al volver de la muerte una y otra vez. Es demasiado tentador no usar el modo permadeath aunque no se juega igual sabiendo que la muerte no penaliza. 

Sobre la partida que estoy jugando. He elegido la clase caballero, uso principalmente espada, ya he aprendido algunos hechizos que sirven para encantar el equipamiento aunque me faltan ingredientes para usar los hechizos. No parece que haya magia activa, de lanzar bolas de fuego, etc. He tenido la suerte de que la granja cercana al pueblo de inicio produce huevos de avestruz, que se regeneran cada poco tiempo, como también se regenera el dinero de los comerciantes. Cada visita a la granja me reporta 20 huevos de media, que se venden a 6 piezas de oro, así que tengo una fuente modesta pero inagotable de ingresos y comida. Además estoy subiendo mi nivel de cocina muy rápido. Como en todo buen roguelike, si algo es susceptible de exploit entonces es lícito explotarlo hasta el infinito para obtener una ventaja, no estoy alterando las reglas que están ahí puestas.

Se me olvidaba comentarlo, puedes robar impunemente.

Todavía no he avanzado mucho en alquimia, me curo usando comida, que te da X turnos de potenciación a la curación, así que en enfrentamientos duros lo que hago es pegar al malo, cuando estoy bajo de vida como algo y empiezo a correr en círculos para que vaya subiendo la vida con el enemigo pegado a mis talones. Es eficaz pero muy ridículo.

No me quiero extender más, un juego muy divertido, un roguelike accesible pero exigente para los que estamos descubriendo este mundillo y todavía juegos como Caves of Qud o ToME se nos hacen un poco abstrusos.

Думаю, дело в следующем:

1. Сложнее въехать (чем в другие работы Shiro). Надо провести хотя бы часов 5-6. И сходу непонятны не только мелкие нюансы, а целые механики.

2. Это не римейк той самой Dune 2. Нет танков, ракетниц, выдуманных Ордосов и много чего ещё. Так уж получилось, что совершенно неканоническая разработка Westwood для многих игроков является первоисточником.

3. Это не особо похоже на Northgard. Вернее, совсем непохоже.

4. Это не RTS, а стратегия 4X. Может быть не такая навороченная как некоторые представители жанра. Но тут точно не работает никакой раш и типовые для RTS подходы.

А теперь то же самое, но с точки зрения плюсов:

1. Что такое 5-6 часов для 4X? Я в своё время в Civ5 въезжал дольше, а в Stellaris окончательно понял как играть через 30 часов. 5-6 часов - просто идеальное время для понимания стратегии такого типа.

2. Shiro гораздо бережнее поработали с книгами. И эта работа с ограничениями заставила их выверять подходы и особенности до мелочей.

3. Если честно, я Spice Wars полгода боялся запускать. Так как думал, что это рескин Northgard с некоторыми наворотами. Ура, это не он!

4. Кому-то вообще нужна была бы Dune 3000? Серьёзно? Жанр устарел ещё в начале 00-х.

А ещё! Здесь редко бывает больше 10-12 юнитов под контролем - и это заставляет включать голову. Общая медлительность позволяет воевать на 2, а иногда даже на 3 фронта. Есть активная пауза (для соло-игры). Дерево развития выверено до мелочей. Стороны сильно отличаются по фишкам. Графика, стиль и вообще UI в целом - идеал.

Короче, отличная игра. Одна из лучших стратегий, в которые я играл за последнее время. | Interesting to begin with.  The game plateaus very quickly though. Very little replayable value for me.  After a couple of hours it gets tedious.  Boring.  I regret buying this game. | The novel Dune was written during the Cold War, and this game has that aura.

Do not expect a standard RTS. This is a game about statecraft, about cold wars, about the balance of power, about paranoia. Warfare is a continuation of policy by other means- often an inevitable one, but more pursued to deny the enemy victory than to seize it. It's more about medieval-style raids & chevauchées than massive campaigns. The Landsraad and intelligence systems are brilliant. Expect assassinations to be a more common threat than sieges of enemy capitals are.

As an adaptation of the novel within the confines of a Civ-style game, it's excellent. The great dangers of Arrakis, the thirst & the worms, are of both strategic & tactical importance- by which I mean they will destroy your entire army if you slip up. So many of the little details of the world are here as well, down to the Fremen donkeys. The factions from the book are invoked wonderfully in gameplay too- the honor and ""honor"" of the Atreides, the drugged-up thuggery of the Harkonnen troops, the vicious, vampiric fanaticism of the Fremen, the Corrinos lurking aside, playing one House against another until they can throw down a fortress from orbit and seize the planet for themselves. The additional factions are flavorful too.

I'd recommend this game in particular to those who love the book & its cynical philosophy, and to those who like the idea of games like Civ but want something leaner, quicker, & smarter. 

Note that God created the single-player mode to train for the multiplayer mode. This review has assumed that it's the latter you'll be getting the game for. | Feels great. The environment is very dangerous but fair. Politics works, which is impressive for this kind of game. The factions have good differentiation- Harkonnens oppress their people and throw away their own people to feed the machine. Fremen move easily in the desert but they don't get to vote in politics. Atreides can be very effective politcally and can take villages peacefully. And whoever you are, there are the constant pressures of collecting the Spice. | Ce genre de jeux qui arrive à rendre simple une gestion complexe et multiple (économie, politique, militaire tactique et stratégique...)
Ayant découvert l'univers Dune depuis peu, je souhaitais trouver un jeu vidéo à la hauteur de celui-ci, me voilà tombé sur ce jeu réalisé par un studio français. Et c'est franchement une super bonne surprise, étant fan du genre, c'est vraiment du très bon boulot. La plupart des jeux de cette catégorie ont tendance à rapidement devenir des foutoirs incompréhensibles... Ici, c'est bien fait
Le jeu laisse vraiment la possibilité de gagner et de jouer comme on le souhaite, la faction qu'on veut également puisque pas mal de maisons sont jouables
Le côté aléatoire des évènements sont également pas mal pour assurer une bonne rejouabilité

Bref, je recommande",Dune: Spice Wars is a lot more fun than Northgard or Wartales.

Early on, it was great. We’re all veterans of [i]Terraria[/i]. In particular, I enjoyed the automation of gathering nodes and sending them along back to base.

But once you crack that initial outer wall open, oh boy, does it get grindy right quick.

You need ten whatsits to create the thingamajig that lets you scan for the boss. Fine, OK. But then you’re going to need 10 whozsamutsises to create the next boss scanning item, unless you want to explore the entirely-too-big map to find the boss on your own. So just adjust your playstyle and preferences accordingly, because you, son, are going to grind, and grind, and grind if you want to participate in this world.

I wasn’t having fun. I felt bad that I recommended this game to my friend group, and when I floated the idea that maybe we should move on to something less grindy, they basically said, “Oh, yeah, absolutely. We were only playing this because we thought you were really into it.” Admittedly, I was. At first.

The map needs to be smaller if this game is going for a boss-rush gameplay model. The grind needs to be lessened if you want people with lives and jobs to be interested.

It combines a campaign map with turn based battles. You can create your own civilization with its ruler and heroes, and play as the fantasy (or steam-punk) civilization you always wanted.

But I have some bigger issues with this game:

First off, since the last big update, the game has a tendency to crash on the campaign map. Which is really annoying, but dealbreaker for me is, that it also corrupts saves, so you cannot continue where it crashed. Especially annoying when you just fought a big battle and then lose all your progress.

Second is, that yes - you can create different civs - but in the end, they all play very similar. You always want to rush your city cap and just build as many armies as possible. Build wide, claim as much territory as possible. That's the strategy. The only difference is how your units look and what tomes you unlock. To be fair, some of the final tomes are very unique, but it takes a very long time till you get there and most of the game is already over by that point.

Third, the campaign map itself. You notice it is randomly generated. It's a combination of biomes with some features in it and some randomly placed ancient wonders. Every map looks similar. Sometimes it has more forest and sometimes more sand, but in the end, there are no ""unique"" landmarks or sights. After a few games, you have seen everything. Which would be okay, but one of the key points of this game is to go out and explore the map... which is just not interesting.

 | This game is absolutely fantastic! At first, I thought it would be a short and relaxing experience, but I was completely wrong (in a good way). There's a ton of content, and just when you think you've seen all the cool mechanics and design, the game surprises you again and again. It consistently keeps you on your toes.

That said, the sheer amount of content can feel a bit overwhelming at times.

Still, it's a must-buy if you're into this style of game! | Please support this game in Turkish language. Yes, the game is very, very nice, but without Turkish  language , l have no pleasure in playing the game. | Estupidamente incrível e a pura definição do que jogos são e deveriam ser nos dias de hoje.

Dave the Diver pode parecer repetitivo e sem conteúdo, mas é totalmente o contrário, toda vez que você pensa que não irá ter nada novo adiante, ele vai la e te entrega mais, bastante gameplay diferente durante o decorrer do jogo, cameos de outras franquias de jogos, referências e easter eggs magníficos.

Se você está a procura de um jogo que não seja caro e que entregue uma experiência completamente nova e empolgante, e também esteja cansado dessa geração genérica de AAAs, Dave the Diver foi feito pra você.

9,5/10 | Took a while for me to really get into it, but once I did, it was fantastic!

Pro's:
-Creativity
-It doesn't really get stale, because there is something new around every corner (a new game mechanic, a new area, a new part of the story)
-The humor
-it's fun to upgrade your restaurant, as well as your equipment. There is a good feeling of progression.
Because of that, things that are tricky at the start of the game, become much more doable, or even easy. And that's really great, because you feel that you've worked for it!
-The characters! Though it wouldn't have hurt if it had been a little bit less of a sausage fest. There are some female characters, but the main cast are male. Still, they were fun, memorable, and fit well into the story.
-The actual fishing! I loved coming across bigger, faster, stronger, more dangerous beasts of the sea, and besting them! It took a bit to really get the hang off, but once I did, it became so satisfying to dive every day and gather everything that I needed for the restaurant! Slowly unlocking and upgrading more dishes because I was able to catch different creatures. 
-Honestly, it just looks very nice! The colors are pleasant, the locations are pretty, the bosses are kinda cool, the character design is varied, I love that Dave is VERY much a plus size! He's just a lovable teddy bear. 


cons:
-There are some game mechanics that could have been left out? Especially at the end there are things that you need to keep up with that become more like a chore than something fun. But in my opinion, it's not terrible. You have the time, and it doesn't take that long, but still. It is a bit much to do everything.
-Dave in the water: Fantastic! Dave working in the restaurant.... incredibly slow. I know it's part of the game, but it is made worse when you have to poor drinks for customers.. Every time I had to pour a beer, or make a cocktail, I would dread it. And I had staff take over as quickly as I could.
-Some parts can be a little confusing at first, but once you get it, or get the hang of it, it's fine. It's mostly that there is a lot, and it can become overwhelming.


Would I recommend this game?
-To anyone that wants a semi-cozy (semi-stressful) gaming experience.
-If you like a roguelike, but would like a different take on it!
-You like fishies but arn't afraid to brutally shoot a harpoon into them (it's just a game. It's harsh but it's also comical. No actual fishies are harmed in you shooting a bunch of pixels. But people can be sensitive to stuff like this, and that's okay! Just keep this in mind before you buy!)
-You're ready to try something new!

So yes, in general I think this is a fantastic game! But it might not be for everyone (no game is) 
You can always watch some game play so you know what is ahead of you. If what you see seems fun, Go for it!!
If you are on the fence, I'd lean towards getting it anyway, because there is so much to this game, I'm sure there will be at least a few things that will positively surprise you if you are willing to put in the time!",Not recommended

Игра наполнена элементами исследования, повествованием и размышлениями о жизни, смерти, утрате и идентичности. Возможно она не всем подойдет и многие не поймут ее.

Субъективность восприятия игры - в игре осуществляется глубокая связь между игроком и рассказчиком. Все переживания, образы и слова передаются через личный опыт протагониста, что подчеркивает субъективный характер восприятия реальности. Это заставляет задуматься о том, насколько наши переживания формируют наше восприятие мира. Каждый игрок может по-разному интерпретировать события, исходя из своего жизненного опыта. Эта индивидуальность делает переживания в Dear Esther уникальными. В зависимости от личных ассоциаций, кто-то может акцентировать внимание на теме одиночества, тогда как другой игрок увидит в ней размышления о любви и утрате.

Поиск смысла основная задача, которую ставит перед собой герой - это поиск ответа на вопросы о жизни и смерти. Пребывание на заброшенном острове становится символом изоляции и размышлений о смысле жизни, что отражает философские концепции экзистенциализма и поиска идентичности. Размышления о существовании
Игра ставит перед игроком фундаментальные вопросы о существовании: ""Кто я?"", ""Почему я здесь?"" и ""Каковы мои связи с другими?"" Эти экзистенциалистские идеи пронизывают всю игру, побуждая игрока задуматься о своей жизни и своих выборах.

Замкнутый круг - игра исследует темы памяти и утраты, заставляя игрока испытывать горечь и ностальгию. Постепенное раскрытие истории через фрагменты воспоминаний приводит к глубоким размышлениям о том, как прошедшие события формируют наше настоящее и будущее. Концовка игры вызывает множество вопросов, оставляя игрокам пространство для личных выводов. Возможно, это отражает философскую концепцию цикла жизни и смерти, где каждый конец является также началом чего-то нового. Это подчеркивает идею о том, что понимание и принятие собственной истории и что это процесс, который продолжается бесконечно.

Изоляция и человеческие связи - остров, на котором происходит действие, символизирует физическую и эмоциональную изоляцию. Это позволяет игроку задуматься о своих собственных взаимодействиях и связях с другими людьми, а также о том, как одиночество может повлиять на личность.

Заключение

Dear Esther становится площадкой для размышлений о человечности, существовании и смысле. Она подчеркивает, что игры могут быть не только развлекательными, но и глубокими философскими произведениями, способными вызывать у игроков значимые переживания и размышления. Это просто гениальное сочетание искусства и интерактивности, способное затронуть самые потаенные уголки человеческой души.

И наберитесь терпения, в игре нету клавиши шифт :) | Admittedly emotionally compromised by this game, so bear with. I think the British coastline is one of the most consistently beautiful places I can lay eyes on, and have dedicated hundreds of hours of my time to walking around as much of it as I can. After my granddad on my Scottish side passed away, I accompanied my grieving father down the plots of land that meant the world to the both of them, and extended as far beyond as we could. One of our trips took us to Gometra, a place of such beauty it finally broke his stoic ass into tears, despite it not being somewhere he'd ever visited before. It's just such a haunted place, the whole coast is. Freezing cold, battering you with constant gales and rain and seafoam and seagull shit - the same elements that carve the land itself. Jagged slippery rocks and mundane flora, the only specs of colour or sign of human life being litter or debris, broken glass or empty cans left god knows how long ago. On my solo walks, my mind would wander to morbid places, imagining what would happen should I trip and hurt myself; what kinds of infections I'd get, how long it'd be if at all before I would have any chance of help.

That same uneasy awareness, the pull of the beautiful and the morbid, defines my experience with Dear Esther. The game's Hebridean island is made to feel like a place out of time, a frozen echo of someone's grief. It makes use of randomised props and narration, one of the major points of contention way back at this game's release. What does it all mean? Do you really need to replay it to get the full story? Even back when this was just a simple free Source mod developed as a university project, I somehow just Got It. I didn’t need to know who Donnelly was or why the narrator was here. The weight of it was enough, the way the words hung in the air like mist over the cliffs. Some things you don’t need to piece together; you just need to let the words hang as you eavesdrop on the memories on the breeze. Maybe this all works for me because - - embarrassingly, I think anyone who knows me particularly well would attest to this - - I am very emotionally vulnerable, not only to art but so many facets of life. If I am interpreting this as an existentialist tale about grief, would I be so greedy as to also demand Answers when life itself rarely supplies them at times of struggle? Much of why I feel this game be more effective than some of its more better-regarded peers is that it invites me to sit in the loneliness of the space. Pained, empty, but full - full of all the things unsaid, all the memories tied to a place that can’t speak for itself.
And maybe that’s why it hit me so hard. The randomisation of narration and props isn’t a gimmick; it’s a reminder that stories are never static. The same place, the same words, can mean something different depending on where you are in your life when you encounter them. I’ve played Dear Esther's original form, and the remaster a great many times, but this replay was a good few years in the making - and the story I uncovered felt wonderfully evocative... not because the island has changed, but because I have.

On replay I was particularly taken to the work put into the sound design. This is such a rich soundscape... The whisper of the wind through the grass, the distant crash of waves against the cliffs, the faint echo of something that could be a voice. Doesn’t just set the mood; it deepen it, pulling me further into the island’s strange, mournful embrace. Jessica Curry’s score remains as achingly beautiful as it was I first heard it, swelling at just the right moments to catch my breath in my throat, and using elements of unusual distortion and industrial wailing to convey a real sense of sorrow. It harkens to whenever I visit the coast - there's never a moment of silence, even in relative stillness and isolation, it's this overwhelming cacophony of nature is trying to crush the ground I'm standing on. Can't praise it enough, man, entire characters in some of my favourite games don't have the presence of the wind in Dear Esther.

One unsung aspect of this game for me is the involvement of Robert Briscoe - the veteran level designer for Mirror's Edge. That being a game I adore for its incredibly well thought out world - not just gameplay-wise, but mostly by how it conveys a sense of place. Mirror's Edge thrives on its pristine, dystopian cityscapes, where every building and rooftop feels deliberately placed to tell a story about control, surveillance, and rebellion. Briscoe’s work there demonstrated an ability to create environments that are more than just backdrops, they’re active participants in the narrative, conveying meaning through their design - on top of just looking gorgeous. This same philosophy is palpable in Dear Esther. A broken fence, a rusted piece of machinery, or a strange marking on the wall - each detail feels like a breadcrumb leading me further into the island’s mysteries. It’s also worth noting how Briscoe leveraged the Source engine to its fullest potential. The lighting, in particular, plays a huge role in the game’s emotional resonance. The way the sun sets over the cliffs or how the glow of phosphorescent caves contrasts with the bleakness above ground is breathtaking. These moments aren’t just pretty, they’re deeply atmospheric to me. The final chapter's skybox? Abso sublime.

The game isn't for everyone, and I understand why. I also don't think any game worth playing would be. The only interaction function is a camera zoom, there is one walk speed, if you don't feel for it then there's nothing to latch on to. Still, the smear back at release does feel incredibly quaint now that you can hardly walk through Itch without tripping over a game like this. It doesn't feel that way now, but this was an incredibly risky game at the time, and one that has definitely helped blossom a subgenre of narrative adventure game. You have to forgive me for the glaze sesh, it never really sat right with me that this game has been forbidden from getting its flowers even now. | Game doesn't lead player for achievements well as they busy with strong emotional relationships with related relatives based on phylosophy of life. Director messages on floor having no interaction i can't be 0 to 30 dk. On the other hand why would be strange spooky ghostly ominous sounds around dk. ps: cave was a big surprise and different kinda art with game was nice. | a beautiful walk through an impossible island as a man descends into madness | This is far from being just a ""walking simulator"" - this beautiful emotionally game it's so rich in everything that makes it this unique.","The game is a great experience, and the graphics are great."

Brotato is a very simple rougelite however what makes the game really fun is the many characters combined with the many weapons COMBINED with items and levels. Holy hell you get so much replay value. Not to mention harder difficulty modes to add more challenges. 

The gameplay loop is very simple yet the game knows this and doubles down. 
Honestly the price is a total steal but the game does go on sale.

I totally recommend the game :3

ふと思ったんですが、カードゲームの「ー（長音）」は、ひらがなとカタカナで表記が違うのかなと思ったんですが、そもそもひらがなに長音表記は無いのでした。だからひらがなで書くと「かあどげえむ」となっちゃうんですね。何とも気が抜けた文字ですね。

さて、開発元のSokpopは、２０１７年から現在まで、かれこれ１００タイトルを超えるゲームをリリースして来ました。知りませんでした。それも翻訳が必要だと思う様なゲームには大体日本語が対応してますし、複雑で不便な日本語を忠実に再現出来ていて、このSokpopという方々は何者なんだと思いまして、ホームページを見に行きましたところ、メンバー最年長のtijmenさんがバク転してました。爽やかで結構。

そのゲームタイトルの中でも一番売れているというこのStacklandsは、見ての通りのカードゲームですが、食料の概念が有りまして、村人が増えれば出来る作業が増えるけれども、食料が足りなくなるので、食料生産の自動化をして、やってるうちに敵が攻めて来て、ハンマーやつるはしを剣と盾に持ち替えて、戦って、死んで、やったー食料が減らないから一人でいいや、何だっけこの宝箱、何だミミックか、よし全滅。というゲームです。

Sokpopは他のゲームもワンアイデアが盛り込まれたちょっとイイじゃんっていう物が多い様に見えます。ホームページにPatreon.c0mへのリンクがデカデカと掲載されていましたので、飛んでみましたところ、４０００人以上の会員様がいらっしゃってこれだけで約６０００ドル／月という支援を受けており、その資金を使って更に毎月新しいゲームを開発して会員やSteamユーザーはニコニコ、開発者はバク転しているという好循環を生み出しています。

Unfortunately my review is negative because I tend to gather many resources, and the game becomes unmanageable when this happens, partially because the board size is smaller than the necessary, partially because new resources are not smartly grouped (they can be initially, but not for the long run). and then you start to focus more on the board management than the actual gameplay. My feeling is that the mechanic right now should be a beta version, and the true game should still be better polished before a true release. I do believe if the dev works in these improvements, the game may be a recommended one, but not right now.

La idea está divertida, tiene UN MONTÓN de combinaciones, busque una guía para verlas todas (ya que creía que era un logro pero no es así menos mal) 
El [u] Pixel Art [/u] está piola, no es feo para nada.

Básicamente vamos armando unidades con partes de no muertos y ""otros"". Conforme avanzamos y compramos ""mejoras"" al terminar la partida (como se debe el roguelike) podemos tener hasta 4 hechizos:
1- Curar un poco la vida de nuestras unidades
2.- Teletransportar algunas unidades (en un área seleccionada) de vuelta al castillo
3.- Soltar nuestro gatito para que tome recursos cercanos
4.- Una nube de ácido alrededor de nuestro castillo como defensa

[u] El Mapa [/u] es grande, me tomó más de media hora completarlo y conquistarlo todo mientras sobrevivo ya que sí, serás atacado ocasionalmente desde varias direcciones por distintos enemigos unos más fuertes que los más cercanos (desde tu comienzo, es decir, mientras más lejos más difícil y ""avanzados"" serán.
También hay algunas ""[u] mejoras [/u]"" o items esparcidos por el mapa que nos pueden ayudar [u] permanentemente [/u] si los encontramos.

Las cosas más ""negativas"" que hay son un poco la [u] jugabilidad [/u] , ya que es cierto como he visto otras opiniones aquí, reconfirmo que tus ""unidades"", su forma de actuar es: 
-tomar el recurso más cercano 
-atacar al enemigo más cercano 
-atacar la estructura más cercana.
Y puedes claro darles ordenes aunque son pocas:
-quedarse quieto o seguir explorando
-controlar 1 unidad manualmente, su movimiento con WASD
-matar (eliminar unidad)
-guardar (aquí no recuerdo si guardar el ""conjunto"" osea las combinaciones O la ""unidad"" entra al castillo. Creo que tiene sentido lo primero).
Bueno, [u] otra cosa negativa [/u] (y que creo que agregaron en la secuela) es la opción de ponerlos en ""modo defensa"" o ""patrulla"" ya que debido a su comportamiento anterior mencionado atacan a los enemigos cercanos y no ""defienden"" por ejemplo al castillo de los enemigos que lo atacan o terminan muy alejados del castillo y siguen explorando mientras me siguen atacando.

Bueno creo que eso es para mi el ""[u] mayor [/u]"" punto negativo que creo que corrigen en la secuela. Aún así me entretuve y pude completar el jueguito.

Quizás lo otro seria el organizar mejor las partes de cada especie para armar las unidades o de algún modo saber cuales combinaciones tenemos y cuales nos faltan.

Pero eso, fue entretenido el juego, aunque creo que seria mejor jugar la secuela directamente, ademas no me tomó tanto tiempo como esperaba este juego.

Espero jugar la secuela en un futuro. | meu olho esta ardendo de tanto q eu joguei este jogo, platinei em apenas duas gameplays de 5 horas, muito viciante! 10/10 vou agora jogar o 2. | A proposta do jogo é original e bem atrativa porém faltam alguns recursos para tornar a jogatina menos cansativa, como por exemplo alguma ferramenta para acelerar a passagem de tempo.

Being forced to play thru large levels where the end boss usually is something that summons 4 badgers with 84 health and 16 attack when your pulling a max of 32 atk...

Replayability good thing for a roguelite each run will be different due to the item, character and challenge you choose

Con
RNG dependant making some run at best boring at worst plain not fun | A couple of bugs still, with the major ones being: save files being deleted or keep loading at the same checkpoint over and over again like with my save file. Please don't put your hours in it like I did this weekend ;) The concept is good, a finished version 2.0 would be preferable. | I seriously went back and forth on this. There are aspects of this game that I [u]really[/u] like. The concept of sorting your backpack in a combative scenario and defeating enemies with strategic item placement is really great. The main character and the first unlockable character are fantastic fun*. However, there are numerable UI issues and item description issues that make learning how to play the game very unpleasant. Certain items are not straightforward and there seems to be no info online on how to use them or even what they are. This game is just over a year old and it's clear the Dev(s) care about this game as it receives regular updates. Yet for some reason, major game-breaking bugs still exist. 
So, I touched on the fun of this game. I want to make it clear that I mostly enjoyed playing this game. I have almost 50 hours in this game, I definitely have enjoyed it. But the learning curve of this game is steep. The way and pace at which things are unlocked are not well done, imo. I'm not sure what the intended method of play is, because there is no real info about that. The game throws you in the deep end, expecting you to figure out how to set up amazing engines of play. The quests give you great hints, don't get me wrong, but if you didn't think to do the quests (cus all the quests are optional) then wow. 

TLDR: There are many features of this game that I really enjoy. There are too many features of this game that I don't enjoy. Therefore, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to a new player unless they are willing to learn about this game before they play it. Fun game, but can be incredibly punishing. | The game use to be fun, but everything fun has been nerfed to the point it is boring.

The campaign progression is very slow and boring. the game mode does not even seem to add anything. Just a way to waste your time.

Quick play has such high item bloat that it is hard to get a build you want at all going. You can have multiple runs in a row without seeing a single structure, a bow and arrow, etc at all. But you will keep seeing a few of the same boring items you never want to appear every game.

Boss relics are just not fun anymore. They all have bad downsides and require specific builds to work. So you often do not even pick up a single boss relic. I think they were aiming for a slay the spire style boss relics without understanding them at all (the downsides were minor compared to the power given and STS did not try to balance things like this game).

So I guess this is a game that just changed from 1 8/10 game to a 3/10 for me.

Gameplay is turn based along a single axis, but there is a surprising amount of thought that you might have to put into each move. It's easy to get into and satisfying to play, especially when you unleash a multi tile combo clearing the whole screen. The starting kit for each character has enough tools to play through the game meaning that RNG is unlikely to ruin a run compared to other rougelikes.

I had great fun with this title for about 12 to 15 hours. Beyond that, getting past 'day 4' or 'day 5' difficulty got to be way too frustrating. Making even a single mistake often necessitates restart or outright loss. Getting bad tiles or upgrade statues means mistakes, and the item pool expands with further play. 

Some limited means of replaying a turn, like the turn reset from Into the Breach, might've helped.  But more importantly, the game demands you play each tier of difficulty with each character.

76561197970698176,2125420,Zorbus,5.0,"Indie, RPG",3,"After playing Civ 7 I was delighted to play a game where obvious attention and care went towards the interface.
Pleasant traditional roguelike with really nice interface+controls and a lot of DnD-esque flavor. Reminds me a bit of DCSS and Incursion. | dev:

maybe too late to add, but I really think a classic RPG interface with visual slots for weapons and so on would add so much to the game and let people instantly connect to it. (look at 'Caves of Qud' which just released last year and has an insanely well done UI for this now, even for characters with 4 arms or nearby floatables)

it feels like such an essential part of immersing yourself into the game... the lines of text may work as a nostalgia play, but scare off anyone who doesn't want to deal with a frankly incredibly clunky way of doing inventory and equipment.

I don't want to give it a bad rating, because the game essentially is exactly what it promises to be, but I simply can't enjoy games that force you to do min-maxy try-hard roguelike experience sans any fun, adventure, exploration and so on.
people already tend to min-max the fun out of games and if you force people into challenge modes that's all they're gonna do. 

if I could just save and reload, I could challenge myself, play more relaxed and not be annoyed when the only reason I died was because I didn't know that X -> bad idea.

I know that there are people that like that, a lot claim to like it, but very few in fact do.

what people do like is to play in this manner in a game they already mastered or understand really well. I play roguelike modes in games, or games with meta progression, i.e. rogueLITEs (capitalization for emphasis. it seems that term isn't used any more, but that's how people called it back then) 

a story mode, or normal RPG mode with just exploration and leveling and so on would have been amazing for this game.... 

I just wanna play *my* character, not do speedruns or no hit stuff or hardcore runs. this stuff is fun to watch others do, but it's just so boring to me because whenever I get attached to my character, I die. it just kills the game for me.

I can't criticize or downvote a game because it said ""roguelike"" and delivered that and I didn't enjoy it :D -- but if I played through in a normal save scum mode as most people do, I'd way way way more likely enjoy the roguelike experience.

if you only do a challenge mode game (which is what this essentially is), the best way to do these games is simply with heavy meta progression, but that is quite the headache in a genre like this, I suppose. how would you even scale this? I have no idea... but it would at least ""sell me"" on the idea that this is still ""my character"". restarting as the same character from 0 does not do that - for me at least.

you can always limit a game mode to be more challenging, or simply have several seemingly equal ways to play a game. limiting the ways you can play a game needlessly seems unwise, even if you yourself are purely interested in a roguelike experience.

the game's incredibly well executed. I like everything except that I can't shoot through people -- but that's kinda personal taste and I guess makes sense, but is a bit annoying when you play a ranged character with hirelings that constantly spawn in their pets and you barely get to fire an arrow.

. | This game's audio is really broken right now, the characters all sound like they are about half a mile down a tunnel or well, and it's even worse for the character you play as, you can;t hear them at all, just see the subtitles. I have looked everywhere, even dev blogs for a fix to this and there is no fixes found. It is definitely the game itself that has this game breaking bug as all other 250+ games I have on Steam do not have these kind of audio issues. I say game breaking bug, because, for me at least, half the fun of this game is the dialogue between all the characters. Fat Shark you need to fix this issue! I cannot and will not recommend this game right now as audio bugs can really affect how the gameplay runs, do yourself a favor and wait til you see a post saying they have fixed this issue. | I'd really love to upvote this game as it has been great co-operative multiplayer experience whenever it has worked properly. That is, the title bringing a breath of life into the Left 4 Dead genre with extensive character customization abilities. However, the game is let down by its horrible network code. More than half of the random games I've joined have ended up in some sort of desyncronization problems or outright disconnect without any specific reason or warning. Neither does any sort of game recovery from a disconnected host work either. Seven years after the release date the network play of the title is way too unreliable to really allow recommending the title.

My advice: if you are interested, buy the base game without any DLC if it's heavily discounted. If you enjoy it and find the network performance acceptable for your needs, so be it. In my case with the random games being irritating disconnect-a-fest I'm certainly not investing into all DLC's of the game even if they gave me considerable amount of new content to play with.",

I love the game but the weird middle-school ""drama"" and increasing friend levels (weird hangouts and trying to please people) was awkward. I'm all for cheesy comic book dialogue from the golden era but let's be real, I really wish it was darker in tone. It's ""dark"" in the sense that it has that late 90s-early 2000s edgy angst. It's like watching Blade but they took out the cursing and blood.

Let's be real, people were expecting Xcom with Marvel characters. Straight up, bringing in Marvel characters on a tactical map and playing a polished version of Freedom Force mixed with turn-based action and stellar graphics. It's definitely unique and works with what it's got, I almost wish it played like a rogue-lite. And dude, we should've gotten some more obscure characters but I know that doesn't pull in the masses.

That's it for my gripes. This game is addicting and we're kinda strapped for good superhero games, especially ones that let you control a squad of your favorites. Aside from the ""hub"" slowing down the action, I really love it. Graphics are slick, superheroes can feel powerful if you build the right deck, and though we still have the Avengers in it, it's not just about them and we get to play with characters who deserve a bit more spotlight. Despite what I feel about the tone of the story, I still think it's pretty solid for a superhero game. Throwing some goon into an explosion to wreck other badguys and then slamming down with some crazy AOE attack you've been saving your points for is insanely satisfying. Also, it has Ghost Rider. That was enough to make me buy it right there.

If you picked it up for PC, seriously look into modding as there are some tweaks out there that make the game feel more streamlined. | This game really took me by surprise. Its existence nearly passed me by when it launched in late 2022.

Little did I know: Firaxis Games and the XCOM team had just made a Marvel XCOM Mass Effect Card Battler.

WHAT?

I don't normally click with card battlers, and I am very burned out on superhero multimedia, but Midnight Suns quickly got its hooks in me, and I could not put it down. Maybe I'm just burned out on trash multimedia.

- If you like Marvel content, that's an easy reason to enjoy this. There's a good mix of superstar Avengers heroes and lesser known Midnight Suns heroes in the game.

- All of this game's DNA screams XCOM, the battles have just been converted to a smaller arena based around card battling, rather than a large cover and fog of war-based combat system. All of the management systems at play in your out of combat base, The Abbey, are very similar to XCOM headquarters. Train with your heroes, upgrade your cards, buy items, explore the Abbey grounds to find secrets and loot, and quite a bit more in-between combat missions.

- A friendship and hangout Social system with all of the heroes. Have some beers with Blade or go fishing with Wolverine, and you get battle bonuses for building these relationships, creating a great side progression system.

- I honestly don't play enough card battlers to give an expert gamer opinion on how deep the card strategy and deckbuilding is. But I started the game pretty inept, and by the end I was fine-tuning my hero decks, playing cards for a turn or two ahead, and optimizing my combat action sequences for maximum effect.

- The one DLC expansion that came out before development ended, The Good, The Bad, and the Undead, was just as high quality as the base game and integrated into it seamlessly. It was also amazing near the end when Morbius screamed ""ITS MORBIN' TIME""

- This has a LOT of dialogue, in a dialogue system that will be familiar if you've played the Mass Effect trilogy. The writing is never that good, in fact it can be quite comic book hammy at times, but this game is suitably epic. I accomplished a lot, but did NOT ""100%"" this game, and this was teetering on 90 hours played. That's bigger than the entire Mass Effect trilogy on completionist runs.

Some smaller criticisms of the game that I didn't love:

- They tried to go for a premium currency and loot grading system that just reeks in a single player game. Unacceptable. Alas, development of the game has ceased, and the Legendary Edition of this game includes ALL content.

- Some of the mission variety, particularly Story missions (move critical path/plot forward), left a bit to be desired. I never minded General missions (mostly side/optional missions) having recognisable presets, but to launch into Story missions and often have them padded out by the same presets as General missions was disappointing at times.

- Not a big fan of level scaling enemies, and the enemies in this game will do so until you reach max ""normal"" levels, after which there are ""heroic"" levels where you begin to eclipse them. This almost felt like an irrelevance to explain, but I was just shy of max level after finishing the game, so enemies scaled for my whole playthrough.

- That this game fell under the radar so hard, I never got more DLC expansions. We could have had Thor! And Squirrel Girl!

That's about it. I strongly recommend this game. If ""Marvel XCOM Mass Effect Card Battler"" speaks to you at all, you need to try this. | This game is the closest you can ever get to perfecting the formula of great companion characters.  The cast is the best part of this game, and anyone who says the Relationship building sucks doesn't know what they're talking about.  Each character is written both exactly as you'd expect, and with such a depth that it builds upon that legacy.  It's really fun to be able to leave your mark on the Marvel universe, and make friends and allies with some of the biggest names, cast in the best way.  

I originally wasn't into the Card Game idea, but I really came around to it.  It's really cool to play through them like combat puzzles, with plenty of opportunities for defenestration and environmental damage.  Each hero's card-set is so well designed that they all play a little different, allowing for strategic and flavorful combination.  I haven't played a Marvel game that utilized it's characters so well since Marvel Ultimate Alliance.  

The story is pretty good, but pretty much what you'd expect from a comic book event series.  Think about any of the comic events, these are the vibes.  Characters are transformed and die in interesting ways, that'll certainly be undone by some sort of cosmic force, it's kinda the name of the game here.  What it is, though, is a very fun thrill ride.  Lots of little twists and turns, and the level of dialogue choice can really make your experience *yours*.  

The DLC is pretty worth, I even enjoyed Deadpool, he wasn't annoying and had a really fun play style.  Game is super good, underrated even, especially from the X-Com devs.  Masters of the Strategy genre for sure, they can turn a silly card game gimmick into a really fun tactical puzzle game. 

TL;DR: You want a Marvel RPG with a fun Tactical Card Gimmick and solid representation across the Marvel Universe?  Get this game. | 是挺好玩的，依旧是漫威个人英雄主义风格，华丽的招式和特效，英雄出任务的动画以及剧情过程中的配乐非常不错，让人跟着激动。但是怪的种类较少和过多没有用的对话文本使游戏变得枯燥。尤其结局仓促的剧情让玩家的情感就像做爱一样还没达到高潮就匆匆结束了，和美剧一样虎头蛇尾。 | This game is so much better than you'd think it would be. I mean, it's way better than I thought it would be anyway. Such a unique take on tactics games by adding deck builder elements, and somehow it still feels like a marvel superhero game with it's mechanics.

This game goes on sale quite often for under $10.

There's also endless backtracking, and many quests you'll be under-leveled for (making them even more bullet-spongey) if you don't do all the side-quests.

Straftat remembers, and remembers well!

While the 1v1 nature of the game does take some general skill and wit, it is unpredictable enough for it to truly be anyone’s game most of the time. The rounds go by way too quickly to even think about getting frustrated. It’s mostly just that “Oh, dang. Nice one! You got me.” feeling and then it’s right on to the next round. My experience playing with randos online has been great! Everyone has been chill and there for a good time and I hope it's kept that way! 

Some of the maps are so unique and clever with their condensed structure and on-map arsenal that it gives me the same feeling I got from Halo 3’s custom games. You could be going down an infinitely sliding map one moment, to trying to push each other into landmines the next, to trying to spot each other in complete darkness the next, to naruto running through a jumping puzzle the next, to tossing grenades at each other in a labyrinth of doorways the next, and the next and the next and the next-

The game has bonus points for the aesthetic too! I’ve definitely fallen in love with the liminal tone of every map. Pairing that with the drum n bass music in the menus and the odd characters in suits, always with a cigarette in the mouth, makes the game almost feel like you’re in some sort of chill club of enthusiasts in the matrix or something. It’s a very specific vibe that I’m just drawn to. (Who would have thought Babbdi’s apparent violent societal collapse could be so fun to partake in!)

For a free game, it is miles and miles above expectation. I genuinely want people to buy the $5 DLC (which essentially doubles the content) just to support the devs. They’re doing truly fantastic work and deserve way more than they’ve been asking for! | This game is made with love.

不得不说，这个游戏算是最好玩的DRPG了，关卡设计相当出色，找隐藏找的很爽，大多数谜题设计的连贯、逻辑顺畅且富有挑战，小部分意义不明，比如有个隐藏需要把附近的一个火把拿下来，有个需要把笑脸雕像扔到门对面，完全没有提示的，有提示的像是扔3件装备开隐藏的字谜也难以理解，虽然可能翻译的古话占一部分原因，但我更倾向于对不上作者电波；

76561197970698176,2054970,Dragon's Dogma 2,0.8833333333333333,"Action, RPG",1,"After finishing it, I can conclude that Dragon's Dogma 2 might be the biggest disappointment I've ever experienced in gaming. I could go on for paragraphs about all the things that are bad about it, but I'll just summarize because I've already spent over 100 hours playing this when I could have been doing something else, like plucking my asshole hairs individually.

First and foremost, Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen exists. In a world where DDDA didn't exist, this game would stand about where DDDA was - blatantly unfinished, didn't live up to it's potential, lot's of contemplating on how it could be better, but essentially just the skeleton of something great with pretty decent gameplay. [i]However[/i].

DDDA exists. Not only does it exist, Dragon's Dogma 2 is a marked downgrade in nearly every single metric already established by the prior game twelve years ago. Eleven if you want to be generous for the addition of Dark Arisen. There is less enemy variety, there are less vocations, equipment variety is worse, the story is worse, there are both less major characters and they have infinitely less screen time/importance/value, the music is just... nothing. I could keep going. The only measure DD2 is a genuine improvement and not just a side grade is in the graphics department, and this comes at a cost of the game being complete dog ass to run on your average PC. Sure you'll probably get 30-60fps consistently but it will chug randomly for no reason all over the place. Ignore Capcom's nonsense about it being NPCs in town, I was getting 18fps just loading the model in my inventory. Something about REengine or Denuvo has this game in a complete stranglehold and unfortunately it'll probably never get fixed.

If DDDA didn't exist, Dragon's Dogma 2 would just be a kind of stupid action RPG with good gameplay. But instead it's an abysmal sequel to a game with an already kind of stupid plot with better gameplay, and it manages to take that original idea and basically photocopy it with a scanner that was pretty low on ink. This game is so frustratingly undercooked. Let's just use an example. 

In the original game, you took damage and you lost HP and your ""loss gauge"" increased. This missing HP couldn't be healed for free with Anodyne, so you could either go to an inn or use healing items. Healing items had weight and were limited, and though you'd eventually be swimming in them, the healing your loss gauge meant you wanted to have them just in case. In DD2, you take damage and your loss gauge builds up, and... healing items don't do anything different than Anodyne. Okay, so this immediately makes healing items fucking worthless since they're still making you heavier (and slower) but they do the same thing as Anodyne, which mages can cast for free, all the time. In fact you'd only not have a mage with anodyne because you specifically chose to have no mage in your party. In exchange, you now have to go camping. Camping is so... fucking... NOTHING. It's just completely devoid of anything. Find one of the spots all over the map, use your tent item which can break but not only will this basically never happen you find tents constantly - all so you can cook meat and get an actual video of someone grilling a steak on a pan in real life, and get a buff. You have the same one line of dialogue with your pawn at the camp site and go to sleep. But keep in mind you can only cook meat - not fish, not fruit, not potatoes, and you certainly can't make meals or anything fancy. In fact there are 8 types of meat you can cook for the entire game and they're all just variations of two types of meat, Scrag and Beast Steak. Combining them makes Dried whatever meat and if you let it rot you get Rotten whatever meat (which you can still cook and your pawns will say it's delicious because their canned yummy yummy response is also completely fucking nothing).

This is DD2. It's just so empty. It builds on nothing from DDDA. It's got a bigger world except it's almost exclusively just roads and cliffs that make traveling at night more annoying, and lots and lots of fighting fodder enemies. Which is fun! In fact, the first 20-30 hours of this game are spectacular. But the more you play it, the more and more obviously unfinished it is. Until the final sequence where the credits are rolling and some NPC I maybe met twice in 80 hours and don't care about is literally explaining to me what the Dragon's Dogma is. Holy shit.

I want to live in a world where this game never came out, because at least before I could hope about what Dragon's Dogma 2 could be. Now it's out, and it's too late. We'll never have that, just like we didn't get to have the Dragon's Dogma 1 that ""we were supposed to"".

At least I got to kill thousands of Goblins. Do not recommend. | Game hasnt been updated in months (sept) Really feels abandoned and needs optimizations badly.

2 - MONSTROS LIMITADOS, o combate do jogo é incrivel, mas n ajuda quando vc enfrenta o mesmo inimigo 50 mil vezes por minuto. A cada esquina q vc vira tem inimigo, vc n consegue explorar o mapa por 1 min ser atacado por uma das 50 variantes de goblins, poderiam ter usados alguns monstros de bitterblackisland, n sei pra que removeram a cockatrice por exemplo, era pra ter mais monstros, n menos. 
2.5 - MESMOS MONSTROS,  reutilizaram praticamente todos os monstros do outro jogo, os dragões são os mesmos, grifo o mesmo, tiraram a HIDRA pra por a MEDUSA que tem 2 golpes apenas, enfim, pouquissima variação, eu sei que é o mesmo universo, mas poderia ter bem mais monstros.
3 - NOTICEBOARD, n sei pra que removeram um dos sistemas legais que tinha no outro game, onde vc pegava quests num quadro e conseguia ganhar itens especiais e mais ouro, ganhar ouro nesse jogo é torturantemente dificil, por motivo nenhum.
4 - MAPA GIGANTESCO, mapa desnecessariamente grande, e fica ainda pior quando vc tem um sistema de fast travel limitado, monstros repetidos e uma FODENDO STAMINA limitadissima (Deus abençoes os moders, usem stamina ilimitada fora de combate, ninguém merece essa merda).
5 - SISTEMA DE RECOMPENSAS RUINS, vc quase n é recompensado por explorar o mapa, vc só acha porcarias em qualquer das cavernas que vc explora, todos os itens bons(armaduras,armas) vc consegue de vendedores, n tem incentivo pra vc explorar, n vai ter merda nenhuma pra vc adquirir nessas cavernas q vc n consiga melhor na vila mais próxima.
6 - SEM HARD MODE, era uma funcionalidade do outro jogo e removeram sei lá pq caralhos, os inimigos davam mais dano, mas vc conseguia adquirir as coisas bem mais rapido pois ganhava mais xp e ouro.
7 - NERF DE CLASSES, nerfaram algumas classes removendo a habilidade de usar 2 armas, STRIDER passou a ser ARCHER, podendo usar apenas o arco e é uma porcaria, dano é mediocre comparado ao primeiro jogo, só serve pra derrubar harpias essa merda, no primeiro vc podia usar 2 armas e o arco era mt foda(RANGER). Nerfaram umas magias de sorcerer também, meteoro foi cagado, tiraram diversas magias do jogo, incluindo as de gelo que tinha no outro q era lindo de ver(high gicel) e n colocaram nenhuma magia ""suprema"" nova, são as mesmas do outro jogo.
8 - PERFORMANCE, esse aqui deve ser puramente por culpa dessa merda de denuvo, minha máquina n é highend, mas n era pra rodar tão cagado, se vc conseguisse diminuir graficos pra rodar mais liso seria ótimo, mas n faz diferença nenhuma vc mexer nas config q o fps continua sempre a mesma bomba, sei lá diminuindo a população ou algo do tipo, de toda forma vai ter npc brotando na sua frente do nada ao entrar na cidade.
9- DEVS DOENTES, resumindo esse jogo é uma copia do outro jogo, tudo que tinha de ruim no outro ainda terá nesse, eles n fizeram questão de melhorar quase nada, e ainda nerfaram e removeram diversas coisas que eram legais no outro jogo.

BONUS: Se vc chegou até aqui tem algumas coisas boas nesse jogo, mas os defeitos minimizam. A quest da Sphinx é super divertida, combate sensacional, os graficos são bonitos, as classes são divertidas apesar de mt nerf, end game o pessoal fala que é a melhor parte do jogo, sistema de Pawns é mt divertido, da pra fazer mts combinações de party, eles são bem inteligentes, os minibosses são mt legais de enfrentar. | この作品ははっきり言って駄作です。前作より劣化しており、今後面白くなると思いません。理由は以下の通りです。

1、ストーリーと世界観

無印版からこの作品は所謂、最近の勇者魔王ものなのですが、魔王にあたるドラゴンは殆ど舞台装置で関わりがありません。
にも関わらずラストでさも関わり深いように振舞います。代わりによく出てくる界王も結局戦闘もなく、何がしたいかわかりません。
さらに気になるのはクエスト中悲劇的な最後を迎える事があってもクエストが終われば登場人物たちはまるで何もなかったかのように「やあ、どうしたんだい」と話します。まるで没入感がありません。

2、戦闘

特にひどいと感じるのがこの戦闘システムです。
まず、職業システムが無印からの完全劣化であり、擁護点はありません。というのも、例えば前作ではシーフとアーチャーは同時に使え両方の弱点を補え、爽快感のある戦闘ができました。しかし、今作ではアーチャーは回避ができず、シーフは遠距離攻撃ができないにも関わらずその代替となる要素もありません。アーチャーはゴブリンに袋叩きにあい、シーフはゴーレムのメダルを指をくわえてみているしかありません。
それに加えて相手からのダメージを受けた際のモーションが無駄に長く、長時間ハメられることも多々あります。
その対策としてとれるのは無敵技を連打し回避するか、高火力で押し切るかしかなく戦略幅はありません。
一応覚者という全職の武器が使える職がありますが、各職の奥義技が使えず技スロットが４つ中1つ使えず自由度はほぼありません。

3、謎のこだわり

この作品は他コメントでもあるように重量要素の追加、ファストトラベル要素の削減をしており、ストレス要素を意図的に増やしている作品です。それ自体が問題ではなく、上記ストレスフルな戦闘と坂で頻発する滑りなどが問題といえます。マップのつくりも甘く、製作者の意図と作品の完成度が見合っていない為ただのストレス要素でしかなくなっています。
ほかに、竜憑きという要素はＮＰＣを全滅させるというあまりにでかいデメリットがあるにも関わらず、メリットは１つたりともなく存在する意味が分かりません。
せめて竜憑き時に特殊戦闘があり、勝てば限定のポーン装備やスキルが手に入るようにするだけでここまでの不満は上がらなかったのではないでしょうか。

4，まとめ

無印が好きで、どうにかこのゲームが面白くならないかと考えたのですが、
1、ストーリー世界観はもうゲームを作り直すしかなく
2、戦闘システムも全職回避技追加や、怯みモーション短縮、ジャンプ力増加など根本から変えたほうがいいほど難点が多く
3、謎のこだわりを持つ製作者の意向から上記を見直すのは難しいでしょう

最後に、製作者はＧＴＡを参考にするのではなく、まずは近くにある無印とモンスターハンターを参考にしたほうがよかったのではないかと思います。 | 剧情是好的角色是好的战斗是好的
