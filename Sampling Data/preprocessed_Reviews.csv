ACE COMBAT™ 7: SKIES UNKNOWN,"Honestly? Just insane. I used to play Ace Combat games on the PS1, but I completely disconnected from it over the years. Now, on PC, I was able to finally reconnect with this amazing franchise through Skies Unknown, and I wish I did it sooner. Outstanding game, it delivers so much than I expected from a dogfighting game. A gigantic amount of varied aircrafts with outstanding modelling and style, tight exhilarating combat, the expert controls are just as I remember from Ace 3, the graphics are nice, although LOD could be better, story is very well written and character dub delivers both in EN and JP. I have basically nothing negative to say about this one, not a single technical issue, this is as competent as a game can be. I am itching to go back to revisit the my dear old Ace Combat 3 someday and relive those memories. I don't care about multiplayer, but the DLC missions are also great.","honestly? just insane. i used to play ace combat games on the ps1, but i completely disconnected from it over the years. now, on

Age of Fear 2: The Chaos Lord GOLD,"I bought this game in a bundle together with AoF 1 and 3. All the games share the same engine and the developer updates all of them frequently: this is important because it means that AoF 1 and 2 are not obsolete compared to AoF 3: they just have different campaigns. I needed about 20 hours to complete both campaigns (orcs and demons) at the expert level (the 2nd of 4): however I found the orc campaign a lot more difficult. Basically orcs haven't healing units and the “berserker” trait makes difficult to disengage from combat to drink an healing potion; moreover the ranged units are very weak, only the goblin assassins, unlocked in the second half of the campaign, are useful. I found the story a bit boring and uninspired: the story is not so important in this kind of game but if it is interesting and makes you curious then it motivates you to play on. Instead the demon campaign story was very nice: the dialogues between the heroes (a demon lady and a knight) are very funny and I was curious to discover the rest of it. The demon campaign is also a lot easier: basically the player can summon a lot of imps (ranged units) and use them as cannon fodder to weaken the enemies. These games are not masterpieces but they are traditional and solid strategy games: I am enjoying them (I am currently playing AoF 3...) and I absolutely recommend the bundle, especially if in sale.","i bought this game in a bundle together with aof 1 and 3. all the games share the same engine and the developer updates all of them frequently: this is important because it means that aof 1

Age of Wonders 4,"They removed racial traits in exchange for other customization options...but those options are mediocre and you only get 2 traits to start with.

Age of Wonders 4,"I want to love Age of Wonders 4. It has so many good bits. I love the customisation of the factions, the tomes of magic that are the development tree, the graphics are great, etc. etc. But that AI is so bad, and because it is so bad they have to stack the AI players with so many discounts and special costs, that it is a truly joyless affair beyond the first difficultly level. I'm fighting an AI empire with my army of like 5 stacks of 6 units, the most I can afford to pay upkeep on and keep developing. I defeat one full slightly bigger army of the AI, because it is awful tactically. Within two turns it has completely replenished that army, which I also defeat, but now my army is showing some wear. Two turns later...here comes another army of the same size. This just keeps happening. Tactically, the AI is dumb as a post, but I HAVE to play each of these battles tactically because if I use the ""auto-battle"" feature my general is just as dumb. So I end up playing multiple fairly dull tactical battles watching my army (which takes me a long time to replace) be eroded by the AI's stupid but countless forces. It ruins a sense that you are playing against an opponent that is vaguely similar to you. You are clearly playing as a human, and they are all weird and stupid computers who just can spam out armies 10 times faster than you can. I'm sure there are ways around this, I'm sure there are strategies I could be using to account for this, but I'm equally sure I would not find any of those strategies fun. It's a disappointment, I really was looking forward to this game and spent far more than I should have on getting it. I wish I had waited months for a sale. I'm 104 hours in (not much by 4X game standards) and I feel like I am done, it's just no fun to play against these dumb AI players. UPDATED: I'd heard that maybe they had fixed the AI somewhat. But nope, it still does exactly the same things it did before; spamming massive armies at a far greater rate than a human player with minimal intelligence. So disappointing, because there is so much that is well done in the game. Maybe I am missing something? I'm willing to be convinced I'm just playing wrong.","i want to love age of wonders 4. it has so many good bits. i love the customisation of the factions, the tomes of magic that are the development

Beholder,"Скажу честно, играть в Beholder мне ощутимо мешало чувство мерзости, я вырос в 80-е и был воспитан так, что доносчик обычно получал первым.

Первый признак болезненности государства, это принятие антиконституционных законов и наглое вмешательство в личную жизнь своих граждан. Управлять преступниками несоизмеримо проще, а если человек не совершает противоправных дел, то можно их выдумать. Абсурд ситуации, что это не наше будущее, а реальность. Большой брат уже не просто выбирает наш вектор развития, но и назидательно определяет группы лиц, делая их изгоями, в угоду политических амбиций. Мрачный тон повествования и силуэты персонажей наглядно демонстрирует, что это может случиться в любом обществе, и поэтому становится страшно.

Brawlhalla,"Совсем недавно мне посоветовали поиграть в игру Brawlhalla. Это 2d файтинг в мультиплеере. Основная задача этой игры скинуть противника с арены. Но для этого нужно попотеть, так как в этой игре набивается скилл, скилллвых игроков победить достаточно трудно. Наиграл я в эту игру совсем немного, но с уверенностью могу сказать что это шедевр. И так, начну более подробный рассказ об игре. В ней присутствует довольно неплохое количество персонажей, у которых имеется своё оружие и способности. Всего в игре их 38, но новых разработчики добавляют часто. Героев можно покупать за игровую валюту и за донат. Сама по себе игра бесплатная. Но на что жить разработчикам) Также в игре присутствует два режима игры. Обычный и ранговый, в котором можно получать деньги за которые надо покупать новое оружие. В обычных же боях, вы просто тренируетесь и также как и в ранговых получаете монеты, за которые покупаются новые герои. Присутствует система кланов, которая открывается с 15 уровня.

Call of Duty® (2003),"Definitely worth getting, lengthy campaign that includes USA, United Kingdoms and Russia storyline's that blend together well - decent amount of weapon options If you've enjoyed playing COD World at War, you'll have no problem getting into this game, most gun models and reload animations are exactly the same in both games, but very different story modes Good music also, definitely fitting the theme of ww2. Btw there is no censorship regarding nazi symbols, in fact it's shown everywhere in the game in most if not all missions, so if that's something that offends you you've been warned. But it's accurate with the history. The only downside to this game, are some technical difficulties. Launching the game doesn't work, unless I do Ctrl+alt+delete and start task manager, and force close Cod. Then the game will launch the second try, and that's a consistent fix for the problem.  The other technical issue, is after closing the game, steam still thinks the game is open adding fake hours to your playtime. And since steam thinks the game is still playing, I couldn't play other games without restarting my computer entirely, if I only restarted Steam it would still think I was playing COD. They were pretty small issues, pretty annoying, however they did have a consistent solution for the issues. besides that, I'd definitely recommend this game for anyone who enjoys world war 2 FPS

Call of Duty® (2003),"This is the original Game, the one that started all the fanboy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, dont get me wrong Call of Duty 1 was a great game. But loyalty means nothing to infinity ward.

Card Quest,"Fantastic deck-building game. As you clear areas you unlock items for 6 slots, each item adds a few cards or an ability you can use periodically. Each item is tied to one of the slots, and by mixing and matching you can heavily customize your deck. I found the game very hard until I realized that you need to play across the 3 different quests, not just focus on one. This allows you to clear the easy areas in all the quests to unlock more item options. One warning: while the art is good, you spend pretty much the whole game fighting enemy pictures on a black background. Outside of the theme of the cards/monsters and some quick text storytelling, you won't really see the world you're in. The combat mechanics and enemy design are tight and well crafted, you can dramatically change how your deck plays, and there's 4 characters with completely unique unlocks and playstyles. I've had a ton of fun with this game, and I'm definitely going to keep playing until I unlock everything.

Colt Canyon,"A real fun stylish western roguelite twin stick shooter.  You'll be running through the level looking for ammo and blasting baddies as you head down the road to rescue your kidnapped significant other.  There is a great variety in characters (primarily different stats and starting equipment), weapons, and baddies (including very tough bosses).  I find I really love/hate the game's tight ammo supply.  It keeps thing tense and often has you using non-optimal weapons as they might be the only ones you still have ammo for at the moment.  Also, since you can only carry 2 weapons at a time, the game really forces you to carefully weigh which ones you'll equip (and, nicely, as the game allows backtracking into previously cleared levels on a run, you're still free to switch back to any weapons you might have discarded earlier on the trail).","a real fun stylish western roguelite twin stick shooter.  you'll be running through the

Darksiders II Deathinitive Edition,"An excellent remaster that fixes what many users complained about when the original launched: HD textures, a different lighting engine (which may be subject to preference, as it is more realistic than before and thus things aren't as glowy anymore), DLC integrated into the main game, and plenty of fixes as well as rebalancing of enemies and gear. Honestly, this upgrade is worth it for the highly detailed textures and new environmental effects alone. If you've never played Darksiders II, this version is excellent for you, too. It includes all DLC content previously available and runs smooth on modern systems - even on my old (and hopefully soon to be replaced) AMD5750 graphics card, it runs just about the same as the original did, at a drastic increase in visual fidelity. Overall, I am very pleased. Finally the game looks like the artists intended it to originally, but weren't able to realize before.

Darksiders II Deathinitive Edition,"Sequel continues from first game’s story but you play as a different horseman (Death). However, this time you only do some fetch quests and bounty quests. Every character you see mocks Death or give him something to do for themselves. Since you know the story from the first game, you only learn about Death and his backstory which isn’t much. So, you will probably go into some dungeons and solve puzzles while doing platforms without caring about story. DLC campaigns only give you some short dungeons with same enemies out of the blue. There are some variety about platforming and puzzle aspect of the game but it is over-used. For that reason, that part feels like a chore after a while. Game is a bit more like an open world game and there some side quests in it. Although there isn’t much to do in this open world and side quest mostly collection quests; these quests are annoying even with a guide (there is no checklist in game for it). There is a new game+ option after finishing the game but I don’t know why someone would like to do that. First playthrough is pretty soulless and repetitive by itself already. What about combat though? It should be the most important part of the game, right? Unfortunately, no. There aren’t many combos or moves, combat is repetitive and there isn’t much of a variety of enemies, except the paint jobs of different enemies. Sadly, boss fights don’t compensate for these too and the Reaper form feels pretty weak. And most of the battles are against camera angles or bad viewpoints. Morever, locking into a big enemy doesn't help you at all. There are couple of skills to level up (not so much) and some gear to drop. Most of the gear you will find be useless and since money is mostly useless, selling them wouldn’t be useful either. By the way, there is no explanation about stats or weapons’ specials; so, good luck figuring them out by yourself. Lastly, bugs: Game is a huge bugfest. I encountered every kind of it; crash, visual, audio, unresponsive game, puzzles. Let me summarize them for you quickly: Game can crash sometimes and there is nothing you can do about it.  Other than that, graphics looks pixelated in modern systems while audio will partially disappear more you play or you change into additional campaigns. Sometimes your character won’t move if you press escape and you will be forced to restart the game. Additional campaigns have some broken puzzles; some may require you to restart, some will need a work around to solve it. As you can understand, this game is a mess and it is half finished (basically another AAA game). It isn’t worth the time you spent unless you are a huge fan of this genre or series.","sequel continues from first game’s story but you play as a different horseman (death). however, this time you

Yes the game is a sim about dealing drugs and out running the law. But the game feels like more then just that. The game has personality that I can almost compare to Postal and despite it looking like an asset flip I would call it an asset flip with character. For what I have been told there's no plans of adding combat to the game (which was advertised in the trailer) and I do feel a little mixed on that since it would add an extra layer to being a drug runner. One thing I would like added is an option to pass time like resting at home (to skip the police hours sometimes).

DungeonTop,"Good combat, excellent replay variance, many viable deck build options. If you're interested in this game I highly recommend it.

ENDLESS™ Space 2,"Endless Space 2 continues with the asymmetrical gameplay of Endless Legend to create a game with a great deal more replayability than Civilization, the game I think it is most similar to.  Every race has very different mechanics for things like how they colonize new worlds or how they use resources, and it results in feeling like you get 8 games in one.  Even better than Endless Legend, these different mechanics don't force you so much into a particular playstyle because once you've started you can do a lot tinkering with the race's government and techs to fit the play style you need for your situation.  This is why it is a better game than Civilization, in my opinion.  Because you have such control over what your alien race is and how they deal with the universe both among themselves and in interacting with the unknown. It possibly gets over complicated at time.  If you're just pressing end turn waiting for something to be built or a tech to be researched, you're probably missing out on a great deal of choice.  Your civilization includes your starting race and alien refugees who have settled on your worlds.  Shuffling the populations around between planets and later systems, and encouraging some to reproduce more rapidly is just some of the ways you can what your civilization is and how efficient it is.  But by the late game you have a quite a lot of worlds to manage and it can start to being a micromanagement chore. Diplomacy was quite simple when the game came out, but it has become a lot more complex recently.  I do think the AI doesn't know so well, what's in its best interest here.  It seems to undervalue systems and overvalue techs.  But it's a lot of fun wheeling and dealing and putting pressure and demanding tribute from lesser civilations, eventually to consume them through politics or conquest.  (I generally prefer the former.) The tech tree is much improved from the former title in the series.  But it doesn't seem to tell you all the information you'd like to know, especially in the military portion of the tree.  What will this gun actually mean to the fire power of my ships relative to what they are currently at, can they equip them, how much does it cost, are all questions that seem out of reach.  similarly, it would be nice to highlight techs that you can use easily.  such as, show me only techs that have to do with resources I have. Economy is interesting but another area that is poorly explained.  You can make a lot of money (dust in the game) by buying and selling luxury resources on the market and the game does tend to alert you when this is a good idea.  you can also set up trade routes which take a lot of time and resources and are a bit of a gamble because your trade ships can be easily destroyed often before they've paid for themselves.  I suppose it is more like commerce from the old days in that respect.  But here too, how much each trade you get earns for each trip is never told.  So, when you see the price increase for each new one go up, you have a hard deciding whether it is worth it.  Just in general this lack of specifics in places where there's no reason for it not to be is a problem. Which brings me to the final problem  there really needs to be an ingame almanac or manual.  There is an out of game manual, but it doesn't have specifics of how the systems work, either, and it is out of date, since quite a lot has been added to the game since launch.  I highly recommend Endless Space 2, but as a new player, you may not like it.  The game is all about preparation.  You have to have put some work into every aspect of managing your civilization before it you run into problems, so you can solve them before they arise, and it's nearly impossible to do that when some times you don't even know that the mechanics are in place to solve them in the first place.  I remember even just conducting a siege involved knowing about ground troops and upgrading them and man power and all kinds of info, that's hidden away on subscreens. You may even think you've research the proper tech, like tanks, but there's they are going to do no good for you if you don't know where to go to add the tanks to your armies or how to upgrade them and what would be a good proportion of tanks to infantry to bombers by seeing the positives and negatives of each one.  So, you will lose and have to restart the game and start planning earlier the next time.  and this will keep happening because after learning about sieges there will be something else like politics that screws you in the next game.  But eventually you'll start to get the picture and you'll realize this is the most detailed 4X game yet.","endless space 2 continues with the asymmetrical gameplay of endless legend to create a game with a great deal more replayability than civilization, the game i think it is most similar to.  every race has very different mechanics for things like how they colonize new worlds or how they use resources, and it results in feeling like you get 8 games in one.  even better than endless legend, these different mechanics don't force you so much into a particular playstyle because once you've started you can do a lot tinkering with the race's government and techs to fit the play style you need for your situation.  this is why it is a better game than civilization, in my opinion.  because you have such control over what your alien race is and how they deal with the universe both among themselves and in interacting with the unknown. it possibly gets over complicated at time.  if you're just pressing end turn waiting for something to be built or a tech to be researched, you're probably missing out on a great deal of choice.  your civilization includes your starting race and alien refugees who have settled on your worlds.  shuffling the populations around between planets and later systems, and encouraging some to reproduce more rapidly is just some of the ways you can what your civilization is and how efficient it is.  but by the late game you have a quite a lot of worlds to manage and it can start to being a micromanagement chore. diplomacy was quite simple when the game came out, but it has become a lot more complex recently.  i do think the ai doesn't know so well, what's in its best interest here.  it seems to undervalue systems and overvalue techs.  but it's a lot of fun wheeling and dealing and putting pressure and demanding tribute from lesser civilations, eventually to consume them through politics or conquest.

ENDLESS™ Space 2,"Quite a challenging game, although the diplomacy still needs a lot to improve, the game's system is better than the other 4X strategies, I think it's only competitor is Stellaris right now. A simple decision can change your entire outcome, a single research not made can mean battles won or lost.

ENDLESS™ Space 2,"The hype for Endless Space 2 was great before the release. This usualy brings some justified suspicion on the costumers side as many times in the past games that were eagerly expected turned out big flukes. But ES2 managed to avoid this pattern.

This is important as many devs and studios prefer to just release the sequels that seem and feel half finished and then try to catch up in DLC land.

Galaxy Squad,"Like a nice simple mix of X-COM and FTL. Not perfectly balanced and a little easy, but fun combat and overall a very nice game for a very fair price. You go from star to star having random encounters (mostly combat) while an invincible fleet closes out the galaxy behind you. The combat is very X-COM, turn based with abilities and cover and hit chance, enemies generally don't start acting until you get in their sight radius. I found the hardest difficulty to be pretty easy, and I imagine turn based veterans will find it the same. Combat is very fun, with a fantastic variety of enemies and a good variety of victory conditions. The player unit classes and abilities are fun to use as well, although some class/ship abilities are so good they seem almost mandatory. There's some replay value from the branching story, and unlocking more gear, classes, game modes, etc. It probably took me 40 hours to finish all the story variants and try all the game modes. If you use a guide or rush you could definitely get there faster than that. If you want an enjoyable fast-playing X-COM clone with a galaxy progression similar to FTL, and you don't mind the fact that it may not be very challenging, then I completely recommend this game at full price. I had a great time with it.","like a nice simple mix of x-com and ftl. not perfectly balanced and a little easy, but fun combat and overall a very nice game for a very fair price. you go from star to

Gloomhaven,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played in my life.

Gloomhaven,"I enjoy the innovative gameplay.  One of the game's biggest gimmicks is that each card has a top and bottom action, and during each turn you'll play 2 cards from your hand BUT must use different parts of the cards (i.e. you can't use 2 top or 2 bottom options).  This creates a lot of tension as you'll often have to essentially burn a card for a sub-standard option if you want to use a key option on the other card.  Cards played aren't completely lost, for the most part, but you'll be paying a high price to bring them back from the discard pile, so you can't really rely on getting favorite cards right back in your hand.","i enjoy the innovative gameplay.  one of the game's biggest gimmicks is that each card has a top and bottom action, and during each turn you'll play 2 cards from your hand but must use different parts of the cards (i.e. you can't use 2 top or 2 bottom options).  this creates a lot of tension as you'll often have to essentially burn a card for a sub-standard option if you want to use a key option on the other card.  cards played aren't completely lost, for the most part, but you'll be paying a high price to bring them back from the discard pile, so you can't really rely on getting favorite cards right back in your hand.",i enjoy the innovative gameplay  one of the games biggest gimmicks is that each card has a top and bottom action and during each turn youll play  cards from your hand but must use different parts of the cards ie you cant use  top or  bottom options  this creates a lot of tension as youll often have to essentially burn a card for a substandard option if you want to use a key option on the other card  cards played arent completely lost for the most part but youll be paying a high price to bring them back from the discard pile so you cant really rely on getting favorite cards right back in your hand,i enjoy the innovative gameplay one of the games biggest gimmicks is that each card has a top and bottom action and during each turn youll play cards from your hand but must use different parts of the cards ie you cant use top or bottom options this creates a lot of tension as youll often have to essentially burn a card for a substandard option if you want to use a key option on the other card cards played arent completely lost for the most part but youll be paying a high price to bring them back from the discard pile so you cant really rely on getting favorite cards right back in your hand,"['i', 'enjoy', 'the', 'innovative', 'gameplay', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'games', 'biggest', 'gimmicks', 'is', 'that', 'each', 'card', 'has', 'a', 'top', 'and', 'bottom', 'action', 'and', 'during', 'each', 'turn', 'youll', 'play', 'cards', 'from', 'your', 'hand', 'but', 'must', 'use', 'different', 'parts', 'of', 'the', 'cards', 'ie', 'you', 'cant', 'use', 'top', 'or', 'bottom', 'options', 'this', 'creates', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'tension', 'as', 'youll', 'often', 'have', 'to', 'essentially', 'burn', 'a', 'card', 'for', 'a', 'substandard', 'option', 'if', 'you', 'want', 'to', 'use', 'a', 'key', 'option', 'on', 'the', 'other', 'card', 'cards', 'played', 'arent', 'completely', 'lost', 'for', 'the', 'most', 'part', 'but', 'youll', 'be', 'paying', 'a', 'high', 'price', 'to', 'bring', 'them', 'back', 'from', 'the', 'discard', 'pile', 'so', 'you', 'cant', 'really', 'rely', 'on', 'getting', 'favorite', 'cards', 'right', 'back', 'in', 'your', 'hand']","['I', 'enjoy', 'the', 'innovative', 'gameplay', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'game', 'big', 'gimmick', 'be', 'that', 'each', 'card', 'have', 'a', 'top', 'and', 'bottom', 'action', 'and', 'during', 'each', 'turn', 'you', 'll', 'play', 'card', 'from', 'your', 'hand', 'but', 'must', 'use', 'different', 'part', 'of', 'the', 'card', 'ie', 'you', 'can', 'not', 'use', 'top', 'or', 'bottom', 'option', 'this', 'create', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'tension', 'as', 'you', 'll', 'often', 'have', 'to', 'essentially', 'burn', 'a', 'card', 'for', 'a', 'substandard', 'option', 'if', 'you', 'want', 'to', 'use', 'a', 'key', 'option', 'on', 'the', 'other', 'card', 'card', 'play', 'be', 'not', 'completely', 'lose', 'for', 'the', 'most', 'part', 'but', 'you', 'll', 'be', 'pay', 'a', 'high', 'price', 'to', 'bring', 'they', 'back', 'from', 'the', 'discard', 'pile', 'so', 'you', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'rely', 'on', 'get', 'favorite', 'card', 'right', 'back', 'in', 'your', 'hand']","['I', 'enjoy', 'innovative', 'gameplay', 'one', 'game', 'big', 'gimmick', 'card', 'top', 'bottom', 'action', 'turn', 'play', 'card', 'hand', 'must', 'use', 'different', 'part', 'card', 'ie', 'use', 'top', 'bottom', 'option', 'create', 'lot', 'tension', 'often', 'essentially', 'burn', 'card', 'substandard', 'option', 'want', 'use', 'key', 'option', 'card', 'card', 'play', 'completely', 'lose', 'part', 'pay', 'high', 'price', 'bring', 'back', 'discard', 'pile', 'really', 'rely', 'get', 'favorite', 'card', 'right', 'back', 'hand']",I enjoy innovative gameplay one game big gimmick card top bottom action turn play card hand must use different part card ie use top bottom option create lot tension often essentially burn card substandard option want use key option card card play completely lose part pay high price bring back discard pile really rely get favorite card right back hand

The new combat system was difficult for me to get the feel of at first.  it's much harder to block in this game than in the first one because if you have pressed attack before you pressed defend, your defend will not override it.  Essentially, you must wait until your attack animation is completed before you press your next button. I think it's good that it's different, because there was only ever skill required in the boss fights in the original game.  But it does have the effect of making the combat seem slow. I am surprised at how much I like this series.  The generic fantasy setting wouldn't appeal to me at all from a distance but once I'm actually playing it reminds me more of Lone Wolf or Conan than it does of Lord of the Rings, which is something to be thankful for, and often there is some inspiration in the creature designs.  My favorite has to be the mages from the first game with their spellbooks open and mounted to their armor.  Also, unlocking cards is so fun.  It lets you progress even when you fail the overall mission.  And that allows the game to be more difficult but not to frustrate the player.","the engaging mix of interesting choose your own adventures and deck building return in this sequel, and added to it are

Life is Strange - Episode 1,"The good: good storytelling, unique concept, nice soundtrack, makes you think about choices and the effect they have in real life. The bad: overly dramatic voice acting (especially from the lead character), hours of weepy teenage melodrama, some sections go on too long, the little choices don't matter, feels too cinematic for too long at times with many minutes of not interacting with the game at all. Overall Life is Strange is a good, if overrated, game. It has glaring faults, especially in the final episode, and I didn't quite get the emotional kick from it many others did. I found the characters incredibly whiney at times and the voice acting on the lead character to be overly emotional on everything. *In a shaky whispery voice choking up* ""yes... I'm, I'm going to take a high fibre dump now... then eat.. ba ba bacon and eggs"". I played the episodes all at once in a row, maybe this wouldn't have come across so annoying if I had played it as it was released originally. Some parts had me going, ""okay, I get it, it's all very weepy and sad, call a whambulance, can I play the game again now please?"" I give the game 6/10.

Life is Strange - Episode 1,"Dear god, talk about First World Problems the video game. This game has an interesting premise but so far, for me anyway, an 18 year old male who's finished high school, the execution so far leaves alot to be desired. I hadn't heard of this game until it came out, and I watched the trailers and thought  ""Hey, this looks kind of cool, it's like Brick mixed with Donnie Darko with a female protagonist"". It's more like Juno mixed with Donnie Darko at this point. Except without the pregnant main character. Essentially, you play as a female photography student in her late teens who discovers she has the abillity to reverse time. There are good characters in this game, and there are characters that appear to have some personality and actual problems, but so far the ""le wrong generation"" time traveling hipster you play as isn't one of them. Maybe that's the point and I just don't get this game. There hasn't been much plot so far, just alot of foreshadowing and character development. It's obvious that there is something not quite right going on here but we aren't told too much. That's not the problem. There's nothing wrong in having your plot take awhile to unravel. Introducing  your characters and your world through normal interraction and conversation (Well, normal considering you can find out what someone wants to hear and go back in time and tell them that), but it's not fun when every character has some kind of issue that's instantly apparent. There's the girl whos nudes have appeared online and shes bullied for it, the girl whos pregnant, the girl whos boyfriend is cheating on her, the girl whos step dad hits her. As said above, these people do have real issues. I'm not saying these people should just suck it up. What I'm saying is the writers shouldn't make every character you meet so miserable. Like I said, maybe this is because I'm an 18 year old male who doesn't go on tumblr and doesn't dress like someone from the 90s and I just don't ""get"" this game. But so far, to me anyway, it's a lot of wasted potentional. That said, there's still four more episodes to go, and I plan to play every one. Maybe it will get better. I'm hoping it does, because it's premise does still have me intrigued. [EDIT] I couldn't bring myself to play anymore of this game so I watched the rest of it on YouTube. It doesn't get better. At one point, your ""friend"" Chloe, probably the most irredeemable character in gaming history, murders a man and his dog in cold blood because she didn't want to pay him money that she owed him. It just keeps getting worse from there. Don't make my mistake, don't buy this ♥♥♥♥ game.","dear god, talk about first world problems the video game. this game has an interesting premise but so far, for me anyway, an 18 year old male who's finished high school, the execution so far leaves alot to be desired. i hadn't heard of this game until it came out, and i watched the trailers and thought  ""hey, this looks kind of cool, it's like brick mixed with donnie darko with a female protagonist"". it's more like juno mixed with donnie darko at this point. except without the pregnant main character. essentially, you play as a female photography student in her late teens who discovers she has the abillity to reverse time. there are good characters in this game, and there are characters that appear to have some personality and actual problems, but so far the ""le wrong generation"" time traveling hipster you play as isn't one of them. maybe that's the point and i just don't get this game. there hasn't been much plot so far, just alot of foreshadowing and character development. it's obvious that there is something not quite right going on here but we aren't told too much. that's not the problem. there's nothing wrong in having your plot take awhile to unravel. introducing  your characters and your world through normal interraction and conversation (well, normal considering you can find out what someone wants to hear and go back in time and tell them that), but it's not fun when every character has some kind of issue that's instantly apparent. there's the girl whos nudes have appeared online and shes bullied for it, the girl whos pregnant, the girl whos boyfriend is cheating on her, the girl whos step dad hits her. as said above, these people do have real issues. i'm not saying these people should just suck it up. what i'm saying is the writers shouldn't make every character you meet so miserable. like i said, maybe this is because i'm an 18 year old male who doesn't go on tumblr and doesn't dress like someone from the 90s and i just don't ""get"" this game. but so far, to me anyway, it's a lot of wasted potentional. that said, there's still four more episodes to go, and i plan to play every one. maybe it will get better. i'm hoping it does, because it's premise does still have me intrigued.

Life is Strange 2,"Warning for spoilers. Even though I loved the first two Life is Strange games this game was definitely not for me. I had a hard time finishing it and I procrastinated it for a long time (like a year). At first, I thought that I did not have the mindset but at the third chapter I realized that game was the problem. Writing is really bad and it is not remotely interesting. Characters are really shallow and most of them are really one sided. The little brother was really annoying and repulsive, and it felt like a chore to talk to him for the most of the time. Also, the side characters were much worse than him. Game constantly forces the certain people are racist narrative. Literally every single chapter has a racist right-wing antagonist with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stereotype (religious people, even with a church to burn down, multiple hillbillies, cops and border vigilantes at the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wall) except the third chapter which was the most playable chapter for me. The left-wing characters are the same. They are extreme and annoying for the most part. At last chapter there is a guy who says he left his kids and wife, after coming out as a gay man and blames the family for not being okay for being him gay (marrying a woman without even being attracted to hear, making multiple children, all being a lie). Weirdly, it is expected people to be okay with marrying someone without even being remotely attach to a person a start a family, then saying it is not good for me, leaving the family, starting a relationship with a man in a hippie lifestyle while it is being commented as being “brave”. Plus, there are some weird commentaries about “being a real patriot”, because there is a pride flag with American flag. Most of the “good guys” from the game sound like that unfortunately. Another example being a journalist which had rich parents and he lives on the road not being part of the family fortune, since they are cynical people, while researching nudist people. Sadly, they did not even try to create a decent character or story which brings us to the main point of the story: If there is a criminal activity and you are not white, you will go to the jail. Even the one of the endings supports this idea which makes absolutely no sense, there is no evidence for them to be charged. All of the endings are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ than next one and again do not make any sense. Other than that, the choices are really bad in this game. They do not matter and no impact on the story, since every chapter has some different forgettable character and still the game gives you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ options; like stealing, normalizing a mother who leaves two children (one of them is a baby), because she was “bored” (you are forced to make up with her) or running away from the cops for no reason. I felt the hate while I was playing the game but it was not about the racism against a minority group, it was hate against another group of people. Lastly, I do not know how the developers have the audacity to lecture other people openly with this kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ writing, especially being French and making a game about racism in USA while selling it worldwide. Talk about being hypocritical and looking down to people. Most of the people do not play games to be lectured, they play them to have a nice time and this game’s aim is certainly not it.","warning for spoilers. even though i loved the first two life is

openly with this kind of  writing especially being french and making a game about racism in usa while selling it worldwide talk about being hypocritical and looking down to people most of the people do not play games to be lectured they play them to have a nice time and this games aim is certainly not it,warning for spoilers even though i loved the first two life is strange games this game was definitely not for me i had a hard time finishing it and i procrastinated it for a long time like a year at first i thought that i did not have the mindset but at the third chapter i realized that game was the problem writing is really bad and it is not remotely interesting characters are really shallow and most of them are really one sided the little brother was really annoying and repulsive and it felt like a chore to talk to him for the most of the time also the side characters were much worse than him game constantly forces the certain people are racist narrative literally every single chapter has a racist rightwing antagonist with a stereotype religious people even with a church to burn down multiple hillbillies cops and border vigilantes at the wall except the third chapter which was the most playable chapter for me the leftwing characters are the same they are extreme and annoying for the most part at last chapter there is a guy who says he left his kids and wife after coming out as a gay man and blames the family for not being okay for being him gay marrying a woman without even being attracted to hear making multiple children all being a lie weirdly it is expected people to be okay with marrying someone without even being remotely attach to a person a start a family then saying it is not good for me leaving the family starting a relationship with a man in a hippie lifestyle while it is being commented as being brave plus there are some weird commentaries about being a real patriot because there is a pride flag with american flag most of the good guys from the game sound like that unfortunately another example being a journalist which had rich parents and he lives on the road not being part of the family fortune since they are cynical people while researching nudist people sadly they did not even try to create a decent character or story which brings us to the main point of the story if there is a criminal activity and you are not white you will go to the jail even the one of the endings supports this idea which makes absolutely no sense there is no evidence for them to be charged all of the endings are than next one and again do not make any sense other than that the choices are really bad in this game they do not matter and no impact on the story since every chapter has some different forgettable character and still the game gives you options like stealing normalizing a mother who leaves two children one of them is a baby because she was bored you are forced to make up with her or running away from the cops for no reason

Need for Speed™ Rivals,"I feel the need, the need to drive around town. --what is it?-- It's a driving game, in a arcade style. You get to choose from 3 different objectives to complete during a race, that suits your style. When you complete the objectives, you unlock the next race and then keep on doing that again, pick a objective, have a race, and get some points to buy cars. You can choose to be the cops or not cops. You get some additional helpful items that can benefit you in a race, such as boosters or spike strips. I was put off by the brownish colour tint the game seems to have for a while. As time went on, it was less noticable and it looked better and better the more cars I unlocked. But there is a serious lack of colour that originally was a eyesore. The car models are stunning. The cars handle a lot with the feeling that it's on rails, and if you are used to a more modern Need for speed title, it will feel like you are stuck on the road like glue. Mainly it has to do with the fact that the roads tend to only go one way. You get a weird feeling that you are stuck on a highway. There's never any areas to stop, with crossroads, alleys or traffic lights, or a place to turn into any other street that's connected to it. The whole map is all essentially one big loop. In addition to that the camera I think, that's not as flexible as the newer racing games The car handling does have it's own feel to it, that is very arcade like and the cars feel very heavy. It does take some getting used to, and once I completed it, was really enjoying it thoroughly, mainly because the handling improved drastically with the cars that you get to drive later on. There are a few other major negative points, in that you can't pause the game. Also the keyboard default controls were strange, and worst of all the refresh rate was stuck on 30fps, which felt borderline unplayable. Once that was fixed with a command line that didn't work for me in Steam command line, but once I added it in Origins command line it worked from there. Everything felt so much better, and I could finally enjoy the game.","i feel the need, the need to drive around town. --what is it?-- it's a driving game, in a arcade style. you get to choose from 3

OUTRIDERS,"Buggy and unoptimized even now, but if you can deal with it or happen to be one of the few lucky ones that doesn't encounter these issues then there is a lot of fun to be had here. Great/satisfying gore, fun Gears of War like game play, decent graphics, and the characters/story have that dark and rough/tough look and vibe that the old GoW trilogy story and characters had. Definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of GoW and 3rd person shooters, though I highly suggest playing it coop and having the difficulty scale with your characters or it will probably be too easy, makes it much more fun. The only cons I personally had were ofcourse the bugs/optimization, sometimes the game play can get a little repetitive after a while, and finally I felt like you got way too much loot. This final con was especially annoying if you're playing on the highest difficulty that scales with you because you are almost constantly getting better gear which really takes away from the excitement you get when you have just found some really good loot. I felt like I was always switching out my weapons and armor because I was almost constantly getting something better.

Outer Wilds,"Wow, what a game.   You really need above average intelligence to figure this game out without hints.   The dev team must really have been really smart to figure out how to put together such a game.   They did a great job.   The cartoony characters threw me off, thinking it was more of a young person's game but it takes a lot of mature logic to figure out what was going on.   I can tell the dev team really enjoy space and physics because it relies heavily upon these.   It did take me awhile to bond with the game (about 15 hours).  It was ok at first and I kept going based on all the outstanding reviews.   It was enjoyable enough to get to that point but didn't hook me in until then.   It definitely had it's frustrating moments; but then again, all games usually do.    I would definitely recommend this ride.   Reading about the game just doesn't give you a great feel of what it is all about and just has to be experienced.   Did it change my life.  No.  But I definitely enjoyed the ride.

Outer Wilds,"Amazing and pretty unique game. There is basically no progression in the normal sense, it is all about learning about how the universe works. Very engaging premise and very well designed. Does some incredible things with exploration and non-linear narrative. My primary complaints are that it can get a bit repetitive and/or frustrating at times doing the same stuff over and over or just barely missing something and having to wait ~22 minutes to do it again. Also, the ""solution"" to the game is a bit underwhelming compared to what it could have been. Plus, I kind of wish there was one or two more planets and/or environments to explore as well. Besides those small issues, the game is incredible. It is a bit expensive at full price, so I might suggest waiting for it to go on sale (like $15 or less), but as it stands I really loved it and highly recommend it for those who love exploration games and experimental games. 8.5/10 With the expansion the game becomes more complete and fleshed out. 9/10 with the expansion.","amazing and pretty unique game. there is basically no progression in the

Police Stories,"Really fun top-down tactical game. Worked well co-op via Remote Play Together. Took 4 hours to beat on Easy. Started out really hard but got a lot easier after a couple missions (unlocked gear), probably could have stepped up the difficulty but we were still enjoying it on easy. Enemies' aim is near perfect and your guns have a scatter which gives you almost no time to react, really forces you to be tactical and use your gear. Feels satisfying to get through a level without making a mistake. Story is kinda meh but the gameplay doesn't need it. There's workshop support, haven't tried it but there's a lot of missions out there, might provide some extra play time for some players.

Police Stories,"This a short nostalgic game with retro graphics and 2D playstyle. Graphics are pretty cute and animations are coherent with that. Even though music is a bit limited, it is good and it is compatible with the noir/80’s action movie style. As you can understand from the style of the game, story is non-original and it is there only for atmospheric reasons. So, if you do not expect nothing from it, it is not bad. The main part that the game shines is the playstyle. Even though, it is a bit limited and weird at the beginning, as you unlock more equipment, gameplay gets better and you are able to play without killing anyone. However, without the equipment, there is no way for a peaceful playthrough (like real life I guess). Some of the equipment are pretty useless but if you think the length of the story mode, it has a decent variety of equipment. I prefer mostly singleplayer; so, I did not look into co-op no more than one mission and I can say that I had no problem with it. However, I can’t see a real reason to play this game with another person. I feel like, it would make it harder to get As in the missions. AI serves well as an additional equipment pack. Other than that, with the last update you can design your own levels and play other people’s levels if you are into that. I am not into that but I appreciate having it.","this a short nostalgic game with retro graphics and 2d playstyle. graphics are pretty cute and animations are coherent with that. even though music is

Ready or Not,"Good game, but not as ""realistic"" as the devs claim. SWAT 4 presented more realistic scenarios, the most guys you'd have to fight would be like 5 dudes.  In Ready or Not, you are routinely caught in wall to wall fire fights from all angles by like 50 guys, who are usually just security guards, not armed criminals. (Security guard would probably not fight the police) My main complaint is that as great as this game is, it comes off as total cop porn, depicting SWAT teams as gun-ho action heroes instead of the reality of what the job entails. This is closer to Rainbow Six than the original SWAT. Not really a bad thing, but I feel like it does take something away from the experience. You don't get to pick your entry point, there are no police snipers and as I said, the amount of hostiles is far beyond anything a SWAT team would be called to put down. Ready or Not also doesn't ask the same questions that SWAT does, about proper police procedure. For example, many of the arrest animations, most of which you perform on non-suspects and hostages, might be considered police brutality. (Slapping the person and shoving them to the ground. Not exactly the best way to treat someone whos been taken hostage.) This would be fine, but the game never uses this to make a statement. It just presents it as accepted procedure. SWAT 4 was very nuanced about this sort of thing in a way that these developers don't seem to be. I mean, they are banning people on the forums for making jokes about the ATF or people who mention George Floyd, even in jest. Just reeks of insecurity and an unquestioning obedience to authority. However, where I think the game shines is its atmosphere and the gritty environments. The enemies are some seriously bad people. Not just your usual gang bangers, bank robbers and terrorists. You'll raid sex slave rings, child traffickers, and a crackhouse complete with an ODing baby. Some seriously nasty stuff that borders on horror. Its incredibly violent, which is another plus. On at least one level, a suspect blows his head off rather than be taken down. The Nightclub shooting is filled with gory bodies and the mansion raid has some incredibly confronting scenes involving child murder. Definitely not a game for the faint of heart, but in this sense, I think it does depict the nature of inhumanity that humans often display to each other.","good game, but not as ""realistic"" as the devs claim. swat 4 presented more realistic scenarios, the most guys you'd have to fight would be like 5 dudes.  in ready or not, you are routinely caught in wall to wall fire fights from all angles by like 50 guys, who are usually just security guards, not armed criminals.

swat team would be called to put down ready or not also doesnt ask the same questions that swat does about proper police procedure for example many of the arrest animations most of which you perform on nonsuspects and hostages might be considered police brutality slapping the person and shoving them to the ground not exactly the best way to treat someone whos been taken hostage this would be fine but the game never uses this to make a statement it just presents it as accepted procedure swat was very nuanced about this sort of thing in a way that these developers dont seem to be i mean they are banning people on the forums for making jokes about the atf or people who mention george floyd even in jest just reeks of insecurity and an unquestioning obedience to authority however where i think the game shines is its atmosphere and the gritty environments the enemies are some seriously bad people not just your usual gang bangers bank robbers and terrorists youll raid sex slave rings child traffickers and a crackhouse complete with an oding baby some seriously nasty stuff that borders on horror its incredibly violent which is another plus on at least one level a suspect blows his head off rather than be taken down the nightclub shooting is filled with gory bodies and the mansion raid has some incredibly confronting scenes involving child murder definitely not a game for the faint of heart but in this sense i think it does depict the nature of inhumanity that humans often display to each other,"['good', 'game', 'but', 'not', 'as', 'realistic', 'as', 'the', 'devs', 'claim',

Rebel Cops,"This a turn-based tactical game with resource management mechanics. It looks like developers wanted to follow a more populistic way after This is the Police. There isn’t any strong aspect of This is the Police franchise unfortunately. There isn’t a real story, soundtrack is repetitive, tactical combat is limited, levelling is weak and resource management is just there to be there. First of all, the story, it is overtly not the main aspect of the game. It is just there, because it needs to be. It is for providing a concept but even with that it is bad. You are in a really small town with a huge crime ring. There are hundreds of people in this mob weirdly. You can’t grasp why are you working with a known dirty cop, even though you have an evidence against him. However, Warren Nash helps you until the end. Secondly, repetition. There isn’t any variety in soundtrack and there aren’t many tracks either. Unfortunately, biggest negative part about the game is limited and repetitive gameplay. Every mechanical aspect of the game is stretched. There are only two different types of enemies, less than ten skills and three attributes. Because of these limited gameplay features, you can’t do anything different playing the game. Other than that, there is a resource management part of the game which feels forced. As a vigilante you shouldn’t have a budget and an arsenal to fight the crime, I agree with that part but while you can loot the missions for TVs, PCs or video cassettes you can’t loot the criminals for their weapons or ammo. That is just plain non-sense. Stealth isn’t such a good option either. It doesn’t reward the player catching criminals instead of killing them – there is the advantage of not using the ammo though – and shooting strategy is easier (thanks to charging AI). On the bright side, there is some variety for the missions and there isn’t much games in this category. So, if you like games likes XCOM or UFO series which don’t have a strong story you may like this game. Plus, there wasn’t any bug and the price is pretty reasonable.","this a turn-based tactical game with resource management mechanics. it looks like developers wanted to follow a more populistic way

biggest negative part about the game is limited and repetitive gameplay. every mechanical aspect of the game is stretched. there are only two different types of enemies, less than ten skills and three attributes. because of these limited gameplay features, you can’t do anything different playing the game. other than that, there is a resource management part of the game which feels forced. as a vigilante you shouldn’t have a budget and an arsenal to fight the crime, i agree with that part but while you can loot the missions for tvs, pcs or video cassettes you can’t loot the criminals for their weapons or ammo. that is just plain non-sense. stealth isn’t such a good option either. it doesn’t reward the player catching criminals instead of killing them – there is the advantage of not using the ammo though – and shooting strategy is easier (thanks to charging ai). on the bright side, there is some variety for the missions and there isn’t much games in this category. so, if you like games likes xcom or ufo series which don’t have a strong story you may like this game. plus, there wasn’t any bug and the price is pretty reasonable.",this a turnbased tactical game with resource

Remnant: From the Ashes,"This game has some serious problems, enough that I do not find it worth playing. It's buggy - untargetable enemies under the floor will kill you, flying enemies will clip into bridges/etc. and will shoot you while you can't hit them. In a game where a few hits will kill you, taking damage from bugged out enemies you can't hit is unacceptable. Its combat is poorly designed. Enemies will charge at you while out of line of sight and their charges will wrap around 90 degree angle corners. Melee swings will hit you even when you're on the other side of pillars. Bosses will enter their phases inconsistently - a boss that summons allies at 80% health one run and 40% the next can be either very hard or relatively easy based on pure luck. The main combat loop is extremely boring. The enemies felt very samey, mainly because they all require the same approach. Most of the bosses I fought had the same problem - keep your distance, plink away at the health bar, definitive bullet sponges. Level design felt like 3 areas on copy/paste, without the minimap I would have thought I'd gone in circles. Character abilities were simple, not requiring timing, aiming, or thinking. Character progression is terrible as well. Weapons unlock slowly and are basic standard gun types. Everything upgrades in zero-effort linear fashion - leveled up stats and weapons simply improve incrementally. Enemies level to match your highest gear so you get punished if you try to specialize. The game offers zero interesting decisions. Add to that the basic problems with souls-like and third person combat -- focusing on dodge timing is your only combat option, your character blocks your view in tight hallways, bullets hit object corners that your aim reticle looks clear around, etc. -- and I found the frustrations to far outweigh any entertainment value. The game is a bunch of poorly built parts cobbled into a fumbling whole. I don't understand the positive reception it has received.","this game has some serious problems, enough that i do not find it worth playing. it's buggy - untargetable enemies under the floor will

Serious Sam 2,"I want to start by saying I don't think this is a bad game, it's just a 'meh' one, and feels like the weakest out of the main series with the possible exception of 4 since I haven't played it. I would still recommend people who miss chaotic 90s shooters to check out the series as a whole. Serious Sam 2 leans into a lot more into the comedy than the prior games, and that's the main aspect that dates this game. It feels like it was written by children at times. And while there is the occasional funny scene, many of the jokes fall completely flat. Not to mention the character design of every NPC that isn't Sam is...bizarre. That being said this is more Serious Sam, so if you liked the other games it'll feel right at home. They even added in dual wielding of any combination of weapons (although you have to look up what button does it since the game does not tell you and I discovered the feature by accident) resulting in a lot of fun. But it can be frustrating that your weapons reset and the end of every world and sometimes it can take ages to get anything better than the double barrel shotgun. It's a great gun and all but Serious Sam always felt really fun in its chaotic need to jump from gun to gun depending on the situation.  This problem is heavily amplified on the final world, where 4 out of the 7 levels reset your weapons. They also patched in a gun that got cut from the original release, but it only appears in the second world, never to be seen again. I will say to its credit that the final level is the craziest I've played in the franchise so far, where its pretty much a nonstop 40 minute barrage of absolutely everything being thrown at you. Most of the other levels are about 8-15 minutes long. Maybe Im being a bit harsh on the humor though, yet finding giant piles of poo and two of the villagers boning in a outhouse, or all of the npc's having wacky, high pitches voices just isn't my cup of tea.","i want to start by saying i don't think this is a bad game, it's just a 'meh' one, and feels like the weakest out of the main series with the possible exception of 4 since i haven't played it.

Terminator: Resistance,"Not bad, but not great either and not worth paying full price imo. I paid $20, but honestly it was more of a sub $15 sale price game for me. I think big fans of the series could enjoy it more however. My score: 2.5/5 - Enemies feel a bit too spongy sometimes when played on hard difficulty (medium was too easy for me personally). - Levels were ok. Many of them honestly felt bland and similar looking after a while. - Graphics weren't bad, but the character models and animations weren't very good. - Performance was smooth and I consistently got 80+ fps throughout the game. - Experienced one crash towards the end of the game and had one bug where a character who was needed to proceed to the next area of the game got caught behind some geometry. I didn't realize this till later in the mission and so I had to load 3 checkpoints back and do that portion all over again.

Terminator: Resistance,A fun ride.   You get more powerful as you go.  A linear game with side missions which are optional.  These side missions will still be in the same map so if you go further or in a different direction you may get something a character is asking for or you can destroy a skynet base for xp.  It has level up trees.  It has nicked a couple  elements of fallout like the way it zooms in to character faces when dialoging and the lockpick is just like fallout.    It has a nice ending battle that makes the slow pace of the rest of the game worth it to me.      They did a good job of tying into the first two movies at the end.  The infiltrator DLC was really sweet.   Clearing bunkers as a terminator.  They did a great job on what I would expect the humans to do when breached such as talking to themselves and freaking out that they are going to die.   I would give this game a 7.5/10.

The Banner Saga 3,"Even though I loved the first two games, this game wasn’t really enjoyable for me. Sadly, it feels like a half-finished work. A lot of characters’ stories remain unfinished, while the ending is rushed and not satisfactory at all (cutscene is really short). Developers seem to forget the substories, like the ending of the second game (Bolverk, horsemen, king, etc.). Also, there is a huge questionable game design choice. The game shortens as much as you played the game well, you see less content if you do not make mistakes or less mistakes. Still, the game is pretty short but it is actually a good thing. Because I was relieved that I was able to finish the game. The main reason for that is the constant crashes. Unfortunately, the game is not stable enough and there is no save option other than the autosave. Therefore, you will lose a lot of progress, especially with the wave system. Long battles were not enjoyable before and now with the wave system, it is worse. Crashes make the risky wave system riskier, since it is a huge gamble and the waves do not give a huge reward, while you are forced to finish the combat in quicker manner which was not enjoyable for me. Gameplay does not add very much other than a few new enemies with witch class and dredge playable characters. Levelling brings the title system which are passive abilities. Similar levelling system was present at the second game and it did not feel very well as a progress accomplishment feeling. Training system and camp management are gone and dialogues are much less with boring choices. Also, the achievement renown award system (you get 5 renown when you unlock an achievement for one time only) continues and it is more annoying with crashes. I have lost 15-20 renown, just because of crashes. If you are going to purchase this game (at least, it is not expensive), do not expect too much and be mindful, if you are an achievement hunter, since one of the achievements is not doable anymore.","even though i loved the first two games, this game wasn’t really enjoyable for me. sadly, it feels like a half-finished work. a lot of characters’ stories remain unfinished, while the

Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales,"This one is another in-between game for me. Art style is pretty good, writing is decent but story is a bit mediocre. Sadly, deck building and trying new card combinations aren’t a big part of the game. There aren’t much variety there and most of the enemies use the same cards. Only some of the boss battles are different. And there are puzzle battles (a lot of them). They offer different battles but they are not so great. I didn’t hate them and I think they give a different feeling to the game but a lot of people are annoyed by those battles. Actually, those puzzles gave me strength to finish the game. Still, it doesn’t change that they aren’t good. Other than that, there is the Witcher clickbait. He is in the game but only for one battle. So, the pictures of Geralt were a bit annoying for me. Even though, it wasn’t a bad game, I gave a thumbs down because I got really bored and forced myself to finish it.","this one is another in-between game for me. art style is pretty good, writing is

Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales,"Thronebreaker is a very creative take on the Witcher's Gwent mini-game, wrapped in a superbly written and voiced single player campaign.   The ""battles"" all take place in card form, and the game is very clever on presenting unique scenarios to change each fight.  Some of the encounters are puzzles: you use a pre-built deck versus a pre-built scenario.  Most however use a deck that you can add/remove cards from.  Outside of the battles, you'll have to make many nuanced decisions as a leader and ruler that often have consequences to the plot and your 'army' (deck of cards.) The game itself is very enjoyable, and I'd recommend it.  There are, however, a few issues which should be mentioned: First, it's far too long.  Even on the highest difficulty, you'll probably have assembled a pretty unstoppable deck about halfway through.  After that point, the battles can all be dealt with using the same strategy, so they get very repetitious, even with the various 'scenarios' that make them vary. Second, and this is related to above, but there isn't a ton of motivation for tinkering with your deck.  You can't save different configurations, so trying a new one means scrapping the old.  None of the scenarios really punished my deck strategy either, so at no point did it force me to change it up.  This all plays into the issue of repetition. Essentially, this game is super fun and well put together, but could really afford to be shorter or more difficult.  Even with the gameplay slogging along in the 2nd half, though, the plot, decision-making and voice acting really carry it the rest of the way.","thronebreaker is a very creative take on the witcher's

Titanfall® 2,"So, the single player campaign would NOT have been worth the original purchase price.  The game looks great, and I love the back and forth between the fighty robot and the running around on walls, but the the campaign is linear as heck and far too short.

The mixture of FPS human running around with FPS fighty-robot mayhem is really a lot of fun.  Like most multiplayer, you can expect no team work on your side unless you are part of some organized group, but its still a blast anyway.

Total War: WARHAMMER II,"Has a lot of reoccuring minor bug issues from the previous warhammer that was supposedly fixed. (Units changing targets randomly, reinforcements showing up in odd places regardless of map positioning) Looks great graphically, the campaign is ok too.  But they didn't make much improvements on 1.  For instance, there are no unit formations...no wedges, etc.  Heavy Calvary don't work as well as they should either.  The battle AI is pretty bad too (Send in tough hero, have archers just rain arrows onto all of the enemy units that cluster around said hero). I'm down voting because it crashes non stop after 50-80 turns into a campaign on a pretty damn good rig (Nvidia 690).  I wouldn't purchase this game on steam, you run the risk of this happening to you and then getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ over by their anti consumer return policy. Will never buy another sega game again. Edit: Years later - still has the retarded ""Hey look 5 billion enemies spawn out of no where"" stupidity and hasn't changed the complete idiotic nonsense of fort sieges. I just lost a 40 minute battle of slaughtering those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rats that randomly appear at the last ritual......because one rat ogre got through unnoticed and captured my city's flag....... Nevermind the fact they lost 90% of their troops and I lost ~10% of mine and it was the last enemy unit on the field..... Nevermind the fact that my units were in the middle of killing it......nope.....we all just decided to surrender and commit suicide. Edit 2: So....just lost a battle where I brought an entire army of hawk archers. Was wrecking the crap out of the enemy - mostly ground units - had ~50% of them killed and still had a bunch of ammo. But hey...we hire ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to design things so I lost the fight where I had 4 unit losses and over a thousand kills......because ""The enemy has control of the battlefield, you must land and fight on foot!"" or some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like that.....Entire army started wavering and then just ran off. I was literally asking myself wtf just happened, in pure disbelief. My brain - in all honesty, couldn't fathom the idiots designing this game were really that retarded to PUNISH ME FOR BEING SMART. Total war....except when it comes to air superiority.....then all your units just fly off and commit mass suicide. Game was never worth $60, isn't worth $30 either.

middle of killing itnopewe all just decided to surrender and commit suicide edit  sojust lost a battle where i brought an entire army of hawk archers was wrecking the crap out of the enemy  mostly ground units  had  of them killed and still had a bunch of ammo but heywe hire  to design things so i lost the fight where i had  unit losses and over a thousand killsbecause the enemy has control of the battlefield you must land and fight on foot or some  like thatentire army started wavering and then just ran off i was literally asking myself wtf just happened in pure disbelief my brain  in all honesty couldnt fathom the idiots designing this game were really that retarded to punish me for being smart total warexcept when it comes to air superioritythen all your units just fly off and commit mass suicide game was never worth  isnt worth  either maybe for  give it a shot,has a lot of reoccuring minor bug issues from the previous warhammer that was supposedly fixed units changing targets randomly reinforcements showing up in odd places regardless of map positioning looks great graphically the campaign is ok too but they didnt make much improvements on for instance there are no unit formationsno wedges etc heavy calvary dont work as well as they should either the battle ai is pretty bad too send in tough hero have archers just rain arrows onto all of the enemy units that cluster around said hero im down voting because it crashes non stop after turns into a campaign on a pretty damn good rig nvidia i wouldnt purchase this game on steam you run the risk of this happening to you and then getting over by their anti consumer return policy will never buy another sega game again edit years later still has the retarded hey look billion enemies spawn out of no where stupidity and

"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","Warhammer as a franchise has had many different takes and variations on the source material, with a lot of it usually falling into the same rhythm most of the time. However the original Space Marine title released in 2011 was a stand-out experience that sadly ended on a cliffhanger, with 2023's Boltgun serving as a shadow sequel to the former, but bow in 2024 we got the much anticipated follow up that despite everything it does right, had me feeling a little muddled in some parts. Space Marine 2 picks up two centuries after the originals bitter sweet ending, with Titus serving a self-imposed exile with the Deathwatch, and after nearly dying he is saved via the Rubicon surgery, going from an Astarte's to a Primaris, a major upgrade for himself. Now just like the previous game he leads a small squad against a Tyranid invasion with a lot of the previous games story beats coming full circle and honestly the story in this game is S-Tier, even though I'm not the biggest lore fanatic, having finished the prior game gives a lot of context that you will need, however the campaign for the most part is short, with some welcomed character appearances that I will not spoil. My biggest issue with the campaign is the lack of progression throughout the 8 hour romp of bug stomping fun. Don't get me wrong, the combat in this game is incredible, you really do feel like a walking tank with a conscious, but the variety of weapons, primarily Boltguns just all feel the same, and playing the game on a harder difficulty doesn't earn you anything special, however in conjunction with the main campaign you have Operations mode which puts you in the shoes of Titus's other battle brothers, performing tasks related to the main stories events which I find far more engaging as well as rewarding, even if it does get a little grindy after a while. Just having the feature to upgrade your equipment made it a far more rewarding from my perspective, you feel like your getting stronger through your hard work which is just top notch, and the inclusion of being able to change your chapter colors is also welcomed, especially when you can make your own custom armor setup, it just felt more engaging and personal to me, and this isn't a knock against the campaign, it was still a highly polished experience. The other mode to explore is the multiplayer which allows that same kind of customization as Operations, but new outlets have reared their ugly heads with complaints of the other Space Marine's feeling like paper, and listen I get it, the game is suppose to be a power fantasy with you being the ultimate weapon but not everyone can be damn near impervious, it would really muddle the experience and for the most part I don't mind this decision since you need to think about it from the context of the lore I suppose, these are Space Marine's, men with weapons that fire high yield explosives, so it would make sense that their weapons are effective against one another y'know? I really wish there was a horde mode like the previous game, and hopefully more Operations are added in the near future, because I feel the six missions already available might get a little old, or at least give us more opportunities to earn requisition points to help expediate the mundane grind.

a lot of the previous games story beats coming full circle and honestly the story in this game is stier even though im not the biggest lore fanatic having finished the prior game gives a lot of context that you will need however the campaign for the most part is short with some welcomed character appearances that i will not spoil my biggest issue with the campaign is the lack of progression throughout the hour romp of bug stomping fun dont get me wrong the combat in this game is incredible you really do feel like a walking tank with a conscious but the variety of weapons primarily boltguns just all feel the same and playing the game on a harder difficulty doesnt earn you anything special however in conjunction with the main campaign you have operations mode which puts you in the shoes of tituss other battle brothers performing tasks related to the main stories events which i find far more engaging as well as rewarding even if it does get a little grindy after a while just having the feature to upgrade your equipment made it a far more rewarding from my perspective you feel like your getting stronger through your hard work which is just top notch and the inclusion of being able to change your chapter colors is also welcomed especially when you can make your own custom armor setup it just felt more engaging and personal to me and this isnt a knock against the campaign it was still a highly polished experience the other mode to explore is the multiplayer which allows that same kind of customization as operations but new outlets have reared their ugly heads with complaints of the other space marines feeling like paper and listen i get it the game is suppose to be a power fantasy with you being the ultimate weapon but not everyone can be damn near impervious it would really muddle the experience and for the most part i dont mind this decision since you need to think about it from the context of the lore i suppose these are space marines men with weapons that fire high yield explosives so it would make sense that their weapons are effective against one another yknow i really wish there was a horde mode like the previous game and hopefully more operations are added in the near future because i feel the six missions already available might get a little old or at least give us more opportunities to earn requisition points to help expediate the mundane repetitive task overall the game is well crafted but i would recommend waiting for a sale,"['warhammer', 'as', 'a', 'franchise', 'has', 'had', 'many', 'different', 'takes',

"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","""The Emperor Protects... My Sanity?!"" Recommended? 69/10!! I came for the chainsword, stayed for the existential crisis. In Space Marine 2, I learned three things: 1. Jumping into a horde of Tyranids isn't as cool when they can eat your face. 2. Space Marines are basically caffeine-fueled, walking tanks with a hero complex. 3. I’m probably not cut out to save humanity. The first mission had me feeling like a god among men, smashing through enemies like a sentient blender. But by the third mission, I’m pretty sure my character was just angry that he didn’t get enough sleep or coffee because we’ve been slaying xenos for weeks without a break. The dialogue is full of testosterone and random battle cries that make me question if Space Marines are secretly poets who hate rhyming. And let’s not forget that the chainsword is the closest thing to therapy in the 41st millennium. I’ve never felt so alive. It’s not all fun though. There was that one time I was so deep in combat that I accidentally started attacking my own team. Turns out, Space Marines don’t appreciate friendly fire. Who knew? Space Marine 2 is like a brutal workout for your thumbs and your soul. Come for the purging, stay for the crisis of faith.

Wolfenstein: The Old Blood,Old Blood is a good companion piece to New Order. It feels more in line with Return to Castle Wolfenstein with New Orders mechanics. By no means is that a bad thing. Using old school ram-shackled guns in the 1940s is satisfying and this allows the player to spend more time in 40s which pales in comparison to short lived introduction of New Order.
