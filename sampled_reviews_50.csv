2069,76561198025583859,8.0,,Recommended,"Why does Kimmy have no negative reviews? This is a good question, and one I asked myself on starting it. The text is slow with no way to skip and the gameplay is a bit ragged, involving reproducing the rules of various children's games to others in order to play them. None of the awesome alternate rule sets are valid. At just about the time that I was about to quit and leave a negative review, however, I was sucked into the storyline. The children that you play with tell you their cares, and the overall setting is very nostalgic, making for a very comfortable way to tell a story that's still not so light in tone. There were portions that I still had issues with, but the storylines more than made up for them. EDIT: Actually, there are negative reviews? I have no idea why the page says there are only 12.",1.2 hrs on record,,

Dialogue seemed like one of those cliched after-school specials from the 80s.  Music was relatively fitting for the mood of the game; although, the designers seemed to either really enjoy it or pretentiously liked the song performers a little tooooo much.  This is because the interludes where VERY LONG for a NOT that great music number.    I think there was a choice of two different music cassettes for the player to chose from in these sections, in order to create some sort of replayablity......maybe.....idk.    However, there is no way in God's green earth am I going to go back and take an ear peak at a different torturous ditty.   Thank God! they at least gave us the option to skip the scene.   (thank you developers :)    *phewha*   That being said, I do actually recommend it and had a reasonably enjoyable 1.8 hrs of my life I'll never get back.     Oh, and if you like creepy closeups of protagonists ogling an 8-bit cheerleader with butt-hole camel toe!....well then, this might be just for you!   Good luck and have fun!",1.8 hrs on record,,
6535,76561197977935089,1.0,,Recommended,"My original review of the game was lackluster as at the time I was still fresh into my time with it, and at the time I didn't realize that the first 1/4 to 1/3 of the game was heavily front-end loaded with content. At the time, I was not bound, but somewhat obligated not to be critical of the game as I was for a few months a community moderator for the game,  I've since stepped down.  And its been several months since the game was released.  Frankly, the only word I have to describe the game is, an emotional dissapointment The world is huge, but as you exit the first 2 or 3 regions, the content of the game gets less and less.  Dont get me wrong.  When it runs good,  it looks great, its a blast to revisit the world in it's re-imagining.  And for the longest time the thing that had me most interested was the world state and the story. how things changed canonically since the last game. I wont say that I didnt enjoy it,  but I feel like the story was kind of a letdown. Very few questions were answered.  And I feel very strongly that whatever this game originally had for a script, was dramatically altered because of the invasion of Ukraine, Honestly I dont know what I was expecting but a lot of the main story felt like fan service.  It was a shame because the worldbuilding really did shine in some places. The gameplay was passable.  it was hard to get a handle on things when it was clear it was being hampered by bugs.  bugs like the A-life / Spawn circle spawning enemies behind you randomly,  AI refusing to use cover and acting recklessly,  enemies spawning exclusively with endgame gear all over the map.  When it wasn't bugging out or throwing Bullet sponges at me, it was fun. the looting mechanics and gear in general was also passable,  I appreciated much of the new toys but theres a LOT missing.  the artefacts were mostly great aside from the fact that they only spawn in preset locations just like the old games. (some areas theres static artefacts others it randomly generates one but its always the same area).  The weapons and armor were cool... the weapons were kind of a dissapointment in the modificaiton/attachment system though, I guess I thought many attachments would be modular.  especially with sights.  and I thought you'd at least be able to fetch some parts off dead stalkers sometimes.. the UI itself is more or less fine but the way the game conveys information to you is very bad.  if theres a reputation system in this game, I dont know how to read it.... It makes me wonder what the point of having all the different stalker clans is if they're all just passive to you for most of the game unless you attack them.. the older games had entire encyclopedias that would explain to you who the groups were, and they'd usually inform you too of their relations or attitude towards you. Political events in real life nearly killed the game,  multiple times over.  Its a miracle the game survived.  But unfortunatley, the honeymoon is over.  And the state of this game is not much better than Cyberpunk 2077 was in its first 6 months.  It has the potential to be great. But its going to lose considerable time to bugfixing and optimization, that will not be spent on new content. it will be worth checking back in a year or two.  Im not mad at GSC, I still like Stalker 2. Watching stalker die, return from the dead, and go through the ringer to get here again was a traumatic and emotional experience. Im glad we got it, it wasn't what I expected. But I still accept it. Until we meet again, old friend.",78.4 hrs on record																					(78.0 hrs at review time),,

It's this weird mix of turn based and real time, board and card game thing. It all meshes together perfectly. That being said, I do wish it were a tad less rng based. Whether you win or lose is too often determined by whether or not you get the right cards at the right time. Also this game is not balanced for coop play at all. I played this with a buddy who had no cards and even then the game became a cakewalk. I can only imagine how laughably p*ss easy this would be if he actually had a proper deck.

1984,76561197974286855,1.0,,Recommended,"Ohh this game can be a huge success in the genre. Although it is in Early Access it doesn't seem there is something important or vital missing. Ok some tweaks here and there maybe needed but other than that it feels and plays like a properly complete release of a game. The mechanic where equipment is bound to the cards is interesting but i would like to have the option to play the classic way as well. Where the cards and the equipment are separate aspects in the game. I understand the critique that Act 1 is really long but i didn't mind to be honest. I am 6 hrs into Act 1, i am close to finish it and i am not bored at all. So, having said that i would like to see some things added or tweaked to the game, if the devs are up for it. 1) I would like it to have a multiplayer coop mode/option. I mean, i really would love to play this game with 2 or 3 of my friends, forming a D&D like pose and go after the missions. It would be really fun and unique as i don't know any other games (apart from a few classic RPGs) that you can do that. Wot you think devs? is that feasible? 2) I would like to be able to have a party of more than 3 heros. A system like the on used in XCOM2 where you start with few but you can end up with more characters in your squad. 3) As mentioned above i would like a more classic approach mode where equipment is equipment and cards are cards with their individual mechanics and strategy layer. 4)  I would like to see a simpler way as to where or whom the enemies are going to attack. Like by simply hovering on their picture instead of trying to  pick out the tiny attack symbol at the bottom of their figure amongst other tiny infos. 5) I would like a modifier description on what the different terrains do and how they can affect attacks and defences. I hope that the devs will keep developing and supporting the game because they really took a brilliant idea and made moree than the most out of it and that is why we have a very good game in our hands right now.",26.4 hrs on record																					(6.8 hrs at review time),,

1592,76561197992783558,12.0,,Recommended,"Fun multiplayer, not so much single player, good gameplay with some unfortunate problems. Combat is fun, characters play differently, there are decent build options via the skill tree and gear. Single player gets quite grindy with it being tough to pass mid-tier missions in one go. Playing with friends is much better,  clearing most missions in 1 attempt. Having a healer to support your damage and vice-versa makes a world of difference. It feels like a game that was built for multiplayer not single-player, and it could work really well if the population playing wasn't so small. It's very easy to drop into other players' public games mid mission which is nice. It uses a gearscore system, where your gear level defines how powerful you are, so in order to keep advancing you have to constantly throw out gear you like to slap in whatever new high level thing you find. Unfortunately it means you can't try to assemble gear into some kind of build while leveling. An absolute mistake in a game like this. The end game (gearscore 130+) is extremely repetitive, requiring 10+ runs to farm up decent parts to build just 1 piece of good gear. My crew gave up after we realized how slow progress was. Still, getting to that point was a good time. There is a very serious bug - if you get revived by a partner, there's a split-second window before temp invuln kicks in where you can be killed. After that there is no way to bring you back, even if your team advances to a new wave in a Colosseum. Other than that the game crashes a lot more than it should. Both issues are frustrating but don't happen frequently enough to completely ruin the game. Aside from the various issues listed above, it's a solid twin stick looter-shooter that I recommend if you can get a friend or two to join you.",77.7 hrs on record,,

As always I recommend treating Early Access games as if they're complete, that way you can't be disappointed if updates are slow or stop. It has all the basics you'd want - a nice tech progression, needs to meet (air, water, food, power), exploration and foraging mechanics. Combat is new and could use some tweaks, it's not good but it's not bad. My only complaint is lightning is a little too harsh - get caught too far from base and it's easy to get zapped twice and die :x Most players should expect 6-12 hours to feel ""done"". Once you've explored the surrounding area and teched and built what you want, there's nothing to keep going for. The price is fair, the content is limited but decent, and the cuteness is 100% delivered.

Admittedly I haven't played the previous games in the series, but I have seen the anime adaption of the first entry which I do recommend for people that are looking for a loose but faithful adaption of the source. To put it bluntly, this game has you playing as the most badass but edgy anime protagonist ever created, Beyond the Grave is his name and mulching goose-stepping punks is his game. Armed with his pistols, Cerberus, and lugging his coffin the Death Hauler, Grave is equal parts Desperado and Frankenstein, which is the highest honor you could give to a man like him. Throughout my almost 5 hours, the objective was simple. Kill everything or in this game's own words “Kick their Ass"" which you will probably do with absolute glee. There is a story here but don't expect it to be some groundbreaking story with a moral lesson to learn, it's simple set dressing for Grave to kill thugs in droves and honestly that's all you really need. This game does feel dated and a little shoe string, but from what I've read that's always been the case for this series and if you can turn your brain off for a few hours I think you will find yourself having a lot of fun.

I think the devs have hit a sweet spot with this latest update. PVP servers are ok, they do have cheaters and the game really isn't built around PVP balancing but that's not where this game shines, it really shines in its always amazing randomly generated maps and its increasing difficulty and various vehicles and goodies for patient players. this isn't just minecraft with zombies. its so much more, this game has made lasting friendships and memories, even from its earliest buggiest builds. but don't be dissuaded by that statement, its a solid game for solo players and mostly how i like to play it these days. i think you guys should add a perma-death toggle and go gold. once you've done that try and port it to consoles and add cross-play amongst some visual updates and bug fixes and i swear this game will be a solid staple for years to come, maybe decades if you keep refining mod support. also that new intro is sexy. give the devs some love people! its been a long road but they have been faithful and this game has earned its full price tag",607.5 hrs on record																					(525.4 hrs at review time),,

I'll write a proper review someday when I can be arsed to but right now I'll just say that this is one of my favorite vn's ever, and the one with easily the best writing I've ever read, but to be fair my list isn't really all that big. Sometimes life kinda gets in the way of doing the things you wanna do. One big pro to this, other than the stellar writing, is full voice acting. Also, the free upgrade patch for those who own an old physical copy of this from way back when removes those obnoxious watermarks that for some dumb reason they left in the steam uncut version. F*cking WHY >:/ But yeah, an easy way to fix that is just copypaste that folder ontop of the steam folder. Voila! No watermarks on your uncensored r*pe scenes.

So if you've ever watched Madoka, you should have a vague idea of what to expect in this. Just uh, like 100x more f*cked up, lol. As good as Madoka was, I personally think this is his magnum opus. I've been thinking about this vn ever since I first played it uh, how many years ago? Probably over 5 years ago. Had a lot of interesting thoughts about it. Like for one, it reads like a biography of Jeffrey Dahmer's personal life. I've read that maybe it's supposed to be an analogy of the hikki-neet lifestyle, and while I don't know if that was the intention, I can definitely see that. Honestly, one of the biggest reasons why I don't try to do reviews for sh*t like this and Planescape: Torment is because I'd have to write up an entire f*cking essay to even begin to do these things justice.

Even better than Alyx. At it's core, it's a puzzle solving adventure game, but with a lot of care taken so the puzzles are great for VR. The premise is fantastic: you start in an apocalyptic future caused by someone travelling to pivotal moments in time and altering events.  So you have to travel behind them and set things right. (Think Quantum Leap for all you 80s people.) The narrative sounds fine for a game but for VR... it's so fantastic to suddenly appear in historically significant events and live that out. Such an awesome VR premise. There are 5 primary moments, as well as 2 main ""home base"" settings, all of which are beautifully rendered in Unreal. It's triple A quality. Most of the puzzles involve using items from one era or another in another era, so you're bouncing back and forth using hi-tech solutions to low tech problems... or vice versa. It has a generous hint system if you want it, but everything is very intuitive. Most difficulty is honestly just keeping track of where and *when* (cuz, time travel, you know) you left some random doohickey. All the systems work really well together, and just every aspect seems so well polished for VR. I cannot recommend it more highly.",8.6 hrs on record,,

The concept sounded good, but I figured it might be one of those games that you really need to invest loads of time into to learn all the various parts, skills, techs and strategies. Far from it! The game mechanics are simple enough and there's not a lot here that will confuse people (although some perks are a little unclear as to what they do) but man, it will challenge you! The game is challenging and your death and demise is ALWAYS your fault! There is no luck here. Laziness and lack of forethought will be your undoing. That's the beauty of this game. Randomly generated levels combined with solid game rules and permadeth equals loads of replayability and agonising consequences for screwing up. If you like games where it's all about planning without the effect of luck, undpredicatble levels and the risk of losing with one mistake, this is for you. It's not a shooter, in fact, that's your last and often unwanted resort. It's a stealth game to the max and it teases you with the random levels, as sooooo many times I've died just wanting to explore that next room, even though I've completed my mission and the exit is JUST THERE!!! Do you leave an unconscious agent so at least your game can continue, or or do you attempt to strategically resue them knowing that the gaurd numbers ar eincreasing and that they will find you eventually. Great game. If you love strategy and stealth, do not hesitate. One of the best pickups I've had in years. Updates are pretty regular, and I have had zero bugs that I am aware of. I thinkn the tea, are approaching final game stage now.   10/10",53.5 hrs on record																					(20.7 hrs at review time),,
