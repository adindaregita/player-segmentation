76561197992939661,1,N/A,Recommended,"Been looking for a new game and am happy to find this one. It's the simple to learn hard to master type of game. The thing that I enjoy already is I can tell it's very deep.

76561197992939661,1,N/A,Recommended,I enjoy this game very much. And the upcoming changes on Dec. 10 are much needed for balancing. I like how the developers are supporting the game and continue to put out content. Finding a match is pretty fast which means that the player population is healthy. I hope people continue to support this game. It's fun!,108.9 hrs on record																					(47.2 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197992939661,1,N/A,Recommended,Really like this game. It's a little tricky to learn at first bc it's not straight forward as it's a game of 4 rounds. That means it's balancing engine building with immediate threats. What's nice about the steam version is that it can connect to the mobile version. Game is fun and great mini game. If you enjoy deck building games you'll like this one.,24.7 hrs on record																					(10.3 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197992939661,2,N/A,Recommended,I played it for about 2 days and got bored. I like card gams quite a bit and I'm even fine with monetization. I guess what I dislike about this game is feel like games are randomly decided by turn 1 with the random placement of heroes. Also feel like only a few heroes are viable making the games all feel pretty same since only a few cards are worth playing. I wanted to like this game but couldn't.,47.0 hrs on record,N/A
76561197992939661,2,N/A,Recommended,"I highly recommend this game if you enjoy card games. Really enjoing it very much. There is quite a lot of depth in the game which gives it huge replay value. Also there is lots of progression so there is reason to keep coming back for more. It is not pay to win as some people may complain. Sure there is some element of that as with any card game, but really the reason why you would put money into this game is to access more content. Like when you start you only get 3 flagships of either faction. Think of it like character class. All of the classes are fairly balanced and if you want to try out different play styles then I recommend buy some coin. I purchased some points to access the other classes and am having a ball. Do you want to play more defensive? Do you want to be aggressive? Do you want to be middle ground? How do you want to win? This is where  this game really shines. Also on top of that, it's a blast to play it in the star trek universe. It's always been a fantasy to do spaceship battles like these, and they've come up with a brilliant way to make it feel strategic. I really love this game and encourage you to give it a go. It's quite fun. And the last thing I really enjoy is that although it's a card game, bc of the way the animations work, it feels much less like a card game. I'd say the closest feel lis something like Slay the Spire.",68.0 hrs on record																					(45.1 hrs at review time),N/A

76561197974286855,1,N/A,Recommended,Play it with mics and friends. You will have a great time. You will swear at eachother. Laugh at eachother  and kill A LOT of zombies. Great replaylability. Need to make the UI more friendly but aver all a great co-op game.,28.0 hrs on record,N/A
76561197974286855,1,N/A,Recommended,"Addictive fun that comes with a ""pay to progress (faster)"" system. If you don't spend money on this game than you reach your progress ceiling very easy, very fast. You need to have access to all the Masters, to stand a fighting chance and yes you need to pay hefty for that. You'll need rubies and shards and cards etc to build and buff your arsenal and yes you'll need to pay heft for that as well. If you choose not to pay then your progress will be hindered. You wil;l unlock cards much more difficult and slower and you Master options will be limited. That will make you lose a lot aof games and remain stuck in a rank for much longer than others that probably have paid what is asked to have all the options available. It gets a thumbs up from me as a game/concept and mechanics but a major thumbs down because of the greedy money grabbing system.",707.7 hrs on record																					(34.5 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197974286855,1,N/A,Recommended,Awesome sequel to the legendary Left 4 Dead. Awesome graphics. Very adequate story. Very few bugs on release.Excellent fun playing with friends.

76561197974286855,1,N/A,Recommended,"Its solid, its fun, its relaxing but not boring. It is worth it. Nice artwork. cool dialogues, choices you make matter, the music is fitting. Can't think of anything else to ask so early after the release. I hope the devs will keep on working on this title. It has an excellent potential to develop into a series. Got it on sale. You should get it too.",9.4 hrs on record																					(4.3 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197974286855,1,N/A,Recommended,"It could easily be a smartphone game. It lacks any real depth, is full of repetitive tedious tasks, totally unbalanced and makes you lose any interest after few turns. I think these developers are spam spawning these type of games 'cuz if you look closely, their other games, are designed with excactly the same philosophy. This is not a strategy game.None of their games are actually strategy games. There is nothing to ponder, plan and execute. There not even any actual opponents. This is a, ""click and click again"" game in order to do the same things over and over again. The only thing is good for is to test the durability of your left mouse button. Stir away of this one unless you want something to play when totally bored out of your life.",3.5 hrs on record,N/A

76561197974286855,1,N/A,Recommended,"Ohh this game can be a huge success in the genre. Although it is in Early Access it doesn't seem there is something important or vital missing. Ok some tweaks here and there maybe needed but other than that it feels and plays like a properly complete release of a game. The mechanic where equipment is bound to the cards is interesting but i would like to have the option to play the classic way as well. Where the cards and the equipment are separate aspects in the game. I understand the critique that Act 1 is really long but i didn't mind to be honest. I am 6 hrs into Act 1, i am close to finish it and i am not bored at all. So, having said that i would like to see some things added or tweaked to the game, if the devs are up for it. 1) I would like it to have a multiplayer coop mode/option. I mean, i really would love to play this game with 2 or 3 of my friends, forming a D&D like pose and go after the missions. It would be really fun and unique as i don't know any other games (apart from a few classic RPGs) that you can do that. Wot you think devs? is that feasible? 2) I would like to be able to have a party of more than 3 heros. A system like the on used in XCOM2 where you start with few but you can end up with more characters in your squad. 3) As mentioned above i would like a more classic approach mode where equipment is equipment and cards are cards with their individual mechanics and strategy layer. 4)  I would like to see a simpler way as to where or whom the enemies are going to attack. Like by simply hovering on their picture instead of trying to  pick out the tiny attack symbol at the bottom of their figure amongst other tiny infos. 5) I would like a modifier description on what the different terrains do and how they can affect attacks and defences. I hope that the devs will keep developing and supporting the game because they really took a brilliant idea and made moree than the most out of it and that is why we have a very good game in our hands right now.",26.4 hrs on record																					(6.8 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197974286855,1,N/A,Recommended,"The game could have been fun. It has the potential to be a fun game, really. but it fails miserably. Every character you play is slower and more difficult to handle in corners than the AI. When the AI gets the character you previously had then it is A LOT faster and handles corners almost perfectly. Thus the race mechanics really fail you every time. The money system will give you such a gringe feeling. It takes SOOOO long to get a decent ammount of money even for the simplest upgrade. I didn't made it that far to get a useful upgrade. Also, can someone explain to me what is this upgrade that lets you unlock scenes from a storyboard? what is the frickin' use of that? Last but most importantly, when you finish a championship, no matter if you finish 1st or last, the game gets you back to the main menu where the only thing you can do is exit the game. you cannot buy things, you cannot enter another championship, you cannot enter ANY OTHER game mode. In conclusion, the game is both badly executed and broken. Don't get it even if you find it in a free giveaway.",1.9 hrs on record,N/A
76561197974286855,2,N/A,Recommended,"Halcyon 6 is XCOM2 meeting Slay the Spire for a brainstorming session. The game is fun. It involves uncomplicated strategy, short and fun action, management without the tedious micro elements. Even its repetitive stuff are not gringy. I mean they are still repetitive stuff but are not game breaking. The pixelated graphics give it a nice retro feel but if this game had proper modern level graphics would easily be a triple A title in its category. some improvements are necessary to the UI but other than that the game is a fine choice to keep you in your chair for hours. Combine it with your favourite music and you'll have hours of gaming bliss.",21.3 hrs on record																					(11.6 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197974286855,2,N/A,Recommended,"This game really has potential. It really does. The pixelated graphics suit the game nicely and the 80's aesthetics are very nice too. But we don't buy and play games just for the looks of 'em. The UI needs much improvement. You always feel that one click too many to complete any of your actions. For example, booking for conventions is burried somewhere in the menu of the game that you develop (btw the convention event needs a much better animation). Or for example, attributing new points to your staff, which could be a 2 clicks matter, instead you have to select your employeee, open the tab with its personal info and then award him the attribute point. Also, the events/news tab is too cluttered and rolling too fast even in normal speed. Same story with the ""upgrading hardware"" event which should have been more intuitive (like leasing or buying equipment, or even trying to develop your own hardware) The game could really use a much slower pace (similar to Epic speed in Civilisation games) and off course a tech tree. It also needs more questions to be added on the interviews you give for promoting your games so they don't get overly repetitive. A negotiations mechanism is needed badly. It would really offer much to the game to be able to negotiate the salaries of your employees, their raises, the price that you have to pay to publishers etc. Or even to purchase technology from another company, or the rghts to a movie or a book or even a game from a rival. Nevertheless, the developer seems to listen to the community and really trying to improve the game on the suggestions from the users. The game is a very honest and very decent effort that may leaves much to be desired but does not leave a bad taste on your....mouse. Also there are not many great tech tycoon games out there and for all those reasons, i recommend this game, hoping that it will improve more over time.",16.8 hrs on record																					(9.8 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197974286855,2,N/A,Recommended,"This a game with great potential but at its current state it gets repetitive very quickly. It needs many additions to become a full grown title with replayability. User abc (his comment is the first on the comments section) has made some very intresting recomendations like: 1) Multipleer, 8 players as minium 2) Different specilzation of bank business with specific bonuses 3) Big technology tree with unique ways of development 4) Diplomacy with another banks 5) More variants for investments(building univercities, hospitals, cathedrals and another objects) all these features are the bare minimum and badly needed for an enhanced game.",11.4 hrs on record																					(9.6 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197974286855,2,N/A,Recommended,"Well, this is a good game. It really is. It is intuitive and as much complex as to keep things interestind and deep without getting overcomplicated. Its mechanics add a simple but interesting strategy layer to your play without having to overthing your every move. All of the above grant great replayablity value to the game. Last but mostly important, no ingame buys, no microtranscations, no ""buy-to-win"" path to victory. This kind of gaming mentality is getting rarer nowadys and must be apreciated when found.

Endless kudos to the devs that managed to create a modern RPG that stays true as none other to the spirit of classic D&D. The community has embraced this game it it showing by creating additional workshop content and of course by massively giving positive reviews. this is not slash and hack, this is not rushing from an enemy to another, this is not pintless written info just to fill game hours. This game is well thought, planned and executed. You wont find a single youtube reviewer not giving a triumphant ""thumbs up"" to Original Sin 2.

76561197974286855,2,N/A,Recommended,"The hype for Endless Space 2 was great before the release. This usualy brings some justified suspicion on the costumers side as many times in the past games that were eagerly expected turned out big flukes. But ES2 managed to avoid this pattern. The game is not only a worthy sequel but it came out well polished as well. This is important as many devs and studios prefer to just release the sequels that seem and feel half finished and then try to catch up in DLC land. The game delivers in all its promises and it delivers in a balanced way. There isnt any feeling that some aspect of the game carry more wight than others although there are factors that indeed, in specific circumstances, matter more. This series has potential. As long as the devs keep on listening to the community and have the ability to synthesise the many different ideas, ES will have many succesfull sequels.",121.5 hrs on record																					(40.7 hrs at review time),N/A
