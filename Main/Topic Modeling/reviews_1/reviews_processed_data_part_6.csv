76561197971757081,1,Far Cry® 4,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"Cry me a river. --What is it?-- A first person shooter set in Kyrat. The usual Farcry formula, finding radio towers to open up the map, picking flowers for your health apothecary, and a dictator to overthrow. There's a lot of quests, some even drive past you. A large monotonous terrain to explore, with very few changes in variety, that is focusing on making the most of the pretty foliage, trees and rock detail. There are many things to collect that will unlock weapons and upgrades. There's a story to drive things along, nothing too exiting, with it being fun just driving around and shooting things, who needs a story. Sometimes the way the landscape is designed to tie in with the location of quests is impressive and you can see they put a lot of effort into creating the world. And sometimes everything feels rather underwhelming. You can choose to drive, run or fly around, and explore everywhere up to a point. The map will be locked until you follow the story to unlock it further, just to remind you that there is a story to follow. The story is played out in first person as people chat to you, it's done really well from a technical point, to have all the animations act their dialog to you, and fits in with the scenery. There are plenty of weapons to unlock with there being a slight change in all of them to make them feel worth getting. You will start off with weapons that are shaking a lot while firing, and then slowly improve in aim and balance, as your skills tree also improve. Once you've cleared out the first base and tower, it's very much the same thing over and over until the end with minor changes to keep the enemies improving in their defense. It still remained fun until the end as the bread and butter of Farcry is shooting, and if you enjoy that sort of thing, all the weapons at your disposal can change up your game-play style giving you that variety that is needed. There are however some criteria for unlocking some talent tree options that will force you to be more stealthy at times, while everything can be done very easily going in Rambo style, it can be quite the challenge to make yourself not be seen while taking over a base, and giving you a sense of satisfaction for apply everything you've been given to help you in that task such as syringes that give you supernatural boosts. The game runs really well even in 4K at this point on a humble system, there are many graphical options and engine wise gimmicks they use to keep it running smoothly, for a open world forest and mountainous theme. And it looks good even by todays standards. The main appeal is that you are outside for most part, you are not confined in a large building structure. And there's something very attractive about being in the open wild, having the opportunity to take on a compound from any direction, and any method that you feel, at any time of your choosing. That kind of freedom not only in the layout of the games' world, and the relaxed method that it allows for you to choose your path is where it's charm lies. Lastly, they improved the terrible camera shaking while walking and running that FarCry 3 had. Here it's the weapon that sways while the camera feels more stable.",1.8 hrs on record,N/A

76561197971757081,1,Far Cry 3,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"For crying out loud. --what is it?-- It's a first person shooter, on a island. For the third time around there is a story that is very clever and well integrated into the world exploration. There are plenty of plot-line twists and surprises. Good artwork and all around fun. The only really annoying thing was getting used to the amount of head movement while walking and running, was really off-putting, and excessive. It's not as over reaching as some other Far Cry titles, keeping things easy to get to, and to reach your story goals is well paced and keeps it interesting and fun all the way.",1.4 hrs on record,N/A
76561197971757081,1,Need for Speed™ Rivals,"Action, Adventure, Racing",Recommended,"I feel the need, the need to drive around town. --what is it?-- It's a driving game, in a arcade style. You get to choose from 3 different objectives to complete during a race, that suits your style. When you complete the objectives, you unlock the next race and then keep on doing that again, pick a objective, have a race, and get some points to buy cars. You can choose to be the cops or not cops. You get some additional helpful items that can benefit you in a race, such as boosters or spike strips. I was put off by the brownish colour tint the game seems to have for a while. As time went on, it was less noticable and it looked better and better the more cars I unlocked. But there is a serious lack of colour that originally was a eyesore. The car models are stunning. The cars handle a lot with the feeling that it's on rails, and if you are used to a more modern Need for speed title, it will feel like you are stuck on the road like glue. Mainly it has to do with the fact that the roads tend to only go one way. You get a weird feeling that you are stuck on a highway. There's never any areas to stop, with crossroads, alleys or traffic lights, or a place to turn into any other street that's connected to it. The whole map is all essentially one big loop. In addition to that the camera I think, that's not as flexible as the newer racing games The car handling does have it's own feel to it, that is very arcade like and the cars feel very heavy. It does take some getting used to, and once I completed it, was really enjoying it thoroughly, mainly because the handling improved drastically with the cars that you get to drive later on. There are a few other major negative points, in that you can't pause the game. Also the keyboard default controls were strange, and worst of all the refresh rate was stuck on 30fps, which felt borderline unplayable. Once that was fixed with a command line that didn't work for me in Steam command line, but once I added it in Origins command line it worked from there. Everything felt so much better, and I could finally enjoy the game.",1.8 hrs on record,N/A
76561197971757081,1,Need for Speed™ Payback,"Action, Adventure, Racing, Sports, Strategy",Recommended,"They did not need to pay me back. --What is it?-- A really good looking racer. Beautiful cars, a long drawn out story to keep things moving along, and a open world consisting of a city and backwoods areas with plenty of races and race types to choose from. There are key points in the plot that gives very much a feeling of driving in a action movie. For most of the time it's a relatively casual driving game, and that's pretty fun all around. You need to upgrade your cars to be competitive as the races progress, and you can pretty much determine your own difficulty setting by how your car compares to the recommended level car that you need to bring to a race. There are a lot of cars that you can unlock to buy, and a variety of places to drive. There's also motor car parts that you can buy, to upgrade your vehicles as well as customise your ride in different ways to add a personal touch. You can change the colour, add art to it, or even change the bodywork of segments of the cars.",2.5 hrs on record,N/A

76561197971757081,1,Saints Row IV: Re-Elected,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"Saints Row row row your boat gently down the stream, merrily, merrily, merrily this life is but a dream. --What is it?-- A third person action game, with you playing the part of a charismatic leader in a open world, where you can pretty much do anything your heart desires. Lots of weapons to use, shooting, melee weapons, even a super hero fighting style. You can drive pretty much anything you can get your hands on. The game is set in a virtual world that is intentionally made to look not as good, had it just been set in the real world, and that being said, it's not that bad. However the colours and overall appearance of everything is somewhat limited in their attempt to make it look like a obviously fake, realistic themed virtual world. A big step forward in the character models detail department. With much better looking character models and modifications than Saints row 3. A step backwards in the story and game theme department. There are some great moments in the story, with brilliant quests with unique animations for those specific story moments. Fantastic and enjoyable game, that I highly recommend, it runs really good on my modesty system. Everything is way over the top, and it's fun that way.",9.8 hrs on record,N/A
76561197971757081,2,Watch_Dogs™,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"This game wants me to be a better man, than the man I am in most open world games. --What is it?-- A open world, a small group trying to uncover and expose dark deeds done by the power that be, story driven, action, and most of all hacking in the form of quick puzzles by creating a virtual power line circuit mostly to unlock a door. I don't like that it's referred to as a hacking game. It might be a bit deceiving. Sure enough, you play the part of a hacker, where you as a player don't need to be too worried about that. All the heavy lifting is done, and it's all tied neatly into a fun puzzle logic system. Hacking sounds very cumbersome and complicated and you'd need to have some seriously specific coding expertise to pull it off. What they call hacking, I call puzzles. Most games don't need puzzles, and are often very out of place. You will find in most RPG games there will be a puzzle stuck in at random, because intellectuals are known to play RPG games. And therefore need that sudden confrontation of a puzzle logic stimulation. The puzzle usually consists of the most in your face obvious thing, just to give you that reminder that the blood on your sword has been building up through a series events that isn't just you hacking your way through a sea of monsters. Here, it is a integral part of the actual game, it works seamlessly how it's woven in as a natural, easy accessed feature inside the 3D world. It is so much part of everything that you do, being able to detect a way to unlock a closed door in your path. Instead of going on a key hunt, you need to lock-pick the door through a virtual power line detection method, and unlocking the door yourself using a puzzle style setup. The only other games that I would give that high praise for meaningful, well thought out puzzle ideas, would be the Tomb Raider series, where an entire level can be dedicated to a puzzle as smaller interwoven parts building up throughout the entire level. Here it's the same where a mission consists of having to reach a end room, with you having to work your way through an entire building having to find little segments leading you in the right direction through means of tracking a hacking signal bit by bit. Another great feature is the police, that would literally hound you when you are detected as being up to no good. They are tough to shake, and are relentless. It really makes you feel like you have achieved something big, if you do manage to hide from them. They are aggressive as can be, and must certainly be on some kind of reward system for capturing you, as they don't let go easily. You can upgrade your skills, weapons and your technical abilities, which can assist with exploding obstacles in the world, changing traffic signals, opening and closing barricades. Everything in a effort to give you a better chance of escaping the police. It's a really fun cops and robbers scenario. There's some serious hypocrisy going on here. The game is wanting you to be a fighter for ""good"" yet you can drive over people carelessly, kill people heartlessly, and steal from people needlessly. And write it off as a casualty of war, for just a loss in your popularity. They emphasize the need to take down enemies without killing them, or sneak around, but if you are discovered as a trespasser then World War 3 breaks out, with the enemies doing their best to force you to kill them. It makes you question whether you really are the good person you think you are, or deserve to be seen as a good person. And therein lies the challenge, making it harder on yourself the more you try to do the right thing, in a world that does not offer the same response in kind. The story is where it becomes really uncomfortable, however it is better off for trying to have a story, rather than not have it at all. If you can overlook the whole good, bad, cringe and ugly of it, and just enjoy the game for what it does well, which is the playability of all it's features, the fun of driving cars (that does handle like tiny toy cars unfortunately), high action, and clever puzzles to open doors. You will find a very entertaining game, with a sometimes hard challenge. The side missions are fun and some are pretty tough, in a good way. And kudos for having the best smoke effects I have yet seen in a game. Some stunning world details for it's time, really good looking in 4K and runs well on my humble system.",1.8 hrs on record,N/A

It can be challenging, with a well thought out saving system to balance that, where you get to plant your save point yourself. Don't let it's cute looks deceive you into thinking it will be a walk in the park. They throw every platform gimmick at you in very well thought out, beautiful and polished way. The background art changes with each new visited location, as you travel around.

A remake of one of my favourite arcade games. --What is it?-- You are a spitting ape man creature. And as any good ape man will do, you are looking to find your kidnapped lady love. Overall the graphics have a very clean look to them, with a higher level of detail over the arcade original. That said it does look a bit clinically clean at times. Fortunately, there are some screen effects that you can activate to make it look less clean cut, and more like you are playing it in a smoke filled room, arcade in the back of your local corner cafe on a greasy finger smudged low res monitors of yore. The game is quite short, but it packs in a good challenge and a fun play-through. The levels and play style are the same as the classic arcade game, and in most parts you need some knowledge of the level to make it through, trail and error style, rather than good reflexes, although that is needed as well.",0.6 hrs on record,N/A

76561197971757081,2,Saints Row: The Third,Action,Recommended,"Saints Row the best one. Nothing about this game is realistic. And everything about that just feels right. --What is it?-- A third person story, action game. Able to drive any and all vehicles, cars, airplanes, motorbikes and.. spaceships. With you as the leader a fearless, the coolest, most admired badass effortlessly leading your group with a goofy charisma and friendly charm only ever seen from the coolest kid in school that all the boys want to be, and all the girls want to be with. I don't usually watch cutscenes and skip them in other games as it's generally just, go here and do that with emotionless puppets. Not here. They have a well thought out scenario for each mission that has very detailed character animations dramatically putting it all into perspective and setting it up for the hilarity and or general chaos that you are about to be exposed to. There is a detailed character creation system model for male or female that rivals that of Cyberpunk 2077. Tweaking all kinds of things that makes us unique, you can set your weight and muscular build. A variety of clothes to choose from to decorate ourselves with even further. You can even get tattoos. They managed to bottle fun. From friends having a good time, singing and laughing along with music while driving. The really goofy animations, that are intended to be over the top, funny and parodies of human society in general. Not taking itself too serious, while giving you options for difficulty, it's handing you mostly everything on a silver platter without the need to grind, also giving you a lot of freedom to enjoy all the game has to offer and unlock stronger abilities as you go. And yet there can still be a challenge in that, depending on how much you bite off at a time. It's aging extremely well. It still looks fantastic, and runs really well even on my modest system playing in 4K.",23.4 hrs on record																					(23.3 hrs at review time),N/A

76561197971757081,2,L.A. Noire,"Adventure, Strategy",Recommended,"Playing as the police, the other side of the GTA coin, having to deal with the mess that you maniacs left behind. You know what you did... I've been drooling over all the Rockstar games on Steam, and every time I look at the comment section, see people complaining about the Social Club feature. This has completely put me off all of their titles, as someone with limited internet access, and a disdain for filling in forms, I mainly play offline. I bought this a while ago on sale and got this game downloaded on my crawling internet, so this was a good test I thought, to see if their games can function offline. I started up L.A. Noire, and it asked me to create a Social Club account, and on the right hand side of that menu, in smaller print, to create a local profile. I went with that option, to create a local profile and it asked me to type a name, and that was it. I could play offline, no need for Social Club. And could play it completely offline any other day. Test passed, on to the game itself. This game features heavily on the character interactions and communication, the likes I have not experienced before. I've never been one to care for things like lip synch techniques, and in-case someone wants to see a good case study of how it should be done, this is it. Not only lip synchronization, but facial features with animations as well for that matter are very life-like, even though the models are slightly dated. The character narratives are not only shown in a cut-scene style, but also while you are investigating, giving your actions and the npcs reactions a lifelike give and take. And speaking of the facial animations, in other games it's done purely for technical achievement, or art for style points. Here it's literally a feature, you have to read the persons' body language that you are interrogating by looking at their behaviour, and their facial expressions. They really are life-like and you can see their personality in those sometimes very subtle facial animations alone. It's remarkable. The world is flat. Some claim that the world is round. This one definitely is not. We're probably used to a lot better open world city type scenery by now, but this has a lot of small attention to details, and the world is densely created with professional art while it does have a overall, what I would call a clinical cleanliness feel to it. Or best described as the look of a simulator of sorts, instead of trying to beautify everything. It's running good in 4k on my humble PC, and it's all a very pleasant experience. Plenty of old fashioned cars beautifully created, and plays responsive enough to enjoy driving places. While the world itself is a bit lacking in colour, they are not afraid to use colourful language and red pixels when the bullets starts flying.

It's time to leave it behind."" I'm a sucker for everything Star Wars. When I played Jedi Fallen Order last year, I was hooked. I needed to play the sequel, and I'm so glad I did. The sequel is better in every way imaginable; it's bigger and better, except for the ending, which felt too soon. When the credits rolled, I was like, ""WAIT, WHAT? THAT'S IT? I NEEDED MORE."" First of all, the gameplay was simply amazing; I loved it. The game feels more responsive and rewarding. I played the game on Jedi Master difficulty, and it felt quite good; the boss fights were so good. The normal battles sometimes felt harder than the boss battles xD. But once you unlock every ability of Cal, the game feels so much better; you can live your Star Wars power fantasy and blast ""DUEL OF THE FATES"" music. It makes me so happy that I'm able to do that. However, what felt like hell was Oggdo; yeah, I'm not talking about that anymore. The world in this game is also much bigger than Fallen Order; you mostly spend your time on two enormous planets with much content. Exploration in this game was so fun for me; I literally spent hours exploring Koboh without playing the main mission when I first started the game XD. There are a total of six planets in this game, so there's plenty of variety. Survivor takes notes from its predecessor and improves upon it, making the exploration engaging, and you want to return to places because the more you progress in the story, the more places you can access. The game also heavily focuses on environmental puzzles and platforming, which were done greatly; when you finally understand that you need to use certain force powers to access places or when you figure out hard-to-get places on your own, it feels so good. A new sense of pride, though pride is forbidden for the Jedi. The story was great. All the cast from the previous game returned for this game. As I said, I love Star Wars, so I was pretty hooked from the beginning. The start was great; it was fast enough and still told the story excellently. The middle game was also fun; when the ending credits rolled, I was surprised. I thought there was more story to be told. To my surprise, I had already sunk in over 40 hours by that point, exploring the galaxy while trying to rebuild the order or at least trying to save what was left. The new characters were great, and their introduction and storytelling, in my opinion,, were good nothing too exceptional, as we have already seen similar things in the Star Wars universe already; however, while playing, you do appreciate their thought process. By the end of the story, you feel so badass, using all of your force power and your favorite stances. There's also plenty of content even outside the main story; one of my favorite things to do was exploring the galaxy and finding new lore data. Which I know that the majority won't do, but if you have the time, I recommend spending more time exploring when you have unlocked all force abilities, as there is plenty of lore to be undiscovered and very useful upgrades that make the game more fun and easier. To address the elephant in the room, the performance issues weren't that noticeable. I did use DLSS, so I had good fps throughout the game; however, I noticed after 3 or 4 hours of playing, the game sometimes started to jitter; an easy fix was to exit and enter again. So in the end, I enjoyed the game to its fullest. However, I did face an odd problem of achievements not popping up; there's an easy fix for it. You have to close the game and open it again. Instead of pressing continue, press load, sit at a meditation point, and then go to the skill tree; the achievements should pop up. No need to uninstall it. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a great example of a sequel being bigger and better; this game is better in every mark than its predecessor. The best upgrade would be the map; it's more useful now. Also, thanks a bunch for including fast travel in this game; it saved lots of time exploring and collecting items. Absolute quality of life improvement. Unlike the last game, we have plenty of customization options in this game, which is also a plus. You often find yourself in search of better clothes for your Cal and BD-1, as well as new parts for your lightsaber. Enjoyed every single minute of this game and never felt bored; the gameplay was engaging and rewarding, except for the part where you have to fight Oggdo; as if putting him in Jedi Fallen Order wasn't enough, they had to put him in Survivor too! AND AS IF ONE WASN'T ENOUGH, YOU HAVE TO FIGHT TWO OGGDO IN A FORCE TEAR. YEAH, I LOWERED MY DIFFICULTY REAL QUICK ON THAT ONE. Is this the best Star Wars game? No. KOTOR is still the best Star Wars game ever made and probably the best Star Wars story, but man, Survivor was damn good! Cannot wait for the KOTOR remake; sadly, it's PS exclusive, but man, the sequel to Survivor would take half a decade at this rate. 9/10",57.3 hrs on record,N/A

Bioshock is a series that, for some reason, I never got into much. I did play the previous two games and enjoyed them, but not enough to make me love them. Yet, those two had something special, so to complete the trilogy, I started the 3rd game, Bioshock Infinite. The visual style and world-building attracted me the most, but in the end, this game failed to tell a good story, unlike the previous two. First of all, the visual style is great; it looks great even in 2025. The world-building is amazing to look at, but the game is too linear, which somewhat renders the world-building irrelevant in the end game. The intro of the game was so good; the carnival part piqued my interest; it introduced game mechanics seamlessly. The gameplay was good; it's just like the other Bioshock games but a bit different. Wish they hadn't gone for the two-gun system and instead did something like the vigor part, where you can choose which ones you want while you are in combat. The game has a looter-shooter part, but that part wasn't good as Elizabeth did provide the ammo and health. That being said, there were times, especially in the endgame, when there were too many enemies and too little ammo. It was frustrating at times. But also enjoyable. The different types of Vigor do add differences in play style. Some are very enjoyable to watch and play, and some are more effective and less enjoyable. Now the story, I'm gonna be honest, I didn't like it much. The beginning was decent, the middle game was forgettable at best, and the ending or the twist/shocking part was lackluster. When the end credits rolled, I had lost every motivation to play the game. Trying to add a time paradox always makes a recipe for disaster if not done correctly, and this game fails to properly do that, instead of making sense they just threw that part in and called it a story. Spoilers: First of all, the whole time paradox felt weird and low effort; it created more questions than answering the previous questions in the story. Secondly, it kinda ruins the chemistry I at first thought of between Elizabeth and Booker. In retrospect, there was a father-daughter-esque relationship, but it wasn't that much; the ending twist makes the whole chemistry weird. Killing off Booker by the end makes the whole game's story worthless; I found their logic unsatisfying. The Fox vs. the Prophet storyline was also not that interesting. The so-called savior turns evil; while it does reflect the main character Booker, it fails to attract the player. As I said before, the middle game was forgettable at best.",19.7 hrs on record,N/A

This game explores themes of isolation and delves into feelings of solitude and sadness. It is a game about grief. As I mentioned earlier, this game primarily functions as a walking simulator. Thus, the gameplay isn't particularly exciting; however, exploring the forest can be quite soothing. It encourages a sense of calm; there isn't much to do except hike around, fix things, and discover your surroundings, along with experiencing getting stung by a bee, being startled by a raccoon, adopting a turtle, and occasionally getting hit in the head. The beginning of Firewatch features a poignant story. As you hike up the mountain, you receive flashbacks of the past, learning how Henry met his wife, how they fell in love, how they spent their time together, and how everything changed once Julia developed Alzheimer’s. This makes for an emotionally charged experience. Henry struggles to escape his sadness, trying to forget that his beloved wife is forgetting him, while a father copes with the death of his son, creating a powerful emotional journey. That said, the ending of Firewatch was disappointing, yet it also felt fitting. Although there was no grand conspiracy, twist, or perhaps a happy ending, the conclusion felt like a true ending—an end to evading the real world, an end to trying to forget your grief, and an end to both summer and the job you took. It's hard to express in words, but the ending is crafted in a way that leaves everything open to your interpretation. Did Henry reunite with his wife? Did he leave? Did he and Delilah ever meet? It’s up to you to decide, which, in my view, was a wise choice. This makes the game more memorable than others because the ending prompts you to ask questions and encourages you to fill in the narrative with your own imagination.",13.7 hrs on record,N/A

RDR2 is one of the most recognizable in the gaming community, praised for its visuals and outstanding story. I always planned on playing it, but due to poor hardware, I could not for years. Now, in 2025, I finally finished it. I bought it in the Steam autumn sale but didn't play it until December. Finally finished the game in the month of February. 120 hours well spent! Firstly, let's talk about the story. What a beautiful story it was. In all honesty, the beginning was super slow; it almost makes you want to stop, but trust me, you will have to pull through that. The story really picks up once you enter chapter 3, even then you have a good story to follow with lots of interesting characters. The story of RDR2 is simply amazing; the ending is saddening, but the epilogue was quite wholesome. My Arthur Morgan got the High Honor ending, and man, I really enjoyed playing High Honor. I guess I should try low honor one day, but that kind of ruins Arthur Morgan in my mind. We will see about that when the time comes, I guess. The gameplay was pretty good, but it wasn't outstanding per se; it is what you normally expect from Rockstar. Now, don't think that I'm saying this game's gameplay isn't good; it is good, but it isn't anything new; it is fun and smooth. The gunplay is fine, too; I didn't have much trouble. However, every time needing to change your weapons was super annoying and frustrating, like let me decide what I want to use, Rockstar kept shoving me the guns I didn't want to use. The horse riding was somewhat annoying at times. Once, you want to turn left, but the horse does a 180-degree turn or randomly bumps into trees or NPCS. Talking about hitting the NPCs, man, the wanted system is so horrible; you do anything and boom, you are wanted. What an annoying thing; no matter how long you play, you just cannot get to ease at it. Sometimes it made me go on a rampage and unalive everyone in Saint-Denis. XD. The world-building is phenomenal. The classic thing you expect from a Rockstar title. Absolutely wonderful; however, I would like to say that, despite being beautiful, the open world at times feels empty, but then again, the story setting makes up for it. I can't expect to have quests in every part of the map, though there are lots of stranger missions, which were so good! I enjoyed all of the stranger missions; some were goofy, and some were emotional. The missions aren't the same; there is a lot of variety, which makes each one exciting. Like I said before, the story is simply magnificent. By the end of the story, you will be totally into it. It was emotional, the characters had proper development, and the story helped you to connect to the characters. I always believe creating a bond between the characters and the reader or the player is always the best way to tell a story, and RDR2 has done that remarkably. Arthur Morgan will be a great and memorable character to be. From being an outlaw to becoming a farmer with John, what a journey it was. The part of the story where Arthur says he insists was a great turning point. I liked how each chapter had something unique to add to the story; there were plenty of small details all throughout the game. This game has so much to offer, from being an outlaw in an ever-changing country to ending up becoming a rancher and staying with your family. Big gang fights, fishing, poker, horse riding, train and bank heists, fighting for your own survival, trying to help people, trying to help the Indians from the military aggression. And what not? Everything you can expect from it has it. Over the span of the story, you start to see when things change when being stubborn causes your very own downfall; despite being loyal to your family, you get betrayed. Love, heist, brotherhood, betrayal, revenge, and lastly, redemption—RDR2 has it all. The characters were amazing. I have talked about how good they were; being able to connect to characters is great. Apart from Arthur and John, Sadie and Mary-beth were absolute favorites. Mary-beth was literally the best girl in the game; I can't explain how much time I spent taking photos of her. As for Dutch, a great character, a great narcissist of a character, ""We need more money, Arthur!"". Dutch's story was done in a great manner; you can see when he loses his actual touch and how his ways change throughout the length of the game. And Micah, I wish I could unalive him from the very beginning. Micah is a well-written antagonist. Kinda a boring review; I haven't written a game review in quite a while. Would highly recommend the game to others. Solid 10.",119.4 hrs on record,N/A

SIGN ME UP! Hades is a game that I enjoyed quite a lot, mostly because of its unique story setting, recently finished the main story, yet there's a lot left to explore, the lore is immense. The gameplay is, to simply put, chefs kiss. It is just perfect, there's literally nothing that you can ask for the game to have, it has everything that makes a game great. The gameplay is so good! Though it is an endless roguelike game, it doesn't feel like it as every time you start a run you encounter a new line, a new insight into the characters. You have multiple weapons to choose from, each having a different playstyle, different stats, and whatnot, this makes the game so much fun, though it has half a dozen weapons my favorite one was the TWIN FIST. That weapon is too good and it just fits my taste. The characters are great, to unlock further stories with your characters you have to interact with them multiple times that alone will take you over 100 hours of gameplay, which I haven't done YET. I took my sweet time with this game, went on break, and was unable to play it due to a broken PC, but ultimately managed to finish it, it is addictive at times. I plan on reaching the true ending with each character, that would take a lot of time but it is worth it tbh. My favorite characters would be Meg, Nyx, and Cerberus. The voice acting was so good, each character has almost endless lines, and the voice of Meg was literally peak. The visuals were beautiful, and each section of the map was. My favorite was Elysium, it was marvelous. The one I hated the most was Asphodel, seriously that place sucks, the boss fight was good but man I hate Asphodel. In terms of the boss fights, I liked Hades and the Furies the most, the boss fight against Hades has two stages and it feels good. Theseus and Asterius were the toughest one in my opinion, I died there more than I died in the hands of Hades or in the pits of Asphodel. TBh all the boss fights were fun, more or less. The mini-bosses were annoying though. That being said, the Furies were the most fun, beating them was fun, and that first boss hits differently.",100.1 hrs on record																					(33.9 hrs at review time),N/A

Twice, I have gone on to defeat the first two bosses. But this time, I went for it. It was frankly amazing. What is most astonishing is how this game was made. With only 300k, the Developers made something that even a big publisher with 100 million couldn't. The game is psychological, and man, it was done so well. You can almost feel what is going on. the environment is so gritty and dark but fits the story perfectly. For me the best part of this game was the audio, if you are planning to start this game, make sure to play it in a dark room and have a good headset. trust me you will have one of the finest gaming experiences. This game focuses heavily on audio, the turmoil, and voices all are very important. This is the literal definition of EARGASM. The visuals are great, the developer did marvelous work with this one. despite being nearly a decade old it still looks great, the atmosphere of this game is so good. The gameplay isn't that exceptional compared to the audio and environment but it did its work. The game is mostly an environmental puzzle with some combat in it. Personally, I didn't find the combat that exciting but it gets the work done decently, you will feel somewhat satisfied nonetheless. The puzzles weren't unique but fit the game perfectly, the integration of the puzzle solving was done greatly in the game in my opinion. However I would like to point out one thing the puzzles need to be solved at a particular angle which kinda messes up, even if you find the correct shape the game doesn't register it unless you look at it the way the game wants. Apart from that I didn't have much trouble. The lorestones can be a bit bothersome to collect, I personally didn't go for it, instead listened to youtube so no perfectionist for this game. Now, what made me interested in this game was the norse mythology setting, Im a sucker for mythology and this game handled it quite nicely.",15.6 hrs on record																					(15.6 hrs at review time),N/A

And what a game to start writing reviews again. Had a blast playing the game. In fact, it is the best Star Wars game after KOTOR. It might be recency bias but man it was amazing. The story of the game was good. it was definitely better than what Disney did with the sequel trilogy, God I hate that trilogy. Anyway, I liked the themes of the story. It is a story of casualty, distrust, and trauma. As a Star Wars fan, I loved how the story progressed, we all know what lies ahead, yet the story kept me engaged. By the end of the story, I had witnessed a great game, a great experience. For me, the best part of this game was the characters, they were the heart and soul of the game. Each character felt great, their stories were superb, there was no lazy writing, there wasn't a character who was there for empowerment, and the female characters felt like real characters with their own struggles. Cal Kestis's character had a great character arc and development over the game. the way his character overcomes the trauma of Order 66 and learns to trust others again was a great thing to witness. Now let's talk about the gameplay and mechanics. The combat system was clearly inspired by the Souls game, and frankly, it was great. Swinging the lightsaber to kill stormtroopers was really fun, and the boss fights were great too. The progression was done neatly, instead of just unlocking new abilities, Cal remembers his Jedi training as the story progresses, which in my opinion made it much better than just unlocking new skills through points. Once you unlock all abilities it makes the game so much more fun. There is a huge emphasis on world exploration, the game is 20% battles 30% platform, and 50% exploration. the different planets have plenty of variety and challenges that make it enjoyable. you'll have to come to a planet more than once to do 100%, even then it doesn't become repetitive. The planets are lively and have plenty of things to do, you spend a lot of time just traveling and exploring places and the journey is fun enough that you can keep going for hours without realizing how much time has passed. If you are planning on starting this game I would suggest playing at a higher difficulty, it enhances the gameplay experience. The game puts heavy emphasis on parry and evade, always parry timely and make sure to use the force to the fullest to enjoy the game. One thing I would like to point out, the difficulty has nothing to do with the achievements so if you just want to enjoy the story and the world-building play it at a lower difficulty. Make sure to get all the upgrades for BD-1. you will get all the force abilities from the story, however the BD-1 upgrades and stim upgrades are the ones you will have to look for while exploring the planets. Despite having great world-building and a great variety of enemies the game doesn't have a fast travel system, which kinda baffles me, at least they could have added it once you finish the game, but nope. It did make it a bit harder to do 100% completion. Also sometimes the camera movement ruins the mood, it is not that annoying but sometimes the camera moves a bit weirdly. The story wasn't that long you can finish the story in under 20 hours, I went for 100% achievement for Steam thus it took me around 35 hours. Enjoyed every moment of it.",35.1 hrs on record,N/A

And oh boy it was amazing. The gameplay is the main part of the game. It was so satisfying The main attraction of this game is the gameplay and it is amazing at that. Though you would think that there is stealth gameplay in it but no this is a fully action-packed game. Which is the perfect game for me to play. The gameplay is smooth as butter. The sword gameplay is one of the finest out there. The blade mode and Jack The Ripper mode are perhaps my favorite, loved slicing enemies left and right. The gameplay mechanism is super satisfying and since it is developed by platinum games I don't think I need to explain anymore. The story is set in 2018. Where the patriots are finally gone. Riden the main protagonist is working in PMC. The story goes slow and does its job in a great way. Liked the plot and the outcome. The ending was unexpected like how it played it out. There was emotion, revenge, and gore. The story was nowhere near basic but definitely not the best out there, it's fun and enjoyable. However, it is quite short, barely 6 hours or so. Quality time but short. The visuals were decent. If you consider the time it was made you could say it looks great but to me it was fine. Enjoyable and playable. Didn't face any problems while playing. The gameplay makes up for the visuals. Don't get me wrong this isn't bad it's good but not the best. The music was so good. Every piece of music was fabulous and astonishing. The music fits so well with the game that it adds a new layer to it. Loved every single second of it. The game is difficult, I played it in normal mode the higher you play the harder it gets. But for some reason, the fight with Monsoon felt the hardest to me. It was fairly early in the game, the boss fight seemed harder to me than the last boss fight, maybe that's just me but kinda weird. The game is easy to learn but hard to master, will take a little time to learn everything I guess. Anyway, in the end, an awesome game loved it.

Finally finished Dishonored. In short, wonderful game. Loved the stealth gameplay, not a huge stealth fan but becoming a fan over time. This review is based on the low chaos ending. The gameplay mechanism was so good. Loved every moment of it. Did ghost gameplay with no killing. From start to finish. And honestly, it was magnificent. Had a wonderful time playing that way. Sure it took way longer but it was worth it. The ways you can approach a mission were great. So were the other elements. The controls were superb as well. Visually this game looks awesome even to this day. Optimization was on par. It was amazing. The game will run on any computer provided that it has a decent power level. The story felt kinda basic to me. A revenge, betrayal plot. But since I played it over a span of multiple months, I think I forgot the majority of the contents. So the story may be great but I don't remember much. However, the ending felt bland to me. It felt a bit weird should've taken another approach. My ending was the low chaos ending. Either way, the main reason I loved this game is the gameplay and gameplay mechanism. I have become a fan of stealth games these days. Since I played with the  ""no alert no kill"" in mind, it made the game even more rewarding. But as I said before the ending felt bland to me. Highly recommending this game. Superb experience.

One of my homies suggested yakuza to me. I played 0 and loved it. Therefore I am here playing other games. Yakuza games are full of content! The amount is INSANE! I have spent more time on Kiwami than 0. (I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT YES) with over 100 hours of gameplay and almost 100% completion, I am here to review this game. I will be comparing it to 0. Firstly The gameplay is so much smoother than 0. For some unknown reason 0's gameplay to me, felt clunky. But here in kiwami, the gameplay experience was much better and enchanted. The fighting system felt more smoother and responsive. I absolutely loved the fact that I had access to Dragon abilities from the beginning. Sadly it wasn't that good at first. Fun fact, I unlocked tiger drop after finishing the game. And oh boy,  The reward was worth it. After you unlock every dragon ability, It becomes essential and addictive. My main fight style during the main was Rush, Beast, and sometimes Dragon. The sad part was that I was unable to play Majima. Majima was a chad in 0, in Kiwami he's a goofy happy chad. Kiryu on the other hand was badass BAD! Seriously Kiryu was the definition of badass. The personality, the style, the innocence were FABULOUS. The story of Kiwami was as depressing as 0, if not more. The story starts off super rough and stays rough till the end. 0 gives a great depth to the story of Kiwami. I was totally invested in it. Enjoyed every moment of it. The story was super depressing. I was connected to the characters from the start, thanks to 0. The story is one of the best out there. Yakuza games aren't like other open-world games. It's more than that. The city of kamrucho is full of amazement. Full of positive energy. It will make you laugh, make you cry, and more. The story is serious but the sub-stories are hilarious. The story length is average. But completion is hard. I was able to fight Amon. The fight was great. Tiger drop really helps but using multiple weapons is a better choice. Swords especially. The gameplay system was much better and smoother. I loved every heat action. The economic situation is super balanced here, not broken like 0. The music was marvelous . The visuals were great. Yakuza is the best-looking game out there but it still holds up to the current generation. I highly recommend this game to everyone, Yakuza franchise is a must play. Thank you for reading this much!

First-person shooters are one of my most favorite game genres out there. But in recent years they were becoming the same thing with different textures. Doom being the father of the FPS genre had to rise again. Gaming is meant to be played and not to be watched. Doom 2016 was a reboot for the Doom franchise. It was a HUGE success. It revolutionized gaming once again. It showed that gameplay is the MAIN part of a game. Not some fancy cinematic thing. The gameplay was so much fun to experience. It was fun, which I didn't felt in other titles. Sure thing, I was late in the party, I played Doom 2016 in 2020! Always wanted to buy this game. Bought it on steam summer 2020. Downloaded it, Played it for a total of 30hours. And it was one of the best hours I have ever spent gaming. The visuals were great, sadly due to my potato pc, I had to play it at 720p 75%, even then It looked pretty good. The textures were great. Slicing through demons was SO SATISFYING. It's a perfect game for stress relief. Hopefully one day, I will play doom 2016 and Doom Eternal on 1440p,144 fps (Some dreams right?) Played it on normal and hard difficulty (that one below Nightmare). It was challenging but it was fun as well. In other games gives you instructions on how to do what, it's a good thing. In doom, They give you a gun, and boom now kills some demons. The arcade/arena shooter vibe takes the game on another level. Bundled with some of the best music. The gameplay combined with the music gives you a heavenly feeling. In other games, you are in danger but in doom, YOU ARE THE DANGER. The value for money is superb. Every level every mode is enjoyable. It's a fast phase not like most other First Person Shooters. Where you have to wait to walk cut scene shoot cut scene reload end. Doom is like, take a gun and shoot until you are gone. Overall IT'S A 666/10, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. It's something you should definitely consider playing in your lifetime.",31.3 hrs on record																					(30.4 hrs at review time),N/A

Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor took me by surprise. The game was really enjoyable. Enjoyed every bit of it. Middle-Earth Shadow of War takes everything done right from shadow of Mordor and improves it by an unexplainable margin. The story starts right after the ending of Shadow of Mordor. The ring maker and Talion (The main character) have forged a new ring, which attracted some new foes and friends. The story was rich and was enjoyable. They have improved the story. Completely different direction. Most of the gameplay aspects stayed the same, but some new ones were added which enriched the gameplay even more. The animation and gameplay felt more fluent and cleaner than Shadow of Mordor. Surprisingly,  The famous nemesis system got a HUGE BUFF. It was a really interesting and fascinating invention/system in the shadow of Mordor, But it truly shines in Shadows of War. No wonder why did, Wb patented it. It's MAGNIFICENT. Truly and worthy selling point. The combat of this series is a mixture of the Batman Arkham series with the assassin creed. Surprisingly It's stealth mechanism and gameplay is way way better than the whole assassin's creed franchise. XD Nemesis system spices things up since every orc you encounter has a different personality, different weaknesses different strengths which makes every encounter memorable, challenging and new. It's not just beat them up, it's thinking and dominate. You could spend hours playing the game without getting tired. Sometimes you will make your foes run away and sometimes your foes will make you run away. Sometimes it feels like you're playing as DARTH VADER in the lord of the ring universe (literally). The visuals were superb. The whole world-building was extraordinary. The game has 5 regions where the shadow of Mordor only had 2. All of the 5 regions are different from one another. All of them are filled with non-repetitive activities. (depends on perspective) One is a forest base where another one is located near a volcano. Swapping out one region to another is a refreshment. New visuals new challenges in each region. As I said the game is full of activities. It will take a pretty decent amount of time to finish. If you just want the story then it will take around 30 to 40 hours. But if you want full completion then it's more than 80 hours of gameplay. Cherry top on all of these is that this game has online PvE. Meaning it's endless. I aimed for completionist and it took 100hours! And I didn't even realize 100 hours have passed, it's that good. The value for money is unimaginable, even 60/70$ games don't have this much content nowadays. The end game meaning the shadow wars might get a bit grindy. But it is necessary to get the true ending. One which connects with Lord of the ring directly. Did face some bugs but they were one time only, so nothing to worry about.

Definitely a m-i-l-f. Bayonetta is the offspring of DMC and Dark Souls in a GOOD way. Bayonetta is a great example of a pc port done right. Though there is some issue like sudden fps drop(faced once or twice), overall it's a solid game. I played this game in 2021, over a decade later of release. Even in 2021, this game holds a strong position. The gameplay is super fun, challenging and simp-able character. You play as thicc momma  BAYONETTA. She has a great personality and skills. The developers spent most of their time developing the character than the story but IT'S ENJOYABLE. The worst thing about the game? CAMERA. The reason I don't like to play old games is the camera. The camera system is the worst. Half of the I can't even see what's on the screen let alone fight. I am not a story fan. I am a gameplay enjoyer. And the gameplay is the secondary part of the game first one being Bayonetta. Every level has plenty of enemies to defeat making it enjoyable. Since we are talking about fight I wanna point out that you gonna die a lot here, I MEAN ALOT.  But when you clear the level damn that feeling is great. This game has given me enough confidence that I am starting dark souls. Bayonetta is a combo-based game so the higher combo you get the higher damage you do. But some levels are stretched out with no direction whatsoever. Visuals are ok. So is the music/sound. Considering it's from 2009 ... Overall HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

And man o man It was freaking WORTH IT. Yakuza isn't like typical games. It's more like an animated movie with some badass/button smashing fights which are relatively enjoyable thanks to the style of the game. The main story is full of emotions and twist. Ngl, I have never faced these many emotions at once. Sometimes you're serious and boom side quest starts and you go from hulk to spiderman. (pun intended). The developers did an excellent job. Truly remarkable. At first, you may think it's a simple revenge plot but my friend it's not, it's more than that. Every character is memorable. For some you will feel bad for some you will feel depressed or even become angry. The game has soo much content that it will keep you busy for days or even months. There's a lot of things to do. Kamrucho and sotenbori are full of their own charm. You play as 2 characters. Kriyo and majima. Each of them has their own problem and story. The further you progress in the story the further you discover about them. Stories are well-written. Writers did outstanding work. Each character has their unique personality and charm. Despite being a fabulous game, its graphical standpoint is a bit weak. Sometimes it looks gorgeous and sometimes it looks like a late 2000s game. Which isn't horrible but they could have made it a bit better looking. Kamrucho is like Tokyo. A city is full of emotions and activities. It's not like some other huge open-world game where's the sub-stories are relative or boring. Every sub-story is different in yakuza. Each Sub-Stories has something new to offer. Something enjoyable something, not grindy. Yakuza isn't for everyone. It's not like most other games out there. It's a semi open-world without car driving. But that doesn't mean it's cheap. Developers have made sure that Kamrucho would feel lived-in. In the end, Yakuza is a must play the game. Though it's not for everyone. But if you look into it then you will love every bit of it.

The game was superb. Enjoyed every bit of it. The nemesis system was absolutely fantastic. It added new characteristics to gaming. The worldbuilding was great. Plenty of free from and missions to keep you playing for hours. You play as Talion. Captain of Gordor's rangers. He's been cast by a curse. Which traps him between life and death. At this time he met celebrimbor: The ring maker who remembers nothing. Both of them wanted to find the truth and the journey starts at 20 magnificent hours. The ending was a cliffhanger. Which indicates a sequel (Shadow of war). Sadly the story isn't Canon in LOTR :( The gameplay was excellent. The nemesis system made the game interesting. There was a lot to do, a lot to explore. You can keep playing without getting tired. Every orc had its own personality and weakness. Which made the game fresh. The graphics were good, somewhat beautiful. The visual still stands out in 2021. The developers did a great job. There's a little bit of grinding which isn't necessary but help to become A BEAST at battles. Especially when you get Brand abilities. Making your own army to fight against senaro. Overall it's a MUST HAVE EXPERIENCE.",51.6 hrs on record																					(43.0 hrs at review time),N/A

The game is storytelling with puzzle and collectables. Hats off to the developers they did a great job. The concept is quite different. They tried something new. It's a matter of sorrow that nowadays companies don't take a risk to make something new, something out of the box... You play as a cop. Named Ronan. In Salem town where a serial killer kills you. And you try to find out about the killer who killed you as a ghost. AS A FREAKING GHOST. As you progress through the story you find out a lot about the killers objective and so on. The story was the main attraction of this game. And damn they did a great job with it. The story was unexpected able. Which made the ending a  hell lot of FUN. You might think A is the killer but it turns out Z is... The story was full of twists at the end. The story was mildly on point. You can just rush the story or collect collectibles. Now let's talk about the bug the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game-breaking bug. The game's current objective tab gets stuck on  *INVESTIGATE WAR ROOM* . Which is super super TRASH.

Sure the time has changed. The character MAX PAYNE has changed a lot. From a Badass guy to an alcoholic bodyguard. The story seems super slow at first but catches up in the late game. The first half of the story feels dull and quite boring from a story perspective. Later down the road, it becomes interesting and fascinating. Although the gameplay feels smooth, it's a bit clunky at some times. Slowing time is the most iconic part of the Max Payne series. The AI is good, knows what they're doing. Sometimes the camera messes things up. Enemies were challenging and required Good aim and timing which spices things up. Max Payne is one of very few third-person shooter games I have loved playing. The Graphics is okay. Sometimes it's great Sometimes it's old, old. Some places/locations haven't aged well in this game. Faced a few glitches/ bugs. Like no cut scenes, stuck on one frame with sound, not saving ... except those the game was one hell of a journey.

They're mainly own for their amazing stealthy missions and the protagonist AGENT 47. Hitman was a long-going series. Starting in 2000 and ending in 2020. The series is praised by a large number of people. The fanbase is divided into two groups. Either you like or you don't like it, there's nothing in between. For me, I enjoyed the game a lot. The missions had a lot more replay abilities than the previous titles ( previous titles are old therefore the gameplay is a bit clunky considering 2021). This game had some awesome moments. Awesome kills to get/pull off. The story felt very interesting and engaging. A47 is betrayed by the agency for something he did. Which I can't say because of spoilers. Regardless you will enjoy(?) the story. The Graphics of this game has aged well. You can play this game without squeezing your eyes. Character models are well done. There are multiple approaches to take down targets. Achievements do hunt. Sadly you can't do 100% on this game due to online being dead let alone online mode achievements. You can get your time get the perfect score/rank in a mission or rush it like a fool. It will take you around 15-25h depending on your play style.

You can spend hours without getting tired. Dozens of combos to memorize. Countless demons to kill. Huge respect towards Capcom for bringing this series back. I am huge(?) DMC fan as it's super enjoyable. The music the gameplay makes this game stand out. DMC is a land in Hack N slash. With every entry with a twist and different style. It's a huge change from DMC 4. Where the story stayed strong and unhold with every mission you complete. The gameplay stayed the same. Which felt great. **(Might contain some spoilers)** DMC5 has a different take on the story. The order of the games has been changed to Devil May Cry 3, followed by Devil May Cry, then Devil May Cry 2, Devil May Cry 4, and Devil May Cry 5. The summary of the story is: a new demon king has arrived, who is outstandingly powerful than the heroes. Dante got a gig to stop him. Dmc5 has 3 playable characters (4 with Vergil DLC) You play as Nero(from dmc4), Dante and V(newest entry in the series). The visuals are great. The characters are well detailed. The environment is now more destructible than ever. Pillars, builds, bookshelves are destructible and the animation is smooth. The gameplay style stayed the same from DMC4. The controls have been improved a lot. The photo mode was cherry on top of a cake. Photomode was simple and easy to use. The story was quite the interesting one. Tbh I enjoyed this one more than any DMC storyline to this date. Personally, I think this is the overall best in the series. Nero has been totally rebranded. Now he's less a simp and more a Warrior. The story intensives on dante arrival. Dante's OP. Every character has its own twist and turn. The ending hints sequel. Which would be great. Highly recommended. Probably the best DMC game for me.",39.9 hrs on record																					(30.1 hrs at review time),N/A

DMC is one of the most favorite game series among gamers. The main attraction for this game is the Combat/gameplay. DMC has been a great Hack N Slash game series since the first devil may cry game. You can enjoy the combat system. Spend countless (?) Time learning combos, getting SSS rank(highest rank). It depends on your skill and combos. The game is easy to learn but hard to master. You can just finish the game by spamming one or two keys but it's not satisfying. If you really wanna enjoy this game then you must Learn the mechanism and memorize the combos. Though the controls are quite awkward and confusing. You should customize it manually to get a pleasant experience. The graphics are okay. Character models and demons are decently detailed considering it's from 2008. The special edition doesn't do much except adding two extra playable characters(Vergil and Trish/lady). After finishing the story you should try Vergil. His character is OP. Since we are talking about the story, it's kinda good and meh at the same time. Like 90% of the story is good but the ending seems abit off. The story is basically Nero( the main character ) finding dante(trademark of DMC). Later down the road, things change drastically causing chaos. I do say it's worthwhile. At one point it becomes a typical Love story plot which is kinda OKEY(?) The game is decently lengthy with 20 missions. It took me 17 hours to finish this(got lost in some missions). Basically, it gonna take you around 14 to 15 hours. After finishing the story try to rush boss battles on the higher difficulty it's way more fun than you could imagine. Price is just worth it. Nothing else to say. Did face some minor bugs but nothing game-breaking. There is a grind to collect Red orbs and blue orbs. But I didn't find it too grindy. It might get a bit grindy if you want to max out your character which you will have done before ending the game(hopefully). A solid 7.5 outta 10. Pretty good game, has awesome gameplay, holds up in 2021 but the controls were a bit clunky on the keyboard. Especially no mouse support:( That's it. Thanks for reading. Keep smashing demons.

Gameplay was full of gore and strong violence (You can turn that off). Dialogs had plenty of sarcasm and humor. The gameplay is decently well balanced with abit of grind for ammo. The difficulty wasn't that hard. But they totally racked that up in act7. Which was completely unnecessary. You can't even see the sreen properly in ACT 7 chapter 1 and 2. It felt like nightmare tbh. Other than that didn't find any other flaws in gameplay aspects. Story was a simple revenge plot which changed/developed while you progress. I do say it's quite the deal. Decently good. The ending was unfinished. Sadly we never got a sequel. Therefore the story wasn't finished properly. The ending of this game could have set a great plotline but ....... Graphically the game looks good. Not top-notch but it works. Everything is clean and well detailed. You can the details while your in the slow-mo part. Characters flying, you shoot and pieces of meat fell apart.  It's just great if you love these. Overall I do say it's a great game. You can really feel the gameplay. It's decently fast-paced.

The story mode has a great amount of mission, the city feels lived in. I mean it's made by rockstar. Obviously, the game is one of the best open-world games out there. Los Santos city was built SUPERBLY. Hats of to Rockstar they did a great job recreating Los Angeles which the city is based on. Los Santos isn't cheap, HEIST IS ETERNAL. The ending missions were superb enjoyed those missions a lot. The story wasn't a masterpiece or GREAT it's just good, sometime good is better than complex/over the head or HISTORIAN STORY. [Yes Ubisoft I am saying about you]. Sometimes all you need is a GOOD TIME and nothing to worry about. THE STORY MODE HAS NO BUGS BUT ONLINE? FREAKING YES greedy Rockstar milking this since birth. Over I do say the online is better and more enjoyable than the story but YEA it's worth the shot. The game has multiple contents that will take around 100ish hours to complete.

The game has a charm that other games like this didn't have.(for instance the telltale games) not saying that other games were bad but they were unable to make me connect with the character like life is strange did. The story is more enjoyable, interesting, and suspenseful. Every action has its effect on the story.(not by a much but yes) Each character has their own personality and story. Each episode comes with twists and turns. You play as Max, a photography student who got admitted to Blackwellz academy in Arcadia bay. One day max discourses that she has superpowers, she can rewind time. She meets with her best friend early in the game and goes on some adventures/events which will change her life forever. The storyline depends on your mentality. Everything can be different from the beginning to the end depending on your perspective. It's like the game plays with our minds. It could be just a story or an Amazing adventure or a life-changing experience. (From my point of view). The game has a magnificent selection of songs. Every situation has its own song to cover. Each episode starts with and ends with a piece of mind-blowing music. It's almost eargasm. Something you will spend hours on the main screen listening to the OST. The game has a beautiful graphics/art style. yes, Life is strange hand-drawn frames. The art style fits the story and the direction of the game. Some moments are remarkable. A linear game with a detailed environment. The gameplay basically move and click. Nothing else Nothing fancy. It feels more like an animated movie with minor interactions.

76561198049296060,1,Dead Space,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"This is a very solid survival horror game. I never played the original so I can't comment on the differences between them. The best part about this game is definitely the atmosphere. While not without it's problems, the core story objective is very well thought out and constantly bring new interesting things. The characters you encounter are greatly portrayed and interactions between you and them are the best part of the story. Sometimes even the ship can feel like a character that you interact with with the amounts of atmosphere it oozes. This is enhanced with great audiovisual presentation with very few technical problems, notable being only traversal stutter. Unfortunately, same praise can't be said about gameplay. After some time it does not bring anything new, and even with new enemy variants lots of the encounters feel the same. Puzzles are often boiled down to bring a battery here and push a button apart from few good ones. My biggest problem is a that while interesting, the alien marker lore is not presented very clearly, and it is very hard to follow. This paired with a very lackluster ending hurts the story a lot, making it seem way simpler than it is. I would say that the whole 12th chapter could be entirely skipped to the last bossfight and nothing would change. In conclusion I liked the time that I have spent here and would recommend it to other fans of the genre. Just have your expectations right.

76561198049296060,1,The Evil Within,Action,Recommended,"This is a very unique game. If you came for the gameplay similar to resident evil, you are at the right place. Story is very interesting too, and plays with not so familiar concepts so it feels really fresh. Sometimes the story is too much in the background and you are just left to wonder what the hell is going on right now. You can find answers, but you need to do a lot of reading and puzzle piecing together which might not be for everyone. I like the presentation of the world and some of it's characters, but some side characters are really weak. I advice you do a lot of reading online about the story, it doesn't matter that much if you do it after or before playing the game. You might find some really interesting things that you might have missed while playing.

76561198049296060,1,Horizon Zero Dawn™ Complete Edition,"Action, Adventure, RPG",Recommended,"I am very glad this came to PC. I thought it looked extremely cool when i watched some Playstation footage. It reminded me of other similar 3rd person open world games I have played on PC. And when i did finally play it, couldn't stop thinking about how similar it is to Shadow of Mordor or Mad max. I know it might sound like a weird comparison but it really did share some similarities in my head. The most interesting thing about this game is without a doubt the machines and the combat. Their designs are unique, and each one requires a different approach to fight. This makes every combat encounter engaging, as you constantly have to adapt to whatever machine you are fighting. I really like that the combat difficulty is skill based, when you learn the best way to take down a certain machine it feels good because you had to experiment and develop the optional strategy yourself, It wasn't just that your dmg numbers have gone up. I hope that the second installment will improve the equipment because i have purchased the best thing for my play style very early on, and found just better coils durring the playthrough. Story wise, I liked the futuristic narrative about Farro corporation a lot more than the tribal parts. I just couldn't connect with any of the Tribe focused characters, at times even with Aloy. But when Farro corp was involved in story i did really enjoy it. The smaller stories of the side missions didn't very interest me too, apart from Hunters lodge and cauldrons maybe. What i really did enjoy was roaming the open world and collecting all the collectibles and doing small activities as cleaning corrupting zones or raider camps. I think developers did really nail these things and I hope they will return in the next game as greatly implemented as in this one. I think if you think it looks cool you should definitely try it, just be prepared that the beginning is slow and you have to invest some time at first to the story to unlock the more cool side activities.",34.7 hrs on record,N/A

Resisting the urge to play the best one in the series, Chaos Theory (one based on public opinion) I played this, the thing that started it all. While it has some rough edges, I really did enjoy playing through this. I felt nostalgic because it reminded me of an era of games that i played while i was young. Apart from some widescreen issues, it ran very well on modern hardware. The story was captivating, I really did like that it wasn't absolutely over the top narrative wise and was just the right length.

76561198049296060,2,Death's Gambit: Afterlife,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG",Recommended,"The story of the game is really great and it may follow some usual formulas here and there to justify some of the gameplay elements but it is brimming with great ideas. There are actually a couple of stories that you become part of through the game, I love this because the world feels like it is not centered only around the main character but has other very interesting characters with their own stories. Most of them are bosses which is very reminiscent of Dark Souls. I don't mind it at all because I think it is a great narrative tool and helps to make the world feel alive. The gameplay is best summarised as metroidvania and is very very close to Salt and Sanctuary. So as in other games of this type, progression through the world is walled behind some movement abilities that you need to acquire to progress to the next stages. My only problem with this game is the difference between my first and second playthrough. I think my second playthrough experience was far better than my first one. The only difference between them was that I had the knowledge from previous playthrough on what to do and where and in which order to go. It can make a huge difference and I advise you to follow the order of locations in some guide. Also one one last thing, choose only one weapon to upgrade because you can upgrade only one to the highest level. Upgrading multiple ones to some extent can screw your playthrough quite a lot And I would wish everyone to have their first and maybe only playthrough to be as great as my second.",42.5 hrs on record																					(37.5 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198049296060,2,Shadow of the Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"I think this game suffers a lot for being the last one in the trilogy. You kind of expect each sequel to be bigger, better and even more innovative than its predecessor. This game is bigger than Rise and 2013 but i think in a wrong kind of way. It fills the map with lots of collectibles which are in my opinion very uninteresting and don't give enough of a reward for finding them. Most of the resources you find can be spent to only upgrade your weapons or outfits that boost weapons or combat. Which would be fine but the game has very little combat so it feels kind of pointless. It has the least amount of combat from the new trilogy I think. I like that there are tombs and crypts because they are a fun sidewalk from the main mission, but I think that the rest of the collectibles break the pacing too much. Even more when you go to a hub area with tons of collectibles and some side missions. The side missions are what you expect from tomb raider hub area, they are in my opinion boring and not worth the time because they give very little reward which is not very useful as mentioned above. But it is very good that you can skip collectibles and side missions altogether and you will not have problem getting through the main game. If you have the deluxe edition you have the best weapons and outfits from the start so you don't have to worry about anything. When it comes to better, i cannot say that the story or gameplay  is better than Rise. The stories are either even or Shadow is a bit weaker. Gameplay is nearly the same, like this could be a huge expansion for Rise.(Gameplay wise) In my opinion the Stories have gone only downhill from 2013. Going from 2013 onward was definitely hard because it had set the bar really high. Making something better was a hard task so I don't blame them. I think if you are a fan of the series this is definitely worth playing. You will get more of the Tomb Raider fun out of this want if that is what you are after, but don't have high expectations.",20.9 hrs on record																					(20.8 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198049296060,2,Resident Evil 4 (2005),"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"To get this of the table, i really recommend this game and after playing through it i can really see why a lot of people consider it the best one in the series. It is a breath of fresh air and ideas after the ""regular zombies"" featured in the first 3 games. The setting of the village is really great and most of its parts work very well. The second area the castle is good too but lacks the character and the atmosphere of village but it is still great as it does remind us of parts of the first game. My only problem with this game can be best summarize in the 3rd major area itself. It is too action packed, lacks any character and has in my opinion has a really weak connection to the over all story of this game. It really does not suit it, as it is just another laboratory / army stronghold like we have seen in many other games. At least it is the shortest of the three areas mentioned. But i get why it's there, it showcases that RE can be more than just a survival horror and can lean into action too. I have to say I didn't mind the corniness of the dialogues because i think the game is very self-aware and can make fun of itself  at times too. So this was no problem for me. Only downside to this game is in the port. There is quite a lot of quick time events scattered throughout and some of them require very precise timing. That would be ok if the time you have to react or the amount of button pressing wasnt tied to FPS. Playing the game at 60fps makes some of these quick time events downright impossible or really hard. I had to go back to the menu switch to 30 load a game and lose some of my progress a couple of times which was annoying. But it really is the only complain i have. Go ahead play it and enjoy yourself. PS: I would really like to see what this game coud have been had they leaned fully into the village and cult side but we kind of got this in the new RE8 so i am curious what that has to offer.",26.8 hrs on record,N/A
76561198049296060,2,Resident Evil 3,Action,Recommended,"This review is only about Resident Evil 3, not including Resident Evil Resistance. I feel like it is very hard to talk about this game without mentioning or comparing it to Resident Evil 2. However it is a double-edged sword, It looks, runs, plays and sounds good like RE2 and that is perfect. In some areas it is different form RE2, it is more action oriented and more linear, which can be good because it makes this different and interesting in its own way. However the game is extremely short with very low replay value compared to RE2. My first run with collecting all things that i could, took me 5-6 hours. My second run took me 1.5 hours to complete it from start to finish. The game has no decision moments like the original had and there are no two ""alternative"" campaign choices like in RE2. When compared to it, I think this should have been a big DLC or they should have made it with all the choices like in the original and maybe some more content. Aside from this, if you can get it for good price i think if you enjoyed previous or similar games, this is absolutely worth playing too.",10.4 hrs on record,N/A
76561198049296060,2,Max Payne 3,Action,Recommended,"Playing Max Payne 1,2 and 3 back-to-back really shows how different this game is from its originals. It has to be, being released nearly a decade after the 2nd one it was destined to be different at least in some way because it was coming in a very different era of gaming. It is now a cover shooter featuring bullet time, with pixel precise accuracy with many in game cinematics. This is nearly the opposite to the first one and still a long way away from the second one. Nearly the only thing they share is the Max himself, and he is not the same character as he used to be. I think it is best to not look at it as a continuing of the previous two games, but rather a more modern take on the idea of what all can be a Max Payne story. So if you are not looking at it just as a Max Payne game but a game on its own featuring Max Payne i think there is really a lot to enjoy here. Game play is very polished and satisfying, Soundtrack is the best in the entire series and the story is interesting enough to keep you engaged through it s run time. I have to say that one thing that really sells Max as a character in this game is the performance capture done by his voice actor James McCaffrey. If you ask me, yes i miss the comic book panels but James really does wonders on screen. I think if you liked the first two, this is definitely worth playing.

76561198049296060,2,Prey - Mooncrash,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"Prey - Mooncrash is definitely an odd DLC. It is very different from the game it comes from, it shares the same mechanics as Prey, it shares the world with Prey, it shares some of the story with Prey, but it is not Prey. The game pace is the opposite of the main game. The main game lets you explore Talos 1 how much you want, it rewards exploration it is one of the main things of the game. The exploring of the station is core to the expirience because through it you explore the world and it s characters. In Mooncrash, exploring gives you disadvantage because of the timer. Meaning if you want to explore the map and the story of its characters you have to be okay with playing nearly the same segment multiple times. The magic of Prey was that each time you visited a new area it was something new, even if you visited it multiple times through the story  the station changed significantly. Here it changes, but not enough to be interesting for so many times. It just becomes another obstacle in your playthrough.  If you are okay with repeating very similar runs multiple times and like the original prey gameplay enough go for it. Otherwise treat it as a complitely different game, and decide if this type of game is for you. That being said, i would rate it like a 7/10.",0.0 hrs on record,N/A

So the only battle royal games i have played are PUBG Fortnite and some indie one with i own for like 3 or 4 years now and it is nothing more than a buggy mess. From these three i like PUBG the most, BUT that does not mean that it is perfect.In fact this game is far from perfect gameplay wise and techical too. PUBG is out for over a year and still has issues that it had in the begining for example : Server lag, random deaths from falling very short distance ,seeing through stuff , framerate drops etc...

Вам даётся голый кузов машины, и прикручивай детали как хочешь. Чтобы действительно играть в эту игру, вы должны знать хотя-бы основные узлы автомобиля, если не знаете придётся учить, хотя в интернете есть много гайдов в помощь. Но на этом веселье не заканчивается, вы должны настроить карбюратор и клапана, залить в авто все жидкости. Любой не дотянутый болт может служить причиной поломки, а их там много (болтов). Не забывайте, что вам нужно ещё поспать, поесть, помыться и т. д. (в настройках можно отключить смерть игрока).

76561198247877854,1,MORDHAU,"Action, Indie",Recommended,"Когда игра появилась в стиме я сразу же купил её, поиграл в нее и понял что это теперь одна из моих любимых игр. В игре присутствуют готовые классы, как лучники, рыцари в тяжелой броне, в средней, в легкой. Вы можете создавать своих персонажей выбирать им вид брони, их разновидность в игре большая, и вы можете создать своего уникального персонажа. При создании персонажа можно менять внешность, лицо, телосложение. Так же при создании персонажа присутствуют очки за счет которых можно брать определенное кол-во снаряжения, это значит что вы не можете одеться в самые тяжелые доспехи, и взять с собой все лучшее оружие сразу, придется искать баланс между тем и тем. По началу в игре присутствуют стандартные доспехи разных уровней, и стандартные оружия, чтобы открыть доступ к другим оружиям и красивым доспехам, необходимо просто играть, после каждой игры вы получаете золото которое можете потратить на кастомизацию персонажа и красивые доспехи или скины оружия, скины доспехов и оружия не влияют на их скорость урон и т. д. т. п. и это плюс. Так же в игре присутствуют перки, каждый из которых даёт вам свои плюсы, их очень много и все взять не получиться, ведь очки которые вам дают на создание персонажа не бесконечные, поэтому каждый персонаж по своему может быть уникальным. Боёвка в игре уникальная, множество всяких механик и тонкостей, которые вы познаете по ходу игры набираясь опыта. Можно настроить удары под себя например по умолчанию настроено так что в какую сторону вы повели мышку с той стороны и начнется удар, есть как и рубящие удары так и колющие, на каждом оружии свои + и - этих ударов. Есть оружия которые наносят удары быстрее есть которые медленнее, есть которые наносят больше урона колющим ударом и наоборот. Есть бомбы огненные и дымовые, капканы, луки, метательные топоры кинжалы, способ ведения боя остаётся за вами. В игре присутствует несколько режимов игры, ранговый, где можете играть 3на3 или 1на1 дуэли, есть стандартный режим 24 на 24 игрока захват точек, или же выполнение определенных командных задач на карте. Есть так же режим против ботов, где на вас и еще других игроков набегают орды ботов которых вы рубите, если отобьете все волны вы победители. Есть так же отдельные сервера сообщества с модами и без, где вы можете просто повеселиться отдохнуть провести время, или же потренироваться в искусстве ведения боя с другими игроками на разных картах. Выбор карт в игре производиться за счет голосования игроков после окончания матча, выбор довольно таки разнообразный и интересный. Физика в игре присутствует, как и расчлененка например когда вы попадаете по врагу и рубите его в области шеи, когда вы его убиваете голова отрубается, или же не до конца, когда как, отрубаются руки ноги в разных частях. Так же есть окружение, которое вы можете использовать как свое преимущество, например двери, с помощью которых вы можете прятаться от стрел, игроков. Двери можно как ломать так и чинить с помощью молотка. Вы можете выбрать набор для строительства деревянных стен, шипов которые удержат натиск вражеской команды но которые можно легко сжечь огненными бомбами, если повезет и их не сломают до конца вы можете всё починить используя молотки. Вы можете кидать камни, которые лежат в определенных местах на каждой карте, чтобы например свалить игрока который уже кричит и поднимается к вам по лестнице, или же пнуть его чтобы он с этой лестницы и слетел. Можете подловить момент и использовать пинок чтобы толкнуть врага прямо на шипы. Вообще в игре много всяких продуманных мелочей, например таких как блокирование стрел летящих в вас, вы можете отбивать летящие в вас предметы кинув например что-то в ответ или же вовремя рассчитав момент удара, ударить по летящему в вас предмету и отбить его, конечно же отбить его так чтобы он полетел и ранил обратно того кто в вас его кинул не получиться но всё же это физика. Одна из интересных особенностей в игре, это свой юмор который в ней присутствует хоть и в небольшом количестве, во время боя, смеющиеся игроки прямо в пылу сражения поднимут ваш боевой дух и настроение, играя в игру время от времени полно моментов в которых трудно удержаться от смеха, сами игроки создают эту самую атмосферу средневековых сражений, и находят минутку посмеяться даже во время боя, это радует. Конечно в игре нет голосового чата, вместо этого вы можете пользоваться заготовленными фразами, голоса персонажей у каждого разные, при создании своего персонажа вы можете выбрать ему один из готовых голосов, и настроить его тон. В любое время вы можете редактировать своих созданных персонажей менять им снаряжение внешность и голос. В игре присутствуют кланы сообщества в которые вы можете вступить набравшись опыта в игре, кланы иногда воют между собой создавая для этого отдельные сервера и сражаясь друг с другом в режиме 5на5 или 10на10. В целом игра очень интересная и атмосферная рекомендую всем игрокам которым нравятся эпичные средневековые сражения.",42.1 hrs on record																					(31.7 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198247877854,1,Hell Let Loose,"Action, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"Hell Let Loose – это когда ты будучи бойцом идущим в атаку вместе с остальными, под градом пуль, снарядов и в клубах дыма стреляешь в сторону противника из своей винтовки наугад и убиваешь случайного игрока в голову. Кругом смерть, хаос, крики командира о том какие же идиоты играют на танках, умирающих товарищей от пулеметных трассеров и разрывов снарядов, а потом бац и вам приходит конец. Здесь вы должны быть готовы к трудностям и реалистичным боям, здесь нет линейки вашего здоровья, а смерть может настигнуть вас откуда угодно, нужно быть максимально внимательным к окружающей вас обстановке. Игровой процесс: Для начала стоит отметить что Hell Let Loose это в первую очередь строго командная игра и победа в войне здесь зависит от слаженной работы всех членов отряда, четкой связи офицеров с главнокомандующим, правильной логистики и конечно же продуманным приказам. В ином случае фракцию ждет быстрая потеря всех точек и проигрыш. Многие люди идут в этот симулятор ползанья по-пластунски, из таких игр как Battlefield и всяких подобных аркадных шутеров, где можно свободно бегать по всей карте, попутно выбивая очки здоровья из своих противников. Приходя в эту игру они в первую очередь видят бронетехнику и думают, что если они были асами в танках или батле, то вот здесь и сейчас они покажут высший пилотаж. Но как показывает практика, большинство таких героев обычно быстро отправляется на главную базу с поле боя, будучи уничтоженными вражеским танком, тем самым отдавая союзную пехоту и удерживаемые позиции на растерзание врагу. Если вы мыслите около того или вообще предпочитаете игру в одиночку, тем самым игнорируя приказы офицера – то эта игра явно не для вас. Если же вы не попадает под выше указанную категорию и все-таки решили опробовать местный климат, то в первую очередь рекомендую обзавестись микрофоном, так как голосовая связь в этой игре, одна из важных механик и возможность донести информацию здесь ценится. В игре имеется два основных режима, свободный (захват точек) и атака/оборона, где захваченные врагом объекты нельзя вернуть обратно. Второй в большинстве своем сильно проигрывает в балансе, так как в игре много карт с полями и стенами из кустарников, атакующим бывает порой очень тяжело выкурить окопавшихся противников из некоторых точек, а порой и вовсе невозможно. Так что будьте готовы прожечь свой стул на некоторых картах, в особенности в Хюртгенском лесу, где карта представляет из себя просто рай для крыс. Если после первых боев вас все таки заинтересует эта игра, то рекомендую ознакомиться с начальными видео инструкциями в YouTube, о том как правильно нужно играть, что бы не совершать банальных ошибок и быть максимально полезным для вашей команды. Игра в команде друзей здесь является более предпочтительной, так как это все таки друзья с которыми вы постоянно общаетесь в дискорде скажем, соответственно ваша эффективность на поле боя становится выше остальных. Так к примеру, играя с тремя друзьями в роли танкистов, управляя тяжелым танком тигр мы наносили удар за ударом, а при постоянной координации нашим командиром, который был всегда на связи с другими офицерами, мы стали настоящей машиной смерти. Тем самым очень сильно продвинули линию фронта и уже через час после начала игры, при поддержке пехоты конечно, брали штурмом вражескую базу. В иных же случаях игроки, не понимая всей ответственности главнокомандующего, будучи не опытным, берут на себя эту ношу, тем самым подставляя всю фракцию по удар. Соответственно, если ваш командир сырая зелень, то беда ваше команде, фракции и вашему сопротивлению, проверено несколько раз на собственной шкуре. Ты часто запрашиваешь доставку боеприпасов, а вместо этого получаешь полное игнорирование, естественно логистика фракции простаивает, а команда начинает проигрывать. Но не все так печально как кажется, из-за крайней сырости игры здесь очень часто бывает весело. Несмотря на то что русскоязычное сообщество здесь не очень большое и в выходные вечером здесь до верху забит всего лишь один сервер на сто человек, повеселится здесь все-таки можно. Кстати, на счет игрового сообщества. Изначально игра была рассчитана в основном на западную аудиторию, о чем говорит большое количество серверов из западной Европы и США, а также достаточного онлайна на них. Как только игру перевели на русский язык (частично), в ней появилось три русских сервера и только на одном из них в течении последнего времени можно увидеть наших игроков. Да, это конечно печально, круг лиц, интересующих подобными играми в нашей стране очень мал, именно из-за этого не всегда получается поиграть с игроками, говорящими на родном языке. Практически все зарубежные серверы, требуют наличие микрофона и знание местного языка, хоть там и играют русские, они все же встречаются в отдельных отрядах и очень редко. Кстати, что странно, у Hell let loose есть интересный аналог Post Scriptum разработчиками которого являются создатели игры Squad, так вот, их игра не получила популярности среди русского сообщества, хоть и является более продвинутой в плане контента игрой. «Hell» это все таки игра в раннем доступе и большинство механик на данный момент находятся в разработке, из-за чего на фоне других похожих игр она может казаться слишком сырой и крайне недоработанной игрой, что на деле оказывается не совсем так. Да, в этой игре в данный момент очень мало контента, на момент написания этого обзора, в игре отсутствует такое понятие как «выносливость», ее здесь нет, потому что нет транспорта для пехоты. Из-за чего большую часть времени, приходиться тратить на перемещение бегом по всей карте к нужной вам позиции. Это очень сильно раздражает. В игре так же имеется ряд проблем, которые мы сейчас и разберем. Техническая сторона: Поскольку игра в данный момент находиться в раннем доступе и по факту проходит большое тестирование игроками, здесь то и дело частенько встречаются различного рода ошибки и недоработки. Некоторые могут испортить вам игру, а другие и вовсе привести к полному закрытию приложения, что я лично встречал очень редко. Но основная и главная проблема этой игры – это конечно оптимизация. Играя на высоких настройках, во время тяжелых сражений я частенько встречаю стабильные просадки в производительности, от чего fps держится в районе 45 единиц. Так же бывают проблемы, когда из-за случайных перегрузок на сервере, ваш показатель кадров может упасть до одной единиц и вас выкинет с сервера в лучшем случае, в худшем игра закроется и будет насиловать вам мозг разными ошибками при попытке ее повторно запустить. Я внимательно слежу за обновлениями игры и судя по последним новостям от разработчиков, в данный момент они занимаются в первую очередь контентом, а оптимизация находится в долгом ящике. Это конечно нагоняет печаль. На счет мошенников, за все свое время игры я встречал по настоящему наглых баранов играющих с сторонним программным обеспечением всего два раза. За игроками и их действиями активно следит встроенная в игру и очень качественная античит система EAC. Благодаря ей в этой игре этих криворуких уродов быстро блокируют, и они не успевают испортить вам игру.",24.4 hrs on record																					(20.1 hrs at review time),N/A

В отличие от последнего, нам предстоит кататься не по равнинам Америки, а по просторам близкой к нам границами Европы. Теперь по порядку. 1. В первую очередь хотелось бы отметить геймплейные качества данной игры. Итерфейс стал более гибок и несмотря на великое множество деталей, прост. Тут вам и настройка сиденья, и настройка освещения, и прочее, прочее, прочее... Плюс ко всему добавлена RPG составляющая прокачки персонажа. Чем выше вы прокачаете те или иные навыки, тем больше будет гонорар за ту или иную доставку. Но думать о персонаже придется не только за себя. Со временем мы будем нанимать к себе в компанию и других водителей, навыки которых так же требуют внимания. И вам решать кто будет возить опасный груз, кто займется срочными доставками, а кому вы доверите хрупкие грузы. 2. Графика!!! Графика претерпела величайших изменений. Теперь мы видим полноценное движение из ""настоящих"" авто, не просто клонированный пучёк тарантаек, а вполне реально существующие авто, и при всём этом их разнообразие и качество исполнения моделей ошеломляет. Окружающая среда так же не осталась без внимание, окружение красивое и качественное. ПРоработка деталей коснулась как простых лесов и лесопилок, так и памятников архетектуры, коих тут великое множество. Об этом писать честно говоря не охота, это надо видеть. 3. Кататься нам предстоит на европейских тягачах таких марок как DAF, Scania, Volvo, Mersedes-Benz, Renault и Iveco. По ходу игры мы улучшаем свой грузовик делая его не только мощным но и красивым.

Густая атмосфера игры буквально пропитана духом антиутопий Оруэлла и Хаксли, но самое страшное, что легко проводятся параллели с современным обществом. Первый признак болезненности государства, это принятие антиконституционных законов и наглое вмешательство в личную жизнь своих граждан. Управлять преступниками несоизмеримо проще, а если человек не совершает противоправных дел, то можно их выдумать. Абсурд ситуации, что это не наше будущее, а реальность. Большой брат уже не просто выбирает наш вектор развития, но и назидательно определяет группы лиц, делая их изгоями, в угоду политических амбиций.

Из-за этого все клепают что могут. Куча неудачных фильмов и игр. Ладно, если попытка клонирования игры приводит к модификации процентов на 30-40. Однако, это не тот случай. Достаточно времени играл в DayZ (мод), WarZ (он же Infestation), и DayZ Standalone. И все основаны на одной идее - выживание в мире зомби с другими выжившими, будь то враги и други. Конечно DayZ и Infestation отличаются друг от друга, это несомненно. ИМХО, DayZ в разы лучше и интереснее. Но не об этом... -Есть небольшое видео по ссылке.- Aftermath, он же Romero's Aftermath, разработанный компанией Free Reign Ent. - полный клон Infestation.

Даже недавно вышедший Cyberpunk 2077 нервно курит в стороне, потому что в плане внутриигрового взаимодействия там очень плохо (2013г против 2020г, прикиньте). У игры тоже есть минусы. Некоторые фишки, которые есть в GTA4, почему то убрали из GTAV. Еще минусом является немного скучный и короткий сюжет. Даже до сих пор не прошел все побочки, чет не цепляет. Хотелось, чтобы на любые ситуации в GTA-мире и в миссиях можно было влиять, изучать их историю и видеть их следы из прошлого, а не чтобы все было завязано только на скриптах. Вот, оставил ты машину где-то, ушел в другой конец карты (или просто сменил персонажа), возвращаешься, а ее уже нет, как будто испарилась. Именно это немного убивает логику игры. Но у игры есть один жирный плюс — это графика и оптимизация, она пойдет даже на слабом ПК. Но если еще использовать самостоятельные моды или присоединяться к модифицированным серверам типу FiveM или RageMP (а не обычная GTA Online, где в каждом углу читеры), то игра засияет новыми красками.

If you want to scratch the horde-shooting itch like L4D did, but with a fresh coat of paint and a kick-ass soundtrack, this is the game for you. I bought the game after their talent tree overhaul; it is a good change. It gave me the confidence that FatShark is in it for the long haul in supporting this game-- hence this recommendation from me. Their support is definitely needed, as this game has some issues. Objective ones: Crafting heavily relying on RNG-- Modifier stats, perks, blessings, locking. Sound cues-- how can enemies sneak behind me without making a sound, looking at you giant Ogryn enemies. The ""feel"" of power is always subjective and can always be tweaked according to FatShark's vision for the game. I like this game; it provides the comfort I need after a long working day. For me, the fantasy of mowing down hordes of heretics like they're Nazis in Wolfenstein and zombies in L4D is always gratifying. Darktide improved upon that: melee feels satisfying, gun play is weighty, the difficulty is hard yet fair and challenging, the banters feel natural while being longer, the game looks great, and the soundtrack is a banger. They nailed the foundations of what makes a good horde-shooter... not a looter-shooter. I don't want this to be a looter-shooter, please. FatShark, you already got me hooked-- I will kill heretics even if the base game only has sticks and stones for weapons. Heck, I don't even know a lick of what the story is about, but you made it so that I like listening to these rejects banter ceaselessly.

I was even willing to forgive its aging gameplay even if many cheaper third-person shooters feel better than this. But the story, man. As the story continued, it ungraciously soured itself, especially by the last third. Not even Max's quips and one-liners can save this one. Indeed, Max Payne, you are not slipping; you are slipped. Max Payne 3s gameplay is lackluster. Guns don't feel good to wield, and no benefit in getting one over the other--I get the combat rifle and bugger all else every time. The bullet-time mechanic is neat together with last man standing. The problem is that these mechanics only feel good about the first 50% of the occurrence, then it will be a cheat/cheese to kill waves of enemies as you progress, especially at the end. There are a few instances where the bullet-time mechanic shined, but it was not enough to save this game's aging gameplay. But I came here for the story, not the gameplay. The Max Payne series is supposed to be story-driven. It's about his innermost struggles; that's why May Payne 1 and 2 have him narrating the story and even during gameplay. The story started by setting up why he was there and his attitude towards everything. It was nice hearing him mutter everything from his disappointments to his self-loathing. This is the whole point of the game--elevate the story through Max's clever inner-dialogue. BUT! The plot was nothing but average. It led through some great set pieces, but this plot is your regular action film. I was okay with that because Max's narration is entertaining to hear. The problem came when the story continued on its last third. When the story revealed itself, it soured my experience on how it got resolved. There was a glimpse there that this plot will be exciting, and it got me hooked. I felt from ""oh, another gunfight... let's just get through this"" to ""wow, this story has actual intrigue and mystery."" Then it proceeded to throw curve-balls to my face like a malfunctioning ball-pitcher. The twists weren't even reasonable. It seems that they just threw it in there to have a somesort of redemption story for the other characters or to resolve the plot since it will end soon lazily. I wanted to like the story because of Max's character; he even had an epiphany moment and decided to change gears--I cheered for him.

76561198047132031,2,Katana ZERO,"Action, Indie",Recommended,"Came here for the kickass gameplay, stayed for the surprisingly excellent story accompanied by a delectable soundtrack: ZERO disappointments—an easy recommendation. The gameplay is challenging yet straightforward. Well-thought-out enemies are there to challenge, not just to be damage sponges nor be pushover imps. This game doesn't provide skill-trees, crafting, or even a leveling system. Its ""no-frills"" combat means the mechanics given to you at the beginning will rely upon your skill to shine and enemy/level encounters. This was evident throughout the game and peaked during the final stages. As for Katana ZERO's story, this game tells a great one. Few games manage to achieve this balance and intertwining of story-telling with gameplay. As the story unfolded, it felt cathartic in a way—dialogue choices connecting with the plot and mechanics making sense in the world. I remember what Yathzee Croshaw was saying when talking about game design; gameplay elevating the story. I'm happy to report this is one of them, chief. If there is one thing that I would like to have done before moving on, I wish I could finish this game on hard mode. But alas, I can't git gud enough. Maybe in the future. Katana ZERO gave me a taste of its gameplay; then it hooked me with its engaging story. Its soundtrack kept my head bopping as I try to finish challenging levels over and over again.

76561198047132031,2,Darksiders Warmastered Edition,"Action, Adventure, RPG",Recommended,"Excellent, albeit on the easy-side, 3rd-person hack-and-slash game. Easy Recommendation This game's strong point is its gameplay: responsive controls, badass animation, decent puzzles, and varied mechanics. Complementing this is its exploration, nice rewards, and just the sweet spot in terms of quantity (looking at you AC games); backtracking never felt tedious. Lastly is its graphics; its stylized design still holds up today. The story is decent but doesn't hold a candle compared to its gameplay. It is your typical gods vs. gods worlds in apocalypse type of story; nothing remarkable. As for its characters, let's say the marketing for Mark Hamil's The Watcher doesn't bring the comedic relief it set out to be. The protagonist, War, is an unstoppable force with minimal character arc; he was weak at the start, and he became strong due to his big boy talent of killing all the things. Other characters are just there to either make sense of the story or provide a structure/barrier. The only standout in the character department is Vulgrim and Ulthane, not because they offered meaningful story pieces, but provided the much-needed character this game lacks. The only issue I will gripe about is its save states and checkpoints. You will find yourself saying WTF when the game loads you from a checkpoint or savefiles. There were times when I continued from a previous day's play session wherein the game didn't save some of my progress like chests picked-up, and location I quit from (and yes, I made sure I went to Vulgrim and serpent hole'd to another location to get the autosave icon). Another is when I die from an encounter; the game will then respawn me in a state different from when I entered the stage; IE from full health, the game will respawn me with only 3 bars of health and the enemies at full health. Darksiders Wrath of War is a game that is carried by its gameplay and mechanics. War may be responsive and satisfying to play and control, but the lack of character development makes this game not as great as it should be, along with its cast of characters. Nevertheless, this is a great game that I recommend to gamers who want to have a grand old time being one of the four horsemen and beheading fools that come in your way—being an unstoppable force while looking at beautiful sceneries.",20.2 hrs on record,N/A

76561198047132031,3,BioShock Infinite,Action,Recommended,"10/10 For Everyone: Recommended. This is an easy mainstream recommendation. Masterpiece of a game. For Full Review; as my review exceeds Steam's charater limit [martopad.medium.com] Bioshock Infinite will always be the game that I’m scared of playing but will begrudgingly continue to finish because the story is so good. For a game that gave me difficulty in sleeping. Even after finishing the game, I was watching videos online about its lore, and explanation pieces. THERE’S ALWAYS A MAN WHO REVIEWS For a game that gave me nightmares for a week or two. Why buy it? It was poor research on my part. I mainly buy games on steam, and Bioshock Infinite is cheap during sales. And I say hey since it's cheap and it’s a game highly regarded as a masterpiece why not give it a shot? ... THERE’S ALWAYS EXPECTATIONS In this game, you are Booker Dewitt, who is on a mission to Columbia. A city in the sky. This is set in 1912, with some trappings of real life. It prefaces itself to a scenario like Bioshock 1; what if there was a person who aimed to make a city in the sky. Let me tell you, Bioshock Infinite’s graphics still amazed me in 2020. Its art-style holds up even after 7 years. Not to mention it runs well on my gaming rig (i7 8650U and a 2070S) considering I have an Ultrabook CPU. They went with this art style that mashes realism with a comic-book type of style. I’m glad they went with this because it doesn’t look dated in 2020. The moment you get introduced to Columbia; you will enjoy every moment of it. They sell the “city floating in the sky” well. From captivating visuals like architecture, famous American figures, clouds that obscure the distant floating cities, and cities slightly swaying left and right. To great sound effects like the loud roaring of floating machinery, crowd murmurings, crowd activity, bells tolling from afar, and old-school-style music being played from their radios. Currently, as I’m writing this, I’m listening/watching to ambient Bioshock Infinite videos on YouTube, because of how much content there is from just sitting in a corner and let the world play its thing. How I wish they would release a patch that would let players just explore the levels with NPCs roaming around without combat. It's so good. SHOOT, SHOCK, and PUNCH! As much I want to gush about the game’s visuals, sound effects, and music. This is only part of the game. Bioshock Infinite’s mechanics are also great. As with any Bioshock games, there is a mix here of both guns and Vigors (same with plasmids in Bioshock games). The gun selection is as expected. From your normal range of pistols to rifles. The game gives you enough variety to tackle enemies, which is shooting them to the face. Nothing mind-blowing here. Unlike guns, the Vigor selection provides many ways to combat enemies. From the classic “Shock Jockey” (Electro Bolt) to “Return to Sender” (which absorbs incoming damage and hurls it back to enemies). With the variety, I was able to find the combo I’m comfortable with; a Sniper rifle with Shock Jockey and Possession (which temporarily controls enemies and turn them on your side). But the game will throw you in situations wherein you must try and change your strategy. ... In addition to your arsenal, there is now a new weapon/exploration tool, called the Sky-Hook. It adds a new dynamic to combat and lore-wise it makes sense. ... Among the new features that this game has introduced. Your partner, Elizabeth is the best new feature they have implemented. Oh man, she was a big help helping me getting through this game. To whoever programmed her behavior you guys deserve a raise! They programmed her with so much personality, I can see why the steam community page is still brimming with Elizabeth's content. Once you get to be her partner, she will walk beside you as you explore and do combat. During exploration sequences you will see her interacting with the environment; Sitting on benches, looking at windows, throwing rocks at the beach, and many more. She will also ask/talk to you when you do something; going into female bathrooms, exploring objects, looking at decorations, and many more. She is also well-animated showing emotion well. One more thing that she does during exploration sequences is she will tell you where some items are by calling your attention, and she will also find and give some currency for you. ... The thing with Elizabeth that amazes me is they managed to make an AI partner that is not cumbersome, filled with personality and helps (I’m looking at you Wolfenstein: Young Blood). I would go on a limb and say that even if she didn’t have any combat-related functionality, I will still give a huge positive here. Because I liked her not because she gives me combat advantage, but because she has personality. I immediately got attached to her and was constantly looking at her behavior during exploration sequences. She made my experience in this game more beautiful. THE STORY THAT MADE MY JAW DROP In my opinion, the most welcomed feature that Bioshock Infinite inherited from its predecessors is its exploration-based storytelling and exploration in general. Bioshock Infinite will reward you by exploring its world. It will reward you by giving you in game materials like ammo, and currency. But the most important one is the Voxophones. Voxophones are the same as audio recordings. Same with other Bioshock games, Bioshock Infinite allows you to understand more of what’s happening by finding these Voxophones. I would compare the experience here to how raytracing makes everything more beautiful. A game like Battlefield V already looks beautiful, but when raytracing is enabled it looks even better. Voxophones contextualizes your perspective while playing the game, the story is great, but these audio logs make it perfect. As I collected Voxophones, there were “OHHHH ♥♥♥♥!”, and “SO THAT’S WHY!” moments. It's so refreshing to have these moments sprinkled throughout the game. There was one instance wherein a new character is introduced, and I don’t have a clue of who this person is. As the game progressed, I collected Voxophones that introduced who this character is and what happened. The recordings showed humanity in these people, their motivation, their thoughts. It showed a glimpse of the why in their actions. Which enriches the cutscenes and set pieces more. The voice work in this is amazing, from minor rants to grand statements. They convey emotion in their voice for both when you see the characters, and in Voxophones. THERE’S ALWAYS A VERDICT Bioshock Infinite is a game that has amazing storytelling, great combat, and rewarding exploration. I was emotionally invested through its up and downs.

76561198047132031,3,Assassin's Creed® Revelations,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"9/10 For AC Fans : Recommended For Story-Driven Games Fans : Recommended For 3rd Person Action-Adventure Games Fans : Recommended For Others : Recommended. This is the most mature (gameplaywise) among the Ezio-Trilogy of games and it holds-up in 2020. The same can be said for the graphics, it still looks great this 2020. Assassin’s Creed: Revelations is a game that keeps what the series has been good at, and builds on top of it: Nice Story Badass protagonist Great world building The right amount of side tasks. It’s a game that kept me engaged throughout its 29-hour stay (90%). Combining great storytelling with new features like the Hook-blade, an assortment of bombs, and Eagle sense. Ezio Auditore da Firenze is in its most enjoyable, relatable, and badass state ever! EZIO OUT OF WATER! The game puts you in the time where Ezio has matured in his life as an assassin. Experiencing so much during his lifetime, questions come up more than answers. As an action, he embarks on a journey in search of more of these answers. The amazing thing I felt during this journey is the sense of Ezio being “out-of-water”. The world-building is superb. Though it still has many mechanics inherited from AC: Brotherhood like Factions, Banks, Doctors, buying merchants, buying landmarks, and many more. It still felt like a different place because people and buildings look vastly different. Also, the setting sounds different. From the murmurings of the crowd, their accents, to their responses when interacted to. This feeling was further given emphasis when introducing new mechanics. It shows how assassins in Roma is different in technology compared to assassins in Constantinople. One example would be the introduction of different bomb types. When showed a bomb, Ezio responds with something like “how can a smoke bomb work in this situation?” and received a reply in the lines of “No no Ezio, this is no ordinary smoke bomb….”. Those are nice touches that add to the experience, it shows that even a master assassin can be shown new stuff. GAME DIFFICULTY OR EZIO IS JUST TOO OP During combat sequences, I felt the same combat feel in AC: Brotherhood. Wherein Ezio can kill anybody instantly, and the same goes for your assassin friends. Back in AC: Brotherhood, this made me take decisions differently like not finding the best gear, and not trying new strategies at all. Because I was too overpowered, I never really bothered with changing up anything player-power-wise. The same goes for AC: Revelations. Combat for this game was a tough cookie to try and give a positive or negative rating on. Because on one hand, I like games that challenge me, which this game did not (except to get optional objectives), this is the reason I always play games on the hardest difficulty. But on the other hand, I am rooting for Ezio to be this badass master assassin that can kill anyone with ease. If I was not aiming to get all optional objectives, this would be a much shorter game because of Ezio having the combat prowess of a god. And this is my fear, especially for the next AC games. Currently, I’m willing to give AC: Revelations a positive for combat because I’m rooting for Ezio to be the most badass character he can be, and I am sold on that fantasy. I think the reason for this bias is the story. THE STORY AND EZIO’S RELATABILITY The story in this game is great. This was not a masterpiece by any stretch, because there were eye-rolling times like “how the in the world did that happen” or “Really… REALLY?” The reason it was great is that you now see more parts of Ezio. I won’t spoil anything. But what I can tell you is that this Ezio is a more mature and fleshed-out character compared to AC: Brotherhood. This is the most relatable Ezio has ever been compared to the previous two games. I can see that this is the source of my positive bias towards this game. I like the story. The world-building and its characters support it. OH DESMOND, I DIDN’T KNOW YOU WERE THERE. I was so invested in Ezio’s story, that I never really bothered with Desmond’s. There are levels you can play in Animus Island as Desmond. Oh…. I feel so sad I haven’t gotten to play them…. NOT. It looks like this is a testament as to how I was so disconnected with Desmond sequences that I start to now understand the comments that say, “Assassin’s Creed games should not have these present-day lore sequences anymore”. And I kind of agree. VERDICT Assassin’s Creed: Revelations is a game that has a strong emphasis on Ezio’s story, gameplay mechanics that hits more than it misses, and quality-of-life changes that made the experience more seamless. The improvements it made over its predecessor is a big plus. While being able to introduce new features that made it more fun, but on rare occasions, it didn’t. I never imagined I would be this engaged with the game’s story, but it’s a testament to how good it is. For Full Review [martopad.medium.com]",29.0 hrs on record,N/A

In theory I'm the target market for it, and there is a fun game buried somewhere inside, but honestly, it's just kind of meh. The controls and game mechanics are clunky and borderline buggy at times. The para glider sucks and is too hard to control. The parkour doesn't feel smooth. The characters aren't all that likeable. There's more clipping through walls or sticking to walls or falling through floors than there should be in a game like this. I kept playing it because I felt at some point it should get fun, but 25 hours in I've kind of given up. I couldn't recommend this game unless it's on deep special and you really have nothing else to play. Update: I did eventually finish the game out of boredom. No, I don't regret anything I wrote in my original review, only to add that the final boss fight is probably the lamest I've encountered in a game for many years and just as buggy as the rest of the game, even after all these years.",34.1 hrs on record,N/A
76561198165372229,1,Kingdom Come: Deliverance II,"Action, Adventure, RPG",Recommended,"If you liked the first game, you're almost guaranteed to like this one. It is very similar, but does everything just a little better. That said, there are plenty of bugs if you don't just play the main story, and I've come across some in the main story also. I'm sure when the first giant patch is released a lot of the issues will get fixed and most aren't game breaking anyway. Like the first game, this isn't for everyone. Your character takes time to level up and is bad at most things initially. The game is relatively slow paced and at times filled with exposition, and there are parts even I don't like, like the parts where you don't play as Henry. All in all, if you're looking to be immersed in a medieval world, where life moves a bit more slowly, and where you can grind away at improving your skills until you become a tank, this game is for you. If you played the first game and found enjoyment in it, but thought some of the quests were really lame, this one takes most of what you loved from the first game and likely gets rid of most of what you didn't. I've put 90 hours into it by now, and I'm sure I can easily put another 20 hours into it. If there's a third chapter in Henry's story, I'll no-doubt get that one too, and I'd hope the improvement is similar now that the study has a real budget. I enjoy your games!

While RDR 2 improves on this game in every single way, this is still a great game and worth playing. It starts out slow, and there's lots of boring missions in the beginning, but the story gets going and has many great cinematic moments that clearly served as inspirations for the 2nd game. If you enjoyed RDR 2 but couldn't get into this because of the slow cattle wrangling and horse breaking missions early on, just push through that part.

Not only was the game play compelling, but the games held up pretty well. I enjoyed both of them. As good as the first two are, this third one is a compelling and beautiful game. They went for a more open-world feel, and built a really immersive and compelling world and story. I was drawn into the world of this game in ways that are rare. Visually beautiful, with a strong narrative, and fun combat. Just really an amazing game that I wish I had played earlier. One of the best single player games in existence.",21.8 hrs on record,N/A

76561198165372229,1,RoboCop: Rogue City,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"First to be critical: a flawed, somewhat outdated looking game (in terms of the models and animations). I found quite a few bugs as well, with heads turning around 180 degrees, falling through the floor or clipping through walls a few times, or things not activating. The game crashed on me numerous times, despite high end hardware, and takes ages to build its shaders, causing it to be laggy the first minute or so of play. The skills, besides the combat based ones, mostly don't serve  purpose and you can get away with not upgrading any of them if you wanted to. You feel a bit overpowered as well, by the end of the game if you upgraded your armour and combat abilities and kitted your gun with the right mods, you can kill hundreds of enemies. The world feels empty, there isn't much to do outside the main missions. It's supposed to be a big crowded city but it feels basically abandoned. Small town on a Sunday vibes. All that said, still play it! It's fun to be RoboCop. For all its flaws, the game still somehow manages to be fun to play. This isn't the greatest game ever, but it is a fun one, especially if you're more on the casual side.

If I had known the latter I would never have bought it to begin with, but it's not that that made me stop playing. Right off the bat it's clearly VERY inspired by Bioshock, and reminded me a lot of Infinite. Except with terrible voice acting, a world where everyone calls you Comrade, and clunky pacing. For reference, I liked the Bioshock and Wolfenstein games. I saw some of the reviews comparing this to those, which is mainly why I bought it. It does remind me of those, but not in a good way. It's like Wolfenstein, but unaware of its irony, and Bioshock, but without everything that makes it good. Just my opinion. If you don't mind the FSB having your data, playing a game that possibly funds the war in Ukraine, and playing a game inferior to all its inspiration, then go ahead.

76561198165372229,1,The Callisto Protocol™,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"Feels clunky and not very fun. The opening sequence is alright, and the graphics are quite good. The story is meh. It's definitely not as good a game as Deadspace was. The enemies are kinda predictable: if you walk near a vent or crack in the wall, after a while you just know something is going to pop out. The combat is boring as hell and very poorly implemented. Fighting multiple enemies is a mess, switching weapon a pain in the arse, and the dodge mechanic doesn't feel like it works right. Weapons aren't that fun to use. Most of the game involves throwing enemies with the GRP glove or bashing them with a stick. There is a crazy ramp up in difficulty during and after the platform sequence (you'll know it when you reach it), and some really poor choices in auto save points, causing you to have to re-purchase the same upgrades and sell the same loots dozens of times in some cases just to die in a fight and have to do it again. Death scenes and other animations are a bit too long and can get annoying real quick. Manual saves don't work as you'd expect them to, but rather just serve as alternative checkpoint saves, so serve almost no purpose (I didn't load a manual save other than the test how it works). It's mostly so you can create your own ""chapters"" to replay later if you want, but the game actually has very little replayability since there's no real variation in anything. You'll be stuck seeing the same cut-scenes, using the same weapons, and using the same fighting strategies. All-in-all a disappointing game, given the beautiful graphics and environments the artists created. You can see a lot of love, blood, sweat, and tears went into the game, and it's a real shame it just didn't come together into something really amazing. I'd still give it a 6 / 10.

It feels like they started developing a fun game and were then told to hurry along and finish it. Evertything from the race onwards feels honestly, meh, and rushed. Even before that, the map is tiny.

I don't like the guerrilla war nature of it, and would have preferred something more like Terror from the Deep or a continuation of the previous XCOM game. I also don't like that it kinda feels like the previous game didn't matter, that after you rescue the world from the first invasion somehow everyone on the council decided to side with the aliens. I don't want to fight an earth based threat against other people and shape shifters, I want to straight up fight aliens. I also dislike the events and how chatty the game is, there are constant interruptions from talking heads that I couldn't be arsed to care about. I just want to play and be immersed in the battle. The music also distracts from, rather than adds to, the atmosphere in my opinion.

The story is intruiging and the score is good, but the game feels slow, short, dialog is poor and the voice acting wooden, the characters are mostly unlikeable (at least to me) - with your cliche strong female knowit-all, army commander type, and hard headed German scientist, and many of the puzzles are frustrating not because they're hard (as many claim) but rather because they don't make sense and there's very little chance anyone would stumble on the solution intuitively (I'd say about 40-50% fall in this category).

While the game engine is great and the graphics pretty, the story isn't all that compelling and the combat and Nemesis system that everyone else seems to think is awesome bored the living daylights out of me. Battles stretch on forever; tedious affairs where you roll and jump around while being interrupted the whole time by new captains giving you speeches about how cool they are. Get ready to die often, especially at the beginning when you haven't levelled and you don't know the game, mostly because everything is poorly explained. The game is basically Assassin's Creed set in Mordor, which should be fun, except it just isn't for some reason. Enemies respawn too quickly and too often making battles dull, areas you clean out don't stay clean making the accomplishment feel pointless.

There is nothing original or interesting about the plot or game mechanics, it's essentially Baldur's Gate 2 with more fighting and bugs.

76561198165372229,3,Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"I'm part of the small minority that don't think this game is the best in the series. In fact, I don't even think it should be called Assassin's Creed. Black Flag feels like Ubisoft started to create a pirate game, and then halfway through decided that it should be an Assassin's Creed game instead, so they tacked on a few Templar related elements. I've played Asssassin's Creed 1, 2, Brotherhood, Revalations, and 3 before this one. So I am familiar with the lore of the game and what I enjoyed in the series. For me the wheels came off with the terrible protagonist Conor in 3. Assassin's Creed 3 and 4 both feel disjointed to me, and disconnected from the Assassin roots. Somehow the games have become less and less about finding out about the history of the Assassin's and their struggle with the Templars, and more about individual characters that just fall into the organization by chance. The game looks fine, the naval warfare from 3 is back and has been expanded upon greatly - so much so that it makes out a giant chunk of the game so if you didn't enjoy that aspect give this a skip - and combat works well enough, but for me this game is just missing something. Like the core of the game somehow went lost in translation. I don't much care for Conor or Edward, and the stealth element has been almost completely removed from this game as well as (to a lesser extent) its predecessor. In many cases you will be faced with scenario where stealth either isn't possible, or you don't have time to deal with it. The game encourages full frontal attacks in which you endlessly counter attack until heaps of bodies surround you. Perhaps if this was a completely separate game with a different story line I could have enjoyed it, but as an Assasin's Creed game I have to say that I'm disappointed, especially given the extremely hyperbolic reviews I've read. 6/10.",2.8 hrs on record,N/A
76561198165372229,3,South Park™: The Stick of Truth™,"Action, Adventure, RPG",Recommended,"I am a fan of the TV series. I have to honestly say that I didn't think this game was as great as many other people did. Sure, I laughed a few times, and it felt a lot like an interactive episode of the show, but personally I didn't find it as funny or the gameplay as compelling as others did. Regardless I recommend the game to fans of South Park as there are many throwbacks to episodes and some fun to be had. I can't say that the game felt unfinished or rushed at all and only experienced one bug. Graphics and audio is exactly the same as the TV show. It is labeled an RPG but it feels more like an adventure game to me with RPG elements added on. Think a dumbed down version of something like Day of the Tentacle where you can also upgrade your character. Worth a play for fans of the TV show, or if you're just curious, but if you are easily offended then you should probably stay clear. 7/10.",13.3 hrs on record,N/A
76561198165372229,3,Tomb Raider,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"Let me start by saying that I am not a fan of Tomb Raider. I played the original games years ago and found them boring. I only bought this title because I was bored, feeling nostalgic, and it was on special. I only mention this because, if anything, I had a slightly negative bias against this game; I was expecting it to suck, and boy was I wrong. Tomb Raider properly reboots the franchise. It is a larger than life adventure filled with some fun environments to explore and a lot of action packed sequences. The game was clearly built for console, and this comes across in the number of qte's that appear throughout, but if you can stomach that I can wholeheartedly recommend Tomb Raider as a very entertaining experience in the same vein as the Uncharted series. Graphics are surprisingly good, and the voice acting reasonably solid. I'd estimate the average person would get 10-15 hours of play time. 8 / 10.",14.1 hrs on record																					(1.8 hrs at review time),N/A

Interesting characters, captivating story, intuitive and creative gameplay mechanics, this has it all. Some might not like the watercolour look of the graphics, and the voice acting is flat at times, but this game manages to balance everything perfectly. I got 13 hours of play from it, taking a stealth approach to the game and exploring the world. If you rush through from objective to objective you might finish it in half that, and if you go for achievements and all the upgrades you'll probably finish in twice that.

Apparently, this is due to the fact I was playing on Master difficulty. People like to spread a misconception that Master difficulty is the correct first time difficulty, saying that enemies are easier to kill, there are less glitches, and that it is tradition. What master difficulty actually does is make the game harder, just like it is supposed to. The game is great, the story, characters, graphical design, atmosphere: all great. However, putting the game on Master difficulty in the early game will ruin the game, so just please listen to me, and do not listen to anybody that tells you to play on Master. Early on, you have horrible weapons, no gear, and limited resources. An experienced player will be able to go through the first part of the game on Master, but that is because they know how to play the game. A newcomer should play on normal so they can learn the game mechanics, and once they get better gear and are confident, they should raise the difficulty to Master.",50.9 hrs on record																					(20.8 hrs at review time),N/A

It has become one of my favorite games of all time. Gameplay: 8/10 What really makes this entry stand apart from the other games is it's sandbox nature. It plays a lot more like a Just Cause game, giving you a lot of freedom to just ♥♥♥♥ around. If you like the Just Cause series, I would say play this game. Content: 10/10 I have 34 hours, and have done only about 10-20 of the 137 missions. I have also hardly done any outposts. The game has a lot of content, so you will definitely be getting your money's worth. There is also the Arcade, which has countless levels to play, and the co-op experience, and co-op in a game pretty much doubles the amount of hours you can get out of a game. There is also a New Game+ difficulty, and you can also turn of the hud to create a whole new game experience. It is near impossible to run out of things to do. Graphics: 10/10 The graphics are insane. I would say this is the best looking game set in modern times. If you activate HD textures, you could take screenshots probably anywhere and people wouldn't know it was a game. Story: 6/10 Story is... Ok? I didn't really get this game for the story, I got this game for the gameplay. If story is everything, not the game for you. In my opinion everything else in this game is way too good to not play just because of the mediocre story. Should you buy it?
