76561197996907347,1,The Slormancer,Recommended,"The Slormancer nails the addictive ARPG loop with fast, satisfying combat and a ridiculous amount of build variety. Its flexible skill system and the ability to swap classes or rework your entire build at any time make experimentation effortless and rewarding. For the price, the depth and polish here are outstanding. Easily one of the best value-for-dollar indie ARPGs out there.",13.7 hrs on record																					(8.2 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197996907347,1,Into the Restless Ruins,Recommended,"Into the Restless Ruin really surprised me. The core loop of building the dungeon, uncovering the seals, and beating the boss is tight and super satisfying. I wasn’t sure about the auto attack at first, but it turns out it’s a total lifesaver, letting me focus on dodging and positioning instead of frantic clicking. It all comes together in a way that’s both strategic and fast-paced. Definitely worth checking out.",2.7 hrs on record																					(1.7 hrs at review time),N/A

76561197996907347,2,Railway Empire 2,Recommended,"Railway Empire 2 is a stellar sequel that surpasses its predecessor in nearly every aspect. This railway management game is great, featuring an array of quality of life improvements that enhance the overall gameplay experience (and manual switching coming soon!). The developers have clearly listened to feedback, as the game feels polished and bug-free after the latest patch. The game's one more turn nature (well, it's real-time... you get what I mean) makes it easy to lose track of time.

76561197996907347,2,Middle-earth™: Shadow of War™,Recommended,Great game. Holds up well even five years after release. Nothing like spending an hour or two killing some orcs. Also plays great on the Steam Deck with little customization (although I'd recommend medium settings on 40 fps and refresh rate for battery life).,48.5 hrs on record																					(43.7 hrs at review time),N/A

UPDATE 6/16/2018: -------------------------------------------------------------- Unfortunately, I can no longer recommend the game in it's current state.
