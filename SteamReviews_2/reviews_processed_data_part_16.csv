Doing the almighty bullet dodge, sideways, off a boat and falling to your death. 7. This is my favourite. Most likely the one of the last shots you have to take in the game.

Narrative style for the campaign can be text book level for this genre. Plus, this game can be the manliest game ever in the most positive way, you can feel the epicenes at a lot of scenes. Only problem was the last boss’ design (AI was problematic at high difficulty also) for some attacks. Also, game supports co-op at campaign and operations. Other than that, PVP is pretty decent with matches that you can easily find. Even though this is AAA, it is not overpriced like most of the AAA games.

The puzzles were more like chill game puzzles that were designed differently. After finishing other games, I wanted to play from the other side. However, I did not care about it this time, since the other side was obvious or can be seen from my side. Also, ending was a bit lacklustre and wasn’t enough for an end to series.

76561198037246903,1,N/A,Recommended,"I had high hopes for this game. However, it was a total bust. Only a couple of choices matters throughout the game and story does not make sense at all. Main character treats her other half like ♥♥♥♥, while game forces you to make ♥♥♥♥♥♥ choices. All of the characters, including the main character, are ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Only black guy seems decent but it does not have enough screen time. All of the romance options feel forced sadly. Especially the agent one which game forces you to play a chapter to go on a date with him out of nowhere. Also, this is the biggest grooming in gaming history, and for some reason it is okay in this game. All of the relations are about the same in this game: After a couple of days, you can be with the Indian guy, again there is not even a one moment of intimacy before that. Similar with homeless people, you spend some time with them and they trust you with everything. The main character says all of the men to leave the burning building and they all do without a hesitation, while all of their friends and a baby in that building. By the way, they do not even know your powers. The game is full of these kinds of idiotic moments, definitely does not worth your time.",35.9 hrs on record,N/A

Guess what? Ranked is full of hackers and Valve is taking money for a game that was free before. For some reason, this game has one of the highest cheater ratio and developers do not care. Weirdly, you cannot gift prime status. Other than there is a gambling part which is aimed at children and used at money laundering. 10-15 years ago, Valve and their games meant something different, right now they are just greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Also, there are lots of alternatives for these kinds of shooters, one being Valorant which is free.",74.5 hrs on record,N/A
76561198037246903,1,N/A,Recommended,"I would not recommend this game at full price but it has great discount value at sales. So, this review is for the discounted price. As a rogue-lite, game is pretty simple and honestly, a bit repetitive. However, selling items at the shop is a great idea and makes game much more enjoyable. I would expect more upgrades or features to the store but there isn’t much. Still, the shop aspect is decent and was the most important part of the game for me. Other than that, art style with simple aesthetics suits well to the game’s atmosphere. There isn’t much for story or NPCs but I would not expect much from a rogue-lite. The most important part for a rogue-lite would be the gameplay. Play style, items and upgrades are a bit straight forward, they are pretty simple and a bit clunky at the same time. Therefore, it is not great but not that bad. Game has some questionable choices like bosses that can be killed once, armors that gives speed (it does not give much speed) instead of higher armor rating, useless weapons types, etc. Because of these reasons, I think this is a great game for its discounted price and a mediocre game for the full price.",76.1 hrs on record,N/A
76561198037246903,1,N/A,Recommended,"Contrary to the base game, this DLC just feels hollow. Most of the enemies are from the base game but they have much higher hp (they have a lot of hp sadly) and damage. New enemies are mostly annoying with their item steal abilities and mace wielder’s annoying attack pattern. Game becomes much bigger grind than the main game with annoying rare items for upgrades, useless special weapons and expensive (different currency that resets at every time you leave the dungeon) elevator system. For some reason, developers thought adding old cheap items is a good idea but it only forces you to constantly arrange your inventory. For some reason, there is no upgrade to the shop which is weird, since it is main theme of the game. Also, there is a new system for limited item trade (some rare items can only be purchased this way) and haggle which is another grindy aspect. Sadly, DLC was only a repetitive and grindy experience that I wasn’t able to enjoy.",0.0 hrs on record,N/A

76561198037246903,2,N/A,Recommended,"Normally, I despise Borderlands games, because of its “story”, annoying and cringing writing or dialogues and repetitive gameplay. However, this game has great writing, character development and soundtrack, while having a well-matched world with tiny references to the other games of Borderlands.

Watching someone play makes you think these puzzles are pretty easy but you can see the perfect design for this kind of game, when you play the game.

76561198037246903,2,N/A,Recommended,"It’s a free decent PVP shooter game like Overwatch, probably better than Overwatch. There are only two things I did not like about the game: First one was the team balance, most games are easy wins or loses, balanced matches are rare. The second one is the GPU crashes. Unfortunately, it is pretty common. Still, it is free, have a variety of characters with different skill sets and it could be easily enjoyable, if you like these kinds of games.

76561198037246903,2,N/A,Recommended,"This is one of the games that I am in-between. I think the reason that I recommend this game is the decent price of the game and developers having courage to try something new, even though the old formula was perfect. The Positive Graphics, soundtrack and the atmosphere are great once again. Building mechanics are different but not bad (except finding certain buildings). There are lots of new mechanics, laws and technologies to explore. Plus, this game is another challenge to survive. The Negative New mechanics change the feeling of the game sadly. First game was a battle between life and death, making you feel responsible for people and care about them. The political aspect of the game makes you annoyed only. You are at the brink of extinction but what’s that? There is a protest at the most vital place and if you did not pass the law, you can only send the faction who favours you or grant the law they want but again if the other factions do not want that law, you are pretty much tied. Contrary to first game, events are pretty similar to sandbox and there aren’t much unique encounters to see. Other than that, map exploration is boring and there isn’t anything that exciting or improving the lore.",44.9 hrs on record,N/A
76561198037246903,2,N/A,Recommended,"As you can see easily, it has a great art style and terrific atmosphere. This game tells about grief with symbolism and does a great job with it.

76561198037246903,2,N/A,Recommended,"Even though graphics are nice and atmosphere is relaxing with decent soundtrack, game feels a bit dull. It needs a lot of micro management with production chain sadly. You can only set a number to produce, not a limit according to your stocks. Similar situation with the people, if you lose working people or their equipment, it is not easy to keep track. Because of the color palette, some of the buildings are similar also. Other than that, raids feel tiresome (sometimes you are being attacked constantly) and they are not levelled as the distance which means you can get raided by strong enemy near your base. After you get your economy going, it really goes without doing much which makes it boring around mid-game. Lastly, relations with other factions are a bit weak, since you cannot do anything other than trade. To sum up, I think this game might have potential but it has a long road and right now, it is too expensive.",23.5 hrs on record,N/A
76561198037246903,2,N/A,Recommended,"Pretty enjoyable game, especially with friends. Weirdly, it supports 16 people and it is much more than most co-op games. Invitation system at Steam is broken but you can join from the game by the host’s name. Although, the graphics are very old (animations are funny at least) and the gameplay is simple, this game is both enjoyable and relaxing experience (a bit stressful at the beginning). Since there is no clear direction, you have to find some of the things by trying like using numpad or placement controls. Another enjoyable part is the broom mechanic. Plus, this game gets updates which was a surprise for me, since it is free. Definitely, I recommend this game.",71.1 hrs on record																					(49.6 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198037246903,2,N/A,Recommended,"I was a bit in between for this review. Even though, the gameplay features were decent and the world of Deus Ex interesting, comparing this one to Human Revolution, I do not think that this game is sufficient to be a good one. First of all, it feels rushed. There aren’t any decent choices at the end, the story seems like half-done for DLCs but DLCs are irrelevant, while being lackluster. There are some good missions still but it is not enough, since the main missions are not exciting for the most part. Characters and writing are not bad but again, it is obviously not finished. Because of that you feel a bit frustrated at the end. For some reason ending scene is after the first part of the credits which is not skippable. Normally, it would not be a problem but credits are almost 20 minutes long and if you replay the ending, again you cannot skip it. There is a bug that makes your game crash, trying to exit the gun range. However, this is a very simple bug that can be easily fixed by developers. Unfortunately, they did not care about it also, it is there for a long time. This one is not a huge problem by itself but again, it shows that developers did not care enough. Another problem is micro transactions in a single player game which is not okay for me. It is especially for Breach (it is not a very player friendly system and obviously it is intentional.) For some reason they added a DLC that gives you some items but only once. What a great DLC! At least it is free. Other than that, there are some triangles for you to find and scan the barcode to receive something extra. This is one of the worst ideas I’ve ever heard. However, I do not have to use it, so it should not be a problem at that part. Lastly, this game includes a DLC named Breach that makes you go into VR mode hacking. Sadly, it is pretty boring and repetitive. There isn’t much story, other than the files you have recovered. However, they are pretty boring and a genius thought waiting for the messages is a good idea. Buying everything via box system another annoying feature of this DLC’s. You cannot purchase the guns directly; you have to purchase a box and open it. Yes, this system of a singleplayer game. In conclusion, this game had some potential but sadly it isn’t planned or executed well enough. It will be always in the shadow of Human Revolution. At least it has a decent price at sales.",99.9 hrs on record,N/A

There are not much new features for this DLC to be worth your money. Story of the game is pretty irrelevant to main game. For some reason, you have to go into a prison as a prisoner to reach an agent (being a visitor or guardian is too much I guess). On paper, second part is interesting but it is not really different gameplaywise; probably the reason is the length of this DLC. Sadly, you need DLCs for achievements.",0.0 hrs on record,N/A

First of all, it has a great writing with conversations, characters, narrative/thought process and opening point. Even though, the story’s opening point is original, it was a bit annoying for me, since I did not want to be that guy. However, as the story processed, “my” character became much more interesting with the events unfolding, while choosing the backstory for him. Honestly, I had trouble finishing the game, probably because there is not much gameplay, other than the conversation choices. Even with that problem, I think this game deserves playing, even if you have a problem like me. I think there are problems at the developers’ studio about ownership and the original creators were forced to quit. I would be cautious of the studios new games but I would recommend this one. Lastly, the art style and music direction in game are pretty good too. I would advise not missing the karaoke scene and buying the game from sales, since it has a great price at sales.",79.6 hrs on record,N/A

However, game is a bit repetitive and after a while, your main occupation is resource gathering, maybe automating. As you can guess, that part is pretty boring. Sadly, there are also a lot of bugs and controls are not great, especially flatting the terrain. Definitely, I would not play this game solo but as I said before, it is enjoyable with friends. Also, developers added a lot of free content as missions and new items but I do not think they are implemented well or have great mechanics (other than aliens). Another negative point is having no option for base building as other games. I think this system aims to be practical only, there is not much to design for appearance.

However, there are only 2 main maps to explore which is not much. Similar to that, there are only 3 species of animals and 3 subspecies of those animals which again it is not much. You can see the questionable game design decisions all over the game like not be able to unlock any clothes without paying, similar and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ clothes, overpriced items (both in game and in real life), temple of gales (it was a pain in the ass and bugged at the same time), an NPC design that does not leave her room for some reason, annoying chappa chase game (since there are too many players at the same server, you cannot even get the animals). Sadly, there aren’t many quests and some of them appears after developing your relationship with a villager. The world is interesting but very limited at the same time. Game is around for some time but it did not develop as much. As far as I know, some of the game crew was fired which can explain the really slow development with lots of problems. Other than that, there are a lot of bugs like chat going for a day, invisible gliders and bugged cliffs. Unfortunately, there isn’t much to do with your friends (you cannot share items directly) but the community is pretty decent and well mannered. All of these problems I mentioned were not a huge annoyance for me but making a lot of things very rare and making some items really expensive was the last straw for me. Acquiring the shiny fishes and bugs were pain in the ass (it took me 300 hours by the way) but acquiring the makeshift items were worse than that, because you are able to catch the same item over and over again. However, the worst of the worst was opening oysters for a stone to give to an NPC for achievement. I had to open 1000 of them and there was nothing.  You have to run around and gather these things which is a dull and time-consuming activity. After that I have checked the discussions, and saw that it was a chronic problem with lots of variations. Since I am an achievement hunter, I did try all of these things and it will take more than 300 hours of yours if you try to achieve everything. Unfortunately acquiring these are not near any fun, it is just a chore and excuse for longer playtime. Normally, I do try not give a thumbs down for free games but I do not have any hope for this game and I think it will die out after some while.",302.3 hrs on record,N/A
76561198037246903,3,N/A,Recommended,"I had huge expectations for this game, since the first one is one of my favorite games. However, I had to be reminded by the game that expecting anything from someone else will only break your heart. Sadly, this game is just a shell. It will be one of the prettiest things you have ever seen; great acting, especially for the protagonist, good sound design (decent music integration also) and that’s about it. There is nothing else positive other than these. You will miss the first game at every step that you take at this game and there will be lots of steps, since there is nothing to do other than walking. There is a funny thing about this game though: The ratings it has received. Weirdly rating charts that has shared at the game page shows this game as a perfect or near perfect game. It cannot be farther from that. Let’s get the negatives and reason why I was saddened by this game. I will start with the small things and will get to the important ones later. -	First of all, thank you for Turkish translation but there are also a couple of mistakes, at least it is not ♥♥♥♥♥♥ like most Turkish translations at games. However, it needs a much better proofreading and it shows that the translator does not know or played the game. -	For some reason you cannot skip the cutscenes and you have to watch them, if you replay it. I had to replay it for a collectible by the way. -	The first game had amazing lore stone story about Baldur. This one is a pretty boring in every aspect. I did forget this one immediately. Also, there are some trees as collectibles which say a couple of sentences that you are not going to care. -	One of the worst things about this game is the gameplay. The puzzles are just an excuse for you to walk around and does not add anything to the story. There is combat but honestly it is not even combat. You just press two or three buttons with a locked camera, while fighting the same enemies one by one. The first game’s combat was simple but at least it was decent. This one is just a joke. Also, there are no boss fights, horrors that you have felt at the first game or anything that will make you feel that you are really interacting. -	The last of the problems is the story. The first game had a great story with a twist and double entendre storytelling style. You weren’t able to differentiate what is real or not and that was not important. Because it was real and not in her head at the same time. Plus, the voices in her head had a meaning. Right now, those voices only backseat, there is no narrative reason for them to be there. I wanted to hear them at this game, arguing in her head, mixing her head or showing the process of decision making but this feature was much weaker than I expected. There are some symbols for this story also but they are just there to be there. The symbolism at this game feels like a pretentious art student’s unfinished work. They are just an example of usage of symbols, if they weren’t there, nothing would have changed. Another point is reality, it is not mixed anymore, it is just a magical world which Senua has some magical powers and wisdom. Sadly, the story is a simple action story with boring and cliche characters. The story was so bad that I had to pray that Senua not falling in love with the blond as a symbolism of “tortured man”/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ archetype at romantic comedies. At least it did not happen. However, Senua does not mention Dillion, the person for whom she literally and figuratively gone to hell. Healing does not mean forgetting someone ever existed but of course no one will know that in modern world. To sum up, this game is just a shell without a decent story or gameplay. Do not even try; if you are curious watch some gameplay videos since there is no gameplay.",9.5 hrs on record,N/A

However, the balance is far from being decent. Some of the buildings or systems are a bit useless (like outposts), especially with the dome requirements. Sadly, if some of your people die, your resource income will be dreadfully affected. Therefore, your economy will collapse with a domino effect. For some reason, there is a time limit for end game which is not fun and events are not really interesting. Unfortunately, some of the systems do not work properly like transporter belts or roads, while there isn’t much need for them with time limitation. Other than that research tree is a bit annoying with instant research and proceeding too quick that you cannot build the previous systems, before unlocking new technologies. One of the most annoying things for me was the tutorial. There is no real tutorial for complex systems, only videos which I hate. I am not going to study some videos to learn the game and if I wanted to do that I would do it via professional/psychotic players to learn the most efficient systems.

76561198037246903,4,N/A,Recommended,"This game seems promising but definitely does not live up to the point. Firstly, most of the things is not explained, like item levels or sicknesses, you cannot even find any information at the help section. Even though core gameplay isn’t bad, DLCs make it much worse with a lot of combat or micro management. Also, they are half done. You can find the review of the DLCs below. In relation to that, new raider or blight creatures at the map are plain annoying. You get constant attacks from the raiders and other creatures at the map or your settlement. You can see that the game is half finished and not cared about. First implication of this is seeing half of the resource names being broken at the top bar. Then, you notice you cannot upgrade the roads automatically; clicking is hard sometimes, if your specialist is near the target; sometimes people not going to the hospital or eat food, you cannot control or slow down the births, while some of the warnings being misleading (like stock is full or someone is malnourished). If you save and load you can get rid of these fake warnings at least. After that, you notice that your pc with liquid cooling system is burning (top of the line games do not have this effect) and you find out that even the best computers are in the same situation. The reason for that developers promising that they will optimize the games 3 years ago and did not care at all. With that, you can see that the game is abandoned for more than 1 year. There were no updates after the last DLC and lot of things are left broken or half-done. Unfortunately, some of the achievements are not unlocked correctly (You have to not be an ally to the last settlement, while maximizing the relations.). Because of this game, I think I am not going to purchase any Paradox game in the future and definitely, I do not recommend this game to anyone. Rebirth An annoying DLC which cancels some of the base game’s monsters (sandworms, some bandits at the settlement), while turning the game an action game. Also, blight buildings are mostly useless. One building allows you to terraform to increase the fertility but it is more like late game thing which will make it too late use. Other buildings are about blight only. Blight makes your game constant combat at map and at your settlement which was the main reason I hated this DLC. Plus, I had to pay more than the base game at sales for this DLC which was another annoying point for me. Forgotten Tracks I got this one with the bundle without even trying the purchase this. However, this is the only decent DLC. Shattered Hope Space rock DLC allows you to overtime your buildings for space rock. However, trying pick the areas again and again is another micro management.  For some reason moon rock makes people work harder. By the way, how the hell the moon is shattered and falling apart piece by piece? It is not even trying to be plausible. Other than that, there is a new happiness-like mechanic named hope which feels like a chore. Because you have to treat the angry people at a new building. Sadly, that building can take 2 patients and for some reason hospitals don’t have psychiatry in this game. Also, you can have feast to give people hope but it is another late game thing (you won’t need it at late game), since it needs a lot of resources. Ultimate Colony Only a short quest which gives you a regular specialist and also unlocks two useless buildings. Radio tower’s only use is to start the quest, Martian wind turbine is just a wind turbine. Plus, there are two skins for flags which is another unnecessary addon. New Alliances A new system that makes the settlements more detailed. It gives some requests to increase the relationship. Weirdly, their only use is trading with them, while relationship status does not change the prices. There are building that you can build to the other settlements but buildings have no real impact. Sadly, alliance or federation do not stop the annoying sabotages as they said. The buildings that can protect you from the sabotages requires manpower with electricity. Also, probably one of them won’t be enough and there 4 different types. So, at least 4x2 buildings and that makes it too much to be viable. Other than that, there is no reason to sabotage other settlements or be their enemies. There are lots of thing to the at the map and since the raiders keep coming with this great DLC, there will be some other things to do.

76561198037246903,8,N/A,Recommended,"Pillar of Eternity is a highly acclaimed game but I have no idea why. I had many problems with the game and I had to force myself to finish the game or explore the world, since it was pretty boring for me. In addition to that, game feels like an old game more than an old-school game. Let me explain that a bit more: Gameplay elements seems a bit obsolete and not implemented well enough. One of the most obvious ones would be the height attack, for some reason my men wasn’t able to do height attacks but enemy were able to attack from above without any problems. Other than that, there are lots of enemies clumped together and combat is pretty dull with the requirement of micromanagement. Since there are lots of encounters and some of the enemies are much stronger than the other ones, while having no indications, you have to do it by trial and error with a lot of backtracking. However, worst part is the enemies’ unlimited spells. I died a lot of time, because of AoE chain ccs. Sadly, even though there are a lot of spells and classes, spells do not feel very different or for some parts useful. Since there is a spell limit per rest for some reason, the combat feels much worse and more like a chore. Plus, the loot from combat is abysmal, experience is minimal. So, there is no real reason to fight. There are some boss fights with dragons for some reason. Even with their huge stats, they have mobs around for you to fight with the dragon and the mob at the same time. Guess what you get, after killing them… Just a couple useless items. Another problem would be the money. I had lots of money at my playthrough, since there was nothing worth buying other than the free DLC content. Weirdly, most of the binded weapons are mediocre. I think they were added to the game and you have to achieve some things to strengthen your weapon but a lot of them are not worth it. Therefore, realising this, after putting some time into it is annoying. Another weird decision is the enchanting system. There is no disenchantment option or getting back the rare ingredients. If this was a 20 years old game, it would not be problem but it is a problem for a modern game. Caed Nua would be another point for being obsolete. Although, Caed Nua management is an interesting system at his core, it feels like it is half-done, especially with the constant bandit raids. It is very tiny and almost have no real impact. Putting the unbalanced difficulty (with weird spikes) with a lot of RNG and no rewards to the mixture makes the gameplay even worse. Lastly, some quests are not explained after development or not updated properly and you get confused, especially if you are playing it time to time. Second most important thing would be the bugs. If you pick two people from the party and try to move them, they cannot go to the place you have clicked for some reason and it seems like they did not care about it at all. Other problems I have encountered are broken interfaces, characters that go invisible (enemies can see them though), until the end of the combat; bugged books that vanishes (I was making a library and tracking the books that I read), bugged audio, weird book font which can change into another font at the same book. Unfortunately, I did encounter all of these bugs during my playthrough over and over again. The third and last thing that I did not like about the game was the writing-story. First of all, contributor stories are the one of the most idiotic elements I have ever seen. There are lots of them, they do not add anything to the story, break the atmosphere by pushing you afar and it is poorly written, while being too short to be interesting and too long to be curious. Apart from that, there are lots to read about the world and the lore; the main idea of reading souls is interesting. However, writing (like an amateur writer from Wattpad), pace, some of the events not being believable, while being contradicting to some other events (no one cares about the things that happened, characters do not care about anything around them other than stealing), weird and pretentious vocabulary decisions, bland and forced narrative style with boring, ever-talking characters that you do not care (also you start to not care about the story very quickly) with the choices that has no real impact on game are making this game a chore. Also, there are a lot of skills and choices at the beginning which overwhelms the player. DLCs make the game a bit better but definitely it is not enough.",210.2 hrs on record,N/A
76561198037246903,8,N/A,Recommended,"This game is a definite no for me. I loved the previous games but this is just bad. Most of the time, you read a wall of text which gives you no useful information and after that you try your luck with your options (there is no logic for regular events). Most of the events are not related to each other and there isn’t much to play. You can manage your staff and budget but it is absurd. Your staff wants raises and if they do not get it, they quit (I am talking more than a million for one person monthly). Since it is mostly reading, you expect the game to have a great writing but it feels a bit smug and annoying. Also, you are forced to be bad person. When I say bad person, I am talking about being a murderer, criminal and etc. and yes, you are the president with that history. So, that means game is not remotely serious but it is not funny at the same. Because of these reasons, I forced myself to play but it is not worth it.

A lot of choices matter and they can affect something in the next game. Be careful with your choices though, if you are not careful, it can lead to some characters’ death. Sadly, game becomes more like an action game (3rd one) as mechanics and it is not a great game as these mechanics. Especially with balance of Citadel DLC or the annoying cover system (it is poorly designed).  Since there are some time-based missions at the series and you won’t be expecting them, I would recommend checking the missions first.

76561198037246903,8,N/A,Recommended,"This game was a pain for the most parts, because of a lot of annoying bugs and having one of the laziest designs I’ve ever seen. Firstly, the bugs: There are a lot of annoying bugs which destroy the gameplay experience. DLC character can break your game and corrupt your save files but happily that was not the case for me, because I was not able to make the DLCs work (tried for hours). Other than being ripped by EA, there are lots of other bugs. There are some bugs with the quests which you need to be careful, crashes and most importantly combat bugs. Occasionally the ranged characters you do not control can run towards walls or standing there without doing anything, if you commanded them to hold ground. This brings us to gameplay: As you can see, game feels like a MMO with boring and repetitive combat. AI of the companions are really bad. Most of the time your ranged characters will run towards enemy melee characters to attack other enemies and as I said before, if you make them hold the ground, they will wait without doing anything. Plus, changing the target is useless as the character will change it again. Also, AoE attacks can hurt your team more than enemies which makes them a lot weaker. You have to disable auto control for those spells and micro manage your team for the most part. Upgrading the gear of your companions is really limited and a bit weak, while the loot is pretty much useless other than selling. Harder difficulty is a chore with sponge enemies who come in numbers but that is that the real problem with the combat. First problem is enemy strength, assassins and mages can easily one-shot your range characters, especially mages can one-shot your backline. Sadly, your spells are pretty weak, when you compare yours to theirs. The second and the most annoying thing is the wave and ambush aspect. You have to beat the waves of enemies but every wave is an ambush. Most of the time, enemies will be spawned on your mages and since there are multiple spawn points, you will have to pull enemies to other areas. Even though story is decent with some interesting characters, the choices can be annoying for sometimes (especially being locked out into a romance without warning the player). Weirdly, templars do not care about me being a mage, while the ending of the game makes you want to hit your head through the walls. First enchanter resorts to the blood magic for no reason and he becomes a demon which forces you to kill him, after killing the templars (not before). Although there isn’t much details, there are a lot of the usage of the same areas. I mean, I do not care for using the same areas normally but this is another level. The same areas have been used over and over again without any changes. Graphics are pretty old but playable. For some reason this game is 30 USD.

76561198037246903,9,N/A,Recommended,"This game was an absolute nightmare for me. You can find the reasons below with details. Game has really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat: Bad hitboxes, attacks that can go through enemy; getting hit, even if you were able to dodge the attack successfully; enemies sometimes hit you with ranged attack behind cover, enemies that can change the direction of the attack mid-dash, enemies that can hit behind themself with 360 degree charge attack, useless auto aim – it changes target for some reason, stagger inconsistency – hitting enemy and getting bitten or getting hit, enemies not damaged by ulti abyss (this happened a lot with vampires); cannot dash behind enemy, so, you hit something while dashing for some reason (dash is a teleport kind of ability); blood meter that resets at death which makes everything harder after dying (first try is the easiest for that reason), ♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera angles, enemies are respawned again and again which is tiresome (they do not give any decent experience or loot also) and killing annoying mobs again and again, like the first time wasn’t a chore to kill 5 over levelled people; in addition to that, there is no fast travel which is a great choice to force the player to fight the same mobs over and over again. Another problem is leveling, especially for no kill playthroughs; you are always under leveled, even if you do all of the side quests. I was behind 10 levels. Plus acting good restricts you by giving less options for weapons. If you kill people, you can take their weapons from their chest which there is no other option to be able to use those weapons. At least there is no real variety for weapons. So, you do not miss anything special. There are only a couple different weapons and the others are the same as stats which makes choosing weapons boring. Another bad point is hint system. There is no use for hint system for good playthroughs, since you are not going to suck them, learning about them gives nothing. Unfortunately, game has no manual save option for some idiotic reason, only one save which you cannot change the option you have picked, even if you clicked it by mistake. Weirdly soundtrack is great and usage of music through the game is absolutely fantastic. With the addition of great music, atmosphere of the game is great with good setting for dark narrative. Sadly, the writing does not make for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay, because it is pretty mediocre. Race, gender issues, gay relationships are told directly (we are talking about 100 years ago for ♥♥♥♥♥ sake), not shown and too obvious, because we are idiots who need to be educated. Other than that, there are lots of contradictions like saying US women can vote which they weren’t able at 1918 or a woman screaming for women’s right at the night where a place that can only 2 people hear, burying someone at middle of midnight for some reason, vampire hunters and vampires standing next to each other and prioritize the player over each other, a regular fence which can stop you easily while the places that you can teleport is really fixed and meaningless, Mary’s feelings and main character not giving a damn about his sister at the beginning do not make any sense, character’s relation with Lady and the strength of his, since it was only a couple of days after being a vampire are another part of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ writing. Mary turning into a vampire (game tells you the victim has to drink blood but she does not even drink it) does not make any sense also. It is just there to be a meaningless twist. For some reason the streets are full of vampires, skals and vampire hunters but regular people have no idea about the situation. Narrative style is pretty much same, sadly. Only a couple choices are important and it is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Most of the choices do not matter, only important ones are at the end of the chapter or by killing regular NPCs, some of the options require checking a guide since the game does not explain it and consciously manipulating you to pick a bad option, Emily’s quest had a white option and blue option which is a decision but you won’t have any idea; so, if you try to check all of the options you got trapped, also it is directly saved, so no turning back.

76561198037246903,10,N/A,Recommended,"Even though I loved the first two games, this game wasn’t really enjoyable for me. Sadly, it feels like a half-finished work. A lot of characters’ stories remain unfinished, while the ending is rushed and not satisfactory at all (cutscene is really short). Developers seem to forget the substories, like the ending of the second game (Bolverk, horsemen, king, etc.). Also, there is a huge questionable game design choice. The game shortens as much as you played the game well, you see less content if you do not make mistakes or less mistakes. Still, the game is pretty short but it is actually a good thing. Because I was relieved that I was able to finish the game. The main reason for that is the constant crashes. Unfortunately, the game is not stable enough and there is no save option other than the autosave. Therefore, you will lose a lot of progress, especially with the wave system. Long battles were not enjoyable before and now with the wave system, it is worse. Crashes make the risky wave system riskier, since it is a huge gamble and the waves do not give a huge reward, while you are forced to finish the combat in quicker manner which was not enjoyable for me. Gameplay does not add very much other than a few new enemies with witch class and dredge playable characters. Levelling brings the title system which are passive abilities. Similar levelling system was present at the second game and it did not feel very well as a progress accomplishment feeling. Training system and camp management are gone and dialogues are much less with boring choices. Also, the achievement renown award system (you get 5 renown when you unlock an achievement for one time only) continues and it is more annoying with crashes. I have lost 15-20 renown, just because of crashes.

It is a bit similar to the first game and plain boring without any inspiration. You can see similar stories all around and this one has a lot of hollow characters. Unfortunately, endings were pretty anticlimactic and not thought thoroughly in any way. Obviously if you are playing a high chaos, game offers you much more, for the low chaos with no kill and no spot runs, it is pretty boring. Also, you see the problems with the gameplay there. I had problem with someone is dying for some reason at the end of the level with no save. Same thing happened with the spotted part, even though there was no reason for me to be spotted (Tutorial texts were open to be sure and it did not even trigger), I was spotted and that means I had to start the level from the zero. At least, they added the Stats which you can track your stats but you have to check all the time, since it can add a kill or being spotted stat. Other than that, some enemies die because of the sleep dart for no reason, bottles explode if someone falls near it or enemies get suspicious, if they hear footsteps from an inhabited area.

Sometimes cutscenes or the things that characters say do not match with the things that happened. However, it is still a dull experience.

76561198037246903,11,N/A,Recommended,"Honestly, I am giving this game a thumbs up, just because of the art direction. Some scenes were terrific (the maze one especially), art style and atmosphere were perfect. As you can see, graphics were also good. However, there are a lot of things that I did not like. First of all, the story, it wasn’t great, it did not answer any of the questions and there were overwhelming about of collectibles which did not add much to the story. The characters weren’t really that strong, also, only Ahti was an interesting character. Still, the story isn’t that bad; if you like the SCP stories, it could be interesting for you but these kinds of stories give me a sour taste for the most part. The real problem was the gameplay. It was a bit unbalanced, you can only select two weapons at the same time, most of the weapon upgrades are useless and there are a lot that you can find, enemy variety wasn’t great, soul system and constant respawns were annoying while repeatable quests were unnecessary, at the end I had a lot of souls which I cannot even use, there were no chance for me to buy the materials (mold ones were near impossible, after the related quest). By the way, I am the director, why do I need to find a keycard to access some areas? Just get the highest one from an employee. Foundations DLC was pretty much same with the main game. It adds a couple hours of playtime, a new area, it felt like a teaser for second game. It was a huge negative for me to not being able to use the new skills at other places, ally rangers’ AI and Jesse not even commenting about her fight with Former before. Other than that, new weapon upgrades were worse than the original ones and enemies felt like bullet sponges. The second expansion is similar to the first one for its features, except there is a boss which is a bit annoying at the end. Of course, except three certain upgrades, weapon upgrades are much worse and enemies have much more health. At least it adds one new enemy type and a new weapon mode.",46.4 hrs on record,N/A

Even though, story wasn’t bad, it wasn’t great either. I have played a couple walking simulators but this one was the most tedious one, because it had really ported badly for PC. There were a lot of frame drops and problem with the movement. Plus, the movement was already too slow, it made exploring the world a chore.

76561198037246903,11,N/A,Recommended,"It is a nice game which you can play with your friends or by yourself. There are lots of positives for this game: Graphics are pretty good; voice acting, music and sound design is great, world is detailed and pretty big, there are lots to discover with variety of quests which brings a long playtime, lot of skill options to choose from. However, there are some negatives also: The first one would be the Launcher. The one of the most unnecessary things to have. Other than that, there is a problem with the quests. The quest log doesn’t show anything useful, especially with some side quests. Armour set DLC quests are the worst, since it doesn’t give you the place that you can find the next piece and if you have passed the chapter without finding it, that quest line pretty much ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up. As another point, there is a huge problem with the balance and usable builds. You can build your character however you like but that does not mean that making a geomancer archer viable, since you have to rely on Finesse and Wits. That makes the build options pretty much useless. Most of the time you are granted some attribute and skill points at the level up which is far from being exiting, since you have to go for a certain part. Also, some of the builds are pretty weak, like an archer. These are really important at the hard difficulty, since the most you can do will be fighting an enemy at the same level which is another problem, because the difficulty curve is not balanced at all, especially at the last chapter, one of my characters were one-shotted at beginning of each fight, game forcing some fights with the fixed positions made it even worse. One other thing was the items. Item randomization is a really bad choice for this game. Especially there are intelligence required items which gives skills like huntsman. We had more than 300k at the end game and wasn’t able to purchase anything for a long time also. So, money will be useless after a while. Another problem was main characters’ stories which are a bit short and scattered with a couple quests only. It felt like a feature added as a DLC. Lastly, achievements, decisions, companions and persuasion are not a great mechanics at multiplayer. They are not implemented greatly to the game and it doesn’t feel smooth at all.

Obviously, graphics were great for 15 years ago but now it is not great, though it was playable for me. Music is fantastic, especially the one at the beginning of the game. Writing style was enjoyable with the comedic touch and being weird as a fun way. Even though story was decent, there were lots of holes in it. Most of the time, I did not get why I am going to a certain place for looking Dante or doing something. Still these weren’t big problems for me. The most important part was the gameplay for me: Sadly, this was the problem for me. Although, there were a lot of combos with different characters, only Nero/Dante part was canonical which means you have to play the same game without story to experience the other characters which makes it a bit repetitive and senseless. Plus, the achievements require you to complete the same game over and over for at least 7 times. Even without the other characters, game uses the same places and the same bosses for multiple times (there was a problem with the budget I think). Last two chapters were horrendous for me, with the dice parts for no reason and annoying boss. I had hard time dodging the enemy skills, since it was hard for me to see with the old graphics. However, most important problem was the tutorial and the keys. The game gives the tutorial with the PlayStation keys and when you check the skills, you can only see those keys which makes learning a trial and error with weird key mapping or research from the web. Lastly, I can say that controls were a bit unresponsive and the camera angles were really bad also.

76561198037246903,12,N/A,Recommended,"Warning for spoilers. Even though I loved the first two Life is Strange games this game was definitely not for me. I had a hard time finishing it and I procrastinated it for a long time (like a year). At first, I thought that I did not have the mindset but at the third chapter I realized that game was the problem. Writing is really bad and it is not remotely interesting. Characters are really shallow and most of them are really one sided. The little brother was really annoying and repulsive, and it felt like a chore to talk to him for the most of the time. Also, the side characters were much worse than him. Game constantly forces the certain people are racist narrative. Literally every single chapter has a racist right-wing antagonist with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stereotype (religious people, even with a church to burn down, multiple hillbillies, cops and border vigilantes at the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wall) except the third chapter which was the most playable chapter for me. The left-wing characters are the same. They are extreme and annoying for the most part. At last chapter there is a guy who says he left his kids and wife, after coming out as a gay man and blames the family for not being okay for being him gay (marrying a woman without even being attracted to hear, making multiple children, all being a lie). Weirdly, it is expected people to be okay with marrying someone without even being remotely attach to a person a start a family, then saying it is not good for me, leaving the family, starting a relationship with a man in a hippie lifestyle while it is being commented as being “brave”. Plus, there are some weird commentaries about “being a real patriot”, because there is a pride flag with American flag. Most of the “good guys” from the game sound like that unfortunately. Another example being a journalist which had rich parents and he lives on the road not being part of the family fortune, since they are cynical people, while researching nudist people. Sadly, they did not even try to create a decent character or story which brings us to the main point of the story: If there is a criminal activity and you are not white, you will go to the jail. Even the one of the endings supports this idea which makes absolutely no sense, there is no evidence for them to be charged. All of the endings are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ than next one and again do not make any sense. Other than that, the choices are really bad in this game. They do not matter and no impact on the story, since every chapter has some different forgettable character and still the game gives you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ options; like stealing, normalizing a mother who leaves two children (one of them is a baby), because she was “bored” (you are forced to make up with her) or running away from the cops for no reason. I felt the hate while I was playing the game but it was not about the racism against a minority group, it was hate against another group of people. Lastly, I do not know how the developers have the audacity to lecture other people openly with this kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ writing, especially being French and making a game about racism in USA while selling it worldwide. Talk about being hypocritical and looking down to people. Most of the people do not play games to be lectured, they play them to have a nice time and this game’s aim is certainly not it.",20.4 hrs on record,N/A
76561198037246903,12,N/A,Recommended,"This DLC actually does not add anything noteworthy. Enemies are the same as the original other than adding pod to their names, changing the visual a bit and tweaking some numbers like health and damage which is the same with leveling enemies. Only new enemy is a pod which can spawn enemies. Game gives you some new side missions for old areas which is again same enemies with a name. As for the new character, he has two new skills which are not very useful and he is very behind of your characters. Therefore, you do not want to use him. Only new leveling you can do is some upgrades. Most of them do not feel very different other than the vine ability which is great. Sadly, you will have so much ability points which you cannot use at DLC. Also, there is no new shop item, even though the game says there are some new items, only the items like medikits and grenades are restocked. Because of that you are not going to use scrap too. Other than that, there are some new items. Even though, hats are useful, they are not a groundbreaking upgrades (this could be the only positive by the way). New weapons are much worse than that. Only Rambino with Silencer is a better weapon, other items were weaker than my main team’s weapons; so I did not even use them. The upgrades are pretty weak again which only improves the consumables (if you play for ambushes, they do not even matter). Lastly the story, it isn’t really interesting, related or detailed; just there to be there.

Since I enjoy puzzles and reading in games, it was enjoyable for me. The story of the game is interesting but some of the puzzles do not make sense, probably because of the translation. It was not a really good translation unfortunately (it was understandable though).

However, I have to point out that there is a huge balancing issue, since some of the cards are useless and some of the side quests cannot be completed with different card selections. Also, randomization of everything is a really big problem like card shuffle, card choices or ability choices. If you do not have the right cards or you did not draw them, you can get hit at the first movement, no matter what you do. Unfortunately, there is no balance for bad luck which is a bit frustrating. Other than that, some cards weren’t explained clearly and trying to figure it out was a bit annoying. There are a lot of cards, decks and enemies though which is a plus. Music was fun at first but it gets annoying after a while, since there aren’t many songs. As you can imagine, there is no story and I do not think there is any need for that.

The characters were so good with great layers and their development with the unfolding of their stories were a magnificent experience for me. Story and narrative style of the game were perfect with Mimir, conversations between father and son, interactions, child’s growing up or a father’s growing up, and naturality of the all. Also, Baldur’s story is one of my favorites in mythology which was a great part of the game. As you can see that the graphics are pretty good. As for gameplay mechanics, it starts a bit slow with limited move set but with a little progress you and boy open new skills and gameplay gets richer. Stagger effect was a bit annoying for me, since the enemies do not get staggered easily, while I was being staggered at every hit but you get used to after a bit progress. Atreus’ playstyle as a support character is greatly implemented with a parallel narrative to the story and gameplay without a problem which I thought it was really original. However, I would not recommend the hardest difficulty; because a god feels a bit too weak against regular enemies in that mode and you cannot change the difficulty which makes the side lands pretty obnoxious.

That’s a huge negative point for me. Story and atmosphere are a bit more linear in this game. I can even say that this game bored me a bit with the lack of story for some parts. Although there are some interesting characters, there isn’t much development for them or their stories. Other than that, story feels a bit short and not satisfying. It is still great for its price but I expected much more than that. Card system doesn’t give much of a choice or it doesn’t feel like it has a great effect. Guns are pretty much the same; because there isn’t much variety, especially when you compared with the first game. Also, Clailish’s bow and arrow are almost useless which was another disappointment for me. Plus, one of the achievements is broken at the moment.

I'm pretty sure you will want to change some of the consequences, because some of them does not make sense and they are triggering. Story of the game is obviously great. The lore is based on Nordic mythology and developed from there. Characters feels like they are alive, you can observe some of them developing or dying tragically. The story is definitely not optimistic. Trusting and helping everyone mostly causes huge problems.

Dialogues try to be something but mostly fails with half delivered jokes, characters acting weird, story’s low quality. Plus, acting is bad for the most part.

76561198037246903,27,N/A,Recommended,"This game is the one of the best games I have ever played. It may seem like a childish game with its setting and the main events but there is a certain grimness behind that naïve world (you can check the negative reviews for that part). Even though frame of the story isn’t spectacular, enjoyable dialogues and story elements make it more than fine. Unexpectedly, game has some great songs and these songs have a great harmony with the levels. The most well-made part of the game is level design. None of the levels have the same mechanics with each other, other than a tiny platforming mechanic. Every level offers you a different experience and each of them is different for different characters. Because of that, you can finish the game twice without getting bored. Plus, game length isn’t short for sure (it took us 16 to finish). Sadly, game requires Origin account for at least one person but you can play with Remote Play too. Our problem with Friend’s Pass, which is the system to play with only one purchased game, was the only problem with the game which we were able to fix it. Obviously, I definitely recommend this game to everyone (maybe not for the people who want to play with their children).",16.4 hrs on record																					(15.9 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198037246903,27,N/A,Recommended,"This game has its upsides and downsides but some of these downsides are much more important to me and because of that, I gave it a thumbs down. Graphics, Audio and Story First of all, game has great face modelling. I mean graphics are good but face modelling is another level. Other than that, there are animals wandering around and a lot of different interactions with the world. Second of all, there is only Japanese voice acting (not every dialogue has voice acting though) but it is pretty good. You will listen the voice acting a lot, because there are a lot of cutscenes which you can pause (I still feel like it’s a great thing). However, these cutscenes have some huge problems. Firstly, there is a lot of money talk in game but you don’t care; your money requirements for skills are already much more than amount that people go to war. Secondly, the game has too many coincidences and it feels like a cheap soap opera; if you add many cutscenes and dialogues to this problem, it will multiply the existing situation. Thirdly, there are only a couple of good side quests, others are just childish: Shallow topics like friendship, idiotically positive vibes. Missions and other activities are worthless, they only damage the slow pacing main story’s progress. Yakuza is afraid to kill someone weirdly, whatever antagonists do, our great protagonists let them live and you know that our great protagonists can defeat Yakuza countless time but they will run from them at the next encounter. Lastly, there is almost no gun; everyone uses fists but if one person has a gun, it changes everything. Still, no one uses a gun and if someone has a gun, that scene goes illogically like police leaving a gun in front of a huge crime boss. Game Design General game design choices aren’t so great either. Before I begin, I need to say that I hate the loud Sega screen. I don’t know whose idea was that but I definitely hate him/her. Weirdly, there isn’t a decent autosave option to leave the game confidently. Sadly, there is an audio bug when you lower the audio from the game which turns off the sound completely (it took me two chapters to figure it out). Other than that, there are some aggressive item problems: You can see a lot of people are talking about overly aggressive enemies and really annoying combat. They all had the same equipment and they didn’t know it was the cause. There are some items which makes combat a lot harder and I don’t think game explains it well. Since, this game is Japanese origin, you have to check Japanese signs when you have to look for the buildings for the real estate part and that will be annoying. Unfortunately, there is no good way finding them. Plus, Kiryu estate has a weird difficulty curve while Majima business is useless moneywise. By the way, there are no options to collect money automatically, you have to go and get it or play a minigame with Majima. If you are looking for driving or a huge map experience like other sandbox games, this game doesn’t have them; although it wasn’t a problem for me, it can be a problem for some people. Still, the game has a lot to do and a huge a gameplay time. Weirdly, you can change your clothes after finishing the game and there is no option to go legendary difficulty with a used save file. I don’t think port is good either. There are some weird menu designs, exit, skill selection, etc. and not enough information: Game won’t tell you that you can sprint and you can’t find it under settings; because you sprint with “e” and there isn’t any sign at the key bindings section; they call this action “dash” by the way, not “sprint” I guess their lingo is different from PC lingo. For the controller part, you can understand it is not a good port from the “Real yakuza uses a gamepad” at the start screen and the car chase episode or combat proves it. Combat The game’s one of the most important part is the combat which I had some mixed feelings. With every part of the game, this part has the quantity advantage: There are a lot of skills, weapons and stances. However, they get repetitive after a while. Sadly, battle is clunky; you can’t dodge mid-combo (your enemy can do that) and there are many unnecessary movements to slow you down at the battle. Since this game is designed for a controller, there is a lock system but it isn’t the greatest. And if you don’t use it, you will punch the air a lot even if you are directly looking at your enemy. Enemies can turn 180 degrees when you dodge them (even 360 degrees has happened). Sometimes they can have a greater range than you with a knife. Stagger effect isn’t consistent when you hit enemies and enemy stagger is really annoying. You can get hit with 10 consecutive staggering hits easily at some fights. Some of the bosses can dodge while you are hitting them and sometimes there will be no effect to enemy guard when you hit him/her with a huge object. Other than these, there is heat actions to make combat more diverse. There are a lot of different heat actions to see but after a while watching them becomes a chore. Plus, windows of opportunity for it are so brief (sometimes less than a second with a very specific angle). Because of the heating attack problems immediate attacks can happen and make you more annoyed. Huge part of the game was minigames for me and there are a lot of them. Sadly, they aren’t really good. I was only able to enjoy fishing and karaoke amongst them. Telephone club was a bit repetitive, race had not enough instructions and I still weirded out by porn video section. Batting has the tiniest window, disco has epilepsy lights – thanks to them, no chance to see – and off beat music, pool is the weirdest pool game I’ve ever seen, darts game is mostly luck, catfight (the most idiotic minigame ever) AI cheats with button mashing part (why do they even put it in the game?) and an annoying achievement, learning far eastern games is too hard (not enough explanation) while shogi and Mahjong has language barriers, arcade games look bad and have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls. Because of these reasons, most of the games feel like just there to be there; unfortunately, I hate the quantity over quality approach. Plus, you can’t retry the minigames after you fail, you need to watch the animation again and again. Same thing goes with the equipment search. Conclusion To sum up, if you are looking a meme game with a simple story and do not want to scrutinize, I think you can enjoy this game; otherwise, you will be annoyed for the most part. For me, it only showed that quality of GTA and Saint’s Row series.",125.8 hrs on record,N/A

Since, Paradox Interactive is the publisher, there are a lot of DLC to milk their customers (some of these DLCs are required for achievements). The idea of space city building is great but sadly, there isn’t much to do in game. There aren’t many buildings, activities, aim or a motive to play. Developers designed the game with a drone workforce and since this workforce does most of the work, colonists, which you can’t set a specific number to stop them having a child (instead you have to choose yourself colony by colony), feel like a burden. For the positive parts, as you can see graphics are pretty good looking, the game has a great OST, even though it is pretty basic there is a try for partial story implementation, map choices with modifiers and challenges, skins (!) and I can’t say that I have encountered any bugs. The game was fun for me for a couple hours, after that it became a bit dull.

They can compete with you to achieve some points but again they are so slow, you will forget they are there. It leaves them as some bad events probability, because they tend to sabotage even if your relationship is good.

First of all, this DLC should have been included in main game; in this case it isn’t, like every other Paradox Interactive game. If we pass the charging extra for regular content part, there is no reason to terraform Mars in the game. Terraforming only provides some tiny advantages like vaporizer production increase, no meteor showers, soil quality increase. These could have been useful if climate change, water and atmosphere presence, terraforming were easy but they take so much time, especially the terraforming part (You can only do the planetary mission to increase terraforming after 40% and you need to wait for sols to be able to do them.). So, this means you will have all of the researches with a huge colony when you finished it and you won’t need these advantages. Plus, none of the other colonies try to help you with this task.

76561198037246903,28,N/A,Recommended,"This game is one of the games which make you think “Am I too old for this ♥♥♥♥?”. Even though it has its positive aspects, there are a lot of bad design choices. First of all, color palette is just limited. Most of the enemies are the same color and their attack action colors are similar to them. What is that mean? It means when you fight against a group of enemies you will have a problem to see the visual clues, you will rely on the audio for the most of the time. Other than that, there is story. It is generic. It doesn’t really say anything and when it says something, it is mostly about a discrete tiny piece. Because of the huge amount of cutscenes and their length it becomes more and more annoying. Focus on Bayonetta’s sexiness and cheesiness feels decent at first, then it becomes another repetitive element. As for the gameplay, balance is pretty off. Prologue of the hardest mode (regular difficulty was a bit hard to adjust too) was the hardest part of the game for me (Except the half-forced ♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera; it is the toughest enemy, especially against flying enemies.). Same problem applies to the challenges. Those challenges are not for a new player, they are for a second playthrough. There are a lot of challenges at first chapters which are harder than the late part of the game. Balance is not the only problem about learning the game. There is almost no explanation and no option to practice. They thought putting the practice part at the loading screen which makes impossible to try something at a modern PC, is a good idea and there is no other option to do it. Other than that, the game has one of the worst menus I’ve ever seen (like equipping weapons and leaving the menu). That’s probably because of the port though. And there is the save system. Probably you will have a hard time understanding it like a lot of people and lose your save when you leave the game for the first time. Even the second playthrough design has some problems: Tiger mode cannot be disabled and it can cause you to die if you use it before acquiring it at your second playthrough. Unfortunately, controls and combat aren’t great too. I played the game with a keyboard and mouse and felt the unresponsive controls. And you can add bad counter/witch time system (there are a lot of problems) to unresponsive controls. Even though there are a lot of weapons, there are only 3 quick use and two weapon slots. So, you need to change your combination from the menu if you want to change to another weapon other than the one you set. Furthermore, torture and climax attacks are really torture. Since using an animation mid-combat doesn’t make any sense, you will avoid using those attacks as far as you can. Sadly, these attacks are forced during boss fights but fortunately there aren’t many boss fights. Moreover, enemies can instantly attack you after spawn, knock down or cutscene (including torture attack animations). Plus, there are some annoying quick-time events which can kill you instantly and the expected reaction time of theirs is pretty narrow. These quick-time events can occur during cutscenes and can be bugged (I am talking about epilogue one). Lastly, halo (currency) system is too slow to progress.

76561198037246903,28,N/A,Recommended,"This game has a similar style to UFO/XCOM series but with a spy setting. Sadly, it isn’t a great combination, at least for this game. This game has a lot of different features and it looks like there are a lot to do but most of these features are useless. And because of that, game feels really repetitive; with the long playtime to finish and supposedly different stories, repetitiveness becomes much worse. Story is the one of the blandest I have ever seen; it’s just like a mixture of spy thriller common themes, nothing more. I mean nothing specific. Being a member of CIA, KGB or Mossad (extended mode is the same too) offers only one hour of different “content” but developers advertise it like a different experience. There are some cases for you to read for narrative, I guess. However, developers decided to split a couple of ambiguous cases and censor some of the words to reuse it. Then, the player needs to solve this case for no narrative reward. After that rinse and repeat. Unfortunately, there isn’t many cases and to compensate for this, developers decided to use same cases with different names and again there aren’t many cases. Plus, leaving the cases are more beneficial for you. And please, stop the “this is a real story” cliche to sell more. Weirdly, there are some animations, that you will turn off from the options at your first hours and some cosmetic variety. They could have added a decent camera for enemy turn to show important things or a good explanation for the technology that you can unlock but they didn’t care for these parts. As for the gameplay, only main missions are established, all of the other missions and most of their content are random which means you can see an enemy agent with a great health bar like I did (it is especially a problem at hard) at the beginning of the game. Another random thing is leveling; you can only choose from 4 different skills while leveling up and a lot of these skills are useless. Even though game is turn based, if an enemy sees you in your turn, all of the enemies will turn hostile and all of them will know where your agents are. Even if they don’t see you, they will magically learn your position. You can choose to go guns blazing or to infiltrate but there is no real reason to go aggressive as enemy will get never-ending reinforcements. Another problem for me was the design choices: You can’t hide the bodies at hard but you can magically disappear them at easy, bad pathing, no option to choose a route to move, killing civilians causing penalties but exploding a building they are stationed not having any impact; contrary to teaching skills, weapons, biological improvement, there is no option to teach languages, and weirdest of them all: Enemies don’t react when you jump out of closed windows (no damage of course); in fact, those routes are regular ones. Because of the reasons I mentioned, gameplay feels like a chore.

First of all, this game isn’t really a game; there is no actual gameplay. However, it is pretty unique at telling its stories. Sadly, only thing I like about the game is narrative (art style and graphics are okay): Each story has their own narrative and mechanics to experience it. But again, there isn’t much to experience; you can’t look at the items in the house like “Gone Home”, weirdly books are copy-pasted (weird because there are a lot of them), all of the stories are short (some of them shorter than a minute, longest is 5 minutes I think). These points only leave the story which is the most important part of a game like this. All of the stories are written in a symbolical manner with a common theme but they don’t have a foot in the general story in a realistic sense. Although, most of the stories are predictable, game forcing you to finish the story of that character makes you feel responsible and that was the only enjoyable moment for me which made not having a reality connection worse. Sadly, this game feels rushed with its writing and abrupt ending and because of that I cannot recommend it. P.S.

However, these additions to New Lands aren’t enough for someone who has played the other Kingdom games and co-op isn’t challenging or a different kind of approach. For these reasons, developers added two free DLCs.

Even though this feature makes game harder and interesting, it makes the game a bit grindy. Because there isn’t any place to expand, you earn resources very slowly. Same thing is valid with the researches, they are so slow. Also, your people need many things for a quality life like hospitals and universities. I mean thousand people need at least 5 university for their life quality. Because of that you won’t be able to accomplish to fulfill everything. There are some buildings you can build at sidewalls but the system is a bit problematic (it requires a certain height which you don’t know). Definitely, you need to be careful with the random generation. Other than that, there are some ground buildings but again, engineers who build the ground buildings require a lot of squires and they are annoyingly slow. Even with the grind, I was pretty rich around mid-game but there wasn’t a really good option to share it with other places. So, it felt a bit repetitive at the end. As you can understand game needs some updates. Still, it was pretty enjoyable to play. Although there is no story, there are some quests to complete. However, like the interface, this feature shows lack of experience. I didn’t even know there were other quests other than occurring hazards with some unlockables. Those quests add some unique things to gameplay. By the way, “tab” key is for the exploration mode. I didn’t know the shortcut first and you can’t go back to regular point of view with the mouse. Therefore, I was stuck and had to start again. Apart from that, music will get old quickly, exploring the city with a car or in a free form is pretty great, art style is interesting but optimization isn’t so good.

76561198037246903,30,N/A,Recommended,"Before I start, I don’t like the rogue-lite genre, I just bought this game because of its developers; maybe that caused having mixed feelings about this game. Even though, I loved the art style, it feels like a bit PG (Tartarus-Hell). Other than that, they are a bit shiny for a game like this: If I get some boons from Zeus and Dionysus to make a combo, I can’t see my enemies’ movements to dodge them. That wasn’t a huge problem though. Let’s continue with the most important aspect of rogue-lite: Gameplay. A rogue-lite game must be challenging and not-repetitive while it makes you a better (both as a player and character progression). However, Hades doesn’t give the feeling of either of those. Enemy and area variety isn’t great, boons you get don’t have many aspects to follow while duo boons and legendary boons are limited (you reach them mostly at the end of the run). There are some different weapons and their different aspects but again they are not so different from each other. For example, best way to fight with melee weapons is spam locking the enemy. Unlockable skills are too passive most of the time (stat increases, more health, more resurrection, more boon rerolls or more dashes). Because of these passive progression skills, you don’t feel stronger or the satisfaction of progression; it just feels like a grind. In addition to that, rewards like darkness, gems, ambrosia are quite low, while requirements of rewards are so high. Maybe, it is just because I don’t enjoy rogue-lites, I don’t know. One of the most important things in a game is story/writing for me and when I looked back the other games of Supergiant, this game doesn’t feel that strong. First of all, story comes from a modern rewrite of Greek mythology. There are lots of references but they are not so deep, mostly mentions (Zeus being a serial rapist, Hades’ story, etc.). When I look at the story and the usage of the atmosphere, they felt disconnected. Most of the dialogues are random and there are lots of different dialogues. So, when you trigger a condition, like two character talking to each other, a lot of time can pass until you can talk one of the characters about the conversation. For instance, when I completed the Poseidon’s quest, I was able to talk to him about it 15 runs later. Other than that, there is the story progression aspect which is a hard thing at a rogue-lite. Even though, Hades provides the motive in a logical way and integrate it in genre’s features. It feels slow and grindy. When you combine it with the low amount of rewards, game feels like a chore. Also, credit and epilogue scenes were a bit anticlimactic. As a positive note, game offers you a god-mode (again a bit grindy god-mode) option to see the story (the slow progression and countless runs requirement persists of course). Lastly, music and sound design. Although, sound design and voice-acting are pretty great, music isn’t there. Most of the songs are ambiance/combat music and they have some style. Unfortunately, these songs aren’t remarkable. Other songs are good but not as Transistor or Bastion OST. You can see Darren Korb’s super high voice range or hear Ashley Barrett’s lovely voice but they don’t feel like a soundtrack, they feel like independent songs. As mentioned before, integration is a huge problem in this game. And one of the greatest features of the Supergiant’ games was harmony between music and atmosphere or story. In conclusion, I have a lot of problem with Hades. Probably some of them because of the high expectations I have, some of them because of the genre. Still, I do think this game isn’t a bad game, especially with its low price, sales policy and not being a broken game (I still haven’t seen a bug at a Supergiant game). Sadly, Hades was a mediocre experience for me.",79.3 hrs on record,N/A

There isn’t much to do as gamewise, mostly you wonder around and do some tasks but these tasks are pretty simple tasks. Only difficult thing with these tasks/puzzles is the lack of instruction (same with objective marker). So, you need to listen carefully and focus while playing to not get lost (one of the first tasks don’t even say which key you should press). Bright side of the lack of instructions is the realism. Since this game feels like a movie, they avoided weird adventure like puzzles to be persistent with the realism aspect. As you can understand, strongest aspect of Observation is its cinematography. Graphics, point of view, stage-setting and scenery, sound and voice acting are pretty good. However, that’s all; it is a bit long for a movie unfortunately and because of that mystery starts to fade in a couple hours, then story feels like a mediocre one.

76561198037246903,30,N/A,Recommended,"This game starts as an interesting sim game but after a while becomes a chore. First of all, this game has a huge memory leak issue which means your computer will have a performance issue even after you turn off the game (you need a restart to fix it) and this issue persists for a long time which means fix will be an unrealistic expectation. Other than that, this game has a huge lore and abnormality variety with stories (see below). Gameplaywise, there isn’t much to do sadly. This game could have been a mobile game easily. There isn’t much to do as macro management while micro management is too limiting. Unfortunately, all of these abnormalities are random while they have different difficulty levels with a certain limitation and that limitation isn’t enough but apparently developers didn’t care; because you can’t finish the game with true ending in one playthrough (if you don’t save scum of course). You can see my playtime above for one playthrough; I had to start-over because of the two alephs I picked around twentieth day (same day). It was an instant game over. After that, I started to check the abnormalities before picking them but even with that, end game was too annoying and repetitive, especially with the leak. Lastly, AI is pretty dumb and unresponsive some times which can mean losing all of your agents. And this will be pretty annoying, because there is no save feature in days, even though they will get longer, more you progress. At my last run, I was so annoyed of daily abnormality satisfaction pile, after dying to midnight waves. So, I uninstalled the game at day 42 and watch the end game. Definitely, it isn’t worth it, like the story of the game. Story is just a visual novel with fanfiction writing from a website, it seems. However, plot is like this: You are a manager and you produce energy from these dangerous abnormalities. While there is an AI which helps you (not a tiniest bit) to manage the facility, there are some floor managers. You talk to these managers and learn their stories and question some of the things but they are not relevant to gameplay at all. And at the same time, their stories are so abstract and short. At the start of the game, you think that you don’t know the background of your character, sadly your character doesn’t remember anything too. So, what does he do? Nothing, just nothing. You learn it from the AI, just terrific. What about huge lore though, is it good? That is just mediocre with lots of holes, like it just happens logic.

76561198037246903,33,N/A,Recommended,"This game is in between an old-school adventure game and a visual novel. Unfortunately, this doesn’t affect the gameplay well; because it isn’t exactly an adventure game, there isn’t any real puzzle and this is not exactly a visual novel which means you don’t expect it to be this dull. Still, it has some advantages and good gameplay aspects like travel scenes, non-linear narrative (both with characters and timeline) and variety of protagonists. Other than these, soundtracks are exceptional. Plus, the narrator voice-overs are pretty good too, but weirdly there are some delay on lip-synch at some scenes. Even though, game was intriguing at first, it became dull after a while, especially at last book. Problem with the story is consisting many plots and using many revelations for the story, especially in book three to resolve everything quickly. Moreover, it became more preachy as the story progress. Particularly at the last part, there were many unrealistic and rushed things in game. I can summarise these as being a black merchant at 12. century while no one mentions you are black (Meg), Banu Musa (it really feels like a joke and their quick understanding of new things is really childish), forgetting you made a consequence [Even though, Richard says you won’t be a countess, you are the countess in next scene (There is even a missable achievement for becoming countess).], search for Jack (that part gave me a tremendously sour taste and the perfect English everyone has (Even in most of the foreign lands).

Great modelling and graphics turned to be a mediocre modelling while Watson, and Sherlock’s new style, looks unnecessarily modern. On the bright side, Watson isn’t a useless yes man anymore. As for the gameplay, this game doesn’t feel like a puzzle/adventure game anymore, it feels like a quick time events game. Sadly, there aren’t many puzzles in the game and adding a lot of quick time events feels weird. Normally, it could have been a good thing but when you buy a Sherlock Holmes game, you expect something particular. Puzzle quality and originality isn’t good either. There are lots of trial and error in puzzles (Mayan ones) and Mayan calendar is plain annoying (There are many similar words which is the point of using the same glyphs). Honestly, I hated the second case. That case doesn’t make any sense and thinks itself as an Indiana Jones movie which was the thing I hated most at some parts of Crimes and Punishments. Sadly, developers thought adding more gameplay like that is a good idea. Other than that, you can’t change your observation which game doesn’t warn you about it, and making a mistake feels pretty annoying if you are completionist like me. However, there are some good additions (second half of the game) as the case variety. Those cases give you a fresh and fun experience with their unique playstyle. Lastly, they added streets to every place you can visit. You can travel and discover those places but adding this feature wasn’t really a good idea. They mostly used a copy paste approach for it and you won’t find anything new if you try to discover them. They only made me lose my interest. Storywise, there are lots of plot holes and bad choices: First of all, with the flashback first case is so obvious, you can figure it out the whole story pretty quickly which makes it boring. Other than that, there is a place that you need to disguise yourself as a doctor and that means you need to wear an apron while Watson standing with you in regular clothes. Apparently only Sherlock needs to wear an apron to be a doctor, since other doctors don’t care about it. Moreover, game doesn’t explain to you what happened in second case (with the statues). Additionally, there is a mini case from one of the Sherlock Holmes books and it makes zero sense. Client has different coloured boots which is supposed to show us she is myopic. I am myopic and astigmatic more than 25 years and only thing I can differentiate clearly without my glasses are colours. Furthermore, canonical choice of the case doesn’t make any sense either. She couldn’t understand her lover whom she talked for days and seen him from close distance was his father, not a hired guy. Of course, that is more logical(!) Sherlock’s daughter story is another ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Sherlock knows that his neighbour is a cultist, she performs weird rituals for death, she knows his secret and blackmails him about it but he doesn’t care about it.

Every character you see mocks Death or give him something to do for themselves. Since you know the story from the first game, you only learn about Death and his backstory which isn’t much. So, you will probably go into some dungeons and solve puzzles while doing platforms without caring about story. DLC campaigns only give you some short dungeons with same enemies out of the blue. There are some variety about platforming and puzzle aspect of the game but it is over-used. For that reason, that part feels like a chore after a while. Game is a bit more like an open world game and there some side quests in it. Although there isn’t much to do in this open world and side quest mostly collection quests; these quests are annoying even with a guide (there is no checklist in game for it). There is a new game+ option after finishing the game but I don’t know why someone would like to do that. First playthrough is pretty soulless and repetitive by itself already. What about combat though? It should be the most important part of the game, right? Unfortunately, no. There aren’t many combos or moves, combat is repetitive and there isn’t much of a variety of enemies, except the paint jobs of different enemies. Sadly, boss fights don’t compensate for these too and the Reaper form feels pretty weak. And most of the battles are against camera angles or bad viewpoints. Morever, locking into a big enemy doesn't help you at all. There are couple of skills to level up (not so much) and some gear to drop. Most of the gear you will find be useless and since money is mostly useless, selling them wouldn’t be useful either. By the way, there is no explanation about stats or weapons’ specials; so, good luck figuring them out by yourself. Lastly, bugs: Game is a huge bugfest. I encountered every kind of it; crash, visual, audio, unresponsive game, puzzles. Let me summarize them for you quickly: Game can crash sometimes and there is nothing you can do about it.  Other than that, graphics looks pixelated in modern systems while audio will partially disappear more you play or you change into additional campaigns. Sometimes your character won’t move if you press escape and you will be forced to restart the game. Additional campaigns have some broken puzzles; some may require you to restart, some will need a work around to solve it.

And because of the over smugness of Sherlock, I definitely prefer game version of Sherlock Holmes to TV show one. Still, game characterises Watson like an imbecile and a yes-man which I don’t enjoy. Although, Watson has the most ironic line in game: “You don’t have no right to take your own life”. Stories in game are mostly satisfying, except two of the cases. Both of these cases (sauna and garden) don’t make any sense at all. Other than that, none of the cases that you solved, are based on real evidences. Most of the time, you use circumstantial evidences to arrest someone. Maybe they could have led to a real evidence. Moreover, game offers you a chance to make the wrong choice and continue from that.

Thanks to game mechanics you can easily choose another option in a case, change your decision or replay a chapter. Interface is not so different in that aspect; it is easy to use and detailed as it should be in a detective game. Game has the deduction mode which gives you an option to analyse a suspect. It is pretty original and with the detailed face and character modelling, offers you a fun experience. I should add that, loading screens of the game are pretty modern and interesting (at first at least). The most interesting part of the game for me was its unique design. There are lots of different scenes/places and they are not repetitive or they don’t feel like a copy-paste. The same thing applies for the mini games/puzzles.

While you are playing game, you have to spend most of your time to steer around. Then, read some text and after that steer again. There can be some random events or sea monster and other ships rarely but they will get repetitive quickly. Unfortunately, mission requirements are not balanced or have enough information about them (same with the items) and that means you can get a mission which will badly affect you, even kill you if you are not prepared enough. Because of the lack of information, you feel lost most of the time. Since the game is so slow and you are doing multiple missions at the same time, you will forget some missions’ details. Because game doesn’t record most of the information, you will need to check the information you need from the internet (Journal is really messy, finished things don’t disappear or don’t go into a separate group). Worst part of the game is randomisation. Most of the interactions are randomised, while there are some fixed conditions, and most of these interactions result with randomisation of skill or luck rolls. It doesn’t help most of the rolls are built for later playthroughs. Sadly, if you don’t die and farm your heritage, game will be much slower and harder. Even though there is a very limited cargo space at your first ship, most of the ships are just useless and all of them are expensive. It almost makes up for not being able to leave your ship to your heir. Most of the mission rewards are parallel to this. The resources you spent to finish the mission is almost worth as the rewards. With the hours you spent, it feels frustrating. Because you can’t finish everything in one run (your character retires after certain missions), you will be weaker if you do a main run and then discovering. As story, game is pretty intriguing. There are a lot of mysteries and the world is attracting. However, mystery is a bit too much and because of that, finishing the storyline doesn’t give you much. There are lots of moral choices but there is no consequence for them. So, you are trying to make an important decision without a reward or enough information. Hence, this makes the decision meaningless. It is same with the endings, fulfilling an ambition doesn't satisfy you a bit; you can go and retire instead of fulfilling an ambition. There isn't anything other than a tiny piece of writing. If you add the slow game progress to this, you will have a hard time enjoying the story. By the way, most of the quests send you other places and when you go there you discover you need some particular items to progress. So, you go and fetch some items for the quest. What happens next? Same thing again. It's a pretty rare sight for you to know what do you need before you go to the target. Just think about, you go from London (western part) to a port at the farthest point. Then, you discover you need to go where you came from to buy something. Unfortunately, quest progress is really dull. To sum up, game is intriguing at first, boring and repetitive after playing a bit. At least, the game isn't expensive.",96.9 hrs on record,N/A

76561198037246903,34,N/A,Recommended,"Until the last chapter I thought this game was good but after the last chapter’s bad writing other problems made a snowball effect for me. First of all, graphics are improved very much and it looks like a modern game. I am really satisfied with that part. However, there are some bugs, crashes and sensitivity problem. Other than that, it is pretty obvious that game is rushed. There isn’t any act selection for collectibles, achievements or exploring and you can’t skip the mandatory summary and pre-credit at the start of every episode. That would be tolerable if you had any option to skip dialogues but no, you do not have any option to skip the dialogues you have seen a couple of times. I watched 10 episodes of a sitcom while I was waiting for the game to reach where I am supposed to be for other achievements. Plus, collectible mechanic is a bit of a spoiler (because you know where to put them). As for the writing, dialogues of the characters are really good while they feel sincere and vivid. Unfortunately, endings don’t have a real variety, most of it is a replica of the other. Game is aiming to be reflection of the first game with Lee-Clementine and Clementine-AJ relations and that is like seeing your daughter had an unwanted pregnancy which you are exposed a lot of their troubles. Unfortunately, AJ isn’t sympathetic as Clementine. I wouldn’t say that is a huge problem though. Problem is last episode’s inconsistency/bad writing. Bridge scene is idiotic as far as it can be. A girl shooting and screaming in a herd without any of the walker’s attention. Instead walkers are moving where she wants. Then, the person with a gun, AJ, doesn’t even try to shoot walkers and shoots Tenn or lets Violet/Luke die (That is the big consequence moment). Other than that, there is this bite issue. AJ chops Clementine’s leg right after cutting a walker and infecting the axe. And before the chopping, you clearly see the symptoms of the disease which proves she is already far gone. However, developers have chosen a forced and irrational ending for the series. If they really wanted a good ending, they could have given a decent hallucination with Lee acknowledging Clementine before she dies and some AJ part at the end. Sadly, no. Lastly, there is this idiotic flashback about ranch. People are shooting Clementine, because they are under attack. Then, Clementine choses to charge them. Not staying in cover and explaining anything or offering help. Instead she kills innocent people to just have an artificial depth to her actions. Because of these moments, game is able to continue to be interesting in last chapter only as AJ’s shock duration at ranch: A couple minutes. This game is only playable as a closure, nothing more.",20.6 hrs on record,N/A
76561198037246903,34,N/A,Recommended,"This game is a first-person puzzle game like Turing Test and Portal. Puzzles have some variety and they are really original. However, there is a delay between your moves and aiming isn’t implemented well enough. Unfortunately, these problems are much more problematic at the challenges (DLC originally). Plus, there is a motion blur problem. Original Q.U.B.E doesn’t have a story and it only focuses at the puzzles but with the Director’s Cut there is a story included. Normally this would be a great thing for me; because I love the narrative aspect of the games but story is really bad, repetitive and cliché, almost intentionally. I mean it is one of the worst I’ve seen. And because of the story, you need to wander between two puzzles and waste your time. Not having a subtitle option is another thing. Other than that, there is music in this version. The music is decent but a bit intense for no reason. By the way puzzles are not that hard and play time isn’t long. Still, I think it is worth playing except challenges. DLC of the game which is a platformer is included in this version. There are ten levels – which are pretty boring and nothing new except a couple – and you try to finish as quickly as possible or with minimum moves. As you can imagine DLC is pretty short (episodes gold medals around a minute) and annoying, especially with the hitboxes.",5.5 hrs on record,N/A
76561198037246903,34,N/A,Recommended,"It is an old-school RPG game like the first game of the series. However, bugs in the game are old-school level (you can’t see some skill checks from item and you need to use bar, annoying loading sound, visual bugs, people who wouldn’t surrender when they have to, etc.). Plus, the game feels half-finished in many aspects and it is half-finished at some parts like impossible safes, losing the water mechanic at the second part without an explanation. Unfortunately, having a Director’s Cut without fixing these problems makes everything even worse. At least, they did not sell any DLCs. Even though game isn’t really old, there is no sneak option and you are forced to fight in most of the situations. Other than that, NPCs don’t comment on many important things in the game like arrested guy situation. Difficulty is another problem in this game. I played it at hardest difficulty but it was poorly designed in many ways. First of all, combat difficulty is horrible. Most of the weak enemies can one-shot you while your men are so weak and I do not why but you can’t hit someone from the same cover’s different side. Secondly, skill check spike is really bad. At one of the skill check requirements, requirement goes from level 2 to level 7. The other aspect of the skill check is randomization with critical errors. You will find yourself saving and loading occasionally, just to meet skill checks (after spending many skill points and giving up from combat skill points, definitely it isn’t rewarding). Numbers of hit ratio, success rate, armor rating and damage are all wrong by the way. Although, I had more damage and armor from enemies, they easily doubled my damage in most of the situations and I failed 5 times in a row at 90% (and many fun situations like this) at skill checks. At least, leveling via radio system is a good idea. However, there are many basic design mistakes like ambiguity of toaster items usage, lack of reaching to incapacitated team member’s inventory, easiness of miss clicking to loot at a dead body, rare weapon drop (you fight with people with armor, ammo and weapon but most of them don’t have those items), wrong cloth descriptions, inconsistent shooting before combat (your men can’t shoot at the same time), team members who don’t care about the mines they have seen, followers that you can’t dismiss or tell them to wait, movement at places like bridges, selling only high level health items which only people with high level medic skill can use at the end and fake walls (like Hollywood sewers). A lot of missions are inconsistent and don’t make sense and a lot of main choices are forced a bit much. I still don’t understand why the hell my helicopter crashed when it was out of fuel. With the style of writing, it feels too edgy. And there isn’t a lot of choices while some skills are useless most of the time. For example at the Canyon, when you meet the couple who are being robbed by raiders, you can’t say that they are with you or when you find a sick woman your doctor doesn’t even try to examine her, she/he just says she is too far gone. Other than that, if you kill people at Canyon without leaving survivors monks can learn about it magically. Plus, there are many annoying things like the prison event which game forces you to leave the area and punish you for it. Unfortunately, game depends so much on surprises in combat which becomes annoying quickly. By the way making every character model shredded like there isn’t any food problem or anything in a post-apocalyptic world is a great idea. It really helps with immersion. And cannibals are people who have pigs just in front of their doors, it makes sense, right? Of course, you can’t warn Citadel after the antagonist tells you all of his plans and saying he will attack there tomorrow. I do not know why they added many different mechanics while changing or deleting the existing mechanics instead of fixing the game. There are quirks, cutscenes, voice overs, graphical improvement and precision strike ability (which is useless most of the game at higher difficulties; because your rangers are blind). The UI at Director’s Cut is really bad. You can’t see the water radiation suit you have and charisma haven’t explained properly. Other than that, energy weapons are useless in this version. So, try it if you do not have any decent RPG to play, this game is pretty mediocre.",19.0 hrs on record,N/A
76561198037246903,34,N/A,Recommended,"Before I start, I should point out that mostly this review will be a rant about narrative of the game. This game is the worst Walking Dead game unfortunately. It feels like soup opera version of the series with all the slaps and over dramatization. Saddest part of all, it is not even good for a soup opera standard. The family is Cuban (they emphasize that point several times by the way) but weirdly they only talk Spanish in a handful of cases like calling Walkers, “Muertos”, even the elders of the family is the same. And guess what, one of them is a professional baseball player, surprising isn’t it? As you can understand, most of these character features are there to add a cultural/racial variety to protagonists (They already had the black and female one before). Motivations of other characters doesn’t even make sense. Just at the beginning of the story, they send kids to an unknown area, even though there is no real reason for them to hurry. Since it is a soup opera, most of the events are predictable of course (like Mariana’s death, hostage situation, etc.). Story of Jane is a big ♥♥♥♥ you to player, Clementine’s shooting of Jane while holding a baby is completely moronic and the AJ tattoo is just out of the blue. Tripp and Eleanor are helpful as a saint at first, then they start to whine. You would expect it to be opposite but apocalypse can do that to you I assume at this point. Clementine’s godly/awful shooting skills is another bad writing. One moment, she shots a man accidently while standing still, then at another scene, she headshots everyone in a distance. Immersion is pretty bad even without these badly written characters; another character can open a locked door that you have checked a couple seconds ago like it is not locked, a herd can catch up to a van easily, plot holes like Clementine’s injection of unknown drug of unknown dosage to a baby and the siege. I mean everyone is standing in the open against automatic guns, they attack a town with less than 10 people and walkers (you can actually see them). However, in an instance the whole town is crawling with walkers, they are even going out of the houses and none of these seasoned survivors don’t have a gun while they are under siege. Of course, they all die easily. Plus, no one other than the main characters are able to survive and no one tries to save other people. David being alive is a real soup opera element obviously. And the love triangle that no one asked isn’t even original for the series. It was at the first season of the TV show. You can’t see any character development for Clementine from old games other than hitting the knee. By the way, how the hell can Clementine can even love that whiny egoistical moron, I do not get it.. No one tries to loot the bodies that they have just killed for bullets and weapons, because who needs those, right? And of course, you are a baby sitter to these seasoned survivors in this game too. Other than that, game forces you to choose between some idiotic options like Conrad/Ava-Tripp.  Lastly, at the end of the game, Jesus comes back with a couple guys to rescue against a huge town that pillage every town around it. Game has the same mechanics as Michonne stand-alone. Other than that, modelling of Jane is different and it is really disgusting. Some of the dialogue choices are just for surprising the player with their ambiguity (like “tell off” option which makes you tell Kate will leave him) . Unfortunately, you can’t pass the summary part at the beginning of the chapter. Contrary to other games, there are lots of visual bugs and performance is pretty bad. By the way I love the hypocrisy of weed in the modern world. Even though, there are more people who smoke tobacco, most of the productions don’t show any smoker characters or show it as a shame but if it is drugs, that means it is so cool!

76561198037246903,35,N/A,Recommended,"This a short nostalgic game with retro graphics and 2D playstyle. Graphics are pretty cute and animations are coherent with that. Even though music is a bit limited, it is good and it is compatible with the noir/80’s action movie style. As you can understand from the style of the game, story is non-original and it is there only for atmospheric reasons. So, if you do not expect nothing from it, it is not bad. The main part that the game shines is the playstyle. Even though, it is a bit limited and weird at the beginning, as you unlock more equipment, gameplay gets better and you are able to play without killing anyone. However, without the equipment, there is no way for a peaceful playthrough (like real life I guess). Some of the equipment are pretty useless but if you think the length of the story mode, it has a decent variety of equipment. I prefer mostly singleplayer; so, I did not look into co-op no more than one mission and I can say that I had no problem with it. However, I can’t see a real reason to play this game with another person. I feel like, it would make it harder to get As in the missions. AI serves well as an additional equipment pack.

There isn’t any strong aspect of This is the Police franchise unfortunately. There isn’t a real story, soundtrack is repetitive, tactical combat is limited, levelling is weak and resource management is just there to be there. First of all, the story, it is overtly not the main aspect of the game. It is just there, because it needs to be. It is for providing a concept but even with that it is bad. You are in a really small town with a huge crime ring. There are hundreds of people in this mob weirdly. You can’t grasp why are you working with a known dirty cop, even though you have an evidence against him. However, Warren Nash helps you until the end. Secondly, repetition. There isn’t any variety in soundtrack and there aren’t many tracks either. Unfortunately, biggest negative part about the game is limited and repetitive gameplay. Every mechanical aspect of the game is stretched. There are only two different types of enemies, less than ten skills and three attributes. Because of these limited gameplay features, you can’t do anything different playing the game. Other than that, there is a resource management part of the game which feels forced. As a vigilante you shouldn’t have a budget and an arsenal to fight the crime, I agree with that part but while you can loot the missions for TVs, PCs or video cassettes you can’t loot the criminals for their weapons or ammo. That is just plain non-sense. Stealth isn’t such a good option either. It doesn’t reward the player catching criminals instead of killing them – there is the advantage of not using the ammo though – and shooting strategy is easier (thanks to charging AI). On the bright side, there is some variety for the missions and there isn’t much games in this category.

There are 3 different kind of new enemies which is pretty nice and there is a new gun with bunch of throwables. As new mechanics there is a “glitch” one and trap mechanics, unfortunately both of them are annoying mechanics. For the boss part, there are three bosses with different skills but all of them have the same frustrating thing: Invincibility. So, you will try to runaway from them while you play the game. What a fun! Right? Other aspects of the game aren’t really well done either. Even though there are lots of new levels, game is offered you like a roguelike.

Although, when you are near a spawn point, there shouldn’t be any spawn, game isn’t consistent about it. Gameplay is mostly like challenge part of the original game which I did not like. Other than that, story aspect of the game is a mess. It tries to have a narrative but spreading 10 words (mostly it isn’t that long by the way) length dialogues isn’t definitely satisfying. This DLC tries metafiction and teasing but teasing part feels like an insult this time. And without a decent narrative, metafiction feels forced. Game constantly says don’t play the game, finishing the game has no meaning, etc. Sadly, it is right. I did not even try to finish all of the levels.

Graphics are still looking good for at a game this old. Story, dialogues and topics are naturally related to the cyberpunk concepts like existentialism-being human, morality, scientific developments.

76561198037246903,36,N/A,Recommended,"I played this game years ago at its first launch and after Steam launch, I wanted to try again but unfortunately game became worse. Game feels like a gambling system, at first you develop easily and earn rewards but before 100 hours mark, earning scrap and ore so slow, you can’t build a strong new deck from zero because of the 800 scraps cards. Even worse, game wants 25 games from 4 different faction for MMR and without paying money you won’t be able to build those if you have a real life. Plus, meta is beyond broken and there isn’t much to play as a deck. Because of the broken meta and slow progress you can’t try to discover new thing on your own, most of the people just copy-paste builds already which is another problem. Another thing is battle pass system that its free version is so slow, I am at level 65 with 100 hours of gameplay. Battle pass quests feels like a joke because of the variety of the cards required. So, you spend some resources and play for losing just to complete missions. The ranked system resets every month which means it throws you a couple ranks back. Again, the rewards for the season’s end is so meaningless, even for pro players, reset just annoys you. There is no ban option for ranked too, so if you are going to play against a hardcore counter, there isn’t anything you can do about it. There are lots of playstyles in this game, at least 25 different ways, but most of them are useless. And the rest is not good enough as toxic Nilfgaard deck. Unfortunately, most people are playing the same deck with same cards, just one or two different cards, and even if you win, you are bored to death from playing against the same cards. By the way, half of the game is about building a deck and other part is about playing that deck, thanks to most of the players you are playing against the same copy paste ♥♥♥♥. I can’t fathom how can people enjoy the game without thinking and building their own decks. It seems like the developers are lost in their own game and as a result of that, there are some details which doesn’t make any sense; like rewarding system (winning 100 games with a faction only gives you 1 key), balance, descriptions and achievements (description of the some achievements are still according to old system). Other than that, there are lots of tiny bugs, none of them are game breaking bugs but they are numerous and they are there for a long time. At least they are updating and adding new cards. Although, lots of these new cards are pretty similar to the old ones, there are some different cards with different mechanics. Still, some of the cards are just there for a joke and there isn’t even a real usage for them. Arena system and seasonal game types are a different flavour and they are fun to play. There isn’t much description for arena mode though, you can’t understand the details about the arena you joined. There are lots of cosmetics though, if you are into that in a game. Still, it isn’t greedy as other card games, instead it is the most generous one but sadly it doesn’t change this game is greedy too. And again, worse part is people worshipping the CD Project Red and its money grab. To sum up, if you are card game fan, probably this is the game for you. However, if you are not, it is so easy for you to frustrate. Edit: After the meta change, lots of decks became garbage. Again, people had to build decks from nothing. Having nothing until I can build one medium strength deck was really fun. And now Skellige is overpowered and of course everyone is playing it. So, there is no variety in game again, only last DLC decks.",251.8 hrs on record																					(103.9 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198037246903,36,N/A,Recommended,"Another dystopic game from Warm Lamp Games in Beholder universe. This time, your character works in a ministry and the game makes you grasp the spirit of the bureaucracy. Both atmosphere and writing (mostly sarcastic and pretty dark) is like the first game, so if you liked the first one, probably you will like this one too. As gameplaywise, it has mini-games for daily jobs, some old-school text-adventure parts for going around, a little bit of self-developmental skill system and for the rest of the game, adventure style playstyle. Unfortunately, mini-games explained insufficiently and it makes it a bit hard to adjust but they are not particularly hard. However, you can do great at them without understanding what to do. Still, these games offer some variety for the game.

Game mostly puts you in another person’s shoes, thereby it makes you think about your previous actions constantly. It has a pretty good fake choice system but sometimes game tries to show you the consequences in a bit forced way and unfortunately it partially breaks the immersion while something feels off. At the last part of the game even though, I helped Kenny many times he still talks about how I did not help him and he won’t help me with Clementine. At the same time, he says he loves her like his own daughter. By the way, at that time, his whole family is dead, my character is practically dead but Kenny just acts against his character writing for the whole game. Other than that, there is the Molly scene and the pregnant woman scene. Molly is overly aggressive against a man who couldn’t give her medicine, because he was being watched (not against the guy who watches him) and there is a pregnant woman who is overly dramatic against the rule of don’t be pregnant at the apocalypse. Although she just learns she is pregnant, she tries to kill someone to save it. Just to have a controversial topic, game forces these scenes.

76561198037246903,37,N/A,Recommended,"Unfortunately, first Fallout game made by Bethesda is really shallow (Still, it is not shallow as Fallout 4). Game feels like hollow, low-quality shooter. While there isn’t many perks or instances in the world, this isn’t the source of this hollowness. It is mostly because of the boring main quest and lack of side quests. This game feels like a dungeon crawler. If you want to spend time in game, you will go into dungeon, clean it and loot it, then repeat this pattern 100 more times and this is Fallout 3. You should know that dungeons are mostly a replicate of each other. Plus, some of the quests have forced dilemmas which don’t give you a choice or don’t make any sense. Other than that, the writing and dialogues have a lot of inconsistencies. Still, Talking Tree and Dogmeat references can put a smile on your faces if you played original Fallout games. However, ending is one of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ endings in RPG history. Prior to Brotherhood DLC, you weren’t able to send your mutant, ghoul or robot companions to turn off a machine which is in front of them, to save everyone and yourself. Instead of that, you had to kill yourself to save people or another human character. After the expansion, you can do that but game says you are not selfless, because you did not kill yourself in vain, and the real hero is your companion, because he just pressed a button. By the way, you can’t pick little unique items like Meat Maker and game doesn’t give you a reason for it. Graphics are same with other Bethesda RPGs and of course everyone is ripped in the wasteland. Because, no one needs decent food or water to be fit. Plus, even if it is post-apocalyptic world, there is no reason to live in dirty places with broken things. They can at least try to clean it but I guess designing different places were time consuming for the developers. Even though music at the radio is atmospheric and fun, it is really limited and makes you turn off the radio. Combat mechanics are really clunky like unresponsive inventory or V.A.T.S system. Sometimes your character just watches enemy at V.A.T.S or your bullets go with a weird angle. And sometimes an ally goes in front of you while your character shoot and then he/she dies. Sometimes your enemy takes cover and your character keeps shooting even if he/she have no chance to shoot. Unfortunately, there isn’t anything you can do to cancel it. While you level up, the stronger enemies’ spawn rate grows too. However, NPCs stay the same. So, a wandering scavenger gets one shotted easily. Lastly, the bugs. Game is full of bugs and crashes. Even if crashes are consequences of modern OSs, bugs are not. As always, a game left broken by its developer. Not-surprisingly, players worked harder than the developers (it feels like Bethesda always relies on this) to make the game better as making mods. Operation Anchorage The expansion shows the famous Anchorage Operation before the war. It has the game in the game construct as a metafiction. However, DLC is pretty boring and a bit cliché. Even though you can have your own squad which is a great thing, the AI can’t find its way and it is dumb as a brick. DLC lasts couple hours to finish and it has a couple new places, equipment with a perk. Mothership Zeta DLC starts with your abduction. It offers a couple of new perks, enemies and weapons. Weirdly, among the abductees, there is only one non-American person which is a samurai while this ship was kidnapping people for hundreds of years. It is just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ B-movie with science logic and other parts of writing. Probably this was intentional, because in this way they do not have to write a decent script. Brotherhood of Steel It is the only DLC that increases the level cap. Level cap raises to 30 after the DLC and there are some interesting perks but most of them are pretty useless. Still, it has great details like round table with water bottles, scribes with paper work, etc. You can see some consequences of your actions but still there isn’t much. The DLC adds Feral Ghoul Reavers, Albino Scorpions and Super Mutant Overlords which are just annoying unfortunately. I did not progress at the main story at first, I was trying to do a completionist playthrough while exploring and these creatures were just a chore for me. Nevertheless, it was the best DLC for me but again it has the worst, most meaningless ending. Why the hell Brotherhood destroys somewhere with great technology when they have already won the war? And there is the fact of Enclave had this technology before, why didn’t they use it against Brotherhood? Like most of the game it is lazy writing, I guess. The Pitt Another new place to explore and this time it is Pittsburgh. Even though, there are steel everywhere, buildings are no different than any other part of the wasteland. There are decent number of weapons and a couple of perks but only one new enemy with different stats. Again, the story ends with a forced dilemma which doesn’t make no sense at all. At least it ends with that and you don’t have to interact with it more. Lazy writing is persistent in this DLC too. While Asher knows you want his baby, he lets you wonder around to kidnap it. At the end, Wernher moved with me to the outside of the city without no one shooting him when he had already lost the war. Point Lookout Travelling to a slasher island and discovering it is an interesting concept but it is limited as it can be. While there are some “occult” elements in this DLC, it is nothing more than a boring joke/reference. Similarly, while there are lots of places at map, they are almost the same. Main quest feels like a side quest and definitely not interesting. There are some new weapons and some new enemies but these new enemies are tribal and hillbillies which can hurt you a lot. I have no idea about how can a hillbilly with a double barrel shotgun or hunting rifle damage someone with a power armor but they are one of the strongest enemies in the game.",147.1 hrs on record,N/A

Still, it has the same strong atmospheric tone and this aspect of the game makes it a beautiful one. Even though, the impact of the game isn't huge, there are lots of choices and many different endings. There are some good side missions (like Magpie mission) but there are lots of fetch missions or wipe missions too. Other than that, probably you will be overwhelmed with the requests of help from the factions. Unfortunately, NPCs are really weak and you feel like you are supposed to save them constantly (at least it was like that for me). With the high spawn rate of enemies, these kinds of requests became annoying for me quickly. Still, I had fun while playing the game. Plus, 34 hours was just for one playthrough (a completionist one); so, it isn’t a short game either.

Other than that, there are some important bugs which change your choices (It changed for me at sow and quarry choices). Even though the story has an implicit writing, it is immersive at the same time. However, survivor elements and day-night cycle slow it down a bit; thus, making the story a bit more tiring to grasp and easy to forget. I played the game completionist style which you need to do if you want to understand the story, but even with that I checked the discussions to find some elements I missed or forgot. Story is pretty dark and the choices are never pleasant. This foggy story provokes many philosophical topics like existentialism, consciousness, etc. Because the story has an abstract form, I don’t think it is written as a cause effect manner and there isn’t any certainty too those “answers”.

I can see now they almost used the same mechanics, units and background with Red Alert series. It is a bit disappointing that they did not try to find something different but that is not that important for me. The real problem for me is the patches and broken game difficulty. After some patches which are for the multiplayer, campaign AI stays the same. So, this means you can’t have that much money you are supposed to but the AI can get a lot of it. And with these resources, it will send units to your base constantly. At some missions, I spent my resources only for repairs while AI sending more than 5k worth of units with 30 seconds of breathing space for me. Even with that, I couldn’t win against its unlimited resources. At some of the missions, I’m sure AI cheats and some of the missions AI just goes afk. AI in this game is just a bad player with huge resources. By the way, I finished the campaigns on hard but I had to use game styles that I’m not a big fan of; like rushing and using only units not defense buildings (especially with the GDI). Another problem was GDI turret, GDI turrets do not work at their maximum range unless you select units one by one and you have to do that against rocket units. The game was frustrating and it needed a lot of micromanagement after patches. However, it is still a good game. First of all, there are 2 cylons and cute cutscenes.

You can choose different options for your playthrough in this DLC and you can have different chaos levels. In addition to that, there is one new enemy type at the first chapter and that’s mostly it about this DLC. It’s a bit short but it was enough for me after playing the main game. There were some medium level bugs for me, so you should check for the known bugs before playing. Hence, if you do not expect much about this DLC, you will be satisfied, I guess. It has a reasonable price with the Definitive Edition (especially at the sales).",0.0 hrs on record,N/A

It is another save the cheerleader, save the world game and nothing is surprising or appealing. Characters are a bit cliché, boring and predictable. Still, with the atmosphere, lore and gameplay game makes itself enjoyable. Different skills, playstyles and weapons provide some variety for the player and they are actually decent. However, even with that, the game was a bit chore for me by the end of it. Maybe because it wasn’t so short for a completionist playthrough. There are a couple different endings that change with your chaos level.  But again, it is not so interesting. Fortunately, there wasn’t any big bug for me at the game.

It is a pretty simple game as mechanics and the game is mostly about peeping monkeys and solving their puzzles with the information you have seen. While some of the dialogues and interactions are funny, some of them have decent writing. I enjoyed at the writing room especially, maybe because I studied comparative literature too. There are some details which put a smile on your face like self-improving book, foreign language interactions and the game making fun of AAA games. Difficulty is like an RPG game, hard at the beginning, easy after the mid-game. Sound effects are a nice touch and annoying at the same time.

There are lots of different guns with different playstyle. This was a huge plus for me. Jet pack was another variety to play during campaign and it gives you a chance to play as an assault marine. Voice acting was a bit painful, especially the leading act but most of the people seemed to like it. Multiplayer was still alive when I last checked it. However, leveling system is a bit grindy and there is only a couple decent playstyle to play while there are 3 different classes with different weapons.

For its genre, you can say GTA/Saint's Row style open world game's mixture with Borderlands style dungeon crawler. The story is hollow as a dungeon crawler story and its activities aren't strong as a real open world game. There aren't a lot of variety for the enemies. There aren't a lot of things to do in this world. You can kill some enemies, clear some lair and you can drop some items or skins (!) but why would even someone want to do that I have no idea. Technically you cannot change weapons in this game, your character has one gun. However, you can change characters from your squad and your squad can have three members in it. And they have different play styles. Weirdly, it feels like they are separated as tanks, DPS characters and utilities. Tanks are short range, utilities or support characters have medium range and DPS characters have long range. Additionally, when characters' range gets wider, they will be squishier. At least they have different animations (melee and jump) for each them. Game tries to be funny for the most of the times (even with the cliché characters like hooligan soldier, thief, mechanic…) but unfortunately it is mostly cringy, rarely funny (like Bieber). There is no minimap in game, so you can understand this is not an open world game. Almost all of the activities are radiant quest which are meaningless and boring. Game has really bad optimization and annoying bugs, not at the game-breaking level but ""this... again"" kinda ones. At least, I can say they tried to do something different, I guess.

However, there are some inconstancies about your minor choices sometimes at the previous episode summary parts. Originally the story is from comics and even I loved it (normally I hate mainstream comics). Details in this world (like Huff and Puff cigarette, Glass Shoes and etc.) and the characters were great. It feels like music and artstyle just try to keep up with it, nothing more. Naturally, for a game like this, to have a bug is pretty unlikely but it has a minor one at the end. Because I like to complete and see everything, I would love that the adventure parts end when I want it, like when I discovered everything in the scene or read everything; unfortunately for me it is trigger based and I missed couple scenes for that time.

Some of those layers are references to historical events, politics, etc. Graphics are still looking decent and there isn't much of music in game. Combat is a bit hard from the beginning to middle, then it gets pretty easy. Covering system is really bad though, while moving at combat your character covers behind something if you go near it.

It always forces you to fix something or provide for a need and you can't balance it until the end. At first, this kind of gameplay can be fun but as I said it becomes annoying just a bit later. Unfortunately, game has a lot of bugs. I have this game for a long time (before 1.0 release) and none of those bugs are fixed. Plus, with new patches and new mechanics more bugs emerged. Especially, space part has a lot of bugs. I think the issue about these problems, developers' rushing to introduce new content. I can say, for a surviving-simulation game, game is decent. However, it is a bit hard. Some mechanics are like just for engineers. The game doesn't explain to you anything or give you any information. You have to figure it out yourself or with the help of YouTube. And because I do not like to learn a game from watching a video, I used so much time to learn about game's mechanics. Pathfinding of duplicants are one of the worst I’ve seen. They are definitely not the brightest. By the way, you can’t heat the pipes. So when you try to transfer something like liquid hydrogen, you will lose so much of your resources. Weirdly, there isn’t a bottling machine for liquids either. As you can see graphics and animations are cute like ""Don't Starve"" (Klei). And there is some kind a story behind the game, more like a lore than a story.

However, some of those choices are really blurry, plus you can't see your mistakes quickly and because of that you can't load to correct it. I'm pretty sure you will want to change some of the consequences, because some of them does not make sense and they are triggering. Story of the game is obviously great. The lore is based on Nordic mythology and developed from there. Characters feels like they are alive, you can observe some of them developing or dying tragically. The story is definitely not optimistic. Trusting and helping everyone mostly causes huge problems. The ending of the game is really touching and you can import your save file to second game and those save files can change so many things.

I do not know why there is people with ski masks in episodes but it feels like something is off in that part too. At first you think you are the one building the movies but unfortunately your choices rarely change something.

I did not even bother to check though after that, probably it was from Google Translate. English subtitles weren't decent too unfortunatelly. It had a different text and some "".."" which annoys me a lot. Other parts of the game are decent enough, except story part. It is just there, because it had to be there, nothing more than that. Impossible difficulty was really challenging, even a bit frustrating, at least it was for me. I guess some enemies are always in a fixed place and some of them are randomly generated. Obviously it gives more of a challange sometimes. Controls were decent, and if you play on a higher difficulty, game takes a a lot of time to complete. Overall game is good, but don't expect too much from it. By the way game does not have the online co-op option like second game, there is only local co-op option.",17.0 hrs on record,N/A

There is no story in campaign like main game and campaign is a bit challenging. You have to turtle or first rush, then turtle to be able to finish it. For the main game, there is only story at historical campaigns and those are pretty short. Regular campaign is pretty long but boring and repetetive.

This game does not need the main game to work, so you can play it without playing the main game but i would not recommend it. There are more than 10 new campaign missions and a couple of new units per faction. One of the new mini campaigns is about Yuriko and it is a solo campaign which was great for me. Campaigns are a bit more serious with shorter videos and less flirting. I didn't play more than one mission on the challange mode, because it looked like there was no story in it and it was meaningless.

Graphics were great at it's time. However, it is still decent. Mounted controls are just horrible for this game if you are using a console. At one level, I was aiming for the killing achievement and i was able to get only 100 kills after ten tries and countless deaths while doing just one run. After that, I changed to keyboard and mouse, and I got 150 kills at first try. So you can understand the difference from that example.

Game has it's own currency and you can use it to upgrade weapons or buy them. At this game there isn't any horror elements except controls. Controls are really bad, especially with a controller.

76561198037246903,43,N/A,Recommended,"One of my favorite games, a timeless classic. Contrary to modern fallout games this game gives you a real freedom. Killing or helping everyone, a more realistic and satisfying writing even if it is older than 20 years. Game has lots of postmodern elements like fourth wall, intermedias and etc. At the same, it has a great sense of dark humor. For me, it was the most detailed game I've ever seen, contrary to new generation Bethesda-Fallout games. Probably Fallout 2  has more choices (I'm not talking about fake choices) and more impacts to gameplay than any RPG you have ever seen. However, it is a really buggy game, especially with the endings and some quests. I recommend checking common bugs and using more than at least three save slots, maybe using unoffical patches. By the way last major town is a bit rushed because of the developemental problems, so that town's text isn't strong as other town. Plus there are some content which was cut and for that reason there are some meaningless parts and there can be some temporary FPS drop when you move to a new area at the map.

Fighting mechanics are pretty progressive but at the same time, it has so many flaws like weirdly missing when you aim at someone. I played the game at hardcore difficulty and regular fighting doesn't make sense, you need to use environment heavily. Plus, most of the times enemies can one-shot you and parrying isn't normal too. I guess developers tried to do so many original things and they couldn't do any of it right. You need to crouch sometimes. I think the game is a First Person Fighting game more than a RPG.

Most of the choices effect the story but it is more like destiny's construct (like the name). However, at some part of the game, a dialogue is out of character and it feels like developer talks to you and unfortunatelly that part feels really pretentious and bossy.

It is a good adventure game with strong elements but story have some huge flaws. Plus ending and episode 5 is really boring. Even with ending being bad, it is emotional at the same time. Other than these things I can't say I liked photography, understanding of artstyle at the game. Especially with the pop-culture references. I can still understand developers' target audience but I cannot help feeling bad about it, it feels like it is target oriented. But I guess it is a personal thing and I do not think movie and other art references will bother you. Max is really annoying with her constant self-pity and whining. I expected someone who can create alternate universes like a deity to be more confident about herself. Her fear of using focus is idiotic actually. She starts whining after just one try. And at the ending part, she is leaving a whole town or Chloe to die without a real try, I feel like I should have more choices about it.

Combat is pretty unbalanced too. It's so hard at the beginning but too easy after mid game (I played on hard difficulty). Plus, some of the encounters are just does not make sense. Like when I was carrying some alcohol because of the quest that town gave me and after that some soldiers attacked me on the road, saying alcohol is contraband. Lastly, earning money is so easy after a while, and you can't spend on anything, but losing trust of a faction is really easy too.

76561197997004952,1,N/A,Recommended,"The game takes a little learning while you get used to how things are supposed to work like different departments and how they combine together and what should go where. After you have figured that out you then spend countless hours designing your own hospital  and that's where you get to experience the terrible coding behind the A.I (staff and patients). Restricted areas don't actually do anything so you find your staff and patients taking shortcuts in your hospital or entering areas where you actually don't want them to enter, and on top of that they can also walk through fences? Elevators can't be placed per floor but all floors so you can't send patients directly to where you desire. I prefer games where I can use my own creativity but instead you find yourself restricted in some building areas to cater to the games flaws. The game graphics are rather good but other than that I can't recommend it.If your looking for a hospital builder I would recommend Two point hospital instead. https://steamcommunity.com/app/868360/discussions/search/?q=restricted&gidforum=1696048426816523599&include_deleted=1",313.3 hrs on record																					(186.1 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198150437413,1,N/A,Recommended,"Really fun game with great physics and a career mode that is fun this far at least. The performance and stutters are horrible though. I often go down to fps in the twenties on my laptop with a 3060 in 1080p medium with dlss balanced when I otherwise get over 60. This must be fixed. This game looks worse in almost every way than dirt rally 2.0 which is the last game in the ""series"" while being much worse performance wise. It doesn't matter if they switched engine or that their levels are longer, it is still unacceptable to have worse graphics AND MUCH worse performance than the last game. The codrivers seem really bored and uninterested. In Dirt Rally 2.0 the codriver got really stressed when you drove really fast and calmer if you drove slowly. The codriver also commented on how the stage went. This all lead to the codriver Phil to have a personality and he felt much more real than the monotone and bored codrivers that we have now. In this game they're often to late or don't emphasize important calls like triple caution when a ton of other calls are being thrown out at the same time. This makes the game harder than it realistically would. The AI is also really bad. Using the same difficulty as Dirt Rally 2.0 I won a rally with five stages, where my car was trashed through the majority, by over 5 minutes. That is ridiculous as I struggled to be top 5 in the Dirt Rally 2.0. But the handling of the cars and everything else really is great but for me the stutters alone make it not worth it and a pain to play.
