76561199031454232,1,Shadow of the Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition,Recommended,"Not as good as the other two. The story is pretty uninteresting, I didn't care about any of the characters and the game drags on for too long. The gameplay is fine but it gets pretty repetitive. The only positive things I can say about it are that the graphics are great and it is very well optimized. This isn't the worst game I've ever played but it's just painfully average and is nowhere near as good and the previous two games.

76561199031454232,1,Titanfall® 2,Recommended,I used to have this on PS4 but just bought it a second time on Steam and there's a reason for that. This is probably the best FPS made in the past decade. One of the best campaigns I've ever played in a FPS game. Isn't bland like COD or Battlefield campaigns. Has characters that you actually care about. The multiplayer is extremely fast paced and fun. Don't have to worry about annoying campers (like the two most recent COD games) because the game encourages movement.

76561199031454232,3,N/A,Recommended,Game is fun for a bit but only with friends. It gets boring after a while because even though the developers are rich the game has not gotten any new content yet. It just comes off as very lazy as this is basically a flash game so it should not be hard for millionaires to make some new maps for it.,13.8 hrs on record																					(8.6 hrs at review time),N/A
76561199031454232,3,N/A,Recommended,I thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game. The story keeps you invested and the gameplay is fun.

Overall a very good game and I highly recommend you play it.,16.5 hrs on record,N/A
76561199031454232,3,N/A,Recommended,An underrated gem. This game is extremely fun. The movement is so fun once you get the hang of it.

76561198088342032,1,N/A,Recommended,"A big improvement from the first game, so if you liked the first, then you will definitely enjoy this one. However, the first half or so of the game is the best part of it. I really enjoyed the slower, almost tactical gameplay of this portion of the game and wasn't the biggest fan of the later levels. These later levels were filled with alot of enemies and generally faster, less tactical gameplay. The epilogue was also pretty boring gameplay wise, with about half or more of it being Doom Eternal-esque wall running/platforming. Something that the rest of the game didn't have and definitely didn't need. Some game highlights: - Gore and gunplay is as great as ever, and honestly both of these aspects really stand out here. - Level design is still not great, but it is better than the level design of the first one. Something that, imo, was the worst aspect of the first title. - Good variety of weapons. - Decent enemy variety that are fun to fight. My score: 7.5/10",16.7 hrs on record,N/A
76561198088342032,1,N/A,Recommended,"Worth playing if you want the full FFVII story, especially if you enjoy the games as much as I do. However, there are some issues with the game that I really didn't like, those mainly being the difficulty of the game and side missions. If you want a fun and challenging experience, playing it on hard is the way to go, but if you don't like playing/grinding through the ton of boring and very linear/simple side quests then you are in trouble. You can get away with skipping all or most of them till around chapter 4 but after that, some of the enemies, and definitely the bosses, start getting pretty tough till you're basically getting one shotted. Because I really didn't want to grind through these side missions (aside from a select few that granted me summons or shops) I decided to switch to normal mode in game options, which is when I ran into my next issue with difficulty which was that normal mode felt like easy mode. It got to the point where I could sometimes be looking away from the screen in combat scenarios, spam spells and be done with a fight in seconds. Most of the rest of the game was like this except for a few tough enemies and the bosses (which aside from the final boss were also quite easy). So would I still recommend this game? Yes, but only to people who really like this series and want to get the full story experience. And even with that, I would say wait to get it on sale like I did.",18.4 hrs on record,N/A

76561198088342032,2,N/A,Recommended,"Pros: - One of my favorite maps in the series. - Gameplay is relatively fun if you're a fan of the series and don't mind the fact that it's basically more of the same thing again. Cons: - If you're expecting something totally new and revolutionary then don't even bother, because this feels like all the other Far Cry's all over again. - The constant helicopters/reinforcements that are oftentimes called down on you when you are detected in bases gets REAL old, real quick. On top of that, they seem to arrive pretty quickly after detection, like seconds after you're detected in some cases. - Normal mode is really easy, especially if you play it coop. If you are experienced in playing FPS games, I'd suggest playing on hard, especially if you plan on playing it coop, and maybe that might even be too easy if you play it coop depending your skill levels. So far, playing it on hard mode, solo is pretty challenging for me. - One of the most woke and cringey games I've ever played, to the point where I sometimes just skip over entire cinematics or mute the obnoxious dialogue. This is especially true of what is one of the most obnoxious factions in the game, the Maximas Matanzas. An extremely cringey group of gen Z guerrilla fighters who are running a revolutionary radio station. Honestly, they have some of the most annoying dialogue I've ever heard in a video game. Also, the beginning of the game is filled with annoying lines of how the ""Yanquis"" (Americans) are racist and the American dream is only for them.  Finally there was a small symbol of a man's face that I saw when you are sending your guerrilla fighters out on small missions, that clearly is supposed to be like an outline of Che Guevarra. A brutal leader in the communist Cuban revolution, who also happened to be an actual racist and homophobe. Honestly, (as a Cuban myself) it's disgusting that someone this evil would be referenced as a symbol on a team you're fighting for, as if he was the face of goodness and freedom in revolutions. - I tried the dlc's out a while back when I had the Ubisoft subscription and honestly after finishing all 3 (not including Lost Between Worlds) they were not worth the time invested imo. I was bored as hell by the end of them. Verdict: If you want some mindless gaming junk food and enjoy Far Cry games like myself, then you'll probably enjoy it. If not then definitely skip this one.

76561198088342032,3,N/A,Recommended,"Pros: - Fun combat. Being able to hack off limbs and then link that feature to upgrades was a really cool and unique idea, which can really add to the intensity of combat. - Though the levels were one of the games weakest points as far as looks go, I think the setting as a whole was really cool and unique for souls likes. Cons: - Levels all look pretty similar and are nothing to really get excited about. The last level in particular I really didn't enjoy, not only in looks but it was pretty confusing and maze like to get through. But at least most levels in the game were not too confusing to traverse imo, though I have heard of some who found the level design confusing at times. - Limb targeting can get a little janky/frustrating at times. This could be especially annoying during tense moments, but honestly the game didn't feel as janky as many make it out to be. Final Verdict: 7/10 As a big fan of souls likes, I had a good time with this one and enjoyed the change of setting, since I am generally used to the more dark/medieval settings of this genre. It still kept the dark brutal vibe I enjoy from the genre, but made it sci-fi. This tied with the limb system and decent combat, made the game worth picking up and playing, especially since it goes on some deep sales often.",29.9 hrs on record,N/A

If you want a more polished experience then wait, but it honestly is really not as bad as some ppl are making it out to be, at least imo. Also, a note to anyone who decides to buy this game. Ppl seem to be having issues with playing this game with a controller and the devs are recommending you to play this with mouse and keyboard. So I went ahead and just went with their recommendation and I must say, it plays great with mouse and keyboard.

However, I think this game has been over hyped and really isn't as great as everyone says it is imo. I had a good amount of fun for the first 25 hrs or so, but I was pretty ready to finish the game once I was past about the halfway mark of the game. Also, this game had some annoying graphical bugs that drove me crazy, such as the water going black, water disappearing or the water would cause these strange rectangular blocks to appear and fly all over the screen. I encountered this every time I played and it still hasn't been fixed. So unless you're a big HP fan, I would just wait for a sale and now looking back I wouldn't spend more than $25 on this game, but that's just me personally.

76561198088342032,5,Grand Theft Auto: Vice City – The Definitive Edition,Recommended,"I am very disappointed by this ""Definitive Edition"". Many issues exist across the whole trilogy: many character models look bad and cartoony, some bugs remain, much of the gore/dismemberment was removed, Confederate flags were removed, some songs were removed from radio stations, and certain voice lines from cut scenes from the original PS2 releases were left cut rather than inserting these scenes back in the way the game was originally intended to be released. I think it's ridiculous that Rockstar is now concerned with not offending people when this whole series became popular and made them millions due to it's gritty and offensive nature. Censorship destroys art and NEVER improves it. If you can't handle this kind of content then go play something else, this was rated M for a reason. Now I'm not going to sit here and lie to you and say I'm not enjoying myself, because the core of these games is still here and these are some of my favorite games of all time. Also, a few character models here and there look good/decent and so do some of the graphical improvements. And I am enjoying the fact that achievements were added along with checkpoints (which help in some of the longer/more frustrating missions). But if you don't care about these additions and have the ability to play the original versions then I would suggest you go ahead skip this edition.

76561198088342032,6,Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales,Recommended,"Positives: -Game play: Zipping through the city is fun and smooth with equally smooth and enjoyable combat. The stealth was also pretty well done. - Performance and graphics: Personally I experienced no crashes except for one random crash towards the end of my experience with the game and only some small map bugs. Such as some of the activities' info on the map wouldn't pop up at times or the letters would be jumbled together. The load times in this game are some the fastest I've ever encountered in gaming. Lastly, the game runs and looks fantastic. My PC is decent, nothing crazy, so I had to run it on low to mid settings. But even on these settings, the game looked great and the frame rate was always really smooth and stayed above 60 fps. Negatives: - Price: $50 for what is essentially a dlc with a story that you can complete in about 6 hours is ridiculous imo. If you do all the side quests and a bunch of the side activities you can get more time out of it, but at most I would pay $25 for this. By the time I had reached 94% completion I was pretty burned out and done with this game. - Story: Story wise, it was just ok, I wasn't really impressed. And there was a woke vibe running through the game, which though not too in your face was definitely present and annoying if you pay attention. -Enemies: Some of the characters and the main antagonists were where this game really fell apart and ruined a big part of the experience for me. A large chunk of the enemies were actually decent imo and I thought the intro with Rhino was actually pretty cool, but ""The Underground"" faction of enemies and their leader sucked and they are supposed to be the main antagonists of the game. I really didn't enjoy playing a large part of the game fighting really lame looking neon purple Gen Z cyberpunk kids. None of them, except for the heavy shield enemies, look remotely intimidating, but instead look like a bunch of angry college kids in futuristic neon purple outfits. And as for their leader the Tinkerer, I hated this character just as much, since she was just as lame as the rest of her crew. - Characters: Most were decent and some I actually liked, such as Miles' uncle. But when it came to your best friend Ganke and the main character himself, Miles Morales, I could not stand them and I hated most of their sense of humor. Miles I found to be particularly annoying especially due to his high pitched, whiny voice acting. Am I playing as a 17 year old or an obnoxious little kid with a high pitched voice? When your main characters and antagonists are this bad, that is a big issue. Verdict: This game is not bad, but it's not great either. Obviously I'm in the minority here so you may really like it because it does have some good things going for it, but some of these characters and enemies just didn't do it for me at all.

76561198088342032,6,Project Warlock II,Recommended,"Fantastic game so far and though unfinished and unpopular opinion, I actually enjoyed this one much more than the first. - Runs great and I only remember maybe one crash the entire time. - Game play is really fun and the gore is fantastic. - Level/enemy design is good. - Only 5 weapons so far, but I enjoyed them and their upgrades. - And the one thing I was very happy about with this game that the first game lacked was that this game presented a good challenge to me on the higher difficulties. The biggest complaint I had with the first PW was that it was incredibly easy, at least imo, even on the highest difficulty and I'm not even that great of an FPS gamer. Even in its early access state I think this game is great and definitely worth getting, especially if you can get it on sale. Buy it and support the devs!

76561198088342032,6,The Citadel,Recommended,"The game play and the gore in this game are fantastic. Blood, gore and destruction litter the landscape and it looks/feels great when the battle is over. Also, the guns are cool and the enemy design is decent. BUT it definitely has its fair share of issues. - The levels really look much too similar/bland with a bunch of tiles of the same color, to the point where it really detracts from the experience after a while. - English translation is poor, but at least you can get the point they are trying to get across for the story (which is all text based, no voice acting aside from the death throes of enemies). - Also, there is a grab ledge mechanic that the game has that can be pretty bad and unresponsive, to the point where it may lead to your death a few times. An example is the god awful level called ""Sinking City"". There is a part of this level which requires you (I found no other alternate path, maybe I missed it and am just stupid, idk) to make a sprint jump and then grab onto a ledge in order to proceed, but because of this atrocious ledge grab mechanic you may fall to your death many times, as I did. Honestly, I had to put down the game for a while just because of this terrible level. - I also experienced a few crashes here and there. One day, it crashed 3 times within the span of 20 minutes. - Lastly, the upgrade system is pretty poor. I once as a test bought the same gun upgrade 3 times in a row and I received no added benefit as far as I can tell. The purchase menu doesn't let you know what upgrades you've bought and then allows you to buy duplicate upgrades for no reason. Ik I make the game sound bad, but overall this is not a bad game.

Also, the Friend's Pass co-op works well and we had no issues when playing this in online co-op. Just make sure you give your friend the game key that pops up when you boot up your copy of the Friend's Pass so they can activate it in their Steam account (only one key available and you cannot give this to 2 friends I believe). Then just make sure you have the base game (I think) and the Friend's Pass downloaded and your friend only needs to have the Friend's Pass downloaded. Then you will both boot up and play the Friend's Pass. Should work fine if you followed these steps. As for why I gave this a bad review. It didn't improve on any of this series' flaws. Such as poor facial and movement animations during cut scenes, very janky when walking around the environment, and some bad dialogue.

However, AC Origins was a fantastic game all around. This is my favorite of the rpg trilogy by far and one of my top 3 AC games. The game play was fun and addicting, nice graphics with a beautiful world, ran well, and I enjoyed this origin story. I particularly enjoyed Bayek and found him to be one of my favorite AC protagonists. He can be vengeful and stoic, determined to take out the men who murdered his son, but seeing his more human and loving side come out when he interacts with his son and wife made him even more likeable and realistic. Imo, he did not strike me as being bland like some others have criticized him being. I also liked that unlike the next 2 entries in the rpg trilogy, this game stuck to the darker, more realistic tone of the old games in the series. With good dialogue and voice acting and none of the cringey/light hearted dialogue and comedy that was often times present throughout much of Odyssey and Valhalla. When this game did have light hearted moments or comedy, it wasn't over done or annoying. If you are a fan of AC games but haven't played this yet or you just enjoy action rpg's then I think this is a solid game worth trying.

Luckily though it only happens on one particular map. One big complaint me and my friends have however, is the excessive amount of artillery/gas strikes. They seem to sometimes happen on an almost constant basis in some matches. Get's really annoying because rather than being engaged in the fight, I have to worry about dodging bombs or quickly placing my gas mask on yet again for what feels like the 20th time. One thing I would love for the devs to eventually add as well (aside from new maps) is new game modes.

I also saw some complain about the game play feeling too slow, but I actually enjoyed how everything felt slow and heavy, since most of the shells are wearing heavy armor and carrying what look like heavy weapons, thus making it feel more realistic in my eyes. As far as bugs go, I can't remember encountering any bugs at all. If you are craving a souls-like experience or are new to the genre and want to get acquainted with it, but don't want to jump into a more difficult souls-like, then do yourself a favor and give this game a shot.

However, I can't give it a positive review due to the MASSIVE amount of bugs. This game still has a lot of them, such as your coop partner not seeing a felled tree and being blocked by it unless he walks around or jumps over this invisible tree. At another point my coop partner glitched up high above the map after walking up some stairs and then could not come down. Or the worst we've encountered being that one or the other of us will randomly lose connection and then when that second player reconnects they lose the supplies they were carrying plus the sack or two they had equipped that is used to create extra inventory space. The only thing they keep are their tools/weapons. If you guys are lucky, you might find a bag with the lost supplies where that person disconnected, but you won't find the extra inventory sacks. Meaning you have to re-craft them, if the person wants that extra space. In it's current state, I can't give this a higher score than a 5/10.

Cons: - It's short and can be finished in about 3-4 hrs, but it was an episode for an entire planned series so that's to be expected. - My biggest complaint was that there are some annoying sections where the enemies keep spawning unless you press forward. Luckily this didn't bog down game play too much because it didn't occur too often. - Levels aren't bad, but they are a bit bland looking at times. - Small enemy variety. - Only 3 guns. Pros: - Fantastic gunplay. - Graphics when maxed out are good for the time imo. - I really loved the way an area looks after a gunfight. Blood spatters the walls and stay, dead bodies/gibs litter the room and stay for a long period of time unlike most games, and bullet holes and blast marks are everywhere and stay for long periods as well. Very satisfying and looks like an actual gunfight took place.

And if you still want more after the campaign, there is NG+ and some extra survival modes that are pretty fun to mess around with. However, although I really enjoyed the game there were some cons. - Random frame rate drops. - After 2 days of playing with no major issues I began to encounter a really annoying bug. Almost every time I would try and load my game after dying, I would load into a black room that I'm assuming was outside the map. I would then have to completely exit the game and start again in order to continue where I left off because it would continue to do this every time I tried to load game. Another time it was even worse because I was on the 2nd to last level and I had just killed that level's boss. I had saved and exited to main menu to leave and do something, but when I came back a few minutes later and tried to load my game, it would load me to where I left off, but it would infinitely say ""saving"", with an error at the bottom left of screen. It stayed stuck like this even after completely closing the game twice or it would load me into the black room outside the map again. I was then forced to restart the level in order to finish it.

76561198088342032,10,Christmas Massacre,Recommended,"This game is great, but definitely has some negatives. First off it has a lot of the things that I love about Puppet Combo's games. Dark, violent, gory, disgusting/grimy, cool story, some funny/goofy stuff, great soundtrack, and you get to play as the killer. Plus a great thing about this game and Puppet Combo is he is here to create horror for us and does not shy away from adult/controversial content. Such as going around an orphanage on Christmas night as a deranged child killing other kids and nuns lol. As for the negatives, the combat can at times be pretty janky and very frustrating, especially in some levels. There was one level in particular where I was stuck for a solid chunk of time because the combat was so wonky that it was hard to kill people efficiently before they escaped. Then to add to my frustration it bugged out on me when I finally eliminated everyone and did not allow me to exit and complete the level. So I had to restart it and fail quite a few more times till I finally finished it again and this time was able to progress. You can also sometimes cheese the game and stab NPC's through walls and there are some parts in some levels where there were cracks in the geometry and you could see into the next room. However, when I finally got the hang of the game plus then unlocked the ability to throw knives (about halfway through the game) and got the flamethrower, was when it got more fun and I really got into the game. If you are a fan of Puppet Combo, horror, retro styled games and have the patience to deal with the janky gameplay then give this a shot, but I'd suggest getting it on sale.

76561198088342032,10,GTFO,Recommended,"One of the best and most hardcore games I've ever played, absolutely love it. BUT this game really, really needs either saves at checkpoints or more frequent checkpoints. Each run has taken me and my team about 4 hours, more or less which makes finishing runs and completing the game very difficult given the fact that me and my team mates are adults with busy lives. We're on the last 4 runs and don't know if we will even be able to finish the game at this point, we honestly can't put aside hours of our days in order to finish the game. If this game had more checkpoints in each level then we could at least shave down an hour or two from each run. Having one checkpoint halfway through a run on a difficult game is just ridiculous and really takes the fun out of a game when you have to keep replaying entire chunks of a level over and over again. If people want this, then there should at least be a ""hardcore"" difficulty setting that has either one or no checkpoints.

Great/satisfying gore, fun Gears of War like game play, decent graphics, and the characters/story have that dark and rough/tough look and vibe that the old GoW trilogy story and characters had. Definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of GoW and 3rd person shooters, though I highly suggest playing it coop and having the difficulty scale with your characters or it will probably be too easy, makes it much more fun. The only cons I personally had were ofcourse the bugs/optimization, sometimes the game play can get a little repetitive after a while, and finally I felt like you got way too much loot. This final con was especially annoying if you're playing on the highest difficulty that scales with you because you are almost constantly getting better gear which really takes away from the excitement you get when you have just found some really good loot.

Update: Re-downloaded it onto my local C drive and finally got the coop to work with my friend.

I think big fans of the series could enjoy it more however. My score: 2.5/5 - Enemies feel a bit too spongy sometimes when played on hard difficulty (medium was too easy for me personally). - Levels were ok. Many of them honestly felt bland and similar looking after a while. - Graphics weren't bad, but the character models and animations weren't very good. - Performance was smooth and I consistently got 80+ fps throughout the game. - Experienced one crash towards the end of the game and had one bug where a character who was needed to proceed to the next area of the game got caught behind some geometry. I didn't realize this till later in the mission and so I had to load 3 checkpoints back and do that portion all over again.

Negatives: - I found some of the characters annoying with some of their dialogue. - The pronouns the characters use are from their fictional language and because of this I sometimes found it slightly confusing to know who exactly they were referring to when speaking. - This didn't happen too often, but once in a while I would choose a constellation that I thought would for sure be the answer I wanted to give a certain character but it would turn out to be the complete opposite answer I wanted to give them. So sometimes what you think maybe the common sense decision for a specific answer will for some reason be a completely different answer. - I ran into a couple recurring bugs, nothing huge, but they were annoying when they did happen. The first was when your game would be loading from the main menu and into the game play. I would see the cursor still hovering and hear the game as if it had fully loaded up. If I pressed the ""W"" key or any key even once it would crash the game. This happened several times and the only thing that would prevent this would just be to not press any button or click till it fully loaded. The second was in the smoking sections of the game. There were a couple of times that I walked up to speak to a ghost and then the game completely froze. Overall it's a good and unique game. 7/10",7.6 hrs on record,N/A

Hopefully it stays this way. What's unbelievable to me though, is how these AAA companies keep churning out more and more sequels.

The gameplay is fun, I'm really happy it has a co-op campaign and I thought the gore was really cool. However, in its current state I'd say it's not worth $15 and looks like an early access game. I played the first 4-5 levels and they all looked really bland/similar as well as the enemies. It's possible the variety increases further into the game, but I was just bored with it by the 4th level. Another big complaint of mine is the co-op, because trying to find and connect to your friends' co-op games doesn't always work. Whenever my 2 friends would host a public co-op campaign game they would both be able to find and connect to each other's games, but I never could find theirs in the public servers list. Then we would try inviting each other into private servers through Steam, but the game would never connect us to each other's games. Finally, I tried hosting a public co-op campaign game, at which point they were finally able to find me and start playing co-op campaign.

76561198088342032,12,New World: Aeternum,Recommended,"The game has potential and the pvp is great fun. However, the quests can be very boring, especially the side quests. They often follow the same formula of go here and pick this up, harvest this fruit, search these chests to find a specific item, or kill 10 of these same enemy types. At first I didn't mind, but after a while I felt like I was doing the same tasks over and over again but in a different area and then running back to turn in the quest and do something very similar all over again. Also, the voice acting isn't very good, some of the areas are a bit bland, especially the dungeons, and the music is just your average fantasy rpg music, nothing memorable. Maybe I'm just used to great MMO's like the original vanilla WoW, but I just feel disappointed with this game as of now. I'm not sure what the late game is like though since I am only level 22 and about 20+ hours in as of writing this review, but I do hope it gets more fun.

76561198088342032,13,Dread X Collection 4: The Hunt,Recommended,"After reading all the positive reviews and seeing what looked like very promising games, I was really excited to play this. However, it was a very lackluster collection, that I cannot recommend at full price. I feel bad saying this, as I know these devs must have put a lot of hard work and love into these games, but I just can't recommend this. 1. Hub world: Oh god this was a drag. Your character slowly walks around the map (no sprint available) accomplishing the various boring objectives. There is no action or enemies, at least from what I saw because it was so boring I couldn't even make myself finish the final portion of it (the portion that unlocks once you have completed the other games). To make it all worse, the story was uninteresting and the character Artemis, had some of the worst voice acting and dialogue I've encountered in a while. I don't mean to sound over the top, but it was literally that bad. 2. Axis Mundi: It tried to go for a Fatal Frame feel, with the ghosts and having a camera as a weapon, but failed to be fun, interesting, or scary. The level and enemy design (only 2 main enemies and one boss) was very lack luster as well. 3. Seraphixial: Probably the worst of the collection. Bland graphics and enemy/level design, along with very boring game play. I'm surprised I finished it tbh. 4. Rose of Meat: I gotta say, I loved so many aspects of this game as it was just absolutely bizarre, which is a huge plus for me. However, just personally, I did not enjoy the game play and parts of the map just felt way too cluttered with the many random objects and enemies/NPC's in the game. Many people are either going to love this one or hate it, I fall somewhere in the middle. 5. Black Relic: I loved the theme and graphics in this one, but the colors were much too muddled at times. It became an eye sore after a while and made navigating the map difficult at times. The game play was just ok, and there were only two enemy types, aside from the boss. 6. The Fruit: Ok story, ok gameplay and ok look/feel to the game. Some may like this, but I was personally left feeling very meh when I completed it. 7. The House of Unrest: The story in this one was cool and I liked the look and vibe it had, for the most part. However, the gun play was very simple and boring, and you use what feels like a toy pistol for almost the entire game and only get to use an AK at the end. A shame because it was actually a fun weapon to use, even if it was OP. Also, there is only one (very bland) main enemy type, a second tougher enemy type that you barely get to fight and the boss. The final boss/arena was actually pretty cool, but it was so easy I finished it in one try within 30 seconds. 8. Uktena 64: Finally, this one was actually fun and worth my time, definitely my favorite. Good humor, cool story, and I liked the level/enemy design and graphics. The quality of this one was overall the best in the collection, but I am not surprised because the dev for this one was Kira, the same person who made Lost in Vivo (a must play for any retro horror fan).

Cons: - Freezed at least once every day I played this game, usually within the first 20 minutes of starting or on the initial load screen.

However, it was extremely annoying to have to alt+F4  every time and hope it had auto saved if you were in the middle of game play when it happened. - I disliked how they went even more over the top and silly with this game (think Saints Row 4). I understand that this series always had a sense of silliness and over the top feel, but this one went too far. Sometimes almost giving it a sense of light heartedness imo. - Maniacs were boring and not memorable at all. - The last case or two weren't as fun as the rest of the game and the final boss battle was lame and repetitive. - Also, the ending felt abrupt and I don't feel like dishing out another $10 for a mediocre dlc that completes the story.",12.7 hrs on record,N/A

76561198088342032,15,Neckbreak,Recommended,"This game is great and worth the money imo, even in it's early access state. If you love difficult games, dark and violent content, boomer shooters and Hotline Miami, then you'll probably really like this. My early access score: 8/10. However, this game is not perfect and these were my negatives: 1) Some close up shotgun shots didn't kill big enemies at times. This was extremely annoying because they would kill you immediately afterward. 2) Some guns can be annoyingly inaccurate at times, especially the sub-machine gun. 3) Kicking is a little wonky and there will be times when you were positive you would land a kick, but it somehow missed because you happened to be like half an inch too far. Very frustrating because this often leads to your death. 4) There are times when when enemies will one hit kill you with simple punches, especially the cops in the final subway area. Personally, I think this is stupid especially if the game is not being played on hard, and certain shots you take only damage but don't kill you. Wth? 5) I hated the areas where you were high up in buildings/platforms and then you could easily just fall down and die if you miss stepped and weren't careful. I just didn't like that at all, and it was even more frustrating  when a difficult load of enemies had just been killed. 6) I noticed in one area of the game, certain enemies walked in and out of walls and would one shot kill you immediately after coming out of a wall. This happened at least twice. 7) Here and there I noticed open areas of walls (example, a missing crack in a wall at the beginning  of the church level) or a wall that would be randomly missing (one room in the mansion level) where you could see the open sky box. 8) Finally, this was particularly annoying, since this level was pretty difficult. I cleared everyone except one cop up on the second floor of the final subway area and then as I was running up one of the stairs to shoot him I got stuck on the stairs, which led to my death. I later came back after shooting him from the first floor and tested both sets of stairs that led up and I noticed this would happen about halfway up the stairs on both of them and the only way to get up them was to hop about once or twice.",8.8 hrs on record,N/A

However, I feel like the game is just too janky most of the time in its combat, movement, and especially crappy stealth. The jankiness is presented as if it's a charm of the game, when in fact it just plays badly most of the time. Also, the game boasts of being hard and unforgiving, when it just feels so unfair most of the time. Don't get me wrong, I love hard games, but this game just pisses me off in the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of ways. The worst are the countless and unfair traps that will sap almost all health from you, this has got to be minimized. Fast enemies that run at you from all sides out of nowhere sometimes, especially when all keys are acquired at the end of a level. And finally some long lasting negative effects  that you receive from certain eaten items that can really mess you up. If these problems were rectified, then I would really love this game. When you're not getting demolished in unfair ways and you are able to look past the jankiness, you can enjoy yourself. But when you are constantly getting unfairly screwed by the game, the fun just dies off. My score: 5/10",3.5 hrs on record																					(1.2 hrs at review time),N/A

Neutral: - New destinations were cool (except for Ward Prime) for the most part, but they all looked kinda the same after a while. They felt almost lazy and rushed. Cons: - Ward Prime, wow one of the WORST parts of a game I have played in a long time. Absolute trash. - This dlc was short and felt rushed, like they were just trying to cram bosses and content into as small a section as possible and then pump it out to make a quick buck. - The writing, characters and dialogue were terrible. It was uninspired and generic. - Lastly, the bugs. Final boss would freeze/stutter which would at times lead to me and my coop friend's deaths and caused much frustration. Also, there were rat wizards who would freeze us sometimes and then instead of the status effect going away after a while like it should, our screens would stay stuck with the frozen effect so you could barely see in front of you. This would only go away once you died or fast traveled somewhere else. Absolutely frustrating. In conclusion, this dlc is definitely not worth the $10, and definitely felt like more of a cash grab.

They really didn't hold back, thus keeping true to what Hell would really be like. - Movement feels smooth unlike the clunkiness of the first. _______________________________________ Cons: - Experienced massive frame rate drops in the arena mission, especially when the enemies started to flood in. Fortunately, the rest of the game ran fine. - Once, when I was looking through the armory, weapons, and bestiary it randomly erased the menu from the screen when I switched back into bestiary. I couldn't do anything except look at the background for about 30 or so seconds till it finally brought the bestiary menu back. - Combat feels too easy sometimes, even on hard. I found myself at full health for a long while on the first level and it wasn't till I purposely started playing sloppy that I took damage. Also, the kick is WAY too overpowered. You can kick groups of martyrs all over the place with ease. ____________________________ Neutral: - Something about the combat feels a bit off, like when I hit enemies it doesn't really feel satisfying. It's not bad, but it's not great. - The graphics look like they haven't really improved since the first game (played it on max settings). Doesn't look bad, but they're just ok. _________ In conclusion, despite the cons, I love Madmind's depiction of Hell so I am pretty excited to see what the finished product looks like.",0.9 hrs on record,N/A

The one and only issue I'd say I had with the game was that I encountered a specific bug at least 2-3 times. This would occur in specific areas where I died, mainly fall deaths, where when I went back to the area of my death to clear the guilt penalty, the statue you pick up to erase it would stay hovering in the air and would not be retrievable. In conclusion, it's because of games like this that I have not totally lost faith in the video game industry.

76561198088342032,20,Hellpoint: The Thespian Feast,Recommended,"This game has a lot potential. The theme is great, monsters are cool, and combat is fun. However it is considerably less fun than it can be, because of a few cons that need to be fixed: - Has a few visual bugs here and there, such as the blood would fade in/out depending on how close you were or how the camera was turned. Seems to happen more on local coop. - Rest point system isn't very good. I don't know if this was a glitch or if this is some kind of timer system after you rest, but here are 3 examples. I would level up at a rest point and then go out into an area that I had cleared and all the enemies had respawned as I would have expected. Then at another point, I rested and went back out but all the enemies hadn't respawned. Lastly, at another rest point once again the enemies hadn't respawned, but I walked away to go do something in my room (since I knew for sure the area was cleared) and when I came back all the enemies were back and attacking me. - Another minor complaint related to the rest point system is how my health shots don't refill after resting like most souls-like games. I enjoy difficult games, but this is just an annoying feature that makes the game a lot harder/less fun, since there are no healing items I found.  I believe the only way to refill these was after filling a meter that gets filled from killing a certain number of enemies. - Energy/mana and health potion consumable items would be a nice addition. Maybe they were in the game, but we never encountered them. -The game needs to be clearer on when you can revive your coop partner and when reviving your coop partner will lead to your death. Since reviving requires the game to remove a large portion of your health in order to bring them back to life. Once, it gave me the option to revive my partner, but this ended up leading to my death and because I was player one, we lost and had to respawn from our last rest point. - Lastly, and probably the worst part of the game was the clunky controls and obnoxious platforming. The game feels clunky so when you are trying to jump in certain areas, don't be surprised if you fall to your death. This happened multiple times to me and my coop partner.

I played this on hard and so did my brother and both of us felt the same way. At first the game presents you with a decent challenge that makes it really fun and addicting, but after you start getting better weapons and upgrades the game gets REALLY EASY. I especially noticed this after the first episode and even then I never died except when I faced the first boss. Throughout the whole game I felt like I was just easily mowing through all the enemies with almost zero effort and the only time I ever felt somewhat challenged was at the bosses, aside from that I almost never died. Eventually the game felt so repetitive that I couldn't even bother with finishing the final episode even though I was halfway through it. It was just way too boring at that point.

76561198088342032,23,Agony UNRATED,Recommended,"So let me start off with the positives. This is the best depiction of Hell I've seen in a game so far. It is horrific and brutal and I love that the developers didn't hold back and set out to make Hell the way it should look. A place of evil and torment. In this aspect I think the team did a great job and so because of this and because I'm a big horror fan, I'm giving this game a positive review. Aside from this, I can tell the team has put a lot of effort into the game and have been working hard to fix a lot of the issues the game has. I'm also really glad they released the unrated version of the game, because this is the way the game was truly meant to look. Now for the negatives. I'm going to be honest, this game is very flawed imo and I would really only recommend it to big horror fans like myself. These are the main issues I encountered: - Controls feel very clunky  and I felt like I was often running into and getting stuck on objects. This made the game much more frustrating than it needed to be and took a lot of fun out of it. - Dialogue and voice acting (especially with the Martyrs) was bad most of the time. - Graphics were decent, but there were quite a few moments when the game and a lot of the animations looked pretty bad. - Lastly, unless you take your time collecting and exploring like I did, the game is very short and can be finished in about 4-6 hours from what I've seen.

In Space Marine 2, I learned three things: 1. Jumping into a horde of Tyranids isn't as cool when they can eat your face. 2. Space Marines are basically caffeine-fueled, walking tanks with a hero complex. 3. I’m probably not cut out to save humanity. The first mission had me feeling like a god among men, smashing through enemies like a sentient blender. But by the third mission, I’m pretty sure my character was just angry that he didn’t get enough sleep or coffee because we’ve been slaying xenos for weeks without a break. The dialogue is full of testosterone and random battle cries that make me question if Space Marines are secretly poets who hate rhyming. And let’s not forget that the chainsword is the closest thing to therapy in the 41st millennium. I’ve never felt so alive. It’s not all fun though. There was that one time I was so deep in combat that I accidentally started attacking my own team. Turns out, Space Marines don’t appreciate friendly fire. Who knew? Space Marine 2 is like a brutal workout for your thumbs and your soul. Come for the purging, stay for the crisis of faith.

Still, the game with all of its well crafted mechanics still keeps you in there. The whole object manipulation system, the adventure aspect of the game is just awesome, it feels so good to play around with the environment in so many ways. I need to add this after 92 hours in the game, I realized something disturbing, they made male on male sexual activity extremely easy, like you just compliment a guy and bam you're in bed, while on the other hand women are almost inaccessible, I made lovers with Shadowheart and STILL there's no option to have anything but a kiss. DUDE EVEN THE EMPEROR WAS AVAILABLE with only a single dialog line, dont you think you're being ridiculous?

Definitely play it if you are a seasoned role playing game player, it takes a bit getting used to to get really into the story due to the original game system but after that its classic FRP / RPG for you.

Check the last part for after 30+ play review. As a seasoned Anno player I must say this game feels like a massive disappointment, the whole depth and substance of the game has been taken away. It's now a childrens playtime game, no real resource management, no real challenge, not even an interesting story line. It's just massive amounts of great graphics and that's it, nothing more. It is so obvious this is another game made for not-so intelligent yet massively pampered and lousy millenial kids, you do trivial stuff and you get levels bonuses praises and crap, while there's not a real game going on, this game can be played after a real game as you let your mind to ease and eat dinner in front of the screen. It's that easy and crappy. THEY KILLED ANNO. Skip this one. Let me summarize: PROS: + Easy interface + Great graphics CONS: - No real strategy - Not much of a resource management - No real challenge - No storyline ---------------------------------- 30+ hours review supplement: At this point I tried to give the game a second chance since I gave so much money to this damn game and forced myself into its system, turns out they actually put some sort of resource management scheme, in the old games you'd manage the resources in between the islands of a single map, in this game you have to do it in between maps which means you have to wait for loading and transition effects each time you visit a map location, the moon / space bit is nice but not detailed, the other corporations dont even challenge you, the graphics engine is not optimized either, you get damn frame rate falls, what else is out there ?

76561197977935089,1,N/A,Recommended,"My original review of the game was lackluster as at the time I was still fresh into my time with it, and at the time I didn't realize that the first 1/4 to 1/3 of the game was heavily front-end loaded with content. At the time, I was not bound, but somewhat obligated not to be critical of the game as I was for a few months a community moderator for the game,  I've since stepped down.  And its been several months since the game was released.  Frankly, the only word I have to describe the game is, an emotional dissapointment The world is huge, but as you exit the first 2 or 3 regions, the content of the game gets less and less.  Dont get me wrong.  When it runs good,  it looks great, its a blast to revisit the world in it's re-imagining.  And for the longest time the thing that had me most interested was the world state and the story. how things changed canonically since the last game. I wont say that I didnt enjoy it,  but I feel like the story was kind of a letdown. Very few questions were answered.  And I feel very strongly that whatever this game originally had for a script, was dramatically altered because of the invasion of Ukraine, Honestly I dont know what I was expecting but a lot of the main story felt like fan service.  It was a shame because the worldbuilding really did shine in some places. The gameplay was passable.  it was hard to get a handle on things when it was clear it was being hampered by bugs.  bugs like the A-life / Spawn circle spawning enemies behind you randomly,  AI refusing to use cover and acting recklessly,  enemies spawning exclusively with endgame gear all over the map.  When it wasn't bugging out or throwing Bullet sponges at me, it was fun. the looting mechanics and gear in general was also passable,  I appreciated much of the new toys but theres a LOT missing.  the artefacts were mostly great aside from the fact that they only spawn in preset locations just like the old games. (some areas theres static artefacts others it randomly generates one but its always the same area).  The weapons and armor were cool... the weapons were kind of a dissapointment in the modificaiton/attachment system though, I guess I thought many attachments would be modular.  especially with sights.  and I thought you'd at least be able to fetch some parts off dead stalkers sometimes.. the UI itself is more or less fine but the way the game conveys information to you is very bad.  if theres a reputation system in this game, I dont know how to read it.... It makes me wonder what the point of having all the different stalker clans is if they're all just passive to you for most of the game unless you attack them.. the older games had entire encyclopedias that would explain to you who the groups were, and they'd usually inform you too of their relations or attitude towards you. Political events in real life nearly killed the game,  multiple times over.  Its a miracle the game survived.  But unfortunatley, the honeymoon is over.  And the state of this game is not much better than Cyberpunk 2077 was in its first 6 months.  It has the potential to be great. But its going to lose considerable time to bugfixing and optimization, that will not be spent on new content. it will be worth checking back in a year or two.  Im not mad at GSC, I still like Stalker 2. Watching stalker die, return from the dead, and go through the ringer to get here again was a traumatic and emotional experience. Im glad we got it, it wasn't what I expected. But I still accept it. Until we meet again, old friend.",78.4 hrs on record																					(78.0 hrs at review time),N/A

76561197977935089,1,N/A,Recommended,"This is my favorite CNC Game. Bar none. and I will die on that hill. Its a game from 2007,  so yes now its old. But at the time, it had very good looking graphics, the color palette made it look better than RA3 which came after it, too. The gameplay was quick yet not so fast that it felt like you needed to macro spam.  it also had that CNC Generals layer where you would build structures to unlock support and upgrade abilities.   There were 3 factions which all had a very nice, and unique lineup of units and abilities.  Every faction felt fun in its own way.  There are lots of satisfying units that mostly have clear purposes, strengths and weaknesses,  there's lots of tech structures to capture to change the dynamics of the battlefield,  they encourage base expansion with the mobile outposts.  and there's still plenty of little micro-managing things to do with infantry. CNC3 was the peak of the series as far as playing combined arms was concerned,  even squishy infantry had a role and a use.  I recall many fights that basically turned into quick paced urban battles with all sides furiously trying to occupy and flush out buildings with different troop types. production wise,  Westwood may have been gone, but its roots remained,  they were still doing the live action stuff and it honestly wasn't bad.  the worldbuilding of this game was also excellent.  They do an excellent job of convincing the player that the planet is slowly dying from the tiberium infestation, and it portrays the world as an absolute hellscape with small islands of civilization still remaining. one weird design choice that I actually adored this game for was the fact that most infantry units come in little squads.  and many units had their apperance change when you upgraded them.  it was attention to detail like that that made me adore this game.  And there's a couple of really good mods out there too. CNC3 was the peak of the series.  I loved Tiberian Sun, RA2 and Generals but Tiberium Wars and its expansion will always be my favorite.

76561197977935089,2,N/A,Recommended,"Some people at Slitherin watched the 5 minute intro scene of T2, and decided lets make a game all about that. The game is overpriced for what it is.  Its a fairly low production value generic RTS that would have been commonplace back in the mid to late 2000s before the genre died. If you played a lot of Wal-Mart / Best Buy generic shovelware that filled the shelves in the 1995-2010 period.  this game will feel oddly familiar it has some advanced simulation  and tactical layers to it .  and it seems to have a lot of content as far as units are concerned with different factions.  but the skirmish and multiplayer is awful, there's only 6 maps in multiplayer, and 4 maps on skirmish.   and you can only play as 2 or 3 of the factions in skirmish.  The main antagonist faction really needs more unit variety though. Thankfully there are mods,  however most mods seem to be focused on adding units to the human factions, not the machine ones the main draw of the game is the campaign mode,  as stated theres very little production value, so expect warcract 3 style ""cutscenes"" with bad voice acting,  and theres one or two missions that are really poorly designed, but the rest of the gameplay loop is quite fun, it all revolves around acquiring individual units for an army, whether that be squads of infantry, or vehicles,  units that can be customized, promoted, take casualties and need new members etc.  its all handled with a fairly rudementary supply system with some strategic level resources and some tactical level ones.     Whats fun is a lot of missions you can be rewarded in-level with new squads from various factions that will join you,  and you can often find abandoned vehicles that you can fix up, and take into your army too. the skirmish mode sucks,  the campaign is pretty fun albeit with 1 or 2 stinkers of level design, and theres currentley a second dlc campaign as the machines,  supposedly there is a conquest mode coming along with a third campaign.  that DLC will be the litmus test on whether this game has any staying power past a couple campaigns... because its definetley got the guts to be a good, replayable game.",21.3 hrs on record																					(20.7 hrs at review time),N/A

This game has had some ups and downs getting here.  When I first heard of it, I was under the impression it was going to be a proper sequel to Men of War.  Eversince Digitalmindsoft took over the brand, MOW and CTA have been nothing but poorly designed skirmish maps and PVP focus. I dont know what happened, but this was supposed to be a standalone game,  yet due to some kind of licensing drama to do with DMS, Best Way, Barbed Wire Studios or 1C, or some combonation,  this game was forced to be a WW2 DLC for the overpriced , overrated garbage heap that is Call to Arms, that being said. Despite having less content overall than say, MOWAS2.  (GOH is focused soley on WW2 Eastern front,  that kind of focus is kind of a blessing tbh).  The overall quality is better. at the end of the day this is just another men of war game that's been the same formula for a decade,  but the animations and balancing are better, the UI is somewhat better,  and I personally find the gameplay more fun.   There isn't much in terms of singleplayer content, the campaigns kind of failed.  but the conquest campaign is enjoyable, and unlike earlier installments, it actually works and is easy to understand. One thing I have to say negative though, the AI is absolutely awful. You will frequently be yelling at the computer when your tanks decide to drive in reverse into the waiting jaws of AT guns,  or Infantry stand refusing to move when a grenade is tossed at their feet.

So I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. SR3 didn't really need to be remastered, the fact that it was held as an Epic Exclusive for a year is an automatic  thumbs down from me, too. Speaking on the ""game's"" merits.  This remaster didnt accomplish much aside from adding some fancier graphic shaders, and giving the NPCs, Cars and Weapons new meshes. The game still needs to have hardware level settings changed in order for it to run properly,  Cutscenes are hampered by the new models not having properly functioning facial animaiton, The real Saints Row game that needs a remaster is SR2.  Or even SR1, But the latter will never come to PC, and Volition literally only has 2 people working on ""fixing"" the former. (Now just a single person, IdolNinja passed away since this review was posted, RIP) as for SR3,  Remastered or no, I'll make the same analogy I make about a lot of games, good game, bad saints row game.

I think the map scale is small and awkward,  the battles focus on fighting over pointless resource hubs,  the combat itself feels fake as units just blast at each other for what seems like an eternity,   and the unit pool is very small. And speaking of the unit pool,  I cant support or reccomend any game that nickel and dimes dozens of unit packs out as DLC.

76561197977935089,5,XCOM 2: War of the Chosen,Recommended,"Im not sure why I never reccomended this, because WOTC is a game changer. There's a few cons I'll mention them first, Most notably - to the unprepared, it DOES make the game objectively harder, regardless of which difficulty you are on, you will be occasionally encountering one of three bosses that will improve and adapt as the campaign goes on unless you can defeat them first.  If you allow them to continue to improve, they can capture your soldiers, pop in missions at any time and make the mission even harder, and ultimately  trigger a game ending siege on the Avenger (On top of the regular UFOs that chase you) - the other con is a minor one, WOTC is fundementally a different Xcom 2. So some mods dont work on it. The pros far outweigh the cons though. - While difficult, your struggles against the Chosen are fun and rewarding, - 3 new Enemy types, they are a bit annoying though, - 3 resistance factions that you can recruit hero tier units from, all three of them are AWESOME. - Addition of the Lost, Zombie like mutants in some missions found in the abandoned, fallen cities of the first war. - The tactical game has several new ""factions"" that take their turns independently,  notably, Xcom, Advent, The Chosen, The Lost, and even friendly resistance fighters on some missions. - New Promotion system - Soldier bonding, soldiers can get a ""buddy"" who they gain new ability when fighting alongside - negative traits develop dynamically based on mission outcomes,  xcom soldiers may develop a fear of certain types of units, or even fear of missing shots, and panic when it happens. - Two additional music soundtracks for the game,  the original Xcom set is the best. - Probably more I forgot",0.0 hrs on record,N/A

I dont normally play these types of games, Hunting isnt something that really interests me,  I thought that RDR2 had a nice hunting minigame to the side of its main content.

Is what you get when you combine a train and logistics game like transport fever or OpenTTD, With a city builder.  And mix a bunch of cold war eastern brutalist architecture and a sprinkle of dirty communist pinkos in with it. In short.  It's a city builder and resource management game for control freaks.  You create a small collectivist republic, and when I say you make the country, you make pretty much everything.  This game has a frankly RIDICULOUS amount of complexity in its networks.  You have to build facilities for the people, primary industries, secondary industries, transport networks for workers, networks for off-work people, networks for resources, you even have to make networks for moving new vehicles in from the factories or importing from neighbors.... build, power, water, heating , gasoline and waste collection networks,   and everything I just mentioned probably has about 3 other support networks for each. and dont even get me started on ""realistic mode"". where absolutely everything has to  be built by construction crews, which use vehicles, and like 8 different construction resources. the good thing is.  you can turn off almost all of the complexity.  dont want to mess with water? turn it off,  can't figure out power, turn it off. my reccomendation is to play the game with power & gasoline, water, heat, and garbage all turned off.  turn off seasons, and  all in all, play this game in baby mode for the first couple of weeks. as you get more accustomed to how it works,  you can start turning things on one by one. to end all.

I haven't finished it's expansion yet, but its mostly given me what I wanted from it.

This game's biggest problem is simply that it's too big and bloated with busywork, like 25 regions each with like 1 to 3 hours of stuff that must be completed in them,  it's incredibly repetitive.

Rainbow Six 3 is the last REAL R6 game. Up until this point the franchise had a steady formula, it was a slow paced PVE game where you had to carefully save hostages, defuse bombs, and eliminate terrorists in an ever expanding campaign that often comprised of several missions tied together by a story, with some occasional side adventures.

THE GOOD - The world is familiar, yet still very fresh and new,   its quite easy to make yourself forget that this is calradia,  It reminds me a lot of both Game of Thrones, and Elder Scrolls in the different cultures and world features. - Visual package is incredible compared to the last game,  the world is pretty, character models look great,  if it wasnt for the UI you might forget this is mount and blade - The sandbox variety is HUGE.   I like how they have broken kingdoms into individual families and clans, with their own members,  this gives for a huge variety of NPCs with different quests and interactions with one another. - character design is quite good.  I like all the different themes of the 6 factions, I especially like how they did the Vlandians, Battanians and Sturgians.   I just wish they would split the empire up some and add some little differences between them, instead of just color.   I also like how every unit wears white. and their trim and clothes are tinted based on color,   No more Red coated knights in service of a yellow flag Lord.. - animaitons are sweet,  every time you kill someone it plays from a wide variety of relevant animations based on where you hit them, and what with -It's not perfect,  but the UI for giving units orders is more intuitive and user friendly now. -When they work right,  seiges are amazing.   throwing big rocks at the enemy, 10/10 - the UI managing each character showing who they are, what clan they hail from,  their friends, enemies, and family is all so much more useful... and on the topic of characters and enemies... YOU CAN EXECUTE CHARACTERS. OMG YES. - battlefields and explorable areas are huge. - reworked recruitment system,   ties into trade.  also ties into literal castle gang warfare, which is cool *Fights inside towns against gangs,   where everyone must wear civilian clothing* THE BAD - The game does have sometihng of a dynamic, radiant quest system for some NPCs,  while cool in principle,  some of the quests it sends you on are either repetitive,   impossible,  or broken. - bugged quests and worldstates,  in my game, I can't go near Vlandians because I fought them once as an independent clan,  Now as a Vassal of the Sturgians, I am forbidden to attack them,  but they can attack me, and my only choices are to surrender, or try to pay a bribe.  I cant make peace. - voice acting.  not the sound effects, but the half-measured attempt at adding voice dialogue to random NPCs,   do it for all, or none,  its weird when only a few NPCs have it. - No auto block,  even on easier difficulties the rate that the NPCs attack you is quite fast, and its easy to block with a shield but quite difficult with a spear, two hander, etc.   they really shouldn't have removed this - no cheat menu.  Yes, i said it,  I cheat.   you can turn on a few cheats,  heal yourself, teleport around, etc.  but there's no character importing,  giving yourself money,   any of that stuff.   It sucks not being able to just try the game out without grinding. especially since you run the risk of having your save corrupted. THE UGLY I have only one thing here... but this one thing is so signifigant that it dampens my entire outlook towards the game. The AI,  it HAS NOT BEEN IMPROVED AT ALL,  NPCs still swarm you, all spamming attacks, they are immune to getting their attacks tied up by neighbors,   they like to hold their shields up  and they are ALL OVER YOU. the result of many battles is , if you're on foot at least,  6 or 7 guys charging at you, all swinging their swords in a flurry.  forcing you to continously backpedal and try to swing an axe or something to the flank..  I just have to say that any game where the combat has me constantly backpedalling is dumb.  if they arent going to tune the AI to make it only focus on  like, small groups fighting other small groups.. then they need to do more work at formation fighting.  because the AI in bannerlord is just the same jumbled mess that it was in warbnad",315.1 hrs on record																					(20.8 hrs at review time),N/A

76561197977935089,9,S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat,Recommended,"STALKER in 2020 is in a strange position,  it's supposedley getting it's long awaited sequel, but it's anyones guess if it will actually become more than vaporware, and even then, I worry that the Trog Tim Sweeney will swipe it up for a EGS exclusive. Whatever the case,  the reason I say it's a strange position in 2020, is because I was never a huge fan, nor was I ever impresed by Call of Pripyat,  it was probably the 2nd best of the original trilogy,  but what made CoP great, was the Call of Chernobyl mod was created for it, which has been the single greatest thing to come to the franchise since it's final release. CoC was a testbed for other mods,  I briefly played a mod called Call of Misery, which merged MISERY and CoC... then I played a derivative of CoM called ""Last Day"" however, in 2019 a derivative, of that derivative was released called Stalker: Anomaly,  and this has been the next big thing for the series in it's post-release shelf life, Stalker Anomaly runs off a custom version of the Xray Engine called ""Xray Monolith"" and it's a 64 bit engine,  it's very stable, I only encountered crashes when I had caused problems messing with the debug editor..   The game is an extremely well polished version of Last Day, with loads of new features, community mods merged,  and even some new quests.  the new quests are mostly a ""victory tour"" of the Zone, since you'll be re-doing a lot of the quests from the original trilogy in one way or another. Here's the thing about Anomaly,   and why Call of Pripyat is a funny thing to reccomend at this point. If you've never played the series before, buy Call of Pripyat,   but if you're just an old STALKER fan and you want to play in a sandbox,  there is no reason to even have CoP installed anymore.  Stalker Anomaly is 100% standalone, you dont even have to own a copy of the games to play it.  take that how you will. There are some mods out there that require CoP installed,  but bar none, Anomaly is the most complete experience you will ever get your hands on.  It's the most polished version of CoC ever made",97.3 hrs on record,N/A

Regardless, this is a mostly excellent remaster.  the visual style is great. sound effects and controls are all more or less excellent too.  there's a few stupid bugs with the PC version revolving around hardware.  There are a few levels that you literally have to cap your framerate otherwise things wont work right.  but other than that,  I've enjoyed this game.

Skip ahead 2 or 3 years,  I have a 3080 now,  and there's also been many patches since my first review (I had a 2070 at the time) I can now revert my review back to my original opinion that despite Rockstar being one of the scummier companies out there, Red Dead Redemption 2 is probably the highest quality game ever made.  It has an attention to detail never seen, even in the games that have come out after it. The writing is on point with everything,  It's made me both laugh and cry there's easily a hundred hours of gameplay here.  and almost all of it is fun.

76561197977935089,11,Kenshi,Recommended,"Kenshi is kind of like a Rust server,  except all the bullets were used up Lots of naked people, Lots of savagery, and lots of slavery. Kenshi has actually been one of my most beloved indie games I've ever picked up,  it took a long while to really learn and understand both the game setting, and the game mechanics.  because at first glance I wouldn't have picked this up if I hadn't seen some reviews showing it for what it is. Kenshi is a sandbox RPG, both figurative and literally (you're gonna see a lot of sand). The goal of Kenshi is to SURVIVE.  *Seriously, something as trivial as being fed is actually a challenge, this is an extremely hostile, desolate and deadly world I'm not an expert on the game's lore. but it seems to me that it takes place in a world that was previously part of a highly advanced empire, possibly even space faring... but none of that matters now.  Because it's been thousands of years since then.   Kenshi is a post apocalypse game on an alien planet where all of the bullets dried up centuries ago.   Reverting back to a dark age where everything is made out of crude iron and steel. and the only weapons are swords, clubs and crossbows. The world is VAST, and it is BRUTAL. Comprised of 30-40 'regions"" varying in size, even the smallest take upwards of 10 minutes to cross.  and you'll have to contend with hostile wildlife, hostile NPC groups ranging everything from anorexic starving beggars to skin bandit robots, cannibals, racist reilgious zealots and Slaving Imperial Samurai,   And Kenshi is the very definition of a grind.  there roughly 30 weapon proficiencies, physical attributes, combat skills and trades/professions to level up,  and you have to GRIND to get them to be even on par with mid tier enemies. Kenshi is extremely moddable though,  I'm someone who shamelessly cheats and mods my games for personal enjoyment,  and you have all the tools you need to give yourself a head start in any way imaginable. at this point I should also mention that Kenshi is not an RPG played from a single character experience *You could do that, though. nothing says you cant*. you can control up to 50 characters in real time,  all over the world.  *up to 256 with mods*.  And with controlling so many characters, you can do  the same as you did with 1, which is to say, almost anything You can hunt bounties,  scavenge and sell loot, rescue slaves *or take them!*.  and the best part of it all, you can build your own empire.  you can build structures in almost any part of the map, you'll start off with only having access to  small shacks and junk tier tech.  But with research, good economic planning, and a bit of luck, you can eventually grow your faction to self sufficiency. grow your own food, make your own clothing, armor and weapons.  build caravans and trade off excess goods and raw materials.  buy blueprints for bigger and better stuff. etc.  the game has a pretty basic, but robust economy,  there is a resource chain for almost everything,  spare the ultra rare pre-collapse tech, which must be found unless you're playing a *cheated* god character,  building your own faction is the only way to make an impact on the world.  There are probably 50 some factions *many of which are just different versions of bandits and cannibals,  but you get the idea*... and you maintain relations with all of them.  kill off,  or turn in certain characters for bounties... and you'll cause irreversable changes in the world... manage to capture the leader of the holy nation and trek across the wasteland to turn him in to the United Cities?... you'll see a large portion of the world fall into chaos as several groups of cannibals and bandits now flood the plains the Holy Nation used to secure,  their very cities collapse from the power vaccum.

Sometime in 2020 they re-released the game with the dreaded Games for Windows live being removed,  this is a good thing. Unfortunately they now force you to use the Rockstar Launcher, which is a totally unecessary peice of DRM and bloatware that often causes even more problems. However.

I had no intention of trying to install the OLD GTA onto my new computer, but since it was fixed up I figured I'd give it a try.. and without going onto any more of a rant. all I have to say is that it works... The only trouble with GTA 4 in 2020, is the multiplayer is gone, and if you want to mod the game, the working versions of scripthook are hidden in dark corners on the net. other than that, the only thing missing from the game is a lot of music is gone as the licenses expired, but you can always just download some modded files off the net and restore them.

There's too many different kinds of gadgets , weapons, and loadouts to balance.  There are often too many players/bots fighting for the size of the maps, especially the proximity of the objectives.. AFF is a passion project that seems like it tried to be far too many things at once.  And frankly, the layers of chaotic complexity on top of what is supposed to be a rather arcade shooter have probably scared the majority of the players away.

Makes me think the game was launched unfinished to a degree. - Tweaks to the builder/worker are both useful and annoying I do like the game, but as much as I hate DLC I think we're going to need half a dozen more civs, and Civ6's equivalent of Gods and Kings.. will be interesting to see what the first major expack does.

This game from 2004 has it all,  In terms of gameplay, it's got both faced paced action,  slow paced exploration, horror, humor . the works. In terms of a narrative, the experience is pretty bare bones since you're a silent protaganist, but I honestley believe the Half Life universe is one of the downright creepiest and most disturbing out there.  When you stop to look around, this is a world where humanity has suffered billions of deaths from extra-dimensional invasions. and those who survive are slowly being enslaved and exterminated by hostile wildlife in the wake of the events of the first game, and an omnipresent prime evil in the Combine. Really nothing else to say... Like a lot of people this game was one of the biggest influences to me as a gamer.

76561197977935089,14,Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,Recommended,"I feel I can only write a review for GTA Online, as Grand theft Auto V has been left in the dust since it launched on PC, All of Rockstar's attention goes into GTA Online now. Buying GTA V is basically just a means of distribution for the Online component. I'm level 99 or something like that, I feel I've played the game long enough to have a solid opinion on it, so let's begin. - Base game hasn't recieved an update since the first weeks of launch, they don't even port Online cars to it anymore. And they have been actively taking steps to prevent people from spawning online cars in singleplayer. Looks like they don't want you trying something before you spend half a million GTAbucks on it only to find you don't like it. - Very few of the updates have added any genuine features or changes, most of the time it's the usual combonation of a new vehicle or two, a gun that no one wants, like the antique pistol for example, and some tacky clothing options.  For an online game that's technically been going for 3 years, there's been very little innovation. - The whole point of the game is to make money so that you can buy toys, and once you've got everything you want, and once you get bored of the missions, adversary modes and races, and get tired of screwing around in freemode, the game becomes pointless, just a never ending quest to buy more and more overpriced cars and clothing for no better reason than to promote your internet ego, and then realize that everyone else in the game is driving Chrome Adders and sitting on golden Yachts - Rockstar doesn't think when it comes to implementing game features, the bad sport system is horribly abused. More often than not I find myself getting ""bad sport points"" for doing nothing else but defending myself against an Armoured Kuruma full of raging teenagers who are killing everyone on sight.  Do that enough and all of a sudden you're broke, and forced to play in a lobby full of dunce hatted griefers and cheaters... not that there's any difference between the dunce lobbies and the normal ones, and on the topic of cheating - The cheating is just insane. it's out of control, Rockstar has lost whatever grip they have on this game, and usually it's not someone cheating in a competitive mode or a co-op mission, more often than not it's just straight out griefing.  Getting C130s dropped on you, cars exploding for no reason, having a gang of stripper NPCs with miniguns spawned on you.  And then you've also got people who spawn moneybags on others, which completely removes any reason for playing legitimately because Rockstar rarely bans, punishes or otherwise goes after anyone who gets hacked money, just the one who spawned it. They slap cheaters on the wrist, often using a strike system, the first 2 or 3 times you're caught, you get banned for a week or two. It should be permanent. There is no excuse for the amount of hacking that goes on in a game of this size - Free roam is a toxic swamp of internet tough guys, racists, griefers, hackers, tryhards, screamers and squeakers. Freeroam was supposed to be the place where you get to show off, and play with all the things you earned during your missions, and you're extremley hard pressed to find a lobby that isn't full of hackers, Raging griefers with tanks, or one with a blood raging argument going on over voice/chat. GTA Online is like one of the seven circles of hell, it's a circle of hell reserved for the morons and half-wits who get off to a toxic, unforgiving and completeley malicious enviornment. It's a shame, because GTA V isn't that bad of a game,  I think GTA IV was ahead of it's time, and I still enjoy it even though it doesn't run too well anymore for some reason.   but GTA V has largely been forgotten since it first launched, because in this industry, if an action game isn't an online game, it's irrelevant. GTA V: An impressive technical achievement, hit some nails on the head, missed some others compared to it's predecessors. GTA Online: A toxic pisshole that should be avoided at all costs.",800.8 hrs on record																					(440.0 hrs at review time),N/A

Tropico by nature isn't supposed to be a city builder, it's supposed to be a Political game, in other words it's a game where you literally make your own nation.  T4 gives you much more control and fine tuning to do these things. Sure, T5 looks better, and it's easier to place buildings in perfect placement,  but it fails at it's core concept. I don't explicitly reccomend either game, but if I had to reccomend one, it'd be T4.

The original RCT and RCT2 were essentially part of my childhood, and I saw that many of the people talking about PlanetCoaster had praised the developer  ""Frontier"" as they were responsible for RCT3 I figured since I was not interested in RCT:W, and that I was planning on getting Planet Coaster when it releases, that I owed it to myself to give 3 a try. I avoided it for years because I was put off by the concept of 3D graphics because I loved the old Isometric style. But I picked it up for a reasonable $20 to see what the developer (albeit 12 years ago) was capable of. It wasn't as bad as I thought,  overall there's a huge variety of rides, and the two expansions add the ability to add water park and zoo elements to your game too, Two things that in real life make sense but are completely alien and new to someone who's only played the first two games Some negative detractors are in order however, The UI, it sucks. it's a pain in the ass trying to navigate alll the tiny buttons that pop up on the corners and on the side, and building custom tracks and sidewalks was so much simpler with the old building system. this is probably my biggest complaint. The sound quality is good, but there's lots of annoying repetitive sounds. YAY, YAY, YEEHAW, YAY... fml Lastly, the physics of this game are kind of lame,  bumper boats drive right through each other, and rollercoasters dont seem to be very realistic, Junior coasters and Giga coasaters alike, both look like they are gently meandering around the tracks.

Abso-F'in-Lutely. $69.99 in my money, that's only a few dollars short of what I paid for the base game,  so am I to expect just as much content in these three DLCs as the entire game? Pfft. Wishful thinking. Right, Automatron, I thought the idea was stupid, Robots big whoop. But once I got playing it, I actually liked it. the amount of options you're given from the start is pretty high, and you can grab more robot components to build more stuff as you play, The quest itself is pretty generic, go here, go there, fight lots of  robots and raiders, etc. Although at the end of the quest you do get something of a neat hideout / settlement location, Although I'd rather call it a base, and not a settlement. It also adds more ""factions"" to the wasteland, which is particularly refreshing if you've already finished the main story and wiped out several factions. Automatron adds the Rust Devils and Mechanist Robots, the latter needing no introduction, and the former just being a raider gang that wears robot scrap for armor and utilize combat robot themselves, modified in typical raider fashion with spikes and garbage and the likes. But it's more things to fight instead of just Raiders, Mutants and Gunners. I particularly like the option to make new robots,  so you aren't restricted to modding just the new companion that the DLC gives you, but allows you to literally -make- companions.  Or just make some new guards for your bases. Once you've played for 2 of 3 hours and unlocked all of the parts, the amount of options for custom robots is absolutely staggering, and you can combine any legs set with any torso, with any head, and so on.  The only thing I haven't seen is the ability to do things with Eyebots, for all I know it's in there too, I don't know. THIS is the amount of customization and control I wanted to have for the Minutemen factions... SO, If I can't dictate the uniforms and arms the Minutemen wear, I guess I can always substitute them with a personal army of clankers. I've not tested it to see how many new Robots you're allowed to build, but whatever the limit if there even is one, you know...there's mods for that. Oh, and it's funny having your town patrolled by a bunch of hulking, hot pink, violentley beeping protectron/sentry bot abominations that are armed with giant F*** off Axes and flamethrowers welded to them. I don't agree with what Bethesda did with the pricing overall for the season pass, and I don't quite think Automatron compares to the similarly priced Skyrim Dawnguard in terms of how much gametime you're getting for your money,  But I still really like it all things considered.

I played it for an hour and ragequit because I didnt understand the fundemental concept, it's not like stellaris or hearts of iron,   you play a person, not a country. Once I got over that many years later, I learned to like it a little. It's interesting, and deep.  but I also find it incredibly boring, and confusing at some times. I'm still playing it,  but one design decision of this game completely infuriates me and I reccomend against the game because of it. One word.  DLC. I'm not familiar with EU4, So I dont know if it behaves the same way,   but CK2 has a lot of DLC, Fine.  thats fine. But what's not fine is that many of them tie new, vanilla features to the game, behind a DLC paywall. Want to fight over the title of a duchy instead of just a county?  That'll be $20 please, buy Jade Dragon. Want to create a custom kingdom that doesnt follow the strict requirements of de jure? Buy Charlemagne..  want to improve or worsen relations with someone through a simple button? there's a DLC for that too, its part of Holy Fury Theres a lot of other stupid BS like that etc. I own most of the DLC, But only because it was dirt cheap.

76561197977935089,18,RUNNING WITH RIFLES,Recommended,"I'm not sure why I didn't have a review of this already. Because I really enjoyed it, and had a lot of hours in it. RWR is hard to categorize.  If I were to slap labels on it for what it's similar to... It reminds me a lot of the old 3D0 Army Men games,  mixed in with some grand battle mechanics like you'd see in a game like dynasty warriors.  It also has several levels that are clearly copied from Battlefield 2. It's a third person / top down shooting game where you play the role of a grunt in one of the three competing armies, brown, gray and green.   Dozens to hundreds of AI soldiers will follow squad leaders around the map, trying to capture the bases and complete side objectives... and You start off with nothing but a rifle, grenades and your thumb up your butt, and you have to shoot, stab and explode enough soldiers to get a promotion to be eligible to use better gear... The combat system is very basic,  you can run, walk, stand crouch and crawl.  there is a somewhat functional cover system,   and the damage system is actually pretty clever. Rather than health points,  every bullet that hits you rolls a RNG for a chance to kill, based on the weapon it's higher or lower.   Starting weapons on each faction have slightly different stats too. So there's something of an identity,  not just red vs blue teams...   vehicles also follow the same principle as far as stats.  but they do use HP.  There will also be troops running around in varying levels of body armor who will be harder to kill...  as well as veteran and elite boss units running around carrying rare weapons.  you'll even get a chance to capture enemy weapons or intel briefcases, and bring them back to base to permanetley add them to your own armory. RWR isn't a very popular game anymore, at the time of writing this there's often less than 50 people playing it.  the singleplayer is good, you can play a quick match in a 2 way, or 3 way battle,  with several sliders for gameplay options.  you can also play campaign, where you side with one army, and fight to take over all of the maps in the world, progessing from grunt to general along the way. There's also plenty of PVP, and PVE potential in this game. It's currentley $5 as of writing,  I say it's still worth full price. It's also one of the few games I've published mods for, due to its simple voxel model nature.

76561197977935089,22,Men of War™,Recommended,"While most of the ""good games"" come from big fancy American, Canadian and British companies,  Games that come from places like Russia, Poland and Ukraine are generally looked down upon. Men of War is one of those games from Eastern Europe.  And like Stalker and Metro 2033, this game is surprisingly good for being developed by a small Ukrainian based company. This is a really strange RTS/RPGS/FPS Hybrid.  It's mainly a stragety game but it involves RPG elements like inventory management and such, theres also some features in there to take control of individual untis like an action game. The editor is fairly easy to use and the battles are extremley realistic, but fun at the same time.  If you can get used to the controls and how everything works, I highly reccommend tihs game to pretty much anyone who enjoys any kind of combat game.",199.0 hrs on record																					(199.0 hrs at review time),N/A

Killing floor kind of ruined the UK setting for me.
