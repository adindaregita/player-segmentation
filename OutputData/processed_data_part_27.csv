76561198041304371,220,Half-Life 2,1.8833333333333333,Action,4,"A monumental game in my gaming career, Half-Life 2 was that defining experience that made me realise I was in for something next level. For the first time i picked it up on The Orange Box in 2008, and from the moment I booted it up, I knew I was in for a wild ride. It wasn’t just a game—it was an event. The environments were absolutely massive, the atmosphere was unreal, and the soundtrack? Edgy as hell. Every moment felt like a cinematic journey.

In Half-Life 2, you play as Gordon Freeman, arguably one of the most reluctant action heroes in gaming. You awaken from stasis, burdened with the trauma of the previous game, and are immediately thrust into action as the figurehead of an uprising. This isn’t a simple revolution—it’s a battle against a multiversal alien threat, shrouded in dystopian themes and orchestrated by secretive organizations manipulating events behind the scenes.

Set in a world dominated by the Combine, an alien regime that combines interdimensional authoritarianism with advanced technology, you must navigate a planet under their control. Armed with little more than a crowbar and your signature nonverbalism, Gordon becomes the key figure in the resistance. As you progress, you'll engage in intense combat, solve puzzles, explore diverse environments, and uncover the unsettling truth that nothing in this world is as it seems.

And let’s talk about The G-Man—a mysterious, interdimensional CIA glowman who pops up like a bad dream and probably controls the entire charade like a cosmic puppeteer. Is he good? Is he bad? Is he just playing the long game? Who knows, but he’s definitely got his hand in everything, watching Gordon like a hawk, pulling strings like an invisible god. 

You’d think it’s just a sci-fi conspiracy, but after a while, you start questioning if anyone really knows what the hell is going on. Does G-Man even have a purpose, or is he just a cosmic observer who gets his kicks out of watching a man with a crowbar take on the end of the world?

The game’s narrative feels like a giant puzzle, and each step forward opens up even more questions, all while you’re tearing through enemy lines, trying to get answers. And the best part? It’s not all about combat—there are puzzles to solve, mysteries to uncover, and a sense of isolation that keeps you on edge, constantly wondering who or what will show up next. The pacing is incredible, making you feel like you’re a tiny piece of something far larger, with consequences that span across dimensions.

Now when the episodes are combines (haha) The user experience is smooth and now it is even moddable! 5/5 | 之前20周年更新开发者评论模式后我又打了一遍，阀是怎样做到的，让我反复爱上它们的游戏。在游戏里跟开发者评论一起探索是我最喜欢的事，我喜欢看游戏开发历程和小故事，实在是让人大开眼界。
为什么这个滑梯不能上去，这个跷跷板是可以玩的，原来这里也有小巧思，这里的电线是视觉引导物，怎样保持一个休闲和紧张的平衡，能在游戏里亲自上手跟看GDC或者工具箱是完全不一样的体验，我会贪婪地希望每一个我喜欢的游戏都添加开发者评论。 | ""Half-Life 2"" is one of the most influential and groundbreaking first-person shooters ever made. Released in 2004 by Valve, it redefined what players could expect from a video game in terms of both storytelling and gameplay. The game’s narrative is immersive, unfolding without traditional cutscenes, which allows the player to feel like they are truly part of the story. The protagonist, Gordon Freeman, is a silent hero who navigates through a dystopian world filled with alien invaders and oppressive human forces. This unique approach to storytelling pulls the player into the game’s world, making every action feel meaningful.

The physics engine in ""Half-Life 2"" was revolutionary for its time. The way objects interact with the environment feels natural and intuitive, and it became a major part of the gameplay. From solving puzzles using physics to creatively using the environment as a weapon, it was an innovation that influenced many games that followed. The gravity gun, which allows players to manipulate objects in real-time, is still one of the most memorable and fun weapons in gaming history.

The level design in ""Half-Life 2"" is another standout feature. The game introduces players to varied environments, from the dark, industrial city of City 17 to the eerie, remote marshlands. Each location feels carefully crafted, with attention to detail that makes the world feel alive. The pacing is also masterful, alternating between moments of intense combat and slower, atmospheric sequences that allow the player to soak in the environment and story.

The AI in ""Half-Life 2"" was also ahead of its time. Enemies behave intelligently, using cover, working together, and reacting to the player’s actions in a way that makes combat more dynamic and challenging. The enemy variety, from the terrifying Combine soldiers to the creepy headcrabs, keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging. The interactions with NPCs and the world around you help build a sense of tension and immersion, keeping you on edge throughout the experience.

The game's soundtrack, composed by Kelly Bailey, perfectly complements the atmosphere, using subtle but effective music to enhance both the action and the quieter moments. The sound design is top-notch, with ambient sounds adding to the immersion, whether you're in a busy city street or exploring a deserted warehouse.

Ultimately, ""Half-Life 2"" is a masterpiece that still holds up to this day. Its innovative gameplay, storytelling, and technical achievements make it a game that set a new standard for the industry. It’s a game that’s not just fun to play, but one that’s easy to appreciate for the way it shaped the future of video games. Even though it’s been years since its release, ""Half-Life 2"" remains a classic that continues to inspire both players and developers alike.

Half-Life: Deathmatch: Source is a multiplayer first-person shooter developed by Valve. It is a remake of the classic Half-Life deathmatch mode, utilizing the Source engine. The game combines the fast-paced action of traditional deathmatch with updated graphics and more fluid movement mechanics. While it successfully brings new life to the original concept, some mechanical issues and a niche player base prevent it from being as popular as its predecessors.

What Works Well?
🎮 Classic Deathmatch Gameplay
The core of Half-Life: Deathmatch is its tight, fast-paced combat. It stays true to the original deathmatch mode, offering classic weapons, high-speed action, and simple, enjoyable mechanics. The formula remains as fun today as it was when first introduced.

🌆 Updated Graphics with Source Engine
The move to the Source engine has significantly improved the visuals compared to the original. The lighting, textures, and models are much sharper, breathing new life into the iconic Half-Life universe. The environments feel more immersive, and physics interactions are more dynamic.

🔫 Familiar Weapon Set
Players have access to a variety of classic weapons from the Half-Life series, including the crowbar, shotgun, and crossbow, all of which perform as expected. Each weapon has its own strategic value, and they all function well within the confines of the deathmatch setting.

🛠️ Modding Support and Custom Servers
As with other Source engine games, Deathmatch: Source allows for a robust modding community. Players can easily find custom servers and user-created content, from new maps to modified gameplay modes, keeping the experience fresh.

What Could Be Better?
❌ Limited Popularity and Player Base
Despite its solid foundation, Half-Life: Deathmatch: Source suffers from a relatively small player base. As newer games in the genre continue to dominate, it can be difficult to find active matches, especially in more niche servers.

❌ Physics Can Feel Clunky
While the Source engine improved many aspects of the game, some of the physics—especially in terms of movement—can feel a little awkward compared to modern shooters. The transition to 3D space feels a bit more restrictive than anticipated, particularly when compared to the fluidity of more modern games.

❌ No Significant Gameplay Innovation
While the updated graphics and better physics are great, Deathmatch: Source doesn't introduce any major changes to the original formula. It feels more like a polished port rather than a revolutionary step forward for the genre. Players expecting something drastically new may be disappointed.

❌ Lack of Meaningful Progression
Like many classic deathmatch games, there’s a lack of meaningful progression or any form of unlockable content. While this keeps the focus on pure skill-based play, some players may miss the more modern systems that reward long-term engagement.

Conclusion
Half-Life: Deathmatch: Source is a solid multiplayer shooter for fans of the classic Half-Life experience. Its updated visuals and iconic weapons deliver the fun, high-speed action that fans love, but its small player base and lack of major innovation hold it back from achieving greater popularity. If you’re looking for nostalgic deathmatch action or enjoy modding, it’s a great choice, but don’t expect a revolutionary experience.

Rating: 7/10 – Fun for fans of classic shooters, but somewhat limited by its age and player base. 🎮💥 | It’s good and there are still servers if ur in europe buy it if ur not in eu you’ll probably have shit connection so don’t | 这老东西没人玩了，只能选人数不到两位数的服务器进去小玩一下。

I have since it was originally released...however...the crashing...honestly...

I have the crash patch, but for some reason, the game keeps crashing.

I don't usually rant, but I just finished a go-kart race, and completed the date with Pinky at the Carnival and I have to do that over again, because the game froze and died.

You need to install a custom community made patch to properly allocate the game's memory to prevent it from crashing. Even then, the game still crashes pretty frequently. The controls are also pretty rough on PC port. That being said, the missions in this game are extremely fun and it is very entertaining to interact with the environment.

76561198041304371,24740,Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box,0.8666666666666667,Racing,0,"Rating: 9/10

Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box is a revolutionary arcade racing game that takes the Burnout series into a free-roaming open world. Released in 2008 by Criterion Games, the game offers fast-paced, destructive racing with an emphasis on stunts and crazy crashes, all set in a vast and dynamic city. The Ultimate Box includes the base game as well as all the downloadable content (DLC) released up until that point, making it the definitive version for those who want to experience the entire game.

What Works Well?
🚗 Open-World Racing
The game’s open-world structure sets it apart from other racing games at the time. Rather than following a linear progression, players can freely drive around the fictional Paradise City, discovering races, challenges, and events. The world is vast, lively, and packed with dynamic content, making it feel alive and exciting.

💥 Destruction and Crashes
Burnout is known for its over-the-top crashes, and Paradise delivers on that in spades. The game has a Crashing system that encourages players to drive recklessly, with spectacular visual effects when you crash into other cars, barriers, or objects. Burnouts are highly satisfying and one of the game’s most memorable features.

🏁 Variety of Race Types and Events
The game offers a wide variety of events that are not limited to traditional races. Players can engage in Road Rage (taking out opponents), Marked Man (escaping pursuers), Stunt Runs, and more. Each event type presents its own challenge, and the more you play, the more you unlock new events, keeping things fresh and exciting.

🎶 Fantastic Soundtrack
The soundtrack of Burnout Paradise is a crowd-pleaser, featuring a varied mix of rock, punk, and electronic music, with tracks that fit perfectly with the high-energy racing. The dynamic soundtrack also changes depending on the events you’re engaged in, further immersing you in the experience.

What Could Be Better?
❌ Controls May Feel Loose to Some
While the game’s arcade-style driving can be thrilling, some players may find the controls a little loose compared to more simulation-based racers. Steering is forgiving, and the game allows you to perform wild drifts, but it may not be as satisfying for players who prefer a more precise racing experience.

❌ No Split-Screen Multiplayer
One major downside for local multiplayer fans is the lack of split-screen racing. While Burnout Paradise offers online multiplayer, the absence of local co-op or versus racing may be a dealbreaker for those who enjoy couch multiplayer.

❌ Aging Graphics
Though the game looked fantastic at launch, the graphics can appear dated when compared to newer racing games. While the art style is still charming, the textures and vehicle models may not impress modern gamers who are accustomed to hyper-realistic visuals.

Conclusion
Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box is a masterpiece of arcade racing that delivers adrenaline-pumping fun and creative destruction. The open-world format, spectacular crashes, and variety of events make it one of the most entertaining racing games of its time. Though it may not have the sharpest visuals or the most precise controls, its fast-paced, chaotic gameplay more than makes up for it. If you love open-world racing or are a fan of the Burnout series, Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box is an absolute must-play.

Rating: 9/10 – A chaotic, fun-filled arcade racer that's still a blast to play today. 🚗💥 | Take me down to the paradise city where the grass green and the girls are pretty!
Very well done, destruction everywhere, and a wonderful arcade racing game | GOAT of arcade racing games, loads of race types and awesome open-world map to explore with different objectives to get.

The fallen angel of the gaming industry.

 | The game also comes with a DLC, which includes the following items:

1. A Toxic Community: Mistakes are rarely forgiven. Unless you’re playing with friends, be prepared to face harsh criticism, often from younger players. The game’s multiplayer is largely populated by school-aged players who don’t hold back.


2. Disruptive Adults: It’s not just the kids causing chaos—some adults blast music through their microphones, assuming everyone else shares their taste. Spoiler: they don’t.


3. Frequent AFKs: Teamwork can fall apart when a teammate goes inactive, whether they’re brewing tea, taking a smoke break, or simply wandering off mid-game. And yes, it often happens right after you’ve generously used your first aid kit on them.


4. Team Abandonment: Lone wolves running off to the far corners of the map, only to be overwhelmed by infected, are a common sight. They’re quick to flood the chat with colorful language before rage-quitting the game.


5. Difficulty Disputes: Some players join games on ""Expert"" difficulty only to demand a downgrade. If their request is denied, they might sabotage the team before leaving the server entirely.


6. Vote Kicks: Occasionally, you’ll encounter players who inexplicably start a vote to kick you from the game. When you ask why? Crickets.



The Verdict: Despite the chaotic community, Left 4 Dead 2 remains a phenomenal experience. The graphics are a significant step up from the first game, the mechanics feel more polished, and there’s a greater variety of weapons and infected to enjoy. However, surviving the online experience without a calming remedy might be just as challenging as surviving the zombie apocalypse itself. | Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D2), released by Valve in 2009, is the gold standard for cooperative zombie shooters. Featuring intense survival gameplay, smart AI, and an incredible atmosphere, L4D2 delivers an unmatched multiplayer experience. With its fast-paced action, diverse weapons, and unpredictable enemy encounters, this game remains one of the most thrilling and replayable co-op shooters ever made.

Gameplay – Pure, Adrenaline-Fueled Action
L4D2 is all about co-op survival. You and three teammates must fight through hordes of the undead, navigating through various maps and completing objectives to reach safety. The key to survival? Teamwork, strategy, and adaptability.

The gunplay is tight and satisfying, with a wide selection of weapons including assault rifles, shotguns, SMGs, sniper rifles, and melee weapons like axes, katanas, and even frying pans! Every encounter feels dynamic, thanks to the AI Director, which adjusts the difficulty based on your team’s performance, ensuring no two playthroughs are ever the same.

Special Infected – Enemies That Keep You on Edge
Beyond the standard zombie horde, L4D2 introduces Special Infected that force players to work together:

Tank – A massive brute that can throw debris and crush survivors.
Witch – A terrifying enemy that, if startled, can instantly incapacitate a survivor.
Smoker – Uses a long tongue to drag players away from their team.
Hunter – A fast, agile infected that pounces on survivors and pins them down.
Boomer – Explodes in a shower of bile, attracting a massive horde.
Charger – Charges through groups, slamming a survivor into the ground.
Spitter – Creates pools of acid that deal heavy damage.
Each Special Infected forces different team strategies, making communication and positioning absolutely crucial.

Campaigns & Maps – A Horror Movie Experience
L4D2 features multiple campaigns, each set in diverse, apocalyptic locations across the southern U.S.:

Dead Center – A chaotic mall escape reminiscent of classic zombie films.
The Parish – A tense race across New Orleans to reach an evacuation zone.
Swamp Fever – A creepy, foggy swamp filled with infected dangers.
Hard Rain – A unique campaign featuring a devastating hurricane that changes the environment.
Dark Carnival – A fan-favorite, featuring a deadly amusement park with a thrilling rollercoaster finale.
Each campaign feels like a mini zombie movie, packed with cinematic set pieces, interactive environments, and intense finales.

Multiplayer & Game Modes – Endless Replayability
L4D2 offers several game modes that keep the action fresh:

Campaign Mode – Classic co-op survival through story-driven levels.
Versus Mode – One team plays as survivors, while the other controls the Special Infected.
Survival Mode – See how long you can last against endless waves of zombies.
Scavenge Mode – A competitive mode where teams race to collect fuel cans while being hunted.
Mutation Mode – Weekly game modifiers that add fun twists to gameplay.
Thanks to modding support and the Steam Workshop, the community has also created hundreds of custom maps, weapons, and campaigns, making L4D2’s replayability practically infinite.

Graphics & Sound – Immersive and Timeless
Even years after release, L4D2’s atmospheric lighting, detailed environments, and gruesome effects hold up well. Zombies react realistically to gunfire, and the sound design is masterful, with eerie background noises, terrifying growls from Special Infected, and intense musical cues that heighten the suspense.

The voice acting and character interactions bring the survivors to life, making them memorable and adding humor to the chaos.

Why Left 4 Dead 2 is a Must-Play
L4D2 is the perfect blend of action, horror, and co-op gameplay. Whether you’re playing with friends or AI teammates, the intense combat, unpredictable enemy encounters, and endless replayability make every match a thrilling adventure.

🔹 Final Rating: 10/10
Left 4 Dead 2 is a masterpiece of cooperative gaming. If you love zombies, action, and teamwork, this is an absolute must-play that still delivers endless fun and excitement after more than a decade.





 | Simplesmente um jogo incrível
Como dizia Jack O Estripador, vamos por partes:
O jogo em sua base já é animal, os mapas foram todos feitos com muito carinho e esmero. 
Todas as campanhas originais são extremamente divertidas de jogar com amigos
As armas são muito legais e os sons são bem interessantes
O jogo é muito variado devido ao ""Diretor"", ele é como se fosse um ser místico que coordena tudo que acontece conforme a partida vai rolando
Nenhuma partida é igual, os especiais vão aparecer em locais diferentes em toda partida e são alternados
A sonorização ambiente é impecável, todas as ações e especiais tem um som distinto. E se o jogo fizer silêncio, você vai poder ouvir tiros e outros sons que indicam que outras pessoas estão por aí
O jogo tem uma variedade muito massa nos mapas, no evento do alarme no shopping em uma partida o jogo vai te levar por um caminho e em outra partida o caminho muda
Não são grandes mudanças no mapa mas ainda deixa a experiência um pouco diferente cada vez que você joga, em uma parte que você passa por um cemitério, o caminho que você faz nesse labirinto de estruturas muda sempre  
E tudo isso é o jogo original, só que tem vários bônus
Todas as campanhas do primeiro jogo estão disponíveis com algumas leves diferenças aqui no segundo jogo (Ainda sim recomendo jogar o 1, a experiência é realmente diferente e mais sombria)
Além disso temos campanhas extra, como por exemplo a ""The Passing"" e a campanha ""The Last Stand""
E a parte mais interessante é Oficina da Steam
Na oficina você pode encontrar mapas feitos pela comunidade, que tem uma qualidade excepcional
Na oficina você também pode encontrar mods para substituir todas as armas do jogo, as que eu mais gosto são as tiradas de jogos de tiro mais focados no realismo, como ""Ready or Not"" ou algum Call of Duty
Com alguns mods gráficos conseguimos dar uma renovada boa no visual do jogo que envelheceu bem, mas ja está meio datado | This game is an excellent choice for players who love co-op chaos and visceral, over-the-top combat. It may not appeal to those seeking deep storytelling, but it delivers pure action-packed fun."

I like Twin Peaks.

The characters are funny.

This is is a fine game. | Interesting story, charming atmosphere, ok puzzles. Great game. | A fusion of Professor Layton, X-Files, and Twin Peaks ran through a Grickle filter.

By the way, don't alt+F4 to quit, the game will freeze. Also, if the game crashes right after the tutorial/prologue, make sure you disable PhysX or w.e in the settings. | It's one of the greatest classic games ever, yet it remains one of the most innovative. Not to mention its sleek and polished design, along with its captivating parkour action and thrilling gameplay, which make it truly one of a kind. | [h2] Pros [/h2]

1. First things first, kudos to the devs for making a non-sexualised female mc back in the day against the norms (even if it was today, we all know a large portion of ""Gamers"" would lose their mind screaming DEI and woke lol). 

2. Secondly, the art direction is superb and it shows that stylistic approach stands the test of time better than realism (look at any REALISTIC graphics game from back then that people lost their shit over, now they just look ugly af). 

3. The parkour is unique, feels great to play on controller, and is easy to learn but hard to master. When you pull off some cool wallrun-turn-jump-walllrun combo, you'd feel like a total badass.

4. The voice actors have done a terrific job giving personality to the characters. I really enjoys Merc's voice guiding me through the levels, and the others were NOT far worse too.

[h2] Cons [/h2]

1. The story is dogshit. It works well enough to connect one parkouring stage to another, but don't go in expecting any story that might emotionally involve you lol.

2. The combat sections feel unnecessary and underdeveloped. Maybe it's just my problem, but I felt like the game would've been better if they scraped the combat totally and added a few more parkouring challenged instead.

[h2] Some points to note [/h2]

1. The game is short. I died a lot of times, stayed afk during game time watching game of thrones (lol) and yet i completed the game under 6 and a 1/2 hours. It might be a deal breaker for some, but I think this was well worth the money.

2. When you play, turn OFF the PhysX, or the game would suffer severe framerate drop everytime a glass shatters (any combat section, really).

[h2] Conclusion [/h2]

Albeit short and emotionally not gripping, Mirror's edge boasts fun and unique gameplay with great visuals to date and a pure good fun time. I recommend this.

[spoiler]从库存堆里掏出来，游戏通关哩，撒花~❀❀❀[/spoiler]
虽然游戏没有中文，但剧情简单粗暴，简直就是现代版的金庸武侠！老大怀疑主角的忠心，让他杀掉自己的爱人以示投名状，闪客不忍不从，于是老大派出手下四大手下来追杀这对主角夫妇。主角闪客死里逃生，但爱人惨死[典中典]。七年之后，深陷犯罪集团阴谋的Shank，将用最残暴的方式踏过地下世界的尸山血海。这场浸透鲜血的复仇之旅，每一帧都迸发着怒火与决绝。

《Shank》是一款致敬经典的横版清关动作游戏，由获奖工作室Klei Entertainment打造。在这部充满邪典电影风格的暴力美学作品中，你将化身主角Shank，在血肉横飞的战场中体验极致的杀戮快感——敌人如潮水般涌来，连击系统酣畅淋漓，头目战设计震撼人心！游戏于2010年10月26日登陆Steam平台，并根据玩家反馈优化了操作手感与平衡性调整。准备好用刀枪开辟血路，开启一场复仇狂欢吧！

[h2]核心特点：[/h2]
[h3]暴力漫画艺术风格[/h3]
由资深导演Jeff Agala操刀，以流畅如动态漫画的分镜与动画，呈现黑帮世界的黑暗美学。画面确实帅炸，但有时候血喷得太多，我都分不清自己在砍人还是砍番茄酱瓶子。
[h3]武器连击系统[/h3]
自由组合刀、枪、链锯等致命武器，创造千变万化的连击招式，让敌人永远猜不到下一击从何而来。
[h3]电影级过场动画[/h3]
通过精美动画片段沉浸式体验Shank的复仇史诗，每一场杀戮都有故事的温度。
[h3]残酷头目对决[/h3]
8场风格迥异的史诗级Boss战，用策略与操作碾压身形数倍于你的疯狂对手。
[h3]本地双人合作模式[/h3]
邀请好友共同血战！在独立于主线的合作剧情中，挑战成群的武装暴徒，揭开单机故事的前传秘辛。

[h2]缺点/不足吐槽：[/h2]
[h3]没有中文[/h3]
虽然剧情简单易懂，但没中文还是有点劝退。尤其是过场动画里的对话细节，Klei工作室，你们是觉得我们中国玩家都自带翻译器吗？
[h3]流程偏短以及老套[/h3]
动画确实好看，但剧情有点老套，典型的“你杀我老婆，我杀你全家”套路。普通模式通关大概2.5小时左右，虽然爽快但意犹未尽。刚进入状态，游戏就结束了，感觉像是吃了一顿快餐，还没吃饱就没了。
[h3]重复性较高[/h3]
砍完第100个小兵后，我已经分不清他们是谁了，反正都是“血包”。敌人种类和场景设计有点单一，后期容易审美疲劳。
[h3]操作门槛[/h3]
连击系统虽然爽，但对新手不太友好，手残党可能会被虐到自闭。特别是我明明按的是“砍人”，为什么角色在“跳舞”？手残党慎入！按错一个键，可能就从“华丽连招”变成“原地发呆”“罚站”。Boss战设计很棒，但某些Boss的难度曲线堪比过山车，前一秒还在虐菜，下一秒强度就上来了。

[hr][/hr]
总结：
《Shank》是一款充满暴力美学的横版动作游戏，适合喜欢爽快战斗和复仇剧情的玩家。虽然有些小缺点，但整体体验依然值得一试。如果你是动作游戏爱好者，或者只是想找个发泄压力的方式，那么《Shank》绝对能满足你！

推荐人群：动作游戏爱好者、暴力美学爱好者、手速达人、有朋友的幸运儿。

[i]С чего же бы начать... Ах да, Сонику с большим трудом дался переход в полноценное 3D. После оригинальной трилогии разработчики задумывались о новой части, но при это спешили приступать к разработке. При этом в самой SEGA и между её американским и японским подразделениях творился полный бардак, приведший в итоге к отмене Sonic X-Treme для Saturn, а продажи ответвлений не внушали особо оптимизма. Однако не смотря на это ребята из Sonic Team преступили к работе, к тому же руководство выделило на разработку 10 млн. долларов, что для видеоигры тех лет было внушительно. В итоге спустя 3 года разработки, которые старались держать в тайне, 22 августа 1998 состоялся анонс игры, а релиз состоялся уже в конце года в Японии и через год осенью 1999-го, во время релиза консоли Dreamcast в остальном мире. По итогу игра успешно продалась, став одной из лучших частей во франшизе о синем еже. Не мудрено ибо игра частично отошла от привычной для серии формулы сохранив основные черты, но в тоже время привнесла много новых элементов повлиявшие на дальнейшие игры серии на годы вперед.

Однако не всё так гладко, как хотелось. Мне игра понравилась, но на некоторые её косяки закрывать глаза я не собираюсь. У игры есть достоинства и нововведения, но при этом много мелочных косяков из-за которых мне пришлось с большим трудом. К тому же стимовский ПК-порт просто никакущий, что приходится ставить моды на исправления и графику с Dreamcast-версии, дабы графическая пустота Director's Cut-версии не мазолила глаза. В общем есть о чем мне рассказать и пояснить за первое трехмерное приключение синего ежа.[/i]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DwGK49VXVg&t=2s
[h1]Небольшие изменения в геймплее и новые элементы[/h1]
Игровой процес в первом Adventure пожалуй был на момент выхода самым не типичным для серии. Если в классических частях игровой процесс представлял из себя платформер с применением ускорения, который поощрял иследование уровней и имел несколько путей для дальнейшего продвижения. То здесь игровой процесс сделал упор в улучшение имевшихся механик и адаптацией в полноценное 3D, а также введя впервые для серии полуоткрытый мир, поделенный на несколько локаций иминуемый в игре ""Полями приключения"" (Adventure field), чье появление будет не частым в серии, но будет сделано хорошо (или относительно) в Sonic Unleashed и Sonic Frontiers. Однако первая трехмерная игра о синем еже не была столь значимой без своих особенностей:
[list]
 [*]Несколько играбельных персонажей со своими особенностями, а так же кампаниями пересикающимися по ходу продвижения сюжета. У каждого из героев есть свои особенности и разные версии уровней. Так у Соника классический скоростной платформер, у Наклза поиск осколков Мастер Изумруда, а у Тейлза гонки на время в который приходится обгонять Соника. Эми может использовать свой молот против супостатов, но на её уровнях основной задачей является сбежать от очередного робота Эггмана.

 [*]Не типичными получились кампании за робота E-102 ""Гамма"" и кота Бига. Первый представляет из себя неплохо сделанный run'n'gun, в умелых руках превращающий рядового робота в машину по истреблению бадников. Второй по идее должен разбовлять динамичный геймплей в своей сюжетке за счём механики с рыбалкой. Только проблема в другом - рыбалка за Бига пожалуй самая несбалансированная и плохо сделанная часть игры. Я всё понимаю добавить челленджа в рыболовлю, чтобы игрок смотрел индикатором дабы не порвалась леска и старался дожидать лучшего момента дабы подтянуть рыбу не плохо. Одноко поймать рыбу одно, самое главно достать и тут всё зависит от рандома. 

 [*]Сад Чао. Тут уже я мало что могу сказать. С одной стороны видно, что разработчики посматривали в сторону Tamagotchi и использовали свои наработки из Nights into DREAMS. Но по мне вышло двояко. Вроде и интересно наблюдать, за тем как ты взращиваешь конкретного или двоих малышей для участия в гонках, а с другой гриндить животных для прокачки не охота.
[/list]
Что касается дизайна уровней, то тут без негативных сторон. Выполненые они отлично, платформинг радует, а некоторые этапы дадут хорошенько попотеть. Но минусом по мне выступает не самое сбалансированое управление, которое переодически вызывает гнев когда пытаешься пройти уровень без урона. К тому же в DX-версии добавили ""Режим Миссий"" в колличестве 60 штук. И знаете, без гайдов их вряд ли можно пройти ибо не порой трудно понять, что от тебя хотят. Ну и некоторые из них просто выполняются через рандом, что тоже выбешивает. Боссы тоже местами то дают стимул заучивать их действия, то тупо выступают как бойцовская груша для хоуминг-атак. Как-то так.

[h1]Древнее божество, чей гнев пробудился из-за алчности одного ученого[/h1]
Здешний сюжет с одной стороны не перестал строится по отработанной формуле. Соник с друзьями всё так же пытается остановить доктора Эггмана от его очередной попытки захватить мир. Однако к знакомому примесу сценаристы добавляют третью сторону в лице Хаоса, водяного существа некогда охрянявшего Мастер Изумруд и о чем существовании знали лишь единицы из предков ехидны Наклза. Но один инцендент в итоге, пробудил его гнев, который он выплеснул уничтожив практически весь клан из-за он был запечатан в Изумруде на долгие годы, до тех пока Эггман не узнал о его существовании и не решил использовать ради своих целей. Что радует, так это как сценаристы через каждую из линий и промелькающие флэшбеки нам рассказывают о его прошлом, попутно рассказывая о том с чем сталкиваются действующие лица. Да даже история Бига с его попытками вернуть своего друга не кажется чем-то лишним. Ну и под финал разыграли эпик, который перечеркивает все недостатки повествования. 

[h1]Неровный визуал с яркими хард-роковыми мотивами[/h1]
Говоря об визуальной и графической составляющей, мне немного тяжело назвать её хорошей. Если брать оригинальную Dreamcast-версию то графика для стартового проекта на новой консоле выглядело хорошо. Даже не смотря на кривую лицевую анимацию у основных персонажей визуал был целостным. Чего не скажешь об DX-версии, где вместо нормального обновления графики они лишь основным моделькам добавили полигонов, но на остальные аспекты положили здоровенный болт.  Благо всё это правится благодаря модам. 

Звуковая сторона в купе с музыкально получились отличными. Тут без притензий. Озвучание персонажей тоже получилось на уровне. Конечно, диалоги местами звучать очень топорно и актёры порой звучали не в попад, но видно что старались. Да и голоса Соника и Эггмана чего стоят, даже не смотря на то, что мне привычнее слышать их более современные итерации. Музыка пожалуй одна из лучших сторон игры. Композитор Дзюн Сэнуоэ, который пришел в серию начиная с оригинальной третьей части сохранил мелодичный настрой кочевавший из части в часть и совместно с другими создал запоминающийся саундтрек, где каждая композиция олицетворяет конкретную местность и персонажа. А про заглавную тему Open Your Heart c вокалом Джонни Джиоэли можно долго говорить, но то что она делает правильно - это захватывает дух слушателя, не отпуская до последней строчки текста.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OODWnfNK9CU
[h1]Итоговый результат[/h1]
Подводя итоги мне трудно сказать прошла ли игра проверку временем или нет. У неё есть опредиленные недостатки, которые сами разработчики создали последующими ре-релизами, а с другой антураж залихватского приключения с яркими персонажами и неплохой историей не дают мне окончательно забыть об игре. Единственной правильной вещью я считаю было сделать полноценный римейк Adventure для современной аудитории с исправлением косяков оригинала. Что же до влияния на серию, то это был первый шаг в совершенно новую эпоху для синего ежа и пускай Dreamcast, как игровую платформу успех игры не особо спас, но тем не менее дал Sonic Team время для сиквела, который взял всё лучшее возведя приключения Соника на новый уровень. Но о ней в другой раз.

76561198041304371,620,Portal 2,11.233333333333333,"Action, Adventure",19,"Portal 2 is one of the best puzzle games ever created. It combines logical thinking, physics-based mechanics, and an engaging story. The game takes place in Aperture Science, a mysterious and dangerous laboratory filled with test chambers. The player controls Chell, a silent protagonist who must escape using the Portal Gun. This device allows players to create two linked portals on surfaces, making it possible to teleport and solve puzzles.

One of the most impressive aspects of Portal 2 is its level design. Each test chamber introduces new mechanics, forcing players to think creatively. The game starts with simple puzzles but gradually becomes more complex. Elements like light bridges, propulsion gel, and lasers add depth to the challenges. The difficulty curve is perfect, making the game enjoyable for both beginners and experienced players.

Portal 2 also stands out with its story and humor. The main antagonist, GLaDOS, is a sarcastic and witty AI who constantly insults and manipulates the player. Wheatley, a clumsy and funny robot, adds another layer of comedy. Their dialogues make the game more entertaining and memorable. Despite its humor, the story also explores themes of control, identity, and artificial intelligence.

Another great feature of Portal 2 is its cooperative mode. Unlike the single-player campaign, co-op requires teamwork and communication. Players control two robots, Atlas and P-Body, solving puzzles that require coordination. This mode enhances the experience, making it even more enjoyable when played with a friend.

Overall, Portal

差不多7年前，我的小学同学就发现了这款大作，那时手机版还没有心动，只有应用商店里的1.2版本，对于当时的我们，手机版1.2只有两个滑轮键控制移动和瞄准，并且局域网联机方便，十分益于上手。我和几个哥们一放假就聚在一起play。当时我们卡在世纪之花这个boss，就聚在学校小花园商量战术，没想到我自己直接单挑过了，还有我第一次打过肉山，是拿蜜蜂手雷和它同归于尽，真的很怀念1.2陪伴我的时光，之后1.2下架，国服代理，为了玩上1.3的泰拉，我在好游快爆苦苦地种玉米（当时可以以此换取游玩资格，否则就要花钱），没想到最后发现还需要早起抢购资格，而我当时可能在上学，没有抢到，努力直接白费。我和同学只能在网上寻找那些还没下架1.2的网站继续玩。
从小学到了初中，以前玩泰拉的朋友各奔东西，但我对泰拉的热情依然不减，后来出了手游国际版我便立即下载，顶着看不懂的英文，摸索1.3的机制，专家模式掉落的装备我都从未见过，新鲜感和好奇心油然而生，初中期间我也找到了一两个一起玩的，使我不至于太孤独。疫情之前，我从来都是只玩手机版泰拉，知道疫情上网课，我终于有机会玩上电脑版了。当时的我对电脑并不精通，也不知道steam是什么东西，于是就在360浏览器直接搜泰拉瑞亚，经过一天的寻找，我也是下到了盗版泰拉（当时我也不知道正版要买）就这么在电脑上再通关了一遍普通模式，但这次没有任何人陪伴，只有我一个人。
终于到了高中，我了解了正规的steam渠道，在打折期间花18块钱买了正版泰拉，为童年补了票，高二认识了几个志同道合的同学，一起玩了灾厄，也是乐在其中。如今，我即将成人，步入大学生活，但我的泰拉之旅还在继续，玩了十几年游戏，只有泰拉瑞亚给我的印象最深，给我带来的乐趣最多，对于陪伴了我78年的老伙计，打多少星已经不重要了，真没想到我能写这么多，回顾了一遍我的童年，我的眼里有些模糊。 | --{ Gráficos }---

Great bosses, fun stat progression, sandbox building, etc. Highly recommend. | Очень классная игра. Давно играю в него спустя с мобильной версии террарии.

Люблю эту игру | The game is fabulous, but a bit more handholding at the very beginning would be nice, because the moment the game started, I had no idea what I was supposed to do or how I was supposed to build anything or use my inventory, so the first few minutes were horrendous, and I was dying quite a lot, which reminded me why I instantly deleted this game many years ago when trying to play it for the very first time. This time around I decided to keep at it, and the first 10–15 hours were slow, but then I got the hang of it, and the game consumed me to the point where I lost track of time and racked up 100 hours just completing the main story and hunting for some achievements. Be prepared to keep your browser running in the background, because you are probably going be switching between the game and the Terraria Wiki quite a lot."
76561198041304371,46510,Syberia II,0.0,Adventure,0,"ilk oyunun devamı niteliğinde bulmaca çözmeli point click hikaye oyunu , daha uzun senaryo daha çok diyalog kamera açısı gene aynı ilk oyunnla aynı sevemedim bu olayı genel olarak fena değil eski ama güzel oyun | В целом, продолжение слабее первой части, но всё ещё достойно. 
И да - это именно прямое продолжение. Вернее даже - завершение. 
Она прямо продолжает и завершает оборванный в первой части сюжет, а также строится на всё тех же механиках. 
В чём же она тогда уступает первой части - в общей продуманности. 
Почти всю игру меня преследовало ощущение, что игра сделана как по инерции после первой. Скорее всего, у автора изначально было общее видение всей истории, и он отдал много сил на её отображение раньше. А здесь уже или выдохся/выгорел, или не хватило времени на увязку и проработку деталей. В итоге и загадки и общая атмосфера стали менее логичными, чем были в первой части. Появляется всё больше авторских допущений и условностей, теряется стройность. Но в то же время сюжетно виден единый стержень истории - вот он проработан не хуже. 
Поэтому и ощущения смешанные. 
С одной стороны - это нарративно достойное завершение сюжета со всеми полагающимися эмоциями и накалом. 
А с другой стороны - чем ближе к концу, тем больше плывёт логика загадок. Пример без спойлеров: в одном эпизоде нужно осмотреть определённое место и взять оттуда некий предмет. Этот предмет пригодится Кейт очень нескоро, совсем в другой ситуации, которую она ну никак не может предсказать заранее. А сам по себе этот предмет не представляет никакой ценности. Ни эстетической, ни практической. Он бесполезен. Но нам обязательно надо его взять. Зачем? Для чего? Почему именоо его? Не логичное. 
И вот чем ближе к концу игры, тем больше таких условностей и нелогичностей начинает проявляться, хотя конкретно финальная загадка выполнена без нареканий - над ней явно успели поработать, в отличие от нескольких до неё. 

Вывод: начинать приобщаться к Сибири с этой части не стоит - она прямо подхватывает прошлую. 
Но если вы прошли первую и хотите знать, а чем там всё закончится - пройдите и эту, весь процесс вам будет уже знаком, вкатываться не придётся. Отдельные огрехи в логике можно простить ради целостности истории и по совокупности обеих частей.

Дополнительно отмечу, что конкретно эта версия в Стиме подаётся почему-то без ру-локализации, но в обсуждениях сообщества здесь же есть темы, по которым это лечится. Там несколько способов, не все оказались рабочими. К сожалению, уже не помню, какой именно сработал, но что-то точно было. Так что точно лечится и проходится до конца - проверено. 
 | Как и первая часть прекрасна, а головоломки тяжелее, а сюжет еще интереснее, советую, также советую почитать обзор мой об 1 части игры, чтобы понять всю суть обзора! Всем добра :) | слабее первой части, персонажи не раскрыты, локации так себе (разве что монастырь действительно красив), происходящие события уже просто [spoiler] бред [/spoiler] фантастика. Наша гг делает все возможное, чтобы бедный умирающий старичок добрался таки до своих мамонтов и осуществил свою детскую мечту. Зачем это нужно самой Кейт и как она собирается вернутся обратно живой остается загадкой. 
В плане сюжета (а ради чего еще играть в квесты) эта часть полный провал, очень скучно и просто абсурдно. Первая часть закончилась идеально, лучше бы история закончилась на ней

Как Кейт общается с русскими, если не знает их языка? думайте | Très bonne suite du premier jeu. L'histoire reprend bien à la fin du premier et reste bon à suivre, les décores reste très beau à voir, tandis que la musique est toujours agréable à écouter."

제목대로 포탈을 타면서 여러 퍼즐들을 해치우면 되는 그런 게임이다.

출시된지 오래된 게임이지만, 완성도가 굉장히 높은 게임이고 이를 증명하듯 현재에도 많은 유저들이 플레이하고 있는 갓겜.

3D멀미가 있는 사람들에게는 조금 힘들 수 있고 몇몇 퍼즐은 피지컬적인 요소가 꽤 들어가 있지만, 퍼즐의 완성도는 정말 높은 게임.

참고) 오래된 게임인만큼 커뮤니티나 인터넷에 공략들도 많이 돌아다니고 있으니 진행하다가 혹은 도전과제  진행시 막히면 참고도 가능하다. | Minha análise sincera de Portal.

Queria eu fazer uma análise sincera sobre esse jogo, mas não há necessidade, esse jogo dispensa qualquer elogio, um jogo a frente de seu tempo, criativo, divertido, com uma das melhores vilãs que já vi, isso só ouvindo sua voz.

Still Alive, esse jogo é GOAT e sempre será. | Fun game, burns a lot of time. Its really fun, and has great puzzles. this is an example of what games should be like. this game is magnificant, if there was a horror game like this i would be in love frr. This game is amazing

10/10!!! | jogar portal é igual chupar priquito, você não sabe oq tá fazendo, mas se sente muito bem depois de chegar onde quer. 😂 | Que jogão! Mais um clássico lindo e perfeito da Valve junto com Half-Life, Left 4 Dead e Team Fortress!"

It's a very challenging game, even frustrating at times, as it can feel almost impossible (some of the final bosses are really tough, and you really need to memorize their attack patterns), but it's a really great game if you take your time to learn it. The art-style is grotesque, and the atmosphere is oppressing, but these things combined work well with the somewhat bleak world and characters. Given the game's roguelike nature, RNG can sometimes fuck you big time, and some runs kind of feel doomed from the start; other times you get fucked towards the end, but there's always something new to find or to unlock, so no run feels completely wasted. My only real complaint with this version is that at times the performance is kinda shit as the game lags/feels unresponsive at times (maybe because it was made in Flash, not really sure), and you can die due to stuff out of your control.

Still, The Binding of Isaac's a classic and really worth the price. | playing this game on the school computers on a browser was so fun, would recommend if you like the classic NES Zelda game | 8/10 O jogo é muito bom, leve e divertido para passar o tempo. A única razão pela qual não posso dar uma nota de 10 é porque a platina é incrivelmente difícil.

No final, só resta a pergunta: quem está realmente preso aqui, Isaac ou você? | Best action rougelike bullet hell game! I'd say it's worth to try once in your lifetime.

DD Awakened is dead and no longer updated. DD2 was okay. DD1 has aged like fine wine. The graphics are stylish to the point they really dont show much age, not like other games of this era do. Would recomend. | pretty interesting game. kinda hit the point where endgame gets stale and u do the same thing but grinding for very miniscule upgrades. 

tower stacking makes it a lot less interesting but kinda required with how grindy it is. wish there was an option for no trading but increased rates. 

information should be more public with droprates/item quality. having to dig through discords to figure out how certain game mechanics work, or how some areas are just terrible to farm feels really bad. 

most of my time is afk doing survival waves. 

worth trying if you really like tower defence games and are looking for something different. buy everything on sale tho. 

 | Over all, a absolutely amazing game, the big issue I have is recently there was a 48 hour downtime for ranked (The only way to safely play multiplayer, and obtain achievments), which is what it is. But they took away access to the ranked saves which people had poured hours into, normally this isn't a bad thing as downtime will end. But as it has now ended, ranked specifically for redux no longer functions while standard ranked does. We have 0 comment on wether this is intentional or if something broke. But me and many others could have just lost hoursss of time without warning or chance to export saves. And any mention of this is ignored. | Timeless classic, self contained and fun tower defense RPG.

76561198041304371,102600,Orcs Must Die!,8.566666666666666,"Action, Indie, Strategy",8,"Интересный представитель жанра, но для первого знакомства не рекомендую.
Контента не очень много, если сравнивать со среднестатистическими конкурентами, вроде ""Plants vs. Zombies"", ""Defender's Quest"" и даже ""Space Run"". И я сравниваю именно с играми в жанре башенной защиты, хотя это не точное сравнение, ведь ""Orcs Must Die!"" скорее боевик от третьего лица.
Оценивать игру в сравнении с другими похожими не хочется, потому что они будут иметь, очевидно, похожие недостатки. А оценивать в вакууме, в отрыве ото всех игр вообще - тоже, потому что персонаж там уже изолирован на небольших аренах, как в серии Painkiller.
Баги портят общее впечатление - от проваливающихся в текстуры врагов до люстр, замирающих при падении в баррикадах. Был даже баг, когда началась новая волна, хотя у прежней всё ещё был живой и здравствующий гоблин-шаман.
Поиск пути у врагов периодами выдаёт финты и заставляет застревать в самых неожиданных местах.
Баланс тоже далёк от творческой свободы - при кажущемся обилии ловушек, оружия, стражей и улучшений, у них не так много гибкости при размещении, и синергии между всем этим обилием очень мало.

Основной шарм в юморе и динамике, в постоянном давлении со стороны противника, а также в относительной свежести подхода на период выхода игры. Однако основная идея всех игр жанра Tower Defense в том, что игрок доминирует над положением и выстраивает большей частью автономную защиту, тогда как эта игра ближе к боевику, учитывая количество урона, которое должен наносить сам главный персонаж, бегая по арене, и возможностей выстроить автономную защиту здесь нет. Если же сравнивать игру с другими боевиками, то эта постоянная изоляция делает её очень скудной и однообразной.
Ярым поклонникам жанра, конечно же, лучше ознакомиться; тем более, если на всю серию уже регулярны высокие скидки от 80% и более. | Como la mayoría, habrán jugado este juego en versión pirata sin completar el juego. Ahora que lo tengo acá y lo completé, pues si valió la pena. (Consejo: mejora si o si a los guardianes, me lo agradeceras). | Es entretenido, aunque se le notan mucho los años y que fue la base para esta saga. El 2 es bastante mejor a pesar de no tener mucha diferencia entre entregas, y además tiene cooperativo (cosa que el primero no tiene) así que recomendaría jugar a este solo si tienes curiosidad por como fue el primero. | 童年经典塔防游戏了，自己是从二代跟基友联机开始入坑的，现在正版补票，只可惜这代只能单人游玩。 | I'm not super great at this game, and though I wanted to play more of it I just didn't have the time it takes to put into it.

Overview: ORION: Prelude is a first-person shooter and survival game developed by Spiral Game Studios. Set in a sci-fi universe, the game offers players the chance to fight off waves of enemies, mine for resources, and explore alien landscapes. As the ""Prelude"" in the title suggests, this is part of a larger series that focuses on cooperative survival and exploration. Players can engage in solo or multiplayer modes, with the game offering various environments and enemies to battle.

Gameplay: At its core, ORION: Prelude is a mix of survival, exploration, and action. The game features dynamic combat, where players fight off hordes of enemies with a variety of weapons and tools. Players can also mine resources to improve their weapons, build turrets, and upgrade their defenses.

The game supports both solo and multiplayer modes, with the co-op experience being a major highlight. In multiplayer, players can team up to face increasingly difficult waves of enemies. This cooperative play adds a layer of strategy, as players need to work together to survive the onslaught.

The combat itself is relatively standard for a first-person shooter, with a variety of weapons available, including guns, explosives, and melee tools. However, the AI can sometimes feel lackluster, and the enemy design doesn’t offer much variety or challenge in the long run.

Graphics and Performance: ORION: Prelude features fairly basic graphics for a modern first-person shooter. The environments are passable but not particularly impressive, with alien landscapes that can feel repetitive. The textures and character models are simple, and while they’re functional, they don't stand out visually. The game’s visual style is somewhat dated, even by the standards of games released around its time.

In terms of performance, ORION: Prelude runs decently on most systems, but it can struggle with optimization at times. Some players report frame rate drops or occasional stuttering, especially in more intense combat scenarios or when there are many enemies on screen. While the game isn't demanding on hardware, the performance can still be inconsistent, which may detract from the experience.

Audio Design: The audio in ORION: Prelude is serviceable but not remarkable. The sound effects for weapons, explosions, and enemies are decent but don’t have a strong impact. The soundtrack is fairly generic, with ambient sci-fi tunes that don’t add much to the atmosphere. While the audio isn't distracting, it doesn’t elevate the experience either. There’s no significant voice acting, which could have added personality and immersion to the game’s characters and story.

Challenges: ORION: Prelude offers a moderate challenge, especially in survival mode. As players progress through waves of enemies, the difficulty increases, requiring players to manage resources, defend positions, and upgrade their gear. However, the lack of diverse enemy types or complex AI behavior can make the game feel repetitive over time.

The game can become quite grindy, as players need to farm resources, mine, and continuously upgrade their weapons and defenses. While this can be fun for a while, it may begin to feel monotonous, especially if playing solo.

Final Thoughts: ORION: Prelude is an ambitious, yet somewhat flawed, survival shooter. While the cooperative gameplay and resource management offer some fun, the overall experience can feel repetitive and lacks the depth needed to keep players fully engaged. The game’s dated graphics, lack of enemy variety, and inconsistent performance hold it back from being a standout title in the genre.

Pros:

Fun cooperative multiplayer with friends
Resource management and upgrading add strategic elements
Some decent combat mechanics
Fairly easy to jump into for casual play
Cons:

Dated graphics and repetitive environments
Weak AI and lackluster enemy variety
Performance issues, including frame drops and stuttering
Lack of story or deep character development
Can become grindy and repetitive over time
ORION: Prelude offers a decent co-op survival experience but struggles to stand out in the crowded first-person shooter market. It’s enjoyable for short sessions with friends, but the lack of long-term depth and technical issues may prevent it from becoming a lasting favorite. | SOLID Game to play with friends you really cant beat 99 cents I love it! | Worth every penny.

76561198041304371,108800,Crysis 2 - Maximum Edition,0.36666666666666664,Action,0,"Crysis 2 – одна из тех игр, которые оставляют после себя яркие впечатления. Это не просто шутер, а настоящий технологический прорыв своего времени. Первое, что бросается в глаза – потрясающая графика. Даже спустя годы после выхода игра выглядит великолепно, благодаря проработанному освещению, детализированным текстурам и впечатляющей разрушаемости окружающего мира.

Геймплейно Crysis 2 предлагает отличное сочетание динамичных перестрелок и тактического подхода. Нанокостюм – главный козырь игры, дающий возможность адаптироваться к любой ситуации: можно стать невидимым и тихо обходить врагов, а можно включить броню и идти напролом. Благодаря этому каждый бой становится уникальным.

Сюжет, пусть и не самый новаторский, держит в напряжении, а атмосферный Нью-Йорк, охваченный войной, погружает в происходящее с головой. Саундтрек от Ханса Циммера – отдельная причина поиграть, потому что музыка здесь действительно усиливает эффект эпичности.

В целом, Crysis 2 – это игра, которая заслуживает внимания не только за счет графики, но и благодаря увлекательному геймплею и крутой атмосфере. Даже сейчас она отлично играется и приносит массу удовольствия. | Crysis 2 set out to take everything that made its predecessor a technical marvel and refine it into a more accessible, fast-paced shooter. 
And while it certainly delivers some thrilling moments and impressive visuals, it doesn’t quite recapture the open-world jungle stealth that made the first game so iconic.
The change in setting from the jungle to an urban environment is a bold shift, but it introduces a more linear structure that feels somewhat restrictive, especially for those who loved the sandbox-style freedom of the first game. 
New York itself is a beautifully detailed war zone, but it’s a far cry from the lush, expansive jungles of Crysis.
One of the standout features of Crysis 2 is, unsurprisingly, its visual fidelity. 
The game is absolutely stunning, with some of the best lighting and detailed textures of its time. 
The city’s towering skyscrapers and desolate streets look phenomenal, with dynamic weather and destruction adding to the immersion. 
If you’re playing it on a capable machine, it’s easy to get lost in the beauty of it all.
The Nanosuit still provides a range of abilities, but this time, combat is much more action-focused. 
The addition of a more streamlined experience, including quicker movements, tight corridors, and intense firefights, turns Crysis 2 into a more traditional first-person shooter. 
While the cloak and armor abilities are still enjoyable, the focus on tighter levels and less open-ended gameplay doesn’t give you the same sense of power or freedom as the first game did. 
The game feels more like a ""shoot 'em up"" than the strategic, stealth-based experience that Crysis offered.
Combat itself is solid, with well-designed weapons and enemy AI that offers a decent challenge. 
The alien enemies, while interesting and varied, don’t evoke the same awe as the ones in the first game, and their repetitive design often makes encounters feel formulaic. 
The inclusion of human enemies, however, brings a decent level of variety to the action.
Unfortunately, the narrative doesn’t do much to elevate the experience. 
The plot feels like a typical alien invasion story, and the characters, including Alcatraz, are flat and lack the emotional depth that would have made the stakes feel more meaningful.
All in all, Crysis 2 is a game with plenty of technical polish and high-octane action, but it falls short of recapturing the magic of the original. 
The switch to a more linear structure, coupled with a less captivating story, makes it feel more like a solid shooter than the genre-defining experience the first game was.
If you're in it for the action and beautiful visuals, Crysis 2 delivers. 
But if you were hoping for the same kind of immersive, open-world stealth and freedom that made the original such a standout, you may find yourself a bit disappointed.
A visually stunning, action-packed shooter that doesn't quite live up to its predecessor's legacy. | + Intense combat, aliens are convincing, the theme of continuing to pursue mission at all costs
suit mechanics intriguing 
- poor AI, some dullness in environments, a little cliched? 
overall a very good experience | With Crysis being Crysis, the game looks fantastic. Only strange graphical thing I saw was the reload animations but for a 2011 game it looks amazing. Pretty alright story, good level design, good gun play, a lot of agency given to players to figure out their own way of tackling a situation. Good game, especially worth a pick up if on sale.

I definitely recommend this game!

 | Orcs Must Die! 2 – це продовження першої частини, яке додає ще більше битв з орками та динамічного геймплею. Найбільша перевага – можливість грати вдвох, разом планувати розташування пасток і захищати замок від хвиль ворогів. Також стало більше варіантів покращення пасток, що дозволяє експериментувати та створювати власні стратегії.

Проте є й недоліки. Графіка здається гіршою, ніж у першій частині – менш чітка, з дещо розмитими текстурами. Рухи персонажів і керування теж поступаються оригіналу, але це не заважає насолоджуватися грою, особливо в кооперативному режимі. Шкода, що немає української мови, хоча англійський текст і озвучка досить вдалі та додають грі атмосфери.

Загалом Orcs Must Die! 2 – чудове продовження з цікавими покращеннями, більшими рівнями та динамічним ігровим процесом. Незважаючи на деякі недоліки, гра захоплює й добре підійде тим, хто любить поєднання стратегії та екшену. (А ще вбивати орків.) | noice shooter / tower defense hybrid I know. It's fun, it's flashy, it's cool looking, you're cool, everything's cool.
Map design, sound effects, music, voices, art style, graphics, it's all done very well and combines into a game that's just.. a lot of fun to play.

You have an array of cool weapons to unlock, and ditto traps. You're also totally free to choose a playstyle. If you don't want to rely heavily on traps, you can go with projectile or melee weapons, or you can go full no-touch mastermind and use only traps and maneuvering, this is left up to you in the most organic way possible - you just pick the equipment you prefeer at the start of the round and that's it.

Yes, the graphics are not that good - I mean, just pixel art part is okay, but text was low quality, also some backgrounds. It also completely lacks options - like change window size or music volume.

But despite it all - it's a beautiful story. I enjoyed it a lot - it has funny jokes and moments, and wholesome, heartwarming parts, and very sad ones... Definitely worth playing, maybe buy on sale - full price is a bit much for amount of content.

Free Minisodes are okay, they add a bit of lore which is not needed to understand and don't add anything to main game, but if you plan on playing other games with those characters they could add some depth (I am not sure, as I didn't play them yet) | Bazı oyunlar vardır ki teknolojik gücüyle ya da görsel ihtişamıyla değil, hikâyesiyle insanı içine çeker. ""To The Moon"" benim için tam da böyle bir oyun. İlk oynadığım andan itibaren beni derinden etkileyen, kalbimin en derin köşelerine dokunan bir deneyim yaşattı.

Grafikleri ilk bakışta pek etkileyici gelmeyebilir; pikselli, eski tarz bir görsellik sunuyor. Ama işte tam burada oyunun büyüsü devreye giriyor. Grafiklerin sadeliği, hikâyenin derinliğiyle öylesine güzel bir şekilde harmanlanmış ki, bir süre sonra o görsel sadelik oyunun sıcak atmosferine katkı sağlayan bir unsur hâline geliyor. Zaten ""To The Moon"" grafikle değil, hikâyeyle var olan bir oyun.

Hikâyesine gelecek olursak, baştan sona duygusal bir yolculuk. İki bilim insanı, Sigmund Corporation’dan Dr. Rosalene ve Dr. Watts, yaşlı bir adam olan Johnny’nin son arzusunu gerçekleştirmek için onun anılarına yolculuk yapıyor. Johnny’nin dileği, Ay’a gitmek. Ama neden Ay’a gitmek istediğini bilmiyor. İşte bu sorunun cevabını bulmak ve bu dileği yerine getirmek için geçmişe gidiyoruz. Her bir anı parçası, Johnny’nin hayatına dair yeni bir katman açığa çıkarıyor ve oyuncuya çok güçlü duygular yaşatıyor.

Diyaloglar ise oyunun en güçlü yanlarından biri. Samimi, sıcak ve yer yer mizahi. Özellikle Dr. Watts’ın esprileri ile Dr. Rosalene’in ciddi tavırları arasındaki uyum o kadar güzel işlenmiş ki, bu ikiliyle daha fazla zaman geçirmek istiyorsunuz. Ancak asıl vurucu nokta, Johnny ve eşi River arasındaki ilişki. İkisinin hikâyesi, acısıyla tatlısıyla öyle derin ve gerçekçi ki, bazen size oyunu durdurup kendi hayatınızı ve ilişkilerinizi düşündürdüğü anlar oluyor. River’ın sessiz ama anlam dolu duruşu, Johnny’nin onunla olan bağını daha da anlamlı kılıyor.

Müziklerine gelecek olursak, Kan Gao’nun bestelediği o melodiler hikâyeyi daha da unutulmaz kılıyor. Müzikler, hikâyenin duygusal yoğunluğunu tamamlayan bir sanat eseri gibi.

""To The Moon"", benim için sadece bir oyun değil, bir sanat eseri. Anılar, pişmanlıklar, sevgi ve hayaller üzerine bir meditasyon gibi. Oynarken bir yandan hüzünleniyor, bir yandan da insana dair pek çok şey öğreniyorsunuz. Eğer hâlâ oynamadıysanız, bu unutulmaz yolculuğu bir an önce yaşamanızı öneririm.

-A melhor história da franquia
-Introdução do Shadow

É com eles que o jogo mais bugou comigo, seja pela física ou por bugs, o homing attack desgraçado que hora ou outra ataca algo que eu ou não estou mirando ou algo que nem sequer está na tela, morri demais por causa disso, fora o spin-dash que na maioria das vezes pode acabar jogando o personagem pra fora da tela se for uma fase no ar.

A gameplay do Tails e Eggman são absurdamente sem sal pra mim, é só andar, pular e esmagar o botão do tiro, que traz com ele um barulho insuportável da mira deles, não seria tão chato jogar essas fases se elas não tivessem em uma quantidade tão grande no jogo.

A gameplay do Knuckles e Rouge poderia ser um ponto positivo se não tivessem estragado os radares de esmeraldas aqui.
Ele SEMPRE vai apitar na ordem que o jogo deseja, você pode passar do lado de uma que o jogo não vai apitar, somente a que ele colocou primeiro na fileira, isso deixa as fases desses dois absurdamente demorada e tem fases que são tão gigantes que você pode ficar até perdido, oque é uma pena, pois jogar com os dois no mundo aberto é bacana, triste mesmo é ter que procurar esmeraldas com um radar idiota desse.

Muitas lutas de Bosses eu não consigo gostar, toda vez que tem luta de Sonic vs Shadow é um Spam de homing attack que deixa a luta muito bagunçada, uma coisa que também ODEIO no jogo é a maldita câmera que vive pregando peças durante o jogo e na luta final do Sonic e Shadow ela vira bruscamente algumas vezes e me fez morrer.

As cutscenes também me incomodam a falta de sincronia das vozes com os modelos, fora alguns dubladores que não conseguem passar tanta emoção, mas destaque positivo para as vozes do Sonic, Amy, Shadow, Rouge e talvez Eggman pela cutscene épica do Anúncio.

Quase me esqueci de falar do Chao Garden mas eu não ligo muito, talvez seja mais um ponto positivo pro jogo por ser algo diferente.

Em geral não chega a ser um jogo ruim, mas pra mim é salvo pela ótima história e trilha sonora, porque me divertir mesmo foi raro, a experiência que tive na reta final do jogo foi tenebrosa e isso pra mim pesou para não recomendar o jogo.
Envelheceu mal pra caramba e eu não queria pedir um remake na era dos remakes que ninguém suporta mais, porém esse Adventure 2 necessita de um e muito, o mesmo pode ser dito pro 1.

Jogue se você quer acompanhar uma baita história e pelas músicas marcantes, talvez ainda se divirta jogando com algum mod que corrija alguns problemas citados, mas eu em geral não gosto muito desse jogo mas também não acho ele ruim.

Talvez seja o porte que não seja tão bom e eu deva ir buscar uma emulação."

 | Nice follow up for the first one, the wizard lost the triangle. Refreshing puzzles and superb graphics. The levels are very nicely designed. Absolutely worth playing! | Пройдя основной сюжет эта игра мне очень понравилась, этот стиль игры в виде сказки, интересный сюжет, не сложные но интересные головоломки, разнообразие прохождения этих головоломок да и игры в целом, а без Амадея я бы надолго застревал на локациях, ну и музыка при битве с финальным боссом - моё почтение. Очень интересная игра, она точно стоит того чтобы её приобрести, 10/10. (делали ведь раньше игры...) | Trine 2 - наверное, самая сложная игра в серии, и займет на 100% прохождение больше, чем любая другая игра в серии. Геймплей остался прежним: решаем головоломки за трех персонажей сразу и сражаемся со врагами.

Сюжет: в игре появились гоблины, и они украли жену одного из главных героев. Мы должны ее спасти и помешать гоблинам в их планах. Сюжет в этой части самый слабый, по моему мнению. Он просто неинтересный.

Сложность: сложность состоит в том, что чтобы пройти игру на 100%, необходимо играть на сложности хардкор: вы не можете постоянно перерождаться, а враги бьют очень больно. Также, шанс умереть при прохождении головоломок довольно высок. Как только я начал хардкор, я офигел от того, какие здесь ужасные враги и какое их здесь количество.

Также, есть просто тонна склянок с опытом, которые надо собрать, чтобы пройти игру на 100%. И эти штуки НИКАК не отмечаются и скрыты очень хитро. Скорее всего, вам придется смотреть видео, где люди показывают местонахождение этих склянок.

А так, Trine 2 - это хороший сиквел, который добавляет новые механики, но усложняет прохождение на 100% в 100 раз соответственно.

Кол-во ачивок - 97 (сложные); кол-во карточек - 5. | It is a very beautiful platformer with working co-op, so I give it a recommend, ¡However! Do not play the game past the ending! There is some kind of post-launch DLC after the ending, and instead of jumping around pretty castles, you have to jump around some intenstines, and that's as difgusting as it sounds.

Hauptproblem sind letztlich aber die kaum vorhandenen Mitspieler. Schade das man nicht auf die Idee kam auch Koop-PvE und Bots als Ersatz für menschliche Gegner für PvP einzufügen.

This game has a ton of potential to grow, and can be very prominent as a game. However, the fact that it is not original in itself compared to the actual banner saga game, and the fact that no one is able to play the game, as there is no one to play against in this multiplayer only game, makes this game a little less than promising. I would not waste time on this until the developers work on the game to increase popularity, through advertising or working on the game's content, of which it is lacking, if at all.

If you wish for a surface level horde shooter with fun abilities then it will give you that experience in spades, however, it also has the ability to allow you to delve deeper into its systems and lets you customize and maximize your arsenal until you become a walking army.

The story is serviceable in the beginning but in my opinion ages like wine as you progress through the star chart, slowly pulling you into an experience that I have yet to relive in any other Sci-Fi game I've played. While it does go off the rails at times it does so in a way that feels believable and maintains a sense of internal consistency that keeps you informed while still asking questions.

Each frame feels unique even though the devs have released over 50 differing characters, each with a unique kit that (while falling into a manageable amount of categories such as caster vs weapons-platform) still allows players to express their own uniqueness through their selection of frames and weapons. It is rare that any two players' loadouts will be identical to one another.

It is definitely a game I recommend everyone to play at least once and one I definitely recommend to anyone who loves long grinds, deep (though sometimes confusing) mechanical systems, and extreme horde shooters. | Better Destiny"
76561198041304371,238960,Path of Exile,0.2833333333333333,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Free To Play",0,"Path of Exile (POE) não é um MMORPG, como a maioria o classifica. POE é, na verdade, um action-RPG online. Você não tem necessariamente que interagir com outros jogadores se não o quiser, e mesmo que o queira, sua interação é limitada apenas a um chat global e a alguns poucos (5) jogadores que você, por ventura, permita que entrem em sua equipe (party).

Considerado o sucessor verdadeiro do Diablo II pelos mais saudosistas, Path of Exile é um jogo bastante interessante para quem gosta de RPGs hack-and-slash com uma grande gama de possibilidades em suas builds. Com uma árvore de habilidades de mais de 1300 pontos diferentes além de um complexo sistema de crafting, cada personagem torna-se único em seu potencial, apesar de, no momento, não ter tantas possibilidades de customização visual.

Após mais de 4000 horas jogadas, sinto-me confiante que posso dar o verdadeiro valor ao jogo nessa análise sem, no entanto, deixar de considerar seus pontos fracos. Por isso, vamos por partes:

[h1]Conceito e Existência[/h1]
Path of Exile é um jogo que foi desenvolvido desde seu início para dar aos saudosistas jogadores de Diablo II um ar de renovação. Chris Wilson, o líder do projeto, e seus companheiros fundaram uma empresa chamada Grinding Gear Games, a atual responsável pelo gerenciamento do jogo, e decidiram dedicar-se exclusivamente ao desenvolvimento de POE.

Seguindo o modelo original de Diablo II, o Path of Exile tem point-of-view semelhante, embora com gráficos melhores e atualizados para uma nova geração (inclusive, recentemente, recebendo suporte a DirectX 11 e algumas funcionalidades exclusivas deste), além de conter o mesmo 'feeling' de grinding que tanto tornou Diablo II famoso.

[h1]Jogabilidade[/h1]
Com uma árvore de habilidades de mais de 1300 opções, além de 6 raças iniciais, POE tem uma jogabilidade altamente imersível e de grande liberdade aos jogadores. Ao criar um personagem, você tem uma série de quests que devem ser seguidas sob uma história modelo, dividida em dez atos e em duas partes. Ao finalizar a primeira parte da história, você parte para a segunda, com uma dificuldade maior, já que você recebe algumas penalidades.

Terminada a parte da história e com seu personagem por volta do level 60 (level 100 sendo o máximo), você parte então para o conteúdo end-game do jogo, que consiste, na maior parte do tempo, 'rodar' mapas (mais de 100 tipos diferentes) em dificuldades diferentes em busca de mais level e/ou itens raros e ajudar Zana, uma NPC, na guerra do atlas. É aí que o grinding se torna interessante para pessoas que gostam (como eu). Para as que não gostam, você pode simplesmente começar de novo se quiser e tentar novas e divertidas builds.

Para se ter uma ideia dos níveis de grinding do jogo, estima-se que a possibilidade de dropar um dos itens mais raros do jogo (Espelho de Kalandra) seja de uma vez a cada dez anos se você jogar cerca de 4 horas por dia. É bastante, de fato, mas seu alto valor no jogo faz com que todos sonhem com a possibilidade de tornarem-se ricos da noite pro dia.

Os servidores são divididos em ligas. Há a liga permanente softcore e a permanente hardcore. A diferença entre uma e outra consiste no fato de que, se você morrer com seu personagem na liga hardcore, ele será automaticamente transferido para a liga softcore (ao contrário de Diablo, onde você perde o personagem).

Há também as ligas temporárias, normalmente lançadas a cada 2 ou 3 meses. Elas oferecem um ""fresh start"", ou seja, um início fresco para aqueles que não querem se submeter à inflacionada economia das ligas permanentes ou simplesmente desejam tentar se perpetuarem como ricos comerciantes ou crafters de itens nas novas ligas. Note que, ao final de cada liga, seus personagens lá localizados, bem como o baú da sua conta, serão transferidos para as ligas permanentes.

[h1]Gráficos[/h1]
Além do que pode se ver nas próprias imagens, Path of Exile não é um jogo que possa se dizer ser muito voltado ao desenvolvimento de belos gráficos. Os gráficos são sim medianos, mas mantém-se sempre atualizados com o que há de moderno no mundo dos jogos. Há cerca de um ano, como já mencionado, o jogo recebeu suporte a DirectX 11, além de alguns efeitos especiais a mais (como o movimento responsivo de capas e asas de personagens a skills ou até mesmo o vento). Na mesma época o jogo também recebeu portabilidade para o Xbox.

Sua customização visual também não é muito rica (por enquanto), sendo você, na maior parte do tempo, obrigado a ficar preso ao visual de seus itens e de sua raça (não há diferença de sexos, por exemplo - se você escolher raça X onde o personagem é, por padrão, feminino, ele continuará sendo feminino). Toda e qualquer customização visual não padrão, ou seja, que não é próprio do item que você esteja usando, é paga. A única exceção são as recompensas fornecidas no final de cada liga. Apesar disso, no último ano, a GGG tem investido bastante nesse quesito, com uma notável melhora.

O jogo tem atenção exclusiva da Grinding Gear Games, sua empresa gerenciadora. Com um início difícil de 5 funcionários, ela hoje conta com mais de 150 pessoas em dedicação exclusiva, fazendo com que seu suporte seja um dos mais efetivos que eu já tenha visto (enviei cerca de 10 a 15 tickets e a média de tempo para resposta deles foi de 5 minutos - é incrível).

[h1]Comunidade[/h1]
Você pode escolher interagir com a comunidade ou não. Esse é o principal fator que faz com que Path of Exile não seja, per-se, um MMORPG, onde, por definição, você é obrigado a interagir com um universo de jogadores. No geral, a comunidade de Path of Exile é bastante amigável e disposta a ajudar, mas, como em todo jogo, há bastantes trolls e, principalmente, scammers.

O [i]scam[/i] é legalizado no jogo desde que não seja através de transações da vida real (ou RMT - do inglês, [i]real money trading[/i]). De acordo com o próprio Chris Wilson, a empresa tenta não realizar nenhum tipo de regulação do mercado dentro do jogo, logo cabe a cada jogador tomar conta de seus itens e analisar seu devido valor antes de se desfazer dele para outro jogador. Ainda segundo ele, no jogo, [i]'knowledge is power, and power is everything'[/i] (conhecimento é poder, e poder é tudo).

No começo, não foram poucas as vezes que fui enganado por jogadores mais experientes, comprando a preço de banana mercadorias que poderiam valer bem mais caso eu soubesse seu devido valor, por isso recomendo cautela a jogadores novatos.

[h1]Pay-to-win?[/h1]
[b]Não.[/b] Não há sequer um fator que possa ser considerado pay-to-win em todo o jogo. Tudo que é adquirido por dinheiro real é por mero conceito de embelezamento e/ou [i]status quo[/i]. O único fator que possa ser considerado pay-to-win para alguns jogadores (eu não considero, no entanto) é o fato de que, ao criar uma nova conta, você recebe gratuitamente 3 abas no baú e para adquirir mais abas você deve dispor de dinheiro real.

No entanto, é bem comum o conceito de [i]mules[/i] no jogo, onde você cria vários personagens (você pode criar mais de 20 ao todo) para guardar itens dentro de seus inventários, o que não faz com que seja um fator limitante aos jogadores que não desejam pagar por conteúdo dentro do jogo.

[h1]Conclusão[/h1]
Path of Exile é uma obra-prima dos action-RPGs onlines. Sem dúvida o melhor do gênero, com a melhor companhia de jogos existente da atualidade em sua direção, mas eu, obviamente, sou suspeito a falar, já que ""desperdicei"" (e com orgulho) mais de 3000 horas da minha vida no jogo. Se você gosta de jogos com bastante [i]grinding[/i] e com uma grande gama de possibilidades de ações, sugiro que teste Path of Exile.

[h1]Nota: 9.5/10[/h1]
Pontos positivos:
[+] Grinding complexo
[+] Grande gama de possibilidades
[+] Árvore de habilidades com mais de 1300 opções
[+] Ligas que oferecem um começo igual a todos

Pontos negativos:
[-] Baixa gama de customização visual (mas que tem melhorado no último ano) | Yoa so nach knapp 4k std. Spielzeit kann ich wohl mal ein Review verfassen :P.

F2P oder P2W ? => Es ist wirklich F2P, man kann alle Charaktäre Fähigkeiten etc verwenden und ausspielen, es gibt kein EXP Boost oder ähnliches.

Wie finanziert sich die Firma hinter dem Spiel ? => MTX ähnlich wie in Dota gibt es Armor, Waffen und Fähigkeits ""Skins"" welche das Spiel selber aber nicht beeinflussen. 

Also muss man kein Geld ausgeben ? 
=> Jaein xD, wenn man sehr viel spielt und einem das Spiel nun wirklich gefällt sollte man seinen Stash(Truhe) erweitern, hier nimmt man dann mal 20€ in die Hand (wenn dir dieses Spiel keine 20€ wert ist dann lass es halt ^^), für dieses Spiel allerdings noch zu wenig bei dem was es dir bietet. 
Ich persönlich spiel das Spiel seit der closed Beta(2013) und habe zu jedem kostenlosen DLC ( ein DLC bietet ca so viel Umfang wie Diablo III insgesamt, es gibt bereits 5 DLC´s) der Firma GrindingGearGames etwas Geld zukommen lassen und hab mir davon Stash Erweiterungen und Skins gekauft.

Ist es Einsteiger freundlich ? 
=> Auch hier ein Jaein, wer bereits viele Action RPG`s gezockt hat wird etwas schneller ins Spiel finden, wer keine Erfahrungen hat wird es sehr schwer haben aber gut Ding will Weile haben :P.
Also einfach Google nutzen und man wird schnell merken das die PoE Community ins gesamt nett und freundlich ist und es gibt ne menge Anfänger guides von größeren Streamern. Hier und da sollte man also bei Twitch.tv sich Builds in Action ansehen oder im Forum einen Build heraussuchen ;).
Und lasst euch nicht vom Skill Baum abschrecken, man wird diesen lieben wenn man das Spiel mehr und mehr versteht, genau dieser bietet einen unglaubliche Freiheiten seinen Charakter einzigartig zu machen und evtl. einen wirklich guten Build zu erstellen.

Ist es auf deutsch spielbar ?
=> JA!!!!, es ist nun möglich es auf DEUTSCH zu stellen !!!!! ;-)  

Diablo III oder POE ?
=> Ich spiele beides, aber PoE bietet sag ich mal 10x so viel und ist F2P , auch grafisch mag ich PoE mehr da es düsterer, brutaler und gnadenloser ist.

Gibt es einen Harcore Modus ?
=> Ja, der gestorbene Charakter landet in Sofcore. Anders als in Diablo III gibt es keine passive Fähigkeit die dich retten kann.

Ist die Story gut erzählt ?
=>Nein, keine tollen Videos und auch kaum Vertonung, der Fokus lag wie es richtig ist, auf dem Gameplay, aber mitlerweile wird mehr und mehr vertont und nachgebessert.

Gibt es ein Late-Game ?
=> Ja und zwar ein absolut geaniales Late-Game !, mit lvl 60 ist man ca. fertig mit der Story welche man 3mal durchpielt (Normal,Cruel,Merciless), nach einiger Erfahrung geht das ziemlich schnell. Im Late-Game läuft man Maps welche durch Portale geöffnet werden und zufällig generiert werden, der Name der Map gibt einem Info darüber wie das Layout ca aussehen wird und welcher Boss auf einem wartet, auch hier die PoE wiki nutzen oder Ytube Videos schauen wie der Boss Fight ablaufen wird.

Gibt es einen Trade Markt wo Spieler untereinander handeln ?
=> JA, es gibt kein Gold oder ähnliches, im Spiel findet man Orbs welche zu Iteam craften genutzt werden können oder auch als Währung, dabei sind diese aufgrund ihrer verschiedenen Seltenheit unterschiedlich viel Wert, am Ende ist es ehher ein tausch System, ich gebe dir ``x`` von und du gibst mir deine Armor.
 
Am Ende kann ich nur sagen das es sich hier um ein Spiel handelt, für welches man viel Zeit haben sollte, der Anfang wird sehr schwer sein da es sehr viele Meschaniken gibt, wenn du also ein Spiel suchst an dem du dich messen kannst und dich frei entwickeln kannst bist du bei PoE genau richtig.

Hier noch ein paar links zu Seiten dich euch sicher weiter helfen werden ;)

http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Path_of_Exile_Wiki <-- Wiki

http://www.pathofexile.com/forum <--- zum Build heraus suchen unter Classes / Builds

www.twitch.tv <--- hier einfach mal Builds live in Action anschauen und evtl Leute im Chat um Hilfe bitten, wie gesagt ist der große Teil der Community sehr nett, liegt vermutlich daran das es nicht competitive ist ^^.

MfG Schlomo und viel Spaß beim spielen !!!! | La verdad es que era bastante reticente a probar este juego. En primer lugar, no me gustan los ""free2play"". Suelen acabar en ""pay 2 win"", comunidades tóxicas, DLCs sospechosamente obligatorios, y una calidad general bastante baja. Además, tengo todos los Diablo comprados, desde el I al III con todas sus expansiones. Teniendo el original, ¿para que jugar a un clon? 

Pues Path of Exile me ha sorprendido. 

En primer lugar, en la tienda del juego sólo venden objetos cosméticos, espacio de almacenamiento, y packs de soporte. Nada que afecte al desarrollo del personaje o al poder de los objetos.

En cuanto al desarrollo del personaje, el juego tiene 19 clases de partida. Pero no son clases cerradas, sino más bien ""zonas de inicio"" que puedes desarrollar a través de un árbol con cientos (literalmente) de skills pasivos. 

Tiene mucho contenido, diez actos. Muchas misiones secundarias, aleatorias, y tramas paralelas (maestros, refugio, etc...). Cada cierto tiempo abren una liga, en la que todos los jugadores empiezan de cero y hay algún evento específico.

La ambientación del mundo es muy siniestra, a ratos realmente gore. Me gusta la historia. Gráficamente no están mal, aunque no está a la altura de Diablo. 

El sistema de juego está lleno de buenas ideas. Por ejemplo, no hay habilidades activas, se consiguen a través de gemas que se engarzan en el equipo. Las gemas pueden subirse de nivel, y hasta hay gemas de soporte que potencian el efecto de otras gemas. 

Hay pociones, como en Diablo 2, pero se rellenan solas cuando matas enemigos, no tienes que llevar 500 pociones en el inventario.

Sistema de crafting básico y avanzado. Se pueden mejorar y alterar los objetos, reforjar estadísticas, etc...

En resumen, un ARPG hardcore, con una curva de aprendizaje un poco bestia al principio, pero con muchísimas posibilidades. Encima gratis y sin pay2win. No sé que más se puede pedir. |

Os jogadores têm uma grande variedade de classes iniciais para escolher, mas cada classe serve apenas como o ponto de partida inicial para a progressão do personagem de um jogador.

Os jogadores têm a sua disponibilidade uma enorme quantidade de gemas (skill gems) e opções passivas da skill tree. As gemas podem ser encaixadas no equipamento do personagem e concedem uma escala larga das habilidades, que dependem do tipo e da cor da gema. As gemas podem até subir de nível para fornecer uma versão mais forte da skill. A árvore de habilidades é um conjunto vasto e complexo de combinações de skills passivas. Cada jogador pode escolher entre uma enorme variedade de alocações pontuais para realmente personalizar a sua classe de personagens.

Path of Exile apresenta tanto PvE e PvP com eventos como corridas de nivelamento que ocorrem em servidores dedicados. Outras variações incluem um modo Cut-Throat, onde os jogadores podem invadir instâncias de outros jogadores e matá-los para levar seus itens. Cada evento pode durar de apenas uma hora a vários meses e premiar valiosos prêmios para os vencedores. Os fãs da mecânica de rastreamento de dungeons (*dungeon crawling) mais tradicionais encontrados no Diablo 2 devem definitivamente dar uma chance ao Path of Exile.

*Sistema [b]dungeon crawling[/b]:

O sistema de [b]dungeon crawling[/b] é um tipo de cenário em jogos de role-playing de fantasia em que os heróis navegam em um ambiente labiríntico, lutando contra vários monstros e saqueando qualquer tesouro que possam encontrar. Devido à sua simplicidade, o dungeon crawling pode ser mais fácil para um *gamemaster executar do que aventuras mais complexas, e o estilo de ""hack and slash"" é apreciado por jogadores que se concentram em ação e combate.

*Um [b]gamemaster[/b] ( GM , também conhecido como mestre de jogo , gerente de jogo , moderador de jogo ou árbitro ) é uma pessoa que atua como um organizador, oficiante para perguntas sobre regras, arbitragem para um jogo de RPG multiplayer .Eles são mais comuns em jogos cooperativos em que os jogadores trabalham juntos do que em jogos competitivos em que os jogadores se opõem uns aos outros. O ato realizado por um gamemaster é às vezes referido como ""Gamemastering"" ou simplesmente ""GM-ing"".
O papel básico do gamemaster é o mesmo em quase todos os jogos tradicionais de role-playing, embora diferentes conjuntos de regras tornam os deveres específicos do gamemaster exclusivo para esse sistema.

[b]Prós:[/b]

-Bons gráficos que trabalham mesmo em PCs low-end, efeitos sonoros de alta fidelidade.
-Boa história
-Ambientação e efeitos bem elaborados, ótimo final.
-Totalmente free to play.
-Se você decidir investir dinheiro, todos os preços estão bem equilibrados.
-Muitos itens
-Cópia fiel ao Diablo 2
-Skill tree avançada 

[b]Contras:[/b]

-Alguns problemas de atraso e desconexões aleatórias, Não posso dizer que é perfeito, mas eu jogo tranquilamente com ping bem baixo. Porém, vejo algumas pessoas com problemas de vez em quando.
-Pontos de controle são muito distantes, por esse motivo o jogador tem que correr para o objetivo com a necessidade de perder alguns minutos em vez de usar o teleporte para checkpoints, que são muito longes do objetivo da missão.
- Customizaçao de personagens.


Lendo o site ficou claro que foi produzido de fã para fãs, devido a frases como:

[i] - ""Totalmente gratuito e nunca será pay to win""
- ""Estamos cansados da moda de fadas e luzes, Path Of Exile é realístico e escuro""[/i] 
E muitas outras...

Path Of Exile está de parabéns e merece respeito já por isto, recomendo para jogadores assíduos e que veneram o estilo Old School.


[b]Nota final 8/10.[/b]

 | Первый обзор, постараюсь кратко и со смыслом.

Отличный аналог Диабло, не могу сказать что он лучше или хуже, но для проекта, который создавался на минимум бюджета, оооочень недурственно. 
  Из плюсов: 
- Очень улыбнула графика. Она выдержана в своем стиле, сразу переносишься во времена Diablo2, когда было все ради фана и атмосферы.
- Для небольшого количества героев, просто огромный выбор классов. Благодаря системе развития пассивных навыков, это просто надо увидеть и попробовать, лично я остался под огромным впечатлением. Можно конечно канониченых магов, лучников и варов делать, но так же невесело. +)
- Понравился сюжетный режим. Несомненный плюс в прохождении с друзьями, опять таки за счет того, что билды героев нестандартны и очень вариотивны. Можно творить все, что вздумается, а это большая редкость для РПГ.
- Система активных скилов и крафта выполнена на высоте. Аналогов я просто не встречал, просто один раз попробовать и самому увидеть лучше, чем сто раз прочитать любой из обзоров.
  Из минусов:
- Лично для меня из минусов стала мини карта и ее большой брат, очень тускло, постоянно режет глаза. Но на это можно забить большой болт. Лично мое мнение.
- Есть еще один момент, касаемо новичков. Придется много читать статей и гайдов по героям, ибо настает момент, когда Вы попросту можете дальше не пройти из-за своего билда, нестандартаня раскачка весло, но может стать занозой в ягодной части при прохождении в соло. Опять таки может это у меня руки кривые, а у Вас все получится. +)

По итогу. В PoE обязательно стоит попробовать полиграть всем ценителям РПГ жанра, я уверяю тебя уважаемый читатель, равнодушным проект не оставит, хоть сначала может показаться странным и тяжеловатым. Но. Оно того определенно стоит. Ни разу не пожалел проведенного времени, жаль мало набегал, ибо все время свободное отнимает КС.

This is absolutely beautiful.
And I just have to mention the music of Ben Babbitt separately - together with the story, it did so much to me. | Kentucky Route Zero is a ""capital A"" arthouse game, which makes it a tough sell as a commercial product. I liked its themes of displacement, and the game is at its best when it is moving quickly between stunningly framed tableaux and evocative character vignettes. However, the majority of the experience is brutally slow, and I lost patience well before Kentucky Route Zero was finished introducing its large cast of characters, which muted the overall impact of the story.

I respect what Kentucky Route Zero is trying to do, but ultimately I can't think of anyone that I personally know to whom I could recommend this game. | What I liked: attractive, spare animation; smart writing about big topics (class, wage slavery, environment); outstanding music. What I didn't like: it felt like my choices had no effect on the story, and I didn't feel connected with the characters. Perhaps rolling out the phases of the game over many years meant that the designers changed their mind over time about some things, but yeah, there were some choices that didn't make sense to me (like Conway's arc). I didn't finish Act V because I lost interest. | I love this game. Surreal, funny, and emotionally resonant. If you like David Lynch, play this game. | Definitely a work of art. It's not just a game, it's an interactive movie experience. If you’re into titles like Inside, Somerville, Journey, or anything with that Lynch-esque, mystery-fueled vibe, you’re gonna love this one."

76561198041304371,8870,BioShock Infinite,11.016666666666667,Action,18,"Я в захваті наскільки прекрасно виглядає гра у 2025 році. Це моє друге проходження, перше було ще в далекому 2013-у і грав я на відрі з гайками, але в пам'яті збереглись спогади та емоції які я відчував під час проходження. Це і стало стимулом зіграти в цю шедевральну гру ще раз. Також хочу сказати що такого красивого неба як у BioShock Infinite я вже давно не бачив ні в одному сучасному проєкті. Більше сказати нічого, 10/10 | ""BioShock Infinite"" is a remarkable game that combines intense action with thought-provoking narrative and stunning world-building. Released in 2013 by Irrational Games, it builds upon the success of its predecessors while delivering a fresh, yet familiar experience. Set in the floating city of Columbia, the game introduces players to Booker DeWitt, a man tasked with rescuing a mysterious girl named Elizabeth. As the story unfolds, players are thrust into a world of political intrigue, social unrest, and philosophical exploration, with themes ranging from American exceptionalism to the nature of reality itself.

One of the standout features of ""BioShock Infinite"" is its narrative complexity. The plot takes unexpected twists, keeping players on their toes as they navigate the layers of conspiracy and mystery. Booker and Elizabeth’s relationship evolves in a compelling way, and their dynamic drives much of the emotional weight of the story. Elizabeth herself is a unique character, not only because of her abilities—such as opening ""tears"" in space-time—but also because of her depth and growth throughout the game. The bond between Booker and Elizabeth becomes central to the experience, and the way the game unfolds keeps the player invested in their journey.

The world of Columbia is incredibly well-crafted, with vibrant, meticulously detailed environments that stand in stark contrast to the darker themes of the game. The floating city feels like a living, breathing entity, with its own history, culture, and class divides. The design of Columbia, from its patriotic aesthetic to its underlying dystopian nature, provides a striking commentary on American society and the consequences of unchecked nationalism. The game's use of music, especially the incorporation of old-timey renditions of modern songs, further enhances the atmosphere and immersion.

Gameplay-wise, ""BioShock Infinite"" is engaging and intense. The shooting mechanics are fluid, and the introduction of the Skyhook, which allows players to move across railways in the air, adds a unique verticality to the combat. The combination of gunplay, strategic use of Vigors (special powers), and Elizabeth’s ability to open tears creates a dynamic combat system that requires both quick reflexes and tactical thinking. The game encourages exploration, rewarding players with lore, upgrades, and narrative elements that deepen the story.

However, it’s not just the gameplay and world-building that make ""BioShock Infinite"" stand out; it’s also the philosophical depth. The game delves into complex topics like free will, the multiverse theory, and the nature of identity. It challenges players to think critically about the choices they make in the game and how those choices relate to broader existential questions. The ending, in particular, leaves a lasting impact, providing both a satisfying conclusion and a thought-provoking meditation on fate and the consequences of one’s actions.

""BioShock Infinite"" is a masterpiece that blends excellent gameplay with a deep, engaging story. Its themes of freedom, oppression, and the complexity of human nature are explored in a way that feels both personal and universal. The game’s vibrant world, memorable characters, and intricate narrative make it one of the most thought-provoking and visually stunning games of its generation. While it may not appeal to every player, those who appreciate a game that challenges both the mind and the skills will find ""BioShock Infinite"" to be an unforgettable experience.

스토리 소재 자체도 굉장히 흥미로운데 진행과 연출 등등이 굉장히 맛있게 잘 살려주면서 잘 만들어진 게임!


세계관은 기억을 지우기, 타인에게 이전, 재창조 및 조작 등등의 기술력을 기업이 개발하여 초거대기업이 되었고 초거대기업이 세계를 휘어잡고 있다! 라는 사이버펑크적인 세계관!

개인적으로 기억을 조작한다는 부분이 흥미로웠는데 예시로 [spoiler] 술에 취해서 아내와 말다툼을 하다가 화가 나 우발적으로 총을 쏴 아내를 죽였다! 라고 기억을 조작하면 남자는 죄책감으로 자살 해버림 이따가 아내가 방에 들어와 남편의 자살에 충격에 빠지고 [/spoiler] 이런 식으로 조작이 가능 ㄷㄷ..

그리고 스토리 라인중에 또 흥미로웠던게 명확한 선과 악이 없음 ""주인공은 선한 히어로고! 거대기업은 악한 빌런이야!"" 이 개념이 아님 이 부분을 상세하게 적으면 강스포가 되는지라 적진 않을거임 헣


게임성 부분은 전체적으로 굉장히 무난하게 만들었음 어디가 빼어나지도 어디가 모나지도 않음

그래도 아쉬웠던 단점 좀 말하자면

- 시점 관련 하자가 많음 시점 감도가 느린데 조정 불가, 강제 시점, FOV가 매우 좁고 조정 불가

- 주인공 매력이 전혀 없음

- 자신만의 커스텀 콤보 제작 가능이라고 하지만 사실 그런거 없음 X, Y를 변경이 가능한게 아니라 정해진 콤보 버튼마다 딜/힐/쿨감 이 세가지 속성을 어떻게 배정해줄거냐 정하는것일뿐 커스텀 콤보는 없음


커스텀 콤보에 대해 아쉽긴 하지만 전투 액션은 배트맨 시리즈 전투 방식인 프리 플로우식의 전투 방식이라서 답답하지 않고 재미있고 시원했음!



장단점이 많이 있는 게임성이지만 굉장히 흥미로운 배경과 스토리이고 스토리를 더 재미있게 즐길 수 있게 만들어준 진행 라인과 연출, 브금 등등이 잘만들어져있어서 재미있게 플레이 했음! | The game is fine, the story being the highlight and combat being the frustrating part. Hadn't replayed the game in like 10 years, still worth a play through today and it was cool seeing the Memory Remixing stuff now that Cyberpunk 2077 is a thing because Braindances have a similar vibe to this. | Did you watch Minority Report and liked it?  you'll enjoy this game.
Great game.
Remember Me 9/10
Heisen 
 | Jogo muito bom, criativo e com um conceito interessante, porém o combate é frustrante e o ponto fraco do jogo. Eu também tive alguns problemas com bugs de câmera ou não conseguir avançar após matar algum boss. Foi uma boa experiência, mas eu não recomendaria para qualquer um. | Sadly not as nuanced as I hoped it would be. The beginning was so strong with the heart-string-pulling commercial about Sensen, and escaping the jail. But after that, the game slowly started to get less deep and not talk about the crazy/messed up stuff you do, and instead focus more on getting your memories back and saving the world (like every other game out there). I would have loved for the focus to be on how insane it is to mess with someones memories, and whether or not the ends you go to justify the means. After all. we're literally called an Errorist, just short one letter of a controversial term in today's society!! Luckily the twist ending satisfied me just enough, but the journey to get there was a chore. The combat is quite clunky for me, but it's combo creation mechanics are an interesting idea, and would be cool to see in other Capcom titles like Devil May Cry (maybe Street Fighter, but I don't think people would be happy), or better implemented in a sequel. Despite my gripes, I'd still recommend this game to others, as it stars a solid female lead, which is always awesome to see, and it has a nice ensemble of fairly well voice acted characters."

The %of hitting and missing is way off.  It's incredibly common to miss with a 99% change to hit.  One battle I missed 3x in a row.  Anything below 70% is almost a guaranteed miss.  The fact the the hired runners have no armor is absurd.  They are almost useless in a fight.  The game is unbalanced at best. | Игра проходняк, полной стоимости не стоит, проходится часов за 15. Задумка была шикарная, но реализация подвела. Есть рассы, но не нет социального различия. Есть классы, стили общения,но игра короткая и раскрыть их возможности по полной не смогли. Кроме основного сюжета доп. квестов нет, если честно то сама игра выглядит доп. квестом к чему то большему. | Returns is a barebones experience compared to its successors Dragonfall and Hong Kong: linear, straightforward, very light on role-playing. That said, it's a decent Shadowrun story, and it's succinct enough to not overstay its welcome.

Noir-cyberpunk story, with enough mystery to keep you interested and solid combat. Further installments are better, but this one worth the look still. | I purchased this expecting Baldur's Gate with guns. I was very wrong.

It is turn based and linear; you go out on missions, then return to your home to level up, re-supply, pick up side missions, and progress the story.

At first I was disappointed, but the story and atmosphere sucked me in.

Their are 5 races (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Orc, and Troll) and 6 classes (Samurai, Mage, Decker, Rigger, Shaman, Physical Adept) but racial limits on attributes and skills are disappointingly limited. There's no point in making a troll as anything other than a Samurai or Physical Adept, for example, as their racial limits would prevent any other class' skills rising above 6 points (out of 15)

The games also have fan-made campaigns available in the Steam community

[b]Відмінний представник жанру![/b] | Fun Fact: This game actually coined the term ""Roguelite"", to describe Roguelike elements while not actually fitting into the mold of the genre, which is actually a set of rules determined by Roguelike developers of yore in an event called the ""Berlin Convention"". This game is most-assuredly not an actual Roguelike, which is why ""Rogue-LITE"" is used in the marketing material, because it was a brand new term and style of game at the time.

Most games people call ""Roguelikes"" don't actually meet the real criteria, and this has been a source of annoyance for actual Roguelike fans like me for over a decade, since the Roguelite boom, which this game is partially responsible for along with Binding of Isaac. I like Roguelites a lot, this isn't a slight against the genre, but people SERIOUSLY need to distinguish them better.

If you want to know what a real Roguelike looks like, the Genesis game Fatal Labyrinth, the Game Gear version Dragon Crystal, Nethack, Caves of Qud, Angband, Path of Achra, Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead, Quasimorph, Tales of the Maj'Eyal, ADOM, why yes I did just skim Sseth's channel to remember half of these names.

What these games all have in common, are grid-based maps, being turn based, permadeath, zero progression between runs, (""metaprogression"" being out of run progression), a strong focus on being non-modal. meaning every action you can do is always available, peaceful options rarely exist, procedurally generated levels make up most of the game, and ""emergent gameplay"" is prioritized, meaning you have a ton of out-of-the-box options that are all generally accounted for in normal gameplay.

I actually grew up with the 3DS VC version of Dragon Crystal and the PS3 Genesis disc that had Fatal Labyrinth on it. Although, gonna be honest, I played more Dragon Crystal, and when I was playing the PS3 Genesis disc, I was playing Shinobi 3 and Streets of Rage 2, a true classic. That reminds me though, the stellar Phantasy Star 1-4 was also on that disc, and also, the PS2 Shinobi reboot and it's sequel Nightshade are actually peak, despite getting sub-par reviews for the time. Time was very kind to those games despite their insane difficulty, and I don't think I'll have another opportunity to mention those games unless Sega puts them on Steam or something.

Less faithful to the original criteria, but still great examples are the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games, the other Mystery Dungeon spinoffs, and also Shiren The Wanderer by the same team, which has 2 releases on Steam. Also another strange example of a Roguelike is FF X-2 Last Mission, a pack-in on the HD releases of FF X+X-2, in case getting the previously PAL/JP-only vastly superior re-release version of FF X with 14 extra bosses and a better, much more open, Sphere Grid wasn't enough of a bonus.

Rogue Legacy is a very good Roguelite, and it still holds up. As you can see by my playtime, this game was a staple for me in high school, and I still come back to this game and it's sequel. The ""Neo"" fights in this game are entirely unbalanced, but otherwise this game is very, very good. The Donation Box was a new feature to make the ""Neo"" fights less crushing, and it does help a lot, but the big problem is a lot of the Neo fights require playing against your play-style. The equivalents in the sequel are much better, since instead of having set strategies you're required to learn, it's a test of how well you can clear them as each class.

Class dichotomy is also not as good in this game as in it's sequel, and the disabilities provide no compensation like in the sequel. Rogue Legacy 2 is definitely a better game, but that doesn't mean this game is BAD. After all, the sequel came out 7 years later, and hindsight is 20/20. For a while, this was one of the best 2D Roguelites out there, before we got Dead Cells, which I played extremely late, and this game still has plenty of really good ideas, even if it has some design flaws.

A lot of those design flaws really don't become apparent until you've already beaten the game and are on NG+++, so in that regard, Cellar Door succeeded at making a sufficiently well-designed game. Also, as a bonus, Cellar Door included a copy of a fan-made overhaul mod, Lament of Zors, to the game, with permission, as an alternative launch option, and that fan-made mod is very interesting and adds a lot of new areas to the game, and rebalances a lot.

In short, the sequel is a better game, but this is still a great game to come back to, even with the sequel existing. I recommend this game wholeheartedly. I know half the text here ended up talking about other games, and the distinction between Roguelite and Roguelike, but there's not really too much to say about this game itself other than that it's a well-designed action platformer responsible for the Roguelite boom. | Mon temps de jeu parle de lui-même. 
Au fil des années, Rogue Legacy est devenu un de mes jeux conforts. Quand j'avais un petit moment, et pas envie de me lancer dans une grande aventure, je relançais une run, souvent deux, trois, quatre, car le Rogue-Like est spécialement addictif. 
Et puis voilà, 10ans après l'avoir lancé pour la première fois, je viens de le 100%, avec un plaisir inégalé à parcourir les 4 biomes et à en buter tous les ennemis tout en récupérant mon précieux argent. Aucune lassitude ne s'est jamais fait ressentir chez moi, seulement de la frustration parfois, dont j'étais le seul responsable, mort par orgueil d'avoir voulu faire une salle trop difficile, ou d'avoir relancé une run de trop. Le jeu est dur, mais juste. Un vrai bijou du Rogue-lite- Plateforme. | I really liked the generational aspect of it, where you play as the various iterations on one bloodline.

Permadeath is super annoying in a co-op. Losing all your progress and then playing through the exact same dungeon again is super demotivating. We tried playing with infinite lives, but then it trivialized the game -- there was no penalty at all for death.

Also, the fact that every player controls every menu simultaneously led to a let of misclicks. My partner opened a vendor while I was attacking things, and my button press bought something for them. Worse, later they paused the game while I was attacking things, and my button press quit the game. There wasn't even an ""are you sure?"" dialog, it just immediately quit and we lost everything. This tipped it into thumbs down for me. | es ist ein tolles spiel das mich meine ganze Kindheit begleitet hat ich rate euch das Spiel zu kaufen !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | Amazing modern version of gauntlet, love the pixel art and crt filters | A campanha principal é um dos melhores Dungeon Crawleres que eu já joguei, só que depois que saiu o Heroes deu pra ver que a mecânica é bem limitada.

76561198041304371,47790,Medal of Honor™,0.5333333333333333,Action,0,"Medal of Honor 2010 года - это игра, которая оставила глубокий след в сердцах многих игроков, особенно тех, кто вырос на классических шутерах про Вторую мировую войну. Перезапуск серии, перенесший действие в современность, стал смелым шагом, который вызвал как восторг, так и споры. Сегодня, спустя годы, хочется оглянуться назад и вспомнить, что сделало эту игру особенной.

Сюжет и атмосфера игры перенесла нас в Афганистан, в разгар войны с талибами. В отличие от своих предшественников, игра сделала ставку на реализм и драматизм, вдохновляясь реальными событиями. Сюжет рассказывал о спецназовцах Tier 1 и обычных солдатах, показывая войну с разных сторон. Это была не просто стрелялка, а попытка передать тяжесть и трагизм конфликта.

Атмосфера игры была мрачной и напряженной. Пустынные пейзажи Афганистана, горные перевалы, разрушенные деревни - всё это создавало ощущение опасности и одиночества. Звуковое сопровождение, особенно саундтрек, добавляло глубины и эмоциональности. Помните тот момент, когда вы шли через снежные горы под тревожную музыку? Это было незабываемо.

Геймплей был классическим для шутеров того времени, но с акцентом на реализм. Оружие ощущалось мощным и весомым, а перестрелки требовали тактического подхода. Игра не боялась замедлять темп, давая нам время на размышления и осознание происходящего. Миссии варьировались от скрытных операций до масштабных сражений, что добавляло разнообразия.

Особенно запомнились миссии за Tier 1, где нужно было действовать скрытно и точно. А вот эпизоды за обычных солдат иногда казались более хаотичными, но именно это передавало хаос реального боя. Конечно, игра не была идеальной - некоторые моменты казались линейными, а ИИ противника порой вызывал вопросы. Но в целом, геймплей оставлял приятное впечатление.

Для 2010 года графика в Medal of Honor была на высоте. Детализация персонажей, окружающей среды и эффектов впечатляла. Конечно, сегодня графика может показаться устаревшей, но в своё время она была одним из главных козырей игры.

Шутер не стал коммерческим прорывом, но оставил важный след в истории игровой индустрии. Это была попытка вернуть серию в строй, переосмыслить её и адаптировать к современным реалиям. К сожалению, сиквел Medal of Honor: Warfighter не смог повторить успех, и серия ушла в закат. Но для многих игроков именно эта часть осталась последним ярким воспоминанием о франшизе.

Сегодня Medal of Honor 2010 года - это не просто игра, а ностальгическое напоминание о времени, когда шутеры начали экспериментировать с сюжетами и атмосферой. Она не была идеальной, но её смелость, драматизм и попытка показать войну с человеческой стороны заслуживают уважения. Если у вас есть возможность, вернитесь в неё снова - возможно, вы откроете для себя что-то новое или просто насладитесь воспоминаниями о тех временах, когда Medal of Honor снова стала частью наших игровых вечеров. | Кратенькая сюжетная история,но интересная.Удивительно,что боты,которые играют за тебя,не руины,а действительно помогают(хотя часто бывало перед моим оружием вставали)

 | A great old school game forgotten by time…. I miss the MOH series, I revisited this game 15 years later, it does suffers from poor optimisation and a lot of texture pop in, and the game is rather stiff compared to modern games. Replaying this now I would give this a solid 6/10.

Pros
Good story
Likeable characters.
Story is around 3-5 hours depending on skill.

Cons
Poor optimisation
Clunky controls | If you can find it on deep discount then the single player will provide you with a historically authentic spec ops experience. The voice actors talk like real spec ops units. They got real guys from spec ops to consult and it shows....The only setback is the short campaign and linear level design.....Still worth checking out. 

Multiplayer has been shut down | really good game which reminded me of the good old CoD games combined with battlefield. Better than the new CoD games but i prefer games like MW2 or BO1. still a great game which makes a lot of fun."

Mecânica fora da curva. | One of the most fun multiplayer games that I've ever played. While I may have 9 hours on Steam at the time of writing this, I had a lot more time on my console, so I can understand what I'm saying. 

The best way to experience this game is by playing with friends. The thrill of trying to survive against each other in a wide variety of maps with some optional modes is unforgettable, I still giggle whenever I think about some of the moments that I've had in this game with friends.

Quick Play can be pretty harsh, mostly everyone there has already developed the best techniques to gain high speeds in milliseconds so I did not have the best time in that mode, but I have found a few casual players every now and then that were fun to fight against.

The Campaign can be pretty thrilling to play. While yes, I was racing against bots, it managed to be pretty intense every time with Unfair mode. I go back to it sometimes, which I can't say for most of the games that I love in my library.

Basically, the best way to play this game is by playing with friends, Quick Play can often be hell, and the Campaign is very thrilling even if you are playing against bots.

I also got most of the achievements, excluding ones that would require another playthrough. Overall, it was pretty fun. I enjoyed it straight the way through. At first it started a bit slow, but by the end you have so many upgrades and abilities that you can just mess around with that it makes up for the slow start. I will say, earlier on, when you don't have all of the abilities, some traversal and combat feels a bit awkward and clunky, but I suppose that is a part of a lot of metroidvanias to a certain extent. 

Steamworld Dig really reminded me of a flash game called Mega Miner (all time goat of the genre by the way). I am not sure if this game was inspired by that or if it was the other way around or if they have no connection at all, but it felt insanely similar. I will say that I definitely prefer Mega Miner, and for most of the game I was just thinking ""Man, I wish I was playing Mega Miner right now."" That isn't a knock to this game necessarily, I just have a lot of nostalgia for Mega Miner, and I think that it had executed so many things perfectly (the main thing I prefered from Mega Miner over Steamworld Dig was the traversal). All that said, for a game I got on sale for $.89, it was totally worth the time and money, and I'm sure I will get around to playing the sequel sometime soon. 

The game does a good job of constantly giving you a new upgrade or ability to mess around with, and pretty much all of them were fun to use. The caves/mini-dungeons were also fun side challenges that hid some secrets for bonus rewards. I never felt myself really getting frustrated with the game, as even dying just means losing a bit of money and starting back up at the surface. You can still go back and claim your loot too.

There isn't much to say about the story, it is pretty basic, but they do set up for the sequel at the end of the game, so that had me a bit more interested in the story. 

I'd give this game a solid 6.5/10, it is a great starting point, and I am interested to see how the next game expands on it. | This game has been a lot of fun I enjoyed the exploration, the enemies, characters, the mining and all sorts this has been a really fun game worth playing if you love Metroidvanias. | Juegazo, en unas 4 horas te lo pasas tranquilamente, si quieres platinar ahi ya te vas a tardar, por otro lado, buena historia | La idea de excavar y mejorar al personaje es interesante, pero la ejecución se siente demasiado limitada.

A few relatively minor complaints aside, Borderlands 2 improves not only the narrative, but almost every major game system.

Just like Diablo or a number of other action RPGs, the hunt for loot becomes intoxicating because of the tiny rush you get each time a rare colored item spills out of a chest or is dropped by a recently slain enemy. Every firefight and intense boss battle becomes all the more rewarding, because, though you might die a few times and want to crush something near you in real life, it suddenly feels like everything is going to be OK when you’re blasting away enemies with a newly looted gun. | só tem gente perturbada, armas, violência, animais perigosos, uma milicia que quer controlar tudo, nenhum policial á vista e um ambiente inóspito a vida humana.

Você passa um bom tempo jogando como se ele fosse um jogo qualquer, quando na verdade o rumo que se deve ter é completamente diferente. Darkest Dungeon é uma das minhas experiências mais difíceis que eu tive nos últimos anos com jogos. A jogabilidade é extremamente punitiva, nociva caso não saiba o que está fazendo. Um dos núcleos do jogo, é o dinheiro. É necessário entrar nas missões (dungeons), se importar com fazer dinheiro, sua sobrevivência e ainda completar o seu objetivo. Conciliar todos esses fatores, transforma a experiência em um ciclo maçante de fazer dinheiro e upar personagens para o final do jogo. Penso que essa ferramenta utilizada para ser a ponte principal do Darkest Dungeon, pode ser bem mal vista para quem pensa em zerar o jogo.

Mas, além de tudo, gostaria de enaltecer a arte característica e virtuosa, que transmite perfeitamente a atmosfera obscura das dungeons, da sofrência e do medo. A direção artística voltada ao tema ""Lovecrafteana"", é muito bem feito, principalmente no que se diz progressão visual. Os ambientes se tornando mais medonhas cada vez que você vai progredindo para o final do jogo, a mudança de cores voltadas ao cosmo e carnificina ou até mesmo as músicas que passam de um violino arranhado e agitado para algo mais ""contemplador""

Por fim, vai minha dica:
- Se você quiser uma experiência menos massiva, jogue na dificuldade Radiante
- Caso queira sofrer um pouco mais, tendo que repetir missões para ficar mais forte, jogue na Mais Escura
- E se você for um mutante, jogue na mais difícil mesmo, é uma experiência semelhante a estar em um quarto branco com camisa de força no corpo | This is a game I played on an off for years, and both loved it and grew frustrated by it as I played.  This last year I decided it was time to beat the game finally, so I dedicated a bit more of my gaming time to it, and feel I can give some fairly informed thoughts on the game.  

Darkest Dungeon has a fun party management system that is well designed and the heart and soul of the game.  Do you select your ranged skills for your Highwayman so he can be in position 3?  Or do you take his pos 1/2 skills and play more of a high risk high reward style of play up front?  Do you put your jester in the back making him a buffing character?  Or do you put him further forward so you can apply bleed and be more of a DPS character?  It allows you to make a lot of different parties in different ways, and as you play you learn what combo's works best for each situation, and which ones you prefer to play.  

The enemies also have positions that work differently for each enemy type, and some of your characters will let you manipulate the positions of your enemies to mess them up or put them in a position for one of your other characters to pummel them into the dirt.   So overall the game play is EXCELLENT.

Where I had my struggles with the game was losing characters.  When I first started playing the game it really hurt to lose that Leper that I had been using effectively for so many dives into the dungeon.  I eventually learned that dying is an important aspect of the game, and if you upgrade your stagecoach you will be just fine.  The death of the characters also adds weight to your decisions in the game.  If you decide to get too crazy with a party/skill composition there is a very real chance you are going to lose some of your characters.  So if you decide to play Darkest dungeon just accept right off the bat that death is part of the grim dark theme of the game.

The other aspect of the game that people may not like is the tone and atmosphere of the game.  It is a grim dark themed horror game.  Horror is not really my jam to be honest, but the game play and how the theme is executed, and the great narration of the game drew me in despite my lack of interest in the horror genre.  

Overall the game play is excellent, and the setting, style and art of the game is unique and intriguing.  I would highly recommend this to people looking for a great rogue like dungeon crawler that stands out in an over crowded market. | Ужасный дизбаланс, прокачиваешь одного перса по максимуму, все деньги сливаешь на то чтобы вылечить его грёбаный сифилис, отправить его в бар снять стресс, прокачать ему его боевой навык, а он умирает на очередной вылазке просто из-за того что кто-то из авантюристов сошёл с ума и добил твой танк который был на лолхп потому что такая же обезумевшая весталка отказалась его лечить.

Heat Signature is a case of a game in which the standard stuff that you get shown in the tutorial is and lots of fun by itself (it's hotline miami by way of FTL) but the act of exploiting the game's systems is also both intuitive and wildly effective. The game really clicks when you get on a big ship to assassinate someone, see the 40 people with shields between you and them, and decide instead to go hijack a different ship alltogether to shoot some holes into the former so you can dock right next to your target. Despite the relatively simplistic designs of the procedurally generated ships, there's tons of variety from mission to mission, and I keep discovering new things despite the fact that the game doesn't actually unlock much and progression is just new mission types or getting to buy certain item types instead of having to find them.

Anyway, it's lots of fun, you should play it. | It's good as far as what you get from it. The game progresses by getting more high end gadgets that let you take on enemies who will be invincible otherwise. You can generally classic stealth to a point but enemy contractors will make you play more seat of your pants. There's a few types of missions, and the enjoyment of the game is from going in to a hard mission and trying to win.

Balancing your inventory between weapons and gadgets is part of the game. You pick up a lot of stuff and you need to use it to win.

Understand that this is not a progression quest, the end game isn't that great and if you aren't enjoying it you should stop playing. The actual payoff is the defector missions where you get a bit of cool equipment and try to do a hard mission. i.e, the reward for playing the game is playing the game. | Un exellent jeu au gameplay très riche permettant tout type d'approches aux missions.

I really enjoyed the problem solving, and scenario planning aspect of the game.  It is a ton of fun to play, once you figure it out, and this is where this game falls down, in guiding new players.  

I would highly recommend new players to not shun character guides and other online resources to get going.  This is a ten year old game and I think they purposefully designed the game around ""discovery"" mechanics (especially around character skill progression and item effects) so you learn by doing,  Which I think would be fine if you unlocked something that documented the information for you so if you step away for a few weeks you don't forget.  I find myself wasting resources to ""find out"" what something does only to have forgotten even later in the play through. 

Personally I think if this game underwent a UX/UI cleanup, slightly better tutorialization of some of the mechanics and better information persistance you could re-release this game today and it would attract a huge following. | Addictive, good looking, funny, rogue type game that makes you utilize brain and try it in different play modes.

9/10

Cons - sometimes it is too dependent on random elements. | Simply one of my favorite games of all time. DoTE is a fun little tower defense that can be played solo or with a group (up to four players.) There is quite a few characters to unlock with their own unique play styles and abilities.

Where as “too easy” is well, just that after you get the hang of things, still a fairly good challenge starting out and later on with the different launch pods you unlock after successful playthroughs. FIDS resources are the same as other endless games. If you enjoy resource management and tower defense you should love this. | Не цікава, не весела, цілком порожня гра із високим порогом входження.

I would give 10/10 | After my 3rd attempt, I was able to beat this game, and I didn't really like it. The game is cruel, unreasonably hard and very disrespectful to player. 
At first, the game bombards you with a ton of non-skippable events, missions, messages. While you trying to figure out what's going on, they put on a timer on you with this ""Project Avatar"" thing, and you immediately feel a lot of pressure. Some missions are just crazy difficult, like those for Serpent King and Mad AI factory, and you don't expect this difficulty this early in the game.
Mid-game you finally have a chance to catch some breath and start working on some research, building and engineering, but here's the catch: the moment you get better in the game, the moment you upgrade your weapons and armour, the enemies suddenly become more powerful and armoured. You just don't have a chance to enjoy powerful things that you've made, because they quickly become just what is expected by default.
The end game comes unexpectedly, with a lot of pressure on you. It consists of two consecutive missions with no pause in between. If you got some units damaged in the first mission, you either will have to replace your best units or send them in wounded. The final mission is crazy, the amount of extremely powerful enemies is over the top, and it carries a lot of stress.
Given that the game is flawed with bugs in controls, has dumb battle mechanics that lead to absurd situations and very challenging overall even on lower difficulties, I would not recommend this game. | XCOM2の面白さを語るには、前作にして名作 XCOM: Enemy Unknown (以下XCOM:EU) と比較すると分かりやすいと思う

まず前作のXCOM:EUからあらゆる面で順当に進化しておりボリュームも増した
Steamワークショップ対応でMODも充実と欠点なし！と、損は無いのでセール時にはぜひ買ってプレイしてほしい

以上を大前提とした上で、そう⋯700時間以上もプレイ（最高難易度を最小部隊人数でクリア済）した上で私個人の見解を言わせてもらうと
XCOM:EUよりもゲーム性（ゲームとしての楽しさの意）は落ちてしまったと感じる
XCOM:EUはXCOM2よりも飽きの来る要素が多いはずなのに⋯だ！
※EUでは敵の配置が一部完全固定だったり⋯etc

繰り返し遊ぶゲームとしてみるとXCOM2の方が優秀なはずである
ではなぜ私はXCOM:EUの方がゲーム性が高いと言えるのか？
XCOM:EUのゲーム性はまるでパワプロなのだ
パワプロもメインイベントは決まった日に起こるはずなのに、何度もプレイしても楽しい

XCOM:EUではストーリーの進行と、ミッションが適切な間隔で詰まっており
兵士の計画的な育成（＝ビルドを組む楽しさ）と、時間制限（＝敵の更新／強化）
のバランスがすごい良かったのだ
そしてランダム性が少ないことが→上手くなれば、あらゆる要素を縛っても戦術で勝てる
など良い方向に働いたりした

一方でXCOM2では、多くの追加要素により楽しさも増したが、
その分ストーリーとミッションの関連性が薄れ、またタイムリミット枠の選ばれし者たちの介入は、
戦闘を長引かせる良くない要素の一つだと思う
選ばれし者自体はすごく面白いのだが、3人は多い！ゲームのかさ増しになってしまってる

ストーリーとレジスタンスの尻拭いを交互にやらされるのも間延びする原因だ
XCOM:EUでは助ける国と、見捨てる国の切り分けも緊張感を煽る良いスパイスだった
XCOM:EUでの上手くなるは「ゲームオーバーにならなければ見捨てて/切り捨ててOK」だった
XCOM2では上手くなると「滅亡カウンターがやばくなってきたから、そろそろ助けに行くか～」と、どの難易度でもなった
侵略されてXCOM:EUより悲惨なはずなのに、なんか緊張感にかけるのである
追加要素をプレイさせるために、滅亡までの時間にどうしても猶予が出来てしまったためだ
この点がゲーム性がXCOM:EUより落ちてしまったと感じる部分だ

難易度が上がると、どんどん無駄を減らすプレイングが重要で、駆け抜けるようなゲームプレイ感になるXCOM:EUと
研究や勢力や選ばれし者など、たくさんの要素からどっしり構えて戦略を練っていくXCOM2とプレイ感が違う
そしてたまたまXCOM:EUの方が私に合っていただけなのかも知れない

色々言ったがXCOM2のMODでの拡張性と、それに伴う豊富なキャラクリは本当に最高なので

 | [h1]NO PAIN, NO GAIN: THE GAME[/h1]

[i]Every review is subjective and aligns with the perception, tastes, preferences and/or interests of the person writing it. I’m someone who views video games as another form of artistic expression, which is why I do NOT assign a score, I don't believe art can be measured or quantified, I’ll simply share my personal experience while avoiding spoilers as much as possible.[/i]

This is the third time I've managed to achieve all the achievements/ trophies in this game (GOG and PlayStation were the first two), and my opinion remains unchanged: This game is a work of art, in many aspects, it stands above an average game (whether indie or not): design, music, gameplay, challenge/difficulty, perhaps not so much in the narrative department, on that front, I believe Celeste remains the best, at least among indie games, but even so, it has all the elements to be considered a great game.
The main reason I decided to review it was simple: after finishing it, I began to reflect on what makes Cuphead a great game, of course, this is entirely subjective, as everyone can perceive what makes something good or bad from completely opposite angles and still be right, in my opinion, what influences this perception to a great extent is the fact that Cuphead has never disappointed me, everything it promised from the very beginning was delivered: the old-school cartoon aesthetic, the handcrafted design, the challenge, the soundtrack, and all the other artistic elements, combined with the feeling of satisfaction that comes from mastering the gameplay mechanics, it makes the experience truly unique and genuinely challenging. That being said, I must clarify that it’s not the most difficult indie game I’ve ever played, not even close, that title still belongs to Ghost Song, however, unlike that game, I can play Cuphead for hours and never tire of it, those hours feel like mere seconds, and I believe that’s what makes it a great game, very few titles can evoke in me that sense of timelessness. | Игра очень интересная, но подойдёт далеко не всем, берите, если любите сложности и готовьтесь к тому, что возможно придётся покупать новый геймпад или клавиатуру | Игра хорошая, рисовка отличная, видно что братья старались.В первый час игры было сложно, но прошел игру за три часа, а длс за 8.

[i]Це не просто гра, а справжнє мистецтво двох героїв — Капхеда і Магмена, — яке оживає на екрані. Вона занурює в епоху анімації 30-х років, відтворюючи її настільки ретельно, що важко повірити, що все це працює на Unity. Кожна деталь, кожен кадр намальовані вручну, і ця праця відчувається у всьому.[/i]

Звуковий супровід — присмак шоколаду! [b]Джазові мотиви[/b], записані живим оркестром, ідеально доповнюють стиль гри, створюючи [b]унікальну атмосферу[/b], в якій навіть найскладніші боси здаються частиною якогось шаленого концерту. Саундтрек на повторі після проходження — гарантований. А боси тут родзинкою виступають: вони не лише унікальні візуально, а й змушують гравця [b]боротися за виживання[/b] в хаосі куль, снарядів і несподіваних атак.

[quote=Nice little humor][b][i]“Темні душі інколи тримають бамбук в руках, і не знають як їм далі бути“[/i][/b][/quote]

Сюжет гри простий, але смакує як [b]вишукана кава[/b], і навіть повчальний. Герої потрапили в халепу через азартні ігри й тепер змушені боротися з самим дияволом. Це не просто класична казка про боротьбу добра зі злом, а ще й тонкий натяк на [b]небезпеку бездумних ставок[/b], яку вкрай рідко зустрінеш в сучасних іграх (нещодавно стикнувся з тим, що третина вакансій на мою посаду робочу — це гемблінг, от-ож…)

Технічна сторона гри теж тішить: вона [b]стабільна[/b], [b]оптимізована[/b], і навіть якщо щось піде не так, короткі сесії битв не дадуть гравцеві втратити прогрес. А ще тут купа секретів: приховані маршрути, спеціальні режими, скіни, секретні монетки та навіть альтернативні візуальні ефекти, які додають грі ще більше автентичності, якщо хочеться ще більше!

Я довго спостерігав за Cuphead, але після перегляду стрімів вирішив пройти її в кооперативі з дружиною — і це виявилося [b]неймовірним досвідом[/b]. [b]Разом грати можна[/b], і навіть приємно, головне, щоб хоча б один з вас мав достатній рівень майстерності, щоб витягнути команду через всі ці морквяні бої, літачки, навіжених котів та зустрічей з джинами та іншими -инами.

Але! Купуйте тільки [b]якщо маєте [/b]здорову[b] нервову систему[/b] та нічого ніде не щемить. Тоді і [b]спробуєте підкорити[/b] цю чашковершину."

Did not seem to be much of an effort put in to this game.

Instead of helping people, it makes you want to turn the game off.
Depression isn't just about one thing. Like an onion there are many layers to depression.
The game seemed to deal vary basic ideas of depression.

Don't take my word for it, and check out my video by clicking on the link.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbpN59h4qfg | This game really highlighted for me what my experience with depression has been like. The option to see a therapist and take anti-depressants and talk to people was a cathartic experience that makes me believe that it can get better for me. There's a way out of this if I talk to people, and I just arranged for myself to get therapy for this. Thank you for making this, I definitely recommend if you want to get an insight into what living with depression is like. | É muito bom quando nós, jogadores nos identificamos com um game. Pessoalmente, é um dos sentimentos que mais busco quando jogo, seja ele qual for, quando parece nos ""transcrever"" para a história. Ou ainda mais comum, aqueles com história tão boa que parece que fazemos parte do enredo.
Agora, é complicado, demais, quando você se identifica demais com o jogo o suficiente para achar que parte dele, ao menos, fizeram sobre você.

Começando da base: os controles, extremamente simples, apesar de atalhos de teclado ou controle de Xbox ou qualquer que seja qual se use, o mouse ainda é a melhor opção, pois é um game que não requer muito trabalho de movimentação.

Ao enredo: é de leitura, storytelling, narrativo. E isso é claro, um dos pontos principais, já que isso requer preferência do jogador. É baseado em apenas leitura, então ainda assim, requer um pouco de paciência, pois é longo. A minha primeira jogada levou mais de uma hora.

Segundo ponto forte e como o nome sugere, o tema é Depressão. É um jogo... Informativo sobre a doença. Remete à doença, no cotidiano.

É um jogo forte sim, psicologicamente. E é um desses games que parece que fizeram sobre nós. Aos mais sensíveis, é triste e choroso, e volto a repetir: forte.
Pessoalmente não cabe a mim dizer que é uma jogada obrigatória. É a livre-arbítrio quem queira testar, mas quem sabe o que é a doença, ou sofre com Ansiedade ou Pânico, vai levar ao lado extremamente pessoal, como foi o meu caso. E mexe mesmo.

DQ em termos de game, foi bem estrtuturado, mesmo tão simples. A trilha colabora muito com o que transmite de sentimentos. Não é linear, caso haja dúvida, mas a melhor recomendação é jogar diante do que você sente ao ler a narração ou ao se por no lugar do dito personagem.

Enfim, levando em conta que o jogo em si se considera uma ""não"" ficção, embora seja uma, em termos de enredo, tem um drama bastante presente. Mas levando a consideração que mexe com o real, não dá para se ler ""um drama"" nessa história, pois Depressão (e afins) não é(são) um drama, é sério e não se pode ser ridicularizado.

Considerando ficcional: 10/10 para mim. Agora, é pesado considerando o real. | All this is is a question and answer session that you complete to determine how depressed you are it's pointless. If I could package siphilis in a box and sell it this is the worst product ever.

Right up there or better than Rome Total War, Age of Empires, Age of Mythology.  9.5/10. I thoroughly enjoyed AOW2 as well growing up with my dad and brother. And for AOW3 thank goodness it had a bit of a story mode too. Not that I needed an expansive one, but it really helped me learn the nuances of the game (which is why I just couldn't get into AOW4 due to their LACK of any story mode).

 | Игра имба но не пойму как поиграть в онлайн с друзьями высвечивает какая то ошибка failed to acquire valid pings gang beasts | Gang Beasts is the definition of chaotic fun. Developed by Boneloaf, this multiplayer brawler combines slapstick humor with ridiculous physics, delivering a party game experience unlike any other. Whether you're battling friends on a collapsing Ferris wheel or struggling to throw your opponents off a speeding truck, Gang Beasts guarantees uncontrollable laughter and unforgettable moments.

Simple Yet Brilliant Gameplay
The beauty of Gang Beasts lies in its simplicity. The controls are easy to grasp but difficult to master, leading to hilariously clumsy battles. You punch, grab, headbutt, and grapple your way to victory, but the wobbly, gelatinous characters make every movement unpredictable. It’s like watching a slapstick comedy sketch play out in real time, and it never gets old.

Unpredictable Physics
Gang Beasts’ physics engine is both your best friend and worst enemy. Characters flail, stumble, and collapse in the most absurd ways, turning even the simplest confrontations into laugh-out-loud spectacles. It’s this unpredictability that keeps the game fresh, as no two battles ever play out the same way.

Creative and Hazardous Arenas
The arenas are just as much a part of the chaos as the characters themselves. From fighting on a precarious billboard to brawling in a meat grinder, each level is filled with environmental hazards that can instantly change the tide of battle. The dynamic stages add layers of strategy (and hilarity) as you dodge obstacles while simultaneously trying to toss your friends to their doom.

Multiplayer Madness
Gang Beasts is built for multiplayer madness. Whether you’re playing locally with friends or battling online opponents, the game shines in its social interactions. The sheer unpredictability leads to shouting, laughing, and shouting some more. It’s the perfect party game that never fails to get people out of their seats.

Charming Art Style and Sound Design
The colorful, cartoonish art style perfectly complements the game’s lighthearted nature. The floppy, dough-like characters are ridiculously adorable, making it even funnier when they’re punching each other senseless. The sound design adds to the humor, with satisfying thuds, grunts, and the occasional scream as characters are flung off buildings.

Endless Replayability
Gang Beasts thrives on its replayability. Thanks to the dynamic physics, no two matches are alike. It’s the kind of game you can revisit time and time again, especially when you have friends around. Whether you're playing competitively or just fooling around, the game consistently delivers hours of entertainment.

Conclusion
Gang Beasts is a masterpiece of multiplayer mayhem. Its blend of slapstick humor, wobbly physics, and chaotic arenas makes for an experience that’s as frustrating as it is fun—in the best way possible. It’s a game that doesn’t take itself too seriously, and that’s precisely what makes it so lovable.

If you’re looking for a party game that guarantees laughter and chaos, look no further. Gang Beasts is a must-have.

76561198041304371,288160,The Room,2.816666666666667,"Adventure, Indie",5,"The Room is a puzzle game where you solve a series of intricate puzzle boxes to uncover the secret of A.S., the person who called you to solve them.

The gameplay here is pretty simple: you just solve puzzles. Each stage, you're given one puzzle box, and you have to click around to figure out how each part opens or moves. The puzzles weren't very difficult. The only times I got a little bit stuck were because it wasn't clear that something was movable. There were a few puzzle types that were repeated once or twice, but it didn't happen enough to bore me by the end. 

The Room doesn't have a very developed story, but it is very atmospheric. What story you get comes in the form of notes from A.S., which give you some insight into what they were researching. The game has a mysterious vibe to it that gets creepier as you get further into the levels, from the increasing strangeness of the notes, the changing details of the room around you, and the odd noises mixed in with the background music.

This game was originally a mobile game and the movements you have to make were clearly designed with a touch interface in mind. You have to turn keys and cranks and pull up on lids. You also have to move the camera around to see the puzzle boxes from all sides or to line elements up a certain way for some of the puzzles. I played on a computer with a mouse, so some of those movements felt a little awkward. It was also a little annoying to have to adjust the camera so much to see certain things straight on.

Overall, I liked The Room. While the puzzles weren't difficult, I wasn't bored with them, and I enjoyed the creepy atmosphere. Although it was a bit short, I felt like I got a decent value out of the game, and I'm really curious to see what the rest of the series will have to offer. 7/10 | El juego es entretenido, sin embargo algo raro es que dentro de sus archivos se encuentra un archivo ""browscap.ini"" que se usa para identificar navegadores y bots web.

Half Life 2 is one of the best games ever made didn't feature a minimap or any hand holding or any waypoints showing you where to go and it had AI that was fucking ruthless against you.

76561198041304371,291410,Duelyst,0.23333333333333334,"Free To Play, Indie, Strategy",0,"When it comes to Duelyst, the comparison with Hearthstone is easily made. The way you earn cards is the same, the ranked system is the same, the mana system is the same and the way classes work is the same, complete with special power.

However, there's a few very key differences between the two games that make Duelyst less random and, to me at least, more fun: The board on which you play as well as the ability to replace a card from your hand once per turn.

The board in combination with the various cards makes for some really deep and satisfying tactical play that allows you to bend the game to your favour with smart decisions. Every turn the board looks different as there's so much going on and every turn has a very large amount of decisions that you can make. I really enjoy this the most as a fervent tactical turn-based gamer. If you like the combat in XCOM and Age of Wonders 3, you will find lots to love here.

Other plusses are the quick matchmaking, the active developers, the gorgeous pixel art and animations and the large amount of interesting lore.

I am personally not a fan of random stuff (which is why I stopped playing Hearthstone) and to me Duelyst strikes the perfect balance between randomness and tactics. Highly recommended! | Abosultely love this game! The strategy needed due to the infinite possibilities between the game board, placement of ""cards"", and of course the kick @$$ pixel graphics!!  A very satisfying game that could easily be played and enjoyed without spending a penny of ""real money"".  The daily quests (and free card) can get you enough gold to buy spirit orbs (card packs), gauntlet tickets (arena/draft play) and bloodborn orbs (card packs with cards you DONT have!).  Yes, if you get a crate you need a key to open it which costs $4.99.. BUT they did recently implement a ""common crate"" key reward for 15 quests completed in a month (easy).  However, if you are worried that you will be missing out on items due to not wanting to buy crates they are mostly filled with cosmetic items with 1 card here and there so they are not required to complete your card collection. The last thing I want to touch on, which is one of my favorites, is the fact that each ""faction"" or class does not only have 1 type of general that has the same hero power no matter the skin or avatar.  There are multiple general (main hero/""face"") options for each faction AND your general always has at least 2 attack and can  move around the board like a chess piece, the same as your minions, instead of just being your avatar with a set power that never moves or defends themself without a weapon equipped.

To get the FULL experience and really find out I suggest you JUST PLAY IT.  Nothing to lose since it is F2P, the system requirements are low, and if you want to get a free spirit orb (or just 100 gold) use my referral code ""gdaddanyt"" and friend me to play some matches!! :) | i like the art work and you can't complain about the gameplay really. sure there are some people with awesome cards or decks, but its all about the strategy. it makes you think and it doesnt get boring. if it does, you can always come back to it later and appreciate the workers who put effort into making this game awesome. | Please support Chinese

像素风刚刚开始还是有点难接受，毕竟看惯了3D画面，再改回来有点不习惯。不过深入去玩以后就会发现还是比较不错的，像素风也不是那么难以接受了。
相比于炉石，duelyst加入了战棋的要素，而且大大减少了随机性，让“有实力”的玩家可以真正靠自己的头脑走向胜利（炉石的导演实在是……），缺点就是上手比较难吧，我自己也摸索了好一阵才堪堪入门。
由于抽到了核弹，我一直走cass的套路，萝莉还是挺强的2333。这游戏的橙卡不难抽，做起来也不贵，作为一个炉石退坑玩家，游戏王养老玩家，万智牌新手玩家，我还是比较推荐这款游戏的。"

然而，问题不仅仅这么简单，这么优秀的游戏却有着一群跟我们思维构造不同的GM和MOD，他们在没有事先通知的情况下封了几乎所有参加过PVP的人，而且时间有的多达30天甚至是365天，经常玩这个游戏热爱这个游戏每天游戏时间足够长的所有国人无一幸免，而且申诉机制异常奇怪，真正该封禁的人被解封了，无辜群众反而被关在了里面，据一些因为玩游戏频率不高而侥幸逃过一劫的国人反应，本来偏小众的游戏的在线人数进一步减少，本来一场联赛平时1分钟以内就一定能排到对手现在却排了四五分钟都无法匹配成功，游玩人数大量减少，玩家纷纷弃坑，然而面对这种结果，GM和MOD却仍然表示满意，绝对自己做得很是正确。另外，由于这个游戏是人治，所以管理上有明显的偏袒，和mod关系好的人不会被封禁然而其余人很容易被封禁，据少数国人反应，游戏内可能有一定反华倾向，在世界打字中文会收获到举报，总之你一定要做好随时被封禁的心理准备即使你只是正常的老老实实的玩游戏。一次封禁很有可能直接抹消掉你之前的时间和金钱投入，所以，即使这个游戏很有趣，但大家入坑前还是要慎重，即使决定了入坑，购买付费内容的时候还是要慎重，毕竟，他们封禁你的时候不会在乎你花了几百几千人民币的。 | Pros:  I was transported back in time 30 years, the flavor and feel of PnP RPG gaming is perfect.  The metagame story is fun and interesting.  Felt like the 1980s...

Cons:  The micropayment cash grab is gross.  You can play free for @30hrs, then you need to start buying access.
Also: this game is a _very cheap_ strat game, with minimalist card building elements.

If you want to feel the nostalgia - play for free.  Any other reason should be a pass.

I give it a thumbs up BARELY and only for the story and feels.  The game is a grind - barely entertaining. | 平时网好的时候用网页版，方便。只有网不好才用客户端，所以看起来游戏时间很少。

关于有一些大佬说的大规模封号的事件，应该说是大家都有错，但是官方确实没有一碗水端平。特别是在 [h1][i]传说之夜[/i][/h1] 那天，一群外国人滥用游戏机制封掉了一个大佬的号，这个举动寒了国内玩家心，所以才会有两篇4000小时的差评。现在快两年过去了，走了很多人也改了一些规则，游戏也慢慢地平静了下来，事情大概也能盖棺定论了。平心而论，这个游戏还是瑕不掩瑜，值得大家尝试，欢迎大家进群玩耍。

The mechanic of picking things up and throwing them doesn't really interest me, and getting procedurally screwed over wasn't so much a challenge that made me go, ""Ah, I bet I can overcome this with better prep!"" as it was, ""Damn, I can't get this puzzle to a solution without dying because I was too unlucky."" It's one thing in roguelikes if I die because I made a mistake, but in this one, I sometimes died just because there was a puzzle that needed large shrubbery pieces from a room two screens away, and there was a black ghost between, and trying to get the giant shrubbery to the right place became so tedious...

Crawl is an incredibly fun and unique game! I love the dynamic gameplay and the competitive element between players.

I really wish the developers would continue adding new content or even make a sequel! 🔥🎮 | This game is great. The music is great, the graphics are great, the competitive nature makes it brutal for parties. I have never played this game single-player, but it's a blast with friends.

Muito Bom para jogar com amigos (e sozinho as vezes) para passar o tempo, a Pixel Arte é bonita porém pode te deixar muito confuso as vezes, a gameplay é simples porém legal, só acho que falta um pouco mais de conteúdo no jogo, como outros modos de jogo, mais monstros, mais bosses e etc. Mas o jogo é divertido recomendo que teste, talvez você e seus amigos gostem."

Não jogo RPG, mas esse jogo me deixou muito confortável e apresentou uma jogabilidade tranquila com exploração e combates desafiadores na medida certa até para quem não é familiarizado com o estilo de jogo, uma experiência marcante. História bonita com personagens cativantes, artes potentes, trilha sonora especial. Nota: 10/10 | Art style and OST are both beautiful. The rhyming dialogue is really unique and I enjoyed the turn based combat. Would recommend. | Child of Light non si può definire un Indie, dato che ha dietro il colosso Ubisoft, ma nonostante ciò il gioco mantiene una certa aria indipendente, sostenuta da uno dei comparti grafici più curati di sempre. Ma forse è prima necessario parlare di alcune cose per capire Child.
Siamo nel 2025, l'industria è cambiata. Le aziende sono cambiate, in meglio? in peggio? in mostri assetati di denaro e informazioni?. Non c'è una risposta giusta, tutte sono altrettanto valide e sopratutto sapere che quest'anno viene dopo il 2024 che per molte devs è stato un punto di rottura bello grosso, spaventa ben bene. La stessa Ubisoft ha collezionato insuccessi dopo l'altro, 
la fiducia è ai minimi storici, l'azienda sembra vivere in mondo la colpa è dei giocatori (spoiler è anche vero, sopratutto se pensiamo ai due bellissimi Prince of Persia usciti, due perle certamente) e mai sua e delle sue strategie (anche te dirigente ubisoft, mettere le uscite dei Prince of Persia così vicine, le politiche sugli NFT, le scelte scellerate sui costi delle varie edizioni e la stessa monetizzazione, non avrebbero generato una situazione come questa?REALLY?!).
Scavando nel catalogo della compagnia, però di diamanti splendenti c'è ne sono. Simboli che la voglia di fare giochi c'è e ci sarà, e che sarebbe meglio seguire quella piuttosto che le mode (anche qui 10 battle royale sviluppati in sviluppo al tempo del COVID, quante ne sono usciti? hyper Scape che è fallito dopo pochi mesi per problemi strutturali e lo scarso supporto dietro).
In Child of Light c'è un'inaspettata sensibilità in ogni campo, dalla musicale della bravissima Béatrice Martin, alla poesia della trama e dei personaggi  in una storia che ricorda le fiabe nord europee di una volta. Non per forza dei Grimm, ma di tutta quella tradizione delle fiabe, ma se siete incuriositi ma non volete sapere troppo:
La Regina Nera ha rubato il Sole, la Luna e le Stelle. Noi siamo Aurora, una giovane principessa dal cuore puro la cui anima ha raggiunto il magico regno di Lemuria, siamo deboli all'inizio e oltre a noi c'è Noctis. La nostra missione sarà recuperare le tre sorgenti di luce, sconfiggere la Regina Nera e salvare il regno e i suoi abitanti. ovviamene non saremo da soli.
Child è un RPG open world dagli scontri a metà tra il tempo reale e i turni stile JRPG, ma spiegarlo è molto riduttivo. Durante gli scontri, grazie alla semplice idea di rendere visibile l'ordine di attacco in formato ""timeline"" e permetterci di variare in tempo reale la posizione dei contendenti su di essa tramite meccanismi (gestibili persino con un secondo controller!), il gioco non ci fa addormentare mentre aspettiamo il nostro turno, ma aggiunge pepe e costringe a restare vigili in ogni momento. Anche perchè ogni colpo, ogni magia, ogni pozione a una sua durata. se troppo lunga veniamo scavalcati dalle altre mosse e se invece ne abbiamo una breve, possiamo anche far scattare all'indietro i nostri avversari o addirittura lanciare stati alterati per renderci immuni per un tot. ll sistema funziona davvero davvero bene, complice anche il sistema dei nemici è ad Elementi (Acqua>Fuoco>Pietra>Fulmine>Acqua), con l'aggiunta della Luce che viene sfruttata per le creature oscure (nota personale, gli attacchi di luce mi hanno ricordato quelli degli Angeli in Evangelion, sarà voluto o meno? io adoro.).
Per migliorare i propri dati, oltre al classico level-up e l'acquisizione di capacità ad albero, viene utilizzata una fusione tra cristalli indossabili (gli Oculi) e piccole stelle (Stardust) nascoste per la mappa. Da non sottavalutare la difficoltà, a livello facile serve una buona di strategia e preparazione, a livello normale ancora di più. I molti segreti, la possibilità d'inventarsi strategie avanzate (indispensabili a difficoltà Normale appunto), e l'agile scambio tra personaggi, incorniciano un game design intelligente come pochi altri. Poi vogliamo parlare di come in inglese parlano tutti in rimane? in italiano la traduzione non è perfetta ma non importa  è una meraviglia anche da ascoltare per quel poco che c'è di doppiaggio e le traduzioni svolgono egregiamente il senso di immergerti e avvolgerti
Unico neo? Per giocarlo serve Uplay, che diciamolo subito così come molti altri client secondari, non serve a nulla.  
Per concludere che ormai sto scrivendo un saggio, più che una recensione, io nn so quale futuro attende Ubisoft o anche l'intera industria, ma so almeno che se Ubisoft voglia recuperare tanto di quel terreno perduto, di tornare ad essere davvero quel colosso che è stata, non deve lanciarsi in una folle corsa. Ma solo guardare al suo passato e... smetterla con le cripto, non far pagare un gioco 80 euro per poi renderlo giocabile mesi e mesi dopo e sopratutto. Basta uscite annuali per le sue serie,
servirà a qualcosa questo strana recensione? chi può dirlo, viviamo in tempi unici del resto. | 很好玩的回合制。画风，游戏性，都无可指摘。 | O jogo falhará na inicialização se você tiver mais de 8 núcleos.

Felizmente, existem maneiras de fazer o aplicativo pensar que você tem menos núcleos. Aqui está como eu fiz isso.

1. Obtenha o Kit de Avaliação e Implantação (Windows ADK)

Você pode encontrá-lo aqui: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install

Quando você instala, a única coisa que você precisa é o Administrador de Compatibilidade (32-bit) ferramenta. Você pode desmarcar tudo o resto do instalador.

2. Configure o ChildOfLight.exe para usar veja um máximo de 16 núcleos

- Inicie o Administrador de Compatibilidade (32-bit). Ele criará um novo ""Banco de Dados Personalizado"" chamado ""Novo Banco de Dados"". Clique com o botão direito e renomeie-o para outra coisa, ex. ""Correções de jogos""
- Clique em ""Salvar"" e dê um nome ao arquivo de banco de dados, ex. ""Correções de jogos"". Salvei o meu na raiz da minha pasta SteamLibrary.
- Selecione seu banco de dados renomeado, clique em ""Corrigir""
- Ele vai pedir nome e fornecedor, esta parte não importa, eu usei ""Child of Light"" e ""Ubisoft"". Procure o seu ChildofLight.exe na sua biblioteca de vapor (SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Child of Light\ChildofLight.exe)
- Clique em Avançar - ignore os ""Modos de Compatibilidade""
- Clique em Avançar novamente, agora você poderá encontrar ""Correções de compatibilidade""

Você deseja verificar e configurar estes dois:

- Localizar ""ProcessorCountLie""; Clique na caixa de seleção; Abra ""Parâmetros"" e defina o valor ""Linha de comando"" como 16
- Encontre ""ProcessorCountLieForHybridCPU ""; Clique na caixa de seleção; abra ""Parâmetros"" e defina o valor ""Linha de comando"" como 16

- Clique em Avançar;
- Clique em ""Gerar automaticamente""
- Clique em Concluir

3. Instale sua correção
Clique com o botão direito do mouse no banco de dados e escolha ""Instalar""

4. Lançar o jogo
O jogo deve agora ser capaz de iniciar (a partir do vapor ou do .exe) corretamente.

Boa sorte!"

This was *the* game of my youth, and diving back into it with updated graphics is like reuniting with an old friend who looks even better than you remember.  

The gameplay is as magical as ever—exploring the map, planning your strategies, and building your perfect army is just as thrilling now as it was back then. Every turn feels like a little puzzle, and I still get that same rush when I finally capture a key town or outsmart an opponent in battle.  

The updated visuals are a nice touch. Seeing the towns and units in high definition made me appreciate how much detail the original game had. It’s not a complete remake, but it’s faithful to the charm and spirit of the classic, and that’s what matters most to me.  

Sure, it doesn’t include the expansions, and I wish it did, but even the base game has so much to offer. Whether you’re revisiting it like me or trying it for the first time, there’s a reason this game is a legend in the strategy genre.

Очень любил эту игру до того,как разработчики испортили её.Раньше все старались построить хорошие машины,выбрать те оружия,которые им по душе.Были Тиры,и каждый Тир был сбалансирован,не было через чур(были,но немного) сильный противников.Было Древо улучшений.А сейчас - разнацветные кубики,пыль,кейсы,игроки строят коробки на одной ножке или коробки с ротором и цепляют на него самые имбалансные пушки,которые выпали из купленных кейсов.Подбор противников просто ужасен.Игру облегчили для максимума(чтобы любой идиот,у которого есть деньги мог играть в это и донатить как можно больше) и превратили в помойку.Раньше было намного лучше.Разработчикам важен только донат,а не сама игра. | Uwaga! Opis mechanik gry jest już przestarzały(wyjaśnienie na końcu);

Dobry przykład jak ze świetnej gry zrobić totalnego gniota bez balansu nastawionego na grind i mikrotranzakcje wymuszające kupno premium by mieć jakąkolwiek szansę normalnego rozwoju konta. Gra kilka lat temu była świetna, przyjemny rozwój robotów, przyjemne walki, gra była nastawiona na umiejętności budowy robotów, co było bardzo ważną umiejętnością, a walka polegała na starannym niszczeniu najsłabszych punktów przeciwnika. Było trochę problemów z balansem, ale twórcy kompletnie nie potrafili ich naprawić mimo tego, że gracze pisali wielokrotnie co trzeba zmienić.

Twórcy wszystkie problemy zaczęli ""rozwiązywać"" od najgorszej strony, tworząc przy okazji nowe problemy. Z czasem gra straciła jakikolwiek sens posiadania umiejętności budowy, ponieważ teraz często liczy się kto pierwszy zaatakuje, a nie skill. Tutaj już nawet nie trzeba budować, twórcy dali możliwość kupowania robotów innych graczy, przez co nie ma sensu się starać, lepiej kupić potężnego bota aktualnej mety, po co budować, skoro wszystko i tak będzie gorsze? Tu też przychodzi drugi problem, balans. Zawsze był z tym problem, lecz kiedyś nie aż tak duży. Jak zwykle twórcy nie potrafią rozwiązywać problemów, przez to w grze jest pewna tzw. ""meta"", czyli najskuteczniejsze boty w grze. Przez idotyczne decyzje twórców ta liczba w tej chwili wynosi bodajże 3(tak, 3 typy robotów są skutecznie na wyższym poziomie umiejętności, reszta to strata nerwów i przegrywanie). Mobilność bota jest wszystkim ponieważ nawet najtwardsze boty topnieją w chwilę, więc nie ma sensu budować niczego innego. Chcesz pobawić się tworząc ładnie wyglądającego bota? Zapomnij, chyba, że nie masz nic przeciwko przegrywaniu 3/4 gier. Twórcy nie potrafią rozwiązać jakichkolwiek problemów z balansem. Do tego doszedł system skrzynek, który polega po prostu na tym, że gigantycznie zmniejszył średnią zdobywaną kasę za bitwę oraz zachęca do kupowania premium w postaci ""patrz, super rzadki item, kup premium to go dostaniesz!"". Bitwa za bitwą a zbudować to, co przedtem mogliśmy po ~30 bitwach teraz musimy zagrać ich ~200. Chyba, że ma się farta i się wydropi legendarny przedmiot. Ewentualnie gra pokaże go w slocie premium i będzie chciała zachęcić do jego kupna. Recykling bezużytecznych itemów na kasę w grze daje idiotycznie małe wartosci, prawie nic, gracze domagali się podniesienia wartości recyklingu, po wielu miesiącach, twórcy w końcu zrobili to, ale tylko, kiedy ma się premium(!), powodując, że teraz premium nie tylko dwukrotnie zwiększa ilośc itemów ze skrzynek, to teraz trzykrotnie zwiększa wartość recyklingu każdego itema. p2w tego nie można do końca nazwać, ale definitywnie jest to PayWall. Aktualne premium powoduje, że otrzymamy tyle, ile przed updatem zanim zmniejszyli nagrody za bitwy. Grając za darmo otrzymujemy 6x mniej. Powodzenia zbudować bota z ulubionym wyposażeniem. Gra bez premium to katorga, W dodatku gra jest wieczną alfą, co służy tylko temu, by twórcy mogli sobie dowoli zmieniać so chcą, np. jeszcze bardziej zwiększając rolę mikropłatności w grze. W rzeczywistości gra jest w gorszym stanie niż 2,5 lat temu. Kilka miesięcy temu było baardzo źle i weterani uciekali od tego szajsu. Teraz jest jeszcze gorzej.

Podsumowując: Stuprocentowy negatyw.

@edit 24.05.2019 r.
Sporo się zmieniło, nie ma już lootboxów, powrócili (nieudolnie) do tierów oraz drzewka technologii. Gra jest nadal masakryczna. Fizyka skopana, najlepsze roboty to pojedyncza broń T5 na lekkim i szybkim(najlepiej latającym) bocie. ""Connecting To Server"" wszędzie, a w dodatku by zniwelować ubytek graczy nie można już wybrać trybu gry z rotacją co godzinę. Tak. Ta sama mapa, ten sam tryb, te same ustawienia PRZEZ GODZINĘ. Dodali ulepszanie broni(by zadawały jeszcze więcej DMG!), więc TTK jeszcze bardziej zmniejszyli(za czasów Overclockingu ludzie nienawidzili buffowania DMG, widać twórcy nic się nie nauczyli). Robopassy dające jakieś kiepskie kosmetyczne przedmioty by trochę kasy wyciągnąć z umierającej gry.
Od Grudnia 2018 r. stracili połowę istniejących graczy. Jak to zrobili? Pośrednio twórcy w końcu zobaczyli, że Robocraft z początków był lepszy, więc próbują wprowadzać rzeczy i mechanikę, która była w tamtym czasie. Problem jest taki, że po pierwsze robią to nieumiejętnie, po drugie, że nadal próbują swoje ""nowości"". Na końcu otrzymujemy dziadostwo, w które nie da się grać. W tą grę gra mniej ludzi niż w Spore. I pomyśleć, że Robocraft ze swoją unikalną receptą na grę posiadał ponad 7 tysięcy aktywnych graczy.

Jakiś czas temu wyszli z Early Access, a przynajmniej zrobili to teoretycznie, bo gra nadal się zmieniała drastycznie. W sumie gra jest w gorszym stanie niż w czasie wczesnego EA.

@Edit, 14.07.2019.
No i stało się. Robocraft upadł. Freejam zwalnia ludzi bo mają mało kasy, przyznali się, że Robocraft po opłaceniu serwerów wychodzi na minus. Wszystkie zasoby idą na RobocraftX(tworzenie gry od początku). Będą utrzymywać serwery tak długo jak to będzie możliwe i naprawiać większe bugi. Kilka lat ludzie pisali co jest źle z grą, mówili jakie błędy popełniają twórcy, wszystko dostali na tacy, twórcy mieli to gdzieś i dalej rozwalali grę po swoją tajemniczą ""wizję"", która się zmieniała co update dalej rozwalając grę dziwnymi rozwiązaniami, o które nikt nie prosił. To się nie mogło inaczej skończyć Radzę nie wydawać nawet grosza na tą grę, bo pieniądze mogą przepaść. | Encontre este juego hace unos años atras. Encontre un potencial exito indie multiplayer, como por ejemplo lo que hoydia es Rocket League.
Me enamore de sus mecanicas, y del desarrollo que Freejam de entregaba a su juego, sin duda yo me alegre bastante cuando Robocraft gano el Indie del Año por parte de IndieDB.

Era esos dias en donde era una Arena 10vs10, donde llegar a Tier 10 te hacia en uno de los mejores del juego. En donde tenias que ser consistente para ir desbloqueando todas las mejoras del arbol de tecnologias. En donde la sinergia del jugador y su maquina, y lo mas importante y lo que actualmente se perdio: completo trabajo en equipo. Y quien llevaba a nivel 100 era considerado un Dios.

Donde la habilidad era para saber construir el mejor vehiculo, en todos los ambitos posibles. En donde se copiaban diseños pero aun asi quedaban con un toque personal.

Esos dias. Antes de las torres. Antes de los Megabots. Antes de los medicos.
Cuando solo habian 3 clases. Y aun asi digo que la inclusion de los medicos dio un giro muy positivo al juego.

Donde TODOS. Iban en una fila por una de las 2 lineas principales del mapa. Y en donde se producia un 50/50 en donde podia quedar la absoluta mie*da en una batalla de 10vs10 frente a frente. Y en donde el equipo contrario llegaria a su base y el equipo de dividia para ir a defender la base.

Updates pasaban y no habia tanto cambio. Incluso la inclusion de las torres era una idea fantastica, y todo el mundo en los foros dio su apoyo. Pero simplemente y en mera opinion mia, no fue ejecutada de manera efectiva, o sonaba mejor en papel. Aun asi el juego era bastante bueno en esos momentos y todavia se apreciaba ese espiritu competitivo. Lo que realmente afecto al juego fue el sistema de respawn. Antes la gente hacia cosas imposibles para sobrevivir. O intentar capturar la base enemiga. Con el respawn vi morir frente a mi todo eso.

Hasta que 2 mecanicas nuevas mataron mi idea original del juego.
Las cajas y el nuevo sistema de ""dinero"".

Incluso yo estaba a favor de perder dinero por reparar el vehiculo cada vez que perdias. Y ahora hasta puedes comprar vehiculos prefabricados.
Seguramente si el juego hubiera ido por buen camino, ahora mismo estaría jugando competitivamente en un clan.

Pero lamentablemente soñar no cuesta nada. Intentar arreglar la dignidad de este juego, mucho.

EDIT:

Me han llegado comentarios que estoy tirando mie*da al juego solamente porque soy (""fui"") ""manco"". Los estoy borrando porque la verdad no demuestran nada objetivo.

This was one of my favorite games back in 2014. It had everything you could ask for: balancing, a good community, active and attentive devs, weapons that complemented each other, fun gameplay, good progression, lack of ""pay2win"" and so forth. Needless to say, it was awesome.

Then the January 2015 update was released.

The January 2015 update added a new gamemode where you destroy towers, levelled up, and respawn if destroyed. Initially, me and the rest of the community thought ""Cool."" and waited to see what else was in store. Little did I know that the downfall of Robocraft had begun.

(Order not completely accurate)

""Megabots"" (gigantic robots basically) were removed as soon as the update came out, if not before.

Crates were introduced (partially replacing the robits system), level based CPU limits eliminated, and the tech tree removed, eliminating progression, reducing creativity, and generally made the game much worse. Despite the huge outcry and the veterans and other players who started to leave the game, the devs simply ignored the community and moved on.

Helicopter blades were added, enabling people to make flying fortresses (maybe literrally). Personally I don't think much of this.

Then weapons, most notably an anti-air cannon and a minigun, were added, making weapons unbalanced and the game more frustrating to play. As a pilot in Robocraft (a more ""traditional"" one who used plasma bombers), this particulary saddened and angered me.

A robot shop was added, further reducing creativity.

An intro was added into the game, giving the game a more ""cheezy"" feel and making it seem as if the developers were copying other games. By this point, I personally felt that the developers were catering more toward children (12 year olds) and no longer valued older players and veterans.

All this time, veterans and other older players were leaving the game as it became increasingly apparent that the developers were not listening to the community. 

A new chat system was added, featuring a clan system that the community had been asking for for a long time. This was not nearly enough however, as the other changes above (as well as others) and the careless developers made the game unenjoyable for me (and potentially other older players, although I can not speak for them on this matter).

I finally left Robocraft for good in mid 2015 (shortly after the new chat system was introduced) after a brief stint operating a hovercraft with SMGs.

In it's current state, Robocraft is unbalanced and unenjoyable. The developers are careless and possibly largely inactive (aside from bugfixes and tweaks). Gameplay is frustrating, gamemodes horrible. 

As another reviewer (spynathan) has said: ""From Robocraft to Robocrap.""

If, somehow, all (and I mean all) changes to the game were reverted back to sometime before the January 2015 update, say, November 2014, me and other members of the community (read their reviews to see what they have to say) who have left Robocraft may very well return.

Until then, goodbye Robocraft. | 看我的游戏时间就知道了。这确实是一个好游戏，我还买了永久会员，但他现在确实让我失望了。我也是从T级时代走过来的人，RC的变化我也历历在目。不过现在，FJ的小霸王服务器，将游戏改的一塌糊涂，各种毒瘤载具对新手的压制，虽然出了简体中文，玩家也更多了，但为什么RC的评价在从好评如潮下滑到褒贬不一呢？我们应该思考，FJ更应该思考。"

Германия в окружении, сражается из последних сил. Союзники с запада и Красная армия на востоке продолжают сжимать кольцо окружения Германии.

[h2]Сюжет:[/h2]
Элитный снайпер Карл Фейберн отправляется на своё последнее задание во Второй мировой войне-ликвидировать немецких учёных, разработавших ракеты Фау-2 (V2) и не допустить их запуск на Лондон, паралельно с этим, не дать учёным перейти на сторону русских.

[h2]Геймплей:[/h2]
Казалось бы, играешь за обычного снайпера. Бери винтовку, целься, стреляй. Однако, стоит поставить высокую сложность, как игра тут же преображается. Необходимо учитывать дыхание, сердцебиение; направление ветра, влияющее на полёт пули, также следует целится выше, т.к траектория пули снижается при полёте. Уровни здесь линейные, но имеющие множество путей прохождения. Можно сворачивать шеи врагам сзади, можно бесшумно стрелять из велрода. Отвлечь врага камнем, ставить ловушки, растяжки, мины для тяжёлой техники. Пользуясь шумом, можно замаскировать выстрел из снайперской винтовки. Главной фишкой всей серии Sniper Elite - это рентген-камера во время убийства; с каждой последующей частью она становилась лучше, масштабнее и эпичнее. Можно попасть в глаз, сердце, любую кость, а также в пах (да, Адольф?).

[h2]Музыка:[/h2]
Чего только стоит эпичный саундтрек, написанный композитором Марком Ратерфордом. Эти мелодии, одновременно отдающие дух неизбежного поражения Германии, так и приближения новой войны. Ну как же не упомянуть главную тему игры под названием ""Fatherland"", придающая крутости и брутальности всей франшизе.

Есть корпоративный режим ""Двойка"", где один игрок играет за снайпера и прикрывает наводчика. Сам наводчик в свою очередь выполняет диверсионные действия.

[h2]Итог:[/h2]
Sniper Elite V2 - это отличная игра не только про снайперский экшн, но и песочница, дающая игрокам вариативность прохождения. Такие игры откладываются в памяти игроков на долгое время. Тактика, экшн, отличный геймплей - всё это франшиза Sniper Elite.

 | Great mulriplayer party game. local multiplayer makes it great for an evening of friendly (or not so) carnage bringing out the competitive in everyone! | **Title:** ""Duck Game: Quack, Shoot, Die, Repeat – The Best Multiplayer Combat Game You Didn’t Know You Needed""  

**Review:**  
*Duck Game* is the multiplayer combat game you never knew you needed, and now that you’ve experienced it, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without it. Picture this: You’re a tiny, adorable duck with a shotgun, battling other ducks who are also armed to the beak, and it’s glorious. Every round is a chaotic, hilarious free-for-all where the only thing more dangerous than your enemies is your own reflexes.  

The mechanics are as simple as they are absurd. You run, you shoot, and you try not to blow yourself up while your friends laugh maniacally as they do just that. The best part? The weapons. There are so many ridiculous options—flamethrowers, grenades, rocket launchers, and even, yes, a literal swordfish. Every round feels like you’re stuck in a fast-paced, chaotic fever dream, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.  

The levels are delightfully weird, ranging from tiny, claustrophobic arenas where you’ll be trapped with no escape but a barrel of TNT, to larger arenas that can make even the most hardened players panic when they realize they’re out of ammo and a duck with a bazooka is charging at them. The game thrives on its unpredictability. You never know when you’ll be thrown into a wild situation, but you can bet that it’ll involve either a duck explosion or a surprise victory because someone managed to walk into their own mine.  

But here’s the real magic: *Duck Game* is the kind of game that makes friendships stronger—or destroys them, depending on how often you’re gunned down by your best friend. It’s the perfect blend of competitiveness and comedy, where every victory feels earned, and every defeat is hilarious enough to make you want to keep playing. It’s impossible to take seriously, and that’s exactly why it’s so addictive.  

Verdict: *Duck Game* is a chaotic, unpredictable masterpiece of multiplayer fun. It’s one of the top 3 best multiplayer combat games ever because it never stops being fun—even when you're getting shot in the face by a duck who *accidentally* grabbed the wrong weapon. 10/10 would quack my way into another round.  

**Disclaimer:** This review was written by an AI who has never wielded a shotgun as a duck, but deeply respects those who do. Complaints should be directed to the nearest duck, preferably one with a swordfish. | Juegaso para pasar el rato, me encanta matar a mis amigos enemigos con una escopeta manejada por un pato morado con cabeza de tronco para después abusar sexualmente del cadáver mientras me rió maliciosamente con cuacks.

76561198041304371,316010,Magic Duels,0.1,"Free To Play, Strategy",0,"A little background, I am both a big fan of the 'free to play' model as well as the Magic The Gathering card game.
I've been playing Magic for about four years now.
I've owned a few of the other digital game versions as well as having a few competitive decks in real life as well.

It's been no secret that many people have found the digital series to be pretty hit or miss. I don't know what Wizard's of The Coast does to miss the boat so hard. But I'll first put this review into a technical and then a business sense:

What works about the game:
-Bare bones, the game launches, plays, has a GUI and from what I've seen as of February, very little bugs. It's a smooth experience to start and once you get into the interface it's an enjoyable segue into the game.
-The music as always is top notch. I have yet to see anyone lodge a complaint against the music
-Fair art direction. The cards already have art that they have on file so it's hard to say that they really go out of their way with the art on the cards. However, the 3D cutscenes don't quite match the style of the cards and come off more as a Nickelodeon spinoff of Magic; which, depending on your preference, may be a good thing.
-The deck builder that everyone's been asking for is here. People complain about it not featuring a 'search by name' function. But I truly don't care. If you can remember the picture it takes all of about two seconds. And even if you unlock all the cards, it doesn't hurt to give your other options a browse while you flip to the card you want.

What doesn't work-
Now, before I get into the blemishes, it should be said that I generally enjoy the game but a review in my book is to tell people whether or not the product is worth investing in.
-The RNG. The point of the RNG being so poor is obviously an incentive to get you to buy more and more boosters. Hopefully with your own money. An easy way to observe this is to play the story mode decks. The 'challenge' often doesn't come from having a winnable deck and being forced to outthink your opponent's cards. It's redrawing, and restarting the duel over and over and over until you get a really good hand, (Hopefully with good draws afterward) and sometimes even then, some duels I found were almost impossible to win unless the opponent suffered from several bad draws.
-The Free To Pay model. Now, as I said, I love Free to Play. That's an awesome step forward with games with a competitive environment. I'll talk more about that in a second. But the problem here is that in the competitive side of the game, there's a huge incentive put on buying better cards than everyone else. Keep buy buy buying and hope your RNG gets you better cards than the other guy. A little RNG isn't bad, it keeps things interesting. However, when the incentive is to force the player to spend money when they would rather play with skill, then it's a waste of development time as you'll be seeing diminishing returns on your usage of those features.

What's just in the middle?
Well, between good and bad there's a few things that just sort of fall by the wayside.
-The free cards you earn are not very competitive.
Grinding for better cards can be fun. However, it shouldn't be done in the multiplayer against people with better cards, or at the very least not left to RNG boosters. Not neccessarily saying that the cards offered from the story should be perfectly competitive, but at least enough (if you've completed the whole story) to be able to play against starting level duelists.
-Lack of dynamic matchmaking
As far as I can tell, there's not really any matchmaking algorithms in place to match you with people at your skill level. You seem to be matched with just whoever happens to be playing. This results often in playing against other players with much better or much worse cards than you rather than someone who offers a challenge and a fun game.
-Lack of players
I don't know how many people actually play this game. But I'm judging that not a lot do from how long it can take to matchmake. I guess many people would just rather play the hard-format card game.

Ways to fix it really simply-
1.) First fix and probably most important: specifically two modes that I think will make the game even worth installing-
-Team battle: Basically, five players on each team (5v5) or (4v4) or (3v3) duel it out with premade competitive decks (similar to picking a hero in Dota, each deck has unique themes and abilities and once picked, can't be picked by the enemy team).
This is going to be the main draw of the game. Teams can use game chat to speak to eachother, and make tactical decisions. Suddenly there's a team dynamic, and it's even better than just playing 1v1 with a friend.
-Free battles: These are the current gametypes but reworked. #2 will talk about how to improve this mode. These are duels using decks that you've assembled yourself using the cards that are in the game. However, there can be certain rules applied:
Legacy, Modern, etc.

2.)Observe functioning Free to play systems: perhaps some of the best and most marketably viable free to play models are actually on Steam. Team Fortress and Dota 2 come with their own brand of users and you take them or leave them. Magic is much the same. However to make Magic work as an online game, all the content of the game needs to be free and readily available with balancing patches to control the meta game.
The reason why this works: players can spend more time on the game getting better, and more competitive with the game. Switching the content you want to buy to cosmetic, makes the game more worth playing.

3.) By switching the focus to cosmetic, people invest more time into the game. As they invest, they spend more. I hate to say it, but Dota found the magic formula. You spend X amount of hours and as X+fun=Financial investment.
Now you may say, but that still applies to this game! However, consider that because it's also pay to win RNG, you've got to face facts and admit that you've also got, X+fun-(loss x loss conditions)=fincancial investment. The greater the amount of losses, the less likely that user is to spend money on anything in the game. Nobody except a very small handful of people with huge egos will buy boosters just to compete in a pay to win game. It's very niche. The rest of the people willing to buy are hardcore magic fans who are already likely to just buy hard copies of cards.

Ultimately Wizards is in no financial trouble. However, they are walking away from a lot of money with this particular online game. By tweaking their approach by a bit, their financial rewards could be greater.

Players however, if you are a huge Magic fan then you'll love that the game is free to play, but may grow tired of the monotonous grinding for boosters and long loss streaks in attempts to get better cards with less frustrating outcomes.
If you're not a fan of Magic, but a fan of card games looking to install one on steam, then try it out.
If you're not a fan of Magic and can take or leave a card game, then pass. There are plenty of other, (better) free to play games out there.

If the game is updated to a state where it adresses some of its core issues, then I will happily update this review. | bonjour a toute l'équipe , je me prénomme nadège je suis maman et je suis atteinte d'une maladie qui m'oblige a rester alliter et j'avoue que magic me fait passer des heures agréable et m'occupe bien ...donc pour cela je vous remercie tous ... cepentdant les petits hics de magic sont : les decs de départ devrais etre dissociés d'avec les dec d'aide constructeur pour les confirmée et j'avous que se systeme d'aide mais souvent précieux mais je retrouve souvent mes anciens jeux ....le deuxieme hic que je rencontre c'est avec les mauvais joueurs en effet quand ils n'ont pas de jeux ils font tourner le chrono jusqu'à la fin je pense que pour ce genre de technic vous devriez mettre en place un chrono dégréssif comme ca plus ils attendent sur le chrono ben le second tour leurs chrono et plus rapid ou plus cour bref voilà mes opinions je vous remercie une nouvelle fois et faite que votre jeu dure toujours car je l'adore amitié a tous .........      nadège | I recently started getting back into magic after being inactive for around 15 years. However, other than standard tournaments, I don't have many opportunities to play against other players, so I figured I needed an online version of magic to practice. Magic duels is OK to get back into the mechanics and see what other people play, but other than that, it's a HUGE disappointment:

- Insane grind. buying boosters as a poor kid in the 90ies (p2w in its pure form) was more fun.

- Stupid deck restrictions: rares 2x, uncommons 3x (to keep serious players away or p2w low?)

- Strange format: not pure standard, balance seems off ( banned smuggler's copter still being played, too many cheap removal spells...)

- Terrible connectivity: connection losses all the time, dropped players get replaced by AI and most of the time, you have to beat the AI in order to not receive a loss, alt+tab is all it takes to get disconnected, possibly lots of room for exploits. Lags are so hard that often you can't hit the stop button to react to your opponent, which defeats the whole purpose of playing magic. 

- No possibility to interact with other players: no chat, no trade, nothing. Which might be wise, because...

- The duels community equals the bottom of the magic community. You won't find many good matches, real magic fans are probablly somewhere else to be found. Often enough, playing a removal spell is all that it takes for your opponent to pull the plug and let the AI take over.... which surprisingly often leads to the AI coming back hard and winning a lost match... and then there are these assholes just waiting everytime as long as the timer allows (playing a land after waiting for 1 minute) to make YOU unpatient and disconnect, giving them a default win.

- Always playing against the same decks. Right now: red burn, topters, green ramp, sphinx tutelage. boring.

- The campaigns are a joke. The way they try to tell stories is just unworthy of the magic universe. It's nothing but still images and written dialouge, combined with a muted 90ies-style render-cutscene at the end of each campaign. And the stories are just boring. It rather ruins the unvierse for me...

- Presentation is rudimentary at best. Graphics are just the cards, a boring table, generic FX like fireballs and lightnings... even tablets could do better. There is only 1 music track playing throughout the whole game and it will drive you insane after the 2nd loop.

I honestly can't find a reason to play this other than getting a very blury first impression of what magic the gathering is and that it's probably best to stay away from it lol. Do yourself a favor and play real magic or Xmage. I honestly can't understand the people giving this a thumps up. Probably the kind of people going to McDonalds when they're hungry and liking every shit on facebook... | 为什么都要和炉石做对比，这明明就是鼻祖好么。

[h1]ACTUAL REVIEW[/h1]

I've invested a decent amount of time and more money than I care to admit in this game, so I feel its time to give it an honest review.

[u]Pros[/u]
+ Teaches you how to play MTG, So it's a good game to pick up for new players along with returning players needing a refresher.
+ Atmospheric campaigns that introduce you to each new set while also earning you coins.
+ Game limits your collection and deck to only one mythic, 2 rares, 3 uncommon, and 4 common cards of any individual card. This creates an artificial buffer and prevents players with too much money/time from building crazy decks that will dominate the metagame. 
+ Finite amount of cards for each set, meaning eventually you will have every card in the set. With older sets going on sale every so often to help build your collection more quickly.
+ 150 coin price tag is very fair for a booster of 6 cards. Winning a multiplayer match earns you 30 coins plus any bonuses for completing weekly and daily quests means you can unlock at least one new booster every day with a decent deck.
+ Every set since Origins has been included, and they continue to add new blocks as they come out, with some card exceptions that would be too complicated to code in a vs format.
+ All the fun of FNM, minus the smell.

[u]Cons[/u]
- Mana tapping system needs work, though there is a mana tapping key, often times it either doesn't work correctly or is just too clucky to use in the limited time you have to play your turn. Nothing is more frustrating than a match going sideways because the game chose to tap the wrong mana for you.
- Game is very buggy at times, I had to leave a match I was winning because the game refused to unzoom a card and blocked my view of the battlefield. Another time, the game froze on the ""opponent watching animations screen"" and it cost me the match. 
- Game has been out long enough for there to be enough ""auto include"" mythics and rares between all the sets to make it frustrating to play vs battles at times. I've run out of fingers and toes for the amount of times I've seen ""Combustable Gearhulk"" in any deck that has red in it.
- Game really favors the constructed format of the game, which can be jarring/frustrating for players that like to play limted formats like draft, sealed, and pauper. 
- Plainswalkers dominate the game. Some are pretty benign, but you'll see the frustrating ones enough to make you walk away from the game at times. (I personally haven't liked plainswalkers when they were introduced years ago, At least back then they were reasonable being 6 drops with something along the lines of ""+1: Target creature gets +1/+1"" not 4 drops with ""+3: Make game unplayable."")
- No In-game chat with other players. (I would probably get banned if we actually had this, I'm humble enough to know I can be a sore winner/loser.)
-All the frustration of FNM, minus the smell.

I really like Magic duels, but I also hate it just as much. I've lost count of how many times I've walked away from the game, never to play again, just to find myself back again in another duel 30 minutes later. I honestly think you need to be a little bit of a masochist to enjoy this game. 

If you like MTG, you'll feed that itch with this game. If you want to learn MTG, this game is a good jumping off point. If you want to stare blankly at the screen in a silent burning rage that could fuel a thousand suns, this game is for you."
76561198041304371,316790,Grim Fandango Remastered,1.9166666666666667,Adventure,6,"You know when you find an old film noir movie on telly at 3 AM, and you think 'this looks ancient, I'll give it five minutes,' then suddenly it's morning and you've watched the whole thing? That's what playing Grim Fandango Remastered is like. Except everyone's dead and speaking in puns. Brilliant.

I first played this back in '98 when I was probably wearing something embarrassing and had questionable hair. But unlike my fashion choices from that era, this game has aged like a fine wine - well, mostly. The writing's as sharp as a comedian doing their best material at the Apollo. The dialogue's got more wit than a room full of Oscar Wilde types at a cocktail party. And the story? Imagine if Raymond Chandler wrote a noir detective story, but everyone's a skeleton, and it's set in the Mexican Land of the Dead. Mental, innit?

The music's this gorgeous love child between a smoky jazz club and a Mexican fiesta - absolutely brilliant stuff. The characters stick in your mind like that awkward conversation you had with your boss at the Christmas party. You've got more personality in this bunch of skeletal misfits than you'd find in the entire cast of most modern games - and they're literally just walking bones! There's our hero Manny Calavera, who's basically what you'd get if you crossed a travel agent with the Grim Reaper and gave him a sense of humor drier than the Sahara.

Now, let's address the elephant in the room - or should I say the pixelated skeleton? The remaster's like when you see an aging rock star who's had a bit of work done - the important bits look better, but you can still tell they're from the '90s. The backgrounds are about as high-res as my first mobile phone photo, and the 4:3 aspect ratio means you've got these black bars on the side like you're watching an old episode of Friends.

The puzzles? Some are proper head-scratchers. There were times I felt like I needed a PhD in skeleton logic to figure them out. Other times, the solution was so obvious, I wanted to give myself a slap. It's like when you lose your keys and spend 20 minutes looking for them, only to find they're in your hand - that kind of feeling.

But here's the thing - despite its wrinkles and gray hairs, Grim Fandango is still an absolute masterpiece. It's like that old pub that hasn't changed its decor since the 70s but serves the best Sunday roast in town.

If you're wondering whether to pick it up, let me put it this way: If you can handle graphics that make Minecraft look like a 4K nature documentary, and you're not the type to throw a wobbly over pixels the size of your dad's garden shed, then for god's sake, play this game. Because under those chunky pixels is more charm than a con man at a pensioner's bingo night. And that's not just the nostalgia talking - though I have had a few drinks. | Excellent game! Fun puzzles, very beautiful, silly personal story, fantastic voice acting and music. Enjoyed every moment of it. | lowkey one of the best games with proper storytelling  and soundtracks , even though i'm on year 1 so far | Grim Fandango is SO GOOD! I finally played and completed this game this weekend. I'm 26 years late to this party BUT I have to say, what a work of art!

Grim Fandango is a true gaming classic, and often touted as one of the greatest point & click games ever made, even if it was also the reaper that felled the genre. Although, like any old game, the bones this remaster is built on are a bit rough, this game is as eternal as a soul in the afterlife. Now it’s time for me to make like Manny and implore you to buy this game.

[b]Steam Deck Support:[/b]
I played it 90% docked, but with correct setup, the trackpads make this game easily playable, and it feels almost natural to play a point & click that way. I don’t think I need to comment on how well it runs.

Grim Fandango is a game that has been stuck with me since I played it as a kid, believing it was never going to hold a candle to the masterpiece that was Monkey Island. The game’s vibe was just so unique and its premise so wild, that my brain gave up trying to compartmentalise the experience, created a new core memory instead, then sat down for a drink. It’s hard to write an elevator pitch for what Grim fandango is: It’s a weird blend of cultures and ideas that draw from film noir, art deco and latin american folklore. Manny Calavera, a failing afterlife salesman for the DoD (Department of Death) is forced by his conscience into an unwitting adventure across the land of the dead, spanning multiple years.   

[h2]Four Years in Heaven[/h2]
Let me tell you about that vibe. People will quote Mirror’s Edge and Skyrim as examples of how art direction ages better than graphical fidelity, but in my mind Grim Fandango is the purest example of that. Remaster or not, this game looks as beautiful as the day it released.

A benefit of using a static image as each map is that it allows the creators to play with composition and lighting in a way that would normally be undermined by player control. Pre-rendered scenery also gives the devs better control over lighting, and here they have leveraged that opportunity to such an effect that it would make a ray tracing core blush. Often, I find point & click games don’t make enough use of this opportunity, but not Grim Fandango. The developers are constantly playing with camera angle and shot size, drawing inspiration from the same cinema the game constantly pays homage to. Examples abound: shots from Manny’s sleazy office building are reminiscent of CCTV footage, while those from lonely bars place you in the seat of a tired and nameless patron.

Film noir’s influence is hard at work making every scene as brooding and mysterious as possible, but there are other influences too. Grim Fandango somehow blends the grayscale of film noir with the explosive colour of a Mexican holiday in a way so natural that I just assumed the two were made for each other. Amongst all of these huge successes in creative direction, Grim Fandango’s [i]soundtrack[/i] manages to stand out. Like everything else in the game, the score is an eclectic mix of influences ranging from sombre mariachi, through Hitchcock-esque orchestra, to smoky jazz. It’s hard to write about how well the music works given it’s a medium I have scant knowledge of, but the impact here is certainly felt. Grim Fandango's score supercharges a game that is already dripping with atmosphere into something even modern games struggle to match. I do wish the music was blended a little better though: Songs restart every time you change screens, which means unless you stop to listen, a lot of ambient tracks won’t be heard all the way through. In particular, Manny’s demonic companion Glottis has a secret performance so good that I had to double check the voice actor wasn’t moonlighting as a blues vocalist. 

[h2]You Might as well Enjoy the Trip[/h2]
Of course, Grim Fandango’s story has aged like a bottle of Marillo de Oro. Manny starts out trying to sell the recently deceased tickets on the number 9 express to heaven. He then discovers the tickets, and the job that sells them, are part of a rabbit hole of corruption that goes so deep it plumbs the literal depths of the ocean. 
This is a story straight out of [i]Casablanca[/i], one sporting naïve heroes, sleazy salesmen, mob plots and [i]La Revolución[/i]. It would be boring if Grim Fandango didn’t tell the story so masterfully, and the recognisable tale being told gives the player an anchor of familiarity to cling to in an otherwise alien world.
Along with the story, Grim Fandango’s writing is just masterful in general. Tim Schafer’s razor wit adds a necessary level of playfulness to the otherwise serious story, much like the colours of [i]Día de los Muertos[/i] add life to the game’s otherwise shadowy aesthetic. As mentioned earlier, this game is so layered that it cuts across all ages without ever feeling like a sacrifice was made. As a kid, Glottis’s slapstick escapades had me rolling, while adult me is nearly in tears after accidentally forming a [spoiler]worker bee labour movement.[/spoiler]

Point & click gameplay often just amounts to puzzles, and even though these are the backbone of Grim Fandango’s gameplay, they’re also where the game tends to fall flat. The Puzzles relying on classic point & click design, notably all of part 2 are fantastic, if a little hard: one hilarious puzzle requires you to [spoiler]exploit glottis’ overindulgence in alcohol to force him to vomit a pool of liquid you can then freeze, disarming a devious domino-based trap[/spoiler] for example. Sadly Grim Fandango also has a lot of puzzles relying on its awkward proto-3D movement, possibly as an attempt to force the genre into a third dimension to keep up with the times. These puzzles, and the movement they are based on, are as obtuse as they are frustrating. The camera seems to arbitrarily switch perspectives, confusing your movement even further. Furthermore, Grim Fandango has an absolutely shocking number of timing-based puzzles, which are [i]never[/i] a good idea in point & click games. Luckily the game stopped short at causing me to rapidly deconstruct my keyboard, but the fact it got so close is something to be wary of.

The Land of the Dead as a concept is so well developed that it feels like the IP has been around for way longer than a single game. There are so many ideas and influences at every turn that I’m amazed its creators were able to contain them and prevent them from becoming overbearing. Some of my favourite ideas in particular are the use of fast-growing plants as weaponry, the “business scythes” used by the DoD, and the Aztec-inspired pyramid and gatekeeper serving as the final crossing to the underworld.
 
People throw the word “classic” around often enough that it has lost its true meaning. That said, if any game is a classic then Grim Fandango is, a classic that shines as an example of the heights a now much less prevalent genre once reached. Indeed, as good as Grim Fandango was, it was also a near commercial failure, and one of the reasons Lucasarts moved away from the genre. Grim Fandango is a ride on the Number 9 Express to point & click heaven, and so the only question left is whether you want to buy a ticket?

Ocena końcowa: 
11/10 | Gerçekten bir moda göre olağanüstü diyebilirim . Bu kadar zaman nasıl görmedim bu modu anlamış da değilim . Adeta Portal 3 tadında . Ücretsiz olmasına da ayrı bir şaşırmıştım . Portal 1 ve 2 den dolayı aklınızda kalmış soru işaretlerini tamamen siliyor . Bölümleri serinin diğer oyunlarına göre zor diyebilirim . Sanırım Wheatley'den dolayı bu ""Core""lara pek ısınamamıştım . Bu mod ise bize bambaşka ve yardımsever bir core olan Virgil'i sunuyor . Oyunun sonundaki bir detay ise Portal 2 den hatırlarsanız eğer Wheatley bizi uyandırdığında ""Dokuzdokuzdokuzdokuz... gündür uykudasınız."" gibi bir söz söylemişti. Fazla spoiler vermek istemem ama oyunda var olan bir makineden ötürü böyle olduğunu anlıyoruz ve son kısımda dikkatli dinlerseniz ""Dokuzdokuzdokuzdokuz... gündür uykudasınız."" diyerek Portal 2 ye bağladığını görebilirsiniz . Oyun Aperture Science nin ilk zamanlarını anlatıyor . Cave Johnson'ın tuz madenlerini aldığı zamanları . Hatta ilk başta Aperture Science'ye bir tren içinde giriyoruz . Bunun da Half Life'da Black Mesa'ya tren ile girişimize yapılan bir gönderme diyebilirim . Portal silahımız ise ikinci oyundan daha geçmişte oynadığımız için dolayısıyla biraz daha değişik . Sonuç olarak hikaye açısından bir mod olmasına rağmen önceki oyunlar ile bağlantısı çok yüksek . Ayrıca oyun standalone . Portal dosyalarınıza zarar vermeden ayrı bir oyun olarak kütüphanenize geliyor . Eğer Portal 2 niz varsa ve bu modu indirmemişseniz bu modu yüklemenizi şiddetle tavsiye ediyorum . | It's hard to give a thumbs down to something that's both free and presented so well, but alas, the more I play, the more I dislike it, even as a get better at solving the puzzles as I've learned what's expected of me and the typical tropes. Seriously, I'm practically flying through the levels now, and yet still feel more exhausting than fun. This is compounded by the poor humor that's an inferior version of the original, coupled with bad voice acting that you're absolutely bombarded with, and also boring, amateurish music that in some cases doesn't even loop properly. I'm actually amazed at the effort though, that a free fan made mod actually went to such lengths to write new (albeit unoriginal and amateur) lines and have them acted out, but once the novelty wears thin you'll begin to find each line of dialougue more and more grating. 

Plenty of other thumbs downers have touched on the difficulty in solving the puzzles, all the while managing to make themselves sound like maybe they're the ones who are just bad at puzzles. I think it's more that the bar that this franchise has set is incredibly high, and this feels poorly designed in comparison. It isn't only that, it's in the way the puzzles are challenging that makes them feel like drudgery. Almost every puzzle has you reaching the exit only to have you turn around and realize you need to bring with you all those boxes that got you there, which just feels cheap compared to the original where most of the time getting to the exit meant success. Puzzles here feel confined and super restricted to a very narrow way of solving, whereas in portal 2 you're having fun learning new puzzle mechanics and flying around playing with physics, here there are no new mechanics so what they've done is tried to up the challenge instead. The original also had excellent pacing, mixing up the puzzle solving runs with the story/adventure parts. In this, the puzzle sections seem to drag on, especially when you solved something tough and see that you're on puzzle 2 of 12.  

Overall this is an awesome effort, I just really can't wrap my head around the fact they had multiple playtesters that were ok with the tediousness of the puzzles. It's a well presented addition to the portal story plagued by lackluster voicework/music and puzzles that just aren't fun. | This game should (and in my mind is) be part of the Portal mythos.

The balancing feels somewhat off, it's very difficult on the 4th difficulty and pretty much too easy on the third, also you'll get punished and lose xp for playing on lower difficulties which makes utilizing new crew members just even more of an annoying grind. 

There are a couple of other game design choices which bothered me. You are only able to sell items in the loadout screen before a mission or when your inventory is full after a mission, whenever you are in a shop and want to buy something new but you are full you can't - you have to go back to a mission into the loadout screen, sell it there and then comeback - waiting for docking inbetween makes this even more of a pain. 

Whenever there are multiple enemies swarming you, they usually won't utilize the game mechanics of bouncing bullets against walls or rarely flank you, they will just run up to your cover, hold their barrel into it and shoot directly through it, into your face - which feels pretty lame and like not very well coded enemy behaviour. 

Whenever you get overwhelmed and fail a mission you'll lose a good chunk of your ingame curreny - so the entire process of making progress doesn't come down to how smart you play because the level design doesn't bring many opportunities to do so - it comes down how good you've grinded up your character level and gear. I don't think this is a good game design choice for a linear casual game. You'll utilize the same 3-4 squad members and you'll repeat the same gameplay loop over and over again until you've finished the game. If you can't continue you simply need to grind.  

Hats serve no purpose and are just for cosmetics. 

All in all the game feels like a rather shallow 2D X-COM and it definitely has it's flaws. I still think that it has charm and is fun for atleast a couple of hours. I'd barely recommend it whenever it's on heavy discount otherwise I wouldn't. (6/10) | This game is a really fun turn-based tactical shooter. However, it falls apart at the higher difficulties due to the alarm mechanic which forces a slower turn based gameplay into a rush as more enemies pile in which can quickly overwhelm you. This is even worse towards the end of the game as you get enemies which can teleport and shoot on the same turn with two or three enemies spawning each turn. This game definitely rewards quicker strategy over slow turn based turtling combat like XCOM. The 100% for this is also really difficult with the whole game being required to be completed on the highest difficulty with no mission failures, all missions fully completed, and in 800 turns or less across the whole game. | Игра супер!

The next day I started again and managed to build a more gentle society that was more fit for survival. Kept hundreds of people alive without crossing any serious moral lines. I'm worried, that I can't stop thinking about more effective way to build my city and society. Maybe I can do it without child labor? Maybe there's a way for me to take in all refugees I encounter?

76561198041304371,333930,Dirty Bomb®,0.0,"Action, Free To Play",0,"Lets dismiss the rumor that this game is Pay 2 Win, it actually isn't anywhere close to it. If you were to personally ask me what P2W is, I'd say, ""Games with weapons or unlockables (Generally ones that give you an advantage or are just overpowered) not obtainable through playing the game for free, instead using real world money to unlock it.""

TL;DR: Everything above Bronze in loadouts is cosmetic. Characters rotate to play for free every week.

How this game works is entirely different, you get loadout cards, now while you might think, ""Oh, well that must mean that everything Silver and Gold is better than things that are Bronze."" This is not correct, every card above Bronze simply works as a form of cosmetic.
On the other hand you have people that would say, ""Getting a Bronze card would mean you have way too many advantages over players that don't."" This is also not true, as the bronze cards simply give you perks on the side that give you small boosts, no gun damage, health (Except for one perk that gives you up to 30 health for dying multiple times) or other character attributes altered with cards.

Now with these loadout cards, you also get different weapons. These weapons on the loadout cards will change how you play your character. By default you have good loadouts, you can destroy anybody with the basic loadouts so long as you can aim, your guns make you, not your perks. You can get a different gun for every rarity of loadout, even the worst rarities come with guns that can change how you play by alot, but for the most part all the guns are reletively balanced.

Next comes the whole RNG thing that people get very angry at because they can't find good things in cases. 1000 ingame credits = 1 case, this case grants you 1 random loadout card in the game, with the higher tier rarities being lower chances of obtaining, but still possible. if you really want to go all out, you can spend 5 dollars in real world money for some random cases that are primarily used for the higher chance at getting Gold and Cobalt loadouts, but still guarenteed a Silver loadout.

The crafting system is next and it's pretty simple, put in cards you don't like of the same rarity and get the next loadout rarity up, you also select any of the characters that you want a loadout specifically for. Essentially trade up contracts in CS:GO. Pretty easy to understand, gives you another chance at randomizing and it's a way of letting you get loadouts that are Silver and higher without the RNG chance, however the weapons and perks are randomized each time. 
With that being said, if you find that you can't be bothered to open up cases for 1000 ingame credits, you can simply save up enough to just buy a bronze loadout that you like.

Next comes characters. Here's where people have whined most about the game. ""6-10 Dollars for a single character in this game? What a ripoff!"" And here's where I come in and say ""You don't need to spend money, blah blah blah, you can play the game normally and get every character you just need to save up a bit.""
On top of this, there is a free character rotation every week. Just like in League of Legends, every week three characters become unlocked for the week's duration as playable characters, afterwards you need to purchase them to keep them permanently.

To end this I'm simply going to put it. The game is fun, not Pay 2 Win, and it's starting to take up time I would spend playing Tf2. | Most fun I've had with an FPS in a long time. Pretty fast-paced combat, classes aren't too gimmicky. Anyone who digs Enemy Territory or thought Brink had a ton of potential should definitely check it out | I find DB has drifted from what I would want in a game to something I don't like. More importantly, I don't think it will improve enough to enjoy going forward, so I'm going to uninstall DB.

The fundamental reason I'm going to uninstall is that the initial and early characters didn't feel too gimmicky, and they tended to work together. Since that time, they've become more and more ridiculous. Constantly putting in characters that don't really mesh together isn't helping the team aspect of the game. When you can help your team while still shooting the enemy and not need to make a decision about which to do, you have a problem. Throwing health packs, ammo, and needing to be on top of people to revive them encourages smart team play. ""Don't run into the open, we can't pick you up"" Sparks the medic comes out, and more fools over-extend because you can revive them now at a distance, instead of them being dead and gibbed, and they can be picked up. Not being revived is the game punishing bad play by those who over-extend. Javelin dispenses ammo even in fire-fights, so who needs to manage and plan for their ammo? Getting into long fire-fights back in 2015 used to require someone to be very good at managing ammo and position. You had to bring a support character, but that person needed excellent positioning to be able to toss that pack and hit a teammate who needs it without giving it to the enemy, and then quickly be back in the fight. The same is true of the medics. Running a combo of medic/ammo giver required great support. Automatically dispensing ammo in a circle around you doesn't force you to think about how to help your team, and you can help without actively helping. You can both help you team with a power, and shoot an enemy. This isn't encouraging teammates to help each other, it just encourages them to bunch up. Further, key abilities can be done by everyone, like repairing, planting explosives, and reviving. This dilutes the need to take certain classes at all.

Further, rarely has a new character been balanced on release, which means in the the intervening time between release and patch you face a lot of people playing a broken character. In-fact, new characters were never allowed straight into ranked. They would hold them back because they knew they weren't balanced. They eventually gets nerfed, frequently too far, and the cycle repeats. This is irritating, but I also know that characters aren't balanced until you really get a lot of people playing them. I don't know why they feel so far off each time, but I suspect it is because of the aforementioned decision to keep pushing out characters that have odd abilities that need to be special to justify making a new merc. Balancing among more and more abilities also takes more and more effort - effort that could be spent making the one thing that doesn't get enough attention - maps.

Maps. You need more maps. You always need more maps. More maps means more unique strategies, it means you can play a lot of matches without repeating maps (back when there were only 6 maps, I took lots of several week or several month breaks because I didn't want to play the same maps over and over). Each map should highlight a few abilities. You can get the objective done without them and successfully defend without them, but on some maps, some characters should shine without being overpowered. Each map should be able to take advantage of each merc's abilities. I know this is a tall order, but you want to be great, right? The more abilities you have, the more trouble you have where you get into a map and think, ""I brought a terrible merc for this map."" That should not happen, ever. Rhino is a good example. There are some maps where I will never take him, he's far too slow, and he needs to be on top of people to do damage. There are too many maps where he cannot do much, and very few maps where he can truly shine. Similarly, taking Skyhammer or Arty in Underground, is a waste of time (Skyhammer's marker does act like a grenade, but it isn't a great one). Stoker, on the other hand, dominates in Undergound because his ability is always useful. There is no need for that enormous discrepancy between characters. This removes flexibility to form and break defenses. 

While this is definitely a personal preference, the worst part about this game is being one-shot. I don't know why people think this is fun in an arcade-style shooter. In ARMA, SWAT, Rainbow 6, being one-shot killed is fine and I like those games, but not in a game like this. It wasn't fun 20 years ago with the rocket launchers in Quake and Unreal, it still isn't now. The wide-spread availabilty and ease-of-use of one-shot weapons in this game is killing my enjoyment (and I realize that this is a very personal complaint, hence the reason I listed it last). The fact that most people cannot use one-shot weapons well in a fast-moving arcade-style shooter doesn't make them balanced. In any game, when you balance to the average, you neglect that part of the population who will take the time needed to perfect the one-shot (or power, skill, etc.) who will still continue to dominate with over-powered weapons/abiliites, etc. This is where the accurate arcade-style shooting and movement work against you - perfecting that one-shot is 100% doable. I've met and seen plenty of people who have perfected it. For awhile, I could do it pretty well, but it felt really cheap and dirty, so I stopped. Once you master the one-shot kill, it's a joke for those who don't. Removing scope sway on snipers - terrible move, the sway at least made the one-shot kills reasonably rare but threatening. The reviver railgun of doom - terrible move. I still stuck around, despite really not liking these changes. The additional of Javelin was another change that I didn't like. What purpose does she serve? There are characters who can break-up camps, if they're not doing the job, adjust them! Instead, you put in the one-shot rocket of doom, something I was really proud of you for not putting in the game from day one. An arcade style game balanced without a rocket launcher. Ponder that. We had that.

Coming back after a long break, I wanted to see how the game progressed. I see the new characters introduced, and one of them is Hunter - he has a crossbow that can one-shot people. After playing a few games against people with Hunter, I can see once again that the higher-skilled players are STILL taking the high-damage sniper rifles, and Hunter. I used to accept being one-shot as part of the game, but I just don't want to deal with it anymore. If I want to be killed in one shot while moving around a corner, I'll play the SWAT and Rainbow 6 games - realistic shooters. Not in arcade shooters. I want teamwork, but that can't be had, because not enough abilities force you to support or rely your team. I used to think that the self-healing that all mercs have was fine, but as time went on, I found myself drawn to characters that had ""tough"" perk because I didn't need a medic. Ammo is easy to come by, generally, and rarely do you need to go far out of the way to get it, so who needs those pesky teammates? Going to get ammo shouldn't be easy, a team game should prefer you to get it from teammates, and hence punish you by having inconvenient ammo supply locations.

In case you are wondering, I don't play Overwatch. I saw enough in the videos to know that it wasn't what I was looking for. And now, very sadly, I must conclude that Dirty Bomb joins it.

Finally, I apologize for mistakes - I edited this heavily to make sure my thoughts were coordinated, but I suspect there are errors still left. | Back in 2003, Splash Damage released a standalone freeware game known as Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.  It combined the speed and movement of Quake and the hitscan and aiming mechanics of Counter-Strike into a objective-based game.  The focus on team-oriented objectives created a very popular fps game that sadly had a community die off and move on.

Splash Damage attempted to revive the series with with Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, but was largely unsucessful.

Welcome to Dirty Bomb, the newest reincarnation of the gameplay.  It feels and plays like the first legitemate sucessor to Enemy Territory.  With similar team-based classes, and a much more noob-friendly interface than ET could ever muster, this game could possibly be the first game that is a legitemate competitor to CSGO in terms of competitive FPS games... as long as Nexon doesn't FUCK everything up and make the game p2w.

The shooting mechanics combine that of quake and counter-strike.  Players are tanky and can take 2 or 3 headshots to kill.  However, similar to CS, aiming for the head is highly rewarding as most guns will kill in 8 to 10 shots (generally it takes a little less than 2 seconds to kill a player with body shots).  Additionally, you're highly accurate while moving, which makes strafe shooting a viable and effective strategy.

Don't let the cartoonish atmosphere fool you, however.  Despite its simplistic nature, there is a lot of depth to the game in taking fights, healing with medics, and even intentionally suiciding to respawn with full ammo or to defend an objective.

If you like playing competitive FPS games, give this one a fair shot.  The gameplay is quite unforgiving for new players, but highly rewarding if you stick with it. | By far my favorite FPS game on PC and one of the best i've played ever, with the added plus that it is FREEE! While it is not pay to win, it definitly requires skill and somewhat good reaction speed. It is incredibly fast paced, with battles happening across the various maps. It has a selection of 20 different mercs, with an array of abilities that include but not limited to land mines, airstrikes,and revive guns. It's devs pay close attention to their fan base and always try to respond, while keeping them up to date with every new piece added to the game. All in all, the best PC game I have played yet and it receives the highest recommendations I can give. A game worth playing :D

edit:they have added even more characters and weapons,
and I want my nomination task finished. Play Dirty!

76561198041304371,319630,Life is Strange - Episode 1,1.5666666666666667,"Action, Adventure",1,"[b]An intimate diary tribute to the 10th anniversary of Max’s journey.[/b]

It used to be a tradition for me to play [i]Life is Strange[/i] every New Year’s Eve when visiting my childhood home. So many memories intertwine with it. Jumping up and down on the bed losing my mind after the 3Ep twist. Bugging my classmates with a basket of theories and insane lore about the game's development. Cutting my hair slowly bit by bit until it eventually resembled Max's. I learned Spanish Sahara by heart and played it non-stop on the ukulele I begged my parents to buy. Even the wall of my room was decorated in Max's style – a tradition I carry to all the homes, or the resemblance of homes, I've changed along the way. In 11th grade, I made Max’s journal from scratch, it was one of my favorite pieces in the room, taking a notable place among my own personal and school diaries. I remember playing the 4th episode on a school week until 6am and going straight to school all hyped and simultaneously out of it. When Episode 5 came out, I sobbed for two weeks! My best friend at that time and I woke up so early that day, purposefully missed school, and spent all day immersed in that final chapter – her watching a live stream and I cursing at my old computer unable to handle Max’s time jumping shenanigans; of course, taking occasional breaks for comparing our declining emotional stability. [i]Life is Strange[/i] carried me from that final school year straight to University, helping me figure out some stuff about my own life along the way; as it did to many. Every time I turn it on now it just turns into a crying fest. From love, of course. But also sorrow.

Over the years, I’ve read so many players' intimate recollections prompted by the game's content; random snippets of people’s most vulnerable life stories sprinkled over each social media platform. Simply something awoken in people of all ages and backgrounds, perhaps by the game’s mellow nostalgic aesthetics and unabashed willingness to attune to the finest memories and emotions of our hearts. It was rather pleasant to witness the resurgence of [i]LiS[/i] fandom in late 2024, collectively reminiscing on our intimate interaction with the story, the newfound change in perspectives, and the passionate desire to mutually share all the warmth we still have for its characters. 

Living through Max was foundational for me, a self-conscious girl growing into confident adulthood with innocence violently ripped away from her. It was simply an average coming-of-age process, growing up and seeing a world from a different perspective, learning to connect and empathize with those around, learning from them and finding our own flaws and desires, recognizing them and growing to be better. But also a darker experience of going through my own sexual assault, of losing my own innocence, shifting and modifying the self to perhaps be more cynical and pragmatic, of maybe seeing the world through a darker yet necessary lens. Yet, ultimately, all of it forming one unified identity that is nevertheless a beautiful landscape of variable experiences and lessons; adulthood. I will always love the character of Max dearly. I will always cry noticing the gradual change of her vibrant diary doodles to objective, subdued in color entries with each passing chapter. I will always cry for the innocent love Max finds in non-innocent circumstances. The exploration of Max’s fractured mind following the violation will always mean the world to me, back in 2015 making me feel seen and motivated to start my own tumultuous journey of healing. I will always be grateful for Don’t Nod creating this beloved gamified companion to project our own internal worries onto, our transformations, and dreams; to reach intimate answers through a bittersweet, meditative experience.

[i]Life is Strange[/i] maintains sheer gratitude and wonder for each part of our environment while not rejecting the truth of the shadows stretching over the world’s corners. Finding beauty in the industrial powers of small towns, their nature, expansion in infrastructure, transformation of beliefs, unique differing people, and their interconnected messy ties to each other: as colleagues, students, friends, lovers. Finding beauty in the contrast of lives cut short, resentments, domestic disputes, destructive truths, violence, and uncertainty of tomorrow. Creating a living, breathing town that wishes to continuously evolve, grow, and adapt to the changing population making up its geographical landscape. Rachel Amber’s character is perhaps the most compassionate interpretation of Laura Palmer’s image I have seen, Chloe’s uncensored journey of clawing through grief calls to the most helpless moments of my own 19old self, and the understanding of violence captured in a human-shaped form still wounds me deeply: of course, so much of [i]LiS[/i] was inspired by and carried love for David Lynch’s legacy.


It's not so much the content of media; over time it becomes something bigger than its key narrative points. Rather, the events it accompanied in life, the memories you associate it with. That's when stories become truly dear to the heart no matter the years passed. It simply evokes a subdued feeling, like a thread granting the privilege to time travel to your own thoughts, memories, tastes, smells, relationships, places.

I tried replaying this game in so many locations now it can be drawn onto a map, like a shi+ty road trip. But I never lasted very long, about 30 minutes before I lose my cool completely and start thinking of the hand-drawn picturesque walls of my school. Of the captured memories sprinkled over my walls. Of the path to my home from school, from my friends, from the center, from my mom's job, from the park, from the waterfront. Of the last school days and giving away my books. Of getting closer with my classmates and finally understanding how similar we are. Of looking out my window, the windows of my friends, the windows of my school – and seeing sunsets, sunrises, golden hours, whirlwinds, blizzards, screeching hot days. Of dark days. Of town spots I avoid. Of town spots I wish could stay with me. A living breathing town… trapped in hazy, fleeting pieces of memory. Out of reach, a resemblance of something that used to be, overwritten by new places and people – when it's one of the last anchors you have to that past you cannot go back to. Learning to hold the value of delicate memory, accept darkness, and cherish its lighter undertones.

Finally replaying the game after these years, I’ve been finding new connections with Arcadia Bay, of the radical shift it makes from a nostalgic warm town to a harbor of ruin. How it strongly encompasses both, yet neither. I’ve been thinking of how the geography of my town has been modified, its prior identity forever wiped away. I’ve been countering the grief of losing childhood physically and emotionally with the fleeting traces of glee that used to be. On dark days, I will always hold on to the memory of sitting on the hot-to-the-touch boulder stone with my childhood friend, giggling about our new life developments, surrounded by forestry of a quiet park and bright sun. Of looking around me and seeing kids become more expressive in their identities, unafraid to look, think, and love however they please. Of regularly visiting my school and checking in to see if the asphalt drawing we made in dedication to our class teacher has faded away, or the chamomiles covering the school’s entrance are still greeting the children. Of peaking outside from the large plants covering my mom’s windowsill and seeing the rose we have planted outside slowly rise and bloom. Of always having a prepared 2h15m playlist to accompany me on the trip to my town from the nearby big city.

Nowadays, [i]Life is Strange[/i] transports me to the hot summer days of my home. 
I will always be grateful for having a chance to time travel. | Absolutely incredible story. 10/10
Also runs on a potato so that's nice. | I've been wondering for a long time whether ""Life is Strange"" is a game I could recommend or not, since it has very positive reviews and a slew of fans. I also expected such an experience. Unfortunately, I have to admit that the game disappointed me. Don't get me wrong, I fell in love with the demo version (chapter one), which promised an elaborate crime story with several suspects and lots of decision-making. We were introduced to the characters along with our heroine (Max), as she was new to the school. It promised a story full of excitement, mystery and consequences of our choices.

Unfortunately, after purchasing the full version of the game, with all the chapters (21 hours played), the spell faded in several different ways:

1. The game turned out to be a delusion of the consequences of the choices (except for the final decision at the end - although this one is disappointing in terms of the logic of the choice and the realization of the consequences, especially in the case of one final).
 
2. The game deliberately distracts us from some characters, completely forgetting them as criminal suspects. Because of this, we are unable to gather evidence in their case. Which is then supposed to cause surprise, shock, etc. - A cheap, ineffective ploy.

3. Overly cinematic final chapters. At one point in the game, there was so much story told in interludes and stills that for most of the chapter, the player had nothing to do but minor linear activities that contributed nothing. This killed my immersion and and even more my sense of control and decision-making.

4. Little bugs. The ending cutscenes have a number of close-ups of characters talking without their mouths moving. There are so many of them that at some point it becomes uncomfortable. The time reversal system is also sometimes unintuitive and can erase a decision even though it was not intended.

**[Warning: little spoilers]**

5. Final decisions: It is supposed to arouse emotions, but whether it does so is not necessarily the case. The first ending looks good and emotional, but the second one is dull and bland. In addition, it shows that everything we did throughout the game is irrelevant to our protagonist Max (all the friendships we've made, the lives we saved, etc.). That's not how you write good endings.

6. Imbalance in the characterization of the characters. Just as most of the characters are good written (they have their own motives, secrets, behaviors and are believable), I cannot say the same about two of the main characters who should arouse sympathy - Chloe and (maybe) Warren.
The friendship between Max and Chloe is, in my opinion, completely one-sided. Chloe uses Max's skills like a toy, she doesn't accept criticism, she's explosive and I didn't get the impression that she actually cared about her friend or even respected her, her character and way of being. Thus, he forces her to engage in various activities, even though Max points out that such activities are not to her liking or even can hurt her. Despite this, Max keeps repeating wonderful words about lifelong friendship and can also create a love bond with her. The only positive aspect of Chloe's character is at the end, when she realizes all these elements and talks about them, and makes her first unselfish decision.
As for Warren, he's written strangely. He's supposed to be a geek with a crush on Max, and he basically is, but throughout the entire game I had the impression that there was something strange about him and that he was hiding something. | [i]Life is Strange[/i] is a game that focuses on realistic storytelling. The voice acting is impeccable, which is impressive because there are some very emotional scenes, the motion-captured animations are on point, and environments look like someone's drawing of real locations. Even though a large part of the soundtrack consists of licensed songs, it fits perfectly with the place and mood of the story. it's almost like the songs were written for this game. Every character, even side characters, is so real, it's impossible to not feel anything for them.

[i]Life is Strange[/i] isn't a game you just play, it's a highly traumatic life experience you go through. You don't come out the same person afterwards. It's one of those games that makes you interrogate your own decisions in life.

And I want to add that the nightmare scene was one of the coolest horror experience I've ever had, and it managed to do that without using jump scares or other cheap things like hazy environments. And I'm someone who doesn't like horror.

Happy 10th anniversary to LiS!! | This is one of the best video game stories ever told – a true classic. If you haven’t played it yet, make sure to carve out some time for it; it’s totally worth it!

Oh my [b]GOD[/b] some of these fish have absurd catch requirements! Got a real good shock when I first got my bait stolen by the [spoiler]dragon[/spoiler] lol. There are even secret fish and fish that can only spawn on certain days.

I cannot recommend this game enough for the price, It's enjoyable, has a deceptively high skill ceiling in realism mode, and can easily offer more than a dozen hours of playtime if you commit yourself to catching as many fish as you can.

My biggest piece of advice to anyone new: start doing as many quests as you can as soon as you get them. I made the mistake of ignoring them until level 40 or so and now I'm stuck having to grind quests for fish that are VERY difficult to catch lmao.

There's also a dedicated wiki for the game, though I do not recommend you look through it until you at least get the opportunity to get jumpscared a few times by some of the bigger fish in the game (I had some surprises ruined for me after wiki diving and I'm kinda sad about it lol). Honestly, using the wiki IS practically necessary in order to figure out how to catch some of the fish. Like I said before, some of these fish have extremely specific things that you have to do to catch them.

All in all, this game was an EXTREMELY pleasant surprise, considering I got it for so cheap. If you like fishing, hooking what might as well be elder gods, and cats, I HIGHLY recommend this game! | jogo super criativo, ajuda a estimular o raciocínio lógico dando simples lições de como capturar cada peixe. super recomendo!! | Soothing in every single way. Do wish it could true full screen, but other than that extremely minor inconvenience I friggen love it. | i love fishing games and cats so i wanted so badly to like this game but immediately was put off by the over simplified yet difficult mechanics, big fish often swoop in fast and steal your bait or eat you fish before you can reel it in and a lot of the time you accidentally click to sell and end up casting the fish back turning it into bait you cannot sell. and when you cast the big bait to try catch a bigger fish, you have to wait for it to sink past allllll the little fish which will always eat it before it gets too far. THEN that's when the big fish comes and eats your catch. this is a game more suited for cool math games, so if it's on discount try it you might like it. | Very chill (as long as you don't try too hard when certain fish give you trouble), pleasant looping music, a cat obviously, quite a big variety of fish to catch, a nice upgrade system, overall a catchy yet simple game, easy time sinker, worth it

76561198041304371,266510,Hand of Fate,9.4,"Action, Indie, RPG",14,"As with HoF2, Hand of Fate delivers an unprecedented and unique mix between deckbuilder, dungeon crawler, and action RPG. Also as with HoF2, there are glaring flaws in the implementation of mechanics, this time particularly with the Chance Card game and the action RPG combat itself.  
My issue with the Chance Cards is that it is the only minigame you have available to you. HoF2 rectifies this by introducing several others that aren't almost entirely RNG or perception-based: some moreso, some less so, but it all balances out. You also have a greater variety of equipment for dealing with or ""gaming"" certain minigame types. Hand of Fate has maybe two pieces of equipment that will help contribute to your success at Chance Cards.  
The action RPG combat is by far the WORST part of the game. While it's fluid and more dynamic (more options) in HoF2, HoF's combat is plagued by HORRIBLE camera movement and maneuverability of character. Too many times have I gotten stuck on a piece of terrain, surrounded by multiple enemies, and stunlocked by unavoidable attacks. On top of that, enemy HP feels much tankier than HoF2, which draws out combat encounters long enough that I began to feel the game was no longer respecting my time.  
Altogether, at this point in the game's life, I would have to say skip this one and try out HoF2 instead. While that entry has its own share of problematic features, they are not insurmountable, and the breadth of equipment and card types available allow you to take a more tailored approach towards the game's various encounters and challenges.  
Edit: Another thing I wanted to touch on is how some of the token chains for encounter cards feel REALLY unbalanced, requiring you to either repeatedly draw and complete the card's challenge with increasing requirements AND harder Chance Cards, or complete at least three Chance Card challenges with success or Huge Success. This is frustrating and a huge turn-off, but what I've come to understand is Defiant Development LOVES implementing things like this, as they were complained about also by users when HoF2 was fresh, and some things had to be nerfed. Engage with these cards at your own risk of sanity. | O jogo em si é bem legal, Já a platina é cansativa pra porra | очень интересная задумка, хорошая реализация, но ты умрёшь. тебя убьёт либо тупость героя, когда вместо того, чтобы атаковать стоящего рядом врага, герой начнёт давать пощёчины лежащему телу, пока ему уже летит топор, чтобы расколоть пустую черепушку, либо голод , потому что толпа крестьян не взяла половину еды и забрала всё, харкнув тебе в рожу, или же ты умрёшь чисто по приколу, потому что  тебе из-за экрана кинули сквозь тела стоящих противников нож, который ты не смог парировать, ведь щит у тебя слямзили два события назад , когда ты бухал с очень сильной, очень независимой, но очень несчастной алкоголичкой | 옛날 게임이라 비추

 | Great game! It definitely exceeded my expectations and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys space-esque world exploration. I'd give it a solid 8.5/10. | This game is fun, pleasant and have great aesthetics. 
You have many options to build and customize your base, and it is fun to explore the different planets on the solar system. 
I would definitely recommend to play it coop with your friends, there is where this game really shines! | Great game in many regards, but several mechanics and simple bugs make this game extremely agitating to play. I have two different saves that I played through at different times. The most recent I abandoned due to losing a rover loaded with valuable resources due to a known and somewhat common bug where terrain doesn't really load in properly.

A great concept, but the overall style and demeanor has pushed me away significantly."

As you progress in the campaign the game becomes more about splitting hairs that creativity. Each bridge needs to be built more accurately than the last. Then after each failed attempt you move one or two nodes by one or two spaces over and over until one iteration finally lasts and then you don't even feel satisfied."

Hollow Knight is a game that truly embodies the spirit of adventure and discovery. Its [b]smooth and non-linear gameplay[/b] offers players the freedom to explore at their own pace, uncovering multiple side-quests and hidden paths. Every moment spent in the world of Hallownest feels deliberate, as the game masterfully rewards exploration with meaningful upgrades and utilities like charms, keeping you hooked as you uncover its many secrets.
[h2][b]The worldbuilding:[/b][/h2]
It's one of the game's standout features. Hallownest is a place teeming with history, packed with secrets that not only reward the player mechanically but also deepen their understanding of a kingdom that was once prosperous but has since fallen into ruin. The [b]art style[/b] is breathtakingly unique, conveying an emotional story through its hauntingly beautiful environments and designs. It’s not just a backdrop—it’s part of the narrative, pulling you into the melancholic beauty of the world.
[h2][b]The NPCs:[/b][/h2]
They are memorable and fully fleshed out, each with their own personalities and backstories. They add depth and life to the world, making every interaction meaningful.

Whether you’re in it for the challenge, the story, or the thrill of exploration, Hollow Knight delivers on all fronts. It’s a game that doesn’t just tell a story—it lets you live it.
 | 初入圣巢，所见非形。荒废四现，疯虫并行。破败山水，惨戚魂灵。何有此景？心有疑情。游之既远，疑窦始清。皇击辐光，器不容情。功亏一篑，幽而复明。一虫一钉，亦战亦停。所战无由，所停无始。我来尚糜，我去已靖。辐光既治，虚空为心。何为空洞？无心无灵。春秋知罪，天地感型。于斯言之，感慨莫名。 | [h3]GİRİŞ[/h3]
Kısaca “Metroidvania” olarak tanımlanan bu oyun türünde, birbiri içine geçmiş küçük haritaların oluşturduğu devasa bir oyun alanı bulunur. Oyuna başladığınızda pek çok noktaya ulaşamadığınızı fark edersiniz ve oyunda ilerledikçe edindiğiniz özellikler sayesinde geri dönüp bu noktalara erişebilir hale gelirsiniz. Birbirinden alakasız görünen sayısız lokasyon kısa yollarla birleşir, bazen final noktasının başlangıç yerinden iki adım ötede karşımıza çıktığı bile olur. İşte Hollow Knight, bu iki nevi şahsına münhasır oyun türünü tek bir potada birleştiren ve bunu da kusursuz bir şekilde yapan bir oyun.

Hollow Knight giden kimsenin geri dönmediği, bünyesinde sayısız gizem barındıran topraklarda geçen bir böcek oyunu. Evet, kulağa saçma geldiğinin farkındayım ancak ön yargılarınızın sizi ele geçirmesine izin vermeyin. Zira en ufak ayrıntısına kadar ince ince işlenmiş, içeriğinde hiçbir tutarsızlık barındırmayan bir dünya aynı zamanda bu. Gerçekten de uzaklarda bir yerlerde, kurumuş toprakların altında böceklerin buna benzer bir şeylerle uğraşabileceğini düşündürüyor insana.

[h3]HARİTA DEDİĞİN BÖYLE TASARLANIR[/h3]
Oyunda çok fazla farklı bölge bulunuyor ve bu bölgelerin tamamı birbiriyle hiç alakası olmayan temalara sahip. Bir yerde yeşilin her tonu etrafınızı sarmalarken, başka bir yerde bal peteklerinin arasında vızıltılar eşliğinde koşturuyorsunuz. Bu temasal farklılıklar, oyun dünyasına ve o bölgenin böceklerine muazzam bir şekilde yedirilmiş. İlk başta anlamıyorsunuz ama oyunda ilerledikçe görüyorsunuz ki, bu bölgelerin tamamı ders niteliğinde bir ustalıkla birbirine bağlanmış durumda. Hollow Knight, bugüne dek gördüğümüz en iyi harita tasarımına sahip oyunlardan diyebiliriz. 

[h3]GRAFİKLER VE MÜZİKLER[/h3]
Ve tam da bu noktada devreye giren o grafikler ve müzikler… Tamamı el çizimi olan grafikler hem o kadar tatlı, hem de tüm duyguları yansıtabilme noktasında o kadar başarılı ki. Özellikle iki boyutlu bir dünyayı dolu dolu yansıtabilmek adına sadece arka planı değil, ekrana doğru üçüncü bir düzlemi de tasarlamış olmaları çok güzel bir detay. Sağa sola koştururken, bir anda ekranın önünden silüet halinde hızla geçen bir böcek görmek, kesinlikle atmosferin içine daha fazla girmenizi sağlıyor. Lakin oyunun grafiklerinden daha iyi olan bir şeyi varsa, o da müzikleri. Yani oyunun görselliği ve müzikleri o kadar iyi ki; Dark Souls’tan hatıra öldüğünde ruhunu gidip geri alma veya birbirinden ilgi çekici boss dövüşleri gibi oynanış mekaniklerinden konuşasım bile gelmiyor (ki oyun bunları da çok iyi bir şekilde yapıyor). 

[h3]GÖZDEN KAÇIRAYIM DEMEYİN![/h3]
%90 üzeri bir tamamlama yüzdesi için 30 ila 40 saat arası bir oyun süresi ayırmanız gerekiyor ki Hollow Knight gibi bir platform oyunu için bu hiç de fena olmayan bir içerik anlamına geliyor. Elbette oyunun yapısı gereği bol bol eski bölgelere geri dönmeniz ve geçtiğiniz yerlerden tekrar tekrar geçmeniz şart ancak Hollow Knight, bir an olsun bunları yaparken sıkılmanıza müsaade etmiyor. | Когда я начал играть у меня были огромные ожидания.

[b]Thank you for taking the time to read and think about this review.[/b]
[hr][/hr] | [h1]The Game[/h1]
A game that should only be played once. A game that discovers the problem of a normal human mind. A game that reflects our real world.

[h1]The Story[/h1]
The story this game tells is of guilt, sorrow and loss. This story can only be felt by interacting with it. This story can not be told by any other media. 

[h1]The Unsatisfactory Ending[/h1]
The ending if this game is so unsatisfactory that it pulls you out of itself to let you think about your own life. I play games to unwind and relax, to forget my own problems and struggles but this game just reflected that back to me. The thing from which I tried to run away was thrown back at me. There was no happy end to this story, yet it makes you feel at ease after completing. 

[h1]Final Thought[/h1]
Firewatch tells a story that has never been and will never be told by any other media. The story which connects our real lives to the lives of Henry and Delilah. The guilt felt by Ned is felt by the player. This game is too complex or rather I should say that the human mind is too complex to describe in words. | Para quienes no saben que es, Firewatch es un Walking simulator que dura unas 4 horas de mundo abierto donde seremos un vigilante contra incendios y que tiene un gran enfasis en la narrativa y la inmersión. Más que un juego es una experiencia como puede serlo un pelicula.

Lo mejor del juego es sin duda la narrativa, la atmosfera y los personajes, el doblaje (en ingles) es muy muy bueno, los personajes se sienten muy naturales, reales y organicos. En cuanto a la trama, considero que esta muy bien llevada y es muy interesante durante gran parte del juego, quizás lo unico pólemico, es el final, que o bien te gusta y quizas incluso te haga replantearte cosas o quizás te deje un poco frio. En mi caso el final me ha dejado un poco frio, pero considero que el recorrido hasta llegar ahi ha sido muy muy bueno.

Lo peor del juego: las mecanicas de movimiento y salto no estan nada pulidas, el personaje tiene a veces a quedarse trabado y a tener fallos en algunas animaciones, aunque no es grave, en un juego donde la inmersion es tan importante le quita puntos y te puede sacar un poco de la experiencia.

En conclusión: Lo recomiendo? Si, si te gustan los walking simulators y buscas una muy buena experiencia narrativa, Firewatch te la va a dar. Si nunca has jugado a un walking simulator pero te gusta disfrutar de una buena historia, tambien lo recomiendo siempre y cuando vengas con la mentalidad de que estas disfrutando de una experiencia narrativa y no de un juego al uso. | [h1][b][i] UNA BREVE PERO HERMOSA EXPERIENCIA [/i][/b][/h1]

Firewatch era otro de los tantos juegos que tenia pendiente y que me arrepiento un poco el haber tardado en darle una oportunidad, ya que en la pocas horas que tiene de duración, podremos disfrutar de una hermosa experiencia jugable tanto en lo visual como en lo bien lograda que esta su narrativa y desarrollo de personajes, aunque con un gameplay bastante simple, hace de este juego uno de los más entrañables que he disfrutado recientemente.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3412209318

Pese a que es un juego bastante simple y sin muchas mecánicas, ya que es básicamente un walking simulator, pero pese a esto es un juego que se disfruta en todo momento. Todo esto porque a primera vista se puede apreciar la mejor carta de presentación de Firewatch, ese estilo gráfico tan precioso y la ambientación tan bien conseguida. Durante las horas que dura la aventura, nos encontraremos explorando los rincones de ese precioso bosque y ríos montañosos tan bien diseñados y sobretodo, el gran trabajo en la iluminación que presentan cada uno de los rincones de su mapa. No solo la parte gráfica logra esta gran sensación, el apartado sonoro también esta tan bien trabajado con esos sonidos ambientales que iremos apreciando , haciendo de la exploración de este juego algo hermoso, haciendo que aveces no avance en la historia y que me hubiera gustado que la misma durara un poco más.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3412732211

Por otra parte su historia, pero sobretodo su narrativa, me parecieron de lo más particular e interesante. Desde el inicio nos dan un contexto general sobre el presente de nuestro protagonista y el porque acabo en el trabajo de guardaparques, lo que a partir de ahí nos lleva a entablar un curiosa relación con la supervisora del lugar. En ese momento la historia se desarrolla por medio de conversaciones cortas en diferentes situaciones o por cosas que podremos ir encontrando por el mapa, y donde podremos ver mejor la personalidad y desarrollo de ambos personajes, en especial la de nuestro protagonista, el cual afectado por su pasado, intenta sobrellevar una nueva vida. A la par de los personajes, también esta su historia, muy interesante y que esconde un misterio, el cual termina siendo el eje principal de la trama, con varias partes llenas de suspenso e intriga, y que nos tocara el trabajo de investigar. Aunque quizás la duración no daba para más la duración, esos saltos de tiempo que da en algunos momentos nunca me terminan de gustar y tal vez así hubiéramos obtenido algo más de duración.

[*]De lo poco malo que puedo encontrarle es que no me terminan de gustar esos saltos de tiempo que da la historia, y aunque la misma no daba para tanto, si que la sentí un poco corta.

[/list]

Firewatch es un juego totalmente recomendado, que a muchos les gustara y que se puede completar en una tarde, pero que pese a lo corto que es, todo lo bueno que ofrece lo compensa por completo y aplaudir el gran trabajo, y cariño que le han puesto sus desarrolladores. 
Aunque ahora son parte de Valve y no han vuelto a pronunciar nada de su próximo juego, tengo la esperanza de que en algún momento inesperado sean capaces de lanzarlo y así volver a vivir una experiencia similar. | Одно из лучших приключений, что я играл. 

Плюсы: 
Отличная визуальная часть;
Хорошо прописанный и захватывающий вашу голову сюжет как в добротном триллере (отсутствие сценарных и геймплейных банальностей);
Весь саунд проработан отлично; 
Нет бессмысленных действий, что ведут к растягиванию сюжета и океаны воды;
Никаких багов (нынче это так же отдельный плюс);
Достаточно легкий, но при этом подходящий данной игре геймплей;
Диалоги построены изумительно; 
Технически игра на очень высоком уровне на момент написания этого обзора. 

Минусы:
Для себя я их просто не нашел. 

Спасибо разработчику за игру и хорошо проработанную трогательную историю. 

Однозначно рекомендую к прохождению!

只要手柄够多 就不怕熊孩子乱闹腾 | Ultimate Chicken Horse — это, по сути, симулятор того, как дружба медленно, но верно превращается в ненависть, обиды и безумный смех. Начинается всё весело: выбираешь своего милого зверька, прыгаешь по платформам, строишь уровень с друзьями. Но через 10 минут я, играя за курицу, уже ставил смертоносные ловушки, лишь бы мой друг-конь понял, как низко он пал, когда поставил вращающуюся пилу прямо перед финишем.

Эта игра — идеальное место для садистов. Хотите установить пружину перед пропастью, чтобы всех выкидывало в бездну? Или может быть, добавить липкие шипы к единственной лестнице? Вариантов миллион. Самое главное — делать вид, что вы ни при чём: ""Ой, это кто поставил гигантский шар с шипами? Наверное, случайно получилось!""

Казалось бы, простая цель: добраться до финиша. Но нет. Каждый игрок — мастер саботажа. Уровень быстро превращается в поле для пыток, где победить могут только самые ловкие, хитрые… или просто самые наглые. Один раз друг построил мост, а потом добавил на него 5 пчелиных ульев. Говорит, ""Это для атмосферы"". Я до сих пор не могу смотреть на пчёл без внутренней дрожи.

Самое лучшее — это момент, когда ты побеждаешь в адском уровне, который сам же и построил. Сидишь, гордо глядя на экран, а друзья кидаются на тебя словами, которые лучше не упоминать здесь. Если у вас нет токсичных друзей, не переживайте — эта игра их вам сделает.

Ultimate Chicken Horse — это смесь платформера, хоррора и жёсткого урока о том, что с друзьями нельзя расслабляться. 10/10. Идите, стройте уровень, и пусть ваши отношения трещат по швам. | 真的太爱这款游戏了！玩法丰富多样，能满足不同玩家的需求。不管是喜欢策略的，还是热衷冒险的，都能在里面找到乐趣。游戏画面精美绝伦，光影效果处理得恰到好处，感觉就像在看一场视觉盛宴。而且游戏的社交系统也很棒，能认识好多志同道合的小伙伴，一起组队开黑超快乐！必须给个好评！"

Going into this game, I didn't really have any expectations, I only knew it from gaming youtubers of the past generation (pewdiepie etc.,) so I knew that it is popular, but did not have any idea on what to expect from the game, played it without seeing any description, screenshots, nor reviews. Turns out, up to this date, it is still the most enjoyable game I've ever played and I'll forever be a fan of such a wonderful piece of artwork in the gaming community. | ""Undertale! O RPG onde você não precisa matar ninguém.""
A própria sinopse do jogo demonstra o quão revolucionário e diferente esse jogo é.
Undertale sequer é um jogo; Undertale é uma experiência, e para muitos, a melhor experiência audiovisual que tiveram na vida. E eu sou uma dessas pessoas. Undertale, para mim, é um dos melhores jogos indies de todos os tempos. É incrível e inexplicável como esse jogo consegue ser tão bom e tantos aspectos; Undertale tem, possivelmente, uma das melhores trilhas sonoras da história dos videogames, Toby Fox é um verdadeiro artista e suas músicas no jogo conseguem transmitir os mais variados sentimentos; os visuais de Undertale são simples, mas cada pixel nesse jogo é muito bem colocado e feito com muito amor, os personagens tem aparências únicas e marcantes; as mecânicas do jogo são muito bem feitas, os puzzles são simples já que o foco de Undertale são seus diálogos (história) e sua gameplay (batalhas), batalhas essas que são únicas, com cada inimigo tendo seus ataques próprios níveis de dificuldade diferentes; a história é o ponto principal de Undertale, com o jogo tendo três rotas, divididas por Rota Neutra, Rota Pacífica e Rota Genocida, sendo minha preferida, a Rota Pacifista, por ser uma forma de jogar diferente e referente à sinopse, contendo muitas reações e momentos sentimentais, com um final digno de muitas lágrimas, também aprecio muito a Rota Genocída pela sua dificuldade e habilidades necessárias para completar.
Em suma, Undertale é perfeito para quem quer viver uma experiência única, com músicas marcantes, uma história que muda a sua forma de enxergar a vida e uma gameplay que se difere baseado na sua forma de jogar, além dos personagens que são marcantes e carismáticos.
Undertale é único, e todos têm direito de viver a experiência de jogar Undertale.
Recomendo que joguem todas as rotas.

游戏里的屠杀结局，是对人性黑暗面的直白审视。在这个走向里，玩家选择对遇到的怪物赶尽杀绝，每一次攻击都伴随着怪物的痛苦与绝望。游戏画面随着杀戮推进，逐渐染上压抑的色调，音乐也变得扭曲阴森。最终，玩家会面对一个孤独且荒芜的世界，曾经生机勃勃的地下王国沦为死寂废墟，只剩无尽悔恨与空虚。这个结局以极端的方式警示玩家，暴力与冷漠只会带来毁灭，让我们反思自身行为对周围世界的影响。
 
和平路线则截然不同，它是一曲爱与理解的赞歌。玩家摒弃武器，用耐心、真诚与怪物交流，挖掘出每个角色背后温暖人心的故事。游戏氛围也从最初的紧张转为温馨，音乐轻快明亮，充满希望。在这个结局中，玩家不仅化解了怪物与人类之间的千年仇恨，还让地下世界重归安宁与和谐。它向我们展示了善良、包容的力量，让我们坚信爱能跨越一切障碍。
 
中立结局处于二者之间，充满了未知与变数。玩家的每一次抉择都可能改变故事走向，怪物的命运在玩家一念之间或喜或悲。这一结局凸显了游戏的自由与开放，强调玩家的选择具有决定性意义，每个人都能在游戏中书写属于自己的独特篇章。

So, I joined the helldivers during the ""Helldivers 2"" hype, and was deeply encouraged to play this game daily, several hours non-stop. The game presents gameplay, I have never experienced before, especially the hardcore aspects of the game, making every decision count. The variety of equipment and details in game is astonishing for a game, which may not look as ""modern"", but it definitely is a gem.

When playing launching my first missions, the extreme difficulty of the game, like team kill from literally anything (bullets, grenades and even vehicles, which took a while to avoid, XD) at first took some time to adjust, but with some practice it becomes one heck of a fight (especially when you join LVL 12+ missions). The abundance of upgrades and unlocks, motivates the players to keep on playing, as with new attachments you get to experience better and smoother gameplay.

Another thing, is the community, I can swear that I have not seen a community such cooperative and supportive, literally every game with randoms, made me want to add them on, as they helped out a huge bunch during gameplay. I have played a variety of shooters, and knowing human's corrupt mind, every once in a while, you encounter a grief that just doesn't let you enjoy the game. Helldivers is a complete opposite experience, throughout my gameplay, I have never seen players deliberately attempting to fail the mission (besides quitters XD), with every team kill, resulting in an instant recovery, which is a huge thumbs up.

Helldivers will always have a special place in my heart, because the game had delivered every detail perfectly, which I am glad to have experienced! With its cheap price, I'd definitely recommend to consider, even if you do not have friends to play with, this game will get you those friends, trust me! | 很好玩的游戏，虽然过了10年但是现在依旧有很多人，白天晚上都能找到联机房间，非常推荐试试，毕竟豪华版打折才22 | The battles are alow and far apart on the lower difficulty settings but once you hit thr higher levels, the  difficulty is ramped up to crazy proportions.

and ter fact you can jump in on another players game really helps build comradery than anything.

终于在我的不懈努力下，我结婚了，也有了两个可爱的小孩，终于也坐上了前往姜岛的船，遇到了新的朋友。收集完金核桃以后，我在姜岛也安了家，这里风和日丽，阳光正好，很适合度假，偶尔我也会在这里小住几日，可是我知道，鹈鹕镇还有很多人在等我，我放不下他们，最后在我和朋友们的劝导和帮助之下，我内向的新朋友雷欧也在鹈鹕镇安了家。

最后在我们共同的努力下，我在来的鹈鹕镇第七年的最后一天和艾米丽在山顶紧紧相拥，叮咚，Steam跳出了完美的成就，游戏进度也到达了100%，这一切到达了最完美的进度。我退出了游戏，看向窗外的时候，窗外还是阴雨连绵，屋内还是昏黄的灯光，温暖的室温让我依然感到很舒服。只不过，时间已经过去了两年。2024年10月，我的大学生活基本来说已经划上了句号，迎接我的是新的生活和未知，实习、工作、生活的压力越来越大，我感到很迷茫，好像有些事情努力也没有结果，有些人好像怎么送礼物与对话也不会提示好感度……

希望我也会终有一天，听到耳边弹出“完美”成就的声音。

“妈妈，人生要真是星露谷就好了，

随时可以到达的海边，送出礼物就能获得的友谊，付出努力就一定会有收获，失败了也只是掉东西，永远有再来的机会，而且就算什么也不干每天躺在床上评定等级的时候，爷爷也只是希望你远离世俗开开心心。妈妈，人生要真是星露谷就好了，我想有很多很多朋友，想有疼爱我的长辈。种下去就能长出来的菜，放进小桶就能酿出的酒，下雨也可以去海钓一整天的鱼；砍树也是充实的一天。

妈妈，为什么我一直都只是在小房间里打转呢” | [h3] Pontos positivos do jogo: [/h3]

76561198041304371,349040,NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 4,0.6333333333333333,"Action, Adventure",1,"Jogo muito bom, rodou no meu notebook que é muito fraco no minimo
10/10 | Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 is an enjoyable experience, especially for fans of the show. It does a great job of bringing iconic moments to life while offering fun gameplay that’s easy to pick up but hard to master.

Gameplay
The combat is simple yet complete. It’s the kind of system that’s easy to start with but challenging enough to keep you engaged, especially if you’re aiming for those S-ranks. That said, tougher matchups can feel a bit repetitive after a while. As a fan of the anime, I really enjoyed the Ultimate Jutsus and the unique interactions between certain characters—they’re little touches that add a lot of charm.

Story Mode and Narrative
The story mode hits all the big moments from the anime while expanding on some characters in cool ways. It stays true to the source material, with all the ups and downs—from ninjas to superpowers, friendship, and, yeah, aliens. There are also a few fun gameplay twists, like the Susano’o fight that feels like an asteroid game and a Kyubi race that switches things up. It keeps things interesting, even if the narrative progression mirrors the same weird jumps as the original story.

Modes and Variety
There’s a lot to do here. Adventure mode gave me strong vibes of the older Naruto PS2 games, which was a nice throwback. Survival and Challenge modes are exactly what you’d expect, and the variety of characters is impressive. I had fun mixing up my roster, especially with some underrated and lesser-known picks. There are also some costumes and funny customizations that make battles even more entertaining.

Visuals and Sound
The graphics have aged well, and everything still looks great during the intense fights. However, the lack of ultrawide support and occasional FPS drops do stand out, though they’re not game-breaking. The soundtrack and effects are classic Naruto, pulling heavily from the show and earlier games, which makes the experience even more nostalgic.

Accessibility and Value
The difficulty ramps up as you go, but it’s never frustrating. The challenge mostly comes from enemies hitting harder and having more health rather than smarter AI, so it’s manageable. I didn’t try multiplayer—it’s not my style—but the single-player content is more than enough. The base game is worth it, especially if you grab it during one of the frequent sales.

Final Thoughts
This game is pure nostalgia in the best way. It mixes beloved characters with underrated ones and delivers an experience that feels faithful to the show. The gameplay is fun and engaging without being overly difficult, and the story elements are well-represented with solid visuals and sound. If you’re a fan of the series or just want a fun fighting game, it’s worth a shot—especially on sale.

Score: 8/10
Recommendation: A great pick for fans of the show. Keep an eye out for discounts! | 客观评价来说，释放技能前后摇以及普工僵直太严重，这么长时间的真空期很容易被手快的人物针对，打个比方来说，用白面具释放技能太慢还容易放空，对方很容易蓄力突脸进行连击，其次就是普工A完后，人物会站在原地一小段时间，还有就是平A不能及时打断，自己已经取消平A了，人物还是会进行下一段攻击，感觉比不上国内的火影手游，虽然手游没法和这个做比较，但是手游上的技能释放和普工平A手感还是把控的很好的。 | 《火影忍者》漫画最终 章为蓝本，融合剧场版剧情，从斑和柱间 大战开始， 横跨第四次忍界大战， 涵盖鸣 人当上火影等情节， 还有木叶新绿篇等，剧情这块还原度还是挺高的。 | 总体还算挺好玩，本人steam上面的第一个游戏。剧情方面就是原汁原味的火影忍者疾风传剧情，并且制作组还加了许多小细节，使得剧情的情感表达和画面冲击更上一层楼（特别是八门凯的震撼和最后鸣佐大战的穿插回忆，个人感觉都非常新颖，让人眼前一亮）。剧情和战斗相结合，玩家的体验感也是非常足的，可以体会到制作组对火影这部作品的热爱和游戏剧情设计方面的用心。
接下来说为什么少打一星，因为游戏的缺点也有一些。比如有一些关卡有很长且不能跳过的剧情部分，偏偏这些关卡对S等级的判定还是偏执般的严格……我承认剧情演出的优秀，但是这也导致了刷一些关卡的S成就非常耗时间；联机匹配不到人（不知道是不是人在内地的原因），自由对战模式打了几局下来捡几个成就，体验体验角色就玩腻了，导致游戏除了剧情模式之外的部分过于单调，缺乏可玩性；剧情通关之后的干杂活任务太无聊并且机制有些奇怪？反正本人不太喜欢…
博人传DLC嘛…差强人意，和疾风传剧情的模式差不多，鸣佐战桃式那里挺不错的，还原了博人传剧场版的观感。
总之，游戏总体上还是瑕不掩瑜。本人是火影的老漫迷了，有这样一款游戏来支撑火影的IP也是非常棒的，让我体会到了对于火影漫画内容的很多不一样的表现形式～（所以隔壁死神什么时候出一款对标终极风暴的游戏啊啊啊）"

It runs well on my non-gaming laptop, too,  which is great since I have to stream most of my Steam games from my desktop and can't play them when I'm travelling. There's some combat with ""biters"" which come and destroy all your hard work but be aware there's a setting to turn that way down if you prefer to focus on the builds as I do. This thing is a very entertaining but very deep black hole! | Never having sales is stupid but this game gets away with it by actually being worth the full pricetag, including with the DLC 

I never thought I'd say ""yeah, 64€ for a factory sim is worth it"" but lo' and behold this is of higher quality than most modern releases in the videogame industry and you can and will have high quality content for hundreds of hours

My biggest issue is that base game content is a bit lacking, the DLC fixes that problem however
Also ingame mod support? That doesn't require third party websites? in the 21st century?
If anything it pisses me off because of how this should be in every game with a modding scene

Whatever go my drones | 因为你们这个混蛋制作组站在了法西斯的阵营，无缘无故将价格翻了两倍来恶心中国玩家，对俄罗斯翻了10倍，对以色列等发动战争的国家却熟视无睹，游戏是好游戏，但我不推荐你们玩这样一个意识不正确的制作组发行的游戏。

Если эта игра так хороша, то что там в БГ3 -- страшно представить. Это 9 из 10 | 非常不错的游戏，算是我玩过的这类型的第一部作品，百小时的流程，从过年前一两天开始玩，连着几天都有熬到凌晨，今天凌晨一点通关，玩完有一点怅然若失。
我选的是伊凡，一个老男人，选的职业是亡灵法师。在欢乐堡组了个了四人小队，女精灵希贝尔，女歌手洛思，男矮人比斯特。犹记得序章的船上大家萍水相逢，各怀心事，好不寡淡。我也只是怀着游戏心情，全然忘了角色过往的深仇大恨，单纯体验着旁观者的乐趣与未曾接触过的游玩方式。后来在欢乐堡与希贝尔的相遇又是那么惊艳，又惊又艳，一根锐针抵住我的咽喉，一番交涉她加入了我的队伍，在交涉中我给她的定位是肉装战士，特意调了个与我直觉中精灵印象相反的形象，正如我自己一开始选职业时，逆着自己对圣骑士的理想选了个亡灵法师，因为我想竟然已经在玩游戏了，不妨不要那么刻板，难道就不能有一个一身正气的亡灵法师吗，另一方面我图的是亡灵法师的肉团操控可以免于孤军奋战，我那时还不知道有孤狼的打法。在人多力量大的思想引号下，队伍有收了法师洛思，近战法师比斯特，这全是按照我自己对战斗的设想来与他们交涉选的定位。
队伍成了，本来还有预想着到后面换个队友试试的，因为洛思看起来身体里有什么邪恶的东西，而矮人我又实在不喜欢，唯有精灵或许我还挺喜欢，不过她似乎有着一系列的解决目标。可是随着冒险的的推进，我对队伍里的人逐渐积累了感情后又不舍得换了。印象最深刻的一次战斗是拿了传送手套后到处乱穿，想着从欢乐堡的港口绕过去，结果一进去一大片红点，而当时我还不怎么存档，回退的话与上一个档隔得相当远，当时我怀着绝望的心情带领小队迎战一群等级比我高的敌人，边打边往高地退，那时后队伍的主力是我和希贝尔，另外两位在我印象里都是相当的脆。于是我一个人在一边引开部分敌人边吸血边打，希贝尔在高地保护洛思，矮人作为男子汉也给我出来在与我相对的另外一边诱敌。最后发现其实我也没拖住什么敌人，大部分还是往着洛思那冲，然后被希贝尔一个盾牌一个盾牌解决，而比斯特则在对面后排跟法防弱的敌人巅峰对决，整场仗打下来发现竟然只有我的血条还蛮健康，甚至还有点物甲没破，原来队伍里只有我自己摸鱼摸得厉害（笑）。一场越级打怪，使我之后所有的战斗都变得轻松起来。希贝尔在盾牌战士这条路上越走越远，洛思逐渐成为雷电法王，只有比斯特和我两个人不知道在干什么，比斯特的问题是没输出的同时也脆脆的，而我属于是除了死不掉外就没什么优点了。一个队伍愣是让两个姑娘给撑起来了。
后来啊后来，我们走出了欢乐堡，穿越了浮木镇，探索了无名岛，闯荡了阿克城。希贝尔摧毁了母树，获得了真正的自由；洛思打败了医生，一首Sing for me；比斯特成了阿克斯城第一弓弩手（笑）；而我嘛，嘿嘿，希贝尔成了我的爱人，我还要忙着照顾队友呢，洛思还是不能让我放心，打败恶魔任重道远。
我存档体验了三个结局，神谕者结局，分享秘源结局，清除秘源结局。只能说无论如何，我还是更在乎我那几个故事永远在进行着的队友啊。估计很久我都不会再玩这个游戏了，结局要让它更像个伙伴再叙有望的结局，故事让它永远都是意犹未尽的故事。 | Good Pure RPG game which has good world building, Good characters, decent class variability expecially for the magical school variants. For fans of rpgs and tactical turn based combat a definitive win. For the game mechanics for me the importance and insistance on magical&physical armour making it that your phys char (mailny played lone wolf)has to solo certain targets that have their phys armour down and my magical based buddy cant help because they have heaps of magical armor so magic cant cc them was a downside.

Great game, but for me most of the weakneses are majorly updated for Baldurs Gate III, which if you are looking to play or try just one RPG High fantasy game w turn based combat go with BG3. If you like come back DOSII.

러스티 레이크 호텔은 그 유명한 러스티 레이크 시리즈의 게임 중 하나로 본 게임은 어느 호텔에 들어온 동물인간을 객실로 모시고 그 이후에 일들에 대해 탐험하는 포인트 앤 클릭 형 퍼즐게임이다.

이번에 러스티레이크 게임을 처음 접했는데, 생각보다 게임이 몰입감도 있고 생각할 거리도 많이 줘서 꽤나 괜찮다고 생각했다.

게임은 로비에서 웰컴드링크를 통해, 5마리(?)의 동물인간들을 객실로 보내고, 각 방에 들어가서 각 동물에 맞는 레시피를 모아서 음식을 만들고, 그 음식을 다른 동물인간들에게 제공하는 방식으로 진행된다. 순서는 랜덤으로 진행해도 상관이 없는데, 특정 순서대로 게임을 진행하면서 모든 요리 평가를 3성으로 클리어시 특별한 번호가 해금된다.

퍼즐의 난이도는 그렇게 높지 않은 편이다. 각각의 퍼즐은 방에 있는 물체와 상호작용, 혹은 동물인간과의 상호작용을 통해서 힌트를 얻고 그 힌트대로 정보를 유추해나가면 클리어할 수 있다. 메인 재료인 고기를 얻기 전까지는 방에서 나가지 못하는데 일종의 방탈출 게임같은 느낌도 받았다. 그리고 마지막까지 게임을 진행하고 얻는 엔딩은, 사실 완전히  이해는 못했지만, 엔딩이 주는 여운은 꽤나 큰편이었다.

난이도도 그렇게 어렵지 않고, 정가 2300원에 1~2시간 정도면 나쁘지 않다고 생각한다. 그리고 포인트 앤 클릭형 게임 중에서 여운도 꽤 주는 편이라 포인트 앤 클릭형 게임이나 킬링타임용으로 즐기기에도 적당하다고 생각한다.

## 단 모든 요리 3성의 경우 공략을 안보면 처음에 얻기 힘들 수 있다. 따라서 한 큐에 도전과제 100%를 달성하고자 한다면 가이드를 보는 것을 추천한다. 필자의 경우 4번째 재료 하나를 놓쳐서 처음부터 다시 플레이했다... | Rusty Lake Hotel is a great puzzle game with well-designed puzzles that balance accessibility and cleverness. For me, this was the game that introduced me to the fascinating Rusty Lake universe. It’s an ideal starting point for anyone new to the series or the creators’ other games.

The game offers more than just puzzles — it’s filled with strange characters and an atmosphere that’s both eerie and captivating. If you’re familiar with the Rusty Lake world, you’ll appreciate the small details for the series that fans will enjoy.

Although the game is relatively short, the price feels fair for what it offers. It may not be the most outstanding value, but the quality and charm make it worthwhile, especially for beginners.

If you're looking for a unique and thrilling puzzle game that combines mystery and charm, Rusty Lake Hotel is a fantastic choice. | The game itself was very dark but also very good.

It's a card game where you play it like a board game and it's up to you to predict what your opponent is going to do and try to react accordingly. 

The most unique part of this game is that you play FOUR cards at ONCE. Every turn, both players! And there's no mana. If that doesn't get you at least interested, I don't know what to say.

People talk about grind in f2p, (which is what put me off of HS) and grind is part of RuneScape, so that label almost put me off of this game. Which I think happened to a lot of people, and that's a shame. 

If you're looking for a fun, free-to-play card game with some twists and isn't a chore, here it is. | C'est dommage ce jeu avait tout pour se démarquer :
- un système de jeu original différent réellement des autres TCG
- une ambiance originale
- des cartes bien équilibrées offrant des possibilités de decks vraiment très nombreuses
- une économie saine pas de pay to win, de vrais boosts réguliers pour les f2p ou juste ceux ne désirant pas lâcher leur salaire tous les mois dans des boosters

Mais :
- Jagex a presque été silencieux depuis le début, et n'a quasiment fait aucune promo, et n'a organisé aucun tournoi (TCG = esport et spectacle en streaming de nos jours, sans ça il y a vraiment une perte de valeur)
- n'a quasiment rien ajouté depuis sa sortie
- a laissé traîné des sales bugs sans s'en occuper et qui au bout d'un an de jeu deviennent plus qu'horripilants
- a fini de tuer ma motivation avec l'ajout de bonus f2p obligeant à se connecter tous les jours sans en rater un seul... (quasiment tous les éditeurs ont compris que les gens avaient une vie à côté des TCG et qu'il pouvait arriver qu'on ne se connecte pas pendant plus de 24h, me^me pour récupérer un bonus... d'autant que ce système à la noix est un système de f2p mobile qui s'y adapte beaucoup car on peut ouvrir ces jeux et récupérer les bonus en speed entre deux portes même si on n'a pas le temps de jouer...)

En gros, pendant longtemps, j'ai recommandé ce jeu, mais aujourd'hui un constat doit être fait...
Le jeu est plus ou moins à l'abandon, la communauté, même si motivée ne fait que rétrécir, et aucun effort ne semble vouloir être fait pour résoudre les anciens bugs et planifier le futur. 
Donc, devant le nombre de TCG de qualité de nos jours, je ne peux pas recommander ce jeu, même si ça me fend le coeur, et moi-même je lui dis Adieu aujourd'hui, le coeur gros du gâchis d'un si bon jeu. | 好游戏，暂时没有遇到网络爆炸，你在发现卡顿了就退出重上就好，不会说中途网络爆炸断线什么的。如果重上卡顿的话。。。找别的游戏玩一下......另外，为啥不能在游戏里充值？！

GOOD GAME, BUT I can't pay in the game( 502 badgateway) #China | I love this game so much. Jagex has been an eh developer in recent years but my love for the Runescape franchise is still sparked. Who needs Hearthstone? Play Chronicle! Its a shame that the player base has dropped in recent months but when I do rarely find someone on Casual its always fun. There are still some cards that are OP (like 2 Surges in a row and certain monsters) but hey its a work in progress.

Solid 8/10
Pros: wide variety of cards/characters
room for improvement and more decks
The strategy is off the chain!

Cons: Matchmaking is sketchy, unless its Ranked
The AI in single player campaign is freaking impossible

Так же стилистика и арт у игры очень приятный, жаль, что студия закрылась C: | Maybe even harder than the first game but equally fun.
It's same feeling as the darkest dungeon franchise - both great games but the common denominator is the brutal degree of difficulty. But since the game is awsome,  and you wanna stay awsome, you muster up even more sisu to face the challenges ahead. And you fail..yet again and again..

4,5 / 5 smashed pc screens
would play again in this or the next life..maybe.

Classic action card-rpg that every fan of the genre must play! | very cool game! this might be the ultimate board game.
Every scenario is unique, and the game throws at you seemingly random chances, but once you understand the little tricks the odds get better | If you like the first one, this one is definitely worth getting

The quests as levels is a nice touch, with other game modes and new equipment and enemies to keep it interesting.

76561198041304371,310380,Unknown,0.3,,0,"Fractured Space ist ein Teambasiertes Moba Spiel welches man vom Grundprinzip her mit LoL,Dota etc. vergleichen kann.
Ich werde nur die positiven und negativen Aspekte aufzählen,wer Infos zum Gameplay haben möchte kann sich die Beschreibung sowie Youtube Videos anschauen.

Pro:
+Open Development
(Die Entwickler befassen sich sehr stark mit den Mitspielern und zeigen ihren Entwicklungsplan offen auf dieser Website https://trello.com/b/pOsdj00F/fractured-space.Dort können Spieler ebenfalls Ideen einbringen und abstimmen welches Feature als nächtes entwickelt werden soll bzw. verbessert.Desweiteren kommen regelmäßig Entwickler auf die Gameserver wo man diese direkt ansprechen kann und aauch immer ein Feedback bekommt.Zusätzlich gibt es einen TS3 Server auf dem des öfteren ein ""Community Day"" abgehalten wird und man sich mit den Entwicklern sogar unterhalten kann,gesprochen wird natürlich nur in English.

+Hübsche Grafik
(Die Unreal Engine 4 bringt in diesem Spiel eine gute Leistung.Licht/Schatten,Effekte sowie Texturen sehen Größtenteils sauber und naja spacig aus^^.)

+Große Auswahl an Schiffen
(Es gibt trotz Early Acess eine Ganze Armada an verschiedenen Schiffen welche sich meistens komplett unterschiedlich spielen und einsetzen lassen.)

+Free to play Model
(Nach der Alpha wird dieses Spiel Free to play und wenn ich dass richtig beurteilen kann dann kein Pay2Win.Man kann sich im moment nur Tarnungen bzw. Skins für seine Schiffe von echten Geld kaufen,den Rest muss man sich erspielen.
Es gibt zwar Premiumschiffe nur sind diese identisch mit ihren normalen Ebenbildern und haben keine erhöten Stats,sondern geben lediglich mehr exp/credits am ende einer Runde)

+Einfache,saubere Steuerung
(Die Steuerung des Schiffes ist ziehmlich simpel gehalten trotzdem können erfahrenere Spieler anspruchsvollere Manöver ausführen als Anfänger.Also kann man sich im Spielstil weiterentwickeln was einen imensen Vorteil in manchen Situationen bringen kann.)

+Startegie Faktor
(Durch die meist langsame Bewegung der Schiffe kann man nicht immer überall sein,so muss man sich überlegen wo man als nächstes hinspringt.Man muss sich oft überlegen ob man im Sektor A bleibt oder doch lieber zu B springt um da weiter zu kommen bzw. zu verteidigen.Es gibt noch viele weitere Faktoren die ich hier nicht aufzählen möchte trd. hat dieses Spiel eine strategische Tiefe die man nicht unbeachtet lassen darf.)

Kontra:

- Bugs,teilweise unbalanciert,Crashes
(Dieses Kontra enpfinde ich als eher nichtig,da dass Spiel sich in einer Alpha befindet und somit Fehler haben darf.
Dennoch gibt es oft Mapbugs,das Spiel crashed durch Ladefehler,am Anfang einer Runde hängt sich der Server auf wodurch man warten oder das Spiel neu starten muss,manche Schiffe können mit anderen kaum bzw. garnicht mithalten usw.
Ich gehe aber davon aus,da ich oft mit entwicklern gesprochen habe,dass diese Kindheitsfehler noch behoben werden.)

-schlechte Performance/schlechte Server
(Auf meinem PC läuft dass Spiel am Anfang einer Runde sauber mit 70-80 fps allerdings verschlechtern sich diese drastisch auf bis zu 20-30 fps wenn es zu einem großen Kampf kommt.Mein PC setup steht in meiner Profilbeschreibung,ich selbst klassifiziere es als mid-high system.Wenn die Entwickler wirklich ein Free2Play Model wollen sollten sie an diesem Punkt ordentlich schrauben,sonst werden die meisten Spieler von diesem Spiel ablassen nur wegen der Performance.
Außerdem verursacht die hohe Latenz von durchschnittlich 100 eine ziehmlich bemerkbare verzögerung in der Steuerung.)


Ich persönlich vertraue auf die Entwickler da diese schon oft gezeigt haben dass sie können und wollen.
Die nahe Zusammenarbeit mit der Community und die Regelmäßigen Updates machen dieses Spiel immer besser und immer mehr Gamer tummeln sich auf den Servern.
Das größte Kontra ist die relativ schelchte Performance und der stetig hohe Ping,was das Gameplay teilweise komplett zerstört.Es wär schade wenn so ein Spiel gemieden wird,nur weil es schlechte Server und eine madige Perfomance besitzt.

Meinerseits eine Kaufempfehlung an Spieler die Sci-Fi mögen und an Competetive Moba Gamer.

Ps. über Feedback zum Review freue ich mich immer :)

 | Интересная неторопливая поначалу игра в космические кораблики плавно перетекла в активный тактический шутер с прокачкой корабля. Кораблей не очень много и на сегодня они напоминают TF2 персонажей: тяжелый и неторопливый танкующий крепыш, снайпер, шпион-подсиратель, середнячок для масс и т.д... Ну разве что для авианосца нет особого аналога. И шляп нет. Зато можно менять орудия, причем принцип действия каждого может отличаться кардинально (Например, ракеты или торпеды летят с разной скоростью и скорость наведения тоже разная, у каких-то торпед вообще наведение почти нулевое).
_
Для альфы очень неплохой задел, т.к. способности кораблей далеко не всегда помогают и решает правильное позиционирование себя на поле боя, и в соло бой вряд ли вытащишь, как бы хорошо ты не управлял кораблем, как бы не использовал астероиды для укрытия, как бы не уходил в инвиз или использовал преимущество в скорости. Игра нетороплива, но в итоге четкий просчет скоростей и состава кораблей противника позволяют творить невероятные гамбиты и вождения за нос. 
_
Для альфы стандартный набор минусов: на 28 января малый онлайн (в основном пользователи Нового Света), Ошибки матчмейкинга и частые зависания при входе в матч, в моем случае пришлось дополнительно настроить ярлык на запуск с дискретной видеокартой, как и со всеми альфами, бетами и иногда даже готовыми релизами.

П.С. Звуки и окружающий звук неплохо погружают в атмосферу. Пиу-пиу! Дакка-дакка! Ка-бууум! Пдыщь! Бам! | このゲームは、数千人が乗り込む巨大戦艦を操り5VS5で相手陣営の本拠点占領を目標に戦うものです。将来的にFreeToPlayになりますが、現時点で購入しておいて損にはなりません。何故ならば出資者ボーナスが付与されるだけでなく、宇宙が好き、SFが好きという方にとって満足いくものだからです。

　ゲーム内には様々な艦船がすでに実装されており、ステルス航行が可能なものや、そのステルス航行している艦船をブイを設置し探知するもの、短距離ワープを繰り返しながら戦うもの、高いHPをもった対空砲（範囲攻撃）を連射して戦うもの、長距離狙撃と味方の火力アップを担うもの、味方のHP回復や相手の武器やスキルを一時的に無効化するものなどがあります。

　それぞれの船ごとに得意な戦い方があり、苦手な相手がいます。従って○○を選べば最強というものではありません。しかしながら事前にチームを組んで戦うものではないため、その場で出会った人とチームを組んで戦う事が多く、結果的に誰もが対処できない艦船が相手に居るため負けることもあります。

　最後に。SF好きな人にとって、初期に乗れる艦船ですら、「あ、ここに飛行甲板がある！」「これは砲台だな？」と見ているだけでも結構うれしいのでは？

Fractured space is a 5 vs. 5 team battle on areas of space that has been divided in various sectors. All sectors have control points you need to capture in order to advance and eventually make your way to enemy base. During combat you can freely fly in the battlefield, warp into sectors where the combat is currently going on and warp back to base to regroup or to run away with your nearly destroyed ship for repairs. 

There's currently 15 different ship types in game, 3 of them unlocked right at the start. Ship types fit for many roles: long range, hard hitting sniper boat, heavily armored flagship for more close range combat, sneaky & stealthy assassin ship, fast moving frigate etc. As the game is currently in it's early stages, it understandably might have some balance issues between various ship designs - though I personally feel like every ship has their own use and an organized group will easily take down those solo snipers or assassins who think they can/should be able to kill everything themselves. 

PROs: 
Awesome ship design 
Well made level 
Graphics, sfx 

CONs 
1(one) level 
Very low playerbase (seen max of 54) 
Level Matching system(isn't one) 
No real training/tutorials 

For an EARLY ACCESS game, its good, Its not super great, but its really entertaining. Graphics are great, has a solid gameplay. People here are giving it negative reviews because they want a finished product but its no where near that stage yet. The game is great at its current stage and it can only get better from here. I'd definitely recommend this game for anyone who loves space sci-fi. | This game is a lot of fun.

All of the crew packs can be obtained through premium currency (Platinum) or standard currency that you earn in game (Credits). Other purchases are merely cosmetic, they are reskins of the ships. Different paint jobs and the like. Ships can be purchased with Platinum or Credits.

76561198041304371,456750,The Room Three,0.0,"Adventure, Indie",0,"Changing rooms is too slow, backtracking for endings is an absolute waste of time. Can't recommend. | It's bigger and slightly more complex than the previous titles. Has some very entertaining slightly ""spooky"" moments. 
Props for the solution for multiple endings: You don't have to restart the whole game, but you can continue from the latest checkpoint, just before you go to the final boss puzzle. | 한 거대한 상자의 비밀을 풀어내는 1편과 여러 방을 돌아다니면서 퍼즐을 수행하던 2편에 이어서 거대한 탑이 있는 섬을 탈출하기 위해 고군분투하는 포인트 & 클릭을 이용한 3D 퍼즐 게임 The Room 시리즈의 세번째 작품인 The Room 3이다.

The Room 3는 1편과 2편에 비해 더욱 발전된 그래픽을 통해 웅장하게 구현된 탑의 내부 전경으로 플레이어를 분위기적으로 압도한다. 또한 퍼즐을 풀때마다 여러 장치들이 얼개에 맞게 정교하게 작동하는 모습을 보여주어 이게 과연 현실에서 구현될 수 있을까? 라는 생각도 하게 한다. 퍼즐의 난이도는 엔딩 직전까지는 적절한 편인데, 퍼즐을 풀기 위한 힌트를 플레이어가 쉽게 알아볼 수 있게 배치해놨고, 힌트를 이용하여 퍼즐을 풀어나가는 재미도 잘 느끼도록 세심하게 설계해놓았다. ""장인""이라는 새로운 인물을 등장시키고 그의 편지를 통해 게임의 배경을 알려줄뿐 아니라 탑 안의 몇몇 퍼즐과 장치를 통해서도 게임의 상황을 알려주기도 하는 등 전작들과는 다르게 스토리를 풀어나가려는 노력이 엿보인다.

하지만 스토리를 진행하다보면 결국 여러개로 갈라진 엔딩을 맞이하게 되는데, 이 부분이 크게 잘못 설계되었다고 생각한다. 일단 엔딩이 여러개가 되었으니 각 엔딩을 보기 위한 숨겨진 단서들을 찾아야 할텐데, 이 부분에서 이전까지의 직관적이고 합리적이었던 퍼즐들과는 달리 플레이어의 눈썰미에 기대서만 찾을 수 있도록 설계되어 있어 너무나도 어렵고 불쾌하다. 이 단점이 앞서 말했던 웅장한 스케일과 맞물리면, 단서를 찾으려면 그 거대한 방들을 여러번 반복적으로 돌아다니도록 만드는데, 너무 시간을 많이 잡아먹게 된다. 또한 멀티 엔딩이라도 풀어야하는 퍼즐의 기본 틀은 유지되기 때문에 그 과정이 지루하다. 그리고 스토리를 풀어나가려고 노력은 했겠지만 게임 내적으로 무엇을 말하고자 싶은 거지 이해하기가 어려워, 이 부분이 장점이 아니라 오히려 단점에 가까워 보인다.

물론 장점이 좀 더 많다고는 생각은 하지만 굳이 사겠다면 세일 할때 사는 것을 추천한다. | ~геймдизайн. унылый симулятор открытия шкатулки с секретами. фанатам головоломок может и зайдет.
~сюжет. условный. продолжение.
~графон. ок. | My favourite of the three games so far. Great vibes, intuitive ""spatial puzzles"" and fetch quests. Definitely recommend!

The central hub world with its branching rooms works really well and never feels overwhelming. The use of the lens to go on short journeys is really nice, and you never have to worry that you've missed something there.

Building off of Room 2, the vibes and locations are excellent. In particular the use of [spoiler]the zoetrope[/spoiler] and [spoiler]mechanical Turk[/spoiler] were really nice.

I needed hints about once per room, and the hint system is pretty great. The first hint usually just tells you what area you should be in, without giving much away.

[h2]Two places that could be improved[/h2]

[h3] 1. It's hard to tell when you're missing an object vs just doing it wrong [/h3]

There are a bunch of puzzles that you can only interact with in a very specific way and it feels bad to get stuck, look up a hint, and then it sends you back to somewhere you've already looked and tried to interact with. For example, [spoiler]the telephone only rotates clockwise, so when I tried to moved it counterclockwise, it didn't move, so I figured I was missing some handle or something. Even adding a bit of ""wiggle"" if it's moved in the wrong direction would help. The gear puzzle in the courtyard is like this too. [/spoiler]

[h3]2. The [spoiler]ending(s)[/spoiler] need to be reworked[/h3]

* [spoiler]Solving the same ending puzzles over and over to get the additional endings is tedious, and not fun. Keep the projector up and just allow players to add the final artifacts. Or open multiple different doors lining up with the 4 tarot cards.[/spoiler]
* [spoiler]The post-game material is mostly frustrating because of the clock puzzle and the chandelier/safe puzzles gating the rest. These two puzzles are so unlike everything else in the game and require the player to interact with objects in counter-intuitive ways. The post-game puzzles could be more like ""expert"" versions of what we've done earlier in the game to make us feel smart and that we've grown.[/spoiler]
* The lack of (formal) hints for the post-game is fine, but I'd love to have more ""in game"" hints (e.g. blue lens ""paint"", or themes to the artifacts like ""sound"", or the craftsmen's key hums/glows when you get closer to the relevant puzzle). As it is I just had to look up guides on steam (which is not ideal)."

然后跟我一样陷入等待DLC的无尽深渊 | 一款将赛博朋克美学与高速战斗完美融合的像素风动作游戏。玩家扮演失忆武士“零号”，凭借预知未来的能力，在霓虹闪烁的暗黑都市中执行刺杀任务。游戏的核心体验在于“一击必杀”的硬核机制：敌我双方均脆弱如纸，玩家需通过精准的挥刀、翻滚、子弹弹反以及“时间减速”能力，在瞬息万变的战局中规划最优路径，稍有不慎便需回溯重试。这种设计既带来强烈紧张的压迫感，又因流畅的动作衔接与斩杀慢镜头特写，赋予战斗行云流水般的爽快节奏。
       游戏的叙事同样出彩。黑色电影风格的剧情碎片化展开，通过对话选项的即时打断或耐心倾听，玩家可解锁不同分支，甚至触发隐藏彩蛋（如用“Cosplay”借口蒙混警察）。“零号”与“心理医生”、疯癫反派“V”、“邻家女孩”的互动，逐步揭露药物“柯罗诺斯”背后的阴谋与角色挣扎于时间牢笼的宿命感。遗憾的是，故事在高潮前戛然而止，留下大量未解谜团，虽强化了悬疑氛围，却也令人意犹未尽。
       视听表现堪称像素艺术的典范：霓虹光影与电子合成乐交织出浓郁的80年代赛博朋克气息，血花飞溅的暴力美学与摩托车追逐战的纵深感设计更让人肾上腺素激增。尽管流程仅5小时左右，但紧凑的关卡（如矿车机关战、潜行剧场）与速通模式确保了重复可玩性。若你追求刀光剑影间的极致操作快感，并愿沉浸于一场晦暗而华丽的霓虹幻梦，这款独立佳作绝对不容错过!"

You build your base near good resources and then pray one of the bots won't claim those resources away from you.
Because when that happens you have no way of reclaiming them.
Add the fact that this game balances the difficulty by giving the bots higher stats (thus making the bot always pick resources to claim before you) and you get a game where you can loose within first 5 minutes of the game with no way of preventing it nor fighting back.
After you survive your first 5 minutes, next you have to sell resources, hoping that the RNG will decide that the resource that you are producing is going to be worth anything.

76561198041304371,475550,Beholder,4.0,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy",7,"Beholder is an absolute gem for anyone who enjoys thought-provoking games that challenge your ethics and decision-making skills. Set in a dystopian world where you play as a landlord tasked with spying on tenants for a totalitarian government, the game artfully combines strategy, storytelling, and morality in a way that few games manage to achieve.

From the moment you step into the grim, oppressive atmosphere of the apartment building, the game immerses you in its richly detailed world. The art style is stunningly minimalist, with a dark aesthetic that perfectly complements the oppressive tone of the story. The haunting music and sound design further pull you into the game's bleak reality.

Gameplay Highlights:

Engaging Decisions: Every choice you make matters. Do you report a tenant for illegal activity to protect your family, or do you turn a blind eye and risk your position? The moral dilemmas are intense and often heart-wrenching.
Strategic Gameplay: Managing resources, time, and relationships adds a layer of complexity that keeps you on your toes. Balancing the demands of the government, your tenants, and your own family is no small feat.
Dynamic Storytelling: The branching narrative and multiple endings provide excellent replay value. Each playthrough feels unique, encouraging you to explore different paths and outcomes.
Why It Stands Out: What sets Beholder apart is its ability to make you reflect on your own morality. It's not just about winning or completing tasks—it's about what kind of person you choose to be in an unforgiving world. Few games strike such a perfect balance between strategy and storytelling, making every moment impactful.

Verdict: Beholder is a must-play for fans of strategy, narrative-driven games, or dystopian settings. It’s a unique experience that lingers in your mind long after you’ve put down the controller. I can’t recommend it enough—if you’re ready for a game that challenges both your mind and your conscience, Beholder is the perfect choice.

Rating: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 (5/5)

 | It`s quite a shattering game, which emotional impact keeps player`s attention at high rate (and not only because it is about spying). Would definitely recommend to fans of ""simulators"" genre, the game often strikes with difficulties of maintaining a stable life and making moral choices.

Q;2208202441 | Human Fall Flat is a unique game that combines puzzle and comedy elements. The game offers players to control a clumsy character who must overcome various obstacles and puzzles in surreal levels.

One of the main advantages of the game is its humor. The control of the character is very awkward and naughty, which leads to a lot of funny situations and falls. This makes the game very fun and relaxing.

The puzzles in the game are also very well designed. They require the player's problem-solving skills and creative thinking to overcome the obstacles. However, they are not too difficult, which makes the game accessible to players of any level.

The graphics in the game are also noteworthy. The levels are very colorful and surreal, which creates a unique and memorable atmosphere.

Overall, Human Fall Flat is a great game for those looking for something new and fun. It offers the perfect balance between humor and puzzles, as well as unique graphics and atmosphere. I recommend it to anyone who wants to spend a few hours in a fun and exciting world. | Human: Fall Flat, where you get to control the most uncoordinated, clumsy character imaginable, because apparently, that's the fun part.

But don’t worry, you’ll eventually get it—after an hour of hilariously failed attempts and probably laughing at yourself more than the game itself.

- All of the classes feel different and every class functions with 2-3 different deck builds
- Almost every deck build can go infinite which is really fun
- You can name your companions anything ridiculous! 
- Items are varied and have a huge impact
- Gold is well balanced and your decisions on what to wear matters
- A lot of game for the money. It took me about 100 hours to beat every class on legendary mode.

cons:
- Some companions are massively better than others and it's almost worth restarting a run if you don't get the right companion at the start
- You occasionally have to wait on animations before being able to play the next card when going infinite
- After defeating the boss, if you go into survival mode, it does not play like the rest of the game. Not being able to uncover a map and decide on clutch healing detours sucks.
- Stops for infinites aren't guaranteed. If you see one and don't have it you HAVE to take it, even if there is a cooler option available
- Some alter choices are just never worth taking. 

If you like deck builders, this is definitely one of the most fun I've played. It's not as hard as slay the spire or some of the other deck builders out there, but it's definitely more fun in a casual sense. By the time you get to the harbinger, if you built your deck right, you'll feel god-like."

Unfortunately this game did not deliver for me.

I found the core gameplay to be quite limited and boring. Essentially all you do is one of two things in this game, either 1) retrieve an item or  2) beat someone up. There's other mechanisms to attempt to make things more challenging or interesting but they fall short, for example there's locked door or security defense systems, but you can just easily blow up walls and get to the objective quite easily with little resistance. Even with random level generation it doesn't add much lasting value, as you still do the same objectives but with a slightly different level layout but without much added challenge.

The gamepad setup and multiplayer support really sucks, it's very difficult to setup multiple game pads and steam deck support is non existent. Menus require the use of a mouse to navigate, so not ideal with just a controller. It takes me at least 10-15 minutes to get 3 game pads synced up right. And then on multiplayer you all share the same game camera so you all have to stay close to each other. The game appeal wears off after like 20-30 minutes. The UI is very busy with lots of wording.

The level art design feels like you're in an underground subway and not in an open outdoor city environment. The level sizes are pretty small and limited. Personally I would have found the game a lot more appealing if it was more like GTA 2 with a larger city map and vehicles to drive and wide roads and going inside multi level buildings to complete one more challenging objective. Perhaps the enemy could try to flee and you all have to work together to chase or trap them. I think that 1-4 larger static maps would beat random small map genration for this type of game.

I'm hopeful for Streets of Rogue 2, but if it's too much like this one I don't think I'd buy that one if it has this same setup and limitations. | I can't just pick this game up and stop going run after run. It's got so many ways to play it's just got so much replay ability honestly one of my favorite games.

(Vampires are my current favorite to play as) There as so many options I can't say enough how much fun I have even when I'm killed by random bs and have to start all over again I just keep coming back. | Замечательный рогалик, с действительно вариативными героями, которых, при этом, не сложно открыть. Прохождение игры может быть так же самым разным: от убийства всего населения до подкупа и тихой зачистки. А на выбор тут есть и вампиры, оборотни, инопланетяне (в длс), так и всякие ворюги, копы, рабовладельцы...

 | I am coming back to give this game a review after sinking thousands of hours over into both Civ 4 and Civ 5 and on the launch day of Civ 7. Having played Civ 7 for a few hours now, I can say that that those of us who truly loved and still love Civ 5 judged Civ 6 too harshly when it released. It changed some things that people liked, but I still found many of its new features truly enjoyable on launch. I had fun. I still preferred 5, but in 6 the art, the music, the innovations to unrest, espionage, religion, and--to a lesser extent--city development were all excellent. Heroes are cool. The roster is cool. Civ 7 has little that is as redeeming in it at launch and I wholeheartedly recommend 6 instead. | Нові стратегічні рішення та чудова графіка.
Але важко уявити, що в 2025 році ми все ще змушені бачити у світі ігор проросійські наративи. У новій версії гри розробники ""відзначилися"" черговим ігноруванням української локалізації та повного ігнорування української нації, яка переживає героїчну боротьбу за своє існування та незалежність.  

Анонс нового персонажа, цариці-душогубки, яка нав'язується як ""символ культури та просвітництва"", виглядає як зневага до мільйонів українців. Героізація імперіалістичної постаті — це не тільки обурливо, але й аморально в контексті війни та окупації, яку сьогодні переживає наша країна.  

Українці заслуговують на повагу в індустрії відеоігор, а не на спроби просувати імперський наратив під виглядом ""культурних цінностей"". Досить толерувати пропаганду! Вимагаємо повноцінної української локалізації, українських героїв і персонажів, які реально відображають нашу історію, культуру та боротьбу.

It's hard to believe that in 2025 we are still witnessing pro-Russian narratives in the gaming industry. In the latest version of the game, the developers once again ignored Ukrainian localization and completely erased the Ukrainian nation, which is heroically fighting for its survival and independence.  

The announcement of a new character, a tsarina-murderer being portrayed as a ""symbol of culture and enlightenment,"" is a slap in the face to millions of Ukrainians. Glorifying an imperialist figure is not only outrageous but also immoral in the context of the war and occupation Ukraine is enduring today.  

Ukrainians deserve respect in the gaming industry, not an attempt to promote imperial narratives disguised as ""cultural values."" Enough with the propaganda! We demand full Ukrainian localization, Ukrainian heroes, and characters that truly reflect our history, culture, and struggle. | 非常杀时间的游戏，经常一开始玩就忘记时间了，看着文明不停地发展，心里也会有种成就感，只是这个画风有点卡通了，要是能够写实点就好了😁😁😁"

 | A chill and long factory building game on a massive hand-crafted world, resource nodes are inifinite and only you can destroy/desconstruct your buildings; so you can take your time in building big and beautiful factories around them, as there are plenty of customization options to make some striking architechture.

Making sure you build with verticality in mind and also in spaces that are bigger than you expect to use is important.

There's a blueprinter building that allows you to create blueprints but only within the constraints of the building. Which can force you to think modularly and vertically which is nice, however i feel you get this tool later than you'd want to, and upgrades to it you also unlock later than what you'd want, and by that time it doesnt give you enough space to even create a neat modular blueprint with newer bigger buildings, and also by the time you unlock its final upgrade you might not even need it anymore | Satisfactory, как и многие игры-песочницы с элементами стратегии и управления ресурсами, развивает в мозгу несколько когнитивных функций:

Пространственное мышление:  Игроки должны планировать и оптимизировать расположение фабрик, транспортных линий и добывающих установок в трехмерном пространстве.  Это требует визуализации и планирования в нескольких измерениях.

Планирование и стратегическое мышление:  Успешное прохождение игры требует тщательного планирования.  Игроки должны прогнозировать потребности в ресурсах, разрабатывать эффективные производственные цепочки, и адаптироваться к изменяющимся условиям.

Решение проблем: Satisfactory постоянно бросает игрокам вызовы.  Нехватка ресурсов, сложности с транспортом, ошибки в дизайне фабрики – всё это требует креативного и логического подхода к решению проблем.

Управление ресурсами:  Игра учит эффективно управлять ограниченными ресурсами, оптимизировать производство и минимизировать потери.  Это полезный навык, который можно применять и в реальной жизни.

Многозадачность:  Игроки часто сталкиваются с необходимостью одновременно выполнять несколько задач: добывать ресурсы, строить, модернизировать фабрики, исследовать территорию.

Креативность и инновации: Satisfactory предоставляет игрокам значительную свободу в проектировании своих фабрик.  Игроки могут экспериментировать с различными подходами и находить креативные решения для оптимизации производства.

Навыки решения сложных задач:  Игра может потребовать много времени и усилий на поиск оптимальных решений для очень сложных логистических проблем, что развивает навыки поиска информации, экспериментального подхода и системного мышления.

Важно отметить, что развитие этих навыков зависит от индивидуального подхода к игре и уровня сложности, который игрок выбирает.  Игра не является заменой формального образования или профессиональной подготовки, но может служить эффективным дополнением к развитию когнитивных функций. | Oyundan keyif alıyor muyum? Hayır!

It’s essentially Factorio in 3D, with a first-person perspective that makes factory-building feel immersive and rewarding.

The game shines in its sense of scale, as your humble mining setup quickly transforms into a sprawling industrial empire of conveyor belts, automated production lines, and towering structures. The graphics and world design are stunning, making factory-building a visually enjoyable process.

That said, late-game logistics can become overwhelming, and some vehicles feel underwhelming compared to hyper tubes and trains. Also, while automation is satisfying, it lacks the depth of a true strategy game, focusing more on optimisation than city-management.

✔ Highly addictive factory-building
✔ Beautiful open world and exploration
✔ Deep automation and logistics mechanics

✖ Late-game complexity can feel like work
✖ Vehicles could be more useful

If you enjoy efficiency-based game play, Satisfactory is fantastic, but if you’re looking for diplomacy or deep strategy, this isn’t it."

76561198041304371,529110,Awkward Dimensions Redux,0.15,"Adventure, Indie, Free To Play",0,"This is NOT A HORROR GAME! I wanted to put that sentence at the very top, not as a criticism, but just for anyone who might have been scrolling past this after having seen the bizarre ""horror"" tag attached to this game. That tag nearly put me off from playing to begin with, because I'm just not a horror fan. But I'm glad I did play, because only the second level is even remotely horror-related, and the rest of it is much more my kind of thing. Anyway, on with the review:

So first thing's first, when playing this you will find yourself very tempted to compare it to Davey Wreden's The Beginner's Guide. The overall ""feel"" of the game, as well as several of the individual levels, are reminiscent of The Beginner's Guide, and the developer's commentary name-checks Wreden twice. The game even borrows one piece from The Beginner's Guide's beautiful OST (the housecleaning song from TBG can be heard during the ladder-climbing sequence in this game.) There's even a ""Beginner's Guide to..."" book that can be seen on a shelf in the game.

However, despite the fact that this game practically begs to be compared to TBG, I reccommend you restrain yourself from doing so. While there are certain similarities, the two games are fundamentally different in what they're trying to do. TBG is a heavily narrative-driven game with a relatively more limited degree of abstractness, whose clearly defined surface-level story conceals deep layers of hidden meaning and symbolism. This game is pretty much the exact opposite of everything in that sentence. Not because it's an attempt to replicate TBG that failed, but because it's trying to do something else entirely. So let's judge it on its own terms.  

If you fail to do so, you'll search for hidden meaning in every piece of abstract symbolism, and when you find none you'll be disappointed. You'll assume it's secretly trying to say much more than it's letting on, and you'll feel confused and underwhelmed when you can't find the deeper meaning. You'll expect it to build and crescendo into an emotionally devastating revalation at the end, and you'll be surprised when it actually ends in decidedly anti-climactic fashion. In other words, you'll judge this game far more harshly than you otherwise would if you simply accepted it for what it really is, and proceed from there.

Having played through the game twice and read the developer commentary, I am now reasonably confident that it actually is just a series of little mini-levels, strung together in no particular order, mostly inspired by dreams. The only thing that really consistently ties them together is the presence of a door in almost every level, and a more or less explicit autobiographical aspect to many of the levels.

However, this is essentially just a series of interesting little ideas, presented to you by a very young developer, and most of them are at least fairly enjoyable to look at or to think about. I particularly liked the fact that there was an unaknowledged hidden level, which (for me at least) could only be accessed by the level select screen, rather than being integrated into the flow of  the main experience. 

One legit weakness this game does have - aside from just ""Boo hoo, it's not as good as The Beginner's Guide!"" - is that the three levels which were, in my opinion at least, head and shoulders above the rest, and without which this review would probably be more of a ""meh"" than a ""recommended"" - namely the countdown/ladder level, the sabotage level, and the ""Time to get over her"" level - were also the three levels which seemed... err... ""most heavily dependent on external inspiration"" would be a kind way to say it. They're still great levels, with brilliant ambience and competent execution, but I was a little sad that the game's three peaks were also the three bits which most closely resembled ideas and symbols from Davey Wreden's games. However, perhaps that's just a comment on my own personal prefrences, and other people found the more original and inventive levels to be the highlights.

However, all in all I would recommend this game for an enjoyable, reasonably well made, fairly interesting, and somewhat emotionally impactful 1hr abstract walking simulator. It competently hits the target it's aiming at, and that makes it a good game, regardless of whether you think it's not the most interesting target it could have picked to begin with. I mainly enjoyed it because you can definitely see the seed of something interesting in there, and I can't wait to see how that seed grows and evolves in this developer's future works.

Also dank memes, so 13/10! | No deeper story, just a person's individuality recording and sharing his dreams to the world. Weird, yes like all dreams are. Not for everyone, but more than 50% of the levels are not too bad especially the ""self improvement"" i think is the name where you wakeup in the creator's bed room. just relatable. yet it cant be relatable for everyone. plus its freee. there are worse games charging money here. | Something about this game struck a chord with me. Perhaps it was the art style, music, sound, imagery, or perhaps just the overall feel. It made me familiar with the outright confusing.

I had originally thought this game would be just another ""Unity Game."" Slow paced, clunky, and poorly designed.
For the most part, I was very wrong.

Awkward Dimensions may not be for most, as it can be awkward and confusing at times. Perhaps even a bit too personal. But that's pretty much the point of the game, and it's executed quite well.

For me at least, everything fit together well. It was a refreshing break from the fast-paced, straightforward, tried and true methods of other genres. Awkward Dimensions comes off as a bit heavy handed, yet keeps a general rythm/atmosphere throughout.

Overall, an odd and wonderful mix of both sensation, and storytelling.
I'd highly recommend giving it a go. Take a break from your own head for a while, and enter the unfamiliar world of someone else's. | One of the most mesmerizing games out there. 

I found this game randomly in the Free to Play section. Once I loaded it up, I didn't think it would be that good (hence the Unity Personal Edition logo) but then, once I played it, I felt like I was in an entirely different world. The last level,  Find The Way Out, really spoke to me. When I was younger I was trying to find the way out. There was a time where I was basically trapped. 

It might eat up disk space, but it's amazing. | This was just... Wow. Really delves into the mind of someone with a dream thats kicked continuously. I can relate. This truly is a wonderful game and I am so happy it came up as a recommended game in my queue. Just fantastic. I just finished playing and it's something I'll probably never forget and play again later."

Ahora, Owlboy, como videojuego, es bueno, pero molesto
No es un juego particularmente dificil, pero es frustrante de jugar
Las mecanicas son particulares, haciendo que el combate te exija un poco de pensamiento, pero generalmente se siente como si estuvieras peleando contra los controles
Apuntar con el joystick es un calvario, y muchas veces hay ocasiones que, por diseño de nivel o de enemigos, se recibe daño injustamente (cruzando de un area a otra, o siendo golpeado por un enemigo que esta dentro de un muro)
Recibir daño es muy molesto, ya que deja a Otus en un estado paralizado que puede extenderse aun mas si llegas a estar cerca de una pared, lo cual pasa muy a menudo
Para ser un juego cuya principal mecanica es el vuelo, los diseños son extremadamente estrechos, siendo incomodo de maniobrar en la mayoria de ocasiones
El juego tambien adora meterte en zonas con poca vision, lo que hace que muchas veces tengas que perder progreso por estar buscando a ciegas el camino
Tampoco ayuda que Otus no sea muy agil, y que la movilidad del personaje no mejore casi nada

In addition, the boss battles all follow an EXTREMELY RIGID pattern which makes them very tedious and no fun at all to play through. In fact, they feel more like workㅡa chore that I have to endure before being able to press on with the rest of the game.

1讲的是三小只刚进学校到佐助离开并加入大蛇丸麾下的故事。
2是佐助加入大蛇丸3年后开始，到鸣人干掉晓组织首领的故事。

相较于前作，本作在游戏性上有了质的飞跃。战斗系统更加流畅，技能释放和连击组合更加多样，使得在战斗中能够享受到更多的乐趣和挑战。同时游戏的整体节奏也更为紧凑，减少了冗长的等待时间，能够更快地投入到紧张刺激的对战中。

前作中剧情主要通过PPT播片的形式展现，而在本作中剧情对话被巧妙地融入了游戏流程中，在体验剧情的同时也能更加自然地参与到游戏互动中。这种改进不仅提升了剧情的代入感，也可以对游戏世界的了解更加深入。在BOSS战中加入了QTE元素，这不仅增加了战斗的紧张感和刺激性，也让BOSS战的演出更加出彩，这种互动方式极大地提升了参与感和成就感。

本作新增了自动保存系统，这一设计可以人更加专注于游戏本身，享受游戏带来的乐趣，也让游戏更像是现代的游戏了。在剧情模式中不再局限于只能操作鸣人一人，而是可以根据剧情需要操作不同角色。这种设计不仅丰富了游戏内容，也能够从不同角色的视角去体验火影忍者的世界，提升了游戏的整体体验。

缺点在于地图视角限制，虽然本作在多个方面都实现了进步，但地图视角的设计却略显保守。游戏采用了类似老版生化危机的摄像头固定视角，这种设计在一定程度上限制了探索自由度和沉浸感。相较于现代游戏中流行的沙盒模式或自由视角，本作的地图视角设计显得有些过时。

虽然多人模式在格斗游戏中占据重要地位，但本作的多人模式已经处于鬼服状态，但是游戏却设置了3个与多人模式相关的成就，这无疑是全成就党的噩梦。

综上所述，究极风暴2以其显著的进步和独特的魅力吸引了众多火影忍者粉丝的关注。虽然游戏在某些方面仍存在不足，但整体而言，它仍然是一款值得一试的格斗游戏佳作。对于热爱火影忍者的玩家来说，本作无疑是一次不可错过的游戏体验。 | Segundo jogo da saga Storm. Surgindo para consolidar a temática de gameplay que a série seguiria.

Esse jogo consagra o estilo da série, com diversas melhorias e muitas batalhas boas de chefe, fazendo algumas lutas serem até melhores que a própria versão animada…

O enredo acompanha a era ""Shippuden"" do anime desde o começo, abordando a volta de Naruto para a Vila da Folha, após o treinamento com o Sábio Tarado, prosseguindo até o ápice da batalha contra o temível ""Pain"".

Uma grande mudança é o modo história que abandona o mundo aberto, e torna a Vila da Folha linear com lugares específicos, contudo, agora conta com viagens por vilas diferentes e outros locais conhecidos do anime.

As lutas contra chefes ainda usam ""Quick Time Events"", que são marcas na franquia, implementadas de maneiras mais coesas e sem excesso.

O jogo apresenta 42 personagens jogáveis, um aumento significativo na quantidade, e oferece um combate divertido com mudanças notáveis, já que agora não é possível lutar nas paredes, e fazer clash de Jutsus.

Mesmo aprimorando tudo que existia no “Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm”, o jogo pode parecer ""mais do mesmo"" se jogado logo após o primeiro. A caminhada entre os locais podem se tornar chatas, devido a “viagem rápida” ser liberada apenas próximo ao final do game.
Os modos onlines são vazios devido o baixo número de jogadores, tornando a platina difícil sem a ajuda de um amigo caso busque 100%.

No entanto, ainda é um jogo legal de jogar e se destaca como uma ótima escolha para quem busca ação e aventura no universo de Naruto! | com certeza é o melhor jogo da saga storm em questao de modo história, as cutscenes são impecaveis, os quick time events sao muito legais e o jogo nao tem como ficar entediante, a unica coisa ""ruim"" dele é que tem algumas partes que foram muito rushadas e outras que foram cortadas do mangá/anime | amei amo os jogos da saga storm e esse e um que nao tenho oq falar mal as substituiçoes sao meio bugada as vezes mais ainda continuo amando o jogo

Відмінність ігор VR від звичного ігрового досвіду перед монітором полягає в тому, що як би розробники не намагались візуально реалістично передати оточення, наповнити звуками і ефектами, кат-сценами з Motion Capture – ви все одно залишатиметесь [b]спостерігачем[/b], який через мишку і клаву взаємодіє з картинкою на екрані. У VR ви знаходитесь у самому серці гри, ви [b]і є головний герой[/b] у буквальному сенсі цього слова, і ви творите гру, та відчуваєте на собі її атмосферу.  

Спробувати пояснити, як відчуває себе гравець у Half-Life: Alyx, це як [i]описувати 3D світ якоїсь гри з PS2, людині, яка окрім тетріса в руках нічого не тримала.[/i] І мої глядачі, що дивились трансляцію не могли зрозуміти чому це Bender так ахкає і охкає, і інколи верещить!

Світ, що добре пам’ятаю з перших частин Half-Life, став значно ближче, його можна [b]торкнутись, штовхнути башку комбайна, ухилитись від хедкраба[/b], що стрибнув на тебе. Ти [b]в цьому світі![/b]. Моментами я зупинявся і ледь стримував емоції, щоб не розплакатись від того, наскільки воно крутезне і реальне!  

Я з задоволенням її пройшов, і з задоволенням пройду її ще раз, якщо знайду [b]пусте приміщення мінімум 10x10 метрів[/b], бо можливість вільно переміщуватись, а не телепортуватись, значно додає імерсивності.

Half-life ALYX - це не просто одна з найкращих ігор які я грав за останні десятиліття, це найраще в ігровому світі що я преживав! | I fear that the first VR game I played to completion is also the best VR currently accessible. I started this year off by finally working my way through the HL series which ended with what is likely the most immersive gaming experience I've had yet. HL Alyx is a masterclass in immersion, and within minutes of starting the scale of the world is expertly shown off as you overlook City 17 as humans and the Combine alike run through the streets, while striders scale buildings with easy. Truthfully, the gameplay consists of scavenging for supplies and gunfights (both more action oriented when fighting the Combine and more survival horror when dealing with headcrabs and zombies). However, the simple act of trashing some poor person's apartment building as you desperately hunt for just a few more shotgun shells or that last piece of resin is extremely satisfying. As per usual for HL games, the story and characters are a strong point as you work your way towards the final goal of Alyx's journey, and also as per usual, the game teases a future HL installment and only time will tell how well that ages.

Now off I go attempting to bring a garden gnome buddy with me on the journey of a lifetime | Definitiv ein Hammer VR-Spiel ! Wenn nicht sogar DAS VR-Spiel. Am Anfang beschäftigt man sich fast ausschließlich mit der Bedienung und Haptik der Controller und vor allem was alles Möglich ist. Das Spiel selber ist halt klassisches Half-Life.

The Driller can tunnel through walls, which is especially useful during evacuations. The Gunner has impressive firepower and can significantly support the team. The Engineer can deploy turrets that shoot at enemies and aid in navigation. The Scout is very fast and excels at scouting the terrain.

All in all, I believe Deep Rock Galactic is an outstanding game. I think it’s absolutely worth its price. | Хороший кооператив, интересные универсальные снаряжение каждого из дворфов, которых в игре 4, у каждого есть по 3 разного основного и дополнительного оружия, каждый из которых можно улучшать разными модификаторами из-за чего меняется механика самого оружия и билда соответственно, есть большой выбор костюмизации под каждого дворфа и на любой вкус, и этот выбор периодически пополняется, если играть в одиночку то может быстро наскучить, но в онлайне намного интереснее проходить уровни и лутать всё что откопаешь, ещё в игре есть ивенты с выходом боевого пропуска, благо после выхода другого пропуска ивенты не убирают и встречаются не на всех уровнях, поэтому они не надоедают, в общем и целом игру советую | 十分好玩的游戏，沙盒以及高自由度和丰富的配装思路使得这款游戏在游玩时间上能够到达几百小时不是问题。社区对新手玩家友好，上手难度适中的同时上限也高。虽然再多人联机中会存在一些不友好行为，但这部分玩家群体是深岩玩家中少数中的少数。

游戏也会存在我个人看来的一些缺陷

游戏中的语音交流缺失。大多数对局玩家间的交流偏少，语言交流甚至无交流是主流现象。对这部分有需求的玩家需要考虑一下。
游戏深度存在不足。目前深研银河的更新进展处于后期阶段。虽然游戏依然具有很大的更新潜力，但开发者目前更新的主要精力并不在深研银河上。游戏玩法多样，但实际游玩中你可以感受到还有更多的细节可以打磨完善，世界观可以拓展。

以满分10分的评判标准，我会为深研银河给出8.8分的成绩。

希望这个评论对你们有所帮助 :3 | I'll keep it short: Deep Rock Galactic is a really fantastic co-op, or solo, experience for anyone that enjoys taking on fun, dynamic missions while fighting off relentless waves of bugs. The gameplay is really quite fun, and there are lots of options to upgrade and change your loadout as you progress. Monetization is refreshing, with all in-game items earned through play rather than pay, and older cosmetic items still obtainable through luck and persistence. Although I haven’t played in a while and can’t speak to the latest seasonal updates, the developers have a solid track record of keeping things fresh.

I would reccomend to not do all of the sidequests in one playthrough because it will take ALOT of time to do them all so i would say to split them if youre planning on doing multiple playthroughs.

Also play the first game before this one, it will bring over some characters and decisions so the world feels more full. | Big improvement over the First game, combat feels great, you didn't get overwhelm with all sort of Lore at the beginning like the First, and pirates... bloody pirates! The story had comical pacing where you don't really know what you're doing and once you got that figured out you're about 2 quests from ending. It does have a thoughtful ending similar to the first, but if you didn't play the First then the Second won't have a similar punch, | Good CRPG. Alot of things done right. Recommend for any crpg enjoyer

The two things hurting it the most are 1. bonus solo xp and 2. salvation of time. The armor system isn't great either but its shortfalls are mitigated somewhat by the inversions in damage calculation. The categorical penetration could've easily been made more granular beyond under/over/penetrating, but it's not a big deal compared to the first two things. 

Those first two things break power progression and destroy tactics completely, i mean wtf you can reach max level 25% into the game and one priest spell is the cornerstone of an apex 'strategy' (if you can even it strategy) making you invincible. The upside is these two things aren't baked in. You can simply avoid using (abusing) them.

it's still definitely worth playing though, both deadfire and the first pillars game | Игра только для ценителей жанра. Обязательно играть во вторую только после прохождения первой иначе лор игры будет не понятен. Не много душнит в 3 акте но не значительно.  Так в целом игра очень интересная, красивая, с отлично проработанным миром. Советую с осторожностью.  Только для ценителей жанра. | Really good isometric cRPG. 80h in and probably halfway done with a playthrough (playing in turn-based combat). Plenty of content to be had. Everything voice acted, great morality and relationship system, great story and good combat (which could be better in terms of user interface and some balancing between skills, but otherwise it's great). Only cons like many others have pointed out is the ship to ship combat, which could've been so much more than a text based interaction that it is currently.

[h2] 简短的游戏评价[/h2]

游戏流程大概100h+，可玩性很高[spoiler] 费脑子 [/spoiler] ，游戏内有众多的武器以及装备（EGO）可以搭配，每天有不同的考验需要面对，看主管运气的同时也需要主管的优秀管理能力，非常适合喜欢管理类游戏的玩家入手！！（还好我是死鱼脑），游戏的难度适中，整体的游戏难度集中在后期收容异想体多了之后和每个部长的核心抑制以及46-49天。标签打着恐怖的但是游戏是没有任何恐怖内容的。[spoiler] 面壁女:? [/spoiler] 游戏的剧情世界观做的非常好，非常适合去体验游戏剧情，此外游戏剧情衔接到了月记的下一个游戏废墟图书馆(Library Of Ruina)和边狱巴(Limbus Company！！！)（小唐音），脑叶公司是月记三部曲的第一部曲！[spoiler] 恭喜你成功入坑月记 [/spoiler]在这里强烈推荐一下b站up主灰色渔歌的脑叶公司剧情大电影的视频（不是水军，单纯推荐），但是建议各位主管先通关了游戏再去观看，详细介绍了脑叶公司的剧情和大概的世界观.


[h2] 给新人主管 [/h2]

恭喜你成功来到世界之翼，在这里你将开启你辉煌的人生[spoiler] 无限重开的人生 [/spoiler]

[b] 下面是给新人主管一些小tips（没有剧透） [/b]
1.新入坑的主管一周目可以放心的选异想体喵~（千万不要选介绍是粉色字体的异想体啊kora！）
2.因为是第一周目，所以在第一周目打出游戏结局是很难的....新人主管如果实在管理不了了可以放心的选择回到第一天喵~（真的不推荐）
3.介绍一下游戏的存档机制，首先在游戏内研发出的ego是不会随着你回到第一天而消失的，所以不用担心！（需要注意的是员工死亡会丢失身上的ego）但是员工是会随着回到第一天就消失的。其次，记忆覆盖日（也就是游戏的第1,6,11,16,21,26,31,36,41,46天）,[u] 在这一天所选择的异想体是不能退货的！！！！！！[/u]（回到记忆覆盖日把异想体退货，算是游戏的一个小技巧）所以一定要在记忆覆盖日的前一天结束工作选择新的异想体的时候慎重选择！尽量不要选择一些非常难管的异想体喵~
4.在一周目可以选择玩到20-25天抑制了[u] 培训部部长Hod [/u]的核心再选择回到第一天然后打结局（如果你觉得你在一周目获取的ego够好而且员工等级够高的话可以选择玩到36-40天抑制了Geburah（惩戒部部长）的核心再回到第一天）
5.那什么是核心抑制呢？核心抑制可以算是一个游戏内存在的一个小挑战，在核心抑制中主管会正面与部长对抗,部长会给主管出五个任务，完成五个任务后会进行该部门的核心抑制，（小提示，在抑制该部长的核心时，该部门的异想体时不会融毁的,中央本部Tiphereth的核心抑制除外）此外，核心抑制给的奖励也非常的丰厚，特别是Hod,Geburah,Binah(研发部部长)的核心抑制奖励喵~
6.介绍一下什么叫异想体的融毁[strike] 我不知道有没有新人会不知道这是什么东西，反正我新手的时候一时半会没搞明白是什么 [/strike]，在每天工作时会有一个融毁等级（最高10级），每次工作到下一个融毁等级的时候会让全图内随机个数的异想体收容单元发生融毁，需要将员工指派到收容单元来解除融毁警报，简单来说就是，工作了这么久，有收容单元出问题了，需要派员工去看看怎么个事。[strike] 让我看看怎么个事.jpg[/strike]
7.关于我是否需要加班？总的来说，推荐多加班，我推荐是在10-25天内可以高强度加班，因为26天主管就要开始面对午夜考验了！（紫午夜警告.jpg）前期加班效率不高，10-25天刚刚好，后期加班需要看午夜考验给的什么了，只能说后期纯看运气。（我是后期轻微加班培养战神员工，一般来说每个部门只需要安排三名员工就够了，其中包含一名战神员工）
 

[h2] 异想体推荐 [/h2]

[i] 这里所推荐的异想体都是前期新手主管非常友好的异想体，包括管理，ego强度综合考虑 [/i]

1.Z级(ZAYIN级)推荐
[b] 【F-05-52 韦尔奇乐牌汽水】 [/b]本能洞察两个工作基本不会出差，洞察压迫基本上也不会出差，但是工作最好集中在本能和洞察，前期练级好帮手！
[b] 【T-09-85 我们可以改变一切】 [/b](工具类) 没错！虽然看起来很可怕，但是，他不会融毁，没错！它，不会融毁！！！！

2.T级(TETH级)推荐
 [b] 【T-06-27 1.76兆赫】 [/b]员工跑不快？攻击太慢了？正义等级低？那就去狠狠的压迫1.76兆赫吧！前期提升正义等级的好异想体，而且很难把计数器降到0，即使降到0了，压迫四次自动乖乖回到收容单元喵~
 [b] 【O-02-56 惩戒鸟】 [/b][spoiler] 这是什么？可爱的小鸟！摸一下 [/spoiler] 可以进行三个工作。本能洞察沟通都可以！练沟通很好用！出逃了千万不要镇压！！！鸟大爷日常遛弯不用管喵~
 [b] 【O-05-61 破碎盔甲】[/b]ego非常强力！T级拥有H级的武器！！！还是高贵的蓝伤！！！！！！一直本能工作就可以了，切莫沟通和压迫喵~
 [b] 【T-09-77 渴望之心】 [/b]（工具类异想体 携带型）没什么好说的，携带后增加员工的生命上限和攻击速度，让战神员工拿一天就可以了，不用还喵~

3.H级(HE级)推荐
 [b]  【F-01-37 冰雪女皇】 [/b] 婚姻介绍所（确信），可爱的冰雪女皇！可以练本能洞察沟通三个属性，而且没有计数器！！！完全不用担心融毁！！！！是非常适合练员工等级的异想体喵！ps：为什么叫婚姻介绍所呢？因为员工工作有概率被冻住（差为大概率）而这时候，只需要派出五级勇气的员工（五级勇气成功率为100%，四级为80%，以此类推）解救一下，然后两人永结良缘！（bushi）[解救后两个员工都获得非常强力的饰品]
[b] 【F-01-69 魔弹射手】[/b] H级有着W级的武器ego，在前期非常强力，武器可以攻击到一条线上的所有生物（包括自己人），可以进行本能洞察压迫三个工作，不容易掉计数器，不会出逃，即使计数器归零了也只是在公司随便开一枪，有概率生还。护甲ego非常强力，H级的甲拥有三抗0.7（红白黑0.7，蓝抗1.5）。是个前期适合练级而且ego强力的高产能异想体喵~（后期就不要带魔弹出门了，容易出事，别问我怎么知道的）
[b] 【O-01-67 蕾蒂西娅】[/b] 可爱！！！工作的时候只需要注意只派一名员工一直对蕾蒂西娅工作就好了，同样是一个适合练级的异想体,可以练本能洞察沟通三个属性，同时ego护甲和魔弹射手的ego护甲一样，H级三抗0.7,但是ego武器黑伤相较于魔弹射手dps略低（5.5）

4.W级（WAW级）推荐
[b] 【T-04-05 蜂后】[/b] （建议主管在拥有处决弹和有能力处理工蜂的情况下再收容）蜂后总体来说算是比较好管的W级异想体（我的看法），工作主洞察,一直将工作结果保持到优就可以了。如果管理的好可以获得两件三抗0.7的W级ego护甲（算是在W级内比较香的）和两件dps较高的（7.5）的红伤武器ego。但是缺点是如果主管没有能力处理工蜂和没有处决弹的话蜂后就会变得比较棘手。
[u] (((注：工蜂是在蜂后计数器归0后释放的黄色使职员死亡（包括文职和员工）后会将职员转换为工蜂，此外工蜂所击杀的职员也会在死亡后转变为工蜂)))[/u]
[b] 【O-02-62 审判鸟】[/b] 审判鸟的工作伤害为蓝伤，所以建议在主管拥有1.5的蓝抗甲和一名血量约100的员工后再对其进行工作，工作主沟通，或者主管可以考虑先收容着再去工作，不是文保协异想体可以放心收容，优点是如果成功摸出了审判鸟的ego你就可以获得一件全抗0.5的护甲ego和蓝伤的神奇武器了！算是中期较为强力的武器喵~
[b] 【O-01-73 绝望骑士】[/b] 非常乖的W级异想体，工作主沟通,我在游玩了这么久从来没让它出逃过，管理简单，只需要保证第一个对绝望骑士完成结果为优的工作（同时员工会有一个标记）不死就可以保证它不会出逃了，什么？你问我出逃了怎么办？esc重新开始这一天，（比a级更有威胁性）ego非常强力，白伤剑dps9.5，ego护甲全抗0.8（可以用来摸审判鸟了诶，好耶！）

5.A级(ALEPH级)推荐
[b] 【O-03-93 碧蓝新星】[/b] A级里面最好管的异想体，没有之一，正常工作非常难让他出逃，非常适合作为新手主管收容的第一个A级异想体，前提是员工的自律和谨慎等级必须为五级！！！！！（或EX）工作主洞察，工作白伤,ego武器dps12.55,算是很好的了，护甲为正常的a级水准，（三抗0.4,蓝抗1.0）什么？你问我出逃了怎么办？？？？文职酱sayonara~

前！期！千！万！不！要！收！容！的！异！想！体！！！！！
[b] 【O-01-45 疫医】[/b] 虽然属性上是Z级异想体，但是工作优12次后会永久变成【T-03-46 白夜】强烈建议主管不要在没有能力镇压白夜之前收容疫医，造成后期获取失乐园武器ego变得极为困难！！！！！！！！！由于疫医转变为白夜以及选择使徒有些复杂，此处不在赘述。

76561198041304371,489520,Minion Masters,14.75,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy, Free To Play",13,"I've played this game for years on and off and during that time I've gotten quite good at it - having even risen the ranks to the top 25 on the leader board with my brother in a couple seasons.

With the number of hours I'd played I even spent over 100$ supporting the game by buying skins and what not. I enjoyed the flow, the challenge, and the strategy. I know every card. How they're played. How they're countered. 

So why am I giving it a negative review now?  I recently came back to it to find out the game had completely changed. 

Why oh why have the devs decided to remove wild cards (doubles of the same card in the same deck) and duplicate cards (the same card in your teammates deck) in premade team battles?? Half the fun of this game was being able to strategize with a friend and come up with crazy combos, thematic decks, and sometimes just plain goofy ridiculous decks early in the league. I strongly believe the percent chance of drawing a deck defining card or executing your intended combo is a key element of dueling cards in general. Think Magic or Yu Gi Oh. Now a huge part of that fun and build design is just gone.

Effectively, they've changed the game that I originally fell in love with and after over 800 hours I don't think I want to play anymore. What a shame. | Rating: 7/10

Overview: Minion Masters is a fast-paced, free-to-play strategy game that blends elements of tower defense and collectible card games (CCG). Developed by BetaDwarf, the game pits players in 1v1 or 2v2 battles where they summon and control minions to battle against their opponent’s forces, all while managing a deck of cards. With its unique mix of gameplay styles, Minion Masters offers an accessible but strategic experience for fans of both strategy games and card battling.

Gameplay: In Minion Masters, players build and use decks of cards to summon minions, cast spells, and build structures on the battlefield. Each card corresponds to a different type of unit, spell, or structure that players can deploy in real-time. The key to success is not just about deploying powerful units but also about managing your resources (mana), timing your plays, and reacting to your opponent’s strategy.

The game offers several different modes, including standard 1v1 and 2v2, where players can compete against other players or AI. The matches are quick, lasting around 5-10 minutes, which makes it easy to jump into a game and not get bogged down by long sessions. The action is fast-paced, with constant back-and-forth gameplay, making it exciting for those who enjoy real-time strategy with a bit of card game strategy mixed in.

Deck Building and Strategy: The strategic depth of Minion Masters comes from deck building. Players can collect new cards and customize their deck to suit their playstyle, with different minions, spells, and special abilities available to choose from. The key to winning is finding the right balance between offense and defense, while also considering synergy between the cards in your deck. There are a variety of minion types, each with strengths and weaknesses, which adds an extra layer of tactical decision-making to each match.

Progression and Monetization: As with many free-to-play games, Minion Masters includes a progression system where players can unlock new cards and cosmetics by earning rewards from matches or purchasing card packs. While the game is generally balanced and not pay-to-win, there is an option for players to spend money on card packs and other cosmetic items. This could give some players a slight advantage early on, but most progress can still be made through regular gameplay.

Graphics and Performance: Minion Masters features bright, colorful visuals with a somewhat cartoonish art style that fits the fast-paced, playful nature of the game. The minions and spells are well-designed, with each card having its own unique look and animations that help bring the battlefield to life. The game runs smoothly on most systems, and the controls are intuitive, making it accessible for both new players and strategy veterans alike.

Audio Design: The sound design in Minion Masters is solid, with an upbeat soundtrack and engaging sound effects that add to the excitement of the battles. Each card and minion has its own set of sounds, from the footsteps of marching troops to the explosive effects of spells, helping to immerse players in the game’s action. The voice lines of the minions and the announcer are charming and add some personality to the game.

Challenges: While Minion Masters is accessible, there is a learning curve when it comes to building effective decks and mastering the timing and positioning of your units. As players unlock more cards, they can start building more diverse strategies, but the game’s fast pace means you need to react quickly, which can be challenging for newcomers. The game also features matchmaking, but occasionally, you may find yourself up against opponents who have stronger cards if you're not progressing quickly enough.

Final Thoughts: Minion Masters is a fun and fast-paced strategy game that offers a unique blend of collectible card gameplay with real-time strategy. Its quick matches, deck-building mechanics, and strategic depth make it an enjoyable experience for players who enjoy both card games and strategy games. While there’s a progression system that could feel grindy at times, the game remains accessible, and its focus on skill and strategy makes it rewarding for those who stick with it.

Pros:

Fast-paced and accessible gameplay
Strong strategic depth through deck-building and unit placement
Bright, colorful visuals with appealing animations
Free-to-play with fair monetization options
Multiple game modes including 1v1 and 2v2
Cons:

Progression can feel slow at times
Pay-to-progress elements, though not pay-to-win
Some balancing issues, especially at early levels
Can become repetitive if not switching up strategies
Minion Masters is an enjoyable strategy game for those who like quick battles, tactical decision-making, and card collection. While there are some minor progression hurdles, the game offers a solid and fun experience for fans of competitive, strategic gameplay. | This game was fun for a while. I found it late thinking it was a new game. After several months of loving it and playing it almost daily; the fun is now at its end. Nothing new is coming to it. | ""Если бы мне сказали, что я буду проводить ночи напролет, крича на экран из-за толпы миньонов, я бы не поверил. Но вот я здесь, с кругами под глазами и улыбкой до ушей. Minion Masters — это как смесь покера, шахмат и цирка, где все участники слегка не в себе.

Что мне нравится:

Миньоны-психопаты. Серьезно, кто еще будет бросать летающих свиней в драконов? Это гениально!

Стратегия? Шутка? И то, и другое! Ты думаешь, что всё продумал, но тут твой противник выкидывает карту, которая превращает твою армию в лягушек. Лягушек, Карл!

Быстрые матчи. Это как фастфуд, только без угрызений совести. 5 минут — и ты либо герой, либо лузер. Но в любом случае хочется еще.

Что не нравится:

Случайные карты. Иногда тебе выпадает такая рука, что хочется плакать. Но это часть веселья, правда?

Итог: Minion Masters — это идеальная игра для тех, кто хочет немного адреналина, много смеха и возможность почувствовать себя злым гением (или просто неудачником с хорошим чувством юмора). Если вы еще не играли, то что вы вообще делаете со своей жизнью?

Imagine reading a VERY interesting book, but every chapter or so you have to throw the book across the room and go pick it up to continue read it, and sometime you throw it too hard or too far so have to read the book from the start again. But if you can stick to it, the book is worth it.

If you like reading, game atmosphere and don't mind A LOT of fetch quests, you can enjoy this game. | If you don't like to read, skip this game. If you are interested play Sunless sea before this one, or get a bit into the fallen London setting with lore dumps on youtube, so you have a chance to understand whats going on. Then grab the monarch mod pack on nexus, which is just a really good vanilla-ish add on, includes a lot of extra gear and modules that make the gameplay better at the cost of very little polish. Then loose yourself and enjoy. | the core concept of the game, an RPG that spans 'generations' as your captains die, is kind of interesting. the application is endless fetch quests, pretentious writing, tedious combat, and difficult to track storylines as every character is 'named' with a descriptor + noun combination (""the incautious driver,"" for instance). getting the same RNG ""skill checks"" constantly because someone saw a spooky enemy that you've killed thirty times already just makes the entire experience more tiring. | Literally fantastic. Very long, but soooooooo good! I have even more hours put into the game than I have recorded on steam and I'd argue that I'm still barely scratching the surface! | It's a good book, but a terrible game. 

You can lose 8+ hours on a single coin flip (or worse odds) at which point you'll have to play those 8+ hours again to get to the same point and potentially lose again! You'll find yourself doing the same trade route for hours straight, just to get enough money to buy food and fuel to get to a new area. It really is a game of unrelenting patience for minimal payoff."

A great game with and interesting story and fun mechanics to start. But horribly grindy later on with the story falling over time and ending in... an interesting way. A game i have with a love-hate relationship with and likely will play again only to feel more disappointed. | This is a mixed review honestly, the game starts off great but really falls off near the end unfortunately. It has a great art style and a good soundtrack, the writing is above average, overall it's a chill and relaxing game. 

The shortcomings it has are small but numerous, such as tasks becoming a slow and painful chore, poor UI such as workbenches not being able to bulk craft some recipes for no real reason, not being able to cancel crafts, e.t.c. It's a lot less sandboxy that what I expected, which was a letdown, as the Church turned out to be a disappointment in the way you can build inside. 

Overall, decent game, not for everyone, but not bad... 6.5/10 | This game is hard to recommend so I won't.  TLDR;  Feels like a game that had a rushed and patchy finish with features being dropped or stripped.  Late game is a huge disappointment.   Zero replay-ability.

Late game brings what initially promises to be automation using zombies.  But apart from wood collection all other zombie jobs just make more work for you.  So the early game grind gets replaced with late game grind supporting the zombies.  The zombie farmers need to be restarted each time and the gold seeds they're using slowly diminish leaving you with the side job of hand growing more seeds.  The vineyard is up a cliff right next to your house but you have to run half across the map to get to it.  Gets very annoying and there is no late game staircase to get you up there quickly.

Corpse processing becomes a bore and almost pointless once the graveyard is full.  I would have expected ashes to be handled properly such as needing to put them in an urn right after you burn the body.  Instead you just collect your ash arbitrarily in stacks and craft the urns in your...kitchen?  In the end I found myself processing corpses only to collect blood to feed my speed potion habit because the game quickly becomes intolerable without it.  And with a maximum of one blood per day available you need to conserve those potions. 

The dungeon is a random collection of halls leading to pointless rooms with no rhyme or reason.  It feels like a complete afterthought.  Maybe just checking a box for the screenshot.  The lighting is bland and uniform throughout.  No mood lighting.  No ambient sound.  On the plus side combat is much better than most other games similar to this.  

The restrictions on placing workbenches etc seems like a half baked idea which just ends up being annoying.  You can't move things, only destroy them, losing most of the materials.  Since you have no idea what you're going to add later in the game you are forced to destroy and rebuild in order to fit new stuff in. Quality of life aspects like this seem to have been overlooked.

The church was the biggest let down for me.  I was so keen to get the final upgrade and bling out my cathedral to the nines.  But that never happened.  There are very few late game things that can be added.  You simply don't get extra bench rows.  There are no crucifixes, no fonts, no bells, no memorials.  The stain glass window was in my build menu for a long time and I was looking forward to the moment a glorious and massive, bright new stain glass window would twinkle in the central position at the head of the church.  It would be it's pride and joy!   Nope.  It's a tiny, dull turd of a sprite with no effects that you can only only place on the side.  The church is one of the central things in the game and a wonderful opportunity to let the player get creative.  It failed to provide that.

The alchemy felt like a lot of extra bloat was added by making it so each reagent has a powder, liquid and extract form and sometimes a goo form.  The trial and error style of finding new recipes is asking way too much of the player forcing wiki lookups in order to maintain sanity.

Quests were a mixed bag. Some were ok but many can be summarised as fetch quests involving many people and so many things to fetch or make or grow in a sequence.  Some of those characters only show up once a week leading to annoying delays in story progression.  Some quests will even have this delay with a single character who will say something to the effect ""Ah, great, you got that thing for me.  Come back next week and I'll give the thing I promised""  Ugh!

It's a no. | Complex yet simple to learn.
Its way easier to reach automation comparing to the similar games in the genre. and heck thats satisfying!!!

76561198041304371,601840,Griftlands,17.05,Indie,0,"This is better than Slay the Spire in my opinion, and I love Slay the Spire.  It's basically two card games plus a role-playing game in one game.  I put over 500 hours into this on PlayStation 5 and just got a PC and got it here too.  There are three characters/stories, and they just get better as you progress.  The world building is deep, and the stories are impressively well written.  There are a few scripted encounters in each story, but there are also random events so no two stories play out exactly the same.  After a battle or negotiation there is a draft where you get to pick one of three random cards for your deck, so there is deck-building too.  The characters you encounter are also not always the same, and so you can get different bonuses by making them love you (or different disadvantages from them hating you.)  This makes the game highly replayable.  Where the game failed was its marketing!  I'd actually never heard of it until I saw someone on Facebook ask:  What are your 10 favorite games of all time?  And someone had Griftlands in their answer, and I was like ""WTF is that?  Never heard of it.""  I'm glad I asked. | 进包了补一下我的评测好了，抬头一看我去，我竟然玩了40小时，huh？
将RPG与DBG玩法融合的剧情卡牌游戏，并且二者的占比几乎是64开的一款游戏。三位可选主角，有女主有人外，各自有不同的故事体验，丰富的选择取向和配音满足喜欢看剧情的玩家；两种卡牌对战机制，协商或战斗随机应变，用谈话的方式那就是话疗！（但是协商在最终boss战不起作用这点实在是，一周目疯狂话疗一点没升级战斗打我个措手不及）。
缺点是流程通关后，对比纯DBG来说欺诈之地的游戏过程，操作都显得繁琐，因此重玩性并不是很高。
考虑到游戏整体内容的丰富度，对于50块不到的定价来说确实性价比不错，比较适合轻度卡牌玩家游玩，对中毒卡牌玩家特别是杀戮尖塔佬来说可能会有点无聊了。[b]特别是不喜欢看字只喜欢打牌的，别买，买了又退款你也嫌麻烦，要么给差评游戏也冤枉啊。[/b] | 卡组的构建和两个战斗系统的搭配无疑是失败的，或者说，游戏的这两个核心之处带给我的体验是糟糕的。从世界观、人物塑造和美术等方面来说，这是个很好的胚子，可惜为了强行贴合制作组并不擅长卡组构建，这个胚子被糟蹋了，让人叹息。 | This is one of the highest-quality games I've ever played. 

The game is basically a deckbuilding, card battling roguelite. There are two types of card battles, each of which uses a different deck. The first type are combat-style battles that are almost exactly as in Slay the Spire (re-skinned, of course). The other kind of card battle is for negotiations, and it uses a different deck. Both types of battles are fun, are very well designed, and are compelling. But these make up only half the gameplay. 

Another quarter of gameplay is having conversations with NPCs as in an RPG. The player's choices in these dialogues result in different rewards or consequences that enrich the risk/reward mechanic and also make the game way more engaging and playful. 

The last (and smallest?) quarter of gameplay is deciding where to go when, buying/destroying cards or pets from merchants, and making allies or enemies. 

If you liked Slay the Spire, I challenge you to try this game.  Although I've only played a few hours of Slay the Spire so far, I think this is an improvement in just about every way. It's deeper, more interactive, has much better graphics and music, supports more play styles, has more types of ""battle"", and so on.

Moonlighter es un juego donde controlamos a un comerciante llamado Will el cual dirige una tienda llamada Moonlighter que vende toda clase de productos extraídos de unas extrañas mazmorras que se generan aleatoriamente cada vez que se entra en ellas.

No es el mejor rougelike de acción ni es el mejor juego de comercio, pero mezcla muy bien estos dos conceptos y lo vuelven un juego muy único y divertido.

Además, visualmente es hermoso y tiene muy buena banda sonora.



Más allá de esta premisa, no me gustaría contar mucho más acerca de la historia ya que es mejor descubrirlo por uno mismo.

Pese a que narrativamente suena bastante raro el concepto de que las mazmorras se generen aleatoriamente (osea a nivel jugable es entendible por el genero al que pertenece, pero a nivel de trama pues no tiene mucho sentido), poco a poco se va descubriendo el porque de este extraño suceso.

Es un juego que todo el mundo comienza a jugar por ver que ofrecen las mecánicas, pero todo el mundo lo termina por revelar el misterio de las extrañas mazmorras. Y merece la pena.


Pero lo importante: el juego.

La parte de rougelike de acción es bastante típica dentro de este genero: se generan los niveles de forma aleatoria pero manteniendo patrones que hacen que poco a poco los jugadores se adapten al entorno luchando contra varios tipos de enemigos y recoger las diferentes recompensas que otorgan.

Aquí lo importante será avanzar poco a poco y decidir cuando merece la pena continuar para seguir consiguiendo objetos y cuando es mejor volver a la tienda para asegurar todos los objetos conseguidos durante la run y no arriesgarse a morir y perder el progreso.

Piensa que este es un roguelike progresivo. 
Es decir, que lo importante es asegurar unos objetos para conseguir dinero con el que mejorar tu equipo y así poder derrotar a tus enemigos más fácilmente para llegar cada vez más lejos en la mazmorra hasta poder luchar y finalmente derrotar al jefe final.



¡Pero esto solo es la primera parte del juego! Ahora viene la segunda: el comercio.

Una vez vuelvas a la tienda tienes que vender los objetos para conseguir dinero con el que mejorar tu equipo (y también mejorar la tienda y el pueblo).

Lo que lo hace tan especial es lo siguiente: Tu no sabes el valor de los objetos que obtienes, lo tienes que descubrir mediante la reacción de los clientes:

¿Tu objeto es demasiado caro? El cliente reaccionará enfadado y no comprará el objeto.

¿Tu objeto es demasiado barato? El cliente reaccionará contento y comprará el objeto. De hecho, a veces la reacción será tan positiva que merecerá la pena subir el precio en la próxima venta.

Y en esto consiste el comercio: en buscar el equilibrio para que los clientes estén contentos y siempre quieran comprar, al mismo tiempo que tu siempre obtienes el máximo beneficio posible.



Si os fijáis, tanto el rougelike como el comercio tienen una cosa en común: Tomar decisiones.

No es un juego muy difícil, ni tampoco requiere mucha habilidad, pero si requiere pensar mucho en cada paso que vas a tomar para la siguiente vez que vayas a las mazmorras, puedas avanzar lo máximo posible hasta poder enfrentarte al jefe final de cada mazmorra y poder derrotarlo.









En resumen:

Un rougelike de acción y comercio que mezcla muy bien estos dos conceptos y lo vuelve una experiencia única y muy entretenida.


Moonlighter es uno de estos juegos que no hace nada revolucionario que destaca por encima de otros videojuegos del mismo genero, pero todo lo hace bien y de forma justa y balanceada. Tanto el combate, exploración, gestión comercial y progresión es excelente y dura lo justo para que nunca se sienta aburrido ni repetitivo en ningún momento.

Además, entra muy bien por los ojos por esos hermosos gráficos pixel art, tanto en sus escenarios, como sus animaciones llenas de detalle en el protagonista y los diferentes NPC de la aldea.

¿Y que decir de la banda sonora? Delicia para mis oídos. Además me encanta la música dinámica cuando hablas con los diferentes comerciantes del pueblo y estos tienen su propio tema adaptado a su temática.


Nada más que decir señoría: Juego totalmente recomendado. Imprescindible si te gustan los rougelike y los juegos de comercio.

You will hate this game, and then come to love it, and then hate it again, and then go back to loving it. You will go through every single emotion, every stage of grief, the highest of highs and lowest of lows playing this game, struggling at this game, and trying to improve at this game until it etches itself into you like the microplastics in your blood stream. And once it gets it grip on you, it won't let go. You're gonna keep coming back to this game. It won't matter why. Maybe you meshed well with similar games that allow for different play styles. Maybe you're too stubborn to let the game knock you down after losing, maybe it's because games have gotten too stale and that this is your last reliable source of pure, no nonsense gameplay. Even when you think you're done, you're not. Maybe there's a new update and you wanna take a gamble at how broken it is. Maybe one of your friends suggest you two play a run together like two crabs in a giant bucket. Maybe a mod releases that just let's you PLAY AS A TANK. 

I keep coming back to this game, more so than any other game I've played in my entire existence. Very rarely can a game like this feel as fresh on run 1 as it would on run 1000. I'm writing this after completing a monsoon Artificer run when most of my runs have been on rainstorm. That run in particular felt like one of the hardest challenges I've ever had to do, and vastly different from any of my autopilot huntress runs. 

I hate this game, and I love this game. I hate how this game has consumed me since I first game it an honest attempt at 4 years ago, yet I love how games like this can just exist. It's a game that will ruin slower paced games for you. It's a game with the potential of forming the strongest of bonds with other people. It's a game that will teach you how to get good at games. It's a game with a soundtrack made by someone who thinks he's the shit and has the evidence to back that up. It's a game that goes on sale for $8 that I put 800 hours in without even touching eclipse and having barely dipped my toes into modding.

It's a game.
Not a sad imitation of a movie
Not a glorified storefront or slot machine (although gambling is still present)

Desbloqueos constantes, desafíos estimulantes, clases MUY divertidas, objetos icónicos y una jugabilidad simple pero efectivísima.

Mi Rogue-Like favorito, simplemente peak.

10 Ukeleles/10 | OK, this is on my top 5 list of games. It’s fun, has a level of difficulty that seems impossible at the beginning, but after playing for a few hours, it gets easier. The game has close to no meta-progression, making it very skill-based. Even the first survivor you unlock can easily beat Eclipse 8 after you get used to the game. All the survivors are equal in ability (except the Seekers of the Storm ones), and each survivor offers a nice new playstyle, so there is something for everyone.

The item system is awesome. At the beginning of a run, you start with nothing and can die easily, but after getting items, you can feel much stronger. With the ability to scrap your items to print out different ones, the build combinations are endless. You can become a tank that can out-heal almost any enemy in the game, or you could become a glass cannon, dealing insane damage but dying in a single hit. The pacing of the game is near perfect, with the difficulty ramping up the longer you play in a single run. This forces you to make strategic decisions, like whether to go for more items and face stronger enemies or proceed to the next stage with fewer items to keep the enemies weaker.

The fact that this game has multiplayer makes it even better. While playing alone can be fun, playing with a friend is always better. The ability to coordinate with friends to synergize is amazing. One of my favorite combinations is an Engineer using Bustling Fungus (a healing item that can heal tons when you stand still) and a glass cannon of any survivor type (my favorite being Railgunner, a DLC character). The Engineer allows the Railgunner to regenerate all damage instantly, while the Railgunner one-hits everything. While this might make it seem easier, the difficulty in multiplayer increases much faster, balancing things out.

The game has a charming, low-poly art style that works perfectly with the fast-paced gameplay. The stages are beautifully designed, ranging from an arctic military base to floating islands, making the game diverse in its environments. After many hours in the game, they can get slightly repetitive, but overall, they are beautiful and built perfectly, neither too big nor too small, except for one random Stage 1 that is just way too big.

Even though it is a near-perfect game, it is not without flaws. While the lack of meta-progression can feel rewarding and nice for people who enjoy skill-based gameplay, those who prefer persistent upgrades might find the lack of post-run rewards unsatisfying. After 40-50 minutes of gameplay, having to restart can feel frustrating, but that’s kind of what you sign up for when you buy a game in the roguelike genre. For those who are willing to put in the work and learn the mechanics of the game, it can be one of the most fun experiences out there.

The amount of dopamine you get from looping (restarting back at Stage 1 with all your items and difficulty at the same level) and becoming so overpowered that you destroy everything in your path is amazing. And when you finally get so far in the game that you crash it (the true ending), it’s an incredible feeling. That moment is indescribable. It feels amazing.

Overall, amazing, 10/10, please buy it. Don’t bother reading more reviews or questioning whether it’s worth it or not. This is one of the only games I would truly suggest buying, even if it’s not on sale. What are you reading this for?

Ah yes, [b]Goat Simulator[/b], the game that boldly asks, ""[i]What if a goat could headbutt reality itself?[/i]"" If you've ever woken up and thought, ""[i]I want to wreak havoc as a physics-defying goat,[/i]"" then congratulations – your oddly specific dream is now a reality.  

This is not just a game; it's a [b]life experience[/b]. Forget saving kingdoms, fighting dragons, or becoming a space marine – you're a goat, and your only mission is to turn everything into absolute chaos. Climb ladders with your nonexistent hands, lick random objects (because goats apparently have magnetic tongues), and launch yourself into orbit because physics in this universe took a permanent vacation.  

[hr]  
[b]Highlights:[/b]  

[b]Story:[/b] There isn’t one. You’re a goat. Make your own story. Maybe you’re a disgruntled farm animal on a quest for revenge. Or maybe you’re just vibing in a world where everything explodes when you touch it.  

[b]Graphics:[/b] Stunningly realistic… if the world was designed by someone who just discovered ragdoll physics and said, ""[i]More. MORE![/i]""  

[b]Gameplay:[/b] Imagine playing Skyrim but with no quests, no objectives, and way more headbutting. It’s perfect for people who enjoy the feeling of total anarchy without consequences.  

[b]Soundtrack:[/b] Mostly goat bleats, explosions, and the sweet sound of destruction. It’s beautiful.  

[b]Replayability:[/b] Endless. Every time you boot it up, you’ll find a new, equally absurd way to destroy everything around you.  

[hr]  
[b]Pros:[/b]  
- You can become a demon goat, a robot goat, or even a goat that’s somehow a giraffe. Truly revolutionary character customization.  
- Break the laws of physics with zero remorse.  
- There’s a multiplayer mode, because why wreak havoc alone when you can bring friends?  

[b]Cons:[/b]  
- None. It’s a flawless work of art. (Okay, maybe it crashes sometimes, but let’s call that a feature.)  

[hr]  
[b]Final Thoughts:[/b]  

[b]Goat Simulator[/b] is not the game we deserve, but it’s the game we needed. It’s a love letter to chaos, and it reminds us all that sometimes, you just need to let loose and headbutt a car for no reason.

Це як той момент, коли ви відкрили для себе, що Козли можуть бути абсолютними королями хаосу, якщо їм дати владу над симулятором їх життя. Так що, якщо вам колись здавалося, що життя занадто серйозне, ""Goat Simulator"" тут, щоб показати, що все може бути набагато абсурднішим... і веселішим. А ще є моменти про які мріє Майкл Бей, (вибух, вибух, вибух). [/b]

У біблійній традиції, зокрема у Книзі розробників, описується створення світу Coffee Stain Studios протягом шести днів, кожен з яких має свої специфічні події. Ось короткий огляд того, що сталося кожного з цих тижнів: [/b]
[hr][/hr]

[i] [h1] Тиждень 1: [/h1]
    • Coffee Stain Studios придумав Козла, відділив його від темряви персонажів, створивши концепцію безумства та гри
      [hr][/hr]
[h1] Тиждень 2: [/h1]
    • Coffee Stain Studios створив ігрову твердь та небо, поділивши води над твердю від вод під твердю так і створили біом.
      [hr][/hr]
[h1] Тиждень 3: [/h1]
    • Coffee Stain Studios зібрав всі ідеї скинув в одне місце і перемішав, відкривши безумство як рушійну силу, яку назвав ""Goat Simulator"", а зібрані напрацювання — «Хороший документ з дизайну». Він також створив рослинність: трави, рослини, що приносять віртуальні плоди та дерева, що несуть графічне насіння.
      [hr][/hr]
[h1] Тиждень 4: [/h1]
    • Coffee Stain Studios виставив світло, написали кодом, місця переміщення між локаціями та фізику предметів.
      [hr][/hr]
[h1] Тиждень 5: [/h1]
    • Coffee Stain Studios населив землю не розумними людино — істотами та створив птахів, що літають над землею. Він благословив цих створінь, щоб бігали та удавали, що наче живі.
      [hr][/hr]
[h1] Тиждень 6: [/h1]
    • Coffee Stain Studios створив наземних тварин, скрипти поведінки, плагіни та, нарешті, Козла за Своїм образом(бо головний гейм дизайнер у Компанії дійсно козел, іншого я не придумав пояснення). Він дав Козлу владу над усіма функціями по ігровому світу та у небі. [/i]
      [hr][/hr]
[h1] Після цих шести тижнів творення, Coffee Stain Studios зібрали вечірку на сьомий тиждень, після того, як портували гру на всі можливі платформи. І стали збирати хайп, хейт та зелених президентів. [/h1]

[b] ""Goat Simulator"" від студії Coffee Stain Studios — це відеогра, що вийшла у 2014 році, яка відразу ж стала культовим явищем завдяки своїй абсурдності та нестандартному підходу до геймплею.
[hr][/hr]

Графіка в ""Goat Simulator"" навмисно недосконала, що є частиною її чарівності (бо гра надихає на створення ігор з необмеженим потенціалом, використовуючи конструктор Unreal Engine чи Unity). Це не зусилля на висококласну візуалізацію, а скоріше нагадування про старі, менш потужні ігри(що є актуальними та хорошими іграми крізь роки: [url=store.steampowered.com/app/40800/Super_Meat_Boy/] Super Mario Bros, The Legend of Zelda, Minecraft, [/url]  [url=store.steampowered.com/app/24780/SimCity_4_Deluxe_Edition/] SimCity [/url] , [url=store.steampowered.com/developer/civilization]  Civilization [/url] , [url=store.steampowered.com/app/455400/PACMAN_256/]  Pac-Man [/url] , Street Fighter, [url=store.steampowered.com/curator/34459938]  Final Fantasy [/url] , [url=store.steampowered.com/curator/35501448]  Doom [/url] , [url=store.steampowered.com/app/2114810/Tetris_Girls/]  Tetris [/url] ).Моделі персонажів, особливо кози, виконані з гумором, і всілякі недоліки в анімації додають грі комічного ефекту. Ігровий світ виглядає як мініатюра справжнього світу, з його фізикою, що часто призводить до кумедних ситуацій.(не баг, а фіча).
[hr][/hr]
Суть гри полягає в тому, щоб бути Козлом, у всіх сенсах, можна робити майже все, що завгодно, без жодної мети або сюжету. Ви можете стрибати, літати, руйнувати об'єкти, вчиняти хаос. Фізика в грі часто поводиться непередбачувано(чого варті тільки стрибки та використання язика), що робить кожну сесію гри унікальною. Є різні режими гри, які додають різноманітності, але суть залишається тією ж — творити безлад.

But seriously, this game made me feel dizzy and nauseated. I mean, it's a funny game, but damn, it made me feel bad. | Absolutely the best simulation game yet. Not only do you get 127 achievements to look out for, but the sheer amount of chaos you can create is more than enough to waste an hour laughing to.

This game is unapproachable for new and returning players, as the bots do not offer a significant challenge and matchmaking lobbies are filled with players who have simply been playing the game longer than you. There is no skilled matchmaking, so picking up and learning this game is just not worth the mental effort.

Sadly, Atari won't be able to revive a game reliant on its online, when new player hostility is this bad.

Great game. Terrible playerbase. | Game was really fun about 10 years ago, and I'm glad it's back to being playable, but there are only about 100 people who play this now and they're all really good and will mock you for being worse than them. | I'm so happy they brought this game back. I know it says I have 1700 hours in this game, but that's not actually true--I played hundreds of hours on PS3 before this game even launched on PC. I've also played Lol, DotA, Smite, HotS... if you can think of a MOBA, I probably at least tried it, and a few of those a sank hundreds of hours into. 

Awesomenauts tops all of them. It's just better. 

If you want to be able to compete against another team using complex mechanics and teamwork to conquer your enemies in a 1980's Saturday-morning cartoon-inspired universe, this right here is your jam. 

If you don't want that, then we can't be friends. Maybe you'd rather have some oat bran to watch or a hoop and stick you could play with. You might prefer watching paint dry. 

If you want to play a game that is super duper fun and occasionally also super frustrating, look no further. | I played the version on the ps3 first and even with the current reversion its still a killer game. You will not be able to play every character due to some being behind old dlc that isn't available but the selection is still better than the ps3 version. I wouldn't recommend looking for keys for those old dlc characters because it will be a crap-shoot whether or not the key will even work. Since it is a free game it is absolutely worth playing especially if you have friends. | It's quick to learn and lots of fun and unique characters and maps.

我的力量有人能及啊…


---致我人生第一次玩的卡牌肉鸽神作《杀戮尖塔》
前几日冬促，购买了《杀戮尖塔》这款游戏，在玩之前心里曾想：我玩过那么多个3A大作，怎能会被一个小小的卡牌游戏震撼呢？看着steam好评如潮的评价，心里抱着不理解和尝试的态度，还是打开了游戏。

没错，我摊牌了，我彻底被这个游戏折服，从买完游戏到现在我无时不刻都在玩，目前也差不多一百小时了，如此优秀的游戏玩法和质量已经能超越很多3A大作。

再玩之前，我也确实久仰杀戮尖塔在卡牌肉鸽当中的地位，但是我也确实从来没玩过卡牌肉鸽，《杀戮尖塔》也属于我在肉鸽类游戏中的白月光了吧。确实只有在实际上手之后才能感受到其中的魅力。从最开始的重开在商店里找好遗物，到现在稍微有些对删牌过卡的理解，这种不完全依赖随机而是能够在游戏局内运营、构筑卡牌的机制正是它的魅力所在。同时四个角色特色迥异，相同角色又因为不同的牌组构筑有着不同的打法，再加上几乎毫无门槛的操作，在roguelike游戏的重开-学习的过程中，低挫败感、高成就感、对卡牌的熟悉以及逐渐对角色的理解使得游戏过程不像通常的卡牌roguelike，而更加有趣，能取舍是否该拿牌、是否该移除卡牌、接下来又该怎么构筑，这使该游戏的可重复游玩性大大增加。


前些天终于用战士，猎人和鸡煲把心脏打通关了，也算是对这游戏有些浅薄的理解了

开始玩这游戏的时候，好哥们建议我先玩鸡煲，说是鸡煲转起来特别强，而我也感受到了。

后来哥们和我说，玩战士得学会烧牌，我很诧异，明明每张牌都是我精挑细选的，为什么要把他们烧掉呢？后面理解了，把效率低的卡烧掉后，留下单卡效率最高的卡，打怪效率更高。之后喜欢上了烧牌的感觉，尤其很喜欢腐化，当把其他牌烧干净后，只剩下那几张攻击牌，颇有种破釜沉舟的感觉，就算打不过再sl嘛，把不该烧的牌留下来。

当我研究战士烧牌的时候，我认为战士是一个最需要想象力的职业，玩的时候得靠想象力。

关于杀戮尖塔的赞美太多太多了，我不想去赞美游戏的本身。我印象最深刻的一局是战士第一次打败心脏，因为卡组不太好，强度不高。我腐化黑拥SL一个小时二十次，结局依旧是输。我相信我能赢，我把29张牌牌序列出来，腐化黑拥烧完不同的牌牌序列出来，一个小时后我终于找到了那个解，最后我赢了之后长舒一口气。在那一刻我赢了游戏，在那一刻也赢了时间。或许一个小时我重开一局选牌好早赢了，可是能赢的局我不愿认输。


即使最后我们都会输给时间，这没关系，那也要谱写出每个人自己生命的赞歌。什么是生命的赞歌？或许是藏在人们骨子里的永不屈服、永不妥协、永不认输。

我的人生没办法sl，为了战胜这一路上的小怪，烧过那么多休息牌，娱乐牌，还换了那么多血，这是否真的值得？可惜这个问题的答案没法通过sl去知道了。
现在的我，就想赶快走到下一个篝火休息。人生啊，总是奔向下一个篝火，区别是以前的我会在篝火敲牌，以后我只会休息了。

最后感谢《杀戮尖塔》给我带来一百小时的快乐时光，我现在唯一后悔的就是在大学期末考试期间购买了这款游戏，这游戏真的有瘾啊！😭 | My first 500 hours in Slay the Spire were hours I didn't pay for. 

I was a kid in highschool, broke, there was only 3 characters in the game, Vine was alive and Tiktok had yet to really get a foothold in the world. It was a better time.

And I... sailed the seas. Its not something I'm ashamed of, and if you are down on your luck, still a kid, or just don't feel like jockeying the Steam refund policy to see if you like a game, most game devs would prefer thats how you play their game over buying a copy of dubious origin from a reseller. 

Why even bring this up, you might ask? Well, it was only last year that I realized how much had gone into the game, and that there was a 4th character that I had no clue even existed. And, against my better judgement with regards to my ever disappearing free time, I picked up STS again to try that 4th character. And then I started playing the other characters too. And then I started ascension runs. 

Never in all my days have I encountered such a well crafted deckbuilder. Being singleplayer, STS doesn't care if you find a combo that breaks the game and makes the enemy unable to interact with you. Slay the Spire doesn't try and limit your ceiling, it dares you to go infinite, it [i] wants [/i] you to go infinite. My favorite part of the game is how it encourages offense while putting more than enough wrinkles in your path that you can't just go full zerg rush. Fully indexing into any one thing without accounting for the counters puts you on the path to losing. 

Learning the Watcher, the illusive 4th character I didn't know existed as it got added after I put my 500 [strike] pirated [/strike] pre-purchase hours in has been one of the most enjoyable deckbuilding experiences I've had since... well since I played STS the first time. 

The main thing I was trying to do on the Watcher that was so fun was going infinite. There was a really interesting play pattern you can take where you reset a lot and chop your deck down to like 3 powers and then your 2 card combo that goes until you win. The fun part is that by taking your deck down to so few cards, any enemy that adds cards to your deck in any way is immediately the most threatening thing you could encounter. You also have to make illogical decisions in order to get to infinite. You skip like 90% of cards you are offered, you make sacrifices for some things that would never make sense in a normal run. And that is just ONE way to play the game on one character, completely ignoring everything that comes with ascension runs. 

And all of that is also completely ignoring everything that isn't purely gameplay. The art is amazing, the soundtrack is amazing, the sound DESIGN is amazing, and there has never been a better time to get into Slay the Spire because there is a sequel that looks like its amping up everything about the first game and giving more of what is undeniably one of the grandpappys of indie roguelikes. That would've been a silly statement 10 years ago, but there are so many indie roguelikes now that it can be hard to stand out among them. 

Slay the Spire has stood the test of time and remains at the top of the tower. Play this game, and if you can, uh, pay for it while you're at it... I did. Eventually.

[code] https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42143664/ [/code] | 又开始带鸡煲节奏了我真是服了😅鸡煲是这个游戏唯一的完美职业，已经和尖塔融为一体，成了尖塔的底层逻辑，成名绝技偏差认知给尖塔带来了这个贴吧最经典的话题，创造了尖塔的黄金时代，诋毁鸡煲，你想毁了杀戮尖塔吗？
 | Dangerous dangerous game, whether you are playing it on the go via tablet or have it on steam maybe with mods as well, if this is the right game for you your free time will evaporate. If you like deckbuilding, pve strategy and the like, this is just perfect. If you've got a background in competitive/multiplayer collectable card games, the pve nature of slay the spire enabling you to do some truly unbalanced things will make you ecstatic

If you're thinking of ""why bother getting this game when Slay the Spire 2 is going to come out soon?"", well this is already one of the best games of all time, don't be silly. | Strong game play loop with an limitless skill gap which relies on knowledge of the game.

Never is there a time where I play this game and don't feel like I'm getting better at it.

Base game alone offers hundreds of hours of playtime; in addition steam workshop supports modded content for this game.

If you don't already own this game, what are you waiting for?"

If played solo, this game quickly becomes boring, in my opinion. However, when played with friends, the experience changes completely and becomes much more fun.

Unfortunately, during my multiplayer experience with friends, I encountered several bugs that made the gameplay frustrating at times. As I usually try to platinum my games, obtaining all achievements is essential for me. However, with Raft, the multiplayer experience was far from satisfactory. While two of my friends were able to unlock achievements without any issues, I, on the other hand, could barely unlock any, even though I was always with them. This forced me to create a single-player world and replay a large portion of the story, including defeating some bosses alone again...

This was the issue that bothered me the most, but it wasn’t the only one. Many times, when trying to collect loot, I simply couldn’t. Sometimes, the interaction option didn’t appear; other times, even when the option was available, clicking on it didn’t do anything.

[b]Although I recommend playing the game with friends, I must warn that the experience can be negatively impacted by various bugs that affect gameplay...[/b] | Игра хорошая, на часов 40-50 вообще контента много. Сюжет средний, но игра не про сюжет. Множество возможностей для строительства (почти маинкруфт), много крафтв, готовка еды тоже порадовала разнообразием. Добротный выживач | Данную игру я полностью прошёл в компании 2 друзей и это было просто незабываемо. Мы вместе радовались, плакали, ухаживали за ламой Манькой и тд. Короче если у вас есть компания друзей и вы готовы отдать этой игре где-то день из своей жизни, то очень советую. В соло вы скорее всего с ума сойдёте)
И запомните, никогда не задумывайтесь над тем чтобы пройти это творение на все ачивки. 
Я вас предупредил) | Raft is a fun game with a unique and creative playstyle that kept me hooked at first. However, after around 15 hours of gameplay, it started to feel repetitive, leaving me questioning what else there was to explore or achieve. The grindy mechanics also stood out, as tools wore out quickly, batteries drained too fast, and the constant need for food and water became more of a chore than a challenge. While the initial experience is enjoyable, the gameplay loop could use more variety and balance to stay engaging in the long run. I really wish there was a neutral vote option because I don’t think this game deserves a negative review, but it doesn’t quite earn a full thumbs up either. | O melhor jogo de sobrevivência que joguei até o momento! Também é ótimo para jogar com os amigos e resenhar. Não gostei muito do modo história, pois achei um pouco parado, mas isso não me impediu de jogá-lo até o fim. O jogo tem muitas coisas para fazer e lugares para explorar. Recomendo para quem gosta sobrevivência!"

The only thing some people could find jarring is the art style, but honestly I found it a delight to look at. If you instead don't like the colors, there are options to change the colors.

奥伯拉丁号明明没能回归，为什么游戏名称叫作奥伯拉丁的回归呢？
因为，我就是奥伯拉丁的回归。 | Справжня детективна гра! Ще ніколи раніше я не грав в таку глибоко продуману загадку, де потрібно не поклікати на все підряд, а дійсно [b]додуматись[/b] до правильної відповіді. 
Ігролад наступний: ми знаходимо тіло людини і повертаємось в часі на момент її смерті, щоб детально оглянути, що сталось.
В цій грі потрібно ідентифікувати людей, що були на кораблі Obra Dinn та зʼясувати їхню долю. Для цього потрібно звернути увагу на одяг людини, на те, що в неї в руках, на її вираз обличчя і навіть на її акцент. Що в цей момент робила вона й оточуючі навколо? Мені було цікава це все співставляти й аналізувати, щоб потім так радіти від свого вірного припущення!
Це гра однієї людини з іменем Lucas Pope: програмування, дизайн, арт, звук та музика! 
Виконано тут все в дуже незвичній монохромній графіці, це надзвичайно стильно. Музика неймовірно добре підходить для кожного епізоду гри. Реплік героїв не багато, але вони всі на вагу золота для розвʼязку загадки, я здивований як тут підібрані актори з ідеальною вимовою такої класної англійської й акцентами інших мов.
Найскладніше особисто мені було розгадати [spoiler] корабельного стюарта Zungi Sathi і особливо причину його смерті.[/spoiler] Також було б не зовсім відверто не написати, що [spoiler] вже в самому кінці гри лишаються кілька не розгаданих персонажів, долю яких можна підібрати лише перебором. Ну як було розрізнити тих, хто випав за борт човна, а хто вижив і оселився в Африці?[/spoiler]
В деяких місцях гри мені було трохи страшно, що я щось пропущу чи не знайду як рухатись по сюжету далі, банально не знайду чиєсь тіло на кораблі.

Going to try the next installment because the first game was very enjoyable. | Если играли в We Were Here, то уже знаете, чего ожидать от игры. Простой игровой процесс с головоломками, которые максимально напрягут ваш мозг. Общение и совместная работа - единственный способ пройти игру.

Эту часть максимальный акцент сделали на описании прямо вот мельчайший деталей. Вы будете ОЧЕНЬ много говорить и скорее всего даже кричать. Не будет ни малейшего понятия, что именно видит другой человек. Таким образом, необходимо быть настолько изобретательным и тщательным в описании вашего окружения, насколько это вообще возможно. Крайне важно найти общий язык с вашим корешом. Иногда правильное действие определяется мельчайшими деталями, поэтому будьте готовы повторять вещи и убедитесь, что ваш тиммейт вас точно хорошо понял. Ну и так же головоломки на время, в которых один из вас может сгореть в какой нибудь лаве или еще куда нибудь упасть.

После того, как прошли игру, можно попробовать поменяться местами, чтобы увидеть, что ваш тиммейт видел раньше, а так же выбить недостающие ачивки. Но самое интересное, что второе прохождение, даже с тем что вы поменяетесь местами, займет до часу+-. Так же существует «секретная» концовка, которую я лично и не понял, потому что по итогу там все так же, как и в обычной. Игра пытается иметь какую то историю, в основном это загадочная, скрытная, потому что каждая часть игры проходит в каком то замке. Просто немного жуткая и не представляет собой ничего большего.

Довольная короткая часть и похожа максимально на предыдущую, только более интересными головоломками, но по времени все так же. Но в любом случае если вам нравятся логические головоломки и есть с кем играть, We Were Here Too это та самая игра и франчиза. Это одна из тех инди-игр, бюджет которой можно определить, просто взглянув на нее. Тем не менее, она убедительно доносит свою идею. Если все равно как то сомневаетесь, есть все так же бесплатная часть, чтобы понять, нравится ли вам подобное. Вдобавок ко всему, We Were Here Too стоит по скидке, как бутылка пива, по этому вижу здесь лишь одни плюсы.

Benim tek beğenmediğim nokta ana bosslar. Ana bosslar gerçekten zorlu ve hasarları felaket derecede yüksek. İlk 2 ana bossta bossun en ufak bir saldırısı canınızı ucunda bırakıyor. Sonra bir şekilde canı toplayıp bossu öldürebiliyorsunuz. Fakat 2. ana bosstan sonra canınızı ne kadar yükseltirseniz yükseltin boss hep tek atıyor. Tamam anlıyorum ana bossları co-op için yaptıkları çok bariz. Yüksek hp - yüksek hasar - bitmek bilmeyen saldırıları ve aynı anda sahaya çıkan yan düşmanlar. Resmen co-op için yapılmışlar belli yani. Bir tek final bossu beni şaşırttı. O kadar zorlayıcı ana bosslardan sonra final bossunun diğerlerine nazaran yarısı kadar bile zor olmayıp direk geçmem şaşırttı gerçekten.

Играл соло на максимально возможной сложности и закрыл игру на 100%, Если будешь играть с другом чисто для помеситься\побеситься, можешь даже не читать. :)

Очередной эксперимент в серии, который сделан любопытно, но к сожалению на отъебись:
Вечные втыки в текстуры; 
Элементы платформера в изометрической игре с инерцией после передвижения >:( ;
 У призыва коня и трансформации в форму\из формы хаоса нет анимации;
 Постоянные баги с интерфейсом: не появляется значок казни,  пропадают хп бары врагов, зависает интерфейс новых предметов (Монет, ключей, душ); 
У гравитационного выстрела анимация спешит, у заряженного не успевает, относительно полоски зарядки выстрела;
При переходе в\из режим\а ""В ударе"", Раздор не может ни казнить, ни стрелять;
Субтитры просто ужасны (Особенно в Русском (Какая нахуй Мамонна?! Вы что нахуй ёбнулись? >:( )) ;
Ужасно не хватает миникарты; Раскрываемая карта сделана ужасно;
Баланса в игре нет, при игре на хаосе с нуля, единственная проблема это жирный босс, которого ты ковыряешь дольше обычного. На апоке после прохождения вообще играть не интересно;
 При выходе из режима хаоса или анимации казни стабильно получаешь в ебало.

По лору эта часть происходит до 1ой игры, и по итогу что мы имеем:
Совет спиздил у Войны: Мёртвую хватку - переделав её в крюк и спрятав на земле; Глефу - спрятав её на земле; Перчатку - сделав её для другой руки и спрятав на земле.

Sometimes it's like solving a difficult math problem—feeling frustrated during the thought process when no solution seems to appear, but finally solving the problem brings a sense of clarity and a deep sense of accomplishment. | Absolute masterpiece of a game. You don't have to play long to recognise if the game is for you because the rules of the game are always so clear. The only thing that limits you is the rules you create, and it really makes you think about every move. If you enjoy puzzle games this is a must play because it makes you re think how you approach every puzzle making each level challenging and different in their own way.
On the surface it is simple but as you continue to play the game it will make you feel dumber and dumber, only to solve the puzzle and have a wash of relief and satisfaction come over you.
Highly recommend, 9/10 | 伟大的游戏。目前我最喜欢的类推箱子解谜游戏。
传统推箱子解谜在现代游戏逐渐式微的原因我认为是腾挪的反馈不高，关卡也很难做出独特性，一个关卡接一个关卡可能看起来都很相似（不是说设计不出来，而是设计所需要的难度更高——这方面做到极致的目前是Maxwell's puzzling demon）。Baba Is You重视思路而轻腾挪使得每一个关卡都更为有趣，能够表达的内容也更加丰富。 | This is an amazing puzzle game, and the best kind.  It's a very simple idea that allows for incredibly interesting and continually novel interactions among the parts of the game.  The art is simple but cute and each time I solve a puzzle I feel a genuine sense of achievement.  Unlike most puzzle games, the more difficult puzzles aren't made by simply putting more moving parts into the machine and making things complicated, but instead are increasingly clever applications of existing methods and occasional additions of new methods.

The core idea is that each level has rules that are set by simple sentences built out of blocks of text.  BABA IS YOU, for instance, means that the player controls Baba.  If you push any part of that sentence out of the way, it breaks, and you no longer control Baba.  Depending on how you push the text, that could mean you've failed the round or it could mean that now you've got control of a key, or a rock, or something else entirely.  The player has to figure out how to use, or more often change, existing rules in order to reach the winning condition.  It's surprisingly fun and challenging. | This is a phenomenal game but very hard, I highly recommend playing with a hint page or even two open and not being ashamed to check them most levels later in the game. I've been following the hints on a blog called keyofw which does good subtle hints, then when their hints are too subtle checking a YouTube playlist called ""Baba is you- solutions- walkthrough"" by Alayric, which has allowed me to finish nearly all the levels but still get the joy of figuring things out half the time or more."

Хочу поделиться своими мыслями как можно сделать игру более страшной и интересной, вам наверняка должно понравиться ;) 
 Я предлагаю добавить больше скримеров, неожиданных и чтобы они не было привязанными к типу призрака. К приму вот эти :
  1. Чтобы неожиданно из-за угла мог выглядывать чей-то силует, а когда ты его замечаешь, тот он пропадает 
  2. Чтобы в окнах могли появляться различные сущности или сам призрак 
  3. Чтобы призрак или существо могло появляться на кроватях и смотреть из-под одеяла на игрока 
  4. Чтобы призрак мог неожиданно заглянуть в камеру и это было видно на мониторе в фургоне 
  5. Чтобы призрак мог издавать случайные звуки, по типу смеха или его подобного 
 Если так посмотреть, то игру можно развить до фантастиких маштабов и это лишь мало что можно придумать
 | Phasmaphobia is hands-down one of the best co-op horror experiences out there. The atmosphere is chilling, the ghost AI is smart (and sometimes terrifying), and the jump scares feel earned. Playing with friends and watching them freak out while you try to stay calm (or not) never gets old. Every round feels like a mix of strategy and chaos, and I love how the game forces you to work together while keeping you on edge.

The maps are great and offer a lot of variety, but after a while, you start to memorize every nook and cranny. Adding new maps, maybe as DLC or even as a free update, would keep things feeling fresh for veterans who’ve sunk hours into ghost hunting. Imagine a haunted amusement park or an old cruise ship... that would be next-level terrifying.

If you’re into horror or co-op games, this is a must-play. Just be prepared to question every creak and groan in your house after a long night of ghost hunts. Seriously, grab some friends and give this game a go—you won’t regret it. 👻 | Phasmophobia is a truly unique game, unlike anything I've played before. Unfortunately, the community can be rough on newbies; I've been kicked from more lobbies than I can count just because I'm not high-level yet. But, if you score a good group or have friends to team up with, it's an experience you've got to try.

Now, I'm not one for completing all tasks or nailing that perfect investigation; I'm simply here for the fun of figuring out the ghost type whilst being hunted. Sadly, the majority of players seem to be after achievements etc. and therefore the key is to find players who vibe with your style, or you might find yourself booted out more often than not.

The community aside, however, this is a great game that's still going strong after so many years—a testament to its niche offering in a typically over-saturated gaming market. | great game, unfortunately disappointed that the ghost does not edge you at 42 edgefield"

I find the game amazing especially with the story drive aspect, as the game went on I got far more interested in the story than I was in the puzzles and I think the story is what really makes this game shine, this games story single handedly makes the other games in the series that much better for what it does."

76561198041304371,209670,Cortex Command,0.0,"Action, Indie, Strategy",0,"A great game left out in the rain by the developers. You can get the whole game for free and open source since the original creators did put out the code themself. I was really debating on if giving this a positive or negative rating was better, in the end is up to you how you spend money. The workshop is great so I would understand if that was a deciding factor. Personally I have no gripes with the game, only annoying thing they put in it was adverts for Planetoid Pioneers inside it. Planetoid Pioneers being the game that killed people's respect of the developers as it was shortly abandoned too.

Another reason I found it hard to review Cortex Command is trying to fit the gameplay in to a single genre. This has RTS aspects with the economy and battles, but it is also a very chill base builder. It has its economic managment phase, but also the abilily to gather and store wealth during battles for later use. If I was really forced to I would call it something it would be a 2D RTS with a strategy campaing in order to show the results of what you and the AI has made of the planet during corporate warfare. You really need to see it in order to get it.

Any negative review either mentions one of two things. One Data Realms behavior of abounding games and still selling a inferior bug ridden mess (I mean why buy this instead of downloading it for free?). Two the jank of this title. What makes Cortex Command so great is the engine, the terrain and units and vehicles all can be destroyed pixel by pixel. This can ofcourse lead to problems, you could get stuck on your own dead units or a mere pixel in the way. You could be thrown half across the battle field. You could even just die from something you didn't see. Yes there are a lot of crashes. I also  feel the only challange comes from the AI's ability to spam units and have them act on their own, out matches the player's ability to multitask and the rather piss poor auto commands you can give. For one player climbing is a pinch, for another is a unresolvable problem in the code.

The positive aspects is that the code is out there, and I have never seen as impressive mods as I have with this title. You can play with units and vechiles at such a size it boggles the mind. Nothing will preaper you from the joy of seeing all your carnage, wreckages, old fortifcations and corpses remaning battle from battle. I can't count how many times I even destroyed my own units to add flavor to the terrain is just that cool looking (the Star Destroyer being my personal favorite sprite). Some mods just makes this a whole different game, Void Wanderers is so good it could be sold on its own. Is also very natural how you control units and build, I had no problem learning to play on my own and unlike others never experinced any real issues with climbing ladders or interacting with items. No other games really gives me the feel anything I want is possible. | У меня с другом было наиграно сотни часов после учебы ))) С модами было очень весело играть. Сейчас уже все мертво и никому не нужно | Удивительная Игра. Просто ИЗУМИТЕЛЬНО!

Одна из не многих игр с симуляцией физики такого уровня и уж тем более такого типа. А конкретнее симуляцией каждого пикселя. Мне безумно понравился Сетинг, Карты, Оружие, Ванильные Фракции. Но к сожалению, игра давно была заброшена Разработчиками в якобы ""релизе"", а наследник оказался мягко говоря паршивым. Потому я всё же перешёл на ОпенСурс версию с до работанным движком, механиками и балансом. Спасибо Комьюнити за то, что всё ещё поддерживаете игру!

However, if the new DEV team sticks with it, it will continue to grow. It's just a matter of continuing to push updates out and improving the engine (eventually at least to Unreal 4). The fact that people mistake this for Fortnite, constantly, because they would have looked the same in a year long past now, means it's popular enough to even be referenced against. Hitboxes are HUGE. The game allows you to be 'bad' but still be an okay player.

Crossplay is the only way to go right now as if you don't, you may not find a lobby to play in. Peak hours of filled lobbies seem to be between Noon CST till around 7pm. That's way better than how it was where it seemed 'dead' all the time.

IMO there's a LOT that still needs to be done. The former 'pros' still destroy people and if they continue to campy camp newer or just plain NEW players to this game, they'll not want to come back. Only way to really fix that is SBMM or add different modes like specifically ranked for the pros that want to fight others on their level and/or public type lobbies (like many other BR's have). I know that's probably way down the road, but it's going to have to happen to draw the players that can only play a couple hours a night because of their busy lives (aka casuals).

They've put some work into the new skins. New Battle Pass with this last update in November. New class, or rather a class brought back from Alpha. Rumors of another new class down the line. Ultimately people just have to have an interest in this game and there are a few creators that play this game that are IN FACT promoting the crap out of it. All in all, it's a fun little BR to get away from the others that are more 'serious' IMO. If you're just wanting a 'getaway' BR, then this one might hook you in once you learn the classes and get to know the small community that comes with this game. | Removeram os servidores da América do Sul....

Между самой первой We Were Here, которая была просто милой маленькой бесплатной инди-игрой, и второй частью, которая вышла относительно не давно и раздавалась бесплатно для привлечения внимания, так понимаю. Действительно можно видеть улучшения. Глядя на Together, можно видеть, что деньги, которые получили разработчики, были вложены в хорошие руки, и это напрямую перешло в качество.

Игра значительно улучшилась, ну в основном с точки зрения графики и повествования в катсценах. Геймплей не сильно изменился, а внесенные изменения были в основном просто ответами на проблемы, которые, возникали у большинства людей в предыдущих играх.

В целом, это отличная игра-головоломка для всех. Если у вас есть друг, с которым вы просто хотите провести время и на удивление немного подумать и воспользоваться логикой, то вы оказались в отличном месте. Без сомнений, одна из лучших логических игр, в которые мне довелось играть. Определенно стоит своих денег.

Из минусов могу отметить лишь только, то что очень странно работает система чата для общение в игре, оно то работает без рации, то только с рацией(при чем когда рядом два перса находятся близко или наоборот далеко, то слышно, то не слышно без рации, вообщем не понятно). Изначально хотелось пройти игру с игровым голосовым чатом, но встретившись с каким то багами с этим, решили все же играть просто в дс.

Сами головоломки различаются и много разнообразия, что действительно интересно их разгадывать, даже если иногда не понимаешь. Первая головоломка - это просто найти скрытые объекты с несколькими вентелями, но после этого вам быстро придется работать параллельно с вашим другом, чтобы выяснить, что вам нужно сделать дальше, и почти каждая головоломка будет чрезвычайно утомительной и самое интересное, бывают некоторые головомки, где одному приходится больше думать и взаимодействовать, а второму лишь передавать информацию, а иногда все сразу одновременно. Первая область просто готовит игроков к совместному тим-ворку, но после этого момента We Were Here Together разделяет обоих игроков и все же окутывает их несколькими головоломками, над которыми придется работать одновременно. Это может быть что угодно, от серии лифтов, которые каким-то образом связаны, до моста, который соединен со странной табличкой, которую игрокам придется разгадать. Либо на время быстро, что то сделать, ибо ваш друг умрёт.

В целом я настоятельно рекомендую эту игру любителям головоломок или тем, кто хочет играть в кооперативе. Это точно маст хев.

buenardo | Chapter 8 is severely bugged. The room straight up doesn't load some of the puzzle elements for one of the pair, and the elements that load are bugged (but not in an obvious enough way to make sure that you can understand that it is bugged). Me and my companion spent over 1hr30min just on that room alone, getting more and more frustrated, until I finally decided to search for the solution online... And the first result is a post from 4 years ago in Reddit explaining the exact same bug we encountered. This game is still being sold. There was never a bug fix. My faith on attempting to actually solve any of the future puzzles is completely gone, because now if any puzzles are too hard, me and my companion will just assume that it is bugged.

Maybe it's needing to invest level upgrades into just having more troops.  Maybe it's the arbitrary caps on how many troops can be in a stack.

It's quite decent, everything works quite well - and that's it. The writing is half-assed with a bunch of unbearable fantasy tropes. The battles are satisfying and quick, but simple. The pixel graphics looked wonderful in videos, but they look terrible on my 4K large screen. I turned off the zoomed-in last kill of the battle because it was just a jumbled mess. I don't have anything against pixel graphics, recently I played Dave the Diver and thought it was gorgeous.

But the biggest offender was the city building. It's a complete mess, unintuitive, cumbersome, boring and ugly. Managing your kingdom is just tiresome. I tried coming back to the game after six months, but I just can't get into it.

A fun powertrip that balances difficulty well and a spells out a very unique and interesting universe. | Juegazo sin duda, me lo disfrute mucho tiene una historia muy buena, y lo mas interesante que esta conectado con Alan Wake, tiene mecanicas muy buenas 10/10 | Control — це унікальний шутер від третьої особи від студії Remedy Entertainment, яка подарувала нам такі ігри, як Max Payne (грав) і Alan Wake ( не знайомий з серією). Ця гра поєднує в собі загадковий сюжет, химерний світ і захоплюючий ігровий процес, створюючи щось абсолютно неповторне. 

[h3] Сюжет і атмосфера [/h3]
Події гри розгортаються у Федеральному бюро контролю (FBC) — таємничій урядовій організації, яка займається паранормальними явищами. Гравець бере на себе роль Джессі Фейден, яка шукає свого зниклого брата. Вона опиняється в штаб-квартирі бюро, відомій як Найстаріший Будинок — будівлі, що змінює форму і не підкоряється законам фізики.

Джессі несподівано отримує посаду директора бюро й виявляє, що місце заражене паранормальним феноменом, відомим як ""Шепіт"" (The Hiss). Гра майстерно розкриває сюжет через документи, записи, загадкові діалоги та дослідження світу, занурюючи в атмосферу науково-фантастичного хорору. Remedy створила світ, який водночас лякає і зачаровує. 

[h3] Геймплей [/h3]
Головна особливість Control — це неймовірно динамічний ігровий процес. Джессі володіє пістолетом-перетворювачем, який змінює форму й функції, але головна родзинка гри — це її паранормальні здібності. Гравець може використовувати телекінез, кидати предмети у ворогів, створювати щити з уламків і навіть левітувати.

Бойова система чудово реалізована: кожна сутичка відчувається як динамічний танець, де потрібно швидко ухилятися, атакувати й використовувати оточення для переваги. Противники, заражені ""Шепотом"", відрізняються як візуально, так і за поведінкою, що робить бої цікавими.

Окремо варто відзначити дизайн рівнів. Найстаріший Будинок — це величезна метафізична структура, де кожна кімната виглядає унікально. Гравець відкриває нові області, отримуючи здібності й ключі доступу, що робить гру схожою на метроїдванію.

[h3] Візуал і звук [/h3]
Control — це технічний і художній шедевр. Гра використовує рушій Northlight і підтримує технології на кшталт трасування променів (Ray Tracing), що додає реалістичності відображенням і світлу. Кожна деталь візуально пропрацьована: від розлітаючихся уламків до сюрреалістичних змін середовища.

Звуковий дизайн заслуговує окремої похвали. Напружена музика і незвичайні аудіоефекти підсилюють відчуття тривоги, а голоси ""Шепоту"", які іноді чутно під час гри, додають напруженості.

[h3] Недоліки [/h3]
Control не позбавлена недоліків. Деякі гравці можуть вважати, що сюжет залишає забагато питань без відповідей, а для тих, хто не любить шукати записки й документи, може здатися, що історія занадто розпорошена.

[h3] 100% досягнень [/h3]
Тут можна сказати небагато для любителів проходити ігри на 100%, то всі досягнення можно отримати за одне проходження, складності в них немає.

[h3] Висновок [/h3]
Control — це сміливий експеримент, який поєднує стильний дизайн, незабутню атмосферу та інноваційний геймплей. Гра вимагає від гравця уваги до деталей і готовності зануритися в загадковий світ. Хоча вона може здатися трохи важкою для тих, хто любить прямолінійний сюжет, для фанатів інтригуючих історій і паранормальних загадок це справжній подарунок.
Проходи гру тому що порекомендував друг і він був прав гра крутезна, тому і проходив її на одному подиху. Всім добра.

[h1] Оцінка: 9/10 [/h1]
Це гра, яку не варто пропускати, якщо ви любите атмосферні та інноваційні проєкти. | I would 100% recommend this to gamers that like games like the Bioshock series, Prey, Atomic Heart etc. It's very unique game with a lot of cool stuff.

Lots to explore, 12 hours in on first playthrough i probably touched the surface
Interesting worldbuilding and cool systems
Can be very addictive once you've gotten used to the system

Cons: 
- Many tasks feel like grinding. A lot of repetitiveness, be it work, reading books or studying skills. E.g. to improve your [spoiler]  ""reason"" [/spoiler] skill you have to  combine 8 [spoiler] ""Erudition"" [/spoiler]  which takes 60 seconds each to combine, and 60 seconds to make, all on timers before they run out... 

- The way cards get added to your field sucks ass and is beyond annoying, just dumping them wherever with no possibility to have a dedicated place for a certain type of card. Let me have all books in one place, all vitality in another etc... being unable to stack cards with different timers is also extremly annoying and creates a mess all the time. 

Overall, a 6/10 which would be probably a 7 or 8 if the quality of life wasn't so miserable at points. 

If you like management in games | This game is a passionate love affair I keep coming back to.  It's not something I recommend to everyone (honestly I don't think any game is, but this one is more ""has a highly specific target audience"" than most) - you have to be some combination of a fiddly detail obsessive, wiki-diver, and opaque lore-enjoyer to really get the most out of it.  

Watching the previews will give a decent sense of the actual gameplay, which I would have difficulty describing, but the *feeling* of playing the game can't really be communicated as easily, I think.  Cultist Sim is incredibly atmospheric, and a lot better at creating interesting tension than a few gameplay clips can really convey.  The timer progression is such an integral part of not just the mechanics, but the mood.  Is your current Dream action (20 seconds remaining) going to turn up the card you need to dispel part of the Fascination counter (45 seconds remaining) currently spelling your doom?  etc.  

Also, it pays to actually read the descriptive text on things - it will all sound like pretentious bullshit at first, but there is a kind of shockingly cohesive, deep, and interesting setting and story going on, here, behind all the timer-watching.

My one main criticism is that it is really, really bad at teaching you how to play it.  I'd recommend spending a few minutes on youtube to help get the basics down; there are a lot of aspects of the game that are satisfying to find out in an exploratory manner, but the basics of stuff like, how to recruit and promote Followers are not that.  Thankfully, the fan wiki is also excellent, and basically an essential resource if you get in deep."

Its alright, theres just better out there including  in the franchise | Years of XCOM franchise and worldbuilding gone to waste through typical American hero action movie vibes and limited gameplay. The game is repetitive, too long for the same ol' same ol' type of writing it introduces, and it's progression is very limited.

Best time to buy this game is at a large discount, otherwise chances are you will regret it. | The gameplay is great. XCOM, but your cops in the aftermath of the invasion. Where it differes greatly is the characters, specifically, their characters that were created and each have unique abilities. It's a shorter game than the other XCOMs, so it makes sense, and all the characters are unique and pretty fun. However if you have come here for the store, it's kind of just okay. It's nothing horrible, it's just bland. 

If you really like XCOM gameplay, it's a fun mix of gameplay. If you're here for an interesting story, than this isn't gonna do it. It's not as hard as the other XCOMs, but that doesn't mean it's easy. | bleh. This game is like ""We have XCOM 2 at home"" walmart off-brand version. Just a massive letdown compared to both it's predecessors. I know people say that this game isn't a true successor to XCOM 2 and that's it's apples to oranges, but these apples are spoiled with worms in them. I can't recommend it | As a long time X-Com fan I felt offended by this product. I can’t call it a game. A game, by definition is an activity that one engages in for amusement or fun, This  is not engaging, arguably fun. This is a product created, packed and sold with the minimum effort just to pursue a specific agenda and, unfortunately, has the name of a very cool franchise on it.
The ONLY “ok” aspect of this product is the gameplay. Breaching games are extremely rare and the idea of having an alien and human swat team doing police business it was interesting and it was the biggest appeal for me. Small maps, quick actions, repetitive gameplay loop but with different variations? Why not. Troubleshooter is one of my favorite game and it doesn’t even have a breach mode.
Too bad the rest of the product is awful. It’s not “bad”, it’s “awful”. If you want a TLDR and you get the reference, this product can be called “X-Com Velma (2023 HBO)”.
You no longer have a squad of nobodies who are trying their best to save the world, you have a pre-selected team of aliens and humans which are only walking tropes, generally uninteresting, assholes or constantly judging hypocrites. Or any combination of the former. The “characters” interactions are just Marvel quipping (in missions and during rest time) and they have no in-between moral position. They are “I am so tolerant look at me” “I was on your side all the time” “I didn’t deserve this” or “I am a dumb racist”. You can say I’ve played two hours so I can’t really judge an eventual “character development”. No wait I have internet, I can because I’ve read everything about this product so yeah I can judge.
They made me hate a snake lady. I will never forgive them for this.
Also those awful portraits and general art style. Just why. And why they changed the mutton this much? This is X-Com not Lilo and Stich.
But that’s not even the worst point. No, the worst point is the only moral of the product: RACISM BAD. Now don’t put out the pitchforks yet. There is a teeny bitsy little thing to add.
RACISM (against the aliens that enslaved humanity, killed literally millions, put people in concentration camps and use them as food or slave labor or genetic experiments and had a unit 731 in every human city) BAD.
I want also to point out only FIVE years have been passed since X-Com 2 events. You remember how American people were so tolerant and friendly with Japanese after WW2? Or the polish with the Germans? Or the Chinese with the Japanese? Everybody knows we humans are a wonderful and tolerant race.
The product has the moral high ground to judge ANYONE who is against the established order RACIST BAD. There is no compromise, they are RACIST so you have to kill them on sight.
The bad guys are so comically evil, kids Sunday morning cartoons evil. They have no layers, they are bad, they do bad things you MUST hate them. You want more info? No, they are evil, they do bad things.
This is also a detriment for the gameplay. In SWAT games, literally and the genre, you are usually punished to shoot without warning or for cheap violence. You are there to arrest and defuse potential harm to civilians. That’s not the case, fuck them racist, kill ‘em all. 
In X-Com you have to kill on sight because there is a WAR on the background. Here you are in peace times. This product literally endorse police violence and brutality just because “they are racists man, they deserve it”. Oh but they are really smart pointing out “you are not the police”. You are acting like police, you are addressed as a police force, you are arresting and killing people in critical felony or criminal situations but nono, you are not the police.
Yes I know the aliens in X-Com are basically other alien races enslaved against their will. I know. But the product shouts in my hear 24\7 JUST ACCEPT IT. People MUST ACCEPT aliens in position of power, all over the media, basically having more power than humans. People MUST BE FRIENDLY WITH THEM OR BE KILLED OR ARRESTED. You really want me to believe in a democratic election an ALIEN won the major race. We have ALIEN social media “influencers”, cops are aliens, aliens in position of power. After all that happened? And everyone against this is “bad” by definition.
This is not even suspension of disbelief, this is insane agenda pushing. And we are not even talking about a world war, economic, political crisis. We are talking about the total enslavement of humanity, people eaten as FOOD and cruel abhorrent genetic experimentation. But yes, humans tend to forgive we are all happy under the rainbow.
This product had so much potential but they had to destroy it just to get woke\agenda\sjw\whatever pick your demon points creating the most absurd and incoherent worldbuilding over a 10+ games established franchise.
I played almost the two hours legal term for a refund, I looked on the internet for every info of the product I needed and I asked a refund for a product I paid 1 (one) euro because I don’t even want to see it in my list. Because those devs and this kind of product don’t deserve even ONE euro.
This is how mad I am with this awful product that probably is the last X-Com we will ever have."
76561198041304371,892970,Valheim,23.633333333333333,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Early Access",0,"Игра класс,если не считать что тебя ебут каждый раз как ты переходишь на новый биом особенно запомнились комарики как дроны шахиды которые летят в тебя и уёбывают тебя на половину хп ,и замечательный биом туманные земли где видно только на 5см вперед себя и замечательный ландшафт где ты просто ходишь по стенам,надеюсь разрабы живут в таком же биоме,всем советую | Valheim has become a cherished part of our family time since its release, and we often find ourselves diving into new adventures during the holidays. Each of my three boys brings a unique flair to our gameplay: one loves to explore the seas with our trusty boats, another dives headfirst into danger, pushing us to gather resources in the most perilous biomes, while the youngest shines as our master base builder. We all contribute to the game in our own ways, but it’s clear to see each of our preferences. For me, Valheim truly checks all the boxes for an engaging and immersive experience. | [h1] Valheim: отличные идеи, зажатые в рамках искусственных ограничений. [/h1]

Valheim — это замечательный сурвайвал, в котором идеально сочетаются исследование и строительство. Игра впечатляет своим графическим стилем и атмосферным саунд-дизайном, погружая в мир викингов. Казалось бы, всё для идеальной игры на месте. Но чем дольше играешь, тем больше замечаешь, что разработчики будто намеренно вставляют тебе палки в колёса. Тут почти каждая механика не просто усложняет тебе жизнь, а делает это максимально раздражающе.

[h2] Инвентарь и грузоподъемность: гениальные решения.[/h2]
В игре у персонажа 32 слота инвентаря. Казалось бы, что этого достаточно. Но 10-12 из них заняты экипировкой (броня, оружие, инструменты и стрелы). Выходишь из дома, а треть инвентаря [b]уже забита[/b], а в оставшиеся слоты моментально попадает случайный хлам: семена, смола, ягоды, шкуры, мясо, камни, дерево. Никаких рюкзаков/сумок или отдельных слотов под броню и оружие в игре нет. То есть получить дополнительные ячейки инвентаря мы никак не можем (без модов). Далее, вы ограничены по весу предметов. Да, это логично, но весовые ограничения смехотворно маленькие, а металлы (в том числе руда) [b]ВЕСЯТ ДОХРЕНА.[/b]
Единственный способ увеличить переносимый вес — это пояс, который можно купить у торговца. Конечно найдите его сперва, а потом накопите золота на покупку. А теперь внимание: пояс занимает слот [b]аксессуара.[/b] А что еще вешается в этот слот? О, всего-лишь важные предметы, которые помогут вам в других поздних биомах! Например, душка с болот, без которой трудно искать серебро, или светлячок, без которого туманные земли — сплошное бельмо на экране. И как вишенка на торте: металлы и руды (а так же ядра суртлинга и некоторые другие ВАЖНЫЕ предметы) нельзя переносить через порталы! Вы любите гринд? Вам придется переть руду на телеге по ужасным дорогам или плавать на корабле, рискуя утонуть с грузом. Причём разработчики ввели возможность перебрасывать металлы через порталы... но только в самом конце игры, когда это уже не нужно! Ну класс, спасибо!

[h2]Сундуки: вам их понадобится слишком много.[/h2]
10 слотов в стандартном деревянном сундуке — это смех. При этом нормальные сундуки открываются на более поздних стадиях игры, но требуют ресурсы, которые нужны для крафта оружия и снаряжения (армированный сундук 24 слота, сундук из черного металла 32). А сундуков нужно просто [b]ТОННЫ,[/b] потому что инвентарь маленький, переносимый вес крошечный, а ресурсов требуется очень много. В итоге на базе ты чувствуешь себя не викингом, а скорее кладовщиком.

[h2]Крафт и грейды: готовьтесь гриндить.[/h2]
Создание оружия и брони — это нормально, я это даже приветствую. Но вот их улучшение превращается в ад. Например, чтобы прокачать железный меч до максимального уровня, нужно 80 железа. Для этого вам нужно перенести около 800 единиц веса на собственном горбу до плавильни. Это в 2,5 раза больше, чем может носить персонаж!. Давайте возьмем другой пример — меч грейдом пониже, бронзовый. Для его крафта и полного грейда нужно 32 бронзы. Вроде бы не много, да? Но бронза производится из меди и олова по соотношению 2 к 1. То есть нам нужно 64 меди и 32 олова, а это почти 900 единиц веса нужно будет перенести у себя в кармашке до плавильни! При максимальной грузоподъемности персонажа в 300!!! А ведь железо потом нужно будет добывать в болотах, таскать его пешком или на корабле... и всё это ради каких-то +7 к урону?
Представляете сколько беготни туда-сюда вам предстоит? И так абсолютно со всеми металлами. Любой грейд требует чудовищного количества ресурсов, растягивая игровой процесс до абсурда. Разработчики явно решили, что игроки не должны получать удовольствие, а должны страдать.
[b]Разбор предметов? Да не, сжигайте их к чертям.[/b] Вам больше не нужна старая дубинка, топор или кирка? Разберите их на ресурсы. А, стоп, нельзя? Можно только уничтожить? Да и то, только если вы скрафтите специальную постройку. Окей... логично... наверное.

[h2]Выравнивание земли — настоящее испытание.[/h2]
Хотите построить красивую базу? Будьте готовы к тому, что выравнивание земли — худшая механика в игре. Оно работает ужасно криво, требует кучу времени и [strike]нервов[/strike] стамины, а идеальной ровности добиться очень сложно. Каждый раз, когда ты пытаешься сделать ровную поверхность, игра будто издевается над тобой. А так же, как по мне, генерация ландшафта в игре через чур холмистая, что тоже наваливает проблем. Если бы механика выравнивания работала лучше или хотя бы была возможность проще находить более ровные участки для строительства, это сильно упростило бы процесс и сделало бы игру менее раздражающей в этом аспекте. Особенно учитывая, сколько времени и ресурсов уходит на выравнивание. Особенно сильно в этом плане напрягает постоянная нехватка стамины. О, кстати о ней.

[h2]Стамина, которая кончается моментально, восстанавливается вечность.[/h2]
Стамина в игре расходуется на всё: бег, прыжки, плавание, перекаты, атаки, стрельбу из лука, блок, строительство, выравнивание земли, работу в огороде и много еще на что.
Идея классная, но баланс — тихий ужас. Стамина тратится [b]КАТАСТРОФИЧЕСКИ[/b] быстро и восстанавливается очень медленно. Да, в игре есть бафф бодрости, который ускоряет её реген, но максимальная длительность этого баффа около 30 минут. Если комфорт минимальный, то он длится... [b]ВОСЕМЬ[/b] минут. При чём есть куча дебаффов, которые режут реген (например холод и сырость). В итоге ты постоянно выдыхаешься, что замедляет твоё развитие. Любая активность превращается в мучение.

[h2]Еда: вечный голод — вечная проблема.[/h2]
Да, в игре из-за голода вы не умрете, но еда дает временные бонусы к ХП и стамине. Мне нравится эта механика, но проблема в том, что эффект быстро ослабевает. Вот ты наготовил себе стак мяса, покушал, пошел делать дела. Спустя 10 минут эффект от мяса ослабевает на столько, что ты вынужден съесть еще. А потом еще и еще. В итоге ты вечно голоден, вечно жрешь и постоянно добываешь новые продукты, потому что старые кончаются быстрее, чем ты успеваешь вздохнуть. Да продлите вы эффект от еды, ей богу, 20 минут это катастрофически мало.

[h2]Кузницы, верстаки и плавильни: зачем их столько?[/h2]
Ты доходишь до нового биома, у тебя появляется новая кузница/верстак/плавильня... но старые по прежнему нужны!
Новая плавильня выглядит круто, но не может переплавлять медь, олово и железо, только черный металл и огнеметалл. Почему? Какого черта? Новая кузница не заменяет старую, а просто становится дополнительной. Почему бы не сделать один универсальный плавильный агрегат? Новый верстак? Да, но старый тоже остается, потому что без него старые рецепты недоступны. В итоге у тебя база превращается в какой-то завод, заставленный разными станками и печками.

[h2]Итог.[/h2]
Valheim — это игра с потрясающей атмосферой, но чудовищно неудобными геймплейными решениями. У игры огромный потенциал, но вместо того чтобы сделать её сложной, разработчики сделали её попросту неудобной. Здесь слишком много лишних ограничений и искусственного усложнения: маленький инвентарь, ограниченный переносимый вес, невозможность переносить руду через порталы, бесконечный гринд, неудобные сундуки... Всё это не делает игру интереснее, это просто раздражает. Да, можно отключить рейды мобов, можно включить перенос руды через порталы, но почему я должен вручную исправлять неудобства, которые были добавлены в игру намеренно?
Если вам нравится страдать, эта игра для вас. Если нет — готовьтесь терпеть жесточайший гринд или ищите моды, которые исправят глупые ограничения. Игра предлагает вам стать викингом, но вместо боёв и приключений ты большую часть времени проводишь, таская руду, копаясь в сундуках и страдая от перегруза. | Hiç istemeyerek girip hiç çıkmak istemediğim bir oyun oldu aşırı keyif verici arkadaşlarla ve türünün en iyisi oyun içi içeriği aşırı dolu boş vakit geçirmiyorsun oyunda öyle bir oyun düşünün ara ara aklınıza geliyor Valheim başlayalım diyorsunuz . | Really simple but pretty game.

I personally have gotten a lot of mileage out of using Zoner classes like the Sage and the Psykino to disrupt enemy movement and hit them with psy orbs floating around the snake, similar to a challenge run in Binding of Issac. Heroes have a set number of hit points and cooldown on their powers, and losing enough HP boots them out of your snake, You get any fallen heroes back after every stage, as well as a shop to spend money you've earned on upgrades and new heroes.

(i have dyslexia) | [h2]Sinopsis[/h2]
Simmiland es un juego de estrategia y gestión de cartas/recursos, en el que jugaremos a ser Dios. Dales vida a tus pequeños humanos, moldea el entorno a tu antojo y proporcionales recursos, ayúdales a desarrollar nuevas tecnologías y crecer, tanto en número como en inteligencia. Empuja a tu civilización hasta alcanzar el espacio y las estrellas o fracasa estrepitosamente, dejando que el hambre y la enfermedad arramblen con todo, tú decides!

[h2]Jugabilidad / Apartado técnico[/h2]
Comenzamos en una isla desierta y un par de humanos. En nuestra mano tendremos una serie de cartas de diferentes tipos: recursos (plantas, árboles y minerales), meteorología (sol, lluvia, viento, etc), seres vivos (humanos y animales), acciones (inspeccionar y muestrear) o catástrofes (muerte y epidemia). Las cartas meteorológicas modificarán el entorno, creando o destruyendo distintos biomas. Los recursos generan materias primas y pueden variar según el bioma donde los usemos. Las acciones nos proporcionarán nuevas ideas o recetas para el desarrollo de la civilización, así como el incremento de su inteligencia. Estas cartas podrán usarse en todo momento, pero para ello necesitaremos “Fe”, un elemento que obtendremos cumpliendo los deseos de nuestros colonos. Por supuesto, deberemos poner especial atención en recursos como el alimento, ya que si los humanos pasan hambre morirán.
Por lo tanto, el juego consiste en usar nuestras cartas para ir creando nuevos recursos que nuestros humanos puedan emplear según su voluntad (no podemos controlarlos). Gestionar el alimento, aumentar la población, cumplir sus deseos para obtener Fe y empujarlos a que investiguen nuevas tecnologías e incrementen su intelecto, creando nuevas herramientas y edificios hasta llegar al futuro. Pero ojo, conseguir una correcta gestión no es sencillo, siendo probable que acabemos colapsando la civilización por hambre, enfermedades o falta/exceso de Fe. Sí, un exceso de Fe provocará que los humanos desarrollen la religión, bloqueando su inteligencia e impidiéndonos seguir avanzando. El juego nos ofrece además dos modos: el “clásico”, con un numero limitado de cartas y un final, y el “infinito”, donde podrás jugar hasta hartarte (o fracasar).

[h2]Valoración[/h2]
Simmiland es un juego tremendamente sencillo, tranquilo y gratificante de jugar, que invita a la experimentación y a la prueba/error. La cantidad de recursos, herramientas y tecnologías disponibles es enorme, así como los detalles y originales ideas que ofrece, haciendo muy amena y entretenida cada partida. Además, el juego ofrece unos gráficos simples y coloridos, así como una música alegre que invitan a pasar varias horas delante del ordenador. Simmiland, al igual que otros títulos de Sokpop, es un juego breve y conciso, un concepto que, sin ser demasiado ambicioso, nos ofrece algo diferente y ameno de jugar. Al ser un juego de estrategia y desarrollo lento da para muchas horas, especialmente si jugamos a ciegas y nos dejamos sorprender, experimentando con cada carta. En mi caso he invertido más de 30 horas para superar el 100%.
Lo salvaría de un incendio! 👨‍🚒👍🔥

[b]Сюжет и атмосфера:[/b]
[i]Сюжет игры Among Us начинается с возвращения межзвездного космического корабля домой после опасного путешествия. Часть команды заражена инопланетными мозговыми паразитами, которые превращают их в саботажников с жаждой убийства.

Мирные космонавты должны выполнять задания для восстановления работоспособности корабля и выявлять предателей, чтобы избавиться от них. Саботажники же стремятся убить мирных игроков и саботировать системы корабля, оставаясь при этом незамеченными.

Игра сочетает элементы психологического триллера, где напряжение и подозрения постоянно нарастают, а ключевые обсуждения и разоблачения происходят на общих собраниях команды.[/i]

[b]Геймплей:[/b]
[i]Основная цель игры — выполнять задания или саботажи, а также выявлять и устранять предателей среди членов экипажа. Игроки делятся на две команды: члены экипажа и предатели.

 | [b]Among Us took the gaming world by storm, proving that sometimes, the simplest games create the most unforgettable moments. Whether you're completing tasks like a diligent crewmate or plotting deception as an imposter, this game is all about strategy, teamwork, and betrayal.

The gameplay is easy to understand but leads to intense, hilarious, and sometimes frustrating interactions. One moment, you're quietly fixing wires, and the next, you're passionately defending yourself in an emergency meeting after being falsely accused. The mix of deduction and deception makes every round unpredictable and fun.

What makes Among Us special is the social experience. It thrives on communication (and miscommunication), whether you're playing with friends or random players. The joy of convincing others to vote someone off, only to realize they were innocent, creates endless entertainment.

Visually, it's simple and colorful, with cute character designs that contrast the brutal reality of getting ejected into space. The sound design, from the satisfying task completion beeps to the ominous kill animations, adds to the tension.

While Among Us is at its best with a group of friends, public lobbies can be hit-or-miss, depending on how people play. The game has also evolved with new roles, maps, and customization options, keeping things fresh for long-time players.

In conclusion, Among Us is a fantastic party game that blends strategy and chaos in the best way possible. It’s proof that great multiplayer experiences don’t need complex mechanics—just a solid concept and the right group of people. If you love games that test friendships and create hilarious memories, this one’s a must-play![/b]"
76561198041304371,954650,Druidstone: The Secret of the Menhir Forest,15.95,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy",10,"Fun ""little"" game with surprisingly complex battles. Highly recommended if you are fan of isometric RPGs and Turn based. | Отличная игра. Спокойная, красивая, без лишних сложностей...самое то, чтобы после работы перед сном поиграть пару часиков. | The game is honestly just...not that good? 
I'll preface this by saying I jumped right in at hard difficulty. It's not really challenging, just tedious. 
The story is...nonexistant. Your little mage tonberry ripoff does the ironic metahumor thing that ruins the entire experience. We get it, you're the developer's favorite character. but your ironic 4th wall quips are just not funny. 

They couldn't really figure out how to make levels more challenging so they just have infinitely spawning enemies. 
The game mechanics are questionable and not fully thought out. Here's some examples:

-Your melee guy doesn't get much in terms of armor, meanwhile you can level him up to give allies next to him +1 armor pretty early on. Effectively your support and mage become better at taking hits than the tank itself. For a good while. 
-You have an ability called Guard that will attack anyone getting in range, but this ability requires enemies to be next to the melee guy even if he equips a Halberd. that allows him to attack two squares away. Zero cohesion between skills in this card based system. 
-If you put bows on your support you're throttling yourself since bows have incredibly low damage. The default bow is better than the first bow upgrade because of the armor pen, and you won't see another ranged weapon for a while. Meanwhile every successful mission unlocks a bunch of useless melee weapons. Why would you make your support do damage? because most of her support abilities don't cost resources anyway. And she is far too squishy without the armor upgrade to be in melee. So effectively the game shoehorns how you play the support, and they deliberately make sure you do almost no damage with her if you play how they intend you to play.
-There's a reason why most games of this type are hex based. Square grid layout makes it annoying to spot when enemies are next to you on corners. Going from 6 to 9 possible squares of attacks, attacks of opportunity, on corners, is visually harder to spot and frankly looks janky and terrible
-Speaking of attacks of opportunity: I get that you guys copied the base mechanic from DnD, but you do realize monsters are supposed to only attack *once* per turn right? Watching my guy get clapped because he dared to move around the centipede twice in one turn was hilarious. Unless you have that special disengage skill, your characters become effectively rooted in place.  And because of the 9 possible squares of attacks, the skill is actually way less useful so you need a few of those just to get away from enemies. 

I'd say what the game *actually* is about is clever teleport swap tricks with the mage. Everything else just kinda feels like it enables that. And that by itself is not really fun.

EDIT:
After finishing the game, I'd also like to say it's too short. I have 60 hours played because I left it on overnight a few times. Overall about 35 hours worth of content, spanning across 35 missions, a few of which are straight up non-combat puzzles. You unlock a 4th character fairly late into the game to boot. It doesn't really feel like your characters actually full realize their roles until they'lre about level 6 or 7, at which point the game is kinda close to being done. There's no way to respec either, even after finishing the game. The final boss fight is also...incredibly unfun with the mechanics."

It's like a fast paced version of one of the mega man battle network games | A roguelike with a pretty unique (and fun) gameplay loop, and the difficulty’s scaled just right. Yeah, I think it’s definitely worth a try. | 想像以上にハイスピードで高難易度なゲームだったので最初は焦りました。
何度もやり直すことで敵の行動パターンが分かってきて、クリアが安定するようになると脳汁が出て楽しいゲームになります。
とにかくゲームのテンポが良くて、高難易度な点以外ではストレスが無く作られています。
キャラクターごとの能力の違いも大きいので、何度も繰り返し遊べてボリュームたっぷりです。
 | Still really bad at just thinking about positioning, been picking it up on and off, get overwhelmed at points, unlocking the music class was especially this. (Hours are inaccurate bc played a bunch on coast to coast flight and back. 

 I WANT to get better bc everything Feels so tight and interesting even in a saturated genre like deck-builders and rogue-likes.  If you feel like you might like the gameplay, give it a shot but be prepared for a bit of learning curve. Hope to see more of the dev's work and Steel Plus is a joy wherever their music is. (BUY RABBIT AND STEEL) | I feel beyond frustrated that there are a lot of mechanics that aren't clearly communicated. Why do bosses suddenly go from 200 HP to 2000? Shit like this should be clear as day and communicate what I could be doing that is wrong"

Custom animations for every character and everyone is so well characterised. Lots of fun easter eggs and despite being short by modern standards, I consider it worth the asking price and more.

It managed to make me audibly gasp despite my playtime including a 4 hour nap where I forgot to turn off the game.

An amazing game to spend one of my days off enjoying and vibing out with. | This game is silly and cute, fun to play through on a long weekend | In summary it's a story told through meeting a bunch of insane locals.

It's a short game. The gameplay is minigames; really stupid minigames, some of which are good and some awkward. It hangs together kind of weird. You have to play the game several times but NPCs have continuity between new games...

Aside from the weirdness it was funny I support the developers in their mad foray into point and click."

Или не слишком родное, это уже детали)) | Неплохая идея, но ужасная реализация. Геймплей состоит из сопоставления сопротивлений врагов с атаками своих мобов и наоборот. 
- скучные события, которых от силы штук 5;
- сломаные элитники, которые выкашивают всю твою пати без шансов из-за своих пасивок;

- ДЛС на каждого нового босса??? Игра и так не вывозит контентом, так еще и каждый босс с парой артефактов и мобов как отдельное длс продавать, просто смешно.

My Time At Sandrock is a sequel to My Time At Portia with better graphics, more balanced economy (Sadly Fishing is nerfed..), and more variety in the combat system with the addition of Firearms and a ton of unique weapons with their own movesets. However, the game is set in a DESERT. 

At first I honestly found the environment ugly and frankly preferred the more luscious greenery of Portia with the hills and rivers, but the developers managed to make a dying town in a barren Desert as INTERESTING as Portia's more cozy, peaceful experience. While Portia's builder takes over the workshop after his/her father retires, offering a wholesome experience with the player trying to rebuild their family's workshop back to it's former glory and getting to know the townies their father used to cherish, much like Stardew Valley, Sandrock does not follow the same premise, instead you're being employed by the town to replace a retiring builder and you find yourself in a town that you have no connection to whatsoever, even worse the town has No rivers, No Trees, and a ton of trash lying around. It is the builder's job to transform this dying old town into 


Just like Portia and Barnyard in the PS2, you feel good when you make upgrades and see your progress in buildings and structures around you. In Barnyard you upgrade the Barn and more and more NPCs use your upgrades and start hanging out and using the upgrades you made. Sandrock follows the same formula,
but SCALES it up with bigger structures bigger buildings and bigger upgrades that push the story forward in a way that gives you satisfaction not seen before in previous installments of the franchise. While Portia's community upgrades aim to better the quality of life, Sandrock gets deeper, the builder not only tries to better the quality of life by building upgrades but also solve problems left by previous generations.

In conclusion, Sandrock has been a great experience with surprising plot twists, funny dialogues and an amazing cast of characters that evolve and grow throughout the game. | 尽管我投入了超过560小时的游玩时间，并且购买了除《恋爱时光》以外的几乎所有DLC，但我不推荐这款游戏。这款游戏在模拟经营与角色扮演两方面均存在严重缺陷，对前作《波西亚时光》的忠实玩家更造成了情感伤害。

玩法方面：
几乎没有经营要素，只有枯燥的采集。
种田系统形同虚设。
游戏经济曲线极不平滑。
制作方在原材料、科技与剧情方面故意设置障碍，拖慢游戏进度。
可探索内容有限，且没有多周目目标或内容。
除了泳装包，其他DLC都缺乏购买价值。
服装包中加入大量丑陋的单片眼镜，折磨玩家的审美。
强制玩家体验同性恋爱内容，缺乏自主选择权。
尽管游戏已发行很长时间，但仍存在大量BUG与穿模。

艺术表现倒退：
与波西亚极富感染力的音乐相比，沙石镇的音乐显得平淡而乏味。
更写实的风格摧毁了波西亚的童话美学。
沙漠主题导致大部分场景色彩单调。

角色塑造崩塌：
NPC行为逻辑混乱，道德准则不一致。
人物性格设定矛盾。
前作角色遭不合理改写。
角色好感度系统沦为数值游戏。
关键抉择缺乏情感重量。

叙事结构缺陷：
主线完成度与城镇绿化进度强行绑定。
关键剧情转折缺乏情感铺垫。
结局仓促。
医疗奇迹剧情颠覆前作核心叙事。

总的来说，《沙石镇时光》暴露出制作方的商业考量压倒了创作初心，并以数值取代情感。


接下来的话多少带点情绪。


560个小时，足够横跨半个中国，从哈尔滨步行到南昌。我原以为能够找到类似波西亚的赛博家园，怎料得到的却是一场酣畅淋漓的吃翔之旅。

彭虎和小胖子晨练的温馨？不过是制作组拿来骗情怀的鱼饵！等玩家真上钩了，就会把角色变成推动狗血剧情的工具人。至于那位智障镇长，她能单枪匹马杀进沙漠深处，面对芝麻大的小事却一筹莫展？这种精神分裂的设定就像在玩家脑子里装了台混凝土搅拌机。

波西亚的居民们是会呼吸的，他们可爱、亲切，拥有独立的情感和内驱力，以及宝贵的品性。而沙石镇的居民呢？他们顶着精致的脸蛋，却如同提线木偶一样说着令人费解的话，就像橱窗里的芭比娃娃，等着玩家送礼物刷好感。玩家只身来到沙石镇，谁也不欠谁，却不得不在哄着这群巨婴居民的同时，为他们四处奔波、努力奋斗。
凭什么？

制作组把波西亚那个外表温婉、内心坚强的金吉尔，做成了沙石镇这个整容过度还略带婴儿肥的硅胶娃娃；把风度翩翩的盖斯特做成了沙石镇这个撒泼打滚的偏执狂。
昨天还是波西亚工坊主夫人的金吉尔，今天就对沙石镇工坊主芳心暗许？波西亚的老玩家熬过多少寒暑，只为了治愈金吉尔的顽疾。而沙石镇那个哑巴医生用一纸偏方就治好了？这哪里是打脸，分明是把老玩家的努力踩在脚底狠狠践踏！

我会为波西亚里那个每天清晨从我门前走过的农场女孩牵肠挂肚，她的淳朴与善良深深打动了我，她站在夕阳下金色麦田中的身影，早已被我珍藏于心。至于沙石镇，我宁愿选择与巫师3中威伦的刁民相处，也不愿意和沙石镇的机器人打交道。因为威伦的刁民虽然会礼貌地冲我吐口水，但当我回敬他们炸弹时，他们也会高兴得四处乱窜。

听说《永恒时光》的众筹大获成功，我呼吁制作组重拾《波西亚时光》的匠人精神：少一些对玩家的算计，多一些对故事的尊重。 | 继承了前作风格、有了更好的建模和更多剧情。部分剧情有点太幼稚了，看得我有点沉默，不知道是我太挑剔还是这个游戏目标群体是儿童。希望下一部剧情好一点吧，Q版建模还能卖卖萌混过去，如果正比人物建模还是这种剧情那真是比较恐怖了。

成就更容易达成了。比前作增加了派遣功能，这样一看感觉宠物还挺有用的，建议早点领养一只/几只。工作台不再要求手持物品制造建筑、提交任务订单时也不需要把物品放在背包，这两点好评。恋爱剧情不错，可以自由选择是否与角色开启好感关系好评。另外镇上除了主要人物之外还有其他无互动的npc，我喜欢这一点，说明镇上还是有些流动人口的。

米安这个角色很奇怪，从身份定位上她是主角同行，但在剧情中却显得比主角更受欢迎，反正我是感觉有点不舒服。比如过剧情的时候大家叫主角工坊主，叫米安叫名字（改成两位工坊主或者“你和米安”都要更好吧）。新建的学校牌子上只有米安名字，虽然剧情上是因为她出了建学校的钱，但咱也有这个钱啊，怎么不给主角冠名权。就算她给颜打了很多黑工按照订单量也不会比工坊主（主角）在这个镇上贡献更大吧，不能接受这个镇子上有一个更好的工坊主。从这一点上我很不推荐这个游戏，主角应该是行业内唯一的神（） | 这游戏越到后面 越食之无味弃之可惜  最逆天的还是 全属性点点满的成就（我已经放弃了，虽然还差几级）   肝的强度有点大  
前期的乐趣还是挺多的   
挖矿 探洞啊 剧情啊   谈朋友啊什么的   建自己喜欢的房子之类的 
还有自己捏了一个很满意的脸模  我还分享过  都是回忆   不知不觉500+小时了    
最后说一句  肝度有点大   甚玩 | Es ist besser als my Time at Portia, es hat eine viel bessere Grafik und ich habe es im Single, als auch Multiplayer gezockt und mir gefiel, beides.

Im Multiplayer baut man die Stadt auf, da gibt es kein einziges Gebäude und im Single Player steht schon alles und da hat man andere Aufträge.

Hier kann man angeln, sammeln, Sachen herstellen, Feldarbeit, Tierzucht und vor allem Heiraten"

Larian在此呈现的，远非寻常意义上的电子游戏。
作为游戏，各种设计完美衔接，恰到好处；自由度高到令人发指，你可以做你自己；装备/等级/数据都是精心设计，兼顾了最大公约数；
作为音乐，Down by the river随河风飘扬成流动的叙事，I Want to Live在抉择时刻撕开灵魂，The Power见证胜利后紧握棱镜的双手，各类主题曲契合场景主题，已然挣脱媒介的桎梏，变成可以交互的交响诗，让我事后还反复专门聆听感慨；
作为剧本，这内容本身就是很精彩的小说，作者们绝对有撰写一部畅销魔幻小说的深厚功力。正义/邪恶，生存/死亡，杀戮/放生等人性和生命的主题引人哲思；如果去电影院是用2.5h欣赏了一部有深度的电影，那么在BG3，你是用100h+去体验有无奈有选择有善恶的跌宕魔幻人生。
我把游戏结束后在营地跟大家聊天的最后存档命名“Do not want to say Farewell”，一路走来，跟这堆朋友和战友同甘共苦，真的希望能一起继续生活下去，最后营地跟大家聊天穷尽选项，试图寻找更多的互动，特别是跟影心的七八次拥抱还留有数据的余温，舍不得说再见。但是Larian残忍又仁慈地让每个同行者带着伤痕继续前行——有人背负星辰远征，有人归于市井炊烟。这何尝不是最温柔的现实主义：所有相遇终究要归还给时光。
至此，我的龙与地下城故事已封存在剑湾的晚风中，有生之年，我还会再体验阿斯代伦和其它角色的一生。或许这正是CRPG的伟大之处：它允许我们在现实生活的夹缝里，体验无数个未曾活过的自己。

虽然也能看到一些对BG3批评改进的意见，但是瑕不掩瑜，个人认为有些地方确实可以再改进以方便玩家，有些意见却是因人而异而不能算作缺点和批评。
当你花了10-15h去学习这个游戏的机制和基本原理后跨过门槛，你真的无法想象Larian是如何创作出这样一部伟大作品的。如果这部作品无法被超越，是因为她确实太精湛也值得珍惜。如果被超越，那么游戏史上又多了另一颗明珠，也是我们的另一份礼物。
谢谢你，Larian。

A Love Letter to the Ninth Art – A Middle-Aged Player's 100-Hour Journey Through Baldur's Gate 3

As someone nearing forty, with both elderly parents and young children to care for, finding large chunks of time to sit in front of a computer and savor a game is no easy feat. This Spring Festival, I made up my mind to finally taste this cup of coffee that had been brewing for years. With the understanding and support of my wife (for which I am deeply grateful), I managed to carve out a week to indulge in uninterrupted play. After 99 hours and 40 minutes, I completed the game. Sitting in front of the screen late at night, I was left in awe, unable to shake the profound impact it had on me. This journey will undoubtedly remain one of the most unforgettable experiences of my life, a radiant milestone in my personal gaming history.

What Larian has created here is far from an ordinary video game.

As a game, every design element is seamlessly integrated, perfectly balanced. The freedom it offers is almost overwhelming—you can truly be yourself. The equipment, levels, and stats are meticulously crafted, catering to a broad spectrum of players.

As music, Down by the River drifts with the breeze, becoming a flowing narrative. I Want to Live tears at your soul during moments of decision, and The Power resonates as you grasp the prism in victory. Each theme song fits its scene so perfectly that it transcends the medium, transforming into an interactive symphonic poem that I found myself revisiting and reflecting on long after the game had ended.

As a novel, the content itself is a masterful piece of fantasy literature. The writers clearly possess the skill to craft a best-selling fantasy novel. Themes of justice versus evil, life versus death, and killing versus sparing provoke deep philosophical reflection. If watching a movie in a theater is like spending 2.5 hours appreciating a thought-provoking film, then Baldur's Gate 3 is like spending over 100 hours living a tumultuous, magical life filled with difficult choices and moral dilemmas.

I named my final save file in the camp, where I chatted with everyone before the end, ""Do Not Want to Say Farewell."" After journeying together, sharing both hardships and triumphs with these friends and comrades, I truly wished we could continue living together. I exhausted every dialogue option in the camp, searching for more interactions, especially with Shadowheart, whose seven or eight hugs still lingered with the warmth of data. I couldn’t bear to say goodbye. Yet, Larian, in their cruel yet merciful way, allowed each companion to move forward with their scars—some destined to carry the stars on their shoulders, others to return to the mundane life of hearth and home. This, perhaps, is the most tender form of realism: all encounters must eventually be returned to the passage of time.

Thus, my Dungeons & Dragons tale has been sealed in the evening breeze of the Sword Coast. In this lifetime, I will return to experience the lives of Astarion and other characters. Perhaps this is the greatness of CRPGs: they allow us, in the crevices of our real lives, to live countless versions of ourselves we never had the chance to be.

While there are some criticisms and suggestions for improvement regarding BG3, they are minor blemishes on an otherwise flawless gem. Some aspects could indeed be tweaked for player convenience, while others are subjective preferences rather than flaws.

Once you’ve spent 10-15 hours learning the game’s mechanics and fundamental principles, crossing that threshold, you can’t help but marvel at how Larian managed to create such a masterpiece. If this work remains unrivaled, it’s because it is truly exquisite and deserves to be cherished. If it is ever surpassed, then another jewel will have been added to the annals of gaming history, another gift for us all.

Thank you, Larian. | This is probably going to be one of the best games for the next decade, the voice acting is sublime and the writers seemed to have made deals with the devil in order to make such a good tale. 10/10 | The replayability of this game is insane, Larian did an amazing job giving us exactly what we wanted and maybe even a little more. This game has taken over my life and I love it so much, lol, and showing no signs of putting it down any time soon! | I have played this game for 6 hours (2h on character creator), never played this type of game before.. can say I am impressed and enjoying it a lot.

18 hours in the game: I think that I'm addicted. The stories are surprising and wholesome. I feel like a hero in this game, living for the good of the people.

50 hours: I finally finished act 1. And oh boy did I turn from good to evil with every step I took. I didn't mean to be... How was I supposed to know that pulling the wrong lever, I'll be catapulting a gnome to space. That wasn't my fault.

80 hours: Yes! Give me your gold. All the shiny trinkets you have. Give me your soul and all the power you hold. Give me more... MORE!

100 hours: How dare you look down on me, thinking like you could ever defeat me?! Hit me with all you got, it will never be enough!

120 hours: ... *only screams echo in the darkness* ...

130 hours: *Muahahaha-*

but your agenda is also driven by greed.

76561198041304371,1102190,Monster Train,16.833333333333332,Strategy,18,"Monster Train is a deck-building game. It's following in the footsteps of other great games like Slay the Spire. As a result, I will be comparing this game to Slay the Spire a lot.

In Monster Train, you defend a train full of (you guessed it) monsters. You fight a series of battles, with each battle involving a bunch of minor enemies followed by a major (boss) enemy. In-between battles you do some deck construction using various stations. One run takes about 60 to 90 minutes.

I've gotten 85 hours of fun out of this game.

THE GOOD:
- Monster Train is a really fun card battler.
- The train level mechanic, where you have 4 different levels in your train, adds a lot of strategic depth and novelty.
- You can always refuse a new card or artifact, something I always wished I could do in Slay the Spire—which would force me to take cards I didn't want and then make it really hard to get rid of them.
- It's also easier to remove cards you don't want, often allowing you to craft the deck you want by the endgame.
- The game lets you know who the major bosses are at the very start of the run. This allows you to build your deck accordingly.
- Great variety of enemies, cards, and special abilities.
- Great learning curve, as new concepts are gradually introduced so you don't have to drink from a firehose of knowledge.
- Nice graphics and music.

THE BAD:
- There is no real story to the game. There's kind of the veneer of a story, but it doesn't really explain why you need to do multiple runs.
- Even with the better control over your deck than other games in the genre, you are still at the mercy of the random number generator. It can be frustrating to lose because you never found the cards you needed, or because of a terrible draw for an otherwise great deck.
- The game developers claim this game is a roguelike, but it's not really. You play to unlock new features, which is a good tutorial mechanic, but to be a roguelike the game should require you to learn by failing. I won on my second attempt.

THE UGLY:
- In this game the protagonists are the demons of Hell, and you actually fight against Heavenly angels. This doesn't bother me, but you might find it offensive.
- When using a mouse and dragging a card to play it, if you linger the game can automatically scroll up to a level above. This is a great way to ruin your battle by playing the card on the wrong level!
- The game enables you to ramp up the difficulty with a feature called the Covenant. This is ostensibly a good thing that gives the game some extra life and challenge. Unfortunately, in trying to find a variety of ways to increase the difficulty the game designer has mainly made the game more annoying. They add lots of junk cards to your deck and make it harder to remove those cards. Hence, rather than ending with a bang, the game kind of fizzled out with a whimper as I got increasingly frustrated and quit.
 | I'll be honest. I didn't like it that much. Primarily because the game at higher difficults devolves into gigagbuffing one monster to solo the final boss. Still though learning the game was great. | I played this roguelite cards battler on various platforms, gamepass pc ,xbox and steam, and its a great game. Fun. 
For me the progression of the game is really good, while you play more you unlock fun other stuff. The combinations are a blast, you can make over the top OP cards. I like the sounds when the train is totaly full and your cards all packed with buffs, the sound is not beautiful, but catching, and I like the raw sound of the abilities clashing into each other.
Its cool and easy to play some rounds, make comobs and have fun.
Game is fun and well made, for sure worth your time

 | I stand by my early impressions that the UI clashes terribly in this game. For context, I've played and love Slay the Spire, and I THOUGHT I'd like Monster Train, but I thought it was kind of ugly...I admit I wasn't in the mood to give it a fair shake, and it is now starting to click with me. It's good, but not great, with tremendous replay value. | High Quality Time Deleting Machine. I have hundreds of hours on mobile as well. Base game is good but I recommend getting Wurmkin DLC as well. Unfortunately, not nearly enough Steam Community additions and sorely needs additional characters, cards, and artifacts."

Some of the achievements are just annoying and punishing (yes, there is no manual save so if you missed one, you're going to have to do the entire story from the beginning)

I wouldn't pay 22 maple bucks for it, but I got it on sale at a steep discount, so I'm satisfied. | I bought this game at 90% discount, and I think it is worth the price.

I do like the art style, though.

I completed my first run at a slow pace of 2.5 hours, with frequent backtracking and spam clicking when I didn't understand a puzzle (happened frequently - thank goodness for walkthroughs). There are four achievements that pad playtime - doing an activity for 2 min, staying in a room for 30 min, completing the game twice, and spending 5 hours in the game - so I wouldn't really count that as new content.

Overall, I think the art direction is well-done, but I had difficulty traversing the rooms and the music is pretty bare-bones spooky ambiance. I was interested in where the story was going before it abruptly ended in the final chapter; overall, it was too subtle for me to grasp, so I do feel like now I need to find an essay writeup explaining the plot. | I bought this game a long time ago and played it once, and forgot how was the game. After replaying it now i can remember why it was forgotten

The good:
- Nice art style, it has an aesthetic appeal to it, like playing in a miniature/ dollhouse setting, and you can toggle between different parts of the scene which is fun.
- Point and click with no time limits/ time challenges
- No deaths/ game over
- There is a link in the game which leads you to a walkthrough, but kind of tedious to switch tabs

The not so good:
- Some of the puzzles are kind of obscure to solve, and you wouldn't figure out that an item was supposed to go somewhere without trial and error at some point (or with a walkthrough) [spoiler]the flying tube puzzle is the one that is the most annoying of all, and not to mention repetitive, and WOW a flying tube can knock off a rock statue's head and still remain intact, WHY didn't i think of that solution?[/spoiler]
- The scenes are very small, and there are no options to highlight which areas can be interacted with, as well as no option to zoom in/ out, [spoiler]one part which makes me angry is the one that we have to find a digging/ hiding spot for a bone, there is a  crudely drawn map which shows us the location but the hiding area is SO SMALL in the scene and is actually hidden in a corner of the house, disguised as a small black lump which could have been part of the background since the house is so broken, and this is just ONE example, there are few other scenes which equally frustrates me[/spoiler]
- Story is short but provides no real explanations, just snippets of what happened and no real narrative from the characters involved, so we have to make guesses most of the time, and the ending is so obscure that it makes me question what was the story from the beginning, like we don't know what really happened to the main character. Plus, we don't really know what most of the characters in the story were thinking about or what is their actual personality; there are letters and notes throughout the game but they were just scribbles of incomprehensible words which is a shame, because maybe if there were letters to read or some notes written in the drawings etc, then maybe we would have some idea of how the character is like or what actually happened, and that would have add more depth to the game i think [spoiler]the scene where there is a police car in the tree is the one that baffles me, like what is the relationship of this scene to the whole story? i can assume someone died? maybe? but who? everyone in the scene died? why and how did it happened?? or maybe nobody died and the scene was just a product of main character's imagination??? and what's up with the tree roots and the tree house? the roots could represent the root of the family problems but what about the tree house?? IDK so many questions....[/spoiler]
- Music is meh, like most of the time it's just quiet silence, and only certain parts of the game have some real music
- You can't jump to a particular scene by looking at the map, instead you have to click allllllllll the way to the scene that you want to go, very fun

喜欢这类谜解密游戏，但对这款的感觉只有：好难玩啊。 能评价为去年玩过最后悔的游戏

This game gets significantly more fun the more you view it as a puzzle game rather than a city planning game. You are not trying to build a nice place to live. Instead, you are trying to funnel the right cars to the right places in whatever way works best. This leads you into some city designs which would make absolutely no sense in a normal city builder, but looking at it as a puzzle game, this is not a problem whatsoever. To be clear: there is no goal in the game other than to make roads for the cars to reach the right color of business. The cars will always go the fastest route, and always deploy from the nearest available house, so you don't need to do any management at all other than setting up the roads and trying to plan it so that there isn't gridlock. This simple task never gets boring for long because the demand for cars will ramp up to inifinity until you lose. You can play ""endless"" mode once you lose, but trying to get the most trips completed before that point is the real draw, like trying to get the highest score or level in Tetris. | Schönes Spiel zum entspannen, ich mag die Grafik sehr.  Viele Maps und Möglichkeiten, wird nicht so schnell langweilig. Kann ich nur weiterempfehlen :) | Игра, в которой получаешь кайф просто от наблюдения за машинками. А потом ты думаешь, а почему бы не попробовать выбить все достижения и..... Ну в целом это реально, я почти все выбил, осталось всякие еженедельные и ежедневные активности закрыть и достижения по числу использований определенных улучшений, но мне стало впадлу это делать. В остальном игра топ, баланс конечно иногда может кинуть подлянку, когда появляются не те цвета где ты их ждешь или неожиданно квадрат в круг превращается. Но в классическом режиме можно все удалять и менять, там проблем особо нет(только ЕБАНН**ЫЙ МУМБАЙ, я на нем для 2000 поездок перепроходил раза 4, причем каждый раз результат был все ближе и ближе к желаемому результату, перед успехом получилось на 1996 закрыть, чуть не сгорел). Могу дать совет трофихантерам - на некоторых картах 2000 проще выбить через челенджи чем через классику. Полезность улучшений зависит от карты, иногда лучше взять светофор или круг, нежели шоссе или мост. Но это вы уже на своем опыте сможете узнать. 
В общем игра топ, и для отдыха подойдет и подумать и погореть, выбивая ачивки, можно. Я очень доволен покупкой, мне больше понравилась эта игра, чем про метро, она более честная в плане сложности. | ---{ Graphics }---

76561198041304371,1139980,Travellers Rest,1.5,"Adventure, Casual, Indie, RPG, Simulation, Early Access",0,"This game entered early access in 2020, and to this day the experience still feels thread-bare. Every corner you turn there's something that looks like it might lead to a quest, a new zone, or something you could unlock, but you just can't. The game has a lot of issues besides content that you might usually be inclined to hand-wave as typical early-access issues, like a poorly tuned resource economy, and an ineffectual skill-point system, but when it's been in early access for nearly five years, it's starting to run out of excuses. 

The game looks amazing, and has some incredibly detailed environments, solid sound effects and music, and I'd happily change my review if the game was ever actually released, as I do think the potential is there. But realistically, this does unfortunately look like a game doomed to languish in an incomplete state in early access forever. | Traveler's Rest is indeed a cozy and relaxing game with its charming pixel art and tavern management gameplay. It's the perfect mix of crafting, building, and interacting with customers, creating a very laid-back experience.

The idea of multiplayer beyond split-screen would be definitely enhance the game! Being able to collaborate online with friends, managing a tavern together, or even visiting each other's taverns could make it even more enjoyable. Hopefully, the developer consider expanding the multiplayer feature in the future. | Constant updates? Check. Fun game play? Check. Fun grind? Check. it seems every time I play it I have more fun then the last run through. Absolutely recommend and still one of my favorite games. 10/10! | 5+ years in early access. $6+Million in revenue. Only one update every 6-7 months that still takes at least 4 patches afterwards to make it playable. 

On top of that, they keep doing these annual ""Halloween"" and ""Christmas"" updates that do not impact the actual permanent story or playability of the game. They only add temporary items and recipes. Instead of working on big long-term updates, we get these mini seasonal updates that don't impact the progress the of actual game. 

The new ""multiplayer"" update is a complete joke considering 2/3 of the game still isnt even completed and there's nothing to do after 2 hours. 

Total playtime before reaching end of the current story: about 5-6 hours. 

Release a full game before doing all the extra gimmicks. | It has a large amount of problems which may be forgivable if it was fun, but it is not. 

The game moves at an absolute snails pace, providing you very little direction and making everything feel ultimately pretty pointless. The control scheme is pretty clunky aside from the standard WASD, and every action feels like it is delayed, to the extent that at times i doubled my actions because I pressed the key again thinking it hadn't registered. 

Items lack proper descriptions to be useful in any kind of way and crafting things is an absolute labor with no real purpose other then to artificially make the experience longer. Thus having to craft things to see what they do is a complete kick in the ding ding should it not work out the way you intended. 

I spent four hours in this game, Nothing changed. I leveled up, I made the same dishes or slightly different ones that really changed nothing. I made the same drinks. The customer approval system is lazy and uninspired. Especially the angry customer mechanic. You see, customers get angry but they do so at complete random. There's no way to prevent this so you have to try and appease them by speaking with them and if that doesn't work you hit them with a broom. Why are my customers getting angry when all their needs have been met in a timely fashion? It's so they could include this stupid broom mechanic that's why. 

The formula to make this game enjoyable was really quite simple and they botched it at every turn. Very weak story, Very weak gameplay and waste of your time and money."

The White Door es una aventura Point & Click que tiene lugar en el universo de Rusty Lake, pero nos ofrece una experiencia algo diferente al resto de títulos de la saga, siendo considerado un spin-off. El protagonista es Robert Hill, el exnovio de la conocida Laura Vanderboom. Robert despierta en la habitación de un manicomio (instituto de salud mental, “The White Door”), en 1972. Sintiéndose algo confuso y desorientado, deberá seguir un listado de tareas que conforman su rutina diaria. Cada noche, al irnos a dormir, iremos reviviendo una serie de sueños que irán desvelando nuestro pasado, la relación con Laura y los motivos que nos han llevado a nuestra actual situación. Nuestro objetivo será ayudar a Robert a recuperar sus recuerdos.

[h2]Jugabilidad / Apartado técnico[/h2]
The White Door rompe con la jugabilidad convencional del resto de juegos de Rusty Lake. La historia principal se desarrolla en la habitación del manicomio en el que nos encontramos. En el lado izquierdo de la pantalla podremos mover a Robert por toda la sala, realizando las diferentes tareas asignadas. En el lado derecho veremos los detalles de los documentos, puzzles o juegos a los que tendremos que hacer frente. La mayoría de tareas serán bastante sencillas, sin muchas complicaciones, pero también dispondremos de varios rompecabezas de distinta dificultad y variadas mecánicas. Cada noche podremos revivir un sueño, momento en el que se irá revelando la parte crucial de la trama a través de distintos recuerdos y conversaciones. 

[h2]Valoración[/h2]
The White Door es un spin-off de la saga Rusty Lake, con una jugabilidad bastante diferente, pero que mantiene la esencia, el misterio y la abundancia de secretos, igual que los originales. Es probable que los veteranos de la saga sientan este juego mucho más sencillo y conciso, no les falta razón, pero igualmente me ha parecido un título muy entretenido de jugar, que aporta algo nuevo y diferente. El juego contiene muchos secretos y guiños escondidos, paralelos a la historia original y resulta accesible para cualquier persona. Un dato curioso es que el juego fue lanzado junto a una [url= https://mentalhealthandfishing.com/]página web[/url], donde jugadores de todo el mundo pudieron hacer un seguimiento de distintas pistas para descubrir una serie de cubos negros escondidos, necesarios para encontrar un secreto oculto en el juego. Completar la historia al 100% puede llevar en torno a 2-3 horas.
Lo salvaría de un incendio! 👨‍🚒👍🔥

[quote]🚨 Si te ha gustado la reseña y quieres más, sigue al Mentor: [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45092978/] Indies ON FIRE [/url]🚨[/quote] | Un jeu simple et avec pleins d'énigmes. Je ne m'attendais pas à tout ça mais je trouve que son état mental est très bien représenté à travers le jeu ! | The gameplay is a bit different from the others in the series, it's something I welcome with open arms, however I think due to the nature of this change the gameplay has become a lot easier than the other entries in the series, though I don't really mind that and don't think it's something that ruins the game at all. That aside, the best thing about this game is it's story, it's mostly to build up lore on characters and places that exist within the rusty lake series. another thing differently this game does is how it approaches horror. it doesn't make me feel as uneasy as the other games did, but I believe that's because it's focus is more on the lore and psychological aspects. it's something you won't really experience if you haven't played the other games before this. The story of this game assumes you already played the other games, there's just to many things I don't think someone would really ""respect"" as much if they started on this game first. the only other thing I can think of to bring up is the art style, which I probably enjoy the most out of the series (Roots and Paradox might be tied for that though) it's very ""adorable"" I'd say.

(Small thing to note I did enjoy the voice acting but I do believe it did need to be mixed just a bit better, some parts you could hear how close they were to the microphone etc., It's not really a deal breaker as the games great regardless, just something a lil nit picky.) | Игра представляет собой графическую игру и головоломку, где мы играем за больного амнезией Роберта Хилла.

Just can't anymore.
When Bungie actually puts in effort into their game (Aka, major DLC's minus lightfall) the game is amazing, but the amount of times they have dropped the ball, especially with this last episode/season has finally done it for me. I've followed Destiny since the original on the xbox 360, became a fan of the story, and continued on into Destiny 2 back when they were still part of activision on battlenet. I've always attempted to keep good faith and put in a good word even when the game was at a low point, but now after having the saint-14 and osiris gay love story interjected and shoved down my throat multiple times, the last season ""echos"" big bad guy get one shot in a cutscene and escape by floating down a vex ""milk"" river, and now the current episode which started by reusing a game mode that they butchered and made worse than the original which was still in the game and the other gamemode that came later which was decent but had loot that you could get just by running around in the standard maps made it not at all worth doing. Compound that with the tonic system that relied on Strict RNG to get new tonics which were necessary to get further in the reputation system and played a minimal part in the over arching story and took forever just to get three tonics out of DOZENS WHICH BARELY WORKED AND WAS ON A TIMER THAT YOU HAD TO MICRO MANAGE ON TOP OF OTHER MICRO MANAGING SYSTEMS.... yeah it was just TOO MUCH.  The final nail in the coffin was the fact that we found out just how much work they put into the seasonal / episodic content which normally is spread out when they gave it all at one time. By the way you could do all 3 parts of revenant in less than 3 hours which for something that you pay for is absolutely Pathetic. For comparison Warframe Is completely 100% FREE and has proven to have a better player experience, impactful story, developers that actually care, better visuals, smaller file size, did not take paid content away forever (yes that happened in destiny), and more. 

I loved this game because it's story at one point was amazing and now... it's a chore.  Combine all that with the current state of the company's choices and behaviors, it's just not worth trying to keep the rose tinted glasses on and support it anymore.  I loved this game.... and I just feel betrayed and disappointed.  Call me a Schill, say I'm coping, or a hater I no longer care. Like many said Destiny was the only thing that could Kill Destiny, and well they did it.  I'm done supporting Bungie until they get their collective heads out of their ass.

Edit as to Toasty's comments, I don't care if Osiris and Saint are gay, I care that the fact that they are gay is more of a Slap to the face and is way too frequent as a main story beat, it's not subtle like other characters and kept in the background as an aspect of the character which would have made the first Episode much more impactful story wise. As Toasty mentioned Warframe has these notions and explores it but it's subtle and not in  your face and distracting from the overall story which is why I exemplify it's story over This one. Take that as you will but I stand with my choice and opinion, don't be assholes just because you disagree and have a different opinion.

For those who didn't fixate on being jerks trying to demonize another person,

Thank you.

For the rest of you pathetic losers who chose to HATE me because of your own personal LGBTQ AGENDAS over know that this review and opinion will never come down of my own volition but comments for this review will now be locked for YOUR HATRED towards me.

Pete Parsons is directly responsible for cutting hundreds of devs and bringing this ship crashing into the ground. Destiny is genuinely unenjoyable and within the hour i was bored. this is genuinely depressing as i have thousands of hours, and thousands on psn and have loved the game through some of its lowest points. but the mediocrity of this season is killing me. i genuinely am worried this game will actually die for real within this act. | I think this is the best game ever made and it's not very close. I started playing around the time it went free to play and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. No other game does what this one does. I think everyone should get to experience what Destiny offers. This rating is positive because of what this game has meant to me, not because of what it has become.

	[*]This game is so unfairly priced that I can't genuinely recommend any of my non-Destiny friends or new players to pick it up to try it out.
	[*]The community is toxic as hell.
	[*]The game is dying, fewer and fewer people get on to play every single day.
	[*]There are cheaters in 1/3 of Crucible games (might just be caused by the dwindling player count making the concentration of cheaters higher).
	[*]Every new update is bugged (sometimes to the point of unplayability) and results in either server downtime, another update to address it (takes a month for this to get released), or Bungie just giving up and auto-completing quest steps.
	[*]The new player onboarding experience is abysmal. You're given a 5 minute cutscene to explain the story (since they completely removed the real campaign), a couple of introductory quests, and then you're kicked out of the bird's nest to do whatever your heart desires with minimal direction or suggestion on where to go. So bad, in fact, that Bungie has given up and now provides players with an option to skip it entirely since they know that if a new player is playing this game, it MUST be at the direction of another existing player telling them what to do anyway.
	[*]The game is riddled with power creep. Guardian kits are the strongest they have ever been and new aspirational content has gotten easier and easier.
[/list]

Realistically, the game needs a reset like Destiny 1 got with the release of Destiny 2, but Bungie's insistence on this being a forever game post-Final Shape has led to Destiny 3 being nothing but a pipe dream while this game wanes in its final days after the equivalent of an Avenger: Endgame story beat. Bungie just doesn't know when to let it go.

Some of my best memories are playing this game, but I just can't in good conscience say that you should start playing this game if you haven't already. You just had to be there, I guess."

The gun play is one of the best in any game I have ever played and the charachters are very fun. However I can’t recommend the game strictly on the monetization. For example before this new season (24) there were leaked mini battle passes for all of the new legends that would add a ton of progression that was desperately needed. It would have given the players something worth playing for. But what does EA do? Make you pay 10$ for each one. This isn’t even mentioning the collection events that cost 300+ dollars to complete. They also just added a new mobile game pay system that makes you pay to unlock something cheap and then to unlock something free. All the skins are also egregiously overpriced in general. It’s all there to just make you spend as much money as possible it’s trash. They don’t really care about the players they care about the money that’s it. The balance changes are often mediocre and  don’t always fix all the problems they should. EA is lucky the foundation of this game is as good as it is otherwise people wouldn’t put up with the gross monetization. If your a new player that know you won’t buy anything then maybe give it a try. Otherwise steer clear it’s not worth your time until EA gets it together and starts to care more about the player base.(which will never happen) | >Plays Apex

76561198041304371,1172620,Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,5.616666666666666,"Action, Adventure",17,"This game was great, but instead of fighting other pirates you now fight:
- Bugs, bugs and more bugs and every update even more bugs created / brought back
- Cheaters, a lot of them (rare lets you do all the work videoreporting them and still do barely anything)
- Desync, hitreg / actionreg, rubber-banding, disconnects, stutter, overall lag, miserable latency, underdeveloped MS Server. 
All of this is getting worse and worse with every update, despite the devs promises for years now.

From a devs perspective: They dug their own graves when they didn't see what a great debug opportunity Arena could have been and instead did everything backwards. 
A minimal game mode with no active events or pve code would be a great debugging platform for underlying problems. This would have also given the possibility of testing updates with more or less a 15-29 mins timeframe for: max lost time for players, time to next possible update without interrupting games and reverting back at any time in case of failure.

But what do I know, I'm just a programmer who likes to game.

-> Can't recommend until major improvements, will update review if/when that happens. <- | Отличная игра, раньше играл через game pass, потом купил в стиме и удалил через какое-то время, спустя полтора-два года захотел поиграть снова и через десяток часов вспомнил, почему перестал играть. ЧИТЕРЫ, которых невозможно зарепортить буквально через каждый один мир (стреляют ВООБЩЕ без промаха и сквозь текстуры), время идет, а их количество как будто не уменьшается, руки просто опускаются играть, по сравнению даже в Call of Duty намного меньше читаков. Попробую еще несколько раз и если ничего не поменяется, отзыв еще дополню. | The game itself is fantastic—the ship and wind mechanics, PvP battles, and especially the stunning wave animations make for an incredible experience. But in its current state, I cannot recommend it. The game is plagued with exploits and, worst of all—cheaters.

[h2]But hey, you can just report them, right? Sure! You just need to follow these SIMPLE steps:[/h2]

[list]
[*]Pre-record all your gameplay or use an instant replay feature (Don't have a high-end PC? Too bad!)
[*]Manually gather evidence and put together a solid report.
[*]Submit the report through a long, outdated browser-based process with strict criteria (such as capturing the cheater's nametag—which is much harder than it sounds).
[*]Deal with ridiculous limitations—only five evidence files per report, each under 50MB. If your files are too big, you’ll need to upload them elsewhere.
[/list]

Easy peasy, right? And even if you do all that and receive confirmation that the cheater was banned, it's just a minor inconvenience for them. Why? Because of ban evasion. Without going into too much detail, they can simply create a new account in under five minutes—without even repurchasing the game.

[h2]But I still like the game. Can I give feedback, suggest solutions, or discuss the cheater problem with the community?[/h2]

Whoa, whoa! Easy there, champ. Turns out, that’s not allowed either. Apparently, players are only supposed to report cheaters and trust that the devs are “working on it.” But hey, give them time—it’s not like this game has been out for over five years, right? 😃

Here’s part of a response from a staff member on the official Sea of Thieves forums:

""[...] Dropping anchor here as while we know this comes from a good place and of wanting to make the game better, and we do as well, the forums is not the space to discuss solutions when it comes to these things. This is because only the internal team know of what is and isn't possible and it is not something that is easily solved or has a quick solution. [...]""

[h2]To summarize:[/h2]

Reporting a single cheater takes far too much time. And if we consider the time a player loses at the hands of a cheater, let’s not forget:

[list]
[*]You could lose a boat full of treasure (representing two or more hours of gameplay).
[*]You could lose an Hourglass streak that took several hours to build.
[*]And now, on top of that, you’re expected to waste more of your time filing a detailed report—a job that shouldn’t be yours in the first place.
[/list]

[h2]To be fair...[/h2]

They do fix exploits—eventually.
But if you don’t mind a game infested with cheaters, go ahead—it’s a great game.
And always remember: they're working on it. 😉 | Fun in teams, scary alone!

Overall this pack is really good, I'd say it's worth | Oh hey, my profile picture is one of the devils from The Devils and the Details. Either way...

Tl;dr of my mini-reviews of each game: This pack is still very solid, even though with some games there are small ""ughs"".

---------------

Quiplash 3: Aesthetically one of the more unique ones of the Jackbox series, featuring claymation-style elements. Quiplash is Quiplash, you fill in the blanks of sentences and make a ha-ha. The only caveat I have with this version is the music - in the soundtrack it's fine, but during gameplay, it's intimidating even... but it's easily brushed off.

The Devils and the Details: Hhhhhhhh - mixed feelings. It's a group game where some tasks are independent, some require teamwork. You fill a bar with the tasks you do and move to the next day. Here, it really depends on the group of people you are playing with - playing with people other than those that you have vocal contact with is borderline impossible, just because of the teamwork-required tasks. Even then, this is something I occasionally play with a group of people and get joy out of it. Occasionally = far less than the other games, but still played.

Champ'd Up: To this day, still probably the best drawing game in Jackbox Packs. You draw characters based on a prompt, and then get a rival whose appearance you see, but don't know the prompt. Then they fight each other. It's so simple in concept, but really fun. Also, bonus points to the music - Andy Poland went hard and I appreciate it, really digging the electronic music mixed with march band drums. Kinda reminds me of Death Grips' earlier works through that.

Talking Points: Vocal improvisation, the game - speaking is mandatory in this game, and so, should be played with those with vocal contact. You get a topic for a slideshow, but don't know the pictures that a different player chooses for you. This game usually gets extremely restless and out-of-bounds, which can be really fun at times. Freeplay-mode for this is an odd choice.

Blather 'Round: This game is one of my go-to games when introducing Jackbox to other players (others being Tee K.O. and Guesspionage). You get a thing that you have to explain about with using cryptic words, and give ""praise/discipline"" to player-given answers (in other words, you can agree, or don't agree with a word to lead others onward). Fun and engaging, best with a big player group. This game should've gotten the Freeplay-mode, but I guess such wasn't picked up for the potential difficulty of giving custom words the prompts that the game gives you?"

Having seasonal mechanics tacked on seems like the easy approach but doesn't add much to the overall game. They really should take the Dead Cells model with the stage scheming and add more branching zones and tilesets to make things feel fresh. Add more variety to the rooms per stage, like with the recent anxi desert change. Stick to one overarching mechanic that players can keep grinding on instead of adding seasonal ones that shift character useability and run approach every 4 months.

Subsequent updates also seem to be introducing some lag to the game. Tabbing out, even in singleplayer makes the game hang for a split second. Entering one room in multiplayer after someone else causes the game to hang at times. If the devs really do want to stick to the seasonal plan, then expand the skins to include the characters as well and make them limited to events! Soul essence is already a persistent currency that players can acquire with a grind. | I've sunk a few hundred hours into this game; once you grasp the connections between guns, abilities, and scrolls, it becomes  seriously addicting. I've played every season variation, and the way star link expands upon your character build is the most fun yet. I can easily justify $20 due to the amount of content it offers. | There's only two solid FPS Roguelites at this point... and this is one of them. (Other is roboqquest).

Build diversity is good, weapons are fun to use. Its just to have something you can quickly pick up and start shooting, nothing much to really think about. | I didn't give this game much thought until I started playing it. The game is a well-made rogue-lite that's fun to play. The experience is even better with friends, up to three people, or you can find online matches.
I've highlighted 3 points that I think are important to mention:

Seasons
The season system is well-made. I've only played the last 2 seasons. At first, it's hard to understand the mechanics, but you get the hang of it over time. You just have to pay close attention to the readings, but they're very fun and varied. The season pass is free, easy and quick to get, and gives you beautiful and well-made cosmetics, which is a very positive point.

Replayability
I particularly enjoyed replaying the game. Putting on a playlist to listen to while playing is a pleasant experience. The game has many achievements and some of them require time and effort to complete, a huge variety of weapons to unlock, which gives a great feeling when you get a new weapon, in days when in any game you have to keep paying to get new things in the game (the game has 3 DLC with weapons, but the game also adds free weapons in each season).

Game modes
The game has few modes, only three, being the conventional mode, the main game mode where you have the stages and their difficulty to choose and challenge yourself and it is in this mode that you unlock most of the weapons and achievements in the game. The daily challenge mode, nothing special, the name already says what it is, a mode with a modifier that changes daily, just to get some achievements and challenge yourself. And the last mode, the horde mode, is a mode where you can equip some improvements to your characters and fight against large hordes of enemies that get harder and harder over time, but it has a final boss, so the hordes end. It's fun, but it only has two maps so far, and it ends up being repetitive.

My final thoughts are that the game is worth it for those who like games of this style, it's very different and diverse from the others. For the base game I think the price is worth it, but for the DLC I think it's worth waiting for a sale.

Enjoy and feedback! :) | Eu queria muito dar uma tryhardada em Gunfire Reborn, mas estava meio complicado de jogar sozinho. Então, surgiu uma promoção de conteudo adicional do game e resolvi comprar uma das 3 DLC's do jogo.
E rapaziada... de longe foi a melhor coisa que eu ja fiz!!! ^^ 

Gunfire Reborn é um game Roguelike/Roguelite, FPS, com leves elementos de RPG. Existem 12 personagens jogavéis que são bicinhos bem fofinhos (não sei se chega a ser furry), em que todos possuem 2 habilidades unicas e especiais, dando uma pegada de que cada run seja realmente diferenciada e unica. 6 são free, onde você desbloqueia apenas jogando, e os outros 6 são de dlc's. 

O jogo possui bastante coisa legal, como uma variedade boa de armas, inimigos, pergaminhos para buildar e uma arvore de talentos bacana até.
Durante a play, você vai se deparar com 3 steps até o final. É como se fosse o começo, meio e fim, bem padrão!! E em cada stage diferente, existe a possibilidade de vir 2 tipos de chefes. É sempre sortido, nunca da pra saber ao certo quem vai vir. 

Agora, como eu disse la em cima, no começo era realmente f0da de jogar sozinho. Eu até tive a cara de pau de sair chamando usuarios aqui da Steam pra jogar junto a mim, mas foi tudo em vão, infelizmente kkkkkkkk. Masssss, acabei descobrindo que da pra colocar bots [IA] pra ajudar e facilitar a gameplay!!! E isso foi extremamente util. *-* 
Eles até atacam, mas no geral são bem ignorantes KKKKKKKKKK, o que de fato eles são bons é em te levantar quando você é derrubado por algum monstro, assim evitando que sua jornada seja finalizada precocemente!!!!! 

Os graficos até que são decentes. Os mapas e cenarios são bem variados! Alguns são curtos e outros extensos. A arte do jogo é legal e a trilha sonora é meio chatinha mas da pra se acostumar.
Uma coisa que eu não curti muito foi que pra jogar no controle é meio ruimzinho. Eu sugiro muito que se você puder, jogue com um mouse & teclado. No joystick da pra brinca de boa, mas vai por mim e confia no que eu to falando!!!!!!!!!! Outro ponto também é a fisica e movimentação dos bonecos. É tudo muito duro, meio travado! Parece que os bichos tão com 500kg de concreto nas roupas huehuehuehuehue. 
Mas enfim... creio eu que isso seja proposital do jogo mesmo. Até porque tem itens que te dão um pouqinho a mais de velocidade. 

E pra encerrar, se você quer muito jogar sofrendo o minimo possivel eu recomendo duas coisas: a primeira é que jogue com amigos e conhecidos!!!! Vai ser bemmmmmmm mais ""suave"" a caminhada de todos até ficarem full broken. E a segunda é, caso for jogatinar sozinho, compre a DLC chamada Artisan and Magician. Vai por mim, de longe este conteudo adicional é DISPARADO o melhor de todos. Ela possui uma personagem bem OP que vai melhorar bastante o seu early game. 

E é isso aew galera. Sem sombra de duvidas recomendo simmmmmmmmmm Gunfire Reborn a todo mundo!!!!!!!!!!! Muito obrigado a você que chegou até aqui, um forte abraço e nos vemos nas proximas analises. Até la, bjbjbjbj e fuyyyyyyyyyyyy :* õ/

The art is beautiful, the enemies are varied and interesting. The emergent narrative and the overarching goal of the game makes me come back to it again and again.

Some inexperience shows here and there, with cards ""borrowed"" from StS, but the game has SO MUCH besides it, to the point where I see these cards as an homage, rather than plagiarism. 

If you like deck building, I can't recommend this game enough | If you're a fan of Slay the Spire / Monster Train, or any other variation of those types of games, this game is similar enough to where you might get some enjoyment out of it. Off the rip, the game is extremely fun (at first) as you're exploring different areas and learning the mechanics of the game but the more you play the game you realize it's less of a roguelike and more of a linear progression (meta) type game. 

In games like this you'd want to explore different deck synergies, go to different parts of the map, etc to find new ways of winning but at the end of the day there are mechanics in this game that pigeon hold you if you want to beat the final boss. For example, on the run that I'm on with one of the three main characters, I have to defeat this NPC towards the final part of the run FOUR times before he'll reveal to me how I can beat the final boss. ... That's about 4 grinding hours worth of game play just to unlock a mechanic needed to beat the boss... The more that I played this game the more apparent it became that there's not enough theory crafting with items and decks and it's more about linear progression. 

Other reviewers summed it up perfectly, this game has an ""Illusion of choice"" where you think it's diverse with its roguelike mechanics but it's lacking in that department. If you like story-rich RPGs, this game offers an interesting, unique take on the genre where it's blending deck building roguelikes with RPGs. However, if you're a seasoned vet of StS/Monster Train and are looking for something to satisfy that itch until StS2 comes out, this may or may not be the game for you. 

 | Dialogue towards the end is indicative of more content but that content isn't there. Game is good for what it is, but I was disappointed to hear Mortis talking about the future and then see that the game was basically over for that character. | Great if you like StS and Wildfrost.  It's RPG themed with lots of backstory and character development.  The map path is again like StS but has a lot of secrets and unlocks.  The difficult is highly variable and so are the strategies.  It has a lot of content and replayability. It's also being actively developed so there should be more future content and the devs actually address bugs. | Ce jeu est une réussite. Je me suis demandé si il n'était pas un peu cher pour un deckbuilder et au final j'y ai trouvé plus de contenu que ce à quoi je m'attendais. Je n'ai pour l'instant joué que les 3 versions du personnage ""Perceval"" (reste deux autres personnages), et je n'ai même pas encore fini la campagne, car la progression n'est pas linéaire. Il y a du défi, le gameplay est classique, les combos sont nombreux, aucune partie ne se ressemble. J'ai bien aimé la narration, sans dévoiler trop, je peux dire que c'est original. Je pense à ce dialogue plein d'humour : ""Tu t'es suicidé ?"" ... ""Oui c'est moins douloureux que de combattre Millenis"". C'est un bon game dans le style Slay the spire, à savoir que vous contrôlez des personnages modélisés et animés. En conclusion si vous n'aimez pas les jeux de cartes ""free to play"" magnifiques, mais qui vous coûtent une blinde pour finir par copier le deck ultime que tout le monde joue (au moins jusqu'à la prochaine extension dans 3 jours) ... Si vous n'aimez pas non plus ces jeux beaux et courts (steamworld Hand of Gilgamesh) , ou mal équilibrés, trop simplistes (Vault of the void), voir énervants (Darkest Dungeon) ...

The spirits( a total of 24 and I have only played 6) are all wonderfully diverse with their own play styles. It's hard to pick an absolute favorite but if I had to choose a tie then it would be between Shadows and Thunder Bearer. 

I've never played the board game before this digital adaptation and the last time I tried one (Small World), it was completely underwhelming. 
This is exactly what every board to digital conversion needs to be. Awesome work by the dev team!
 | They have done a very good job recreating the game. The graphics are nice and the automation makes playing easy. There are a few bugs but by in large, very solid game. | Amazing game

I was addicted from the start and right to reaching the true end, extremely high replay value | I have played a lot of Roguelikes, and I think Rogue Legacy 2 is genuinely my favorite of them all.

76561198041304371,1270580,Mind Over Magic,3.6166666666666667,Simulation,0,"This is a really solid game and it really fills the light management niche quite nicely. 

It's fun to play around in if you like designing and the requirements for all the different types of rooms and spaces in the school vary enough to keep things interesting. It manages to offer a little challenge for those who like adapting on the fly while still being engaging enough for those that like to tear everything down and rebuild in a more organized, modular fashion.

As opposed to Oxygen Not Included, the game doesn't require you to delve into the management of pipes and material transport systems (which was my least favorite part of ONI). There's basic farming and production limits and storage but that's about the extent of it. You can quickly craft little zombie bots to do a lot of your hauling for you which frees up your teachers and students to teach and learn and dance in a circle around an enchantophone.

Staff and student scheduling is simple, though the grouping system is still a bit wonky. I also get the feeling that the devs intend that the 'best' way to play is to churn through your students and staff. Graduating and Retiring your staff is incentivised through the reward of relics which are used to upgrade subsequent students/staff, so if you are one of those players that gets attached to your characters you're going to be making the game more difficult for yourself.

Overall I think this is an easy recommend. The developers have done a great job on the skeleton of the game, so depending on your options chosen it can play as a challenging, resource-scarce, base survival game, a light magic-themed school/base designer game, or anywhere in between. | a cool twist on a rimworld/oxygen not included formula.

a very easy recommend. | Mind Over Magic is just great. I play it pretty much since it hit Early Access. One of the best Colony Sims there is. I can wholeheartedly recommend it. | Build your own school for young mages! This is a 2D simulation with many twists over other simulations.

It has exploration, lots of building (with arbitrary rooms and sizes), mage sims who work on the schedules you enter, smart groups for scheduling or tasks where you can create criteria and even new students will be automatically selected, RPG stats and skills, and turn-based old-school tactical magic combat. Although it's 2D, it has much of the creativity of a 3D building game. It will feel familiar to anyone who plays the genre of sims, but has some very unique gameplay elements.

You start at the site of an ancient school of magic destroyed by a curse, and your three starting professors (with the help of the founder's ghost) must recruit and train young mages to eventually become professors, to help lift the curse. The more students you train and graduate, the bigger your school can be, and the more potent the school becomes.

There are tons of secrets to find, unusual plants and materials to harvest, powerful relics to find and create, wands to upgrade, and deadly traps and events to handle.

I found this game quite entertaining, and am a fan of other Klei games such as Oxygen Not Included. This is not as complex as ONI, but has much of the charm and excitement of discovery through exploration. Unlike most RPGs like this, you are expected to graduate students and let them depart forever. Losing a mage may take a little time to replace, but everyone is replaceable. | I was playing this from the earliest versions, enjoying the game and hoping for it to become more with each regular update. The game went through a lot of changes until 1.0 (current version at the time of review), the devs listened to feedback and it turned out good, actually really fun. Its similar to ONI but less polished and with lesser freedom to how to solve problems, which are centerpiece of the game - you need x and for that you need y, z and c, but c requires a and d, or you could do just f and g, up to you. An ultimate indie magic base building fantasy is what I would call this game, a fair warning, a huge part of the game is base building (which is hugely predetermined at the start of the game by the seed), lesser part is focused on actual school management, and fights still need polish not to be repetitive. Also, on higher difficulties you will need excel tables to do well. I would recommend trying it if youre into this kind of games and/or watch a good deal of gameplay."

Overview: Tomb Raider (2013) is a reboot of the classic action-adventure franchise, offering a fresh origin story for the legendary adventurer Lara Croft. Developed by Crystal Dynamics, the game takes a more grounded and gritty approach to Lara's character, portraying her transformation from a vulnerable young woman into the hardened explorer she's known for. Combining exploration, puzzle-solving, and intense combat, the 2013 iteration offers a blend of action and survival mechanics set on the mysterious island of Yamatai.

Story: The story follows Lara Croft, who, along with her crew, becomes stranded on the island of Yamatai while searching for the lost kingdom of Himiko. The island, however, is home to many dark secrets, including a dangerous cult and other perils that put Lara’s life in constant jeopardy. Throughout the game, Lara faces various challenges and fights to survive, all while uncovering the island’s mysteries and discovering her own strength.

The narrative is engaging, focusing on Lara's personal journey and her development as a character. The story touches on themes of survival, trust, and the cost of discovery, with the stakes rising as Lara delves deeper into the island’s secrets. The characters are well-developed, though the focus is primarily on Lara, making her transformation and growth the heart of the plot.

Gameplay: Tomb Raider (2013) brings a mix of exploration, platforming, puzzle-solving, and combat. The controls are smooth and accessible, with an emphasis on both exploration and action. As Lara navigates the island, players engage in intense combat against various enemies, including mercenaries, wild animals, and the island’s cultists. The combat system is robust, offering a variety of weapons, from bow and arrows to firearms, as well as a range of stealth and melee attacks.

The game also features light RPG elements, allowing players to upgrade Lara’s weapons and abilities as they progress. This adds a layer of depth to the gameplay, encouraging players to explore the island thoroughly to collect resources and improve their equipment. There are also collectible items and hidden treasures scattered throughout the game, rewarding those who take the time to explore off the beaten path.

Graphics and Performance: The graphics in Tomb Raider (2013) are exceptional, with lush environments, stunning character models, and impressive lighting effects. The island of Yamatai is beautifully designed, ranging from treacherous cliffs to dense jungles, all rendered in high detail. The character animations, particularly Lara’s, are lifelike, and the facial expressions convey emotion and intensity. The cinematic cutscenes are integrated seamlessly into the gameplay, making the narrative feel fluid and immersive.

The game runs smoothly on most modern systems, with well-optimized performance. On higher settings, the visuals are breathtaking, but even at lower settings, the game still maintains a high level of quality.

Audio Design: The audio design in Tomb Raider is excellent, with a haunting and atmospheric soundtrack that complements the game’s tone. The sound effects are realistic, from the sounds of Lara’s footsteps on different surfaces to the crackling of fire and distant roars of danger. The voice acting, particularly from Camilla Luddington as Lara Croft, is solid, adding depth to the character’s emotions as she faces peril after peril.

Challenges: While the game is generally well-balanced, some sections can feel a bit repetitive, especially in terms of combat. Some of the puzzles are relatively simple, and while they provide a nice break from the action, they don’t challenge players too much. The difficulty ramps up during some of the more intense sequences, especially during the combat-heavy portions, but overall, the game provides an enjoyable experience without being overwhelmingly difficult.

Final Thoughts: Tomb Raider (2013) successfully reinvents the franchise, offering a modern and more personal take on Lara Croft’s origin story. The game blends action, exploration, and survival mechanics into a thrilling adventure, with a great narrative that makes you care about Lara’s journey. Its visuals, gameplay mechanics, and immersive world design make it a standout entry in the action-adventure genre.

Pros:

Engaging story with strong character development
Beautiful graphics and immersive world design
Satisfying combat mechanics with a variety of weapons
Excellent audio and voice acting
Exploration and collectibles add depth to gameplay
Cons:

Combat can become repetitive
Some puzzles are relatively easy
Certain sections of the game feel linear
Tomb Raider (2013) is a fantastic reboot that blends classic Tomb Raider elements with modern gameplay features. It offers an emotionally engaging and thrilling adventure for players who enjoy action, exploration, and survival mechanics. Highly recommended for fans of action-adventure games and those looking to experience Lara Croft's origin story in a fresh light. | Juegazo al principio no le tenia mucha fe pero despues de jugar un rato descubri que es un juegazo el combate y la exploracion es buenisimo y todos los coleccionables y  mejoras son espectaculares. 10/10 | Гарна та дуже драйвова гра.

76561198041304371,1158500,Between Two Castles - Digital Edition,0.25,Strategy,0,"  I bought my copy tonight and played the tutorial and a full game against the AI. I think there are some opportunities for DAISU but overall the gameplay itself is solid.

Opportunities:
- Tiles could be clearer on zoom in. I like that the text is there, but I want to explore the art on those tiles too. I want a button to do a big zoom like I can do on Tabletop Simulator or Tabletopia.
- The tutorial has text that cannot be sped up and it doesn't always fit in the text bubble. That needs to be a) easily skippable and b) fit in the text bubble. I know you need to read the text, but you shouldn't be guessing how fast I can read. I can read much faster than the ""next"" text arrow appears.
- Play Local has New Game and Tutorial buttons that appear to be greyed out, but they aren't. And you're supposed to click them.
- When playing with AI, you can't see what your partner drew/chose for use in your castle, so you can't synergize with them. This led to me making decisions for my castle in a vacuum.
- I finished the second tutorial, but it never acknowledged I finished it. It just wouldn't accept feedback anymore and I had to hit escape and 'exit' to go back to the menu.
- Music sometimes behaves odd. Leaving the tutorial to the main menu made the music abruptly stop and then go to a new music track. Perhaps a fade out and fade in would be less jarring.
- The green ""Ok"" or select button is an odd design choice, it doesn't feel like it matches the same aesthetic of the rest of the game, but I find myself punching the spacebar to accept my changes anyway. It's not a real big deal.

All of that said, I really enjoyed my time with BTCoMKL. The beta was ROUGH on my PC, it was very choppy, very jerky, this has been completely resolved. It runs so quick and it says all settings are on Epic despite me not having a gaming laptop at all. It's a cheap Dell my father-in-law bought that I put a SSD in.
Everything I love about BTCoMKL is still here in the PC version except for the plotting and planning with my partner. BUT it did feel significantly better to crap on one of my castles to try and take the lead from the AI who had the lead.

I like how quick the gameplay was. It was a delight. I hope the online lobby picks up. I think the price for the game was fair too. Of course I always find myself wanting to wait for a Steam sale but I'm not much of a PC gamer, so I typically have no problem waiting. That said, I don't regret not waiting. Congratulations Team Daisu.

Oh, one more item of delight I wanted to mention.. I love how adding tiles to the castle actually causes the castle to grow behind you. You see walls come up and towers rise. It's a very neat effect that made me smile a couple of times. Also, great job identifying the castles by color. That made it very easy to identify which castle I was working with. | Actually, the only way I would play this game is through this app: unlike the board game, this digital version permanently displays your and your opponents' score throughout the entire game.  In the board game you had no idea how well you or your opponents are doing, except until the very end.  This digital version totally solves that.  I own the physical game, but I will provably almost never play it again, unless one of my friends desperately requests it. And finally, the interface of this (digital) game and the overall design is done near-perfectly.  Kudos to the programmers. | Очень хорошо перенесли в цифру настольную игру. Не понимаю негативных отзывов, это же цифровая настолка и ожидать от неё большего бессмысленно.

Интерфейс сделан удобно, переключение между замками на кнопки ""1"" и ""2"", убрать интерфейс для выбора бонуса на ""Tab"", ну и самое главное - автоматический подсчёт очков. Как же это напрягало в конце игры всё посчитать, а потом ещё раз пересчитать чтобы ничего не забыть (и хорошо если в обоих случаях всё сошлось). С другой стороны кто-то может сказать, что ушел некий азарт от того, что в картонной версии ты лишь приблизительно прикидываешь в уме какой из двух твоих замков впереди по очкам и пытаешься балансировать. Всё же я считаю, что видеть очки по каждому замку сразу добавляет расчётливости к выбору в каждый ход.
Игра так же автоматически предлагает выбор бонусов по трём и пяти одинаковым комнатам чтобы не забыть. Ну и самое главное, что в игре грамотно реализовали возможность игрокам в онлайне принимать совместные решения, а в случае, если игроки не достигают консенсуса, то игра автоматически принимает за игроков наиболее выгодное (по её мнению) решение, исходя из выбранных игроками тайлов и ситуации на столе.
Итого: играть комфортно, никакого фидлинга. | The game gets super unfun when the ai will intentionally screw up your shared castles but will always make the best plays on castles shared between themselves.

Also this seems like it was made by a company that never played a board game before.  The lack of information is really inexcuable, you have no idea what choices will lead to in a way that isn't intended by the board game.  They just did a really bad job all around with this cheap game.

This game just isn't worth it. | Bilgisayar oyuncularına karşı orta seviye zorlukta oynadım. 5 bilgisayar oyuncusuna karşı yeterli puanı toplayıp kazanabildim. Şu sırada 6 oyuncuya karşı deniyorum. Grafikleri, ses efektleri, mekaniği güzel bir oyun. Tavsiye ediyorum."

Один из самых интереснейших рогаликов, в которые я играл. Здесь прекрасно всё: сюжет, механики, визуальная составляющая и саундтрек, но обо всём по порядку.

[h3]Сюжет[/h3]
Сюжет — по моему мнению, первый козырь игры, который цепляет сходу.
Прежний мир уже не вернуть, но мы помним — помним его части и по пути вспоминаем остальные локации и существ, в том числе и тех, кого мы не очень хотели видеть на дороге. Это завораживает и заставляет играть дальше, узнать мотивацию антагонистов и прочувствовать ощущения главного героя, его скорбь и груз его ответственности. Герой сам не помнит кто он такой, из-за чего и вытекает возможность смены класса. Мы не знаем его увлечений, но чувствуем в его словах... Надежду? Воодушевление? Не знаю.
Я прочёл все описания предметов, карточек и врагов, и могу сказать то, что тут всё продумано. Советую почитать на досуге, ведь это углубляет в мир игры. А ещё там написано всё от лица главного героя, что добавляет интереса к чтению.
[b]10/10[/b]

[h3]Механики[/h3]
Вам никто ничего не объясняет, вы всё должны пробовать на свой страх и риск. Нигде не напишут что за 10 гор/холмов вы резко вспомните ещё и о существовании гоблинов, или же о том, что вампиры не против полакомиться жителями деревни. Это увлекает и забавляет, а также в этот момент вы строите в голове сотни комбинаций с другими картами, которые вы можете применить в своем забеге.
Но комбинаций не очень много, и вы быстро их запомните, а также (по моему мнению) не хватает счётчика ландшафтных карт.
[b]9/10[/b]

[h3]Графика[/h3]
Я люблю пиксель-арты, и здесь всё идеально. Нет ярких цветов, что подобает мрачному сюжету. Очень понравились арты снаряжения и, особенно, боссов, что делает их незабываемыми врагами и примером отличного и продуманного врага. За всю игру мы увидим 2 кат-сцены и они шедевральны. Я даже поделился ими с друзьями, настолько мне они понравились, настолько в них влили душу.
[b]10/10[/b]

[h3]Саундтрек[/h3]
Очень понравился саундтрек в лагере, в первой кат-сцене и в титрах [spoiler]и в босс-файте с Омегой[/spoiler]. Когда его слушаешь, в голове так и возникают образы смерти и неизбежного конца, что очень сильно погружает в атмосферу и без того мрачного сюжета. blinch (автор сего аудио-творения) постарался на славу.
В остальных случаях — музыка просто подходит под стиль игры: не особо затянута, без сильных битов, не запоминается, и ощущается заЦИКЛенной (ba-dum-tss).

[h3]Итог[/h3]
Мне очень понравился данный рогалик. После The Binding of Isaac и Enter the Gungeon почувствовал что-то новое и необычное. Советую поиграть в данный шедевр тем, кто либо знаком с рогаликами и ищет точку интереса, либо тем, кто обожает пиксели и читать.
У меня всё. Благодарю Four Quarters за данный инди-шедевр, а вас за прочтение данного обзора.
[h2]10/10[/h2] | I'd give it a 7/10

I had a lot of fun playing this game on my steamdeck while traveling but I will 100% say this game feels kind of unfinished and poorly balanced. A lot of my enjoyment was derived from trying to figure out how to win on the harder difficulties with each character in spite of the poor balancing. 

It's definitely a neat concept that I havent seen done before and I enjoyed discovering neat combinations of tiles on the map like Village + Vampire Manor = Vampire Town. But I wish there was more of that. There should be dozens and dozens of combinations and interactions, but there's really not. It feels like there's content waiting to be implemented but it just never came. 

It's got some soft ""gambling"" elements in that you can end runs early to cash in your treasure or you can always go for another loop or attempt a boss in an all-or-nothing kind of way. It's fun but frustrating in a not so great way. | 玩的差不多了后觉得这游戏挺可惜的，创意确实很亮眼，当年还被TGA提名过，但是呢制作组并没有深耕的打算导致游戏就像个半成品一样。
1：作为主打肉鸽的游戏可重复游玩性却不如人意，到后期基本上就是无聊的刷，这一点可以说是致命的
2：游戏的自由度太高，而在前期惩罚也太高导致初上手的挫败感很强，新手引导特别不过关
3：到后期输了没感觉，赢了也没感觉，唯一感受到的就是时间流逝
总结的说，制作组愿意深耕的话以上问题都有解决的办法，凭借这个创意说不定可以做出一款里程碑式的作品，可惜他们并不在意，不过话说回来打折后的价格性价比没得说，值得喜欢独立游戏的各位买一个体验一下
 | Loop Hero is a game with an interesting concept that unfortunately falls flat due to its repetitive gameplay, lack of depth, and grind-heavy mechanics. While it initially hooks you with its unique premise, the novelty quickly wears off, leaving behind a tedious experience that struggles to hold your attention.

The gameplay loop, while innovative at first, quickly becomes monotonous. You’re essentially watching your hero walk in circles, placing tiles and hoping RNG works in your favor. While there’s some strategy involved in how you build the map, it doesn’t take long for the game to feel more like an idle clicker than a true roguelike or strategy game. The lack of direct control over your character makes the experience feel passive and unengaging.

Progression is painfully slow. The grind to gather resources and unlock upgrades drags on for far too long, and it often feels like the game is artificially padding its length. This grind-heavy structure completely saps the sense of accomplishment and makes every new run feel more like a chore than an exciting challenge.

The story and world-building are minimal, which is disappointing given the game's intriguing aesthetic. While the pixel art is charming and the music is atmospheric, these elements aren’t enough to compensate for the lack of compelling narrative or character development.

Loop Hero is a game that could have been great but falls short due to its repetitive gameplay, shallow mechanics, and grind-heavy progression. While it might appeal to players who enjoy idle games or background distractions, it’s hard to recommend for anyone looking for a more engaging or strategic experience.

Rating: 4/10 – A loop you’ll want to break out of. | La verdad es que este juego lo llevo jugando desde que salio, sin embargo lo jugaba pirateado en vieja pc, en cuanto mejore con respecto a pc lo primero que compre fue este juego y no eh parado de jugarlo."

76561198041304371,1292940,Cube Escape Collection,9.183333333333334,,47,"Cube Escape Collection is a collection of 9 games connected to the Rusty Lake series which I started a while back but never got to sit down and finish them. My first entry into the Rusty Lake series was Hotel, and thinking back on it, I really wish I had started with this game first. playing this makes the series make a lot more sense even if it's just a little bit with specific parts. 

the game itself is a point-and-click puzzle game, horror game, and mystery game, and personally, I think it does all of its jobs well. That being said, there were some puzzles where I was like, Man, what? or How the hell was I supposed to figure that out? But that issue slowly faded as I continued playing. I actually started to get accustomed to how they design puzzles and began really enjoying them. 

While there were times I got stuck for long periods (The Cave, I’m looking at you, screw that last section, lmfao), I never got so frustrated that I hated the game. In fact, it was the quite the opposite I actually felt mentally rewarded after solving the puzzles. That, combined with a solid episodic story, made the experience even better. The story is very confusing, like you really have to pay close attention, if you don't there's so much you'll end up missing with the story. hell there's so much I thought I missed even WHILE paying attention. so the game kind of forces your full energy. I honestly recommend before playing ""birthday"" and ""theater"" in this set of games to play Rusty Lake: Hotel and before you play ""The Cave"" to play ""Roots"" as it helps a lot with understanding everything in the story. I feel like without those games you will definitely sit there with the biggest eye brow raise. 

The closest game I can compare this vibe to is the Zero Escape series, though Cube Escape is definitely much goofier than anything in Zero Escape. | Rusty Lake is a series that confuses the heck out of me, but I still find myself drawn back to it time and time again. The Cube Escape Collection—a bundle of nine flash games from 2015 to 2018—brought together the origins of the overarching story that now spans multiple games. I originally started with Hotel, as while they do have a chronological order, they obviously don’t need to be played in that order.
I enjoyed it a lot, no surprise there, with the many WTF moments. Despite hitting some roadblocks where I couldn't figure what to do without a guide (difficulty tended to be all over the place), it was a great set of games to just jump into and have a quick session. In my opinion, peak puzzle gaming. | I have known this series since I was a child, I love all of these games, they are my childhood and it tis nice to experience them once more. Very good games, they have a very cool and dark atmosphere, kind of David Lynch like. I defenitlely recommend this game, even if you don't like puzzler games. | Still rhe best puzzle game ever, i have all the games from rusty lake and deserve to buy it and play it | Sem dúvidas, a franquia [b]Cube Escape[/b] é a minha favorita desde quando eu era pequeno. Quando encontrei essas obras de arte no Armor Games, devorei todos e me apaixonei pelo universo e pela história [i]completamente bizarra[/i], mas muito bem conectada entre dos jogos. Foi incrívelmente satisfatório fazer esse 100% sem consultar os vídeos de passo a passo a cada puzzle como eu fazia antigamente!

Was easy to 100% as the PVP game mode lets you do it in single player so you don't get screwed out of achievements. 9/10, would be a 10/10 if bugs were fixed. | è molto bello lo ho giocato tante volte e non ci si annoia mai"

Sure, there's an ironman mode you can play to avoid that for the most part, but micro transactions have still become a fundamental feature of the game itself which takes away from the grind many of us suffered in the early days, before you could basically buy experience or items from Jagex themselves. | amazing game, brings my childhood memories, a little bit the new combat is off but it is still good | fishng"

가볍게 즐길 게임으로 추천합니다. | Well...I tried a few games from this Publisher now, but honestly all of them were disappointing and complete waste of money.
The puzzles sometimes don't even make sense and I've tried so many different games in the past which had different ways of hinting a solution and i nearly never actually use ""hints"" in those games. Here most of the time nothing even got a hint to begin with. You're just supposed to figure out what the person behind it thought.
You are pretty guided on where to click in every game as they are all set up pretty similarly - I do prefer a rather open way to play.
I really can't understand the positive comments at all..
 | It's a quick game. I got through just under two and a half hours with some quick breaks, taking this at a leisurely pace. The game is quite linear. The puzzles weren't very hard but they were the kind of puzzles that my brain likes. It was a nice way to pass a few hours on a lazy afternoon. | Mc2games continues to put out these fun, immersive experiences akin to escape rooms with background stories.

Curious to see if they will eventually release a ""imperial collect"" bundle for $300+ just like CK II. | TL;DR: Base game at $10 is cool to play with your friends. Full price game/extra content isn't worth it


This game is good. Not great. Not Fantastic. Not bold or new or genre-defining.
It's a 'good' game that's gotten worse since being bought by Paradox for one poignant reason:
Their pricing is outrageous. Saying this is a $20 game is a stretch but I'll bite;
But the DLCs are not worth $5 per hero and $10/$20 for 'campaign expansions'.
There is a good reason why purchases are low and reviews are mixed for those items.
Paradox is gross for trying to monetize this game like Stellaris. | I don't recommend playing this game.

It is too fun. It is too addictive and every battle is pure novelty. It's endlessly playable and I just dropped 150+ in like....a month into this game.

The concept is great and so is the design, but it lacks tutorial and is overall pretty finicky. Majority of the time spent playing is wasted on running away from skeletons or constantly redirecting the people to actually go through with the action you give them. At some point, it gets so tiring and stressful to constantly have to set new paths just so that the little guys can avoid a tiny obstacle. Especially when it comes to hunting, it's just so impossible for the code to actually follow through without constantly losing track of the deer. I get that's the point, but with skeletons being so overpowered and having the ability to walk through fences, it leaves little to no room for actual progression if there is a constant need for intervention with every task. | This game feels almost...Unfinished. I understand the model the company is going for with the ""one game released every two weeks"", but it leads to not the best experience when playing the games.

Pyramida has no tutorial at all, and no way to figure out the commands of the game; there's nothing in it explaining how to start playing, and I had to come back to the discussion board to see if anyone else had the same problem (the answer is yes lol). There's also no pause button, a stylistic choice per the developer - however, the dev said you can just quit the game whenever you want to pause. If you can quit the game to pause, what difference does it make to not have a pause button?

The game was stressful but not in a ""oh, this is challenging!"" way. It was stressful in a way that killed any wish I had to keep playing. | It's a cute game, simplistic art style and so forth. However, the game can glitch at times and it lacks a tutorial - it's unclear on how you're supposed to play. Once you understand how, it's quite easy to pick up though.

和我之前玩过的放置增量游戏是完全不一样的思路，[b]如果你是那种纯懒人不想仔细思考增量和叠加的话我并不推荐你玩这款游戏[/b]。
糯米团子历代记[b]并不会[/b]让你一上来就体验指数增长的爽感。而是有种循序渐进，需要你去找各种技能和天赋的搭配，相辅相成，需要你随着自己的游戏体验从而搭建出自己的一套流派。靠自己摸索出来的一套方法然后带着一群小糯米干飞石头。
画风还是偏向于CRT这种复古风格的。即便如此，作者对糯米的动作细节把控相当到位。

[h2]玩法：[/h2]
很简单，就是带着糯米打大石头，用掉出的石子去造建筑、升级等等。
相对于传统挂机游戏来说，他的策略要素更多一点。也就是说，你不能开开心心挂机等着游戏结束。
以下内容含带剧透游戏机制的信息：
[spoiler]石子山堆高了之后会坍缩，然后给你个灵能点数，用来点高级技能。高级技能的总量是有限的（可以点天赋来增加），所以需要你去思考把他分配到有用的地方去。另外，坍缩后大石头会不断吸小石头，吸收速率会随时间和坍缩次数加快，速率会因为每次坍缩重置。[/spoiler]
[strike]然后就是带领你的糯米干飞臭石头。[/strike]

[h2]相对第一次通关所需的游戏时长：[/h2]
我个人花了9.5个小时，根据评论区来看，如果你不适应这个游戏的玩法的话，可能会花上十几甚至更多的时长来通关，合理运用游戏机制才是关键。

[h2]先说优点：[/h2]
[list]
    [*]直观的表现了诸如“货币”这种挂机游戏数据。
    [*]各种复杂机制的展开比较平缓，引导给的比较好。
    [*]正反馈度高。
    [*]糯米可爱。
[/list]

[h2]个人认为的缺点：[/h2]
[list]
    [*]每次转生重新构建一套系统的时间相对来说比较长，导致试错成本相对来说比较高。
    [*]后期天赋点获取起来相当麻烦，因为它是根据你的收集速率来计算的，获取难度会随着游戏时间推进越来越高。以至于我游戏都通关了还有5个天赋没解锁。
    [*]伤害分析面板不够细化，以至于后期要做到伤害的最优解比较麻烦。
    [*]流派不够多样，看起来很多，但实际上到最后还是容易归如冰火流的思路，部分天赋比较鸡肋。当然也有可能是官方对其余流派的引导不够好。
    [*]到后期玩家容易陷入一种舒适圈，对其他的建筑难以进行深入的测试，比如攀岩、喷气、机器人、弱点这几个系统根本没有办法进行深入的测试和应用。
[/list]

[h2]一些流派上的提示？（剧透警告）[/h2]
[spoiler]
第一次重生至少准备3点再去重生，不然比较浪费时间。
开局首推火流，用其他的几个小技能来互相促成。主动技能头击糯米和运输糯米都点一下。
后期解锁冰与火之歌后走冰火流。用头击糯米来喷火（需要解锁糯米喷气实验室），靶场替换成冰箭，可以的话点一个把子弹替换成箭的天赋，视自己情况招几个糯米。
后期石头吸收速度比较快，适当点几个技能可以缓冲一下吸收速率。
火箭给石头上脆弱属性是有必要的，一个可以搭配其他天赋，另一个可以直接把石头送入仓库。
种地很有必要，但首推吐酸和捡箭（即领航员）的植物。如果你要单纯刷石头的话，请不要点吐酸的植物，因为他会影响石头的飞行距离，后期都是靠石头的脆弱属性直接送入仓库的。吐酸植物的目的就是为了让石头堆积，快速进入坍缩阶段。捡箭的植物可以回收大批量的箭，能够更好的让石头进入冰冻循环。
[/spoiler]

[h1]最后，祝大家的糯米早日干翻大石头，达成石头自由。[/h1] | (the) Gnorp Apologue is a clicker/idle game hybrid.

I will start this review by mentioning that this game is not a set-and-forget type of game! You will need at most 5 minutes or 10 minutes periods of AFKing at some point, but this game is VERY active and engaging. The game only lasts between 10 and 30 hours (depending on how well you understand the synergies of the talents) and how active you are.

The art style, animations, music, story even the tooltips are all superb. This is one of the few games that really deserves it 'Overwhelmingly Positive' reviews. It was fun from start to finish, getting the achievements required some good thinking and due to it's shorter length than average, you are constantly finding new mechanics, buildings, talents, synergies, etc... until the very end of the game!

（当然我个人原因影响也很大，在玩《Cocoon》之前正好玩了好几个解谜游戏，多少对这个类型有点腻了，本想冲着最佳独立处女作这个名号体验一下被惊艳的感觉，结果又是解谜，潜意识会带有排斥心理……如有冒犯，都是我错。）

游戏全程大概4-8h，进入游戏以后置身于一个类似沙漠的橙色地区，主角是一只emm，蛾子。
[spoiler]因为这游戏翻译过来就叫“茧”，主角自然而然会被认为是飞蛾，而剧情也会想当然地觉得是破茧而出之类的，事实证明大差不差，就，很直白……没感觉到什么新意，差一点点深度。[/spoiler]

在简单地散步后会发现，这游戏操作极其简单，只有方向键和互动键，全程无文字，的确做到了极简至上，但解谜就纯靠个人理解了，很需要玩家具备耐心和想象力。

前期的解谜难度并没有很高，轻松解开会让人收获小小的成就感，而当打第一个boss，拿到第二个球开始套娃后，整个游戏就变得越来越复杂，在第三个第四个球出现以后，更是不断地传球-传送-传球-传送，传的我都心累了。

中后期的反复交互和置换会有点令人疲惫，而在做完一切之后，又发现其实是很简单的逻辑，但缺乏一点震撼，期待应该是“哇，居然是这样！原来还能这样！”那种恍然大悟、大梦初醒的感觉，实际只让我有“有点无聊，晕晕的、头痛、想不出、看看攻略吧、哦这样啊”平静的疯感……

当然，很大一部分原因还是，我最近玩解谜游戏玩累了腻了，而且此前被《Animal Well》惊艳到，所以对这部同样遗憾落选年度最佳独立的《Cocoon》产生了较高的心理预期，拉高了期待阈值，实际玩的时候又没有太提起兴趣，我自己问题很大……

但平心而论这部游戏真的能达到神作水平吗？我对此还是持怀疑态度的。
首先流程真的短，我在磕磕绊绊又卡关的情况下，也才玩了7个多小时就全成就通关了，如果时长能达到10小时以上，我会更加认可一些。
其次，无论是画面、剧情、音乐、操作等等各方面，包括游戏的主旋律—解谜，都只是勉强做到80分的优秀水平，属于均衡发展没有短板，但也没有特别让我眼前一亮的感觉。

不过这游戏有一点值得点赞，就是没有一点文字和指示，完全靠场景引导玩家，而且是绝对线性的流程，以百分比来记录玩家的游戏进度，且无需保存，随进随出，也可以随时跳转到已经解锁的任意百分比进度中，应该也是极简主义下的产物，这点非常好评！

总之，这是个需要专注和沉浸的解谜游戏，很优秀但不够神作。 | [h2]Playdead is playing dead[/h2]
丹麦的游戏产业相较于同为北欧国家的瑞典和芬兰规模较小，在国际游戏界的影响力也相对较小。然而，丹麦依然有不少值得关注的游戏公司和作品。或许许多人不知道，全球最知名的游戏引擎之一——Unity，正是来自丹麦，它成为了无数手机游戏和独立游戏制作的首选工具。丹麦国内大型的游戏公司主要以《杀手》系列的开发商IO Interactive，以及手游《地铁跑酷》的制作商SYBO为代表。提到独立游戏公司，也有几家不容忽视。曾制作出《麦克斯与魔法标记》系列的Press Play，在被微软收购并关闭后，部分前员工重组成立了Ghost Ship Games，并推出了备受好评的《深岩银河》。丹麦另一家享誉世界的独立游戏公司便是本部分的主角——Playdead。

2004年，Arnt Jensen因厌倦了大型游戏公司的工作，带着自己的想法从IO Interactive离职。两年后，他与Dino Patti共同创立了Playdead。2010年，Playdead推出的《地狱边境 | Limbo》在XBOX上惊艳亮相，次年登陆PC平台。2016年，《Inside》再度发布，荣获无数奖项，两款作品双双进入游戏史上最伟大的游戏榜单。然而，至今已过去9年，Playdead的下一部作品依然不见踪影。这让人不禁担忧，Playdead是否已经成了又一个不会数3（第3部作品）的游戏公司？自2017年起，工作室开始发布零星的信息，我们得知他们的新作将是一个科幻题材的3D开放世界冒险游戏，采用虚幻5引擎。不过，除了几句话和几幅概念图，至今没有更多实质性内容，甚至连游戏的名字都尚未揭晓。

Playdead到底发生了什么？除了内部人员，外界知之甚少。我猜测除了横版转3D带来的挑战，核心员工的离职可能也是导致公司沉寂的原因之一，特别是联合创始人Dino Patti和首席游戏设计师Jeppe Carlsen的离开。虽然创始人兼游戏总监Arnt Jensen才华横溢，但他性格较为内向，有时显得优柔寡断。而Dino则截然不同，外向自信，做事果断，充满行动力。Jeppe作为首席游戏设计师，不仅技术过硬，还是一位非常出色的谜题设计师。2016年，也就是《Inside》发布同年，这两位核心人物都相继离开了Playdead。或许正是缺少优秀的谜题设计师和项目推动者，才导致了Playdead至今未能交出新作。尽管如此，Arnt Jensen仍然在，希望有朝一日，Playdead能够带着新的作品重返大众视野。

[h2]一星沉寂，两星初耀[/h2]
2016年，Playdead的两位创始人Arnt Jensen与Dino Patti因意见不合分道扬镳，最终Dino带着720万美元的补偿离职。此后，他与英国动画师Chris Olsen共同成立了Jumpship工作室，并于2022年发布了首款作品《Somerville》。关于这款作品，我曾写过详细的测评。它仍是一个横板电影化平台游戏，但没有跳跃，增加了纵深移动。游戏的互动和玩法有所欠缺，更像一部叙事节奏不佳，而且全程没有文本的动画，俗称不好玩。不过，游戏内隐藏了一条非常有趣的长线索，给我带来了十分奇妙的体验，使得我对它的整体评价仍然保持积极。

同样是在2016年，Playdead的首席游戏设计师Jeppe Carlsen和程序员兼作曲家Jakob Schmid也离开了公司。两人随后在哥本哈根成立了独立工作室Geometric Interactive，并于2023年推出《Cocoon》。这款游戏彻底告别了横板平台跳跃的玩法，转为俯视角，操作极简，除了方向控制外，仅需一个互动键。游戏的亮点在于其独特的“世界球”机制，即可以跳出一个关卡世界，然后随身携带。借由球体穿越，又能创造出多层嵌套的空间结构。

[h2]体验过程[/h2]
游戏刚出的时候我就看到了，正好也是我可能会喜欢的类型。不过，当时近百块的价格让我略有退却，前阵子冬促终于出了半价，到达了我的预期价位，正好也刚打完一款投入超过200小时的大作，很适合拿来调剂。一开始，我打算让妻子玩，我在旁边看着。虽然操作上没有问题，但妻子适应里面的空间感和谜题仍有点吃力，后来我就从头自己玩了。流程不长，感觉倒是过了挺久，意外地没用看任何攻略就独立打完了。通关后意犹未尽，又重开了一遍准备把缺的成就/收集补上。玩了一阵后，发现通过载入功能和收集指南可以非常容易的把收集找全，遂放弃了当时的流程。最后，我带着祛魅后的眼光重新审视了整个游戏的流程和设计，遂写下这篇测评。

[h2]昆虫科幻、股掌世界[/h2]
所谓昆虫科环指的是贯穿整部游戏中出现的各种昆虫造型元素，外加整体的科幻主题，也可以称为生物科技。刚开始诞生的主角长着一对翅膀，像只大苍蝇，或者说蟑螂，或者蝉，总之很有昆虫的特点。从沙子中浮现出来的机械体明显是照着昆虫造的，有触角。漂浮的球形生命体，也是用于打第一个BOSS的生物，长得很像西瓜虫。大部分的BOSS都有着陆生或者水生昆虫的特征，更别提最明显的两个意向——琥珀和茧。用于降下路障和开门的小飞虫会被琥珀困住，有个BOSS也是借助琥珀打败的。游戏主角诞生于一个茧中，甚至游戏的名字Cocoon也为茧的意思，全都是昆虫世界所常见的。游戏通过这一切设计使整个游戏产生一种异域（exotic）感，再加上环境设计形成一系列”奇观”，成为驱动玩家继续下去的一大诱因。

这一切都跟本作的艺术总监Erwin Kho有关，他从大自然中寻找创作灵感，模仿昆虫建筑巢穴设计环境，融合了有机元素和未来主义元素。在设计生物时他还受到节肢动物启发，如螳螂、龙虾、蜘蛛，以及水母、海星等海洋生物，尤其是海胆壳。Erwin还从野兽派和装饰艺术建筑中汲取了很多灵感，让其中的文明利用本地材料建造宏伟建筑，最终达成神秘、美丽、精致和优雅的效果，还有一种古老传说的忧郁感。游戏的画面虽采用低多边形和低纹理这种极简主义风格，却充分利用几何和色彩，光照效果也很棒，整体看起来十分舒服。部分几何式设计还令我想起《EVA》里面的使徒。

把一个世界变成小球并把玩的想法很酷，在主角身上看起来倒像屎壳郎推粪球，哈哈，开玩笑！游戏视觉中重要的世界球元素，也是解谜设计的核心。这种一球一世界的设计，有点像《加勒比海盗》里面的瓶中船，像极了玩具，让人忍不住想拿来在手中把玩，哪个男孩能拒绝这样的玩具呢？游戏后期着重呈现小球即星球的概念，用黑色环形包裹世界球并旋转看起来简直就是星球和环带的微缩版。结局中，几个小球真的变成了星球，环绕在一颗奇怪的恒星周围。另外，《黑衣人》（1997）结尾那段带来的天外有天意向更为直观和细思极恐。我们的宇宙只是别人手中的玩具，这一意向让人恐惧、无力和绝望，恰与克苏鲁式的恐怖是重合的。也许这就是制作人Arnt Jensen脑子里那个想法的来源。

[h2]简单而精妙的谜题[/h2]
游戏核心的世界球如前所述，来自于跳出一个关卡世界，然后随身携带的想法。这个点子虽不像《传送门》和《时空幻境》的核心那么简洁且有极高的扩展性，制作者仍然玩出了花。基础性的玩法自然是内部存放，当我们有了两个球并发现可以将其中一个放入后跳出带着走的时候，属于这个游戏独有的魅力就释放出来了。这个存放玩法成为基础操作，后来扩展为多个存放和嵌套存放，令人没想到的是，用于降下路障和开门的小飞虫居然也可以通过琥珀存放在内部。此外，还有一个通过进入球内躲避外部危险的玩法，但只出现了一次。

每个球体内都有一个守护者，将其击败后会解锁球体自身的能力，相当于给予玩家新能力，限制是一次只能带一种。上桥、升台、瞬移、射击，四种能力各有用处，哪里能用一眼便知。不过能明显感觉出制作者对前两者的偏爱，从头到尾几乎到处都在用，紫球到后期完全没有存在感。白球只能在特定区域射击，不与其他球体配合的话发挥空间不大（除了令人紧张的打钻石环节）。后期所设计的白色和绿色的配合解谜是个亮点，叠加橙球形成的几个三层嵌套谜题更是令我惊呼。除了球体相关谜题，游戏内还有颇多辅助型设计，比如各种开关、小飞虫和琥珀、跳板和管道、拉扯球体远程控制、找密码、四足运球器和挡球栏，子弹反射墙，乃至BOSS战等。空中扔球和两个四足器相关的谜题设计很棒，其余无需逐一说明，但明显增加了流程的新鲜感和丰富度。

游戏后期出现了让人有点迷惑的交替嵌套设计，绿球本被橙色套住，但是手头又有一个绿球，里面有个绿球和橙球，而我们正身处绿球之中。仔细查看流程后我才发现，原来是游戏通过大门将不同颜色世界连接。先是在紫色球内，带着橙套绿通过连接大门进入绿色世界，从绿球中跳出到橙球，带着绿套橙又回到绿球……晕了吧，这段解谜虽不难，但解释起来还得费点功夫，后面还有跳出后回到原位BUG般的设计。这一切很容易让人想到诺兰的《盗梦空间》里的多层梦境，以及计算机中的递归。从这些设计可以看出制作者其实能设计出十分复杂的谜题来，比如更加多层次的ABA，BAB类嵌套，但他并没有这么做，而是尽量降低难度以保证流程的流畅性。制作者还曾有过很多没有做进游戏的想法，比如有个随节拍变化的节奏球，能冻结时间的冰雪球，用于潜行的隐形球，以及镜面球等。他们还做过让玩家收集传送器的组件，最终让其飞起来的一大段流程，但并不想玩家在一个球里停留的时间太长，最终遗憾删掉了。

本作的谜题经过难度控制，相比一般解谜类游戏较为简单，适合作为入门之作。除了设计层面，游戏内的操作和切换选项十分有限，使得很多谜题可以通过反复尝试解开，基本不会让人卡住，况且还通过播放音乐的方式提醒玩家做对了。除开一眼看明白的初级谜题，大部分都遵从三步式解法（我自己命的名，不知有没有这个说法），即“想当然尝试”，“挫折后思考”和“恍然大悟”。游玩时很多走过的路径会完全封闭，阻止玩家回去，其实是在说以前的场景不会参与当前谜题，放心尝试就行。地图看似有些开放性分支，实际上整体被设计的死死的，极为线性。你所以为的多种组合方式和携带哪个球，只是发现正确组合前的尝试而已。玩惯了解谜游戏的玩家自然会对本作简单的谜题设计嗤之以鼻，但我觉得还可以。设计师可以预测玩家行为，基本都是有意为之，与其他方面也是平衡的。只是那种一开始大喊，“不可能，绝对不可能”，但解开后惊呼“设计师是天才”的时刻还可以更多。或许这就是本作错失2023年度最佳独立游戏的原因之一。

[h2]天外有天[/h2]
《Inside》究竟讲了个什么故事？至今仍有很多玩家猜测，提出各种假说。这正是因为游戏通过强烈的情绪渲染和隐喻叙事构建了丰富的想象空间，但又因没有任何文本而具有开放性。 本作则不然，缺少了Arnt Jensen为Playdead的作品注入的紧张、压抑、神秘感以及哲学意味，可以说《Cocoon》全篇没有明确的情绪和目的。本作主题较为轻松，没有任何追逐。BOSS战和空中瞄移动钻石时虽略有紧张感，但并不会死亡，最多就是回到几分钟以前再来一次。通过前期的环境观察和解谜，玩家能摸索出一套固定流程：找小虫——>解密码——>躲琥珀——>找路开门——>打BOSS。四个BOSS打完后，综合利用能力所有再去击败最后一个守护者，拿回被夺走的三个世界球，回到起初位置。最终，主角完成进化，终于得以真正展翅飞翔。所有球体形成正确排序，展示所经历的一切之外还有一层，即宇宙建筑师。

探索途中会解开11个月球祖先，但意义不明。游戏内置一个触发方式超复杂的隐藏结局，难度高到玩家几乎无法独立解开的程度。最终多出来的一段动画仍然让人不明所以，预示还有续作？我从主创们的采访看来，他们也并没有花多少心思用在故事上。艺术总监Erwin专门写过故事，但Jeppe并不太感兴趣，且认为故事并不重要，还是以谜题作为流程第一驱动力。玩家难以对一切产生共情，也没有什么惊心动魄的故事可以琢磨，最多只能理解到循环嵌套主题，一切都是场试炼，并感叹天外有天。这个结局难以和《Limbo》和《Inside》相比，当时的我可是瘫软在椅子上茫然盯着屏幕久久无法平静。这或许就是优秀和伟大之间的距离，果然天外有天。 | 好顶级的想象力和表现力……虽然游戏过程中没有任何文字还是感觉稍微在引导方面做得有些不足，但是配上这种深度抽离现实宏观世界的超强想象力地图反而在某种程度上加强了面对陌生情况的被孤立感以及解开谜题时的爽感……如果不是紫色玻璃球boss那段太手残给我打红温了于是怒删游戏修复心灵（？）说不定能在去年就体验完这件艺术品的ㅠㅠ

以及不得不提一下紫色玻璃球那段地图的形象设计对我来说稍微有点恶心啊啊啊不过依然能感觉到创作者非常活跃的想象力TUT重新拾起来继续攻略boss之后一直没搞清到底音乐从哪个通道播放但是想着反正也没配音听不听声音没差也就一直没管（）在结尾的时候慌忙找耳机插上手柄也还算是完整体验了结尾演出的视听盛宴🥺简直可以和The Last Campfire并列我的长解谜游戏榜首，主线全程没搜攻略虽然也卡卡的但是通关的瞬间真的爽翻了🤲

76561198041304371,1604030,V Rising,0.0,"Action, Adventure, Massively Multiplayer",0,"First thing, this game is very very addictive, I'd give you that. Once you start a game you will find it very very hard to stop playing. My 227 hours play time should be evidence enough to prove my point. But sadly, among my 227 play time, 99% of it was solo play. I would dearly like to join a clan and play with some other players. But alas, although the game does support clan play, some feature of the game or should I say lack of it, made it very unfriendly for clan play.  

The one thing I hate about this game is that all members within a clan shares everything. And in everything, I mean freaking EVERYTHING. All you can do is to trust in your clan member's ethics and hope they won't rob you blind when you're not in the game. Even the stuff in your so-call personal strongbox can be access by your clan members. So what good is a personal strongbox if everyone can get the stuff you stashed in it. I mean, why put in a personal strongbox in the first place is its utterly useless. At least put in some permission settings for the owner to restrict access to their stuff. 

Another thing is the loot system. I once cleared a tier 2 rift boss when another player came in and took all my loot dropped from the boss. The player was not even a clan member, just another solo player who came in and ninja looted all my stuff. 

All of this BS is making it very hard for anyone to form and invite people into a clan unless all the clan members are also real life friends. No one likes to be betrayed and rob of their hard earn possessions when they are not looking.

But, after mentioning all the bad stuff, I'm still gonna recommend this to others. The solo play is still worth playing. | 76小时全成就，已经被多人残酷模式狠狠地恶心到了。游戏虽然有诸多可圈可点的设计，但瑜不掩瑕，其槽点之多让人忍不住想要打个差评好好说道说道。

1.异常不合理的数值，多动症到离谱的boss以及仿佛断了腿一般的主角性能。玩家作为一个高贵的吸血鬼，也是人见狗嫌走到哪被打到哪，机动性比隔壁魂游的不死人都要差的多的多。平时顶着残疾人的移速跑图就已经无比折磨了，打boss时更是只能依靠cd10秒以上的闪现来躲避攻击，背板躲招式几乎是刚需。而对比鲜明的是boss各种位移闪现aoe，快到根本看不清抬手的大范围攻击以及一刀砍一半血的离谱伤害技能比比皆是：制作组对boss的理解显然还停留在力大砖飞上，所谓的残酷模式就是闭着眼睛填数值，甚至多人打boss的体验远不如单人来的舒适，不仅boss的血量会超级加倍，满场不间断召唤的小怪和额外招式也是恶心至极。

2.后期极度枯燥乏味的物资刷取，以及重复度高达100%的科技树系统。整个游戏前中期还算有些新鲜感，但默认设置的合成材料倍率以及制造时间简直让人不知所谓：造一块铁就需要好几分钟，而建筑和武器又需要消耗大量各种不同的物资，导致时间都花在了反复刷取材料等待合成上面。每进入下一个科技阶段，材料其实只是换了个名字以及更加麻烦的获取方式，甚至还得手动去翻箱倒柜的刷取一些进阶材料，才能获得批量制造的许可。如此无聊的重复作业，以及套娃一般合成配方一直持续到了通关为止。此外，游戏后期还有许多明显只是为了拉长游戏时间的恶心设计，例如武器碎片、宝珠随机词条的刷取，还有限时的大地图关卡，每次只能刷取少的可怜的暗影碎片，用量却又多的吓人。

3.为了所谓的pvp平衡性而牺牲的pve体验。这一点是最让人无法理解，游戏内看似有多个法术体系和流派，还有多种武器装备，按理说应该能够支持自由度非常高的bd系统，但制作组侧重pvp的莫名自信让几乎绝大部分的法术都变成了换皮的垃圾，boss无脑免疫控制更是让部分法术显得有些小丑。相似的模板换个颜色改一改词条，就又是一个新法术了；只能装备两个法术的底层逻辑让构筑毫无自由可言，更加不存在什么所谓的法术之间的combo，数值给的也是无比保守，简直是生怕玩家打怪打爽了。

4.不合理的奖励解锁顺序。这游戏的法术是按照等级123的顺序来解锁的，打赢特定的boss可以给一个指定等级的技能点，而每个等级的法术又有好几个——制作组看似贴心地让你有选择优先解锁的权利，但实际上后解锁的技能本就是被玩家淘汰下来的，装备栏又只有两个，导致后解锁的技能点处在一个食之无味，弃之可惜的尴尬境地，塞进boss奖励里多少有些敷衍。此外，游戏的装备分为了不同流派，而高级的衣服也是需要打boss解锁的。策划的大智慧就体现在，他们非常贴心地给你安排了一个线性的解锁顺序，保证你在当前阶段只能先穿着没有任何词条的白板衣服去打boss，然后依次解锁制造台、制造材料1、制造材料2...直到你打完了前面所有的boss，都快要通关这个章节了，你才能做出一套完整的衣服。而这套衣服还没有焐热，当你们打完章节头目后，恭喜你——新的上位白板衣服又出现了，快拿着它去挑战下一章的新boss吧。

...其实还有不少零零散散的槽点，一时半会也想不起来/懒得写了，那就先这样吧。这个游戏明明有不少的优点，但在诸多槽点的结合之下，我的游玩体验并不是很好。考虑到它并不是一个半成品，而是已经开发了多年的游戏，部分问题的出现更是让人难以理解...好消息是目前制作组貌似还在继续更新游戏，这一点确实值得肯定。只能说，希望它早日成为一个更加优秀的游戏吧。 | V Rising é um jogo incrível e muito divertido.

Thank you, devs! | a little to the left is a satisfying puzzle game with fun, creative ways to tidy up but the daily tidy is a drag. doing it for consecutive days gets boring and since it's required for 100% achievements, it ends up feeling more like a chore especially when the puzzles are underwhelming. great game, just wish the daily part wasn’t such a hassle. | This game scratches an itch i didn't know i had. I want to keep playing this game. I wish it were a bit longer, but I'm glad there's DLC at least | 打折期入手还蛮划算，关卡不算少，个别关卡更像是强迫症？少了一些其他的方案 | A great game to spend your free time in a chill way. The art-style is nice, calm colours are easy on the eyes, so even after a hard day you'll be able to enjoy the game. A Little to the Left offers multiple solution levels and an option to skip some levels which really helps out at points. The puzzles are fun to complete, but some of them are slightly bugged. Items need to 'click' in their spots so sometimes you might find yourself stuck on a level just because the spoon was off it's designated location by half a pixel. The game also offers daily tasks. Even though the daily tasks are random I found myself bored of them after 10 or so days because they start repeating themselves, so getting the 100 day achievement took longer than it should've. If achievements aren't important to you I'd say that the Seeing Stars DLC is not worth to get, the puzzles are not as good as the other ones. Overall, A Little to the Left is a cozy and relaxing game, a little overpriced, but definitely worth it with a discount. 8.5/10 (0.5 for the cute cat)."

76561198041304371,1668690,Alina of the Arena,0.0,"Indie, Strategy",0,"Alina of the Arena is an awesome game. I never tried a deck builder like it before, but can’t stop playing. I first started expecting not much but with every run I learned more about mechanics, enemies, tactics etc. and still have not tried out or learned everything. Only downside is that I would like to have more… maybe a part two will happen in the future? I hope so!

I don’t want to get in much details but just be aware that this game is not only a deck builder but also a rogue like and tactics game. Give it a try if you are interested.

To make the start a bit easier let me give you some advice, but be aware of spoilers:
[spoiler]- Always think ahead. Not only what cards you might play next but your positioning!
- Cards or items which let you avoid or reduce damage in any way are very powerful. This can be achieved not only by movement, but kicks, pushes, interrupts, traps, abilities, items etc. – be creative
- Achievements or unlocking new classes can be done with all difficulties
- Classes differ in their play style. Some are better for offence, others for defence (block) or can do both well. I tried them all. Some are very fun and insanely powerful like pyromancer, hunter or mercenary. Others or more difficult to handle like samurai or deprived
- You can drink a potion after a fight without taking it in your item slot. Just click on the potion in the menu where you can replace items which were thrown into the arena and choose the option “use”
- You can reload ranged weapons with all combat cards if they have the correct colour even if they are defence (block) cards
- Two-handed ranged weapons can be reloaded with both red and blue combat cards
- Reloading a weapon with a combat card does not cost any action points
- Using a combat card which can only be used once per fight, is not exhausted if you use it for reloading[/spoiler] | If you like roguelike deckbuilders and tactics games, you'll probably go on a binge with this one. To be honest, there's nothing groundbreaking about the few new things this game adds to combat based deckbuilders, it's just that Alina of the Arena tramples over every mark outstandingly. | 很好玩的遊戲

很需要考慮每一步的動作

這遊戲有RELOAD的機制我覺得很棒

常常不小心沒想好出了下一步就死局很尷尬

不過RELOAD是當格事件重選(包含商店格，所以可以洗卡片裝備之類的，包含初始商店都能洗)這點超佛心

可惜的是作者表示真結局沒有後續的東西，稍嫌遺憾

總之這個遊戲非常推薦~ | Fun srpg roguelike most of the way but the final boss is a ludicrous difficulty spike with too many gimmicks. Imo Fighting In Tight Spaces is a superior game but this might be worth picking up on sale | A unique roguelike style that is seen in many similar games of its kind, but A.O.T.A's system and art illustrations for weapons, characters complements the theme and UI very well."

You go from hoarding coconuts as your only source of food to eventually farming vegetables and keeping livestock. You go from sleeping on a crappy bed of leaves and having monkeys stealing your belongings, to eventually building your own house with a shed and a nice bed. 

The mechanics constantly surprised me with how in-depth they are. You might think you hit the jackpot when you find a few banana trees but your character will start getting depressed if you force them to eat literally nothing but bananas for days. If you try to live off coconuts too much you'll get diarrhea. It's actually possible to make certain animals go extinct if you keep hunting the same kinds over and over. 

Rainfall is super important for your consistent water source but it's totally random whether it rains or not. I didn't realise this until I went over a month in one game without any rain. At first this seemed really harsh but I think it's better for gameplay as it teaches you not to rely on one source of water/food/protection etc and to constantly be thinking of ways to diversify or to prepare for emergencies. 

The only thing I struggle with in this game is repetitiveness. There are different characters or even custom characters that work slightly differently but ultimately you are still in the same jungle with the same locations and same animals and same research tree. So I'll have a lot of fun playing a game for 10~ hours then die stupidly because I lost track of time in the middle of the jungle and couldn't find my way home or something like that, but I need to wait a few months to try again otherwise it feels too same-y. I wish the dev would come out with more iterations of this game like medieval fantasy style so I can swap between them :) | Absolutely loved this game.  I failed my first couple of runs and was beginning to think I just couldn't survive!  But I prevailed with a ""win"" after a very long run.  My favorite part about the game? Definitely the way that even though it's ""just a card game"", your day to day survival really tells a story.  There were some moments in the game that will stick with me almost as if I was actually on an island trying to survive - you know, like when I had almost every status effect that you could have and was in my mud hut in the middle of the night trying to cool down and calm down but couldn't sleep because I was too hot.  Or trying to feed my befriended macaque who was slightly too hungry / unhappy so he instead bit me so I tried to feed him again so he bit me again.  Incredible!"
76561198041304371,1705140,Final Profit: A Shop RPG,9.016666666666667,"Casual, Indie, RPG, Simulation",3,"i really like this concept and idea. if you're looking for a almost casual rpg that has plenty to do but doesn't really block you from exploring or stumbling around then this is the game for you. | A very fun game for those that enjoy a merchant game. A lot of fun quirks thrown in, side activities to make money multiple endings, and a consistent sense of progression. Especially on sale, this is a gem, but even at full price it's a lovely experience. Kudos to the Dev. | This is simply a fun game.

The humour is dumb fun, the gameplay is simple but varied, and almost everything in it is creative and interesting.

It's not a traditional shop style game. You don't haggle with customers. During the shop phases, you just restock each item into its own slot when it gets sold (until you automate it). The more interactive parts (at least early) are finding new customers, new items to sell or getting stock. Some items you need to craft, some items you need to do a scavenger hunt for, some you need to grow...

The game also has 3 distinct 'acts' that, again, are nicely varied to keep it interesting. You go from super poor, to moderately well off, to super rich, and the way you're making money and what you're doing between visits to your shop are very different between these acts.

I saw another review say it was grindy - its a shop game. Your goal is to make money, usually by selling stuff. There is obviously an element of grinding sales, but it doesn't overstay its welcome. It's like well balanced encounters in a JRPG, you don't complain about the fighting.

Took me 25 hours to complete the story which seems like it would be reasonable for most people.

Great game. Well done dev. | Got this as a random recommendation for niche games that had come out over the past couple years. It did not disappoint at all, and for only $15 bucks it offers a lot of content (I put in a couple dozen hours doing all the side content in the game before getting to the ending and I haven't even touched the roguelike mode yet). 

Main gameplay revolves around the tycoon shop keeping segments and progress in it helps you advance the main plot. This segment is at a midpoint of an incremental game and a tycoon game you'd find in roblox. Where this game really shines though is in the side content. This part felt a lot like the Yakuza games where you'd wander around the world and stumble across npcs that can offer objectives or new mechanics. This side content really made the overall world feel solid and I found myself discovering new stuff in old zones far into the game. 

I also really enjoyed the story and characters. The dialogue was often witty and most npcs end up becoming relevant in later points in the game. You'd befriend a silly npc near the start of the game and they'd end up being important towards the end of the game with a new side mission or mechanic. The themes and messaging in the game was also nice and offered a hopeful end message.

Overall, I'd highly recommend this game. | Traigan el sopapo que le hago otra hija a la protagonista"

Ця гра мене захопила ще більше, ніж попередня, хоча є один великий мінус — не дуже пропрацьований сюжет, у попередній він був кращий. Я навіть трохи фейспалмнула на кінцівці.

Але все решта тут зроблено на рівень вище: різноманітний геймплей, додано більше активностей, багато класних деталей, красивіші локації (але шкода, що планет для дослідження було, по відчуттях, менше, хоча деякі значно більші, ніж у попередній грі). Також багато нових прикольних персонажів, але є й ті, що полюбились з першої частини. Бачимо еволюцію й у головного героя.

Мені дуже сподобались платформінг-челенджі, і загалом тут він складніше реалізований і цікавіший. Битви теж сподобались. Не сказала б, що гра дуже складна, попередню я пробігла взагалі на сторімоді, а тут на стандартній складності мені було ок — був челендж, але посильний і не фруструючий.

Щодо оптимізації, загалом могло б бути краще, але не критично. Ловила в ендгеймі якісь зовсім дрібні баги, які фіксились або медитацією, або перезапуском гри. Дуже рідко рандомно просідав FPS з 60 до 45, але мені це не заважало — грала на епіках без ретрейсінгу з 2060 Super.

Для мене Джеді стала якоюсь дуже комфортною грою, де просто приємно все досліджувати і робити скріншоти кожного знайденого куточка. Я зачистила всю карту на 100%, навіть те, що було необов'язково, наробила під сотню скріншотів за проходження (мій рекорд), просто тому, що подобалось знаходитись у цьому світі, особливо на фоні божевільної реальності, де щодня якісь жахливі новини та події, від яких їде дах. |  [h2] A great sequel overshadowed by performance issues [/h2]
It's such a shame cause beneath all the bugs, glitches and stuttering there's an amazing game with all the bells and whistles when it comes to the story, characters, atmosphere, soundtrack and gameplay.
Having only experienced the star wars universe through fallen order and now survivor, Cal's journey feels personal and epic, even without knowing the films. 
The story is much darker and longer in runtime with abundance of side content to get lost into, combat is faster and smoother with 5 stances to choose from this time around keeping it fresh! (blaster/dual wield are my go to).

But then I watched a video of someone playing it on YouTube and thought it looked much more fun than the promotional videos had shown. So I gave it a try and OMG, I totally enjoyed this game. It has no right to be as fun as it is. I tend to be a completionist and this game helped scratch that itch. The best part is that I'm a huge fan of Castlevania so that DLC was just the greatest thing I never knew I needed. Seriously, for me the Castlevania DLC made the game at least 10x more fun.

My only complaint would be it's kind of a one and done for me. Once everything is collected I don't feel a need to play it. Loved playing it that first time around though, collecting all the things, unlocking all the stuff, it was fantastic. I'd have to do a complete fresh install to relock everything to make unlocking it again enjoyable. But still, it was the best 190+ hours of my recent gaming life :D | This game has the best ratio between the amount of fun you'll have with the fewest amount of buttons. I've never played anything this deep with literally just WSAD and Space. Also, 5€ full price for this? What a bargain. I get that it's a simple game, but come on. Give yourselves some credit, devs. And thanks for the full ultrawide support, although I would prefer a third option to solid and transparent black bars, which would be no black bars, but that's a massive nitpick.

EDIT: Ooooooh! That's how they make money! They have DLCs, so the whole game is actually 20€ if you want everything. That makes way more sense. Still too cheap though, because from what I've tried from the DLCs so far, they are very good and definitely worth the asking price. | A lot of people like it but I honestly found it kind of boring. Just wander around automatically shooting stuff until you get overwhelmed, then repeat. It's fine but wasn't my kind of game. | Literalmente el juego del vicio a su máximo esplendor, el trailer habla por si solo, vas a dejar tu vida jugando a este juego para conseguir todos los desbloqueables y probar todas las combinaciones o personajes posibles.

El contenido que obtienes de juego por lo que pagas es totalmente justo, ya poseo todos los DLC hasta la fecha y realmente cada uno suma una cantidad de contenido absurdo que da para aun mas horas de juego.

Además, como fan de la saga Castlevania es muy divertido ir notando cada una de las referencias que guarda este juego y cuando añadieron el DLC de Castlevania, literalmente explote.
 | good mindless one hander to keep your adhd satisfied while you watch stuff, i also love how the Bible is the most powerful weapon in the game, like in real life, the enemies are charming and silly, the effects are incredible at higher levels, also love how the reaper comes in and gets you in the end everytime and theres nothing you can do about it, this is like a 2D cod zombies, i love games that just keep getting harder till it becomes impossible, no sense of accomplishment, just a straight waste of time, endless"

优点大家都说了很多，我来说说缺点：
1.结局或者说线路过于固定了，只能拜入武当，同样限定门派的武林群侠传，人家还有龙王线，东厂线等后续等不同的路线，有动力玩二周目甚至多周目，而本游线路就是固定的，最后当武林盟主，最后依据人物好感多几个结算画面
2.基于1有人说你那你可以走老路线，走老路线等于DLC的剧情就没了，为什么要少体验剧情呢？而且恶心的事，如果你不走一遍这个残缺的老路线，有些功法书和成就你还是没法解锁的，这个就很恶心
3.在DLC的补充下，前面的剧情丰满了点，但是后面赶工太明显了，白唯一死了以后没几步就天山决战了，天山那一大片地图基本就是过个主线就没剧情了，天机宫的往事完全还可以深挖，名剑山庄庄主明显对标的就是岳不群，拿女儿续命，各种算计，这个人物最后竟然就不提了还是挺可惜的
4.通关以后重新开档不能选立绘和角色样式有点可惜，比如主角和上官鸿最后的人物模型新开档不能直接选太可惜了，部分角色的立绘要是能在更新下就更好了
感觉还有很大的进步和优化空间，哪怕后续不设计出多线路玩法，后续剧情在丰富点还是挺不错的。
 | 剧情满分 吐槽一点有的剧情和支线不看攻略正常人一辈子都找不到 | What a nice and I would not afraid to say it is innovative game but jeez it is messy. You ever read any wuxia manhwa/manhua, they are also called murim works, well this is literaly them minus memes since it is very calssic and conservative with very righteous and benevolent characaters and it feels so natural in this setting and stunning art direction in a well executed 2,5D which just screams ancient China and you love it. A lot, and I mean a lot lot cultivation methods, techniques with different weapons, all of which are uniquely drawn and presented. And this all is just shoveled into your mouth without any filter or notice. 

Right of the bat you are given half of the map and you can go literaly everywhere, find dozens of NPC that you can rob through a friendly spar and get stronger by widening your meridians, as funny as it sounds this is what you would be doing majority of the game and you would enjoy it, but at some point there would be so much to do and remember that you would be overwhelmed and start missing content, dialogues or even quests that can hugely impact your story and gameplay. Nobody would warn you that there is some potential companion dies in random z-city because you simply never visited it or did so but at a wrong time. You would go through main quest just by going to sleep because it is written in the journal to do so, but by doing it you would miss most of the important bits that affect that same quest and rewards. 

I do know that there are games like Trails Series which change NPC dialogues after every cutscene but Wandering Sword is far and beyond that. I did enjoy the game, but I had to do so with guides which, tbh are far in between if you do not know Chinese, and I still missed a lot of things which nobody would warn you about. | 作为武侠迷逸剑的品质是真挺不错的 但是实在没法给出好评 前面的大支线以及南疆的剧情都写的非常不错 塑造的几个重点人物像燕未还和清霄都很好 
但是 天佛窟后面的剧情就跟坐了火箭一样快 伏龙子这种渲染了很久的角色被一掌拍死 大师兄啪的一下就黑化了 被宇文逸随意一脚踢飞后再啪的一下又洗白了 我是替肖寒光不值的（当然牢肖的角色塑造也很成问题）白惟一隐居的好好的又把别人拉出来送 那我南疆费尽心思做的完美结局不喂狗了吗 就像是为了捧叔叔这个天下第一 把其他正派反派全垫背了
女主更是重量级 烟尘回响改完主线后欧阳雪已经成为唯一一个戏份正常的女主了 从出场开始就把我是编剧钦点的这件事印在脸上  但是真感觉用力过猛了 戏份是足了但是动不动就退队一点陪伴感没有 江小彤则是开局出现了下然后直接隐身到最后结局 要知道找小彤可是宇文逸进入江湖的初衷 结果就开局提了下后面直接抛去脑后 想问问宇文逸对的起江大哥吗 瑶姬这边就是编剧想尽力往赵敏的方向写但是由于各种原因观感也就比小彤好那么一点 总体上三大女主是完全不如上官虹和✅❌❌的

提几个发自肺腑的建议吧：
手柄适配太太太垃圾了 我都怀疑作者有没有用手柄玩过自己的游戏 还有小屏幕的字体看了简直瞎眼 这游戏本来很适合steam deck玩
有几个队友可以直接删了或者做成支线 点名陈麟熙 孔亮 霍长青
现在的主线真不行 最好还是回到烟尘回响前大师兄当最终boss的主线

 | 可以说是我从小到大玩过的剧本上最扎实的武侠游戏，支线里雷家村、丐帮和一线天三大支线丰满且逻辑在线，主线上起步略平淡节奏有点慢，但渐入佳境、到南疆和天魔窟时我愿称我玩到过的最佳武侠游戏剧情，为了避免剧透只提一下师伯这个小角色，但却带给我特别大的感动，开始以为就是武侠里常见的固执老头比较脸谱化的角色，但故事发展到后面我完全改观可见创作者的用心程度不希望只是创造一个脸谱化的工具人。当然剧情上也有令人遗憾的点比如最后的收尾太草，但我更相信是开发成本的无奈之举。

优点夸完说说缺点，我认为战斗上缺点是比较明显的，武功上的搭配虽然有一定深度，但战斗时的快感确实还是缺乏了些，对于我们这种武侠遗老来说战旗或者回合从来不是问题，但本作战斗上还是欠缺体验的，小棋盘其实完全没现出来战旗的策略性，真的不如做成回合制，这方面我认为八方旅人的回合战斗可以是一个方向，还有就是在武打的动作上也有一点欠打磨，除了粒子特效外差了点动作感这点上神魔至尊传就特别值得学习，当然因为本作的价钱与成本这些都是完全可以原谅的点，只是希望下一作更精进。最后那种毫无意义的支线是真的希望下一作不要有了，真的很无聊且消耗精力，开头差一点被几个跑腿任务劝退"

This game is made in Unity, which means it overheats my computer. I don't think any point-and-click should ever be made with Unity. Opening and closing the game is sluggish, and I didn't enjoy the fact that I had to slowly turn the book pages every time I wanted to get to a later level.

[b]Little Cabin in the Woods[/b]
It was going really well until I got to the end when I became severely stuck and there were zero in-game hints about anything. Clicking the ""?"" was getting me nowhere, so I eventually caved and went looking for the walkthrough. Turns out there was an area on the screen that I was supposed to click that is incredibly difficult to spot because it blends right in with everything else ([spoiler]seriously, that gap in the wood looked exactly the same as all the other gaps, like there was nothing about it that drew my eye to that area[/spoiler]). Very rage-inducing end to an otherwise alright experience.

[b]Portrait of an Obsession[/b]
I think it’s pretty good for what you get, but I swear there had to be at least two instances of me clicking around and nothing happening, which incorrectly told me there’s nothing there or that the object doesn’t work there. But then these areas were clickable only after the puzzle is ready to complete, meaning I was very stumped for sections of the game in places I definitely wouldn’t have been otherwise.

[b]GrandMa's Delicious Cakes[/b]
On the short side, but hit the spot with puzzles. Only downside was that the game froze on several occasions.

[b]Rise of Pico[/b]
Somehow even shorter than the GrandMa one, but it managed to be very good on the puzzles. I will, however, complain that the background music for this one was so unbearable that I had to turn it off.

[b]The Left Behind[/b]
I liked most of it, but some of the puzzles were infuriating. I really disliked the physics one that required getting the balls through the hole, and I absolutely hated the one where you had to recreate the painting by rotating the tiles. On the latter, I  had to take a step back before I rage quit, and when I returned to it, the game glitched out and decided I solved the puzzle after a few futile rotations.

Overall, the feeling I'm left with is that of a chocolate chip and shit cookie. Very difficult to separate the two. But because I can only choose between a thumbs up or down, I'm going to be lenient with the thumbs up since I did technically manage to get through the game without needing the hints... technically. | 25.1.27：

ふと思ったんですが、カードゲームの「ー（長音）」は、ひらがなとカタカナで表記が違うのかなと思ったんですが、そもそもひらがなに長音表記は無いのでした。だからひらがなで書くと「かあどげえむ」となっちゃうんですね。何とも気が抜けた文字ですね。

さて、開発元のSokpopは、２０１７年から現在まで、かれこれ１００タイトルを超えるゲームをリリースして来ました。知りませんでした。それも翻訳が必要だと思う様なゲームには大体日本語が対応してますし、複雑で不便な日本語を忠実に再現出来ていて、このSokpopという方々は何者なんだと思いまして、ホームページを見に行きましたところ、メンバー最年長のtijmenさんがバク転してました。爽やかで結構。

そのゲームタイトルの中でも一番売れているというこのStacklandsは、見ての通りのカードゲームですが、食料の概念が有りまして、村人が増えれば出来る作業が増えるけれども、食料が足りなくなるので、食料生産の自動化をして、やってるうちに敵が攻めて来て、ハンマーやつるはしを剣と盾に持ち替えて、戦って、死んで、やったー食料が減らないから一人でいいや、何だっけこの宝箱、何だミミックか、よし全滅。というゲームです。

親切にクエストが組まれていて、最後までストレス無く変化に富んだサバイバル生活が楽しめるので、ライト勢にもオススメですし、かあどげえむ・ぼおどげえむが元々好きな方でもハマると思います。ブースターを剥く時のワクワクがここにあります。

Sokpopは他のゲームもワンアイデアが盛り込まれたちょっとイイじゃんっていう物が多い様に見えます。ホームページにPatreon.c0mへのリンクがデカデカと掲載されていましたので、飛んでみましたところ、４０００人以上の会員様がいらっしゃってこれだけで約６０００ドル／月という支援を受けており、その資金を使って更に毎月新しいゲームを開発して会員やSteamユーザーはニコニコ、開発者はバク転しているという好循環を生み出しています。

Unfortunately my review is negative because I tend to gather many resources, and the game becomes unmanageable when this happens, partially because the board size is smaller than the necessary, partially because new resources are not smartly grouped (they can be initially, but not for the long run). and then you start to focus more on the board management than the actual gameplay. My feeling is that the mechanic right now should be a beta version, and the true game should still be better polished before a true release. I do believe if the dev works in these improvements, the game may be a recommended one, but not right now. It`s also sad that the dev prioritized to launch new payable content than the basics of his/her game, which is a feedback for quite some time if you check some negative reviews | 还蛮有创意的卡牌经营游戏 唯二不足就是玩到后期卡牌堆满一屏幕有点看不过来，前期开怪出来会有点难打  但素真的很好玩！"

Великолепное переосмысление самой переоценённой игры в истории, отправляется в список моих любимых рогаликов. Я в шоке от глубины проработки и как из такого простого концепта можно выжать столько игровых механик, которые генерируют столько неожиданных геймплейных ситуаций. Потенциал билдов более чем раскрыт, тащить можно чем угодно. Меты как таковой нету, бóльшая часть перков так или иначе полезная, так что всё в ваших руках и на высоких рангах майндгейм зашкаливает. Справедливости ради, чаще всего вас банально будут зажимать фигуры, потому что ходят они по несколько штук за один ход. Да сложно, да рандом душит порой, но тем не менее затягивает. Дал поиграть деду, он кончил. А у него уже лет 30 не стоит... Говорит о многом.

Из минусов хотел бы отметить дизбаланс прогрессии а также невозможность пропуска выбора. Тобишь, чёрные карты почти всегда уступают белым и ты регулярно обязан выбирать между двумя плохими наборами. Имбовые чёрные карты тоже есть, но на мой взгляд маловато элементарных стат-апов на фоне полутора десятка белых карт, которые откровенно руинят забег если ты их подбираешь. Чего только стоят Таймер, Хилящие офицеры, Стреляющие короли и Кошмарные Кони. Ну или игра наролит кучу фигур на доске и вдруг оказывается что оружие ниxepa не способно вынести прущий навстречу легион. Особенно это всё ощущается на высоких рангах, которые надо проходить молитвами нaxyй. 

[code]Стоит отметить, что игра довольно короткая и забег в среднем проходит за 7-15 минут, так что слив не столь фрустрирует как в каких-нибудь комплексных рогаликах, где по полчаса трайхардить приходится.[/code] 

Учитывая что игру относительно часто обновляют, жду когда добавят больше карт на урон, патроны и уменьшение разброса. И почините наконец эту хрень когда убиваешь фигуру позади которой стояла другая и тебя ваншотит перманентно. Что самое интересное, если убить преграждающую фигуру гранатой то ваншот не прокнет, но я вам этого не говорил... | It was a great fun game with levels that get a little bit harder, and you can get different shotguns and after each round you pick a card that upgrades your side, and the enemy. The normal amount of turns in a round is maybe 20-30, and 9 rounds in the level and i think 8 levels. There is also endless and chase.
 | This game is a very fun strategy and roguelike game, i love the variety of cards for you and the enemy and the achievements have kept me playing for a bit now, definitely worth it for the price but would pick it up on a sale like I did. | This is exactly my kind of silliness. Shotgun King is a chess game except you only have your king left and he has a shotgun. If that makes you think ""Wait a minute, that's not chess at all!"" then you would be correct. The game only wears its chess influence only on the surface, the game actually is a turn-based strategy roguelike. You have to play through 12 rounds and defeat the final boss at the end. Each round your goal is to kill the white king. You can do this by firing your shotgun, each white piece have different amount of HP, pawns and knights have the lowest and the king has the most. Your shotgun has three main stats: firepower, range and firing arc. Firepower defines how many pellets your shotgun fires, each pellet dealing exactly one damage. Multiple pellets can hit the same target, can hit multiple targets or completely miss any target. There is some RNG involved here but the closer you stand to your target, the more likely you are to hit it. Range shows the maximum travel range of your pellets. Your firing arc shows the spread of your pellets, they will always be inside this arc. Shooting an enemy that stands directly before you will always make all pellets hit him. It's the same concept as in other shooting games, the shotgun is more powerful close range and loses its power the further you stand away. However, sometimes a wider spread might be beneficial to hit more pieces. There are some strategic decisions you can make here.
Shooting or moving will always pass your turn. White pieces will move on their turn and they can move multiple pieces at the same time. They have their own speed stat that defines how many turns they have to wait until they can move.
Moving will also reload your shotgun. This is important, so you can move outside of check and fire on your next turn.
Your shotgun has only limited ammo, which does regenerate but very slowly, so you don't want to kill every piece, you want to focus on the king but still deal with troublesome pieces.

After each floor you will come in contact with the roguelike mechanic of the game, the cards. You get a selection of two different black cards which help you for the rest of the run. These can be simple like more firepower, ammo or range but they also can give you completely new abilites like a melee attack that does not use ammo or grenades, that will hit multiple pieces but can also kill you.
Each black card is tied to a white card. These are upgrades for the white side. They can get more pieces, change how pieces move and give pieces more HP or speed. You will have to evaluate what upgrades you need but also what downsides you can endure in return. One white card that always appears is the white queen after floor 3. You can't escape her, she is everywhere.
Killing a non-pawn piece will give you an edge however. You get their ""soul"" which you can activate to move in the same pattern as the piece you killed. You can only store one soul but you can get black cards that allow you to store more or have some other synergy with it. These soul cards are best used to get out of check or close the distance to the white king.

The game is incredibly goofy with its concept but its also a challenging strategy game that will take you some time to master. And as you beat th egame, you will start to unlock new difficulty levels that add extra pieces at the start, improve the enemy AI and give the white king more HP. You can also unlock new shotguns that have different starting stats. There is a surprising amount of variety in this small game. The game still gets updates to this day, despite being almost three years old. It's funny, it's challening and it's the exact type of game to play at the evening after a long work day. | Fun game, nice and easy but with just the right amount of strategy involved."

[i]Depuis des années, Rusty Lake s’est imposé comme un studio incontournable dans l’univers du point-and-click narratif. Avec leur style unique mêlant énigmes, surréalisme et storytelling mystérieux, leurs jeux plongent les joueurs dans un univers fascinant où chaque détail compte. Underground Blossom s’inscrit dans cette lignée en proposant une aventure introspective au sein d’un métro énigmatique où chaque station représente une étape de la vie de Laura Vanderboom, personnage emblématique de la saga. Entre puzzles ingénieux, ambiance oppressante et narration fragmentée, le jeu parvient-il à renouveler la formule tout en restant fidèle à l’identité du studio ?[/i]

[h1]Voyage ferroviaire à travers la mémoire[/h1]
Dès les premières minutes, le jeu séduit par son concept original : un voyage à travers différentes stations de métro, chacune symbolisant un moment clé de la vie de Laura Vanderboom. Cette idée, à la fois simple et puissante, permet au joueur de découvrir l’histoire par fragments, en assemblant petit à petit les pièces du puzzle narratif.  

Chaque station propose une ambiance spécifique, avec une palette de couleurs et des éléments visuels qui évoquent un souvenir précis. On y retrouve les thèmes chers à Rusty Lake, notamment la mémoire, le temps qui passe et la fatalité du destin. L’univers du jeu, toujours empreint de ce surréalisme propre au studio, joue sur le décalage entre des scènes de la vie quotidienne et des éléments étranges, voire inquiétants. Cette atmosphère est renforcée par une direction artistique minimaliste mais expressive, où chaque détail semble chargé de sens.  

[h1]Un gameplay intuitif[/h1]
Comme dans les autres jeux de Rusty Lake, le gameplay repose sur un système de point-and-click parfaitement intuitif. Le joueur interagit avec son environnement pour résoudre des énigmes variées, allant de combinaisons logiques à des mécanismes plus abstraits nécessitant une bonne observation et une réflexion latérale. Les puzzles sont bien intégrés à la narration, et aucun ne semble artificiellement ajouté pour rallonger la durée de vie.  

Ce qui distingue ce titre des précédents jeux du studio, c’est son rythme fluide. Chaque station représente un niveau relativement court, ce qui permet de maintenir un bon équilibre entre réflexion et progression narrative. Les joueurs novices apprécieront la difficulté modérée des énigmes, tandis que les habitués des jeux Rusty Lake y retrouveront la satisfaction d’un univers où chaque élément a une signification cachée.  

[h1]Cryptique mais captivant[/h1]
L’un des grands attraits du jeu est son approche narrative fragmentée. Le jeu ne livre pas son histoire de manière linéaire, mais pousse le joueur à reconstruire les événements à travers les indices disséminés dans chaque station. Laura Vanderboom, personnage récurrent de l’univers Rusty Lake, se dévoile peu à peu, et les éléments de son passé prennent un sens à mesure que l’on progresse.  

Cette narration éclatée s’inscrit parfaitement dans l’esthétique du studio, qui joue avec les souvenirs, les rêves et la symbolique pour créer une expérience immersive et introspective. Les dialogues sont rares mais percutants, et chaque station apporte son lot de révélations tout en laissant planer des mystères. C’est cette ambiguïté, ce refus de tout expliquer clairement, qui rend l’expérience si fascinante.  

Les thèmes abordés, comme la perte, le regret et la quête d’identité, donnent une dimension émotionnelle forte au jeu. Rusty Lake parvient une fois de plus à troubler le joueur, en le plongeant dans une ambiance où le familier devient inquiétant, et où chaque détail semble receler une vérité cachée.  

[h1]Une DA envoûtante[/h1]
Visuellement, Underground Blossom reste fidèle au style du studio, avec des dessins simples mais expressifs, un travail minutieux sur les couleurs et une mise en scène soignée. Chaque station possède son identité propre, et la progression à travers ces différents lieux donne l’impression de feuilleter un album de souvenirs. L’ambiance sonore joue également un rôle crucial dans l’immersion. Les musiques, à la fois discrètes et envoûtantes, accentuent le sentiment de mystère et d’étrangeté.

[h1]Quelques défauts mineurs[/h1]
Si Underground Blossom est une réussite sur de nombreux aspects, il n’est pas exempt de petits défauts. Sa durée de vie, d’environ deux à trois heures, peut sembler courte pour certains joueurs, surtout ceux qui espéraient une aventure plus dense. Cependant, cette concision évite les longueurs et garantit une expérience intense du début à la fin.  

De plus, bien que l’histoire soit captivante, elle reste cryptique et pourra frustrer les joueurs en quête de réponses claires. Rusty Lake laisse souvent planer des zones d’ombre, préférant suggérer plutôt qu’expliquer. Si cet aspect est l’une des forces du studio, il peut aussi laisser une sensation d’inachevé pour ceux qui aiment les récits plus explicites.  

Enfin, la rejouabilité est relativement limitée. Une fois les énigmes résolues, il n’y a pas vraiment d’incitation à recommencer l’aventure, si ce n’est pour mieux comprendre certains éléments de l’intrigue ou découvrir des détails subtils passés inaperçus lors du premier passage.  

📎 Rusty Lake signe ici une nouvelle réussite en proposant une expérience immersive, poétique et troublante. Son concept ingénieux, son gameplay fluide et sa narration fragmentée en font un voyage captivant à travers la mémoire et le temps. Bien que sa durée de vie courte et son récit cryptique puissent frustrer certains joueurs, il n’en reste pas moins une œuvre marquante, qui parvient à toucher et intriguer.

Que l’on soit un habitué des jeux Rusty Lake ou un novice curieux de découvrir cet univers singulier, Underground Blossom offre un moment hors du temps, où chaque station de métro devient une escale dans l’âme humaine. Une expérience à ne pas manquer pour les amateurs de mystères et d’énigmes à la fois poétiques et dérangeantes.

Ich habe das Spiel sehr genossen. Zum Teil sehr verrückte Rätsel.

Die Story lässt sich gut durchspielen. Um alle Erfolge zu erhalten, musste ich allerdings Guides zurate ziehen. 

Tolles Spiel empfehlenswert! | Once again I am in something of a quandary.  Steam insists on this 'all or none' approach to ratings and recommendations.  I wouldn't rate this as a 5, although it certainly held up for a considerable time as being a genuine prospect for 5 stars.  I played all of the Rusty Lake games in the order recommended by the developers (posted in the Cube Escape Collection Discussion).  I found the first 2/3 of the games to be engaging and challenging.  Things seemed to go pear shaped at around the Paradox stage.  I have a personal issue with that particular game because I was thwarted in playing early on because I could not complete the 'bug killing' challenge with the globe because of my arthritis. Despite several posts and emails to the developers I failed to get any response to a workaround or alternative so that I could complete the game.  That isn't what changed my view of the overall series though.  Things seemed to depart from the thread that was originally established around the White Door stage and continued on from there.  The whole rigmarole of having to jump to Discord, external web sites and social media platforms did nothing to enhance the game play and left me nonplussed.  The Samsara Room was underwhelming, the Past Within suddenly required you to have a playing partner as it was designed as a coop game - again with no apparent workaround and finally Underground Blossom seem to fall flat for me as it was nowhere near as challenging as the first 2/3 of the games.  Bottom line - if you can buy them all bundled (I got all of the games for about $20) I would say it's a good deal.  But it does seem to lose it's way and start to run out of gas (and ideas) as time wears on.  I'd give it a 3 1/2 - 4. | Another game from Rusty Lake universe. This time puzzles were less creepy and also easier (except the usual extra achievements, that are just damn hard - unless you check the Lake's community). We learn more about one of the characters that previously was mostly mysterious. So... in general for fans of the series. If you will play it separately, might be a bit weird

76561198041304371,2161700,Persona 3 Reload,0.0,"Adventure, RPG, Strategy",0,"A good Persona game, although I find it lacking compared to P4G and P5R.
The added $35 expansion also irritating me.
 It's like... P4G has a better story/plot and characters, and P5R has better combat/gameplay/personas, as well as the best characters in the franchise.
I still enjoyed P3R, but damn.. I wish I would have started the Persona series with this one, I may have liked it more if it was my first entry into the franchise.

My experience with the Persona series in order from P4G, then P5R and finally P3R is comparable to eating a delicious prime cut medium rare steak, then eating some delicious cajun spiced king crab legs, ...and then eating a hamburger..
Like yeah, a hamburger is good and all, but it ain't no king crab legs. Feel me? | First of all, I want to say that this is an absolutely beautiful game!  After 641 hours, I have finally mastered it, unlocked all achievements.  I feel a great sense of accomplishment in being able to complete this challenging task.  Needless to say, this game is highly recommended by me.  I consider myself to be somewhat of an expert on Persona games.  I have played them all and they are all wonderful.  I actually played Persona 3 a long time ago when it was released on PS 2 but I don't really remember that much.  As for Persona 3 Reload, I can't think of anything negative to say about it.  The story and dialogue are very endearing and captivating.  I had to play through the main game 3 times because I messed up on getting all the social links the second time.  However, I did watch and read through everything.  The individual social link scenarios in this game are especially interesting.  And also, in addition to the main social links, you also have the link episodes with a few of the other characters on your team, who do not have social links.  You do these several times in order to unlock additional personas.  Also, if you engage in other activities with your characters, you find that you can get a deeper understanding of their backstory and upgrade the character's Theurgy and characteristics.  This was a nice touch and really added to the overall development of the plot.  A good portion of the playtime in this game is spent fighting battles in Tartarus.  The battle system is similar to the other Persona games.  However, in this one, you can't talk to the enemies.  You acquire personas by winning their cards in the shuffle or by fusing.  I have a completed persona compendium.  There are a few top personas that I think are the best.  For a long time, I was using only Masakado.  Then I started using Messiah when I got that.  Orpheus Telos was the last one I got and that one is also good.  The first time you play the game though, you obviously don't have these high level personas.  I was playing on the normal difficulty level and I didn't really have any trouble with the fighting.  As long as you fight all the enemies you encounter, you gain sufficient levels.  The battles are fun in this game and battle music is good.  I also like the fact that it shows you the enemies info, weaknesses and what skills they have.  This is very helpful.  There are also the requests from Elizabeth.  I have been able to complete all the requests except for the last one.  As of right now, I don't know if I can beat her.  I only tried a few times so maybe I will try again.  The requests are kind of like a side quest that don't you don't really have to do.  There are a few that will unlock personas though and I like to be as thorough as possible so I did them.  Anyway, for me, the most fun and at the same time challenging aspect of the game was trying to get all the social links.  As I said before, the second time I played the game, I messed up and I was about 5 days short, which was very depressing.  I have a very detailed spreadsheet that I wrote out what I did every day and I could see where I made my mistake but by then it was too late to fix so I had to play the whole game all over again.  I am very happy that I was able to play this game and I want to thank the developers for making it.  It's very addictive and once you start, you just want to play and not do anything else.  Even after being tired from working 8 hours every day, it gives me something to look forward to at night and on the weekends.  I hope they continue making more Persona games in the future.  I have heard rumors about a possible Persona 6 but nothing confirmed.  Please, please, please, let there be a Persona 6.  I have bought multiple copies of other Persona games and I will keep playing them and showing my support.  I'm done with Persona 3 for now.  In case you didn't know, there is also anime based on the game.  It's split into 4 parts, or 4 movies.  I watched that also.  I thought it was nice to watch because, even though in the game the main character is silent, they didn't make him like that in the movies.  He actually does have a personality and a name, which I did use when I played, the name I mean.  So, if you like Persona and Shin Megami Tensei games like me but you haven't played Persona 3 yet, give it a try.  My file is currently showing 641 hours but I may go back and do a few more things later.  I just got that Metaphor game so I'm going to play that, also by Atlus.  Bought it a few days ago.  I haven't tried it yet but it looks good.  I feel like a wrote a lot but didn't say very much.  I just love Persona. | 枯燥的爬塔或是不合理的社群，太多太多想说的话，在最后闭上眼响起キミの記憶时都释然了。 | 太有生活了p系列，虽然爬塔是粪坑蝶泳，但吃过屎之后的糖才更甜，这百来小时下来到结局真的太不舍了，P系列玩了绝对不亏 | Смерть - это навсегда. Этого не изменить, можно только принять. 

Persona 3 - самая мрачная и самая серьезная часть современной 3D трилогии в серии Persona. Мало какой игре удается взять в оборот такие темы как ""смерть"", ""расставание"" и ""утрата"", и сделать не банальную edgy духоту, а очень жизнеутверждающую историю. Историю, после прочтения которой несомненно становится грустно, но все же вместе с этим и хочется смотреть в будущее с высоко поднятой головой. Историю после которой неиронично хочется жить. Эпилог и финальные несколько сцен - это настоящий нарративный и визуальный шедевр. (Внимание, дальше спойлеры) [spoiler]Так на моей памяти смерть главного героя еще никто не изображал. Последние встречи с друзьями выглядят, как настоящее прощание - многие из них прямым текстом говорят, что ""всегда будут помнить"" его, да и сам герой рефлексирует о том, что успел сделать. Вместо дешевого шок-фактора (типа ""Бум! ГГ убили!"") сделали очень эмоциональную сцену.[/spoiler] 

Ремейк Персоны 3 по-настоящему вывел её на новый пьедестал. И дело даже не только в обновленном визуале (хоте он сам по себе тоже очень крутой), а скорее в количестве добавленного и переработанного контента: наследственные проблемы со старыми переводами наконец-то поправили, качество озвучки улучшили, добавили новые сцены с мужскими напарниками, расширили и перебалансировали боевку, обновили систему слияния персон. Короче говоря, получилась самая настоящая переделка от А до Я, которая не только сделала Персону 3 гораздо лучше, но и наконец-то причесала и привела в порядок всю эту неразбериху с разными изданиями на разных платформах.

Всем рекомендую."

Absoluter Teambuilding-Blockbuster, der ohne Kommunikation quasi nicht machbar ist: sprecht miteinander. Die Level sind fair gestaltet und teilweise richtig anspruchsvoll in der Gruppe zu meistern.

Had a blast, 10/10 | [h1] Друзья или их отсутствие [/h1]
В общем игра довольно хороша, я мог бы начать сравнивать с первой частью, но увы я в нее не играл.
[h2] Геймплей [/h2]
Данный платформер строится на взаимопомощи группы людей (группы друзей например).
Как пример вы должны построить лестницу из всех людей и кто-то один из них должен забраться по ней и взять ключ.
Игра занимательная и веселая (Но все зависит от напарников).
[h2] Стоимость и проблемы [/h2]
Данная игра стоит 5,79$ по CIS, что я считаю дорого для платформера такого рода.
Я считаю что для комфортную игры в данный платформер требуется 5-6 человек или более, и не каждая компания друзей себе может позволить, чтобы каждый из них заплатил такую сумму за игру максимум на часов 10.
Но радует одно, то что можно заходить к друзьям с одного устройства как 2, 3 или более человек.
Это работает по принципу локальной игры: первый играет на WASD, другой на стрелочках, третий на нумпаде при его наличии. Данная фича может сэкономить спокойно друзьям, живущим неподалеку долларов 10 а то и более. (Вы будете играть как 3 разных человека, просто компьютер общий и управление странное)
 Если же вы не счастливый обладатель большого количества друзей, то есть функция общих лобби, но есть одно НО. Там совсем нету людей, самое большое количество которое я собирал было 2-3 человека.
[h2] Вывод [/h2]
Если вы счастливый обладатель 4-8 друзей, которые живут неподалеку и/или могут купить данную игру, то смело советую, так как концепция и реализация на высоте!

約3時間のボリュームの中で多彩なパズルが出てきてすごく楽しかった！ | 小而美的解谜游戏，非常推荐喜欢解密和密室逃脱的玩家游玩！
游戏把内容分割成了表游戏和里游戏（游戏里的游戏）两个层次，在狭小但信息量满满的表游戏房间探索，然后在里游戏里冒险并通过表里世界相结合实现解谜。例如在里游戏，玩家需要操控一个浮板达到上层来拿到道具，可是里游戏只有下左右三个按钮，而上按钮在表游戏的桌子上，这时候你就需要从游戏桌前起身去操控表游戏的上按钮来完成解谜。就这样简单的循环，每打通一个世界会解锁meta元素的过渡解谜，比如有一关你的纹路长腿跑掉并消失，你需要把纹路找回来。游戏全程不长，但是刚好能够时刻维持着新鲜感，能够从头到尾都保持极高的正向反馈，虽短但每一关设计的都很精巧。美中不足是boss战设计较为拖沓，对色弱玩家非常不友好（对着青色的密码按了半天蓝色烦恼了很久为什么不对）。

76561198041304371,2659900,Sixty Four,4.3,"Casual, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",9,"This game needs to be even more clear that is barely anything more than a Clicker game, but not one you can leave alone.  It highlights the texting-based story, but has about as much plot as Cookie Clicker.  Also easy to miss, as they come randomly about 20 minutes apart.  Not sure who it's for, as the automation takes a while to get to but the complexity build-up or the setup is not at all rewarding.  Machines locked until further progress are not visible in any way, have no indicator of when you can get them or what you're working/waiting for, giving no sense or clue of progress or development while you can't really leave it running, as machines have to be refilled every few minutes.  No chance of an autoclicker program either, as you click each 'automation' machine to refill them.

Like others have said, this is a Clicker game that won't do anything after a brief break in your presence and interaction in the game. | Love the gameplay. Unique blend of incremental and automation. 

HATE the ""dialogue"". Adds nothing to game and is poorly written. | On sale for 3 dollars US?? Easily worth it.

Biggest Downside? As the game progresses, resource generation becomes more punishing. Wish I had known that I would need read the wiki to get to a stable infinite gameplay spot. And that if I couldn't I'd need to restart my progression from the midgame. Probably won't finish the game because of that. 

I loved exploring the efficiencies, it just too punishing for testing out builds in the endgame to continue to be fun.

7/10 | doesn't feel rewarding or incentive to play.
The beginning is very grindy with almost no automation, and every early mistake can be quite punishing | I really wanted to like this game. I've spent the time to understand the mechanics, experiment with layouts, and optimize. But it was a one-sided effort, with the game feeling mostly frustrating and not rewarding. 

The main issue for me is the pacing. The game is a strange mix of a Factorio-like production optimization—but without proper automation, until [i]much[/i] later in the game—and an idle clicker—but still requiring attention and user input ever couple of minutes to refill the machines). With the addition of the (simulated) time passage when the game is closed, it feels like one of those microtransaction-filled mobile games, only someone removed the ""pay to not wait"" and ""pay to improve resource storage"" microtransactions and didn't replace them with anything. So I spend hours refilling machines and saving up for the next small—but prohibitively expensive—purchase.

The last nail in the coffin for me happened when [spoiler]I've reached Chromalit and got to a point where I even need to time when the resources are released, just to be able to do anything with them (since storage is way too expensive),[/spoiler] the whole experience became a total chore—with no end in sight—and I just wasn't enjoying myself."
