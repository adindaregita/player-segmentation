76561198428416976,1,N/A,Recommended,"So far it's been really good, fan of the story and a big fan of Invasions and how that's going to evolve season to season, this game has hooked me on fighting games and makes me want to commit and get properly good at them eventually. My only main issues so far: -Ermac and Quan-Chi are in the Kombat Pass, despite already being in the main Story as fightable and complete enemies so I don't get why we have to wait for them??? -Abrupt 30FPS cutscenes and transitions, it's not major but it can be jarring going from half the smoothness and I don't understand why it gets locked, especially when there's an unofficial patch to remove the 30FPS lock and nothing wrong seems to happen. Denuvo also likely doesn't help with inconvenient stutters (please remove it, it was bad for Tekken and it's bad for MK too). -Shrine system is kinda ehh but at least you get koins at a fair rate and it's not the worst system ever. -Customisation is not very clear and there's not any menu or board where you can look at goals for outfits and cosmetics to unlock like Injustice, would be nice to have. One last thing, when you add Crossplay, for the love of god don't leave PC out of the matchmaking pool. I beg.",89.3 hrs on record																					(26.0 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198428416976,1,N/A,Recommended,"I never thought a Lord of the Rings game with very brutal Batman: Arkham combat would be so amazingly satisfying to play. This was really entertaining to play through, and it runs really well on my system. The nemesis system is quite unique and feels like you can actually build your own army against other Orc's. Graphically this game still holds up extremely well, at times looking better than a good amount of games coming out right now, and the art direction is especially a main factor, the orcs and world all blends together really nicely and the models are highly detailed. Also the sound design for this game is so good, when you drop onto an enemy from a height, it feels like you can hear their bones just being crushed and all the sword slashes hit really hard, voice acting as well is quite good and everyone does a good job. I think my only issues with this game, is that the slave side missions can get a bit repetitive although they're at least different in how you can do them and how most of them play, pre-rendered cutscenes + them being locked to 30FPS is quite jarring because they look worse than the game and don't match the colours at all so it's quite jarring of a change especially when they're sudden and frequent, and the game crashing a decent amount of times (although that was likely on my end and my overclock not liking this game).",20.4 hrs on record																					(17.7 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198428416976,1,N/A,Recommended,"It takes some mods to get working to today's standards but yeah, it's a good playthrough. It can get a bit repetitive after a while, and Juno's relationship with Starkiller feels really forced to me, but Sam Witner's performance is still good with what he's given. If you can take 10 minutes to get this game to run at 60FPS and add a physics fix file, then you'll likely enjoy this. I remember playing this on the PSP back in the day so this was a nice trip down memory lane for me. Also the boss battles, some of them are not fun, and I will never understand the dev's wanting Euphoria as the physics engine when you end up just ragdolling during fights and you can't do anything but tank hits or die. The endings are pretty good, you can kill Palpatine and let him somehow return later, or go for Vader for a bad ending which is really grim. You get crushed with a ship, then metal armour gets grafted to your flesh and vocals it's really dark when you think about how painful that is. Sam Witner's shout if you choose that ending shows how good he is, and why he's so good as Darth Maul in the shows.",8.6 hrs on record																					(7.6 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198428416976,1,N/A,Recommended,"Crash Counter: 20 This game is absolutely incredible, but the PC port is so bad it just is even more miserable to play than it normally is. I wouldn't recommend this right now, but once it gets fixed, I'll update this review. In 2 hours of gameplay (88 minutes of playtime was spent just building the shader cache alone), I've experienced 1 crash, a LOT of drops below 60FPS often hovering around 40FPS on a mix of medium-high settings at the recommended specs and I'm also playing with DLSS on so I don't dare imagine what it runs like without that crutch. The patch that came out today as of 29th of March has improved things a bit, and I'm glad they're updating this quickly because I can't be bothered waiting so long for the actual version to come out.

76561198428416976,1,N/A,Recommended,"Whilst this is an exceptional remake, and extremely loved, it pains me that I can't recommend it right now. The amount of CPU and stuttering related issues no matter your specs, very likely caused by the awful band-aid fix; Denuvo Anti Theft. Why developers choose to use this awful 'fix' I don't understand... The game just runs awfully and becomes a stuttery mess at times because of it, so I can't say you should buy this right now until either a mod fix releases, or EA is nice enough to remove it.",3.2 hrs on record,N/A

76561198428416976,1,N/A,Recommended,"I didn't really get hooked into this game like I did with the first one. I sunk hundreds of hours into the first game on Xbox when it came out and came back for each DLC, especially The Following and the free content updates. The gameplay and movement felt really fluid, and the game was legit scary at night, and you felt like a superhero when you levelled up and got each skill. Dying Light 2 from what I did play, and watch feels like an upgrade in some areas, and a downgrade in a lot of others for ME, which is really sad because I was really excited for this one. Stuff like climbing and parkour does not feel nearly as satisfying as the first game which was a turnoff as that was a big portion of the game, and the same with enemies, especially with the dumb healthbar trend games seem to be following now. It feels like a mobile game, or just not even close to the original if you put them side by side at a glance. The graphics and performance are also kinda ehhh. In some areas they can be really good, but in others pretty bad. Maybe I'll come back to this game in the future, but if you're expecting stuff to be nearly as satisfying and cool as the first game, I really wouldn't recommend it, it's a shame.",11.3 hrs on record																					(1.1 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198428416976,1,N/A,Recommended,"Decent game, improved gameplay and features upon the first especially the graphical improvement. The story though is really confusing if you're not paying 100% attention with the school flashbacks. Speaking of which, they really ruined the flow of gameplay a lot. The amount of 1-Hit kill enemies was especially annoying, and the respawns are put right next to said enemy so it's just a matter of you dying until you finally escape. Blake's voice actor is decent although the constant swearing didn't seem needed when you see something scary, as it takes away the player's reaction. The final scene though was great... Blake is trying to cope with the fact his wife has just died, he has gone completely insane and is left alone with a 'child' that isn't there. Overall, decent game with some innovation which was welcomed but the flow of gameplay and story needs to be improved for the upcoming game.",14.0 hrs on record																					(5.1 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198428416976,2,N/A,Recommended,"Aside from a few apparent bugs that never got fixed (in my case, beat the game on Hard but got no achievement, beat it on Old School but did get that achievement so it looks dumb) like some cutscenes fast forwarding like the parking garage or assets not loading in cutscenes properly, this game is amazing. The gunplay and gameplay is basically what makes the game and it's ridiculously fun and replayable. The hunt for the golden gun collectables is a nice thing to do on the side that doesn't take away from missions because usually they are in plain sight and a glance away although sometimes it might take a minute to get to them or fully search a place before moving on. Whilst it is annoying that cutscenes are mostly unskippable, it's not the worst and they usually aren't too long and you get thrown right back into shooting people anyway.

This is no doubt because they cut so many areas, fights etc. out of the game. I was at one point able to beat the game three times in the same day. 2) The Final Nemesis Boss Fight on Nightmare and Inferno. It is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

76561198428416976,2,N/A,Recommended,"A great and simplistic program that can really ease people into animation and art once they've gotten to grips with the controls, although it takes a lot of effort to throw yourself in due to a lack of proper tutorials that properly explain things. The Steam Workshop and other sites are great for getting assets, although they are very keyword specific so be careful if you don't immediately find what you're looking for. The render tech still holds up pretty well, and you can make some damn impressive posters even to this day with the right lighting and models, and with a bit of touching up with something like Photoshop. Seen a lot of friends and artists create some really good stuff that would make you not think it's the Source engine at first but rather something else, although you really have to be picky about settings and stuff. My only complaints would be, the fact that this is based on an older version of the Source engine and has not seen an update in years (it's not happening). And the crashing / performance issues that come with it can be a challenge, especially when you're just looking through your asset lists to pick something to add to your scene. It can be extremely painful. Out of the time I got with this program (now moving on to Blender because it's a lot more higher quality and the opportunities that come with it are great), I managed to make some neat posters and mess around with things I didn't think I would. It's really good for just messing around and learning different things about 3D art.  In conclusion, if you're getting into 3D art, and you don't know where to start, I'd definitely recommend using SFM as a go to just to see what it's about for starters because it still holds up pretty well. Just remember to CTRL + S extremely regularly.",195.9 hrs on record																					(157.1 hrs at review time),N/A

76561199013703711,1,N/A,Recommended,"When I got this game, I was very hesitant. I've never played a Paradox game before, or even just a in-depth strategy game like this before. At first it was so complicated looking to me that I was considering just getting a refund, but a couple friends said I should play a little more before making conclusions. So I looked up some basic videos on how to play as the German Reich efficiently, and now it is one of my most played games, and probably even on my top 10 list. Now I have also moved to playing some games with my cousins, who I introduced to it as well(they aren't usually into strategy based games either) and we had some great fun and continue to play the game today. Another one of my favorite things about HOI4 is that it has Steam Workshop support. So if the base-game gets boring, there is always the Great War mod or the Modern Day Mod you can try out. So I would say wait for a sale, buy the Cadet Edition, and give it a shot. Even invite a friend if you want.",753.1 hrs on record																					(93.8 hrs at review time),N/A
