,76561198009353718,1.0,HELLDIVERS™ 2,Recommended,"having the warbonds in the game is fine, but when adjusting difficulty upwards all the time you suddently need better weapons to proceed and then i dont feel like its enough to go around on easy difficulty getting these premium currencies. getting the first weapon with armor pen is on like page 7, probably 20 hours of gameplay. we want to continue above difficulty 7. i did buy the demo pack and did enjoy it, my friend did not and is suffering heavily of not having armor pen. its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pay to win.

,76561198009353718,1.0,Schedule I,Recommended,"the early parts of this game is really fun, getting upgrades and everything. later the game becomes a shelf restacking simulator/run for deals and you feel really level capped. the automation in this game is crap its way to manual, you cannot really run multiple joints without to much interferance.",26.7 hrs on record,N/A

Ive been searching a school and searching the toilets Just to progress There is a lot of enemies doing routines, making it a standard Stealth game time to time.

,76561198009353718,1.0,The Invincible,Recommended,"Love how the game unfolds its story, lovely graphics and scenery. The length of the game is perfect, reminds me of firewatch where you always have radio contact with a person som it doesnt feel so Lonely walking around in the empty world.

,76561198009353718,2.0,Outlast,Recommended,"Love the linearity of the game, the game usually only makes you look for 2 items in search areas, only one time you have to look for 3.

Cons: -enemies stay close to your hideout, sometimes its just better to run past the enemies. -search areas for small items -game is old Pros: -jumpscares -linearity -game looks good because of the dark scenery -not that long game(4.6h) -interesting story -controls are easy",10.2 hrs on record																					(4.6 hrs at review time),N/A
,76561198009353718,2.0,DAVE THE DIVER,Recommended,"Dave is pretty much an advanced phone game, runs very nice on the steamdeck, i played it mostly while traveling since it doesnt use very much battery. after completing the game my resturant was automatic with me managing the wasabi and fish and farm, i continued to skip all days so i could see if there was anything good for christmas or new year. its not. Cons -Chineese cartoon style - the game flashes you a whole lot with a really bright screen, when i first saw it i couldnt stop being annoyed with it -it gets tedious -not very much to spend money on, when you have the diver gear the only thing to spend  money on later is the workers at the resturant. pros -good mobile game, played a lot when on work trip - fun - a lot of new game mechanics, would like them to be introduced earlier",31.1 hrs on record,N/A

,76561198975545285,7.0,N/A,Recommended,"Once again I stress this issue of where in a time where representation is more important than ever before, the lack of LGBT representation in popular media, including video games, is striking. While LGBT representation has come a long way over the years, there is still a long way to go before all members of the LGBT community are represented and included in popular culture. One of the most anticipated video games of the year, Elden Ring, is a recent example of this lack of representation. Here's why Elden Ring needs LGBT representation: 1. Representation matters: Representation is crucial to making all members of society feel accepted and valued. Without representation, members of the LGBT community may feel invisible, ostracized, and left out. It is important for media, including video games, to include diverse characters and stories that reflect the experiences of all members of society. 2. The power of video games: Video games are a particularly powerful medium for representation, as they allow players to experience the world through the eyes of a character. This can provide a unique opportunity for players to gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for the experiences of others. By including LGBT characters and stories in the game, Elden Ring would be providing players with the opportunity to learn about and empathize with the LGBT community. 3. Missed opportunity: Elden Ring is a highly anticipated game that has already made a big impact on the gaming industry. By failing to include LGBT representation, the game is missing an opportunity to make a positive impact on the gaming community and to promote inclusion and diversity. Including LGBT characters and stories would not only make the game more inclusive, but it would also demonstrate that the developers are committed to creating a game that is welcoming to all players. 4. The potential impact: Including LGBT representation in Elden Ring has the potential to make a meaningful impact on the gaming community. As one of the most anticipated games of the year, Elden Ring has already captured the attention of millions of gamers. By including LGBT representation, the game would be sending a message to gamers that the LGBT community is welcome and included in the gaming community. In conclusion, Elden Ring needs LGBT representation. Representation is crucial to making all members of society feel accepted and valued, and the lack of representation in popular media, including video games, is striking. By including LGBT characters and stories, Elden Ring would be providing players with the opportunity to learn about and empathize with the LGBT community, and it would also demonstrate that the developers are committed to creating a game that is welcoming to all",133.9 hrs on record																					(1.9 hrs at review time),N/A

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide. After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side. Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay. After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as. Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends. I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together. Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that. Thank you.",45.7 hrs on record																					(13.9 hrs at review time),N/A

This game is fantastic, beautiful, social commentary about social media and reconnecting with each other when we need it most. It has an addictive gameplay loop. The story/lore is deep, interesting, and wholly unique. It's one of the few games where I don't skip the cutscenes because of how enthralled I am in the world and story. The performances from the actors is phenomenal. The art style reminds me a lot of the works of Junji Ito/Lovecraft.

Just having a kick whenever you need instead of switching weapons is a great tool in many situations and you start to appreciate kicking. The guns have nice models and great animations. The models themselves are really good. The game play is really fun and smooth. Its awesome to play the bad guy! My favorite part had to be escorting the target, something about good and bad both not wanting to cooperate with each other but having to in order to escape death was cool to me. Not to mention the Epistle 3 references. It's worth your time especially since it's free. If It gets some recognition by valve that'd be awesome as it really deserves it!",11.7 hrs on record,N/A
,76561198084163272,1.0,Hidden Deep,Recommended,"I found this game through Barotrauma, another game I'd recommend if you have friends to play it with. Anyways, Hidden Deep is really fascinating and comprehensive. Some things could probably be made a little more streamlined and/or tweaked entirely but overall its a great game! Dying isn't exactly a bad thing and the ways you'll die will either make you laugh or just freak you out. My favorite enemy is the worm thing, it's just fun to have one slink outta a hole and start chomping on your brain or try to. Not to mention your character will rag doll violently and realistically sometimes and that adds a lot to the game by itself. Alongside the rag doll and barotrauma, the player and the environment have that vibe and style that I can get behind since it makes it extremely easy on the eyes with nothing really 3D. I really think this game is worth some amount of your time because it's kinda addicting to explore and be work through puzzles that don't feel like puzzles but odd outer space mining work. My one real issue is I've soft-locked myself at least twice with the vehicles getting stuck and or upside down, just make an option for vehicles to reset like you can kill yourself and I think that fix the only issue I've had. For real, give this game a go!",4.1 hrs on record,N/A
,76561198084163272,1.0,Fallout: New Vegas,Recommended,"This game is probably the best fallout PURELY because of its choices and features not present in 3 that were taken and adapted into 4. This is probably the only fallout where you'll have a moral dilemma decided who to side with instead of the good brotherhood or evil faction. Sadly there is a bunch of cut content for this game that will never see the light of day, however there are a few mods that restore some content cut late in development like uncut wasteland or the great mod that is playable post game. I love this game dearly and when i want to play a fallout i think of 4 and its horrible dialogue  and writing and New Vegas pops up to fill satisfy me until we get another decent fallout game.",114.4 hrs on record																					(84.7 hrs at review time),N/A

Like the previous Max Payne's you get to listen to this depressed man's inner monologues and watch his life fall apart continuously and it's beautiful to watch and play. Watching some of your victims flop off edges is still so much fun. Not to mention the soundtrack in this one is stellar and really gets your blood pumping to shoot some low down mercenaries!

It's so in depth that you can do one thing at the beginning of the game just to have some misc. npc mention it and the end!

,76561198227299476,1.0,Max Payne 3,Recommended,"This game used to be fine before when I have purchased it. It asked 1-2 times for activation code and worked like a charm. Recently, I came back to this game and it was playable like usual (1st attempt). Then suddenly, when I play back the game for 2nd time, it asked for an activation code (again!!) and give this ""Error Contacting Authentication Server"" bull of crap and wouldn't just let me play the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. At the moment, I'm still waiting for the ""actual"" response from the Rockstar Support to fix this bullcrap. This is why I despise so much about DRM and beware to the new buyers. Edit: In case, anyone can try this method to fix the issue: 1) On your internet connection adapter, change the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) as following: 8.8.8.8 (Preferred DNS server), 8.8.4.4 (Alternate DNS server) 2) Change Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) as following under the DNS server: 2001:4860:4860::8888 (Preferred DNS server) and 2001:4860:4860::8844 (Alternate DNS server). 3) Click OK and try to run the game again.

,76561198227299476,1.0,FINAL FANTASY® XIII,Recommended,"A tough and difficult review for this entry. I will do my utmost to make it concise yet informative. 1) Features: Graphic still looks awesome for current trend, music even though no longer composed by Nobuo Uematsu, it still holds up on its own accord though some of them are not really on my preferences, but some really do like the Gran Pulse main theme. Additionally, SEA region version only receives Japanese audio as compared with ROW versions. This is a big letdown to me, as I like to keep on switching language in different palythrough. 2) Gameplay: Battle system somehow quite similar with Chrono Chross yet active input is required without pause setting for ATB gauge to filled up. Might took some time to familiarised with this new system for established FF fans, yet it is an interesting system once you get to used it. Different strategic tactics can be applied, though I'm not really keen with this system. Customisation of equipments and accessories, and levelling up via crystarium are nicely implemented and deter players to keep on mindless grinding. However battle rating could be implemented better, not focusing too much on time and damage applied, and not really into the ""doom"" imposed if you are to be involved in a battle for a longer time. 3) Story: be prepared to keep on hearing these famous words; fal'Cie, l'Cie. Caccoon, Pulse, Focus, etc. Storyline is filled with interesting mythology but quite poorly implemented on my humble opinion. Direction is quite linear, but hang in there as reaching to chapter 11 will improve your experience better (for FF veterans). 4) Replay value: Quite high, considering many equipments require expensive catalysts and many gill (game currency) required. Second playthrough might change the experience drastically. 5) Optimisation: Slight poorly optimised, several drop in FPS experienced in several area such as in Gran Pulse, glitch in datalog text (enemy descriptions) apart from 1280x720 resolution. Audio is too low and unadjustable. Limited customisation on keyboard binding capabilities. Esc and Steam home keys sometimes unresponsive. Apart from that, cutscene and graphic as stated earlier, are looking great. What I really like about this game: Graphic and FMVs, certain music, development of certain characters, certain implementation on the paradigm, mythology of the game What I really dislike of this game: Quite linear storyline with less to nill interaction with npcs, most informations could be given indirectly instead of relying in conversation and datalog methods (especially mythology of the game), paradigm shifting/transitions could be better. Finally, I really dislike this game in SEA region is only restricted in Japanese audio as compared with ROW version. Neutral: Difficulty spike, action in combat, system concerning upgrading accessories and weapons. Final remarks: I would like to give this a neutral since halfway of the game, since I forced myself playing this game on numerous occasions until I reached out at chapter 11. Nevertheless, this game is good, but not that bad either. So its a yes from me. FF veterans might not favour this game, but I do encourage them to try and hold on until reaching to the Gran Pulse area. I would like to replay this game from scratch with different language, as in certain language, voice actors may perfoms differently compared with the original voice actors. This might yield different personification of certain characters.
