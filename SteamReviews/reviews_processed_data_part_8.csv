76561197964099717,8,N/A,Recommended,"Ghost Signal is played over a 3D HUD-map that you can freely control. If you zoom out, you don't usually need to turn it around at all. Gameplay consists of plotting your movements for your ship and deciding when to fire, what to fire and with what weapons + when to boost. A combination of active gameplay and strategy. Plotting a route slows time, so you get better time to plan your next move. You gain resources and find various upgrades and often need to decide which ones to pick or upgrade. You essentially make up a build during the run and decide what to upgrade and what to sell. After your run ends, you keep experience that you use to gain various permanent buffs and unlocks = roguelite-aspect. You also keep unlocking new ships that vary quite a bit from each other. The ships also have their own unique roguelite-research trees. ---- +Works nicely in VR +Roguelike+roguelite-mechanics +Player choice +Skill plays a clear role +Aesthetics are cool -Zooming camera out for a better overview in combat is bit of an annoyance as you often need to hold up a button to slow time (plot a movement), having a default option for further camera would be neat",4.6 hrs on record																					(1.4 hrs at review time),N/A

76561197964099717,9,N/A,Recommended,"I liked CoH 1+2 and I am enjoying CoH 3. Been playing it only during the free weekend. This review is purely coming from the campaign perspective. The campaign map is bit clunky; it takes quite a bit of time for AI to take his turns due to animations being so slow and units moving even though you don't see them in the fog of war. Still, it's a nice upgrade from not having it, since it gives the player much more control on how to achieve goals and in what order. Upgrades feel meaningful and the conflict feels larger as every unit on campaign map is actually a regiment of units that all gain skill points separately that you then get to throw on plethora of options. In short you either unlock new units (for real-time battles), unlock or improve new skills for the real-time battle, improve some general perks on the campaign map or flat out upgrade the units in the real-time mode. My only real issue is that the campaign turned very easy as soon as I noticed that the solution to real-time fights is to simply rush points deep and stop the AI from capturing pretty much anything. I ...have a feeling the multiplayer will be the same, but without the AI playing poorly. 😅 However, there's some nice variance in missions so the same doesn't apply for e.g. ""use limited units to destroy targets"" or ""survive""-kind of objectives. It feels bit like a complex real-time version of rock-paper-scissors, but at the same time ranges and line of sight plays vision too...and obviously you can pause it at any time too. An infantry heavy machine gun is nested in a building? -> that's job for either a sniper, some mortars / howitzers or some armored vehicles that cannot take any real damage from the machine gun fire. A heavy tank incoming? -> anti armor cannons, bazookas, satchel charges, sticky bombs or heavy enough tanks. The game is about having correct units at correct positions at the correct time, which to me reminds warfare. CoH manages to turn all this to a neat and complex enough real-time strategy game where strategy truly matters. It feels like breakthroughs, correctly timed retreats and various ""tricks and gimmicks"" play a nice role that's more together than the sum would let you understand. Edit: 2nd free weekend on 8th of March, 2025. I did continue the campaign for few hours, but simply got bored eventually and uninstalled the game. I'm sure the game is best enjoyed (for an extended period of time) as multiplayer, but their pay to win (for advantage) approach is pretty lame indeed. While (some/all) of the companies might be unlockable with in-game currency, you've the option to just do the same with premium currency.",10.1 hrs on record,N/A

76561197964099717,10,N/A,Recommended,"+ It's turn based... + It has emergent gameplay elements - The game starts in Chinese language with intro that has multiple stages of written text and you cannot skip them - After the intro you will start a tutorial - in Chinese - with forced menus that close your settings / ESC-menu constantly - The settings menu is in Chinese and it's hard to find if there's an option for changing the language to English (yes there is, under the second top-most (?) option that has resolution; one of those settings is the language) - English translations are terrible; you literally can't understand what the various sigils (passive buffs) actually do - You miss the tutorial, but the gameplay doesn't seem too difficult, but the general UX/UI design is very poor, eg. I accidentally recruited a character when I attempted to find out what the other characters are now that I could hire one. At the same time I have no idea if I spent some resources to do that or not ...and at the same time the characters show a upwards scrolling arrow icon on the bottom left part of their portrait. On the top menu I can see I have some orbs for leveling my characters up, but I have no idea how to use them. Opening the character menus doesn't solve the issue. Instead there's a talent tree of two paths that seems to use some other fragments. = the game explains it's mechanism terribly poorly.

After picking one, your first tutorial thingie starts (not sure if it was 1 out of 3 options you pick or what the tutorial icons were on the menu), but anyways - your first actual gameplay action is to BAN ""something"" out of ""something"". There are five teams / trainers on your opposing side and they have 4 ...perks? Cards? Units?

It's lane based autobattler combined with constant progression mechanics. Your deck is most certainly better the following day that it is today due to the early reward mechanics. You will build a deck of 30 cards with max two copies of the same card, excluding legendaries that you can have one copy of. The cards are either units or spells. Majority of your deck will always consist of units. You have three lanes and can summon your units in the first three squares on any of these. You don't have any mana but instead the cards have cooldown timer. Every turn every single card on your hand will get -1 turn on the cooldown and when it's 0, you can play the card. You don't have to though. Your maximum hand size is 6. On turn 16 on you will draw two cards and from turn 31 fatigue mechanic kicks in. I've never seen a game past turn 20. +Great mechanics; cooldown mechanic instead of mana is fantastic not to mention the plethora of keywords and tons of different units +There's constantly something to do -> plenty of ways to improve your collection -Dev. is in full Chinese mode and has flooded these reviews with fake reviews; this isn't one of them. EDIT (at the time of uninstall):  You will play mostly against bots; bots that soon ridiculously over level your cards - opponent having +2-3 level legendaries, +3-4 level epics and +4-5 level commons is just ridiculous and ruins the experience -> this is the pay-/grindwall. -The game doesn't tell you where your units would move / how far they can reach -> you'll just have to learn that melee range is 1-2 and ranged units have +X attack range that's past that and that units will always attempt to stay at max range -Very pay to win, however you can enjoy the game for tens of hours without feeling it -Horrible UX/UI experience; some menus close from left corner ""back""; some from ""X"" on right side; changing resolution automatically closes the game  - including if you choose the resolution you already have chosen -> full-screen doesn't work for me at all (there isn't an option for it but in the in-game chat some people say alt+enter works for them; not me) - Horrible UX/UI experience #2: There's also gazillion different menus and resources in very ""Korean"" mobile game way -I would have supported the dev. by purchasing the $0,99 ""first purchase"", but I cannot even get any UI open to do that -> it just attempts to load something on the screen, that won't appear -Timed chest mechanics are always meh and utterly mobile -Your double time chest mechanic timer keeps running while you are away from the game even if you aren't opening a chest -> rewards for few hours of that is just pointless -Some lousy translation / typos even ...yet I STILL do consider the game mechanics are proper.

76561197964099717,20,N/A,Recommended,"Would leave neutral, but since that isn't available - I am not going to recommend the game (for myself). Think Slay the Spire with numerous twists. There are major issues with the game: 1) Hero/class based unlocks are behind STORY-mode, which isn't the same as ""new game"" = ""normal game"". To unlock STORY mode for a character, you'll have to clear a NORMAL run with said character first. Now these normal runs have additional cards per character which the player is supposed to pick some customization options for the NORMAL runs. However, the cards are LOCKED behind the STORY mode or the ROGUELIKE-mode (called Dragon ...something. Since you cannot start the game with STORY mode, the ""most efficient way"" of playing is to start with ROGUELIKE mode, which is the deepest end for a new player. The deepest end wouldn't be really even an issue, but as you'll quickly have 50+ traits (think passive effects) at the same time on your hero with 20+ effects on at the same time, the amount of mixed synergies is just ridiculous. This probably wouldn't be a problem alone, BUT it is, since: A) The UX/UI can't show more than a dozen effects DESCRIPTIONS on the character at the same time. The extra ones are drawn off-screen or only partially drawn - this is on a 4k res. display. B) The game has RUNE mechanic in which you manipulate cards in various ways during the run, which has a poor UX/UI experience. For example you won't be able to see effects like ""banished"" or ""barred"" that RUNES might add to the cards when previewing a possible card to ""runed"". Everything turns clunky and slow if you want to play well, which isn't fun. When you combine the muddled RUNED cards to gazillion traits - and the fact that the game has so much control over cards, you'll easily play 20+ cards per turn or even infinite combos when you reach them.

At the same time there are serious balance issues that lead to heavy snowballing. Necrons can reanimate some of their dead units (remnants).

TL;DR: To me the game just wasn't good / fun enough, although I absolutely love roguelikes. -- The premise is really interesting. 2D action based roguelike where you complete various missions in mothership derelicts. The mission always ends in a destroying the core of the ship that ends the mission. + Great combat + Great SFXs + Great VO + Handles / plays well / no hickups or stutters of anykind ---- Downsides are that the game is a constant race against a clock and the various ""mothership systems"" that enable the derelict various defensive features as long as those are alive. The problem lies in the constant hindering of the player that just doesn't really feel ...fun. Playing the game feels like untangling a tight knot. You can do it, but I personally don't get a kick out of it. - There are SHUFFLE systems that shuffle the location of every mothership system every minute or so - There are REPAIR systems that repair systems over time after they've been destroyed - There are SHIELD systems that prevent damage completely until they are destroyed - There are ALARM systems that rush various enemies to the area, forcing you to spend some time with those - There are NUCLEAR systems that explode a massive AoE that tend to prevent you from passing it for the while it grows and lingers - There are various FACTORIES that keep generating different sized enemies from drones to juggernauts - There are DOOR systems that unlock all locked doors that normally require consumable keys to open - There are FLAK systems that enable unkillable turrets on the outer hull of the ship with homing ammo - There are HAZARD systems that enable mines and various other hazards, like moving blades, plasma thrusts etc ...and possibly the worst of them all: - There are JAMMERS that prevent setting waypoints and prevent you for seeing the ship blueprint, which essentially force you to first scout the ship to see routes if there are shufle systems on-board --- If only the game had more focus on a feel-good progress, instead of hindering player on every possible turn. The new tech that you salvage/unlock from the ships are essentially against your main goals. Even if you get them, the campaign progresses.

Now due to free weekend, thought I'd give it a go, as I've enjoyed previous Fallouts. It's been a VERY positive surprise. It turned to be a FO4 with more livelier world as there are other players roaming around. I play the game solo and don't really see how the multiplayer aspect turns anything more enjoyable in the party. Fallout's core loop is about looting and progressing. With shared loot, you'd hinder yourself, but I suppose the extra pair of hands in fire fights will balance that a bit. Sure, it has same bugs than FO4 (eg. you'll be stuck running in power armor while attempting to enter another power armor) and the UX/UI isn't really ideal for inventory management. Still, the game is now added to my wishlist and I'll be picking it up when it falls under 20€. Why under 20€? Just because there's too many games on my backlog. It's worth the full ask price in it's current status. While it has the microtransactions, presence of those haven't ruined the experience for me at all. I do not pay for microtransactions myself. I like the perk system better than eg. FO4 in which you just turned to a god with everything unlocked. Here you need to choose how you build your character, yet you can change it on the fly anyway you like. You just cannot be everything at the same time. Sure, it leads to some idiotic scenarios where you eg. change your ""bartering skills"" on before you trade and other similar hassle, eg. equipping a pistol when you move so you get the running speed boost (while you've a pistol equipped). Still, it kinda adds a layer of skill based control and I still enjoy it. The only real downside I would say is the inventory management which is still a pain. I guess it always will be as you've easily hundreds of different items and components. I think some color coding would help, or adding eg. filters that would allow you to ""by default hide junk, holos, data"" etc items on the lists but keep the rest. Or just having FOOD, DRINKS, DRUGS on their specific tabs / having option for that. The AID list turns infernally long. One thing I do not understand at all is that certain vendors simply pay you better for same items than others. To maximize profits (as you certainly could use a LOT more caps than you have), you're then encouraged to sell everything on ""one of the good vendors"".

Here's my reply to him: Thanks for the reply. Did not expect that to be honest. The least I can do is turn off the joke-mode and start explaining myself further here. Let's start that I don't actually know if you're german, the game just felt like something developed by an engineer with very little knowledge of UX/UI and the perspective of a FRESH player coming to the game. Let's start from the main issue = ALL tutorialization should be in the game; rules and complexity should be added step by step. Player should NOT NEED TO reference to any external documents, videos or material outside of the game. They're playing a game to enjoy and entertain themselves so the game should make sure they're catered. All the information the player COULD be thinking at this point should be available for them and clearly visible. Highlighted, paused as needed etc. As an example of a game with fantastic tutorialization, while keeping the game enjoyable and clear - try Slay the Spire. What was my experience with your game? The game starts with one of eight campaign options. Why would I pick one of these? Why isn't there a tutorial one teaching me? Instead I can choose any of the eight. Okay. I pick the leftmost, human - I think. Let's even presume it doesn't matter what I choose. It's simply a character class / race decision, like it would be eg. in Diablo 3 / HoMM3. Doesn't change the gameplay experience for the first time player. After all, the player doesn't know what he can encounter anyways. After choosing the campaign, you get few tiny popups in the middle of the screen with nothing blurred out from the background. Hard to read. Is this important? After the tiny popups, you're thrown to a some sort of character lobby. Why am I here? What am I doing here? What am I supposed to do here? I've money to buy something. So I choose an unit from the bottom five units. No idea what those are at this point. My units? Maybe? No idea. After all I do not know what the game is about even. At that point I am informed that only *heroes can equip items but that units should have potions with them.* Oookay. Browsing through the tabs and I find out that my left most character is a hero. I am being told on a text box that some items are available only for certain classes etc. These text boxes aren't great way to teach player anything. I decide to purchase my hero with 1h axe, shield and a cloak. So I buy them. They're now listed as *owned*. ...yet I am not informed what am I supposed to do with them. Should I even buy them? I have zero gold and as I am trying to leave, I'm being informed that ""you would still have room in your party"" (or something similar). Err, okay? How could I know that? How would I know if I should purchase an unit or an item? Nothing? As an extra annoying cherry on the top, even the tooltips are timed and not instant. I am seeing values, but I haven't been thought how these values work. +1 defence. What? Hit chance reduction? Where are my stats? Armor mitigation? Extra hit point, an armor point that refreshes per turn? No explanation. I have no idea what it does and the game doesn't tell me that. Instead the game should teach all of these naturally as the game progresses WITHOUT player being forced to error and trial. That's the worst kind of game design. I started the game and a map draws with ~10+ targets. What? Why? What is going on? So I choose one. Combat starts. Why? Okay, my hero doesn't have the items I just bought him. ""Cool, just what I wanted to do."" Spend my gold on items and then ...leave them somewhere? Items tab is empty. Fine. Let's see how the gameplay is. Okay. I can see my hero has ""segmented move"", meaning I can move twice to angle myself. But... why would I need to do that? After all the game hasn't thought to me that I couldn't move one pixel at the time if I wanted to? Or that I couldn't set waypoints while moving normally? Or that the game is turn based and not real time? Or that units have no AI and will mindlessly go on straightest line to the movement position? Well, let's try the combat. Okay, ranged units have two circles. Yellow and red. Wonder what these are? Not indicated anywhere. Minimum range? Maximum range? Optimal range and maximum range? Who knows... Cool. Skeletons have 1 hit point. One of them has ""projectile resistance"" or some simlar trait. Okay, I can shoot the other one. ""10% chance"" vs 60% (or something similar) on another unit, non skeleton likely. Okay, nothing was explained again. Why's that? Both units seem to have defence values but these do not explain these numbers either. How are these formed? So I clear the combat - and next combat notice that none of my guys healed from the damage they took. I have no idea should I press on or do something else... which was the point I decided to uninstall the game. Hope you (and other readers of this review) see what I am on here. There are players whom are interested and willing to LEARN a game. I certainly don't. Game is supposed to teach itself and the rules it has to me WITHOUT error and trial and utter confusion. --- Here's a neat article on how harmful error & trial is to a game: https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ThomasGrip/20100412/87102/Why_Trial_and_Error_will_Doom_Games.php --- PLEASE NOTICE THAT I AM NOT LOOKING ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS! Answering to my questions that I had here doesn't help anyone. Spend the time honing the game in a way that IF a player has those questions like I did WHILE playing the game for the first time, they're finding their questions satisfied. These were all rhetorical questions that game designer should keep asking themselves while they dev. the game. Does my game answer to these (and many more?) in an entertaining way while the player plays the game? That means no text walls. With a plethora of games out that I do enjoy, I am not spending time with something I don't enjoy one bit. ...and this is coming from someone who eg. loves roguelikes, (eg. ADOM, Angband, Nethack etc.), DCGs, 4Xs/strategy and so on.

Couple years back Faeria existed as a web browser game, but out of the blue it disappeared for good couple years. But alas! Now Faeria is back with a new, smooth Steam early access client. And damn it's good! What's different in Faeria compared to other major digital card games: Permanent mana. No reset between turns. Players gain 3 mana per turn. Units are placed in a hex grid, which is empty at the start of the game, except the four faeria (mana) nodes Players control the map by summoning either two neutral lands OR one land of the four elements that act as thresholds for cards (neutral cards do not need any, but are weaker stat wise) Units can only be cast on land you own. If the creature (structures can be built anywhere) requires certain element, it has to be cast on a hex where the corresponding land type matches Positioning matters on the hex grid. Line of sight: Ranged attacks are blocked by friendlies (no ff, but you cannot shoot through them). Movement: Flying creatures can move on any tiles. Movement: Aquatic creatures can move on tiles that have no element (considered sea) OR lake (one of the four elements) cast on them. 30 card deck with 3 copies, 1 if legendary. What's similar to others: 1vs1 obviously Permanent damage (no healing between turns) Summoning sickness on creatures and structures 20 health on players - win condition is to reduce this to 0. Milling doesn't seem to exist in the core set. --- Upsides Aesthetics. Looks and sounds great! Depth & complexity in gameplay mechanics and deck building Rewarding is pretty decent (10 wins per booster) + daily quests Players can pay 49,99€ for all the cards (x3) in the core set if they so choose Downsides No filters in deck builder Minor UI/UX annoyance: Players cannot see the buffs/debuffs/effects that are cast on the cards. Just the current numeral stats and default text. Minor UI/UX annoyance: When deck has 30 cards, players cannot see card rarities on collection any longer. The rarity icon is replaced by a lock. Balance issues: One turn finisher decks are what people seem to go for. To be blunt, it's damn boring. Control seems quite hindered. You'll like Faeria over Hearthstone if: You're looking for more depth/complexity You're looking for a more skill involved game Faeria and SolForge are the two card games that are actually worth playing online.

76561197964099717,37,N/A,Recommended,"I've played a lot of Master of Orion 1 and 2. Third was an absolute travesty, damned space Excel. The new Master of Orion under WG shows promise, yet understand that it's in early access for a reason. I'm eventually writing a preview of Master of Orion for Gamereactor Finland and thought I'd share the issues I've encountered while stabbing at it. Some of these are plain feedback. Some are bugs, some are not. Some are minor, some are more severe. Some are calls for features. TL;DR: Great potential, tons of issues. Early access material. Main issue really is how easy the AI is to play against -> it's not fun when there's no challenge. Here's a list of fixes I'd suggest, should give you an idea where the game is at. EMPIRE SCREEN ........................... Population redistribution is not available as it should. Add it. Population on strike does not show correctly on 1920x1200 resolution when player has 10 or more population on strike. Only first digit is shown. UPGRADING SHIPS .............................. Should be doable with production too, not only currency Confusing and bugged. I'm often seeing upgrade option to blueprint I don't even have any longer but no options for ones I do // Yes, correct ship size GALAXY MAP ..................... Star lane transit direction is very hard to see. Adding an arrow wouldn't hurt. Player color is not shown when you zoom out. Military Bases are very hard to separate. Eg. as Bulrathi, opponent military bases still have the red outline circle (same color/hue as your nation color. There's only a microscopically small area on the military base (requires you to zoom in), which is colored per player unique color. Ideally the military bases would look different from race to race. Add a glow effect to fleets that have actions/movement left. Combining fleets is bugging / acting weird sometimes happens automatically, sometimes you have 4 fleets in same spot, not able to combine them (I've had like 3-1-1-1 ships with movement left) Can't build military base on a system I'm on for some reason. I've one there, can't build another. Add a more visible effect for planets with moons. Add auto bombardment option. Cycling around for multiple fleets to manually bombard is an unnecessary burden. If a ship could finish an action after movement, the game should allow resolving that before ending a turn. eg. unloading / attacking. If you're using automatic movement, you'll lose a turn currently. Players should be able to drag & drop ships from selected ships/fleets. Civilizian / Combat ships should be more clearly distingushed from each other. eg. different background glow / icon size? COLONY SCREEN ............................ Add multiple worker redistribution. Currently you will have to move them one at time. Pollution tooltip / overlay isn't giving enough information. Pollution reduction buildings are confusing. Pollution change % does not update when you start production for pollution removal. You need to move a colonist first. Science/Food/Production values aren't always upgraded correctly with eg. heightened intelligence causing +0.5 science/population. Adding a population to science adds +3 total science, but shows +2 science on the planet. The values should calculate the bonuses too. Hard to find out when a planet is ""wrong gravity"" or radiated. It should have a large info screen right away Manage buildings"" is useless with the 3D planet that you'll have to turn around to locate a building you'd want to scrap. Add a 2D list option at least. Area where the colonists can be activated to move them from an assignment to another is is very small. It should made much larger. SCIENCE SCREEN ............................. Breakthroughs are confusing. Apparently you do not have to choose a tech if you get one? Or this could be a bug that there's some tech that was marked as split | option, but yet I got both. Clarify. Tech that is non-cumulative should also show gained net effect, not only the ""compared of having no previous tech"". FLEET SCREEN ......................... Shows player ships, but doesn't allow players to do anything Suggestion: Fleets could lower the command point cost of the ships in them when certain requirements are met. The amount would be tech dependant. Suggestion: Fleets could have a slot for a flagship , which would gain some sort of offensive/defensive/command point buff. This way players would also have more personal attachment to their ships and fleets. DIPLOMACY ................... A.I. races tend to throw same offers to players, which just feels ...not right. Suddenly in one turn, 4 races want to offer you whole 90 credits for a certain tech, oookay. Exchange tech should show tooltip for what the tech is. Not only the name. COLONIZING .................... Too cheap / becomes bothersome when players aren't penaltized anyhow from having colonies. Ideally you'd just colonize every single planet, starting from the better ones. Easy quick fix would be to eg. triple colony ship production cost. No colony bases in same system available? COMBAT .............. Often starts with opponent's military base/missile base/star base showing explosion GFX // graphical glitch Missiles/torpedos and kiting just stupidly powerful. Balancing required. A.I seems to take over player ships, even when you disable the AI. Add an option for permanent weapon range overlay Add a retreat option. Proton torpedoes do not always show any GFX Add scrolling combat text options, eg. ""50% damage dealt"" on side when 50% of the weapons miss. Ideally even with reason ""beam defence"", ""ECM"" Add turn based combat as option. That way you don't have to explain all the work made on the real-time one to publishers/investors. It's there, but you want even more! SHIP DESIGN ...................... Proton torpedo description says they move light speed and hit instantly, but in combat they're very slow (as they should be) Description screen isn't always showing all the text and is scrollable, but does not show any kind of scrollable area, even when there's enough space to show all of the description Military power value tells absolutely nothing. It's confusing. Attack and defensive values <-> military value all pointless and confusing. Instead add various damage/DPS numbers. eg. missile salvo damage. Armor and armor penetration is confusing System / weapon descriptions are terrible. There are tons of modules that show NO effect only random description. eg. dauntless missile system Weapon modules should be technology linked. Weird that players have all the available options right away, eg ""enveloping"" before you even know what shields are... Weapon modules (eg. heavy mount) show no effect on any of the values but size/production cost Allow players to add too much stuff on the ship and change screens. Just prevent them from building an ""illegal"" ship. Highlight pausing of combat somehow. Pause is the hotkey, perhaps add a large ""pause"" button on the middle bottom with binded hotkey shown? MUSIC ............ While the current music is quality production, why 100% classical instruments? I'd love to hear tracks with electronic elements too. *points to Master of Orion 2 OST ...and Civilizations: Beyond Earth!* Racial tracks would be great as well!",21.7 hrs on record																					(13.2 hrs at review time),N/A

I've played the game DAILY since January 2014 on iOS, when the deck customization was implemented to the game. SolForge is one of the two actually proper digital card games around for the people looking for depth in mechanics. The other would be Battle Decks, not Hearthstone, but let's not go there now... -30 card deck -Draw 5 cards on each turn -Start with rank 1 (tech level in game) -Played card gets a leveled up version to your discard pile -Each rank consists 4 turns for each player -Discard pile and the rest of the draw deck gets shuffled when new rank (tech level) begins -Based on actual effects and combinations, instead of flat out power/health of the cards -Most of the cards are capped to rank 3, but these are few that have rank 4 as well (not necessarely better) The table consists 5 lanes. Creatures attack the players, which both have 100 health at the start. The goal is obviously to get that to zero. If there's a creature at the opposing lane, the damage is exchanged. The damage is permanent and not healed on turns. The reward mechanic is VERY fair for a F2P game. There are no premium only -cards. 1) You get a booster (or better) reward as daily login and silver worth around ~333% of a booster. 2) From a first daily win, you get a draft ticket worth 4 boosters. 3) From a third win, you get a similar reward as daily login - booster (or better) and silver worth ~33% of a booster. 4) Each win also gives you 250 silver, which is 5% of a booster price. 5) With 3 draft tickets, you get to enter a draft where you KEEP the 30 cards you draft. On top of that, you play 4 matches and get better rewards depending on how you succeed. Minimum reward is 4 boosters on top of the 30 drafted cards, which eg. include all the legendary cards in the game. The only real downside is that the legendaries from the past few sets have been power creeped. Legendaries used to be very situational, but the fact that there are now quite a few lengedaries that work. I suggest you play the game on iPad. That works wonderfully.

Uninstalled the game. Changed positive review to negative for obvious reasons. I'll check where the game sits in a year or so. Review from 2015: This is essentially what Mechwarrior Online should have been. A skill based, tactical shooter with various roles. It still has ""enough twitch""-aspect so the player skill plays a major role. A single skilled player can somewhat dominate the game as there aren't many ""instant hit"" weapons that you couldn't avoid with proper movement and positioning. The few lasers in the game are pretty limited in effective range. Some of the weapons also have firing arcs, which means that if you aren't positioned well, you might be only to fire eg. one out of four main weapons. +Looks and specially SOUNDS suberb +Not just a hitscan shooter, moving plays a HUGE role. Plenty of weapons that will require timing. +Extremely playable, controls are silky smooth and responsive as you get hang of the intertia and mass of your ship +Different ships and builds REALLY impact gameplay +Although team based, a single player skill matters MUCH more than in a typical MOBA +Although there is currently just one map, I think the asteroids are procedially generated, meaning gameplay changes a lot from round to round +Avg. game lasts only 15-20 minutes -No real leaver penalty yet (this isn't really that much of a problem as people can join games that have already started) -Armor mechanics aren't properly explained (damage multiplies if you break armor)",130.0 hrs on record																					(128.5 hrs at review time),N/A

It's still great, until you reach the end game and start dying in ""one shot""-kind mentality (or generally in split second). I personally don't find the experience enjoyable and I don't think that it fits ARPGs. It makes no sense to me that you can build your character very tanky (eg. 7kish HP, maxed resists and other defensive layers (immortal call) and that the content can be very smooth and easy until something spikes and you die instantly. I've seen what the game offers now and will return next time in Path of Exile 2.

I've been actively playing since C64s, for past 8 years worked as a freelancer gaming journalist and during the 25 years of gaming, I can count the games that reach the sheer fun and quality that Path of Exile does with my fingers and toes during that time. Even with the CONS listed, the game is absolutely a no brainer - 10/10. I wrote a awkward templar guide which got over 150,000 views, and although it's not viable anymore due to changes to the passive tree as it is, it should explain why the game just rocks.

There's minimal character progression, no drops on the levels (just some crafting components after rounds). Characters are NOT available for free to play players, you need to even buy the new characters. AVOID!",1.1 hrs on record,N/A

As it was the only thing I played in DotA2, that's an easy negative review from me.",129.3 hrs on record																					(107.0 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198242714680,1,N/A,Recommended,"I bought this game on a whim, thinking it was just a regular visual novel to pass some time. But the game was more than that. I was hooked from the beginning. The world is lively and the characters feel real. I had a hard time deciding who I wanted to befriend. There's a card battle game too that I found unique and fun. The card game is separate from the story and I think optional. I've just finished my first playthrough and I somehow managed to get an alternate route, so I'm excited to go through the story again and get something new! Seeing the achievements I haven't gotten yet I can tell there's a lot more to discover!",2.7 hrs on record,N/A

76561198242714680,1,N/A,Recommended,I just completed the main story and I adore this game. It was fun and witty. It kept me laughing.
