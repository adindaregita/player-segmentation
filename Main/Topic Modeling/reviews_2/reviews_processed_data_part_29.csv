Sadly, it's being review-bombed at the moment by followers of a popular Chinese streamer, which is really a shame (and something I hope doesn't negatively impact the devs)... But the game is super fun, and feels pleasantly-challenging in it's current state. I can see the devs making some balance tweaks over the coming days/weeks, but it's super fun and enjoyable - as long as you aren't expecting to win every single run without thinking! :)",6.1 hrs on record																					(0.7 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198107047766,1,Age of Rivals,"Indie, Strategy",Recommended,"I bought this game at full price right after a sale ended, but I'm not even mad- it's absolutely worth the asking price! What we have here is a really well-crafted card game, with a board game feel and some wonderful design work. Each game feels quite unique due to the cards that come into play making reappearances later on- I think it is fun to imagine a story to go along with each game and strategic play, as towers crumble to angry mobs, trade routes form and gain monopoly on desired resources, and empires resort to thieving and over-taxation out of desperation. I did want to touch on something a lot of people have talked about, though. There are complaints out there that this game is ""too random"". In certain gaming circles, ""random"" is pretty much a dirty word- people want their games to be entirely deterministic, but I believe this should not always be the case. Chance is a big factor in many famous games, both videogames and otherwise, and there is nothing wrong with using randomness as an element of your game's design *if* it is balanced well. If it isn't, it's extremely frustrating and pointless, but when it is, it can be an integral and fun game mechanic *while still feeling fair*. The game does utilize some randomness, especially in the drafting mechanic, but it uses that to it's advantage. Instead of being a card game where you have to painstakingly handcraft your deck and worry about being countered by someone else's and losing before you've even started playing, in this game you are building your deck as you play- building your deck *is the game*. The interesting twist on this title from other deckbuilders is that you have to work with what the game gives you. You'll end up playing quite interesting strategies sometimes due to the cards that come into play, and you also are given a lot of chances to try and counter the opponents deck as they are building it (though they might try to do the same to you!). There's also an element of risk-management in the element of chance in some card's effects, but you are meant to either use probability to your advantage (e.g. playing only one card of a type to guarantee it receives a certain buff), or take the chance of a negative outcome as the cost of playing a certain (usually more greedy) way- there has obviously been a lot of thought into the balance of when a little randomness could both help the card's balance and add some interesting strategic plays and moments to the game. I understand that gamers see all randomness as a horrible force of evil, but it can have some very interesting design implications, and if well tested and balanced the results can be a game that's even more balanced, replayable, and fun than a game that is entirely deterministic. This all comes down to personal taste, of course, but you can't deny that the devs have cared a lot about making each card feel fair to the game, and the synergies between them are where this game really shines. The only complaint I have about this game is that each card lacks a bit of personality- this is because each card as the same type-based artwork which, while quite pretty and identifiable, doesn't help make the cards stand out from one another or feel unique. I also think it would be neat if the cards each had a little flavor text, or even a fact from history, to give them even more flair (and give you something to look at while you're opponents make their move. I have asked the devs about this, and they are on board with the idea of adding flavor text in the future, and haven't ruled at doing individual card art at a later date, so I don't think this should be a dealbreaker, especially given the continuous dedication to the game the devs have shown. In conclusion, this game is absolutely worth a buy, especially if you enjoy deckbuilding games and want to try an interesting twist, or want to try a really well designed one out for your first foray into the genre :)",22.8 hrs on record																					(8.8 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198037222425,1,Monster Train 2,"Indie, Strategy",Recommended,"An amazing sequel to the stellar original!  I think some of the biggest additions beyond a whole new 5 factions, are dozens of pyres to unlock (all with their own unique perks), equipment (each of your units can have a single piece of equipment which will alter stats or give all new abilities), and room cards (sort of a global modifier you can play onto one of your trains 3 non-pyre levels that apply new modifiers just on battles on that level).",9.9 hrs on record																					(6.0 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198037222425,2,Clonizer,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"What might appear on the surface to be yet another Sci-Fi Slay the Spire clone, is actually pretty unique.  You are tasked with taking your Clonizer ship from planet to planet in order to conquer the planets by completing unique quests on each one.  The game's main gimmick is that your ship can spawn a near endless supply of little grunt clones you can use to both explore the planet as well as bop its indigenous hostile fauna.  While your clones are pretty disposable, your Clonizer ship is not, and any damage it suffers on a mission will carry over to future missions.  Keep going until your ship is destroyed or you defeat the last baddy of the campaign.  I love how the game's different Clonizer ships have their own sets of cards and thematic playstyles (like 1 Clonizer is all about enhancing your units with equipment and another is more focused on making your Clonizer a mobile weapons platform).",6.4 hrs on record																					(3.5 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198037222425,2,Beneath Oresa,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"A fun Slay the Spire-like with characters who play very uniquely from one another.  I love how before almost every encounter you can choose modifiers that can give you a mild benefit or maybe a big advantage but at the cost of at least a minor curse for the next battle.  They also have an interesting companion system.  These companions are never in the game themselves, but can offer you a number of thematic cards to add to your deck (like my support drone offering me up a number of defensive or attack all enemy cards).  Lastly, the combats always appear to take place in 2 zones with a number of your cards offering up bonus effects when targeting the nearby enemies or those further away.",5.1 hrs on record																					(3.5 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198037222425,2,Tilemancer Dungeon,"Casual, RPG",Recommended,"Fun concept in which you need to figure out how to best lay tiles to reach pre-placed exits and effectively build up your character.  Since you can't simply discard unwanted tiles, you need to figure out how to best use all of the potential garbage you've been dealt.

76561198037222425,2,Risk & Riches,"Casual, Indie, Strategy",Recommended,"While not the most polished looking, this game offers a couple of interesting twists to its Slay the Spire like gameplay.  The first big twist is its fun push your luck mechanic.  After each encounter you are shown the odds on what you next encounter will be (be it an event, combat, elite combat, or even a boss encounter).  Seeing these odds you need to decide to take your current winnings back up to the surface or plunge ahead, knowing that IF you are knocked out, you will lose most of the resources you've gathered so far (needed to unlock and upgrade facilities in the hub town).  Another fun twist is there are a lot of single use cards (permanently banished after use) but works in a card early on that can save single use cards if played the same round.",0.4 hrs on record,N/A

76561198037222425,2,Menace from the Deep,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"A good fun take on the Slay the Spire format of a Roguelike Deckbuilder with some clever twists like being given a 12 day calendar the end of which you WILL encounter the big boss, but, other than that, you'll always have a choice of 3 encounters for each day leading up to that point (with the choice you made getting replaced with a new option and the 2 unchosen options remaining).  Some fun extra style points come by way of each of the 3 characters having their own 8 starter decks to choose from, relics being parts of sets that, if you collect the same 3 themed relics will unlock an additional relic, and evolving cards based on how often they are used in battle (that defense card might be useless right now, but might as well play it, if you have nothing better to do at the moment, so it can level up at the end of the current encounter) and, in some cases, you can even decide how the card evolves between multiple branches.",10.0 hrs on record																					(6.2 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198037222425,2,Hunt the Pale Gods,"Casual, Indie, RPG, Strategy",Recommended,A very fun take on Slay the Spire like gameplay but with many innovative twists like often paying for abilities in MADNESS (either temporary effects of mental illness in this battle or taking on permanent nasty cards for a permanent gain of some sort).  They also seem to do a good job of H. P.

In this one your weapons are your stands, up to 8, that all can fire off their own unique melee, ranged, or magic attacks.  Where it gets clever, however, is how you evolve your stands.

While it could almost be seen as yet another Hades-like, that wouldn't be very accurate.  Each of the game's many characters play extremely differently and, while your character does level and improve their stats over a run, they start with all of their core skills (Trait, Attack, Special, and Defense) right off the bat and, as I found, it is 1 game worth giving a quick read of the character you're going to play's available actions as, in the heat of battle, the icons for their different actions might not be super intuitive.",11.1 hrs on record																					(3.0 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198037222425,3,[REDACTED],Action,Recommended,"Still new to this, but appreciate what they've done with the Hades template.  This time we're a prison guard racing against prisoners and other staff to the ONE escape pod.  Besides harvesting upgrades and resources to spend in the hub between rounds to better your chances in future runs, the game adds a clever competitive twist.  Besides simply needing to clear each room to proceed to the next, you have an incentive to do so as quickly as possible to race against your AI opponents to the end goal.  If speed itself isn't enough to get you ahead, being a prison guard familiar with the facility's many systems, you're able to remotely set traps for your opponents to either slow them down or maybe make them more vulnerable to the game's many environmental hazards.  While I love the concept of booby trapping opponents, this is normally performed via inputting exact quick time event combinations, which you can fortunately disable in options (so then you'd only need to designate a target and put in the first key of the necessitated combo).",4.0 hrs on record																					(1.3 hrs at review time),N/A

What might not have been made clear, however, is something I'd never seen in another one of these puzzley city-builders, which is fun WarioWare like mini-games.

During the day you run about gathering resources but once the sun goes down, you need to fight off all of the zombies until the area is clear.  Each run you start with your given hero and their base stats, but then, via collecting the right resources, upgrade their abilities over the run.  Each of the game's characters have their own unique power.  Killing zombies doesn't level your character up, but instead is the resource used to claim more territory which, in turn, means more resources, which means more upgrades.

Even this Tetris mini-game has some deep ramifications as each piece of trash grants stat bonuses to whichever character lies beneath it (each of the 4 characters take up 2 spaces of the 8 space wide grid) but if you can complete 1 or more lines when placing a piece, the whole party gets a thematic stat boost.",0.5 hrs on record,N/A

Your mission is to then figure out how to best allocate these various power cards into your ship's systems.  One system might need a single card of 3+ value, another might only work with blue energy card, or a third might not care the color but will only do their trick if you give them 2 power cards of matching value.  It reminds me a lot of the mechanics in the devices in Dicey Dungeon. All of your ship's components are installed along 3 rows of devices, and depending on how you've powered your various devices, by the end of the turn you'll have 3 beams of energy shooting out of your ship.  Where things get a bit tricky is the opposition will likely be firing 3 beams at you of various power levels and unless you can overpower each of those beams (match up to their beams with bigger numbers), your ship will take some damage.

While it retains most of the same mechanics, these dungeons feel like they have such limited item and monster pools so the levels are really tedious.  Also painful to me, at least in these story dungeons, death is so meaningless.  Something kills you?  No problem warp right back to that dungeon with all your gear and exp and try again.  Face something too tough?  Also, no problem, just redo an earlier dungeon to grind up enough so that later dungeon is no longer a threat.  The post story stuff can make or break this game, but as a guy not at all interested in the story and just wants a fun Mystery Dungeon game, you're far better off with Touhou Genso Wanderer: Reloaded.

While you can add armor on either side, you can only block (a percentage chance you have of stopping all damage from an attack) the side you are currently facing.  Another tweak in this game is how at the end of each round you'll have 2 different reward packages to choose from.  One might give you a few cards and heal you while the other might let you remove some cards and give you this game's equivalent of an artifact (an item that grants you passive bonuses in future encounters).",4.8 hrs on record																					(3.1 hrs at review time),N/A

One of the more interesting additions are campaigns for each table.  These campaigns are simply an ever increasingly difficult series of Challenge Mode missions (like how quickly can you get X score or how much can you score with 1 ball on a table without the lights, etc.) with a flimsy bit of narrative setting it up so as you progress through the missions, a bit of a story unfolds.",6.5 hrs on record																					(3.4 hrs at review time),N/A

Where it really shines, however, is all of the surreal bits you can add into your game like giant balls, conveyor belts, or balls that split when hit.  The game always has many challenges to complete that will require you to use the indicated table/ball/modifier and meet its requirements on your run (like make 3 long shots in a single run or pot multiple balls in a single shot).

Not only can you not modify your deck on the fly, unless you have a way to restore your discarded cards, until you exit the dungeon or find a special shrine, those played cards will not be accessible in future battles on this level of the dungeon.

While the game is kind enough to show you the initial path your ball will take with your planned shot, it also can be very cruel in giving you totally useless modifiers in a tight situation (all you need is multiple power modifiers to hit that ball down a long hallway but the game decides to just give you 3 curve shot cards this turn).

One HUGE improvement over the original release is that it is now much easier to deal with the game's many neutral sites.  These neutral sites aren't toned down (most are still nigh impossible for your early armies to defeat), but when you actually attempt to step onto them the game now lets you know what you'll be up against complete with the game's own Vegas Bookies telling your odds of coming out of this alive.

This creates a lot of tension as you'll often have to essentially burn a card for a sub-standard option if you want to use a key option on the other card.

Without any DLC, it contains the base game, the Mononobe no Futo and the Seven Trials DLC, The Bullet Reporter, The King of Fairies, and Miracle Ambitions (aka Versus Miracle Party), which were all absent from the original release of Mystery Gensokyo 3: Tower of Desire on launch, January 31, 2014. These were all included in the remaster: ""Mystery Gensokyo: Tower of Desire -RELOADED-"", released in NA on March 21, 2017. The only story DLC missing from that version was Clock Remains, which was released July 20, 2018, and also not included in the Steam and Switch version released as ""Touhou Genso Wanderer -RELOADED-"" on October 25, 2018, and was released instead as additional DLC. Lotus Labyrinth R is the remaster of Mystery Gensokyo 2(Fushigi no Gensokyo 2): Miracle Party, originally released December 30, 2011.

Even beyond improving on the original (adding new wizards, spells, units, etc.), at least one of the variants can be run natively in Windows! While this is all an amazing feat, please know going in, at the core, is a PC game from 1994, so while it's so cool to be able to play it again, the graphics and UI are going to be incredibly dated by today's standards (like Civilization 6 or Age of Wonders 3).",3.3 hrs on record																					(3.1 hrs at review time),N/A

There is a great variety in characters (primarily different stats and starting equipment), weapons, and baddies (including very tough bosses).  I find I really love/hate the game's tight ammo supply.  It keeps thing tense and often has you using non-optimal weapons as they might be the only ones you still have ammo for at the moment.  Also, since you can only carry 2 weapons at a time, the game really forces you to carefully weigh which ones you'll equip (and, nicely, as the game allows backtracking into previously cleared levels on a run, you're still free to switch back to any weapons you might have discarded earlier on the trail).",16.8 hrs on record																					(3.6 hrs at review time),N/A

The catch being it costs resources just to move and maintain them, and if you settle a colonist, they're then out of action (kind of like dying for points). Another big factor in your success is maximizing the use of your hand of cards by strategically upgrading the various worlds you've uncovered.  These cards will usually have some restriction as to where they can be placed and often a cost in resources to create.  Even cooler, if hard up for a given resource, you can simply discard a card to get 1 of the resource indicated at the bottom of the card thus forcing tough calls as whether to save a card for later or just cash it in.",33.1 hrs on record																					(3.2 hrs at review time),N/A

It doesn't feel super deep in complexity, but a lot like the recently released Tharsis, it can often be brutally difficult keeping the ship in one piece long enough to achieve your objectives. I think I've read others point out, that although, much like Sentinels of the Multiverse, this could be played multiplayer, I think it works better as a solo game as each of the roles, on their own, I think feel kind of 2 dimensional, whereas tyring to coordinate them all as a team is fun. It might just be my own inexperiencce with the game so far, but I find the toughest part of the game is having characters meetup in a given room, especially if it is not the character's room.  I mean I think I know how to do it but being able to coordinate at meetup where both characters can meet in room x while there is always pressing class based activities (which then instantly whisks the player back to their room if they attempt to do them), screws up most of my feebly attempted meetups.",4.0 hrs on record																					(3.0 hrs at review time),N/A

Since the latest major update not only have some 1200 cards been added but it sounds like they're even more generous with the free coins and chests.  I know every time I play, usually just a couple battles a session, I'm getting a few new packs (or chests as they're called in this game) to add to my collection either as direct rewards or bought with the cash I'd just earned (admittedly I do have the tripler in effect, which helps speed things up a lot). Compared to other CCGs, the game is definitely on the lighter/streamlined side of things.  While it now has some 1900 cards now, and unlike Yugioh, they almost all have a point (albeit there are some really odd cards that clearly, outside of pretty elaborate combos, I can't see be included in most decks).  Another honest admission is that when it comes to the monsters themselves, the vast majority of the cards in this game, it can at times feel like they filled out the ranks by simply recombining some handful of variables in every possible configuration (12 races x 3 classes x 24 different powers x etc.) although, under closer inspection, it is clear there are some powers primarily available to certain races and definitely not seen in all 3 classes). Another interesting aspect of this game is how simple they make it to buy or sell any of it's 1900 cards.  The basic rules that appear to govern this is that you can sell any card in your collection for roughly a fourth of its retail value which in turn is primarily based on its rarity (although there is a bit of supply and demand worked in as well, so expect to pay a little more than the straight rarity would indicate for a popular card and expect to get a bit less when selling a card there is no demand for).  If you're ever short on in-game cash just sell off those rarer cards you KNOW you'll never use. Lastly I also like how the game structures things with its 2 most common chests, the mini and full.  Mini chests, 400 gold for 6 cards, are the cheapeast way to really add a lot of cards to your collection for minimal cash with the only downside being that the distribution of cards is totally random and 90% it will just be common cards with a couple of uncommon thrown in.  Full chests, 1200 gold for 12 cards, while a far more expensive route to go for your cards, at least GARUNTEES 3 uncommons and 1 rare (or better).  So, as it stands, I find myself going back and forth between both chest types, minis to fill out my collection variety, making sure I at least have a wide breadth of all of the game's common cards, but still throw in a few full packs to get my guaranteed rarer cards.",40.4 hrs on record																					(17.2 hrs at review time),N/A
