For the first time i picked it up on The Orange Box in 2008, and from the moment I booted it up, I knew I was in for a wild ride. It wasn’t just a game—it was an event. The environments were absolutely massive, the atmosphere was unreal, and the soundtrack? Edgy as hell. Every moment felt like a cinematic journey.

Set in a world dominated by the Combine, an alien regime that combines interdimensional authoritarianism with advanced technology,The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut,0.0,Action,0, solve puzzles, explore diverse environments, and uncover the unsettling truth that nothing in this world is as it seems.

And let’s talk about The G-Man—a mysterious, interdimensional CIA glowman who pops up like a bad dream and probably controls the entire charade like a cosmic puppeteer. Is he good? Is he bad? Is he just playing the long game? Who knows, but he’s definitely got his hand in everything, watching Gordon like a hawk, pulling strings like an invisible god. 

You’d think it’s just a sci-fi conspiracy, but after a while, you start questioning if anyone really knows what the hell is going on. Does G-Man even have a purpose, or is he just a cosmic observer who gets his kicks out of watching a man with a crowbar take on the end of the world?

Released in 2004 by Valve, it redefined what players could expect from a video game in terms of both storytelling and gameplay. The game’s narrative is immersive, unfolding without traditional cutscenes, which allows the player to feel like they are truly part of the story. The protagonist, Gordon Freeman, is a silent hero who navigates through a dystopian world filled with alien invaders and oppressive human forces. This unique approach to storytelling pulls the player into the game’s world, making every action feel meaningful.

The physics engine in ""Half-Life 2"" was revolutionary for its time. The way objects interact with the environment feels natural and intuitive, and it became a major part of the gameplay. From solving puzzles using physics to creatively using the environment as a weapon, it was an innovation that influenced many games that followed. The gravity gun, which allows players to manipulate objects in real-time, is still one of the most memorable and fun weapons in gaming history.

The level design in ""Half-Life 2"" is another standout feature. The game introduces players to varied environments, from the dark, industrial city of City 17 to the eerie, remote marshlands. Each location feels carefully crafted, with attention to detail that makes the world feel alive. The pacing is also masterful, alternating between moments of intense combat and slower, atmospheric sequences that allow the player to soak in the environment and story.

The AI in ""Half-Life 2"" was also ahead of its time. Enemies behave intelligently, using cover, working together, and reacting to the player’s actions in a way that makes combat more dynamic and challenging. The enemy variety, from the terrifying Combine soldiers to the creepy headcrabs, keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging. The interactions with NPCs and the world around you help build a sense of tension and immersion, keeping you on edge throughout the experience.

The game's soundtrack, composed by Kelly Bailey, perfectly complements the atmosphere, using subtle but effective music to enhance both the action and the quieter moments. The sound design is top-notch, with ambient sounds adding to the immersion, whether you're in a busy city street or exploring a deserted warehouse.

Ultimately, ""Half-Life 2"" is a masterpiece that still holds up to this day. Its innovative gameplay, storytelling, and technical achievements make it a game that set a new standard for the industry. It’s a game that’s not just fun to play, but one that’s easy to appreciate for the way it shaped the future of video games. Even though it’s been years since its release, ""Half-Life 2"" remains a classic that continues to inspire both players and developers alike.

 | One of the best games of all time. You're using the game service that spawned because of their innovative ideas. Gaben please call me ill sell my bussy for less than you think ;)

Counter-Strike: Source (CS: Source) is the definitive version of one of the most iconic tactical shooters ever created. Built on the Source engine, it brought stunning graphics, refined mechanics, and an immersive experience that kept players engaged for years. It improved upon its predecessor, Counter-Strike 1.6, and laid the foundation for future games in the series, including Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Here's why CS: Source remains a perfect 10/10 for fans of competitive gaming.

Why It’s a Must-Play
🔫 Precise Gunplay
At the core of CS: Source is its tight and rewarding gun mechanics. Every weapon in the game feels unique, with its own recoil patterns and handling characteristics. This precision-driven combat is one of the key factors that makes CS: Source such a compelling competitive experience. From the M4A4's controlled spray to the AWP's one-shot kills, every engagement requires skill and accuracy.

🌍 Map Design & Tactical Depth
The iconic maps like Dust 2, Inferno, and Nuke are where the game shines brightest. Each map is meticulously designed to offer a balance of tactical positions, choke points, and strategic opportunities. Whether you're defending bomb sites or pushing through tight corridors, the map design fosters deep teamwork and careful planning.

💥 Gameplay Mechanics
CS: Source features smooth, fluid movement, making it easy to peek around corners, hold angles, and strafe while shooting. The buy system gives players the freedom to choose their preferred weapons and gear, while round-based gameplay forces teams to be efficient with their resources and execute well-planned strategies.

🎮 Vibrant Community & Modding Support
The modding community for CS: Source has been incredibly active, creating a wealth of custom content from maps to skins to even entirely new game modes. This extends the life of the game by offering nearly endless ways to enjoy the experience. The server browser lets players dive into unique community-run servers, making every session feel fresh and exciting.

🎨 Improved Visuals
Powered by the Source engine, CS: Source delivered a massive graphical leap from its predecessors, offering realistic lighting, better textures, and advanced physics. These improvements gave the game a more immersive and polished feel, while the physics engine introduced interactive objects and destructible environments, adding a layer of depth to gameplay.

What Makes It a 10/10
CS: Source isn’t just a game; it’s a tactical masterpiece that’s stood the test of time. Its emphasis on team coordination, strategy, and individual skill is unmatched. Whether playing with friends or random players, the experience fosters a strong sense of community and competition, making each match feel meaningful. The team-based objectives – like bomb planting/defusal – combined with tight, tactical combat is a dynamic experience that few shooters can replicate.

The longevity of CS: Source is a testament to how well it was designed. While newer titles in the series (like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive) have taken inspiration from it, the smoothness of the gameplay, iconic maps, and endless customization options keep it relevant in the competitive FPS scene.

If you’re a fan of shooters and haven’t experienced CS: Source, you’re missing out on one of the most influential and well-rounded tactical shooters ever made. It’s a game that offers both depth and accessibility, making it suitable for casual players, yet still offering enough challenge for the competitive elite. CS: Source is a timeless classic—pure, competitive, and still as enjoyable today as it was when it first released."

basically, what im saying is ""PLAY HALF LIFE 2: DEATHMATCH NOW, AND ALSO VALVE PLEASE UPDATE THE GAME, THIS GAMES LAST UPDATE COUNT IS LONGER THEN HOW LONG THE DINASOURS HAVE BEEN EXTINCT"" | Half-Life 2 Death match  is a very good first person shooter game. Fans of Half-Life 2, Team Fortress 2 and other first person shooter games should enjoy Half-Life 2 Death match | Just a game, which, in any decade, you can launch, and launch toilets in enemies.

Half-Life: Deathmatch: Source is a multiplayer first-person shooter developed by Valve. It is a remake of the classic Half-Life deathmatch mode, utilizing the Source engine. The game combines the fast-paced action of traditional deathmatch with updated graphics and more fluid movement mechanics. While it successfully brings new life to the original concept, some mechanical issues and a niche player base prevent it from being as popular as its predecessors.

What Works Well?
🎮 Classic Deathmatch Gameplay
The core of Half-Life: Deathmatch is its tight, fast-paced combat. It stays true to the original deathmatch mode, offering classic weapons, high-speed action, and simple, enjoyable mechanics. The formula remains as fun today as it was when first introduced.

🌆 Updated Graphics with Source Engine
The move to the Source engine has significantly improved the visuals compared to the original. The lighting, textures, and models are much sharper, breathing new life into the iconic Half-Life universe. The environments feel more immersive, and physics interactions are more dynamic.

🔫 Familiar Weapon Set
Players have access to a variety of classic weapons from the Half-Life series, including the crowbar, shotgun, and crossbow, all of which perform as expected. Each weapon has its own strategic value, and they all function well within the confines of the deathmatch setting.

🛠️ Modding Support and Custom Servers
As with other Source engine games, Deathmatch: Source allows for a robust modding community. Players can easily find custom servers and user-created content, from new maps to modified gameplay modes, keeping the experience fresh.

What Could Be Better?
❌ Limited Popularity and Player Base
Despite its solid foundation, Half-Life: Deathmatch: Source suffers from a relatively small player base. As newer games in the genre continue to dominate, it can be difficult to find active matches, especially in more niche servers.

❌ Physics Can Feel Clunky
While the Source engine improved many aspects of the game, some of the physics—especially in terms of movement—can feel a little awkward compared to modern shooters. The transition to 3D space feels a bit more restrictive than anticipated, particularly when compared to the fluidity of more modern games.

❌ No Significant Gameplay Innovation
While the updated graphics and better physics are great, Deathmatch: Source doesn't introduce any major changes to the original formula. It feels more like a polished port rather than a revolutionary step forward for the genre. Players expecting something drastically new may be disappointed.

❌ Lack of Meaningful Progression
Like many classic deathmatch games, there’s a lack of meaningful progression or any form of unlockable content. While this keeps the focus on pure skill-based play, some players may miss the more modern systems that reward long-term engagement.

Conclusion
Half-Life: Deathmatch: Source is a solid multiplayer shooter for fans of the classic Half-Life experience. Its updated visuals and iconic weapons deliver the fun, high-speed action that fans love, but its small player base and lack of major innovation hold it back from achieving greater popularity. If you’re looking for nostalgic deathmatch action or enjoy modding, it’s a great choice, but don’t expect a revolutionary experience.

Rating: 7/10 – Fun for fans of classic shooters, but somewhat limited by its age and player base. 🎮💥 | Half Life 1'in klasik ve efsanevi ölüm maçı modu oyunu.
Artık pek oyuncusu kalmasa da belki birkaç tanıdığınızla kısa süreli oynayabilirsiniz.
2. oyunun ölüm maçı modunu buna nazaran daha iyi olduğundan ikisi arasında onu tercih etmenizi öneririrm ancak bu da yine o half life zaevkini size verecektir. | It’s good and there are still servers if ur in europe buy it if ur not in eu you’ll probably have shit connection so don’t | 这老东西没人玩了，只能选人数不到两位数的服务器进去小玩一下。
其实竞技性还不错，人要是多会很有意思。但我还是要吐槽一下埋雷实在太恶心了。

Yapmayın oğlum söylemeyin şöyle şeyler..

Genel anlamda internet ortamında açıkça ve rahatlıkla eleştiri yapacak bir düzeye gelmişken ayrıca bir çok şeye tek bir tıkla ulaşıp araştırma imkanınız varken kendi fikirlerinizi oluşturmayıp neden başkalarından duyduğunuz şeyleri savunuyor ve insanlara yanlış algılar hediye ediyorsunuz ?

Yapmayın..

""Gerekli laf söyleme kısmını geçtiğimi göre şimdi oyundan bahsedebiliriz""

Her şeyin başlangıcı olarak verilmese de karakteri tanımamız ve hikayeyi anlayabilmemiz için gerekli oyun olarak karşımıza çıkıyor Witcher 1.

Çok güzel bir senaryo hazırlanmış öncesi hakkında bir fikrimiz yok sonrası ise tamamen muamma ilerledikçe kendimize ve hikayeye dair ip uçları ediniyor ve bir şekilde kafamızda yaşananları şekillendirmeye başlıyoruz.

[spoiler]Oyunun en başında karşımıza çıkan çocuğun en sonunda karşımıza çıkacağını kim bilebilir ki ?[/spoiler]

Oyun sırasında çok fazla npc ile diyalog kurabiliyor ana karakterimiz adına seçim yapmamız gereken çok fazla sahne ile karşılaşıyoruz.

Yetenek ağacı ise gerçekten harika oynamak istediğiniz stile yatırım yaptıkça harika kombolar ve hızlandırmalar sunuyor.

Dövüş sistemi sanıldığının aksine birazcık refleks birazcık dikkatli oynamak mantığında ilerliyor yeterli upgrade'leri alırsanız karşınızdaki 10 kişiyi havada 5 takla atarak inanılmaz artist şekillerde kesebiliyorsunuz.

Görev mantığı ise harika tüm oyunlarında olduğu gibi hangisinin side hangisinin main quest olduğunu size veriyor ve en önemli kısmı o görevleri yapabilmek için sadece bulunduğunuz haritada değil başka haritalara gidip gelebiliyorsunuz.

""Emek veriyorsunuz""

Bu oyun için gerçekten emek veriyorsunuz eski olmasına rağmen tek bir anında bile beni sıkmayan başından saatlerce kalkmadığım bir oyun oldu Witcher benim için.

Her anında insanları tek tek tanımak hikayelerini dinlemek yeri geldiğinde sarhoş olup ağzınlarından laf almak yeri geldiğinde genel evdeki kızlara çiçek götürmek her anı ile gerçekten harika bir oyun Witcher 1.

Yaptığım seçimler sırasında gerçekten zorlandığım noktalar oldu ben olsam ne yapardım Gerald aslında ne yapar kısımlarında bazı seçim ekranlarında oturup düşünmüşlüğüm var ve her şeyin sonunda tamamen benim verdiğim kararlara göre şekillenmiş bir son çıktı karşıma.,

Oyun beni tatmin etti mi ? Fazlasıyla..
Oyundan keyif aldım mı ? İnanılmaz derece..
Peki oyunun grafikleri çok mu kötü ? Hayır kesinlikle değil
Peki oyunun combat sistemi çok mu saçma ya da çok mu zor ? Hayır aslında inanılmaz basit
Peki gerçekten hikayeyi anlamak için ilk oyunu oynamamız mı gerekiyor ? ""EVET""

Neden bu kadar agresif cevaplar veriyorum ? şu yüzden..

İlk oyunu oynamana gerek yok diğer oyunlarda hikayeyi anlayabiliyorsun diyen arkadaşlarım dostlarım..
İlk oyunda öldürüp öldürmemenin kararı sana bırakılmış karakterler diğer oyunda sırf senin yaptığın seçime göre karşına çıkabiliyorken..
3. Oyunda dahi diyaloğa gireceğimiz karakterlerin başlangıç hikayelerini ilk oyunda öğrenirken..
Firma oyunun hikayesinin temelini ilk oyunda yaptığını açıklamışken ne demek lan ilk oyunu oynama diğer oyunlarda anlaşılıyor ??

Düşünsene Matrix'i öneriyorsun arkadaşına ve diyorsun ki ilk film'i izleme adam işte Matrix oluyor..

 | Este jogo é incrível, mas não é para todos, ele possui uma complexidade tática única, o que vai faz muita gente achar ele difícil quando na verdade se você usar a estratégia certa ele fica relativamente fácil.

[*] Gosta de RPG.
[*] Gosta de explorar.
[*] Gosta de Jogos com características táticas complexas.
[*] Gosta de jogos clássicos como os primeiros Dark Souls e Neverwinter Nights.
[*] Tem disposição para coletar e craftar itens.

[b]Evite este jogo se:[/b]
[list]
[*] Não gosta de Leitura, (Há muita coisa para ler no jogo)
[*] Não gosta de RPG ou escolhas complexas.
[*] Não gosta de ficar perdendo tempo falando com todos npcs e entrando em todos os lugares.
[*] Gosta apenas de lutar metendo a espada nos inimigos sem frescuras como magia e alquimia.
[*] Não gosta de jogos datados ou com jogabilidade estranha.
[*] Não quer perder tempo coletando e craftando itens.
[/list]

[b]Alquimia[/b]

O uso de poções não é opcional, é OBRIGATÓRIO. Neste jogo você precisa coletar itens como plantas e partes de animais, comprar e ler formulas para poções e óleos, crafta-los e usar de acordo com o contexto, inimigo e sua estratégia. Essas informações custam caro no jogo, tanto em tempo conversando com npcs quanto em ouro para comprar as formulas. 

[b]Inimigos e Combates[/b]

A parte mais divertida para mim e mais odiada para outros. No jogo você possui uma espada de prata e uma de aço, além de 3 estilos de combate, você precisa usar a arma certa no estilo de combate certo contra o inimigo certo, e juntamente com isso combinar a magia e alquimia para explorar as fraquezas dos adversários, isso é fundamental especialmente nos chefes. 

Os pontos fracos dos monstros e chefes do jogo também não são de graça, você precisa comprar livros, e falar com npcs para descobri-los, o que você pode facilmente perder durante a progressão do game ou simplesmente ficar sem dinheiro para adquirir as informações, deixando o game mais difícil e menos rico em termos de lore. De posse da informação você precisa ficar consultado o codex do jogo para elaborar as estratégias de combate. 

As coisas não explicitas no codex, por exemplo, ele diz que o chefe do primeiro capitulo é pouco vulnerável a magia Aard, se você se deu o trabalho de aprender ou usar a magia Aard em combate sabe que ela tonteia os inimigos possibilitando que você os mate com um só golpe. 

De posse dessas duas informações você pode elaborar a estratégia de fortalecer o Aard para matar o chefe ""super difícil"" do capitulo 1 com apenas um golpe.  Mas cabe ao jogador chegar nesta conclusão e planejar com antecedência. Parece algo simples mas a maioria dos jogadores não o fazem pois jogam irrefletidamente. [b]The Witcher não vai te pegar pela mão. cabe a você pegar os insumos que o jogo te oferece para ter uma boa experiência[/b].

[b]História[/b]

A lore da série witcher dispensa comentários, só não posso deixar de mencionar que em diversos momentos o jogo tem coloca entre escolhas morais de fritar a cabeça. Você sempre se pega tentando entender qual a coisa certa até se dar conta que no jogo não existe isto de coisa certa, e que ninguém é inocente.

Uma coisa importante é que a história avança de forma inesperada, é normal coisas ficarem para trás na primeira jogada, sempre tenha isso em mente ao entrar em um lugar ou completar uma quest, as vezes o jogo avança e algumas quests não podem ser completadas, outras o jogador acaba deixando passar. Desta forma o jogo tem um valor alta para quem for re-jogar. | Après avoir fini le jeu en 63h, je ne peux que le recommander.

Certes, il n'est plus au goût du jour, mais n'oublions pas qu'il date de 2008 : 

-  la fluidité des mouvements n'est pas celle d'un jeu de 2019 
-  la réactivité peut parfois être légèrement ennuyante (dégainer 3 plombes après le début du combat) 

Et pour ceux/celles qui n'aiment pas faire des allers-retours pour une quête, qui n'aiment pas prendre le temps de dialoguer pour récolter un maximum d'informations, passer votre chemin ! Par ailleurs, c'est un RPG ... il faut bien s'y attendre.  

Cependant, il reste immersif et on se laisse prendre au jeu ... et puis ... toute trilogie ne commence-t-elle pas par le 1e épisode si l'on veut en comprendre l'histoire complète ?   

N'hésitez plus ...

Sans compter que 1,19€ pour 63h de jeu (soit 0.018€ / h) ...

76561197976281073,500,Left 4 Dead,0.0,Action,0,"Left 4 Dead is a fantastic experience, especially if you enjoy co-op gameplay. Its frantic action, engaging dynamics, and focus on teamwork create a high-stakes environment that keeps players coming back for more. Despite being older, it still holds up as one of the best zombie shooters out there, and its influence can be seen in many games that followed. If you haven't played it yet, it’s definitely worth a shot! | Итак, Left 4 dead, первая часть знаменитой дилогии игр, созданная Turtle Rock studios, под крылом Valve, в далеком 2008. 
Наиграв 47 часов в первой части и 368 часов во второй, хочется сказать, что эта игра однозначно прошла проверку временем и в неё всё ещё приятно возвращаться.
Кроме того, хочется отметить пугающую, вызывающую чувство страха и тревоги  атмосферу, которую, можно ощутить зайдя в главное меню игры. Это сочетание женского мычания протягивающего  ноты, придыхания, пианино, а так же звука рации на зов которой, кажется, больше никто не ответит, задаёт мрачный тон игре.
А выжившие, словно тлеющий уголёк среди пепла сгоревшего мира, из-за всех сил  пытаются  остаться в живых.
Как по мне сюжет не самая сильная сторона игры, да он есть, но звезд с неба не хватает, хотя проработка мира, мелких деталей , лора на высоком уровне. Отдельно хочется отметить проработку персонажей, их диалоги между собой, подколки, шутки, видно что была проведена большая работа над этим аспектом  игры, что сильно повлияло на погружение. Это не просто болванчики им действительно хочется сопереживать.
Вообщем, я думаю стоит дать игре шанс, если конечно вы  в неё не играли, хотя конечно, онлайн в первой части очень и очень маленький советую играть только с друзьями | Рекомендую начать знакомство с этой серией игр именно с неё! 
- Почему же именно с неё ? 
- Во-первых, здесь не так много вооружения, а также отсутствует оружие ближнего боя.
- И в чём прикол ?
- Вам придётся креативить, чтобы спасти свою драгоценную жёпку )
- Во-вторых, благодаря затенённому цветофильтру игра превращается в нехилый такой хоррорец.
- А польза ?
- Если вы давно не меняли портки, то безоговорочно, польза тут есть!
- В-третьих, мало расходников, плюсом кампаний и персонажей, как среди выживших, так и среди заражённых.
- ...
- Опять же креативщина!
- В-четвёртых, поедет на старом компе. Игра не сильно требовательна.

- Но игра от этого хуже не становится ) | 还是感觉L4D2更好玩，不仅是支持创意工坊，而且机制也合理多了，一代的boss不是特感组合技而是烂大街的tank,而且燃烧瓶没那么好用，击杀tank只能纯靠枪械输出，没有近战武器也就算了而且副武器方面也只有双持的小口径手枪，用这玩意还不如一直用uzi,因此容易缺乏主武器的弹药，面对尸潮挺吃亏的。（空手推击、肘击倒是可以无限使用，推喷爱好者有福了）主武器方面，突击步枪只有m16a1,火力严重不足；唯一的自动霰弹枪m1014的视角动画和装填弹药方式也很捉急；狙击步枪mini14倒是还不错，这是我唯一觉得好用的。相比之下，二代是质的飞跃。但有了第一才会有第二，所以还是给一个好评吧。 | 求生之路是一个与侠盗猎车手同类的角色扮演类游戏。描写的是，金融危机全面爆发的2个星期后，4个无恶不作的歹徒的犯罪经历。Left 4 dead的意思就是让他们4个去死吧。

金融危机，造成部分人仇富心理极度膨胀。其中，一个退伍的孤僻老头，在华尔街下岗的一黑一白两个经纪人，一个因身材太差、在红灯会无生意的妓女，4人集中一起仇视社会，心理变态的恶果就是觉得街上所有人都面目可憎，于是，持械在街上，见人就杀，制造了一幕幕惨剧。

一对无助的恋人，为躲避他们的追杀，逃到教堂内，敲响警钟求助。4名歹徒依然不舍不弃，将闻讯赶来的无辜群众全部杀掉，再进屋杀死少女的男朋友，车仑女干少女致死。（教堂钟声局可进屋看见少女张开大腿而亡）

警方毕竟是文明的，没有用枪。特别是敦厚的胖子警官包墨儿，冒险口头劝告歹徒。但凶残的歹徒，竟只因胖子警官的口水沾到他们的衣服，把胖子警官打得死无全尸。

敦厚的胖子警官平时在社区深得群众喜爱。他的死，让人民群众奋起反抗。富有正义感的当地居民，在柔道高手亨特、擒拿高手斯冒克的带领下，向歹徒发起反抗。警察局也派出身穿防弹服特警坦克也参加了围捕。

凶残的歹徒，面对一波波的人民群众的反抗，选择劫持交通工具偷渡到邻国。

在这游戏里，既可扮演凶残的歹徒杀人，也可扮演正义的警官进行阻止。

从这个游戏看到，很多玩家喜欢扮演正义的警察，特别是争相扮演特警坦克，享受一拳把一个歹徒打到趴下的快感。可见，正义，永存人民心中！

It's really nice to not worry about resource farming and just focus on combat. You generate resources by capturing territory, which is something you would be doing anyway. The infantry units are made up of squads which you control in their entirety instead of by individual units, and their AI makes them take cover, go prone while under suppressive fire, etc. Lots of variety in units and everything has a purpose, even builder units are effective (e.g., American engineers can use flamethrowers which are great against infantry and buildings). | If you want a good RTS campaign this is for you, its gameplay mechanics unique over the traditional RTS games of the time. | 거진 20년 된 실시간 전략게임입니다.

 | The game also comes with a DLC, which includes the following items:

1. A Toxic Community: Mistakes are rarely forgiven. Unless you’re playing with friends, be prepared to face harsh criticism, often from younger players. The game’s multiplayer is largely populated by school-aged players who don’t hold back.


2. Disruptive Adults: It’s not just the kids causing chaos—some adults blast music through their microphones, assuming everyone else shares their taste. Spoiler: they don’t.


3. Frequent AFKs: Teamwork can fall apart when a teammate goes inactive, whether they’re brewing tea, taking a smoke break, or simply wandering off mid-game. And yes, it often happens right after you’ve generously used your first aid kit on them.


4. Team Abandonment: Lone wolves running off to the far corners of the map, only to be overwhelmed by infected, are a common sight. They’re quick to flood the chat with colorful language before rage-quitting the game.


5. Difficulty Disputes: Some players join games on ""Expert"" difficulty only to demand a downgrade. If their request is denied, they might sabotage the team before leaving the server entirely.


6. Vote Kicks: Occasionally, you’ll encounter players who inexplicably start a vote to kick you from the game. When you ask why? Crickets.



The Verdict: Despite the chaotic community, Left 4 Dead 2 remains a phenomenal experience. The graphics are a significant step up from the first game, the mechanics feel more polished, and there’s a greater variety of weapons and infected to enjoy.

Есть редкие достижения, куча пушек и толпа зомби, которая будет медленно наступать на пятки и их съедать. В общем, весело, рекомендую. | Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D2), released by Valve in 2009, is the gold standard for cooperative zombie shooters. Featuring intense survival gameplay, smart AI, and an incredible atmosphere, L4D2 delivers an unmatched multiplayer experience. With its fast-paced action, diverse weapons, and unpredictable enemy encounters, this game remains one of the most thrilling and replayable co-op shooters ever made.

Gameplay – Pure, Adrenaline-Fueled Action
L4D2 is all about co-op survival. You and three teammates must fight through hordes of the undead, navigating through various maps and completing objectives to reach safety. The key to survival? Teamwork, strategy, and adaptability.

The gunplay is tight and satisfying, with a wide selection of weapons including assault rifles, shotguns, SMGs, sniper rifles, and melee weapons like axes, katanas, and even frying pans! Every encounter feels dynamic, thanks to the AI Director, which adjusts the difficulty based on your team’s performance, ensuring no two playthroughs are ever the same.

Special Infected – Enemies That Keep You on Edge
Beyond the standard zombie horde, L4D2 introduces Special Infected that force players to work together:

Tank – A massive brute that can throw debris and crush survivors.
Witch – A terrifying enemy that, if startled, can instantly incapacitate a survivor.
Smoker – Uses a long tongue to drag players away from their team.
Hunter – A fast, agile infected that pounces on survivors and pins them down.
Boomer – Explodes in a shower of bile, attracting a massive horde.
Charger – Charges through groups, slamming a survivor into the ground.
Spitter – Creates pools of acid that deal heavy damage.
Each Special Infected forces different team strategies, making communication and positioning absolutely crucial.

Campaigns & Maps – A Horror Movie Experience
L4D2 features multiple campaigns, each set in diverse, apocalyptic locations across the southern U.S.:

Dead Center – A chaotic mall escape reminiscent of classic zombie films.
The Parish – A tense race across New Orleans to reach an evacuation zone.
Swamp Fever – A creepy, foggy swamp filled with infected dangers.
Hard Rain – A unique campaign featuring a devastating hurricane that changes the environment.
Dark Carnival – A fan-favorite, featuring a deadly amusement park with a thrilling rollercoaster finale.
Each campaign feels like a mini zombie movie, packed with cinematic set pieces, interactive environments, and intense finales.

Multiplayer & Game Modes – Endless Replayability
L4D2 offers several game modes that keep the action fresh:

Campaign Mode – Classic co-op survival through story-driven levels.
Versus Mode – One team plays as survivors, while the other controls the Special Infected.
Survival Mode – See how long you can last against endless waves of zombies.
Scavenge Mode – A competitive mode where teams race to collect fuel cans while being hunted.
Mutation Mode – Weekly game modifiers that add fun twists to gameplay.
Thanks to modding support and the Steam Workshop, the community has also created hundreds of custom maps, weapons, and campaigns, making L4D2’s replayability practically infinite.

Graphics & Sound – Immersive and Timeless
Even years after release, L4D2’s atmospheric lighting, detailed environments, and gruesome effects hold up well. Zombies react realistically to gunfire, and the sound design is masterful, with eerie background noises, terrifying growls from Special Infected, and intense musical cues that heighten the suspense.

The voice acting and character interactions bring the survivors to life, making them memorable and adding humor to the chaos.

Why Left 4 Dead 2 is a Must-Play
L4D2 is the perfect blend of action, horror, and co-op gameplay. Whether you’re playing with friends or AI teammates, the intense combat, unpredictable enemy encounters, and endless replayability make every match a thrilling adventure.

🔹 Final Rating: 10/10
Left 4 Dead 2 is a masterpiece of cooperative gaming. If you love zombies, action, and teamwork, this is an absolute must-play that still delivers endless fun and excitement after more than a decade.

It was recomended in gaming magazine. I tried it and I was pleased with mechanics since game sorta explains how game goes it just expects you to discover things on your own. Like no handholding at all.
You really need to understand how budgeting your army and positioning is king.
I got almost to the end at that time realized I wasted too much resources and couldnt finish it.
So after all these years finally finished it on normal difficulty.  
I must say it was satisfying I might try hard difficulty.
Pros: > It looks decent. Has it 2000s simple 3d look. Saturated colours that allows good distinction between forces.
>Runs good on modern hardware. Although it needed a reload when I alt tabbed.
> Decent story. Ok dont expect like modern masterpiece. It takes a lot storyvise from LOTR.  It allows to see the war from 3 sides.
> Has some interesting  unit choices. It differs from similar turn based strategy games. 
> Because of how fast (number of turns) you finish the mission you always question maybe I should sacrifice a unit so I can  finish mision faster but maybe I need expierience units more than gold. 
> Before every mision you get like a drone shot on how game expects you to on your army.
Cons:
> It has some weird resolutions on options menu and after some tries it finally looked decent and not streched on my Old LG Lcd screen.
> It has RNG that might not be everyones cup of tee. So you see that you deal 3 damage to opponent he deals 2 to you. theres posibility that you only deal 2 damage to you he deals 3 to you. And after 3 turns you understand that was the thing why you should reload save. 
> Tutorial is bare bones it covers like 30% of what you need to know. For some it might end the game right there when you dont understand in mission what just happened on the field.
> AI for enemy units are decent. But sometimes it feels too scripted since some units are just siting not doing anything but since line of sight works for other units then they should also act, but I understand that if it did that then player wouldnt  have any chance to win.
> Animations in cutscenes are still but remember it is turn based game in 2009
> Final cutscene ends little abruptly. But since theres is a sequel I guess it isnt a big issue. 
Score: 8.5/ 10 for me.°

Minor Spoiler alert from here and also some advice. 
Scouts are one of the best units. Dont get fooled on low stats.
Segment movement is very useful but you dont need it on every unit.
You need to conserve your money and troops. I let so many of unneeded troops go so to get some extra money that in later missions when I started missions I realized that theres no way I can win with no expierienced troops - I needed to redo most of the campaign. 
Good damage dealing units have impetuous and sometimes you will wish that they didnt have it.
You can forget to give artifacts to units and start mission and issue them on before positioning. After that its for $ and usable artifacts doesnt work a second time if previous unit died and you gave it to other unit.
Some of the best artifacts are found on sidequests maybe you dont needed that silver or gold misson trophy.
Hint for withstanding last boss his attacks very good at heavy ground troops at max level. Since he specializes for dealing good damage to heroes and has resistance to cavalry. + air support.

76561197976281073,47810,Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition,12.783333333333333,RPG,0,"After completing the fourth part of Dragon Age, I wanted to play the first part again. And God, how wonderful it is: strong characters, gorgeously written dialogues, an epic story, you just dissolve in all this. I had already forgotten that such games were once released and made.

You really get incredible pleasure from the dialogues compared to the fourth part. Dialogues here are like a separate art form, it is clear that the developers once worked hard. In general, this is not the only thing that can give you emotions, the game itself is very variable: this concerns both your backstory and your choice in certain actions, you are the creator of your story and what its outcome will be depends only on you.

Pros:
☑️🔝 An epic story with saving the world, where you are the chosen one and your decisions will determine what the ending will be, as well as a number of other important events. The right to choose, as in RPG games, is not an empty phrase here as in the finale of Mass Effect 3; 
☑️🔝 Well-written and interesting characters;
☑️🔝 Dialogues and the variability of their choices give exquisite pleasure;
☑️🔝 The ability to create a character and choose what your backstory will be;
☑️🔝 Interesting character leveling system. I found it very interesting to fight and level up my character;
☑️🔝 The atmosphere, music are top notch here;
☑️🔝 The ability to install mods.

And also many many other advantages, each of which is native and special for each person.

Even before the Steam version, I spent countless hours here, I spent many hours on certain events in the game, replayed this fantastic game many times. This game gave me so many pleasant and positive emotions that words are not enough to describe everything I feel about this game.

路过的薛姐：在说我吗？ | Dragon age: Origins, woah there's a game. If Skyrim is the guy in high-school all the girls wanted to date, but was really just average, and Fable was the nerdy awkward foreign exchange student all the juniors tried to bang, then where is dragon age? 

Dragon age is the 6' 8"" monstrosity of a man that fingered your girlfriend on prom night. No one expects Dragon age origins. DA is the guy that looms in the background dark and mysterious, but after hitting the showers fresh off an intense PE class, DA walks through to his locker butt-ass naked, with his full 10.3"" flaccid hog swinging freely.

That is to say, Dragon Age is bold. The game has mature subject matter dealing with death on massive scales, racism, class based societies, deception, grotesque body horror, and enough S.V.U. crime to keep Benson and Stabler employed for at least 3 lifetimes. Seriously, look at brood mothers and tell me DA didn't earn that mature rating. 

But dragon age is a complex character, just like Jack Reacher, Dragon age isn't just a brute. The game is extremely adept at exploring plot points in immersive and clever ways. Handles scenes that need finesse and understanding with expertise, and does a great job of both showing and telling the player about the world around them. But more than that, dialogue decisions and direct actions carry weight and will have repercussions later into the game. 

If you like well written and immersive RPG's that stick with you well past their run times then check out Dragon Age: Origins at your earliest convenience. 

 | В дни былой славы Bioware умели и могли так, что единственным эпитетом, полностью отражающим весь размах, было слово «ЭПИЧНО». Именно так, большими буквами. И эта эпичная история началась с релизом Baldur’s Gate, которая перевернула представление о компьютерных ролевых играх в своё время.

Потом были Baldur’s Gate 2, Neverwinter Nights, и с каждым релизом скилл канадской студии только рос. С выходом Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic сформировался именно тот образ «RPG от Bioware», который затем закрепился в умах игроков. Это было увлекательное приключение с масштабной историей, в которой можно было выбирать, как будут развиваться дальнейшие события, и живыми персонажами, реагирующими на действия протагониста и иногда выясняющими друг с другом отношения. А в 2007 разработчики выпустили Mass Effect, которая стала важной вехой в их подходе к геймдизайну ролевых игр — краеугольными камнями стали экшн и кинематографичность. Потом это ещё сильно отразится на их последующих играх, но к 2009 году концепция типичной ролевой игры Bioware образца SW KOTOR сохранилась.

Так вот, ЭПИЧНЫЙ Dargon Age: Origins. Духовный наследник серии Baldur’s Gate — так назвал DAO один из основателей Bioware, Рэй Музика. Игра действительно воплотила в себе все особенности BG (фэнтезийный сеттинг, фокус на сюжете и персонажах, боевая механика с тактической паузой), при этом сохранив самобытность за счёт интересного проработанного лора и атмосферы тёмного фентези. 

Главная особенность DAO — вариативность. Совершенно разные прологи при выборе определённой расы или класса — это, наверное, первое, что бросается в глаза. Игрок также решает, в каком порядке проходить сюжетные арки; от его действий зависит не только судьба ключевых персонажей, но и лояльность спутников. Делая конкретный выбор по ходу выполнения квестов или отыгрывая роль, игрок может выгнать спутника из партии или даже убить его. Спутники в Dragon Age это вообще отдельная история, говорить о них можно долго и много.

[quote]Лелиана: Я слышала, ты дочь Флемет, ведьмы из дебрей Коркари.
Морриган: А я слышала, что ты мыла ноги зимой и простудила мозги, но мы ведь все знаем, что это неправда. Но иногда слухи не врут, и в этом они правы.[/quote]

По части геймплея в плане прогрессии персонажа тоже имеется вариативность: игра за воина, разбойника и мага при определённой прокачке — это совершенно разный опыт. Если, например, играть за волшебника и выбрать специализацию Боевой маг, геймплей максимально преобразится: из дистанционного хлюпика маг превратится в танка в тяжелой броне с мечом и щитом. В системе прогрессии разных классов есть, конечно, сомнительные навыки, но тут, скорее, зависит от билда и предпочтений в стиле ведения боя.

Система лута и экипировка типичная для представителя жанра: с большим количеством оружия, брони и аксессуаров. Некоторые вещи улучшаются рунами.

Крафт довольно неплохо вписан в игровой процесс и максимально полезен на высоких уровнях сложности. Разделён на три категории: зелья, яды и ловушки. Заниматься крафтом расходников интересно — для каждой категории качается свой навык, нужны рецепты и ингредиенты. Что-то можно найти, что-то — купить. 

К слову, про купить. Экономика реализована хорошо — деньги не сыпятся как из рога изобилия, накапливаются с трудом, тратить всегда есть на что. На первых порах помогает воровство. Взлом тоже обязателен к прокачке, потому что в запертых сундуках можно найти уникальные вещи.

В общем, если вы уже играли в Baldur’s Gate или другие классические crpg, то в Dragon Age освоитесь моментально. Настоятельно рекомендую. Лично для меня DAO это прям представитель Золотого фонда cRPG, мастхэв и ""12 из 10"".

PS Пару слов о музыке добавлю. Инон Цур безусловно хорош. Иначе бы у Leliana's song не было столько каверов :)"
76561197976281073,620,Portal 2,0.0,"Action, Adventure",0,"Portal 2 is one of the best puzzle games ever created. It combines logical thinking, physics-based mechanics, and an engaging story. The game takes place in Aperture Science, a mysterious and dangerous laboratory filled with test chambers. The player controls Chell, a silent protagonist who must escape using the Portal Gun. This device allows players to create two linked portals on surfaces, making it possible to teleport and solve puzzles.

One of the most impressive aspects of Portal 2 is its level design. Each test chamber introduces new mechanics, forcing players to think creatively. The game starts with simple puzzles but gradually becomes more complex. Elements like light bridges, propulsion gel, and lasers add depth to the challenges. The difficulty curve is perfect, making the game enjoyable for both beginners and experienced players.

Portal 2 also stands out with its story and humor. The main antagonist, GLaDOS, is a sarcastic and witty AI who constantly insults and manipulates the player. Wheatley, a clumsy and funny robot, adds another layer of comedy. Their dialogues make the game more entertaining and memorable. Despite its humor, the story also explores themes of control, identity, and artificial intelligence.

Another great feature of Portal 2 is its cooperative mode. Unlike the single-player campaign, co-op requires teamwork and communication. Players control two robots, Atlas and P-Body, solving puzzles that require coordination. This mode enhances the experience, making it even more enjoyable when played with a friend.

Overall, Portal

Есть, правда, сомнения, как все это воспримут люди, не знакомые с первоисточником, — но такие «Ведьмаком 2» вообще заинтересуются вряд ли. Для тех же, кто помнит еще первую встречу Геральта и Фольтеста и может без запинки десять раз повторить имя нильфгаардского императора Эмгыра вар Эмрейса, игра станет самым настоящим подарком. | [b][h1]The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings[/h1][/b]

[b][i][h1]Graphics[/h1][/i]
The game has stood the test of time and still looks great almost 14 years later

[i][h1]Original books references[/h1][/i]
The game has many references to events from the books and some interesting characters that the CD gave new life to by adding them to the game and I like so much

[i][h1]Story[/h1][/i]
I really liked the story, it was very interesting and intriguing for me

[i][h1]2 times[/h1][/i]
2 times. You have to finish the game 2 times to see whole content. In the game, at the end of Act 1, you will have to make a choice that will affect the further story. Because of this choice, we have a two completely different Act 2. I mean completely different locations, characters, quests, etc. How many games like this do you know?

[i][h1]Characters[/h1][/i]
Geralt, Triss, Dandelion, Zoltan, Roche, Iorweth.. They are cool

[i][h1]Side quests[/h1][/i]
Here you will see a lot of good side quests in the game and I don't remember of a single bad one. I'm serious here. I really don't remember a single bad side quest in the game[/b]

[h2]±[/h2]

[b][i][h1]Music[/h1][/i]
The ambient is beautiful, I really liked it very much. About OST.. There is not much OST in The Witcher 2. And among this small number there is a really good OST but there is very little of it and hearing the same OST every time in the same location throughout the entire act is a bit disappointing[/b]

[b][i][h1]NPCs[/h1][/i]
They are not alive. They do not have their own daily routine as it was in The Witcher 1. They either sleep or stand in the same place and do the same animation

[i][h1]Broken economy[/h1][/i]
The traders here are richest people in the world because they sell things for some unrealistic prices, but you sell them for pennies, and it doesn't matter if it's trash or one of the best armor in the game. You really have to grind(kill monsters and sell them for nothing) if you WANT to buy recipes and craft armor set that appears on higher difficulty in each act. I only lasted for two acts. Not for me

[i][h1]Combat System[/h1][/i]
Absolutely broken. Set traps for a few seconds [i]during[/i] combat? Traps that Geralt should set before combat? Yes. Enemies block your attacks without block animation? Yes. Enemies ignore your attacks and continue their attack animation and kill you? Yes. CD in one of the updates disabled health regen during Quen, thinking that it was better? YES. Bad QTE? Yes. Bombs and knives are OP? Yes. I wouldn't say that these problems greatly affect the gameplay and perception of the game, but the fact that they exist is annoying. The combat system in The Witcher 1 was much better

[i][h1]Tons of cut content[/h1][/i]
Typical CD Projekt[/b]
[hr][/hr]
[b][h2]9/10[/h2] | ""The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings"" is a critically acclaimed RPG that builds upon the strong foundation laid by its predecessor, offering a deeper, more refined experience. Released in 2011 by CD Projekt Red, the game is set in a dark and gritty world full of political intrigue, moral ambiguity, and complex characters. It follows Geralt of Rivia, a skilled monster hunter, as he becomes entangled in a conspiracy involving the assassination of kings and the fate of the entire continent. The game’s story is rich and engaging, with choices that truly matter, allowing players to shape the narrative in meaningful ways.

One of the most striking features of ""The Witcher 2"" is its branching storyline. The game offers multiple paths depending on the choices players make, particularly during key moments. This results in different quests, character interactions, and even entire endings. The world feels alive and reactive, and the player’s decisions carry weight, making each playthrough potentially unique. This level of player agency is one of the game’s greatest strengths, as it provides a deep sense of involvement in the unfolding drama.

The combat in ""The Witcher 2"" is fast-paced and strategic. Unlike many RPGs that rely heavily on simple hack-and-slash mechanics, this game requires players to think tactically. Geralt uses a combination of swords, magic, and alchemy to defeat his enemies, and mastering each of these elements is key to surviving tougher battles. The game also features challenging boss fights that demand careful planning and quick reflexes. While it can be difficult at times, the combat feels rewarding, and successfully defeating a tough opponent provides a real sense of accomplishment.

The world-building in ""The Witcher 2"" is exceptional. The game’s settings are varied, from war-torn battlefields to lush forests, crumbling castles, and bustling cities. Each area feels unique, with its own culture, history, and lore. The attention to detail is remarkable, and the game does an excellent job of immersing players in its world. The character design is similarly impressive, with a cast of memorable individuals that are morally complex and believable. The game’s voice acting, writing, and character development all contribute to making the world feel lived-in and full of depth.

Another standout aspect of ""The Witcher 2"" is its mature and morally gray storytelling. The game doesn’t offer simple good-versus-evil narratives; instead, it explores themes of power, betrayal, and the consequences of one's actions. Many of the choices players face are morally ambiguous, and there’s no clear ""right"" or ""wrong"" answer. This makes the game feel more grounded in reality, where actions often have unintended consequences, and characters are rarely just one-dimensional.

While the game’s graphics were impressive for its time, it’s the overall atmosphere and attention to detail that truly stand out. The soundtrack enhances the experience, with a score that captures the tone of the game perfectly, whether it’s a haunting melody during a quiet moment or a fast-paced theme during combat.

""The Witcher 2"" is a game that appeals to players who enjoy a more mature and complex narrative. Its story, world-building, and choice-driven gameplay make it one of the best RPGs of its generation. It’s a game that rewards exploration and thoughtful decision-making, and it challenges players to consider the deeper consequences of their actions. With its engaging combat, morally complex characters, and immersive world, ""The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings"" remains a standout title in the RPG genre.

 | Witcher serisinin üzerine yapışmış saçma bir algı var ""1. ve 2. oyun çöp. Direk 3. oyunu oynayın."" diye. Hadi 1. oyunun mekaniklerini beceremeyip bu eleştiriyi yaptınız (ki ilk oyun da harikadır benim için) da arkadaş bu güzelim oyunu niye araya kaynatıyorsunuz? Son derece keyifli, hikayesi sürükleyici, grafikleri bugünden bakınca bile etkileyici bir yapım. Oynayın, oynatın. | Most people said that TW3: Wild Hunt is more enjoyable if you've played the first two games first. After doing so, that most certainly isn't the case. These felt kind of like a waste of time overall, I'd say you're good just playing the third if you're unsure of where to start. 

The main reason I went back and played the first two Witcher games was because I started a playthrough of TW3 and felt like I was so behind on the lore and characters of the universe. I kept encountering characters that the journal said Geralt had met in previous adventures until finally I decided to cut my losses 50+ hrs in and complete the first two games first before returning. 

But both stories in the first games are fairly inconsequential. TW1 is definitely unnecessary, only giving you a glimpse of who Geralt and a few of his closest friends are while pursuing a criminal organization. TW2 shows the political state of the kingdoms just before the third game, and some brief flashbacks into Geralt's forgotten past before his amnesia, but that's it. 

None of the characters I'd thought were in the first games like Ciri, Yennefer, Keira Metz, Sigismund Dijkstra, the two people burning at the stake in a certain city that the journal says Geralt knew, etc, are even in them. Okay, maybe one of the people burning at the stake is at least in TW2 but they were just a merchant near the end of the game with one line of dialogue, at least in my playthrough. They had no role in the story at all. I'm left to assume most of the story I thought I missed out on is in the books, not the earlier games.

So I gained nothing from playing this. On top of that the games were kind of boring. Dialogue was decent but even compared to the first game TW2 was disappointing. TW1 impressed me more in some ways. 

The quests felt more involved in TW1, where simply following what we were being directed to do in the journal could lead to screwing ourselves over. I often had to think, and pay attention to what someone said earlier for a clue on how to properly move forward. Nearly every time I made progress during a quest, I could chat with a character I knew who would have new dialogue for me, unlike TW2. Sometimes we could talk to a character other than the one on our objectives for a better outcome. Here everything is just straightforward, follow the next objective, no thinking required. 

Romances in TW1 felt more rewarding and the opportunities were much more numerous. I didn't even pursue them and ran into quite a few. It felt like a mini-game of its own since there were romance cards to collect. Looting also felt more important, whereas in TW2 we just get a bunch of crafting items/herbs I never even used. Most of it I just sold since I had so much with no use for it. And not being able to select the loot individually felt dumbed-down. Potions felt ineffective in TW2 and having to predict when I might need them was annoying since we could only consume them while meditating, so luckily they could be largely ignored on ""Normal"" difficulty. 

I could describe a bunch of other things that TW1 did better, but also some things in TW2 just weren't as much of a step forward as I'd expected. There weren't many choices I made in the game that I felt made a difference later down the line. The game failed to introduce a sufficient number of interesting characters throughout the story; there are very few worth remembering. Contracts were also very scarce and simplistic. The monster variety was severely lacking, mostly just Nekkers, Endregas, Harpies, and occasional Rotfiends. Gear still felt minimalistic in that it wasn't impressive-looking and there wasn't much to be found in the entire game. The variety in areas the game takes you to isn't there either, it's just 3 different locations all of which are boring: a swamp outpost, a muddy camp, and some old ruins. The game basically all happens in settlements, like the first game.

Also TW2 is a short game, only 36 hours and I took my sweet time + read all the journal/character/location/monster entries.  It's really only better than the TW1 in graphics and combat, and the TW1 wasn't a great game either. 

Both of these are like a 7/10 for me. Enjoyable enough to make it through one full playthrough, but I've no desire to ever play them again. Hopefully TW3 actually lives up to the hype, and I'll at least have some characters appear in it which will help make the time spent here worthwhile when I import my save to it.

76561197976281073,202200,Galactic Civilizations® II: Ultimate Edition,0.03333333333333333,"Indie, Strategy",0,"One of the best civ-esque 4X games in a space setting that in some aspects has still not been surpassed in 2025.


Pros:

+ All 12 races have unique tech trees, AI personalities, diplomacy text and more.
+ Chess-engine type dynamic AI that has not been surpassed in any other 4X game and plays by the same rules as you.
+ Truly impactful galactic event system that keeps each game fresh.
+ Lots of different strategies to excel in, from influence, economy, diplomacy to war.
+ Actually really nice soundtrack for a 4X game.
+ Ability to create and download custom races and ship styles. (You can totally set up all Star Trek races).
+ A lot of content after 3 expansions, both in mechanics and in campaigns.
+ Well balanced and bug free after many years of community patches.
+ Runs on any computer and looks alright if you max everything out.

Cons:

- it's a game from 2008, expect some really shitty CGI and a lot of videos and UI elements to look a little low-res on modern resolutions.
- No in-game encyclopedia leaves you looking through the included manual, ""Community Edition Guide"" and old forum threads to figure out the intricacies of gameplay mechanics as the game came out before community game wikis became commonplace. 
- Default ship designs are lacking, you are forced to use the ship builder to make optimized ship designs, this can be a chore and will lead to ugly designs if you can't bother to take the time to artfully place the modules.
- Ship designer does not let you modify the auto-generated designs.
- Suffers from the common ""Space is empty"" curse. No actual terrain, lots of uncolonizable planets and just deep space that is not fun or very distinctive either visually or strategically.
- Compared to stuff like Stellaris, planets are mostly samey as well.
- Civ4 style stacked combat system that does not really care for positioning outside of starbases.

 
Overall I would recommend it just for the very tight gameplay loop and good AI leading to very interesting gameplay. | O jogo é desafiador e bem completo. Cada raça tem vantagens e desvantagens e trazem caminhos distintos para a vitória. | Yet another fun 4x game franchise.

thank you for another steam reviewer for making me aware of the community enhances edition | Best modern X-COM game! It really feels the atmosphere of the original X-COM of the 90s: it has the same level of squad-based freedom tactics that are good and solid. It's very realistic in terms of tactics and assault. You can can plan your actions as you like and there's no limits or simplifications like in other late X-COM parodies where you can either run or gun, and if you perform shooting action then you can't move anymore. Here you can move then shoot then move again: just use your action points wisely the way you want. The game is really thrilling and is a gem for X-COM lovers. I still think that the best X-COM games are those made by MicroProse in 90s and the Xenonauts, but not the parodies of 2K that have the same name but with much simplified battle gameplay. 
Get this game and you will have 100% satisfaction! | i love the game, but hate the reapers, you see big purple bugs you run the hell the other way, get everyone on the dropship and abort the mission itll be hell.

That being said, it is extremely well done and delivers exactly what it promises. 

The only regular bug that I have come across is corrupted auto-saves in ""Ironman"" mode which is typical of all games that use this type of save scheme (note: regular mode allows manual saves)

Like XCOM, the games difficulty spikes quickly at the beginning, but becomes more manageable once you begin researching and producing new technologies.

The game also comes with an ""open"" version that allows and organises the use of mods (found on the games Steam community page) | Nie trzeba polecac. Poleca się samo.

1) убей вражин (от 10 до !200!)
2) собери предметы (от 10 до !60!)
3) отнеси ящик (если повезет то один)
4) зачисть подземелье с боссом в конце 
 И эти миссии не будут даже чередоваться, вам могут 10 раз подрят дать задание кого то убить))
 На 70 же уровне, открывается самое интересное!! Дабы получить себе топ НЕ ДОНАТ шмотки ты должен продолжать делать свои любимые квесты каждый день)) За задания тебе уже не будут довать опыт, а начнут давать ""репутацию"" у торговцев этим самым шмотом) Дабы собрать все, вам придется играть месяцев 4-5 посвещая по 2-3 часа в день дейликам.
 Но не все так ужасно. На 70 уровне вы можете ходить в подземелья и фармить шмот там. Вы ведь качали паладина? Нет?! Так тут других классов просто не берут в данжи, потому что они на много слабее как по урону, так и захилу, о чем вы вообще думали?!
 Теперь про донат, ведь игра бесплатная, а это значит что платить нужно во время игры, а не перед. Он тут влияет на все, на скорость перемещения по карте, на то сколько опыта ты получишь, шмота и какой шмот. Размеры доната зубодробительные, премиум 1000р, сумка 500р, быстрый маунт от 500р.  Имеется возможность сразу купить себе шмот, или заточку оружия, вам гарантируется нагиб в любом пвп или пве (около 1000р за предмет) . На то что бы достич этого без доната вам понадобится 3-4 месяцев и всё твоё, а пока лучше тебе не ходить в пвп. А в данжи тебя и так не возьмут) 
 Итого мы имеем гриндилку. Вся игра будет заключаться в затыкивании врагов левой кнопкой мыши. Здесь нет скила, от вас не требуются некакие навыки (бой с любым боссом выглядит как постоянное выбегание из красного круга на земле) все что нужно для успеха- это куча времени на фарм мобов. | A disclaimer - it's a game set in Forgotten Realms universe, but don't expect DnD-like gameplay. 

Now what should I say about this game...
Neverwinter is a MMORPG, and a really good one. I was somewhat off for the first few hours, but the game gets better and better with every hour you spend in it. 

A disclaimer #2 - if you don't like timegate mechanic and grinding dailies don't read further.

Let's start with some pros:
+ Setting - I'm definitely a FR lover. You should know that Salvatore helped with writing some of the quests in the game. You will also meet some amazing characters like Bruenor Battlehamer, Drizzt Do'Urden or Minsc&Boo. 
+ Music - wether you're in the heart of Neverwinter, traverse the Underdark or purge the Dread Ring of the undead you'll always be accompanied by really nice tunes. It's an MMO so obviously music does not play THAT BIG of a role, but the tracks playing at the background do not disturb you.
+ Character development(bright part) - it's really well made. While power upgrading does not matter much, traits and boons can passively make your character stronger in different ways(for example make your trap also deal damage over time, and even stronger against immune targets)
+ Combat - you're basically on the move all the time, combat is dynamic, there is a lot of dodging, blocking and watching out for enemy attacks
+ Endgame - that is just my opinion but endgame is great. Dungeons are challenging(unless you get boosted by that 3k+ player), long, bossfights are fun. There is always something to do due to campaigns which not only give great rewards but boost your character stats via boons. Also progress is slow paced but significant enough to see the difference between those two items, 30-40 item levels or that one tier of your artifact. 

Cons
- Hard to earn currency - getting AD as a fresh player is a pain in the arse. Enough said. 
- AD to Zen converting ratio - Zen is that ""real money"" currency of NW. And while gathering AD to exchange for Vip(1k Zen - 500k AD) is not that big of an issue, trying to get AD to buy Zen while also managing your characters equipment is. Artifact here, refinement stones there, goodbye 120k AD here. 
- Outdated graphics - we're in 2017, yet graphics sometimes feel like a 2012 game. It doesn't look bad, it had actually aged quite well, but I think devs should consider making some upgrades here and there. 
- Character development (sad part) - boons from campaigns are a double edged sword. They greatly increase character capabilities, but good luck getting most of them. Some of them are after huge timegates(ToD, Dread Ring, Underdark) and others are just annoying to start with(Icewind Dale, fuck you).

My final mark would be somewhere around 7 or 8 out of 10. It's definitely a game worth at least trying out. | Fraichement arrivé niveau 70, il me semblait important de faire une évaluation de ce jeu auquel je n'attendais pas grand chose. En effet, j'ai appris la connaissance de ce jeu via un ami qui l'avait télécharché sur sa playsation 4. Je l'avais regardé joué quelques heures sans grand intêret étant encore en Juillet dernier sur World of Warcraft et Blade and Soul. Mais voilà, ayant démémangé aux Etats Unis, j'ai du arrêté Wow dût fait de mon temps de jeu qui ne serait pas assez important pour pouvoir accomplir ce que je voulais.

Je me suis donc mis à la recherche d'un nouveau jeu qui pourrait occuper mes temps de loisirs, mais ou l'exigence serait revu à la baisse, afin que cela corresponde mieu à mon nouveau style de vie.

Après avoir essayé, Wildstar, SWORT, Lotro et j'en passe, je n'avais pas été du tout convaincu, pas tant par la qualité du jeu, mais pour encore son modèle qui ne me correspondait pas. 

Par tout hasard, je décide de télécharger Neverwinter, afin de voir ce que cela donne, et je suis actuellement lvl 70, et je ne compte pas arrêté de si tôt.

Les points positifs:

1) Races : Tout d'abord Neverwinter m'a plus dès le début pour ses races que l'on a à disposition. Je l'ai trouve plutôt varié et bien adapté à l'univers héroique fantaisy. La personnalisation est très correct, je dirais au dessus de la moyenne actuelle, et permet de differencier son personnage des autres joueurs. 

2) Les Graphismes: ayant plutôt une belle marchine, je peux facilement faire tourner Neverwinter à fond, et je trouve les graphismes très satisfaisant. Dans un MMORPG, des graphismes de dingues à la Gear of War sont pour ma part obsolètes, une pâte artistique est bien plus pertinent. Je retrouve un mélange de Lotro et World of Warcraft qui est très appréciable.

3) Le gameplay: Je trouve le gampelay très bien fini et surtout très accessible. Avec une dynamique à la Tera, Neverwinter propose un style de jeu plutôt bourrin qui change des habitudes. En revanche, le nombre de compétences est limitées, de ce fait le gameplay ne demande pas une haute exigence, et sera plutôt accessible à la majorité des joueurs. 

4) Le monde instancié et cloisoné: Alors oui, pour beaucoup, cet aspect serait un défaut, mais pour moi c'est plutôt un +. En effet, même si l'immersion est un peu mis à mal avec ce système, je trouve que cela permet de gagner du temps, chose que j'ai besoin au vu de mon planning.

5) La personalisation : Il y a beaucoup de moyen de personnaliser son personnage via les talents, atouts, caractéristiques et pouvoirs, afin de vraiment crée un personnage unique.

6) La boutique : Je trouve la boutique très bien faite, et permet aux joueurs qui n'ont pas un grand temps de jeu, de leur rendre la vie plus confortable et de gagner du temps. Je ne suis pas du tout contre ce genre de pratique, tant que cela ne devient pas trop Pay to Win. Après pour les gens qui ne veulent pas payer, ils pourront exactement arriver au même résultat, mais en prenant surement plus de temps. 
Après il faut pas rêver, la gratuité réèlle n'existe pas dans notre monde, et mettre 50 euros dans un jeu n'est pas non plus la mort, quand on connait le prix d'un paquet de cigarrette.

Les points négatifs : 

1) Le Lore : j'ai été assez décu par l'histoire générale du jeu, qui pour moi ne donne pas l'impression d'être réèllement impliqué dans quelque chose d'important. Peut être que cela s'améliorera au fils des futures campagne, mais pour l'instant l'envi de lire soigneusement les quêtes n'est pas encore arrivée.

2) Répétivité des quêtes : Courant dans la plupart des MMORPG, chaque donneur de quêtes va toujours vous trouver un escuse pour que vous alliez basher du mob. Cela devient un peu agaçant à force. La variété des quêtes est selon moi pas assez prononcé. En revanche le doublage est de bonne facture que cela soit en Français ou en Anglais.

3) La musique : La musique n'est pas très prenante, et ne favorise pas l'immersion dans le jeu et son côté épique. 

4) Variété des maps: Je trouve quelques fois une certaine redondance des maps, surtout celles des donjons qui semblent toujours être plus ou moins pareil.

Conclusion:

De mon point de vu, Neverwinter est un MMORPG de qualité, et n'a rien à envier à ses conccurents actuels. Il ravira les personnes qui ont des exigences plus basse que la moyenne en terme d'investissment et qui veulent plus prendre du fun que d'avoir le meilleur dps du jeu. 
Je pense que Cryptic à réussi le pari de la stratégie ""bleu océan"" qui consiste à capter une nouvelle catégorie de joueurs qui n'étaient pas interessé par les MMORPG auparavant ou qui veule moins se prendre la tête.s 
C'est pourquoi, Neverwinter se trouve dans une bonne situation financière et va perdurer dans le temps, car il ne cherche pas à conccurencer directement les mmo déjà bien installés dans le marché contrairement à un Wildstar qui n'a pas pu trouvé sa place et qui brûle à petit feu. 

Voilà,

Merci pour la lecture !

I started like 12867 years ago when it came out on Kongregate and it was awesome! Wild Shadow did everything perfect with this game.  Then Kabam bought them out and turned it into more of a pay to win.  Kabam did some good, but mostly bad.  They owned Realm for a long time, but very recently a company called DECA bought it from Kabam.  DECA has been incredible in my opinion.  They have released more updates in two months than Kabam did in 5 years.  New things and skins and map changes, it's exactly whatneeded to happen.  So, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants to play it right now.  About 6 months ago I would've said not to bother.  I just hope DECA keeps with it | 10/10

However, the fact that it is not original in itself compared to the actual banner saga game, and the fact that no one is able to play the game, as there is no one to play against in this multiplayer only game, makes this game a little less than promising. I would not waste time on this until the developers work on the game to increase popularity, through advertising or working on the game's content, of which it is lacking, if at all.

If you wish for a surface level horde shooter with fun abilities then it will give you that experience in spades, however, it also has the ability to allow you to delve deeper into its systems and lets you customize and maximize your arsenal until you become a walking army.

The story is serviceable in the beginning but in my opinion ages like wine as you progress through the star chart, slowly pulling you into an experience that I have yet to relive in any other Sci-Fi game I've played. While it does go off the rails at times it does so in a way that feels believable and maintains a sense of internal consistency that keeps you informed while still asking questions.

Each frame feels unique even though the devs have released over 50 differing characters, each with a unique kit that (while falling into a manageable amount of categories such as caster vs weapons-platform) still allows players to express their own uniqueness through their selection of frames and weapons. It is rare that any two players' loadouts will be identical to one another.

It is definitely a game I recommend everyone to play at least once and one I definitely recommend to anyone who loves long grinds, deep (though sometimes confusing) mechanical systems, and extreme horde shooters. | Hermoso juego que siempre esta mejorando.

76561197976281073,238960,Path of Exile,0.016666666666666666,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Free To Play",0,"Path of Exile (POE) não é um MMORPG, como a maioria o classifica. POE é, na verdade, um action-RPG online. Você não tem necessariamente que interagir com outros jogadores se não o quiser, e mesmo que o queira, sua interação é limitada apenas a um chat global e a alguns poucos (5) jogadores que você, por ventura, permita que entrem em sua equipe (party).

Considerado o sucessor verdadeiro do Diablo II pelos mais saudosistas, Path of Exile é um jogo bastante interessante para quem gosta de RPGs hack-and-slash com uma grande gama de possibilidades em suas builds. Com uma árvore de habilidades de mais de 1300 pontos diferentes além de um complexo sistema de crafting, cada personagem torna-se único em seu potencial, apesar de, no momento, não ter tantas possibilidades de customização visual.

Após mais de 4000 horas jogadas, sinto-me confiante que posso dar o verdadeiro valor ao jogo nessa análise sem, no entanto, deixar de considerar seus pontos fracos. Por isso, vamos por partes:

[h1]Conceito e Existência[/h1]
Path of Exile é um jogo que foi desenvolvido desde seu início para dar aos saudosistas jogadores de Diablo II um ar de renovação. Chris Wilson, o líder do projeto, e seus companheiros fundaram uma empresa chamada Grinding Gear Games, a atual responsável pelo gerenciamento do jogo, e decidiram dedicar-se exclusivamente ao desenvolvimento de POE.

Seguindo o modelo original de Diablo II, o Path of Exile tem point-of-view semelhante, embora com gráficos melhores e atualizados para uma nova geração (inclusive, recentemente, recebendo suporte a DirectX 11 e algumas funcionalidades exclusivas deste), além de conter o mesmo 'feeling' de grinding que tanto tornou Diablo II famoso.

[h1]Jogabilidade[/h1]
Com uma árvore de habilidades de mais de 1300 opções, além de 6 raças iniciais, POE tem uma jogabilidade altamente imersível e de grande liberdade aos jogadores. Ao criar um personagem, você tem uma série de quests que devem ser seguidas sob uma história modelo, dividida em dez atos e em duas partes. Ao finalizar a primeira parte da história, você parte para a segunda, com uma dificuldade maior, já que você recebe algumas penalidades.

Terminada a parte da história e com seu personagem por volta do level 60 (level 100 sendo o máximo), você parte então para o conteúdo end-game do jogo, que consiste, na maior parte do tempo, 'rodar' mapas (mais de 100 tipos diferentes) em dificuldades diferentes em busca de mais level e/ou itens raros e ajudar Zana, uma NPC, na guerra do atlas. É aí que o grinding se torna interessante para pessoas que gostam (como eu). Para as que não gostam, você pode simplesmente começar de novo se quiser e tentar novas e divertidas builds.

Para se ter uma ideia dos níveis de grinding do jogo, estima-se que a possibilidade de dropar um dos itens mais raros do jogo (Espelho de Kalandra) seja de uma vez a cada dez anos se você jogar cerca de 4 horas por dia. É bastante, de fato, mas seu alto valor no jogo faz com que todos sonhem com a possibilidade de tornarem-se ricos da noite pro dia.

Os servidores são divididos em ligas. Há a liga permanente softcore e a permanente hardcore. A diferença entre uma e outra consiste no fato de que, se você morrer com seu personagem na liga hardcore, ele será automaticamente transferido para a liga softcore (ao contrário de Diablo, onde você perde o personagem).

Há também as ligas temporárias, normalmente lançadas a cada 2 ou 3 meses. Elas oferecem um ""fresh start"", ou seja, um início fresco para aqueles que não querem se submeter à inflacionada economia das ligas permanentes ou simplesmente desejam tentar se perpetuarem como ricos comerciantes ou crafters de itens nas novas ligas. Note que, ao final de cada liga, seus personagens lá localizados, bem como o baú da sua conta, serão transferidos para as ligas permanentes.

[h1]Gráficos[/h1]
Além do que pode se ver nas próprias imagens, Path of Exile não é um jogo que possa se dizer ser muito voltado ao desenvolvimento de belos gráficos. Os gráficos são sim medianos, mas mantém-se sempre atualizados com o que há de moderno no mundo dos jogos. Há cerca de um ano, como já mencionado, o jogo recebeu suporte a DirectX 11, além de alguns efeitos especiais a mais (como o movimento responsivo de capas e asas de personagens a skills ou até mesmo o vento). Na mesma época o jogo também recebeu portabilidade para o Xbox.

Sua customização visual também não é muito rica (por enquanto), sendo você, na maior parte do tempo, obrigado a ficar preso ao visual de seus itens e de sua raça (não há diferença de sexos, por exemplo - se você escolher raça X onde o personagem é, por padrão, feminino, ele continuará sendo feminino). Toda e qualquer customização visual não padrão, ou seja, que não é próprio do item que você esteja usando, é paga. A única exceção são as recompensas fornecidas no final de cada liga. Apesar disso, no último ano, a GGG tem investido bastante nesse quesito, com uma notável melhora.

O jogo tem atenção exclusiva da Grinding Gear Games, sua empresa gerenciadora. Com um início difícil de 5 funcionários, ela hoje conta com mais de 150 pessoas em dedicação exclusiva, fazendo com que seu suporte seja um dos mais efetivos que eu já tenha visto (enviei cerca de 10 a 15 tickets e a média de tempo para resposta deles foi de 5 minutos - é incrível).

[h1]Comunidade[/h1]
Você pode escolher interagir com a comunidade ou não. Esse é o principal fator que faz com que Path of Exile não seja, per-se, um MMORPG, onde, por definição, você é obrigado a interagir com um universo de jogadores. No geral, a comunidade de Path of Exile é bastante amigável e disposta a ajudar, mas, como em todo jogo, há bastantes trolls e, principalmente, scammers.

O [i]scam[/i] é legalizado no jogo desde que não seja através de transações da vida real (ou RMT - do inglês, [i]real money trading[/i]). De acordo com o próprio Chris Wilson, a empresa tenta não realizar nenhum tipo de regulação do mercado dentro do jogo, logo cabe a cada jogador tomar conta de seus itens e analisar seu devido valor antes de se desfazer dele para outro jogador. Ainda segundo ele, no jogo, [i]'knowledge is power, and power is everything'[/i] (conhecimento é poder, e poder é tudo).

No começo, não foram poucas as vezes que fui enganado por jogadores mais experientes, comprando a preço de banana mercadorias que poderiam valer bem mais caso eu soubesse seu devido valor, por isso recomendo cautela a jogadores novatos.

[h1]Pay-to-win?[/h1]
[b]Não.[/b] Não há sequer um fator que possa ser considerado pay-to-win em todo o jogo. Tudo que é adquirido por dinheiro real é por mero conceito de embelezamento e/ou [i]status quo[/i]. O único fator que possa ser considerado pay-to-win para alguns jogadores (eu não considero, no entanto) é o fato de que, ao criar uma nova conta, você recebe gratuitamente 3 abas no baú e para adquirir mais abas você deve dispor de dinheiro real.

No entanto, é bem comum o conceito de [i]mules[/i] no jogo, onde você cria vários personagens (você pode criar mais de 20 ao todo) para guardar itens dentro de seus inventários, o que não faz com que seja um fator limitante aos jogadores que não desejam pagar por conteúdo dentro do jogo.

[h1]Conclusão[/h1]
Path of Exile é uma obra-prima dos action-RPGs onlines. Sem dúvida o melhor do gênero, com a melhor companhia de jogos existente da atualidade em sua direção, mas eu, obviamente, sou suspeito a falar, já que ""desperdicei"" (e com orgulho) mais de 3000 horas da minha vida no jogo. Se você gosta de jogos com bastante [i]grinding[/i] e com uma grande gama de possibilidades de ações, sugiro que teste Path of Exile.

[h1]Nota: 9.5/10[/h1]
Pontos positivos:
[+] Grinding complexo
[+] Grande gama de possibilidades
[+] Árvore de habilidades com mais de 1300 opções
[+] Ligas que oferecem um começo igual a todos

Pontos negativos:
[-] Baixa gama de customização visual (mas que tem melhorado no último ano) | Yoa so nach knapp 4k std. Spielzeit kann ich wohl mal ein Review verfassen :P.

F2P oder P2W ? => Es ist wirklich F2P, man kann alle Charaktäre Fähigkeiten etc verwenden und ausspielen, es gibt kein EXP Boost oder ähnliches.

Wie finanziert sich die Firma hinter dem Spiel ? => MTX ähnlich wie in Dota gibt es Armor, Waffen und Fähigkeits ""Skins"" welche das Spiel selber aber nicht beeinflussen. 

Also muss man kein Geld ausgeben ? 
=> Jaein xD, wenn man sehr viel spielt und einem das Spiel nun wirklich gefällt sollte man seinen Stash(Truhe) erweitern, hier nimmt man dann mal 20€ in die Hand (wenn dir dieses Spiel keine 20€ wert ist dann lass es halt ^^), für dieses Spiel allerdings noch zu wenig bei dem was es dir bietet. 
Ich persönlich spiel das Spiel seit der closed Beta(2013) und habe zu jedem kostenlosen DLC ( ein DLC bietet ca so viel Umfang wie Diablo III insgesamt, es gibt bereits 5 DLC´s) der Firma GrindingGearGames etwas Geld zukommen lassen und hab mir davon Stash Erweiterungen und Skins gekauft.

Ist es Einsteiger freundlich ? 
=> Auch hier ein Jaein, wer bereits viele Action RPG`s gezockt hat wird etwas schneller ins Spiel finden, wer keine Erfahrungen hat wird es sehr schwer haben aber gut Ding will Weile haben :P.
Also einfach Google nutzen und man wird schnell merken das die PoE Community ins gesamt nett und freundlich ist und es gibt ne menge Anfänger guides von größeren Streamern. Hier und da sollte man also bei Twitch.tv sich Builds in Action ansehen oder im Forum einen Build heraussuchen ;).
Und lasst euch nicht vom Skill Baum abschrecken, man wird diesen lieben wenn man das Spiel mehr und mehr versteht, genau dieser bietet einen unglaubliche Freiheiten seinen Charakter einzigartig zu machen und evtl. einen wirklich guten Build zu erstellen.

Ist es auf deutsch spielbar ?
=> JA!!!!, es ist nun möglich es auf DEUTSCH zu stellen !!!!! ;-)  

Diablo III oder POE ?
=> Ich spiele beides, aber PoE bietet sag ich mal 10x so viel und ist F2P , auch grafisch mag ich PoE mehr da es düsterer, brutaler und gnadenloser ist.

Gibt es einen Harcore Modus ?
=> Ja, der gestorbene Charakter landet in Sofcore. Anders als in Diablo III gibt es keine passive Fähigkeit die dich retten kann.

Ist die Story gut erzählt ?
=>Nein, keine tollen Videos und auch kaum Vertonung, der Fokus lag wie es richtig ist, auf dem Gameplay, aber mitlerweile wird mehr und mehr vertont und nachgebessert.

Gibt es ein Late-Game ?
=> Ja und zwar ein absolut geaniales Late-Game !, mit lvl 60 ist man ca. fertig mit der Story welche man 3mal durchpielt (Normal,Cruel,Merciless), nach einiger Erfahrung geht das ziemlich schnell. Im Late-Game läuft man Maps welche durch Portale geöffnet werden und zufällig generiert werden, der Name der Map gibt einem Info darüber wie das Layout ca aussehen wird und welcher Boss auf einem wartet, auch hier die PoE wiki nutzen oder Ytube Videos schauen wie der Boss Fight ablaufen wird.

Gibt es einen Trade Markt wo Spieler untereinander handeln ?
=> JA, es gibt kein Gold oder ähnliches, im Spiel findet man Orbs welche zu Iteam craften genutzt werden können oder auch als Währung, dabei sind diese aufgrund ihrer verschiedenen Seltenheit unterschiedlich viel Wert, am Ende ist es ehher ein tausch System, ich gebe dir ``x`` von und du gibst mir deine Armor.
 
Am Ende kann ich nur sagen das es sich hier um ein Spiel handelt, für welches man viel Zeit haben sollte, der Anfang wird sehr schwer sein da es sehr viele Meschaniken gibt, wenn du also ein Spiel suchst an dem du dich messen kannst und dich frei entwickeln kannst bist du bei PoE genau richtig.

Hier noch ein paar links zu Seiten dich euch sicher weiter helfen werden ;)

http://www.pathofexile.com/forum <--- zum Build heraus suchen unter Classes / Builds

www.twitch.tv <--- hier einfach mal Builds live in Action anschauen und evtl Leute im Chat um Hilfe bitten, wie gesagt ist der große Teil der Community sehr nett, liegt vermutlich daran das es nicht competitive ist ^^.

MfG Schlomo und viel Spaß beim spielen !!!! | La verdad es que era bastante reticente a probar este juego. En primer lugar, no me gustan los ""free2play"". Suelen acabar en ""pay 2 win"", comunidades tóxicas, DLCs sospechosamente obligatorios, y una calidad general bastante baja. Además, tengo todos los Diablo comprados, desde el I al III con todas sus expansiones. Teniendo el original, ¿para que jugar a un clon? 

Pues Path of Exile me ha sorprendido. 

En primer lugar, en la tienda del juego sólo venden objetos cosméticos, espacio de almacenamiento, y packs de soporte. Nada que afecte al desarrollo del personaje o al poder de los objetos.

En cuanto al desarrollo del personaje, el juego tiene 19 clases de partida. Pero no son clases cerradas, sino más bien ""zonas de inicio"" que puedes desarrollar a través de un árbol con cientos (literalmente) de skills pasivos. 

Tiene mucho contenido, diez actos. Muchas misiones secundarias, aleatorias, y tramas paralelas (maestros, refugio, etc...). Cada cierto tiempo abren una liga, en la que todos los jugadores empiezan de cero y hay algún evento específico.

La ambientación del mundo es muy siniestra, a ratos realmente gore. Me gusta la historia. Gráficamente no están mal, aunque no está a la altura de Diablo. 

El sistema de juego está lleno de buenas ideas. Por ejemplo, no hay habilidades activas, se consiguen a través de gemas que se engarzan en el equipo. Las gemas pueden subirse de nivel, y hasta hay gemas de soporte que potencian el efecto de otras gemas. 

Hay pociones, como en Diablo 2, pero se rellenan solas cuando matas enemigos, no tienes que llevar 500 pociones en el inventario.

Sistema de crafting básico y avanzado. Se pueden mejorar y alterar los objetos, reforjar estadísticas, etc...

En resumen, un ARPG hardcore, con una curva de aprendizaje un poco bestia al principio, pero con muchísimas posibilidades. Encima gratis y sin pay2win. No sé que más se puede pedir. | 
[h1]Seja bem-vindo, exilado![/h1]


Path of Exile é um RPG de ação 3D publicado pela Grinding Gear Games. Semelhante a jogos como Diablo e Torchlight, Path of Exile permite aos jogadores explorar vários calabouços (dungeons) nas formas de história ""Atos"". Os jogadores têm uma grande variedade de classes iniciais para escolher, mas cada classe serve apenas como o ponto de partida inicial para a progressão do personagem de um jogador.

Os jogadores têm a sua disponibilidade uma enorme quantidade de gemas (skill gems) e opções passivas da skill tree. As gemas podem ser encaixadas no equipamento do personagem e concedem uma escala larga das habilidades, que dependem do tipo e da cor da gema. As gemas podem até subir de nível para fornecer uma versão mais forte da skill. A árvore de habilidades é um conjunto vasto e complexo de combinações de skills passivas. Cada jogador pode escolher entre uma enorme variedade de alocações pontuais para realmente personalizar a sua classe de personagens.

Path of Exile apresenta tanto PvE e PvP com eventos como corridas de nivelamento que ocorrem em servidores dedicados. Outras variações incluem um modo Cut-Throat, onde os jogadores podem invadir instâncias de outros jogadores e matá-los para levar seus itens. Cada evento pode durar de apenas uma hora a vários meses e premiar valiosos prêmios para os vencedores. Os fãs da mecânica de rastreamento de dungeons (*dungeon crawling) mais tradicionais encontrados no Diablo 2 devem definitivamente dar uma chance ao Path of Exile.

*Sistema [b]dungeon crawling[/b]:

O sistema de [b]dungeon crawling[/b] é um tipo de cenário em jogos de role-playing de fantasia em que os heróis navegam em um ambiente labiríntico, lutando contra vários monstros e saqueando qualquer tesouro que possam encontrar. Devido à sua simplicidade, o dungeon crawling pode ser mais fácil para um *gamemaster executar do que aventuras mais complexas, e o estilo de ""hack and slash"" é apreciado por jogadores que se concentram em ação e combate.

*Um [b]gamemaster[/b] ( GM , também conhecido como mestre de jogo , gerente de jogo , moderador de jogo ou árbitro ) é uma pessoa que atua como um organizador, oficiante para perguntas sobre regras, arbitragem para um jogo de RPG multiplayer .Eles são mais comuns em jogos cooperativos em que os jogadores trabalham juntos do que em jogos competitivos em que os jogadores se opõem uns aos outros. O ato realizado por um gamemaster é às vezes referido como ""Gamemastering"" ou simplesmente ""GM-ing"".
O papel básico do gamemaster é o mesmo em quase todos os jogos tradicionais de role-playing, embora diferentes conjuntos de regras tornam os deveres específicos do gamemaster exclusivo para esse sistema.

[b]Prós:[/b]

-Bons gráficos que trabalham mesmo em PCs low-end, efeitos sonoros de alta fidelidade.
-Boa história
-Ambientação e efeitos bem elaborados, ótimo final.
-Totalmente free to play.
-Se você decidir investir dinheiro, todos os preços estão bem equilibrados.
-Muitos itens
-Cópia fiel ao Diablo 2
-Skill tree avançada 

[b]Contras:[/b]

-Alguns problemas de atraso e desconexões aleatórias, Não posso dizer que é perfeito, mas eu jogo tranquilamente com ping bem baixo. Porém, vejo algumas pessoas com problemas de vez em quando.
-Pontos de controle são muito distantes, por esse motivo o jogador tem que correr para o objetivo com a necessidade de perder alguns minutos em vez de usar o teleporte para checkpoints, que são muito longes do objetivo da missão.
- Customizaçao de personagens.


Lendo o site ficou claro que foi produzido de fã para fãs, devido a frases como:

[i] - ""Totalmente gratuito e nunca será pay to win""
- ""Estamos cansados da moda de fadas e luzes, Path Of Exile é realístico e escuro""[/i] 
E muitas outras...

Path Of Exile está de parabéns e merece respeito já por isto, recomendo para jogadores assíduos e que veneram o estilo Old School.


[b]Nota final 8/10.[/b]

 | Первый обзор, постараюсь кратко и со смыслом.

Отличный аналог Диабло, не могу сказать что он лучше или хуже, но для проекта, который создавался на минимум бюджета, оооочень недурственно. 
  Из плюсов: 
- Очень улыбнула графика. Она выдержана в своем стиле, сразу переносишься во времена Diablo2, когда было все ради фана и атмосферы.
- Для небольшого количества героев, просто огромный выбор классов. Благодаря системе развития пассивных навыков, это просто надо увидеть и попробовать, лично я остался под огромным впечатлением. Можно конечно канониченых магов, лучников и варов делать, но так же невесело. +)
- Понравился сюжетный режим. Несомненный плюс в прохождении с друзьями, опять таки за счет того, что билды героев нестандартны и очень вариотивны. Можно творить все, что вздумается, а это большая редкость для РПГ.
- Система активных скилов и крафта выполнена на высоте. Аналогов я просто не встречал, просто один раз попробовать и самому увидеть лучше, чем сто раз прочитать любой из обзоров.
  Из минусов:
- Лично для меня из минусов стала мини карта и ее большой брат, очень тускло, постоянно режет глаза. Но на это можно забить большой болт. Лично мое мнение.
- Есть еще один момент, касаемо новичков. Придется много читать статей и гайдов по героям, ибо настает момент, когда Вы попросту можете дальше не пройти из-за своего билда, нестандартаня раскачка весло, но может стать занозой в ягодной части при прохождении в соло. Опять таки может это у меня руки кривые, а у Вас все получится. +)

По итогу. В PoE обязательно стоит попробовать полиграть всем ценителям РПГ жанра, я уверяю тебя уважаемый читатель, равнодушным проект не оставит, хоть сначала может показаться странным и тяжеловатым. Но. Оно того определенно стоит. Ни разу не пожалел проведенного времени, жаль мало набегал, ибо все время свободное отнимает КС.

I really like this game because of all of it's action and stratagy that 
you have to involve in it and im not saying it's perfect. In act 1 you 
can get a free dragon after beating and theres up to act 3 right now 
and it involves a really cool story line sounds cool right, guess again. 

you have to pay for the other act's and a lot of the things you can buy 
with real money and or game money is kind of overpriced in my opinion 
because you only get 100 money per victory and it cost's 5000 for three 
random dragon eggs and 2500 for a new weapon, there is interesting runes
too and you can upgrade your weapens at the forge with stuff you find in
battle or pay for wich is the only cheap thing in my opinion. 

Other than that this game is amazing you really have to work with your team 
in battle to cover everything and it's still preatty difficult ven if you
have 5 ppeople in skype. you also get this portrait of a dragon and when

I would say my actual hours are probably closer to 2000. this is a huge, well established MMO with tons of content. if you like customized builds, look no further. you have the ability to create your character from the ground up. you choose where every ability, skill, feat and enhancement point goes, and you can even multiclass. ever wondered how an Archer Monk Wizard would fare in combat? Now you can find out. 

Quests are anything but the repetitive ""find 12 of this"". most quests have you go through intricate dungeons that have puzzle solving and traps and interesting story lines. while the game is less biased to balanced parties than it used to be, you will certainly reap rewards by teaming up with friends or other players although solo play is quite viable. 

The game is nearly infinite in how playable it is. once you reach max level you have a variety of options that allow you to continue improving your character by ""reincarnating"" back to a lower level, different class, etc in exchange for more feats, enhancements and ability points. as I mentioned earlier there is also a massive amount of quests and content to go through, and the devs regularly come out with more.

The game is free to play and I would say it is fairly free to play. expansion packs are the only things you have to purchase with real money (if you want them) other than that all the quest packs and quality of life items can be purchased through in game points that you gain from completing quests. I am very much against the pay to win trend you see in alot of f2p games and even paid games these days however this game is not one of those. if you get serious about the game you probably will put real money into it in order to buy the expansions or pick up some of the adventure packs you don't want to grind for but there are no lootboxes or gambling and everything is reasonably priced. Getting to max level as well as getting good gear is very achievable without paying anything. out of all the games I have spent time on, I would say this has actually been one of the least expensive when I compare how much enjoyment I have gotten out of it over time. If you are into MMOs and like excellent fantasy lore, challenging dungeons, highly customized characters and don't want to spend alot of $$$ for a full gaming experience, I would highly reccomend dungeons and dragons online. | This is one of the old school grouping favored MMOs that well, we just don't see anymore. This is not your World of Warcraft aka: Forever Quest for +Gooder items.  Items are meaningful, the world is huge and its D&D.

Pros:
Old School feel
Grouping encouraged and easy
D&D 3.5
Traps matter
Excellent itemization
Excellent character building
Big Huge World with tons of content
Lot's of free content

Cons: 
Graphics a bit dated in some areas

The store is not pay to win, but can be costly. | I've played this for years and still have a lot of fun. New expansions and content constantly increase the play and variety. While a lot of content requires purchase or subscription, you can also earn points from playing that will allow you to purchase that same content. Admitedly the totally free route is much more of a grind, so you may find you want to purchase or subscribe for convenience. Overall a beautiful full 3D game, with movement in all directions including high altitudes and deep pits and water you have to swim through. There is day, night, rain, sunshine, multiple moons moving across the sky and beautiful sunsets. And yes, there be dragons too! There are a lot of areas, but you seldom have to run too far as there are telporters and guild ship docks all around to move you quickly to the various regions. Choose the difficulty that makes your play the most fun while still challenging - casual, normal, hard, elite and the new ""reaper"" mode. Many in-game Guilds welcome players - players' ""renown"" build up the guild and your character receives numerous buffs as the guild level increases. A rather unique feature in DDO is the ability to reincarnate. Tired of your current capped build? Have it start again from level 1, but stronger and better each time you reincarnate. While DDO characters only have 30 levels there are 5 sub-levels within each level. Each of these sub-levels or Action Points are roughly equivalent to a level in other MMOs, so it's comparable to 150 levels in other games. There are hundreds of quests to play either on your own, with your friends, with potential new friends, or even purchase an AI hirling to help out. The game starts in the D&D Eberron world, but has expansions to Forgotten Realms and soon Ravenloft. There are also questpacks for D&D modules Against the Slave Lords, Temple of Elemental Evil and Haunted Halls of Eveningstar. Normal quests have up to 6 players and raids have up to 12 players. There are so many ways to customize your character, You can even take multiple classes and try to combine benefits from both. But it's also fairly forgiving and if you make mistakes you can adjust the difficulty, rebuild your character or just wait and reincarnate into a better version. While the game has a lot of features, is very ""learn as you go"" and you don't have to do everything. E.g. Craft it you want or skip it altogether. Most of all I simply enjoy playing and experiencing the various worlds within the game. | Introduction;

I have spent many hours on this game over the years, and even though it may feel a little antiquated now, it is still one of the best RPG's that I have played in a very long time.

It feels like a true RPG, and a true adaptation of the AD&D Rule Set that true AD&D gamers are familiar with.  There is none of that level scaling crap in this game which has become a trend recently.  It is all leveled content.

This is one of the few games which I install every time I have to do a re-install of Steam for what ever reason.


The Game;


The world is huge, to be frank.  AD&D has access to areas of the Forgotten Realms region that, I assume most of us are familiar with, as well as the main city hub of Stormreach, and several huge explorer regions.  For instance, when you get into the Forgotten Realms Campeign setting, you gain access to Evening Star, and eventually gain the keys to the city. If you don't want to be there, then you can go to Stormreach, the Kings Forest, or even the Underdark.

The game has all of the usual enemies which you would associate with the AD&D world, including Dryads, Dire Bears, Kobolds, Druids, and Drow.  The enemies are plentiful, the loot is plentiful, and the traps which can be powerful enough to kill you in one shot, are also plentiful.  

It is a true AD&D game in every way.

The amount of loot that can be acquired from various quests is so expansive that I cannot list them all here, but there is everything from +5 Daggers, to +6 Docents, to +1 Kite Shields, to specific, named loot.  It turly is immense, and the amount of ways to get that loot is even more expansive especially considering the depth of the crafting system, and the wilderness areas which contain specific bosses who can be farmed for fat lewt.  On top of that, farmable item sets of great power can be farmed in Evening Star, simply by farming event tokens in the Kings Forest.  That only takes a few nights to get, and you are essentially fully geared.

The quests are plentiful for both groups, raids and solo players.  The main issue with that however, is that the servers can feel a little empty at the minute, but to help tackle this issue, the game does still receive constant new updates.  Later this year for instance (2017), the development team will be releasing the Ravenloft expansion pack.  Besides which, you can cut the need to do low level content out by purchasing the Shadowfell Conspiracy Expansion Pack and start from level 15 with a heroic class.  Furthermore, a lot of the content does not require a group, so there is nothing stopping you from playing solo, scene as every class has access to certain spell casting and healing items.  With all that said, the game is ageing well, for a 10 year old game.

The highlight of this entire game however, is the level of character customisation.  Every character can be specifically customised in a variety of ways, whether it is through the character generation screen when you first start, or through the epic destiny system, or the tallents trees.  

For instance I play a mage, that might sound boring at first, until you realize that I play a 20th level Eldritch Knight / Pale Master with 7 Epic Levels in Draconic Lineage.  That makes him one bad ass character in both melee and for spell casting.  The range of spells available are not only equal to anything in the original 2nd edition AD&D rule set, but also exceede it, because of these epic level spells and the abilities granted through the tallent trees.


Updates;


As I mentioned earlier, the game is constantly updated, and always in the right direction.  New raids, new quests, new player races are added, and a whole plethora of other things are usually added.  THERE IS NO NERFING which is important to mention, because the trend these days seems to be that if something is deemed too powerful, nerf it and that is usually your update in other games.  That doesn't happen in AD&D DDO.  Instead, we get new raids, new quests, new loot, new hero classes and races, in otherwords, content that we actually ask for.  It is all done right.  

I would highly recommend buying both of the available expansions packs however.  In particular, The Shadowfell Conspiracy DLC is well worth purchasing on F2P accounts.  If you plan to do some F2P gaming on DDO, especially as a solo player, without having to pay a subscription fee, buy that DLC pack before you do anything else.  I will tell you why below.

These are probably my two main gripes against the game.  

I don't like the fact that you may feel like you are forced to buy content packs to get the most out of the game if you don't want to subscribe to DDO, or want to treat DDO as entirely F2P, but you can work around this by buying the expansion packs instead.  

The only times that locked content may be a pain though, is if you are farming for specific loot, and that loot is only available in a certain part of the game world that you do not have access too, or when you may want to do a quest with your friends, and you don't have access to those quests because you haven't unlocked them.

My other gripe is that I really don't like how Spell Points are regenerated via Rest Shrines.  Rest Shrines can be used every 5 minutes, 15 minutes, or once only, depending on the difficulty setting.  This isn't a problem really for classes who don't use spells, but since many of us do, SP management becomes critical, and that is also the chief reason why I chose to play an Eldritch Knight.  Even when my toon runs out of SP, he can still go melee.  The SP elixers should also drop much, much more frequently in game, and I don't think that they should be listed on the store in all honesty.  Selling Spell Point recovery pots may be seen P2W, and may put potential new players off DDO.


Subbing Vs F2P.


don't bother subbing over a long period of time, it is not worth it.  The only real benefit to subbing is the ""free"" DDO store points that you get each month.  

There is a better, cheaper way to unlock most of the games content on F2P accounts, wihtout ever having to pay a subscription fee;

1:  Buy the Shadowfell Conspiracy Pack.  This will unlock a shit load of content and allow you to start from level 15, as a heroic class character.  This will also make a lot of the lower level, locked content worthless.

2:  Buy the Menace of the Underdark Pack.  This will unlock the Forgotten Realms setting as well as the Drow Race and Druid Class, and give you a permanent xp boost for your account.

3:  Use any store points given to buy the ""Hall of Heroes pass"" so that you can transfer between Eberon and Eveningstar without having to fight Lolth on a new toon each time.

Subbing for a year would cost well over $100.  Buying both of the expansion packs and the Hall of Heroes Pass costs around $50 and you will unlock a lot of the base games content.  you then have access to that content forever, without ever having to pay a subscription fee and can start a new toon at level 15, with access to those campeign settings instantly, forever.  


Conclusion.


I can whole heartedly recommend this game at the minute.  I am slightly nervous because news broke recently that the Development Team were teaming up with Daybreak Studios, which is a bad sign in my book, but still, I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, for now simply because I enjoy this game so much.  

IF DAYBREAK do anything to harm the success and longevity of this game, I will never have anything good to say about that business again, and I will probably hate them until the end of my days.

For now, I will continue to actively support this game, and I do plan to buy the Ravenloft Expansion pack later this year, if for no other reason than the goodies it should contain.  Hopefully, aside from the new content, it will include new heroic races, Experince Tomes, and DDO points.  

We shall have to wait and see though, how well this unholy alliance with Daybreak plays out. | In short: 
I strongly recommend this game WITH 2-4 friends in tow. Otherwise, given the current state of the community, I strongly recommend against it!

Note:
Some folks are having problems with becoming a subscriber or purchasing in the market. This is a problem with the Steam launcher. To circumvent, you need to go to your Steam folder ...\steamapps\common\Dungeons and Dragons Online\ and run TurbineLauncher.exe.


The long version:
I had thousands of hours of gameplay prior to acquiring on Steam. I have recently returned to check it out.

DDO, iirc, was the first Western mmo to go f2p-microtransactional. With Daybreak Games acquiring publishing rights recently, it's unclear how bad microtransactions will become. The claim is that DBG won't have undue influence, but this could easily be pushed into the P2W zone.

That said, DDO remains the ""unique"" mmorpg out there. Nuts-and-bolts it was built with grouping, suspense, problem solving, humor, quirkiness and discovery in mind, rather than grind or plain action. In its prime, it had 4 core group roles, with a nod to a fith: tank, healer, dps, trapper and a lil' bit control. The trapper was essential for finding and disarming invisible traps and unlocking key doors.

For newcomers who find a balanced and patient/dungeon-crawl group, the experience is unparalleled. DM narration, complex dungeon/mission mechanics (vs simple boss scripting), puzzles, and slower pacing really do rival your most acute PNP nostalgia.

Like all mmorpg's, however, the dev team has allowed this to degrade into solo'able content, or dps biased grouping. But unlike other mmo's, the original experience is still viable and worthwhile!

The graphics aren't 'modern,' but they have always had an ineffible charm."

1、共同回合的机制。对战双方同时执行自己的回合，然后统一结算。富有战略性，能体验运筹帷幄的快乐。
2、对战区域的划分。包括进攻区域、防守区域、支援区域、指挥官区域，以及由它们组成的概念：被部署区域、战场。区域的划分和不同区域特定的功能大大扩展了对战策略的可能性。
3、卡组机制。组成套牌前对势力的选择决定了你整个套牌的风格和可利用的资源，要求玩家不断取舍，最终完成自己喜欢的战术。
4、比较轻松的游戏体验。不需要大量的时间、精力和金钱投入。
当你在了解了整个游戏从确立思路、组建套牌到最终随机应变取得胜利之后，游戏的体验会相当不错。然而这款游戏的诸多缺点也就来源于玩家这个熟悉过程之前。
1、中文翻译不完整，概念解释缺失。游戏初期有诸多不加解释的概念，严重影响玩家融入游戏。包括组建套牌时的规则不明确，会让新手玩家摸不着头脑。
2、糟糕的网络连接。较差的网络环境甚至不能让你完整体验一场游戏。
3、UI（交互界面元素）设计不合理，拥有较多生物时会拥挤，难以精确操作。画面特效单一。
当玩家熟悉了这些之后，我仍然认为这款游戏值得喜爱卡牌游戏的玩家尝试一下。同时也希望官方能加紧改正上述缺点（如果可能的话）
希望我的体验能帮到大家，祝大家游戏愉快。
 | É um jogo de cartas animado em que você coloca diversas criaturas para duelar em seu nome. São vários adversários em uma campanha longa, que passa por diversos lugares e enfrenta desafiantes poderosos e repletos de recursos para frear a sua jornada.
Jogo bom, porém algumas funções meia confusas. | 粗略玩了一下.简单地来说一说自己的观点.
优点:
1.相较于其他卡牌游戏,双方同时执行回合的玩法增加了游戏的战略性
2.每个种族的特性较为鲜明
3.场地被划分为3块(支援区,进攻区,防守区)的玩法也增加了游戏的战略性

缺点:
1.每个玩家虽然拥有两种血量,但其实第二种血量(士气)基本只是为了龙族之裔的削士气战术单独服务.95%的时候士气都是多余的.作为游戏中的重要参数之一,略显累赘
2.卡牌技能介绍做地非常差,是我玩过的所有卡牌游戏中最差的一款,这足以成为让新人弃坑的原因.举例:人族某卡被部属在进攻区域后会拥有坚不可摧特性,至于坚不可摧是什么,我翻遍了游戏都没找到解释.也许是不受战斗伤害,也许是不会受到伤害,也许就是无敌.同上还有超载X,激怒X,虚弱X,生命X等
3.游戏的卡包过多,而且无法得知卡包内所包含的所有卡.只能通过牌组中浏览所有卡来逆向搜索自己想要的卡所在的卡包.
4.卡片虽然可以交易,但是与此同时也少了拆分合成功能.低稀有度卡极易数量溢出.且对于独狼玩家来说伤害巨大.
5.牌组组合界面操作相当难受,你能同时浏览到的牌只有一行约10张.而滚动牌堆时的操作惯性相当违和,稍微滚动一点只能翻过几张,而再稍微多滚动一点则是会一口气翻过去很多张.与此同时,当你想把牌加入指挥官位置时,如果放置位置不当,就会把所有同名卡全部移除牌组,然后你又不得不自己一张一张加回来.
6.游戏技巧需要玩家自己挖掘,战斗前的读取界面没有实用的小提示.举例:一般卡片的牌组数量限制为3,被加入到指挥官位置的卡不会被算入卡组数量限制.即,一张数量限制为3的卡最多可以在牌组中添加6张(指挥官位置X3+牌组X3).
7.游戏系统极其难受,当你在场上拥有大量单位以后,他们将在区域里挤成一团.而如果你想拉动他们到其他区域,你需要极其小心且不得不一张一张地拉动它们,假如你还想将他们的位置顺序交换,你还得再小心翼翼地拉动它们.整个过程对操作的精度要求比较高,至少不像是从手牌拍怪那样按住鼠标往上甩就好了.

虽然我列举的缺点比优点多很多,而且也不推荐这款游戏.但是我还是比较喜欢这款游戏的.优点虽然少,但是核心玩法还是可圈可点的.而且缺点大部分也不会经常经历.

至于不推荐的理由:
1.这款游戏不适合入门级卡牌游戏玩家以及欠缺耐心和金钱的玩家.游戏已经开服很久了,对于现在入坑的玩家来说,要补的卡包数量相当可观.而且由于没有卡片拆分合成系统.要不氪金完全组出自己的牌组需要以月为单位来积累.当然你能找到大佬免费送你卡当我没说.
2.2014年9月5日发行的游戏,我今天2017年2月12日刚玩了8.1个小时(通完剧情,教程,挑战,打了盘竞技场,开玩送的卡包,又自己买了一包开,自己组了一套牌组)就能发现游戏还有那么多不方便的地方,其中几个地方还令人发指(战斗时卡片聚堆)这让我对游戏开发商的态度以及能力表示怀疑. | wonderful game, can't understand all the hate is receiving. It's fun and entertaining, a perfect way to spend an hour or two in front of the pc. 

To the devs: please fix the japanese faction (you know, the green one based on morale ) because they're absolute trash right now, lol. | I have not played the remake of this game recently, but one big reason, and I hope the creators stop going down this path:

They've split their already small cult following into 3 by publishing 3 similar games with the same IP and similar gameplay. Not sure what the goal of that was, when their player base is already fairly small, because it's going to make me and others reluctant to invest in Infinity Wars Classic if it's going to be replaced by Infinity Wars 2 in the future. They really need to combine the games back into one, focus on it, and make it hit critical mass so that players can actually start recommending it to their friends.

EDIT: Thanks for the explanation! This makes more sense than what I had originally understood, so I've updated the review accordingly.

I will say that while I still have some doubts, the game design of Infinity Wars is honestly a masterpiece, it solves all the problems I've had with other online card games (like Hearthstone/MTGO) in the past. I'll highlight the two biggest points which I think other online card games got wrong.

Firstly, there's actual trading, and it doesn't feel like MTGO where it feels like you're trading with a stock market because there's thousands of copies of each card. It feels much more like going to a card game store and trading with friends, because there's multiple different rarities which make the more rare card+rarity combinations rare enough that they feel unique. This means that people will haggle, or look around to find someone who has that one card they've been looking for. Feels very much like trading in-person.

Secondly, it removes the RNG aspect of mana-based card games in the early game. Games with lands like MTG and Eternal suffer from mana flood/drought, which adds an unnecessary and un-fun element of RNG to the game. However, even Hearthstone which does not have lands, suffers from early game RNG because drawing cards on curve is extremely important to surviving/winning the early game, and makes early game much more RNG dependent than lategame. This game fixes both problems by having automatic mana increases like Hearthstone, but also giving you a choice of 3 Commanders which you can choose during deck-building to start every game with. This lets you pick defensive early game, and scaling options as a control deck, so you don't end up skipping your first 4 turns like other card games, and high tempo high power cards for aggro decks, so you don't feel like you just fall behind early game and have no hope because of a bad draw.

This review may have become very long, but it's because I honestly believe Infinity Wars is the best designed card game out there, and as long as they can get the UI/marketing done right, it will be a huge hit in my opinion."

The %of hitting and missing is way off.  It's incredibly common to miss with a 99% change to hit.  One battle I missed 3x in a row.  Anything below 70% is almost a guaranteed miss.

It is turn based and linear; you go out on missions, then return to your home to level up, re-supply, pick up side missions, and progress the story.

At first I was disappointed, but the story and atmosphere sucked me in.

Their are 5 races (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Orc, and Troll) and 6 classes (Samurai, Mage, Decker, Rigger, Shaman, Physical Adept) but racial limits on attributes and skills are disappointingly limited. There's no point in making a troll as anything other than a Samurai or Physical Adept, for example, as their racial limits would prevent any other class' skills rising above 6 points (out of 15)

The games also have fan-made campaigns available in the Steam community

Just about everything I like about its foundation is still there; it's a survival crafting game that manages to be fully voxel-based and destructible without looking the part, with an emphasis less on exploring randomly generated terrain and more on exploring structures that are randomly placed but hand-made, with each one feeling like a fun mini-dungeon hiding its own little surprises. There's plenty of content, plenty to build, and it lasts a long time before getting old. I spent a long time playing it via gamepass before coming back to put 50 more hours into it with my usual group for 1.0, and we had a good time doing it. But by the end of it, we all had our own complaints as well. The problem with the 1.0 changes aren't that they ruined the game, so much as that they change it ever so slightly into a different type of game than the one we came to it for; it's like right at the end of development someone on the team played an ARPG and had an epiphany. 

Most of the changes feel like they were made for people who have been playing the game for thousands of hours and just want to grind efficiently, rather than new players just wanting to explore and play the game with fresh eyes. A minor example of this is the trader system; in the previous versions, any of the game's different vendors could show up anywhere, and it was possible to get lucky and find towns with two different ones in the area. In 1.0 we eventually moved into a town that had three traders, which was pretty exciting until I realized they were all Trader Hugh (sorry, Hugh) because of them being made biome-specific. You can obviously guess why they did this. For people who already know the game and just want to get going, it takes a lot of the guess work out of finding a trader of a certain type they might need to start optimally instead of having to wander for ages looking for one with a bit of bad luck. But for normal people, those sorts of experiences are practically a cornerstone of the genre; survival crafting games are all about generating funny stories caused by the randomness, and I feel like probably everyone that's ever played one has at least one memory of searching for ages for something and how good it felt when they finally stumbled across it or finding something they didn't even know was in the game after finishing it multiple times. Yeah, it can be frustrating in the moment, but that's why it's called ""survival"" crafting, not vacation crafting. Get real, man.

The last time I played this game, there was a clothing system that, while not necessarily robust, had a nice amount of variety, as well as minor gameplay elements. You could loot funny hats and put together outfits, customize your character's looks without worrying about stats, and dress for the weather. This has all been replaced with various sets of armor and a promise of re-adding it about a year later. You can still mix and match pieces of armor, and in some ways it can even be preferable with their individual effects, but each set also has a set bonus that encourages you to just wear a full set instead of dressing up the way you want to. Some of the funny items like cigars are still in the game, but only as accessories you equip to your gear with no visual change. And that's adequate -- at least there are still options, and while I wish there were more armor sets they at least look pretty unique -- but it just feels arbitrary, even mechanically. If you went into a snow biome from the start before, your character would end up freezing pretty quickly if you didn't have warm clothes to layer up with, and my first memory of such a thing was spending a night huddled by a campfire in a house surrounded by bears. Which is fun! I love having moments like those in these games. I went there in 1.0 fairly early on expecting to relive the memory, and found that because I had crafted basically any armor set at all I was already above the threshold of the weather doing anything more than a very minor stamina debuff. Why even bother?

But the thing that pisses me off the most is that despite its stat focus, the last time I played the game it did a good job of keeping the progression separate from the gameplay, so that you could comfortably specialize no matter what you chose to do as long as you were killing zombies and generally doing something. There were books you could find that gave unique and fun bonus traits, which are still there, but for the most part you were free to do whatever you wanted without feeling like you were lagging behind anyone you were playing with. In the current build, the entire system has been changed so that nothing really matters except the magazines you've read. Want to make better guns? Read 100 handgun magazines. Want to make better clothes? Without reading 100 issues of Fashion Weekly? C'mon, let's be serious! Nearly every crafting skill in the game now has 100 arbitrary points you have to raise by reading that many magazines (yes, yes, give or take 20 or so if you wear the nerd outfit, sue me geeksquad), and it's as tiring as you'd expect. Unless, of course, you do quests -- which are now basically the only viable way to progress even remotely smoothly, because of how often they reward you with loot boxes full of an assortment of magazines that are usually guided to what you're trying to level. And this, hundreds of words later, is my core problem with the new update. It doesn't matter if you want to loot, if you want to farm, if you just want to kill zombies; if you're not doing quests, you will burn out of the game long before you finish any crafting tree, to the point that it feels actively detrimental to just go out and explore on your own. Even the vendors themselves have been heavily nerfed to the point that most of their inventory is completely arbitrary in favor of the things you can craft at a given time, with their only lingering purpose being selling junk and occasionally buying things you're just too lazy to go find. Which would be fine, if the trader didn't still constantly get hung up on sending you to the same three or four buildings per quest tier or try to send you to Tilted Towers 6,000 meters away if your towns don't generate just right.

I'm sure some poindexter with 10,000 hours in the game is going to come into my comments like ""erm, ackshually, the changes added a sense of balance that was greatly desired for the pvp experience"", to which I say come at me because I am simply morally superior and way cooler. And despite my complaints, I do still maintain that it is still fun. But the reason behind my great american novel is to give context for the bottom line: is it worth $45? No. I mean, I don't even have to think about it, honestly. When I bought it the game was $25, and I thought that was a fair price then and it's still a fair price now. $45 is frankly a crack pipe price for it in its current state, especially given that it rocketed up that $20 with no meaningful changes from the previous build. But they have a lengthy roadmap listing out things that should have been in anything called ""1.0"", like bringing back the wardrobe system, adding in bandits, and even story content and new quests, which all sound like excellent ideas. If those end up coming to pass and don't get stripped down after 10 more years of rebalancing then I think the current price tag would be more justified. For now, just wait for a sale and don't be afraid to look into a few mods. | I can't play this game anymore. I got no patiences for this. It seems like the game has gotten worst with every version released in the last 3 years. It seems like the developers look at what players are doing and then deem it exploitative or just don't like it in general and change it. To summarize it, they don't like how the players are playing their game and they want them to play it how they (devs) want them to play it.
We went from alpha 12 creating sand molds for glass jars to now as of b25, no glass jars or containers or anything and want you to die of thirst on day one. We use to build underground and be safe, devs didn't like that and now the zombies dig. We then built air forts or off-ground bases, devs didn't like that and added physics to the blocks and coded zombies to attack the nearest support pillar to force collapse.
You use to build a small structure or clear and rehab a point of interest as a starting base after scouting for ones with forges or being near water. Devs didn't like that and now Poi's are deadly, and sometimes spawn zoms inside after placing your land claim block or bedroll. They marketed the game as a crafting survival game, but now have made it difficult to build and craft and forces you to loot all the time. 
You use to eat once and drink 3-4 times a day, devs didn't like that and now You're constantly starving and thirsty all the time. In alpha 12, you use to read books to unlock crafting or recipes and magazines to increase skills, the devs didn't like that and thought a skill point system would be better. They took the book/mags out in alpha 13-18 then reintroduced it in 19 to co-exist with the skill-point system, but now in b25, you need the books and mags to level up for everything.
You use to heal up and regain stamina after eating or drinking, and now you just a weak ass bitch, since food doesn't recover as much health and water is sparse. They cut down or remove quite bit of assets and gameplay from the game to simplify it and I think that has detracted from the game from it's earlier versions.
Now the fun pimps don't like the stealth mechanic and have null and negate it in the latest version.
That's just a fraction of the evolving changes. The game used to be pretty fun to now being such a total grind and chore, that I can't even stand it for 30 minutes before I quit out. 

I know what you're thinking, I'm complaining about how hardcore and difficult then contradict myself with them simplifying crafting and assets. But if you ever play the earlier versions, it wasn't as much of chore then as more of a realism and understanding basic build process, and it was quite fun. There was more to do. Going ""oh I need sand and clay, I need a jar for the mold, I need a forge, some metal or an anvil"" and put it all together to get 5 glass jars. Then I need water, pot and campfire. It was all obtainable and you had to manage it and it made it felt like you were trying to survive. 

Now it's like, you have to loot and get lucky, Do about 30 hits on a tree, block or door and now you're thirsty because you've exhausted your stamina repeatedly, so don't run or swing your club and avoid zombies, and hope you find water. It's a walking simulator with a looting mechanic. That's just bad game design. 

The Fun Pimps are not so fun, I think they are pure masochists that enjoy C&B Torture and they are making this game for those that enjoy that type of fetish. | 新版本更新后联机总是出现各种各样的问题。每次和朋友玩都是为了连接服务器花大量时间，往往还没开始正式玩就累了。 | 毎日過ごす中でなんかこうゾンビ倒したいなぁ、拠点作りたいなぁって

In the case of Borderlands 2 developer Gearbox has decided to largely stick with what worked the first time around, while implementing a host of tweaks that make it an overall superior game. A few relatively minor complaints aside, Borderlands 2 improves not only the narrative, but almost every major game system. If you’ve been itching for a reason to jump back into the world of Pandora, Borderlands 2 provides a more than ample supply.The hook of Borderlands 2, the very reason that I found myself thinking about it when I worked or tried to fall asleep, is the loot. Guns, ammo, character skins, grenade mods, class mods -- there’s always something just a bit better, something you so desperately didn’t even know you needed until you found it in Borderlands 2. Just like Diablo or a number of other action RPGs, the hunt for loot becomes intoxicating because of the tiny rush you get each time a rare colored item spills out of a chest or is dropped by a recently slain enemy. Every firefight and intense boss battle becomes all the more rewarding, because, though you might die a few times and want to crush something near you in real life, it suddenly feels like everything is going to be OK when you’re blasting away enemies with a newly looted gun. | só tem gente perturbada, armas, violência, animais perigosos, uma milicia que quer controlar tudo, nenhum policial á vista e um ambiente inóspito a vida humana.

76561197976281073,259060,Dominions 4: Thrones of Ascension,34.55,"Indie, Strategy",0,"Just way too complicated for me - this game has gathered dust in my library for years because every time I've tried to play it I've just landed up scratching my head trying to understand what is going on - even a tutorial video on YouTube took like an hour just to get past some of the starting options, before even really getting into any game play.

Not helped by the fact that there doesn't seem to be a proper inbuilt tutorial (well there is in theory, but it directs me towards reading the manual and there is no on-screen help or tips that I can see). I like inbuilt tutorials because surely the people who developed the game should be best placed to tell us about all the mechanics and what is important, and if they don't see making the game comprehensible as being important then I'm kinda wondering why.

Within the game I just feel like there is too much stuff - do you want your pretender to be a dragon or a tree, what types of unit (of the many many types on offer) do you want to build, keeping in mind that they all have quite complicated stats and features, and it's not clear to me at all where I get things like research from etc - like I just don't understand at all the decisions I'm supposed to be making and I assume the only way to properly understand is to spend many many hours on Youtube tutorials and playing the game through repeatedly. I think that one thing which I feel makes it harder as a beginner is that many of these decisions feel quite drastic - i.e. having a large potential impact - it's not like choosing a civ which will be slightly better at tech, or slightly better with military, some of these feel like very fundamental and major choices and I don't really understand them or their potential impact later in the game at all.

I appreciate some people will read this and think I'm just lazy for not putting in more time to understand it properly but the simple reality is that I don't have the time or energy to understand something this complicated where the developers haven't really (in my view) made a bit more effort to ease me into it, with a proper tutorial and maybe a more user-friendly interface / hints, and some efforts to help me understand what the realistic impact of different decisions might be. I've played plenty of strategy games with various levels of complexity but for me this is complicated past the point where I feel like I will enjoy overall spending the time required to understand it. I have lot of other games in my library which I've played more (many of them cheaper than this one) because they are fairly easy to get into and have a good tutorial to get started, and I have a job where I'm expected to explain what I've done to customers rather than just sending them something overcomplicated and expecting them to work for hours to figure it out. So I just don't really see a good argument as to why this game couldn't be a bit more user friendly.

p.s. I am not whingeing about the graphics here, I would still pick up Civ 2 and play it very happily if I had a copy right now I just think this game is too complicated for me to get into and the interface / lack of a proper tutorial doesn't help. | I simply don't get it. You'll be doing fine keeping up constantly against a computer opponent then BAM, they drop 860 troops. I finally had one going fine and had half the board secure and steadily advancing then BAM, I stormed a castle after 6 rounds of siege and my entire board was wiped out. My God was secure and all the way in the back portion of the map so not in anyway vulnerable. Just YOU LOSE! The enemy didn't have even 100 troops near my location I was attacking and I had close to 1000. Makes no sense but won't ever involve any time in this game again.

76561197976281073,262940,Broken Sword 5 - the Serpent's Curse,0.0,Adventure,0,"Ein schönes Spiel wie in der Vergangenheit :) Wer die alten Adventure mag, kann hier nichts falsch mach | Broken Sword es una saga bastante consagrada dentro de la industria, un nombre pesado que significa mucho para las aventuras gráficas y cuya calidad global es indiscutible. Sin embargo, también es innegable que su evolución no ha sido la más afortunada, por lo que esta quinta entrega tenía la gran responsabilidad de devolverle la gloria al nombre de la saga que porta, y su resultado final no pudo haber sido más placentero incluso con sus fallitos.

Una vez más, el intrépido George Stobbart y la astuta Nicole Collard serán los protagonistas de esta nueva aventura, alejándose del experimento que hizo la cuarta entrega en poner a un desaprovechado tercer protagonista que comprometía la integridad del dúo principal. Como viene siendo costumbre en la saga, la trama arrancará con los protagonistas viéndose envueltos en contra de su voluntad en todo un complot a nivel mundial, mezclando ficción y realidad creativamente y esta vez girando en torno al misterio de “La Maldición de la Serpiente”, como bien hace referencia el título.

Uno de los puntos más fuertes de Broken Sword 5, así como del resto de entregas, es que su esencia se mantiene intacta a través de su estilo tan característico a la hora de desarrollar lenta e inexorablemente su trama, sabiendo manejar de forma notable su comedia hilarante con sus momentos más serios, destacando en que la química entre George y Nicole se siente tal y como en la primera entrega, resultando familiares y añejos desde el principio hasta el final. Además de ellos, “The Serpent's Curse” trae de vuelta a viejos conocidos a lo largo de la pentalogía, personajes que bien han podido pasar uno o varios juegos de ausencia total, y sin embargo verlos aquí reunidos manteniendo su personalidad intacta, además de darles un papel a cumplir para con la trama, resulta en un ejemplo de fanservice bien realizado. Y es que haber recuperado su estilo 2D aun conservando efectos en 3D, luciendo unos paisajes hermosos y recreando otros ya conocidos, así como haber recuperado al compositor de los dos primeros juegos hacen sentir a esta quinta entrega más en sintonía con sus orígenes que “The Sleeping Dragon” y “The Angel of Death”.

No obstante, esto acarrea también un problema que tiene no esta entrega en concreto, sino la saga a nivel general, y es una carencia de retroalimentación entre sus tramas. Poniéndonos en contexto, mientras que los Broken Sword 1, 3 y 4 conformaban una especie de trilogía al seguir todos la trama de los templarios, el 2 y el 5 tiran más por contar una narrativa propia, con puntuales referencias a momentos vividos con anterioridad, aunque sintiéndose una cierta desconexión a lo largo de la pentalogía que da la sensación de que cada título se queda en su propia burbuja en vez de formar todos en comunión una narrativa más global y cohesionada.

El motivo por el cual esto llama tanto la atención se comprende mejor al analizar al dúo protagónico; tanto Nicole como George han tenido una evolución nula a lo largo de la saga, quedando cualquier vestigio dentro de cada juego pero reiniciándose sus personalidades con el pasar de las entregas, lo cual acarrea el riesgo de hacerlos parecer planos y estancados en sus pocos rasgos distintivos. Cada título hace referencia a lo que le interesa, ignorando detalles bastante importantes como todo el asunto de George volviéndose un héroe al final del 3, o Nicole al evitar que el mal se esparciera en “The Smoking Mirror”. Y es que ver a estos dos, que ya han pasado por muchas aventuras destapando en más de una ocasión conspiraciones secretas de índole mundial, e incluso enfrentándose a criaturas de fantasía como un dragón malévolo o el espíritu de un demonio, verlos ahora reaccionar con tanta incredulidad ante el misterio de la quinta entrega cuando deberían estar ya sobradamente curtidos en esta clase de situaciones, se siente como un enorme paso atrás en todo sentido.

De todas formas, a pesar de este problema que la saga lleva arrastrando desde su segunda entrega, la trama sigue siendo tan entretenida e intrigante como de costumbre, lo que evita que resulte aburrida. No llega a resultar tan bien escrita y memorable como el primer juego ni alcanza el nivel de epicidad del tercero, pero definitivamente supera al cuarto e incluso ligeramente al segundo, siendo de las historias más interesantes de la franquicia.

Y sacando músculo en lo que esta saga siempre ha sabido hacer bien, los puzzles relucen más que nunca en la quinta entrega, posicionándose como una de las de mayor calidad en ese sentido. Es cierto que la joya de la corona la ostenta el 4 a pesar de su flojísima trama, dejando al 1 como el más equilibrado mientras que el 2 quedaría un poco por debajo y el 3 en el más fácil. El 5 sabe recoger un poco de todo lo bueno de cada entrega, siendo así el más variado en el tema de sus rompecabezas, sin llegar al nivel altísimo del 4 aunque no quedándose lejos, y resultando en una aventura gráfica muy desafiante y gratificante de superar.

A modo de contenido extra, el juego también ofrece un par de detalles interesantes: el famoso sistema de pistas incluido en las versiones remasterizadas de los dos primeros juegos, y una galería de personajes que relata su biografía junto a un modelado de los mismos. Ambos elementos son muy llamativos, pero lastimosamente terminan siendo más un lastre y una decepción respectivamente que algo positivo. El sistema de pistas, totalmente opcional, sigue sufriendo del mismo fallo de diseño en el cual si estamos en una habitación con distintas tareas, dependiendo del orden en que interactuemos con ellas, las pistas para un determinado puzzle pueden solaparse con el de otro, haciendo que este sistema resulte inútil en ocasiones al no poder retroceder si nos hemos adelantado, lo cual es muy común. Además, dicha galería, aunque es un elemento novedoso e interesante, está desaprovechada; diese la sensación de que fue incluida al principio del desarrollo pero se cortó a la mitad, de lo contrario no tendría explicación que personajes terciarios, cuya participación e importancia es mínima, aparezcan en la galería mientras que otros personajes mucho más importantes que se introducen a posteriori en la trama no se les den su correspondiente espacio, acabando con ser una idea a medio desarrollar y dejada sin propósito.

Pareciera ser que Revolution buscó con creces revitalizar el nombre de la saga con esta quinta entrega mucho más reminiscente a las dos primeras sin dejar de aprender del camino recorrido por los dos denostados títulos anteriores, y lo logró con creces. Es un juego bastante sólido tanto en lo técnico como, especialmente, en sus rompecabezas. Si bien su problema de cohesión narrativa con el resto de los juegos persiste y no parece que vaya a cambiar nunca, además de reducir a sus dos protagonistas a meros maniquíes sin desarrollo, su narrativa sigue siendo intrigante y tiene todos los elementos intactos que hacen tan reconocible a Broken Sword. Es una quinta entrega que vuelve a subir el listón de la franquicia por todo lo alto y una aventura tan entretenida como desafiante, de modo que sólo queda esperar a ver cómo harán los chicos de Revolution para mantener a flote su IP más preciada en el futuro. | mamma mia questo gioco!!! sono una divoratrice di avventure grafiche ma sono molto schizzinosa, e mi piace solo roba di alta qualità... questo come moltissimi altri giochi vecchi che sono poi tornati in voga è più di un gioco.. è come stare in famiglia... non smetterei mai di giocare a giochi così belli, la grafica è eccezionale, la caratterizzazione dei personaggi fantastica e divertente, l'ho adorato dall'inizio alla fine.... vi prego fatene ancora! | I haven't given up this game yet but I think I am close to it.

[h2] ДУХОВНИЙ СІКВЕЛ PLANESCAPE TORMENT? [/h2]

Ця гра, на жаль, не може повноцінно вважатися духовним спадкоємцем [b] Planescape: Torment [/b]. Причин для цього достатньо. Насамперед, сеттинг Numenera виглядає дещо душним і позбавленим тієї магічної аури, яка змушувала мене годинами сидіти на Wiki по Planescape і вивчати деталі світу.

До цього додається помітний копіпаст ідей без спроби внести щось унікальне, а також гігантське перенасичення світу надто химерними предметами та явищами. Вони більше відволікають, ніж сприяють глибшому зануренню у головний сюжет чи дослідження світу. Шифри (одноразові артефакти), шини (аналог кришок із Fallout), кризи (будь-який конфлікт, де застосовується сила) – здається, розробники вирішили вигадати свої терміни для всього, що вже існує в реальному світі. Але це більше заплутує, ніж полегшує занурення.

[h2] БОЙОВА СИСТЕМА: [/h2]

Краще б її не було, без неї гра б нічого не втратила. Бойова система нудна і затягнута настільки, що під час кожного файту я відкривав Twitch/Youtube і дивився щось справді цікаве. Найсмішніше: у розкладці написано, що для пропуску ходу потрібно натискати пробіл, але насправді дуже часто натомість потрібно тицяти на маленьку кнопку на екрані.  Як альтернатива, можна просто бігати навколо ворога, як угарілий, поки не скінчаться очки руху. Затикування ворогів триває так довго, що під нього можна спокійно заснути.

[h2] СЮЖЕТ: [/h2]

Сюжет також намагається копіювати Planescape, але програє йому на всіх рівнях. Головний герой позбавлений загадкового бекграунду, який робив [i]Nameless One [/i] таким цікавим. Компаньйони? Деякі нудні, деякі непогані, але всі вони програють [i] команді по порятунку світу [/i] , яка супроводжувала Безіменного у Planescape.

Для дослідження є близько трьох великих локацій, але лише одна з них створює ту саму ауру загадковості, у яку віриш. Решта локацій радше викликає питання: [i] Які речовини вживали розробники? [/i] Сеттинг [i] Numenera [/i] дозволяє вписати фактично будь-що, адже пробілів у ЛОРі всесвіту незліченна кількість, але, на жаль, цим не скористалися у повній мірі.

[h2] ГРАФІКА: [/h2]

Всі локації дуже красиві, але мене всю гру не покидало відчуття що цей світ дещо бездушний.

[h2] RPG ЕЛЕМЕНТИ: [/h2]

Додаткові квести є, їх якість коливається від просто нормальної до чудової. Є можливість відігравати злого, доброго, емпатичного, егоїстичного або альтруїстичного персонажа, на що реагуватимуть компаньйони. Але взаємодія з ними далека від ідеалу: будь-які зміни у їхньому сприйнятті головного героя трапляються дуже рідко. 

З хорошого, майже у кожного члена команди є кілька варіантів того, як він закінчить історію, а ці вибори залежать від геть неочікуваних дії та виборів протягом сюжету. [spoiler] Малолітню дебілку можна відправити до чужої сім'ї, до її власної, або ж лишитись із нею надалі. [/spoiler]

Не вистачає реіграбельності у взаємодії зі світом. У Planescape була величезна кількість прихованого контенту, який треба було або знайти випадково, або ж відкрити гайд. Тут нічого подібного немає: що-небудь пропустити практично неможливо, адже гра демонструє більшість свого контенту при першому проходженні.

Further updates to my saga coming. Good day all! | This is a dense, inspiring, and beautiful world that is worth experiencing for everyone, but it can be overwhelming, slow, and exhausting to get through depending on your stamina for complex/lengthy dialogue exchanges.

If you’re looking for a combat heavy rpg with vast in-depth builds to try and extensive combat encounters to participate in, then this is not that game. Combat is just ok and should probably be avoided through speech more often than not. Exploration is like every other CRPG in that you click around to uncover the map and talk/interact with everything you see.

Stories and worldbuilding are the main draw much like it’s predecessor. This area is equally it’s greatest strength and greatest hurdle. Dialogue is a dense, intriguing, complex tapestry of options, routes, and consequences that make you want to reload constantly to see “what if”? However, there is a ton of reading to get through and the UI can be slow to respond if you are trying to skip lines. If you are coming from a more mainstream game like BG3 then this will most likely wear you down but also may make such a game seem juvenile by comparison. This is for those hardcore CRPG nerds that have built up that slow burn stamina and value dialogue/world complexity over refined gameplay.

Visually I think it’s beautiful but with not the highest quality assets. Soundtrack is great as well.

Performance wise no issues since it is very easy to run. Some minor pathfinding bugs and sometimes the dialogue tree will come to a screeching halt, making you unable to progress a conversation (extremely annoying with how long some conversations are).

This is one of those games where you wish it had the funding and extensive development time that others have benefited from. You see all the potential in the world but its interrupted by the fine frays of half steps, limited time, and smaller budget. Even though it could be so much more it is still a game that is so much as is.

Normalde parti tabanlı rpglerden pek haz etmezdim ama bu çok zevkliydi. 

Oynanış sıra tabanlı, klasik olarak bir saldırı yapacağınızda size bir % oranı veriyor ve bu orana göre vurup vurmama ihtimaliniz belirleniyor. Tabii ki karakterlerin yeteneklerine ve kullandıkları silahlara göre bu oran değişiklik gösteriyor bu yüzden bunlara göre ayarlayıp oynamalısınız. Bunun haricinde bomba, füze gibi şeyler kullanabiliyorsunuz. Ama tabii ki bunların vurma oranı yok bu yüzden kullandığınızda kesinlikle hasar veriyorlar. Karakterlerin her birinin yeteneklerine göre değişiklik gösteren enerjileri var. Bu yüzden her sıra size döndüğünde tek vuruş yapmaya yetecek kadar enerjiniz olacak. Onun için sizin dövüşü kazanmanıza en çok yardımcı olacak rakibe saldırmanız gerekli. Ayrıca tavsiyem ağır silahlar kullanmayın, çünkü vurma ihtimalleri diğer silahlara göre daha düşük ve daha fazla mermi harcıyorlar. Çorak topraklarda bulabildiğiniz her mermi değerli olacak ve en iyi şekilde değerlendirmeniz gerekecek. Kendi adıma en çok sinirlendiğim kısım vurma oranı %80 gibi yüksek oranları gösterse de çoğu zaman saldırıları ıskalamak oldu. Büyük ihtimalle siz de oynadığınızda aynısını yaşayacaksınız hazırlıklı olmanızı öneririm. 

Karakter yükseltmelerine gelelim. Oyunda bir sürü farklı sınıf bulunuyor, istediğiniz karakteri istediğiniz sınıflara göre yükseltebiliyorsunuz. Hepsini sayamıyorum çünkü gerçekten fazla şey var. Kilit Açma, Mekanik Ustası ve Sezgi gibi beceriler işinize yarayacaktır, bunun haricinde takımınız 7 kişi olacak. Her birini farklı bir silah konusunda ustalaştırmanızı öneririm. Bu sayede aynı mermiyi kullanmak zorunda kalmayacaksınız ve daha efektif dövüşler yapabileceksiniz. Ama karakterlerinize Hayvan Dili gibi hiçbir işe yaramayacak yetenekler vermemeye çalışın çünkü işe yaramayacaklar. 

Her RPG oyununda olduğu gibi bu oyunda da seçimler ile oyunun sonunu veya olayların gidişatını değiştiriyorsunuz. Bu yüzden ona göre hareket edebilirsiniz. Ve bazı görevlerde ne yaparsanız yapın iyi sona ulaşmak mümkün olmayabilir, işin güzelliği de burda. Hikayeye gelirsek oyunda Çöl Muhafızları denilen bir askeri birliğin üyesiyiz ve onlar için çalışıyoruz. Verdikleri görevleri yerine getiriyoruz ve ya getirmiyoruz, size kalmış. Oyunun birden fazla sonu var ve emin olun hepsi sizi tatmin edecektir. 

Son olarak oyunun incelemelerine baktığımda olumsuz yazıların hepsinin Türkçe dil ile ilgili olduğunu gördüm. Aslında komik çünkü Steam'de Türkçe dil desteği var yazmasına rağmen oyun içinde olmadığını söylemişler. Bu kısmen yanlış çünkü oyunu satın aldığınızda size 2 tane oyun veriyor biri ''Wasteland 2'' diğeri ise ''Wasteland 2: Director's Cut'' evet Wasteland 2 olan versiyonda Türkçe yok ama diğer Director's Cut sürümünü indirirseniz Türkçe dil onun içinde. İki oyun arasındaki fark ne diye sorarsanız herhangi bir fark olduğunu düşünmüyorum, ikisi de hemen hemen aynı oyun. O yüzden olumsuz vermeden önce insanlar biraz araştırmalı ve yargısız infaz yapmamalı. 

Her neyse oyun kesinlikle pişman etmeyecek türden bir RPG. İndirimde 3,74 dolara kadar düşüyor. Bu fiyata bu oyun bedava sayılır. 40 saatlik bir oyun süresini garanti edebilirim. Ayrıca incelemede 4 saat gözüktüğüne bakmayın, o saat Wasteland 2 oyunundaki saatimi gösteriyor yani içinde Türkçe dil olmayan sürümü. Director's Cut sürümünde 80 saatim var. | I have played this for 28 hours and decided not to continue. It's just too sloggish. I have completed Wasteland 3, and was told Wasteland 2 has better stories and decision. That may be true, but the quality of life os Wasteland 2 is too poor in comparison to Wasteland 3.

As the spiritual successor to the original Wasteland (and granddaddy of Fallout), it delivers deep turn-based combat, tough moral choices, and a world that reacts to your every decision—sometimes in hilariously brutal ways.

The game’s writing is sharp, filled with dark humor, strange factions, and quests that rarely have a clear “right” answer. Squad customization is top-notch, letting you build a team of Desert Rangers suited for diplomacy, hacking, or just good old-fashioned shootouts. Every bullet counts, every decision matters, and the wasteland never plays fair.

Sure, it’s tough, a little clunky at times, and doesn’t hold your hand—but for fans of classic CRPGs, Wasteland 2 is a must-play. Just remember: save often, and never underestimate a guy with a sawed-off shotgun. | Liked the gameplay and the combat very much

[quote][i]Всем привет. Автор не несет ответственности за причиненный вред своими обзорами. Любое сходство с другими обзорами случайно. Данный обзор является лишь мнением автора и вы можете всегда оставаться при своем мнении! Спасибо за понимание и приятной игры![/i][/quote]

[h1]Описание:[/h1]
[i][b]Stellaris[/b] — это смесь грандиозной 4X-стратегии, ролевой игры и интерактивного романа, где вы сами пишете историю своего народа среди звёзд. Разработчики создали  эпическое повествование о взлётах и падениях цивилизации. От первых робких шагов в космосе до управления межгалактической империей — здесь есть место всему: дипломатии, войнам, предательствам и открытиям, которые перевернут ваше представление о жанре.[/i]

[b]Основа игры: Механики, которые затягивают на сотни часов[/b]
[i][list]
[*] [b]Создание своей цивилизации:[/b] Stellaris начинается с того, что вы буквально конструируете расу из десятков параметров: этика (милитаристы, пацифисты, ксенофобы), тип общества (биологическое, роботы, псионики), черты (адаптивность, интеллект, агрессия) и даже внешность. Хотите играть за миролюбивых космических слизней, строящих галактическую федерацию? Или за машинную империю, стремящуюся ассимилировать все органические расы? Здесь возможно всё.

[*] [b]Исследование и открытия:[/b] Галактика в Stellaris генерируется случайно, и каждое новое игра — это путешествие в неизвестность. Вы будете:
- Исследовать аномалии (например, древние руины или гравитационные аномалии).
- Встречать кризисы (вторжение внегалактических захватчиков, восстание синтетиков).
- Заключать союзы или уничтожать соседей.

[*] [b]Дипломатия и войны:[/b] 
- Дипломатия: От торговых соглашений до создания федераций — здесь можно решать судьбы галактики без единого выстрела.
- Войны: Система военных целей позволяет вести не тотальные войны, а конфликты с чёткими задачами (захват системы, освобождение вассала).
- Шпионаж и провокации: Саботаж, кража технологий, поддержка повстанцев — идеально для любителей «тихих» конфликтов.

[*] [b]Экономика и управление:[/b] 
- Балансировка ресурсов (энергия, минералы, пища, потребительские товары) — основа процветания.
- Планирование заселения планет, строительство мегасооружений (кольцевые миры, сферы Дайсона) и управление населением с уникальными потребностями.
[/list][/i]

[i][b]Сильные стороны: Почему Stellaris покоряет сердца[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]Нарративная глубина:[/b] События в игре — это не просто текст, а истории с последствиями. Например, обнаружение «Храмового комплекса» может привести к пробуждению древнего бога-червя, который переформатирует вашу расу, или к гибели всего живого в секторе.

[*] [b]Реиграбельность:[/b] Благодаря случайной генерации галактики, сотням событий и возможности создавать уникальные цивилизации, каждая партия кардинально отличается от предыдущей.

[*] [b]Моддерская поддержка:[/b] Stellaris обладает одной из самых активных моддерских сообществ. Моды добавляют новые расы, сюжеты, механики и даже полностью меняют сеттинг.

[*] [b]Постоянное развитие:[/b] Paradox регулярно обновляет игру, исправляя ошибки и добавляя новые фичи. Даже спустя 7 лет после релиза Stellaris остаётся актуальной.
[/list][/i]

[h1]Плюсы:[/h1]
[i][list]
[*] [b]Беспрецедентная свобода творчества:[/b] Создавайте уникальные расы с собственной этикой, чертами и историей. Хотите играть за пацифистов-грибов или машин-уничтожителей? Всё возможно. Проработанная система происхождений (например, «Потерянная колония» или «Синтетическая эволюция») задаёт тон всей партии.

[*] [b]Нарративная глубина:[/b] Сотни случайных событий, археологических цепочек и кризисов превращают игру в космическую сагу. Истории в духе научной фантастики: от восстания ИИ до встречи с божественными червями.

[*] [b]Реиграбельность:[/b] Случайная генерация галактики, разные типы кризисов (вторжение Пожирателей, Восстание машин) и бесконечные комбинации рас обеспечивают уникальность каждой партии.

[*] [b]Дипломатия и взаимодействие:[/b] От создания федераций до подрывных операций — здесь есть инструменты для любой стратегии. Возможность играть без войн, побеждая через культурное доминирование или политические интриги.

[*] [b]Моддерская поддержка:[/b] Огромная библиотека модов: от новых рас и кораблей до полных переработок вселенной (например, «Star Trek» или «Warhammer 40K»).

[*] [b]Атмосферность:[/b] Эпичный саундтрек, стилистика кораблей и планет, голосовые оповещения — всё это погружает в атмосферу живой галактики.

[*] [b]Постоянное развитие:[/b] Paradox регулярно обновляет игру, добавляя новые механики и исправляя ошибки.

[*] [b]Достижения:[/b] Присутствие получения различных достижений, что добавляет элемент соревновательности и мотивации с другими игроками которые смогли получить сложные достижения с особыми условиями.

[*] [b]Коллекционные предметы:[/b] Присутствуют обои, смайлики, карточки из которых можно скрафтить значки
[/list][/i]

[h1]Минусы:[/h1]
[i][list]
[*] [b]Высокий порог вхождения:[/b] Десятки ресурсов, технологий и механик могут перегрузить новичков. Обучение в игре поверхностное.

[*] [b]Проблемы с оптимизацией:[/b] На поздних стадиях игра начинает лагать, особенно в больших галактиках. Мультиплеер часто страдает от десинхронизации.

[*] [b]Дисбаланс механик:[/b] Некоторые стратегии (например, спам роботами или «танкирование» инфляции) остаются неоправданно сильными. ИИ часто действует нелогично: мирные империи внезапно объявляют войны, а ксенофобы предлагают союзы.

[*] [b]Повторяемость:[/b] После 100+ часов цепочки событий и диалоги начинают повторяться. Кризисы следуют одним и тем же сценариям.

[*] [b]Зависимость от DLC:[/b] Без дополнений (например, Utopia или Apocalypse) игра ощущается неполной. Многие «крутые» фичи (кольцевые миры, титаны) locked за платными DLC.

[*] [b]Ограниченная роль личности:[/b] Лидеры и фракции слабо влияют на игру. Их смерть или смена редко меняют курс империи.
[/list][/i]

[h1]Заключение:[/h1]
[i]Stellaris — это не просто игра. Это симулятор бесконечности, где каждая звезда может стать домом для новой цивилизации, а каждый чёрный ящик — хранить секреты, способные изменить галактику. Да, здесь есть проблемы с балансом и оптимизацией, но когда ваш флот из тысяч кораблей вступает в бой с внегалактическими захватчиками под эпичную музыку, вы понимаете: это не просто код и спрайты. Это — настоящее космическое приключение.[/i]

If you're meticulous and enjoy micromanaging, this is a great game to play. The mods for this game are also amazing! I highly recommend checking out the steam workshop for this game if you ever feel like vanilla starts to get kinda stale. And while this is my most played game, I DO NOT RECOMMEND GETTING THIS GAME FULL PRICE. Frequently this game goes on sale for like 75% and the base game alone is not worth the price tag especially as a lot of features that most Stellaris players like messing with are behind DLCs so unless there's some part of the game that you're desperate to play with I'd get the base game and any interesting DLC while they're on sale. | 肥肠好的游戏，使我的巨像旋转，之前玩的盗版，现在终于史低补票（仅本体）了，但P社的DLC是真贵，只能用学习版，等有钱了慢慢补票吧。 | So this is exactly the type of multiple month game time negative review that gets screen shot and memed on social media, but I'm sad to say I mean it in the most literal sense.  I have enjoyed much of my play time with Stellaris, but I emphatically don't recommend anyone purchase this game in it's current, maximum DLC form.
When this game launched, it was a refreshingly basic 4X. Most of the changes made in the early years all the way to the Nemesis expansion added meaningfully to the gameplay without making it overwhelming and complicated for new players.  Unfortunately recent patches and expansions have unfortunately been hats on hats, mostly adding complexity without adding fun.  I have enjoyed the ride for the most part, but like most Paradox games the continual addition of DLC eventually replaces the game you loved with something you barely recognize while draining your wallet."

然而，问题不仅仅这么简单，这么优秀的游戏却有着一群跟我们思维构造不同的GM和MOD，他们在没有事先通知的情况下封了几乎所有参加过PVP的人，而且时间有的多达30天甚至是365天，经常玩这个游戏热爱这个游戏每天游戏时间足够长的所有国人无一幸免，而且申诉机制异常奇怪，真正该封禁的人被解封了，无辜群众反而被关在了里面，据一些因为玩游戏频率不高而侥幸逃过一劫的国人反应，本来偏小众的游戏的在线人数进一步减少，本来一场联赛平时1分钟以内就一定能排到对手现在却排了四五分钟都无法匹配成功，游玩人数大量减少，玩家纷纷弃坑，然而面对这种结果，GM和MOD却仍然表示满意，绝对自己做得很是正确。另外，由于这个游戏是人治，所以管理上有明显的偏袒，和mod关系好的人不会被封禁然而其余人很容易被封禁，据少数国人反应，游戏内可能有一定反华倾向，在世界打字中文会收获到举报，总之你一定要做好随时被封禁的心理准备即使你只是正常的老老实实的玩游戏。一次封禁很有可能直接抹消掉你之前的时间和金钱投入，所以，即使这个游戏很有趣，但大家入坑前还是要慎重，即使决定了入坑，购买付费内容的时候还是要慎重，毕竟，他们封禁你的时候不会在乎你花了几百几千人民币的。 | Pros:  I was transported back in time 30 years, the flavor and feel of PnP RPG gaming is perfect.

Also: this game is a _very cheap_ strat game, with minimalist card building elements.

There's really nothing special about the two main parts of the game being combat and the story.

Only time where I really enjoyed playing is one section with multiple extended combat encounters where I had to plan out a strategy and ration my consumable items. Not sure if it was scripted or a random chance on doing a mission but I ended up getting a surprise combat after I believed everything was finished.

The hacking ""decking"" mechanic is a complete waste of time and consists of even worse combat just to use cameras for vision where it doesn't matter or turrets in areas where no enemies go. It also uses turns in combat so you're missing a fourth party member just to do it.
The Shaman class is one that I want to like but can't because of your summons have a chance to escape and turn on you every turn with increasing chances. I love the idea of support classes in general, but even its haste buff feels underwhelming. The range on the starting Shaman NPC's damage reduction aoe is also so short that there's no point in using it. 

The story isn't great either. A good majority of your supporting characters either do not like you or do not trust you which leads you to pry scraps and pieces of information from them over time. You're also mostly doing a bunch of disjointed side missions ranging from mildly interesting to a waste of time that makes you dislike your party members even more because they disapproved of you doing the morally right thing or doing anything risky. All of this is sometimes broken up by story exposition that goes on for too long and does not result in anything except your team's information broker saying that he'll look into it. | A good CRPG for its modest budget. Liked the companions and the main story while taking some predictable turns remained enjoyable for the most part, seems like there is a decent variety of outcomes, will probably replay it with couple more builds to see how things play out with different choices and I want to see what passing some skillchecks does, unlike modern CRPGs you can't use party members to pass them, gotta do most of them yourself. There is definitely an intent for you to play some specific builds like INT with high biotech skill. Can't say for sure that all build options are equally interesting and rewarding but a rather simpleminded ""All points in Quickness"" basic gunslinger with just enough Charisma to get two etiquettes: corporate and shadowrunner, still was satisfying on the first playthrough. Just don't take Socialite, seen like one etiquette check involving it through the whole game and it was just for a bit extra money, stick to something like Security or Academic instead.

On an additional note, I couldn't help finding the epilogue of the main story a bit underwhelming. You make the final choice, go back to your home, talk about it with your crew and then get a bit of extra context on what transpired and what's gonna happen from couple very important (in a setting, not narrative, that is) NPCs before getting a text epilogue that tells about the several events in the future, some of them probably an outcome of your decisions throughout the game. And that's it. I guess the underwhelming part is a natural outcome of the narrative framing, you get dragged into this deadly grand mystery and resolving it is the only way to survive but you don't really have any other motivation, at best to avenge an NPC who dies in the prologue and another NPC who dies in the middle of the game. So while your involvement is narratively justified, the personal stakes you and your companions have don't feel interesting?  No matter how well you furnish it with dialogues ""Phew, that was quite something. Glad we survived. What do we do now?"" is still something lacking oomph, at least for me. | DragonFall Nails it.

From the tone of the world, to the depth and nuance of the characters you encounter the writing in this game walks the line of ""in world"" conversations while not verging into the valley of cringe that is easy to slip into. 

This entry has just enough beats to satisfy, challenging fun combat and options to make it your own.  

this is an instant key entry to the genre. I will be stealing characters and setting elements for my live game | Loved this. I slept on the SR series for years, picked this up mostly for research, and found a lot of unexpectedly interesting design and narrative decisions. It's hard to pick one thing that SR:DF does unusually well, but the ambience, systems, narrative, writing, art never fall below 'very good' and they work together harmoniously. And of course it's really faithful to the original IP if you were there for that in the early TRPG days, so if you're here for nostalgia, fill yer boots.

Really sad when it finished - glad I have SRHK to go on to. | Good story and game play. I wish there was more combat and opportunities for conflicts."

[h2]📝 Sum-Up[/h2]
[i]Star Trek Online offers an authentic Trek experience wrapped in an aging MMO framework. While the core space combat and story content shine, aggressive monetization and technical issues hold it back. Best approached as a casual single-player Trek game with optional multiplayer elements, rather than a full-fledged MMO investment.[/i]

[h2]📖 In-Depth Analysis[/h2]

[h3]🌍 Core Gameplay[/h3]
The game splits between space and ground combat, with space being the clear highlight. Ship-to-ship battles capture the tactical feel of Trek combat, allowing for meaningful build customization and strategy. Ground combat, unfortunately, feels like an afterthought with dated mechanics and poor AI. The story missions effectively blend both elements but clearly favor space encounters.

[h3]👥 Monetization & Progression[/h3]
Here's where things get complicated. While technically playable for free, the game aggressively pushes premium purchases. Top-tier ships often cost $30+ each, with some rare variants reaching hundreds of dollars on the player market. Free players can eventually earn premium currency through grinding, but the time investment is substantial. Inventory space, character slots, and quality-of-life features are also paywalled.

[h3]⚔️ Content & Longevity[/h3]
The story content is extensive and well-written, featuring authentic Trek storylines and voice acting from series actors. Regular updates add new episodes and seasonal events. However, endgame content largely revolves around repeating Task Force Operations and grinding reputation systems. The PvP scene is minimal, with most players focusing on PvE content.

[h3]🔩 Technical Performance[/h3]
Running on an aging engine, STO shows its technical limitations. Server performance is inconsistent, with frequent lag and rubber-banding issues. The UI feels dated and can be overwhelming for new players. While the game runs on modest hardware, it doesn't perform as smoothly as its age would suggest.

[h3]🎵 Atmosphere & Authenticity[/h3]
When it comes to capturing the Star Trek universe, STO excels. From accurate ship models to familiar locations and sound effects, the game nails the franchise's atmosphere. The writing respects Trek lore while adding its own contributions to the universe. Character customization is extensive, allowing players to create their perfect Starfleet officer.

[h2]⭐ Final Verdict[/h2]
Star Trek Online is best viewed as a free Star Trek game with MMO elements rather than a traditional MMO. For Trek fans, the authentic universe representation and story content make it worth trying. However, players should approach with caution regarding monetization - the game constantly tempts you to spend, with some premium ships costing more than several AAA games combined.

The ideal way to play is treating it as a casual single-player game, enjoying the story content and occasional events without getting caught up in the endgame grind or ship collection aspects. The free content provides hundreds of hours of entertainment, but trying to ""catch up"" or compete at endgame will either require significant financial investment or grinding that would make the Ferengi proud.

Recommended for: Star Trek fans willing to overlook technical issues and aggressive monetization
Not Recommended for: Players seeking a modern MMO experience or those sensitive to microtransaction pressure | I have played this on and off for over a decade. I enjoy getting some Star Trek content, looking at the cool ships and managing my crew. | When this game was released it was good. Now it's too woke to enjoy. | great game to kill time | bien"
76561197976281073,313730,Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius,0.0,"Free To Play, Indie, RPG, Strategy",0,"for a free game this is great - the battles get a bit hard if your not on the idealised upgrade path however its the story that's the best part of the game anyway so I just dialed down the battle difficulty a bit when it got to being a real chore and enjoyed the game even more.  I initially thought the girls all looked a bit similar but its quickly clear that each has a deliberately very different personaility from each other.  You get to be their hero - and why not.  I'll not say too much but the ending was good and leaves you wanting to buy the next game in the storyline - having saidf that, this one is plenty long enoufgh for a good enjoyable playthrough spo its not a cheap teaser so you buy the next, its a great game in its own right. | For a free game this is surprisinly high quality. The combat is challenging (if you want) and fun. The soundtrack also is beautiful and very fitting in many scenes, though there are a few were it doesnt mach the tone of the scene but only a few. Characters are interesting and quite likeable. Ships and ryders designs are very well done. Overall a must play for lovers of strategy games and space operas. | I downloaded this when it first came out, played for 17 minutes and then stopped for years. Then I was bored and decided to play it again. I had a great time. What an intense ending.

The art is poor, though to be fair this is a free indie game. There's not many event CGs and most of the times you just have a background and characters in their standard standing position behind the dialogue screen, whose speaker is hard to follow because the name and the dialogue are separated so far apart. If they changed the dialogue box color for each character, like brown for Ava and red for Asaga, it would have been much better.

The gameplay is... laggy? The attack animation is very basic and takes quite long, and I skipped them a lot, but there's no transition or anything. When you click to skip an animation, the screen pauses for a second and then you're already on the next phase. There's no sliding to close the scene or screen fading out to black and opens up to the next scene. This is particularly annoying during the enemy's turn as you may want to skip a lot of enemy's animation.

The voice actors are alright. The dialogues aren't voiced and they only speak a few lines during battle. I especially like Ava's voice actor, but Icari's out-of-nowhere tsundere lines are simply horrible.

So why did I give a thumbs up? It's the well-written story. The conflict the main character is having actually feels rough, heavy and difficult. It's not a story about choosing which girl to date or anything cheap like that. It's about what kind of leader you want to be. You have a ship to protect. Your morals and professionalism are crossing each other, and the romance just makes it even harder. I only care for one of the girls, but maybe that's just me being me rather than the other romance being poorly written. The story builds up to an AMAZING ending, I'm telling you.

I won't spoil anything, but GOD DAMN I'm glad I chose the right option (for me) on that final choice. IT'S SO GOOD! | Oh well, I downloaded this one for the waifus, but, surprisingly enough, I found the gameplay part to be quite immersive and challenging, if a bit unpolished. The plot is your standard space opera...with battle spacefaring waifus (too bad there's no real way to pursue a romantic relationship with one of them - the plot is more or less linear in this department). As for the production values, they aren't anything special, but more than adequate for a free game. Overall, a solid experience which got me interested in the pay-to-play sequel. | So for anime fans its fair, but for people that actually want good gameplay its pathetic. There are limited choices to make in the storyline and the battles, which are the majority of the game, are pathetically designed.

The difficulty settings say the default is the way the game is designed to be played, great but i like harder challenges. So I played on hard... well the SECOND mission it is not possible to surivive until TURN 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! with simple luck, and getting that luck seems to be about a 50/50 chance.

because it is only the second mission means there are no particular stategies you can do to survive longer, it comes down to nothing other than iff the enemy hits you or misses on their turns. So what is the point of this? it's utterly pathetically broken as strategic combat."

76561197976281073,316010,Magic Duels,0.0,"Free To Play, Strategy",0,"A little background, I am both a big fan of the 'free to play' model as well as the Magic The Gathering card game.
I've been playing Magic for about four years now.
I've owned a few of the other digital game versions as well as having a few competitive decks in real life as well.

It's been no secret that many people have found the digital series to be pretty hit or miss. I don't know what Wizard's of The Coast does to miss the boat so hard. But I'll first put this review into a technical and then a business sense:

What works about the game:
-Bare bones, the game launches, plays, has a GUI and from what I've seen as of February, very little bugs. It's a smooth experience to start and once you get into the interface it's an enjoyable segue into the game.
-The music as always is top notch. I have yet to see anyone lodge a complaint against the music
-Fair art direction. The cards already have art that they have on file so it's hard to say that they really go out of their way with the art on the cards. However, the 3D cutscenes don't quite match the style of the cards and come off more as a Nickelodeon spinoff of Magic; which, depending on your preference, may be a good thing.
-The deck builder that everyone's been asking for is here. People complain about it not featuring a 'search by name' function. But I truly don't care. If you can remember the picture it takes all of about two seconds. And even if you unlock all the cards, it doesn't hurt to give your other options a browse while you flip to the card you want.

What doesn't work-
Now, before I get into the blemishes, it should be said that I generally enjoy the game but a review in my book is to tell people whether or not the product is worth investing in.
-The RNG. The point of the RNG being so poor is obviously an incentive to get you to buy more and more boosters. Hopefully with your own money. An easy way to observe this is to play the story mode decks. The 'challenge' often doesn't come from having a winnable deck and being forced to outthink your opponent's cards. It's redrawing, and restarting the duel over and over and over until you get a really good hand, (Hopefully with good draws afterward) and sometimes even then, some duels I found were almost impossible to win unless the opponent suffered from several bad draws.
-The Free To Pay model. Now, as I said, I love Free to Play. That's an awesome step forward with games with a competitive environment. I'll talk more about that in a second. But the problem here is that in the competitive side of the game, there's a huge incentive put on buying better cards than everyone else. Keep buy buy buying and hope your RNG gets you better cards than the other guy. A little RNG isn't bad, it keeps things interesting. However, when the incentive is to force the player to spend money when they would rather play with skill, then it's a waste of development time as you'll be seeing diminishing returns on your usage of those features.

What's just in the middle?
Well, between good and bad there's a few things that just sort of fall by the wayside.
-The free cards you earn are not very competitive.
Grinding for better cards can be fun. However, it shouldn't be done in the multiplayer against people with better cards, or at the very least not left to RNG boosters. Not neccessarily saying that the cards offered from the story should be perfectly competitive, but at least enough (if you've completed the whole story) to be able to play against starting level duelists.
-Lack of dynamic matchmaking
As far as I can tell, there's not really any matchmaking algorithms in place to match you with people at your skill level. You seem to be matched with just whoever happens to be playing. This results often in playing against other players with much better or much worse cards than you rather than someone who offers a challenge and a fun game.
-Lack of players
I don't know how many people actually play this game. But I'm judging that not a lot do from how long it can take to matchmake. I guess many people would just rather play the hard-format card game.

Ways to fix it really simply-
1.) First fix and probably most important: specifically two modes that I think will make the game even worth installing-
-Team battle: Basically, five players on each team (5v5) or (4v4) or (3v3) duel it out with premade competitive decks (similar to picking a hero in Dota, each deck has unique themes and abilities and once picked, can't be picked by the enemy team).
This is going to be the main draw of the game. Teams can use game chat to speak to eachother, and make tactical decisions. Suddenly there's a team dynamic, and it's even better than just playing 1v1 with a friend.
-Free battles: These are the current gametypes but reworked. #2 will talk about how to improve this mode. These are duels using decks that you've assembled yourself using the cards that are in the game. However, there can be certain rules applied:
Legacy, Modern, etc.

2.)Observe functioning Free to play systems: perhaps some of the best and most marketably viable free to play models are actually on Steam. Team Fortress and Dota 2 come with their own brand of users and you take them or leave them. Magic is much the same. However to make Magic work as an online game, all the content of the game needs to be free and readily available with balancing patches to control the meta game.
The reason why this works: players can spend more time on the game getting better, and more competitive with the game. Switching the content you want to buy to cosmetic, makes the game more worth playing.

3.) By switching the focus to cosmetic, people invest more time into the game. As they invest, they spend more. I hate to say it, but Dota found the magic formula. You spend X amount of hours and as X+fun=Financial investment.
Now you may say, but that still applies to this game! However, consider that because it's also pay to win RNG, you've got to face facts and admit that you've also got, X+fun-(loss x loss conditions)=fincancial investment. The greater the amount of losses, the less likely that user is to spend money on anything in the game. Nobody except a very small handful of people with huge egos will buy boosters just to compete in a pay to win game. It's very niche. The rest of the people willing to buy are hardcore magic fans who are already likely to just buy hard copies of cards.

Ultimately Wizards is in no financial trouble. However, they are walking away from a lot of money with this particular online game. By tweaking their approach by a bit, their financial rewards could be greater.

Players however, if you are a huge Magic fan then you'll love that the game is free to play, but may grow tired of the monotonous grinding for boosters and long loss streaks in attempts to get better cards with less frustrating outcomes.
If you're not a fan of Magic, but a fan of card games looking to install one on steam, then try it out.
If you're not a fan of Magic and can take or leave a card game, then pass. There are plenty of other, (better) free to play games out there.

If the game is updated to a state where it adresses some of its core issues, then I will happily update this review. | bonjour a toute l'équipe , je me prénomme nadège je suis maman et je suis atteinte d'une maladie qui m'oblige a rester alliter et j'avoue que magic me fait passer des heures agréable et m'occupe bien ...donc pour cela je vous remercie tous ... cepentdant les petits hics de magic sont : les decs de départ devrais etre dissociés d'avec les dec d'aide constructeur pour les confirmée et j'avous que se systeme d'aide mais souvent précieux mais je retrouve souvent mes anciens jeux ....le deuxieme hic que je rencontre c'est avec les mauvais joueurs en effet quand ils n'ont pas de jeux ils font tourner le chrono jusqu'à la fin je pense que pour ce genre de technic vous devriez mettre en place un chrono dégréssif comme ca plus ils attendent sur le chrono ben le second tour leurs chrono et plus rapid ou plus cour bref voilà mes opinions je vous remercie une nouvelle fois et faite que votre jeu dure toujours car je l'adore amitié a tous .........      nadège | I recently started getting back into magic after being inactive for around 15 years. However, other than standard tournaments, I don't have many opportunities to play against other players, so I figured I needed an online version of magic to practice. Magic duels is OK to get back into the mechanics and see what other people play, but other than that, it's a HUGE disappointment:

- Insane grind. buying boosters as a poor kid in the 90ies (p2w in its pure form) was more fun.

- Stupid deck restrictions: rares 2x, uncommons 3x (to keep serious players away or p2w low?)

- Strange format: not pure standard, balance seems off ( banned smuggler's copter still being played, too many cheap removal spells...)

- Terrible connectivity: connection losses all the time, dropped players get replaced by AI and most of the time, you have to beat the AI in order to not receive a loss, alt+tab is all it takes to get disconnected, possibly lots of room for exploits. Lags are so hard that often you can't hit the stop button to react to your opponent, which defeats the whole purpose of playing magic. 

- No possibility to interact with other players: no chat, no trade, nothing. Which might be wise, because...

- The duels community equals the bottom of the magic community. You won't find many good matches, real magic fans are probablly somewhere else to be found. Often enough, playing a removal spell is all that it takes for your opponent to pull the plug and let the AI take over.... which surprisingly often leads to the AI coming back hard and winning a lost match... and then there are these assholes just waiting everytime as long as the timer allows (playing a land after waiting for 1 minute) to make YOU unpatient and disconnect, giving them a default win.

- Always playing against the same decks. Right now: red burn, topters, green ramp, sphinx tutelage. boring.

- The campaigns are a joke. The way they try to tell stories is just unworthy of the magic universe. It's nothing but still images and written dialouge, combined with a muted 90ies-style render-cutscene at the end of each campaign. And the stories are just boring. It rather ruins the unvierse for me...

- Presentation is rudimentary at best. Graphics are just the cards, a boring table, generic FX like fireballs and lightnings... even tablets could do better. There is only 1 music track playing throughout the whole game and it will drive you insane after the 2nd loop.

I honestly can't find a reason to play this other than getting a very blury first impression of what magic the gathering is and that it's probably best to stay away from it lol. Do yourself a favor and play real magic or Xmage. I honestly can't understand the people giving this a thumps up. Probably the kind of people going to McDonalds when they're hungry and liking every shit on facebook... | 为什么都要和炉石做对比，这明明就是鼻祖好么。

[h1]ACTUAL REVIEW[/h1]

I've invested a decent amount of time and more money than I care to admit in this game, so I feel its time to give it an honest review.

[u]Pros[/u]
+ Teaches you how to play MTG, So it's a good game to pick up for new players along with returning players needing a refresher.
+ Atmospheric campaigns that introduce you to each new set while also earning you coins.
+ Game limits your collection and deck to only one mythic, 2 rares, 3 uncommon, and 4 common cards of any individual card. This creates an artificial buffer and prevents players with too much money/time from building crazy decks that will dominate the metagame. 
+ Finite amount of cards for each set, meaning eventually you will have every card in the set. With older sets going on sale every so often to help build your collection more quickly.
+ 150 coin price tag is very fair for a booster of 6 cards. Winning a multiplayer match earns you 30 coins plus any bonuses for completing weekly and daily quests means you can unlock at least one new booster every day with a decent deck.
+ Every set since Origins has been included, and they continue to add new blocks as they come out, with some card exceptions that would be too complicated to code in a vs format.
+ All the fun of FNM, minus the smell.

[u]Cons[/u]
- Mana tapping system needs work, though there is a mana tapping key, often times it either doesn't work correctly or is just too clucky to use in the limited time you have to play your turn. Nothing is more frustrating than a match going sideways because the game chose to tap the wrong mana for you.
- Game is very buggy at times, I had to leave a match I was winning because the game refused to unzoom a card and blocked my view of the battlefield. Another time, the game froze on the ""opponent watching animations screen"" and it cost me the match. 
- Game has been out long enough for there to be enough ""auto include"" mythics and rares between all the sets to make it frustrating to play vs battles at times. I've run out of fingers and toes for the amount of times I've seen ""Combustable Gearhulk"" in any deck that has red in it.
- Game really favors the constructed format of the game, which can be jarring/frustrating for players that like to play limted formats like draft, sealed, and pauper. 
- Plainswalkers dominate the game. Some are pretty benign, but you'll see the frustrating ones enough to make you walk away from the game at times. (I personally haven't liked plainswalkers when they were introduced years ago, At least back then they were reasonable being 6 drops with something along the lines of ""+1: Target creature gets +1/+1"" not 4 drops with ""+3: Make game unplayable."")
- No In-game chat with other players. (I would probably get banned if we actually had this, I'm humble enough to know I can be a sore winner/loser.)
-All the frustration of FNM, minus the smell.

I really like Magic duels, but I also hate it just as much. I've lost count of how many times I've walked away from the game, never to play again, just to find myself back again in another duel 30 minutes later. I honestly think you need to be a little bit of a masochist to enjoy this game. 

If you like MTG, you'll feed that itch with this game. If you want to learn MTG, this game is a good jumping off point. If you want to stare blankly at the screen in a silent burning rage that could fuel a thousand suns, this game is for you."

11/10 | Gerçekten bir moda göre olağanüstü diyebilirim . Bu kadar zaman nasıl görmedim bu modu anlamış da değilim . Adeta Portal 3 tadında . Ücretsiz olmasına da ayrı bir şaşırmıştım . Portal 1 ve 2 den dolayı aklınızda kalmış soru işaretlerini tamamen siliyor . Bölümleri serinin diğer oyunlarına göre zor diyebilirim . Sanırım Wheatley'den dolayı bu ""Core""lara pek ısınamamıştım . Bu mod ise bize bambaşka ve yardımsever bir core olan Virgil'i sunuyor . Oyunun sonundaki bir detay ise Portal 2 den hatırlarsanız eğer Wheatley bizi uyandırdığında ""Dokuzdokuzdokuzdokuz... gündür uykudasınız."" gibi bir söz söylemişti.

Bunun da Half Life'da Black Mesa'ya tren ile girişimize yapılan bir gönderme diyebilirim . Portal silahımız ise ikinci oyundan daha geçmişte oynadığımız için dolayısıyla biraz daha değişik . Sonuç olarak hikaye açısından bir mod olmasına rağmen önceki oyunlar ile bağlantısı çok yüksek . Ayrıca oyun standalone . Portal dosyalarınıza zarar vermeden ayrı bir oyun olarak kütüphanenize geliyor . Eğer Portal 2 niz varsa ve bu modu indirmemişseniz bu modu yüklemenizi şiddetle tavsiye ediyorum . | It's hard to give a thumbs down to something that's both free and presented so well, but alas, the more I play, the more I dislike it, even as a get better at solving the puzzles as I've learned what's expected of me and the typical tropes. Seriously, I'm practically flying through the levels now, and yet still feel more exhausting than fun. This is compounded by the poor humor that's an inferior version of the original, coupled with bad voice acting that you're absolutely bombarded with, and also boring, amateurish music that in some cases doesn't even loop properly. I'm actually amazed at the effort though, that a free fan made mod actually went to such lengths to write new (albeit unoriginal and amateur) lines and have them acted out, but once the novelty wears thin you'll begin to find each line of dialougue more and more grating. 

Plenty of other thumbs downers have touched on the difficulty in solving the puzzles, all the while managing to make themselves sound like maybe they're the ones who are just bad at puzzles. I think it's more that the bar that this franchise has set is incredibly high, and this feels poorly designed in comparison. It isn't only that, it's in the way the puzzles are challenging that makes them feel like drudgery. Almost every puzzle has you reaching the exit only to have you turn around and realize you need to bring with you all those boxes that got you there, which just feels cheap compared to the original where most of the time getting to the exit meant success. Puzzles here feel confined and super restricted to a very narrow way of solving, whereas in portal 2 you're having fun learning new puzzle mechanics and flying around playing with physics, here there are no new mechanics so what they've done is tried to up the challenge instead. The original also had excellent pacing, mixing up the puzzle solving runs with the story/adventure parts. In this, the puzzle sections seem to drag on, especially when you solved something tough and see that you're on puzzle 2 of 12.  

Overall this is an awesome effort, I just really can't wrap my head around the fact they had multiple playtesters that were ok with the tediousness of the puzzles. It's a well presented addition to the portal story plagued by lackluster voicework/music and puzzles that just aren't fun. | This game should (and in my mind is) be part of the Portal mythos. It has amazing tests, unique characters, a whole new section of Aperture labs, and [spoiler] a good explanation for why Chell woke up [/spoiler] .

It takes something really special to leave an impression on my cold heart and cynic brain, Frostpunk achieved that.

I usually get bored with strategy games quickly, but Frostpunk sucked me in. It keeps things tight and exciting, with an enemy more terrifying than any AI-controlled army: the cold. In my first playthrough, I have made terrifying sacrifices to get a handful of survivors through the winter. With other games, I would have left it at that, but with Frostpunk, my brain kept working on different strategies even in my sleep. The next day I started again and managed to build a more gentle society that was more fit for survival. Kept hundreds of people alive without crossing any serious moral lines. I'm worried, that I can't stop thinking about more effective way to build my city and society. Maybe I can do it without child labor? Maybe there's a way for me to take in all refugees I encounter? The tight focus of the game helps my thoughts get completely lost among the opportunities. Love it.

Когда разработчики ARK: Survival Evolved решили вписаться в жанр королевских битв, казалось, что идея неплохая: битвы с динозаврами, приручение прямо в бою, выживание против других игроков – всё это могло бы стать чем-то уникальным. Но реальность оказалась печальнее.

[h2] ✅ Что в игре хорошего: [/h2]
✔ В теории – интересная концепция (если закрыть глаза на исполнение).
✔ Динозавры в королевской битве – звучит круто, но только звучит.

[h2] ❌ Почему в это никто не играет: [/h2]
✖ Мёртвая с момента выхода – онлайн просто нет, даже боты бы не стали заходить в эту игру.
✖ Кривой баланс – если ты не оседлал Т-Рекса в первые минуты, то готовься стать кормом для тех, кто успел.
✖ Отвратительная оптимизация – просадки FPS, лаги, баги, как будто движок и сам не хочет, чтобы эта игра существовала.
✖ Никому не нужна – на фоне других королевских битв вроде PUBG, Apex Legends или даже фанатских серверов в оригинальном ARK эта игра просто не имеет смысла.

Это не просто провал – это игра, которая умерла ещё до того, как кто-то всерьёз в неё поверил разработчик. С таким же успехом можно попробовать сыграть в PUBG на выключенном мониторе – хотя бы нервы целее будут.

2 из 10 покинутых серверов. | ARK: The Survival of the Fittest is the ultimate test of survival where it’s not just about fighting dinosaurs—it’s about surviving in a world where everything, from the weather to the creatures to your fellow players, is out to get you. Picture this: you’re dropped into an island with nothing but your wits, some rocks, and a stick, and you’ve got to figure out how to stay alive while dodging massive carnivores and attempting to avoid becoming someone else’s dinner. Add in some players who think they’re the island’s top predator (spoiler: they’re not), and suddenly, your quest to survive turns into an all-out, hilarious game of “who can mess with who first?” Trust me, it’s intense, but also surprisingly fun when you realize you’re a second away from being eaten by a T-Rex and you somehow make it out alive. That’s when the real fun begins!

At its heart, ARK: The Survival of the Fittest is a battle royale-style game set in a prehistoric world, filled with dangers both natural and player-made. The basic premise? You, along with other players, are dropped onto a hostile island where you must gather resources, craft weapons, tame dinosaurs, and try to survive long enough to become the last one standing. The twist? You’ll need to strategize, team up, or even betray others to outsmart and outlast the competition. It’s not just about surviving the creatures; it’s about surviving the players too. Tame some raptors, build traps, create defenses, and get ready for combat because the last survivor on the island wins. Oh, and don’t forget about the giant mutant spiders and those terrifying, unkillable bosses roaming around. In short, everything wants you dead, and you have to be smarter, stronger, and faster to avoid becoming dinner.

What really stands out about ARK: The Survival of the Fittest is the blend of survival mechanics, strategy, and chaotic multiplayer action. The vast array of creatures you can tame and use in combat adds layers of complexity to the gameplay. The game rewards strategic thinking, from deciding when to team up with others (and when to stab them in the back) to figuring out the best way to hunt or avoid the island’s mega-predators. The crafting system is deep, and the thrill of gathering materials to build your base and weapons while fending off enemy tribes is incredibly satisfying. If you’re into survival games with a high stakes, high tension environment where every decision counts—and where a single mistake could lead to an epic failure—ARK: The Survival of the Fittest is a must-try. It’s perfect for anyone who loves a challenge, epic dino battles, and the thrill of outlasting other players in a hostile environment. Trust me, it’s chaos—and it’s absolutely worth diving into! | sera que volverán los servidores alguna vez??? | Игра просто бомба от слова совсем! Я скачал ее в 4 время уже 9 до сих пор не могу оторваться. Только жалко то что играет не особо много людей человек 10 а так имба! Всем советую.

76561197976281073,346940,Shadowrun: Hong Kong - Extended Edition,0.0,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",0,"Arguably the best out of the three Shadowrun games, however let down by a lot of bugs that can be fixed by using the custom campaign feature to download the patched game in there. (It will disable achievements). It's still a fantastic cyberpunk CRPG with a XCOM like system, also comes with a lengthy post game DLC that is free. 

The game is also the most old Bioware in it's progression system and companion quests, while Dragonfall had the major elements, HK flesh them out a just enough to flesh out further. 

The true shining reason HK is the best is it's custom workshop campaigns. ""The Caldecott Caper"" and ""CalFree in Chains"" are two full sized games that use the same old Bioware like structure and are loosely connected with each other, all for no additional cost and are purely fan made. 

There is also Vox Populi, a custom campaign that back ported the first Shadowrun returns game in full plus companions and companion quests, again, for free. 

This entire trilogy goes on deep sale quite often, it's a no brainer to grab all of them when it happens, but HK is very likely the one you invest the most time in. | Best experience in the Shadowrun series and an exceptionally good crpg. Easy recommendation. | Wonderful game. Interesting story line. Felt very cyber-punkish with a hint of medieval fantasy flair. It is a stand alone game so you do not need to play the previous games by Harebrained.  Being the last of the 3 (Returns, Dragonfall, Hong Kong) it is a more polished version.

Story 8,5/10.
-time to completed was managable
-the plot twist caught me off guard
-we can choose routes (for the sake of ending we want)
-NPC quite dynamic (could affect the story a little)

Music solid 9/10
-matched every situation
-made me had this deep connection to the story and the journey

Quest 9/10
-TON OF QUESTS
-literally u could slain everything and still have other quest to do
-u can FAILED to do something and cant retake the quest until NG+ (and it would affect the story. I really like it)
-but the escort quest sucks

Exploration 10/10
-HUGE MAP
-open world
-for me to completed 1 playthrough (did main quest and side quests) and light up the whole map (only Gransys) without fast travel etc, need around 80 hours (im quite chill guy when explore something)
-there are various type of enemy and material. u can't get bored out of it
-even after 150 hours and NG+, im still not done yet. I STILL EXPLORING until i know every corner of this game

Battle mechanism 10/10
-SO MUCH skillset to try
-We can mix and match the skill we need every situation
-VOCATION SYSTEM WAS PERFECT. we can try different role and abilities
-Pawn could help us in the field we lacking (like healer/tank/DPS)
-Cool looking weapon (and have so much type)
-we can climb up the monster, so melee type vocation not gonna suffered a lot. lol

The game itself was not hard, more like challenging in a good way. but every enemy has different pattern, resistence, ability, size, speed, etc. So we need to work our brain out to survive. On the Gransys Map, we could easily win every enemy encountered, with a few exceptional. But SPOILER ALERT: on Bitterblack Isle, better prepared bcs the big guys can one-shot us lol.

The only minus was graphic, i mean this was AN OLD GAME. 1st time released in 2012 (its been 13 years), and the DARK ARISEN released in 2016. So the graphic was outdated. But that was not really a minus for me. I mean, i can feel the dynamic of every law in this game. Like the movement of the animal, the interaction between NPC, the pattern of monsters, the movement of water/wind, changing of weather, the movement of my robe when i walk or run or got drenched, etc. So an old school graphic was not a setback for me. 

At the end, this is a really SOLID GAME, even in the 2024/2025 or sometimes in the future.

The devs are extremely lucky they have an existing fan base that is loyal - and these same fans themselves admit it is more like Stockholm syndrome than genuine fun. 

Similarly to how Marvel Rivals showed gamers that Overwatch was taking advantage of their playerbase with lackluster updates and content, I truly believe the sole reason this game has managed to stay relevant is a lack of competition in the asymmetrical horror space. 

The licensing they've managed to slowly acquire over the years is what has kept them alive (just look at the popularity of anything Resident Evil related)

The toxicity is at an all time high - this may sound like nothing new to long-time players, but that doesn't make it any less true or relevant.

No matter how vile someone treats you in this game, they always act like (and believe) it is justified. 

After almost 9 years the core of this game still ONLY revolves around completing generators to escape? So tedious, where is the evolution? Sprinkling in a barely different and limited-time game-mode once a quarter does. not. count. 
 | ""Once a Thrilling Horror Game, Now a Stress Simulator""

Dead by Daylight used to be a game where you could dive in and enjoy a mix of strategy, suspense and thrilling gameplay whether as a killer hunting survivors or as a survivor trying to outwit the killer. But now? It's more frustration than fun.

As a Killer
Playing as a killer is supposed to feel empowering, but instead, you're often left feeling like a babysitter dealing with a bully squad. Survivors can coordinate so well that it’s impossible to keep up if you're not on their level. Flashlight saves, body blocking, pre-dropping pallets, tea-bagging, it feels like a playground for survivors who know the game inside out. Meanwhile, the pressure to get a 4K every match is so high that you're constantly fighting sweaty survivors who know all the best spots and have the perfect builds.

And let’s not forget matchmaking. Why am I, as a casual killer, being thrown into matches against squads of survivors with 1,000+ hours each? It’s not even close to fair. There's no real system to separate experienced players from new ones, so if you’re not already great at the game, good luck trying to improve without getting stomped over and over again.

As a Survivor
If you’re thinking, “Well, at least survivor gameplay must be more chill, right?” Nope. Not at all. Every game feels like a sweaty tournament. You either face killers that seem to have played the game since day one or ones who camp and tunnel just to secure a single kill. The fun of sneaking around, working on gens, and clutching an escape is replaced with constant stress and sweaty gameplay.

And again, matchmaking makes no sense. One game you’ll have brand-new players on your team who don’t know what they’re doing, and the next, you’re up against a killer that downs everyone in seconds. It’s chaos, and not the fun kind.

Matchmaking is the Root of the Problem
The lack of a proper skill-based matchmaking system ruins the game for both sides. Newer players get stomped, while veterans complain about having no challenge. Without a system that pairs people of similar skill levels, every match feels like a coin toss, either a sweat fest or a completely one-sided stomp.

Where’s the Fun?
Dead by Daylight was meant to be a game of strategy, unpredictability and a bit of horror. Now it feels like an endless grind of frustration, made worse by the fact that the community can be so toxic. What’s the point of playing if every match feels like a competition to out-sweat the other side?

I miss the days when Dead by Daylight was fun. Until the devs fix matchmaking, address bully squads and create a more balanced experience for casual players, I can’t recommend this game anymore.

Final Verdict:

Pros: Great concept, unique gameplay, and cool cosmetics.
Cons: Sweaty gameplay, toxic community, no fair matchmaking, and way too much frustration for something that’s supposed to be fun.
Rating: 4/10 (because I still hold onto hope that it can be fixed). | Дизбалансная багучая-лагучая помойка с самым токсичным в мире комьюнити.

Вам предоставляется возможность собрать своего персонажа в 3D по принципу фоторобота - простор для воображения, их можно делать очень разными, непохожими друг на друга. На заработанные деньги вы покупаете для них более модную одежду и аксессуары, таким образом чем вы богаче - тем круче выглядит ваш аватар.

Покупка вещей для аватара - большой плюс. В отличие от других онлайн-покеров, где с увеличением баланса ты ничего не можешь с ним сделать, а просто смотришь на свои деньги, и ""как царь Кащей над златом чахнешь"", здесь покупая шмотки, делаешь вид своего персонажа более имиджевым, и это круто.


К управлению, интерфейсу игры, и прочему - вопросов нет, все сделано удобно. Это одна из лучших покер-игр на ПК. 
Меня несколько удивил агрессивный стиль игры всех игроков в онлайне и всех ботов в оффлайне. За то время, что я поиграл, я не встретил тайтовых игроков - все играют агрессивно. 

Таким образом, чтобы выигрывать у ботов в одиночной игре, нужно сбрасывать почти все карты, а когда выпадает рука-монстр идти all-in. Что касается живых игроков, то их стратегии тоже преимущественно агрессивные. Редко кто играет сбалансированно, а тайтовой, консервативной тактики почти никто не придерживается.

Но тактики - это уже другая история. Что касается самой игры, если вы любитель покера - Prominence Poker определенно заслуживает внимания. Игра с друзьями с микрофоном может прекрасно скрасить вечер. Рекомендую!

P.S. Консервативных игроков я все-таки позже встретил. Они играют на турнирах. Да-да, в игре еще и турниры есть :)) | Leia a analise abaixo ou se preferir assista o vídeo de primeiras impressões aqui: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5bO6zor4o

Prominence Poker é um game de poker diferenciado, com  sistema de reputação, ambiente imersivo e customização de personagem.

Breve Descrição:

Prominence Poker não propõe apenas uma partida de poker, o game te leva a lugares e faz você se sentir o bandidão do poker!

Os ambientes onde você joga são fantásticos, proporcionando uma imersão que jamais vi em outro jogo de poker.

O game possui um ótimo sistema customização do personagem, você pode trocar desde a roupa do personagem até qual o tipo de bebida ele vai tomar durante as partidas.

A jogabilidade é fluida e o game esta com uma boa base de jogadores atualmente.

Lindos gráficos e ótima trilha sonora complementam esse obra de arte.

Recomendo a todos que curtem uma boa jogatina de poker, o game é muito bom!
Análise:

Pontos Positivos:

* Lindos Gráficos.
* Ótima trilha sonora.
* Inovações no estilo.
* Ambientação fantástica.

Pontos Negativos:

* Ainda não encontrei. | This is by far the best multiplayer poker game available on the PC. And the single player part of the game is also decent enough to allow you to play a casual game, or a more intense high stakes poker game whenever you want.

There are in-game MTs but those are only for chips (you get some for free every 24 hours, and the amount you receive goes up as you level up your character), which you will never need to buy, as the game provides you with plenty of chips for beating the single player modes.
I was amazed when I discovered the only part of the game that requires real money isn't even remotely essential or required in any way. It's just a bonus for anyone who wants a huge amount of chips, or perhaps a few extra so they don't have to save up for some of the really expensive character customisation items.

You can edit your characters gender, face, hair, facial hair, body, clothes, accessories (watch, ear ring, tatooes, etc), and do various amusing emojis during a game.

In conclusion as a totally free to play (from the first day you play it until the last) this is an exceptionally good game, and easily the best poker game available on PC at the time of writing this. 

I highly recommend it!

 | If you want poker, You got poker.
Very straight forward game. It does what it needs to definantly my go to (mainly on xbox thus the few hours)

Pros:
+ Very smooth interface.
+ Nice looking characters.
+ A single theme song in many styles.
+ A playerbase that wont (for the most part) go all in every turn.
+ Its FREE!

Cons:
- Strange table locations.

Its free so why not give it a go? :) | Пожалуй даже не обзор, а рекомендация.

Правила покера просты. Выучить комбинации и понять механику этой популярной игры можно за 30 минут, а вот на оттачивание мастерства во всех аспектах игры и достижения совершенства уйдут годы.

Prominence Poker хорошо подойдет новичкам, кто только знакомиться с миром покера. Собраться с друзьями, поболтать, расслабиться, создать своего чудаковатого персонажа и поиграть на складе, забитом коробками с белым порошком или в байкер-баре -  все это здесь присутствует и реализовано хорошо. К тому же присутствует система рангов и каждый может увидеть какая ты акула покера!

Не будем долго рассуждать и подведем итог:

+ Игра в стиме бесплатная (присутствует донат на одежду и прочую шушару);
+ Безлимитный Техасский холдем во всей красе;
+ Графика 3D, довольно приятная, интерфейс понятный, интересные локации для игры;
+ Возможность кастомизации персонажа;
+ Голосовой чат с китайцами, французами, пьяными русскими и т.п.;
+ Система рангов.

- Мало игроков. Иногда долго ищет игру, а на не популярных режимах типа 1х1 или турниры вообще перекати поле и ветер гуляет.
- Покерных клиентов сейчас пруд пруди и в браузере и программы. Выбор в пользу этого падает только из-за бесплатности и 3D режима. А нужно ли вам это? Решайте сами.

PS лично мне после этой игры хочется сдуть пыль с покерного набора, позвать друзей и поиграть вживую. Что и вам советую)"

It has a few flaws: Firstly, notes taking up RAM, let alone a lot of RAM. I sort of get what the devs were going for here, but all it does is encourage the player to pull  up a notepad on their second monitor, especially in the endgame when you need to juggle passwords and IP addresses for upwards of a dozen machines. Secondly, the node map. It's a cool concept but its insanely cluttered and unusable, to the point where the DLC gives you a way to sort it, so the devs know its a problem. but you just have to deal with it until you beat the dlc (intended to be played late in the main story)

It's like everything I wish ""Smugglers V"" did not exclude, like being open-ended and making actual use of its flavorful prose descriptions for stations and interactions and stories and news and stuff that Smugglers basically touts as a relatively impressive feature that I found disappointing, especially compared to Endless Sky. I prefer to opt out of combat missions like escorting science ships and luxury liners and prefer to stick with one ship as opposed to building up an entire fleet, and my list only includes the last few things I did to get to the point at which I could pass that up as an option. Oh, and there's WAY more planets and ships than Smugglers, it's not even comparable in that respect.

I got it for free, so yes, definitely worth it, but I would have paid whatever I paid for Smugglers V AND its expansion and have been perfectly satisfied. And it's still in development, but perfectly stable for me, easy to mod, and it's possible to overcome the somewhat wonky combat controls that some complain about, or at least become familiar enough to where I can fight off several (very weak) raiders (that had no business preying on almost defenseless victims) in a transport ship.

Tonight I will dream about transporting families of miners and farmers and desperate immigrants hoping to find a better life on a different alien world. | This game, where to start...

As of the Coalition's update (0.9.5 unstable beta) there's the depreciation of modules and ships to contend with. If you like the previous version, just go to the github and get a previous version.

1. Anyways: the map is big, still expanding, and has plenty as-is to offer. There's aliens, civil wars, and planets to conquer.
You can be a humble merchant, trading and hauling for steady pay. There's also passenger courier work which require the safe-keeping of those aboard to arrive at their destination. Escort duties involves distracting and attacking pirates then escaping before your objective gets destroyed. Bounty-hunting requires combat reputation, so getting a bigger, stronger ship and going pirate hunting will build up your rep to be given those high paying contracts. Or even do some of each just to make end's-met.

2. When starting out, even if you want to get a feel for the game on your own: TAKE THE TUTORIAL!!! It pays, it gets you going in a definative path, and you can buy some local maps (which it's highly recommended to just buy maps early on). Once you open up the sky with areas you have explored, do some jobs for a while within them. There are two time markers early in that you can use as reference points to gauge off of. If you manage to pay off your loan before Rememberance Day, you did awesome. If you pay it off before the Civil War, great. If you can't pay it off until after then, you may need to rethink your career choice.

3. Don't worry about goofing off and exploring or anything until AFTER you pay off your first debt (like I said before, buy some maps so you don't go stumbling about early on). If you are having problem with the Pirates, stick to the middle and 'north-west' part of the map and do trading. If you are in the mood for salvaging or capturing ships, aim for the 'south-west' area around Aldhibain (five jumps 'south south-west of Rutilicus/home-planet) since there is both a strong merchant & local milita and Pirate raids. Also, the planet within the Aldhibain has both an Outfitter & Shipyard along with the trader, so you can not only sell the parts you get, you can sell any captured ships, equipt any modules you aquire or buy new ones when you get the money for them.

4. Lastly, once you upgrade your ship (anything over $million should do) go explore and visit each unexplored spot. Can't reach there? No worries, you will soon enough. If you prefer a more peaceful venture (aside from Pirates) visit the 'north north-east' area. Want to fight some tough enemies? Visist the 'east' area and say 'hello' to the new-comers (with several salvos of cannons). Once you unlock advanced flight, throw yourself to the far corners of the galaxy and discover all there is to this game.

5. ...then finally, once you do everything this game has to offer: quit it. Yes, quit... for a few months, go play something else,  do real-life things.

6. Then come back and find new contents has updated... then you can start a new save and play through the whole thing in record time.

7. See 5, 6 & 7 for further instructions.

 | How is this game free? I have no idea. Could easily be worth $20 or more. 

One of the greatest aspects of this game is its ease of organization and navigation. There are so many ships, weapons and stars that you could very easily get lost and frustrated trying to remember where everything is had the developers not taken that into consideration. You can see the prices of everything in every system and where every piece of equipment you've discovered is sold. You can access everything's stats to plan out trips. | Absolutely incredible. Some people see ""2D"" and leave. Not me. I love space, and I love this kind of game. The commerce is relaxing, and the combat is intense. This is what indie games should be. Better than NMS AND FREE! Would be 10/10, but -1 for no music."
76561197976281073,410380,HEX: Shards of Fate,0.1,"Adventure, Free To Play, RPG, Strategy",0,"The purpose of this review is to help you determine if HEX: Shards of Fate is a good fit for you. There are a number of quality games on Steam that receive negative reviews simply because they don’t fit the head-shape, budget, and/or difficulty level of certain players. If you really want the TL:DR of this review, go and look at the number of hours played by the positive reviews compared to the number of hours played by the negative reviews. I am a 41-year-old professional with a full-time work schedule. As an avid PC gamer that can no longer keep up with the demands of traditional MMO play times, HEX has been a blessing for me. I have been absolutely enamored with the game’s PvP and PvE and I have been steadily improving thanks to a very helpful community.
 
THE PAY MODEL

In order to make a proper determination whether or not HEX is the game for you, you should first understand what this game is and how the pay model works. HEX: Shards of Fate is a trading card game with various PvP and PvE formats. The client can be downloaded without making a purchase and some basic cards as well as all PvE formats can be played free of charge. Additional cards are purchased in packs on a per-pack basis just like real world trading card games like Magic and Pokemon. Cards can be traded among players and bought and sold on the Auction House for either of the game’s currencies. There is Platinum which is purchased with real money and used to buy packs and VIP time, and Gold which is earned by participating in PvE. HEX is not intended to be a Free to Play game. It is a virtual trading, collectable card game that shares aspects of real life card games. In order to fully utilize and appreciate what HEX has to offer you should expect to invest a significant (but reasonable) amount of time and money.

THE ECONOMY

Cards can be bought and sold for both Platinum and Gold on the virtual Auction House. Platinum is originally purchased with real money and is used to buy packs and VIP time. Gold is earned mostly in PvE.  Gold can be used to buy auction house items, Stardust to make cards ‘Extended Art’, and to ‘roll’ on treasure chests which are obtained by buying pack and completing PvE tasks. The HEX economy very nicely allows players with varying preferences of PvP and PvE to exchange desired virtual items. The modest VIP program is free of any Pay-To-Win rewards. Also, you should be aware that there is a robust ‘unregulated’ secondary market where players can sell their collection for real world cash. It’s unsanctioned by Cryptozoic and provides a way for players to receive some of their cash investment back if they decide to move on. This might seem shady at first but it’s akin to going in to your local hobby shop and buying and selling cards there. I put $400 in to Hearthstone and ended up hating the game but since you can’t freely trade cards, I have no way to get any of that back. 

PLAYER VS. EVIROMENT

PvE in HEX currently features two modes of play. There’s a Campaign where you can pick a champion, explore the map, and raid solo dungeons. The other mode is the Frost Ring Arena where you compete with AI controlled champions. The AI difficulty level in both modes is intentionally set at ‘easy’ to ‘medium’ in my estimation. The ‘dumb’ AI is a negative for some players that want a more challenging PvE experience. For most players however, PvE is a form of grinding and the challenge is to figure out deck and equipment designs that can farm the quickest. My favorite aspect of PvE is the Equipment system. Champions can equip certain pieces of armor and weapons that give cards in their decks powerful attributes. It’s a brilliant system that allows for the design of fun, powerful decks in PvE without creating balance issues in PvP.

PLAYER VS. PLAYER

HEX has a number of PvP formats that appeal to a variety of players based on their tastes. There’s Constructed modes that allow a player to use any PvP eligible card in their collection and there are Gauntlets and Draft mode where players use only cards that are obtained by opening packs. Constructed Mode is highly competitive and since players can use any card in their collection, you will need to make an investment to earn the cards that will allow you to be competitive. You can design budget decks that will help you advance up the ladder but you’ll need to invest and collect some nice cards to be a solid competitor. For players that prefer a more ‘level’ competition there’s Gauntlets and Drafts. Cards in this mode are obtained directly from packs that are opened for that tournament. The cards obtained are completely random for each player and it’s up to you to design the best deck possible. After the tournament concludes, the cards obtained are added to your collection and can be used or traded as you see fit. 

THE COMMUNITY AND DEVELOPERS

The community is one of the major selling features to me and is why I enjoy HEX so much. There are a number of excellent guilds <Insert Shameless Plug for Cornerstone> and well-produced guides in the form of videos and blogs. The players here are mature and helpful. Any game with PvP will attract ass-hats of course, but in the two months I’ve been playing, I can count on one hand the number of rude comments that I’ve encountered in chat during a match. The Twitch/Youtube community is excellent and quite often coordinates with Cryptozoic Entertainment. For instance, during the latest patch, a second, pre-patched server was set up so streamers could highlight the upcoming changes during down time. My perception is that Cryptozoic communicates with the player base often and they understand the concerns, needs, and wants of players. I like their transparency regarding their policies and I think their financial model is fair and well done.

CONCLUSION

Like many of you I suffered a long period of MMO’s that became P2W and games that were released too early. I’m truly grateful that I found HEX. Cryptozoic Entertainment is a smaller developer and there’s content and quality of life improvements that all of us want sooner rather than later, but at the end of the day, this is an excellent product. If you’re looking for a hobby to sink your teeth in to or you’re considering trying your first TCG, this is the game for you. HEX is Grade A, bonafide Trading Card Game with gorgeous artwork and easy to learn, difficult to master gameplay. I hope you give it a solid try!

Edited for length conformity. | В первый раз пишу отзыв об игре, но тут прям уже наболело.

Пытаюсь начать в эту ОТЛИЧНУЮ игру почти с самого ее старта, и никак...
Это наверно единственная игра, где я потратил столько сил впустую.
Хочу сразу сказать, что я не TCG профи, есть опыт игры во многие подобные игры на уровне казуала, не более.

Что же предлагает нам HEX чтобы начать играть?
1. Полностью донатный вариант - покупаем платину, на нее покупаем паки и плату за вход в соревнования.
Один пак стоит на ауке около 160 платины.
Вход в драфт стоит 3 пака и 100 платины = 580. Это около 300 рублей.
И было бы ок, но первые 20 раз новичек в драфте обречен на слив. Потому что нужен опыт, которого бесплатно взять в этой игре НЕГДЕ. Вот и приходится платить за сливы.
2. Вариант компромисный - 100 платины покупаем на реал, 3 пака фармим за голду. Могу сказать четко - это бред. 1 пак стоит 25к, в пве хоть какую-то прибыль дает арена, за фулран зарабатываешь 6-7к в 40 минут. Я пофармил, и получается что на один драфт нужно фармить примерно неделю онлайна. То есть ты тупо гоняешь одних и тех же боссов неделю за то чтобы один раз зайти в драфт и слить.
3. Ну больше вариантов нету. Либо ты хорошо драфтишь (гантлетишь) и с первого доната уходишь вверх... либо ты всю жизнь гоняешь компьютерных болванчиков в ""данжах"".
Я бы очень хотел, чтобы была какая-то подписка, рублей за 400 в месяц, которая давала бы хотя бы один вход в турнир в неделю бесплатно. Это была бы хоть какая-то точка старта. А так получается, что там играют одни папки сами с собой.

И я вообще слабо понимаю, зачем делают эту кампанию. Заработать там нельзя, карты для пвп или входы в турниры получить нельзя. В чем вообще смысл то??
Все эти разговоры про ""рейды и гильдии""... Это типа будет собираться 10 человек и мочить компьютерного ОП бота? Не знаю кому это интересно. 

Еще раз, я хочу сказать что я не против платить за игру. Но в текущей реализации - это просто не оправданно. | HEX is by fantastic example of what can be achieved by a true trading card game in the digital space. The quickest way to descibe the game is Magic: The Gathering with a threshold based resource system and unique mechanics that would only be possible in a digital TCG. 

You preserve everything offerred by physical CCGs such as complete open trading system and third party support and add to it a digital auction house, in-game tournament support, ladder system and a respectable single player experience (although admitiedly still shallow compared to their Kickstarter promises) which adds a somewhat viable way to enjoy the mechanics without spending any money.

That is to say, HEX's F2P avenue requires an extreme amount of luck or time if you want to construct some of the most potent PvP decks via only the PvE content. Time in grinding the PvE content until you have enough of the PvE currency to trade for sealed tournament entries and luck in that you do well enough in those sealed tournaments via wins or opening cards that sell well to pay for the next entry fee and make a profit.

To give some perspective to that a sealed tournament entry costs generally $5 and gets 2 boosters ($2 value each) with the potential to get 3 more boosters if you do well enough. Simply getting 1 win gets you an additional booster so that already would put you ahead on base value in addition to keeping the cards you open. In additon, there are multiple rare cards that sell for $1+ and some of the top end cards can go for $20+. If you get lucky enough to snag some of those and sell them on the AH or on the Trade channel you can keep yourself running tournaments for a good while.

I have always been a stickler for dropping money into an online game and not having anything to show for it if I stop playing, but since HEX fully supports trading and third party sites if you ever want to cash out your account you can and depending on how much effort you want to put into selling off your collection you could even turn a profit.

In the future, HEX has promised to flush the single player experience out into a full multiplayer PvE experience with raids and dungeons for players to team up against. Not sure how far off this is and a number of Kickstarters are salty about the delay (rightly so), but as it stands now I fully recommend HEX as being the only digital TCG out there that has a comprehensive feature set, friendly community (Twitch & Reddit) and enjoyable complex strategic gameplay. | I am a F2P Beta player, and have spent many hours grinding the PVE content to build my collection. I have tried a lot of different card games, and Hex is currently my favorite.

GAMEPLAY
If you know how to play MTG, you know how to play Hex. It is your standard “mana” driven TCG. It fully takes advantage of its digital nature, summoning cards from outside your collection, permanently modifying cards, and even completely changing cards in play. This adds a huge layer of strategy as deciding to kill a 1/1 creature by doing one damage or giving it -1/-1 matters when the card remembers its stats even in the discard pile!

ECONOMY / COST
The game has two currencies, Plat (real money) and Gold (in game money). The only time you need Plat is when entering tournaments, everything else can be bought with Gold.

The game has an auction house and the ability to trade with other players. It is a true TRADING card game as opposed to a COLLECTIBLE card game. You can turn Gold into Plat by trading with other players or selling cards in the auction house. 

It is easy to grind Gold, you can challenge the AI in the Arena and get progressively larger rewards for winning (and even if you lose, you keep everything you won up to that point). You also have the campaign which continually rewards money and cards.

STABILITY / LAG

For the most part, the game is stable with reasonable performance. When a new release or event begins, the performance may suffer due to the increased load, but the developers usually handle that fairly quickly and increase the capacity. In my time playing, the performance has gotten better over all.

A few deck strategies are also particularly taxing on the game, such as spider based decks which create massive amounts of creatures. This can be mildly annoying, but usually isn't game breaking. 


TOURNAMENTS
There are regularly occurring constructed and sealed tournaments. There are even queues which you can enter and play at your leisure over days instead of playing all at once. Entry fee is inexpensive and winning gets you packs.

Constructed - This is your standard tournament. Build a deck and play to win. I avoid this as those who spend money clearly have an advantage.

Draft - A fairly well designed mode though there can be a lot of waiting involved. Players draft from a common pool of cards so everyone is on equal ground. The problem is you can have players who simply take the rares for their collection.

Sealed - This is my favorite type of mode as everyone starts on equal footing and you keep all the cards. It is particularly fun to play in “Gauntlet” mode as you can play your 3 to 7 games over however long you want, the pool of opponents constantly refreshes.

PVE / Adventure Zones
Last but not least is the PVE content. You choose a race and class which grants you special abilities and a starting deck. You then travel the world facing various challenges as you help your faction win a war. You can also hire mercenaries which provide you with even more options.

You can play this fairly effectively without spending any money. The opponents are interesting, and there are special PVE cards which are much too powerful or random for PVP games. This also earns you gold which can then be used to buy packs or enter into tournaments. 

I strongly recommend Hex! | This games is very addicting. I never thought an online battle card game could be this fun! 

Pros: Beautiful graphics. Great story line. More control of your cards during battle. I love how you can advance your character with skill trees and customize your deck and character with socketable cards and sets of gear.

Cons: The battle can be a bit tedious at times, especially when you are first starting out. There is not a way to cancel or change your actions before finalizing them (or at least not one that is readily seen).

Overall, this is the best card battle game I have played. It is a bit complex and challenging, but the balance of the complexity and story line/game content is well enough that the player stays engaged."

76561197976281073,268500,XCOM® 2,0.0,Strategy,0,"amazing tactical gameplay and challenge. XCOM 2 and WOTC are so different it is like 2 different games which makes replayability even higher. One of my favorite games. I would give 10/10 | After my 3rd attempt, I was able to beat this game, and I didn't really like it. The game is cruel, unreasonably hard and very disrespectful to player. 
At first, the game bombards you with a ton of non-skippable events, missions, messages. While you trying to figure out what's going on, they put on a timer on you with this ""Project Avatar"" thing, and you immediately feel a lot of pressure. Some missions are just crazy difficult, like those for Serpent King and Mad AI factory, and you don't expect this difficulty this early in the game.
Mid-game you finally have a chance to catch some breath and start working on some research, building and engineering, but here's the catch: the moment you get better in the game, the moment you upgrade your weapons and armour, the enemies suddenly become more powerful and armoured. You just don't have a chance to enjoy powerful things that you've made, because they quickly become just what is expected by default.
The end game comes unexpectedly, with a lot of pressure on you. It consists of two consecutive missions with no pause in between. If you got some units damaged in the first mission, you either will have to replace your best units or send them in wounded. The final mission is crazy, the amount of extremely powerful enemies is over the top, and it carries a lot of stress.
Given that the game is flawed with bugs in controls, has dumb battle mechanics that lead to absurd situations and very challenging overall even on lower difficulties, I would not recommend this game. | Le jeu en lui même est ok, War of the Chosen ajoute énormément au gameplay et est un incontournable pour XCOM 2. je vous recommande aussi d'utiliser des mods. Long war of the chosen est vraiment incroyable et ajoute énormément de difficulté. Le jeu peut être un peu frustrant mais n'oubliez pas qu'il est normal de perdre dans ce jeu !
Une pépite de stratégie au tour par tour comme on en fait plus.
 | XCOM2の面白さを語るには、前作にして名作 XCOM: Enemy Unknown (以下XCOM:EU) と比較すると分かりやすいと思う

まず前作のXCOM:EUからあらゆる面で順当に進化しておりボリュームも増した
Steamワークショップ対応でMODも充実と欠点なし！と、損は無いのでセール時にはぜひ買ってプレイしてほしい

以上を大前提とした上で、そう⋯700時間以上もプレイ（最高難易度を最小部隊人数でクリア済）した上で私個人の見解を言わせてもらうと
XCOM:EUよりもゲーム性（ゲームとしての楽しさの意）は落ちてしまったと感じる
XCOM:EUはXCOM2よりも飽きの来る要素が多いはずなのに⋯だ！
※EUでは敵の配置が一部完全固定だったり⋯etc

繰り返し遊ぶゲームとしてみるとXCOM2の方が優秀なはずである
ではなぜ私はXCOM:EUの方がゲーム性が高いと言えるのか？
XCOM:EUのゲーム性はまるでパワプロなのだ
パワプロもメインイベントは決まった日に起こるはずなのに、何度もプレイしても楽しい

XCOM:EUではストーリーの進行と、ミッションが適切な間隔で詰まっており
兵士の計画的な育成（＝ビルドを組む楽しさ）と、時間制限（＝敵の更新／強化）
のバランスがすごい良かったのだ
そしてランダム性が少ないことが→上手くなれば、あらゆる要素を縛っても戦術で勝てる
など良い方向に働いたりした

一方でXCOM2では、多くの追加要素により楽しさも増したが、
その分ストーリーとミッションの関連性が薄れ、またタイムリミット枠の選ばれし者たちの介入は、
戦闘を長引かせる良くない要素の一つだと思う
選ばれし者自体はすごく面白いのだが、3人は多い！ゲームのかさ増しになってしまってる

ストーリーとレジスタンスの尻拭いを交互にやらされるのも間延びする原因だ
XCOM:EUでは助ける国と、見捨てる国の切り分けも緊張感を煽る良いスパイスだった
XCOM:EUでの上手くなるは「ゲームオーバーにならなければ見捨てて/切り捨ててOK」だった
XCOM2では上手くなると「滅亡カウンターがやばくなってきたから、そろそろ助けに行くか～」と、どの難易度でもなった
侵略されてXCOM:EUより悲惨なはずなのに、なんか緊張感にかけるのである
追加要素をプレイさせるために、滅亡までの時間にどうしても猶予が出来てしまったためだ
この点がゲーム性がXCOM:EUより落ちてしまったと感じる部分だ

難易度が上がると、どんどん無駄を減らすプレイングが重要で、駆け抜けるようなゲームプレイ感になるXCOM:EUと
研究や勢力や選ばれし者など、たくさんの要素からどっしり構えて戦略を練っていくXCOM2とプレイ感が違う
そしてたまたまXCOM:EUの方が私に合っていただけなのかも知れない

色々言ったがXCOM2のMODでの拡張性と、それに伴う豊富なキャラクリは本当に最高なので
みんなもお気に入りのキャラを作ってプレイしよう！
キャラに愛着が湧けば湧くほど、そのキャラが死んだ時に楽しいぞｗ | 2015 I graduated University. 2016 the game came out. For many years, I didn't have the time to play the game, or would like to spend 90 dollars on the game title at the time. 9 years later, it's 5 bucks on discounts, and it plays just as well as when i was continuing from 2015 from XCOM 1. Highly recommend this game to be played by people. That and my potato Intel i3 cheap laptop from 2021 runs the game just as nice, even at the lowest display graphics (with a little longer loading time)."

This game is the meme that keeps on giving and I will forever cherish it. ♥️ 

It's also legitimately fun to play, not just funny. I found Civ 6 so bloated and busy with its many menus and DLCs that it sort of turned me off. I was surprised to return to this fossil of a game and then have more fun with it overall. Civ 3 also has a couple of features that aren't in the series anymore, like having a city view, designing your palace, the civ leaders and your advisors having a wardrobe update every era, ... it has spirit, it's a vibe. | Ich hatte mal wieder Lust ein richtig gutes Cvilization zu spielen!
Und das für nur 99 Cent statt 70 Euro. | People call civ 4 the ultimate classic civ, but honestly, civ 4 is more of a weird inbetween than it is a true classic game (which IS why it's the best one) This however, is probably the best true classic civ game. CIV 1 and 2 are really fucking old and dont really even run on modern systems, and their UI is nightmarishly old. this game was the first one to have a functional UI, and somehow, is still better than civ 7's on launch despite being from 2001. it's also extremely moddable. | Классика, игра моего детства, которая до сих пор остаётся в сердце. Все части, что выходили (и выходят) после неё кажутся ""чем-то другим"" или ""чем-то не тем"".

It has always been a favorite of mine.  When I saw steam had it I quickly purchased it as it was a no brainer.  This game is straight from the orignal game, pixels and same writing.

Bom, esta é a primeira vez que jogo um Sid Meier. E tenho que admitir que, contra minhas expectativas, fui positivamente surpreendido.
Além de seguir acontecimentos reais, o jogo oferece várias possibilidades e estratégias. Além do mais, mesmo sendo totalmente leigo, como é meu caso, ele é bastante intuitivo, mesmo se depois leva tempo para dominar.
Ao mesmo que oferece diversão, oferece desafios para todos os gostos.

A Solid 9/10 and absolute classic. Have loved it since it first came out and now later in life. I just wish one issue technically/strategically/in terms of game design was fixed. If this was fixed the game would be perfect 10/10. 

As you build up your army organically against the King its population value can sometimes too drastically lower Rebel Sentiment to initiate the Revolution. So you could have towns that are in the high 90% of being pro Independence and being ready to go yet the Overall Score is stuck in the low 30%. This is completely lopsided and after I did everything right with the right buildings, founding fathers etc. 

In essence it's too much of a trade-off between growing your population/army along with maintaining the popularity needed to initiate the revolution. This SHOULD NOT BE A TRADE OFF! This catch 22 problem means you can't win the game as reasonably due to Strategy/Design Error. The best way to fix this is to remove Military Units from the calculation of Rebel Sentiment entirely. 

I have made comments on this issue in forms, on STEAM, along with others. Yet it doesn't seem to be fixed anytime soon. Sad given such a great game."

76561197976281073,65980,Sid Meier's Civilization®: Beyond Earth™,0.0,Strategy,0,"An under rated entry in the Civilization series that unfortunately didn't get the support it needed from the developers. The idea of a desperate mission to another planet to colonize it and save the species is a hell of a starter. Choosing what to bring to ensure your success was something that needed to be expanded on but wasn't at launch. Another problem was too many people made parallels to Alpha Centauri thinking it was a reboot of sorts and the devs didn't do enough to dissuade people from that idea.

It hasn't aged well, but I still think it's in my top 10. | Играл во все цивилизации начиная с первой, но эта со своим DLC Rising Tide просто космос. Лучшая часть из всех, пятая и шестая рядом не стояли! Не думаю что и седьмая будет чем-то лучше чем эта. | It's not *bad* per se, but it's not good either. There's a lot of stuff here that's just an objective step backward from Civ 5, even very simple UI stuff. Take for example the small bar that runs along the top of your screen in Civ games. This is used to display basic information, like what resources you have, what your general happiness level is, how many trade routes you have available and how many are active, etc. 

For some reason, in Beyond Earth they chose to REMOVE the trade routes from this bar. Now if you want to see how many trade routes you have and which are active, you have to click on ""additional information"" and then select the trade route overview. The ""additional information"" button is also on the bottom right now, along with spy overview and a bunch of other things. It's completely flipped from Civ 5 (and Civ 6), so it constantly throws your brain for a loop because you're not used to going to the bottom right corner for information. 

Diplomacy is also kind of a mess. From what I've been able to tell so far, there isn't actually a way to trade for resources. Your ""trade"" agreements with other civs are more like small-scale research agreements, and what you can barter for is dependent on the civ's personality. For example, Al Falah seems to be focused on production because their agreements give you stuff like an increase in energy yield for your capital, letting you build worker units for free, etc. It's not bad, you can get some useful stuff, it's just odd that you're not trading for actual resources. I don't have any Firaxite, but the American Reclamation Corporation does. Why can't I just ask to trade for it? But what can be much worse is your actual relationship with other civs. If you are ""cooperating"" with another civ (this game's equivalent of being friendly), you may be tempted to form an alliance with them. For the love of god, DO NOT do this. I made the mistake of proposing an alliance with Al Falah and was IMMEDIATELY thrust into a war with every single civ they were at war with (half the civs on the map). 

Then there are other mechanics that are just half-baked. The xeno wildlife is this game's version of barbarians, and the *idea* behind them is cool. Most of them aren't outright hostile and they'll leave you alone as long as you don't get too close. You can destroy their nests to keep them from spawning if they're in the way, but that can be risky early on. They're all connected by a hive-mind so it'll make the rest of them REALLY mad at you. Conversely, you can research an ability that lets your explorers ""leash"" xeno units and make them your own (there's also research that let you produce your own xeno units). The problem is, leashing wild xenos is mostly pointless. They're quickly outpaced by normal military units, and you can't upgrade them. For example, the xeno cavalry unit is just humans riding on raptor bugs. If you leash a few wild raptor bugs, you *should* be able to upgrade them to cavalry units once you've researched alien domestication. But you can't. Why? I dunno.  

Most of the game is like this. There's a lot of neat ideas here, but none of them were ever fleshed out. Firaxis only released one small expansion for this game and a map pack, then promptly abandoned it. | Actually a lot of fun and way fewer bugs than CIV VII | I want to like this game but it crashes literally all the time. It is super unstable and currently unplayable for a huge number of people. I keep trying to play it, and it crashes every time I load a world."

Y e s.

I highly recommend this game. | 整體來說，這是一款很糞的網頁遊戲
玩法相當於放置類遊戲，完成任務要花時間掛機，每日進來有每日獎勵
離開前可以當守衛掙錢(當守衛時無法做其他動作，時間到就可以領取獎金)
而完成任務和當守衛拿到的錢可以用來升級、換裝備等等
然而，除此之外就沒別的遊戲內容了，非常之貧乏
這個遊戲唯一目的就是升級，然而升級這件事不但無意義，無獎勵，而且很空洞
沒有任何突發事件，沒有值得把玩的系統，無法認識其他npc，沒有任何故事，當然也沒有任何CG
你可以去競技場和地牢，戰鬥和做任務一樣都是自動進行
而升級也是除了等級數字上升以外，沒有任何差別
你在5級和20級得到的體驗是完全相同的，裝備就是換個圖給你，點力量幸運智力之類的會影響角色戰力
但戰力怎樣一點都不重要，喔你在地牢打贏了?來給你錢，拿去升級
說真的，你是免費遊戲，設計一堆圈錢機制我都不會有意見
但你這麼無聊──我連花錢的慾望都沒有──
花錢買香菇以升級?那你給我把升級這件事做好玩一點啊──
升級會影響的只有排行榜，可是我又沒想在排行榜上占一席之地，前一萬名和前一百名在我眼裡都一樣
而且那又不代表技巧好或腦袋好，那只代表你花很多錢
樂趣在哪裡啊?
事實上，我之所以會一路掛到35小時，只是因為我想看看要塞是幹嘛的(25等開放)
在發現要塞的功用是挖掘材料，以升級其他建築物，好幫助角色升級之後
我便決定棄坑了
(其實還有寵物系統，75等開放，我懶得看了，想也知道會和其他系統一樣空洞)
說真的，如果有紙娃娃系統，或是能夠布置角色的房間之類的，我也許還會在留久一點
但......可惜沒有，話說我也對我的角色沒啥一體感
除了捏臉還蠻有趣的之外，我就找不到其他好玩的地方了
一開始玩還能得到生產什麼的感覺(放置遊戲的特色)，但現在就只剩下膩味了
因此，這個遊戲只推薦給以下的玩家:
想體驗一下奇幻背景rpg放置遊戲的玩家
不想看英文的玩家(有簡中)
閒閒沒事幹的玩家
可以下這個遊戲耍廢一下，除此之外的都不推薦

ps.之前不知道為何桌面的檔案無法滑鼠雙擊打開，只能利用Enter開
直到我發現只要這個遊戲開著就會有這個現象
又多了一個棄坑的理由(爆) | Tahle hra je jedno velký kolo co se jenom točí..

-jak jsem říkal..vše se točí dokola | Centrum życia każdego poszukiwacza przygód jest oczywiście Karczma! To tutaj znajdziesz wędrowców szukających śmiałków gotowych wypełnić różnego rodzaju zadania, za które otrzymasz doświadczenie, złoto oraz, od czasu do czasu, jakiś magiczny przedmiot. Do wyboru są zawsze trzy, czasem mocno zwariowane zlecenia, jak np. wyprawa na morderczego królika. Wprowadzają one element humorystyczny, dzięki któremu nie tylko dobrze się bawimy, ale także często uśmiechamy na widok pomysłów, jakie zaserwowali nam twórcy Shakes & Fidget.

Waszą postać możecie rozwijać na dwa sposoby. Pierwszy z nich to zakup ekwipunku dostępnego u lokalnych handlarzy. Znajdziecie u nich szeroki wybór magicznych przedmiotów jak zbroje, bronie, eliksiry, amulety, a nawet legendarne artefakty, które znacząco wzmocnią siłę waszego bohatera. Drugim sposobem są punkty doświadczenia, dzięki którym rozwiniecie swoje statystyki - pamiętajcie jednak, że każda z trzech profesji rozwija się i walczy w inny sposób, dlatego np. Wojownikom potrzebna jest raczej wysoka siła niż inteligencja, a Łowca powinien skupić się na zwiększaniu zręczności.

shakes-and-fidget-1.jpg

Jeśli znudzą wam się walki z komputerowymi potworami możecie wyruszyć na miejscową arenę, na której toczą się bitwy PvP. Możecie stoczyć pojedynek z losowo dobranym zawadiaką albo przeglądnąć listę innych poszukiwaczy przygód i samemu wybrać sobie przeciwnika. Dzięki temu wypełnicie tzw. klaser - im bardziej jest on zapełniony tym większy bonus do zdobywanego doświadczenia. Dla najbardziej leniwych poszukiwaczy przygód przewidziano pracę jako wartownik, jednak ten typ roboty powinniście podjąć tylko wtedy, gdy udajecie się spać lub np. idziecie do szkoły lub pracy.

Oprócz rozbudowanych elementów RPG i dużej ilości humoru Shakes & Fidget może pochwalić się też bardzo fajną, komiksową grafiką dodającą grze sporo uroku. Tytuł ten jest w pełni po polsku i zapewni wam wiele chwil dobrej zabawy, jeśli tylko lubicie luźną rozgrywkę i klimaty fantasy. | Shakes and Fidget is a free to play animated web browser RPG with asynchronous multiplayer and everything RNG.  It is an international web browser and mobile game, so it will be populated with many other players. This game is translated into many languages, so there will be many Non-English reading players.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok, was understandable.  It is light on resources used, so it will be runnable on any computer.

Has funny quest text and gear descriptions.  The artwork is cartoony and funny. Has varied weapon sounds. Has some animation.  Has a manual and official wiki in English.  Pretty Easy to play.  

The level cap is 600, but it will take you long time to reach it, very TIME consuming game.  (At my current hours, i have a 144 scout and 135 warrior)  Quests and other things take an amount of real time to complete or cooldown reset.  More time you put into it, the higher you climb on the leaderboard.

Mushrooms are the store currency, but you can earn some from quests rewards and gambling.   Some gear cost mushrooms, but you might find the same and better later for gold only or quest reward.   You can spend mushrooms to skip waiting on timers or add time to questing endurance and the best mount.   There is hourglasses that you can buy with gold for skipping the travel time on questing.

It has PVP and PVE.  It is RNG combat where better stats and gear will give you some edge, but RNG is a fickle goddess, you still can lose to bad rolls. Difference in Level between you and target is a factor of success. You can make 2 characters per accont, picking one of 4 classes ( warrior, mage, scout, assassin).  Has an PVP Arena where you have a choice of 3 players to attack for gold, honor and xp.

You can raise your all your stats with gold and use potions to temporary improve a stat.   Gear you can buy or get from quests can now be modded in the blacksmith shop and in the tavern watercloset. At level 75, you can collect Pets that improve your stats and you can fight other players pets. There are many other things that you can do to improve your stats.  

It has 31 dungeons you can unlock and raid.    Finishing Frost Blood Temple Dungeon, you unlock The Tower which gives you three companions (Mage, Scout, Warrior) to raid with through 15 harder dungeons that unlock with the Tower.  You have to outfit your three companions with gear to improve their stats.  But ends up having to wait for your level to catch up to the dungeon level.

You can make your own fortress, with some buildings that improve your character and other building for protecting your fort or raiding others forts.  You can raid other players forts for resources and pour your gold in to defending your fort.  There is an Underworld that you can build and other players can raid. It has Guilds and guild wars, where guild members all attack other guilds or defend from other guild's attacks.  Guilds have stuff they can build that increases gold and xp gain for guild members.  But above level 25 guild upgrades require someone that Buys mushrooms.  You can increase your guild level also by completing guild house raids. 

The 22 plus servers are located in Europe somewhere (Central Europe time zone).  Devs keep adding more servers, which pulls active players from the established servers.  Leading a guild is easy but hard to get enough active dedicated players to reach the very top of the guild leaderboard.    

Try it, maybe you might like it.  You can play this game for free, and it keeps you busy several hours a day.

 | +The main feature of this game is that it can be played by twitch streamers whos subscribers names appear in the game.
-While this is neat, its mostly just a gimmick to promote free advertising for a bad game design. If the game was actually fun to play and interesting to watch someone play, this would be a good thing, except its just the opposite.

-The problem is the UI. The UI has sliders hidden behind button menus whose sole purpose for being in the game is to make you micro-manage those sliders. This creates an artificial difficulty level, unless you constantly pause the game and waste unecessary real time. This seems to be done purely to distract, annoy, and frustrate the twitch streamer throughout the game. Its as if it was designed for a phone using a touch screen and not a twitch streamer. Rather than making the game actually challenging- you will find yourself struggling mainly against the UI as the the sliders I mentioned earlier are pureposly designed to waste your time. On top of that you must click spam constantly to be effective and there are no hotkeys to activate your skills in the game. So you must click constantly, then stop clicking and click a skill. 
By the way, when you stop to click a skill you stand still and you can be repeatedly knocked down by enemies and this interrupts your skills, putting you in an unaviodable death loop if you are knocked down a single time near a decent group of enemies.

-Strange coincidence? The troll ""gallops"" and steers and breaths just like a horse. Also, what troll lives in a castle? Pretty sure this orignally was a game about a knight on a horse defending from orcs rather than a troll.  Its so obvious that its painful. Its almost as if there was some last minute changes due to lack of funding, a artist willing to complete the unfinished assets, or a copyright claim, or some other barrier. Its hard to believe this was done intentionally, but either way to me its a red flag signaling bad decisions.

-The game runs at 24 fps no matter what graphics setting you run it at.

-The whole stream to decide wether the game would be free or not is laughable. Its should be fairly obvious that this was the only option they had to get anyone to not refund the game within the time limit and to attempt to get a larger audiance to pay for the DLC. A good strategy.

-The real troll is the game developer for implimenting these poorly crafted systems and actually expecting someone to freely promote this painful experience by streaming it. I mean it would be a great marketing strategy, if it was actually a good game. Instead, its a dull experience that doesn't end. Due to all of the repition of the core game loop the game becomes a grind that only becomes less appealing.

+If the UI is ever completly redone, hotkeys are added, and the core game loop becomes less repetitive, with zero need to pause, it might actually work out. Check back for version 2.0 or 3.0 etc if they are still working on it, but with so many problems I wouldn't get your hopes up. What seems more likely is that another developer will try a similar idea and do it properly. | Great game, regardless of if it's free or not... it's just a perfect mix of tower defense, strategy, and RPG elements in an easy to pick-up and play package.

If you ever played a TD, you will generally know how to play this game with the basic un-intrusive tutorial.

If you ever played a Diablo-esque hack-and-slash, you will know how to control the giant troll and activate skills.

The game is simple, yet fun.

Get the game for free, buy the costume pack to support the devs who stuck by their word and desided to give this game away for free to the publics, and enjoy a great game that looks perfectly fine even on the lowest settings (like in my case, as I was playing this on a non-gaming laptop as opposed to my built gaming desktop, not really expecting much).

So no, this is NOT a great FREE game... it's just a great game that I got because it was free, and then enjoyed a lot more than what I thought I possibly could. | A really fun game! Protect the little guys, upgrade their settlement and upgrade the big guy! Not very long, but its free! | A surprise free to play game that was fun and challenging, tower defense mix with some strategy and a little town management."
76561197976281073,438920,Legends of Callasia,8.933333333333334,Strategy,4,"With some games, we tend to concentrate on all sorts of factors that seem important, and overlook the one that's the most important of all - fun! This game is just great fun to play! I kind of enjoyed the free version, and figured it was worth the punt at what's a pretty reasonable price. I have quite a few digital board games in my library so I was just expecting this to be another to come back to from time to time, but I was pleasantly surprised that it immediately became my new favourite game.

As has been mentioned, it's basically a beefed-up version of Risk, and the short review is, if you like Risk, you're going to like this. The only major differences are:

[olist]
[*]you [b]improve[/b] territories you own, either with a town or a tower (or the odd portal from time to time) for most territories, or several upgrades for the main cities;

[*][b]heroes[/b] - armies only move around the map attached to a hero. You'll generally have 2 to 4 heroes wandering round the map at a time. Each hero has specific stat buffs - some are defenders, some have missile bonuses etc.

[*]each map is a [b]scenario[/b] with specific objectives, and various factions that you either fight or ally with. You don't have to take over the whole map and conquer everyone (although you can if that's your thing!)

[*] there are [b]cards[/b] that you can play for certain specific effects, some combat-related, some economic, and so on, and using the right card at the right time can have a huge impact.
[/olist]

To address some of the specific criticisms that have been made against the game:
[olist]
[*][b]Graphics[/b] - I think this is pretty misguided, to be honest. It's a digital board game, not some cutting edge 3D/VR title! The graphical style is charming, quite cartoony, and in any event, it looks a damn sight better than my old Risk board!

[*][b]Multiplayer[/b] - don't know, haven't tried, don't care. For some people, multiplayer is the only thing they care about, but this is a perfectly good single player game. You might be able to rush through it if you really want to, but I see I've already clocked up 30hrs and I'm only at the start of the second of 4 campaigns. That's pretty good value for money! (I admit I do like to take my time with games I enjoy, so I don't just rush to complete the scenario objectives in as short a time as possible, I like to take over the entire map and improve every single territory, just because).

[*][b]Complexity[/b].... Some people have said it's too simple. Listen, I love strategy games, but if complexity was the be-all and end-all of every strategy game, we'd all be sat playing Gary Grigsby's War In The East 24/7 and poring over 1,000 page instruction manuals trying to sort out problems with diesel distribution in the eastern Urals. Complexity [i]can[/i] be good, but sometimes you just want a nice straightforward game that's [b]fun[/b] to play without needing a degree in tactical theory. Someone pointed out that it's ""only"" got 6 unit types per race (which funnily enough is how many pieces there are in chess, and no one ever criticises chess for being too simple!) and ""only"" 4 races (so that's one more than Starcraft, the greatest strategy game of all time - yes it is, don't deny it).

Ha, I've just noticed that War In The East is one of the ""More Like This"" games for LoC, that's a stretch!!

[b][u]In Summary[/u][/b]

Reminds us that, in an age where we're in danger of obsessing about graphical engines, fps, always-online multiplayer ranking and impenetrable manuals, there's one thing that trumps [b]everything[/b] in a game - is it fun? This game is fun.

Oh, and if you like Risk [b]at all[/b], this a no-brainer. | If you purchase this game it will NOT unlock anything beyond the free-to-play level. The game's servers have been down for a year and you can't play even the single player campaigns. STEAM will not refund you your money if you spent more than 2 hours playing the free levels before purchasing. 

I've been a STEAM customer for a long time and this is $30 stolen disappointing. I'd dispute the charge on my card if it didn't risk my STEAM library. | Originally I got this game on iOS for my iPad.  I liked it so much I told friends about it and bought it for my PC.  We enjoyed many hours of fun together.   It had cross platform support, so my hours played far exceed the amount shown on Steam.

I bought the DLC and the campaign story lines were fun to play.  Multiplayer was fun too.  But I NO longer can recommend this game.   Months before I wrote this review the game devs disabled the server required to log in to play the game.  Yes this game uses a DRM tied to an authentication via their server.  Without that the game has become COMPLETELY unplayable.  I load it up and get a black screen because it cannot connect to their server.

I recommend no one waste their money on a game that is unplayable.   I've given the game devs months to fix this problem.  It's a shame because I would still have dun playing this game otherwise. | This game appears to be broken currently.  I was able to play the first mission in the campaign, and tried to start the second mission, but nothing happens.  I can click the ""start"" button, the mission is unlocked, but nothing.  

The account creation doesn't work either.  Yes, you're prompted to ""create an account"" to play a single player game, and yes ""logging in"" to play your single player game doesn't work.  Since the game is a few years old, I'm betting the ""authentication servers"" are down, and that's that then.   The in game ""feedback"" button also fails to do anything.  There's a nice little place to send feedback and problem reports to the devs in the game, but of course it doesn't work anymore.

A bit annoying, since the first mission that did work, wasn't half bad.   I'll check back in a bit to see if any dev responded, but I'm guessing this is completely dead, even the single player part!  So if you thought this might have looked cool, even in the year of our lord 2021, you might have been right, but it doesn't matter because it's broken.


 | Another one of these games, that looks amazing and seems to offer interesting gameplay. But after you get into it and dig deeper (you know after you completed the demo and bought the full game), you notice it's was just all an illusion. That everything that there was to see and discover, you have already seen. 

For a stragegic game it brings one of the most awfull and lazy AI approach. The computer opponent is dumb as a rock, and to balance that, it is usually given absurdly idiotic edge in starting resources and position. This is what's called 'fake' difficulty. A human player given such advantage would crush any opponent without problems. 

I mean literraly in many cases if the AI opponent just took his starting troops and heroes and marched straight on my starting city, it would just be over.  Another thing that did irritate me in a campaig, are the arbitrary conditions like ""capture this in x amount of time, because of, well reasons..."" 

The only difference between the factions are in the units.

Overall it is not as if the game is terrible, it is just terribly disappointing.

Oh yeah, and I almost forgot, why the hell do you need to create some account to unlock further missions? I BOUGHT the damn thing already."

There are only a few options for what you can do each turn with your gold, but learning to use them to their best advantage will take a little time. There's also a certain amount of luck in the game; a better strategy will help you to prevail against an equally-lucky or slightly-luckier AI, but at certain key points bad luck can just overwhelm you. At the price, this is a good game. A few more complicating elements might have been enough to lift it to being a great one, but it meets its limited ambitions admirably. | Un petit jeu sympathique que n'importe quel PC (ou pratiquement) pourrait faire tourner.

En fait il ne l'est même pas.

The player with the best luck in the first few battles will win.
Even a great strategy won't compensate initial luck.

If you like strategy, avoid this game, it will annoy you.
Try it if you want a small little time waster. | This game is absolutely fantastic, until it isn't.

Bad news first. The game makes no attempt to grab your attention. There's little penalty for failure, which made me remarkably apathetic about a map's outcome. The skill ceiling is low and quickly reached, so no satisfaction in overcoming a challenge. There's not a lot to discover; any new elements that come into play usually don't have enough impact to make much of a difference, and you rarely need to change your tactics because of the map. There's no story to reach the end of. The art suffers from a serious case of Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V, so no eye candy incentive. The RNG influence made me feel like I wasn't too involved (a particularly bad example was an aquatic map I had to play, made almost entirely of island territories. Due to the limited income and the expense needed for fleets, I had only one attack per turn until I was the dominant player. If the game decided a territory wanted to rebel, too bad for me; I justed wasted a turn, nothing I could do about it). The music, while not unpleasent, is repeditive, unimaginative, and forgetable. I'm not saying these are all problems. Rather, it's them in combination. There's a lack of something interesting, something motivating, or just SOMETHING.

All that said, this is a wonderful timewaster. I was able to get into a game literally within seconds of booting up. Within a few minutes, I was devising basic strategies. Everything is intuitive; what needs labels has labels, what doesn't, doesn't. The AI is smart, yet fallible. For instance, a very simple system that makes AI more likely to attack you if you attack them also leads to them ganging up on the most aggressive player. And since the most aggresive player tends to be in first place, the AI prioritizes very well. If the game needs to explicitly explain something to you, it can do so in a brief sentence before each map. There's also plenty of room for experimentation during gameplay; a defensive strategy tends work, until someone finds (or makes) a hole in your plan. And since the AI tends to concentrate on strong players, there's plenty of wiggle room to go from 4th place to 1st. The difficulty scales perfectly, with advanced mechanics and strategies possible in early levels but not required, all without obstructive UIs or crypticly secret mechanics. There's a lot more, but since the game is free, you should play it yourself. You'll enjoy the surprise.

There's a few minor, quality-of-life things that need addressing. The apparent lack of fullscreen support leaves me with a box-shaped window with minor clipping at the bottom edge. It doesn't cut off anything, but it's still annoying. While I like how the tip about keyboard shortcuts comes up after you're familiar with the basics, I'm a bit dissapointed some very basic controls are hidden there. Until I learned of the menu about an hour into play, I was closing and relaunching the game to restart the map.

In short, the game is a skeleton. It's well put together, but there's no meat on those bones. What type of meat doesn't matter, it just needs some good meat. As is, you'll probably find it fun in short bursts, but not engaging enough to keep your attention to completion."

It has ARPG style tiered loot collecting, with rarity tiers for weapons and such.  And it has Egosoft / X-series style industry and economy.  The economy isn't fully ""alive"" but it does model supply and demand as you build and destroy factories.. and it has a lot of side quests and boss fights at each stage of the game to keep you busy.

The ship building is pretty basic, not like Space Engineers or anything like that.  But simple and to the point, you can get creative or you can fly a brick.

Graphics are decent, but could be better. But that is not what the game is about.

Pros:
Customize spaceships down to the smallest block. Even turrets can be custom.
Nice gameplay. 
Fights are fun if you turn up the difficulty level.
You can - but don't have to - own and manage multiple ships and space stations.

Cons:
Production system is half baked and has a lot to ask for.
Trading is botched to the point I consider it broken (but there are other ways to earn money).
Resource management is largely inconsistent and in dire need for an overhaul.

The building is incredible, the automation is well thought out, the different difficultys add great replayability, the variety of factories and ways to make money / resources keeps things fresh, and the combat is fun.

Tried it on a whim with a friend a few years back, was amazed at how incredibly fun it was. Played it all the way through.
A few years later, got the itch again and dragged a load of new friends on it. They all love it, we're playing a second playthrough and are at the final boss again. We have also discussed doing a separate playthrough on much harder difficulty.

 | 玩腻了SC2?WAR3天梯顶端独孤求败？想补玻璃渣的经典游戏但是又由于不会设置或者新系统对DOSBOX处理效果不太友好而不得不放弃？用Stratagus编写的RTS完全可以弥补这点遗憾。到目前为止，除了你现在看到的Wyrmsun以外，还有利用Stratagus再现的WAR1\SCBW项目（官网），以及MODDB上的WAR2 RISE OF SHADOW项目。
回到本游戏，Wyrmsun可以说完全再现了WAR2的多项特征：双种族，相似的科技树，单位造价甚至都很像。青出于蓝之处也很明显：一次框选27个单位，单位可以自主升级，地图上的很多元素都可以互动，可升级的科技也很实用。
一定要说缺点就是AI平庸，包括寻路AI以及AI对手的战术思路脚本，为了弥补战术AI的不足，Stratagus有AI无限资源脚本（注意是引擎的锅），战局越是拖到后期，对人类玩家越是不利，所以，和AI对抗，发现AI基地后，没有必要扰矿，可以适当游击干扰，能够四BW爆骑士解决的不要拖到后期，2333333

=====================================
2018.5.10更新：
老实说：我最初是想更新为差评的。
尽管在我买下了游戏不久，本体就免费了（？？？？？.jpg）
不过作为补偿，我得到了作者赠送的新DLC（老DLC也完蛋了），尽管这些DLC只是加了涂装而已。
不过，作者本着对游戏负责的态度，坚持更新到了3.0时代，此时又追加了一个完整的、可玩的哥布林阵营，并且后续还会有更新。就整体完成度来看，这是除了Stargus和War2gus以外，在Stratagus引擎上完成度最高的游戏（没有之一）。
还是和之前一样，如果你想追老war2，建议不要再用DOSBOX一类的玩意来折腾自己了。这个完全吸收了现代RTS对于操作的简化，同时保留了老WAR2的风味。 | It reminded me of Warcraft 2.
It gave me same feelings as I was kid and launched that game for my first time.
And it has deep and more complex stuff.
It's cheap and it's fun.

I had a battle with AI, it lasted for more than 1 hour.
AI spend all his gold and couldn't afford swordsmen and started to zerg me with farmers. They started to steal my resources! I was mad at them.
After a long sick battle I finally got up on my feet, prepared my army and send them to destroy that big deserted village AI has abandoned, I felt sweet revenge and anger, it was final task to complete this quest, a few more hits to that building and win and... CRITICAL ERROR. Yup, I had my laughs about it, I was so into it I forgot to save the game. | Open source oldschool RTS based on the good old Stratagus Warcraft-based engine.

It's a card game where you play it like a board game and it's up to you to predict what your opponent is going to do and try to react accordingly. 

The most unique part of this game is that you play FOUR cards at ONCE. Every turn, both players! And there's no mana. If that doesn't get you at least interested, I don't know what to say.

People talk about grind in f2p, (which is what put me off of HS) and grind is part of RuneScape, so that label almost put me off of this game. Which I think happened to a lot of people, and that's a shame. 

If you're looking for a fun, free-to-play card game with some twists and isn't a chore, here it is. | C'est dommage ce jeu avait tout pour se démarquer :
- un système de jeu original différent réellement des autres TCG
- une ambiance originale
- des cartes bien équilibrées offrant des possibilités de decks vraiment très nombreuses
- une économie saine pas de pay to win, de vrais boosts réguliers pour les f2p ou juste ceux ne désirant pas lâcher leur salaire tous les mois dans des boosters

Mais :
- Jagex a presque été silencieux depuis le début, et n'a quasiment fait aucune promo, et n'a organisé aucun tournoi (TCG = esport et spectacle en streaming de nos jours, sans ça il y a vraiment une perte de valeur)
- n'a quasiment rien ajouté depuis sa sortie
- a laissé traîné des sales bugs sans s'en occuper et qui au bout d'un an de jeu deviennent plus qu'horripilants
- a fini de tuer ma motivation avec l'ajout de bonus f2p obligeant à se connecter tous les jours sans en rater un seul... (quasiment tous les éditeurs ont compris que les gens avaient une vie à côté des TCG et qu'il pouvait arriver qu'on ne se connecte pas pendant plus de 24h, me^me pour récupérer un bonus... d'autant que ce système à la noix est un système de f2p mobile qui s'y adapte beaucoup car on peut ouvrir ces jeux et récupérer les bonus en speed entre deux portes même si on n'a pas le temps de jouer...)

En gros, pendant longtemps, j'ai recommandé ce jeu, mais aujourd'hui un constat doit être fait...
Le jeu est plus ou moins à l'abandon, la communauté, même si motivée ne fait que rétrécir, et aucun effort ne semble vouloir être fait pour résoudre les anciens bugs et planifier le futur. 
Donc, devant le nombre de TCG de qualité de nos jours, je ne peux pas recommander ce jeu, même si ça me fend le coeur, et moi-même je lui dis Adieu aujourd'hui, le coeur gros du gâchis d'un si bon jeu. | 好游戏，暂时没有遇到网络爆炸，你在发现卡顿了就退出重上就好，不会说中途网络爆炸断线什么的。如果重上卡顿的话。。。找别的游戏玩一下......另外，为啥不能在游戏里充值？！

Para os veteranos que se lembram do original, é um mimo nostálgico imperdível.
Um game obrigatório aos jogadores que buscam jogos de ação. | [h1]DOOM Review: A Masterclass in FPS Revival[/h1]

DOOM is nothing short of a triumphant return to form for one of gaming’s most iconic franchises. From the moment you tear through your first demon, it’s clear that this game isn’t just a reboot—it’s a love letter to the original while boldly forging its own path.

The gameplay is fast, fluid, and unapologetically brutal. The emphasis on movement and aggression creates a relentless pace that’s as exhilarating as it is empowering. Glory kills add a visceral layer of satisfaction, rewarding you for diving headfirst into the action instead of cowering behind cover. This isn’t just another FPS; it’s a pure, adrenaline-fueled experience that reminds you why shooters became so popular in the first place.

The level design is another standout feature, with sprawling, labyrinthine maps that encourage exploration without ever losing momentum. Hidden secrets, upgrades, and collectibles provide plenty of incentives to comb through every corner of the UAC’s Mars facility and the hellish depths beyond.

Mick Gordon’s thunderous soundtrack deserves a special mention. The heavy metal score doesn’t just accompany the gameplay—it amplifies it. Each riff and beat syncs perfectly with the chaos, driving you further into the carnage.

The story is refreshingly simple yet surprisingly effective. It knows it’s not the main attraction and instead focuses on delivering just enough lore to keep things interesting. The Doom Slayer’s disdain for protocol and corporate nonsense injects a layer of humor that contrasts beautifully with the dark, gritty setting.

Visually, DOOM is stunning. The environments are detailed and atmospheric, while the demon designs are grotesque in the best way possible. Every battle feels like it’s taking place in a heavy metal album cover brought to life.

In conclusion, DOOM isn’t just a great game—it’s a reinvention of a genre that many thought had lost its edge. It’s fast, ferocious, and endlessly fun. Whether you’re a long-time fan of the series or a newcomer, this is one hell of a ride you don’t want to miss.

Rating: 9/10. | amazing fps game really nice graphics, sorta short but thats better than it dragging | pos muy buen gameplay el mejor juego que eh jugado y es tremendo para matar demonios si estas enojado por que tu profesor te puso un 3 y ala puta de la gorda de tu salon le puso un 10 por la de anoche pos desaogate con doom (perdon por la ortografia ni ganas de escribir tengo)

The game is a challenging, strategy oriented card builder that takes quite a bit of wit and honestly a LOT of luck as well.  You can build a custom deck to fit your playing style and to counter different AI strategies but in the end you'll very rarely get better draws then them, even with a well built custome deck.  The game is geared toward the AI and its way obvious, which is understandable considering its a free game.  All in all, interesting game, but the AI is garbage and almost feels like your being cheated against practically every game but if you decide to give it a try, I hope your not an impatient person or get frustrated easuly because if you are, then you'll want to break you're PC playing this one. | Tiene el peor tutorial que he visto en mi vida. Malísimamente explicado el juego.
Es muy simple, con una mecánica original y dinámicas directas: uso una carta que solo se responde con una carta y listo.
Aunque tiene un set de cartas limitado y cerrado, las numerosas formas de ganar hace que puedas armar tu baraja con diferentes objetivos.

Pros: 
- Una mecánica de juego de cartas muy interesante, te hace salir de los TCG normales para entrar en un verdadero juego de cartas de estrategia.
- El apartado visual está muy bien cuidado para dar una sensación de era medieval muy completa.
- Fácil de aprender y muy profundo para explorar.

Cons:
- El peor tutorial de la historia. Literalmente quiere contarte cómo jugar mediante una historia, que se olvida totalmente de explicarte el juego... El tutorial debería ser 1 sola partida que te dice qué hace cada carta y listo, pero pierde un monton de tiempo explicandote estrategias antes de decirte cómo funciona el juego.
- Los sonidos y la música tratan de darte un hambiente relajante, pero termina durmiéndote, es muy aburrida y está en un tono exacto que te puede provocar dormirte en medio de la partida. | Really wonderful game. Clever and Elegant. It takes some effort to learn the rules (but not that much actually), bat then you have really a gem to play with. The quality of the software is also great! And it is free!! Unbeliavable!!!! | Ortus Regni is a nice little card game that unfortunately has not got a lot of attention.
It does not offer a huge variety of cards but the game has enough depth to keep you interested for a while.
It's more of a casual game than it is competitive one and in my opinion that is what makes it interesting, because you can sit and play it without really having to be focused and thinking ahead all the time while still having a certain depth in the gameplay.
Since it's free and it's decent i suggest you try it. It personally gave me 2 good hours of gameplay.
Overall recommended.
 
Update: Well i played the game some few more hours and i got to say it has much more depth than i thought it had. Again, i recommend it, especially if you are into card games. | j'aime pas.."

I'm glad it's free, it's awesome but could be better with more sound effects and voiceovers.
I definitely think we should be able to save multiple game sessions.
 | Es un juego muy versátil basado en el universo de Lovecraft. Me gusta la rejugabilidad que tiene, dentro e las distintas historias existen pequeñas variaciones entre una partida y otra, también depende de que personajes elijas y creo que eso le da más opciones al juego en sí y al que lo juega. | Внимание! Mansions of Madness - это не игра сама по себе, а программа-дополнение к настольной игре с тем же названием. Без коробки с настолкой под рукой она может служить разве что в качестве ""визуальной новеллы"" без какого-либо челленджа, поэтому если у вас этой коробки нет, я, разумеется, не рекомендую ни скачивать ее бесплатную версию, ни тем более покупать DLC.

Выложенное на Steam цифровое дополнение к Mansions of Madness призвано упростить процесс настольной игры, принимая на себя функции гейм-мастера. Она сама рассказывает историю, подсчитывает наносимый персонажам урон, каждый раз по-разному располагает комнаты в поместьях и подсказывает, куда какие карточки класть.

В программе содержится 15 бесплатных сценариев (при первом запуске игроку доступны четыре, остальные открываются после того, как вы войдете в настройки и укажете, что обладаете расширениями к оригинальной версии настолки - программа не запрашивает доказательств и верит на слово, правда, открытие новых сценариев требует времени на их скачку с официального сайта); еще три сценария можно докупить в качестве DLC.

Итого: не то что бы обязательная, но очень приятная бесплатная программа-компаньон к настольной версии MoM, которую в отрыве от нее можно использовать только в качестве не самого удобного текстового квеста. Перед покупкой DLC убедитесь, что ваша версия настолки соответствует требованиям дополнения. | Bueno, habrá que jugarlo más, porque la primera partida puede ser bastante liosa debido a la complejidad de las instrucciones: Estuvimos jugando mal un buen rato, hasta que nos dimos cuenta, por otras referencias, de que no podía ser como lo estábamos haciendo. No estaría de más un módulo de ""aprende a jugar"". 

Entre eso y que no fuimos buenos estrategas, se nos triplicó el tiempo estimado de partida. Aún así conseguimos ganar, más que por méritos porque nos aprovechamos de la lógica que seguían los monstruos para entretener a cuatro con una huérfana...

Pero creo que la peor parte es la jugabilidad: La aplicación es tan dependiente de la caja que se vuelve todo un poco absurdo. Si te dejara al menos seleccionar a los jugadores con los que estás haciendo la acción, para que te tirase los dados, por ejemplo, o te ordenase los mapas de alguna manera para buscarlos rápido, o los objetos únicos los mantuviese en pantalla para no tener que andar buscando cartas...

En resumen, me parece una app de apoyo, que da poco apoyo adrede, para que dependas sin sentido de la caja en cosas que bien podría hacer el ordenador de manera opcional, según los jugadores quisieran activar unas funcionalidades u otras.

Habría preferido una app más funcional que no dependiera tanto, aunque en vez de ser gratuita necesitara un código de Steam único para cada caja. Y el que quiera prestar la caja, que comparta su biblioteca.

Aún así a mí me encantó, pero veo fallos, y otros jugadores los vieron demasiado graves. | Superb replacement for the keeper. AND you can also be the APP keeper if you wish. Kidding aside, they need to come out with MORE DLCs! More sound effects, voice overs, monster death sounds, monster attack sounds and animations, ETC; i don't think players would mind more atmosphere ... Also, it'd be nice if during resolution of tests or combat that you don't know what happens if you pass or fail until you confirm if you've succeeded or failed. Lastly, It'd be really nice also to add a ""Create Your Own Scenario"" mode that you can create, save, and possibly share your own homebrew scenarios.

76561197976281073,481180,System Crash,61.25,"Indie, Strategy",24,"Decent enough cyberpunk aesthetics and story, but the gameplay is absolutely garbage if you have played more than a couple card games. The most basic possible mechanics, four lanes that autoattack with mana that scales automatically each turn, draw 1 per turn. Pretends to have more going on but the ""objective"" system is literally just life points but they count up instead of down. I had hopes from the intro, but every mechanical explanation depressed me further. Additionally, for a single player game, the drip of new cards is absolutely pathetic. It takes a couple dozen missions to be able to do anything you might reasonably call ""deckbuilding"", and meaningful synergies are at least 8-10 HOURS in. 

In the finer points, the hard control cards are also maddening. At the beginning there aren't that many, although the control for support cards is ubiquitous among the opponents, so playing the expensive ones is largely pointless. After you get to the point of ramp cards, hard unit removal, and lots of haste (no summoning sickness) cards showing up, it starts to feel more and more pointless to try and develop a board. The deckbuilding interface is also trash, with no search function for attributes, so building based on the synergies that exist is an absolute chore, and rebuilding your deck for specific enemy challenges is a pain in the ass. I was immediately turned off by the mechanics of this game, but I felt I had to give it a fair shake before leaving a negative review. The lazy card game mechanics just keep coming. Unless it's hiding 12+ hours in, there is nothing of interest you could find in this game that hasn't been done a thousand times in better ones.

Here are several much, much better games you could go play right now:
Faeria
Solforge Fusion
Runescape Chronicles (there's a fan run free version even since it's dead)
Netrunner (physical, still worth it, and if you want the cyberpunk theme, there's none better) | Highly recommended!

For me, this is one of the better CCGs:
- intuitive to pick up, there's quite some variation in cards and effects but nothing crazy (not like some not to be named CCGs that require a 15 page glossary to play)
- the mix between combat damage and ""hacking points"" is brilliant, it avoids that whoever drops the biggest creatures wins and also forces a certain pace in the rounds
- the layout is clear and works beautifully
- once you get past the initial rounds and have some credits to spend on customizing your deck, it becomes much more interesting and gameplay becomes much more varied; the initial rounds of both campaigns can be tough but a little deck adjustment goes a long way
- everything in the game from the story to the artwork, the cards and their effects all fits perfectly with the cyberpunk theme

RNG does have a significant impact but there's no penalty for losing a battle and the rounds are quite fast, so it's not that big of a deal.
There's the occasional hiccup when the game locks up but for the same reason, this is not a big problem.

I would have loved to have a few more campaigns (still need to try the Underworld DLC) but then again, I'm sure I will play though them several times more, trying different decks and approaches. And the arena mode is ideal if you only have a few minutes to kill."

You can have an experience playing against IA, but forget about challenging a mate, forget about challenging people online. Yeah, even if you paid for that.

Interface gives headaches, with constanty moving in and out from the cards. There's no alert when (if ever...) a game starts, if you manage to start a game it will disconnect a dozen times in a round.

I don't blame the obviously underpaid developers here. But honesty, these mistakes are expected from newbies. | Unfortuately, there isn't a neutral option. 
The game is pretty fun, once you figure out the mechanics. but absolutely zero effort was put into campaign mode. You get 8 lousy scenarios, and for an extra $5, you can get the ""full"" game with 8 more for a total of 16.  That's it.  You also have the option of replaying them in hard mode, or playing the AI on Easy or Hard mode in a straight up battle with no modifiers. Whee.

Even if they didn't bother to throw in different cards, there should have been at least 3 to 4 times as many scenarios, with at least a few changes in level-specific modifiers to spice things up. One modifier in the game prevents you for buying purple cards, another makes Initiates cheaper for everyone, or the AI gets all card prefilled prerequisites. All this code is already in place, the only thing they would have needed to do is  switch it around every few levels. It wouldn't have been that difficult to make the game significantly longer. As it it, it feels unfinished, and nowhere near worth the price they're asking.

If you can get the Full game (with the expansion) for under $5, go for it, but as it stands, this game feels like they got it to the point where it was working physically, but forgot to go back in and add any actual content. | Really fun and addictive.

The mechanics are all quite cool, but for me the entire design falls apart on one fatal flaw. I usually play these kind of games to do some quick up to one hour long runs in the evening. However, with this one, two evenings in a row, the runs ended up in a lengthy slog that almost lasted past midnight. And the worst thing was that the gameplay did not even change very much during those 2+ hr long runs, I just eventually felt like I was doing the same thing over and over again. The resulting boredom and loss of concentration (which is highly required ALL the time or you will lose fast) made me perform worse, so I did not even win in the end.

Idk, it just feels like it is a game for a different, more slow-paced era than this one. There are just so many more interesting games of the same genre, that spending 50+ hours to unlock most the different content of this one seems highly unlikely for most gamers imo."

Коли зомбі виявляються меншою проблемою, ніж сама гра
State of Decay 2: Juggernaut Edition – це яскравий приклад того, як можна взяти цікаву концепцію та перетворити її на повний провал. За сім років розробки гра не просто не вдосконалилася – вона деградувала до рівня васянської 
модифікації.

Що намагалися зробити:
• Створити імерсивний світ постапокаліпсису
• Запропонувати унікальний мікс менеджменту бази та виживання
• Реалізувати драматичні сценарії зіткнення з зомбі

Чому провалили:
1. Технічний жах: Гра буквально дратує багами, що унеможливлюють проходження, скриптові помилки, які блокують завершення кампанії.
2. Графіка часів динозаврів: Освітлення настільки погане, що ліхтар перетворюється на прожектор, який світить крізь стіни. Здається, дизайнери ніколи не бачили реального світла.
3. Зомбі-конвеєр: Дизайн інфікованих настільки одноманітний, що створюється враження, ніби їх ліпили under copy-paste. Також ніяких нових виродуів, як було 4 так за 7 років їх і залишили.
4. ШІ від лобової атаки: Союзники поводяться як самогубці, вороги мають супер приціл, а зомбі думають виключно про те, щоб з'їсти Вас ігноруючи інших.
5. Сюжет – повний абсурд: Написаний, здається, під час тривалого похмілля. Навіть найпримітивніші діалоги здаються образливими для глядача.

Особливо ""принципові"" моменти:
• Доповнення Daybreak – це навіть не DLC, а знущання над грацями
• Бойова система з живими ворогами – повна халтура
• Персонажі настільки картонні, що їх можна використовувати як декорації

Висновок:
State of Decay 2 – це не гра, а симулятор розчарування, та розсадник якісної халтури. Я б рекомендував кращі варіанти такі як, Project Zomboid або 7 Days to Die.

Оцінка: 3/10
 | State of Decay 2 – це гра, яка зачаровує своєю атмосферою та інноваційним підходом до жанру виживання. Вона пропонує гравцям захоплюючий і водночас напружений досвід боротьби за виживання у світі, де кожна дія має наслідки. Хоча гру важко назвати бездоганною через технічні недоліки, вона залишається чудовим вибором для шанувальників зомбі-тематики та кооперативних ігор. Ще великий мінус за відсутність Української локалізації та доволі швидко гра стає однотипна. Рекомендую якщо розумієте Англійську і маєте друга який буде з вами грати тому що грати одному не дуже. | State of Decay 2’s open-world battle for survival against a zombie menace is the right kind of post-apocalyptic fun. It creates plenty of high-stakes moments, punctuated by the relative calm of foraging for supplies while always looking over your shoulder. It’s a potent mixture for a while, until the combination of repetitive missions and annoying bugs eventually dulls the joy of squashing heads, even when your co-op entourage rolls deep.

Just like in 2013’s original State of Decay, in State of Decay 2 you can freely switch between randomly generated survivors in your post-apocalyptic community – and you’ll regularly have to, because they can only be pushed so far before their stamina starts to give out. Or worse, you did something stupid and got someone permanently killed, taking their unique traits and whatever leveled-up skills they’ve acquired with them. You’re not able to customize their names or looks at all, which is a shame, because if XCOM has taught us anything it’s that it’s fun to tell your friends and co-workers how you got them killed. But that fear of loss (you can’t reload from an earlier save!) adds some significant weight to the struggle that plays out on one of three open-world rural maps, as you scavenge the region to build a shelter and work to cleanse the land of a disease known as the Blood Plague. | 一个上线几年的游戏 怎么汉化还有问题？体验也太差了 | It's a fun enough open world Zombie game for putting dozens or even hundreds of hours into until State of Decay 3's release."

【第一印象】
发现这个游戏的时候是我真的闲的无聊看看免费游戏，结果就发现了！
本人很喜欢像素风（8-bit）的游戏！还有RPG类型的！
开始玩的时候，新手教程是“老练囚犯”，当时就觉得这个人物好好玩。
接着又打了几盘人机。电脑跟你打从来不怂的，1V3的时候经常有，开局一会儿就三杀了。每次死了一两次后都会想“要不我也像电脑那样不怂？试试看”，结果每次都是送送送……
最后一盘就是占领祭坛（反正我是这样叫的），每次都有电脑跑去站，然后我就一直骚扰，每次都把他打死在祭坛里面，还是占领不了……心疼自己智商。

【游戏趣味性】
1.像素风（8-bit）。如果有一点点信仰的玩家第一眼都会喜欢的吧。
2.游戏模式。稍微有一点点枯燥，就是杀杀杀，DieDieDie。希望官方以后出一点娱乐模式or剧情模式（就像RPG类做任务）~
3.关于游戏里的人物。三个（还是几个记不住了）周免人物，没有玩过的人物可以练练手。如果有自己很喜欢或者玩的很溜的人物，但是又只是周免的，可以考虑花一点点钱（比如“老练囚犯” 6R），买一个人物。如果所有英雄都喜欢或者玩的溜或者信仰充值或者单纯喜欢游戏或者想支持作者的可以买下40R的DLC！说真的40R的DLC不算贵！一顿饭钱~（我只是推荐大家花点小钱支持作者，并没有提倡说不吃饭买……）

【好评的理由】
1.免费游戏好伐？！这都不给好评？游戏素质也还算不错！
2.像素风（8-bit）这点就给很多信仰玩家加分！
3.很多人物，很耐玩。
4.电脑的智商在我的眼里还算蛮高的。
5.DLC40R良心好伐？不想花钱玩人物的也可以在游戏里刷游戏币买啊！
6.很多关卡、很多技能、武器，应该来说玩不腻。（上面我说的游戏模式枯燥指的是单纯杀杀杀枯燥啊……）
7.占的内存很少……300MB，对于我这种渣渣宽带来说so easy。
8.支！持！简！体！中！文！

【差评的理由】
1.服务器问题真的很大好伐。欧洲服务器300ping，到亚洲服务器直接到了600ping，突然感觉我是欧洲人了呢！（并不，还是非洲的）
2.人物、技能平衡性有点差。具体什么情况还是自己玩玩，就知道了。

【总结】
大概就差不多了~反正我很喜欢这个游戏，已经准备花钱购买人物了。
信仰充值。
玩这个游戏，走位很重要啊！！！蛇皮走位！！！拿象拔蚌去走位都可以！！！

毕竟作者花了这么多时间去做游戏，开放是免费的，也就只有DLC赚赚钱。还是一句话，支持作者，让作者有把游戏完善下去的动力！

【感谢。】

3.19.2017 修改评论。 | 運営にやる気があるようでこまめにアップデートされており、新キャラクターも短期間で多く追加され、不具合も改善され、キャラ相性はあるものの強キャラ弱キャラの差はそこまで感じず、公開初日からこのゲームを見ているが初期に比べるとかなり良ゲーになった。
しかし公開されて数日間サーバーの不具合によってオンラインに他の人の部屋が見えないという、オンライン専用ゲームにおいて致命的な不具合があったため最初にプレイ人数を獲得できなかったのが痛い失敗かと思われる。
その為今も人数が足りずチームランクマッチ戦がしにくくなっているが、個人ランクマッチやフリー部屋やドラゴン討伐部屋等は機能しているので十分楽しめる。

簡単にまとめると、

～良い点～
・良アップデートがこまめに行われる
・キャラクターが多い(2017/1/27現在15体)
・キャラバランスが良い
・不具合修正が早い
・全キャラに別コスチュームがある(アプデにより3つ以上あるキャラも)


～悪い点～
・不具合内容が致命的な物が多い(サーバー接続不可、壁に埋まる等)
・プレイヤーが少ない
・ドラゴン討伐の難易度が高い(人によってはやりごたえがあり良い点)
・対戦中に抜ける人が多い
・ゲーム内マネーが貯まり難い(最近はデイリーボーナス実装で少しは集めやすいかも？)


2017/1/27現在の最近の評価が「賛否両論」となっているが、人数不足からきているものだと思われる。
ゲーム内容自体は非常に好評でもおかしくないので、評価を見るより先に一度プレイすることをオススメしたい。 | Upon first impression, this game appeared to be a sort of dungeon scroller type game. But once I started playing this game showed it's true colors. A quirky 8-bit styled MOBA that introduce a wide range of characters. Liked the intuitive tutorial, but later found the game to grow a bit stale. What got me the most was that you'll have to pay for the pack to unlock all the different characters instead of earning in-game money to purchase whichever hero you desired.

This would work better as a dungeon crawler. With online connectivity to enjoy with local friends or people around the world. | 本体免费，英雄也很便宜，游戏体验良好。

Looking forward to the new game soon! | I am coming back to give this game a review after sinking thousands of hours over into both Civ 4 and Civ 5 and on the launch day of Civ 7. Having played Civ 7 for a few hours now, I can say that that those of us who truly loved and still love Civ 5 judged Civ 6 too harshly when it released. It changed some things that people liked, but I still found many of its new features truly enjoyable on launch. I had fun. I still preferred 5, but in 6 the art, the music, the innovations to unrest, espionage, religion, and--to a lesser extent--city development were all excellent. Heroes are cool. The roster is cool. Civ 7 has little that is as redeeming in it at launch and I wholeheartedly recommend 6 instead. | Гра чудова, подобається різноманіття можливих стратегій розвитку цивілізацій. 

З негативного на мій погляд - викривлення певних історичних контекстів. Простежується культурна апропріація. 
Як наприклад Києво-Печерська Лавра - серце України в реальності,  є особливою спорудою російської імперії у грі... Як зокрема і унікальний юніт - козаки, що у реальності початково виникли як соціальний клас саме у степах України.
 Дуже нериємно це бачити, особливо в умовах, коли росія щодня знищує наші міста в реальності...

 | 非常杀时间的游戏，经常一开始玩就忘记时间了，看着文明不停地发展，心里也会有种成就感，只是这个画风有点卡通了，要是能够写实点就好了😁😁😁 | Нові стратегічні рішення та чудова графіка.
Але важко уявити, що в 2025 році ми все ще змушені бачити у світі ігор проросійські наративи. У новій версії гри розробники ""відзначилися"" черговим ігноруванням української локалізації та повного ігнорування української нації, яка переживає героїчну боротьбу за своє існування та незалежність.  

Анонс нового персонажа, цариці-душогубки, яка нав'язується як ""символ культури та просвітництва"", виглядає як зневага до мільйонів українців. Героізація імперіалістичної постаті — це не тільки обурливо, але й аморально в контексті війни та окупації, яку сьогодні переживає наша країна.  

Українці заслуговують на повагу в індустрії відеоігор, а не на спроби просувати імперський наратив під виглядом ""культурних цінностей"". Досить толерувати пропаганду! Вимагаємо повноцінної української локалізації, українських героїв і персонажів, які реально відображають нашу історію, культуру та боротьбу.

It's hard to believe that in 2025 we are still witnessing pro-Russian narratives in the gaming industry. In the latest version of the game, the developers once again ignored Ukrainian localization and completely erased the Ukrainian nation, which is heroically fighting for its survival and independence.  

The announcement of a new character, a tsarina-murderer being portrayed as a ""symbol of culture and enlightenment,"" is a slap in the face to millions of Ukrainians. Glorifying an imperialist figure is not only outrageous but also immoral in the context of the war and occupation Ukraine is enduring today.  

Ukrainians deserve respect in the gaming industry, not an attempt to promote imperial narratives disguised as ""cultural values."" Enough with the propaganda! We demand full Ukrainian localization, Ukrainian heroes, and characters that truly reflect our history, culture, and struggle."

Плюс это порт мобильный донатной игры. | Faeria is fun. Okay, I can see myself spending 10 more hours on fighting AI on Pandora Mode. I already spent 28 hours. The rest of the game depends if I can push myself over the skill cliff of deckbuilding, because it's really hard. I can recommend this game very easily. I get to max out the utility of every monster, every decision, and win a lot.

But let's go into the reasons why this game isn't successful. NOTE: I go against AI and don't really compete.
- Faeria looks like a typo to a lot of search engines. It's very close to Fairy.
- You don't get to walk around. Like every other trading card game, you battle and these battles can get lengthy. There's no rest stop besides staring at the card collection.
- The campaign mode is fighting random NPCs with one-liners and that's it. There's no story, no satisfying closures besides winning, no secrets to unlock beyond the loot boxes of cards. The boss battles do have that unfair advantage, but there's no extra flair to them so they still look like normal NPCs to fight. While you are building a card collection, most people won't feel the dopamine of progress.
- In a fair match, the tension is not there for a lot of mid games. You either steamroll or get steamrolled. This might be because I play very defensively and haven't touched the aggressive cards. This might also be b/c I don't play competitively. I like steamrolling, but variety is the spice of life.
- Most of us will never ever beat this game, because the hard challenges are really hard. Many games can split the difficulty into Easy Mode, Normal Mode, and Hard Mode. This game doesn't split those modes, it blends them all together (easy stuff first ofc) and you know, not everyone wants to play Hard Mode. Like I said, my next 10 hours are probably going to be Pandora Mode and ignore the rest of it.
- I've fallen into playing very defensively. Like I ALWAYS go for the faeria well on the first turn. This might be a me problem, but I feel like it's the strongest strat.

What is Pandora Mode? You build a random deck 1 card at a time and play 6 random NPCs in a FAIR match. And there's rewards for it.

But again, I like the game. But again, I like utilizing every card to the most of its ability, being very goal-orientated when I place new land, and then steamrolling my AI opponents."

76561197976281073,531540,Hidden Dimensions 3,52.333333333333336,Strategy,1,"One of the best battle card games available.  I like the diffenet races having different abilities, stratagies and play styles yet it is very well balanced. | While running through the free card games on steam, I stumbled across Hidden Dimensions 3. Since it was a SciFi themed game, it immediately skipped to the top of my playlist.

Then I was stuck in an absolutely tiny window reading an excessive amount of text in the tutorial because I couldn’t adjust the resolution once the tutorial began. I admit, that soured me on the game. 

As for the tutorial itself, it was thorough and explained things fairly well, BUT it didn’t feel like I learned how to truly play since I was simply told the rules and told what to play when. The tutorial is both very good and not a proper introduction to playing.

Giving the game another chance does reveal a lot of good things about it. The ships are good. There is excellent variety and quality art. The game design and game play is reasonable and well thought out. Unfortunately the game feels too slow over all.

76561197976281073,531640,Eternal Card Game,8.7,"Casual, Massively Multiplayer, Strategy, Free To Play",1,"I've played Magic on and off my whole life and spent at least 1000 hours playing Hearthstone. I had MTGO since the very beginning, and Hearthstone since late 2013 near the end of the open beta. Eternal is the best online card game I've ever played. It combines the best aspects of Magic's strategic depth and Hearthstone's fast-paced accessibility while avoiding their flaws.
F2P
Magic will always be expensive because it's a tradable CCG with a reserve list of cards that can't be reprinted and expensive booster packs. Most cards lose tons of value when they rotate out of standard. MTGO is less expensive and more liquid than physical cards, but still expensive. Recently, Wizards have added features similar to other digital CCGs like treasure chests.
Hearthstone is ""F2P"" in name only. New players need to spend lots of money or time to earn a viable deck. Otherwise, enjoy scraping out wins with a crappy pile at rank 17. Rewards for winning games are meager. You can get big payoffs in Arena (where you don't get to keep the cards you draft)...if you're already an experienced player and/or lucky. Arena costs 1.5 packs to play with cards you don't own and win at least 1 pack of value. You don't keep the cards. New Arena players get trashed.
Eternal is truly F2P. The spoils of victory are frequent and generous. Each win either gives a treasure chest with gold and a card, or more gold and a better card, or even more gold holy shit and a booster pack. Each treasure chest has a chance of becoming a better treasure chest full of even better rewards. Single-player Gauntlet mode lets you face the AI for free to win big rewards. Forge and Draft are more expensive than HS Arena (2.5 and 5x pack price vs. 1.5x pack price), but you get to keep all the cards you draft in Forge and Draft modes while still winning big payoffs for playing well.
Magic is pay to play, try to recoup your losses later. Hearthstone is an evil slot machine that reluctantly hands out the goods. Eternal is a slot machine that always gives you something, but sometimes gives you something better, and occasionally gives you an all-expenses-paid trip to Hawaii.
Winner: Eternal
Gameplay and RNG
Magic is the deepest, most complicated, most strategically interesting CCG ever. Almost every type of card, zone and resource can be interacted with, during both players' turns. The mana system rewards intelligent deck building and decision making skills. However, the mana system has also been a constant thorn in its side. Mana screw and flood as well as color screw are a necessary evil of the game's design, and consistently ruin the experience and decide high-level matches. The mulligan system punishes you further for the crime of being unlucky. Magic Online makes no use of any digital-only design space (except Momir Basic) and the relief from shuffling physical cards. The metagame gets patched several times a year whenever the physical Banned and Restricted list is updated.
Hearthstone sidesteps resource problems with its mana system, but has different issues instead. It's a simplistic ""My turn, your turn"" game with a hard limit to how interesting and interactive it can be. The mana system means that instead of getting mana-screwed, you get tempo-screwed if you don't draw a 2 on turn 2, a 3 on turn 3, and so on. It's called Curvestone for a reason. Being able to attack anything directly means that losing the board first usually means losing the game. The mulligan system is good. Hearthstone explores digital design space, but leans overwhelmingly on random effects. The RNG is so hilariously pervasive that even top-level players meme about it on a constant basis. Omnipresent powerful random effects make situations that are impossible to play around. It's one thing to get outplayed, but it feels awful to get outlucked. HS is the game of getting outlucked. Also, the meta is prone to getting extremely stale as Team 5 moves very slowly to nerf problem cards and very rarely buffs weaker ones.
Eternal simplifies the essence of Magic's strategic, interactive gameplay. You can still interact on your opponents' turns and there's plenty of powerful spot and mass removal (at common and uncommon, even!) to deal with tall and wide boards. The mana and combat systems are similar to Magic's. Eternal mitigates bad opening hands by allowing you to redraw a 7 card hand with between 2-5 mana cards, guaranteed. Flood and screw are still possible, but not nearly as frequently as in Magic. The combat system is much more interesting less blatantly aggressive than Hearthstone's, with different advantages given for attackers and defenders. Eternal makes excellent use of digital design space. You can affect cards in any zone, some cards make copies of themselves when drawn, and card attributes will persist across different zones, resulting in creative combos. As far as the metagame, in the last few months Dire Wolf Digital has shown a willingness to alter cards and tune up the meta in a timely manner when certain strategies are revealed to be too oppressive or lacking in counterplay.
Winner: Magic for overall depth, Eternal for elegance and creativity with digital space.
Polish and Features
Magic Online is the laughingstock of the digital games world. However, it has many more features than HS, with a huge variety of formats available, a full-featured collection and deck manager, and the ability to trade tickets cards with bots other players.
Hearthstone is a beautiful experience with compelling graphics, music, animations and voice acting. However, it possesses a few game modes (casual, ranked, arena, tavern brawl) with only two formats for now (wild and tavern brawl). It possesses extremely few features despite its obscene profitability and years post-release. There is no tournament mode and the deck and collection managers are very weak.
Eternal's art direction, sound design and graphical effects are better than Magic Online (like every other game) and worse than Hearthstone's (like every other game), but far closer to Hearthstone than to Magic Online. It only has two single player and two multiplayer modes. It has an intuitive, full-featured collection manager and deckbuilder with analytic tools to help guide deckbuilding.
Winner: Hearthstone for polish, Eternal for features.
Verdict
On the whole, Eternal refines and simplifies Magic's gameplay and creatively explores new design space while avoiding the egregious errors of Hearthstone. The gameplay finely balances a majority focus on skill with a pinch of luck. There is a wealth of interactions and strategies to explore. The online experience is elegant, enjoyable and full-featured. The game is generous with its rewards. You should stop reading this and install it right now. Why are you still reading this? Go away. Go play Eternal | Quick Review: Great Magic: The Gathering inspired digital CCG. Amazing UI, loads of features, brilliant draft system, and some truly awesome cards. But... as an MTG derivative, you have to be able to accept mana flooding/screwing.

Long Review:

I wanted to put some good hours into the game before reviewing (18 as of this post). I've completed the Tutorial Quests, four Forges, one draft and a ton of ranked games. Oh, and I've been playing Magic since Arabian Nights and Hearthstone since Beta.

To start, this is NOT Hearthstone. It is Magic the Gathering. Everything you know from Hearthstone doesn't apply here. You have to play ""power"" cards (mana/lands), so you need to know how to balance a deck. The system will try to do it for you and they start you out with a full set of 40 ""dual stones"", but to be good at the game you'll need to understand how to get the proper ratios. You also don't choose how you attack. You choose WHO attacks, and the opponent chooses blocks.

Once you accept that this is Magic on digitial steroids, you can really enjoy the game. Note: the initial tutorial quests are drudgery. Your decks suck and the mana ratios aren't great. They should really let you skip parts of this, but they don't. JUST PLAY THROUGH. It's worth it. You'll get a free Forge, which will net you a solid amount of packs and get you going.

The UI is AMAZING. You can get through games in 5 minutes and there is almost no waiting. Everything just works like you expect it to. WotC should hang its head in shame after seeing this.

There are a ton of cards for a first launch and lots of interesting deck ideas to build around. You could say that there are some balance issues - Black has a ridiculous suite of creature removal for a core set - but overall it does feel like every color have something truly special that it can do, and there are solid Aggro, Control and Combo strategies.

While I still love Hearthstone, I've been finding myself coming back to Eternal again and again, excited to play more. It's awesome and will be enjoyed by anyone who has played and enjoyed Magic at any time in their life. | Surement l'un des meilleurs, si ce n'est le meilleur jeu de cartes actuellement disponible sur le marché.

Il combine à lui seul tous les avantages qui sont présents sur ses concurrents directs. 

Ici il a très peu de places au RNG (comprenez à la chance), bien sûr il y en aura toujours sur ce type de jeu puisque cela reste un tirage sur plusieurs dizaines de cartes et si une carte tombe au bon moment dans une partie qui semble perdue cela peu la renversée.

Aspect également important, c'est que c'est un vrai free to play. On peut vite obtenir des cartes du seul Set disponible à l'heure actuelle. Tu farmes, tu suis les quêtes journalières, tu seras récompensé. Pour ceux qui détestent l'aspect versus contre d'autres joueurs, il existe des modes exclusifs contre l'IA (vous contre l'ordi en somme). C'est très intéressant pour des joueurs débutants qui veulent prendre leur temps sur chacun de leurs tours. Ici pas de chronomètre si vous mettez trop de temps a joué pour vous mettre la pression !

Seul point qui peut rebuter les joueurs non anglophones, le jeu n'est pas traduit en français a l'heure actuelle, mais rien de dramatique en cherchant un peu avec google tu vas pouvoir t'en sortir petit geek ! | + A interface é muito boa e intuitiva (cópia descarada do hearthstone);
- Uns diriam que o jogo é pay-to-win, mas quando na verdade é um pay-to-play como acontece em TODO cardgame da categoria, você não ganha por pagar mais, você paga para ter as cartas e ganha se souber jogar;
+ O jogo possibilita grindar as cartas muito facilmente, você ganha gold rápido além de ganhar cartas a cada vitória;
+ Os boosters vem com 12 cartas sendo uma delas rara/lendária, sendo assim você consegue fechar um playset de cartas de raridade mais baixa muito rápido, tendo que se preocupar apenas com as 'caras';
+ Existem MUITAS mecânicas e interações baseadas em magic, tornando o jogo muito mais competitivo e menos randômico (bom pra quem odeia o RNG do hearthstone);
+ Existem cartas chamadas 'fast spells' que são o equivalente das 'mágicas instantâneas' do magic, estas cartas possibilitam jogadas de resposta durante o turno do oponente;
+ Durante o combate, os jogadores escolhem apenas se atacam e com quais criaturas eles atacam, o jogador defensor escolhe se bloqueia e com quais criaturas ele bloqueia (semelhante ao mágic, diferente do hearthstone), ao meu ver isso possibilita a presença de mais criaturas de utilidade no deck (que possuem algum tipo de efeito que não seja apenas voltado ao combate) e meio que exige cartas de resposta do oponente para tais criaturas (removals), além disso as criaturas 'regeneram' o dano no final de cada turno, assim como acontece no magic;
+ O tutorial inicial do jogo é muito bom (não é nem um pouco chato) e te mostra boa parte das mecânicas além de te presentear com boas cartas, no final do tutorial você já ganha um deck de uma facção (cada deck já vem com uma lendária e o deck da facção das sombras tem uma lendária muito boa);

Só jogando pra ver mesmo, tanto para os jogadores de magic, quanto para os jogadores de hearthstone fica a dica deste jogo ;) | Jedna z większych niespodzianek wśród rosnącego ostatnio bardzo rynku karcianek. Spodziewałem się kolejnej karcianki a'la Hearthstone a tu taka niespodzianka! Dla mnie HS odpychał zbyt bardzo casualem, tutaj mamy już głebie zaczerpniętą z MtG. Tak dobrze słyszycie ta gra to wyśmienite połączenie Hearthstone z królem karcianek jakim jest Magic the Gathering. Oprócz standardowych trybów znanych z konkurencyjnych tytułów błyszczy szczególnie dobrze zanany fanom MTG tryb Draft. Najlepsze w tym trybie jak i trybie Forge(odpowiednik HS'owego ""drafta"") jest to, że karty które wybieramy dostajemy na zawsze!!! Inne plusy to duża ilość kart, możliwość tworzenia decków o dużej synergii na wzór też tych znanych nam z MTG, nie mamy wrażenia składania po prostu mocnych kart w jedną talie jak w HS. Gra mimo fazy wczesnego dostępu ma bardzo dużo contentu i jest ciągle rozwijana. Dodatkowo duża liczba graczy jaki, prężnie rozwijające się community tej gry powoduje, że wieszcze jej świetlaną przyszłość. Dajcie tej grze szanse a nie pożałujecie !!!"

Caso queiram dar uma olhada no jogo, segue a análise comentada !

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFimFhLkhtU | En este tercer Edit de mi análisis solo decir que: Después de más de un año sin jugar lo instalé de nuevo para darle otra oportunidad. He de decir que esperaba una gran mejora, como no ha tenido ese avance lo dejo definitivamente fuera de mi biblioteca.

Cosas positivas: 
+ La idea está muy bien.
+ No hace falta dedicarle mucho tiempo 
+ El diseño de la interfaz me gusta, hace sencillo de entender al juego. 
+ Tienes que pensar bien que cartas usar para mejorar a tus soldaditos. (Aunque la estrategia no va mucho más allá) 
+ Cada isla tiene unos 6 niveles de dificultad, así que la cosa no siempre es tan simple.

Cosas negativas: 
- Una vez llegas a la quinta isla empieza a ser aburrido 
- Los balances del dinero están mal equilibrados 
- Hay islas mas avanzadas que son más fáciles que anteriores, por ejemplo, la 7 es más fácil que la 6. 
- No está en más idiomas sino en inglés (Aunque tampoco hay que saber demasiado para entender el juego) 
- (Este punto es más bien un consejo) Deberían implantar algún tipo de clasificación mundial o regional, para darle algo de competitividad. 

Me dejo muchas cosas, como que tal es la música y demás. También hay que tener en cuenta que el juego no ha sido terminado y que es gratuito. | Beginner Tips
1. Rush gold farm, better to build adventure quest at early. map 3 and 4 is good place
2. Rush bosses = start farming as many chest as early, the 4,8 and 12 hr wait time is killing
3. Rush new map = more Guildian / farm
4. Level the quest which you have bonus is better if you have x10 or more
5. I reset the monster,xp quest at map 6, 7 to lv1 after unlocking the boss, other quest all adventure, easy farm and guildian die less
6. Map 5 quest 16 - 24 for xp quest farm
Spoiler http://steamcommunity.com/id/imfearless/screenshot/156899501290589681
7. Sometime it is better to have lower lv quest or cut half the road 
Spoiler http://steamcommunity.com/id/imfearless/screenshot/156899501290545579
8. The debate of leaving the game on and afk for boss chest or go offline for more gold / xp
9. If you like this game, then its good to get the beginner bundle and unlock thief class, you have  time till map 3,4 to test if you like the game ( also where it become more difficult)
10. Boss chest give xp, gold, card, guildian and GEMS! (Cash shop currency at a low rate but the most important !)

. | This game's audio is really broken right now, the characters all sound like they are about half a mile down a tunnel or well, and it's even worse for the character you play as, you can;t hear them at all, just see the subtitles. I have looked everywhere, even dev blogs for a fix to this and there is no fixes found. It is definitely the game itself that has this game breaking bug as all other 250+ games I have on Steam do not have these kind of audio issues. I say game breaking bug, because, for me at least, half the fun of this game is the dialogue between all the characters. Fat Shark you need to fix this issue! I cannot and will not recommend this game right now as audio bugs can really affect how the gameplay runs, do yourself a favor and wait til you see a post saying they have fixed this issue. | I'd really love to upvote this game as it has been great co-operative multiplayer experience whenever it has worked properly. That is, the title bringing a breath of life into the Left 4 Dead genre with extensive character customization abilities. However, the game is let down by its horrible network code. More than half of the random games I've joined have ended up in some sort of desyncronization problems or outright disconnect without any specific reason or warning. Neither does any sort of game recovery from a disconnected host work either. Seven years after the release date the network play of the title is way too unreliable to really allow recommending the title.

My advice: if you are interested, buy the base game without any DLC if it's heavily discounted. If you enjoy it and find the network performance acceptable for your needs, so be it. In my case with the random games being irritating disconnect-a-fest I'm certainly not investing into all DLC's of the game even if they gave me considerable amount of new content to play with."
76561197976281073,507490,Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation,0.13333333333333333,"Simulation, Strategy",0,"Ashes of the Singularity carries a familiar essence, particularly for fans of Supreme Commander. The influence is undeniable, and I could feel its spirit seeping through the gameplay. The campaign offers a solid, well-structured experience, while the multiplayer delivers the standard fare you’d expect from an RTS. That, in essence, is the theme of this game—it doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it delivers a polished and well-executed version of familiar mechanics.

My biggest gripe is the unit design. Many units look too similar, which can make it difficult to differentiate them at a glance. Additionally, the two main factions, while distinct in playstyle, share a somewhat uniform aesthetic, which makes them feel less visually unique than they could be.

On the positive side, the game excels in its command and control mechanics. The speed at which you can build, group, and maneuver your forces is impressive. The V key will quickly become your best friend, as it allows you to form cohesive armies that support one another effectively. However, the attack-move function can be a bit frustrating—frontline units will engage while those in the rear sometimes idle instead of pushing forward. The best workaround is to avoid attack-move and instead overshoot your target, ensuring your forces spread out and engage as intended.

If you find Ashes of the Singularity on sale and have a soft spot for Supreme Commander, it’s absolutely worth picking up. I’ve had a great time with it, and despite some minor flaws, it delivers an enjoyable large-scale RTS experience. | I wish more games would take this approach its simple but not halo wars simple(love that game too btw). | Once you get the hang of it, it is fun.

- Die Kampagne ist lahm
- Die gesamte Aufmachen, Videosequenzen, Story, Ingamegrafik, alles wirkt billig
- Die Einheiten sind nutzlos, alles unausgereift. Kaum Taktikmöglichkeiten, im Grunde geht's nur darum einen Haufen von allem zu machen, alles zusammenzuwürfeln und auf den Gegner zu werfen

Pourtant j'ai en le téléchargeant pensé à me retrouver sur un énième jeu Coréen ou le bashing était plus important que le reste, et en faite même si il existe des secteurs de cartes ou il est vrai le nombre de monstres au m² est beaucoup plus élevé et que l'on a intérêt à avoir des skills de zone ou multi, il est tout à fait plaisant de voir ces monstres exploser de joie à votre passage (pour eux ce n'est peut être pas réellement de joie, mais franchement c'est l'éclate !)

Ici ce n'est pas Révélation Online, pas de marche automatique pour les feignants, ici on vous renseigne juste dans quelle zone il faut aller... Les quêtes sont comme partout de la plus simple ""va chercher"" à la liste des actions à mener. Le craft est aussi présent et donne des bonus de vitesse et de vie pour ceux qui veulent y passer du temps et à l'air relativement complet. J'ai entraperçu un système de création d'armes en ramassant des cristaux, c'est visiblement tres simple d'avoir une bonne arme au début car ces cristaux sont simple à looter, mais forcement plus vous montez de niveaux, plus il faut de cristaux et plus ils sont durs à trouver.

[h1]Que du bon ?[/h1]
Le truc déroutant (et oui faut bien en parler) c'est la minimap en plein milieu qui au début est assez chiante, dans les options il y a un reglage d'interface, et dans cette dernière on peut configurer la taille de chaque process... dont la taille de la minimap. Personnellement réglée à 50% elle retrouve sa place à côté du radar comme un WoW à l'ancienne. 
Néanmoins, le problème de ce jeu est pour moi la monotonie, plus on joue plus on s'apercoit que l'on fait toujours la même chose, pas de découvertes, pas de suspense, juste des sacs à Pv dont les skins changent avec toujours les mêmes quêtes, il faudra surement un moral d'acier pour continuer le jeu à vraiment haut niveau... Et à force on comprend, pourquoi ils font ces nombreuses promotions en offrant des cadeaux.

[h1]Informations importantes: [/h1]
- Vous n'avez le droit qu'à deux Perso par compte en ""gratuit"" ... des DLC existent pour augmenter le nombre de slot. A mon niveau je ne sais pas si le jeu en offre à certains niveaux atteints.
- La maintenance se fait le MARDI de 09h00 à  11, 12 voir 13 heures selon les semaines.
- Pour savoir les buffs que l'on a actuellement, c'est la petite icône ""roue dentée"" tout seule sur la droite... décocher les trois premiers éléments de la fenetre apparue et vous verrez les buffs/débuffs que vous avez (les trois autres sont pour le groupe.) | With unique combat system, that, with very low targetting, it's rather tempting. It's not like WoW or RIFT - where you have to click or tab on a player and cast spells, or skills, or whatever spells/skills are called in each game. Instead, you're just spamming your skills as you quest or kill some players.

The graphics are awesome too. Which even doubles the ""want to play""

One small downside, is the FPS drops. You won't notice it while you're questing, but while doing some max-level stuff, you'll notice the FPS drops quite alot.

Atlas Reactor has Mod system and catalysts to make the game more versatile and lets people create their own strategy, and there are 4 basic ability and one ultimate ability, each character has their own energy meter.

In this game however, there are only 2 basic ability, 1 passive ability and 1 ultimate ability, you control all 4 characters (which makes it confusing as hell to newcomers), and they share the same energy meter, meaning if you use your ulti with a character, you cant use ulti with another character.

Atlas Reactor has phases to determine which skills will go off first, action order doesnt do anything, you have dash phase if you wanna dodge attacks so you have to be smart while using them, and walking phase is the last phase.

In Insidia, you dont have phases but instead each character has their own ""initiative"" (think of it as Pokemon's speed stat), and since characters move first then use their abilities, it doesnt feel fair that they could dodge an attack.

However, the game suffers from the passage of time in several key areas. The interface is clunky and lacks adequate scaling options, making it feel dated. Additionally, the mechanics and overall gameplay can feel archaic, and the writing often comes across as amateurish, detracting from the experience.

Graphically, while the visuals are decent, the heavy reuse of assets creates a repetitive feel throughout the game. In isolation, Eschalon might seem acceptable, but when compared to its peers or later titles it inspired, like Balrum or Exiled Kingdoms (which I strongly recommend), it becomes clear that it falls short.

There are certainly commendable ideas present, such as the cartography system and the ability to hide in the dark, which add depth to the gameplay. However, the main plot remains elusive, and the sparse number of NPCs makes the world feel empty and less engaging. Walking across the map can feel long and tiresome, leading to a sense of fatigue rather than adventure.

Ultimately, while Eschalon: Book I has its moments, I find it difficult to recommend it to contemporary players looking for a rich and immersive experience. There are simply too many areas where the game doesn’t hold up against more modern offerings, or older games like Fallout 1 & 2, Wizardry, Ultima etc... | From my child hood time playing this, to the music, and multiple dynamic ways to play this in not strict way.

You can get these in game, which is at least a plus, but it feels like an advertisement, the way they are drip fed to you.
And when I say worth, there's a pack in the game, that comes with an autoclicking raccoon (Trash Panda) and some potions, it says it's 35 quids worth at the cost of 15 quid.
That is not 35 quids worth. Some potions and an admittedly very cute, Raccoon are not worth 35 quid... If you think that, then you're just incorrect. Factually false.

If you're content to leave the game on in the background, that's not a problem. You'll eventually get things that will be left in the background. There's also codes you can enter for free chests, which is nice. A point in the games favour.

But I cannot recommend this game, on the basis that it is so greedy. So many micro-transactions. You can potentially spend hundreds of pounds on a game that you leave on in the background. 

If you are not the kind to fall prey to microtransactions, then yes, by all means, get this game, leave it on in the background, and enjoy. But if you are... then avoid it at all costs! Because this game will ride you hard and take you for everything you've got. | Un univers qu'on apprécie

ВОУ ВОУ ВОУ, ЭЙ, ТЫ, СТОЯТЬ! 
Ты вообще понимаешь, в какую историю ты влезаешь? Нет? Тогда слушай.

Dreamfall Chapters - это конец путешествия.
Хотелось бы сказать, что эту игру можно пройти без предыдущих частей, но это не так.

The Longest Journey (1999г)- 1 часть истории. Начало. Эта история Эйприл Райн. История, которая рассказывает больше о мире магии - Аркадии, чем о мире-близнеце науке - Старке.

Dreamfall: The Longest Journey (2006г)- 2 часть истории. Середина. Эта же история Зои Кастильо. История, которая уже рассказывает больше о мире науке - Старке.

Dreamfall Chapters - 3 часть истории. Конец огромного и сложного путешествия, который связывает первые две части и отвечает на все поставленные там вопросы.
Не, ты конечно же можешь сразу начать это проходить, но, скорее всего, толком ничего не поймёшь. Даже если полезешь искать описание предыдущих частей, то могу лишь пожелать удачи. Материала там на часа 2 объяснения о мирах, снах, балансе и пр. и как это всё связано между собой.

А теперь о моём впечатлении. О минусах и плюсах.

Общее:
- Эпизоды. Первая часть игры была полноценным квестом с заданиями по типу ""найди что-то непонятно что и помести это непонятно куда"". Вторая же часть была больше линейной и там практически не было загадок. А вот 3 часть решила совместить в себе линейный сюжет и непонятные квесты. Добавим некое полуоткрытое пространство в первых эпизодах + выбор действий с последующим влиянием на сюжет.
- Выбор действий. Меня порадовало то, что выбор здесь действительно влияет на сюжет, хотя концовка будет всего одна.
- Изменение мира. Это и не плюс, и не минус. В первых главах мир хоть как-то меняется, но мне не хватило изменений в главах ""Интерлюдии"".
- Смена направления. Первые эпизоды - это больше про побегушки по большой локации с целью ""сделай хоть шо-нибудь"", но уже с 4го эпизода появляется линейность в локации и динамика в сюжете. Вот прям 4ый и 5ый эпизод скушались с аппетитом.

Плюсы:
- Симпатичные модельки персонажей.
- Дизайн локаций тоже очень даже симпатичный. Особенно меня радует узнаваемость этих локаций. Всю историю делали на протяжении ~17лет с 1999г по 2016г. В ""Dreamfall Chapters"" присутствует очень много локаций с 1ой части ""The Longest Journey"". Да, улучшено качество и текстуры, ибо прогресс технологий не стоял на месте, но при этом разработчик сохранил визуальную каноничность локаций.
- Красивый ""магический"" саунд на фоне.
- Ворон. Как же я была рада встретить уже такого близкого, родного и верного спутника Ворона, который нас сопровождает аж с 1ой части.
- Шутки. Пускай здесь их и не сильно много, но моментами от них прорывает даже не на ""хи-хи"", а прямо на ""ха-ха"". 
- Ведьмы. Отдельно отмечу, что мне понравилась тема с ведьмами и понравилась сама их локация. Игра напомнила о 1ой части... О первой встрече с Ведьмой... Боже, нет такого хоррора, который меня бы напугал больше, чем та Ведьма из 1999года... Ужос....

Минусы:
- Главный и жирный минус - это анимация. Модельки то красивые, но на анимацию денег не хватило. Игра прям очень сильно заторможенная. Должна быть динамика, но всю игру ощущается какая-то статика. Игра 2016 года по анимации сравнима с какой-нибудь халфой 1998 года. Да мне кажется, что в халфе и то динамики больше будет, чем в этой игре.
- Зоя тут у нас решила в истерички податься. Вынести своему мужику мозг из-за супа, а потом ходить и думать, что у вас всё плохо? Ну нравится ему сырный суп, гспдя, пускай кушает то, что он хочет. При этом сам Реза ведёт себя спокойно и адекватно. Никаких намёков на какие-то проблемы в отношениях, пока Зои придумывает драму. Хьюстон, у нас проблема! У Зои мозг с алика сломался, нужен новый! 
- Опять Зои. На отца мы оч сильно обиделись, что тот пытался огородить Зои от опасности, зато простили Резу, который втянул Зои в опасную историю и просто исчез во 2ой части игры. Класс. Че там, новый мозг ещё не приехал?
- Анна. Дружбу разработчики очень хорошо прописывают, но они вообще не умеют в романтику. Как и во 2ой части, тут я славила долю кринжа. Прикинь, ты впервые познакомился с человеком и он сразу лезет к тебе сосаться. Ну ведь кринге! Из-за этого меня моментально оттолкнуло от Анны. Гадкий персонаж.
- Ханна. Пускай на момент выхода игры тема ""плевать куда, но надо впихать лгбт перса"" только начала развиваться, но я всё равно скажу, что оно меня раздражает. Мне плевать кто и с кем, но эти персы всегда максимально неуместно впихиваются в сюжет, да ещё и выглядят как ""спиралька"" единорога. Разработчик прописывает бездомного персонажа, что делит ""кровать"" с блохами в канализации. Кого мы представляем? Правильно! Хорошо одетую, чистую, радужную на цвета, обвешанную безделушками девчульку, которая стрижётся у мастера Газонокосильщика. Не в звезду, зато лгбт.
- Ворота в канализашке. Серьёзно? Зачем там ворота, которые можно сбоку обойти за 2 секунды? Это как одна дверь в чистом поле. Столько же логики. А ведь так просто было закрыть весь туннель цельной решёткой, чтобы ворота нельзя было обойти... И всё, вопросов к тупости данной локации у меня бы и не было.
- Стелс. Он как бы здесь прописан по сюжету, но его как бы и нет. Тут и с врагами можно обтираться, и в пустом помещении с эхо и кучей врагов можно громко разговаривать, шуметь и бегать. Игра типо для более взрослых людей, но стелс на уровне детской игры.
- Игра просто вырезала сцену получения целого ездового животного - элгвана. Мелочь, но выглядит, как небольшая пропасть на пути сюжета.
- Хлипкая локация. Деревня в зоне Пурпурных гор кажется максимально странной, а точнее у меня вызывают вопросы мосты сделанные из палок с огромными дырами и всё это расположено над пропастью, где не видно дна. Такие мосты и ветер снесёт без проблем...
- Очень жаль, что по банальной мелочи, которую можно было и не показывать, сразу спойлериться финальный босс. Вот прям убрать эту мелочь и финал бы вызвал большую непредсказуемость.

Пускай и были какие-то технические и сюжетные косяки, но под конец игра вывела меня на эмоции и грусть, а это уже отличный показатель качества игры. 
История полностью завершена. 3я часть воссоединилась с 1ой, что породило ""бесконечное путешествие"". 

Отдельно скажу Спасибо студии локализации ""Cool-Games"" за русификацию звука.

p.s. Игра почтиии ответила на все вопросы... Третья часть и в третий раз спрошу: та кааак же Эйпрел заточила местного Сарумана в калькулятор???! Но на этот вопрос мне уже точно никогда не ответят :( | Great story, great characters and resolution help make up for somewhat lackluster gameplay. I only wish they could have fleshed out more of the world, allowed us to travel to even more exotic locations... | Игра однозначно стоит вашего внимания. Это инди проект, разрабатывающий много лет.
Игра интересна своим уникальным сюжетом и повествованием. Основа игры это диалоги, головоломки и кат-сцены.
Все персонажи прописаны очень хорошо, а за диалогами очень интересно наблюдать и слушать. История очень затягивает и увлекает с первых минут, хотя если вы не знаете сюжет прошлой части могут возникнуть трудности, но Fandom вам в помощь (как и мне). 
Во время прохождения игры вы испытаете огромный спектр эмоций от интриг и закрученного сюжета, от хорошо прописанных персонажей и коммуникации с ними.
Огромным плюсом этой игры была возможность играть в неё на macOS. Спасибо разработчикам что подарили такую возможность. Надеюсь на новую игру из этой серии в дальнейшем, теперь я ее фанат. | One of the oldest sagas i've played. It's a dream worth living. | I am a huge fan of the first two titles, and they will forever remain among my absolute favorite games. But this was a disappointment.

I followed the development process and the books as they were released but gave up after the fourth one due to that disappointment. Now, years later, I have decided to give it another ago and finally find out how it all ends.

And what do you know, now it's even more of a disappointment.

[u]Spoilers ahead. [/u]

I definitely enjoyed [i]some[/i] parts of the game. I loved seeing April. I loved the visuals. I loved walking around Marcuria and Europolis.

But the writing… is subpar, to put it mildly. And somehow, it gets worse and worse with each book. By the end of the game, it was pretty clear that the devs did not know how to finish the storylines and tie the plot together, so they just created Saga to shove her in the right place and resolve everything. And on top of that, made Kian adopt her (which was beyond stupid and cringe-inducing) because they had no idea what to do with Lady Alvane and they [i]definitely[/i] didn't want it to be April as fans speculated for years because Kian's now apparently gay.

I hated the modern-day politics shoved into 22th century and a fantasy world. I hated that lazy ""hey do you know fascism is bad"" writing, including the ginger Hitler-like, a replica of concentration camps, and racial hate speeches - what on earth was all that. Who do they think the audience of TLJ has been? Teenagers?

I also hated the multiverse angle, and I [i]really[/i] hated the retconning of previous games. I hated how they changed Kian's character, because I loved him in Dremfall:TLJ and I loved his interactions with April. He had great potential as a character. But alas, in this game, I felt either nothing or annoyance.

If there ever will be TLJ:Home, I'm not expecting much from it. However, I will continue to enjoy the first two games with my own headcanons."

Unturned, Nelson Sexton tarafından geliştirilen ve 2014 yılında erken erişime açılan ücretsiz bir hayatta kalma oyunudur. Oyun, blok tarzı grafiklerle sunulan bir dünyada geçer ve oyuncuların hayatta kalmak için kaynak toplaması, barınak inşa etmesi ve zombilerle savaşması gerekmektedir.

Oynanış:
Unturned, oyunculara geniş bir dünya sunar. Kaynak toplama, yiyecek bulma ve silah yapma gibi temel hayatta kalma unsurlarıyla doludur. Zombilerle dolu bu dünyada, hayatta kalmak için stratejik düşünmek önemlidir. Ayrıca, oyuncular arasında işbirliği yapma veya rekabet etme seçeneği de vardır.

Kendi Yorumum:
Oynanış dinamikleri oldukça eğlenceli ve bağımlılık yapıcı. Özellikle arkadaşlarla birlikte oynandığında, keşif ve hayatta kalma unsurları çok daha keyifli hale geliyor. Ancak, bazen oyunun basit grafikleri ve mekanikleri bazı oyuncular için çekiciliğini azaltabilir.

Grafikler ve Ses:
Unturned, blok tarzı grafiklerle sunulmasına rağmen, bu tasarımın kendine özgü bir cazibesi var. Ses efektleri, oyunun atmosferini destekliyor, ancak bazen daha fazla çeşitlilik bekleyebilirsiniz.

Kendi Yorumum:
Grafikler basit olsa da, bu durum oyunun eğlencesini etkilemiyor. Hatta bazı oyuncular bu tarzı sevebilir. Ancak, daha gerçekçi bir deneyim arayanlar için hayal kırıklığı yaratabilir.

Topluluk ve Mod Desteği:
Unturned, aktif bir topluluğa ve geniş bir mod desteğine sahiptir. Oyuncular, çeşitli modlar ve sunucular aracılığıyla oyunu özelleştirebilir. Bu, oyunun ömrünü uzatır ve farklı deneyimler sunar.

Kendi Yorumum:
Topluluk, oldukça destekleyici ve yenilikçi. Modlar, oyunun eğlencesini artırıyor ve sürekli yeni içerikler sunuyor. Ancak, bazı sunuculardaki toksik davranışlar can sıkıcı olabilir.

Sonuç:
Unturned, hayatta kalma oyunları arasında kendine özgü bir yer edinmiştir. Basit ama eğlenceli yapısıyla, oyunculara hem zorlu hem de keyifli bir deneyim sunar. Eğer arkadaşlarınızla birlikte eğlenceli bir hayatta kalma oyunu arıyorsanız, Unturned kesinlikle denemeye değer. Kişisel olarak, bu oyunun sunduğu eğlence ve topluluk etkileşimleri, onu benim favori oyunlarımdan biri haline getiriyor. | ein bester server und spilt es holt euch das gold dlc | KA*AR ERAYIN BİLGİSAYARININ KALDIRDIĞI TEK OYUN | yes, and yes | 不好玩"
76561197976281073,323580,Jotun: Valhalla Edition,0.0,"Action, Adventure, Indie",0,"TLDR: This is a good exploration game, that features 6 major boss fights. It's not terribly long, and it's chill apart from having to deal with a some clunky features in the battle system.

I enjoy this game- it's relatively chill, up until you hit the different area bosses. You can complete each area in any order, so if you want to farm all the health and ability upgrades before doing the bosses, you can. The levels are neat, with some lore spread throughout. The music and voice over are really good, and I appreciate that they decided to record the dialogue in Icelandic. The art is interesting, and I appreciate that they tried to do something unique with it- it really shines with the bosses and creatures, and some of the environments are genuinely lovely. The boss fights are fun, and the the patterns are well telegraphed- I really enjoyed the Ice Jotun, and the Sky Jotun. That doesn't keep it from being frustrating though at times. 

Your character moves slow, the arena maps are large, and the giants have long steps (as they would be expected to have). You spend a lot of time chasing the giants around the arena, for a few hits, before they move again. The god abilities are frustrating to use, as they're on a bar that you cycle through. It's distracting to go from one ability to the next, and you have to watch what ability you have selected, which draws your attention away from the boss. It's easy to overshoot the ability you want, and you can't rearrange the skills to make it easier to get to the skills you need quickly. The selection does cycle from the end , back to the beginning, but that just once again means you sometimes roll past the thing you need. It would have felt more smooth to be able to assign the abilities to key/button presses in order to make better use of muscle memory, and it's hard not to feel like a fair number of deaths are because of this clunky feature. I would use all the abilities more often, if I didn't feel like I had to be on the most helpful skills, all the time, just in case.
I've gotten Odin down to 20% of his health a few times now, and am not sure I will complete the game due to this. I may just youtube the end of the game instead, but it was still enjoyable to try the game overall.

I will say for completionists, there is one persistent bug for the Northern Sky map which does not register you collecting the Mimir check point. This bug has been in the game since at least mid 2023, and hasn't been fixed. In order to get the achievement for completion, you need to change the game file to an older build through steam, and collect it using that version of the game.
Go to ""Properties -> Betas"" and in the ""Beta participation"" drop down menu select ""oldversion - oldversion""; the save files are apparently compatible. | This game is SO SLOW.I would walk, and it would be like 10 seconds to just get across one screen in a whole area. Want to do a heavy attack? Try waiting 3 full seconds for it to strike. Want to hit a boss? You'll walk up to it in 3 seconds, and then it'll slowly pull away, making it impossible to hit, and it'll take another 5 seconds to continue walking until you can hit it.
I found the abilities to be quite useless. I only used the healing, which by the end only recovers about 1/3 of your health (with 3 uses, you can roughly fill your health bar all the way back up once), and Mjolnir, which basically shaved off a few hits during boss battles (and since each attack sequence took anywhere between 10 and 30 seconds, it was a big time-saver). But because it only worked with heavy attacks, you had to basically be on top of it where you could trigger it AND get a heavy swing in before the boss moved again, which was very rare. I don't recall wasting so many limited-use abilities as I did in this game. And I tried triggering the other abilities, which mostly didn't really do anything useful. The shield, for example—if you needed it, you were probably dead, anyway.
For some reason, I wanted to be able to recommend this game because I'm a softie for pretty indie games with worlds that bring to life cultures and myths. But, man, it was almost like they didn't respect my time with this game. I wouldn't mind walking far distances if it was scenic or I felt like things were far away, but sometimes I'd walk for a minute or two only to be staring at my character moving slowly across a nearly blank screen the whole time. | Sevmedim ilk 30 dakikada bana devam ettirme isteği oluşturacak hiç bir şey vermedi.

I have played so many MMOs and they all seem like variations on the same thing. Stash is really unique and brings some cool new ideas. 

Turn based combat is what jumps right out. You have time to plan and think and I really like that. 

Your house (called your BOO or base of operations) is quite impressive. I can already see that this feature is incredibly deep and I will put a lot of time into making my BOO killer. 

A number of people have mentioned the community and I thought that was bs but then I got in game and they were right. The people in game are great and the devs are very open and honest and clearly care about this game a lot.

It is indeed early access so nothing is perfect but i can tell the rough edges will get dealt with and this is already a lot of fun. | quite frankly, it doesn't feel any different than it was in EA. It's probably completely abandoned by now. | At this point early on some of the things are polished, many need continued work.
The graphics are simple but work well for the game.
The game never crashed and everything was smooth for combat being turn based. 
It is fairly challenging to figure out what to do and how to get in a groove.  That itself is worth a few dollars.
After 20 hours I figured out eating food all the time, selling everything, and having several harvesting tools on your character are all critical.  

If your looking for a simple fun game to spend some time go for it, I believe it will improve with time.  IF your looking for 
total polish you may be dissapointed.  Videos and websites and even forums telling you what to do and how to do it are not going to be in abbundance.

For the price of a soda and some snacks what can be the harm.

150+ Hours Later . . and f2p opening up
The game still holds interest for me.  You do figure out tactics, what potions to use, what equipment to seek out or make for your character.  With the advent of some game updates you can adjust the scale of Random dungeons to suit your needs.  

Everything I still holds probably more true now than the day I wrote it.

Enjoy | - Whined like a child about basically forgetting my username and password.
- Developer was all, 'Hey bruh, what's good?
- Helped me gum it out live.
- Patched a gnarly interface snafu preventing redemption of code.

After a few hours of play, I like what I see. Great graphics (which have actually improved in clarity since the last time I loaded it up) and an in depth but well explained crafting setup.

- A good amount of materials drop from battles.
- The ability to buy items/bonuses with pay currency AND in game currency within reason (indie devs can learn a LOT about this sort of setup)
- What appears to be a pretty cool housing concept/FOB.
- Lag/rubberbanding has been reduced since I first played.

10/10 would make myself look like a moron again. This review will be updated as I play but, excellent job so far."
76561197976281073,722060,Dominions 5 - Warriors of the Faith,1588.0833333333333,"Indie, Strategy",0,"This game is good, but it's definitely not for everyone. The thumbs down is because I wanted to like this game more than I did. Some of the hours are just leaving the game online and reading a ton online.

The good;

1) I love it when a game offers more than one character to play as. In a strategic warfare game like this, I like that it offers a big choice of nations to choose from with different units. Each nation has its lore entry and the units have some descriptions to get you into the atmosphere.

2) There are a LOT of magic spells in this game. It's almost too many and it definitely feels overwhelming. But some of the systems are genuinely interesting and unique. Magic includes combat spells, rituals performed outside of combat and forging magic items.

3) A deep system for those interested.

The bad;

1) The interface is absolutely atrocious. It's not just minimalist, it is lacking in a way that I can only understand as laziness or lack of interest from the developers. Clearly it's working for the loyal fan base considering this is the 5th game in the series and there's currently a 6th. The first time I saw how obtrusive managing everything is I was surprised cause it seemed like the kind of flaw an indie on their first game would make, not someone on their 5th game.

2) The learning curve is HIGH. Half the time I've spent ""playing"" this game is reading the online wiki, the manual or looking up videos online which are very detailed. This might work for some, but I would rather spend it playing. Also, there's absolutely no tutorial to tell you how the game works.

3) I would be willing to overlook the lacking interface, the deep/high learning curve, the lack of a tutorial and the overwhelming systems of magic, but the thing that kind of makes me stop playing the game is how ""dry"" it is. When you play in single player there's a lore entry for the nation you play as, and there's a generic victory text that's the same for all nations. That's it. There's nothing in-between, no specific victory text for any nation or for the diety you play as. It's pretty much a digitized board game with some graphics.

Is this game bad? No, I wouldn't say so. It's clearly flawed by modern-gaming standards, but it's deep and there's a lot of attention paid here along with a great and interesting magic system. But it's absolutely not for everyone. I'm not upset that I got it because I got it for real cheap. I'm hoping in the future a Dominions game is released that's much more accessible and inviting.

Oh, by the way. Dominions 6 is -by most accounts- merely an updated Dominions 5, so I'm not expecting much soon. | Works without problems. Runs very fast. Easy to get into but hard to master. Wide choice of play options. | my god is she ugly but she can **** a mean **** | awesome"

They don't sell you complete games, they sell you some of a game then sell you many of the cool features that synergize with your favorite factions separately through DLC... if your favorite faction isn't a DLC in itself that is. Factions like Wood Elves are locked away behind over priced DLC you can only buy from TWW1 and there's now 3 TWW games, and many, many DLCs with bonus lords, heroes and entire factions locked away within them.

I'm playing a Dark Elf campaign and its a lot of fun to be honest. Being a dick head slaver is cool... what's not cool? Some of my best lords and heroes are locked away behind 2 different DLCs. The 'Master' hero who kicks butt and takes slaves, and the 'Supreme Sorcerer' lord, so you can have a powerful spellcaster instead of a typical warrior/captain Dreadlord. One of these DLCs are 18.99... the other is around 7 dollars. That's for ONE faction's complete roster and mechanics. If you want to play with multiple factions in their entirety through the 3 games?

(THERES A DEMO>>>TRY IT)
Pros...
It looks absolutely fantastic. The animations and the detail to the characters and the maps are really impressive.
Immersive.
Strategy seems solid. Lots of cards (150 or so atm with more to come)
Different factions. Orcs, Fay, Knights etc
You can change the colors and bases of your characters.
Cons...
It needs a more optimization atm. It runs at 60 most of the time but hits some issues fps wise sometimes.
No real progression atm. This is certainly going to be a feature at some point but for now after a win etc you don't really get anything.
This game looks like it is getting a store in game. That may be a bad thing depending on how the Dev runs it.
(Lets cross our fingers and hope he knows better then to shoot himself in the foot with p2w etc)

As a concept and what is to offer the game really has a solid base to work off of.
If you believe in the project I would say support it. The game is very unique in many ways.
If your looking for something with more progression atm then you may want to wait and see where it goes.

I'm giving the game a thumbs up atm. For the stage it is in it has a ton of potential. What is there is done very well.
I'll update this as any major changes/patches hit.
 | I'm only about 2 hours into the game so not a lot of playtime.  I purchased this more for the solo gaming aspect and not so much to build my own tabletop experience.  I must say, it is one of the harder hex-based games I've played in a long time.  It reminds me a little of Wartile, which I love.  However, in its current solo state, it lacks balance.  You have a handful of units that you can place in specific locations on the board.  And, in all the battles I have played thus far, the computer AI always gets to go first.  There is no initiative roll, etc.  Maybe that changes as you move deeper into the campaign.  The very first battle against the bandits was tough and took me abou8t 8 or 9 playthroughs before I was able to defeat it.  The next few encounters were much easier.  Then, I was trying to assist an outpost defend against an undead army.  There were about 3 friendly units that were overwhelmed almost immediately.  I had three units to start, a wizard, a friar and a healer.  I was pitted against about 10 or 11 enemy units.  The battle was impossible.  I spent a good hour trying various tactics to win and was barely able to scratch their units before my pitiful band was consumed.  Very disappointing as this game has great potential.  Maybe the product is geared more toward mapmaking, army building via cards, and sharing with your friends rather than the native solo battle.  I will asking for a refund for this due to its current state but will revisit it in the future to see if any improvements to the balance have been deployed. | Great game with alot of potential. Personally love the game and with the map editor there are endless possiblilties of what kind of games you can do. The Dev is also wonderful and was able to fix a major issue within an hour and is quite close with his community which is great to see. I can personally see myself playing this game for a long time. If you have any doubts please play the demo it has multiplayer and some of the single player options its defintley worth a go :) | So, I've played a bit of the game now and feel that I can give a decent review.

I don't feel the game is worth the price being asked for it, or the price that I got it for which was $20... A third off. I would pay $15 MAX for what I currently received.

The game is a lot like heroscape in terms of the board composition and units are similar to that of many of tabletop games where some units have some different abilities than others but all have a primary purpose. The main objective is to destroy your enemy's base and emerge victorious through careful planning and the use of strategy. The graphics are pretty good but in this kind of game, I don't think graphics really matter. It's more of a nice addition. I think the units are neat, they are diverse, and have different play styles depending on who you get and the faction you choose.

Overall, I like the game and look forward to more but microtransactions and VERY little content ruin it for me.

Last thing: There is already talk of microtransactions and this game is ""pre-alpha"". That scares me into not recommending it at this time for how little content there is and giving this warning. | I have  been playing strategy and tactical games since the sixties . Yeah! I know I should really grow up :D.
I just played the first Campaign and it’s really enjoyable. Took a bit of getting used, but I managed to finish it in a reasonable length of time(don’t forget I’m old) .

The potential for this game, or more accurately game system seem enormous. I see fantastic tactical squad battles will all sorts of armies real and imaginary.

I may have missed it, but I did not see a save function for the skirmish game or the campaign. I think it needs one so I hope it is in the works.

Anyway congratulations to the developer on a really fun game I look forward to spending a lot of time playing it.

76561197976281073,209670,Cortex Command,0.0,"Action, Indie, Strategy",0,"A great game left out in the rain by the developers. You can get the whole game for free and open source since the original creators did put out the code themself. I was really debating on if giving this a positive or negative rating was better, in the end is up to you how you spend money. The workshop is great so I would understand if that was a deciding factor. Personally I have no gripes with the game, only annoying thing they put in it was adverts for Planetoid Pioneers inside it. Planetoid Pioneers being the game that killed people's respect of the developers as it was shortly abandoned too.

Another reason I found it hard to review Cortex Command is trying to fit the gameplay in to a single genre. This has RTS aspects with the economy and battles, but it is also a very chill base builder. It has its economic managment phase, but also the abilily to gather and store wealth during battles for later use. If I was really forced to I would call it something it would be a 2D RTS with a strategy campaing in order to show the results of what you and the AI has made of the planet during corporate warfare. You really need to see it in order to get it.

Any negative review either mentions one of two things. One Data Realms behavior of abounding games and still selling a inferior bug ridden mess (I mean why buy this instead of downloading it for free?). Two the jank of this title. What makes Cortex Command so great is the engine, the terrain and units and vehicles all can be destroyed pixel by pixel. This can ofcourse lead to problems, you could get stuck on your own dead units or a mere pixel in the way. You could be thrown half across the battle field. You could even just die from something you didn't see. Yes there are a lot of crashes. I also  feel the only challange comes from the AI's ability to spam units and have them act on their own, out matches the player's ability to multitask and the rather piss poor auto commands you can give. For one player climbing is a pinch, for another is a unresolvable problem in the code.

The positive aspects is that the code is out there, and I have never seen as impressive mods as I have with this title. You can play with units and vechiles at such a size it boggles the mind. Nothing will preaper you from the joy of seeing all your carnage, wreckages, old fortifcations and corpses remaning battle from battle. I can't count how many times I even destroyed my own units to add flavor to the terrain is just that cool looking (the Star Destroyer being my personal favorite sprite). Some mods just makes this a whole different game, Void Wanderers is so good it could be sold on its own. Is also very natural how you control units and build, I had no problem learning to play on my own and unlike others never experinced any real issues with climbing ladders or interacting with items. No other games really gives me the feel anything I want is possible. | У меня с другом было наиграно сотни часов после учебы ))) С модами было очень весело играть.

However, if the new DEV team sticks with it, it will continue to grow. It's just a matter of continuing to push updates out and improving the engine (eventually at least to Unreal 4). The fact that people mistake this for Fortnite, constantly, because they would have looked the same in a year long past now, means it's popular enough to even be referenced against. Hitboxes are HUGE. The game allows you to be 'bad' but still be an okay player.

Crossplay is the only way to go right now as if you don't, you may not find a lobby to play in. Peak hours of filled lobbies seem to be between Noon CST till around 7pm. That's way better than how it was where it seemed 'dead' all the time.

IMO there's a LOT that still needs to be done. The former 'pros' still destroy people and if they continue to campy camp newer or just plain NEW players to this game, they'll not want to come back. Only way to really fix that is SBMM or add different modes like specifically ranked for the pros that want to fight others on their level and/or public type lobbies (like many other BR's have). I know that's probably way down the road, but it's going to have to happen to draw the players that can only play a couple hours a night because of their busy lives (aka casuals).

They've put some work into the new skins. New Battle Pass with this last update in November. New class, or rather a class brought back from Alpha. Rumors of another new class down the line. Ultimately people just have to have an interest in this game and there are a few creators that play this game that are IN FACT promoting the crap out of it. All in all, it's a fun little BR to get away from the others that are more 'serious' IMO.

Its alright, theres just better out there including  in the franchise | Years of XCOM franchise and worldbuilding gone to waste through typical American hero action movie vibes and limited gameplay. The game is repetitive, too long for the same ol' same ol' type of writing it introduces, and it's progression is very limited.

They are “I am so tolerant look at me” “I was on your side all the time” “I didn’t deserve this” or “I am a dumb racist”.

They made me hate a snake lady. I will never forgive them for this.
Also those awful portraits and general art style. Just why. And why they changed the mutton this much? This is X-Com not Lilo and Stich.
But that’s not even the worst point. No, the worst point is the only moral of the product: RACISM BAD. Now don’t put out the pitchforks yet. There is a teeny bitsy little thing to add.
RACISM (against the aliens that enslaved humanity, killed literally millions, put people in concentration camps and use them as food or slave labor or genetic experiments and had a unit 731 in every human city) BAD.
I want also to point out only FIVE years have been passed since X-Com 2 events. You remember how American people were so tolerant and friendly with Japanese after WW2? Or the polish with the Germans? Or the Chinese with the Japanese? Everybody knows we humans are a wonderful and tolerant race.
The product has the moral high ground to judge ANYONE who is against the established order RACIST BAD. There is no compromise, they are RACIST so you have to kill them on sight.
The bad guys are so comically evil, kids Sunday morning cartoons evil. They have no layers, they are bad, they do bad things you MUST hate them. You want more info? No, they are evil, they do bad things.
This is also a detriment for the gameplay. In SWAT games, literally and the genre, you are usually punished to shoot without warning or for cheap violence. You are there to arrest and defuse potential harm to civilians. That’s not the case, fuck them racist, kill ‘em all. 
In X-Com you have to kill on sight because there is a WAR on the background. Here you are in peace times. This product literally endorse police violence and brutality just because “they are racists man, they deserve it”. Oh but they are really smart pointing out “you are not the police”. You are acting like police, you are addressed as a police force, you are arresting and killing people in critical felony or criminal situations but nono, you are not the police.
Yes I know the aliens in X-Com are basically other alien races enslaved against their will. I know. But the product shouts in my hear 24\7 JUST ACCEPT IT. People MUST ACCEPT aliens in position of power, all over the media, basically having more power than humans. People MUST BE FRIENDLY WITH THEM OR BE KILLED OR ARRESTED. You really want me to believe in a democratic election an ALIEN won the major race. We have ALIEN social media “influencers”, cops are aliens, aliens in position of power. After all that happened? And everyone against this is “bad” by definition.
This is not even suspension of disbelief, this is insane agenda pushing. And we are not even talking about a world war, economic, political crisis. We are talking about the total enslavement of humanity, people eaten as FOOD and cruel abhorrent genetic experimentation. But yes, humans tend to forgive we are all happy under the rainbow.
This product had so much potential but they had to destroy it just to get woke\agenda\sjw\whatever pick your demon points creating the most absurd and incoherent worldbuilding over a 10+ games established franchise.
I played almost the two hours legal term for a refund, I looked on the internet for every info of the product I needed and I asked a refund for a product I paid 1 (one) euro because I don’t even want to see it in my list. Because those devs and this kind of product don’t deserve even ONE euro.
This is how mad I am with this awful product that probably is the last X-Com we will ever have."

It may not be for everyone because of its focus on the plot rather than focusing on gameplay. I personally like playing these types of games from time to time, so for the most part, story driven games boil down to your preference. I think this is a really good game, and it is worth while!

The only cons I have for the game is that some of the sound effects were taken straight out of Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. Some sounds will loop in the background and can get annoying to listen to. And finally, the monster in the game is not very threatening, and is easily avoided by simply not going near her. But, that won't be an issue since you can literally out-walk them.

For the most part, it's a decent little horror game. It's very short! You can easily beat the game in under two hours on a first play-through, so it's a good game to pass some time if your in the horror mood.

I'd give this game a solid 7/10. | [h2] 步步惊险的步行模拟器 [/h2]

Добре спрацьовує тільки як кампанія з відносно коротких місій, де університет треба відбудувати з нуля 7 разів з накопиченням певних загальних бонусів.

7/10. | There's fun to be had here but it's weighed down by a build system that is almost entirely RNG-based.

You collect gold, plus mana in each of several categories (obtained by your students studying that subject). When you get enough of a category you can draw a card for an item or new room of that category - you're presented with three options and pick one. These options are entirely RNG-based.

What that means is that you may go into a map thinking you want to try an Arcane and Nature school and then just never draw the requisite cards to get it going. Or, you may know you need more dormitories for your students but the game just never gives you the card. You can't really plan the school out because you really have no idea what the game is going to let you build with the bizarre luck-of-the-draw system.

On the plus side, there's a lot of charm in the graphics and the game does a great job with the ""feel"" of magic. The classrooms are cool and your kids can get items like devil's horns, staves, regalia, etc. It really does feel like a magic school.

It's just such an odd choice from the developers to make the build system completely based on dice rolls. | I love this game, the main campaign is perfect, there is some replay ability, if you like experimenting, I do. Definitely recommend, my only gripe is that I selfishly want more.

At a certain point i started playing endless, but I wish there was more story, unless I'm missing something, I wish there was a secret to uncover or the dungeons just available or for quests to keep coming. In endless mode it hits a lull, I'd like for there to be more action, maybe the factions go to war or something, see what happens if you and the certain groups are friends. See students join different factions and maybe that gives you influence during encounters because your student runs a specific department for that faction. I think fleshing out a little more story based details would make endless actually go on for a lot longer before hitting a lull. | 好玩但是很卡真的很卡，慎玩 | Great theme and art style.

À l’époque, ma grand-mère, qui était comme une deuxième mère pour moi, venait de nous quitter. Sa mort a laissé un vide immense dans notre famille. J’avais l’impression que tout s’était arrêté. Je n’arrivais plus à avancer, ni dans mes études, ni dans ma vie quotidienne.

Un soir, en cherchant quelque chose pour me changer les idées, je suis tombé sur The Tiny Bang Story. J’ai été attiré par ses graphismes doux, comme tirés d’un rêve. En lançant le jeu, je me suis plongé dans ce petit monde coloré et brisé, où tout était à reconstruire. Ce n’était pas juste un puzzle, c’était une métaphore parfaite de ce que je vivais.

Chaque énigme que je résolvais, chaque pièce que je remettais en place, me donnait une sensation de calme et de réconfort. Le jeu n’avait pas de texte ou de dialogue, juste une musique apaisante et un univers silencieux, comme si c’était fait pour m’aider à retrouver un peu de paix dans ce chaos.

Je me souviens d’un soir où, après avoir passé des heures sur une énigme, j’ai fini par éclater en sanglots. Ce n’était même pas à cause du jeu, mais parce qu’il m’avait donné l’espace dont j’avais besoin pour ressentir, pour laisser sortir tout ce que j’avais gardé en moi depuis la perte de ma grand-mère.

The Tiny Bang Story n’est pas juste un jeu pour moi, c’est une expérience. Il m’a aidé à me reconstruire, tout doucement, comme je reconstruisais son petit monde. Et même si la vie n’est pas aussi simple qu’un puzzle, il m’a montré que, parfois, assembler les petites pièces, une à la fois, suffit pour commencer à avancer. | 目前个人评分（8/10）点点点，考验眼力，找不着了就点小蜜蜂，懒得点小蜜蜂就直接查攻略，拼图还挺有意思的 | Beating it in 3 hours, not too hard puzzles with help if one feel that is necessary.

补充：实际上直接找到游戏文件夹（STEAM-库-Prismata-右键-属性-游戏文件夹，把steam彻底关闭退出后台，直接运行游戏，不会调用steam，不计时...... | As someone who can only play StarCraft 2 with ~50APM and failed to defend fast pool everytime, I really love Prismata. A very complex and interesting turn based strategy game. Even as a professional mathematician, I find puzzles and matches in this game deep, hard and very exciting. Different from most of the modern card/turn based strategy games, this game has almost no RNG (except the coinflip in the beginning of each match, and randomized advanced units, which are the same for both side), and all information is open to both side, so calculation and prediction play very very important role here.

The learning curve is somehow steep. More or less like a good RTS game, there are things to memorize: common openings, tricks and trades... But luckliy, there are very good articles about these aspects already: google Prismata library. Once you get over the basics, every game becomes very exciting and unique.

That said, this game is not for everyone. It is for those people who like rigorous strategy and calculation, and hate the gamble effect RNG brings. A very unique game, also well polished. And somehow to my surprise, the in game chat and the community is very friendly, helpful and very warmful towards new players. 

 | This game is the absolute pinnacle of turn-based strategy. It is really a surprise I only heard about this game now, a few days after the release on steam, even though the game has existed for over 3 years I heard. And why you definitely SHOULD buy this game? Here are a few examples of my reasons behind my decision to get Prismata:
- I like chess, I've played HS, Gwent, Duel of Champions, Fire Emblem and loads of other different turn based strategy games, but I have never come across anything like Prismata before. The combination of no RNG(apart from coinflip, which has around the same effect as chess) and very complex game mechanics which need to be perfectly executed or you literally can lose instantly, really creates a very competetive and interesting game environment, where you always feel you can improve gameplaywise after any given game.
- Prismata has been made super-indie, by only a couple of people and because of that has a completely different mindset compared to for example Duel of Champions, which is another game I also loved, although it was shut down by Ubisoft. The developers have clearly emphazised how much it means for them to create a no-p2w environment where you don't have to grind for the cards, or anything, although this is not a card game but a resource management game. Completely opposed to for example the ""pay until you are broke"" - method which sounds like to be the monetization option for Valve's newest ""strategy"" game Artifact and many other similar games in 1v1 strategy genre in general.
- The developers have come up with a really clever solution to prevent the game from every getting solved, or repetitive, as the available ""card"" pool for both players is partly randomized every game. And yes for both players means both players have the same options, in every game, negating most balance issues with cards being overpowered or too weak, as you cannot choose what to take with you ingame.
- The lack of deckbuilding was a weird thought for me at first, but it actually is the perfect solution for any game like this. The reason why card games or other strategy games which involve deck building of some kind get tiresome rather quickly, unless new cards are added very often, which has its own issues with balancing and older cards getting useless and price for new players etc. Although I repeat, this is NOT a card game even though it maybe might seem like one when you take a first look at the UI, I feel that comparisons to popular card games work well with this game, as the strategy is in the end somewhat similar, just without the surprise factor of your opponent having a hand you cannot see. When the options are open to inspection for both players, the mindgames really kick in. And as every game is different and you have to figure out a new strategy for every given game, and also look out for what your opponent is doing, the game will never feel stale!
- Since steam release although the success isn't like HS level, I have had no trouble finding opponents when queueing. Also the AI is really challenging and the single player missions are already so difficult that it feels like they have a lot more content than they  actually do, funnily enough. I like the art style of the game even though I have seen many people calling it ""cheap"" or ""mobile like"", but tbh I think for such a small development team the art style is more than good enough, and main plus I'd say every unit at least feels unique and distinct, thanks to the artwork.
- Main positive is the mechanics though, but explaining all those in a single review might take a little too long, but I just say that after turn one, literally anything is possible. The units have cool combos and setting up situations where you will end up ahead in the long run is crucial to winning any game, and the key is WHEN to do things or not.

Negatives:
-Price of the game can feel a bit high (around 21€ for me with the first DLC) but it did feel worth it for me after I played a while. The game will likely be free to play some point but I wouldn't wait for it as the founder edition has some cool bonuses, like letting you unlock the various skins and other cosmetics for the units a lot easier. Talk about supporting a great game!
- The skill ceiling is REALLY HIGH, like yeah this game is not for everyone, it can feel overwhelming without any experience about these kind of strategy games, and it will take a while even for more experienced puzzle solvers like me to get the hang of it. But if you feel like you are up for a challenge, you will get it.
- If you require GWENT level of art, then maybe this game is not for you. | 卡在界面进不去，开加速也不行，希望官方能提供一个解决办法，不止我一个人遇到了。游戏先好评支持了。 | Summary:  Prismata is turn-based Starcraft meets Magic: the Gathering.  It's recommended if you like the resource management and build optimization of Starcraft, but find unit micromanagement frustrating.  Also recommended if you like the tactical gameplay of Magic: the Gathering, but dislike the cost of collecting cards and dislike games being determined by which player draws the right cards.

Pros: 
- Deep and unique strategic gameplay
- All players on an even playing field
- Every game plays out differently
- Excellent, non-cheating AI with a broad range of difficulties
- Rich support for competitive play
- Very affordable

Cons:
- Small, hardcore playerbase
- Sometimes makes me feel dumb
- Skins only obtainable through a microtransaction slot machine

Prismata is one of those rare genre-innovator games for which it is difficult to make direct comparisions to other games, but which is, in retrospect, surprising that something similar hasn't been done before.  The best summary is ""Starcraft, the card game.""

Over the course of a match, you and your opponent will take turns building units by spending resources in exchange for playing cards to form a tableu of units, selecting some units to attack your opponent, and managing your defenses.  However, instead of playing units from a hand of cards, they are built from a card pool which allows all units to be built at any time, provided you have the required resources available.  This unit pool of fifteen to twenty-two units is randomly generated at the start of each match from a library of more than one hundred options, changing the optimal strategy each game, and rewarding the player more able to adapt their own strategy to the available choices.

The units themselves are purchased using five different categories of resources.  At the start of a match, you start with two engineers, which produce energy, and a handful of drones, which produce gold.  (The first player gets six drones, and the second player gets seven.)  You can use energy to produce more drones, and use gold to purchase other units and structures.  These structures produce additional red, green and blue resources, which are further required to buy more advanced units.

Some units are purely economic, others can attack your opponent, others defend against attacks, and some can do both.  Many of the more expensive units have an ability which you can choose to activate once a turn, perhaps spending some resources, perhaps making that unit unavailable to defend, in exchange for some positive effect.  The five categories of resources, the wide variety of units with unique effects, and the attacking and defending phases bring to mind Magic: the Gathering as a gameplay comparison.  However, unlike Magic, the same units are available to both players during the game, and unlike Magic, there is no need to buy card packs in order to get access to units.

Because the only randomness during the match is the selection of units available, and because the same units are available to both players, the winner of a match is determined only by he who makes the best decisions.  This can be very rewarding when you win, but when you lose, there isn't anything to blame but your own poor performance.  This isn't Hearthstone, where you can shift the blame to the random number generator.  This isn't League of Legends, where you can scapegoat your teammates.

The high learning curve of Prismata and lack of random elements means that acquiring the skills required to succeed against other players can be a frustrating experience.  This is particularly the case because the player population is somewhat small, with less than two hundred players online at any given time, and quite hardcore.  If you are the sort of player that is easily frustrated by losing, this may not the game for you.  However, if you respond to a losing streak by trying to analyze your mistakes and attempt to ""git gud"", to put it in the parlance of our subculture, then Prismata will be a rewarding.

The game does provide the tools for improving your performance.  There is a replay system allow you to review your mistakes and do ""what-if"" scenarios to see if different decisions would have led to better results.  You can also spectate top-level players in-game, making the game itself a rich environment to learn from the best.

Mitigating the initially brutal multiplayer experience is a lengthy set of single-player battle training missions.  These missions walk you through available tactics and strategies for effective Prismata play.  You can expect to spend twenty hours or more progressing through the single player content.  Also available is a very capable AI opponent, with many difficulty settings, which should allow anyone to find the right level of challenge.  

Currently, Prismata is available through Steam for $25 USD, and the value for dollar at that price point is very generous.  However, be aware that Prismata will, in the future, be a free-to-play game with microtransactions.  The full gameplay experience will be available for free.  Whales will be on even footing with the completely free-to-play player.

However, skins for your units are acquired through a microtransaction slot machine which seems optimally designed to bilk the potential problem gambler.  A trifecta of exploitation makes this so:  difficult to estimate probabilities, cognitive biases about loss aversion, and an in-game currency creating psychological distance from real-world dollar value.  Of course, these skins are cosmetic only, providing no in-game advantage, so you are free to ignore them entirely.  But the process of acquiring skins does feel a little slimey.  I'd strongly prefer directly spending money on skins, instead.

If you are interested in Prismata, I would recommend buying in at the asking price on Steam, since it does give you extra single player content, but if you are unwilling to pay the asking price and can't wait for the free-to-play roll out, be aware that sometimes streamers on Twitch have keys to give to new players, and apparently there is a Discord where you can ask for a key and get one.  I've also seen the developer give keys to people asking about the game on the Prismata subreddit."

第一，这个游戏我玩这么久了，从来没有使用过任何作弊工具进入对战平台，连人机也没有使用过！
第二，我玩这个游戏的时候曾经确实使用过第三方的工具，不过也是用于通关剧情模式的。但是这个游戏也没有说过使用第三方工具通关剧情模式也会被封号吧？？？而且也是我很早以前使用过的。

在今天，我想通过STEAM的推荐系统，对水雷社的开发人员讲！这是我辛辛苦苦养的第二个号，结果在又被封了！希望能给我的线上权限解BAN，我也会持续在社区平台和水雷社的官方留言板上继续上诉！！直到解封为止！

Hello everyone! I am an old player who has been playing this game for a long time. I rarely go to the Sky Ladder PK and usually use drones for retirement. The game is indeed a good game, but I have witnessed the inexplicable account suspension!!! I would like to say to customer service or developers:
Firstly, I have been playing this game for so long and have never used any cheating tools to enter the battle platform, not even the human-machine interface!
Secondly, I did use third-party tools when playing this game, but they were also used to clear the storyline mode. But this game has never mentioned that using third-party tools to complete the storyline mode will also result in account suspension, right??? And it's also something I used a long time ago.
Today, I want to talk to the developers of the Minesweeper Society through STEAM's recommendation system! This is the second account I have worked hard to raise, but it has been banned again! I hope to be granted online access to unban, and I will continue to appeal on the community platform and the official message board of the Minesweeper Society!! Until the lockdown is lifted! | One of the greatest RTS games ever made and significantly better than 3 which is an absolute pos game. My recommendation if you want the dlc for this game is to go online and find a cheap steam key for the ""all out war edition"" usually around 8$. Gives you every single dlc in the game including all playable factions, so don't waste your money on individual dlc which will cost you a fortune. | I don't even know where to start. The gameplay can be satisfying at times but almost every other aspect of the game is downright frustrating and/or pathetic. Had I known that the campaign was strictly Russia vs Germany, I wouldn't have bought it. Had I known how greedy the game is with all the microtransactions and extra dlc you have to buy for a complete game, I wouldn't have bothered. 

You cannot play as either British or American forces unless you pay extra. Furthermore, you cannot play as any army except for Russia in any of the one-off skirmish maps, unless you pay extra. Also, there are campaign missions that it shows you in-game where you play as the allies, but to play them you have to pay extra. Showing you the other half of what the game should have been with price tags and store page links inside the damn game is so insulting. 

I got it relatively cheap on the winter sale, otherwise I would've refunded it. Odds are, you won't have a good time with this game. I hear Coh3 is even worse, so there you go. Another dead franchise swallowed up by corporate greed. | This game is timeless. not sure what is it that brings me back to it. it is not perfect especially the campaign, but the multiplayer comes so close to perfection. | Game no longer loads, tried every solution possible, nothing. Hundreds of others having the same issue with no developer support for a fix. Money goneski."

With the number of hours I'd played I even spent over 100$ supporting the game by buying skins and what not. I enjoyed the flow, the challenge, and the strategy. I know every card. How they're played. How they're countered. 

So why am I giving it a negative review now?  I recently came back to it to find out the game had completely changed. 

Why oh why have the devs decided to remove wild cards (doubles of the same card in the same deck) and duplicate cards (the same card in your teammates deck) in premade team battles?? Half the fun of this game was being able to strategize with a friend and come up with crazy combos, thematic decks, and sometimes just plain goofy ridiculous decks early in the league. I strongly believe the percent chance of drawing a deck defining card or executing your intended combo is a key element of dueling cards in general. Think Magic or Yu Gi Oh. Now a huge part of that fun and build design is just gone.

Effectively, they've changed the game that I originally fell in love with and after over 800 hours I don't think I want to play anymore. What a shame. | Rating: 7/10

Overview: Minion Masters is a fast-paced, free-to-play strategy game that blends elements of tower defense and collectible card games (CCG). Developed by BetaDwarf, the game pits players in 1v1 or 2v2 battles where they summon and control minions to battle against their opponent’s forces, all while managing a deck of cards. With its unique mix of gameplay styles, Minion Masters offers an accessible but strategic experience for fans of both strategy games and card battling.

Gameplay: In Minion Masters, players build and use decks of cards to summon minions, cast spells, and build structures on the battlefield. Each card corresponds to a different type of unit, spell, or structure that players can deploy in real-time. The key to success is not just about deploying powerful units but also about managing your resources (mana), timing your plays, and reacting to your opponent’s strategy.

The game offers several different modes, including standard 1v1 and 2v2, where players can compete against other players or AI. The matches are quick, lasting around 5-10 minutes, which makes it easy to jump into a game and not get bogged down by long sessions. The action is fast-paced, with constant back-and-forth gameplay, making it exciting for those who enjoy real-time strategy with a bit of card game strategy mixed in.

Deck Building and Strategy: The strategic depth of Minion Masters comes from deck building. Players can collect new cards and customize their deck to suit their playstyle, with different minions, spells, and special abilities available to choose from. The key to winning is finding the right balance between offense and defense, while also considering synergy between the cards in your deck. There are a variety of minion types, each with strengths and weaknesses, which adds an extra layer of tactical decision-making to each match.

Progression and Monetization: As with many free-to-play games, Minion Masters includes a progression system where players can unlock new cards and cosmetics by earning rewards from matches or purchasing card packs. While the game is generally balanced and not pay-to-win, there is an option for players to spend money on card packs and other cosmetic items. This could give some players a slight advantage early on, but most progress can still be made through regular gameplay.

Graphics and Performance: Minion Masters features bright, colorful visuals with a somewhat cartoonish art style that fits the fast-paced, playful nature of the game. The minions and spells are well-designed, with each card having its own unique look and animations that help bring the battlefield to life. The game runs smoothly on most systems, and the controls are intuitive, making it accessible for both new players and strategy veterans alike.

Audio Design: The sound design in Minion Masters is solid, with an upbeat soundtrack and engaging sound effects that add to the excitement of the battles. Each card and minion has its own set of sounds, from the footsteps of marching troops to the explosive effects of spells, helping to immerse players in the game’s action. The voice lines of the minions and the announcer are charming and add some personality to the game.

Challenges: While Minion Masters is accessible, there is a learning curve when it comes to building effective decks and mastering the timing and positioning of your units. As players unlock more cards, they can start building more diverse strategies, but the game’s fast pace means you need to react quickly, which can be challenging for newcomers. The game also features matchmaking, but occasionally, you may find yourself up against opponents who have stronger cards if you're not progressing quickly enough.

Final Thoughts: Minion Masters is a fun and fast-paced strategy game that offers a unique blend of collectible card gameplay with real-time strategy. Its quick matches, deck-building mechanics, and strategic depth make it an enjoyable experience for players who enjoy both card games and strategy games. While there’s a progression system that could feel grindy at times, the game remains accessible, and its focus on skill and strategy makes it rewarding for those who stick with it.

Pros:

Fast-paced and accessible gameplay
Strong strategic depth through deck-building and unit placement
Bright, colorful visuals with appealing animations
Free-to-play with fair monetization options
Multiple game modes including 1v1 and 2v2
Cons:

Progression can feel slow at times
Pay-to-progress elements, though not pay-to-win
Some balancing issues, especially at early levels
Can become repetitive if not switching up strategies
Minion Masters is an enjoyable strategy game for those who like quick battles, tactical decision-making, and card collection. While there are some minor progression hurdles, the game offers a solid and fun experience for fans of competitive, strategic gameplay. | This game was fun for a while. I found it late thinking it was a new game. After several months of loving it and playing it almost daily; the fun is now at its end. Nothing new is coming to it. | ""Если бы мне сказали, что я буду проводить ночи напролет, крича на экран из-за толпы миньонов, я бы не поверил. Но вот я здесь, с кругами под глазами и улыбкой до ушей. Minion Masters — это как смесь покера, шахмат и цирка, где все участники слегка не в себе.

Что мне нравится:

Миньоны-психопаты. Серьезно, кто еще будет бросать летающих свиней в драконов? Это гениально!

Стратегия? Шутка? И то, и другое! Ты думаешь, что всё продумал, но тут твой противник выкидывает карту, которая превращает твою армию в лягушек. Лягушек, Карл!

Быстрые матчи. Это как фастфуд, только без угрызений совести. 5 минут — и ты либо герой, либо лузер. Но в любом случае хочется еще.

Что не нравится:

Случайные карты. Иногда тебе выпадает такая рука, что хочется плакать. Но это часть веселья, правда?

Итог: Minion Masters — это идеальная игра для тех, кто хочет немного адреналина, много смеха и возможность почувствовать себя злым гением (или просто неудачником с хорошим чувством юмора). Если вы еще не играли, то что вы вообще делаете со своей жизнью?

Начнём с того, что может не понравится некоторым игрокам:
1. Игра точно мотивирует пройти её несколько раз, при том, что она является сюжетной. Мотивирует ачивками, открытием новых министров, бонусами на следующие прохождения, невозможностью увидеть всё за один раз. Могут ли там быть разные концовки? Да, немного разные концовки могут быть, в зависимости от некоторых решений в процессе президентства, но вариантов их там не много. Игра в любом случае, закончится после двух президентских сроков [spoiler](если быть совсем точным, второй раз выиграть выборы придётся для достижения хотя бы относительно позитивного итога, но третий срок отсиживать уже не придётся из-за определённого ключевого события, которое случится буквально через несколько месяцев после второй победы на выборах)[/spoiler], поэтому сравнивать её с политическими бесконечными песочницами совершенно нельзя. С другой стороны, у меня не было ощущения, что я хочу продолжить дальше, то есть мне было интересно ровно до того момента, когда как раз концовка и наступает - именно в этот момент понимаешь, что хочешь закончить. Так что какой-никакой приятный баланс тут соблюдён, просто не факт, что всем игрокам захочется играть многократно.
2. Игра не представляет собой слишком глубокую симуляцию политических процессов, то есть не стоит ждать от неё чего-то масштабов «Tropico». Но в то же время она не представляет собой и быстро надоедающий симулятор иконок, связей и табличек, вроде «Democracy», где подвигал всё везде в нужную тебе сторону и радуйся - смысла в ней сидеть дольше часа больше нет. Игра и тут успешно балансирует где-то между... поэтому может не зайти любителям либо одного, либо другого. Она не пытается быть серьёзной, но она может быть такой. Она не пытается быть хардкорной, но называть её казуальной - язык не поворачивается.

Теперь то, что точно может быть приятно в этом политическом симуляторе:
1. В нём требуется балансировать между разными регионами страны, где могут быть сильно разные люди с разными потребностями. Учитывая то, что игра каждое новое прохождение генерирует карту (да, карта там не статичная - она при каждой новой игре будет немного разной, её генерацию можно настраивать: другие ресурсы, другие ключевые точки, другое физическое состояние страны, другие опасные места, другие соседи и тому подобное), то регионы тоже могут поменяться. Смотришь налево - там огромный сельхозрегион с лугами и сёлами, где верят в странную местную религию; смотришь в центр - там небольшой урбанизированный регион с огромными городами, где преобладает уже образованное либеральное городское население; смотришь направо - там вообще горный регион, где население преимущественно составляет этническое меньшинство, которое вообще не против отделиться от страны, вот только там у них выход к морю и главный порт в стране... И, при каждой генерации, подобные региональные вызовы меняются. И, если уж не всех этих разных людей с разными желаниями, то хотя бы большинство, надо удовлетворить к выборам, иначе не победить.
2. Механики и геймплей достаточно масштабны, чтобы их можно было похвалить: тут таблицы и графики, ползунки бюджетов и прочие элементы, которые любят хардкорщики; тут и строительство ключевых зданий и нужных местах, прокладка дорог и транспортная логистика, любимые градостроителями; тут и постоянные политические дилеммы, которые надо разрешать, так любимые казуальщиками. Кажется, игра пыталась сесть сразу на все стулья. И, кажется, у неё даже получилось, потому что ничего из этого нет так много, чтобы задушить. Оно всё как-то органично сменяет друг друга на экране игрока.
3. Игра изобилует разными необычными фишками: видеовставки, некоторый юмор, невероятные случайные события... всё это дополнительного разноображивает геймплей и механики, которые и без того, достаточно широки. Настолько широки, что в некоторых вещах стоит даже поискать гайды или спрашивать у игравшего друга, что делать.

Итог: я однозначно могу сказать, что игра мне понравилась и видно, как разработчики старались наполнить её контентом. И, пусть она не получилась масштабов глобальных стратегий от «Paradox», где игроки запускают сотни разных каток и сидят в них тысячи часов, игра правда может иногда напомнить о себе и заставить пройти новую катку. Было бы даже интересно посмотреть, что бы получилось у разработчиков, если бы у них были бюджеты и сроки на создание глобальной стратегии. Я бы с удовольствием такое увидел. На фоне позитивных эмоций от игры тонут некоторые ошибки локализации, не очень удобное управление войсками и редкие вылеты, но не сказать про это, не могу (пусть те, кто сочтёт нужным прочесть этот обзор, будут в курсе их наличия). Но эта игра заслужила, чтобы я проигнорировал огрехи и играл несколько раз, потому что она хотела быть не такой, как все. Я не знаю, придутся ли кому-то всё эти креативы по душе ещё, но игра точно достойна ознакомления с ней и покупки (тем более на неё бывают огромные скидки по 80%). | Overly complicated slide juggler and builder that feels more like whack-a-mole than a 4x strategy. | Best.

Just can't anymore.
When Bungie actually puts in effort into their game (Aka, major DLC's minus lightfall) the game is amazing, but the amount of times they have dropped the ball, especially with this last episode/season has finally done it for me. I've followed Destiny since the original on the xbox 360, became a fan of the story, and continued on into Destiny 2 back when they were still part of activision on battlenet. I've always attempted to keep good faith and put in a good word even when the game was at a low point, but now after having the saint-14 and osiris gay love story interjected and shoved down my throat multiple times, the last season ""echos"" big bad guy get one shot in a cutscene and escape by floating down a vex ""milk"" river, and now the current episode which started by reusing a game mode that they butchered and made worse than the original which was still in the game and the other gamemode that came later which was decent but had loot that you could get just by running around in the standard maps made it not at all worth doing. Compound that with the tonic system that relied on Strict RNG to get new tonics which were necessary to get further in the reputation system and played a minimal part in the over arching story and took forever just to get three tonics out of DOZENS WHICH BARELY WORKED AND WAS ON A TIMER THAT YOU HAD TO MICRO MANAGE ON TOP OF OTHER MICRO MANAGING SYSTEMS.... yeah it was just TOO MUCH.  The final nail in the coffin was the fact that we found out just how much work they put into the seasonal / episodic content which normally is spread out when they gave it all at one time. By the way you could do all 3 parts of revenant in less than 3 hours which for something that you pay for is absolutely Pathetic. For comparison Warframe Is completely 100% FREE and has proven to have a better player experience, impactful story, developers that actually care, better visuals, smaller file size, did not take paid content away forever (yes that happened in destiny), and more. 

I loved this game because it's story at one point was amazing and now... it's a chore.  Combine all that with the current state of the company's choices and behaviors, it's just not worth trying to keep the rose tinted glasses on and support it anymore.  I loved this game.... and I just feel betrayed and disappointed.  Call me a Schill, say I'm coping, or a hater I no longer care. Like many said Destiny was the only thing that could Kill Destiny, and well they did it.  I'm done supporting Bungie until they get their collective heads out of their ass.

Edit as to Toasty's comments, I don't care if Osiris and Saint are gay, I care that the fact that they are gay is more of a Slap to the face and is way too frequent as a main story beat, it's not subtle like other characters and kept in the background as an aspect of the character which would have made the first Episode much more impactful story wise. As Toasty mentioned Warframe has these notions and explores it but it's subtle and not in  your face and distracting from the overall story which is why I exemplify it's story over This one. Take that as you will but I stand with my choice and opinion, don't be assholes just because you disagree and have a different opinion. | 10 year veteran of the franchise. this new season brings to me the unfortunate realization its over. the game had the most amazing expansion in its history, just to turn around and fire loads of staff. bungie vets who made this series what it is (was practically) are gone, and you can feel it. new season with no exotic armor at all, mediocre activity that is just the same recycled event, with recycled modifiers from older content that is extremely tiring, just cus it worked once doesnt mean they need to do it 3 or so times. the sandbox is in a pretty great state, but the creativity of the team is dying out, and the lack of employees and budget is extremely obvious. Pete Parsons is directly responsible for cutting hundreds of devs and bringing this ship crashing into the ground. Destiny is genuinely unenjoyable and within the hour i was bored. this is genuinely depressing as i have thousands of hours, and thousands on psn and have loved the game through some of its lowest points. but the mediocrity of this season is killing me. i genuinely am worried this game will actually die for real within this act. | I think this is the best game ever made and it's not very close. I started playing around the time it went free to play and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. No other game does what this one does. I think everyone should get to experience what Destiny offers. This rating is positive because of what this game has meant to me, not because of what it has become.

	[*]This game is so unfairly priced that I can't genuinely recommend any of my non-Destiny friends or new players to pick it up to try it out.
	[*]The community is toxic as hell.
	[*]The game is dying, fewer and fewer people get on to play every single day.
	[*]There are cheaters in 1/3 of Crucible games (might just be caused by the dwindling player count making the concentration of cheaters higher).
	[*]Every new update is bugged (sometimes to the point of unplayability) and results in either server downtime, another update to address it (takes a month for this to get released), or Bungie just giving up and auto-completing quest steps.
	[*]The new player onboarding experience is abysmal. You're given a 5 minute cutscene to explain the story (since they completely removed the real campaign), a couple of introductory quests, and then you're kicked out of the bird's nest to do whatever your heart desires with minimal direction or suggestion on where to go. So bad, in fact, that Bungie has given up and now provides players with an option to skip it entirely since they know that if a new player is playing this game, it MUST be at the direction of another existing player telling them what to do anyway.
	[*]The game is riddled with power creep. Guardian kits are the strongest they have ever been and new aspirational content has gotten easier and easier.
[/list]

Realistically, the game needs a reset like Destiny 1 got with the release of Destiny 2, but Bungie's insistence on this being a forever game post-Final Shape has led to Destiny 3 being nothing but a pipe dream while this game wanes in its final days after the equivalent of an Avenger: Endgame story beat. Bungie just doesn't know when to let it go.

The gun play is one of the best in any game I have ever played and the charachters are very fun. However I can’t recommend the game strictly on the monetization. For example before this new season (24) there were leaked mini battle passes for all of the new legends that would add a ton of progression that was desperately needed. It would have given the players something worth playing for. But what does EA do? Make you pay 10$ for each one. This isn’t even mentioning the collection events that cost 300+ dollars to complete. They also just added a new mobile game pay system that makes you pay to unlock something cheap and then to unlock something free. All the skins are also egregiously overpriced in general. It’s all there to just make you spend as much money as possible it’s trash. They don’t really care about the players they care about the money that’s it.

A few of the selling points are as follows:

1.Killer Campaign: It's not the longest in history, but an excellent story with a few adrenaline pumping moments and fluid gameplay. The game cleverly weaves mechanics together that never subtract, only add to the way you play.

2.Movement:This game has such a fluid movement system, it always feels like reaching a new spot to kill an enemy always feels possible. The transitions are smooth and intuitive

3. Gunplay- Amazing set of firearms that readily invite plenty of customization. The guns feel good to shoot and never feel clunky

4.MECHS- I for one am obsessed with mechs, and this game really scratches the itch. The titan classes are both fun and interesting to learn, each with their own personality in multiplayer

Respawn, if you're listening... I will gladly support a titanfall 3 if it ever comes to surface.

10/10 Titanfalls | Titanfall 2 is nothing short of a gem in the world of first-person shooters, blending fluid mechanics, engaging storytelling, and thrilling mech-based combat into one unforgettable package. Released in 2016, it stands as a testament to how innovation in game design can produce something truly special. However, despite its brilliance, the game now faces challenges in its multiplayer landscape, largely due to being overshadowed by its battle royale sibling, Apex Legends.

[h1]Campaign: A Perfectly Executed Storyline[/h1]
One of the standout features of Titanfall 2 is its campaign mode, which is widely regarded as one of the best in FPS history. The story revolves around Jack Cooper, a humble rifleman who unexpectedly forms a bond with a Vanguard-class Titan, BT-7274, after his pilot is killed in action. Their journey together is emotional, exciting, and filled with clever twists. The dynamic between Jack and BT brings heart to the narrative, making the story more than just a vehicle for the action.
Each mission introduces new mechanics that keep the gameplay fresh, from wall-running platforming challenges to time-travel puzzles. The creativity behind these sequences ensures that every level feels unique, culminating in a finale that will leave you in awe.

[h1]Gameplay: Smooth, Fast, and Addictive[/h1]
Titanfall 2's gameplay is its crown jewel. The movement mechanics are unmatched, offering fast-paced wall-running, double-jumping, and parkour-like traversal that feels incredibly fluid and rewarding. Whether you’re darting across walls in a tight gunfight or dropping into a Titan from orbit, the gameplay never stops being exhilarating.
The combat offers a seamless blend of infantry and mech-based gameplay. Titans, the giant mechanized war machines, add a layer of strategy to the combat. Each Titan comes with unique abilities and playstyles, ensuring there’s something for everyone. Pilots and Titans complement each other perfectly, making every battle feel dynamic and intense.

Multiplayer: A Double-Edged Sword[/h1]
Titanfall 2’s multiplayer was revolutionary at launch, providing chaotic and action-packed matches where players could seamlessly switch between Pilots and Titans. Modes like Attrition and Last Titan Standing kept players hooked with a mix of tactical and frenetic gameplay. The progression system, customization options, and map designs were all top-notch.
Unfortunately, time has not been kind to Titanfall 2’s multiplayer. With the rise of Apex Legends, Respawn Entertainment’s wildly popular battle royale game, Titanfall 2's servers have become much less active. It’s a sad reality that this incredible multiplayer experience has been largely abandoned by the player base, leaving many matches sparsely populated or difficult to find. For a game that thrives on competitive energy, this lack of activity is a noticeable drawback.

[h1]Graphics and Sound Design: A Feast for the Senses[/h1]
Visually, Titanfall 2 still holds up beautifully, even years after its release. The environments are diverse and detailed, ranging from lush forests to industrial war zones. The Titans themselves are intricately designed, showcasing their power and scale.
The sound design is equally impressive. The heavy footsteps of a Titan, the crackling of energy weapons, and the atmospheric music all combine to immerse players in the game’s sci-fi universe. It’s a sensory experience that feels both grand and intimate.

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
Titanfall 2 is a masterclass in first-person shooter design. Its innovative gameplay, heartfelt campaign, and exhilarating multiplayer make it one of the finest FPS games of its generation. However, the decline in multiplayer activity and the rise of Apex Legends have left this incredible game underappreciated by newer audiences.
If you haven’t experienced Titanfall 2 yet, it’s a must-play for the campaign alone. It’s a love letter to innovation in gaming, and for those lucky enough to find a multiplayer match, it’s a reminder of what peak FPS multiplayer can look like. Whether you’re new to the series or a returning fan, Titanfall 2 deserves your attention, it’s a game that truly deserves to stand tall, even if its servers are quiet. | Worth it for the campaign alone, but you get a sick co-op mode on top!

e se tu nunca jogou um game da from software antes, comece por aqui. acredito que elden ring seja mais fácil que dark souls 1, 2 e 3, no quesito de ser muito explicativo e fácil de pegar o jeito, até o parry é mais fácil. (pelo menos pra mim, que ja joguei os três e tive essa visão)

e como costumo dizer... gostar de jogos soulslike é uma referência a vida real, você vai apanhar até aprender, mas quando aprender, vai ser prazeroso cada momento.

*ler mensagem:* contemple... o anel pristino! | 엘든 링이라는 게임 말이죠. 제가 이 게임을 하면서 느낀 건, 이건 그냥 게임이 아니라 제 삶 그 자체라는 겁니다. 야구하면서 힘들었던 시절이 떠오르더라고요. 트리가드라는 첫 보스를 보자마자, 이거야말로 저를 시험하는 신의 장난 같았어요. 처음에는 딱 보자마자 “아, 이 정도는 껌이지”라고 생각했죠. 그런데 아니더라고요. 던지자마자 맞고, 굴렀는데도 맞고, 그러다 결국 다섯 시간을 죽도록 싸우고 나서야 겨우 이겼습니다. 그때 느낀 감정이 뭐였냐면요. “아, 이건 그냥 내 영혼이 싸운 거다.”

야구로 따지면 2회에 갑작스럽게 마운드에 올라가서 볼넷 던지고 나서, 코치님이 올라와서 “긴장하지 마라, 편하게 던져라”라고 했던 순간이 떠올랐어요. 그때처럼, 이 게임도 포기하지 않고 계속 던지다 보니 공이 포수 글러브에 쏙쏙 들어가듯, 보스의 패턴이 보이기 시작하더라고요. 결국 직구처럼 강하게 한 방 날리고, 트리가드를 쓰러뜨렸습니다. 이게 뭐랄까요, 그 짜릿함은 그냥 표현할 방법이 없습니다.

그리고 이 게임의 오픈월드는 말이죠, 제가 처음 미국으로 가서 야구장에서 길을 잃었던 그때를 떠올리게 했습니다. 길을 걷다 보면 갑자기 동굴이 나타나고, 그 안에는 무시무시한 보스가 기다리고 있어요. 그런데 그걸 깨고 나면 이상한 아이템이 나오고, 그게 또 나중에 엄청난 역할을 하더라고요. 야구로 따지면, 마이너리그에서 그 힘들었던 날들이 나중에 메이저리그에서 자신감을 주는 것과 같았어요. 그 과정 하나하나가 소중한 추억이 되고, 나를 단단하게 만들어주는 거죠.

스토리도 참 난해하더라고요. NPC들이 무슨 말을 하는데, 딱 제 영어 초창기 시절 생각났어요. 감독님한테 “Hey, how are you?” 한 마디 하려고도 얼마나 연습했는지 몰라요. 근데 그 어색한 대화 속에서, 오히려 진짜 나를 찾게 되는 느낌이 있었습니다. 이 게임도 마찬가지예요. 이 세상이 왜 이렇게 망가졌는지, 내가 왜 싸워야 하는지 고민하다 보면, “아, 이건 그냥 내 이야기구나” 싶더라고요.

결론적으로 엘든 링은 그냥 게임이 아닙니다. 이건 우리 삶 그 자체입니다. 어려운 상황에서 넘어지고 다시 일어서고, 그러면서 성장하는 그 과정이야말로 우리가 왜 도전하고, 왜 살아가는지를 보여주는 것 같아요. 제가 은퇴 후에도 팬들 덕분에 새로운 길을 걸을 수 있었던 것처럼, 이 게임도 플레이어에게 새로운 길을 열어주는 힘을 가진 것 같아요. | FYI- I finished the main game then I posted this review there is a lot of side content left

This is the most fun I ever had with a souls game its not super hard its not easy either... It took me 91 hours to beat the main story I did a lot of side stuff too.. I Think its a great entry point for someone who has never played a souls game before... This game guides you, humbles you and teaches you... The open world is beautiful and filled with Skyrim like dungeons with a boss waiting in the end.. I am gonna finish the side stuff now find awesome weapons and armour level them up and try different combinations  then i'll maybe get the expansion for the price its an amazing game YES! I would recommend it 9/10 | Если ты думаешь, что сегодняшний день тебя как-то подавил или морально размазал, то не беспокойся, Elden Ring даст понять, что сейчас он будет делать с тобой тоже самое, но еще и с задержкой, к которой привыкнуть достаточно сложно. Но всё преодолимо. Спасибо, Бабадзаки, что добавил прыжки и рогатую клячу. Единственный босс, которого так и не удалось одолеть - гравитация.

You step into this gorgeous world, thinking, ""This looks like a chill spot for a picnic,"" only to realize the picnic's actually your wake.

The graphics? Chef's kiss. It's like you're inside a Van Gogh painting, but every stroke wants to off you. The landscapes are so stunning, you'll forget to breathe – until you fall off a cliff.

Combat in Elden Ring isn't about skill; it's about how many times you can bash your head against a wall before you get it right. Every boss fight feels like they've got a personal beef with you. They're just there to mock your sad attempts at living. (git gud)

The lore? Man, it's deep. So deep you'd need a submarine to get to the bottom of it. And just when you think you've got it, some NPC comes along with a backstory that could be its own book. Good luck figuring out the story; it's like doing a puzzle blindfolded.

But here's the thing: despite all the pain, the frustration, the ""I'm uninstalling this"" moments, you can't help but love it. There's something about Elden Ring that pulls you back, like a moth to a flame, or a player to their doom.

Final Verdict: 10/10 - Would die over and over again. Elden Ring isn't just a game; it's a way of life. A life of pain, beauty, and the occasional scream into the abyss. If you want something that'll test your patience, your skill, and your swear-word collection, this is it."

Один из самых интереснейших рогаликов, в которые я играл. Здесь прекрасно всё: сюжет, механики, визуальная составляющая и саундтрек, но обо всём по порядку.

[h3]Сюжет[/h3]
Сюжет — по моему мнению, первый козырь игры, который цепляет сходу.
Прежний мир уже не вернуть, но мы помним — помним его части и по пути вспоминаем остальные локации и существ, в том числе и тех, кого мы не очень хотели видеть на дороге. Это завораживает и заставляет играть дальше, узнать мотивацию антагонистов и прочувствовать ощущения главного героя, его скорбь и груз его ответственности. Герой сам не помнит кто он такой, из-за чего и вытекает возможность смены класса. Мы не знаем его увлечений, но чувствуем в его словах... Надежду? Воодушевление? Не знаю.
Я прочёл все описания предметов, карточек и врагов, и могу сказать то, что тут всё продумано. Советую почитать на досуге, ведь это углубляет в мир игры. А ещё там написано всё от лица главного героя, что добавляет интереса к чтению.
[b]10/10[/b]

[h3]Механики[/h3]
Вам никто ничего не объясняет, вы всё должны пробовать на свой страх и риск. Нигде не напишут что за 10 гор/холмов вы резко вспомните ещё и о существовании гоблинов, или же о том, что вампиры не против полакомиться жителями деревни. Это увлекает и забавляет, а также в этот момент вы строите в голове сотни комбинаций с другими картами, которые вы можете применить в своем забеге.
Но комбинаций не очень много, и вы быстро их запомните, а также (по моему мнению) не хватает счётчика ландшафтных карт.
[b]9/10[/b]

[h3]Графика[/h3]
Я люблю пиксель-арты, и здесь всё идеально. Нет ярких цветов, что подобает мрачному сюжету. Очень понравились арты снаряжения и, особенно, боссов, что делает их незабываемыми врагами и примером отличного и продуманного врага. За всю игру мы увидим 2 кат-сцены и они шедевральны. Я даже поделился ими с друзьями, настолько мне они понравились, настолько в них влили душу.
[b]10/10[/b]

[h3]Саундтрек[/h3]
Очень понравился саундтрек в лагере, в первой кат-сцене и в титрах [spoiler]и в босс-файте с Омегой[/spoiler]. Когда его слушаешь, в голове так и возникают образы смерти и неизбежного конца, что очень сильно погружает в атмосферу и без того мрачного сюжета. blinch (автор сего аудио-творения) постарался на славу.
В остальных случаях — музыка просто подходит под стиль игры: не особо затянута, без сильных битов, не запоминается, и ощущается заЦИКЛенной (ba-dum-tss).

[h3]Итог[/h3]
Мне очень понравился данный рогалик. После The Binding of Isaac и Enter the Gungeon почувствовал что-то новое и необычное. Советую поиграть в данный шедевр тем, кто либо знаком с рогаликами и ищет точку интереса, либо тем, кто обожает пиксели и читать.
У меня всё. Благодарю Four Quarters за данный инди-шедевр, а вас за прочтение данного обзора.
[h2]10/10[/h2] | 玩的差不多了后觉得这游戏挺可惜的，创意确实很亮眼，当年还被TGA提名过，但是呢制作组并没有深耕的打算导致游戏就像个半成品一样。
1：作为主打肉鸽的游戏可重复游玩性却不如人意，到后期基本上就是无聊的刷，这一点可以说是致命的
2：游戏的自由度太高，而在前期惩罚也太高导致初上手的挫败感很强，新手引导特别不过关
3：到后期输了没感觉，赢了也没感觉，唯一感受到的就是时间流逝
总结的说，制作组愿意深耕的话以上问题都有解决的办法，凭借这个创意说不定可以做出一款里程碑式的作品，可惜他们并不在意，不过话说回来打折后的价格性价比没得说，值得喜欢独立游戏的各位买一个体验一下
 | La verdad es que este juego lo llevo jugando desde que salio, sin embargo lo jugaba pirateado en vieja pc, en cuanto mejore con respecto a pc lo primero que compre fue este juego y no eh parado de jugarlo. | I'd give it a 7/10

I had a lot of fun playing this game on my steamdeck while traveling but I will 100% say this game feels kind of unfinished and poorly balanced. A lot of my enjoyment was derived from trying to figure out how to win on the harder difficulties with each character in spite of the poor balancing. 

It's definitely a neat concept that I havent seen done before and I enjoyed discovering neat combinations of tiles on the map like Village + Vampire Manor = Vampire Town. But I wish there was more of that. There should be dozens and dozens of combinations and interactions, but there's really not. It feels like there's content waiting to be implemented but it just never came. 

It's got some soft ""gambling"" elements in that you can end runs early to cash in your treasure or you can always go for another loop or attempt a boss in an all-or-nothing kind of way. It's fun but frustrating in a not so great way. | Fantastic game and gorgeous visuals, normally not a fan of grindy games, but this feels like you make genuine progress every time you play

 | Я полностью повторил историю древней Руси причем чисто случайно, каждый правитель был максимально историчен: у каждого было столько же детей сколько было в реальности, каждый правил примерно столько же сколько в реальности, даже события по типу регентства Ольги повторились.

Eu diria que a sua melhor definição seria: ""The Sims para homens"". Nele, você tem liberdade para jogar como quiser e criar seus próprios objetivos na rica história da idade média.  
A avaliação negativa é pelo óbvio: *o jogo não tem tradução para o português*. Isso acaba deixando tudo extremamente cansativo porque há muita, mas muita coisa para ler. Considerando também que possui um linguajar medieval, isso acaba complicando ainda mais. Jogar na própria língua nativa melhoraria a jogabilidade em 2000%.
Dito isso, em questão de gameplay acho que daria pra melhorar o sistema de Causus Belli. Ao meu ver, a conquista através das batalhas se dá de uma maneira extremamente lenta. Sei que a proposta do jogo é ser mais cadenciado em certo sentido, mas às vezes a lentidão do progresso não parece compatível com o pace de outras mecânicas do jogo. 
Conclusão: é um jogo bem interessante e que te prende muito, jogue disponibilizando pra si mesmo bastante tempo. Se estiver na promoção, compre às expansões, infelizmente esses jogos de estratégia continuam com políticas de preço abusivas e irrealistas.

It just feels smooth where it needs to be, sharp and responsive and I appreciate the aesthetic design throughout, not just because of the Japanese theme, but the overall tone of the artwork. Also arrows are effective which is nice to see in a TW game. 10/10 and then some with workshop mods. | Total War: Shogun 2 - это суровый мир самураев, династий и стратегических сражений, который сразу же захватил мое внимание. Эта игра не просто стратегия, это целая эпоха, в которой каждый выбор может изменить ход истории. 

Плюсы:
1. Сюжет игры, основанный на исторических событиях, позволяет взять на себя роль одного из кланов и вести его к власти. Это не просто борьба за территорию, но и глубокая стратегическая игра, где нужно учитывать политические интриги, дипломатические отношения и экономическое развитие. Каждый выбор имеет значение, и это придает игре особую глубину.
2. Атмосфера Японии периода Сэнгоку передана с невероятной детализацией для игры 2011 года: от красивых пейзажей до неплохо проработанных юнитов, каждый элемент создает ощущение погружения в игру.
3. Музыкальное оформление заслуживает отдельного лайка! Звуки природы, традиционная японская музыка и эпические мелодии во время сражений создают уникальную атмосферу, которая усиливает погружение в игру.
4. Огромный плюс игры в том, что какую-никакую кампанию можно проходить с другом! Это очень круто, весело и дает больше разнообразия для совместных стратегических действий.

Минусы:
1. Иногда искусственный интеллект может показаться не совсем адекватным, а некоторые элементы управления слишком топорные и требуют времени на привыкание. 
2. В некоторых моментах игра может показаться медленной, особенно в начале, когда нужно развивать экономику и строить армию (на что уходит куча времени).

Total War: Shogun 2 - это великолепное сочетание стратегии и истории, которое оставляет после себя теплые эмоции и желание вернуться в этот удивительный мир.

其次在上强度之后，游戏会从模拟建设瞬间转化成微操资源管理，人力和资源的极致运用才能让你拿下胜利，你说肉鸽？什么肉鸽？哪有肉鸽？建设？哪有建设？

这不算充足的随机性除了能让你升血压并不能让你的体验得到提升，毕竟这个游戏所有的肉鸽收益基本都是有滞后性的，鲜少有立即生效却对你收益巨大的情况出现，游戏本身也是比起解决问题更倾向于让问题防患于未然，可以说基本都处于一种今日受苦而明日享福的循环，而人往往并不待见延迟满足，这也是城市建造类游戏的通病，随机性则让这一点被增幅了许多，毕竟脸黑一下的话你的精心布局很可能要到游戏尾声才得以找到key牌启动。

在真正上手游戏的中后期，本作特色的“肉鸽”“建设”属性可以说是基本等于没有（甚至肉鸽方面可能是负作用？），冲着这两点来的颇有几分受骗的味道。高强度下的资源匮乏和时间赛跑让游戏的建设属性约等于无，时间全花在拼尽全力管理有效利用资源上，而肉鸽属性正反馈不足，且低难度通解太多、高难度拿不到最优解血压又太高，负反馈很强导致肉鸽的设计很抽象。

相对的，游戏耐玩、结构与内容完整，微创新也不少，上手简单易懂，游戏内有明确的阶段性目标，能让城建玩的少的玩家不至于迷失方向不知道该做什么，每一局的目标不一样一定程度上保持了新鲜感都是值得肯定的优点。

总的来说是值得一个好评的，入手推荐史低，另DLC风评远不如本体，慎入。 | Against the Storm focuses on the best part of a city builder which is the first hours when you are in the building phase.  Against the Storm plays out differently every time because the buildings you start with are always different.   It is a well optimized game, with constant choices of risk vs reward, and enjoyable when you figure out work-arounds for meeting necessary resources, through supply chain management.

What I appreciate about Against the Storm is that there is never is a point where it gets too complicated with too much too deal with at one time.  The equivalent of the ""Boss battle"" is challenging and rewarding.  Graphic and sound design are excellent.

I've played over 650 hours and still not sick of it, so there must be something to this video game.  

Support these devs.  Eremite Games is a Polish developer consisting of six, and they really have created a real gem of a game, and they have been actively improving and polishing the game for more than a year after the day 1 release. | I genuinely started off liking Against the Storm, but the further you get into the difficulties the more tedious it gets, with additional negative modifiers and additional hoops to jump through to complete the session. Each seal completion really incentivizes you to play the next difficulty to get enough shards to complete the next seal to follow the metaplot, and lower difficulties may not get you the number of seals you need in time - additionally, the further out you go, the higher the minimum difficulty of the embarkment is, pushing the player to embark on those higher difficulty options. Why progress the seals other than metaplot? So you get more resources for the Citadel metaprogression. Which does things like add resources to your starting caravan so you can actually build some production buildings at the start, or adding a production building that let you make many key items - poorly, at high cost, but beneficial for the build chains so you are not fully reliant on RNG to get a building to complete the chain, or even adding bonuses to each race in your settlement like showing you where the first set of fields is where you can build a farm the first time you recruit a Human, so you don't have to spend half the session opening the wrong glades and never getting the constant food production that would provide. 

Except like many modern roguelite hybrids, this metaprogression is poorly balanced, and time consuming, which makes it feel like busywork rather than enjoyable on its own. It makes the higher difficulties less tedious to tackle (especially with some of the more helpful bonuses), but it just feels like an absolute chore to get through. Speaking of chores, they just add more chores without opening meaningful doors and mechanics past Veteran in terms of the difficulty options. The first three difficulties add mechanics each jump - after Veteran comes Viceroy, which is the same thing as Veteran with new forbidden and dangerous glade events to threaten your settlement and that the forest is more hostile by a multiplier of x3 instead of x2, but they don't do anything ""new"" really, they are just more of what you have seen before on earlier difficulties, and they just cost a ton of resources that you may not have been able to produce unless you have enough bonuses from the metaprogression tree and otherwise they apply so many negative benefits your game may actually end, such as the Stormbird which as far as I can tell by searching across the internet, people have been complaining is poorly balanced even with a good settlement for years. I don't just mean negatively either - the Stormbird applies an infinite storm effect, locking you to a year until you finish it (which you could delay), which is abusable in its own right if you were lucky enough to find it early. The Stormbird is just absurdly out of band in both directions and I cannot understand the intent of including it compared to every other event. I suppose that its very existence changes the logic pattern of whether you should open forbidden glades at all, but the higher difficulties disincentivize the opening of small glades due to hostility modifiers, so that just leaves dangerous glades if you do not want to starve but want to ensure a manageable event. What a forcible winnowing of the meta - it creates a very rote playstyle even though the apparent point of RNG building choice to create more unstable, dynamic push-and-pull gameplay. 

By the way, the tree also has a level attached - as you go through various sessions you get XP, when you level up you unlock new buildings and cornerstones (buffs) to show up in the game. THIS metaprogression mechanic is where the actual doors are opened for new build orders. Except its just as slow as the tree since its a blocker on the tree - without those later buildings and cornerstones, the game is not necessarily giving you the tools to win on higher difficulties. The amount of XP seems really low as well no matter the difficulty and even with completing various achievement challenges, which just exacerbates the issue.

I assume the decision not to bind those buildings and cornerstones to the higher difficulties and instead to a metaprogression level was so that you can use them on the lower difficulties and practice various build chains, but without overwhelming people when they start to play, and because of the complexity of creating a system that could both leave them default on the higher difficulties and then unlock them for use on the lower one once you cleared the higher one. Though perhaps they could have used their training missions for this. In all honesty the buildings beyond the first few levels matter less than the cornerstones, but they both add to how obnoxious the metaprogression system is - even if it is justified ludonarratively. 

In positives, I genuinely like the give and take between blight and production starting with the Veteran difficulty. I enjoy the season model and how each session naturally pushes you to modify your build chain on the fly or attempt to produce enough of your current resources to trade for the things you need to complete the Orders. I enjoy the fact that a session can take no more than one hour or maybe two at the higher speeds and therefore allows a bite-sized city building experience. I genuinely did get 30 hours out of it so I would say I got my money's worth, and I may play some more now and again, but anything that sufficiently annoys me more than it captivates me gets a negative review especially when the causes will not be immediately apparent to the player. | Let me preface this by saying that the game is very well made and I understand why so many people love it. I am not refunding it for any notable flaws.

For me specifically, when I play this type of game I want to dig in and work on one continuous settlement and make it grow over time, eventually getting to a point where I have this massive city that basically runs itself, giving me a primal sense of satisfaction that doesn't need to be felt again for roughly two years. But this game is a rogue-lite with some aspects of a mobile game, where you constantly restart a 'run', so to speak, unlocking stuff to make things more interesting for the next one. And though well-crafted, it's just not the kind of thing I'm looking for in a city-builder. | 与其说是城市营造或者基地建设，更像是有限资源管理游戏，不符合我的兴趣"

So, welcome back. If you're here you probably know about this game, if not, here's my attempt at being brief. cyberpunkdreams is a really neat and overwhelmingly fresh game that's flourished over the years of development.

I'm going to start this by saying I'm on the writing staff. So, yeah. I've been testing one version or another of this game off and on since 2016 through its alpha, beta, and now gamma. The testing I've done has been a lot longer than my working on things. So, understand. I know the flaws and where they are.

I've been able to get this much time (18623 as of the edit) out of the game: A) Because cyberpunkdreams is meant to be taken in over time, and B) Because there is a massive amount of content to dig through (and the game is continuing to grow). cyberpunkdreams is a text based game, so the quality of the gameplay is in its writing, the quantity of said writing, and the choices you can make throughout it. Be prepared to make choices. Lots of choices: about who you are, why you're here, and how you interact with the world. Who are you?

So, why are you here and what are you doing here? Well that's up to you, but most of us are here for a job. Whether that be an investigation or one last run in the core. You are for the most part a blank slate free to define yourself, having had your past scrubbed out of you to avoid being tracked and caught. There are always indications of who you once were, but that's a question for later. You're here to do a job and the path to doing that job is where the bulk of the content lies.

So, what do you do in Cinci? For awhile you'll be scrounging around, learning the city, and engaging in various schemes to establish yourself. Given time though you'll start to engage in more and more lucrative trades and businesses, get your hands on higher quality equipment, and find better sources of income to successfully establish yourself. Challenge gangs, bring war to the streets.

As the game is named, this is a cyberpunk game, and as the creator puts it: back to basics. cyberpunkdreams is a game about criminal activity, the punk aspect and how it relates to the cyber. The suffering and heights that come from that, living with the consequences of how you act and relating to your circumstance. You probably won't have much of that cyber stuff for awhile, but if you persist you can start getting your hands on the tech needed to start having an impact.

It's up to you how you establish yourself, and the choices you make along the way define who your character is as a person. There are easy ways to make quick cash, and there are hard ways to make alot. How do you treat other people and interact with them? Are you a nice guy, the bastard who goes around breaking limbs, or somewhere inbetween? Most of us are somewhere inbetween. Go straight vigilante some day. It's fun. He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man.

Explore the world, learn about it, find stories within it. Meet its characters, build your resources, and develop an organisation of your own. Prepare for your mission, eventually you'll need to pick up the pieces and act on it. You need to make the right choices, and be ready at just the right time to make your impact.

And remember, there are characters. An important part of this game is the characters, their stories and how they react to your choices and behaviours. Build a crew but word to the wise, don't look to make all of them part of your crew, it will drive you crazy trying to cater to all of them in the long term.

Gameplay wise, well that's tough. This is a text based game built around choices, there are games resembling this but not of this level of complexity. Pick a storylet or branch, a card. Make a choice, see the impact and move forward. Fairly simple on the surface, but it's about building routines and growing as a character as you experience the writing.

World wise it's a well thought out depiction of the mid future, we're somewhere around the 2090s, and things feel like it. A combination of climate change, societal collapse, and wars have broken America. Without going into the state of the rest of the world. Corporations drove privatisation and have strode through what was once the territory of the government. Taking over where the local government has faltered. Corruption is rampant, and everything is for sale. Technology has advanced, the panopticon is nearing a reality, and hope is dim unless we start a fire.

So, about that cyber stuff. Technology is constantly moving forward, and the commodification of human advancement is a reality. Even basic knowledge and memory is mutable and implants are speeding this up with the development of spikes. This is particularly the subject of my content.

So, Implants Implants Implants. There are some and we've been promised more. The ability to upgrade the human body and the symbiotes you take in. More radical body mods and prosthesis. The ones that are there are worthwhile in my mind, though you'll need to be pretty established to start picking them up. Being bulletproof is always a worthwhile goal.

We're not at terminator levels yet, but that will happen for us if we want it and work for it. See you at the Harmont clinic.

I don't have much more to say. How would I rate this game? Not perfect, but nothing is and the beauty in something is not in its perfection it's in the imperfections. The ones you can appreciate anyway. I certainly recommend this game, though I will admit bias at this point. I've been here awhile. | Lovely little game, well written in general, and plenty of choices. I've really been enjoying my time with the game, and am looking forward to more over the years."

""Few Nights More"" is a hidden gem that has been a really enjoyable experience so far, even though I’ve only played for a few hours. What I liked the most is how much thought you need to put into designing your castle. Placing traps and assigning monsters to specific rooms adds a lot of strategy to the game. The monsters you unlock aren’t always the strongest, but they’re great for slowing down and weakening the enemies as they move through your castle. If you position and upgrade them properly, they can clear out weaker enemies, making the fight easier when the tougher ones arrive.

That said, the strongest enemies always find a way to push through to your chamber. They attack in groups and can be pretty overwhelming, especially since recovering HP as a Vampire Lord isn’t easy. You can regain some blood during combat, but the amount is limited, and healing between nights is minimal. This creates a constant tension—if you aren’t well-prepared or take too much damage in earlier fights, the next wave could be your last. Managing your skills and resources carefully is crucial to handle these high-pressure moments, and the game does a great job of keeping you on edge.

Even after just a few hours, I can tell this is a game I’ll want to come back to regularly. The satisfaction of seeing your defenses come together, experimenting with strategies, and watching your Vampire Lord grow stronger makes every run feel rewarding. It’s clear how much care went into crafting this game, from the strategic depth to the immersive Gothic atmosphere. ""Few Nights More"" is a solid choice for fans of strategy and roguelike games, and I’m looking forward to playing more and refining my approach in future runs.

[/table] | Tough to review this one as there's 95% of a great game here but the developers are no longer providing support. Basically they dropped the early access label and declared it complete despite it clearly needing work.

Here's some examples that need fixing:

The last update was Halloween so there's a number of Halloween reskin UI items and an event with a ""Halloween buff"" that doesn't seem to exist and the ""?"" next to doesn't provide a tool tip.
The build number on the main menu is a ""release candidate""
Effect icons on characters are missing art and often descriptions, e.g. voidborn
The invaders for the castle are indicated to come in different entrances, but you won't know the order or the speed that move at.
The UI is locked to a certain aspect ratio and doesn't resize, I think you're 1080p or bust as far as I can tell.
Lots of effects have ""every X"" nights but it isn't clear when they trigger.
Not always clear which effects last just for the battle and which persist permantely
On skill selection there's lots of ""effects"" that aren't explained. What does ""enfold"" do for example?
Coffin HP max and regen isn't present on the UI and I can't find out how you would find out.
During gameplay on cards it's not obvious what the impact of an effect is either.
For extended endgame you need to merge an orb but if it's not equipped in slot 1,2 or 3 it's not detected so you get a game over.

There's loads more but they should be fixable without too much effort. It's frustrating that this game is a couple of QoL/bug fix patches away from being a solid recommend but it doesn't look like it's happening. | I can't recommend this game. It feels very unfinished. Like every single idea was started and never finished. They just kept picking up and moving to the next thing. Nothing works quite right and there are still game breaking glitches. Despite what the devs believe this is still very much an early access game. 

There is some fun ideas. But there is more standard industry slog then anything else. It isn't a tactical Rougelike. That is a lie. It is a Casino Rougelite. Basically Auto-Pets with vampires.

Infinity mode is a straight up joke. Scaling is beyond funny. It is the absolute bare minimum, laziest thing I have ever seen in my life. Night 161 and my character has like 300 strength vs, 1.2 billion hp bosses. If you know, you know.

Story mode is meh. It gets repetitive and stale very quickly cus you start every run with a new idea. But due to rng constraints you end up running the same thing, cus you don't get the item you need, or the skill you need, or the trait you need. You get the same 5 things every time cus of the busted weight mechanic. And so every run is the same.... In a ""rougelight""... Mkay... Also 18-22 nights is kinda short. Like, just as your build comes together and you can start playing with things, the game ends.

Characters are hit and miss. A few of them are fairly ok. 1 of them is completely broken. And 1 of them is beyond trash. Progression system is pretty good. Again, some characters get absolutely robbed. These people DO NOT understand how numbers work.

Combat is pretty awful. Because of the scaling issue it is either too easy or literally impossible with no middle ground. Another game where you've won or lost the fight before it has even started. And it is just boring. It is just very boring. Every fight is the same. With very few exceptions. Some enemies will try to hit you more then others. One has a  silence. 2 have DOTS, 1 is literally unkillable for 3 turns unless you have a certain trinket... But with how anti-fun the game is... I'm pretty sure that is a bug and not intentional. 

Idk. I wanted to like this game. It got some initial goodwill from me cus of the dodge and crit numbers being completely unmolested. But like. It clearly isn't where it needs to be and the devs are already moving on. So I think you should too. Pass. | « Entrez ici de votre plein gré et laissez-y un peu de la joie que vous y apportez. »

Few Nights More est roguelite de  défense de base au tour par tour qui ressemble beaucoup à un jeu de plateau aussi bien dans sa présentation que dans ses mécaniques de jeu.

On y incarne dans un monde médiéval fantastique le chef d’un clan de vampires qui tente de faire un comeback en même temps que le reste de son espèce. Evidemment les soi-disant forces du bien ne l’entendent pas de cette oreille et tentent donc de vous déloger de l’un de vos anciens châteaux vous servant de base d’opérations.  C’est donc un scénario simple et sans carabistouilles, ce qui n’empêche le jeu de nous servir quelques miettes de lore dans des descriptions d’objets ou de personnages.

Le but du jeu est de tenir 18 nuits et comme vous vous en doutez c’est bien plus facile à dire qu’à faire. Autant commencer par choisir son clan ; après tout il y en a huit en tout et chacun possède des forces, des faiblesses et un style de jeu très différent des autres : entre celui qui mange ses ennemis, celui qui se téléporte pour lancer des trous noirs à bout portant ou encore celui qui est une armure vivante incapable de se soigner, vous en trouverez forcément un à votre gout.
Il vous faut ensuite choisir une école de magie vampire parmi quatre. Chacune a évidemment des mécaniques de jeu différentes et vous permet de sélectionner vos deux techniques de combat de bas mais également les compétences que vous pourrez éventuellement utiliser pendant votre run. Enfin il vous faudra déterminer dans quel château organiser votre défense, sachant que chacun a évidemment un plan et des particularités propres.

Une fois en jeu une nuit se déroule toujours de la même manière. Tout d’abord vous avez une phase de préparation où vous pouvez placer librement votre personnage ainsi que des pièges et des monstres dans les différentes salles à votre disposition. Le but est d’éviter le décès de votre seigneur ou la destruction de son cercueil et c’est donc à vous d’anticiper la menace que vous souhaitez gérer en priorité en fonction des mouvements annoncés de vos ennemis ; vous vous doutez bien qu’un groupe de mercenaires déterminé à piller votre salle de bal constitue une menace moins pressante que celle d’un paladin décidé à vous administrer l’extrême-onction.

Ensuite vient la phase d’action et de combat où les groupes antagonistes pénètrent sur votre domaine. Les pièges et les monstres leur infligent des dégâts physiques et mentaux en priorité mais le combat s’engage dès que vous vous retrouvez dans la même pièce que vos envahisseurs. S’engage alors un affrontement au tour par tour relativement classique utilisant un système de points d’action mais aussi de recharge de compétences si une condition est remplie. Par exemple mon attaque de base coûtant 1 PA peut simplement retrouver deux de ses cinq utilisations au tour suivant, mais un buff gratuit peut avoir un temps de recharge de cinq tours. Rajoutez des reliques aux pouvoirs actifs et vous aurez de quoi jongler avec de nombreuses possibilités pour mettre au point des combos dévastateurs dont vous aurez bien besoin.

Une fois tous les combats d’une nuit remportés, c’est l’heure du loot ! Il va falloir alors gérer les éventuels gains de caractéristiques bruts, les plans de pièces ayant leurs propres passifs sur trois niveaux d’améliorations, les éléments de décors apportant d’AUTRES passifs, les gains de compétences améliorables, les  événements aléatoires, la répartition de points de réputations qui vous donnent ENCORE D’AUTRES passifs… cela peut paraître beaucoup mais c’est en réalité très digeste et cela contribue bien à nous faire ressentir à quel point notre seigneur de la nuit devient digne de titre. Sans compter que c’est très gratifiant de voir son château prendre des couleurs au fur et à mesure qu’on l’aménage puis qu’on le meuble.

Bref, bis repetita jusqu’à ce que notre mort ou la fin de la 18e nuit survienne.

On ne va pas se mentir : la difficulté monte vite (sans être injuste car la part d’aléatoire est bien moindre que dans un Darkest Dungeon par exemple) et une run complète dure un peu moins de deux heures, ce qui risque de mettre vos nerfs à rude épreuve. Du coup les développeurs ont fait en sorte que les récompenses de fin de partie soient particulièrement copieuses : avec les points gagnés par vos performances vous pouvez améliorer énormément de choses, de votre clan à votre école de vampirisme en passant par le château lui-même. Encore une fois il y a de quoi faire et vous aurez besoin de tout ça si vous voulez vous attaquer aux niveaux de difficulté supérieurs ou au mode infini.

Que dire d’autre sinon que l’enrobage musical et les bruitages sont curieusement quasi-inexistants alors que les environnements sont jolis (dans un style jeu de plateau) et que le chara-design dark fantasy est bien léché. Comme vous l’aurez compris il est néanmoins très copieux et plaisant à jouer, si bien qu’aucune partie de ressemblera vraiment à une autre. Il vaut largement ses presque 15 euros selon moi.

I really enjoy the ""bullet-heaven"" style mechanic of auto shooting once you get in range. Since most of the weapons are projectile based and not hit-scan, the enemies may be able to dodge the shots, so the platforming becomes very dynamic, dodging the enemies as you try and lock down your shots, as well as stomping on them once you get the chance.

I've encountered plenty of various synergies so far, there seem to be tons of different modifiers, abilities and weapons. Although so far I've found relatively little in terms of player choice in regards to the various power-ups (most of them randomly picked from chests and such), at no point did I feel underpowered or doomed, and it does have the upside of feeling quick and snappy, as usually, given too much choice, I fall into analysis paralysis which slows down the game too much. 
With that said, there are some ways to mitigate the randomness (seller/trader rooms,re-rolls etc).

The runs usually last I'd say between 10-30 minutes, with an option available to save the run and continue another time. The game is quickly becoming my go-to for when I have a few minutes to spare between things. Also Worth noting that it runs beautifully on the Steam Deck.

TL;DR
Absolutely fantastic game, a rare hidden gem which feels absolutely premium. | Squib goes boing boing | NB"
76561197976281073,1604030,V Rising,23.216666666666665,"Action, Adventure, Massively Multiplayer",4,"First thing, this game is very very addictive, I'd give you that. Once you start a game you will find it very very hard to stop playing. My 227 hours play time should be evidence enough to prove my point. But sadly, among my 227 play time, 99% of it was solo play. I would dearly like to join a clan and play with some other players. But alas, although the game does support clan play, some feature of the game or should I say lack of it, made it very unfriendly for clan play.  

The one thing I hate about this game is that all members within a clan shares everything. And in everything, I mean freaking EVERYTHING. All you can do is to trust in your clan member's ethics and hope they won't rob you blind when you're not in the game. Even the stuff in your so-call personal strongbox can be access by your clan members. So what good is a personal strongbox if everyone can get the stuff you stashed in it. I mean, why put in a personal strongbox in the first place is its utterly useless. At least put in some permission settings for the owner to restrict access to their stuff. 

Another thing is the loot system. I once cleared a tier 2 rift boss when another player came in and took all my loot dropped from the boss. The player was not even a clan member, just another solo player who came in and ninja looted all my stuff. 

All of this BS is making it very hard for anyone to form and invite people into a clan unless all the clan members are also real life friends. No one likes to be betrayed and rob of their hard earn possessions when they are not looking.

But, after mentioning all the bad stuff, I'm still gonna recommend this to others. The solo play is still worth playing. | 76小时全成就，已经被多人残酷模式狠狠地恶心到了。游戏虽然有诸多可圈可点的设计，但瑜不掩瑕，其槽点之多让人忍不住想要打个差评好好说道说道。

1.异常不合理的数值，多动症到离谱的boss以及仿佛断了腿一般的主角性能。玩家作为一个高贵的吸血鬼，也是人见狗嫌走到哪被打到哪，机动性比隔壁魂游的不死人都要差的多的多。平时顶着残疾人的移速跑图就已经无比折磨了，打boss时更是只能依靠cd10秒以上的闪现来躲避攻击，背板躲招式几乎是刚需。而对比鲜明的是boss各种位移闪现aoe，快到根本看不清抬手的大范围攻击以及一刀砍一半血的离谱伤害技能比比皆是：制作组对boss的理解显然还停留在力大砖飞上，所谓的残酷模式就是闭着眼睛填数值，甚至多人打boss的体验远不如单人来的舒适，不仅boss的血量会超级加倍，满场不间断召唤的小怪和额外招式也是恶心至极。

2.后期极度枯燥乏味的物资刷取，以及重复度高达100%的科技树系统。整个游戏前中期还算有些新鲜感，但默认设置的合成材料倍率以及制造时间简直让人不知所谓：造一块铁就需要好几分钟，而建筑和武器又需要消耗大量各种不同的物资，导致时间都花在了反复刷取材料等待合成上面。每进入下一个科技阶段，材料其实只是换了个名字以及更加麻烦的获取方式，甚至还得手动去翻箱倒柜的刷取一些进阶材料，才能获得批量制造的许可。如此无聊的重复作业，以及套娃一般合成配方一直持续到了通关为止。此外，游戏后期还有许多明显只是为了拉长游戏时间的恶心设计，例如武器碎片、宝珠随机词条的刷取，还有限时的大地图关卡，每次只能刷取少的可怜的暗影碎片，用量却又多的吓人。

3.为了所谓的pvp平衡性而牺牲的pve体验。这一点是最让人无法理解，游戏内看似有多个法术体系和流派，还有多种武器装备，按理说应该能够支持自由度非常高的bd系统，但制作组侧重pvp的莫名自信让几乎绝大部分的法术都变成了换皮的垃圾，boss无脑免疫控制更是让部分法术显得有些小丑。相似的模板换个颜色改一改词条，就又是一个新法术了；只能装备两个法术的底层逻辑让构筑毫无自由可言，更加不存在什么所谓的法术之间的combo，数值给的也是无比保守，简直是生怕玩家打怪打爽了。

4.不合理的奖励解锁顺序。这游戏的法术是按照等级123的顺序来解锁的，打赢特定的boss可以给一个指定等级的技能点，而每个等级的法术又有好几个——制作组看似贴心地让你有选择优先解锁的权利，但实际上后解锁的技能本就是被玩家淘汰下来的，装备栏又只有两个，导致后解锁的技能点处在一个食之无味，弃之可惜的尴尬境地，塞进boss奖励里多少有些敷衍。此外，游戏的装备分为了不同流派，而高级的衣服也是需要打boss解锁的。策划的大智慧就体现在，他们非常贴心地给你安排了一个线性的解锁顺序，保证你在当前阶段只能先穿着没有任何词条的白板衣服去打boss，然后依次解锁制造台、制造材料1、制造材料2...直到你打完了前面所有的boss，都快要通关这个章节了，你才能做出一套完整的衣服。而这套衣服还没有焐热，当你们打完章节头目后，恭喜你——新的上位白板衣服又出现了，快拿着它去挑战下一章的新boss吧。

...其实还有不少零零散散的槽点，一时半会也想不起来/懒得写了，那就先这样吧。这个游戏明明有不少的优点，但在诸多槽点的结合之下，我的游玩体验并不是很好。考虑到它并不是一个半成品，而是已经开发了多年的游戏，部分问题的出现更是让人难以理解...好消息是目前制作组貌似还在继续更新游戏，这一点确实值得肯定。只能说，希望它早日成为一个更加优秀的游戏吧。 | Bir oyunun grindi bile hiç sıkmaz mı?

This game was a fun throwback to those days. 10/10 would recommend. |    本人是从生死抉择中世纪（或者叫王国大战）过来的老玩家。目前对这一款正统续作也只是浅尝辄止。
   因此对深度游玩或者新玩家可能没什么帮助。但是，对喜欢王国大战的玩家会有用。
   首先就是在游玩侧重点上的区别。中世纪侧重点无疑是战斗，砍砍砍杀杀杀，好不痛快。什么基建仓储，物品管理都很轻描淡写，甚至是没有。主角完全是一人成军，一人成团，就是龙傲天，独自面对百万大军不在话下，后期的乐趣就是在郊区面对尸山血海感受自己的豪气万丈。然而提到血霾，但是截至目前本人所体验到的内容，血霾的进展比较缓慢，作战形式由主角个人换成了小队的形式，个人作战往往十分吃力，领地的开拓也比较缓慢，成长曲线没有像中世纪的那么线性但又富有爽点。（当然可能是因为不熟悉的缘故）
   然后就是画风。这一代变成了3D，表现力一般，属于这个价格的档次。但是讲真，见过了中世纪的独一无二（童年滤镜）的表现力，这一代便显得逊色。尽管中世纪是十余年前的游戏，画质早已落于时代，但是画面张力，主角的力量感，仍然可以让人血脉喷张。我现今仍然记得地震式飞跃在童年带给我的震撼，现在都是我最想学的几个游戏内招式。但是这一代目前尚未见到什么让人眼前一亮的，独具匠心的招式。而且打击感并不充足，很绵软，感觉没有什么挥刀加速度的人体吸收冲击的势能感。
   然后便是防御塔的区别。中世纪的区域规划包含的要素很简单：塔楼，矿井，酒馆。这一代也很简单：驱散器，塔楼，营地。（或许有所遗漏，但是第二个基地暂未见到产出塔楼材料类似的造物。）在这一方面，塔楼的变化很大，富有各自特色的三大武器化成了线性升级的机枪塔。但是一个基地（区域）可以不止有一个塔楼。然后塔楼的开拓区域的功能分散到了主角小队手里。并且因为威胁值的取消，塔楼的主要作用成了防御波次攻击而非镇压威胁。创新肯定是好的，但是过度削减内容深度的创新并不是很受欢迎。
  之后便是主角的个人能力分散到了不同的单位和npc身上。主角不再是工程师兼狂战士兼科学家了。因此这一代将侧重点从战斗爽换成了仓储管理。（个人认为）
  尽管如此，别的不说，这一代的枪支什么的，爽。毕竟中世纪不可能有什么先进的热武器。这一代做的不错，但是弹药有限，跟上一代不同，对于割草玩家而言想必是个缺点。
  但却不失为一款佳作。驱散器什么的确实是让人眼前一亮的设定。然后就是故事和世界观的更新，中世纪的剧情和世界观什么的确实很难比得上这一作。然后游戏还在更新，未来可期。
  本人买下这一代就算对中世纪的赞赏吧！期待工作室做出更多的经典。
  最后吐槽一下，感觉开始菜单界面的主角身体比例好奇怪，从中世纪的硬汉变成了浩克（
  至此便是本人能想到的内容。不知为何，理应游玩通关再写下评测的我突然心血来潮。游玩时间定然式不足的，因此评测肯定存在不少纰漏。除此之外，藉由个人游玩风格的不同，游戏侧重点便不一样。在此欢迎指出问题。"

76561197976281073,1741640,Shadows of Forbidden Gods,15.333333333333334,"Simulation, Strategy",1,"What a unique game! Very immersive and actually has very rich mechanics that interact with each other, creating cool emergent gameplay as you influence characters in the world and then watch how they turn against each other and the world slowly descends into chaos | It's good.

There are not a lot of games that focus on indirect control as the core mechanic, and SoFG is probably the best one out of all of them. All the things you'd expect to be wrong with a game of this scope to budget ratio are there, from crunky UI to unevenly available information to arcane sub-sub-subsystems that might decide the outcome of your game if you haven't seen them before, to very uneven feel of quality between different playable elder gods...

But then if you're looking at this title, chances are at least some of the opacity, abundant complexity and plentiful soft failure states are actually a draw rather than a drawback for you.

The game has a number of subsystems that interact with each other. Plagues cause death, death can be used to spawn ghasts, which will enshadow the countryside, enshadowed locations corrupt their rulers and heroes with more shadow, at which point they will start ignoring the spreading plague.

However, the game is also full of heroes and rulers who will by default fairly easily undo anything you put into place. The key to winning the game is often two-fold - picking a core strategy early (which means learning enough about what they all are, which will take a while), and running distraction tactics until your core strategy completes.

You have a number of agents and evil god powers that are all able to make the world a little bit worse, but none of them will be enough to win the game on their own. Instead, the game essentially is about building out a self-growing engine of corruption and decay into the game world's independent systems.

Assassinate a ruler? A heir will take his place. Instead, steal a personal belonging of theirs and use it to engineer a scandal in a neighbouring kingdom, making war between them that much more likely.

Drive a local town into madness? The clerics and heroes will soon fix it. Instead, mask and hide the growing abyssal fish-people cult until it begins spilling over into new towns and you can curse entire family bloodlines.

Amass an orcish army and break the human kingdoms into dust? There's more of them and they will destroy you armies once they become notorious enough. Unless of course you have a secondary orcish horde ready to take over the now-abandoned lands of their slain brethren - and those of the razed human kingdoms, too.

Try to remove a ward against shadow a religious movement placed? They will place hundreds more. Instead, manipulate signs of prophecy to place your own minion as their prophet, and slowly turn the religion into one that spreads shadow for you instead.

The game has a stupid amount of options and eventually it makes it really fun to engage with the game, being able to pick from your vast array of tools to sculpt just the outcome you want. Until that happens, you're kind of stuck picking things up to try them out and learning that hey actually they don't do very much on their own at all, and that the process for finding out why they failed or what they even do is pretty obtuse. But, you know. Some days all that feels like a plus. Maybe today's that day for you? | This is a very good strategy game - buy it.  It  could use some better tutorials and the UI is wacky.  However, once  you get a grip on how the game play works, it is a lot of fun to watch the good folk crumble to your long simmering plans.  Also, each of the  evil gods play very differently and this offers a lot of replay.  One thing that could use improvement is the magic /special actions systems where it is way too time consuming to mess with compared to just enshadowing. everything  (with the possible exception of death magic ghosts).  Anyway, this is is worth full price. | This is the roughest game I have ever enjoyed.

As people have warned, the UI is terrible. It does slow the game down, raise the learning curve, and make figuring things out a chore. The nicest thing I can say about how the game looks is that it manages to not clash too much, despite being somewhat cobbled together from limited art-assets and public domain-images. 

But as a grand-strategy game, the game still manages to work, and deliver on it's theme. If you bite down, there is much, much here to chew on, and the planning and strategizing of your moves is very rewarding. The writing and aesthetics could be better, but the game delivers just enough lore and fluff with it's mechanics, for most of the themes to land. 

Everything around the core gameplay in this game could use some work, but what's here is a functional, strong idea in a genre that rarely gets good games. | Если вашей душе захотелось чего-то более нестандартного в плане пошаговых стратегий, то как-то раз я наткнулся на... это.

Прежде отмечу что да, графика тут по сравнению с прочими коллегами по жанру полное днище, даже по весьма непритязательным меркам. Но, мы же в инди не за этим идём, правильно?

А игре есть что предложить, потому что... В двух словах её геймплей уже успели довольно ёмко охарактеризовать в другом обзоре: ""Представьте, что вы играете за Ктулху, в то время как остальной мир вокруг вас играет в Crusaders Kings""

И это действительно так. Только играете вы скорее не за самого Великого Древнего, а за условную группу его приспешников, которые пытаются своего покровителя призвать в дженериковый фэнтезийный мир с людьми, гномами, эльфами и прочими орками.

Начинаете вы одиноким сектантом в капюшоне, который должен пробраться в ближайшую деревеньку и начать там распространять веру в своего темного повелителя. А делать это нужно затем, чтобы потом было проще разносить свой фхтанг уже дальше - в города и столицы королевств, постепенно становясь все более заметным и могущественным. При этом вы медленно распространяете порчу, которая называется здесь ""тенями"" (shadows), нанимаете новых агентов, творите различную магию... Ну а мир вокруг вас до поры до времени просто живёт: кто-то на кого-то нападает, соседи заключают и нарушают договоры, герои - геройствуют.

К слову о последних. Вы же не думаете, что они вас будут все время игнорировать? Рано или поздно ваши козни станут слишком заметны на мировом фоне и здешний Избранный начнет как в заправской RPG собирать под свои знамёна армии и убеждать правителей в том что вы не просто наркоман, балующийся зельями, а опасный культист, стремящийся захватить мир.

Но произойдет это не сразу, потому что, как я уже говорил, пока вам нужно наращивать свою мощь, в том числе за счёт новых агентов. А они бывают двух категорий: стандартные и, скажем так, уникальные. Из первых можно лепить что вам вздумается, а вот вторые обычно имеют собственные портреты и уникальные навыки, недоступные прочим. Тут все как на подбор: падший аристократ, дикарь, безумный шаман племени орков... двенадцать колоритных личностей. Ну и вместо полноценной графики у них тут портреты с закосом под эпоху Возрождения. А ещё вы можете совратить одного из уже существующих героев, чтобы он встал на вашу сторону. Ну или банально свести с ума - одной проблемой меньше, так или иначе.

Всех агентов можно отправлять на различные задания, которые включают в себя как обычную инфильтрацию в сообщество крестьян Малой Кукевки, так и более сложные вещи наподобие изучения магии, исследования вон тех древних руин или сражений с войсками ""нормисов"".

Да, тут есть простенькая боевая система, напоминающая весьма упрощенные Discilples: по ходу игры вы можете нанимать для своих агентов различных бойцов, которые будут защищать их как от назойливых приключенцев, так и солдат местного лорда, которому вы чем-то не угодили. Особых тактических изысков не ждите, игра всё-таки не про это.

А вот кому угождать нужно, так это вашему темному божеству, поскольку нужно успеть захватить мир до того как истечет определенное количество ходов. Ну а ваш покровитель, в свою очередь, предоставляет вам свои, зачастую уникальные способы по достижению своей цели. Непосредственная помощь, как правило, представлена в виде различных заклинаний, которые вы можете использовать на общей карте. Причем, чем больше вы распространяете порчу и чем больше проходит времени, тем сильнее становится божество и под конец его аватар даже может самолично выйти против зарвавшихся смертных.

Впрочем, на вашу долю тоже выпадают определенные события, которые представлены в виде простеньких текстовых квестов. Хоть они и часто повторяются, но вносят свою небольшую лепту в разнообразие геймплея.

И вот таким образом вы постоянно отправляете кого-то на задания, сражаетесь с врагами, изучаете новое заклинание, что приводит к небезызвестному синдрому ""ещё одного хода"", когда оторваться до самого конца партии ну очень сложно.

Ну а для тех, кому захочется добавки существует целое DLC ""The Horrors Beneath"" которое вводит целый дополнительный слой карты - Подземье и связанный с ним контент, включая новое божество, дремлющее в недрах планеты. Впрочем и восьми Древних в оригинальной версии хватит надолго. А ещё игра официально поддерживает моды и там тоже можно найти что-то себе под стать.

Однако, к сожалению, не каждый сможет продраться сквозь перегруженный интерфейс и малоинформативное обучение. Да и перевода у игры тоже нет, к сожалению. Но если у вас получится пройти сквозь все дебри, то поздравляю - вы сможете вдоволь порадовать внутреннего злодея."

It’s so zoomed out, that it’s really just a math and spatial puzzle. The theme really doesn’t come through much at all. It’s all about optimizing your position on the board but there’s no asymmetry or theme beyond what terrain a space is.

Nothing about it sounded fun. But then I watched a video of someone playing it on YouTube and thought it looked much more fun than the promotional videos had shown. So I gave it a try and OMG, I totally enjoyed this game. It has no right to be as fun as it is. I tend to be a completionist and this game helped scratch that itch. The best part is that I'm a huge fan of Castlevania so that DLC was just the greatest thing I never knew I needed. Seriously, for me the Castlevania DLC made the game at least 10x more fun.

My only complaint would be it's kind of a one and done for me. Once everything is collected I don't feel a need to play it. Loved playing it that first time around though, collecting all the things, unlocking all the stuff, it was fantastic. I'd have to do a complete fresh install to relock everything to make unlocking it again enjoyable. But still, it was the best 190+ hours of my recent gaming life :D | A lot of people like it but I honestly found it kind of boring.

A good number of hours out of it, especially for the price point. There's a lot of characters, different weapons, evolutions, secrets, stages etc. Sometimes things get so ridiculous that you can't even see what's going on anymore, but it's all part of the charm of the game.

I don't really have any critiques, because it does what it sets out to very well. I will say though that the game is considerably easier than I expected it was going to be going in. | Literalmente el juego del vicio a su máximo esplendor, el trailer habla por si solo, vas a dejar tu vida jugando a este juego para conseguir todos los desbloqueables y probar todas las combinaciones o personajes posibles.

El contenido que obtienes de juego por lo que pagas es totalmente justo, ya poseo todos los DLC hasta la fecha y realmente cada uno suma una cantidad de contenido absurdo que da para aun mas horas de juego.

Además, como fan de la saga Castlevania es muy divertido ir notando cada una de las referencias que guarda este juego y cuando añadieron el DLC de Castlevania, literalmente explote.
 | This game has the best ratio between the amount of fun you'll have with the fewest amount of buttons. I've never played anything this deep with literally just WSAD and Space. Also, 5€ full price for this? What a bargain. I get that it's a simple game, but come on. Give yourselves some credit, devs. And thanks for the full ultrawide support, although I would prefer a third option to solid and transparent black bars, which would be no black bars, but that's a massive nitpick.

EDIT: Ooooooh! That's how they make money! They have DLCs, so the whole game is actually 20€ if you want everything. That makes way more sense. Still too cheap though, because from what I've tried from the DLCs so far, they are very good and definitely worth the asking price."

There is an 'island soul' that has a less than 1% chance to drop from a pouch that has a less than 1% chance to drop from a mob. I don't know what the math on that works out to exactly, but googling says in the thousands of hours.

Gear 'honing' has abysmal success rates and you lose materials on every attempt. The honing materials are tiered and each level requires a different material so all your old mats are virtually worthless when you move up a tier. Drop rates for 'collection' items are extremely low and many mobs, bosses, events, and/or islands only spawn once or twice a day/week, so collection can take hundreds of hours for a single item.

Every system in the game is designed to take as much time as possible, every single day, unless you pay. Even if you pay, the time gates and drop rates stay the same, so you still have to grind. Beyond the currency bloat, there are also 4+ XP systems you need to grind.

I stopped eventually because of the sheer grindiness and utterly ridiculous currency and loot box mechanics. I came back recently because I heard some of the newer updates reduced the grind and simplified the currency. I thought I'd take a look and see whether it was worth coming back to.

I should not have. The grind is all still there and, if anything, is worse. The currency has been simplified a bit but it is still ridiculous. There is still silver, gold, crystals, royal crystals, pirate coins, open seas coins, pheons, shards, fragments, and probably others that I've just forgotten. There are six different 'profession' currencies that you have to collect and each of them has multi tiered rarities. You can convert between all of these at awful (like 10 to 1) exchange rates. There are sinks for all of them everywhere.

Despite simplifying some things, they've added whole new systems to make things even more grindy and confusing. These systems have new fetch and farm quests and use different materials that you need to use that have low drop and conversion rates. It's just more of the same.

Trying to play content from before the endgame is hit or miss because people are simply not there and the content is not accessible by just one person. You can ask in chat and you might get lucky, but there is very little incentive for an end-game character to help out with content that they probably haven't touched in years. There is a 'solo' mode option for some pre-endgame content, which can be useful, but it's a little laughable having a 'solo' mode anything in an MMO.

I could try to find a guild and try out discord to get some older, wider content done, but that doesn't solve the grind and loot box issues this game has. I don't mind grinding for an item, but grinding for just a chance at an item is a special level of hell.

There are some nice people still playing and you might be able to connect with them in game or over discord and get some things done if you are new or returning, but if you value your time, money, and sanity, don't. Pick another MMO. | Quiero aclarar que el juego en si es muy bueno, el problema es que no recomendaría este juego a un jugador nuevo, ya que solo puedes jugar a este juego y disfrutarlo siendo nuevo jugador si tienes amigos que ya jueguen de antes y tengan personajes muy avanzados. Los jugadores nuevos son muy fácilmente identificables, siendo muy difícil que te inviten a grupos para poder realizar el contenido final del juego. Por otro lado, es un juego extremadamente exigente respecto a las horas necesarias dedicadas al día, por lo tanto, es necesaria una inversión de horas extremadamente elevada para que puedas jugar de manera autónoma, pudiendo ser frustrante para muchos jugadores nuevos. | This game suffers a major struggle as one that is developed by a Korean development company and published by an American company who pushes the game updates from KR to the western version of the game. The publisher has no power or will to transform the new (or current) player experience in a meaningful, permanent way that will help them ascend to the relative power levels of veteran players.

One of the best examples: Gearing a character in this game requires collections of 'cards' for card sets which are a huge component of damage or support power for players. As such, it requires too much time commitment and/or money for new players to get to a point where they are comfortably playing endgame content with veteran players or normal consistent raid lobbies at all due to this huge missing chunk of damage or support power.

Due to the nature of raid leaders being able to inspect the full range of gear for applicants to raid lobbies, many players will be rejected because of their lack in raid power. Due to the difficulty and dps checks of some raids, the lower power players will have a hard time clearing raid content with each other at all even if they do make their own lobbies.

The developers did make content called 'solo raids' which can be completed for some of the relevant gear materials, but due to the content release schedule of the game, players are never quite able to catch up because their rate of growth is too slow.

By the time a newer player is ready to play a newer raid, most of the population will have moved on to a newer raid, and a fresh player will not have an easy time finding a raid group in the Lobby Finder that will help them learn an older raid. The older raids are referred to as 'homework', and players are often expected to already have played and farmed the raid enough by that time, so as not to hold back the players who want to complete this 'homework' raid for their needed gold.

Speaking of gold, the Western version of the game is suffering from very high economic inflation due to the rampant and seemingly unstoppable plague of gold farming bots. Korea doesn't suffer from this issue because their game client requires a Korean SSN to verify identity. Steam has no such requirements, so bot accounts can be made in mass volumes to this day.
It's against the terms of service for players to purchase gold from these bots, but they continue to do so and purchase (from the Auction House) either large volumes of honing materials or high value gear which also happens to be in high demand from the general population.

Lost Ark at its core was such a cool game and I'm happy to have played it since launch, but as of Feb2025 it's not hard to see that this game's publisher (Amazon Game Studios) and/or developers (Smilegate) continue to betray its audience at large by not acknowledging core issues at all or addressing them in a timely manner.

There are other issues I'm sure I forgot to mention, but needless to say I can't recommend this game for any new or current players at this time. | i love the game, but management is  the worst you can get in MMO. 
IF you looking for developer or publisher communications, feedback review and improvements, addressing community needs and adapting to changing economy, meaningful monetization and much more, this is not a game for you to play!

さて、開発元のSokpopは、２０１７年から現在まで、かれこれ１００タイトルを超えるゲームをリリースして来ました。知りませんでした。それも翻訳が必要だと思う様なゲームには大体日本語が対応してますし、複雑で不便な日本語を忠実に再現出来ていて、このSokpopという方々は何者なんだと思いまして、ホームページを見に行きましたところ、メンバー最年長のtijmenさんがバク転してました。爽やかで結構。

そのゲームタイトルの中でも一番売れているというこのStacklandsは、見ての通りのカードゲームですが、食料の概念が有りまして、村人が増えれば出来る作業が増えるけれども、食料が足りなくなるので、食料生産の自動化をして、やってるうちに敵が攻めて来て、ハンマーやつるはしを剣と盾に持ち替えて、戦って、死んで、やったー食料が減らないから一人でいいや、何だっけこの宝箱、何だミミックか、よし全滅。というゲームです。

Sokpopは他のゲームもワンアイデアが盛り込まれたちょっとイイじゃんっていう物が多い様に見えます。ホームページにPatreon.c0mへのリンクがデカデカと掲載されていましたので、飛んでみましたところ、４０００人以上の会員様がいらっしゃってこれだけで約６０００ドル／月という支援を受けており、その資金を使って更に毎月新しいゲームを開発して会員やSteamユーザーはニコニコ、開発者はバク転しているという好循環を生み出しています。

Unfortunately my review is negative because I tend to gather many resources, and the game becomes unmanageable when this happens, partially because the board size is smaller than the necessary, partially because new resources are not smartly grouped (they can be initially, but not for the long run). and then you start to focus more on the board management than the actual gameplay. My feeling is that the mechanic right now should be a beta version, and the true game should still be better polished before a true release.

I however fall in the category that does really enjoy this game and I'm glad I bought it on steam.

For a game that's still in early access and that only has one developer I have been happily surprised by what this game achieves. You're dropped into an infinitely expanding world that gets more dangerous the further from the center you go, which is done one step at a time. You choose a character from a tribe of which each tribe has to different characters that do basically the same, and set out on your journey. 

The gameplay loop starts here. You move, enter an autobattle or get resources and move again. This is the game so far. The difficulty of the battle can be estimated beforehand, which is good. As a character that dies is permanently gone and you have to get a new one. I will state again, if this seems unenjoyable, think about buying this game. Or try it for free. There's a web version out there at the time I write this review.

All in all, I like the loop and the quest for ever better gear and the community is amazing in helping out with sharing information and just overall being very positive. I definitely recommend trying it out.

+ fun autobattler that goes at a pace you set yourself
+ different builds that are pretty distinct
+ amazingly fun community to interact with
+ pretty neat game for the price and amount of developers

- Characters could be more distinct within each tribe
- lots of balancing still to do at the time of writing (I trust this will be fixed)
- not for everyone, please look into this game before buying | The game is for those who enjoy progress for progress' sake.

There is no goal. This is a 5/5 Netflix supplement or work aid.
You have low level gear, you kill monsters til you find higher level gear.
You dismantle that higher level gear to learn how to craft it.
You farm resources and go craft higher level gear.
Now you can kill higher level monsters.
Repeat for ever.

If you die, you make a new character and lose your equipment but keep your inventory.
You die a lot. Get used to crafting yourself new gear. Always dismantle your highest found level equipment. | I dropped Lost Ark for this... 

You probably wonder why I made this statement. Well World Seed has all the things you would probably enjoy in all those f2p/mobile ""mmo"" games. Character progression to infinity, builds, random (kinda) gear drops. Some exploration. Co-op dungeons/bosses. But it actually is free to play on the web version, and it does not gate you with stamina refreshes, pay to get more powerfull gear/characters etc. You can play as much as you want, whenever you want.

You start from the center of the map, get some gear drops to increase your item level. Then you go out to the higher level areas, get higher level gear, and repeat. It is grindy. You will not reach the crazy hundrends of thousands dmg/item-level fast. And I must admit it might get repetive. Not sure, I still have lots of fun on my fourth area. Combat is automatic, your character(s) trade blows with the enemie(s) untill someone retreates or dies. There are some elemental effects you can have on your gear, but it is simple. Better numbers result in victory. If you die you lose your character, and whatever he is wearing. And start with a new one of your choice again. It is not that bad, early game at least, because you can get some materials and craft the gear pretty fast again. Unlesss you had some mats laying arround in your bank (you probably have). There are no character levels, everything is about gear. There are coop dungeons for special loot also, but you will probably spent most of the time exploring and grinding gear. 

This is all I have experienced so far, and allready loving the game. It will be my chill farming, rpg game. And it can be totally free if you want to, I chose to purchase it on steam to support the dev. Personally got tired of the time gating mechanics of the f2p model games, and their shenanigans to get me hooked. This game fits like a glove on that place of my steam library. And will gladly spent money on it again, as long as I play it.

Really looking forward to see where the development of World Seed will get it. | IGN: Neptune . this game is hands down amazing. progression is smooth and still has challenge. loot system is based off gear score and you have a storage to keep your items. you only lose whats equipped on death. for what i have played so far this game is just amazing. i suggest playing it for free in the browser then if you like it buy it on steam. | This is a great game that literally exposes everything wrong with the gaming industry! If you're not familiar with this game this whole game is developed by one guy and its absolutely amazing. Forewarning though if you're not familiar or a fan of Roguelike games you may or may not like this game since the combat animations are quite simple. Don't get me wrong the game looks great but it ain't no crysis 3 so don't judge the book by its cover. The true essence of this game lies in the endless possibilities, open worldness and the massive amount of customizations you can do towards your chars build. Also the items, stats and progression system make absolute sense and sad how one guy came up with such a balanced system that is very well polished. Plebs be warned this game is no roller coaster, from the very second you load into the world you're free to do whatever you want no tutorial included(there's tips that you can enable or disable but who's tryna read!) and the world is absolutely massive , if someone told me there's no end i'd believe them xD. But not only is there one super massive world there's several realms that correspond to the elements that are just as massive as the main world so be sure to pack plenty of trailmix. At the time of this review this game has been out for about a month now and i've seen this guy put out more content then plenty of games with huge dev teams and multi million dollar pubs... Games like this with independent devs just go to show that corporations have ruined the gaming industry and are more worried about monetizing everything about the game then actually making them fun. Meanwhile this guy makes a  masterpiece solo dolo and only charges 9 dollars for everyone to play. If you're tired of shiny piece of shit triple A games then come give this game a try, I promise it won't break your bank and you'll be support a dude that actually knows how to make a fun game!

P.S. There's a bunch of champions you can play in game but if he adds a char creator later on that would be an amazing addition besides that I can't complain about much."

However, the game leads you towards multiplayer; the problem with that statement being: if you get even a tiny bit of latency, you're disconnected from the game you spent many minutes working on, and it gives you NO way of coming back to the game you were disconnected from.

It was not.

10/10 | I saw this game for free, but didn't like that I had to link my Steam account to some other company, so I just decided to buy it instead. Games like this are why I wish Steam had a middle box between recommend yes and no. I'm just indifferent about it.

The main reason I would click no is actually my fault for not paying attention. The main reason I didn't like it is because it's not the kind of game I thought it was going to be when I bought it. I was thinking fun little 3D action/adventure/platformer game, bonus points if it kept me busy with lots of monsters to take care of while I progressed through a story. But it's more like a co-op arena game that would be better with a friend.

When I think about it in that context, would I recommend it? Probably. It is actually a fun, fast paced little shooter and I feel it's pretty well done. I've paid far more for far worse games than this. It did feel a little tedious to me but then again in fairness, I barely scratched the surface of it. There seems to be a lot more to unlock and deal with in it than I ever got to.

I feel like if you know what you're getting, it's not a bad game and you might have fun with it. Especially if you have someone to play it with. | it is pretty fun but as a running theme of Behaviour games its dead and hasnt had any patches in years"

You are drawn cards in every X seconds intervals and the time stops while you have your cards at hand, you have mana and you build or upgrade stuff (which will be always located in the middle of the screen) and wait until it's the time for the next draw interval. The game starts out as a roguelike deckbuilder, it has it's difficulty but it's neat, both the visual and audio design in the game are pretty decent, so Heretics Fork does a good job with most of the things it's doing, except for;

End-game.
Unfortunately I cannot say the same for the late game, it's still subjective but for my sake, I would like to keep the game the way it was, in the same genre, but it fleshes out to something different the more you progress in it's meta-progression:
Basically this game has a lot of card unlocks, and in the end it allows you to equip so many different kind of winning styles, except for; ""rng""
Sadly this doesn't pair well in Heretics Fork, because you are limited by only a few choices of card rewards in your entire pool, and mixed with you having way too many different card possibilities which sadly do not synergy with another, you are mostly left to the fate, essentially turning this into a casino roll, the fun and the creative aspect of the game dies with it and it becomes a ""side-screen"" game where you check and click based on the randomness time to time, and the most-time being spent on the ""waiting"" until next draw makes it even worse since your experience is no longer favored ""as much"" as it used to be, thanks to the crazy amount of unlocked card pool.

The game offers a lot of challenges, again, they are easier to do on low level and very difficult (rng, not actual difficulty) on late game.

It's still not a bad game per se since fun is subjective at it's best, but I wish it stayed the way it started out as, so do be warned before picking it up | Типичная фигня из серии вампайр сувайрс. Музычка прикольная, башни имба - гарнизоны сосут."

Не хватает динамики, хотя на промо материалах кажется что прям ВАУ! А на деле бесконечный неспешный гринд нейтралов. Убрать из этой игры вселенную вархаммера и получится... ZEPHON

За фуллп-прайс еще и со всеми ДЛС - ну такое себе удовольствие. | Каждая компьютерная игра существует только для того, что бы украсть твоё время — самый ценный ресурс, который есть у каждого человека. Вместо самореализации тратить своё драгоценное время на жизнь в вымышленных мирах, не имеющих к нашей жизни никакого отношения — это достойно звания «Человека». Подобно наркоману, гоняющимся за выработкой мозгом гормонов. Безусловно это внесёт несоизмеримый вклад в развитие научных направлений и самого человеческого вида. Поэтому да — это игра стоит того,  проебать своё время и выбросить на помойку свою жизнь, став пылью на дороге истории, по которой пройдут более достойные потомки человечества нежели ты. Подобно рабу, прикованному цепями к своему месту, ты привязан к событиям, миссиям, «достижениям», и стал придатком своего компьютера (большой палец вверх) | I recommend this solely cause it was free at the time I got it.

I like both, Warhammer and 4x games. However, the depth isnt there anywhere near the level I expect from a 4X game, while on the other hand, the action isnt as high paced, as I would want it from a Warhammer game.

Aside from that, its not terrible. Just not good either. Which sadly already puts it in the top 10% of Warhammer games I guess."

I really enjoyed the problem solving, and scenario planning aspect of the game.  It is a ton of fun to play, once you figure it out, and this is where this game falls down, in guiding new players.  

I would highly recommend new players to not shun character guides and other online resources to get going.  This is a ten year old game and I think they purposefully designed the game around ""discovery"" mechanics (especially around character skill progression and item effects) so you learn by doing,  Which I think would be fine if you unlocked something that documented the information for you so if you step away for a few weeks you don't forget.  I find myself wasting resources to ""find out"" what something does only to have forgotten even later in the play through. 

Personally I think if this game underwent a UX/UI cleanup, slightly better tutorialization of some of the mechanics and better information persistance you could re-release this game today and it would attract a huge following. | OK game. Would be awesome without the following two issues. First, the game occasionally CTDs between floors and deletes the autosave (the only allowed save) in the process - so game over. Secondly, large monster waves are a big blob of moving pixels. It is almost impossible to tell which monsters and how many are attacking your heroes. Looks ugly too. I do not get why people like pixel art in this game. Pixel art was not a choice but a necessity back in the day. The best old pixel art (e.g. Prince of Persia, Lemmings) also looked way better than this hot mess. | Addictive, good looking, funny, rogue type game that makes you utilize brain and try it in different play modes.

Cons - sometimes it is too dependent on random elements. | Не цікава, не весела, цілком порожня гра із високим порогом входження. Не рекомендую нікому. 2/10 (повернув би гроші, якби міг) | It's a good rogue-like style dungeon game, great to play with friends."

年近四十，上有老下有小的人是很难抽出整块时间坐在电脑前静静品味一个游戏，趁着这个春节，下定决心品尝这杯已经做好了多年的咖啡，于是力排众议顶住压力（感谢妻子的理解支持），在电脑前坐了一周indulging play，99小时40分通关了游戏，在深夜的屏幕前久久回味难以忘怀，震撼到无以复加，这注定是我人生难忘的精神之旅，也是我游戏编年史上最璀璨的坐标。

Larian在此呈现的，远非寻常意义上的电子游戏。
作为游戏，各种设计完美衔接，恰到好处；自由度高到令人发指，你可以做你自己；装备/等级/数据都是精心设计，兼顾了最大公约数；
作为音乐，Down by the river随河风飘扬成流动的叙事，I Want to Live在抉择时刻撕开灵魂，The Power见证胜利后紧握棱镜的双手，各类主题曲契合场景主题，已然挣脱媒介的桎梏，变成可以交互的交响诗，让我事后还反复专门聆听感慨；
作为剧本，这内容本身就是很精彩的小说，作者们绝对有撰写一部畅销魔幻小说的深厚功力。正义/邪恶，生存/死亡，杀戮/放生等人性和生命的主题引人哲思；如果去电影院是用2.5h欣赏了一部有深度的电影，那么在BG3，你是用100h+去体验有无奈有选择有善恶的跌宕魔幻人生。
我把游戏结束后在营地跟大家聊天的最后存档命名“Do not want to say Farewell”，一路走来，跟这堆朋友和战友同甘共苦，真的希望能一起继续生活下去，最后营地跟大家聊天穷尽选项，试图寻找更多的互动，特别是跟影心的七八次拥抱还留有数据的余温，舍不得说再见。但是Larian残忍又仁慈地让每个同行者带着伤痕继续前行——有人背负星辰远征，有人归于市井炊烟。这何尝不是最温柔的现实主义：所有相遇终究要归还给时光。
至此，我的龙与地下城故事已封存在剑湾的晚风中，有生之年，我还会再体验阿斯代伦和其它角色的一生。或许这正是CRPG的伟大之处：它允许我们在现实生活的夹缝里，体验无数个未曾活过的自己。

虽然也能看到一些对BG3批评改进的意见，但是瑕不掩瑜，个人认为有些地方确实可以再改进以方便玩家，有些意见却是因人而异而不能算作缺点和批评。
当你花了10-15h去学习这个游戏的机制和基本原理后跨过门槛，你真的无法想象Larian是如何创作出这样一部伟大作品的。如果这部作品无法被超越，是因为她确实太精湛也值得珍惜。如果被超越，那么游戏史上又多了另一颗明珠，也是我们的另一份礼物。
谢谢你，Larian。

A Love Letter to the Ninth Art – A Middle-Aged Player's 100-Hour Journey Through Baldur's Gate 3

As someone nearing forty, with both elderly parents and young children to care for, finding large chunks of time to sit in front of a computer and savor a game is no easy feat. This Spring Festival, I made up my mind to finally taste this cup of coffee that had been brewing for years. With the understanding and support of my wife (for which I am deeply grateful), I managed to carve out a week to indulge in uninterrupted play. After 99 hours and 40 minutes, I completed the game. Sitting in front of the screen late at night, I was left in awe, unable to shake the profound impact it had on me. This journey will undoubtedly remain one of the most unforgettable experiences of my life, a radiant milestone in my personal gaming history.

What Larian has created here is far from an ordinary video game.

As a game, every design element is seamlessly integrated, perfectly balanced. The freedom it offers is almost overwhelming—you can truly be yourself. The equipment, levels, and stats are meticulously crafted, catering to a broad spectrum of players.

As music, Down by the River drifts with the breeze, becoming a flowing narrative. I Want to Live tears at your soul during moments of decision, and The Power resonates as you grasp the prism in victory. Each theme song fits its scene so perfectly that it transcends the medium, transforming into an interactive symphonic poem that I found myself revisiting and reflecting on long after the game had ended.

As a novel, the content itself is a masterful piece of fantasy literature. The writers clearly possess the skill to craft a best-selling fantasy novel. Themes of justice versus evil, life versus death, and killing versus sparing provoke deep philosophical reflection. If watching a movie in a theater is like spending 2.5 hours appreciating a thought-provoking film, then Baldur's Gate 3 is like spending over 100 hours living a tumultuous, magical life filled with difficult choices and moral dilemmas.

I named my final save file in the camp, where I chatted with everyone before the end, ""Do Not Want to Say Farewell."" After journeying together, sharing both hardships and triumphs with these friends and comrades, I truly wished we could continue living together. I exhausted every dialogue option in the camp, searching for more interactions, especially with Shadowheart, whose seven or eight hugs still lingered with the warmth of data. I couldn’t bear to say goodbye. Yet, Larian, in their cruel yet merciful way, allowed each companion to move forward with their scars—some destined to carry the stars on their shoulders, others to return to the mundane life of hearth and home. This, perhaps, is the most tender form of realism: all encounters must eventually be returned to the passage of time.

Thus, my Dungeons & Dragons tale has been sealed in the evening breeze of the Sword Coast. In this lifetime, I will return to experience the lives of Astarion and other characters. Perhaps this is the greatness of CRPGs: they allow us, in the crevices of our real lives, to live countless versions of ourselves we never had the chance to be.

While there are some criticisms and suggestions for improvement regarding BG3, they are minor blemishes on an otherwise flawless gem. Some aspects could indeed be tweaked for player convenience, while others are subjective preferences rather than flaws.

Once you’ve spent 10-15 hours learning the game’s mechanics and fundamental principles, crossing that threshold, you can’t help but marvel at how Larian managed to create such a masterpiece. If this work remains unrivaled, it’s because it is truly exquisite and deserves to be cherished. If it is ever surpassed, then another jewel will have been added to the annals of gaming history, another gift for us all.

Thank you, Larian. | This is probably going to be one of the best games for the next decade, the voice acting is sublime and the writers seemed to have made deals with the devil in order to make such a good tale. 10/10 | The replayability of this game is insane, Larian did an amazing job giving us exactly what we wanted and maybe even a little more. This game has taken over my life and I love it so much, lol, and showing no signs of putting it down any time soon! | I have played this game for 6 hours (2h on character creator), never played this type of game before.. can say I am impressed and enjoying it a lot.

18 hours in the game: I think that I'm addicted. The stories are surprising and wholesome. I feel like a hero in this game, living for the good of the people.

50 hours: I finally finished act 1. And oh boy did I turn from good to evil with every step I took. I didn't mean to be... How was I supposed to know that pulling the wrong lever, I'll be catapulting a gnome to space. That wasn't my fault.

80 hours: Yes! Give me your gold. All the shiny trinkets you have. Give me your soul and all the power you hold. Give me more... MORE!

100 hours: How dare you look down on me, thinking like you could ever defeat me?! Hit me with all you got, it will never be enough!

120 hours: ... *only screams echo in the darkness* ...

130 hours: *Muahahaha-*
You may call me the blood queen,
but your agenda is also driven by greed.
The battle you lost, your advisors lied.
Your heroes are dead, your city is mine.
No evil as dark or vengeance as red,
have never been seen as I took the kings head. | I started playing this game a year and a few months after it was launched and immediately got into character creation which took me over an hour not to mention building my Dream Guardian. Since purchasing it at full price, I was weary to buy a game for 60 bucks, but it has been the best 60 bucks I've spent in a LONG time. 

The whole game itself doesn't hold your hand during the game, but it does help you build up your skills and learn how to play as you go which is great for those who haven't played CRPG turn based game before. I have basically played this nonstop since October to pass time and as you can see with my 527 hours on record, I absolutely LOVE this game. The options for responses and endings are endless. I'm thoroughly blown away with the voice acting and, yes, the mod options. There are many people who hate playing with mods, but to me it adds a lot to the game and enhances my game play experience making me want to play it more. I have done numerous campaigns and as of January 2025, I'm doing my 2nd durge campaign trying to play a somewhat evil character which is hard as I've cried from being evil to pixels haha. 

Overall, I think this game may be the best game I've ever played and I love how Larian and the VA's show their active participation in the community along with Larian giving us FREE updates and gives modders the toolkit. This company could've charged $100 or more for this game with the amount of work and thought put into it along with the (again) FREE updates, but they didn't. They have shown they care more for the player's experience and making a game that out beats other new games and certain *ahem developers AHEM Bethesda* by giving us a game that is completed at release (from what I've been told by other gamers who played this at release). I recommend this game to anyone who wants a rich, fulfilling game that doesn't have any extra catches outside the initial price."

Upon closer inspection of the Space CREW , it has become abundantly clear that this title presents itself as an exceptional tool for honing one’s tactical acumen in the cold, void-laden expanses of space. In the pursuit of excellence and the eradication of chaos, this simulation demonstrates the highest degree of mechanical efficiency, visual splendor, and a narrative framework worthy of the Emperor’s praise.

The game’s systems are nothing short of flawless, operating with an unwavering precision akin to the finest Imperial war machines. Each crew member's role is of vital importance, and it is through tight coordination and perfect execution of duties that the player survives. Should you falter, the unforgiving void will claim your soul. Whether managing the ship's engines, weapon systems, or the delicate dance of inter-crew communication, every decision made will shape the fate of your crew. The learning curve is steep, but it is a trial by fire that strengthens the resolve of any who dare to command.

In true Inquisitorial fashion, Space CREW offers a rigorous challenge to all who dare enter its domain. No quarter is given, and every mission could be your last. The complexity of the tasks and the ever-present threat of failure make each victory all the sweeter. Those unprepared will fall swiftly, their lives extinguished in the blink of an eye, but those who persist will be rewarded with the satisfaction of having survived the most brutal trials the universe can offer.

As an Inquisitor, I hereby declare Space CREW a most worthy investment for those seeking a challenging, immersive experience. The mechanics are precise, the visuals are captivating, and the narrative, though understated, adds depth to the experience. The universe is vast, and the dangers are many, but with the proper coordination and strategy, victory is within your grasp. The Emperor would approve.

5 out of 5 stars, with the Emperor’s blessing. | I'd still like to put in more time but one of my favourite aspects of this game is how it scratches an itch I've had for a while:  A solid Star Trek-like experience. One where I can get lost in the future, exploring the cosmos. | I enjoyed Bomber Crew a few years ago, however at this point I don’t like this franchise’s enemy tagging system. I’d rather the game have less busy work while focusing on more interesting strategies."
76561197976281073,1507190,Machinika: Museum,4.083333333333333,"Adventure, Casual, Indie",0,"Cool puzzle game, sound and graphics are pretty satisfying | Недолгая, но интересная игра-головоломка с продолжением!)
Очень понравилась, абсолютно не напряжная, со своим стилем и историей игра. Однозначно рекомендую! | Decent enough puzzle box game, especially for the price I got it at ($1.19). I think the item duplication and endoscope mechanics helped make it a bit more unique. Not fantastic, but might scratch an itch if you're a fan of the genre. | There is a lot to be said about Machinika: Museum, mostly good and a little bad.  Let me start by saying the I loved the game overall.  I purchased this at a heavy discount, but would have purchased it at the full $7.99 USD price, it would be worth that price tag.  My short review will be broken down into 3 parts.

The Short Review: 4/5 Stars overall good game the puzzles are a bit easy for advanced puzzlers who have played games like the Myst Series, and others in the genre.  Visuals are good, could use more scene variation.  Music fits, but could use some varition.  Price is fitting for game length. 

The Good:  The graphics are very good, lend a sense of realism to the world they are crafted in. They are smooth throughout and I didn't detect or have in glitching or clipping of any kind. The music is fitting to the game and story. The sounds are solid and fit the environment well.  The game play and controls are nice land end themselves to the realism of the environment.  I also liked how when you finished a chapter the puzzle crate slowly built up in the room. The ability to move an object in a full circle was a nice touch.  (I have seen and played other games where you just ""travel"" to the other side of an item instead of manipulating the object to turn it.) 

The Bad: (More like small nit-picks) I dislike Chapter breakdowns. Yeah I get it you are finished with one puzzle and it is time to move to the next puzzle.  I would have liked to have seen another location in the museum. or had a cut scene to show the delivery of another artifact.  The same goes for the music, do not get me wrong the music fits the game, I just wish there was more of it and also for it to change with the game and with certain scenes to add to the tension.  

The Ugly: (Not as bad as you would think)  I needed more game, yes for the price you get about 5-ish hours of game play.  Not bad given the complexity of the puzzles and game play had I not blundered through a few puzzles and remembered the tools I had at my disposable I probably would have completed the game in a trim 4 hrs.  Needed change of scenery and music between puzzles.

In closing the Developers and persons who created this game did an excellent job. I look forward to seeing what Machinika: Atlas has to offer though it appears that the game may be delayed for release, because in the game it seems to be expected by Late 2024. I just bought and finished this game in January of 2025.

It sucks because the steam release is half baked and seems like it was published as a draft by a bunch of interns. There is no save functionality. The UI is unintuitive and prone to causing serious errors or missed opportunities. What's really bad is with seemingly just a few more hours of work and addressing feedback this could be a fine adaptation. Instead we have hot garbage that demonstrates the continued disregard of the developers with every day this awful game isn't patched. | I've had this game for a few years now and I have to say this is a fantastic version of the board game.  The art is great, the music is awesome and I love all the expansions and, with Nomad games making them playable for free at various times, you can try them before you buy!  If you love the board game (and I do) you won't be disappointed with this version | I really wanted to like this game, even if it is based on a board game that is really old. The early aspects I found quite enjoyable, moving around the board, facing encounters, and getting stronger. Two aspects of this game just killed it for me: PVP and the end game. Essentially, I see no real reason to do anything but a strength character. Craft lets you get around a little easier at times, but strength can just steamroll everything, and if a caster has to PVP a strength character, they lose. The end game is nothing but luck. I spent nine rounds on the crown, and only twice did the command spell work. By then, two other strength players had reached me, and even with decent strength, it couldn't compete with those who had strength in double digits. It just killed the whole experience for me, as I had no method to win. Even the others agreed how broken it was. Don't bother with this one. | до выхода нового талисмана игруля была имбищем. боты, которые тебя постоянно ебут и срут заклинаниями, рандом (который часто давал говнище реальным игрокам и балдеж ботам) тоже прикольный. можно кастомить каждую катку по-разному.... но.. после обновы НЕ ТОЛЬКО У МЕНЯ перестал работать онлайн. в попытке просто зайти в лобби выкидывает других игроков, в том числе и хозяина лобби, в итоге хорошо работает соло режим. я очень расстроена, новую часть покупать не хочу, а работать нормально перестало как раз с ее выходом (совсем не подозрительно) | Excelente juego, jugué 76 horas y aun no terminé la primera partida"

76561197970569635,220,Half-Life 2,0.0,Action,0,"A monumental game in my gaming career, Half-Life 2 was that defining experience that made me realise I was in for something next level. For the first time i picked it up on The Orange Box in 2008, and from the moment I booted it up, I knew I was in for a wild ride. It wasn’t just a game—it was an event. The environments were absolutely massive, the atmosphere was unreal, and the soundtrack? Edgy as hell. Every moment felt like a cinematic journey.

In Half-Life 2, you play as Gordon Freeman, arguably one of the most reluctant action heroes in gaming. You awaken from stasis, burdened with the trauma of the previous game, and are immediately thrust into action as the figurehead of an uprising. This isn’t a simple revolution—it’s a battle against a multiversal alien threat, shrouded in dystopian themes and orchestrated by secretive organizations manipulating events behind the scenes.

Set in a world dominated by the Combine, an alien regime that combines interdimensional authoritarianism with advanced technology, you must navigate a planet under their control. Armed with little more than a crowbar and your signature nonverbalism, Gordon becomes the key figure in the resistance. As you progress, you'll engage in intense combat, solve puzzles, explore diverse environments, and uncover the unsettling truth that nothing in this world is as it seems.

And let’s talk about The G-Man—a mysterious, interdimensional CIA glowman who pops up like a bad dream and probably controls the entire charade like a cosmic puppeteer. Is he good? Is he bad? Is he just playing the long game? Who knows, but he’s definitely got his hand in everything, watching Gordon like a hawk, pulling strings like an invisible god. 

You’d think it’s just a sci-fi conspiracy, but after a while, you start questioning if anyone really knows what the hell is going on. Does G-Man even have a purpose, or is he just a cosmic observer who gets his kicks out of watching a man with a crowbar take on the end of the world?

The game’s narrative feels like a giant puzzle, and each step forward opens up even more questions, all while you’re tearing through enemy lines, trying to get answers. And the best part? It’s not all about combat—there are puzzles to solve, mysteries to uncover, and a sense of isolation that keeps you on edge, constantly wondering who or what will show up next. The pacing is incredible, making you feel like you’re a tiny piece of something far larger, with consequences that span across dimensions.

Now when the episodes are combines (haha) The user experience is smooth and now it is even moddable! 5/5 | Крутейшее продолжение, не менее крутейшей первой части. Как же жаль, что я ознакомился с игрой только в прошлом году.
Не совершайте моей ошибки. Лучше пройдите сейчас если не прошли раньше. Вы многое теряете. 
У игры даже сейчас спустя 20 лет с релиза есть чем вас удивить | 之前20周年更新开发者评论模式后我又打了一遍，阀是怎样做到的，让我反复爱上它们的游戏。在游戏里跟开发者评论一起探索是我最喜欢的事，我喜欢看游戏开发历程和小故事，实在是让人大开眼界。
为什么这个滑梯不能上去，这个跷跷板是可以玩的，原来这里也有小巧思，这里的电线是视觉引导物，怎样保持一个休闲和紧张的平衡，能在游戏里亲自上手跟看GDC或者工具箱是完全不一样的体验，我会贪婪地希望每一个我喜欢的游戏都添加开发者评论。 | ""Half-Life 2"" is one of the most influential and groundbreaking first-person shooters ever made. Released in 2004 by Valve, it redefined what players could expect from a video game in terms of both storytelling and gameplay. The game’s narrative is immersive, unfolding without traditional cutscenes, which allows the player to feel like they are truly part of the story. The protagonist, Gordon Freeman, is a silent hero who navigates through a dystopian world filled with alien invaders and oppressive human forces. This unique approach to storytelling pulls the player into the game’s world, making every action feel meaningful.

The physics engine in ""Half-Life 2"" was revolutionary for its time. The way objects interact with the environment feels natural and intuitive, and it became a major part of the gameplay. From solving puzzles using physics to creatively using the environment as a weapon, it was an innovation that influenced many games that followed. The gravity gun, which allows players to manipulate objects in real-time, is still one of the most memorable and fun weapons in gaming history.

The level design in ""Half-Life 2"" is another standout feature. The game introduces players to varied environments, from the dark, industrial city of City 17 to the eerie, remote marshlands. Each location feels carefully crafted, with attention to detail that makes the world feel alive. The pacing is also masterful, alternating between moments of intense combat and slower, atmospheric sequences that allow the player to soak in the environment and story.

The AI in ""Half-Life 2"" was also ahead of its time. Enemies behave intelligently, using cover, working together, and reacting to the player’s actions in a way that makes combat more dynamic and challenging. The enemy variety, from the terrifying Combine soldiers to the creepy headcrabs, keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging. The interactions with NPCs and the world around you help build a sense of tension and immersion, keeping you on edge throughout the experience.

The game's soundtrack, composed by Kelly Bailey, perfectly complements the atmosphere, using subtle but effective music to enhance both the action and the quieter moments. The sound design is top-notch, with ambient sounds adding to the immersion, whether you're in a busy city street or exploring a deserted warehouse.

Ultimately, ""Half-Life 2"" is a masterpiece that still holds up to this day. Its innovative gameplay, storytelling, and technical achievements make it a game that set a new standard for the industry. It’s a game that’s not just fun to play, but one that’s easy to appreciate for the way it shaped the future of video games. Even though it’s been years since its release, ""Half-Life 2"" remains a classic that continues to inspire both players and developers alike.

 | One of the best games of all time. You're using the game service that spawned because of their innovative ideas. Gaben please call me ill sell my bussy for less than you think ;)

Counter-Strike: Source (CS: Source) is the definitive version of one of the most iconic tactical shooters ever created. Built on the Source engine, it brought stunning graphics, refined mechanics, and an immersive experience that kept players engaged for years. It improved upon its predecessor, Counter-Strike 1.6, and laid the foundation for future games in the series, including Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Here's why CS: Source remains a perfect 10/10 for fans of competitive gaming.

At the core of CS: Source is its tight and rewarding gun mechanics. Every weapon in the game feels unique, with its own recoil patterns and handling characteristics. This precision-driven combat is one of the key factors that makes CS: Source such a compelling competitive experience. From the M4A4's controlled spray to the AWP's one-shot kills, every engagement requires skill and accuracy.

🌍 Map Design & Tactical Depth
The iconic maps like Dust 2, Inferno, and Nuke are where the game shines brightest. Each map is meticulously designed to offer a balance of tactical positions, choke points, and strategic opportunities. Whether you're defending bomb sites or pushing through tight corridors, the map design fosters deep teamwork and careful planning.

💥 Gameplay Mechanics
CS: Source features smooth, fluid movement, making it easy to peek around corners, hold angles, and strafe while shooting. The buy system gives players the freedom to choose their preferred weapons and gear, while round-based gameplay forces teams to be efficient with their resources and execute well-planned strategies.

🎮 Vibrant Community & Modding Support
The modding community for CS: Source has been incredibly active, creating a wealth of custom content from maps to skins to even entirely new game modes. This extends the life of the game by offering nearly endless ways to enjoy the experience. The server browser lets players dive into unique community-run servers, making every session feel fresh and exciting.

🎨 Improved Visuals
Powered by the Source engine, CS: Source delivered a massive graphical leap from its predecessors, offering realistic lighting, better textures, and advanced physics. These improvements gave the game a more immersive and polished feel, while the physics engine introduced interactive objects and destructible environments, adding a layer of depth to gameplay.

What Makes It a 10/10
CS: Source isn’t just a game; it’s a tactical masterpiece that’s stood the test of time. Its emphasis on team coordination, strategy, and individual skill is unmatched. Whether playing with friends or random players, the experience fosters a strong sense of community and competition, making each match feel meaningful. The team-based objectives – like bomb planting/defusal – combined with tight, tactical combat is a dynamic experience that few shooters can replicate.

The longevity of CS: Source is a testament to how well it was designed. While newer titles in the series (like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive) have taken inspiration from it, the smoothness of the gameplay, iconic maps, and endless customization options keep it relevant in the competitive FPS scene.

If you’re a fan of shooters and haven’t experienced CS: Source, you’re missing out on one of the most influential and well-rounded tactical shooters ever made. It’s a game that offers both depth and accessibility, making it suitable for casual players, yet still offering enough challenge for the competitive elite. CS: Source is a timeless classic—pure, competitive, and still as enjoyable today as it was when it first released."

76561197970569635,360,Half-Life Deathmatch: Source,0.0,Action,0,"Rating: 7/10

Half-Life: Deathmatch: Source is a multiplayer first-person shooter developed by Valve. It is a remake of the classic Half-Life deathmatch mode, utilizing the Source engine. The game combines the fast-paced action of traditional deathmatch with updated graphics and more fluid movement mechanics. While it successfully brings new life to the original concept, some mechanical issues and a niche player base prevent it from being as popular as its predecessors.

What Works Well?
🎮 Classic Deathmatch Gameplay
The core of Half-Life: Deathmatch is its tight, fast-paced combat. It stays true to the original deathmatch mode, offering classic weapons, high-speed action, and simple, enjoyable mechanics. The formula remains as fun today as it was when first introduced.

🌆 Updated Graphics with Source Engine
The move to the Source engine has significantly improved the visuals compared to the original. The lighting, textures, and models are much sharper, breathing new life into the iconic Half-Life universe. The environments feel more immersive, and physics interactions are more dynamic.

🔫 Familiar Weapon Set
Players have access to a variety of classic weapons from the Half-Life series, including the crowbar, shotgun, and crossbow, all of which perform as expected. Each weapon has its own strategic value, and they all function well within the confines of the deathmatch setting.

🛠️ Modding Support and Custom Servers
As with other Source engine games, Deathmatch: Source allows for a robust modding community. Players can easily find custom servers and user-created content, from new maps to modified gameplay modes, keeping the experience fresh.

What Could Be Better?
❌ Limited Popularity and Player Base
Despite its solid foundation, Half-Life: Deathmatch: Source suffers from a relatively small player base. As newer games in the genre continue to dominate, it can be difficult to find active matches, especially in more niche servers.

❌ Physics Can Feel Clunky
While the Source engine improved many aspects of the game, some of the physics—especially in terms of movement—can feel a little awkward compared to modern shooters. The transition to 3D space feels a bit more restrictive than anticipated, particularly when compared to the fluidity of more modern games.

❌ No Significant Gameplay Innovation
While the updated graphics and better physics are great, Deathmatch: Source doesn't introduce any major changes to the original formula. It feels more like a polished port rather than a revolutionary step forward for the genre. Players expecting something drastically new may be disappointed.

❌ Lack of Meaningful Progression
Like many classic deathmatch games, there’s a lack of meaningful progression or any form of unlockable content. While this keeps the focus on pure skill-based play, some players may miss the more modern systems that reward long-term engagement.

Conclusion
Half-Life: Deathmatch: Source is a solid multiplayer shooter for fans of the classic Half-Life experience. Its updated visuals and iconic weapons deliver the fun, high-speed action that fans love, but its small player base and lack of major innovation hold it back from achieving greater popularity. If you’re looking for nostalgic deathmatch action or enjoy modding, it’s a great choice, but don’t expect a revolutionary experience.

Rating: 7/10 – Fun for fans of classic shooters, but somewhat limited by its age and player base. 🎮💥 | Half Life 1'in klasik ve efsanevi ölüm maçı modu oyunu.

PopCap（宝开）公司牛逼！祖玛和植物大战僵尸都属于童年回忆，以简单规则+深度策略的范式革新了全球休闲游戏行业。只可惜宝开生不逢时，这家以创意为基因的工作室恰逢数字版权浑沌时期——当时盗版率高达95%。被EA并购，就好似一个村里的村花嫁给了城市里大腹便便的商人。不知道出于什么原因，EA压根不去翻新老游戏，收购之后的宝开新游戏也反响平平。祖玛在老电脑上是可以全屏的，如果我没有记错，当年还有汉化补丁。如果植物大战僵尸和祖玛这种创新并且有趣的游戏在今年才发售，必定也包括全屏和中文，爆炸性的销量不会让宝开最终沦为游戏史上又一起创造性毁灭的典型案例。 | It requires total concentration and does not allow you to think about anything else.

76561197970569635,3470,Unknown,7.866666666666666,,0,"Normally, games built around a single mechanic aren't very good.  Generally the designers run out of fresh ways to abuse the concept about an hour into the game, and as a gamer we're left with 10 more hours of rehash, possibly with a timer thrown in for artificial difficult.

Bookworm Adventures, on the other hand, is amazing.  It helps, certainly, that the central mechanic (boggle) is so much fun, but Popcap managed to stretch it in ways that would make 10 tons of silly putty jealous.  By occasionally adding simple embellishments, the designers open up tremendous new gameplay opportunities.  The main quest can take about 20 hours, but the gameplay always seems fresh.

It helps too that doing well in this game makes you feel smart.  This is a challenging game, especially later on, and it forces you to dig deeper and deeper into your vocabulary well.  Despite the challenge, however, the game rather cleverly helps you when you're struggling.  For every enemy you defeat, you gain experience and levels, which grant stat boosts.  You keep these levels even when you die.  If you're in a particularly tough spot, if you persevere, you'll eventually get through thanks to better levels and your own improvement.

Finally, this is a charming, funny game.  The premise is completely ridiculous, but Popcap decided to play it straight and it works really well.  Now, due to industry regulations, I am required to end this review of Bookworm Adventures with the following phrase: Sometimes the pen really is mightier than the sword. | I killed Medusa with the word 'poop'.

10/10 would kill legendary monsters with really immature words again. | Defeat monsters with the power of your words!  Save lives with your superior vocabulary!  I recommend xenophobic, quantum, and pizazz for those hard to use letters! | A spelling game that doesn't feel like english class, but instead an adventure that felt right at home in my childhood years. | Most think PopCap and go, ""Oh, stupid little casual games.""  Well, some are, but some aren't.  

Bookworm Adventure Deluxe is the result of mixing a word game and a turn-based RPG.  Don't confuse this with the original Bookworm, which was a word-based puzzle game only.

You attack in turns and the more complex the word you spelled, the greater damage it potentially does to the enemy.  Gem-based word tiles (a green gem word tile means it heals you, whereas a red game word tile sets the enemy on fire) can alter your attacks as well.  Potions are simple: one type heals you, one cures you (takes away all negative effects) and the other enhances your attack.

You can gain items which enhance your offensive, defensive or gem/potion collecting abilities.  Different enemies are weak or resistant to various attacks and effects and others can poison you, freeze you, set you on fire and do a whole lot more.

The story is broken into three chapters based on different mythologies (Greek, Arabian, and Eastern European) which add flavor to what could be otherwise be a game full of boring enemies.  Some of the enemies are really strange, too, but that's part of the game's humor.

All in all, I'd recommend getting this (preferably on a Steam sale) if you like puzzle games or RPGs at all.  The second game isn't as good, so just get this one."

76561197970569635,3340,AstroPop Deluxe,0.0,Casual,0,"A solid puzzle game using bricks and colors! (Played using a fix to get the game running and working on Windows 11)

AstroPop Deluxe is a brick based puzzle-game developed by PopCap. It follows 4 different space pilots as they crush same-colored bricks with a variety of different brick types, and devastating super weapons. It's a simple gameplay loop that gets it's mileage with addicting gameplay thanks to it's simplicity. 

Gameplay of AstroPop first starts with choosing a Pilot Character, while you only have 2 at the start, you'll be able to unlock them as you play through the campaigns. Character selection boils down to what type of Super Weapon you'll be use once it's meter is full, otherwise they all play the same. The goal of each level is to pop enough colored bricks to power your meter to blast off to the next level. As the name suggest these bricks are color coded, and break when 4 or more come in contact with each other. You make these matches by moving the colors between each other by columns, making it very strategic compared to other puzzle games of the ""match"" style. There's also special bricks that spawn as a round progress, ranging from making a specific color explosive, clearing a line either vertically or horizontally or ones like the stone and metal bricks that only serve to block your matches, requiring one or more nearby matches to break. As well as the Virus block which will start infecting other bricks into other Virus blocks until all of them are defeated. As mentioned you also have super weapon that charges on it's own and can be activated on a whim, allowing you to gain a significant edge if the current round you have is going poorly. Every handful of levels you can get story cutscenes, save points, and bonus levels that provide a brick puzzle to get the maximum amount of bonus points. 

Overall, AstroPop Deluxe is a fun little puzzle game. It certainly stand out from other match puzzles games you see all over the mobile app store and has a fun theming and artstyle to boot. It's somewhat lengthy if you try to complete all the characters campaigns but it's mostly more of the same between the 4 characters outside of their super weapons. Really this game needed a sequel like with what Bejeweled and Zuma got to really expand on this base idea with new gamemodes, pilots, or just other things to give more variety. But as a whole, other than the whole needing to fix the game to make saving work on modern hardware, it's a pretty swell purchase!

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-

  Ok this is a fairly controversial issue on the message boards.  
Stat-farming is when the player gets alot of gold and spends it on stat 
points in the temple so he/she can max his/her stats. This method usually 
relies on using seiged towns to produce money and the player may spend hours
going from town to town getting money to spend on stats. Stat-farming also 
requires the player to not spend any stat points before he/she does it, why?
Because the more points you have in the skill, the more it costs to add 
points to it. So what YOU should do is save all your level up points until 
your done stat-farming then spend them on on what you would like to upgrade 
once you finish your stat-farming session. Heres what I think,I stat farm 
for about 1 and a half hours on a playthrough, I get as much money as I can
in that amount of time using a specific money route and spend 50 points 
worth on fire and the rest on the other masteries just to balance things 
alot a little better. Why 50 points on fire? Because the max limit for stat
points is 255 points and you recieve 196 from just level-up points.50+196
(because you should spend every level-up point on fire) is 246 giving you 
about 10 points of room away from the point cap of 255. I have this 
""giveway"" room because if you exceed 255 points than your mastery goes back 
down to zero. The extra room is for quests that give fire points 
automatically that weay you dont screw yourself over :).



			   ***How and When to Stat Farm***

  So you want to stat farm, huh? I'm warning you that after you do it the 
game becomes a real pushover in terms of difficulty. If you are still 
willing to I will tell you how to stat farm effectively. 

When to Stat Farm: Personally I do it beofre Dugog because I believe he is 
the hardest boss to fight in the game. I stat farm before him so that I can 
beat him easily as opposed to trying 20 times to kill him while i'm weak.

How to Stat Farm: OK, some people use the ""Stolen Catapult"" quest which 
gives myou a fair amount of gold for completeing it by I seige cities and 
accept tribute. The cities I seige are Enmouth, Galia and Drakenburg. After 
these cities are seiged I use a route that goes like this: 

1. Start at Skellheim(between Drakenburg and Galia) on the 1st or 4th.
2. Go to Galia.
3. Go to Bartonia.
4. Then Enmouth.
5. Then Elenia(between Enmouth and Bartonia).
6. Go back to Enmouth
7. All the way back down to Drakenburg 
8. Go to Skellheim.
9. Then back to Drakenburg.
10 Then to Skellheim and your back where you started except 2700(something 
like that) gold richer.
11. Spend it at the temple on Fire and other masteries. | THE match-3 RPG. Give it a shot!"

Ви коли-небудь хотіли пограти щось в епоху чистого, я маю на увазі без магічних штук, середньовіччя? Якщо так, то ця гра саме те, що потрібно. Тут є досить великий відкритий світ, гра не заганяє в рамки, ви можете робити все що спаде на думку і бути будь-ким: розбійником, найманцем, торговцем, лордом або кинути виклик усім і стати володарем власного королівства, а згодом і королем усієї Кальрадії. З часом гра починає набридати, тоді на сцену виходять модифікації, це є ще одним великим плюсом. У вас є можливість перетворити гру на будь-що, від сонячного ""Дикого заходу"" і моторошних земель ""Володаря перснів"", до космічних просторів із всесвіту ""Зоряних війн"".

Ця гра сильно затягує, тому якщо вона вам сподобається, то з великою ймовірністю у перші дні буде награно кілька десятків годин. Серйозно, мені було важко з неї вийти, постійно в голові складав план, наприклад, ось завершу цей квест і виходжу, а в цей момент на карті з'являлися кілька лутерів і я такий ""перемагаю їх і на сьогодні досить"", але потім все затяглося на кшталт зроблю це, зроблю то, продам то, знищу тих, бах і замок в осаді... Дивлюся, а надворі вже ніч і треба лягати спати. Спочатку я взагалі думав зайти побігати трохи, зробити кілька знятків і вийти. І я набігав аж 130 годин за кілька тижнів.

Дивлячись на негативні рецензії, то 75% з них є просто через те, що існує M&B Warband, як на мене це не зовсім справедливо, але я розумію їх, він дійсно краще, як з технічного стану так і візуально, і так, я [b]РЕКОМЕНДУЮ[/b] починати з Warband, але не слід забувати, що оригінальний M&B це по суті його фундамент і обзивати його лохом через те, що у нього є менший брат, який набагато кращий у всьому, я не можу.

Українізатора для M&B на жаль немає, але в цій ситуації я не впевнений, чи він взагалі потрібен, як я писав вище, краще починати з Warband, Українізатор для якого є.

[h1]7 полонених королів з 10[/h1] | Mount & Blade – це унікальна серія, яка втілює мрію кожного гравця про свободу у відкритому середньовічному світі. Розроблена турецькою студією TaleWorlds Entertainment, гра стала справжнім подарунком для любителів стратегій, ролевих ігор та епічних битв. Незважаючи на відсутність глянцю великих ААА-проєктів, Mount & Blade захоплює своєю глибиною та неповторним шармом.

Свобода вибору
Однією з найбільших переваг Mount & Blade є повна свобода дій. Ви починаєте як невідомий мандрівник і можете стати ким завгодно: найманцем, торговцем, лордом чи навіть королем власного королівства. Гравець має змогу самостійно вирішувати, як писати свою історію в світі Калрадії – фентезійного середньовічного континенту, наповненого політичними інтригами, війнами та нескінченними можливостями.

Бойова система
Mount & Blade відома своєю реалістичною та динамічною бойовою системою. Битви відбуваються в реальному часі, і від вашої майстерності залежить результат кожного поєдинку. Можливість брати участь у масштабних битвах, керувати загоном чи навіть стати героєм, який змінить хід війни, дарує незабутні враження. Ви відчуєте всю вагу меча, точність стріл і потужність кавалерійської атаки.

Стратегічні елементи
Крім бойових аспектів, Mount & Blade пропонує широкий спектр стратегічних можливостей. Ви можете формувати власну армію, керувати ресурсами, будувати економічні ланцюжки та укладати дипломатичні угоди. Захоплення міст і замків, боротьба за політичний вплив та управління підданими додають глибини ігровому процесу.

Атмосфера та світ
Калрадія – це світ, сповнений життя, історій і конфліктів. Різні фракції, культури та політичні амбіції створюють динамічне середовище, де кожна дія гравця впливає на подальший розвиток подій. Атмосфера середньовіччя відчувається у всьому: від музичного супроводу до деталей одягу та архітектури.

Особливості серії
Mount & Blade: Warband – вершина класичної серії, яка додала мультиплеєр і розширила можливості для створення власного королівства.
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord – довгоочікуване продовження, яке зберегло дух оригіналу, але вивело графіку, механіку та масштабність гри на новий рівень.
Графіка та технічні аспекти
Хоча графіка Mount & Blade не є найсильнішою стороною серії, це з лишком компенсується глибоким геймплеєм і багатством можливостей. Своєрідна естетика додає шарму та допомагає зосередитися на головному – на грі.

Модифікації – душа Mount & Blade
Окремої уваги заслуговують моди. Спільнота фанатів створила величезну кількість модифікацій, які додають нові фракції, епохи та навіть змінюють сеттинг гри. Хочете опинитися у Середзем’ї з ""Володаря перснів"" чи перенестися у світ вікінгів? Завдяки модам це можливо.

Загальне враження
Mount & Blade – це гра, яка дає вам більше, ніж ви очікуєте. Вона не хапає зірок із неба у графіці чи постановці, але її глибина, свобода та реалістичність роблять її однією з найкращих у своєму жанрі. Це проєкт для тих, хто любить виклики, стратегії та хоче творити власну історію у світі середньовіччя.

Оцінка: 9/10
Mount & Blade – це гра для душі, яка вимагає часу, але нагороджує незабутніми враженнями. | ilk m&b.

It was very much of the era (being a game from 2008 and all) but doesn't really look visually interesting. 

Also, minor nitpick: leveling up towers is done on a green-yellow-red color scale, as well as visual changes to the tower itself.

Achei o combate terrestre bastante chato, o que pra mim é o que torna ele o pior da franquia que eu já joguei.

1. First things first, kudos to the devs for making a non-sexualised female mc back in the day against the norms (even if it was today, we all know a large portion of ""Gamers"" would lose their mind screaming DEI and woke lol). 

2. Secondly, the art direction is superb and it shows that stylistic approach stands the test of time better than realism (look at any REALISTIC graphics game from back then that people lost their shit over, now they just look ugly af). 

3. The parkour is unique, feels great to play on controller, and is easy to learn but hard to master. When you pull off some cool wallrun-turn-jump-walllrun combo, you'd feel like a total badass.

4. The voice actors have done a terrific job giving personality to the characters. I really enjoys Merc's voice guiding me through the levels, and the others were NOT far worse too.

1. The story is dogshit. It works well enough to connect one parkouring stage to another, but don't go in expecting any story that might emotionally involve you lol.

2. The combat sections feel unnecessary and underdeveloped. Maybe it's just my problem, but I felt like the game would've been better if they scraped the combat totally and added a few more parkouring challenged instead.

[h2] Some points to note [/h2]

1. The game is short. I died a lot of times, stayed afk during game time watching game of thrones (lol) and yet i completed the game under 6 and a 1/2 hours. It might be a deal breaker for some, but I think this was well worth the money.

2. When you play, turn OFF the PhysX, or the game would suffer severe framerate drop everytime a glass shatters (any combat section, really).

[h2] Conclusion [/h2]

Albeit short and emotionally not gripping, Mirror's edge boasts fun and unique gameplay with great visuals to date and a pure good fun time. I recommend this.

Together with the mod Ultimate Exterminatus, which I highly recommend, the campaign becomes a great experience (on top of what it already was) with great replayability. | Dawn of War 2 jest grą strategiczną rozgrywaną w czasie rzeczywistym w jednym z najpopularniejszych uniwersów przyszłości – gotyckim świecie Warhammera 40000, w którym krwawą walkę toczą między sobą przedstawiciele kilkunastu armii.

Tym razem w trybie single player gracz może poprowadzić do boju oddziały świetnie wyszkolonych Space Marines.

W odróżnieniu od poprzedniej części mamy zdecydowanie większy wpływ na kolejność zajmowanych terytoriów.

Nasze oddziały przed każdą bitwą znajdują się bowiem na statku kosmicznym orbitującym wokół planety, o którą toczy się walka.

Każda misja zwieńczona jest potyczką z tzw. bossem, czyli przeciwnikiem, który jest bardziej odporny na obrażenia i dysponuje potężniejszymi atakami niż większość wrogów.

Wraz z postępami w grze, wzrasta poziom doświadczenia Kosmicznych Marines, dzięki czemu z zadania na zadanie coraz lepiej radzą sobie w boju.

W Dawn of War 2 dowodzimy oddziałami najczęściej składającymi się tylko z kilku żołnierzy, wobec czego autorzy chcąc, aby gracz łatwiej się z nimi identyfikował postanowili je spersonalizować.

Tak więc każdy z nich posiada własną nazwę oraz lidera wymienionego nie tylko z pełnionej funkcji, ale także z imienia i nazwiska. | Great game. One of the WH40k and general best ones.

On that note, I have mixed feelings about the new campaign. The difficulty curve is rather steep and the new corruption mechanic is kind of pointless because you have to pretty much skip content in order to gain corruption. Either that or purposely equip increasingly cursed items like an idiot.
On the flip side I like the new psyker unit and the new weapons are welcome additions. I even went out of my way to rotate characters around to try the new gear.
Besides that the game is rather janky these days, especially the sound, so I encountered more technical problems that I care to mention. The highlight of the issues was probably bosses pushing Cyrus outside of the level geometry.
Anyway, that's all I have to say since this is an expansion and not a new game. I'm not the biggest fan of this one and I think it's unlikely to change anyone's opinion if they didn't like the base game but I think you literally can't purchase Dawn of War II without all of the expansions anymore so you'll get it regardless. | Отлизанные мужики в силовой броне, пиз****я с другими мужиками в силовой броне с шипами, происходит лютое гачимучи под мега эпичные треки.

Out of all the game this one caused me the least technical issues and it's also the most complete in terms of content so Retribution is the best for playing skirmishes.
Besides that the campaign makes a return with a new party of heroes, this time based off the commander units from the skirmish mode, and the conclusion to the story that started in the first Dawn of War with some pretty cool cutscenes. 
But I saved the best for last: the campaign can be played with all 6 races. They vary in quality but they are all rich on hammy voice acting.
The only issue is that the campaign is always the same with slightly different dialogue. Some elements from skirmish mode are present such as building units but the levels are fairly linear so there's little space for the dynamic battles from actual skirmishes. Also, one of your heroes is always silent and that blows.
In conclusion, I think Retribution is pretty good. It's sad that it never reached the level of polish that Company of Heroes has but Warhammer is obviously more niche than World War 2 so that's understandable."

And it's a great experience still, holding up far better for me than the likes of [i]Braid[/i] and [i]Limbo[/i].  That's strange, since 2D was and is easier to make [i]immediately[/i] playable on a smaller dev budget.  Now, there [i]is[/i] a little jank in this, as you would expect to find in a [b]3D indie game[/b] made before there was even a real 2D indie boom -- but not nearly as much as I feared.  The wild [b]bio-punk[/b] style comes through as strong as ever without RTX/SSAO/8K textures/DLSS and whatever all the rest of the game-delaying, budget-bloating nonsense is -- and I found myself getting sucked right back in to the wacky world of Zenozoik after knocking about an even jankier and much less interesting reality for a decade-plus.

Such jank as you might experience is all baked into the game engine, primarily in the slight sense of [i]delay[/i] and the queuing you get with the melee inputs.  Ghat's main fisty combo, for instance, is set off by [b]holding[/b] the button down until it is complete, with the other button for hard attacks.  It's polished enough that you can definitely [i]get good[/i] at it, but sometimes the delay will make you feel like a madman flailing with rage when you're in the thick of a big battle.  It kind of works in a [i]thematic[/i] sense, really, when you consider the savage world you're in.  Some people complain about the gun combat too, but I think it works well enough; Ghat and his big extended family mostly fight with feet and fists, and since these biopunk guns, all made of bone, stone, and sinew, take work to reload and aim, [i]of course[/i] they might feel a trifle more awkward than those in a legit FPS.  I know it sounds like trying to wallpaper flaws with an imagined [b]meta-connection[/b] between story and gameplay, but it's seriously fine and feels good when you're actually playing and soaking up all the vibes.

Back in the 2009 of its original release, a lot of people played this because there weren't a lot of options -- it just so happened to be a very good, very memorable game despite the widespread attention it incidentally received.  Nowadays, it will appeal more to the PC indie crowd I think.  It's short, engrossing, and costs as much as a sachet of corn nuts when it's on sale, so why not throw it on the ol' wishlist? | Un clasico, quizas hoy no impresione mucho, pero en el contexto de este juego es super innovador, creativo y original.

O jogo tem altos aspectos positivos como por exemplo a arte visual, é simples e bem bonitinho, as músicas também são muito boazinhas de ouvir (mesmo depois de um bom tempo) e também, não é apenas puzzle, tem também uma historinha.
O jogo tem uma pegada muito igual a de Super Mario, desde alguns inimigos ou até mesmo o fato de você estar atrás de uma princesa e sempre quando você chega no castelo, ela não está lá.

A principal diferença de Braid nisso tudo é que você pode voltar no tempo. E isso abriu portas pra diversas mecânicas, seja apenas voltar no tempo pra impedir alguma morte, manipular determinados itens ou inimigos que não são afetados pelo tempo diferente de outros, criar clones de si mesmo que recriam todos os passos que você fez ou até mesmo criar campos de força que quanto mais próximo deles, mais devagar o tempo passa. Sério, todas essas mecânicas são muito legais na hora dos puzzles. 

Só que o jogo tem muitos pontos negativos também.

Alguns puzzles são MUITO dificeis, no nível de você se estressar MUITO. O jogo não deixa de nenhuma forma explícito como você deve resolver alguns puzzles, e muitos deles tem uma forma única de resolver e as vezes tão específica mas tão específica que chega a ser ridículo como um ser humano conseguiria pensar em resolver daquela forma. 
A história também é muito fraca e confusa, não faz o menor sentido e é uma leitura muito difícil. Outra coisa é que em vez de contarem aos poucos ao passar de cada fase, o jogo te apresenta um sistema de mundos aonde cada mundo tem um ""lobby"" e lá você pode ler toda a história de uma vez sem animação nenhuma. 
E também, a história não tem nada a ver com os puzzles ou as fases que você está jogando, é como se fossem duas coisas completamente diferentes, história e jogo.

No quesito história dos jogos, por ser um dos primeiros jogos indies mais relevantes ou no quesito puzzle-platform, que é definitivamente um dos mais diferentes que tem, é um jogo muito bom. Pra alguém que não é fã de jogos assim, mas decidiu dar uma chance porque tem muita gente que elogia, é um jogo muito chatinho. 7/10. | 毫无疑问的顶尖设计，游戏内的一切都围绕时间回溯的主题展开，尾声醍醐灌顶。

Каждая игра выходит в промежуток в 4 года, кроме 3 частей игры, о которой я напишу позже.

Геймплей: мы играем за трех персонажей сразу и просто переключаемся между ними, чтобы сражаться или решать головоломки. Персонажи: Рыцарь Понтий, Воровка Зоя и Волшебник Амадей.

Like Bookworm, this game is a solid word puzzler and requires a little thought in order to maximize points.

It's still pretty good, as was the last one. I throroughly enjoyed it when i was playing through Book 4 and I can't wait to get into the other two!

Hope to see more of these games in the future! [possibly BwA3?] | If you enjoyed Bookworm, but wanted a sense of place and a bit of narrative, you've come to the right place.

Two antlers up! | This is one of those games, where the more the merrier. Except when more is a bunch of 3 year olds who are so impresed they can spell a 4 letter word out of the pot and cries when you go with hypotenuse instead of deck. However this game not only gives you a small education that can be tollorated and used to trick parents into believing it is actually homework, it is one of those few games that parents can look over your shoulder and be helpful and not recoil in disgust as you succsessfully knife someone and are welcome with hi-def satisfaction, or in your mother's case, hi-def reasons to ban that game. However that's another game. In this game when your mom looks over your shoulder she has the power to pull out words that make no sense, and somehow ending up being a ""Fantastic"" or ""Astonishing"" word that takes the enemy out in one hit.

Also this game has such a good PC port that I didn't even do a game configuration before going into the game. | Дивна річ ця пам’ять. У моїх спогадах, Психлікарня відповідала на 85% тому, що я побачив під час цього перепроходження, але враження та емоції були геть інші. Так вийшло, що перше знайомство відбулося з Arkham City, бо на той момент якраз була куплена нова відеокарта, а друг казав, що ця гра виглядає неймовірно й дуже вибаглива. Тож нереально приємно провівши час, десь за рік взявся за Asylum і по відчуттям, це було наче після Темного лицаря дивитися Бетмен: Початок. І те, і те – гарні фільмі, і те, і те – круті ігри, але коли вже побачив щось краще в тому ж усесвіті зі своїми правилами й механіками, початкові варіанти сприймаються звісно ж слабше. Проте, на момент написання рецензії, це відчуття недорозвинених ідей чи аспектів не повернулося, тому ще в першу ігрову сесію завершив проєкт на 33%, провівши з двома хвилинними перервами 7 годин.

Сюжет простий і зрозумілий, подиву викликати не має, хіба що в людей, які не знають хто такий Брюс Вейн. Починається все з того, що Джокер без проблем віддається в руки Бетмену й вони прямують у лікарню. Уже всередині закладу протагоніста не полишає думка, що це якийсь підступний план – звісно ж так і є. Поганець виривається на свободу й випускає різних суперзлочинців та хуліганів, які мають якомога довше затримувати Темного лицаря, щоб його супротивник міг утілювати свій підступний задум. Звісно ж під час проходження ми зустрінемо фан-сервіс… вибачте, усім знайомих ворогів – Страхопудала, Бейна, Плюща тощо. Я радий, що це відбулося, проте до них майже відсутнє якесь сценарне підведення (окрім Бейна, хіба що): вони виникають на нашому шляху й хочуть надавати кажану по вухах. Якщо перемішати їх місцями, зміни будуть незначні, а для загального бачення картини взагалі відсутні. Фінал теж доволі посередній, а порівнювати з Arkham City взагалі не варто – там у мене відвисла щелепа, а тут непоганий мордобій і все: відчуття наче це кінець сезону, а далі буде наступний.

Стосовно мордобою. Я не цікавився чи це оригінальна ідея, чи десь підгледіли, але саме в серії Arkham я вперше побачив цю систему вибивання всього лaйнa із супротивників. Першу серію ударів Бетмен робить звичайні, а на кожний наступний удар нокаутує ворога на короткий проміжок часу, а гравцю треба лише вчасно тиснути удар, щоб протагоніст з певною анімацією сам підлітав до найближчої пики в напрямку камери – виглядає досі бомбезно й спроби повторити так і не перевершили Rocksteady Studios. Є ухилення в сторону чи через когось, але повністю відсутній блок, тому для вдалого перехоплення атаки треба в таймінг тиснути контрудар – інакше комбо буде збито, а наш герой отримає шкоду. Може на словах це якась 2-3-кнопочна боївка (що так і є, хе-хе), але на практиці купа поганців може швидко обламати кажану крильця, не кажучи вже про те, як круто виглядає битва без пропущених ударів. До речі, на високій складності, яку я вибрав, над головою хуліганів відсутній індикатор, тому треба самому уважно дивитися хто коли б’є.

Щодо іншого ігрового процесу, то це метроїдванія без необхідності в примусовому порядку йти в попередні локації та потрапляти в раніше закриті зони через відсутність певних ґаджетів. Окрім декодера, для якого Бетмен використав спеціальну картку, трохи дивно спостерігати за тим, як він свої ж інструменти не носить із собою, а бере тільки в певний момент. Деякі, як от подвійний бетаранг, можна отримати лише в меню прокачки. За різні дії, знаходження секретів, набивання великих комбо видають досвід, який підвищує рівень. За кожний можна вибрати будь-яке одне відкрите покращення: асортимент невеликий, це або посилення фізичних ударів і збільшення здоров’я, чи просто розширення можливостей вищезгаданих ґаджетів, що загалом не є необхідним по сюжету, а слугує задля колекціонування.

Так, ніхто нікого не змушує кудись там іти, але ж самому хочеться, і це великий плюс. Територія лікарні невелика, але в різних закутках і не дуже знаходяться аудіозаписи сеансів з місцевими пацієнтами, що складає певне враження про їхній характер чи хід думок. На локаціях можна знайти купу щелеп Джокера, які направляють гравця на основний шлях: їх знищення дає досвід і відкриває загадки Ріддлера (я його буду так звати, бо український варіант – Загадник – мені якось не до вподоби). Окрім цього, він розкидав фігурки знаків питання, більшість з яких потребує саме прокачаних ґаджетів. Звісно ж не обійшлося без загадок: у більшості кімнат треба знайти щось, що є відповіддю на них. Для цього необхідно використати унікальну механіку детектива: Бетмен починає бачити все навколо в рентгені з підсвідкою об’єктів та інформацією щодо оточення; якщо затиснути клавішу, то відбувається аналіз, а при влучному наведенні – загадка відмічається як розгадана. Усього їх 240, тому вистачить усім. У нагороду відкриються спеціальні випробування та моделі персонажів у головному меню.

Повертаючись до вражень. У ті часи я грав як є, головне, щоб був текстовий переклад, а якщо в меню не можна було змінити озвучення, то я не шукав способів зробити це інакше. Але, Asylum була після City, тому мені не вистачало тих самих голосів. А на озвучення трьох головних ролей тут узяли найкращих – голоси з мультсеріалу 1992-1995 рр, які не тільки для мене є ідеальними для своїх персонажів – Кевін Конрой у ролі Бетмена, Марк Гемміл у ролі Джокера, Арілін Соркін у ролі Гарлі Квінн. Ніякий Крістіан Бейл, Гіт Леджер, Марґо Роббі їм не рівня. Комісара Ґордона озвучує Том Кейн, який теж професіонал, але трохи не той Джим, якого голосом грав Боб Гейстінгз, проте й роль тут невелика. Відчутним мінусом є сама якість цих реплік: на тлі чіткого саундтреку, фрази звучать так, наче звук стиснено заради економії місця; гадаю десь на студії лежать оригінали, але їх ми ніколи не почуємо, якщо не випустять раптовий ремастер, як це сталося з Quake II, де нам надали можливість грати з lossless-треками.

Щодо технологічної частини, то тут усе складно. З однієї сторони гра 2009 року, тому очікувати щось не варто, але з іншої, того ж року вийшла Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, що тоді було просто «вау». Ще можна згадати м’ясну Prototype, Assassin's Creed II з деталізованим оточенням, Left 4 Dead 2 з гарними анімаціями облич, Red Faction: Guerrilla з проривною фізикою. Загалом, Бетмен погано зберігся: текстури страшнуваті, персонажі просто відкривають рот з мертвим виразом обличчя, модельки якісь трохи широкі й непропорційні, купа дверей з підвантаженням, пререндерені ролики низької якості, загальне відчуття низької частоти кадрів через анімації руху, зроблені з низьким fps, шрифти субтитрів не масштабуються після Full HD тощо.

У моєму профілі можна подивитися скріншоти як виглядатиме. Я встановлював Asylum Reborn, який іде одразу з оновленим лаунчером; AsylumHD та Asylum 4K. Що це дає? Текстури на всіх поверхнях і моделях матимуть якісний оновлений вигляд та разом з катсценами будуть у 4k. Покращений запускач дасть змогу без проблем вибрати будь-яку роздільну здатність і надасть доступ до недоступних у стандартній версії параметрів, включно з тими, які активують моди. Вбудована технологія NVIDIA PhysX працюватиме належним чином і в повну силу, що не тільки надасть фізичну модель кожному папірцю в частих стосах, але й усі цеглини чи інші предмети взіємодіятимуть з моделями: особливо круто на вулиці ходити й розкидувати листя на підлозі. Єдине місце, де всі ці покращення можуть навантажити систему, це сутичка зі Страхопудалом, де на екрані сотні маленьких об’єктів, що лікується сучасним залізом або середніми налаштуваннями PhysX.

Якщо ні, то я не знаю навіщо фанат Kingdome Come читає цю рецензію. | It is a great beginning to the Arkhamverse. I loved it when I first played it on the console, and it still holds up all these years later. It's a shame that the same can't be said about Rocksteady | До цього часу не грав в жодну частину Batman. Навіть жодного ролику чи огляду не бачив.  Гра мене здивувала своєю простотою та якістю. Навіть зараз ця гра виглядає достойно. 
Світ створений в темних тонах, все в стилі DC. Легкий та зрозумілий сюжет. Доволі велика, умовно, відкрита карта. Бо в деякі місця можливо дістатися пройшовши по сюжету і отримавши нові гаджети.  
Якісно озвучені герої. Відчувається їхнє безумство та психологічний розлад.  Їхній біографічний опис повністю втілений в гру їхніми діями.  Намальовані вони також прикольно. Особливо Джокер у фінальному файті. Я прям кайфанув від його вигляду.
І так...!!!м  Самий мед, сама насолода в грі - це бойова механіка. Ти ніби створюєш музичний твір набираючи більше комбо в такт натиснутими клавішами. Кожен бій можна виграти по різному. Любиш прямий контакти - то в перед, головне вирубити першим того хто із зброєю. А можна діяти, як справжній хижак. Полювати на кожного окремо. Так круто спостерігати за панікою тих ворогів, що залишаються живими. Їхнє серцебиття частішає, уважність стає меншою і як наслідок - неминучий, тихий нокаут.
Цю гру варто спробувати тому хто в неї не грав. І можна зіграти між сесіями нинішнього конвеєрного ігро-світу. Однозначно рекомендую! | great linear cinematic game. the art direction is beautiful and the claustrophobic disturbing atmosphere of the asylum is great. plot is intriguing as it sets in a narrow period between a clearly long, filled past and questions of what could come after it.  interactive storytelling is professional as i felt like the game knew what i would think and where i would go as an impulse, numerous times. combat is fluent and enjoyable. batman's body shape is goofy af. definitely recommend it and the games came after it, the quality just gets better like a snowball with each game of the series."
76561197970569635,29180,Osmos,8.533333333333333,"Casual, Indie",3,"Osmos is a game that admittedly is somewhat special to me, in light that it was one of the items acquired for the still-deemed-to-be-almost-completely-insignificant 8th Grade Graduation event in 2010, yet also a completely baffling, confounding, fundamentally broken experience.

I haven't the foggiest of clues how literally [b]anyone[/b] could try to play through 2 of the three level branches in-game, and not only deem it a [b]finished product[/b] that's ready to send to market, but also charge $10 for it. Similarly, I very much want to know which game everybody that pushed its Metacritic Score up to [b]EIGHTY[/b] was playing, and/or how much of it was done so before passing judgement.

To delve into what's wrong with this slow, plodding, almost-entirely-unengaging disaster, I first need to have you, dear reader, imagine you're playing literally any game with a level (style of game doesn't matter), and end goal for said stage. 

Now imagine that instead of making sure you have even the [b]chance[/b] of [b]starting to play[/b] this level, you instead need to repeatedly pause and generate a new map to make sure the game bothers giving you collision to stand on, then literally anything else that's needed to clear said stage.

I would say “This is at least two levels in Osmos”, however, this analogy is not over, because even if the game you're imagining gives you a starting piece of terrain, allows you to move within it, and grants you the equipment needed to have a chance at beating the stage, no guarantee exists the end goal was generated alongside it, 

This is to say that after spending sometimes up to 10 minutes trying to beat this stage, you can be at the second to last action needed to fulfil the objective, only to find the switch you needed to push, unit you needed to spawn, and/or edge of the platform you need to jump from to get to the goal is completely missing.

Guess what this means you need to do? Keep generating a new map until the basics are granted, then hope the game gave you a complete level that can finished this time around.

[b][u]This is to say that levels in Osmos are not designed, they're generated, and not only that, seemingly nothing by any flags, checks, or programs are in-place to make sure said stage can be completed was bothered to be programmed[/u][/b], making the gameplay loop “play until you get stuck on a level, regenerate said level until you can even start to play it, and hope that the system blessed you with the apparently unheard-of privilege of being able to beat said stage.

I have gone back to this game at least twice since acquiring it almost 15 years ago, and each time, I reached a “level” that's not only entirely reliant on RNG to be able to not only do anything at-all in, but seemingly completely unable to be finished.

The first revisit saw one of the “Force” clusters be perpetually beyond even beginning, and while the A3B cluster seemed doable at first, after – no joke – at least 30 restarts, 1 hour and a half wasted, and only 15 that I wasn't completely blocked out of doing anything with, none of those were finished.

It gets worse, though, because in order to have a chance at defeating any enemy (in this case stationary blobs for most of the levels I bothered even trying to play) you – so to speak – need to take health from yourself, and give it to whichever adversary you may be facing. This already sounds completely unreasonable, but once you assimilate the “Health” of the other enemy, you grow to their size, unable to get through corridors, and use weaker ones to hope to try and beat the bigger ones, while hoping beyond hope nothing happens to give imperative health to your adversary, causing it to grow bigger, and completely block you off from progressing.

[b][u]The fundamental laws of game design state:[/u][/b]

1: If you must have a randomiser take the place of intentional design, include checks, and flags, then redundancy on redundancy to make sure every level can be completed via player agency, and skill, rather than the randomiser putting everything in.

2: Once these are in-place, make absolutely sure that everything it makes can be consistently completed, playing each level multiple times, and perhaps have multiple people also do so, to increase the amount of tested instances/generations.

3: Once everything is confirmed to be working [b][u]then[/u][/b] publish it.

As such, we reach the

[b][u]Verdict:[/u][/b] A seemingly-untested, unfinished-feeling frustration-fest that relies entirely on luck to allow the player to do anything, with two levels either taking hours of restarts to beat, or otherwise are completely impossible to finish.

[b][u]Placed In:[/u][/b] Were this acquired on any other occasion, I would have 0 qualms whatsoever about ousting it from my account such that I never have the temptation to be disappointed by it in the future again, but as it stands, it's shakily at 6: Traumatically Toxic, and “Remove it anyway.” | Klassiker"
76561197970569635,37800,Quantz,0.0,"Indie, Casual",0,"I've had this game for a while and only recently picked it back up. It's a pretty cool concept and a nice brain exercise for puzzle lovers (not to mention addictive as hell). One big issue, though, is that transition sequences have blindingly bright, totally unnecessary flashing light animations. I have to play this game with my monitor on the lowest brightness setting--otherwise it gives me a migraine. | The music is good, but the game play is an absolute mess.

It's too easy to make marbles move when you don't want them to.

Also, both holding the left mouse button can 'freeze' time as well as launch a marble, making it very easily to fire a marble in the wrong place, thus failing a puzzle quickly. The right mouse button does the SAME thing. Not sure why they couldn't fix this by just holding right mouse to freeze time, and left click to launch marbles.

There also doesn't seem to be any solution guides to all of the puzzles, so if you get stuck, game over. :\

Maybe the developers can do some kind of rare update to fix the issues, but I have doubts about it happening.

I can't really recommend this game. There are much better puzzle games out there with better controls. | This game is sort of interesting, but...If you are a heavy puzzle fan who must play everything, go for it, but, I warn you, you've probably seen this before. If you aren't...find a better version. This is a 3d puzzle in which colored pieces drop onto the field while you spin the field so the pieces land on a group of like colored spheres, which will then explode. Detonate a group surrounding another colored piece, and that piece will explode upward and then drop, burning away like colored spheres, and possibly causing more explosions. Quantz's one unique feature is that your pieces are mostly free moving. Shake the field and the pieces move. Shake hard, and everything goes flying, before resettling into a (hopefully) better position. For a puzzle game, Quantz is pretty easy. The only time I've ever failed a stage was I tried to do something fancy, and ignored my timer. | QuantZ isn't bad, and has some surprising plus points. Visually the game has aged remarkably well, slowdown on some transitions aside, and the audio is pleasant, if repetitive. In fact, 'pleasant but repetitve' sum this puzzle game up quite neatly. It has a decent amount of content for a puzzler, is easy to pick up and play, and has a fairly interesting premise. It just gets dull too swiftly.

The idea is to fling coloured balls down towards a cube that you can rotate at will - a match game with the twist that you can reposition the balls already in play by spinning the cube. This sounds good, and you can do some bizarre and wacky things with the physics, but in practice you're cracking a nut with a sledgehammer. The game was designed for a touchscreen, and it's difficult to finesse individual spheres about the place; mostly you'll resort to flailing the cube wildly and hoping that everything resettles in a more favourable configuration. There are other gimmicks to spice up gameplay, but the tried-and-tested formula is always present.

I spent a decent amount of time with the game, and found that although Action and Strategy modes both have twelve distinct worlds, they may as well be the same game mode. You'll very rarely run out of time or balls in the latter, so you can treat it in the same manner as you would the former. I blitzed through the Action section and had a decent time of it, but things got stale pretty sharpish. The Puzzle mode consists of preset playing fields with a very low number of balls to play with...you'll have to caress them with a delicate touch, and complete the eruptions in as few strokes as possible. Ahem. It was a welcome distraction, but ultimately when things got difficult (and some of the achievements are absolutely dastardly), I found myself wondering why I was still playing.

2009 wasn't exactly an eon ago, but in terms of games on Steam it's about as ancient as the Steam Age itself. QuantZ was probably facing a less cluttered puzzle field back then; nowadays, with so many other options available, I can't recommend a game this limited. | [quote][b]W A R N I N G[/b][/quote]

Pros:

- You automatically collect the ammo
- There's an in-game map
- You can use modern resolutions

Cons: 

- No bugs were fixed:  Enemies still fall through the map, pathfinding 100 % broken for AI etc.
- New bugs added: Moxxi Underdome music disappears whenever it feels like it, never addressed. 
- You STILL need to edit .ini file to remove mouse acceleration. Some QoL changes that are possible to change from. ini, crash the game
- There's a memory leak that was never fixed, no matter how much community tried to raise the issue
- Randy Pitchford is still in charge
- Borderlands 4, despite all the half-assed stuff in the remaster is advertised in the main menu like a mobile game pop-up and is the only thing that 100 % works in this case.

There is plenty issues with this Version as well,
- Once You've been in 1 Session for long, it starts becoming laggy mess - At some point You are most likely to Re-start Your game, load up Your save and continue.
- In Co-op / Multiplayer there been issues with the Minimap as well, sometimes it's just doesn't load in For Co-op / Multiplayer player(s) - Stays black in few maps.
- Game randomly likes to put Custom Waypoints everytime and everywhere. 
- Mission waypoints might be bugged for other player(s) in Your game sessions - Luckly fine for Host.
- Few smaller things as well. | A great action rpg.It is difficult early on but once you start doing side quests/optional missions it becomes fairly easy.

I've played a lot of ARPGs in my time and this game just isn't good, not with the lots of other games there are nowadays and that were there even during its time. I didn't go into it with wanting to dislike it, but have not really found many things to like, or at the very least enough for me to like the game, enjoy my experience, and give it a positive review.

I'm not a fan of the graphics, but that's always been the least important aspect when it comes to games for me, but I can't believe this game is from 2009 judging from... well, everything. The graphics didn't age well (looks like a cheap mobile game), amount of classes (3?!), mechanics, skills and skill trees (every class has 15 active and 15 passive skills), loot (a lot of trash drops) and the controls and combat - very clunky, I tried playing a Vanquisher (kind of a Rogue/Marksman class) and the ranged attacks usually either didn't even connect or only had range for about half the screen.

I'd have expected the game to be at least 10 years older than that, everything just feels so lackluster and jank for its time. If it were, I wouldn't have been so harsh with the review but simply put, there were games that were miles ahead at the time - Titan Quest or Diablo II, which lo and behold, are still very good and playable to this day, even in spite of being older.

There are some nice ideas, like the pet, being able to send it back to town to sell your items. If only the inventory wasn't 3x7, while also having to carry scrolls and potions, making it at least 4 slots smaller. Other than that though, the pet is just basically a way worse and dumbed-down version of the Diablo II mercenary. The only other ""good"" thing about the game is that you can mod it and the mods don't disable steam achievements, at least the ones I installed. This would be good if the base game itself was good and if some mods just didn't feel mandatory to make the experience less painful.

Now if we move on to the cons, other than everything already mentioned above, there is no respec, why? Yes, there is a mod for it, but still. There were games before its time that had this mechanic, so why does this game not have it?

I am playing in very hard softcore and the game still feels very easy regardless of that, which brings me to the balance being very poor - still remember my first death, which was to a trapped chest dealing over 50% of my health in a zone 5 levels below me, while literally every single other trap I've triggered dealt about 1/10 of the damage of this one, pretty much not even moving my health bar. I just don't get it. On top of that, the monster damage on very hard gets absurd very quickly, even before completing the story you're gonna start getting constantly oneshot with very little counterplay, unless you're of course kiting around half the map and standing half a screen away from the mobs.

This game didn't bring anything new at the time that would be meaningful and worthwhile enough to mention. Unless you're going into the game with extremely strong nostalgia, can't recommend. It is cheap though, so I'll at least give it that. | . São 3 personagens fixos e sem nome, não tem como customizar a aparência, cada um é uma classe diferente.

I love this game. I used to play it on my low spec netbook that struggled even running chrome, it ran this game well. There are a ton of better ARPGs out there, but none of them are as ""minimalist"" as this one. Single dungeon with multiple levels, basic classes and skills, small town with quest givers. It is a bare bones ARPG and that is not necessarily a bad thing. Not having to stress over synergies (non existent) complex skill trees (as basic as they come) makes this game perhaps the coziest ARPG out there.

In Overlord 2, you will try out the role of the new Dark Lord, with whom you will set out to plunder the land and spread evil. Mainly with the help of your chatty and tireless goblin minions.

From the cold glacial cave, your heavy steps will lead you through snowy gorges and along the way you will sow destruction and death around you. Then comes the tropical land of the annoying marijuana elves and their annoying dances. We will also go to the underworld to the dark land of the old, already defeated dark lord. And finally, we will go to massacre the land of our archenemy - the Roman Empire led by Emperor Solarius.
The game takes place in relatively large levels, which are visually very variable and offer constant enjoyment. Although it is a more or less linear experience, it at least gives a sense of freedom.

 | The game also comes with a DLC, which includes the following items:

1. A Toxic Community: Mistakes are rarely forgiven. Unless you’re playing with friends, be prepared to face harsh criticism, often from younger players. The game’s multiplayer is largely populated by school-aged players who don’t hold back.


2. Disruptive Adults: It’s not just the kids causing chaos—some adults blast music through their microphones, assuming everyone else shares their taste. Spoiler: they don’t.


3. Frequent AFKs: Teamwork can fall apart when a teammate goes inactive, whether they’re brewing tea, taking a smoke break, or simply wandering off mid-game. And yes, it often happens right after you’ve generously used your first aid kit on them.


4. Team Abandonment: Lone wolves running off to the far corners of the map, only to be overwhelmed by infected, are a common sight. They’re quick to flood the chat with colorful language before rage-quitting the game.


5. Difficulty Disputes: Some players join games on ""Expert"" difficulty only to demand a downgrade. If their request is denied, they might sabotage the team before leaving the server entirely.


6. Vote Kicks: Occasionally, you’ll encounter players who inexplicably start a vote to kick you from the game. When you ask why? Crickets.



The Verdict: Despite the chaotic community, Left 4 Dead 2 remains a phenomenal experience. The graphics are a significant step up from the first game, the mechanics feel more polished, and there’s a greater variety of weapons and infected to enjoy. However, surviving the online experience without a calming remedy might be just as challenging as surviving the zombie apocalypse itself. | [h1]写了800字的推荐文，手欠点了一下""否""全没了。不说了血压高了,头晕。[/h1]总之就是《关于一个萌新GMOD玩久了无聊直接去玩L4D1多人因太菜反复被僵尸虐而被队友抛弃伤心自责卸载游戏过半年好奇进L4D2知道玩单人熟悉官图及玩法过程中发现了能打MOD结果一发不可收拾地搜各种进阶攻略教程提升自己游戏体验和能力努力不坑队友可仍然很菜但是很感谢带萌新入坑的朋友们以及创意工坊的大佬们给这游戏第二次生命的事》 | Крутая игра для игры с друзьями (которые в это не играют)! Есть редкие достижения, куча пушек и толпа зомби, которая будет медленно наступать на пятки и их съедать. В общем, весело, рекомендую. | Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D2), released by Valve in 2009, is the gold standard for cooperative zombie shooters. Featuring intense survival gameplay, smart AI, and an incredible atmosphere, L4D2 delivers an unmatched multiplayer experience. With its fast-paced action, diverse weapons, and unpredictable enemy encounters, this game remains one of the most thrilling and replayable co-op shooters ever made.

Gameplay – Pure, Adrenaline-Fueled Action
L4D2 is all about co-op survival. You and three teammates must fight through hordes of the undead, navigating through various maps and completing objectives to reach safety. The key to survival? Teamwork, strategy, and adaptability.

The gunplay is tight and satisfying, with a wide selection of weapons including assault rifles, shotguns, SMGs, sniper rifles, and melee weapons like axes, katanas, and even frying pans! Every encounter feels dynamic, thanks to the AI Director, which adjusts the difficulty based on your team’s performance, ensuring no two playthroughs are ever the same.

Special Infected – Enemies That Keep You on Edge
Beyond the standard zombie horde, L4D2 introduces Special Infected that force players to work together:

Tank – A massive brute that can throw debris and crush survivors.
Witch – A terrifying enemy that, if startled, can instantly incapacitate a survivor.
Smoker – Uses a long tongue to drag players away from their team.
Hunter – A fast, agile infected that pounces on survivors and pins them down.
Boomer – Explodes in a shower of bile, attracting a massive horde.
Charger – Charges through groups, slamming a survivor into the ground.
Spitter – Creates pools of acid that deal heavy damage.
Each Special Infected forces different team strategies, making communication and positioning absolutely crucial.

Campaigns & Maps – A Horror Movie Experience
L4D2 features multiple campaigns, each set in diverse, apocalyptic locations across the southern U.S.:

Dead Center – A chaotic mall escape reminiscent of classic zombie films.
The Parish – A tense race across New Orleans to reach an evacuation zone.
Swamp Fever – A creepy, foggy swamp filled with infected dangers.
Hard Rain – A unique campaign featuring a devastating hurricane that changes the environment.
Dark Carnival – A fan-favorite, featuring a deadly amusement park with a thrilling rollercoaster finale.
Each campaign feels like a mini zombie movie, packed with cinematic set pieces, interactive environments, and intense finales.

Multiplayer & Game Modes – Endless Replayability
L4D2 offers several game modes that keep the action fresh:

Campaign Mode – Classic co-op survival through story-driven levels.
Versus Mode – One team plays as survivors, while the other controls the Special Infected.
Survival Mode – See how long you can last against endless waves of zombies.
Scavenge Mode – A competitive mode where teams race to collect fuel cans while being hunted.
Mutation Mode – Weekly game modifiers that add fun twists to gameplay.
Thanks to modding support and the Steam Workshop, the community has also created hundreds of custom maps, weapons, and campaigns, making L4D2’s replayability practically infinite.

Graphics & Sound – Immersive and Timeless
Even years after release, L4D2’s atmospheric lighting, detailed environments, and gruesome effects hold up well. Zombies react realistically to gunfire, and the sound design is masterful, with eerie background noises, terrifying growls from Special Infected, and intense musical cues that heighten the suspense.

The voice acting and character interactions bring the survivors to life, making them memorable and adding humor to the chaos.

Why Left 4 Dead 2 is a Must-Play
L4D2 is the perfect blend of action, horror, and co-op gameplay. Whether you’re playing with friends or AI teammates, the intense combat, unpredictable enemy encounters, and endless replayability make every match a thrilling adventure.

🔹 Final Rating: 10/10
Left 4 Dead 2 is a masterpiece of cooperative gaming. If you love zombies, action, and teamwork, this is an absolute must-play that still delivers endless fun and excitement after more than a decade.

76561197970569635,8850,BioShock® 2,7.95,Action,0,"To put simply: my favorite video game of all time.

The first Bioshock is a great game, but it isn’t perfect. It suffers from odd level design and a messy final act. But despite its short development time, Bioshock 2 takes everything great about the first game and streamlines it. Gone are the old PC-era RPG elements and bullet-spongy bosses. The way research works in this game promotes more variety in gunplay, pushing players to try plasmid and weapon combos they might normally not. This makes 2 extremely replayable.

The story here elaborates on a small but important part of Bioshock: the Big Daddies and Little Sisters. Putting you in the shoes of an “old-school” Daddy that supposedly existed before the events of the first game, Delta somehow manages to help us feel so much more than Jack ever did.

Our relationship with Eleanor is moving and organic. Lamb feels like a great successor villain-wise to the loud and proud Ryan. Bioshock 2's story is weirdly similar to Neon Genesis Evangelion, but with a Socialism-fearing American twist. Through themes of fatherhood battling unrighteous use of equality and unity, our actions feel much more fleshed out than the black-and-white “choice” in Bioshock (which is ironic considering that game’s main message). This game makes your choices feel like they really matter.

2 abandons a plot twist and a final boss to focus more on its spectrum of endings, which feel natural based on our choices and their influence. If Delta is good, Eleanor becomes good. If Delta is evil, Eleanor becomes evil. If Delta made mixed/nonsensical choices, Eleanor becomes broken and confused. This is especially great with how thought-provoking some of the choices are: like does Gil deserve to live, or should he be mercy-killed as he previously asked? Not to forget the Mark Meltzer subplot, which is its own whole fascinating journey that was originally revealed through an ARG before 2 released.

The multiplayer is pretty great despite how often people cite it as feeling ""tacked on."" Clearly a decent amount of love was put into it, even if it is unbalanced (all you need is Electro Bolt and the damage-upgraded crossbow).

This was my first Bioshock game, but I think even if I had played the first game first, I’d know that this is the better game. And probably the greatest shooter of all time."" Love is just a chemical, we give it meaning by choice."" Wild that some people think this story is weaker... | Great game but even worse port than the first one. INI tweaks should not be necessary to run without constant crashing. | Fantástico! Bioshock 2 é uma sequência muito mais que digna do primeiro jogo, além de dar um upgrade na jogabilidade, continua a entregar um enredo envolvente com uma história profunda e que levanta reflexões desta vez mostrando o outro extremo, contrário ao ideal individualista de Andrew Ryan. Sophia Lamb não é uma vilã tão marcante quanto o Andrew, mas exerce o seu papel muito bem, trazendo à tona a loucura que é a busca por uma coletividade absoluta. É uma lei universal, é uma característica intrínseca à toda sociedade: todo extremismo produz inevitavelmente um outro extremismo contrário a si mesmo.

(o jogo tem bug que faz ele fechar sozinho em determinado ponto, então antes de começar a jogar procure um tutorial no YT pra resolver logo e não passar estresse, é simples de resolver. | This game has insane storyline and a really good enviromental storytelling. A must play for those who finished the first game and a good game to enjoy. | Гра дуже цікава, великий вибір кастомізації зброї. Також хочеться відмітити що гра складна, навіть на легкій складності вороги будуть вбивати за кілька ударів."
76561197970569635,409720,BioShock™ 2 Remastered,0.0,"Action, RPG",0,"[h1] Devam oyunu dediğin böyle olur [/h1]

Serinin ilk oyununu bitirdikten sonra devamında nasıl bir bağlantı var diye merak ediyordum. Bu oyunda tekrardan Rapture'ın derinliklerine yolculuk yapıyoruz. Yani aslında yolculuk yapmıyoruz rapture'ın içerisinde başlıyoruz. İlk oyunu bıraktığımız yerden devam ediyoruz dersek yanlış olmaz. Görsel ve teknik güncellemeler, iyileştirmeler sayesinde hikayeyi daha güzel ve detaylı tanıyoruz. Hikayenin daha fazla derinliklerine iniyoruz.

[h3] Hikaye ve Arka Plan:[/h3]
İlk oyunda, Jack olarak Rapture'ın korkunç sırlarını ortaya çıkarırken Andrew ve Fontaine gibi güçlü karakterleri ortadan kaldırmıştık. Bioshock 2'de ise bu yaşanan olayların üzerinden yaklaşık 8 yıl geçmiş bulunmakta. Hangi yıllarda oynadığımızı oyunların başlarında gösteriyordu dikkat edenler bunu fark etmiştir. Şaşırdığım ve aşırı mutlu eden şey ise bu oyunda bir '' Big Daddy '' olan Deltayı kontrol ediyoruz. Yani ana karakterimiz Big Daddy olan Delta. İkinci oyunun hikayesi birinci oyuna göre daha kişisel bir hikaye. Çünkü asıl amacımız Little Sister olan Eleanor'u korumak ve kurtarmak.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3410322464
Hikaye, Sophia Lamb adında bir antagonist ile şekilleniyor. Benim gözümde kendisi yine kendini bilmez ilk oyunun boss'larına benziyor. Kendi hedefi için gerekirse Rapture'u yok edebilecek birisinden bahsediyoruz. Böyle diyince aklıma Griffith'i getirdi :d. Lamb, Ryan'ın bireycilik odaklı felsefesinin tam zıttı bir anlayışı savunuyor. Topluluk odaklı bir ideolojiyi benimsiyor. Ama bunu yaparken dediğim gibi her zaman kendi önceliğini düşünüyor. Topluluk ideolojisi adı altında onun için çalışanlara biz aileyiz vesaire şeklinde konuşup askerlerinin fedakarlık yapmasını istiyor. Manipüleci birisi olduğunu da unutmayalım.

[h3] Hikaye'nin Derinliği: [/h3]
Yukarıda da bahsettiğim gibi, ikinci oyunun hikayesi daha kişisel ve daha duygusal bir temele dayanıyor. Eleanor ile olan bağımız, oyun boyunca hissettiriliyor. Hem hikaye hem de oynanış açısından karakterimizi motivasyon ediyor. Tabii bazı yerler için oyuncuyu da motive ediyor. Sophia Lamb'ın ideolojisi ve eylemleri, Ryan'ın bireycilik felsefesine derin bir tezat oluşturuyor. Bence bu önemli ve hikayeye derinlik katan bir unsur.

Ve en güzel kısımlardan birisi. Oyunda verdiğimiz kararlar Eleanor'un kaderini değiştiriyor. İnsanları öldürecek miyiz yoksa affedecek miyiz ? Aynı şekilde Little Sister'ları hasat mı edicez yoksa kurtarıcaz mı. Bunların hepsi oyuncuya kalmış ve böyle şeylerin oyunu etkilediğini de unutmamak lazım. Verdiğimiz kararlar Eleanor'un etik kararlarını sorgulamasına neden oluyor. Hem kişisel hem de toplumsal temalar işlendiği için, bioshock serisinin felsefi derinliği bu oyunda da devam ediyor.

[h3] Ses Tasarımı: [/h3]
İlk oyunda olduğu gibi bu oyunda da ses tasarımı, atmosfer yaratımında yine harikalar yaratıyor. Big Daddy'nin duyulan adım sesleri, dalgaların derinden gelen yankıları, splicer'ların diyalogları, çıkarttığı sesler, ana ve yan karakterlerin tepkileri ve konuşmaları olsun tatmin ediyor. İlk oyuna kıyasla ses tasarımında daha derin bir ambiyans hissediliyor. Yani ilk oyundan 8 yıl sonra geçtiği için Rapture'ın çürüyen altyapısını daha iyi hissediyoruz. Bu konuda tabii ki su sızıntıları ve mekanik bozulmalar gibi şeyler hikayeyi destekleyen detaylardan birisi.

Ek olarak Garry Schyman'ın bestelediği müzikler yine oyunun en büyük artılarından biri.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3410403327
[h3] Grafikler: [/h3]
Remastered sürüm olduğunu unutmamak lazım. Eski oyunun grafiklerini modern standartlara yakınlaştırmayı başarabilen bir remastered. İlk oyuna kıyasla dokular ve tasarımlar daha net. Işıklandırma efektleri ve çevre tasarımları daha detaylı. Akvaryum benzeri alanlarda gezinirken suyun yarattığı parlaklıkları ve kırılmaları görmek güzel. Kısaca grafiksel geliştirmeler oyun için yeterli ve oyunun atmosferine büyük bir katkı sağlıyor.

[h3] Skill Sistemi:[/h3]
İlk oyundan Plasmid'leri hatırlıyoruz. Devam oyununda ise bu sistemin geliştirilmiş bir halini kullanıyoruz. Yeni plasmid'ler ve eski favorilerin geliştirilmiş versiyonları savaşlarda daha fazla stratejik derinlik sunuyor. Big Daddy olarak kullanabileceğimiz silahları, Plasmid'ler ile eşzamanlı kullanma imkanı oyuna farklı bir hava katıyor. Kısaca skill sistemi ve mekanikler sayesinde savaşlar hala çok zevkli.

[h3] Kontroller ve Mekanikler: [/h3]
Hazır mekanikler demişken bu konuya da değinelim. Oyunda Big Daddy olarak oynamak sadece görsel olarak bir değişiklik sunmuyor. Oynanış mekaniğini de doğrudan etkiliyor. Delta olarak daha güçlü, daha dayanıklı ve daha donanımlıyız. En basiti oyunun başından da anlayabileceğimiz gibi Big Daddy'e özel bir silah ile başlıyoruz. Daha güçlü olduğumuz için de savaşırken biraz daha cesur davranabiliyoruz. Kontroller de ilk oyundaki gibi akıcı ve günümüze optimize edilmiş.

Ek olarak oyunun sonlarına doğru Little Sister'ların dünyayı nasıl gördüğünü göstermeleri efsane olmuş. Little Sister olarak kısa bir süreliğine oynuyoruz.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3410402849
[h3] Düşman Çeşitliliği: [/h3]
Yani düşman çeşitliliği ilk oyuna benzer ama biraz daha değiştirilmiş ve geliştirilmiş versiyonları bizleri karşılıyor. Splicer'lar yine ana tehdit unsurlarından birisi. Ancak bu sefer oyunda Big Sister dediğimiz başka bir düşman türüyle de tanışıyoruz. Big Sister adından da anlaşıldığı gibi Big Daddy'nin kadın versiyonu. Ancak Big Daddy kadar ağır olmak yerine daha hızlı ve daha ölümcül bir düşman. Çok daha çevik ve daha tehlikeli. Sadece bize doğru gelirken çıkarttığı ürkütücü ses bile farklı şeyler hissettiriyor. (Bağıra bağıra geliyor)

Ek olarak oyunun ilerisinde splicer'lar daha zorlayıcı oluyor. Plazmidlerimize karşı farklı savunma yöntemleri oluyor.


Sonuç olarak Bioshock 2 Remastered, ilk oyunun bıraktığı mirası başarılı bir şekilde sürdürüyor. Hatta bazı yönleriyle seriyi daha ileriye taşıyan bir yapım olmuş. Rapture'ın hikayesine yeni katmanlar eklerken, oynanış ve atmosfer açısından da etkileyici ve unutulmaz bir deneyim sunuyor. Geliştirilmiş görseller, daha duygusal ve derin bir hikaye sayesinde mükemmel bir yapım olmuş. Tabii ki bazı şeylerin aynı olması ve aynı yerde geçmesi bazı oyuncuları sıkacaktır ama ben hikayeyi sevdiğimden ve ilgi çekici bulduğumdan öyle bir problem yaşamadım.

Just get Forged Alliance. It's way better. | Weak recommend.

Its neat, but not as good as the original. Still probably worth it at the sorts of discounts it's been getting.

Theres a really big probolem: You have to pay resources upfront for everything. This does not sound bad on the face of it, but what this really means is that you issue a build order and it can sit in some hidden queue for 30 minutes/ unknown indeterminate time. Not quite how that queue works, but getting stuff you need done ASAP prioritised is a royal pain.
In Supreme commander 1 overdrawing on resources would slow down production, but you could still estimate when stuff got done and re-prioritize when neccessary.

Because its hard to estimate when anything gets done unless you float resources the default solution to everything is... turtle up, build deathball.. attack move, then force attack enemy commander. In the campaign, works 100% of the time.

Another problem is unit control. Pathfinding is not the best, Also units can wait around for reasons such as .. 1 unit is stlightly out of formation so eveybody must say perfectly still. Really messes with use of waypoints as your army randomly stops for long periods of time to reform a a different angle.

There is a unit cap. It looks like buildings also count, not just stuff that moves.
In large part the allure of Supreme Commander is the massive unit groups you can order around on a massive arena. Now feels like everything has been scaled back to a ""sensible"" scale. fewer units, less extreme experimental units.
Because there are fewer units you notice more how sluggish the unit control can be. | 这个是我小时候玩的第一款电脑游戏，也是陪伴我最久的游戏。当时最喜欢的就是打人机，憋两个小时军队然后去冲家。当时还误删过这个游戏，在逗游，3dm到处找盗版资源。但后来家里没电脑就没机会玩了。

Felizmente, Metro Redux consegue se diferenciar nesse sentido ao trazer ao mercado um valor de produção muito grande, ao mesmo tempo em que resgata experiências já um tanto quanto antigas. Usando a versão mais recente da 4A Engine, o pacote permite reviver as experiências de Metro 2033 e Metro Last Light com gráficos revitalizados e com uma jogabilidade mais refinada do que a vista nas versões originais.

Tivemos a oportunidade de conferir a remasterização na íntegra e, nesta análise, trazemos tudo aquilo que você precisa saber sobre ela. Além disso, aproveitamos para retornar aos lançamentos originais para conferir o quanto elas se diferenciam do novo trabalho feito pela 4A Games.


Um novo fôlego para a franquia:

A principal novidade de Metro Redux fica por conta do uso da versão mais recente da 4ª Engine, que já se mostra bem adaptada aos requisitos da nova geração de consoles. Na prática, isso se reflete em modelos tridimensionais com uma qualidade melhor, em um novo sistema de iluminação e em texturas com um nível maior de detalhes.

O maior beneficiado pelo novo motor gráfico é Metro 2033, lançado no já distante ano de 2010. Embora o game ainda possa ser considerado belo (especialmente no PC), o trabalho feito pelos desenvolvedores conseguiu trazer a ele um novo nível de qualidade — o que deve ajudar a justificar o retorno daqueles que já conferiram a versão original.

Além de adotar modelos de personagens com uma qualidade maior de detalhes, o game ganha texturas em alta resolução que permitem apreciar melhor a direção de arte da 4A Games. O título também traz monstros com um visual aprimorado e diversas adições às suas animações, o que garante uma maior naturalidade de movimentos tanto para personagens humanos quanto para as criaturas mutantes que você deve enfrentar.

Metro 2033 também ganhou algumas atualizações em suas mecânicas de jogo, adotando um sistema de controles idêntico àquele visto na sequência Last Light. Outro ponto que mostra a dedicação dos desenvolvedores a realmente fazer um trabalho de qualidade são as cenas de corte do jogo, que agora são reproduzidas exclusivamente em primeira pessoa — com direito a diversos momentos interativos.


Experiência que se sustenta:

O ponto que mais se destaca no conteúdo visto em Metro Redux é a maneira como a franquia continua parecendo “fresca”, mesmo que seu primeiro capítulo tenha sido lançado há quase meia década. Muito disso se deve à ambientação explorada pela 4A Games, que se assemelha muito mais a um game do gênero Survival Horror do que a um FPS convencional.

Talvez ciente de que nem todos os jogadores podem se interessar por um título com certas restrições, o estúdio decidiu criar dois estilos de jogabilidade: Survival e Spartan. Enquanto o primeiro reduz a quantidade de munições e armamentos que você encontra (o que torna a experiência mais assustadora), o segundo age como um “jogo de tiro convencional”, permitindo que você seja mais descuidado durante os combates.

Independente da opção que você escolher, a experiência básica de ambos os jogos se mantém impressionantemente sólida. Grande parte disso se deve à presença de adversários com uma boa inteligência artificial (que sofreu aprimoramentos notáveis na versão Redux, especialmente em Metro 2033) e também à maneira como os combates são construídos.


Vale a pena? Muito bom mesmo vale muito a pena !!!

Devemos ser bem sinceros: caso você já tenha finalizado Metro 2033 e Metro Last Light, a aquisição de Metro Redux não é exatamente necessária — afinal, por maiores que sejam as melhorias apresentadas, em essência os jogos permanecem idênticos. No entanto, quem não pôde conferir as experiências em sua época de lançamento (ou simplesmente quer revivê-las) não poderia pedir muito mais da remasterização.

Nesse sentido, surge como vantagem a possibilidade de poder adquirir as duas versões Redux de forma individual através do meio digital. Dessa maneira, você pode escolher somente o título que mais lhe interessa, deixando de lado aquele com qual já tem mais familiaridade — algo que, devemos admitir, deve prejudicar um pouco as vendas de Last Light em sua versão para PC.

Caso você simplesmente nunca tenha entrado no universo de Metro, essa é a melhor opção para conhecer o universo da franquia. Metro: Redux é a versão definitiva dos dois títulos da série e seu grande nível de qualidade deixa uma boa perspectiva do que podemos esperar para os trabalhos futuros do estúdio 4A Games.


Pros:

* Jogabilidade renovada ajuda a atualizar Metro 2033
* Nova engine contribui para tornar os títulos ainda mais bonitos
* Modos de jogo agradam tanto aos fãs do terror quanto a quem gosta de jogos de tiro mais tradicionais

The inability to create your own deck removes a key component to what makes CCGs so much fun and addictive. If nothing else, this game serves as a great introduction to the real card game. | Uno dei giochi storici nel mondo LUDICO. Un famosissimo gioco cartaceo portato online. Personalmente qui mi dividerò in due parti. Mi complimento con l'idea di portare Magic online e dare l'opportunità di giocare in piu persone e da piu parti del mondo (Voto personale all'idea 9.5).
La seconda parte invece è totalmente in disaccordo, poichè il gioco, nato cartaceo, è bello proprio perchè è un collezionabile a cui ci si doveva dedicare anche per plastificare le proprie carte per mantenerle intatte, la bellezza del collezionare e di toccare con mano il proprio mazzo, la bellezza del cercare giocatori disposti a spostarsi per giocare o la bellezza dell' organizzare serate a casa dedicate a Magic, come anche si organizzavano (e si organizzano tutt'ora) giocate a D&D (voto personale negativo 1)

Wait for a decent one.
For what I can see you can't really make your decks but just add cards to some existing deck. At best you can win new decks which is really worse than make a new one.
The only positive points are graphics and sounds. You can consider it an introduction to Magic, but a very limited one.
It is slow loading.

[h2]既令人惊叹，又令人哀叹[/h2]
游戏对世界细节和系统的刻画简直到了迷恋的地步，令人惊叹之处多不胜数，有很多即使到续作中也无法比拟。举个例子，游戏中的加油站可以真的加油，有专门的动画，加油的人还会跟你闲聊。路人开车拐弯时会打转向灯，在雪地上走路会打滑，见到你偷车会报警，对你不爽会打架，闻到你身上的臭味会作出反应。他们的各种生活化动作极为丰富，有些甚至连主角都比不上。警察会侦测你超速和撞车等不法行为，会对你罚款，碰到麻烦可以加以贿赂，通缉分为对车和对人的。如果商店被抢，警察会上门调查。店员被杀的话则会关店，标记为犯罪现场。枪械射击不同位置的反应不同，血迹有脚印效果。近战有很多招式，还有终结技。电台会报道最近的事件，很多曲目都是精心挑选的，名字和歌词都与正在发生的剧情有所关联。雪有专门的物理效果，会被打散，汽车开起来以后，车顶的雪会被吹散融化，环境破坏效果强……

然而，游戏虽提供了一个庞大的世界，但实际空洞无趣，严重缺乏可交互性。所有公共交通工具无法使用，无法买车买房，几乎没有养成要素，没有多少能花钱的地方。没有支线任务，没有可探索地点，几乎没有选择，没有成长，在剧情之外几乎没有可以干的事情。无法游泳，甚至无法进到水里。开车的时候无法跳车，甚至无法在车内射击，直接少了近一半的射击乐趣，主线驾驶过于冗长。整体有种半成品的感觉，关于这一切的原因放在后面单独说。

[h2]逐章分解【剧透】[/h2]
游戏开场的回忆实际发生于游戏最后一章的开头，当时的维托得罪了两大家族和三合会，心如乱麻，于是通过看相册整理思绪。回忆中一家人初踏帝国湾土地时，仔细看动画就能在里面找到好几个后来会碰到的人物，比如码头老大及其手下、医生和克莱门特家族老大。维托一家当时住的那个破房子也有实景，可以进入，可惜在后续中再没有涉及。

第一章的标题为The Old Country，其实就是系列新作《黑手党：故乡》的副标题，预告片中出现的城镇就是第一章战斗发生的地图。维托于1925年出生在那里，1932年离开去往美国。这一章给人的感觉就是豪横，偌大的小镇有一大片精致的建模，敌人、武器、游击队、卡车、吉普车、坦克、飞机等主要的美术内容全都一股脑在极短时间内呈现出来，各种破坏效果也是一个接着一个。虽然游戏呈现的效果非常出色，但这仍让人不禁联想如果这一段在西西里的战斗能够拉长为多个章节该多好。实际上，编剧正是这么策划的，后面谈到删减部分的时候会详细说到。

第二章制作的同样极为出色，最令我惊奇的就是回家那一段。如果肯四处走走，你会跟报摊老板、餐厅里的曾经的老相好丽莎、老奶奶、因战争关店的老先生聊聊天。见识到杂货店里的冲突，忙碌的理发店，不让老公跟朋友出去的妻子，B17轰炸机飞过头顶，吵架时把东西丢出窗外的泼妇，跳窗后着陆不当的猫咪等。细节实在太过丰富，让人赞叹！家庭所欠的两千块债务是个沉重且急迫的担子，驱动了维托的行为，政府一周给的二十块津贴可远远不够。这部分还有段帮女人修车的剧情，完成后会获得成就，不容错过。乔的公寓同样细节满满，很多地方都可以互动。偷炸弹帮的车的时候，打倒第一个人后可以进门拿一把霰弹枪，果然偷车才是最赚钱的，一下子就赚三四百。

第三章里会跟德里克和斯蒂芬对话，如果带着已知父亲遇害原因的眼光看，就能感觉出来他们对维托父亲之死知情，而且有担心维托是来寻仇的，在提防着他。维托刚刚赚过快钱，是不可能老老实实搬箱子赚十块钱的，很干脆地选择收保护费来赚一百。另外，码头工人工会、港口以及走私业务都是芬奇家族的业务之一，德里克是个头目。偷油票的任务设计的也很棒，有段极为有意思的保安对话，那位保安预言了以后电子游戏的到来，哈哈。大部分人第一次玩都会在打开保险箱的时候触发警报，其实可以潜行去地下室提前关闭警报，还会获得成就。这样的话跟亨利的对话会有所不同，拿到的钱也更多，算一算这两天就已经赚够一千了。

第四章里终于开始接触黑手党高层了，派任务是帝国湾新晋克莱门特家族的头目（二把手）卢卡·古里诺，他们主要以前期常去的弗莱迪酒吧为据点，此外还拥有一家屠宰场。卢卡把任务交给手下亨利，亨利负责找有能力的外人完成。从这一章可以感觉到删减，衣服直接由乔搞定，只是等到天黑就去执行任务了。似乎本应有搞到衣服的前置任务，或者在等待的时间里安排些别的事情。这也导致本章非常短促。这一章同时开始涉及爱尔兰人的奥尼尔帮，夜间偷珠宝的时候碰到他们老大布莱恩·奥尼尔并交火。最终维托和乔逃走，布莱恩被抓入狱。标题墨菲定律已经在暗示，可能会出问题的事情就一定会出问题。亨利接连给的两个任务都遇到麻烦，事后想想可能是有原因的。

第五章的时间跟之前差了一个多星期，不再像之前是连续的了，但从跟卢卡的对话看来似乎又没隔多久。从本章开始接触到帮派老大阿尔贝托·克莱门特，并且有机会正式入会。入会费高达五千，那可是相当大的一笔钱，当然以后会知道这是该帮派为人不齿的地方。刺杀酒厂老板任务中遭遇的敌人也是奥尼尔帮的，送受伤的亨利去找的医生曾出现在开场动画中。任务完成后获得两千，足够帮家里还清债务了。本章一开始跟女人的接触是维托为数不多的此类时刻之一，帮助她还可获成就。

第六章里维托被判刑入狱，出现第一人称视角，整体是在模仿《肖申克的救赎》。本来债务还清，家庭事业都在上升期。然而，一切迅速坠落，审判时见的母亲已是最后一面。自己攒下的钱，没用给母亲用在看病上，也没能给姐姐用在婚礼上，全花在了葬礼上。第四章得罪了奥尼尔帮，在监狱里自然少不了布莱恩的特殊关照，幸好在文奇家族军师莱奥的帮助下，维托磨练近战技巧，最终击败布莱恩。只是他不识好歹非得用刀，最后被维托反杀。

第七章开始环境大变，借着战后经济复苏与崛起，彻底告别了之前紧张萧瑟的战争氛围，转而变成了春暖花开的黄金时代。出狱后别着急去找乔，可以先回家看看，会遇到姐姐的丈夫埃里克。不仅如此，再去拜访以前的杂货店、枪店和码头，全都有对话。这几年里亨利消失不见，乔搭上了法尔科内家族，维托虽然早前搭上了文奇家族，但还是随了乔。这次一上来就接触到法尔科内家族的头目艾迪，约在风月场所。可能是碍于分级制，这一段本可以安排更露骨的内容，但维托没有任何行为。虽然多次跟乔的女人眉来眼去，但始终没有什么，也许本该有条完整的爱情线。开车的时候如果停车，埃迪会下车吐，不然的话会吐在车里。新闻里说牡蛎湾有香烟丢失，这其实是在为下一章铺垫。另外，被埋尸的弗兰基原本是个重要人物，是个真正的FBI卧底，有专门的配音演员，但是他的故事仅仅退化成了一个额外网站。

第八章卖的烟，正是上一章里新闻说丢失的那批。这次遭遇的是个街头帮派，叫油头帮，破坏他们据点那段充分展示了游戏的破坏效果，算得上是标志性场面。因为卡车被烧，欠下埃迪两千，在工厂剿灭整个帮派后靠卖车赚了回来，合着辛苦一通就赚了点烟钱和分成（结果制作组还把分成的钱忘了）。

第九章开始接触法尔科内家族老大，他们以马耳他猎鹰酒吧为据点。克莱门特家族眼红法尔科内的毒品生意，绑架了会计等人想要逼问出毒品来源以便自己接管，两大帮派的战争由此挑起。这一章需要完全潜行，最终克莱门特家族二把手卢卡被绞成肉馅。完事后带着一身秽物直接去找埃迪或者换好衣服之后找埃迪，会触发不同的动画。至此，过了三分之二的流程，维托终于正式入会。虽然入的不是文奇家族，但莱奥也促成了此事。入会仪式上大佬云集，法尔科内是主持，文奇则是老大，不知有没有克莱门特家族的人。文奇像《教父》一样重申不能碰毒品生意，但法尔科内家族早就开始做毒品生意了，与其余两个家族的战争正在暗中酝酿。末尾的买车、买房、买西装、以及打人和杀人的快速剪辑加快了叙事的效率，但或许本该是个额外章节。

后续章节的解析放不下了，放到指南里了，感兴趣的请移步去指南区。

[h2]剧作分析[/h2]
本作和前作在故事层面有很多的重合之处，主体都是一个普通人被迫或者半被迫卷入黑手党组织，逐渐升至高位，但终究还是走向失控，最后招来祸患的故事。两位主角一个曾是出租车司机，一个曾是小混混/军人（解释了主角为何战斗力强悍），让人有很强的代入感，后来都进入黑手党并参与帮派战争。他们都做出过刺杀等不少伤天害理的事情，但内心仍保留着一部分的善，仍愿意承担风险救人（一个弗兰克，一个莱奥）。他们身边都有两个最好的朋友，最后却都面临着背叛抉择和生离死别。一番摸爬滚打，吃了不少苦头，可到头来还是一无所有。二代临近结局的时候，居然和初代的结局发生了奇妙的融合：第十四章里维托和乔去刺杀的污点证人正是前作里的主角汤米；前作结局里汤米被萨列里派一胖一瘦两名杀手刺杀，没想到正是二代的两位主角。初代重制版里过场动画做出更改，直接将两位杀手替换成了二代主角们的形象，成为又一款新作主角杀死前作主角的游戏。

不同之处显然也很多，前作汤米进入黑手党主要还是身不由己，本作的维托更多的是有意为之，他是真的向往有钱的日子。失落天堂市的帮派战争集中在萨列里和莫雷洛两大家族，汤米自始至终没有更换帮派。帝国湾涉及三大家族和一些其他大大小小的帮派，主角先后加入其中两个，还和第三个有着重要联系。前作的一大背景是美国的大萧条与禁酒令，后期主要坏事的是抢劫，也涉及毒品生意，但不是自己做的。本作的一大背景是美国梦与二战，后期坏事的则是毒品交易以及挑起帮派大战。前作在帮派战争和兄弟情之外，很重要的一部分就是汤米自己的爱情，对其原本家庭完全没有涉及。本作里的维托则自始至终基本没碰过女人（除了帮乔招来的女郎出头），也没有爱情产生，转而深入展示其原生家庭。

家庭在开场用于渲染成长背景，归乡后一方面展示亲情温暖，另一方面又渲染家庭经济上的脆弱。这为维托放弃一天十美元的苦工，转而作奸犯科赚大钱提供驱动力。直到后期，原生家庭仍然是主角所作所为的强烈动机。维托出人头地后，与姐姐无可避免的疏远，明明有了力量，却又无法施展带来深深无力感。父亲去世的原因揭晓后，主角幡然醒悟，带领码头工人反抗，不顾后果地完成复仇。维托的人生夹杂着更多的大起大落，稍有起色就被抓，一判就是十年。出狱后，好不容易正式入会过上了梦想中的日子，但转眼就被烧得一无所有，又得重新开始。后期似乎又有了翻盘的机会，但失去的却更多。

主角维托帅气逼人，似初是照着年轻时的马龙·白兰度捏的脸，但整个故事对维托刻画的并不深。他太过于受到外部环境的主宰，除了主动救莱奥和入会自白那段，很少显露自身性格，没有内在的魅力。简单说来就是太过工具人。配角乔和亨利的刻画倒还更胜一筹，至今大家仍在讨论亨利到底是不是叛徒，以及乔究竟死没死。乔在形象上逊于维托不少，但他花天酒地，敢爱敢恨，时而自信满满，志在必得；时而为了兄弟两肋插刀，义气满满；时而为了在乎的人懊悔不已，情绪失控；时而愤怒冲天，化身战神……角色不需完美，让玩家共情就能让人在乎。亨利的死亡太过突然和惨烈，让玩家措手不及，受到了强烈的情感冲击。其身边还环绕着一团迷雾，支持和不支持他是叛徒的证据同时存在，又没有哪一个足够直接，能给出定论。

说他是FBI的人会说中国帮和莱奥做了明确说明，仔细回想，几乎每一个涉及到亨利的事都没有好结果，比如因偷汽油票入狱；他的口音有问题，阶层不高但知道的太多；突然出现令人生疑，看着就像是被抓后跟警方做交易了；毒品生意主要是他的点子，并且一下子认出了假警察……另一方认为维托入狱一事另有告密者，DLC乔的冒险专门讲了。离职的编剧丹尼尔·瓦夫拉（Daniel Vávra）说亨利并不是叛徒，一切都是被法尔科内陷害的，他并没有理由那么做。有一章的电台中播放了一首关于一个名为亨利的人被陷害的歌。第七章里被埋的那个人是真正的卧底，但游戏发售前就介绍他的网站中直接提到亨利是黑手党，显然他并不是叛徒……双方都有证据，又都不那么直接。我个人还是更偏向于亨利是FBI的人这一说法，因为其证据主要在游戏内，反方证据主要在游戏之外。游戏大量的删减也是造成这一问题的重要原因。

[h2]令人遗憾的删减[/h2]
绝大多数游戏都会有删减：起初的规划总是宏伟的，但真做起来就会体会到实现的难度。然而，有些游戏的删减话题热度异常得高，时至今日仍不断被人提起，最具代表性的就是《黑手党2》、《生化奇兵3》和《辐射4》。为何会这么高呢？主要是其中的删减太过明显，到了玩家无法忽视的地步。《黑手党2》连预告中出现的内容都能被移除，封面上的第四个人是谁都不知道，曾经的许诺也没有实现。发售版本中到处是删减的痕迹，玩家一查就能发现。我汇总各方预告、消息、解包拿到的证据，分类说一下主要的几个方面。

一、城市公共交通系统，包括火车、地铁、巴士和出租车。我们在游戏中可见运行中的火车，但是永远无法登上，通往那里的门被堵住了。地铁站虽在DLC中展示了，但仍旧无法搭乘。巴士原本可以乘坐，出租车也是可以招呼的。结果，几乎整个公共交通系统被全部删除，第二章从酒吧回家需要搭乘出租车，但镜头一闪而过，你已经到目的地了，第七章也仅仅停留在过场动画里。这些删减使得玩家的出行仅剩开车一个方式，也难怪玩家抱怨开车太多。

二、汽车驾驶相关。车内视角，不是只看到引擎盖的那个，而是能看到仪表盘和方向盘的真正车内视角。后备箱原本可自由使用，用于存放物品和武器，但删到仅出现在过场中，要知道路人都是可以使用的。有些车辆也被删除，比如摩托车、军车（不是DLC里的那辆）和叉车。带有对话的查理的汽修店也被删除。自由驾驶模式被删除，这也使得本作成为系列里唯一没有自由驾驶模式的。

三、警察相关。原本可以购买枪支许可证，被警察见到当众持枪后可以出示，之后他就不管了。枪支许可证还对应有个教学事件，逼退小混混后，被警察发现。闯红灯原本会触发警察的警报，实际只有同伴的吐槽，不过删了更方便。

四、世界互动。车展中心和房产中心被删除，仅在过场中一闪而过，车展中心变成了外部的汽车百科。实际上可以在店中购买汽车，也可以购买多套价格不同的房产。从破旧公寓到豪华别墅再到摩天大楼一应俱全，开场动画中家人来到帝国湾后最先住的那个破房子也在地图中。在住所中可以洗澡等，还能买报纸，钓鱼等。更多商店，如唱片店、披萨店、理发店、赛犬玩法也被删除。声望系统也没了，其数值会影响周围人对你的态度，还会影响购物价格和罚款数目。

五、故事类。原本故事中有多处关键选择节点，比如14章中放高利贷的布鲁诺坦言自己曾借贷给维托的父亲，也是导致其被杀的原因之一。原本可以是杀死布鲁诺的，这一类的选择在终章迎来不同走向，引向四种不同的结局，这一点被高级制作人Denby Grace所证实。实际时间线比游戏结束的那个时间点还要靠后，甚至还会讲1957年的事情。还有传言说意大利西西里岛的战役不止开场时候的那一段任务，而是一个完整的战役。此外，史蒂夫让维托烧毁汽车的任务挪到DLC，一名用于联络的角色被删除，还有一些动画被删除，对应着哪些章节和任务，我们就不得而知了。

除此之外，还有通关后本应该增加一种极限难度，大量室内场景的半成品。十几种武器被删除，包括大量近战武器，包括棒球棍、小刀、指虎、警棍、扳手等，还有木柄手榴弹、火箭筒等……

[h2]为何如此？[/h2]
这些内容可不是仅仅停留在开发组的大脑或者纸面上，而是基本都已经做完了。有些玩家稍作修改就能调出莱，再给制作组一点时间，相信他们肯定能将其放入到游戏之中。那么，到底是为什么呢？直接原因就是Bug来不及调试，而且为了赶发售时间，需要先把主线做完，已经没有时间花在上面那些内容上了，干脆删掉或隐藏。

不论如何，《黑手党2》的开发过程中必定发生了重大的问题，我将其归纳为外部原因和内部原因。外部原因主要来自于世代更替和引擎变动。制作组本来打算采用系列初代的LS3D引擎，瞄准XBOX和PS2平台。那时正好碰上新旧世代主机交替，XBOX 360和PS3接连发布。为了适应新主机，他们改用曾被用于制作GTA3和马克思佩恩2的Renderware引擎，大量工作重新来了一遍。然而，该引擎又被EA买断，制作组的使用权被取消。最终制作组被迫在LS3D引擎的基础上重新制作Illusion引擎，这来回的折腾浪费了不少时间和资源。

内部原因则来自高层干预。系列初代成功后，引得Take-Two在2008年对Illusion Softworks进行收购，此后改名为2K Czech。小公司原本的体系架构必须适应大型母公司的要求，高层的集体决策取代原本的制作人说了算，独立性被大大压缩。设计师兼首席编剧丹尼尔·瓦夫拉（Daniel Vávra）曾负责编写《黑手党2》的剧本，他所设计的很多任务和结局都被删减了。他本人在游戏发售1年前离职，原工作室的几位员工也在不久后离职。总之，游戏开发遭到了高层的巨大干预，而且给予资金和时间也不足。

曾有传言说《黑手党2》原本应该有130-150章，但我并不相信。要是他们真的做出100多章，那么《黑手党2》要么成为史上最伟大的游戏，要么就成为史上最拖沓的游戏，而我偏向于后者。个人认为章节翻倍，即二十多章（有人说22章）原本是他们的计划，也就是说游戏砍掉了近一半的章节。在时间和资金都不足的情况下，迫于高层的压力，制作组挑出了游戏最精华的章节以及完成度最高的一个官方结局组成了主线。能拼出这个动人故事就很不容易了，这也间接说明了本作原本的潜力有多高，如果按照开发组的设想，完成原本计划的开放世界玩法，或许能成为GTA级别的超级大作也不一定。

[h2]惊喜的收集品，糟糕的DLC[/h2]
本作中有《花花公子》和通缉令两种收集品，我对159张通缉令的兴趣不大，但杂志模特页收集实在让人无法自拔。哪怕到现在我仍然保留着主线中收集的50张和DLC中的19张原版高清图片。不得不说，大胸实在太好看了。其中直接露骨的成人内容令当时的我血脉贲张，身材惹火的女郎可比很多同期游戏中遮遮掩掩的演出要好看得多。

《吉米的背叛》和《吉米的复仇》两个DLC烂到我不想再提，仅有开场和结局配有一段动画，中间则是令人恼火的任务。仅仅配一张图片就丢给你一个任务，到处是破坏沉浸感的网游式设计，无聊透顶。偏偏有些任务还特别难，让我尝试了十几次。乔的冒险是所有DLC最好的一个，有四个剧情任务，但这个好只是相对的。该DLC原本是夹在维托入狱那段时间的，开场与维托被捕衔接。乔作为第二个可控角色去探寻好友入狱的原因，其中的潜行和冰上追逐那段十分精彩。此外还应该多讲讲和马蒂的故事，才能更好解释乔伤心欲绝的原因。然而，急转直下，不再有任何动画，又变成无聊透顶的图片任务。纯纯浪费了里面制作得那么好的新场景，整体看来把本作的DLC评为史上最差DLC也并不为过！ | Отличная игра с шикарной атмосферой и сюжетом. Приятная даже для 2025 года графика. Из минусов это в первую очередь мертвый город без активностей и унылые DLC. А так твердые 8/10, нестареющая классика. | [h1]以美國黑手黨為主題的簡化版 GTA[/h1]

[b]因為遊戲太老，只能存取到 2GB 的系統記憶體，導致現在新電腦玩的時候有機會運行一段時間就閃退。解決方法是去 Google 搜尋並下載一個叫「4GB Patch」的小程式，只要用這個程式運行一次遊戲的執行檔（mafia2 exe）就可以修復問題。（執行檔位置在 Steam\steamapps\common\Mafia II\pc 內）[/b]

主角 Vito Scaletta 在七歲的時候就跟隨著家人從義大利西西里移民到美國帝國灣追尋「美國夢」，但惡劣的居住環境和拮据的生活在 Vito 眼裡卻只是一場惡夢。在環境所迫之下，長大後的 Vito 決定與死黨 — Joe 過上犯罪生活，不過 Vito 卻在其中一次偷竊期間失手被捕，最終還得以參軍代替牢役。

回國後的 Vito 與 Joe 開始在黑手黨 Clementi 家族底下幹活，及後他更在獄中認識了自己的「犯罪教父」 Leo。Leo 十分欣賞 Vito 的能力與膽識，他甚至推薦 Vito 成為 Falcone 家族的正式成員，而正當 Vito 平步青雲的時候，他也逐漸地捲進 Clementi、Falcone 與 Vinci 三大黑手黨家族的暗鬥之中，最後 Vito 更成為了整起風暴的中心並且付出了他最不願意看到的代價……

[h3]🔸 [b]經典版還是決定版？[/b][/h3]
從畫質角度來說，決定版修改了一些貼圖和光線品質，但體感分別最大的還是顏色飽和度的增加，不過這比較看個人喜好，筆者就傾向經典版的色調，Youtube 上有很多比較影片，想知道詳細分別的話可以去看看。至於 Bug 方面，其他玩家反映決定版還是一樣有各種問題，但文首提到的 2GB 閃退 Bug 應該是修好了。另外決定版是有中文語言的，所以筆者覺得，如果你是英文苦手，那就玩決定版；如果英文應付得來，就玩經典版吧。
[hr][/hr]
[h3]👍 [b]遊戲優點[/b][/h3]
[list]
[*]豐富的配角群設計。相比起主角，配角群的人設其實來得更加突出。從四肢發達頭腦簡單的死黨 Joe，到軍師 Leo、高利貸 Bruno、黑醫 El Greco，甚至小弟 Marty 等都令人更感興趣。

[*]詳細的車輛與相關系統。Mafia 系列一直都相對花心思在車輛相關的系統上，二代本體＋DLC 總共有 46 種車輛，除了大型車輛之外，其他的駕駛手感都不錯，玩家把車開到維修站還可以升級引擎、改車牌或改塗裝等，另外還有一些細節設計，例如按喇叭時前方車輛會靠邊迴避、加油站真的可以加油等（但沒甚麼卵用就是了）。

[*]PLAYBOY 雜誌收集。遊戲的其中一項可收集內容就是 PLAYBOY，而它們都是以前 50 和 60 年代真實的 PLAYBOY 封面，就算在 GTA 裡也沒做到這種尺度，不過之後四代的背景會回到義大利，這種內容高機率不會再有了。

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3413706711
[h3]👎 [b]遊戲缺點[/b][/h3]
[list]
[*]花瓶般的開放式世界。之前玩一代決定版的時候就發現過同樣問題了，這遊戲（系列）的開放式世界基本上就只是單純的佈景板，頂多也就是為了交通功能而服務，完全稱不上是一個有「生命力」的世界。筆者覺得最可惜的地方是沒有世界相關的支線任務，所以除非是想收集那些無聊的通緝海報，否則根本就沒有任何誘因去探索地圖的其他位置。

[*]強制性主線任務。上面提到遊戲並沒有支線任務，而主線任務更是無縫扣在玩家身上的，這讓玩家無時無刻都是在前往任務的過程當中，就像被主線推著走一樣，可能製作組也知道世界裡沒甚麼東西好自由探索的，所以趕緊迫玩家解主線好了。

[*]故事缺乏追看性。老實說二代的故事雖然不算差，但卻沒有想要追看的那個衝動，原因可能是因為故事以「案件式」的章節來進行，很多故事情節都是突然展開，整個劇情鋪排並沒有到很仔細，而這也相對難帶動玩家的情緒。

[*]兒戲的通緝系統。這遊戲有像 GTA 般的通緝系統，但強度完全不能比，因為無論幾星也好，都只會出現一般的警察，而且數量只有零星幾位，玩家只要把視線內的警察解決掉，通緝很快就會解除，整個系統就是非常的雞肋。

[*]各種 Bug。除了一開始說明的閃退問題之外，還有各種奇怪 Bug，例如第四章被通緝時會進入長時間的藍畫面慢動作，要跑一段長距離才能回復，還有在第十章過場動畫中的 Joe 模型會消失等。

二代雖然作為系列中評價最好的一作，但無論是世界體驗、故事深度或系統設計上都經不起時間的考驗，而整體的遊玩體驗也只算是一個全方位簡化的 GTA。希望即將推出的新作《四海兄弟：故鄉》除了畫質提升之餘，也能夠創造出一些 IP 獨有的新優勢，而不用再活在 GTA 的影子之下。

[/quote] | I usually don’t bother chasing achievements in games I don’t enjoy. But Mafia II?
I’ve loved this game ever since I was a kid. And even now, after all these years, it’s still my favourite in the entire franchise.

But here’s the thing—
Even with all that love, Mafia II isn’t perfect. And that’s exactly why I’m writing this review.
Let me tell you why this game has stuck with me for so long… and where it almost lost me.

Mafia II is one of the most fascinating games I’ve ever played. It’s a [b]very linear game masquerading as an open-world sandbox[/b]—kind of like L.A. Noire, but without the investigative depth.

[b]The driving.[/b] Oh boy.
90% of Mafia II is just you driving from Point A to Point B. Watch a cutscene, drive again. Blow up a hotel? Sure. But then, more driving. You are Vito Scaletta—
What? No, I’m not.
[b]Yes, you are. Shut up.[/b]

You’re an upstanding gentleman in the waste management consulting business. Your motivation? [b]Money.[/b] Vito comes back from WWII to find out his dear ol’ dad blew all the family money on booze, took out loans, and then rudely died, leaving the debt to Vito’s family. With his back against the wall, Vito has only one option left: working a 9-to-5.

[b]But wait![/b]
Lucky for Vito, he’s got his buddy Joe Barbaro—a man so resourceful, he might as well be the richest guy in Empire Bay. Joe hooks Vito up with a place to live, some cash, a car, a gun, and job connections. Honestly, at this point, I wondered why Joe didn’t just pay the debts himself. But hey, [b]this is where the fun begins.[/b]
And by fun, I mean… more driving.

[h2] Money, Money, Money… and More Driving [/h2]
Money-making in Mafia II is limited. Besides paying off your family’s debt, you can splurge on guns, suits, and upgrading your car. But earning money? Mostly through story missions. You can ""borrow"" from shopkeepers or do odd jobs at the scrapyard, but nothing beats just progressing the story.

Here’s where it gets weird:
You can earn more than enough money to pay off the family debt early in the game. But you can’t pay it off until the story lets you because… plot reasons. Vito needs to get arrested, go to prison, and learn who’s boss in the iron hotel.

Play for five minutes, and you’ll feel it: [b]2K Czech had big plans for Mafia II[/b], but a lot was cut. There’s leftover dialogue, hinted mechanics, and implied features that never made it in. The game doesn’t feel incomplete, but you can’t help but wonder what could’ve been.

And then you discover the [b]DLCs[/b]—
Joe’s Adventures , The Betrayal of Jimmy and Jimmy's vendetta
My advice? [b]Don’t.[/b]
They’re atrocious. Imagine GTA III mission design, but with timers slapped on everything. Tailing missions with a timer? Who thought that was a good idea?

[h2] Driving: The Real Main Character [/h2]
Let’s talk about the driving mechanics since that’s 90% of your playtime. Without driving, Mafia II would be a 30-minute game. But you know what? [b]The driving is great.[/b]

If you liked GTA IV’s driving, you’ll feel right at home. The 1940s-50s cars feel weighty, clunky, and require actual skill to handle. The attention to detail in the vehicles is incredible, and the ability to shoot gas tanks and make cars explode adds a tactical layer to combat.

But it’s not just the cars. [b]The city feels alive.[/b]
The police will pull you over for speeding or running red lights. There’s even a button to cap your speed limit so you can avoid fines. It’s funny—this game about crime has you constantly obeying traffic laws. But it works. It makes Empire Bay feel like a real, living city.

[h2] Combat: From Fists to Firefights [/h2]
The [b]melee combat?[/b]
Imagine L.A. Noire’s boxing mixed with Yakuza’s heat moves. Early on, fights feel like two old guys arguing at a pub. But once Vito learns counter-attacks in prison (midway through the game), combat becomes smoother and more satisfying.

[b]Gunfights[/b] are rare but impactful. When they happen, they’re intense and well-designed. The weapon selection is limited, but honestly, it’s all you need. Pistols, shotguns, Tommy guns, and rifles—simple but effective. However, half the guns feel redundant, and ammo is sometimes annoyingly scarce.

[h2] The Story: The Game’s True Heart [/h2]
While the gameplay has its ups and downs, [b]the story is where Mafia II shines.[/b]
The characters are memorable, the cutscenes are well-directed, and the atmosphere of post-war America is beautifully captured. Vito’s journey from a struggling veteran to a made man is compelling, even if the linear structure feels restrictive at times.

[h1] My Final Thoughts [/h1]
Mafia II is a game I had a loved since I was a kid. At first, I kinda disliked the linearity and repetitive driving. But as I got older and replayed it with a more patient mindset every year near christmas , I realized how unique and special it is.

It’s not perfect.
It’s not as open-ended as it pretends to be.
But it’s [b]an unforgettable experience[/b]—one that stands out in the crowded world of open-world crime games.

If you haven’t played it yet, give it a shot. And if you played it before and didn’t like it, maybe give it another chance.

My favourite Mafia Game

Too bad on my new pc it just bugs when the police wants to arrest you so sadly no replay :("
76561197970569635,1030830,Mafia II: Definitive Edition,0.0,"Action, Adventure",0,"The best mafia game in the series. Brilliant story, amazing setting, one of my favourites ive played through a million times (my first start-up of the remaster recently and I love it! It does look & sound better - so it modernises it a little). The crash bug did happen to me, as with everyone else and was so annoying but can be stopped easily..

You can get around the annoying crashes on start-up by blocking all outgoing traffic for the game in windows firewall:
In Windows Defender Firewall, delete all ""Mafia II: Definitive edition"" inbound rules, and right-click outbound rules > New rule > create an outbound rule > Program > Select Mafia's exe file located in the install folder > Action - ""Block the connection"". You can still unlock achievements, it will just lock out 2k's rubbish and prevent login - which is no bad thing anyway as all it is doing is sending you adverts on the main menu... lol | Испортили офигенную игру. Просто говнище, симулятор багов. Решил поиграть в этот шедевр, но сначала пришлось бороться с вылетами в главном меню, исправил. После чего пришлось менять язык, поменял. Уже прошел две главы, захожу в игру на следующий день и оказывается просто напросто ничего не сохранилось! Замечательно вообще блять! Пришлось искать решение проблемы, опять же, САМОМУ, но тут мне уже ничего не помогло. И самое смешное, что в интернете просто тысячи отзывов по поводу этих проблем. Но этим даунам из 2K просто похуй, они за 4 года не смогли исправить эти проблемы. За то экранчик добавили в главном меню блять!! Ставлю 10 вылетов из 10 | Після прекрасної першої частини серії, пограти в Mafia II було наче вступити в гівно. В старі часи ця гра мені взагалі не сподобалась, але тут я вирішив пройти всю трилогію, і може дати їй ще один шанс, адже мене здивувала велика кількість фанів. Результат лише підтвердив початкові враження: це відстій. Я рідко пишу негативні рецензії, але це саме той випадок. 

[h2]Ремастер: технічний жах. [/h2]

Це кривий, забагований плювок у вічі від розробників. Гра вилітає в меню, мова не змінюється, певні глави доводиться перепроходити через безкінечні завантаження. Аудіовізуальні баги, такі як проблеми з волоссям, збої озвучування чи потрапляння у текстури, вже навіть не дивують. 2К забили болт на всі ці проблеми, бо судячи з форумів, це глобальні речі, що відбуваються уже дуже давно у більшості гравців. Щодо графіки — вона майже не відрізняється від оригіналу.

[h2]Геймплей: рутина й одноманітність. [/h2]

Основна частина ігрового процесу — це їзда на машині, що займає 70%+ ігрового часу. В цей час поки їздимо туди-назад через всю мапу, любуємось нудним відкритим світом та слухаємо жарти про те, що водимо тачку як бабця Джо. Весь інший час слухаємо жарти про те, що стріляємо, як сестра Джо. Іноді дають пограти в стелс, весь інший час стріляємо з-за хованок. Ніякої динаміки геймплею немає - що було на початку, те буде і в кінці, тому жодна місія не здається унікальною. 

[h2]Сюжет: з’явився і зник [/h2]

Вибачте, будуть спойлери. Історія розповідає про типовий шлях бандита, який постійно потрапляє в проблеми через компанію, і завжди розгрібає наслідки чужих дій. За 13 годин я вбив 685 ворогів - абсурд.  Спочатку сюжет здається навіть логічним, і є надія на світле майбутнє у гри, але далі картковий будиночок обвалюється.
Преамбула кінцівки з наркотиками та федеральним кротом - висосана з пальця, конфлікт із тріадами взагалі виглядає штучно вставленим задля якоїсь драми, однак самої ж драми не стається. Чому я почав з кінцівки? Бо основна лінія це просто біготня головного героя під дудку всіх трьох сімей Емпайр-Бей, в тій чи іншій мірі, без жодних моральних дилем, та при повній однобокості. Типові базові завдання - убиваєш шісток, убиваєш головну ціль - поїхали додому спати.
Сама ж кінцівка незграбна та розмита, доля героїв залишається вам на догадки (і на третю частину, як я розумію). Багато фонових подій та персонажів теж залишаються без уваги, наприклад, сестри Віто, і навіть відсилка до ""Хрещеного батька"" не рятує ситуацію. Історія повернення Лео Галанте (що відсилає нас до Френка з першої частини) - а на біса нам це знати :) Просто отримайте героя знову. 
Час від часу виникають питання в доцільності деяких ігрових механік, як допустим грошей, додаткових способів заробітку, чи заправок авто. Самий знаковий випадок в мене: Віто втрачає житло, Джо пропонує йому халупу, по дорозі до цього житла я заробляю декілька тисяч доларів і тут же герой жаліється на відсутність грошей для готелю. Я розумію що це скрипт, однак комічність ситуації від цього нікуди не зникає. 
Найбільша проблема — це сам Віто. Він залишається порожнім героєм від самого початку до самого кінця. У нього немає власної думки, внутрішніх конфліктів чи чогось, що робило б його цікавим. Він — просто виконавець завдань, маріонетка в руках мафіозного світу. 

[h2]Позитивні моменти[/h2]

Похвалити можу лише за цікаві колекційні предмети (хехе). Складність на рівні Hard адекватна, фізика авто на реалістичному режимі дуже приємна. 

[h2]Висновок[/h2]

Mafia II могла бути гідним продовженням першої частини, але на ділі все вийшло зовсім гірше. Можна проводити багато паралелей сюжету, і скрізь він буде слабшим. Технічні проблеми, поверхнева історія, нудний геймплей і відсутність належного розвитку персонажів роблять цю гру важкою для проходження, чисто главу в день проходив і вимикав. Усі її позитивні моменти губляться в морі нецікавості.

Рекомендувати не можу, але якщо ви фанат, що готовий закрити очі на всі проблеми, то залишайтесь таким. Іншим з дещицею здорового глузду і критичним мисленням - краще уникати. | （5h）在这冰面上开车真不习惯，性能极差，而且车辆不像一代最终版有档位可以调节，操作手感和体验不如第一代最终版。

（16h）出狱以后路况和车辆性能好很多了，不过有两个恶性BUG无论如何得说一下，第一个就是地图同时出现了两个粉红目的地，一个是主线任务标，一个是卡了BUG的餐馆标，然后还有第14章对话语音重叠的问题，这个无大碍，但是另一个就很糟心了，当我送完乔去医生那，准备去还钱，到达目的地以后，门竟然触发不了，这是什么意思，我还得重新第14章再来一遍吗？

（18h）关于第14章，准备还钱结果卡在破巷子打不开门的解决方法，首先忍痛重新载入第14章，是的，重新开始第14章，然后解决完一系列事情，把码头老板干掉拿完那两万块以后，直接去北边大叔的废车碾压机卖车赚钱，一定记住，路上千万不要抢劫商店，不然你又会陷入卡在那个破巷子无法开门的困境之中。

（20h）一直到最后，我都还以为维托会开门跳车，然后右上角出现一个30秒的倒计时把乔给救下，唉，看来我还是想多了。 | Game crashes on startup when I close the 2k account login window on the main menu.

Since the game is already out for a while now, it is pretty cheap as well, but trust me, it is worth every penny. | This game is amazing, don't let its release date fool you into thinking you should buy something newer.

Pros:
- Affordable
- There is a skirmish mode
- Multiplayer is still very active and a lot of fun
- The campaign is mind blowing, you learn how to adapt when against overwhelming odds
- Several factions with a lot of units to choose from, making battles very interesting

Cons:
- None, I can't think of anything.

Seriously unlike ""Wargame"", R.U.S.E might look confusing at first, but you'll master it in no time, while actually having a fun. | If you are a fan of RTS (real time strategy) games  the R.U.S.E. is a must have.

R.U.S.E. is a simplified version of the famous Wargame Series.

[b]Pros[/b]

-No limit cap

-8 players max

-All nations (excluding DLC nation) are equally powerful in personal proffesion (Italy is great for spamming and rushhing, United States is equally balanced all around, Germany contains extremely powerful units but they are very pricey ect)
In other words all nations balance each other out.

-Free Nuclear War DlC (gives nuclear gamemode that contains nuclear units)

-High replayable action

-Same creators of the Wargame series

[b]Cons[/b]

-Not as many units like Wargame, but does contain decent amount of units, its not like 3 units per bulding

{Updated Added Con}
-Multiplayer lacks many online players. Rank matches are dead. Public player matches contain mostly players who been playing the game for hours (in other words too many elite players, rookies don't stand a chance.) 

-Japanese Nation available for $9.99 is out of balance and contains a very over powered units that can and does leave fellow players without much of a fair fight. 

-DLCs are over priced...

-No R.U.S.E. 2... not much of a GAME con but still why :(

-Level Cap 100

Intense campaign, Seat grasping battles,  well speculated gameplay, and easy to manage micro units 
this game gets a 

10/10 when Japan is either on my team or not in the match at all

and a 

9/10 when Japan is against me. | R.U.S.E. is a strategy game that is based off of world war 2. There are a HUGE amount of things that are just awesome about this game.

Imagine that you are a general, leading the American army, and you find out you are up against the germans. You build your base and eventually start building some units. You use some RUSES (which are kinda like special tactics, only every faction has these) and find the enemy base. Then suddenly, a group of panzer IV's goes on a rampage in your base, but you survive. You start building anti-tank units and recon units to see where they are coming from. You see that they are using tanks along with air support. You see that there is a flaw with this, as they don't have any long range support, so you build some artillery (suprisingly, they work kinda like wargame. Long range, but only effective against large groups of units and buildings.) You start sending volley after volley against the enemy base, so he is forced to counter this. Meanwhile, you start building your own tanks and infantry, and while he is busy tracking down your artillery and trying to counter it, you attack. His Panzars, weakened by the barrage, fall easily to your Sherman medium tanks and you destroy his base, winning the match.

The units are actually accurate to history, meaning they have their own strengths and weaknesses that are reasonable. For ex: tanks are excellent against infantry and other tanks, but are no match to fighter-bombers. Another example are the bombers. They are slow and can't defend themselves from fighters, so you have to escort them with fighters.

I haven't really tried the multiplayer out yet, but it seems pretty good.

The graphics are awesome in this game. You can see the explosions up close, with all of the dirt and debris flying all over the place. The units are also detailed, you can see the damage as units like tanks and other vehicles look more and more beaten up as they get shot at. The is awesome to look at, especially up close. The camera actually shakes from the impact of tank shells and heavy artillery and the explosions are just beautiful to look at, even at low graphics.

The damage is also effective. Certain units have more firepower than others, making them really effective at what they do, especially the units that you can get later in the game. Like the Germans King Tiger and the Americans Pershing heavy tank. One of these things could hold off against at least 4 medium tanks before they succumb.

There are also experimental units that are in this. The super pershing for the Americans is one of the most powerful tank in the American arsenal, but you need to get a experimental factory in order to make one. Experimental units can range from super-heavy artillery to anti-air guns that can wipe the sky clean of even the biggest squadrons of bombers single handedly. 

Overall, this game has a very good impression. You can have firefights that can last from 5 seconds to 20 minutes if you aren't careful. The graphics are amazing to look at. The overall strategy required for this game is tremendous, as every unit has a purpous and even one unit can ruin your chances of winning the game. 

I rate this game a 9.5/10.

P.S. There are a few things that make this different from Wargame. Like the fact that you don't have a limit to how many units you have or can have. | Steps on how to R.U.S.E.
1.) Get some friends to play with you
2.) Beat the bots on hard
3.) Think you're the best at this game
4.) Join an online match
5.) Build some supply depots
6.) Sit there helplessly while they are blown up
7.) Realize the only people who play this game are already Gods at it
8.) Continue playing against bots for the rest of your life, and never exit the safety of a private match.

exploring the map is quite fun and returning to an area is simple so its best to simply enter all the holes you can find

and the music here is also amazing, making the journey a banger all the way through
its quite cheap and well worth the price for the playtime you get, and somehow it still gets occasional updates | well i dont recommend it
the control is too slippery so it actually made the game really hard
as a precision platformer it should focus more level design using clever traps to increase the difficulty rather than through antihuman controls | It's like a modern atari, and i mean that in a good way. It's very simple to learn and I had a blast playing it, plenty of side content too post main game. Would recommend picking it up! | シンプルで洗練されたステージ。ちょいむずだけど、セーブがどこにでもあるのでサクサク進める爽快感があった。

The campaign is still a awesome masterpiece to play through just like the World at War campaign. Multiplayer in this game was peak but unfortunately playing on official servers these days is NOT safe due to RCE exploits you'll need to play on plutonium for a safe and secure experience. The zombies is still great the nostalgia goes hard, I recommend checking out the Renaissance mod and BO1 zombies reimagined. They don't make em like they used too.
Also Craptivision lower the prices on these games pls no wonder I pirated majority of the titles after the H2M cease and desist :) L activision buy this over BO6 btw | Possibly the best CoD Campaign in the whole series, classic weapons, and none of the over-the-top crap that ruins the more modern games | Amazing and intriguing story.

Zombies classic 6/10
Multiplayer 6/10 mainly because of the bootcamp with bots and leveling system

Campaign was fun in typical black ops fashion where it is trying to mess with your mind, even if you can see the plot twists coming from a mile away.

Zombies while fun is kinda obsolete these day, all the maps are remade including the DLC in Black ops 3, most are in the 5th DLC and the 2 missing maps (Five and Call of the dead) are remade by fans in the steam workshop.

Multiplayer is a very mixed bag, I like the bootcamp where you can play against bots and earn xp, it does cap you at prestige 1 and it is separated from the MP xp level system, but the way you unlock stuff is meh at best, you pretty much buy everything with earned in game credits.
And in my opinion which counts for both MP and Zombies is that everything feels kinda weak.

Sadly its cod on steam so it might not be safe to play thanks to hackers

The game is sadly quite dangerous to play if you use the vanilla steam version.
If you think about getting it then I highly recommend using plutonium or fully disconnecting from the internet and playing solo for the campaign/zombies/mp bots.

Personally I use Plutonium with bot warfare mods offline so I can still experience the game like it was on launch with earning XP, camos and calling cards. I know it's not the same as playing PVP but it's in my opinion not worth risking a RCE attack online | so heres my list
Graphics: okay
Gun play: weird but got used to 
maps: Great it has Nuketown
guns: well good

so over all 7.2 out of 10 | Lo recomiendo por la nostalgia, fuera de eso terrible depende la persona y como lo veas, si fuera como el multi de PS3 seria mil veces mejor, es horrible la progresion hoy dia ya que no juega mucha gente y los que quedan son hackers

However as of 02/02/25 I cannot recommend this game to anyone with Windows 11 and/or newer hardware like Intel i9 CPU's (10+ cores is a MAJOR ISSUE) or Nvidia 40 series GPU's, as it absolutely refuses to run longer than 20 minutes without either soft or hardlocking your PC, and that's even if you can get it to boot in the first place. I have spent many hours trying numerous combinations of fixes for things such as framerate, controls, graphical errors, DLC removal, Inaccessible bonus rooms and so... SO MUCH more, to absolutely no avail.
Please do not waste your time with this version of the game until EA pull their thumb out of their bunghole and fix their game.

EDIT: 12 hours after I wrote this review, I managed to stabilise DS2 enough to play it for an hour without any crashes. 
If you do attempt to get this game working on a PC with more than 10 CPU cores, you must download Windows ADK Compatibility Manager and create your own database fix that tricks your PC into thinking it has less cores than it actually does. Then, you must lock your all software and hardware to run at 60fps and turn off V-SYNC. I'd recommend replacing your EXE with v1.0 to remove the DLC packs and manually replacing/renaming the DATA files in order to unlock the previously inaccessible Conduit Rooms.
So with a bit of work, you can get this game working. But there is still no Severed DLC solution so EA can suck my nuts, the negative review stays. | Cumple, pero hasta ahi nomas. Pienso que añadieron cosas totalmente desviadas a lo que se venía viendo en la historia, reciclan un montón de zonas, meten muchos bichos al pedo cada 2x3, está extremadamente bugueado, etc, etc, etc.

7 / 10. | It is a fun game. LOL got scared more by the steam(Fire sprinklers) than the necromorph jumpscare's. | This game is an excellent sequel to the first, it plays better, it looks better. Altough, it is a shame that Dead Space 2: Severed (DLC) only came out on consoles.
It has the best level design of all 3 games, if we don't count the remake, where the ishimura is interconected, it's scarier and you can feel more tension throughout the game.

It combines logical thinking, physics-based mechanics, and an engaging story. The game takes place in Aperture Science, a mysterious and dangerous laboratory filled with test chambers. The player controls Chell, a silent protagonist who must escape using the Portal Gun. This device allows players to create two linked portals on surfaces, making it possible to teleport and solve puzzles.

One of the most impressive aspects of Portal 2 is its level design. Each test chamber introduces new mechanics, forcing players to think creatively. The game starts with simple puzzles but gradually becomes more complex. Elements like light bridges, propulsion gel, and lasers add depth to the challenges. The difficulty curve is perfect, making the game enjoyable for both beginners and experienced players.

Portal 2 also stands out with its story and humor. The main antagonist, GLaDOS, is a sarcastic and witty AI who constantly insults and manipulates the player. Wheatley, a clumsy and funny robot, adds another layer of comedy. Their dialogues make the game more entertaining and memorable. Despite its humor, the story also explores themes of control, identity, and artificial intelligence.

Another great feature of Portal 2 is its cooperative mode. Unlike the single-player campaign, co-op requires teamwork and communication. Players control two robots, Atlas and P-Body, solving puzzles that require coordination. This mode enhances the experience, making it even more enjoyable when played with a friend.

Overall, Portal

Make no mistake, this game has nothing to do with the tower defense genre, and everything to do with being a shameless re-imagining of the classic 8-bit game Qix. That sounds like it would be a bad thing, but the truth is that Qix was a rad game when it released in 1981, and Fortix 2 truly feels like what would happen if the developers of Qix had time-traveled 30 years into the future at the start of development. 

Qix featured a simple mechanic, slickly implemented, with a presentation that was unremarkable but serviceable for its day. The exact same thing is true for Fortix 2. This is not a complicated game, but it is a great implementation of a simple mechanic. The difficulty curve is pitch-perfect, making finishing a level without losing any lives achievable but challenging. 

Fortix 2 isn't going to blow anyone away, but it does an excellent job of filling that spot in your Steam library for a game that doesn't ask for much in the way of investment, and can be consumed in 5-minute increments while still feeling rewarding, and for $2 or less, you can't really ask for more. | This game is sooo enjoyable! its also srsly a good choice if you dont want to use your mouse!

I wouldn't call it a reverse tower defense tho. But let's leave it at that. Now about the game itself. The grafix are good if you like that style. I do admit it is rather adorable. A 30 level addictive challenge. I find this casual game highly enjoyable. If you played the first one than you can consider Fortix 2 the improved version. The gameplay stays the same, just like most levels. If you prefer the retro look then this one is nothing for you! | Otra idea brillante rescatada de ese pasado tan sabio.
Fortix 2 Supera en todo, como buena segunda parte, a Fortix.
Lo que más valoro es que es diferente al original. No han hecho el mismo juego ampliandolo, si no que lo han retocado completamente, muy profesionalmente. El resultado es una segunda parte que se ha superado.

Muy recomendado para todo el mundo como juego a jugar. El nivel imposible es un verdadero reto que no es frustrante, por ello y para aprovechar el juego en todo su esplendor recomiendo completar los niveles en imposible.

制限マップや陣取り不可オブジェなどがあったりします

ここから先はimpossible等の高難易度の話

前作同様高難易度になると高頻度に高速弾や高速誘導弾が砲台から発射されますが
これが非常に曲者で規則性がないため完全に安全行動を取るには場所によって
2ドット程度の前進しか出来ない場所があったりします

ノーミスでいくにはかなり慎重に行動を取らねばならないにも
関わらず今作は制限時間がかなり厳しく調整されており慎重かつ素早く
といった作業をドット単位の精密コントロールで行う必要があります
ほんの3ドット進んだだけでもすぐ側の砲台が弾を出せば終わりという
凄まじい不条理感を味わうこともままあります

ちなみに1同様私の環境だとキーボードが安物なためかどうにも入力がうまくいかないことが
あるためそういった操作ミスがあると尚更しんどくなってしまいます
高難易度をやりこむ場合にはレスポンスがしっかりしたKBかコントローラー推奨です

また左上等の2箇所同時押しをした場合には先に押した方向に入力が入り続けます
このため上、左、下と移動して陣を最小限で取りたい時にちょっとでも同時入力があると
その分移動距離が伸びてしまいそれが原因で事故ることになります
後に押した方に移動してくれれば操作性でストレスがかかることはなさそうなのですが…
ただ必ず先に横に拡大しておきそれから前進するジグザク法を使えばそれも問題はありません

かなり高難易度でありながらレスポンスにちょっと不満があるという感じなので
クリア後も達成感というよりはやっと片付いたという感じの方が強いです

76561197970569635,105300,Critical Mass,1.1666666666666667,"Casual, Indie",0,"Critical Mass is an action puzzle game where you match colored blocks to remove them.  The more of a color you remove, the bigger the combo. This review is from a disabled gamer (I only play with a mouse).

http://youtu.be/a6Kdsyvsaks

Loading the game, you can easily access options and change the game to Windowed Mode.  Windowed Mode is borderless so you can change windows without exiting the game.  There's multiple resolutions you can set the window too.  It also has Colorblind Mode which adds a symbol in addiction to the blocks color.  Another option I was impressed with was the Mouse Button option that let's you swap each buttons role.  There's also a single option for the mouse but it seemed to be picky on exactly where I cllicked which slowed me down.  I opt'd to keep using  the reversed option.

Actual game modes include Classic, Survival, Meditation and Rush.  While most modes do require you to work within various time tables, Meditation is a completely untimed relaxing strategic gameplay.  To play the game, rotate the mass with your left mouse button and place blocks with your right mouse button. Many games actually didn't require much rotation so I completed many levels using only 1 mouse button.

If you're a mouse user who can left & right click gameplay should be a breeze!  Colorblind gamers should also be fine with colorblind option enabled.  It's actually my favorite way to play. | I hate bashing on Ozzie companies. ;p And this isn't an evil, unplayable game. My first impression was good, I played it for a bit, expected to play more, had it installed forever, yet every time I fire it up, I close it after 5 minutes.

It's a match 3 game with some 3D tetris elements. The concept is good. The graphics are polished. The music isn't bad. The controls feel annoying at first, but they're actually mostly okay. The problem is, the gameplay doesn't feel satisfying. It expects (and rewards, scorewise) big combos and long term strategy. It also expects you to be fast and responsive. This should theoretically work, in that zen-like way games like this work, but it doesn't. The rythym and pacing feels all off, it feels like the speed jumps from 1,2,3,4,5 to 50 to 150. Once you get into the zone and start planning ahead for later big score combos, it feels like you blink and the game jumps speed, asking you to go for quick, ""just don't make a mistake"" placement. That may be totally subjective of course, or it could be that the feeling gets exacerbated by the clunky cube placement process. It simply isn't visually always obvious or easy to correctly target the location you want on a constantly rotating cube, which really hurts the game when it picks up speed. People misplace blocks on tetris too, but usually feel it's their fault, here it feels like the cube jumps place three times before you can be sure it's where it should be. By which time the game has jumped two speed gears and you're basically done with.

Again, not a bad game, in theory. I just never feel like playing it long, because it doesn't feel very enjoyable. The thumbs down is just trying to balance a ""very positively"" reviewed game, with an 80 something metacritic score that few people seem to actually play much (notice the curiously short play times of the majority of the positive reviewers?). So I'd suggest to approach with caution, and at least play the demo first. | They weren't kidding when they wrote up the description for this little gem. Brutally simple to learn, simply brutal to master, Critical Mass is the kind of game literally anybody can just pick up and waste hours upon hours of their lives playing, all in a vain attempt to top the charts. And don't think for a second I mean any of that in a bad way. Far from it; Critical Mass possesses a fun, addictive quality rivaled only by the likes of Tetris and similar titles.

In case you still have doubts, bear in mind that this game only costs a measely two bucks, so it won't be a serious dent in your pocketbook even if you turn out to be one of the four or five people globally who don't enjoy it (you know who you are). With that in mind, what do you have to lose? I pride myself for being more discriminating than most when it comes to choosing which games to buy with a rather limited budget, so believe me when I say Critical Mass is a nearly fool-proof purchase! | I keep getting this error when I start the game:

76561197970569635,48000,LIMBO,10.383333333333333,"Action, Adventure, Indie",2,"Limbo is a timeless indie masterpiece that redefined the puzzle-platformer genre with its minimalist yet deeply atmospheric approach. Developed by Playdead, the game immerses players in a haunting monochromatic world filled with mystery and danger.

The striking black-and-white visuals, combined with a chillingly minimalist sound design, create an eerie and unsettling atmosphere that grips you from start to finish. The puzzles are clever, intuitive, and seamlessly tied to the environment, offering just the right balance of challenge and satisfaction.

What makes Limbo stand out is its ability to tell a profound, thought-provoking story without a single word of dialogue. Its themes of survival, loss, and exploration resonate deeply, making it more than just a game, it's an experience.

For fans of atmospheric and emotionally driven games, Limbo is an absolute must-play. Its influence on the indie game scene is undeniable, and its haunting world will stay with you long after you’ve reached the end. | 有些地方纯粹是恶心人的，搞那种很极限的操作，这又不是跑酷游戏，况且操作本来就不流畅 | 知道为什么最后通关的人只有不到1/3吗（通关成就玩家29%），因为全部通关之后最后的剧情部分卡住了，要么调低帧率（看别人说这么搞可以，我自己调到60帧也没用，该卡还是卡），要么不断esc当ppt来看（为了一个成就我真是这么搞得，连点器都搞了半小时）
游戏嘛，最开始感觉设计挺巧妙的，很多用物理原理才能搞过去，但玩到后面的时候真的玩不下去了，就感觉设计师只在按他的想法走，关卡设计的一个比一个阴间，没引导好累，最后五关全部看攻略过的，虽然看攻略时能感受到巧妙，但确实也能感受到无语，就是图上没有任何引导，哪怕暗示啥的都没有，但的确又有一个新的空间你不知道，没有空间里的箱子你通不了关……
只能说好坏参半吧，刚开始觉得新鲜有趣，好巧妙啊；后面感觉本来就是小游戏的简单重复还藏着掖着，不给你提示，让你去猜，我猜nm呢的感觉 | LIMBO, zorlu ve zaman zaman sinir bozucu bulmacalarıyla dikkat çekiyor. Ufak hatalar sizi en başa döndürebilir, ancak bu da oyunun heyecanını artırıyor. Farklı gizli bölgeleri keşfederek başarımlar kazanabilirsiniz. INSIDE kadar keyifli olmasa da daha zorlu bulmacalar ve farklı bir tema sunuyor. Keyifli ama bir o kadar da sabır gerektiren bir deneyim. | 比起inside，这部的全成就堪称恶心至极，隐藏关卡玩得窝火，死亡少于五次通关那个更是沙比"

What started off as a PC exclusive and the first and biggest land-mark in FPS and RPG gaming history a decade ago came full circle

This game pretty much stays true to the original, for the most part. As you face enemies, you have various ways of knocking them out, killing them, permanently immobilizing them, maiming them using world objects, etc. For almost each one of your engagements, you will get a mini report indicating the effectiveness of your actions. You will then be rewarded the skill points to make your next upgrade.

The inventory is realistic enough - you cannot carry tons of weapons and you get to arrange and re-arrange your items Resident Evil 4 style

In general, the game feels and plays like a stylish noir with an engaging narrative that feels new and refreshing. Must buy! | [h1]Человек считает, что у него есть право расширять, поглощать и изменять или овладевать всем, что может понадобиться для достижения его мечты. Но, сколько раз это приводило к конфликтам с теми, кто верит в то же самое?[/h1]

«Deus Ex: Human Revolution» - это третья игра из вселенной «Deus Ex» и по мне она была, есть и будет самой лучшей в серии. 
Уже с самого начала геймплея ощущается, что вас ждёт захватывающее приключение в этом стильном и проработанном мире киберпанка, и с каждой минутой, проведённой в ней данное чувство становится всё сильнее и сильнее. 

Из плюсов этой игры вас ожидают:
- Практически совершенный и вариативный геймплей;
- Уникальная система прокачки и улучшений, позволяющие ещё больше разнообразить прохождение;
- Отлично проработанный мир в киберпанк стиле;
- Система диалогов, способная держать в напряжении, ведь от ваших действий зависит то, каким способом будет получена нужная информация;
- Продвинутая боевая система, которая не даст вам заскучать на протяжении долгого времени;
- Сюжет, держащий в напряжении до самого конца;
- Атмосферный саундтрек, в особенности главная тема;
- Уникальные и хорошо проработанные дополнительные квесты.
Не обошлось в данном шедевре и без минусов, которые можно пересчитать по пальцам одной руки, но тем не менее они присутствуют и вот главные из них:
- Устаревшая даже для своего времени графика и анимация;
- Вторая половина игры, которая откровенно слабее первой и не способна постоянно держать в тонусе из –за своего некого однообразия.

Но не стоит отчаиваться, ведь достоинства в разы перевешивают эти незначительные недостатки, а значит ,что данная игра придётся по вкусу практически всем. Не рекомендую только тем, кто уж очень не любит Киберпанк, но даже таким людям сама механика игры может понравиться настолько, что они забудут о стиле и будут крошить всех налево и направо, ну или будут бесшумными ниндзя.

Оценка: 9.0 баллов | Deus Ex was mostly fantastic! The game has you play as Adam Jensen, a guy who definitely didn't ask for this.

The controls and the movement and the styling of the game is all superb; perhaps a little lacking on the ""generic bad guys standing in the halls"" graphics, but what else is new. 

The gameplay is fun and intuitive, and provides a huge, huge wealth of story. Which, is what the game mainly comprises of. If you want an all-action shooty game, you'll have an ""okay"" time in Deus Ex. If you want an enthralling, twisty ""ohmigoshnohedidnt"" story, with tonnes of little snippets and extras to unlock ingame then this is the game for you.

Loads of fun, loved every minute!

-Nilesy | Удивительная игра, которая изначально не вызывает большого интереса, но чуть позже с развитием сюжета, приходит ощущение удовольствия от игры, игра хоть и не сочетает в себе интересные элементы режима стрельбы, но имеет большое количество отдельных плюсов, ради которых стоит потратить свое время."

But its sad the downfall of this series started here. | This game is too classic not to play multiple times. I've played through the entire game at least three times back in the Xbox 360 days. While dated, I would give this game a 10/10 even in 2025. | Played through the entire thing with a friend, and I gotta say, after all these years of playing it, this was still amazing.

Куча мата, насилия, и пошлых шуток + весёлый, местами драматичный сюжет. 
минусов нет | its a good game but its a little too wacky compared to what came before it since the devs were tired of being called a gta clone, and it feels a little too over the top to me even in the first 40 mins, also the framerate is kinda all over the place like one second it goes from 120 to 80fps or so randomly while driving, if you can get past all the minor issues in this game then it seems to be pretty alright, just not my thing"
76561197970569635,102600,Orcs Must Die!,30.116666666666667,"Action, Indie, Strategy",14,"Интересный представитель жанра, но для первого знакомства не рекомендую.
Контента не очень много, если сравнивать со среднестатистическими конкурентами, вроде ""Plants vs. Zombies"", ""Defender's Quest"" и даже ""Space Run"". И я сравниваю именно с играми в жанре башенной защиты, хотя это не точное сравнение, ведь ""Orcs Must Die!"" скорее боевик от третьего лица.
Оценивать игру в сравнении с другими похожими не хочется, потому что они будут иметь, очевидно, похожие недостатки. А оценивать в вакууме, в отрыве ото всех игр вообще - тоже, потому что персонаж там уже изолирован на небольших аренах, как в серии Painkiller.
Баги портят общее впечатление - от проваливающихся в текстуры врагов до люстр, замирающих при падении в баррикадах. Был даже баг, когда началась новая волна, хотя у прежней всё ещё был живой и здравствующий гоблин-шаман.
Поиск пути у врагов периодами выдаёт финты и заставляет застревать в самых неожиданных местах.
Баланс тоже далёк от творческой свободы - при кажущемся обилии ловушек, оружия, стражей и улучшений, у них не так много гибкости при размещении, и синергии между всем этим обилием очень мало.

Основной шарм в юморе и динамике, в постоянном давлении со стороны противника, а также в относительной свежести подхода на период выхода игры. Однако основная идея всех игр жанра Tower Defense в том, что игрок доминирует над положением и выстраивает большей частью автономную защиту, тогда как эта игра ближе к боевику, учитывая количество урона, которое должен наносить сам главный персонаж, бегая по арене, и возможностей выстроить автономную защиту здесь нет. Если же сравнивать игру с другими боевиками, то эта постоянная изоляция делает её очень скудной и однообразной.
Ярым поклонникам жанра, конечно же, лучше ознакомиться; тем более, если на всю серию уже регулярны высокие скидки от 80% и более. | Como la mayoría, habrán jugado este juego en versión pirata sin completar el juego. Ahora que lo tengo acá y lo completé, pues si valió la pena. (Consejo: mejora si o si a los guardianes, me lo agradeceras). | Es entretenido, aunque se le notan mucho los años y que fue la base para esta saga. El 2 es bastante mejor a pesar de no tener mucha diferencia entre entregas, y además tiene cooperativo (cosa que el primero no tiene) así que recomendaría jugar a este solo si tienes curiosidad por como fue el primero. | 童年经典塔防游戏了，自己是从二代跟基友联机开始入坑的，现在正版补票，只可惜这代只能单人游玩。 | I'm not super great at this game, and though I wanted to play more of it I just didn't have the time it takes to put into it. That said, I think it's pretty well made and does everything you'd want it to for this type of tower defense game. I really hope someday I can get back to it and really get into this series."

    [*][b]Un apocalipsis con una carga emocional brutal:[/b] Más allá de los zombis, el verdadero terror del juego es la lucha por la humanidad.

Si buscas una historia que te haga sentir, sufrir y cuestionarte, The Walking Dead 1 es una experiencia inolvidable. No es solo un juego, es un viaje emocional que deja cicatrices. A pesar de sus problemas técnicos, su narrativa y personajes lo convierten en un título imprescindible.

Quase 13 anos jogando esse jogo na pirataria e assistindo vários streamers/youtubers jogando, agora estou finalmente jogando twd oficialmente, não tem como esquecer do primeiro jogo que você chorou. Essa franquia e os personagens são muito especiais para mim e tenho um carinho enorme com a comunidade de jogadores que amam esse jogo.

Praticamente um dos pioneiros dos jogos de escolhas narrativos desse estilo de 'apontar e clicar' (acho que o primeiro foi Heavy Rain), The Walking Dead da Telltale sempre será atemporal com sua narrativa, depois de jogar acho que vai ser difícil esquecer do jogo de zumbi com a menina do boné com um D na estampa chamada Clementine e seu salvador Lee Everett.

Incrível do começo ao fim, bem construído com 4 episódios com inicio, meio e 'continua no próximo episódio' perfeitos para te fazer continuar a jogar, e o quinto episódio te fazendo jogar o segundo jogo.

Como é aquela palavra mesmo? ""Masterpiece""? Com certeza esse jogo é isso!

I only wish the devs didn't turn off my ability to continue buying the rest of the expansions.

Bought the game years ago, now I cant play it anymore because servers got shut down as they need to sell their new game. And what happens with my money? Not even a discount on new release. Shame. | I'd recommend this and the tabletop version of the game.
Unfortunately Marmalade Studios, the new owners of the Intellectual Property (IP) for the electronic version haven't extended the licence to existing purchasers, nor have they (as far as I'm aware), offered a discount to encourage us to 'upgrade' to their new version; an attitude that will likely reduce their potential reach and the overall value of that IP.

A few relatively minor complaints aside, Borderlands 2 improves not only the narrative, but almost every major game system. If you’ve been itching for a reason to jump back into the world of Pandora, Borderlands 2 provides a more than ample supply.The hook of Borderlands 2, the very reason that I found myself thinking about it when I worked or tried to fall asleep, is the loot. Guns, ammo, character skins, grenade mods, class mods -- there’s always something just a bit better, something you so desperately didn’t even know you needed until you found it in Borderlands 2. Just like Diablo or a number of other action RPGs, the hunt for loot becomes intoxicating because of the tiny rush you get each time a rare colored item spills out of a chest or is dropped by a recently slain enemy. Every firefight and intense boss battle becomes all the more rewarding, because, though you might die a few times and want to crush something near you in real life, it suddenly feels like everything is going to be OK when you’re blasting away enemies with a newly looted gun. | só tem gente perturbada, armas, violência, animais perigosos, uma milicia que quer controlar tudo, nenhum policial á vista e um ambiente inóspito a vida humana.

 | Щоб пограти в неї в кооперативі (чим ми й займалися), довелося встановлювати сторонній софт, аби гра хоча б через LAN могла підключатися. Це зайняло багато часу на розв’язання проблем і працювало не дуже стабільно, але пройти гру було можливо — що ми й зробили.

У цілому, суть гри зводиться до одноманітного знищення мобів і босів та лутінгу.

Можливо, на нижчих рівнях складності баланс кращий, а може, навпаки, занадто легкий — не знаю.

Сюжет цілком нормальний для такого жанру, графіка хороша, анімації скілів чудові, та й у цілому прокачування кожного персонажа цікаве.

なんか中途半端なレビューがのこっているので最後に更新しておこうかと..
まあ個人的には500時間程度プレイしているのでかなり楽しんだ方です。
課金もsteamでセールやっていたときに二つほど買いました。
(3つの課金文化の追加と課金で追加される3つのゲームモードかな)
その他の課金はしていません。

ちなみに私個人の腕前は正直決してうまい人といえないばかりか
普通に対戦すると数分でつぶされるレベルです。
序盤戦略は固まっていたのでその手順を理解して以下にそれを効率よく配分するか..
このタイプのものは全部そうなる可能性が高そうですね。
成長速度が段違いすぎてcoopやる時に散々迷惑かけました。
そしてそこまで腕を磨かないままプレイを続けたので
難易度高いミッションは序盤で時間かかりすぎて敵につぶされる感じでした。
ちょっとコツを教えてもらった時は下の上ぐらいにはなったが..

最終的には一応すべての文化をレベル最大にしました。
おそろく実装されたクエストはギリシャ文化で95%ぐらいまではクリアしています。
でもレベル最大になるとでてくる勢力争いはフレンドが誘ってくれたものと
簡単ではないが攻略方があるもの以外はクリアはできなかったです。
また、このゲームはアイテム、アドバイザーなどで同一文化でも
もっている人ともってない人では差がでてました。
一応全部ではないですがそれを売ったり、買ったり、交換することは可能です。
トレードチャットに張り付いた時期もありました。

あんまり高い評価は得られなかったですが結構面白かったです。
いろいろ特殊なゲームモードなども作ろうとした時期もありましたが
初期の失敗が響いて結局それを十分に取り返せなかった感じでしょうか？

AoEOnline uses a special quest-based RTS system, in which you play pre-made quests and improve your army, but both Skirmish and defense mode is available in DLC,and quest itself is more like skirmish.The Free2Play part is a demo for the game and many stronger items is disabled, including those you get in quest. This is not a pay2win game once you paid and left the demo, strange but true. 
This can be considered a spiritual successor for AoE2, though a little amount of feature in AoE3 also made their way here. | Игра могла бы стать великолепной, если бы не жадность разработчиков.

The community of this game is unlike any other I've ever encountered in an online group. They are vindictive, rude and destructive to the game. Throughout the entire time I played I suffered no end of trolling, mocking and the like. There were people that literally exploited the kicking function to get me off of servers so I could not play the game I paid for. 
The issue also lies with the developers whom constantly ignored community begging to get hackers out. Even to this day, after an anti-cheat patch, the game is STILL cracked, people running around with weapons they shouldn't, running fast, swinging faster than is possible. Some people even exploit the bad latency issues to win. 

There's a top 1% in this game, they are not skilled players by any stretch. Instead of skill they got together and figured out what the best ways to exploit the games mechanics. From unblockable hits to builds that were simply insanely unfair, they scared away any new players to the game by trying their best to ruin the fun for others. To this day, even now, I get on and someone is taking my Steam ID name so they can spam vote kicks so I can't play. 

Stay far, far away from this game. Think of World of Warcraft only cultivated with the worst of the worst (community) possible.

[b][h1]Какие же достоинства есть у роз?[/h1][/b]
[list]
[*] Приятная графика
[*] Настройка оружия, разные виды оружия
[*] Возможность создать своих уникальных персонажей (при покупке полной версии, естественно)
[*] Неплохая боевая система, прямо как в Mount&Blade
[*] Наличие дуэльных серверов, где запрещены лучники, толпой на одного лезть нельзя и можно потренироваться.
[/list]
[b][h1]Теперь к недостаткам:[/h1][/b]
[list]
[*] Система ударов и блоков реализована, ИМХО, криво, хотя задумка [b]правильная[/b]. В Mount&Blade похожая система, но там если хочешь ударить [b]сверху[/b], то и ударяешь [b]сверху[/b], а тут так бывает далеко не всегда.
[*] Куча игроков-спамеров, которые размахивают без конца [b]двуручным[/b] оружием, [b]вообще не делая блоки[/b], а ты просто не успеваешь заблокировать атаки, ибо некоторые двуручники, видимо, ничего не весят, и спамить ими можно на ура, даже при промахах
[*] Ограничения на количество лучников в команде не было и нет, очень весело становится, когда ими все кишит - бегаешь и умираешь чуть что. А еще учитывая возрождение возле лидера - пять лучников могут собраться в один отряд и стрелять, сколько душе угодно, возрождаясь сразу же на удобных позициях. Я то и не против самих лучников, но нужно или увеличить время респавна для них, если их много, или запретить возрождаться возле лидера. Повторюсь, ЕСЛИ ИХ МНОГО. Несколько лучников придает бою адреналина, а куча - напрочь убивает удовольствие.
[*] Раздражают ролики с собственной казнью от первого лица. Пусть будет выбор - отображать ролики с казнью или просто надпись внизу ""вас прикончили"". Почему мне навязывают жестокость, не давая выбора? 
[*] Серверов мало, игроков мало, нужно подбирать время, чтобы были заполненные и с хорошим пингом
[*] На ДУЭЛЬНЫХ серверах почему-то [b]разрешены казни[/b]. Что за чертовщина? Этикет таких серверов подразумевает запрет на казни в принципе, разработчики же не пожелали сделать кпопочку в настройках сервера ""запретить казни"", они оставили все на контроль админам серверов, которые как бы должны наказывать нарушителей и которые на сервере не столь часто, к тому же бывает, что на ДУЭЛЬНОМ сервере админ ни черта не банит, как будто так и надо. Я молчу про кучу лучников и наезд толпой,  вообще-то запрещенных на таких серверах, на которые тоже некоторым админам пофигу.
[*] Где баланс  команд по уровню прокачанности? Не завезли.
[*] Лаги, лаги, лаги. С 2012 года разрабы все никак не могут оптимизировать движок и до сих пор те, у кого компьютеры тянут всякие крайзисы с батлфилдами на максимальных, и интернет хороший, недоумевают, какого черта так лагает
[*] Разрабам положить на игру. Ну вот серьезно, гляньте на список исправлений,  даже античит выкатывался достаточно долго.
[*] Доспехи порезаны не напильником, а болгаркой, теперь тяжелые носить смысла нет, ибо теряешь в скорости, а взамен - только защита от бокового удара мечом и кинжала.

Of the 140 hours I've played, roughly 100 of them were spent on dueling servers fighting 1on1 with other players, all of whom were there because they enjoyed the actual competition or to master their skills with a new weapon. The dueling community was strong and friendly, always willing to help teach new players how to survive the game. 

But then the Devs changed things, the armor system simplified, the weapons became more powerful, crossbows became sniper rifles, hitboxes and crit chances grew, and the art of dueling was lost to the ether; replaced by polearm decapitations, across the map crossbow headshots, and stab spamming. All that is left now is the empty rotting shell of a once great game. | This game has an absolutely TERRIBLE community. It's absolutely toxic and leaves to room for enjoyment. This game is fun, but there is nothing but people you never want to meet in person. 

It's disgusting. Sadly, it ruins the game entirely. Duel servers are the worst hands down, filled with people who are both hypocritical, and completely immature.

I'd skip this one for the community alone. | Als das Spiel noch einen normalen Preis hatte war es sehr gut.
Die Grafik überzeugt und das Gameplay fand ich zu der Zeit noch ansprechender als das von seinem Marktbegleiter (Chivalry Medival Warfare).
Gerade weil man den Charakter weitergehend modifizieren konnte und man direkt auf Waffen sparen konnte.
Die Kämpfe haben Spaß gemacht und auch als Bogenschütze waren die Kämpfe anspruchsvoll aber nicht unfair.

Inzwischen ist alles anders.
Seit das Spiel Freemium (Free2Play) ist, sind die Preise der Waffen und Rüstungsteile um Faktor X gestiegen.
Inzwischen kosten fast alle waffen 100.000 Gold (umgerechnet 5-10 €?). Und das ohne weitere Upgrades.
Da die Waffen aber alle unterschiedliche Stats haben und man eine tatsächliche Ewigkeit bräuchte um das Geld in Schlachten zu verdienen ist das Spiel zu Pay2Win verkommen.

Ganz zu schweigen von den ganzen Griefern und Glitchern die selbst Standard-DM zur Hölle machen.
Rennen weg, springen auf Zäune/Dächer/Palmen(?) und verstecken sich irgendwie in Heuballen, die man selbst weder betreten kann - noch bei denen man in der Lage ist Schaden zuzufügen.
Während ich früher (Großteil meiner Spielzeit) mit positiven Stats aus dem Spiel gehn konnte.. wäre es jetzt wohl eine KD von 1/10. Ich nehme auch an dass das Game inzwischen hackerverseucht ist.. wills aber auch nicht wissen.

76561197970569635,234160,Strike Suit Infinity,0.5,"Action, Indie",0,"An arcade space ship shooter with a small mech-type component to it. Depending on which of the three platforms you choose from it can range in its level of difficulty. The controls are tight enough with the keyboard and mouse, but the gameplay can get repetitive as you continually progress through the levels with the latter levels really supplying bullet-sponge enemies at times.

The main objective, beyond beating each of the levels is to score the highest score in each level to earn increasing letter grades. Enemies come at you in waves, with the waves getting slightly more difficult with each new wave that comes through. Capital ships usually show up in the end waves, but as you progress through the levels they become more common earlier on. Destroying the capital ships nets you credits, so it can be helpful to destroy them as quickly as possible.

The capital ships are filled with turrets and weak points that can be targeted for destruction. Depending on which of the three ships you pick it can range from easy to difficult to destroy the turrets in a timely fashion. Weak points can also be a bit odd in their hit boxes at times, which can cause a bit of frustration as you work against the clock. There are bonus rounds, but the capital ships appearing during these sections are rare, but can net you some additional credits.

Using the credits you can purchase reinforcements to help you out on a level by level basis. If they survive the level you get your credits back so you can hire the same ships again the next level. While they can be useful in the earlier levels, they begin to lose their effectiveness once you get to the ""Elite"" enemies. You can always upgrade their effectiveness, but even at the highest levels they're still mostly just cannon fodder, that can be used to distract from you being the sole target.

Each ship can transform into it's ""mech"" version as you fill the ""Flux"" bar. Each shot of your weapons (gun or missles) will drain this bar slightly, once it's empty you auto-switch back to your standard space ship mode. There's two perspectives you can fly in as well, cockpit view or a 3rd person camera directly behind the ship. So you can enjoy it either mode, without any real changes to the gameplay. 

I enjoyed the game, as you can tell by the 100% achievement mark I've gotten in it. The arcade-y ness of it can help you get a bit of extra enjoyment from it if you like trying for additional points to beat your previous runs. For me, once I beat the game, I've only really come back to it a few times but I remember those times being fun regardless. For around $7 (US) it's a decent enough game if you like space ship shooters."

Але важко уявити, що в 2025 році ми все ще змушені бачити у світі ігор проросійські наративи. У новій версії гри розробники ""відзначилися"" черговим ігноруванням української локалізації та повного ігнорування української нації, яка переживає героїчну боротьбу за своє існування та незалежність.  

Анонс нового персонажа, цариці-душогубки, яка нав'язується як ""символ культури та просвітництва"", виглядає як зневага до мільйонів українців. Героізація імперіалістичної постаті — це не тільки обурливо, але й аморально в контексті війни та окупації, яку сьогодні переживає наша країна.  

Українці заслуговують на повагу в індустрії відеоігор, а не на спроби просувати імперський наратив під виглядом ""культурних цінностей"". Досить толерувати пропаганду! Вимагаємо повноцінної української локалізації, українських героїв і персонажів, які реально відображають нашу історію, культуру та боротьбу.

It's hard to believe that in 2025 we are still witnessing pro-Russian narratives in the gaming industry. In the latest version of the game, the developers once again ignored Ukrainian localization and completely erased the Ukrainian nation, which is heroically fighting for its survival and independence.  

The announcement of a new character, a tsarina-murderer being portrayed as a ""symbol of culture and enlightenment,"" is a slap in the face to millions of Ukrainians. Glorifying an imperialist figure is not only outrageous but also immoral in the context of the war and occupation Ukraine is enduring today.  

Ukrainians deserve respect in the gaming industry, not an attempt to promote imperial narratives disguised as ""cultural values."" Enough with the propaganda! We demand full Ukrainian localization, Ukrainian heroes, and characters that truly reflect our history, culture, and struggle."

Германия в окружении, сражается из последних сил. Союзники с запада и Красная армия на востоке продолжают сжимать кольцо окружения Германии.

[h2]Сюжет:[/h2]
Элитный снайпер Карл Фейберн отправляется на своё последнее задание во Второй мировой войне-ликвидировать немецких учёных, разработавших ракеты Фау-2 (V2) и не допустить их запуск на Лондон, паралельно с этим, не дать учёным перейти на сторону русских.

[h2]Геймплей:[/h2]
Казалось бы, играешь за обычного снайпера. Бери винтовку, целься, стреляй. Однако, стоит поставить высокую сложность, как игра тут же преображается. Необходимо учитывать дыхание, сердцебиение; направление ветра, влияющее на полёт пули, также следует целится выше, т.к траектория пули снижается при полёте. Уровни здесь линейные, но имеющие множество путей прохождения. Можно сворачивать шеи врагам сзади, можно бесшумно стрелять из велрода. Отвлечь врага камнем, ставить ловушки, растяжки, мины для тяжёлой техники. Пользуясь шумом, можно замаскировать выстрел из снайперской винтовки. Главной фишкой всей серии Sniper Elite - это рентген-камера во время убийства; с каждой последующей частью она становилась лучше, масштабнее и эпичнее. Можно попасть в глаз, сердце, любую кость, а также в пах (да, Адольф?).

[h2]Музыка:[/h2]
Чего только стоит эпичный саундтрек, написанный композитором Марком Ратерфордом. Эти мелодии, одновременно отдающие дух неизбежного поражения Германии, так и приближения новой войны. Ну как же не упомянуть главную тему игры под названием ""Fatherland"", придающая крутости и брутальности всей франшизе.

Есть корпоративный режим ""Двойка"", где один игрок играет за снайпера и прикрывает наводчика. Сам наводчик в свою очередь выполняет диверсионные действия.

[h2]Итог:[/h2]
Sniper Elite V2 - это отличная игра не только про снайперский экшн, но и песочница, дающая игрокам вариативность прохождения. Такие игры откладываются в памяти игроков на долгое время. Тактика, экшн, отличный геймплей - всё это франшиза Sniper Elite.

Battle mechanism 10/10
-SO MUCH skillset to try
-We can mix and match the skill we need every situation
-VOCATION SYSTEM WAS PERFECT. we can try different role and abilities
-Pawn could help us in the field we lacking (like healer/tank/DPS)
-Cool looking weapon (and have so much type)
-we can climb up the monster, so melee type vocation not gonna suffered a lot. lol

The game itself was not hard, more like challenging in a good way. but every enemy has different pattern, resistence, ability, size, speed, etc. So we need to work our brain out to survive. On the Gransys Map, we could easily win every enemy encountered, with a few exceptional. But SPOILER ALERT: on Bitterblack Isle, better prepared bcs the big guys can one-shot us lol.

The only minus was graphic, i mean this was AN OLD GAME. 1st time released in 2012 (its been 13 years), and the DARK ARISEN released in 2016. So the graphic was outdated. But that was not really a minus for me. I mean, i can feel the dynamic of every law in this game. Like the movement of the animal, the interaction between NPC, the pattern of monsters, the movement of water/wind, changing of weather, the movement of my robe when i walk or run or got drenched, etc. So an old school graphic was not a setback for me. 

At the end, this is a really SOLID GAME, even in the 2024/2025 or sometimes in the future.

There are a number of quality games on Steam that receive negative reviews simply because they don’t fit the head-shape, budget, and/or difficulty level of certain players. If you really want the TL:DR of this review, go and look at the number of hours played by the positive reviews compared to the number of hours played by the negative reviews. I am a 41-year-old professional with a full-time work schedule. As an avid PC gamer that can no longer keep up with the demands of traditional MMO play times, HEX has been a blessing for me. I have been absolutely enamored with the game’s PvP and PvE and I have been steadily improving thanks to a very helpful community.
 
THE PAY MODEL

In order to make a proper determination whether or not HEX is the game for you, you should first understand what this game is and how the pay model works. HEX: Shards of Fate is a trading card game with various PvP and PvE formats. The client can be downloaded without making a purchase and some basic cards as well as all PvE formats can be played free of charge. Additional cards are purchased in packs on a per-pack basis just like real world trading card games like Magic and Pokemon. Cards can be traded among players and bought and sold on the Auction House for either of the game’s currencies. There is Platinum which is purchased with real money and used to buy packs and VIP time, and Gold which is earned by participating in PvE. HEX is not intended to be a Free to Play game. It is a virtual trading, collectable card game that shares aspects of real life card games. In order to fully utilize and appreciate what HEX has to offer you should expect to invest a significant (but reasonable) amount of time and money.

THE ECONOMY

Cards can be bought and sold for both Platinum and Gold on the virtual Auction House. Platinum is originally purchased with real money and is used to buy packs and VIP time. Gold is earned mostly in PvE.  Gold can be used to buy auction house items, Stardust to make cards ‘Extended Art’, and to ‘roll’ on treasure chests which are obtained by buying pack and completing PvE tasks. The HEX economy very nicely allows players with varying preferences of PvP and PvE to exchange desired virtual items. The modest VIP program is free of any Pay-To-Win rewards. Also, you should be aware that there is a robust ‘unregulated’ secondary market where players can sell their collection for real world cash. It’s unsanctioned by Cryptozoic and provides a way for players to receive some of their cash investment back if they decide to move on. This might seem shady at first but it’s akin to going in to your local hobby shop and buying and selling cards there. I put $400 in to Hearthstone and ended up hating the game but since you can’t freely trade cards, I have no way to get any of that back. 

PLAYER VS. EVIROMENT

PvE in HEX currently features two modes of play. There’s a Campaign where you can pick a champion, explore the map, and raid solo dungeons. The other mode is the Frost Ring Arena where you compete with AI controlled champions. The AI difficulty level in both modes is intentionally set at ‘easy’ to ‘medium’ in my estimation. The ‘dumb’ AI is a negative for some players that want a more challenging PvE experience. For most players however, PvE is a form of grinding and the challenge is to figure out deck and equipment designs that can farm the quickest. My favorite aspect of PvE is the Equipment system. Champions can equip certain pieces of armor and weapons that give cards in their decks powerful attributes. It’s a brilliant system that allows for the design of fun, powerful decks in PvE without creating balance issues in PvP.

PLAYER VS. PLAYER

HEX has a number of PvP formats that appeal to a variety of players based on their tastes. There’s Constructed modes that allow a player to use any PvP eligible card in their collection and there are Gauntlets and Draft mode where players use only cards that are obtained by opening packs. Constructed Mode is highly competitive and since players can use any card in their collection, you will need to make an investment to earn the cards that will allow you to be competitive. You can design budget decks that will help you advance up the ladder but you’ll need to invest and collect some nice cards to be a solid competitor. For players that prefer a more ‘level’ competition there’s Gauntlets and Drafts. Cards in this mode are obtained directly from packs that are opened for that tournament. The cards obtained are completely random for each player and it’s up to you to design the best deck possible. After the tournament concludes, the cards obtained are added to your collection and can be used or traded as you see fit. 

THE COMMUNITY AND DEVELOPERS

The community is one of the major selling features to me and is why I enjoy HEX so much. There are a number of excellent guilds <Insert Shameless Plug for Cornerstone> and well-produced guides in the form of videos and blogs. The players here are mature and helpful. Any game with PvP will attract ass-hats of course, but in the two months I’ve been playing, I can count on one hand the number of rude comments that I’ve encountered in chat during a match. The Twitch/Youtube community is excellent and quite often coordinates with Cryptozoic Entertainment. For instance, during the latest patch, a second, pre-patched server was set up so streamers could highlight the upcoming changes during down time. My perception is that Cryptozoic communicates with the player base often and they understand the concerns, needs, and wants of players. I like their transparency regarding their policies and I think their financial model is fair and well done.

CONCLUSION

Like many of you I suffered a long period of MMO’s that became P2W and games that were released too early. I’m truly grateful that I found HEX. Cryptozoic Entertainment is a smaller developer and there’s content and quality of life improvements that all of us want sooner rather than later, but at the end of the day, this is an excellent product. If you’re looking for a hobby to sink your teeth in to or you’re considering trying your first TCG, this is the game for you. HEX is Grade A, bonafide Trading Card Game with gorgeous artwork and easy to learn, difficult to master gameplay. I hope you give it a solid try!

Edited for length conformity. | В первый раз пишу отзыв об игре, но тут прям уже наболело.

Пытаюсь начать в эту ОТЛИЧНУЮ игру почти с самого ее старта, и никак...
Это наверно единственная игра, где я потратил столько сил впустую.
Хочу сразу сказать, что я не TCG профи, есть опыт игры во многие подобные игры на уровне казуала, не более.

Что же предлагает нам HEX чтобы начать играть?
1. Полностью донатный вариант - покупаем платину, на нее покупаем паки и плату за вход в соревнования.
Один пак стоит на ауке около 160 платины.
Вход в драфт стоит 3 пака и 100 платины = 580. Это около 300 рублей.
И было бы ок, но первые 20 раз новичек в драфте обречен на слив. Потому что нужен опыт, которого бесплатно взять в этой игре НЕГДЕ. Вот и приходится платить за сливы.
2. Вариант компромисный - 100 платины покупаем на реал, 3 пака фармим за голду. Могу сказать четко - это бред. 1 пак стоит 25к, в пве хоть какую-то прибыль дает арена, за фулран зарабатываешь 6-7к в 40 минут. Я пофармил, и получается что на один драфт нужно фармить примерно неделю онлайна. То есть ты тупо гоняешь одних и тех же боссов неделю за то чтобы один раз зайти в драфт и слить.
3. Ну больше вариантов нету. Либо ты хорошо драфтишь (гантлетишь) и с первого доната уходишь вверх... либо ты всю жизнь гоняешь компьютерных болванчиков в ""данжах"".
Я бы очень хотел, чтобы была какая-то подписка, рублей за 400 в месяц, которая давала бы хотя бы один вход в турнир в неделю бесплатно. Это была бы хоть какая-то точка старта. А так получается, что там играют одни папки сами с собой.

И я вообще слабо понимаю, зачем делают эту кампанию. Заработать там нельзя, карты для пвп или входы в турниры получить нельзя. В чем вообще смысл то??
Все эти разговоры про ""рейды и гильдии""... Это типа будет собираться 10 человек и мочить компьютерного ОП бота? Не знаю кому это интересно. 

Еще раз, я хочу сказать что я не против платить за игру. Но в текущей реализации - это просто не оправданно. | HEX is by fantastic example of what can be achieved by a true trading card game in the digital space. The quickest way to descibe the game is Magic: The Gathering with a threshold based resource system and unique mechanics that would only be possible in a digital TCG. 

You preserve everything offerred by physical CCGs such as complete open trading system and third party support and add to it a digital auction house, in-game tournament support, ladder system and a respectable single player experience (although admitiedly still shallow compared to their Kickstarter promises) which adds a somewhat viable way to enjoy the mechanics without spending any money.

That is to say, HEX's F2P avenue requires an extreme amount of luck or time if you want to construct some of the most potent PvP decks via only the PvE content. Time in grinding the PvE content until you have enough of the PvE currency to trade for sealed tournament entries and luck in that you do well enough in those sealed tournaments via wins or opening cards that sell well to pay for the next entry fee and make a profit.

To give some perspective to that a sealed tournament entry costs generally $5 and gets 2 boosters ($2 value each) with the potential to get 3 more boosters if you do well enough. Simply getting 1 win gets you an additional booster so that already would put you ahead on base value in addition to keeping the cards you open. In additon, there are multiple rare cards that sell for $1+ and some of the top end cards can go for $20+. If you get lucky enough to snag some of those and sell them on the AH or on the Trade channel you can keep yourself running tournaments for a good while.

I have always been a stickler for dropping money into an online game and not having anything to show for it if I stop playing, but since HEX fully supports trading and third party sites if you ever want to cash out your account you can and depending on how much effort you want to put into selling off your collection you could even turn a profit.

In the future, HEX has promised to flush the single player experience out into a full multiplayer PvE experience with raids and dungeons for players to team up against. Not sure how far off this is and a number of Kickstarters are salty about the delay (rightly so), but as it stands now I fully recommend HEX as being the only digital TCG out there that has a comprehensive feature set, friendly community (Twitch & Reddit) and enjoyable complex strategic gameplay. | I am a F2P Beta player, and have spent many hours grinding the PVE content to build my collection. I have tried a lot of different card games, and Hex is currently my favorite.

GAMEPLAY
If you know how to play MTG, you know how to play Hex. It is your standard “mana” driven TCG. It fully takes advantage of its digital nature, summoning cards from outside your collection, permanently modifying cards, and even completely changing cards in play. This adds a huge layer of strategy as deciding to kill a 1/1 creature by doing one damage or giving it -1/-1 matters when the card remembers its stats even in the discard pile!

ECONOMY / COST
The game has two currencies, Plat (real money) and Gold (in game money). The only time you need Plat is when entering tournaments, everything else can be bought with Gold.

The game has an auction house and the ability to trade with other players. It is a true TRADING card game as opposed to a COLLECTIBLE card game. You can turn Gold into Plat by trading with other players or selling cards in the auction house. 

It is easy to grind Gold, you can challenge the AI in the Arena and get progressively larger rewards for winning (and even if you lose, you keep everything you won up to that point). You also have the campaign which continually rewards money and cards.

STABILITY / LAG

For the most part, the game is stable with reasonable performance. When a new release or event begins, the performance may suffer due to the increased load, but the developers usually handle that fairly quickly and increase the capacity. In my time playing, the performance has gotten better over all.

A few deck strategies are also particularly taxing on the game, such as spider based decks which create massive amounts of creatures. This can be mildly annoying, but usually isn't game breaking. 


TOURNAMENTS
There are regularly occurring constructed and sealed tournaments. There are even queues which you can enter and play at your leisure over days instead of playing all at once. Entry fee is inexpensive and winning gets you packs.

Constructed - This is your standard tournament. Build a deck and play to win. I avoid this as those who spend money clearly have an advantage.

Draft - A fairly well designed mode though there can be a lot of waiting involved. Players draft from a common pool of cards so everyone is on equal ground. The problem is you can have players who simply take the rares for their collection.

Sealed - This is my favorite type of mode as everyone starts on equal footing and you keep all the cards. It is particularly fun to play in “Gauntlet” mode as you can play your 3 to 7 games over however long you want, the pool of opponents constantly refreshes.

PVE / Adventure Zones
Last but not least is the PVE content. You choose a race and class which grants you special abilities and a starting deck. You then travel the world facing various challenges as you help your faction win a war. You can also hire mercenaries which provide you with even more options.

You can play this fairly effectively without spending any money. The opponents are interesting, and there are special PVE cards which are much too powerful or random for PVP games. This also earns you gold which can then be used to buy packs or enter into tournaments. 

I strongly recommend Hex! | This games is very addicting. I never thought an online battle card game could be this fun! 

Pros: Beautiful graphics. Great story line. More control of your cards during battle. I love how you can advance your character with skill trees and customize your deck and character with socketable cards and sets of gear.

Cons: The battle can be a bit tedious at times, especially when you are first starting out. There is not a way to cancel or change your actions before finalizing them (or at least not one that is readily seen).

Overall, this is the best card battle game I have played. It is a bit complex and challenging, but the balance of the complexity and story line/game content is well enough that the player stays engaged."

Para os veteranos que se lembram do original, é um mimo nostálgico imperdível.
Um game obrigatório aos jogadores que buscam jogos de ação. | [h1]DOOM Review: A Masterclass in FPS Revival[/h1]

DOOM is nothing short of a triumphant return to form for one of gaming’s most iconic franchises. From the moment you tear through your first demon, it’s clear that this game isn’t just a reboot—it’s a love letter to the original while boldly forging its own path.

The gameplay is fast, fluid, and unapologetically brutal. The emphasis on movement and aggression creates a relentless pace that’s as exhilarating as it is empowering. Glory kills add a visceral layer of satisfaction, rewarding you for diving headfirst into the action instead of cowering behind cover. This isn’t just another FPS; it’s a pure, adrenaline-fueled experience that reminds you why shooters became so popular in the first place.

The level design is another standout feature, with sprawling, labyrinthine maps that encourage exploration without ever losing momentum. Hidden secrets, upgrades, and collectibles provide plenty of incentives to comb through every corner of the UAC’s Mars facility and the hellish depths beyond.

Mick Gordon’s thunderous soundtrack deserves a special mention. The heavy metal score doesn’t just accompany the gameplay—it amplifies it. Each riff and beat syncs perfectly with the chaos, driving you further into the carnage.

The story is refreshingly simple yet surprisingly effective. It knows it’s not the main attraction and instead focuses on delivering just enough lore to keep things interesting. The Doom Slayer’s disdain for protocol and corporate nonsense injects a layer of humor that contrasts beautifully with the dark, gritty setting.

Visually, DOOM is stunning. The environments are detailed and atmospheric, while the demon designs are grotesque in the best way possible. Every battle feels like it’s taking place in a heavy metal album cover brought to life.

In conclusion, DOOM isn’t just a great game—it’s a reinvention of a genre that many thought had lost its edge. It’s fast, ferocious, and endlessly fun. Whether you’re a long-time fan of the series or a newcomer, this is one hell of a ride you don’t want to miss.

Rating: 9/10. | amazing fps game really nice graphics, sorta short but thats better than it dragging | pos muy buen gameplay el mejor juego que eh jugado y es tremendo para matar demonios si estas enojado por que tu profesor te puso un 3 y ala puta de la gorda de tu salon le puso un 10 por la de anoche pos desaogate con doom (perdon por la ortografia ni ganas de escribir tengo)

Когда еще не было 1pp, и рейтинга. Когда томик, пулемет, м24 был с дропа. Когда были только х4 и х8. И тогда казалось что игра прекрасна.

Да более того думалось что она станет в принципе самой известной игрой про стрельбу. А потом.... Потом, разрабы поняли что корову можно нихуево подоить. И начался классический прогрев гоев на шейкели. Огромное количество скинов, вместо баланса карт и оружия. Всякие эмоции и прочее гавно.

我的力量有人能及啊…


---致我人生第一次玩的卡牌肉鸽神作《杀戮尖塔》
前几日冬促，购买了《杀戮尖塔》这款游戏，在玩之前心里曾想：我玩过那么多个3A大作，怎能会被一个小小的卡牌游戏震撼呢？看着steam好评如潮的评价，心里抱着不理解和尝试的态度，还是打开了游戏。

没错，我摊牌了，我彻底被这个游戏折服，从买完游戏到现在我无时不刻都在玩，目前也差不多一百小时了，如此优秀的游戏玩法和质量已经能超越很多3A大作。

再玩之前，我也确实久仰杀戮尖塔在卡牌肉鸽当中的地位，但是我也确实从来没玩过卡牌肉鸽，《杀戮尖塔》也属于我在肉鸽类游戏中的白月光了吧。确实只有在实际上手之后才能感受到其中的魅力。从最开始的重开在商店里找好遗物，到现在稍微有些对删牌过卡的理解，这种不完全依赖随机而是能够在游戏局内运营、构筑卡牌的机制正是它的魅力所在。同时四个角色特色迥异，相同角色又因为不同的牌组构筑有着不同的打法，再加上几乎毫无门槛的操作，在roguelike游戏的重开-学习的过程中，低挫败感、高成就感、对卡牌的熟悉以及逐渐对角色的理解使得游戏过程不像通常的卡牌roguelike，而更加有趣，能取舍是否该拿牌、是否该移除卡牌、接下来又该怎么构筑，这使该游戏的可重复游玩性大大增加。


前些天终于用战士，猎人和鸡煲把心脏打通关了，也算是对这游戏有些浅薄的理解了

开始玩这游戏的时候，好哥们建议我先玩鸡煲，说是鸡煲转起来特别强，而我也感受到了。

后来哥们和我说，玩战士得学会烧牌，我很诧异，明明每张牌都是我精挑细选的，为什么要把他们烧掉呢？后面理解了，把效率低的卡烧掉后，留下单卡效率最高的卡，打怪效率更高。之后喜欢上了烧牌的感觉，尤其很喜欢腐化，当把其他牌烧干净后，只剩下那几张攻击牌，颇有种破釜沉舟的感觉，就算打不过再sl嘛，把不该烧的牌留下来。

当我研究战士烧牌的时候，我认为战士是一个最需要想象力的职业，玩的时候得靠想象力。

关于杀戮尖塔的赞美太多太多了，我不想去赞美游戏的本身。我印象最深刻的一局是战士第一次打败心脏，因为卡组不太好，强度不高。我腐化黑拥SL一个小时二十次，结局依旧是输。我相信我能赢，我把29张牌牌序列出来，腐化黑拥烧完不同的牌牌序列出来，一个小时后我终于找到了那个解，最后我赢了之后长舒一口气。在那一刻我赢了游戏，在那一刻也赢了时间。或许一个小时我重开一局选牌好早赢了，可是能赢的局我不愿认输。


即使最后我们都会输给时间，这没关系，那也要谱写出每个人自己生命的赞歌。什么是生命的赞歌？或许是藏在人们骨子里的永不屈服、永不妥协、永不认输。

我的人生没办法sl，为了战胜这一路上的小怪，烧过那么多休息牌，娱乐牌，还换了那么多血，这是否真的值得？可惜这个问题的答案没法通过sl去知道了。
现在的我，就想赶快走到下一个篝火休息。人生啊，总是奔向下一个篝火，区别是以前的我会在篝火敲牌，以后我只会休息了。

最后感谢《杀戮尖塔》给我带来一百小时的快乐时光，我现在唯一后悔的就是在大学期末考试期间购买了这款游戏，这游戏真的有瘾啊！😭 | 又开始带鸡煲节奏了我真是服了😅鸡煲是这个游戏唯一的完美职业，已经和尖塔融为一体，成了尖塔的底层逻辑，成名绝技偏差认知给尖塔带来了这个贴吧最经典的话题，创造了尖塔的黄金时代，诋毁鸡煲，你想毁了杀戮尖塔吗？
 | My first 500 hours in Slay the Spire were hours I didn't pay for. 

I was a kid in highschool, broke, there was only 3 characters in the game, Vine was alive and Tiktok had yet to really get a foothold in the world. It was a better time.

And I... sailed the seas. Its not something I'm ashamed of, and if you are down on your luck, still a kid, or just don't feel like jockeying the Steam refund policy to see if you like a game, most game devs would prefer thats how you play their game over buying a copy of dubious origin from a reseller. 

Why even bring this up, you might ask? Well, it was only last year that I realized how much had gone into the game, and that there was a 4th character that I had no clue even existed. And, against my better judgement with regards to my ever disappearing free time, I picked up STS again to try that 4th character. And then I started playing the other characters too. And then I started ascension runs. 

Never in all my days have I encountered such a well crafted deckbuilder. Being singleplayer, STS doesn't care if you find a combo that breaks the game and makes the enemy unable to interact with you. Slay the Spire doesn't try and limit your ceiling, it dares you to go infinite, it [i] wants [/i] you to go infinite. My favorite part of the game is how it encourages offense while putting more than enough wrinkles in your path that you can't just go full zerg rush. Fully indexing into any one thing without accounting for the counters puts you on the path to losing. 

Learning the Watcher, the illusive 4th character I didn't know existed as it got added after I put my 500 [strike] pirated [/strike] pre-purchase hours in has been one of the most enjoyable deckbuilding experiences I've had since... well since I played STS the first time. 

The main thing I was trying to do on the Watcher that was so fun was going infinite. There was a really interesting play pattern you can take where you reset a lot and chop your deck down to like 3 powers and then your 2 card combo that goes until you win. The fun part is that by taking your deck down to so few cards, any enemy that adds cards to your deck in any way is immediately the most threatening thing you could encounter. You also have to make illogical decisions in order to get to infinite. You skip like 90% of cards you are offered, you make sacrifices for some things that would never make sense in a normal run. And that is just ONE way to play the game on one character, completely ignoring everything that comes with ascension runs. 

And all of that is also completely ignoring everything that isn't purely gameplay. The art is amazing, the soundtrack is amazing, the sound DESIGN is amazing, and there has never been a better time to get into Slay the Spire because there is a sequel that looks like its amping up everything about the first game and giving more of what is undeniably one of the grandpappys of indie roguelikes. That would've been a silly statement 10 years ago, but there are so many indie roguelikes now that it can be hard to stand out among them. 

Slay the Spire has stood the test of time and remains at the top of the tower. Play this game, and if you can, uh, pay for it while you're at it... I did. Eventually.

[code] https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42143664/ [/code] | 仅仅是打了个全成就 ，仍然无法全面的评价这个游戏。因为这100个小时里仅仅专精了猎人，还有三个职业只是简单玩了玩。
真的有点惊叹于游戏的设计，仅仅四个角色，仅仅三个区域（算上心脏四个）却可以让一个游戏有着如此大的可玩性。看似重复的遭遇和地图，随着局内带来的各种惊喜（多种多样的道具，卡组搭配，药水选择，随机事件等）和精妙的设计（数值的平衡和关卡的平衡）可以说再玩几百个小时都不会觉得腻。而且这还是我没去更深体验其他三个角色和增加可玩性的mod时的想法。
体验下来确实可以说无与伦比，极其出色的游戏（又到幸运时刻了，今年出2！） | Dangerous dangerous game, whether you are playing it on the go via tablet or have it on steam maybe with mods as well, if this is the right game for you your free time will evaporate. If you like deckbuilding, pve strategy and the like, this is just perfect. If you've got a background in competitive/multiplayer collectable card games, the pve nature of slay the spire enabling you to do some truly unbalanced things will make you ecstatic

If you're thinking of ""why bother getting this game when Slay the Spire 2 is going to come out soon?"", well this is already one of the best games of all time, don't be silly."

+ Unique mechanics for each class
+ Fresh Final Stage
+ Although the theme is a bit light, at times the game dialogues were fun to watch

- A bit on the easy side
- AI not always finding the optimal move
- Not all enemies feel unique | Amazing roguelike with addicting gameplay and outstanding soundtrack.
The lucky factor can be a little anoying sometimes, but it's a dice game, so nothing wrong with it.
The gold lies on the challenges, and replaying levels when you fail does not feel bad, but engaging.
Love it. | fun little dicey game and i like the funny clown man | Incredibly fun dice-based rouge-lite.  A lot of variation in how to build each character.  Gameplay is very unique, never really played another game like it.  Love the humor in the game and soundtrack slaps. | A fun game with an abundance of challenges. Despite the main premise of the game, the player is provided with a handful of tools to turn the odds into their favour. There are a variety of builds for all characters, and even weaker ones can get the job done. This of course requires the player to be able to adapt and play out their turns effectively, since despite everything mentioned above, the game is fairly challenging."
76561197970569635,556820,Warbands: Bushido,0.06666666666666667,"Free To Play, Indie, Strategy",0,"I actually really like this game. It looks beautiful, the aesthetic is very well presented in every little detail. The gameplay is easy to understand and easy to master yet satisfying when you win. Not a huge time commitment for each round, but plenty of content to dive into if you so desire.

so what's the problem?

It's a port of a mobile game that has the bait/in game purchases removed but the adjustment that has been made to the reward system is insufficient. So in a game that's designed to have parts that can not be beaten until you attain better units, goading you into a purchase. You are stuck and forced to grind to obtain the ingame currency, which is very very limited unless you are able to win multiplayer matches, of which there are few because the game has so few players.


They have written in updates that the mobile versions have reduced drops, but i've played both and the grind is just as bad on the computer. Really rubs salt in the wound that you paid for a game on faith only to find out there's a free version. I'm not even going to ask for a refund i'm going to leave this review up to let people know to not waste their money.

I hope the devs see this and consider a rebalance of currency, or perhaps a larger assortment of units and cards upon purchase, more frequent drops of rewards. 
I would buy a dozen copies of this game for my friends, but I don't want them to be stuck after the first campaign like I am.  Whatever, it needs something to make the game progress feel like actual progress. | I paid for this game in Early Access and then it became free to play. Now I have to login everyday and wait until I have enough gold to unlock things that I previously paid for to be unlocked. Never buy anything from these developers. Save your money. Do not reward people who do this with your money. | Avis donné après 54h de jeu:

TL;DR:
- Très bien si vous aimez les wargames escarmouches
- Très bien si vous aimez réfléchir à l'optimisation
- Très bien si contrairement aux boulets vous lisez les règles
- Très bon rapport qualité prix
[Edit après plusieurs MAJ]
- Attention à ceux qui jouent LENTEMENT. Qui prennent une vie pour choisir un déplacement, une vie pour une carte. Oui, y en a pas mal alors prenez de quoi lire.
- Il y a des escarmouches où les dés sont contre vous. Vous avez beau prendre en tenaille, avoir plus de dés et jouer des cartes spéciales, l'ennemi remporte les assauts. Oui, c'est très improbable mais pas impossible. Et bien des fois votre réacteur à improbabilité s'emballe et vous passez une partie à subir misérablement une stratégie adverse nulle, mais bénie par Benten de bout en bout.


J'adore les wargames. J'ai joué plein de batailles dans mon salon ou dans mon garage, parfois des week end entiers. C'est un ami qui m'a parlé de ce jeu, et j'ai voulu essayer. 6€ ça me semblait pas très cher. Et ça les vaut largement.

J'ai lu des avis de rageux qui ne comprennent pas les dés, ni les cartes, ni la raison de la perte de dés. C'est sûr que s'ils n'ont pas lu les règles (RTFM!!! ou LCPDM en français) ils ne vont rien comprendre du tout et passer à côté du jeu. Donc n'écoutez pas ces avis idiots.

J'ai aimé ce jeu car il est assez exigeant dans la tactique et la stratégie. 
- Tactique car il faut bien choisir ses placements (si je mets mon personnage là, son samouraï devra soit le charger, soit le contourner, ce qui me laissera le temps de redéployer mon archer derrière cette palissade, par exemple.), bien choisir le moment de jouer une carte (si j'attends ce lancé de dé, je pourrais accumuler assez d'honneur pour combiner ces deux cartes, par exemple), bien choisir sa cible (si je focus ce plus faible, je pourrai prendre en tenaille le plus fort et lui faire perdre des dés et du déplacement) etc.
- Stratégique car il faut bien choisir son équipe. J'ai croisé des équipes que de tireurs, ou que de trois gros lourds; bref des équipes dont les personnages s'articulaient mal entre eux, qui ne faisaient pas synergie. De même il n'y a pas de cartes miracles. Dans mon deck j'ai peu de grosses cartes, mais j'ai des combinaisons de petites cartes et ça passe très bien. 

Enfin j'ai aimé car je n'ai rien dépensé une fois le jeu acheté. J'ai fini la campagne, j'ai plus de personnages ""doré"" que j'ai de place dans mes équipes, j'ai toutes les cartes en double exemplaire. Je ""détruits"" mes cartes en trop et mes figurines pas assez rares pour récupérer des poussières et fabriquer ce dont j'ai envie ou besoin. 

Y a que du multi et pas assez de solo, c'est vrai. Mais le temps de trouver une partie j'ai le temps de lire un webcomic. Les parties ne sont pas très rapide. J'ai pas chronométré mais ça doit faire dans les 5 à 10minutes. Mais si on aime les batailles c'est très bien. | I think this game is great except for a couple of things that I feel might make other players not even bother. 

1. Your units don't gain honor (xp) in the single player campaign. I don't really mind playing the multiplayer except that the Arena (which is a second multiplayer mode) doesn't seem to have anyone playing it and after playing 150 hard-earned coins for access I just sit waiting for a player. This also means that the arena quests are mostly worthless as there doesn't seem to be anyone playing. Again, all this would be a non-issue if I could just level up my units in the single player campaigns which are fun (if short) 

2. I don't mind grinding the single player campaigns to get coins through quests/achievements but you only get three quests at a time. One is a regular multiplayer quest (like kill 10 enemies in multiplayer), the second is an arena quest that after the initial one, you will never complete. The third is a single-player quest but there's a catch. The quests require you to complete the same campaign in all the difficulty levels before you get quests for the other two campaigns. When you get the ""Complete Cutthroats Campaign at Insane difficulty"" you will need to have leveled up your units to max level to even have a chance of completing that quest. Since Arena is dead and the single player requires leveled units to complete the quest, you're stuck grinding the regular multiplayer for hours and hours. This gets especially tedious once you've completed 50% or so of the acheivements (which also give coins) 

Since the arena multiplayer community is pretty much dead, this ends up being a great game that you can't really get all the best from. If the devs would enable leveling in single-player and perhaps add more quests then this game would be on my all-time top 10 pc games. Even then, the single player is so fun that I'd easily put it in the top 20. | THIS GAME HAS NO MEANINGFUL PVE - just need to get that out the way, to avoid any disappointment.
The core of the game is collecting & levelling troops, and PvE doesn't contribute to either (negligible loot & no XP) - in fact, aside from the tutorial, you really shouldn't even attempt PvE until you have PvP'd yourself some stronger troops.

** Pros **
Really interesting videogame concept, well executed with a very nice price point.
The game is heavily random (as dice based), but there's nonetheless plenty to do strategically.
The PvP seems to be very pick-up-and-play; you don't have to socialize and there's no chat.

** Cons **
Seeing as how quick PvP skirmishes form the bulk of gameplay, it gets pretty repetitive for a game that needs to be played a lot to make progress.
While well presented, afraid I just found the setting & units very bland and hard to distinguish; there's no fantastical units (e.g. sorcerers or oni), no ninjas, or even simply unique characters - nor is there any world-building of note.

In conclusion: excellent value 'hobby game' if you are in the market & don't want the temptation of microtransactions, but don't expect memorable PvE or story-telling - really hope that the developers plan expansions, or to use this engine/model for miniature games in livelier settings."
