76561198061669144,1,Knights in Tight Spaces Demo,"Action, Adventure, Strategy",Recommended,"The nicely-sketched hand-drawn visuals of Knights in Tight Spaces have a good D&D, medieval-fantasy look & feel : ) Medieval choir vocals feel medieval, too, but the signature drum-machine snare and trap-set leftover here from Fights in Tight Spaces feels, well, out of place in a fantasy setting. That movie ""A Knight's Tale"" was kind of overwhelmed by its rock n' roll soundtrack, although it worked well in the Highlander movie, idk. Maybe they'll remove the heavy beats rhythm section after Early Access. Sharing cards worked in Fights, but is nonsense in the character classes of Knights: you equip a cloak on your rogue, and your uncloaked brawler can sneak with it? Nonsense. Make it a solo-adventure, or make each character have their own deck, but not one giant, mixed-up deck. Everyone in the reviews talking about bloated, unfocused decks are right. Support attack needs to include stats like range. There are several things like this that need to be cleaned up: For example, card stats are at the top of the cards, and that's good, but still some card stats are below the bottom of the screen, and not visible, and that's bad. Oh, and tutorial has some blue text in dark grey text boxes, and that's hard to read. But overall, this Banner-Saga-like, Wartales-esque,  battle chess core game mechanics is really cool! (and distinct and different enough from those other similar games that I want to play this one!) It's still in Early Access. Hopefully, they will make these changes, and then it will be an awesome tactical puzzle and deckbuilder!",4.3 hrs on record																					(1.5 hrs at review time),N/A

Got it because the German Climate Action funded it! Disappointed it was just another arms race, the same kind of familiar arms race that has brought us to the brink of climate disaster. Playing Spirit Island, Beecarbonize, and Mystic Vale instead. Maybe RPG is just the wrong genre for a climate action game. Maybe that's why we were destined to be in this climate predicament, you know? because in real life everyone's sort of rpg gaming and questing it up! and it's wrecking, depleting and exhausting the planet. Even if you join the celtic faction against the roman faction, Drova is still that familiar arms race that ends up in nuclear weapons, climate disaster and a.i. --- too deep and heavy, i know, just sharing what I was looking for, and why I was disappointed.

76561198061669144,1,Predynastic Egypt,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"I was surprised by this efficiency puzzle 4X (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate). It's true what they say: the best solo games are efficiency puzzles. A mellowing 50-something artistic realist, I enjoy this sensory experience: it's a pleasant blend of sights and sounds; audio is animal and rain sounds and village life, and visuals are stylized Egyptian art and hieroglyphics. Nothing alarming, stressful or violent. Entertaining history lesson for a lazy Sunday afternoon. The theme of Egyptian mythology reminds me of Spirit Island, King of Dragon Pass, Against the Storm and Terra Mystica. Religion plays an important part in the fate of your tribe, as it has throughout history. Worker-placement mechanics are kept fresh by a changing map as you scout and build, trade and raid. As it says, ""bold plans and fierce might"" are indeed needed to actually achieve the ever-expanding goals to victory. My first game I was having fun ""treading water"" and the game allows you to do that, before announcing finally that I had lost and was as ""wise as a baby!"" So of course I had to play again, and was itching to pass one of the 7 or 8 trials this time, which I finally did, but it was a challenge! I had to pay more attention, actually learn some of the history and religion, and then prioritize accordingly. It's light strategy, not deep, but still good ""work for brain"", and mine needs work, that's for sure. It took me about 7 hours to play through Predynastic Egypt. It was engaging the whole time!

Wartales is just a better EXPERIENCE than all of them. Wartales has better music than all of them, except possibly Banner Saga. Wartales has better art and ""look & feel"" than all of them, except Wartile. Wartales has better core gameplay than all of them, except possibly Battle Brothers. Wartales has more gritty realism, less magic than all of them, except Wartile and Expeditions. Wartales doesn't have a metascore (yet?), but I would rate it around 90, higher than all of them.

Addictive, in a bad way: I still play, even though the game has problems. I can't NOT play. Just taking money from the lands starts to bother this Earthmonk elf, but the variety of real-world maps are a huge plus, and the other players are above-average thoughtful, in my experience. It's a great game to make friends from all over the world, because it's UI is language-independent mostly. Just turn off the AI music playing wrong notes. And just play one game at a time: 4 of my multiplayer games were just deleted when devs released an update. Devs are British guys based in Beijing, China. Opening and closing the game frequently freezes my steam, and I have to restart my computer to clear it. Overall, LOOKS appealing, but there are fatal flaws, maybe with my computer though, idk. I like Ozymandias, and it ENTHRALLED me for a time, but in the final analysis, I can give it only a 8 out of 10. It needs an ecological aspect about climate change.

76561198061669144,4,Dune: Spice Wars,Strategy,Recommended,"True to Frank Herbert's DUNE! It's a 4X wargame with a political dimension: there is the 4th X, the extermination ""domination"" victory, but there is also a political victory and a general hegemony victory and an economic victory. (Hegemony is a complex mix of the various factors of your control over the desert planet: social, political, military, economic, espionage (hard power, soft power).) Very subtle and nuanced for this genre. Ballet indeed. A masterwork! DUNE fans will love it! There are the visceral and beautifully ""Lawrence of Arabia"" poetic visual experiences like seeing your Fremen riding the giant Shai Hulud worm fleeing a raging sandstorm under the moons of Arrakis on a cool desert nightscape. And there are the administrative details of what to build and how to manage the resources of your villages, but DUNE is a sci-fi fantasy version of ""The Great Game"" Afghanistan (the hundred year geostrategic contest between Britain and Russia for control of Eurasia in the 19th century. The arena for the Great Game was all the lands, kingdoms and nations between the two Empires.) Play it at the speed it was designed to be played at, not the adrenaline-junky 1.5X ""very fast"", and you will have the full ""Lawrence of Arabia"" experience, as it was designed to be enjoyed. Its slower default speed is for fans of the books and new movie to savor the theme, the cinematography, the intrigue and shifting allegiances, the subtle nuances of DUNE the Great Game as it was designed to be experienced.

(Visuals are hand-painted works of art, and the music is Celtic drum and lady, which enhances the experience of that historical time, place, and cultural mythology.) The tone is serious, but not dark; it's engaging, but not depressing. Nice balance. Also it's a good balance of deckbuilding, tactics, and character development. It's physical and gritty, but the violence is implied, so no blood and gore, which is a classy touch that's a relief really, as it makes it more pallettable on repeat play-throughs, and doesn't distract from the tactical and strategic decision-making that is the game actually. (Also it's animals, not people, so that's healthier ""programming"" for the brain and body, you know (less adrenaline while sitting still and unable to purge it from the body through physical activity). The light story-generating, door-choosing mechanic reminded me of Fate Hunter, but this is better. It has Fate Hunter's and Mage Knight's card-play mechanic, too, but again, this is better. You will also recognize Banner Saga's character-leveling mechanic. It has the bleed and poison mechanic from Darkest Dungeon, but without the horror and mental illness, so again this is a healthier experience. Oh, and the tactics are close to Nowhere Prophet, with fighters positioned on a couple few rows of spaces, but this is better because there are no trees that you move during combat, or any other unrealistic things.

If you liked Judgement Apocalypse or RimWorld, but wished the tactics were 3D, then you'll love Going Medieval! I like the day & night cycles, the weather, the birdsong, and the intermittent medieval music, too; it really makes me feel like I'm there, building in a medieval forest. I watched ""How to Build a Castle"" on Curiosity Stream just before playing Going Medieval, and I can tell you this game is historically accurate. All the materials and natural resources are exactly what they used to build back then! The raids add a sense of purpose and urgency, but are optional, which is a nice touch; it's a building game, not a wargame. There's no mandatory fight grinding like in Judgement Apocalypse. As I build my castle, I get more influence among neighboring towns, which are friend and foe. Graphs show total value as I build, similar to Microsoft's Age of Empire graphs. My starting three settlers have already been joined by two more. We've cut down a lot of trees already. I'll feel better once I figure out how to plant trees! Unlike Judgement Apocalypse, work is assigned by prioritizing tasks like in RimWorld, with an option to directly control settlers during raids. This is the best of both, I think. There's no option to go first-person point-of-view to a settler like in Life is Feudal: Forest Village, but I don't miss it. If I want FPS, I'll play an FPS game; this is a building game. I like taking care of my people, like in This War of Mine and Frostpunk, and Going Medieval rewards you for caring about the mood and health of your people, which I love. Going Medieval is my new go-to game instead of Banished, RimWorld, Judgement Apocalypse, or Life is Feudal: Forest Village.

76561198061669144,5,Nowhere Prophet,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"Nowhere Prophet is my favorite game on Steam. I was designing an adventure optimization deck-building tactical-puzzle game I'd love: a thinking artist's hybrid of my favorites (Banner Saga, This War of Mine, Mini Metro, Niche, Neoscavenger, UnReal World, Slay the Spire, Darkest Dungeon and Battle Brothers when I can stand the gore), but I stopped, because Nowhere Prophet is that game, and without the animated violence. Its good writing paints a picture of accurate details that immerse you in a realistic journey through a plausible near-future scenario: drones, hydroponic farms, cult fanatics, slaves and seeds for sale in derelict spaceports. It's ""choose-your-own-adventure"" Mad Max meets The Walking Dead in India: techno-veena, monks chanting and the empty empty winds of a dusty wasteland ""deepen"" the mood and augment your concentration. And concentrate you must. (but ""lightly"" in a dispassionate and discerning way --- vairagya + viveka = va-va-VANQuishing those who would prey upon you and your followers!) Contemplate, even meditate, upon making the most of what you have and what you find along the unknown road: keeping in mind that even in chaos, the spiritual law of karma reigns supreme: action & reaction, the results of your thoughts, words and deeds. Will you take sides in a stranger's squabble? Ambush the good samaritans who rescue you? Wander evasively, or lead your wounded nomads into danger? Free the slaves from the fighting pits, or buy them? Buy that shiny gadget for yourself, or food for your starving followers? The element of chance makes it addictively uncertain: I was hooked by the sweet agony of constant compromise and desperate adaptation in order to survive unlucky dilemnas (maybe). Yes, it's frustrating and discouraging at times, and you will feel like crying out: ""It's not fair!"" , but not to have this feeling would be unrealistic, wouldn't it? Because life isn't fair. BELIEVE, and LIVE! And prevailing is all the more sweeter, when you do beat the odds by min/max ""stacking the deck"" in your favor, literally. Even (or especially) in post-scarcity, decentralized collapse of civilization, it's hope, courage and purpose that part the troubled waters ahead. (That, and a well-timed head-shot.) The occasional note of teen fantasy in the art, music and writing isn't completely out of place amid the overall serious and reverent tone of treating serious struggles for survival seriously. It's also stimulating, entertaining and fun, however, and transports you far away from the mundane. (and aren't we all teenagers at heart anyway really?) Nowhere Prophet is infinitely replayable, as is chess: If your misguided choices bring doom upon you & your followers (and they will: this is no ""power-trip"" RPG), then dust off your reincarnated self, and get back on the wheel of samsara. Choose a little wiser, fight a little faster, travel a little farther the next go-'round. (More heart and soul, less killer instinct, perhaps? Target the murderous rabid sociopath raiding your camp, and pardon --- or recruit? --- his wildmen thralls --- the nuanced game mechanics reward merciful restraint,...and overwhelming force with specific goals, as in real life. While not glorifying violence, and actually rewarding minimal-carnage ""surgical"" strikes, as in real life.) Lead on! (This is a pilgrimage!) (full disclosure: my parents were musicians and painters in California: they raised me a Hindu chess club nerd, and I was a monk under vows in a Hindu monastery for 2 years after high school.

76561198013735074,1,Kainga: Seeds of Civilization,"Indie, Strategy",Recommended,"Neighbours almost always are awful. RELEASE THE SNAILS! More seriously though: It is a very fun little game, despite its issues; - Your AI's pathing is dangerously bad; I've had my braves (workers) or even my thinker (leader) decide to walk right through enemies instead of any smart path around them, which has ended the game pretty much immediately on occasion - Of the 4 maps I've got access to so far, I absolutely hate one of them, love another, and the other two are heavily dependant on what relatively random tech I get. - While none of the challenges are impossible persay, some may as well be if you get a bad combination of tech and situations - The neighbours are, seriously, a problem more often than not; they start extremely comparatively advanced, and they tend to be hostile from the start (despite being listed as ""cautious"", but ""cautious"" goes pretty far into the negatives from my observation) In its current state, it's highly frustrating and I recommend it mostly if you can get it on sale. But it does have a lot of potential, and managing to win a challenge is extremely satisfying. Did I mention that the braves are idiots? I just lost a game due to having two of them walk under the feet of a beast that squished them, and the other two drowned themselves while trying to get onto a fishing post... I don't even know how they managed that... But despite its issues, I do highly enjoy it hence I still recommend it - just be prepared to start a new run at the drop of a brave, no matter how well it was going previously. Bright side, your runs aren't in vain - in addition to whatever you personally learn, there's also certain things you can do (taming beasts, befriending or eliminating other Thinkers, etc) that give you knowledge scrolls that can be used both in the run as well as outside of it - so a failed run can still help you progress your overall advancement and make the next run have a chance to be a little better.",109.9 hrs on record																					(63.5 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198013735074,1,dotAGE,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"If you enjoy the challenge of a really punishing community builder with more RNG than strategy, then you'll be playing this one again and again! Don't get me wrong, I am that type enough that I'm pushing through to collect the achievements. But there is SO much to this game that's just... counter-intuitive to fun gameplay. You unlock more options as you go, and it's rather nice that this happens whether you win or lose an event that you can try to influence (with more for winning them, of course). Except having more options isn't necessarily a good thing. Why? Because your research options are entirely randomized each run, as is the map, and the two are NOT linked. For example, your random vegetable might be Tomato, which gets a bonus from being next to a water producer, while getting the type of water producer that has to be built on Stony terrain, and a map where you have little to no usable terrain - so no optimized veggies; which wouldn't be so bad, except they're not just for eating as other things such as one of your Doom protection methods might also need them. And despite having unlocked so many options, you will have no access to the ones that didn't get randomly rolled for a given playthrough. Oh, and some of the things you unlock on the way are pretty much entirely negative, but you have to unlock them to get to the more positive ones beyond them. You can only protect against about half of the bad events, but the ones you can't protect against can absolutely devastate your village and make it increasingly unlikely if not impossible to then win the ones you can influence. Think the answer is to just have more people to have more workers dedicated to that defense? Well, here's hoping you can then ALSO overcome the increasingly punishing overpopulation penalty! The Elders that you choose from each have unique aspects, but be prepared to have to learn to work around entirely new issues while no longer having access to some of the ways you might be expecting to solve those problems normally. I believe higher difficulties might give you more points towards the progression for unlocking things, but I've honestly not found any reason to be inclined to play on anything higher than the easiest difficulty; the way it amps up in the punishment isn't worth the minorly increased reward, especially since it won't take that long to unlock stuff, and, again... unlocking more stuff isn't usually a good thing. This game had a lot of potential to be a great masterpiece in its genre. It just took every choice along the way that detracts from that by adding more punishment rather than more options. There's a distinct difference between ""Challenging"" and ""Punishing"" that was missed along the way here. If you catch it on sale and are a bit of a masochist, go for it! -Update- So, while I still largely don't agree with many of the mechanics or choices for the direction of the game, I can't deny that the developer does clearly care about the vision and future of it, and does interact with the community. If you're okay with the harsher aspects of it, you'll probably get your money's worth from it. Even if it's not, there is the thing that's kept me playing - the Achievements are doable, but just challenging enough (and RNG dependent in a few cases) that they take time and effort to get, and actually feel like little medals of honour for finally getting them, lol.","1,094.9 hrs on record																					(946.2 hrs at review time)",N/A

Oh, and you eventually become ""Well Fed"" meaning you can't consume anymore - which includes potions, not just food. -You have a carrying capacity that seems exceptionally low. Maybe there's a random trait that increases that or other means I didn't find yet. -You're randomized, save for your name, appearance (from within small set of options), and your ""backstory"". You get a few rerolls to change your starting gear and traits - which I didn't notice was limited at the time of creation (my mistake, but it didn't feel terribly obvious until I was looking for it). -Stamina limitations; your max and recovery are too low, and it's too easy to end up increasing your cost (if you're carrying a heavy load - which with the carry capaicty being so relatively low, is very easy to hit). I simply don't feel like I've accomplished anything by the time I'm forced to stop to wait. I agree with the sentiments that it feels like a browser game, or maybe a very pretty mobile game. If it were one of those, I'd probably feel more inclined. As a Steam game, I'm uninstalling it in favour of something that feels more rewarding for the time spent.
