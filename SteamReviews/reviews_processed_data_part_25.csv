76561198040729539,1,N/A,Recommended,"I just can't recommend in its current form. With this type of game, I'm used to to grind and resets.But, when I'm actively playing for 2 hours or coming back to it after 8, and there's no real progress, there's a problem. Chest costs are incremental, and you're at the mercy of RNG on whether you unlock a card or not. Upgrading a card re-locks the cards again (unless you pay premium), leaving you with the RNG again, assuming you can even afford to open the chest again. Guild system is confusing. You're just never sure which one you should use at a time. Heroes level so slowly, they're all but useless. Maybe the game get more interesting later with more unlocks. But it takes so long to get there, it's hard to care enough to find out.",6.6 hrs on record,N/A
76561198040729539,1,N/A,Recommended,"If you can get this on sale for less than $5 (as I did), go for it. But I can't really call this worth $15. I finished the campaign in ~5 hours. At first, it was difficult, but once I realized half the units were just a waste to resources, I got through it rather fast. The end makes it sound like more is coming, but the dev said he is done with it. I have no personal interest in online multiplayer and it seems to be added just to flesh the game out because of the abysmally short campaign. Plus, multiplayer is d-e-a-d. It is not necessarily a bad game, but it does not justify it's base price.",8.0 hrs on record																					(5.1 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198040729539,1,N/A,Recommended,"Music is pretty good. Unfortunately, that's all the good things I have to say about this. - Cutscenes are just mid-quality pictures - Voice acting is meh - Combat is slow - Pilot exclamations during combat gets irritating fast It felt petty to request my 50 cents back, but I was just not having any fun with it.",0.6 hrs on record,N/A
