Hala oynanabilirliğini koruyor. | Uma verdadeira joia para quem gosta de um jogo mais técnico. Os combates podem ser bem intensos e frenéticos, mas são muito divertidos, e o game consegue entregar algo que não consigo receber de nenhum outro FPS.

A física do game e a mecânica da gravity gun abrem diversas possibilidades, como transformar objetos aleatórios em armas ou escudos e até repelir granadas, bolas de energia e outros props que forem lançados em sua direção. 

A movimentação é um show à parte: Se você dominar as técnicas de bunnyhopping e strafe, você vai sentir como se estivesse voando pelo mapa. Bunnyhopping é uma arte nesse game.

É uma pena que este game não tenha a devida atenção da Valve. | Although not as updated and great as any other deathmatch game, Half Life 2: Deathmatch Still Has Some Fun And Variety Throughout This Game, Despite How Old, And Dead, that the game is, it still captivates thousands of people to play with its awesome action packed gameplay, its like a gmod sandbox server after you break a random crate (chaos,) especially with the gravity gun, the gravity gun is fun for killing players like said in the HL2 20th anniversary update, someone in the documentary spoke abt how the gravity gun was fun because you could hurl a toilet at someones face and it would come up with the toilet icon on the kill cam thing,
basically, what im saying is ""PLAY HALF LIFE 2: DEATHMATCH NOW, AND ALSO VALVE PLEASE UPDATE THE GAME, THIS GAMES LAST UPDATE COUNT IS LONGER THEN HOW LONG THE DINASOURS HAVE BEEN EXTINCT"" | Half-Life 2 Death match  is a very good first person shooter game. Fans of Half-Life 2, Team Fortress 2 and other first person shooter games should enjoy Half-Life 2 Death match | Just a game, which, in any decade, you can launch, and launch toilets in enemies.

76561197999259031,6980,Thief: Deadly Shadows,3.9833333333333334,Action,0,"Ну как и с предыдущими двумя частями для начала прям вот железно необходимо установить мод(TFIX), чтобы игра работала гладко на современных компутерах. В третьей части уже видны отголоски более менее сносной графики и более менее отзывчивого управления, и механики игры.

Сюжет интригует, а его подача тонкая и хорошо продуманная, не вмешиваясь в геймплей, а дополняя его. Атмосфера, достигнутая в этой игре, невероятна, и лишь немногие игры с тех пор могут сравниться с ней, несмотря конечно на всякие новые технологии и прочее. Говоря об атмосфере, одна миссия всегда приходит на ум любому, кто когда-либо играл в эту часть и каждый поймет, о какой из них я говорю.

В игре есть моменты, которые тревожны, таинственны и интенсивны, а иногда представляют собой прекрасный коктейль из этих трех слов. Иногда она создает атмосферу ужаса лучше, чем любая игра ужасов. Я в значительной степени отношу это к подходу к дизайну, который был в предыдущих частей серии. Не зная, куда идешь или что можешь найти, когда попадаешь туда. Или, что еще хуже, думая, что знаешь, во что ввязываешься, и постепенно осознавая, что все не так, как кажется на первый взгляд. Рассказывание историй через дизайн уровней, а не через кат-сцены, сейчас редко где такое увидишь, и здесь представлен прекрасный пример этого.

Что хочется сказать в конце? Сначала рекомендую сыграть в первые две части, чтобы привыкнуть ко всем механикам игры и ее проблемам с которыми можно соткнуться и в моменте вы полностью погрузитесь в странный, темный мир, в котором живет Гарретт.
8/10 | Wow this game is a mess.

That's not to say there's nothing good about it, but the bad far outweighs what things it does do right. As for the things I liked about it, I thought some of the levels were decent. The Moira mansion and the museum were good, but the rest of the levels were a mixed bag for one reason or another. I liked the Cradle for the first half of the mission but it started getting stale when you had to keep backtracking. I thought the story was actually pretty decent. The Hag was an interesting concept and the game did a good job slowly revealing her plan. Her reveal was disappointing though and was made worse by the final mission of the game. Other than that, I really don't have anything positive to say about this game.

First and foremost, every single thing in this game is insanely janky. The movement is torturous. It feels unresponsive and so awkward, like Garrett just woke up from a coma and he's learning how to walk again. Constantly getting stuck on the floors with even the slightest bit of unevenness. The weapons feel so awful to use. The bow is by far the worst, where you have to wait for an awkward animation before you can actually line up a shot. Enemies have bizarre hitboxes that make using the blackjack very frustrating at times. Enemies getting stuck in the floor after you blackjack them. Guards getting stabbed by their own sword after you blackjack them. I could go on.

There's also a general oversimplification of gameplay. Moss arrows are essentially useless now that tile/metal floors don't make more noise now. No more rope arrows now so verticality has been greatly minimized. The levels overall are very linear now with almost no secret passages or alternate routes. Basically every single enemy is humanoid now all with the same AI, meaning you never have to change your strategy to get through areas. There just wasn't enough variety to keep the game interesting.

I already mentioned it a bit but the levels were a massive downgrade from the previous games. Because they are much shorter and simpler, it makes it difficult for any of them to leave a lasting impression. For instance, Compare the Sunken Citadel to the Lost City from Thief 1, it's just not even close. The idea of the different districts in the city isn't necessarily a bad idea but again the linearity makes them really boring to go through. Combined with the incessant, respawning enemies and near constant backtracking and you end up just sprinting though to get to the next mission or loading zone. 

There's more I could complain about but this is already too long. It's unfortunate how this game turned out. It seems a major issue is the hardware limitations of the Xbox which this game was clearly designed for. But even ignoring the simplified levels and mechanics, the game is still a major disappointment. When I played Thief 2 I said that it didn't quite have the magic that Thief 1 did, but it was still good. This game has none of that magic and it's not good at all. | Great Taffer game! :D ""It is not an easy thing to see a Keeper, especially one who does not wish to be seen."" | The Thief franchise is often underestimated, with Thief: Deadly Shadows standing out as the finest installment in the series. I recommend experiencing all the games, as they each offer enjoyable gameplay. However, if you plan to play this title, it's essential to research how to ensure it runs smoothly on your computer. Many of these games, which are over two decades old, may encounter compatibility issues with modern systems.

In this game, you assume the role of Garrett, the master thief. Elusive and never apprehended, Garrett is unparalleled in his craft. He can evade any guard, unlock any door, and infiltrate the most securely protected homes. Operating in the dark and treacherous City, he steals from the affluent to enrich himself, navigating a world rife with crime and corruption, where the wealthy exploit the less fortunate, and magic and machinery exist in a delicate balance. Garrett is a weary and cynical character, embodying the essence of the original Thief trilogy.

This installment distinguishes itself from its predecessors primarily through the use of a more advanced engine, which enhances lighting and shadow effects. Visually, it surpasses earlier titles, but as always, where there is light, shadows follow. The gameplay is generally satisfactory, though I occasionally experienced issues with ""floating,"" which occurs when jumping frequently causes physics glitches. While these can be resolved in-game, they remain a minor annoyance. Additionally, I noticed a few areas where the level designers seemed inexperienced with the new engine, resulting in missing textures or glitchy geometry. However, most players are likely to overlook these imperfections.

From a gameplay perspective, it is evident that this game was designed with consoles in mind, reflecting the classic console era of the 2000s. While it remains playable with a keyboard and mouse, those accustomed to the earlier titles may need some time to adjust. On the positive side, mechanics such as sneaking and stealthily approaching enemies have been improved. A significant change from previous games is the semi-open world design, which offers a bit more freedom of exploration. | The Thief franchise is sorely overlooked. Thief: Deadly Shadows is the best entry in the entire series. Play them all, they are all a good time. It's important to note, if you want to play this game. go online and see what you need to do to make it work on your computer. Some of these games that are 20+ years old have issues running on today's systems."
76561197999259031,220,Half-Life 2,0.05,Action,0,"A monumental game in my gaming career, Half-Life 2 was that defining experience that made me realise I was in for something next level. For the first time i picked it up on The Orange Box in 2008, and from the moment I booted it up, I knew I was in for a wild ride. It wasn’t just a game—it was an event. The environments were absolutely massive, the atmosphere was unreal, and the soundtrack? Edgy as hell. Every moment felt like a cinematic journey.

In Half-Life 2, you play as Gordon Freeman, arguably one of the most reluctant action heroes in gaming. You awaken from stasis, burdened with the trauma of the previous game, and are immediately thrust into action as the figurehead of an uprising. This isn’t a simple revolution—it’s a battle against a multiversal alien threat, shrouded in dystopian themes and orchestrated by secretive organizations manipulating events behind the scenes.

Set in a world dominated by the Combine, an alien regime that combines interdimensional authoritarianism with advanced technology, you must navigate a planet under their control. Armed with little more than a crowbar and your signature nonverbalism, Gordon becomes the key figure in the resistance. As you progress, you'll engage in intense combat, solve puzzles, explore diverse environments, and uncover the unsettling truth that nothing in this world is as it seems.

And let’s talk about The G-Man—a mysterious, interdimensional CIA glowman who pops up like a bad dream and probably controls the entire charade like a cosmic puppeteer. Is he good? Is he bad? Is he just playing the long game? Who knows, but he’s definitely got his hand in everything, watching Gordon like a hawk, pulling strings like an invisible god. 

You’d think it’s just a sci-fi conspiracy, but after a while, you start questioning if anyone really knows what the hell is going on. Does G-Man even have a purpose, or is he just a cosmic observer who gets his kicks out of watching a man with a crowbar take on the end of the world?

The game’s narrative feels like a giant puzzle, and each step forward opens up even more questions, all while you’re tearing through enemy lines, trying to get answers. And the best part? It’s not all about combat—there are puzzles to solve, mysteries to uncover, and a sense of isolation that keeps you on edge, constantly wondering who or what will show up next. The pacing is incredible, making you feel like you’re a tiny piece of something far larger, with consequences that span across dimensions.

Now when the episodes are combines (haha) The user experience is smooth and now it is even moddable! 5/5 | 之前20周年更新开发者评论模式后我又打了一遍，阀是怎样做到的，让我反复爱上它们的游戏。在游戏里跟开发者评论一起探索是我最喜欢的事，我喜欢看游戏开发历程和小故事，实在是让人大开眼界。
为什么这个滑梯不能上去，这个跷跷板是可以玩的，原来这里也有小巧思，这里的电线是视觉引导物，怎样保持一个休闲和紧张的平衡，能在游戏里亲自上手跟看GDC或者工具箱是完全不一样的体验，我会贪婪地希望每一个我喜欢的游戏都添加开发者评论。 | ""Half-Life 2"" is one of the most influential and groundbreaking first-person shooters ever made. Released in 2004 by Valve, it redefined what players could expect from a video game in terms of both storytelling and gameplay. The game’s narrative is immersive, unfolding without traditional cutscenes, which allows the player to feel like they are truly part of the story. The protagonist, Gordon Freeman, is a silent hero who navigates through a dystopian world filled with alien invaders and oppressive human forces. This unique approach to storytelling pulls the player into the game’s world, making every action feel meaningful.

The physics engine in ""Half-Life 2"" was revolutionary for its time. The way objects interact with the environment feels natural and intuitive, and it became a major part of the gameplay. From solving puzzles using physics to creatively using the environment as a weapon, it was an innovation that influenced many games that followed. The gravity gun, which allows players to manipulate objects in real-time, is still one of the most memorable and fun weapons in gaming history.

The level design in ""Half-Life 2"" is another standout feature. The game introduces players to varied environments, from the dark, industrial city of City 17 to the eerie, remote marshlands. Each location feels carefully crafted, with attention to detail that makes the world feel alive. The pacing is also masterful, alternating between moments of intense combat and slower, atmospheric sequences that allow the player to soak in the environment and story.

The AI in ""Half-Life 2"" was also ahead of its time. Enemies behave intelligently, using cover, working together, and reacting to the player’s actions in a way that makes combat more dynamic and challenging. The enemy variety, from the terrifying Combine soldiers to the creepy headcrabs, keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging. The interactions with NPCs and the world around you help build a sense of tension and immersion, keeping you on edge throughout the experience.

The game's soundtrack, composed by Kelly Bailey, perfectly complements the atmosphere, using subtle but effective music to enhance both the action and the quieter moments. The sound design is top-notch, with ambient sounds adding to the immersion, whether you're in a busy city street or exploring a deserted warehouse.

Ultimately, ""Half-Life 2"" is a masterpiece that still holds up to this day. Its innovative gameplay, storytelling, and technical achievements make it a game that set a new standard for the industry. It’s a game that’s not just fun to play, but one that’s easy to appreciate for the way it shaped the future of video games. Even though it’s been years since its release, ""Half-Life 2"" remains a classic that continues to inspire both players and developers alike.

 | I never get tired of this game. Half-Life mods are fun too. | game is fire but whoever designed the puzzles and the vehicle section i hope you never work in games again. also barney thick as hell"

Half-Life: Deathmatch: Source is a multiplayer first-person shooter developed by Valve. It is a remake of the classic Half-Life deathmatch mode, utilizing the Source engine. The game combines the fast-paced action of traditional deathmatch with updated graphics and more fluid movement mechanics. While it successfully brings new life to the original concept, some mechanical issues and a niche player base prevent it from being as popular as its predecessors.

What Works Well?
🎮 Classic Deathmatch Gameplay
The core of Half-Life: Deathmatch is its tight, fast-paced combat. It stays true to the original deathmatch mode, offering classic weapons, high-speed action, and simple, enjoyable mechanics. The formula remains as fun today as it was when first introduced.

🌆 Updated Graphics with Source Engine
The move to the Source engine has significantly improved the visuals compared to the original. The lighting, textures, and models are much sharper, breathing new life into the iconic Half-Life universe. The environments feel more immersive, and physics interactions are more dynamic.

🔫 Familiar Weapon Set
Players have access to a variety of classic weapons from the Half-Life series, including the crowbar, shotgun, and crossbow, all of which perform as expected. Each weapon has its own strategic value, and they all function well within the confines of the deathmatch setting.

🛠️ Modding Support and Custom Servers
As with other Source engine games, Deathmatch: Source allows for a robust modding community. Players can easily find custom servers and user-created content, from new maps to modified gameplay modes, keeping the experience fresh.

What Could Be Better?
❌ Limited Popularity and Player Base
Despite its solid foundation, Half-Life: Deathmatch: Source suffers from a relatively small player base. As newer games in the genre continue to dominate, it can be difficult to find active matches, especially in more niche servers.

❌ Physics Can Feel Clunky
While the Source engine improved many aspects of the game, some of the physics—especially in terms of movement—can feel a little awkward compared to modern shooters. The transition to 3D space feels a bit more restrictive than anticipated, particularly when compared to the fluidity of more modern games.

❌ No Significant Gameplay Innovation
While the updated graphics and better physics are great, Deathmatch: Source doesn't introduce any major changes to the original formula. It feels more like a polished port rather than a revolutionary step forward for the genre. Players expecting something drastically new may be disappointed.

❌ Lack of Meaningful Progression
Like many classic deathmatch games, there’s a lack of meaningful progression or any form of unlockable content. While this keeps the focus on pure skill-based play, some players may miss the more modern systems that reward long-term engagement.

Conclusion
Half-Life: Deathmatch: Source is a solid multiplayer shooter for fans of the classic Half-Life experience. Its updated visuals and iconic weapons deliver the fun, high-speed action that fans love, but its small player base and lack of major innovation hold it back from achieving greater popularity. If you’re looking for nostalgic deathmatch action or enjoy modding, it’s a great choice, but don’t expect a revolutionary experience.

Rating: 7/10 – Fun for fans of classic shooters, but somewhat limited by its age and player base. 🎮💥 | It’s good and there are still servers if ur in europe buy it if ur not in eu you’ll probably have shit connection so don’t | 这老东西没人玩了，只能选人数不到两位数的服务器进去小玩一下。

- Но игра от этого хуже не становится ) | Итак, Left 4 dead, первая часть знаменитой дилогии игр, созданная Turtle Rock studios, под крылом Valve, в далеком 2008. 
Наиграв 47 часов в первой части и 368 часов во второй, хочется сказать, что эта игра однозначно прошла проверку временем и в неё всё ещё приятно возвращаться.
Кроме того, хочется отметить пугающую, вызывающую чувство страха и тревоги  атмосферу, которую, можно ощутить зайдя в главное меню игры. Это сочетание женского мычания протягивающего  ноты, придыхания, пианино, а так же звука рации на зов которой, кажется, больше никто не ответит, задаёт мрачный тон игре.
А выжившие, словно тлеющий уголёк среди пепла сгоревшего мира, из-за всех сил  пытаются  остаться в живых.
Как по мне сюжет не самая сильная сторона игры, да он есть, но звезд с неба не хватает, хотя проработка мира, мелких деталей , лора на высоком уровне. Отдельно хочется отметить проработку персонажей, их диалоги между собой, подколки, шутки, видно что была проведена большая работа над этим аспектом  игры, что сильно повлияло на погружение.

. A mulher usa armas de fogo, o grandalhão é o berserker e o magrelo é o mago.
. Na árvore de habilidades, existem 3 abas para cada um, sendo possível criar builds diferentes sempre que for jogar e também usar armas de outras classes, basta possuir os status necessários para empunhar a arma.
. No início escolhemos um pet, lobo ou lince. E ele ajuda muito durante o gameplay, porque tanka os inimigos, pode se transformar em monstros de acordo com o tipo de peixe que você o alimentar, equipa acessorios, sobe de level, usa magias, pega itens no chão pra você, vende seus itens na cidade retornando até você em menos de 2min e tem inventário para carregar itens.
. São 4 níveis de dificuldade escolhido no inicio e há um modo chamado HARDCORE onde ativa a morte permanente. Sim, se morrer já era.
. Na cidade você pega quests, conversa com NPCs, vende e compra itens, há 2 baús para guardar seus itens sendo que um serve para guardar itens compartilhando-os com seus outros chars criados. Mas char normal não compartilha itens com char hardcore.
. Gameplay é muito baseado em Diablo onde você vai nas dugeons, andar por andar explorando em visão aérea tipo no League of Legens, inclusive os gráficos lembram muito a versão antiga do LoL.

Eu achei muito viciante e desafiador no modo HARDCORE. Recomendo! Nota 9/10 | Awesome basic dungeon crawler. The RNG is super random, which sounds dumb, but you'll know what I mean if you start playing it. 

Awesome story, good themes and a nice chill experience! All in all, double thumbs-up 👍🏻👍🏻 | [h1] Cozy ARPG for fans of Diablo 1[/h1]
[h3] Should play well on almost all systems [/h3]

I love this game. I used to play it on my low spec netbook that struggled even running chrome, it ran this game well. There are a ton of better ARPGs out there, but none of them are as ""minimalist"" as this one. Single dungeon with multiple levels, basic classes and skills, small town with quest givers. It is a bare bones ARPG and that is not necessarily a bad thing. Not having to stress over synergies (non existent) complex skill trees (as basic as they come) makes this game perhaps the coziest ARPG out there. 

[b]Not recommended if you are looking for deep game mechanics, complex builds or modern quality of life improvements. [/b]

 | The game also comes with a DLC, which includes the following items:

1. A Toxic Community: Mistakes are rarely forgiven. Unless you’re playing with friends, be prepared to face harsh criticism, often from younger players. The game’s multiplayer is largely populated by school-aged players who don’t hold back.


2. Disruptive Adults: It’s not just the kids causing chaos—some adults blast music through their microphones, assuming everyone else shares their taste. Spoiler: they don’t.


3. Frequent AFKs: Teamwork can fall apart when a teammate goes inactive, whether they’re brewing tea, taking a smoke break, or simply wandering off mid-game. And yes, it often happens right after you’ve generously used your first aid kit on them.


4. Team Abandonment: Lone wolves running off to the far corners of the map, only to be overwhelmed by infected, are a common sight. They’re quick to flood the chat with colorful language before rage-quitting the game.


5. Difficulty Disputes: Some players join games on ""Expert"" difficulty only to demand a downgrade. If their request is denied, they might sabotage the team before leaving the server entirely.


6. Vote Kicks: Occasionally, you’ll encounter players who inexplicably start a vote to kick you from the game. When you ask why? Crickets.



The Verdict: Despite the chaotic community, Left 4 Dead 2 remains a phenomenal experience. The graphics are a significant step up from the first game, the mechanics feel more polished, and there’s a greater variety of weapons and infected to enjoy. However, surviving the online experience without a calming remedy might be just as challenging as surviving the zombie apocalypse itself. | Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D2), released by Valve in 2009, is the gold standard for cooperative zombie shooters. Featuring intense survival gameplay, smart AI, and an incredible atmosphere, L4D2 delivers an unmatched multiplayer experience. With its fast-paced action, diverse weapons, and unpredictable enemy encounters, this game remains one of the most thrilling and replayable co-op shooters ever made.

Gameplay – Pure, Adrenaline-Fueled Action
L4D2 is all about co-op survival. You and three teammates must fight through hordes of the undead, navigating through various maps and completing objectives to reach safety. The key to survival? Teamwork, strategy, and adaptability.

The gunplay is tight and satisfying, with a wide selection of weapons including assault rifles, shotguns, SMGs, sniper rifles, and melee weapons like axes, katanas, and even frying pans! Every encounter feels dynamic, thanks to the AI Director, which adjusts the difficulty based on your team’s performance, ensuring no two playthroughs are ever the same.

Special Infected – Enemies That Keep You on Edge
Beyond the standard zombie horde, L4D2 introduces Special Infected that force players to work together:

Tank – A massive brute that can throw debris and crush survivors.
Witch – A terrifying enemy that, if startled, can instantly incapacitate a survivor.
Smoker – Uses a long tongue to drag players away from their team.
Hunter – A fast, agile infected that pounces on survivors and pins them down.
Boomer – Explodes in a shower of bile, attracting a massive horde.
Charger – Charges through groups, slamming a survivor into the ground.
Spitter – Creates pools of acid that deal heavy damage.
Each Special Infected forces different team strategies, making communication and positioning absolutely crucial.

Campaigns & Maps – A Horror Movie Experience
L4D2 features multiple campaigns, each set in diverse, apocalyptic locations across the southern U.S.:

Dead Center – A chaotic mall escape reminiscent of classic zombie films.
The Parish – A tense race across New Orleans to reach an evacuation zone.
Swamp Fever – A creepy, foggy swamp filled with infected dangers.
Hard Rain – A unique campaign featuring a devastating hurricane that changes the environment.
Dark Carnival – A fan-favorite, featuring a deadly amusement park with a thrilling rollercoaster finale.
Each campaign feels like a mini zombie movie, packed with cinematic set pieces, interactive environments, and intense finales.

Multiplayer & Game Modes – Endless Replayability
L4D2 offers several game modes that keep the action fresh:

Campaign Mode – Classic co-op survival through story-driven levels.
Versus Mode – One team plays as survivors, while the other controls the Special Infected.
Survival Mode – See how long you can last against endless waves of zombies.
Scavenge Mode – A competitive mode where teams race to collect fuel cans while being hunted.
Mutation Mode – Weekly game modifiers that add fun twists to gameplay.
Thanks to modding support and the Steam Workshop, the community has also created hundreds of custom maps, weapons, and campaigns, making L4D2’s replayability practically infinite.

Graphics & Sound – Immersive and Timeless
Even years after release, L4D2’s atmospheric lighting, detailed environments, and gruesome effects hold up well. Zombies react realistically to gunfire, and the sound design is masterful, with eerie background noises, terrifying growls from Special Infected, and intense musical cues that heighten the suspense.

The voice acting and character interactions bring the survivors to life, making them memorable and adding humor to the chaos.

Why Left 4 Dead 2 is a Must-Play
L4D2 is the perfect blend of action, horror, and co-op gameplay. Whether you’re playing with friends or AI teammates, the intense combat, unpredictable enemy encounters, and endless replayability make every match a thrilling adventure.

🔹 Final Rating: 10/10
Left 4 Dead 2 is a masterpiece of cooperative gaming. If you love zombies, action, and teamwork, this is an absolute must-play that still delivers endless fun and excitement after more than a decade.





 | Simplesmente um jogo incrível
Como dizia Jack O Estripador, vamos por partes:
O jogo em sua base já é animal, os mapas foram todos feitos com muito carinho e esmero. 
Todas as campanhas originais são extremamente divertidas de jogar com amigos
As armas são muito legais e os sons são bem interessantes
O jogo é muito variado devido ao ""Diretor"", ele é como se fosse um ser místico que coordena tudo que acontece conforme a partida vai rolando
Nenhuma partida é igual, os especiais vão aparecer em locais diferentes em toda partida e são alternados
A sonorização ambiente é impecável, todas as ações e especiais tem um som distinto. E se o jogo fizer silêncio, você vai poder ouvir tiros e outros sons que indicam que outras pessoas estão por aí
O jogo tem uma variedade muito massa nos mapas, no evento do alarme no shopping em uma partida o jogo vai te levar por um caminho e em outra partida o caminho muda
Não são grandes mudanças no mapa mas ainda deixa a experiência um pouco diferente cada vez que você joga, em uma parte que você passa por um cemitério, o caminho que você faz nesse labirinto de estruturas muda sempre  
E tudo isso é o jogo original, só que tem vários bônus
Todas as campanhas do primeiro jogo estão disponíveis com algumas leves diferenças aqui no segundo jogo (Ainda sim recomendo jogar o 1, a experiência é realmente diferente e mais sombria)
Além disso temos campanhas extra, como por exemplo a ""The Passing"" e a campanha ""The Last Stand""
E a parte mais interessante é Oficina da Steam
Na oficina você pode encontrar mapas feitos pela comunidade, que tem uma qualidade excepcional
Na oficina você também pode encontrar mods para substituir todas as armas do jogo, as que eu mais gosto são as tiradas de jogos de tiro mais focados no realismo, como ""Ready or Not"" ou algum Call of Duty
Com alguns mods gráficos conseguimos dar uma renovada boa no visual do jogo que envelheceu bem, mas ja está meio datado | This game is an excellent choice for players who love co-op chaos and visceral, over-the-top combat. It may not appeal to those seeking deep storytelling, but it delivers pure action-packed fun."

とりあえず色々やってみようと歩いてたら突然死んだ | Don't waste you money on this. I really don't know if they game is incomplete or is mean to be like this...  when i installed it it send me to the page of the game ""RIP - Trilogy"", i did have to clic on the download demo to be able to start the game. 

A lot of black screens where you only hear weird sounds, poor graphics, my monitor was constantly attemping to adjust resolution. Could get to the first level trying to click some parts of the scenery, send me to a dark screen... go to the menu, click on clues, the game crashes.

I suppose my PC is not compatible with this game... i suppose it may work on olders machines.. i suposse the dark screen are the pre-render videos... do you want to try your luck? | Awful game. Every in-game video tries to change the screen resolution, and due to a bug the subtitles are not displayed.

The gameplay is pretty bad, slow and boring. Every time you click on something you must wait for an animation to finish. I don't want to play this game again.

Avoid at all costs! |  Безусловно в игре есть своя атмосфера, и если знать английский и понимать о чём идёт реч в видео (хотя возможно видео у вас не запустится, запускал через 2 видеокарты у меня был только звук и чёрный экран) и что написано в записках, то возможно игра вам понравится.
 В игре есть баги, примитивная(ужасно неудобная) стема управления персонажем (мышь only) всего 3 варианта разрешения экрана (800х600, 1024х768, 1280х1024) и неудобное меню.
 Помойму вместо игры вышла бы отличная короткометражка, но что есть то есть. | Vigil: Blood Bitterness, known as Vinci instead of Vigil at some point, it a point'n'click adventure game by French indie studio Freegamer. Came out in 2006, I think. It was actually supposed to be part of episodic series. As you see, it never got past Episode 1.

The setting of the game is about the cultists vs The Evil. So it's cool. That's as much as I am going to say, enjoy the rest. Sorta. Technical awfulness aside.

To launch the game you actually have to 'activate' RIP - Trilogy game's demo. No idea how this is related, but it's an epic fail, yes. Since I couldn't find demo on Steam store itself, I had to use a link off Steam Database site, search for AppID 2560. Then you will be to launch the game, even if Steam ends up doing nothing on demo download command.

Then I think you should pick resolution in the middle. Not sure of this tho.

Then here is another trick. You can change between Windowed and Fullscreen with Alt+Enter. So, the cutscenes, including text clues, don't work in Fullscreen. However, in Windowed mode the game goes into widescreen mode. Widescreen in a sense that it cuts space that is above and below which makes it impossible to advance through some screens of action. So you want to switch between both, with it reseting to non-widescreen when you go in and out of game's menu. And even then, it can randomly freeze on black screen while doing so.

So the game is incredible pain in the butt to play and you should watch walkthrough on YouTube instead.
Frankly, it's not that good of an adventure game either, but yeh."

The other benefit is this is great for a LAN party as this game is an amazing multiplayer game offering 6+ AI or human players.  The game is small but nostalgically relevant.  It's a great time with friends and allows for some quick paced Armageddon.  It's really alot of fun and its great to pick up have a couple games to warm up in a game night then move to other games.

76561197999259031,24420,Aquaria,0.0,Indie,0,"Под описание к данной игре, на мой взгляд, подходит выражение: от любви до ненависти один шаг. И игра Aquaria тот самый случай, когда негатив, от прохождения игры, порой тебя накрывает, буквально, с головой. Начинается это с момента, когда ты заплываешь в новую локацию, и поскольку кристаллы сохранения находятся на достаточном удалении друг от друга, тебя убивают и ты начинаешь свое исследование по новой. 
Я привык, что в хороших метройдваниях HP выпадает из всех поверженных врагов. Тут же разработчики пошли по другому пути. HP выпадает далеко не из всех врагов, чаще не выпадает вообще. По мимо этого в игре есть система крафта, когда ты, путем смешивания различных ингредиентов, получаешь продукт с необычными свойствами. С этим есть небольшие заморочки и плюс ко всему теряется темп игры, когда тебе во время ожесточенного боя приходится смешивать ингредиенты, чтобы элементарно подлечиться.
Это и управление в местах, где надо передвигаться по суше. Это отдельный вид боли и потраченных в пустую нервов.
За что же так полюбилась данная игра, дак это гениальная задумка разработчиков. Что как в метройдвании нам, в процессе игры, предстоит совершенствовать главного героя путем приобретения новых форм. И в основе каждой новой формы лежит сочетание звуков и цветов. Т.е. чтобы изменить свою форму надо исполнить определенную последовательность звуков, которые обозначены разными цветами и рисунками. И хорошо, что во время битвы с различными боссами, когда нам для победы требуется использовать несколько форм, они сменяются клавишами цифр на клавиатуре.
Так же музыкальное и визуальное оформление данной игры оставляет добрые положительные эмоции. Имеется и сюжетная история о потерянных воспоминаниях. В общем это те положительные моменты, которые остаются в памяти на долго.
Игру однозначно рекомендую, но порой очень непросто разобраться с отдельными загадками и с методами, как одержать победу над очередным боссом не читая гайдов."

O jogo tem altos aspectos positivos como por exemplo a arte visual, é simples e bem bonitinho, as músicas também são muito boazinhas de ouvir (mesmo depois de um bom tempo) e também, não é apenas puzzle, tem também uma historinha.
O jogo tem uma pegada muito igual a de Super Mario, desde alguns inimigos ou até mesmo o fato de você estar atrás de uma princesa e sempre quando você chega no castelo, ela não está lá.

A principal diferença de Braid nisso tudo é que você pode voltar no tempo. E isso abriu portas pra diversas mecânicas, seja apenas voltar no tempo pra impedir alguma morte, manipular determinados itens ou inimigos que não são afetados pelo tempo diferente de outros, criar clones de si mesmo que recriam todos os passos que você fez ou até mesmo criar campos de força que quanto mais próximo deles, mais devagar o tempo passa. Sério, todas essas mecânicas são muito legais na hora dos puzzles. 

Só que o jogo tem muitos pontos negativos também.

Alguns puzzles são MUITO dificeis, no nível de você se estressar MUITO. O jogo não deixa de nenhuma forma explícito como você deve resolver alguns puzzles, e muitos deles tem uma forma única de resolver e as vezes tão específica mas tão específica que chega a ser ridículo como um ser humano conseguiria pensar em resolver daquela forma. 
A história também é muito fraca e confusa, não faz o menor sentido e é uma leitura muito difícil. Outra coisa é que em vez de contarem aos poucos ao passar de cada fase, o jogo te apresenta um sistema de mundos aonde cada mundo tem um ""lobby"" e lá você pode ler toda a história de uma vez sem animação nenhuma. 
E também, a história não tem nada a ver com os puzzles ou as fases que você está jogando, é como se fossem duas coisas completamente diferentes, história e jogo.

No quesito história dos jogos, por ser um dos primeiros jogos indies mais relevantes ou no quesito puzzle-platform, que é definitivamente um dos mais diferentes que tem, é um jogo muito bom. Pra alguém que não é fã de jogos assim, mas decidiu dar uma chance porque tem muita gente que elogia, é um jogo muito chatinho. 7/10. | 毫无疑问的顶尖设计，游戏内的一切都围绕时间回溯的主题展开，尾声醍醐灌顶。

76561197999259031,29180,Osmos,0.0,"Casual, Indie",0,"Once this was good, but now the keyboard shortcuts dont work and the game freezes the computer (even task manager does not work) | Osmos is a game that admittedly is somewhat special to me, in light that it was one of the items acquired for the still-deemed-to-be-almost-completely-insignificant 8th Grade Graduation event in 2010, yet also a completely baffling, confounding, fundamentally broken experience.

I haven't the foggiest of clues how literally [b]anyone[/b] could try to play through 2 of the three level branches in-game, and not only deem it a [b]finished product[/b] that's ready to send to market, but also charge $10 for it. Similarly, I very much want to know which game everybody that pushed its Metacritic Score up to [b]EIGHTY[/b] was playing, and/or how much of it was done so before passing judgement.

To delve into what's wrong with this slow, plodding, almost-entirely-unengaging disaster, I first need to have you, dear reader, imagine you're playing literally any game with a level (style of game doesn't matter), and end goal for said stage. 

Now imagine that instead of making sure you have even the [b]chance[/b] of [b]starting to play[/b] this level, you instead need to repeatedly pause and generate a new map to make sure the game bothers giving you collision to stand on, then literally anything else that's needed to clear said stage.

I would say “This is at least two levels in Osmos”, however, this analogy is not over, because even if the game you're imagining gives you a starting piece of terrain, allows you to move within it, and grants you the equipment needed to have a chance at beating the stage, no guarantee exists the end goal was generated alongside it, 

This is to say that after spending sometimes up to 10 minutes trying to beat this stage, you can be at the second to last action needed to fulfil the objective, only to find the switch you needed to push, unit you needed to spawn, and/or edge of the platform you need to jump from to get to the goal is completely missing.

Guess what this means you need to do? Keep generating a new map until the basics are granted, then hope the game gave you a complete level that can finished this time around.

[b][u]This is to say that levels in Osmos are not designed, they're generated, and not only that, seemingly nothing by any flags, checks, or programs are in-place to make sure said stage can be completed was bothered to be programmed[/u][/b], making the gameplay loop “play until you get stuck on a level, regenerate said level until you can even start to play it, and hope that the system blessed you with the apparently unheard-of privilege of being able to beat said stage.

I have gone back to this game at least twice since acquiring it almost 15 years ago, and each time, I reached a “level” that's not only entirely reliant on RNG to be able to not only do anything at-all in, but seemingly completely unable to be finished.

The first revisit saw one of the “Force” clusters be perpetually beyond even beginning, and while the A3B cluster seemed doable at first, after – no joke – at least 30 restarts, 1 hour and a half wasted, and only 15 that I wasn't completely blocked out of doing anything with, none of those were finished.

It gets worse, though, because in order to have a chance at defeating any enemy (in this case stationary blobs for most of the levels I bothered even trying to play) you – so to speak – need to take health from yourself, and give it to whichever adversary you may be facing. This already sounds completely unreasonable, but once you assimilate the “Health” of the other enemy, you grow to their size, unable to get through corridors, and use weaker ones to hope to try and beat the bigger ones, while hoping beyond hope nothing happens to give imperative health to your adversary, causing it to grow bigger, and completely block you off from progressing.

[b][u]The fundamental laws of game design state:[/u][/b]

1: If you must have a randomiser take the place of intentional design, include checks, and flags, then redundancy on redundancy to make sure every level can be completed via player agency, and skill, rather than the randomiser putting everything in.

2: Once these are in-place, make absolutely sure that everything it makes can be consistently completed, playing each level multiple times, and perhaps have multiple people also do so, to increase the amount of tested instances/generations.

3: Once everything is confirmed to be working [b][u]then[/u][/b] publish it.

As such, we reach the

[b][u]Verdict:[/u][/b] A seemingly-untested, unfinished-feeling frustration-fest that relies entirely on luck to allow the player to do anything, with two levels either taking hours of restarts to beat, or otherwise are completely impossible to finish.

[b][u]Placed In:[/u][/b] Were this acquired on any other occasion, I would have 0 qualms whatsoever about ousting it from my account such that I never have the temptation to be disappointed by it in the future again, but as it stands, it's shakily at 6: Traumatically Toxic, and “Remove it anyway.” | Klassiker"

Tym razem w trybie single player gracz może poprowadzić do boju oddziały świetnie wyszkolonych Space Marines.

W odróżnieniu od poprzedniej części mamy zdecydowanie większy wpływ na kolejność zajmowanych terytoriów.

Nasze oddziały przed każdą bitwą znajdują się bowiem na statku kosmicznym orbitującym wokół planety, o którą toczy się walka.

Wraz z postępami w grze, wzrasta poziom doświadczenia Kosmicznych Marines, dzięki czemu z zadania na zadanie coraz lepiej radzą sobie w boju.

W Dawn of War 2 dowodzimy oddziałami najczęściej składającymi się tylko z kilku żołnierzy, wobec czego autorzy chcąc, aby gracz łatwiej się z nimi identyfikował postanowili je spersonalizować.

On that note, I have mixed feelings about the new campaign. The difficulty curve is rather steep and the new corruption mechanic is kind of pointless because you have to pretty much skip content in order to gain corruption. Either that or purposely equip increasingly cursed items like an idiot.
On the flip side I like the new psyker unit and the new weapons are welcome additions. I even went out of my way to rotate characters around to try the new gear.
Besides that the game is rather janky these days, especially the sound, so I encountered more technical problems that I care to mention. The highlight of the issues was probably bosses pushing Cyrus outside of the level geometry.
Anyway, that's all I have to say since this is an expansion and not a new game.

Out of all the game this one caused me the least technical issues and it's also the most complete in terms of content so Retribution is the best for playing skirmishes.
Besides that the campaign makes a return with a new party of heroes, this time based off the commander units from the skirmish mode, and the conclusion to the story that started in the first Dawn of War with some pretty cool cutscenes. 
But I saved the best for last: the campaign can be played with all 6 races. They vary in quality but they are all rich on hammy voice acting.
The only issue is that the campaign is always the same with slightly different dialogue. Some elements from skirmish mode are present such as building units but the levels are fairly linear so there's little space for the dynamic battles from actual skirmishes. Also, one of your heroes is always silent and that blows.
In conclusion, I think Retribution is pretty good. It's sad that it never reached the level of polish that Company of Heroes has but Warhammer is obviously more niche than World War 2 so that's understandable."

It is essentially an operational and strategic masterpiece, with the AI doing a decent job.

It combines logical thinking, physics-based mechanics, and an engaging story. The game takes place in Aperture Science, a mysterious and dangerous laboratory filled with test chambers. The player controls Chell, a silent protagonist who must escape using the Portal Gun. This device allows players to create two linked portals on surfaces, making it possible to teleport and solve puzzles.

One of the most impressive aspects of Portal 2 is its level design. Each test chamber introduces new mechanics, forcing players to think creatively. The game starts with simple puzzles but gradually becomes more complex. Elements like light bridges, propulsion gel, and lasers add depth to the challenges. The difficulty curve is perfect, making the game enjoyable for both beginners and experienced players.

Portal 2 also stands out with its story and humor. The main antagonist, GLaDOS, is a sarcastic and witty AI who constantly insults and manipulates the player. Wheatley, a clumsy and funny robot, adds another layer of comedy. Their dialogues make the game more entertaining and memorable. Despite its humor, the story also explores themes of control, identity, and artificial intelligence.

Another great feature of Portal 2 is its cooperative mode. Unlike the single-player campaign, co-op requires teamwork and communication. Players control two robots, Atlas and P-Body, solving puzzles that require coordination. This mode enhances the experience, making it even more enjoyable when played with a friend.

差不多7年前，我的小学同学就发现了这款大作，那时手机版还没有心动，只有应用商店里的1.2版本，对于当时的我们，手机版1.2只有两个滑轮键控制移动和瞄准，并且局域网联机方便，十分益于上手。我和几个哥们一放假就聚在一起play。当时我们卡在世纪之花这个boss，就聚在学校小花园商量战术，没想到我自己直接单挑过了，还有我第一次打过肉山，是拿蜜蜂手雷和它同归于尽，真的很怀念1.2陪伴我的时光，之后1.2下架，国服代理，为了玩上1.3的泰拉，我在好游快爆苦苦地种玉米（当时可以以此换取游玩资格，否则就要花钱），没想到最后发现还需要早起抢购资格，而我当时可能在上学，没有抢到，努力直接白费。我和同学只能在网上寻找那些还没下架1.2的网站继续玩。
从小学到了初中，以前玩泰拉的朋友各奔东西，但我对泰拉的热情依然不减，后来出了手游国际版我便立即下载，顶着看不懂的英文，摸索1.3的机制，专家模式掉落的装备我都从未见过，新鲜感和好奇心油然而生，初中期间我也找到了一两个一起玩的，使我不至于太孤独。疫情之前，我从来都是只玩手机版泰拉，知道疫情上网课，我终于有机会玩上电脑版了。当时的我对电脑并不精通，也不知道steam是什么东西，于是就在360浏览器直接搜泰拉瑞亚，经过一天的寻找，我也是下到了盗版泰拉（当时我也不知道正版要买）就这么在电脑上再通关了一遍普通模式，但这次没有任何人陪伴，只有我一个人。
终于到了高中，我了解了正规的steam渠道，在打折期间花18块钱买了正版泰拉，为童年补了票，高二认识了几个志同道合的同学，一起玩了灾厄，也是乐在其中。如今，我即将成人，步入大学生活，但我的泰拉之旅还在继续，玩了十几年游戏，只有泰拉瑞亚给我的印象最深，给我带来的乐趣最多，对于陪伴了我78年的老伙计，打多少星已经不重要了，真没想到我能写这么多，回顾了一遍我的童年，我的眼里有些模糊。 | --{ Gráficos }---

☐ No recomendado | I have over 2k hours in this game, and I think I can safely say it's infinitely replayable and incredibly enjoyable. Great bosses, fun stat progression, sandbox building, etc. Highly recommend. | Очень классная игра. Давно играю в него спустя с мобильной версии террарии. Когда перешёл на пк версию, то было ещё веселее и приятнее. Жаль конечно что старые мобы, вещи, боссы пропали с телефонной версии, но так приятно о них вспоминать и проходить их в тмодлорде. Люблю эту игру | The game is fabulous, but a bit more handholding at the very beginning would be nice, because the moment the game started, I had no idea what I was supposed to do or how I was supposed to build anything or use my inventory, so the first few minutes were horrendous, and I was dying quite a lot, which reminded me why I instantly deleted this game many years ago when trying to play it for the very first time. This time around I decided to keep at it, and the first 10–15 hours were slow, but then I got the hang of it, and the game consumed me to the point where I lost track of time and racked up 100 hours just completing the main story and hunting for some achievements. Be prepared to keep your browser running in the background, because you are probably going be switching between the game and the Terraria Wiki quite a lot."
76561197999259031,91700,E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy,5.75,"Action, Indie, RPG",8,"Game goes hard and is complex, VERY COMPLEX! But it has some cool story line. | Hyper obscure RPG FPS with a plot line in so many various threads that somehow still works. Not a game for everyone but if you want to be confused about your own morality and whatever the hell is going on while shooting things, great game. | Weird game, obtuse plot that sniffs its own butt quite a lot. Oddly fun though, especially with friends. This is the most lukewarm of my recommends, because I'm acutely aware some people will hate it, but if you like janky shooters with jankier plots but lofty ideas. You'll have a good time with it. | I bought this game because a lot of people said that it's like Brigand : Oaxaca. It's not.  At least from what I can tell.  The visuals and combat are more polished here but, it's missing the heart and atmosphere of Brigand.  Brigand is the superior game of the two in my opinion. Eye is alright.  But, it's just yet another dark cyberpunk adventure set in yet another boring dark Urban Hellscape.    At least the guns and skills help set in apart a little. | This game is often listed as rough around the edges but it is a genuinely smoother game than I expected. It is confusing at first but the more you play the more it makes sense. The game initially started as a Half Life 2 mod. 

Pros:
- Immersive world with factions, temples, battle priests, gangs, space mutants, and cyberpunk settings.
- An actual FPS/RPG with cool class builds, Counter Strike/Stalker-like gunplay, and narrative choices.
- It is biased but I am tired of most open-world games unless it really is something new or out of left field. The hub-oriented mission design has been refreshing despite the older game philosophy. Spoiler: [spoiler] The repeating nature of the story with your upgraded character is a welcome change to massive open world games going from one POI to another.[/spoiler]
- Source Engine games really have some of the best atmosphere/lighting.
- Pretty short game time. Without spoiling there is a lot to do but you can beat the campaign in about 8-12 hours. Not every game needs to be hundreds of hours.

Cons:
- The game really encumbers players early on with low endurance/movement speed. It is recommended to upgrade your cyberlegs as soon as you can to increase movement. You are forced into certain upgrades before you can customize your build.
- The level design is not the greatest. You go through a variety of environments but a lot of the spaces are barren and empty at times. 
- Movement could be a little better. This game has Q and E leaning but you can only do it when stationary which is tough.
- A lot of the story/lore is dumped to you in the archives section. I thought it worked for the game since it is about an esoteric group of cyber warrior priests so it's fitting that they would have their history inside a library. This is not the game if you are looking for cutscenes.
- Enemy spawning is an issue at times but for some reason it didn't bother me as much as it should.

If you are interested in single player FPS with RPG elements then this is a game to absolutely check out. It is considered unforgiving but the satisfaction you gain in progressing your character along with learning the world makes this a remarkable game. I really wish this company would continue working on this series rather than making Warhammer games.

76561197999259031,42160,Unknown,0.4666666666666667,,0,"I've played over 1000 hours of this game. I've seen it from it's conception to it's end. 
The community of this game is unlike any other I've ever encountered in an online group. They are vindictive, rude and destructive to the game. Throughout the entire time I played I suffered no end of trolling, mocking and the like. There were people that literally exploited the kicking function to get me off of servers so I could not play the game I paid for. 
The issue also lies with the developers whom constantly ignored community begging to get hackers out. Even to this day, after an anti-cheat patch, the game is STILL cracked, people running around with weapons they shouldn't, running fast, swinging faster than is possible. Some people even exploit the bad latency issues to win. 

There's a top 1% in this game, they are not skilled players by any stretch. Instead of skill they got together and figured out what the best ways to exploit the games mechanics. From unblockable hits to builds that were simply insanely unfair, they scared away any new players to the game by trying their best to ruin the fun for others. To this day, even now, I get on and someone is taking my Steam ID name so they can spam vote kicks so I can't play. 

Stay far, far away from this game. Think of World of Warcraft only cultivated with the worst of the worst (community) possible. The truth is I enjoyed this game but the playerbase was hellbent on seeing it go under. You have honest, fun people who are endlessly frustrated by the trolls, hackers and exploiters. 

There is no welcome mat here, just a gigantic letdown. | Покупка была многообещающей, и в начале я был доволен. Но потом розы становились все хуже и хуже. Это надо было очень хорошо постараться так испортить игру. Розы спасает только то хорошее, что осталось, да и известность издателя Paradox Interactive.
[b][h1]Какие же достоинства есть у роз?[/h1][/b]
[list]
[*] Приятная графика
[*] Настройка оружия, разные виды оружия
[*] Возможность создать своих уникальных персонажей (при покупке полной версии, естественно)
[*] Неплохая боевая система, прямо как в Mount&Blade
[*] Наличие дуэльных серверов, где запрещены лучники, толпой на одного лезть нельзя и можно потренироваться.
[/list]
[b][h1]Теперь к недостаткам:[/h1][/b]
[list]
[*] Система ударов и блоков реализована, ИМХО, криво, хотя задумка [b]правильная[/b]. В Mount&Blade похожая система, но там если хочешь ударить [b]сверху[/b], то и ударяешь [b]сверху[/b], а тут так бывает далеко не всегда.
[*] Куча игроков-спамеров, которые размахивают без конца [b]двуручным[/b] оружием, [b]вообще не делая блоки[/b], а ты просто не успеваешь заблокировать атаки, ибо некоторые двуручники, видимо, ничего не весят, и спамить ими можно на ура, даже при промахах
[*] Ограничения на количество лучников в команде не было и нет, очень весело становится, когда ими все кишит - бегаешь и умираешь чуть что. А еще учитывая возрождение возле лидера - пять лучников могут собраться в один отряд и стрелять, сколько душе угодно, возрождаясь сразу же на удобных позициях. Я то и не против самих лучников, но нужно или увеличить время респавна для них, если их много, или запретить возрождаться возле лидера. Повторюсь, ЕСЛИ ИХ МНОГО. Несколько лучников придает бою адреналина, а куча - напрочь убивает удовольствие.
[*] Раздражают ролики с собственной казнью от первого лица. Пусть будет выбор - отображать ролики с казнью или просто надпись внизу ""вас прикончили"". Почему мне навязывают жестокость, не давая выбора? 
[*] Серверов мало, игроков мало, нужно подбирать время, чтобы были заполненные и с хорошим пингом
[*] На ДУЭЛЬНЫХ серверах почему-то [b]разрешены казни[/b]. Что за чертовщина? Этикет таких серверов подразумевает запрет на казни в принципе, разработчики же не пожелали сделать кпопочку в настройках сервера ""запретить казни"", они оставили все на контроль админам серверов, которые как бы должны наказывать нарушителей и которые на сервере не столь часто, к тому же бывает, что на ДУЭЛЬНОМ сервере админ ни черта не банит, как будто так и надо. Я молчу про кучу лучников и наезд толпой,  вообще-то запрещенных на таких серверах, на которые тоже некоторым админам пофигу.
[*] Где баланс  команд по уровню прокачанности? Не завезли.
[*] Лаги, лаги, лаги. С 2012 года разрабы все никак не могут оптимизировать движок и до сих пор те, у кого компьютеры тянут всякие крайзисы с батлфилдами на максимальных, и интернет хороший, недоумевают, какого черта так лагает
[*] Разрабам положить на игру. Ну вот серьезно, гляньте на список исправлений,  даже античит выкатывался достаточно долго.
[*] Доспехи порезаны не напильником, а болгаркой, теперь тяжелые носить смысла нет, ибо теряешь в скорости, а взамен - только защита от бокового удара мечом и кинжала.

Хорошо, что купил по скидке, было бы намного обиднее заплатить треть стоимости  ААА-проектов, где разработчики заняты улучшением продукта, а не непонятно чем. Я очень много играл в Mount&Blade и хотел бы, чтобы розы взяли оттуда лучшее.
[u]Игра очень нуждается в доработке[/u], хотя на что я надеюсь... Акулы пойдут и наштампуют еще 10 проектов, зачем улучшать старое, выкатят раз в полгода патч, который ничего не изменит, да и все.
Чувствую, сейчас фанаты, в упор не видящие недостатков в игре, опустят обзор по максимуму. Ну дело ваше, только вот, к сожалению, недостатки в розах не исправятся от того, что вы утопите обзор.
В обзоре присутствуют удачно подмеченные моменты от Malakhur, Shoers, *T!gRa, Doomer и других. | At its peak, this was one of my favorite games of all time, the combat mechanics were deep and had a steep learning curve, the armor system was very complex and logical, and above all this game rewarded the skill of the players. 

Of the 140 hours I've played, roughly 100 of them were spent on dueling servers fighting 1on1 with other players, all of whom were there because they enjoyed the actual competition or to master their skills with a new weapon. The dueling community was strong and friendly, always willing to help teach new players how to survive the game. 

But then the Devs changed things, the armor system simplified, the weapons became more powerful, crossbows became sniper rifles, hitboxes and crit chances grew, and the art of dueling was lost to the ether; replaced by polearm decapitations, across the map crossbow headshots, and stab spamming. All that is left now is the empty rotting shell of a once great game. | This game has an absolutely TERRIBLE community. It's absolutely toxic and leaves to room for enjoyment. This game is fun, but there is nothing but people you never want to meet in person. 

It's disgusting. Sadly, it ruins the game entirely. Duel servers are the worst hands down, filled with people who are both hypocritical, and completely immature.

I'd skip this one for the community alone. | Als das Spiel noch einen normalen Preis hatte war es sehr gut.
Die Grafik überzeugt und das Gameplay fand ich zu der Zeit noch ansprechender als das von seinem Marktbegleiter (Chivalry Medival Warfare).
Gerade weil man den Charakter weitergehend modifizieren konnte und man direkt auf Waffen sparen konnte.
Die Kämpfe haben Spaß gemacht und auch als Bogenschütze waren die Kämpfe anspruchsvoll aber nicht unfair.

Inzwischen ist alles anders.
Seit das Spiel Freemium (Free2Play) ist, sind die Preise der Waffen und Rüstungsteile um Faktor X gestiegen.
Inzwischen kosten fast alle waffen 100.000 Gold (umgerechnet 5-10 €?). Und das ohne weitere Upgrades.
Da die Waffen aber alle unterschiedliche Stats haben und man eine tatsächliche Ewigkeit bräuchte um das Geld in Schlachten zu verdienen ist das Spiel zu Pay2Win verkommen.

Ganz zu schweigen von den ganzen Griefern und Glitchern die selbst Standard-DM zur Hölle machen.
Rennen weg, springen auf Zäune/Dächer/Palmen(?) und verstecken sich irgendwie in Heuballen, die man selbst weder betreten kann - noch bei denen man in der Lage ist Schaden zuzufügen.
Während ich früher (Großteil meiner Spielzeit) mit positiven Stats aus dem Spiel gehn konnte.. wäre es jetzt wohl eine KD von 1/10. Ich nehme auch an dass das Game inzwischen hackerverseucht ist.. wills aber auch nicht wissen.

Das Spiel ist für mich gestorben und würde ich niemandem mehr weiter empfehlen.
So wie S4 League. Gratulation Spieleentwickler. Es ist euch wieder gelungen ein gutes Spiel schlecht zu machen.

76561197999259031,49470,Magic: The Gathering - Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012,38.53333333333333,Strategy,19,"Let me tell you about Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012. It’s one of those games that’s technically still around (if you bought it back in the day), but good luck finding it if you didn’t—it’s no longer available for purchase on Steam. And that’s a shame because this game was an absolute gateway into Magic: The Gathering, wrapped up in a neat little digital package.

The gameplay was its biggest draw. You weren’t thrown into the deep end with deck-building or forced to buy card packs. Instead, you got preconstructed decks, each with its own flavor and strategy. It was perfect for newcomers who wanted to learn without getting overwhelmed and for veterans who just wanted to sit back and enjoy some streamlined battles.

The campaign gave you a solid progression system, challenging you with AI opponents that represented Magic’s iconic planeswalkers. And let’s not forget those puzzles. They weren’t just “win this match” scenarios; they were bite-sized brain teasers that tested how well you really understood the game’s mechanics. Solving them felt like a mini-victory every time.

Visually, it wasn’t flashy by today’s standards, but it had just enough flair to keep you immersed. The card art was always the star, as it should be. Spell effects were simple but satisfying, and the battlefield layout kept everything clean and easy to follow.

Multiplayer, though—that’s where this game really shined. Archenemy mode was a fan favorite, letting three players team up to take down an overpowered AI opponent. It was a blast, especially with friends. And while the PvP aspect wasn’t as deep as you’d get with physical Magic or something like MTG Arena, it was more than enough to keep things interesting.

Now, speaking of MTG Arena—yes, it’s on Steam now, and it’s great in its own right. But let’s be real: it’s not Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012. Arena is all about competitive ladder climbing and card collecting, while Duels focused on making Magic accessible and fun without the grind. No campaign, no Archenemy, just straight-up one-on-one battles. That’s fine, but it doesn’t scratch the same itch.

If you were lucky enough to buy Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 before it disappeared, you can still download and play it today. And honestly, it holds up. It’s a reminder of a simpler time in digital Magic—a time when you didn’t need a credit card or hours of research to enjoy a game of cards. And yes, I know they had DLC content available to buy content and decks.

So yeah, this game might be off the market, but for those of us who played it, it’s a classic. And for anyone looking for something similar, MTG Arena is worth a look—but don’t expect it to capture the same magic (pun intended)."

Being new to PC gaming and Steam sales, I'm beginning to develop taste for ultra short campaigns with densely packed novelty, fun, excitement, or whatever I can shake out of a $3 game.

 단순히 선만 그리는 게 아니라 도형이나 핀, 로프 등을 만들 수 있어서 정말 다양한 풀이 방법을 시도할 수 있는 게 재밌었습니다. 그려진 선과 도형들이 중량을 가지는 점이 정말 다양한 결과를 만들어내네요. 유튜브에서 클리어영상을 보면 이렇게도 할 수 있구나 싶은 기상천외한 방법들을 보여줘서, 이미 클리어한 스테이지를 다시 한 번 해보는 재미도 있었습니다. 

 다만 추가 별을 획득하기 위해서는 과제를 달성해야 하는데, 다양한 시도를 할 수 있다는 장점이 퇴색되는 감이 있어 그 부분은 불만이었습니다. 추가 별을 획득하지 못하면 최종목표인 별 120개에는 부족하기 때문인데, 물론 하나만 그려 해결하는 방법을 궁리하는 재미도 있긴 하지만, 결국은 핀으로 오브젝트 고정해 공을 때려 움직이거나 무게 치우치게 만들어 지렛대로 공을 옮기는 방법으로 해결하게 되니까요. 각 스테이지마다 추가별 획득과제가 달랐다면 모르겠는데, 다 같은 과제다 보니 시도하는 해결법이 대부분 비슷해지게 됩니다. 
 재밌을 것 같은 방법이 떠오르면 과제 클리어 후에 다시 해봐야 한다는 점이 좀 아쉽네요.

Now, I am leaving a review so I can actually lay this game to rest properly and remember just why I stopped playing it.

Long story short: the RNG is unbearable and the AI is too unforgiving. This game essentially has you play a mix of solitaire and poker against an AI and, to spice things up a bit, you can use power cards as well to turn the tide. The problem is that the AI simply never ever lets you play any move that may be advantageous for you, as it constantly steals useful cards the moment it sees them. The reason this happens is that every ""player"" gets 3 moves in one turn, and thus the AI constantly ruins your plans the moment they seem to come to fruition.

That combined with the card appearance RNG just makes the game very frustrating. You are essentially fighting a battle on two fronts; on one front, you hope for RNG to give you the right cards to make good combinations with and that you can securely tuck away in a combination before the AI can steal it; on the other front, you fight an AI that always goes for the best available combinations anyway while ruining your day. It is a battle only won with a lot of luck and patience, but sadly, it is not very fun. While the presentation of the game is intriguing, it is simply not worth going through the struggle. | The core concept of this game is essentially solitare poker againt the AI.  Matching varying combinations of cards will inflict damage against the AI (and AI to you).  The damage will increase the better the combiation, from two of a kind to a royal flush.    The game mixes things up by adding in spell cards which can be used to inflict status effects, heal, do elemental damage, etc.  The additions of the spell cards keeps the battle fresh as certain enemies require specific cards to counter their abilities.  Overall, this game is average to above-average.  I recommend a purchase of this game during a sale. | The core combat of making poker hands to fight enemies is pretty fun. The game is very shallow and has a very lackluster story with choices that impact absolutely nothing.

📝 [b][u]Story[/u][/b]

Man schlüpft in die Rolle von Raziel. Zumindest hatte ich das gesamte Spiel über das Gefühl dass der ""Changeling"", wie der Hauptcharakter heißt, dem guten Raziel aus Legacy of Kain ähnelt, weshalb er für mich das gesammte Spiel über diesen Namen trug. 

Die gesamte Handlung spielt in einem alternativen mittelalterlichen Europa und bezieht sich sehr oft auf die nordische Mythologie. Die Geschichte ist gut geschrieben und macht eigentlich gerade am Ende Lust auf mehr.

🎮 [b][u]Gameplay[/u][/b]

Spielerisch ist es recht simpel. Außerhalb von Kämpfen bewegt man sich über eine Weltkarte mit festen Pfaden. Auf diesen sind mehrere Punkte, von denen einige einfach passiert werden, während andere einen in einen Kampf schicken. 

Die Kämpfe werden dann durch ein rundenbasiertes Kartenspiel ausgetragen, welches eine Mischung aus Solitaire und Poker ist. Das Kampfsystem ist recht schnell erlernt, insbesondere wenn man mit einem oder beiden Kartenspielen schon vertraut ist. Verschiedene Zusatzkarten und Power-Ups ergänzen das Spiel und machen die Kämpfe interessanter. 

Leider wird es nach einigen Stunden doch etwas langweilig, da die KI nicht sonderlich effektiv spielt und nur sehr selten starke Kombinationen wie einen Royal Straight Flush anstrebt. Dadurch wird es auch zum Ende hin eher leichter als schwerer, da man dann mehr Leben hat und somit auch genug Zeit um auf die Kombinationen hinzuarbeiten die am meisten bringen.


🎥 [b][u]Grafik[/u][/b]

Die Grafik ist gut. Die einzelnen Bildschirme sind sehr übersichtlich und man kommt jederzeit an wichtige Informationen heran. Die Kartenmotive der Zusatzkarten sind teilweise ziemlich schick und auch das Gegner- und Charakterdesign ist gelungen. Zudem fand ich die kurzen Filme wunderschön anzusehen, insbesondere der Anfangsfilm ist  beeindruckend für ein solches Spiel. 

🎶 [b][u]Sound[/u][/b]

Musik und Soundeffekte sind ok, auch wenn ich es sehr Schade finde, dass die einzelnen Texte nicht vertont wurden. Auch etwas mehr Atmosphäre in den einzelnen Stücken wäre noch schön gewesen aber im Endeffekt ist die Vertonung ausreichend.

❤︎ [b][u]Fazit [/u][/b]

Insgesamt ein nettes Spiel für einige Stunden. Wer etwas kurzes oder was für Zwischendurch sucht ist hier genau richtig und auch Kartenspielfans kommen auf ihre kosten.

D'abord, le contexte. 
On joue un gars qui sait pas très bien d'où il vient ni qui il est mais une chose est sûr, le destin du monde repose sur lui...
Ouais.
On pourrait excuser une histoire simpliste si le reste compensait mais non, les dialogues sont longs, le choix des réponses ne sert à rien et du coup tout ce qui et sensé donner une identité au jeu et de la profondeur manque cruellement.

Reste la musique pour s'immerger...et quelle musique! 
Là encore, manque d'identité, impressionante par son air de déjà-entendu (je suis quasiment sûr que c'est du copier-coller) et complètement rébarbative. Etant donné qu'il n'y a qu'une musique pour les phases de combat et que le jeu n'en est qu'une longue suite, j'ai fini, par repect pour mes oreilles, par la couper dans les options.

Du coup, qu'est-ce qu'il reste?
Des parties de cartes type solitaire de windows/poker contre des monstres avec un système de rage, de magie et la possibilité d'avoir en jeu des cartes action/bonus. On se déplace sur la carte en fonction des quêtes à accomplir et voilà tout.

Le jeu est propre, facile à prendre en main, tout est en anglais mais facile à comprendre, la difficulté assez élevée.
Si on vous l'offre ou s'il est en réduction, prenez-le si, comme moi, vous vouliez au moins un jeu de carte dans votre ludothèque."

I have tried so many other ego-shooters and nothing can compete gameplay-wise for my taste. | This game is hard to review. There are a lot of tactics involved in this World War 2 game when it comes down to finding a good position and deciding when to take more territory. Overall great WW2 shooter and map design! On the other hand, the devs did a sloppy job when it came to removing the single player campaign because they were incapable of making it work. I've never heard of a game developer removing this much from a game. It's a first. They also kept the single player achievements and promised to fix it later even though the campaign was removed. Kick the bucket down the road. Then they said the game is too old so the devs won't fix it. There is also an impossible achievement because of a progress bug the devs screwed up on and gave everyone who had the bug an achievement called inb4reset which is not a reward for something the player did but a mistake from the devs  so it was a limited time achievement. Weird and unheard of to get an achievement for the developers mistake for bugging everyone's progress. I just find it very strange. There are a lot of other bugs and problems with the game. It is still a great multiplayer game. So I'll let you decide if this game is right for you. If achievements are not important to you, and you want to get another WW2 shooter, then I say go for it. You also shouldn't expect any bug fixes because support is basically non-existent. | Гениальная игра, погружающая тебя в те страшные времена. Несмотря на то, что маленький онлайн, играть всё равно очень интересно | Best to make new friends and meet unique people, I 100% recommend buying this game as soon it gets on sale!

This game may be ancient but it still holds out great! Especially with the although shy but funny community nonetheless.
Each campaign makes you feel like you're in some story or a movie and it can be really immersive at times.
(I'm looking at you Leica)

This game has made me feel anxious , rage, shed tears, overwhelmed with joy and compassion.

This game is a hidden gem and I hope we meet together in the frontlines!

Bir klasik.
Birinci şahıs, hızlı, mermi cehennemi ve yaratık öldürmenin ilk adreslerinden.
Hala oynanabilirliğini koruyan oyunun remastered versiyonlarına da steamden ulaşabilirsiniz. 
Henüz  hiç oynamadıysanız ve bu tarz oyunları seviyorsanız denemelisiniz.
Belirli dönemlerde toplu paketleri yüksek indirime giriyor. | Probably the best Serious Sam game. Lots of big fights, trapped ammo/health pickups, and silliness. You need to quicksave often because the game isn't remotely fair. The first few levels are a bit slow and annoying because you don't have all the weapons yet.

Unless you're playing on tourist/easy, the gameplay isn't just dumb shooting. You have to prioritize enemies and switch weapons constantly, otherwise you will get overwhelmed. It is a unique type of gameplay.

Compared to the  ""Classics: Revolution"" version: this one works better.
Compared to the HD version (or Fusion), this original version has a few gravity gimmick rooms that weren't ported over. It doesn't matter much.
Compared to The Second Encounter, this has fewer enemy types and weapons, and only one setting (Egypt), but more big difficult fights.
Compared to SS2, this is much less goofy.
Compared to SS3 and later, this has no NPCs talking in your ear, no running, ~no reloading, no aim-down-sights. | Serious Sam, the game that defined a generation of PC shooters. I have beaten the First Encounter like I think 9 times on the different versions, but getting this for mods and stuff is a good decision. Overall you should totally play this game, it's worth it to play the classic first. | Compre este juego por que se lo regale a mi pareja y me lo compre para mi tambien por que tenia modo online y venia con un pack de 3 juegos , hace 1 semana lo jugue por mi pareja en dificultad dificil y fue tan horrible y hermoso a la vez no saber un choto y que el me alla enseñado algunos secreto me salvo pero ufff me hizo enojar demasiado este juego pero es un juegazo ahora voy a jugar el segundo encuentro | Игра обладает замечательной динамикой, интерес к игровому процессу сохраняется до последнего момента, присутствует яркая и насыщенная графика, а также потрясающая музыка. Следует отметить как недостатки скучного финального босса и странную завершающую сцену.

Compared to the First Encounter, this has more environments, more enemy types, more weapons, more gimmicks and new powerups.

There is an HD version of this game which looks better but lacks a few gravity gimmick rooms, and the sounds are changed. | Bu oyunu First Encounter oyunundan daha fazla beğendim First encounter sürekli mısır civarında geçtiği için insanı biraz sıkıyor fakat bu oyunda 3 farklı bölge olması daha etkileyici kılmış oyunu | It's a good game, but a lot of people smack the First Encounter down because it doesn't have as many mods and it doesn't have weapons and enemies.

Revolution just gives you extra stuff. | This game is fun for about 4 levels and then is really annoying. | 英雄萨姆，在上个世纪FPS刚起步时，开辟了一条在现在也很少有的玩法主题
一个人VS一个军队
游戏玩法非常简单，带着远高于所有FPS差不多3倍的弹药，去挑战远远多于一般FPS5倍的敌人
相当于FPS版的无双游戏，大概在同屏数量上，萨姆做到了FPS中的空前绝后
敌人也不仅仅是愚蠢的近战单位，而是包括负责用数量淹死你的冲锋前锋，攻速慢但多的杂兵
配合重型单位以及骚扰远程输出，在后期往往一关的一场战斗，都会有几十个单位蜂拥而来
而你要做的就是像个移动炮台一样，走位输出狂轰滥炸，不要担心弹药因为防守战补给会无限间隔刷新
你只需要专注超度这群，奇形怪状的外星侵略者就行了
英雄萨姆的故事也很神奇，是按照4312的顺序从外星人开始入侵地球（4），地球被外星人毁灭（3）
萨姆穿越回过去（1），开始前往外星人老家（1代资料片），然后踹他外星人BOSS的ASS（2）
不过这个故事目前没有结束，止步于2打到了BOSS老家
只是为了玩初代的话基本买这部就可以了，这部包含了初代本体和资料片二次出击以及额外关卡光明岛
看评论说有HD版，但本来就是老游戏再怎么HD也一个德行区别不大所以我是不在乎这个的
游戏地图设计就是杀杀杀，和找开关，我是觉得开关不难找，毕竟有锁的地方开关都在附近
地图也都不太大找找总能找到，主要是有时候他放开关钥匙的地方，会放在某条路的尽头
你得杀个百八十个敌人才能过去，而且资料片和额外关卡的关卡地形特别容易摔死，就很烦
所以买之前最好确认自己是不是喜欢这种游戏，毕竟对不喜欢的人来说相当于疯狂堆怪X3
可能会比较坐牢，顺便一提完全打通每一关至少需要24小时，地形是摔下即死，稍微忘了快捷存档
摔0死了就要从头开始就挫败感很强，但如果你能适应，这游戏打折也就5块，就会了解到什么叫极具性价比"

Well, there were games like Half-Life 2 back in 2000s, of course, but not every game was even close to that level. Still, this game starts like horror of some sort and I think it should have kept such style. But apparently devs had different vision. By the way you can try to play it on easy because the game is pretty damn hard. | This is a hard negative review but I cannot put a neutral one so be it then. It is from 2006 but even for these standards the writing is just atrocious - they started strong with some survival horror mechanics just to go full generic mediocre alien shoter clone in just next part where you have just to kill and move and watch not to die - not very much to be expecting from. The voice acting is just bad, the story is just bland and the ending - well it is anticlimactic. Nostalgia prevents me from shitting on this game byt it is not strong enough to pat it on the head. | Топовая для своих лет игрулька .Купил из ностальгии ( как-как найдя в интернете её название ) , но если быть не придирчивым, то неплохой шутер с видом сверху с малым элементом хоррора , а  если по шаманить в папках разрешение и настройки графики , так и ещё графон не самый плохой будет! | cheap and amazing! good game!"

If you get graphical glitches, espetially around water: turn off Anti-Aliasing. | Shadowgrounds: Survivor does fix some of the problems with previous game like lackluster physix, voiceacting and story but it is still plagued by bugs from previous game - looking at you shotgun glitch. The game brings overall better experience while writing still has lot to be desired at least it doesn't try to play the horror this time - it just is shoter from beginning to start, it doesn't try to scare us just it points us into general direction and asks to shot things. While it is not much it cuts enough to be a better part despite being around half as short. | Had a little trouble getting this to run at first, but after installing the legacy PhysX drivers like people say then it ran great.

Overall this game is some run-and-gun dumb fun! It borrows a lot from Doom, but the mechanics and perspective are quite unique. I love that it doesn't outstay it's welcome - I can imagine if they had artificially stretched it out then it would have gotten very boring, but the pacing seems just right.

One things that's quite a shame is I wish they had polished this a bit more, from the menu screens to a little bit of jankyness in game, I feel like a little more dev time could have made this shine. But that aside, just go have some quick fun with this here and there."

first and foremost, dead game. has been dead for a while, and games like this tend to need players to unlock its best gameplay.

but the most important thing that holds this back is the bots. i've played countless RTS games against AI and the likes. there are plenty of RTS games where there also is little to no players, but i enjoy them because i can still play a typical game against an AI opponent. in this game, there is no RTS commander, and therefore basically no reason to play because almost everything this game is relies on that.

I find myself actually having a lot of fun with this one more than most shockingly enough. This game masters the pacing issue that many RTS games lack. Its slower but not in a Northgard way (IE very small pop cap, disasters, ect)

The best way I can describe it is: Take star craft, right?

This game is a turtles paradise because the defensive structures are really good and there are no real third party objectives. You can capture additional resource points if you'd like but they arent truly necessary if you balance your production properly

Great gameplay, with an inspiring and motivating soundtrack to keep you trudging through real headscratching puzzles. The soundtrack itself is great to play while doing programming or very mentally intensive work.

The fishcake is yummy. | This has been an insane challenge but super fair, with minor exceptions*. If you like this sort of thing, this is EXACTLY the sort of thing you'll like.

Thank you, Zachtronics, for making such an amazing game. This is not a Sudoku or Sokoban where there is exactly one perfectly-logical solution to each puzzle. Instead, each player invents their own solutions -- and some can be more efficient than others, in multiple mutually-exclusive ways. As Zach Barth said in old interviews, SpaceChem is an example of ""design-based games, which present you with a goal, perfect information, and a set of combinable tools to achieve it... they're essentially asking you to 'invent' a solution to a problem instead of merely 'finding' the solution."" This kind of creative puzzle-solving is what I had imagined a STEM PhD program would be like (though it turns out PhDs are not really mostly about this; but that's a whole other story).

And... after a decade and a half, HOLY COW I finally beat it! Without hints**! I know many others have beat it before me, but it's still satisfying to know I've done something SpaceChem's designer Zach Barth has (according to old interviews) never done himself.

WOW has this ever been a long journey. These little molecules and waldos have accompanied me like a white whale through so many life stages. When SpaceChem came out in 2011, I started playing the game and enjoyed it a ton, but I got stuck and took a break. A few years later, I picked it up again as a distraction from grad school, but only reached the 4th or 5th world out of 9 -- before taking another (loooong) break. A decade later, after getting tenure, my treat to myself was to tackle SpaceChem seriously again... and now it's finally done -- with my kids staying up late to cheer as we beat the final boss.

Looking at the Steam-friends leaderboards, I'm also amused to see where my friends apparently quit playing. The quantum-physics PhD tunneled out in the 3rd world; the Twitch data scientist stopped streaming in the 5th; the software engineer and the IT manager suffered packet loss in the 6th. Somehow, I alone persevered to traverse the desolate worlds 7 through 9. Steam says I've spent 60ish hours on the game; I'd guess around 30 hours covered the first 6 worlds and the other 30 hours covered the last 3 worlds. Many of my solutions aren't optimized and beautiful (especially Don't Fear The Reaper; holy crap I made an ugly mess there) -- but they are mine, my own inventions, my hard-fought victories.

Once again, thank you to Zach and Zachtronics.

* The minor exceptions to fairness: (1) Every non-boss level tells you exactly how many molecules you need to make, but the boss-levels don't. It can be orders of magnitude harder to devise a solution that'll use up all molecules equally and produce an unending stream of hits, vs a good-enough solution that's unbalanced but just enough to beat the boss... yet you don't know how many hits each boss will take until you beat it. Most take around 3 hits -- but not all. (2) The game doesn't seem to allow multiple save slots for a level. If I try one solution and it doesn't QUITE work and I want to try another one, I have to get rid of my first solution and start the second... and if the second fails, I can't revert back to the first. I could take a screenshot of an initial solution, then remake it from scratch later if I need to, but aaargh! This is a small but extremely frustrating flaw in the game's interaction design. HOWEVER, I didn't realize until after beating the game that there's a dev-authorized ""community edition"" beta version which DOES allow multiple save slots per level. Look it up. Argh.

** ""I beat it, without hints"": Ok, technically, for the very last 2 boss levels I eventually looked up how many hits it takes to defeat each boss. See above -- I think this is unfair imperfect information. Besides, all the earlier bosses die after around 3 hits, but these two didn't die after 3... nor after 4... so I gave in and looked it up, because there's a big difference between ""incrementally tweak my initial solution to stretch from 3 hits to 5 or 6 hits"" vs ""start again from scratch to allow for 10 or 20 or 40 hits."" But I didn't look at anyone else's solutions, merely the number of hits required. | Great puzzle game, challenging and engaging! | I'm wondering why I'm playing this game, is it any different than going to github and submitting a feature? | This is a game made for people with massive brains."

Forget about furious running and shooting this is RPG Sam... Walk around the map and fight some random encounters. Gameplay is somewhat turn based and each action takes one turn. You can choose between shooting, swapping weapons or using an item. While in action phase you're able to dodge incoming enemies and bullets by going up or down. Music feels a bit melancholic but it's not the main con. What drives me insane are encounters which happen too frequently. On top of that gameplay gets repetitive very quickly as you choose similar strategy most of the time. At least you don't have to worry about ammo which basically is infinite for each weapon. Along the way you will experience some humorous dialogs and collect random keys to unlock next areas. Each stage have some sort of boss battle at the end. Basically game feels like an old dungeon crawlers with turn based strategy fights in the vein of RPG games. I think this game is not that serious. 5/10 still if you like Serious Sam you might wanna check it out and complete.

The art-style is grotesque, and the atmosphere is oppressing, but these things combined work well with the somewhat bleak world and characters.

Your not going to get 100s of hours of gameplay out of Scoregasm but it has enough levels and variety to keep you challenged for a while. There is quite a bit to unlock and explore.

Gorgeous graphics that pop out of the screen along, classic arcade style audio with some intense close quarter 'bullet hell' gameplay makes this a fun twin-stick shooter. If you can grab it at a good price its worth adding to the collection.

Ahh, Bullet Hell games, how much I love you... Or atleast love screaming at you. This game is more of a Bullet Hell Lite though, Still great fun but with none of the insane difficulty of a screen full of things really trying to kill you. 

Gameplay-wise, this game handles with all the grace and maneuverability of a twin-stick shooter... So, depending on how good you are at them great to middling. I always manage to lose my grip on one of the control sticks whenever I play, but I still manage to suvive somehow.

Graphically, the screen-shots speak for themselves. Bright, vibrant colours, varied enemies and stages, a third thing... I think this is one of the prettiest games that I own.

The music in this game matches the gameplay perfectly, so much so that I forget sometimes that the sound effects and the musical score are seperated.


I may be somewhat biased in this review, because I have always been a sucker for games like this, but I do fully recommend this game if you enjoy pretty colours with a laid-back feel... Well, as laid back as a Bullet Hell game can be.



A small bit of self promotion now, I have a Youtube channel where I do Let's Plays, and this game just happens to be one of the games that I have done on it. Who would've thought it? Anyway, if you want to see some gameplay footage of this game, please check out my Let's Play of it here:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frDdujwgOo8 | 二维的弹幕射击游戏。玩过东方、怒首领蜂、雷电等等系列的玩家上手应该没什么问题。

特点在于敌人只在一个限定的空间里刷新，你的火力可以指向任意的方向。有点像东方的符卡。也有擦弹奖励。
bomb 随时间自动恢复，恢复速度不算很慢。不过 bomb 作用范围仅限于自机周围一小圈。火力只有吃道具限时强化，没有永久增加。

难度跨度还是不错的。easy 应该随便都能打通，但即使是 easy 带的挑战也是很难的。insane 第8关就过不去了……永夜抄只能过 normal 的水平就是这样啦……

判定点不小。自机在屏幕中间，没有安定点可言，最重要的是密集的弹幕很容易让你找不到自机，不像东方那样即使看上去满屏只有子弹但至少你知道你在哪。

 | [u] GAMEPLAY [/u]
Thanks in no small part to the seminal 1980s classics like Robotron and Asteroids, we now have more twin-stick shooters than we can swing a twin-stick at. The principle is the same as it's always been: kill tons of enemies and avoid bazillions of missiles. Screens are confined by boundaries so the action is tight and restricted and incredibly intense. Its main gimmick, like Waves, is a slightly overpowered special attack which kills anything within a small radius around your ship.  Each level lasts about 40-60 seconds. Most enemies have one hit-point but with power-ups aplenty the usual sight is to see a monumental stream of bullets issuing forth from your ship and swarms of enemies exploding into smithereens. 

[u] PRESENTATION & DESIGN [/u]
The start-screen doubles as the level-select screen so moving your ship to the right scrolls through and uncovers the map of levels. Be warned though, it's a badly designed mess with no explanation or description given as to how navigating through the game actually works. Sound is a mixed bag as well; pumping, trance-like tunes get you into the zone but while in the menus the peculiar soundtrack coughs and splutters like a badly distorted fart. Graphics are fine, comparing similarly to the game's closest competitor, Mutant Storm Reloaded. The progression system in Scoregasm is disorientating to say the least. You get a score at the end but this gets lost to a broken online connection. However the high-score, best combo score and rank (S, A, B, C, D, E and F) for each individual level, if beaten, are stored and can be viewed on the stats page afterwards. 

[u] CONCLUSION [/u]
Scoregasm still remains one of the most intense Asteroids-inspired / twin-stick shoot ‘em ups of all time. Clearing tricky levels by a split second through skill and dexterity is always greeted with satisfying relief. Although it may not have the polish and class of a Geometry Wars it gets a lot more things right than other games of this ilk such as Bullet Candy, Gran Vitreous or Death Ray Manta. On the other hand it would benefit from giving the player the option to play individual levels (like in Mutant Storm Reloaded). The alternative Challenge levels are also too ridiculously tough for casual players. Still, the sheer enjoyment gained from the main part of the game is immense and largely makes up for these minor quibbles.

3/5

Definitely different from HOI4!  I enjoy that I can control almost every little detail of the gameplay without automating the units.  I just set the game speed to the second lowest and have the message settings set to pause the game when my units are attacked or when I win or lose a battle so I can react to each of the MANY events that require my immediate attention.  It definitely feels more like I'm making decisions and issuing orders from the strategic level all the way down to the tactical level.  Don't get me wrong - there is a STEEP learning curve!  I'm still finding mechanics that give me more options (underground resistance cells can spawn others in adjacent provences). All of your supplies, upgrades, reinforcements, production queue, and consumer goods are created from one pool of ""Industrial Capacity"" that needs constant attention and allocation.  You need to balance your leadership points between research, diplomacy, espionage, and officer training.  You have to decide what you will research with the finite pool of leadership points you have!  You will overlook critical research because it has a mundane name and description until you read and understand the stats boost it gives.  These might not be selling points if you're looking for a point-and-click, automated game that looks like it would be more comfortable on your phone.  It may not have the 3D animated sprites of infantry running in place at each other as they attack and defend 3D terrain.  It may not have railway guns, mulberry harbors, or supply depots.  It will challenge you.  It will make you feel stupid at times.  You will experience CRUSHING defeats - and you will come back and fight harder than before!  I whole-heartedly recommend this game for anyone who wants to spend months of their spare time slogging it out on the Eastern Front, or in the jungles and alpine plateaus of South America, or ANYWHERE.

also the music in this game is a lot better than it is in the second, much more industrial and gritty, plus no shitty korn-ripoff vocals talking about abortion and god. the audio design in general is just better imo... guns sound amazing. even the 9mm has a punchy and satisfying sound that never gets old, say what you want about tripwire but they know how to make guns sound, look, and FEEL great, red orchestra 2 is a great example of that. 

also, this game is not afraid to punish you with some hefty recoil, which is really nice and adds a solid challenge. i wouldn't call the gunplay ""realistic"" but it is close enough that it feels pretty damn good. the devs managed to make you feel weak at times, but also strong and badass as hell at other points. shooting the patriarch's limbs off with dual handcannons never gets old."

[h3]没有中文[/h3]
虽然剧情简单易懂，但没中文还是有点劝退。尤其是过场动画里的对话细节，Klei工作室，你们是觉得我们中国玩家都自带翻译器吗？
[h3]流程偏短以及老套[/h3]
动画确实好看，但剧情有点老套，典型的“你杀我老婆，我杀你全家”套路。普通模式通关大概2.5小时左右，虽然爽快但意犹未尽。刚进入状态，游戏就结束了，感觉像是吃了一顿快餐，还没吃饱就没了。
[h3]重复性较高[/h3]
砍完第100个小兵后，我已经分不清他们是谁了，反正都是“血包”。敌人种类和场景设计有点单一，后期容易审美疲劳。
[h3]操作门槛[/h3]
连击系统虽然爽，但对新手不太友好，手残党可能会被虐到自闭。特别是我明明按的是“砍人”，为什么角色在“跳舞”？手残党慎入！按错一个键，可能就从“华丽连招”变成“原地发呆”“罚站”。Boss战设计很棒，但某些Boss的难度曲线堪比过山车，前一秒还在虐菜，下一秒强度就上来了。

总结：
《Shank》是一款充满暴力美学的横版动作游戏，适合喜欢爽快战斗和复仇剧情的玩家。虽然有些小缺点，但整体体验依然值得一试。如果你是动作游戏爱好者，或者只是想找个发泄压力的方式，那么《Shank》绝对能满足你！

推荐人群：动作游戏爱好者、暴力美学爱好者、手速达人、有朋友的幸运儿。
慎入人群：手残党、剧情党、单身狗（双人模式警告）（单身狗默默流泪）。

Дайте мне немного времени, и после плюсов я обязательно вернусь к нему :)
+ Дизайн уровней. Конкретно 2-ого и 3-его Мира, несмотря на то что цель всей игры НЕ ОТВЛЕКАТЬСЯ на посторонние мельтешащие объекты, окружение достаточно проработано, и довольно атмосферно.
+ Музыка максимально средняя. Здесь нет никаких раскачивающих тебя треков (кроме босс-файтов) и все держится на (почти) одной и той же мелодии. Но напомню - в чем главная цель игры? Проходя по 40 раз уровень уже и не думаешь о ее существовании.
+ В игре есть несколько разнообразных боссов. Из них самый приятный 2-ой, у остальных ты больше проходишь сам уровень, нежели босса. 

И на этом плюсы у игры заканчиваются. Я старался выделить в них то что меня удивило в начале игры, но так как я (как и лишь 7% комьюнити) дошли до 3-его Мира, больше хорошего сказать мне нечего. Время минусов:
- Авто-раннер без права на ошибку. Эта игра считай похоронила себя еще на начале, ведь чем не приятное чувство когда ты дошел до середины/конца уровня, врезался в объект и начинаешь все заново :))) Ну, ты учтешь свою ошибку и таки пройдешь уровень? Что-же, это работает так до определенных уровней, 1-11, 1-12, 2-9, и боже бл*ть (за мат не извиняюсь) уровни с 3-9 по 3-11. Здесь уже играет роль не только запоминание паттерна, но и насколько долго хватит тебя и твоего терпения, из раза в раз проходя [Интересные] и [Реально увлекательные] уровни.
- Разных Миров 3, но объекты в них играют одну и ту же роль, просто имея другую текстуру. В 1-ом Мире ты еще не знал чего ждать от игры, и все было в новинку, но потом у разработчиков кончилась фантазия. Удивительно как с таким ""разнообразием"" игру растянули на целых 33 уровня (не считая боссов)
- Кто тот гений из разработчиков, что решил добавить уровень 1-11 не в соответствующий его уровню сложности Мир? Если верить достоверности процентажа ачивок (на случай, если они не были сломаны долгое время) его прошло лишь 11% игроков. Таким образом большая часть комьюнити (89%) просто напросто отсеялась от игры, так и не осилив его. Все эти 3к положительных отзывов это те самые 11%? Или большая часть оценила лишь 1-ый Мир, который слабее чем последующие во всех смыслах?
- Ну и на сладкое - бонусные ретро уровни. Сами по себе они простые, но единственная цель их существования - получение Идеального счета на уровне. Да, вот только...если ты пропустишь хотя-бы один слиток, перепроходи оригинальный уровень заново, просто чтобы иметь еще одну попытку. Что мешало отделить их, упростив и так непростую задачу тем трем калекам что решили пройти все 33 испытания на Идеально - загадка...

Игра не дает изначально знать о себе как о максимально сложной, карающей и жесткой, but here we are - игру прошло меньше 4% игроков (я в их числе, к счастью) а большая ее часть застряла на 1-ом Мире. Хорошая работа :) | Играл я как-то в Super Meat Boy.. И меня очень привлёк Командир Видео, поэтому я решил поиграть в BIT.TRIP RUNNER.

Игра замечательная! Очень весёлая, с хорошей графикой и замечательной музыкой! Может быть для нынешнего времени кому-то может показаться скучной, но для тех годов это был пик, да и я в принципе ни разу ни заскучал.

[b] С целью просто поиграть: [/b]
Рекомендую всем, уверен вам всем очень понравится! Хорошая игра на вечер!

[b] С целью получить все достижения: [/b]
Если у вас железные нервы - желаю вам удачи. [u] Слабонервным я не рекомендую пытаться проходить игру полностью, я серьёзно. [/u] Куча сложных уровней и ретро челленджи будут заставлять вас ненавидеть эту игру. Ретро челлендж 3-2 вы будете проклинать из-за факта присутствия в нём безумного тайминга.
Я прошёл игру полностью на 100%, и на получении последнего достижения был очень измучен. Однако это не меняет моё отношение к игре - я всё ещё считаю её достаточно хорошей.

[b] Дополнение: [/b]
С момента выхода BIT.TRIP RERUNNER я больше рекомендую вам пойти поиграть в именно в RERUNNER, потому что он гораздо лучше обычного BIT.TRIP RUNNER во всех аспектах.
Но если вы хотите купить игру для ностальгической атмосферы - покупайте это!

You play as a ball, or sphere, as the game describes it, and you have to use your environment to complete a large collection of puzzles. Some levels allow you to flip gravity, to brake, to sprint or dash, some levels even have pinball paddles for you to control, or contraptions for you to ride. There's tons of obstacles to discover, and in some cases, use to your advantage.

Looking at the art style, I had an inkling who developed the game, and lo and behold, I was correct. The same person who created the Knytt series, created this, and it shows with how much passion was poured into it.

Если вы знаете как устроен основной режим в The Ship, то вам будет не сложно освоиться здесь. Тот же принцип, те же карты. Единственное отличие - сюжетная подача. Здесь есть то объяснение, которого не хватало мультиплеерной игре. Почему вы на корабле? Почему должны убивать друг друга?

Confesso que este foi o único motivo para baixar esse jogo inicialmente, mas ao jogar, percebi que o game é [b]incrível![/b], É muito divertido, principalmente com amigos, tem um bom humor e gráficos bons no estilo [i]cartoon[/i] para um jogo de 2012, conta com 3 modos de jogo, no mesmo estilo de Team Deathmatch e Tower Defense, uma boa personalização de personagem, e mesmo usando apenas os personagens que já vêm liberados no jogo, é possível ter partidas bem equilibradas, por isso não o considero como [i]Pay to Win[/i], resumindo, o jogo é muito bom, [b]o motivo de eu não recomendar? bem, é algo triste...[/b]

Ви коли-небудь хотіли пограти щось в епоху чистого, я маю на увазі без магічних штук, середньовіччя? Якщо так, то ця гра саме те, що потрібно. Тут є досить великий відкритий світ, гра не заганяє в рамки, ви можете робити все що спаде на думку і бути будь-ким: розбійником, найманцем, торговцем, лордом або кинути виклик усім і стати володарем власного королівства, а згодом і королем усієї Кальрадії. З часом гра починає набридати, тоді на сцену виходять модифікації, це є ще одним великим плюсом. У вас є можливість перетворити гру на будь-що, від сонячного ""Дикого заходу"" і моторошних земель ""Володаря перснів"", до космічних просторів із всесвіту ""Зоряних війн"".

Ця гра сильно затягує, тому якщо вона вам сподобається, то з великою ймовірністю у перші дні буде награно кілька десятків годин. Серйозно, мені було важко з неї вийти, постійно в голові складав план, наприклад, ось завершу цей квест і виходжу, а в цей момент на карті з'являлися кілька лутерів і я такий ""перемагаю їх і на сьогодні досить"", але потім все затяглося на кшталт зроблю це, зроблю то, продам то, знищу тих, бах і замок в осаді... Дивлюся, а надворі вже ніч і треба лягати спати. Спочатку я взагалі думав зайти побігати трохи, зробити кілька знятків і вийти. І я набігав аж 130 годин за кілька тижнів.

Дивлячись на негативні рецензії, то 75% з них є просто через те, що існує M&B Warband, як на мене це не зовсім справедливо, але я розумію їх, він дійсно краще, як з технічного стану так і візуально, і так, я [b]РЕКОМЕНДУЮ[/b] починати з Warband, але не слід забувати, що оригінальний M&B це по суті його фундамент і обзивати його лохом через те, що у нього є менший брат, який набагато кращий у всьому, я не можу.

Українізатора для M&B на жаль немає, але в цій ситуації я не впевнений, чи він взагалі потрібен, як я писав вище, краще починати з Warband, Українізатор для якого є.

[h1]7 полонених королів з 10[/h1] | Este juego fue una grata sorpresa, las batallas son de lo más entretenidas, aunque en general el ritmo del juego es bastante repetitivo, las mismas misiones/objetivos, pero el deseo de expandirte y aumentar el número de tu ejercito resulta muy adictivo por alguna razón. Juegas un rato con el creador de personaje y te embarcas en tu aventura para subir de nivel tus habilidades en un mapa amplio con una banda sonora y gráficos más que decentes en donde deberás ganarte la confianza de los nobles para conseguir aliados, o simplemente ser un rebelde y esclavizar aldeanos por tu cuenta, el juego te da la libertad de decidir que hacer en su mundo, todo con el fin de aniquilar ejércitos completos hasta más no poder.

Aunque estés haciendo lo mismo todo el rato, ni te darás cuenta cuando lleves tus 30-50 horas, hay variedad de armas y castillos que asediar, así como estrategias a aplicar, aunque en ese aspecto esperaba más comandos pero quedé satisfecho. Algo negativo a mi gusto sería que no hay un límite en este juego al que puedas llegar, o alguna historia que pueda marcar un final, aún así lo recomiendo, resulta en una experiencia medieval muy divertida si te gustan este tipo de juegos, la jugabilidad se logra sentir cómoda aún con sus años.

PD. Busquen en las guías algún parche en español (como siempre), y ni se les ocurra subir la dificultad de la IA o entrarán en un bucle infinito en donde se terminarán aburriendo/agotando como fue mi caso xd. | Mount & Blade – це унікальна серія, яка втілює мрію кожного гравця про свободу у відкритому середньовічному світі. Розроблена турецькою студією TaleWorlds Entertainment, гра стала справжнім подарунком для любителів стратегій, ролевих ігор та епічних битв. Незважаючи на відсутність глянцю великих ААА-проєктів, Mount & Blade захоплює своєю глибиною та неповторним шармом.

Свобода вибору
Однією з найбільших переваг Mount & Blade є повна свобода дій. Ви починаєте як невідомий мандрівник і можете стати ким завгодно: найманцем, торговцем, лордом чи навіть королем власного королівства. Гравець має змогу самостійно вирішувати, як писати свою історію в світі Калрадії – фентезійного середньовічного континенту, наповненого політичними інтригами, війнами та нескінченними можливостями.

Бойова система
Mount & Blade відома своєю реалістичною та динамічною бойовою системою. Битви відбуваються в реальному часі, і від вашої майстерності залежить результат кожного поєдинку. Можливість брати участь у масштабних битвах, керувати загоном чи навіть стати героєм, який змінить хід війни, дарує незабутні враження. Ви відчуєте всю вагу меча, точність стріл і потужність кавалерійської атаки.

Стратегічні елементи
Крім бойових аспектів, Mount & Blade пропонує широкий спектр стратегічних можливостей. Ви можете формувати власну армію, керувати ресурсами, будувати економічні ланцюжки та укладати дипломатичні угоди. Захоплення міст і замків, боротьба за політичний вплив та управління підданими додають глибини ігровому процесу.

Атмосфера та світ
Калрадія – це світ, сповнений життя, історій і конфліктів. Різні фракції, культури та політичні амбіції створюють динамічне середовище, де кожна дія гравця впливає на подальший розвиток подій. Атмосфера середньовіччя відчувається у всьому: від музичного супроводу до деталей одягу та архітектури.

Особливості серії
Mount & Blade: Warband – вершина класичної серії, яка додала мультиплеєр і розширила можливості для створення власного королівства.
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord – довгоочікуване продовження, яке зберегло дух оригіналу, але вивело графіку, механіку та масштабність гри на новий рівень.
Графіка та технічні аспекти
Хоча графіка Mount & Blade не є найсильнішою стороною серії, це з лишком компенсується глибоким геймплеєм і багатством можливостей. Своєрідна естетика додає шарму та допомагає зосередитися на головному – на грі.

Модифікації – душа Mount & Blade
Окремої уваги заслуговують моди. Спільнота фанатів створила величезну кількість модифікацій, які додають нові фракції, епохи та навіть змінюють сеттинг гри. Хочете опинитися у Середзем’ї з ""Володаря перснів"" чи перенестися у світ вікінгів? Завдяки модам це можливо.

Загальне враження
Mount & Blade – це гра, яка дає вам більше, ніж ви очікуєте. Вона не хапає зірок із неба у графіці чи постановці, але її глибина, свобода та реалістичність роблять її однією з найкращих у своєму жанрі. Це проєкт для тих, хто любить виклики, стратегії та хоче творити власну історію у світі середньовіччя.

Оцінка: 9/10
Mount & Blade – це гра для душі, яка вимагає часу, але нагороджує незабутніми враженнями. | ilk m&b.

Eğer Mount & Blade serisini seviyorsanız ve savaş meydanlarında kılıç yerine barut kokusu duymak istiyorsanız, With Fire & Sword kesinlikle ilginizi çekecek bir oyun! Klasik Mount & Blade mekaniklerini korurken, bu sefer tarihi tüfekler, tabancalar ve el bombaları gibi yeni silahları da savaş alanına taşıyor.

Öncelikle, oyunun geçtiği 17. yüzyıl Doğu Avrupa atmosferi gerçekten etkileyici. Lehistan, Kazaklar, Osmanlılar, Moskova Çarlığı ve İsveç gibi o dönemin büyük güçleri arasında savaşmak, tarih meraklıları için tam bir ziyafet. Bu dönemin kaotik ortamında paralı asker olarak güç kazanabilir, kendi ordunuzu kurabilir ve haritada siyasi dengeleri değiştirebilirsiniz.

Silahlar ve savaş mekanikleri klasik Mount & Blade formülüne harika bir yenilik getiriyor. Tüfek ve tabanca kullanımı savaşlara farklı bir strateji katıyor; düşmanlarınıza uzaktan ateş açabilir, sonra kılıcınızı çekip yakın dövüşe girebilirsiniz. Özellikle kaleleri savunmak ya da fethetmek, barutlu silahlarla daha kaotik ve heyecan verici bir hale geliyor.

Ek olarak, ticaret, görevler ve diplomasi seçenekleri genişletilmiş. Oyunda farklı fraksiyonlarla ilişkiler kurabilir, tüccarlık yaparak zenginleşebilir ya da paralı asker olarak savaşlardan kâr elde edebilirsiniz. Ayrıca, geliştirilmiş hikâye odaklı görevler ve tarihi karakterlerle etkileşimler, oyunun sürükleyiciliğini artırıyor.

Tabii ki, grafikler ve oynanış modern Mount & Blade oyunları kadar gelişmiş değil ama bu oyunun sunduğu tarihi atmosfer ve özgürlük hissi, her şeyi telafi ediyor. Eğer tarih, savaş stratejisi ve özgür oynanıştan hoşlanıyorsanız, With Fire & Sword kesinlikle denemeniz gereken bir yapım! | можно резать крымских татар под руководством Богдана Хмельницкого, рекомендую | Şahane bir oyun anlamam uzun sürdü ama olsun.Warban'dı da alıp oynayacağım,oynayın. | Игра 10/10, могу выделить несколько основных плюсов

Правды ради стоит сказать, что на любой из доступных карт существует разные режимы игры, которые вовсе меняют жанр игры на мультиплеерную перестрелку. Кстати, кампании здесь нет вовсе, лишь набор из карт, ничем кроме сеттинга не связанных. Самой собой сюжета тоже нет (как оказалось, он тут не нужен). Настоящее удовольствие получаешь благодаря тому, что здесь каждый бой ощущается очень близко, как если бы это был шутер, а не tbs. Достигается это благодаря тому, что ваши защитные единицы - не бездушные башни, а реальные солдаты, отличающиеся друг от друга по классу и цене, плюс каждый из них имеет имя и уникальный внешний вид, обалденный психологический эффект. После прохождения нескольких первых карт, игра показывает зубы, вот тут-то и возникает потребность в глубоком анализе текущей карты и правильном подборе нужных членов команды. Уникальный визуальный стиль игры (все из кубов) сложно не узнать, думаю он понравится большинству, ибо сделан приятно. Музыкальные подобраны такие, чтобы поддерживать динамику боя.

LoLとか、その辺が好きな人には良いんじゃないかな。
そこまで奥が深くはないけど。セールで買うなら・・・　程度。 | Cubemen is a strategy tower defense game, where you and your army of cubes defend the enemy forces from taking over you base.
I had 100+ hours on my phone, so I have experience beyond Steam.

Pros:
-Easy gameplay
-Addictive
-Great soundtrack
-Easy controls
-Custom  skins for cubes and levels
-Hilarious
-Fairly Quick gameplay
-Different gamemodes
-Easy to develop strategies
Cons:
-Not many people play it anymore
-Singleplayer can get pretty boring after a while
- no storymode (but the second game has one)
- When you develop a strategy, if becomes repetive and boring.

I will reccomend this game, but I'd reccomend you either gift or get your friends to buy it as well so you can 
play together so it won't get as boring as quick. But if your looking for a fungame to last you a couple days, I'd also reccomend it.
7.5/10 | Could not find a reason to like this game. It is a simple tower defense game, without a theme or story. Tried three times to get into this game, but there was just nothing there for me to enjoy. It was so bland! Maybe not my type of game.

Someone spent a lot of time making this very polished, decent sound effects, and it has a three-dimensional appearance, so it may appeal to fans of the TD-style, at discount. Maybe this is a fun game to play head-to-head?

Technically, I played this on ubuntu 18.10 with radeon mesa graphic drivers. Cubemen uses the Unity game engine."

Mais um joguinho de carrinhos de rádio controle, mas muito divertido e cheio de referências à outros jogos, personagens de desenhos animados e personagens da vida real, como o Senna. A mecânica do jogo já é conhecida e muito parecida com WRC Powerslide: Você controla a direção do carrinho com o analógico e acelera sem parar. Diferentemente do WRC, você não usa somente esquerda/direita, mas aponta na direção que quer que o carro siga e isso vai criar algumas estranheza no começo, mas logo você se acostuma. O fator diversão é alto, principalmente se conseguir jogar online com alguns amigos. Vi no fórum que algumas pessoas reclamam de não conseguir jogar online, algo que ainda não testei, então não posso opinar. A graça do jogo está em disputar cada centímetro de curva com os adversários e tocá-los significa perder muita velocidade e tempo. Aleatoriamente surgirão na pista dinheiro e nitro, que salvarão seu couro em algumas situações.

Cara, as customizações... As referências...
Ele tem um editor de pistas. Precisa dizer algo mais? Nele já vem pistas do Portal 2, Tem Fortress 2, Fruit Ninja e muitas outras. Os carrinhos são um show à parte com ônibus escolares, ambulâncias, formula 1 e outros bólidos igualmente interessantes e todos com pinturas muito engraçadas como o furgão que pode ser pintado como o furgão do Scooby Doo ou das Tartarugas Ninjas. Detalhes como a pintura da Williams do Formula 1 de Senna, que vem com o ano da sua morte estampado: ""94"". Isso realmente me encantou.

GRÁFICOS:
Bons, muito bons. Detalhes que muita gente não percebe como uma bola de feno rolando na pista da cidade fantasma (velho oeste) que atrapalha os corredores, por exemplo. Poças dágua, rampas, tem de tudo. 9/10

SOM:
Aceitável. Nada que faça você odiar o jogo. Músicas que condizem com o ambiente. 6/10

JOGABILIDADE:
Uma vez que se acostume com os controles, nada de errado, a não ser pequenos bugs quando tem grandes subidas ou decidas. Acontece de às vezes você bater em algo invisível, mas é raro. 7/10

DIVERSÃO:
Garantida! Só poderia ser mais divertido ainda se houvessem mais power-ups como WRC Powerslide. O jogo vive de Nitros e Dinheiro, mais nada. Ainda assim, diversão garantida. 9/10

Fiquei jogando direto por 3 horas e ainda tenho vontade de jogar. | ☺ Easy to play.
☺ Lovely visuals.
☺ Brilliantly realised Portal and Team Fortress 2 maps.

☹ Unchallenging.
☹ Wonky physics.
☹ Drunk AI Drivers.

(Note: This game was played with a controller).

Mini Motor Racing EVO is a casual top down racer suitable for most ages, with easy to grasp controls and an aesthetic that greatly reminds me of playing with toy cars as a youngster.

While there is a decent selection of maps (and most notably the Portal and Team Fortress 2 maps are brilliantly realised), they quickly become repetitive as you play them again and again through the championships - in forward, reverse and with the camera on a slightly different angle (which is a surprisingly clever way of making the same track play a little differently). There is also an ingame editor linked to the Steam Workshop to create, share and download other tracks which is very simple to do.

While enjoyable to zip around the tracks and drift around corners, the AI opposition rarely put up any challenge at all (the exception being a couple of maps where you could do with a speed upgrade, that is easily passed the moment you have acquired it or a higher top speed vehicle). It also appears the AI Drivers have been drinking...while it's nice that they don't always perform the perfect lap, they will frequently slam into corners or boost directly into a wall.

The physics in the game can cause frustration, as you slap to a halt after performing a jump or snag on a slightly uphill piece of track.  There is also an oddity that before a race gets underway you get a glimpse of the tablet UI for the game, but that doesn't impact the experience in any meaningful way.

At the time of writing, there were no active multiplayer servers.

It's very hard to recommend Mini Motor Racing EVO except for the extremely casual gamer who's unfamiliar with racing titles and just wants a little fun zipping around a track. | If you can ignore the ease in which your little mini motor racing car can be spun out by competitors (and the massive clusters that this causes), and if you can get over the questional physics in a(n admittedly) minority of maps, then this game is a fantastic racer.

If you grab it while it's on sale for about $2.50, then the game is a fantastic addition to a gaming library. | Mini Motor Racing EVO has really become a very entertaining racing game.
It's a pleasure to race on the various tracks and the boost provides great help on the track.
The career mode is nicely expanded and every vehicle is worth re-challenging the racecourses!

Check out some gameplay here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQRm5M_G_kM | This is a cute little racer, reminiscent of the Amiga racer All Terrain Racing, that will hit both your pleasure and frustration buttons.  The two major frustrating elements are the collisions that almost always favour the AI racers, and also the lack of progress syncing in between races.  You'd better quit and restart on your own every few races to save your races and your money, because a game or a system crash will obliterate any progress from that session.

As for the game itself, it is a satisfying combination of good driving, tactics, and upgrades that will see you to the finish line.  You'll need more than just a couple of afternoons to make it to the end, and every time you make it past that one difficult course, it feels just great.  A worthwhile purchase if you like small, classic racers."
76561197999259031,1303990,Mini Motor Racing X,0.5666666666666667,"Indie, Racing",1,"Start with Racing then get the Touring car after completing the Standard Championship. You'll cruise to the finish even on Hard. All you have to do is use Nitro off the starting block and the acceleration and handling will take care of the rest. If you don't, the whole pack will body you and you'll get stuck everywhere. It seems like only the leader really gets the bonus Nitro that spawns on the track.

I liked the different camera views, I mostly did top down but switched to behind view for the last series. I didn't like the player icon that hovers over the car in this view, pretty annoying. 

Races are basically 50 seconds. The handful of maps are nice, and I don't mind going in reverse, but at some point it starts to feel repetitive when the difficulty never gets any harder. At the same time, going for 100% didn't take ages. 

I think the only difference between this and Evo might be the weapons mode. I did just enough to get an achievement, otherwise I ignored it completely. Same with MP, you get splitscreen but the achievements are only for matchmaking.

Definitely play on Hard to keep the heart-rate up. Casual cartoon racing when the mood strikes."

Peek of Ubisoft gaming. | Uno de los mejores juegos de Rayman. Muy divertido, rápido, con música excelente y un artstyle bellísimo. Las carreras con los cofres son la mejor parte del juego para mí. Aunque el final fue algo anticlimático, eso sí. Ni siquiera hay jefe final. También, los desbloqueables dejan un poco que desear. Casi todos los personajes desbloqueables son diminutos. Solo hay 2 variaciones de Rayman y de Globox. Desearía que hubiera más (por suerte esto en Legends se arregló). En lo técnico, también desearía que tuviera cloud save de Steam (muy raro que no tenga).
Un juego tan bueno que hasta los niveles de agua son divertidos. | Eu joguei muito esse jogo quando pequeno, ele ainda continua tão bom quanto eu lembrava. Consegue ser desafiador e interessante mesmo com o design infantil, jogar com amigos deixa o jogo mais engraçado do que nunca, é um prazer jogar depois de tantos anos. | Rayman Origins is a charming and beautifully animated platformer that brings back the classic charm of the Rayman series while adding modern improvements. The levels are well-designed, offering a great mix of challenge and fun, with fantastic visuals and music that complement the playful atmosphere. The game’s co-op mode makes it even more enjoyable, letting you team up with friends for some chaotic fun. It’s a classic that still holds up today.

What I liked:
✔️ Gorgeous hand-drawn art style and fluid animations
✔️ Fun and challenging platforming that keeps you engaged
✔️ Great soundtrack that enhances the experience
✔️ Co-op mode adds extra fun and replayability
✔️ Creative levels and hidden secrets to discover

76561197999259031,6900,Hitman: Codename 47,0.0,Action,0,"I think Hitman 47 is a classic in stealth games. The game that made a breakthrough in the genre. And everyone should try this part to understand the essence of the Hitman game. Here, the pith of the game is cautious planning and perfect execution of each mission, which instantly reminded me of the fabulous game SWAT 3.

The game takes us to three diverse parts of the world - we begin  in Hong Kong, at that point move to the Colombian jungle, to end the game in Europe. The game consists of 12 missions. Before starting each of them, we receive comprehensive review materials, taking into account primarily the mission objectives, tactical tips, character descriptions with video recordings, maps of the area where we will carry out the action and a detailed list of available equipment, along with prices. As in life, nothing is free - we get money for completing the mission, but we will have to pay for the equipment from our own pocket. At this stage we decide what weapon to take, how much ammunition to buy for it, etc. It may not be an impressive arsenal, but it has everything you need to complete the task - pistols, silencers, a sniper rifle, machine guns for larger events, a nylon cord around the neck, a bomb with a detonator if necessary, etc. Similarly, we are not able to hide a larger toy such as a Kalashnikov in the bosom of a tasteful suit, which at certain moments in the game completely excludes its possession.

Interestingly, our assignments are not constrained to killing the ""object"" - regularly you have got to carry out other orders, the usage of which can be more troublesome than basically disposing of another awful fellow. Exceptionally frequently, it includes maintaining watchfulness, taking an item from the scene of action or coordinating doubt at other individuals. Be that as it may, they don't tell us HOW to do it - and at this point we come to the magnificence of this game - the capacity to plan the course of the mission yourself and the joy of finding ideal arrangements.

What I acknowledged the foremost was the best character animations I`ve seen for year 2000. They moved easily and naturally, characters passing by turn their heads looking at us all the time, guards on duty extend from time to time etc. It may sound a bit grotesque, but the skeletal models of cadavers made the greatest impression on me. A shot opponent falls defenselessly down the stairs, a dead body lying on the ground treated with an extra burst from a heavier weapon moves with a tremble pushed by the force of bullets, the bodies we drag twist their limbs, catching on the obstacles they encounter.

At first, i myself reacted with a frown of dissatisfaction, but after a while, intrigued by the game, I gritted my teeth and tried, attempted, tried until i succeeded. I ensure that the satisfaction of completing a assignment ""in one go"" is much greater than securely completing a mission thanks to the ""save"" option piece by piece. This is often also part of the magnificence of this game - the first few attempts are about investigating the territory, the behavior of the opponent, finding unused conceivable outcomes of strategic moves, more and more experience until we reach the point when already know HOW to do everything - at that point all that is left for full victory is consistency, perfect timing of all actions, and as usual - a stroke of good fortune.

In conclusion.
Hitman Codename 47 is one of those games that you simply can play despite its age. It`s an inventive take on the stealth genre which has brought forth an notorious and long running series that has only gotten way better and better with time. It has its few imperfections, for the most part due to its age. Its still a fun time, but it is admittedly an extremely dated game in the event that you`ve played later entries. But they don`t truly affect the quality of the gameplay so, you'll be able to get a lot of delight from playing the first Hitman.

Incredible climate, wonderful design for its time, possibility of numerous combinations, cinematic embeds and a astounding ending have set this game in a place of honor in my collection.
8.4/10 | An essential game to the Hitman franchise, but many of the levels truly do need a guide and multiple rage inducing attempts. Every now and then, you can see glimpses of the future Hitman games, but they are too few to make this game a net positive. It is somewhat short however, so you can get through it in not too long. | While i enjoyed my time playing it and i managed to beat it, the game is very dated and unfair in terms of difficulty due to not  having the ability to save while on missions. I can only recommended to super fans of the hitman franchise. Everyone else should stay away from it because you will probably not have a good time.
6/10 | As a kid I always skipped this game and went straight to Contracts & Blood Money, now I finally played it fully for the first time, I think it might have become my favorite, or at least just as liked as Blood Money & the reboots, I wish I could forget this game and be able to experience the levels for the first time again, BECAUSE IT'S SO GOOD!!! It will forever have a special place in my heart now. :)

The levels are VERY varied, so varied in fact that I would never expect it from this game, while some levels are tiny, even cozy, some levels are GIANT, maybe too giant for their own good at some moments, but nothing that would make me like this game less.
There are a few pretty big difficulty spikes if you're playing for the first time and don't know what to do, the first of which (Lee Hong Assassination) probably turned a lot of players away from this game sadly, but if you actually figure out a strategy and what to do, it's totally awesome, it was just the right amount of challenging for me and actually might have become one of my favorite missions + the highlights of this game are just so good they're out of this world good. (Traditions Of The Trade & The Setup my beloved).

ALAM, ALAM, WE HAVE A SITUATION, HE'S PACKING!!! | Nowadays this game is garbage, but.... There are many memories in this game. The beginning of the hitman story. With this game you can see how much games have changed over the years

76561197999259031,211600,Thief™ Gold,0.0,"Action, Simulation",0,"Что можно сказать о Thief за два с половиной десятилетия? Это одна из лучших игр на то время когда-либо созданных. Мне очень понравилась игра, даже не смотря на корявое управление, иногда не понятные механики и немного все по деревянному, но на это я даже внимание не обращал. Я пришел к Thief очень поздно, но как говорится, лучше сейчас, чем никогда. 

Игра нам рассказывает о истории Гаррета, циничного мастера-вора в фантастическом средневековом городе, населенном религиозными фанатиками, коррумпированными законодателями и развратными богачами. Цель Гаррета в этом беспощадном мире, по факту просто остаться в живых. Его метод - это  красть у этих фанатиков и законодателей. 

То, что здесь можно увидеть, так это не просто какая-то стелс-игра - здесь можно увидеть как впервые использовали освещение и звук в качестве игровой механики, а так же всеми называемый IMMERSIVE SIM. Стелс на самом деле работает и довольно точно, благодаря маленькому драгоценному камню рядом с нашей полосой здоровья, которая сообщает нам, насколько мы подвержены свету в любой момент. Говоря о immersive sim, в Thief может не быть заклинаний и способностей для изучения, но можно подходить к ситуациям по-разному в зависимости от используемого оружия и прочего инвентаря, в основном решая, какой путь через уровень лучше всего выбрать. Это все еще игра-стелс, в которой бой настоятельно не приветствуется. Можно пройти с боем, скорее всего) и даже наловчится, но все файты довольно неотзывчивы. Бои на мечах максимально напряженные. Есть направленные атаки, реактивные парирования, оружие может даже столкнуться с оружием противника, если вы оба атакуете одновременно, но все равно это выглядит максимально вяло и нелепо.

Дизайн уровней выглядит прекрасно. Здесь много повествования об окружающей среде, подкрепленного потрясающим художественным дизайном. Это сеттинг в стиле стимпанк/фэнтези, но в холодной средневековой архитектурой, все это заставляет выглядеть и ощущаться очень приземленным и суровым. Уровни также щедрые по размеру и довольно открытые, что делает поиск оптимального маршрута интересным испытанием сам по себе, и не только когда ищешь секреты и добычу, чтобы продать ее между миссиями за большее снаряжение. 

В любом случае рекомендую этого деда стелса. Вор меня впечатляет, а механика скрытности мне понравилась. Игра очень увлекательна и с каждым уровнем становится все интересней и интересней проходить уровни и все это дополняет атмосфера и дизайн уровней, а так же олдовый звук.
9/10

 | Хорошая стелс-игра. В этой части огромное количество минусов, большую часть из которых к счастью исправили в следующей части игры. Боевка - это полнейший п****ц как по мне. Понятное дело, главный герой (Гарретт) является вором, а собственно он будет действовать не на силу, а на скрытность, будет вести не самые лучшие атаки мечом, но ёмае, я могу спокойно обычной дубинкой захeрачить бедолагу на охраннике или хаммерита БАМ-БАМ-БАМ по башке; охрана и хаммериты до середины игры только и делают, что меееееееееееедленно атакуют с доооооооолгоооой анимацией, ну или ХОБА, НЫЫЫАААААА В ХАРЮ С МОЛОТА ОДНОЙ РУКОЙ быстрой анимацией - это конечно не очень. Просто забудьте про боевку, делайте всё скрытно и без убийств, ведь дубинка - ваш верный друг на всю игру, НО вот когда вы встретите ""зараженных"" хаммеритов, то тут боевка раскрывается на полную; берите меч и начинайте настоящую дуэль хотя бы с одним из представителей этой жути, т.к. эти ребята могут надавать нexyeвeнньких люлей, а от их фраз, внешнего вида и быстрой скорости бега и атак одни мурашки по коже. Что могу сказать хорошего о игре: похвальная мрачная атмосфера локаций с мрачным эмбиентом, приятный голос Гарретта и шикарные катсцены даже по современным меркам. В игре полно приятных деталей по типу: если тело оглушенного человека бросить в воду, то он тупо задохнётся и задание ""закончить уровень без убийств"" будет провален, или например водяная стрела не только тушит огонь, но и убирает следы от крови, или ещё то, что врага можно буквально напугать, если резко выйти к нему из-за угла. Первая вышедшая стелс-игра на ПК, первая игра на движке Dark Engine, а столько приятных мелочей и контента, так ответственно отнеслись к игре. Худшее, что можно было сделать с этой игрой - добавить подземные уровни/уровни с мертвецами. Игра на 20+ часов, а то и более, в игре 16/17 уровней. Как я заметил, в зависимости от сложности меняются только требования к завершению уровня: чем выше сложность, тем более нужно исследовать, тщательно всё обчищать, собсна найти драгоценностей побольше. Не советую стремится к высокому уровню сложности, ведь нахождение каких-либо предметов могут быть той ещё занозой в заднице. Первый Thief выдался очень добротной для своего времени, но сейчас в это тяжело играть из-за затянутых и запутанных уровней, например: уровни, в которых будет присутствовать нежить - это самое скучное в игре, весь стелс пропадает и из-за чего я очень хотел дропнуть игру даже под конец. Были уровни, без которых мне не удалось пройти без гайдов, потому что я не нашёл предмет для задания в кромешной темноте, либо не нашёл проход дальше. Зато здесь никто не ведёт тебя за руку, идея с нарисованной от руки картой Гарретом интересная, а также нужно читать записи, чтобы решить какую-то задачу, хотя эти записи порой могут запутать. Очень неплохая игра, но как по мне на один раз. Оценка: 6,8/10 | Amazing stealth game.
Still great to play even though it is ancient.
Install T fix or Tafferpatcher to have a better experience on modern systems.
10/10 | [h1] Классика, которая все еще держит планку  [/h1]

Наконец пройдя первую часть, могу с уверенностью сказать: Thief Gold отлично играется даже сегодня, несмотря на свой возраст. Геймплей — это настоящая находка: механика скрытности, свобода действий и напряжение от каждого шага по-прежнему захватывают.

Особое восхищение вызывают размеры и проработка уровней. В современных играх локации редко дотягивают до такого уровня дизайна. Да, они не изобилуют мелкими деталями, но именно их лаконичность создает необходимую атмосферу: темный, загадочный мир, который хочется исследовать.

Thief Gold — это игра, которая не стареет, а продолжает вдохновлять своим подходом к дизайну и геймплею. Если вы еще не пробовали, самое время окунуться в этот шедевр. | One of my defining games. The 9 hours played does not reflect my real ingame playtime.
The game itself is perfect, genre defining, the atmosphere can reach the bones. Goosebumps.

It's old, but with the must have mods/fixes it is totally enjoyable. The caveat is, that these tools should be included by default if it is sold in a webshop. They should write a script with options to download and apply these fixes, to be able to play. Because just the original game itself can be hard to even run on modern systems.

Otherwise the game itself is remarkable."

Overview: ORION: Prelude is a first-person shooter and survival game developed by Spiral Game Studios. Set in a sci-fi universe, the game offers players the chance to fight off waves of enemies, mine for resources, and explore alien landscapes. As the ""Prelude"" in the title suggests, this is part of a larger series that focuses on cooperative survival and exploration. Players can engage in solo or multiplayer modes, with the game offering various environments and enemies to battle.

Gameplay: At its core, ORION: Prelude is a mix of survival, exploration, and action. The game features dynamic combat, where players fight off hordes of enemies with a variety of weapons and tools. Players can also mine resources to improve their weapons, build turrets, and upgrade their defenses.

The game supports both solo and multiplayer modes, with the co-op experience being a major highlight. In multiplayer, players can team up to face increasingly difficult waves of enemies. This cooperative play adds a layer of strategy, as players need to work together to survive the onslaught.

The combat itself is relatively standard for a first-person shooter, with a variety of weapons available, including guns, explosives, and melee tools. However, the AI can sometimes feel lackluster, and the enemy design doesn’t offer much variety or challenge in the long run.

Graphics and Performance: ORION: Prelude features fairly basic graphics for a modern first-person shooter. The environments are passable but not particularly impressive, with alien landscapes that can feel repetitive. The textures and character models are simple, and while they’re functional, they don't stand out visually. The game’s visual style is somewhat dated, even by the standards of games released around its time.

In terms of performance, ORION: Prelude runs decently on most systems, but it can struggle with optimization at times. Some players report frame rate drops or occasional stuttering, especially in more intense combat scenarios or when there are many enemies on screen. While the game isn't demanding on hardware, the performance can still be inconsistent, which may detract from the experience.

Audio Design: The audio in ORION: Prelude is serviceable but not remarkable. The sound effects for weapons, explosions, and enemies are decent but don’t have a strong impact. The soundtrack is fairly generic, with ambient sci-fi tunes that don’t add much to the atmosphere. While the audio isn't distracting, it doesn’t elevate the experience either. There’s no significant voice acting, which could have added personality and immersion to the game’s characters and story.

Challenges: ORION: Prelude offers a moderate challenge, especially in survival mode. As players progress through waves of enemies, the difficulty increases, requiring players to manage resources, defend positions, and upgrade their gear. However, the lack of diverse enemy types or complex AI behavior can make the game feel repetitive over time.

The game can become quite grindy, as players need to farm resources, mine, and continuously upgrade their weapons and defenses. While this can be fun for a while, it may begin to feel monotonous, especially if playing solo.

Final Thoughts: ORION: Prelude is an ambitious, yet somewhat flawed, survival shooter. While the cooperative gameplay and resource management offer some fun, the overall experience can feel repetitive and lacks the depth needed to keep players fully engaged. The game’s dated graphics, lack of enemy variety, and inconsistent performance hold it back from being a standout title in the genre.

Pros:

Fun cooperative multiplayer with friends
Resource management and upgrading add strategic elements
Some decent combat mechanics
Fairly easy to jump into for casual play
Cons:

Dated graphics and repetitive environments
Weak AI and lackluster enemy variety
Performance issues, including frame drops and stuttering
Lack of story or deep character development
Can become grindy and repetitive over time
ORION: Prelude offers a decent co-op survival experience but struggles to stand out in the crowded first-person shooter market. It’s enjoyable for short sessions with friends, but the lack of long-term depth and technical issues may prevent it from becoming a lasting favorite. | SOLID Game to play with friends you really cant beat 99 cents I love it! | Worth every penny.

76561197999259031,204180,Waveform,0.7666666666666667,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy",4,"аркадная игра, в которой игрок управляет световой волной, меняющей свою форму в зависимости от множества факторов на пути. Геймплей довольно уникален: нужно собирать световые элементы, избегать препятствий и следить за траекторией волны, чтобы не попасть в ловушки. Несмотря на свою простоту, игра представляет собой интересный вызов, требующий быстрой реакции и точности.

Игра поражает своим стилем и атмосферой. Каждая стадия сопровождается красивыми и завораживающими визуальными эффектами, и музыка, которая полностью погружает в атмосферу. Однако стоит отметить, что геймплей по мере продвижения становится довольно однообразным. Элементы сложности могут раздражать, и для тех, кто не является поклонником аркадных игр, Waveform может показаться немного скучным.

Плюсы
✅ Красочная визуальная составляющая: Игровые локации красиво оформлены, а световые эффекты добавляют уникальную атмосферу.
✅ Интересная механика: Идея управления волной, которая меняет форму в зависимости от ситуации, действительно выделяется среди аркадных игр.
✅ Завораживающая музыка: Саундтрек игры гармонично сочетается с графикой и усиливает атмосферу.

Минусы
❌ Однообразие: Несмотря на красивую визуальную составляющую, игра со временем становится предсказуемой и скучной.
❌ Проблемы с прогрессией: Некоторые уровни становятся слишком сложными без четкого указания, что делать дальше. Это может вызвать фрустрацию у игроков.
❌ Отсутствие разнообразия в механиках: Геймплей не предлагает большого разнообразия, и отсутствие нововведений может быстро утомить.
❌ Низкая мотивация: Игра не предлагает особых целей, помимо прохождения уровней, что делает её менее увлекательной в долгосрочной перспективе.

Итоговая оценка: ⭐ 4 из 10
Waveform 2012 — это красивая аркадная игра с уникальной механикой, которая может быть интересна на короткий срок."

The suits interaction got better, graphics are very nice and neat, the FULL AUDIO that now characters actually speak! This is really something new and feels really nice.

The collectibles of course are still there, however the way you access and interact with missions selection got even changed. You feel more entertained.

After finishing the main campaign, I can say that the level design is slightly better than the first part, it feels more complex and like it has some improvements, because you now have combination of suits, and can do more with one character.

The amount of grind you would need to actually get the 100% here is quite bjg, if we at least take the Golden Bricks.

I think you really need like 30 hours to get that 100% but if you like LEGO and etc., you should even enjoy it. I personally get frustrated from this so I will not do it.

Overall the game feels really better than the first one, and I have a fresh mind on both of them, so I can assure you that. (Also the game got a bit funnier because of the actual dialogues of the characters)

Also worth mentioning that the final battle is really ""meh"", and the ""DC Super Heroes"" just appear in the last 2 levels, if not considering Superman. | Uma grande evolução para os jogos Lego, trazendo muitas inovações para a franquia, mas ainda com problemas que atrapalham muito a jogatina, como a mecânica de voo.

Додали ще відкрий світ, але він пустий і не цікавий, як гра дитинства піде, якщо грати чисто сюжет, якщо закривати як і минулу частину на 100 відсотків, дуже нудно.

This game is unapproachable for new and returning players, as the bots do not offer a significant challenge and matchmaking lobbies are filled with players who have simply been playing the game longer than you. There is no skilled matchmaking, so picking up and learning this game is just not worth the mental effort.

Great game.

You will not be able to play every character due to some being behind old dlc that isn't available but the selection is still better than the ps3 version.

Un jeu absolument génial, bien qu'assez rapide il reste une belle pépite d'or. | pinche juego todo hermoso, lo juegue en navegador pero nunca me lo pude pasar, hasta que me lo compre y pude cumplir lo que deje pendiente xd. recomendadisimo 10/10 | ""ВТОРЖЕНИЕ 2"" - это ЛЕГЕНДАРНЫЙ сиквел... НЕСУЩЕСТВУЮЩЕГО ""Вторжения 1"", воплощенный в жизнь силами одного единственного Алексея Абраменко.

Перед вами самое настоящее ИНДИ. Из этого следует, что в игре нет вообще ничего лишнего (например, СЮЖЕТА), только самый СМАК: движение слева направо, стрельба, рядовые ""болванчики"", ""болванчики посложнее"" (мехи с мечами, мехи с пулеметами и ракетницами, мехи с КЛЕШНЯМИ и СТАЛКЕРЫ - такие ТИПА ПСЫ, цепляющиеся за все вокруг, кидающие в вас мусорец, машущие хвостом-мечом и ОТРЫГИВАЮЩИЕ снаряды прямо изо рта) и боссы (3 штуки в ассортименте).

Главная фишка игры - ФИЗИКА: на картах разбросана куча предметов по типу ящиков, камней, бревен и прочего, которые можно толкать, ломать, бросать (например, ПРЯМО В ВАС). Порой это создает прикольные ситуации (когда, сидя в мехе, хватаешь клешней одного врага и выстреливаешь им в другого). Но (ИМХО) во время сражений с боссами это попросту создает дополнительные проблемы и раздражает.

В общем и целом добавить-то больше и нечего. Посему - ИТОГИ. ""ВТОРЖЕНИЕ 2"" стоит всего 150 рублей, т.е. продается по цене килограмма мытого картофеля, плитки шоколада ""Аленка"" или стакана лапши Ottogi Jin Ramen (Spicy). За эту скромную сумму вы НЕИРОНИЧНО поддерживаете СОЛО-ИНДИ-разработчика, трудящегося над сиквелом (судя по его YouTube-каналу), и добавляете в свою библиотеку хоть сколько-то самобытную и простенькую игру. Как по мне, неплохая сделка. Но! Если вы не так часто играли в экшен-платформеры и хотите познакомиться с жанром, то лучше обратите внимание на более матерые проекты: Shovel Knight, Hollow Knight, Dead Cells, Blasphemous, Metal Slug, Broforce, Castlevania, Contra и пр."

 | Щоб пограти в неї в кооперативі (чим ми й займалися), довелося встановлювати сторонній софт, аби гра хоча б через LAN могла підключатися. Це зайняло багато часу на розв’язання проблем і працювало не дуже стабільно, але пройти гру було можливо — що ми й зробили.

У цілому, суть гри зводиться до одноманітного знищення мобів і босів та лутінгу. І якщо з останнім усе чудово — гра пропонує багато цікавих предметів і можливостей для їх покращення — то баланс у боях на рівні майстер залишає бажати кращого. Спочатку проходиш гру комфортно, без особливих труднощів, а потім  раптово зустрічаєш рівень, або боса, який буквально вичавлює з тебе всі наявні ресурси. Можливо, на нижчих рівнях складності баланс кращий, а може, навпаки, занадто легкий — не знаю.

Сюжет цілком нормальний для такого жанру, графіка хороша, анімації скілів чудові, та й у цілому прокачування кожного персонажа цікаве. Але гра різко обривається, хоча за предметами та розвитком персонажа було відчуття, що вона має тривати хоча б до 70-го рівня. Хотілося більше часу на прокачування, а не просто проходити те саме вдруге, як пропонує гра.

Загалом, класно, що розробники створили щось нове, самостійне й не схоже на інші всесвіти, але реалізація вийшла трохи сируватою — чогось не вистачає, а щось, навпаки, варто було б доопрацювати. | Accessible, Fun, has mods to add complexity, and I could run it on a toaster.

It just feels smooth where it needs to be, sharp and responsive and I appreciate the aesthetic design throughout, not just because of the Japanese theme, but the overall tone of the artwork. Also arrows are effective which is nice to see in a TW game. 10/10 and then some with workshop mods. | Total War: Shogun 2 - это суровый мир самураев, династий и стратегических сражений, который сразу же захватил мое внимание. Эта игра не просто стратегия, это целая эпоха, в которой каждый выбор может изменить ход истории. 

Плюсы:
1. Сюжет игры, основанный на исторических событиях, позволяет взять на себя роль одного из кланов и вести его к власти. Это не просто борьба за территорию, но и глубокая стратегическая игра, где нужно учитывать политические интриги, дипломатические отношения и экономическое развитие. Каждый выбор имеет значение, и это придает игре особую глубину.
2. Атмосфера Японии периода Сэнгоку передана с невероятной детализацией для игры 2011 года: от красивых пейзажей до неплохо проработанных юнитов, каждый элемент создает ощущение погружения в игру.
3. Музыкальное оформление заслуживает отдельного лайка! Звуки природы, традиционная японская музыка и эпические мелодии во время сражений создают уникальную атмосферу, которая усиливает погружение в игру.
4. Огромный плюс игры в том, что какую-никакую кампанию можно проходить с другом! Это очень круто, весело и дает больше разнообразия для совместных стратегических действий.

Минусы:
1. Иногда искусственный интеллект может показаться не совсем адекватным, а некоторые элементы управления слишком топорные и требуют времени на привыкание. 
2. В некоторых моментах игра может показаться медленной, особенно в начале, когда нужно развивать экономику и строить армию (на что уходит куча времени).

Total War: Shogun 2 - это великолепное сочетание стратегии и истории, которое оставляет после себя теплые эмоции и желание вернуться в этот удивительный мир. Если вы любите стратегические игры, серию Тотал Вар и просто хотите на чилле/на расслабоне погонять самураев по карте, то, игра вам определенно понравится. | Fuck you corpos for destroying a great game! Can't run mods, and without em still crashes, thx assholes | 全战里最喜欢的一代，即使是十年前的游戏在今天看来依旧雄风犹在，使用reshade后画质甚至已达到了电影级，再者幕府2作为开山之作幕府1的续作，发售之后再次成为全战不得不品的经典之作，全战系列除了几个外传没买都已经有了，战锤3可能对于战锤这个ip来说是史诗级游戏，但作为一款全战来说，我个人而言对此并不满意，单从战斗方面来说，幕府2的精密细节水准无出其右，也是第一部着重于pvp对战平衡来制作的全面战争，在当时具有跨时代的意义，在幕府2之后发售的罗马2则开始沦为血条全战，以及之后的所有作品，全都不再是1对1的战斗，而是血条制度，战斗细节逐渐敷衍，空气刀逐渐盛行，玩起来已然失去了全战该有的精髓，食之无味弃之可惜，这些就像在玩传奇一样无趣，就连战前演讲的设计也被废除了，只有特定的事件战役才有战前演讲，不知是说他越做越大了还是越来越商业了，除了堆量卖dlc就是敷衍中的敷衍，ca的新作法老就是一个最好的例子，也别提因为想要为法老引流宣传对老作品进行强制更新的操作，玩家曾尝试退版本来抗议，但ca一意孤行不为所动，并禁用了退版本的功能，此举导致了幕府2的mod社区遭受重创。地图模组全部失效，武家之殇的mod也出现一些闪退无声音的问题，pvp的聊天功能被删除，除此之外未对游戏推出任何的实质性更新内容，社区管理也只是一味的捂嘴不让说，禁止提出建议，仿佛在ca眼里，他们忠实的老玩家已失去了利用价值，只有迎合战锤的新玩家才是ca目前的摇钱树和救命稻草，三国的停更导致只到汉末，三国也是名存实亡，ca时至今日可惜还是未曾吸取教训，仍然拒绝沟通，一意孤行已成为常态，就看ca他这种态度还能走多远，小心，法老的失败已经使得世嘉逐渐失去耐心，也是不得不重新评估你ca的实际可存价值，下一作如果还是法老这种质量，那离解散重组已不再遥远



最后给大家推荐一下我自制的一个系列，亡灵侵袭，在经历一年的更新后已基本成型，已分成12家族版本，整合了工坊一个我觉得不错的类148城mod，加上目前的一共拥有66个新兵种，可玩性max

В своём жанре, говорят, - Король. Оспорить не могу, я этой нише редкий гость.

Прошёл за вечерок (5ч). Легко не было, но наловчиться можно.

Реиграбельность хорошая. Пришёл в жанр после знакомства с Intravenous, там больше стелс конечно, но тем не менее. | Incredible game with tight, demanding, satisfying action, with detailed and unique art, and an amazing soundtrack. Somewhere in there is a story too, but I couldn't tell over how much I enjoy the vibes and combat. | Oyunu kendimce değerlendirmem gerekirse tek kelime yeterli. MÜKEMMEL,kısa ve öz. İnanılmaz eğlenceli ve hızlı. Oyunu almayı düşünenler için şunu diyeyim normalde tam fiyatını hak eden bir oyun ama dolar kuru malum. İndirimde iken asla kaçırmayın. 2'yi de en kısa süre içinde oynamayı düşünüyorum. İndirime girerse ve vaktim olursa tabi. Ha son sonrası bölümünü de kesin oynayın.
Şimdi bu oyunun iyi ve kötü(ciddi kötüden çok daha iyi olabilirdi tarzı*) yönlerine detaylı bir bakış atalım.

Oyunun iyi yönleri:
1. Oynanış süresine göre gayet derin ve psikolojik gerilim/gizem/aksiyon temasındaki hikaye asla sıkmıyor.
2. Oyun 80ler döneminin atmosferini üç beş pikselle o kadar iyi betimliyor ki. Görseller çok hoş döşemelerdeki detaylardan araç çizimlerine hatta silahların detaylarına kadar iyi uğraşılmış . Ciddi bir emek var sanat tasarımı konusunda.
3. Oyundaki hasar sistemi böyle bir oyun için çok üst düzey. Vahşeti ve acıyı(içinizdeki sadist gayet tatmin olacak*) iliklerimize kadar hissediyoruz. İyi ki acı çekme ses koymamışlar oyunu ruhsuz havasını da mahvederdi zaten. Ne yalan söyleyeyim şunun verdiği vuruş hissinin %1'i olmayan ""gerçekçi"" fpsler varken hele.
4. MÜZİKLER basitler ama çok iyiler. Synthwave,hafif bir house ve erken edm . Neon ışıklar altında adam kesmek istiyorsunuz birden. Çeşitliliği de yeterli ama tabi bazı kusurları var.
5. Seviye tasarımları genel olarak hoş ve taktiksel yaklaşıma uygun. Save sistemi yeni oynarken saçma gelebilir ama alışınca çok orantılı olduğunu görüyoruz.
6. Pompalı ve kesici aletlerin hissiyatı çok güzel. Tam kıvamında.
7.Bitirme animasyonları tatminkar.
8. Oyun seviyeler içinde ve seviyeler dışında oyuncuyu yeteri kadar kıvamında yönlendirip ipucu veriyor ama bunlar genelde ne yapman gerektiğinden çok ,nereye gitmen gerektiğin hakkında oluyor.
9.Kapı mekaniği var ya mükemmel düşünülmüş ve harika işliyor.
10. Ufak detay konusunda çok daha fazla şey var ama oyunun havası ile çoğu kişinin fark edemeyecek olması üzücü...

Oyunun kötü(yerseniz :) yönleri:
1. Kontrol şeması eskide kalan bir tarzı kullanıyor ama tamamen de bir 90lar oyunu havası yok. Alışması zaman istiyor ve hareketler bazen güzel hissettirmiyor ve kolayca haritadaki objelere takılabiliyorsunuz.
2. Yapay zeka sıkıntılı ve toplandıkları yerlerde birbirlerine giriyorlar. Özellikle giriş koridorunun köşelerine pusup ateş edip dışarı cıkarsanız bazen sizi önemsemeyen ve köşede takılan düşmanlarla karşılaşacaksınız. Ayrıca bazen 2 metre önünü göremeyen, arkası dönük iken taa haritanın ucundan 1 mslik reaksiyonla tek atabiliyor. Özellikle sanırım cam varsa görüş alanları mı artıyor ne oluyorsa. Ha kötü ama şikayetçi miyim? Hayır tabi ki :). Kendi lehime de kullandığım çok oldu , rage geçirdiğim de.
3. Oyunun öğrenim eğrisi özellikle ilk 2 saat için oynama isteğini kaçıracak cinsten o yüzden sabırlı olun. Onlarca hatta belki de bir kaç yüz kez deneyeceksiniz oyun boyunca. R tuşu çok iyi bir arkadaşınız olacak.
4. Pompalı ne kadar iyiyse M16 başta olmak diğer tüm ateşli silahların hissiyatı o kadar kötü.Boncuklu tabanca gibi yer yer. RNG ve aiminize bağlı sık sık çok düşür hasar veriyor ama AI'ınkiler istisnasız tek atıyor. Bu yüzden burası daha iyi olabilirdi.
5. Köpekleri seven birisi olarak bu oyunda nefret ettim muhtemelen kasti olarak yapılmış bir hitbox sorunları var .Bazen yer yer vuruşunuz oturmuyor,üstünden geçebiliyor.
6. Mermilerin düşmanları delmesine güvenmeyin bazen iki kişide bile takılıyor ve arkadaki baygınlık geçirip uyanıyor. Muhtemelen yine kasti yapıldı.
7. Hikaye bölük pörçük ve hiçbir şey anlamayacaksınız. Çünkü 2. oyunu oynamanız lazım . Ha oyunu seri olarak değerlendirmezsek gerçekten hikaye anlatımı tekil olarak orta halli ve sizi sorulara boğuyor.
8. Her objenin hitboxu farklı projectile tipine farklı davranabiliyor. Spoiler vermeyeyim ama siper aldığınız yer duvar değilse asla güvende hissetmeyiniz. Oyun bu problemler hakkında zerre uyarmıyor.
9. Oyun kısa olmasaydı müzikler sağlam baş ağrıtırdı he zira hepsi aynı notaları dönüyor.
10. Bir iki yerde iyi olan seviye tasarımı birden işkenceye dönüşüyor ve yine uyarı yok. Spoiler olmasın ama ben karakol diyeyim oynayanlar anladı...
11. Oyun ben de 1080'de ölçek hatası veriyordu 720'de veya her oyunu açtığımda ayarlardan ölçeklemeyi değiştirmem gerekiyordu. Ha tabi angaryayı yapmadım ve 720pde oynadım. Yapımcı ekip görürse lütfen şu soruna bakınız.

Tekrardan söylüyorum oyunun ciddi kötü bir yanını açıkcası bulamadım. Neredeyse şaheser düzeyinde. Dediğim şeylere bir tık bakılıp düzenlense 10 verir ve gelmiş geçmiş en iyi oyunlardan birisi olduğunu rahatlıkla derdim. Tabi bu hali bile çoğusu için efsane olmasına yetecektir.

Öneriler: Sakin iken oynayın iyi bir klavye/mouse/kulaklık setini tam performans keyif için öneririm... Kesinlikle sakin olun!!! Her seviye öncesi keşif için seviye haritasının(binanın*) etrafında en az iki tur atın. Çünkü siz atmazsanız oyun size üç buçuk turcuğu çok güzel attırıyor. Keşife rağmen bu adam nereden çıktı demeniz çok olası hehehehe.

ÖZET: 9/10(ÇOK İYİ OYUN)Kesinlikle alıp bu deneyimi tadın. ŞİDDETLE tavsiye edilir. Oyunun teknik sıkıntıları genel oynanışta sadece yarım saatinize maksimum etki edecek cinsten ve eminim çoğu kişi farketmeyecek bile. Herkes benim gibi oyunları bozmayı başaramıyor... İncelememde eksikler varsa yorumlarda belirtin ki insanların kafasındaki tüm soru işaretlerini yok edelim.

Buraya kadar okuduysan teşekkürler ve halen neyi bekliyorsun alsana şu oyunu!!!

Overall a pretty good game and time.

Sidenote your buying a boomer game expect problems look online how to solve them so you don't get up leaving a dumb review because you expected a 2003 game for $0.13 to work flawlessly right away. | To start, this'll serve as sort of a general review of the series but go more in-depth with my favorite Hitman game and one of my favorite stealth games ever: Hitman 2: Silent Assassin. Now, people who talk about ""Does it hold up?"" have to understand how it was received on release to compare it to playing through it today. Codename 47 on release was mixed for various reasons, even IGN 20 odd years ago complained about no mid-mission saves in that game so hold back your video essays, it's not a new or special opinion. What is special is the sequel. Hitman 2 has the lasting impact the other entries in the series lack. Blood Money yes has the gameplay and extra cool things you can do especially creatively, but Hitman 2's aesthetics, level designs, atmosphere, story, that's where it's at for me. The Church hub world is so nostalgic to me and Vittorio is a very very powerful character narrative wise. Not to say Hitman 2's gameplay can't be fun in it's own right, but it definitely can feel overtuned at times. Really, I think this is a must play for any Hitman fan or really any stealth game fan in general, this and Blood Money. Blood Money is still G.O.A.T. just not my personal favorite. Thanks for all the fun memories on Original XBOX Hitman 2: SA. :) | Great game but pretty much unplayable without mods in my experience. Badly needs a rerelease. | Massive step up in every way from the original. Introduces a detection meter, a toggle sprint button, save mechanic, more weapons, more missions and more freedom. Not nearly as janky and buggy as the first in terms of controls and AI detection. Great story, Jesper Kyd kills it on the soundtrack once again. Some missions aren't great but I didn't find myself struggling as much to get through them as I did with the worst of Codename 47. | Hitman: Silent Assassin is a great continuation and a big improvement over the original. Unfortunately, it’s almost unplayable on modern hardware—it barely runs, the AI is all over the place, and textures often turn black.

Felizmente, Metro Redux consegue se diferenciar nesse sentido ao trazer ao mercado um valor de produção muito grande, ao mesmo tempo em que resgata experiências já um tanto quanto antigas. Usando a versão mais recente da 4A Engine, o pacote permite reviver as experiências de Metro 2033 e Metro Last Light com gráficos revitalizados e com uma jogabilidade mais refinada do que a vista nas versões originais.

Tivemos a oportunidade de conferir a remasterização na íntegra e, nesta análise, trazemos tudo aquilo que você precisa saber sobre ela. Além disso, aproveitamos para retornar aos lançamentos originais para conferir o quanto elas se diferenciam do novo trabalho feito pela 4A Games.


Um novo fôlego para a franquia:

A principal novidade de Metro Redux fica por conta do uso da versão mais recente da 4ª Engine, que já se mostra bem adaptada aos requisitos da nova geração de consoles. Na prática, isso se reflete em modelos tridimensionais com uma qualidade melhor, em um novo sistema de iluminação e em texturas com um nível maior de detalhes.

O maior beneficiado pelo novo motor gráfico é Metro 2033, lançado no já distante ano de 2010. Embora o game ainda possa ser considerado belo (especialmente no PC), o trabalho feito pelos desenvolvedores conseguiu trazer a ele um novo nível de qualidade — o que deve ajudar a justificar o retorno daqueles que já conferiram a versão original.

Além de adotar modelos de personagens com uma qualidade maior de detalhes, o game ganha texturas em alta resolução que permitem apreciar melhor a direção de arte da 4A Games. O título também traz monstros com um visual aprimorado e diversas adições às suas animações, o que garante uma maior naturalidade de movimentos tanto para personagens humanos quanto para as criaturas mutantes que você deve enfrentar.

Metro 2033 também ganhou algumas atualizações em suas mecânicas de jogo, adotando um sistema de controles idêntico àquele visto na sequência Last Light. Outro ponto que mostra a dedicação dos desenvolvedores a realmente fazer um trabalho de qualidade são as cenas de corte do jogo, que agora são reproduzidas exclusivamente em primeira pessoa — com direito a diversos momentos interativos.


Experiência que se sustenta:

O ponto que mais se destaca no conteúdo visto em Metro Redux é a maneira como a franquia continua parecendo “fresca”, mesmo que seu primeiro capítulo tenha sido lançado há quase meia década. Muito disso se deve à ambientação explorada pela 4A Games, que se assemelha muito mais a um game do gênero Survival Horror do que a um FPS convencional.

Talvez ciente de que nem todos os jogadores podem se interessar por um título com certas restrições, o estúdio decidiu criar dois estilos de jogabilidade: Survival e Spartan. Enquanto o primeiro reduz a quantidade de munições e armamentos que você encontra (o que torna a experiência mais assustadora), o segundo age como um “jogo de tiro convencional”, permitindo que você seja mais descuidado durante os combates.

Independente da opção que você escolher, a experiência básica de ambos os jogos se mantém impressionantemente sólida. Grande parte disso se deve à presença de adversários com uma boa inteligência artificial (que sofreu aprimoramentos notáveis na versão Redux, especialmente em Metro 2033) e também à maneira como os combates são construídos.


Vale a pena? Muito bom mesmo vale muito a pena !!!

Devemos ser bem sinceros: caso você já tenha finalizado Metro 2033 e Metro Last Light, a aquisição de Metro Redux não é exatamente necessária — afinal, por maiores que sejam as melhorias apresentadas, em essência os jogos permanecem idênticos. No entanto, quem não pôde conferir as experiências em sua época de lançamento (ou simplesmente quer revivê-las) não poderia pedir muito mais da remasterização.

Nesse sentido, surge como vantagem a possibilidade de poder adquirir as duas versões Redux de forma individual através do meio digital. Dessa maneira, você pode escolher somente o título que mais lhe interessa, deixando de lado aquele com qual já tem mais familiaridade — algo que, devemos admitir, deve prejudicar um pouco as vendas de Last Light em sua versão para PC.

Caso você simplesmente nunca tenha entrado no universo de Metro, essa é a melhor opção para conhecer o universo da franquia. Metro: Redux é a versão definitiva dos dois títulos da série e seu grande nível de qualidade deixa uma boa perspectiva do que podemos esperar para os trabalhos futuros do estúdio 4A Games.


Pros:

* Jogabilidade renovada ajuda a atualizar Metro 2033
* Nova engine contribui para tornar os títulos ainda mais bonitos
* Modos de jogo agradam tanto aos fãs do terror quanto a quem gosta de jogos de tiro mais tradicionais


Contras:

* Alguns bugs do passado permanecem incomodando | Игра хорошо набирает оборот. Слаба в геймплее но интересна на ощущениях. Типа остановиться сложно играя, но в общем формате - надоест. Плюс уровень, который стоял Рэйджер изи - довольно противный уровень, поэтому играйте на среднем. Ах да, концовка, оказывается, что тебе нужно каждый куст посмотреть - идиотизм.

Este fue mi caso, y vaya que frustrante el solo hecho de hacer que el juego funcione. Te recomiendo encarecidamente que busques una guía de steam que aborda los diversos problemas del juego y como poder solucionarlo, a mi en lo personal me dio bastante trabajo pero finalmente se logró y confirmo que SI SE PUEDE JUGAR EN PC MODERNOS (digamos con cpu de más de 6 nucleos fisicos)

Ya que quieres probablemente ir al grano, te recomiendo algun walkthrough con marcas de tiempos de logros y coleccionables, en mi caso seguí casi al pie de la letra la guia en Youtube de ""Indie Author Gaming"", pero les recomiendo que compren la guadaña lo antes posible y no hagan como él (y como yo que lo quise imitar pero me arrepenti xd) ya que querrán subir la guadaña y los guanteletes a lvl max, ya cuando consigan la Espada del Armagedón te la dan a lvl max, por ende puedes obviar el uso de DevoraCaos casi en su totalidad o al menos no usarla como arma principal. Y mucha paciencia para los estúpidos logros de matar 1550 enemigos a caballo y recorrer 100km xd.

Si no has jugado Darksiders 1, te recomiendo absolutamente la ""Warmastered Edition"", pero de todas maneras dejo mi reseña positiva ya que el juego en sí es increíblemente divertido y variado en su contenido. | Jogo bem maneiro , joguei ele no XBOX 360 , resolvi adicionar a coleção , Vale a pena pegar a versão Warmastered Edfition. | un muy buen titulo de acción

Gostei muito de Red Faction: Armageddon! O jogo entrega uma ação futurista de qualidade, com armas incríveis e veículos superlegais que adicionam um ótimo dinamismo à experiência. A campanha tem uma duração perfeita, ajustada exatamente ao que o jogo oferece, garantindo que a experiência não se estenda além do necessário.

Finalizar o jogo uma vez foi o suficiente para mim. Foi uma experiência completa e satisfatória, sem a necessidade de seguir para um New Game. Se você busca um jogo de ação com mecânicas interessantes e ritmo bem ajustado, Red Faction: Armageddon é uma excelente escolha!

Nota: 8/10 | The game is great fun (including the DLC), though could have been more. The ability to rapidly repair, allowed me to destroy stuff with peace of mind. Expect Armageddon to be more of a cross between the original Red Faction and Guerrilla, rather than be just a sequel to Guerrilla. | Bon jeu, déjà joué sur console. toujours un plaisir d'y rejoué via Steam ( je joue sur Steam Deck Oled et il fonctionne trés bien ) 🤩

[b]The Good[/b]
1. Audio: Music/Soundtrack, Sound FX, Voice acting
2. Visuals: Art style/direction, Creature/Vehicle/Armor/Weapon designs
3. Gameplay: Gunplay, Movement, Powers, Destructible environment (limited in what can be destroyed, but very satisfying), along with a Re-construction power. Some of the physics-manipulating weapons are amazing.
4. Variety/Replay Value: Upgrade system, along with a large selection of weapons and a moderate selection of powers would allow for about 3 distinct play-styles/play-throughs (although the story is linear, and so it would be a once-a-year endeavor). Moderately large amount of enemies
5. Writing/Characters/Setting: Although the setting and main villain are just okay, most of the writing was very engaging. The 3 main protagonists had me rooting for them [spoiler]and often surprised me with how competent and active they were in the story, even when off-screen[/spoiler]. 
6. Difficulty: Medium difficulty setting was a good time.
7. Pacing and Length: Even with a few rough spots in the writing/gameplay/technical issues, the strong pacing and variety helped smooth over these rough edges. Story doesn't overstay its welcome.

[b]The Bad[/b]
1. Bugs: During cut-scene/transitions, my game would often bring up the pause menu without my input, including when I would close the pause menu, only to have it pop right back up. I think I had one freeze that required a restart, but am not sure.
2. Ending: Gameplay-wise, the ending felt a bit underwhelming, though the story was fine.
3. Antagonist/Villain is unbelievable.
4. High Fantasy/Plot Armor: I don't like either. Having the grounded characters/dialogue/setting(half of it)/ tone clashing with most of the main characters' plot armor and high-octane-over-the-top action sequences moderately bothered me many times throughout my 10 hour play-through, but the pacing usually re-engaged me quickly after each instance. Like the Fallout series, or Rick and Morty, Armageddon doesn't take itself too seriously but serious enough for the roller-coaster theme park comedy-drama to be effective at the key points.
5. Originality: it's not. You'll have seen this story, these characters, these abilities, these gameplay systems/mechanics done before and generally better in other games. It is charming and fun in spite of this."

Never mind the WW2 setting, if you like real-time strategy or strategy in general, this is definitely a must-play. History buffs will appreciate the attention to detail and many nods to WW2 media such as Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan, as it portrays in part the efforts of the 101st Airborne during WW2. 

It's really nice to not worry about resource farming and just focus on combat. You generate resources by capturing territory, which is something you would be doing anyway. The infantry units are made up of squads which you control in their entirety instead of by individual units, and their AI makes them take cover, go prone while under suppressive fire, etc. Lots of variety in units and everything has a purpose, even builder units are effective (e.g., American engineers can use flamethrowers which are great against infantry and buildings). | If you want a good RTS campaign this is for you, its gameplay mechanics unique over the traditional RTS games of the time. | 거진 20년 된 실시간 전략게임입니다.

 | Orcs Must Die! 2 – це продовження першої частини, яке додає ще більше битв з орками та динамічного геймплею. Найбільша перевага – можливість грати вдвох, разом планувати розташування пасток і захищати замок від хвиль ворогів. Також стало більше варіантів покращення пасток, що дозволяє експериментувати та створювати власні стратегії.

Проте є й недоліки. Графіка здається гіршою, ніж у першій частині – менш чітка, з дещо розмитими текстурами. Рухи персонажів і керування теж поступаються оригіналу, але це не заважає насолоджуватися грою, особливо в кооперативному режимі. Шкода, що немає української мови, хоча англійський текст і озвучка досить вдалі та додають грі атмосфери.

Загалом Orcs Must Die! 2 – чудове продовження з цікавими покращеннями, більшими рівнями та динамічним ігровим процесом. Незважаючи на деякі недоліки, гра захоплює й добре підійде тим, хто любить поєднання стратегії та екшену. (А ще вбивати орків.) | noice shooter / tower defense hybrid I know. It's fun, it's flashy, it's cool looking, you're cool, everything's cool.
Map design, sound effects, music, voices, art style, graphics, it's all done very well and combines into a game that's just.. a lot of fun to play.

You have an array of cool weapons to unlock, and ditto traps. You're also totally free to choose a playstyle. If you don't want to rely heavily on traps, you can go with projectile or melee weapons, or you can go full no-touch mastermind and use only traps and maneuvering, this is left up to you in the most organic way possible - you just pick the equipment you prefeer at the start of the round and that's it.

Опять мимо - все немногочисленые карты доступны сразу и почти ничем друг от друга не отличаются. Зачем покупал полный доступ не знаю. | Such a nice concept... but sadly ruined by huge netcode issues.

An online game of Dungeonland is often unplayable due to lag. Your character will teleport, and sometimes several seconds of action will be missing and then happen instantly, making you dead.

This happens even when you are playing with a friend living near you... in some huge city where the internet is fast no less. So I can safely say it's not my hardware, but the game which is broken.

There are many good ideas in this game, but sadly when a technical issue makes your multiplayer game unplayable in multiplayer, it invalidates everything you've done.

Can we dream for a fix? Sadly, it's unlikely to happen at this point. But who knows?

Unless that unlikely improvement happens, avoid this game. It's kinda worse than the game just being bad on all levels, because it feels like we're missing on a pretty fine experience here... | A unique little game made by Paradox, doomed by not being supported anymore.

Now, don't get me wrong. The only reason why you would want to buy and subsequently play this game is if you had a bunch of friends who also want to do so. As it is, the game is dead. There's very few people who still play and since this game is absolutely horrible with AI (and even if it had decent AI, it wouldn't be fun for long) you'll have a bad time.

The gameplay involves you either dungeoncrawling through a fun, cartoony dungeon filled with monsters and traps while playing one of three classes (who also split up into 3 specializations). All of those have a very different role: The warrior is clearly the tank, the rogue is perfect for annihilating big foes and the mage is support and AoE damage.

The group dynamic between the 3 players is great and lots of fun, but it's way more fun to be the 4th one: The Dungeon Maestro. In this gamemode you get to direct the dungeon! You can use spells to actively harm the players, you can place monsters and even minibosses to create obstacles or make already premade monsterpacks even scarier and at the end you even get to control a huge Boss yourself!

You can take different kinds of ""cards"" (which are either monsterpacks or spells) with you, and the variety and combo-potential is pretty cool. Almost all of the 22 hours I have put into this game are from this mode, aside from farming for some hero items via an exploit (which has been fixed though). I'd still be playing it, if other people were to, too.

As it stands, the game isn't really playable anymore. If you do have 3 friends and a bunch of free time, get a 4 pack. Now. The game's tons of fun and very unique, and you'll laugh your asses off (while cursing the wretched Dungeon master, of course)! 

If you do not though...Don't bother. Paradox, if you ever revive a game, do a Dungeonland 2 and support it like crazy! | Abandonend Game without Servers. DO NOT BUY. A shame that there is no disclaimer on the store page that its abandoned.

AVOID!! | The Showdown Effect é um jogo 2.5D de ação que tem como inspiração os filmes de ação dos anos 80 e 90, e totalmente multiplayer.

Sua jogabilidade é muito simples e a prática é possível se pegar em alguns minutos de jogo. Ela se baseia em PVP com reflexos e movimentos rápidos, desde ofensivos à defensivos. São diversos tipos de armas (como pistolas, rifles, espadas e facas de arremesso) que trazem uma experiência bem diversificada. Também é possível carregar duas armas, iguais ou diferentes, além do poder exclusivo que cada personagem possui, e é algo que passa a estimular muito a estratégia individual de cada jogador. 

Uma trilha sonora fantástica, onde a guitarra é muito bem explorada com faixas que aumentam ainda mais a adrenalina no meio das partidas e deixa toda a experiência ainda mais cativante. Infelizmente não são muitas faixas, mas as que existem, são muito bem feitas.

Possuidor de um ótimo sistema de customização, é possível deixar seu personagem da forma que você desejar, inclusive as armas que ele vai usar. São diversas skins para armas e personagens, que conseguem atender a todos os gostos de todos os jogadores.

Infelizmente o único problema é a dificuldade de encontrar partidas pela região. É muito difícil encontrar jogadores brasileiros, forçando-nos assim a jogar muito mais com estrangeiros, que muitas vezes podem te expulsar da partida dependendo do seu ping, passando assim sendo bem mais fácil chamar amigos para jogar.

El mundo de los multijugadores masivos es realmente amplio, lo he dicho en innumerables ocasiones. Te puedes encontrar desde la joya más pulida, a la basura más maloliente. Y la única forma de saber diferenciar entre estas dos opciones, es la mera experiencia. Jugando y explorando. Probando cualquier cosa que te encuentres.

Debo admitir que Spiral Knights estaba en mi lista de ""No me interesa"" desde hace un tiempo. Y no tenía planeado jugarlo, la verdad; no me llamaba demasiado la atención. Tanto su aspecto gráfico como su gameplay se veían mediocres y sin emoción alguna. Todo cambió el día que buscaba un juego gratuito, que pudiéramos jugar yo y otra persona, y que por lo menos fuera de Rol. Spiral fue el único disponible en aquel momento. Tenía malas vibraciones por lo dicho anteriormente, de que estaba en mi lista de ""No me interesa"", pero no tenía otra opción que probarlo.

Algo que muchos juegos recientes, tanto de 2015, 16 y 17 tienen, son intros súper largas en innecesarias, tutoriales extensos en los que el juego te [b]obliga[/b] por completo a hacer lo que [i]supuestamente[/i] deberías hacer y más y más ayudas innecesarias. Este no es el caso. La introdución es sencilla, corta y divertida. Te enteras del concepto del juego en menos de medio minuto y su historia. A continuación, te lleva al editor para tu personaje. No hay una variedad exagerada, pero qué más te da, si es un juego de Rol, en menos de 2 minutos estarás cambiandote de armaduras.
Ahora vamos a la chicha, al asunto, al mojo. Lo que hace que se me infle la vena del cuello cuando juego un multijugador. El tutorial.

Cuanto menos mejor, sin duda. Me encanta que el juego me ponga en la mítica situación de aprender a base de hostias. No se aleja mucho a Spiral. Es cierto que te enseñan conceptos básicos como el movimiento, el ataque, la cobertura etc. Pero por lo demás, el resto tendrás que aprenderlo por ti mismo. No agota, es muy rápido, muy activo, y no te toman por tontico al que haya que indicarle como hacer todo. Mis dieces, caballeros.

Hemos terminado el tutorial, llegamos a los inicios verdaderos del juego. El punto en el que la gran mayoría de jugadores deciden si continuar, o dejarlo porque les aburre o por el motivo que sea. Lo primero de todo y en lo que me di cuenta es que los jugadores inexpertos tienen un mundo/canal para ellos solos. Pueden interactuar con jugadores que estén en su mismo canal (o sea, mismo nivel y mismo avance en las misiones e historia) Lo cual motiva al competitivo y el trabajo en equipo, lo cual en los inicios es bastante útil. Las misiones iniciales, hasta llegar al [i]Nudo[/i] del juego son bastante fluidas, cortas y más o menos sencillas. Abundan los puzles, que se repetirán de distintas maneras a lo largo del resto del juego, para que los jugadores sepan qué hacer en cada situación. He llegado a estancarme en estos puntos, pero no más de unos minutos. Son sencillos y divertidos. No suponen un gran desafío, pero están ahí y acompañan bien. Tras superar varios desafíos y picos de dificultad no muy elevados, el juego nos pone en el canal con el resto de jugadores y ya podemos disponer de todas las posibilidades de juego.

Hasta ahí mi resumen general. Todo pinta bien, no? Profundicemos un poco, no todo es de color rosa.

El aspecto gráfico en sí no es ninguna maravilla. Lo cual está bien hasta el punto de que almenos puedas entender qué estás viendo (XD) No requiere mucha potencia, cualquier ordenador podría correrlo sin problemas, incluso me atrevería a decir que si sacasen una versión para Táblet, se podría jugar perfectamente. Las animaciones son fluidas y prácticamente nunca se buggea, almenos, en mis 22 horas de gameplay. Estupendo.

La banda sonora es bastante activa. Tiene variaciones programadas para los distintos eventos durante un nivel, lo cual le da más vida. Esto es algo que no se suele ver mucho en multijugadores masivos. Muy pocos trabajan en su banda sonora. Que vaya acorde con el escenario, o que vaya alternando según situaciones In-Game. Es cierto que las canciones son un poco sosas y no son tan tan animadas como otros muchos MMORPG, pero encaja con el tipo de juego. 

El sistema de misiones y recompensas es bastante impecable. Es cierto que en varias ocasiones al juego se le ha ido la flapa y no te sube la experiencia, a ti o a tu compañero de misión en mi caso, pero por lo demás, sin fallo. Tiene variaciones en la dificultad de las misiones, lo cual es perfecto para jugadores inseguros, atrevidos, o gente que simplemente quiera tomárselo con calma y farmear. Las misiones en Élite son extremadamente divertidas y el propio juego te recompensa por atreverte a probarlas. Puedes ir atrás a farmear en misiones antiguas, pero eh, no puedes hacer misiones de 1 rango inferior al tuyo. En verdad esto la primera vez que lo vi me jodió un poco, pero tiene sentido. Al fin y al cabo, las recompensas de las misiones no son pocas. Poner a un jugador de Rango 6, por ejemplo, farmeando en minutos misiones de rango 3, se puede liar bastante gorda. Además que el juego en sí te obliga a avanzar, y no puedes quedarte haciendo el monguer para chetarte.

Los escenarios son posiblemente el punto más flojo de Spiral. Los niveles iniciales ya mencionados son divertidos. Pero a la larga, lo único que cambia es la longitud del nivel y la dificultad de combate. No aumenta ni la dificultad del propio nivel para avanzar, lo cual convierte el juego en algo ligeramente repetitivo. Pero la verdad es que engancha de todas formas. Los niveles son fluidos y entretenidos, el hecho de que repitan escenarios no repercute en su diversión. Eso sí, debo admitir que no es un juego al que puedas viciar durante horas y horas. Con dos o tres ya estás cansado, pero satisfecho. Ojo, esto no es malo. Prefiero mil veces un juego que te entretenga durante escasas horas que uno que te vicie todo el día y acabes hasta el gorro.

(Lamentablemente no puedo analizar la historia ya que he pasado completamente de ella xD)

Spiral Knights es, sin duda, un gran juego. Y jugándolo he aprendido una gran lección. Actualmente mi lista de ""No me interesa"" supera ya los 4.000 títulos, que se dice pronto. Son muchos juegos, es cierto. Pero el haberme divertido enormemente con Spiral me ha hecho pensar en que posiblemente, si algún día me quedo sin nada que jugar, debería echarlo un vistazo a esa inmensa lista, porque seguro, que inmerecidamente está ahí dentro, algún juego extraordinario.


 | I have a love hate relationship with this game, I love the artwork and content (even though some say it needs more and it does, it is slowly dying) I can 100% say there is no other game like this game and that is what makes it so special. 

Pros: 
Missions give you access to gear and items needed to play the game, they start from the beginning armor to end game gear (nothing thats 100% wanted but it gives you access to play end game content).

There is an arcade side of the game, which was the original concept. 4 gates consisting of 29 floors, but only 24 floors that have monsters. The arcade gates change every 7 days and its random, so every arcade run you do will be different from the last. 

If you wanna merchant, there is plenty of promos you can sink your money into. 

Cons: 
There is a ton of promos, one every 2 weeks. They throw promos out like they are candy and are not working toward new content and game updates. 

If you have to submitted a support ticket then you should expect 2-48 hours of waiting for a reply. This is how they get money out of you, they force you into paying for in-game items with real money cause you cant contact support when you have issues of not getting back into a party. 

The Develops and Gm's are not dedicated to running this game, and their minds are only after $$$$, but you are thinking what gaming company is not only after $$$$? All of them are, for the most part, but this one is one of the worst ones because as I stated they refuse to help you if you need help. I've heard ""sorry we couldnt help you out in time, maybe next time"" after they expected the rest of my party to wait 2-3 hours for me to get back into the party. 

You need to see this game as it truely is, It is only about pretty costumes and accessories and thats it. This game is mainly used to see who looks the best and as a chat room. Just think of this game as a chat room version of Tinder with mini games to play like PvP and missions etc. 


So end point is no i wouldn't recommend this game. | Si lo vas a jugar busca amigos y jueguen juntos será más fácil y divertido.
 
Ahora si vas a jugar solo puedes morirte del asco...

La cosa va así. Entras todo contento, te cuentan una historia muy interesante y con un aspecto grafico muy bonito te pones a jugar, vas campante diciendo ""este juego está bueno"", ""este juego es entretenido"".

Hasta que llegas a cierto rango de la historia donde todo se va a la mierd@.

El juego cuenta con un sistema de progresión bastante interesante tu pj no sube de nivel, si no sus armas, esta subida de nivel se rige por algo llamado ""Fuego"" que se obtiene rompiendo cajas, matando bichos y jefes, llegados a tal punto de fuego tienes que forjar tu arma, para pueda seguir subiendo de nivel, con algo llamado ""cristal de fuego"". Tú dices pues si vamos a forjar ves la interfaz y pone 6 cristales  tienes un 60% de que la forja salga mal, 20 cristales y hay un 100% de éxito, me parece correcto y lo forjas. Hasta ahí todo bien es el tutorial te dan todo lo justo para que te armes decentemente… acá es donde se pone feo.

 Tienes entre ceja y ceja una espada violeta toda suprema con daños de sombras y unos efectos de puta madre, te pones en obra para armarla ya que hay que craftearla y empiezas el arduo viaje bajando con los ascensores piso tras piso para conseguir todo los materiales.
 
Que, todos los pisos son iguales? Naaa.... pues si son todos iguales...
 
Que, bajaste ya 10 niveles y no has encontrado nada aun? 

Tus armas ya no pueden ganar más fuego, pues fórjalas… Que, no te quedan más cristales de fuego? No te preocupes seguro que lo podes comprar en la tienda con las monedas del juego… Que, no las venden y solo las podes comprar con energía? Que es la energía? Ah es la moneda de pago… 

Que, se puede dropear los cristales? En ese caso hay que seguir bajando y conseguir más y… te mataron? pierdes todo lo que estuviste juntando? Naa usa el revivir de emergencia que seguro lo podes comprar con las monedas del juego… Que? Que las monedas del juego no sirven para nada, solo para comprar recetas y alguna que otra cosa mientras bajas?

Lo único que me queda es comprar energía para obtener cristales y orbes no te olvides de los orbes que sin ellos no podrás terminar el arma que quieres… en fin. 

El juego llega a un punto no muy alejado del principio en donde se vuelve un “pay to el contenido del juego”, sin contar que en momentos ya sea solo o con gente el juego te empezará a dar un lag muy molesto, peleas con jefes que están ganadas desde el inicio se pierden, por esos tirones que pega y se pone peor cuando hay más gente…

El juego en si esta bueno no me mal intérpretes, pero llegado un tiempo te frustra el hecho de que te obliguen a pagar para obtener las cosas más fáciles, este juego no es un “pay to fast” como warframe, es como dije antes un “pay to el contenido del juego” si no pagas no podes continuar, los pisos se pones más difíciles, las cosas son más caras. Alguno dirá podes ganar energía con las monedas del juego, si podes pero no rinde tienes que pagar 10.000 coronas (moneda del juego) para tener solo 100 de energía, no rinde por que los cristales y los orbes cuentan más de 100 energías.

En lo personal yo... no lo recomiendo, pero tu podes hacer lo que quieras solo te diré una cosa esas “más de 20 horas jugadas!!” solo fueron eso 20 horas… | This is one of the games I played with a great community. Its unique concept is like none others. I'd definitely recommend this game. It has its ""dying phase"" but I'm really hoping that the Game Devs are still planning to update and put more content to the game. I'd purchase things that this game offer if it gets updated. ( SHOUT OUT: Paging Grey Havens, Please proceed to the Game Dev room now... )

I know. It's boring if you're playing it alone. Make some friends, talk to strangers, don't be aloof. It's very addictive when you have people to share your moments with.

Here's what I thought: 

> Artstyle - Its cute and very unique
> Gameplay - Challenging. Well, not if you have good gears. Bottom line, its all about teamwork. Unless you like to play solo.
> Music - Lovely music you got there bud. Its engaging.
> Community - Its Great! That's why I love this game.
> Players - I'd say 50 - 50. Some players are nice and friendly, some are not.
> Concept - Can you name any game with the same concept? I can't. 
> Auction House - Oh my fudgy bars! Those are very expensive!
> Supply Depot - Nooo! The trade market keeps on raising! Make it stahp! 
> Grinding - Aw man, this is a bad RNG. Need 'em orbs please!
> Guilds - I don't know about you, but I love my guild. First and Last. 
> Wiki - Eh? Is the sidebar really down there? Hmm, care for a fix?
> Steam Login - Why can't I login my Steam to Wiki page? That's crazy, man! 
> Servers - Oh my, why do I have a red dot? Mind if you guys put up some Asian servers? Please?
> Patch Note - Oh come on!, Where the dang are the Patch Notes? I mean sure, you guys post updates on twitter... but....
> DLC - I'd be fine if you make more of 'em DLC's too. Like maybe, a side story like OCH?
> Price Boxes - Will you guys re-release Rageous Stuffs? I've been craving for them since I started playing...
> Coliseum - Ah, no ones playing there anymore. Make some more PVP. Maybe like Capture the Ball? or Chess? or Maze?
> Rank - Man, being a Vanguard ain't that good... What am I supposed to do now? Hoard stuffs? Collect gears?
> Story - The stoy is incomplete. We all got stranded in Cradle. So, there's more content you can actually make here... Like maybe go to the moon? Well, why not?, Cradle has a moon right there in the Main Screen. And what about our homeplanet? our homeworld? What? they're just... gone? Still so many plot holes. And maybe you can have a story on why the Snabolax, Jelly King, Roarmulus twins, and Vanaduke keep on respawning each time we delve deep into the unknow parts of Cradle. Maybe because TIME is reseting? Cause why not, it is the Clockworks... get it? 

Here's hoping, like most of the Knights out there who still enjoys playing this game, that it'll live on for another 5 or more years. Because I know it's not abandoned yet. https://twitter.com/Cronus_GH/status/829819314475765760

Good luck to the Devs - Grey Havens.
Kudos for keeping this game alive at the moment! | So here is the thing I am going to say my OPINION on this game. (I hope you read what is on caps :P)

Q:Is the game fun?
A:Yes, if you like to grind it is pretty fun and if you have friends to play it with you it will make the grind easier since your loot is ""shared"".

Q:How is the community?
A:I am not someone that can answer correctly that because I prefer to play solo instead with friends xD But from what I saw and interacted with I must say that the community is pretty good.

Q:I played a bit and saw almost no one, is it always like this?
A:Now, unfortunally, yes. When I played for the first time (2010 maybe) it had a lot of people.

Q:Is it pay to win?
A:No, not even close. You can convert 10k crowns(the game's currency) into energy(the paid currency).

Q:Why would I want the energy?
A:To not grind xD

TL;DR: Game is very grindy if you don't want to pay. Community pretty good but small. If you don't like to grind stay away. :)

PPlayed this game when first came out was great and loved the Pvp and didnt need to spend much money to be competative...
Now a total cash grab dont expect to be a great PvP setting without spending at least $1500 on gems artifacts and the whole lot to be anywhere near topp teir!
Real shame was a great game that has been totally ruined... sad to see what it has become stop being so greedy ARC! | WoW > Neverwinter > Любая корейская ММО
 Симулятор дейликов.  Дабы получить заветный 70 уровень и начать ходить в локации и данжи топ контента, приготовтесь часов 70-80 посвятить качу. Который состоит из 4 миссий, а именно: 
1) убей вражин (от 10 до !200!)
2) собери предметы (от 10 до !60!)
3) отнеси ящик (если повезет то один)
4) зачисть подземелье с боссом в конце 
 И эти миссии не будут даже чередоваться, вам могут 10 раз подрят дать задание кого то убить))
 На 70 же уровне, открывается самое интересное!! Дабы получить себе топ НЕ ДОНАТ шмотки ты должен продолжать делать свои любимые квесты каждый день)) За задания тебе уже не будут довать опыт, а начнут давать ""репутацию"" у торговцев этим самым шмотом) Дабы собрать все, вам придется играть месяцев 4-5 посвещая по 2-3 часа в день дейликам.
 Но не все так ужасно. На 70 уровне вы можете ходить в подземелья и фармить шмот там. Вы ведь качали паладина? Нет?! Так тут других классов просто не берут в данжи, потому что они на много слабее как по урону, так и захилу, о чем вы вообще думали?!
 Теперь про донат, ведь игра бесплатная, а это значит что платить нужно во время игры, а не перед. Он тут влияет на все, на скорость перемещения по карте, на то сколько опыта ты получишь, шмота и какой шмот. Размеры доната зубодробительные, премиум 1000р, сумка 500р, быстрый маунт от 500р.  Имеется возможность сразу купить себе шмот, или заточку оружия, вам гарантируется нагиб в любом пвп или пве (около 1000р за предмет) . На то что бы достич этого без доната вам понадобится 3-4 месяцев и всё твоё, а пока лучше тебе не ходить в пвп. А в данжи тебя и так не возьмут) 
 Итого мы имеем гриндилку. Вся игра будет заключаться в затыкивании врагов левой кнопкой мыши. Здесь нет скила, от вас не требуются некакие навыки (бой с любым боссом выглядит как постоянное выбегание из красного круга на земле) все что нужно для успеха- это куча времени на фарм мобов. | A disclaimer - it's a game set in Forgotten Realms universe, but don't expect DnD-like gameplay. 

Now what should I say about this game...
Neverwinter is a MMORPG, and a really good one. I was somewhat off for the first few hours, but the game gets better and better with every hour you spend in it. 

A disclaimer #2 - if you don't like timegate mechanic and grinding dailies don't read further.

Let's start with some pros:
+ Setting - I'm definitely a FR lover. You should know that Salvatore helped with writing some of the quests in the game. You will also meet some amazing characters like Bruenor Battlehamer, Drizzt Do'Urden or Minsc&Boo. 
+ Music - wether you're in the heart of Neverwinter, traverse the Underdark or purge the Dread Ring of the undead you'll always be accompanied by really nice tunes. It's an MMO so obviously music does not play THAT BIG of a role, but the tracks playing at the background do not disturb you.
+ Character development(bright part) - it's really well made. While power upgrading does not matter much, traits and boons can passively make your character stronger in different ways(for example make your trap also deal damage over time, and even stronger against immune targets)
+ Combat - you're basically on the move all the time, combat is dynamic, there is a lot of dodging, blocking and watching out for enemy attacks
+ Endgame - that is just my opinion but endgame is great. Dungeons are challenging(unless you get boosted by that 3k+ player), long, bossfights are fun. There is always something to do due to campaigns which not only give great rewards but boost your character stats via boons. Also progress is slow paced but significant enough to see the difference between those two items, 30-40 item levels or that one tier of your artifact. 

Cons
- Hard to earn currency - getting AD as a fresh player is a pain in the arse. Enough said. 
- AD to Zen converting ratio - Zen is that ""real money"" currency of NW. And while gathering AD to exchange for Vip(1k Zen - 500k AD) is not that big of an issue, trying to get AD to buy Zen while also managing your characters equipment is. Artifact here, refinement stones there, goodbye 120k AD here. 
- Outdated graphics - we're in 2017, yet graphics sometimes feel like a 2012 game. It doesn't look bad, it had actually aged quite well, but I think devs should consider making some upgrades here and there. 
- Character development (sad part) - boons from campaigns are a double edged sword. They greatly increase character capabilities, but good luck getting most of them. Some of them are after huge timegates(ToD, Dread Ring, Underdark) and others are just annoying to start with(Icewind Dale, fuck you).

My final mark would be somewhere around 7 or 8 out of 10. It's definitely a game worth at least trying out. | Fraichement arrivé niveau 70, il me semblait important de faire une évaluation de ce jeu auquel je n'attendais pas grand chose. En effet, j'ai appris la connaissance de ce jeu via un ami qui l'avait télécharché sur sa playsation 4. Je l'avais regardé joué quelques heures sans grand intêret étant encore en Juillet dernier sur World of Warcraft et Blade and Soul. Mais voilà, ayant démémangé aux Etats Unis, j'ai du arrêté Wow dût fait de mon temps de jeu qui ne serait pas assez important pour pouvoir accomplir ce que je voulais.

Je me suis donc mis à la recherche d'un nouveau jeu qui pourrait occuper mes temps de loisirs, mais ou l'exigence serait revu à la baisse, afin que cela corresponde mieu à mon nouveau style de vie.

Après avoir essayé, Wildstar, SWORT, Lotro et j'en passe, je n'avais pas été du tout convaincu, pas tant par la qualité du jeu, mais pour encore son modèle qui ne me correspondait pas. 

Par tout hasard, je décide de télécharger Neverwinter, afin de voir ce que cela donne, et je suis actuellement lvl 70, et je ne compte pas arrêté de si tôt.

Les points positifs:

1) Races : Tout d'abord Neverwinter m'a plus dès le début pour ses races que l'on a à disposition. Je l'ai trouve plutôt varié et bien adapté à l'univers héroique fantaisy. La personnalisation est très correct, je dirais au dessus de la moyenne actuelle, et permet de differencier son personnage des autres joueurs. 

2) Les Graphismes: ayant plutôt une belle marchine, je peux facilement faire tourner Neverwinter à fond, et je trouve les graphismes très satisfaisant. Dans un MMORPG, des graphismes de dingues à la Gear of War sont pour ma part obsolètes, une pâte artistique est bien plus pertinent. Je retrouve un mélange de Lotro et World of Warcraft qui est très appréciable.

3) Le gameplay: Je trouve le gampelay très bien fini et surtout très accessible. Avec une dynamique à la Tera, Neverwinter propose un style de jeu plutôt bourrin qui change des habitudes. En revanche, le nombre de compétences est limitées, de ce fait le gameplay ne demande pas une haute exigence, et sera plutôt accessible à la majorité des joueurs. 

4) Le monde instancié et cloisoné: Alors oui, pour beaucoup, cet aspect serait un défaut, mais pour moi c'est plutôt un +. En effet, même si l'immersion est un peu mis à mal avec ce système, je trouve que cela permet de gagner du temps, chose que j'ai besoin au vu de mon planning.

5) La personalisation : Il y a beaucoup de moyen de personnaliser son personnage via les talents, atouts, caractéristiques et pouvoirs, afin de vraiment crée un personnage unique.

6) La boutique : Je trouve la boutique très bien faite, et permet aux joueurs qui n'ont pas un grand temps de jeu, de leur rendre la vie plus confortable et de gagner du temps. Je ne suis pas du tout contre ce genre de pratique, tant que cela ne devient pas trop Pay to Win. Après pour les gens qui ne veulent pas payer, ils pourront exactement arriver au même résultat, mais en prenant surement plus de temps. 
Après il faut pas rêver, la gratuité réèlle n'existe pas dans notre monde, et mettre 50 euros dans un jeu n'est pas non plus la mort, quand on connait le prix d'un paquet de cigarrette.

Les points négatifs : 

1) Le Lore : j'ai été assez décu par l'histoire générale du jeu, qui pour moi ne donne pas l'impression d'être réèllement impliqué dans quelque chose d'important. Peut être que cela s'améliorera au fils des futures campagne, mais pour l'instant l'envi de lire soigneusement les quêtes n'est pas encore arrivée.

2) Répétivité des quêtes : Courant dans la plupart des MMORPG, chaque donneur de quêtes va toujours vous trouver un escuse pour que vous alliez basher du mob. Cela devient un peu agaçant à force. La variété des quêtes est selon moi pas assez prononcé. En revanche le doublage est de bonne facture que cela soit en Français ou en Anglais.

3) La musique : La musique n'est pas très prenante, et ne favorise pas l'immersion dans le jeu et son côté épique. 

4) Variété des maps: Je trouve quelques fois une certaine redondance des maps, surtout celles des donjons qui semblent toujours être plus ou moins pareil.

Conclusion:

De mon point de vu, Neverwinter est un MMORPG de qualité, et n'a rien à envier à ses conccurents actuels. Il ravira les personnes qui ont des exigences plus basse que la moyenne en terme d'investissment et qui veulent plus prendre du fun que d'avoir le meilleur dps du jeu. 
Je pense que Cryptic à réussi le pari de la stratégie ""bleu océan"" qui consiste à capter une nouvelle catégorie de joueurs qui n'étaient pas interessé par les MMORPG auparavant ou qui veule moins se prendre la tête.s 
C'est pourquoi, Neverwinter se trouve dans une bonne situation financière et va perdurer dans le temps, car il ne cherche pas à conccurencer directement les mmo déjà bien installés dans le marché contrairement à un Wildstar qui n'a pas pu trouvé sa place et qui brûle à petit feu. 

Voilà,

Merci pour la lecture !

I started like 12867 years ago when it came out on Kongregate and it was awesome! Wild Shadow did everything perfect with this game.  Then Kabam bought them out and turned it into more of a pay to win.  Kabam did some good, but mostly bad.  They owned Realm for a long time, but very recently a company called DECA bought it from Kabam.  DECA has been incredible in my opinion.  They have released more updates in two months than Kabam did in 5 years.  New things and skins and map changes, it's exactly whatneeded to happen.  So, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants to play it right now.  About 6 months ago I would've said not to bother.  I just hope DECA keeps with it | 10/10

76561197999259031,212500,The Lord of the Rings Online™,0.15,"Action, Adventure, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Free To Play",0,"2023 Update:

First major concern a lot of people have about LOTRO - is it dead?

(Still) No. It still has a very healthy playerbase, big enough that the even the RP servers feel populated. So don't let your worries about population turn you away. The numbers online are not always accurate, so I'd be wary of trusting outside reporting.

This is a classic MMORPG. It's going to be familiar to anyone that has played Everquest, DAoC, WoW, etc. While it means you're not getting any particularly amazing new mechanics, the perk is that LOTRO has figured out how to get the best out of those systems. Leveling feels well-progressed, classes are (mostly) balanced, and there is a lot of variety even within the classes to provide lots of replay value and ways to mitigate strengths and weaknesses.

LOTRO might have the best soundtrack I've ever heard. I recommend turning off battle music and just enjoying the compositions. Bree, as well as the various Inns and Halls located therein, have some fantastic scores attached to them.

Let's be honest though - if you play LOTRO you're probably here because it's Lord of the Rings. And in that regard, you will not be disappointed. The game is steeped in the lore - books and films - and has little nods to it scattered everywhere that are rewarding for someone that is really into their Tolkien scholarship. This is not a LotR skin thrown over a MMORPG framework - this is Middle Earth proper. Even with dated graphics (updates are coming soon, as of this writing) it's still a joy to look at. If you're rolling through some place like the Shire, you'll be able to soak in that sleepy, bucolic atmosphere that the movies portrayed so well.

This is a great MMO experience, and I usually find MMOs tedious. Moreover, it's free - so it's a low-commit to try it out for yourself. | 国服老玩家开服玩到关服，爷的青春，关服后这些年前前后后下了三次美服又被英语和加速器劝退。

The game is amazing, It looks stunning for a game that came out when it did and the newer areas show the love the developers have put into the game, I dont use the steam client though because it has caused me some issues.

PROS:
[list]
[*] Follows LOTR lore almost perfectly
[*] Classes are varied
[*] Community is always friendly
[*] THE MUSIC SYSTEM! Its so good. You can either play by hand or use .abc & .midi files to play instruments in game!
[/list]

CONS:
[list]
[*] Quests are boring if you dont read the quest text, They seem to have no point unless you dive into the story
[*] Difficult to start if your not a ""VIP"" member. Dont let this put you off! you can get everything legitimatley without paying a dime!
[/list] | 1) Сюжет - огромный, полный смысла, последовательный и увлекательный, кропотливо перенесенный разработчиками в игру из книг Толкиена. Так хочется уже отдохнуть от гриндилок и просто спасать мир :)
2) Атмосфера - сочетание музыки и графики, хоть и слегка устаревшей, но тем не менее есть ощущение погружения в мир Средиземья. 
3) Не надо никуда спешить, апать гир и лвл, можно неторопливо, с толком чувством и расстановкой играть в свое удовольствие на любом уровне.
Эта игра как хороший старый друг - можно не играть длительное время, но всегда приятно возвращаться :) | [b]UPDATE 07.07.17: HdRO läuft bei mir immer noch optimal.

Eingeschränkte F2P Empfehluing.
Für Gelegenheitsspieler ist das bezahlen der einzelnen Aufgabenpacks eine gute Variante, statt nach Ablauf des Abos, alles gesperrt zu haben. Ist jetzt nicht viel billiger, aber wieso Abo zahlen, wenn man nur alle paar Tage mal spielt.

Für jeden Herr der Ringe / Hobbit Fan ein geniales Spiel, mit einer der schönsten Spielwelten/-Atmosphäre überhaupt![/b]

[b]Habe HdRO schon Retail mit mehr als 1000Std gespielt.[/b]
HdRO war und ist ein großartiges MMO.
Gerade HdR Fans können sich hier Jahre lang vergessen.

Aber!
Es ist nur bis lvl30 F2P, danach Abo oder alles einzelnd kaufen.
Ihr müßt Geld ausgeben, also rechnet euch das vorher gut durch.

Und jetzt kommt das absolut Schlimmste, was für viele zutrifft, bei anderen läuft das Spiel bestens.
Der Client ist derartig beschissen, es ist kaum in Wort zu fassen.
Wenn ihr das Spiel installiert, wird euch auffallen, das erstmal DirectX9 installiert wird.
Richtig. Es ist immer noch der alte Client, wo man einfach über die Jahre alle Erweiterungen und DirectX11 drauf geklatscht hat. Und somit verkommt das Spielen zu einem Glücksspiel, wann und wie es abstürzt. 
Whitescreen, Blackscreen, Bluescreen, gar Greenscreen, natürlich die üblichen Crash to Desktops, Freezes, Lags etc.
Bei mir läuft es jetzt wieder super, aber auch nur auf dem Laptop...

Das Spiel selber ist wirklich old-school und einfach nur perfekt für jeden HdR Fan.
Aber es ist halt auch ne Menge Glück nötig, dass das Spiel läuft."

2/18/2017 Edit: Some of my outfit/platoon mates gave me some ideas as to what to put for the 10 things as I could only think of about 4 on my own :P 
So thanks to them to make this review entirely possible!

3/1/2017 Edit 2: a few more tips for you are   
1) dont run infront of your allies that are shooting, go behind them so you stay out of their line of fire.   
2) use the terain around you for cover.  
3) if your a Heavy Assault turn you shield on when entering cover, even if your not being shot at. reason is this is a CLIENT side game if you can see them, you can shoot them. so if your in cover they may still see you out of cover for a short time after because they havent recieved the info from you yet. so use the addage of ""I can see you, I can shoot you"" the same goes for the other players aswell   
4) Don't go straight for the enemy UNLESS you have several teamates with you. Try your BEST to FLANK the enemy. don't attack them head on. come at them from the sides, above, or even behind them, if one tactic dosen't work... Try something else. the fight is dynamic, just like you!  5) Finally, LEARN the strengths and weaknesses of your weapons, it WILL take time.


P.S. Feel free to add my on steam or PS2 (ingame) the name i listed is my primary although if you want i can tell you the others via PM or steam chat.

P.P.S. I added some tips my teamates and friends gave me. some others on Youtube, like Wrel (Dev) Nico101, Joshino, and others have also said some of these tips. If you want to know more about the game look them up on youtube Especially Wrel, as he's a developer. Nico101 I'd recoment to Older audiences, as there is some ""Humor"" that younger audiences may find offensive or dont understand. (he and his team swear a bit aswell) i do squad ops with them and its mostly moments of WTF?! and general fun. Joshino and Wrel are a great choice to see if you want to Learn more about the game, its mechanics and also for general info/guides for weapons or tactics. 

Now all this is simply my PERSONAL opinion, while i agree that some others may not agree with me, i hold my opinions of the game and the players in fair judgment.

      Planetside 2 is an online tactical shooter in which you choose to be a soldier in one of three different factions that are involved in an eternal struggle for various planets. Each faction must capture control points in order to gain control of the planet. There are 6 different soldier classes which allow for large differences in personal gameplay. Give it a try because it is free.

This is war. 

Battles with hundreds of people fighting on each side in Combined arms battles with air and land vehicles across maps that are more than 100 square kilometres. Grab your 980ti and hold on tight, because you're in for a treat. | #Pros and cons#
Epic, unique, one of a kind. It's 2017 and still no game like this one.
A war, vast worlds, playground, massive battles (and also opposite), variety, tactical, outstanding.
A war, free2play but no child's playground.
Well in a chaotic massive battle everyone could find his role and spot......
Teamwork, lone wolf, support, scout, infiltrator, cloaked bugger, jetpack flank warrior, mechwarrior, tank force, air force, gatherer...
Unforgiving, complex and overcomplicated.
Outstanding deep ballistics.

Very very slow progress to unlock this and upgrade that, add these and fully uncap those. 
Grind or die, grind to win, play or pay. 
Anyway time is money. Free2play can turn into the most expensive game by far, by far. No respecs, no refunds.
Brainer. One way or another?
Yea, teamwork, leadership and tactics, that's what matters, 
well you will be facing the most equipped warriors and platoons over n over, also you will be swarmed...,
and well the factions and powers are kinda unbalanced and varied on purpose here and there, 
so you will be facing some OP sh1t over n over. A war.
Well yea mostly everything has a downside. Challenge, outsmart, tactics.
One faction population decrease, the faction can be outnumbered. A swarm. Depending on server, can happen often.
Limited numbers, sometimes queues to one world. At least playing underpopulated faction kinda prevents you from queues. Membership has priority. 

#Honorable mentions#
CPU demanding (average GPU is enough).
Dont expect 120+++ FPS, stable FPS
Beside ingame, you can edit config file for performance, visual clarity, FOV, etc.
Stuck in queue? Just try reenter the queue or ""Join Combat"" button every 1-2mins, should help. | 汉化作者已经回归并且放出最新版本更新

Im Kern haben wir hier ein rundenbasiertes Arena-Taktikspiel vor uns. So schön auch Banner Saga ist, hier kommt nicht wirklich Stimmung auf. Das eigentliche Spiel lebt von seiner tollen Geschichte, die aber hier keine Wirkung entfaltet. Wir dreschen uns einfach mit ähnlichen Gruppen herum. Das zieht sich teilweise erheblich. Hauptproblem sind letztlich aber die kaum vorhandenen Mitspieler. Schade das man nicht auf die Idee kam auch Koop-PvE und Bots als Ersatz für menschliche Gegner für PvP einzufügen. Das hätte dem Spiel gut getan. So ist das Spiel letztlich eine Art Demo-Version für die Kämpfe von Banner Saga.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBYxV-1eFKU | The Banner Saga: Factions revolves around the first part of the banner saga story, in which you are permanently stuck inside one area of the story, fighting battles in a bar against others in a multiplayer tactics game. This game has a ton of potential to grow, and can be very prominent as a game. However, the fact that it is not original in itself compared to the actual banner saga game, and the fact that no one is able to play the game, as there is no one to play against in this multiplayer only game, makes this game a little less than promising. I would not waste time on this until the developers work on the game to increase popularity, through advertising or working on the game's content, of which it is lacking, if at all.

76561197999259031,230410,Warframe,65.53333333333333,"Action, RPG, Free To Play",83,"Warframe is a game that rewards you for the amount of time that you invest into it. If you wish for a surface level horde shooter with fun abilities then it will give you that experience in spades, however, it also has the ability to allow you to delve deeper into its systems and lets you customize and maximize your arsenal until you become a walking army.

The story is serviceable in the beginning but in my opinion ages like wine as you progress through the star chart, slowly pulling you into an experience that I have yet to relive in any other Sci-Fi game I've played. While it does go off the rails at times it does so in a way that feels believable and maintains a sense of internal consistency that keeps you informed while still asking questions.

Each frame feels unique even though the devs have released over 50 differing characters, each with a unique kit that (while falling into a manageable amount of categories such as caster vs weapons-platform) still allows players to express their own uniqueness through their selection of frames and weapons. It is rare that any two players' loadouts will be identical to one another.

It is definitely a game I recommend everyone to play at least once and one I definitely recommend to anyone who loves long grinds, deep (though sometimes confusing) mechanical systems, and extreme horde shooters. | Better Destiny"

76561197999259031,238960,Path of Exile,111.9,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Free To Play",34,"Path of Exile (POE) não é um MMORPG, como a maioria o classifica. POE é, na verdade, um action-RPG online. Você não tem necessariamente que interagir com outros jogadores se não o quiser, e mesmo que o queira, sua interação é limitada apenas a um chat global e a alguns poucos (5) jogadores que você, por ventura, permita que entrem em sua equipe (party).

Considerado o sucessor verdadeiro do Diablo II pelos mais saudosistas, Path of Exile é um jogo bastante interessante para quem gosta de RPGs hack-and-slash com uma grande gama de possibilidades em suas builds. Com uma árvore de habilidades de mais de 1300 pontos diferentes além de um complexo sistema de crafting, cada personagem torna-se único em seu potencial, apesar de, no momento, não ter tantas possibilidades de customização visual.

Após mais de 4000 horas jogadas, sinto-me confiante que posso dar o verdadeiro valor ao jogo nessa análise sem, no entanto, deixar de considerar seus pontos fracos. Por isso, vamos por partes:

[h1]Conceito e Existência[/h1]
Path of Exile é um jogo que foi desenvolvido desde seu início para dar aos saudosistas jogadores de Diablo II um ar de renovação. Chris Wilson, o líder do projeto, e seus companheiros fundaram uma empresa chamada Grinding Gear Games, a atual responsável pelo gerenciamento do jogo, e decidiram dedicar-se exclusivamente ao desenvolvimento de POE.

Seguindo o modelo original de Diablo II, o Path of Exile tem point-of-view semelhante, embora com gráficos melhores e atualizados para uma nova geração (inclusive, recentemente, recebendo suporte a DirectX 11 e algumas funcionalidades exclusivas deste), além de conter o mesmo 'feeling' de grinding que tanto tornou Diablo II famoso.

[h1]Jogabilidade[/h1]
Com uma árvore de habilidades de mais de 1300 opções, além de 6 raças iniciais, POE tem uma jogabilidade altamente imersível e de grande liberdade aos jogadores. Ao criar um personagem, você tem uma série de quests que devem ser seguidas sob uma história modelo, dividida em dez atos e em duas partes. Ao finalizar a primeira parte da história, você parte para a segunda, com uma dificuldade maior, já que você recebe algumas penalidades.

Terminada a parte da história e com seu personagem por volta do level 60 (level 100 sendo o máximo), você parte então para o conteúdo end-game do jogo, que consiste, na maior parte do tempo, 'rodar' mapas (mais de 100 tipos diferentes) em dificuldades diferentes em busca de mais level e/ou itens raros e ajudar Zana, uma NPC, na guerra do atlas. É aí que o grinding se torna interessante para pessoas que gostam (como eu). Para as que não gostam, você pode simplesmente começar de novo se quiser e tentar novas e divertidas builds.

Para se ter uma ideia dos níveis de grinding do jogo, estima-se que a possibilidade de dropar um dos itens mais raros do jogo (Espelho de Kalandra) seja de uma vez a cada dez anos se você jogar cerca de 4 horas por dia. É bastante, de fato, mas seu alto valor no jogo faz com que todos sonhem com a possibilidade de tornarem-se ricos da noite pro dia.

Os servidores são divididos em ligas. Há a liga permanente softcore e a permanente hardcore. A diferença entre uma e outra consiste no fato de que, se você morrer com seu personagem na liga hardcore, ele será automaticamente transferido para a liga softcore (ao contrário de Diablo, onde você perde o personagem).

Há também as ligas temporárias, normalmente lançadas a cada 2 ou 3 meses. Elas oferecem um ""fresh start"", ou seja, um início fresco para aqueles que não querem se submeter à inflacionada economia das ligas permanentes ou simplesmente desejam tentar se perpetuarem como ricos comerciantes ou crafters de itens nas novas ligas. Note que, ao final de cada liga, seus personagens lá localizados, bem como o baú da sua conta, serão transferidos para as ligas permanentes.

[h1]Gráficos[/h1]
Além do que pode se ver nas próprias imagens, Path of Exile não é um jogo que possa se dizer ser muito voltado ao desenvolvimento de belos gráficos. Os gráficos são sim medianos, mas mantém-se sempre atualizados com o que há de moderno no mundo dos jogos. Há cerca de um ano, como já mencionado, o jogo recebeu suporte a DirectX 11, além de alguns efeitos especiais a mais (como o movimento responsivo de capas e asas de personagens a skills ou até mesmo o vento). Na mesma época o jogo também recebeu portabilidade para o Xbox.

Sua customização visual também não é muito rica (por enquanto), sendo você, na maior parte do tempo, obrigado a ficar preso ao visual de seus itens e de sua raça (não há diferença de sexos, por exemplo - se você escolher raça X onde o personagem é, por padrão, feminino, ele continuará sendo feminino). Toda e qualquer customização visual não padrão, ou seja, que não é próprio do item que você esteja usando, é paga. A única exceção são as recompensas fornecidas no final de cada liga. Apesar disso, no último ano, a GGG tem investido bastante nesse quesito, com uma notável melhora.

O jogo tem atenção exclusiva da Grinding Gear Games, sua empresa gerenciadora. Com um início difícil de 5 funcionários, ela hoje conta com mais de 150 pessoas em dedicação exclusiva, fazendo com que seu suporte seja um dos mais efetivos que eu já tenha visto (enviei cerca de 10 a 15 tickets e a média de tempo para resposta deles foi de 5 minutos - é incrível).

[h1]Comunidade[/h1]
Você pode escolher interagir com a comunidade ou não. Esse é o principal fator que faz com que Path of Exile não seja, per-se, um MMORPG, onde, por definição, você é obrigado a interagir com um universo de jogadores. No geral, a comunidade de Path of Exile é bastante amigável e disposta a ajudar, mas, como em todo jogo, há bastantes trolls e, principalmente, scammers.

O [i]scam[/i] é legalizado no jogo desde que não seja através de transações da vida real (ou RMT - do inglês, [i]real money trading[/i]). De acordo com o próprio Chris Wilson, a empresa tenta não realizar nenhum tipo de regulação do mercado dentro do jogo, logo cabe a cada jogador tomar conta de seus itens e analisar seu devido valor antes de se desfazer dele para outro jogador. Ainda segundo ele, no jogo, [i]'knowledge is power, and power is everything'[/i] (conhecimento é poder, e poder é tudo).

No começo, não foram poucas as vezes que fui enganado por jogadores mais experientes, comprando a preço de banana mercadorias que poderiam valer bem mais caso eu soubesse seu devido valor, por isso recomendo cautela a jogadores novatos.

[h1]Pay-to-win?[/h1]
[b]Não.[/b] Não há sequer um fator que possa ser considerado pay-to-win em todo o jogo. Tudo que é adquirido por dinheiro real é por mero conceito de embelezamento e/ou [i]status quo[/i]. O único fator que possa ser considerado pay-to-win para alguns jogadores (eu não considero, no entanto) é o fato de que, ao criar uma nova conta, você recebe gratuitamente 3 abas no baú e para adquirir mais abas você deve dispor de dinheiro real.

No entanto, é bem comum o conceito de [i]mules[/i] no jogo, onde você cria vários personagens (você pode criar mais de 20 ao todo) para guardar itens dentro de seus inventários, o que não faz com que seja um fator limitante aos jogadores que não desejam pagar por conteúdo dentro do jogo.

[h1]Conclusão[/h1]
Path of Exile é uma obra-prima dos action-RPGs onlines. Sem dúvida o melhor do gênero, com a melhor companhia de jogos existente da atualidade em sua direção, mas eu, obviamente, sou suspeito a falar, já que ""desperdicei"" (e com orgulho) mais de 3000 horas da minha vida no jogo. Se você gosta de jogos com bastante [i]grinding[/i] e com uma grande gama de possibilidades de ações, sugiro que teste Path of Exile.

[h1]Nota: 9.5/10[/h1]
Pontos positivos:
[+] Grinding complexo
[+] Grande gama de possibilidades
[+] Árvore de habilidades com mais de 1300 opções
[+] Ligas que oferecem um começo igual a todos

Pontos negativos:
[-] Baixa gama de customização visual (mas que tem melhorado no último ano) | Yoa so nach knapp 4k std. Spielzeit kann ich wohl mal ein Review verfassen :P.

F2P oder P2W ? => Es ist wirklich F2P, man kann alle Charaktäre Fähigkeiten etc verwenden und ausspielen, es gibt kein EXP Boost oder ähnliches.

Wie finanziert sich die Firma hinter dem Spiel ? => MTX ähnlich wie in Dota gibt es Armor, Waffen und Fähigkeits ""Skins"" welche das Spiel selber aber nicht beeinflussen. 

Also muss man kein Geld ausgeben ? 
=> Jaein xD, wenn man sehr viel spielt und einem das Spiel nun wirklich gefällt sollte man seinen Stash(Truhe) erweitern, hier nimmt man dann mal 20€ in die Hand (wenn dir dieses Spiel keine 20€ wert ist dann lass es halt ^^), für dieses Spiel allerdings noch zu wenig bei dem was es dir bietet. 
Ich persönlich spiel das Spiel seit der closed Beta(2013) und habe zu jedem kostenlosen DLC ( ein DLC bietet ca so viel Umfang wie Diablo III insgesamt, es gibt bereits 5 DLC´s) der Firma GrindingGearGames etwas Geld zukommen lassen und hab mir davon Stash Erweiterungen und Skins gekauft.

Ist es Einsteiger freundlich ? 
=> Auch hier ein Jaein, wer bereits viele Action RPG`s gezockt hat wird etwas schneller ins Spiel finden, wer keine Erfahrungen hat wird es sehr schwer haben aber gut Ding will Weile haben :P.
Also einfach Google nutzen und man wird schnell merken das die PoE Community ins gesamt nett und freundlich ist und es gibt ne menge Anfänger guides von größeren Streamern. Hier und da sollte man also bei Twitch.tv sich Builds in Action ansehen oder im Forum einen Build heraussuchen ;).
Und lasst euch nicht vom Skill Baum abschrecken, man wird diesen lieben wenn man das Spiel mehr und mehr versteht, genau dieser bietet einen unglaubliche Freiheiten seinen Charakter einzigartig zu machen und evtl. einen wirklich guten Build zu erstellen.

Ist es auf deutsch spielbar ?
=> JA!!!!, es ist nun möglich es auf DEUTSCH zu stellen !!!!! ;-)  

Diablo III oder POE ?
=> Ich spiele beides, aber PoE bietet sag ich mal 10x so viel und ist F2P , auch grafisch mag ich PoE mehr da es düsterer, brutaler und gnadenloser ist.

Gibt es einen Harcore Modus ?
=> Ja, der gestorbene Charakter landet in Sofcore. Anders als in Diablo III gibt es keine passive Fähigkeit die dich retten kann.

Ist die Story gut erzählt ?
=>Nein, keine tollen Videos und auch kaum Vertonung, der Fokus lag wie es richtig ist, auf dem Gameplay, aber mitlerweile wird mehr und mehr vertont und nachgebessert.

Gibt es ein Late-Game ?
=> Ja und zwar ein absolut geaniales Late-Game !, mit lvl 60 ist man ca. fertig mit der Story welche man 3mal durchpielt (Normal,Cruel,Merciless), nach einiger Erfahrung geht das ziemlich schnell. Im Late-Game läuft man Maps welche durch Portale geöffnet werden und zufällig generiert werden, der Name der Map gibt einem Info darüber wie das Layout ca aussehen wird und welcher Boss auf einem wartet, auch hier die PoE wiki nutzen oder Ytube Videos schauen wie der Boss Fight ablaufen wird.

Gibt es einen Trade Markt wo Spieler untereinander handeln ?
=> JA, es gibt kein Gold oder ähnliches, im Spiel findet man Orbs welche zu Iteam craften genutzt werden können oder auch als Währung, dabei sind diese aufgrund ihrer verschiedenen Seltenheit unterschiedlich viel Wert, am Ende ist es ehher ein tausch System, ich gebe dir ``x`` von und du gibst mir deine Armor.
 
Am Ende kann ich nur sagen das es sich hier um ein Spiel handelt, für welches man viel Zeit haben sollte, der Anfang wird sehr schwer sein da es sehr viele Meschaniken gibt, wenn du also ein Spiel suchst an dem du dich messen kannst und dich frei entwickeln kannst bist du bei PoE genau richtig.

Hier noch ein paar links zu Seiten dich euch sicher weiter helfen werden ;)

http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Path_of_Exile_Wiki <-- Wiki

http://www.pathofexile.com/forum <--- zum Build heraus suchen unter Classes / Builds

www.twitch.tv <--- hier einfach mal Builds live in Action anschauen und evtl Leute im Chat um Hilfe bitten, wie gesagt ist der große Teil der Community sehr nett, liegt vermutlich daran das es nicht competitive ist ^^.

MfG Schlomo und viel Spaß beim spielen !!!! | La verdad es que era bastante reticente a probar este juego. En primer lugar, no me gustan los ""free2play"". Suelen acabar en ""pay 2 win"", comunidades tóxicas, DLCs sospechosamente obligatorios, y una calidad general bastante baja. Además, tengo todos los Diablo comprados, desde el I al III con todas sus expansiones. Teniendo el original, ¿para que jugar a un clon? 

Pues Path of Exile me ha sorprendido. 

En primer lugar, en la tienda del juego sólo venden objetos cosméticos, espacio de almacenamiento, y packs de soporte. Nada que afecte al desarrollo del personaje o al poder de los objetos.

En cuanto al desarrollo del personaje, el juego tiene 19 clases de partida. Pero no son clases cerradas, sino más bien ""zonas de inicio"" que puedes desarrollar a través de un árbol con cientos (literalmente) de skills pasivos. 

Tiene mucho contenido, diez actos. Muchas misiones secundarias, aleatorias, y tramas paralelas (maestros, refugio, etc...). Cada cierto tiempo abren una liga, en la que todos los jugadores empiezan de cero y hay algún evento específico.

La ambientación del mundo es muy siniestra, a ratos realmente gore. Me gusta la historia. Gráficamente no están mal, aunque no está a la altura de Diablo. 

El sistema de juego está lleno de buenas ideas. Por ejemplo, no hay habilidades activas, se consiguen a través de gemas que se engarzan en el equipo. Las gemas pueden subirse de nivel, y hasta hay gemas de soporte que potencian el efecto de otras gemas. 

Hay pociones, como en Diablo 2, pero se rellenan solas cuando matas enemigos, no tienes que llevar 500 pociones en el inventario.

Sistema de crafting básico y avanzado. Se pueden mejorar y alterar los objetos, reforjar estadísticas, etc...

En resumen, un ARPG hardcore, con una curva de aprendizaje un poco bestia al principio, pero con muchísimas posibilidades. Encima gratis y sin pay2win. No sé que más se puede pedir. | 
[h1]Seja bem-vindo, exilado![/h1]


Path of Exile é um RPG de ação 3D publicado pela Grinding Gear Games. Semelhante a jogos como Diablo e Torchlight, Path of Exile permite aos jogadores explorar vários calabouços (dungeons) nas formas de história ""Atos"". Os jogadores têm uma grande variedade de classes iniciais para escolher, mas cada classe serve apenas como o ponto de partida inicial para a progressão do personagem de um jogador.

Os jogadores têm a sua disponibilidade uma enorme quantidade de gemas (skill gems) e opções passivas da skill tree. As gemas podem ser encaixadas no equipamento do personagem e concedem uma escala larga das habilidades, que dependem do tipo e da cor da gema. As gemas podem até subir de nível para fornecer uma versão mais forte da skill. A árvore de habilidades é um conjunto vasto e complexo de combinações de skills passivas. Cada jogador pode escolher entre uma enorme variedade de alocações pontuais para realmente personalizar a sua classe de personagens.

Path of Exile apresenta tanto PvE e PvP com eventos como corridas de nivelamento que ocorrem em servidores dedicados. Outras variações incluem um modo Cut-Throat, onde os jogadores podem invadir instâncias de outros jogadores e matá-los para levar seus itens. Cada evento pode durar de apenas uma hora a vários meses e premiar valiosos prêmios para os vencedores. Os fãs da mecânica de rastreamento de dungeons (*dungeon crawling) mais tradicionais encontrados no Diablo 2 devem definitivamente dar uma chance ao Path of Exile.

*Sistema [b]dungeon crawling[/b]:

O sistema de [b]dungeon crawling[/b] é um tipo de cenário em jogos de role-playing de fantasia em que os heróis navegam em um ambiente labiríntico, lutando contra vários monstros e saqueando qualquer tesouro que possam encontrar. Devido à sua simplicidade, o dungeon crawling pode ser mais fácil para um *gamemaster executar do que aventuras mais complexas, e o estilo de ""hack and slash"" é apreciado por jogadores que se concentram em ação e combate.

*Um [b]gamemaster[/b] ( GM , também conhecido como mestre de jogo , gerente de jogo , moderador de jogo ou árbitro ) é uma pessoa que atua como um organizador, oficiante para perguntas sobre regras, arbitragem para um jogo de RPG multiplayer .Eles são mais comuns em jogos cooperativos em que os jogadores trabalham juntos do que em jogos competitivos em que os jogadores se opõem uns aos outros. O ato realizado por um gamemaster é às vezes referido como ""Gamemastering"" ou simplesmente ""GM-ing"".
O papel básico do gamemaster é o mesmo em quase todos os jogos tradicionais de role-playing, embora diferentes conjuntos de regras tornam os deveres específicos do gamemaster exclusivo para esse sistema.

[b]Prós:[/b]

-Bons gráficos que trabalham mesmo em PCs low-end, efeitos sonoros de alta fidelidade.
-Boa história
-Ambientação e efeitos bem elaborados, ótimo final.
-Totalmente free to play.
-Se você decidir investir dinheiro, todos os preços estão bem equilibrados.
-Muitos itens
-Cópia fiel ao Diablo 2
-Skill tree avançada 

[b]Contras:[/b]

-Alguns problemas de atraso e desconexões aleatórias, Não posso dizer que é perfeito, mas eu jogo tranquilamente com ping bem baixo. Porém, vejo algumas pessoas com problemas de vez em quando.
-Pontos de controle são muito distantes, por esse motivo o jogador tem que correr para o objetivo com a necessidade de perder alguns minutos em vez de usar o teleporte para checkpoints, que são muito longes do objetivo da missão.
- Customizaçao de personagens.


Lendo o site ficou claro que foi produzido de fã para fãs, devido a frases como:

[i] - ""Totalmente gratuito e nunca será pay to win""
- ""Estamos cansados da moda de fadas e luzes, Path Of Exile é realístico e escuro""[/i] 
E muitas outras...

Path Of Exile está de parabéns e merece respeito já por isto, recomendo para jogadores assíduos e que veneram o estilo Old School.


[b]Nota final 8/10.[/b]

 | Первый обзор, постараюсь кратко и со смыслом.

Отличный аналог Диабло, не могу сказать что он лучше или хуже, но для проекта, который создавался на минимум бюджета, оооочень недурственно. 
  Из плюсов: 
- Очень улыбнула графика. Она выдержана в своем стиле, сразу переносишься во времена Diablo2, когда было все ради фана и атмосферы.
- Для небольшого количества героев, просто огромный выбор классов. Благодаря системе развития пассивных навыков, это просто надо увидеть и попробовать, лично я остался под огромным впечатлением. Можно конечно канониченых магов, лучников и варов делать, но так же невесело. +)
- Понравился сюжетный режим. Несомненный плюс в прохождении с друзьями, опять таки за счет того, что билды героев нестандартны и очень вариотивны. Можно творить все, что вздумается, а это большая редкость для РПГ.
- Система активных скилов и крафта выполнена на высоте. Аналогов я просто не встречал, просто один раз попробовать и самому увидеть лучше, чем сто раз прочитать любой из обзоров.
  Из минусов:
- Лично для меня из минусов стала мини карта и ее большой брат, очень тускло, постоянно режет глаза. Но на это можно забить большой болт. Лично мое мнение.
- Есть еще один момент, касаемо новичков. Придется много читать статей и гайдов по героям, ибо настает момент, когда Вы попросту можете дальше не пройти из-за своего билда, нестандартаня раскачка весло, но может стать занозой в ягодной части при прохождении в соло. Опять таки может это у меня руки кривые, а у Вас все получится. +)

По итогу. В PoE обязательно стоит попробовать полиграть всем ценителям РПГ жанра, я уверяю тебя уважаемый читатель, равнодушным проект не оставит, хоть сначала может показаться странным и тяжеловатым. Но. Оно того определенно стоит. Ни разу не пожалел проведенного времени, жаль мало набегал, ибо все время свободное отнимает КС.
10 из 10 тысяч вариантов пасивок!!! Одобренно!!! +)"

76561197999259031,214420,Gear Up,2.4,"Action, Free To Play, Indie",9,"What a shame. Although it isn't a very good game for today's standards, I think I can safely say most people enjoyed playing it back then. There was a unique concept within Gear Up and a truly special experience created. It had a lot of potential, and could've been something amazing. [i] *queue the VSauce music* [/i] But it wasn't and it died off... why is that? 

Well from the start of it's release it was a finished product. Nothing new or exciting happened at all afterwards. Having a multiplayer game finished straight out of the gates isn't inherently a problem, as games like CS:GO and TF2 have proven to stand against the test of time unchanged. What do these have that Gear Up doesn't? Obviously they're backed up by a massive corporation that everybody using steam knows(Valve), where as Gear Up is from Doctor Entertainment, a company almost nobody has ever heard of. Why would this matter; many small businesses game developers have proven to be successful. The problem is with an action packed multiplayer game, the fanbase is going to explode, requiring constant updates and support. If there are no preparations for that, it's going to crash. Unbalanced games with no signs of updating just simply cannot support it. 

Games like CS:GO and TF2 work because the people running it can provide the support needed for an exponentially growing community, and Gear Up simply can't. On top of that there's pay to win features in Gear Up which unlock everything instantaneously, ruining the quirky game progression of buying random parts and testing which ones you like. This causes many to lose interest easily, as you can buy an overpowered combination and everything you were working for in the game is gone. Many games have fallen victim to P2W, Gear Up is no different, but it's sad to see it fall under the pressure of a rising community. 

TL;DR
game dead as my dog | Alright, I was pleasently surprised with this game so here's teh simple breakdown:

Pros:
-Fun, fast paced style of gameplay. Death results in a few short seconds and you drop back onto the field.
-Style/Attitude works well, its heavilty stylized to not look too realistic nor too cartoony. Its a little whimsical and I personally like that. It doesnt take itself too seriously and therefore is an easy pick up and learn to play sort of game.
-Decent variety of parts, game types, etc.  You can build just about anything you'd like and play in a usual range of PvP game types, Deathmatch, with or without teams, capture the point. There may be a couple others I'd forgotten about but its all very standard.
-The tank controls are difficult but not too stupidly hard. They require some getting used to, but they make kills feel earned and skilled. One of a short list of PC titles I chose to play using keyboard and mouse rather than my xbox controller.

Cons:
-Pay to win; If you dont shell out the $20 price tag you have to earn your tank parts and customizations like in a normal game. Thats fine with me, but if you DO spend the money, every part in the game is instantly unlocked. There do not appear to be any game breaking destructive weapons that allow you to dominated if you have them, however the spirit of the game ruined by the random matches full of folks who spent the cash and have the best tank they could design.
-This means you better play with friends to have fun. Now I'm not saying you cant pick this game up and play against randoms and not have a good time. However logging in with a group of pals and building machines of war and playfully blowing eachother up is way better.
-The Host system is a little bit... not good. Its the usual idea, when you are in the lobby you can click a button to invite your list of friends. The problem is that it checks them off so you cannot resend the invite if there is an issue. And there were issues. A couple instances where players did not recieve the invite and the only fix was to back out and start a new room. There also is no 'ready up' system where the host can launch the game for everyone. Everyone in the lobby has to hit their respective 'start game' button before anything happens. Not game breaking, but clunky.

Final thoughts:
Yes. Download the free version, skype with some friends, and start building your tanks. It was absolutly worth the time and effort put in and was a lot of fun. I may even pay for the basic package that grants you extra colors to paint your tank in and unlimited storage so I can collect more than 9 parts at a time. The game looks good, feels good, and has some degree of depth to it that I enjoy (Like using a spider tank to clamber clumsily up the wall to avoid my enemies). | [h1]有中文,有国服,最重要的是还不用花钱，一定值得您一试[/h1]

　ロボクラほど自由度は無いですが、誰でもちゃんと動くマシンが作れます（大事）。

　無料では装備をアンロックしていく必要があり、Basicはアンロック速度上昇＋マシンを３台までセーブ可能。プレミアムは最初から全部アンロックされている状態になります。最初は無料プレイで十分です。物足りなくなったらプレミアム化しましょう。
　ゲームモードはコンクエスト、デスマッチ、チームデスマッチの３種類あるため、それなりに気分で遊ぶことができます。装備は各種ゲームの勝敗がつくと貰えるゴールドで購入できますが、１ゲーム最長１０分程度のため初期装備で辛い時間が長くなる可能性はあります。そのため、最初の乗り出し等ではコンクエストのOasisオンリーで早回しすることでゴールドを貯める小技をすると、カスタマイズが手早くできていい感じです。

　マッチングサーバというものが無く、個人がそれぞれ部屋を作ってそこにみんなで乗り込む形なので、部屋の平均ランクを見て自分のランクと同じぐらいの部屋に行かないと無双されるだけになってしまいます。ここらへんは改善が必要だと思います。

　１ゲームが短めなので、空き時間にちょろっと遊んだりするのにうってつけなゲームです。無料だし、容量は2015/01/31現在、約1GBしかないので気軽にどうぞ。

※2015/02/01追記：Basic及びPremiumについて

両方通過したのでそれぞれの違いを。なお、BasicもPremiumも買い切りです。

無料版　：マシンは1台のみ。パーツは1マッチ終了時に貰えるゴールドでアンロック。保持できるパーツ数は初期10個で以降レベルアップごとに1個上昇。

Pros:
Well designed game
Fun to play with friends
Awesome combinations
Challenging multiplayer battles

Cons:
If you dont start out in private matches with friends, you will die nearly immediately
Disbalanced in-game matches (any level can join)
Slow gear upgrades
Only partially optimized
You have to pay to get infinite slots if you want all the gear

Ways to get rid of Cons:
Start playing with friends, then move to random multiplayer
Make private matches with friends
Buy premium or basic dlc (premium better)
Lower graphics settings, then it runs smooth
(Not really a bypass to this, but its not a pay to win)

Overall Review:
Although this game needs a bit more optimization and balancing, you can be a top player within days of playing. I think this game is more suitable for 5-10 friends (including yourself) to play together to have more fun. I do wish the game had certain restrictions on ranks for joining online matches, because my first few matches i was lucky enough to be put on a 6+ rank team against 1-5 rank team (rookie team) so I gained more money than i probably should have to start. Premium Gear Up is a good DLC game. I recommend this to anyone who wont ragequit, but rather be patient whenever they die, but they will have to learn to accept that losing is a major possibility.

8.5/10 would die again.

P.S. This is my first review, is it good?"
76561197999259031,232450,SolForge,2.25,"Casual, Free To Play, RPG, Strategy",0,"I have had an account since the early release days.  I played often for a long time.  The mechanics and cards make this game a blast to play.  But mistakes were made and the game mostly died.  The thing that made me quit was when everything was converted into costing gold.  I used to use silver to buy event tickets and sometimes splurge on a legendary chest when I was feeling impulsive.  Then the cost of boosters went from 5000 silver per pack to 7500 and everything else had to use gold(which can only be acquired by paying money for it).  That pretty much did it for me.  The greed was real.  I paid $20 for this game while it was still an early release game.  The only uses that silver has now is buying the solforge booster pack, buying deckslots, and forging cards.  I really like this game but can't recommend it.  It still has the issues of a few people paying to be at the top while the grinders are left losing early and often to these superior bought decks.  I guess that I'm in the middle of the road.  It is a good game but has many flaws. | SolForge is an interesting take on the digital card genre. It's a fairly simplistic card game, but with a suprising amount of depth / theorycrafting to your decks once you've unlocked some cards. It has the unique aspect of your cards levelling up as you play them; adding a depth of strategy that other card games haven't really explored. Not only do you have to think about what card to play right now, in order to damage your opponent, or save yourself from damage, but you also have to think about the future - and which cards you'll want then and how your deck will evolve compared to their deck.

The starter decks are playable, but I would strongly advise you to buy some packs (you can use silver which you can get from logging on daily and from winning matches) and get a custom deck going. You will get your ass kicked taking your cheap/free decks into PvP, but you can win your silver rewards playing against the AI - which is beatable on all difficulties with the starter decks, although the higher difficulties will be a challenge. If you do use real money to purchase packs, you will have a higher chance of getting the best cards, ultimately people should remember that card games are about spending money and RNG, but overall this is very playable as a free player too.

One of the big advantages of this game right now to me is that the Ipad app is extremely fluid and responsive. You can play untimed games with friends and the push notifications are accurate - meaning if you have a lazy day with 5 minutes to spare here and there, you can have a good duel with your friend from anywhere. (Untimed) games save despite the application being shut down; and you can start a game on the ipad and continue it on the PC, or have the game running in two locations at once if you so desire. A lot of digital card games right now have promised this sort of cross platform interactivity, but few have competently provided it yet. The android app is sadly not out yet so I can't comment on that - but they have said there'll be one in the future.

I'm pretty happy with it overall and would recommend. | I've played this game lots and lots. Put some money it is. Very worthwhile all that time.

Well, until the update / overhaul happened.

I played the PC version and iOS version.
And both are so down graded visually, but also the UI.
There are a few improvements that are good (timer etc). 
But overall, they just killed the game for me. | It's a good concept and would be a lot of fun, but it's pay to win. The heroic and legendary cards completely overwelm the other cards by a drastic amount. Even after months of rewards you won't be able to compete with someone who paid. In ranked play decks may be filled with over half of these types of cards. If you have a decent amount of money to throw at it then get it, but if you're just a casual gamer then it will cause you a great amount of anti-fun. | First of all, I should say I really like the way this game plays. The rules and cards are interesting and unique. 

However, I would not recommend it for most. The only players left are running around with the same 3 netdecks. Without a huge amount of money or time, you have no chance. With a huge amount of money or time, you're stuck using one of those 3 netdecks to compete. 

There is a ranking system, however the player base is so small that it doesn't really seem to find matches based on anything.

I really enjoyed this game when it first came out, but then I couldn't keep up and got tired of getting stomped by the same decks with 70% legendary cards.

Bottom Line: This game isn't friendly to new players, and is slowly losing old players. It's a shame."

I absolutely love this game. I also very much hate it at the same time; but not for the reasons you would think. (This will come to light later on in my review)

FoF has become one of my favorite games, and for the record I should have close to 600+ hours on this game. (If this doesn't prove my love for this game, I don't know what will; and no. Sacrifices are not part of this equation)

In reality, I can give you a three paged essay on why you should play this game, or at least give it a shot; but in the end, the only real way to find out if you fit this game, is to try it. (The game doesn't fit you, you must fit the game.)

作为一名机甲游戏的爱好者，我当然也是对HAWKEN充满了期待。
就画面来说，对于处于beta之中的游戏，能够达到HAWKEN这样的水准应该是相当不错的了。无论是光影的渲染，还是细腻的建模和精美的贴图，都能很好的展现游戏的魅力。
不过也许是beta的缘故，游戏的音乐音效显得较为单调，特别是在战斗中。千篇一律的开火声音，乏味的背景音乐，很难调动起玩家的情绪。音效抓不住玩家的神经，经常打着打着就走了神。这一点希望能在以后的版本中得到提高。
另外谈一下游戏性，个人认为HAWKEN的操作在同类游戏中应该是比较顺手的。快速转身系统的设定也很新颖，能够让游戏多出更多的可操作性。各个机甲的设定也都各有特色，道具、武器和机甲本身的配合也较考验玩家的技术。不过可惜的是，游戏中似乎并没有配置近战武器，这多多少少有点令人失望，希望能在以后的版本中加入更多的武器系统。

This game has beautiful visuals.

This game has wide customisation.

This game has well fleshed out mechs and interesting abilities.

This game has a range of fun and varied game modes.

This game has...

Nothing. Not anymore.

Hawken was a great game with a small but dedicated fan base. Player counts were starting to pick up, youtubers were starting to review the game, and a strong community loyalty bonded players both to the game and to fellow gamers. Unfortunately while this was happening the publishers of the original devs squandered what money was raised on unnecessary, unasked for merchandise. The devs ran out of money, and Hawken development was discontinued.

The game was still fun, but with a floundering playerbase it was difficult to keep it alive. Regardless, with an injection of new players the game could be great once again.

Then Hawken was bought. Our beautiful game, purchased by a dev team renowned for grinding up and milking games for money. This is where I hung up my coat, and called quits. Since then, I've been monitoring Hawken in the hope it will once again ascend to it's former glory.

And what a naieve hope that was. The game was ported to console edition, but it flopped. The steam community was abandoned, and players have lost money and time they invested to errors- errors ignored and unanswered by the devs. Our game has been abandoned by people who cannot even muster the pretense to care.

Hawken, I miss you.

Hawken, I love you.





Hawken, I loved you. | The game is dead.  This is what happens to great games with good concepts, that are put in the hands of incompetent, greedy developers.
How do you screw up a game with this much potential? Awesome graphics and gameplay, great mechs.  I played this game for years and even then the developers were hardly updating.  Shame they cant just give it to another company and let them put in some hardwork and cash in on this game. | RIP 

You were once a great mech game with the amazing potential to be the best. I'm sorry you were built only to be used like a cheap microtransaction freemium whore and tossed aside like garbage. I do not reget spending money on you, although I both lament and rue those decisions. 

Goodnight my sweet. | Awesome Game, only 6 hours in after 2 HOURS both myself, and my best friend decided that a full 30$ investment in the nemesis bundle was a must. but here are some points i would like to make about the game:

- Great Dev Support and community interaction

-Great Gameplay

-Doesnt feel pay2win(p2w), as i often have been outmatched by the default mech even with my fully customized assault mech (courtesy of the nemesis bundle!)  

-The game provides VARIETY in maps(although i wish there were alot more for TDM!) and the pacing and gameplay is always fluid and the registration and everything is very on point (in my opinion)

-Doesnt Get Stale(So far) the game has not got boring at all, out of town trips and work recently have made me not be able to invest all of the time i wish i could be into this great, free to play, title made by AWESOME devs who seriously have impressed me GREATLY.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I see many people, certainly in the discussion forum for hawken on steam seem to think this game is pay to win, or is unfair to new players. well as i mentioned in some of the many strongpoints i noted this game definately does not feel pay to win at ALL you can pay to customize your mech, as well as your play style. i feel as if a VAST majority of the playerbase can florish in this game even with the most basic mech(the default mech, in this case) and honestly. even if you were to want to grind it honestly isnt that bad. i was too busy communicating with my teamate and enjoying great gameplay to notice. my Review For HAWKEN on steam (Rated By Category)

Gameplay 9/10 ( could use minor improvements,that i am sure will be addressed so i will not go into as they are meager in terms of interruption of my experience/enjoyment with the game)

Visuals 9/10 (Looks great on Low!) But the game is, as stated in the requirements not for the most average gamings pc's, i maintain a steady framerate at medium, high is just a little too much for my Gaming laptop, runs on max on my rig no problem.

f2p Fairness 10/10(while you certainly can buy items with credits purchase by real currency, the game never feels like it is pay to win, and the gameplay is always fair. pay if you feel like investing into your favorite mech(s) or grind the game and earn it!  all  you can pay for is customization and convenience (battlefield for example, in  bad company 2 allowed you to purchase shortcut packs to different classes, and that is a full retail release (AAA) at that so is it so wrong to pay 5,10, or over 9000! on a game that is certainly worth it and completely outdoes its f2p tag.

Controls/Navigation-10/10 i found the controls extremely easy to get used to and all of the default mapping was great for all options, and everything is relatively easy to manage and navigate

Community 9/10- in my first hours of hawken me and my best friend were eager to learn and the community was certainly helpful on not ony the forums but also in game chat. some minor annoyances occured in game with people complaining of 
""Hackers"" or ""p2w losers"" but overall i have had a great experience.
OVERALL SCORE 9/10 Must Try!

Thank you for reading, i would also like ot note that i installed hawken purely for a quick fix for titanfall, but soon realised that this game might be the king of mech games afterall, it takes mech combat and gameplay and makes it amazing, without the need for any desire to ever leave your mech(why would you, anyways?!)  this was my first full review and i thank anyone who took the time to read it!, i will hopefully build on it in the future with more examples, notes. but for now, back to the game!

Hawken is the S#!t. Go Install It!"

— Вот именно... — подтвердил проходящий мимо куст. (с) Терри Пратчетт

Юмор, драйв, тонна фана! Если Вам пришлась по душе первая часть, то обязательно попробуйте новую Wizard Wars. Если же Вам первая часть не понравилась, то скорее всего Вы в неё и не играли вовсе. Притензии у консерваторов, конечно же, найдутся, как-то: возможность соединения только 3х элементов в спелл, вместо 5ти, а также новая система магик, расположенных теперь на скилл-панельке и требующих заряда. Но здесь то ,как раз таки, всё понятно и простительно. Игра теперь ориентирована сугубо на онлайн-ПВП, требуется соблюдать баланс, что подразумевает ограничение игроков в использовании самых ваншотных убер-магик. Ограничение только в 4ре возможные магики для выбора, сугубо для меня, штука более чем положительная, добавляющая разнообразие в виде различных билдов.
Конечно же, реализовано в игре ещё крайне мало. Но она уже доставляет чуть более, чем полностью. Ждём новых режимов и доработки существующих, но Wizard Wars и на данный момент вполне играбельна и... я уже написал, что игра доставляет, да? Ну и ладно: она доставляет!
Скажу честно, я не особенный поклонник МОБА-игр. Возможно, что именно потому Wizard Wars мне так понравилась. (Да, да, на момент написания обзора мой стаж в игре вполне смешон, но, как я уже писал выше, на данный момент реализовано в игре крайне мало, так что с нынешним контентом я уже успел ознакомиться)

П.С.: перевод для школьников:
ВАЩЕ КАРОЧИ ПОСОНЫ... ТАКАЯ ХРЕНЬ! ЗАХОЖУ Я ПАГАМАТЬ АТАМ ВАЩЯ ТАКАЯ МАЧИЛАВА ШО Я ЛУИЧАМИ СМЕРТИ ПРЯМА А ОН ТАКАЙ ХРЯСЬТЬ!!!

Players familiar with the original Magicka's combat system will definitely have an easier time getting into Wizard Wars despite how the combat now has been greatly balanced around in order to better suit a fast paced competetive PvP enviroment. The rest who haven't played or heard the original Magicka might have some problems getting used to how the combat works due to the lack of an effective practice system, but you can assume there will most likely be one available in the future.

Currently there is only one map, less than a handful of various items, the level and in-game currency system has no real meaning, matchmaking system and games that can last between 30 seconds to 10 minutes.

Get the early access if you enjoyed the original Magicka, or like a unique fast paced competetive enviroment. If you're not certain, you can always wait for the game to go free to play. | This game is the perfect test of skill when it comes to videogames. It comes down to two things: muscle-memory and anticipation. In Magicka: Wizard Wars you use the keys QWER and ASDF to chain elements together. Once elements have been ""Queued"" up, you can decide whether to cast it on yourself, or in front of you. 

There are many different ""types"" of spells such as mines, walls, beams, cones, and wards, and depending on which elements you choose and how you cast them, you could make a steam explosion around you, or a flame cone in front of you, or a geyser rock wall to seperate you from your enemies.

The basic Wizard Wars game is played in a map with two teams of four. The objective is to deny your enemies the ability to spawn by either depleting their spawn tokens, or capturing all the spawn points on the map, preventing the enemies from respawning. Matches can take anywhere from 2 minutes to an hour or more, depending on the skill of the wizards. Sometimes the fights just don't seem to end, because two players can predict each others moves so accurately.

There are endless numbers of magicka-style robes, staves, weapons, and ""trinkets"" to unlock for your wizard, their appearances ranging from ""badass"" to ""pink"" and ""why?"" There are even chances to get exceptionally rare items, like my golden merfolk robe that has a blue magikarp for the hood. Yes, as in the pokemon.

Every item gives you the opportunity to change your playstyle: Robes, Staves, and Trinkets alter your affinities for each spell, lending more power to different elements. Weapons offer different melee attacks, and sometimes have elemental properties, like adding flame or frost to your strikes.

Overall, MWW is one of the best, most well-polished games I've ever played on steam, regardless of the early access tag. Nothing is overpowered, nothing is underpowered, Every match is a unique experience, filled with unique wizards. The only thing this game needs is more players. So please, give Wizard Wars a try. If you find yourself being pummeled each and every match, ask someone for help, or practice memorizing your favorite spells in the training grounds. You'll get it in no time. | Прежде чем оставить свой отзыв, хочу спросить один вопрос: Почему игры серии Magicka так мало известны???

Касаемо Magicka Wizard Wars, то из бета теста она вышла не так давно и пока доступно 3 режима игры:
1. Охота на душ. Чем-то напоминает Dota, но башен только 2(вражеская и твоя), нужно убивать местных крипов, чтобы ослабить защиту противника(4v4). 
2. Война. Месиво с захватом точек. Есть несколько карт.(4v4)
3. Дуэль. Режим позволяющить выяснить кто круче. Также имеется несколько карт(1v1)
Присутствует лобби для создания своей игры(если хочешь поиграть со своими друзьями или против них)
Множество вещей для кастомизации своего персонажа.... и прочее..
[u]Я как фанат этой игры жду от нее новых карт и режимов(I was a fan of this game waiting for new maps and modes). Было бы не плохо добавить мастерскую для создания предметов(It would be good to add a workshop to create items)[/u]

The battlesystem is pretty unique and a little moba-like, but atleast I personally like the fact that every player starts with equal stats (if not counting the slight bonuses from robes, weapons etc) so winning a game isn't about your team setup after all.
Games usually last from 2 to 10 minutes wich is very nice and losing because of someone going afk doesn't really feel bad at all because the time wasted is only a couple of minutes. 

I would recommend this game for anyone intrested in PvP-based games and specially if you are into arena kind of action. 

You just have to remember this game is still in alpha (in December 2013) and it has bugs, some technical problems from time to time. There is just a minimal tutorial atm so getting into the spell-combat system takes a day or two. 

Don't buy the early access unless you understand the fact that this game is still work in progress."

並不是開無雙屠殭屍的遊戲，殭屍能不打的就盡量避免打，一個不小心被咬到出血或者感染，繃帶和藥物是沒那麼容易找到的，而且除了超稀有的抗體針，藥是不能完全根治感染，只是拖延發作而已，找不到藥與針的話就唯有吞槍自殺，以免突變成殭屍連累隊友。
槍械效果與細節做得很好，看不到自己有多少彈藥，需要長按R檢查自己所剩的彈藥量，然後彈藥無比珍貴，沒有到處滿地都是的彈藥，每一發子彈都非常珍貴。
揮動武器,奔跑,跳躍都會消耗體力，體力消耗完就不能揮動武器了，只能等體力恢復，並不是怎樣打怎樣跳都不會累和喘氣的怪人。

1、共同回合的机制。对战双方同时执行自己的回合，然后统一结算。富有战略性，能体验运筹帷幄的快乐。
2、对战区域的划分。包括进攻区域、防守区域、支援区域、指挥官区域，以及由它们组成的概念：被部署区域、战场。区域的划分和不同区域特定的功能大大扩展了对战策略的可能性。
3、卡组机制。组成套牌前对势力的选择决定了你整个套牌的风格和可利用的资源，要求玩家不断取舍，最终完成自己喜欢的战术。
4、比较轻松的游戏体验。不需要大量的时间、精力和金钱投入。
当你在了解了整个游戏从确立思路、组建套牌到最终随机应变取得胜利之后，游戏的体验会相当不错。然而这款游戏的诸多缺点也就来源于玩家这个熟悉过程之前。
1、中文翻译不完整，概念解释缺失。游戏初期有诸多不加解释的概念，严重影响玩家融入游戏。包括组建套牌时的规则不明确，会让新手玩家摸不着头脑。
2、糟糕的网络连接。较差的网络环境甚至不能让你完整体验一场游戏。
3、UI（交互界面元素）设计不合理，拥有较多生物时会拥挤，难以精确操作。画面特效单一。
当玩家熟悉了这些之后，我仍然认为这款游戏值得喜爱卡牌游戏的玩家尝试一下。同时也希望官方能加紧改正上述缺点（如果可能的话）
希望我的体验能帮到大家，祝大家游戏愉快。
 | É um jogo de cartas animado em que você coloca diversas criaturas para duelar em seu nome. São vários adversários em uma campanha longa, que passa por diversos lugares e enfrenta desafiantes poderosos e repletos de recursos para frear a sua jornada.
Jogo bom, porém algumas funções meia confusas. | 粗略玩了一下.简单地来说一说自己的观点.
优点:
1.相较于其他卡牌游戏,双方同时执行回合的玩法增加了游戏的战略性
2.每个种族的特性较为鲜明
3.场地被划分为3块(支援区,进攻区,防守区)的玩法也增加了游戏的战略性

缺点:
1.每个玩家虽然拥有两种血量,但其实第二种血量(士气)基本只是为了龙族之裔的削士气战术单独服务.95%的时候士气都是多余的.作为游戏中的重要参数之一,略显累赘
2.卡牌技能介绍做地非常差,是我玩过的所有卡牌游戏中最差的一款,这足以成为让新人弃坑的原因.举例:人族某卡被部属在进攻区域后会拥有坚不可摧特性,至于坚不可摧是什么,我翻遍了游戏都没找到解释.也许是不受战斗伤害,也许是不会受到伤害,也许就是无敌.同上还有超载X,激怒X,虚弱X,生命X等
3.游戏的卡包过多,而且无法得知卡包内所包含的所有卡.只能通过牌组中浏览所有卡来逆向搜索自己想要的卡所在的卡包.
4.卡片虽然可以交易,但是与此同时也少了拆分合成功能.低稀有度卡极易数量溢出.且对于独狼玩家来说伤害巨大.
5.牌组组合界面操作相当难受,你能同时浏览到的牌只有一行约10张.而滚动牌堆时的操作惯性相当违和,稍微滚动一点只能翻过几张,而再稍微多滚动一点则是会一口气翻过去很多张.与此同时,当你想把牌加入指挥官位置时,如果放置位置不当,就会把所有同名卡全部移除牌组,然后你又不得不自己一张一张加回来.
6.游戏技巧需要玩家自己挖掘,战斗前的读取界面没有实用的小提示.举例:一般卡片的牌组数量限制为3,被加入到指挥官位置的卡不会被算入卡组数量限制.即,一张数量限制为3的卡最多可以在牌组中添加6张(指挥官位置X3+牌组X3).
7.游戏系统极其难受,当你在场上拥有大量单位以后,他们将在区域里挤成一团.而如果你想拉动他们到其他区域,你需要极其小心且不得不一张一张地拉动它们,假如你还想将他们的位置顺序交换,你还得再小心翼翼地拉动它们.整个过程对操作的精度要求比较高,至少不像是从手牌拍怪那样按住鼠标往上甩就好了.

虽然我列举的缺点比优点多很多,而且也不推荐这款游戏.但是我还是比较喜欢这款游戏的.优点虽然少,但是核心玩法还是可圈可点的.而且缺点大部分也不会经常经历.

至于不推荐的理由:
1.这款游戏不适合入门级卡牌游戏玩家以及欠缺耐心和金钱的玩家.游戏已经开服很久了,对于现在入坑的玩家来说,要补的卡包数量相当可观.而且由于没有卡片拆分合成系统.要不氪金完全组出自己的牌组需要以月为单位来积累.当然你能找到大佬免费送你卡当我没说.
2.2014年9月5日发行的游戏,我今天2017年2月12日刚玩了8.1个小时(通完剧情,教程,挑战,打了盘竞技场,开玩送的卡包,又自己买了一包开,自己组了一套牌组)就能发现游戏还有那么多不方便的地方,其中几个地方还令人发指(战斗时卡片聚堆)这让我对游戏开发商的态度以及能力表示怀疑. | wonderful game, can't understand all the hate is receiving. It's fun and entertaining, a perfect way to spend an hour or two in front of the pc. 

To the devs: please fix the japanese faction (you know, the green one based on morale ) because they're absolute trash right now, lol. | I have not played the remake of this game recently, but one big reason, and I hope the creators stop going down this path:

They've split their already small cult following into 3 by publishing 3 similar games with the same IP and similar gameplay. Not sure what the goal of that was, when their player base is already fairly small, because it's going to make me and others reluctant to invest in Infinity Wars Classic if it's going to be replaced by Infinity Wars 2 in the future. They really need to combine the games back into one, focus on it, and make it hit critical mass so that players can actually start recommending it to their friends.

EDIT: Thanks for the explanation! This makes more sense than what I had originally understood, so I've updated the review accordingly.

I will say that while I still have some doubts, the game design of Infinity Wars is honestly a masterpiece, it solves all the problems I've had with other online card games (like Hearthstone/MTGO) in the past. I'll highlight the two biggest points which I think other online card games got wrong.

Firstly, there's actual trading, and it doesn't feel like MTGO where it feels like you're trading with a stock market because there's thousands of copies of each card. It feels much more like going to a card game store and trading with friends, because there's multiple different rarities which make the more rare card+rarity combinations rare enough that they feel unique. This means that people will haggle, or look around to find someone who has that one card they've been looking for. Feels very much like trading in-person.

Secondly, it removes the RNG aspect of mana-based card games in the early game. Games with lands like MTG and Eternal suffer from mana flood/drought, which adds an unnecessary and un-fun element of RNG to the game. However, even Hearthstone which does not have lands, suffers from early game RNG because drawing cards on curve is extremely important to surviving/winning the early game, and makes early game much more RNG dependent than lategame. This game fixes both problems by having automatic mana increases like Hearthstone, but also giving you a choice of 3 Commanders which you can choose during deck-building to start every game with. This lets you pick defensive early game, and scaling options as a control deck, so you don't end up skipping your first 4 turns like other card games, and high tempo high power cards for aggro decks, so you don't feel like you just fall behind early game and have no hope because of a bad draw.

This review may have become very long, but it's because I honestly believe Infinity Wars is the best designed card game out there, and as long as they can get the UI/marketing done right, it will be a huge hit in my opinion."

It's unplayable and the support I've reached out to either ignores me or says it's steam's issue for the game not working and steam won't take any form of help when requests are made to them. This is a great example why you shouldn't throw in extra connections or third party connections etc. One thing is removed and it's all broke.What's worse?

Сразу видно, что подход у разработчиков к проекту особенный, так как многое, что представлено в проекте есть и в прочих играх подобного направления, но здесь это сделано несколько под иным углом. Система крафта, строительства - сделаны довольно необычно и даже интересно, но проблема в том, что проект все еще прибывает на стадии Alpha-версии и довести весь этот функционал разработчики все еще не успели.

Визуальный стиль не раздражает, а даже притягивает своими нежными тонами. Все выглядит довольно привлекательно и с душой.
Музыка для проекта вполне добротная и очень мягкая.
Все вышепредставленные достоинства и наполняют проект неповторимой красотой и антуражем, не свойственным другим проектам.

Все кто приобрели игру уже очень давно и раздосадованы тем, что разработчики уже давно не пополняют свой проект новым контентом и не обновляют старый, не печальтесь, они уверяют и подтверждают на своем [i]Twitch-канале[/i], что скоро грядет глобальное обновление, которое изменит абсолютно все, что уже имеется в игре.

Разработчики уже добавили поддержку всеми любимого режима кооперативной игры, систему классов, полностью изменил механику игры и многое-многое другое.

[b]UPD: 11.12.2015[/b]: 
Посетил форумы в центре сообщества игры ""[b]Under The Ocean[/b]"" и хочу сказать, что тех игроков, которые так ждали нового, умопомрачительного билда игры ждет лишь разочарование.
Дело в том, что над игрой работало 2 человека, но совсем недавно один из них покинул команду из-за разногласий. Этим человеком был некий [i]Майк[/i], он являлся главным программистом игры ""[b]Under The Ocean[/b]"". Теперь над игрой трудится лишь [b]один человек[/b], с более низкими знаниями в сфере программирования. Для него это событие было просто шоком, т.к насколько я понял, [i]Майк[/i] забрал все свои наработки себе и [i]единственному разработчику[/i] придется делать все с нуля.
Также он заявил, что многие начали просить возврат денег и он их выплачивал до того момента, пока были деньги на банковском счету, но теперь денег нет, а нужно кормить сына.
[i]Разработчик[/i] всеже уверяет, что он будет работать над проектом каждый неполный рабочий день и доведет дело до конца в любом случае, даже если на это уйдет очень и очень много времени.
[i]Этот парень[/i] также сообщил о своем проблемном состоянии в службу поддержки [b]Steam[/b] для того, чтобы страница игры ""[b]Under The Ocean[/b]"" была убрана из магазина и покупатели не вводились в заблуждение.
Да уж, очень не приятная новость. Даже как-то не жалко потраченых денег([i]Takedown RedSaber выглядит хуже, чем настоящий билд этой игры[/i]), жалко человека, который все еще продалжает бороться."

76561197999259031,202270,Unknown,0.0,,0,"I want to recommend this game. I really, really do. It's a refreshing style of turn-based strategy that makes you rely quite heavily on your wits and intuition. It's the sort of game where the winner is not decided by the size of their ship and its guns, but by the savvy of the player. It has a timeless style and an endearing sense of humor that tends to leave one in a good mood, even as their ships sink to the briny deep.

I want to recommend this game, but I can't. The single player campaign could be beaten in a matter of hours, even at a leasurely pace, and leaves much to be desired. It was obviously designed to recieve regular attention from the developers, who seem to have forgotten it. However, the thing that really sinks this game (pun intended) is the lack of a multiplayer community. This game was made with the intention that players would faithfully and regularly play with and against each other, and although it started out that way, it never coelesced. Unless you have friends that you know also want to play this game, it's simply not worth it. | A really great trailer, that is probably what makes the game great, but after that trailer is gone the rest is just... Offline non workingess that is left.
The game does its own ""check"" if you have internet connection, if it fails that it doesn't let you go online, but it is flawed.
It doesn't even let you TRY to log in to their servers, nor give any useful information to you to help you troubleshoot the problem.

All it takes to break this system? Exit the game after first launch, then restart it.
So the multiplayer part is out of the window, the UI is very clunky and the functions aren't intuitive to use, basically a lot of saving is done, and those saves you can't use if you are in ""Offline mode"", so if you built a nice fleet it is all goners.

Overall, this game is now EOL (End Of Life) but the best part about it you can enjoy for free, and that is the launch trailer.
You want naval warfare you have to look at Dangerous Waters or SCS Fleet Command for something that somewhat works, but it is a dead market today with very few good ones popping up to replace the oldies. | This game was epic when it came out, the problem is the fact there is no skirmish mode on solo play, you need to play with someone and at the moment no one plays it anymore.

Сама кампания также имеет нестандартную структуру. У игрока нет какого-то отряда, с которым эта кампания проходится, который можно прокачать, или который имеет смысл беречь. Наоборот - для каждой миссии за просто так можно сделать произвольный отряд. Вобщем объединение 9 миссий в одну кампанию - чистая условность.

It has no tutorial, doesn't tell you what to expect or what to do, the only thing you know is there are 11 tapes on the map. 

The map itself is procedural generated with very and I mean VERY limited variate, you will struggle to know if you have been to a place as there is no way of indicating yourself if you have. There is no mini map or anything of that sort either. 

Graphically it is trash, the shadows are terrible even on the highest settings, guns look ok, but nothing impressive even for its time. 

The guns are fine, but the controls for them are awful, even after rebinding it doesn't feel good. It is so bad that it took me 30 minutes to just to understand how to reload bullets into the Glock mag, you need to first remove the magazine, then holster the weapon and only then you can even see what button lets you reload, it won't tell you this process anywhere. 
Aiming is ok, it felt a bit too high on sensitivity at first but you get used to it.

Now the worst part, the enemies. There are 2 types of enemies in this game, one is spinning turrets and the other is flying drones. The drones will charge at you once they see you and make an audible noise when they do so, if one of them touches you, you are dead. Turrets also make a noise when they see you, a single bullet hit and you are, again, dead. All your progress resets and so does the map seed. This is the most frustrating part of this ""game"" because the enemies also spawn randomly, which means there will be times where the turrets can see you but you have no idea where it is because the gap it sees you from is tiny. If there was any way of saving like maybe after every 3 tapes or something it would be bearable, but at its current state it is not. 

Don't even get this on sale, it is nothing more then a demo that should have been free at least after a while of its release. | The controls are all over the place, the gameplay loop revolves around your ability to remember which buttons does what (I panicked and threw my entire mag so many times :(  ).

Und das ändert sich auch während des Spielens nicht.
Ausser, dass man sich hin und wieder dabei ertaptt, sich zu wünschen, dass noch mehr Animationen und Wuselfaktoren ihren Weg ins Spiel finden würden.

Hier noch ein Hühnchen mehr, dort ein Fischerbötchen, vielleicht noch ein paar Wettereffekte, Tag & Nachtwechsel, Godrays, Lensflares, ...

Aber für so ein niederländisches Indie-Studio mit nur wenig Manpower (gerade mal 4 Leute) ist das schon sehr stark.
Man sieht eigentlich schon schön auf einen Blick woran es bei der jeweiligen Siedlung/ Stadt so hapert ... oder wo es gut läuft.

Wie bei ""DIE SIEDLER"" oder ""ANNO"" - nur das hier eben riesige Teams dahinter stecken, die ganz andere Effekte reinballern konnten.

Die dreh- und zoombaren Planeten in echter 3D wie bei Populous 3 wäre natürlich auch schick.
Aber auch die 2D Ansicht ist ... naja, wie erwähnt: charmant.

Irgendwie liebenswert und kindgerecht 🤗

Hast Du mal ""DORFROMANTIK gespielt?""

Ein schön unaufdringlicher Soundteppich aus eingängiger Musik und Naturgerüschen.

Hätte man sich vielleicht sogar früher auf CD geholt zur Entspannungsförderung.

Hier erinnert es dann doch an Populous 1 und 2 oder auch Siedler 1 und 2.
Da ist die Geräuschkulisse ähnlich unaufgeregt und lenkt nicht vom Geschehen ab.

Mit grausen denke ich noch an das permanent-penetrante ""WIR MÜSSEN HÜTTEN BAUEN"" aus Black & White 1, was mich irgendwann dermaßen aggressiv machte, dass ich meiner Kreatur befahl alle Dorfbewohner zu fressen und zu zerstampfen.

Hüttenproblem erledigt.

Das wird hier nicht passieren 😁

Um was geht es denn nun?

Ist das so eine Art:
- Populous?
- Black & White?
- Dungeon Keeper?
- Dust?

Nope.
Alle diese oberen Spiele sind wahre Götter unter den - nun- Göttersimulationen.

Auch wenn man hier Titanen steuert, die eigene Fähigkeiten haben:
- Löcher graben und Wasser fluten
- Berge anheben und Wüsten schaffen
- Wälder und Sümpfe aus dem Boden zaubern
- Tiere, Pflanzen, Fische, Mineralien, etc. erschaffen
- bestehende Landstücke und Fauna/Flora verbessern, aufleveln...
wird nie eine Göttersimulation alá Populous daraus,

Es gibt quasi keine gegnerischen Entitäten.

Du bist ein Planet und versuchst das Beste aus Dir zu machen.
Das Beste besteht in diesem Fall darin weit fortschrittliche Dörfer und Städte gedeihen zu lassen, die sich nicht gegenseitig an die Gurgel gehen!

Dazu ist Deine gesamte Oberfläche in Parzellen eingeteilt.

Und je nachdem welche Parzelle neben welcher anderen:
- platziert und
- gehegt und
- gebufft und
- generfed und
- entwickelt
wird entstehen andere Synergie- und Kupplungseffekte.

Symbiosen genannt.

Im Grunde wie ein gutes Kartendeck-Legespiel.

Manchmal musste ich schmunzelnd an YU GI OH denken.
Erst spiele ich diese Karte und wenn ich diese andere daneben packe, werte ich die erste auf und wenn ich dann noch diese eine dritte dazu werfe, ändert sich der Effekt auf die beiden anderen und sie werden noch mächtiger.

Wenn die Dörfer und Städte wachsen dann stellen sie Botschafter ab, die Du auf Deine Titanen packst und die dann noch weitere Fähigkeiten freischalten.
Dann kannst Du beispielsweise aus ""normalen"" Tieren ""exotische Tiere"" machen, die dann nicht nur Nahrung, sondern auch Reichtum bringen, usw.

Also bitte KEIN Populous erwarten!

Gunpoint es un juego de puzzles y plataformas, pero con un enfoque más pausado, donde prima la estrategia y el sigilo. Somos Richard Conway, un espía freelance (autónomo) que por casualidad es grabado por las cámaras de seguridad en la escena de un crimen, el asesinato de Selena Delgado. La jefa de esta mujer, Melanie Rooke, se pone en contacto con nosotros para pedirnos que recuperemos la grabación donde aparece el asesino real de su empleada y amiga Selena, chantajeándonos con que de lo contrario, la policía pensará que nosotros somos el asesino. De este modo deberemos infiltrarnos en distintas instalaciones bien vigiladas para hackear diversos dispositivos y obtener información sensible. Sin embargo, poco a poco iremos adentrándonos en una red de conspiraciones mucho más profunda de lo que cabría esperar, donde se ven implicadas las grandes empresas armamentísticas del país y la policía. Por ello, diferentes personajes contactarán con nosotros para reclamar nuestros servicios o pedirnos ayuda con diversos problemas personales, siendo nuestro principal objetivo desenmascarar al verdadero asesino de Selena.

[h2]Jugabilidad / Apartado técnico[/h2]
Gunpoint nos ofrece diferentes misiones de dificultad y complejidad creciente, donde el principal objetivo suele ser colarse en instalaciones fuertemente vigiladas para hackear algún ordenador, robar objetos clave o escuchar conversaciones privadas. Para ello, nuestro espía podrá hacer uso de una gran variedad de gadgets y dispositivos de alta tecnología que harán su labor de infiltración mucho más sencilla. Por un lado, contamos con los pantalones Bullfrog, los cuales nos permiten saltar grandes distancias, noquear a nuestros enemigos o caer desde alturas sorprendentemente altas. Por otro, iremos adquiriendo nuevos aparatos que harán nuestra vida más sencilla, siendo el Crosslink el más importante. Este dispositivo introduce las mecánicas de puzzle al juego, permitiéndonos ver la instalación eléctrica del edificio y “recablear” diferentes aparatos a voluntad, como interruptores, puertas, cámaras de seguridad, lámparas, etc. En cada misión deberemos hacer uso de estas mecánicas para completar las distintas misiones que nos ofrezcan, tratando de cumplir con ciertos parámetros de sigilo, violencia, tiempo, etc., y siendo recompensados económicamente por nuestros servicios para así, hacernos con nueva tecnología.

[h2]Valoración[/h2]
Gunpoint es un juego de puzzles realmente bueno, que sabe introducir las mecánicas de acción y sigilo de una forma muy interesante. Su jugabilidad es muy dinámica, ya que primero nos obliga a observar y pensar tranquilamente cómo vamos a llevar a cabo la misión, decidiendo que aparatos recablear, qué puertas debemos tomar, la ruta de vigilancia que siguen nuestros enemigos, etc., para luego llevar nuestro plan a la acción de forma rápida y limpia, sin ser vistos ni morir en el intento. La forma de abordar cada misión puede ser diferente y creativa, dejando cierto poder de decisión al jugador para tomar distintas rutas o usar diferentes aparatos. Además, también podremos elegir entre varias opciones de diálogo con nuestros clientes, pudiendo modificar el resultado final de la historia. En resumen, un gran juego de puzzles que recomiendo probar y que ofrece entre 6-7 horas de entretenimiento.
Lo salvaría de un incendio! 👨‍🚒👍🔥

No game，no life.这绝非虚言。
小初时期在家传的旧电脑上，游玩一些可以带的动相当古早的一些游戏。在二十一世纪的第二个十年，在一系列堪称巅峰级别的大作接连发售时，我却似乎和我的电脑一起被困在了时代里。
妇孺皆知的红色警戒，彼时烂尾的大作命令与征服三发售时，我还在为兵临城下模组着迷；R星的侠盗猎车手V发售的五年后，我还在和汤米维塞迪，卡尔约翰逊一起在前3d世界观中遨游；当CS：GO已经成为现象级游戏，而此时CS1.6的人机还会卡在大仓的隧道里一动不动；至于2016年发行的文明VI六，飞天之梦响彻云霄时，我在北方的那座小城里，听着BabaYet的沙锤声，游玩着2007年发行的文明IV第四代（很巧也是四）以及跃跃欲试但在2016年仍带不动的2013发行的文明V第五代。如果说前款游戏是中国游戏界现象级的存在，而我在这个时代的最末期仍游玩的津津有味。对于文明系列，可以这样说，游戏甚至某种程度上改变了我的人生轨迹。如果我当时没有把心思放在自给自足得到的这些关注人文，关注历史的游戏上，而是去参透什么别的兴趣。也许有可能我就不会学文科，也不会选择现在的专业。
感谢某些无脑盗用游戏画面的游戏小作坊，把自己的游戏用其他游戏界面进行包装，搭便车宣传自己粗制滥造的游戏，但无巧不成书，也让我阴差阳错的知道了Paradox Interactive——一个曾经冷门，现在热度与日俱增甚至一度市值超过育碧的世界级游戏公司——以及属于他的作品们。很可惜和上述所有的游戏一致，我似乎也只“配”玩到极落后版本的游戏——这甚至也是一种奢求。不出意料的，当我尝试运作1.1版本的欧陆风云四时，电脑烧了。
这时是2020年初，拜疫情网课所赐，我终于有了一台自己的笔记本电脑，在通过各种渠道帮助下，从一位网友手中拿到了一份学习版的1.30版本的欧陆风云四。那个夏天，在烈日和暴雨下，以大明为开局，我的游戏生活第二春开始了。
但直到2023年高考结束后，我才在steam上买到正版的EU4，反倒是HOI4 21年就有了正版，那时候小黑盒还是卖兑换码的，现在早就没有了。
直到今天，2025年1月25日，本游戏严格的在线时长突破了一千小时，完成成就190个。这其中有太多的故事可以讲了，用法兰西拿破仑传播共和革命理念，用金雀花王朝重新统合大陆领地成立安茹帝国，从长白山脚下一隅到全中华的大清，从高加索群山中杀出的萨法维波斯，荣耀的哈布斯堡让Aeiou的格言传遍欧洲，摆脱鞑靼枷锁，“为了俄罗斯母亲”的莫斯科大公国，把握土木之变，重返中国的瓦剌，乃至重建蒙古帝国。令人感触最深的定是用拜占庭一隅小国绝境翻盘，重获新生，再造罗马，紫凤翱翔！感谢她给了我一个在现实中编织一个梦的机会，也让我在这个梦中徜徉，流连，不愿醒来也不愿离去。
游戏的意义和人生每件事的意义大抵都相类似，再你经历其中时，拼尽全力的达成那个目标，结束之后回头看，除了享受结果，更感慨唏嘘其过程，这便是寄意寒星荃不察，不负光阴不负心。
希望以后更好，直到时间和世界的尽头。

76561197999259031,233250,Unknown,1.1666666666666667,,0,"Planetary Annihilation (PA) - весьма необычная, а скорее, даже уникальная в своём роде стратегия в реальном времени, полями боя в которой являются не привычные современным игрокам плоские карты, а целые луны, планеты, и даже планетарные системы. Собственно говоря, первая ""фишка"" игры заключается в сферичности карт, то есть, в отличие от классических RTS, игрок может подвергнуться нападению откуда угодно, что на корню изменяет стратегию игры. Защищаться приходится сразу со всех сторон, невозможно просто отгородиться от неприятеля стеной турелей, так как любую стену можно просто-напросто обойти. Вполне очевидно, что такое построение игрового пространства открывает игрокам огромный простор для тактических манёвров.

Вторая особенность PA - колоссальные масштабы боёв. Как говорят сами разработчики, они хотели отодвинуть микроменеджмент на второй план, так что вместо отдельных юнитов игрок управляет целыми армиями, редко состоящими менее, чем из пары сотен юнитов. Когда в таких знаковых играх как Warcraft/Starcraft игроку приходится заботиться о добром здравии каждого солдата, здесь это не нужно, да и, в общем-то, совершенно невозможно. Это отнюдь не значит, что вся стратегия сводится к построению большого количества войск, обведению их рамочкой и нажатию ПКМ на вражескую базу; такой подход, скорее всего, приведёт вас к полному уничтожению. Тут же стоит упомянуть, что, несмотря на необходимость отрисовывать сразу огромное количество боевых единиц, игра выглядит довольно симпатично; разумеется, модельки не слишком высокополигональны, да и текстуры не как в Crysis, но, благодаря великолепному дизайну, это совершенно не бросается в глаза.

Третья отличительная черта Планетарной Аннигиляции - межпланетарный и орбитальный геймплей. Как я упоминал раньше, полем боя может являться целая солнечная система из 2-5 планет каждая из которых открыта для колонизации. Выиграть битву, всю игру оставаясь на одной лишь планете, практически невозможно, ведь освоение новых земель позволяет вам в разы увеличить приток ресурсов, а также даёт вам дополнительный путь отступления в случае, если что-то вдруг пойдёт не по плану. Перемещение между планетами происходит либо с помощью орбитальных юнитов, либо с помощью порталов (которые сперва необходимо построить, а для этого также требуется либо транспорт, либо орбитальный строитель).

И, наконец, четвёртая основная особенность - это, собственно говоря, планетарная аннигиляция. Игроку позволяется уничтожать целые планеты, эффектно и мощно заканчивая игру. Вы можете построить на луне двигатели, сдвинуть её с орбиты и столкнуть с планетой, вызывая колоссальные разрушения, или же (на некоторых картах) воспользоваться Катализатором - местной вариацией Звезды Смерти. Что первый, что второй вариант требуют огромного вливания средств и времени, так что вам придётся хорошо потрудиться, чтобы осуществить один из них. Не стоит забывать, что и противник не станет сидеть сложа руки и покорно ждать своего конца; враги будут всячески мешать вам претворить свои планы в жизнь, так что будьте готовы вести боевые действия сразу на нескольких планетах.

В результате, Planetary Annihilation - это инновационная РТС, осмелюсь даже предположить, что это первая РТС следующего поколения, вводящая сразу несколько нигде ранее не виданных идей, главной из которых, на мой взгляд, являются сферические карты. Возможно, такой подход скоро станет классическим, хотя мне и не верится, что поклонники и разработчики стратегий в скором времени откажутся от привычных плоских карт... В любом случае, если вы ищете чего-нибудь нового в этом старом жанре, вам определённо стоит приглядеться к Планетарной Аннигиляции, вполне вероятно, это - именно то, что вам нужно. | Hello Commander,

Il est temps de produire un rapport dévaluation à 500 heures de jeu passées.


Concernant les aspects positifs :

-Gameplay dynamique
-Choix stratégiques multiples
-Cartes de jeu multiples à 360° 
-Simple à prendre en main
-Editeur de cartes
-Système d'équipes appréciable et original


Concernant les aspects négatifs :

-Une réalisation qui peine à avancer
-Un nombre élevé de bugs
-Un éventail de construction en jeu qui peine à évoluer
-Des fonctions techniques comme le Social ou les Lobby manquant d'optimisation


Pour synthétiser :

Un jeu prometteur aux aspects originaux dont la réalisation se fait attendre. Nul besoin d'en faire une description complète puisque certains fan sites ou encore d'autres community hubs l'ont fait. Il est important de souligner la grande originalité de ce jeu, au travers des aspects très appréciés des joueurs comme les cartes à 360°. Originalité qui ne manque pas de s'inscrire dans l'identité de Total Annihilation grâce à son style artistique et la manière dont le joueur évolue au sein des parties. Par ailleurs, l'engouement des joueurs se porte davantage sur ce qui va être réalisé que sur ce qui est déjà réalisé.

En conclusion, une communauté impatiente de découvrir un Planetary Annihilation finalisé. Un enthousiasme qui connait quelques déceptions et à juste titre. Ce sont plus de 2,000,000 $ collectés pour le lancement du jeu dont la réalisation était initialement prévue pour fin 2013. Six mois plus tard, il est consternant de constater un Lobby qui n'est toujours pas optimisé mettant à rude épreuve la patience des joueurs. Ne parlons pas des bugs connus en jeu et non résolus depuis des mois. Pour compenser tout cela les développeurs ont implanté ""The Galactic War Single Player"" ce qu'ils appellent une ""Big Rock feature"". Mais on ne remplace pas le sel par le poivre, surtout que la Galactic War ne propose qu'une évolution linéaire et monotone de votre conquête : déplacement banal sur la carte de campagne, un ""Tech tree"" qui porte plus sur une restriction qu'une extension de vos technologies, une IA en difficulté maximale qui se plie à votre volonté en moins de 10 minutes. Planetary Annihilation a une base de jeu solide mais qui ne saurait tarder à céder sous le poids d'un éventuel laxisme de la part des développeurs.

Bien à tous, 

Narah. | (EDIT: This review has been quite popular [Thanks for that, by the way], and I feel that in the interest of fairness I should mention that I have not played the Titans expansion, and I'm not going to, such is my dissappointment with this game. But it does perhaps bypass some of the problems I have raised here, I just don't particularly want to waste my money on it.)

I wanted so much to love this game. I'm a huge SupCom and TA fan, and this game looked like it was going to be the game that I was playing every day for the next couple of years. But after a while things were starting to look pretty bad, I came back online for the first time in a while to see if things have picked up. The game is still a very bland and repetetive experience. As an RTS all of the authentic strategy is in the first 5 minutes of each game, and then it's just who can push the most build capacity.

Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is, in my opinion, the best RTS game ever made. It's basic mechanics are excellent, the need for map control, economy management, unit management, tech management and intel are all closely interdependent, meaning that you're always INVOLVED in the battlefield even during the ""quiet"" stretches of gameplay. The available maps are excellent, and if you play on Forged Alliance Forever, a community maintained lobby with a competetive 1v1 ladder and public match service for casual players, there are stacks more to download. The game was also beautiful, with a good spread of aesthetically and strategically unique factions from the bread and butter ""space marines"" UEF, the intel oriented guerillas Cybran, the overrun focussed Aeon, and the tech heavy Seraphim. The game progression from opening to endgame is multifaceted and calls for real-time responses to your opponenents activity. To this day after 5 years of playing Forged Alliance if anybody tells me they're looking to get into a new competetive game I tell them to get FA. Similar things can be said of Total Annihilation, PA's other direct predecessor.

PA takes the ""massive-scale"" RTS format, and turns the format into an (ironically) incredibly two-dimensional experience. The units are bland and there is no faction diversity, the game escalates quickly but when it gets to its peak it tends to degenerate into a massive drag, especially across multiple planets with player interaction at a minimum, with power plays limited to a very uninteresting blob vs blob. Defensive plays just don't mean much in this game after a point. Your point defence investments will be thrown out for the sake of producing ever more units in the ongoing drudgery that is the endless escalation in this game. It sounds and is pretty cool the first few times you play it, but then you have your 10th game, and you realise you're doing more or less the same thing you did in the last 9, except there's a lava planet in this system, cool! But aside from your units not being able to drive over lakes of lava, that means very little. it's just forced no mans land. Interplanetary warfare epitomizes this. Build lots of orbital defences, build lots of fighters and send them at your opponents defences, wait 5 minutes for the fleet to arrive, hope it works, maybe send some fabricators to teleport an army from your planet to that one. I've done it so many times and I just don't really want to any more.

Huge scope for escalation in an RTS is cool, but you can't build a game on sheer escalation, which is what this is. There is no nuance, deploying a small force well is almost never going to make a game-changing difference, to the point where it's not worth trying, better stick to what you know. The learning curve is too steep as it is to try subtle strategies as a new player, and once you get to grips with the game you realise that there is very little to be done outside of beating your opponent in an arms race.

The game was released unready, and is just generally a very poor execution of a great concept, centred around a gimmick which doesn't come into play that often. My one hope for the game is that some modders come along and take the good (but extremely temperamental) engine and inject some life into it, the elements are there, but Uber half assed it, and just made the most nondescript RTS they could, and then made it really big and really long... and really fucking boring. | You want to know about Planetary Annihilation?

First, Uber shit in their community's collective faces by abandoning Planetary Annihilation as a bug-ridden, incomplete piece of garbage further made up of disappointment and empty promises. 

Second, they removed Planetary Annihilation from the Steam store entirely, further signalling their abandonment of the game, while simultaneously releasing their new full-price repackaging of the same game with the updates and content you always wanted (Planetary Annihilation: TITANS).

Third, after months of nothing but negative reviews and angry backlash from their community, they've inexplicably READDED the original Planetary Annihilation to Steam...For almost the same price as their repackaged game with more content!

Up and coming developers take note: THIS IS HOW YOU DON'T MAKE A GAME.

Curious potential buyers take note: Don't buy this game. There is the possibility of course that you might glean a couple hours of entertainment from it, but in the end it won't be worth the waste of your money or time. If you want a good RTS to play, pick up Starcraft 2 and its expansions, or Greygoo, or Company of Heroes, or Endless Legend. Just don't buy this game, Uber doesn't deserve your money. If I still haven't convinced you and you're still determined to try it, don't waste your money. Pirate this piece of trash instead. | Remember Rome: Total War? Taking over a continent with large scale armies was great. Watching hundreds of arrows arching into a tightly packed phalanx, breaking it up just before the distracting charge from your Swordsmen forced them out of position so your Cavalry could break through the side. What a game. 

I believe this is the next best thing. In terms of scale, it is crazy! Most matches have the potential to see orbital engagements, with Commander units fleeing the battle torn main planet in search of refuge. A nearby moon makes for a better base than the distant planet. Once secure, the moon is turned into a war factory, pumping out robots and tanks into a teleporter to be fed back into the foothold left on the starting planet. Then, just as your waves and waves of units seem to be breaking the enemy line of defense, they nuke your teleporter and push you completely off the planet! 

But all is not lost... You move every construction unit into the production of Halleys - giant rockets that can move small planets out of orbit... All the while inter-planetary nukes harass your anti-nuke defense and orbital units flood into your atmosphere trying to break through. But you manage to hold on just long enough to finish building your Moon of Doom, and it is time to quickly flee with your commander to the unoccupied planet. 

Now comes the fun as your push the moon into a new orbit of the sun; one which intersects with the orbit of the home planet - now riddled with machines of war, eager to break out and destroy you. However, without a foothold on the moon, nor an attempt at collonising the distant planet, your enemy has no where to go, and can only watch as a multi million ton projectile, hurled through space, smashes into his base, obliterating the planet, triggering the destruction of their Commander unit, and knocking them out of the game.

Yeah it's fun :D I just need someone to play with :(

Multiplayer is where it is at, as unlike most strategy games, you can play as the same colour, sharing controlling of the same units, as well as team up. What's more, unique game modes like 1v3v3v3 can be played due to the dedicated servers, whereby the aim of the game is to knock out the solo player who has a production bonus. Almost like a race to break into the fortress!

76561197999259031,247020,"Cook, Serve, Delicious!",7.35,"Action, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",5,"This game is the shit and the store description is quite honest. A bit grindy on first playthrough but progresses much faster on NG+. I enjoy it despite having played the later CSD games and appreciating their different mechanical approaches to the same dishes and events, and I don't think the three games are truly redundant. The game is written much more seriously overall than the later games as well, though that's saying surprisingly little and ultimately the story is inconsequential here.

Game is soundly assembled and balanced and all the dishes are worth consideration. You will build a lot of keyboard APM playing this game and memorizing combos for further optimizations, though I know of those who prefer joystick controls and are nonetheless quite skilled. 

Everything looks and sounds delicious, and almost inspiring, for drawings and exaggerated sound clips but yeah a lot of recipes get oversimplified. You're going to be cooking entire lasagnas and entire pots of soup for individual patrons. I recommend that you don't buy blue stars until you beat the game. | [i]Cook, Serve, Delicious![/i] in one word: FAAASTERRR

This game is full of keyboard action and plays a lot like those niche typing games. But instead of reading and typing words, you're reading dish orders and inputting corresponding hotkeys at blistering pace and superb accuracy. And yes, you can customize hotkeys for all the dishes, which is pretty sweet. However, there are some notable limitations: the key to serve a dish has to be Enter, and you can only use letters, so [];',. etc. aren't allowed.

Every day that you do well, you get ""buzz"", i.e. the game speeds up. There's no significant bonus related to this other than that you get more customers and earn more money. Most importantly, it makes the game speed fit your skill level. So this is just good game design.

The game also has great humor. If you stay a bit in the intro, you get people saying Cook, Serve, Delicious in every way possible. The e-mails you receive every day are full of character and humor as well.

All that is to say, these developers really know what they're doing, and I look forward to getting 100% for this game! | It's funny going back how much simpler this is than its sequels
Not that that's bad | Very fun and enjoyable typing game, that makes good use of ingenious mechanics to add complexity to an otherwise simple concept. I especially liked how some recipes created a different flow on the keyboard, while presenting unique challenges you had to overcome. 

(I only played on extreme so the experience might be different on normal)

Pros:
- simple and easy to navigate UI (there are some weird menu interactions like how you have to go to the ""View/Buy Foods"" tab to test recipes, but there aren't that many and you get used to it)
- straightforward gameplay that also needs a bit of strategy to play well
- good humor
- music
- diverse and fun recipe cards
- challenging (I wouldn't say it's especially hard but you need to be able to touch type to have a good time)
- not annoying to get all achievements

Cons:
- a few annoying bugs (mostly in the UI)
- becomes repetitive after a while (especially the final star rating)
- difficulty is somewhat inverse if you play on extreme because you don't have any upgrades in the beginning
 - you can't discard a dish to redo it if you failed (its annoying when you miss a perfect day because your hand slipped and added the wrong ingredient in a single soup from like 100+ orders) | A very fun game. It can get a little dull when you have low buzz and consequently very few customers, then the next day you'll be mashing keys like crazy to get through a mad rush. Cool music and overall a great experience."
76561197999259031,247350,Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator,5.983333333333333,"Action, Indie, Simulation",0,"Artemis is a diamond in the rough. It's very much unlike any other space sim I've ever played. The game has you play a starship bridge officer, responsible for controlling one of the ship's systems. Pretty cool and all, but there's a twist. In most space sims, a player is responsible for running the whole ship. He controls the weapons, he directs the ship to its destination, and so on. Artemis is different in that each of the ship's systems are run by other players. The bridge crew is entirely composed of humans, not AI.

There are five stations to man in Artemis: Helm, Engineering, Weapons, Science and Comms. Helm controls the ship's movement. Engineering deals with repairs and modifying the power levels of each system in the ship. Weapons handles, well, weapons and shields. Science has control over the sensors, scanning targets for information on its systems and crew. Comms handles communication with other vessels, both friend and foe.

This 5-man setup provides a lot of depth to the game, but it is not difficult to learn by any means. The actual mechanics behind the workings of each system are surprisingly simple to learn. The genius of Artemis is how the mechanics of all these systems work together to form a complete, compelling experience for everyone involved. All crew members need to have good synergy if they want to complete the mission. As long as you keep up a friendly attitude, pay attention to your fellow crewmates and do your part to keep the ship running, you will have a high chance of success.

Originally, the game could only be purchased through the developer's website. It could only be played through LAN, and it cost 40 bucks, because that version came with extra copies to be played on other computers for a full LAN party. LAN play is fun as hell, but that alone doesn't make for much mass appeal. Fortunately, the developers have realized this and have added online play. The Steam version of the game costs a mere 8 bucks, because it's only one copy. A dirt cheap price for what could be an endless amount of fun with friends? That's a steal.

If you're going to play online, you'll need to get a program called Teamspeak to communicate with other players. There is a teamspeak server that is decently populated for most of the day. IPs for servers can be found there. Its address is artemis.teamspeak3.com and its password is Artemis1. The community is very friendly, supportive, and a whole lot of fun to play with.

Give Artemis a shot. This game deserves a lot more attention. It really is unlike any other space sim on the market. It's about as close to being in Star Trek as you can get. I'll see you in Starfleet. | Artemis is a fantastic game, best played with friends, in the same room.  I know that many people play it on a VPN, but there's nothing quite like all playing together.  Drinking encouraged, almost required, for maximum enjoyment.

The game is low-to-medium hardware intensity;  whatever machine is running the Main Viewer should have a decent video card, and be comfortable with multiple outputs if a laptop.  One of our players successfully plays with nothing more than an iPad.  Support since 2.0 has improved dramatically.

The biggest issue is players not knowing the nuances of their individual roles, and what buttons are where (since they've moved since 1.6). | ""It's Star Trek, Jim, but not as we know it"".

Don't go in expecting the full Star Trek experience because you will be disappointed (unless you get a game master). However, if all you're looking for is joining a Starfleet ship, this game exceeds expectations and then some.

What you see is what you get: you and a group of friends fly a spaceship, each member getting their own interface.

While some interfaces may seem daunting due to the amount of information displayed (particularly engineering), each one of them is well designed and surprisingly intuitive; you'll get used to the controls rather quickly.

The gameplay is rather standard as far as Star Trek flight sim games go (mostly combat), but it does deliver this sense of belonging to a rich universe (even if the map is the size of a single solar system)

Speaking of solar systems, the world objects (or rather the lack of) are the only drawback of the game. Maybe I shouldn't expect much from game that takes up a quarter of a gig, but a couple of planets and moons wouldn't go amiss.

Overall, it's a great party game for those who love sci-fi. Just don't be caught on dreams of grandeur. | TO PLAY THIS GAME YOU NEED:
1 PC to act as the server. One player can also run the game client on this PC and man a station.
Up to 6 crew member devices per ship. They each need their own device (PC, iOS or Android). They each mann a station - helm, weapons, engineering, comms, science etc.
You can have 1 or more ships. Ships can be on the same team or competing.
You need at least 2 players per ship. You always need 1 server running.

CAN I PLAY ONLINE?
The game is designed to be played on the same LAN (WiFi network) and it is super easy to do so. You can, however, play with folks online but this requires port forwarding or Hamachi to set up.

Hope this cleared that up for you.

IS THE GAME FUN?
Yeah it's mint. Feels like Star Trek. Accessible too - I played with my parents and sister, who are not sci-fi fans, and they all loved it. | QUICK DISCLAIMER: Ignore my hours of playtime as reported by Steam. I have played a few times and most of the time I am running the EXE outside of Steam. I probably have several hours of game time now.

This game is a little buggy, a little uneven, and does not feel like it's yet been fully realized. Having said that, I can still fully and wholeheartedly recommend it, but with  a few caveats that I will get to later. The bottom line is: this game is so much fun! Seriously, if you are into, or were ever into Star Trek then you owe it to yourself to get it. Artemis is a simulation of what it might be like to be part of the bridge crew on a starship like the Enterprise. 

Here's how it works: You run one instance of the game as a server and then each player (up to six for a full bridge crew) runs another instance and those clients connect to the server. Each player picks one or more stations to manage (captain, helm, tactical, engineering, science, and communications) and each station gets its own interface needed to perform its functions to run the ship. So the helm gets a control layout to be able to fly the ship, engineering gets controls to manage power to various systems and mitigate damage, and the tactical officer gets to fire the weapons. The captain ties it all together, making decisions and issuing orders to other crew members. The captain has his own view which is a map with some basic information, or s/he can simply use the main view screen which is provided by the server.

The developer clearly intended originally that this game would be played by people all in the same room and the simulation lends itself well to LARPing and role-playing. An ideal setup would be all six players in the same room using their own machines and whichever machine is running the server (any one of the machines could run the server and one of the clients--you DO NOT need a separate machine and/or copy of the game to play) would be connected to a big screen tv to show the main screen. Thankfully, the latest version of the game allows for playing over the internet. My gaming group uses Skype for voice chat since the game provides no native voice chat. It works fine for us.

The server is what runs the actual simulation and it allows for setting up various scenarios in the game and tweaking all sorts of parameters to increase or decrease difficulty. The are various sorts of ally and enemy ships to encounter and bases to dock with and defend. The game has modes for multiple ships with their own crews that can go head-to-head or do missions cooperatively. One server can support up to 36 players (six bridges with each having their own crews of up to 6 players).

Each role has different things to do to keep the ship running smoothly. Admittedly, some stations are more fun to play than others. Also, some stations feel very heavy on the micro-managing and others feel like there's not much to do; many people complain about the communications station for being sort of thin in this area. I actually don't mind playing Communications Officer You can hail friendly or enemy ships, monitor distress calls from friendly bases or ships being attacked, demand that enemy ships surrender, taunt enemy ships into attacking, direct friendly ships away from deadly areas of space, order friendly ships to attack, prepare bases for docking to improve refuel and rearm performance. And most importantly, you have the button to set off the red alert klaxon. As Communications Officer, you may also get side quests from friendly forces which usually take the form of, ""Dock with this base to download this data, then take it to this friendly ship and then come back and dock with use to get more energy/coolant/weapons/etc.""

So once again, I do recommend this game if you have at least two friends to play with. You DO NOT need six people to play this game. At the very least, you need helm, tactical, and engineering, but personally, I like playing with five or six people. Also, as I said before, the game has no native voice chat if you are going to playing over the internet. Something else to be aware of is that the game does nothing for you in terms of matchmaking or anything like that. You'll need to have each player connect to the server via IP address and you'll need to set up port forwarding on TCP 2010 to be able to have any of the clients be able to connect. One other gotcha to to be aware that when you play over the internet, you won't be able to use the IP address of the server that is reported in the game. That IP will only work when playing over a LAN. You'll need your internet-facing IP address to hand out to the players for connecting to the server.

 I bought the six pack and gave the five other copies to my gaming group. I've had fun playing this game over the internet as well as all in the same room. It's a lot of fun especially if you have a madcap gang to play with like I do.

I just hope the developer continues to work on this game. It's good already but it feels like it could go a lot farther."

Você morre pelo seu erros e aprende com isso. Tempo de duração ideal | Mark of the Ninja: Remastered is an absolute masterclass in stealth gameplay, blending fluid movement, strategic decision-making, and a beautifully stylized presentation into one of the best 2D stealth experiences ever made. Whether you're a stealth game veteran or a newcomer to the genre, this game is a must-play.

The controls are incredibly smooth and responsive, allowing you to sneak, climb, and take down enemies with precision. Every movement feels intentional, and the game gives you complete control over how you approach each level—whether you choose to remain completely unseen or take down every enemy methodically. The variety of tools and abilities at your disposal, from distraction items to lethal assassination techniques, ensures that every encounter feels dynamic.

The level design is superb, offering multiple paths, secret areas, and creative ways to eliminate or avoid enemies. The game rewards patience and planning, but it never feels punishing, thanks to generous checkpointing and intuitive mechanics that encourage experimentation.

The hand-drawn art style is stunning, with smooth animations and striking lighting effects that emphasize the importance of shadows and visibility. The sound design is equally impressive, using audio cues to enhance the tension and make sneaking through levels even more immersive.

The remastered edition polishes an already fantastic game, improving textures, animations, and adding higher fidelity visuals while maintaining the game’s signature aesthetic. The inclusion of the Special Edition content, which adds an extra level and developer commentary, makes it an even better package.

With its brilliant stealth mechanics, engaging progression system, and stylish presentation, Mark of the Ninja: Remastered is an essential title for anyone who enjoys tactical, skill-based gameplay.

Rating: 9.5/10 – One of the best stealth games ever made, now even better. | Mark of the Ninja’s core strengths and weaknesses largely stem from the same source. MOTN is a pretty simple game on the mechanical side, taking most of the core features of other stealth games and condensing them into a 2d environment. This approach has its benefits –there’s a much greater degree of visual clarity for environments and enemies and players are less likely to be screwed over by weird physics issues– but it also limits what the game is capable of.

Having access to so much information reduces tension and the enemies aren’t observant enough to balance things out. Meanwhile, navigating a 2d space is far simpler than a 3d one making traversal through the levels feel a lot less varied compared to other major stealth titles as there are few unconventional or hidden approaches that it's possible to take. It makes for a game that’s quite easy to learn and pick up (good considering its short runtime) but with a low skill ceiling. I played nonlethally and with none of the optional abilities but still managed to get max rank on nearly every level without much difficulty.

The picture is the same when looking at MOTN’s stealth mechanics. There’s a decent variety of items and abilities you can use to supplement your starting kit, but aside from the tutorial sections where they’re introduced none of these additions are required or even feel well-integrated with the rest of the gameplay. Rather than expanding how you can approach the game, they feel more like a means of bypassing challenges entirely.

If you’re struggling to sneak past a guard, you can lure them away with a distraction or temporarily blind them with a flash grenade. If you come across a laser trap, rather than finding a way around it or disabling the trap by finding its power source, you could also just toss a smoke bomb which disables the lasers until the smoke dissipates. For a game that's already quite easy, the upgrades far outpace the increased difficulty of the enemies and levels such that MOTN gets easier rather than harder the further your progress until you’re near the very end of the game. Most of the ways the game gets more difficult (stronger enemies in particular) don’t even come into play if you’re sneaky enough not to get caught so there’s very little added challenge between the beginning and the mid/late game. 

There is a decent foundation here, but it's clearly lacking. The only way to get more variety is to sacrifice difficulty, meanwhile the base game never feels so hard that bypassing the challenges ever felt necessary or even desirable. For any semi-skilled player you’ll essentially be playing the whole game with nothing but the tools you get at the very start plus one ability that unlocks near the end. And while the enemy placements and level design are good enough that the limited toolset is still enjoyable to use, once you start to learn the patterns and get a feel for how the designers intend for you to solve something, it's not hard to actually execute it.

But while I complain that MOTN is too easy overall, it still has some elements that feel quite unfair to deal with and make some portions of the game needlessly difficult or frustrating to deal with. There’s a heavy emphasis on sticking to the shadows to avoid detection, but at the same time the game does a poor job at distinguishing between light and dark areas. Your current position is easy to tell –when standing in light your character will be in full color, but when in the dark they’ll only be pictured in black and white– but when moving to another spot it can be hard to tell, especially in outdoor areas. A spot can look bright but not be considered bright enough that you can be detected in them (or vice versa, but to a lesser extent). While in the darkness, enemies can only see you when you’re in their vision cone but if you’re in the light they can see from wherever they’re standing as long as they’re facing the correct way. So stepping into the light can easily be a death sentence but without a reliable way of distinguishing between the two it places an unnecessary amount of risk onto any player movements, encouraging you to take alternate routes that are more certain but also more boring.

There are a few frustrating technical issues as well. Checkpoints were handled quite poorly, sometimes respawning me directly into an enemy’s line of light and forcing me to either continue with the alarm raised or restart the whole level. Controls were also awkward when playing with Keyboard+Mouse as the game would sometimes disregard my mouse and give me the Keyboard prompt for something instead (Entering a hiding spot, for example, is E on the keyboard or right click on the mouse, but if I walked up to it using WASD then the game prompted me to use E since it recognizes I’m using a keyboard instead of right click since I still have a mouse). And the game binds too many actions to each key with many interactions (moving/dropping a body, entering a hiding spot, pulling a switch, etc) all using the same prompt which often meant doing something I didn’t intend because the game changed what it was indicating my button press would do at the last second.

And just to mention it, the story is fine. It’s serviceable as a way of contextualizing your actions but it's pretty simple and predictable so there isn’t any reason to get invested.

MOTN is still a decent game and I recommend it if you just want to kill a few hours. It has enough going on to keep you invested in the moment-to-moment without ever being overwhelming and, while hardly compared to the genre’s greats, the stealth mechanics are fun to engage with. It’s hardly a game that will stick in my mind for too long but I don’t regret my time with it.

76561197999259031,239070,Hammerwatch,1.5,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG",0,"A decent game, but with some pretty frustrating flaws.

Permadeath is super annoying in a co-op. Losing all your progress and then playing through the exact same dungeon again is super demotivating. We tried playing with infinite lives, but then it trivialized the game -- there was no penalty at all for death.

Also, the fact that every player controls every menu simultaneously led to a let of misclicks. My partner opened a vendor while I was attacking things, and my button press bought something for them. Worse, later they paused the game while I was attacking things, and my button press quit the game. There wasn't even an ""are you sure?"" dialog, it just immediately quit and we lost everything. This tipped it into thumbs down for me. | es ist ein tolles spiel das mich meine ganze Kindheit begleitet hat ich rate euch das Spiel zu kaufen !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | Amazing modern version of gauntlet, love the pixel art and crt filters | A campanha principal é um dos melhores Dungeon Crawleres que eu já joguei, só que depois que saiu o Heroes deu pra ver que a mecânica é bem limitada.

76561197999259031,233840,Worms Clan Wars,0.11666666666666667,Strategy,1,"Worms Clan Wars ist ein solider Worms-Teil. Wie fast immer ist es ein rundenbasiertes Strategiespiel. Clan Wars bietet insgesamt mit 65 unterschiedlichen Waffen oder Werkzeug eine Menge Spaß, um die Würmer in die Luft zu jagen. Der Story-Modus hat eine angenehme Schwierigkeit, sodass auch Spieler, die nicht so gut in dem Spiel sind es schaffen können. Hierbei sind leider auch paar Bugs entstanden wie zum Beispiel, das ein Mechanismus in der Kampagne nicht geöffnet wird, aber nicht allzu schlimm, eher witzig als ärgerlich, genauso wie im Multiplayer mit der Wasserphysik, wo es ebenfalls zu Problemen kommen kann, siehe die YouTuber Pietsmiet, wo ich das Spiel hauptsächlich kennengelernt habe. Schlechter als die Jungs dort kann man eigentlich nicht sein ^^. Die Würmer können unterschiedliche Fähigkeiten haben. Diese unterscheiden sich in dicker Wurm, schlauer Wurm, kleiner Wurm und den ganz normalen Wurm, der Granaten mit der Leertaste schon früher zünden kann. Die Erfahrung zeigt, dass die dicken Würmer die besten sind meiner Meinung nach, da sie viel mehr Schaden anrichten können, der einzige Nachteil ist das diese ziemlich Träge und schwer vom Fleck zu bekommen sind. Generell fühlt sich das ganze Spiel eher langsamer an als die Vorgänger. Der langsamste Worms-Teil den ich bis hier gespielt habe im Vergleich zu Worms 1, Armageddon, Reloaded & W.M.D. Zusätzlich gibt es die Worms Ops Missionen, wo unterschiedliches Präzision gefragt ist mit unterschiedlichen Waffen und Werkzeugen. Der Humor ist klasse und die Musik ist auch typisch Worms. Dein eigenes Team bzw. Clan kann individuell angepasst werden mit unterschiedlichen Hüten und so weiter. Der größte Spaß liegt wie in allen Worms-Ablegern beim Multiplayer. Es entstehen immer so viele lustige Momente, die man einfach nicht vorher besser planen könne. Von mir ein Daumen hoch für ein witziges Worms-Spiel. | El Juego no se siente Fluido, hagas lo que hagas.  LAMENTABLE 1999 desde el mejor worms - 2025 decenas de copias y Clan Wars NO VA FLUIDO ni cuando salio ni a dia de hoy.

Funciona perfeitamente no Steam Deck. | Metal Slug 3 is a masterpiece that stands the test of time, delivering an unforgettable arcade experience that combines fast-paced action, stunning pixel art, and a sense of humor that keeps players coming back for more. This game is not just a run-and-gun shooter; it’s a celebration of everything that makes retro gaming so special.

From the moment you start playing, the vibrant and detailed pixel art grabs your attention. Every frame is packed with personality, from the exaggerated animations of your character to the chaotic explosions and quirky enemy designs. The variety of environments is astounding, taking you from lush jungles and icy tundras to alien-infested spaceships. Each level feels unique and brimming with creativity, ensuring that the gameplay never becomes repetitive.

The gameplay itself is tight and responsive, offering a perfect balance of challenge and fun. The controls are simple yet incredibly satisfying, allowing you to pull off precise movements and attacks even in the most chaotic situations. The addition of multiple routes in certain levels adds a layer of replayability, encouraging players to explore every nook and cranny to uncover hidden secrets and power-ups.

One of the standout features of Metal Slug 3 is its sheer variety. The game constantly throws new surprises at you, whether it’s transforming into a zombie, riding a camel, or piloting a submarine. The weaponry is equally diverse, with each gun offering a unique way to decimate your enemies. And let’s not forget the iconic Metal Slug vehicles, which are an absolute blast to control and add an extra layer of excitement to the gameplay.

The humor and charm of Metal Slug 3 are unmatched. The game doesn’t take itself too seriously, and it’s filled with hilarious moments, from the over-the-top death animations to the absurdity of fighting giant crabs and aliens. This lighthearted approach makes the game incredibly endearing and adds to its replay value.

The co-op mode is where Metal Slug 3 truly shines. Playing with a friend doubles the fun and chaos, creating unforgettable moments of teamwork and laughter. It’s a testament to the game’s design that it remains just as enjoyable whether you’re playing solo or with a partner.

In conclusion, Metal Slug 3 is a timeless classic that every gamer should experience. Its perfect blend of action, humor, and creativity makes it a standout title in the run-and-gun genre. Whether you’re a longtime fan or a newcomer, this game is guaranteed to leave you with a smile on your face and a desire to hit that restart button. A true 10/10 masterpiece!"
76561197999259031,250700,Super Time Force Ultra,0.0,"Action, Indie",0,"Super Time Force Ultra is a really simple but fun concept and has an awesome sense of humor. I would recommend this game for anyone looking for simple fun that doesn't require a huge time commitment.

You play through a level with whatever character as though you're trying to complete the level. You will either run out of time or get killed at some point. At that point in time you get to ""time shift"" or basically rewind your play as much as you'd like (all the way to the beginning of the level if you'd like). You then will start playing again, but the old ""ghost"" version of you will play EXACTLY like you played before. So if you ran ahead and killed guys, your ghost will do that again and you wouldn't need to kill them this time. If you happen to kill whatever killed your last guy, you can ""rescue"" them.

Each character has a charged shot that you have to charge up but in most cases deals more damage/etc. If you rescue a formerly killed team member, you'll then get their charged ability, so you'd then be using two at once from then on out.

The replay-ability comes in from collecting glorbs (golden orbs) in each level, collecting the time slow downs and then trying to get through the level really fast. Each of these will unlock a character. After beating the game you unlock some puzzles as well as a ""harder"" super hardcore mode.

Super Hardcore Mode is not significantly harder, but if a character dies, you can't use them again, so it does pose an additional challenge.

Overall, I will keep this game installed and pop back in and play it years from now as its such a simple and fun concept and the game has a really good sense of humor about the time travelling going on. Basically your team is there to ""save"" history and by that, it means re-write it in any way it sees fit.

Give it a shot, it's a fun one and unlike anything else I've ever played!"

[b][u]Go Go Pixel Rangers![/u][/b]

Die Kämpfe in Chroma Squad finden [b]rundenweise auf einem rasterbasierten Schlachtfeld[/b] statt. Gegner und Helden machen abwechselnd ihren Zug. Hierbei sind die Helden stets die ersten. Sowohl Gegner als auch Helden haben spezifische [b]Eigenschaften[/b] wie Laufweite und ein spezifisches Skillset, das bei den Helden durch deren Ausrüstung und Klasse bestimmt wird. Oft kommt auch der obligatorische [b]Riesenrobo[/b] zum Einsatz, wenn der Boss nach der ersten Tracht Prügel über sich hinauswächst. Hier kommt ein Combosystem zum Einsatz, das einen (theoretisch unendlich oft) mit wachsender Kraft angreifen lässt. Allerdings wird es immer schwerer einen Treffer zu landen, da das Zeitfenster für das Timing immer kleiner wird. Abschlussangriffe beenden die Combo zwar, werden aber immer stärker je nach dem wie viele Treffer die Combo beinhaltet. Ein Mal zu verfehlen bedeutet natürlich, dass die Combo endet und mitunter Kontert der Schurke dann auch noch, bevor er einen Angriff startet.

[b][u]Echte Helden brauchen keine Level-Ups? Ist das dann noch ein RPG?[/u][/b]

In Croma Squad gibt es keine Level-Ups für das Vertrimmen von möglichst vielen Gegnern. Stattdessen werden mit jedem Kapitel zwei oder drei neue [b]Skills[/b] freigeschaltet, aus denen man wählen kann. Jeder Held hat einen eigenen Skillbaum. Klassische RPG Mechaniken finden sich hier keine.


[u][b]Gut gekauft ist besser als schlecht selbst gebastelt[/b][/u]

Zwischendurch werden die Streiter der Erde stärker durch [b]Ausrüsung[/b], sei sie nun gekauft oder gebastelt. In der Regel ist die gekaufte allerdings besser, weil Ressourcen teils knapp sind und teuer in [b]""Mystery Boxen""[/b] (Random Items) nachgekauft werden müssen und weil selbst gemachte Ausrüstung oft zufällige Eigenschaften hat. Für die Aufrüstung des [b]Riesenrobos[/b] gibt es nichts zu kaufen, aber die Eigenschaften der Bauteile ist vorgegeben und es stehen pro Körperteil drei Baureihen zur Auswahl.


[b][u]Teamwork und Effekte weil Einschaltquoten[/u][/b] 

Da die Kämpfe (zumindest Anfangs und für das Publikum) nur Schau sind und die eigene Arbeit von den [b]Einschaltquoten[/b] abhängt, muss man dem Zuschauer auch etwas bieten. So werden Spezialangriffe und Teamangriffe auch gern mal völlig unnötig gegen Kanonenfutter entfesselt und Teamkameraden abenteuerlich durch die Gegend geworfen, um den Zuschauer zu begeistern. Auch [b]Regieanweisungen[/b] spielen eine Rolle. Diese sind optionale Ziele wie etwa den Boss in jeder Runde mit einem spezifischen Charakter angreifen oder mal eben drei Gegner in einer Runde außer Gefecht setzen. Alles für die Einschaltquoten, denn diese resultieren am ""Ende der Folge"" in Geld und Fans.

Einen weniger direkten aber nicht zu unschätzenden Nutzen haben [b]Marketingagenturen[/b], die mit ihren verschiedenen Perks das Einkommen, die gewonnenen Fans oder auch Kampfwerte der Helden aufmotzen.

[*] Der (vor) letzte Boss ist künstlich erschwert.
[spoiler]Er spawnt ehemalige Bosse, von denen einer einen AOE beherrscht, der allen Helden schadet und im Nahkampf auch gegen Gruppen stark ist und einen Boss, der konstant in der Lage ist, andere Mobs zu spawnen.

[*] Was man sich beim Craftingsystem gedacht hat, ist mir ein Rätsel. Man hat BEGRENZTE Materialien, welche man zwar nachkaufen kann, aber auch nur in Form von ""Mystery-Boxes"" (zufällige Auswahl bestimmter Materialien) und Geld ist, bedingt durch die Begrenzte Menge an ""Missionen"", auch nur begrenzt vorhanden. Das gemeinsam mit einem Craftingsystem, in dem RNG-Kram eine große Rolle spielt stößt mich persönlich schon sehr ab. [/list]


[h1]Schwierigkeitsgrad[/h1]

Der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist in verschiedenen Stufen zu Beginn des Spiels einstellbar. Auf ""Mittel"" ist das Spiel seicht herausfordernd, ohne zu schwer zu sein. Außer der (vor) letzte Boss. 


[h1]Soundtrack, Grafik, Steuerung[/h1]

Der Soundtrack ist ziemlich gut gemacht und fängt den Charme des Settings einer Super Sentai Simulation gut ein.

[b]Fazit:[/b]

Chroma Squad ist eine humorvolle Hommage an das ""Super Sentai""- Genre, dessen bekanntester Ableger im europäischen Raum ""Power Rangers"" mich durch einen Teil meiner Kindheit begleitet hat, weshalb dieses Spiel ein Muss für mich war. Fans des Genre oder solche, die Erinnerungen damit verknüpfen sowie Freunde von Runden-Strategie. können hier zugreifen. Wer sich ein RPG mit Level-Ups und offener Welt erhofft, wird enttäuscht. Von mir gibt es eine Kaufempfehlung

It seems like the game has gotten worst with every version released in the last 3 years. It seems like the developers look at what players are doing and then deem it exploitative or just don't like it in general and change it. To summarize it, they don't like how the players are playing their game and they want them to play it how they (devs) want them to play it.
We went from alpha 12 creating sand molds for glass jars to now as of b25, no glass jars or containers or anything and want you to die of thirst on day one. We use to build underground and be safe, devs didn't like that and now the zombies dig. We then built air forts or off-ground bases, devs didn't like that and added physics to the blocks and coded zombies to attack the nearest support pillar to force collapse.
You use to build a small structure or clear and rehab a point of interest as a starting base after scouting for ones with forges or being near water. Devs didn't like that and now Poi's are deadly, and sometimes spawn zoms inside after placing your land claim block or bedroll. They marketed the game as a crafting survival game, but now have made it difficult to build and craft and forces you to loot all the time. 
You use to eat once and drink 3-4 times a day, devs didn't like that and now You're constantly starving and thirsty all the time. In alpha 12, you use to read books to unlock crafting or recipes and magazines to increase skills, the devs didn't like that and thought a skill point system would be better. They took the book/mags out in alpha 13-18 then reintroduced it in 19 to co-exist with the skill-point system, but now in b25, you need the books and mags to level up for everything.
You use to heal up and regain stamina after eating or drinking, and now you just a weak ass bitch, since food doesn't recover as much health and water is sparse. They cut down or remove quite bit of assets and gameplay from the game to simplify it and I think that has detracted from the game from it's earlier versions.
Now the fun pimps don't like the stealth mechanic and have null and negate it in the latest version.
That's just a fraction of the evolving changes. The game used to be pretty fun to now being such a total grind and chore, that I can't even stand it for 30 minutes before I quit out. 

I know what you're thinking, I'm complaining about how hardcore and difficult then contradict myself with them simplifying crafting and assets. But if you ever play the earlier versions, it wasn't as much of chore then as more of a realism and understanding basic build process, and it was quite fun. There was more to do. Going ""oh I need sand and clay, I need a jar for the mold, I need a forge, some metal or an anvil"" and put it all together to get 5 glass jars. Then I need water, pot and campfire. It was all obtainable and you had to manage it and it made it felt like you were trying to survive. 

Now it's like, you have to loot and get lucky, Do about 30 hits on a tree, block or door and now you're thirsty because you've exhausted your stamina repeatedly, so don't run or swing your club and avoid zombies, and hope you find water. It's a walking simulator with a looting mechanic. That's just bad game design. 

The Fun Pimps are not so fun, I think they are pure masochists that enjoy C&B Torture and they are making this game for those that enjoy that type of fetish. | 新版本更新后联机总是出现各种各样的问题。每次和朋友玩都是为了连接服务器花大量时间，往往还没开始正式玩就累了。 | 毎日過ごす中でなんかこうゾンビ倒したいなぁ、拠点作りたいなぁって
そんな気分になる時期があると思うんです
そしたらこのゲームをやれば良いんです
アプデの度にちょっとづつ仕様が変わるのも新鮮味があって好きです | 一応""おすすめ""と評価しますが、ゲームバランスはテスト版より悪化している印象です。

今作は所謂リアル版マインクラフトで、マイクラにも登場するゾンビが今作ではプレイヤーを脅かす最大の脅威という立ち位置です。
中でも今作屈指の特徴であるゲーム内時間一週間サイクルで発生する「フェラルホード」というイベントでは、ワールドウォーZやドーン・オブ・ザ・デッド並みのゾンビの大群がプレイヤーを襲う高難易度バトルとなっており、兎にも角にもゾンビとの死闘を繰り広げつつ終末世界での生存を維持し続けるサバイバルゲームとなっています。

然し一見高難易度のようで実はオプション設定で詳細を自由に変更可能な為、ランボープレイからステルス戦まで多岐にわたるプレイスタイルも踏まえ、かなり自由度の高いゲーム…でした。

問題なのは製品版以降の仕様変更。
自分はv1.2に復帰した身ですが、全体的にランボープレイを好む方に向けた調整が為されており、テスト版時代のような時々ゾンビを相手にする程度のまったりライフ♪や緊張感満載のスニーキングスタイル等が難しくなっています。
その理由はゾンビの仕様の再調整に尽き、「ゾンビの耐久度が大幅に強化」「汚染（高耐久）ゾンビが早々に登場」「クエスト中の強制発覚イベント増加」「貞子ゾンビ（増援役）の出現率強化」等、テスト版に比較して常時ゾンビとの戦闘が非常に多く、ひたすら無心でショットガン又はマシンガンで弾をばら撒くだけの作業が増してしまった。

一方テスト版時代からの欠点が複数放置されており、一本道ゲーの割に建物内部の構造が複雑で少しでも正規ルートから外れるとゾンビが発生せずクリア不可になるバグ、雑誌収集とかいう反吐が出そうな程ダルいスキルシステム、左右は聴き取れても上下の判定が存在しない音全般、ゾンビ発生の源であるHEAT値が炉・作業台等の日常アイテムにまで設けられている等々…。
加えてクエスト報酬はテスト版に比較して劣化している故、プレイキャラクターの育成・装備とゲームステージのレベルのバランスが取れておらず、良く言えばテスト版より歯応えが増した反面、より荒削りで、ストレスが募り易くなったと感じます。

それでも辛うじて「リアルなマインクラフト」的面白さ・自由度は保たれており、前半の苦行さえ乗り越えれば意外と楽しめます。
非公式MODも膨大な数存在しますが…こちらに関しては完全に自己責任で。 | Игра интересная, на часов 100 минимум точно займет вас. Единственное, что разрабы не фиксят моменты с прогрузкой карты, из за этого фпс жестко начинает проседать через несколько отыгранных часов на одной карте."
76561197999259031,251970,Unknown,2.55,,1,"[h1]Review for players interested in the game:[/h1]

I'm a veteran of Dota 1/2 and League of Legends. I say this not to brag, but to let those of you know that this review is critiqued by a person who has been playing this genre of game for years. 

[b]NOTE:[/b]This game was originally put out in an Alpha state to help test some of the mechanics and fine tone the game, and it has caused a mixed review setting, but I can tell you NOW as of May 2015 the game is well made, and a worthy entry into the MOBA genre.

Let's go over some of the pros and cons for this game! 

As of May 2015

[list]PROS:
[*] It has an extremely customizable matchmaking system. You can have five different search ""playlists"" which can be customized heavily. Want to have a solo playlist with EU friends? Make it. Want to have an unranked playlist to practice or get quick games in? Covered. Want a PvP ranked playlist? Done. 
[*] Like smartcast? Normal cast? Quick cast? They more than have you covered. Within the keybinding settings is an option to not only do individual heroes, but each individual skill. Want your heroes ultimate to be quick cast while your hero's Q be a smartcast? You can do that. It's a fantastic piece of user interaction that is done better than basically every other MOBA.
[*] 5v5 matches include a special series of world quests that happen every 8 minutes. These world quests are objectives that can be completed by EITHER side in a competition style format that can FORCE teamfights, and/or give one side an advantage. The enemy team getting more kills then you? Try to level it out by working with your team to complete the world quests before the enemy team and start regaining ground. Quests can include things like transporting a chest across map for bonus gold, or ones that give special items to disable towers. 
[*] The business model. The business model in this game is exceptionally well done. Hate grinding for months to get all the champions in league? Don't worry, all heroes are available from the start similar to DOTA, and the main venue for money that this game gets is through cosmetic skins. Unlike many other F2P games you can not simply buy power. 
[*] Like playing a support, but hate never getting any gold to buy items? There is a percentage of gold share in this game similar to how Dawngate worked. Supports can gain gold by assisting in kills, assisting in quests objectives, and doing lethal / non-lethal damage to creeps.
[*] There is a gear and crafting system which utilizes recipes and materials gained from matches. The gear works in similar way to runes in LoL, with some special pieces slightly changing the effects of a specific heroes abilities. The crafting system also applies to skins, so if you gather the recipe and related materials for a skin you can simply craft it to use. Retired skins that are no longer sold can be sold on the steam marketplace.
[*] The community is exceptionally nice, and there is an in game system that rewards respectful players. I've seen developers and community moderators online quite often in the general chat to talk with, and it shows a great commitment to their work. 
[*] Twitch is integrated directly into the game, and if you go to the menu via Escape you can link your twitch account directly to SODA. With it enabled you can view your twitch stream chat while in game, amongst several other useful features.
[*] A try hero mode can be played while waiting for your match Queue to pop. It allows you to warm up with a hero you'd like to play, or just mess around with various tactics versus an AI. It's a useful tool and a good way to pass the time! 

CONS:
[*] There are currently 20 heroes. This is something that can be expanded with updates as more characters rollout, but it is a relatively slim selection compared to what MOST MOBA players are used to. 
[*]There are currently Frame hitches that will happen during games. Developers are working on a patch to fix these problems, but as of right now there are many people suffering from frame rate issues. 
[*] The inventory system in your profile can at times feel harder to navigate. Especially at later levels as the icons are quite large, and by the time you hit level 10 or so you will have a lot of various materials. [/list]

[b]In Conclusion:[/b]
Sins of a Dark Age is a very well constructed MOBA that combines a lot of liked elements from the MOBA genre, and provides an effective way to come back with the use of team work. Especially when quest objectives and their respective rewards can really change up your plan in the game. E.G. If you complete the quest to gain the tower disable ability it is a smart time to push, whereas if you get the item to slow enemies it would indicate a heavy usage on ganks and team fights to be successful. 

The game offers a lot of fantastic player options, user interface improvements, and gameplay that rewards teamwork without making it always needed. You can still solo Queue and do great with a public team. Especially when your teammates all know to help with objectives, but it will reward teams for being well coordinated and communicating well. 

All of this with the price tag of : [b]FREE[/b] means that I can easily recommend this to ANY MOBA player or people looking for an introduction into the genre. It encompasses MOBA aspects expected by veterans of the genre, and it can successfully introduce new players to the genre. | Oyun dota 2  gibi, biraz oyuncu sıkıntısı var, skiller falan baya güzel genel anlamda oyun idare eder... Yeni olduğundan biraz karakterlerin ve itemlerin oturması lazım, tek başınıza oynadığınızda 20 dk da oyun bitiyor. Betadan çıktığında daha iyi olmacağını umuyorum...
 | Im one of those, who enjoy a lot of different MOBAs.

This one is amazing for what it does! The REAL Free 2 Play model they have adopted here is outstanding! Heck you can even get the skins for free! Im just hoping that they will be able to sustain the business with giving you so much stuff for nothing!

The stuff that you could compare to League of Legends rune system, is instead much more RPG themed, with items and such, but in theory it does the same stuff. But it feels a lot different.

The 5v5 mode which looks a lot like the ones your used to in other MOBAs, is A LOT different because of having objectives in the form of random quests that happens every now and then, which rewards the team that finishes it. It many times becomes a battle and balance between the teams on who wants it the most. Which puts a lot of tactical depth to the gameplay that feels very unique and is what makes this game stand out the most!

The 2v2 is really fun, fast and actionpacked. I have never enjoyed single lane gameplay before, but in this game it is awesome fun! Try it out, specially with a buddy, or heck with 3 other buddys you can do custom 2v2 and have a blast!

This is also the first ever game I seen that SPONSORS anyone who streams the game! LIKE REALLY! From in game you can giveaway in game chests to your viewers as long as they have signed in to their twitch account from the game menu. And since its F2P that is so easy for them to do. In return they can upvote your stream from inside the game, through witch you as the streamer gets rewarded with chests and items. This thing is something every game dev should look at and think about. This is how you support the twitch community on a passive way where everyone benefits! Best initiative I have seen from a developer when it comes to supporting streamers.

Give this game a go! Its amazingly well and totally worth! This deserves a lot more spotlight and should be one up there competing with the other MOBAs imo! | Ealry Access review: 

Positives: The community is great! The devs and mods are awesome and frequently play! The gameplay is unique, and the graphics/artwork is continually improving with each update. The selection of heroes is becoming more diverse. The questing system is awesome and adds ways for the game to change quickly. The devs always listen to your suggestions and issues and do their best to implement what they can. The item system and RPG element is well balanced and only getting better. The new jungling system is a huge improvement and the new Duel modes and vs AI modes add more ways to play when not many people are on. It will be free-to-play soon, and is NOT a pay-to-win game.(thank god, or jeebus, or flying spaghetti monster or whoever you praise)

Negatives: The population is low except during peak hours. Seems to be optimization issues with older systems.(common for early access games) 

This is the first online game I've enjoyed in many many years. | Sins of a dark age is now my #1 favorite moba. I have spent 130 hours in it so far and can tell you what I have observed so far while playing it.

* The game has a highly active developer team who will help you and are on almost every day quite often. They also even play!

* Skills in the game are very fluid and can also be hotkeyd to whatever key binding you want them on.

* They have a market system where you can trade skin recipes and weapons/armor/trinkets and the components to craft them.

* When playing against high levels as a lower level they turn off their bonus stats and items to balance them to your level so say you had 1 stat point they also would only have 1.

* In game party system where you can team up with 3 other people and play a game with.

* Custom games; This is where you can practice if you dont feel like you are ready to play other players yet or are new to mobas. You can also use them for fun skirmishes between friends or set up a tournament for prizes on the forums and host it in custom.

*Sins Of A Dark Age also has a unique quest system which will give you various buffs and abilities as well as special lane minions and EVEN GOLD!!! Some of the buffs include crippling poison that does damage, a hawk you can use to be a vision ward for a short duration and a team buff that gives more damage to teamates. You can also get a gryphon to push a lane A GRYPHON!!!! You can also slay a DRAGON!! 

* One thing you should know before purchasing this game is that there is a very low playerbase as it is in alpha right now so que times will be long during certian times of days and then 5-10 min other days.

I will be streaming this game at     http://www.twitch.tv/baal2023     if you want to catch a glimpse at the gameplay and mechanics and I look forward to seeing you in game!"

Go down (or up) on randomly generated dungeons, gather items and use them to deal with creatures. It's kind of casual until the first ending, which is the point I'm telling everyone to play. After that you get some bonus levels which are... More directed towards the OG Thief veterans.

如果说 POE2 将来可能成为最好的 ARPG，恐怖黎明现在就是最好的 ARPG。ARPG 新手可以无脑入，DLC 也全买，有 DLC 才是完整游戏。而对于 ARPG 老兵，恐怖黎明有什么特别的？

它从头到尾都尊重你的时间。

现在的赛季制 ARPG 游戏，重心都放在了终局，而低级的剧情阶段不过是走过场，好像是为了尝到终局的甜而必须吃的苦（POE2 有改进但还不够）。恐怖黎明不是。从游戏的最开始，ARPG 的两样核心，build 和 farm 就在成型了。

Build 是寻找最优解，是谜题和选择，恐怖黎明更快更多地把谜题摆在玩家面前：
- 技能点升一级不是给 1 点而是 3 点
- 镶嵌物从 5 级开始就很重要，而不像其他游戏因为需要打孔是后期内容，这里不需要打孔
- 星座相当于 POE 中的被动技能树，但有意义的大点更靠前，这些会赋予主动技能触发特效，是 Build 的基石，而在很前期就能体验到
- 加技能等级的装备和套装在前期就开始掉落，可以完全按照得到的装备来进行开荒 Build

Farm 赋予了玩家游玩的意义，POE2 和 D4 前期不会有任何 Farm，因为没有意义，前期装备非常弱，很快就要被替换。这也是这些游戏前期与后期游玩体验的割裂的原因之一，而恐怖黎明通过很多巧妙而统一的设计，让前期的 Farm 更有意义：
- 精妙的数值设计，一件 50 级的装备和终局的装备，在面板上看是两倍的数值而不是十倍或百倍，开荒期的装备保质期更长
- 一些怪物有特定掉落，这些掉落非常适合于某些 Build，甚至在终局是最好的装备
- 装备槽位多，总共 14 个，比起 D4 这些多出了护肩和勋章等部位，这意味着掉落提升角色的可能性更大
- 慷慨的掉率，独特的史诗装备和传奇装备相当于其他游戏的暗金和套装，掉得更早更多，DLC 更是提供了新的掉落途径
- 势力声望系统，Farm 至少会推进声望，而声望奖励非常优越，一方面可以直接买很好的开荒装备，另一方面终局总是需要买声望给的增辐，所以前期的 Farm 也为终局做了准备

恐怖黎明还有太多优秀之处，如手工设计的地图，塞满了奖励驱动，或是 Build 的丰富性，或是数值上的精妙，也不需要一一提及，能做好前期的 Build 和 Farm 就值得每一个 ARPG 老兵的时间。
这也不是说恐怖黎明在终局的 Build 和 Farm 就不出彩，只是我刚通第一个难度全 DLC，还没打到终局，没什么可说的。
总之推荐给每一个人，这游戏里每一秒都是值得的，在 ARPG 里很少见。 | Great ARPG with the most free choice in skill tree combinations I have seen, combine trees and you can build pretty much whatever you want. Lots of unique items to specialise things even further. No seasonal slop, no ""always online"" garbage. There is so much build potential I keep coming back again and again. There's even secret stuff for you to find.

My only gripe is after playing so many hours, I wish I had a little more bank space to store things.

才发现玩了这么久居然没给评价

还有这新dlc2023年就有消息了  2025年了 居然还没玩上 | Falo com convicção: este é o melhor ARPG isométrico da atualidade - que não está na categoria de ""jogo como serviço"" — caso contrário, Path of Exile 1 e 2 seriam ótimos concorrentes . Nem mesmo a Blizzard conseguiu entregar um ARPG à altura desde os clássicos Diablo 1 e 2. Dentre os vários pontos de destaque de Grim Dawn, eu consigo citar os seguintes:
- O sistema de combinação de classes é bem diferente, você tem ali (considerando as DLC's) 9 classes base, e podendo realizar a combinação com mais uma classe, você tem a possibilidade de criar até 44 classes;
- Habilidades e poderes trazem peso e fluidez ao combate, fazendo com que cada encontro seja satisfatório.
- A atmosfera sombria, aliada a uma narrativa rica e bem construída, me manteve engajado e curioso sobre o desfecho da história.
- Conteúdo de Endgame: Repleto de desafios, dungeons, facções e atividades para explorar, garantindo horas de diversão mesmo após finalizar a campanha principal.
- Suporte a Mods: A possibilidade de mods amplia ainda mais a rejogabilidade, permitindo aos fãs personalizar e expandir o jogo ao infinito.
- A trilha sonora ambiente é excelente e contribui muito para a atmosfera sombria do jogo, lembrando o estilo marcante de Diablo 2. 
- Já a temática se destaca por fugir do convencional entre os ARPGs, que geralmente exploram criaturas mitológicas, demônios e fantasia medieval. Grim Dawn aposta em uma ambientação inspirada na era vitoriana, com inimigos interdimensionais devastando a humanidade — é uma premissa inusitada, mas que traz uma originalidade bem-vinda. 

Não posso deixar de elogiar o cuidado da Crate Entertainment com este jogo: sem monetização abusiva, passes ou qualquer outra prática predatória, e ainda assim eles continuam atualizando o título mesmo após 8 anos de seu lançamento.

Recomendo. | Grim Dawn, desarrollado por Crate Entertainment, es un ARPG lanzado en 2016 que bebe directamente de Diablo 2 y Titan Quest. Nos mete en un mundo oscuro y apocalíptico donde la humanidad está al borde de la extinción tras un conflicto entre seres de otra dimensión. Como buen RPG de acción, nuestra tarea será saquear, mejorar habilidades y enfrentarnos a hordas de enemigos mientras descubrimos los secretos del mundo de Cairn.

Con años de actualizaciones y expansiones, Grim Dawn ha evolucionado bastante. Pero, ¿sigue siendo una alternativa real a Diablo en 2025?

✅ Lo bueno: Un ARPG profundo y adictivo
✔ Sistema de clases flexible y profundo – No eliges una clase única, sino dos, permitiendo combinaciones brutales como un soldado nigromante o un chamán pistolero. La personalización es una de sus mayores fortalezas.

✔ Loot satisfactorio y progresión bien medida – Aquí el farmeo tiene sentido. Siempre hay mejores armas y equipo, pero el equilibrio está bien llevado para que cada mejora se sienta significativa.

✔ Mundo oscuro y bien construido – No es solo un mapa por el que avanzas matando enemigos; hay historia, lore y NPCs con misiones bien diseñadas. No es un simple mata-mata sin alma.

✔ Endgame sólido – Modo New Game+, facciones, mazmorras roguelike y un montón de contenido adicional que extiende la vida útil del juego más allá de la historia principal.

✔ Expansiones que realmente valen la pena – Ashes of Malmouth y Forgotten Gods no son simples añadidos, sino mejoras sustanciales con nuevas clases, mapas y sistemas de juego.

✔ No requiere conexión online – Puedes jugar solo o en cooperativo sin necesidad de estar atado a servidores, algo que cada vez se agradece más.

❌ Lo malo: No es para todo el mundo
❌ Gráficos algo anticuados – No es feo, pero tampoco esperes efectos visuales espectaculares. Tiene su encanto, pero comparado con otros ARPG modernos, se nota la edad del motor gráfico.

❌ Combate con menos impacto que en Diablo – Si vienes de Diablo 3 o Path of Exile, notarás que el combate se siente un poco más ""blando"", con menos feedback visual y sonoro al golpear enemigos.

❌ Interface y QoL mejorables – La UI es algo arcaica y el inventario puede volverse un caos. Se echan en falta mejoras de calidad de vida en la gestión del loot.

❌ Dificultad mal balanceada en algunos tramos – Puede ser un paseo en los primeros niveles y luego pegar un pico de dificultad inesperado si no has preparado bien tu build.

🎭 Conclusión: Un ARPG para los que buscan profundidad
Si te gusta la personalización extrema, el farmeo bien medido y un mundo con historia, Grim Dawn es una joya. No es tan explosivo como Diablo 3, ni tan masivo como Path of Exile, pero tiene una identidad propia y una comunidad fiel que lo mantiene vivo.

🔹 ¿Lo recomiendo? Sí, especialmente si buscas un ARPG clásico con muchas posibilidades de personalización.
🔸 ¿Es mejor que Diablo? Depende de lo que busques. Si te gusta la profundidad y la libertad en las builds, puede que sí. Si prefieres un combate más dinámico y espectacular, no tanto.

Quicker game play than the full Digital Edition
Useful for learning the rules and character nuances in Talisman: Digital Edition



[u]Cons[/u]:

Can't save the game. They definitely need to fix this. (Seriously, Nomad, what [b]are[/b] you thinking here?)
Game play can get extremely redundant with only one character on the board.




[u]Verdict[/u]:

Worth buying when it goes on sale, [u]if[/u]:

* You already know you really want it
* The Digital Edition confuses you and you want to practice the nuances of the game
* You're a compulsive collector like me
* You're not going to bother with the Digital Edition anyway

If none of those apply, then I'd say don't bother. | Although, I bought two versions of Talisman (Prologue and Digital Edition), I started with this. Yes, I got a good experience, playing and learning different characters, their advantages. This helps me to know the game, its rules. But after some games, this solo adventure starts to bother me. Quests quite frankly aren't interesting. Often you need to get to some place or monster, and you roll dice one by one until you get exactly you need (Sometimes I spent more than 20-25 turns just only to be on the same space as my quest's task). I don't persuade to buy Talisman, but don't waste money, buy original Talisman: Digital Edition, where you get better experience, fun and enjoyment playing with friends or bots. There you will not only roll dices, but also think about your next steps. | Definitely a 'Prologue' (introduction) to the Talisman Digital Edition. Consider this to be a tutorial to the extreme, enough to be able to sell it seperately.

I consider it more of an occasional distraction, probably not one of those games that you feel like playing for hours on end...but one of those that you 'pull off of the shelf' here and there.

After playing Talisman Digital Edition, I will say that I did miss the quests. Ultimately, it could be cool to blend the two and introduce individual quests into the Digital Edition.

It seems that, at the least, Prologue will either be a quick distraction, or it will be one of those that you will enjoy here and there. (Obviously there is the possibility that it may just 'click' and it is played to completion).

In other words, for the price ... not too bad.  I enjoyed it so far, but for me it is here and there.  It would seem hard to go wrong if you can get it in a bundle or, as currently under a couple bucks. (I'm buying a couple extra as gifts ... can't go too wrong for that price and maybe they will go for the Digital Edition and we can do multiplayer...) | First let me say i wasnt aware of talisman till a few days ago and i have to be completely honest.
This is a must buy. im loving ever minute, and yes i too read all the mixed reviews and in part i agree.

but heres my way to decide if talismans for you.

1. buy the multi player version first (at writing this review it was on sale £1.67).full price around £5.

2. ( watch a few youtube vids on the game, & get a feel for the rules etc)

3. if you feel that this is your sort of game, then purchase the prologue.

This is in main a tutorial , dont worry to much about counting moves, just enjoy the ride that is talismam.
There are more than 50 quests, and the pros of this are you will get to really understand about how to build your chosen characters , get a taste of what possible rewards and pitfalls await you within the adventure card deck,which must be turned after every move and finally which squares of the board not to go to.

This is why its a must buy for anyone thats new to talisman.

(at time of review it was not on sale ) .

so at this point weve spent less than the price of a costa coffee & muffin (£7)

im old skool and this feels like your playing a adventure story novel, the dice will make or break you.
but im enjoying every minute playing and as i select every adventure card or spell card you will be like a kid opening a present. 

for the price you get a lot of fun for your bucks.
you dont have to dig deep and buy all the expansions right away.

theres plenty here to keep you going, for now.

i give prologue  a beast slaying, spell casting  8/10

The best way to find your gaming legs , which will only add to you enjoying the multiplayer game even more.





 | Il faut prendre ce jeu pour ce qu'il est : une initiation au ""monde"" de Talisman, le jeu de plateau. Et il faut avouer que la réalisation graphique/rendu est très satisfaisante à quelques détails près.

C'est un jeu où le hasard a une place importante, c'est d'ailleurs ce qui en fait en partie son charme. On pourrai comparer au jeu de l'Oie pour les déplacements (on est obligé de se déplacer du nombre demandé), les mécaniques ensuite font beaucoup penser à celles des jeux de rôles d'univers Médiéval Fantastique. 

J'ai trouvé celà plaisant mais pas exeptionnel (en Solo). Cette version permet de découvrir le système et après avoir testé les quêtes de quelques personnages on cherchera sans aucun doute autre chose. L'intéret de ce jeu est plus dans le multijoueur.

La version Solo qu'est Talisman : Prologue, m'a donné envie de m'intéresser au ""vrai"" jeu de plateau. Avec mes enfants, et leurs amis, ce serai sans doute un bon compromis face aux autres jeux de société plus classiques."

It sucks because the steam release is half baked and seems like it was published as a draft by a bunch of interns. There is no save functionality. The UI is unintuitive and prone to causing serious errors or missed opportunities. What's really bad is with seemingly just a few more hours of work and addressing feedback this could be a fine adaptation. Instead we have hot garbage that demonstrates the continued disregard of the developers with every day this awful game isn't patched. | I've had this game for a few years now and I have to say this is a fantastic version of the board game.  The art is great, the music is awesome and I love all the expansions and, with Nomad games making them playable for free at various times, you can try them before you buy!  If you love the board game (and I do) you won't be disappointed with this version | I really wanted to like this game, even if it is based on a board game that is really old. The early aspects I found quite enjoyable, moving around the board, facing encounters, and getting stronger. Two aspects of this game just killed it for me: PVP and the end game. Essentially, I see no real reason to do anything but a strength character. Craft lets you get around a little easier at times, but strength can just steamroll everything, and if a caster has to PVP a strength character, they lose. The end game is nothing but luck. I spent nine rounds on the crown, and only twice did the command spell work. By then, two other strength players had reached me, and even with decent strength, it couldn't compete with those who had strength in double digits. It just killed the whole experience for me, as I had no method to win. Even the others agreed how broken it was. Don't bother with this one. | до выхода нового талисмана игруля была имбищем. боты, которые тебя постоянно ебут и срут заклинаниями, рандом (который часто давал говнище реальным игрокам и балдеж ботам) тоже прикольный. можно кастомить каждую катку по-разному.... но.. после обновы НЕ ТОЛЬКО У МЕНЯ перестал работать онлайн. в попытке просто зайти в лобби выкидывает других игроков, в том числе и хозяина лобби, в итоге хорошо работает соло режим. я очень расстроена, новую часть покупать не хочу, а работать нормально перестало как раз с ее выходом (совсем не подозрительно) | Excelente juego, jugué 76 horas y aun no terminé la primera partida"

It is very beautifully executed, but just a bit outdated now. | This game is very tricky and easy to understand, but VERY hard to master. (I remember playing it either as an older teen or within my earlier young adult years.)

To die for? Not really. It also has some weir,d un-neccesary glitches that need bugfix patches.

But is it worth a try when discounted?

76561197999259031,219830,King Arthur's Gold,5.6,"Action, Free To Play, Indie",2,"The game is legitimately incredible.

The player base sucks. | I love this game. King Arthur's Gold is a masterclass of emergent mechanics and one of the few games which brings that to PvP. The defenses you build will never totally prevent an enemy from making progress, but they can slow them down long enough for you to deal with them. It's a game of plays and counter-plays and changing your tactics on the fly to meet the situation. There's always some strange item or mechanic you can pull out to keep the fight interesting. This might not be for everyone, but if you enjoy thinking sideways and rat tactics this is your game.

The main issue with the game is the lack of active servers and the community on them. As the game has an extremely high skill ceiling, most people still playing will absolutely clown on new people to the extent the game isn't fun. You will likely need to provide your own friends and host your own server (which only requires editing a config file and port forwarding).

Most of my time in the game has been with low population private games with friends. If you're going to do that, manually balancing the teams in terms of both players and skill is going to be essential as with few people the game requires you to know what you're doing and adapt quickly to situations as they come up.

There are a ton of game modes built in and a lot of modded servers. If you're looking to host a modded server, the modding community is unfortunately very hostile, but as mods are stored locally you can copy them as you see fit. Be warned, a lot of modders attempt to put traps in their mods to make them not work right unless they're the ones hosting them. The game itself is very modding-friendly. Even the base game is built on scripts.

The negatives I present here are mostly to try and help people find the fun. It's a lot easier to describe the problems with the game than to give a detailed account of how the game works and what it does well, as there's just so much going on here. Especially for a free game you can try yourself. I paid for this game before it went free to play and haven't regretted it. There's nothing else like it out there. | Long time classic, much recommend"
76561197999259031,262060,Darkest Dungeon®,28.65,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",21,"[h2]Darkest Dungeon — симулятор нервного срыва с готической эстетикой 😈[/h2]
Если вам кажется, что жизнь — это боль, просто попробуйте Darkest Dungeon. Эта игра покажет, что боль бывает разной: острая, как критический удар босса, тягучая, как бесконечный гринд, и горькая, как осознание, что твоя лучшая команда сошла с ума в первом же походе. 🎭

[h2]Визуал, ощущение и звук — атмосферно как похоронный марш 🎻⚰️[/h2]
Готическая рисовка, гипнотический саундтрек и диктор, чей голос мог бы зачитывать эпитафию, создают невероятную атмосферу. Смотреть на игру приятно, слушать — тоже, но вот играть… Это уже отдельный вопрос.
[b]Геймплей — „ещё один заход, и спать“ (ложь!) [/b]🔄😵

[h2]Игра — бесконечный цикл страданий:[/h2]
❗️Собрал героев (учёл их страхи, фобии и дурные привычки).
❗️Снарядил их (понял, что денег мало, продал ненужные тринкеты, теперь их не хватает на лечение).
❗️Отправил в поход (один герой впал в безумие, второй едва пережил два смертельных удара, третий просто умер).
❗️Вернулся в город (игровой зал ограблен, лечиться негде, нервный тик у игрока усиливается).
❗️Повторил всё снова (а мог бы заняться чем-то полезным, но нет).

[h2]„Рандом“ и баланс — где правда? 🎲[/h2]
Одни говорят: «всё зависит от удачи», другие — «опытный игрок контролирует хаос». Истина где-то посередине. Когда ты промазал, враг уклонился, а потом вмазал тебе критом — это „игровая механика“. Когда ты сделал то же самое — „баланс“.

[h2]Затягивает? Да. Бесит? О, да! 💀[/h2]
[b]Игра — наркотик:[/b] сложный, затягивающий, временами несправедливый, но невероятно проработанный. Кто-то бросает её на середине из-за монотонности, кто-то зачищает карту до последнего босса, а кто-то сидит уже 50 часов и не может остановиться.

[b]Вывод:[/b] если у вас крепкие нервы и много свободного времени — вперёд, в мрак. Но если вам дорога ваша психика… ну, вас предупреждали. 😈🎮 | 新手上手不难，甚至比月计还简单一些，风格也熟悉，各位主管，司书，管理员必入 | É de fato um jogo intrigante. Você passa um bom tempo jogando como se ele fosse um jogo qualquer, quando na verdade o rumo que se deve ter é completamente diferente. Darkest Dungeon é uma das minhas experiências mais difíceis que eu tive nos últimos anos com jogos. A jogabilidade é extremamente punitiva, nociva caso não saiba o que está fazendo. Um dos núcleos do jogo, é o dinheiro. É necessário entrar nas missões (dungeons), se importar com fazer dinheiro, sua sobrevivência e ainda completar o seu objetivo. Conciliar todos esses fatores, transforma a experiência em um ciclo maçante de fazer dinheiro e upar personagens para o final do jogo. Penso que essa ferramenta utilizada para ser a ponte principal do Darkest Dungeon, pode ser bem mal vista para quem pensa em zerar o jogo.

Mas, além de tudo, gostaria de enaltecer a arte característica e virtuosa, que transmite perfeitamente a atmosfera obscura das dungeons, da sofrência e do medo. A direção artística voltada ao tema ""Lovecrafteana"", é muito bem feito, principalmente no que se diz progressão visual. Os ambientes se tornando mais medonhas cada vez que você vai progredindo para o final do jogo, a mudança de cores voltadas ao cosmo e carnificina ou até mesmo as músicas que passam de um violino arranhado e agitado para algo mais ""contemplador""

Por fim, vai minha dica:
- Se você quiser uma experiência menos massiva, jogue na dificuldade Radiante
- Caso queira sofrer um pouco mais, tendo que repetir missões para ficar mais forte, jogue na Mais Escura
- E se você for um mutante, jogue na mais difícil mesmo, é uma experiência semelhante a estar em um quarto branco com camisa de força no corpo | This is a game I played on an off for years, and both loved it and grew frustrated by it as I played.  This last year I decided it was time to beat the game finally, so I dedicated a bit more of my gaming time to it, and feel I can give some fairly informed thoughts on the game.  

Darkest Dungeon has a fun party management system that is well designed and the heart and soul of the game.  Do you select your ranged skills for your Highwayman so he can be in position 3?  Or do you take his pos 1/2 skills and play more of a high risk high reward style of play up front?  Do you put your jester in the back making him a buffing character?  Or do you put him further forward so you can apply bleed and be more of a DPS character?  It allows you to make a lot of different parties in different ways, and as you play you learn what combo's works best for each situation, and which ones you prefer to play.  

The enemies also have positions that work differently for each enemy type, and some of your characters will let you manipulate the positions of your enemies to mess them up or put them in a position for one of your other characters to pummel them into the dirt.   So overall the game play is EXCELLENT.

Where I had my struggles with the game was losing characters.  When I first started playing the game it really hurt to lose that Leper that I had been using effectively for so many dives into the dungeon.  I eventually learned that dying is an important aspect of the game, and if you upgrade your stagecoach you will be just fine.  The death of the characters also adds weight to your decisions in the game.  If you decide to get too crazy with a party/skill composition there is a very real chance you are going to lose some of your characters.  So if you decide to play Darkest dungeon just accept right off the bat that death is part of the grim dark theme of the game.

The other aspect of the game that people may not like is the tone and atmosphere of the game.  It is a grim dark themed horror game.  Horror is not really my jam to be honest, but the game play and how the theme is executed, and the great narration of the game drew me in despite my lack of interest in the horror genre.  

Overall the game play is excellent, and the setting, style and art of the game is unique and intriguing.  I would highly recommend this to people looking for a great rogue like dungeon crawler that stands out in an over crowded market. | Ужасный дизбаланс, прокачиваешь одного перса по максимуму, все деньги сливаешь на то чтобы вылечить его грёбаный сифилис, отправить его в бар снять стресс, прокачать ему его боевой навык, а он умирает на очередной вылазке просто из-за того что кто-то из авантюристов сошёл с ума и добил твой танк который был на лолхп потому что такая же обезумевшая весталка отказалась его лечить.

　戦闘は武器の当たり判定が曖昧でどこに当たったのやら感覚が掴めず、武器弾薬の数が限られているうえに特定の進行状況に達すると敵が露骨に無限湧きする迷惑仕様。L4Dのような撃ちまくり系のバランスではないにも関わらず、MAPやモードによってはゾンビがL4Dのように大群となって押しよせてくる。数が多いのもそうだが、倒した先から追加でおかわりが登場する有り様で、湧くスピードが不自然に早過ぎる。当然のことながら、プレイヤーの数に合わせて敵の数や難易度を調整するような神経をこのゲームは持ち合わせていない。
　しかもゾンビどもは全力疾走しながらも足音を立てずいつの間にか隣に立ってぶん殴って来るというニンジャぶりを発揮してくるので（本作はサウンドデザインがまったく良くない）、難しいとかいうより「ああ、開発者はプレイヤーを殺すことしか考えてないんだな」と理不尽を覚える、購入とプレイを後悔する疲労がじんわりと額に広がる瞬間である。
　良い点はといえばマイナーな火器が多数登場するところ、SIG SPやマニューリンなどは他のゲームで滅多に見ることはないためつい使ってしまう。ただ先述のように銃弾のヒット感がなく手ごたえがない、おまけに命中精度が異様に低く、アサルトライフルなどは赤ん坊の小便のように弾が散らばり10m先の標的さえまともに射抜けない。さらに密着するとこちらの攻撃が当たらず敵から一方的に殴られるという駄目ゲーあるあるな残念仕様である。総じて戦闘はまったく面白くない。
　率直に言って、このゲームを友達とプレイしたいとは思わない。そんなことをしたら俺は嫌われ者になってしまうよ。 | O jogo se encontra com vários bugs, quando jogado co-op só piora.

I figured out that the NPCs would not rebuild the Mercinary Posts once they were destroyed so I fucused on that heavily in the early game. Still it seemed kind of impossible since there would be more and more tough enemys with more Money Advantage for them...

実は今でも起動して運が良ければ遊べる。
……殆どの場合、「サーバーが一時的にオフライン」と表示され起動画面から終了せざるを得ないが。
本当に運が良ければメインゲームが起動し、Age of Raceingの舞台の説明が入ったOPムービーが流れ、
ロビー画面にアクセスできる。

他のプレイヤーはもう居ない。過去、栄光を手に入れてそのまま入っていたランカー達も居ない。
一人しかいないけどとりあえずHotLapとかDriverSchoolくらいは遊べる…はず。
色々見まわってHopLapして一周したら「サーバー切断」との事。
もしやと思いつつ再起動したらまたサーバーがオフラインになってた。

RaceCraftも開発が中止され、このゲームも辛うじて遊べるってだけ。
多分もう開発チームも解散してしまったのだろう。

……また遊びたい、と思うのは贅沢だろうか。
どうにかしてオフライン対応買い切り版出してもらえないものか……。"

Has Raven so I can't complain | Mortal Kombat but with DC characters, however this game is excellent. I remember playing it as a young stupid kid on the Xbox 360, and replaying it feels so nice. The graphics has held up as well imo, and everything else is great. The characters, the storyline, the fighting and such is easy to grasp and learn. I recommend playing with a controller then PC but up to you of course! I also got Injustice 2 and it's also awesome, I prefer this one I think but I like that the 2nd one added more characters, wish they had Batgirl, Zatanna, and Killer Frost though. Sucks they don't, but anyway I recommend this yet again, it's nicely done. And I hate the joker design from Injustice 2 lol, he's an edge lord now. it's terrible, this design is much much better LMAO | its a really fun game until you see a deathstroke player who keeps spamming sword flip and quick fire and starts teabagging to show this game's netcode is terrible or maybe you just suck at this game for me its both of them | É legal ver os heróis lutando.

但小鬼讨厌不代表作品不行，对于一个超英主题的格斗游戏，众多场景互动使玩家很有dc世界沉浸感，也不会像街头格斗那样出戏，当然，战力差距导致出戏对于格斗游戏那肯定是不可避免的
脸模都比较一般，但毕竟是老游戏了，也不必苛责，不过演出效果也确实不如隔壁亲儿子mk
剧情选择了带来一个模板正联和不义宇宙区分开，我觉得这是真的很棒的设计，能同时照顾到不同侧的粉丝，是比二代的剧情设计强的点"

Right up there or better than Rome Total War, Age of Empires, Age of Mythology.  9.5/10. I thoroughly enjoyed AOW2 as well growing up with my dad and brother. And for AOW3 thank goodness it had a bit of a story mode too. Not that I needed an expansive one, but it really helped me learn the nuances of the game (which is why I just couldn't get into AOW4 due to their LACK of any story mode). 

The only area I felt was missing was what I thought were upcoming DLC's (Shadow Realms, Archons and more) but they never came.

76561197999259031,259060,Dominions 4: Thrones of Ascension,44.03333333333333,"Indie, Strategy",0,"Just way too complicated for me - this game has gathered dust in my library for years because every time I've tried to play it I've just landed up scratching my head trying to understand what is going on - even a tutorial video on YouTube took like an hour just to get past some of the starting options, before even really getting into any game play.

Not helped by the fact that there doesn't seem to be a proper inbuilt tutorial (well there is in theory, but it directs me towards reading the manual and there is no on-screen help or tips that I can see). I like inbuilt tutorials because surely the people who developed the game should be best placed to tell us about all the mechanics and what is important, and if they don't see making the game comprehensible as being important then I'm kinda wondering why.

Within the game I just feel like there is too much stuff - do you want your pretender to be a dragon or a tree, what types of unit (of the many many types on offer) do you want to build, keeping in mind that they all have quite complicated stats and features, and it's not clear to me at all where I get things like research from etc - like I just don't understand at all the decisions I'm supposed to be making and I assume the only way to properly understand is to spend many many hours on Youtube tutorials and playing the game through repeatedly. I think that one thing which I feel makes it harder as a beginner is that many of these decisions feel quite drastic - i.e. having a large potential impact - it's not like choosing a civ which will be slightly better at tech, or slightly better with military, some of these feel like very fundamental and major choices and I don't really understand them or their potential impact later in the game at all.

I appreciate some people will read this and think I'm just lazy for not putting in more time to understand it properly but the simple reality is that I don't have the time or energy to understand something this complicated where the developers haven't really (in my view) made a bit more effort to ease me into it, with a proper tutorial and maybe a more user-friendly interface / hints, and some efforts to help me understand what the realistic impact of different decisions might be. I've played plenty of strategy games with various levels of complexity but for me this is complicated past the point where I feel like I will enjoy overall spending the time required to understand it. I have lot of other games in my library which I've played more (many of them cheaper than this one) because they are fairly easy to get into and have a good tutorial to get started, and I have a job where I'm expected to explain what I've done to customers rather than just sending them something overcomplicated and expecting them to work for hours to figure it out. So I just don't really see a good argument as to why this game couldn't be a bit more user friendly.

p.s. I am not whingeing about the graphics here, I would still pick up Civ 2 and play it very happily if I had a copy right now I just think this game is too complicated for me to get into and the interface / lack of a proper tutorial doesn't help. | I simply don't get it. You'll be doing fine keeping up constantly against a computer opponent then BAM, they drop 860 troops. I finally had one going fine and had half the board secure and steadily advancing then BAM, I stormed a castle after 6 rounds of siege and my entire board was wiped out. My God was secure and all the way in the back portion of the map so not in anyway vulnerable. Just YOU LOSE! The enemy didn't have even 100 troops near my location I was attacking and I had close to 1000. Makes no sense but won't ever involve any time in this game again. 

It's an interesting game but just as soon as you are getting ahead the computer opponents 

Lucky I got this game for around $5 but I would not suggest even paying that whenever they run a special. | Thought about it and wish I could recommend this game but it's literally micro-management hell. Was thinking about how many campaigns I started and realized I never really completed any of them. The gameplay loop isn't fun, it's more tedious than anything. Playing around with all the units and all the different pretender gods is really fun but doesn't make up for the gameplay. | Go play Dominions 6 if you can afford it. | UI is like total nonsense ...

it was called finished and had a few expansions
then all of a sudden the game was handed off to another team
they turned it more diablo like with a mana system among other things
now today looking at it seems they removed the old expansions, even from owners dlc lists?
its changed so much from what people paid for in the past
when it was considered and called finished
its honestly not the same game anymore......
games should not go from finished to vastly changed
if they wanted to do that they should have made a second game dont vastly change what people paid for

there was three early collector edition expansions or regular editions
they are now removed from everyones accounts so any extras from collectors editions are most likely gone
supported and lost your dlc and most likely any items that came with collectors

another thing was old days if recall did not require a login to play the game
so it was shifted to online

フレンドと2人～3人でプレイ。

なお日本語対応表記が付いているものの、オフライン版しか対応していないので要注意。
2023年10月の大型アプデで実質作り直されている為、どのみち現状は日本語非対応となっています。

DLC含め20クラス以上を収録。
WASD操作含めどのクラスもアクション性が高く、死んだら全ロストというひりつきとインフレしていくビルドが面白かったです。
個人的にレベルアップによるスキル派生と様々な装備を組み合わせたビルド作りは楽しく、ローグライクとは思えないほど装備が大量ドロップする景色は最高でした。
しかし弾幕要素の強いボス戦は中々シビアで、小さなミスで全ロストするとレベル1まで戻ってしまう為、高レベル帯で気を抜いて死ぬと萎えてしまうのはもう少し救済措置が欲しかったかなと。

それでも大量の装備及びクラスによる無限の可能性とアクション性の高い戦闘は今も評価出来る部分なので、英語でも遊べる人は触ってみて下さい。

Game is actually fine, but it starts to be boring real quick, at least that was my experience. Maybe, it's because I'm coming from the first game in the series, but Dark Souls 2 doesn't feel like it has purpose. 

In the first game we had a narrative, a story I would say. And I saw a soul in Dark Souls 1. Here, I just don't see it. Exploring locations becomes boring and useless. There are some good ideas, but they often get drown by the enemy amount and enemy placement.  

I can't call this game unique in any sense, honestly. And it's definitely worse than the first one. 
But it's playable and you can have some fun here. So it's a good game. It's just not as good as it could be. | Наконец то я прошел игру с длс и даже нг+(но без длс) проходил игру на клава-мыше и вполне более-мение комфортно. Вообщем знакомство с игрой началось давным-давно настолько давно что я и не помню когда! возможно когда игра только вышла ,но помню что посмотрел обзор в ютубе где говорилось ""что игра боль и страдания"" вдохновился и скачал ""народную версию"" это конечно мой первый солслайк был!До дарк солса если брать игры с ""мечами и магией""я играл только во всякие обливионы, скайримы и прочее!Взял я конечно нищего так как не люблю когда стартуешь в экипировке! когда с нуля начинаешь то каждый ржавый клинок или рваные тряпки гораздо ценнее!!В обучении я набрел на пещеру с двумя то ли тролями то ли ограми(у них на лбу рог но в ютубе их называют в основном тролямя) вообщем я подумал что это боссы и они охраняли какуюто лодку!(я думал лодка меня приведет к сокровищам)поэтому решил сражаться! у меня не было никакого оружия (кинжал я по какой то причине не нашел) взял я руку в руку и пошел драться голыми руками и забил их! умер не меньше 50-ти скорее всего под сотню раз умирал но победил! Сел я в лодку и ничего!Сел снова и ничего я подумал что может для сетевой игры и ушел (как по мне эта гроб-лодка самое бесполезное что я видел в играх)Пришел я в Маджулу с крутейшим саундреком весь такой на понтах я ж забил огров руками!И тут меня забили свини!xD!Поняв что свиней лучше не трогать пошел в самое очевидное место это в башню хейда там стоял гигантский рыцарь я думал щас я ему наваляю я ж по пути нашел сломаный меч! я же тролей голыми руками забил!И рыцаря я еле бил а он меня с 3-4 ударов сносил!Вообщем рыцарь объяснил что мне пока рано сюда!Тогда я пошел то ли в ютуб то ли сам нашел путь в лес гигантов и вот я вижу зомбаков-пехотинец думаю ""во противники явно в моей весовой категории""влетаю в зомбака начинаю рубить его своим сломаным мечом и вот стамина моя заканчивается и зомбак дает мне свое комбо с 4-5 ударов я отпрыгиваю еле живой в голове в смысле?!?! я ж тут главный герой!я ж избранный! как так! какой то рядовой моб меня так снес!Я же в ""скайриме"" гору врагов нарубил!я же в ""моунт анд блейд"" целые армии соло разбивал!А тут простой зомбак меня почти убил!знатно меня так дарк солс попустил!xD Вообщем не помню сколько я еще играл в первый раз! но точно игру в первый раз игру не прошел! сгорел!

Железный Король просто смешной для ""ключевого"" боса слабак я в основном в лаву падал!лучше бы Демон с плавильни сделали бы обладателем великой души! Фрея тоже слабый босс конечно она сожрала великую душу но все же ключевой босс и такой слабый даже в первый раз я ее 1ой-3х попыток убил лучше бы Миту сделали ""великой""запретить выкачку яда с арены и был возможно самый сложный боссом в игре!я пробывал немного убивать ее в яде жесть!
вроде все ""притензиям"" Для меня это лучший солс в который я играл!1-й и 3-й я не играл по ранее описанным причинам!В элден рин играл в народную версию но не понравилось слишком открытые пустые локации, а добило отсутствие ценной награды за боссов например я дрался с каким то драконом в болоте умер раз 15 и вот я его убил и получил очень мало душ на 2-3 уровня прокачки хватило ,а вещь дали""или нашел за боссом""там щит какой то который хуже чем тот который я выбил с моба что разочаровало...Во 2-ром дарке а может и во всех 3-х если даже награда за босса не очень то после босса будет целая крутая локация где что нить точно найдешь хорошее!также играл в несколько ""аниме солсов"" которые тоже не понравились!Вторая для меня лучшая игра!Возможно любимая игра из всех!я ее прошел 3 раза 2 раза без длс и один раз полностью!Ни одну игру столько не перепроходил!И раз десять почти проходил... | 你tmlgb万代南梦宫你们是不是飘了，tm艾尔登法环和只狼火了，就觉得自己了不起了？老游戏你不打折力度更狠点，反而还涨价，你们是不是觉得自己更高人一等了，你们真应该s全家，祝你们早日挂墙上。 | Nunca entendi el hate a este juego, solo se aleja un poco de la formula original de los Dark souls modificando un poco las mecanicas, pero en cuanto a jugabilidad es entretenido y siempre tendras contenido por jugar, tendras bastantes horas de juego con este titulo, ahora, el platino por otro lado es otro tema, con el online muerto es un VERDADERO infierno farmear los pactos (al menos tire 30 hrs farmeando xD) Otro punto a favor son sus DLC's que tienen de jefes memorables hasta paisajes increibles con un buen lore.

It’s absolutely scandalous to encounter a game that doesn’t support 4K screens and doesn’t function at all on Linux. 

I’ve taken a screenshot, which I’ve uploaded directly to my website for you to see: [https://www.olivierpons.fr/download/creeper-world-3-2025-02-09-19h55m38s.png](https://www.olivierpons.fr/download/creeper-world-3-2025-02-09-19h55m38s.png). When you launch the game and move the mouse over the menu, the fonts are embarrassingly small—so much so that it’s almost ridiculous and reflects poorly on the developers. 

How is it possible in 2025 to release a game that doesn’t even start up correctly? As someone who has developed a Unity game myself, I’m in a strong position to critique this, as I know exactly what I’m talking about. Adapting to different screen resolutions is one of the most basic aspects of game development. This is simply unacceptable.

I might consider giving a positive review if the font issues are resolved and the game runs properly on Linux. 

The developers claim it’s Linux-compatible, but it’s clear they haven’t tested it thoroughly. The latest version doesn’t work at all on Linux, and I’ve even read on forums that to get it running correctly, you need to revert to a previous version. There’s an entire set of steps required to downgrade and make it functional. It’s baffling that they can label it as “compatible” when it clearly isn’t. This lack of testing on the platform is inexcusable.

While I’ve focused a lot on the Linux issue, the core problem, as shown in my screenshot, is the incredibly small fonts on 4K screens. This suggests one of two things: either they don’t test on 4K screens—which is inconceivable in 2025—or they simply can’t be bothered to optimize the display for high-resolution screens. Either way, it’s unacceptable. 

And to think this is called *Creeper World III*, implying it’s the third iteration of the game. I can’t even imagine what the previous versions must have been like! | Good Game.

I highly recommend checking out the steam workshop for this game if you ever feel like vanilla starts to get kinda stale. And while this is my most played game, I DO NOT RECOMMEND GETTING THIS GAME FULL PRICE. Frequently this game goes on sale for like 75% and the base game alone is not worth the price tag especially as a lot of features that most Stellaris players like messing with are behind DLCs so unless there's some part of the game that you're desperate to play with I'd get the base game and any interesting DLC while they're on sale. | So this is exactly the type of multiple month game time negative review that gets screen shot and memed on social media, but I'm sad to say I mean it in the most literal sense.  I have enjoyed much of my play time with Stellaris, but I emphatically don't recommend anyone purchase this game in it's current, maximum DLC form.
When this game launched, it was a refreshingly basic 4X. Most of the changes made in the early years all the way to the Nemesis expansion added meaningfully to the gameplay without making it overwhelming and complicated for new players.  Unfortunately recent patches and expansions have unfortunately been hats on hats, mostly adding complexity without adding fun.  I have enjoyed the ride for the most part, but like most Paradox games the continual addition of DLC eventually replaces the game you loved with something you barely recognize while draining your wallet. | [h1]Stellaris[/h1]

[h1]Описание:[/h1]
[i][b]Stellaris[/b] — это смесь грандиозной 4X-стратегии, ролевой игры и интерактивного романа, где вы сами пишете историю своего народа среди звёзд. Разработчики создали  эпическое повествование о взлётах и падениях цивилизации. От первых робких шагов в космосе до управления межгалактической империей — здесь есть место всему: дипломатии, войнам, предательствам и открытиям, которые перевернут ваше представление о жанре.[/i]

[b]Основа игры: Механики, которые затягивают на сотни часов[/b]
[i][list]
[*] [b]Создание своей цивилизации:[/b] Stellaris начинается с того, что вы буквально конструируете расу из десятков параметров: этика (милитаристы, пацифисты, ксенофобы), тип общества (биологическое, роботы, псионики), черты (адаптивность, интеллект, агрессия) и даже внешность. Хотите играть за миролюбивых космических слизней, строящих галактическую федерацию? Или за машинную империю, стремящуюся ассимилировать все органические расы? Здесь возможно всё.

[*] [b]Исследование и открытия:[/b] Галактика в Stellaris генерируется случайно, и каждое новое игра — это путешествие в неизвестность. Вы будете:
- Исследовать аномалии (например, древние руины или гравитационные аномалии).
- Встречать кризисы (вторжение внегалактических захватчиков, восстание синтетиков).
- Заключать союзы или уничтожать соседей.

[*] [b]Дипломатия и войны:[/b] 
- Дипломатия: От торговых соглашений до создания федераций — здесь можно решать судьбы галактики без единого выстрела.
- Войны: Система военных целей позволяет вести не тотальные войны, а конфликты с чёткими задачами (захват системы, освобождение вассала).
- Шпионаж и провокации: Саботаж, кража технологий, поддержка повстанцев — идеально для любителей «тихих» конфликтов.

[*] [b]Экономика и управление:[/b] 
- Балансировка ресурсов (энергия, минералы, пища, потребительские товары) — основа процветания.
- Планирование заселения планет, строительство мегасооружений (кольцевые миры, сферы Дайсона) и управление населением с уникальными потребностями.
[/list][/i]

[i][b]Сильные стороны: Почему Stellaris покоряет сердца[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]Нарративная глубина:[/b] События в игре — это не просто текст, а истории с последствиями. Например, обнаружение «Храмового комплекса» может привести к пробуждению древнего бога-червя, который переформатирует вашу расу, или к гибели всего живого в секторе.

[*] [b]Реиграбельность:[/b] Благодаря случайной генерации галактики, сотням событий и возможности создавать уникальные цивилизации, каждая партия кардинально отличается от предыдущей.

[*] [b]Моддерская поддержка:[/b] Stellaris обладает одной из самых активных моддерских сообществ. Моды добавляют новые расы, сюжеты, механики и даже полностью меняют сеттинг.

[*] [b]Постоянное развитие:[/b] Paradox регулярно обновляет игру, исправляя ошибки и добавляя новые фичи. Даже спустя 7 лет после релиза Stellaris остаётся актуальной.
[/list][/i]

[h1]Плюсы:[/h1]
[i][list]
[*] [b]Беспрецедентная свобода творчества:[/b] Создавайте уникальные расы с собственной этикой, чертами и историей. Хотите играть за пацифистов-грибов или машин-уничтожителей? Всё возможно. Проработанная система происхождений (например, «Потерянная колония» или «Синтетическая эволюция») задаёт тон всей партии.

[*] [b]Нарративная глубина:[/b] Сотни случайных событий, археологических цепочек и кризисов превращают игру в космическую сагу. Истории в духе научной фантастики: от восстания ИИ до встречи с божественными червями.

[*] [b]Реиграбельность:[/b] Случайная генерация галактики, разные типы кризисов (вторжение Пожирателей, Восстание машин) и бесконечные комбинации рас обеспечивают уникальность каждой партии.

[*] [b]Дипломатия и взаимодействие:[/b] От создания федераций до подрывных операций — здесь есть инструменты для любой стратегии. Возможность играть без войн, побеждая через культурное доминирование или политические интриги.

[*] [b]Моддерская поддержка:[/b] Огромная библиотека модов: от новых рас и кораблей до полных переработок вселенной (например, «Star Trek» или «Warhammer 40K»).

[*] [b]Атмосферность:[/b] Эпичный саундтрек, стилистика кораблей и планет, голосовые оповещения — всё это погружает в атмосферу живой галактики.

[*] [b]Постоянное развитие:[/b] Paradox регулярно обновляет игру, добавляя новые механики и исправляя ошибки.

[*] [b]Достижения:[/b] Присутствие получения различных достижений, что добавляет элемент соревновательности и мотивации с другими игроками которые смогли получить сложные достижения с особыми условиями.

[*] [b]Коллекционные предметы:[/b] Присутствуют обои, смайлики, карточки из которых можно скрафтить значки
[/list][/i]

[h1]Минусы:[/h1]
[i][list]
[*] [b]Высокий порог вхождения:[/b] Десятки ресурсов, технологий и механик могут перегрузить новичков. Обучение в игре поверхностное.

[*] [b]Проблемы с оптимизацией:[/b] На поздних стадиях игра начинает лагать, особенно в больших галактиках. Мультиплеер часто страдает от десинхронизации.

[*] [b]Дисбаланс механик:[/b] Некоторые стратегии (например, спам роботами или «танкирование» инфляции) остаются неоправданно сильными. ИИ часто действует нелогично: мирные империи внезапно объявляют войны, а ксенофобы предлагают союзы.

[*] [b]Повторяемость:[/b] После 100+ часов цепочки событий и диалоги начинают повторяться. Кризисы следуют одним и тем же сценариям.

[*] [b]Зависимость от DLC:[/b] Без дополнений (например, Utopia или Apocalypse) игра ощущается неполной. Многие «крутые» фичи (кольцевые миры, титаны) locked за платными DLC.

[*] [b]Ограниченная роль личности:[/b] Лидеры и фракции слабо влияют на игру. Их смерть или смена редко меняют курс империи.
[/list][/i]

[h1]Заключение:[/h1]
[i]Stellaris — это не просто игра. Это симулятор бесконечности, где каждая звезда может стать домом для новой цивилизации, а каждый чёрный ящик — хранить секреты, способные изменить галактику. Да, здесь есть проблемы с балансом и оптимизацией, но когда ваш флот из тысяч кораблей вступает в бой с внегалактическими захватчиками под эпичную музыку, вы понимаете: это не просто код и спрайты. Это — настоящее космическое приключение.[/i]

第一，这个游戏我玩这么久了，从来没有使用过任何作弊工具进入对战平台，连人机也没有使用过！
第二，我玩这个游戏的时候曾经确实使用过第三方的工具，不过也是用于通关剧情模式的。但是这个游戏也没有说过使用第三方工具通关剧情模式也会被封号吧？？？而且也是我很早以前使用过的。

在今天，我想通过STEAM的推荐系统，对水雷社的开发人员讲！这是我辛辛苦苦养的第二个号，结果在又被封了！希望能给我的线上权限解BAN，我也会持续在社区平台和水雷社的官方留言板上继续上诉！！直到解封为止！

Hello everyone! I am an old player who has been playing this game for a long time. I rarely go to the Sky Ladder PK and usually use drones for retirement. The game is indeed a good game, but I have witnessed the inexplicable account suspension!!! I would like to say to customer service or developers:
Firstly, I have been playing this game for so long and have never used any cheating tools to enter the battle platform, not even the human-machine interface!
Secondly, I did use third-party tools when playing this game, but they were also used to clear the storyline mode. But this game has never mentioned that using third-party tools to complete the storyline mode will also result in account suspension, right??? And it's also something I used a long time ago.
Today, I want to talk to the developers of the Minesweeper Society through STEAM's recommendation system! This is the second account I have worked hard to raise, but it has been banned again! I hope to be granted online access to unban, and I will continue to appeal on the community platform and the official message board of the Minesweeper Society!! Until the lockdown is lifted! | One of the greatest RTS games ever made and significantly better than 3 which is an absolute pos game. My recommendation if you want the dlc for this game is to go online and find a cheap steam key for the ""all out war edition"" usually around 8$. Gives you every single dlc in the game including all playable factions, so don't waste your money on individual dlc which will cost you a fortune. | I don't even know where to start. The gameplay can be satisfying at times but almost every other aspect of the game is downright frustrating and/or pathetic. Had I known that the campaign was strictly Russia vs Germany, I wouldn't have bought it. Had I known how greedy the game is with all the microtransactions and extra dlc you have to buy for a complete game, I wouldn't have bothered. 

You cannot play as either British or American forces unless you pay extra. Furthermore, you cannot play as any army except for Russia in any of the one-off skirmish maps, unless you pay extra. Also, there are campaign missions that it shows you in-game where you play as the allies, but to play them you have to pay extra. Showing you the other half of what the game should have been with price tags and store page links inside the damn game is so insulting. 

I got it relatively cheap on the winter sale, otherwise I would've refunded it. Odds are, you won't have a good time with this game. I hear Coh3 is even worse, so there you go. Another dead franchise swallowed up by corporate greed. | This game is timeless. not sure what is it that brings me back to it. it is not perfect especially the campaign, but the multiplayer comes so close to perfection. | Game no longer loads, tried every solution possible, nothing.

76561197999259031,288120,Dungeonmans,3.066666666666667,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",1,"Amazing old-school game. Very tactical and fun. There are a lot of easter eggs and references in it.
You don't need to fear death. It will get you sooner or later.
You WILL die... horribly.
There are times you will want to hide in the corner of a dungeon crying.
And no one will save you.
No one.

But true Dungeonmans fear no death!!!
They eat death at breakfast.
They live forever! | I really want to like this game, but there's just too much going against it. I'm gonna try to organise this to be a bit more digestible.

[h3]TL;DR[/h3]
-Sometimes tediously easy, sometimes very deadly
-Low feeling of control over some deaths
-Very easy to ""slip up"" and lose hours of progress
-Inventory system is clunky but frequently used
-Limited amount of actual content/gameplay
-Small annoyances add up
-Your save file might randomly get borked

[h3]Balancing & Permadeath[/h3]
Progression balance doesn't really exist in this game. You'll effortlessly clear 3 dungeons in a row, then round a corner and get insta-bopped by a champion. Oops, there go the past 5 hours!

Permadeath stings particularly bad when dying feels like it's out of your control. Here are some examples:
1) The tower dungeon boss slaps you with 5x5 area hits that can one-shot unarmored builds.
2) The infamous ""Triger"" can again one-shot many low-armor builds, if in melee range.
3) A champion mummy surprised one run with a curse for 1/4th of max health per turn for 100 turns.
4) Trickster spellcasters can strip away your life-preserving buffs at inopportune moments.

[h3]Cost of Learning[/h3]
All of the above cases are technically avoidable, but require you to make that deadly mistake at least once to learn what to avoid, which can cost you hours of time to recover from. Plus, there are situations where multiple high threats overlap in unavoidable ways, or you simply fail to notice one change among the dozens of enemies/buffs/debuffs on screen. 

[h3]Inventory Management[/h3]
Consumable spamming is expected to be your answer to most dangers. Thing is, your inventory is shown as an ever-growing list that takes longer and longer to navigate with time. Even favoriting just the ""essentials"" easily fills up more than a page, and it becomes very clunky and tedious to repeatedly access. The UI just isn't designed to handle that many items or be easily accessible.

[h3]Repetition, Repetition...[/h3]
On the subject of tedium, the gameplay loop is very small. The only thing you really do is grind, grind, grind, and I find myself getting bored after the 10th dungeon with similar enemies. Only about 5% of players have the achievement for beating the game, and I suspect difficulty isn't the only reason for that.

[h3]Small Irritations[/h3]
There are little things a bit everywhere that hamper the experience. Little things like having to go all the way back to the academy after every dungeon to cache in your relics (before you die and lose them), or the statue in the middle of the path that makes you walk around it instead of just walking up, or enemy animations that take just a little too long before you can take your turn. They're not that big of a deal on their own, but do add up.

[h3]Crashes & Save Corruption[/h3]
I haven't had this as bad as some people, but I did lose an early-stage world to corruption. I could see this being particularly harmful if it happened later in a save file.


Thank you for coming to my TED talk, I didn't realise I was going to write this much. | One of my favorite games in my favorite genre. The real joy of dungeonmans is that it applies roguelite progression to the traditional roguelike formula. It also features an extremely flexible and open-ended skill system that lets you make powerful chracters, and it has a ton of content. It's old but it's great, and I've silently enjoyed it ever since it came out.

To the dev, congrats on your thousandth review and here's to ten more years of dungeonmanning :) | This game pisses me off. It keeps putting me in my place when I start feeling overconfident and bored and I'm lowkey a little angry at the creator cause that makes it feel like some unspoken war that's been started between us and I'll be damned if I lose.

I don't buy merch, either, but I'd deface some random property with Proof of Stremf stickers, given the chance. Haha.

Just play it. Go be annoyed like I am. It's fun. | Kill monsters, level up, get all the loot, laugh at the jokes, die, learn the game more, rinse/repeat. It isn't easy, but it's fun and rewarding.

It's a great turn-based dungeon crawling roguelike, loads of replay value from classes and loot and whatnot, cool systems, and chickens."
76561197999259031,291410,Duelyst,3.216666666666667,"Free To Play, Indie, Strategy",6,"When it comes to Duelyst, the comparison with Hearthstone is easily made. The way you earn cards is the same, the ranked system is the same, the mana system is the same and the way classes work is the same, complete with special power.

However, there's a few very key differences between the two games that make Duelyst less random and, to me at least, more fun: The board on which you play as well as the ability to replace a card from your hand once per turn.

The board in combination with the various cards makes for some really deep and satisfying tactical play that allows you to bend the game to your favour with smart decisions. Every turn the board looks different as there's so much going on and every turn has a very large amount of decisions that you can make. I really enjoy this the most as a fervent tactical turn-based gamer. If you like the combat in XCOM and Age of Wonders 3, you will find lots to love here.

Other plusses are the quick matchmaking, the active developers, the gorgeous pixel art and animations and the large amount of interesting lore.

I am personally not a fan of random stuff (which is why I stopped playing Hearthstone) and to me Duelyst strikes the perfect balance between randomness and tactics. Highly recommended! | Abosultely love this game! The strategy needed due to the infinite possibilities between the game board, placement of ""cards"", and of course the kick @$$ pixel graphics!!  A very satisfying game that could easily be played and enjoyed without spending a penny of ""real money"".  The daily quests (and free card) can get you enough gold to buy spirit orbs (card packs), gauntlet tickets (arena/draft play) and bloodborn orbs (card packs with cards you DONT have!).  Yes, if you get a crate you need a key to open it which costs $4.99.. BUT they did recently implement a ""common crate"" key reward for 15 quests completed in a month (easy).  However, if you are worried that you will be missing out on items due to not wanting to buy crates they are mostly filled with cosmetic items with 1 card here and there so they are not required to complete your card collection. The last thing I want to touch on, which is one of my favorites, is the fact that each ""faction"" or class does not only have 1 type of general that has the same hero power no matter the skin or avatar.  There are multiple general (main hero/""face"") options for each faction AND your general always has at least 2 attack and can  move around the board like a chess piece, the same as your minions, instead of just being your avatar with a set power that never moves or defends themself without a weapon equipped.

To get the FULL experience and really find out I suggest you JUST PLAY IT.  Nothing to lose since it is F2P, the system requirements are low, and if you want to get a free spirit orb (or just 100 gold) use my referral code ""gdaddanyt"" and friend me to play some matches!! :) | i like the art work and you can't complain about the gameplay really. sure there are some people with awesome cards or decks, but its all about the strategy. it makes you think and it doesnt get boring. if it does, you can always come back to it later and appreciate the workers who put effort into making this game awesome. | Please support Chinese

像素风刚刚开始还是有点难接受，毕竟看惯了3D画面，再改回来有点不习惯。不过深入去玩以后就会发现还是比较不错的，像素风也不是那么难以接受了。
相比于炉石，duelyst加入了战棋的要素，而且大大减少了随机性，让“有实力”的玩家可以真正靠自己的头脑走向胜利（炉石的导演实在是……），缺点就是上手比较难吧，我自己也摸索了好一阵才堪堪入门。

然而，问题不仅仅这么简单，这么优秀的游戏却有着一群跟我们思维构造不同的GM和MOD，他们在没有事先通知的情况下封了几乎所有参加过PVP的人，而且时间有的多达30天甚至是365天，经常玩这个游戏热爱这个游戏每天游戏时间足够长的所有国人无一幸免，而且申诉机制异常奇怪，真正该封禁的人被解封了，无辜群众反而被关在了里面，据一些因为玩游戏频率不高而侥幸逃过一劫的国人反应，本来偏小众的游戏的在线人数进一步减少，本来一场联赛平时1分钟以内就一定能排到对手现在却排了四五分钟都无法匹配成功，游玩人数大量减少，玩家纷纷弃坑，然而面对这种结果，GM和MOD却仍然表示满意，绝对自己做得很是正确。另外，由于这个游戏是人治，所以管理上有明显的偏袒，和mod关系好的人不会被封禁然而其余人很容易被封禁，据少数国人反应，游戏内可能有一定反华倾向，在世界打字中文会收获到举报，总之你一定要做好随时被封禁的心理准备即使你只是正常的老老实实的玩游戏。一次封禁很有可能直接抹消掉你之前的时间和金钱投入，所以，即使这个游戏很有趣，但大家入坑前还是要慎重，即使决定了入坑，购买付费内容的时候还是要慎重，毕竟，他们封禁你的时候不会在乎你花了几百几千人民币的。 | Pros:  I was transported back in time 30 years, the flavor and feel of PnP RPG gaming is perfect.

As someone who grew up in the golden age of Flash browser games, this one always stuck out to me as one of the most consistently good tower defense games in the entire genre. Yes, even better than Bloons.

The tower systems have an unimaginable amount of complexity, and the skill ceiling for their use and design is so stupidly high that people have designed scripts to automatically craft optimal gems with upwards of 50 different components.

However, in order to reach those heights, you first have to get through the game casually, and I must say that this is one of the hardest video games I have ever played. The difficulty of the middle section of the game is bone-crushing, requiring exact precision, map knowledge, and at some points, seemingly just grinding for skill points to give a final push through the hex.

It’s not for the faint of heart, but it is an incredibly good game despite its difficulty. Should you conquer this game’s arduous challenges, you’ll be deeply satisfied, and the post-game content (that is to say, redoing stages in Endless) is very fun and rewarding.

Definitely a hidden gem, even if it is a bit rough. | Quite okay. Fun for plenty of time for an okay price. The game is fun at the beginning, then is pain called ""getting to Amplifiers"", then is fun again for a while. Not quite balanced, but pretty fun regardless. Worth checking out generally speaking, and definitely when on a sale. | Simple, yet fun. Graphics are good enough, gameplay is addictive. And its quite cheap. | Played a version of this ages ago, Gem Craft is from a time when tower defense games had to actually be good to get published anywhere outside of flash game websites. The fact that I'm willing to pay money for a tower defense game speaks volumes about how much playtime I'm about to give this game. | Good tower defense game play. 
Gem combining & upgrading, mixing elements &
attributes makes for some interesting combos.
Graphics is another thing entirely.
Your tower is a shiny box with a hole for your gem.
Did I mention you can build walls?
It's well worth $2 even if I haven't unlocked the amplifier yet.

The art style and music are neat and well done, but I found the game itself to be incredibly punishing. Getting one shot by enemy attacks, or failing because I accidentally shot a friendly was definitely frustrating, but I could work with that, and when that is all that I have to worry about, then the game can be rather fun. What really made me not want to play the game anymore was the apples / litter. Perhaps if your bullets were a lot faster, then I would be more amenable to the existence of apples, but failing a level because I didn't shoot an apple in time felt frustrating in a way that simply wasn't fun. | An adorably simple FPS that keeps you engaged with ramping difficulty as you progress.  Blazing through the first 11 levels kept me somewhat interested but had me hoping that I wouldn't get bored too quickly.  Right after finishing this stage did I finally notice the star ranking system and how I only had 2/3 stars... defeat every enemy, finish the level under the par time, and stay 100% accurate.  This really opened my third eye in terms of fun and getting 3 stars on a given level before advancing to the next one was my definitive way to enjoy the game.  

Lovely Planet's projectile flower gun particularly scratches my itch for skillful gunplay which plays incredibly well for bombs that must be shot midair before they reach the ground.  Each shot is fairly slow so you'll have to consider each bomb's current speed and your distance away from it to get those satisfying airshots, the game is no slouch from expecting you to not only play through it quickly but also be ready to sometimes shoot several at a time in quick succession.  Lovely Planet's other mechanics are slowly introduced in each world and help encourage you to play the game in the most enjoyable way possible.  Much like it's arcade contemporaries there are plenty of easier ways to play if the game is giving you too much trouble.  Your gun is semi-automatic so shooting bombs and enemy fire makes things considerably easier, the game does force you to play fast at times but these are more along the lines of micro challenges over playing an entire level quickly from start to end.

I had just about no issues with the game aside from some Japanese text not being translated and would've loved to have an optional crosshair.  The game is more than playable regardless but these are small blemishes on an otherwise great experience.  All in all a short but satisfying arcade shooter, absolutely worth the purchase if you're up for a somewhat challenging time with a relaxing artstyle! | Nome: Lovely Planet

I saw this game on a super sale and never had the thought on my mind to get this when it came out when it first released, and super glad that did. The game doesn't say a single word just noises from the characters, the game is mainly a button masher with combo keys to defeat your enemies that you come across by yourself, or with your friends. The game is however having a shelf life of over a decade to strike your opponent you have to perfectly in line with them to land a hit on them. You are able to battle your friends near the end of some of the missions to see who can get the princess. Which I think is really interesting idea because it incorporates testing your skills against your team mates on whether or not you are carrying them through out the game, to see if they can match up to you on your level and compete against them while playing with them to defeat the missions.
The only issue that I do see in this game if you are playing this on PC that you have to make sure that you join while you are out of game and someone invites you while they are in game, and by launching it from the invite window, or you will be counted as two players, one counting as the keyboard, and the other counting as your controller.

In my opinion, this is a really fun and enjoyable game that you can play with yourself or your friends that you are on with. I got this game on a super sale, and even thought that this game is fun and enjoyable to play on.

Очень любил эту игру до того,как разработчики испортили её.Раньше все старались построить хорошие машины,выбрать те оружия,которые им по душе.Были Тиры,и каждый Тир был сбалансирован,не было через чур(были,но немного) сильный противников.Было Древо улучшений.А сейчас - разнацветные кубики,пыль,кейсы,игроки строят коробки на одной ножке или коробки с ротором и цепляют на него самые имбалансные пушки,которые выпали из купленных кейсов.Подбор противников просто ужасен.Игру облегчили для максимума(чтобы любой идиот,у которого есть деньги мог играть в это и донатить как можно больше) и превратили в помойку.Раньше было намного лучше.Разработчикам важен только донат,а не сама игра. | Uwaga! Opis mechanik gry jest już przestarzały(wyjaśnienie na końcu);

Dobry przykład jak ze świetnej gry zrobić totalnego gniota bez balansu nastawionego na grind i mikrotranzakcje wymuszające kupno premium by mieć jakąkolwiek szansę normalnego rozwoju konta. Gra kilka lat temu była świetna, przyjemny rozwój robotów, przyjemne walki, gra była nastawiona na umiejętności budowy robotów, co było bardzo ważną umiejętnością, a walka polegała na starannym niszczeniu najsłabszych punktów przeciwnika. Było trochę problemów z balansem, ale twórcy kompletnie nie potrafili ich naprawić mimo tego, że gracze pisali wielokrotnie co trzeba zmienić.

Twórcy wszystkie problemy zaczęli ""rozwiązywać"" od najgorszej strony, tworząc przy okazji nowe problemy. Z czasem gra straciła jakikolwiek sens posiadania umiejętności budowy, ponieważ teraz często liczy się kto pierwszy zaatakuje, a nie skill. Tutaj już nawet nie trzeba budować, twórcy dali możliwość kupowania robotów innych graczy, przez co nie ma sensu się starać, lepiej kupić potężnego bota aktualnej mety, po co budować, skoro wszystko i tak będzie gorsze? Tu też przychodzi drugi problem, balans. Zawsze był z tym problem, lecz kiedyś nie aż tak duży. Jak zwykle twórcy nie potrafią rozwiązywać problemów, przez to w grze jest pewna tzw. ""meta"", czyli najskuteczniejsze boty w grze. Przez idotyczne decyzje twórców ta liczba w tej chwili wynosi bodajże 3(tak, 3 typy robotów są skutecznie na wyższym poziomie umiejętności, reszta to strata nerwów i przegrywanie). Mobilność bota jest wszystkim ponieważ nawet najtwardsze boty topnieją w chwilę, więc nie ma sensu budować niczego innego. Chcesz pobawić się tworząc ładnie wyglądającego bota? Zapomnij, chyba, że nie masz nic przeciwko przegrywaniu 3/4 gier. Twórcy nie potrafią rozwiązać jakichkolwiek problemów z balansem. Do tego doszedł system skrzynek, który polega po prostu na tym, że gigantycznie zmniejszył średnią zdobywaną kasę za bitwę oraz zachęca do kupowania premium w postaci ""patrz, super rzadki item, kup premium to go dostaniesz!"". Bitwa za bitwą a zbudować to, co przedtem mogliśmy po ~30 bitwach teraz musimy zagrać ich ~200. Chyba, że ma się farta i się wydropi legendarny przedmiot. Ewentualnie gra pokaże go w slocie premium i będzie chciała zachęcić do jego kupna. Recykling bezużytecznych itemów na kasę w grze daje idiotycznie małe wartosci, prawie nic, gracze domagali się podniesienia wartości recyklingu, po wielu miesiącach, twórcy w końcu zrobili to, ale tylko, kiedy ma się premium(!), powodując, że teraz premium nie tylko dwukrotnie zwiększa ilośc itemów ze skrzynek, to teraz trzykrotnie zwiększa wartość recyklingu każdego itema. p2w tego nie można do końca nazwać, ale definitywnie jest to PayWall. Aktualne premium powoduje, że otrzymamy tyle, ile przed updatem zanim zmniejszyli nagrody za bitwy. Grając za darmo otrzymujemy 6x mniej. Powodzenia zbudować bota z ulubionym wyposażeniem. Gra bez premium to katorga, W dodatku gra jest wieczną alfą, co służy tylko temu, by twórcy mogli sobie dowoli zmieniać so chcą, np. jeszcze bardziej zwiększając rolę mikropłatności w grze. W rzeczywistości gra jest w gorszym stanie niż 2,5 lat temu. Kilka miesięcy temu było baardzo źle i weterani uciekali od tego szajsu. Teraz jest jeszcze gorzej.

Podsumowując: Stuprocentowy negatyw.

@edit 24.05.2019 r.
Sporo się zmieniło, nie ma już lootboxów, powrócili (nieudolnie) do tierów oraz drzewka technologii. Gra jest nadal masakryczna. Fizyka skopana, najlepsze roboty to pojedyncza broń T5 na lekkim i szybkim(najlepiej latającym) bocie. ""Connecting To Server"" wszędzie, a w dodatku by zniwelować ubytek graczy nie można już wybrać trybu gry z rotacją co godzinę. Tak. Ta sama mapa, ten sam tryb, te same ustawienia PRZEZ GODZINĘ. Dodali ulepszanie broni(by zadawały jeszcze więcej DMG!), więc TTK jeszcze bardziej zmniejszyli(za czasów Overclockingu ludzie nienawidzili buffowania DMG, widać twórcy nic się nie nauczyli). Robopassy dające jakieś kiepskie kosmetyczne przedmioty by trochę kasy wyciągnąć z umierającej gry.
Od Grudnia 2018 r. stracili połowę istniejących graczy. Jak to zrobili? Pośrednio twórcy w końcu zobaczyli, że Robocraft z początków był lepszy, więc próbują wprowadzać rzeczy i mechanikę, która była w tamtym czasie. Problem jest taki, że po pierwsze robią to nieumiejętnie, po drugie, że nadal próbują swoje ""nowości"". Na końcu otrzymujemy dziadostwo, w które nie da się grać. W tą grę gra mniej ludzi niż w Spore. I pomyśleć, że Robocraft ze swoją unikalną receptą na grę posiadał ponad 7 tysięcy aktywnych graczy.

Jakiś czas temu wyszli z Early Access, a przynajmniej zrobili to teoretycznie, bo gra nadal się zmieniała drastycznie. W sumie gra jest w gorszym stanie niż w czasie wczesnego EA.

@Edit, 14.07.2019.
No i stało się. Robocraft upadł. Freejam zwalnia ludzi bo mają mało kasy, przyznali się, że Robocraft po opłaceniu serwerów wychodzi na minus. Wszystkie zasoby idą na RobocraftX(tworzenie gry od początku). Będą utrzymywać serwery tak długo jak to będzie możliwe i naprawiać większe bugi. Kilka lat ludzie pisali co jest źle z grą, mówili jakie błędy popełniają twórcy, wszystko dostali na tacy, twórcy mieli to gdzieś i dalej rozwalali grę po swoją tajemniczą ""wizję"", która się zmieniała co update dalej rozwalając grę dziwnymi rozwiązaniami, o które nikt nie prosił. To się nie mogło inaczej skończyć Radzę nie wydawać nawet grosza na tą grę, bo pieniądze mogą przepaść. | Encontre este juego hace unos años atras. Encontre un potencial exito indie multiplayer, como por ejemplo lo que hoydia es Rocket League.
Me enamore de sus mecanicas, y del desarrollo que Freejam de entregaba a su juego, sin duda yo me alegre bastante cuando Robocraft gano el Indie del Año por parte de IndieDB.

Era esos dias en donde era una Arena 10vs10, donde llegar a Tier 10 te hacia en uno de los mejores del juego. En donde tenias que ser consistente para ir desbloqueando todas las mejoras del arbol de tecnologias. En donde la sinergia del jugador y su maquina, y lo mas importante y lo que actualmente se perdio: completo trabajo en equipo. Y quien llevaba a nivel 100 era considerado un Dios.

Donde la habilidad era para saber construir el mejor vehiculo, en todos los ambitos posibles. En donde se copiaban diseños pero aun asi quedaban con un toque personal.

Esos dias. Antes de las torres. Antes de los Megabots. Antes de los medicos.
Cuando solo habian 3 clases. Y aun asi digo que la inclusion de los medicos dio un giro muy positivo al juego.

Donde TODOS. Iban en una fila por una de las 2 lineas principales del mapa. Y en donde se producia un 50/50 en donde podia quedar la absoluta mie*da en una batalla de 10vs10 frente a frente. Y en donde el equipo contrario llegaria a su base y el equipo de dividia para ir a defender la base.

Updates pasaban y no habia tanto cambio. Incluso la inclusion de las torres era una idea fantastica, y todo el mundo en los foros dio su apoyo. Pero simplemente y en mera opinion mia, no fue ejecutada de manera efectiva, o sonaba mejor en papel. Aun asi el juego era bastante bueno en esos momentos y todavia se apreciaba ese espiritu competitivo. Lo que realmente afecto al juego fue el sistema de respawn. Antes la gente hacia cosas imposibles para sobrevivir. O intentar capturar la base enemiga. Con el respawn vi morir frente a mi todo eso.

Hasta que 2 mecanicas nuevas mataron mi idea original del juego.
Las cajas y el nuevo sistema de ""dinero"".

Incluso yo estaba a favor de perder dinero por reparar el vehiculo cada vez que perdias. Y ahora hasta puedes comprar vehiculos prefabricados.
Seguramente si el juego hubiera ido por buen camino, ahora mismo estaría jugando competitivamente en un clan.

Pero lamentablemente soñar no cuesta nada. Intentar arreglar la dignidad de este juego, mucho.

EDIT:

Me han llegado comentarios que estoy tirando mie*da al juego solamente porque soy (""fui"") ""manco"". Los estoy borrando porque la verdad no demuestran nada objetivo.

This was one of my favorite games back in 2014. It had everything you could ask for: balancing, a good community, active and attentive devs, weapons that complemented each other, fun gameplay, good progression, lack of ""pay2win"" and so forth. Needless to say, it was awesome.

Then the January 2015 update was released.

The January 2015 update added a new gamemode where you destroy towers, levelled up, and respawn if destroyed. Initially, me and the rest of the community thought ""Cool."" and waited to see what else was in store. Little did I know that the downfall of Robocraft had begun.

(Order not completely accurate)

""Megabots"" (gigantic robots basically) were removed as soon as the update came out, if not before.

Crates were introduced (partially replacing the robits system), level based CPU limits eliminated, and the tech tree removed, eliminating progression, reducing creativity, and generally made the game much worse. Despite the huge outcry and the veterans and other players who started to leave the game, the devs simply ignored the community and moved on.

Helicopter blades were added, enabling people to make flying fortresses (maybe literrally). Personally I don't think much of this.

Then weapons, most notably an anti-air cannon and a minigun, were added, making weapons unbalanced and the game more frustrating to play. As a pilot in Robocraft (a more ""traditional"" one who used plasma bombers), this particulary saddened and angered me.

A robot shop was added, further reducing creativity.

An intro was added into the game, giving the game a more ""cheezy"" feel and making it seem as if the developers were copying other games. By this point, I personally felt that the developers were catering more toward children (12 year olds) and no longer valued older players and veterans.

All this time, veterans and other older players were leaving the game as it became increasingly apparent that the developers were not listening to the community. 

A new chat system was added, featuring a clan system that the community had been asking for for a long time. This was not nearly enough however, as the other changes above (as well as others) and the careless developers made the game unenjoyable for me (and potentially other older players, although I can not speak for them on this matter).

I finally left Robocraft for good in mid 2015 (shortly after the new chat system was introduced) after a brief stint operating a hovercraft with SMGs.

In it's current state, Robocraft is unbalanced and unenjoyable. The developers are careless and possibly largely inactive (aside from bugfixes and tweaks). Gameplay is frustrating, gamemodes horrible. 

As another reviewer (spynathan) has said: ""From Robocraft to Robocrap.""

If, somehow, all (and I mean all) changes to the game were reverted back to sometime before the January 2015 update, say, November 2014, me and other members of the community (read their reviews to see what they have to say) who have left Robocraft may very well return.

Until then, goodbye Robocraft. | 看我的游戏时间就知道了。这确实是一个好游戏，我还买了永久会员，但他现在确实让我失望了。我也是从T级时代走过来的人，RC的变化我也历历在目。不过现在，FJ的小霸王服务器，将游戏改的一塌糊涂，各种毒瘤载具对新手的压制，虽然出了简体中文，玩家也更多了，但为什么RC的评价在从好评如潮下滑到褒贬不一呢？我们应该思考，FJ更应该思考。"

В заключении хочу сказать что игра наверное побольшей части подойдет любителям милсима или тем у кого нет денег на рефорджер. | One of the greatest Games i ever player. Very realistic and because of this hard to play. You can see very far. To play hide and seek in LAN with friends was a lot of fun. The engine is not perfect and has bugs but this engine make the world with not much color very realistic. One hit and it could be over. 
In single player campaign you can save one time in a mission what makes things even harder, but i like tough games....

The Arma engine was the beginning of the game DAY Z what was only a mod at the beginning....

A GREAT GAME !!! Thank you bohemia for that great milestone!

The name of the game was ""Operation Flashpoint"" at first but because of the rights from codemasters they had to change the name to ""ARMA"". | Very clunky and can get super buggy but the story is great and the solo missions still stand up I love the time period and weapons. | Its a great game for a low end computer and is pretty fun making ur own maps and stuff | Всьо ужас.

Unturned, Nelson Sexton tarafından geliştirilen ve 2014 yılında erken erişime açılan ücretsiz bir hayatta kalma oyunudur. Oyun, blok tarzı grafiklerle sunulan bir dünyada geçer ve oyuncuların hayatta kalmak için kaynak toplaması, barınak inşa etmesi ve zombilerle savaşması gerekmektedir.

Oynanış:
Unturned, oyunculara geniş bir dünya sunar. Kaynak toplama, yiyecek bulma ve silah yapma gibi temel hayatta kalma unsurlarıyla doludur. Zombilerle dolu bu dünyada, hayatta kalmak için stratejik düşünmek önemlidir. Ayrıca, oyuncular arasında işbirliği yapma veya rekabet etme seçeneği de vardır.

Kendi Yorumum:
Oynanış dinamikleri oldukça eğlenceli ve bağımlılık yapıcı. Özellikle arkadaşlarla birlikte oynandığında, keşif ve hayatta kalma unsurları çok daha keyifli hale geliyor. Ancak, bazen oyunun basit grafikleri ve mekanikleri bazı oyuncular için çekiciliğini azaltabilir.

Grafikler ve Ses:
Unturned, blok tarzı grafiklerle sunulmasına rağmen, bu tasarımın kendine özgü bir cazibesi var. Ses efektleri, oyunun atmosferini destekliyor, ancak bazen daha fazla çeşitlilik bekleyebilirsiniz.

Kendi Yorumum:
Grafikler basit olsa da, bu durum oyunun eğlencesini etkilemiyor. Hatta bazı oyuncular bu tarzı sevebilir. Ancak, daha gerçekçi bir deneyim arayanlar için hayal kırıklığı yaratabilir.

Topluluk ve Mod Desteği:
Unturned, aktif bir topluluğa ve geniş bir mod desteğine sahiptir. Oyuncular, çeşitli modlar ve sunucular aracılığıyla oyunu özelleştirebilir. Bu, oyunun ömrünü uzatır ve farklı deneyimler sunar.

Kendi Yorumum:
Topluluk, oldukça destekleyici ve yenilikçi. Modlar, oyunun eğlencesini artırıyor ve sürekli yeni içerikler sunuyor. Ancak, bazı sunuculardaki toksik davranışlar can sıkıcı olabilir.

Sonuç:
Unturned, hayatta kalma oyunları arasında kendine özgü bir yer edinmiştir. Basit ama eğlenceli yapısıyla, oyunculara hem zorlu hem de keyifli bir deneyim sunar. Eğer arkadaşlarınızla birlikte eğlenceli bir hayatta kalma oyunu arıyorsanız, Unturned kesinlikle denemeye değer. Kişisel olarak, bu oyunun sunduğu eğlence ve topluluk etkileşimleri, onu benim favori oyunlarımdan biri haline getiriyor. | ein bester server und spilt es holt euch das gold dlc | KA*AR ERAYIN BİLGİSAYARININ KALDIRDIĞI TEK OYUN | yes, and yes | 不好玩"

The gameplay consists of using a grappling hook (really just a red line) to swing around in arcing trajectories in order to collide with some red bars. The levels consist of some randomly-placed grey boxes to which are attached red bars. The more bars you collide with (while avoiding collisions with the grey boxes), the higher your score. That's. . . basically the whole game. Pressing ""enter"" allows you to skip to the next level, but as far as I can tell all of the levels are pretty much exactly the same. Just randomly-placed boxes. There doesn't seem to be a clear objective to the game either, aside from simply getting a high score. There is no endgame as far as I can tell.

Honestly, this looks like a simple proof-of-concept prototype that could have been made in Unity in an afternoon. There's hardly any content and the gameplay gets boring after a few minutes. A point in the game's favour is that it's free, so I can't really complain about the price. If you're curious, you might as well download it and try it out for yourself.

Let’s talk about why.

1. Controls: They feel clunky and unresponsive, making even basic movement a chore.

2. Combat: The combat system is unpolished and lacks any sense of satisfaction or strategy.

3. Crafting: While crafting is an important part of the game, the system feels unnecessarily complicated.

4. No Search Feature: One of the most frustrating aspects is trying to find what you want to craft. Without a search bar, you spend too much time scrolling through menus, which ruins the flow of the game.

Hem ağaçları ve çalılıkları ortadan kaldırarak görüşünüzü de temizleyebilirsiniz. Harita tertemiz olunca düşmanlar gözden kaçmıyor, güzel oluyor. Eğer çok ağaç lazım olursa yeni bir dünya oluşturun, ihtiyacınız kadar ağaç ve çalılık kesin ve o dünyayı silebilirsiniz.

So unless you want to spend your money on an abandoned, unfinished project then give it a pass.

It's a real shame, too, because this game could have been great with more work & polish, but sadly that will never happen now. | Isomer is an interesting mixture of surivial and basebuilding gameplay from games such as Dwarf Fortress combined with combat and exploration elements inspired by the Xcom series. The overall premise can be summed as reverse Xcom, you play as an alien force stumbling upon an already habited planet yet seeking to colonize never the less. Starting off with your humble dropship and ten workers, it is your job to survive and thrive in an hostile world. Overall in its inital steam release status, I'd say that Isomer is a very promising game. Currently I feel as though the foundations for a great base building and exploration are present though the content may be too barebones for some. So far I've noticed four diffrent unit classes, a wide array of generated structures for the player to explore and various different building blocks for the player to use. However the selection of middle and late game structures don't seem to be implemented. For example you can build your base to the extent of its layout with lights and lifts to different floors, but there are no doors present in the game nor any sizeable modules and things to fill up these rooms apart from soils to contain reasources.

Hopefully the Dev will be resurrected like jesus was but he can come back as developer jesus and finish the game he started to create. Other than that i would say its a good purchase but its not worth it until the developer decides to use social interaction with the people that payed to fund the creation of Isomer. | While this game is young and isn't that fun or easy to play at this point of time it does still have a good idea behind it and i hope it will turn out better then the other games likes it (towns Etc).

Ich hab jetzt schon etliche Stunden in diesem Spiel verbracht. Es ist einfach so frustrierend was für ein potential dieses Spiel hat, aber komplett ungenutzt bleibt. Nicht nur die kompetenzen der Entwickler sind fraglich.

Die Grafik ist grundsätzlich nicht hochmodern, hat aber einfach einen Reiz.
Waffensounds sind unterirdisch auch Fahrzeuge hören sich richtig schlecht an.

Lächerlich ist, das sobald man Kritik am Spiel äußßert oder verbesserungsvorschläge hat, man sofort ausgeschlossen wird aus dem Forum und den Kommentaren.

Desweiteren betreiben die Entwickler das Spielsystem derart, das man ewig benötigt um etwas Freizuschalten. Hat man erstmal alles... sammeln sich die Credits natürlich über die Zeit sofern man nicht gerade 200.000Cr für ein Camo ausgibt.

Zu dem sind die Entwickler ULTRA FAUL, jeder deutsche Panzer hat beispielsweise das selbe Camo. Es wird sich also in keinster Weise mühe gegeben wirklich individualität zu schaffen.
Man muss sich folgendes vor Augen führen: Vor einem halben Jahr oder länger haben sau viele Panzer Camos bekommen, auf deutscher Seite haben alles die gleichen bekommen. Der Panzer ""Panther"" wurde außenvor gelassen. Erst vor kurzen haben dann der Panther und die Panzer IV ebenfalls Camos bekommen, ABER GENAU DIE SELBEN! Es wurde also einfach die Texture/UVMap ""Copy and Paste"" gemacht und auf den Panther und Panzer IV geklebt. Und dafür haben die nen halbes Jahr gebraucht.

Nun zu meinen größen Kritikpunkt und warum man dieses Spiel nicht herunterladen sollte:

Reperaturkosten für Waffen und Fahrzeuge!
Es ist ja völlig legitim das man Munition als Spieler eventuell bezahlen muss. Aber wenn mir dann noch vorgeschrieben wird WIE ich meine Munition nutzen soll, bekomm ich das kotzen!.

Wenn man einfach durch die gegend baller, oder im Kreis fährt mit dem EIGENEN Fahrzeug, wird man für ""EXP-FARMING"" gebannt.

Nicht zu letzt zahlt man für ein voll aufgepimptes STG44 bei einer 20/1 K/D mehr Reperaturen/Munition pro Match als man aus herausholen kann.

Und am besten ist wenn klamm heimlich nach einem Update die Reperaturkosten erhöht wurden!

Es hapert in diesem Spiel an so vielen dingen, man kann diese garnicht alle hier aufzählen. Es ist komplett:

-unfertig
-nicht richtig durchdacht
-spieler unfreundlich


Seit vielen Jahren hat sich an den Maps auch nichts geändert. Hin und wieder ändern sich mal gebäude oder positionen auf den Maps, aber die Spawnpoints sind immernoch die gleichen behinderten Spawnpoints. 

Ohne sinn und verstanden werden hier komplett sinnfrei Inhalte verändert und es wird sich nicht um die EIGENTLICHEN probleme im Spiel gekümmert. So zumbeispiel bleiben Projektile von Panzern einfach in Büschen hängen, oder ein Flugzeug kann einfach mal eine 75mm HE oder APCR wegstecken als wäre es ein laues lüftchen. Dabei ist es schon schwer als Panzerfahrer Flugzeuge zu treffen! Und das ist absolut keine Ausnahme! Sondern generell so!

Das aller schlimmste um was sich die Entwickler aber noch immernicht gekümmert haben obwohl es seit JAHREN angeprangert wird, ist der P-38 Flugzeug spamm, die P-38 kann jeden Panzer easy wegputzen und Auch Jeeps oder Motorräder sind kein problem. Das Spiel wird prinzip sofort unspielbar wenn mehr als 2 P-38 in der Luft sind. Besonders die Fallschirmspringer freuen sich!

Und was Flugzeuge angeht wäre wir beim nächsten Problem! Die Flugabwehrwaffen in diesem Spiel sind so extrem LÄCHERLICH, man kann einem Flugzeug mit einer VIERLINGSFLAK (4x20mm) mal so garkeinen wirklichen Schaden zufügen, aber die Piloten wissen EXAKT wo die Flugabwehr auf den Maps sitzt! Keine chance und mit der mobilen Flak auch keine chance.

Auch mit einer 20mm Bordkanone am Fahrzeug des Scharfschützen macht man dem Flugzeug keinen schaden, APCR/HE egal was man durchlädt. Aber die 20mm der Flugzeuge..... die Pustet alles von der Karte! Und genau das ist der Witz an der sache! Das ist schon IMMER und EWIG bekannt und wird nicht GEFIXT!

Im umkehrschluss kann man weder als Panzerfahrer noch als normaler Infanterist was gegen moderate bis gute Piloten machen! Währenddessen Infanteristen Panzer mit AT-Waffen mal eben in 3 Sekunden auflösen können, während Panzerfahrer keine gute rundumsicht genießen können ohne nicht die Rübe heraus zu stecken.

Ebenfalls ein riesen Fail ist das Panzerbalancing: Vergleich Hellcat gegen Panther.
Beide Fahrzeuge haben APCR und beide Fahrzeuge können sich gegenseitig mit zwei schüssen zerstören. Ja der Panther hat eine höhere Mündungsgeschwindigkeit was das Zielen minimal vereinfacht auf sehr großen Distanzen, solche Distanzen gibt es aber kaum bis garnicht im Spiel.
Durch die APCR Munition der Hellcat wird auch der Panzerungsvorteil des Panthers komplett weg negiert! 

Währenddessen die Hellcat praktisch genauso gut gepanzert ist wie der Panther und auch mit zwei schüssen einen Panzer der gleichen Klasse zerstören kann, ist die Hellcat im kontrast aber mal einfach so mobil wie ein Jeep. Und dazu kommt ein kleines Profil und ein sehr gutes Camo.


Also wurde auch hier beim Balancing TOTAL geschlafen. Und dabei wurden die Entwickler auch schon MEHRFACH auf das problem hingewiesen!

Die Entwickler sind einfach blutige Amateure. 


Daher empfehle ich auf das Spiel zu verzichten.

Tips für alle die dieses Spiel trotzdem Spielen wollen:
Am besten ihr Spiel nur mit Schaufel/Messer in möglichst langen Matches und versucht Fahnen/Eroberungspunkte zu sammeln. Den Ihr könnt so ofte Sterben wie ihr wollt ihr Zahlt keine Reperatur für Nahkampfwaffen und bekommt den vollen Paypout.

Oder Ihr hab nen Panzer und seit gut darin gute deutsche Modelle wären der 38t, Luchs, Panther und Königstiger. Dann kann man gut Credits farmen.
Das gleiche gilt für Flugzeuge. | Purtroppo il gioco è incredibilmente orientato al grinding e cerca in ogni modo possibile, patch dopo patch, di farti aprire il portafoglio (ammesso tu non voglia passare mesi per avere qualcosa).
Gli sviluppatori non ascoltano la community, delle tantissime buone idee che vengono suggerite ogni giorno sia sul forum di Steam che su quello del gioco ne viene presa una minima parte e mescolata con cose che nessuno ha chiesto (e che, spesso, nessuno vuole) e per ogni problema che viene risolto ne vengono inseriti altri.
Nelle suddette patch vengono inoltre ""ninjate"" cose tipo l'aumento di prezzi, la diminuzione dell'exp (dal quale dipendono i crediti) per determinate azioni; ovviamente non viene emesso alcun changelog in modo che non si sappia (di solito queste passano sotto il nome di ""hotfix"").
Le armi sono veramente irrealistiche e sbilanciate, la cosiddetta ""war"" (schermata ""generals"") è ancora più sbilanciata e viene spesso monopolizzata da una piuttosto che dall'altra fazione, la fazione tedesca è ridicola.
Spero vivamente che queste (e le tante altre) cose vengano prima o poi recepite da Reto e corrette, sia a livello di codice che di comportamento degli sviluppatori, ma fintanto che ciò non avverrà sconsiglio il gioco. | 一款不错的游戏

 | I'm afraid I cannot recommend this game. I tried, I played it for a while and I might continue to play it (in a more limited way), but honestly I think I'm done.

There are a few technical problems with the game:
Performance of the game varies highly between updates. I got anything from sustained 60 fps (with vsync on) at high quality setting to 20-25 on the lowest quality.
Weird lag issues. Game freezes momentarily on certain occasions, sometimes at crucial events, eg. just before being killed. This is not related to CPU or memory nor GFX card. I doubt it's network related. If it is, it's server side.

The game also feels a bit unbalanced. If enemy has air superiority, you're doomed. As ground unit there's not a lot you can do. This brings me to the next frustrating fact: you have several characters each has several weapons. You cannot swap [strike]characters or[/strike] weapons during a match. You have to leave the match, leave the squad and then you can swap weapons.

[i]EDIT: apparently you can swap characters if you have more than one of the same class. Thanks to RooZ for bringing this up. I haven't tested it, though. Swapping for a different class is possible if the squad has proper slots[/i]

There's a lot of griding as many have said. Personally I don't mind griding per se. What  I do mind is having to play for extended amount of time at a severe disadvantage. So either you pay money to upgrade fast or you are basically working for Reto as unpaid cannon fodder for their paying customers. In some games if you're good you may get a fighting chance. But not here. As infantry - yes. As tank crewman, not really. You will be put against superior tanks that you cannot harm with your puny cannon. And when you die you'll have to wait before spawning again and then walk or drive for a while to get to the action. There's a lot of waiting and walking in this game. I guess that makes it a more realistic military simulation. ;)

The grind is the price of a free game you say. Fair enough. However this game also suffers from the same problems as any other FPS, free or not. The lack of teamplay. When I first started playing H&G I saw how team actions (capturing) actually gives you significantly more score points compared to just killing an enemy. I said ""wonderful, they found a way to make people actually do objectives"". Sadly I was mistaken. Points schmoints. There are still very few people who will actively engage in coordinated cooperative gameplay. You'll get a circle of campers just outside capture zone. People will use resources without considering they're limited and waste them. Tank drivers will not rotate tanks so that support gunners may engage targets. Vehicles with MGs are never parked with their guns facing enemy positions. A fair amount will not follow common sense regarding objective selection and some will even roam aimlessly around the map.

I'd gladly pay money for a game with a nice teamplay-oriented community but this one isn't it.

So, should you play this free game? After all I said I might continue. If you do, stick to infantry, most vestatile, easiest to survive. Get a car or a motorbike to get from spawn area to the action. If you go for any other class, expect a lot more grinding and consider that your leveling strategy and point investment may be subverted by game designers at any point."

76561197999259031,200110,Unknown,21.266666666666666,,17,"Ну что ж, я провёл в Носготе более 200 часов, из которых большая часть - в закрытой бете, так что пора бы написать обзор к этой игре. Обзор будет скорее для тех, кто только начал или заинтересовался игрой, с некоторой толикой своих личных мыслей по поводу отдельных моментов. 

Начать, пожалуй, следует с того, чем же меня заинтересовала игра. А заинтересовала она меня с первых скриншотов, на которых я увидел близкий мне жанр фэнтези, со своей атмосферой и магией. Меня сразу же зацепили отзывы, в которых другие игроки описывали происходящее не иначе как шахматной партией, только здесь соперничают не 2 игрока, а 8, и от каждого требуется слаженность действий, сосредоточенность и умение правильно оценить положение обеих команд. Учитывая, что каждая шахматная партия неповторима, можно провести подобную аналогию и с Носготом, ибо здесь каждый матч наполнен своим драйвом и непредсказуемостью. 

Но некоторые могут закричать: ""Да это же КС, только у людей огнестрел, а у вампиров рукопашка, в КС тоже надо работать командой, и вообще, чтобы открывать кейсы тоже нужны мозги!"" Нет. Ничего подобного. Работу командой подразумевает каждая кооп-игра, для открывания кейсов действительно нужны мозги, но для того, чтобы понять, что на эти самые кейсы не стоит тратиться. А вот на пункте об оружии остановлюсь поподробнее. Да, в игре 2 команды: люди и вампиры, у первых огнестрельное оружие, а вторые в основном полагаются лишь на свои когти в ближнем бою. Но и у тех, и у других есть особые навыки, помогающие одним убивать, а другим выживать. В игре пока что присутствует 4 класса людей, 4 класса вампиров. Их подробное описание с гайдами можно найти в сообществе, так что перечислю в двух словах. 

[h1] Люди: [/h1] 
1) Охотник - своеобразный танк, имеющий нехилый урон и от своего арбалета, и от навыков; 
2) Алхимик - гранатомётчик, самый дамажащий член команды, с возможностью хила союзников; 
3) Скаут - снайпер с луком; 
4) Пророк - маг с пистолетами, по мощи сравнимыми с обрезами. 

[h1] Вампиры: [/h1]
1) Ривер (переводится как ""похититель"", но оригинал, как по мне, звучит лучше) - настоящий охотник, выжидающий свою жертву, а затем неожиданно нападающий словно из ниоткуда; 
2) Громила (""деспот"" с английского мне не нравится) - танк, наносит большой урон, но крайне медленный; 
3) Сентинел (""часовой"") - летающий вампир, способность летать очень доставляет, к тому же он единственный, кому вообще доступна возможность полёта; 
4) Десивер (""обманщик"") - своеобразный маг вампиров, может контролировать разум людей, превращаться в них, а также становиться невидимым. 

И это еще не все, ведь у каждого класса есть по несколько навыков, причем их можно настроить в разных сочетаниях под свой стиль игры + разработчики обещают ввести в игру минимум 2 класса (1 человек - 1 вампир) в ближайшее время. 
Но саме главное в игре - антураж. Именно атмосфера игры и стала той особенностью, которая поймала меня на крючок. Ну действительно, где еще можно разыграть партию вампиры против людей на средневековую тематику? | Сложно однозначно сказать про эту игру. С одной стороны Носгот прекрасен, но с другой отвратителен. 
Я провел в этой игре много часов. Проведу еще больше. Но сегодня захотелось выговориться, ибо последние 2 вечера игры заставли меня рыдать. В этом я виню только разработчиков! Ну нельзя делать так, как они делают. Это крайне наплевательское отношение к основополагающим проблемам, тянущимся с самого гребаного начала. Сраный матчмейкинг выжимает нервы досуха. Ну нельзя делать в СОЛО-лиге возможность играть фулл-пати. Ну какого хуя должны страдать одиночки вроде меня? Мне осточертело видеть у себя в команде игроков 200-300 часов против 600-1000, трое из которых в пати (а то и все 4). Почему нельзя сделать тонкую настройку ""пати vs пати""? Ну или хотя бы отфильтровать противоборствующие команды по кол-ву игровых часов? Ну это же гораздо показательнее сраных коэффициентных вычислений скилла, которые действуют сейчас! Почему после оглушительного проигрыша, если не ждать, а сразу нажать поиск нового матча, то тебя кидает против все той же гоп-пати? После каждого такого финта мне очень обидно... Обидно за игру, обидно за всех тех, кто покинул игру из-за вышеобозначенной проблемы. Но больше всего мне обидно за себя.
Не существует нейтральной оценки, поэтому ставлю ""не рекомендую"". Тем кому жаль своих нервов, проходите пока что мимо, потому что вы будете страдать.
Ну а что касается меня... ""Мыши плакали, давились, но продолжали есть кактус"". | As almost any negative review is only negative because of the matchmaking (and the person who wrote that review dying constantly), I'm gonna say a little things about that:

They've fixed the matchmaking and even improved it several times. There was just one problem everybody ignored:
Back in Closed Beta the matchmaking could not function properly, as there were not enough players to filter from!

But now in Open Beta you can finally see how the matchmaking works. Everytime I play in a party with several other people, we get split up, because the enemy team would lose directly. Also, the more ""good"" people I have in my party, the longer it takes now to find a match, so the matchmaking is really working in the background.

Now my review about this game:
It's wonderful!
It's quite competitive, so it happens that you lose against people you are playing against, but the most important thing to note is that even though this game is f2p, it is definetly not p2w.
In this game it's not so much about your weapons or skills, as the basic skills can be damn good, if used correctly.
It's mainly about having a good teamplay, and voicechat is not that much required for that. 

Also what I experienced as well, while I introduced some friends of mine to this game, while I was already playing with highlevel players:
You get better over time!

This game has no major flaws, it's just not as casual as people would expect it to be on the normal TDM server.
While in other games as soon as you leave the ""Beginner""-area you lose against p2w players, in this game you are challenged by players, whose only advantage is that they've played more hours in this game than you. 

Have fun! | НАСТОЯЩИЕ (не кавайные ня) ВАМПИРЫ сражаются против матерых людей - охотников на нежить (аля Ван Хельсинг + его арбалет).
Игра строго расчитана на командную игру. Соло геймплей просто невозможен. Все держатся кучками и не разбредаются. 

1 матч, 20 МИН, в кратце: обычно люди ждут волны набегов от вампов. Отсрелялись, зилизались и дальше кучкуются. Вампиры ищут, выдергивают из толпы или врываются в нее, сеют хаос и буквально жрут людей (скил особый, они так лечатся).

Игра брутальная, не требует особой отдачи и задротства. Рекомендую | Endlich mal kein Glitzer.

Das Vampiere und Jäger sich nicht gerade mögen ist altbekannt. Das fast dann auch ganz fix zusammen worum es im Spiel geht. Jäger vs Vampiere. 

Wie funktioniert es:
Jede Runde spielt man auf der Seite einer Fraktion, so dass beide Teams am Ende (2 Runden) jede Fraktion einmal gespielt haben. Am Ende entscheidet sich, wer am meisten Kills (maximal 30 pro Runde) ergattern konnte.

Wie spielt es sich:
Die Jäger sind stark im Fernkampf allerdings überstehen sie nahkämpfe nicht wirklich gut. Teamarbeit ist angesagt und wer alleine rennt ist ziemlich fix Futter für die Vampiere. Als Jäger müssen wir mit einigen Nachteilen Leben, so können wir zum Beispiel nciht auf Häuser klettern. Wir sind an den Boden gebunden. verstecken und Hinterhalte werden hier besonders wichtig. So bieten zum Beispiel Häuer gute Plätze um sich zu verstecken und einen nichts ahnenden Blutsauger dingfest zu machen

Die Vampire verzichten auf Fernkampf sind dafür aber auch stark im Nahkampf. Sie spielen sich daher grundverschieden. Wo die Jäger versuchen ihre Gegner fern zu halten wollen die Vampiere in den Nahkampf. Aber auch für sie gilt, Teamspiel ist angesagt und vorrausehend Spielen. Wer immer den gleichen Gang auf den gegner zurennt lebt nicht lange. Aber was können sie anderes? Die Vampire können klettern und ihnen steht so mehr Raum zum Bewegen zur verfügung, hinzukommen Fertigkeiten um diesen Raum zu überbrücken. Zum Beispiel ein Charge für den Tyran und ein Srung für den ""normalen"" Vampier. Beides wil lgekonnt genutzt werden. 

All das bringt trotz der recht kleinen Leven und 4vs4 Kämpfe eine recht hohe Dynamik ins Spiel. wer sich nach kurzem Spiel einfuchst wird auch schnell Erfolge erzielen und dennoch ordentlich auf die Nase bekommen. Denn beide Seiten haben ihre stärken und schwächen.

Pro:
+Dynamisches Gameplay
+keine glitzer Vampiere
+Rasant und Langsam
+für mich hohes Niveau zum lernen.
+Bugfrei bisher

Negativ:
+Wenig Klassen
+Beide Setien auf Nah oder Fernkampf beschränkt. Ei nVampier der nicht klettern kann mit Fernkampf und ein Nahkampfjäger, welcher Klettern kann wären die Ideale Ergänzung
+kleiner Frameeinbrüche
+Frustgrad ist hoch
+Noch keine Ingamebelohnungen

Fazit: Das Grundgerüst ist solide und solange ein P2W fernbleibt kann ich es nur ans Herzlegen es sich anzusehen, wer von Twilight und Co die Nase voll hat oder mal einen etwas anderen ""Shooter"" spielen will, der sollte gerne einen Blick riskieren. Gefährlich lebt es sich auf jeder Seite, als sei bereit nicht nur ein mal am Anfang zu sterben."

I've been playing Magic for about four years now.
I've owned a few of the other digital game versions as well as having a few competitive decks in real life as well.

It's been no secret that many people have found the digital series to be pretty hit or miss. I don't know what Wizard's of The Coast does to miss the boat so hard. But I'll first put this review into a technical and then a business sense:

What works about the game:
-Bare bones, the game launches, plays, has a GUI and from what I've seen as of February, very little bugs. It's a smooth experience to start and once you get into the interface it's an enjoyable segue into the game.
-The music as always is top notch. I have yet to see anyone lodge a complaint against the music
-Fair art direction. The cards already have art that they have on file so it's hard to say that they really go out of their way with the art on the cards. However, the 3D cutscenes don't quite match the style of the cards and come off more as a Nickelodeon spinoff of Magic; which, depending on your preference, may be a good thing.
-The deck builder that everyone's been asking for is here. People complain about it not featuring a 'search by name' function. But I truly don't care. If you can remember the picture it takes all of about two seconds. And even if you unlock all the cards, it doesn't hurt to give your other options a browse while you flip to the card you want.

What doesn't work-
Now, before I get into the blemishes, it should be said that I generally enjoy the game but a review in my book is to tell people whether or not the product is worth investing in.
-The RNG. The point of the RNG being so poor is obviously an incentive to get you to buy more and more boosters. Hopefully with your own money. An easy way to observe this is to play the story mode decks. The 'challenge' often doesn't come from having a winnable deck and being forced to outthink your opponent's cards. It's redrawing, and restarting the duel over and over and over until you get a really good hand, (Hopefully with good draws afterward) and sometimes even then, some duels I found were almost impossible to win unless the opponent suffered from several bad draws.
-The Free To Pay model. Now, as I said, I love Free to Play. That's an awesome step forward with games with a competitive environment. I'll talk more about that in a second. But the problem here is that in the competitive side of the game, there's a huge incentive put on buying better cards than everyone else. Keep buy buy buying and hope your RNG gets you better cards than the other guy. A little RNG isn't bad, it keeps things interesting. However, when the incentive is to force the player to spend money when they would rather play with skill, then it's a waste of development time as you'll be seeing diminishing returns on your usage of those features.

What's just in the middle?
Well, between good and bad there's a few things that just sort of fall by the wayside.
-The free cards you earn are not very competitive.
Grinding for better cards can be fun. However, it shouldn't be done in the multiplayer against people with better cards, or at the very least not left to RNG boosters. Not neccessarily saying that the cards offered from the story should be perfectly competitive, but at least enough (if you've completed the whole story) to be able to play against starting level duelists.
-Lack of dynamic matchmaking
As far as I can tell, there's not really any matchmaking algorithms in place to match you with people at your skill level. You seem to be matched with just whoever happens to be playing. This results often in playing against other players with much better or much worse cards than you rather than someone who offers a challenge and a fun game.
-Lack of players
I don't know how many people actually play this game. But I'm judging that not a lot do from how long it can take to matchmake. I guess many people would just rather play the hard-format card game.

Ways to fix it really simply-
1.) First fix and probably most important: specifically two modes that I think will make the game even worth installing-
-Team battle: Basically, five players on each team (5v5) or (4v4) or (3v3) duel it out with premade competitive decks (similar to picking a hero in Dota, each deck has unique themes and abilities and once picked, can't be picked by the enemy team).
This is going to be the main draw of the game. Teams can use game chat to speak to eachother, and make tactical decisions. Suddenly there's a team dynamic, and it's even better than just playing 1v1 with a friend.
-Free battles: These are the current gametypes but reworked. #2 will talk about how to improve this mode. These are duels using decks that you've assembled yourself using the cards that are in the game. However, there can be certain rules applied:
Legacy, Modern, etc.

2.)Observe functioning Free to play systems: perhaps some of the best and most marketably viable free to play models are actually on Steam. Team Fortress and Dota 2 come with their own brand of users and you take them or leave them. Magic is much the same. However to make Magic work as an online game, all the content of the game needs to be free and readily available with balancing patches to control the meta game.
The reason why this works: players can spend more time on the game getting better, and more competitive with the game. Switching the content you want to buy to cosmetic, makes the game more worth playing.

3.) By switching the focus to cosmetic, people invest more time into the game. As they invest, they spend more. I hate to say it, but Dota found the magic formula. You spend X amount of hours and as X+fun=Financial investment.
Now you may say, but that still applies to this game! However, consider that because it's also pay to win RNG, you've got to face facts and admit that you've also got, X+fun-(loss x loss conditions)=fincancial investment. The greater the amount of losses, the less likely that user is to spend money on anything in the game. Nobody except a very small handful of people with huge egos will buy boosters just to compete in a pay to win game. It's very niche. The rest of the people willing to buy are hardcore magic fans who are already likely to just buy hard copies of cards.

Ultimately Wizards is in no financial trouble. However, they are walking away from a lot of money with this particular online game. By tweaking their approach by a bit, their financial rewards could be greater.

Players however, if you are a huge Magic fan then you'll love that the game is free to play, but may grow tired of the monotonous grinding for boosters and long loss streaks in attempts to get better cards with less frustrating outcomes.
If you're not a fan of Magic, but a fan of card games looking to install one on steam, then try it out.
If you're not a fan of Magic and can take or leave a card game, then pass. There are plenty of other, (better) free to play games out there.

If the game is updated to a state where it adresses some of its core issues, then I will happily update this review. | bonjour a toute l'équipe , je me prénomme nadège je suis maman et je suis atteinte d'une maladie qui m'oblige a rester alliter et j'avoue que magic me fait passer des heures agréable et m'occupe bien ...donc pour cela je vous remercie tous ... cepentdant les petits hics de magic sont : les decs de départ devrais etre dissociés d'avec les dec d'aide constructeur pour les confirmée et j'avous que se systeme d'aide mais souvent précieux mais je retrouve souvent mes anciens jeux ....le deuxieme hic que je rencontre c'est avec les mauvais joueurs en effet quand ils n'ont pas de jeux ils font tourner le chrono jusqu'à la fin je pense que pour ce genre de technic vous devriez mettre en place un chrono dégréssif comme ca plus ils attendent sur le chrono ben le second tour leurs chrono et plus rapid ou plus cour bref voilà mes opinions je vous remercie une nouvelle fois et faite que votre jeu dure toujours car je l'adore amitié a tous .........      nadège | I recently started getting back into magic after being inactive for around 15 years. However, other than standard tournaments, I don't have many opportunities to play against other players, so I figured I needed an online version of magic to practice. Magic duels is OK to get back into the mechanics and see what other people play, but other than that, it's a HUGE disappointment:

- Insane grind. buying boosters as a poor kid in the 90ies (p2w in its pure form) was more fun.

- Stupid deck restrictions: rares 2x, uncommons 3x (to keep serious players away or p2w low?)

- Strange format: not pure standard, balance seems off ( banned smuggler's copter still being played, too many cheap removal spells...)

- Terrible connectivity: connection losses all the time, dropped players get replaced by AI and most of the time, you have to beat the AI in order to not receive a loss, alt+tab is all it takes to get disconnected, possibly lots of room for exploits. Lags are so hard that often you can't hit the stop button to react to your opponent, which defeats the whole purpose of playing magic. 

- No possibility to interact with other players: no chat, no trade, nothing. Which might be wise, because...

- The duels community equals the bottom of the magic community. You won't find many good matches, real magic fans are probablly somewhere else to be found. Often enough, playing a removal spell is all that it takes for your opponent to pull the plug and let the AI take over.... which surprisingly often leads to the AI coming back hard and winning a lost match... and then there are these assholes just waiting everytime as long as the timer allows (playing a land after waiting for 1 minute) to make YOU unpatient and disconnect, giving them a default win.

- Always playing against the same decks. Right now: red burn, topters, green ramp, sphinx tutelage. boring.

- The campaigns are a joke. The way they try to tell stories is just unworthy of the magic universe. It's nothing but still images and written dialouge, combined with a muted 90ies-style render-cutscene at the end of each campaign. And the stories are just boring. It rather ruins the unvierse for me...

- Presentation is rudimentary at best. Graphics are just the cards, a boring table, generic FX like fireballs and lightnings... even tablets could do better. There is only 1 music track playing throughout the whole game and it will drive you insane after the 2nd loop.

I honestly can't find a reason to play this other than getting a very blury first impression of what magic the gathering is and that it's probably best to stay away from it lol. Do yourself a favor and play real magic or Xmage. I honestly can't understand the people giving this a thumps up. Probably the kind of people going to McDonalds when they're hungry and liking every shit on facebook... | 为什么都要和炉石做对比，这明明就是鼻祖好么。

[h1]ACTUAL REVIEW[/h1]

I've invested a decent amount of time and more money than I care to admit in this game, so I feel its time to give it an honest review.

[u]Pros[/u]
+ Teaches you how to play MTG, So it's a good game to pick up for new players along with returning players needing a refresher.
+ Atmospheric campaigns that introduce you to each new set while also earning you coins.
+ Game limits your collection and deck to only one mythic, 2 rares, 3 uncommon, and 4 common cards of any individual card. This creates an artificial buffer and prevents players with too much money/time from building crazy decks that will dominate the metagame. 
+ Finite amount of cards for each set, meaning eventually you will have every card in the set. With older sets going on sale every so often to help build your collection more quickly.
+ 150 coin price tag is very fair for a booster of 6 cards. Winning a multiplayer match earns you 30 coins plus any bonuses for completing weekly and daily quests means you can unlock at least one new booster every day with a decent deck.
+ Every set since Origins has been included, and they continue to add new blocks as they come out, with some card exceptions that would be too complicated to code in a vs format.
+ All the fun of FNM, minus the smell.

[u]Cons[/u]
- Mana tapping system needs work, though there is a mana tapping key, often times it either doesn't work correctly or is just too clucky to use in the limited time you have to play your turn. Nothing is more frustrating than a match going sideways because the game chose to tap the wrong mana for you.
- Game is very buggy at times, I had to leave a match I was winning because the game refused to unzoom a card and blocked my view of the battlefield. Another time, the game froze on the ""opponent watching animations screen"" and it cost me the match. 
- Game has been out long enough for there to be enough ""auto include"" mythics and rares between all the sets to make it frustrating to play vs battles at times. I've run out of fingers and toes for the amount of times I've seen ""Combustable Gearhulk"" in any deck that has red in it.
- Game really favors the constructed format of the game, which can be jarring/frustrating for players that like to play limted formats like draft, sealed, and pauper. 
- Plainswalkers dominate the game. Some are pretty benign, but you'll see the frustrating ones enough to make you walk away from the game at times. (I personally haven't liked plainswalkers when they were introduced years ago, At least back then they were reasonable being 6 drops with something along the lines of ""+1: Target creature gets +1/+1"" not 4 drops with ""+3: Make game unplayable."")
- No In-game chat with other players. (I would probably get banned if we actually had this, I'm humble enough to know I can be a sore winner/loser.)
-All the frustration of FNM, minus the smell.

I really like Magic duels, but I also hate it just as much. I've lost count of how many times I've walked away from the game, never to play again, just to find myself back again in another duel 30 minutes later. I honestly think you need to be a little bit of a masochist to enjoy this game. 

If you like MTG, you'll feed that itch with this game. If you want to learn MTG, this game is a good jumping off point. If you want to stare blankly at the screen in a silent burning rage that could fuel a thousand suns, this game is for you."

Literally almost anything goes given you have the materials. Things synergize sometimes, sometimes not. The music is absolutely phenomenal, one of my favorite parts of any game is the music. If my ears are happy, I'm happy. 

The level design is alright, its kind of just going from level to level hitting stuff with whatever spell you crafted in a randomly generated level of random enemies that pertain to the area you chose with scaling hp. Lot of trial and error most times but thats part of the fun. There's no penalty for losing or anything just gotta do the level again. 

Genuinely a fun time and would recommend to anyone who likes these types of sandbox freeform go ham type games. Definitely worth 10 bucks, and heck if you are into that, I'd pick up the soundtrack as well. Just a good listen. | 게임도 참신하고 재미는 있음

It's just fun, and you can play it for 5 minutes if that's all you got, or two hours.  No negatives, just an addicting little cartoon plane game that can hook you. | One of the best underrated multiplayer games. And it's ultra low spec.
Best part of this is the football. You got football played with planes and you can't underestimate how good that is. 
5 different planes add some good depth to it. 
If you're a beginner- it's worth finding a football server with bots, and learning how to pass and all that. Also there's a good fun tutorial prepared by altitude. 
Most common server is 14 people, and sometimes the skill level can be quite high. In which case be maybe a bit prepared for some grumpy players especially if you don't know which direction you're going, don't know how to pass, and go for enormous kill counts and neglecting the ball. 
Otherwise, enjoy one of the most underrated multiplayer games on the internet, and which is free as well. | A few years ago I had a lot of fun with this game.  Not sure if it's still alive/active or whatever and I can't exactly find out since my account is just, I don't know, gone?  It's weird.

It was really fun, though.  Like a lot of games that have an overall account level, though, it wasn't the most balanced.  Later upgrades and planes were just, you know, objectively better than starting things.  The ships aren't necessarily rock-paper-scissors in design but there are elements like that to them.  Having said that, the starting ship is probably the best one, which is good for beginners.

Regardless, the ships were balanced enough that you could play whatever and probably be fine in most situations.  The game modes were varied enough.  You had death match and team death match, yeah, but there was also a mode where you destroyed an enemy base, and another where you effectively played soccor with the space ships.  I really liked the last one, but they were all fun and I'd play whatever when I did.

Controls were fine, graphics were fine, sounds were fine.  The only problem I ever encountered were some latency issues, where people would just appear to teleport somewhere else or where you were clearly disconnecting (everyone was falling or flying into walls).

Yeah, every now and then I boot this up and try to figure out my old account, or to make my old account work, but it never happens.  Had a lot of good times and I would totally play some more, if not a lot, should I ever fix that.  Good game, if you see it on sale, do check it out.  Assuming it's still alive.  It might not be!

The edit: game is mostly dead except for old elitists, apparently.  Shame.  Guess they are a pretty closed off community and not friendly to newbs.  Oh well.  RIP altitude. | A few years back, this game was great. It had a small community but enough to make the game worth playing. As of now there's probably only a few dozen people playing.

이딴 게 [우크라이나 지원 번들]도 아니고 내가 직접 골라서 결제한 게임이라니...
(75% 할인 받은 걸 다행이라고 해야되나) | TLDR: This is a good exploration game, that features 6 major boss fights. It's not terribly long, and it's chill apart from having to deal with a some clunky features in the battle system.

I enjoy this game- it's relatively chill, up until you hit the different area bosses. You can complete each area in any order, so if you want to farm all the health and ability upgrades before doing the bosses, you can. The levels are neat, with some lore spread throughout. The music and voice over are really good, and I appreciate that they decided to record the dialogue in Icelandic. The art is interesting, and I appreciate that they tried to do something unique with it- it really shines with the bosses and creatures, and some of the environments are genuinely lovely. The boss fights are fun, and the the patterns are well telegraphed- I really enjoyed the Ice Jotun, and the Sky Jotun. That doesn't keep it from being frustrating though at times. 

Your character moves slow, the arena maps are large, and the giants have long steps (as they would be expected to have). You spend a lot of time chasing the giants around the arena, for a few hits, before they move again. The god abilities are frustrating to use, as they're on a bar that you cycle through. It's distracting to go from one ability to the next, and you have to watch what ability you have selected, which draws your attention away from the boss. It's easy to overshoot the ability you want, and you can't rearrange the skills to make it easier to get to the skills you need quickly. The selection does cycle from the end , back to the beginning, but that just once again means you sometimes roll past the thing you need. It would have felt more smooth to be able to assign the abilities to key/button presses in order to make better use of muscle memory, and it's hard not to feel like a fair number of deaths are because of this clunky feature. I would use all the abilities more often, if I didn't feel like I had to be on the most helpful skills, all the time, just in case.
I've gotten Odin down to 20% of his health a few times now, and am not sure I will complete the game due to this. I may just youtube the end of the game instead, but it was still enjoyable to try the game overall.

I will say for completionists, there is one persistent bug for the Northern Sky map which does not register you collecting the Mimir check point. This bug has been in the game since at least mid 2023, and hasn't been fixed. In order to get the achievement for completion, you need to change the game file to an older build through steam, and collect it using that version of the game.
Go to ""Properties -> Betas"" and in the ""Beta participation"" drop down menu select ""oldversion - oldversion""; the save files are apparently compatible. | This game is SO SLOW.I would walk, and it would be like 10 seconds to just get across one screen in a whole area. Want to do a heavy attack? Try waiting 3 full seconds for it to strike. Want to hit a boss? You'll walk up to it in 3 seconds, and then it'll slowly pull away, making it impossible to hit, and it'll take another 5 seconds to continue walking until you can hit it.
I found the abilities to be quite useless. I only used the healing, which by the end only recovers about 1/3 of your health (with 3 uses, you can roughly fill your health bar all the way back up once), and Mjolnir, which basically shaved off a few hits during boss battles (and since each attack sequence took anywhere between 10 and 30 seconds, it was a big time-saver). But because it only worked with heavy attacks, you had to basically be on top of it where you could trigger it AND get a heavy swing in before the boss moved again, which was very rare. I don't recall wasting so many limited-use abilities as I did in this game. And I tried triggering the other abilities, which mostly didn't really do anything useful. The shield, for example—if you needed it, you were probably dead, anyway.
For some reason, I wanted to be able to recommend this game because I'm a softie for pretty indie games with worlds that bring to life cultures and myths. But, man, it was almost like they didn't respect my time with this game. I wouldn't mind walking far distances if it was scenic or I felt like things were far away, but sometimes I'd walk for a minute or two only to be staring at my character moving slowly across a nearly blank screen the whole time. | Sevmedim ilk 30 dakikada bana devam ettirme isteği oluşturacak hiç bir şey vermedi.

As much as I play other games that I really like too, I always find myself coming back to Gigantic if I just feel like I really wanna' play a good game, 'cause that's what this game is, a good game, a really good game, and it really is worth checking out, and it's free-to-play aswell, while not even beeing pay-to-win, so there really idn't a reason to not give it a go | I played this game back in alpha last year after getting a key from a streamer. I remember not being able to join friends and after a few games, I decided the game wasn't for me and just another clone.

Being bored and only seeing games with no depth in gameplay and just essentially imitating the original MOBA/FPS formula, I decided to give Gigantic another shot after it came out for Steam. I'm originally from DotA and MMORPG pvp-style games, so having a MOBA-esque theme with third-person gameplay actually fit my needs.

Some elements I definitely like about the game are the strategy involved, artstyle, animations, colorful particles. 
I mean your nexus/core actually jumps to the other side of the field to crush the enemy nexus/core? WTF. These Guardians are huge and makes you feel right there on the battlefield. Not to mention the fact that Clash mode completely changes the map.

On the surface, the game seems pretty simple. You lay minions on control points, you kill other people, and you win the game by killing the enemy boss. What you don't see are the strategic elements in the game. Some examples being:

[*]What limited creature do I summon on this point?

[*]Do I spend my focus on upgrading the creature to an adult or keep it so I can use my ultimate?

[*]One of the Guardians (Boss) is going on a rampage, do I defend/attack the Guardian or do I attack a control point to put more points into the next round?

Then you add on to the defending, healing, sprinting, dodging, engaging, killing, wounding fast-paced part of the game, it becomes quite immersive. Seriously, this game is [b]fast-paced AF[/b] (game time and movement speed). I don't think I've played a game as fast as this. You sprint literally everywhere.

Anyway, back on topic. Motiga isn't a big company, but they seem to be on track with feedback and updates. 
Whether this game gets popular in the future, I definitely plan to stick with this game. A game formula that I actually enjoy with amazing art is rare for me.

I mean this game is F2P. Give it a shot and try it out for yourself and mold your own thoughts. What do you have to lose?"

Самое то, если хочется поиграть партию вечер-два, проиграть, отдохнуть и вернуться снова. | I'm pretty sure the developer of this game enjoys the suffering of others. Basically, we have what appears to be on the surface a unique and interesting take on settlement survival with some wave/tower defense thrown in. However after trying and failing to keep one village alive for even 2 seasons, I have the absolute opinion that what this game really is, is a thinly veiled gacha game in which, even if you do everything right, build everything in the perfect order, place all the buildings in the perfect spots, you still will likely lose because A: you haven't suffered enough to open enough ""god experience"" chests to boost enough stats, and B: the 'random' events seem to absolutely favor causing you the most suffering possible. 

There's not nearly enough margin for the player to express any level of experimentation or creativity in building or defending. Basically, if you don't do everything just right - you doom yourself - often many days before you are even aware of it. Then you get to decide if you are going to spend the next hour slowly watching your village burn away because there's no possible recovery metric. The enemy just grows at a stupidly fast rate and you just die. That's it. That's the game. Personally, I'd rather go walk barefoot across a field of legos. | This game does not work.  I can't stress this enough.  If you go into skirmish it does not function the way it supposed to and you can't do anything.

76561197999259031,333930,Dirty Bomb®,6.216666666666667,"Action, Free To Play",12,"Lets dismiss the rumor that this game is Pay 2 Win, it actually isn't anywhere close to it. If you were to personally ask me what P2W is, I'd say, ""Games with weapons or unlockables (Generally ones that give you an advantage or are just overpowered) not obtainable through playing the game for free, instead using real world money to unlock it.""

TL;DR: Everything above Bronze in loadouts is cosmetic. Characters rotate to play for free every week.

How this game works is entirely different, you get loadout cards, now while you might think, ""Oh, well that must mean that everything Silver and Gold is better than things that are Bronze."" This is not correct, every card above Bronze simply works as a form of cosmetic.
On the other hand you have people that would say, ""Getting a Bronze card would mean you have way too many advantages over players that don't."" This is also not true, as the bronze cards simply give you perks on the side that give you small boosts, no gun damage, health (Except for one perk that gives you up to 30 health for dying multiple times) or other character attributes altered with cards.

Now with these loadout cards, you also get different weapons. These weapons on the loadout cards will change how you play your character. By default you have good loadouts, you can destroy anybody with the basic loadouts so long as you can aim, your guns make you, not your perks. You can get a different gun for every rarity of loadout, even the worst rarities come with guns that can change how you play by alot, but for the most part all the guns are reletively balanced.

Next comes the whole RNG thing that people get very angry at because they can't find good things in cases. 1000 ingame credits = 1 case, this case grants you 1 random loadout card in the game, with the higher tier rarities being lower chances of obtaining, but still possible. if you really want to go all out, you can spend 5 dollars in real world money for some random cases that are primarily used for the higher chance at getting Gold and Cobalt loadouts, but still guarenteed a Silver loadout.

The crafting system is next and it's pretty simple, put in cards you don't like of the same rarity and get the next loadout rarity up, you also select any of the characters that you want a loadout specifically for. Essentially trade up contracts in CS:GO. Pretty easy to understand, gives you another chance at randomizing and it's a way of letting you get loadouts that are Silver and higher without the RNG chance, however the weapons and perks are randomized each time. 
With that being said, if you find that you can't be bothered to open up cases for 1000 ingame credits, you can simply save up enough to just buy a bronze loadout that you like.

Next comes characters. Here's where people have whined most about the game. ""6-10 Dollars for a single character in this game? What a ripoff!"" And here's where I come in and say ""You don't need to spend money, blah blah blah, you can play the game normally and get every character you just need to save up a bit.""
On top of this, there is a free character rotation every week. Just like in League of Legends, every week three characters become unlocked for the week's duration as playable characters, afterwards you need to purchase them to keep them permanently.

To end this I'm simply going to put it. The game is fun, not Pay 2 Win, and it's starting to take up time I would spend playing Tf2. | Most fun I've had with an FPS in a long time. Pretty fast-paced combat, classes aren't too gimmicky. Anyone who digs Enemy Territory or thought Brink had a ton of potential should definitely check it out | I find DB has drifted from what I would want in a game to something I don't like. More importantly, I don't think it will improve enough to enjoy going forward, so I'm going to uninstall DB.

The fundamental reason I'm going to uninstall is that the initial and early characters didn't feel too gimmicky, and they tended to work together. Since that time, they've become more and more ridiculous. Constantly putting in characters that don't really mesh together isn't helping the team aspect of the game. When you can help your team while still shooting the enemy and not need to make a decision about which to do, you have a problem. Throwing health packs, ammo, and needing to be on top of people to revive them encourages smart team play. ""Don't run into the open, we can't pick you up"" Sparks the medic comes out, and more fools over-extend because you can revive them now at a distance, instead of them being dead and gibbed, and they can be picked up. Not being revived is the game punishing bad play by those who over-extend. Javelin dispenses ammo even in fire-fights, so who needs to manage and plan for their ammo? Getting into long fire-fights back in 2015 used to require someone to be very good at managing ammo and position. You had to bring a support character, but that person needed excellent positioning to be able to toss that pack and hit a teammate who needs it without giving it to the enemy, and then quickly be back in the fight. The same is true of the medics. Running a combo of medic/ammo giver required great support. Automatically dispensing ammo in a circle around you doesn't force you to think about how to help your team, and you can help without actively helping. You can both help you team with a power, and shoot an enemy. This isn't encouraging teammates to help each other, it just encourages them to bunch up. Further, key abilities can be done by everyone, like repairing, planting explosives, and reviving. This dilutes the need to take certain classes at all.

Further, rarely has a new character been balanced on release, which means in the the intervening time between release and patch you face a lot of people playing a broken character. In-fact, new characters were never allowed straight into ranked. They would hold them back because they knew they weren't balanced. They eventually gets nerfed, frequently too far, and the cycle repeats. This is irritating, but I also know that characters aren't balanced until you really get a lot of people playing them. I don't know why they feel so far off each time, but I suspect it is because of the aforementioned decision to keep pushing out characters that have odd abilities that need to be special to justify making a new merc. Balancing among more and more abilities also takes more and more effort - effort that could be spent making the one thing that doesn't get enough attention - maps.

Maps. You need more maps. You always need more maps. More maps means more unique strategies, it means you can play a lot of matches without repeating maps (back when there were only 6 maps, I took lots of several week or several month breaks because I didn't want to play the same maps over and over). Each map should highlight a few abilities. You can get the objective done without them and successfully defend without them, but on some maps, some characters should shine without being overpowered. Each map should be able to take advantage of each merc's abilities. I know this is a tall order, but you want to be great, right? The more abilities you have, the more trouble you have where you get into a map and think, ""I brought a terrible merc for this map."" That should not happen, ever. Rhino is a good example. There are some maps where I will never take him, he's far too slow, and he needs to be on top of people to do damage. There are too many maps where he cannot do much, and very few maps where he can truly shine. Similarly, taking Skyhammer or Arty in Underground, is a waste of time (Skyhammer's marker does act like a grenade, but it isn't a great one). Stoker, on the other hand, dominates in Undergound because his ability is always useful. There is no need for that enormous discrepancy between characters. This removes flexibility to form and break defenses. 

While this is definitely a personal preference, the worst part about this game is being one-shot. I don't know why people think this is fun in an arcade-style shooter. In ARMA, SWAT, Rainbow 6, being one-shot killed is fine and I like those games, but not in a game like this. It wasn't fun 20 years ago with the rocket launchers in Quake and Unreal, it still isn't now. The wide-spread availabilty and ease-of-use of one-shot weapons in this game is killing my enjoyment (and I realize that this is a very personal complaint, hence the reason I listed it last). The fact that most people cannot use one-shot weapons well in a fast-moving arcade-style shooter doesn't make them balanced. In any game, when you balance to the average, you neglect that part of the population who will take the time needed to perfect the one-shot (or power, skill, etc.) who will still continue to dominate with over-powered weapons/abiliites, etc. This is where the accurate arcade-style shooting and movement work against you - perfecting that one-shot is 100% doable. I've met and seen plenty of people who have perfected it. For awhile, I could do it pretty well, but it felt really cheap and dirty, so I stopped. Once you master the one-shot kill, it's a joke for those who don't. Removing scope sway on snipers - terrible move, the sway at least made the one-shot kills reasonably rare but threatening. The reviver railgun of doom - terrible move. I still stuck around, despite really not liking these changes. The additional of Javelin was another change that I didn't like. What purpose does she serve? There are characters who can break-up camps, if they're not doing the job, adjust them! Instead, you put in the one-shot rocket of doom, something I was really proud of you for not putting in the game from day one. An arcade style game balanced without a rocket launcher. Ponder that. We had that.

Coming back after a long break, I wanted to see how the game progressed. I see the new characters introduced, and one of them is Hunter - he has a crossbow that can one-shot people. After playing a few games against people with Hunter, I can see once again that the higher-skilled players are STILL taking the high-damage sniper rifles, and Hunter. I used to accept being one-shot as part of the game, but I just don't want to deal with it anymore. If I want to be killed in one shot while moving around a corner, I'll play the SWAT and Rainbow 6 games - realistic shooters. Not in arcade shooters. I want teamwork, but that can't be had, because not enough abilities force you to support or rely your team. I used to think that the self-healing that all mercs have was fine, but as time went on, I found myself drawn to characters that had ""tough"" perk because I didn't need a medic. Ammo is easy to come by, generally, and rarely do you need to go far out of the way to get it, so who needs those pesky teammates? Going to get ammo shouldn't be easy, a team game should prefer you to get it from teammates, and hence punish you by having inconvenient ammo supply locations.

In case you are wondering, I don't play Overwatch. I saw enough in the videos to know that it wasn't what I was looking for. And now, very sadly, I must conclude that Dirty Bomb joins it.

Finally, I apologize for mistakes - I edited this heavily to make sure my thoughts were coordinated, but I suspect there are errors still left. | Back in 2003, Splash Damage released a standalone freeware game known as Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.  It combined the speed and movement of Quake and the hitscan and aiming mechanics of Counter-Strike into a objective-based game.  The focus on team-oriented objectives created a very popular fps game that sadly had a community die off and move on.

Splash Damage attempted to revive the series with with Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, but was largely unsucessful.

Welcome to Dirty Bomb, the newest reincarnation of the gameplay.  It feels and plays like the first legitemate sucessor to Enemy Territory.  With similar team-based classes, and a much more noob-friendly interface than ET could ever muster, this game could possibly be the first game that is a legitemate competitor to CSGO in terms of competitive FPS games... as long as Nexon doesn't FUCK everything up and make the game p2w.

The shooting mechanics combine that of quake and counter-strike.  Players are tanky and can take 2 or 3 headshots to kill.  However, similar to CS, aiming for the head is highly rewarding as most guns will kill in 8 to 10 shots (generally it takes a little less than 2 seconds to kill a player with body shots).  Additionally, you're highly accurate while moving, which makes strafe shooting a viable and effective strategy.

Don't let the cartoonish atmosphere fool you, however.  Despite its simplistic nature, there is a lot of depth to the game in taking fights, healing with medics, and even intentionally suiciding to respawn with full ammo or to defend an objective.

If you like playing competitive FPS games, give this one a fair shot.  The gameplay is quite unforgiving for new players, but highly rewarding if you stick with it. | By far my favorite FPS game on PC and one of the best i've played ever, with the added plus that it is FREEE! While it is not pay to win, it definitly requires skill and somewhat good reaction speed. It is incredibly fast paced, with battles happening across the various maps. It has a selection of 20 different mercs, with an array of abilities that include but not limited to land mines, airstrikes,and revive guns. It's devs pay close attention to their fan base and always try to respond, while keeping them up to date with every new piece added to the game. All in all, the best PC game I have played yet and it receives the highest recommendations I can give. A game worth playing :D

edit:they have added even more characters and weapons,
and I want my nomination task finished. Play Dirty!

76561197999259031,334920,Zero-K,13.1,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy, Free To Play",0,"I've gotten over 500 hours so maybe its review time.  An excellent game in the Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander style.  Entirely open source code written by volunteers, in family with Beyond All Reason.  While it inherits a lot from this gene pool, it provides a very good re-imagination of several core concepts.

I was a skeptic when I first came over Zero-K on Steam, and my first game was just weird feeling.  Its a bit more zoomed-in and less-serious feeling, but delivers (in particular) really interesting large multiplayer battles.  Now when I try one of the more classic games mentioned above, I miss the options Zero-K gives.

It can take a while to understand the different factories and units within; not all factories have the answer to all problems, and not all units fit into some nice category.  Map control is a big deal.  Terraform and shields allow the construction of pretty impressive forts, while cloak fields keep the enemy guessing.

Water units could be better, one of the superunits ought to be changed (I think).  Overall though, excellent game. | this is like TA and thats is a GOOD thing!! 
very good game
and people who not a tech/number person will just not understand just how good, im in love just love them numbers!! | Zero-K (""ZK"") is an open-source real time strategy game based on the Spring engine.
That engine has been around for over 15 years and it shows: While the graphics may not be state of the art any more, the other technical aspects of the game are very mature.
Spring based games tend(ed) to be oriented at the 1990s classic ""Total Annihilation"" (""TA"") but ZK has come a long way: The devs have streamlined the mod so that every unit and building has its own role and mechanics: There are units that cloak, stun, disarm, jump, incinerate, push or pull, climb walls... and lots more.
Units are organised into different factories, each of which represents a certain theme or gameplay focus:
Rovers are quick in flat terrain but fragile, tanks are the robust but more expensive option for the plains, there are aircraft to bomb high value targets and shield the team from air attacks and there is a gunship factory for providing close air support to ground units. There are bots with cloaked snipers and stealthy melee assassins, heavier shield bots, amphibious bots, jumping bots for taking strategic hills and closing in quickly to the enemy and there are spiders for mountain warfare. Also hovercraft and ships have their own factory.
Sounds a lot? Yet, the game is relatively easy to learn (but hard to master) as every factory has only the units required for the classic roles on the battlefield (raider, skirmisher, riots, artillery, assault) and a few specialists for the factory-specific gameplay. Most factories can do most things in principle but every on is best suited for a specific purpose.
As in original TA there are the two resources metal and energy where metal is extracted from spots on the map that thus mark strategic important positions and energy is created by specific buildings. Unlike original TA there are no buildings to generate metal from energy but instead excess energy is used to ""overdrive"" metal extractors with decreasing returns. Thus one cannot simply sit back in one's own base and build defense. A good economy requires to conquer the metal spots on the map!
Every player starts with a single (unique) commander as the first construction unit and can instantly build a free factory of her choice. There are no technology levels as in original TA or other games. Instead ""higher tier"" units and buildings simply cost more. This design choice makes the game very fast and dynamic to play and allows for a vast magnitude of strategies as players can cooperate to rush more expensive units and (hopefully) gain a surprise advantage by those unit's special capabilities.
In addition to the standard factories there is also a strider-hub for very expensive super units and there are game-ending super-weapons to break ties.
The game features ranked competitive  matchmaking in 1v1 or small teams (but currently only 1v1 has a decent player base). There are also casual games, typically played in larger teams up to 16v16, FFA games, coop games vs AI or special aliens (""chickens""). The AI can be surprisingly strong and give this game a viable singleplayer option.
A specialty are widgets written in LUA which can automate a lot of the tedious click-work found in other rts games. Many widgets come with the base game and others can be downloaded for free. For example there are skirmish AIs which let artillery retreat from raiders and push when they are free to advance. Writing ones own widgets is not considered cheating and there is a variety of community-made ""helper scripts"" available. (Note that it is usually expected to publish the  self-written widgets for everyone.)
With the default skirmish AIs and other widgets, players can focus on strategic thinking and tactical nuances and need not indulge in rapid clicking only to manage default tasks as is often the case in other RTS games such as Starcraft.
I have been playing Spring based games since 2006 and ZK since 2011 (with a long pause), before it came to Steam. A decade of continuous development has resulted in a very polished game which is surprisingly well-balanced given its complexity and unique innovative features. Certainly a must-try for RTS-lovers. | Fun with some light strategy."

       Transformice...what can I say about it... Well, you are a mouse. Which isn't that great, but the real amazing thing is that you chase after cheese all day.  Literally my biggest dream that I never told anyone. Some may make fun of me for the amount of time I played, but I say if I could chase after cheese in real life I would spend more than a few couple hundred hours on it. You know what makes it even better? It's free! Free Cheese! And you know everything free tastes better. It's hard for new people to like it because it's pretty difficult to be able to even get the cheese in the first place, but once you get that cheese, everything changes. You just want to get that cheese again and again. Life is going good; all the cheese you can get your little grubby little paws on. Then BOOM, it hits you, you realize it, you finally realize that the cheese you love is full of MSG and you can't stop even if you wanted to... It all spirals out of control at this point. Am I a mouse or human??? I don't even know anymore. I need to go get some more cheese. Yes, cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE!!!

It used to be a tradition for me to play [i]Life is Strange[/i] every New Year’s Eve when visiting my childhood home. So many memories intertwine with it. Jumping up and down on the bed losing my mind after the 3Ep twist. Bugging my classmates with a basket of theories and insane lore about the game's development. Cutting my hair slowly bit by bit until it eventually resembled Max's. I learned Spanish Sahara by heart and played it non-stop on the ukulele I begged my parents to buy. Even the wall of my room was decorated in Max's style – a tradition I carry to all the homes, or the resemblance of homes, I've changed along the way. In 11th grade, I made Max’s journal from scratch, it was one of my favorite pieces in the room, taking a notable place among my own personal and school diaries. I remember playing the 4th episode on a school week until 6am and going straight to school all hyped and simultaneously out of it. When Episode 5 came out, I sobbed for two weeks! My best friend at that time and I woke up so early that day, purposefully missed school, and spent all day immersed in that final chapter – her watching a live stream and I cursing at my old computer unable to handle Max’s time jumping shenanigans; of course, taking occasional breaks for comparing our declining emotional stability. [i]Life is Strange[/i] carried me from that final school year straight to University, helping me figure out some stuff about my own life along the way; as it did to many. Every time I turn it on now it just turns into a crying fest. From love, of course. But also sorrow.

Over the years, I’ve read so many players' intimate recollections prompted by the game's content; random snippets of people’s most vulnerable life stories sprinkled over each social media platform. Simply something awoken in people of all ages and backgrounds, perhaps by the game’s mellow nostalgic aesthetics and unabashed willingness to attune to the finest memories and emotions of our hearts. It was rather pleasant to witness the resurgence of [i]LiS[/i] fandom in late 2024, collectively reminiscing on our intimate interaction with the story, the newfound change in perspectives, and the passionate desire to mutually share all the warmth we still have for its characters. 

Living through Max was foundational for me, a self-conscious girl growing into confident adulthood with innocence violently ripped away from her. It was simply an average coming-of-age process, growing up and seeing a world from a different perspective, learning to connect and empathize with those around, learning from them and finding our own flaws and desires, recognizing them and growing to be better. But also a darker experience of going through my own sexual assault, of losing my own innocence, shifting and modifying the self to perhaps be more cynical and pragmatic, of maybe seeing the world through a darker yet necessary lens. Yet, ultimately, all of it forming one unified identity that is nevertheless a beautiful landscape of variable experiences and lessons; adulthood. I will always love the character of Max dearly. I will always cry noticing the gradual change of her vibrant diary doodles to objective, subdued in color entries with each passing chapter. I will always cry for the innocent love Max finds in non-innocent circumstances. The exploration of Max’s fractured mind following the violation will always mean the world to me, back in 2015 making me feel seen and motivated to start my own tumultuous journey of healing. I will always be grateful for Don’t Nod creating this beloved gamified companion to project our own internal worries onto, our transformations, and dreams; to reach intimate answers through a bittersweet, meditative experience.

[i]Life is Strange[/i] maintains sheer gratitude and wonder for each part of our environment while not rejecting the truth of the shadows stretching over the world’s corners. Finding beauty in the industrial powers of small towns, their nature, expansion in infrastructure, transformation of beliefs, unique differing people, and their interconnected messy ties to each other: as colleagues, students, friends, lovers. Finding beauty in the contrast of lives cut short, resentments, domestic disputes, destructive truths, violence, and uncertainty of tomorrow. Creating a living, breathing town that wishes to continuously evolve, grow, and adapt to the changing population making up its geographical landscape. Rachel Amber’s character is perhaps the most compassionate interpretation of Laura Palmer’s image I have seen, Chloe’s uncensored journey of clawing through grief calls to the most helpless moments of my own 19old self, and the understanding of violence captured in a human-shaped form still wounds me deeply: of course, so much of [i]LiS[/i] was inspired by and carried love for David Lynch’s legacy.


It's not so much the content of media; over time it becomes something bigger than its key narrative points. Rather, the events it accompanied in life, the memories you associate it with. That's when stories become truly dear to the heart no matter the years passed. It simply evokes a subdued feeling, like a thread granting the privilege to time travel to your own thoughts, memories, tastes, smells, relationships, places.

I tried replaying this game in so many locations now it can be drawn onto a map, like a shi+ty road trip. But I never lasted very long, about 30 minutes before I lose my cool completely and start thinking of the hand-drawn picturesque walls of my school. Of the captured memories sprinkled over my walls. Of the path to my home from school, from my friends, from the center, from my mom's job, from the park, from the waterfront. Of the last school days and giving away my books. Of getting closer with my classmates and finally understanding how similar we are. Of looking out my window, the windows of my friends, the windows of my school – and seeing sunsets, sunrises, golden hours, whirlwinds, blizzards, screeching hot days. Of dark days. Of town spots I avoid. Of town spots I wish could stay with me. A living breathing town… trapped in hazy, fleeting pieces of memory. Out of reach, a resemblance of something that used to be, overwritten by new places and people – when it's one of the last anchors you have to that past you cannot go back to. Learning to hold the value of delicate memory, accept darkness, and cherish its lighter undertones.

Finally replaying the game after these years, I’ve been finding new connections with Arcadia Bay, of the radical shift it makes from a nostalgic warm town to a harbor of ruin. How it strongly encompasses both, yet neither. I’ve been thinking of how the geography of my town has been modified, its prior identity forever wiped away. I’ve been countering the grief of losing childhood physically and emotionally with the fleeting traces of glee that used to be. On dark days, I will always hold on to the memory of sitting on the hot-to-the-touch boulder stone with my childhood friend, giggling about our new life developments, surrounded by forestry of a quiet park and bright sun. Of looking around me and seeing kids become more expressive in their identities, unafraid to look, think, and love however they please. Of regularly visiting my school and checking in to see if the asphalt drawing we made in dedication to our class teacher has faded away, or the chamomiles covering the school’s entrance are still greeting the children. Of peaking outside from the large plants covering my mom’s windowsill and seeing the rose we have planted outside slowly rise and bloom. Of always having a prepared 2h15m playlist to accompany me on the trip to my town from the nearby big city.

Nowadays, [i]Life is Strange[/i] transports me to the hot summer days of my home. 
I will always be grateful for having a chance to time travel. | Absolutely incredible story. 10/10
Also runs on a potato so that's nice. | I've been wondering for a long time whether ""Life is Strange"" is a game I could recommend or not, since it has very positive reviews and a slew of fans. I also expected such an experience. Unfortunately, I have to admit that the game disappointed me. Don't get me wrong, I fell in love with the demo version (chapter one), which promised an elaborate crime story with several suspects and lots of decision-making. We were introduced to the characters along with our heroine (Max), as she was new to the school. It promised a story full of excitement, mystery and consequences of our choices.

Unfortunately, after purchasing the full version of the game, with all the chapters (21 hours played), the spell faded in several different ways:

1. The game turned out to be a delusion of the consequences of the choices (except for the final decision at the end - although this one is disappointing in terms of the logic of the choice and the realization of the consequences, especially in the case of one final).
 
2. The game deliberately distracts us from some characters, completely forgetting them as criminal suspects. Because of this, we are unable to gather evidence in their case. Which is then supposed to cause surprise, shock, etc. - A cheap, ineffective ploy.

3. Overly cinematic final chapters. At one point in the game, there was so much story told in interludes and stills that for most of the chapter, the player had nothing to do but minor linear activities that contributed nothing. This killed my immersion and and even more my sense of control and decision-making.

4. Little bugs. The ending cutscenes have a number of close-ups of characters talking without their mouths moving. There are so many of them that at some point it becomes uncomfortable. The time reversal system is also sometimes unintuitive and can erase a decision even though it was not intended.

**[Warning: little spoilers]**

5. Final decisions: It is supposed to arouse emotions, but whether it does so is not necessarily the case. The first ending looks good and emotional, but the second one is dull and bland. In addition, it shows that everything we did throughout the game is irrelevant to our protagonist Max (all the friendships we've made, the lives we saved, etc.). That's not how you write good endings.

6. Imbalance in the characterization of the characters. Just as most of the characters are good written (they have their own motives, secrets, behaviors and are believable), I cannot say the same about two of the main characters who should arouse sympathy - Chloe and (maybe) Warren.
The friendship between Max and Chloe is, in my opinion, completely one-sided. Chloe uses Max's skills like a toy, she doesn't accept criticism, she's explosive and I didn't get the impression that she actually cared about her friend or even respected her, her character and way of being. Thus, he forces her to engage in various activities, even though Max points out that such activities are not to her liking or even can hurt her. Despite this, Max keeps repeating wonderful words about lifelong friendship and can also create a love bond with her. The only positive aspect of Chloe's character is at the end, when she realizes all these elements and talks about them, and makes her first unselfish decision.
As for Warren, he's written strangely. He's supposed to be a geek with a crush on Max, and he basically is, but throughout the entire game I had the impression that there was something strange about him and that he was hiding something. | [i]Life is Strange[/i] is a game that focuses on realistic storytelling. The voice acting is impeccable, which is impressive because there are some very emotional scenes, the motion-captured animations are on point, and environments look like someone's drawing of real locations. Even though a large part of the soundtrack consists of licensed songs, it fits perfectly with the place and mood of the story. it's almost like the songs were written for this game. Every character, even side characters, is so real, it's impossible to not feel anything for them.

[i]Life is Strange[/i] isn't a game you just play, it's a highly traumatic life experience you go through. You don't come out the same person afterwards. It's one of those games that makes you interrogate your own decisions in life.

And I want to add that the nightmare scene was one of the coolest horror experience I've ever had, and it managed to do that without using jump scares or other cheap things like hazy environments. And I'm someone who doesn't like horror.

Personal opinion just to show how BAD everything is with this game, let's compare to something as close as possible.
Wurm online blows this out of the water and it's 18 years old coming up on 19 and if i looked at Wurm's numbers from 2024, on black friday alone, they were up 31% from 2023, up for a 2nd year straight. if that's not enough then straight from their holding company which is publicly available to look at:               
22% increase in active players
7% increase in premium players
21% Increase in daily logins

what'ts this game's excuse anymore? because lets be honest its been a lot of excuses from all of the devs over the times both old and new devs in-fact.
did actual new features, game AND server issues plus bug abuse/exploit abuse support setup, Then actually putting TRUE quality of life fixes and BUG FIXES into this technological dumpster that impacts core gameplay and more cross anyone else's mind other than the one guy in the meeting that likely got yeeted out of a window because he suggested lets make it actually playable first??? | nope I will not buy this game again yal got enough of my money with last two just like it. they will probably abandon this one after a while and shut it down too | Wrested from the hands of the original developers and relaunched by the publisher.

Когда разработчики ARK: Survival Evolved решили вписаться в жанр королевских битв, казалось, что идея неплохая: битвы с динозаврами, приручение прямо в бою, выживание против других игроков – всё это могло бы стать чем-то уникальным. Но реальность оказалась печальнее.

[h2] ✅ Что в игре хорошего: [/h2]
✔ В теории – интересная концепция (если закрыть глаза на исполнение).
✔ Динозавры в королевской битве – звучит круто, но только звучит.

[h2] ❌ Почему в это никто не играет: [/h2]
✖ Мёртвая с момента выхода – онлайн просто нет, даже боты бы не стали заходить в эту игру.
✖ Кривой баланс – если ты не оседлал Т-Рекса в первые минуты, то готовься стать кормом для тех, кто успел.
✖ Отвратительная оптимизация – просадки FPS, лаги, баги, как будто движок и сам не хочет, чтобы эта игра существовала.
✖ Никому не нужна – на фоне других королевских битв вроде PUBG, Apex Legends или даже фанатских серверов в оригинальном ARK эта игра просто не имеет смысла.

Это не просто провал – это игра, которая умерла ещё до того, как кто-то всерьёз в неё поверил разработчик. С таким же успехом можно попробовать сыграть в PUBG на выключенном мониторе – хотя бы нервы целее будут.

2 из 10 покинутых серверов. | ARK: The Survival of the Fittest is the ultimate test of survival where it’s not just about fighting dinosaurs—it’s about surviving in a world where everything, from the weather to the creatures to your fellow players, is out to get you. Picture this: you’re dropped into an island with nothing but your wits, some rocks, and a stick, and you’ve got to figure out how to stay alive while dodging massive carnivores and attempting to avoid becoming someone else’s dinner. Add in some players who think they’re the island’s top predator (spoiler: they’re not), and suddenly, your quest to survive turns into an all-out, hilarious game of “who can mess with who first?” Trust me, it’s intense, but also surprisingly fun when you realize you’re a second away from being eaten by a T-Rex and you somehow make it out alive. That’s when the real fun begins!

At its heart, ARK: The Survival of the Fittest is a battle royale-style game set in a prehistoric world, filled with dangers both natural and player-made. The basic premise? You, along with other players, are dropped onto a hostile island where you must gather resources, craft weapons, tame dinosaurs, and try to survive long enough to become the last one standing. The twist? You’ll need to strategize, team up, or even betray others to outsmart and outlast the competition. It’s not just about surviving the creatures; it’s about surviving the players too. Tame some raptors, build traps, create defenses, and get ready for combat because the last survivor on the island wins. Oh, and don’t forget about the giant mutant spiders and those terrifying, unkillable bosses roaming around. In short, everything wants you dead, and you have to be smarter, stronger, and faster to avoid becoming dinner.

What really stands out about ARK: The Survival of the Fittest is the blend of survival mechanics, strategy, and chaotic multiplayer action. The vast array of creatures you can tame and use in combat adds layers of complexity to the gameplay. The game rewards strategic thinking, from deciding when to team up with others (and when to stab them in the back) to figuring out the best way to hunt or avoid the island’s mega-predators. The crafting system is deep, and the thrill of gathering materials to build your base and weapons while fending off enemy tribes is incredibly satisfying. If you’re into survival games with a high stakes, high tension environment where every decision counts—and where a single mistake could lead to an epic failure—ARK: The Survival of the Fittest is a must-try. It’s perfect for anyone who loves a challenge, epic dino battles, and the thrill of outlasting other players in a hostile environment. Trust me, it’s chaos—and it’s absolutely worth diving into! | sera que volverán los servidores alguna vez??? | Игра просто бомба от слова совсем!

[b]Objective:[/b] Take and hold points on the map, each round you control them they contribute points towards a victory total. First to the victory total for that map wins.

[b]Impressions:[/b] I played a few total hours. Got to level 7. Played against the AI. Some UI/control complaints but nothing you can't get used to. The full 3D Isometric view and animated units are neat looking, but I don't feel like the 3D adds to the gameplay more than it gets in the way of seeing everything you might want to sometimes. Definitely more board game than CCG. You draw random cards from your deck, but there's not really combo elements or much in the way of variability. I have a feeling if I went in to play multiplayer I would run into people with some essentially unbeatable card sequences. There's not much here right now, it's fairly basic for a CCG or a board based tactics game. It's not exactly exciting to me, but I also don't feel like I was cheated by buying the game. I got something from it, even if it's just ideas about how games like this can work and some do's and don'ts.

[b]Boardgame players:[/b] Recommend if you like tactics games with random elements.

끊임없이 추락하며 적을 밟거나 터트리고, 젬을 모아 능력을 강화하는 단순하면서도 중독성 강한 게임입니다.

이 게임은 단순히 아래로 내려가기만 하면 되는 게임입니다. 다만, 내려가는 길이 결코 순탄치 않다는 게 문제죠. 플레이어가 할 수 있는 것은 이동과 점프(총)뿐입니다. 계속해서 아래로 내려가면서 몬스터의 머리를 밟거나 터트리고, 젬을 모아 무기를 업그레이드한 뒤 다시 아래로 내려가는 방식입니다.

스테이지는 총 4개로 구성되어 있으며, 마지막 스테이지에서는 보스전이 펼쳐집니다. 사실 단순히 내려가기만 하면 된다고 했지만, 마지막 보스를 상대하려면 어느 정도 업그레이드를 해두는 것이 정신 건강에 좋습니다. 플레이 도중 얻는 젬을 활용해 공격 횟수를 증가시키거나 체력을 회복하고 강화할 수 있습니다. 또한, 스테이지가 끝날 때마다 새로운 능력을 하나씩 선택할 수 있습니다.

게임의 그래픽과 색감은 다소 단조롭지만, 빠른 속도감과 뛰어난 타격감, 훌륭한 사운드가 이를 보완합니다. 공중에서 떨어지는 짧은 순간 동안 최적의 플레이를 고민하고 실행해야 하는, 단순하면서도 어렵고 그만큼 재미있는 게임이었습니다.

참고로, 이런 세로구조 게임은 모바일 환경에 더 적합하다고 생각할 수도 있지만, 사실 이 게임은 스팀 출시 이전에 이미 모바일로 먼저 나온 작품입니다. 저도 예전에 모바일 버전으로 즐겼던 기억이 있어서 그때 스팀에서 구매해두고 묵혀둔거였는데, 다시 찾아보니 현재 모바일 버전은 유료로 바뀌었네요. 예전에는 무료였던 것 같은데 말이죠. | 3.75个币的街机小游戏

Щоб ворогів знищити, потрібно або застрибнути на них, або пристрілити (стріляємо вниз ногами). На деяких ворогів не можна застрибнути, що дратує.

На рівнях можна змінити зброю на якусь іншу випадкову. Між рівнями отримуємо перки. 

Це гра для тих, хто любить високу складність, і у кого багато часу. Мета-гри (глобальної прокачки) нема. На високій швидкості тяжко летіти, бо потрібно зважати на монстрів, яких стрибком не уб'єш (а вони тебе пошкодять). Кожне проходження сприймається так само, як і попереднє. Потрібно довго розвивати свій скіл, щоб навчитися проходити глибше, але в інших іграх цей скіл не знадобиться, і його не цікаво розвивати.

Simple, right?

The difficulty (and main draw) of this game stems from the amazing combo system which allows you to rack up bonuses the more enemies you kill without touching the ground. With limited ammo this might seem really problematic, but ammo is refilled upon jumping on an enemies head. This leaves the player the choice of either going for a riskier play to jump on an enemy (and risk getting hit by something else) or just burst them down and be on their merry way. I myself have gotten hit because I spent too much time bouncing on enemies that I didn't notice I was getting chased by a skull above me.

Add in the many types of guns and the various gameplay altering upgrades Welltaro can obtain and you have yourself somewhat of an ""anti-platformer"" where you have to try and AVOID the ground to make the most of your time. 

There's also plenty replay value since hard mode gets unlocked when you beat the game for the first time. There's also color palletes and different characters to choose from that alter gameplay in some way.

Overall, would recommend everybody to at least try this wonderful classic, especially since it's only 3 bucks."

Hollow Knight is a game that truly embodies the spirit of adventure and discovery. Its [b]smooth and non-linear gameplay[/b] offers players the freedom to explore at their own pace, uncovering multiple side-quests and hidden paths.

Kısaca “Metroidvania” olarak tanımlanan bu oyun türünde, birbiri içine geçmiş küçük haritaların oluşturduğu devasa bir oyun alanı bulunur. Oyuna başladığınızda pek çok noktaya ulaşamadığınızı fark edersiniz ve oyunda ilerledikçe edindiğiniz özellikler sayesinde geri dönüp bu noktalara erişebilir hale gelirsiniz. Birbirinden alakasız görünen sayısız lokasyon kısa yollarla birleşir, bazen final noktasının başlangıç yerinden iki adım ötede karşımıza çıktığı bile olur. İşte Hollow Knight, bu iki nevi şahsına münhasır oyun türünü tek bir potada birleştiren ve bunu da kusursuz bir şekilde yapan bir oyun.

Hollow Knight giden kimsenin geri dönmediği, bünyesinde sayısız gizem barındıran topraklarda geçen bir böcek oyunu. Evet, kulağa saçma geldiğinin farkındayım ancak ön yargılarınızın sizi ele geçirmesine izin vermeyin. Zira en ufak ayrıntısına kadar ince ince işlenmiş, içeriğinde hiçbir tutarsızlık barındırmayan bir dünya aynı zamanda bu. Gerçekten de uzaklarda bir yerlerde, kurumuş toprakların altında böceklerin buna benzer bir şeylerle uğraşabileceğini düşündürüyor insana.

[h3]HARİTA DEDİĞİN BÖYLE TASARLANIR[/h3]
Oyunda çok fazla farklı bölge bulunuyor ve bu bölgelerin tamamı birbiriyle hiç alakası olmayan temalara sahip. Bir yerde yeşilin her tonu etrafınızı sarmalarken, başka bir yerde bal peteklerinin arasında vızıltılar eşliğinde koşturuyorsunuz. Bu temasal farklılıklar, oyun dünyasına ve o bölgenin böceklerine muazzam bir şekilde yedirilmiş. İlk başta anlamıyorsunuz ama oyunda ilerledikçe görüyorsunuz ki, bu bölgelerin tamamı ders niteliğinde bir ustalıkla birbirine bağlanmış durumda. Hollow Knight, bugüne dek gördüğümüz en iyi harita tasarımına sahip oyunlardan diyebiliriz. 

[h3]GRAFİKLER VE MÜZİKLER[/h3]
Ve tam da bu noktada devreye giren o grafikler ve müzikler… Tamamı el çizimi olan grafikler hem o kadar tatlı, hem de tüm duyguları yansıtabilme noktasında o kadar başarılı ki. Özellikle iki boyutlu bir dünyayı dolu dolu yansıtabilmek adına sadece arka planı değil, ekrana doğru üçüncü bir düzlemi de tasarlamış olmaları çok güzel bir detay. Sağa sola koştururken, bir anda ekranın önünden silüet halinde hızla geçen bir böcek görmek, kesinlikle atmosferin içine daha fazla girmenizi sağlıyor. Lakin oyunun grafiklerinden daha iyi olan bir şeyi varsa, o da müzikleri. Yani oyunun görselliği ve müzikleri o kadar iyi ki; Dark Souls’tan hatıra öldüğünde ruhunu gidip geri alma veya birbirinden ilgi çekici boss dövüşleri gibi oynanış mekaniklerinden konuşasım bile gelmiyor (ki oyun bunları da çok iyi bir şekilde yapıyor). 

[h3]GÖZDEN KAÇIRAYIM DEMEYİN![/h3]
%90 üzeri bir tamamlama yüzdesi için 30 ila 40 saat arası bir oyun süresi ayırmanız gerekiyor ki Hollow Knight gibi bir platform oyunu için bu hiç de fena olmayan bir içerik anlamına geliyor. Elbette oyunun yapısı gereği bol bol eski bölgelere geri dönmeniz ve geçtiğiniz yerlerden tekrar tekrar geçmeniz şart ancak Hollow Knight, bir an olsun bunları yaparken sıkılmanıza müsaade etmiyor. | Когда я начал играть у меня были огромные ожидания.

The devs are extremely lucky they have an existing fan base that is loyal - and these same fans themselves admit it is more like Stockholm syndrome than genuine fun. 

Similarly to how Marvel Rivals showed gamers that Overwatch was taking advantage of their playerbase with lackluster updates and content, I truly believe the sole reason this game has managed to stay relevant is a lack of competition in the asymmetrical horror space. 

The licensing they've managed to slowly acquire over the years is what has kept them alive (just look at the popularity of anything Resident Evil related)

Playing as a killer is supposed to feel empowering, but instead, you're often left feeling like a babysitter dealing with a bully squad. Survivors can coordinate so well that it’s impossible to keep up if you're not on their level. Flashlight saves, body blocking, pre-dropping pallets, tea-bagging, it feels like a playground for survivors who know the game inside out. Meanwhile, the pressure to get a 4K every match is so high that you're constantly fighting sweaty survivors who know all the best spots and have the perfect builds.

And let’s not forget matchmaking. Why am I, as a casual killer, being thrown into matches against squads of survivors with 1,000+ hours each? It’s not even close to fair. There's no real system to separate experienced players from new ones, so if you’re not already great at the game, good luck trying to improve without getting stomped over and over again.

As a Survivor
If you’re thinking, “Well, at least survivor gameplay must be more chill, right?” Nope. Not at all. Every game feels like a sweaty tournament. You either face killers that seem to have played the game since day one or ones who camp and tunnel just to secure a single kill. The fun of sneaking around, working on gens, and clutching an escape is replaced with constant stress and sweaty gameplay.

And again, matchmaking makes no sense. One game you’ll have brand-new players on your team who don’t know what they’re doing, and the next, you’re up against a killer that downs everyone in seconds. It’s chaos, and not the fun kind.

Matchmaking is the Root of the Problem
The lack of a proper skill-based matchmaking system ruins the game for both sides. Newer players get stomped, while veterans complain about having no challenge. Without a system that pairs people of similar skill levels, every match feels like a coin toss, either a sweat fest or a completely one-sided stomp.

Where’s the Fun?
Dead by Daylight was meant to be a game of strategy, unpredictability and a bit of horror. Now it feels like an endless grind of frustration, made worse by the fact that the community can be so toxic. What’s the point of playing if every match feels like a competition to out-sweat the other side?

I miss the days when Dead by Daylight was fun. Until the devs fix matchmaking, address bully squads and create a more balanced experience for casual players, I can’t recommend this game anymore.

Final Verdict:

Pros: Great concept, unique gameplay, and cool cosmetics.
Cons: Sweaty gameplay, toxic community, no fair matchmaking, and way too much frustration for something that’s supposed to be fun.
Rating: 4/10 (because I still hold onto hope that it can be fixed). | muito bom o jogo o unico problema é que tem horario que os seriais killers da vida real começa a jogar | O jogo se não fosse a comunidade, seria bom, jogadores na maior parte do tempo toxicos, se vc joga de killer, na hora que vc ganha ja vem os 4 sobreviventes reclamar, retirando que se vc deixa o perfil aberto, eles vem no seu perfil para ser toxico, tem pessoas que jogam de sobreviventes com time fechado(time completo) com call, é toxico a partida inteira e forçam mapa, mas ai quando o killer ganha deles, eles vão lá e reclamam, tem uns que chega até ser racista porque vc ganhou deles, não é possivel que é só comigo isso"

but.. everytime when I die the game freezes and I have to close it in the Task Manager...
Also, after a while playing it paused with the message that my PC wasn't able to play in  the highest settings and it changed to low graphics.. okay than.. It's was fun for me until everything freezes.. 
Is this some kind of bug and do more people have this problem?

Maybe it's a bug and I hope that a new update will clear this problem.

But after all this is an awesome free game! | One of the best free games i've ever played. It has unique characters with it's own unique gun. The movement and controls are fine with not a lot of issues. The graphics are good and optimised. It has challenges for you to do so you dont get bored.

Gold Edition is a hollow attempt to merge Metroidvania with Mexican folklore, resulting in a mismatched cacophony of mediocrity wrapped in a garish, Day of the Dead-themed wrapper. The game revels in its 'humor,' but its jokes land with the grace of a piñata stuffed with cement—forced, cringeworthy, and utterly devoid of wit.

The combat is as repetitive as it is uninspired, relying on a tired combination of button-mashing and awkward platforming segments that feel more like punishment than challenge. The so-called 'luchador aesthetic' is little more than a gimmick, dressing up a shallow experience in flashy tights to distract from its lack of substance.

Worse yet, the constant barrage of meme references and self-aware nods to other games feels like the developers were more interested in fishing for internet brownie points than creating a unique, engaging experience. By the time you trudge through the overlong, derivative levels, you'll wish you'd spent your time wrestling with something less painful—like deleting this game from your library. | It's creative and looks really nice. Love the humorous side of the game as well. There is a lot of good stuff in this short game and an ok story, but not this is the best metroidvania like sidescroller if you like/want to try the genre.
Lot of options and cool stuff to fight and platforming, but sometimes it's really over saturated and punishing.

I enjoyed all that 7 hours to beat it, but there is a technical issue when you enter a new area the game freezes out. (this is a bit annoying and you cannot do anything with it)

If you want a decent game for a decent price you can pick it and buy it, but there are better games in the genre. | Great game, tons of fun... if you can make it run on anything built after 2010! Hahahah | Es un juego muy entretenido, para conseguir todos los logros si me llevo tiempo, más los orbes. Aconsejo que en la primera partida, busquen completar misiones secundarias, cofres y orbes (para desbloquear el final alternativo).

Also, they completely fucked up the ""Assign Controllers"" system and I don't know why. It worked perfectly in Gold Edition but for some reason in this game they force the keyboard and mouse to be Player 1 and the controller to be Player 2 in local co-op. | A shining prime example of how the age of a well made videogame doesn't matter. Have you ever wanted a 2D metroidvania but with deeper combat? Well look no further! With an art style somewhere between classic cartoon network shows and flash animation. I'm not an expert on Mexican culture, but a friend of mine who lives there seems happy enough with this game, it's worth mentioning because EVERYTHING in this game is very much influenced by traditional Mexican culture, music, luchadors and the day of the dead.

What else? Oh yeah, this game has gone through a lot of updates to make it more polished (earlier builds actually needed a seizure warning but that's been fixed!) there's a bonkers 4 player co-op if that's your jam (but no online play which is a massive wasted opportunity) and also lots of LOTS of references to other games, both classic and indie and even internet memes!

Factions all have really strong flavor and personality, so it's nice to just catch a vibe with. Definitely recommended if you're into Stellaris but don't always have the mental bandwidth to create your own roleplay as you go. Turn-based as well, adding to the chill factor. All-around solid game. | One of my favorite games ever. 

Pros:
+ Visuals are eye candy. Smooth and pleasing.
+ Music is ear candy. One of the absolute best soundtracks I have heard from a game.
+ The game-play is very fun, a little overwhelming at first but then it all falls into place.
+ It's turn-base and while not really a plus, I know some folks enjoy calculating their every move unlike RTS.
+ Unlike Stellaris, (another goat) this game has some pretty good lore.

- I HATE HACKING, I DON'T CARE FOR IT, TAKE IT AWAY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD | [h2] Endless Space 2 - Наследница первой пробы пера [/h2]
[i] Я начинал свой путь еще с Endless Space 1 и Endless Space 2 является достойным продолжением вселенной Endless. Участвовал в бета тесте игры и активностях на форуме разработчиков (Таких как выбор внешности некоторых фракций - Несгибаемые и Хор Теней). У игры был долгий путь разработки и она стала результатом трудов, в том числе, многих фанатов вселенной Endless. Что получилось в итоге? [/i]
[h2] За что стоит ее любить эту игру [/h2] 
[list]
    [*][i] Фракции - каждая фракция уникальна, любой игрок сможет выбрать фракцию на свой вкус. Некоторые перекочевали из первой части, но еще больше новых. Основных фракций восемь (без дополнений). Каждая фракция имеет свой сюжет и приличное количество заданий, что помогут познакомиться с ними поближе. 
Например, хочешь быть безумным ученым? Софоны будут тебе по душе, а внешне они напоминают причудливых зеленых человечков. 
Думаешь, что путь к победе, это развитие промышленности и влияние? Единая империя (Местное человечество) идет по этому пути, но даже этот путь ты сможешь изменить. Остаться на пути промышленности, стать ученым или наращивать военную мощь? Ты сможешь принимать судьбоносные решения. [/i]
    [*][i] Геймплей - По сравнению с Endless Space 1 и Endless Legend, расширили и сделали глубже все элементы 4х-стратегий. 
Прохождение основного сюжета поведает вам Академии, космической гильдии героев и ее лидере. Наличие множества побочных заданий, наткнуться на которые ты сможешь просто исследуя мир. Без преувеличения, интересное исследование бескрайнего космоса, где даже исследование странного сигнала на планете, может привести к неожиданному результату. 
Изучение различных веток технологий, от возможности колонизации неприветливых миров до постройки огромных военных крейсеров. Колонизация новых миров и их развитие, в том числе уникальных планет, что были оставлены древней, более развитой расой. Огромное количество торговых и дипломатических возможностей, от покупки ценных ресурсов до заключения альянса между империями. И самые проработанные и захватывающие космические сражения, лучшие в своем жанре. [/i]
    [*][i] Графика - Начиная с главного меню и заканчивая роликом победы одной из фракций, все что вы уведите, будет выглядеть волшебно и завораживающе. Эта игра подарит вам ощущение бескрайнего и неизведанного, местами причудливого космоса (Как на счет фракции высокоразвитых деревьев или роботов, что больше напоминают насекомых поглощающих все на своем пути?). Каждый арт, каждый ролик или эффект от взрыва планеты выполнен на недосягаемо качественном уровне. На мой личный взгляд, в этой игре космос выполнен лучше всего и крупные франшизы, такие как Mass Effect или Star Wars не передают даже крупицы этой красоты. [/i]
    [*][i] Музыка Endless Space 2 - это шедевр, который погружает вас в атмосферу космоса и подчеркивает эпичность происходящего. Композитор Arnaud Roy создал великолепный саундтрек, который идеально сочетается с визуальным стилем игры и подчёркивает уникальность каждой фракции. Музыка разнообразна и эмоциональна. Здесь вы услышите эпические и величественные мелодии, которые сопровождают ваши великие открытия и завоевания, а также более спокойные и лирические треки, которые звучат во время мирного развития империи. [/i]
[/list]
[h2] К сожалению есть и ложка дёгтя в этой бочке мёда [/h2]
[list]
    [*][i] Порог вхождения и интерфейс - как в любой 4х-стратегии это вызов для игрока. Разобраться в механиках игры может быть сложно. В игре есть обучение, но к сожалению оно не столь подробное и даже после его прохождения могут остаться вопросы. Интерфейс игры - это лабиринт из различных вкладок и информации (В том числе сокращений по типу ""5П"", которые не сразу будут ясны новому игроку.). На первый взгляд он выглядит запутанным, но со временем вы привыкнете к нему. К счастью, он не такой перегруженный как в Stellaris. [/i]
    [*][i] Искусственный интеллект - иногда принимает странные решения. К примеру, ты накопил много Пыли (Местная валюта), он может предложить отдать все. С какой радости? Но в целом, он достаточно умен, чтобы бросить вам вызов. [/i]
    [*][i] Дополнения к игре запишу скорее в минусы, так как выходят сомнительными через один. Особенно вызывают вопросы такие дополнения как - Supremacy и Awakening. Подробнее о них расскажу в отдельных обзорах. [/i]
[/list]

[b] Вывод: [/b] [i] Играя Endless Space 2 ты забываешь о времени и погружаешься в мир космических приключений. Как и в любой 4х-стратегии, ты можешь сесть за нее и спустя десяток часов осознать, что провел весь день в этом мире. Она не идеальна, но её достоинства с лихвой перекрывают недостатки. Некоторые недостатки можно исправить, к примеру починить ИИ, в мастерской есть моды, что отлично справляются с этим. Но если ты решил поиграть с друзьями, то этот недостаток не будет заметен вовсе. Если вы любите космос и стратегии, то Endless Space 2 - это ваш выбор <З [/i] | 戦闘は陣形を設定したらあとは見てるだけだがそれが良い

76561197999259031,214950,Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition,8.616666666666667,Strategy,11,"So, this might actually be my favorite Total War game.

I know, I know...someone is recoiling at the thought that I didn't say it was the original, Atilla, etc...but this one just works for me. I don't think Rome I could have had a more worthy successor, all things considered. Did it have a poor launch and could there be some more improvements to make it even better? Yes, and yes...but even now after Warhammer and all the rest, I hold this one to be the Modern Total War Gold Standard.

I've played it so much over the years since launch. I don't even know how many hours since they kept getting reset back in the day, but going by the current tally I know it is A LOT. The controls and combat are pretty intuitive for [i]old[/i] Total War players like myself and for the more modern players. In fact, a lot of the systems you see in later titles got their starts here, so if nothing else Rome II has that going for it.

The setting is just a really dynamic period in history and lends itself well to being able to experience completely different playstyles with the varying factions. There are other Total War games where, as a consequence of when and where they are set, you really all just fight with the same roster of units. That is not the case here. Yes, there are plenty of reskins to be found, but even those aren't always 1:1. The ""jack of all trades"" faction here is, unsurprisingly, Rome. Meanwhile, there are other factions whose rosters focus on more niche that really make them play completely differently. There are some factions that pretty much only rely on cavalry while others heavily encourage long lines of pikes and hoplites. This alone makes the game very replayble since you can hop into something very different whilst keeping all of the familiarity of all of these modernized Total War mechanics...at least modernized circa the last major update.

The campaign map is a fun strategy-management game in of itself, but the battles are where things really shine. You have land and naval combat here, something that wasn't possible in the original title, but had to come from the likes of Empire: Total War. Combat here doesn't play like that other game, though. It is much more of the time focusing on boarding, ramming, and burning. Once on land, combat feels fairly satisfying. You can really develop good strategies with certain army rosters. The AI is, well, still AI, but overall it does tend to give you a reasonable enough challenge. Of the Total Wars, this one is definitely in the decent to good AI camp.

I can't really speak for the multiplayer quality, as it is not something I ever really participated in; however, I can point to the fairly reliable number of active players as indication that, at the very least, there are always people in the greater Rome II community to engage with.

Yes, I could really go on and on about this game, but if there were only one thing I could leave you with it would be this:

I have played every total war game (except Three Kingdoms and that weird mobile one, but I digress), and out of all of those games THIS is the one that I always come back to. I just think it is neat.

With all this said, [i]I highly recommend picking this up,[/i] but if you do so I do recommend going ahead and getting it in a bundle with the DLCs...on sale, preferably. 

It's not that the base game is barren without the extra content; but, as someone who has put hundreds of hours into it, I really can't imagine playing the game without that extra content.

[b][i]Vae victis![/i][/b] | This game is great, but sadly I became the victim of the ""loading screen bug"" lottery.

For some reason on new pc's the battles won't load and you are stuck on the loading screen, it seems that there are no permanent fixes for this so sadly I just can't play the game. This won't happen to all players but for me this means the game is unplayable sadly.

In a way this is a good thing, as I will not be spending next 1000 hours of my life into this game like I was planning to. The Tutorial was very promising. | To make it perfect, I disable civil wars. It takes all your resources to fight the barbarians. I don't like killing off my army every hour or two. I have tried to maintain their loyalty, but it takes lots of effort out of the game play.

As a Latin Teacher, I approve of this game. | 罗马二YYDS，想玩的朋友记得先去创意工坊下（1）中文mod（第一个必下的mod)；接着下一个(2)每回合四分之一年的mod，因为原版是每回合1.25年，时间过得很快，将领、皇帝一下就老死了，都升级不了多少，因为这个mod必须在每个存档建档之前开才有用，你开了存档玩过以后再开此mod就没有用了，所以建议一定要先开这个mod再建存档；（3）下一个无腐败mod，不然到后面你财政崩溃，入不敷出；最后看个人可以下一个无内战mod，这样就可以专心对外征服了。非常不错，也很好玩，真心推荐全战新手第一部玩的作品！ | Rome II in its current state is a fun game which received lots of love to get it to this state, because oh my gosh on release especially considering the advertising and the games that came before it in the series it was terrible. Unfortunately, in a lot of ways it is still too little too late, and if you look at what Creative Assembly has released in the series following this they did not learn their lessons from the failures of this game and have since doubled down on those failures. Any game in the total war series after this one suffers from the lack of character, lack of polish, and blatant cash grabby attitude that has come to dominate the series. 
What does this mean for you as the prospective buyer? These games can be fun, I think you can get good value out of them, but understand that this company at one time was capable of accomplishing far more and giving you a far better product, but either through incompetence or greed they have chosen not to. I think its important you know you're being served fast food and being told its fine dining."

You're part of an alien invasion force, which's goal it is to gather the ressources of Earth, and must defend your Core structures in 14 levels from human attacks.

Like the game description and screenshots already tell, this is a tower defense game, where you actively participate in the fight. You're controlling an alien ship, which can switch between attack mode and ghost mode on the fly, whereby the ghost mode is both a defense mode and your building mode.

The ship itself hast four attacks. A rapid fire dual plasma gun, bombs, anti air rockets and a laser beam, which all offer a secondary fire option. The Plasma gun can be charged to fore a single plasma ball, the bombs can be charged to the Dark Matter bombs, which can destryo buildings, the Rockets offer an EMP attack and the laser creates an anti gravity hole, which is basically a block hole that instantly destroys most enemies. During combat, your ship can be damaged, but also regens health when being out of combat. This also goes for the ghost mode, which makes you invincible, but disables your weapons.

To the gameplay itself: Each level starts with your Core landing on Earth and you have to defend it from waves of attacks, which become harder the longer the level goes on. At the start of each round and between waves, you have an unlimited amount of time to place defense turrets. Like the ships, these turrets have various weapons. Each turret starts with a plasma cannon, but can be upgraded to wield flamethrowers, artillery guns, lasers and anti air weapons.

The amounts of turrets and upgrades you can build is limited by a ressource meter, which is filled up by beating a wave, killing enemies or collecting their scrap with a ship upgrade. Additionally to their weapons, turrets also have impassable laser fences, which can be used to block off enemy routes, so that it takes more time for them to reach your Core and to funnel mutliple enemies into a choke point. Between the waves and during combat, turrets can be relocated and reconfigurated. For example, if you fought of a bunch of bombers and now a group of soldiers is walking along the turret during the next wave, you can change the anti air gun into the flamethrower free of charge. Relocating turrets is also free and you also get your spent ressources back, if one of your turrets gets destroyed, which makes the game player friendly.

The enemies are a slightly futuristic, global army, which resemble the GDI from Command and Conquer. They have tanks, APCs, helicopters, fighter jets, anti air units and other vehicles, which all are serving different purposes. Tanks for example, just attack your core, anti air vehicles are serving as a medic unit and attack the placer, APCs deploy infantry units if not destroyed and bombers target your structures on their flight path. Additionally to that, the game also has three boss enemies, which all work a bit differently and bring a small bullet hell element into the game. | 太爽了，不管是游戏内容还是剧情都爽完了

76561197999259031,410380,HEX: Shards of Fate,0.5,"Adventure, Free To Play, RPG, Strategy",0,"The purpose of this review is to help you determine if HEX: Shards of Fate is a good fit for you. There are a number of quality games on Steam that receive negative reviews simply because they don’t fit the head-shape, budget, and/or difficulty level of certain players. If you really want the TL:DR of this review, go and look at the number of hours played by the positive reviews compared to the number of hours played by the negative reviews. I am a 41-year-old professional with a full-time work schedule. As an avid PC gamer that can no longer keep up with the demands of traditional MMO play times, HEX has been a blessing for me. I have been absolutely enamored with the game’s PvP and PvE and I have been steadily improving thanks to a very helpful community.
 
THE PAY MODEL

In order to make a proper determination whether or not HEX is the game for you, you should first understand what this game is and how the pay model works. HEX: Shards of Fate is a trading card game with various PvP and PvE formats. The client can be downloaded without making a purchase and some basic cards as well as all PvE formats can be played free of charge. Additional cards are purchased in packs on a per-pack basis just like real world trading card games like Magic and Pokemon. Cards can be traded among players and bought and sold on the Auction House for either of the game’s currencies. There is Platinum which is purchased with real money and used to buy packs and VIP time, and Gold which is earned by participating in PvE. HEX is not intended to be a Free to Play game. It is a virtual trading, collectable card game that shares aspects of real life card games. In order to fully utilize and appreciate what HEX has to offer you should expect to invest a significant (but reasonable) amount of time and money.

THE ECONOMY

Cards can be bought and sold for both Platinum and Gold on the virtual Auction House. Platinum is originally purchased with real money and is used to buy packs and VIP time. Gold is earned mostly in PvE.  Gold can be used to buy auction house items, Stardust to make cards ‘Extended Art’, and to ‘roll’ on treasure chests which are obtained by buying pack and completing PvE tasks. The HEX economy very nicely allows players with varying preferences of PvP and PvE to exchange desired virtual items. The modest VIP program is free of any Pay-To-Win rewards. Also, you should be aware that there is a robust ‘unregulated’ secondary market where players can sell their collection for real world cash. It’s unsanctioned by Cryptozoic and provides a way for players to receive some of their cash investment back if they decide to move on. This might seem shady at first but it’s akin to going in to your local hobby shop and buying and selling cards there. I put $400 in to Hearthstone and ended up hating the game but since you can’t freely trade cards, I have no way to get any of that back. 

PLAYER VS. EVIROMENT

PvE in HEX currently features two modes of play. There’s a Campaign where you can pick a champion, explore the map, and raid solo dungeons. The other mode is the Frost Ring Arena where you compete with AI controlled champions. The AI difficulty level in both modes is intentionally set at ‘easy’ to ‘medium’ in my estimation. The ‘dumb’ AI is a negative for some players that want a more challenging PvE experience. For most players however, PvE is a form of grinding and the challenge is to figure out deck and equipment designs that can farm the quickest. My favorite aspect of PvE is the Equipment system. Champions can equip certain pieces of armor and weapons that give cards in their decks powerful attributes. It’s a brilliant system that allows for the design of fun, powerful decks in PvE without creating balance issues in PvP.

PLAYER VS. PLAYER

HEX has a number of PvP formats that appeal to a variety of players based on their tastes. There’s Constructed modes that allow a player to use any PvP eligible card in their collection and there are Gauntlets and Draft mode where players use only cards that are obtained by opening packs. Constructed Mode is highly competitive and since players can use any card in their collection, you will need to make an investment to earn the cards that will allow you to be competitive. You can design budget decks that will help you advance up the ladder but you’ll need to invest and collect some nice cards to be a solid competitor. For players that prefer a more ‘level’ competition there’s Gauntlets and Drafts. Cards in this mode are obtained directly from packs that are opened for that tournament. The cards obtained are completely random for each player and it’s up to you to design the best deck possible. After the tournament concludes, the cards obtained are added to your collection and can be used or traded as you see fit. 

THE COMMUNITY AND DEVELOPERS

The community is one of the major selling features to me and is why I enjoy HEX so much. There are a number of excellent guilds <Insert Shameless Plug for Cornerstone> and well-produced guides in the form of videos and blogs. The players here are mature and helpful. Any game with PvP will attract ass-hats of course, but in the two months I’ve been playing, I can count on one hand the number of rude comments that I’ve encountered in chat during a match. The Twitch/Youtube community is excellent and quite often coordinates with Cryptozoic Entertainment. For instance, during the latest patch, a second, pre-patched server was set up so streamers could highlight the upcoming changes during down time. My perception is that Cryptozoic communicates with the player base often and they understand the concerns, needs, and wants of players. I like their transparency regarding their policies and I think their financial model is fair and well done.

CONCLUSION

Like many of you I suffered a long period of MMO’s that became P2W and games that were released too early. I’m truly grateful that I found HEX. Cryptozoic Entertainment is a smaller developer and there’s content and quality of life improvements that all of us want sooner rather than later, but at the end of the day, this is an excellent product. If you’re looking for a hobby to sink your teeth in to or you’re considering trying your first TCG, this is the game for you. HEX is Grade A, bonafide Trading Card Game with gorgeous artwork and easy to learn, difficult to master gameplay. I hope you give it a solid try!

Edited for length conformity. | В первый раз пишу отзыв об игре, но тут прям уже наболело.

Пытаюсь начать в эту ОТЛИЧНУЮ игру почти с самого ее старта, и никак...
Это наверно единственная игра, где я потратил столько сил впустую.
Хочу сразу сказать, что я не TCG профи, есть опыт игры во многие подобные игры на уровне казуала, не более.

Что же предлагает нам HEX чтобы начать играть?
1. Полностью донатный вариант - покупаем платину, на нее покупаем паки и плату за вход в соревнования.
Один пак стоит на ауке около 160 платины.
Вход в драфт стоит 3 пака и 100 платины = 580. Это около 300 рублей.
И было бы ок, но первые 20 раз новичек в драфте обречен на слив. Потому что нужен опыт, которого бесплатно взять в этой игре НЕГДЕ. Вот и приходится платить за сливы.
2. Вариант компромисный - 100 платины покупаем на реал, 3 пака фармим за голду. Могу сказать четко - это бред. 1 пак стоит 25к, в пве хоть какую-то прибыль дает арена, за фулран зарабатываешь 6-7к в 40 минут. Я пофармил, и получается что на один драфт нужно фармить примерно неделю онлайна. То есть ты тупо гоняешь одних и тех же боссов неделю за то чтобы один раз зайти в драфт и слить.
3. Ну больше вариантов нету. Либо ты хорошо драфтишь (гантлетишь) и с первого доната уходишь вверх... либо ты всю жизнь гоняешь компьютерных болванчиков в ""данжах"".
Я бы очень хотел, чтобы была какая-то подписка, рублей за 400 в месяц, которая давала бы хотя бы один вход в турнир в неделю бесплатно. Это была бы хоть какая-то точка старта. А так получается, что там играют одни папки сами с собой.

И я вообще слабо понимаю, зачем делают эту кампанию. Заработать там нельзя, карты для пвп или входы в турниры получить нельзя. В чем вообще смысл то??
Все эти разговоры про ""рейды и гильдии""... Это типа будет собираться 10 человек и мочить компьютерного ОП бота? Не знаю кому это интересно. 

Еще раз, я хочу сказать что я не против платить за игру. Но в текущей реализации - это просто не оправданно. | HEX is by fantastic example of what can be achieved by a true trading card game in the digital space. The quickest way to descibe the game is Magic: The Gathering with a threshold based resource system and unique mechanics that would only be possible in a digital TCG. 

You preserve everything offerred by physical CCGs such as complete open trading system and third party support and add to it a digital auction house, in-game tournament support, ladder system and a respectable single player experience (although admitiedly still shallow compared to their Kickstarter promises) which adds a somewhat viable way to enjoy the mechanics without spending any money.

That is to say, HEX's F2P avenue requires an extreme amount of luck or time if you want to construct some of the most potent PvP decks via only the PvE content. Time in grinding the PvE content until you have enough of the PvE currency to trade for sealed tournament entries and luck in that you do well enough in those sealed tournaments via wins or opening cards that sell well to pay for the next entry fee and make a profit.

To give some perspective to that a sealed tournament entry costs generally $5 and gets 2 boosters ($2 value each) with the potential to get 3 more boosters if you do well enough. Simply getting 1 win gets you an additional booster so that already would put you ahead on base value in addition to keeping the cards you open. In additon, there are multiple rare cards that sell for $1+ and some of the top end cards can go for $20+. If you get lucky enough to snag some of those and sell them on the AH or on the Trade channel you can keep yourself running tournaments for a good while.

I have always been a stickler for dropping money into an online game and not having anything to show for it if I stop playing, but since HEX fully supports trading and third party sites if you ever want to cash out your account you can and depending on how much effort you want to put into selling off your collection you could even turn a profit.

In the future, HEX has promised to flush the single player experience out into a full multiplayer PvE experience with raids and dungeons for players to team up against. Not sure how far off this is and a number of Kickstarters are salty about the delay (rightly so), but as it stands now I fully recommend HEX as being the only digital TCG out there that has a comprehensive feature set, friendly community (Twitch & Reddit) and enjoyable complex strategic gameplay. | I am a F2P Beta player, and have spent many hours grinding the PVE content to build my collection. I have tried a lot of different card games, and Hex is currently my favorite.

GAMEPLAY
If you know how to play MTG, you know how to play Hex. It is your standard “mana” driven TCG. It fully takes advantage of its digital nature, summoning cards from outside your collection, permanently modifying cards, and even completely changing cards in play. This adds a huge layer of strategy as deciding to kill a 1/1 creature by doing one damage or giving it -1/-1 matters when the card remembers its stats even in the discard pile!

ECONOMY / COST
The game has two currencies, Plat (real money) and Gold (in game money). The only time you need Plat is when entering tournaments, everything else can be bought with Gold.

The game has an auction house and the ability to trade with other players. It is a true TRADING card game as opposed to a COLLECTIBLE card game. You can turn Gold into Plat by trading with other players or selling cards in the auction house. 

It is easy to grind Gold, you can challenge the AI in the Arena and get progressively larger rewards for winning (and even if you lose, you keep everything you won up to that point). You also have the campaign which continually rewards money and cards.

STABILITY / LAG

For the most part, the game is stable with reasonable performance. When a new release or event begins, the performance may suffer due to the increased load, but the developers usually handle that fairly quickly and increase the capacity. In my time playing, the performance has gotten better over all.

A few deck strategies are also particularly taxing on the game, such as spider based decks which create massive amounts of creatures. This can be mildly annoying, but usually isn't game breaking. 


TOURNAMENTS
There are regularly occurring constructed and sealed tournaments. There are even queues which you can enter and play at your leisure over days instead of playing all at once. Entry fee is inexpensive and winning gets you packs.

Constructed - This is your standard tournament. Build a deck and play to win. I avoid this as those who spend money clearly have an advantage.

Draft - A fairly well designed mode though there can be a lot of waiting involved. Players draft from a common pool of cards so everyone is on equal ground. The problem is you can have players who simply take the rares for their collection.

Sealed - This is my favorite type of mode as everyone starts on equal footing and you keep all the cards. It is particularly fun to play in “Gauntlet” mode as you can play your 3 to 7 games over however long you want, the pool of opponents constantly refreshes.

PVE / Adventure Zones
Last but not least is the PVE content. You choose a race and class which grants you special abilities and a starting deck. You then travel the world facing various challenges as you help your faction win a war. You can also hire mercenaries which provide you with even more options.

You can play this fairly effectively without spending any money. The opponents are interesting, and there are special PVE cards which are much too powerful or random for PVP games. This also earns you gold which can then be used to buy packs or enter into tournaments. 

I strongly recommend Hex! | This games is very addicting. I never thought an online battle card game could be this fun! 

Pros: Beautiful graphics. Great story line. More control of your cards during battle. I love how you can advance your character with skill trees and customize your deck and character with socketable cards and sets of gear.

Cons: The battle can be a bit tedious at times, especially when you are first starting out. There is not a way to cancel or change your actions before finalizing them (or at least not one that is readily seen).

Overall, this is the best card battle game I have played. It is a bit complex and challenging, but the balance of the complexity and story line/game content is well enough that the player stays engaged."

- A real and generous free to play
It's probably the one that you'll need the less grind to come up with a decent card collection as every single game you play gives you gold to buy new cards, with no daily restriction of any sort. This plus regular campaign missions makes it easy to buy new packs every day. You will NEVER have so spend a dime to get anything in this game, you can get it all by just playing.

- An efficient ressource system
The level/mana combo gives an interesting strategy approach and the possibility to exchange a card to pick a mana one every turn removes the death mana plays you can find in other games

- No RNG cards
Don't count on RNG cards to win a game. Yeah, you're in charge!

- Daily tournaments
Some for free, some with a ""ticket"" entry. Tickets can easily be bought with in-game gold. Various types of game proposed makes it interesting to play.

- You can even gain real money
Yes you read it right. Every month there is a minimum poll of 250$ plus a percentage of the money spent in the game by all the players given the winner of the monthly tournament. Did I say the registration for this tournament was free? A serious taunt to competitive players!

I really encourage to try this game and if you need a little boost to get started just let me know, I'd be happy to sponsor you in game which will grant you a nice 75k gold to start with when creating a new account. | I would give this game a neutral recommendation,but Steam won't allow that so until either that happens or the game improves,I keep it as a no.My reasons for it are the balance issues and some awkward rules. The game itself is good, if you like Magic: The gathering, you will probably like this too. 

You know something is not right when you look at the top 10 players and 6 of them are with a Darkness deck. Basically there are 2 strong factions and if you play anything else you will struggle to win. 
Unlike in most games there are no counterspells and no reaction phase where you can react to an enemy spellcast. Combined with the fact that Darkness for instance has really cheap ""Destroy Creature"" cards and by cheap I mean they are often cheaper than the creature they destroy. Yes,the enemy can instantly kill most of your creatures without you being able to keep them alive and does this with the same or fewer resources. 
Example: 
""Destroy a creature with 2 atk or less""-2 mana,level 1
My collection of ~250 DIFFERENT cards has no creature with the same or less cost that has 3 attack or more and most that have a higher manacost get destroyed by just this card as well.This game really needs to have weaker or more expensive creature shots.

I know it seems like a bad reason to not recommend something,but when you play 6-7 out of 10 games against the very same decks and basically have no chance to win unless you do it as well the whole thing becomes extremely repetitive and loses diversity. | I give this game something between good and bad. The mechanism is similar to MTG but better adapted for online. The art is very good and the game mechanism is mostly well developed, but the game is very inbalance and strategies are very rigid. I am playing several good CCG games and on this one it quickly become uninteresting and somewhat monotonous. 

Most matches are decided by a single card that the opponent or you can do nothing to counter. Also, by knowing what strategy you have and the opponent have you can guest know who is going to win, no matter the luck or how hard you play. There is no much strategy, besides the deck building, and winning decks are hevily based on golden cards. 

Some mechanism are confusing, like flying, or blocking. Same as MTG, lands are drawn from the deck. They tried to correct the luck factor with some weird mechanism, but it would be much better if players can freely choose how to manage the mana. 

The game has a lot of potential, but it need sharpness and balance. | I really wish i could give this game a full thumbs up, but for now it's pretty much sideways..
If you can see past the maze of (recurring) bugs/glitches & twitches, this game isn't actually all that bad really. It's still my favourite card game nonetheless! 
However it's likely never ever going to get properly fixed in that department, so i can't personally ""fully"" recommend this game..
It's still a very rewarding and fun card game however, so if you're looking for something like that (with lots of grinding if you're a collector etc) then it might just be your type of game. 
I've been playing this for some years now and still it randomly disconnects or crashes with no apparent reason on random occasions. >still happens at times<
It's a shame really because this card game could have been one of the absolute greats, sadly it doesn't quite delivers what it actually tries to promise.. (the dlcs are also somewhat pricey, though you can save up on Gold (or with the rarer Crystals) and get some with it instead -more grinding- of course)

Fun, complex but also with its flaws and shortcomings.

Personal score: 7'5/100 | I used to play the game but i decided to change my review from positive to negative.
The reasons are simple.
1)Developers have reduced the 2.000 dollar prize to mere 250 dollar.
2)The game doesnt have enough answers if combo decks like purple/blue plays the 4 5/5 flying drake he will start combo you until you are dead.Yes you pay 4 mana to do 5 damage but the problem is basic despina herself and the lack of game mechanic.When Drake's effect activates the game doesnt let you to answer against this combo and it started to get annoying.
3)lack of balance of some cards.Ghoul 3/3 was a fking example altough they did nerf it but after begging them for months.
4) and last reason i quitted is because cards like Grand Reunion and Skatador's binding simply they cant be removed because the game has very lower number of  removing spells from the field.Grand Reunion is most of times an auto win card.I hate when games dont have enough answers.Thats what mostly made me quit it.I hope they do better and learn the lesson because having no fking removals,having no fking answers against threats it turns the game to being toxic and being unfun."

the bubble spell was too annoying | The old man squinted at the horizon, the setting sun casting long shadows across the desert. He'd seen his fair share of sandstorms, but this one looked like a beast with a vendetta. It was a race against time, and the tower was winning. He wiped the sweat from his brow with a gritty sleeve and took a step back to survey his work. It was a marvel, a tower of bricks and mortar that seemed to dance in the shifting sands.The tower was not just tall; it was a labyrinth of intricate designs and patterns that would make even the most seasoned architect scratch their head in wonder. Each brick laid with precision, each line of mortar a testament to the builder's unyielding dedication. He had a gift, a telepathic connection with the very materials he used. It was as if the tower whispered its secrets into his mind, guiding his hands as he shaped it brick by brick.As the storm grew closer, the air thick with the scent of dust and the promise of chaos, the tower's top swayed precariously. The old man knew that the tower was almost complete, but the final stretch was the most critical. He took a deep breath and began to climb the wobbling structure, his calloused hands finding purchase in the jagged edges of the bricks. The wind howled around him, but he remained focused, his thoughts a silent chant of balance and stability.With each step, he communicated with the tower, his mind a symphony of silent commands. The bricks hummed in response, shifting ever so slightly to accommodate his weight, the mortar hardening on the fly to hold them in place. The tower was alive under his touch, a living, breathing testament to his will.Reaching brick number 97, his muscles quivered with fatigue. Yet the storm was almost upon them, the tower's fate hanging in the balance. He paused, the wind screaming around his ears, and took stock of the situation. The mud huts surrounding the tower, the simple homes of his fellow villagers, were in danger of being swallowed by the sands if the tower didn't stand. His heart swelled with determination.As he laid the final brick, the first drops of sand began to pelt his skin. He could feel the tower's spirit pulsing through him, urging him to complete the task. The builder closed his eyes, his thoughts reaching out to the tower. Suddenly, an image of a new creation flashed through his mind: a second tower, even grander than the first, but built from a material untouched by the desert's fury. The bricks grew warm under his palms, the mortar alive with new purpose. The tower steadied, a beacon of hope against the approaching storm.With the last of his strength, he leaped from the tower's peak to the safety of the nearest hut, his eyes never leaving his creation. The desert trembled as the storm struck, sand whipping through the air in a frenzied dance. Yet, amidst the chaos, the tower stood firm, a silent sentinel. The builder watched with a mix of exhaustion and awe as the sandstorm raged around them, knowing that he had given everything to this tower and it had given him a vision to build another.The storm eventually passed, leaving behind a landscape transformed. The old man emerged from his shelter, the sand coating his face and body like a second skin. He looked upon the tower with pride, knowing that it was not just a shelter from the storm, but a symbol of their resilience. The villagers gathered, their eyes reflecting the hope that now stood tall in the heart of their community. And as they turned to the builder, their whispers of awe grew louder, telling the story of the man who had tamed the desert itself.But the builder's thoughts were already on the next challenge. His mind swirled with the image of a tower that could stand against even the fiercest of nature's onslaughts. He knew that the true test of his abilities was yet to come. The power of his albinism had revealed to him a new material, something untouched by the desert's harsh embrace. With renewed vigour, he set forth to gather his tools, ready to embark on a new journey, to craft a tower that would reach the very heavens.As the sand settled into a freshly rearranged landscape, a figure emerged from the desert. It was a woman, tall and slender, with eyes that matched the desert's newfound stillness. Her white hair fluttered in the gentle breeze that followed the storm, a stark contrast to the dark locks of the villagers. Her garments, though simple, shimmered with a subtle iridescence, hinting at an origin far from the village. She approached the tower, her gaze lingering on its peak as if it whispered secrets to her."
76561197999259031,310380,Unknown,0.0,,0,"Fractured Space ist ein Teambasiertes Moba Spiel welches man vom Grundprinzip her mit LoL,Dota etc. vergleichen kann.
Ich werde nur die positiven und negativen Aspekte aufzählen,wer Infos zum Gameplay haben möchte kann sich die Beschreibung sowie Youtube Videos anschauen.

Pro:
+Open Development
(Die Entwickler befassen sich sehr stark mit den Mitspielern und zeigen ihren Entwicklungsplan offen auf dieser Website https://trello.com/b/pOsdj00F/fractured-space.Dort können Spieler ebenfalls Ideen einbringen und abstimmen welches Feature als nächtes entwickelt werden soll bzw. verbessert.Desweiteren kommen regelmäßig Entwickler auf die Gameserver wo man diese direkt ansprechen kann und aauch immer ein Feedback bekommt.Zusätzlich gibt es einen TS3 Server auf dem des öfteren ein ""Community Day"" abgehalten wird und man sich mit den Entwicklern sogar unterhalten kann,gesprochen wird natürlich nur in English.

+Hübsche Grafik
(Die Unreal Engine 4 bringt in diesem Spiel eine gute Leistung.Licht/Schatten,Effekte sowie Texturen sehen Größtenteils sauber und naja spacig aus^^.)

+Große Auswahl an Schiffen
(Es gibt trotz Early Acess eine Ganze Armada an verschiedenen Schiffen welche sich meistens komplett unterschiedlich spielen und einsetzen lassen.)

+Free to play Model
(Nach der Alpha wird dieses Spiel Free to play und wenn ich dass richtig beurteilen kann dann kein Pay2Win.Man kann sich im moment nur Tarnungen bzw. Skins für seine Schiffe von echten Geld kaufen,den Rest muss man sich erspielen.
Es gibt zwar Premiumschiffe nur sind diese identisch mit ihren normalen Ebenbildern und haben keine erhöten Stats,sondern geben lediglich mehr exp/credits am ende einer Runde)

+Einfache,saubere Steuerung
(Die Steuerung des Schiffes ist ziehmlich simpel gehalten trotzdem können erfahrenere Spieler anspruchsvollere Manöver ausführen als Anfänger.Also kann man sich im Spielstil weiterentwickeln was einen imensen Vorteil in manchen Situationen bringen kann.)

+Startegie Faktor
(Durch die meist langsame Bewegung der Schiffe kann man nicht immer überall sein,so muss man sich überlegen wo man als nächstes hinspringt.Man muss sich oft überlegen ob man im Sektor A bleibt oder doch lieber zu B springt um da weiter zu kommen bzw. zu verteidigen.Es gibt noch viele weitere Faktoren die ich hier nicht aufzählen möchte trd. hat dieses Spiel eine strategische Tiefe die man nicht unbeachtet lassen darf.)

Kontra:

- Bugs,teilweise unbalanciert,Crashes
(Dieses Kontra enpfinde ich als eher nichtig,da dass Spiel sich in einer Alpha befindet und somit Fehler haben darf.
Dennoch gibt es oft Mapbugs,das Spiel crashed durch Ladefehler,am Anfang einer Runde hängt sich der Server auf wodurch man warten oder das Spiel neu starten muss,manche Schiffe können mit anderen kaum bzw. garnicht mithalten usw.
Ich gehe aber davon aus,da ich oft mit entwicklern gesprochen habe,dass diese Kindheitsfehler noch behoben werden.)

-schlechte Performance/schlechte Server
(Auf meinem PC läuft dass Spiel am Anfang einer Runde sauber mit 70-80 fps allerdings verschlechtern sich diese drastisch auf bis zu 20-30 fps wenn es zu einem großen Kampf kommt.Mein PC setup steht in meiner Profilbeschreibung,ich selbst klassifiziere es als mid-high system.Wenn die Entwickler wirklich ein Free2Play Model wollen sollten sie an diesem Punkt ordentlich schrauben,sonst werden die meisten Spieler von diesem Spiel ablassen nur wegen der Performance.
Außerdem verursacht die hohe Latenz von durchschnittlich 100 eine ziehmlich bemerkbare verzögerung in der Steuerung.)


Ich persönlich vertraue auf die Entwickler da diese schon oft gezeigt haben dass sie können und wollen.
Die nahe Zusammenarbeit mit der Community und die Regelmäßigen Updates machen dieses Spiel immer besser und immer mehr Gamer tummeln sich auf den Servern.
Das größte Kontra ist die relativ schelchte Performance und der stetig hohe Ping,was das Gameplay teilweise komplett zerstört.Es wär schade wenn so ein Spiel gemieden wird,nur weil es schlechte Server und eine madige Perfomance besitzt.

Meinerseits eine Kaufempfehlung an Spieler die Sci-Fi mögen und an Competetive Moba Gamer.

Ps. über Feedback zum Review freue ich mich immer :)

 | Интересная неторопливая поначалу игра в космические кораблики плавно перетекла в активный тактический шутер с прокачкой корабля. Кораблей не очень много и на сегодня они напоминают TF2 персонажей: тяжелый и неторопливый танкующий крепыш, снайпер, шпион-подсиратель, середнячок для масс и т.д... Ну разве что для авианосца нет особого аналога. И шляп нет. Зато можно менять орудия, причем принцип действия каждого может отличаться кардинально (Например, ракеты или торпеды летят с разной скоростью и скорость наведения тоже разная, у каких-то торпед вообще наведение почти нулевое).
_
Для альфы очень неплохой задел, т.к. способности кораблей далеко не всегда помогают и решает правильное позиционирование себя на поле боя, и в соло бой вряд ли вытащишь, как бы хорошо ты не управлял кораблем, как бы не использовал астероиды для укрытия, как бы не уходил в инвиз или использовал преимущество в скорости. Игра нетороплива, но в итоге четкий просчет скоростей и состава кораблей противника позволяют творить невероятные гамбиты и вождения за нос. 
_
Для альфы стандартный набор минусов: на 28 января малый онлайн (в основном пользователи Нового Света), Ошибки матчмейкинга и частые зависания при входе в матч, в моем случае пришлось дополнительно настроить ярлык на запуск с дискретной видеокартой, как и со всеми альфами, бетами и иногда даже готовыми релизами.

　ゲーム内には様々な艦船がすでに実装されており、ステルス航行が可能なものや、そのステルス航行している艦船をブイを設置し探知するもの、短距離ワープを繰り返しながら戦うもの、高いHPをもった対空砲（範囲攻撃）を連射して戦うもの、長距離狙撃と味方の火力アップを担うもの、味方のHP回復や相手の武器やスキルを一時的に無効化するものなどがあります。

　それぞれの船ごとに得意な戦い方があり、苦手な相手がいます。従って○○を選べば最強というものではありません。しかしながら事前にチームを組んで戦うものではないため、その場で出会った人とチームを組んで戦う事が多く、結果的に誰もが対処できない艦船が相手に居るため負けることもあります。

　最後に。SF好きな人にとって、初期に乗れる艦船ですら、「あ、ここに飛行甲板がある！」「これは砲台だな？」と見ているだけでも結構うれしいのでは？

Fractured space is a 5 vs. 5 team battle on areas of space that has been divided in various sectors. All sectors have control points you need to capture in order to advance and eventually make your way to enemy base. During combat you can freely fly in the battlefield, warp into sectors where the combat is currently going on and warp back to base to regroup or to run away with your nearly destroyed ship for repairs. 

There's currently 15 different ship types in game, 3 of them unlocked right at the start. Ship types fit for many roles: long range, hard hitting sniper boat, heavily armored flagship for more close range combat, sneaky & stealthy assassin ship, fast moving frigate etc. As the game is currently in it's early stages, it understandably might have some balance issues between various ship designs - though I personally feel like every ship has their own use and an organized group will easily take down those solo snipers or assassins who think they can/should be able to kill everything themselves. 

PROs: 
Awesome ship design 
Well made level 
Graphics, sfx 

CONs 
1(one) level 
Very low playerbase (seen max of 54) 
Level Matching system(isn't one) 
No real training/tutorials 

For an EARLY ACCESS game, its good, Its not super great, but its really entertaining. Graphics are great, has a solid gameplay. People here are giving it negative reviews because they want a finished product but its no where near that stage yet. The game is great at its current stage and it can only get better from here. I'd definitely recommend this game for anyone who loves space sci-fi. | This game is a lot of fun. It's easy to play but there are a lot of intricacies for certain parts that if you learn will really help you. There isn't any sort of ""pay to win"" aspect of this game. All of the crew packs can be obtained through premium currency (Platinum) or standard currency that you earn in game (Credits). Other purchases are merely cosmetic, they are reskins of the ships. Different paint jobs and the like. Ships can be purchased with Platinum or Credits. 
The game is fair, and a lot of fun. The AI is actually really good in my opinion and at times can be rather challenging. 
I highly recommend this game, and I hope the developers keep working on it, adding more ships and *maps* and different crews."

Unfortunately there's not as much money in that compared to repackaging them or putting them behind a subscription service.

I respect the original concept but not the decision of delisting it to avoid competing with yourself. A similar sentiment towards the also delisted Dreamcast Collection. | Realmente queria jugar varios juegos de sega genesis en esta coleccion. Compre este juego en un pack hace mucho, pero lamentablemente, no lo instale cuando lo compre. Y ahora a la fecha del 2025, resulta que ni aunque tenga el juego en mi libreria, me sirve poder acceder a la biblioteca completa de los juegos de Genesis. 
Al menos en la Switch pude comprar la coleccion y esos juegos se mantendran. Pero en mi Steam Deck, la biblioteca que aparece en la interfaz del juego es desalentadora, solo 2 juegos DLC aparecen. Una perdida de tiempo total. | Of course they delisted it! That's what SEGA does. They make a compilation but only one press of it, then they make a new version for the next consoles but it's worse. Then they put the games on Steam and remove them because they're working on ANOTHER compilation, this time with an atrocious UI, and later remove that as well. Mark my words, Switch 2 is coming out for way more money than reasonable and SEGA mentioned wanting to revive some of their popular franchises, two of which have since been made better by other companies, two of which were tried previously and came out awful - they're not making AAA revisits of the greats, they're making WayForward vibe games for $40 each and will pump out another compilation. I want to be wrong and say they're gonna give us gold but it's SEGA. Trust me, I want this to age very poorly but, c'mon, we care about them more than they do about themselves. | I bought this “collection “ before it was pulled from the store. Once I DL it and opened it there was only one game in the collection. Golden Axe. Am I missing something? I thought it had more than 50 games in this like the others."
76561197999259031,205230,Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit,0.0,Action,0,"Played this game on and off since its release, just beat it, and let me say, its not worth it. very obnoxious floaty controls, the whole warioware kill gimmick facilitates a bunch of shitty bullet sponges. There are ton of weapons but very few enemies worth using them on. Stylish i guess, but man why did i need to finish this game? | Un gran juego de mi adolescencia. En general es muy divertido. Controlar al personaje en la rueda se siente bien. Aunque cuando hay que hacer plataformeo se siente medio tosco. A la hora de usar al personaje caminando es incluso más tosco. Pero el plataformeo es mínimo así que no le doy importancia.
Usar las armas también es muy divertido, pero el juego tiene un problema de balanceo muy grande. Esto se debe a la tercera mejora de cualquiera de los dos tipos de armas (particularmente las de misiles combinada con la escopeta). Te vuelves demasiado roto al punto de que el jefe final acaba siendo extremadamente fácil. Es por esa razón que el juego agrega muchísimos insta-kills por todos lados. Esta es la manera del juego de agregar dificultad. No sé, se siente medio feo.
Al matar a un monstruo, juegas un pequeño minijuego. Y estos son pintorescos. Son un detalle más para agregarle más carisma al juego. Sin embargo, creo que hay muy pocos. Te terminas cansando de ver los mismos minijuegos una y otra vez. A veces tienen leves variaciones en los gráficos pero nada muy wow.
Los visuales son...algo baratos. El artstyle en general se ve bien, pero las animaciones no tanto. Se nota más que nada en los minijuegos al matar a un monstruo. Algunas cosas apenas están animadas y se sienten como si agarraras una imagen en Paint y la mueves con el mouse.
Hay muy poco que hacer en el post-game. Solo hacer las misiones secundarias, revelar todo el mapa y desbloquear los sombreritos restantes con la isla. Desearía que hubiera más ya que siento que los juegos de este estilo de exploración deberían tener otra cosa. No sé, historias secundarias, monstruos secretos, new game plus, algo.
Divertido juego en general. Le vendría bien un remake o mejor aún una secuela que mejore en todos los aspectos que mencioné. | literal meu jogo de infância, e mesmo depois de tanto tempo ainda continua bom

76561197999259031,205950,Jet Set Radio,0.0,Action,0,"One of the greatest games of all time. Very unique. Great music, visuals, and characters. | The controls in this game have not aged super well, but with a little persistence there is still some fun to be found here. It also sucks that it is no longer available on Steam. The main reason that i wanted to post this review was to direct those that want the experience of this game, but with updated controls towards Bomb Rush Cyberfunk. I grew up with Jet Set Radio and Jet Set Radio Future and felt like Bomb Rush surpassed my nostalgia for these games. | Good game even 25 years later. It certainly has issues like aged platforming, finicky camera, character movement could be tighter, and some missions being a bit frustrating due to the aforementioned issues along with machine-gun enemies but it's short so it doesn't stick out too much. It's got a good artstyle, simple story,  amazing soundtrack, and interesting level design. I do wish the map would let you choose the different 'sections' but given how old the game is, learning the map and the transition points make sense. If SEGA releases the sequel that's in development, I'll definitely be checking it out. | Wonderful game, not so wonderfully translated gameplay controls. 7/10 if you include the buggy gameplay, otherwise no complaints, I absolutely love this game! | I hope you had a chance to buy this gem. It's hours of fun. I hope the classic Sega titles return at some point with modernized controls and visuals and of course Steam Achievements."
76561197999259031,4720,Condemned: Criminal Origins,0.0,Action,0,"One of my favorite 360 era games. A really good suspense/thriller detective game with some horror elements sprinkled throughout. Honestly the game that kicked off my love for horror due to the ""The only way out of this is by going through it"" eerie feel the game provokes. My playtime isn't accurate, you can get a solid 8-12 hours out of the story which I think is pretty standard for the era this game released. I recommend this game if you enjoy titles like Amnesia, Call of Cthulhu, and F.E.A.R | One of the all time greats IMO. If this looks remotely interesting to you, I would say pick it up 5 out of 5⭐️ | If you are fan of F.E.A.R. and F.E.A.R. 2, then definitely you should play Condemned: Criminal Origins, cuz atmosphere is quite similar and not only that, you should play this, cuz this is one of the Greatest horror games ever made, quite frankly it's scarier than F.E.A.R. 1. The biggest plus about this game is the melee combat, it's freaking awesome, Yea, this game has fun melee combat like Dark Messiah of Might & Magic. If you wanna feel like you living in a Crime thriller horror movie, then this is the game for you. I love this game!
 | Хорошая игра: за сюжетом интересно следить ( а ещё сос мыслом), классная атмосфера, неплохая милишная боёвка от первого лица и хороший артдизайн. ИИ так же как и в FEAR тут просто нереальный! Противник всегда пытается окружить, отступает если сильно огрёб, меняет оружие и старается нападать исподтишка. Игра всегда держит в напряжении и не даёт расслабиться. На одном из уровней даже есть момент — тебе надо подняться по лестнице а наверху жёсткий замес с холодным оружием и стрельбой. И вот думаешь, а надо ли мне это? :D У ботов так же есть френдлифаер, они могут начать меситься друг с другом, что вообще радует! Но всё же в современных реалиях игра уже устарела. Левелдизайн мне не понравился и ощущается старомодным, в геймплее не хватает разнообразия и графика тоже уже не блещет. Всё равно советую поиграть, за 6-7 часов прохождения минусы не успеют надоесть, а плюсы остаются :) | Solid game but release is very buggy and gameplay is dull"
76561197999259031,203750,Binary Domain,0.0,Action,0,"such a fascinating game made in such a weird time. im surprised it plays this well
i feel like i am doing archeology digging up a old high production game that got memory holed out of existence.
what makes this game so obscure? is it genuinely just a mediocre third person shooter from the gears of war era?

I don't think so, maybe this Is just one of those weird games I vibe with. Its kinda like the same feeling I get with vanquish, the lost planet games and earth defence force. its that feeling where somewhere in the late 2000's during japans culture boom you had these studios try to make something for the western market and the result is this interesting fusion of ideas where these two styles of gaming and aesthetics clash and that is just fascinating to me.

the actual game itself is pretty fun too, unfortunately there isn't much I can say about it but it all comes together when you are the one controlling it.

it made me get existential about the disappearance of art in the public consciousness, not the games fault its just that I feel bad playing something this interesting and well produced but at the same time its completely unknown and forgotten. well i noticed you binary domain, i appreciated you.


7.8/10 | takes almost 1 hr to setup controller , and still doesn't work with controller some main bindings are not work,vibrations are also doesn't work. even sometimes you cannot play with mouse and keyboard don't waste your money in this one.finding numerous results on internet but none of those are worked,i brought this because i see his style is like gears of war but this game inputs are very bad maybe gear of war is gears of war none of game take his place. | The way the robots get destroyed by part is really fun. You can shoot the legs off, the arms off, or the head off so that they attack friend and foe. Sadly the bosses are quite boring (on several you just stand around until someone brings explosives or something to handle them. Shooting them is a waste of bullets seemingly), and there could be a bit more enemy variety.

The game runs fine but if you play with controller you have to rebind the face buttons (ABXY) and turn on the setting to show the button prompts rather than keyboard ones. | This is a neutral review. 

Binary Domain is a mediocre sci fi shooter/action game where you have to save the world from over zealous AI. So the story is ok. The characters and dialogue are ok but nothing memorable. I liked how you can upgrade not only your gear ( main weapon, resistances, gadgets ) but also the gear of the companions. 

It's not precise to define this game as FPS only. It's actually a hybrid between a shooter and an action game (Prince of Persia style). There are parts of the game where it plays like a classic FPS, and parts where you have to pass certain scripted action sequences. The game is non stop action. It never has a dull moment, so yes it's adrenalinic, but it's also frustrating. Why frustrating? 

Because this is a console port. Binary Domain was primarily made for XBOX and Playstation, and later for PC. Combat, game mechanics and everything else are clearly optimized for consoles and for a game controler, and NOT for keyboard and mouse. That fact brings many little problems that are frustrating but luckily do not prevent game completion. Examples: 
- the key buttons for sprinting and for taking cover is the same. Often when I would have to flee from a difficult enemy the main character would take cover over and over instead of running away from danger. Often it would mean defeat and re-loading. 
- the key buttons for the special power and for reloading weapon is the same. That means everytime you want to use your special power the main character reloads the weapon, which consumes ammo very quickly. And ammo is limited of course. 
- Some times in the scripted action sequences it wasn't clear what I had to do to pass them. The game didn't make clear enough what buttons to use ( it showed some strange symbols, maybe for game controllers ), so I would often frantically button mash until I would understand what is required of me. So the game mechanics and controls are poor, archaic. 
- there is a fight when you are in control of a goliath robot and have to repel enemies that come from all sides. They didn't optimize mouse sensitivity well so it was very slow to turn the cannon 360 degrees. So I had to retry until I was able to find the right sequence of turning left or right in order to kill enemies before they killed me. 
Those are just a few examples or how this game is not optimized for a PC. 

I liked the game in the beginning, then when you hit midgame it practically becomes a non stop boss fight. Some boss fights are objectively hard and frustrating. They revolve around targetting the only weak spot the bosses have. And since the bosses move around quickly it's not easy to hit those spots ( and minions do spawn contantly ). There was especially one incredibly brutal boss fight that nearly made me quit the game. So I went to youtube to see the only way it can be done. 

I also didn't like how the game experiments with voice commands. The companions from time to time ask you questions and the game expects you to answer vocally. But voice recognition wasn't implemented properly. You can switch to key button replies but it also doesn't work well, and you have limited time to answer. If you fail to answer you lose influence with companions, and influence is important story wise. You also lose influence if you accidentally shoot them - and that happened often, not because of my mistakes, but because they would often stand and run between me and the enemies. Also they get angry and decrease ""faith"" in you randomly if you don't play fights perfectly enough, which annoyed me. 

To conclude, it's fun but also full of little frustrating imperfections due to it being a console port. It's also a little ridiculous how they blatantly copied many elements of Mass Effect 1. | God I love this game, it's hilarious, fun, and awesome. I have nostalgia from the time of playing it in the PS3, it's still just as fun as before."

[b][i]Loot Rascals[/i] is in the genre of puzzle-roguelikes.[/b] And yes, you read that right - this is a [i]like[/i] in the sense that it is true turn-based gameplay. Brilliantly done, I may add. You actually move in real-time, but whenever you cross into another hex, a turn passes. There are very short day/night cycles that determine if you get first hit on an enemy. You will instantly kill the enemy if your power is greater than his 'strength' or HP. All the math is transparent, and there are only like three numbers to keep track of which makes it quite elegant. This is where the puzzle portion comes in, and fits it nicely in the puzzle-roguelike genre along other titles such as [i]HyperRogue[/i], [i]The Depths of Tolagol[/i], and even [i]Crypt of the Necrodancer[/i], among others. 

[b]Yes, it is brutally hard - but more importantly - it is hella addicting.[/b] I have a hard time putting it down.

The other notable part is that there is a built in card game of sorts. The loot you collect from fallen foes is cards. The cards give you buffs depending on how you lay them out. It's all simple to learn, yet slowly reveals its depth as you figure it all out. The only other part that you may want to know is that there are no meta-game upgrades. There is a pseudo-multiplayer component, but so far I haven't found it potent enough to really matter one way or the other.

[b]Pros:[/b]
+Awesome artwork and music and just such a zany universe
+Surprisingly addictive, and it is so easy to just fall into another run
+Keyboard and mouse support is great, and so is controller support
+Daily runs and leaderboards certainly keep things fresh
+Both the turn-based combat system and collectable card game are *really* well done

[b]Cons:[/b]
-Yeah, it's brutal, but hey thats what we came for
-I do wish you could play with keyboard only, but no biggie

[b]A must-own for anyone who enjoys turn-based roguelikes.[/b] | It's a crime that more people are not playing this.

Learning enemies, the ins-and-outs of the card system, and using all the tools made available to try and survive has been a blast so far. Very difficult, but playing well feels rewarding. It's more of a puzzle game than anything else. Take your time, use the day/night cycle to your advantage and get all the loots! You rascal you!

独创的卡槽装备特效，例如：奇数位卡槽攻击+1，所有左边卡槽效果+2等，我觉得在玩法的新奇的同时，此游戏是一个非常好的[strike]早教类游戏[/strike]。因为你要考虑合理搭配奇偶数效果卡牌使数值最大化，运用的小学数学基础比某花钱租卡类卡牌游戏不知道高到哪里去了。
种类还算足够的怪物类型，和怪物死亡动画，看得出来制作组的用心。
对新手友好，不需要高难度的操作，上手很快，基本上过完教程就能玩了。
BGM可有可无，不过还算耐听。

You build a little town, making your build choices differently based on variations in the layout of the terrain and the victory point conditions that vary in each play-through. It is consistent enough to appeal to (former) chess player in me, but random enough to be exciting and new each time. Random cards and ""dice"" (types of ""people"" you can use each turn to take various actions) keep it exciting, forcing tactical adjustments every turn, but largely without upsetting your larger strategy.

It has its limits. Once you have really mastered it (I am 5th on the leaderboards) it is pretty much done. You cannot play it 20 totally different ways for 10 years like the best Civ-type games of all time. But the subtleties of tactics and strategy are absolutely fantastic to figure out along the way despite what look like incredibly simple mechanics. So it is an wonderful puzzle game wrapped in a tactical game that is wrapped in a builder game. While I am pretty much done with it, it will stay in my memory as one of the best games I have ever played.

 | Right now, Axes and Acres is half off for the Winter Sale, and I think that $4.99 is a fair price for what this is: a digital version of a typical European board-game.  It's not an American board-game, so it plays more like ""Settlers of Catan"" than ""Candyland.""  That means it's complicated at first, though it's very easy to learn if you watch TomChick's video of him playing it.  For what it is, it had the potential to be a great game: you build up your little hamlet from scratch each game, building houses, farms, guardhouses, town halls and so forth, and your peasants farm, chop trees, mine stone and reproduce, a game mechanic that requires two pawns instead of one for some inexplicable reason.  (Because your pawns aren't people, they are tiny dice-shaped figurines, so maybe they have one gender, or six.  I don't know.)

Anyway, the game is a lot of fun when you're playing it.  You only have so many dice each turn and only so much food, so you have to decide whether to build or farm and so forth.  Each game has random goals, such as ""Build 5 roads"" or ""Kill 3 barbarians"" and you have to work towards those goals in a set amount of turns.

And here is where the game goes from being great to being a near miss.  For some inexplicable reason, the game designers decided that foisting a super-complicated European-style digital board-game that has no real-world board game equivalent to it on an unsuspecting American teenage Steam populace would make these people go ""Oh, this is too complicated!  Make it harder!"" and so they decided that every time you win, the game would keep track, for every victory you would gain a Level, and the game would roughly subtract one turn for each victory.  So, if you are given 25 turns to win at Level 1, you only get 24 turns at Level 2, and 23 turns at Level 3.  

Now if you're great you may get to Level 50, if you're terrible you may get to Level 4, but at some point, every single person who plays will reach a maximum level where they can't go any higher, and so for them the game becomes an exercise in futility.   If you lose two games in a row, you lose a Level and gain back a turn, so you might rise to Level 50, lose 10 games and end up at Level 45.  I don't see this as a good thing, as you gain nothing.  

In various rogue-like and tower-defense games, you have a meta-game, where even if you lose terribly each game, you are still gaining gold, cards, skills or whatever, and so there is compensation for the game getting tougher.  ""Solar Settlers"" by the same company is a good example: you get cards permanently every time you play, and thus the entire game makes more sense and is always fun to play. 

So, I do recommend this game on sale.  It's worth playing for the 10 or 20 hours you'll get out of it before you find it frustrating and futile. | My favourite game of 2016.

Plays like a town building worker placement board game with some deck building on the side.

You are racing to meet your Victory Point target before you run out of turns. If you are successful you move on to the next phase where you keep all the infrastructure you have built, but the actions which give you Victory Points change. After you beat all three phases you win the map and increase one rank.

Each rank you go up increases the number of Victory Points required to beat the next map, however if you lose two maps in a row your rank decreases by one. This does a really good job of making sure things never get too hard or too easy for you. | Fun single player board game that gets slightly more difficult each time you win.

Elements of Worker Placement, Dice Rolling, Victory Point engine building, Light deckbuilding.

Would recommend for fans of Agricola, Empire, or even Civilisation. | These days it's extremely rare to see an original game design within the realm of video games. It's also hard to find elegant strategy games that are easy to learn and unfold their depth by the combination of relatively straight-forward rules. Axes and Acres delivers on both fronts!

The game resembles an economic solitaire board game, but uses the digital format to take full advantage of randomization (map, cards, goals, dice) to keep every playthrough fresh. All of the randomness happens before the player is making decisions though and can be mitigated in various ways, so it never feels unfair but more like a set of conditions you have to make the best out of every turn. 

On top of that, the game uses a ranking system to dynamically adjust the difficulty to the player's skill every match. It's a feature far too few single-player games use.

All in all this is, so far, probably the most interesting game I've played this year."

Wem bei Roblox's schon vom Zuschauen schwindlig wird, der dürfte sich in Istrolid sofort zuhause fühlen. Die einzelne Einheit ist hier nichts als ein winziges Zahnrädchen im 
Getriebe unserer Kriegsmaschinerie und will ganz bestimmt nicht auf Sekunde und Pixel 
genau manövriert werden. 

Wenn riesige Divisionen über noch riesigere Karten walzen, liegt der strategische Anspruch 
woanders: 

Wir müssen schlaue Angriffsrouten planen, dem Feind in die Flanke fallen, seine Streitmacht 
mit der Zusammenstellung unserer eigenen kontern.! Ziel ist immer, möglichst viele der 
Ressourcenpunkte einzunehmen, die ähnlich wie in Company of Heroes über die ganze Karte 
verstreut sind. Wer davon mehr hält als der Gegner, dessen Siegpunkte ticken langsam bis
zum Triumph nach oben. 

Istrolid ist also kein Spiel für Basenbastler, hier steht ständiges Expandieren auf dem Plan.
Das funktioniert auch richtig gut und sorgt für spannendes Tauziehen. 

Selbst gegen die KI, die überraschend gnadenlos spielt und uns wirklich fordert. 
Die Wirtschaft funktioniert übrigens - wie könnte es anders sein - wie in Supreme Commander: 
Solange wir mehr pro Sekunde fördern, als unsere aktiven Bauprojekte vom Konto saugen, 
lassen wir einen endlosen Raumschiffstrom vom Stapel. 

Titanische Materialschlachten sind also vorprogrammiert.! ;) | awesome game. saw video's of people playing it. I was immediately hooked. The campaign has the right amount of challenge and levels. forcing the player to think outside the box and change up their ships or optimize micro managing. 

haven't tried the multiplayer yet. I'm kinda late to the party here. but seeing how you can use AI is really cool. program a ship to prioritize certain tactics in a battle. 

1 minor complaint is that you can't add any of the dlc items to your ships in the campaign mode. I can understand some of the shaded stuff, but the insignia's and stripes to make your ships more unique? That should be changed.  Also its kinda hard to keep ships symmetrical. | Its a decent game. The campaign is also the tutorial. I spent almost a year playing it. 

Pro
1_Get to build your own ship.
2_Ai System for the ships.
3_There's multiple player mode. 3v3/ 2v2/ 1v1.
4_Moderator are usually on
5_Regular  updates.
6_Balance weapons. 
7_Its Free.

Con
1_Theres essentially one game mode. 
Which is one team vs another team in captureing points/flags.

2_Matching making isnt balanced. It gets decided by the host.
For example if the host has a full 3 pros  on their team, the host can let 3 new players in the opposite team.
Basically a slaughter fest.

3_Match Making is also very messy due to the multiple lobby that is generate but often stays on even when there isnt players in them. 

4_The last one is managble but when the theres too many ship in play during a 3v3 crashes often.

Heres some way they can fix the game. 
1_Make sure each player finishes campaign before they can play multiplayer mode.
2_Revamp the match making system to 10 lobby max. So people always run into another player.
3_Add in another game mode.
4_Limit the amount of ship that can be build for 3v3 so you guys can managed the server stress level.

It's a card game where you play it like a board game and it's up to you to predict what your opponent is going to do and try to react accordingly. 

The most unique part of this game is that you play FOUR cards at ONCE. Every turn, both players! And there's no mana. If that doesn't get you at least interested, I don't know what to say.

People talk about grind in f2p, (which is what put me off of HS) and grind is part of RuneScape, so that label almost put me off of this game. Which I think happened to a lot of people, and that's a shame. 

If you're looking for a fun, free-to-play card game with some twists and isn't a chore, here it is. | C'est dommage ce jeu avait tout pour se démarquer :
- un système de jeu original différent réellement des autres TCG
- une ambiance originale
- des cartes bien équilibrées offrant des possibilités de decks vraiment très nombreuses
- une économie saine pas de pay to win, de vrais boosts réguliers pour les f2p ou juste ceux ne désirant pas lâcher leur salaire tous les mois dans des boosters

Mais :
- Jagex a presque été silencieux depuis le début, et n'a quasiment fait aucune promo, et n'a organisé aucun tournoi (TCG = esport et spectacle en streaming de nos jours, sans ça il y a vraiment une perte de valeur)
- n'a quasiment rien ajouté depuis sa sortie
- a laissé traîné des sales bugs sans s'en occuper et qui au bout d'un an de jeu deviennent plus qu'horripilants
- a fini de tuer ma motivation avec l'ajout de bonus f2p obligeant à se connecter tous les jours sans en rater un seul... (quasiment tous les éditeurs ont compris que les gens avaient une vie à côté des TCG et qu'il pouvait arriver qu'on ne se connecte pas pendant plus de 24h, me^me pour récupérer un bonus... d'autant que ce système à la noix est un système de f2p mobile qui s'y adapte beaucoup car on peut ouvrir ces jeux et récupérer les bonus en speed entre deux portes même si on n'a pas le temps de jouer...)

En gros, pendant longtemps, j'ai recommandé ce jeu, mais aujourd'hui un constat doit être fait...
Le jeu est plus ou moins à l'abandon, la communauté, même si motivée ne fait que rétrécir, et aucun effort ne semble vouloir être fait pour résoudre les anciens bugs et planifier le futur.

It's an RTS, but without combat.
It's a base building game without many structures.
It's a colony sim, where colonists don't really matter.
It's a business sim where hostile takeovers is the goal.

I guess if any of those things sounds good, then get this game, but if you're here for the normal feel of any of those genres stay FAAAR way.

You build your base near good resources and then pray one of the bots won't claim those resources away from you.
Because when that happens you have no way of reclaiming them.
Add the fact that this game balances the difficulty by giving the bots higher stats (thus making the bot always pick resources to claim before you) and you get a game where you can loose within first 5 minutes of the game with no way of preventing it nor fighting back.
After you survive your first 5 minutes, next you have to sell resources, hoping that the RNG will decide that the resource that you are producing is going to be worth anything.

This is not a strategy game, because there is no strategy, your win or loose is decided 100% by luck and luck alone."

Cheating AI to compensate for being bit dumb is common practice in RTS games, but apparently the devs think that their AI is stupid beyond any redemption so they juiced all the cheating levers to the moon and the only thing that remains is artificial difficulty in the most boring and tedious way.

Raiding/attacking an AI is absolutely pointless unless you can actually destroy their main base. They're barely relying on population for their production and any villagers/military units you kill respawn almost instantly anyway so it's absolutely pointless to raid them.

The issue seemed a bit less apparent during the Campaign, so at least that part was bit better balanced. But trying out Conquest mode afterwards is just absolutely disgusting. It's doable, but an absolute drag cause it requires constant micromanagement to barely compensate for all the AI cheating. And even then it takes so long to finish off an opponent because raiding an AI does barely anything, so unless you're way way stronger the AI will just bounce back in the blink of an eye.

Bit of cheating would be fine, but I mean the AI units literally respawn like 2-3+ times faster, and their armies have barely any upkeep so it doesn't matter if you destroy their economy cause they will just field an army of 15+ units without any economy supporting them anyway. It's just a joke imo, this is not an actual challenge.

Please put some actual thought and at least a little bit of effort into your AI so the cheating doesn't have to be so blatantly in your face. 

It's a shame, cause the base game mechanics are interesting enough, the game looks nice visually and has a good theme. The campaign is decent and multiplayer might be fine, but beyond that the AI is a hot broken mess preventing you from having any fun. | Стратегия неплохая, особенно с друзьями, но отдельные кланы за 200 рублей каждый и сама игра которая стоит 1100 это конечно писдец.

当Paradox开始重视国内市场、请各up大做宣发的时候，我以为中国这么大的市场可以让它给中国地区的势力更丰富的内容和更强力的游戏体验，结果于今天看，这只是一种臆想。

76561197999259031,379720,DOOM,22.483333333333334,Action,14,"[h1]DOOM Review: A Masterclass in FPS Revival[/h1]

DOOM is nothing short of a triumphant return to form for one of gaming’s most iconic franchises. From the moment you tear through your first demon, it’s clear that this game isn’t just a reboot—it’s a love letter to the original while boldly forging its own path.

The gameplay is fast, fluid, and unapologetically brutal. The emphasis on movement and aggression creates a relentless pace that’s as exhilarating as it is empowering. Glory kills add a visceral layer of satisfaction, rewarding you for diving headfirst into the action instead of cowering behind cover. This isn’t just another FPS; it’s a pure, adrenaline-fueled experience that reminds you why shooters became so popular in the first place.

The level design is another standout feature, with sprawling, labyrinthine maps that encourage exploration without ever losing momentum. Hidden secrets, upgrades, and collectibles provide plenty of incentives to comb through every corner of the UAC’s Mars facility and the hellish depths beyond.

Mick Gordon’s thunderous soundtrack deserves a special mention. The heavy metal score doesn’t just accompany the gameplay—it amplifies it. Each riff and beat syncs perfectly with the chaos, driving you further into the carnage.

The story is refreshingly simple yet surprisingly effective. It knows it’s not the main attraction and instead focuses on delivering just enough lore to keep things interesting. The Doom Slayer’s disdain for protocol and corporate nonsense injects a layer of humor that contrasts beautifully with the dark, gritty setting.

Visually, DOOM is stunning. The environments are detailed and atmospheric, while the demon designs are grotesque in the best way possible. Every battle feels like it’s taking place in a heavy metal album cover brought to life.

In conclusion, DOOM isn’t just a great game—it’s a reinvention of a genre that many thought had lost its edge. It’s fast, ferocious, and endlessly fun. Whether you’re a long-time fan of the series or a newcomer, this is one hell of a ride you don’t want to miss.

Rating: 9/10. | DOOM é frenético, rápido e divertido. Para os veteranos que se lembram do original, é um mimo nostálgico imperdível.

Es muy simple, con una mecánica original y dinámicas directas: uso una carta que solo se responde con una carta y listo.

Pros: 
- Una mecánica de juego de cartas muy interesante, te hace salir de los TCG normales para entrar en un verdadero juego de cartas de estrategia.
- El apartado visual está muy bien cuidado para dar una sensación de era medieval muy completa.
- Fácil de aprender y muy profundo para explorar.

Cons:
- El peor tutorial de la historia. Literalmente quiere contarte cómo jugar mediante una historia, que se olvida totalmente de explicarte el juego... El tutorial debería ser 1 sola partida que te dice qué hace cada carta y listo, pero pierde un monton de tiempo explicandote estrategias antes de decirte cómo funciona el juego.

Since it's free and it's decent i suggest you try it. It personally gave me 2 good hours of gameplay.

players get a wide array of clothing and armour to choose from, allowing for an astronomical number of combinations thanks to absolver's nine equipment slots (head, elbow, shoulder, inner top, outer top, hand, waist, leg and foot). lots of asymmetrical pieces, pleasant colours and often loose-fitting clothes make this game's fashion style stand out.

absolver has a beautiful watercolour-like art style, depicting old structures that have seen better days, calm forest paths, massive temples and highly refined, decorated and gilded environments. sadly, there's little to explore, but what is there is dense in detail and looks amazing.

all of the environments feature detailed soundscapes, from birds singing to machinery moving, from wood creaking to cave ceilings dripping. the environmental soundscapes are complemented by the game's minimalist original soundtrack, featuring lots of different string instruments, blending flamenco, arabic and indian sounding melodies, a few woodwinds, bells and chimes and some nice percussive rhythms to match the rhythm of fights. a final note on the audio side of things, fights sound great. the impact sounds for punches and bashing weapons are heavy. the cutting sounds for swords are okay. these are sort of hard to get right because blades don't make much noise as they cut through flesh, except for when they hit a bone, so knowing how difficult it is to represent cutting sounds, i'll give them a pass.

heavy recommend. | Absolver игра которая восхищает своим подходом к геймплею, и в тоже время огорчает ограниченностью контента. 
Игровой процесс поставлен хорошо, особенно для любителей боевых искусств, вы можете изучать приемы, сражаться в рукопашную с врагами, устраивать дуэли, составлять комбинации приемов.

I love the battle deck mechanic I don't need to remember what buttons to press to perform a certain move you just put it in the deck and press one button and your good. The fighting is very satisfying, the hits feel good. The way you learn new moves is great in my opinion it makes you feel like a actual martial artist. I wish more games had fighting mechanics like this. I would love to see more games like this in the future | underated little indie game, once upon a time there was an online playerbase but now its pretty much solely single player

It still doesnt have p2w features at all. The things u can buy with jewels doesnt give u any benefits for the pvp (so the fights are fair) but money can be spend to get some stuff a little faster or for some costumes. Also there are a many Achievements, Arena Rankings and Quests where u can get alot (really alot) free jewels again and again. Yes, no limitation, u just need to play active to earn it.Very friendly monetization.

If u are a new player, it could be a little difficult to get in to all the new stuff and how it works. Maybe u will even think thats to difficult or would need to long grind until u get on the same lvl as ""older"" player, but thats not true at all. The last updates made it so much easier for new players to gear up, u just need to know how (just ask ppl and u will get help!). Also dont forget its a mix of rpg and moba, so some ppl spend some time on their equip and know how to fight. If u would be on same lvl as them after a few days, the rpg aspect would feel bad.  :-D 

And here comes also the good community to the point. Alot of ppl in the game are very friendly und help the new ppl who have questions. There is also a Forum, Reddit and the best thing Discord server, where u can speak to other players even if u are currently not ingame or if they are not ingame. In the game there are 3 nations that fight each other, but in discord ppl are still helpfull to each other (hope it stays like that^^). Also dont forget to check the official forum, there are alot of usefull guides about the game.

The game had a rough start and lost alot of playerbase, but alot of the problems were fixed and it is now growing with new content, balance changes and other stuff. So dont understand me wrong, Crush has still some topics that need to be worked on but thats something Devs and GMs are already working on now, just need some time. The game is very special and has alot of awesome features, that u will maybe not see or understand as a new player, but some mechanics are really deep and brings alot of fun when u get to know them.

Just dont listen to the haters with 0,1h playtime. Crush Online is f2p, so better make ur own opinion, it could be worth it. | Well, I played this game since October. The game has everything to be a potential game....
but unfortunately its DEAD, there is no players to do PVP once the mainly thing to do is the PVP/ARENA...
Developers are too worried about other priorities and not putting/fixing whats necessary to populate this game and make it more interested for players.

Season 2 patch at the moment is a disappointment, new sets are useless, the game didn't change at all, still the same boring stuffs, nothing to do, new player come and leave.

I'm not recommending this game right now but maybe with future patch it can become good | Once you learn how to play CrushOnline it is fun and challenging.  Use your skills to help your faction gain control over the map. Craft Gear, weapons and compliment your stats using a well done artifact grading system to achieve your play style. Pve or Pvp and spark a war that could ignite up to a 15v15 battle. Be prepared to test your skills! Did I mention duel spec, stat combinations are well done.

I like both, Warhammer and 4x games. However, the depth isnt there anywhere near the level I expect from a 4X game, while on the other hand, the action isnt as high paced, as I would want it from a Warhammer game.

Someone else described it as a cross between Terraria and the Elder Scrolls games (the earlier ones especially), and I'd say the comparison is pretty apt.

The open sections give you the freedom to dig / chop / build to your heart's content in a 2D world, like Terraria. The storied sections have you running around completing quests, chatting to NPCs, and generally killing with whatever arsenal of weapons and magic you feel like, much like the Elder Scrolls games.

Is it as good as either of them? No, of course not. Terraria has had many, many years to get to where it is today, and TES has all the resources of Bethesda.

RoM is the first game made by a small indie dev, and it shows. Both in the rough edges, and in the love that was poured in to making it. It is imperfect, but endearing nonetheless. Like Terraria was in the early days.

I definitely got my money's worth, and with a (free) remake version in the works, plus a sequel down the track, I look forward to coming back to the Realms of Magic in the future. | Progress and advancement seems to be more tied to doing fetch quests rather than resource gathering and exploring. That's not really what I want when I play these games. I like getting powerful by grinding... And while you can do that, it just doesn't feel as satisfying because you do a quest and then you literally get the gear for free that you just grinded for. After a few quests like that, it makes you not want to grind, which for me takes away any play-ability. If you are fine with that, then you might like this game. I didn't so I can't recommend. | Great blend of Terraria and a very simple Skyrim.  More people should be supporting this game! | ТЕРРАРИЯ $O$AТЬ

TL;DR - It's an excellent game, well worth the price of admission. Everything seems to work, and work well.

This is a very simple to learn RTS, with good level design (thus far), a pretty good base mechanic, and a brilliant art style (literally and figuratively, the lighting is a bit intense).

The basic premise is that you control a constantly-spawning highly mutable lifeform, and by taking and holding various points around the map you gain access to different sets of abilities for your units. Basic units spawn at a constant rate, and the biggest challenge lies in determining what to turn them into and where to attack. Resource management boils essentially down to ""how long do I wait before expanding"", which is a simple enough thing to measure.

The good stuff:

As I've said, the art design is excellent. Seriously, everything is pretty clear in its function at a glance and the game looks gorgeous.

It's got a really intuitive interface. Even novice RTS players should be able to pick this up and figure out just about everything extremely easily.

Speedy matches aren't something I'm used to in any RTS. It's nice to be able to knock out a quick game or two instead of an hours-long slog sometimes.

It's quickly engaging, and the additional features that are supposed to make that even better.

The downsides:

If you're looking for something with a lot of depth, look elsewhere. There aren't lots of resources to juggle, there's no campaign, it is exactly what it appears to be.

It's really heavy into micromanaging units for a sizeable portion of each game. Towards the end it can get a bit more macro, but misplacing half a dozen guys (not tough to do) can have pretty dire consequences early on.

Momentum is massively important. This isn't a negative thing necessarily, but it becomes pretty clear pretty quickly who has the advantage in a battle. It's possible to come back if you're behind, but there's an obvious tipping point.

You can't control units while you're zoomed out. That's a bit of an odd design decision and I'm sure there's a reason for it, but it's a little bit frustrating.

All in all this is extremely well done, and for the price you seriously can't beat it for entertainment value. | A nice concept, but very sloppy execution.

You control swarm type units and use them to assimilate and eliminate the enemy. You have places where base units are produced and these can be converted to other units for a rock paper scissors advantage. Main problem is controlling the units and their behavior. Controls are very clunky, movement and positioning isnt easy. The behavior of your units is also very inconsistent. When you position your units they may or may not decided to attack the nearby enemy. Sometimes they dont retaliate when youre attacked at all. Such bad control and bad Ai ruin the game.

Playing the campaign there are several types of mission. The puzzle types, where you need to use a limited number of units correctly or the eliminate enemy ones, where you need to produce the right amount of units to defeat the enemy. Sometimes you have a goal, like escort or gathering a certain amount of base units at a building. Variety is decent, I must say.

Story seemed kind of weird and the presentation element is simple.

The main selling point of this game is the gameplay. And its tedious. Thats why I wont recommend this to the majority of people. It turns into a slog for the most part due to the bad controls and weird AI.
This was for singleplayer, by the way. I dont know how the multiplayer is, but I doubt the issues are better there.

As of the time of the review, here's a number of issues which need to be addressed by the game
[olist]
[*] Game will randomly hang when attempting to start a new practice game. Other players have reported this also occurs when attempting to start a normal game.
[*] The way the AI plays cards is unfair due to the simultaneous play mechanic; the AI has a tendency to play wait several moments into a turn's main phase, then play all their cards at once, making it very difficult for human players to read and respond to any individual action taken by the AI, which also causes problems because of the short timer.
[*] The Initiative system determines who attacks first during combat, and is governed by who played a card or activated an ability last; unfortunately, this does not work well with the way AI plays its cards all at once, because the player either plays all their cards early and end up being unable to respond to anything the AI does in order to keep initiative, or the player waits for the player waits for the AI to play all their cards and loses initiative every time.
[*] Individuals have to decide which enemy to block before attackers are known, another problem of the simultaneous turn system.
[*] Draft system costs a investment of in-game currency or real money, but (A) it's dead and you can't play against AI, and (B) you don't keep the cards you draft.
[/olist]

Basically, you could say a huge problem of the game is its conceit that a simultaneous turn system is a good thing, when, as implemented, it's a huge hindrance. Ultimately, the central conceit of the game is either poorly implemented, or just a bad idea in the first place. | Excellent rts game. All the fun of MtG with about 1/4 the play time.

【第一印象】
发现这个游戏的时候是我真的闲的无聊看看免费游戏，结果就发现了！
本人很喜欢像素风（8-bit）的游戏！还有RPG类型的！
开始玩的时候，新手教程是“老练囚犯”，当时就觉得这个人物好好玩。
接着又打了几盘人机。电脑跟你打从来不怂的，1V3的时候经常有，开局一会儿就三杀了。每次死了一两次后都会想“要不我也像电脑那样不怂？试试看”，结果每次都是送送送……
最后一盘就是占领祭坛（反正我是这样叫的），每次都有电脑跑去站，然后我就一直骚扰，每次都把他打死在祭坛里面，还是占领不了……心疼自己智商。

【游戏趣味性】
1.像素风（8-bit）。如果有一点点信仰的玩家第一眼都会喜欢的吧。
2.游戏模式。稍微有一点点枯燥，就是杀杀杀，DieDieDie。希望官方以后出一点娱乐模式or剧情模式（就像RPG类做任务）~
3.关于游戏里的人物。三个（还是几个记不住了）周免人物，没有玩过的人物可以练练手。如果有自己很喜欢或者玩的很溜的人物，但是又只是周免的，可以考虑花一点点钱（比如“老练囚犯” 6R），买一个人物。如果所有英雄都喜欢或者玩的溜或者信仰充值或者单纯喜欢游戏或者想支持作者的可以买下40R的DLC！说真的40R的DLC不算贵！一顿饭钱~（我只是推荐大家花点小钱支持作者，并没有提倡说不吃饭买……）

【好评的理由】
1.免费游戏好伐？！这都不给好评？游戏素质也还算不错！
2.像素风（8-bit）这点就给很多信仰玩家加分！
3.很多人物，很耐玩。
4.电脑的智商在我的眼里还算蛮高的。
5.DLC40R良心好伐？不想花钱玩人物的也可以在游戏里刷游戏币买啊！
6.很多关卡、很多技能、武器，应该来说玩不腻。（上面我说的游戏模式枯燥指的是单纯杀杀杀枯燥啊……）
7.占的内存很少……300MB，对于我这种渣渣宽带来说so easy。
8.支！持！简！体！中！文！

【差评的理由】
1.服务器问题真的很大好伐。欧洲服务器300ping，到亚洲服务器直接到了600ping，突然感觉我是欧洲人了呢！（并不，还是非洲的）
2.人物、技能平衡性有点差。具体什么情况还是自己玩玩，就知道了。

【总结】
大概就差不多了~反正我很喜欢这个游戏，已经准备花钱购买人物了。
信仰充值。
玩这个游戏，走位很重要啊！！！蛇皮走位！！！拿象拔蚌去走位都可以！！！

毕竟作者花了这么多时间去做游戏，开放是免费的，也就只有DLC赚赚钱。还是一句话，支持作者，让作者有把游戏完善下去的动力！

【感谢。】

3.19.2017 修改评论。 | 運営にやる気があるようでこまめにアップデートされており、新キャラクターも短期間で多く追加され、不具合も改善され、キャラ相性はあるものの強キャラ弱キャラの差はそこまで感じず、公開初日からこのゲームを見ているが初期に比べるとかなり良ゲーになった。
しかし公開されて数日間サーバーの不具合によってオンラインに他の人の部屋が見えないという、オンライン専用ゲームにおいて致命的な不具合があったため最初にプレイ人数を獲得できなかったのが痛い失敗かと思われる。
その為今も人数が足りずチームランクマッチ戦がしにくくなっているが、個人ランクマッチやフリー部屋やドラゴン討伐部屋等は機能しているので十分楽しめる。

簡単にまとめると、

～良い点～
・良アップデートがこまめに行われる
・キャラクターが多い(2017/1/27現在15体)
・キャラバランスが良い
・不具合修正が早い
・全キャラに別コスチュームがある(アプデにより3つ以上あるキャラも)


～悪い点～
・不具合内容が致命的な物が多い(サーバー接続不可、壁に埋まる等)
・プレイヤーが少ない
・ドラゴン討伐の難易度が高い(人によってはやりごたえがあり良い点)
・対戦中に抜ける人が多い
・ゲーム内マネーが貯まり難い(最近はデイリーボーナス実装で少しは集めやすいかも？)

What got me the most was that you'll have to pay for the pack to unlock all the different characters instead of earning in-game money to purchase whichever hero you desired.

Але важко уявити, що в 2025 році ми все ще змушені бачити у світі ігор проросійські наративи. У новій версії гри розробники ""відзначилися"" черговим ігноруванням української локалізації та повного ігнорування української нації, яка переживає героїчну боротьбу за своє існування та незалежність.  

Анонс нового персонажа, цариці-душогубки, яка нав'язується як ""символ культури та просвітництва"", виглядає як зневага до мільйонів українців. Героізація імперіалістичної постаті — це не тільки обурливо, але й аморально в контексті війни та окупації, яку сьогодні переживає наша країна.  

Українці заслуговують на повагу в індустрії відеоігор, а не на спроби просувати імперський наратив під виглядом ""культурних цінностей"". Досить толерувати пропаганду! Вимагаємо повноцінної української локалізації, українських героїв і персонажів, які реально відображають нашу історію, культуру та боротьбу.

It's hard to believe that in 2025 we are still witnessing pro-Russian narratives in the gaming industry. In the latest version of the game, the developers once again ignored Ukrainian localization and completely erased the Ukrainian nation, which is heroically fighting for its survival and independence.  

The announcement of a new character, a tsarina-murderer being portrayed as a ""symbol of culture and enlightenment,"" is a slap in the face to millions of Ukrainians. Glorifying an imperialist figure is not only outrageous but also immoral in the context of the war and occupation Ukraine is enduring today.  

Ukrainians deserve respect in the gaming industry, not an attempt to promote imperial narratives disguised as ""cultural values."" Enough with the propaganda! We demand full Ukrainian localization, Ukrainian heroes, and characters that truly reflect our history, culture, and struggle. | este jogo é bom mas o próximo a 2K ta de sacanagem! nunca que vou pagar ! 350/650R$ num jogo de nicho!

Плюс это порт мобильный донатной игры. | Faeria is fun. Okay, I can see myself spending 10 more hours on fighting AI on Pandora Mode. I already spent 28 hours. The rest of the game depends if I can push myself over the skill cliff of deckbuilding, because it's really hard. I can recommend this game very easily. I get to max out the utility of every monster, every decision, and win a lot.

But let's go into the reasons why this game isn't successful. NOTE: I go against AI and don't really compete.
- Faeria looks like a typo to a lot of search engines. It's very close to Fairy.
- You don't get to walk around. Like every other trading card game, you battle and these battles can get lengthy. There's no rest stop besides staring at the card collection.
- The campaign mode is fighting random NPCs with one-liners and that's it. There's no story, no satisfying closures besides winning, no secrets to unlock beyond the loot boxes of cards. The boss battles do have that unfair advantage, but there's no extra flair to them so they still look like normal NPCs to fight. While you are building a card collection, most people won't feel the dopamine of progress.
- In a fair match, the tension is not there for a lot of mid games. You either steamroll or get steamrolled. This might be because I play very defensively and haven't touched the aggressive cards. This might also be b/c I don't play competitively. I like steamrolling, but variety is the spice of life.
- Most of us will never ever beat this game, because the hard challenges are really hard. Many games can split the difficulty into Easy Mode, Normal Mode, and Hard Mode. This game doesn't split those modes, it blends them all together (easy stuff first ofc) and you know, not everyone wants to play Hard Mode. Like I said, my next 10 hours are probably going to be Pandora Mode and ignore the rest of it.
- I've fallen into playing very defensively. Like I ALWAYS go for the faeria well on the first turn. This might be a me problem, but I feel like it's the strongest strat.

What is Pandora Mode? You build a random deck 1 card at a time and play 6 random NPCs in a FAIR match. And there's rewards for it.

But again, I like the game. But again, I like utilizing every card to the most of its ability, being very goal-orientated when I place new land, and then steamrolling my AI opponents."

As for the tutorial itself, it was thorough and explained things fairly well, BUT it didn’t feel like I learned how to truly play since I was simply told the rules and told what to play when. The tutorial is both very good and not a proper introduction to playing.

76561197999259031,531640,Eternal Card Game,64.73333333333333,"Casual, Massively Multiplayer, Strategy, Free To Play",1,"I've played Magic on and off my whole life and spent at least 1000 hours playing Hearthstone. I had MTGO since the very beginning, and Hearthstone since late 2013 near the end of the open beta. Eternal is the best online card game I've ever played. It combines the best aspects of Magic's strategic depth and Hearthstone's fast-paced accessibility while avoiding their flaws.
F2P
Magic will always be expensive because it's a tradable CCG with a reserve list of cards that can't be reprinted and expensive booster packs. Most cards lose tons of value when they rotate out of standard. MTGO is less expensive and more liquid than physical cards, but still expensive. Recently, Wizards have added features similar to other digital CCGs like treasure chests.
Hearthstone is ""F2P"" in name only. New players need to spend lots of money or time to earn a viable deck. Otherwise, enjoy scraping out wins with a crappy pile at rank 17. Rewards for winning games are meager. You can get big payoffs in Arena (where you don't get to keep the cards you draft)...if you're already an experienced player and/or lucky. Arena costs 1.5 packs to play with cards you don't own and win at least 1 pack of value. You don't keep the cards. New Arena players get trashed.
Eternal is truly F2P. The spoils of victory are frequent and generous. Each win either gives a treasure chest with gold and a card, or more gold and a better card, or even more gold holy shit and a booster pack. Each treasure chest has a chance of becoming a better treasure chest full of even better rewards. Single-player Gauntlet mode lets you face the AI for free to win big rewards. Forge and Draft are more expensive than HS Arena (2.5 and 5x pack price vs. 1.5x pack price), but you get to keep all the cards you draft in Forge and Draft modes while still winning big payoffs for playing well.
Magic is pay to play, try to recoup your losses later. Hearthstone is an evil slot machine that reluctantly hands out the goods. Eternal is a slot machine that always gives you something, but sometimes gives you something better, and occasionally gives you an all-expenses-paid trip to Hawaii.
Winner: Eternal
Gameplay and RNG
Magic is the deepest, most complicated, most strategically interesting CCG ever. Almost every type of card, zone and resource can be interacted with, during both players' turns. The mana system rewards intelligent deck building and decision making skills. However, the mana system has also been a constant thorn in its side. Mana screw and flood as well as color screw are a necessary evil of the game's design, and consistently ruin the experience and decide high-level matches. The mulligan system punishes you further for the crime of being unlucky. Magic Online makes no use of any digital-only design space (except Momir Basic) and the relief from shuffling physical cards. The metagame gets patched several times a year whenever the physical Banned and Restricted list is updated.
Hearthstone sidesteps resource problems with its mana system, but has different issues instead. It's a simplistic ""My turn, your turn"" game with a hard limit to how interesting and interactive it can be. The mana system means that instead of getting mana-screwed, you get tempo-screwed if you don't draw a 2 on turn 2, a 3 on turn 3, and so on. It's called Curvestone for a reason. Being able to attack anything directly means that losing the board first usually means losing the game. The mulligan system is good. Hearthstone explores digital design space, but leans overwhelmingly on random effects. The RNG is so hilariously pervasive that even top-level players meme about it on a constant basis. Omnipresent powerful random effects make situations that are impossible to play around. It's one thing to get outplayed, but it feels awful to get outlucked. HS is the game of getting outlucked. Also, the meta is prone to getting extremely stale as Team 5 moves very slowly to nerf problem cards and very rarely buffs weaker ones.
Eternal simplifies the essence of Magic's strategic, interactive gameplay. You can still interact on your opponents' turns and there's plenty of powerful spot and mass removal (at common and uncommon, even!) to deal with tall and wide boards. The mana and combat systems are similar to Magic's. Eternal mitigates bad opening hands by allowing you to redraw a 7 card hand with between 2-5 mana cards, guaranteed. Flood and screw are still possible, but not nearly as frequently as in Magic. The combat system is much more interesting less blatantly aggressive than Hearthstone's, with different advantages given for attackers and defenders. Eternal makes excellent use of digital design space. You can affect cards in any zone, some cards make copies of themselves when drawn, and card attributes will persist across different zones, resulting in creative combos. As far as the metagame, in the last few months Dire Wolf Digital has shown a willingness to alter cards and tune up the meta in a timely manner when certain strategies are revealed to be too oppressive or lacking in counterplay.
Winner: Magic for overall depth, Eternal for elegance and creativity with digital space.
Polish and Features
Magic Online is the laughingstock of the digital games world. However, it has many more features than HS, with a huge variety of formats available, a full-featured collection and deck manager, and the ability to trade tickets cards with bots other players.
Hearthstone is a beautiful experience with compelling graphics, music, animations and voice acting. However, it possesses a few game modes (casual, ranked, arena, tavern brawl) with only two formats for now (wild and tavern brawl). It possesses extremely few features despite its obscene profitability and years post-release. There is no tournament mode and the deck and collection managers are very weak.
Eternal's art direction, sound design and graphical effects are better than Magic Online (like every other game) and worse than Hearthstone's (like every other game), but far closer to Hearthstone than to Magic Online. It only has two single player and two multiplayer modes. It has an intuitive, full-featured collection manager and deckbuilder with analytic tools to help guide deckbuilding.
Winner: Hearthstone for polish, Eternal for features.
Verdict
On the whole, Eternal refines and simplifies Magic's gameplay and creatively explores new design space while avoiding the egregious errors of Hearthstone. The gameplay finely balances a majority focus on skill with a pinch of luck. There is a wealth of interactions and strategies to explore. The online experience is elegant, enjoyable and full-featured. The game is generous with its rewards. You should stop reading this and install it right now. Why are you still reading this? Go away. Go play Eternal | Quick Review: Great Magic: The Gathering inspired digital CCG. Amazing UI, loads of features, brilliant draft system, and some truly awesome cards. But... as an MTG derivative, you have to be able to accept mana flooding/screwing.

Long Review:

I wanted to put some good hours into the game before reviewing (18 as of this post). I've completed the Tutorial Quests, four Forges, one draft and a ton of ranked games. Oh, and I've been playing Magic since Arabian Nights and Hearthstone since Beta.

To start, this is NOT Hearthstone. It is Magic the Gathering. Everything you know from Hearthstone doesn't apply here. You have to play ""power"" cards (mana/lands), so you need to know how to balance a deck. The system will try to do it for you and they start you out with a full set of 40 ""dual stones"", but to be good at the game you'll need to understand how to get the proper ratios. You also don't choose how you attack. You choose WHO attacks, and the opponent chooses blocks.

Once you accept that this is Magic on digitial steroids, you can really enjoy the game. Note: the initial tutorial quests are drudgery. Your decks suck and the mana ratios aren't great. They should really let you skip parts of this, but they don't. JUST PLAY THROUGH. It's worth it. You'll get a free Forge, which will net you a solid amount of packs and get you going.

The UI is AMAZING. You can get through games in 5 minutes and there is almost no waiting. Everything just works like you expect it to. WotC should hang its head in shame after seeing this.

There are a ton of cards for a first launch and lots of interesting deck ideas to build around. You could say that there are some balance issues - Black has a ridiculous suite of creature removal for a core set - but overall it does feel like every color have something truly special that it can do, and there are solid Aggro, Control and Combo strategies.

While I still love Hearthstone, I've been finding myself coming back to Eternal again and again, excited to play more. It's awesome and will be enjoyed by anyone who has played and enjoyed Magic at any time in their life. | Surement l'un des meilleurs, si ce n'est le meilleur jeu de cartes actuellement disponible sur le marché.

Il combine à lui seul tous les avantages qui sont présents sur ses concurrents directs. 

Ici il a très peu de places au RNG (comprenez à la chance), bien sûr il y en aura toujours sur ce type de jeu puisque cela reste un tirage sur plusieurs dizaines de cartes et si une carte tombe au bon moment dans une partie qui semble perdue cela peu la renversée.

Aspect également important, c'est que c'est un vrai free to play. On peut vite obtenir des cartes du seul Set disponible à l'heure actuelle. Tu farmes, tu suis les quêtes journalières, tu seras récompensé. Pour ceux qui détestent l'aspect versus contre d'autres joueurs, il existe des modes exclusifs contre l'IA (vous contre l'ordi en somme). C'est très intéressant pour des joueurs débutants qui veulent prendre leur temps sur chacun de leurs tours. Ici pas de chronomètre si vous mettez trop de temps a joué pour vous mettre la pression !

Seul point qui peut rebuter les joueurs non anglophones, le jeu n'est pas traduit en français a l'heure actuelle, mais rien de dramatique en cherchant un peu avec google tu vas pouvoir t'en sortir petit geek ! | + A interface é muito boa e intuitiva (cópia descarada do hearthstone);
- Uns diriam que o jogo é pay-to-win, mas quando na verdade é um pay-to-play como acontece em TODO cardgame da categoria, você não ganha por pagar mais, você paga para ter as cartas e ganha se souber jogar;
+ O jogo possibilita grindar as cartas muito facilmente, você ganha gold rápido além de ganhar cartas a cada vitória;
+ Os boosters vem com 12 cartas sendo uma delas rara/lendária, sendo assim você consegue fechar um playset de cartas de raridade mais baixa muito rápido, tendo que se preocupar apenas com as 'caras';
+ Existem MUITAS mecânicas e interações baseadas em magic, tornando o jogo muito mais competitivo e menos randômico (bom pra quem odeia o RNG do hearthstone);
+ Existem cartas chamadas 'fast spells' que são o equivalente das 'mágicas instantâneas' do magic, estas cartas possibilitam jogadas de resposta durante o turno do oponente;
+ Durante o combate, os jogadores escolhem apenas se atacam e com quais criaturas eles atacam, o jogador defensor escolhe se bloqueia e com quais criaturas ele bloqueia (semelhante ao mágic, diferente do hearthstone), ao meu ver isso possibilita a presença de mais criaturas de utilidade no deck (que possuem algum tipo de efeito que não seja apenas voltado ao combate) e meio que exige cartas de resposta do oponente para tais criaturas (removals), além disso as criaturas 'regeneram' o dano no final de cada turno, assim como acontece no magic;
+ O tutorial inicial do jogo é muito bom (não é nem um pouco chato) e te mostra boa parte das mecânicas além de te presentear com boas cartas, no final do tutorial você já ganha um deck de uma facção (cada deck já vem com uma lendária e o deck da facção das sombras tem uma lendária muito boa);

Só jogando pra ver mesmo, tanto para os jogadores de magic, quanto para os jogadores de hearthstone fica a dica deste jogo ;) | Jedna z większych niespodzianek wśród rosnącego ostatnio bardzo rynku karcianek. Spodziewałem się kolejnej karcianki a'la Hearthstone a tu taka niespodzianka! Dla mnie HS odpychał zbyt bardzo casualem, tutaj mamy już głebie zaczerpniętą z MtG. Tak dobrze słyszycie ta gra to wyśmienite połączenie Hearthstone z królem karcianek jakim jest Magic the Gathering. Oprócz standardowych trybów znanych z konkurencyjnych tytułów błyszczy szczególnie dobrze zanany fanom MTG tryb Draft. Najlepsze w tym trybie jak i trybie Forge(odpowiednik HS'owego ""drafta"") jest to, że karty które wybieramy dostajemy na zawsze!!! Inne plusy to duża ilość kart, możliwość tworzenia decków o dużej synergii na wzór też tych znanych nam z MTG, nie mamy wrażenia składania po prostu mocnych kart w jedną talie jak w HS. Gra mimo fazy wczesnego dostępu ma bardzo dużo contentu i jest ciągle rozwijana. Dodatkowo duża liczba graczy jaki, prężnie rozwijające się community tej gry powoduje, że wieszcze jej świetlaną przyszłość. Dajcie tej grze szanse a nie pożałujecie !!!"

Игра ссесионнная в очень интересном жанре. Получился некий франкенштейн слепленный из Total war: Arena, M&B, Dynasty Warriors и Kingdom under Fire. Суть игры в прокачке отрядов, которые выполняют ваши приказы на поле боя. Прокачка взята из выше упомянутой арены. Открывая разных юнитов и покупая для них снаряжение, вы также получаете доступ к новой экипировке для вашего героя.

На данный момент есть 3 режима.
1) PvP comand mode. Режим 5 на 5, где каждый герой выступает с одним отрядом.
2) PvP Team Deathmatch 10 на 10, без войск. Данный режим очень похож на M&B, но на мой взгляд сильно ему уступает.
3) PvE заскриптованная осада, в которой 1-5 игроков со своими отрядами штурмуют крепость с ботами.
Еще 2 режим сейчас тестируются. Это 15 на 15 аналог баттла из M&B. И 7 на 7 command mode.

Исторический период у этой игры примерно с 200 г.д.н.э по 200 г.н.э. Так называемая эпоха троецарствия в Китае.

Сейчас разберем сильные и слабые стороны этого проекта.
+ Неплохая графика.
+ Редкий, но очень интересный жанр.
+ Потенциал стать отличной соревновательно игрой.
+ Общение разработчиков с комьюнити. В стиме всегда ответят, прислушаются к советам и расскажут, что у них на повестке месяца. Уже реализовали некоторые из моих предложений.
+ Донат супер лайтовый. Я не вложил не копейки и заработал в игре около 10к голды, чего вполне достаточно на несколько лет вперед. Но закинуть шекелей, чтобы поддержать проект советую.
- Ранний доступ, соответственно: не хватает разнообразного контента, далеко не идеальный баланс, мало игроков на EU сервере.
- Физика немного страдает.
- Если у вас нет 8ми ядерного процессора, то в энд гейм ПвП на высоких настройках поиграть не выйдет (очень большое скопление юнитов в одном месте). 

Итог: в игру стоит играть, если вам интересно управлять одновременно и героем и войсками. Не стоит играть, если вы хотите клон M&B: warband ибо боевая система на данный момент смотрится слабее.

P.S. Все выше сказанное - сугубо личное мнение и не в коем случае, не является истиной в последней инстанции. | 才玩了一个多月，但是游戏时间已经有170多个小时记录在案。很喜欢！！！
和很多人一样，从骑砍过来的，因为等不了骑砍2（有生之年系列啊）。可是玩了这么久已经不想回去玩骑砍了。
好玩之处，良心之处，大家已经讲了很多了，就不再赘述，我是来提供反馈的！
尤其是新版本更新以后，赶紧玩了两天，有些痛点不得不提：
1.首先，给自己点赞，游戏有可能崩溃！出现过一次，贴吧吧友也反映遇到过这种情况。建议要么禁止自己给自己点赞，要么修复这个BUG。
【从上次发现这个bug到现在，崩溃情况没再出现过，目前看来已经修复】
2.其次，兵营现在的设定好像是，解散部队前必须补齐，没补齐的部队不能右键操作。但很多时候我们都是一只部队打到一定程度就不用了，正好最后一局废掉然后解散，现在弄得还得先补齐再解散，浪费银币啊！
另外没有补齐的部队也无法点击查看，每次点上去（无论左击右击）都是提示补兵，不太合理。
3.再者，不同等级的兵差别还是很大的，如果仅仅以低中高等级来划分，未免太粗糙了。经验池可以共享，但是战场上不要同时上呀！低级兵根本没法练了，在同阶高等级兵种面前全是炮灰！！！
就算非要划分成低中高级，也麻烦按升级次序标出12345678等级，方便玩家识别和选择。不然光记名字或者去升级树那边查看太麻烦了！
4.另外，10人战场改12人，打起来分的经验少了，导致全是抢人头抢经验。旗帜的晚出现，也让玩家初期没有了很好的拉锯战，而往往等到旗帜出现，一场战斗也接近尾声了，少了很多乐趣！
5.还有，强烈建议把讨伐战和攻坚战分开！这应该算有很大不同的两个模式，玩家喜好也很分明，应当加以区分而不是放在一起随机匹配。
6.个人觉得，准备界面（知道地图选兵种）做的不太合理，地图和兵种的适应性还不强，玩家之间的配合倒是很有必要。
选兵种的界面经常有人不点或者忘点确定，导致其余人等待的时间很长，比较浪费时间。
【经过最近一个更新后，该问题已恰当解决】
而且选兵种的界面太恶心，12个一模一样的头像到底有什么意义？？？既不能自定义，又不能显示装备。要是名字么还能加个好友，互相知道带的什么兵种。
最后结算时候的界面也一样，四个一模一样的超大头像，真是壮观→_→
【制作组诚意满满，最近每人发放了一张易容卡。该问题理论上已经给出了解决之道，但是几天下来，我发现重新捏脸的人还是很少，千人一面依旧很壮观！】
7.独立的兵营选项卡没什么用，补个兵还得切过去切过来，太麻烦！显示的兵种大图也算不上精美。首页太空了，人物模型的空间又太小，稍微长一点的武器就显示不全，还不如把人物模型的空间扩大，然后和之前的版本一样把兵营移到首页。
8.首页最下面一栏，在“开战”界面没有。但是上面的“任务”“好友”等选项又经常用到，建议设成每个界面都有那一栏。
最后，提这么多意见并不是鸡蛋壳挑骨头，而是真心喜欢这游戏，真心希望它越做越好！
非常感谢虎豹骑团队能带给我们这么精美好玩的游戏！！！

2017.2.24更新——《蓝贴2.23》阅后评论
支持了那么多次，唯一对这次官方的回应不满意。
一、不要光想着制作团队想加入游戏的东西，多想想玩家真正需求的东西。有些东西，玩家呼声那么大总是有原因的。
二、既然T5和T7的兵种实力一致，那我们花那么多精力和时间升级的意义何在？这既不符合游戏里兵种“升级”的设定，也不符合现实中的实际情况——曹公可不希望自己精心栽培的中原第一铁骑虎豹骑会被低好几级的普通枪兵轻松歼灭！
三、制作团队想看到同级战场中出现的兵种和战术变得更多样化，其实三国+罗马的各种各样的兵种已经做到了这一点。制作团队应该致力于开发更多的势力、兵种和兵种技能，而不是胡乱把各级兵塞进一个战场，再增加战场人数，做成大乱斗。

2017.3.12更新
要不怎么说是国产良心呢？！意见反馈没几天，制作组已经解决了大半，简直不要太贴心！
上文中【】内的内容是目前为止已做改进的方面。
既然如此，那就再反馈一个bug。偶然间遇到了一次，不知道怎么触发的。攻坚战，下坯之战，带骑兵，5级魏骑，使用冲锋技能时，冲锋方向的阵列出现，视角升高，然后技能就卡住了，不能释放也不能取消，主将可以移动，视角也能转动，但是不能攻击，不能使用其他技能和道具，然后直到我死亡复活后，该bug才消失。
 
没几天国服也要开了，真的希望，也确实在见证着虎豹骑在越做越好！

听说鬼服了，我很伤心，但是steam提名大奖要我来更新一下测评，我就来更新一下吧！ | Dynasty Warriors + Mount and Blade + Kessen. Very good game. The community isn't too toxic and there are peak times where matchmaking doesn't take too long. At early EST times it is difficult to find players but there is always AI and sometimes the AI is more useful than your teammates. It's a 5v5 team deathmatch with a guarded general on each side. There are 3 camps; a unit camp, a supply camp, and a health camp. You need to capture each camp which is a channel for about 8 seconds. Your units and 'guardian' will follow you and you may use troop/guardian skills + formations to kill your opponents. There is such a thing as strategic retreat and class troops and better vs others as you will see and the same goes for the weapons and armor you choose to wear. There is a lot of customization in the game and the devs are releasing even more content tomorrow (written 1 day before Rome comes out). You don't need to pay any money for the game just be aware to not spend copper without thinking it over. When you get to T5+ (level 5 troops) the experience needed to get to T6-T10 is a lot of hours put into the game. 
During matchmaking you will be matched with people that have your troop level so ignore the 'I got matched with op troops and didn't have a chance' comments because they probably used T3's and didn't hit the 'play with AI' button or something like that. 

I am an old school Koei fan before they screwed their games up and this game reminds me a lot of Dynasty Warriors 4 XL with Kessen features such as troop/guradian skills, with Mount and Blade combat. And it's free so you literally have nothing to lose!


EDIT: I did not purchase any DLC before I wrote this comment. However, after actually looking at the DLC and reading why people purchased the DLC, play the game a little and if you like it buy the Classic or Collection Pack. For the money these DLC's are way worth it but most of all it is important to give back to the devs, since this is a free game after all. You can buy things in game that will help you earn money/exp but these packs are a much better value. The Classic pack will set you up for a month of gameplay. I am going to buy some DLC so that the devs understand how many people enjoy their game. 

Devs listen to the community. This game is great if you like Dynasty Warriors, Mount and Blade, Kessen, Hack and Slash, Battlefield Tactics, Strategy, Chivalry, and like games! | 估计前面应该有人说过它的优缺点了，我就不说了，我唯一要提的是，这游戏的制作组才是真正的将此游戏视为一款游戏，而不是仅仅只用于赚钱的工具"

The gameplay is easy to understand and easy to master yet satisfying when you win. Not a huge time commitment for each round, but plenty of content to dive into if you so desire.

so what's the problem?

It's a port of a mobile game that has the bait/in game purchases removed but the adjustment that has been made to the reward system is insufficient. So in a game that's designed to have parts that can not be beaten until you attain better units, goading you into a purchase. You are stuck and forced to grind to obtain the ingame currency, which is very very limited unless you are able to win multiplayer matches, of which there are few because the game has so few players.


They have written in updates that the mobile versions have reduced drops, but i've played both and the grind is just as bad on the computer. Really rubs salt in the wound that you paid for a game on faith only to find out there's a free version. I'm not even going to ask for a refund i'm going to leave this review up to let people know to not waste their money.

I hope the devs see this and consider a rebalance of currency, or perhaps a larger assortment of units and cards upon purchase, more frequent drops of rewards. 
I would buy a dozen copies of this game for my friends, but I don't want them to be stuck after the first campaign like I am.  Whatever, it needs something to make the game progress feel like actual progress. | I paid for this game in Early Access and then it became free to play.

TL;DR:
- Très bien si vous aimez les wargames escarmouches
- Très bien si vous aimez réfléchir à l'optimisation
- Très bien si contrairement aux boulets vous lisez les règles
- Très bon rapport qualité prix
[Edit après plusieurs MAJ]
- Attention à ceux qui jouent LENTEMENT. Qui prennent une vie pour choisir un déplacement, une vie pour une carte. Oui, y en a pas mal alors prenez de quoi lire.
- Il y a des escarmouches où les dés sont contre vous. Vous avez beau prendre en tenaille, avoir plus de dés et jouer des cartes spéciales, l'ennemi remporte les assauts. Oui, c'est très improbable mais pas impossible. Et bien des fois votre réacteur à improbabilité s'emballe et vous passez une partie à subir misérablement une stratégie adverse nulle, mais bénie par Benten de bout en bout.


J'adore les wargames. J'ai joué plein de batailles dans mon salon ou dans mon garage, parfois des week end entiers. C'est un ami qui m'a parlé de ce jeu, et j'ai voulu essayer. 6€ ça me semblait pas très cher. Et ça les vaut largement.

J'ai lu des avis de rageux qui ne comprennent pas les dés, ni les cartes, ni la raison de la perte de dés. C'est sûr que s'ils n'ont pas lu les règles (RTFM!!! ou LCPDM en français) ils ne vont rien comprendre du tout et passer à côté du jeu. Donc n'écoutez pas ces avis idiots.

J'ai aimé ce jeu car il est assez exigeant dans la tactique et la stratégie. 
- Tactique car il faut bien choisir ses placements (si je mets mon personnage là, son samouraï devra soit le charger, soit le contourner, ce qui me laissera le temps de redéployer mon archer derrière cette palissade, par exemple.), bien choisir le moment de jouer une carte (si j'attends ce lancé de dé, je pourrais accumuler assez d'honneur pour combiner ces deux cartes, par exemple), bien choisir sa cible (si je focus ce plus faible, je pourrai prendre en tenaille le plus fort et lui faire perdre des dés et du déplacement) etc.
- Stratégique car il faut bien choisir son équipe. J'ai croisé des équipes que de tireurs, ou que de trois gros lourds; bref des équipes dont les personnages s'articulaient mal entre eux, qui ne faisaient pas synergie. De même il n'y a pas de cartes miracles. Dans mon deck j'ai peu de grosses cartes, mais j'ai des combinaisons de petites cartes et ça passe très bien. 

Enfin j'ai aimé car je n'ai rien dépensé une fois le jeu acheté. J'ai fini la campagne, j'ai plus de personnages ""doré"" que j'ai de place dans mes équipes, j'ai toutes les cartes en double exemplaire. Je ""détruits"" mes cartes en trop et mes figurines pas assez rares pour récupérer des poussières et fabriquer ce dont j'ai envie ou besoin. 

Y a que du multi et pas assez de solo, c'est vrai. Mais le temps de trouver une partie j'ai le temps de lire un webcomic. Les parties ne sont pas très rapide. J'ai pas chronométré mais ça doit faire dans les 5 à 10minutes. Mais si on aime les batailles c'est très bien. | I think this game is great except for a couple of things that I feel might make other players not even bother. 

1. Your units don't gain honor (xp) in the single player campaign. I don't really mind playing the multiplayer except that the Arena (which is a second multiplayer mode) doesn't seem to have anyone playing it and after playing 150 hard-earned coins for access I just sit waiting for a player. This also means that the arena quests are mostly worthless as there doesn't seem to be anyone playing. Again, all this would be a non-issue if I could just level up my units in the single player campaigns which are fun (if short) 

2. I don't mind grinding the single player campaigns to get coins through quests/achievements but you only get three quests at a time. One is a regular multiplayer quest (like kill 10 enemies in multiplayer), the second is an arena quest that after the initial one, you will never complete. The third is a single-player quest but there's a catch. The quests require you to complete the same campaign in all the difficulty levels before you get quests for the other two campaigns. When you get the ""Complete Cutthroats Campaign at Insane difficulty"" you will need to have leveled up your units to max level to even have a chance of completing that quest. Since Arena is dead and the single player requires leveled units to complete the quest, you're stuck grinding the regular multiplayer for hours and hours. This gets especially tedious once you've completed 50% or so of the acheivements (which also give coins) 

Since the arena multiplayer community is pretty much dead, this ends up being a great game that you can't really get all the best from. If the devs would enable leveling in single-player and perhaps add more quests then this game would be on my all-time top 10 pc games. Even then, the single player is so fun that I'd easily put it in the top 20. | THIS GAME HAS NO MEANINGFUL PVE - just need to get that out the way, to avoid any disappointment.
The core of the game is collecting & levelling troops, and PvE doesn't contribute to either (negligible loot & no XP) - in fact, aside from the tutorial, you really shouldn't even attempt PvE until you have PvP'd yourself some stronger troops.

** Pros **
Really interesting videogame concept, well executed with a very nice price point.
The game is heavily random (as dice based), but there's nonetheless plenty to do strategically.
The PvP seems to be very pick-up-and-play; you don't have to socialize and there's no chat.

** Cons **
Seeing as how quick PvP skirmishes form the bulk of gameplay, it gets pretty repetitive for a game that needs to be played a lot to make progress.
While well presented, afraid I just found the setting & units very bland and hard to distinguish; there's no fantastical units (e.g. sorcerers or oni), no ninjas, or even simply unique characters - nor is there any world-building of note.

In conclusion: excellent value 'hobby game' if you are in the market & don't want the temptation of microtransactions, but don't expect memorable PvE or story-telling - really hope that the developers plan expansions, or to use this engine/model for miniature games in livelier settings."

The influence is undeniable, and I could feel its spirit seeping through the gameplay. The campaign offers a solid, well-structured experience, while the multiplayer delivers the standard fare you’d expect from an RTS. That, in essence, is the theme of this game—it doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it delivers a polished and well-executed version of familiar mechanics.

My biggest gripe is the unit design. Many units look too similar, which can make it difficult to differentiate them at a glance. Additionally, the two main factions, while distinct in playstyle, share a somewhat uniform aesthetic, which makes them feel less visually unique than they could be.

On the positive side, the game excels in its command and control mechanics. The speed at which you can build, group, and maneuver your forces is impressive. The V key will quickly become your best friend, as it allows you to form cohesive armies that support one another effectively. However, the attack-move function can be a bit frustrating—frontline units will engage while those in the rear sometimes idle instead of pushing forward. The best workaround is to avoid attack-move and instead overshoot your target, ensuring your forces spread out and engage as intended.

If you find Ashes of the Singularity on sale and have a soft spot for Supreme Commander, it’s absolutely worth picking up. I’ve had a great time with it, and despite some minor flaws, it delivers an enjoyable large-scale RTS experience. | I wish more games would take this approach its simple but not halo wars simple(love that game too btw). | Once you get the hang of it, it is fun.

- Basenbau, Ressourcenabbau, Verteidigungsanlagen, alles sehr simpel und langweilig

打着梦想的旗号圈钱，那么这游戏我真的喜欢不上了 | Ich habe 2 Wochen lang die Open Beta GESUCHTET. Ein Freund hat mir das Spiel gezeigt, und ich war sofort angefixt. Dieses Spiel bringt das gute alte Castle-Fight Prinzip aus Warcraft 3 zurück, und das in wunderschöner Grafik, auf verschiedenen Maps, mit Verschiedenen Rassen (3 in der Open Beta, aber ich hoffe dass es mehr werden) welche zahlreiche Rassen-Fähigkeiten besitzen die man vor jeder Runde nach belieben aussuchen kann. Dazu noch ein Runen System, ähnlich wie ein Skill System, wo man Runen freischalten/kaufen kann, und in einem Build einsetzen kann, um zum beispiel die eigenen Einheiten stärker und schneller zu machen, oder mehr Gold oder Essenz pro Minute zu erhalten, und und und. Ausserdem besitzt jede Rasse eine Vielzahl an Kreaturen, welche, wenn man genug Coins erarbeitet hat, sogar ""Upgraden"" kann. Zumindest gibt es von verschiedenen Einheiten mehrere Versionen. Zum Beispiel der Flammenwerfer Soldat der Terraner hat noch andere Alternativen, darunter z.b. den ""DragonBreath"" wenn ich mich recht entsinne, welcher auf Knopfdruck eine größere reichweite und ein größeres AOE hat und in einem hohen Bogen schiesst statt in einer linie. zudem hat er von anfang an mehr rüstung und leben glaub ich.  Zudem kann man die Einheiten wärend einem laufenden Spiel nochmal zusätzlich upgraden, indem man Forschungspunkte in die jeweilige Einheit packt, wodurch Sie mehr Leben, Angriff, oder Schild erhält usw.
Ah, was ich noch vergessen habe zu erwähnen: die Verschiedenen Rassen haben auch verschieden SPEZIAL Fähigkeiten, wie zb. Die Terraner mit ""Massenproduktion"" sie können sich ausserhalb einer runde 3 verschiedene Einheiten aussuchen auf die sie dann ""Mengenrabatt"" kriegen. wenn sie dann zb. 10 Sniper anstelle von nur 1 Bauen, kostet sie das 20% weniger ressourcen. Eine andere Rasse bekommt 90% der ursprünglichen ressourcen zurück, wenn sie eine Einheit verkauft, wieder eine andere Rasse kann eine Einheit gegen eine völlig andere tauschen, zb. nahkämpfer gegen Fernkämpfer und umgekehrt, für einen geringen aufpreis.
Zudem gibt es noch Daily Quests zu erledigen, alle 8 Stunden Truhen zu öffnen, und eine UNZAHL von Erfolgen die man freischalten kann, welche einem noch mehr Belohnungen geben.

Also ich für meinen Teil freue mich wahnsinnig auf dieses Spiel und sitze hier wie auf glühenden Kohlen, gespannt wann ich endlich wieder meine Armeen in den Kampf schicken darf. ;D | 说实话，从来没写过STM评价，把第一次送给这款国产游戏，这个游戏刚出的时候我就买了，作为一名主机游戏的主播，我每天都要尝试不同的游戏。这款游戏很吸引我，很多观众说看了我玩了这个游戏，果断下载，每天跟一群水友玩的不亦乐乎，竞技匹配系统要做的更完善就好了。游戏是个不错的游戏，期待正式版！最重要的一点是，咱这个制作团队很热情，很有心，像这样的团队做出来的游戏也一定不会差的！支持！ | 예전에 노바 1492인지 1942인지 암튼 그 추억의 게임과 비슷한 형식입니다
대신 유닛 생산만 가능하고 컨트롤은 일체 못하구요
생산하면 알아서 걸어가서 때립니다
예전 플래쉬 게임 중에 이런게 있던거 같은데..

그렇다고 생산하고 손만 놓고 있는건 아니고
중간중간 스킬로 전세 역전도 가능합니다
기껏 시즈엔진 뽑았는데 상대방 빔 한방에 사라지면 슬퍼요

그리고 한 번 자원으로 생산하면 그 후로는 자원 소모 없이 같은 양이 계속 나오네요
추가로 생산할 때만 자원을 씁니다
그래서 40라운드 쯤 가면 유닛들이 쌓이고 쌓여서 수백기가 뒤엉켜 싸우는 장관이 펼쳐지기도 합니다

라운드가 진행되면서 자원 캐는 양 업그레이드도 가능한데
대신 업그레이드하는 동안은 자원이 늘어나지 않습니다
상대방이 자원 업그레이드 중일 때 빠르게 몰아치는 것도 가능할듯

상대방이 투명 유닛을 뽑으면 거기에 맞게 감지 유닛 뽑아줘야 되고..
무턱대고 지상 유닛만 뽑다가 공중 유닛 한기에게 털리기도 하고 그럽니다

덱 짜듯이 유닛을 구성하고
상대방 유닛들에 바로바로 전략 수정으로 대응하면서 상대방 기지를 털어버리면 이깁니다


장점
1. 컨트롤이 크게 필요없는 게임이다보니 저 같은 피지컬 딸리는 유저들도 편하게 할 수 있네요
2. 진행은 단순하지만 눈치 싸움이 나름 치열합니다
3. 같은 종족인데도 서로 다른 유닛, 다른 패턴으로 싸우고 있는거 보면 밸런스도 나쁘지 않은듯
4. 1판당 길어야 15분 짧으면 10분 안으로 끝납니다
5. 새로운 유닛은 게임 내 재화로도 살 수 있습니다

단점
1. 게임 내 재화 얻기가 아주 미칩니다. 베타 중이면 돈 좀 뿌려주지
2. 룬 시스템이 거지 같습니다. 큰 차이는 없지만 어쨌든 지갑전사와는 차이가 날 수 밖에 없음
3. 맵이 다 똑같습니다. 배경은 다른데 어차피 일직선인데 어쩔. 덕분에 매판 매판이 비슷한 느낌입니다
4. 그리 심하진 않지만 어쨌든 영어


가볍게 즐기기에 좋은 전략 게임
이런 종류의 게임을 어려워하는 초보들이 쉽게 접해 볼 수 있을듯 | Игра интересная, но не для всех.
Смысл игры такой: вы заказываете определенное количество юнитов, и каждые несколько секунд они респяться и сами (без вашего участия) бегут на врага. Тут выигрывает не тактика, не скорость нажатия кнопок, а точный расчет: выбор самых лучших солдат по соотношению цена/качество. Что лучше, купить 10 простых пехотинцев за 100 монет или 1 танк за 1000? И из этого складываетсья вся игра.

Минусы (для беты не критично):
1) Отсутсвие русского интерфейса.
2) отсутствие локализации.
3) В цеом, быстро надоедает, в виду малого разнообразия.

Plenty of cooperative stealth but rarely does a game put you against other players. In fact, the best comparison is the “Spies vs Mercs” mode on Splinter Cell: Blacklist. Basically, if you liked that mode but found it to be too severe on the Call of Duty spectrum of gaming, then I have news for you!

OGAT is the same idea but in a more indie/flash game type style. Makes sense, as many people who play it through Kongregate and aren’t even aware it’s on Steam.

The core mechanics are simple; The Guards tend to be better equipped with more health and assault weapons. The thieves have crossbows and silenced weapons, less health, but one major advantage; Night vision. They must navigate all the maps and turn off the lights while they steal a specific item that only they know about. The guards can find and patrol the multiple items but are not aware of which one it is, giving the less-equipped thieves a tactical advantage. Distraction is a major gameplay element here.

There are also other modes to mix this up, including a Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Bomb Defusal, and more.

If I had to find a criticism, well... There’s two. They both overlap slightly.

The first is that the playerbase is incredibly small, usually peaking at 200 people and going down to 40-60 in off hours. While this is a fine core for the main game mode, I have found it very difficult to explore other game modes such as CTF, or that extra large map where you explore and loot (and what ever happened to Slender?!) I pretty much see 0/10 on all servers unless it’s private or just on a different gametype.

Due to the small base of players, there’s no matchmaking and games don’t always autoshuffle so sometimes it can feel like a team is outclassing another. If it does shuffle, there may be a couple of particularly experienced players crushing everyone who just downloaded and are giving it a try. I'm not the worst player but I have on a few occasions found myself in an endless loop of failure because one enemy was just crushing it. I have some friends who can barely play it for more than twenty minutes at a time and it’s a shame.

The flip side of this; There's no equipment or pay2win system here. If you play enough you can eventually learn the maps, figure out decent hiding patterns, and perform better yourself. 
(Protip: Guards can turn off their flashlights and hide in bushes themselves, which is hard to see even with night vision). That kind of thing.

Regardless, It’s a great, small game with a fair amount of replayability. The matches are quick and bite-sized, and you can usually get several games in just twenty minutes or so. | This Game is awesome it have so many different gamemodes (Guards and Thieves,Team Death Match,Zombie Rush,Faceless(Slenderman),Insta Gib,Soccer,VIP,CTF,...), i love the design and the originall Game idea in the gamemode ""Guard and Thieves"" where the Guards defend some objects and the thieves try to steal one of them. But in the moment you feel that this game is in Early Access because you can't change Weapons so you have to play with the basic Equipment which the class offers. But i am looking forward that the developer add more Items and the New Singleplayer mode.

BUY IT!!
THE COMMUNITY MUST GROW!! | Если кто-то еще не знает об этой игре, то это что-то типо контер-страйка; только вид сверху и геймплей делает упор больше на тактику.

Классический режим с воровством ценностей здесь немного напоминает ""закладку бомбы"". Есть ряд точек на карте которые можно своровать. Истинную цель (она всегда одна) видят только воры. Важно взять хабар и успеть донести до зоны эвакуации. Если охрана поймет какие у воров намерения, то игра за красных считай слита. Менты постоянно начнут дежурить возле этого сокровища. Поэтому важно отвлекать врагов воровством других ценностей, чтобы они не понимали, что хотят украсть соперники.

Здесь вообще много интересных режимов игры. Есть прямо свистнутые у контер-страйк, типа, Защити Випа, или TDM. 
А есть и уникальные вроде ""Зомби"" (школьники его ооочень любят).

Есть классы. В основном различаются быстрый-хилый, толстый-медленный. Хотя, в наличии доктор (медсестра.. вроде). 
Покупать оружие вот нельзя, довольствуйтесь тем, что дается с персонажем. 
Но главное отличие между командами, это то, что воры обладают ночным зрением, а охрана вынуждена использовать фонарик. Также воры могут ползать в воздушных люках, или пролазить в некоторых местах (окна например). Ментам так делать видимо честь мундира не позволяет.

Воры априори слабее. Хуже вооружены, здоровья меньше. Но зато их союзник - тьма. Два вора в глухом лесу шутя вырежут всю команду соперника. Банально потому что они вас видят, а вы их нет. Стрелять в центр светлого круга от фонарика одно удовольствие. Лампочки в зданиях можно и нужно гасить\зажигать в зависимости от того за какую команду играем. 

Вроде по основным аспектам - все. Там на самом деле гораздо больше всякого интересного, и благо есть возможность ознакомиться с игрой не покупая ее - советую так и сделать.
Есть редактор карт, но пока нельзя поделиться своими творениями. Обещают добавить. Жду... очень...
10 воплей ""читер"" из 10, если лучше играешь. | 首先你需要注意，大陆玩家玩本游戏必须翻墙，否则可能无法连接到服务器。

游戏模式基本类似于《细胞分裂》的多人游戏模式。视野、光线、走位对游戏的影响很大。除去翻墙的因素，游戏本身的质量是很不错的。 | В игре есть две команды - охранники и воры. В оригинальном режиме, задача воров - украсть какой либо объект, а у охранников - выяснить, что это за объект и защитить его. Чтобы похитить объект, воры могут лазить через разбитые окна и вентеляции, что охранники делать не могут, а также все могут прятаться в кустах.(Охранники могут это использовать, чтобы неожиданно атаковать вора. В игре очень многое зависит от света. Воры имеют прибор ночного видения, а охранники только фонарик, что делает их более слабыми в темноте и заставляет воров вырубать свет везде где могут.
О классах: 
В игре есть несколько классов и в каждой тиме они различаются. 
В обеих тимах можно пикнуть медика и лечить своих тиммейтов.
Можно пикнуть ""танка"", у охранников он имеет щит, который поглощает весь урон спереди, но отнимает возможность стрелять, а у воров он просто имеет кучу хп и автомат...
Можно пикнуть ""роумера""(roamer), у охранников он имеет высокую скорость и фаер, который СВЕЕТИТСЯ, а у воров он имеет нож, убивающий почти всех с одной тычки.
Есть ""бойцы"", у охранников он базируется на сражении на средних дистанциях и гранатах, а у воров, он сражается на дальних дистанциях, наносит достаточно высокий урон и требует обладать хорошей меткостью.
Есть классы базирующиеся на контроле, они ни чем особо не отличаются, кроме оружия(Снаряжение работает по одной схеме), могут хорошо контроллировать территорию, также охранник имеет хил-спрей.
В новом апдейте появился пиро - за охранников, который имеет высокий дпс за счёт огнемёта и тоже хорошо контроллирует территорию за счёт напалм-гранат.
""Терминатор""- юзаете дробовик в упор и добиваете с пистолета, вот и вся тактика...
Плюсы: 
+Увлекательный геймплей
+Нет читеров(Я по крайней мере не видел)
+Классов хоть и мало, но геймплей за них разительно отличается
+Много режимов для фана
+Есть редактор карт
+Можно эксперементировать с тактиками
+Можно фанится с друзьями
Минусы:
-Мало игроков
-Редко выходят апдейты
-Достаточно большой пинг на большинстве сервов(Для игроков из рашки)
Если честно, я удивлён, что у игры такой маленький онлайн.
Оценка: 8/10

Isso é bizarro, pois a gente(brasileiros) dominamos o jogo, o que a gente pede a vocês da Joycity é apenas o lançamento de um servidor na América do Sul sem lag para nós, pois é muito complicado você jogar um jogo de futebol com um delay, onde vc quer fazer uma interceptação de passe ou um desarme de bola, porém você tem que adivinhar ou ficar clicando q nem louco, pq existe o delay infelizmente.

#SOUTHAMERICASERVER
#BRAZILIANSERVER

TRADUÇÃO: The game is very good, I loved playing in 2015 when it was inherited by Z8Games, but it left me wanting some things when I went to see, took some skills, but added others, the interface was more beautiful, but you from Joycity have to see that only I have a Brazilian on the servers, I DO NOT HAVE A DEPARTURE with someone near US Central.
This is bizarre, because we (Brazilians) dominate the game, what we ask you from Joycity is only the launch of a server in South America without lag for us, because it is very difficult for you to play a soccer game with A delay, where you want to do a pass intercept or a ball disarm, however you have to guess or get clicked or crazy, because the delay exists unfortunately. | Yesterday I would have said that this is a great game, it has great direction and potential, but now I see that the developers are pretty much the same masterminds behind their previous Freestyle game.  And when I say masterminds I mean they charge 30 dollars for a character - which has significant stat advantages and is unobtainable without paying.

Pros:
+Character Customization
+Decent Community
+Skill Intensive
+Can't Gain Significant Edge Through Paying

Cons:
-50%+ of Content Microtransactions
-F2P Content Is Lame(for the most part your character won't look unique unless you drop 40$+ on the game)
-Goalies are AI and inconsistent at that.  Literally have watched a 3 point lead blown because the goalie stared at the ball.
-80% of the community doesn't pass the ball
-90% of Defenders don't know how to tackle
-Everyone Plays Striker, No one is good at it
-Developers Change Event Rewards at will
-Overwhelming number of South American players.  No South American Server(which is in high demand and sure to come).
-Game existed 2 years ago and eventually went under.

A little extra on that last Con, and which was ultimately the last straw for me and this game.  Yesterday you were able to obtain E-Coins which are temporary versions of the irl currency alot of the microtransactions of the game go on.  Yesterday there was also several oppurtunities to unlock the 30$ characters - which was exclusive through a temporary two month long event.  However without any news, warning, or statement whatsoever the game decided to change the first 5 game of the day reward from 150 e-coins to a 1000 points(which to put into perspective is about two games, or 12 minutes) - Basically locking over 50% of the content in the game from the free to play community.  Overall I think the level 48 reward that existed(and was also changed) which gave the player 3000 e-coins(30$) was overwhelming, and they have pushed it to a level 56 reward to unlock 1000 e-coins, which is essentially a single premium stat item.  

Ultimately it is a free to play game and developers have the right to charge whatever they want for whatever they deem should become a microtransaction and I respect that.  Overall the game doesn't punish the f2p players, seeing as every stat-based item has a free equivilent, however there is little incentive in the game to work towards.  If you don't want to drop 20 dollars in the game the max you will be able to do is kick a curve ball and have an afro - maybe eventually having a shirt if you decide to drop 30+ hours into the game to get a level 56 character.  However even then small portion of content will be unavailable because e-coins dissappear after seven days meaning to unlock a free character you'd need to get 3 characters to level 56 within a 7 day period.(like storing 3 of them at level 55 and getting that last level for all of them at once) - but seeing as they have already done random changes to the game to prevent players from getting free characters, it wouldn't surprise me if they decide to change the game again upon reading my review.   Ultimately if you're looking for a game to play with a few friends and kill a few minutes out of your day, this is your stop.  If you are looking for a game to actually pour some time into I'd recommend spending money on a different game up front.  

I'd give the game a 6/10.  If they add a SA server and make goalies slightly customizable so as to be more consistent, less luck based, and not completely retarded at times - the game would be an 8/10.  If they hadn't of screwed over the event-rewards and proved themselves to have a disconnect with the community, the game would be an 8/10.  If both of those existed, the game would be 10/10 perfect - seeing as all content would be unlockable, the playerbase would be consistent with its locaton(meaning less lag in matches), and goalies would be consistent so as not to tip games in the favor of whichever sides goalie isn't retarded(because nothinig says victory like your goalie catching uncatchable balls but the enemies goalie literally ducking to avoid the ball).

Final Score: 6/10
Developer Score: 3/10
Would I play this game: With Friends
Would I pay in this game: No
Esport Capability: Not Likely

Audio: 8/10(Audio Queues are Useful)
Gameplay: 5/10(Goalie AI sucks, Lag)
Graphics: 7/10(Cartoony Art Style)
Music: 8/10(Tight Soundtrack - Probably best part about the game is the rap soundtrack)
Replay Value: 4/10(No Incentive for F2P players; Pay to look cool, not play to look cool.)

Che dirvi, spero che la voce si diffondi ancor di più, e vi auguro un buon game a tutti! | Gdy zobaczyłem grafike, przyznam że podchodziłem dosyć sceptycznie, ale sprobowalem i nie żałuję!
Ok, od początku...

Matchmaking działa dosyć sprawnie (tylko nikt nie chce grać obrońcami...). 
Mecze są bardzo przyjemne, szybkie i wymagające jeżeli gra się ze znajomymi (lub ma się szczęście w losowaniu zawodników do druzyny) naprawdę można się wciągnąć.

They even host their own tournaments quite often! The gameplay is simple on the surface, but with all the possible combinations of spells make it such a fun and learning experience! Oh, and curving spells? i can't curve my head around it but it sure is nifty once you know it!
My only complaint, would be the struggle of levelling up and getting gems. I think there would be a much greater incentive to play more often if gems did not feel like such a slog to earn, and the items so expensive. If new players could feel like they have some more options, im sure it would be much more enticing to all!!! | Magnifica piccola perla, per chi vuole una sfida originale :)
mi è piaciuto molto la meccanica di potenziamento in base al piu debole in kill che va a bilanciare molto i match durante il gioco.
Assolutamente consigliato :) | Absolutely abysmal controls. I started on kbm. First it has me in mouse movement mode which was insane that they even conceived a version of controls like that. I hit F1 to swap to WASD. I play a bit like that. The mouse doesn't have a cursor, it only reads your recent direction of mouse movement to move an arrow. Holy crap that's awful. They suggest you do controller, okay fair enough. I pull on the controller and low and behold it still feels awful. It's not like a twin stick shooter the direction you cast is just the last direction you were inputting on left stick. You can start casting a spell and your arrow disappears then it just fires out at a direction no where near where you were aiming.

Requested refund. 10 minutes in and I can tell this ain't it. | It's a quirky game best enjoyed with friends. Not to be taken too seriously, just have fun with it! | Being a wizard is cool. Being a better wizard than your friends is cooler. Solid 8.5/10. Would recommend"

76561197999259031,577490,Minos Strategos,2.316666666666667,Strategy,6,"This is another fantastic game by BrainGoodGames.  I'm a big fan of their other games, and this one could be their absolute best.  It takes ideas from all their previous games, improves pretty much everything, and makes a nearly perfect game, in my opinion.  

The game is kind of difficult to explain, but very easy to learn with the excellent in-game tutorial.  Plus, there is a link in-game to a video tutorial which also helps greatly.  The game is played on a grid, similar to Chess or Othello.  It's basically a race to collect enough points before the AI collects their points.  You collect points by moving your pieces into 'temple' squares.  Every turn you get points for how many temples you own.  Same for the AI, who is moving minotaurs to try to take these same temples.  

The brilliant part of the game is the card playing.  You get three cards from your deck each turn, and can play one of them.  You can also move one unit one space, or add a new unit to the board.  The cards are basically different kinds of attacks and unit spawning, based on the patterns you have your units set in.  It is a very unique and wonderfully fun game mechanic.  You can pull off some very cool moves by setting up your forces in the proper pattern, then unleash one of your cards for mega damage or tactical paradrops of units onto key spaces.

It's a wonderfully addictive game, with leaderboards, different play modes, e.g. card drafting, no timer mode.  Also, a new double secret probation mode is being designed, which should be out soon.  

The developer is super responsive.  Often new builds will appear within hours of finding a bug, or a new feature that the developer likes will be implemented super quick.

All boardgame and tactical gamer fans should own this one.  It's a work of art. | Only at 2 hours and I already want to praise this game.
I can only compare to Axes and Acres, another great game from this developer, and this game is a big improvement. Axes and Acres (you should really try it, it 's great) had one problem: the drawn conditions could be so hard several times in a row that you got disappointed and your level went down a lot. EDIT: This issue has been fixed since patch 1.05.

This game, however, doesn't have this issue. It's truly strategy and the conditions are merely decided by random locations where enemies spawn and the order in which you draw your cards from your stack. This is as close a to a real skill-test you can get.

At first, I thought it was a big mistake to add a timer in this game (which you can disable), but I have found that I always get enough time to think through my strategy.

As usual, the tutorial is very short (too short) and you need to try and think for yourself. I don't mind, but children of this century usually want more. You can watch some youtube movies if you need more info, but you really CAN figure it out yourself, it's not that hard and certainly not as hard to grasp as Axes and Acres.
Also, as usual, the graphics are very simple (maybe a bit ugly), but you shouldn't care about that because it's a brain game. Even if it was purely ascii, it would still be great.

I bought this game initially only to support the developer (in case you haven't noticed, he is a great guy, responsive to everyone, bugfixing the same day, ...) because I liked the initial thoughts I had before playing it, but I was actually expecting to not be getting into it. I was wrong. This game pulled me right in and it's great!

EDIT: still though, I got a bit bored of it after 8 hours and returned to Axes and Acres which since patch 1.05 still is the best IMO. | A simple strategy game with easy to learn rules and a surprising amount of depth. Every decision feels important. 

[b]The Objective[/b]
The objective is simple. Gather enough victory points to win by moving your stones on to temple squares. Every turn your stones are on a temple they collect points. The challenge is defending against the minotaurs. The minotaurs can gain points from standing on temples too. If they gain enough points they win. Each turn you can move or place a stone and play a card. Cards are what mix up the gameplay. Some cards give you abilities like +3 Moves or Spawn 2, but most cards let you do special attacks if your stones are in certain formations on the board. You receive a new card after every 3 games you play to keep things fresh.

[b]The Twists[/b]
As you rank up there are new twists added in. There are new enemies like the plague minotaur, the serpent, the golem, and the hydra that all have unique traits. Then there are artifacts which is my favorite twist. They are symbols that appear on the board that when collected grant you abilities that you can use at any point in the game. 

[b]Conclusion[/b]
This is a very great underappreciated strategy game. It really makes you think what is the best possible decision and consider the trade-offs of each choice. | Now that I've played quite a few games of Minos Strategos and moved up a few ranks I feel confident in saying this game is another great addition to the BrainGoodGames collection of strategy games.

The tutorial is a bit brief and left me with some questions. Watching a short video that is linked to on the main page of the game soon cleared up the questions I had. There is a practise mode so if you aren't sure how something works and you want to experiment, you can do so without affecting your rank.

Games are quick, 5 to 10 minutes. One of the many great features is that the game introduces now features as you advance in levels - new cards, new Minotaurs to fight, special collectible bonuses, so it won't get old in a hurry. I put over 50 hours into BrainGoodGames' Axes and Acres, their games are dangerously addictive. | A well-crafted classic game 
with a nice soundtrack that evokes the ancient Greece setting.

Chess-like, taking turns
but it's ""control the temples"" to score points and win,
not ""control the center of the board"" and capture opponent's pieces to win.
So that's refreshingly un-bloodthirsty.

Cards give it randomness and replayability,
but this is not a deckbuilder.

Good ""work-for-brain"" puzzle board to solve when you have 5 or 10 minutes to play."

Con:Too easy for me to dominate the kids | Brain/Out is a 2D screen scrolling shooter where you can play a small selection of game modes with and against other players. If you remember the days of 'Pawn', you'll recognise a very similar game here. Featured within the game is a decent arsenal of weapons, from the AS VAL and AK12 to the M1911 and SPAS-12, as well as various options for equipment including C4 and a Barricade Tool/Builder, and a choice of perks, from running faster to carrying a little more ammo.

Today being the game's debut, it somewhat lacks in variety of maps and gamemodes, although this is understandable. You have your standard Deathmatch (Free For All), Team Deathmatch, and a mode similar to CoD's Domination, or Battlefield's Conquest where you must hold three points and beat the other team for points. The maps are interesting, with some breakable windows and plenty of ladders, but nothing too extravagant. What stands out however is that the game is a lot harder than it looks on the surface. You won't be able to see any enemies until they are in your line of sight, or if you have just recently seen them. So be careful descending that ladder, or you could suddenly bump into a couple of angry foes. As well as this, guns are very lethal, and you'll only be able to survive a couple of hits at most. This keeps things interesting and challenging, as you could be returning fire on the shooter across the screen, to run for cover, then you'll be ambushed by another enemy and killed very quickly. It's a game which punishes you for not thinking before you act.

The weapons are nicely varied and you have a selection of firearms to choose from, but from the start you'll have unlocked the Makarov Pistol, TOZ-34 Shotgun, AKS-74U Carbine, and the MP5 SMG. They allow for a bit of experimentation at the start which is great, since you don't want to be stuck at the start of a multiplayer experience with maybe two useless weapons. All the weapons I've used so far have played very well and realistically, with the sole exception of the TOZ-34. This shotgun is not treated like any of the other shotguns which fire pellets. This one fires slugs, and so it fires one accurate projectile at a time. It's horrendously accurate at that, so it's an early game AWP essentially. I cannot say if this is due to unbalance or keeping in the hardcore nature of the game. Otherwise the gunplay is good and really what makes the game.

You also have your equipment selection which lets you bring in gear like a Flashbang, or two Grenades, or maybe even an Ammo Box or Medkit. You also have a kind of building tool, which lets you place sandbags. They are affected by gravity and won't stand still in midair, but they can be stuck to walls to be used as a ladder. You can also create an improvised bunker from them. It's an interesting feature I've seen in a few games, but it has high potential for exploitation. You also have a slot for perks, which are rather run-of-the-mill in any shooter - run faster, shoot better, more ammo, tougher, etc. Nothing unusual but it allows for a bit more options in combat.

The weapons themselves can be upgraded with several attachments, but they are preset and unique for that weapon, so there's not a huge range for customisation. Along with this you can upgrade the base stats of the weapon, so you can shoot more accurately, reload faster, and such. You can unlock more for your weapon by using it more, and some weapons can only be unlocked by using others, ie. 120 M4A1 kills gets you the SCAR. It's a good way of encouraging the player to try other weapons out instead of sticking to the same one forever. Weapon skins are also available, but must be unlocked through a crate drop.

Now this is the part that might turn some people off - but the game will drop a few crates at the end of the match. They can be opened for free and can contain things like bonus XP and Scrap for repairing and upgrading weapons you use a lot, but you can also get Golden Crates for real money. THANKFULLY, they only tend to drop stuff in the Standard crate, with a high chance for better items such as player and weapon skins. It's not a game breaker by any means, but if you enjoy the game enough and want to try and get a fancy new character skin (STALKER's Cheeki Breeki tracksuit Bandit and Jacket from Hotline Miami are two of the several skins), then I would suggest it's worth the $0.99 (£0.79).

Lastly you have a trophy system where you can pick up enemy weapons and it will add them to your trophy collection - this is cool since it's also very similar to the Battlefield Tag collecting idea, and you can scrap trophies you don't want to keep in your collection for more scrap, useful for weapon upgrades and repairs. Trophies will also include the name of the player they belong to so it works as a bragging rights table if you have a lot of trophies.

Other than this I think I have covered most of what I have experienced in my first day of playing this game. I would recommend it to people who enjoy side-scrolling shooters and are looking for a challenging F2P multiplayer game. Currently free of P2W and hopefully it stays like that, as it is definitely a fun game to kill some time."

Would prefer somewhat of a narrative at all, might have livened things up a bit. Also do not care at all for the philosophy. Just kinda lame and corny...

     End of the day what bothers me the most is the loop of constantly going to outer space, clicking on dogshit meteor and ending up back looking at earth again.

So far, it has been a relatively enjoyable experience. The combat is fairly fun, though nothing special. They advertise it as a highspeed action non-targeted fun time party, and it's not really all that exciting. You can do some flips to avoid attacks, but when facing PvE monsters it seems to be better to just sidestep a punch manually. The flips (and sprinting and jumping, yes, jumping) take energy from the same resource pool that is used to cast abilities. Side note: in my first PvP match, I accidentally side-flipped off the map. Acrobatics can be dangerous, kids. 

I joined a capture the flag match and it was actually pretty fun! The map design was unfathomably tedious, but the skirmishes that took place were pretty sweet. Both teams sort of clashed at the middle, and the one melee class had a hard time joining the fight without exploding, but with proper timing and tactics, it was possible. Once we started working as a team, we could stand our ground pretty effectively. You can queue for these matches as soon as you leave the tutorial.

Regarding the PvE experience, the first 10-15 quests are essentially: 

""Go talk to John."" 

""Hi John.

""Go talk to Sean.""

""Hi Sean.""

""I can't talk right now. Pretty busy. See if John needs anything.""

I haven't played for very long yet, and I've already been tasked with killing some stuff, so hopefully the quests will become a bit more interesting/dynamic. 

It's not a very pretty game, and the menu navigation could use some improvement. But as an Early Access title, you gotta be patient and try to help facilitate proper patching. 

Like I said, my opinion is sort of good and sort of bad. I genuinely think the game will improve over time, and I'm excited to see how it changes for the better. If you are looking for a polished game, then stop browsing Early Access titles and play Neopets (actually, the Neopets in-game economy exploded a while back. It's fallen into chaos.). 

Anyway, I don't really know who this game is for. I don't think I would recommend it to someone who just likes MMORPG's, because so far the questing and PvE stuff is really bland. But the PvP is neat, and could end up being a strong reason to play the game. It wasn't a negative experience, which is why this review isn't a thumbs-down. Maybe you should wait a bit to try it out, or maybe you'd like to be part of the community that's already giving feedback. It's up to you. I'm going to keep playing it for now and see what happens. 

This review is horrendously ambigious. | It's a good and unique game. It's worth a try.

* The combat system is dynamic, and you need to be smart and skillful, to win. 

* The PvE aspect is good, it is challenging.

* The Open World PvP is awesome, the deathmatch arenas are good, too.

As an early access game, there is some work to be done. 

* The MOBA arena, needs to be balanced.

* A bit more of PvE content, would be welcome.


As I said before, it's worth to give a try, the game is really good, and it is very promising. | Muito boa a mecanica do jogo gostei bastante com certeza é um dos meus jogos de mmorpg favoritos

 | So far pretty good game. It still needs a bit of work but it is still in Early Access.

It is an Open World MMORPG but has MOBA style arenas to built it. They are for now focusing on PvP but it is not a 100% forced PvP MMORPG.

The three classes are Tamer (pretty much a Mage), Paladin and Ranger. So, yes it needs more classes which I believe they are working on. Can not wait to see how this game turns out over the coming months and years.

I believe it is very much worth the $19.99 price tag. There are NO plans for them to make it a monthly subscription based game. They said no microtransactions will be in the game (yes, that could change maonths or years from now). So it is not a Pay-to-Win MMORPG at all. | Народ ни в коем случае не играйте в эту халтуру.

Видеообзор с геймплеем:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUcAzdAYfbY


Кратко, суть игры в следующем:

Вы собираете отряд (стандартно - танк, хилер, дд-шник) и отправляетесь на уничтожение боссов в чужие подземелья\лабиринты.

В то же время, собираете свое подземелье\лабиринт и ждете атак отрядов соперников. Своим лабиринтом и мобами в нем вы не управляете. Собрали данж, и ждете пока совершат рейд на вас, смотрите результат, прокачиваете босса, меняете колоду. 

Да, это же карточная игра, так что у каждого босса и героя есть своя колода, и по мере прокачивания как тех, так и других, появляется все больше опций для декбилдинга. 

Ожидаемо для ККИ, здесь есть бустеры, система довольно стандартная - их можно покупать за золото, можно за денежку, есть квесты и награды за бои.

Кстати, каждый раз, когда ваше подземелье оказывается непроходимым для соперника, вы получаете 10 пыли, из которой можно крафтить карты. Чем чаще вы отправляетесь в рейды на чужие подземелья, тем чаще вражеские рейды приходят к вам (что выгодно).

Мне игра понравилась, интересный концепт в сочетании с ощущением настольной игры или ролевого приключения.

Пока она в раннем доступе, не слишком много контента, на многих картах отсутсвует арт, не все реализовано, но вангую, что на релизе это будет 8-10 из 10. Конечно же, на мой субъективный вкус. 

Спасибо, что дочитали. | Labyrinth just went free to play, although it's still in Early Access, so I figured I'd leave a review for people to see whether or not it's worth their time. 
Short answer: Yes.. 
Long answer: ...Yess
/REVIEW END -Throws smokebomb .. just kidding.

Quick Review:
It's a tactical battle thingy. It's good. It's free. It's like pokemon, except in 3D, you control awesome heroes, and you battle against mythological monsters. So not really like pokemon but you get the idea.

Labyrinth?
Yeah the name doesn't really show up in google that well, and there's no David Bowie, Jennifer Connelly, Goblin King or Bog of Eternal Stench (yet).

Outline:
You do collect cards from pack to use in battles, which work as your passives, minions(for bosses) and abilities. It plays like a tactical battle game. Currently (in Early Access) single battles take place in a single arena based on the boss. There's no limited ""energy"" system and you can play as much as you want. The cards are balanced (some cards are better, others are situationally better) and every hero and boss is unique in some way.

Currently there are 6 heroes and 6 bosses, eventually there will be at least 2 heroes of every class type and 8+ bosses. The heroes of the same class share cards, besides a few guaranteed hero-specific cards, but you can only field one of each class. Every hero and boss gets at least one permanent passive ability, some armor, and some basic, more than decent cards to begin with.

Bosses each have two classes and choose their minions and actions from those classes.
It is a tile based game and some bosses/minions take up more tiles than others, from 1x1 (human sized) bosses all the way up to 3x3 (giant) bosses, and even 3x3 minions. The size of the bosses and minions has a subtle effect on play as well, and  in the current version the battlefield terrain can be altered, with lava or cracks, during battle. The battlefield terrain alteration mostly occurs around one of the bosses, who is a magma beast. He bleeds torrents of lava when hit, and can spew lava around him as an attack.

Heroes get two basic abilitys, guard and an individual weapon, that don't consume a card and can be used for card draw or to save/use resources. The basic abilities can be upgraded with some cards, e.g. warfare heroes can equip better weapons, the mages can equip a spell book.
The basic hero weapons themselves have their own class which can be affected by cards. E.g. the fire mage's fire spells become swifter at focus 10, which includes her base attack.
The rogue engineer heroine's base attack counts as a ""ranged attack"" for perks and abilities that buff and trigger on those.

Bosses don't have a base attack and have a smaller hand then heroes, allowing you some control over better AI performance and making boss combos more likely. Every day there is a quest that offers a sum of gold worth around 8-10 victories, so if you can only play once a day it is still efficient. You can hold 3 quests at a time, and change them each once.


Old Reviews:
There were more positive reviews from key backers, but due to a steam policy change of only allowing direct purchases to post reviews that count, some diminished.
Hopefully now that it is free to play they can be restored.
There was a critical bug that delayed the free to play update, and they fixed it the same day, meaning that free to play was only delayed by a single day.


Is It Pay 2 Win Though?
It doesn't feel like it.
There's no premium only content. Everything is available to F2P, and the epic/legendary rate is quite high, although the coin rate is low (balanced by rate). You can also craft all of the obtainable cards in the game with a currency you earn from defense(your boss) battles and disenchanting duplicates. You can get an early lead on obtained cards by paying sure, but a lot of the fun comes from building up your deck and improving it.

Casual matchmaking is partially based on how well you do, and of course Ranked mode is, so the tougher your deck, the tougher your opponents in general. It also means that if you're not doing well you'll likely be matched up with F2P decks in future anyway.

It's also somewhat balanced in that, all cards are effective in one way or another, and for perks/minions, they have a card cost of which you can only spend so much. In my experience, well constructed F2P decks and smart play should be able to win against decks with higher rarity/more powerful cards. It also doesn't take that long to reach max level, by rough estimate you could collect most of the current cards in a few months by doing the daily quest everyday.

You can quit at any time, or if you get disconnected from the game at any time, and you will be able to return back to the raid you were in the middle of.


Playtime?
By comparison, I have more hours on Labyrinth in a week than on:
	XCOM 2
	Hitman: Absolution (100% achievements)
	Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen
	One Way Heroics
	Hand of Fate
	Cargo Commander
	Dungeon of the Endless
	Risk of Rain


Did I mention it's free to play now?

Double-click on own units on timebar to see their hand, so you can plan better.
Arrow keys or both mouse buttons to move around field.
RMB to rotate and wheel to zoom in.
In deck selection, RMB to study a summon from summon spell, or craft/disenchant card.
	Guarding is a good way to draw extra cards, since it only costs 1 tick. It's good for Faith if she draws all Heal cards and doesn't need to heal.
Max handsize = appears to be 7, and when you reach 7, you just stop drawing cards until you use them?
You can scroll the sidebar history in a battle to see moves longer than the previous 8 effects.
When watching a replay, use Back in bottom left to exit.
Spacebar can be used to skip turn (use Guard usually).

It's basically two card games plus a role-playing game in one game.  I put over 500 hours into this on PlayStation 5 and just got a PC and got it here too.  There are three characters/stories, and they just get better as you progress.  The world building is deep, and the stories are impressively well written.  There are a few scripted encounters in each story, but there are also random events so no two stories play out exactly the same.  After a battle or negotiation there is a draft where you get to pick one of three random cards for your deck, so there is deck-building too.

缺点是流程通关后，对比纯DBG来说欺诈之地的游戏过程，操作都显得繁琐，因此重玩性并不是很高。
考虑到游戏整体内容的丰富度，对于50块不到的定价来说确实性价比不错，比较适合轻度卡牌玩家游玩，对中毒卡牌玩家特别是杀戮尖塔佬来说可能会有点无聊了。[b]特别是不喜欢看字只喜欢打牌的，别买，买了又退款你也嫌麻烦，要么给差评游戏也冤枉啊。[/b] | 卡组的构建和两个战斗系统的搭配无疑是失败的，或者说，游戏的这两个核心之处带给我的体验是糟糕的。从世界观、人物塑造和美术等方面来说，这是个很好的胚子，可惜为了强行贴合制作组并不擅长卡组构建，这个胚子被糟蹋了，让人叹息。 | Griftlands is a standout gem in the world of strategy and roguelike games. The writing in the campaign is nothing short of brilliant, with dialogue that brings the characters and world to life. Each interaction feels authentic and contributes to the rich tapestry of the story.

One of the game's most intriguing mechanics is the card system, which involves building two separate decks: one for negotiation and one for combat. This dual-deck system adds a layer of strategic depth, allowing players to navigate the game's challenges in multiple ways. The negotiation deck, in particular, shines as it enables players to resolve conflicts and persuade others with cunning and wit.

However, while the card mechanics are innovative, the viability of combat leaves something to be desired. Choosing to engage in battles often comes with significant consequences, which can sometimes make combat feel like a less appealing option compared to negotiation. This aspect could benefit from some balancing to make combat a more rewarding and viable choice.

Despite this, Griftlands is a captivating experience that masterfully blends storytelling and strategy. Its unique mechanics and compelling narrative make it a must-play for fans of the genre. | This is one of the highest-quality games I've ever played. 

The game is basically a deckbuilding, card battling roguelite. There are two types of card battles, each of which uses a different deck. The first type are combat-style battles that are almost exactly as in Slay the Spire (re-skinned, of course). The other kind of card battle is for negotiations, and it uses a different deck. Both types of battles are fun, are very well designed, and are compelling. But these make up only half the gameplay. 

Another quarter of gameplay is having conversations with NPCs as in an RPG. The player's choices in these dialogues result in different rewards or consequences that enrich the risk/reward mechanic and also make the game way more engaging and playful. 

The last (and smallest?) quarter of gameplay is deciding where to go when, buying/destroying cards or pets from merchants, and making allies or enemies. 

If you liked Slay the Spire, I challenge you to try this game.  Although I've only played a few hours of Slay the Spire so far, I think this is an improvement in just about every way. It's deeper, more interactive, has much better graphics and music, supports more play styles, has more types of ""battle"", and so on. 

I have yet to find any bugs."

76561197999259031,607050,Wargroove,11.7,"Indie, Strategy",5,"I've been trying to figure out how best to describe Wargroove, and I've finally settled on ""Advance Wars, but annoying.""

Okay, so the history - I got this game when it first came out, excited to have something to fill the Advance Wars niche that Nintendo was leaving open. Played to Chapter 2-2 in the campaign; dropped it. Since then, them memories of it weren't fond, but the why was a little hazy. I'd vaguely remembered feeling like the gameplay was slow and the balance was a little off... This was the same for most people I've brought Wargroove up to. In the past week, I decided to start playing again so I'd be ready to play it for an archipelago with some friends - I'm several chapters farther now and very concrete about some of the issues the game faces.

The biggest flaw is that Wargroove doesn't respect the player's time. There's the classic Chucklefish way I mean this - the animations are beautiful, and they play way too slow because they want you to see every frame - but Wargroove has it's own fun twists on that. Stages are frequently needlessly long or huge. Campaign levels will usually start with the player at a huge disadvantage - the enemy will begin with half of the field under their control and a small army, while the player will have two buildings and two units and need to scramble to form a front as quickly as possible or they'll never recover from the money deficit. You frequently have to spend way too long just stabilizing, and it makes the map take twice as long as it should. Sometimes it just likes to have characters chime up and shout little nothing barks based on silly conditions. Sometimes it likes to pull little 'gotchas' to come with those, spawning swarms of enemies to join the already better funded and therefore larger, thus making every engagement require extra caution and provide occasional extra barriers, slowing everything down in two ways at once. The enemy will get access to a very powerful ""tank"" unit, the Giant, as early as chapter 2-2, and you will get access to a single indirect unit type to counter it - this will never change; as far as I can tell the player never gets access to recruiting giants through the campaign, while the enemy can recruit these fast, immensely powerful units with very limited counters for a measly 1200 gold. They dispense them like pez while you have to struggle for the resources to A) get your one unit that can counter them fielded, and B) defend it.

These are mostly campaign complaints; I have general balance and gameplay complaints too. The system for the game isn't really as intuitive as Advance Wars - in a lot of ways it plays the same with the forces being mostly lumped into categories of infantry, cavalry, air, water, and tank - but there's also weird little specific quirks to it that take a little time to realize, such as the pikeman being especially strong against the cavalry, or the mage being especially strong against dogs for some reason. The game puts immense emphasis into who attacks first; Where a trade between two of the same unit in Advance Wars will often end in the ballpark of 7HP to 4HP, a trade like that in Wargroove will often end closer to 8HP and 2HP. Frequently, the offensive benefit of striking first outweighs a unit being ""bad"" against its target; Being strong against a unit usually means being offensively able to take it out in one go, but not being strong against a unit usually won't cause them to significantly [i]resist[/i] damage, so it is almost always better to be the one that strikes first so they'll be greatly weakened on their attack.

There's also the town capture and healing systems. When you attack an enemy town, it will defend itself and become neutral again when defeated; run a capture-capable unit to it to capture it. This system isn't bad on the surface, but it can become a huge pain also - you'll need specific unit types to do appreciable damage to towns, and you can sometimes get locked into an irritating loop of needing to re-whittle down a building instead of capturing it because an enemy will run up out of nowhere and give it a smack - sometimes the player also gets to do this; it feels no less annoying to keep burning turns capturing a settlement over and over while waiting for reinforcements to catch up. Units can recover health by walking to a settlement and paying the equivalent health difference worth of gold for their class (eg: if a 100 gold unit is at 2 hp, it costs 80 gold to heal) - but there's the added catch that buildings get 10% HP every turn, and they aren't healing as much as [i]giving away[/i] their HP. I assume this is to make sure that you can't just heal a unit on the frontline forever... but honestly, I wish they would just let me do that - instead healing is this once-ever-10-turns 'treat' that also costs that equivalent of money for the unit anyway, and now the two is ripe to be plucked - everything about it is annoying.

Add to it that I don't feel like I've earned most of my greatest victories on it - sometimes the AI just overextends their commander, and I can just pin them to the corner and pummel them to death while the enemy AI focuses on punching a building or kicking nearby puppies instead of saving them. I don't know what to tell ya, sometimes the program just makes bad decisions.

For positives: There's a critical system for dealing extra damage when conditions are met that's really neat - usually this has to do with what units are positioned nearby and how. I genuinely like this system, even if some conditions are a pain to exploit while others will keep even a dying unit extremely powerful for no effort at all (RE: Giants). And the commanders add a nice layer to the gameplay, although I wish they were a little more different in how they interacted with units instead of just having unique special powers.

It all just feels like Wargroove was super close to something, and I really [i]want[/i] to like it - but there's dozens of little compounding annoyances that slowly make it intensely irritating to play. Not that it's like ""Bad"" in the traditional sense, it's genuinely just a very annoying experience. I find it really difficult to recommend; maybe if you want to focus on the Arcade game mode or mods, it might be alright, but the overall feeling from the vanilla game is an exercise in frustration.

[b]EDIT:[/b] Played through the Arcade a little more and decided that Arcade mode is decidedly [i]fine.[/i] A lot of my complaints about balance still stand, but when you, the player, are given a roughly even starting playing field, mostly smaller stages, the full set of unit options, and no ""gotcha"" moments, you can exploit the issues much more freely and see your gambits materialize more readily - given all the tools, they suddenly the feel more like mechanics than missteps, and it becomes a much more satisfying game to play.

I'm leaving my review as ""not recommended""; I think that the issues with the campaign are significant enough that the main meat of the content is still just not fun to play - but if you're hankering for some Advance Wars like gameplay off Nintendo... You should probably still play WarGroove 2 instead, which includes a second ""roguelite"" arcadey mode, to my understanding, and so has more of the game at its best. | A tactical game similar to Advance Wars with beautiful sprites and great music. The characters are somewhat tropy yet very fun and enjoyable. The editor in Wargroove is brilliant and one of its best features. In addition the coop campaign is a blast to play through with your friend. While I do prefer Advance Wars over this, Wargroove is nonetheless a worthwhile game! | *Género: juego de estrategia por turnos 2D pixelart con ambientación medieval fantástica.

*Historia: sencilla pero entretenida, donde nos ponemos en la piel de Mercia, la nueva reina de Guindal que ha de salvar a su pueblo de un mal ancestral. Además, se puede descargar el DLC gratuito ""Double trouble"" con una nueva campaña. En esta, cogemos el papel de una entrañable familia de bandidos que ha de saquear todo el continente para intentar rescatar a uno de sus miembros de una traicionera miembro del clan.

*Audiovisual: el diseño pixelart es muy detallado, con vistosos mapas y personajes kawais. Las animaciones de batalla están muy logradas, aunque acabarás omitiéndolas para centrarte en la estrategia y aprovechar el tiempo de juego. La música ambiental acompaña perfectamente, disponiendo de un tema principal para cada héroe y sus efectos sonoros cumplen correctamente.

*Duración: año sabático (mucho más de 40h), si quieres completar las dos campañas con sus mapas secundarios. Y este es uno de los pocos juegos en los que conseguir su coleccionable (estrellas) merece la pena, pues desbloquea contenido adicional en forma de imágenes de diseño de personajes, soundtracks e historia sobre la ambientación. No obstante, aunque la duración del juego sea larga, si juegas una escaramuza con las opciones de mapa base, disfrutarás de una partida de 20 a 30 minutos.

*Rejugabilidad: infinita. Cada escaramuza es diferente, gracias a la variedad de mapas para jugar batallas y los abundantes héroes seleccionables (15). Además del modo campaña y escaramuza, dispone del arcade (donde has de superar 5 mapas con un héroe en tres modos de dificultad diferentes para conseguir las estrellas coleccionables) y los puzzles (al igual que hacen en los periódicos con el ajedrez, te ponen una situación de batalla y en un solo turno has de obtener la victoria derrotando al general enemigo o su fortaleza).

*Lo mejor: A) la mecánica de producción de tropas en edificios preestablecidos, dándole mucha importancia a la elección del tipo de tropa a construir cada turno; B) El equilibrio entre las variadas unidades tierra, mar y aire, sus contrapartidas y la importancia dada sobre asestar el primer golpe; C) El logrado componente táctico del despliegue de tropas por la orografía del mapa, al aprovechar los distintos tipo de casilla de terreno, y sobretodo la importancia de la obtención de pueblos como motor económico;  D) El héroe de cada facción que lucha en batalla, lejos de desequilibrar la partida, la complementa tácticamente gracias a su poder de uso ocasional; E) El logrado diseño de la campaña principal cumple perfectamente la función de tutorial para poder dominar los conceptos y mecánicas del juego; F) El editor es muy completo, permitiendo programar escenas animadas entre batallas mediante eventos/acciones; G) Los divertidos diálogos entre los generales durante las batallas de la campaña y el modo arcade, los dota de personalidad y logra aumentar la inmersión en la ambientación; H) Permite jugar en modo cooperativo local; I) La secuencia animada de la presentación está muy lograda, incluso podrían hacer una serie de TV; J) Precio increíble (17€) por la duración que ofrece el juego base y su expansión.

*Lo peor: A) la IA tiene debilidad por el general enemigo, por lo que es fácilmente manipulable hasta en el máximo nivel de dificultad; B) Hay dos unidades excesivamente poderosas (dragón y gólem) que impactan demasiado en la partida, aunque son fáciles de contrarrestar. | A modern twist on the old Advance Wars turn-based tactics formula. There are some subtle, surprising changes to the mechanics, but I think they do a great job of creating an engaging experience for new and old players. I still have a lot more of it to play, but what I've played so far, I have thoroughly enjoyed. | Başlarda baya sıkıcı. Tuhaf bir hikaye ilerleyişi var, spoiler olmasın diye ona girmiyorum.Hikayenin yaklaşık %60-70lik kısmından sonra hava ve su birimleri açılıyor ve bu savaşlardaki taktikselliği artırdığı gibi onları daha da eğlenceli yapıyor. Bunu belirtiyorum çünkü oyunun ortalarına yakım kısımlarında 1-2 görev o kadar sıkıcıydı ki... Bu oyuna 2 ay ara vermem ile sonuçlandı. O noktadan sonra hiç yan görev yapmadan sadece ana görev yaparak oyunu bitirdim. Taktik oyunlarıyla yeni yeni tanışıyorum.İlginç gözüktüğü için denemek istedim ama aradığım tür oyun bu değil. Yine de yapan ekibi takdir ediyorum, yapıkları işe tutku ile bağlı oldukları belli. İçeriği çeşitlendirmek istemişler ve Multiplayer,yan görevler, arcade modu,puzzle modu ve coop hikaye ekleyen bedava dlcyi oyuna eklemişler. Meraklısı hepsini deneyip bitirebilir, bana 20 saat yetti."

- zu wenige Streamer die das Spiel hypen könnten

It also has lore, and fun banter between the characters to read between levels.

But the games monetization is very egregious. Over 200 quids ""worth"" of DLC and an in game store with loot boxes. 
You can get these in game, which is at least a plus, but it feels like an advertisement, the way they are drip fed to you.
And when I say worth, there's a pack in the game, that comes with an autoclicking raccoon (Trash Panda) and some potions, it says it's 35 quids worth at the cost of 15 quid.
That is not 35 quids worth. Some potions and an admittedly very cute, Raccoon are not worth 35 quid... If you think that, then you're just incorrect. Factually false.

If you're content to leave the game on in the background, that's not a problem. You'll eventually get things that will be left in the background. There's also codes you can enter for free chests, which is nice. A point in the games favour.

But I cannot recommend this game, on the basis that it is so greedy. So many micro-transactions. You can potentially spend hundreds of pounds on a game that you leave on in the background.

Основна ідея майже не змінилась – середня по масштабу мапа, кілька точок які треба захопити/втримати, мінімум біганини, максимум веселощів та справжня бійня. Цього разу не на Іводзімі чи в Сталінграді, а у В'єтнамі! Сетинг підійшов досконало – це одна з кращих ігор про Індокитайські війни які я знаю. Запах паленого напалму зранку, ГУКИ НА ДЕРЕВАХ, гуки в будівлях, гуки на будівлях, гуки в тунелях та бункерах, гуки на воді – присутні. Ви й самі можете стати гуком або вже є ним, поки читаєте цю рецензію.

Фракції тут не дзеркальні, як це було у RO1/RO2. Які у RS1 кожна має свої особливості, озброєння та можливості. У RS2 ця концепція сягнула свого апогею. Північани можуть маскуватись, робити пастки, у них потужна артилерія, стрілецька зброя хоч і строката та застаріла але від того не менш смертоносна. Гукам не потрібно пильнувати щоб лідер загону був живим, вони просто риють тунель (по суті точку спауну) і воюють. США до прикладу мають більш уніфіковане та точне озброєння, клеймор ставлять тільки у керованому режимі, домінують у повітрі, мобільно спавняться на лідерах загону. Вони теж дуже сильні у вмілих руках. На мою думку баланс фракцій тут є і він непоганий, решта залежить від гравців. Є ще американські морпіхи, В'єтконг, австралійці та новозеландці, сили саме Республіки В'єтнам. Про них розказувати не буду, досліджуйте та грайте самі.

Замість танків з RO2 у гру додали бойові та транспарантні гелікоптери, зокрема AH-64 Apache (Апачі) та UH-1 Iroquois (він же ж «Х'юі»). Вони дуже класно відтворені, під час пікової популярності гри гравці просто бились та перестрілювались між собою через бажання по-пілотувати одного з цих красунчиків. 

З нововведень також появились як платні, так і безкоштовні скіни. Це класно, коли ви можете на свій смак підібрати зовнішній вигляд бійця, цього так не вистачало у попередніх частинах. Притому скіни тут атмосферні [spoiler](окрім хіба що чудернацьких окулярів з різного кольору скельцями)[/spoiler] та цілком претендують на історичність. Нікуди не ділась фішка з появою потертості уніформи по мірі збільшення рівня гравця, дрібничка але приємна. 

Справжнім прокляттям серії став старий і кривий рушій Unreal Engine 3. Гра повна багів. Дуже бісять постійні лаги та фрізи під час руху, перестрибування перешкод, виставлення пасток, побудови тунелів, кидання димів. Позначки на мапі відображаються некоректно і гравці писали про це на форумах. Через вихід на платформі Epic Games розробники поламали голосовий зв'язок (VOIP), який спробували пофіксити зовсім недавно, але нічого не вдалось – працює через раз. 

Оновлення виходили наскільки я розумію досить рідко, баги не фіксились, тому гра вже почала згасати. Зараз ви ще знайдете людні сервери та уламки колись великої спільноти. Але різні ігрові режими (skirmish, supremacy) вже спочили схоже навіки, досягнення пов'язані з ними отримати практично неможливо. 

Не виправдало себе також бажання розробників додати платне доповнення Green Army Men (GAM) яке навіть на Різдво не оживає, зараз є тільки один сервер і той зазвичай повністю пустує. Наступили на ті ж самі граблі що й розробники Battlefield 1. 

У підсумку гра хороша, атмосферна, креативна та амбітна (по міркам серії) хоч і забагована та напівмертва. Кайф від неї отримати можна й зараз. Благо ціна теж впала. | h2] Rising Storm 2: Vietnam или безжалостные будни Вьетнамской войны! [/h2]

You will hate this game, and then come to love it, and then hate it again, and then go back to loving it. You will go through every single emotion, every stage of grief, the highest of highs and lowest of lows playing this game, struggling at this game, and trying to improve at this game until it etches itself into you like the microplastics in your blood stream. And once it gets it grip on you, it won't let go. You're gonna keep coming back to this game. It won't matter why. Maybe you meshed well with similar games that allow for different play styles. Maybe you're too stubborn to let the game knock you down after losing, maybe it's because games have gotten too stale and that this is your last reliable source of pure, no nonsense gameplay. Even when you think you're done, you're not. Maybe there's a new update and you wanna take a gamble at how broken it is.

It's a game that will ruin slower paced games for you. It's a game with the potential of forming the strongest of bonds with other people. It's a game that will teach you how to get good at games. It's a game with a soundtrack made by someone who thinks he's the shit and has the evidence to back that up. It's a game that goes on sale for $8 that I put 800 hours in without even touching eclipse and having barely dipped my toes into modding.

It's a game.
Not a sad imitation of a movie
Not a glorified storefront or slot machine (although gambling is still present)
It's just pure, unrestricted fun | Игра классная, но почему то разрабы посчитали что мне нельзя купить дополнения к ней | Vine por el meme y mod de Goku, me quedé por la Railgunner y el Bandido.

Simulador de poderes titánicos, inicias debilucho y acabas volviéndote el jefe final de un RPG... luego te mata de un golpe un don nadie y vuelves a empezar.

Desbloqueos constantes, desafíos estimulantes, clases MUY divertidas, objetos icónicos y una jugabilidad simple pero efectivísima.

Mi Rogue-Like favorito, simplemente peak.

10 Ukeleles/10 | OK, this is on my top 5 list of games. It’s fun, has a level of difficulty that seems impossible at the beginning, but after playing for a few hours, it gets easier. The game has close to no meta-progression, making it very skill-based. Even the first survivor you unlock can easily beat Eclipse 8 after you get used to the game. All the survivors are equal in ability (except the Seekers of the Storm ones), and each survivor offers a nice new playstyle, so there is something for everyone.

The item system is awesome. At the beginning of a run, you start with nothing and can die easily, but after getting items, you can feel much stronger. With the ability to scrap your items to print out different ones, the build combinations are endless. You can become a tank that can out-heal almost any enemy in the game, or you could become a glass cannon, dealing insane damage but dying in a single hit. The pacing of the game is near perfect, with the difficulty ramping up the longer you play in a single run. This forces you to make strategic decisions, like whether to go for more items and face stronger enemies or proceed to the next stage with fewer items to keep the enemies weaker.

The fact that this game has multiplayer makes it even better. While playing alone can be fun, playing with a friend is always better. The ability to coordinate with friends to synergize is amazing. One of my favorite combinations is an Engineer using Bustling Fungus (a healing item that can heal tons when you stand still) and a glass cannon of any survivor type (my favorite being Railgunner, a DLC character). The Engineer allows the Railgunner to regenerate all damage instantly, while the Railgunner one-hits everything. While this might make it seem easier, the difficulty in multiplayer increases much faster, balancing things out.

The game has a charming, low-poly art style that works perfectly with the fast-paced gameplay. The stages are beautifully designed, ranging from an arctic military base to floating islands, making the game diverse in its environments. After many hours in the game, they can get slightly repetitive, but overall, they are beautiful and built perfectly, neither too big nor too small, except for one random Stage 1 that is just way too big.

Even though it is a near-perfect game, it is not without flaws. While the lack of meta-progression can feel rewarding and nice for people who enjoy skill-based gameplay, those who prefer persistent upgrades might find the lack of post-run rewards unsatisfying. After 40-50 minutes of gameplay, having to restart can feel frustrating, but that’s kind of what you sign up for when you buy a game in the roguelike genre. For those who are willing to put in the work and learn the mechanics of the game, it can be one of the most fun experiences out there.

The amount of dopamine you get from looping (restarting back at Stage 1 with all your items and difficulty at the same level) and becoming so overpowered that you destroy everything in your path is amazing. And when you finally get so far in the game that you crash it (the true ending), it’s an incredible feeling. That moment is indescribable. It feels amazing.

Overall, amazing, 10/10, please buy it. Don’t bother reading more reviews or questioning whether it’s worth it or not. This is one of the only games I would truly suggest buying, even if it’s not on sale. What are you reading this for? Go buy it! | 我不知道为什么所有人都看起来很认可这款游戏，我真的难绷，进图十分钟杀怪剩下两个小时全在找出口（不夸张真是两个小时），每次找出口都是一次对身心的全方位折磨，找的时间稍微长一点就立马打不动怪了，以及地图场景总是没啥变化，跑哪去都长一样，对我来说单人根本没法玩，联机的匹配也是像猴子遇见现代人，根本毫无游戏体验，删了又下下了又删就是没法相信这款好评如潮的游戏在我手里就烂成这样，这次真是道心破碎了再也不想捡回来继续玩了"

---致我人生第一次玩的卡牌肉鸽神作《杀戮尖塔》
前几日冬促，购买了《杀戮尖塔》这款游戏，在玩之前心里曾想：我玩过那么多个3A大作，怎能会被一个小小的卡牌游戏震撼呢？看着steam好评如潮的评价，心里抱着不理解和尝试的态度，还是打开了游戏。

没错，我摊牌了，我彻底被这个游戏折服，从买完游戏到现在我无时不刻都在玩，目前也差不多一百小时了，如此优秀的游戏玩法和质量已经能超越很多3A大作。

再玩之前，我也确实久仰杀戮尖塔在卡牌肉鸽当中的地位，但是我也确实从来没玩过卡牌肉鸽，《杀戮尖塔》也属于我在肉鸽类游戏中的白月光了吧。确实只有在实际上手之后才能感受到其中的魅力。从最开始的重开在商店里找好遗物，到现在稍微有些对删牌过卡的理解，这种不完全依赖随机而是能够在游戏局内运营、构筑卡牌的机制正是它的魅力所在。同时四个角色特色迥异，相同角色又因为不同的牌组构筑有着不同的打法，再加上几乎毫无门槛的操作，在roguelike游戏的重开-学习的过程中，低挫败感、高成就感、对卡牌的熟悉以及逐渐对角色的理解使得游戏过程不像通常的卡牌roguelike，而更加有趣，能取舍是否该拿牌、是否该移除卡牌、接下来又该怎么构筑，这使该游戏的可重复游玩性大大增加。


前些天终于用战士，猎人和鸡煲把心脏打通关了，也算是对这游戏有些浅薄的理解了

开始玩这游戏的时候，好哥们建议我先玩鸡煲，说是鸡煲转起来特别强，而我也感受到了。

后来哥们和我说，玩战士得学会烧牌，我很诧异，明明每张牌都是我精挑细选的，为什么要把他们烧掉呢？后面理解了，把效率低的卡烧掉后，留下单卡效率最高的卡，打怪效率更高。之后喜欢上了烧牌的感觉，尤其很喜欢腐化，当把其他牌烧干净后，只剩下那几张攻击牌，颇有种破釜沉舟的感觉，就算打不过再sl嘛，把不该烧的牌留下来。

当我研究战士烧牌的时候，我认为战士是一个最需要想象力的职业，玩的时候得靠想象力。

关于杀戮尖塔的赞美太多太多了，我不想去赞美游戏的本身。我印象最深刻的一局是战士第一次打败心脏，因为卡组不太好，强度不高。我腐化黑拥SL一个小时二十次，结局依旧是输。我相信我能赢，我把29张牌牌序列出来，腐化黑拥烧完不同的牌牌序列出来，一个小时后我终于找到了那个解，最后我赢了之后长舒一口气。在那一刻我赢了游戏，在那一刻也赢了时间。或许一个小时我重开一局选牌好早赢了，可是能赢的局我不愿认输。


即使最后我们都会输给时间，这没关系，那也要谱写出每个人自己生命的赞歌。什么是生命的赞歌？或许是藏在人们骨子里的永不屈服、永不妥协、永不认输。

我的人生没办法sl，为了战胜这一路上的小怪，烧过那么多休息牌，娱乐牌，还换了那么多血，这是否真的值得？可惜这个问题的答案没法通过sl去知道了。
现在的我，就想赶快走到下一个篝火休息。人生啊，总是奔向下一个篝火，区别是以前的我会在篝火敲牌，以后我只会休息了。

最后感谢《杀戮尖塔》给我带来一百小时的快乐时光，我现在唯一后悔的就是在大学期末考试期间购买了这款游戏，这游戏真的有瘾啊！😭 | My first 500 hours in Slay the Spire were hours I didn't pay for. 

I was a kid in highschool, broke, there was only 3 characters in the game, Vine was alive and Tiktok had yet to really get a foothold in the world. It was a better time.

And I... sailed the seas. Its not something I'm ashamed of, and if you are down on your luck, still a kid, or just don't feel like jockeying the Steam refund policy to see if you like a game, most game devs would prefer thats how you play their game over buying a copy of dubious origin from a reseller. 

Why even bring this up, you might ask? Well, it was only last year that I realized how much had gone into the game, and that there was a 4th character that I had no clue even existed. And, against my better judgement with regards to my ever disappearing free time, I picked up STS again to try that 4th character. And then I started playing the other characters too. And then I started ascension runs. 

Never in all my days have I encountered such a well crafted deckbuilder. Being singleplayer, STS doesn't care if you find a combo that breaks the game and makes the enemy unable to interact with you. Slay the Spire doesn't try and limit your ceiling, it dares you to go infinite, it [i] wants [/i] you to go infinite. My favorite part of the game is how it encourages offense while putting more than enough wrinkles in your path that you can't just go full zerg rush. Fully indexing into any one thing without accounting for the counters puts you on the path to losing. 

Learning the Watcher, the illusive 4th character I didn't know existed as it got added after I put my 500 [strike] pirated [/strike] pre-purchase hours in has been one of the most enjoyable deckbuilding experiences I've had since... well since I played STS the first time. 

The main thing I was trying to do on the Watcher that was so fun was going infinite. There was a really interesting play pattern you can take where you reset a lot and chop your deck down to like 3 powers and then your 2 card combo that goes until you win. The fun part is that by taking your deck down to so few cards, any enemy that adds cards to your deck in any way is immediately the most threatening thing you could encounter. You also have to make illogical decisions in order to get to infinite. You skip like 90% of cards you are offered, you make sacrifices for some things that would never make sense in a normal run. And that is just ONE way to play the game on one character, completely ignoring everything that comes with ascension runs. 

And all of that is also completely ignoring everything that isn't purely gameplay. The art is amazing, the soundtrack is amazing, the sound DESIGN is amazing, and there has never been a better time to get into Slay the Spire because there is a sequel that looks like its amping up everything about the first game and giving more of what is undeniably one of the grandpappys of indie roguelikes. That would've been a silly statement 10 years ago, but there are so many indie roguelikes now that it can be hard to stand out among them. 

Slay the Spire has stood the test of time and remains at the top of the tower. Play this game, and if you can, uh, pay for it while you're at it... I did. Eventually.

They definitely tried. I would say they succeeded, but didn't really innovate on any mechanics to truly make it stand on its own. |  Final Fantasy tatics é uma parada q eu nunca joguei e ta travada em alguma coletânea de algum console aleatório (ou tu joga em emulador), mas o ponto é que eu não tenho como comparar nada, já que muita gente vem aqui ver se é talvez ""parecido"" com FFTatics.
  Pois bem, eu achei a experiencia nesse jogo muito boa, realmente queria saber o por que as pessoas gostavam tanto desse gênero, e me impressionei com a variedade de classe e ideias que se pode por em um personagem e nas composições, tem varias coisas secretas e um desafio bem equilibrado, eu só não platinei por ter muito grind e necessitar da DLC (Que eu não tenho).
 Concluindo, eu recomendo o jogo em alguma promoção (por que é meio salgado esse preço), já q ele tem uma historia bem interessante e personagens bem variados, alem de ser possível fazer uns combo bem cabuloso. | This is a good tactics game with some unique class leveling and combinations. | Slow, clunky, but a good Tactics RPG in general | This game really is a hidden gem.

While the first impact was not great, particularly in terms of graphics, the game grew on me quickly and within a few hours I knew I was dealing with a very solid title. 

The plot is alright, nothing spectacular but good enough for a game of this genre. Characters are overall likeable. Combat is well designed, maps are different and engaging. But where the game truly shines is the class system and the personalization available to the player. There's huge potential in finding combos, mixing abilities and really giving each unit a unique approach to combat. 

I'd give this game an overall 8 or even 8.5/10."
76561197999259031,368420,Unknown,1.6666666666666667,,0,"I'll be honest. I want there to be a player base for this game. I know it's got a shaky history, especially with those who were expecting Torn Banner Studios to make a ""true"" follow up to Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, but taken apart from that context, this game is, at least to me, more visually interesting, and far more enjoyable an experience. Now, it does have major issues with Ping, some graphics bugs that need to be fixed, and the Devs REALLY need to work on better server connectivity overall, but even with those issues, I feel a great fondness for Mirage.

I enjoy the intregation of combat spells, traps, and projectiles into the combat, I love the simple but fun act of parkouring up a wall to flank an opponent, and I LOVE the colors, the art style, and the map design. It's nice to see something visually different in the hack and slash action genre, and to play a game that just feels... fun. I got my butt kicked several times and still enjoyed the experience, simply because of how unabashedly silly and yet solid it felt as a whole. 

The fact that this game is being shunned, (as far as I can tell), simply because it was not what was initially expected, fills me with frustration. How many sword fighting, fireball slinging games, drenched in far Eastern, Arabian Nights psychadeIic glory, are there? Almost none. I long for warriors to return en masse to these arenas and halls and canyons. I long to wall run through the world, cutting my foes down with technicolor laser beams and cold etched steel, but there's not a soul to be found on the servers anymore.

说说游戏本身和孪生兄弟中世纪骑士一个玩法，就是拿着武器把敌人干倒，血肉横飞是这家公司做游戏的招牌菜。不过上市刚刚解锁就已经看出了鬼服的潜力，玩的人目前不超过100.。延迟高到你怀疑人生，读取时间长的你几乎可以睡一觉，这就是我解锁以后第一局的实际感受，买了的如果期待它以后能改好就留着，不喜欢看着不爽直接退了拉倒。
我不推荐！ | Не пишу обзоры, но несправедливость ситуации вынудила меня сделать исключение.
[b]Примечание: игра взята со скидкой 50%. Наиграл несколько десятков часов в ЗБТ и ОБТ.[/b]

Описывать геймплей я не буду - за меня это неплохо делают всевозможные видео и скриншоты.

Пройдемся лучше по конкретике.


[h1]Откуда такие отрицательные отзывы?[/h1]
В общем и целом, больше половины отрицательных отзывов концентрируют свое внимание на следующем:
[list]
[*] dumbed down combat (""вот в чивалри боевка была лучше, а тут два оружия, пара ударов и ненужная магия"");
[*] низкий онлайн (подробности ниже);
[*] плохая оптимизация;
[*] дисбаланс/баги.
[/list]

Пройдемся по пунктам.

[h1][i]""Вот в чивалри я всех разносил, а тут боевка тупее, ничего сделать не могу""[/i][/h1]
Эти отзывы возникают ровно по той же причине, по которой DLC к Chivalry имеют низкий онлайн - [b]здесь были поправлены  многие баги и эксплоиты[/b], которые присутствовали в оригинальной Chivalry, а именно:
[list]
[*] reverse-оверхэды (удар из-за головы при угле обзора >150 градусов, когда чувак просто наклоняется и убивает у себя за спиной);
[*] сверхчеловеческий drag (в момент удара увеличиваем сенсу и дергаем мышь, получаем моментальный слэш градусов эдак на 180-270, макрос пилится на раз-два);
[*] спам feint'ами (атаками-обманками);
[/list]

Как бы я не любил [b]Chivalry,[/b] у её фан-базы есть большая раковая опухоль - [i]больше 50% игроков играть без вышеперечисленных эксплоитов и макросов не умеют вообще[/i] - исключение составляют редкие иностранные сервера вроде Sneaky Monkeys, где таких гнобят и кикают. В результате новоприбывшие в чивалри либо сразу уходят, увидев эту клоунаду, либо гуглят гайды и начинают делать то же самое.

Здесь же это все (в бОльшей степени) исправлено, разве что драги (на мой взгляд) можно было бы еще немного ограничить по скорости. Но в целом в процессе игры у тебя практически не возникает вопросов [i]""да как так он меня убил-то? Я же заблокировал!""[/i].

В результате приличная доля фан-базы Чивалри поливает эту игру помоями, потому что без багоюза играть они не умеют. Такая вот досада.

Еще в Чивалри часть скинов не соответствует размерам оригинального оружия, выводы делайте сами.

[h1][i]""Я зашел, а сервера пустые""[/i][/h1]
Да, такая проблема действительно есть - народ подтягивается в районе 4-6 часов вечера по МСК (по моим наблюдениям). За конкретной статистикой - смотрите в Steam Charts.
Причины на это ровно две - первая описана в разделе выше, вторая - [b]чуваки из Валв просрали все полимеры в день запуска игры, выпустив её до запланированного времени[/b]. Сервера не были запущены (кроме одного или двух инстансов), кнопка ""Купить"" не работала - в результате те, кто успел купить до этого, зашли в игру, увидели (условно говоря) один пустой австралийский сервер с пингом >150, вышли, написали отрицательный отзыв и вернули свои деньги.

[h1][i]""Игра логаит уже в меню, гамно, рефаунд!!1""[/i][/h1]
Да, игру и правда нельзя сравнить по уровню оптимизации с мастодонтами вроде Battlefield - и использование UE4 не сильно спасает ситуацию, впрочем, есть пара нюансов.

Во-первых, многие пишущие отзывы не утруждают себя заходом в [b]меню настроек[/b] (sic!), поскольку привыкли, что их любимая каэсочка/дотка работают на высоких.
Во-вторых, проблемы в основном возникают в режимах 10v10 - виной тому рэгдоллы, которые по какой-то причине жрут дохрена ЦП (привет, SW Battlefront!), поэтому [i]количество трупов советую скручивать в ноль, если есть просадки по ЦП[/i].
Ну и с графикой тоже лучше не перегибать - некоторые карты весьма загружены мешами/отражениями/GI (не настолько плохо, как в том же WH40k: Eternal Crusade, впрочем).
[i]Умиротворите свой аппетит к красивым картинкам и будет вам счастье с 60+ фпс.[/i]

Баги с лагающими меню уже поправлены в большинстве своем.

Вот два рига, на которых я играю (в обоих случаях разрешение 1920х1080, Win7 x64):
[list]
[*] i5-4690k @ 4.2 Ghz, GTX 750 2Gb, 16 Gb RAM (DDR3) - [b]55-70 фпс[/b] на средне-высоких;
[*] Quad Q9400 @ 3.2 Ghz, R7 360 2Gb, 6 Gb RAM (DDR2) - [b]30-60 фпс[/b] на средних без трупов и с минимумом кровищи.
[/list]

В целом, если потратить немного времени на настройку, играется лучше чем большинство поделок на Unity.

[h1][i]""В чивалри я мог лучником затыкать тяжелого рыцаря ножиком, а тут не могу, плохая игра""[/i][/h1]
Баланс персонажей и карт, как известно, вещь субъективная. Вспоминается поговорка - [i]""каждый хвалит свое болото""[/i].
Проблемы с балансом действительно были, но бОльшая часть была исправлена ещё во время [b]закрытой беты[/b] (кстати, тогда игра в лучшем случае давала мне 30 фпс, это в дополнение к разделу выше).
Здесь нельзя спамом левой кнопкой за ассасиншу разобрать тарана, да. Кулдаун/урон некоторых абилок стоит немного подкрутить, чем разработчики, впрочем, периодически занимаются. Саппорт (тот жирный мужик) полезен и получает очки за лечение. Можно отражать любые снаряды и удары.

[h1]Теории заговоров и прочие нелепости[/h1]
Не буду комментировать отзывы по типу ""ужасная цветовая гамма"" - думаю, все и так понятно (вы же не будете покупать красный телевизор вместо белого потому, что [strike]RED GOES FASTA[/strike] он красный?).
Еще проскакивал отзыв, якобы разработчики банят на форуме, когда пишут про баги - ложь и провокация. Основной человек, который пишет от их лица на форуме - Reithur - наиспокойнейший человек, лучше него с коммьюнити работают разве что ребята из Boundless или Нельсон из Unturned, на мой взгляд (они чаще отвечают). Иными словами, не творите херни и не судимы будете.

Еще есть ""особые"" ребята, которые говорят, что Mordhau лучше (вот только он до сих пор не вышел, а 300к бачей на кикстартере уже давно собрали). Прямо как с Elite: Dangerous и невышедшим до сих пор Star Citizen.

[h1][b]Так стоит покупать игру или нет?[/b][/h1]
Если Вас не пугает низкий онлайн и вы хотите помочь спасти игру от несправедливой смерти - да.
Если Вас бесят баги в Чивалри и вы ищете игру без багов в melee-комбате - да.
Если Вы хотите иметь возможность зайти в любое время и иметь возможность поиграть в любой режим с нормальным количеством людей - не сейчас.
Если Вы не можете в ретроспективу того, как Вы играете и хотите убивать всех нажатием ЛКМ - нет.
Если Вы не хотите, чтобы игру постигла участь King Arthur's Gold или еле-дышащего, но хорошего Guns Of Icarus - черт подери, да.

[i]И да, где-то на форумах проскакивал пост от Рейтура, что планируется добавление [b]PvE[/b]. Могу ошибаться, впрочем, время покажет. Надеюсь, это поможет игре выжить.[/i]



[b]TL; DR:[/b] Виной всему фанбаза (>50%, не будем ровнять всех под одну гребенку) Chivalry и молодчики из Валв, которые испортили день выхода игры. | The game looked interesting at first glance: more variety than Chivalry in classes, added spells, and parrying all types of attacks. However, the game suffers a few flaws.

First and foremost, there is no matchmaking queue or any reason to stick a game out until the end besides rank XP and cosmetics. There aren't many players (at the time of this review the peak player count is 190) so matchmaking seems infeasible, but still it would be nice to have matchmaking with similar skill levels. Since there is no way to know how skilled your teammates and opponents are or get into matches with similarly skilled players, the game can be very frustrating or unsastisfyingly easy. There are few times when a round is actually evenly matched.

Beyond this, there is not much in the game to encourage teamwork. There is no team voice chat for strategizing, only all chat for voice. There is no minimap either just little triangles to show you where teammates are but they don't specify distance either. If your team is spread out, it is hard to tell where people are since their triangles can be in all directions and not immediately visible when looking a particular direction. It would be a lot better if there were systems in place to encourage teamwork, since it is common for a team to sit on the objectives as a full team and never really get pushed off for the entire duration of the game while the other team trickles in one at a time--not realizing that their teammates are all dead. This is a tough situation since even getting 2v1'd is a very one sided experience, and there are no real escape abilities of the characters. If you find yourself battling 2 opponents, you are pretty much dead with no way out.

Further, there are no alternative objectives on the map such as health packs, cooldown reductions, speed boosts, etc. that provide battle incentives. The only similar objects are small ""Jinn"" that drop when an opponent dies which gives a small cooldown reduction and a small health bonus.

As far as the spells go, they are okay with most of them being pretty obvious and not really offering much complexity. For example, there is a boulder, a whirling swing move, a few jump-then-slam moves, and some wide range magic spells. There is one spell that could be used as an escape, Phase, but it is very short in movement and time active. The spells themselves have very long cooldowns of 10 to 30 seconds, even if you kill an enemy and pick up a Jinn you only get about -3 seconds, which is tiny compared to the actual spell cooldown. Often, this translates to killing the first enemy with spells and then any subsequent enemy must be killed with only your weapons. For a game that is trying to add abilities and variety to the PvP slasher genre, this feels like it's tacked on to the format rather than being really integral to combat. Personally, I think the combat would be more interesting with a more diverse set of spells that aren't all just damage spells (aside from like 3) that have lower cooldowns and maybe a little bit less damage. Escapes and manueverability spells would really add to the game.

Speaking of manueverability, the only way to sprint is to hold run until it automatically makes you sprint. There is no toggleable sprint, which is a shame. For a game that already has a stamina bar, it would be really nice to have a stamina-based sprint and a roll/side-step in the game on every character. This would make combat a lot more interesting especially when getting outnumbered.

Finally, the tutorial is really cryptic. There are no HUD elements that let you know if you are parrying or riposteing correctly. There is apparently animation cancelling in the game to chain attacks together, but it is not clear when you do this correctly in the tutorial or in the game because there is no feedback. It also doesn't seem like the animations get very much shorter at all. It would be nice if there was a mode that teaches how to do this correctly with feedback and an indication in game when you animation cancel.

The maps themselves look pretty good though, as well as the cosmetic items.

In sum, there are a lot of things wrong with this game that make it seem clunky and basic. There is certainly depth to the game as far as the weapon combat goes, but the spells don't add much to that. The trailer shows a lot of spell use, but in reality they are few and far between since the cooldowns are so long. However, the two most important criticisms in my opinion are the lack of a rating-based matchmaking system and the lack of a toggleable sprint and roll/side-step. The former makes matches very one-sided pretty consistently since you can play against total noobs or beta veterans and the latter makes combat very parry based and not at all reliant on positioning and disengaging/re-engaging combat.

If they would add these two things and rework the spells to feel less like they are tacked onto chivalry, this would be a really fun game, however, without these I cannot recommend this game at all. | All in all I find this game quite fun, and if you're a fan of timing based, free-form melee combat I definitely suggest it! I'll be going through some of the pros and cons of the game below, as well as any personal gripes or issues I have had thus far:

Pros: 
-Great classes- All 6 of the classes are fun and satisfying to play, though some are have a larger skill gap than others. They all play quite uniquely as their weapons and abilities vary. 

-Fun game modes- All 3 of the game modes are a lot of fun, My personal favorites being 3v3 Arena and 6v6 objective. 10v10 Team Deathmatch is also a lot of fun if you want to just let loose and do some killing without having to worry too much about tactics. 

-Interesting colour palettes and aesthetics- Though some people dislike the games art style, I quite enjoy it, too many games are all greys and browns now a days!

-Simple but interesting maps- The maps play quite well, none of them are overcomplicated and balanced well enough that it would be difficult for a team to camp one spot for long. As objectives move closer to the defenders spawns things become much more intense and can lead to some really interesting comeback or draw moments. 

-High Skill cieling- Combat between high level players is really fun to watch and play! Due to the removal of reverse overheads and the like Combinations of abiliites and normal attacks allow you to mix up the fighting in ways that players can still counter if they are quick enough. 

Cons:
-Low player count- This is probably one of the biggest issues at the moment, one which can only really be adressed over time as the game gathers people that enjoy the mechanics and stick with the game rather than Rage quitting. Even with the low player count, I don't typically have much trouble finding or starting a server in peak hours, and simply hopping into an empty server often fills up pretty quick if there aren't any others up. 

-Unbalanced teams can be frustrating- Due to how the game is balanced, full lobbies are a ton of fun, but when one team doesn't have as many players as the other (Be it caused by rage quitters, or simply uneven numbers in a server) it becomes very one-sided unless the handicapped team has people good enough to carry and make up for it.  Team objective can be especially frustrating when you are a player down.

-Performance issues in 10v10- This is potentially an issue with my own setup (GTX 1070, Radeon 9590 4.7ghz, 16GB RAM) but I see a huge performance drop when servers have any more than 14 people. At 12 people I get about 60-70 FPS, and once any more than that join, it drops down to about 30-40 FPS, which in a timing based melee slasher such as this is basically unplayable. Turning down settings seems to make no difference, which causes me to suspect it is some type of CPU optimization issue, or bottlenecking on my end


All that being said, if you like the idea of a class based, Small team melee slasher with abilities and magic mixed in, I definitely recommend it. While some mechanics are similar to the games predecessor chivalry; Do not expect this to be chivalry 2. The small teams and abilities make it play more like Overwatch than chivalry, though the old melee slasher style combat is still present. I personally think it adds another layer of complexity, but there is definitely a lot of dislike and hate towards the game from the old CHiv community. 

If you like melee combat, Team based gameplay, and magic, Don't let the Ex-chiv player hate train and the small population discourage you from buying. The community is small but pretty tightly knit, and always  willing to answer questions and help new players get used to the gameplay and changes from Chivalry."

文本观赏性很强，非常洛式风味，好吃！ | Pros: 
Lots to explore, 12 hours in on first playthrough i probably touched the surface
Interesting worldbuilding and cool systems
Can be very addictive once you've gotten used to the system

Cons: 
- Many tasks feel like grinding. A lot of repetitiveness, be it work, reading books or studying skills. E.g. to improve your [spoiler]  ""reason"" [/spoiler] skill you have to  combine 8 [spoiler] ""Erudition"" [/spoiler]  which takes 60 seconds each to combine, and 60 seconds to make, all on timers before they run out... 

- The way cards get added to your field sucks ass and is beyond annoying, just dumping them wherever with no possibility to have a dedicated place for a certain type of card. Let me have all books in one place, all vitality in another etc... being unable to stack cards with different timers is also extremly annoying and creates a mess all the time. 

Overall, a 6/10 which would be probably a 7 or 8 if the quality of life wasn't so miserable at points. 

If you like management in games | This game is a passionate love affair I keep coming back to.  It's not something I recommend to everyone (honestly I don't think any game is, but this one is more ""has a highly specific target audience"" than most) - you have to be some combination of a fiddly detail obsessive, wiki-diver, and opaque lore-enjoyer to really get the most out of it.  

Watching the previews will give a decent sense of the actual gameplay, which I would have difficulty describing, but the *feeling* of playing the game can't really be communicated as easily, I think.  Cultist Sim is incredibly atmospheric, and a lot better at creating interesting tension than a few gameplay clips can really convey.  The timer progression is such an integral part of not just the mechanics, but the mood.  Is your current Dream action (20 seconds remaining) going to turn up the card you need to dispel part of the Fascination counter (45 seconds remaining) currently spelling your doom?  etc.  

Also, it pays to actually read the descriptive text on things - it will all sound like pretentious bullshit at first, but there is a kind of shockingly cohesive, deep, and interesting setting and story going on, here, behind all the timer-watching.

My one main criticism is that it is really, really bad at teaching you how to play it.  I'd recommend spending a few minutes on youtube to help get the basics down; there are a lot of aspects of the game that are satisfying to find out in an exploratory manner, but the basics of stuff like, how to recruit and promote Followers are not that.  Thankfully, the fan wiki is also excellent, and basically an essential resource if you get in deep."

You don't have to play long to recognise if the game is for you because the rules of the game are always so clear. The only thing that limits you is the rules you create, and it really makes you think about every move.

Highly recommend, 9/10 | 伟大的游戏。目前我最喜欢的类推箱子解谜游戏。
传统推箱子解谜在现代游戏逐渐式微的原因我认为是腾挪的反馈不高，关卡也很难做出独特性，一个关卡接一个关卡可能看起来都很相似（不是说设计不出来，而是设计所需要的难度更高——这方面做到极致的目前是Maxwell's puzzling demon）。Baba Is You重视思路而轻腾挪使得每一个关卡都更为有趣，能够表达的内容也更加丰富。 | This is an amazing puzzle game, and the best kind.  It's a very simple idea that allows for incredibly interesting and continually novel interactions among the parts of the game.  The art is simple but cute and each time I solve a puzzle I feel a genuine sense of achievement.  Unlike most puzzle games, the more difficult puzzles aren't made by simply putting more moving parts into the machine and making things complicated, but instead are increasingly clever applications of existing methods and occasional additions of new methods.

The core idea is that each level has rules that are set by simple sentences built out of blocks of text.  BABA IS YOU, for instance, means that the player controls Baba.  If you push any part of that sentence out of the way, it breaks, and you no longer control Baba.  Depending on how you push the text, that could mean you've failed the round or it could mean that now you've got control of a key, or a rock, or something else entirely.  The player has to figure out how to use, or more often change, existing rules in order to reach the winning condition.  It's surprisingly fun and challenging. | This is a phenomenal game but very hard, I highly recommend playing with a hint page or even two open and not being ashamed to check them most levels later in the game. I've been following the hints on a blog called keyofw which does good subtle hints, then when their hints are too subtle checking a YouTube playlist called ""Baba is you- solutions- walkthrough"" by Alayric, which has allowed me to finish nearly all the levels but still get the joy of figuring things out half the time or more."

До этого играл в бесплатные версии начиная с первой части, и начиная с неё мне и начала заходить вселенная асасинов. А тут уже раскошелился на лицензию, ибо меня всегда манила тема древнего Египта и пирамид. И разрабы не подвели, вся тема древнего Египта прям хороша, всегда мечтал побегать по пирамидам и расхитить гробницы) Было приятно поиграть за мужитского мужика и по нагибать всяких нелюдей. Да серия сасинов отошла от основ начиная с этой части, но надо же было куда то развиваться что бы не стоять на месте. Для меня эта игра норм, да как и все части вышедшие после, ибо я любитель открытых миров и их зачистки. Лично для меня от убейсофта осталось ток 2 серии в которые я буду играть из части в части сколько бы они их бесконечно не выпускали, это Асасин и фар краи)
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3410487292
Сама игра лично для меня просто средняя, и мне в ней понравилась больше всего тема Египта, поэтому оценка будет высокая) История более менее, главные герои нормальные, что Баек такой мужичок красавчик что его дама сердца норм. Сама игра более взрослая что ли, сразу видно сделана мужиком, сам Баек прям тестостероновый самец с нормальными мужицкими диалогами и подкатами к жёнушке, плюс куча насилия и моментами если выловить то и сисками) хотя такое и в прошлых играх встречалось, но после пройденных мною некоторых современных стерилизованных новинок (типо бога войны и хорайзена, ибо современная  сони боится кровищи и сисек) это приятно видеть. Было прикольно увидеть Клеопатру и Цезаря с их высокомерием и личной хоть какой то историей. Ибо мне всегда интересна была тема историчности игр серии ассасинов, хоть она и не на 100% правда, но всегда было приятно оказаться в той или иной эпохе и увидеть тех или иных знаменитых личностей с их характерами, ибо где мы такое ещё увидим, в играх уж мало где. А так это всё тот же сасин, скучные не запоминающиеся квесты и сотня аванпостов) я блин не один квест не запомнил, а их вроде 180 штук... Я блин в Ведьмаке чуть ли не каждый квест запомнил, но тут они сделаны на столько слабо что пройдя игру мне запомнился только сюжет) А ведь игра то не маленькая, примерно на 70 - 100 часов, и тебе уже под конец начинает всё осточертеть. Вот что делает прохождение с зачисткой карты на 100%, и мне как перфекционисту приходится это делать) Мне уже страшно осознавать то что мне придётся проходить Одиссею, а там вообще жопа, зачистка всего на 150 часов) ну ничего, я постепенно вырабатываю иммунитет и привыкаю к такому унынию) Лучше бы конечно они уменьшили всё и сделали более качественно, но ладно, имеем что имеем. Ну и на последок, режим тура просто топ, много интересного рассказывают о древнем Египте, при этом ты сам бродишь по всем значимым местам и видишь всё это дело как классно воссоздали разрабы, и тут сразу видно что было вложено много работы в игру, хотелось бы что то подобное видеть и в других играх, если не об истории то о том как создавался тот или иной аспект игры.

不足：后期极高的探图重复度，开放却又不又完全开放的罐头模式实在有点无聊= =
PS：期待下一步影能有些新内容和玩法！ | While it was a bit of a struggle to try and find out why this game would crash all the time for me, just capping your FPS between 60-100 FPS seems to get the job done, you may still crash from time to time however. That and some fps drops during cutscenes are the only problems I ran into. Besides that, game runs flawlessly.

Its not fair to compare Origins to any AC games that came before, due to how different they are in nature, but this game has no right being this good. It easily ranks among the best AC games ever made, despite how different it may be to the previous entries. Egypt is genuinely an incredible map, probably the best one in all of the AC games, and not only is it fun to traverse and explore, but landmarks like Alexandria make you feel like you are inside of a painting. The story is very good too, this time we experience the creation of the Assassin brotherhood under the name of the hidden ones. Bayek is one of the most likable protagonists EVER in the entire franchise, and his character is further enhanced thanks to an incredible performance by voice actor Abubakar Salim. The rest of the characters are good too, but some of them just pop in and out of the story randomly which really doesn't help me care about them too much. Gameplay-wise, problems arise. Stealth and parkour have been butchered, it was a public execution. At least combat makes up for this in a way by being a lot more in depth than either stealth or parkour, but its a shame to see AC go further away from its roots. If you go into Origins expecting a good Assassin experience, forget it. What you WILL get is a very good, solid, exploration based action rpg. 

DLCs are ok. Just like the base game The Hidden Ones and Curse of the Pharaohs are both set in breathtaking environments but all they really do is expand the story, not much else. More Bayek is a good excuse to me. Deluxe pack comes with a bonus mission, so does the season pass. Horus and Roman Centurion packs are all cosmetics.

The Gloomhaven game which was released by Flaming Fowl Studios is a decent game; very good graphics for a game of this type, interfaces are a bit clunky, a few things needed tweaking, but overall a 7/10. This negative review is not for them although the game still needed polishing at the time it changed hands.
This negative review is for the peabrains at Embracer Group who somehow managed to dumpster the PC version of the game without actually changing anything. Multiplayer has become effectively unplayable due to the servers dropping players if they lag for more than 0.02 seconds. Despite the existence of a Steam Community Workshop, modding is quite literally unplayable: if you close the game, it will rename your modded campaign's save files to something which game can no longer read. I Googled it and it looks like someone on Github made a plugin which might fix it, but I've honestly had it with this game.
The straw which broke the camel's back was playing >60h of a campaign before realising that the ""enhancements carry over after retiring a character"" setting was switched off; then starting over, playing the new campaign 40h, and then realising that no, the problem is that the setting no longer works. I then found a ""free enhancements"" mod which I was gonna use to replicate the functionality - but hey, guess what! Modded campaigns are also broken.
Anyway, yeah, another broken title - welcome to 2025. Don't waste time or give money to yet another garbage gaming company, just play it on TTS for free. (And please support the Cephalofair game creators, they are amazing.) | Gloomhaven the tabletop is a great, fun experience that comes in a box the size of a small child.

Gloomhaven the video game is a MISERABLE multiplayer experience. Constant disconnects and loading errors. Which is a shame, because automating a bunch of the game is a great idea. Some effects in the game just don't work either sometimes. For example, there's a map where you're supposed to be pushed around by the wind every turn, and it just...didn't...

One other thing, I just can't understand how the visibility check tool works...very unclear.

I can't recommend getting this unless you're going to play solo at this time. Try the TTS mod or if possible, get the physical version. | Tabletop > this version.

That being said, both are absolute masterpieces in my eyes. If you have ever played the OG game, you will understand. It is such an elaborate board game and I am pleased with the way it translated to online play. 

The game offers solo adventure and group campaigns. This online version is actually more beginner friendly and eases you into it nicely. I really like the lore and the voice acting they have incorporated. You get to pick from a vast array of mercenaries (and unlock more along the way), you get to choose a personal mission to work towards throughout the game and you can customize your player deck and equipment. 

I can appreciate how much work must have gone into making this adaptation and that's why I love it so much. What I don't love are the bugs and glitches that I encounter on a regular basis when I am in the full swing of a campaign with friends. It is easily resolved with a hard reset of the game but it is still annoying. Thank god the game saves every player round >.>

Even with the resets, I have spent over 140 hours in this game and I have enjoyed every moment. No regrets.

I would recommend getting both versions of this game, seriously. Such an amazing dungeon crawling experience <3

P.S. please make Frosthaven x | This has to be the worst way to play Gloomhaven.  I'm bummed out this has been my only experience with the title.  I would recommend instead going and using one of the many, many comprehensive Gloomhaven deployments for Tabletop Simulator instead.  This is a buggy mess, with a terrible interface, and those bugs and glitches will cost you hours of your life. | This game can be brilliant at times, but it's also a constant rollercoaster of frustration.

[h2] 1: Difficulty is Nonsense [/h2]

The difficulty curve of Gloomhaven is literally, by far, the worst I've experienced in any game ever. As you learn the basic rules, you will start out getting absolutely slammed by every scenario even on Easy and everything will feel completely unfair. As you learn to play your cards correctly and your characters unlock perks, cards, gear, and enchantments, you will start to get noticeably more powerful, and will probably bump to Normal or even Hard. And then, just when the ""flow"" state really sets in and you're enjoying the clever tactics and synergy of your party, your characters start retiring. And you don't get a choice about this - if your Personal Quest is complete, that mercenary is deleted.

The ruleset *claims* that this is a victory - you've unlocked a new character! And they will even start with a bonus perk! Unfortunately, without all those levels, items, and perks (not to mention having to learn one or more new characters), the game is suddenly stupidly hard again. You see, even though monsters ""scale"" to your level, they don't scale anywhere near enough. Normal for Party Level 1 (0 gold) and Normal for Party Level 5 (400+ gold in items and enchants) are radically different difficulties, and you will be forced to repeatedly retire and reset back down to sh*tty new characters frequently in your campaign.

[h2] 2: Events Are Total BS [/h2]

Most Road and City events in this game are a binary choice between A and B, and you don't get information on what clicking either button will actually do. Despite this, some of them carry SEVERE negatives like losing 10s of gold, losing checkmarks (3 checkmarks unlock a perk, so losing checkmarks is the worst feeling in the world. imagine if you could lose talent points in WoW just for clicking the wrong dialogue option in a quest), or harsh penalties at the start of your next scenario (remember the difficulty rant above? well what if you randomly started combat with 3 damage and Poison on all your characters too).

And it would be more understandable if events were generally positive, with some risk involved - you'd feel mostly rewarded, with the occasional bad beat. Or if they consistently presented you with clues as to how to approach them. But no - roughly 20% of the time, both A and B choices are negative, and 60% of the time one does nothing / one is negative. And sometimes the designers punish you for being safe, while sometimes they punish you for being bold. There's even several pairs of events with text that is IDENTICAL, except for a single word (e.g. ""red"" vs ""white"") that flips the outcome. Overall, this event system was probably meant to be ""immersive"", but it really just feels crushing and unfun. The constant risk of a terrible outcome encourages players to google spoilers for every event so they don't get screwed by a coin flip.

[h2] 3: Balance and Gameplay Design [/h2]

For how beloved this game, a lot of the balance and design in it is honestly.... iffy. For example, as you play the campaign, you frequently loot new items - some are even Rare, and are limited to just 1 in your party. And almost all of them are worse than the 10-30g starting items you get in the first 20% of the game. There is never any reason not to vendor 90% of the cool ""loot"" you find and just spend it on enchantments instead.

Classes are in a similar boat - there are very clear S-tier and D-tier choices here, and depending on what you unlock, you may just get stuck in a loop of remaking the same class you just retired.

Enemy ability decks have some wildly OP things in them (e.g. an Initiative 5 card that will go before 99% of characters and make that monster virtually invulnerable for the round), which can make some combat turns feel more like rock-paper-scissors than an interesting tactics game.

On the character side, there is also lots and LOTS of cheese, and the most powerful strategies are all about how much you can cheese and exploit the broken mechanics. Go invisible in every door, find a broken card and Stamina Pot it back 3 times, instakills, mind control, etc. Sometimes the scenarios feel like a satisfying puzzle, or you get use fun synergies and combos. Other times you just find a gimmick and abuse it over and over.

[h2] 4: Digital Problems [/h2]

Gloomhaven was a board game first. The digital game is a huge convenience for automating the monster behaviour and not requiring 30 minutes of fiddling with tokens just to set up a scenario. The digital game is also a clusterf*ck of bad UI and half-finished implementations that will require you to keep a PDF of the rulebook open on your 2nd monitor if you actually want to play the game.

Some especially bad offenders here:
- The game doesn't show you the map or any of the special scenario rules in the screen where you choose cards and battle goals. This is a TACTICS game, meaning your loadout is extremely dependent on the scenario goals and parameters - for example, you may need lots of healing to keep allied NPCs alive, you may need to disarm traps (or push enemies into them), you may need lots of burst AoE damage, or pure single-target. In the board game this is all open information before you start. In the video game, you need to consult an out-of-game PDF or do a clunky Start - Abandon - Back to Map - Travel sequence to redo the whole thing. This is not a one-off, but a *frequent* issue that comes up in almost every scenario.
- Sometimes the combat UI shows you Personal Quests, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it shows you Battle Goals, sometimes it doesn't. It's all over the place.
- Certain UI prompts will lock you out of panning or zooming the camera, so you can't see what's going on in another part of the battlefield.
- Certain UI prompts will lock you out of seeing the items or cards available on your characters.
- A lot of items are quite buggy, and the UI can simply break if you press items or elements in the wrong order.
- The Restart Round button only works on your turn, so if you misclicked something on an enemy's turn, you may have completely f*cked the battle.
- Even after you enter combat, a lot of scenario rules, especially with regards to spawning monsters or upcoming events, are simply not explained at all. In the board game, if a monster spawns at hex F in Round 9, this is open information. If a boss teleports between hexes A-B-C-D, this is open information. In the digital game, it may not tell you why, how, or when things happen at all in a number of scenarios. This is actually where I got so tilted that I decided to write this review - the endgame [spoiler]Dark Rider[/spoiler] boss fight was so poorly explained that I had to spend an hour googling its AI, rules, and strategy.
- The Solo Scenarios DLC also seems like it was rushed and has a number of issues - see the negative reviews on that page.

In summary, Gloomhaven has some brilliant ideas and one of the most clever and fascinating card rulesets of all time. It is also extremely, extremely frustrating to play, and keeps finding new ways to disappoint and infuriate you even 75 hours into your playthrough."

简单适合新手入门的rts游戏，打骨折十几块非常适合入手，战役内容多价格便宜，推荐买完全版，两个dlc质量还可以。
1.这游戏的弓箭手非常强，但是要注意弓箭手的站位，尽可能在地方两翼或者友方背后较远处，千万不能拉倒友军单位的近身后，因为弓箭是有抛物线的，太近了你会看到大大的友军击杀。
2.战斗中单位是拉不走的，可以点击一下撤退，是往最近的大本营方向撤退一段距离，具体多远要看单位移动速度，双击撤离是直接回到大本营，在到地方之前无法进行操作，如果想拉走单位只能采用单击撤离。
3.单位战斗是有体积碰撞的，所以经常会看到f2a过去后面的单位罚站的情况，所以很不推荐f2a操作，最好让单位分散开，从不同方向进攻敌人能充分保证每个单位都在干活且可以对敌人上侧袭或者背后袭击debuff。
4.建筑方面比较简单，都是固定位置建造，建筑种类也比较少，没有什么太多的操作和规划玩法。
5.现在还有一定的在线人数，不过pvp玩家比较少了，绝大部分时间还是在玩单人战役或者遭遇战。

AND give a discount to those who already own portions.

For me this is the best Mars colony building sim. Plenty of structures, everything is well made and engage grey cells. This is kind of strategy that you will hold to for a while and think about how to improve on your last gameplay. Strongly recommended.
[/h1] | After so many hours of fun I really do recommend the game.
You basically start with some drone, build some basic buildings for energy and materials. Then you start building domes to have citizens on mars. It has a good balance so that you always have to do something. It's not perfect, but good enough. Not everything is perfectly clear how it works, but it's good enough. And there are some ""stories"" that might bring you in a locked state after a while and might not be resolved without restarting the game. But all in all it's really fun. | The game is very fun!!

76561197999259031,807120,Iratus: Lord of the Dead,6.566666666666666,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",11,"The game is a fun Darkest-Dungeon-like, but it is ultimately too slow and repetitive for its own good. In darkest dungeon, you're characters only ever level up 6 times. That makes each time they level up feel super valuable. In this game, your characters level up constantly and because of that, each level isn't nearly as impactful. So you spend a lot of time looking at stats and adjusting them slightly, especially once you unlock the building to help level characters which you aren't sending into battle. 

Not only that, but some of the characters are just straight up way more useful than others. As the game progresses, it tries to introduce more risk reward mechanics. Characters hurting themselves or buffing the enemy to deal extra damage and such. But in a game where losing one character means losing so much progress, you never want to hurt your own minions or buff the enemy, because it is just more effective to use minions which deal damage consistently (or have AoE effects which just make every other ability inefficient). So you end up alternating between maybe two-thirds of the minions you have and trying to avoid using the rest as much as possible. Because this game isn't as complex as Darkest Dungeon, where some heroes really shine in specific encounters but are terrible in others, these kinds of mechanics just end up feeling more frustrating than anything else. It also takes so long to unlock new kinds of minions, because instead of them having a chance to randomly encounter them, you have to meet certain thresholds to do so.

The number of trinkets available to place on your minions is also criminally low and many of the mechanics, like building your own trinkets or going on quests feel under baked. They don't adjust relative to everything else as you and your minions level up, so they end up feeling obsolete relatively early in the game. Maybe if I played the game longer and got into those really difficult later levels, I would feel some sense of scarcity and appreciation for these mechanics. But as it is, I don't have the patience to keep grinding that long. 

Finally, the ""hardcore tactical rogue-like"" gameplay contrasts heavily with the ""boobs and blood"" aesthetic of the game. I wouldn't mind the weird objectification of what are essentially dead bodies so much if the game just committed to being a cheesy romp. But the crypt-keeper puns and juvenile visuals don't complement the tactical decision making. The main voice actor does a great job, but the material he's working with doesn't do him any favors. In Darkest Dungeon, you want to hear Wayne June's little comments about the game. The timber of his voice and the quality of his dialogue adds to the game, it doesn't become an annoying detraction after a few hours. 

So, yeah, it's fun and tense when you first start out, but as it unfortunately becomes a slog. If you can get it on sale, it's got a few hours of discovery and enjoyment before the cracks start to show. | Очень доволен этой игрой, хотя по началу думал об этой игре примерно так: ""блин выглядит как Darkest dungeon, а мне он не зашел, наверно и эта игра не зайдет, но попробую раз игра по хорошей скидке"". По итогу эта игра цепляет и затягивает своим хорошим визуалом, субъективно стилистически лучше упомянутого dd, а сам концепт игры подкупает тем, что гг - главный антогонист, что в играх встречается редко. В игре есть хорошая реиграбельность и вполне адекватное количество контента на пару прохождений игры уж точно, советую к прохождению. | love the game, but after some time i couldnt start my game anymore without getting a bluescreen of death. | You travel through randomly-generated maps that remind one of Slay the Spire - a few different paths with different basic encounter types along each path you can see before you choose a direction.

要求控制器是可以接受的，但这个只能本地联机是不是不太好，上一次见到类似操作的游戏是《人类一败涂地》（只是指的是欢乐向+角色难控制），说实话我觉得任何一款以欢乐为目的，打着多人tag的游戏都应该去做好远程联机而不是只能去找一个碰巧手柄在手边的朋友或者一个人坐牢，仅代表个人看法。

[h1]Negative:[/h1]
Controls and how the character responds to my inputs suck. Sometimes he can't start running on the first try or does it with a delay if he's close to an interactive object. Why? I don't know.
During battles, it literally kills me (but just in the game). The target-assist system always sucks, but if you get punished for targeting the wrong enemy, it makes you suffer because you might not even do it, but you still get punished just because that's how the game works.
The time stop after every hit is... I don't find this a good idea, but okay. The worst part is that you get a longer time stop if you land a ""perfect"" hit. And that just breaks the whole process. I wanna f**king SCREAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM how bad it is. Sometimes my character just stands still, literally, while I spam my buttons, even when not in time stop. Maybe it's some ""interesting mechanic,"" I don't know, but it makes everything worse. I wanna cry in that moment, literally.
And I have a problem with grabs, the most powerful action in this game. Just when I want to grab, my character goes into this ""AFK"" state. Maybe I just can't get used to it, and it's my skill issue, but it's still not intuitive and not friendly.
Narrator is boring.

[b]Spoiler:[/b]
[spoiler]In one scenario, the protagonist was kissed by a cat, but after he was killed, before he died completely, he realized that she loves him. So, okay, what truth did I get? I got the truth that the bunny is a traitor, of course he is, but why did they add the part where she kisses him and confesses her feelings? Just for what? I still need to figure out the truth about her feelings. That's frustrating. This sucks.[/spoiler]
[h1]General things / Neutral:[/h1]
Choices without choices: the problem with every game that claims to have ""choices."" They never give you real freedom, not even within the ""game borders."" Thankfully, we have fixed 4 choices for each ending (I don't know about the ""truth""), because I don't need to predict my last choice. But still, I can't relate to what it is MY choice and not the protagonist's, because sometimes he does something I don't want him to do. That gives such a frustrating experience. But this is a story about someone else, not me, right? It's up to you, but I don't like it. Honestly, when he does what I want without additional choices, it feels really good. Thanks that this exists, not too often, but still.
Battles aren't hard; they made them similar to a beat 'em up, with the main focus on crowd control.
I didn't find this story is interesting. Like. So-so or even a little worse.
[h1]Positive:[/h1]
Thanks that I don't need to find every chest in the game to get my max-level swords and stones. Thanks that I don't need to grind for them. Thanks that I don't need to grind through every ending to get the ""truth,"" just 4 specific scenarios. Thanks that I don't need any levels for my character or items to beat the enemy. Thanks that the game still encourages me to be proactive and reactive enough in battle, and there is a reward for it (not a great one, but... still something). Interesting implementation of mouse controls where you need to click on the enemy. Lol, it's like playing a point-and-click action game, ha-ha.
And it's so cool that they even added a feature where, if you drop an enemy's shield while flying, it can stagger other enemies. That's awesome! And you can grab an enemy and use them as a live shield. | Não diria que eu aprovo nem reprovo esse jogo. Monótono demais, sem sal. Pra um jogo de escolhas ele é extremamente linear e o fator replay é quase nulo. No entanto, a história é bem feita, os personagens tem carisma e é uma experiência casual divertida. Minha principal reclamação é que não exista um botão de pular diálogos. Eu me apliquei a pegar todos os achievements, mas pra fazer isso é um grind desgraçado, você tem que fazer todos os finais e ver os mesmos diálogos de novo e de novo toda vez, além de matar uma quantidade interminável de inimigos em batalhas exatamente iguais toda vez.

It doesn't hurt like getting stabbed or beat up, though. It's like paying a woman $20 to kick you in the testicles. I have done both of these things and I have to say, I prefer Noita. | Noita is a very unique game and I highly recommend you to pick it up! With its two main selling points being wand building and alchemy, I am sure there are many other reviews focusing on what the game is, what it does well and what not. Most importantly however, this game is [b]extremely[/b] difficult, hence why I decided instead to give some very important help for all the beginners out there. This review does contain [b]spoilers[/b], however I truly believe you need to hear these things if you don’t want to suffer for the first 50 - 100 hours playing this game. Also even after reading everything I have to say, you will still be left with enough content to discover on your own.

[h2] The beginner player [/h2]
If you just picked up this game there are some very important points to consider before jumping strait into your first run, or rather your first death (which will come rather earlier then later).

(B1) This game is [b]extremely difficult[/b], I really can’t emphasize this enough. You will die a lot and it will often be caused by total bullshit. I once got [url= https://imgur.com/a/ukko-snipe-bfWzzwj]sniped by an Ukko[/url] while in the holy mountain (safe area)... I don’t know how he got there, but that is Noita for you. The earlier you can accept this fact the better. Don’t despair over ""getting Noita’d""!

(B2) Early on you will lose a lot of your HP from [b]random ticks of damage[/b], e.g. stepping on lava, stepping on toxic sludge, catching fire, etc… Luckily there is a very easy fix to all these issues: WATER. Your very first priority in the first level should be finding some water. Also don’t forget to hotkey your water flask (I use my right mouse button since it is that important). While wet you cannot catch on fire, water turns lava into harmless rock, and it turns toxic sludge into more water. So always stay wet and get used to squirting ;)

(B3) Speaking of [b]hotkeys[/b]: You should set up and get used to hotkeys for your first one to three wands and one to two items. Always using those slots for the same purposes e.g. wand 1 = DPS, wand 2 = movement, wand 3 = digging, item 1 = water, item 2 = tablet (you can throw the stone tablets, which one of can always be found right of the first level, before the lava lake, at enemies dealing massive damage), will build muscle memory and reduce at least the chaos that is caused by miss clicking wands / items.

(B4) Are you a [b]greedy person[/b]? Is it really worth losing 20 HP because you jumped into a pool of lava just to get that singular small gold nugget? The obvious answer is: No! Starting out with Noita you might value gold much more than you should. And while yes you need some gold to be able to buy spells / wands at the holy mountain shops, it really stops holding its value rapidly after just a few levels. A good benchmark to keep in mind is to collect >600 gold in level 1, >800 gold in level 2 (which can be very easily done by digging the gold veins found here!), and >1000 gold in level 3. After that point enemies start dropping so much gold that you really don’t need to worry anymore.

(B5) Last tip for the true beginner. If you start your run with either Levitatium (potion that makes you fly up much higher) or any explosive wand that can shoot a little hole in the side of the mountain you spawn in front of, you can actually [b]go up instead of down[/b]! On the top of the mountain you will find the mountain alter, which contains a so called ""orb of true knowledge"" which gives you a +25 max HP boost (first time collecting it unlocks some spell though) and a tablet. Offering this tablet to the gods by throwing it at the alter you get rewarded with about 100 gold. So depending on your starting layout you can start your run with +25 max HP and +100 gold!

[h2] The intermediate player [/h2]
Having played this game for about 10 to 50 hours most players hit the intermediate wall. This is where you kind of understand the basics of the game, but haven’t actually acquired enough skill in any of its systems to consistently leave the first few levels alive. [b]DO NOT DESPAIR![/b] Every player hits this point and if you can push through it, the game will truly open itself to you.

(I1) The main issue now is a well… [b]skill issue[/b]. So what do you do about it? In my opinion the best thing is to focus on is one area at a time. At this point you hopefully minimized the little tick damage from the environment (remember point B2 above about staying hydrated?), so the next big source of damage are the actual enemies. The enemies in this game have ridiculous aim, to the point where if you don’t move they WILL hit you. However, this game is very consistent with its dodging. Basically all attacks have some sort of visual or audio clue when to dodge. For example, the Hiisi shotgunner will always chug his shotgun before shooting. If you get used to flying up or down whenever you hear this sound he will never hit you again.

(I2) Taking about enemies, learn to [b]outplay them[/b]. Many enemies, despite them seeming way too strong for the level they first appear in, have significant weaknesses. Robocop not caring about your spark bolds? Well throw some concentrated mana at him, since he is made from metal, it will make very quick work of him. Satan is haunting you in the Mines? Try showing him a nice little puddle of water... turns out he is allergic! Hiisi CEO spawns a million employees? Just stay directly above or below them and watch how they won’t even try to shoot you.

(I3) Generally speaking this stage is where you absolutely should watch some [b]guides[/b], join the discord and ask for some help, read through some wiki pages etc. Look at the end of this review to find some recommendations I highly suggest you engage with. Please realize that this game is one of those, where you kind of need to look at the wiki while playing. Obviously it gets better the more knowledge you accumulate but at first just keep an eye on there while playing. A good habit is to just pull up the wiki page for whatever new spell / item you find and quickly skim through it.

[b]I CANT PUT MORE CHARACTERS IN MY REVIEW, SO THE REST IS IN THE COMMENTS LOL[/b] | noita，之前在朋友的账号上玩过，当时什么都不懂，死了两百多次，一次都没通关，后来趁着促销买了，兴奋地上手，兴奋地死亡。这个游戏的地图特别大......
故事剧情：
翡翠石板
翡翠石板的文字看不懂的话只需要在它身边待一小会或者拿着石板一小会，但由于翡翠石板上的文字是没有被翻译的，所以你可以去创意工坊找一下那种翻译石板的模组（不过有极大可能影响成就的完成）。
翻译
noita全部的故事剧情都是被隐藏起来的，你可以在很多处地方看得到那些符号。那些是密文。也就是他们的文字。在noita wiki有相应的译码表。那些无处不在的符号，还有那些独特的建筑物，都是noita剧情的一部分。
隐藏密文
有的密文会被隐藏起来，不少是在书、翡翠石板上都是有提示的，需要你自己来解密。而有些密文没有解密的途径，它们需要通过你富有创造力的大脑想出的点子从而付诸的行动来找到。
noita与卡勒瓦拉
noita的不少剧情与芬兰的神话——《卡勒瓦拉》有关系。你可以买下那本书，然后结合译码表，找寻noita中的剧情秘密……
我想，通过自我的发掘而看到了noita世界的神秘，是对于你玩noita的疲惫的身心的一种鼓舞。
视觉画面：
法杖
法杖的外表很大程度上能决定法杖的性能，而法杖的外表也有很不错的欣赏价值。许多法杖都可以画出一条对称轴，那种对称美是很不错的。
法术
单个的法术造成的视觉效果是不足以称得上是美丽的，只有通过尝试，把许多法术组装成一组法术链，释放的时候，你会为此感到高兴，快乐。你也可以学着其他noita优势火力学说的玩家组装出来他们创造出来的法术链，当你释放的那一刻，你也是很激动开心的。
建筑
noita的特殊建筑也有一种美感。举个例子，冥想方块是一个“3D化”物体，而它的内部——冥想房间，试图为玩家打造出一个3D化空间。另一个例子，从世界的整体来看，如果粗略地看，世界中有好几个建筑呈对称。
音乐音效：
背景音乐
每当你进入到一块不同的区域时，该区域的音乐就会播放，我认为，这些背景音乐很契合当时的区域。
音效
把音乐做到与画面契合是第一重要，把音效做到与画面契合是第二重要（因为已经有第一重要了）。怪物的行为都有相对应的音效，而且很明显，其中的攻击音效有利于你避免死亡。因为许多怪物的攻击都有延迟——即攻击前摇。
玩法机制：
毅力
noita是开放世界，你可以打通圣山七层，你也可以向上飞打通天空八层，或者向下穿凿，打通地狱八层。或者，穿越东西，前往那些平行世界，或者，献祭三宝磨，前往新世界+。
创造力
noita最大的玩法就是法术编辑。一套完美的输出用法术链可以让你横行霸道，人挡杀人神挡杀神。而一套快速的行路用法术链可以让你堪比地球公转速度。如果你觉得一个法术很没用，伤害视情况而定，比如石头，但如果你尝试为它组装一套法术链——比如（加速追踪）（石头）。你会知道什么叫快速死亡。
想象力
在noita有不有趣的机制。当你有了意念力踢击这个天赋，你是否会尝试把宝箱带到雪山祭坛那里？或者把翡翠石板带点那里？当你发现了笛子或者康特琴，你是不是想吹一曲？你发现了沙漏或者埋葬之眼，是不是想泼点东西在里面？
优化适配：视情况而定。noita中存在的实体太多，你再强的电脑也会跟老年机一样。
缺点：
如同noita wiki说的，最强大的同时也是最弱的敌人，就是我自己——米纳。
米纳太脆，敌人太强。米纳没有无敌帧。noita是款地图特别大的游戏，主线已经很难完成，支线——种太阳，种暗日，双日交融，解除贪婪诅咒……都需要很长时间。而它的死亡机制就是，死了一切全部重来。除非你已经完成了相对应的任务并看到了结果，否则你还是倒头重来。
像素卡位。这是特别让我感到恶心的。有时候你开路或者打怪，突然不知道怎么回事卡住了，动不了，任由米纳浮空乱举手，特别是在打怪时候，如果你不能迅速拿出黑洞法术或者崩塌法术又或者飞钩、小型传送等等很安全或者比较安全的破坏地形的法术或者移动类法术。等你的只有重开或者乱按WASDF。 | 途中まで慎重に進めてたのに強力な杖を拾ってから急に気が大きくなってその杖の魔法で自爆した
死因の半分くらいこんな調子になってる | About as ""true roguelike"" as a game can come. With the exception of a few spells unlocked by [spoiler]defeating secret bosses[/spoiler], The only thing you keep between games is your own knowledge of the Noita's mechanics. The game is hard, and you'll die a lot, but you learn from each one. It won't teach you anything outright because you're expected to learn by experimenting. A tablet you can find in-game reads, ""The sacrifice of oneself to the pursuit of knowledge is the highest tribute to the gods.""

Rarely will a death be the result of the game being unfair- you're the one to blame 99% of the time. And so you learn that you should always carry water in case you get set on fire or covered in toxic sludge, or you learn to not fire off wands without checking what spells they carry.

Tinkering with wands between levels is where the game's true complexity shines. Good things happen when you add a chainsaw and multicast to a wand with a trigger spell that creates explosions at its impact point.

Noita may give you it's toughest battles, but you are it's strongest alchemist. And remember- True Knowledge is not offered for free."

We all contribute to the game in our own ways, but it’s clear to see each of our preferences. For me, Valheim truly checks all the boxes for an engaging and immersive experience. | [h1] Valheim: отличные идеи, зажатые в рамках искусственных ограничений. [/h1]

Valheim — это замечательный сурвайвал, в котором идеально сочетаются исследование и строительство. Игра впечатляет своим графическим стилем и атмосферным саунд-дизайном, погружая в мир викингов. Казалось бы, всё для идеальной игры на месте. Но чем дольше играешь, тем больше замечаешь, что разработчики будто намеренно вставляют тебе палки в колёса. Тут почти каждая механика не просто усложняет тебе жизнь, а делает это максимально раздражающе.

[h2] Инвентарь и грузоподъемность: гениальные решения.[/h2]
В игре у персонажа 32 слота инвентаря. Казалось бы, что этого достаточно. Но 10-12 из них заняты экипировкой (броня, оружие, инструменты и стрелы). Выходишь из дома, а треть инвентаря [b]уже забита[/b], а в оставшиеся слоты моментально попадает случайный хлам: семена, смола, ягоды, шкуры, мясо, камни, дерево. Никаких рюкзаков/сумок или отдельных слотов под броню и оружие в игре нет. То есть получить дополнительные ячейки инвентаря мы никак не можем (без модов). Далее, вы ограничены по весу предметов. Да, это логично, но весовые ограничения смехотворно маленькие, а металлы (в том числе руда) [b]ВЕСЯТ ДОХРЕНА.[/b]
Единственный способ увеличить переносимый вес — это пояс, который можно купить у торговца. Конечно найдите его сперва, а потом накопите золота на покупку. А теперь внимание: пояс занимает слот [b]аксессуара.[/b] А что еще вешается в этот слот? О, всего-лишь важные предметы, которые помогут вам в других поздних биомах! Например, душка с болот, без которой трудно искать серебро, или светлячок, без которого туманные земли — сплошное бельмо на экране. И как вишенка на торте: металлы и руды (а так же ядра суртлинга и некоторые другие ВАЖНЫЕ предметы) нельзя переносить через порталы! Вы любите гринд? Вам придется переть руду на телеге по ужасным дорогам или плавать на корабле, рискуя утонуть с грузом. Причём разработчики ввели возможность перебрасывать металлы через порталы... но только в самом конце игры, когда это уже не нужно! Ну класс, спасибо!

[h2]Сундуки: вам их понадобится слишком много.[/h2]
10 слотов в стандартном деревянном сундуке — это смех. При этом нормальные сундуки открываются на более поздних стадиях игры, но требуют ресурсы, которые нужны для крафта оружия и снаряжения (армированный сундук 24 слота, сундук из черного металла 32). А сундуков нужно просто [b]ТОННЫ,[/b] потому что инвентарь маленький, переносимый вес крошечный, а ресурсов требуется очень много. В итоге на базе ты чувствуешь себя не викингом, а скорее кладовщиком.

[h2]Крафт и грейды: готовьтесь гриндить.[/h2]
Создание оружия и брони — это нормально, я это даже приветствую. Но вот их улучшение превращается в ад. Например, чтобы прокачать железный меч до максимального уровня, нужно 80 железа. Для этого вам нужно перенести около 800 единиц веса на собственном горбу до плавильни. Это в 2,5 раза больше, чем может носить персонаж!. Давайте возьмем другой пример — меч грейдом пониже, бронзовый. Для его крафта и полного грейда нужно 32 бронзы. Вроде бы не много, да? Но бронза производится из меди и олова по соотношению 2 к 1. То есть нам нужно 64 меди и 32 олова, а это почти 900 единиц веса нужно будет перенести у себя в кармашке до плавильни! При максимальной грузоподъемности персонажа в 300!!! А ведь железо потом нужно будет добывать в болотах, таскать его пешком или на корабле... и всё это ради каких-то +7 к урону?
Представляете сколько беготни туда-сюда вам предстоит? И так абсолютно со всеми металлами. Любой грейд требует чудовищного количества ресурсов, растягивая игровой процесс до абсурда. Разработчики явно решили, что игроки не должны получать удовольствие, а должны страдать.
[b]Разбор предметов? Да не, сжигайте их к чертям.[/b] Вам больше не нужна старая дубинка, топор или кирка? Разберите их на ресурсы. А, стоп, нельзя? Можно только уничтожить? Да и то, только если вы скрафтите специальную постройку. Окей... логично... наверное.

[h2]Выравнивание земли — настоящее испытание.[/h2]
Хотите построить красивую базу? Будьте готовы к тому, что выравнивание земли — худшая механика в игре. Оно работает ужасно криво, требует кучу времени и [strike]нервов[/strike] стамины, а идеальной ровности добиться очень сложно. Каждый раз, когда ты пытаешься сделать ровную поверхность, игра будто издевается над тобой. А так же, как по мне, генерация ландшафта в игре через чур холмистая, что тоже наваливает проблем. Если бы механика выравнивания работала лучше или хотя бы была возможность проще находить более ровные участки для строительства, это сильно упростило бы процесс и сделало бы игру менее раздражающей в этом аспекте. Особенно учитывая, сколько времени и ресурсов уходит на выравнивание. Особенно сильно в этом плане напрягает постоянная нехватка стамины. О, кстати о ней.

[h2]Стамина, которая кончается моментально, восстанавливается вечность.[/h2]
Стамина в игре расходуется на всё: бег, прыжки, плавание, перекаты, атаки, стрельбу из лука, блок, строительство, выравнивание земли, работу в огороде и много еще на что.
Идея классная, но баланс — тихий ужас. Стамина тратится [b]КАТАСТРОФИЧЕСКИ[/b] быстро и восстанавливается очень медленно. Да, в игре есть бафф бодрости, который ускоряет её реген, но максимальная длительность этого баффа около 30 минут. Если комфорт минимальный, то он длится... [b]ВОСЕМЬ[/b] минут. При чём есть куча дебаффов, которые режут реген (например холод и сырость). В итоге ты постоянно выдыхаешься, что замедляет твоё развитие. Любая активность превращается в мучение.

[h2]Еда: вечный голод — вечная проблема.[/h2]
Да, в игре из-за голода вы не умрете, но еда дает временные бонусы к ХП и стамине. Мне нравится эта механика, но проблема в том, что эффект быстро ослабевает. Вот ты наготовил себе стак мяса, покушал, пошел делать дела. Спустя 10 минут эффект от мяса ослабевает на столько, что ты вынужден съесть еще. А потом еще и еще. В итоге ты вечно голоден, вечно жрешь и постоянно добываешь новые продукты, потому что старые кончаются быстрее, чем ты успеваешь вздохнуть. Да продлите вы эффект от еды, ей богу, 20 минут это катастрофически мало.

[h2]Кузницы, верстаки и плавильни: зачем их столько?[/h2]
Ты доходишь до нового биома, у тебя появляется новая кузница/верстак/плавильня... но старые по прежнему нужны!
Новая плавильня выглядит круто, но не может переплавлять медь, олово и железо, только черный металл и огнеметалл. Почему? Какого черта? Новая кузница не заменяет старую, а просто становится дополнительной. Почему бы не сделать один универсальный плавильный агрегат? Новый верстак? Да, но старый тоже остается, потому что без него старые рецепты недоступны. В итоге у тебя база превращается в какой-то завод, заставленный разными станками и печками.

[h2]Итог.[/h2]
Valheim — это игра с потрясающей атмосферой, но чудовищно неудобными геймплейными решениями. У игры огромный потенциал, но вместо того чтобы сделать её сложной, разработчики сделали её попросту неудобной. Здесь слишком много лишних ограничений и искусственного усложнения: маленький инвентарь, ограниченный переносимый вес, невозможность переносить руду через порталы, бесконечный гринд, неудобные сундуки... Всё это не делает игру интереснее, это просто раздражает. Да, можно отключить рейды мобов, можно включить перенос руды через порталы, но почему я должен вручную исправлять неудобства, которые были добавлены в игру намеренно?
Если вам нравится страдать, эта игра для вас. Если нет — готовьтесь терпеть жесточайший гринд или ищите моды, которые исправят глупые ограничения. Игра предлагает вам стать викингом, но вместо боёв и приключений ты большую часть времени проводишь, таская руду, копаясь в сундуках и страдая от перегруза. | Hiç istemeyerek girip hiç çıkmak istemediğim bir oyun oldu aşırı keyif verici arkadaşlarla ve türünün en iyisi oyun içi içeriği aşırı dolu boş vakit geçirmiyorsun oyunda öyle bir oyun düşünün ara ara aklınıza geliyor Valheim başlayalım diyorsunuz . | Really simple but pretty game.

76561197999259031,835570,Conqueror's Blade,0.0,"Action, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Strategy, Free To Play",0,"Well lets be honest here this game could have been amazing but of course the community doesn't help with things, we will get into all that later in the review.

For now lets go over the Pros and Cons.

Pros:
- Gameplay is very addicting and fun
- Lots of units, even with most being worthless
- Open world, even with it too being worthless
- Quite a few classes, of course most must be nerfed to the ground

Cons:
- The community
- Competitive aspect played through discord
- Pay to win has been involved for many years now, even with people thinking it hasn't
- Meta units and classes, if everyone uses the same units and classes whats the point?
- They glitched the glamour system for many, including me that removes your beards on your glamours, causing you to look far different with your glamours you invested thousands in

So lets get into the community first, everyone knows with these games theres always people that know best, or want people to play how they want you to play, example if they rush in and die in a simple casual mode they will rage, cry and whine the entire match, they can have seven to eight deaths and sit there spending literally half the game time on respawn timer crying about their team, this becomes personal and people will hold grudges, just from simple casual matches.. so then it goes into the next and if they get on a team they will always cause further issues, to the point they violate the rules over and over. 

Now put this into play with competitive, people can ruin peoples entire seasons just with being babies or accepting toxic groups of players into their guilds, as the community is so small you simply cannot escape these issues and its repeated literally every season.

Casual is fun at times, just block things out, but overall if you play competitive, the game is literally hand in hand with Discord, I would honestly go as far to say serious guilds spend more time on discord dictating who gets whats, how things will go, what will happen and so on each season, ruining the entire aspect of competitive gaming. You can try to play a season but guilds will merge, hop skip jump around, toxic people accepted, toxic groups accepted, they cause issues, jump to the next and rinse and repeat each season forming this disgusting pattern that literally ruins the desire. Why people would want to reward this system is beyond my understanding.

Glamour system is amazing - well use to be until they caused glitches within their own system by adding a ""New tab and Old tab"" for customizing your charc, You want to mix and match attires to look your best most times, so you equip stuff and boom over 90% of your attires helmet no longer work because they change your face to some androgynous looking disgusting model. This system of course is to much for them to care about just keep spending money okay? They will add new models with crappy beards and other junk, spend more and more it will be fine. 

Overall this game was one of my favorites for years, we've been here since the start but now days its not even fun in the slightest, I would recommend it to people if they wanted to just play it every now and again, not getting involved with anyone or any guild. Other than that, stay away. Far away.

3/10 | muy buen juego el balanceo entre las clases es buena y aun mejores graficos se ve estupendo y sobre la nueva temporada no hay palabras un 10.

[b]Сюжет и атмосфера:[/b]
[i]Сюжет игры Among Us начинается с возвращения межзвездного космического корабля домой после опасного путешествия. Часть команды заражена инопланетными мозговыми паразитами, которые превращают их в саботажников с жаждой убийства.

 | [b]Among Us took the gaming world by storm, proving that sometimes, the simplest games create the most unforgettable moments. Whether you're completing tasks like a diligent crewmate or plotting deception as an imposter, this game is all about strategy, teamwork, and betrayal.

The gameplay is easy to understand but leads to intense, hilarious, and sometimes frustrating interactions. One moment, you're quietly fixing wires, and the next, you're passionately defending yourself in an emergency meeting after being falsely accused. The mix of deduction and deception makes every round unpredictable and fun.

What makes Among Us special is the social experience. It thrives on communication (and miscommunication), whether you're playing with friends or random players. The joy of convincing others to vote someone off, only to realize they were innocent, creates endless entertainment.

Visually, it's simple and colorful, with cute character designs that contrast the brutal reality of getting ejected into space. The sound design, from the satisfying task completion beeps to the ominous kill animations, adds to the tension.

While Among Us is at its best with a group of friends, public lobbies can be hit-or-miss, depending on how people play. The game has also evolved with new roles, maps, and customization options, keeping things fresh for long-time players.

In conclusion, Among Us is a fantastic party game that blends strategy and chaos in the best way possible. It’s proof that great multiplayer experiences don’t need complex mechanics—just a solid concept and the right group of people. If you love games that test friendships and create hilarious memories, this one’s a must-play![/b]"

补充：实际上直接找到游戏文件夹（STEAM-库-Prismata-右键-属性-游戏文件夹，把steam彻底关闭退出后台，直接运行游戏，不会调用steam，不计时...... | As someone who can only play StarCraft 2 with ~50APM and failed to defend fast pool everytime, I really love Prismata. A very complex and interesting turn based strategy game. Even as a professional mathematician, I find puzzles and matches in this game deep, hard and very exciting. Different from most of the modern card/turn based strategy games, this game has almost no RNG (except the coinflip in the beginning of each match, and randomized advanced units, which are the same for both side), and all information is open to both side, so calculation and prediction play very very important role here.

The learning curve is somehow steep. More or less like a good RTS game, there are things to memorize: common openings, tricks and trades... But luckliy, there are very good articles about these aspects already: google Prismata library. Once you get over the basics, every game becomes very exciting and unique.

That said, this game is not for everyone. It is for those people who like rigorous strategy and calculation, and hate the gamble effect RNG brings. A very unique game, also well polished. And somehow to my surprise, the in game chat and the community is very friendly, helpful and very warmful towards new players. 

 | This game is the absolute pinnacle of turn-based strategy. It is really a surprise I only heard about this game now, a few days after the release on steam, even though the game has existed for over 3 years I heard. And why you definitely SHOULD buy this game? Here are a few examples of my reasons behind my decision to get Prismata:
- I like chess, I've played HS, Gwent, Duel of Champions, Fire Emblem and loads of other different turn based strategy games, but I have never come across anything like Prismata before. The combination of no RNG(apart from coinflip, which has around the same effect as chess) and very complex game mechanics which need to be perfectly executed or you literally can lose instantly, really creates a very competetive and interesting game environment, where you always feel you can improve gameplaywise after any given game.
- Prismata has been made super-indie, by only a couple of people and because of that has a completely different mindset compared to for example Duel of Champions, which is another game I also loved, although it was shut down by Ubisoft. The developers have clearly emphazised how much it means for them to create a no-p2w environment where you don't have to grind for the cards, or anything, although this is not a card game but a resource management game. Completely opposed to for example the ""pay until you are broke"" - method which sounds like to be the monetization option for Valve's newest ""strategy"" game Artifact and many other similar games in 1v1 strategy genre in general.
- The developers have come up with a really clever solution to prevent the game from every getting solved, or repetitive, as the available ""card"" pool for both players is partly randomized every game. And yes for both players means both players have the same options, in every game, negating most balance issues with cards being overpowered or too weak, as you cannot choose what to take with you ingame.
- The lack of deckbuilding was a weird thought for me at first, but it actually is the perfect solution for any game like this. The reason why card games or other strategy games which involve deck building of some kind get tiresome rather quickly, unless new cards are added very often, which has its own issues with balancing and older cards getting useless and price for new players etc. Although I repeat, this is NOT a card game even though it maybe might seem like one when you take a first look at the UI, I feel that comparisons to popular card games work well with this game, as the strategy is in the end somewhat similar, just without the surprise factor of your opponent having a hand you cannot see. When the options are open to inspection for both players, the mindgames really kick in. And as every game is different and you have to figure out a new strategy for every given game, and also look out for what your opponent is doing, the game will never feel stale!
- Since steam release although the success isn't like HS level, I have had no trouble finding opponents when queueing. Also the AI is really challenging and the single player missions are already so difficult that it feels like they have a lot more content than they  actually do, funnily enough. I like the art style of the game even though I have seen many people calling it ""cheap"" or ""mobile like"", but tbh I think for such a small development team the art style is more than good enough, and main plus I'd say every unit at least feels unique and distinct, thanks to the artwork.
- Main positive is the mechanics though, but explaining all those in a single review might take a little too long, but I just say that after turn one, literally anything is possible. The units have cool combos and setting up situations where you will end up ahead in the long run is crucial to winning any game, and the key is WHEN to do things or not.

Negatives:
-Price of the game can feel a bit high (around 21€ for me with the first DLC) but it did feel worth it for me after I played a while. The game will likely be free to play some point but I wouldn't wait for it as the founder edition has some cool bonuses, like letting you unlock the various skins and other cosmetics for the units a lot easier. Talk about supporting a great game!
- The skill ceiling is REALLY HIGH, like yeah this game is not for everyone, it can feel overwhelming without any experience about these kind of strategy games, and it will take a while even for more experienced puzzle solvers like me to get the hang of it. But if you feel like you are up for a challenge, you will get it.
- If you require GWENT level of art, then maybe this game is not for you. | 卡在界面进不去，开加速也不行，希望官方能提供一个解决办法，不止我一个人遇到了。游戏先好评支持了。 | Summary:  Prismata is turn-based Starcraft meets Magic: the Gathering.  It's recommended if you like the resource management and build optimization of Starcraft, but find unit micromanagement frustrating.  Also recommended if you like the tactical gameplay of Magic: the Gathering, but dislike the cost of collecting cards and dislike games being determined by which player draws the right cards.

Pros: 
- Deep and unique strategic gameplay
- All players on an even playing field
- Every game plays out differently
- Excellent, non-cheating AI with a broad range of difficulties
- Rich support for competitive play
- Very affordable

Cons:
- Small, hardcore playerbase
- Sometimes makes me feel dumb
- Skins only obtainable through a microtransaction slot machine

Prismata is one of those rare genre-innovator games for which it is difficult to make direct comparisions to other games, but which is, in retrospect, surprising that something similar hasn't been done before.  The best summary is ""Starcraft, the card game.""

Over the course of a match, you and your opponent will take turns building units by spending resources in exchange for playing cards to form a tableu of units, selecting some units to attack your opponent, and managing your defenses.  However, instead of playing units from a hand of cards, they are built from a card pool which allows all units to be built at any time, provided you have the required resources available.  This unit pool of fifteen to twenty-two units is randomly generated at the start of each match from a library of more than one hundred options, changing the optimal strategy each game, and rewarding the player more able to adapt their own strategy to the available choices.

The units themselves are purchased using five different categories of resources.  At the start of a match, you start with two engineers, which produce energy, and a handful of drones, which produce gold.  (The first player gets six drones, and the second player gets seven.)  You can use energy to produce more drones, and use gold to purchase other units and structures.  These structures produce additional red, green and blue resources, which are further required to buy more advanced units.

Some units are purely economic, others can attack your opponent, others defend against attacks, and some can do both.  Many of the more expensive units have an ability which you can choose to activate once a turn, perhaps spending some resources, perhaps making that unit unavailable to defend, in exchange for some positive effect.  The five categories of resources, the wide variety of units with unique effects, and the attacking and defending phases bring to mind Magic: the Gathering as a gameplay comparison.  However, unlike Magic, the same units are available to both players during the game, and unlike Magic, there is no need to buy card packs in order to get access to units.

Because the only randomness during the match is the selection of units available, and because the same units are available to both players, the winner of a match is determined only by he who makes the best decisions.  This can be very rewarding when you win, but when you lose, there isn't anything to blame but your own poor performance.  This isn't Hearthstone, where you can shift the blame to the random number generator.  This isn't League of Legends, where you can scapegoat your teammates.

The high learning curve of Prismata and lack of random elements means that acquiring the skills required to succeed against other players can be a frustrating experience.  This is particularly the case because the player population is somewhat small, with less than two hundred players online at any given time, and quite hardcore.  If you are the sort of player that is easily frustrated by losing, this may not the game for you.  However, if you respond to a losing streak by trying to analyze your mistakes and attempt to ""git gud"", to put it in the parlance of our subculture, then Prismata will be a rewarding.

The game does provide the tools for improving your performance.  There is a replay system allow you to review your mistakes and do ""what-if"" scenarios to see if different decisions would have led to better results.  You can also spectate top-level players in-game, making the game itself a rich environment to learn from the best.

Mitigating the initially brutal multiplayer experience is a lengthy set of single-player battle training missions.  These missions walk you through available tactics and strategies for effective Prismata play.  You can expect to spend twenty hours or more progressing through the single player content.  Also available is a very capable AI opponent, with many difficulty settings, which should allow anyone to find the right level of challenge.  

Currently, Prismata is available through Steam for $25 USD, and the value for dollar at that price point is very generous.  However, be aware that Prismata will, in the future, be a free-to-play game with microtransactions.  The full gameplay experience will be available for free.  Whales will be on even footing with the completely free-to-play player.

However, skins for your units are acquired through a microtransaction slot machine which seems optimally designed to bilk the potential problem gambler.  A trifecta of exploitation makes this so:  difficult to estimate probabilities, cognitive biases about loss aversion, and an in-game currency creating psychological distance from real-world dollar value.  Of course, these skins are cosmetic only, providing no in-game advantage, so you are free to ignore them entirely.  But the process of acquiring skins does feel a little slimey.  I'd strongly prefer directly spending money on skins, instead.

If you are interested in Prismata, I would recommend buying in at the asking price on Steam, since it does give you extra single player content, but if you are unwilling to pay the asking price and can't wait for the free-to-play roll out, be aware that sometimes streamers on Twitch have keys to give to new players, and apparently there is a Discord where you can ask for a key and get one.  I've also seen the developer give keys to people asking about the game on the Prismata subreddit."

Why oh why have the devs decided to remove wild cards (doubles of the same card in the same deck) and duplicate cards (the same card in your teammates deck) in premade team battles?? Half the fun of this game was being able to strategize with a friend and come up with crazy combos, thematic decks, and sometimes just plain goofy ridiculous decks early in the league.

Overview: Minion Masters is a fast-paced, free-to-play strategy game that blends elements of tower defense and collectible card games (CCG). Developed by BetaDwarf, the game pits players in 1v1 or 2v2 battles where they summon and control minions to battle against their opponent’s forces, all while managing a deck of cards. With its unique mix of gameplay styles, Minion Masters offers an accessible but strategic experience for fans of both strategy games and card battling.

Gameplay: In Minion Masters, players build and use decks of cards to summon minions, cast spells, and build structures on the battlefield. Each card corresponds to a different type of unit, spell, or structure that players can deploy in real-time. The key to success is not just about deploying powerful units but also about managing your resources (mana), timing your plays, and reacting to your opponent’s strategy.

The game offers several different modes, including standard 1v1 and 2v2, where players can compete against other players or AI. The matches are quick, lasting around 5-10 minutes, which makes it easy to jump into a game and not get bogged down by long sessions. The action is fast-paced, with constant back-and-forth gameplay, making it exciting for those who enjoy real-time strategy with a bit of card game strategy mixed in.

Deck Building and Strategy: The strategic depth of Minion Masters comes from deck building. Players can collect new cards and customize their deck to suit their playstyle, with different minions, spells, and special abilities available to choose from. The key to winning is finding the right balance between offense and defense, while also considering synergy between the cards in your deck. There are a variety of minion types, each with strengths and weaknesses, which adds an extra layer of tactical decision-making to each match.

Progression and Monetization: As with many free-to-play games, Minion Masters includes a progression system where players can unlock new cards and cosmetics by earning rewards from matches or purchasing card packs. While the game is generally balanced and not pay-to-win, there is an option for players to spend money on card packs and other cosmetic items. This could give some players a slight advantage early on, but most progress can still be made through regular gameplay.

Graphics and Performance: Minion Masters features bright, colorful visuals with a somewhat cartoonish art style that fits the fast-paced, playful nature of the game. The minions and spells are well-designed, with each card having its own unique look and animations that help bring the battlefield to life. The game runs smoothly on most systems, and the controls are intuitive, making it accessible for both new players and strategy veterans alike.

Audio Design: The sound design in Minion Masters is solid, with an upbeat soundtrack and engaging sound effects that add to the excitement of the battles. Each card and minion has its own set of sounds, from the footsteps of marching troops to the explosive effects of spells, helping to immerse players in the game’s action. The voice lines of the minions and the announcer are charming and add some personality to the game.

Challenges: While Minion Masters is accessible, there is a learning curve when it comes to building effective decks and mastering the timing and positioning of your units. As players unlock more cards, they can start building more diverse strategies, but the game’s fast pace means you need to react quickly, which can be challenging for newcomers. The game also features matchmaking, but occasionally, you may find yourself up against opponents who have stronger cards if you're not progressing quickly enough.

Final Thoughts: Minion Masters is a fun and fast-paced strategy game that offers a unique blend of collectible card gameplay with real-time strategy. Its quick matches, deck-building mechanics, and strategic depth make it an enjoyable experience for players who enjoy both card games and strategy games. While there’s a progression system that could feel grindy at times, the game remains accessible, and its focus on skill and strategy makes it rewarding for those who stick with it.

Pros:

Fast-paced and accessible gameplay
Strong strategic depth through deck-building and unit placement
Bright, colorful visuals with appealing animations
Free-to-play with fair monetization options
Multiple game modes including 1v1 and 2v2
Cons:

Progression can feel slow at times
Pay-to-progress elements, though not pay-to-win
Some balancing issues, especially at early levels
Can become repetitive if not switching up strategies
Minion Masters is an enjoyable strategy game for those who like quick battles, tactical decision-making, and card collection. While there are some minor progression hurdles, the game offers a solid and fun experience for fans of competitive, strategic gameplay. | This game was fun for a while.

And It happened!
Great - just great at it's soothing and deeply relaxing yet perfectly paced at it's difficult march through the hell spawns :D

Now some feedback for developers;
- I played on standard difficulty for good couple of hours without dying once on rather fast route through the enemies (all 100% clear) - quite satisfying with the loot - especially how rarely better items drops - great! yet to this rather calming game I would either put some dis-balanced combat more often forcing us to retreat or push forward instead of clearing the rooms one by one. (at least in the first few hours)
- Second and last issue - in my personal opinion is the graphic - great idea for the paper figures and setting - yet after the great success I hope You will achieve quite soon - I hope for ""real"" 3D included with some stunning and eye catching visuals to back up this already great game's core. | This is a game that comes from the mind of a mobile developer. One of its selling points is the option to have a short play session—an issue that often is crucial for mobile, but hardly relevant for a PC gamer. The control scheme also feels like it was made for a touch screen. There are many mini-games that boil down to grabbing things floating on the screen. To heal poison, you have to click the bottom left with your cursor, even though normally you keep it to the center of the screen—an idea that would be handy of the game was controlled with your fingers via a mobile device, but doesn't translate well to PC.

A lot of its other elements feel clunky as well. While you can instantly teleport to the end of a dungeon when it's 100% clear, looking for that one pesky pile of gold you've missed means backtracking—excruciatngly slow backtracking. And pray that your final enemy isn't a gargoyle or a ghost: both can hide and must attack first... or ignore you, making you run past them a dozen times, groaning.

As for the presentation, I'm pretty sure that Deckard Cain voice is borderline copyright infringement. [i]Book of Demons[/i] also borrows heavily from [i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] with its combination of stylized visuals and gritty narration.

Does it all mean that the game is bad? No. It's all right. The treadmill does its job, injecting you with satisfaction via a steady stream of achievements and other small rewards. The idea of a small-budget simple Diablo-like is laudable, and you get enough fun for the price.

I do, however, feel that the 'Overwhelmingly positive' rating gives the wrong impression of [i]Book of Demons[/i] being some sort of a hidden gem.

It's not. It's just all right. | I like the concept but unfortunately the game just isn't very fun. It is extremely repetitive, which is fine if the gameplay is fun.

Las batallas se resuelven mediante tirada de dados con  modificadores en función del general al mando, terreno -que determina el frente de operaciones-, valor de ataque y defensa de las unidades -considerando su experiencia y estado de salud- y si hay o no unidades de apoyo. 

No carece de limitaciones -insignificantes en comparación con la notable calidad del título-: sin tutorial integrado remite a unos vídeos -igual que Battle Brothers- aunque presenta unos cuadros de ayuda dentro del juego; en la pantalla de inicio aparece un aviso para que adquieras la expansión o el FoG II -entiendo su razón de ser pero causa mala impresión-; el manual en inglés no incorpora los valores de los parámetros del juego sino que ofrece una orientación general -hay guías en Steam- y algún que otro detalle menor. 

Podría extenderme en sus virtudes pero intentaré abreviar: una traducción de calidad, el enorme número de edificios -¡casi 400!- con sus bonus y efectos; la amplia variedad de facciones -¡más de 70!- y unidades; la interacción entre legado, cultura, lealtad y decadencia; una IA competente; la diplomacia -que fue revisada-; el comercio automatizado de 52 mercancías distintas; es ampliamente modificable; su compromiso entre accesibilidad y profundidad, gran rejugabilidad, etc."

----------

By far my favorite of the Paradox Interactive Grand Strategy games, and certainly one of the most underrated. Vanilla post 2.0 the game is very approachable. It combines elements from Europa Universalis and Crusader Kings together. Sometimes the combination works well, othertimes it leaves something to be desired (specifically the character management). With mods, primarily Invictus, Timeline Extension and Crisis of the Third Century, you get a full experience with nearly endless replayability. For the average person, a lot of the nations in this game will be unrecognizable or even outright unknown. This does not diminish from the experience but I feel only adds the depth and understanding one gets when looking back across history. Starting date includes many historical events from the peace following the Second Samnite War, as well as an intial option for an alternate history with Seleucus I Nicator and Chandraupta Maurya, and lastly the Fourth War of the Diadochi. The modding community also supports this game in the ParadoxGameConverters, taking your save from Imperator Rome into Crusader Kings and beyond. This is easily one of my favorite games of all time. | TL;DR : One of the best of all Paradox's map games.

Amazing war mechanics, amazing governing mechanics, and hands down THE best looking map of any Paradox game. And all of that is incredibly well optimised, achieving what I believe is a nicer looking map than CK3's despite running way better. P.S. it's displayed on a sphere! 

The biggest downside to this game is that it ends too soon! If the most scathing criticism I can give your game is that I wish there was even more of it, you've made a good game. Because development was stopped after Imperator didn't sell as well as other paradox games, it feels like the ending in 27 BCE is really abrupt and unexpectedly short. As such, if you wanna play as Rome and achieve full Roman borders you'll basically never manage it before the game's reached it's end. I've played Rome in ironman mode a lot and I've never managed to even just get the full mediterranean coast, let alone full historic borders. Perhaps that's just a skill issue on my part, but still I wish you could go at least until the fall of western Rome in 476.

Please paradox, what you've created here is an absolute gem of a game, and if you came back to finish it it could be one of your best games of all time! Please extend the ""end"" date to at least the fall of Western Rome in 476 A.D.

On top of that, having additional start dates could also bring more attention and excitement to the game, and I have the perfect one in mind that nobody on the steam workshop seems to have thought of yet: The War of the First Triumvirate! 

The issue with making any start dates after the one already in-game is that Rome would be too powerful for it to be feasible to play anywhere near them, but setting the start during the War of the First Triumvirate would mean that Rome's massive 3 way civil war would leave them divided and weak enough for neighbouring powers to move in. You'd have Ceasar, Crassus and Pompey, and perhaps a united Senate all fighting for control of the Rome from their segment of its land, with many different ways it could go. (Like with the Diodachi). You'd have Egypt under Cleopatra and you could try to ally with one of the Triumvirs. Or you could play as the Parthians, Gauls, Germanics, Celts, Dacians, etc and take advantage of Rome's instability in order to nab a large piece for yourself. If I was smart enough to mod this start date into the game I'd make this myself, but alas I am not. 

Please bring more life to this already wonderful game, Paradox. It's absolutely deserving of more than it got, and I know the numbers would come back if you did. | 非常希望IR 打赢复活赛， 7500h的P社玩家表示，IR的潜力绝对被低估了，2.04版本后已经不输CK2，EU4 等的游戏性，而其可扩展的方向和内容又远超ck EU | There is very little depth to the game, whether you build buildings or not doesn't really matter, there's no real other way of improving your holdings so the game is very much conquering with none of the complexity a game like EU4 has, the politics are mainly just annoying and technology is so unimpactful they could have left it out and the game would remain the exact same."

[h3] Personal experience: [/h3]
I spent over 5 hours in the game, and I can confidently say that it’s perfect for those looking to unwind and relax. The simplicity and minimalism of the game are top-notch. At first, I was surprised by how such a simple mechanic could be so captivating. Slowly, I started building islands, exploring their potential, and genuinely enjoying the process.
The game is a perfect way to relax. There’s no pressure; you simply build, develop, and enjoy the view. I found the way ecosystems come to life and how the island transforms into a vibrant world incredibly satisfying.
[h3] Pros and cons: [/h3]
[b] Pros: [/b]
[list]
[*] Minimalist style: The visuals are light and pleasant, not overwhelming, yet still visually appealing.
[*] Easy to learn: The gameplay is simple to grasp, but it’s addictive and hard to stop playing.
[*] Calming and atmospheric: Perfect for those who want to relax and disconnect from the world.
[*] Building process: Watching your island grow and develop is a deeply immersive experience.
[/list]
[b] Cons: [/b]
[list]
[*] Limited content: The game can feel a bit repetitive over time, and while it leaves a good impression, you may crave more variety in mechanics.
[*] Lack of challenge: For those who prefer dynamic gameplay, the game might feel too laid-back and lacking in competitive elements.
[*] Short experience: Some players might find the game to be a bit too short and simple after a few hours.
[/list]
[h3] Result: [/h3]
ISLANDERS is an excellent game for those who appreciate a relaxing experience and want a break from intense projects. Despite its simplicity, it’s surprisingly addictive and allows you to create beautiful islands. If you enjoy calm gameplay and don’t mind a short but enjoyable experience, this game is definitely for you!
[b] My rating: 8/10 [/b]
[i] I recommend it to anyone who’s looking for a peaceful, laid-back experience without expecting complex mechanics. [/i] | [u][b]ISLANDERS[/b][/u] is a serene and tranquil procedurally-generated, endless, score-based puzzle game which has a city-building theme to it. Although its tagline states that it is ""A minimalist city builder,"" this is slightly misleading because the city-building aspect is moreso an aesthetic rather than a core identity of the gameplay since it doesn't involve resource or population management like the more traditional city-building games and is also less predictable due to the randomness of the maps and some of the building layouts.

Overall, I recommend the game as it is very relaxing to play casually for an hour or two here and there, while simultaneously having just enough depth to satiate score-chasers, and the procedural generation of the maps constantly challenges you to adapt to the random terrain and natural features that you are provided. Although I don't care to compete for high scores, I found that attempting to optimize my cities was unexpectedly fun and especially gratifying after planning the general layout of my city and watching the points come flooding in as my plan came to fruition.

Note: this review is current as of the unnumbered patch released on 23 November 2023 which is the latest update.

- The gameplay is very accessible to a wide range of players as it is simple and intuitive enough for casual players, yet also has enough depth to challenge score-chasers, but the game is very minimalistic and offers little to no precision when it comes to building an efficient and aesthetically-pleasing city;
- The replay value is decent and the game is fun when played occasionally in shorter sessions but the core gameplay loop will get repetitive very quickly;
- The graphics are vibrant, almost cartoonish, and are reminiscent of the ""Chibi"" art style;
- The soundtrack is composed of relaxing ambient music with rural-style sound effects to give the feeling of an authentic city; and
- There is no story whatsoever but a casual puzzle game like this doesn't have a need for one.

The game has 38 achievements, most of which will be acquired throughout casual gameplay while a few will require you to go out of your way to set them up but aren't difficult by any means and should take less than 10 hours to achieve; however, the [i]Conqueror[/i] achievement will take at least 30 hours by itself and require you to become very familiar with the mechanics of the game while also planning the general layout of each map before placing any buildings. That being said, it isn't nearly as RNG-dependent as many complaints on the Steam Discussion forums would lead you to believe as you merely have to invest some time into the game to learn it beyond a casual level since the achievement is not a given whatsoever.

[hr][/hr]
[quote][b]R E V I E W[/b][/quote]

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
The gameplay is more akin to a puzzle game rather than a traditional city builder because of its focus on simplicity and minimalism: a map is procedurally-generated, you are given a choice between two random sets of buildings, and your inventory is populated with a number of buildings from the chosen set. Your goal is to place the buildings efficiently in order to receive point bonuses from other types of buildings and meet the point threshold which gives you another choice between two more random sets of buildings. This process repeats itself until you either fail to meet the point threshold, by having no more buildings to place, or meet the threshold which allows you to travel to the next map and restart the gameplay loop, ad infinitum.

As far as casual play is concerned, the game is simple and intuitive enough to get into and occasionally have fun with in small spurts. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for those who like to chase high scores because the game demands absolute precision when placing buildings and planning out your city but offers you very few tools to facilitate this need and the tools that do exist are quite shoddy. For example, there is somewhat of an integrated ""snap-to"" ability but it is finnicky and rarely lines up buildings perfectly with one another which can lead to inefficiencies and cause you to lose points -- and sometimes those few points could be the difference between losing a run altogether or proceeding to the next map.

Sometime between 2019 and 2022, the game was handed over to an entirely new development team and they added the more difficult achievements which require a certain level of precision that the game simply can't offer and this makes the minimalist approach of the game feel almost incongruous with, and somewhat inadequate for, these new achievements (one of which is the infamous [i]Conqueror[/i] achievement). If they had made the existing snapping more accurate, added an option to turn on a grid, or gave you a laser level tool, then the game would be feel much more precise but you can definitely tell the difference between the two development teams' philosophy on achievements.

Another minor gripe that I have with the overly-minimalist approach is that the House, Mansion, and Park buildings also have a variety of different layouts (similar to Tetris blocks) but the next one is randomly chosen for you and can't be changed which is irritating from an efficiency perspective and true city-building aspect but I can't complain too much about it because it fits the minimalist design approach that they were going for.

Nevertheless, I still found it quite fun to learn the more intricate nuances to the game's mechanics and optimize my cities; however, once I figured out the most efficient setup then the most fun part became the planning of the city and playing the actual game for long periods of time became a bit of a chore which is why I think that it's a good game to occasionally have fun with in smaller doses because it gets repetitive very quickly.

The game also has a Sandbox Mode where you can unleash your creative side  with an unlimited supply of all buildings and a Photo Mode where you can take fancy images of said creations using a variety of built-in filters and tools.

[h3]Graphics[/h3]
The graphics are vibrant and almost cartoonish in nature which gives it a very charming look. The buildings are also blocky but in a cute and bubbly sort of way -- if anything, I'd say that its art style actually resembles the popular ""Chibi"" art style because of how cute, minimalistic, and caricature-like the art design is. The second development team also added a number of optional seasonal and holiday themes that you can apply to your game to spruce things up at your whim which is a nice touch.

[h3]Sound[/h3]
The soundtrack is made up of relaxing ambient music with scenic noises such as dogs barking, birds chirping, and other rural sound effects. The music is so modest that I'm not even sure if the audio tracks would count as ""songs"". Much like the graphics, there are a number of optional seasonal and holiday-themed songs that you can enable or disable but I frankly couldn't even tell the difference between any of the songs. All-in-all, it's just a very relaxing soundtrack which I would say resembles white noise to some degree. The sound effects are few and far between but the main one you will hear is placing a building which makes a very satisfying plopping sound.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]
Overall, I recommend the game because you can easily relax to it for an hour and forget about the stressors of life as you get immersed in its soothing audio, charming visuals, and straightforward and leisurely nature. If you're more of a score-chaser then it's surprisingly fun and engaging to plan out your city, optimize the placement of your buildings, and get that feeling of elation as your plan flourishes and you watch your points soar. | ISLANDERS is a beautifully minimalist city-building game that’s perfect for relaxing and flexing your creativity. The simple mechanics focus on strategic placement of buildings, offering a satisfying mix of puzzle and strategy elements. The colorful, procedurally generated islands are gorgeous, and each new map feels like a fresh canvas for your ideas.

While the game doesn’t offer endless depth or complexity, its simplicity is part of its charm. It’s great for short sessions or unwinding after a long day. For its price, it’s an excellent indie gem and a must-play for fans of chill city builders. | Маленькая, но приятная и медитативная. Функционал не большой. Тем не менее хочется возвращаться и играть вновь и вновь! | Fun at first, but gets repetitive extremely quick. There's really only a few ""Valid""arrangements that let you maximise score.

The devs are only adding more and more content, each improving to the game and adding more challenges. | I had to uninstall this game. I don't even play city builders! Why am I putting so much time and energy into this game!?

If you want a time sync play this game. It's a delightful way to spend your time and it's pretty low stakes. Just make sure you follow the tutorial steps early because I've found the most likely point for your colony to die is very early. Once it's up and running you might screw it up and kill off half your beavers but it's kinda difficult to kill off so many that the colony entirely collapses.

Oh, and prioritize simple foods and water above all other jobs. So long as your colonists have those they survive. They might not be happy but grumpy and alive is better than dead.

Anyway, play it. Good game. 8/10. Now I'm going to uninstall it before I lose another two working weeks of my life to it. | After nearly 20 hours of playing in the last few days, I think it's safe to say I like this game.

Not because it's a colony sim. I've played my fair share of citybuilders and logistics management games and, while Timberborn does a perfectly competent job at that, it isn't what makes the game truly special (at least not for me).

Because what do beavers do? They build dams. So what would super-intelligent beavers in a post-apocalyptic future do? Why, they'd build massive water engineering projects, of course.

That, for me, is the main selling point of the game and what really sets it apart from similar colony builders: your survival depends on managing water, which means building dams and floodgates and levees and sluices  to direct and control its flow. You use water to keep your farmland irrigated, keep your drinking tanks filled, and to power your industry. Water is your lifeblood, it is your everything - so manage it well.

Oh - and just to check, you've got an alternate flow solution for the upcoming Badtide, right? Don't get *too* comfortable just cuz you got your irrigation sorted out.

Timberborn lives on its beautiful modelling of water flow, so much so that it made me read up on fluid dynamics to really understand the nitty gritty of how water speed, volume and pressure all interact with each other. If you want to play a game that indirectly teaches you how Bernoulli's principle works, get Timberborn.

76561197999259031,1102190,Monster Train,92.15,Strategy,28,"Monster Train is a deck-building game. It's following in the footsteps of other great games like Slay the Spire. As a result, I will be comparing this game to Slay the Spire a lot.

In Monster Train, you defend a train full of (you guessed it) monsters. You fight a series of battles, with each battle involving a bunch of minor enemies followed by a major (boss) enemy. In-between battles you do some deck construction using various stations. One run takes about 60 to 90 minutes.

I've gotten 85 hours of fun out of this game.

THE GOOD:
- Monster Train is a really fun card battler.
- The train level mechanic, where you have 4 different levels in your train, adds a lot of strategic depth and novelty.
- You can always refuse a new card or artifact, something I always wished I could do in Slay the Spire—which would force me to take cards I didn't want and then make it really hard to get rid of them.
- It's also easier to remove cards you don't want, often allowing you to craft the deck you want by the endgame.
- The game lets you know who the major bosses are at the very start of the run. This allows you to build your deck accordingly.
- Great variety of enemies, cards, and special abilities.
- Great learning curve, as new concepts are gradually introduced so you don't have to drink from a firehose of knowledge.
- Nice graphics and music.

THE BAD:
- There is no real story to the game. There's kind of the veneer of a story, but it doesn't really explain why you need to do multiple runs.
- Even with the better control over your deck than other games in the genre, you are still at the mercy of the random number generator. It can be frustrating to lose because you never found the cards you needed, or because of a terrible draw for an otherwise great deck.
- The game developers claim this game is a roguelike, but it's not really. You play to unlock new features, which is a good tutorial mechanic, but to be a roguelike the game should require you to learn by failing. I won on my second attempt.

THE UGLY:
- In this game the protagonists are the demons of Hell, and you actually fight against Heavenly angels. This doesn't bother me, but you might find it offensive.
- When using a mouse and dragging a card to play it, if you linger the game can automatically scroll up to a level above. This is a great way to ruin your battle by playing the card on the wrong level!
- The game enables you to ramp up the difficulty with a feature called the Covenant. This is ostensibly a good thing that gives the game some extra life and challenge. Unfortunately, in trying to find a variety of ways to increase the difficulty the game designer has mainly made the game more annoying. They add lots of junk cards to your deck and make it harder to remove those cards. Hence, rather than ending with a bang, the game kind of fizzled out with a whimper as I got increasingly frustrated and quit.
 | I'll be honest. I didn't like it that much. Primarily because the game at higher difficults devolves into gigagbuffing one monster to solo the final boss. Still though learning the game was great. | I played this roguelite cards battler on various platforms, gamepass pc ,xbox and steam, and its a great game. Fun. 
For me the progression of the game is really good, while you play more you unlock fun other stuff. The combinations are a blast, you can make over the top OP cards. I like the sounds when the train is totaly full and your cards all packed with buffs, the sound is not beautiful, but catching, and I like the raw sound of the abilities clashing into each other.
Its cool and easy to play some rounds, make comobs and have fun.
Game is fun and well made, for sure worth your time

 | I stand by my early impressions that the UI clashes terribly in this game. For context, I've played and love Slay the Spire, and I THOUGHT I'd like Monster Train, but I thought it was kind of ugly...I admit I wasn't in the mood to give it a fair shake, and it is now starting to click with me. It's good, but not great, with tremendous replay value. | High Quality Time Deleting Machine. I have hundreds of hours on mobile as well.

Just can't anymore.
When Bungie actually puts in effort into their game (Aka, major DLC's minus lightfall) the game is amazing, but the amount of times they have dropped the ball, especially with this last episode/season has finally done it for me. I've followed Destiny since the original on the xbox 360, became a fan of the story, and continued on into Destiny 2 back when they were still part of activision on battlenet. I've always attempted to keep good faith and put in a good word even when the game was at a low point, but now after having the saint-14 and osiris gay love story interjected and shoved down my throat multiple times, the last season ""echos"" big bad guy get one shot in a cutscene and escape by floating down a vex ""milk"" river, and now the current episode which started by reusing a game mode that they butchered and made worse than the original which was still in the game and the other gamemode that came later which was decent but had loot that you could get just by running around in the standard maps made it not at all worth doing. Compound that with the tonic system that relied on Strict RNG to get new tonics which were necessary to get further in the reputation system and played a minimal part in the over arching story and took forever just to get three tonics out of DOZENS WHICH BARELY WORKED AND WAS ON A TIMER THAT YOU HAD TO MICRO MANAGE ON TOP OF OTHER MICRO MANAGING SYSTEMS.... yeah it was just TOO MUCH.  The final nail in the coffin was the fact that we found out just how much work they put into the seasonal / episodic content which normally is spread out when they gave it all at one time. By the way you could do all 3 parts of revenant in less than 3 hours which for something that you pay for is absolutely Pathetic. For comparison Warframe Is completely 100% FREE and has proven to have a better player experience, impactful story, developers that actually care, better visuals, smaller file size, did not take paid content away forever (yes that happened in destiny), and more. 

I loved this game because it's story at one point was amazing and now... it's a chore.  Combine all that with the current state of the company's choices and behaviors, it's just not worth trying to keep the rose tinted glasses on and support it anymore.  I loved this game.... and I just feel betrayed and disappointed.  Call me a Schill, say I'm coping, or a hater I no longer care. Like many said Destiny was the only thing that could Kill Destiny, and well they did it.  I'm done supporting Bungie until they get their collective heads out of their ass.

Edit as to Toasty's comments, I don't care if Osiris and Saint are gay, I care that the fact that they are gay is more of a Slap to the face and is way too frequent as a main story beat, it's not subtle like other characters and kept in the background as an aspect of the character which would have made the first Episode much more impactful story wise. As Toasty mentioned Warframe has these notions and explores it but it's subtle and not in  your face and distracting from the overall story which is why I exemplify it's story over This one. Take that as you will but I stand with my choice and opinion, don't be assholes just because you disagree and have a different opinion.

For those who didn't fixate on being jerks trying to demonize another person,

Pete Parsons is directly responsible for cutting hundreds of devs and bringing this ship crashing into the ground. Destiny is genuinely unenjoyable and within the hour i was bored. this is genuinely depressing as i have thousands of hours, and thousands on psn and have loved the game through some of its lowest points. but the mediocrity of this season is killing me. i genuinely am worried this game will actually die for real within this act. | I think this is the best game ever made and it's not very close. I started playing around the time it went free to play and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. No other game does what this one does. I think everyone should get to experience what Destiny offers. This rating is positive because of what this game has meant to me, not because of what it has become.

	[*]This game is so unfairly priced that I can't genuinely recommend any of my non-Destiny friends or new players to pick it up to try it out.
	[*]The community is toxic as hell.
	[*]The game is dying, fewer and fewer people get on to play every single day.
	[*]There are cheaters in 1/3 of Crucible games (might just be caused by the dwindling player count making the concentration of cheaters higher).
	[*]Every new update is bugged (sometimes to the point of unplayability) and results in either server downtime, another update to address it (takes a month for this to get released), or Bungie just giving up and auto-completing quest steps.
	[*]The new player onboarding experience is abysmal. You're given a 5 minute cutscene to explain the story (since they completely removed the real campaign), a couple of introductory quests, and then you're kicked out of the bird's nest to do whatever your heart desires with minimal direction or suggestion on where to go. So bad, in fact, that Bungie has given up and now provides players with an option to skip it entirely since they know that if a new player is playing this game, it MUST be at the direction of another existing player telling them what to do anyway.
	[*]The game is riddled with power creep. Guardian kits are the strongest they have ever been and new aspirational content has gotten easier and easier.
[/list]

Realistically, the game needs a reset like Destiny 1 got with the release of Destiny 2, but Bungie's insistence on this being a forever game post-Final Shape has led to Destiny 3 being nothing but a pipe dream while this game wanes in its final days after the equivalent of an Avenger: Endgame story beat. Bungie just doesn't know when to let it go.

The case study that prompted me to write this review:
I'm playing a greedy game where I'm the only civ on my relatively large continent. I pick England and build Strongholds in various strategic locations. I own the whole continent and have lots of tech and buildings but a fairly small army - just enough to strongly defend a single attack point. I begin building ships to explore the world. I finally encounter another civ, then another. The world congress begins almost immediately. One of the civs demands 2000 gold from me. I naturally refuse. They push the issue to congress. I don't have an embassy yet, so I can't do anything about that, but fine. They won't be able to break into my continent. They pillage one of my two harbors. This gives them enough warscore to enforce peace, get the 2000 gold plus another 2400 gold for war reparations. I'm in bankruptcy. I work my way out of it. They demand 2000 gold again and now I can't refuse because my people don't want war.
What is the gameplay here? Pillaging a single district is enough to instantly end a war and enforce demands strong enough to cripple the enemy until you can immediately send more demands and declare war again? The war didn't even last long enough for me to attempt to fight it. I wouldn't mind if they enforced demands after they had landed a force and begun sieging my cities or thoroughly pillaged my entire coastline, but it was one single district. Honestly most games seem to end with one stupid mistake or lucky break, which is already not that fun, but you throw mechanics like that in and it just isn't worth trying anymore. | 慎玩。解决了文明系列的大部分问题，参考了文明系列的0项优点。 | I love this game.

(My Civ VI score: 5/10)

* WONDER MECHANICS
Simply wonderful!
One of the best features of Humankind is the two steps mechanics to CLAIM and then BUILD World Wonders. It also allows the Wonder to be built by the whole empire, as a Shared Project, which makes perfect sense. I cannot praise this enough!
I've been playing Civilization since the very first version, back in 1991, and the most frustrating thing about Civ was always the Wonder building system. In Civ, its ALL or NOTHING.
Amplitude Studios did their homework well and came up with a new system, which is fair and realistic.
For ""builder"" players like myself this feature alone makes Humankind worth buying and playing. :-)

* COMBAT
The combat mechanics is simply great! They mix the advantages of manual strategy with automatic strategy in three ways: Fully automatic, semi-automatic and fully manual modes. What else could you ask for?
Besides that, combat takes into consideration the height of the battle ground and the AI is actually very good in tactical combat. They often surprise me with their deployment.
This strategic combat type was never implemented in any Civ-like game that I know of, but it makes the battle more realistic and much more strategic. I never liked combat that much in Civ, but I was excited to try this system to the full in Humankind and I quite like it. 

Another good thing is that your units are able to retreat from an unwanted battle or one with a possible defeat. Even this was done in a realistic and pondered way, because you cannot do it two times in a row with the same unit and you must have accessible terrain where your unit may go to run away. Again, this makes perfect sense and is well balanced.


* 6 ERAS AND 6 CULTURES
Being able to choose a different culture with a new set of skills and abilities, makes perfect sense and mimics how humans actually evolved through the ages.
Everybody that played Civilization had to stand before a ridiculous situation of facing an old civ (e.g. Ancient Egypt, Grece, Rome, Aztec) with the modernized Americans or Germans.
This huge change in mechanics is an historical achievement in this type of games.
My congratulations go to Amplitude Studios. The proof that this was (and is) the way to go, is that the developers of CIV VII already made it their main feature. ;-)


* START OF GAME IN A PRE-ERA: The Neolithic
The way we start the game is perfect! That is exactly how it should be done.
In civilization you can choose a place to start but most of the times you have to choose a tile in the first turn, without knowing anything around. That may be disastrous in the long term and was one the major reasons why I quit many games of civilization after having spent a few hours and played for 60 to 100 turns. All because your very first city was not on the best spot, OR because you lost 2 turns finding the best spot, you would then lose the ability to build important and critical Wonders, which would ultimately kill your long term strategy.

This no longer happens with Humankind. Since you start as a group of wanderers (as in real life hunter gatherers) you can start raising population with food from wild animals and at the same time search the surroundings for the best spots for your home capital city.

RELOCATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE CENTRE OF TERRITORIES
Apart from this, there is also a huge and meaningful option: before creating a city you need to claim a territory. The main tile of that territory, around which food and production will be gathered, may be changed as many times as you need, before it is evolved into a city, or simply attached into an existing one.
Again, this avoids many frustrations and is a lot more realistic, because that's exactly how things happen in real life.

DISTRICTS AND INFRASTRUCTURES
In Humankind a District is basically a building than you use to increase the yield of certain resources, such as Food or Industry (Production in Civ).
It makes a lot more sense than the awful idea that designers of Civ VI had, which made me dislike a Civ version for the first time ever!

* CITY LIMITS
Territories and Outposts make the evolution of cities much more interesting, flexible and realistic.
The City Cap limit that is implemented in the game allows players to create only a certain number of cities without an Influence penalty. 


* WAR UNITS
Each military unit consumes Population to be raised, which again makes perfect sense since it's how it happens in real life.
It also forces the player to think strategically when going to war and raising armies because you must have population, not just units.

* FAME POINTS
Although points had always been in Civilization, they were calculated in obscure ways that I never truly understood, since v1, and you could only know them at the end of the game, so they never influenced the gameplay at all, being just a kind of side effect of your gameplay.

THINGS THAT NEED IMPROVEMENT
* The AI is very poor in almost all situations, except in tactical combat, where it is very good.
Most Civs seem not to have a specific goal and strategy for how to win the game and so it's very easy to beat them after learning how to play the game.

* The graphics in the game are good, but the 3D Avatars are simply awful and should be improved.

* You have to pick 6 cultures in a game, so if you play with 10 civs (like I usually do) there should be at least 60 cultures available, and preferably a lot more than that, but there aren't.
I end up using only one or two different cultures, in each era, most of the times I played, because there are not many different options to go the same path.

UNBALANCED WONDERS
Some are too powerful (e.g. Machu Picchu) but most are too weak or are of little use for most game strategies.
Besides the cost to claim them raises exponentially, and it is almost impossible to build more than 10 Wonders in a single game, which is a shame.
I think there should be more Wonders with different effects and more balanced.

* DIPLOMACY (on DLC)
Most of the Diplomatic features are only useful to the loosing players. So, unless you are a beginner being beaten by the AI, those traits will not benefit you at all, but instead will benefit your opponents, which makes little sense to me.
Besides that, the Diplomat stars (only in expansion) are extremely difficult to get in large quantities like it is usually required in every Age.
Diplomacy in general is weakly implemented and needs a huge rework. Civilization is a lot better than Humankind in that regard.

CONCLUSION
Humankind was pioneer in many regards, and that brought difficulties for civ players, like myself. But after understanding the game, I have no doubt that it is much better than any previous Civilization version. And the proof of it, is that Civilization VII, which is just about to be released, implemented almost all of the major new mechanics that Humankind created.
So my congrats go to Amplitude Studios. Please don't quit Humankind, because I'm still going to keep playing it. Please launch more Culture Packs and do a rework of the Diplomacy."

This game gets significantly more fun the more you view it as a puzzle game rather than a city planning game. You are not trying to build a nice place to live. Instead, you are trying to funnel the right cars to the right places in whatever way works best. This leads you into some city designs which would make absolutely no sense in a normal city builder, but looking at it as a puzzle game, this is not a problem whatsoever. To be clear: there is no goal in the game other than to make roads for the cars to reach the right color of business. The cars will always go the fastest route, and always deploy from the nearest available house, so you don't need to do any management at all other than setting up the roads and trying to plan it so that there isn't gridlock. This simple task never gets boring for long because the demand for cars will ramp up to inifinity until you lose. You can play ""endless"" mode once you lose, but trying to get the most trips completed before that point is the real draw, like trying to get the highest score or level in Tetris. | Schönes Spiel zum entspannen, ich mag die Grafik sehr.  Viele Maps und Möglichkeiten, wird nicht so schnell langweilig. Kann ich nur weiterempfehlen :) | Игра, в которой получаешь кайф просто от наблюдения за машинками. А потом ты думаешь, а почему бы не попробовать выбить все достижения и..... Ну в целом это реально, я почти все выбил, осталось всякие еженедельные и ежедневные активности закрыть и достижения по числу использований определенных улучшений, но мне стало впадлу это делать. В остальном игра топ, баланс конечно иногда может кинуть подлянку, когда появляются не те цвета где ты их ждешь или неожиданно квадрат в круг превращается. Но в классическом режиме можно все удалять и менять, там проблем особо нет(только ЕБАНН**ЫЙ МУМБАЙ, я на нем для 2000 поездок перепроходил раза 4, причем каждый раз результат был все ближе и ближе к желаемому результату, перед успехом получилось на 1996 закрыть, чуть не сгорел). Могу дать совет трофихантерам - на некоторых картах 2000 проще выбить через челенджи чем через классику. Полезность улучшений зависит от карты, иногда лучше взять светофор или круг, нежели шоссе или мост. Но это вы уже на своем опыте сможете узнать. 
В общем игра топ, и для отдыха подойдет и подумать и погореть, выбивая ачивки, можно. Я очень доволен покупкой, мне больше понравилась эта игра, чем про метро, она более честная в плане сложности. | ---{ Graphics }---

If you like strategy, city building, and management, this game has you covered. I think about this game the way I once thought about Total War games and Civilization. Games should be designed for the players by people who love to play games. Not corporate goons looking to finance their third homes.

This is a gamers game. | In my first two years of ownership, I would have said this is easily the greatest city builder ever created. But in its current state and seemingly the direction it’s headed, I cannot recommend this game. 

In the beginning, this game would have been comparable to rimworld or dwarf fortress. It was a great world/story generator that allowed you to play at your pace. Want to rp as a small fishing village? Do it. Want to rp as a giant empire with 9k residents and over 20 regions in your control? Do it. 

Currently, the game now would be more comparable to factorio, in that it’s really only about min/maxing now. Instead of creating a world the player is free to make choices in, the game now forces you to rush and progress in the way the dev wants you to. 

My current gripes with the game: 

- Maintenance: when this concept was originally introduced, I saw the vision. It’s an interesting mechanic that would make sense in a city builder. However, the dev has genuinely #### this mechanic up SO bad it can destroy a run easily. They have decided that most buildings need a constant stream of building resources to be repaired (even at 100% efficiency). This now bottlenecks EVERYTHING, bc to build a new building you need to increase every industry that creates those resources, but now you need more people, but now you need more food, but now you need more people to work the farms… but wait… now you need more people to increase productivity of other products or your citizens will rebel and leave… but wait… and thus you’re in a never ending race between “oh my god my people hate me bc they are starving” to “oh my god my people hate me bc they don’t have furniture”. 

- Technology: 

I genuinely have no words to accurately put how much I hate the technology overhaul. The newest updates has made technology an Unintuitive micromanagement nightmare. It’s clunky, makes zero sense, and another element that now will randomly bring a run to screeching halt. BRING BACK THE OLD SYSTEMS. 

- Upgrades: 
Upgrades have consistently gotten pricier with each update, as well as making some of the upgrades less efficient. This does not add “challenge” to the game, it just removes the significance/feeling like the player can actually make any choices. At this point, you are forced to build in the order the “game” wants you to. The pricier upgrades, mixed with bs maintenance, and now a ruined technology system give the perfect storm for a cluster #### of bottlenecks and other logistical issues. Except unlike factorio, in this game a bottleneck for two minutes could end your run bc citizens have revolted and left. 

- Dev vision: 
It is seemingly apparent the dev has changed the identity of this game and what he wants it to be. That’s fine, I mean he IS the dev and it IS his game. Recently on the discord, he has mentioned that he wants this to be a game where players MUST utilize excel sheets, notebooks, and min/maxing. Yeah no, I’m out. I work in finance and stare at excel sheets all day, I want to play a video game to relax and have fun, NOT work 2.0. IMO, there is an extremely loud minority on the discord that has “highjacked” this game from the actual player base. 

In the end, the game I bought has become tedious and moved away from being a fun, organic city builder to more of a math problem with animated values. I will likely still play the game (as you will probably see my play time go up), but only versions from 2022 and lower. | This is by far the best indie game and city builder i have ever played. Its the only game that I have ever experienced that brings grand strategy to the city state type of era. The game is in a fantasy world which made me apprehensive but is beautifully executed and you can tell was handcrafted with care. After a few hours of play i started to adore all aspects of the syx universe and quite enjoy the setting now. TRY THIS GAME! Don't just buy it and let it gather virtual dust after trying it and quitting due to incoprhensive intimidation. Play this game. | Great game, very deep, continuously challenging and highly addictive. So simple yet so complex.
and theres nothing quite like the feeling of watching 300 slaves pour into your prisons after sacking a settlement. lol | Very good game. Lots of depth and complexity to get through. Biggest problem IMO is the game is both incomplete and a little buggy. 

There's a lot of complexity in how the game works and it feels a bit like a sandbox game. For example, there are multiple races and some do not interact well with others. A workaround is creating districts in your city and separating housing and workloads to keep both happy with minimal interactions. 

One issue I had was I was trying to figure out why trading wasn't working. Turns out that the trade price listed isn't real time so I needed to decrease the price so the other territory would buy it. But the game doesn't show this so you get stuck wondering why your trades aren't going through.

The game has some incomplete features that get looked at between updates. But updates are slow due to the small development team (I believe still a single person)."

That said, it's also boss gated, which might be a turn off unless that's your jam. | Necesse is THAT game for me. A game that I love coming back to again and again, a game that i love to continue playing even after the story is completed, a game that i want to write lovesongs about. a game that is just absolutely perfect.

I bought necesse on a whim after seeing a youtuber play it and i instantly knew that i would love it. I am a huge sucker for colony sims to begin with, i love building and grinding and exploring. While the start of the game is pretty slow, it picks up a lot after you've recriuted the first villager and defeated the first boss(es). 

My first playthrough was with a very early version and i already loved every second of the game then. A huge update kinda messed up my character and i stopped playing for a while before i started another run. And what can i tell you- the game has grown so much in those few months and it continues to get updated. You can do soso much in this game, it's amazing! visting other islands, building and decorating, managing your villagers, recruiting new villagers. fishing, mining, dungeons, boss fights, crafting new weapons. It took me 70 hours to do one run (defeat all the bosses) but i did spend a ton of time building my base. I am still not done with my island and could put another 50+ hours into my current game.

I cannot put into words how much i love every second with this game and how much i hope that more people play it to see how awesome it is! The devs deserve so much praise for this absolutely devine piece of work!

Also, this is only version 0.29. I am excited beyond words to see how HUGE this game will be once it's finished <3 | On its surface it looks like rimworld with rpg elements. When you get into it, you find there's just no real depth. 

For as open world and procedurally generated it is, the game is intensely linear. Go to an area, get the next tier of material/gear/crafting, kill the boss. Next time, the enemy may shoot blue instead of green at you but it's essentially the same thing with slightly higher numbers and a color palette shift. 

There are no real choices in character or town building.  Build the next thing, get the next gear piece, and everything goes along smoothly. 

It's still early access so things may change, but it's not quite ready to dip your toe into yet. | Necesse is a great game. Yes, it does remind a bit of Terraria but that's imo a good thing. Necesse is in version 0.30 as we speak, so it's far from being finished, and there isn't as much content as in Terraria for example. However if you're not focused on 100%ing the game I think you can still manage to get like 40-50 hours of playtime out of it, so you're definitely getting your money's worth.

It's enjoyable both with friends or solo. I like that you can change your difficulty on your current world simply by going to settings: you don't have to start a whole new world just because you want a more chill or a more difficult experience on a given day. The graphics are nice too. I also like how you don't really have to worry about food once you got enough settlers, as a lot of them will help out on the farm.

Overall I really enjoyed the game, and it definitely has a lot of potential, so I'm curious to see how the future updates will add to or change the world.

The best single player experience I've had in a long time | 论剧情，整体是基于希腊神话而改编的作品，得益于希腊神话故事的错综复杂与有趣，使得整个游戏剧情上的人物便有许多对话可写，扎格列欧斯与神明的互动到众神之间的互动，几乎每一把都有新的对话产生。与之相伴的还有好感度，随着好感度上升解锁信物和越加亲密的对话。能与希腊神明近距离互动，着实是一个有趣的体验。本人最喜阿尔忒秘斯的形象，一是喜爱其所代表的领域，狩猎与自然，二是形象上，恩，这是个人喜好。
在背景故事上可以岔开来说一件事，就是希腊神话与人间秩序的关系，这也是我打游戏时候一直所想的。在神话设定中，神明都有所统治的领域，如战争之于阿瑞斯，爱情之于Aphrodite，狩猎之于Artemis，死亡之于hades等。神明是与人间的秩序所息息相关的，Hades在游戏中所重复的一句话，若凡人不害怕死亡，则还畏惧什么（大意应该是这样），由此也作为自己在地府中所操劳的理由。故不仅仅把希腊神话作为神明之间的故事来看，而是构建人间的秩序来看希腊神话，应该发现很多关于故事新的寓意所在，比如Orpheus欲带妻子从地府归来，其最终是以失败的告终，原因在于其因为其好奇违背了契约，若从构建秩序的来看，其寓意何在？对于契约的遵守？还是死亡的绝对性。其神话中各个英雄的故事，其应代表了一个文明所倡导的人格导向，那么英雄的悲剧，比如赫拉克勒斯的杀妻与十二试炼，这指向的什么？以上这是神话的内部构造的导向。其次是从神话与人间的互动来看，最典型的是以神明起誓，在游戏中是以hades之名，来获取神明的祝福。在现实中，这种习惯也是存在于希腊文明之中，其所发的誓言是以人的行为和神明所代表领域所相关的，如苏格拉底便常常以宙斯起誓，其欲带表之后的话的坚定或真实等。这种以神明来起誓的行为正是神话与人间秩序的互动所在，参见到中国，亦有“举头三尺有神明”，“天知地知”。这种构造可能是早期文明维持秩序的关键所在。我很好奇这种习惯是如何最初被构造出来并且传播。
论美术，这美术很好，特别是神明的立绘，是我一开始玩这个游戏的原因。要说怎么好吧，这一点说不来，我对于鉴赏艺术并不在行，只是符合自己顺眼的感觉，好听一点的话，就是这艺术与人内在目的的相互契合。
论机制，这个游戏的正反馈机制设计的很好，拉着我连续沉迷了三天，我根据我的自身体验来谈为何这个容易上瘾。首先是rogue机制，作为基底的武器种类与神明赐福的组合来带来不同的感觉，由此来刺激你去组合出各自不同的组合，我比较喜欢的是武器是罗摩弓和磁力拳套，赐福是Artemis的追踪箭搭配赫尔墨斯的快速攻击，刷刷刷地就清屏了。其次是人物，这游戏的文本量相对丰富，主要是体现在人物的对话上，几乎每一局游戏，你都可以与游戏人物展开新的对话，这个在rogue游戏里可不多见。且人物可能因为你的行为而产生出颇为有趣的对话，比如Hades会吐槽你在神殿的各种装修，在与神明对抗中选择使用神明的赐福，赠予蜜露以及美酒后产生的良性反馈。这一点促使我进行了后两天的游戏。不过比较难受的一点就是对话的随机性，导致一些解锁好感度对话需要很久才会出现，比如解锁好感度限度的对话，不少人物的好感度解锁对话真是难寻，以及解锁武器的新形态也是如此，我现在还没刷出chaos关于盾的对话，md好感度都满了。最后能够提供正反馈的就是各种收集和肝的系统，信物的等级，称号的等级，这些我是肝不动了。 | Best, most well rounded game i have ever played.

This game doesn't feel right. 
Judging by the trailers and genre it self-identifies as a horde survival game, with the implication you'll endlessly be struggling against a swarming blob that pushes against your walls and defences.
Unfortunately, it's more like a mad rush for min-maxxing resources before a wave spawns and marches at you. In the earlier levels, this means the wave is extremely small and underwhelming. 90% of the time you are not in combat and are being secretly fought against by the clock of economy efficency.
The game doesn't seem to know what it wants to identify as. Some units want you to micromanage abilities and boosts like a Total War game, but in other ways it feels like it wants you to fire and forget troops into big blobs that fight the enemy. The pathfinding makes combat pretty nasty, too. The enemies walk in a straight line towards something, not flank or try to outsmart defences etc. So in terms of tower defence it is also pretty bland. In fact one of the metas is to actually entirely ignore the tower-building aspect of the game and just build a huge mass of infantry blobs to swamp and enemy unit that gets close to you.

The difficulty is also obscene. The game is challenging on even the baby difficulty and ruins the potential the game would have for a chill version where you simply treat the game like a city builder.

The game isn 't awful, but it doesn't really have any holding power. Big fights are done better elsewhere, city building is done better elsewhere, RTS style resource mad-dashes are done better elsewhere. The artstyle is pretty decent but the story/cutscenes drag pretty badly. I'm not sure this game can defend its existence against They Are Billions or even genre-adjacent games like Total War, Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator, or city builders like Manor Lords. | ---{ Graphics }---

 | 与其说是塔防，不是说是RTS。资源少，特别是地形小+开局投奔市民少，不能开局趁前2波敌人拉跨贪一波直接爆经济，周围战争迷雾中遇到的野怪敌人是固定科技等级，也就是说如果你想开局探地图的话就可能拉到一群三本大兵直接拆家，不探地图开局经济有限也不能把操作投入运营，甚至因为无法探地图+地形小连精打细算摆位置都没有意义，只能苦等天亮刷市民，刷出来了又在几十秒内全部用完继续等第二天。就如同文明你拉个探索者出去遇到了Xcom的野蛮人，直接灭国。

Please fix it! | I do not gravitate to automation and factory games due to generally the levels of complexity, the moving parts and the sheer amount of things you have to do in them to get a working, self sufficient, well optimised factory. While I thought Shapez would be the same kind of thing, I was delightfully surprised that after playing a handful of hours - Shapez gives you the bare bones of ""Hey, here's a hub - put shapes in it"". It isn't pretty, there is light and dark mode! 

What I really like about Shapez was the fact that although it clearly states ""This is not an idle game"", I can play it as slow or as fast as I want. Nothing is going to implode if I don't get 5,000 squares in the hub within a 10 minute window with the slowest belt making me start ALL OVER AGAIN. The only thing that happens is that it just takes more time. There's no pressure to need to get good at the game really, really quick or suffer. You as a player can do really whatever you want. Make the most complex, well optimised, efficient factory and find joy in that. Or be like me - take one thing at a time (generally) until you get the hang of it and then just run with it. 

This was a great introductory game to start me off in a genre of game that I generally steered clear of. 
I am very glad I got good at Shapez before really diving into Shapez 2. It gave me a solid start in understanding the beautiful upgrades Shapez 2 got and made me appreciate the growth from Shapez 1 to Shapez 2.

This game is good. Not great. Not Fantastic. Not bold or new or genre-defining.
It's a 'good' game that's gotten worse since being bought by Paradox for one poignant reason:
Their pricing is outrageous. Saying this is a $20 game is a stretch but I'll bite;
But the DLCs are not worth $5 per hero and $10/$20 for 'campaign expansions'.
There is a good reason why purchases are low and reviews are mixed for those items.
Paradox is gross for trying to monetize this game like Stellaris. | I don't recommend playing this game.

It is too fun. It is too addictive and every battle is pure novelty. It's endlessly playable and I just dropped 150+ in like....a month into this game.

The plus is that it's more stable and much less taxing on system resources than Banished, which makes it easier to play on a lower spec system.  
The minus is that the supply chain system is almost comically simplified.  Consider the Gathering hut.  When placing the building, you can see how efficient the building will be based on where you place it, which is great.  Once you place the building, that value is locked in - even if you cut down the forest all around that gathering hut, it will still produce goods at the same rate and quantity because the worker magically produces the goods in the building - they don't actually need to gather anything.  This applies to every single resource building except the Forester hut, which actually has to cut down trees.  
Additionally, the fact that all the warehouse buildings are linked through some temporal rift makes things simpler but significantly less realistic.  There's much less management you need to do, which may seem like a good thing, but also makes the game less fun for people who actually want to manage their cities.  
As an aside, one of my pet peeves about this game is the fact that workers won't get their own resources from the supply depots.  They can be right next door to a depot, and just sit on their thumbs until a worker runs all the way across the map to get something from the depot for them.  
While this is a good game in that it works well, and has plenty of research and upgrades you can do, ultimately I'm disappointed by how simplistic it ended up being. | Very nice combination of Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom and anno series. Very addicting. | El juego no esta mal, Pero el dev lo dejo re tirado.   Por 20 euros es un robo. Por 8 bueno... pooco contenido. | Want a more dynamic city builder?  Here you go!

 当方、
Warhammer はSteam専科｡
SF寄り40k世界は Gladius心酔｡
独自色強めファンタジー版AoS世界は、本作が実質初めてです。

そもそも Warhammer Age of Sigmar （AoS）に興味を持った自分は､同じ世界で少数ユニットの本作を､取っ掛かりとして入手しました。


■ ゲーム概略 ■

AaoSファンタジー世界のターン制ストラテジー｡1ユニットは戦士/怪物1体。戦場としてはかなり小規模。

3〜7ユニットで構成された『ウォーバンド』1部隊を自軍とし指揮｡ヘクス(六角マス）マップ上で戦闘。

キャンペーンなどはなし（！）
任意orランダム選択の敵1隊と戦うのみです。


■カード要素■

20枚程度のデッキ2種を予め準備します。
走攻守に使える「策略カード」デッキと、地点占領や自軍生存等の「目的カード」デッキです。


■戦場■

マップは、自軍敵軍が数種類から選択し､方向や占領対象などをプレイ毎に選択(ランダムお任せ有）

そんなコンポーネントの組み合わせが､、思いのほか多彩な戦況を作ってくれます。


■自軍/敵軍ユニット■

『ウォーバンド』はユニット構成等が固定で、変更は出来ません。

しかしながら、本作の現行は「ウォーバンド14種全部入り」バージョンン。

正義の神軍、山賊団から怪物の群れ等、多彩に14種類あり、それぞれのデッキカードは調整可能｡遊びごたえ有りな軍勢です。

※以前のver は個々の？ウォーバンドが別売りだったみたい…個々のキャンペーンもない……


■ゲームモード■

ゲームモードは､ウォーバンド1vs1の戦いが基本。vs CPU戦orフレンド戦がメイン。

※ 野良マッチは、ほぼ全滅集落です。

※ キャンペーンモードは、まったくありません。どの勢力にもありません（繰り返しますが、以前は別売りだった、ウォーバンドにも、ありません）

■ ゲーム進行 ■

「互いの各ユニットを交互に行動させる」
を、3セット終了時点の勝利ポイントで競います。

※ 行動の合間に、バフ・デバフ等のランダム配布される自デッキの策略カードを多用する感じです。

■ 目標カード ■

勝利ポイントは、敵ユニットの撃破や、自デッキからランダム配布される（敵には非公開）目標カードの条件達成で加算します。

目標は大きく分けて「特定拠点の占領」と「特定敵の殲滅」になります。

事前の策略/目標デッキ構成で、いずれかに注力するか、バランスを取るかが戦略の要点になります。

総じて、1プレイ30分弱｡
サイコロ運もかなりあるので、カジュアルに楽しんでいます。

UIのもどかしさと、カード一覧欲しいネは気になるトコロ。

それ以外は､限定的環境で精鋭が切削する、緊張感も適度な好ゲームてます。

――――
■ いくつかの疑問点■

残念なのは、『作品世界』や『各部隊/キャラの氏素性』などのフレーバー情報が、ゲーム内にほぼ皆無な点。

※ 含・キャンペーン皆無

主対象層であろう英語圏プレイヤーなら､軽くググれば原典ミニチュアゲームの情報が山ほどありますけどね。いまは機械翻訳も優れているし。

ただ､そもそも【シグマー世界の入門色もある原典ミニチュアゲーム】である『Warhammer Underworlds』の､【より手を出しやすい電子版】である本作に、ナラティブなフレーバーが皆無なのは、かなり疑問です。

※原典マニュアルには多くの世界解説があるようです。

また､各ウォーバンドのユニット=各戦士/猛獣/亜人/怪物等々は固定であり､それぞれ個々に名前も背景設定もあります。

この辺も、本ゲームではオミットというのは、ニワカ未満のファン予備軍としては、非常に残念でした。
※ 英語検索と機械翻訳に頼って自習しました。


■余録・ユニット概説■

興味を持たれた方に、自分がググったウォーバンドの、不完全情報を追記します。

ウォーバンドの和名は、原典ゲームの日本語版製品の和名。

他は英文wiki等の抄訳です。「秩序」等は部隊が所属する勢力のアライアンス(勢力の大枠）。4pなら4ユニット編成の意味です。

76561197999259031,1741640,Shadows of Forbidden Gods,9.083333333333334,"Simulation, Strategy",7,"What a unique game! Very immersive and actually has very rich mechanics that interact with each other, creating cool emergent gameplay as you influence characters in the world and then watch how they turn against each other and the world slowly descends into chaos | It's good.

There are not a lot of games that focus on indirect control as the core mechanic, and SoFG is probably the best one out of all of them. All the things you'd expect to be wrong with a game of this scope to budget ratio are there, from crunky UI to unevenly available information to arcane sub-sub-subsystems that might decide the outcome of your game if you haven't seen them before, to very uneven feel of quality between different playable elder gods...

But then if you're looking at this title, chances are at least some of the opacity, abundant complexity and plentiful soft failure states are actually a draw rather than a drawback for you.

The game has a number of subsystems that interact with each other. Plagues cause death, death can be used to spawn ghasts, which will enshadow the countryside, enshadowed locations corrupt their rulers and heroes with more shadow, at which point they will start ignoring the spreading plague.

However, the game is also full of heroes and rulers who will by default fairly easily undo anything you put into place. The key to winning the game is often two-fold - picking a core strategy early (which means learning enough about what they all are, which will take a while), and running distraction tactics until your core strategy completes.

You have a number of agents and evil god powers that are all able to make the world a little bit worse, but none of them will be enough to win the game on their own. Instead, the game essentially is about building out a self-growing engine of corruption and decay into the game world's independent systems.

Assassinate a ruler? A heir will take his place. Instead, steal a personal belonging of theirs and use it to engineer a scandal in a neighbouring kingdom, making war between them that much more likely.

Drive a local town into madness? The clerics and heroes will soon fix it. Instead, mask and hide the growing abyssal fish-people cult until it begins spilling over into new towns and you can curse entire family bloodlines.

Amass an orcish army and break the human kingdoms into dust? There's more of them and they will destroy you armies once they become notorious enough. Unless of course you have a secondary orcish horde ready to take over the now-abandoned lands of their slain brethren - and those of the razed human kingdoms, too.

Try to remove a ward against shadow a religious movement placed? They will place hundreds more. Instead, manipulate signs of prophecy to place your own minion as their prophet, and slowly turn the religion into one that spreads shadow for you instead.

The game has a stupid amount of options and eventually it makes it really fun to engage with the game, being able to pick from your vast array of tools to sculpt just the outcome you want. Until that happens, you're kind of stuck picking things up to try them out and learning that hey actually they don't do very much on their own at all, and that the process for finding out why they failed or what they even do is pretty obtuse. But, you know. Some days all that feels like a plus. Maybe today's that day for you? | This is a very good strategy game - buy it.  It  could use some better tutorials and the UI is wacky.  However, once  you get a grip on how the game play works, it is a lot of fun to watch the good folk crumble to your long simmering plans.  Also, each of the  evil gods play very differently and this offers a lot of replay.  One thing that could use improvement is the magic /special actions systems where it is way too time consuming to mess with compared to just enshadowing. everything  (with the possible exception of death magic ghosts).  Anyway, this is is worth full price. | This is the roughest game I have ever enjoyed.

As people have warned, the UI is terrible. It does slow the game down, raise the learning curve, and make figuring things out a chore. The nicest thing I can say about how the game looks is that it manages to not clash too much, despite being somewhat cobbled together from limited art-assets and public domain-images. 

But as a grand-strategy game, the game still manages to work, and deliver on it's theme. If you bite down, there is much, much here to chew on, and the planning and strategizing of your moves is very rewarding. The writing and aesthetics could be better, but the game delivers just enough lore and fluff with it's mechanics, for most of the themes to land. 

Everything around the core gameplay in this game could use some work, but what's here is a functional, strong idea in a genre that rarely gets good games. | Если вашей душе захотелось чего-то более нестандартного в плане пошаговых стратегий, то как-то раз я наткнулся на... это.

Прежде отмечу что да, графика тут по сравнению с прочими коллегами по жанру полное днище, даже по весьма непритязательным меркам. Но, мы же в инди не за этим идём, правильно?

А игре есть что предложить, потому что... В двух словах её геймплей уже успели довольно ёмко охарактеризовать в другом обзоре: ""Представьте, что вы играете за Ктулху, в то время как остальной мир вокруг вас играет в Crusaders Kings""

И это действительно так. Только играете вы скорее не за самого Великого Древнего, а за условную группу его приспешников, которые пытаются своего покровителя призвать в дженериковый фэнтезийный мир с людьми, гномами, эльфами и прочими орками.

Начинаете вы одиноким сектантом в капюшоне, который должен пробраться в ближайшую деревеньку и начать там распространять веру в своего темного повелителя. А делать это нужно затем, чтобы потом было проще разносить свой фхтанг уже дальше - в города и столицы королевств, постепенно становясь все более заметным и могущественным. При этом вы медленно распространяете порчу, которая называется здесь ""тенями"" (shadows), нанимаете новых агентов, творите различную магию... Ну а мир вокруг вас до поры до времени просто живёт: кто-то на кого-то нападает, соседи заключают и нарушают договоры, герои - геройствуют.

К слову о последних. Вы же не думаете, что они вас будут все время игнорировать? Рано или поздно ваши козни станут слишком заметны на мировом фоне и здешний Избранный начнет как в заправской RPG собирать под свои знамёна армии и убеждать правителей в том что вы не просто наркоман, балующийся зельями, а опасный культист, стремящийся захватить мир.

Но произойдет это не сразу, потому что, как я уже говорил, пока вам нужно наращивать свою мощь, в том числе за счёт новых агентов. А они бывают двух категорий: стандартные и, скажем так, уникальные. Из первых можно лепить что вам вздумается, а вот вторые обычно имеют собственные портреты и уникальные навыки, недоступные прочим. Тут все как на подбор: падший аристократ, дикарь, безумный шаман племени орков... двенадцать колоритных личностей. Ну и вместо полноценной графики у них тут портреты с закосом под эпоху Возрождения. А ещё вы можете совратить одного из уже существующих героев, чтобы он встал на вашу сторону. Ну или банально свести с ума - одной проблемой меньше, так или иначе.

Всех агентов можно отправлять на различные задания, которые включают в себя как обычную инфильтрацию в сообщество крестьян Малой Кукевки, так и более сложные вещи наподобие изучения магии, исследования вон тех древних руин или сражений с войсками ""нормисов"".

Да, тут есть простенькая боевая система, напоминающая весьма упрощенные Discilples: по ходу игры вы можете нанимать для своих агентов различных бойцов, которые будут защищать их как от назойливых приключенцев, так и солдат местного лорда, которому вы чем-то не угодили. Особых тактических изысков не ждите, игра всё-таки не про это.

А вот кому угождать нужно, так это вашему темному божеству, поскольку нужно успеть захватить мир до того как истечет определенное количество ходов. Ну а ваш покровитель, в свою очередь, предоставляет вам свои, зачастую уникальные способы по достижению своей цели. Непосредственная помощь, как правило, представлена в виде различных заклинаний, которые вы можете использовать на общей карте. Причем, чем больше вы распространяете порчу и чем больше проходит времени, тем сильнее становится божество и под конец его аватар даже может самолично выйти против зарвавшихся смертных.

Впрочем, на вашу долю тоже выпадают определенные события, которые представлены в виде простеньких текстовых квестов. Хоть они и часто повторяются, но вносят свою небольшую лепту в разнообразие геймплея.

И вот таким образом вы постоянно отправляете кого-то на задания, сражаетесь с врагами, изучаете новое заклинание, что приводит к небезызвестному синдрому ""ещё одного хода"", когда оторваться до самого конца партии ну очень сложно.

Ну а для тех, кому захочется добавки существует целое DLC ""The Horrors Beneath"" которое вводит целый дополнительный слой карты - Подземье и связанный с ним контент, включая новое божество, дремлющее в недрах планеты. Впрочем и восьми Древних в оригинальной версии хватит надолго. А ещё игра официально поддерживает моды и там тоже можно найти что-то себе под стать.

Однако, к сожалению, не каждый сможет продраться сквозь перегруженный интерфейс и малоинформативное обучение. Да и перевода у игры тоже нет, к сожалению. Но если у вас получится пройти сквозь все дебри, то поздравляю - вы сможете вдоволь порадовать внутреннего злодея."

One game takes ~ half an hour and there are a good amount of maps + starting positions with ranging difficulties. | I think while it’s a good game it’s not for me and that’s why I have to leave this review. It’s so zoomed out, that it’s really just a math and spatial puzzle. The theme really doesn’t come through much at all. It’s all about optimizing your position on the board but there’s no asymmetry or theme beyond what terrain a space is. 

Just not in depth or thematic enough to hold my interest for more than the 12 hours I put in. 

I do wish the developer luck in their next project though, because there are some good ideas here. | Love it, definitely recommend the game. Especially if its on sale.

What makes the game so good is its simplicity as in ""easy to learn, hard to master"". You will not be bothered with 500 different mechanics like in Civilization but if you want to, you can still make it challenging. I also like that you can finish a round in one sitting. And even if you don't, you can come back to a game later and won't need long to figure out where you left things.

The DLC does not add new mechanics, so you do not need to buy the complete edition but can start with the base game. | There is nothing wrong with a game being basic, but then the gameplay that exists has to be stellar. I don't think the gameplay in this game is good enough for a recommendation, although it's not terrible either. In my longest game I was waiting for random troop boost cards, turn after turn, to give me enough +strength to do anything. | Incredibly fun 4x game that usually takes about an hour or so for an entire campaign.  Strategy is engaging and lots of different maps and civilizations to explore."

Nothing about it sounded fun. But then I watched a video of someone playing it on YouTube and thought it looked much more fun than the promotional videos had shown. So I gave it a try and OMG, I totally enjoyed this game. It has no right to be as fun as it is. I tend to be a completionist and this game helped scratch that itch. The best part is that I'm a huge fan of Castlevania so that DLC was just the greatest thing I never knew I needed. Seriously, for me the Castlevania DLC made the game at least 10x more fun.

My only complaint would be it's kind of a one and done for me. Once everything is collected I don't feel a need to play it. Loved playing it that first time around though, collecting all the things, unlocking all the stuff, it was fantastic. I'd have to do a complete fresh install to relock everything to make unlocking it again enjoyable. But still, it was the best 190+ hours of my recent gaming life :D | This game has the best ratio between the amount of fun you'll have with the fewest amount of buttons. I've never played anything this deep with literally just WSAD and Space. Also, 5€ full price for this? What a bargain. I get that it's a simple game, but come on. Give yourselves some credit, devs. And thanks for the full ultrawide support, although I would prefer a third option to solid and transparent black bars, which would be no black bars, but that's a massive nitpick.

EDIT: Ooooooh! That's how they make money! They have DLCs, so the whole game is actually 20€ if you want everything. That makes way more sense. Still too cheap though, because from what I've tried from the DLCs so far, they are very good and definitely worth the asking price. | A lot of people like it but I honestly found it kind of boring. Just wander around automatically shooting stuff until you get overwhelmed, then repeat. It's fine but wasn't my kind of game. | Literalmente el juego del vicio a su máximo esplendor, el trailer habla por si solo, vas a dejar tu vida jugando a este juego para conseguir todos los desbloqueables y probar todas las combinaciones o personajes posibles.

El contenido que obtienes de juego por lo que pagas es totalmente justo, ya poseo todos los DLC hasta la fecha y realmente cada uno suma una cantidad de contenido absurdo que da para aun mas horas de juego.

Además, como fan de la saga Castlevania es muy divertido ir notando cada una de las referencias que guarda este juego y cuando añadieron el DLC de Castlevania, literalmente explote.
 | good mindless one hander to keep your adhd satisfied while you watch stuff, i also love how the Bible is the most powerful weapon in the game, like in real life, the enemies are charming and silly, the effects are incredible at higher levels, also love how the reaper comes in and gets you in the end everytime and theres nothing you can do about it, this is like a 2D cod zombies, i love games that just keep getting harder till it becomes impossible, no sense of accomplishment, just a straight waste of time, endless"

aunched  and it was AMAZING with tons of players and hype....

then you took it down and killed ALL of the momentum and popularity then RE-released it with TONS of micro-transactions and bs grindy features no one wanted. you could have just released the game AS IS and added more characters and maps and had a success. now? we get to lose all the potential this game had and no one who spent money on anything is getting refunded? i have MORE tokens for free characters than u even released....like tf?

and then instead of at least keeping it up so we can play youre shutting EVERYTHING down? WB..stop making games....just license them to someone who isnt a greedy r#t@rd and ACTUALLY cares about the properties involved.....after this i refuse to EVER buy any game made by them or give money to WB again. so sick of them killing games less than a YEAR after its official release....



please someone steal the code or something so we can at least keepo this game going via p2p or fan servers.  or maybe someone buy it form them and release it as an ACTUAL finished game instead of locking everything behind TONS of grind and paywall | This game was peak when it first came out and was probably the most fun I've had in gaming in a long time. But after being shut down for a year and coming back to this, it just makes me sick. This game really isn't fun if you play it for rank like me you will destroy your mental because this game is still broken after that year gap. Even with the new changes in combat this game is just not it, very ass backwards dev. I'm not sure what can be done for this game very sad to see where its at now after loving the beta. I've spend $100 on the founders edition for the game I once loved, now this game is just a joke. | This plays like molasses. I can't believe I spent 100 bucks on the Founder's Edition for the game I was supporting in beta to be nothing like the game that's shutting down later. F Warner Bros. | Can't say I'm surprised the game's shutting down but the abruptness and way it's being handled sucks. I strongly recommend reading the most recent announcement but tl;dr they've disabled purchasing gleamium and people that have the game are required to log in between Feb 4th and May 30th to be able to play the game offline as afterwards they will be disabling online and taking the game off stores. I feel like this is going too far too soon. They should keep the game on stores and available for everyone even if it is just offline at the very least.

My friends and I enjoyed Multiversus back in the closed alpha + open beta and I unfortunately bought a founder's pack thinking the game would last and continue to be enjoyable. They all stopped playing after the changes made to the full release but I came back to play a bit when they started adding more Cartoon Network characters like Jack, PPG, and Marceline. Despite owning every character in the game I have a lot of spare currency from that pack such as character tickets that I'll never be able to use. There has been no word about any kind of compensation. Something as simple as being able to exchange unused currency for gleamium would be nice. There are some cosmetics that I would've liked to purchase and have after the game shuts down.

It's a shame the game failed. I feel like there was potential but changing the gameplay and upping the grind for getting characters did irreversible damage to the game's reputation. Reception in my friend group went from positive to ""I'm never touching this game again."" There was also a bit of confusion when the game was taken offline after the open beta as it felt like it had already released with 2 seasons of content.

I'd like to see another Warner Bros. crossover game someday. Hopefully it won't turn out as bad as this one did. | The Warner Bros. greed took over, now its shutting down after season 5. Added cool characters WAY to late

if only they listened to the players and actually cared, this game had potential.

I want to love the game but it feels like I'm in the back seat of a car, to be exact ""It feels like in the back seat of the back seat of a car"". I am at the trunk of a car heading straight to a cliff, and i am tasked to ask the second row seats to help navigate the drivers where to go, meanwhile keeping them entertained and prevent other people from other cars to convince our people from killing each other. while a priest keeps yelling ""shame shame shame"" at your face right next to you
-RANT-
visitors are the worst their people spends more time in my land than their own and you cant close your borders they only come to spread rumors or seduce your women if they arent monogamous if you ask them to leave their faction will hate you even tho they a crime against your people. the more you are friendly to them the more they are a pain in the ass and come to your land (let me close the border ffs or let me chose to let them in or not. they come in like an annoying aunt/uncle that thinks she has the right to sleep in one of my open rooms then slander me, try to bribe my gardener to stab me and seduce the married couple like its a normal sunday morning cause they needed to let off some steam for 3 rings)

priest and church arent that better basically sends a useless freeloader that you constantly need your ruler to socialize so that you can leave your children on them to teach.  Im not sure if my guy is the king or that guy cause I need to baby him more, they basically dont do anything its better to have one of my VERY LIMITED/BARELY CONTROLABLE/EASILY BRIBED  people to constantly preach and be a priest. you cant even opt out of the church and have normal traders 

I cant wait for mods for this - the only thing that could save this game(no steam workshop yet date of this rant)
""I want a different map where the final enemy is not the church with different mechanics"" maybe make it a BBEG/barbarians from the north/a powerful necromancer that sometimes sends waves in my base from time to time while uniting other kingdoms that hate me(as a main mechanic not the event already in game replacing the church mechanic)(let me equip my people with a bow or mace or at least i dont know how to equip them properly) or have the kingdom tax/southern merchants guild/angry mage require tax once a week if not I get attacked/assasins try to kill me/ a natural disaster from a mages tower. or have us explore the new world with the church mechanics but we get imports from the mainland or something till we get establish I dont know... im ranting basically because all i know my neighbors are annoying pain in the asses whitout cooldown while the church only looks at me and judges my actions | Start the game on normal mode, die. Make the game easier, die. Make the game EVEN easier, die. Look up strategies, implement strategies, but loose track of your resource management briefly, Die.

It does however fall short on replayability, updates and gameplay mechanics. Recent updates has only brought flavour with no real core gameplay mechanic that brings players back for a new playthroughs. 
The replay value is quite low as the map is quite small and only has some selected areas with their own maps, more variaty and auto generated maps should be added and prioritized, rather then adding ""guests"" updates. 
The potential of the game is the character build up and how they interact, but they need more scenes / areas to explore, a lot of current features feels like placeholders which no functionality. 
Villages for instance has no real interaction with the players, just bonuses on resources.

Vous n’êtes qu'un simple employer, dont l’âme ne vous appartient déjà plus. | Heretics Fork is an interesting title, but I won't classify it as the generic roguelike deckbuilder;

You are drawn cards in every X seconds intervals and the time stops while you have your cards at hand, you have mana and you build or upgrade stuff (which will be always located in the middle of the screen) and wait until it's the time for the next draw interval. The game starts out as a roguelike deckbuilder, it has it's difficulty but it's neat, both the visual and audio design in the game are pretty decent, so Heretics Fork does a good job with most of the things it's doing, except for;

End-game.
Unfortunately I cannot say the same for the late game, it's still subjective but for my sake, I would like to keep the game the way it was, in the same genre, but it fleshes out to something different the more you progress in it's meta-progression:
Basically this game has a lot of card unlocks, and in the end it allows you to equip so many different kind of winning styles, except for; ""rng""
Sadly this doesn't pair well in Heretics Fork, because you are limited by only a few choices of card rewards in your entire pool, and mixed with you having way too many different card possibilities which sadly do not synergy with another, you are mostly left to the fate, essentially turning this into a casino roll, the fun and the creative aspect of the game dies with it and it becomes a ""side-screen"" game where you check and click based on the randomness time to time, and the most-time being spent on the ""waiting"" until next draw makes it even worse since your experience is no longer favored ""as much"" as it used to be, thanks to the crazy amount of unlocked card pool.

The game offers a lot of challenges, again, they are easier to do on low level and very difficult (rng, not actual difficulty) on late game.

It's still not a bad game per se since fun is subjective at it's best, but I wish it stayed the way it started out as, so do be warned before picking it up | Playing on Steam Deck.

Fun game but two times it randomly crashed mid run with no save and there are some key mechanics that are just broken on Steam Deck like combining towers as mentioned here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/2181610/discussions/0/4512128989222080840/ | 核心玩法确实很一般，构筑和局外养成几乎不存在。

Halls of Torment has a very befitting name and for sure it reaches it's point of illogical endless progession too but they have found ways to make the gameplay, on the 1000x repeating maps, quite interesting.

On top of that add some Items, some of them are mandatory for specific builds but yet there's alot of freedom to experiment around because they managed to keep most of them very useful.

That alone already sold me for most of the time I enjoyed the game. 

If one goes further they have added a cute endless mode. Cute because I personally love endless modes but this one didn't hit me as hard as some other games. You can pay gold to get random debuffs on your next endless run. Which I think can be alot of fun but I enjoyed their ""Artifacts"" far more.

You can play the basic maps with a mutator but the good thing here is you can decide which ones and how many you take, though each artifact will buff enemies base-stats no matter which artifact you pick. (...and yourself by granting more xp.)

That is in which I have lost myself, enjoying this game just the last few weeks.

If you manage to debuff the hell out of your run and kill the bosses in the end you get a currency to endlessly upgrade your characters. 

Now the kicker: In other games you have 100 of the progression upgrade-thingies.
You apply it to one character. 
Now you have 0 upgrade-thingies. Here you can upgrade them all simultaneously.

Fcking broke my mind.

First I resetted all the stats before applying it to a different character, because I was so used to games robbing your time and making you upgrade all characters each on their own.

But in HoT even characters you ""don't like"" will become viable only by playing your favorite character.


Halls of Torment. A big YES!

Enjoy the suffering! | Dieses Spiel ist umgekehrte abzocke

Viel zu viel Inhalt und Spaß für zu wenig Geld! | BUG不修内容不做就改你那平衡性，怎么这么多肉鸽游戏开发者都这个毛病 | Fun at first, but gets old pretty quickly.  The end game revolves around running standard levels with negative modifiers, in hopes of getting better gear and cash to use on the final dungeon.  The problem is that the negative modifiers really turn the game into a slog, and the final dungeon is pretty mediocre.  I do enjoy the core loop and the various skills, but I have no desire to play the same missions, but with reduced visibility, or invincible enemies, or lava constantly spawning on me, etc.  It's not a knock to the developers; they have designed the game they want.  Sadly, it's just not for me. | I have mixed feelings on this one. On one hand, it is only 6,66€, looks good and runs well. On the other hand, that is all it has going for it, yet it still sits at 95% positive reviews. This rating seems too far from what I think it deserves, so I want to shine some light on its weak points to help out those who got blinded by the visuals (you know who you are).

tl;dr: Game has no performance issues and looks like Diablo (which is 95% of its merit). Gameplay is unengaging and grindy and peaks at ""not harsh anymore"". Not good, far from fun, just ""not as bad as it was starting out"". 
If you REALLY need your survivor-like to look like Diablo, then go for it. Otherwise go for Holocure or Death Must Die (or Vampire Survivors) as they all outclass it in every aspect aside from maybe your personal preference in visual style.

Be warned that a long, rambling yap is following.
The game starts slow, as in ""your character moves at a snail pace and barely clears the enemies"" slow. Matches the visual style and the unforgiving gameplay of the era that its visuals draw from, but that's about as far as the compromise goes. Maps have a few different point of interests you can reach, but due to the movement speed you likely won't get to complete more than one set of them at a time during your first runs, if at all. Combat feels adequate, with some desperately needed stat increases on level up to make your first character not fall behind too far and maybe survive 10-15 minutes on your first try.
Go back to the camp and spend a few coins on meta upgrades to your stats. Rinse and repeat a few times until you get enough stats to have your character not feel crippled, but instead appropriate to have a chance at clearing the level. Repeat for 10 hours until you realize that the grind never stops and you have yet to reach the point where you feel strong instead of handicapped, and the game did not hit actual fun territory once during your playtime.

Sounds overly dramatic, but that is what my experience with the game was like. 
It is understandable for your power level to be too low for a chance to clear the first map on your first tries, but here it feels sadistic. You move slowly, barely get to pickup resources due to your tiny pickup range, and attack slowly. Once enemies start to come in at a faster pace it won't take long to die. It takes a few runs to grind enough stats to have enough power to clear, and even more if you want to get some QOL stats, such as movement speed and pickup range, just for gameplay to be less [i] tedious [/i]. The first map and its accompanying missions provide enough motivation and rewards to offer a quick increase in power level, but all that does is unveil the plethora of other systems the game has been graciously saving so you don't get swamped with too many grinds at once.
One at a time you get to unlock (and grind to upgrade) meta progression such as: more stats to upgrade, reroll and banish options on level up, items to equip, and also new classes. Just for those you will need to run maps plenty of times, not only do you collect currencies, the equipment you want to unlock only reaches your camp if you collect them during a run and then send it back, one at a time, during the level to save it, and thus have access to it in future runs. You need to sacrifice power during any given run in favor of meta progression since you lose a well needed upgrade to unlock it permanently. On its own that sounds fine, but it is so slow. You only get to do that for one item per run (at first? Could be upgradable, but who cares to play enough to find out), and with the amount and variety you want to build up for the roster of heroes, that is gonna take a LOT of runs you play just to collect items and send them back. And then do it again, but this time purposely pick an item that does not fit your class, but hasn't been unlocked. And then again. And there is no other option, such as playing well and getting to carry out all the items you carry. Only the one item you send back to camp, everything else collected is lost.

Is that bad? So bad that I would go out of my way to write a negative review?
No, but it's one of the more egregious systems that require running maps over and over. The real bad part is that running maps is not fun. The core gameplay that the meta systems loop you around is slow and unrewarding, and that is the actual sin.
I started out talking about the game feeling slow, which is due to the default movement speed, along with attack speed and no access to advanced skills. This gets better after all, since your gold goes into rectifying that. But then you complete dozens of runs and find out that the game is a different kind of slow aside from the meta grind: Actually clearing maps is an uninteractive waiting around until the time ticks down. Once you hit the desired power level to comfortably grind meta items, you get to enjoy not being threatened by mobs anymore. That is where you find out that leveling up is presenting you with a screen showing multiple rewards to pick from, yet there is no real decision to be made. It might have felt like it during the first map when every stat was lacking, and you had to assess which area was lacking most at any given moment, but later on those stat increases become less impactful. The real meat should be in the advanced skills you get to upgrade every few levels, yet there is not enough variety among their upgrade paths, or interactions between skills to force any actual decision making. Skills are just a different visual that enemies die to. No matter which one I committed to, the gameplay felt the same. The way you move and engage with enemies does not change depending on what you picked. It is easy to see the clear best option, and then it is back to waiting for another 5 level ups to pick another one. There is no crafting a build in this game, no theory crafting synergies, there is only choosing which skill you want to carry you through a level, and then investing in it once unlocked. 
And once you do, it doesn't even get fun. Even with a strong loadout and great items, you might be strong and delete enemies, yet not even this state is actually fun to be at. Enemies come at you too slow to make it satisfactory, so even the ideal endgame power level is just...not fun. After all the grinding to get past the painful early stats, and the grinding to unlock enough meta systems, and enough grind to earn meta currencies, you go into a run, auto pilot your ""build"", and the reward is watching enemies not kill you. You don't explode the screen, no shredding hordes of mobs that threatened you before. No happy brain chemicals. The game goes from ""you feel slow and weak"" to ""you are not slow and not weak anymore"". The best it gets is not being painful. Gameplay peaks at ""not bad"" instead of good, let alone actually fun. This is the real death sentence.

Torturous beginning that flows into a steady stream of meta systems that require grinding their currencies. A slog of repeating maps and doing runs that do not require actual decision making, and do not offer the depth to allow theory crafting build. All of that just to make a character reach a power level where you do not die, and do not even get any real satisfaction of looking at waves get annihilated, but instead just trickle in through the border of your screen before dying. A roster of characters that play too similar and not engage or synergize with skills either, so no real depth here either. Pick whoever has the best stats, and by the time you hit level 10 in the level, it's all the same.

This game encourages you to grind a boring repetition of levels and refuses to acknowledge good gameplay with meta rewards or even the basic satisfaction of ""build goes brrrrrr"". Painfully tedious at the beginning, slightly less tedious by the time you realize that is all it has, and drop it for a better game. But at least it looks like Diablo from 1997, right?"

I'm a bit worried the combat will get repetitive, but as a free game, it's definitely worth a try if it looks appealing to you.

The game is sort of an MMO in that you can see others walking around towns, but you only bring people into fights with you if you choose to.  Given the equipment, skill tree, companions and abilities, it looks like there are a lot of possible builds to play around with as well.

You can only have 3 people (including yourself) on a team in a fight, so keep that in mind. | I see it like a Side game and not a main one, so I think this is a good one with a lot of things to farm

What I liked:

-PVE is great, it feels rewarding in higher tiers and helps you escalate in lower ones
-Melee combat is fantastic, it feels fluid and has enough fexibility during the first stages

What they must improve:

-Advanced PVP combat is broken, once you get to understand how stats, abilities, and passives work, it turns into a skill-spawn fiesta, or a hack-n-slash-button-smasher brawl combat which favors whoever has the highest stats (mostly vampirism), leaving almost no room for tactics or skill to shine. | I think its a really good game, so is dark and darker. | 垃圾 | Meh | 1"
76561197999259031,249050,Dungeon of the ENDLESS™,0.0,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",0,"I came back to this game after not playing for many years because of fond memories of the unique mechanics and the strategy.  I cant think of another game quite like this. 

I really enjoyed the problem solving, and scenario planning aspect of the game.  It is a ton of fun to play, once you figure it out, and this is where this game falls down, in guiding new players.  

I would highly recommend new players to not shun character guides and other online resources to get going.  This is a ten year old game and I think they purposefully designed the game around ""discovery"" mechanics (especially around character skill progression and item effects) so you learn by doing,  Which I think would be fine if you unlocked something that documented the information for you so if you step away for a few weeks you don't forget.  I find myself wasting resources to ""find out"" what something does only to have forgotten even later in the play through. 

Personally I think if this game underwent a UX/UI cleanup, slightly better tutorialization of some of the mechanics and better information persistance you could re-release this game today and it would attract a huge following. | Addictive, good looking, funny, rogue type game that makes you utilize brain and try it in different play modes.

9/10

Cons - sometimes it is too dependent on random elements. | Simply one of my favorite games of all time. DoTE is a fun little tower defense that can be played solo or with a group (up to four players.) There is quite a few characters to unlock with their own unique play styles and abilities. The difficulty levels are a bit of satire “easy” is quite damn hard, it’s extremely challenging to finish the dungeon. Where as “too easy” is well, just that after you get the hang of things, still a fairly good challenge starting out and later on with the different launch pods you unlock after successful playthroughs. FIDS resources are the same as other endless games. If you enjoy resource management and tower defense you should love this. | Не цікава, не весела, цілком порожня гра із високим порогом входження. Не рекомендую нікому. 2/10 (повернув би гроші, якби міг) | It's a good rogue-like style dungeon game, great to play with friends."
76561197999259031,2511500,Dominions 6 - Rise of the Pantokrator,126.61666666666666,Strategy,0,"You got three ages to choose from, each with their own flavor:

Early Ages; magic is abundant, high fantasy, low tech.
- Want to play as the Holy Roman Empire as Christianity was settling itself after Jesus's sacrifice? And attempt to revive him in game?
- Want to play as japanese Onis led by a hungry hungry Koi Fish? Or perhaps an old man? Or a bleeding fountain?
- Want to enslave everyone's minds as R'lyeh led by Aboleths?

Middle Ages; magic is starting to go away, but it's till very much there, ""normal"" technology (plate armor and such is starting to be worn)
- Remember the Holy Roman Empire? Well turns out something went wrong trying to bring Jesus back and everyone died and became an undead. Fulfill your Lich kingdom fantasies with MA Ermor!
- Want to play as Monkeymen that banished their evil demon overlords as they search for enlightenment?
- R'lyeh now has Squid People leading them, the Aboleths are missing. Their slavery practices remain the same.

Late Ages; magic is scarce, technology is at the all time high (full plate and crossbows are more common)
- There once was a race of cave-dwelling cyclops, in the Early Ages they released things that they really shouldn't (you can recreate that event in game!), in the Middle Ages, human refugees started joining their dying race, in the Late Ages, these cyclops are long gone but their human followers learned how to reanimate them and their golems, who they venerate  as divine beings.
- You can play as a fantasy version of China, with Dragon Emperors and everything!
- R'lyeh now spreads madness, even amongst their populace, the Aboleths are coming back... and they're not happy.

And oh boy, what you can do in these games...
- Let's start with the underground Cyclops, Agartha, Pale Ones. They don't need to eat and they're cold-blooded. You can turn off the sun so your enemies starve, or alternatively make another one and watch as crops burn, and your enemies struggle for survival as your giant army sweeps them while they're weakened.
- The Onis can increase unrest in a global scale, and they gain power from unrest
- Underwater factions can opt to freeze the oceans so nobody can enter their dominion, while they freely teleport their armies on dry land (as long as they're amphibious and not aquatic)

Your -pretender- god empowers Holy units by just existing. And oyu can customize it too.
- What if your holy mages or priests never got tired of casting spells and blessings?
- What if your holy cavalry had regeneration? And flaming weapons?
- You got a lot of Holy giant mosnters in your roster... and they're terrifying (literally)... wouldn't it be insane if to attack them every unit ahd to pass a morale test or be unable to strike them?

But wait, there's more! There's a lot of detail put into this!:
- Any unit that has lost an eye, unless they can regenerate them back, will remain with that eye missing. it affects accuracy.
- Units that lose a leg have their speed reduced.
- Lightning does more damage (and is more accurate) against targets with metallic armor or under spells that turn their skin to bronze or gold.

All of this and more, in a game where your enemies try to take your RIGHTFUL title of the God of the next ages. May the best God rule all. | I love this game I play it nearly every day and often nothing but it. I can't say in good conscience that I recommend it to others though simply because of how obtuse it is. I don't want it to be less complex and I certainly don't want any features to be taken away from it.

What I would like is if the game explained itself and it's mechanics a little more thoroughly or how things interacted better. There's not really any good reason for how poorly written a lot of the tooltips are, or how it doesn't do something to the effect of having things like path improvements to spells multiplied in the explanation for the player. I don't like the communities standard answer to new players of read the manual, not because I don't think people should you absolutely have to in order to really grasp this game. I think that telling people to read and memorize a 500 page document is probably not a reasonable standard to entry for a game. 

I get that Illwinter is a passion project by two people to make something they love, and I think the series focus should remain as such. But I think maybe hiring a third person to explain what's going on in took tips a little better might be a way to maintain the feel of the series without detracting from it. Basic things like putting in blessed if they stack with units that already have those attributes (examples like invuln blesses or fire shield, barkskin explains how it stacks or doesn't why can't they?).

If you asked me two months ago if I recommended this the answer would be a resounding yes, but I've tried to teach a few friends to play this and it's really interesting and fun when we use mechanics to discover new ways to play we hadn't thought about. I don't think those moments should be interfered with, I think they're the heart of the series and should be preserved at all cost. I think the game should explain itself well enough they happen more frequently. More players would be better for dominions if they were gained right. You've probably made a quarter of a million dollars on this game, I think if you hired the right technical writer you could probably make that a million and dominions would be better for all of us, and it would give the devs more time to focus on the parts of the game they clearly enjoy more.

Tldr hire lucid tactics or something you'd probably make money in the long run. Best game ever made thumbs down! | There is so much variety, many different nations who all play very differently, different Gods, even different ages. None of these choices are window dressing, they all drastically change the way the game is played.

don't mind bad graphics and a clunky old-school UI, 
Don't mind a purely turn-based/autobattler experience (Autobattler with a ton of depth and some amount of control)

I'd give this game a solid 4/5. I've played the free version for a week or two, after which I decided to purchase it on Steam. Even though from the very beginning I knew that one of the maps (Forgotten Castle) lags like there's no tomorrow -- I still opted to buy the game as a show of great appreciation for the game you're cooking there, my dev bros. My machine isn't powerful, but I have absolutely no problem playing in Goblin holes or the Frozen caves -- the castle is the only place I have this issue; and not just the occasional freeze, but constant nagging lagging, which results in me having played on that map only thrice throughout these 30 hours, or the 40 more that I've played on the EpicGames version. 

Otherwise -- most brilliant of games, and most brilliant of concepts. There's nothing quite like this experience, especially after you learn that none of the gear, even hidden deep in your hard-bought stashes is there forever. The game does a rollover every so often, and everybody has to start with absolutely nothing, and once you learn that -- something sparks in you. There is something absolutely visceral in the realization that the potions that you hoard for 'a later more important dungeon' may just one day disappear without ever having been used. Then you begin playing the game with actually having fun! An absolutely lovely touch! 

If you like hard games that reward learning the complex (but comfortably so) mechanics, but also enjoy the goofiness of jolly cooperation, and the occasional toxic backstabbing -- this would be your cup of coffee. For tea will not sustain you during the long nights you might spend playing this gem. Just please, for the love of all that is cute in this world -- optimize the third map. 

And please, don't abandon this game, it has some rare potential | It is a cool concept but it needs a lot of work. It also needs so lighting changes. The game is way to dark. I know the irony of it. | игра ебаный кусок калла, разработчики долбаебы, 3к деревянных просят за сырую баганую, вечно стакающкю тебя игру, ты парируешь атаку? а хуй тебе атака сквозь меч, тебя хуй пойми как убили, просотр смерти, но толку если сервера гавно пинг в России гавно и ты на демо видишь как противник не попадает в тебя, мало того расстояние до тебя иногда колоссальное чуть ли не 180 градусов тычковой атакой, адаптируйся,  ты стараешься заучить босса, а хуй тебе отмена анимации и ты ловишь в ебало, стоишь на месте, держишь пери на 1м месте, тебя бьет крип едиственной атакой шанс парировать примерно 70/30 а почему? а потому что игра кусок дерьма, сервера картошки, скорее все эти проблемы из за пинга, меня заебал пинг в кс, но здесь это возведено в абсолют, можно сколько угодно оправдывать игру ""в раннем доступе"" но за 3к она не должна быть настолько обрыганской, задумка классная, механика (если исключить стаки в 1м паучке, телепортацией мобов и кучу других багов) тоже, реализация в дерьме, разработчик долбаеб и вместо популярных багфиксов выкатывает свой хуй,  1 словом игра сырая, баганная, но я продолжу играть и жрать это гавно, всем спасибо, отцам разраба дизлайк | Pve Bosses Are Way Too Hard. think there should be a way to play the game solo to learn pve fairly without wasting all your time"

unfortunately means that you are basically forced to play the flavour of the month nation if you actually want to win a game

thankfully devoid of modern fps trends such as shiny flashy gross skins, ""operators"" and whatever other awful slop the likes of cod and whatever does

grind is nowhere near as bad as wt, its free anyway so give it a try

also vietnam update pls pls pls"
