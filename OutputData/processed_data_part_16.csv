Well, there were games like Half-Life 2 back in 2000s, of course, but not every game was even close to that level. Still, this game starts like horror of some sort and I think it should have kept such style. But apparently devs had different vision. By the way you can try to play it on easy because the game is pretty damn hard. | This is a hard negative review but I cannot put a neutral one so be it then. It is from 2006 but even for these standards the writing is just atrocious - they started strong with some survival horror mechanics just to go full generic mediocre alien shoter clone in just next part where you have just to kill and move and watch not to die - not very much to be expecting from. The voice acting is just bad, the story is just bland and the ending - well it is anticlimactic. Nostalgia prevents me from shitting on this game byt it is not strong enough to pat it on the head. | Топовая для своих лет игрулька .Купил из ностальгии ( как-как найдя в интернете её название ) , но если быть не придирчивым, то неплохой шутер с видом сверху с малым элементом хоррора , а  если по шаманить в папках разрешение и настройки графики , так и ещё графон не самый плохой будет! | cheap and amazing! good game!"
76561198032898393,220,Half-Life 2,5.133333333333334,Action,6,"A monumental game in my gaming career, Half-Life 2 was that defining experience that made me realise I was in for something next level. For the first time i picked it up on The Orange Box in 2008, and from the moment I booted it up, I knew I was in for a wild ride. It wasn’t just a game—it was an event. The environments were absolutely massive, the atmosphere was unreal, and the soundtrack? Edgy as hell. Every moment felt like a cinematic journey.

In Half-Life 2, you play as Gordon Freeman, arguably one of the most reluctant action heroes in gaming. You awaken from stasis, burdened with the trauma of the previous game, and are immediately thrust into action as the figurehead of an uprising. This isn’t a simple revolution—it’s a battle against a multiversal alien threat, shrouded in dystopian themes and orchestrated by secretive organizations manipulating events behind the scenes.

Set in a world dominated by the Combine, an alien regime that combines interdimensional authoritarianism with advanced technology, you must navigate a planet under their control. Armed with little more than a crowbar and your signature nonverbalism, Gordon becomes the key figure in the resistance. As you progress, you'll engage in intense combat, solve puzzles, explore diverse environments, and uncover the unsettling truth that nothing in this world is as it seems.

And let’s talk about The G-Man—a mysterious, interdimensional CIA glowman who pops up like a bad dream and probably controls the entire charade like a cosmic puppeteer. Is he good? Is he bad? Is he just playing the long game? Who knows, but he’s definitely got his hand in everything, watching Gordon like a hawk, pulling strings like an invisible god. 

You’d think it’s just a sci-fi conspiracy, but after a while, you start questioning if anyone really knows what the hell is going on. Does G-Man even have a purpose, or is he just a cosmic observer who gets his kicks out of watching a man with a crowbar take on the end of the world?

The game’s narrative feels like a giant puzzle, and each step forward opens up even more questions, all while you’re tearing through enemy lines, trying to get answers. And the best part? It’s not all about combat—there are puzzles to solve, mysteries to uncover, and a sense of isolation that keeps you on edge, constantly wondering who or what will show up next. The pacing is incredible, making you feel like you’re a tiny piece of something far larger, with consequences that span across dimensions.

Now when the episodes are combines (haha) The user experience is smooth and now it is even moddable! 5/5 | 之前20周年更新开发者评论模式后我又打了一遍，阀是怎样做到的，让我反复爱上它们的游戏。在游戏里跟开发者评论一起探索是我最喜欢的事，我喜欢看游戏开发历程和小故事，实在是让人大开眼界。
为什么这个滑梯不能上去，这个跷跷板是可以玩的，原来这里也有小巧思，这里的电线是视觉引导物，怎样保持一个休闲和紧张的平衡，能在游戏里亲自上手跟看GDC或者工具箱是完全不一样的体验，我会贪婪地希望每一个我喜欢的游戏都添加开发者评论。 | ""Half-Life 2"" is one of the most influential and groundbreaking first-person shooters ever made. Released in 2004 by Valve, it redefined what players could expect from a video game in terms of both storytelling and gameplay. The game’s narrative is immersive, unfolding without traditional cutscenes, which allows the player to feel like they are truly part of the story. The protagonist, Gordon Freeman, is a silent hero who navigates through a dystopian world filled with alien invaders and oppressive human forces. This unique approach to storytelling pulls the player into the game’s world, making every action feel meaningful.

The physics engine in ""Half-Life 2"" was revolutionary for its time. The way objects interact with the environment feels natural and intuitive, and it became a major part of the gameplay. From solving puzzles using physics to creatively using the environment as a weapon, it was an innovation that influenced many games that followed. The gravity gun, which allows players to manipulate objects in real-time, is still one of the most memorable and fun weapons in gaming history.

The level design in ""Half-Life 2"" is another standout feature. The game introduces players to varied environments, from the dark, industrial city of City 17 to the eerie, remote marshlands. Each location feels carefully crafted, with attention to detail that makes the world feel alive. The pacing is also masterful, alternating between moments of intense combat and slower, atmospheric sequences that allow the player to soak in the environment and story.

The AI in ""Half-Life 2"" was also ahead of its time. Enemies behave intelligently, using cover, working together, and reacting to the player’s actions in a way that makes combat more dynamic and challenging. The enemy variety, from the terrifying Combine soldiers to the creepy headcrabs, keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging. The interactions with NPCs and the world around you help build a sense of tension and immersion, keeping you on edge throughout the experience.

The game's soundtrack, composed by Kelly Bailey, perfectly complements the atmosphere, using subtle but effective music to enhance both the action and the quieter moments. The sound design is top-notch, with ambient sounds adding to the immersion, whether you're in a busy city street or exploring a deserted warehouse.

Ultimately, ""Half-Life 2"" is a masterpiece that still holds up to this day. Its innovative gameplay, storytelling, and technical achievements make it a game that set a new standard for the industry. It’s a game that’s not just fun to play, but one that’s easy to appreciate for the way it shaped the future of video games. Even though it’s been years since its release, ""Half-Life 2"" remains a classic that continues to inspire both players and developers alike.

 | game is fire but whoever designed the puzzles and the vehicle section i hope you never work in games again. also barney thick as hell | Half-Life 2 is quite a game and i don't know what to say about it other than its a personal favourite. I think its one of my favourite of the Half-Life games just for all the upgrades it brings. The physics and all the new graphics and visuals. Its truly a great leap in the series and i love how far the story has come and how everything was ended nicely.

The story was more developed and the characters had more dialogue with each other and you saw some past characters return quite nicely. The aliens returned in this sequel to the first Half-Life and once again you had to beat them back. You are led through multiple chapters in the game defeating enemies and playing through some thought provoking puzzles as per the series standard.

One thing i miss is that the game ended on an unfortunate cliff hanger and so far there seems to be no sign of a sequel at all. The story needs finishing and has spent way to long without any news at all about its future and will be in limbo for some time.

The game without a doubt in my mind is the best in the series and one of my favourites. Its a easy game to recommend anyone try out and play in the future."

Half-Life: Deathmatch: Source is a multiplayer first-person shooter developed by Valve. It is a remake of the classic Half-Life deathmatch mode, utilizing the Source engine. The game combines the fast-paced action of traditional deathmatch with updated graphics and more fluid movement mechanics. While it successfully brings new life to the original concept, some mechanical issues and a niche player base prevent it from being as popular as its predecessors.

What Works Well?
🎮 Classic Deathmatch Gameplay
The core of Half-Life: Deathmatch is its tight, fast-paced combat. It stays true to the original deathmatch mode, offering classic weapons, high-speed action, and simple, enjoyable mechanics. The formula remains as fun today as it was when first introduced.

🌆 Updated Graphics with Source Engine
The move to the Source engine has significantly improved the visuals compared to the original. The lighting, textures, and models are much sharper, breathing new life into the iconic Half-Life universe. The environments feel more immersive, and physics interactions are more dynamic.

🔫 Familiar Weapon Set
Players have access to a variety of classic weapons from the Half-Life series, including the crowbar, shotgun, and crossbow, all of which perform as expected. Each weapon has its own strategic value, and they all function well within the confines of the deathmatch setting.

🛠️ Modding Support and Custom Servers
As with other Source engine games, Deathmatch: Source allows for a robust modding community. Players can easily find custom servers and user-created content, from new maps to modified gameplay modes, keeping the experience fresh.

What Could Be Better?
❌ Limited Popularity and Player Base
Despite its solid foundation, Half-Life: Deathmatch: Source suffers from a relatively small player base. As newer games in the genre continue to dominate, it can be difficult to find active matches, especially in more niche servers.

❌ Physics Can Feel Clunky
While the Source engine improved many aspects of the game, some of the physics—especially in terms of movement—can feel a little awkward compared to modern shooters. The transition to 3D space feels a bit more restrictive than anticipated, particularly when compared to the fluidity of more modern games.

❌ No Significant Gameplay Innovation
While the updated graphics and better physics are great, Deathmatch: Source doesn't introduce any major changes to the original formula. It feels more like a polished port rather than a revolutionary step forward for the genre. Players expecting something drastically new may be disappointed.

❌ Lack of Meaningful Progression
Like many classic deathmatch games, there’s a lack of meaningful progression or any form of unlockable content. While this keeps the focus on pure skill-based play, some players may miss the more modern systems that reward long-term engagement.

Conclusion
Half-Life: Deathmatch: Source is a solid multiplayer shooter for fans of the classic Half-Life experience. Its updated visuals and iconic weapons deliver the fun, high-speed action that fans love, but its small player base and lack of major innovation hold it back from achieving greater popularity. If you’re looking for nostalgic deathmatch action or enjoy modding, it’s a great choice, but don’t expect a revolutionary experience.

Rating: 7/10 – Fun for fans of classic shooters, but somewhat limited by its age and player base. 🎮💥 | It’s good and there are still servers if ur in europe buy it if ur not in eu you’ll probably have shit connection so don’t | 这老东西没人玩了，只能选人数不到两位数的服务器进去小玩一下。

 | Minha análise sincera de Portal.

Queria eu fazer uma análise sincera sobre esse jogo, mas não há necessidade, esse jogo dispensa qualquer elogio, um jogo a frente de seu tempo, criativo, divertido, com uma das melhores vilãs que já vi, isso só ouvindo sua voz.

Still Alive, esse jogo é GOAT e sempre será. | 07년도에 출시한 3D 퍼즐 게임.

제목대로 포탈을 타면서 여러 퍼즐들을 해치우면 되는 그런 게임이다.

출시된지 오래된 게임이지만, 완성도가 굉장히 높은 게임이고 이를 증명하듯 현재에도 많은 유저들이 플레이하고 있는 갓겜.

3D멀미가 있는 사람들에게는 조금 힘들 수 있고 몇몇 퍼즐은 피지컬적인 요소가 꽤 들어가 있지만, 퍼즐의 완성도는 정말 높은 게임.

참고) 오래된 게임인만큼 커뮤니티나 인터넷에 공략들도 많이 돌아다니고 있으니 진행하다가 혹은 도전과제  진행시 막히면 참고도 가능하다. | Fun game, burns a lot of time. Its really fun, and has great puzzles. this is an example of what games should be like. this game is magnificant, if there was a horror game like this i would be in love frr. This game is amazing

76561198032898393,21000,LEGO® Batman™: The Videogame,2.35,"Action, Adventure",0,"I have been having a blast revisiting this old timey gem! It works pretty well overall, but there are a few important things to consider before you buy.

First of all, there are occasional crashes. Emphasis on occasional; I don't get too many. But they do happen.

Second, it is IMPERATIVE that you turn on VSync in the options. Otherwise, Tech Suit Robin's car CANNOT go up slopes and you will be softlocked. So go into options, highlight the Vsync option, and move the arrow keys/control stick to the left/right. (Yes, it's a weird control option.)

Once you do that, though, you should be home free! I do recommend playing this with controller, but it is playable on keyboard. | I love this game on other platforms, but here it's heavily bugged that impedes my progress. When my character is standing on a pressure plate or jumping platform, it bugs out and prevents me from jumping. (Leaving me to failing jumps over and over again.) And there are sections where vehicles can't go upstairs like the final level in the villain penguin campaign. The game requires you to drive up the main entrance of the arctic building to smash an ice wall the enter. But the car just stays stuck at the base.

Until the bugs get fixed, I say people play the console versions of this game. | Blast from the Past!

Lego Batman was my first introduction to the Dark Knight, and it quickly became one of my favorite childhood games when it was released. Now, 15 years later, I finally got the chance to replay it—and it still holds up!

From the engaging story to the fun, dynamic gameplay, everything about this game is just as enjoyable as I remember. While I did encounter a few occasional glitches, they were easy to work around and didn’t take away from the overall experience.

This game holds a special place in my heart, and for good reason. 9/10—still a classic! | Even though I never had this game growing up unlike Lego Star Wars The Complete Saga and Lego Indiana Jones The Original Adventures, I still had an absolute blast playing through this game. Getting to play it from not only the hero's perspective, but the villain's perspective as well is a genius concept that I really wished more Lego games tried this concept. I definitely recommend this game for those getting into the Lego games. | Totalmente recomendado. Es una joya para re-jugar mas de una vez, ya que tiene muchísimo contenido.

76561198032898393,29180,Osmos,2.5166666666666666,"Casual, Indie",1,"Osmos is a game that admittedly is somewhat special to me, in light that it was one of the items acquired for the still-deemed-to-be-almost-completely-insignificant 8th Grade Graduation event in 2010, yet also a completely baffling, confounding, fundamentally broken experience.

I haven't the foggiest of clues how literally [b]anyone[/b] could try to play through 2 of the three level branches in-game, and not only deem it a [b]finished product[/b] that's ready to send to market, but also charge $10 for it. Similarly, I very much want to know which game everybody that pushed its Metacritic Score up to [b]EIGHTY[/b] was playing, and/or how much of it was done so before passing judgement.

To delve into what's wrong with this slow, plodding, almost-entirely-unengaging disaster, I first need to have you, dear reader, imagine you're playing literally any game with a level (style of game doesn't matter), and end goal for said stage. 

Now imagine that instead of making sure you have even the [b]chance[/b] of [b]starting to play[/b] this level, you instead need to repeatedly pause and generate a new map to make sure the game bothers giving you collision to stand on, then literally anything else that's needed to clear said stage.

I would say “This is at least two levels in Osmos”, however, this analogy is not over, because even if the game you're imagining gives you a starting piece of terrain, allows you to move within it, and grants you the equipment needed to have a chance at beating the stage, no guarantee exists the end goal was generated alongside it, 

This is to say that after spending sometimes up to 10 minutes trying to beat this stage, you can be at the second to last action needed to fulfil the objective, only to find the switch you needed to push, unit you needed to spawn, and/or edge of the platform you need to jump from to get to the goal is completely missing.

Guess what this means you need to do? Keep generating a new map until the basics are granted, then hope the game gave you a complete level that can finished this time around.

[b][u]This is to say that levels in Osmos are not designed, they're generated, and not only that, seemingly nothing by any flags, checks, or programs are in-place to make sure said stage can be completed was bothered to be programmed[/u][/b], making the gameplay loop “play until you get stuck on a level, regenerate said level until you can even start to play it, and hope that the system blessed you with the apparently unheard-of privilege of being able to beat said stage.

I have gone back to this game at least twice since acquiring it almost 15 years ago, and each time, I reached a “level” that's not only entirely reliant on RNG to be able to not only do anything at-all in, but seemingly completely unable to be finished.

The first revisit saw one of the “Force” clusters be perpetually beyond even beginning, and while the A3B cluster seemed doable at first, after – no joke – at least 30 restarts, 1 hour and a half wasted, and only 15 that I wasn't completely blocked out of doing anything with, none of those were finished.

It gets worse, though, because in order to have a chance at defeating any enemy (in this case stationary blobs for most of the levels I bothered even trying to play) you – so to speak – need to take health from yourself, and give it to whichever adversary you may be facing. This already sounds completely unreasonable, but once you assimilate the “Health” of the other enemy, you grow to their size, unable to get through corridors, and use weaker ones to hope to try and beat the bigger ones, while hoping beyond hope nothing happens to give imperative health to your adversary, causing it to grow bigger, and completely block you off from progressing.

[b][u]The fundamental laws of game design state:[/u][/b]

1: If you must have a randomiser take the place of intentional design, include checks, and flags, then redundancy on redundancy to make sure every level can be completed via player agency, and skill, rather than the randomiser putting everything in.

2: Once these are in-place, make absolutely sure that everything it makes can be consistently completed, playing each level multiple times, and perhaps have multiple people also do so, to increase the amount of tested instances/generations.

3: Once everything is confirmed to be working [b][u]then[/u][/b] publish it.

As such, we reach the

[b][u]Verdict:[/u][/b] A seemingly-untested, unfinished-feeling frustration-fest that relies entirely on luck to allow the player to do anything, with two levels either taking hours of restarts to beat, or otherwise are completely impossible to finish.

[b][u]Placed In:[/u][/b] Were this acquired on any other occasion, I would have 0 qualms whatsoever about ousting it from my account such that I never have the temptation to be disappointed by it in the future again, but as it stands, it's shakily at 6: Traumatically Toxic, and “Remove it anyway.” | Klassiker"

[b]Alquimia[/b]

O uso de poções não é opcional, é OBRIGATÓRIO. Neste jogo você precisa coletar itens como plantas e partes de animais, comprar e ler formulas para poções e óleos, crafta-los e usar de acordo com o contexto, inimigo e sua estratégia. Essas informações custam caro no jogo, tanto em tempo conversando com npcs quanto em ouro para comprar as formulas. 

[b]Inimigos e Combates[/b]

A parte mais divertida para mim e mais odiada para outros. No jogo você possui uma espada de prata e uma de aço, além de 3 estilos de combate, você precisa usar a arma certa no estilo de combate certo contra o inimigo certo, e juntamente com isso combinar a magia e alquimia para explorar as fraquezas dos adversários, isso é fundamental especialmente nos chefes. 

Os pontos fracos dos monstros e chefes do jogo também não são de graça, você precisa comprar livros, e falar com npcs para descobri-los, o que você pode facilmente perder durante a progressão do game ou simplesmente ficar sem dinheiro para adquirir as informações, deixando o game mais difícil e menos rico em termos de lore. De posse da informação você precisa ficar consultado o codex do jogo para elaborar as estratégias de combate. 

As coisas não explicitas no codex, por exemplo, ele diz que o chefe do primeiro capitulo é pouco vulnerável a magia Aard, se você se deu o trabalho de aprender ou usar a magia Aard em combate sabe que ela tonteia os inimigos possibilitando que você os mate com um só golpe. 

De posse dessas duas informações você pode elaborar a estratégia de fortalecer o Aard para matar o chefe ""super difícil"" do capitulo 1 com apenas um golpe.

Uma coisa importante é que a história avança de forma inesperada, é normal coisas ficarem para trás na primeira jogada, sempre tenha isso em mente ao entrar em um lugar ou completar uma quest, as vezes o jogo avança e algumas quests não podem ser completadas, outras o jogador acaba deixando passar.

このレビューが皆様の役に立つことを願っております。

ちなみにThe Witcher 2も、windows10で動作します。

 | A rough gem with an awesome story and a wonky/horrible combat system. Worthy for rpg fans and people who do not mind a bit of an old school jank | Bu incelemeyi yazmak için uzunca bir süre bekledim aslında..

Sebebine birazdan değineceğim.

[i]Abi o oyunun kombat sistemi çok kötü nasıl dayanabiliyorsun ?
Abi o oyunda boşuna vakit kaybetme 2. oyundan başlarsan hikayenin ne olduğunu anlarsın.
Abi o oyunun grafikleri çok kötü ya 5 dakika oynadıktan sonra etrafı piksel görmeye başladım.[/i]

Bunlar burada dursun..

Yapmayın oğlum söylemeyin şöyle şeyler..

Genel anlamda internet ortamında açıkça ve rahatlıkla eleştiri yapacak bir düzeye gelmişken ayrıca bir çok şeye tek bir tıkla ulaşıp araştırma imkanınız varken kendi fikirlerinizi oluşturmayıp neden başkalarından duyduğunuz şeyleri savunuyor ve insanlara yanlış algılar hediye ediyorsunuz ?

Yapmayın..

""Gerekli laf söyleme kısmını geçtiğimi göre şimdi oyundan bahsedebiliriz""

Her şeyin başlangıcı olarak verilmese de karakteri tanımamız ve hikayeyi anlayabilmemiz için gerekli oyun olarak karşımıza çıkıyor Witcher 1.

Çok güzel bir senaryo hazırlanmış öncesi hakkında bir fikrimiz yok sonrası ise tamamen muamma ilerledikçe kendimize ve hikayeye dair ip uçları ediniyor ve bir şekilde kafamızda yaşananları şekillendirmeye başlıyoruz.

[spoiler]Oyunun en başında karşımıza çıkan çocuğun en sonunda karşımıza çıkacağını kim bilebilir ki ?[/spoiler]

Oyun sırasında çok fazla npc ile diyalog kurabiliyor ana karakterimiz adına seçim yapmamız gereken çok fazla sahne ile karşılaşıyoruz.

Yetenek ağacı ise gerçekten harika oynamak istediğiniz stile yatırım yaptıkça harika kombolar ve hızlandırmalar sunuyor.

Dövüş sistemi sanıldığının aksine birazcık refleks birazcık dikkatli oynamak mantığında ilerliyor yeterli upgrade'leri alırsanız karşınızdaki 10 kişiyi havada 5 takla atarak inanılmaz artist şekillerde kesebiliyorsunuz.

Görev mantığı ise harika tüm oyunlarında olduğu gibi hangisinin side hangisinin main quest olduğunu size veriyor ve en önemli kısmı o görevleri yapabilmek için sadece bulunduğunuz haritada değil başka haritalara gidip gelebiliyorsunuz.

""Emek veriyorsunuz""

Bu oyun için gerçekten emek veriyorsunuz eski olmasına rağmen tek bir anında bile beni sıkmayan başından saatlerce kalkmadığım bir oyun oldu Witcher benim için.

Her anında insanları tek tek tanımak hikayelerini dinlemek yeri geldiğinde sarhoş olup ağzınlarından laf almak yeri geldiğinde genel evdeki kızlara çiçek götürmek her anı ile gerçekten harika bir oyun Witcher 1.

Yaptığım seçimler sırasında gerçekten zorlandığım noktalar oldu ben olsam ne yapardım Gerald aslında ne yapar kısımlarında bazı seçim ekranlarında oturup düşünmüşlüğüm var ve her şeyin sonunda tamamen benim verdiğim kararlara göre şekillenmiş bir son çıktı karşıma.,

Oyun beni tatmin etti mi ? Fazlasıyla..
Oyundan keyif aldım mı ? İnanılmaz derece..
Peki oyunun grafikleri çok mu kötü ? Hayır kesinlikle değil
Peki oyunun combat sistemi çok mu saçma ya da çok mu zor ? Hayır aslında inanılmaz basit
Peki gerçekten hikayeyi anlamak için ilk oyunu oynamamız mı gerekiyor ? ""EVET""

Neden bu kadar agresif cevaplar veriyorum ? şu yüzden..

Oyuna başladığım günün sabahında Discord da masum masum oyunu oynuyorken discordda ki arkadaşlarımızdan birisi yanıma geldi ve sırf Enis K. isimli youtuber'ın videosunu izlediği için abi o oyuna rework şart yaa gibisinden bir cümle kullandı..
Mikrofondan yumruk atabilmeyi gerçekten çok isterdim..

İlk oyunu oynamana gerek yok diğer oyunlarda hikayeyi anlayabiliyorsun diyen arkadaşlarım dostlarım..
İlk oyunda öldürüp öldürmemenin kararı sana bırakılmış karakterler diğer oyunda sırf senin yaptığın seçime göre karşına çıkabiliyorken..
3. Oyunda dahi diyaloğa gireceğimiz karakterlerin başlangıç hikayelerini ilk oyunda öğrenirken..
Firma oyunun hikayesinin temelini ilk oyunda yaptığını açıklamışken ne demek lan ilk oyunu oynama diğer oyunlarda anlaşılıyor ??

Düşünsene Matrix'i öneriyorsun arkadaşına ve diyorsun ki ilk film'i izleme adam işte Matrix oluyor..
Lan oluyor da o sırada yaşadıkları ne oluyor ? o etrafındaki insanlar nereden geliyor ? o herif Matrix olana kadar neler çekiyor ?

Oyun indirim döneminde ciklet parasına kadar düşüyorken lütfen alıp kendiniz tecrübe edin..
Yine beğenmezseniz ben hep buradayım. Oturur konuşur tartışırız.


Dikkat: "" Bu incelemeyi okurken yorum ekranında bol bol devrik cümle, erken bitirilmiş diyaloglar ve açıklamalarda yumuşatılma hissedebilirsiniz. İnsanlara atar yapmamam gerektiğini kendime söyleyerek yazmış birisi olarak bu açıklamayıp da yapma gereksinimi duydum "" 

Teşekkürler.

The combat and graphics in this game are detailed
and makes the game one to revisit for years to come
10/10 game | The first real game I ever played was LEGO® Star Wars™ - The Complete Saga, excluding Flash games. Honestly, it's a masterpiece in every way. The comedy, charm, and creativity make this an unforgettable experience. Also, after playing LEGO® Star Wars™: The Skywalker Saga, I found it surprising that you cannot design your own Jedi or Sith even though it is a newer game. Instead, you're trapped with a predetermined cast of characters. However, in The Complete Saga, you can create your own personalized characters by mixing and matching pieces as desired. That increased freedom is why The Complete Saga is the GOAT. It allows you to actually play out your own Star Wars experience in a way that the newer game just doesn’t. 10/10 | It's all a bit old, and the multiplayer isn't properly implemented for that, but it's a classic for a reason. Solid entertainment with lots of fun bits to explore. | Could be on a top 10 list for the greatest video games of all time. Perhaps is the greatest LEGO video game of all time. Not many games can stand the test of time like this one has, with a near perfect reception record. Thank you for this beautiful gift you have so graciously given us, developers. | Lego Star Wars The Complete Saga is honestly a great way to experience and learn more about the Star Wars series.
Its so charming, easy to pickup and enjoy that both children and adults can have a blast playing it. Its exactly what you expect from a Lego game so if you keep your expectations accordingly, you won't be disappointed.

I only have a couple of minor nitpicks. First one is most of the vehicle levels absolutely suck and also the majority of the levels overstay their welcome by making you do repetitive tasks that add nothing both to the gameplay and the story. I believe that most levels could've been much more fun and remarkable if they were shorter and more straight to the point. 

Apart from such minor nitpicks i really think Lego Star Wars is a fun game suitable for all ages thus I can recommend it to everyone."

 | The game also comes with a DLC, which includes the following items:

1. A Toxic Community: Mistakes are rarely forgiven. Unless you’re playing with friends, be prepared to face harsh criticism, often from younger players. The game’s multiplayer is largely populated by school-aged players who don’t hold back.


2. Disruptive Adults: It’s not just the kids causing chaos—some adults blast music through their microphones, assuming everyone else shares their taste. Spoiler: they don’t.


3. Frequent AFKs: Teamwork can fall apart when a teammate goes inactive, whether they’re brewing tea, taking a smoke break, or simply wandering off mid-game. And yes, it often happens right after you’ve generously used your first aid kit on them.


4. Team Abandonment: Lone wolves running off to the far corners of the map, only to be overwhelmed by infected, are a common sight. They’re quick to flood the chat with colorful language before rage-quitting the game.


5. Difficulty Disputes: Some players join games on ""Expert"" difficulty only to demand a downgrade. If their request is denied, they might sabotage the team before leaving the server entirely.


6. Vote Kicks: Occasionally, you’ll encounter players who inexplicably start a vote to kick you from the game. When you ask why? Crickets.



The Verdict: Despite the chaotic community, Left 4 Dead 2 remains a phenomenal experience. The graphics are a significant step up from the first game, the mechanics feel more polished, and there’s a greater variety of weapons and infected to enjoy. However, surviving the online experience without a calming remedy might be just as challenging as surviving the zombie apocalypse itself. | Крутая игра для игры с друзьями (которые в это не играют)!

Featuring intense survival gameplay, smart AI, and an incredible atmosphere, L4D2 delivers an unmatched multiplayer experience. With its fast-paced action, diverse weapons, and unpredictable enemy encounters, this game remains one of the most thrilling and replayable co-op shooters ever made.

Gameplay – Pure, Adrenaline-Fueled Action
L4D2 is all about co-op survival. You and three teammates must fight through hordes of the undead, navigating through various maps and completing objectives to reach safety. The key to survival? Teamwork, strategy, and adaptability.

The gunplay is tight and satisfying, with a wide selection of weapons including assault rifles, shotguns, SMGs, sniper rifles, and melee weapons like axes, katanas, and even frying pans! Every encounter feels dynamic, thanks to the AI Director, which adjusts the difficulty based on your team’s performance, ensuring no two playthroughs are ever the same.

Special Infected – Enemies That Keep You on Edge
Beyond the standard zombie horde, L4D2 introduces Special Infected that force players to work together:

Tank – A massive brute that can throw debris and crush survivors.
Witch – A terrifying enemy that, if startled, can instantly incapacitate a survivor.
Smoker – Uses a long tongue to drag players away from their team.
Hunter – A fast, agile infected that pounces on survivors and pins them down.
Boomer – Explodes in a shower of bile, attracting a massive horde.
Charger – Charges through groups, slamming a survivor into the ground.
Spitter – Creates pools of acid that deal heavy damage.
Each Special Infected forces different team strategies, making communication and positioning absolutely crucial.

Campaigns & Maps – A Horror Movie Experience
L4D2 features multiple campaigns, each set in diverse, apocalyptic locations across the southern U.S.:

Dead Center – A chaotic mall escape reminiscent of classic zombie films.
The Parish – A tense race across New Orleans to reach an evacuation zone.
Swamp Fever – A creepy, foggy swamp filled with infected dangers.
Hard Rain – A unique campaign featuring a devastating hurricane that changes the environment.
Dark Carnival – A fan-favorite, featuring a deadly amusement park with a thrilling rollercoaster finale.
Each campaign feels like a mini zombie movie, packed with cinematic set pieces, interactive environments, and intense finales.

Multiplayer & Game Modes – Endless Replayability
L4D2 offers several game modes that keep the action fresh:

Campaign Mode – Classic co-op survival through story-driven levels.
Versus Mode – One team plays as survivors, while the other controls the Special Infected.
Survival Mode – See how long you can last against endless waves of zombies.
Scavenge Mode – A competitive mode where teams race to collect fuel cans while being hunted.
Mutation Mode – Weekly game modifiers that add fun twists to gameplay.
Thanks to modding support and the Steam Workshop, the community has also created hundreds of custom maps, weapons, and campaigns, making L4D2’s replayability practically infinite.

Graphics & Sound – Immersive and Timeless
Even years after release, L4D2’s atmospheric lighting, detailed environments, and gruesome effects hold up well. Zombies react realistically to gunfire, and the sound design is masterful, with eerie background noises, terrifying growls from Special Infected, and intense musical cues that heighten the suspense.

The voice acting and character interactions bring the survivors to life, making them memorable and adding humor to the chaos.

Why Left 4 Dead 2 is a Must-Play
L4D2 is the perfect blend of action, horror, and co-op gameplay. Whether you’re playing with friends or AI teammates, the intense combat, unpredictable enemy encounters, and endless replayability make every match a thrilling adventure.

🔹 Final Rating: 10/10
Left 4 Dead 2 is a masterpiece of cooperative gaming. If you love zombies, action, and teamwork, this is an absolute must-play that still delivers endless fun and excitement after more than a decade.

76561198032898393,8190,Just Cause 2,0.45,"Action, Adventure",1,"one of the best games I could possibly recommend for low end computers. incredible gameplay and great story | Game is automatically incredible because of the parachute and grappling hook mechanic. | Tried this game several times over the years and hallelujah it finally clicked. Had a handful of crashes and a few freezes, but this game definitely holds up and is completely addicting. After 71 hours for 75% I feel like I'm just starting to get good at the controls. 10/10 am playing again on hardest difficulty. | [h1]This game is a gift that keeps on giving.[/h1] 

Even if you don't feel like playing through the story, much like GTA, you can mess about around the map. One of my favourite things to do is using the grappling hook to string people up from the street lights. You can drive around the map and take in the beautiful scenery (or fly if you feel like it), and you can [b]just cause[/b] mayhem! | Etrafta uçup kaçıp kaos yaratmak. Oyun bundan fazlasını vaat ediyor ama o fazlası olan her şey 2010 senesi için bile çok dandik. 

Hikayede Rico ve ekibi helikopter ile Güneydoğu Asya'da bulunan rastgele bir diktatörlüğe amerikan emriyle demokrasi dağıtmaya gelir. Rico adaya varmak üzereyken bu adanın artık düşman bir hükümete sahip olduğunu öğrenir. Hemen sonrasında klasik helikoptere saldırı olur. Sonra da niyeyse Amerikan hükümeti ile alakalı çok önemli dosyaları helikopterde düşman topraklarına götürüyormuşuz ve onlar düşüp etrafa saçılır. Bu tarz başlayan ve bir kaka fırtınası olarak devam eden hikayeyi takmadığımız sürece kafamız rahat ediyor.

Neyse ki grappling hook ve onunla yapabileceklerimiz devreye girince özellikle dönemi için inanılmaz eğlenceli bir kaos yaratma serüveni başlıyor. Gameplay olarak düşmanlar ve gun play yine senesi için kötünün iyisi denebilir. Ki zaten çoğunlukla koşu silahla milleti taramak yerine etrafta uçup kaçıp bombalar fırlatıp her yeri patlatıyoruz şeklinde bir oynanışa sahibiz.

Steam versiyonu bozuk diyenler çok ki 30dk içerisinde bir kere çöktü ve bir kere de dört senelik pc'de ilk defa mavi ekrana sebep oldu steam versiyonuna özel mi bilmiyorum ama teknik olarak çok problemli olduğu kesin şu anki halinin. 

2024 yılında girince tabii o kadar ilginç gelmiyor oyun ama o dönem neler yapılıyormuş diye merak eder ve serinin üçüncü oyunu dışında güzel hangi oyunu var derseniz kesinlikle buna bakın derim."
76561198032898393,35140,Batman: Arkham Asylum Game of the Year Edition,38.46666666666667,"Action, Adventure",5,"Batman: Arkham Asylum was a pretty good experience except for the same boss schemes. Also this game has such a good PC port that I didn't even do a game configuration before going into the game. | Дивна річ ця пам’ять. У моїх спогадах, Психлікарня відповідала на 85% тому, що я побачив під час цього перепроходження, але враження та емоції були геть інші. Так вийшло, що перше знайомство відбулося з Arkham City, бо на той момент якраз була куплена нова відеокарта, а друг казав, що ця гра виглядає неймовірно й дуже вибаглива. Тож нереально приємно провівши час, десь за рік взявся за Asylum і по відчуттям, це було наче після Темного лицаря дивитися Бетмен: Початок. І те, і те – гарні фільмі, і те, і те – круті ігри, але коли вже побачив щось краще в тому ж усесвіті зі своїми правилами й механіками, початкові варіанти сприймаються звісно ж слабше. Проте, на момент написання рецензії, це відчуття недорозвинених ідей чи аспектів не повернулося, тому ще в першу ігрову сесію завершив проєкт на 33%, провівши з двома хвилинними перервами 7 годин.

Сюжет простий і зрозумілий, подиву викликати не має, хіба що в людей, які не знають хто такий Брюс Вейн. Починається все з того, що Джокер без проблем віддається в руки Бетмену й вони прямують у лікарню. Уже всередині закладу протагоніста не полишає думка, що це якийсь підступний план – звісно ж так і є. Поганець виривається на свободу й випускає різних суперзлочинців та хуліганів, які мають якомога довше затримувати Темного лицаря, щоб його супротивник міг утілювати свій підступний задум. Звісно ж під час проходження ми зустрінемо фан-сервіс… вибачте, усім знайомих ворогів – Страхопудала, Бейна, Плюща тощо. Я радий, що це відбулося, проте до них майже відсутнє якесь сценарне підведення (окрім Бейна, хіба що): вони виникають на нашому шляху й хочуть надавати кажану по вухах. Якщо перемішати їх місцями, зміни будуть незначні, а для загального бачення картини взагалі відсутні. Фінал теж доволі посередній, а порівнювати з Arkham City взагалі не варто – там у мене відвисла щелепа, а тут непоганий мордобій і все: відчуття наче це кінець сезону, а далі буде наступний.

Стосовно мордобою. Я не цікавився чи це оригінальна ідея, чи десь підгледіли, але саме в серії Arkham я вперше побачив цю систему вибивання всього лaйнa із супротивників. Першу серію ударів Бетмен робить звичайні, а на кожний наступний удар нокаутує ворога на короткий проміжок часу, а гравцю треба лише вчасно тиснути удар, щоб протагоніст з певною анімацією сам підлітав до найближчої пики в напрямку камери – виглядає досі бомбезно й спроби повторити так і не перевершили Rocksteady Studios. Є ухилення в сторону чи через когось, але повністю відсутній блок, тому для вдалого перехоплення атаки треба в таймінг тиснути контрудар – інакше комбо буде збито, а наш герой отримає шкоду. Може на словах це якась 2-3-кнопочна боївка (що так і є, хе-хе), але на практиці купа поганців може швидко обламати кажану крильця, не кажучи вже про те, як круто виглядає битва без пропущених ударів. До речі, на високій складності, яку я вибрав, над головою хуліганів відсутній індикатор, тому треба самому уважно дивитися хто коли б’є.

Щодо іншого ігрового процесу, то це метроїдванія без необхідності в примусовому порядку йти в попередні локації та потрапляти в раніше закриті зони через відсутність певних ґаджетів. Окрім декодера, для якого Бетмен використав спеціальну картку, трохи дивно спостерігати за тим, як він свої ж інструменти не носить із собою, а бере тільки в певний момент. Деякі, як от подвійний бетаранг, можна отримати лише в меню прокачки. За різні дії, знаходження секретів, набивання великих комбо видають досвід, який підвищує рівень. За кожний можна вибрати будь-яке одне відкрите покращення: асортимент невеликий, це або посилення фізичних ударів і збільшення здоров’я, чи просто розширення можливостей вищезгаданих ґаджетів, що загалом не є необхідним по сюжету, а слугує задля колекціонування.

Так, ніхто нікого не змушує кудись там іти, але ж самому хочеться, і це великий плюс. Територія лікарні невелика, але в різних закутках і не дуже знаходяться аудіозаписи сеансів з місцевими пацієнтами, що складає певне враження про їхній характер чи хід думок. На локаціях можна знайти купу щелеп Джокера, які направляють гравця на основний шлях: їх знищення дає досвід і відкриває загадки Ріддлера (я його буду так звати, бо український варіант – Загадник – мені якось не до вподоби). Окрім цього, він розкидав фігурки знаків питання, більшість з яких потребує саме прокачаних ґаджетів. Звісно ж не обійшлося без загадок: у більшості кімнат треба знайти щось, що є відповіддю на них. Для цього необхідно використати унікальну механіку детектива: Бетмен починає бачити все навколо в рентгені з підсвідкою об’єктів та інформацією щодо оточення; якщо затиснути клавішу, то відбувається аналіз, а при влучному наведенні – загадка відмічається як розгадана. Усього їх 240, тому вистачить усім. У нагороду відкриються спеціальні випробування та моделі персонажів у головному меню.

Повертаючись до вражень. У ті часи я грав як є, головне, щоб був текстовий переклад, а якщо в меню не можна було змінити озвучення, то я не шукав способів зробити це інакше. Але, Asylum була після City, тому мені не вистачало тих самих голосів. А на озвучення трьох головних ролей тут узяли найкращих – голоси з мультсеріалу 1992-1995 рр, які не тільки для мене є ідеальними для своїх персонажів – Кевін Конрой у ролі Бетмена, Марк Гемміл у ролі Джокера, Арілін Соркін у ролі Гарлі Квінн. Ніякий Крістіан Бейл, Гіт Леджер, Марґо Роббі їм не рівня. Комісара Ґордона озвучує Том Кейн, який теж професіонал, але трохи не той Джим, якого голосом грав Боб Гейстінгз, проте й роль тут невелика. Відчутним мінусом є сама якість цих реплік: на тлі чіткого саундтреку, фрази звучать так, наче звук стиснено заради економії місця; гадаю десь на студії лежать оригінали, але їх ми ніколи не почуємо, якщо не випустять раптовий ремастер, як це сталося з Quake II, де нам надали можливість грати з lossless-треками.

Щодо технологічної частини, то тут усе складно. З однієї сторони гра 2009 року, тому очікувати щось не варто, але з іншої, того ж року вийшла Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, що тоді було просто «вау». Ще можна згадати м’ясну Prototype, Assassin's Creed II з деталізованим оточенням, Left 4 Dead 2 з гарними анімаціями облич, Red Faction: Guerrilla з проривною фізикою. Загалом, Бетмен погано зберігся: текстури страшнуваті, персонажі просто відкривають рот з мертвим виразом обличчя, модельки якісь трохи широкі й непропорційні, купа дверей з підвантаженням, пререндерені ролики низької якості, загальне відчуття низької частоти кадрів через анімації руху, зроблені з низьким fps, шрифти субтитрів не масштабуються після Full HD тощо. Тому рекомендую [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1159691355/][b]цей посібник[/b][/url]. 

У моєму профілі можна подивитися скріншоти як виглядатиме. Я встановлював Asylum Reborn, який іде одразу з оновленим лаунчером; AsylumHD та Asylum 4K. Що це дає? Текстури на всіх поверхнях і моделях матимуть якісний оновлений вигляд та разом з катсценами будуть у 4k. Покращений запускач дасть змогу без проблем вибрати будь-яку роздільну здатність і надасть доступ до недоступних у стандартній версії параметрів, включно з тими, які активують моди. Вбудована технологія NVIDIA PhysX працюватиме належним чином і в повну силу, що не тільки надасть фізичну модель кожному папірцю в частих стосах, але й усі цеглини чи інші предмети взіємодіятимуть з моделями: особливо круто на вулиці ходити й розкидувати листя на підлозі. Єдине місце, де всі ці покращення можуть навантажити систему, це сутичка зі Страхопудалом, де на екрані сотні маленьких об’єктів, що лікується сучасним залізом або середніми налаштуваннями PhysX.

Якщо подобається Бетмен чи якась інша гра серії Arkham – рекомендую зіграти, тим паче є гарний [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1914493673/][b]українізатор[/b][/url]. Якщо ні, то я не знаю навіщо фанат Kingdome Come читає цю рецензію. | It is a great beginning to the Arkhamverse. I loved it when I first played it on the console, and it still holds up all these years later. It's a shame that the same can't be said about Rocksteady | До цього часу не грав в жодну частину Batman. Навіть жодного ролику чи огляду не бачив.  Гра мене здивувала своєю простотою та якістю. Навіть зараз ця гра виглядає достойно. 
Світ створений в темних тонах, все в стилі DC. Легкий та зрозумілий сюжет. Доволі велика, умовно, відкрита карта. Бо в деякі місця можливо дістатися пройшовши по сюжету і отримавши нові гаджети.  
Якісно озвучені герої. Відчувається їхнє безумство та психологічний розлад.  Їхній біографічний опис повністю втілений в гру їхніми діями.  Намальовані вони також прикольно. Особливо Джокер у фінальному файті. Я прям кайфанув від його вигляду.
І так...!!!м  Самий мед, сама насолода в грі - це бойова механіка. Ти ніби створюєш музичний твір набираючи більше комбо в такт натиснутими клавішами. Кожен бій можна виграти по різному. Любиш прямий контакти - то в перед, головне вирубити першим того хто із зброєю. А можна діяти, як справжній хижак. Полювати на кожного окремо. Так круто спостерігати за панікою тих ворогів, що залишаються живими. Їхнє серцебиття частішає, уважність стає меншою і як наслідок - неминучий, тихий нокаут.
Цю гру варто спробувати тому хто в неї не грав. І можна зіграти між сесіями нинішнього конвеєрного ігро-світу. Однозначно рекомендую! | great linear cinematic game. the art direction is beautiful and the claustrophobic disturbing atmosphere of the asylum is great. plot is intriguing as it sets in a narrow period between a clearly long, filled past and questions of what could come after it.  interactive storytelling is professional as i felt like the game knew what i would think and where i would go as an impulse, numerous times. combat is fluent and enjoyable. batman's body shape is goofy af. definitely recommend it and the games came after it, the quality just gets better like a snowball with each game of the series."

 | Amazing game and out right fun with friends regardless of what happens. Why don't I recommend the game?

76561198032898393,47810,Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition,25.55,RPG,0,"After completing the fourth part of Dragon Age, I wanted to play the first part again. And God, how wonderful it is: strong characters, gorgeously written dialogues, an epic story, you just dissolve in all this. I had already forgotten that such games were once released and made.

You really get incredible pleasure from the dialogues compared to the fourth part. Dialogues here are like a separate art form, it is clear that the developers once worked hard. In general, this is not the only thing that can give you emotions, the game itself is very variable: this concerns both your backstory and your choice in certain actions, you are the creator of your story and what its outcome will be depends only on you.

Pros:
☑️🔝 An epic story with saving the world, where you are the chosen one and your decisions will determine what the ending will be, as well as a number of other important events. The right to choose, as in RPG games, is not an empty phrase here as in the finale of Mass Effect 3; 
☑️🔝 Well-written and interesting characters;
☑️🔝 Dialogues and the variability of their choices give exquisite pleasure;
☑️🔝 The ability to create a character and choose what your backstory will be;
☑️🔝 Interesting character leveling system. I found it very interesting to fight and level up my character;
☑️🔝 The atmosphere, music are top notch here;
☑️🔝 The ability to install mods.

And also many many other advantages, each of which is native and special for each person.

Even before the Steam version, I spent countless hours here, I spent many hours on certain events in the game, replayed this fantastic game many times. This game gave me so many pleasant and positive emotions that words are not enough to describe everything I feel about this game. I love the first part and consider this game the best from the BioWare studio. There was nothing better from them and perhaps there never will be. I would also add the first and second parts of Mass Effect as well as Jade Empire here. | 不敢玩龙腾2和审判，是因为不想看到那个有时天真、有时腹黑，聊起漂亮鞋子会蹦蹦跳跳，表达感情坦坦荡荡的Leliana就此身居幕后，成为主角团的引路人，关键是与灰卫再无瓜葛。也许世界观如此，所以灰卫无论如何不能有个好结局（作为男人当国王除外，因为我不可能选男主控就无视掉了），也无论如何不能与爱人长相厮守。那位有着火红头发的吟游诗人常常入我梦里，我无数次想要打开DA2的手都停了下来，我的DAO永远停在打完蕾莉安娜之歌的那个下午。当年我玩质量效应时也有这样的感情，但毕竟主角没换，两人都活着就能再见面，即使不再是队友。可是DA不一样，我无法停止害怕遇到性情大变的Leliana，也许我打开DA2的那天，是我终于停止爱她的那天吧。 | 虽然画面和手感落后，但剧情和游玩体验胜过现在很多大作。玩完以后意犹未尽，大概还因为最后主角希腊英雄般的一剑，波澜壮阔的一生，未尽之语，颠沛流离，从此不必再提

路过的薛姐：在说我吗？ | Dragon age: Origins, woah there's a game. If Skyrim is the guy in high-school all the girls wanted to date, but was really just average, and Fable was the nerdy awkward foreign exchange student all the juniors tried to bang, then where is dragon age? 

Dragon age is the 6' 8"" monstrosity of a man that fingered your girlfriend on prom night. No one expects Dragon age origins. DA is the guy that looms in the background dark and mysterious, but after hitting the showers fresh off an intense PE class, DA walks through to his locker butt-ass naked, with his full 10.3"" flaccid hog swinging freely.

That is to say, Dragon Age is bold. The game has mature subject matter dealing with death on massive scales, racism, class based societies, deception, grotesque body horror, and enough S.V.U. crime to keep Benson and Stabler employed for at least 3 lifetimes. Seriously, look at brood mothers and tell me DA didn't earn that mature rating. 

But dragon age is a complex character, just like Jack Reacher, Dragon age isn't just a brute. The game is extremely adept at exploring plot points in immersive and clever ways. Handles scenes that need finesse and understanding with expertise, and does a great job of both showing and telling the player about the world around them. But more than that, dialogue decisions and direct actions carry weight and will have repercussions later into the game. 

If you like well written and immersive RPG's that stick with you well past their run times then check out Dragon Age: Origins at your earliest convenience.

I haven't had to mess with anything to keep it stable. I think that in my ~40 hours of playing, I've only had two crashes. Much better than a lot of other old games I remember playing from CDs. And that's good, because I can easily play for hours and hours at a time, and I lose track of when and where I am. Messing around, creating the most sadistic dungeon possible, and dressing it up so it feels bonita is addictively fun and relaxing.

On the other hand, the game does have a lot of jank. There's a freeze every time it autosaves, which can interrupt what you're doing. Animations frequently mess themselves up. Combat involves a lot of random number rolls to determine attacking, dodging, etc., but it's often unclear if your attack missed or if the enemy has a mana shield or invulnerability power active. Finally, the game has a very specific (and, in 2025, old-fashioned) sense of humor. Overall, I find it charming, but I can imagine other people getting annoyed or finding it cringe. Be warned.

TL;DR: the game runs surprisingly well on modern machines, and the gameplay loop is awesome. Some good old-fashioned jank holds Dungeons back from being truly great, but it can't stop the fun. | [h1] Rating: 1/5 [/h1]

Dungeons is a game that has aged poorly. Even upon its release in 2011 it probably felt old. The engine seems unprepared to deliver the intended experience. Furthermore, the choppy flow of the game prevents some of the novel core mechanics from getting a chance to shine. The newer Dungeons games are much better, so you could play those instead. | This was a good game until they added that stupid launcher than spams your email with lots of junk each day,"

The fishcake is yummy. | This has been an insane challenge but super fair, with minor exceptions*. If you like this sort of thing, this is EXACTLY the sort of thing you'll like.

Thank you, Zachtronics, for making such an amazing game. This is not a Sudoku or Sokoban where there is exactly one perfectly-logical solution to each puzzle. Instead, each player invents their own solutions -- and some can be more efficient than others, in multiple mutually-exclusive ways. As Zach Barth said in old interviews, SpaceChem is an example of ""design-based games, which present you with a goal, perfect information, and a set of combinable tools to achieve it... they're essentially asking you to 'invent' a solution to a problem instead of merely 'finding' the solution."" This kind of creative puzzle-solving is what I had imagined a STEM PhD program would be like (though it turns out PhDs are not really mostly about this; but that's a whole other story).

And... after a decade and a half, HOLY COW I finally beat it! Without hints**! I know many others have beat it before me, but it's still satisfying to know I've done something SpaceChem's designer Zach Barth has (according to old interviews) never done himself.

WOW has this ever been a long journey. These little molecules and waldos have accompanied me like a white whale through so many life stages. When SpaceChem came out in 2011, I started playing the game and enjoyed it a ton, but I got stuck and took a break. A few years later, I picked it up again as a distraction from grad school, but only reached the 4th or 5th world out of 9 -- before taking another (loooong) break. A decade later, after getting tenure, my treat to myself was to tackle SpaceChem seriously again... and now it's finally done -- with my kids staying up late to cheer as we beat the final boss.

Looking at the Steam-friends leaderboards, I'm also amused to see where my friends apparently quit playing. The quantum-physics PhD tunneled out in the 3rd world; the Twitch data scientist stopped streaming in the 5th; the software engineer and the IT manager suffered packet loss in the 6th. Somehow, I alone persevered to traverse the desolate worlds 7 through 9. Steam says I've spent 60ish hours on the game; I'd guess around 30 hours covered the first 6 worlds and the other 30 hours covered the last 3 worlds. Many of my solutions aren't optimized and beautiful (especially Don't Fear The Reaper; holy crap I made an ugly mess there) -- but they are mine, my own inventions, my hard-fought victories.

Once again, thank you to Zach and Zachtronics.

* The minor exceptions to fairness: (1) Every non-boss level tells you exactly how many molecules you need to make, but the boss-levels don't. It can be orders of magnitude harder to devise a solution that'll use up all molecules equally and produce an unending stream of hits, vs a good-enough solution that's unbalanced but just enough to beat the boss... yet you don't know how many hits each boss will take until you beat it. Most take around 3 hits -- but not all. (2) The game doesn't seem to allow multiple save slots for a level. If I try one solution and it doesn't QUITE work and I want to try another one, I have to get rid of my first solution and start the second... and if the second fails, I can't revert back to the first. I could take a screenshot of an initial solution, then remake it from scratch later if I need to, but aaargh! This is a small but extremely frustrating flaw in the game's interaction design. HOWEVER, I didn't realize until after beating the game that there's a dev-authorized ""community edition"" beta version which DOES allow multiple save slots per level. Look it up. Argh.

** ""I beat it, without hints"": Ok, technically, for the very last 2 boss levels I eventually looked up how many hits it takes to defeat each boss. See above -- I think this is unfair imperfect information. Besides, all the earlier bosses die after around 3 hits, but these two didn't die after 3... nor after 4... so I gave in and looked it up, because there's a big difference between ""incrementally tweak my initial solution to stretch from 3 hits to 5 or 6 hits"" vs ""start again from scratch to allow for 10 or 20 or 40 hits."" But I didn't look at anyone else's solutions, merely the number of hits required. | I'm wondering why I'm playing this game, is it any different than going to github and submitting a feature? | This is a game made for people with massive brains. | bu oyun"

76561198032898393,620,Portal 2,10.75,"Action, Adventure",10,"Portal 2 is one of the best puzzle games ever created. It combines logical thinking, physics-based mechanics, and an engaging story. The game takes place in Aperture Science, a mysterious and dangerous laboratory filled with test chambers. The player controls Chell, a silent protagonist who must escape using the Portal Gun. This device allows players to create two linked portals on surfaces, making it possible to teleport and solve puzzles.

One of the most impressive aspects of Portal 2 is its level design. Each test chamber introduces new mechanics, forcing players to think creatively. The game starts with simple puzzles but gradually becomes more complex. Elements like light bridges, propulsion gel, and lasers add depth to the challenges. The difficulty curve is perfect, making the game enjoyable for both beginners and experienced players.

Portal 2 also stands out with its story and humor. The main antagonist, GLaDOS, is a sarcastic and witty AI who constantly insults and manipulates the player. Wheatley, a clumsy and funny robot, adds another layer of comedy. Their dialogues make the game more entertaining and memorable. Despite its humor, the story also explores themes of control, identity, and artificial intelligence.

Another great feature of Portal 2 is its cooperative mode. Unlike the single-player campaign, co-op requires teamwork and communication. Players control two robots, Atlas and P-Body, solving puzzles that require coordination. This mode enhances the experience, making it even more enjoyable when played with a friend.

Overall, Portal

76561198032898393,20920,The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,0.0,RPG,0,"Редкий случай: перед нами игра, которая практически полностью соответствует нашим ожиданиям. Это большая (до 20 часов только на основную сюжетную линию) RPG, предоставляющая игроку довольно широкую свободу выбора и не забывающая, что его, вообще говоря, надо развлекать. Даже гигантские боссы здесь есть, словно речь идет не об экшен/RPG, а о каком-нибудь японском слэшере вроде Bayonetta или еще не вышедшего Asura’s Wrath. Куда уж веселее. Есть, правда, сомнения, как все это воспримут люди, не знакомые с первоисточником, — но такие «Ведьмаком 2» вообще заинтересуются вряд ли. Для тех же, кто помнит еще первую встречу Геральта и Фольтеста и может без запинки десять раз повторить имя нильфгаардского императора Эмгыра вар Эмрейса, игра станет самым настоящим подарком. | ""The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings"" is a critically acclaimed RPG that builds upon the strong foundation laid by its predecessor, offering a deeper, more refined experience. Released in 2011 by CD Projekt Red, the game is set in a dark and gritty world full of political intrigue, moral ambiguity, and complex characters. It follows Geralt of Rivia, a skilled monster hunter, as he becomes entangled in a conspiracy involving the assassination of kings and the fate of the entire continent. The game’s story is rich and engaging, with choices that truly matter, allowing players to shape the narrative in meaningful ways.

One of the most striking features of ""The Witcher 2"" is its branching storyline. The game offers multiple paths depending on the choices players make, particularly during key moments. This results in different quests, character interactions, and even entire endings. The world feels alive and reactive, and the player’s decisions carry weight, making each playthrough potentially unique. This level of player agency is one of the game’s greatest strengths, as it provides a deep sense of involvement in the unfolding drama.

The combat in ""The Witcher 2"" is fast-paced and strategic. Unlike many RPGs that rely heavily on simple hack-and-slash mechanics, this game requires players to think tactically. Geralt uses a combination of swords, magic, and alchemy to defeat his enemies, and mastering each of these elements is key to surviving tougher battles. The game also features challenging boss fights that demand careful planning and quick reflexes. While it can be difficult at times, the combat feels rewarding, and successfully defeating a tough opponent provides a real sense of accomplishment.

The world-building in ""The Witcher 2"" is exceptional. The game’s settings are varied, from war-torn battlefields to lush forests, crumbling castles, and bustling cities. Each area feels unique, with its own culture, history, and lore. The attention to detail is remarkable, and the game does an excellent job of immersing players in its world. The character design is similarly impressive, with a cast of memorable individuals that are morally complex and believable. The game’s voice acting, writing, and character development all contribute to making the world feel lived-in and full of depth.

Another standout aspect of ""The Witcher 2"" is its mature and morally gray storytelling. The game doesn’t offer simple good-versus-evil narratives; instead, it explores themes of power, betrayal, and the consequences of one's actions. Many of the choices players face are morally ambiguous, and there’s no clear ""right"" or ""wrong"" answer. This makes the game feel more grounded in reality, where actions often have unintended consequences, and characters are rarely just one-dimensional.

While the game’s graphics were impressive for its time, it’s the overall atmosphere and attention to detail that truly stand out. The soundtrack enhances the experience, with a score that captures the tone of the game perfectly, whether it’s a haunting melody during a quiet moment or a fast-paced theme during combat.

""The Witcher 2"" is a game that appeals to players who enjoy a more mature and complex narrative. Its story, world-building, and choice-driven gameplay make it one of the best RPGs of its generation. It’s a game that rewards exploration and thoughtful decision-making, and it challenges players to consider the deeper consequences of their actions. With its engaging combat, morally complex characters, and immersive world, ""The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings"" remains a standout title in the RPG genre.

[b][h2]9/10[/h2] | Most people said that TW3: Wild Hunt is more enjoyable if you've played the first two games first. After doing so, that most certainly isn't the case. These felt kind of like a waste of time overall, I'd say you're good just playing the third if you're unsure of where to start. 

The main reason I went back and played the first two Witcher games was because I started a playthrough of TW3 and felt like I was so behind on the lore and characters of the universe. I kept encountering characters that the journal said Geralt had met in previous adventures until finally I decided to cut my losses 50+ hrs in and complete the first two games first before returning. 

But both stories in the first games are fairly inconsequential. TW1 is definitely unnecessary, only giving you a glimpse of who Geralt and a few of his closest friends are while pursuing a criminal organization. TW2 shows the political state of the kingdoms just before the third game, and some brief flashbacks into Geralt's forgotten past before his amnesia, but that's it. 

None of the characters I'd thought were in the first games like Ciri, Yennefer, Keira Metz, Sigismund Dijkstra, the two people burning at the stake in a certain city that the journal says Geralt knew, etc, are even in them. Okay, maybe one of the people burning at the stake is at least in TW2 but they were just a merchant near the end of the game with one line of dialogue, at least in my playthrough. They had no role in the story at all. I'm left to assume most of the story I thought I missed out on is in the books, not the earlier games.

So I gained nothing from playing this. On top of that the games were kind of boring. Dialogue was decent but even compared to the first game TW2 was disappointing. TW1 impressed me more in some ways. 

The quests felt more involved in TW1, where simply following what we were being directed to do in the journal could lead to screwing ourselves over. I often had to think, and pay attention to what someone said earlier for a clue on how to properly move forward. Nearly every time I made progress during a quest, I could chat with a character I knew who would have new dialogue for me, unlike TW2. Sometimes we could talk to a character other than the one on our objectives for a better outcome. Here everything is just straightforward, follow the next objective, no thinking required. 

Romances in TW1 felt more rewarding and the opportunities were much more numerous. I didn't even pursue them and ran into quite a few. It felt like a mini-game of its own since there were romance cards to collect. Looting also felt more important, whereas in TW2 we just get a bunch of crafting items/herbs I never even used. Most of it I just sold since I had so much with no use for it. And not being able to select the loot individually felt dumbed-down. Potions felt ineffective in TW2 and having to predict when I might need them was annoying since we could only consume them while meditating, so luckily they could be largely ignored on ""Normal"" difficulty. 

I could describe a bunch of other things that TW1 did better, but also some things in TW2 just weren't as much of a step forward as I'd expected. There weren't many choices I made in the game that I felt made a difference later down the line. The game failed to introduce a sufficient number of interesting characters throughout the story; there are very few worth remembering. Contracts were also very scarce and simplistic. The monster variety was severely lacking, mostly just Nekkers, Endregas, Harpies, and occasional Rotfiends. Gear still felt minimalistic in that it wasn't impressive-looking and there wasn't much to be found in the entire game. The variety in areas the game takes you to isn't there either, it's just 3 different locations all of which are boring: a swamp outpost, a muddy camp, and some old ruins. The game basically all happens in settlements, like the first game.

Also TW2 is a short game, only 36 hours and I took my sweet time + read all the journal/character/location/monster entries.  It's really only better than the TW1 in graphics and combat, and the TW1 wasn't a great game either. 

Both of these are like a 7/10 for me. Enjoyable enough to make it through one full playthrough, but I've no desire to ever play them again. Hopefully TW3 actually lives up to the hype, and I'll at least have some characters appear in it which will help make the time spent here worthwhile when I import my save to it.

差不多7年前，我的小学同学就发现了这款大作，那时手机版还没有心动，只有应用商店里的1.2版本，对于当时的我们，手机版1.2只有两个滑轮键控制移动和瞄准，并且局域网联机方便，十分益于上手。我和几个哥们一放假就聚在一起play。当时我们卡在世纪之花这个boss，就聚在学校小花园商量战术，没想到我自己直接单挑过了，还有我第一次打过肉山，是拿蜜蜂手雷和它同归于尽，真的很怀念1.2陪伴我的时光，之后1.2下架，国服代理，为了玩上1.3的泰拉，我在好游快爆苦苦地种玉米（当时可以以此换取游玩资格，否则就要花钱），没想到最后发现还需要早起抢购资格，而我当时可能在上学，没有抢到，努力直接白费。我和同学只能在网上寻找那些还没下架1.2的网站继续玩。
从小学到了初中，以前玩泰拉的朋友各奔东西，但我对泰拉的热情依然不减，后来出了手游国际版我便立即下载，顶着看不懂的英文，摸索1.3的机制，专家模式掉落的装备我都从未见过，新鲜感和好奇心油然而生，初中期间我也找到了一两个一起玩的，使我不至于太孤独。疫情之前，我从来都是只玩手机版泰拉，知道疫情上网课，我终于有机会玩上电脑版了。当时的我对电脑并不精通，也不知道steam是什么东西，于是就在360浏览器直接搜泰拉瑞亚，经过一天的寻找，我也是下到了盗版泰拉（当时我也不知道正版要买）就这么在电脑上再通关了一遍普通模式，但这次没有任何人陪伴，只有我一个人。
终于到了高中，我了解了正规的steam渠道，在打折期间花18块钱买了正版泰拉，为童年补了票，高二认识了几个志同道合的同学，一起玩了灾厄，也是乐在其中。如今，我即将成人，步入大学生活，但我的泰拉之旅还在继续，玩了十几年游戏，只有泰拉瑞亚给我的印象最深，给我带来的乐趣最多，对于陪伴了我78年的老伙计，打多少星已经不重要了，真没想到我能写这么多，回顾了一遍我的童年，我的眼里有些模糊。 | --{ Gráficos }---

☐ No recomendado | I have over 2k hours in this game, and I think I can safely say it's infinitely replayable and incredibly enjoyable. Great bosses, fun stat progression, sandbox building, etc. Highly recommend. | Очень классная игра. Давно играю в него спустя с мобильной версии террарии. Когда перешёл на пк версию, то было ещё веселее и приятнее. Жаль конечно что старые мобы, вещи, боссы пропали с телефонной версии, но так приятно о них вспоминать и проходить их в тмодлорде. Люблю эту игру | The game is fabulous, but a bit more handholding at the very beginning would be nice, because the moment the game started, I had no idea what I was supposed to do or how I was supposed to build anything or use my inventory, so the first few minutes were horrendous, and I was dying quite a lot, which reminded me why I instantly deleted this game many years ago when trying to play it for the very first time. This time around I decided to keep at it, and the first 10–15 hours were slow, but then I got the hang of it, and the game consumed me to the point where I lost track of time and racked up 100 hours just completing the main story and hunting for some achievements. Be prepared to keep your browser running in the background, because you are probably going be switching between the game and the Terraria Wiki quite a lot."
76561198032898393,105400,Unknown,3.716666666666667,,0,"The game plays much like Fable 2. If liked Fable 2 you will probably like this game however there are a lot of problems with the game, flaws and such to take into account too. The friendship/relationship quests are for example quite tedious and VERY  repetative...the game has a large amount of glitches, bugs and errors due to lack of effort porting it from the console. Such things as black screens, problems with compatibility on certain operating systems very unoptimized for PC GPU's. The worst offenses being GfWL which is still part of the game as of writing this and unsure about what will happen when GfWL ends at this stage. Steams GfWL is out of date for example and you have to uninstall it and go and download the latest one to even access the DLC's you purchased on Steam. The game is very easy both in terms of combat and story. For example by the time I reached the endgame battle I had over 20million gold when the battle itself only requires 6million (I won't say why as that might be too much into the spoilers factor), the ending itself was one of the bad aspects of this game too both in terms of final battle and ending sequence itself which was a big letdown.

Despite it's flaws the game itself prior to the ending and providing you can run it okay on your system regarding it's many bugs, glitches, poor optimization and compatibility problems...was quite enjoyable for the most part. Like I said it feels like Fable 2 on some ways. It may not be some people's cup of tea if they did not like Fable 2 and was hoping for more of a sequel to Fable 1 than Fable 2 but if you not one of those people you might enjoy it. I would say wait till it's on sale before picking up though, 50-75% off because the chance of having GPU, OS or other problems plus the poor optimization may leave a bitter taste in your mouth if pay full price and find runs badly or not at all on your system. The support from the developers on this title is non-existant. You will tend to need to ask other players for solutions to problems mostly with the game since feels like the developers ported the game in a way to save them the most time and effort and released it to the PC community with a big thanks for your money but don't bother us with your problems note on it.

The graphics are slightly better than the console version (providing you don't mind stuttering and such from time to time due to the poor optimization of the game for the platform), the music is good enough but can be repetative quite a lot. The VO work stands out as very good I feel, the emotion system is more difficult to use than Fable 2 and the sanctuary use can become tedious for simple tasks. The story is interesting enough but nothing amazing about it, the humor I feel was quite good though such as character banter and quests from time to time. The quick travel system is not great but adequate, took a while before realised you could quick travel to buildings not just the town but when not in towns you will end up doing a lot of running even after quick travelling to a location in order to reach place wanted to go. The dog is good in this one, though tricky to target for interactions. Also worth noting the game is more suited to gamepad than K/M.

Other things worthy of note is the Co-op is not so good with this title, it's okay if have friends who also own it and willing to follow you around but gain very little from doing so but if your friends aren't the kind who would do things for no reward then you may find yourself having to PuG some other players on the forum to help you with things. There is content in the game locked out for the player unless they use Co-op too which is a big issue for me in game design and a two fingers up to Lionhead from me for it. Such content is things like there are some demon doors in the game you can only open if someone else plays wth you etc. It is not a deal breaker for me though in that the rewards for doing that Co-op locked content has no impact on the story itself, more of a big annoyance to me that they would lock the player out of content they paid for when bought the game unless convince someone else or have someone else buy the game too in order for you to gain access to the content you already paid for.

Would I recommend this game? Sure but only if liked the direction Fable 2 was heading rather than hoping for another Fable 1 The Lost chapters and also only if you know enough about PC technical problems and solutions to work around the many problems this game has, those who struggle to solve such problems may struggle to even get this game to run but those who can might enjoy it. In the end this game damaged my opinion of Lionhead as a developer in a big way but it did not damage my love of the Fable franchise itself and I gained enough enjoyment once resolved the technical aspects to say it is worth picking up on sale provided you realise there are some large flaws and some minor ones in the game. | The Fable series are a great set of games, each one being just as different as they are similar which brings alot of negative feedback about certain ones since Fable 1 was an exceptional game. 

Fable 3 comes with alot of flaws but these flaws (in my opinion) can be fixed. For instance the game lacks alot of the colour from the former games making it feel alot more dull, this however CAN be fixed using SweetFX which there are 'guides' showing how to do this (worked for me and looks stunning now).
Also being a straight port from the xbox this game lacks alot of graphic options and the Vsync locks out at 30FPS but without Vsync the game gets some terrible screen tearing, so either way your gameplay will be ruinded if this isnt fixed, however I personally made a Guide on the steam forums on how to fix this for Nvidia users, not sure how its done on AMD sorry :(

Alot of people wont want to go through the effort of doing these things but for me... Fable is worth it, I love the series and the gameplay to me is worth the effort. The graphics are great once fixed, the storys fun and quirky and the game mechanics make Fable 3 very interactive and immersive. Well worth the buy in my opinion. 

As I post this review on the 26/11/2013 I know that alot of people are having a problem with the game as Valve/Steam have run out of CD keys for Fable 3, a specific date hasn't been given as to when the keys will be recieved but my Fiancee (one of the many on the forums suffering from this problem) has been sent an email telling her that this WILL be fixed and she will be given what she has payed for as soon as the keys are recieved by them. 
DO NOT let the negative reviews given by the people not recieving keys put you off this game, by all means wait until the forums state that keys are once again available but dont let it stop you purchasing the game in future. Its well worth the wait in my opinion.

Enjoy your gaming people and I hope this review helped! | Fable 3 e uma ótimo game de aventura, como RPG deixou muito a desejar não tendo os principais elementos básicos de um bom RPG. A história na maior parte e bem legal, porem em alguns momentos e missões são extremamente infantis e com um senso de humor péssimo. Uma das coisas mais legais e que as decisões que você toma durante o game realmente influenciam no decorrer do game e no final, mudando completamente os rumo da história. No geral e um bom jogo.

Nota 8/10 | Нечасто можно сказать такое про игру, но это - чистейшее ОКОНСОЛИВАНИЕ, из палаты мер и весов. Адовая деградация по сравнению с первой частью (во вторую не играл). Плюсов назвать не смогу, минусы перечислю по пунктам:

*Графика. Я не знаю, из какой жопы должны расти руки, чтобы графика получилась даже хуже, чем в первой части 2004 года. Вдобавок, в попытках скрыть и замазать это говно, было принято простое и ""гениальное"" решение тупо замазать картинку толстым слоем блюра, а сверу щедро приправить блумом, чтобы поверхности на солнце были похожи на охваченные пожаром. В итоге, на монитор как будто пролили растительное масло с молоком. Цветовая палитра отвратительна, напоминает второго ведьмака. В некоторых местах цвета становятся почти с нулевой насыщенностью, в некоторых - ярко-кислотными. Но, как говорится, и это еще не все, несмотря на все это, вытекает второй пункт:

*Оптимизация. Это самая шедевральная часть игры. На любом супер-компе фпс будет периодически проседать до 10-15, при этом, фрапс будет показывать те же стабильные 60 кадров. Тут добавить больше нечего.

*Интерфейс. За такое надо просто ебать раскаленной палкой до кровавых соплей. Верх безвкусицы, ""убежище"", манекены и прочее вместо обычного меню. Бескомромиссно убогое консольное дерьмище.

*Юмор. Первая часть в оригинале была достаточно серьезной, локализаторы сделали ее петросянной хуетой. Здесь же даже оригинал - сплошная стремная петросятина. Можно до посинения искать здесь настолько тонкий британский юмор, что даже создатели его не поймут, но юмор здесь как будто в передаче ""аншлаг"".

*Самокопирование. Это позор, постоянное самокопирование первой части. Когда смотришь на Сейкера, пробравшись в бандитсткий лагерь, прямо видишь в нем Твинблейда из первой части. К последней четверти игры мы отплываем на другой далекий материк... ну вы поняли, и так далее. А когда начинает массово играть музыка из первой части, хочется пустить пулю в голову разработчиков. 

*Экономика. Кроме шуток, в этой игре самая плохая экономическая система из всех, что я видел. Только здесь можно печь пироги, зарабатывая по 3600 за пирог, при этом сам пирог в магазине стоит 25. Можно поработать пирожником 10 минут, скупить два самых дорогих дома в игре, и за их счет весь материк может впоследствии не платить за аренду домов вообще. Деньги здесь бесконечные, и тратить их просто некуда, они не нужны. По этой причине, неплохая задумка после становления королем, с непопулярными экономическими мерами ради пополнения казны, полностью провалилась и лишена всякого смысла.

*Логика. Ее нет. Здесь можно завоевать расположение целого города, просто пернув каждому жителю под нос. Штаб сопротивления, благодаря которому герой становится королем, спустя полгода после начала правления все равно базируется в канализации. Здесь оживших мертвецов при каждой пробежке по кладбищу в пять раз больше, чем могил на всем кладбище. Нам заливают, что героев в мире не осталось и магия исчезла, но начиная со второй половины игры, каждый главарь любой стаи бандитов лихо метает огонь из рук, а вожаки нежити метают молнию.

*Упрощения. Умереть здесь нельзя. Вообще. Мана бесконечная. Заклинаний всего шесть. Оружие здесь почти не различается и выпадает рандомно (найти можно только половину из 50, остальные надо выменивать в коопе). Демонические двери деградировали настолько, насколько это возможно - их всего штук шесть, они дают денегеративные задания, а за ними в большинстве случаев хранится либо опыт, либо вообще деньги, которые и без того бесконечные.


*ИТОГО: унылая консольная аркада, искуственно растянутая бесконечными долгими побегушками, без намека на логичность, лишенная сказочной атмосферы, с петросяньим юмором, и жалкий клон первой части, которую всюду и пытается копировать.

3/10 | I've played the game for about a week and it was fun, but then it crashed. The simple crash of the game wiped the savegames and I would have to start again. And that when I was near the end of the game. Not really in the mood to restart, perhaps it's possible to make a manual backup of the save game directory so when the worst happens it might be possible to restore it. So in short, fun game, bit dated console port though and a bad bug.

PS. It is possible to restore manual saves, but it's a pain none the less. (Mine was 2 days old, but at least I won't have to replay everything.)

It's a very challenging game, even frustrating at times, as it can feel almost impossible (some of the final bosses are really tough, and you really need to memorize their attack patterns), but it's a really great game if you take your time to learn it. The art-style is grotesque, and the atmosphere is oppressing, but these things combined work well with the somewhat bleak world and characters. Given the game's roguelike nature, RNG can sometimes fuck you big time, and some runs kind of feel doomed from the start; other times you get fucked towards the end, but there's always something new to find or to unlock, so no run feels completely wasted. My only real complaint with this version is that at times the performance is kinda shit as the game lags/feels unresponsive at times (maybe because it was made in Flash, not really sure), and you can die due to stuff out of your control.

Still, The Binding of Isaac's a classic and really worth the price. | playing this game on the school computers on a browser was so fun, would recommend if you like the classic NES Zelda game | 8/10 O jogo é muito bom, leve e divertido para passar o tempo. A única razão pela qual não posso dar uma nota de 10 é porque a platina é incrivelmente difícil.

76561198032898393,24240,PAYDAY™ The Heist,8.616666666666667,Action,5,"Despite playing the sequel and then the third game first, this is by far the definitive Payday experience for me. The heists are spectacular and feel very different in tone and gameplay compared to the rest. In this game you feel as though your actually completing a hard but fun heist, whereas in the others it's a lot of chaos and power fantasy shenanigans with some heists in the other games appearing more as a after thought. Even the ui and hud for example looks much cooler and unique. The weapons are great with them being more distinct and feeling more rewarding to use as they level up and change in their performance and look, they also just feel great to use with them having some amazing sound design. Speaking of which the music for this game is as you can expect from the Payday series absolutely amazing to listen too. But at least for this game the music not only sticks better with the theme of the game but never gets tiring to listen to. As these heists can take quite a long time but the music always manages to slap and help build up to the tension and feel of each and every heist. Now onto the special units, which actually feel special and a challenge. Even normal cops and bank guards actually feel memorable rather than just boring cannon fodder all the time. The skill tree system is very rewarding and the dialogue and interactions between each heister are very engaging and immersive to the experience Payday The Heist offers. Meaning that which ever heister you pick actually makes you feel like you picked a different and fun character to play as, since the masks you wear in this game tie to which heister your playing as except for a few exceptions. Oh right speaking of which how could I forget about one of the best inclusions of this series, the masks. Now the masks of this game actually fit the vibe the game is going with and they look fantastic, plus they feel rewarding to get some of them as playing through more of the game and it's difficulties will reward you with for instance the golden and ex presidents masks which are incredible and fulfilling to get, with the added touch of them being displayed on your hud being the icing on the cake. My only problem is that I wish there was more content as there is more care and passion in this game. But sadly the sequel was made very shortly after and I wish people would acknowledge and play the original game more. Overall if you find this game I think it's worth a shot especially if it's on sale, so that you can get your Payday too. | Honestly, while I don't have NEAR as many hours in this as PAYDAY 2, the style and feel is completely different and I gotta say, I kinda like it. Still better than PAYDAY 3 at least. | First few hours of this game, I thoroughly enjoyed those 2 hours in PAYDAY: The Heist. The graphics although dated, is charming, the gameplay, although also dated, is also charming, this game, no matter how old this game is, I still think its really charming and entertaining. | Comparing it to the latest release in the PAYDAY franchise, I can certainly say that this is a better experience than PAYDAY 3 for a plethora of reasons. One being the 'completeness' of the game. This game has stood the test of time and still is quite fun to play. The atmosphere of the game feels much darker than its successors and it embraces that feeling to give it the authentic heisting feel. The characters have an abundance of interactions with the heist itself such as commenting that the Bank Manager isn't here or there. The system to upgrade your specialty takes some getting used to but it works. The enemies are a whole lot more challenging to face compared to their Payday 2 and Payday 3 variants and Payday The Heist demands more cover utilization and planning to succeed. Of course, the soundtrack is always amazing. | 挺好玩的 就是玩仁慈医院枪林弹雨难度 感觉全世界警察都跑过来就为了那份样本"
76561198032898393,102600,Orcs Must Die!,8.216666666666667,"Action, Indie, Strategy",2,"Интересный представитель жанра, но для первого знакомства не рекомендую.
Контента не очень много, если сравнивать со среднестатистическими конкурентами, вроде ""Plants vs. Zombies"", ""Defender's Quest"" и даже ""Space Run"". И я сравниваю именно с играми в жанре башенной защиты, хотя это не точное сравнение, ведь ""Orcs Must Die!"" скорее боевик от третьего лица.
Оценивать игру в сравнении с другими похожими не хочется, потому что они будут иметь, очевидно, похожие недостатки. А оценивать в вакууме, в отрыве ото всех игр вообще - тоже, потому что персонаж там уже изолирован на небольших аренах, как в серии Painkiller.
Баги портят общее впечатление - от проваливающихся в текстуры врагов до люстр, замирающих при падении в баррикадах. Был даже баг, когда началась новая волна, хотя у прежней всё ещё был живой и здравствующий гоблин-шаман.
Поиск пути у врагов периодами выдаёт финты и заставляет застревать в самых неожиданных местах.
Баланс тоже далёк от творческой свободы - при кажущемся обилии ловушек, оружия, стражей и улучшений, у них не так много гибкости при размещении, и синергии между всем этим обилием очень мало.

Основной шарм в юморе и динамике, в постоянном давлении со стороны противника, а также в относительной свежести подхода на период выхода игры. Однако основная идея всех игр жанра Tower Defense в том, что игрок доминирует над положением и выстраивает большей частью автономную защиту, тогда как эта игра ближе к боевику, учитывая количество урона, которое должен наносить сам главный персонаж, бегая по арене, и возможностей выстроить автономную защиту здесь нет. Если же сравнивать игру с другими боевиками, то эта постоянная изоляция делает её очень скудной и однообразной.
Ярым поклонникам жанра, конечно же, лучше ознакомиться; тем более, если на всю серию уже регулярны высокие скидки от 80% и более. | Como la mayoría, habrán jugado este juego en versión pirata sin completar el juego. Ahora que lo tengo acá y lo completé, pues si valió la pena. (Consejo: mejora si o si a los guardianes, me lo agradeceras). | Es entretenido, aunque se le notan mucho los años y que fue la base para esta saga. El 2 es bastante mejor a pesar de no tener mucha diferencia entre entregas, y además tiene cooperativo (cosa que el primero no tiene) así que recomendaría jugar a este solo si tienes curiosidad por como fue el primero. | 童年经典塔防游戏了，自己是从二代跟基友联机开始入坑的，现在正版补票，只可惜这代只能单人游玩。 | I'm not super great at this game, and though I wanted to play more of it I just didn't have the time it takes to put into it. That said, I think it's pretty well made and does everything you'd want it to for this type of tower defense game. I really hope someday I can get back to it and really get into this series."

Les graphismes ne sont pas mauvais, pas plus que le bestiaire, mais il manque deux composantes essentielles qui rendaient Serious Sam unique :

Premièrement, il n’y a plus du tout de voyage dans le temps. L’histoire est une préquelle, dans laquelle Sam Stone doit utiliser la machine à voyager dans le temps qui l’emmènera dans l’Égypte antique, là où se déroule le premier épisode. Plus de dépaysement tel que les trois jeux précédents nous avaient présentés. On erre dans un Caire contemporain sinistré comme une zone de guerre.

Deuxièmement, le principe des hordes d’ennemis n’est plus aussi « énorme » que dans les autres épisodes. J’ai définitivement arrêté quand je me suis retrouvé dans des ruelles étroites avec des ennemis qui apparaissaient systématiquement dans mon dos pour me tirer dessus. Finis les grands espaces farcis de caisses de munitions.

En bref, ce jeu est sérieusement raté. Espérons que les programmeurs sachent se rattraper."

Macht richtig Spaß und ist wer grafisch nicht die höchsten Ansprüche hat eine nette Alternative zu diversen anderen Spielen dieser Art. | Fantastic gameplay, classes and replayability! Controls are smooth and what a joy to play this! A decent game for its time with captivating npcs and quests.

 | Щоб пограти в неї в кооперативі (чим ми й займалися), довелося встановлювати сторонній софт, аби гра хоча б через LAN могла підключатися. Це зайняло багато часу на розв’язання проблем і працювало не дуже стабільно, але пройти гру було можливо — що ми й зробили.

У цілому, суть гри зводиться до одноманітного знищення мобів і босів та лутінгу. І якщо з останнім усе чудово — гра пропонує багато цікавих предметів і можливостей для їх покращення — то баланс у боях на рівні майстер залишає бажати кращого. Спочатку проходиш гру комфортно, без особливих труднощів, а потім  раптово зустрічаєш рівень, або боса, який буквально вичавлює з тебе всі наявні ресурси. Можливо, на нижчих рівнях складності баланс кращий, а може, навпаки, занадто легкий — не знаю.

Сюжет цілком нормальний для такого жанру, графіка хороша, анімації скілів чудові, та й у цілому прокачування кожного персонажа цікаве. Але гра різко обривається, хоча за предметами та розвитком персонажа було відчуття, що вона має тривати хоча б до 70-го рівня. Хотілося більше часу на прокачування, а не просто проходити те саме вдруге, як пропонує гра.

Загалом, класно, що розробники створили щось нове, самостійне й не схоже на інші всесвіти, але реалізація вийшла трохи сируватою — чогось не вистачає, а щось, навпаки, варто було б доопрацювати. | Accessible, Fun, has mods to add complexity, and I could run it on a toaster.

76561198032898393,104900,ORION: Prelude,1.85,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG",9,"This is the cheapest way to have a blast on steam and its great when you have no internet because you can still play you defend a generator in ever increasing in difficulty dino waves with weapons you unlock yes there are vehicles like tanks bot and chopper and even a speed cycle | Rating: 6/10

Overview: ORION: Prelude is a first-person shooter and survival game developed by Spiral Game Studios. Set in a sci-fi universe, the game offers players the chance to fight off waves of enemies, mine for resources, and explore alien landscapes. As the ""Prelude"" in the title suggests, this is part of a larger series that focuses on cooperative survival and exploration. Players can engage in solo or multiplayer modes, with the game offering various environments and enemies to battle.

Gameplay: At its core, ORION: Prelude is a mix of survival, exploration, and action. The game features dynamic combat, where players fight off hordes of enemies with a variety of weapons and tools. Players can also mine resources to improve their weapons, build turrets, and upgrade their defenses.

The game supports both solo and multiplayer modes, with the co-op experience being a major highlight. In multiplayer, players can team up to face increasingly difficult waves of enemies. This cooperative play adds a layer of strategy, as players need to work together to survive the onslaught.

The combat itself is relatively standard for a first-person shooter, with a variety of weapons available, including guns, explosives, and melee tools. However, the AI can sometimes feel lackluster, and the enemy design doesn’t offer much variety or challenge in the long run.

Graphics and Performance: ORION: Prelude features fairly basic graphics for a modern first-person shooter. The environments are passable but not particularly impressive, with alien landscapes that can feel repetitive. The textures and character models are simple, and while they’re functional, they don't stand out visually. The game’s visual style is somewhat dated, even by the standards of games released around its time.

In terms of performance, ORION: Prelude runs decently on most systems, but it can struggle with optimization at times. Some players report frame rate drops or occasional stuttering, especially in more intense combat scenarios or when there are many enemies on screen. While the game isn't demanding on hardware, the performance can still be inconsistent, which may detract from the experience.

Audio Design: The audio in ORION: Prelude is serviceable but not remarkable. The sound effects for weapons, explosions, and enemies are decent but don’t have a strong impact. The soundtrack is fairly generic, with ambient sci-fi tunes that don’t add much to the atmosphere. While the audio isn't distracting, it doesn’t elevate the experience either. There’s no significant voice acting, which could have added personality and immersion to the game’s characters and story.

Challenges: ORION: Prelude offers a moderate challenge, especially in survival mode. As players progress through waves of enemies, the difficulty increases, requiring players to manage resources, defend positions, and upgrade their gear. However, the lack of diverse enemy types or complex AI behavior can make the game feel repetitive over time.

The game can become quite grindy, as players need to farm resources, mine, and continuously upgrade their weapons and defenses. While this can be fun for a while, it may begin to feel monotonous, especially if playing solo.

Final Thoughts: ORION: Prelude is an ambitious, yet somewhat flawed, survival shooter. While the cooperative gameplay and resource management offer some fun, the overall experience can feel repetitive and lacks the depth needed to keep players fully engaged. The game’s dated graphics, lack of enemy variety, and inconsistent performance hold it back from being a standout title in the genre.

Pros:

Fun cooperative multiplayer with friends
Resource management and upgrading add strategic elements
Some decent combat mechanics
Fairly easy to jump into for casual play
Cons:

Dated graphics and repetitive environments
Weak AI and lackluster enemy variety
Performance issues, including frame drops and stuttering
Lack of story or deep character development
Can become grindy and repetitive over time
ORION: Prelude offers a decent co-op survival experience but struggles to stand out in the crowded first-person shooter market. It’s enjoyable for short sessions with friends, but the lack of long-term depth and technical issues may prevent it from becoming a lasting favorite. | Worth every penny.

The suits interaction got better, graphics are very nice and neat, the FULL AUDIO that now characters actually speak! This is really something new and feels really nice.

The collectibles of course are still there, however the way you access and interact with missions selection got even changed. You feel more entertained.

After finishing the main campaign, I can say that the level design is slightly better than the first part, it feels more complex and like it has some improvements, because you now have combination of suits, and can do more with one character.

The amount of grind you would need to actually get the 100% here is quite bjg, if we at least take the Golden Bricks.

I think you really need like 30 hours to get that 100% but if you like LEGO and etc., you should even enjoy it. I personally get frustrated from this so I will not do it.

Overall the game feels really better than the first one, and I have a fresh mind on both of them, so I can assure you that. (Also the game got a bit funnier because of the actual dialogues of the characters)

Also worth mentioning that the final battle is really ""meh"", and the ""DC Super Heroes"" just appear in the last 2 levels, if not considering Superman. | Uma grande evolução para os jogos Lego, trazendo muitas inovações para a franquia, mas ainda com problemas que atrapalham muito a jogatina, como a mecânica de voo.

This game is unapproachable for new and returning players, as the bots do not offer a significant challenge and matchmaking lobbies are filled with players who have simply been playing the game longer than you. There is no skilled matchmaking, so picking up and learning this game is just not worth the mental effort.

Sadly, Atari won't be able to revive a game reliant on its online, when new player hostility is this bad.

Great game.

In the case of Borderlands 2 developer Gearbox has decided to largely stick with what worked the first time around, while implementing a host of tweaks that make it an overall superior game. A few relatively minor complaints aside, Borderlands 2 improves not only the narrative, but almost every major game system. If you’ve been itching for a reason to jump back into the world of Pandora, Borderlands 2 provides a more than ample supply.The hook of Borderlands 2, the very reason that I found myself thinking about it when I worked or tried to fall asleep, is the loot.

Just like Diablo or a number of other action RPGs, the hunt for loot becomes intoxicating because of the tiny rush you get each time a rare colored item spills out of a chest or is dropped by a recently slain enemy. Every firefight and intense boss battle becomes all the more rewarding, because, though you might die a few times and want to crush something near you in real life, it suddenly feels like everything is going to be OK when you’re blasting away enemies with a newly looted gun. | só tem gente perturbada, armas, violência, animais perigosos, uma milicia que quer controlar tudo, nenhum policial á vista e um ambiente inóspito a vida humana.

I saw this game on a super sale and never had the thought on my mind to get this when it came out when it first released, and super glad that did. The game doesn't say a single word just noises from the characters, the game is mainly a button masher with combo keys to defeat your enemies that you come across by yourself, or with your friends. The game is however having a shelf life of over a decade to strike your opponent you have to perfectly in line with them to land a hit on them. You are able to battle your friends near the end of some of the missions to see who can get the princess. Which I think is really interesting idea because it incorporates testing your skills against your team mates on whether or not you are carrying them through out the game, to see if they can match up to you on your level and compete against them while playing with them to defeat the missions.
The only issue that I do see in this game if you are playing this on PC that you have to make sure that you join while you are out of game and someone invites you while they are in game, and by launching it from the invite window, or you will be counted as two players, one counting as the keyboard, and the other counting as your controller.

In my opinion, this is a really fun and enjoyable game that you can play with yourself or your friends that you are on with. I got this game on a super sale, and even thought that this game is fun and enjoyable to play on. I do highly recommend this game to be bought on a sale due to the shelf life that this game has and how long that this has been out for. | 游戏总体上，8/10分，优秀
抱着为童年买票还是和朋友战斗爽，都很合适。美式无厘头的画风很搞，战斗也主打一个有手就行，可收集内容也足够充足，而且如果只是想要体验一遍全流程的话，4~6小时即可，当然建议多周目联机游玩。
但是缺点也很明显，敌人种类单一，比玩家还苟的纯读指令BOSS，明显在拖延游戏时间的关卡设计，并且没有人性化设计的存档机制，但就整体来说，不是很影响游戏的游玩，尤其作为多人游戏时，还是推荐的。 | 个人评分：8/10

 | Orcs Must Die! 2 – це продовження першої частини, яке додає ще більше битв з орками та динамічного геймплею. Найбільша перевага – можливість грати вдвох, разом планувати розташування пасток і захищати замок від хвиль ворогів. Також стало більше варіантів покращення пасток, що дозволяє експериментувати та створювати власні стратегії.

Проте є й недоліки. Графіка здається гіршою, ніж у першій частині – менш чітка, з дещо розмитими текстурами. Рухи персонажів і керування теж поступаються оригіналу, але це не заважає насолоджуватися грою, особливо в кооперативному режимі. Шкода, що немає української мови, хоча англійський текст і озвучка досить вдалі та додають грі атмосфери.

Загалом Orcs Must Die! 2 – чудове продовження з цікавими покращеннями, більшими рівнями та динамічним ігровим процесом. Незважаючи на деякі недоліки, гра захоплює й добре підійде тим, хто любить поєднання стратегії та екшену. (А ще вбивати орків.) | noice shooter / tower defense hybrid I know.

You have an array of cool weapons to unlock, and ditto traps. You're also totally free to choose a playstyle. If you don't want to rely heavily on traps, you can go with projectile or melee weapons, or you can go full no-touch mastermind and use only traps and maneuvering, this is left up to you in the most organic way possible - you just pick the equipment you prefeer at the start of the round and that's it.

I remember watching jacksepticeye playing it back in the day... Brought me a lot of nostalgia.
There's a pretty big item/description variety, but as this game is intended for kids there aren't any edgy/""NSFW"" thing in the game, which could add a crap ton of comedic value to the gameplay.
On a big sale it's pretty cheap, so it's not a ""commitment"". Replayability is not very good though, as the situations, characters, etc are all the same and there are a finite and low number of ways to complete the quests.
7/10 | It's a decent game but it's missing a lot of QOL that it desperately needs.
It doesn't support windowed fullscreen, your only options are exclusive fullscreen or windowed.
When in windowed mode, you can't resize the window manually and resolution options are very limited.
There's no way to skip the tutorial section.
There's no way to skip most of the cutscenes, such as the ones that happen before every single starite mission, or the ones at the start of each new area, or the one after you die...

The gameplay is alright, but there's too many shards that boil down to ""guy is hungry/bored/sick, give him a sandwich/book/doctor"".

11/10 can recommend | Tropico 4 is a highly entertaining economic simulation. While it’s no longer a new game and the graphics are somewhat dated, the addictive gameplay remains as strong as ever, even though the missions can be a bit repetitive at times.

[h2]Achievements[/h2]
[b]Required time:[/b] 70-100 hours
[b]Difficulty (in my opinion):[/b] 4 out of 10
[b]DLCs required for 100%?:[/b] Yes, 1 (Modern Times)

Earning achievements is enjoyable despite the repetitiveness. Essentially, you’ll need to complete all the campaign missions and the Modern Times DLC missions, which will take up the majority of your time. For those who prefer shortcuts, cheats can be used to skip a few missions, saving significant time - but where’s the fun in that? Apart from that, there’s a long list of other achievements, most of which can be earned during the campaign. A bit of sandbox play is also required, along with tackling a very grindy achievement, although there are easy solutions available for that one as well. | they should kept more things from this version.

Could it be improved upon? Of course, but Tropico 5, unfortunately, did not improve upon it. In fact, Tropico 5 was far worse. I came back to Tropico 4. It oozes charm with it's wacky characters, it allows chaos by not requiring you to build roads, and the military system actually made sense. If you want to truly experience the Tropico series at its best, play Tropico, Tropico 3, and finally, Tropico 4. | An absolutely addicting game of strategy, manipulation, thinking-ahead, and improvisation. The scenarios can keep you entertained for hundreds of hours (as evidenced by my numbers, and I still have some scenarios to clear) and provide meaningful differences in every play that keeps the game feeling fresh.

2/18/2017 Edit: Some of my outfit/platoon mates gave me some ideas as to what to put for the 10 things as I could only think of about 4 on my own :P 
So thanks to them to make this review entirely possible!

3/1/2017 Edit 2: a few more tips for you are   
1) dont run infront of your allies that are shooting, go behind them so you stay out of their line of fire.   
2) use the terain around you for cover.  
3) if your a Heavy Assault turn you shield on when entering cover, even if your not being shot at. reason is this is a CLIENT side game if you can see them, you can shoot them. so if your in cover they may still see you out of cover for a short time after because they havent recieved the info from you yet. so use the addage of ""I can see you, I can shoot you"" the same goes for the other players aswell   
4) Don't go straight for the enemy UNLESS you have several teamates with you. Try your BEST to FLANK the enemy. don't attack them head on. come at them from the sides, above, or even behind them, if one tactic dosen't work... Try something else. the fight is dynamic, just like you!  5) Finally, LEARN the strengths and weaknesses of your weapons, it WILL take time.


P.S. Feel free to add my on steam or PS2 (ingame) the name i listed is my primary although if you want i can tell you the others via PM or steam chat.

P.P.S. I added some tips my teamates and friends gave me. some others on Youtube, like Wrel (Dev) Nico101, Joshino, and others have also said some of these tips. If you want to know more about the game look them up on youtube Especially Wrel, as he's a developer. Nico101 I'd recoment to Older audiences, as there is some ""Humor"" that younger audiences may find offensive or dont understand. (he and his team swear a bit aswell) i do squad ops with them and its mostly moments of WTF?! and general fun. Joshino and Wrel are a great choice to see if you want to Learn more about the game, its mechanics and also for general info/guides for weapons or tactics. 

Now all this is simply my PERSONAL opinion, while i agree that some others may not agree with me, i hold my opinions of the game and the players in fair judgment.

      Planetside 2 is an online tactical shooter in which you choose to be a soldier in one of three different factions that are involved in an eternal struggle for various planets. Each faction must capture control points in order to gain control of the planet. There are 6 different soldier classes which allow for large differences in personal gameplay. Give it a try because it is free.

Epic, unique, one of a kind. It's 2017 and still no game like this one.
A war, vast worlds, playground, massive battles (and also opposite), variety, tactical, outstanding.
A war, free2play but no child's playground.
Well in a chaotic massive battle everyone could find his role and spot......
Teamwork, lone wolf, support, scout, infiltrator, cloaked bugger, jetpack flank warrior, mechwarrior, tank force, air force, gatherer...
Unforgiving, complex and overcomplicated.
Outstanding deep ballistics.

Very very slow progress to unlock this and upgrade that, add these and fully uncap those. 
Grind or die, grind to win, play or pay. 
Anyway time is money. Free2play can turn into the most expensive game by far, by far. No respecs, no refunds.
Brainer. One way or another?
Yea, teamwork, leadership and tactics, that's what matters, 
well you will be facing the most equipped warriors and platoons over n over, also you will be swarmed...,
and well the factions and powers are kinda unbalanced and varied on purpose here and there, 
so you will be facing some OP sh1t over n over. A war.
Well yea mostly everything has a downside. Challenge, outsmart, tactics.
One faction population decrease, the faction can be outnumbered. A swarm. Depending on server, can happen often.
Limited numbers, sometimes queues to one world. At least playing underpopulated faction kinda prevents you from queues. Membership has priority. 

#Honorable mentions#
CPU demanding (average GPU is enough).
Dont expect 120+++ FPS, stable FPS
Beside ingame, you can edit config file for performance, visual clarity, FOV, etc.

76561198032898393,238960,Path of Exile,0.0,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Free To Play",0,"Path of Exile (POE) não é um MMORPG, como a maioria o classifica. POE é, na verdade, um action-RPG online. Você não tem necessariamente que interagir com outros jogadores se não o quiser, e mesmo que o queira, sua interação é limitada apenas a um chat global e a alguns poucos (5) jogadores que você, por ventura, permita que entrem em sua equipe (party).

Considerado o sucessor verdadeiro do Diablo II pelos mais saudosistas, Path of Exile é um jogo bastante interessante para quem gosta de RPGs hack-and-slash com uma grande gama de possibilidades em suas builds. Com uma árvore de habilidades de mais de 1300 pontos diferentes além de um complexo sistema de crafting, cada personagem torna-se único em seu potencial, apesar de, no momento, não ter tantas possibilidades de customização visual.

Após mais de 4000 horas jogadas, sinto-me confiante que posso dar o verdadeiro valor ao jogo nessa análise sem, no entanto, deixar de considerar seus pontos fracos. Por isso, vamos por partes:

[h1]Conceito e Existência[/h1]
Path of Exile é um jogo que foi desenvolvido desde seu início para dar aos saudosistas jogadores de Diablo II um ar de renovação. Chris Wilson, o líder do projeto, e seus companheiros fundaram uma empresa chamada Grinding Gear Games, a atual responsável pelo gerenciamento do jogo, e decidiram dedicar-se exclusivamente ao desenvolvimento de POE.

Seguindo o modelo original de Diablo II, o Path of Exile tem point-of-view semelhante, embora com gráficos melhores e atualizados para uma nova geração (inclusive, recentemente, recebendo suporte a DirectX 11 e algumas funcionalidades exclusivas deste), além de conter o mesmo 'feeling' de grinding que tanto tornou Diablo II famoso.

[h1]Jogabilidade[/h1]
Com uma árvore de habilidades de mais de 1300 opções, além de 6 raças iniciais, POE tem uma jogabilidade altamente imersível e de grande liberdade aos jogadores. Ao criar um personagem, você tem uma série de quests que devem ser seguidas sob uma história modelo, dividida em dez atos e em duas partes. Ao finalizar a primeira parte da história, você parte para a segunda, com uma dificuldade maior, já que você recebe algumas penalidades.

Terminada a parte da história e com seu personagem por volta do level 60 (level 100 sendo o máximo), você parte então para o conteúdo end-game do jogo, que consiste, na maior parte do tempo, 'rodar' mapas (mais de 100 tipos diferentes) em dificuldades diferentes em busca de mais level e/ou itens raros e ajudar Zana, uma NPC, na guerra do atlas. É aí que o grinding se torna interessante para pessoas que gostam (como eu). Para as que não gostam, você pode simplesmente começar de novo se quiser e tentar novas e divertidas builds.

Para se ter uma ideia dos níveis de grinding do jogo, estima-se que a possibilidade de dropar um dos itens mais raros do jogo (Espelho de Kalandra) seja de uma vez a cada dez anos se você jogar cerca de 4 horas por dia. É bastante, de fato, mas seu alto valor no jogo faz com que todos sonhem com a possibilidade de tornarem-se ricos da noite pro dia.

Os servidores são divididos em ligas. Há a liga permanente softcore e a permanente hardcore. A diferença entre uma e outra consiste no fato de que, se você morrer com seu personagem na liga hardcore, ele será automaticamente transferido para a liga softcore (ao contrário de Diablo, onde você perde o personagem).

Há também as ligas temporárias, normalmente lançadas a cada 2 ou 3 meses. Elas oferecem um ""fresh start"", ou seja, um início fresco para aqueles que não querem se submeter à inflacionada economia das ligas permanentes ou simplesmente desejam tentar se perpetuarem como ricos comerciantes ou crafters de itens nas novas ligas. Note que, ao final de cada liga, seus personagens lá localizados, bem como o baú da sua conta, serão transferidos para as ligas permanentes.

[h1]Gráficos[/h1]
Além do que pode se ver nas próprias imagens, Path of Exile não é um jogo que possa se dizer ser muito voltado ao desenvolvimento de belos gráficos. Os gráficos são sim medianos, mas mantém-se sempre atualizados com o que há de moderno no mundo dos jogos. Há cerca de um ano, como já mencionado, o jogo recebeu suporte a DirectX 11, além de alguns efeitos especiais a mais (como o movimento responsivo de capas e asas de personagens a skills ou até mesmo o vento). Na mesma época o jogo também recebeu portabilidade para o Xbox.

Sua customização visual também não é muito rica (por enquanto), sendo você, na maior parte do tempo, obrigado a ficar preso ao visual de seus itens e de sua raça (não há diferença de sexos, por exemplo - se você escolher raça X onde o personagem é, por padrão, feminino, ele continuará sendo feminino). Toda e qualquer customização visual não padrão, ou seja, que não é próprio do item que você esteja usando, é paga. A única exceção são as recompensas fornecidas no final de cada liga. Apesar disso, no último ano, a GGG tem investido bastante nesse quesito, com uma notável melhora.

O jogo tem atenção exclusiva da Grinding Gear Games, sua empresa gerenciadora. Com um início difícil de 5 funcionários, ela hoje conta com mais de 150 pessoas em dedicação exclusiva, fazendo com que seu suporte seja um dos mais efetivos que eu já tenha visto (enviei cerca de 10 a 15 tickets e a média de tempo para resposta deles foi de 5 minutos - é incrível).

[h1]Comunidade[/h1]
Você pode escolher interagir com a comunidade ou não. Esse é o principal fator que faz com que Path of Exile não seja, per-se, um MMORPG, onde, por definição, você é obrigado a interagir com um universo de jogadores. No geral, a comunidade de Path of Exile é bastante amigável e disposta a ajudar, mas, como em todo jogo, há bastantes trolls e, principalmente, scammers.

O [i]scam[/i] é legalizado no jogo desde que não seja através de transações da vida real (ou RMT - do inglês, [i]real money trading[/i]). De acordo com o próprio Chris Wilson, a empresa tenta não realizar nenhum tipo de regulação do mercado dentro do jogo, logo cabe a cada jogador tomar conta de seus itens e analisar seu devido valor antes de se desfazer dele para outro jogador. Ainda segundo ele, no jogo, [i]'knowledge is power, and power is everything'[/i] (conhecimento é poder, e poder é tudo).

No começo, não foram poucas as vezes que fui enganado por jogadores mais experientes, comprando a preço de banana mercadorias que poderiam valer bem mais caso eu soubesse seu devido valor, por isso recomendo cautela a jogadores novatos.

[h1]Pay-to-win?[/h1]
[b]Não.[/b] Não há sequer um fator que possa ser considerado pay-to-win em todo o jogo. Tudo que é adquirido por dinheiro real é por mero conceito de embelezamento e/ou [i]status quo[/i]. O único fator que possa ser considerado pay-to-win para alguns jogadores (eu não considero, no entanto) é o fato de que, ao criar uma nova conta, você recebe gratuitamente 3 abas no baú e para adquirir mais abas você deve dispor de dinheiro real.

No entanto, é bem comum o conceito de [i]mules[/i] no jogo, onde você cria vários personagens (você pode criar mais de 20 ao todo) para guardar itens dentro de seus inventários, o que não faz com que seja um fator limitante aos jogadores que não desejam pagar por conteúdo dentro do jogo.

[h1]Conclusão[/h1]
Path of Exile é uma obra-prima dos action-RPGs onlines. Sem dúvida o melhor do gênero, com a melhor companhia de jogos existente da atualidade em sua direção, mas eu, obviamente, sou suspeito a falar, já que ""desperdicei"" (e com orgulho) mais de 3000 horas da minha vida no jogo. Se você gosta de jogos com bastante [i]grinding[/i] e com uma grande gama de possibilidades de ações, sugiro que teste Path of Exile.

[h1]Nota: 9.5/10[/h1]
Pontos positivos:
[+] Grinding complexo
[+] Grande gama de possibilidades
[+] Árvore de habilidades com mais de 1300 opções

Pontos negativos:
[-] Baixa gama de customização visual (mas que tem melhorado no último ano) | Yoa so nach knapp 4k std. Spielzeit kann ich wohl mal ein Review verfassen :P.

F2P oder P2W ? => Es ist wirklich F2P, man kann alle Charaktäre Fähigkeiten etc verwenden und ausspielen, es gibt kein EXP Boost oder ähnliches.

Wie finanziert sich die Firma hinter dem Spiel ? => MTX ähnlich wie in Dota gibt es Armor, Waffen und Fähigkeits ""Skins"" welche das Spiel selber aber nicht beeinflussen. 

Also muss man kein Geld ausgeben ? 
=> Jaein xD, wenn man sehr viel spielt und einem das Spiel nun wirklich gefällt sollte man seinen Stash(Truhe) erweitern, hier nimmt man dann mal 20€ in die Hand (wenn dir dieses Spiel keine 20€ wert ist dann lass es halt ^^), für dieses Spiel allerdings noch zu wenig bei dem was es dir bietet. 
Ich persönlich spiel das Spiel seit der closed Beta(2013) und habe zu jedem kostenlosen DLC ( ein DLC bietet ca so viel Umfang wie Diablo III insgesamt, es gibt bereits 5 DLC´s) der Firma GrindingGearGames etwas Geld zukommen lassen und hab mir davon Stash Erweiterungen und Skins gekauft.

Ist es Einsteiger freundlich ? 
=> Auch hier ein Jaein, wer bereits viele Action RPG`s gezockt hat wird etwas schneller ins Spiel finden, wer keine Erfahrungen hat wird es sehr schwer haben aber gut Ding will Weile haben :P.
Also einfach Google nutzen und man wird schnell merken das die PoE Community ins gesamt nett und freundlich ist und es gibt ne menge Anfänger guides von größeren Streamern. Hier und da sollte man also bei Twitch.tv sich Builds in Action ansehen oder im Forum einen Build heraussuchen ;).
Und lasst euch nicht vom Skill Baum abschrecken, man wird diesen lieben wenn man das Spiel mehr und mehr versteht, genau dieser bietet einen unglaubliche Freiheiten seinen Charakter einzigartig zu machen und evtl. einen wirklich guten Build zu erstellen.

Ist es auf deutsch spielbar ?
=> JA!!!!, es ist nun möglich es auf DEUTSCH zu stellen !!!!! ;-)  

Diablo III oder POE ?
=> Ich spiele beides, aber PoE bietet sag ich mal 10x so viel und ist F2P , auch grafisch mag ich PoE mehr da es düsterer, brutaler und gnadenloser ist.

Gibt es einen Harcore Modus ?
=> Ja, der gestorbene Charakter landet in Sofcore. Anders als in Diablo III gibt es keine passive Fähigkeit die dich retten kann.

Ist die Story gut erzählt ?
=>Nein, keine tollen Videos und auch kaum Vertonung, der Fokus lag wie es richtig ist, auf dem Gameplay, aber mitlerweile wird mehr und mehr vertont und nachgebessert.

Gibt es ein Late-Game ?
=> Ja und zwar ein absolut geaniales Late-Game !, mit lvl 60 ist man ca. fertig mit der Story welche man 3mal durchpielt (Normal,Cruel,Merciless), nach einiger Erfahrung geht das ziemlich schnell. Im Late-Game läuft man Maps welche durch Portale geöffnet werden und zufällig generiert werden, der Name der Map gibt einem Info darüber wie das Layout ca aussehen wird und welcher Boss auf einem wartet, auch hier die PoE wiki nutzen oder Ytube Videos schauen wie der Boss Fight ablaufen wird.

Gibt es einen Trade Markt wo Spieler untereinander handeln ?
=> JA, es gibt kein Gold oder ähnliches, im Spiel findet man Orbs welche zu Iteam craften genutzt werden können oder auch als Währung, dabei sind diese aufgrund ihrer verschiedenen Seltenheit unterschiedlich viel Wert, am Ende ist es ehher ein tausch System, ich gebe dir ``x`` von und du gibst mir deine Armor.
 
Am Ende kann ich nur sagen das es sich hier um ein Spiel handelt, für welches man viel Zeit haben sollte, der Anfang wird sehr schwer sein da es sehr viele Meschaniken gibt, wenn du also ein Spiel suchst an dem du dich messen kannst und dich frei entwickeln kannst bist du bei PoE genau richtig.

Hier noch ein paar links zu Seiten dich euch sicher weiter helfen werden ;)

www.twitch.tv <--- hier einfach mal Builds live in Action anschauen und evtl Leute im Chat um Hilfe bitten, wie gesagt ist der große Teil der Community sehr nett, liegt vermutlich daran das es nicht competitive ist ^^.

MfG Schlomo und viel Spaß beim spielen !!!! | La verdad es que era bastante reticente a probar este juego. En primer lugar, no me gustan los ""free2play"". Suelen acabar en ""pay 2 win"", comunidades tóxicas, DLCs sospechosamente obligatorios, y una calidad general bastante baja. Además, tengo todos los Diablo comprados, desde el I al III con todas sus expansiones. Teniendo el original, ¿para que jugar a un clon? 

Pues Path of Exile me ha sorprendido. 

En primer lugar, en la tienda del juego sólo venden objetos cosméticos, espacio de almacenamiento, y packs de soporte. Nada que afecte al desarrollo del personaje o al poder de los objetos.

En cuanto al desarrollo del personaje, el juego tiene 19 clases de partida. Pero no son clases cerradas, sino más bien ""zonas de inicio"" que puedes desarrollar a través de un árbol con cientos (literalmente) de skills pasivos. 

Tiene mucho contenido, diez actos. Muchas misiones secundarias, aleatorias, y tramas paralelas (maestros, refugio, etc...). Cada cierto tiempo abren una liga, en la que todos los jugadores empiezan de cero y hay algún evento específico.

La ambientación del mundo es muy siniestra, a ratos realmente gore. Me gusta la historia. Gráficamente no están mal, aunque no está a la altura de Diablo. 

El sistema de juego está lleno de buenas ideas. Por ejemplo, no hay habilidades activas, se consiguen a través de gemas que se engarzan en el equipo. Las gemas pueden subirse de nivel, y hasta hay gemas de soporte que potencian el efecto de otras gemas. 

Hay pociones, como en Diablo 2, pero se rellenan solas cuando matas enemigos, no tienes que llevar 500 pociones en el inventario.

Sistema de crafting básico y avanzado. Se pueden mejorar y alterar los objetos, reforjar estadísticas, etc...

En resumen, un ARPG hardcore, con una curva de aprendizaje un poco bestia al principio, pero con muchísimas posibilidades. Encima gratis y sin pay2win. No sé que más se puede pedir. |

Path of Exile é um RPG de ação 3D publicado pela Grinding Gear Games. Semelhante a jogos como Diablo e Torchlight, Path of Exile permite aos jogadores explorar vários calabouços (dungeons) nas formas de história ""Atos"". Os jogadores têm uma grande variedade de classes iniciais para escolher, mas cada classe serve apenas como o ponto de partida inicial para a progressão do personagem de um jogador.

Os jogadores têm a sua disponibilidade uma enorme quantidade de gemas (skill gems) e opções passivas da skill tree. As gemas podem ser encaixadas no equipamento do personagem e concedem uma escala larga das habilidades, que dependem do tipo e da cor da gema. As gemas podem até subir de nível para fornecer uma versão mais forte da skill. A árvore de habilidades é um conjunto vasto e complexo de combinações de skills passivas. Cada jogador pode escolher entre uma enorme variedade de alocações pontuais para realmente personalizar a sua classe de personagens.

Path of Exile apresenta tanto PvE e PvP com eventos como corridas de nivelamento que ocorrem em servidores dedicados. Outras variações incluem um modo Cut-Throat, onde os jogadores podem invadir instâncias de outros jogadores e matá-los para levar seus itens. Cada evento pode durar de apenas uma hora a vários meses e premiar valiosos prêmios para os vencedores. Os fãs da mecânica de rastreamento de dungeons (*dungeon crawling) mais tradicionais encontrados no Diablo 2 devem definitivamente dar uma chance ao Path of Exile.

*Sistema [b]dungeon crawling[/b]:

O sistema de [b]dungeon crawling[/b] é um tipo de cenário em jogos de role-playing de fantasia em que os heróis navegam em um ambiente labiríntico, lutando contra vários monstros e saqueando qualquer tesouro que possam encontrar. Devido à sua simplicidade, o dungeon crawling pode ser mais fácil para um *gamemaster executar do que aventuras mais complexas, e o estilo de ""hack and slash"" é apreciado por jogadores que se concentram em ação e combate.

*Um [b]gamemaster[/b] ( GM , também conhecido como mestre de jogo , gerente de jogo , moderador de jogo ou árbitro ) é uma pessoa que atua como um organizador, oficiante para perguntas sobre regras, arbitragem para um jogo de RPG multiplayer .Eles são mais comuns em jogos cooperativos em que os jogadores trabalham juntos do que em jogos competitivos em que os jogadores se opõem uns aos outros. O ato realizado por um gamemaster é às vezes referido como ""Gamemastering"" ou simplesmente ""GM-ing"".
O papel básico do gamemaster é o mesmo em quase todos os jogos tradicionais de role-playing, embora diferentes conjuntos de regras tornam os deveres específicos do gamemaster exclusivo para esse sistema.

[b]Prós:[/b]

-Bons gráficos que trabalham mesmo em PCs low-end, efeitos sonoros de alta fidelidade.
-Boa história
-Ambientação e efeitos bem elaborados, ótimo final.
-Totalmente free to play.
-Se você decidir investir dinheiro, todos os preços estão bem equilibrados.
-Muitos itens
-Cópia fiel ao Diablo 2
-Skill tree avançada 

[b]Contras:[/b]

-Alguns problemas de atraso e desconexões aleatórias, Não posso dizer que é perfeito, mas eu jogo tranquilamente com ping bem baixo. Porém, vejo algumas pessoas com problemas de vez em quando.
-Pontos de controle são muito distantes, por esse motivo o jogador tem que correr para o objetivo com a necessidade de perder alguns minutos em vez de usar o teleporte para checkpoints, que são muito longes do objetivo da missão.
- Customizaçao de personagens.


Lendo o site ficou claro que foi produzido de fã para fãs, devido a frases como:

[i] - ""Totalmente gratuito e nunca será pay to win""
- ""Estamos cansados da moda de fadas e luzes, Path Of Exile é realístico e escuro""[/i] 
E muitas outras...

Path Of Exile está de parabéns e merece respeito já por isto, recomendo para jogadores assíduos e que veneram o estilo Old School.


[b]Nota final 8/10.[/b]

 | Первый обзор, постараюсь кратко и со смыслом.

Отличный аналог Диабло, не могу сказать что он лучше или хуже, но для проекта, который создавался на минимум бюджета, оооочень недурственно. 
  Из плюсов: 
- Очень улыбнула графика. Она выдержана в своем стиле, сразу переносишься во времена Diablo2, когда было все ради фана и атмосферы.
- Для небольшого количества героев, просто огромный выбор классов. Благодаря системе развития пассивных навыков, это просто надо увидеть и попробовать, лично я остался под огромным впечатлением. Можно конечно канониченых магов, лучников и варов делать, но так же невесело. +)
- Понравился сюжетный режим. Несомненный плюс в прохождении с друзьями, опять таки за счет того, что билды героев нестандартны и очень вариотивны. Можно творить все, что вздумается, а это большая редкость для РПГ.
- Система активных скилов и крафта выполнена на высоте. Аналогов я просто не встречал, просто один раз попробовать и самому увидеть лучше, чем сто раз прочитать любой из обзоров.
  Из минусов:
- Лично для меня из минусов стала мини карта и ее большой брат, очень тускло, постоянно режет глаза. Но на это можно забить большой болт. Лично мое мнение.
- Есть еще один момент, касаемо новичков. Придется много читать статей и гайдов по героям, ибо настает момент, когда Вы попросту можете дальше не пройти из-за своего билда, нестандартаня раскачка весло, но может стать занозой в ягодной части при прохождении в соло. Опять таки может это у меня руки кривые, а у Вас все получится. +)

По итогу. В PoE обязательно стоит попробовать полиграть всем ценителям РПГ жанра, я уверяю тебя уважаемый читатель, равнодушным проект не оставит, хоть сначала может показаться странным и тяжеловатым. Но. Оно того определенно стоит. Ни разу не пожалел проведенного времени, жаль мало набегал, ибо все время свободное отнимает КС.
10 из 10 тысяч вариантов пасивок!!! Одобренно!!! +)"
76561198032898393,214420,Gear Up,2.033333333333333,"Action, Free To Play, Indie",6,"What a shame. Although it isn't a very good game for today's standards, I think I can safely say most people enjoyed playing it back then. There was a unique concept within Gear Up and a truly special experience created. It had a lot of potential, and could've been something amazing. [i] *queue the VSauce music* [/i] But it wasn't and it died off... why is that? 

Well from the start of it's release it was a finished product. Nothing new or exciting happened at all afterwards. Having a multiplayer game finished straight out of the gates isn't inherently a problem, as games like CS:GO and TF2 have proven to stand against the test of time unchanged. What do these have that Gear Up doesn't? Obviously they're backed up by a massive corporation that everybody using steam knows(Valve), where as Gear Up is from Doctor Entertainment, a company almost nobody has ever heard of. Why would this matter; many small businesses game developers have proven to be successful. The problem is with an action packed multiplayer game, the fanbase is going to explode, requiring constant updates and support. If there are no preparations for that, it's going to crash. Unbalanced games with no signs of updating just simply cannot support it. 

Games like CS:GO and TF2 work because the people running it can provide the support needed for an exponentially growing community, and Gear Up simply can't. On top of that there's pay to win features in Gear Up which unlock everything instantaneously, ruining the quirky game progression of buying random parts and testing which ones you like. This causes many to lose interest easily, as you can buy an overpowered combination and everything you were working for in the game is gone. Many games have fallen victim to P2W, Gear Up is no different, but it's sad to see it fall under the pressure of a rising community. 

TL;DR
game dead as my dog | Alright, I was pleasently surprised with this game so here's teh simple breakdown:

Pros:
-Fun, fast paced style of gameplay. Death results in a few short seconds and you drop back onto the field.
-Style/Attitude works well, its heavilty stylized to not look too realistic nor too cartoony. Its a little whimsical and I personally like that. It doesnt take itself too seriously and therefore is an easy pick up and learn to play sort of game.
-Decent variety of parts, game types, etc.  You can build just about anything you'd like and play in a usual range of PvP game types, Deathmatch, with or without teams, capture the point. There may be a couple others I'd forgotten about but its all very standard.
-The tank controls are difficult but not too stupidly hard. They require some getting used to, but they make kills feel earned and skilled. One of a short list of PC titles I chose to play using keyboard and mouse rather than my xbox controller.

Cons:
-Pay to win; If you dont shell out the $20 price tag you have to earn your tank parts and customizations like in a normal game. Thats fine with me, but if you DO spend the money, every part in the game is instantly unlocked. There do not appear to be any game breaking destructive weapons that allow you to dominated if you have them, however the spirit of the game ruined by the random matches full of folks who spent the cash and have the best tank they could design.
-This means you better play with friends to have fun. Now I'm not saying you cant pick this game up and play against randoms and not have a good time. However logging in with a group of pals and building machines of war and playfully blowing eachother up is way better.
-The Host system is a little bit... not good. Its the usual idea, when you are in the lobby you can click a button to invite your list of friends. The problem is that it checks them off so you cannot resend the invite if there is an issue. And there were issues. A couple instances where players did not recieve the invite and the only fix was to back out and start a new room. There also is no 'ready up' system where the host can launch the game for everyone. Everyone in the lobby has to hit their respective 'start game' button before anything happens. Not game breaking, but clunky.

Final thoughts:
Yes. Download the free version, skype with some friends, and start building your tanks. It was absolutly worth the time and effort put in and was a lot of fun. I may even pay for the basic package that grants you extra colors to paint your tank in and unlimited storage so I can collect more than 9 parts at a time. The game looks good, feels good, and has some degree of depth to it that I enjoy (Like using a spider tank to clamber clumsily up the wall to avoid my enemies). | [h1]有中文,有国服,最重要的是还不用花钱，一定值得您一试[/h1]

[h1]不多说了，总之，这是整个steam我个人最推荐给广大萌新朋友的游戏，没有之一[/h1] | 装備をカスタマイズして乗り回す戦車ゲーム。多脚もホバーもあるよ！
　ロボクラほど自由度は無いですが、誰でもちゃんと動くマシンが作れます（大事）。

　無料では装備をアンロックしていく必要があり、Basicはアンロック速度上昇＋マシンを３台までセーブ可能。プレミアムは最初から全部アンロックされている状態になります。最初は無料プレイで十分です。物足りなくなったらプレミアム化しましょう。
　ゲームモードはコンクエスト、デスマッチ、チームデスマッチの３種類あるため、それなりに気分で遊ぶことができます。装備は各種ゲームの勝敗がつくと貰えるゴールドで購入できますが、１ゲーム最長１０分程度のため初期装備で辛い時間が長くなる可能性はあります。そのため、最初の乗り出し等ではコンクエストのOasisオンリーで早回しすることでゴールドを貯める小技をすると、カスタマイズが手早くできていい感じです。

　マッチングサーバというものが無く、個人がそれぞれ部屋を作ってそこにみんなで乗り込む形なので、部屋の平均ランクを見て自分のランクと同じぐらいの部屋に行かないと無双されるだけになってしまいます。ここらへんは改善が必要だと思います。

　１ゲームが短めなので、空き時間にちょろっと遊んだりするのにうってつけなゲームです。無料だし、容量は2015/01/31現在、約1GBしかないので気軽にどうぞ。

※2015/02/01追記：Basic及びPremiumについて

両方通過したのでそれぞれの違いを。なお、BasicもPremiumも買い切りです。

無料版　：マシンは1台のみ。パーツは1マッチ終了時に貰えるゴールドでアンロック。保持できるパーツ数は初期10個で以降レベルアップごとに1個上昇。

Basic　：マシンは3台までセーブ可能。保持パーツ数上限解除。1マッチ終了時に貰える参加料が無料版の1枚から2枚に上昇。プレミアム版の価格50%オフ。

Premium：Basicに加えて、パーツの購入作業不要（全パーツを自由に使える）。Extrasメニュー追加（シューティングレンジマップ、Bot戦、操作のリプレイによる撮影モード、何かいっぱい作ったマシンが並んでるだけのマップ）。

プレミアムはアンロック作業がなくなるため、プレイする動機が1つ減ってしまうのであんまりオススメできないかも知れません。アンロックめんどくさいんじゃーって人向けです。作ったマシンをBot相手に試す気がないならば、Basicで十分だと思います。 | I am recommending this game 2 years after its release. Even now, it is fun to play with the various hulls and turrets to take down anyone in your path.
 
Pros:
Well designed game
Fun to play with friends
Awesome combinations
Challenging multiplayer battles

Cons:
If you dont start out in private matches with friends, you will die nearly immediately
Disbalanced in-game matches (any level can join)
Slow gear upgrades
Only partially optimized
You have to pay to get infinite slots if you want all the gear

Ways to get rid of Cons:
Start playing with friends, then move to random multiplayer
Make private matches with friends
Buy premium or basic dlc (premium better)
Lower graphics settings, then it runs smooth
(Not really a bypass to this, but its not a pay to win)

Overall Review:
Although this game needs a bit more optimization and balancing, you can be a top player within days of playing. I think this game is more suitable for 5-10 friends (including yourself) to play together to have more fun. I do wish the game had certain restrictions on ranks for joining online matches, because my first few matches i was lucky enough to be put on a 6+ rank team against 1-5 rank team (rookie team) so I gained more money than i probably should have to start. Premium Gear Up is a good DLC game. I recommend this to anyone who wont ragequit, but rather be patient whenever they die, but they will have to learn to accept that losing is a major possibility.

8.5/10 would die again.

P.S. This is my first review, is it good?"

По сути говоря, это файтинг, но файтинг весьма своеобразный, можно даже сказать, исключительный. В качестве героев выступают собранные из шариков и кубиков куклы, поначалу находящиеся в статичном режиме. Целью игры является нанесение как можно большего урона противнику посредством выбора удачной комбинации движений. Игроки самостоятельно решают, как именно они будут действовать в отдельно взятом раунде. Куклы могут драться руками, ногами и головой, совершать прыжки и уклонения – все зависит от манеры поведения самих геймеров. Кажется, что все весьма просто, но это не так. Чтобы исполнить мало-мальски удобоваримое комбо, нужно учесть множество факторов (Toribash базируется на чистой физике), а на выполнение красивой и продуманной атаки и вовсе придется затратить уйму времени и сил. Почему? Все дело в этих самых шариках и кубиках, из которых состоят куклы. Если просто-напросто ткнуть на активные точки-фигуры, не проведя никаких вычислений, то кукла, скорее всего, грохнется на пол, ни капельки не повредив оппоненту. 

Залог победы в Toribash – тщательный и скрупулезный анализ своих действий. Нужно учитывать, в какой позе находится боец, какое у него состояние: напряженное или расслабленное, куда он отклоняется в процессе битвы и так далее. Да, все это достаточно сложно, но куда труднее было бы, если поединки в Toribash проходили в режиме реального времени. Но в Toribash реализован пошаговый режим, благодаря которому игроки могут более-менее адекватно контролировать своих подопечных, хотя и это не является панацеей. Конечно, особенно сильно страдают новички, столкнувшиеся с Toribash впервые, но даже они, при должной доле усидчивости, могут поднатореть в драках за пару-тройку деньков, а за неделю – достичь по-настоящему серьезных успехов. Но стать мастеровитым “сенсеем” все равно не выйдет ни за две недели, ни за три – тут уже потребуется месяц серьезнейших тренировок. | wish it had a single player mode to earn those damned creds for unlocks but then again i would like to be able to make a full move set as a combat style | .Try to use tatics

-36 | I've played this game quite a lot in the past before it was released to Steam. By no means was I good, especially since the game has a rather large learning curve. This learning curve comes from the fact that various joints must be manipulated to get results, but casual players (especially friends) will often find hilarity due to the manipulation of their characters sometimes in rather awkward positions. Multiplayer games are rather fast-paced compared to singleplayer sessions due to the timer which limits the time players can think before it runs out. Otherwise, various mods come with the game which adds plenty of PvP options (arena type, weapons, body sensitivity, etc.), or solo challenges (parkour, skateboarding, sports, etc.).

In terms of play by more seasoned/veteran players (not including myself), other players can find interest in the rather complicated techniques used to simulate real fights or complete parkour maps.

Overall, this game takes a long time to fully understand since the tutorial does not completely cover everything, but once players get past this, they'll find many challenges to overcome."

1、共同回合的机制。对战双方同时执行自己的回合，然后统一结算。富有战略性，能体验运筹帷幄的快乐。
2、对战区域的划分。包括进攻区域、防守区域、支援区域、指挥官区域，以及由它们组成的概念：被部署区域、战场。区域的划分和不同区域特定的功能大大扩展了对战策略的可能性。
3、卡组机制。组成套牌前对势力的选择决定了你整个套牌的风格和可利用的资源，要求玩家不断取舍，最终完成自己喜欢的战术。
4、比较轻松的游戏体验。不需要大量的时间、精力和金钱投入。
当你在了解了整个游戏从确立思路、组建套牌到最终随机应变取得胜利之后，游戏的体验会相当不错。然而这款游戏的诸多缺点也就来源于玩家这个熟悉过程之前。
1、中文翻译不完整，概念解释缺失。游戏初期有诸多不加解释的概念，严重影响玩家融入游戏。包括组建套牌时的规则不明确，会让新手玩家摸不着头脑。
2、糟糕的网络连接。较差的网络环境甚至不能让你完整体验一场游戏。
3、UI（交互界面元素）设计不合理，拥有较多生物时会拥挤，难以精确操作。画面特效单一。
当玩家熟悉了这些之后，我仍然认为这款游戏值得喜爱卡牌游戏的玩家尝试一下。同时也希望官方能加紧改正上述缺点（如果可能的话）
希望我的体验能帮到大家，祝大家游戏愉快。
 | É um jogo de cartas animado em que você coloca diversas criaturas para duelar em seu nome. São vários adversários em uma campanha longa, que passa por diversos lugares e enfrenta desafiantes poderosos e repletos de recursos para frear a sua jornada.
Jogo bom, porém algumas funções meia confusas. | 粗略玩了一下.简单地来说一说自己的观点.
优点:
1.相较于其他卡牌游戏,双方同时执行回合的玩法增加了游戏的战略性
2.每个种族的特性较为鲜明
3.场地被划分为3块(支援区,进攻区,防守区)的玩法也增加了游戏的战略性

缺点:
1.每个玩家虽然拥有两种血量,但其实第二种血量(士气)基本只是为了龙族之裔的削士气战术单独服务.95%的时候士气都是多余的.作为游戏中的重要参数之一,略显累赘
2.卡牌技能介绍做地非常差,是我玩过的所有卡牌游戏中最差的一款,这足以成为让新人弃坑的原因.举例:人族某卡被部属在进攻区域后会拥有坚不可摧特性,至于坚不可摧是什么,我翻遍了游戏都没找到解释.也许是不受战斗伤害,也许是不会受到伤害,也许就是无敌.同上还有超载X,激怒X,虚弱X,生命X等
3.游戏的卡包过多,而且无法得知卡包内所包含的所有卡.只能通过牌组中浏览所有卡来逆向搜索自己想要的卡所在的卡包.
4.卡片虽然可以交易,但是与此同时也少了拆分合成功能.低稀有度卡极易数量溢出.且对于独狼玩家来说伤害巨大.
5.牌组组合界面操作相当难受,你能同时浏览到的牌只有一行约10张.而滚动牌堆时的操作惯性相当违和,稍微滚动一点只能翻过几张,而再稍微多滚动一点则是会一口气翻过去很多张.与此同时,当你想把牌加入指挥官位置时,如果放置位置不当,就会把所有同名卡全部移除牌组,然后你又不得不自己一张一张加回来.
6.游戏技巧需要玩家自己挖掘,战斗前的读取界面没有实用的小提示.举例:一般卡片的牌组数量限制为3,被加入到指挥官位置的卡不会被算入卡组数量限制.即,一张数量限制为3的卡最多可以在牌组中添加6张(指挥官位置X3+牌组X3).
7.游戏系统极其难受,当你在场上拥有大量单位以后,他们将在区域里挤成一团.而如果你想拉动他们到其他区域,你需要极其小心且不得不一张一张地拉动它们,假如你还想将他们的位置顺序交换,你还得再小心翼翼地拉动它们.整个过程对操作的精度要求比较高,至少不像是从手牌拍怪那样按住鼠标往上甩就好了.

虽然我列举的缺点比优点多很多,而且也不推荐这款游戏.但是我还是比较喜欢这款游戏的.优点虽然少,但是核心玩法还是可圈可点的.而且缺点大部分也不会经常经历.

至于不推荐的理由:
1.这款游戏不适合入门级卡牌游戏玩家以及欠缺耐心和金钱的玩家.游戏已经开服很久了,对于现在入坑的玩家来说,要补的卡包数量相当可观.而且由于没有卡片拆分合成系统.要不氪金完全组出自己的牌组需要以月为单位来积累.当然你能找到大佬免费送你卡当我没说.
2.2014年9月5日发行的游戏,我今天2017年2月12日刚玩了8.1个小时(通完剧情,教程,挑战,打了盘竞技场,开玩送的卡包,又自己买了一包开,自己组了一套牌组)就能发现游戏还有那么多不方便的地方,其中几个地方还令人发指(战斗时卡片聚堆)这让我对游戏开发商的态度以及能力表示怀疑. | wonderful game, can't understand all the hate is receiving. It's fun and entertaining, a perfect way to spend an hour or two in front of the pc. 

To the devs: please fix the japanese faction (you know, the green one based on morale ) because they're absolute trash right now, lol. | I have not played the remake of this game recently, but one big reason, and I hope the creators stop going down this path:

They've split their already small cult following into 3 by publishing 3 similar games with the same IP and similar gameplay. Not sure what the goal of that was, when their player base is already fairly small, because it's going to make me and others reluctant to invest in Infinity Wars Classic if it's going to be replaced by Infinity Wars 2 in the future. They really need to combine the games back into one, focus on it, and make it hit critical mass so that players can actually start recommending it to their friends.

EDIT: Thanks for the explanation! This makes more sense than what I had originally understood, so I've updated the review accordingly.

I will say that while I still have some doubts, the game design of Infinity Wars is honestly a masterpiece, it solves all the problems I've had with other online card games (like Hearthstone/MTGO) in the past. I'll highlight the two biggest points which I think other online card games got wrong.

Firstly, there's actual trading, and it doesn't feel like MTGO where it feels like you're trading with a stock market because there's thousands of copies of each card. It feels much more like going to a card game store and trading with friends, because there's multiple different rarities which make the more rare card+rarity combinations rare enough that they feel unique. This means that people will haggle, or look around to find someone who has that one card they've been looking for. Feels very much like trading in-person.

Secondly, it removes the RNG aspect of mana-based card games in the early game. Games with lands like MTG and Eternal suffer from mana flood/drought, which adds an unnecessary and un-fun element of RNG to the game. However, even Hearthstone which does not have lands, suffers from early game RNG because drawing cards on curve is extremely important to surviving/winning the early game, and makes early game much more RNG dependent than lategame. This game fixes both problems by having automatic mana increases like Hearthstone, but also giving you a choice of 3 Commanders which you can choose during deck-building to start every game with. This lets you pick defensive early game, and scaling options as a control deck, so you don't end up skipping your first 4 turns like other card games, and high tempo high power cards for aggro decks, so you don't feel like you just fall behind early game and have no hope because of a bad draw.

This review may have become very long, but it's because I honestly believe Infinity Wars is the best designed card game out there, and as long as they can get the UI/marketing done right, it will be a huge hit in my opinion."
76561198032898393,225260,Brutal Legend,1.0166666666666666,"Action, Adventure, Strategy",0,"[h2] O metal NÃO está morto [/h2]

Brutal Legend é uma baita homenagem ao rock n' roll em geral, incorporando todo o apelo dos seus diferentes subgêneros num cenário totalmente literal. No controle de Eddy, interpretado por nosso querido Jack Black, exploramos um mundo aberto em plena Era do Metal, um futuro apocalíptico onde a música e a magia são basicamente a mesma coisa. Os humanos, divididos e hostilizados, são ainda escravizados por hordas de demônios, em meio de biomas diferentes e de paisagens impressionantes. A muralha dos amplificadores, a floresta da cerveja e as minas do gelo seco são apenas um gostinho do que há no cenário, onde muitos dos seus NPCs são baseados em ícones reais, como Ozzy Osbourne (Black Sabbath) e Lemmy (Motorhead). 

Com um gameplay fraco e bastante repetitivo, o fantástico mundo aberto é preenchido por atividades repetidas que podem ser encontradas a cada novo bioma explorado. Elas se consistem em saltos com o nosso carro customizável, o ""Diabo Flamejante"", várias corridas, além de coletáveis como solos de guitarra e estátuas de dragão. A missão principal oferece menos enrolação, onde levamos a luta através da nossa ""turnê"" diretamente aos caricatos vilões. Há também um sistema de batalhas de palco contra palco, onde controlamos tropas num estilo de jogo de estratégia em tempo real. Esses momentos são específicos de trechos da campanha, apesar de representarem 100% do seu multiplayer, onde jogadores podem batalhar entre si (Sim, o online ainda funciona!!).

Mi historia se titula: Juanita, el ciclo de Diógenes.

Juanita, una humana que vivía como vagabunda en las calles de The Hub, hace tiempo atrás sus padres fueron arrebatados para ser esclavos. Esto marco mucho a Juanita.

Ya con mayoría de edad ella decide migrar a una ciudad con más oportunidades, una vez en el lugar empieza a recolectar minerales para vender y vivir de esto. Un día en el bar de la ciudad conoce a Chona una Shek, es esclava de un noble local, Chona le pide favor de liberarla a un precio de 3000 cats, Juanita recordando el pasado traumatico que tuvo no puede evitar ayudarla. Una vez Chona liberada se hacen amigas inseparables y empieza a trabajar juntas en la mineria, pasa el tiempo y compran una casa. El esfuerzo da frutos.

Una noche caminando por las calles de la ciudad ven a una Shek llorando, extrañamente esta no tenia cuernos, Chona no puede controlar sus impulsos y pregunta ¿que ha pasado?, la chica se presenta como Ruka y les dice que su grupo la ha dejado porque en su ultima batalla perdió los cuernos y los Sheks siempre quieren transmitir poder y verse imponentes, por la falta de sus cuernos no podian permitirle estar con ellos. 

Ruka sabe que su historia no ha terminado, tiene las habilidades para hacer algo grande, pide favor si se puede unir a ellas, no tiene donde dormir. Juanita y Chona aceptan. Las tres chicas trabajan en mineria y hacen pijamadas, esto ayuda a reforzar su relación. Con el tiempo llegan a tener mucho dinero, aun así a Juanita no le gusta esa vida rutinaria de trabajo, ella recuerda que su padre, Mufasa, le contaba historias de piratas espaciales en busca del tesoro de mil mundos, Juanita quería vivir historias similares y buscar el tesoro que le cambiaría la vida. Le propone a Chona y Ruka un viaje sin dirección, sabiendo que las tres cuentan con experiencia en combate y podrán cuidarse entre ellas estas aceptan, así que proceden a vender todos sus bienes y parten a lo desconocido.

En su viaje liberan a unos pocos esclavos que se unen a ellas, pasan muchos sucesos en el camino, tienen batallas con bandidos, mercenarios y soldados. Poco a poco su grupo crece y se hace de un nombre, los Wachiturros. Pero más importante, se hacen una familia. Más adelante este grupo encuentra un lugar verde con agua, fauna y flora comestible, perfecto para establecerse y vivir en paz, la mayoría del grupo decide asentarse pero Juanita dice que aun no encuentra su tesoro y no parará hasta conseguirlo. Ruka trata de convencerla de quedarse pero esta hace caso omiso, Chona quiere quedarse pero no puede abandonar a su mejor amiga, así que las dos parten. Este episodio fue muy emotivo.

Llegan a ciudad donde los soldados son samurais muy bien entrenados, tienen que tener mucho cuidado al robar para poder alimentarse porque seria un reto enfrentarse a ellos. Juanita siendo una experta en saqueos por ser latina, toma el riesgo de allanar un establecimiento, la descubren y rápidamente los soldados las rodean. Logran abatir a varios pero Juanita es noqueada y llevada a prisión, Chona viendo que ella sola no puede hacerles frente decide escapar. Días después cuando la seguridad disminuye Chona se infiltra y logra sacar a Juanita, las dos huyen de la ciudad hasta quedarse sin aliento.

Cuando Chona enciende la fogata le pregunta a Juanita ¿que estas haciendo? estas persiguiendo algo que no sabes si siquiera existe, podemos morir si seguimos así. Juanita furiosa por lo que escucho le dice ¨yo no te pedí venir¨. Chona triste porque no pudo hacer entrar en razón a su amiga le dice que se irá, que espera que encuentre lo que busca y cuando eso pase regrese con el grupo. Chona se retira al amanecer.

Juanita pasa por muchas cosas, se enfrenta a caza-recompensas, a maquinas aracnoides, bestias de ciencia ficción, todo esto con el objetivo de encontrar su tesoro. Un día empieza a caer una lluvia roja extraña, levanta la mirada para contemplar ese cielo diferente, algo llama su atención, una construcción abandonada al pico de la montaña más alta. Lo encontré ella piensa, y se dirige al lugar. Entra al lugar y hay tecnología que ella nunca había visto, almacenes cerrados con quien sabe que y varios materiales valiosos esparcidos por los suelos. En eso caen arañas delgadas a su alrededor, ya se había enfrentado a ellas con anterioridad pero estas eran demasiadas para hacerles frente. Intenta huir pero cae, ve rojo a su alrededor, preguntándose si es la lluvia extraña que cae del cielo o su sangre, repentinamente todo se vuelve negro.

Despierta, milagrosamente logro sobrevivir porque los seres que la atacaron perdieron interés al momento que dejo de retorcerse. Al incorporarse logra caminar pero con un dolor punzante e insoportable en el abdomen, solo piensa que tiene que llegar a un lugar seguro. Después horas de camino logra dislumbrar a la lejanía un pueblo a aproximadamente a un día de distancia al ritmo que ella llevaba, esa noche decide descansar en una colina, encender una fogata y tratar sus heridas, al rato de esto se recuesta y ve al cielo diciéndose a ella misma que no sabe que hacer, ¨estoy perdida¨ ella exclamó, sus ojos se humedecen y piensa que es la misma niña que perdió a sus padres tiempo atrás, nada ha cambiado, sigo sola durmiendo en el exterior. Ve al cielo oscuro de nuevo, esta vez sus ojos se posan en el planeta que nunca desaparece del horizonte siempre acompañada de su luna, es poético que siempre una se tenga a la otra en compañía, ella pensó. En ese momento que se dio cuenta que mucho estoicismo hace mal y que el verdadero tesoro son los amigos que hizo en el camino. | A slow burn but worth the struggle. Do yourself a favor, pretend it’s a time when we didn’t have access to reliable guides for everything. Morrowind is the most direct comparison for me, even though Kenshi has extremely limited dialogue, and no grand plan for you.

Where it’s like Morrowind is the exploration and discovery. Closer to “radiant storytelling,” but even that’s generous. You tell the story here. Zero hand holding. Forget quest markers, there are no quests. The world keeps going while you’re doing your thing, and you’ll decide if, when, and where to jump in to things. Except everything wants to kill or enslave you.

Give it a shot. If you don’t like it, give it another shot. It takes failure to not only learn game mechanics, but to train character skills. If you're really struggling and about to give up, I suggest searching for some way to get early game money. But do not read up on the game beyond that. Go in blind and fail until you don’t. Enjoy. | La libertad que te da este juego no tiene comparación.

It's too repetitive after a few playthroughs. I played it through four times, but after failing to get a new ending despite playing very differently on my fourth run, I lost the motivation to play again. Each run takes around 45 minutes, which is way too long for such repetitive content when you might not even get a new ending. Unlike a conventional visual novel, you can't skip sections you've already read because you need to forge your personality, earn respect, etc., and the game mostly consists of one-off mini stories in the form of ""adventures"" so there's really no underlying storyline to skip in the first place. On the same token, your personality and respect level do very little to change the content except at certain key stages. And several of the endings seem to be slightly different variations of the same thing.

Basically, the idea is way better than the implementation.

Mais um joguinho de carrinhos de rádio controle, mas muito divertido e cheio de referências à outros jogos, personagens de desenhos animados e personagens da vida real, como o Senna. A mecânica do jogo já é conhecida e muito parecida com WRC Powerslide: Você controla a direção do carrinho com o analógico e acelera sem parar. Diferentemente do WRC, você não usa somente esquerda/direita, mas aponta na direção que quer que o carro siga e isso vai criar algumas estranheza no começo, mas logo você se acostuma. O fator diversão é alto, principalmente se conseguir jogar online com alguns amigos. Vi no fórum que algumas pessoas reclamam de não conseguir jogar online, algo que ainda não testei, então não posso opinar. A graça do jogo está em disputar cada centímetro de curva com os adversários e tocá-los significa perder muita velocidade e tempo.

Fiquei jogando direto por 3 horas e ainda tenho vontade de jogar. | ☺ Easy to play.
☺ Lovely visuals.
☺ Brilliantly realised Portal and Team Fortress 2 maps.

☹ Unchallenging.
☹ Wonky physics.
☹ Drunk AI Drivers.

(Note: This game was played with a controller).

Mini Motor Racing EVO is a casual top down racer suitable for most ages, with easy to grasp controls and an aesthetic that greatly reminds me of playing with toy cars as a youngster.

While there is a decent selection of maps (and most notably the Portal and Team Fortress 2 maps are brilliantly realised), they quickly become repetitive as you play them again and again through the championships - in forward, reverse and with the camera on a slightly different angle (which is a surprisingly clever way of making the same track play a little differently). There is also an ingame editor linked to the Steam Workshop to create, share and download other tracks which is very simple to do.

While enjoyable to zip around the tracks and drift around corners, the AI opposition rarely put up any challenge at all (the exception being a couple of maps where you could do with a speed upgrade, that is easily passed the moment you have acquired it or a higher top speed vehicle). It also appears the AI Drivers have been drinking...while it's nice that they don't always perform the perfect lap, they will frequently slam into corners or boost directly into a wall.

The physics in the game can cause frustration, as you slap to a halt after performing a jump or snag on a slightly uphill piece of track.  There is also an oddity that before a race gets underway you get a glimpse of the tablet UI for the game, but that doesn't impact the experience in any meaningful way.

At the time of writing, there were no active multiplayer servers.

It's very hard to recommend Mini Motor Racing EVO except for the extremely casual gamer who's unfamiliar with racing titles and just wants a little fun zipping around a track. | If you can ignore the ease in which your little mini motor racing car can be spun out by competitors (and the massive clusters that this causes), and if you can get over the questional physics in a(n admittedly) minority of maps, then this game is a fantastic racer.

If you grab it while it's on sale for about $2.50, then the game is a fantastic addition to a gaming library. | Mini Motor Racing EVO has really become a very entertaining racing game.
It's a pleasure to race on the various tracks and the boost provides great help on the track.
The career mode is nicely expanded and every vehicle is worth re-challenging the racecourses!

Check out some gameplay here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQRm5M_G_kM | This is a cute little racer, reminiscent of the Amiga racer All Terrain Racing, that will hit both your pleasure and frustration buttons.  The two major frustrating elements are the collisions that almost always favour the AI racers, and also the lack of progress syncing in between races.  You'd better quit and restart on your own every few races to save your races and your money, because a game or a system crash will obliterate any progress from that session.

As for the game itself, it is a satisfying combination of good driving, tactics, and upgrades that will see you to the finish line.  You'll need more than just a couple of afternoons to make it to the end, and every time you make it past that one difficult course, it feels just great.  A worthwhile purchase if you like small, classic racers."
76561198032898393,1303990,Mini Motor Racing X,0.0,"Indie, Racing",0,"Start with Racing then get the Touring car after completing the Standard Championship. You'll cruise to the finish even on Hard. All you have to do is use Nitro off the starting block and the acceleration and handling will take care of the rest. If you don't, the whole pack will body you and you'll get stuck everywhere. It seems like only the leader really gets the bonus Nitro that spawns on the track.

I liked the different camera views, I mostly did top down but switched to behind view for the last series. I didn't like the player icon that hovers over the car in this view, pretty annoying. 

Races are basically 50 seconds. The handful of maps are nice, and I don't mind going in reverse, but at some point it starts to feel repetitive when the difficulty never gets any harder. At the same time, going for 100% didn't take ages. 

I think the only difference between this and Evo might be the weapons mode. I did just enough to get an achievement, otherwise I ignored it completely. Same with MP, you get splitscreen but the achievements are only for matchmaking.

Definitely play on Hard to keep the heart-rate up. Casual cartoon racing when the mood strikes."

Auf den ersten Blick wirkt Reus unglaublich charmant.

Und das ändert sich auch während des Spielens nicht.
Ausser, dass man sich hin und wieder dabei ertaptt, sich zu wünschen, dass noch mehr Animationen und Wuselfaktoren ihren Weg ins Spiel finden würden.

Hier noch ein Hühnchen mehr, dort ein Fischerbötchen, vielleicht noch ein paar Wettereffekte, Tag & Nachtwechsel, Godrays, Lensflares, ...

Aber für so ein niederländisches Indie-Studio mit nur wenig Manpower (gerade mal 4 Leute) ist das schon sehr stark.
Man sieht eigentlich schon schön auf einen Blick woran es bei der jeweiligen Siedlung/ Stadt so hapert ... oder wo es gut läuft.

Wie bei ""DIE SIEDLER"" oder ""ANNO"" - nur das hier eben riesige Teams dahinter stecken, die ganz andere Effekte reinballern konnten.

Die dreh- und zoombaren Planeten in echter 3D wie bei Populous 3 wäre natürlich auch schick.
Aber auch die 2D Ansicht ist ... naja, wie erwähnt: charmant.

Um was geht es denn nun?

Ist das so eine Art:
- Populous?
- Black & White?
- Dungeon Keeper?
- Dust?

Nope.
Alle diese oberen Spiele sind wahre Götter unter den - nun- Göttersimulationen.

Auch wenn man hier Titanen steuert, die eigene Fähigkeiten haben:
- Löcher graben und Wasser fluten
- Berge anheben und Wüsten schaffen
- Wälder und Sümpfe aus dem Boden zaubern
- Tiere, Pflanzen, Fische, Mineralien, etc. erschaffen
- bestehende Landstücke und Fauna/Flora verbessern, aufleveln...
wird nie eine Göttersimulation alá Populous daraus,

Es gibt quasi keine gegnerischen Entitäten.

Du bist ein Planet und versuchst das Beste aus Dir zu machen.
Das Beste besteht in diesem Fall darin weit fortschrittliche Dörfer und Städte gedeihen zu lassen, die sich nicht gegenseitig an die Gurgel gehen!

Dazu ist Deine gesamte Oberfläche in Parzellen eingeteilt.

Und je nachdem welche Parzelle neben welcher anderen:
- platziert und
- gehegt und
- gebufft und
- generfed und
- entwickelt
wird entstehen andere Synergie- und Kupplungseffekte.

Symbiosen genannt.

Im Grunde wie ein gutes Kartendeck-Legespiel.

Manchmal musste ich schmunzelnd an YU GI OH denken.
Erst spiele ich diese Karte und wenn ich diese andere daneben packe, werte ich die erste auf und wenn ich dann noch diese eine dritte dazu werfe, ändert sich der Effekt auf die beiden anderen und sie werden noch mächtiger.

Wenn die Dörfer und Städte wachsen dann stellen sie Botschafter ab, die Du auf Deine Titanen packst und die dann noch weitere Fähigkeiten freischalten.
Dann kannst Du beispielsweise aus ""normalen"" Tieren ""exotische Tiere"" machen, die dann nicht nur Nahrung, sondern auch Reichtum bringen, usw.

Also bitte KEIN Populous erwarten!

Gunpoint es un juego de puzzles y plataformas, pero con un enfoque más pausado, donde prima la estrategia y el sigilo. Somos Richard Conway, un espía freelance (autónomo) que por casualidad es grabado por las cámaras de seguridad en la escena de un crimen, el asesinato de Selena Delgado. La jefa de esta mujer, Melanie Rooke, se pone en contacto con nosotros para pedirnos que recuperemos la grabación donde aparece el asesino real de su empleada y amiga Selena, chantajeándonos con que de lo contrario, la policía pensará que nosotros somos el asesino. De este modo deberemos infiltrarnos en distintas instalaciones bien vigiladas para hackear diversos dispositivos y obtener información sensible. Sin embargo, poco a poco iremos adentrándonos en una red de conspiraciones mucho más profunda de lo que cabría esperar, donde se ven implicadas las grandes empresas armamentísticas del país y la policía. Por ello, diferentes personajes contactarán con nosotros para reclamar nuestros servicios o pedirnos ayuda con diversos problemas personales, siendo nuestro principal objetivo desenmascarar al verdadero asesino de Selena.

[h2]Jugabilidad / Apartado técnico[/h2]
Gunpoint nos ofrece diferentes misiones de dificultad y complejidad creciente, donde el principal objetivo suele ser colarse en instalaciones fuertemente vigiladas para hackear algún ordenador, robar objetos clave o escuchar conversaciones privadas. Para ello, nuestro espía podrá hacer uso de una gran variedad de gadgets y dispositivos de alta tecnología que harán su labor de infiltración mucho más sencilla. Por un lado, contamos con los pantalones Bullfrog, los cuales nos permiten saltar grandes distancias, noquear a nuestros enemigos o caer desde alturas sorprendentemente altas. Por otro, iremos adquiriendo nuevos aparatos que harán nuestra vida más sencilla, siendo el Crosslink el más importante. Este dispositivo introduce las mecánicas de puzzle al juego, permitiéndonos ver la instalación eléctrica del edificio y “recablear” diferentes aparatos a voluntad, como interruptores, puertas, cámaras de seguridad, lámparas, etc. En cada misión deberemos hacer uso de estas mecánicas para completar las distintas misiones que nos ofrezcan, tratando de cumplir con ciertos parámetros de sigilo, violencia, tiempo, etc., y siendo recompensados económicamente por nuestros servicios para así, hacernos con nueva tecnología.

[h2]Valoración[/h2]
Gunpoint es un juego de puzzles realmente bueno, que sabe introducir las mecánicas de acción y sigilo de una forma muy interesante. Su jugabilidad es muy dinámica, ya que primero nos obliga a observar y pensar tranquilamente cómo vamos a llevar a cabo la misión, decidiendo que aparatos recablear, qué puertas debemos tomar, la ruta de vigilancia que siguen nuestros enemigos, etc., para luego llevar nuestro plan a la acción de forma rápida y limpia, sin ser vistos ni morir en el intento. La forma de abordar cada misión puede ser diferente y creativa, dejando cierto poder de decisión al jugador para tomar distintas rutas o usar diferentes aparatos. Además, también podremos elegir entre varias opciones de diálogo con nuestros clientes, pudiendo modificar el resultado final de la historia. En resumen, un gran juego de puzzles que recomiendo probar y que ofrece entre 6-7 horas de entretenimiento.
Lo salvaría de un incendio! 👨‍🚒👍🔥

With informative tutorials, simple navigation, and an in-game 'help' menu, the game play is clear and easy to understand. Graphics look great and work well on my old laptop computer.
If I were to add to the game, I'd ask for further upgrades in materials and buildings. Once a city has been established, the progress can feel stagnant, as if being left without a goal.
Overall, great purchase. I've gotten twenty fulfilling hours out of this game, and I'm only on my first settlement! | Pretty fun and fairly challenging, especially in the beginning of a run. If you are into city builders and sims, it's worth a try.

If your dream is to build a mega city of thousands of citizen, that probably isn't gonna work, however. The game starts to lag considerably approaching high population (600+). This and the lack of endgame buildings and upgrades does limit what you can do as you cannot really expand endlessly.

The achievements are overall simple, but do take time. Personally got 100% in 60 hours. | Simples, leve, bons mods e os demais são tudo variações deste. | シンプルに楽しめます。
煩わしいレベル制、何々を建築しないと何々を建築できない。といった物が無いので、ある程度序盤から好き勝手できますし、
そこまで理解が深くなくても、ある程度迷わずにプレイできる。
シンプルなので非常にわかりやすいです。
自分はある程度序盤から好き勝手に、自分好みの街を建築したいので、コレ系のゲームでは一番刺さりました。
ただ、他のゲームと比べやれる事が少なく、ここにはこの物資のみを補完しておく。といったような指定ができない為、
そういった細部まで整理したい人はmodを入れる事をお勧めします。
入れると一気にやれる事が増えて混乱しますがｗ

シンプルにわかりやすい街づくりをしたい方には刺さるのでないでしょうか？ | Straight forward city builder, very relaxing music, all around good game to put a few hundred hours into."

76561198032898393,860950,Mark of the Ninja: Remastered,0.0,"Action, Indie",0,"是欧美刻板印象风格的立本忍者，基本上全程都得潜行，潜行失败惩罚比较大，不容易进入狂战士模式。
动画很流畅，难度可调，角色性能比较强。
打折价可以买来玩玩，很传统的暗杀类游戏。
就是操作方面爬墙和一些平台上下移动操作逻辑有点不顺手。
剧情你完全可以不看，把能看到的杀光就行，当然有些任务目标要留到过年杀。 | Una joyita, buen gameplay, buen arte, buenas mecanicas, muy buena historia 10/10 | Simplesmente épico. Stealth feito como deve ser. Você morre pelo seu erros e aprende com isso. Tempo de duração ideal | Mark of the Ninja: Remastered is an absolute masterclass in stealth gameplay, blending fluid movement, strategic decision-making, and a beautifully stylized presentation into one of the best 2D stealth experiences ever made. Whether you're a stealth game veteran or a newcomer to the genre, this game is a must-play.

The controls are incredibly smooth and responsive, allowing you to sneak, climb, and take down enemies with precision. Every movement feels intentional, and the game gives you complete control over how you approach each level—whether you choose to remain completely unseen or take down every enemy methodically. The variety of tools and abilities at your disposal, from distraction items to lethal assassination techniques, ensures that every encounter feels dynamic.

The level design is superb, offering multiple paths, secret areas, and creative ways to eliminate or avoid enemies. The game rewards patience and planning, but it never feels punishing, thanks to generous checkpointing and intuitive mechanics that encourage experimentation.

The hand-drawn art style is stunning, with smooth animations and striking lighting effects that emphasize the importance of shadows and visibility. The sound design is equally impressive, using audio cues to enhance the tension and make sneaking through levels even more immersive.

The remastered edition polishes an already fantastic game, improving textures, animations, and adding higher fidelity visuals while maintaining the game’s signature aesthetic. The inclusion of the Special Edition content, which adds an extra level and developer commentary, makes it an even better package.

With its brilliant stealth mechanics, engaging progression system, and stylish presentation, Mark of the Ninja: Remastered is an essential title for anyone who enjoys tactical, skill-based gameplay.

Rating: 9.5/10 – One of the best stealth games ever made, now even better. | Mark of the Ninja’s core strengths and weaknesses largely stem from the same source. MOTN is a pretty simple game on the mechanical side, taking most of the core features of other stealth games and condensing them into a 2d environment. This approach has its benefits –there’s a much greater degree of visual clarity for environments and enemies and players are less likely to be screwed over by weird physics issues– but it also limits what the game is capable of.

Having access to so much information reduces tension and the enemies aren’t observant enough to balance things out. Meanwhile, navigating a 2d space is far simpler than a 3d one making traversal through the levels feel a lot less varied compared to other major stealth titles as there are few unconventional or hidden approaches that it's possible to take. It makes for a game that’s quite easy to learn and pick up (good considering its short runtime) but with a low skill ceiling. I played nonlethally and with none of the optional abilities but still managed to get max rank on nearly every level without much difficulty.

The picture is the same when looking at MOTN’s stealth mechanics. There’s a decent variety of items and abilities you can use to supplement your starting kit, but aside from the tutorial sections where they’re introduced none of these additions are required or even feel well-integrated with the rest of the gameplay. Rather than expanding how you can approach the game, they feel more like a means of bypassing challenges entirely.

If you’re struggling to sneak past a guard, you can lure them away with a distraction or temporarily blind them with a flash grenade. If you come across a laser trap, rather than finding a way around it or disabling the trap by finding its power source, you could also just toss a smoke bomb which disables the lasers until the smoke dissipates. For a game that's already quite easy, the upgrades far outpace the increased difficulty of the enemies and levels such that MOTN gets easier rather than harder the further your progress until you’re near the very end of the game. Most of the ways the game gets more difficult (stronger enemies in particular) don’t even come into play if you’re sneaky enough not to get caught so there’s very little added challenge between the beginning and the mid/late game. 

There is a decent foundation here, but it's clearly lacking. The only way to get more variety is to sacrifice difficulty, meanwhile the base game never feels so hard that bypassing the challenges ever felt necessary or even desirable. For any semi-skilled player you’ll essentially be playing the whole game with nothing but the tools you get at the very start plus one ability that unlocks near the end. And while the enemy placements and level design are good enough that the limited toolset is still enjoyable to use, once you start to learn the patterns and get a feel for how the designers intend for you to solve something, it's not hard to actually execute it.

But while I complain that MOTN is too easy overall, it still has some elements that feel quite unfair to deal with and make some portions of the game needlessly difficult or frustrating to deal with. There’s a heavy emphasis on sticking to the shadows to avoid detection, but at the same time the game does a poor job at distinguishing between light and dark areas. Your current position is easy to tell –when standing in light your character will be in full color, but when in the dark they’ll only be pictured in black and white– but when moving to another spot it can be hard to tell, especially in outdoor areas. A spot can look bright but not be considered bright enough that you can be detected in them (or vice versa, but to a lesser extent). While in the darkness, enemies can only see you when you’re in their vision cone but if you’re in the light they can see from wherever they’re standing as long as they’re facing the correct way. So stepping into the light can easily be a death sentence but without a reliable way of distinguishing between the two it places an unnecessary amount of risk onto any player movements, encouraging you to take alternate routes that are more certain but also more boring.

There are a few frustrating technical issues as well. Checkpoints were handled quite poorly, sometimes respawning me directly into an enemy’s line of light and forcing me to either continue with the alarm raised or restart the whole level. Controls were also awkward when playing with Keyboard+Mouse as the game would sometimes disregard my mouse and give me the Keyboard prompt for something instead (Entering a hiding spot, for example, is E on the keyboard or right click on the mouse, but if I walked up to it using WASD then the game prompted me to use E since it recognizes I’m using a keyboard instead of right click since I still have a mouse). And the game binds too many actions to each key with many interactions (moving/dropping a body, entering a hiding spot, pulling a switch, etc) all using the same prompt which often meant doing something I didn’t intend because the game changed what it was indicating my button press would do at the last second.

And just to mention it, the story is fine. It’s serviceable as a way of contextualizing your actions but it's pretty simple and predictable so there isn’t any reason to get invested.

MOTN is still a decent game and I recommend it if you just want to kill a few hours. It has enough going on to keep you invested in the moment-to-moment without ever being overwhelming and, while hardly compared to the genre’s greats, the stealth mechanics are fun to engage with. It’s hardly a game that will stick in my mind for too long but I don’t regret my time with it.

Permadeath is super annoying in a co-op. Losing all your progress and then playing through the exact same dungeon again is super demotivating. We tried playing with infinite lives, but then it trivialized the game -- there was no penalty at all for death.

Also, the fact that every player controls every menu simultaneously led to a let of misclicks. My partner opened a vendor while I was attacking things, and my button press bought something for them. Worse, later they paused the game while I was attacking things, and my button press quit the game. There wasn't even an ""are you sure?"" dialog, it just immediately quit and we lost everything.

Сначала вы работаете в гараже, потом — в роскошном офисе, а между этим изобретаете шедевры вроде «симулятора гонок с элементами РПГ».

Игра радует юмором и ностальгией по эпохам игровой индустрии. Но геймплей быстро превращается в рутину: исследуй, разрабатывай, публикуй. Через пару часов начинаешь ощущать себя настоящим разработчиком — уставшим и в отчаянии.

Оценка: 6,5/10 — неплохое развлечение на вечер, но глубины и разнообразия не хватает. Идеально для тех, кто хочет попробовать, каково это — разрабатывать игры (спойлер: сложно). | Went bankrupt when trying to make Concord like Sony. 100% accurate simulator. | The game is Okey, but lacks depts.
It would have been fun for the game making process to be deep with a lot of complicated variable.
Instead, it feels very generic, to the point were the optimal solution is akin to a formula.
For example, you try to make military game? Action is a good type choice.
Seek a console that makes good Action type games, and allocate your resource acording to the ACTION type games.
Yes... That's right, all action type games are all basically the same, you just need to find an approriate theme and a good work ratio for Graphics, Gameplay, Dialogues, AI, Audio, etc. FOR ALL ACTION TYPE GAMES.
So what if it's a shooter, a platformer, a music bit-mania type game, everything is the same if it's an action type game...
This makes the game overly simplistic, and frankly, a bit lazy in its design.
You shouldn't put all Action games, Strategy games, RPGs, Simulations games, and Adventure games into the same bucket. Shooters and Platformers are both Action games, but they are very different in their nature, and they are likely appreciated in different platforms.
Btw, PCs in this game are not the best for actions games, but in reality, they are the best for First Person Shooters, but not as good for other action games like platformers fighting games.
TLDR: I didn't like the game because it is a bit too generic, lacks real dept, and doesn't make sense in a real world context. | A really fun and engaging tycoon game. It encourages you to try different genres together and feels like you're in the game development/console race golden age. |

Anomaly Korea es una expansión exclusiva del conocido Anomaly: Warzone Earth, un juego de estrategia en tiempo real que le da la vuelta al sistema Tower Defense tradicional, convirtiéndolo en un “Tower Offense”. Nosotros controlaremos un escuadrón de vehículos militares que deberán abrirse paso a través de calles plagadas de estructuras alienígenas. Tras la batalla de Baghdad, las fuerzas enemigas han vuelto más fuertes. En esta ocasión, la misión tendrá lugar en Seúl (Corea del Sur). Deberemos atravesar la ciudad cumpliendo diversas misiones de destrucción de objetivos, escolta o rescate, tratando de buscar la manera de pararle los pies a las fuerzas extraterrestres y expulsarlos de una vez por todas de nuestro planeta.

[h2]Jugabilidad / Apartado técnico[/h2]
El juego mantiene la misma esencia y mecánicas que el original. Dispondremos de 12 misiones de campaña, en las cuales desplegaremos nuestro escuadrón de vehículos, cada uno con una serie de habilidades ofensivas y defensivas. Deberemos recorrer diversos escenarios, eligiendo la ruta que seguirá nuestro convoy de manera eficiente, minimizando daños y destruyendo las torres enemigas. Conforme avancemos iremos recogiendo fondos con los que ampliar nuestro arsenal de vehículos, debiendo posicionarlos dentro del convoy de manera que se protejan los unos a los otros. Volvemos a disponer de un set de 4 habilidades o potenciadores (reparación, señuelo, camuflaje y bombardeo), cuyo uso adecuado será imprescindible para sobrevivir.
Además, el juego incluye 6 misiones especiales, Art of War, que nos harán enfrentarnos a retos especiales. El juego añade muy pocas cosas nuevas con respecto al original: una ligera mejora gráfica, nuevas misiones, un vehículo nuevo (Tanque Horangi) y una nueva torre enemiga (Lanzallamas).

[h2]Valoración[/h2]
Al tratarse de una expansión del original, Anomaly Korea está pensado para aquellos que disfrutaron de Anomaly: Warzone Earth y se quedaron con ganas de más. Básicamente es un juego idéntico, en cuando a mecánicas y estrategia, pero se nota la intención de añadir objetivos más variados y giros inesperados en medio de las misiones, lo que hacen de este título una versión mejorada. Recomiendo probarlo, pues sigue siendo una opción estupenda para los amantes de la estrategia y los juegos de defensa de torres.

Lo salvaría de un incendio! 👨‍🚒👍🔥

Puis un jour, arriva une entreprise extrémiste pro-capitalisme, nommé Epic Games, qui décida de mettre le jeu gratuit, et changa le système des RLCS. Au début la première saison commençait bien, puis au début de la 2éme saison, Epic Games pense que c'est une bonne idée de baisser le MMR de tout les ranks du jeu et les serveurs commencèrent a être cataclysmique. Toute la communauté du jeu se plaignent mais Epic Games préfèrent mettre du caca dans leur oreilles pour ne pas écouter les idées de la communauté. Les problèmes de smurfing, serveurs et d'autre n'étaient toujours pas réglé par ces gérants frauduleux de Rocket League, le jeu mourrait de + en + rapidement. Puis un jour, vers 2022, on découvre que les serveurs peuvent être DDOS très facilement, comme si la sécurité a été mis en place par une équipe pakistanais/indien. La ranked était INJOUABLE, surtout dans les hauts élos, il y avait des DDOSEURS quasi à toute nos games. Les streameurs et joueurs signalent le problème horrible à Epic Games mais ces foutu chômeurs prenaient 3semaines a bannent les DDOSEURS. Puis quelque semaines après, une faille dans le jeu a été découvert afin d’être invisible pendant les parties, encore un autre problème montrant le travail HORRIBLE fait par ces extrémistes pro-capitalisme (ils ont pris 2mois a patch ce cheat et encore c'était la commu qui avaient trouvé un patch avant les developpeurs). Le DDOS était toujours pas patch, les joueurs pro en avait marre et le leaderboard n'avait plus aucun sens. Il y avait aussi le problème du wintrading (chose qui n'est toujours pas patch aujourd'hui donc n'importe qui peut être SSL s'il veut), des gens montaient des comptes a 3000MMR (j'en faisais parti honnêtement) et les serveurs de boosting utilisant le wintrade etaient de + en + nombreux. Les RLCS étaient donc de moins en moins regardé car le jeu était NUL, beaucoup de gens arrête le jeu à cause d'une dépression forte causé par Epic Games. Aujourd'hui, le 19/01/2025, le jeu est sur le bord de la fin, on a aucune idée de quand va sortir Unreal Engine 5 pour RL, et aucune bonne mise a jour sort depuis plusieurs mois. J'espère un meilleur avenir pour ce jeu qui étaient historique.

Excerpt from Steam community forum:

Hey guys, I have the solution for all of you who are told by the EPIC website that your email is already registered.

In my case I have the same email on Steam and Epic so I got this error.
Some friends suggested that I change my email by putting a period. For example if your address is mailrocket@gmail.com on the Epic validation website you should put mail.rocket@gmail.com

That way they sent me the verification code to my usual email account.
Then I entered it in the EPIC web registration again and it gave me an error but then the screen refreshed, the terms and conditions appeared, I accepted and I was able to play Rocket League.

It has that claustrophobic, creeping horror feel of the first Alien movie.

It's been out for a long, long time now, but routinely [i]still[/i] gets updates. It's stable as a rock - I've never experienced any bugs or crashes, and it's always been smooth to play even on lower-end hardware.

The procedural nature of the galaxy creation for each run makes for a good bit of variety. And, I find myself getting attached to my little drones.

コマンドラインインタフェース（CLI）か手動操作でドローンを操作して、宇宙に放棄された数多の難破船を探索するゲームです。
いい雰囲気のゲームではありますが、単調といえば単調なため、合わない方もいらっしゃるかもしれません。
セールで買った値段だとかなりお得に感じました。
ゲームを遊ぶ上で読まないといけない部分は非常に簡単な英語で構成されています。

探索中の難破船の船体がｷﾞｷﾞｷﾞｷﾞ...という軋み音、コンソールから発せられる注意の音や警告音で焦らされ、接敵時に滅茶苦茶ビビらされ、のんびり探索してたらドアをこじ開けられたりベントから侵入されたり放射線に晒されたりします。
慌てて判断ミスをするとドローンが半壊/壊滅して大惨事になるゲームです。
面白いけど怖いのが苦手な人間からすると心臓に悪い。

探索するフロアはドアロックで区切られており、行きたい部屋に敵がいないか確認しながら探索を進めます。
部屋が安全そうであればCLIで操作し、次の部屋の情報が不明であったりした場合は手動操作に切り替えて様子を見るなどして進めます。

探索パートでは、如何にして手持ちの装備で敵をかいくぐりながら物資を集めてゆくかを熟考しながら進めます。
但し、探索する船が年季の入った宇宙船なのであれば、生物の根城にされていたり船が壊れそうになっていたりと危険が一杯です。
例えば
・ベントから敵が侵入
・ドアをこじ開けて敵が侵入
・船が劣化してエアロックが破損してリークが発生
など。
そのため、慎重且つスピーディな探索を要求されます。

CLIに慣れてくると全てのドローンを効率よく作業させられるようになるため、探索スピードが上がり自身の成長を感じられます。
また、aliasもあるので、よく使うコマンドや誤入力するコマンドは登録しておくとより効率的で快適な探索が可能となります。

 | This is one of my favorite games.  Equal parts frustrating and addictive.  They hit the theme 100% on the head; I feel like I'm alone in the big dark of the Aliens movies.  Very gritty, very real.  At its heart it's a puzzle and programming game.  You can move your little drones manually, but programming them to do their stuff is mandatory; there's even a meta batch file where you can create subroutines -- and you'll need 'em.  I love that it's programming in 2 different ways: first, the straight-up coding of getting your little dudes to do what they do; second, the programming of utilizing all of their skills appropriately to survive.  Tack on an awesome dark, lonely space theme and some very cool lore (which you discover as you go) and you've got a super fun game that I highly recommend! | nice little game for cheap with a eery but not spooky athmosphere | Atmospheric.

Of course, you need to take it easy and not take any of the narrator's comments personally, as the game constantly makes fun of you. And I guess that’s why everyone loves it - ignoring the narrator’s words and having fun messing with each other. Sometimes, it’s crazy how well the scripting is done, allowing you to make different choices and still receive a unique response. This isn’t your typical walking simulator, especially with cool achievements like keeping the game on for an entire Tuesday (yes, 24 hours straight...) or not playing for five years and then coming back.

　グラフィックは画面がヤケクソに暗いうえ懐中電灯が眩しすぎるという、リアルとか恐怖とかいうよりもとにかく目が疲れるインディーゲーあるあるなクソ迷惑仕様で、タスク進行は説明が曖昧で次にやるべきことがわからない。ステージ終盤でなんやかや色々やった末に「やった！これで助かった！」としか書かれず次に何をすべきかわからない状況で一定時間が過ぎると「救助に間に合わなかった…」と敗北宣告されたりする。おまえは一体なにを言っているんだ。プレイヤーにやらせたいことが開発者の脳内で自己完結しているため、なんかもう色々と端折られすぎていて意味不明なのである。
　戦闘は武器の当たり判定が曖昧でどこに当たったのやら感覚が掴めず、武器弾薬の数が限られているうえに特定の進行状況に達すると敵が露骨に無限湧きする迷惑仕様。L4Dのような撃ちまくり系のバランスではないにも関わらず、MAPやモードによってはゾンビがL4Dのように大群となって押しよせてくる。数が多いのもそうだが、倒した先から追加でおかわりが登場する有り様で、湧くスピードが不自然に早過ぎる。当然のことながら、プレイヤーの数に合わせて敵の数や難易度を調整するような神経をこのゲームは持ち合わせていない。
　しかもゾンビどもは全力疾走しながらも足音を立てずいつの間にか隣に立ってぶん殴って来るというニンジャぶりを発揮してくるので（本作はサウンドデザインがまったく良くない）、難しいとかいうより「ああ、開発者はプレイヤーを殺すことしか考えてないんだな」と理不尽を覚える、購入とプレイを後悔する疲労がじんわりと額に広がる瞬間である。
　良い点はといえばマイナーな火器が多数登場するところ、SIG SPやマニューリンなどは他のゲームで滅多に見ることはないためつい使ってしまう。ただ先述のように銃弾のヒット感がなく手ごたえがない、おまけに命中精度が異様に低く、アサルトライフルなどは赤ん坊の小便のように弾が散らばり10m先の標的さえまともに射抜けない。さらに密着するとこちらの攻撃が当たらず敵から一方的に殴られるという駄目ゲーあるあるな残念仕様である。総じて戦闘はまったく面白くない。
　率直に言って、このゲームを友達とプレイしたいとは思わない。そんなことをしたら俺は嫌われ者になってしまうよ。 | O jogo se encontra com vários bugs, quando jogado co-op só piora.

Você passa um bom tempo jogando como se ele fosse um jogo qualquer, quando na verdade o rumo que se deve ter é completamente diferente. Darkest Dungeon é uma das minhas experiências mais difíceis que eu tive nos últimos anos com jogos. A jogabilidade é extremamente punitiva, nociva caso não saiba o que está fazendo. Um dos núcleos do jogo, é o dinheiro. É necessário entrar nas missões (dungeons), se importar com fazer dinheiro, sua sobrevivência e ainda completar o seu objetivo. Conciliar todos esses fatores, transforma a experiência em um ciclo maçante de fazer dinheiro e upar personagens para o final do jogo. Penso que essa ferramenta utilizada para ser a ponte principal do Darkest Dungeon, pode ser bem mal vista para quem pensa em zerar o jogo.

Mas, além de tudo, gostaria de enaltecer a arte característica e virtuosa, que transmite perfeitamente a atmosfera obscura das dungeons, da sofrência e do medo. A direção artística voltada ao tema ""Lovecrafteana"", é muito bem feito, principalmente no que se diz progressão visual. Os ambientes se tornando mais medonhas cada vez que você vai progredindo para o final do jogo, a mudança de cores voltadas ao cosmo e carnificina ou até mesmo as músicas que passam de um violino arranhado e agitado para algo mais ""contemplador""

Por fim, vai minha dica:
- Se você quiser uma experiência menos massiva, jogue na dificuldade Radiante
- Caso queira sofrer um pouco mais, tendo que repetir missões para ficar mais forte, jogue na Mais Escura
- E se você for um mutante, jogue na mais difícil mesmo, é uma experiência semelhante a estar em um quarto branco com camisa de força no corpo | 新手上手不难，甚至比月计还简单一些，风格也熟悉，各位主管，司书，管理员必入 | This is a game I played on an off for years, and both loved it and grew frustrated by it as I played.  This last year I decided it was time to beat the game finally, so I dedicated a bit more of my gaming time to it, and feel I can give some fairly informed thoughts on the game.  

Darkest Dungeon has a fun party management system that is well designed and the heart and soul of the game.  Do you select your ranged skills for your Highwayman so he can be in position 3?  Or do you take his pos 1/2 skills and play more of a high risk high reward style of play up front?  Do you put your jester in the back making him a buffing character?  Or do you put him further forward so you can apply bleed and be more of a DPS character?  It allows you to make a lot of different parties in different ways, and as you play you learn what combo's works best for each situation, and which ones you prefer to play.  

The enemies also have positions that work differently for each enemy type, and some of your characters will let you manipulate the positions of your enemies to mess them up or put them in a position for one of your other characters to pummel them into the dirt.   So overall the game play is EXCELLENT.

Where I had my struggles with the game was losing characters.  When I first started playing the game it really hurt to lose that Leper that I had been using effectively for so many dives into the dungeon.  I eventually learned that dying is an important aspect of the game, and if you upgrade your stagecoach you will be just fine.  The death of the characters also adds weight to your decisions in the game.  If you decide to get too crazy with a party/skill composition there is a very real chance you are going to lose some of your characters.  So if you decide to play Darkest dungeon just accept right off the bat that death is part of the grim dark theme of the game.

The other aspect of the game that people may not like is the tone and atmosphere of the game.  It is a grim dark themed horror game.  Horror is not really my jam to be honest, but the game play and how the theme is executed, and the great narration of the game drew me in despite my lack of interest in the horror genre.  

Overall the game play is excellent, and the setting, style and art of the game is unique and intriguing.  I would highly recommend this to people looking for a great rogue like dungeon crawler that stands out in an over crowded market."

Excellent jeu, probablement le meilleur jeu du survie qui existe juste devant DayZ.

Les graphismes peuvent faire peur quand on y a pas encore joué, mais une fois dedans l'immersion est totale.

Vous voyez, les éditeurs font un peu la course à celui qui proposera le jeu avec les plus beaux graphismes.
Mais bien souvent au détriment du gameplay.

Là c'est tout l'inverse, les graphismes sont moins poussés (bien que tout a fait originaux)
Mais le gameplay est vraiment excellent. 

Et qu'est ce qui différence un bon jeu d'un mauvais jeu ?  Le gameplay tout simplement.

 | Project Zomboid is the game where you realize your survival instincts are far less impressive than you thought. You start with a backpack full of dreams and a baseball bat, and within 20 minutes, you’re barricading yourself in a house while panicking over a can of beans you can’t open cause the can opener was ""too heavy"".

The game is like a masterclass in poor decision-making—deciding to fight a horde of zombies because ""I’m pretty sure I can take them"" is immediately followed by the sound of your character screaming and a death screen. But hey, at least you can loot your own body afterwards, right?

If you want a realistic survival experience, where every bad decision is rewarded with even worse consequences, Project Zomboid has you covered. 10/10 would die in my own garden again. | Great immersive game where you're going to die at some point

Compared to other very grindy Lego games I've played in the past, this was a nice easy-going game to play for a little bit. 


Here is a list of bugs I ran into and what I did to resolve the issues:

Level 1 - (Free play) Unable to enter the dance mini-game. I got it to work by having no extras turned on and building both speakers while playing as the original level characters (Emmet and Gail).

Level 3 - (Story) When needing to attack the 4 robots in the alley, 1 of them got stuck behind an unbreakable door. Had to replay the level multiple times until I was able to kill him through the wall.

Level 4 - (Free play) On the last area where you're getting chased, I was going the opposite direction around the track so I was unable to destroy the 3 caravans for the last gold manual of the level. Had to just keep replaying the level until I was going in the correct direction.

Level 7 - (Both story & Free play) Cut scene soft locks because Abraham Lincoln falls off the edge. Had to turn VSync on to fix this.

Bonus Room: When driving the little car, game lagged very badly which made the car gold brick not optainable. Had to turn VSync to the 30Hz option to make the car not lag.

Additionally, I somehow managed to get a character stuck a handful of times.


Overall, the game is fun and I'd give it like a 7/10. If it wasn't for so many bugs I experienced I would've rated it higher. Buy the game when it's on sale and you can get it for a low price of $2. Typical Lego game so it's fun for any age to play. I do not recommend buying the 2nd Lego Movie Video game. That game is quite poor and no way comparable to this one. | so many memories related to this game! i owned it growing up on the ps3, and it was my favorite. getting the chance to play it again 100% was a nostalgic space of time and it still is as good as i remember | This game runs smoothly on modern computers and Windows 11. The replayability of this game is very high because there are a lot of things to find and to unlock even after you have completed the story mode. | Pra mim é um jogo muito nostálgico já que joguei muito quando era mais novo. Mesmo sendo um jogo de lego mais antigo, recomendo muito pra quem gosta de lego. A história é muito boa e engraçada. Amo esse jogo e tô doido pra jogar o 2 que não joguei até hoje. | Arguably one of the weakest Lego games I've ever played.  Fraught with bugs, worse graphics than even the first LEGO Star Wars game, and some bizarre choices when it comes to the games cutscenes (recording new voices and changing the music, rather than just straight grabbing the whole scene from the movie).  An overall OKAY game with most of my limited praise going to much of music.  I wouldn't recommend it unless it goes on sale, and even then that's a small recommendation."
76561198032898393,268130,Heat Signature,7.583333333333333,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Strategy",18,"A lot of games that are heavily based around systems and emergent gameplay fall somewhat flat for me because doing things in wacky ways feels somewhat pointless beyond ""lol you can just drop a big rock on the enemies"" or whatever.

Heat Signature is a case of a game in which the standard stuff that you get shown in the tutorial is and lots of fun by itself (it's hotline miami by way of FTL) but the act of exploiting the game's systems is also both intuitive and wildly effective. The game really clicks when you get on a big ship to assassinate someone, see the 40 people with shields between you and them, and decide instead to go hijack a different ship alltogether to shoot some holes into the former so you can dock right next to your target. Despite the relatively simplistic designs of the procedurally generated ships, there's tons of variety from mission to mission, and I keep discovering new things despite the fact that the game doesn't actually unlock much and progression is just new mission types or getting to buy certain item types instead of having to find them.

Anyway, it's lots of fun, you should play it. | It's good as far as what you get from it. The game progresses by getting more high end gadgets that let you take on enemies who will be invincible otherwise. You can generally classic stealth to a point but enemy contractors will make you play more seat of your pants. There's a few types of missions, and the enjoyment of the game is from going in to a hard mission and trying to win.

Balancing your inventory between weapons and gadgets is part of the game. You pick up a lot of stuff and you need to use it to win.

Understand that this is not a progression quest, the end game isn't that great and if you aren't enjoying it you should stop playing. The actual payoff is the defector missions where you get a bit of cool equipment and try to do a hard mission. i.e, the reward for playing the game is playing the game. | Un exellent jeu au gameplay très riche permettant tout type d'approches aux missions.

I really enjoyed the problem solving, and scenario planning aspect of the game.  It is a ton of fun to play, once you figure it out, and this is where this game falls down, in guiding new players.  

I would highly recommend new players to not shun character guides and other online resources to get going.  This is a ten year old game and I think they purposefully designed the game around ""discovery"" mechanics (especially around character skill progression and item effects) so you learn by doing,  Which I think would be fine if you unlocked something that documented the information for you so if you step away for a few weeks you don't forget.  I find myself wasting resources to ""find out"" what something does only to have forgotten even later in the play through. 

Personally I think if this game underwent a UX/UI cleanup, slightly better tutorialization of some of the mechanics and better information persistance you could re-release this game today and it would attract a huge following. | OK game. Would be awesome without the following two issues. First, the game occasionally CTDs between floors and deletes the autosave (the only allowed save) in the process - so game over. Secondly, large monster waves are a big blob of moving pixels. It is almost impossible to tell which monsters and how many are attacking your heroes. Looks ugly too. I do not get why people like pixel art in this game. Pixel art was not a choice but a necessity back in the day. The best old pixel art (e.g. Prince of Persia, Lemmings) also looked way better than this hot mess. | Addictive, good looking, funny, rogue type game that makes you utilize brain and try it in different play modes.

9/10

Cons - sometimes it is too dependent on random elements. | Simply one of my favorite games of all time. DoTE is a fun little tower defense that can be played solo or with a group (up to four players.) There is quite a few characters to unlock with their own unique play styles and abilities. The difficulty levels are a bit of satire “easy” is quite damn hard, it’s extremely challenging to finish the dungeon. Where as “too easy” is well, just that after you get the hang of things, still a fairly good challenge starting out and later on with the different launch pods you unlock after successful playthroughs. FIDS resources are the same as other endless games. If you enjoy resource management and tower defense you should love this. | Не цікава, не весела, цілком порожня гра із високим порогом входження.

Bioshock 2 é uma sequência muito mais que digna do primeiro jogo, além de dar um upgrade na jogabilidade, continua a entregar um enredo envolvente com uma história profunda e que levanta reflexões desta vez mostrando o outro extremo, contrário ao ideal individualista de Andrew Ryan.

A must play for those who finished the first game and a good game to enjoy. | To put simply: my favorite video game of all time.

The first Bioshock is a great game, but it isn’t perfect. It suffers from odd level design and a messy final act. But despite its short development time, Bioshock 2 takes everything great about the first game and streamlines it. Gone are the old PC-era RPG elements and bullet-spongy bosses. The way research works in this game promotes more variety in gunplay, pushing players to try plasmid and weapon combos they might normally not. This makes 2 extremely replayable.

The story here elaborates on a small but important part of Bioshock: the Big Daddies and Little Sisters. Putting you in the shoes of an “old-school” Daddy that supposedly existed before the events of the first game, Delta somehow manages to help us feel so much more than Jack ever did.

Our relationship with Eleanor is moving and organic. Lamb feels like a great successor villain-wise to the loud and proud Ryan. Bioshock 2's story is weirdly similar to Neon Genesis Evangelion, but with a Socialism-fearing American twist. Through themes of fatherhood battling unrighteous use of equality and unity, our actions feel much more fleshed out than the black-and-white “choice” in Bioshock (which is ironic considering that game’s main message). This game makes your choices feel like they really matter.

2 abandons a plot twist and a final boss to focus more on its spectrum of endings, which feel natural based on our choices and their influence. If Delta is good, Eleanor becomes good. If Delta is evil, Eleanor becomes evil. If Delta made mixed/nonsensical choices, Eleanor becomes broken and confused. This is especially great with how thought-provoking some of the choices are: like does Gil deserve to live, or should he be mercy-killed as he previously asked? Not to forget the Mark Meltzer subplot, which is its own whole fascinating journey that was originally revealed through an ARG before 2 released.

The multiplayer is pretty great despite how often people cite it as feeling ""tacked on."" Clearly a decent amount of love was put into it, even if it is unbalanced (all you need is Electro Bolt and the damage-upgraded crossbow).

This was my first Bioshock game, but I think even if I had played the first game first, I’d know that this is the better game. And probably the greatest shooter of all time.""

As the story unfolds, players are thrust into a world of political intrigue, social unrest, and philosophical exploration, with themes ranging from American exceptionalism to the nature of reality itself.

One of the standout features of ""BioShock Infinite"" is its narrative complexity. The plot takes unexpected twists, keeping players on their toes as they navigate the layers of conspiracy and mystery. Booker and Elizabeth’s relationship evolves in a compelling way, and their dynamic drives much of the emotional weight of the story. Elizabeth herself is a unique character, not only because of her abilities—such as opening ""tears"" in space-time—but also because of her depth and growth throughout the game. The bond between Booker and Elizabeth becomes central to the experience, and the way the game unfolds keeps the player invested in their journey.

The world of Columbia is incredibly well-crafted, with vibrant, meticulously detailed environments that stand in stark contrast to the darker themes of the game. The floating city feels like a living, breathing entity, with its own history, culture, and class divides. The design of Columbia, from its patriotic aesthetic to its underlying dystopian nature, provides a striking commentary on American society and the consequences of unchecked nationalism. The game's use of music, especially the incorporation of old-timey renditions of modern songs, further enhances the atmosphere and immersion.

Gameplay-wise, ""BioShock Infinite"" is engaging and intense. The shooting mechanics are fluid, and the introduction of the Skyhook, which allows players to move across railways in the air, adds a unique verticality to the combat. The combination of gunplay, strategic use of Vigors (special powers), and Elizabeth’s ability to open tears creates a dynamic combat system that requires both quick reflexes and tactical thinking. The game encourages exploration, rewarding players with lore, upgrades, and narrative elements that deepen the story.

However, it’s not just the gameplay and world-building that make ""BioShock Infinite"" stand out; it’s also the philosophical depth. The game delves into complex topics like free will, the multiverse theory, and the nature of identity. It challenges players to think critically about the choices they make in the game and how those choices relate to broader existential questions. The ending, in particular, leaves a lasting impact, providing both a satisfying conclusion and a thought-provoking meditation on fate and the consequences of one’s actions.

""BioShock Infinite"" is a masterpiece that blends excellent gameplay with a deep, engaging story. Its themes of freedom, oppression, and the complexity of human nature are explored in a way that feels both personal and universal. The game’s vibrant world, memorable characters, and intricate narrative make it one of the most thought-provoking and visually stunning games of its generation. While it may not appeal to every player, those who appreciate a game that challenges both the mind and the skills will find ""BioShock Infinite"" to be an unforgettable experience.

 [b] 2007 yılında GOTY kazanmış bir oyunla karşı karşıyayız. Tabii ki bu remastered versiyonu yani günümüz ses efektlerine ve grafiklerine ayak uydurabilen hali.[/b]

[h3] Hikâye ve Arka Plan: [/h3]
Oyunun hikayesi, kaliteli bir roman gibi oyuncuyu içine çekiyor. 1960'larda bir uçak kazası sonrası okyanusun ortasında hayatta kalıyoruz, kazanın yaşandığı yerde olan deniz fenerine gitmemiz ile okyanusun altında olan distopik şehir Rapture ile tanışıyoruz. Sözde Ryan'ın '' bireycilik ve özgürlük '' vaadiyle yarattığı bu şehir, kısa süre içerisinde kaosa yenik düşüyor. İnsan doğasının karanlık yanlarını sorgulatan, kapitalizm ve sosyalizm gibi felsefi temaları harmanlayan bir hikâyeye sahip. Özellikle sonlara doğru “Would you kindly?” gibi şok edici bir olayla hikayeye başka bir anlam katıyor. Kısaca karşımızda düşünülmüş ve kaliteli bir hikaye var.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3409545052
[h3] Ses Tasarımı: [/h3]
Ses tasarımı konusunda hiç üzmeyen bir yapım kendisi. Savaştığımız yaratıklar yani splicer'ların ürkütücü fısıldamaları, sesleri ve konuşmaları vs olsun, Big Daddy'lerin metalik homurtaları, yürüyüşleri ve Rapture'un su altı atmosferindeki derin yankılar vesaire olsun başarılı olmuş. Ses tasarımı oyunun atmosferini bir üst seviyeye çıkarıyor.

[h3] Grafik ve Tasarım: [/h3]
Oyunun ilk dakikasından da anlayabildiğimiz gibi grafikleri güzel ve yeterli. Genel olarak aydınlatma ve doku detaylarıyla güzel bir izlenim bırakıyor. Eski versiyonuna göre su efektleri olsun, karakter modellemeleri olsun kısaca geliştirebildikleri her şeyi geliştirmişler ve remastered adına uygun hale getirmişler. Genel olarak 2007'deki versiyonun kaliteli hali olduğunu unutmazsak, Rapture'un art deco mimarisi ve retro-fütüristik tasarımı, zamanın ötesinde bir iş olduğunu hatırlatıyor. 

art deco ve retro-fütüristik tasarımdan kısaca bahsetmek gerekirse şöyle;

art deco: 1920'lerin ihtişamını ve modernizmi yansıtan, geometrik formlar ve lüks materyallerle bezenmiş bir estetik anlayışıdır. Bu tarz, zarif simetriler, parlak yüzeyler ve egzotik desenlerle hem geçmişin büyüsünü hem de çağdaş bir zarafeti bir araya getirir.

retro-fütüristik: Geçmişteki insanların geleceği nasıl hayal ettiğini yansıtan bir estetik anlayışıdır. Bu tasarım yaklaşımı, genellikle 1920’ler ile 1960’lar arasında oluşan geleceğe dair öngörüleri içerir. Özellikle bilimkurgu eserlerinde sıklıkla kullanılan retro-fütüristik tasarım, nostalji ile geleceğin teknolojik hayallerini harmanlar.

Bioshock tasarım konusunda mükemmel bir yapım.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3409671861
[h3] Skill Sistemi ve Geliştirmeler(Plasmidler ve Genetik Modifikasyonlar): [/h3]
Oyunu eğlenceli kılan kısımlardan birisi de karakterimizi genetik olarak modifiye edebilmemiz. Bu modifiyelere plasmid diyoruz. Savaştığımız makinelere ve yaratıklara şok dalgaları gönderebiliyor, onları dondurabiliyor veya arı sürüsü salabiliyoruz. Tabii ki bunlarla kısıtlı kalmıyoruz telepati gücümüzü kullanarak yaratıkların üstüne bir şeyler fırlatarak da hasar verebiliyoruz. Farklı mekanikler farklı oyun tarzları demektir. 

Ek olarak kullandığımız silahları geliştirebiliyoruz ve farklı özellikler ekleyebiliyoruz. Örneğin ben kullandığım İngiliz anahtarına buz yeteneği takmıştım bu sayede vurduğum düşmanlar donuyordu ve öldürmesi daha kolay oluyordu. Kullandığımız ateşli silahlar içinse farklı geliştirmeler var. Silahlardan bahsetmişken de oyunun oynanış süresine göre çeşitlilik yeterli.

[h3] Kontroller ve Mekanikler: [/h3]
Kontroller ve mekanikler genel olarak akıcı. Ben genel olarak çoğu yere koşmaktan çok zıplayarak gittim. Zıplayınca hızım eksilmediği için ve bazı oyunlardan bu oynanışa alışkın olduğumdan böyle oynamak daha eğlenceli geldi. Bir nevi bunny gibi bakabilirsiniz ama o kadar hızlı ve akıcı değil. Mekanik dediğimiz konuya da aslında skill kısmında baya bir değindim. Seçtiğimiz yetenekler ve silahlar ile oynayış tarzımızı şekillendirebiliyoruz. Hatırladığım kadarıyla yeteneklerin arasında daha zor fark edilme gibi şeyler vardı ama sessiz ilerlemek pek bana göre değil. Seven varsa oynarken o yetenekleri seçebilir.

[h3] Düşman Çeşitliliği: [/h3]
Oyunda splicer dediğimiz bir tür var. Bu türün kendi içerisinde farklı güçlerde ve çeşitlerde varyantları var. Bu varyantları kısaca anlatmak gerekirse;
[list]
    [*]Thuggish Splicer: Yakın dövüş silahları ile saldırıyorlar ve hızlılar. Tek saldırmak yerine genellikle 2-3 kişi yani grup halinde saldırıyorlar. Bazı yeteneklerimize bağışıklıkları var ama o kadar zorlayıcı değiller.

    [*]Leadhead Splicer: Ateşli silahlar ile saldırıyorlar bu yüzden de genellikle bizimle mesafelerini koruyorlar. Sağlıkları ise Thuggish türünden biraz daha fazla.

    [*]Spider Splicer: İsminden de anlaşıldığı gibi örümcek gibi takılıyorlar. Oyunun karanlık bir atmosferi olduğu için genellikle karanlıklarda tavanlardan ya da duvarlardan üstümüze atlıyorlar. Yakından savaşabildikleri gibi biraz mesafe ile kanca da fırlatabiliyor. Biraz sinir bozucu bir tür.

    [*]Houdini Splicer: Bu eşekler örümceklerden daha fazla sinir bozuyor. Yaklaştığınızda ya da hasar verdiğinizde ışınlanıp yer değiştirip saldırmaya devam ediyorlar. Işınlanmalarını duman bulutu ile az çok anlayabiliyoruz ama yine de bazen sinir bozabiliyor. Bu arada bu türleri öldürmek genel olarak zor değil, toplu olarak saldırdıklarında bazen sinir bozucu oluyorlar.

    [*]Nitro Splicer: Ve son olarak bizlere el bombası ya da yanıcı bomba atan varyant. Telekinesis gücümüzle bombalarını geri onlara fırlatınca pek bir esprileri kalmıyor.
[/list]

Splicer'ların davranışları, ses ve görüntü tasarımları başarılı. Bazen kendi aralarında laf atışmasına girmeleri de hoş olmuş.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3409674869
[h3] Hikâyenin Derinliği: [/h3]
Uzaktan bakıldığında FPS oyunu gibi gözükse de, aslında çok daha derin bir yapıya sahip. Andrew Ryan'ın idealleri ve Fontaine'in manipülatif planları, oyunda insan doğasını ve etik seçimlerini sorgulatıyor. Hikayenin sunduğu ahlaki ikilemler, Little Sister'lar üzerinde daha da belirgin. Kurtaracak mısınız yoksa hasat mı ediceksiniz ? :)

Hikayeyi derinleştiren diğer bir unsur, çevresel anlatım. Genel olarak linear bir yapıya sahip olsa da bölümlerde ek kısımlar var. Yani birazcık keşfedilecek yerler eklemişler. Bazen geçmişten gördüğümüz halüsinasyonlar olsun, etrafta gördüğümüz ve bulduğumuz eski yaşantılar olsun bir zamanlar mutlu ve güzel bir yaşamın olduğunu gösteriyor. Bizlere o eski ihtişamı güzel bir şekilde gösteriyor. Rapture'un nasıl çöktüğünü gözlerimiz önüne sunuyor.

 [b] Kısaca Bioshock kesinlikle oynanması gerekilen oyunlardan birisi. Etkileyici grafikleri, tasarımları, hikayesi ve oynanışı ile kesinlikle bir şans vermeniz lazım. [/b]

[h1] Puanım 94/100 [/h1] | A classic shooter with RPG elements that still maintains its old shine! Glad to be replaying the remastered version and interacting with the dark, challenging world of Rapture once more. 

If you're new to the series--welcome, and enjoy the rich plot, twists, turns, and grey characters of the world. This is the first game in a trilogy that helped define a gaming as a superb vehicle for telling stories. No PvP, no multiplayer, no online connectivity... Just you, in a fallen, art-deco Atlantis. So, would you kindly consider picking up this game and unveiling the tale? Checking all the corners of every level for loot, Easter eggs, and lore? If you enjoy gritty, story-driven games... Step right up. One could say this trilogy is a circus of value. | Love the game, hate the glitches in this remastered version. The crashing is frustrating and frequent.
I made it close to the end of the game and the game crashed which caused my save to be deleted.
I lost hours of my life, and I'm not likely not going to try again. | FULL of bugs. Lots of hassle. Lower quality than the original. Terrible remaster. 0/10 | There's always a man，
There's always a city，
There's always a lighthouse。
玩原子之心时总能看到生化奇兵的影子，同样是乌托邦、武器大师、技能书、小动画。但生化奇兵在技能方面更有建树，玩家可以随时切换自己喜欢的能力，让战斗多样化。剧情是本作一大亮点，游戏通过碎片化叙事讲述了一个充满转、讽刺与黑暗的故事——极乐城的陨落。此外，收集要素也为剧情提供了不少补充和支撑。唯一的不足可能就是重置版把原版的bug也“重置”了。"
76561198032898393,409720,BioShock™ 2 Remastered,0.0,"Action, RPG",0,"[h1] Devam oyunu dediğin böyle olur [/h1]

Serinin ilk oyununu bitirdikten sonra devamında nasıl bir bağlantı var diye merak ediyordum. Bu oyunda tekrardan Rapture'ın derinliklerine yolculuk yapıyoruz. Yani aslında yolculuk yapmıyoruz rapture'ın içerisinde başlıyoruz. İlk oyunu bıraktığımız yerden devam ediyoruz dersek yanlış olmaz. Görsel ve teknik güncellemeler, iyileştirmeler sayesinde hikayeyi daha güzel ve detaylı tanıyoruz. Hikayenin daha fazla derinliklerine iniyoruz.

[h3] Hikaye ve Arka Plan:[/h3]
İlk oyunda, Jack olarak Rapture'ın korkunç sırlarını ortaya çıkarırken Andrew ve Fontaine gibi güçlü karakterleri ortadan kaldırmıştık. Bioshock 2'de ise bu yaşanan olayların üzerinden yaklaşık 8 yıl geçmiş bulunmakta. Hangi yıllarda oynadığımızı oyunların başlarında gösteriyordu dikkat edenler bunu fark etmiştir. Şaşırdığım ve aşırı mutlu eden şey ise bu oyunda bir '' Big Daddy '' olan Deltayı kontrol ediyoruz. Yani ana karakterimiz Big Daddy olan Delta. İkinci oyunun hikayesi birinci oyuna göre daha kişisel bir hikaye. Çünkü asıl amacımız Little Sister olan Eleanor'u korumak ve kurtarmak.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3410322464
Hikaye, Sophia Lamb adında bir antagonist ile şekilleniyor. Benim gözümde kendisi yine kendini bilmez ilk oyunun boss'larına benziyor. Kendi hedefi için gerekirse Rapture'u yok edebilecek birisinden bahsediyoruz. Böyle diyince aklıma Griffith'i getirdi :d. Lamb, Ryan'ın bireycilik odaklı felsefesinin tam zıttı bir anlayışı savunuyor. Topluluk odaklı bir ideolojiyi benimsiyor. Ama bunu yaparken dediğim gibi her zaman kendi önceliğini düşünüyor. Topluluk ideolojisi adı altında onun için çalışanlara biz aileyiz vesaire şeklinde konuşup askerlerinin fedakarlık yapmasını istiyor. Manipüleci birisi olduğunu da unutmayalım.

[h3] Hikaye'nin Derinliği: [/h3]
Yukarıda da bahsettiğim gibi, ikinci oyunun hikayesi daha kişisel ve daha duygusal bir temele dayanıyor. Eleanor ile olan bağımız, oyun boyunca hissettiriliyor. Hem hikaye hem de oynanış açısından karakterimizi motivasyon ediyor. Tabii bazı yerler için oyuncuyu da motive ediyor. Sophia Lamb'ın ideolojisi ve eylemleri, Ryan'ın bireycilik felsefesine derin bir tezat oluşturuyor. Bence bu önemli ve hikayeye derinlik katan bir unsur.

Ve en güzel kısımlardan birisi. Oyunda verdiğimiz kararlar Eleanor'un kaderini değiştiriyor. İnsanları öldürecek miyiz yoksa affedecek miyiz ? Aynı şekilde Little Sister'ları hasat mı edicez yoksa kurtarıcaz mı. Bunların hepsi oyuncuya kalmış ve böyle şeylerin oyunu etkilediğini de unutmamak lazım. Verdiğimiz kararlar Eleanor'un etik kararlarını sorgulamasına neden oluyor. Hem kişisel hem de toplumsal temalar işlendiği için, bioshock serisinin felsefi derinliği bu oyunda da devam ediyor.

[h3] Ses Tasarımı: [/h3]
İlk oyunda olduğu gibi bu oyunda da ses tasarımı, atmosfer yaratımında yine harikalar yaratıyor. Big Daddy'nin duyulan adım sesleri, dalgaların derinden gelen yankıları, splicer'ların diyalogları, çıkarttığı sesler, ana ve yan karakterlerin tepkileri ve konuşmaları olsun tatmin ediyor. İlk oyuna kıyasla ses tasarımında daha derin bir ambiyans hissediliyor. Yani ilk oyundan 8 yıl sonra geçtiği için Rapture'ın çürüyen altyapısını daha iyi hissediyoruz. Bu konuda tabii ki su sızıntıları ve mekanik bozulmalar gibi şeyler hikayeyi destekleyen detaylardan birisi.

Ek olarak Garry Schyman'ın bestelediği müzikler yine oyunun en büyük artılarından biri.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3410403327
[h3] Grafikler: [/h3]
Remastered sürüm olduğunu unutmamak lazım. Eski oyunun grafiklerini modern standartlara yakınlaştırmayı başarabilen bir remastered. İlk oyuna kıyasla dokular ve tasarımlar daha net. Işıklandırma efektleri ve çevre tasarımları daha detaylı. Akvaryum benzeri alanlarda gezinirken suyun yarattığı parlaklıkları ve kırılmaları görmek güzel. Kısaca grafiksel geliştirmeler oyun için yeterli ve oyunun atmosferine büyük bir katkı sağlıyor.

[h3] Skill Sistemi:[/h3]
İlk oyundan Plasmid'leri hatırlıyoruz. Devam oyununda ise bu sistemin geliştirilmiş bir halini kullanıyoruz. Yeni plasmid'ler ve eski favorilerin geliştirilmiş versiyonları savaşlarda daha fazla stratejik derinlik sunuyor. Big Daddy olarak kullanabileceğimiz silahları, Plasmid'ler ile eşzamanlı kullanma imkanı oyuna farklı bir hava katıyor. Kısaca skill sistemi ve mekanikler sayesinde savaşlar hala çok zevkli.

[h3] Kontroller ve Mekanikler: [/h3]
Hazır mekanikler demişken bu konuya da değinelim. Oyunda Big Daddy olarak oynamak sadece görsel olarak bir değişiklik sunmuyor. Oynanış mekaniğini de doğrudan etkiliyor. Delta olarak daha güçlü, daha dayanıklı ve daha donanımlıyız. En basiti oyunun başından da anlayabileceğimiz gibi Big Daddy'e özel bir silah ile başlıyoruz. Daha güçlü olduğumuz için de savaşırken biraz daha cesur davranabiliyoruz. Kontroller de ilk oyundaki gibi akıcı ve günümüze optimize edilmiş.

Ek olarak oyunun sonlarına doğru Little Sister'ların dünyayı nasıl gördüğünü göstermeleri efsane olmuş. Little Sister olarak kısa bir süreliğine oynuyoruz.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3410402849
[h3] Düşman Çeşitliliği: [/h3]
Yani düşman çeşitliliği ilk oyuna benzer ama biraz daha değiştirilmiş ve geliştirilmiş versiyonları bizleri karşılıyor. Splicer'lar yine ana tehdit unsurlarından birisi. Ancak bu sefer oyunda Big Sister dediğimiz başka bir düşman türüyle de tanışıyoruz. Big Sister adından da anlaşıldığı gibi Big Daddy'nin kadın versiyonu. Ancak Big Daddy kadar ağır olmak yerine daha hızlı ve daha ölümcül bir düşman. Çok daha çevik ve daha tehlikeli. Sadece bize doğru gelirken çıkarttığı ürkütücü ses bile farklı şeyler hissettiriyor. (Bağıra bağıra geliyor)

Ek olarak oyunun ilerisinde splicer'lar daha zorlayıcı oluyor. Plazmidlerimize karşı farklı savunma yöntemleri oluyor.


Sonuç olarak Bioshock 2 Remastered, ilk oyunun bıraktığı mirası başarılı bir şekilde sürdürüyor. Hatta bazı yönleriyle seriyi daha ileriye taşıyan bir yapım olmuş. Rapture'ın hikayesine yeni katmanlar eklerken, oynanış ve atmosfer açısından da etkileyici ve unutulmaz bir deneyim sunuyor. Geliştirilmiş görseller, daha duygusal ve derin bir hikaye sayesinde mükemmel bir yapım olmuş. Tabii ki bazı şeylerin aynı olması ve aynı yerde geçmesi bazı oyuncuları sıkacaktır ama ben hikayeyi sevdiğimden ve ilgi çekici bulduğumdan öyle bir problem yaşamadım.

76561198032898393,228380,Wreckfest,117.11666666666666,"Action, Indie, Racing, Simulation, Sports",8,"Сделать гонки на выживание с бОльшим упором на реализм - на бумаге то развитие идей FlatOut, которое кажется закономерным и единственно верным при потере прав на название серии. На практике же получилось, что крен в сторону симуляторов, в которых победа зависит от навыка вождения, и поощрение столкновений, вносящих хаос в турнирную таблицу,  - это 2 противоречащих друг другу элемента как минимум при отсутствующем адекватном балансе уровня сложности. 

На среднем уровне сложности играть попросту не интересно - ИИ толком не способен составить конкуренцию. На уровне сложности «эксперт» до определённого момента можно играть в целом комфортно, за редким исключением борьба за победу идёт до пересечения финишной ленты, хотя уже тут начинает раздражать сам факт наличия столкновений как фактор неожиданности, т. к. при желании победить столкновения с другими автомобилями по возможности лучше не допускать и идти на таран стоит только в случае 100%-ной уверенности улучшения позиции в заезде. 

Этот самый «определённый момент» - начало предпоследнего чемпионата, с которого начинается совершенно адовый хардкор. Один вылет с трассы в результате столкновения с соперником - и смысла этот заезд продолжать дальше нет, т. к. отставание станет непреодолимым и боты, которые займут первые пару мест, далее до финиша с редким исключением будут ехать как по рельсам. Ни разу не столкнуться с местными ботами-камикадзе, которые сами впечатаются в ограждение на трассе и тебя за собой утянут, практически невозможно. Тут уже наличие столкновений как одна из базовых игровых механик Wreckfest начинает просто бесить. И становится понятно, насколько важным столпом геймдизайна FlatOut было нитро-ускорение, которое часто помогало в этой ситуации достаточно быстро вернуться в борьбу, и насколько критичным является его отсутствие во Wreckfest. Также отказ от этой механики привёл к существенному снижению динамики заездов.

Избавившись от ряда элементов FlatOut, от того же нитро-ускорения и безумных мини-игр вроде дартса, в которых водитель выступает в качестве дротика, Bugbear не смогла найти им адекватную замену, в результате чего от Wreckfest со временем просто устаёшь. Нет по сути ничего кроме кольцевых гонок и demolition derby. По замыслу разработчиков разбавить это уныние и однообразие должно было небольшое количество уникальных соревнований типа demolition derby на нестандартных транспортных средствах вроде комбайнов или заезда на трёхколёсной тачке против пары десятков автобусов, но играть в это часто также не особо интересно. 

А теперь к плюсам. Это автомобили. Их много, они все классные и отличаются по управлению в зависимости от типа привода и других технических характеристик. Уровень разрушения объектов на трассе ожидаемо высок. Графика соответствует современным стандартам.

Wreckfest более реалистична, чем FlatOut,  и в то же время более скучна, и конкретно на данный момент со всеми дополнениями выглядит скорее как заготовка для хорошей игры - контента достаточно, но необходима пересборка и доработка игровых механик. Надеюсь, что вторая часть получится более цельной и отполированной игрой. 

В Стиме, к сожалению, до сих пор отсутствует возможность оставить нейтральную оценку и, т. к. максимальная скидка на полное издание составляла чуть больше 60%, то отзыв будет отрицательный. Со скидкой 80% и более попробовать игру однозначно стоит.  | Fun destruction derby game with realistic physics and damage. | Boring AF.

音楽や映像はきれいだと思うよ！！ | One of the most genius games I've ever played. The creators made a perfectly functional, engaging, and beautiful game while maintaining a low technology requirement. This thing can run on my phone or tablet just as well as a high powered pc. While other companies are either trying to revive bad old game styles to pump out a dozen cheap games a month, or pushing pc limits so far that most people won't be able to fully enjoy their game until 5 years after release, these guys actually got it.  Gorgeous landscapes designs and characters, entertaining and thought provoking interactive story, and rock solid tactical combat that doesn't get bogged down in excessive complications. The game has never crashed, the game looks amazing years after release, and the creators didn't have to update the living poop out of it after release for it to be ""balanced"".  Damn good job Stoic Games. | It's really good--and not just good--it's really fun! Art, voice acting, setting, characters, story, combat, all enjoyable. Encounters, both violent and peaceful, are laced into traversing across the map in a way that's nicely reminiscent of a classic session of D&D. The choices you make throughout this journey really do matter, or at least they did a very good job of making it feel that way, which I take as a sign they knew exactly what they were doing when writing the game. I think what stands out as the best part of the whole thing, though, is the music, which constitutes one of the best game soundtracks I've ever heard.

I can't think of any negatives other than the voice acting was so good that I wish there had been more of it since most dialogue scenes are not voiced (which isn't really a problem in itself). 

This will probably scratch your ""turn-based combat"" or ""choices matter"" itch if you have, say, some post-BG3 depression. | The Banner Saga is one of my favorite games. Having played this several times throughout the years, and coming back again in 2025, it still holds up very well. I could not highly recommend this one enough.

 A well written story with established lore, and a world setting filled with relatable, enjoyable characters. Beautifully hand drawn backdrops, scenery, and character arts. This game pulls you in with its brilliant soundtrack. Ranging from quiet ambiance of blowing winds and people working around camps, drums and string melodies, and growing crescendos of brass instruments during battle. As always, the soundtrack is my favorite aspect in games. 

 Gameplay is is part Turn-Based Tactics, and narrative decision making, similar to The Oregon Trail and other titles. You will have to make tough decisions. Decisions made during what is would amount to a large scale military invasion. Consequences in which may see people and characters die, or decisions that may feel insignificant, but may play out eventually in Saga 2 or 3. 

 What I believe that makes this game so good, is that the main character, Rook, starts out as ordinary. Just a man trying to navigates his caravan and clansmen to safety. We, the players, follow along his journey (and others) knowing as little of the situation as the characters themselves, making it as much our journey as well. 

The Banner Saga is trilogy of games. If you interested in the concept, give this one a go. Again, I cannot highly recommend this enough. | The game mechanics are great. The lore of the game is cool, but the storytelling is terrible and hurt the fun aspects of the game. It's also very unclear how you're supposed to interpret certain parts of the story. There are parts where I'm following the dialogue and just don't get what's happening. I also found that the leveling up mechanic worked very poorly, because the level up resource, Renown, is the same thing you use to buy items and rations. This creates a situation where your team strength is hampered because you have to buy rations to keep the party fed and morale high. The game is also very unclear about how stats work. For example, I looked around in game but couldn't find anywhere to explain how dodge percentage is calculated. This results in having no idea how strong or weak certain items are. Very frustrating experience, wouldn't recommend anyone play this game but it has potential if they can sort out these issues."

And there's like 50 bros. 

This game is a blast to play multiplayer co-op and just see everything on screen exploding. A lot of my mileage from this game though is from playing arcade/campaign solo and tactically advancing and skirmishing my way through every level, and it's shocking how well the game works in both approaches. | 好久没玩，发现还有更新，还加上了官方中文，必须给好评 | 童年在4399上和伙伴们拥挤在一个电脑前打过这款游戏，好玩刺激是当时我们对这款游戏的评价，当然4399上只有这款游戏的很少一部分。后来很多年过去了，4399也早已下架了这款游戏，直到2024年夏天这款游戏打折的时候，我认识到原来《Broforce》就是童年那款《武装原型》，我便毫不犹豫的入手了这款游戏。进入了这款游戏，那种熟悉的感觉铺面而来，虽然童年时光早已远去，虽然电脑前的伙伴早已各奔东西，我依旧感谢这款游戏给我的童年带来欢乐和回忆，正如那句歌词所言“童年的纸飞机，现在终于飞回我手里”，童年与伙伴们的欢乐时光和美好记忆也始终会留在我心里。 | Случайно зашел на страницу данной игры недавно и вспомнил детство, как играли с другом на одной клавиатуре и это было просто неописуемо, такого экшена надо еще поискать, особенно когда проходишь с другом.

Разработчики просто молодчики! Начал свой знакомство с ней в далеком 2014, и началось это с ""The Expendabros"", всем советую пройти обе эти части, тем более первая абсолютно бесплатная, если попробуете - ничего не потеряете :)

For me, this game is on the same level with Minecraft, not perfect...but still masterpieces. | Охуенная игра. Однако есть несколько ""но"". 
Не советую играть против игроков (ОСОБЕННО ЕСЛИ ВЫ НОВИЧОК), ведь на PvP серверах обычно играют челики 10к часов. Можете конечно и против игроков гамать, но учтите что это пиздец сложно. 
Лично мне Insurgency нравится, несмотря на то что я довольно мало в нее наиграл.
Сам же я иногда играю со своим другом.

Короче, игра очень хорошая, не смотря на свою низкую популярность. Цена нормальная.

 XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a great game, definitely recommend. Shame it took so long for Steam to update the game on their end to actually -work- without the Take2 Launcher. | This game no longer starts up for me, which is the minimum requirement for recommending a game. | As others have said, the ""updating executable"" thing makes you completely unable to start the game. I've played this for 301 hours on PC alone, and yet for the last few months I can't even open the damn game. DO NOT BUY.

从一开始的迷茫，到找到一个类地星球的兴奋，再到因为没有多少朋友陪着玩而感到孤独，直到自己的心系里莫名奇妙出现了一个陌生的玩家，虽然他只是来挖矿的，但是还是让我感到了兴奋，因为他屁股软软的！ | Having put 235 hours into this game at the time of my review, I can safely say I more than got bang for my buck. This game respects your time so much and on so many levels... 

Want to fight Sentinels? No problem. Don't have time to fight them the next day? You can disable hostile creatures in the settings. Fights become too easy? You can turn all creatures to hostile and make it so you take more damage. You can turn on item destroy on death, item drop on death (only one grave though, so if you die twice items are gone - don't fall asleep like I did!), or you can not lose anything on death at all.

I recently finished the Aquarius redux in a night - starting off, I didn't want to waste time getting supplies for life support, shield strength, etc... so I just turned them off. Oh my goodness how much more enjoyable the expedition became because I could focus on just enjoying the journey! Currently doing The Cursed expedition and left my normal settings on, and it's been a blast. 

The fact that in 200+ hours I have yet to get bored, have yet to finish the story (because you can play any way you want... You can just jump around and explore / build like I have been with zero detriment!), and still enjoy all aspects of this game. I highly recommend this if you are a casual dad trying to live his best free-time low stress gaming life, and doubly so if you have a Steam Deck - *all* of my hours have been logged on my Deck without a single issue, and the Sleep function coupled with this game is an absolute win.

Sean if you read this... Thank you for so much, I wish this won Labor of Love: you guys absolutely earned it with how far you have come from the start ❤️ | Erro. Uma palavra simples, mas carregada de significado. Errar é falhar, é desviar do esperado, é frustrar expectativas. No Man’s Sky nasceu de um erro. Um erro de comunicação, de promessas feitas com paixão, mas sem a estrutura para cumpri-las. E, naquele momento, a Hello Games poderia ter feito o que muitas empresas fazem: seguir em frente, abandonar o jogo, e trair todos aqueles que acreditaram neles. Mas eles escolheram um caminho diferente.
Eles decidiram corrigir. Decidiram evoluir. Não apenas como empresa, mas como criadores, como artistas. O que começou como um jogo incompleto, tornou-se um dos maiores exemplos de redenção na indústria. Após cada atualização, cada linha de código, cada novo conteúdo adicionado, não foi apenas um ajuste técnico, foi uma declaração. Uma demonstração de respeito por aqueles que acreditaram no sonho.
O resultado? Um legado. No Man’s Sky, um jogo que não apenas melhorou. Ele se tornou um símbolo do que é possível quando se tem paixão, comprometimento e humildade. | 我在写这些文字的时候，已经玩了这款游戏20天，基本上我每天都会花费接近6个小时在这个游戏里。
这是我第一篇游戏评测，也是我玩的第一款关于太空主题的游戏，所以我会写的很啰嗦，很个人情绪化，算是给我自己当留念的。
我从小对“宇宙”，“未来”，“不确定性”都保有着强烈的憧憬和向往，人生清单之一就是拥有一台属于自己的天文望眼镜，亲眼见见浩瀚无垠的星空。
我不是真正的天文爱好者，只是这些美好的意象，给予了作为浪漫主义的那部分灵魂燃料，让我能对生活报以更多的热爱，我无数次幻想自己能躺在宇宙飞船里，透过玻璃窗望向星空，让思想飘荡在太空。
当我第一次接触到《无人深空》这个名字的时候，是偶然在b站看见了有关的视频，大概就是展现了遇见的很恐怖的星球。那个时候我并没有去了解《无人深空》到底是什么游戏，是什么玩法，是什么受众，我纯粹就是记住了这个名字，并且在某一次收到它打折的消息买下了它，随后就是放在库里吃灰。直到2024年的寒假，我打开了它。
就像我说的，我既不是真正的天文爱好者，也不是什么资深的游戏爱好者，我对《无人深空》没有报以什么期望，但是它确实满足了我的幻想，特别是前期的时候我登陆在各个星球进行探索的时候。当我完成前置任务成功驾驶飞船驶向太空的时候，从大气层到宇宙的转变，我真的很开心，很喜欢这个过场，同时从宇宙飞往具体的行星时，看着星球慢慢变大，山川陆地变得具体的时候，我都感到难以形容的满足，原谅我的少见多怪吧，我真的为这些感到惊喜，并且享受这种感觉。
关于剧情，我不太喜欢走剧情，乱逛是我的常态，在度过了前面的资源匮乏和不知所措的阶段后，我的日常就是，起床，处理居住点的破事，派遣船只，到处找地方卖掉一背包乱七八糟的货物（那个时候还没发现货船可以放储藏箱），偷窥空间站的飞船等级，打海盗，招揽人手，做点任务，以及解救货船的时候误伤了货船被恩将仇报。
天杀的我要和你们爆了，全给你炸了。还有修理损坏的护卫舰，我在这些奇怪的地方我代入感很强，虽然看起来很繁琐，很多重复的东西，但是我觉得很充实，很开心，就像我真的是一个货船的老大，到处奔波，忙忙碌碌。
对我来说有点遗憾的可能是换货船的时候，货船里的船员也会换掉吧，我还是很想船员们也和我一起，一直呆下去，虽然他们只是功能性外加装饰品的npc，但是我希望我的飞船上都是我熟悉的面孔，好吧，我是有点幼稚，会有”跟着我带你们做大做强，创造辉煌“的奇怪心理。说到装饰性npc，我特别喜欢 “莱拉普斯”这个小护卫，真的很喜欢，很可爱，非常可爱，在做这个任务的时候，我深怕它被刀掉了，好在之后它成为了我旅途中的伙伴wwww
尽管它只是一个npc，以及我很多次打护卫的时候看走眼一直朝着它开枪（）。以及它好吵，毕竟是机械，运行的时候响动挺大的，吵闹又沉默的可爱小东西。也算是因为对它的喜爱，我脑子一抽去查了相关“阿特拉斯”的东西，非常好，直接给自己剧透完了，这对吗这？
最近在忙着在货船基地搞基建，纯装修瘾发作了，不过能让我装修的东西确实太少了，货船的可建筑空间还是很大的，沉迷捣鼓布局和设计，设计动线和区域划分，也算是圆我小时候幻想自己能躺在宇宙飞船上看宇宙的梦了，虽，然，你，的，床，不，能，躺，真，的，很，让，我，伤，心。在装修好的房间，从窗口望去，看着那些我已经探索过的，或者没探索过的，感到好奇的，已经失去兴趣的，或相似或不同的星球，我久违的，找到了属于曾经的安宁与曾经渴望的满足。
我爱遥不可及的宇宙，就如我爱着生命的诞生与泯灭，奇迹无时无刻在宇宙诞生，无时无刻在宇宙消亡，我无法去记录，去见证，去猜测。我只是宇宙中微不可见的粒子，尽管仰头，目光所及之处皆为过去，所见之物皆为历史，人类对宇宙的幻想是一首具有延迟性的情诗，尽管身躯将我们束缚在这颗孕育了这颗美丽的乐土星球，让时间作为帮凶。好在想象力永远能带领人类跨过这些枷锁，走向更远大更深邃，更瑰丽绚烂的无限可能，抵达群星之处。
所以我接下来还会跑去其他的太空游戏，我不太擅长战斗元素比较重的游戏，如果有好心人推荐的话，万分感谢您（表情包.JPG） | El juego infinito que te permite hacer casi cualquier cosa que te imagines, tiene tanto contenido que me cada día es productivo en el juego, tengo las naves que más me gustan, un carguero pirata clase S, una base en un planeta similar a Pandora de Avatar, es una joya que vale cada centavo porque encima el contenido que añaden es gratis.

If you're more into the strategic side, it's great! There's a demo you can try out.

The art is beautiful, voice acting is okay, enemy AI is good. The campaign didn't convince me personally (although it's good to start there, at least the first 1-2 planets, because I think it contained the tutorial), but free game and weekly challenges are great. Lots of replayability.

Depending on the starting company you choose, you get different perks and already unlocked buildings. You also get some tech licenses that you use for unlocking more buildings, research licenses you use for unlocking expansions of those buildings (e.g. improving production, profit, CO2 emission, ...), etc. You can also research further expansions when you ran out of licenses to unlock them right away. So every game is different, depending on what choices you make. There are different types of planets, biomes on planets, a stock market, world congress that can decide on taxes or subsidies, natural disasters (which also might get worse, depending on how you treat the planet), ... | A great game! 

It is a challenge for me as a strategy fan. Impressive that new features and DLCs are made regularly years after the release and that the indie developers take care on the active community so well. They responded quickly to my question in the Discord support channel. 
After starting the game, I was initially a little overwhelmed by the many options in the user interface, but the tutorial explains the most important things. The tech tree is very extensive and I gathered information from the Internet. The gameplay has depth and is well balanced. Art, tech, music, voice is all good. I have smooth 60 fps and did not stumbled over a bug. 

Keep up the good work! | My game crashed trying to play the first mission of the campaign | good stuff keep the updates coming | ""your timber storage is full"" ""timber in storage 0""

[quote][i]Всем привет. Автор не несет ответственности за причиненный вред своими обзорами. Любое сходство с другими обзорами случайно. Данный обзор является лишь мнением автора и вы можете всегда оставаться при своем мнении! Спасибо за понимание и приятной игры![/i][/quote]

[h1]Описание:[/h1]
[i][b]Stellaris[/b] — это смесь грандиозной 4X-стратегии, ролевой игры и интерактивного романа, где вы сами пишете историю своего народа среди звёзд. Разработчики создали  эпическое повествование о взлётах и падениях цивилизации. От первых робких шагов в космосе до управления межгалактической империей — здесь есть место всему: дипломатии, войнам, предательствам и открытиям, которые перевернут ваше представление о жанре.[/i]

[b]Основа игры: Механики, которые затягивают на сотни часов[/b]
[i][list]
[*] [b]Создание своей цивилизации:[/b] Stellaris начинается с того, что вы буквально конструируете расу из десятков параметров: этика (милитаристы, пацифисты, ксенофобы), тип общества (биологическое, роботы, псионики), черты (адаптивность, интеллект, агрессия) и даже внешность. Хотите играть за миролюбивых космических слизней, строящих галактическую федерацию? Или за машинную империю, стремящуюся ассимилировать все органические расы? Здесь возможно всё.

[*] [b]Исследование и открытия:[/b] Галактика в Stellaris генерируется случайно, и каждое новое игра — это путешествие в неизвестность. Вы будете:
- Исследовать аномалии (например, древние руины или гравитационные аномалии).
- Встречать кризисы (вторжение внегалактических захватчиков, восстание синтетиков).
- Заключать союзы или уничтожать соседей.

[*] [b]Дипломатия и войны:[/b] 
- Дипломатия: От торговых соглашений до создания федераций — здесь можно решать судьбы галактики без единого выстрела.
- Войны: Система военных целей позволяет вести не тотальные войны, а конфликты с чёткими задачами (захват системы, освобождение вассала).
- Шпионаж и провокации: Саботаж, кража технологий, поддержка повстанцев — идеально для любителей «тихих» конфликтов.

[*] [b]Экономика и управление:[/b] 
- Балансировка ресурсов (энергия, минералы, пища, потребительские товары) — основа процветания.
- Планирование заселения планет, строительство мегасооружений (кольцевые миры, сферы Дайсона) и управление населением с уникальными потребностями.
[/list][/i]

[i][b]Сильные стороны: Почему Stellaris покоряет сердца[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]Нарративная глубина:[/b] События в игре — это не просто текст, а истории с последствиями. Например, обнаружение «Храмового комплекса» может привести к пробуждению древнего бога-червя, который переформатирует вашу расу, или к гибели всего живого в секторе.

[*] [b]Реиграбельность:[/b] Благодаря случайной генерации галактики, сотням событий и возможности создавать уникальные цивилизации, каждая партия кардинально отличается от предыдущей.

[*] [b]Моддерская поддержка:[/b] Stellaris обладает одной из самых активных моддерских сообществ. Моды добавляют новые расы, сюжеты, механики и даже полностью меняют сеттинг.

[*] [b]Постоянное развитие:[/b] Paradox регулярно обновляет игру, исправляя ошибки и добавляя новые фичи. Даже спустя 7 лет после релиза Stellaris остаётся актуальной.
[/list][/i]

[h1]Плюсы:[/h1]
[i][list]
[*] [b]Беспрецедентная свобода творчества:[/b] Создавайте уникальные расы с собственной этикой, чертами и историей. Хотите играть за пацифистов-грибов или машин-уничтожителей? Всё возможно. Проработанная система происхождений (например, «Потерянная колония» или «Синтетическая эволюция») задаёт тон всей партии.

[*] [b]Нарративная глубина:[/b] Сотни случайных событий, археологических цепочек и кризисов превращают игру в космическую сагу. Истории в духе научной фантастики: от восстания ИИ до встречи с божественными червями.

[*] [b]Реиграбельность:[/b] Случайная генерация галактики, разные типы кризисов (вторжение Пожирателей, Восстание машин) и бесконечные комбинации рас обеспечивают уникальность каждой партии.

[*] [b]Дипломатия и взаимодействие:[/b] От создания федераций до подрывных операций — здесь есть инструменты для любой стратегии. Возможность играть без войн, побеждая через культурное доминирование или политические интриги.

[*] [b]Моддерская поддержка:[/b] Огромная библиотека модов: от новых рас и кораблей до полных переработок вселенной (например, «Star Trek» или «Warhammer 40K»).

[*] [b]Атмосферность:[/b] Эпичный саундтрек, стилистика кораблей и планет, голосовые оповещения — всё это погружает в атмосферу живой галактики.

[*] [b]Постоянное развитие:[/b] Paradox регулярно обновляет игру, добавляя новые механики и исправляя ошибки.

[*] [b]Достижения:[/b] Присутствие получения различных достижений, что добавляет элемент соревновательности и мотивации с другими игроками которые смогли получить сложные достижения с особыми условиями.

[*] [b]Коллекционные предметы:[/b] Присутствуют обои, смайлики, карточки из которых можно скрафтить значки
[/list][/i]

[h1]Минусы:[/h1]
[i][list]
[*] [b]Высокий порог вхождения:[/b] Десятки ресурсов, технологий и механик могут перегрузить новичков. Обучение в игре поверхностное.

[*] [b]Проблемы с оптимизацией:[/b] На поздних стадиях игра начинает лагать, особенно в больших галактиках. Мультиплеер часто страдает от десинхронизации.

[*] [b]Дисбаланс механик:[/b] Некоторые стратегии (например, спам роботами или «танкирование» инфляции) остаются неоправданно сильными. ИИ часто действует нелогично: мирные империи внезапно объявляют войны, а ксенофобы предлагают союзы.

[*] [b]Повторяемость:[/b] После 100+ часов цепочки событий и диалоги начинают повторяться. Кризисы следуют одним и тем же сценариям.

[*] [b]Зависимость от DLC:[/b] Без дополнений (например, Utopia или Apocalypse) игра ощущается неполной. Многие «крутые» фичи (кольцевые миры, титаны) locked за платными DLC.

[*] [b]Ограниченная роль личности:[/b] Лидеры и фракции слабо влияют на игру. Их смерть или смена редко меняют курс империи.
[/list][/i]

[h1]Заключение:[/h1]
[i]Stellaris — это не просто игра. Это симулятор бесконечности, где каждая звезда может стать домом для новой цивилизации, а каждый чёрный ящик — хранить секреты, способные изменить галактику. Да, здесь есть проблемы с балансом и оптимизацией, но когда ваш флот из тысяч кораблей вступает в бой с внегалактическими захватчиками под эпичную музыку, вы понимаете: это не просто код и спрайты. Это — настоящее космическое приключение.[/i]

Всем добра, удачи и приятной игры! ^_^[/i] | Essentially a spreadsheet simulator in which you're just trying to make sure that you have the biggest or best numbers around. If you're meticulous and enjoy micromanaging, this is a great game to play. The mods for this game are also amazing! I highly recommend checking out the steam workshop for this game if you ever feel like vanilla starts to get kinda stale. And while this is my most played game, I DO NOT RECOMMEND GETTING THIS GAME FULL PRICE. Frequently this game goes on sale for like 75% and the base game alone is not worth the price tag especially as a lot of features that most Stellaris players like messing with are behind DLCs so unless there's some part of the game that you're desperate to play with I'd get the base game and any interesting DLC while they're on sale. | 肥肠好的游戏，使我的巨像旋转，之前玩的盗版，现在终于史低补票（仅本体）了，但P社的DLC是真贵，只能用学习版，等有钱了慢慢补票吧。 | So this is exactly the type of multiple month game time negative review that gets screen shot and memed on social media, but I'm sad to say I mean it in the most literal sense.  I have enjoyed much of my play time with Stellaris, but I emphatically don't recommend anyone purchase this game in it's current, maximum DLC form.
When this game launched, it was a refreshingly basic 4X. Most of the changes made in the early years all the way to the Nemesis expansion added meaningfully to the gameplay without making it overwhelming and complicated for new players.  Unfortunately recent patches and expansions have unfortunately been hats on hats, mostly adding complexity without adding fun.  I have enjoyed the ride for the most part, but like most Paradox games the continual addition of DLC eventually replaces the game you loved with something you barely recognize while draining your wallet."

[h3]Резюме:[/h3]
The Council — это детективный квест от Big Bad Wolf, разделённый на эпизоды. Во многом он похож на интерактивные сериалы.

Затянутость игры в середине очень утомляет и даже было желание дропнуть, но сюжет меня очень затянул, и мне было интересно узнать, чем закончится. 

Первый эпизод производит вау-эффект (он очень кинематографичен), но к середине игра затягивается. Концовка показалась скомканной. 

Если вы любите интерактивные детективы или сильные атмосферные истории, то The Council стоит внимания. Несмотря на свои недочёты, это очень уникальный проект. | An imaginative tale of two British super spies infiltrating a mysterious secret society controlling the world.

 | Pretty game first and foremost, Excellent art and music.

Combat is interesting in theory with the player being able to enter a paused plan mode. In this mode you plan you attacks in actions while the enemies are paused after which you must wait for a cooldown to act again. This is supported by the function system letting you customize your abilities by combining them.
This boils down to pausing using a debuff followed by as many attacks that you can cram in that hit as many enemies as possible. The enemies are nothing more than hp sacks because of this. During the cooldown there is no gameplay, you run because they turn off most abilities during recharge. 
Function ability customization is similarily half baked You got your debuff, crash, and follow it up with an ability that does damage and likely chains. Boring Boring Boring.

Opis mechanik gry jest już przestarzały(wyjaśnienie na końcu);

Dobry przykład jak ze świetnej gry zrobić totalnego gniota bez balansu nastawionego na grind i mikrotranzakcje wymuszające kupno premium by mieć jakąkolwiek szansę normalnego rozwoju konta. Gra kilka lat temu była świetna, przyjemny rozwój robotów, przyjemne walki, gra była nastawiona na umiejętności budowy robotów, co było bardzo ważną umiejętnością, a walka polegała na starannym niszczeniu najsłabszych punktów przeciwnika. Było trochę problemów z balansem, ale twórcy kompletnie nie potrafili ich naprawić mimo tego, że gracze pisali wielokrotnie co trzeba zmienić.

Twórcy wszystkie problemy zaczęli ""rozwiązywać"" od najgorszej strony, tworząc przy okazji nowe problemy. Z czasem gra straciła jakikolwiek sens posiadania umiejętności budowy, ponieważ teraz często liczy się kto pierwszy zaatakuje, a nie skill. Tutaj już nawet nie trzeba budować, twórcy dali możliwość kupowania robotów innych graczy, przez co nie ma sensu się starać, lepiej kupić potężnego bota aktualnej mety, po co budować, skoro wszystko i tak będzie gorsze? Tu też przychodzi drugi problem, balans. Zawsze był z tym problem, lecz kiedyś nie aż tak duży. Jak zwykle twórcy nie potrafią rozwiązywać problemów, przez to w grze jest pewna tzw. ""meta"", czyli najskuteczniejsze boty w grze. Przez idotyczne decyzje twórców ta liczba w tej chwili wynosi bodajże 3(tak, 3 typy robotów są skutecznie na wyższym poziomie umiejętności, reszta to strata nerwów i przegrywanie). Mobilność bota jest wszystkim ponieważ nawet najtwardsze boty topnieją w chwilę, więc nie ma sensu budować niczego innego. Chcesz pobawić się tworząc ładnie wyglądającego bota? Zapomnij, chyba, że nie masz nic przeciwko przegrywaniu 3/4 gier. Twórcy nie potrafią rozwiązać jakichkolwiek problemów z balansem. Do tego doszedł system skrzynek, który polega po prostu na tym, że gigantycznie zmniejszył średnią zdobywaną kasę za bitwę oraz zachęca do kupowania premium w postaci ""patrz, super rzadki item, kup premium to go dostaniesz!"". Bitwa za bitwą a zbudować to, co przedtem mogliśmy po ~30 bitwach teraz musimy zagrać ich ~200. Chyba, że ma się farta i się wydropi legendarny przedmiot. Ewentualnie gra pokaże go w slocie premium i będzie chciała zachęcić do jego kupna. Recykling bezużytecznych itemów na kasę w grze daje idiotycznie małe wartosci, prawie nic, gracze domagali się podniesienia wartości recyklingu, po wielu miesiącach, twórcy w końcu zrobili to, ale tylko, kiedy ma się premium(!), powodując, że teraz premium nie tylko dwukrotnie zwiększa ilośc itemów ze skrzynek, to teraz trzykrotnie zwiększa wartość recyklingu każdego itema. p2w tego nie można do końca nazwać, ale definitywnie jest to PayWall. Aktualne premium powoduje, że otrzymamy tyle, ile przed updatem zanim zmniejszyli nagrody za bitwy. Grając za darmo otrzymujemy 6x mniej. Powodzenia zbudować bota z ulubionym wyposażeniem. Gra bez premium to katorga, W dodatku gra jest wieczną alfą, co służy tylko temu, by twórcy mogli sobie dowoli zmieniać so chcą, np. jeszcze bardziej zwiększając rolę mikropłatności w grze. W rzeczywistości gra jest w gorszym stanie niż 2,5 lat temu. Kilka miesięcy temu było baardzo źle i weterani uciekali od tego szajsu. Teraz jest jeszcze gorzej.

Podsumowując: Stuprocentowy negatyw.

@edit 24.05.2019 r.
Sporo się zmieniło, nie ma już lootboxów, powrócili (nieudolnie) do tierów oraz drzewka technologii. Gra jest nadal masakryczna. Fizyka skopana, najlepsze roboty to pojedyncza broń T5 na lekkim i szybkim(najlepiej latającym) bocie. ""Connecting To Server"" wszędzie, a w dodatku by zniwelować ubytek graczy nie można już wybrać trybu gry z rotacją co godzinę. Tak. Ta sama mapa, ten sam tryb, te same ustawienia PRZEZ GODZINĘ. Dodali ulepszanie broni(by zadawały jeszcze więcej DMG!), więc TTK jeszcze bardziej zmniejszyli(za czasów Overclockingu ludzie nienawidzili buffowania DMG, widać twórcy nic się nie nauczyli). Robopassy dające jakieś kiepskie kosmetyczne przedmioty by trochę kasy wyciągnąć z umierającej gry.
Od Grudnia 2018 r. stracili połowę istniejących graczy. Jak to zrobili? Pośrednio twórcy w końcu zobaczyli, że Robocraft z początków był lepszy, więc próbują wprowadzać rzeczy i mechanikę, która była w tamtym czasie. Problem jest taki, że po pierwsze robią to nieumiejętnie, po drugie, że nadal próbują swoje ""nowości"". Na końcu otrzymujemy dziadostwo, w które nie da się grać. W tą grę gra mniej ludzi niż w Spore. I pomyśleć, że Robocraft ze swoją unikalną receptą na grę posiadał ponad 7 tysięcy aktywnych graczy.

Jakiś czas temu wyszli z Early Access, a przynajmniej zrobili to teoretycznie, bo gra nadal się zmieniała drastycznie. W sumie gra jest w gorszym stanie niż w czasie wczesnego EA.

@Edit, 14.07.2019.
No i stało się. Robocraft upadł. Freejam zwalnia ludzi bo mają mało kasy, przyznali się, że Robocraft po opłaceniu serwerów wychodzi na minus. Wszystkie zasoby idą na RobocraftX(tworzenie gry od początku). Będą utrzymywać serwery tak długo jak to będzie możliwe i naprawiać większe bugi. Kilka lat ludzie pisali co jest źle z grą, mówili jakie błędy popełniają twórcy, wszystko dostali na tacy, twórcy mieli to gdzieś i dalej rozwalali grę po swoją tajemniczą ""wizję"", która się zmieniała co update dalej rozwalając grę dziwnymi rozwiązaniami, o które nikt nie prosił. To się nie mogło inaczej skończyć Radzę nie wydawać nawet grosza na tą grę, bo pieniądze mogą przepaść. | Encontre este juego hace unos años atras. Encontre un potencial exito indie multiplayer, como por ejemplo lo que hoydia es Rocket League.
Me enamore de sus mecanicas, y del desarrollo que Freejam de entregaba a su juego, sin duda yo me alegre bastante cuando Robocraft gano el Indie del Año por parte de IndieDB.

Era esos dias en donde era una Arena 10vs10, donde llegar a Tier 10 te hacia en uno de los mejores del juego. En donde tenias que ser consistente para ir desbloqueando todas las mejoras del arbol de tecnologias. En donde la sinergia del jugador y su maquina, y lo mas importante y lo que actualmente se perdio: completo trabajo en equipo. Y quien llevaba a nivel 100 era considerado un Dios.

Donde la habilidad era para saber construir el mejor vehiculo, en todos los ambitos posibles. En donde se copiaban diseños pero aun asi quedaban con un toque personal.

Esos dias. Antes de las torres. Antes de los Megabots. Antes de los medicos.
Cuando solo habian 3 clases. Y aun asi digo que la inclusion de los medicos dio un giro muy positivo al juego.

Donde TODOS. Iban en una fila por una de las 2 lineas principales del mapa. Y en donde se producia un 50/50 en donde podia quedar la absoluta mie*da en una batalla de 10vs10 frente a frente. Y en donde el equipo contrario llegaria a su base y el equipo de dividia para ir a defender la base.

Updates pasaban y no habia tanto cambio. Incluso la inclusion de las torres era una idea fantastica, y todo el mundo en los foros dio su apoyo. Pero simplemente y en mera opinion mia, no fue ejecutada de manera efectiva, o sonaba mejor en papel. Aun asi el juego era bastante bueno en esos momentos y todavia se apreciaba ese espiritu competitivo. Lo que realmente afecto al juego fue el sistema de respawn. Antes la gente hacia cosas imposibles para sobrevivir. O intentar capturar la base enemiga. Con el respawn vi morir frente a mi todo eso.

Hasta que 2 mecanicas nuevas mataron mi idea original del juego.
Las cajas y el nuevo sistema de ""dinero"".

Incluso yo estaba a favor de perder dinero por reparar el vehiculo cada vez que perdias. Y ahora hasta puedes comprar vehiculos prefabricados.
Seguramente si el juego hubiera ido por buen camino, ahora mismo estaría jugando competitivamente en un clan.

Pero lamentablemente soñar no cuesta nada. Intentar arreglar la dignidad de este juego, mucho.

EDIT:

Me han llegado comentarios que estoy tirando mie*da al juego solamente porque soy (""fui"") ""manco"". Los estoy borrando porque la verdad no demuestran nada objetivo.

This was one of my favorite games back in 2014. It had everything you could ask for: balancing, a good community, active and attentive devs, weapons that complemented each other, fun gameplay, good progression, lack of ""pay2win"" and so forth. Needless to say, it was awesome.

Then the January 2015 update was released.

The January 2015 update added a new gamemode where you destroy towers, levelled up, and respawn if destroyed. Initially, me and the rest of the community thought ""Cool."" and waited to see what else was in store. Little did I know that the downfall of Robocraft had begun.

(Order not completely accurate)

""Megabots"" (gigantic robots basically) were removed as soon as the update came out, if not before.

Crates were introduced (partially replacing the robits system), level based CPU limits eliminated, and the tech tree removed, eliminating progression, reducing creativity, and generally made the game much worse. Despite the huge outcry and the veterans and other players who started to leave the game, the devs simply ignored the community and moved on.

Helicopter blades were added, enabling people to make flying fortresses (maybe literrally). Personally I don't think much of this.

Then weapons, most notably an anti-air cannon and a minigun, were added, making weapons unbalanced and the game more frustrating to play. As a pilot in Robocraft (a more ""traditional"" one who used plasma bombers), this particulary saddened and angered me.

A robot shop was added, further reducing creativity.

An intro was added into the game, giving the game a more ""cheezy"" feel and making it seem as if the developers were copying other games. By this point, I personally felt that the developers were catering more toward children (12 year olds) and no longer valued older players and veterans.

All this time, veterans and other older players were leaving the game as it became increasingly apparent that the developers were not listening to the community. 

A new chat system was added, featuring a clan system that the community had been asking for for a long time. This was not nearly enough however, as the other changes above (as well as others) and the careless developers made the game unenjoyable for me (and potentially other older players, although I can not speak for them on this matter).

I finally left Robocraft for good in mid 2015 (shortly after the new chat system was introduced) after a brief stint operating a hovercraft with SMGs.

In it's current state, Robocraft is unbalanced and unenjoyable. The developers are careless and possibly largely inactive (aside from bugfixes and tweaks). Gameplay is frustrating, gamemodes horrible. 

As another reviewer (spynathan) has said: ""From Robocraft to Robocrap.""

If, somehow, all (and I mean all) changes to the game were reverted back to sometime before the January 2015 update, say, November 2014, me and other members of the community (read their reviews to see what they have to say) who have left Robocraft may very well return.

Until then, goodbye Robocraft. | 看我的游戏时间就知道了。这确实是一个好游戏，我还买了永久会员，但他现在确实让我失望了。我也是从T级时代走过来的人，RC的变化我也历历在目。不过现在，FJ的小霸王服务器，将游戏改的一塌糊涂，各种毒瘤载具对新手的压制，虽然出了简体中文，玩家也更多了，但为什么RC的评价在从好评如潮下滑到褒贬不一呢？我们应该思考，FJ更应该思考。"
76561198032898393,302590,Of Guards And Thieves,4.316666666666666,"Action, Casual, Free To Play, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, Racing, Strategy, Early Access",0,"Of Guards and Thieves is a competitive multiplayer stealth game, and you don't really see a lot of those around. Plenty of cooperative stealth but rarely does a game put you against other players. In fact, the best comparison is the “Spies vs Mercs” mode on Splinter Cell: Blacklist. Basically, if you liked that mode but found it to be too severe on the Call of Duty spectrum of gaming, then I have news for you!

OGAT is the same idea but in a more indie/flash game type style. Makes sense, as many people who play it through Kongregate and aren’t even aware it’s on Steam.

The core mechanics are simple; The Guards tend to be better equipped with more health and assault weapons. The thieves have crossbows and silenced weapons, less health, but one major advantage; Night vision. They must navigate all the maps and turn off the lights while they steal a specific item that only they know about. The guards can find and patrol the multiple items but are not aware of which one it is, giving the less-equipped thieves a tactical advantage. Distraction is a major gameplay element here.

There are also other modes to mix this up, including a Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Bomb Defusal, and more.

If I had to find a criticism, well... There’s two. They both overlap slightly.

The first is that the playerbase is incredibly small, usually peaking at 200 people and going down to 40-60 in off hours. While this is a fine core for the main game mode, I have found it very difficult to explore other game modes such as CTF, or that extra large map where you explore and loot (and what ever happened to Slender?!) I pretty much see 0/10 on all servers unless it’s private or just on a different gametype.

Due to the small base of players, there’s no matchmaking and games don’t always autoshuffle so sometimes it can feel like a team is outclassing another. If it does shuffle, there may be a couple of particularly experienced players crushing everyone who just downloaded and are giving it a try. I'm not the worst player but I have on a few occasions found myself in an endless loop of failure because one enemy was just crushing it. I have some friends who can barely play it for more than twenty minutes at a time and it’s a shame.

The flip side of this; There's no equipment or pay2win system here. If you play enough you can eventually learn the maps, figure out decent hiding patterns, and perform better yourself. 
(Protip: Guards can turn off their flashlights and hide in bushes themselves, which is hard to see even with night vision). That kind of thing.

Regardless, It’s a great, small game with a fair amount of replayability. The matches are quick and bite-sized, and you can usually get several games in just twenty minutes or so. | This Game is awesome it have so many different gamemodes (Guards and Thieves,Team Death Match,Zombie Rush,Faceless(Slenderman),Insta Gib,Soccer,VIP,CTF,...), i love the design and the originall Game idea in the gamemode ""Guard and Thieves"" where the Guards defend some objects and the thieves try to steal one of them. But in the moment you feel that this game is in Early Access because you can't change Weapons so you have to play with the basic Equipment which the class offers. But i am looking forward that the developer add more Items and the New Singleplayer mode.

BUY IT!!
THE COMMUNITY MUST GROW!! | Если кто-то еще не знает об этой игре, то это что-то типо контер-страйка; только вид сверху и геймплей делает упор больше на тактику.

Классический режим с воровством ценностей здесь немного напоминает ""закладку бомбы"". Есть ряд точек на карте которые можно своровать. Истинную цель (она всегда одна) видят только воры. Важно взять хабар и успеть донести до зоны эвакуации. Если охрана поймет какие у воров намерения, то игра за красных считай слита. Менты постоянно начнут дежурить возле этого сокровища. Поэтому важно отвлекать врагов воровством других ценностей, чтобы они не понимали, что хотят украсть соперники.

Здесь вообще много интересных режимов игры. Есть прямо свистнутые у контер-страйк, типа, Защити Випа, или TDM. 
А есть и уникальные вроде ""Зомби"" (школьники его ооочень любят).

Есть классы. В основном различаются быстрый-хилый, толстый-медленный. Хотя, в наличии доктор (медсестра.. вроде). 
Покупать оружие вот нельзя, довольствуйтесь тем, что дается с персонажем. 
Но главное отличие между командами, это то, что воры обладают ночным зрением, а охрана вынуждена использовать фонарик. Также воры могут ползать в воздушных люках, или пролазить в некоторых местах (окна например). Ментам так делать видимо честь мундира не позволяет.

Воры априори слабее. Хуже вооружены, здоровья меньше. Но зато их союзник - тьма. Два вора в глухом лесу шутя вырежут всю команду соперника. Банально потому что они вас видят, а вы их нет. Стрелять в центр светлого круга от фонарика одно удовольствие. Лампочки в зданиях можно и нужно гасить\зажигать в зависимости от того за какую команду играем. 

Вроде по основным аспектам - все. Там на самом деле гораздо больше всякого интересного, и благо есть возможность ознакомиться с игрой не покупая ее - советую так и сделать.
Есть редактор карт, но пока нельзя поделиться своими творениями. Обещают добавить. Жду... очень...
10 воплей ""читер"" из 10, если лучше играешь. | 首先你需要注意，大陆玩家玩本游戏必须翻墙，否则可能无法连接到服务器。

游戏模式基本类似于《细胞分裂》的多人游戏模式。视野、光线、走位对游戏的影响很大。除去翻墙的因素，游戏本身的质量是很不错的。 | В игре есть две команды - охранники и воры. В оригинальном режиме, задача воров - украсть какой либо объект, а у охранников - выяснить, что это за объект и защитить его. Чтобы похитить объект, воры могут лазить через разбитые окна и вентеляции, что охранники делать не могут, а также все могут прятаться в кустах.(Охранники могут это использовать, чтобы неожиданно атаковать вора. В игре очень многое зависит от света. Воры имеют прибор ночного видения, а охранники только фонарик, что делает их более слабыми в темноте и заставляет воров вырубать свет везде где могут.
О классах: 
В игре есть несколько классов и в каждой тиме они различаются. 
В обеих тимах можно пикнуть медика и лечить своих тиммейтов.
Можно пикнуть ""танка"", у охранников он имеет щит, который поглощает весь урон спереди, но отнимает возможность стрелять, а у воров он просто имеет кучу хп и автомат...
Можно пикнуть ""роумера""(roamer), у охранников он имеет высокую скорость и фаер, который СВЕЕТИТСЯ, а у воров он имеет нож, убивающий почти всех с одной тычки.
Есть ""бойцы"", у охранников он базируется на сражении на средних дистанциях и гранатах, а у воров, он сражается на дальних дистанциях, наносит достаточно высокий урон и требует обладать хорошей меткостью.
Есть классы базирующиеся на контроле, они ни чем особо не отличаются, кроме оружия(Снаряжение работает по одной схеме), могут хорошо контроллировать территорию, также охранник имеет хил-спрей.
В новом апдейте появился пиро - за охранников, который имеет высокий дпс за счёт огнемёта и тоже хорошо контроллирует территорию за счёт напалм-гранат.
""Терминатор""- юзаете дробовик в упор и добиваете с пистолета, вот и вся тактика...
Плюсы: 
+Увлекательный геймплей
+Нет читеров(Я по крайней мере не видел)
+Классов хоть и мало, но геймплей за них разительно отличается
+Много режимов для фана
+Есть редактор карт
+Можно эксперементировать с тактиками
+Можно фанится с друзьями
Минусы:
-Мало игроков
-Редко выходят апдейты
-Достаточно большой пинг на большинстве сервов(Для игроков из рашки)
Если честно, я удивлён, что у игры такой маленький онлайн.
Оценка: 8/10

There was supposed to be a patch made by former community manager IdolNinja, who sadly passed away from cancer. Despite many promises to him personally that the patch would be completed, it was never completed, Volition closed down, and now, the game is just as unstable and broken as in 2009. 

Gearbox should be ashamed for continuing to sell this, for all of the problems the ports of the later games have, they are actually playable. This game genuinely crashes so often it stretches the meaning of ""playable"", and just to make it stable, you need multiple separate fan patches.

One of which is made by IdolNinja too, from before he was even hired by Volition. The fact that they didn't even bother to integrate his bugfix mod into the game's download is an actual insult to his memory. Somehow, this version of the game manages to be a ""fuck you"" to the legacy of someone who was by all accounts a decent guy.

Do not buy this. the 360 version in Xenia is a better experience. The KBM controls in this version suck anyways, it's not exactly a downgrade to play compared to this port. And you can actually play the DLC mission packs.

Gearbox is actively pissing on the legacy of a developer who died of illness working on the final patch for this game. | Saints Row 2 is the best in the series and I find it to be a amazing game.

It's just an extremely player hostile game, the designers seemed to think ""old school"" means ""obtuse"". It's not 1984 anymore, tell me how to play your game and let me fix character mistakes.
I got to level 3, it was a dumb gauntlet of getting attacked by spiders. As an old pro at Eye of the Beholder I knew how to loop them around and slant fights in my favor - then the designers started forcing me to fight them toe-to-toe. My guys would get poisoned and I had to take a trip back to the healing crystal...repeatedly. About the 15th time I was bored and sick of the game. I also found out I had accidently borked my characters, particularly the mage. Lame.
Bummer, I really wanted to like this. Play Dungeon Master or Eye of the Beholder instead. | I was in the mood for some dungeon crawling and this delivered. something I didn't expect is how much grimrock is a real time action game. It's a lot of fun to explore, solve puzzles, and learn the ins and outs of the combat system | I first got into the first-person dungeon crawler experience when I played Stonekeep. I know others had come out before it, but this was the one that intrigued me as a kid. I probably even have the CD somewhere.

Now Legend of Grimrock was a game that piqued my interest around the time it had first come out because it reminded me of Stonekeep. When I first tried it out, I hadn't made it far - maybe two floors - before I moved on. It wasn't because of boredom or lack of interest. It was simply a case of installing something else and never getting back around to it.

Well, I am now pleased to say that is no longer the case.

As I played the game, it brought back all the fond memories of my time on Stonekeep. I did have to change some of the control schemes to mimic that game because even though I had completed it in 2023 I was still expecting certain key presses to behave the same way.

I loved the exploration within the game. At no point did it feel tedious. There were some back-and-forth moments, but never anything that felt dragged out. Most of it was because I finished exploring a section and found a clue or key to get past an area that I had not yet gotten through. So obviously, I would travel to that section to get past it. There were a couple of times when I had to go back to a floor to retrieve an item - for example, I needed three torches to solve a puzzle and unlock a door. I merely went up a floor, grabbed the first three torches from their wall sconce, and viola, I was moving ahead again.

One element that I really liked in Legend of Grimrock but was not present in Stonekeep was the use of lighting and shadows. At the start of the game, you need to carry a torch with you if you want any hope of seeing what's in front of you. Later on, you can find other light sources that end up freeing your hands for other important things. But the light also has another use - to cast shadows. At one point, I was in an area where I was facing a wall. There was an empty space behind me and on the wall, there was a torch. I happened to be reading a note that I had found - and keep in mind, note reading; inventory checking, and map reviewing do NOT pause the game - when a skeleton walked into the space behind me. How did I know? Well, the torch on the wall behind us cast his shadow on the wall in front of me. It was an absolutely brilliant touch!

A game like this also has a ton of secrets which makes exploring even more worthwhile. Now the secrets varied from easy to how in God's name was I meant to figure that out?!

One other feature that I liked, which saved me plenty of headaches, especially during the final fight, was that I could disengage from an enemy and retreat to a safe spot to heal (and save if need be). 

I will eventually get around to Legend of Grimrock 2 (which honestly, I don't know how the game has a sequel with the way things ended). Hopefully, it will be just as good, if not better, than its predecessor.

Full Post: https://www.thealphabeticalgamer.com/post/l-is-for-legend-of-grimrock | A nice, simple, throwback dungeon crawler with excellent atmosphere, decent combat, solid but occasionally unintuitive puzzles, good treasure, and fun exploration. The strongest element of the game for me are its secrets - they are hidden everywhere, often require puzzles/careful observation to obtain, and have fantastic rewards. Easily the highlight of my playthrough was obtaining the Dismantler, a secret sword which has an entire floor dedicated to it. Just note that XP is pretty limited, which means you will likely be min-maxing your combat skills on every level up. If you want a mage in your party, fire magic is noticeably stronger than the other elements (at least from my experience) to the point that it will feel like you are handicapping yourself (and your fun) by choosing another school of magic. Also make sure to hold onto every rock you come across; they are often used for the game's puzzles. | Great old school dungeon crawler mixed with real time combat."

The balancing feels somewhat off, it's very difficult on the 4th difficulty and pretty much too easy on the third, also you'll get punished and lose xp for playing on lower difficulties which makes utilizing new crew members just even more of an annoying grind. 

There are a couple of other game design choices which bothered me. You are only able to sell items in the loadout screen before a mission or when your inventory is full after a mission, whenever you are in a shop and want to buy something new but you are full you can't - you have to go back to a mission into the loadout screen, sell it there and then comeback - waiting for docking inbetween makes this even more of a pain. 

Whenever there are multiple enemies swarming you, they usually won't utilize the game mechanics of bouncing bullets against walls or rarely flank you, they will just run up to your cover, hold their barrel into it and shoot directly through it, into your face - which feels pretty lame and like not very well coded enemy behaviour. 

Whenever you get overwhelmed and fail a mission you'll lose a good chunk of your ingame curreny - so the entire process of making progress doesn't come down to how smart you play because the level design doesn't bring many opportunities to do so - it comes down how good you've grinded up your character level and gear. I don't think this is a good game design choice for a linear casual game. You'll utilize the same 3-4 squad members and you'll repeat the same gameplay loop over and over again until you've finished the game. If you can't continue you simply need to grind.  

Hats serve no purpose and are just for cosmetics. 

All in all the game feels like a rather shallow 2D X-COM and it definitely has it's flaws. I still think that it has charm and is fun for atleast a couple of hours. I'd barely recommend it whenever it's on heavy discount otherwise I wouldn't. (6/10) | [h1]Roboter im Weltall [/h1]

Nachdem ich mir den [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2396240/SteamWorld_Heist_II/]zweiten Teil[/url] bereits kostenlos dank des Kuratorenprogramms zur Gemüte führen durfte, habe ich mir mal den Vorgänger geholt. Erfahren wir einmal, ob er genau so viel Spaß macht.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
In „SteamWorld Heist“ ändert sich das 2D Buddelspiel der Vorgänger zu einem rundenbasierten Taktikableger. Wir schicken eine kleinen Trupp an Kämpfern mit verschiedenen Kämpfern in kleine Missionen und im besten Fall kommen auch genau so viele Kämpfer wieder aus der Mission raus. Jede Figur hat pro Runde zwei Aktionen zur Verfügung und verfügt einzigartige Fähigkeiten. Im ersten Teil gibt es noch kein Multi-Class Prinzip wie im [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2396240/SteamWorld_Heist_II/]zweiten Teil[/url]. Stattdessen haben die Bots zwar Klassen, entwickeln jedoch mit einem Level-Up einfach linear ihre eigenen Fähigkeiten. Dies schränkt gerade neu rekrutierte Bots erst einmal ein, aber man kann sich ja sehr frei entscheiden, welche Missionen man erledigen möchte oder auch welche Bots man immer mitleveln möchte. Persönlich mag ich es, wenn meine Leute ja ein ähnliches Level haben und relativ ausgeglichen sind.  Wir zielen übrigens selber und bekommen je nach Waffenwahl manchmal eine Hilfslinie. Das Knifflige daran? Die Leute sind etwas unruhig und viele Waffen haben keine Ziellinie, die wie beim Scharfschützen extrem hilfreich sein kann.
Kurzgesagt ist “Steamworld Heist” also ein Sidescroller [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/200510/XCOM_Enemy_Unknown/]XCOM[/url], in dem wir selber kalkulieren müssen, ob der Schuss ins Ziel geht oder nicht.  Der Aufbau der Level und die Art der Feinde werden dabei in jedem Level neu generiert. Also kann auch ein bereits erledigter Auftrag beim zweiten Mal ganz anders laufen. Das Spiel ist ohnehin darauf ausgelegt, dass man viele Level öfters spielt, da man eine gute Sternebewertung oder aber zusätzliche Beute und Erfahrung haben möchte. Trotzdem ist es mit ca. 15 Spielstunden nur halb so lang wie sein [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2396240/SteamWorld_Heist_II/]Nachfolger[/url].
Zum Spielen kann ich übrigens einen Controller empfehlen, mit dem man sich angenehm zurücklehnen kann.

Nachdem die Erde aufgrund bestimmter Ereignisse nicht mehr so ganz existiert, treiben sich die Bots auf verschiedenen „Scherben“ des Planeten herum und natürlich auch im Weltall. Piper Faraday will als Schmugglerin zwar überwiegend ihre Ruhe, allerdings bekommt sie diese Ruhe dank der Schrotter und der Marine nicht. Also beschließt die Dame auf eigene Faust mal so richtig durchzuräumen. Auf dem Weg kommen wir einer größeren Geschichte auf die Spur und unterhalten uns mit unseren rekrutierten Mitgliedern, die ihren ganz eigenen Charme mit einbringen.

Allerdings darf man hier jetzt keine große Geschichte erwarten, die voller Plottwists ist. Stattdessen haben wir unsere eher oberflächlichen Helden und bekämpfen oberflächliche Feinde. Zum Verständnis hilft es, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/571310/SteamWorld_Dig_2/]SteamWorld Dig 2[/url] gespielt zu haben. Aber notwendig ist es sicherlich nicht.

Um man die braucht…Am Interessantesten dürfte das DLC „The Outsider“ sein, in dem wir ein neues Mitglied für unsere Crew bekommen, der eine Verbindung zum Vorgänger [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/571310/SteamWorld_Dig_2/]Steamworld Dig 2[/url] mitbringt. Diese Figur hat nicht nur im Kampf interessante Fähigkeiten, sondern bringt auch ein paar neue Missionen mit.

[b]Fazit[/b]
Genau wie der [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2396240/SteamWorld_Heist_II/]zweiten Teil[/url] hat mir auch der erste Teil sehr gut gefallen. Die Spiele ähneln sich zwar, aber dennoch kann ich beide klar empfehlen. Dieses Spiel fällt hier noch etwas flacher in den Spielmechaniken wie Klassen aus. Auch haben wir noch keine Oberwelt zu bereisen. Man könnte also sagen, der erste Teil ist simpler, aber auch das ist erfrischend. Leider wird es keinen dritten Teil geben, aber ich kann die „Steamworld“-Spiele, die sehr vielfältig sind, trotzdem sehr empfehlen. 


Rundenstrategie mag ich ja sehr. Für mehr davon und noch viel mehr Reviews in anderen Bereichen schau doch mal in [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Drakeschool] meiner Steamgruppe[/url] oder der [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ger_steam] German Steam Community[/url] vorbei! | This game is a really fun turn-based tactical shooter. However, it falls apart at the higher difficulties due to the alarm mechanic which forces a slower turn based gameplay into a rush as more enemies pile in which can quickly overwhelm you. This is even worse towards the end of the game as you get enemies which can teleport and shoot on the same turn with two or three enemies spawning each turn. This game definitely rewards quicker strategy over slow turn based turtling combat like XCOM. The 100% for this is also really difficult with the whole game being required to be completed on the highest difficulty with no mission failures, all missions fully completed, and in 800 turns or less across the whole game. | Com certeza é um dos melhores jogos de estratégia por turno que já vi.

A história, apesar de simples, é boa e é uma sequência direta dos eventos de Steamworld dig 2. A trilha é opercional, mas os efeitos sonoros são muito bem feitos [se for banco sonoro to chocada]

O melhor mesmo é o fator replay + os personagens interagindo entre si. Vale o preço cheio sem dúvidas, são pelo menos 10h de gameplay. | Игра супер! Особенно когда ёбаный прицел соскочит на пару нанометров и ты получаешь пизды от своей же гранаты, а дед вибрирует на сверх высоких частотах и вместе с ним ствол (┛ಠДಠ)┛彡┻━┻. Затем оргазм от филигранного залета снаряда гранатомета и разборка целой пачки банок прошивкой. Рекомендую играть сначала на Ветеране. Инструментарий в игре не большой, но все, что имеется, полезно и приятно использовать. Глубина в механиках не очевидна, но она присутствует. 
Итог таков: играть приятно, визуал хороший, музыка супер, близких аналогов в плане геймплея не знаю. Значит опыт уникальный и к ознакомлению рекомендуется."

All over it is a very good game 9/10. | One of my absolute favourite games of all time. The story itself is nothing crazy but the gameplay is absolutely great. Plus the system they have in place for the orcs and their hierarchy is nothing short of amazing and one of the best way to service the amazing gameplay throughout the whole game. | Gerek savaşları olsun gerek komutan öldürmesi olsun hem zevkli hem de aksiyon olarak oynanması gereken bir oyun olduğunu düşünüyorum.

Sürekli komutan çıkması (bitmeden) bu çok saçma olmuş. Ancak combat kısmı, suikast teması, okçuluk teması, ara sahnelerdeki diyaloglar vs. inanılmaz bir oyun sizi büyülediğine eminim. Şunu bilmelisiniz ki bazen olur ya sürekli bunu mu yapıcaz dersiniz onu diyen bir kişiliğe sahipseniz bu oyundan biraz uzak durabilirsiniz. | To sum it up this game is Assassin's Creed mechanic + Arkham Asylum combat + LotR lore, it's pretty much enjoyable if you're a big fan of Tolkien like i did.
Story and DLC is great, but combat is mediocre since you can get stuck on random geometry and get killed much more easily (captains and warchief will overwhelm you inside the stronghold if you're alone with no branded allies).
Endgame content is time trials and isn't everyone's cup of tea. | Shadow of Mordor is an awesome way to explore Tolkien’s universe, and the Nemesis system makes it stand out from other open-world games. Watching Uruks remember past fights, gain scars, and rise through the ranks makes every encounter feel dynamic and personal. The story and environment are both stellar, capturing the dark, gritty feel of Mordor while still giving you plenty of freedom to explore. Combat is smooth and satisfying, especially once you start unlocking abilities and feel like an unstoppable force.
I originally played a ton of this on Xbox years ago and loved revisiting it on PC, I definitely recommend a controller for the best experience. The achievements were a bit of a grind, but they pushed me to try new strategies and abilities I hadn’t messed with before, which actually made the game more fun.

No game，no life.这绝非虚言。
小初时期在家传的旧电脑上，游玩一些可以带的动相当古早的一些游戏。在二十一世纪的第二个十年，在一系列堪称巅峰级别的大作接连发售时，我却似乎和我的电脑一起被困在了时代里。
妇孺皆知的红色警戒，彼时烂尾的大作命令与征服三发售时，我还在为兵临城下模组着迷；R星的侠盗猎车手V发售的五年后，我还在和汤米维塞迪，卡尔约翰逊一起在前3d世界观中遨游；当CS：GO已经成为现象级游戏，而此时CS1.6的人机还会卡在大仓的隧道里一动不动；至于2016年发行的文明VI六，飞天之梦响彻云霄时，我在北方的那座小城里，听着BabaYet的沙锤声，游玩着2007年发行的文明IV第四代（很巧也是四）以及跃跃欲试但在2016年仍带不动的2013发行的文明V第五代。如果说前款游戏是中国游戏界现象级的存在，而我在这个时代的最末期仍游玩的津津有味。对于文明系列，可以这样说，游戏甚至某种程度上改变了我的人生轨迹。如果我当时没有把心思放在自给自足得到的这些关注人文，关注历史的游戏上，而是去参透什么别的兴趣。也许有可能我就不会学文科，也不会选择现在的专业。
感谢某些无脑盗用游戏画面的游戏小作坊，把自己的游戏用其他游戏界面进行包装，搭便车宣传自己粗制滥造的游戏，但无巧不成书，也让我阴差阳错的知道了Paradox Interactive——一个曾经冷门，现在热度与日俱增甚至一度市值超过育碧的世界级游戏公司——以及属于他的作品们。很可惜和上述所有的游戏一致，我似乎也只“配”玩到极落后版本的游戏——这甚至也是一种奢求。不出意料的，当我尝试运作1.1版本的欧陆风云四时，电脑烧了。
这时是2020年初，拜疫情网课所赐，我终于有了一台自己的笔记本电脑，在通过各种渠道帮助下，从一位网友手中拿到了一份学习版的1.30版本的欧陆风云四。那个夏天，在烈日和暴雨下，以大明为开局，我的游戏生活第二春开始了。
但直到2023年高考结束后，我才在steam上买到正版的EU4，反倒是HOI4 21年就有了正版，那时候小黑盒还是卖兑换码的，现在早就没有了。
直到今天，2025年1月25日，本游戏严格的在线时长突破了一千小时，完成成就190个。这其中有太多的故事可以讲了，用法兰西拿破仑传播共和革命理念，用金雀花王朝重新统合大陆领地成立安茹帝国，从长白山脚下一隅到全中华的大清，从高加索群山中杀出的萨法维波斯，荣耀的哈布斯堡让Aeiou的格言传遍欧洲，摆脱鞑靼枷锁，“为了俄罗斯母亲”的莫斯科大公国，把握土木之变，重返中国的瓦剌，乃至重建蒙古帝国。令人感触最深的定是用拜占庭一隅小国绝境翻盘，重获新生，再造罗马，紫凤翱翔！感谢她给了我一个在现实中编织一个梦的机会，也让我在这个梦中徜徉，流连，不愿醒来也不愿离去。
游戏的意义和人生每件事的意义大抵都相类似，再你经历其中时，拼尽全力的达成那个目标，结束之后回头看，除了享受结果，更感慨唏嘘其过程，这便是寄意寒星荃不察，不负光阴不负心。
希望以后更好，直到时间和世界的尽头。

 | right now on almost 1300 hours, almost completed tutorial.
But honestly it's not an easy game.
You need to watch some videos how other people play it and decide if you want to throw thousands of hours on it. 
I think that it's the easiest grand strategy(not including Knights of Honor which is very simple in comparison) and if you want to start playing grand strategies from Paradox - probably it's you best shot.
Playable without DLCs but if you really love this game - you could either buy some of the DLCs or just buy subscription and wait for EU5 | 我非常喜欢这个游戏，目前陪伴了我好几年了，这款游戏让我影响非常深刻，而不是说这游戏有多好，但游戏确实也不错。曾经我有个女朋友，我非常爱她，她也非常爱我，直到有一天我发现了这款游戏，但游戏没有中文，让我很难过，也让我不得不去学习英文，过后我的生活就变成了上班-下班-学英语，这持续了很长一段时间，后来有一天，我女朋友说我不爱她了，她说再也感受不到火花了，后来她查了很久，以为我学英文的时候爱上了洋妞，但她后来发现是这款游戏导致的，因为我在这游戏上花了很大时间。某天她登上了我的Steam，改了账号改了邮箱，改变了一切，当我玩的时候我发现我登不上去了，她告诉了我真相，我到现在都任然记得她说的话：“我真的好爱你，但后来你因为一款游戏变成这样，为什么？难道是你感觉我不够爱你吗？为了嫁跟你我因为彩礼的事情和家人吵了一架，我向我家人发誓我再也不会回那个家。但如今来看你却这样对我。”我当时脑就好像少了根筋，和她吵了一架，就这样我们分手了，当我学会英语后，游戏我也玩腻了，我试着找回她，我用了3个月的时候，得到了一点消息，她在2017年9月20几号的时候就跳江自杀了，也就是我和她分手的半个月左右。在后来的这些年里，我玩着游戏玩着玩着就会泪流满面，7年了，我好后悔当初我的所作所为，如果当初有中文，就不会发生这种事情，因为这件事情我到现在都还没有结婚，我一直安慰自己我的妻子怀着我的孩子因为Paradox在7年前就已经死了，所以Paradox罪孽之大，这个公司杀死了一个孕妇，上帝一定会惩罚他们的 | very addicting. early game is ton of fun but frankly late game gets a little boring."

It's one of the first game's I've ever played that implement multiplayer, but doesn't make it needed to play with friends to have a conversation. This is the most friendly fan base I know and in a match you never know what you're going to be chatting about. Just a disclaimer though, this game is not for those with short attention span, because in some game modes a match can take more than half an hour, and if you're unlucky and die first, you need to watch the whole match to get the experience. Trust me you wan't the experience, because it's when you level up you unlock most of the weapons, and the level scaling is harsh, the first 70/100 levels are not so hard, but just so you level 78 needs around 900,000-1,000,000 experience, and yes this is a lot but level 100 needs over 9,000,000 experience in total, and just to put in perspective how much that is, the most I've gotten from single match that spanned for more than a hour is around 5,000, so don't expect it would be easy to get to level 100, you'll need around 1000 thousand hours, because I'm at level 78-79 and I've almost played 90 hours.

In conclusion you'll probably not finish this game that is about shooting at each other with a large array of weapons, because level 1000 which is the final level, craves that you play for hundreds of hours. But don't be scared away by this, personally I give it a 8,5/10, very good but I'm not spending these 900 hours just to get all achievements and weapons.
You should by this if you have time on your side and can play/watch matches that are over 30 minutes. And remeber to chat about something, because it's very likely that someone will reply and a start a conversation"

Nachdem kürzlich [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1522160/Disney_Epic_Mickey_Rebrushed/]das Remake zum Vorgänger[/url] veröffentlicht worden ist und sowohl der Vorgänger als auch Disney Epic Mickey 2 im Sale waren, musste ich mir dieses Spiel einfach holen.
Zuallererst sollte ich gestehen, dass ich keinerlei Nostalgie für Disney Epic Mickey 2 besitze...
Ich habe es nicht in der Kindheit gespielt und kenne lediglich den Vorgänger aus Derselbigen.
In [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/vazeyo/recommended/1522160?snr=1_5_9__402]meiner Review zum Vorgänger[/url] schrieb ich noch:

[quote=Review zu Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed]""Ursprünglich hab ich mich seelisch und moralisch darauf vorbereitet mir das Spiel für meine Switch zu holen und mit lediglich 30 fps (oder wie viel auch immer mir diese Konsole hätte geben können) zu leben. Bin aber dann doppelt froh gewesen zu sehen, dass das Spiel auf Steam erschien.""[/quote]

Tja, und genau dieses Problem hat Disney Epic Mickey 2...
Die framerate des Spiels ist auf 30 fps festgelegt. Das lässt sich auch nicht mittels der .ini-Datei innerhalb des Spiels abändern. Glaubt es mir. Ich hab es probiert.
Grund, das es nicht funktioniert, ist, dass die Animationen innerhalb des Spiels nicht so viele frames besitzen, d.h., dass wenn man das Spiel zwingen würde auf - sagen wir mal - 60 fps anzuzeigen, so würden es die Animationen nicht mitmachen und stattdessen in Zeitlupe abgespielt werden. Ja, richtig gelesen.
Durch diese technische Limitation macht Spielen hier nicht sonderlich viel Spaß und weil ich eben hierbei keinerlei Nostalgie verspüre, hab ich mir gesagt:

[b]""Ich breche das Spiel ab.""[/b]

Ich persönlich warte lieber auf eine ähnliche Bevormundung des Spiels wie es der Vorgänger erlebt hatte: eine Art Remake. Vielleicht ist ja ""Disney Epic Mickey 2: Rebrushed"" gleich um die Ecke?
Bezweifle ich zwar eher, weil der Publisher wohl nicht sonderlich zufrieden mit der Verkaufsanzahl des Remakes war, [url=https://steamdb.info/app/1522160/]wenn man sich anschaut wie häufig das bereits nach Veröffentlichung im Sale war...[/url] Ich bezweifle deshalb genauso sehr, dass es ein Remake für den Nachfolger geben wird. Ich lasse mich allerdings auch sehr gerne überraschen.
Eines jedoch hatte das Anspielen des Spiels Gutes für sich: Ich habe die HUB-Welt ""Mean Street"" mal wieder gesehen und dabei speziell die Unterschiede zum Remake. War so deshalb auch für mich minimal interessant.

[h3]Gutes & Schlechtes:[/h3]

[u][b]Pro:[/b][/u]

+ Charaktere sind nun richtig vertont und machen keine ausschließlichen [i]Sprech-Grunz-Geräusche[/i] mehr
+ Die Nutzung von Farbe & Verdünner ist bereits in meiner kurzen Spielzeit nochmal deutlich kreativer verwendet worden als im Remake des Vorgängers. Das lässt sich auch bei den Puzzles des Spiels bemerken
+ Finds witzig, dass man Oswald mit dem Pinselschwung schlagen kann

[u][b]Contra:[/b][/u]

- Es gibt keinen Lokalen Mehrspieler, den es in der Konsolenvariante gegeben haben soll
- Oswald ist als KI-Kamerad nicht gerade die hellste Birne am Kronleuchter
- Ortensias Stimme im Englischen klingt furchtbar und nervig
- 30 fps ist das Maximum. Mehr geht nicht. Ins Besondere Kämpfe sind dadurch eine ziemliche Tortur

[u][b]Prontra:[/b][/u]

+- Es gibt leider keinen Dash mehr wie im Vorgänger (Vielleicht aber schaltet man den später noch frei und ich hab den bisher nicht erhalten? Im Vorgänger hatte man den jedoch schon von Anfang an...)
+- Kostüme gibt es zwar einige Neue, aber auch alle Alten aus dem Vorgänger, was ziemlich öde ist
+- Räume zu betreten muss aufwendig vom Spieler erstmal betätigt werden, bevor sich da irgendetwas in der Richtung tut. Starker Kontrast zum Remake, wo man einfach in den Raum hineinlaufen konnte. Ob das eine Hardware-Limitierung ist, weiß ich nicht, aber nicht weniger nervig ist es schon

Es jugable pero parece una versión un poco light del original y le he agarrado un odio increíble a la IA de Oswald que lo ultimo que hace es ser útil. Las misiones no son claras en el sentido de que no es muy obvio cual es la buena y cual es la mala, la cámara no te deja plataformear a través de los a veces confusos escenarios y por ultimo aun sigo teniendo pesadillas con la skin de mago de Mickey. Por el resto esta bien; los enemigos y jefes existen, hay partes en donde el arte de Epic Mickey se ve bien darks como en el primero, la historia del doctor loco estuvo interesante si omitimos el hecho de que era obvio que era malo todo este tiempo y no habían muchos bugs, tal vez como uno o dos. Me gusto mucho los proyectores, los corredores, el doblaje y Goofy. 

Esta es mi opinión, no es universal, proba el juego si no te convencí. | perfeito

mas nao se enganem, o primeiro é superior
a versão de pc é a pior versão do jogo, roda a 30 cravado e nn tem multiplayer como na versão de consoles

mas por outro lado ele é divrtido, e... uh.. bugado?

SIM, bem bugado, eu skipei uma ÁREA INTEIRA com um double jump + attackKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
mas é um jogo maravilhoso, com grandes problemas técnicos, mas ainda sim é EXTREMAMENTE bom!

The trailer shows the PS3/Xbox 360 port which honestly back in 2007 we should have all gotten but nope we got the PS2 version ported over instead which looks horrible in comparison and it just shows utter laziness on the devs part if we did not even get a half decent looking port.

I grew up on this which is the only reason I'm giving a positive rating.

I've been seeing some people expressing that they've experienced a couple of crashes which I've also experienced, however I've only crashed about twice during my whole play-through so far I'd say? I pretty much finished the base game at around 8-9 hours and now I'm just getting extras, so the game is not too long to complete if you're looking for a shorter game to play.

76561198032898393,315440,Unknown,0.0,,0,"A great example of a movie tie-in done right. It's a bit like God of War meets Prince of Persia.

Two things if you're thinking of buying this game: Be prepared to play with settings and .ini files in order to get this game to run the way you want. Second, do NOT play the game on Hard mode to start with. Enemies will kill you in ~3 hits, they have much higher damage and health intended for a subsequent playthrough. When you first start the game you won't have any upgrades, so expect to be destroyed in Hard mode or multiplayer. It's not that the multiplayer is unbalanced or anything, it's that upgrades are shared. The single player upgrades give you more health/energy and unlock more of your disk modes. Without those, you're at a disadvantage against any human player who is further along in the game. Once you get a handle on the single player unlocks/upgrades, everyone's on the same level bar their loadout.

Bear in mind that the multiplayer is mostly dead at the time of this writing. I hosted a bot match, one player joined and completely obliterated me because he had already unlocked everything. It's definitely *worth* bringing back to life by joining a community group and organizing games, but there's no guarantee that this game will ever get popular enough to jump into an open game at any given time.

The single player is very fun, though it may not sound exciting on paper. Half the time you'll be performing simple parkour through the level, then when you arrive at the next combat arena you spend the other half of your time fighting groups of enemies. New mechanics are introduced gradually, as are new ""modes"" for your identity disk.

The controls and targeting work well; it takes a little bit of practice to get a feel for the movement animations, but once you get an idea of what you can do the game really flows between acrobatic moves and attacks. In order to regain health and energy (used to perform heavy and special attacks), you must break off from your relentless assault to parkour across special surfaces and objects. With your health or energy refilled, you can then launch yourself into the air and fling your disk at the enemies, hitting hard and bringing yourself back into the fray. The heavy emphasis on making use of the environment and objects keeps the gameplay fresh, even though the levels are all variants of ""blue city populated by orange bad guys"". Each new combat arena is set up with a new challenge and a different set of moves to regain health or energy. You'll be too busy diving in and out of combat and frantically parkouring to get your health back to notice much else.

The multiplayer is extremely cool, allowing players to do all the things they've always wanted to do in the Tron universe. Parkour and disk-based combat make the transition, challenging players to deflect, dodge and parkour around each other while disks fly in every direction. In the large maps, pressing a certain button will make your character leap into the air and generate your own light-cycle. It's possible to drive normally or make use of 90 degree turns, as you have seen in both movies. You can even throw your disk from the light-cycle to take out enemies as you drive by or to attack other light-cycles directly. There are even multiple models of light-cycle that you can choose between, each with different stats. Tanks can be brought into the battle by capturing certain points on the map, turning the multiplayer matches into beautiful spectacles where players are leaping on and off of light-cycles, flinging disks at one another. Where single player upgrades give straight stat increases, multiplayer unlocks provide a wide range of buffs usable in custom loadouts.

I'm loving this game, it was well worth the price and may find new life via multiplayer on Steam. It's worth buying for the single player and bot matches, even if the (awesome) multiplayer never really catches on. | I love this game. Claims it only has partial controller support, I've had no issues using just a controller. It has a perfect mix of Parkour/Platforming & Action/Fighting & doesn't take too long getting used to the controls. I have nearly completed it twice in 1 day mostly because I'm trying to find the collectables I missed first time round & to unlock & level up more abilities/loadouts. The controls are good & the story quite frankly is a lot more engaging than the movie companion Tron: Legacy.
I've yet to play the PC multiplayer but when i played it on PS3 it was fun I can't imagine it would be any different on PC.
I highly recommend getting this game if you either enjoy Tron or just general Cyber Sci Fi genre. | TRON: Evolution отнюдь не повторяет фильм Трон: Наследие. Наоборот, это скорее предыстория, которая заполняет разрыв между оригинальным фильмом и его продолжением. Герой первого фильма, Кевин Флинн, живет внутри созданного им компьютерного мира Grid и пытается преодолеть неприятности, которые неожиданно свалились на его голову.
В компьютерном мире появляется новая форма жизни, ISO, и многие программы с недоверием относятся к этой расе. Но это еще не главная беда. Агрессивный вирус во главе со злодеем Abraxas захватывает новый мир, превращая как программы, так и ISO, в мерзких зеленокожих существ, далеко не таких дружелюбных, как хотелось бы.
Вы играете за персонажа по имени Anon, который является системным монитором и по совместительству – аватаром Флинна в мире Grid. И, конечно же, вам нужно выполнить миссию спасения и выставить наглый вирус из вашей любимой компьютерной вселенной.
Вам предстоит пройти сквозь незамысловатое повествование, чередуя бег по стенам и прыжки через пропасти с другими акробатическими упражнениями. Что действительно приятно, так это точность движений: каждый прыжок вы ощущаете, как свой собственный. Впрочем, особенно разгуляться по миру вам не дадут, и заблудиться – тоже: весь путь отмечен яркими маркерами. И даже смерть персонажа не станет для вас большим расстройством, так как у вас на пути будет масса точек автосохранения. Приятно, с одной стороны, но это лишает игрока некоторого внутреннего напряжения и чувства «реальной» опасности.
Что в игре порадовало, так это гонки светоциклах, особенно в режиме мультиплея. Во-первых, это просто красиво (не поверю, если вы скажете, что равнодушны к этому средству передвижения). Во-вторых, никто не даст вам прокатиться, как по гладильной доске: вы будете лететь со скоростью света, преодолевая внезапные повороты и самые разнообразные препятствия. Играя с друзьями, вы получите массу эмоций.
Если абстрагироваться от прекрасного и вернуться к основной части игры… Честно говоря, хотелось бы видеть нечто большее. Игра действительно во многом перекликается с первым фильмом, а озвучка голосами любимых актеров только дополняет атмосферу, но видно, что разработчики решили «выехать» на самой концепции, не потрудившись особенно над наполнением.
Игра очень красива, но, как и многие игры, сосредоточенные на прекрасных графических эффектах, она страдает от одного серьезного недостатка — однообразия. Ваш герой Anon встречает по пути массу друзей и врагов, но при этом выглядят они чересчур похоже, одинаково прекрасные в облегающей коже, подсвеченной различными неоновыми оттенками. А тела их будто не движутся, а перетекают из одного положения в другое. Очень приятно наблюдать, как облегающие фигуры прыгают с платформы на платформу, двигаясь будто капли воды, но душа просит разнообразия.
Все локации вселенной Grid тоже выглядят удручающе однообразными, несмотря на большое количество городов и регионов. Tron-City, Arjia, колония Bastrum, и даже внутренности гигантского корабля — все это вызывает навязчивое чувство дежа вю. Единственное отличие – это цветовая гамма, которая позволяет убедиться в том, что вы таки куда-то переместились.
Справедливости ради, скажу, что от мрачной атмосферы и гонок на светоциклах удовольствие наверняка получат все, даже те, кто не числятся среди фанатов мира Tron. Но мне кажется, что до конца игры дойдут только самые терпеливые.
Так же хочится упомянуть о проблеме игры с оптимизацией. Одним словом оптимизация дно. Первая проблема была при входе в игру. Я удивился табличке с надписью ""Если не войти в игровой профиль Windows Live, то прогресс не будет сохраняться."" Как я мучился с созданием этого профиля, но в итоге пришлось создать внутри игровой. Следуйщая проблема возникла после 3 или 4 включения игры. Опять же при запуске игры у меня вроде бы всё шло нормально, но потом всё пошло на перекосяк. При входе в меню нужно нажать кнопку мыши, при нажатии кнопки сразу вылетает игра и высвечивается окно якобы игра не отвечает. При нажатии кнопки ""Искать решение в интернете"" шёл поиск, но он сразу же вылетал. Пробывал и переустановить, но всё повторялось. Если бы не эти проблемы, то я бы дал игре больше баллов, но эти проблемы всё испортили.
Итог: 6/10. | As a movie tie-in, this game is pretty good, even if it's basically a Prince of Persia clone with slightly more wonky controls. But TRON is my religion and therefore I can't say anything else about Evolution, since I bought the original version on day one and worshipped it like a holy relic.
My body needs to play this game at least once a year, and you know yours want, too. | Despite what others say about the installation of the game, it's very easy if you follow LDSO's YouTube instructions. Games for Windows Live has not been a problem for me anymore, and multiplayer works fine like it did before. I should note i'm running Windows 10 and it works perfectly. The game itself has quite some flaws such as audio inconsistency, support for up to only 1600x900, and actors not working properly (rarely), but overall it's a fun game to play through and manages to create that TRON atmosphere while playing. 

The real gem hides in the multiplayer feature of this game. There are arenas where you can have disc wars, light cycle battles, or even both at the same time against other players. There is also different gamemodes such as capture the flag, bit runner, and control points. Unfortunately, there are not many daily players for this game right now, however if you manage to get a group of friends or host an event, I can assure you it will be a very fun experience.

I would rate this game a 8/10 and recommend others to play, as well as the multiplayer as it's one of the most fun things to do in TRON: Evolution."

While the game itself is pretty neat, it's dead. There is no matchmaking (as a level 7 in bronze rank I went up against a lvl 81 in what looked like a diamond rank, the rest were levels 30's,40's,50's etc). The reason why there is no match making is because you would have to wait forever for a game.

If you are able to get past the fact its dead, and for it to take a 100 severely uneven matches before you had enough ingame currency to get a decent team then you might get something out of this. Otherwise don't waste your money like I did. This edition doesn't unlock the champions automatically, you still have to play games to slowly earn ingame currency to unlock them and you have to put up with no matchmaking of any sort. There was 20 odd people in the lobby and its a Saturday early evening (US).

I am not going to talk too much about the game itself because while it's actually a pretty cool little game and if it had the population it would be worth the $10 imo (but I like tactical strategy games a lot if you didn't it would be questionable if it was worth the $10). But when you are dealing with a game that is built on a foundation of being a PvP/Vs game (there is a practice mode against AI), without a population to support it it doesn't matter how nice the game is.

I was under the impression that the recent release of the Master edition was an indication that the game had a decent population and was going well, but instead it seems like its a last ditch effort to sqeeze whatever money could out of this game before it finally dies completely.

Save your money! | If your reading this, i want you to understand what an amazing game this is. Its one of the best strategy games i have ever played simply because its so much like chess. Each champion is a new peice i can play with, each map is a new terrain i can master. I wish this game got into the mainstream so many can witness its tactical beauty. This is one of the few games left that is still skill based. Please give it a try , dont miss out on this wonderful experience. | First off, if you're looking at this because the explore queue told you it's new on steam
It's not. I made the same mistake. I just looked at the pretty pictures and thought ""This seems neat, I'll get it""
It is however noted in the description, so that's my own fault for not reading that.
For the free game, go here. I recommend giving it a try to see if you like it, and if you do, you can always come back and get the masters edition. But I'll explain the game and review it here

http://store.steampowered.com/app/247830/?snr=1_5_9__300

Aerena is a tactical turn based combat game in which you and your opponent control 3 champions, and need to take out eachother's health, each on the other side of the arena. To do this, either damage the ship directly, or kill your opponents champions - A champion killed in whatever way damages your opponent. And there are a lot of ways to kill champions. Aside from standard attacks, champions can be pushed off the side of the field(Instant kill) or pushed onto a death or damage tile. It has a decent amount of tactics involved in it, but it feels a bit small.

Champions all have two actions per turn, which can be used to move, attack, use a special ability, or to activate one (Out of three) of your personal special abilities. Positioning and the use of these abilities is what seems to be the way to victory. Most champions appear balanced, but there do not seem to be a whole lot of them, and they don't seem to be organised in any really obvious way. One of the heroes gets stronger with more pirates on the board - But at a glance, I can't see which of them are pirates and which aren't, I'd need to delve into their descriptions for that. There do not seem to be a lot either, you'll see most of them fairly quickly.

For my own personal taste, matches appear a bit slow, though it appears to have been made with this as a goal. You get a lot of quests (One carreer quest, and three other quests, which were described as daily but they just kept coming) and tasks to complete during your matches, which give you 'shillings', the currency of the game. With these shillings you can unlock new champions, new personal abilities, and a new ship(Which gives you a different effect based on the ship)

It's a solid, though perhaps slightly underwhelming game with decent gameplay and decent progression. It's well-balanced and it's pretty good for spending a bit of time on every now and then. For 10 dollars, yeah, I suppose it's alright, though I doubt it will win any awards. | Игра не плоха, огорчает лишь тот факт - что в неё почти что никто не играет. Так что речи о полноценном геймплеи к сожалению речи не идёт.

I remembered having a lot of fun with this game - hardly any long queue times, and so long as people knew how to play, the games were generally entertaining and fun. Even better though if people really leaned into the Roleplaying aspects.

This was all a long time ago though...
Then I joined the Official Discord and after a week had one of the Official ToS Moderators start private DM'ing me and harassing me into joining a Loli Hentai Discord server. I still have this interaction screen-shotted and can still access the DM's.

76561198032898393,276810,Mordheim: City of the Damned,3.716666666666667,"RPG, Strategy",5,"This game goes on sale for $2 six months of the year (can check “steam db price history”) and it is more than worth it. If you’re reading reviews, just pull the trigger and buy it. 

Mordheim City of the Damned is an unappreciated diamond in the rough. I just discovered it a month ago after all these years, and it more than stands the test of time in both gameplay and visuals. The people that left bad reviews for this game either don’t understand probability (complaining about AI “cheating” cause they missed missing 2 80% chance to hit attacks in a row) or weren’t in the right mind space to play the game thinking every unit is an unkillable god and getting upset when units die or become crippled. I believe a good approach to this game for a new player is to treat it like Darkest Dungeon; understand that characters are going to die, you’ll get attached and lose units you care about for reasons mostly out of your control, and while the game is hard initially yes, that’s part of the enjoyment. The whole game’s system is built off of you overcoming disadvantageous odds, which makes victory more sweet and giving units the opportunity to carve their own path and make clutch plays/stories defending off 3 units etc. 

If you want to see gameplay for Mordheim or informational content on it, I recommended checking out MercyTheMad on YT and/or Twitch. He doesn’t make videos on the game but he still streams this game on and off and is very informative, yet fun to watch. Also highly recommend lordramon2019 on Twitch as he has almost 8000 hours in mordheim, has hosted almost every PvP tournament for the game, and streams Mordheim a couple times a week. 

I never write reviews for games but seeing this one had mixed reviews, I had to say something. | I wholeheartedly recommend this game!

The negatives of this game are the minor bugs it has (at least for me), a low player count, repetitive gameplay, and what looks to be no updates and support. There is also sometimes genuine heartbreak when losing a character or having them injured to the point where their main strengths are negated. There is one story mission for the Chaos cult faction that is nearly impossible but that's just one mission for one faction.

The positives are that the gameplay is addictive, challenging, and well thought out. The atmosphere created by the music and visuals are on point. The factions are fun and unique (still wish there were more). You can play the game very simply and do okay or you can min/max and strategize to your hearts content. You have a lot of choices both in a match and out of one. The developers also made the most of the maps that exist so it rarely feels like it's the same experience over and over again.

I love turn-based strategy games and this one allows for so much customization, gameplay options, and ultimately playability. Don't get me wrong, the game can be punishing, especially in the early game when your warband is weak and you don't know what you are doing. But it is so rewarding leveling up your own little squad as they venture into the hellscape that is Mordheim! I do recommend all of the DLC (extra factions and characters) to give yourself as many options to play the game as possible. I got it for quite cheap on sale so would recommend doing the same. | The random number generator isn't!!!! This game had a lot of up-side and potential. but falls short on fun and pliability when good tactics see your Waveband devastated. I once missed a 5 95% hits in a row and the AI dodged the 6th. Play it or not. I loved the table top game, this sets up faster but play is lacking. Where are the dwarf's and other raises of the world. Typical GM 75% is what you get. | It's fun but the early game is really brutal and the level scailing system somehow make endgame missions easier than said early game.

It has still a lot of potential and could use a few updates, reworks and DLCs or even a sequel. It also need a lot more story missions. | This is fun but it needs a lot of work. The game tries to constantly keep you underpowered forevery fight as a means of keeping the game challenging and to keep you from progressing too fast. The game is really fun at first until you realize the game design and it just feels like the game wastes your time on purpose and prevents you from progressing. When you do finally progress and seem to have some experienced and geared fighters, the game always puts the enemies just slightly more powerful than your units and your always at risk of losing a unit forever. It just feels bad to lose a guy you spend 10-30 games on trying to gear and level and it doesnt even feel like a mistake you made. This game should have been a lot better but even at $2 I was pretty let down."

It's quite a bit bigger than either of those examples, and much like Templar Battleforce, you could probably spend hundreds of hours optimising your crew and ship.

That said, much like Templar Battleforce, it's not remotely clear why you'd really want to do that, and there's not much in game to help you figure anything out. It is very much a Trese Brothers game, and you will love it or hate it accordingly.

I'd suggest it's a good buy at $10. Play for two hours -  just do the quest, but skip the dialog (or you won't get very far into it). It's likely you will die and not get much done, but it will give you a good feel for what the core gameplay loop is like as much of that is touched on in that first quest. | I really tried to like this game, however I can't get into it
Main problem is balance. Game is too easy or too difficult. Nothing in-between. Battle skills are useless because in easy fights you don't need them and in difficult ones - they won't save you. 
Also dice roll mechanic is complicated so it's barely understandable. Therefore the player doesn't know if one has high or low chances of success

What did Positech mean by this | Democracy 3 to gra głęboka jak kałuża nawet nie ma mapy i każda gra wygląda tak samo ogólnie nie polecam | De los mejores juegos de gestión de un país que se puede probar. Cada edición mejora. | mac oyunculuğunun mihenk taşı, Democracy serisi! (mac'e çıkmayan 4'ü saymıyorum...).

Democracy 3; karışık bir arayüze sahip, kolay bir oyun. Dengeleri iyi korumanız lazımmış gösteren ama o kadar da olmayan bir oyun. Tam olarak arafı yaşatıyor size. Radikal sol olabilirsiniz, piyasacı olabilirsiniz vs. Çok esktrem ayarlarda oynamadığınız müddetçe devamlı %50 üstü oyda seyir ediyorsunuz.

76561198032898393,351050,Cricket Captain 2015,12.966666666666667,"Simulation, Sports",4,"As always, this is an excellent cricket simulation game. Unlike the last few versions, this one has some much needed new features/improvements. To name just a few, the added Indian domestic leagues (which will please many). The ODI and T20 match engines have notably improved with much larger scores now possible. The lesser teams like Bangladesh and Zimbabwe have been given more attention leading to more accurate team selections. There are many more little improvements for the better that you will find out as you play the game.

Overall, I honestly think this is a game to get for any cricket fan. 

 | Cricket Captain 2015, the same game every year with given a tiny application of makeup and making no progress whatsoever. 

The thing is, Cricket Captain is basically a Cricket Manager game, minus 90% of management features that are needed to make the game interesting. But let me get the pro's out of the way with first;

The match engine is brilliant, the statistical information available to the player is brilliant. The one-day and 20-20 match engines have been tweaked and are better than previous instalments. Graphics have finally gotten a facelift, but animations remain the same as in previous versions pretty much, thus edges mostly go in the same areas and not always to shots that make sense.

To demonstrate the laziness; the animations for the umpires to signal 'byes' is the real life signal for leg byes, this has been like this for the past three or four instalments, it can't be that hard to fix surely?

Outside of the match engine, there is almost nothing for an aspiring manager to do. Yeah, there is team building from the transfer market, and the promotion of youth players. You also get to adjust the budgets a little, but the initial funding doesn't change (aside from prize money), there's no opportunity to build the club up as you become more successful. There's no chance to look more in depth at a youth or reserve team, and you can't hire a specific number of physios or coaches. Training is limited, staff numbers are linked to the budget but never anymore than numbers rather than actual personalities themselves - a batting coach who is aggressive for example, or a bowling coach with his own philosophy - nope, they're just generic numbers.

And that, really is the problem with the game. It's a spreadsheet game, with all your time spent looking at statistical averages. Best batsman number 1 will always be replaced by generic youth product number 51, because there are no personalities in the game, nothing to indicate ability (outside of averages), nothing to indicate talent (outside of averages) because there's no staff to talk to, no youth team to develop and team to mould in line with bigger games such as Football Manager.

The whole thing, is just a numbers game without any real flavour to it. The hardcore fans and cricket nuts will pick it up as usual, but aside from reading the numbers and possibly playing around with tactics in the admittedly decent match engine there's nothing outside to keep things interesting, no media, no discussions, no personalities, training events or anything that adds spark and interest. Nothing but your imagination and the bland numbers popping up as each match goes by.

For a series that has been around for a long while now, they really need to get with the times and produce something more than a match engine. | Cricket Captain 2015 follows exactly the same format and game play as every previous version going back 15 years.  The only noticeable changes are to the graphics on the highlights.  These however, still look very poor and dated.

Everything else remains the same as previous versions and this new release follows the same path of them updating stats whilst keeping the gameplay and interface identical to previous versions.   You can also now play the Indian FC league too.  

If you already own a recent version of cricket captain then this new version is little more than a database update.  If you don't own a previous version then it is worth buying as it is still a fun game although after years of very little development to the actual game play it does feel a very tired series now. | So if you're like me and the Ashes buzz has made you want to get a Cricket game and you remember a game called Cricket Captain... you come to this. Well luckily for you, it's easy to navigate around because absolutely nothing has changed in about 5 years. Everything is the same except for the obvious player names, a few more teams and updated statistics.

If you play other management games such as Football Manager or Pro Cycling Manager, there's somesort of an improvement year on year and you'd expect that from pretty much every game you play but this, i actually can't find anything new at all. It's so dated and i've tried to get into it but i just can't. Not recommended if you're looking for Crickets answer to Football Manager | I have loved the Cricket Captain series for a long time, and I buy it every couple of years. This version is as much fun as always and looks a good deal slicker than previous versions, which is great.

I still feel like the series is a little lazy, especially when compared with sports management simulators where there is more competition - e.g. Football Manager. A few small changes could make this series so much better.

One major failing is that it is impossible to be sacked or to move counties or countries once you have started a game. I think it would be great if the Board of your team (domestic or international) set seasonal goals and would review your position based on your attainment of the goals. These could be based around performance in competitions, development of youth players, marquee signings, or anything like this. Similarly, fan satisfaction would be a great feature - are the fans happy with the performance of the team; are the attached to the players; do they like the style of cricket you're playing? If so, more fans should turn up to games and the county should make more money.

In international cricket, each country's pool of talent seems to remain fairly static despite retirals and regenerations. This has in the past been frustrating as a New Zealand fan. There should also be a mechanism for a team's prestige to change, so that if you manage NZ or WI or whoever to be the no.1 side in a format, other teams will want to host longer and more regular series against your team. It is frustrating to have a great player in a New Zealand shirt who can't have a real crack at breaking records because he'll only play 60 tests in his career. It should also be possible to move international teams to keep variety and interest.

I love the statistical elements of this game, especially that retired player stats are now saved. The kind of people who love cricket and play these games love statistics, so keep them coming! The more the better! For example, saving players' scoring areas over the whole of their career, saving as many quirky stats as possible about your nation or club (e.g. all time best XIs, players of the season, most runs/wickets in a 2/3/4/5 match test/ODI/T20I series, most matches, most matches as captain, boundary totals, most % runs in innings, etc). 

I'd also love to see Decision Reviews introduced (a really important part of captaincy these days), and realistic rain delays in one-day cricket with Duckworth-Lewis adjusted totals.

A few small changes like this would make the game feel more real, more immersive, and ultimately more enjoyable.

Still, I love this series, and would give this game four out of five stars."
76561198032898393,352890,Caravan,0.75,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",1,"I played this game for who knows how many hours in GoG. This used to be a challenging game. It's more of an exploration/trading game, now. It's still a good game, but I was not sliding in on empty over and over again, wondering where I would get the money to level-up. I found it far less challenging this time. 

You play the heir to the throne of Iram, whose mum and dad have both disappeared, leaving you with a charmed pendant, which you wear around your neck. You acquire steeds and slaves (although the slaves are not called slaves, given that I can buy and sell them, they are slaves) to help you fight off dangers and transport your goods. You buy low and sell high, of course.

There is, however, an underlying story-line. You are trying to find-out what happened to your parents and lift the curse that has befallen your kingdom. To start this story-line, you must make yourself a reliable caravan master, then seek-out the Queen of Sheba and speak with her.

You can play a good, evil, or neutral character in this game, btw. Your choices are what define that, however, as far as I remember, the consequences are always immediate, not long-term. | On one hand I wouldn't necessarily recommend Caravan because it's INCREDIBLY niche...BUT I did enjoy playing it for what it was.

Caravan is a short (but padded) game where you take your trading caravan around the pre-islamic Arabian Peninsula and revolves around the lost city 'Iram of the Pillars' and how you, as it's prince, return it's former glory.

Caravan is not an open trading game such as Patrician or Port Royale but more a story driven game with the trading mechanics tieing it together. Combat and haggling are handled with a rock/paper/scissors style dice game which is functional if not especially engaging. The story missions are fine and each chapter will unlock more cities in Arabia to travel around ultimately leading you full circle.

Game-play wise you're probably looking at 6-8 hours but I did spend more than that dossing around as a trader just because.

I could envision a game where the mechanics of Caravan are worked into a full on trading game and it would be nice to see in a potential 'Caravan 2' should such a thing ever exist. | BEN ARAP MIYIM YA, TÜRK OĞLU TÜRKÜM BEN | Basically Oregon Trail in the Medieval times. | [h2]Caravan[/h2]

The only things I don't like about this game is the lack of garbage treatment. There is only a garbage landfill and a garbage incineration plant. When you have a lot of citizens producing a lot of trash it is very hard to stop it from happening since the garbage landfills barely do anything, and when it happens for too long more abandoned buildings will show up which are really annoying to bulldoze. 
      
     People who like to be the leader and take charge, like me, would enjoy playing Cities:Skylines 2. I really enjoy the fact that whenever your bored you can just start a new world and flood your city with poo.
     
     You can do everything from creating road plans to raising taxes, laying down pipe to terraforming an entire mountain surrounding your city. This game is definitely for those aspiring to be an engineer but don't want the complexity of it.
     
      The first time I bought Cities:Skylines 1 i was so eager and I was talking about it for days because I watch RealCivilEngineer play Cities:Skylines, and I was just immediately captivated by the possibilities of what my city can become. This game is definitely for the people who are creative and want to express the creativity in the form of building your own city.
    
      All in all Cities:Skylines 1 is a great game for beginners learning to be a engineer but for people who want better graphics, mechanics, building, and plays on windows, definitely go for Cities:Skylines 2.

      If the devs happening to be reading this, please make Cities:Skylines 2 available to play on Mac. It was very frustrating buying Cities:Skylines 2 the realizing that it was for windows only, and the pain I felt realizing that I couldn't play it and waiting for it to be refunded. But at least I have Cities:Skylines 1 I can play with less features and worse graphics even though I want to be an Engineer.

Still better than Cities Skylines 2, Mods are carrying hard. | After 532 hours of meticulously laying roads, zoning districts, and perfecting public transit routes, I can safely say that Cities: Skylines is a city-building masterpiece that deserves every second of your time. The level of detail and control you have over the growth and management of your city is both addicting and rewarding. Each decision from budget allocations to traffic flow is crucial to maintaining a thriving metropolis that feels genuinely alive. The base game already offers an extensive toolkit, but the robust modding community truly takes things to the next level with endless possibilities for customization. If you love city builders or simulation games, Cities: Skylines is absolutely worth playing.

While it's not a close replica of the Space Hulk game I mentioned, I still found this game to be pretty fun, alone or with friends. And the daily missions, the weekly ""hardcore mode"" missions with leaderboards, and built-in map editor increases the replay value greatly for me.

This game has online play, also has local split-screen for up to 2-4 players for those that love couch coop and remote play together too.

The only thing I wish this game had is some kind of ""Squad Mode"" where you are a leader that commands AI teammates to do your bidding and trying to survive as many missions as possible with whatever teammates you have left and so forth. There's not a lot of games like that these days that allow you to command AI teammates, would be cool to have in this game.

Regardless, I recommend this game. | INFESTATION

Sure, the graphics are generally nice enough, but on the whole the gameplay still feels a tad ""clunky"", the story and associated artwork in the cut scenes is ""clunkier"" still, and the voice acting is...well, actually, the voice acting itself isn't that bad, but the quality of the voice RECORDING (please tell me that was a cheap USB mike you used) does nothing to dilute the faintly ""amateurish"" nature of the whole endeavour.  

   Now, none of this is to say that there isn't potential here, and I'll certainly give the game points for ambition and originality.  But it all just left me feeling underawed and unenthused about delving any further than the fourth level.  Is it a ""bad"" game?  No, not as far as I can tell.  Some of you may even love it.  I didn't, and gave it nearly an hour of my precious life, and for now I'm putting the board back in its box and looking for other virtual ""dice"" to throw.  In all fairness to the devs, I'm yet to try multiplayer, but in all fairness to myself, I rarely enjoy multiplayer anyway, and it's hardly the sort of game you could ""jump into"" with friends without each of you tutoring yourselves in the basics first, anyway.  I actually feel faintly bad about giving this a thumbs-down - it's a borderline ""fail"" at worst, in my book - but I can't in all good conscience go thumbing up things which lost my interest in just a little over thirty minutes, can I now?  Maybe I'll return to it one day, maybe I won't.  

   One thing I'm confident in opining:  The twenty dollar price-tag is certainly a tad ludicrous.  If there IS an audience out there for this game, it's hardly liable to find it when such an ""indie"" game is being sold at such a non-""indie"" price.  My advice to anyone who thinks they still might be interested:  Watch some walkthroughs, wait for the price to drop a little, and nab it in a sale.  Then you won't have wasted TOO much moolah if you find it isn't to your liking.  As it stands, a definite gamble...

Verdict: 4.5/10. | I recommend this game with reservations. 

It has some very cool things going for it. First off, if you are a fan of board games (like me) then this definitely scratches that particular itch, most of the time. There are a handful of levels in the story mode that are distinctively puzzles - that is to say, you don't really roll the dice or draw cards but rather attempt to play the dice and cards that you are are prescribed in the correct (and only correct) order to succeed the only way possible. These levels, for me, are the weakest part of the game. Yes, there is satisfaction from figuring out the solution - and you will have to figure it out, the game isn't big enough to be able to find any walkthroughs for - but the frustration begins to set in quickly when you realize that you want to play a tabletop board game, not a puzzle.

Also, the RNG is often unfair. Now, let me clarify that I LOVE randomness in games. My favorite board games are Ameritrash style (Camp Grizzly, Fortune and Glory, Marvel Legendary, I could go on and on) and my favorite pen and paper RPGs are ones with random character generation (Heroes Unlimited, TMNT, well, anything old-school Palladium) so I am not at all one of those people who screams with rage every time he sees a game with RNG elements. However this game does sometimes take it a little far. Example: I was once tasked with killing two enemies who start out in the same room as each other on the opposite side of the map from me. After ten or so failed attempts I just happened to start the game with a Sentinel card in my hand. I placed a Sentinel in their room. Bam, two dead enemies in one round and I never had to leave my starting square. There were other times that the RNG had a similar sort of play against me. And as much as I love randomness, it is simply not fair to win or lose before you (or your opponent) even get to make a turn.

Finally, the voice acting is tolerable, but the voice casting is atrocious. And if you don't know the difference, imagine if Bobcat Goldthwait had been cast as Groot. Sure, he could have said the lines, but it would have sounded ridiculous. I have the same problem here - Sajotir in particular just sounds silly.

Now, I have bashed the game on three seperate criteria, but recognize that both the first and third issues only affect Single Player Story Mode, and frankly, board games like this are never as fun unless you're playing with friends. Also, both are small issues. I can overlook some bad voicing especially since you only hear the voices during the between-mission cutscenes. I can overlook some puzzle missions since they are not the majority. And while some will never get over the RNG issues, they were not enough to kill my entertainment completely.

So, if you are a fan of board games and tactical games that require you to rethink strategies on the fly to deal with random elements, then this game is definitely worth picking up.
 | If you have a high tolerance to frustration then you can pretty much ignore this review.  There's some bad art and some cringe-worthy voice acting but otherwise it's an interesting game where the Dungeon is a player in the game and it can change and add enemies to suit itself.

However if endless clicking on confirmation dialogs whilst you replay the same level - hoping to not get screwed by the random number generator - is not your thing you might want to read on.

First let's look at what should been obviously left out.  Seriously, stuff that's been added to the game that makes it worse.

Confirmations for everything.  Why does the game world disappear to be replaced by a (terribly drawn) picture of the character whose turn is about to start?  Why must I confirm that their turn is about to start?  Many, many party based RPGs and squad based games have come and gone without the need to acknowledge the start of every single party member's turn.

Similarly for confimations of the end of the turn.  If there is nothing left to do then is it really necessary to ask if I really mean to end the turn.  Further why do I have to end the turn at all if there's nothing left to do in the turn.  Move to the next character in sequence like in every RPG ever.

It may seem odd that I'm picking on something so seemingly trivial as a few extra mouse clicks but there is a bit more to it than that.  Restarting levels is a slow affair as they don't restart from the point of action.  All cinematics and pre-play character banter have to be watched again too.  Skipping cinematics is odd as the mouse must be held down to grow a ball before the cinematic can be skipped.  Skipping the character banter is downright irritating as there is no 'skip all' option and input seems to be ignored for a small time after every mouse click.  I did not enjoy re-reading the same inane dialogue again and again.

Which brings me to my next point.  The voice acting is bad.  The recording is low quality and the delivery is even worse.  You're not going to be wanting to hear it ever time a stage starts.

And speaking of stage restarts:  why do I have to roll the dice at the start of each turn?  Rolling the dice is an action that always happens but it is slow and shouldn't need to be presented to the player.  I, sort of, understand it in Tavern Mode as it suits the feel of a tavern but for Dungeon Mode - which is the game default - it doesn't make sense. 

Cameras and room manipulation buttons.  The buttons to manipulate a room; i.e: rotate it or swap it, appear on the edges of the room.  The camera pans to the room that the mouse is currently over (there is no other way of panning).  Think about that for a moment.  If you move the mouse into an adjacent room whilst trying to hit a button on the edge of another room then the whole map will scroll and the wrong rooms buttons will be selected.  Why does moving the mouse into a room focus on that room at all?  What was wrong with decades of games that have allowed the player to manually pan the map?  Why are none of the buttons or keys rebindable?  What was the reason for rotating the map up and down at all?  Why can't I use shortcut keys to select the dice?

Living Dungeon really does not feel like it was made to be played with a mouse and keyboard.  The implementation is awful.

Generally the 3D models in Living Dungeon are good and show adequate detail in high resolutions (HD and above).  The 2D art is another story.  I mentioned it was terrible at the start of this review.  It is, even at middling resolutions.  It's amateur and looks like it was drawn by someone who was just starting to learn about layers and transparency in photoshop.  The game would be better off if there was the option to just turn it all off completely, it's not needed.   Actually it's what pushed me intro writing this review.  

Having to stare at jaggy badly cutout poorly drawn character art whilst waiting for the turn  confirmation screen to finally accept my confirmation click was, I found, more irritating than I could deal with.

Lastly the randomness of throws seems to swamp any skill based play; be prepared to replay levels.  I'm done.  Play Space Hulk instead. | I had to change my review. First I wanted to say THIS DEV TEAM IS AWESOME!!!!.. I had some slight technical issues with the game and I felt the pricing was to high. I got a message from one of the devs by the name of zenorf, he explained to me a bit more on how the camera worked in the game.

The game is no longer over priced. It use to be 19.99 now it's only 12.99, I think that's a great price for this game.

When I play the game in Tavern mode there is some blur on the lower part of the screen which makes it hard to view your pieces and the game dice, I was told by zenorf he would look into a toggle for it, so we can turn it off or on. The camera controls gave me some problems at first, but that was do to my lack of understand all the controls for it, zenorf explained to me that a simple middle mouse click on my character zooms in on them, allowing me to move around the board much better. Zooming in on your character also makes the blur far less of a hassle.

I highly recommend this game for anyone who loves board games, table top rpgs, working with friends or screwing them over for some laughs. It's a lot of fun playing online or offline with friends. If you're a solo player you can play that way too, so no matter how you like to play your tabletop the devs have a way for you to do it.

The game itself is simple to learn but it can be a real test of strategy too. It's easily one of my favorite games right now.

P.S. some Gamers are upset that the game didn't originally have online multiplayer, but that was never an issue with me. I knew the game was going to be local multiplayer cause it said so in the game description. I prefer local multiplayer to be honest.

The devs added online multiplayer, so if you like that, that might be a reason for you to buy it.

This game is worth a buy. I'm very happy with it. | The game is a mix of dungeon twister, heroquest and maybe spacehulk

I like it. It is mostly a puzzle game in story mode but the local MP is good with various combos available. E.g. one player as DM against the rest; 2p deathmatch with an AI DM

I recommend getting it during this summer sale"

I am not a professional tactician and do not play strategy games.

[h2]Pros[/h2]
[list]
[*] It's a phenomenal idea that does what it needs to
[*] Lots of customization and micro-management possible
[*] Lots of missions and ability to progress
[*] Side-challenges reward persistence and experimentation
[/list]
[h2]Cons[/h2]
[list]
[*] Units will think that they cant have their weapon drawn when they can. This results in a lot of situations where you think you should be able to have your weapon out but you can't (resulting in failure)
[*] It is incredibly hard to get units to swing/pie a doorway without manually controlling them while they swing; it's incredibly unintuitive. Like I know what I want to do but I have no clue how to get that to happen
[*] Navigation isn't phenomenal and doing tight manuevers doesn't always work the way you'd hope them to
[*] Having to unlock more powerful guns by playing more missions is stupid in this case. I'm encountering an issue where my shield operator is significantly behind the rest of the squad because his pistol is really shitty and has poor stopping power.
[*] Game is slightly unintuitive; it doesn't feel like stuff is really explained to me directly. I would've appreciated a more direct tutorial that holds your hand through actions rather than just a ""How to Play"" button
[*] I honestly don't think grading off of time is a fun concept. A lot of whether you win a fight sometimes can feel like total luck and playing safely is playing SLOW. You do better working slowly rather than speeding through a level.

[b]Overall[/b], Door Kickers is a alright game that has been made obsolete since Door Kickers 2 exists. I have not played DK2, but from watching gameplay of it, it seems that all the cons I've listed here are gone in the next game. And since DK2 appears to be just DK1 but Better, there's not much point in buying this game. [b]HOWEVER, since this game goes on deep sales relatively often, it can still be a fun time-waster or a good demo to see if you would like the much more expensive, rarely-and-barely-on-sale DK2.[/b] So buy this on sale if you want to get a taste of what Door Kickers is like, but probably buy DK2 if this game really strikes a chord with you. | Amazing and entertaining game. For this game, you have to go to the roster and switch to assault, instead of using the default pointman. The assault type can use MP5 guns which take down bad guys quicker. Using assault the game becomes easier and more fun, as you can take down the bad guys better. And I don't plan at one go, as the position of the enemies will change. I clear the areas step by step, pausing in between, and watching the action. | Do you like the planning part of Rainbow Six games, but hate actually participating in the FPS part?  This is the game for you. | 好玩爱玩,制定战术,突突一波,无伤统统枪毙太优雅了,太爽了!!! | At full price, I don't find Door Kickers to be all that outstanding. Yet you can buy it for a couple of bucks when it's on a deep sale and get literally hundreds of missions, community-made maps, and even your own level editor, all packaged into a top-down strategy SWAT game where you can either pre-plan every move your SWAT team makes or painstakingly move every individual member by yourself. And while I don't think there is enough gameplay diversity or depth to keep me invested for more than about half a dozen / a dozen hours, I'd still recommend spending a couple of bucks and trying it out if it looks like a game you might enjoy.

The game has a pretty steep learning curve, does not hold your hand, or offer much in the form of guidance.  But it is oh so rewarding when you do get the hang of it and are able to take on the more challenging battles the game has to offer.

My favorite Turn-Based Strategy game ever.  If you're on the fence, play this and profit. | This game is the equivalent of your abusive uncle that somehow always comes back to the family gathering. An average game looks like this:
-Start a new company with a cool name, a dope banner, and even some backstory in mind
-Go into the first town that has strangled trade routes, has been raided recently, and is somehow inhabited by exclusively anti-sellsword activists
-Get your first contract
-Get decapitated by a graverobber high on hyena acid

10/10 would visit the abusive uncle again. | A very fun and equally frustrating game. I cannot stress enough how much I recommend starting on the beginner difficulty, otherwise there is a high chance you will rage quit and conclude that the game is poorly balanced. Even on beginner, there will be times where it feels like the RNG is legitimately out to get you, but other times it feels like a miracle how much it seems to be in your favor. 

It's a hard game and you will likely find yourself reloading saves but its also a quite well made and in depth turn based combat game. It feels very rewarding as you evolve from a group of losers barely scraping by to a small army full of hardened combatants. | This game is pretty much turn based mount and blade, which is not really a good thing. Like M&B, I had fun for awhile, until i realized that there is nothing tactical about the game and every battle becomes pretty repetitive. The game starts every battle with your sides in two lines within almost one turns movement distance. Very tactical. I know I would deploy my guys right up there within range of archers. The terrain for each battle is generated upon entering the battle, so you may start the battle with your back against a hill. Did my guys march right down a hill and start battle at the foot of the hill my enemies are on. Very Tactical. The game kind of treats armor and shields as a second health bar, so it just becomes swinging attrition. The only bonus you get for placement of troops is a mild accuracy bonus. Mild. So you surround a guy with a shield and he somehow blocks every swing with a shield until the shield is destroyed. Then do the same for armor. Tactical as hell. Yes some weapons deal more damage to shields or armor, but ultimately it is still a very shallow ""tactical"" experience. | Fun Game! Challenging, with a learning curve to it. Not crazy though. On the surface seems simple, but takes some time to learn the depth. I am still getting the hang of it. If you like turn based games, with depth, then this is the game for you."

Look, if you like bomberman this game will blow your socks off. It's just great fun.


What makes it different from Bomberman?

-Your characters have unique special moves such as dash (gets you out of trouble quick) or you put up a 4x4 fence in an area you shoot at, trapping those inside or protecting yourself.. (these moves charge up, so you cant spam)

- Gore! lol

-Modes like sumo, trying to knock each other off the board


Basically it's bomberman with superpowers, even wheelchairs 


Downsides to the game?
- It's depressing, where as bomberman is happyland. It sounds silly but after some time goes by you feel the gloomy atmosphere start to hit... Maybe it's just me? The maps are great and suit the games feel sure, but they do have an impact to your psych lol

- Bomberman has more level customisation. You seem to have lives and see who can get the most kills within the changeable time limits. Sometimes I just want to play last man standing but havent spotted any way to do that. Will edit if I find it

76561198032898393,369580,NotTheNameWeWanted,0.0,Casual,0,"""NotTheNameWeWanted"" ist ein satirisches Snake Spiel.

Einst hieß dieses absurde Spielchen ""NOTGTAV"", aber aus naheliegenden Gründen gab es Probleme mit den Namensrechten. Deshalb heißt das Spiel nun ""NotTheNameWeWanted"". Ein bißchen absurd in Bezug darauf, daß eine Verwechslung kaum möglich ist und das Spielchen auch überall mehr als deutlich darauf hinwies, daß es nicht ""GTA"" ist und auch nichts damit zu tun hat. Ein Beweis für die extreme Humorlosigkeit von Rockstar. 

Das Spielchen hat auch mit ""GTA"" kaum etwas zu tun. Spielmechanisch schon gar nicht. Denn es ist einfach nur ein Snake Spiel. Auf einem einzigen Screen bewegen wir aus der Draufsicht ein Gefährt und überfahren Dinge, die sich uns nachher als Schwanz anschließen, so daß ein Navigieren - ohne daß wir irgendwo anstoßen - stets schwieriger wird. Extrem simpel, extrem unspektakulär, extrem altmodisch. 

Und doch macht das Spielchen Spaß. Das liegt allerdings nicht primär an der Mechanik, sondern an dem britisch-satirischen Humor, der anarchisch absurd daherkommt und der vor allem eines ist: grundsympathisch. So soll man zum Beispiel einen Skateboarder möglichst schnell überfahren bevor er in der Lage ist, einen eigenen Youtube-Channel aufzumachen. Ständiges Ziel satirischer Kommentare ist David Cameron, einst Premierminister Großbritanniens. 

Einen großen Teil zur Komik tragen mundgemachter Sound und handgemachte Grafik bei. Bewußt dilettantisch sind die schnell selbst gezeichneten Grafiken, die  auch ein Fünfjähriger nicht schlechter hingekriegt hätte. Die Sounds sind größtenteils selbst eingesprochen. Die Effekte und auch die Musik sind mit einem solchen Enthusiasmus eingesprochen, daß man allein durch diese immer wieder ein Grinsen nicht unterdrücken kann. 

""NotTheNameWeWanted"" sollte als das genommen werden, was es ist. Ein kleines satirisches Spielchen mit gelungenem Humor, das kurze Zeit Spaß macht und das weder die Welt noch sich selber ernst nimmt.

76561198032898393,374150,Concealed Intent,2.45,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",1,"I'm editing this review based on the updates to the game and my interactions with the dev. No review copies, etc., are involved. 

Initially, I basically said this is a very good game, especially for short sessions but needed more features to be worth the price. To keep things short and sweet - it is an excellent (coffee-break) game and is well worth the price. But it's also a very solid and innovative strategy title in terms of game design, but still simple, clear, and fun, with considerable depth. Also, the dev is really nice and very committed...it's clear that this is a labor of love. 

+ great skirmish mode, with ability to choose loadout of yours + enemy's ship(s)
+ new skirmish options, some gameplay types added
+ AI has been improved and is really solid as far as I have been able to see. Initially I would win ""even"" matches hands-down...now usually really tight matches
+ you can now have matchups with more than 1 ship per side
+ other cool options like minefields, etc.
+ matches are tense, but not stressful
+ simple but elegant gameplay and art design

- AI could be improved some in some areas (e.g., stealth loadouts)
- would be great to see more options/mission types (only 2 ATM)
- good tooltips, but still not always easy to really ""get"" the finer points of the mechanics without some poking around, or how different mechanics impact play 
- couple effects / sounds coule be improved (others are good)



The old review is still somewhat relevant and is found below, though some comments have been addressed above.




First off, the game is a great coffee-break game (5-20 mins) - better than most of that kind. Both the importance of spotting enemy vessels and avoiding being spotted yourself, etc., which even now works very well, and the depth of difference between ship types make it a lot smarter game than other space-fleet titles. I started by playing with Corvettes on both sides, which seems to be a well-rounded vessel, and won handily enough. Then, I tried fighting against a Corvette as an Interceptor, a much weaker ship with good stealth options. Winning even once took a dozen tries or so, and even with the same ship, each loadout played differently. Trying a third ship tonight, I was again struck by how differently the game played out. 

To really make the title shine, here is what I would like to see changed:

1. Better tooltips - There just isn't enough info at present for mouse-over tooltips...as a new player, it's hard to see what different stuff will do, which is frustrating to have to test out.

2. Improved AI - This isn't to say that the AI is bad, but it seems unbalanced. Sometimes it feels crafty at evading or closing, etc. However, when I played against a stealth ship, it didn't seem to turn on its ECM stealth system even once - which basically made victory in that match-up impossible.

3. More skirmish options - Currently you can play a handful of maps with 1-1 matches of various ships (which can each carry multiple drones). While the game probably isn't optmized for more, and the small number plays better, it would be nice at least to have the option to have small fleets face each other. Also, at present you can't change the AI's loadout - it would be nice to have the option for that along with auto-selection. Etc.

4. Skirmish mission types - I almost never play campaign games, and even then would want replayability of a healthy skirmish mode. Having different simple mission types like station assault, escort, etc., would add a lot of bang for the buck in terms of depth and replayability.

If you are looking for something to fill the odd 10-minute time slot or a game with short but fulfilling matches, this one is good and you will need your brain to play. I'm just not sure how long it can capture gamers' interest with the current amount of features. | Too simple and not very much strategy/counterplay. Plays more or less like XCOM without levelling or cover. Also reliant on a stealth mechanism, but does not show whether your ships are detected or not, which can get frustrating. The story/campaign is also pretty bad, something about ""My uncle was killed by pirates and then I saw a hacker at first he wouldn't help me but then I shot him and he helped me yay."" I recommend Battle for Wesnoth, XCOM, or Magic the Gathering (using XMage) instead if you want a 1v1 turn based strategy game. | Type of game: Stealth based tactics game done right. By this I mean take a tactical rpg add in stealth game elements and remove the rpg elements. I know some other games have tried this by bringing over detection cones used in real time stealth games and it didn't work so well. The developer of this game gets around that and introduces stealth mechanics to a turn based tactical game in a way that is appropriate to the genre.

Paragraph version of review:

Just started playing but I'm already impressed. If you look on the forums the dev gives a nice detailed answer about what type of game the game is, but in short think of a tactical rpg, minus the rpg (i.e. no leveling, farming currency etc) - so just a tactics game, although unused supplies are carried over from one mission to the next. The detection side of it is a nice new idea for a genre that's needed something like that for a long time and adds another layer of depth. Right now my only real concern is that there might not be a lot of content but I'll update this after I have played some more. In any case it's worth a look even if it's just for the mechanics it introduces, particular if on sale and may or may not be worth the price tag dependent upon how much content there is - unfortunately I'm a little worried that if I was to sit down and play it straight through for a weekend that I would have played through everything it has to offer in a day or two but hopefully that's just a false first impression. Also that's really not how I'm inclined to play this game. Missions are more like combat puzzles and are the type of thing I'm inclined to play one or two at a time and then come back to it a few days (or even weeks) later.

List Version of Review:

Pros:
+Lots of good mechanics for a tactics game - not only the stealth/detection aspect, but weapon damage degrades with distance instead of relying on hit chances for this (although there are hit chances, but as far as I can tell these aren't based on distance from target aside from how distance from target plays into detection). Pretty much anything you care about that should be related to distance between targets has reasonable nonlinear relations and you have easy access to detailed information on these (in the form of graphs, which actually works really well for this). I really can't praise this enough with respect to its tactical mechanics
+Great interface - there is lots of information readily available that you don't have to go digging through menus to find, weapon damage, detection, how visible your ships are etc are not only easy to find but easy to see breakdowns of why they are the way they are.
+Runs smoothly, with minimal bugs - my only complain here so far is that if you try to move too close to where an object (ship, asteroid etc) already is rather than just stopping you from moving the path closer it jumps to a seemingly random location on the map.
+Easy controls that only take a little bit of getting use to.
+Truly 3D tactical combat.
+Doesn't rely on hexes, squares etc. movement and distances are actually measured. As much as I enjoy games that do use these and I think it's a reasonable simplification to tile a plane its nice when you run into a game that implements distances in a non-simplified manner and does it well.

Potential Con:
-Might not have that much content.
-AI might not play that well - hopefully this is just in the first couple of missions and it gets harder. It does look like their is a hard AI setting available in skirmish mode so hopefully this is a non-issue.
-Only one difficulty setting.

Overall:
As a first impression the game has tons of potential, but I'm worried it's not going to live up to it because of too little content and too easy of an opponent. If it gets a good multiplayer community going though both of those might not be an issue.

Update: It looks like there are a pretty good array of modes for skirmish so that certainly adds a bit to the amount of content. There are 17 solo missions available and if you beat them all on the first go it would probably be reasonable to beat all of them within a day. That said that's assuming that you can beat them all on the first go without a lot of planning and even a few in I'd say the difficulty is reasonable - managable but certaintly not easy to play through quickly unless you already have a good tactic in mind for the mission.

Additional difficulty modes for the story missions would be nice (i.e. harder modes have more/better ships or even better yet the AI plays better). | It seemed like such a good plan, at first. A beam-equipped Heavy Drone to act as a sniper, a Probe to keep track of enemy movements, and a Laser Drone to keep the enemy occupied with its pulse laser. But now? All that's left is my Corvette and the Heavy Drone... and that isn't even mine any more. The enemy ship's Usurper system hijacked my sniper, and turned it against me.

I got lucky pulling in close to the enemy Corvette, and landing a powerful volley of pulse laser fire, forcing them to retreat for repairs. By falling back, they allowed me the opportunity to collect the data core we had both come to retrieve. Now I just have to hold out for long enough to jump out.

Unlike the enemy ship, my Corvette isn't equipped with a repair system. It WAS loaded with countermeasures, but those have all been spent keeping me alive for this long. The enemy Corvette, much like the drone he stole, is equipped to fight at longer range than me. My only chance is careful positioning in the nearby asteroid field.

After a terrifying game of cat and mouse, slipping from one rock to the next, VICTORY! Somehow, I survived...

This was the true story of a PvP match in Concealed Intent.

The game is a simultaneous turn-based tactical stealth game. The turn-based aspect gives players time to think where RTS games can't. It also allows for asynchronous ""play by mail"" style multiplayer matches. The fact that it's simultaneous means that you don't just look at what your opponent did last turn and try to counter it. You have to anticipate their next set of actions, since they'll happen at the same time as your own. The stealth mechanics allow for a lot of deception while emphasising risk/reward based gameplay.

The combination of all these mechanics produces a variety of possible approaches to every encounter. Often you'll only know the locations of the enemies. You won't know which icon is their ship, and which are drones. The more information you can gather, the better you can anticipate your opponent's next move, but to get that information, you have to risk giving away your own capabilities and plans. Finding the right balance of visibility vs. detection makes the game dynamic and ever-changing, even against AI opponents. | Played about 12 hours off-line.

A solid coffee break/lunchtime turn-based space combat fleet action game with an interesting mechanic.

The basic idea is that what you do this turn determines how much of a target you're going to be next turn.  Doing stuff (moving, using weapons and sensors, launching drones etc) raises your signature, making you easier to identify and engage.  Not doing stuff, using active countermeasures or dodging behind planets and asteroids reduces your signature making it harder.

There is a 17 mission single-player campaign which is OK but limited by the one-man dev team.  Homeworld is one of the game's inspirations and the ship art IS reminiscent of Homeworld One but don't expect the campaign to have HW-like production qualities.

The thrust of the game is its Skirmish mode which can be either single-player or multi-player and provides the player with virtually unlimited fleet selection options.

The overall look and feel of the game is good for a one-man effort.  The GUI is functional but with room for improvement, which the dev is addressing."

Just a nice simple game. | A fun game that is easy to learn yet can be quite difficult at times. Once you start playing it continues to captivate you with its thematic artwork and excellent humour. A must try for all deckbuilding fans! | A fun game held back by some limitations in gameplay, some dungeons you just don't draw the map tiles needed to accomplish the goal in a reasonable amount of time. In others you get some powerful items offered and you just run away with the game.
There is some interesting gameplay in the simple style and very simple UI helps this. I didn't have any problems learning how to play the game. (initially I did when I had never played a card game before, and came back some years later to give it another shot and found it comically easy after playing several games now)

You'll lose a few adventurers just down to bad luck, sometimes you'll just get wrecked by being forced to fight an enemy  above their level. And sometimes you (or at least I) make mistakes, it happens but those mistakes can cost your adventurers their lives, something the game makes very clear to the player and it's not even meant to be a big deal, more adventurers will sign up very quickly.

So the interesting thing about this game is the maps are basically randomly generated from a set of tiles/enemies and loot. You build the dungeon, ideally towards a specific goal (kill the boss, collect X gold things and so on), unfortunately it's not quite as fun as it sounds. You'll sometimes get some very strong enemies you have to place, other times you'll get swamped with lots of low level opponents on the map and the dungeon will feel like a chore.
There's a little bit too much rng in what map cards are offered, and no way to edit or adjust the drawing of cards for that mechanic.

The actual combat is fairly quick and once you get to grips with the game. I'll say the first level or two of your adventurers seems to be when they're most vulnerable which is problematic because this is when the players are first using them, so most folk will never find out the stronger versions of your little gang of adventurers. (the traits can be powerful)
The biggest issue for me is that hp is just a bit too important, just a single point is enough to swing the outcome of some fights. 

You get to customise them but it's very basic, some hairstyle changes, rename them and a choice of 1 male or female voice. I started to get glazed eyes after customising my 8th or 9th adventurers, at some point the random visuals don't really matter, all that really matters at least to me was being able to complete the dungeons without losing the adventurers.

The level ups for the adventurers were a little limited, I think they mostly got +1 hp and after completing a dungeon they got a trait. I would have liked a bit of a skill tree to open up, rather than yet more rng.
The only real choice the player has in character customisation is what item they get to pick when they get the option in each dungeon.

The game is okay overall, it functions well (as it should, it's pretty simple in presentation). But eventually I saw through most of the mechanics over time and became a bit disappointed in how it wasn't simple enough to just let me have a fun time (adventurers die pretty easily), or complex enough for me to feel in control (lacking higher levels of customisation in various areas). 
Yet the game is fairly hard, particularly when you're first fighting a type of enemy for the first time in various types of dungeons. Once you get how to beat them it's no big deal, but until that point it's not a fun time.
It is however quick, each run is easily 30 minutes to complete or less so it's hard to feel to upset about it.

Honestly if I could offer on a sliding scale of review somewhere in the neutral region between positive and negative I would. (when I was having fun it was close to 8/10 experience, when I wasn't it was more like 3/10.  I don't know how to boil that down into one score)
You might enjoy what's on offer if you're really curious but for the most part new games do most of what this one does better and in more advanced and/or intuitive ways. 

Ever since slay the spire came out it's hard to argue anyone buy this game over something like that. Or even darkest dungeon. Or a whole host of other card games/rpgs if you want that kind of experience.

I respect this game for trying to tie together card games and dungeon delving but it just wasn't quite there for me. Not strong enough card mechanics to engage me on an intellectual level and not strong enough story/setting to get me immersed in the world/adventurers. Too hard to let me take it lightly and too comedic for me to take it seriously.

Anyways I'd still like to thank the devs for giving it a shot and working on the game for a good while after it came out. So many other devs just abandon projects if they're not immediate successes. | Oddly fun cheeky little game.

It scratched the itch I had to play a sniping game. It's incredibly atmospheric and I found myself getting lost in the game while many hours passed in real life. There are a few different approaches to the game and I think that makes it replayable.  Being based in Africa makes a nice change from the endless number of WW2 games based in Europe that all look sort of the same. The story is also not bad.

There were a few things I didn't like. There aren't a lot of weapons but I think the DLC fixes that. The handguns are all useless except the Welrod because the others alert enemies so you might as well use a sniper rifle. I started to get a little bored towards the end after figuring out the trick to killing most enemies but it was still ok.

[b]알까기: 혁명적 우주 전투[/b] | Если в двух словах- игра великолепна.

Нет, серьезно, это шедевр. Это новый виток развития стратегий в реальном времени, которые до этого представляли из себя измененный варкрафт. Если бы не минусы (о которых позже), у игры были бы все шансы стать киберспортивной дисциплиной.Перейдем к плюсам и минусам.

Плюсы
-Геймплей.Господи, это нечто, однако очень многое зависит от микро и макро контроля., ведь правильно использованная способность одного корабля может к ебеням расколошматить целый флот. Проблема в том, что при неправильном движении это будет ВАШ флот.Более того, за игру вы вольны использовать сколько угодно тактик, а не быть привязанны к сделанным апгрейдам.Более того, в конфликсе нельзя выбыть. Если ваш флагман уничтожили, враг получит кучу победных очков, но вы сможете контролировать оставшиеся корабли, а флагман возродиться через некоторое время.
-Разнообразие. Помниться, в старкрафте геймплей за каждую из расс отличался разительно. Здесь все тоже самое, только расс не 3 а 4.Серьезно, каждая раса чуствуеться и играеться по своему, тактика ничем не ограничена, у каждой есть сильные и слабые стороны.
-Баланс. Все расы сильные. Очень. Однако, они сильны в чем-то своем, по этому ни одна из рас не ""имба"", и баланс соблюден на уровне того же Старкрафта.
-Время. Помните эти катки в варкрафт по 45-90 минут? Так вот, забудьте. Битвы в конфликс дляться 10-15 минут, однако за это время вы получите кучу наслаждения (или сожжете пару стульев, из-за того, что не учли гравитацию, и распидарасили свой флот об планету).И пускай долгосрочных стратегий здесь меньше, чем в класических RTS, это абсолютно не отражаетьс на геймплее.
-История и лор. Господи, это шедевр. Космические корабли, принадлежащие странам эпохи средневековья, летающие на курином желтке, и сражающиеся за контроль над курятниками на планетах. Одиночная компания хороша, правда требует неплохого уровня английского, для получения максимального удовольствия.
Плюсминусы
-Графика. Она не плоха, но в определенные моменты хочеться ммм, большей детализации, чтоли. В любом случае, выглядит все очень красиво , корабли легко различимы по внешнему виду, и придраться особо не к чему.
-Улучшения. Суть в том, что за выполнения стимовских ачивок, игрок навсегда увеличивает силу способностей кораблей. (сыграл 5 игр за Более Великую Британию - ультимейт флагмана наносит больше урона, уничытожил ракетами N кораблей, играя за францию- кулдаун этих ракет снижен на 5 секунд и т.д), так что, в теории старые игроки сильнее новичков не только в плане скила, но и по параметрам. Однако, на деле это не играет особой роли, и победить можно кого угодно, в независимости от количества ачивок. да и ощущать прогресс приятно :).
-Интерфейс. Он довольно хорошо настраиваеться, но сначала было не очень удобно.
А теперь то, что сгубило игру.
-Онлайн.Его нет.Почему его нет-хер знает.Но это плохо, очень.Не то чтобы одиночная компания была скучная, или с ботами играть неинтересно, но все RTS априори заточены под мультиплеер.А онлайна нет. Впрочем, исправить это можеть именно ВЫ, купив игру, а лучше подарив ее друзьям.
-Настройки лобби.Ничего серьезного, но в лобби отсутствует чат, а также возможность добавить в друзья игрока, как это реализовано, например, в доте. Также, нельзя выбирать карты, но это не особо критично.А и еще в игре только free for all для 4-ех игроков, если игроков не хватает, их заменяют боты, хотелось бы режим 2 на 2.

Подводя итог, хочеться сказать что конфликс- это незаслуженно обойденный вниманием шедевр, обязательный к покупке всем, кого не тошнит от жанра Стратегия.

9 разбитых о планеты флагманов из 10. | If your the kind of player who's willing to let some technical gripes slide for an immersive world and story this game should suck you right in, if you're reading this you've probably noticed all the negative reviews criticizing the controls. And yeah, the flick system is a little annoying and the fact you can't pause then issue commands and unpause makes the game a bit clunky, but imo it's not as bad as everyone makes it seem. Once you pick up the controls it evens out.

Now for some other opinions, as previously mentioned the story and world are interesting but the singleplayer campaings seem more like extended tutorials for the 4 nations, with a small storyline for a character for each. Not that there's anything wrong with this, but the AI feels stuck on tutorial level difficulty the whole time. Although on a related note the 4 factions I just mentioned are actually pretty well balanced. I saw another review mention this but it's true. after playing through some games with different factions, none felt too powerful or too weak and with 4 factions that's real nice | Je dis oui oui oui :-)

Type de joueur : Pas du tout un joueur de RTS à la base, dans la plupart des cas le genre m'ennuie, bon j'ai bien sûr jouer a starcraft 2 pour l'histoire et à l'époque warcraft 3 car j'aimais bien ne pas devoir gérer des centaines d'unités .

Pourtant Conflicks m'avais intrigué , j'ai beaucoup hésité et j'ai regarder pas mal de vidéo de gameplay afin de m'assurer que je souhaitait vraiment mettre 20€ dans ce jeu ( note pour moi même, fais le plus souvent couillon, ça t'évitera les jeux qui pourrissent dans ma liste car acheter sur un coup de tête )


le Jeu :

Bon je ne me lancerais pas dans l'histoire, la vidéo de page de magasin l'explique bien, et c'est du bon délire , n'esperez pas non plus trouver des vannes sur les poulets .

Conflicks est a un stade bien avancé pour un early access , campagne solo , multijoueurs ( attention pour le moment n'est disponible que du 1vs1vs1vs1 ou 2vs2 humain ou ia , aussi le seul mode multi disponible pour le moment est à base de point , réglable pour augmenter ou diminuer le temps de la partie) .

la pitchnette c'est la vie, et ça reste le gros attraits du jeu , ça change complétement le management et les déplacement des Rts basique .

La pichnette se joue trés bien à la souris , bref vous selectionner votre unité , en restant appuyé vous tirer vers l'arrière et propulser votre vaisseau .

bien qu'il soi plutôt simple de gérer la distance en situation tranquille, cela devient vite retord dans les situations d'emballement , il faudra faire vite et bien en espérant ne pas envoyer son petit joujou dans l'atraction d'une planête , dans un astéroîde , dans les nuages corrosifs , dans les lunes qui joue le rôle de bumper imprévisible .

bien que la distance reste encore facile à maitriser, ça se corse au niveau de la direction a moyenne et longue distance .

les factions: le jeu propose 4 factions , bien que les vaisseaux soi les mêmes avec un désign différent , leurs pouvoirs est complétement différents ( exemple : la Corvette : d'un coté elle peut activer un bouclier qui réflète les tirs ennemis sur lui même, alors que de l'autre coté elle charme l'ennemi en leurs rentrant dedans ect... ) 

le jeu demande donc beaucoup de micromanagement , bien que 2 unités se trouvant a porter entame leurs tirs de lasers , les pouvoirs spéciaux de chaques unités doivent être activé manuellement, ou par pichnette ( missiles ect...) tout ceci rend le jeu ultra dynamique , savoir viser, savoir profiter de son environement ect .... 

renseignez vous  , regarder un peu de gameplay .car il est difficile de tout expliquer sans tomber dans un roman qui ne seras lu par personne :-) en bref, conquérir des planêtes afin d'engranger et augmenter sa réserve de metamatière ( chaque déplacement , pouvoirs coûte de cette matière .....

 pour ma part je suis conquis par cette découverte | A funny and yet compelling game base on the simple concept of flinking your ships to position rather just point and clicking your way towards the destination.

The art style and humor of this game keeps is separated from the competition while the flicking mechanic makes it intriquing and compelling enough.
Even though the campain can be challenging [God damn it Antonio!!!!] it dose a good job at introducing the players to the faction mechanics before dropping litterraly all that you have just learned towards the end.
The gameplay by design is more focused on the micro management since you simply can not flick more then one ship at the time unless you use a Frigate, and even that is not exacly macro gameplay, you just attach your ships to one and shoot them into space in hope a vessel dosen't bump into a rando asteroid and blocks your entire ball.

Even though the ships by them self have the same base stats, it's the skills that each one posses that can change the flow of the battle. For exemple I found that if the AI leaves the mothership alone for a good amount of time, taking a Greater Britan corvette with the shield on can cause as much damage as a well dispached torped, just distract them long enough for the bigger guns to move in.
The physics are just the ice on the cake and good players will be able to make the best of it while also efficently using all the skills in your arsenal and constantly pouring out new ships to send to the frontline.

Moving each ship can be, however, frustating or stressing simply because you have to aim each and every one of them in order to not screw your self by bumping your own troops into their doom.

Not much to say on the options since it's a 2D game with a cartoon art style the only effective change to the quality is the screen resolution.

Overall it's a fun game that I'd wish I could try in a deathmatch PvP game but right now the community seems too small as the game has passed under the Steam radar. Here one hopes it's actual relase date brings some much needed attention. Sad to say some skills or factions might end up not fully balanced because of the lack of PvP players to test it."

Seriously, this game is fun. | Very fun game, but the difficulty is busted and ridiculous.

I'm pretty sure the sponsor you select for a race change the ""difficulty"" of that race (whenever I choose the lowest paying sponsor, like a 10th position or higher, my cars always get P5 minimum; when i choose a higher paying sponsor, like 5th and 2nd position or higher, my cars will unexplainebly get passed by other cars- specially at the end of the race).

I got pretty good with my own team on the 3rd year: I could easily get P2s and P1s - but the game just forces you to struggle with money by messing with your races whenever you choose a better paying sponsor.

Не рекомендую цей піс оф щіт | It is exactly what it seems like. An X-com style isometric shooter set in the wild west, mixed with urban fantasy elements. It doesn't try to be anything more, or anything less.

The biggest distinction is it's luck mechanic and heavier narrative focus. What it means is that the chances of you shooting someone or getting shot are a lot more easier to predict and wager, while your engagements are a lot more scripted, less randomized. Also, the posse you get are nearly all scripted, so the game is balanced around that as well. It all makes the game feel a lot more fair, but it also makes it way easier to master and complete than regular x-com, so it may not be appealing to the really hardcore players. But for me it was just right. | I would not recommend this game for people who are looking for a thoughtful, Western X-Com game. Hard West is a mixture of table top game and X-Com like fights but there is something off and janky about the game. I have tried multiple times to beat the Retired Demon, about 2 hours of time tonight and the limitations of the came comes front and center.

The game doesn't allow you to have a manual save or even multiple save states so if you go into a battle scenario under prepared you will lose and lose repeatedly. I cannot heal other team mates, and there is a lack of in mission options for recovering health unless you equip multiple before battles. I also have realized that some of the Playing Card abilities are very finicky, like the eating the dead one that I had equipped on my crazy moonshiner which would only randomly work at times. I would be standing on a tile with a dead enemy and I could not eat the flesh and even after swapping around which tile I was on.

The GUI and interface, the controls are exactly like X-Com and similar game but there was even 3 to 4 hours in an apprehension about ""If I Right click vs Left click is it going to back out on what I was going to do?""

I love the weird West genre, and I love most Westerns too, but this game just left me frustrated. When I tried to back out of the section I was in to see if I could go back a few turns on the table top portion it straight  up just restarted all my progress in that chapter.

I just wish that there was more forethought put into certain aspects of the game play mechanics and the way the game flows. But I will say if you want a crazy tough experience, even with the jankiness, give the game a shot. For people who want a game that doesn't have the extreme jank that I experienced, look elsewhere for your Weird West X-Com."
76561198032898393,418240,Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun,1.2833333333333334,"Indie, Strategy",0,"Great strategy stealth game with cute graphics. Feudal Japan settings fits the game like charm and I would not believe that this kind of game will work so flawlessly with controller, so much, that I would not think of going back to m+k. Pity that Mimimi studio, which stands behind the game, closed the offices. | It’s rare to find a game that excels in the pillars of mechanics, storytelling, and art as consistently as Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun. It has its share of blemishes, most prominent of which being camera controls that made me want to flip an entire hibachi table. But its needle-sharp stealth systems, cast of memorable characters with diverse abilities and personalities, and an uncommonly grounded saga set in a stylized feudal Japan left me with a sense of true accomplishment and a role in a well-told story.

Each of Shadow Tactics’ five characters has a particular set of skills that make them suited to different sneaky deeds, like hunkering down in bushes, isolating and executing enemies, and hiding the evidence before anyone notices. There were clearly times that called for Mugen, a samurai who can take out a cluster of enemies in a katana flurry, and times when it was a job for Yuki, a young thief who can lure solo enemies into traps. Other times, using them both in tandem allowed me to achieve what neither could alone, which created some great “Eureka!” moments. |

76561198032898393,378120,Unknown,30.65,,8,"Наверное, у всех есть предел, когда можно игнорировать какие-то вещи. Например, матерную надпись на стене в подъезде, дверь в шкафчике, которая не закрывается, боль в спине и т.д. Как бы оно всё и так сойдет, но рано или поздно терпению приходит конец. Football Manager 2016 – это мой предел. Именно после 2016 менеджера, я понял, что не могу больше терпеть эту халтуру. Каждая новая версия игры стоит 25$, а для ЕС и США все 50$. Что же за это получаем? Да ни хрена! Обновление составов и мелкие изменения, которые без списка этих самых изменений и не заметишь. Где новый движок 3-д матча? Где лечение бесконечных крэшов? Где полномасштабные изменения скиллов у игроков? Где, в конце концов, фотографии и логотипы (а да, зачем, их же фанаты делают)? Где расширенная система взаимодействия с игроками и между игроками (кстати, даже в Fifa Manager были интересные наработки в этом направлении)? Где возможность создавать юношеские академии? Где новые вопросы в пресс-конференции? Список претензий к разработчикам можно продолжать и продолжать. Если кто-то думает, что Football Manager за свою многолетнюю историю стал идеальным, то он глубоко ошибается. Возможность создать свой клуб, редактор тренерской рожи, косметические изменения в интерфейсе, новые движения для буратин в 3-д матча – это не то, что нужно. С другой стороны, а что стоит ожидать – конкурентов же нет. Смысл развиваться дальше? Каждый год новая версия менеджера уверенно держится в лидерах продаж. В этом году она, например, три недели была на втором месте после Fallout 4. Кроме того, на момент написания обзора в игре находится 70 тысяч человек, в том же Fallout 4 всего на 10 тысяч больше. Поэтому, я уверен, у Sports Interactive всё хорошо, а то, что игра топчется на месте – это пустяки. Фанаты менеджера настолько олдскульные ребята, что им же кроме колобков в 2-д матче и новых составов ничего не надо. Короче, не зря я целых два месяца не хотел покупать Football Manager 2016 и зря всё-таки купил. | [h1] Football Manager 2016 Beta First Impressions [/h1]

[b]Hey guys, I'm about to write my first impressions about the game, but keep in mind that this is beta / pre-order version. Also, this review is intended for Football Manager players that already know how to play this game.[/b]

Pros: 


[list]
    [*] Most advanced animations yet in any Football Manager edition. What I mean by that is the fact that FINALLY you can see the difference in Flair / Quality between 2 players. New dribblings, crosses, decisions and finishing in front of goal. It was FM13 since I've been asking for more realistic dribblings / decisions / crosses in the final third but the game never got quite there, until now. Let me give you a short example: I am playing as AC Milan and Jeremy Menez was attacking the right flank as a Winger-Attack. In any of the previous versions, he would have done 3 possible things: attack the byline and cross, cutting into the penalty area or pass the ball back to the overlappting full back. Now, I noticed something absolutly beautiful: He did neither of those. His decision was to dribble 2 players like they were nothing by cutting inside the penalty area and then he launched a lobbed-cross to Luiz Adriano who was rushing forward from a deeper position. Now, besides his way of dribbling (which i've never seen before in FM), we can easily notice another MAGNIFICENT improvement: lobbed crosses. This kind of crosses are a must in a game like FM and I am finally happy it was introduced. So yes, new animations / decisions / dribblings / crossings. You can finally see the difference between 15 Flair and 18 Flair so to speak.
    [*] Game is in a much better state beta wise than it was last year (loading times, match engine and leagues)
    [*] Fast loading / saving times. Last year's beta was awful regarding saving times. It was something that eventually got fixed, but FM16 doesn't have this problem at all. In fact, to me it seems than the game loads/saves faster than FM15.
    [*] 3D Match Engine is another thing that pleasantly surprised me (played 3 games). By this I mean it feels smoother, no visible glitches and artefacts. Last year we had all sorts of problems with 3d engine performance until it got fixed (the game ran choppy and stuttering a lot on anything above ""medium"" quality no matter how powerful your machine was). In this regard, FM 2016 shines right from the start. I am able to play the game on highest graphical settings.
    [*] One of the biggest improvements in my opinion is ProZone analysis tool. This tool is so so much better than what we had before. If you are the kind of manager that likes to keep tabs on every aspect of the tactic you are creating, than I swear, ProZone is exactly what you've been waiting for. 
    [*] New tactical framework is excelent  in my opinion, definetly much better than last year's, especially if you are a newcomer to the game. For new players it is much easier to make them understand what each setting does and for the experienced players, well, it makes their ""job"" easier.
    [*] Another pro of FM 16 is the actual Player Profile Screen which wasn't completly revamped but the slight adjustments SI made are welcome. You can get almost every necessary info about a player just by clicking Profile Tab.
    [*] Contract negociations screen has been completly revamped and its new look is very neat. It wasnt bad in any of the previous versios, but these new adjustments are always welcome.
[/list] 

Cons:

[list]
    [*] The only con that I feel I must put out is how the Formation Tactic screen looks like. By this, I mean the players on the pitch in the tactics screen. I feel that player's ""thumbnail"" takes way way too much space than it needs to. This gives me some sort of claustrophobic feeling. This is something that bothers me, but it might not bother anybody else.
[/list]

Now, I didn't write about all the new features that SI has introduced because that's not relevant for this review. I felt like I only need to adress things that need to be adressed considering the game is still in BETA state. This said, I conclude this review by stating that FM16 BETA seems far better than FM15 BETA and I will enjoy every minute of it. I will write a full review after the game comes out in the final version (13 November). By then I will know more. Consider this review, as a review at a glance if you will. Enjoy the best football manager simulator out there.

I also recorded some videos of it, which you can see on my profile/YT channel. | Sigo a seguinte premissa: Não leia Críticas (especializadas ou não), faça a sua própria análise ao jogar. Com tal pensamento, eis que me deparo com mais uma situação incongruente, ou seja, diversas análises negativas (de uma geração ""leite com pêra"" (que sequer jogou o famoso CM)).

Pois bem, FM 2016 está INCRÍVEL! Além de ter corrigido os erros existentes em Football Manager 2015, conseguiu trazer um jogo EXTREMAMENTE leve e fluido. O motor de jogo está sublime. Adiante, quem reclama de ""lesões"" ou ""dificuldade"" é porque, simplesmente, não sabe arrumar o ""staff"", bem como definir um padrão de jogo. Por sinal, não é por acaso que grandes Ligas de Futebol mundo afora têm utilizado a base de dados de Football Manager.. Puts, o jogo está MUITO realista. Muito mesmo! Para quem é fã de futebol, encontrará em FM 2016 um VERDADEIRO simulador onde o ""gerenciar um time"" nunca esteve tão real. Aqui, o manager (você jogador) deve analisar, além de questões técnicas e táticas, a saúde financeira de seu time (buscando sempre equilibrá-lo financeiramente). 

Enfim.. Jogão! Jogão! Jogão! | I would like to preface this by saying a few things: First, I've been playing FM games for about 10 years now, so while I don't have as much experience as others, I'd still say I'm quite familiar with the game.

Secondly, upon reading many of the reviews here (mostly the negative ones), I have to say - a game being ""too hard"" isn't a valid reason to give a negative review; it just means you either don't understand the game, or you're just plain bad at it.

Alright, onto the review. As I've said, I've played this franchise for quite a while now, with thousands of hours pumped into it, and I must say that this is probably the most balanced of them all. I say that for a couple of reasons. First, I don't run away with games against teams I have no business beating. It sounds like a lot of people on here will take a team like Aston Villa and expect to be world beaters, lose to Man Utd, and say ""the game's cheating, I lost."" Look at the real life table and you'll see something shocking! Villa are dead last. You're not meant to win every game all the time. I'm sorry, but you're not - if you did, the game would be broken. 

I find it funny that people come into sim games and expected it to be realistic, but only if you're winning, like you're the best manager in the world. If a real life, qualified, and experienced manager can't get wins, or stay afloat in the top flight, what kind of gall do you have to think you're better than somebody who does it for a living? It's a bit arrogant.

Yes, I understand it's a video game, and that you, as the player, have a hero complex. You've played Mario, you're a fat Italian plumber who's doing acrobatics and crap, killing monsters. Then you play FM and bring that mentality to a sim game, and get pissy when you're garbage. Well, Mario isn't a realistic game is it? We all know Italians can't do anything, let alone save a princess over and over again. ;)

Jokes aside, the positives of this game vastly outweigh the negatives. Another positive to the match engine is the realism in the highlights and game play. In the past I've noticed that in the final 10 minutes or so, teams would dominate you. This was incredibly present in FM15. It didn't seem to matter who the teams were - Spain vs. Malta, didn't matter, Malta would destroy the final ten with nearly 100% possession. Sure, it could be written off as tactics, and player fatigue, and all that, but it was too consistent to be a fluke. This version has none of that. Evenly matched teams seems to have equal spells of possession through the game, which is good. 

There are still some issues with possession mind you. I have found that in the majority of my matches, even against superior teams, I'm dominating the possession and shot game. In fact, it can be a bit ridiculous at times with me having upwards of 75% control over the game. I suppose it's a good problem to have.

Let's take a look at scorelines. Again, in past installments, scores could reach outrageous numbers on a consistent basis. I can't tell you how many times I was apart of 5-3 games. Sure, it happens. But not 15-20 times a season. FM 16 provides more realistic scores, despite the odd possession bias. Most of my games are 1-0, 2-1, etc... I had one 4-0 game. There really isn't much more to say on this other than it seems like it's more realistic.

Defending - oh boy, this has been a personal problem of mine for years in this game. I just don't have the tactical know-how to keep the ball out of my own net, and I like many, ticked it up to a poor ME. This year's version I'm quite pleased with. Either I figured out the defending myself, or the game changed to allow more realistic scorelines. I don't mind losing - it's part of football. But I HATE losing 5-0. It was a turn off for me, and often times I would just quit and not play for a few days because of that. Like I said, save for one game where we scored 4, I haven't seen obnoxious scorelines for seemingly no reason. It's good, I like it.

""But, we've dominated the game, have 30 shots, and lost 1-0. The game is broken."" - Many negative reviews. I suppose these people have never heard of defending/counter attacking. Absolutely that can happen. Look at Chelsea's Champions League win a few years back. They sat in their own end the entire game, and scraped out a win. It's not pretty, but when you're up against a stronger team, it's what you have to do. I feel the AI in this game is better than it has been in years past. Opposition knows when they're up against a stronger team, and they pretty much line up 10 guys at the edge of the box, forcing you to have control and possession, taking bad shots, and frustrating your strikers. All the while, they're sucking your defenders in. Fullbacks get too deep, to try for the wide ball, and central defenders slowly creep forward losing the only striker up front. Next thing ya know, they have a 1-on-1, and you're down 1. You get pissed off and say it's broken. I say, change your tactic. Draw the defense out, so press so much. Etc...

Football is a complex game, and FM 16 is just as complex. If you don't want realistic football, if you want to go and rout your opponents at every turn, play FIFA. Managing a team in a realistic setting is frustrating, but it also has it's rewards. And in this version, I feel that SI has finally nailed down a realistic, fun, and interesting experience. 

There are other aspects I haven't touched upon, like the transfers, UI, and press conferences. But other than the new design, it's all pretty much the same old. The new skin looks alright, takes a bit getting used to, but ya know, you can just get a mod. :) | Грустно конечно это все. Как человеку любящему футбол и играющему еще со времен Championship Manager на сегодняшний ФМ смотреть без содрогания невозможно. В 09 году когда свет увидел первый 3Д, проект казался прорывом. На баги, косяки, несоответствия мной лично закрывались глаза т.к. казалось что ФМ стоит на пороге большего будущего и из года в год будет развиваться и совершенствоваться. Прошел год, еще один, еще....Разработчики мужественно возились с графической частью. ""Колобки"" стали более человекоподобны. Менюшки информативнее, а управление в целом пошло по пути упрощения. Сейчас уже и не вспомнить когда тактическая часть перестала развиваться а когда уже начала деградировать. Реально работавшие командные и индивидуальные тонкие настройки были заменены на более понятные и более примитивные. Относительную сложность и настраиваемость проекта принесли в жертву его популяризации. Как показало время еще хуже дело обстоит с морально устаревшим движком. Если качество картинки с каждым годом постепенно улучшается то содержание того что происходит на экране по сути не меняется уже без малого десяток лет. Не меняется само собой в лучшую сторону.
Нету смысла перечислять все моменты которые выводят из себя игроков, люди долго играющие их все знают, но тот факт что поделать с ними долгие годы ничего не могут говорит о том, что это движок себя полностью исчерпал и ничего стоящего из него уже не выдавить. В 17-ом можно будет порезать навесы вокруг которых строится вся игра ФМ16. Можно будет например ""апнуть"" дриблинг или немного подкрутить игру защитников но сути дела это уже не меняет. Проект не просто перестал развиваться. Он деградирует.
Не так давно пробежался по тематическим форумам с любопытством просматривая какими же игровыми схемами пользуются люди в ФМ 16. Сразу бросился в глаза крайне ограниченный выбор расстановок и еще более урезанный игровых ролей на поле. Фланговые атакующие защитники, инсайды, ложные девятки, форварды отходящие в оборону наше все. Наше безальтернативное все если хотите не просто играть а выигрывать. Еще в 14-ом я совершенно спокойно брал любую команду, и ставил ей ту игру которую от нее хотел видеть. ""Колобки"" на поле благодаря тонкой настройке делали то что я хотел. Не без ошибок, кривизны, багов и пр. но все же можно было поставить игру любой команде и вопрос стоял лишь в количестве времени убитого на эту команду для достижения нужного результата. Сравнивать с ""миром навесов"" от ФМ 16 даже желания никакого не возникает.
п.с. Ну и последним гвоздем в крышку гроба стала тактика которую выложил какой то скучающий от всего этого бездумия товарищ. Как вам господа футбольные гуру расстановочка 2-1-4-3 ? Нет я не ошибся именно так...два центральных защитника, один опорный хав, четыре атакующих хава и три форварда. Какое отношение это имеет к футболу? На мой субъективный никакого а вот человек этой расстановкой совершенно спокойно аутсайдером Серии А берет чемпионат забивая за сезон около 200(!) мячей. Какие еще нужны доказательства несостоятельности этого ""антифутбольного забагованного движка"". 
Ну и в итоге хочется пожалеть об отсутствии кокуренции. Все таки в это болото нужно кидать камни иначе его совсем затянет тиной.

Всем удачи."

One of my favorite games. I would give 10/10 | After my 3rd attempt, I was able to beat this game, and I didn't really like it. The game is cruel, unreasonably hard and very disrespectful to player. 
At first, the game bombards you with a ton of non-skippable events, missions, messages. While you trying to figure out what's going on, they put on a timer on you with this ""Project Avatar"" thing, and you immediately feel a lot of pressure. Some missions are just crazy difficult, like those for Serpent King and Mad AI factory, and you don't expect this difficulty this early in the game.
Mid-game you finally have a chance to catch some breath and start working on some research, building and engineering, but here's the catch: the moment you get better in the game, the moment you upgrade your weapons and armour, the enemies suddenly become more powerful and armoured. You just don't have a chance to enjoy powerful things that you've made, because they quickly become just what is expected by default.
The end game comes unexpectedly, with a lot of pressure on you. It consists of two consecutive missions with no pause in between. If you got some units damaged in the first mission, you either will have to replace your best units or send them in wounded. The final mission is crazy, the amount of extremely powerful enemies is over the top, and it carries a lot of stress.
Given that the game is flawed with bugs in controls, has dumb battle mechanics that lead to absurd situations and very challenging overall even on lower difficulties, I would not recommend this game. | XCOM2の面白さを語るには、前作にして名作 XCOM: Enemy Unknown (以下XCOM:EU) と比較すると分かりやすいと思う

まず前作のXCOM:EUからあらゆる面で順当に進化しておりボリュームも増した
Steamワークショップ対応でMODも充実と欠点なし！と、損は無いのでセール時にはぜひ買ってプレイしてほしい

以上を大前提とした上で、そう⋯700時間以上もプレイ（最高難易度を最小部隊人数でクリア済）した上で私個人の見解を言わせてもらうと
XCOM:EUよりもゲーム性（ゲームとしての楽しさの意）は落ちてしまったと感じる
XCOM:EUはXCOM2よりも飽きの来る要素が多いはずなのに⋯だ！
※EUでは敵の配置が一部完全固定だったり⋯etc

繰り返し遊ぶゲームとしてみるとXCOM2の方が優秀なはずである
ではなぜ私はXCOM:EUの方がゲーム性が高いと言えるのか？
XCOM:EUのゲーム性はまるでパワプロなのだ
パワプロもメインイベントは決まった日に起こるはずなのに、何度もプレイしても楽しい

XCOM:EUではストーリーの進行と、ミッションが適切な間隔で詰まっており
兵士の計画的な育成（＝ビルドを組む楽しさ）と、時間制限（＝敵の更新／強化）
のバランスがすごい良かったのだ
そしてランダム性が少ないことが→上手くなれば、あらゆる要素を縛っても戦術で勝てる
など良い方向に働いたりした

一方でXCOM2では、多くの追加要素により楽しさも増したが、
その分ストーリーとミッションの関連性が薄れ、またタイムリミット枠の選ばれし者たちの介入は、
戦闘を長引かせる良くない要素の一つだと思う
選ばれし者自体はすごく面白いのだが、3人は多い！ゲームのかさ増しになってしまってる

ストーリーとレジスタンスの尻拭いを交互にやらされるのも間延びする原因だ
XCOM:EUでは助ける国と、見捨てる国の切り分けも緊張感を煽る良いスパイスだった
XCOM:EUでの上手くなるは「ゲームオーバーにならなければ見捨てて/切り捨ててOK」だった
XCOM2では上手くなると「滅亡カウンターがやばくなってきたから、そろそろ助けに行くか～」と、どの難易度でもなった
侵略されてXCOM:EUより悲惨なはずなのに、なんか緊張感にかけるのである
追加要素をプレイさせるために、滅亡までの時間にどうしても猶予が出来てしまったためだ
この点がゲーム性がXCOM:EUより落ちてしまったと感じる部分だ

難易度が上がると、どんどん無駄を減らすプレイングが重要で、駆け抜けるようなゲームプレイ感になるXCOM:EUと
研究や勢力や選ばれし者など、たくさんの要素からどっしり構えて戦略を練っていくXCOM2とプレイ感が違う
そしてたまたまXCOM:EUの方が私に合っていただけなのかも知れない

色々言ったがXCOM2のMODでの拡張性と、それに伴う豊富なキャラクリは本当に最高なので

76561198032898393,427820,Hitman GO: Definitive Edition,1.0833333333333333,Strategy,2,"В свое время я пропустил данную игру, так как не любил стелс игры (это же Hitman подумал я), да и доверия к мобильному геймингу в 2014 было не очень много (первоначально игра вышла на iOS).

И данная неприятная ассоциация как то засела у меня в голове, без обновления информации, вплоть до 2024 года, когда на очередной распродаже мне удалось выхватить эту игру почти даром.

И на этот раз мое мнение изменилось. Игра представляет из себя имитацию настольной пошаговой игры, в которой нам надо достичь целей уровня. Каждый наш шаг будет активировать действия противников, которые мы заранее можем предугадать. Играется это как вариация “Камисадо” (ну у меня была такая внутренняя ассоциация).

В игре есть 7 целей, которые микшируются в зависимости от уровня.
[olist]
    [*]Дойти до точки эвакуации
    [*]Убить главную цель
    [*]Захватить кейс с данными
    [*]Убить всех на уровне
    [*]Никого не убивать на уровне
    [*]Сделать не более N шагов
    [*]Не убивать собак
[/olist]

Причем, 1 и 2 цель всегда завершают уровень и не могут быть на одном уровне одновременно.

Также в игре есть 3 типа врагов (охранник, бегун, снайпер). На самом деле их больше, но они очень схожи по своим паттернам. 

По итогу комбинация целей, врагов и маршрутов дают нам головоломку для решения уровня. К сожалению, иногда последовательность решения может существовать только одна, что для головоломки - не очень хороший показатель.

Игра вываливает на тебя чуть больше сотни уровней, которые прячутся за 8 коробками (этапами), где каждый этап дает новые механики.

Игра идеальна для Steam Deck, я играл в нее перед сном по 30 минут, за это время можно смело пройти 1 этап. И пусть вас не смущает отсутствие английского языка, тут из английского слов 30 на всю игру))))

Так же, не могу не отметить относительную легкость достижений. Поскольку игра пошаговая, сложных достижений нет (если гуглить). Но есть неинтересные - это фарм убийств, прохождение всех уровней на 3 звезды и нельзя использовать подсказки, иначе запорите достижение и придется начинать все заново.

По итогу, как игру для дека могу рекомендовать, проходится за пару вечеров, выглядит атмосферно и играется неплохо.

P.S. Если вы как я, решили что есть настольная игра (по мотивам которой и сделали Hitman GO), то увы это не так, просто игра сделана как настолка. И на моей памяти это впервые, обычно настолки переносят в цифру, а тут сделали настолку в цифре без настолки. 
 | It is a fine game, but has a few major flaws; the first being broken achievements. In my 7 hours of
playtime, I could only get 6 achievements, and the rest simply refused to unlock. This makes hundred
percenting the game irrelevant.
My other complaint comes from how the objective system works. Hundred percenting a level requires
you to do two optional objectives. The problem is that the level design only allows you to complete one
at a time, forcing you to play the same level twice, only in a slightly different manner. This made the
game infinitely more boring for me, so much so that I stopped perfecting it altogether, making my
experience much more enjoyable. Incentivising replayability can work for a mainline Hitman game,
where tonnes of content is available to explore, keeping each replay fresh and interesting. But, forcing
players to replay levels from a board game which is already so linear, was a step in the wrong direction.
I think the worst type of objectives were ""complete the game in x turn or less"". They turned the
experience into a slog. In addition to this, the game does not even show how many turn you have made
in a level, making these challenges even more annoying. Providing this information would have turned
them much more tolerable.
The missions where you could complete all the objectives in one go were actually fun, and the entire
game should have been like this. Coincidentally, these levels also did not contain that aforementioned
""x turns or less"" challenge. Another minor criticism I have is that you have to manually check the
objectives in a level by going to the menu. I would have preferred if they were directly displayed on the
screen, or at the beginning of each level.
I know that the I sound extremely negative in my review. But, most of my problems are only relevant if
you are looking forward to hundred percenting the game. If you do not care about that, it just ""clicks"",
especially its sound effects. They add so much to the experience, and it would have been a somewhat of
an inferior product if not for them. Every action is punctuated with so much weight, that you can
almost forget for a moment that you are not actually killing people. The music too, while used
sparingly, fits the tone of the experience. | Bueno, complejo, menos de 10h de gameplay, lamentablemente no tiene un buen soundtrack y carece de sonidos, en pocas palabras, es como jugar ajedrez con skins. | Não procure as respostas no google.

1) First is obviosuly the merit to the game itself. It is really enjoyable, unique and probably one of the best indie games i have come across. Once you start a playthrough, you just immerse yourself in the character, the beautiful settings and the writing it offers. The music is lovely, so the deluxe edition is reccommended.

Gameplay wise, having to weigh in the pros and cons of actions as well as taking into account of the limited time and resources available to the character in the playthrough is the strongest element of the game. Basically, you have to make smart choices to score high but at the same time you also get to choose the high road or the low road in making decisions and that will put your own morality to the test, which I really like to see in all kinds of games. 

I did 3 playthroughs so far, and the 3 playthroughs were completely different to each other even though the main quest line does not change. This is because you practically can't do all, which again makes you choose smart and makes the game replayable which is I believe is value for money. 

2) The developers are really responsive to community feedback and constantly with all ears on how to improve the game by taking into account of our experiences.

Best example is, when I encountered that reading books (character can buy books) in the game does not have excerpts from the actual book itself, I pointed that out as a weakness to the devs. They responded immediatly and said that they will add this feature to the next update in May, and i'm really ecstatic about it. 
Then I as well as a lot of people playing the game has complained about the shortness of the playthrough, and they addressed that also. So, it's really good to see the devs listening to us, the community. 

So yes, I reccommend this game with full thumbs up! 
 | Kim is a top down adventure game where you play as the boy Kim. Kim was orphaned at a young age and lives the life of a vagabond doing tasks for money. In this game, the player travels around 1800s india during the ""Great game"". You have to manage your money, happiness and health (Including sickness and hunger). The player has the choice to work for the money (at the cost of time) or steal (at the cost of merit). When Kim turns 18 years of age the game ends and the score is tallyed based on your actions. The game loosely follows the story of the original book by Rudyard Kipling but gives the player the freedom to explore and discover the secrets of 1800s india. With detailed dialogues, descriptions and a very pretty, drawn graphic style, KIM is a very enjoyable game based on exploration. It challenges the player with little money and little food to survive on as a vegabond boy. Although it can feel like the game is rushing you at times, it has plenty of replay value with random seeds for the game world and the oppertunity to make different choices or discover something that you never expected to... | Описать эту игру какой-то одной емкой фразой лично мне сложно: в Kim тебя одновременно встречают и элементы RPG, и сюрвайвл в (относительно) открытом мире, и достаточно ""рогаликовый"" подход к истории (так называемый emergent narrative). Эдакий Sunless Sea, но без кораблей и Лавкрафта, а про Индию. Возможно, именно поэтому игра настолько незаслуженно малоизвестна: за два года - 25 обзоров, из них на русском - всего один. За разработчиков просто по-человечески обидно, потому что Kim – игра, сделанная с любовью и душой, и это сразу заметно. 

Самая уникальная часть Kim - это её сеттинг, и если вы любите историю, это гарантировано подкупит с самого начала. Игра основана на одноименном романе Редьярда Киплинга: действие разворачивается в колониальной Индии 1880-х, главный герой – 14-летний сирота и бродяжка Ким, сын британского солдата, оказавшийся на улице после смерти родителей. Завязка почти полностью идентична книге: вместе с престарелым тибетским ламой вам предстоит отправиться на поиски священной для буддистов Реки Стрелы и заодно принять участие во множестве сопутствующих приключений. А вот как история будет разворачиваться дальше, зависит уже не от Киплинга, а исключительно от ваших выборов: Kim сразу предоставляет вам полную свободу действий. До совершеннолетия еще четыре года, и главная цель игры – обрасти как можно большим количеством заслуг (“Merit”) за это время.

Перед вами откроется вся Северная Индия. Можно начать путешествие на восток, в сторону Гималаев или Дели - а можно пойти на север, исследовать Кашмир и предгорья Афганистана, а затем развернуться, и на железной дороге отправиться куда-то в Умбаллу, Лакнау или Аллахабад. Везде вам будут встречаться самые разные люди: ремесленники и торговцы, богачи и попрошайки, джайны и сикхи, мусульмане и британцы. Многие из них с радостью расскажут о своей жизни и обычаях. В целом, геймплей довольно ненавязчивый, но и непростой: придётся следить за голодом, усталостью и уровнем здоровья, выпрашивать еду для себя и ламы, убегать от разбойников, узнавать слухи и мудро распоряжаться скудными заработками – рупии Киму по крайней мере в начале игры перепадают очень нечасто. 

Атмосфера колониальной Индии передана отлично: посещение любого крупного города или достопримечательности сопровождается соответствующей исторической справкой и фотографиями из источников тех времён. В игре много возможностей и сюжетных поворотов из оригинальной книги: например, по ходу странствий Ким может повстречать военную часть своего отца, попасть в католическую школу и принять участие в борьбе британской и русской разведок. В целом, Kim – это отличное приключение, которое принесёт двойное удовольствие тем, кто читал первоисточник. 

Единственное «но» - если с английским вы не в ладах, поиграть комфортно вряд ли получится: ни официальной локализации, ни фанатского перевода у игры нет, а она достаточно сильно завязана на тексте (причем довольно непростом, так как большая его часть либо напрямую цитирует Киплинга, либо плотно использует местные диалекты, английский XIX века и своеобразную индийскую манеру на нём разговаривать). Если же это вас не останавливает – вперёд, сейчас у игры большая скидка, а таких разработчиков однозначно стоит поддержать. | In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#24 out of 500+)... it's time for KIM.

Kim is an interesting little roguelike that I really wish I could recommend, if only for the uniqueness of the setting. Sadly, it is somewhat hamered by two major flaws. The first is somewhat superficial--the player character, Kim, isn't differentiated in any meaningful way from any of the NPCs, which makes it very difficult to tell where, exactly, you are on the map. And second, the ""writing"" is really and truly bad. Much is, bafflingly, literal nonsense.  The most challenging aspect of the game is simply deciphering what, exactly, the text is meant to convey.

Here's an example line of dialog more or less indicative of what to expect from the game proper:

""I have known many men in my so long life, and disciples not a few. But to none among men, if so be you are woman-born, has my heart gone out as it has to you - thoughtful, wise and courteous: but something of a small imp.""

This arhaic prose might be familiar to you--Kim, the game, is an adaptation of a Rudyard Kipling novel of the same name. This line, like all of the other text in the game, is lifted directly from the Kipling novel--with extra bits grafted on from -other- novels and short stories. If that sounds like a horrendously bad idea... it is. See, here's the thing... Kim is (crucially) not a novel. It's a game. Specifically, an RPG. If you're expecting the dialog options to make any sense... don't. If you're expecting one sentence to follow logically from the preceding sentence and flow naturally into the succeeding sentence... don't. The thing about RPGs is that they don't tell linear stories like novels, or even other games. You walk around, talk to people--ask them specific questions, etc., etc. All of which requires that the output text from NPCs matches, in some way, the input text from the player. If you ask a character, ""Where is the bakery?"". you would expect them to say something about the Bakery, right? Or perhaps comment on your ignorance. But in Kim, to torture the analogy, they'd wax poetic instead on how they spent their youth in the countryside. EG what you say to an NPC has very little relevance in what they say to you. At best, you'll get a quote ripped out of some Kipling story that is vaguely, peripherally relevant. At best.

And, of course, because this problem also persists in-between individual lines. Cutting-and-pasting someone else's sentences together is not an effective way to craft coherent dialog.

Kim is... an ambitious game. But ultimately it fails, grandly, to live up to those ambitions. Perhaps they might have had more luck ripping text from a different author with more generic, and therefore more malleable prose... but as the example quote I mentioned earlier demonstrates, Kipling's prose is... dense. The two most important things in RPG writing are clarity and coherence. Kim, unfortunately, provides neither.

I really wanted to like Kim. I'm fond of rogue-likes and I love the idea of games that play historical settings straight--especially settings that, in Western media, are underused--unfortunately Kim, though an excellent idea for a game, completely botches the execution. This game could have been something really special if they'd simply hired a writer to craft the narrative in the *style* of Kipling, rather than simply chuck a bunch of old novels into a blender and glue the resulting mess back together. | 这是一款生存游戏，但我更喜欢叫它印度步行模拟器~

本作的游戏性比我想象中的要差，重复的任务玩法，很容易无聊，比较有用的是你可以从其中学到历史，游戏中的地图和一些建筑和历史是一一对应的（别以为我是在网上查的，游戏中有详细介绍，还有照片，这也是我又爱又恨的一点~）
游戏的任务基本上也就是委托，需要你在大大小小的城市中来回游走（这就很烦~）
所以游戏一开始我的建议是开图，最快捷的是用火车，基本上可以去大部分的城市，其次是用牛，走路是最不划算的，路上所花费的时间可能比你想象的还要长~
这个游戏最重要的是钱，赚钱是最重要的，在此推荐一个邪道赚钱小技巧。

[spoiler]当然我是不推荐的，如果你是一个好人就老老实实按游戏任务来，死太多就会直接结束游戏的~[/spoiler]
游戏的自由度还是很高的，其实所有的NPC你都可以和他们互动，只是他们不想而已~

76561198032898393,440650,Niche - a genetics survival game,3.8666666666666667,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",4,"Would recommend if you got it on sale. It is very much a 'create your own fun' sort of game, rather than having definite goal. However, it feels more like a well polished demo than a full release, and seems to completely overestimate its depth (particularly in Story Mode). The genetics system is quite basic, and you can see every gene your creatures have (unless you're in sandbox and disable it). Mutations are based solely on player input rather than occurring naturally. For a game in which the physical traits of the creatures is the main focus, the creature models are quite underwhelming, even considering the graphical style of the game. If this game had mod support or still received updates I think it would be much easier to recommend it at full price, but it has neither of those things.

Story Mode
Story mode is intended to be a sort of tutorial for new players. The (unskippable) tutorial does a good job of explaining the game, but really didn't need a whole game mode for it. This game mode has several genetic mutations unique to it (I *think* you can get the same genes in sandbox, just not as mutations). Which is a bit of an issue if you want to complete everything in a sandbox world. There are two main goals: get home, and keep a certain gene in your creatures the whole while. The game does not explain how to get home, and it does not point out the unique gene or its significance. I believe the intended way to play is to move to each new island, completely conquer it while adapting your creatures to it, and then move on to do the same to the next island (which you've probably chosen at random). If you choose to play that way, even if you know the fastest path home, don't die and restart, don't lose the special gene and restart - you're going to be spending many hours playing this way. Far too many for what this game has to offer. And you *are* going to die, and you *are* going to lose the gene, potentially *many* hours in to a run. And once you 'win', you get to keep doing what you've been doing this entire time, minus the stress of the special gene. There is also zero customization to this game mode's settings unless you want to use console commands.

Sandbox Mode
Sandbox Mode really illustrates the lack of features and depth of the features the game does have. You can customize what type of island you start on, the genes of your starting creatures, their lifespans, and the resources/animals that spawn. Most of these are an on/off switch, or a slider with a too limited range. A win condition can be set, but your options are very limited. Despite being the 'main' game mode, you are unable to get several mutations (locked behind story mode). Meaning you need to find outsider creatures that have those genes (if that is possible, I'm not sure), and invite them to your tribe. If you wanted to 100% the mutations menu, you're going to have to play Story Mode. I mentioned above that this is a 'make your own fun' game, but Sandbox really doesn't give you the options to make your world just as you want it.

Applying to both of the gamemodes 
It just gets repetitive and boring. Pick food, cut grass, breed, maybe move to another island that may or may not be mostly indistinguishable, die, repeat. And very little other than the breeding is interesting. Even that is shallow - choose two creatures with the traits you want, and if you don't want the baby, drown it. The genetics and mutation menus look a lot more complicated that they really are. As for food: gathering from anything is about the same. It's all about what your creature can gather, not its diet. Hunting is time-consuming and just not worth it unless you have extra creatures with good attack. Predators are dangerous, but you can just run away (or hide, if you clicked the appropriate colors and patterns in the mutation menu and got it to pass down). Moving to another island is risky, and often leads to undesirable creatures staying by berry bushing and harvesting them while everyone else travels. This gets old very quickly. The islands are also pretty bland. Other than a few different creatures and plants, they're mostly the same. Sometimes almost identical. 

Another review said this as well, but: Look at the screenshots. That's what you're playing. That's not a part of the game, that's pretty much all of it. What you see is what you get.

Despite all I've said above, I had some fun with it. I might go back to it in the future, but I doubt my thoughts will change on it. The creatures are interesting and cute, and while the gameplay isn't too complex, it can be punishing if you are unaware of the dangers, take too many risks, or are just unprepared. I haven't run into any bugs, and the game runs smoothly. Once you've figured out the interface, it's quite easy to use. Just get it on sale if you can wait. | Jogo ótimo para passar o tempo.  Mecânica simples e decisões que podem se tornar complexas.

76561198032898393,443810,This Is the Police,3.966666666666667,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy",1,"This is genuinely one of my favourite management games because it requires you to be a bit strategic with your mangement of the officers at your disposal. 

Anyhow. You are Jack Boyd, Freeburg's police chief and City hall plans to remove you at the end of tenure as the mayor plans to put his son in charge. You have a 100 days to get a retirement fund and bounce. How will you make it happen? 

It falls short on a few things such as it being a very very long game that could take up to 20 hours if not more but its filled with many suprising quests and other choices that do matter to the story. 


7/10, Would play again if i had so much patience and time. | I liked a lot of what This Is The Police does, but it's really hindered by some quite upsetting aspects that end up completely breaking immersion, making it boring and sometimes frustrating.

In short, it's a game where you play the police chief in the fictional city of Freeburg in 1985, and your job is to hire officers and detective, assign them to cases, and try to navigate the politics of being a police chief in a corrupt city. It's a cool idea and it really gripped me in the beginning.

But the first problematic point, for me, was - the game forces you to be corrupt. It's doesn't ""make it really hard"" to play without going bad, like for example Papers Please does. It literally forces you.
Very early in the game, I got an offer from the Mafia to basically start working for them. I declined. Two days later, I was informed - they didn't accept my negative answer, I'm working for them anyway. Started getting requests from them, and I just ignored those because - again - I didn't wanna be corrupt. A few more days later, the story informed me in a cutscene that I have been assassinated. The end.

Well, sh!t, why even pretend to give me a choice in this if it just means I die?

Fine, whatever. I restarted. My playthrough wasn't going that well anyway - I was being too nice and it resulted in officers and civilians being killed. Turns out, the best approach in every case is to be aggressive as hell. Got a hostage situation? Don't negotiate, that'll let him escape and get your officers killed. Just send SWAT in and shoot him in the head. It seems the best approach 100% of the time is to go for the kill, and once I realized that, my 2nd playthrough literally had a success rate of 100%.

Things were going great this time. I accepted that the game wants me to be corrupt, and I just fully embraced it this time. Did everything the mob asked. Perfectly handled every call that wasn't mob related, solved every detective case, the mayor was happy with me and so all my requests for upgrades were accepted. Everything was going great.
I reached day 30 almost bored, because everything was going so smoothly I didn't even need to think anymore. I started watching youtube videos on my 2nd monitor while playing, because the game alone just wasn't interesting enough, but I did want to continue the story. 
Then day 31 came, and there's a time jump. Not gonna spoil why, but the story jumps forward a couple of weeks. And when I got back... things were suddenly really bad. All of my officers were exhausted, overworked and unhappy. Some had 0 energy bars left. I had to have SOMEONE in the shift so I ordered some to stay and work, but that wasn't enough to deal with all the crimes that popped up, and suddenly I had to fail handling some calls, civilians die, the mayor was mad, and... worst of all, my best detective died in a car accident, fell asleep at the wheel because he was overworked.
What the f*ck. I get that the game needed to up the difficulty a bit because things were going too smoothly to be interesting, but taking me out only to f*ck up my squad and then bring me back to pick up the pieces? That's such a lousy way to do it. That's like saying ""well if you don't make mistakes, we will make mistakes for you"". Why do I even bother then?

Whatever. I was upset but the story was interesting enough I kept playing, and soon enough I had things under control again, and that's when things started getting interesting. I had a serial killer on the loose, which presented new challenges, plus I got a real opportunity to take out the mafia. A way out of corruption, I figured.

So I start working on both of these things, mainly focused on the mafia thing. Working up the ladder, arresting people and turning them against their superior, climbing and climbing on a mountain of evidence to reach the top.
Then, like 30 days later, I finally get the evidence I need to reach to top guy, and... oh, can't arrest him now. We got the final piece of evidence kinda late in the day and the lead detective on the case needs to go home. His shift ended, you see. And you can't make the arrest without him (well, you can, but you risk a significantly lower chance of success). 
Again, what kind of bullsh*t is this? This is the biggest bust of his career. This is taking down the mafia. This would make him a city hero, it's an arrest any detective dreams of, and... he's fine with putting it off until the day after tomorrow, because his shift just ended? What??
I was just so confused by this, that I actually forgot I have the option to order him to work tomorrow, meaning I'd only have to wait 1 night and not 2. So I waited another 2 days, and... by the morning of the 2nd - I get informed: I was too late to the arrest, the suspect got away.
Weeks of work, all down the drain because my lead detective couldn't work a bit of overtime to get the biggest bust of his life.

Add to that the annoyance during these couple of weeks where we literally have a serial killer on the loose, I need all hands on deck, and every day I got a few officers coming in saying sh!t like ""Hey I was reading a book last night and I really wanna finish it, can I get the day off?"" - No, of course you can't, there's a SERIAL KILLER terrorising the city. What is wrong with you?  

It was just too much. I get it, the story wants to hammer in the idea that everybody is corrupt in this city, the good guys don't always win, etc etc. Fine. But it feels like it uses dirty tricks to make these points, and with the game being this long (I got to day 80-something in 8 hours, and the game is supposed to be 180 days long, so I assume it would have taken around 18-20 hours to finish), and it's just too much. I can't take 10 more hours of this. 
If the entire playthrough was 8 hours long, that would have been fine. It was mostly enjoyable for that long. But realizing I'm not even halfway through and I have to endure so much more of this was... too much. I can't do it. | A fun little game. The main character and the storyline are compelling enough to keep me hooked for the entirety of the game. The game mechanics are fundamentally very simple. Initially, I believed there was an underlying complexity to the decisions and the management of the policemen, but this was not the case, or perhaps I missed it somehow. Ultimatelly, this did not detract from my experience, as the story was the primary driving force for me. I just wanted to know how it ends for Jack. 
What I didn't like, is that the game was unnecessarily long, and the management aspect didn't feel too challenging. Contrary to some online opinions/reviews that say the game can be really unfair, I myself did not felt that. However, I can understand how certain events might create an impression of unfairness. I was likely just fortunate that these events did not significantly impact my gameplay, leading me to conclude that the game was considerably easier than I expected.
At the end I really enjoyed my time with This is the Police and I would like to see if something changes with different decisions in another playthrough, but I won't. It just drags for too long, which might not be an issue if the much of that time wouldn't be just waiting.
So, my advice is play it, enjoy it, be glad that you did and move on. | Я придбав цю гру з двох причин: перша – сподобався візуальний стиль гри, а друга причина – це тому, що я і сам є поліцейським.

But the subtleties of tactics and strategy are absolutely fantastic to figure out along the way despite what look like incredibly simple mechanics. So it is an wonderful puzzle game wrapped in a tactical game that is wrapped in a builder game. While I am pretty much done with it, it will stay in my memory as one of the best games I have ever played.

 | Right now, Axes and Acres is half off for the Winter Sale, and I think that $4.99 is a fair price for what this is: a digital version of a typical European board-game.  It's not an American board-game, so it plays more like ""Settlers of Catan"" than ""Candyland.""  That means it's complicated at first, though it's very easy to learn if you watch TomChick's video of him playing it.  For what it is, it had the potential to be a great game: you build up your little hamlet from scratch each game, building houses, farms, guardhouses, town halls and so forth, and your peasants farm, chop trees, mine stone and reproduce, a game mechanic that requires two pawns instead of one for some inexplicable reason.  (Because your pawns aren't people, they are tiny dice-shaped figurines, so maybe they have one gender, or six.  I don't know.)

Anyway, the game is a lot of fun when you're playing it.  You only have so many dice each turn and only so much food, so you have to decide whether to build or farm and so forth.  Each game has random goals, such as ""Build 5 roads"" or ""Kill 3 barbarians"" and you have to work towards those goals in a set amount of turns.

And here is where the game goes from being great to being a near miss.  For some inexplicable reason, the game designers decided that foisting a super-complicated European-style digital board-game that has no real-world board game equivalent to it on an unsuspecting American teenage Steam populace would make these people go ""Oh, this is too complicated!  Make it harder!"" and so they decided that every time you win, the game would keep track, for every victory you would gain a Level, and the game would roughly subtract one turn for each victory.  So, if you are given 25 turns to win at Level 1, you only get 24 turns at Level 2, and 23 turns at Level 3.  

Now if you're great you may get to Level 50, if you're terrible you may get to Level 4, but at some point, every single person who plays will reach a maximum level where they can't go any higher, and so for them the game becomes an exercise in futility.   If you lose two games in a row, you lose a Level and gain back a turn, so you might rise to Level 50, lose 10 games and end up at Level 45.  I don't see this as a good thing, as you gain nothing.  

In various rogue-like and tower-defense games, you have a meta-game, where even if you lose terribly each game, you are still gaining gold, cards, skills or whatever, and so there is compensation for the game getting tougher.  ""Solar Settlers"" by the same company is a good example: you get cards permanently every time you play, and thus the entire game makes more sense and is always fun to play. 

So, I do recommend this game on sale.  It's worth playing for the 10 or 20 hours you'll get out of it before you find it frustrating and futile. | My favourite game of 2016.

Plays like a town building worker placement board game with some deck building on the side.

You are racing to meet your Victory Point target before you run out of turns. If you are successful you move on to the next phase where you keep all the infrastructure you have built, but the actions which give you Victory Points change. After you beat all three phases you win the map and increase one rank.

Each rank you go up increases the number of Victory Points required to beat the next map, however if you lose two maps in a row your rank decreases by one. This does a really good job of making sure things never get too hard or too easy for you. | Fun single player board game that gets slightly more difficult each time you win.

Elements of Worker Placement, Dice Rolling, Victory Point engine building, Light deckbuilding.

Would recommend for fans of Agricola, Empire, or even Civilisation. | These days it's extremely rare to see an original game design within the realm of video games. It's also hard to find elegant strategy games that are easy to learn and unfold their depth by the combination of relatively straight-forward rules. Axes and Acres delivers on both fronts!

The game resembles an economic solitaire board game, but uses the digital format to take full advantage of randomization (map, cards, goals, dice) to keep every playthrough fresh. All of the randomness happens before the player is making decisions though and can be mitigated in various ways, so it never feels unfair but more like a set of conditions you have to make the best out of every turn. 

On top of that, the game uses a ranking system to dynamically adjust the difficulty to the player's skill every match. It's a feature far too few single-player games use.

All in all this is, so far, probably the most interesting game I've played this year."

For example, when heat becomes a problem, you can't just build an air conditioner and call it a day. This game has the Law of Conservation of Energy (for the most part). You need to actually figure out how to move the heat somewhere else or convert it to another form of energy.

Cheating AI to compensate for being bit dumb is common practice in RTS games, but apparently the devs think that their AI is stupid beyond any redemption so they juiced all the cheating levers to the moon and the only thing that remains is artificial difficulty in the most boring and tedious way.

Raiding/attacking an AI is absolutely pointless unless you can actually destroy their main base. They're barely relying on population for their production and any villagers/military units you kill respawn almost instantly anyway so it's absolutely pointless to raid them.

The issue seemed a bit less apparent during the Campaign, so at least that part was bit better balanced. But trying out Conquest mode afterwards is just absolutely disgusting. It's doable, but an absolute drag cause it requires constant micromanagement to barely compensate for all the AI cheating. And even then it takes so long to finish off an opponent because raiding an AI does barely anything, so unless you're way way stronger the AI will just bounce back in the blink of an eye.

Bit of cheating would be fine, but I mean the AI units literally respawn like 2-3+ times faster, and their armies have barely any upkeep so it doesn't matter if you destroy their economy cause they will just field an army of 15+ units without any economy supporting them anyway. It's just a joke imo, this is not an actual challenge.

Please put some actual thought and at least a little bit of effort into your AI so the cheating doesn't have to be so blatantly in your face. 

It's a shame, cause the base game mechanics are interesting enough, the game looks nice visually and has a good theme. The campaign is decent and multiplayer might be fine, but beyond that the AI is a hot broken mess preventing you from having any fun. | Стратегия неплохая, особенно с друзьями, но отдельные кланы за 200 рублей каждый и сама игра которая стоит 1100 это конечно писдец.

Las diferentes estaciones hacen que tomes decisiones que ayuden a tu pueblo, ya que si tienen hambre, poca felicidad o están enfermos pueden ser un problema. Recomendado. | The amount of time I've put into this game is not a reflection of the quality of the game. It's a reflection of the very slow pace, and very steep learning curve. Basically, the first 30 minutes of any game, you're entirely on your own. You're competing against the elements, and trying to build up your colony. But then you encounter an opponent, and it becomes IMMEDIATELY clear if you did well to prepare for their invasion. Either you get steamrolled, or you do the steamrolling. There is not much exciting back and forth in this game, and it takes way too much time to get the repetitions in to figure out how to build up your base effectively. | Keep crashing on the Victory Screen.

But in the end, it feels more like a puzzle game (suss out the ""correct"" answer to a given problem), as opposed to a tactics game. 

Perhaps it's just me. This isn't my favorite genre by far. But with Frozen Synapse, I always felt like my decisions were planning routes through dangerous territory, not trial-and-error guessing until I found what the developers wanted me to do.

It's got style, and panache. If you're super into plan-and-go games, maybe give it a shot? Certainly wasn't for me, though. | I like the potential of this game.  Well worth the buy for what it is currently though IMO.

+Various roles
+Graphics
+What few maps they have are fun
+Allows for some very strategic positioning (distractions, fakes, timing, etc.)
+the 'play' ability is an awesome tool to try out new tactics and perfect your attack methods

-Not enough starting maps
-No true Single Player Missions/Campaign mode (only skirmishes)

	Очень простая идея игры, что игрок в роли короля старается править своим государством в максимально упрощённом стиле. Перед вами буквально меняются карты с людьми и их просьбами, которые можно только сбрасывать вправо или влево. От чего меняются параметры королевства. Всего их доступно 4: церковь, народ, армия и казна. При достижении одного в пороге максимум или минимум король умирает или изгоняется. Мда, правь хорошо и всё равно убьют! Задумано, что требуется держать все параметры приблизительно посередине. 

	Кроме правления есть мини игра по фехтованию в которой местами победить легко или сложно. Атака/защита продвигает персонажей вперед/назад от чего происходит движение по полю с клетками. Оказавшийся за краем погибает. Да, все действия принимаются исходя из выбранного ответа, который вы дадите карточке.

	Самое интересное происходит, когда удаётся вмешаться в конфликт, что слегка изменит местоположение игры и добавит новых карт болтунов. Изредка можно нарваться и на мощные бонусы. Например, высокая стена, что не позволит вашей армии опуститься ниже 0 или центральный банк, что возьмёт на себя часть трат из казны. Таких при себе возможно иметь только 4 штуки.

	К сожалению после часа игры вы столкнётесь с постоянными одинаковыми диалогами, ответы на которые уже известны. Да, в игре есть часть диалогов, где будет по факту один ответ. До конца доживут не многие, ведь предстоит дожить до 2000 года, когда и возможно получить 2 из 3 концовок в зависимости от ответа. Для достижения такого момента предстоит играть ну часа 4 наверное. Игра на первом получасе показывает всё что может предложить.

	Графика у игры простая, что и на первых смартфонах бы работало. Музыка достаточно приятная и простая.

The game emphasizes the importance of the daily decisions they must make. It's humbling to grasp the magnitude of the responsibility that comes with being an emergency dispatcher. It serves as a reminder of the value of rapid thinking and remaining calm under pressure in such vital moments.

So, while I may have killed more people than I saved, the game taught me a newfound appreciation for real-life dispatchers. It's intense, challenging, and very eye-opening.

Unfortunately this game did not deliver for me.

I found the core gameplay to be quite limited and boring. Essentially all you do is one of two things in this game, either 1) retrieve an item or  2) beat someone up. There's other mechanisms to attempt to make things more challenging or interesting but they fall short, for example there's locked door or security defense systems, but you can just easily blow up walls and get to the objective quite easily with little resistance. Even with random level generation it doesn't add much lasting value, as you still do the same objectives but with a slightly different level layout but without much added challenge.

The gamepad setup and multiplayer support really sucks, it's very difficult to setup multiple game pads and steam deck support is non existent. Menus require the use of a mouse to navigate, so not ideal with just a controller. It takes me at least 10-15 minutes to get 3 game pads synced up right. And then on multiplayer you all share the same game camera so you all have to stay close to each other. The game appeal wears off after like 20-30 minutes. The UI is very busy with lots of wording.

The level art design feels like you're in an underground subway and not in an open outdoor city environment. The level sizes are pretty small and limited. Personally I would have found the game a lot more appealing if it was more like GTA 2 with a larger city map and vehicles to drive and wide roads and going inside multi level buildings to complete one more challenging objective. Perhaps the enemy could try to flee and you all have to work together to chase or trap them. I think that 1-4 larger static maps would beat random small map genration for this type of game.

I'm hopeful for Streets of Rogue 2, but if it's too much like this one I don't think I'd buy that one if it has this same setup and limitations. | I can't just pick this game up and stop going run after run. It's got so many ways to play it's just got so much replay ability honestly one of my favorite games. The more you get the hang of each map and how to interact with everything the more rewarding it feels. (Vampires are my current favorite to play as) There as so many options I can't say enough how much fun I have even when I'm killed by random bs and have to start all over again I just keep coming back. | Замечательный рогалик, с действительно вариативными героями, которых, при этом, не сложно открыть. Прохождение игры может быть так же самым разным: от убийства всего населения до подкупа и тихой зачистки. А на выбор тут есть и вампиры, оборотни, инопланетяне (в длс), так и всякие ворюги, копы, рабовладельцы... К тому же, игра позволяет создавать и своего собственного персонажа, если ни один из доступных не подходит. Отлично подходит для коопных прохождений, главное брать персонажей, которые не мешают друг другу в выполнении главной миссии."

 | A chill and long factory building game on a massive hand-crafted world, resource nodes are inifinite and only you can destroy/desconstruct your buildings; so you can take your time in building big and beautiful factories around them, as there are plenty of customization options to make some striking architechture.

Making sure you build with verticality in mind and also in spaces that are bigger than you expect to use is important.

There's a blueprinter building that allows you to create blueprints but only within the constraints of the building. Which can force you to think modularly and vertically which is nice, however i feel you get this tool later than you'd want to, and upgrades to it you also unlock later than what you'd want, and by that time it doesnt give you enough space to even create a neat modular blueprint with newer bigger buildings, and also by the time you unlock its final upgrade you might not even need it anymore | Satisfactory, как и многие игры-песочницы с элементами стратегии и управления ресурсами, развивает в мозгу несколько когнитивных функций:

Пространственное мышление:  Игроки должны планировать и оптимизировать расположение фабрик, транспортных линий и добывающих установок в трехмерном пространстве.  Это требует визуализации и планирования в нескольких измерениях.

Планирование и стратегическое мышление:  Успешное прохождение игры требует тщательного планирования.  Игроки должны прогнозировать потребности в ресурсах, разрабатывать эффективные производственные цепочки, и адаптироваться к изменяющимся условиям.

Решение проблем: Satisfactory постоянно бросает игрокам вызовы.  Нехватка ресурсов, сложности с транспортом, ошибки в дизайне фабрики – всё это требует креативного и логического подхода к решению проблем.

Управление ресурсами:  Игра учит эффективно управлять ограниченными ресурсами, оптимизировать производство и минимизировать потери.  Это полезный навык, который можно применять и в реальной жизни.

Многозадачность:  Игроки часто сталкиваются с необходимостью одновременно выполнять несколько задач: добывать ресурсы, строить, модернизировать фабрики, исследовать территорию.

Креативность и инновации: Satisfactory предоставляет игрокам значительную свободу в проектировании своих фабрик.  Игроки могут экспериментировать с различными подходами и находить креативные решения для оптимизации производства.

Навыки решения сложных задач:  Игра может потребовать много времени и усилий на поиск оптимальных решений для очень сложных логистических проблем, что развивает навыки поиска информации, экспериментального подхода и системного мышления.

Важно отметить, что развитие этих навыков зависит от индивидуального подхода к игре и уровня сложности, который игрок выбирает.  Игра не является заменой формального образования или профессиональной подготовки, но может служить эффективным дополнением к развитию когнитивных функций. | Por favor alguien debe detener la fabrica... Se que la insdustria no necesita expandirse, debe expandirse, pero ya basta, mi mundo se volvio un desastre nuclear en formacion. Ya no se donde empiezo yo y donde acaba la fabrica, todo son maquinas... | This game reminded me that im playing for straight 6 hours me thinking it has been only 1 hour is crayz xD

I knew this game had good potential when i saw it, years ago i purchased this game thinking this is gonna be a good game in the future and devs gave us just that. Now i can finally play full version of this game and have fun with people i love.

You basicly create otomized factory produce from basic to more complicated stuff,
Unlock Tiers and Build Space Station along the way,
Go around scout and discover interesting places,
Find out you can have arachnophobia mode ON, so that you can see png Cats ""mewing"" around xD
Progression feels good, Creating factory and having a feel good moment when you spend hours on something and it works perfectly thats the second you will be proud of yourself!

I will deff suggest this game if you're going to play coop it is much easier when you have someone with you.
Alone would make things much more slower in my opinion, more the better..."
76561198032898393,527230,For The King,2.05,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",2,"really struggled with the game first time trying; it was just me and my bf aand it was very hard to manage support/damage balance as a group of only two- we either went full damage and suffered on healing/buffing and died as a result; or either one of us would take up full support role and we'd still die due to insufficient party damage. 

it seems the sweet spot is to have a three people group; we had a friend join up recently and we're currently on our third map. been really fun. idk how it goes on hard mode but we're slowly getting there. [spoiler] game has its ass moments sometimes; you get f load of gold at the final objective- the campaign ends :D can't spend it or have it accumulate in some sort of other type of currency too...wow you're trolling your players!! how unique of you XD [/spoiler] | This is overall a fun game that's well executed, but decisions by the developers ruin the fun for me.

I really enjoyed this game to start, but it constantly kicks you in the nuts. Get a great weapon? It'll break on a critical botch. Fight a master thief? He'll steal all your character's gold and even if you kill him, you can't get it back. Get hit with an acid attack? It'll randomly destroy a piece of gear every other tick or so. 

If you've got a high tolerance for losing, maybe this won't be a deal breaker for you, but it was for me. This game warns you up front that your party will die, but I *wasn't* dying. I was doing great, I was just constantly losing my loot, which totally killed the fun for me. Games are supposed to be fun, so for that reason alone, I cannot recommend it.

Also the interface randomly stopped letting me access my inventory during combat, which meant I couldn't use my panaxes to cure the acid that was destroying my loot. Not sure if that was a bug or a game mechanic, but it was the final straw. If you're a loss tolerant player, this is still a good game, but if the idea of doing a quest for a sweet purple sword only to critically botch and have it get destroyed ON THE VERY FIRST USE (happened to me), then save your blood pressure and skip this game. | Вот они, Герои, которые спасут человечество:

 | A solid game in the genre. It doesn't wow or offend. I keep meaning to play this and campus more but the game just doesn't hold my attention.

Status: To the backlog
Pickup on a sale.
Suffers from market saturation. | 好玩，本身在Switch上面玩，然后又重新买了重新玩 | Growing up, I loved ""Theme Hospital"", and this game feels like the same to me. It's not everyone's kind of game, but I love it. It's a pretty easy (at first anyway) hospital simulator game. Worth noting it's better to buy it when all the DLC goes on sale."
76561198032898393,548430,Deep Rock Galactic,39.2,Action,11,"这是个可玩性非常高的游戏，本体基本上是所有内容，dlc都是皮肤啥的，可以不买可以支持，对游戏体验感提升极大的是mod，可以自己装上很多辅助mod，当然最需要的还是一起玩的朋友，暑假拉我入坑的同学已经不玩了，当时我们俩菜死了连一级任务都打不过，现在玩了两百多小时已经变得可以独自处理很多事情了，但是他早就走了。 | I think Deep Rock Galactic is a great game because it’s fantastic to play with others, it offers a wide variety of skins (which allows you to customize your character), it’s well-optimized, and the characters are excellently balanced.

The Driller can tunnel through walls, which is especially useful during evacuations. The Gunner has impressive firepower and can significantly support the team. The Engineer can deploy turrets that shoot at enemies and aid in navigation. The Scout is very fast and excels at scouting the terrain.

All in all, I believe Deep Rock Galactic is an outstanding game. I think it’s absolutely worth its price. | Хороший кооператив, интересные универсальные снаряжение каждого из дворфов, которых в игре 4, у каждого есть по 3 разного основного и дополнительного оружия, каждый из которых можно улучшать разными модификаторами из-за чего меняется механика самого оружия и билда соответственно, есть большой выбор костюмизации под каждого дворфа и на любой вкус, и этот выбор периодически пополняется, если играть в одиночку то может быстро наскучить, но в онлайне намного интереснее проходить уровни и лутать всё что откопаешь, ещё в игре есть ивенты с выходом боевого пропуска, благо после выхода другого пропуска ивенты не убирают и встречаются не на всех уровнях, поэтому они не надоедают, в общем и целом игру советую | 十分好玩的游戏，沙盒以及高自由度和丰富的配装思路使得这款游戏在游玩时间上能够到达几百小时不是问题。社区对新手玩家友好，上手难度适中的同时上限也高。虽然再多人联机中会存在一些不友好行为，但这部分玩家群体是深岩玩家中少数中的少数。

游戏也会存在我个人看来的一些缺陷

游戏中的语音交流缺失。大多数对局玩家间的交流偏少，语言交流甚至无交流是主流现象。对这部分有需求的玩家需要考虑一下。
游戏深度存在不足。目前深研银河的更新进展处于后期阶段。虽然游戏依然具有很大的更新潜力，但开发者目前更新的主要精力并不在深研银河上。游戏玩法多样，但实际游玩中你可以感受到还有更多的细节可以打磨完善，世界观可以拓展。

以满分10分的评判标准，我会为深研银河给出8.8分的成绩。

希望这个评论对你们有所帮助 :3 | I'll keep it short: Deep Rock Galactic is a really fantastic co-op, or solo, experience for anyone that enjoys taking on fun, dynamic missions while fighting off relentless waves of bugs. The gameplay is really quite fun, and there are lots of options to upgrade and change your loadout as you progress. Monetization is refreshing, with all in-game items earned through play rather than pay, and older cosmetic items still obtainable through luck and persistence. Although I haven’t played in a while and can’t speak to the latest seasonal updates, the developers have a solid track record of keeping things fresh.

 | Играешь в Skyrim, думаешь, сейчас быстренько выполню квест, а потом вдруг оказываешься на другом конце карты, спасая какого-то дракона от крыс. В итоге забыл, зачем вообще пришёл в эту деревню. Местные жители, кажется, тоже в шоке — они ждут, что ты спасёшь мир, а ты пытаешься вспомнить, где оставил своего коня. И да, стрелы в коленях, кажется, стали новой модой. Если вам нравятся приключения, где можно забыть обо всём на свете и просто наслаждаться хаосом, то Skyrim — ваш идеальный выбор! | Играю в это творение с самого его выпуска на просторах интернета. Некогда меня посадил в нее брат, и это была лучшая рекомендация по играм, которую он мог мне когда-либо дать. Цифру, которую видят пользователи рядом с моей иконкой, это может, дай Бог, 1/10 часть всех проведенных часов за этой игрой. Да, когда выпускалась игра, мне было 9 лет, и я играла по своему незнанию и неумению с чит-кодами, тем не менее, освоившись с годами, поняла, что куда интереснее, когда имеешь риск, чем читы, которые ограничивали и делали тебя непобедимым. Да, всех фишек игры вдоль и поперек мне узнать по сей день не удалось, и я к этому не стремлюсь. 
Эта игра стоит того, чтобы вы ей уделили внимание, как минимум потому, что это огромный открытый мир с неимоверно широким выбором заданий. И, лично я, до сих пор не видела в гейминге игр, которые бы хоть чуть-чуть сравнивались с ней. Не спорю, опережая негативные возгласы, есть уйма других не менее проработанных хороших игр, но, по моему мнению, это не то. Skyrim тот самый прорывной проект 2011-го год, который до сих пор держит геймеров у экранов, так и вовлекая из года в год перепройти его заново.
Запуская игру, ты идешь туда уже далеко не ради графики, ибо, конечно, стоит признать, что для 2025-го года это уже не аргумент. Ты идешь ради неповторимого сюжета, который всего через пару игровых сессий так и просит подпевать бардам в таверне ""Герой он бесстрашный, он непобедим..."". Ведь герой, Довакин - это ты, человек неопределенной расы, который неведомым образом попадается на пересечении границы и оказывается тем, кто спасет весь мир. Причем игра дает возможность спасти Скайрим абсолютно разными способами: как будучи воином в драконьих доспехах с секирой Вутрад наперерез, так и крысой из Гильдии, тыркающей противников на х10 урона бритвой Мерунеса. Продвигаясь по разным сюжетным линиям, ты обретаешь многих верных сторонников (даже включая продажных наемников в тавернах, которые в последующем могут и отдаться Боэтии ради тебя). Некоторых из них имеется возможность брать в напарники, в зависимости от направленности твоего персонажа: нужен ли тебе лучник или  шут с кинжалом. Надоело рубить драконов, сражая их своим воинственным голосом? Пойдем, отыщем лук Ауриэля и будем жечь вампиров. Не хочешь? Пошли выпьем с незнакомцем в баре по кружке эля и узнаем, что тот даэдра гулянок. Хочешь тихой семейной жизни? Купи участок, построй особняк своей мечты и устройся там, может быть даже с мужем/женой и детьми. 
Устав от всех этих историй и геройств, ты можешь просто взобраться на холм под вечер с чистым небом и наблюдать за звездами. Звездные каскады - это не менее прекрасная причина прогуляться по просторам Скайрима и его окрестностям.
А для любителей мультиплеера создатели придумали онлайн версию, с которой вы можете также ознакомиться.
Но есть и свои ""-"" у сие произведения. Наиболее сущей проблемой стали для меня баги, когда я впервые зашла в официальную версию игры. Особенно по отношению к  компаньонам: передвижение в виде чистой модельки, исчезновение их частей тела, застревание в приседе, отставания от главного героя на половину карты и даже невозможность их выхода из локаций. В таких ситуациях спасают некоторые коды и частые сохранения, однако оставляет неприятный осадок. Тем не менее, это даже иногда забавляет и добавляет юмора в серые будни средневекового главного героя.
Даже спустя 13 лет после релиза, мне не надоели эти образы, байки, сюжетные повороты. Это как хорошее вино, с каждым годом только вкуснее. Смакуйте, друзья, а потом идите в не менее прекрасные проекты, как этот! | Sem sombra de dúvidas esse é o melhor RPG que já joguei, até dá pra jogar sem mods, mas não recomendo. Possuo atualmente 80 horas neste jogo incrível, metade delas apenas colocando mods e corrigindo para obter a perfeição

 10/10 pode comprar 15 pila é troco de pão. | He caminado por los valles helados de Skyrim, donde los vientos ululan como los lobos y las montañas tocan los cielos con sus picos nevados. Mi regreso a esta tierra fue tan inesperado como la caída de un dragón , y mi misión, encomendada por fuerzas invisibles, me llevó a cuestionar no solo mi destino, sino también el significado de la libertad.
Al principio, como nuestros ancestros sumerios balbucearon palabras en su lenguaje primigenio, yo también me encontré balbuceando entre decisiones que parecían dictadas por voces sin rostro. Dónde quedaba el libre albedrío del que tanto alardeamos. Al principio, odié este acometido impuesto por los escritores de mi destino en estos lares, pero poco a poco, entendí que mi periplo no era solo una línea invisible que seguir. Había un propósito más profundo, una razón que no podía ignorar.
Avanzar en esta tierra inhóspita no fue sencillo. Mi mazo dejó su huella en las carnes de muchos enemigos, y cada golpe arrancó no solo trozos de sus vidas, sino también fragmentos de mi tiempo. Vi los horrores de la guerra en Whiterun, sentí la frialdad de los glaciares en Hibernalia, y escuche los susurros de conspiraciones en la Hermandad Oscura. Cada paso que daba, cada batalla que libraba, me llevaba más cerca de una verdad que intentaba ignorar: las familias que formamos son lo que verdaderamente importa.
Recorrí los pasillos del Colegio de Bardos y canté canciones que no entendía. Me adentré en las cavernas del aquelarre de Namira, donde las sombras guardan secretos que ninguna luz puede revelar. Combatí junto a los Compañeros, los Ruiseñores y los Orcos tribales, cada una de estas familias con sus propios conflictos y códigos. Pero, por mucho que intentaran abrazarme como uno de los suyos, siempre sentía que algo faltaba. No eran mi verdadera familia.
Y entonces la vi. Con su canastita llena de flores marchitas y su sonrisa frágil, caminaba por los campos de batalla sin clamar por gloria ni riquezas. Todo lo que quería era un hogar, alguien a quien llamar “papá” o “mamá”. No buscaba los placeres mundanos que otros persiguen. En ella encontré algo que había olvidado en mi corazón endurecido por las guerras: la inocencia y el anhelo de pertenecer.
Decidí que la adoptaría y le daría lo que yo no tuve: un refugio seguro, un hogar donde pudiera soñar sin miedo. Pero para hacerlo necesitaba un lugar donde ella pudiera vivir. Ahorré cada moneda que gané en mis hazañas, vendí trofeos de guerra y trabajé incansablemente. Finalmente, conseguí una casa, un lugar al que ella podría llamar suyo. Pero la guerra estalló el día que iba a darle la noticia. Mis misiones chocaron y, en medio del caos, ella desapareció.
Busqué en todas partes, temiendo lo peor. Ningún pueblerino había ayudado a la niña que vendía flores para sobrevivir; ¿por qué lo harían ahora? Imagine su cuerpecito inerte bajo los escombros, olvidado por los débiles e inútiles druidas que no pudieron salvarla. Mis pasos eran pesados, no solo por los trofeos que llevaba, sino por el peso de mi corazón quebrado. La crueldad de esta vida no tiene límites, pero incluso en medio de la barbarie, recordé por qué empecé esta travesía. No podía rendirme.
Cuando finalmente la encontré, algo había cambiado. Ya no era la niña frágil que conocí. Tal vez era ella, o tal vez una sombra de lo que había sido. Pero adoptarla y verla sonreír nuevamente me hizo entender que nuestras acciones tienen un impacto que trasciende nuestro entendimiento. No era solo una niña sin hogar; era una oportunidad para redimir lo que quedaba de mi humanidad.
En un rincón perdido de la historia nórdica, se cuenta la leyenda de una niña huérfana que vagó sola durante años en los desiertos de hielo tras la muerte de su familia en una guerra clánica. Nadie la ayudó, nadie la quiso, hasta que un guerrero la encontró desmayada en la nieve. A pesar de su corazón endurecido por las batallas, el guerrero la llevó a su hogar y la crió como su propia hija. Con el tiempo, ella se convirtió en una gran sanadora, conocida no por las cicatrices que llevaba, sino por la paz que traía. ¿No es acaso esa la prueba de que incluso en los lugares más oscuros, hay esperanza?
Esta historia, aunque llena de tragedias y sangre, es un reflejo de nuestra propia realidad. Hoy, incluso, hay guerras que arrasan con las vidas de seres queridos. La humanidad, a lo largo de su historia, ha manchado sus manos con tinta roja, escondiendo sus crímenes bajo el velo de la victoria. Si me lees, te imploro: haz lo que puedas para Ayudar a alguien aunque sea una vez en tu vida, dándole palabras de ánimo, o un poco de comida o lo que tu corazón desee dar en ese momento, no por recompensa ni por honor, sino porque también podrías estar en sus zapatos, porque varias veces esos pensamientos rondan nuestra mente.
Me despido con un abrazo gélido, como los vientos de Skyrim, y un saludo cargado de las tragedias que he visto. Que mi historia sirva como un recordatorio de que incluso en los lugares más oscuros, la luz de la compasión puede brillar."

The gameplay is easy to understand and easy to master yet satisfying when you win. Not a huge time commitment for each round, but plenty of content to dive into if you so desire.

so what's the problem?

It's a port of a mobile game that has the bait/in game purchases removed but the adjustment that has been made to the reward system is insufficient. So in a game that's designed to have parts that can not be beaten until you attain better units, goading you into a purchase. You are stuck and forced to grind to obtain the ingame currency, which is very very limited unless you are able to win multiplayer matches, of which there are few because the game has so few players.


They have written in updates that the mobile versions have reduced drops, but i've played both and the grind is just as bad on the computer. Really rubs salt in the wound that you paid for a game on faith only to find out there's a free version. I'm not even going to ask for a refund i'm going to leave this review up to let people know to not waste their money.

I hope the devs see this and consider a rebalance of currency, or perhaps a larger assortment of units and cards upon purchase, more frequent drops of rewards. 
I would buy a dozen copies of this game for my friends, but I don't want them to be stuck after the first campaign like I am.  Whatever, it needs something to make the game progress feel like actual progress. | I paid for this game in Early Access and then it became free to play.

TL;DR:
- Très bien si vous aimez les wargames escarmouches
- Très bien si vous aimez réfléchir à l'optimisation
- Très bien si contrairement aux boulets vous lisez les règles
- Très bon rapport qualité prix
[Edit après plusieurs MAJ]
- Attention à ceux qui jouent LENTEMENT. Qui prennent une vie pour choisir un déplacement, une vie pour une carte. Oui, y en a pas mal alors prenez de quoi lire.
- Il y a des escarmouches où les dés sont contre vous. Vous avez beau prendre en tenaille, avoir plus de dés et jouer des cartes spéciales, l'ennemi remporte les assauts. Oui, c'est très improbable mais pas impossible. Et bien des fois votre réacteur à improbabilité s'emballe et vous passez une partie à subir misérablement une stratégie adverse nulle, mais bénie par Benten de bout en bout.


J'adore les wargames. J'ai joué plein de batailles dans mon salon ou dans mon garage, parfois des week end entiers. C'est un ami qui m'a parlé de ce jeu, et j'ai voulu essayer. 6€ ça me semblait pas très cher. Et ça les vaut largement.

J'ai lu des avis de rageux qui ne comprennent pas les dés, ni les cartes, ni la raison de la perte de dés. C'est sûr que s'ils n'ont pas lu les règles (RTFM!!! ou LCPDM en français) ils ne vont rien comprendre du tout et passer à côté du jeu. Donc n'écoutez pas ces avis idiots.

J'ai aimé ce jeu car il est assez exigeant dans la tactique et la stratégie. 
- Tactique car il faut bien choisir ses placements (si je mets mon personnage là, son samouraï devra soit le charger, soit le contourner, ce qui me laissera le temps de redéployer mon archer derrière cette palissade, par exemple.), bien choisir le moment de jouer une carte (si j'attends ce lancé de dé, je pourrais accumuler assez d'honneur pour combiner ces deux cartes, par exemple), bien choisir sa cible (si je focus ce plus faible, je pourrai prendre en tenaille le plus fort et lui faire perdre des dés et du déplacement) etc.
- Stratégique car il faut bien choisir son équipe. J'ai croisé des équipes que de tireurs, ou que de trois gros lourds; bref des équipes dont les personnages s'articulaient mal entre eux, qui ne faisaient pas synergie. De même il n'y a pas de cartes miracles. Dans mon deck j'ai peu de grosses cartes, mais j'ai des combinaisons de petites cartes et ça passe très bien. 

Enfin j'ai aimé car je n'ai rien dépensé une fois le jeu acheté. J'ai fini la campagne, j'ai plus de personnages ""doré"" que j'ai de place dans mes équipes, j'ai toutes les cartes en double exemplaire. Je ""détruits"" mes cartes en trop et mes figurines pas assez rares pour récupérer des poussières et fabriquer ce dont j'ai envie ou besoin. 

Y a que du multi et pas assez de solo, c'est vrai. Mais le temps de trouver une partie j'ai le temps de lire un webcomic. Les parties ne sont pas très rapide. J'ai pas chronométré mais ça doit faire dans les 5 à 10minutes. Mais si on aime les batailles c'est très bien. | I think this game is great except for a couple of things that I feel might make other players not even bother. 

1. Your units don't gain honor (xp) in the single player campaign. I don't really mind playing the multiplayer except that the Arena (which is a second multiplayer mode) doesn't seem to have anyone playing it and after playing 150 hard-earned coins for access I just sit waiting for a player. This also means that the arena quests are mostly worthless as there doesn't seem to be anyone playing. Again, all this would be a non-issue if I could just level up my units in the single player campaigns which are fun (if short) 

2. I don't mind grinding the single player campaigns to get coins through quests/achievements but you only get three quests at a time. One is a regular multiplayer quest (like kill 10 enemies in multiplayer), the second is an arena quest that after the initial one, you will never complete. The third is a single-player quest but there's a catch. The quests require you to complete the same campaign in all the difficulty levels before you get quests for the other two campaigns. When you get the ""Complete Cutthroats Campaign at Insane difficulty"" you will need to have leveled up your units to max level to even have a chance of completing that quest. Since Arena is dead and the single player requires leveled units to complete the quest, you're stuck grinding the regular multiplayer for hours and hours. This gets especially tedious once you've completed 50% or so of the acheivements (which also give coins) 

Since the arena multiplayer community is pretty much dead, this ends up being a great game that you can't really get all the best from. If the devs would enable leveling in single-player and perhaps add more quests then this game would be on my all-time top 10 pc games. Even then, the single player is so fun that I'd easily put it in the top 20. | THIS GAME HAS NO MEANINGFUL PVE - just need to get that out the way, to avoid any disappointment.
The core of the game is collecting & levelling troops, and PvE doesn't contribute to either (negligible loot & no XP) - in fact, aside from the tutorial, you really shouldn't even attempt PvE until you have PvP'd yourself some stronger troops.

** Pros **
Really interesting videogame concept, well executed with a very nice price point.
The game is heavily random (as dice based), but there's nonetheless plenty to do strategically.
The PvP seems to be very pick-up-and-play; you don't have to socialize and there's no chat.

** Cons **
Seeing as how quick PvP skirmishes form the bulk of gameplay, it gets pretty repetitive for a game that needs to be played a lot to make progress.
While well presented, afraid I just found the setting & units very bland and hard to distinguish; there's no fantastical units (e.g. sorcerers or oni), no ninjas, or even simply unique characters - nor is there any world-building of note.

In conclusion: excellent value 'hobby game' if you are in the market & don't want the temptation of microtransactions, but don't expect memorable PvE or story-telling - really hope that the developers plan expansions, or to use this engine/model for miniature games in livelier settings."

I have NEVER experienced a game lasting longer on this platform than real life, its usually much shorter.  You can try so many board games for FREE and with friends from all over the country.  Also instead of using steam, you can use most browers directly from their website. | Кидалово. Покупал игру, а в итоге ее сделали бесплатной. Ну как бесплатной... нужно еще покупать подписку. Не купив подписку, вы получаете урезанные настольные игры. Разработчики русские, а переведенных на русский язык игр штук 10. Нафига нужна эта тейблтопия, если есть TTS, который один раз купив, позволяет играть в любые игры. | Несмотря на то, что уже давно являюсь обладателем Tabletop Simulator (далее TS), решил опробовать и это приложение, ибо настольные игры давно уже являются частью моей жизни. На момент приобретения игра еще дорабатывается и, надеюсь, некоторые вещи в ней изменятся к лучшему.
Не буду описывать, что это за игра, перейду сразу к плюсам и минусам. И начну, пожалуй, с минусов:
1. Мало игр - когда я только приобрел это приложение, игр было около 280, сейчас уже более 290 - и это меньше чем за неделю. Пусть новые игры появляются практически каждый день, все равно это ничтожно мало по сравнению с внушительным ассортиментом в TS, к тому же здесь нет многих интересующих меня настольных игр - того же Риска, Андора, Ужаса Аркхэма и многих других. Впрочем, приложение развивается, и надежда есть.
2. Нет поддержки мастерской Steam, а значит, придется уповать лишь на разработчиков и ждать, когда они добавят новые игры. Хотя есть тут вроде как собственная мастерская, где можно делать свои наработки, но я там пока не нашел ничего стоющего внимания.
3. Управление - минус скорее субъективный, тем более после TS, где управление лично мне показалось довольно интуитивным. Здесь же я постоянно мучаюсь с попытками собрать карты в стопку и стопку эту перемешать, так же трудно взять карты в руку. Броски кубика тоже какие-то невнятные и напоминают скорее генератор случайных чисел, нежели реальные броски. Не увидел возможность делать ""зону невидимости"", как в том же TS дабы скрыть свои жетончики, карты или еще что от других игроков.
4. Нет возможности игры Hotseat - приходится искать других игроков онлайн. Так же нет возможности создать закрытую частную комнату - любой игрок может зайти и посмотреть, кто во что играет. Я в этом смысле не из стеснительных, но все же это как-то странно.
5. Английский язык - ну, не совсем минус, скорее неудобство, и то не для меня, а для многих моих друзей, с которыми поиграть из-за этого проблематично. Игры на русском здесь есть, но их довольно мало, особенно удивляет, что пара отечественных игр - Зельеварение и Эволюция - присутствуют здесь лишь на английском языке, как будто их не в России придумали.
Пожалуй, минусы кончились, перейду к плюсам:
1. Удобство - практически все игры уже готовы к началу партии, загружай и играй в свое удовольствие. К тому же на страничке игры можно найти ссылку на правила, да и в самой игре есть возможность их открыть. За это твердая 5!
2. Оптимизация - в отличие от TS Tabletopia сносно пошла у меня на относительно слабой системе, пусть этот плюс и довольно субъективный)) Загружается и работает все довольно быстро, графика приятная.
3. Потенциал - надеюсь, что у фанатов будет возможность добавлять сюда собственные настольные игры, чтобы выбор был побогаче, но и сейчас уже видно, что игр становится все больше и больше, так что ждемс.
Вывод: хороший симулятор настольных игр за свои деньги, позволяет играть в настолки, если вдруг вы не можете собратья за одним столом с друзьями - вдруг вас жизнь по разным городам раскидала. Пусть пока тут нет, к примеру, виртуальных столов для игры в D&D, сыграть партейку в Settlers или Village уже можно. А недостатки, надеюсь, временные. | I am now paying a subscription fee and cannot find a way to get rid of it / I Had to pay $11.46 to play a game I bought on the 27th of December and just got charged another $14.36 on the 28th of December.

With the number of hours I'd played I even spent over 100$ supporting the game by buying skins and what not. I enjoyed the flow, the challenge, and the strategy. I know every card. How they're played. How they're countered. 

So why am I giving it a negative review now?  I recently came back to it to find out the game had completely changed. 

Why oh why have the devs decided to remove wild cards (doubles of the same card in the same deck) and duplicate cards (the same card in your teammates deck) in premade team battles?? Half the fun of this game was being able to strategize with a friend and come up with crazy combos, thematic decks, and sometimes just plain goofy ridiculous decks early in the league. I strongly believe the percent chance of drawing a deck defining card or executing your intended combo is a key element of dueling cards in general. Think Magic or Yu Gi Oh. Now a huge part of that fun and build design is just gone.

Effectively, they've changed the game that I originally fell in love with and after over 800 hours I don't think I want to play anymore. What a shame. | Rating: 7/10

Overview: Minion Masters is a fast-paced, free-to-play strategy game that blends elements of tower defense and collectible card games (CCG). Developed by BetaDwarf, the game pits players in 1v1 or 2v2 battles where they summon and control minions to battle against their opponent’s forces, all while managing a deck of cards. With its unique mix of gameplay styles, Minion Masters offers an accessible but strategic experience for fans of both strategy games and card battling.

Gameplay: In Minion Masters, players build and use decks of cards to summon minions, cast spells, and build structures on the battlefield. Each card corresponds to a different type of unit, spell, or structure that players can deploy in real-time. The key to success is not just about deploying powerful units but also about managing your resources (mana), timing your plays, and reacting to your opponent’s strategy.

The game offers several different modes, including standard 1v1 and 2v2, where players can compete against other players or AI. The matches are quick, lasting around 5-10 minutes, which makes it easy to jump into a game and not get bogged down by long sessions. The action is fast-paced, with constant back-and-forth gameplay, making it exciting for those who enjoy real-time strategy with a bit of card game strategy mixed in.

Deck Building and Strategy: The strategic depth of Minion Masters comes from deck building. Players can collect new cards and customize their deck to suit their playstyle, with different minions, spells, and special abilities available to choose from. The key to winning is finding the right balance between offense and defense, while also considering synergy between the cards in your deck. There are a variety of minion types, each with strengths and weaknesses, which adds an extra layer of tactical decision-making to each match.

Progression and Monetization: As with many free-to-play games, Minion Masters includes a progression system where players can unlock new cards and cosmetics by earning rewards from matches or purchasing card packs. While the game is generally balanced and not pay-to-win, there is an option for players to spend money on card packs and other cosmetic items. This could give some players a slight advantage early on, but most progress can still be made through regular gameplay.

Graphics and Performance: Minion Masters features bright, colorful visuals with a somewhat cartoonish art style that fits the fast-paced, playful nature of the game. The minions and spells are well-designed, with each card having its own unique look and animations that help bring the battlefield to life. The game runs smoothly on most systems, and the controls are intuitive, making it accessible for both new players and strategy veterans alike.

Audio Design: The sound design in Minion Masters is solid, with an upbeat soundtrack and engaging sound effects that add to the excitement of the battles. Each card and minion has its own set of sounds, from the footsteps of marching troops to the explosive effects of spells, helping to immerse players in the game’s action. The voice lines of the minions and the announcer are charming and add some personality to the game.

Challenges: While Minion Masters is accessible, there is a learning curve when it comes to building effective decks and mastering the timing and positioning of your units. As players unlock more cards, they can start building more diverse strategies, but the game’s fast pace means you need to react quickly, which can be challenging for newcomers. The game also features matchmaking, but occasionally, you may find yourself up against opponents who have stronger cards if you're not progressing quickly enough.

Final Thoughts: Minion Masters is a fun and fast-paced strategy game that offers a unique blend of collectible card gameplay with real-time strategy. Its quick matches, deck-building mechanics, and strategic depth make it an enjoyable experience for players who enjoy both card games and strategy games. While there’s a progression system that could feel grindy at times, the game remains accessible, and its focus on skill and strategy makes it rewarding for those who stick with it.

Pros:

Fast-paced and accessible gameplay
Strong strategic depth through deck-building and unit placement
Bright, colorful visuals with appealing animations
Free-to-play with fair monetization options
Multiple game modes including 1v1 and 2v2
Cons:

Progression can feel slow at times
Pay-to-progress elements, though not pay-to-win
Some balancing issues, especially at early levels
Can become repetitive if not switching up strategies
Minion Masters is an enjoyable strategy game for those who like quick battles, tactical decision-making, and card collection. While there are some minor progression hurdles, the game offers a solid and fun experience for fans of competitive, strategic gameplay. | This game was fun for a while.

Что мне нравится:

Миньоны-психопаты. Серьезно, кто еще будет бросать летающих свиней в драконов? Это гениально!

Стратегия? Шутка? И то, и другое! Ты думаешь, что всё продумал, но тут твой противник выкидывает карту, которая превращает твою армию в лягушек. Лягушек, Карл!

Что не нравится:

Случайные карты. Иногда тебе выпадает такая рука, что хочется плакать. Но это часть веселья, правда?

Итог: Minion Masters — это идеальная игра для тех, кто хочет немного адреналина, много смеха и возможность почувствовать себя злым гением (или просто неудачником с хорошим чувством юмора). Если вы еще не играли, то что вы вообще делаете со своей жизнью?

Still, what is there is polished and condensed to perfection. | I really want to like this game, and I have liked other games from this publisher and the genre. However, the roguelike elements of this game are more about punishing new players with ""gotcha"" moments, where your ignorance of the game mechanics is severely punished. Such as certain squad/mission combos are not winnable, though you can still unknowingly select them, but new players wouldn't know this until they figure it out through trial and error. The learning curve is more about ""really?"" moments of frustration than intuitive insight into how to play the game.

This game is an example of how we need an option between ""yes"" and ""no"" on steam reviews. If these types of roguelike games are for you, then I can see the appeal and there is surely a place in the genre for this and games like this.

Sem contar em players da europa e asia jogando no US East, com pings altos (bem no limite colocado pelo dev.) para poder usar cheat e ""atrapalhar"" a vida de quem quer jogar normal.

 | Gives you a good representation of the inner workings of an airport. Everything feels natural in the sense that you don't have to watch advanced tutorials to understand how to play it. Definitely recommend for easy going players. Absolute gem. | [h1]SimAirport[/h1]

[h2]Overview[/h2]  
*SimAirport* is an indie simulation game where players take on the role of managing and building their own airport. From the ground up, you’ll design terminals, manage staff, build facilities, and handle logistics to ensure smooth operations. It's a strategic and often chaotic challenge, balancing customer satisfaction, security, and air traffic—all while dealing with inevitable delays and problems that arise in the world of aviation.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]  
In *SimAirport*, you’ll be tasked with constructing terminals, creating runways, and managing flight schedules. The game offers a variety of features including passenger services, staff management, and security protocols. There’s a fine balance between efficient airport operation and customer comfort, as you deal with baggage handling, queues, and inevitable technical glitches. It’s not just about managing an airport, but also about optimizing every corner to make it run like a well-oiled machine.

[h2]Graphics[/h2]  
While not as polished as some larger-budget titles, *SimAirport* has a quirky, somewhat retro graphical style that works well with its detailed simulation mechanics. The interface and design may feel a bit basic, but the focus is on the gameplay, which is immersive enough to make up for it. The visual representation of an airport in full swing is surprisingly satisfying.

[h2]Sound[/h2]  
The game’s sound design includes the hum of airport activity—announcements, the whir of conveyor belts, and the roar of planes taking off. While not overly complex, the soundscape contributes to the immersive environment of a bustling airport. The absence of a rich soundtrack is noticeable, but it allows players to focus more on the management side of things.

[h2]Customization[/h2]  
Customization is a key feature in *SimAirport*. You’ll be able to design the layout of your terminals, manage flights, and even tweak how passengers move through the airport. You can also change the appearance of various elements, like how your staff is dressed or the look of your buildings, but it's mainly functional customization for gameplay rather than aesthetic design.

[h2]Replayability[/h2]  
With endless possibilities in airport design and the random challenges that come with each playthrough, *SimAirport* offers significant replayability. The variety of situations, such as different airport sizes, flight routes, and unique obstacles (weather, strikes, etc.), ensures no two games will be the same.

[h2]Criticism[/h2]  
- **Complexity**: The learning curve can be steep for newcomers, especially when managing staff, security, and the ever-growing demands of passengers.
- **Repetitive**: While there’s a lot to manage, the gameplay can feel a bit repetitive after a while, especially in longer sessions.
- **Lack of detailed tutorials**: The game leaves a lot of learning to trial and error, which can be frustrating for players looking for guidance.

[h2]Funny Notes[/h2]  
- “That awkward moment when your airport becomes a maze and passengers start camping in the bathroom.”
- “Who needs a flight schedule when you have ‘creative delays’?”
- “Accidentally blocked the runway with baggage carts. Took 10 minutes for the plane to finally take off. Worth it, though.”

[h2]Rating[/h2]  
⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)  
*""SimAirport is a highly addictive and often frustrating game that challenges you to manage every aspect of an airport. The steep learning curve may put off some, but the deep strategic gameplay more than makes up for it. Just don't expect to get much done on your own flights.""*
 | this game is so funny but watch out for stuff like unsecure base"
76561198032898393,598810,Carcassonne - Tiles & Tactics,0.8666666666666667,"Casual, Strategy",0,"If you're going to play against the AI, it doesn't take advantage of fields very much. You can really cheese out some victories by dropping down some meeple to snatch up a good 30-50 additional points that way, which more often than not ends up being the deciding factor in the game. (Much like in the real life board game.)

That said, I own multiple versions of this game, to include the IRL version. One thing that kind of irks me that this game doesn't do is allow for multiple base sets to be played for a longer game. Laying down a colossal amount of tiles for a long-play has always felt part and parcel with Carcassonne (especially IRL), and that experience is missing from this one. | It's a good game, i play it a lot with my friend but CAN YOU PLEASE UPDATE IT, IT'S BUGGY AS HELL! | Great strategy game that is more complex than it first appears. The skill parts of the game involve thinking about how to use the puzzle pieces in ways that help you score points but also make your opponents castles difficult to finish. Playing against all humans in person is much more fun than a computer game cause when you pull that killer tile against your buddies and know exactly where to place it for full advantage...it is very satisfying when a good plan comes together!  If you like Catan but get 2D12 dice fatigue, this game is perfect. No Dice in Carcasonne means less luck and more skill. Also, i highly recommend the expansion packs. The basic game with the River is an ok starting point, but get the packs for variety | perfect adaptation. so much easier to keep track of scoring (especially fields) than playing the physical game | Hele leuke game, ook dat je niet alle kaarten meer op tafel hoeft te leggen en nadien weer te moeten sorteren en opbergen, bespaard veel tijd, alleen jammer dat niet alle uitbreidingen op DLC beschikbaar zijn.

76561198032898393,600480,Megaquarium,10.683333333333334,"Casual, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",4,"I did not expect this to be an 100+ hour game, just to get the achievements. After finally getting all of them it was borderline euphoric to hit the uninstall button. This game ran my life for the better part of a month and I've never been so aggressively hooked on something. 

I struggle with a lot of the larger games within this genre, such as Planet Zoo, because although I love the graphics there's a lot going on and I find it a bit overwhelming to look at. Megaquarium has basic graphics, an easy to use interface, and overall just a flatter vantage/viewpoint, which worked perfectly for me. The animals look derpy af and I love that about them.

I purchased the base game for $9 which was at least 40 hours of content and well worth it. The DLC adds a lot of complexity, especially if you're planning to go for all the achievements.  Prestige grinding can be infuriating, but once you've got a system down and properly monitor the guest comments you'll be okay. One piece of litter hidden among the masses in a high traffic area has the absolute potential to tank your aquarium reputation. 

Even if you don't want to fork out the money for the DLC packs, the base game/campaign is solid. | I loved this game due to its simplicity. I love simple simulators that also don't looks cheap. Game was simple enough but also entertaining. | Honestly, I was expecting a lot more due to the positive reviews. The idea is really nice and easily has the potential to be really good. However, a lot of older management games have more depth than this. For a much more modern game I was expecting it to be better made and have a better UI. The visitor AI is clunky and they will get themselves stuck. The graphics glitch out far too often. I've only played a few hours and already started getting bored. | A fun, cozy and surprisingly variable management sim. It does everything right in terms of game play, has a ton of variety on types of fish you can get, and more customization of habitats and guest environments than there seems on first glance (though I do wish there was more of that compared to a game like Parkitect). Workshop support is helpful for building on what's already there too. 

There are a few nits, specifically:
-Guest and employee AI is pretty weak, which makes it frustrating when fish aren't being fed in a timely and routine way and guests not being very fun to track and watch.
-The UI has something not quite right about it, like there should be a few more overlay view options and often there's an overload of open windows. Selling fish should be more intuitive than having to use the demolish button and selecting them from a tank view window.

But it's pretty minor stuff. Overall I recommend Megaquarium if you're looking to scratch that charming watch-your-project-grow itch and want to build one of those cool aquarium rooms where you walk in and are overwhelmed by the sharks and stingrays swimming all around you. | Très agréable pour ceux qui aiment construire et gérer des complexes"

Give it a try! | ゲーム自体は色んな武器、アイテムがあって、かつ爽快感があってGOOD
アバターもなんだか憎めない良い顔をしていてよきよき！

あと外国勢とマッチングになるのでラグがひどかったりもするかな？

武器はハンドガン、プラズマガン、レーザーガン、バズーカ砲、スナイプ銃など様々。

弾が切れれば、同じく取りに行かなくてはなりません。

また、ハテナブロックに触れることで使えるようになるアイテムの数もそこそこ豊富。

個人的に一番楽しいのは相手の動きを読んでの遠距離スナイプが決まった時！

リザルトをただのリザルトとして終わらせない部分はすごくすき。

To put Holodrive in perspective it is a two dimensional platformer multiplayer shooter where you play as robots with a variety of weapons. A plus is also buying the early supporter pack for the price of the base game because you get to copies of the game to so you can give one to a friend. It also gives you a ton of coins so you can get cosmetics and new weaons right off the bat like I did with the shiruken launcher. Overall, Holodrive is an amazing game, but some weapons need to be balanced a bit more like the shotgun because I can grab it and get an average of 5 kills without running out of ammo where with the rarer weapons I can only get 2 or 3 at most. This is the greatest game and everyone who dislikes it is a quitter or is just trying to play the wrong type of game that suits them. | [h1][code][list][*]本评测来自[b]BABA新游体验组[/b]，感谢组长及各位组员的努力，[url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/babagame ]鉴赏家地址[/url]

76561198032898393,603460,King and Assassins,0.55,Strategy,0,"Interesting concept.  I wouldn't make assassin able to move between guards so easily.  Although, the game says that it has a ""Single-player"" mode, it only has two stages for training only.  This is not what ""Single-player"" means.  On top of it, doing the ""training"" keeps telling me i had enough training and i should go play online and create an account which i'm somewhat ""pressured"" to do so.  I am not interested in creating an account.  I've paid for the game, i want to be able to enjoy the game and certainly do not want to receive any products publicity of any kind if this is what creating an account means.  The game would be good if we would have a single player as promise and had a lot more stages to play on as well as different difficulties (more assassins for instance, use a citizen to make believe he is bad...get some ideas there)... Also, a camera rotation would be better; Top view isn't the best but side view doesn't allow us to see the square behind a building.  

Someone said the game was bland, maybe this is what it is.  To give an example, 20 some years ago someone came in Starcraft and created a Cat-Mice game, then someone else  made it Cat-Mice-Flea game... then a lot of other people came and added variation....I took the map and i've added all the units working out all the units damage, health etc...made it impossible to edit, use cheats, gave 3 cats if there was only one cat player, mice could make svc...etc  we could play for an hour in a full 7 players game because it was balanced.

Yes, it doesn't have the features that many of the Paradox games or its sequel (Age of History 3) do. Yes, it has bugs and exploits that probably will never be fixed. But its appeal lies in its simplicity. It's so easy to learn even someone like me who struggles to learn civ6 or vic2 can play.

The game is extremely customizable. There are many scenarios, some good (World War II, modern world, 1440, haven't tried them all) and some bad (Football War, Second Boer War). There are plenty of mods which add more nations and scenarios and there is a scenario and civilization editor, although I can't say much about because I haven't really tried it.

To expand on the exploits part, as another user mentioned, you can get any nation to declare war on any other nation by going to trade request and pressing declare war on the right side of the trade (not even any gold required).

Overall, I would highly recommend this game, especially if you can snatch it on sale for like a dollar, which is well worth it for hours of fun.

Edit: There's no mac support which is unfortunate but you can use wine | Gra bardzo prosta lecz wciągająca, jest wiele scenariuszy które możemy wybrać | Great game especially if you like strategy based games and more modern war games its fun for beginers but also you can crank up the difficulty and make it also hard i would say one of the best modern war games out there this is prob better then age of history 3 | Choć gra oferuje ogromną swobodę w tworzeniu alternatywnej historii, jej interfejs jest przestarzały, a mechaniki – powtarzalne i nie do końca zbalansowane."

76561198032898393,646570,Slay the Spire,30.783333333333335,"Indie, Strategy",12,"My first 500 hours in Slay the Spire were hours I didn't pay for. 

I was a kid in highschool, broke, there was only 3 characters in the game, Vine was alive and Tiktok had yet to really get a foothold in the world. It was a better time.

And I... sailed the seas. Its not something I'm ashamed of, and if you are down on your luck, still a kid, or just don't feel like jockeying the Steam refund policy to see if you like a game, most game devs would prefer thats how you play their game over buying a copy of dubious origin from a reseller. 

Why even bring this up, you might ask? Well, it was only last year that I realized how much had gone into the game, and that there was a 4th character that I had no clue even existed. And, against my better judgement with regards to my ever disappearing free time, I picked up STS again to try that 4th character. And then I started playing the other characters too. And then I started ascension runs. 

Never in all my days have I encountered such a well crafted deckbuilder. Being singleplayer, STS doesn't care if you find a combo that breaks the game and makes the enemy unable to interact with you. Slay the Spire doesn't try and limit your ceiling, it dares you to go infinite, it [i] wants [/i] you to go infinite. My favorite part of the game is how it encourages offense while putting more than enough wrinkles in your path that you can't just go full zerg rush. Fully indexing into any one thing without accounting for the counters puts you on the path to losing. 

Learning the Watcher, the illusive 4th character I didn't know existed as it got added after I put my 500 [strike] pirated [/strike] pre-purchase hours in has been one of the most enjoyable deckbuilding experiences I've had since... well since I played STS the first time. 

The main thing I was trying to do on the Watcher that was so fun was going infinite. There was a really interesting play pattern you can take where you reset a lot and chop your deck down to like 3 powers and then your 2 card combo that goes until you win. The fun part is that by taking your deck down to so few cards, any enemy that adds cards to your deck in any way is immediately the most threatening thing you could encounter. You also have to make illogical decisions in order to get to infinite. You skip like 90% of cards you are offered, you make sacrifices for some things that would never make sense in a normal run. And that is just ONE way to play the game on one character, completely ignoring everything that comes with ascension runs. 

And all of that is also completely ignoring everything that isn't purely gameplay. The art is amazing, the soundtrack is amazing, the sound DESIGN is amazing, and there has never been a better time to get into Slay the Spire because there is a sequel that looks like its amping up everything about the first game and giving more of what is undeniably one of the grandpappys of indie roguelikes. That would've been a silly statement 10 years ago, but there are so many indie roguelikes now that it can be hard to stand out among them. 

Slay the Spire has stood the test of time and remains at the top of the tower. Play this game, and if you can, uh, pay for it while you're at it... I did. Eventually.

前几日冬促，购买了《杀戮尖塔》这款游戏，在玩之前心里曾想：我玩过那么多个3A大作，怎能会被一个小小的卡牌游戏震撼呢？看着steam好评如潮的评价，心里抱着不理解和尝试的态度，还是打开了游戏。

没错，我摊牌了，我彻底被这个游戏折服，从买完游戏到现在我无时不刻都在玩，目前也差不多一百小时了，如此优秀的游戏玩法和质量已经能超越很多3A大作。

再玩之前，我也确实久仰杀戮尖塔在卡牌肉鸽当中的地位，但是我也确实从来没玩过卡牌肉鸽，《杀戮尖塔》也属于我在肉鸽类游戏中的白月光了吧。确实只有在实际上手之后才能感受到其中的魅力。从最开始的重开在商店里找好遗物，到现在稍微有些对删牌过卡的理解，这种不完全依赖随机而是能够在游戏局内运营、构筑卡牌的机制正是它的魅力所在。同时四个角色特色迥异，相同角色又因为不同的牌组构筑有着不同的打法，再加上几乎毫无门槛的操作，在roguelike游戏的重开-学习的过程中，低挫败感、高成就感、对卡牌的熟悉以及逐渐对角色的理解使得游戏过程不像通常的卡牌roguelike，而更加有趣，能取舍是否该拿牌、是否该移除卡牌、接下来又该怎么构筑，这使该游戏的可重复游玩性大大增加。


前些天终于用战士，猎人和鸡煲把心脏打通关了，也算是对这游戏有些浅薄的理解了

开始玩这游戏的时候，好哥们建议我先玩鸡煲，说是鸡煲转起来特别强，而我也感受到了。

后来哥们和我说，玩战士得学会烧牌，我很诧异，明明每张牌都是我精挑细选的，为什么要把他们烧掉呢？后面理解了，把效率低的卡烧掉后，留下单卡效率最高的卡，打怪效率更高。之后喜欢上了烧牌的感觉，尤其很喜欢腐化，当把其他牌烧干净后，只剩下那几张攻击牌，颇有种破釜沉舟的感觉，就算打不过再sl嘛，把不该烧的牌留下来。

当我研究战士烧牌的时候，我认为战士是一个最需要想象力的职业，玩的时候得靠想象力。

关于杀戮尖塔的赞美太多太多了，我不想去赞美游戏的本身。我印象最深刻的一局是战士第一次打败心脏，因为卡组不太好，强度不高。我腐化黑拥SL一个小时二十次，结局依旧是输。我相信我能赢，我把29张牌牌序列出来，腐化黑拥烧完不同的牌牌序列出来，一个小时后我终于找到了那个解，最后我赢了之后长舒一口气。在那一刻我赢了游戏，在那一刻也赢了时间。或许一个小时我重开一局选牌好早赢了，可是能赢的局我不愿认输。


即使最后我们都会输给时间，这没关系，那也要谱写出每个人自己生命的赞歌。什么是生命的赞歌？或许是藏在人们骨子里的永不屈服、永不妥协、永不认输。

我的人生没办法sl，为了战胜这一路上的小怪，烧过那么多休息牌，娱乐牌，还换了那么多血，这是否真的值得？可惜这个问题的答案没法通过sl去知道了。
现在的我，就想赶快走到下一个篝火休息。人生啊，总是奔向下一个篝火，区别是以前的我会在篝火敲牌，以后我只会休息了。

最后感谢《杀戮尖塔》给我带来一百小时的快乐时光，我现在唯一后悔的就是在大学期末考试期间购买了这款游戏，这游戏真的有瘾啊！😭 | 又开始带鸡煲节奏了我真是服了😅鸡煲是这个游戏唯一的完美职业，已经和尖塔融为一体，成了尖塔的底层逻辑，成名绝技偏差认知给尖塔带来了这个贴吧最经典的话题，创造了尖塔的黄金时代，诋毁鸡煲，你想毁了杀戮尖塔吗？
 | Dangerous dangerous game, whether you are playing it on the go via tablet or have it on steam maybe with mods as well, if this is the right game for you your free time will evaporate. If you like deckbuilding, pve strategy and the like, this is just perfect. If you've got a background in competitive/multiplayer collectable card games, the pve nature of slay the spire enabling you to do some truly unbalanced things will make you ecstatic

If you're thinking of ""why bother getting this game when Slay the Spire 2 is going to come out soon?"", well this is already one of the best games of all time, don't be silly. | 仅仅是打了个全成就 ，仍然无法全面的评价这个游戏。因为这100个小时里仅仅专精了猎人，还有三个职业只是简单玩了玩。
真的有点惊叹于游戏的设计，仅仅四个角色，仅仅三个区域（算上心脏四个）却可以让一个游戏有着如此大的可玩性。看似重复的遭遇和地图，随着局内带来的各种惊喜（多种多样的道具，卡组搭配，药水选择，随机事件等）和精妙的设计（数值的平衡和关卡的平衡）可以说再玩几百个小时都不会觉得腻。而且这还是我没去更深体验其他三个角色和增加可玩性的mod时的想法。
体验下来确实可以说无与伦比，极其出色的游戏（又到幸运时刻了，今年出2！）"

it isn't without it's flaws, namely,

1. In the career mode your match-performance is insignificant and inconsequential to the skill pints provided after match, you can score a century or have a fifer, but only get the same amount of skill pints even if u sim the entire game or score ""ZERO"", this really sucker punches the motivation.

Going to try the next installment because the first game was very enjoyable. | Если играли в We Were Here, то уже знаете, чего ожидать от игры. Простой игровой процесс с головоломками, которые максимально напрягут ваш мозг. Общение и совместная работа - единственный способ пройти игру.

Эту часть максимальный акцент сделали на описании прямо вот мельчайший деталей. Вы будете ОЧЕНЬ много говорить и скорее всего даже кричать. Не будет ни малейшего понятия, что именно видит другой человек. Таким образом, необходимо быть настолько изобретательным и тщательным в описании вашего окружения, насколько это вообще возможно. Крайне важно найти общий язык с вашим корешом. Иногда правильное действие определяется мельчайшими деталями, поэтому будьте готовы повторять вещи и убедитесь, что ваш тиммейт вас точно хорошо понял. Ну и так же головоломки на время, в которых один из вас может сгореть в какой нибудь лаве или еще куда нибудь упасть.

После того, как прошли игру, можно попробовать поменяться местами, чтобы увидеть, что ваш тиммейт видел раньше, а так же выбить недостающие ачивки. Но самое интересное, что второе прохождение, даже с тем что вы поменяетесь местами, займет до часу+-. Так же существует «секретная» концовка, которую я лично и не понял, потому что по итогу там все так же, как и в обычной. Игра пытается иметь какую то историю, в основном это загадочная, скрытная, потому что каждая часть игры проходит в каком то замке. Просто немного жуткая и не представляет собой ничего большего.

Довольная короткая часть и похожа максимально на предыдущую, только более интересными головоломками, но по времени все так же. Но в любом случае если вам нравятся логические головоломки и есть с кем играть, We Were Here Too это та самая игра и франчиза. Это одна из тех инди-игр, бюджет которой можно определить, просто взглянув на нее. Тем не менее, она убедительно доносит свою идею. Если все равно как то сомневаетесь, есть все так же бесплатная часть, чтобы понять, нравится ли вам подобное. Вдобавок ко всему, We Were Here Too стоит по скидке, как бутылка пива, по этому вижу здесь лишь одни плюсы.

76561198032898393,684040,Logos,0.55,"Simulation, Strategy",0,"As an idea, the game is good. It seems to work, as far as I played it. Graphics are simple but functional, music doesnt bother me, but doesnt mean much either.

What annoys me is the propaganda. Yes, its based in New Age idea of souls learning for lifetimes and traveling through ages and galaxies, Im OK with that. Its got elements and elemental balance and thats ok, its good for a human to be in balance.

The game has things like, vegetarianism and eating meat, plant and fur clothing. Important stuff it seems. As important  as fire, and almost as important as zombies. Now, I try to eat my greens for health and avoid eating animals for moral reasons, not perfect but more dedicated than most, and I understand those are Good Causes. I can accept people tell me those are good causes. What does not go well with me is the way the game punishes you if your pre-stone age people add protein to their diet or wear clothes that actually protect them in the winter. In modern age, we dont need to kill animals to survive, and Im all for that. But if the game tells me, eating meat and wearing fur is bad for stone age or pre-stone age people, you can all just kiss my nether places.
You dont get your calories, you die. You try wearing a fig leaf in a snow storm in the Ice Age, you die. 
It really pisses me off. If the choices were at least equal, it wouldnt, but in this game, meat is simply a bad move and veggies are purely good.
Studies showed that increased calorie and proteine intake caused by eating meat was what made growth of human brain possible. Increased brain size led to more and more varied diet. These are GOOD things.
Really, I feel my values being mocked. There are real, sensible, rational reasons for vegetarianism, and ethical = scientifically explainable reasons for not eating meat/kindness to animals. There are even psychological benefits for spirituality but this game just turns it into pseudo-religious good is good because is good whoohaw and tries to ram it down your throat like a catholic priest.

Something good at least comes out of this, I get a baconburger, my GF gets a furcoat and hopefully that gets me a lot of
very non-spiritual carnal playtime as I try to distance myself from this so called... game. | A relaxing take on the concept of god games.

In a way, it's quite like a version of civilization abstracted to the max and totally rid of the micromanagement.

Gameplay is quite simple, each turn you choose one developpement card (material or spiritual) for humanity about 4 possible ones, trying to keep balances and avoid desasters.

Beware of Aliens and Zombies, they just cause trouble ! | For me, it is a fair game, but I would not recommend it to anyone else.   It is a deeply strange game.  I like that.  

You play a god or alien overlord of a new planet. Your goal is to protect and nurture humans along their journey. It is card driven. You draw four cards each round and have to play one. The cards have one time or continuous impact on the planet.

There are not many games like it, and I like that. Probably the closest comparable games are Reign or Fate of the World. Like Reign, your first playthroughs you really don't know what the threats are and you will fail. 

Why don't I recommend it? 
First, it is clearly early access. Graphics are bad, UI is not very logical and there is not enough in-game information for a new player.  It will probably get better. 

Second, more disturbingly, I feel like I am playing a cult initiation tool. There are a ton of strange design choices that speak to the developers' philosophy and if I scrutinize them too closely they give me the creeps.   I think for most people that would be a turn-off, but I actually find it kind of cool. The game evoked a response from me that most games don't. | An unusual take on god games.  I think you need to have your tinfoil hat stapled to your head, because it is conspiracy theory central.  Medicine often decreases health.  Providing a clean water supply often drops population.  Wild animals periodically group together to attack the human population, and aliens are insistently trying to colonise Earth every couple of years.  In short, this is a game written by some folks who just aren't taking their meds.  This game is also quite cheap, and gameplay is compulsive, with everything being a constant jumble of off-setting variables against a random card draw mechanic.  There is no guide to the combat system, which is also hilariously cumbersome, and you will probably wind up fighting aliens with bows and arrows at some point.  Get ready to march humanity to extinction... because you are the Logos. 


 | This game is awesome! I really like this fresh and new take on the strategy game format. 
The game is very complex, and highly addictive. 
You play as a godlike entity (the ""main logos"") of the Earth, and your goal is to help mankind thru history. 
There's a good spiritual message in the game, that you should care about one another, 
take care of the environment, look things in another perspective, and make hard, sometimes questionable decisions for the greater good. It's not easy, you need to pay attention to a lot of variables (population, echology, etc.) otherwise you will fail very quickly. 
If you like a game, that is challenging, thought-provoking and puts you on the edge through, 
than I highly reccomend it to you. 
I would love to see more games like this. :)"

游戏通关时间不长，打得快几小时能通关，玩了挺久其中有部分时间是挂机，全成就不太难，大概10到20小时就可以全成就，游戏玩起来有个8分水平，但是全成就有一个需要杀15000个维京人，这种比较浪费时间的刷怪类成就降0.5分到7.5分吧。回到游戏本身，游戏的上限不高，内容体量不多，通过多次游玩解锁部分肉鸽内容，前10小时游玩体验还是挺有趣的，后面我是摸鱼或者健身踩椭圆仪的时候玩，游戏挺适合摸鱼的时候打几关，游戏可以设置平板模式，用平板远程电脑可以无障碍地游玩，游戏主要难度在如何度过前期，前期打好了运用兵种克制后面基本能无敌过。游玩建议开启重玩关卡选项，如果策略失误还能重打不至于坏档。

[h2]游戏的小缺点[/h2]
1，游戏的策略性有限，前期游玩有趣，玩到后面就比较重复，做了肉鸽的内容，但是随机性和兵种构建深度不够，容易玩到后面比较腻。
2，困难难度到后期的难度主要是巨人弓箭手和多波敌人一起出现，所以如果前期部队构建不好，没有多个盾+弓手的构建容易崩盘，不能洗兵种加上装备装上了就不能够脱下，容易让人前期没搭配好，后期崩盘会很难受。

总的来说，游戏整体来说还是挺好玩的，价格便宜，带有一定的策略性，美术和音乐也挺有意思，如果对这类游戏感兴趣的可以打折购入玩玩，属于挺有意思的策略布防小游戏。

The clean visuals and relaxing music contrast with the intense Viking invasions.Easy to learn but challenging to master, it’s a must play for strategy fans! | I have completed the game twice on normal and hard difficulty. The game is minimalistic as you must have seen but I feel this also becomes one of its weakness. I had fun playing this game and here are some point I would like to highlight about the game:

-> Always keep ""Allow level restart"" active otherwise 1 mistake can destroy hefty progress, sometime it will be the fighter AI mistake and not even yours.
-> This game could have had a better Codex or an info panel current one is not that good (some flash games have better codex that this).
-> Even though the game may look minimalistic and easy to play it is not, if you are planning to complete the game that is. Once you are in the latter half of the game you will need to use the skills to make meaningful progress which is not bad in itself but because how the game is designed most waves of enemies board the island at the exact same time so will have to use skills to ambush them at the same time which is very hard in practice, max I could do successfully was 2.
-> BRUTE ARCHERS !!! Hate these guys, they have arrow and force comparable to ballista while being wielded by one of the highest HP enemy, have the maximum range than any other troop even hugely more than our own max archers, so much so that you would be busy in a fight and their arrow will come like a sniper shot and decimate your helpless troops. On top of all that there is no commander you can have that will properly counter them, shield-men comes as the best answer for them but even they can sometime die to their arrow idk how.
-> Game AI or basically the targeting and fighting of the enemy and friendly troops, its doesn't work that well, especially when against enemy ranged troops. Your melee troops will just stand and die even if the enemy is less than 1 tile away, while shield-men are very homing which sometimes results in them breaking your formation.
-> After these 2 play-throughs on both difficulty I don't feel like playing the game again, so not very replayable. There isnt a lot of combinations or creative and fun ways to play this game because of the limitation of only 3 types of troops and every enemy only having a specific troop to counter them.

Even though I have highlighted mostly negative point I still had fun playing this game, its just that some problems have very obvious solution which could have been implemented or kept when making the game from ground up."
76561198032898393,690040,SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE,0.0,"Action, Indie",0,"It's a rouge-like now for some reason. Instead of a unique map for each level with predictable spawns and weapons, everything is now random. It reduces repetition fatigue while gutting the puzzle solving aspects, it's necessary given how much repetition MCD has. It also makes it more punishing, as enemies can unpredictably spawn behind you with no audio cue. It isn't unfair per say, but MCD asks a lot more of the player than the first game, too much in my opinion. When you've mastered the game enough to beat it, you'll already be bored. The new weapons, exploding and red gunned enemies are nice additions. The bosses, 90% immune enemies and nerf to melee weapons are bad additions, since they restrict movement. The rouge-like upgrades (hacks) are just simple buffs to the weapons or your person, they don't encourage different play. There isn't enough depth for synergy to be possible.

Tying this together is a story that thinks it's good enough to harm the game-play, when it isn't good enough to even be told. If Super Hot's story was a boring premise with an obnoxious but interesting delivery, then MCD is the same boring premise with “a do it yourself” delivery because they couldn't be bothered… but more obnoxious. Having to wait 2.5 hours in game on a loading screen isn't clever writing, it's a bitcoin mining scam.

новые типы врагов, ловушки, элементы рогалика, боссы (неубиваемые челы со способностям) - это все в игру привнесло не только разнообразия, но и челенжа которого мне так не хватало в первой части. в ней для меня самым сложным при прохождении на 100% было не заскучать проходя N испытаний, в которых одни и те же уровни с каким-то минимальным отличием и то до этого можно не дойти, тк это не часть основного сюжета. тут же сложность как будто растет по ходу всей игры, это круто мне реально было сложно и я застревал на некоторых уровнях

но есть одна проблема, которая появилась из за внесения в игру элементов рогалика. я в целом люблю рогалики, но проблема в том что в суперхоте не так много билдов которые ты можешь собрать и со временем ты перестаешь открывать новые перки а уровни становятся все сложнее и ты начинаешь душиться из за сложности и отсутствия развития в механиках. да и в рогаликах обычно ты пытаешься собрать что то имбовое, но тут нельзя собрать что то прям мощное, все равно БОЛЬШАЯ часть успеха в прохождении будет оставаться на твоих действиях и скилле, хоть перки и упрощают игровой процесс. короче говоря я задушился, а когда мне сказали в конце игры без перков и классов проходить уровень с 15 этапами я просто выключил, пока не готов к этому.

еще из того что понравилось, в прошлой части немалый акцент был на сюжет и круто что в этой части его почти нет и больше упор на геймплей. сюжет в первой части был интересный но очев что все идут в эту игру за геймплеем, и в сиквеле разрабы как бы говорят ""да, мы понимаем зачем вы сюда зашли, держите то что вам нужно""

как все тут пишут да и сама игра твердит, эта часть понравится тем кому нужно БОЛЬШЕ и кому не хватило прошлой части. я в целом удовлетворен, но в конце задушился. | Just as fun as the first game, if not more so. New enemy types, new weapons, new abilities, and a solid roguelike feel that's challenging without being outright punishing. | ██▓▒­░⡷⠂𝚆𝙴 𝙽𝙴𝙴𝙳 𝙼𝙾𝚁𝙴⠐⢾░▒▓██ | O jogo é uma boa sequência do primeiro, com novas mecânicas de poderes e uma dificuldade superior ao primeiro, porém de acordo com o tempo jogado passa a ser um pouco repetitivo, o jogo tem muitas fases, repetindo várias vezes o mesmo mapa. O jogo tenta contar a história de um jeito não convencional, muito estranho na verdade, mais não é tão ruim. A sensação de matar os inimigos é ainda mais satisfatória que no primeiro jogo, há mais variedades de armas também, o que deixa tudo mais divertido, portanto em questão de gameplay ele supera o primeiro jogo.

Apesar da experiência ser meio repetitiva após um tempo, ainda é um bom jogo. Recomendo pegar se você gostou do primeiro jogo, caso não tenha jogado, jogue o primeiro antes desse."

It has been 30min and all I did was sit in the Visitor Camera and got a Tour of my own Zoo, very therapeutic. Would recomend | I recommend only for the base game, since the dlc seems like the same as base game mechanically but with more animals variants, so I will not buy one.

I hope hope hope they can one day release an aquarium DLC for us. Many zoos and zoos and aquariums and the player base is ready for the challenge in what I've seen. | Probably one of my all time favorite games - if it even counts as a game. There is a bit of a learning curve, so new players will probably be a bit overwhelmed simply from creative possibilities when they first start out. Take it slow and embrace ""mistakes"" as even real life zoos have quirks and imperfections. As for overall play, I've ended up with pretty much every DLC simply because it's kinda fun having different animals out doing their own thing, especially for those of us that blend ""realistic"" with ""this zoo has literally everything."" If you're the creative type that likes ""figuring things out,"" having the occasional distraction watching animals frolicking about, and have a lot of extra time to really obsess over details, this is the perfect game."

And that's the problem with the review system here.

This game will be good for a specific subset of gamers.
You have to be okay with a UI that is barely on the side of functional.
You have to be okay with graphics that were made obsolete after windows 3.11.
You have to *actively enjoy* numbers, incremental gameplay and having your mistakes punished.

If this isn't you, look somewhere else, for all our sakes.

The gameplay is deep. Imagine Frostpunk, with terrible graphics but better gameplay and more options.
It's what you might get if Bay 12 made dwarf fortress with an actual UI (in the very early stages at least)
And most importantly, to me at least, the developer pays attention to the users, the people who enjoy their game, and implements their changes with a good turnaround speed.

So this is a 'qualified recomment' from me. | IMPORTANT UPDATE:  Tormunda's health issues no longer allow him to be a Dev.  The game is complete for what was originally intended but the added content Tormunda was working on may never be finished.  The game should still work well for most and has a great community but is no longer supported.  The following review is based on the original game, not the added content.

I love this game.  It's far better than it first appears and it grows on you.  This is a game that you will really love, or isn't for you at all.  There may not be a middle ground and graphics may be the line in the sand.  I delayed reviewing it for quite some time, trying to separate what makes Settlements great from why it won't be right for others.  In a nutshell it's a unique hybrid game so the potential is there for many to enjoy it.  RPG gamers, strategists, and city builders may all find a home here.  If you are too focused in any one direction you may want to look closely at the details to see if it's for you.

IT MAY BE A GREAT GAME FOR YOU IF...
------------------------------------------------------------
Many that have enjoyed pen and paper games will like Settlements, particularly if you are interested in strategy and RPG.  City builders will also find this game enchanting, particularly if the difficulty settings are adjusted toward easier so that combat is less of a factor.  If you are looking for a game that puts all these aspects together then you came to the right place.

Those that love it have a hard time setting it down.  It's addictive.  If you are someone that fits these criteria this is a game you should check out.  It may not be clear before playing a little bit but this game has that ""just a little bit longer"" factor in spades.

IT MAY NOT BE THE GAME FOR YOU IF...
-----------------------------------------------------------
Graphics and motion are a clear line in the sand for most that don't enjoy this game.  The graphics are not pixel blurry or bad.  They are quite clear and pleasant.  They don't ""move"" though.  This isn't an action game and it doesn't have arcade motion.  Much like an advanced board game there are many icons.  The icons are more advanced than a board game could provide.  There are moving progress bars, changing numbers, and even some changes to the looks of some icons (depicting changes in gear and health status).  You see spreadsheet levels of information but in a more graphic form.  This can be off putting for both those that strongly like traditional spreadsheets or for those that don't like them at all.   For those remaining, the result is more immersive.  It just won't work for everyone.

IT""S A TURN BASED GAME WITHOUT TURNS
----------------------------------------------------------------
At it's core it's a simulation.  Time moves freely forward with everything all happening at once.  Only combat is outside of the normal time line.  Time moves in increments of twenty minutes and can be paused at any time.  Scouts and salvaging teams complete missions measured in hours while progress bars measure crafting each twenty minute tick.  The ticks give a feeling of ""turns"" within the simulation.  Combat IS turn based with an initiative system.

COMBAT
------------
Combat uses a system much like many pen and paper RPG's without the micro management of using miniatures.  The tactics available are simple but deeper than many notice for quite some time.  Threat, leadership, combat healing, front/back row positioning, and stances all come into play as well as gear, initiative, and combat abilities.  It moves quickly despite being turn based.

MICRO MANAGEMENT OR NOT...
-----------------------------------------------
The OCD inclined will be compelled to micro manage the crap out of this game.  On the surface the game appears to lean heavily this way.  This is a deception.  The game is amazingly robust without micro managing.  The pace of the game actually moves according to factors within your control.  The Dev has placed many tips within the game so as you get to know the game you can be macro wasteful or micro OCD to your hearts content.

CHAOS VERSUS ORDER
-----------------------------------
You can also lean more toward combat and RPG or focus more on city management and get two very different flavors from the game.  This can be accomplished both through difficulty settings when you set up the game as well as by your personal play style in game.

REPLAYABILITY
----------------------
Most games with an RPG plot don't have high replayability.  Once you know, ""the butler did it"" the RPG is usually gone.  I'm one of those people that only ""once throughs"" RPG's, even when there are many different characters that could be played.

This game might be different though.  It's more along the line of games where you know there is something bad out there against you, you just don't know the specifics (similar to AI War in this regard).  Even once you know, there is still a malevolent force against you.  RPG mystery solved but can you win?

The game might be worth it even if it was just for ""once through.""  It's not short.  It also has more than one ending.  Those in it purely for the RPG are already used to ""once through'ing"" most games.  This one won't cheat you...HOWEVER...

...Settlements has a much higher degree of replayability than a typical RPG due it's hybrid nature, specifically city building.  It's got character development and a sandbox feel that goes beyond the story.  I've found each play through to be very different simply based on the differences in the families you start with.  The differences lead to doing things in different ways that create more differences the farther you proceed.  What worked well one game won't work so well the next time.  I found myself looking forward to the next start.  This game is fun to replay!  Those that like to restart games a lot just to play the different starts will be happy.  Those looking to do things one way still have the opportunity to do so by controling the pace of the game too.  They might not move forward as quickly but both options work well.

THE DEV
-------------
UPDATE:  Tormunda is a great Dev.  I had many good things to say about him in this section but he is no longer available.

BOTTOM LINE
--------------------
For those that like city building, strategy, and RPG elements this game is refreshingly different.  Anyone looking for a combat game, or strictly RPG, or any one genre by itself is likely to be disappointed but the combination works.  You get your money's worth and more.

It's casual in the way city builders are.  You can play for a few minutes and easily pick up where you left off.  I don't play puzzle games but each play through has an element much like a puzzle, trying to find the best way through.  It's hard to set down.

The game was stable, playable, and fun for months throughout early access.  I saw how Tormunda operates over that whole time so I can say with confidence that he will be an active Dev post launch too.  I sound like a paid advertisement by this point but I did also warn those whom it might not suit.  =)   I didn't know what to expect when I picked up the game but I am a fan now.  I also know Tormunda has plans for the game post launch...

Update:  I've heard enough confusion about some aspects of how to get started that you might need strong problem solving skills to get rolling.  Think outside the box...and ask the community.  Those that may still be around are very helpful.  The game works but not everything is intuitive. | ８月１０日追記：

あとテストプレイヤーに立候補したら名前が赤くなりましたが開発さんとは無関係です。
今もテスト版のプレイヤーさんを募集していますので興味がある方は是非。


外国人の方々のレビューを見ていて、長時間プレイしてる方が多く評価も良かったので興味はありましたがいかんせん見た目が地味なのでなかなか手を出してませんでした。
実際にプレイしてみると予想以上の時間泥棒ゲーでした。

ちまちまと材料を集めたり生産したりしながら文明を発展させていくプレイ感は作業ゲー好きにはたまらないものがあります。
プレイしたものの中でいうとtheas: the awakeningとか犬と猫ゲーに近い。
アクション要素は皆無でひたすらクリックアンドドロップで新しいアイテムや建物をアンロックしたり建築したり、スカウトをクエストに送り込み探索やボスを倒すことでレアアイテムをゲットしながら拡張していくゲームです。マネジメント要素が強くシティビルダーとしての要素はほぼないです。
この手のゲーム好きな方には建物やアイテムの種類が揃っているかが重要だと思いますが、現時点でもかなりの種類が用意されていると思います。
時代が進むごとに要求される物が変わっていき、少しづつ設備や装備を整えながら新しいアイテムを開発していきます。
クリア条件も何種類か用意されている模様。

更に特筆すべきは開発さん。個人でやってるのか知らないけどやたら熱心です。
あれ、これバグ？と思ってフォーラムに投稿したら、2、3時間放置してる間に開発の方から返信が3件くらい来てました。なんという暇じ・・・じゃなくて熱心な開発なんだろうとここでまず感心です。
セーブを送ってくれというので送ったら速攻で調べるね！という旨の返信がきて、その後またすぐにその結果を送ってくれました。
結果は半分私の勘違いだったのですが、バグの部分は次の日か２日後くらいにはパッチで直してくれました。
小さなパッチも含めて週に何回かはアップデートが入っていると思います。
正式バージョンとベータ版があり、小さなバグはありますが修正も早く積極的にプレイヤーのアイディアを取り入れているようなので、アーリーアクセスなりの楽しみ方も出来ると思います。

英語は多少は読みますが、ストーリーを楽しむタイプのゲームではない為流れがわかればほぼ必要ないと思います。

全国の作業ゲー好きの皆さまに是非チェックして頂きたい作品です。


８月５日追記：
アーリーアクセス抜けました。今後も開発を続けていくとのこと。全国のアーリーアクセス売り逃げ詐欺にあったsteamerの皆さん！！Tormunda先生はきっと裏切りません。



↓以下わかりにくそうなとこをちょっと書いておきますので試行錯誤したい方はみないでね。

[spoiler]
Doomsday Status- 戦闘で負けたり逃げたりすると少しづつ増えていく。family under attackのクエストなどで少しづつ下がる。満タンになるとたぶんやばい。
Science lab- 人員を配置し食べ物を補充し、研究したい項目をスライドするとレシピなどが増える。ちなみに科学者は同じsettlementにいなくても働かせられます。
Era- そのまんま時代。次の時代の建物を建設すると次の時代に進み、新しい研究がアンロックされる。同じeraに居続けても特にデメリットはない模様。
Oil Pump- 建物立てれないゾーン。人員配置のみ。
Greenprints- ゲームが進むと工場を建てられますが、crafterでfactory-onにすると工場用のレシピが開発されます。レシピは少しづつ改善でき、一定の確立で良いアイテムが作成出来たり一度に複数のアイテムを作成できます。

[/spoiler] | Management sims aren’t really expected to have the best user interfaces in the world, and that’s always surprised me. After all, you’re spending more time with the UI in games like these than almost any other, scrutinizing resource charts or assigning groups to tasks. Somehow really clunky and awkward interfaces still get a pass, as long as the core simulation is good, and Settlements is one of those titles that really puts that notion to the test. It’s a clever, creative game with incredible depth, all hidden within a UI pulled straight from Windows 3.1. And if the first part of that sentence matters a lot more than the second, you’ve got dozens of hours of adventures and challenges ahead of you.

You’ll be unsurprised to learn the world has ended again, and while the means aren’t specified up front the ends certainly are. This brave new world is covered in a thick layer of tough brambles, rendering the land uninhabitable save for small clearings amongst the vines and thorns. It’s in these pockets that you must foster your titular settlements, building homes and workshops, tasking your people with construction and research, and eventually forging back out into the world to find more clearings, survivors, and answers. As you recover the technological progress of the past you’ll also learn the truth of what brought the old world to its knees, and contend with that same threat yet again.

You might have visions of Banished or Rust floating through your head from that but Settlements is a purely menu-driven simulation, right down to some unexpected restrictions. For starters, each of your settlements can only contain six buildings. This is constant throughout the game, and provides the main impetus to expand to additional settlements. At least two of those precious slots always needs to go to houses as well, leaving just four for your resource gathering and crafting and such. All resources are shared across your settlements, at least, and while residents don’t transfer between them for work they can all be used to scout or battle or adventure when the opportunities present themselves.

Settlement management is fairly straight-forward, with resources to turn into items or research and upgrades to buildings and defenses as you tech up. To find new settlements and advance the plot, though, you’ll need to send your people scouting. Based on their prodigious list of stats and skills they’ll have chances to make progress towards a new settlement, find treasure or optional battles, unlock new quests and mini-dungeons to explore, or get ambushed. Combat is turn-based, pitting four of your settlers against up to eight foes at a time, beasts like rats and wolves and madmen. Properly equipping your folks is the main concern, as you can often overpower enemies with preparation. Groups on both sides can include reserves that do ranged damage and can be swapped in for wounded units though, so there’s some strategy to consider in tougher battles.

Building up your settlements will advance you through ages of development, from the stone and bronze ages all the way up to and past modern tech. That means that your survivors, originally clad in furs and wielding clubs, will one day be running science centers and manning missile batteries against your foes. That assumes you can last long enough against the massing enemies that attack your settlements more and more frequently. Your failure state is a “doomsday” counter that increments with certain events and losses, and must be battled back through other actions. Still, this isn’t a pressing concern for most of the game as long as you keep your settlements developed and your people properly outfitted.

Settlements is a game of impressive scope and content, one that can easily last you dozens of hours for a single playthrough. The only problem is that it’s hidden behind one of the most hideous interfaces I have ever seen for a game. This goes far beyond programmer art or even placeholders, with inconsistent resolutions, confusing layouts, and even Windows system prompts for important notifications. There are aspects of the main interface that won’t even be used for your first dozen hours, while key information is hidden in random windows elsewhere. Your resource trackers must be manually configured, and every resident has to be manually equipped and assigned to tasks. And some windows like the task list load so slowly you can watch the contents be drawn in real-time.

It’s a testament to how engaging the gameplay is that the UI wasn’t an immediate deal-breaker for me. Game feel and quality-of-life are huge aspects of gaming for me, and everything about how Settlements is presented is an absolute affront. But it’s a very different kind of survival sim, both in structure and in plot. The revelations I’ve come across in the first ten hours or so are tantalizing, and the challenges I’ve overcome have been compelling. You’ve really got to consider how big a difference the UI in a game can make for you, but if it’s something you’re willing to be flexible on, give Settlements a try. With so much to learn, explore, and conquer, this is a title that can utterly consume your time if you let it.



Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them at https://goldplatedgames.com/ or on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/11322459/]curation page[/url]! | Es un gran juego. Detrás de su aspecto simplón, nos encontramos con un juego de estrategia en el que llevamos unos asentamientos (inicialmente 2) empezando en la edad de piedra, en un mundo distópico del que poco se sabe.

Deberemos sobrevivir mejorando nuestros asentamientos y empezando a construir nuevas herramientas, armas y edificaciones. Esto es una simplificación porque la cantidad de cosas que podemos fabricar es enorme: cascos, pieles para cubrirnos la cabeza y el cuerpo, escudos, armas de todo tipo (dos manos, a una mano, a distancia), herramientas, prendas, utensilios, etc. A medida que vamos mejorando nuestro conocimiento de las cosas que podemos fabricar el juego nos irá abriendo nuevas opciones. Cada personaje tiene unas habilidades básicas centradas en la estamina, fuerza, intelecto, destreza... Dependiendo de eso será mejor orientar a ese personaje a labores más manuales (craftear, picar piedra/madera, etc) o bien a labores más intelectuales (investigación). Cada personaje puede lograr hasta 15 habilidades adicionales a medida que va ganando experiencia en sus labores cotidianas, de manera que no sólo es un juego de supervivencia sino también una mezcla de géneros en el que encontramos rol, gestión de habilidades, gestión de recursos, exploración y combate táctico por turnos.

La exploración es muy divertida ya que podemos investigar lugares que pueden necesitar nuestra ayuda o bien buscar lugares donde encontrar recursos. Adicionalmente es la forma de conseguir nuevos asentamientos para construir más infraestructuras y que nuestra supervivencia siga mejorando. En ese entorno salvaje y desconocido irán apareciendo ""bosses"", enemigos, lugares para explorar, etc. En algunas misiones podemos combatir, en otras hay un minijuego como en los juegos antiguos de rol donde avanzamos por un mapa y vamos leyendo un texto que nos indica lo que ocurre. A lo mejor tenemos que cavar y necesitaremos a alguien que tenga esa habilidad; a veces necesitaremos un explorador o un nadador...en fin, un minijuego de rol.

El combate táctico por turnos es muy divertido. Cada personaje, en función del equipamiento que le hemos dado, tendrá más capacidad para bloquear y resistir impactos y más probabilidades para causar daño al enemigo. A medida que avanzamos algunos de nuestros hombres podrán tener habilidades de liderazgo, que permiten crear buffs en combate como por ejemplo, inspiración, formación de combate, nuevas formas de ataque, etc. También, si hemos dado vendas a alguien, podemos activar la habilidad médica que permitirá curar heridas durante el enfrentamiento. 

Durante el combate tenemos una formación de vanguardia y una de reserva. A medida que nuestra vanguardia sufre daños la podemos reemplazar por la reserva para descansar y recuperarnos de las heridas. Si estamos defendiendo el asentamiento es muy importante construir barricadas, muros, empalizadas, fosos así como reclutar milicia y otras muchas cosas.

Sinceramente, no puedo ponerme a detallar todo lo que tiene el juego porque es una locura. Tiene una profundidad enorme y el espacio que requeriría esta reseña sería demasiado largo. Lo que os estoy contando es un resumen muy rápido de lo que el juego ofrece."

I know it's got a shaky history, especially with those who were expecting Torn Banner Studios to make a ""true"" follow up to Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, but taken apart from that context, this game is, at least to me, more visually interesting, and far more enjoyable an experience. Now, it does have major issues with Ping, some graphics bugs that need to be fixed, and the Devs REALLY need to work on better server connectivity overall, but even with those issues, I feel a great fondness for Mirage.

I enjoy the intregation of combat spells, traps, and projectiles into the combat, I love the simple but fun act of parkouring up a wall to flank an opponent, and I LOVE the colors, the art style, and the map design. It's nice to see something visually different in the hack and slash action genre, and to play a game that just feels... fun. I got my butt kicked several times and still enjoyed the experience, simply because of how unabashedly silly and yet solid it felt as a whole. 

The fact that this game is being shunned, (as far as I can tell), simply because it was not what was initially expected, fills me with frustration. How many sword fighting, fireball slinging games, drenched in far Eastern, Arabian Nights psychadeIic glory, are there? Almost none. I long for warriors to return en masse to these arenas and halls and canyons. I long to wall run through the world, cutting my foes down with technicolor laser beams and cold etched steel, but there's not a soul to be found on the servers anymore. Please folks, give this game a try. It really is fantastic, and deserves better. | 首先这游戏我是三个月前预购的，当时承诺有简体中文，不得不说这个因素是我预购的一大原因，解锁之后发现这次的烟雾弹真不小，除了英文其他语言一概没有，也许制作组想用这种方式来杜绝国区的差评，但是这并不代表我就不给你差评，没有诚信的公司，只有给他合适的评价，才会让他觉醒。
说说游戏本身和孪生兄弟中世纪骑士一个玩法，就是拿着武器把敌人干倒，血肉横飞是这家公司做游戏的招牌菜。不过上市刚刚解锁就已经看出了鬼服的潜力，玩的人目前不超过100.。延迟高到你怀疑人生，读取时间长的你几乎可以睡一觉，这就是我解锁以后第一局的实际感受，买了的如果期待它以后能改好就留着，不喜欢看着不爽直接退了拉倒。

[b]Примечание: игра взята со скидкой 50%. Наиграл несколько десятков часов в ЗБТ и ОБТ.[/b]

Описывать геймплей я не буду - за меня это неплохо делают всевозможные видео и скриншоты.

Пройдемся лучше по конкретике.


[h1]Откуда такие отрицательные отзывы?[/h1]
В общем и целом, больше половины отрицательных отзывов концентрируют свое внимание на следующем:
[list]
[*] dumbed down combat (""вот в чивалри боевка была лучше, а тут два оружия, пара ударов и ненужная магия"");
[*] низкий онлайн (подробности ниже);
[*] плохая оптимизация;
[*] дисбаланс/баги.
[/list]

Пройдемся по пунктам.

[h1][i]""Вот в чивалри я всех разносил, а тут боевка тупее, ничего сделать не могу""[/i][/h1]
Эти отзывы возникают ровно по той же причине, по которой DLC к Chivalry имеют низкий онлайн - [b]здесь были поправлены  многие баги и эксплоиты[/b], которые присутствовали в оригинальной Chivalry, а именно:
[list]
[*] reverse-оверхэды (удар из-за головы при угле обзора >150 градусов, когда чувак просто наклоняется и убивает у себя за спиной);
[*] сверхчеловеческий drag (в момент удара увеличиваем сенсу и дергаем мышь, получаем моментальный слэш градусов эдак на 180-270, макрос пилится на раз-два);
[*] спам feint'ами (атаками-обманками);
[/list]

Как бы я не любил [b]Chivalry,[/b] у её фан-базы есть большая раковая опухоль - [i]больше 50% игроков играть без вышеперечисленных эксплоитов и макросов не умеют вообще[/i] - исключение составляют редкие иностранные сервера вроде Sneaky Monkeys, где таких гнобят и кикают. В результате новоприбывшие в чивалри либо сразу уходят, увидев эту клоунаду, либо гуглят гайды и начинают делать то же самое.

Здесь же это все (в бОльшей степени) исправлено, разве что драги (на мой взгляд) можно было бы еще немного ограничить по скорости. Но в целом в процессе игры у тебя практически не возникает вопросов [i]""да как так он меня убил-то? Я же заблокировал!""[/i].

В результате приличная доля фан-базы Чивалри поливает эту игру помоями, потому что без багоюза играть они не умеют. Такая вот досада.

Еще в Чивалри часть скинов не соответствует размерам оригинального оружия, выводы делайте сами.

[h1][i]""Я зашел, а сервера пустые""[/i][/h1]
Да, такая проблема действительно есть - народ подтягивается в районе 4-6 часов вечера по МСК (по моим наблюдениям). За конкретной статистикой - смотрите в Steam Charts.
Причины на это ровно две - первая описана в разделе выше, вторая - [b]чуваки из Валв просрали все полимеры в день запуска игры, выпустив её до запланированного времени[/b]. Сервера не были запущены (кроме одного или двух инстансов), кнопка ""Купить"" не работала - в результате те, кто успел купить до этого, зашли в игру, увидели (условно говоря) один пустой австралийский сервер с пингом >150, вышли, написали отрицательный отзыв и вернули свои деньги.

[h1][i]""Игра логаит уже в меню, гамно, рефаунд!!1""[/i][/h1]
Да, игру и правда нельзя сравнить по уровню оптимизации с мастодонтами вроде Battlefield - и использование UE4 не сильно спасает ситуацию, впрочем, есть пара нюансов.

Во-первых, многие пишущие отзывы не утруждают себя заходом в [b]меню настроек[/b] (sic!), поскольку привыкли, что их любимая каэсочка/дотка работают на высоких.
Во-вторых, проблемы в основном возникают в режимах 10v10 - виной тому рэгдоллы, которые по какой-то причине жрут дохрена ЦП (привет, SW Battlefront!), поэтому [i]количество трупов советую скручивать в ноль, если есть просадки по ЦП[/i].
Ну и с графикой тоже лучше не перегибать - некоторые карты весьма загружены мешами/отражениями/GI (не настолько плохо, как в том же WH40k: Eternal Crusade, впрочем).
[i]Умиротворите свой аппетит к красивым картинкам и будет вам счастье с 60+ фпс.[/i]

Баги с лагающими меню уже поправлены в большинстве своем.

Вот два рига, на которых я играю (в обоих случаях разрешение 1920х1080, Win7 x64):
[list]
[*] i5-4690k @ 4.2 Ghz, GTX 750 2Gb, 16 Gb RAM (DDR3) - [b]55-70 фпс[/b] на средне-высоких;
[*] Quad Q9400 @ 3.2 Ghz, R7 360 2Gb, 6 Gb RAM (DDR2) - [b]30-60 фпс[/b] на средних без трупов и с минимумом кровищи.
[/list]

В целом, если потратить немного времени на настройку, играется лучше чем большинство поделок на Unity.

[h1][i]""В чивалри я мог лучником затыкать тяжелого рыцаря ножиком, а тут не могу, плохая игра""[/i][/h1]
Баланс персонажей и карт, как известно, вещь субъективная. Вспоминается поговорка - [i]""каждый хвалит свое болото""[/i].
Проблемы с балансом действительно были, но бОльшая часть была исправлена ещё во время [b]закрытой беты[/b] (кстати, тогда игра в лучшем случае давала мне 30 фпс, это в дополнение к разделу выше).
Здесь нельзя спамом левой кнопкой за ассасиншу разобрать тарана, да. Кулдаун/урон некоторых абилок стоит немного подкрутить, чем разработчики, впрочем, периодически занимаются. Саппорт (тот жирный мужик) полезен и получает очки за лечение. Можно отражать любые снаряды и удары.

[h1]Теории заговоров и прочие нелепости[/h1]
Не буду комментировать отзывы по типу ""ужасная цветовая гамма"" - думаю, все и так понятно (вы же не будете покупать красный телевизор вместо белого потому, что [strike]RED GOES FASTA[/strike] он красный?).
Еще проскакивал отзыв, якобы разработчики банят на форуме, когда пишут про баги - ложь и провокация. Основной человек, который пишет от их лица на форуме - Reithur - наиспокойнейший человек, лучше него с коммьюнити работают разве что ребята из Boundless или Нельсон из Unturned, на мой взгляд (они чаще отвечают). Иными словами, не творите херни и не судимы будете.

Еще есть ""особые"" ребята, которые говорят, что Mordhau лучше (вот только он до сих пор не вышел, а 300к бачей на кикстартере уже давно собрали). Прямо как с Elite: Dangerous и невышедшим до сих пор Star Citizen.

[h1][b]Так стоит покупать игру или нет?[/b][/h1]
Если Вас не пугает низкий онлайн и вы хотите помочь спасти игру от несправедливой смерти - да.
Если Вас бесят баги в Чивалри и вы ищете игру без багов в melee-комбате - да.
Если Вы хотите иметь возможность зайти в любое время и иметь возможность поиграть в любой режим с нормальным количеством людей - не сейчас.

[i]И да, где-то на форумах проскакивал пост от Рейтура, что планируется добавление [b]PvE[/b]. Могу ошибаться, впрочем, время покажет. Надеюсь, это поможет игре выжить.[/i]



[b]TL; DR:[/b] Виной всему фанбаза (>50%, не будем ровнять всех под одну гребенку) Chivalry и молодчики из Валв, которые испортили день выхода игры. | The game looked interesting at first glance: more variety than Chivalry in classes, added spells, and parrying all types of attacks. However, the game suffers a few flaws.

First and foremost, there is no matchmaking queue or any reason to stick a game out until the end besides rank XP and cosmetics. There aren't many players (at the time of this review the peak player count is 190) so matchmaking seems infeasible, but still it would be nice to have matchmaking with similar skill levels. Since there is no way to know how skilled your teammates and opponents are or get into matches with similarly skilled players, the game can be very frustrating or unsastisfyingly easy. There are few times when a round is actually evenly matched.

Beyond this, there is not much in the game to encourage teamwork. There is no team voice chat for strategizing, only all chat for voice. There is no minimap either just little triangles to show you where teammates are but they don't specify distance either. If your team is spread out, it is hard to tell where people are since their triangles can be in all directions and not immediately visible when looking a particular direction. It would be a lot better if there were systems in place to encourage teamwork, since it is common for a team to sit on the objectives as a full team and never really get pushed off for the entire duration of the game while the other team trickles in one at a time--not realizing that their teammates are all dead. This is a tough situation since even getting 2v1'd is a very one sided experience, and there are no real escape abilities of the characters. If you find yourself battling 2 opponents, you are pretty much dead with no way out.

Further, there are no alternative objectives on the map such as health packs, cooldown reductions, speed boosts, etc. that provide battle incentives. The only similar objects are small ""Jinn"" that drop when an opponent dies which gives a small cooldown reduction and a small health bonus.

As far as the spells go, they are okay with most of them being pretty obvious and not really offering much complexity. For example, there is a boulder, a whirling swing move, a few jump-then-slam moves, and some wide range magic spells. There is one spell that could be used as an escape, Phase, but it is very short in movement and time active. The spells themselves have very long cooldowns of 10 to 30 seconds, even if you kill an enemy and pick up a Jinn you only get about -3 seconds, which is tiny compared to the actual spell cooldown. Often, this translates to killing the first enemy with spells and then any subsequent enemy must be killed with only your weapons. For a game that is trying to add abilities and variety to the PvP slasher genre, this feels like it's tacked on to the format rather than being really integral to combat. Personally, I think the combat would be more interesting with a more diverse set of spells that aren't all just damage spells (aside from like 3) that have lower cooldowns and maybe a little bit less damage. Escapes and manueverability spells would really add to the game.

Speaking of manueverability, the only way to sprint is to hold run until it automatically makes you sprint. There is no toggleable sprint, which is a shame. For a game that already has a stamina bar, it would be really nice to have a stamina-based sprint and a roll/side-step in the game on every character. This would make combat a lot more interesting especially when getting outnumbered.

Finally, the tutorial is really cryptic. There are no HUD elements that let you know if you are parrying or riposteing correctly. There is apparently animation cancelling in the game to chain attacks together, but it is not clear when you do this correctly in the tutorial or in the game because there is no feedback. It also doesn't seem like the animations get very much shorter at all. It would be nice if there was a mode that teaches how to do this correctly with feedback and an indication in game when you animation cancel.

The maps themselves look pretty good though, as well as the cosmetic items.

In sum, there are a lot of things wrong with this game that make it seem clunky and basic. There is certainly depth to the game as far as the weapon combat goes, but the spells don't add much to that. The trailer shows a lot of spell use, but in reality they are few and far between since the cooldowns are so long. However, the two most important criticisms in my opinion are the lack of a rating-based matchmaking system and the lack of a toggleable sprint and roll/side-step. The former makes matches very one-sided pretty consistently since you can play against total noobs or beta veterans and the latter makes combat very parry based and not at all reliant on positioning and disengaging/re-engaging combat.

If they would add these two things and rework the spells to feel less like they are tacked onto chivalry, this would be a really fun game, however, without these I cannot recommend this game at all. | All in all I find this game quite fun, and if you're a fan of timing based, free-form melee combat I definitely suggest it! I'll be going through some of the pros and cons of the game below, as well as any personal gripes or issues I have had thus far:

Pros: 
-Great classes- All 6 of the classes are fun and satisfying to play, though some are have a larger skill gap than others. They all play quite uniquely as their weapons and abilities vary. 

-Fun game modes- All 3 of the game modes are a lot of fun, My personal favorites being 3v3 Arena and 6v6 objective. 10v10 Team Deathmatch is also a lot of fun if you want to just let loose and do some killing without having to worry too much about tactics. 

-Interesting colour palettes and aesthetics- Though some people dislike the games art style, I quite enjoy it, too many games are all greys and browns now a days!

-Simple but interesting maps- The maps play quite well, none of them are overcomplicated and balanced well enough that it would be difficult for a team to camp one spot for long. As objectives move closer to the defenders spawns things become much more intense and can lead to some really interesting comeback or draw moments. 

-High Skill cieling- Combat between high level players is really fun to watch and play! Due to the removal of reverse overheads and the like Combinations of abiliites and normal attacks allow you to mix up the fighting in ways that players can still counter if they are quick enough. 

Cons:
-Low player count- This is probably one of the biggest issues at the moment, one which can only really be adressed over time as the game gathers people that enjoy the mechanics and stick with the game rather than Rage quitting. Even with the low player count, I don't typically have much trouble finding or starting a server in peak hours, and simply hopping into an empty server often fills up pretty quick if there aren't any others up. 

-Unbalanced teams can be frustrating- Due to how the game is balanced, full lobbies are a ton of fun, but when one team doesn't have as many players as the other (Be it caused by rage quitters, or simply uneven numbers in a server) it becomes very one-sided unless the handicapped team has people good enough to carry and make up for it.  Team objective can be especially frustrating when you are a player down.

-Performance issues in 10v10- This is potentially an issue with my own setup (GTX 1070, Radeon 9590 4.7ghz, 16GB RAM) but I see a huge performance drop when servers have any more than 14 people. At 12 people I get about 60-70 FPS, and once any more than that join, it drops down to about 30-40 FPS, which in a timing based melee slasher such as this is basically unplayable. Turning down settings seems to make no difference, which causes me to suspect it is some type of CPU optimization issue, or bottlenecking on my end


All that being said, if you like the idea of a class based, Small team melee slasher with abilities and magic mixed in, I definitely recommend it. While some mechanics are similar to the games predecessor chivalry; Do not expect this to be chivalry 2. The small teams and abilities make it play more like Overwatch than chivalry, though the old melee slasher style combat is still present. I personally think it adds another layer of complexity, but there is definitely a lot of dislike and hate towards the game from the old CHiv community. 

If you like melee combat, Team based gameplay, and magic, Don't let the Ex-chiv player hate train and the small population discourage you from buying. The community is small but pretty tightly knit, and always  willing to answer questions and help new players get used to the gameplay and changes from Chivalry."

玩家扮演一個陷入無限輪迴、權力受到宰制的王后，協助國王處理政務
日常處處受限、步步為營，具體表現在需要維持宗教、民生、軍事、財政四項指標的平衡，避免過高或過低，否則會觸發死亡結局
王后死亡後便輪到新一任的王后，每次舊王后的死亡是新王后的誕生，繼承前任王后的物品和人際關係
基本玩法是左右滑動卡片，兩邊設置不同的選項，每個選項影響不同指標的數值，同時決定故事走向，推進故事發展
本質是解謎遊戲，完成遊戲佈置的任務，解決決鬥室的謎題，解鎖新卡片、新人物，升級獲得的新道具，最後達成真結局
把特定道具扔給卡片人物，或者跟特定角色締結友好關係，多少挽回四項指標見底或全滿的末路
譬如，香水扔給主教可抵擋一次宗教指標見底的BE，結交博士建哲學塔可抵擋一次民生指標全滿的BE

中世紀奇幻世界觀，集合了基督教、女巫信仰、煉金術士、吸血鬼等西方奇幻常見元素
遊戲有聊勝於無的後設元素，真結局揭露的真相不明所以
玩家作出的部分決策，偶爾彈出統計數據，對比其她王后（玩家），告知這個選項所佔百分比
卡片人物偶然跳出來吐嘈玩家，跟玩家交流

遊戲採用莫名其妙的星座元素，雖然契合中世紀背景，綜觀遊戲內容，卻不見得星座元素的設計有何巧妙之處
我對神秘學毫無興趣，不清楚星座符號及其意涵，只覺得每次開局記住星座符號很麻煩
決鬥室其中一個謎題跟塔羅牌有關，「愚人」的謎底是「青年俊傑踏征程」
遊戲製作人真以為所有人都認識塔羅牌嗎？我能成功是使用刪除法，一個一個測試和除錯

中文翻譯太爛了，普通文本諸多缺漏，語句不通順，也就罷了
決鬥室的謎題翻譯得不知所云，阻礙玩家理解，影響遊戲體驗，實在不能忍

[h2] 女性與權力 [/h2]

這是一款面向女性玩家的遊戲，以女性為中心發展的故事，大結局也揭示了這一點
王后可以資助女性健康方面的研究，學習侍女們獨創的秘密語言，選用女性軍官帶領軍隊
遊戲有一些關於女權主義的幽默笑話，蜻蜓點水式的玩梗，並非認真對待
為什麼女權主義女神是一個男性角色呢？

女性角色的數量不少：除了王后、侍女、貴婦人等傳統女性身份，還有刺客、勇士、海盜、女巫、商人、博士、煉金術士等各種各樣身份的女性
當中有的可以結盟，有的成為朋友，有的可以發展同性戀情
人物設計簡化，外觀由大面積的色塊構成
女性角色外型總有一些刻板印象元素來凸顯這是女性，例如長髮、粉紅色、胸部性徵等等
這種設計部分是符合背景，基於上流社會女性的裝扮要求
可是，女巫、女神、煉金術士等虛構身份的女角色，不需要女性刻板印象的設計

雖然是女性主角的遊戲，但不代表是女性友好
遊戲使用一些如蛇蠍女、最毒婦人等等的厭女詞彙
當王后暗殺國王，便會得到最毒婦人的新卡片
男人手刃多少人類，也沒有得到最惡毒的評價，反而把髒水潑到女性身上了

遊戲不乏虐待女性的元素，顯而易見是王后的死亡輪迴
設計出花樣百出的女性死亡方式，似有玩弄女性死亡和品嚐女性苦難之慊
遊戲為無盡的死亡結局賦予一些特殊意義，背後邏輯是女性必須受苦受難才能獲得安息和解脫

遊戲世界是貶抑女性的父權社會，處於女人是男人附屬品，女性地位低下的時代，存在諸多性別歧視
王后被要求做個安守本分的貴族婦女，即使王后身份高貴，仍然不得進入某些僅限男性的地方

左右滑動的玩法會陷入假兩難的局面，譬如遊戲常見的身體意象議題
主教叫王后不要穿著暴露，玩家只能在順從或別管我二選一
前者遵從傳統保守的好女人規訓，後者看似有主見但是自由男權那一套的自由論調
選前者會被傳統男權噁心到，選後者會被自由男權噁心到，還可以有其她選擇的呀！

主角是王后，也就是國王的女人，主角身份必定會沾男，跟男人打交道
王后負責的事情，除了一般政務，還要處理國王的關係，宮廷人情世故，還有一些瑣碎事情
即使國王昏庸無能碌碌無為，政事由王后主理，國王的權力仍高於王后，能夠決定王后的生死
當軍事指標全滿，王后便會被國王以保護之名，行禁錮之實，一生失去自由

女性奪權之路依舊建基於依附男人權勢地位的前設上
王后想要奪權，一種是國王意外死亡，另一種是生下兒子再暗殺國王
兩種方式都顯得被動、迂迴，有別於直接的政治鬥爭
前者不是王后主動爭取，而是臨危受命，不可不為之
後者王后需要迎合父權規則，方能實現個人野心
遊戲的設定是女性需要依附男人，做丈夫的妻子和兒子的母親才能間接得到權力
按照史實的話，鼎鼎大名的伊莉莎白一世終生未婚，製作組大可以設定主角一開始就是權傾天下的女王
為什麼遊戲採取王后身份這種局限性的設定呢？遊戲編劇Leigh Alexander的遊戲理念便是答案
她認為權力幻想很無聊，女王直接影響國王而非王國會更有趣
這不就是男人征服世界，女人征服男人的男權幻想敘事嗎？難怪主角要沾男了

[h2] 繁瑣的遊戲性 [/h2]

卡片隨機性是遊戲的一大缺點，雖然能增加一些耐玩度，但長期而言是折磨玩家的設定
遊戲每次輪迴，隨機抽取卡片，跟遊戲角色互動
一開始接觸有新鮮感，玩久了便感到乏味無聊，越來越煩厭
隨機事件重重複複，角色互動單調無趣，變相浪費時間

遊戲設置的謎題，需在特定星座才可觸發事件，要是錯過了，便要再來一個輪迴
雖然可到迷宮更改星座，但進入迷宮事件本就有隨機性，不一定如願進入迷宮
即使轉到特定星座，也因為卡片的隨機性，不一定會出現想要的結果
很有可能遇不到特定角色便掛掉，硬生生錯過了事件，又要再來一個週期的輪迴
這一系列的操作流程，非常惱人且火大，消磨玩家的耐性
比方說，去見森林女王的條件是巨蟹座時代找到狐狸，千辛萬苦等到了巨蟹座，卡片隨機生成，不能保證可以碰到狐狸，或會沒維持好四個指標就掛掉了，又要重新轉到巨蟹座找狐狸

大結局破關後該輪迴結束，刪除當下的記錄，重新開始遊戲：升級的道具全部消失，又要重新解開層層重疊的謎團
遊戲基本的save load功能也沒有，想要刷三個大結局，便要重玩三次
每一次輪迴起碼需時兩三個小時，一點也不方便玩家

[h2] 遊戲感想 [/h2]

我一周目不怎麼看攻略打了END1，三四個小時的遊戲體驗良好，怎料越玩越雷人，越玩越火大
在知曉大部分謎題的情況下，我開始二周目，很快便被遊戲的隨機性噁心到
就算懂得謎團破解的方法，也不知道能否抽到卡片，不知道能否遇到事件，難以預料到底花多少時間
遊戲實在太坑了！超級賭爛卡片隨機性+維持四個指標+特定星座觸發事件疊滿的噁心設置
這種隨機性設計違反了多勞多得熟能生巧的常理，簡直是噩夢，為什麼要這樣設計呢？
我眼睜睜看著一堆重複又重複的文字，感受只得煩厭和暴躁可言
刷卡片刷到我懷疑人生，玩這個遊戲有什麼意義呢？

更噁心的事件來了，遊戲的重要道具火槍，獲得條件是必須跟國王生兒子，女兒不行
女兒生下來後，選擇送到城裡或教會，結果都是差不多，一定要生下兒子當繼承人才能觸發事件
這個噁心的設定跟男權世界觀脫不了關係，只得男人才有繼承權
這個周目的王后輪迴了不知多少次都是生女兒，當我看到王后生下女兒，感到非常失望
因為我知道要廢檔了，這次輪迴不能要了，我又要重新刷過，於是立即弄掛了王后
我刷了不知道多少遍，等到王后終於生下了兒子，我感到十分欣喜，終於可以推進劇情了
這個遊戲一定是父權人快樂模擬器，讓我狠狠地體驗了墮女追男的感受
遊戲重現了父權制度對女性生育的壓迫，還得是玩家自己親自動手的，驚不驚嚇？
本來我還在猶豫應否給遊戲正評，畢竟遊戲在女性意識方面並非一無是處，這下子毫不猶豫選擇負評了

我為了刷真結局白白浪費時間在刷卡片、走迷宮、生兒子（沒錯是兒子）
最後我把全部道具都升到滿級，這次一定能打到真結局吧？
怎料我手快快按掉了「別跟我爭了」那一句，遊戲便結束輪迴，這個周目的記錄已被刪除
我又要重新打一次，但一想到隨機性的折磨，各種各樣不爽的設定，與其重玩一次，不如拿這些時間來寫評論

Each station is unique and has to be built in a different way to accomplish your goals. You have free range to do that however you want, which is lots of fun when it works out, but can seem frustrating if it fails. There are different difficulty levels, so it can be as challenging (or not!) as you'd like.

When things are going well, it's fun to sit back and watch your sim: where do people go? what do they buy?  did they make it onto their train in time? hey, that guy is drunk! He's puking everywhere! The mop? do we have enough mops?!

When things get iffy (like your station reputation is dropping) it's time to go into management mode: buy the right tools, get your staff into position, lower prices, put in a new lvl 3 plant. 

As you progress, you can upgrade both your staff and facilities to make each station easier and more successful. The later levels can be very complicated with large stations, several tracks and entrances, and three different floors to add elevators to. Honestly I stick with the easier levels for a more chill experience.

Not as big as a fan of those events (eg multiple people having flu/many vandals etc). Also staffs go into break with the tools still equipped and you have to manually unequip them. Commuters have a lot of asks (especially when you unlock new stuff) and reputation can be hard to maintain in the early game. Not being able to build at the same vertical space of an existing tile.

I couldn't even make it through the tutorial though because it's just too much. The game already started to look like a major chore. The weird road connections, conveyor mechanics, UI from the 90s (may be intentional?) and very odd English translation make it unbearable very fast. I'm off to play Cities Skylines, but someone will definitely enjoy this game. Thanks for the memories, developers! | 8.5小时打完新手教程第一个战役，很难但很好玩，可以自己设置难度，看着人民生活的好和出口挣外汇很开心"

They introduce a new DLC expansion, but apparently never test it once to see that they have broken half the cards in the game. All of a sudden discount cards no longer provide discounts, the UI just randomly disappears, alerts and messages pop up multiple times. It really is a joke. | As old card bugs are fixed, new bugs are always introduced, repeatedly breaking the gameplay and strategies.
Not visually appealing.
Overly interested in getting your money from DLCs. | The board game is amazing and while this PC version looks good, it is riddled with so many bugs and questionable design decisions that i wonder if the developers are intentionally trying to sabotage the game. The initial game on release was absolutely unplayable with bugged timers, bugged cards, disconnects and more, but after a lengthy time they managed to patch it to a somewhat playable state. But it seems that every time they release new content they break the game, as is the case with the latest patch where a large fraction of the cards don't even work. I refuse to believe that they even test before they release. | This is a 10/10 boardgame, however this version is just brutal at times. Countless bugs, really easy to grief and completely waste someones time by going afk. Mechanics are poorly designed (time bank should have limited use per turn (~2 mins to combat griefing), can't undo playing a card on your turn (you might reduce your own prod without realising), soooo many menu/UI bugs, the list goes on.
I love this game but I cannot recommend buying this version.

Train DLC should get an update, so it works better, and has the same polish as the rest of the game, especially because it should be part of base game IMO.

76561198032898393,807120,Iratus: Lord of the Dead,1.8333333333333333,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",2,"The game is a fun Darkest-Dungeon-like, but it is ultimately too slow and repetitive for its own good. In darkest dungeon, you're characters only ever level up 6 times. That makes each time they level up feel super valuable. In this game, your characters level up constantly and because of that, each level isn't nearly as impactful. So you spend a lot of time looking at stats and adjusting them slightly, especially once you unlock the building to help level characters which you aren't sending into battle. 

Not only that, but some of the characters are just straight up way more useful than others. As the game progresses, it tries to introduce more risk reward mechanics. Characters hurting themselves or buffing the enemy to deal extra damage and such. But in a game where losing one character means losing so much progress, you never want to hurt your own minions or buff the enemy, because it is just more effective to use minions which deal damage consistently (or have AoE effects which just make every other ability inefficient). So you end up alternating between maybe two-thirds of the minions you have and trying to avoid using the rest as much as possible. Because this game isn't as complex as Darkest Dungeon, where some heroes really shine in specific encounters but are terrible in others, these kinds of mechanics just end up feeling more frustrating than anything else. It also takes so long to unlock new kinds of minions, because instead of them having a chance to randomly encounter them, you have to meet certain thresholds to do so.

The number of trinkets available to place on your minions is also criminally low and many of the mechanics, like building your own trinkets or going on quests feel under baked. They don't adjust relative to everything else as you and your minions level up, so they end up feeling obsolete relatively early in the game. Maybe if I played the game longer and got into those really difficult later levels, I would feel some sense of scarcity and appreciation for these mechanics. But as it is, I don't have the patience to keep grinding that long. 

Finally, the ""hardcore tactical rogue-like"" gameplay contrasts heavily with the ""boobs and blood"" aesthetic of the game. I wouldn't mind the weird objectification of what are essentially dead bodies so much if the game just committed to being a cheesy romp. But the crypt-keeper puns and juvenile visuals don't complement the tactical decision making. The main voice actor does a great job, but the material he's working with doesn't do him any favors. In Darkest Dungeon, you want to hear Wayne June's little comments about the game. The timber of his voice and the quality of his dialogue adds to the game, it doesn't become an annoying detraction after a few hours. 

So, yeah, it's fun and tense when you first start out, but as it unfortunately becomes a slog. If you can get it on sale, it's got a few hours of discovery and enjoyment before the cracks start to show. | Очень доволен этой игрой, хотя по началу думал об этой игре примерно так: ""блин выглядит как Darkest dungeon, а мне он не зашел, наверно и эта игра не зайдет, но попробую раз игра по хорошей скидке"". По итогу эта игра цепляет и затягивает своим хорошим визуалом, субъективно стилистически лучше упомянутого dd, а сам концепт игры подкупает тем, что гг - главный антогонист, что в играх встречается редко. В игре есть хорошая реиграбельность и вполне адекватное количество контента на пару прохождений игры уж точно, советую к прохождению. | love the game, but after some time i couldnt start my game anymore without getting a bluescreen of death. | You travel through randomly-generated maps that remind one of Slay the Spire - a few different paths with different basic encounter types along each path you can see before you choose a direction.

Сюжет простий. Сталася війна/катастрофа, людство заховалось на орбітальній станції. І коли на планеті трошки стало краще, вирішили її наново заселити. Ваша задача допомогти людству з цим. Ну ось ніби все. Якогось лору чи розкриття його майже не має. Все дуже просто.

Графіка. Тут вона неймовірна. Все детально промальовано. Всі елементи карти, приміщень виглядають неймовірно як з далеку, так і при максимальному приближені. Робота заводі,фабрик, ферм, захисних споруд виглядають на тверду 10! Це було дуже неочікувано. Я був дуже приємно вражений.

Аудіо. Музика в грі досить непогана. Не надокучлива і цікава. Навіть є різна музика під різні ситуації. Звуки теж добре зроблені. Єдине що діставав помічник, який казав що якесь приміщення горить і тому подібне. На максимальній швидкості це дуже часто повторювалось !!!

Ігролад. Стандартний для стратегій такого типу. Збираєш ресурси, будуєш приміщення і так по колу. Ще є дослідження, Торгівля. Але і дещо цікаве. Нажавши TAB ви переходите в режим від 1-го лиця і можете мандрувати містом/картою. Навіть зайти в приміщення чи політати на дронах. І це дуже цікаво. Ігролад цікавий і не приїдається.  Він дуже різноманітний.

Локалізація. Офіційна від розробників (Так, так. Уявляєте ? Є нормальні українські розробники, які одразу додають українську в свої ігри !!!) Локалізація чудово. Помилок не побачив. Все супер.

Гра дуже цікава та захоплююча, якби мав більше часу, то пограв би в неї подовше. Але.... 
Але є декілька незрозумілостей. Наприклад я не зрозумів як працює підземна система доставки. Не має як побачити її роботу і чи працює вона. Не зрозумів як працює водогін та передача електрики через мости. В грі не вистачає інформації про те як працюють деякі приміщення. А ще вважаю що обмеження на доставку трошки зайвим. Хоча б прибрати ї в поїздах. Та і торгівля мостами теж дивна. Одностороння якась. 
Гра не ідеальна. Але дуже цікава. Тому я її рекомендую до придбання та ознайомлення. З знижкою має бути в списку ТОП 5 на придбання. 

Плюси:
 + Українська гра та мова.
 + Графіка та дизайн
 + Ігролад
 + Музичне оформлення
 
Мінуси:
 + Відсутність чіткого розуміння як правильно працюють деякі приміщення
 + Відсутність кампанії

The only issue I have is the recent update to add exclaimation marks over buildings not receiving resources.

I would love to have the ability to turn this off in the options menu. The same goes for the priority display, which is insanely useful, but can feel like it's interrupting the experience when just trying to look at my creation for what it is. Would like to be able to turn the display on and off as needed. | It was fun for the most part.
Yes, it took some time to get going, a couple of attempts working through the basic steps the tutorial leads you through, which I found useful for setting you up for the plunge. But in the end, I got to 21 medals, and that was enough.

На вид неказистая, типичное инди, но игровой процесс просто великолепный.

It starts a little slow, I'd say just keep pushing yourself because the higher difficulties is where the real fun is at.

For such a simple premise there is a surprising amount of depth with both the character builds and the levels. Learning the secrets and getting the books is all part of learning the game, and it's an area which i think really brings people together because carrying the books or completing the puzzles has to be a group effort.

Сюжет клішований - якщо є Древньо-Єгипетська тема, то має бути якесь повстале страшко/божок, яке планує знищити світ і оживляє навколо себе різну нечисть. Браві герої, які не дуже ясно звідки взялися і як об'єдналися виступають проти цього зла, паралельно розгадуючи приховані секрети локацій і грабуючи гробниці. Можливо для більш глибокого розуміння подій треба було трохи почитати місцеві колекційні журнали і ввімкнути субтитри до діалогів, але я вирішив забити, адже гра явно не про неймовірний сюжет.

Геймплейно це шутер від третьої особи. На кількох відносно лінійних картах досліджуємо локації, потряплятимемо на закриті арени, де відбиватимемо кілька хвиль ворогів, далі знов перепочинок, а потім знову арена. В кінці більшості карт ще можуть трапитися не дуже складні боси. Вороги знову ж типові для жанру: скелети, мумії чи мінотаври, а статуї богів, що ожили типу Гора або Анубіса виступають в ролі тих самих босів. Деякі екземпляри звичайних ворогів представляють гравцю один в один як з ""Мумії"", від чого я відчув присмак ностальгії за тими часами, коли вперше з захватом дивився стрічку чи її сиквел.

Розробники з Rebellion шутерну механіку залишили такою ж, яка є в їхньому флагмані - Sniper Elite, лише вирізавши все, що пов'язане саме зі снайперками типу рентгенівських пострілів, стелсу і тд. Тут в основному автомати та гвинтівки і відкритий бій з десятками ворогів. Стрільба не топ, але терпима, якийсь імпакт від зброї відчувається. Всього є +-10 видів основної зброї і кілька пістолетів, які використовувати майже немає сенсу через малий дамаг, лише якщо набої в основі закінчилися.

Інша сторона геймплею - пошуки скарбів. На кожній мапі є багацько місць з скринями, у них трапляється золото (за яке можна купляти нове озброєння) або апгрейди для зброї (типу хіл за вбивство, більше шкоди від хедшотів і тд). Окремо варто згадати щось на кшталт гробниць. Кожна знаходиться за дверима, які відкриваються лише з рішенням загадки на них. Десь потрібно знайти відповідну послідовність зображень, в іншій - скласти шлях ""змійці"" від старту до фінішу тощо. На початку цікаво, але в якийсь момент загадки починають повторюватися і єдине, що залишає інтерес - пошук розгадки в новому місці. Прикро, адже для менш як десятка місій можна було вигадати різні унікальні головоломки.

Також варто згадати режим орди, де на кількох аренах нам дають виживати під атаками хвиль ворогів. Там потрібно заробляти золото, щоб купляти нову зброю та відкривати різні двері з апгрейдами. Один раз зіграти - може бути, але дуже швидко набридає, особливо враховуючи, що нічого супер нового і відмінного від основної гри тут немає. Те ж саме і в режимі гри на бали. Карти інші, але геймплей той самий і без суттєвих нагород, хіба потрапити в таблицю лідерів, щоб серед друзів там світитися.

Якихось технічних проблем я взагалі не помітив, лише біда з високим пінгом критично відображаються на геймплеї на високій складності - фізично неможливо уникнути пошкоджень, адже вороги завдають ударів, яких на екрані клієнта ще не відбулося, а шкоду він отримав. На насичених ворогами і мінібосами-мінотаврами аренах це було вкрай неприємно і смертельно. Тож в кооперативі рекомендую грати з ""сусідами""))

Сказати, що Strange Brigade чудова й неймовірна язик не повертається. Це досить проста гра без якихось неймовірних геймплейних можливостей чи ВАУ ефектів. Просто хороша забавка, щоб зануритися черговий раз в єгипетську тематику та повалити мертвяків в один з вечорів після роботи, бажано - в компанії з товаришем/ами, так буде веселіше.

1. It has ""humans"" but they are easily replaced by conveyors quite early in game and then they are objectively better
2. Trains are lackluster and just investing in conveyors is better for short, medium and long term
3. Chutes are an unique idea and I loved it. Its like a cheap gravity powered conveyor that you can get in early game but remains viable throughout. 
4. The support mechanic is similar to minecraft. You don't need pillars. So, that makes boats obsolete too as you can just build a floating conveyor over the water which is waaaay more efficient in short, medium and long term. 
5. The campaign forces you to build things you don't really need.
6. Building upgrade is inspired by Anno series.

Its like if Anno and Factorio had a lowpoly child. | I think this game is awesome and I have spent a lot of hours into it. A very cozy factory game with nice music/sounds and a nice overall vibe to it.
I have not played so much automation games and this is perhaps not for everyone because of how much changes in supply chains can effect what you already have set up , and that suddenly your perfect networks stops working because of new situations that you need to make changes for - but I think it's a very nice thing about this game that you need to rethink and rebuild. 
I really like the Happiness feature that you get production boost within the town centre area that makes you really value space and try to squeze in as much production you can and also increase happiness to expand that area.

It's quite easy to learn but a bit harder to master and it can be quite advanced if you want it to. Also it can probably be a little bit overwhelming after a while but I guess that goes for most games in the factory / automation genre.
I thought that the lack of difficulty (you can't really screw up without being able to recover) would get to me after a while but still after hundreds of hours I think it's just a lovely and cozy game and I make the game interesting by trying to do more complicated things and using copute blocks trying to maximize output. And of course, Trains :)

On the negative side there are some features that are not explained in game and the wiki is not fully updated but all my questions I have found answers to by the community. 
Also it get's a little grindy in endgame if you are trying to get the currency for the upgrades you can do in the later part of the game. 

Overall a big recommendation if you want a cozy game with some advanced features and you are satisfied that the difficulty level are not very high. I don't think you can fail.

76561198032898393,865360,We Were Here Together,0.0,"Adventure, Casual, Indie",0,"После прохождения двух бесплатных частей этой франшизы, конечно же появляется большое желание приобрести и пройти остальные части, потому что в такой стилистике и в такой подаче, еще игр не встречал и это очень сильно цепляет(разве что на ум приходит только онлайн игра огонь и вода, хоть это и 3д). Между самой первой We Were Here, которая была просто милой маленькой бесплатной инди-игрой, и второй частью, которая вышла относительно не давно и раздавалась бесплатно для привлечения внимания, так понимаю. Действительно можно видеть улучшения. Глядя на Together, можно видеть, что деньги, которые получили разработчики, были вложены в хорошие руки, и это напрямую перешло в качество.

Игра значительно улучшилась, ну в основном с точки зрения графики и повествования в катсценах. Геймплей не сильно изменился, а внесенные изменения были в основном просто ответами на проблемы, которые, возникали у большинства людей в предыдущих играх.

В целом, это отличная игра-головоломка для всех. Если у вас есть друг, с которым вы просто хотите провести время и на удивление немного подумать и воспользоваться логикой, то вы оказались в отличном месте. Без сомнений, одна из лучших логических игр, в которые мне довелось играть. Определенно стоит своих денег.

Из минусов могу отметить лишь только, то что очень странно работает система чата для общение в игре, оно то работает без рации, то только с рацией(при чем когда рядом два перса находятся близко или наоборот далеко, то слышно, то не слышно без рации, вообщем не понятно). Изначально хотелось пройти игру с игровым голосовым чатом, но встретившись с каким то багами с этим, решили все же играть просто в дс.

Сами головоломки различаются и много разнообразия, что действительно интересно их разгадывать, даже если иногда не понимаешь. Первая головоломка - это просто найти скрытые объекты с несколькими вентелями, но после этого вам быстро придется работать параллельно с вашим другом, чтобы выяснить, что вам нужно сделать дальше, и почти каждая головоломка будет чрезвычайно утомительной и самое интересное, бывают некоторые головомки, где одному приходится больше думать и взаимодействовать, а второму лишь передавать информацию, а иногда все сразу одновременно. Первая область просто готовит игроков к совместному тим-ворку, но после этого момента We Were Here Together разделяет обоих игроков и все же окутывает их несколькими головоломками, над которыми придется работать одновременно. Это может быть что угодно, от серии лифтов, которые каким-то образом связаны, до моста, который соединен со странной табличкой, которую игрокам придется разгадать. Либо на время быстро, что то сделать, ибо ваш друг умрёт.

В целом я настоятельно рекомендую эту игру любителям головоломок или тем, кто хочет играть в кооперативе. Это точно маст хев.

 | Me pase un puzzle gracias a un ruso que se hizo un cuaderno con dibujos de todas las posibles combinaciones

buenardo | Chapter 8 is severely bugged. The room straight up doesn't load some of the puzzle elements for one of the pair, and the elements that load are bugged (but not in an obvious enough way to make sure that you can understand that it is bugged). Me and my companion spent over 1hr30min just on that room alone, getting more and more frustrated, until I finally decided to search for the solution online... And the first result is a post from 4 years ago in Reddit explaining the exact same bug we encountered. This game is still being sold. There was never a bug fix. My faith on attempting to actually solve any of the future puzzles is completely gone, because now if any puzzles are too hard, me and my companion will just assume that it is bugged. The game is mostly fun, but the lack of a hint system and the seemingly complete lack of care for the state of game while it is still being charged for makes me absolutely not recommend this game for anyone. | Joguei esse jogo com uma pessoa muito especial.

Wish they had continued with the dlc, especially since there are so many departments they could've added such as plastics, pediatrics and others (some of these can be added via mods but the modders can only work with what the devs already implemented) | Kurzversion:
Schönes Bau- und Management-Spiel mit relativ realistischem, medizinischen Hintergrund.
Sowohl das Bauen, als auch das Heilen kann man (mit konstenlosem DLC) optional übernehmen.
Die vorgefertigen Stories füllen etwa 20-30 Stunden, danach kann man das Spiel im Sandboxmodus und durch die Workshop-Unterstützung endlos weiterspielen.

Klare Kaufempfehlung! 8/10


Längere Version:
Am Anfang ist es etwas schwierig, ins Spiel reinzufinden, aber man hat eine ziemlich steile Lernkurve.
Man muss auf jeden Fall Lust haben, etwas zu lernen und gerade am Anfang viele kleine Erklärungen (zu Diagnosen, Erkrankungen oder Therapien) lesen. Fachpersonal ist hier natürlich im Vorteil ;)

Der Baumodus ist übersichtlich gestaltet und enthält neben vorgefertigten Räumen auch die Möglichkeit, sich dekorativ und auch funktionell frei austoben zu können. Gerade am Anfang muss man aber sehr darauf achten, die Gelder priorisierter einzusetzen, wofür man eben ein bisschen Erfahrung braucht.
Man sollte ebenfalls beachten, dass immer mehr Patienten kommen werden und man dafür Fläche vorplanen muss. Das ist aber gerade am Anfang relativ schwer! Deshalb meine Empfehlung: Spielt die vorgefertigten Kampagnen, um eine Übersicht des Patienten- und Stationsverhalten zu bekommen.

Die Mitarbeiter auf den Stationen bringen verschiedene Grundfähigkeiten mit und bekommen ein Gehalt in Abhängigkeit ihrer Fähigkeiten und des aktuellen Levels. Im Verlauf des Spiels steigen diese dann immer weiter auf. Durch einen Statistikmodus kann man auch gut den laufenden Betrieb auswerten und schauen, welche Räume bzw. Mitarbeiter man braucht.
Das ist das wohl wichtigste Tool, da man hiermit das Wachstum an die Auslastung anpassen kann. Das ist natürlich wichtig, weil man auf Dauer schwarze Zahlen schreiben möchte.

Der Arztmodus ist auch übersichtlich gehalten und durch die Einstellungen wird das Spiel pausiert, wenn eine Aktion vollzogen werden muss. Wenn man 2-3 Ärzte kontrolliert, ist man quasi nur am ""rumdoktorn"". Die Anzahl der Ärzte kann aber IMMER angepasst werden und dementsprechend muss man NICHT Doktor sein. (Auch wenn's ab und zu mal ein Angebot gibt, besonders komplizierte Patienten zu behandeln.)
Im Arztmodus muss man allerdings selbstständig die Diagnostik auswählen, weshalb medizinisches Fachwissen von Vorteil sein kann. Wer keinerlei Fachwissen mitbringt, wird gerade am Anfang sehr viel lesen müssen, wobei selbst das nicht unbedingt ausreichend ist. Kurzum: Man muss wirklich nachdenken, wenn man nicht blind alle möglichen Untersuchungen auswählt. (Kann man auch, frisst dann aber Ressourcen! Wer jedes Mal CT und MRT macht, muss dafür auch ausreichend Kapazitäten haben!)

Man merkt aber hier, dass das Spiel höchstwahrscheinlich nicht von medizinischem Fachpersonal kommt. Meckern auf hohem Niveau: Bestimmte Erkrankungen können nicht mit eigentlich richtigen Diagnose-Verfahren festgestellt werden. So muss ein Pneumothorax über bildgebende Verfahren aufgeklärt werden, anstatt über Perkussion und Abhören.
Des Weiteren können bestimmte Medikamente nur auf bestimmten Stationen verabreicht werden. Das bei akuter Angina Pectoris eine Überweisung von der Notaufnahme in die Kardiologie erfolgt, ist auch unrealistisch.
Im Allgemeinen sind die Diagnosen, Erkrankungen und Therapieformen realistisch gestaltet und man merkt, dass sich viel Mühe gemacht wurde, nicht nur Fachfremde zu unterhalten.

Die Archivements bekommt man während des normalen Spielverlaufs ""nachgeschmissen"" und sind ansonsten leicht während der vorgefertigten Missionen erspielbar.

Das Spiel ist eine klare Kaufempfehlung für alle, die Bau-/Managementsimulationen mögen und medizinisches Interesse haben, weil man dann alle Aspekte des Spieles voll ausschöpfen kann.
Wer weniger Spaß am aufbauen hat, kann auch vorgefertigte Krankenhäuser jeder beliebigen Größe spielen. Diese sind allerdings nicht perfekt und müssen laufend verbessert werden. Ein reiner ""Arztsimulator"" ist das Spiel also nie.
Wer nur Bauen und managen will, wird auch seinen Spaß haben, allerdings steht dann etwas weniger Content zur Verfügung und langfristige Ziele werden deutlich schneller erreicht, weil das Spiel selbst schneller voranschreitet. | 东西还是比较硬核的，但其实可以电脑自动诊断，我们玩家多数情况下需要的是进行整体的布局规划，包括安排路线、划分区域，解决患者问题等。所以实际上是建造游戏，个人还是比较喜欢的！

- I HATE HACKING, I DON'T CARE FOR IT, TAKE IT AWAY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD | [h2] Endless Space 2 - Наследница первой пробы пера [/h2]
[i] Я начинал свой путь еще с Endless Space 1 и Endless Space 2 является достойным продолжением вселенной Endless. Участвовал в бета тесте игры и активностях на форуме разработчиков (Таких как выбор внешности некоторых фракций - Несгибаемые и Хор Теней). У игры был долгий путь разработки и она стала результатом трудов, в том числе, многих фанатов вселенной Endless. Что получилось в итоге? [/i]
[h2] За что стоит ее любить эту игру [/h2] 
[list]
    [*][i] Фракции - каждая фракция уникальна, любой игрок сможет выбрать фракцию на свой вкус. Некоторые перекочевали из первой части, но еще больше новых. Основных фракций восемь (без дополнений). Каждая фракция имеет свой сюжет и приличное количество заданий, что помогут познакомиться с ними поближе. 
Например, хочешь быть безумным ученым? Софоны будут тебе по душе, а внешне они напоминают причудливых зеленых человечков. 
Думаешь, что путь к победе, это развитие промышленности и влияние? Единая империя (Местное человечество) идет по этому пути, но даже этот путь ты сможешь изменить. Остаться на пути промышленности, стать ученым или наращивать военную мощь? Ты сможешь принимать судьбоносные решения. [/i]
    [*][i] Геймплей - По сравнению с Endless Space 1 и Endless Legend, расширили и сделали глубже все элементы 4х-стратегий. 
Прохождение основного сюжета поведает вам Академии, космической гильдии героев и ее лидере. Наличие множества побочных заданий, наткнуться на которые ты сможешь просто исследуя мир. Без преувеличения, интересное исследование бескрайнего космоса, где даже исследование странного сигнала на планете, может привести к неожиданному результату. 
Изучение различных веток технологий, от возможности колонизации неприветливых миров до постройки огромных военных крейсеров. Колонизация новых миров и их развитие, в том числе уникальных планет, что были оставлены древней, более развитой расой. Огромное количество торговых и дипломатических возможностей, от покупки ценных ресурсов до заключения альянса между империями. И самые проработанные и захватывающие космические сражения, лучшие в своем жанре. [/i]
    [*][i] Графика - Начиная с главного меню и заканчивая роликом победы одной из фракций, все что вы уведите, будет выглядеть волшебно и завораживающе. Эта игра подарит вам ощущение бескрайнего и неизведанного, местами причудливого космоса (Как на счет фракции высокоразвитых деревьев или роботов, что больше напоминают насекомых поглощающих все на своем пути?). Каждый арт, каждый ролик или эффект от взрыва планеты выполнен на недосягаемо качественном уровне. На мой личный взгляд, в этой игре космос выполнен лучше всего и крупные франшизы, такие как Mass Effect или Star Wars не передают даже крупицы этой красоты. [/i]
    [*][i] Музыка Endless Space 2 - это шедевр, который погружает вас в атмосферу космоса и подчеркивает эпичность происходящего. Композитор Arnaud Roy создал великолепный саундтрек, который идеально сочетается с визуальным стилем игры и подчёркивает уникальность каждой фракции. Музыка разнообразна и эмоциональна. Здесь вы услышите эпические и величественные мелодии, которые сопровождают ваши великие открытия и завоевания, а также более спокойные и лирические треки, которые звучат во время мирного развития империи. [/i]
[/list]
[h2] К сожалению есть и ложка дёгтя в этой бочке мёда [/h2]
[list]
    [*][i] Порог вхождения и интерфейс - как в любой 4х-стратегии это вызов для игрока. Разобраться в механиках игры может быть сложно. В игре есть обучение, но к сожалению оно не столь подробное и даже после его прохождения могут остаться вопросы. Интерфейс игры - это лабиринт из различных вкладок и информации (В том числе сокращений по типу ""5П"", которые не сразу будут ясны новому игроку.). На первый взгляд он выглядит запутанным, но со временем вы привыкнете к нему. К счастью, он не такой перегруженный как в Stellaris. [/i]
    [*][i] Искусственный интеллект - иногда принимает странные решения. К примеру, ты накопил много Пыли (Местная валюта), он может предложить отдать все. С какой радости? Но в целом, он достаточно умен, чтобы бросить вам вызов. [/i]
    [*][i] Дополнения к игре запишу скорее в минусы, так как выходят сомнительными через один. Особенно вызывают вопросы такие дополнения как - Supremacy и Awakening. Подробнее о них расскажу в отдельных обзорах. [/i]
[/list]

[b] Вывод: [/b] [i] Играя Endless Space 2 ты забываешь о времени и погружаешься в мир космических приключений. Как и в любой 4х-стратегии, ты можешь сесть за нее и спустя десяток часов осознать, что провел весь день в этом мире. Она не идеальна, но её достоинства с лихвой перекрывают недостатки. Некоторые недостатки можно исправить, к примеру починить ИИ, в мастерской есть моды, что отлично справляются с этим. Но если ты решил поиграть с друзьями, то этот недостаток не будет заметен вовсе. Если вы любите космос и стратегии, то Endless Space 2 - это ваш выбор <З [/i] | 戦闘は陣形を設定したらあとは見てるだけだがそれが良い

I binged this quite some time ago but never really returned to it too much. While I do recommend the game for the recipe editor alone, I'm not without a fair few criticisms of it.

[u]Yay:[/u]
[list]
[*]The recipe creator is intuitive, easy to follow, and really fun and satisfying. It was nice to see a restaurant tycoon where I could properly set the menu! Nice little creative avenue.
[*]Music is pretty cute! As is the design of the little chefs and waiters and such.
[*]The range of ingredients is really cool to explore.
[*]Good range of ideals to manage for certain demographics, which gives replay attraction.
[*]The employee task prioritisation tickled the organisation loving part of my brain.
[*]Loads of funny little prompts / references in game.
[/list]

[u]Nay:[/u]
[list]
[*]When I first started playing I found getting started brutal and had to look up tips just to survive more than a few days. It was a bit off putting.
[*]The UI can feel busy and a bit clunky to navigate, especially to new players.
[*]I have to say I do think the game is a bit...well...ugly. Sorry! I know it's not a driving point for the game but my logic is this - if you're allowing us the freedom to be creative with recipes, please let us be a bit more creative with designing our restaurants! It makes the game feel lopsided.
[*]I do think the price tag is too high to be honest... the overall experience is too shallow to warrant it.
[*]I think there could've been more work put into the events to make them a challenge rather than just visual noise.
[*]Almost all of the real appeal sits on the recipe editor. Once your restaurant gets flowing the novelty starts to die off and I find it hard to pick up this game for extended periods.
[/list]

[u]All in all…[/u]

I do think the game play is one sided and lots, if not all, of the appeal rides on the recipe editor, but it is a really fun game for that alone! I just can't help but feel like this could've been really special if there'd have been extra attention into providing more challenges later into the game, and more customisation to match the level of creativity available in the recipe editor. It feels like there was a lot of love put into that one aspect and the rest got glossed over or rushed.

Still, I do recommend giving it a go if you feel like you'd have fun hyper focusing on the menu! I would just perhaps wait for it to go on sale to get a better deal. | 我布置餐厅布置了半天，然后营业一直亏钱，是怎么回事呢？ | thats actualy my life | niceee!"

7/10. | There's fun to be had here but it's weighed down by a build system that is almost entirely RNG-based.

You collect gold, plus mana in each of several categories (obtained by your students studying that subject). When you get enough of a category you can draw a card for an item or new room of that category - you're presented with three options and pick one. These options are entirely RNG-based.

What that means is that you may go into a map thinking you want to try an Arcane and Nature school and then just never draw the requisite cards to get it going. Or, you may know you need more dormitories for your students but the game just never gives you the card. You can't really plan the school out because you really have no idea what the game is going to let you build with the bizarre luck-of-the-draw system.

On the plus side, there's a lot of charm in the graphics and the game does a great job with the ""feel"" of magic. The classrooms are cool and your kids can get items like devil's horns, staves, regalia, etc. It really does feel like a magic school.

It's just such an odd choice from the developers to make the build system completely based on dice rolls. | I love this game, the main campaign is perfect, there is some replay ability, if you like experimenting, I do. Definitely recommend, my only gripe is that I selfishly want more.

At a certain point i started playing endless, but I wish there was more story, unless I'm missing something, I wish there was a secret to uncover or the dungeons just available or for quests to keep coming. In endless mode it hits a lull, I'd like for there to be more action, maybe the factions go to war or something, see what happens if you and the certain groups are friends. See students join different factions and maybe that gives you influence during encounters because your student runs a specific department for that faction. I think fleshing out a little more story based details would make endless actually go on for a lot longer before hitting a lull. | 好玩但是很卡真的很卡，慎玩 | Great theme and art style.

Первые часов пять играть довольно интересно, приходится действительно над тактикой думать, выбирать кто пойдет на миссию. Но когда открывается минимальный необходимый гир, что происходит часу на 7, кривая сложности резко падает на дно и дальше ты просто катишься катком всё больше разгоняясь. Некроны вообще ничего не могут противопоставить пачке хотя бы из четырех жрецов и случайные ивенты наносят урона больше, чем все стычки с некронами за миссию в совокупности.

Случайные ивенты вообще мем в этой игре, зачастую даже выбора, который бы приводил к нейтральному или положительному исходу в комнатах нет, то есть это просто обвешивание вашей группы дебафами, чтобы вам было хоть немножко посложнее в финальном файте миссии.

Но главная проблема этой игры это тексты, в игре примерно 45 миссий, после и перед каждой из них вас обдают тугой струёй диалогов по типу
Магос Пупа: Нам нужно захватить эту жижу из гробницы ксеносов, магос 
Магос Лупа: Да, магос, мы обязаны изучить её!
Магос Запупа: НЕТ! Это грязные технологии, мы должны их сжечь!
Магос Лупа: Да, магос, все ксеносы умрут, магос!
Магос Пупа: Но писание учит, что всякое знание благо! Значит мы должны всё захватывать и изучать!
Магос Лупа: Да, магос, поиск знаний бесконечный процесс, мы захватим жижу!
Магос Запупа: Я протестую! „рандомная цитата“ Значит мы обязаны уничтожить жижу!
Магос Лупа: Да, магос, вы совершенно правы, магос!

И эта ахинея КАЖДЫЙ раз после и до миссий, по 10-15 реплик. При этом суть почти всех этих диалогов БУКВАЛЬНО как я описал, с поправкой на то, какой магос начинает ныть, про несчастных скитариев ли или про недостаточность снабжения. Сюжета же или лора там 0000,1%, поэтому во второй половине игры уже начинаешь просто скипать весь этот шум.

Вторая половина игры игра вообще жесточайше душит – некроны перестают давать хоть какой-то отпор, карты начинают повторяться, а видов миссий тут вообще только три на всю игру. Лишь сражения с боссами немного радуют и, как слабый свежий ветерок, выручают. Но боссов мало, игра идёт часов 30, а контента в ней часов на 8. | Fantastic visuals

Мирные космонавты должны выполнять задания для восстановления работоспособности корабля и выявлять предателей, чтобы избавиться от них. Саботажники же стремятся убить мирных игроков и саботировать системы корабля, оставаясь при этом незамеченными.

Игра сочетает элементы психологического триллера, где напряжение и подозрения постоянно нарастают, а ключевые обсуждения и разоблачения происходят на общих собраниях команды.[/i]

[b]Геймплей:[/b]
[i]Основная цель игры — выполнять задания или саботажи, а также выявлять и устранять предателей среди членов экипажа. Игроки делятся на две команды: члены экипажа и предатели. Члены экипажа должны выполнять задания, чтобы выиграть, в то время как предатели должны убивать других игроков и саботировать объекты, оставаясь при этом незамеченными.

Игровой процесс динамичен и требует от игроков постоянного взаимодействия и обсуждения. Задания разнообразны и требуют от игроков координации и логики. Саботажи могут значительно повлиять на ход игры, создавая дополнительные возможности для предателей.[/i]

[b]Графика и звук:[/b]
[i]Among Us отличается яркой и мультяшной графикой, которая привлекает внимание и создает дружелюбную атмосферу. Анимации плавные, а визуальные эффекты подчеркивают ключевые моменты игры. Звуковое сопровождение также на высоте: музыка и звуковые эффекты добавляют динамики и напряжения в ключевые моменты игры.[/i]

[b]Мультиплеер и взаимодействие:[/b]
[i]Одним из главных достоинств Among Us является возможность играть с друзьями и случайными игроками со всего мира. Игра поддерживает до 15 игроков на одной карте, что делает каждую сессию уникальной и насыщенной событиями. Голосовой чат позволяет игрокам обсуждать свои подозрения и координировать действия, что добавляет элемент социального взаимодействия.[/i]

Всем добра, удачи и приятной игры! ^_^[/i] | по факту игра для детей но там одна игра где все доверяют одному человеку а под конец он оказывается предателем это absolute cimena | 优化是没有的，备受辱骂是没有悔改的，外挂是一大堆的，创新是没有的，被抄了是不管的，真想不到这游戏是怎么活下来的 | [b]Among Us took the gaming world by storm, proving that sometimes, the simplest games create the most unforgettable moments. Whether you're completing tasks like a diligent crewmate or plotting deception as an imposter, this game is all about strategy, teamwork, and betrayal.

The gameplay is easy to understand but leads to intense, hilarious, and sometimes frustrating interactions. One moment, you're quietly fixing wires, and the next, you're passionately defending yourself in an emergency meeting after being falsely accused. The mix of deduction and deception makes every round unpredictable and fun.

What makes Among Us special is the social experience. It thrives on communication (and miscommunication), whether you're playing with friends or random players. The joy of convincing others to vote someone off, only to realize they were innocent, creates endless entertainment.

Visually, it's simple and colorful, with cute character designs that contrast the brutal reality of getting ejected into space. The sound design, from the satisfying task completion beeps to the ominous kill animations, adds to the tension.

While Among Us is at its best with a group of friends, public lobbies can be hit-or-miss, depending on how people play. The game has also evolved with new roles, maps, and customization options, keeping things fresh for long-time players.

In conclusion, Among Us is a fantastic party game that blends strategy and chaos in the best way possible. It’s proof that great multiplayer experiences don’t need complex mechanics—just a solid concept and the right group of people. If you love games that test friendships and create hilarious memories, this one’s a must-play![/b] |

Go play rimworld instead of this.

This game adds a lot to the rimworld formula and shows a lot of promise, but is somewhat hampered by its lack of quality of life features and endgame content/challenge.

It's been in EA forever and it doesn't feel any closer to release.

Nevertheless;

After 4 years of early access this game still has the most mediocre combat I've seen in a game like this. As the player there is very little you can do in combat to mitigate damage or play out combat strategically."

[h3] Personal experience: [/h3]
I spent over 5 hours in the game, and I can confidently say that it’s perfect for those looking to unwind and relax. The simplicity and minimalism of the game are top-notch. At first, I was surprised by how such a simple mechanic could be so captivating. Slowly, I started building islands, exploring their potential, and genuinely enjoying the process.
The game is a perfect way to relax. There’s no pressure; you simply build, develop, and enjoy the view. I found the way ecosystems come to life and how the island transforms into a vibrant world incredibly satisfying.

[b] Pros: [/b]
[list]
[*] Minimalist style: The visuals are light and pleasant, not overwhelming, yet still visually appealing.
[*] Easy to learn: The gameplay is simple to grasp, but it’s addictive and hard to stop playing.
[*] Calming and atmospheric: Perfect for those who want to relax and disconnect from the world.
[*] Building process: Watching your island grow and develop is a deeply immersive experience.
[/list]
[b] Cons: [/b]
[list]
[*] Limited content: The game can feel a bit repetitive over time, and while it leaves a good impression, you may crave more variety in mechanics.
[*] Lack of challenge: For those who prefer dynamic gameplay, the game might feel too laid-back and lacking in competitive elements.
[*] Short experience: Some players might find the game to be a bit too short and simple after a few hours.

ISLANDERS is an excellent game for those who appreciate a relaxing experience and want a break from intense projects. Despite its simplicity, it’s surprisingly addictive and allows you to create beautiful islands. If you enjoy calm gameplay and don’t mind a short but enjoyable experience, this game is definitely for you!
[b] My rating: 8/10 [/b]
[i] I recommend it to anyone who’s looking for a peaceful, laid-back experience without expecting complex mechanics. [/i] | [u][b]ISLANDERS[/b][/u] is a serene and tranquil procedurally-generated, endless, score-based puzzle game which has a city-building theme to it. Although its tagline states that it is ""A minimalist city builder,"" this is slightly misleading because the city-building aspect is moreso an aesthetic rather than a core identity of the gameplay since it doesn't involve resource or population management like the more traditional city-building games and is also less predictable due to the randomness of the maps and some of the building layouts.

Overall, I recommend the game as it is very relaxing to play casually for an hour or two here and there, while simultaneously having just enough depth to satiate score-chasers, and the procedural generation of the maps constantly challenges you to adapt to the random terrain and natural features that you are provided. Although I don't care to compete for high scores, I found that attempting to optimize my cities was unexpectedly fun and especially gratifying after planning the general layout of my city and watching the points come flooding in as my plan came to fruition.

Note: this review is current as of the unnumbered patch released on 23 November 2023 which is the latest update.

[quote][b]S U M M A R Y[/b][/quote]

- The gameplay is very accessible to a wide range of players as it is simple and intuitive enough for casual players, yet also has enough depth to challenge score-chasers, but the game is very minimalistic and offers little to no precision when it comes to building an efficient and aesthetically-pleasing city;
- The replay value is decent and the game is fun when played occasionally in shorter sessions but the core gameplay loop will get repetitive very quickly;
- The graphics are vibrant, almost cartoonish, and are reminiscent of the ""Chibi"" art style;
- The soundtrack is composed of relaxing ambient music with rural-style sound effects to give the feeling of an authentic city; and
- There is no story whatsoever but a casual puzzle game like this doesn't have a need for one.

The game has 38 achievements, most of which will be acquired throughout casual gameplay while a few will require you to go out of your way to set them up but aren't difficult by any means and should take less than 10 hours to achieve; however, the [i]Conqueror[/i] achievement will take at least 30 hours by itself and require you to become very familiar with the mechanics of the game while also planning the general layout of each map before placing any buildings. That being said, it isn't nearly as RNG-dependent as many complaints on the Steam Discussion forums would lead you to believe as you merely have to invest some time into the game to learn it beyond a casual level since the achievement is not a given whatsoever.

[hr][/hr]
[quote][b]R E V I E W[/b][/quote]

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
The gameplay is more akin to a puzzle game rather than a traditional city builder because of its focus on simplicity and minimalism: a map is procedurally-generated, you are given a choice between two random sets of buildings, and your inventory is populated with a number of buildings from the chosen set. Your goal is to place the buildings efficiently in order to receive point bonuses from other types of buildings and meet the point threshold which gives you another choice between two more random sets of buildings. This process repeats itself until you either fail to meet the point threshold, by having no more buildings to place, or meet the threshold which allows you to travel to the next map and restart the gameplay loop, ad infinitum.

As far as casual play is concerned, the game is simple and intuitive enough to get into and occasionally have fun with in small spurts. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for those who like to chase high scores because the game demands absolute precision when placing buildings and planning out your city but offers you very few tools to facilitate this need and the tools that do exist are quite shoddy. For example, there is somewhat of an integrated ""snap-to"" ability but it is finnicky and rarely lines up buildings perfectly with one another which can lead to inefficiencies and cause you to lose points -- and sometimes those few points could be the difference between losing a run altogether or proceeding to the next map.

Sometime between 2019 and 2022, the game was handed over to an entirely new development team and they added the more difficult achievements which require a certain level of precision that the game simply can't offer and this makes the minimalist approach of the game feel almost incongruous with, and somewhat inadequate for, these new achievements (one of which is the infamous [i]Conqueror[/i] achievement). If they had made the existing snapping more accurate, added an option to turn on a grid, or gave you a laser level tool, then the game would be feel much more precise but you can definitely tell the difference between the two development teams' philosophy on achievements.

Another minor gripe that I have with the overly-minimalist approach is that the House, Mansion, and Park buildings also have a variety of different layouts (similar to Tetris blocks) but the next one is randomly chosen for you and can't be changed which is irritating from an efficiency perspective and true city-building aspect but I can't complain too much about it because it fits the minimalist design approach that they were going for.

Nevertheless, I still found it quite fun to learn the more intricate nuances to the game's mechanics and optimize my cities; however, once I figured out the most efficient setup then the most fun part became the planning of the city and playing the actual game for long periods of time became a bit of a chore which is why I think that it's a good game to occasionally have fun with in smaller doses because it gets repetitive very quickly.

The game also has a Sandbox Mode where you can unleash your creative side  with an unlimited supply of all buildings and a Photo Mode where you can take fancy images of said creations using a variety of built-in filters and tools.

[h3]Graphics[/h3]
The graphics are vibrant and almost cartoonish in nature which gives it a very charming look. The buildings are also blocky but in a cute and bubbly sort of way -- if anything, I'd say that its art style actually resembles the popular ""Chibi"" art style because of how cute, minimalistic, and caricature-like the art design is. The second development team also added a number of optional seasonal and holiday themes that you can apply to your game to spruce things up at your whim which is a nice touch.

[h3]Sound[/h3]
The soundtrack is made up of relaxing ambient music with scenic noises such as dogs barking, birds chirping, and other rural sound effects. The music is so modest that I'm not even sure if the audio tracks would count as ""songs"". Much like the graphics, there are a number of optional seasonal and holiday-themed songs that you can enable or disable but I frankly couldn't even tell the difference between any of the songs. All-in-all, it's just a very relaxing soundtrack which I would say resembles white noise to some degree. The sound effects are few and far between but the main one you will hear is placing a building which makes a very satisfying plopping sound.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]
Overall, I recommend the game because you can easily relax to it for an hour and forget about the stressors of life as you get immersed in its soothing audio, charming visuals, and straightforward and leisurely nature. If you're more of a score-chaser then it's surprisingly fun and engaging to plan out your city, optimize the placement of your buildings, and get that feeling of elation as your plan flourishes and you watch your points soar. | ISLANDERS is a beautifully minimalist city-building game that’s perfect for relaxing and flexing your creativity. The simple mechanics focus on strategic placement of buildings, offering a satisfying mix of puzzle and strategy elements. The colorful, procedurally generated islands are gorgeous, and each new map feels like a fresh canvas for your ideas.

While the game doesn’t offer endless depth or complexity, its simplicity is part of its charm. It’s great for short sessions or unwinding after a long day. For its price, it’s an excellent indie gem and a must-play for fans of chill city builders. | Маленькая, но приятная и медитативная. Функционал не большой.

The devs are only adding more and more content, each improving to the game and adding more challenges. | After nearly 20 hours of playing in the last few days, I think it's safe to say I like this game.

Not because it's a colony sim. I've played my fair share of citybuilders and logistics management games and, while Timberborn does a perfectly competent job at that, it isn't what makes the game truly special (at least not for me).

Because what do beavers do? They build dams. So what would super-intelligent beavers in a post-apocalyptic future do? Why, they'd build massive water engineering projects, of course.

That, for me, is the main selling point of the game and what really sets it apart from similar colony builders: your survival depends on managing water, which means building dams and floodgates and levees and sluices  to direct and control its flow. You use water to keep your farmland irrigated, keep your drinking tanks filled, and to power your industry. Water is your lifeblood, it is your everything - so manage it well.

Oh - and just to check, you've got an alternate flow solution for the upcoming Badtide, right? Don't get *too* comfortable just cuz you got your irrigation sorted out.

Timberborn lives on its beautiful modelling of water flow, so much so that it made me read up on fluid dynamics to really understand the nitty gritty of how water speed, volume and pressure all interact with each other. If you want to play a game that indirectly teaches you how Bernoulli's principle works, get Timberborn. (I'll just add that to the list of 'sentences I never thought I'd type'.) | I had to uninstall this game. I don't even play city builders! Why am I putting so much time and energy into this game!?

If you want a time sync play this game. It's a delightful way to spend your time and it's pretty low stakes. Just make sure you follow the tutorial steps early because I've found the most likely point for your colony to die is very early. Once it's up and running you might screw it up and kill off half your beavers but it's kinda difficult to kill off so many that the colony entirely collapses.

Oh, and prioritize simple foods and water above all other jobs. So long as your colonists have those they survive. They might not be happy but grumpy and alive is better than dead.

Anyway, play it. Good game. 8/10. Now I'm going to uninstall it before I lose another two working weeks of my life to it. | 　取り敢えずプレイ時間1,600ちょい、ワンダー発動１回ほどしか遊んでいないニワカプレイヤーの戯言です。

76561198032898393,1102190,Monster Train,16.6,Strategy,15,"Monster Train is a deck-building game. It's following in the footsteps of other great games like Slay the Spire. As a result, I will be comparing this game to Slay the Spire a lot.

In Monster Train, you defend a train full of (you guessed it) monsters. You fight a series of battles, with each battle involving a bunch of minor enemies followed by a major (boss) enemy. In-between battles you do some deck construction using various stations. One run takes about 60 to 90 minutes.

I've gotten 85 hours of fun out of this game.

THE GOOD:
- Monster Train is a really fun card battler.
- The train level mechanic, where you have 4 different levels in your train, adds a lot of strategic depth and novelty.
- You can always refuse a new card or artifact, something I always wished I could do in Slay the Spire—which would force me to take cards I didn't want and then make it really hard to get rid of them.
- It's also easier to remove cards you don't want, often allowing you to craft the deck you want by the endgame.
- The game lets you know who the major bosses are at the very start of the run. This allows you to build your deck accordingly.
- Great variety of enemies, cards, and special abilities.
- Great learning curve, as new concepts are gradually introduced so you don't have to drink from a firehose of knowledge.
- Nice graphics and music.

THE BAD:
- There is no real story to the game. There's kind of the veneer of a story, but it doesn't really explain why you need to do multiple runs.
- Even with the better control over your deck than other games in the genre, you are still at the mercy of the random number generator. It can be frustrating to lose because you never found the cards you needed, or because of a terrible draw for an otherwise great deck.
- The game developers claim this game is a roguelike, but it's not really. You play to unlock new features, which is a good tutorial mechanic, but to be a roguelike the game should require you to learn by failing. I won on my second attempt.

THE UGLY:
- In this game the protagonists are the demons of Hell, and you actually fight against Heavenly angels. This doesn't bother me, but you might find it offensive.
- When using a mouse and dragging a card to play it, if you linger the game can automatically scroll up to a level above. This is a great way to ruin your battle by playing the card on the wrong level!
- The game enables you to ramp up the difficulty with a feature called the Covenant. This is ostensibly a good thing that gives the game some extra life and challenge. Unfortunately, in trying to find a variety of ways to increase the difficulty the game designer has mainly made the game more annoying. They add lots of junk cards to your deck and make it harder to remove those cards. Hence, rather than ending with a bang, the game kind of fizzled out with a whimper as I got increasingly frustrated and quit.
 | I'll be honest. I didn't like it that much. Primarily because the game at higher difficults devolves into gigagbuffing one monster to solo the final boss. Still though learning the game was great. | I played this roguelite cards battler on various platforms, gamepass pc ,xbox and steam, and its a great game. Fun. 
For me the progression of the game is really good, while you play more you unlock fun other stuff. The combinations are a blast, you can make over the top OP cards. I like the sounds when the train is totaly full and your cards all packed with buffs, the sound is not beautiful, but catching, and I like the raw sound of the abilities clashing into each other.
Its cool and easy to play some rounds, make comobs and have fun.
Game is fun and well made, for sure worth your time

 | I stand by my early impressions that the UI clashes terribly in this game. For context, I've played and love Slay the Spire, and I THOUGHT I'd like Monster Train, but I thought it was kind of ugly...I admit I wasn't in the mood to give it a fair shake, and it is now starting to click with me. It's good, but not great, with tremendous replay value. | High Quality Time Deleting Machine. I have hundreds of hours on mobile as well. Base game is good but I recommend getting Wurmkin DLC as well. Unfortunately, not nearly enough Steam Community additions and sorely needs additional characters, cards, and artifacts."

This game's definitely on the complex side - you're juggling heroes, hero abilities, perks, managing your town's economy, defences, picking the right weapons, and trying to survive massive waves of monsters all at once. Sometimes I found myself staring at all my options thinking ""what the heck do I do here?"" But overall, the depth made it more fun for me.

There is a mode called 'Boundless' which is perfect for players like me who don't want to bang their head against the wall with tough RNG and the rogue-like aspect where you're expected to die. It makes your heroes stronger by allowing additional perks on maps and gives you more control over your runs by limiting weapon drops. If you're not super into the whole rogue-lite ""lose everything and start over"" thing, this mode's great. It's like a more chill way to play without losing what makes the game special.

I had a great time with it overall. If you're into tactical games and don't mind a bit of complexity, definitely give this one a shot. Just know that there's a lot to learn at first, but the game gives you ways to make it easier if you want. | I hated this game, then I loved it, then I hated it, then I loved it, I still hate it ... but I love it. 

When I first Launched the game, I was too hasty to judge it (I was in a dark spot with gaming). I hated the UI I hated the overload of info I hated the unclear visuals and was just overall frustrated, then - after calming down - I gave it another shot while changing settings to better appeal to my playstyle and boy was I in for a surprise, this game was absolutely amazing with even amazinger music (made by The Algorithm) a band I already like.
With that being said I feel the game overdoes it a lot with the difficulty and RNG, sometimes regardless of what you do you will fail and a game that takes this long to play and isn’t a simple pick-up-and-play it gets VERY tedious, coupled with some very random upgrades and perks for your heroes that it just loses its appeal fast, what I mean by that is in spite of being a kind of rogue-lite it is not at all easy to pick up and play. 
I almost quit on Elderlicht (the 4th map) because it stopped being fun failing run after run after run getting lame perks with lame weapons and lame heroes and over-tuned elites all at the same time but I pushed through and OH boy was completing this game cathartic, I feel like such a weight lifted off my shoulders.

游戏是好玩的,但我不喜欢. | TL;DR: amazing but with some major caveats!

This game scratched a major itch that has been roughing up my existence since I beat xcom2 for like the 5th time. It hits a lot of the same beats with a super challenging and engaging tactical game paired with a great base-building/hero progression mode. The art is fun, the character development is satisfying, and the loop! .. the loop is super compelling. It's so fun to kill monsters, and then want to improve your characters, and then buy stuff, and then build static defenses, and then want to kill monsters all over again. 

It probably dances ever-so-slightly towards the TOO much decision making side in the base phase -- i often spend MORE time there rather than actually slaying undead. But on the flip side, there are so many lever, options, and decisions to fine tune & get the best out of what you're provided with (randomized level ups, found items, etc.)

I've put in over a hundred hours so this is easily a game i've spent the most time in in the past.. decade? So. it's really good. It's really, really good. I might marry it. No, you marry it. Whatever. Someone should marry it.

However, here are a few minor, minor gripes:
- you kind of find the weapons you like (or are the most strong) and then you stick with that and ignore all the other ones
- the difficulty curve goes up by a pretty big degree at the boss stage. so you can easily lose the whole run (6-10 cycles) because you realise at the end that you're behind the dmg curve, or worse, have the wrong skills developed
- the fights themselves, as fun as the gameplay is, become very same-y, in general the later mechanics are harder but less fun
- oh, one time my save corrupted and couldn't be played anymore. i had to restart from the very beginning. that was crappy.

UPDATE: i just hit the last stage/level and as above, the game continued it's habit of making the 'twists' less and less fun. This time it's a random effect that can one-shot an early hero with NOTHING you can do it about it. The only saving grace (Since you can't save in this game) -- is ALT-F4 to lose all progress on that day or night.. but better than starting the whole stage again. BRUTAL.

sub-note: i realise that as great as this game is, i will never play it again. So 100+ hrs is GREAT value, but i'll never replay this game.. unlike my game-soulmate, xcom. | Not played anything else quite like it. Turn based tower defence with nice pixel art and an awesome soundtrack. I wont go into details about the gameplay as you can find better sources for that, but theres a good amount of meat there without being unneccesarily complicated if you have some experience in TB games.

Took me 120 hours to beat base game levels on standard difficulty. I spent some time trying out different base building tactics and weapon combos, and Im not the sort to min max but it seems to me every weapon (which gives the heroes their move set and are swappable) is viable on base difficulty, although hand crossbow is OP. Base building is more simple, but theres a few different ways you can go and perks (Omens) you can take to focus on one strategy or another.

Will be watching Ishtar in the future, this was something unique and well thought out that I'll probably come back to.

This game gets significantly more fun the more you view it as a puzzle game rather than a city planning game. You are not trying to build a nice place to live. Instead, you are trying to funnel the right cars to the right places in whatever way works best. This leads you into some city designs which would make absolutely no sense in a normal city builder, but looking at it as a puzzle game, this is not a problem whatsoever.

The cars will always go the fastest route, and always deploy from the nearest available house, so you don't need to do any management at all other than setting up the roads and trying to plan it so that there isn't gridlock.

В остальном игра топ, баланс конечно иногда может кинуть подлянку, когда появляются не те цвета где ты их ждешь или неожиданно квадрат в круг превращается. Но в классическом режиме можно все удалять и менять, там проблем особо нет(только ЕБАНН**ЫЙ МУМБАЙ, я на нем для 2000 поездок перепроходил раза 4, причем каждый раз результат был все ближе и ближе к желаемому результату, перед успехом получилось на 1996 закрыть, чуть не сгорел). Могу дать совет трофихантерам - на некоторых картах 2000 проще выбить через челенджи чем через классику. Полезность улучшений зависит от карты, иногда лучше взять светофор или круг, нежели шоссе или мост. Но это вы уже на своем опыте сможете узнать. 
В общем игра топ, и для отдыха подойдет и подумать и погореть, выбивая ачивки, можно. Я очень доволен покупкой, мне больше понравилась эта игра, чем про метро, она более честная в плане сложности. | ---{ Graphics }---

76561198032898393,1145340,Rogue State Revolution,3.8833333333333333,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",1,"Graphics are nice, Gameplay is nice. This game has a lot of identity which is super nice, but as far as i am concerned it has a lot of bugs that can make you lose without your fault, you can produce double the energy you need and still have blackouts, factories randomly not producing goods (in my case it was procesed food and it went from above 200 to 0 in one turn), it's such a shame that such a good idea as mix of democracy and civilization, with rogue lite mechanics setteled in middle east to be broken, apparently devs abandoned this game and the studio propably has problems existing | На удивление приятная игра, которую с удовольствием прошёл несколько раз, включая сверхмаксимальный уровень сложности. Начнём с того, что может не понравится некоторым игрокам:
1. Игра точно мотивирует пройти её несколько раз, при том, что она является сюжетной. Мотивирует ачивками, открытием новых министров, бонусами на следующие прохождения, невозможностью увидеть всё за один раз. Могут ли там быть разные концовки? Да, немного разные концовки могут быть, в зависимости от некоторых решений в процессе президентства, но вариантов их там не много. Игра в любом случае, закончится после двух президентских сроков [spoiler](если быть совсем точным, второй раз выиграть выборы придётся для достижения хотя бы относительно позитивного итога, но третий срок отсиживать уже не придётся из-за определённого ключевого события, которое случится буквально через несколько месяцев после второй победы на выборах)[/spoiler], поэтому сравнивать её с политическими бесконечными песочницами совершенно нельзя. С другой стороны, у меня не было ощущения, что я хочу продолжить дальше, то есть мне было интересно ровно до того момента, когда как раз концовка и наступает - именно в этот момент понимаешь, что хочешь закончить. Так что какой-никакой приятный баланс тут соблюдён, просто не факт, что всем игрокам захочется играть многократно.
2. Игра не представляет собой слишком глубокую симуляцию политических процессов, то есть не стоит ждать от неё чего-то масштабов «Tropico». Но в то же время она не представляет собой и быстро надоедающий симулятор иконок, связей и табличек, вроде «Democracy», где подвигал всё везде в нужную тебе сторону и радуйся - смысла в ней сидеть дольше часа больше нет. Игра и тут успешно балансирует где-то между... поэтому может не зайти любителям либо одного, либо другого. Она не пытается быть серьёзной, но она может быть такой. Она не пытается быть хардкорной, но называть её казуальной - язык не поворачивается.

Теперь то, что точно может быть приятно в этом политическом симуляторе:
1. В нём требуется балансировать между разными регионами страны, где могут быть сильно разные люди с разными потребностями. Учитывая то, что игра каждое новое прохождение генерирует карту (да, карта там не статичная - она при каждой новой игре будет немного разной, её генерацию можно настраивать: другие ресурсы, другие ключевые точки, другое физическое состояние страны, другие опасные места, другие соседи и тому подобное), то регионы тоже могут поменяться. Смотришь налево - там огромный сельхозрегион с лугами и сёлами, где верят в странную местную религию; смотришь в центр - там небольшой урбанизированный регион с огромными городами, где преобладает уже образованное либеральное городское население; смотришь направо - там вообще горный регион, где население преимущественно составляет этническое меньшинство, которое вообще не против отделиться от страны, вот только там у них выход к морю и главный порт в стране... И, при каждой генерации, подобные региональные вызовы меняются. И, если уж не всех этих разных людей с разными желаниями, то хотя бы большинство, надо удовлетворить к выборам, иначе не победить.
2. Механики и геймплей достаточно масштабны, чтобы их можно было похвалить: тут таблицы и графики, ползунки бюджетов и прочие элементы, которые любят хардкорщики; тут и строительство ключевых зданий и нужных местах, прокладка дорог и транспортная логистика, любимые градостроителями; тут и постоянные политические дилеммы, которые надо разрешать, так любимые казуальщиками. Кажется, игра пыталась сесть сразу на все стулья. И, кажется, у неё даже получилось, потому что ничего из этого нет так много, чтобы задушить. Оно всё как-то органично сменяет друг друга на экране игрока.
3. Игра изобилует разными необычными фишками: видеовставки, некоторый юмор, невероятные случайные события... всё это дополнительного разноображивает геймплей и механики, которые и без того, достаточно широки. Настолько широки, что в некоторых вещах стоит даже поискать гайды или спрашивать у игравшего друга, что делать.

Итог: я однозначно могу сказать, что игра мне понравилась и видно, как разработчики старались наполнить её контентом. И, пусть она не получилась масштабов глобальных стратегий от «Paradox», где игроки запускают сотни разных каток и сидят в них тысячи часов, игра правда может иногда напомнить о себе и заставить пройти новую катку. Было бы даже интересно посмотреть, что бы получилось у разработчиков, если бы у них были бюджеты и сроки на создание глобальной стратегии. Я бы с удовольствием такое увидел. На фоне позитивных эмоций от игры тонут некоторые ошибки локализации, не очень удобное управление войсками и редкие вылеты, но не сказать про это, не могу (пусть те, кто сочтёт нужным прочесть этот обзор, будут в курсе их наличия). Но эта игра заслужила, чтобы я проигнорировал огрехи и играл несколько раз, потому что она хотела быть не такой, как все. Я не знаю, придутся ли кому-то всё эти креативы по душе ещё, но игра точно достойна ознакомления с ней и покупки (тем более на неё бывают огромные скидки по 80%). | Overly complicated slide juggler and builder that feels more like whack-a-mole than a 4x strategy. | Best. Cutscenes. Ever.

Really interesting albeit a little tedious at times strategy game too.

Honestly, after completing a run. It's buggy, but it's still one of the best art pieces of gaming I've ever seen. Seeing that its been sold off is absolutely depressing. | Egy kellemes kis agyhalott Szaddam, Khadafi, stb szimulátor. Néhány ponton olyan rossz, hogy az már jó! Ne várj tőle sokat és fizess érte sokat! (mondjuk alapból sem olyan nagy az ára!) És elég jól visszaadja a harmadik világ abszurditásának érzését."

I played through the whole thing on deck and it's totally doable, but definitely play it with a keyboard if you can. I'd recommend this to anyone. | Reading the story is funny but could also be very long and patience is needed. The censoring/advertisement playing is close to reality but the screen switching could be confusing sometimes, like i don't know how the points will be added. | Gute Idee, schlecht umgesetzt

Anfangs fand ich Not for Broadcast spannend, aber schnell wurde es nur noch frustrierend. 
Die Story-Sequenzen bestehen aus unglaublich viel Text, der Aufbau dessen hat mich so gelangweilt, dass ich keine Lust hatte, den Text überhaupt richtig zu lesen.
Das Gameplay im Studio war anfangs spaßig, wurde aber durch ständige Sabotage (div. unrealistische Szenarios) einfach nur lästig.
Man konnte der Story kaum folgen, weil man zu sehr mit Kameras, Frequenzen und Zensur beschäftigt ist. 
Mit dem Humor konnte ich persönlich auch nichts anfangen (aber das ist ja Geschmackssache).
Vielleicht ist der Story-Modus entspannter, aber dann fehlt für mich persönlich die Herausforderung.
Für mich hat es einfach nicht funktioniert... | 在玩法设计和内容制作上都很有趣，无论是电视节目还是其中一些音乐的成分都能看出有意去模仿真正的电视频道，导播的工作模拟的很好，以至于现在看一些节目会开始关注镜头的切换。不足之处则是有时操作太过手忙脚乱以至于无法专注电视节目和游戏剧情，有些无关紧要的剧情反而又没什么需要操作的东西，以及主角的家人线纯粹是选择题，没有什么提示，也无法给人留下太过深入的印象，主角各种操作对自己的职业未曾造成影响，也给人一种为故事发展而刻意安排的观感。但总体来说和国家晚间新闻度过的几个小时已经能够将主要角色的形象，以及两个政党的荒诞塑造的都还不错，结局时再一次听到熟悉的报幕，居然也感到了一些感动……虽然大概率不会多周目，对我来说这种构思有趣设定新颖的游戏，无论如何很有体验的价值。 | I was inspired to play this after watching Jacksepticeye play the first couple of levels.

Short premise: I did not know the original boardgame and never played it. The problem , to me, is NOT that they give few contents for 4 euros, I think that's OK and no probs with that. Simply, I was hoping in a smoother, easier to understand and more balanced game, which I did not find.
Why I didn't like the game: 
1) the interface is over-crunchy, awkward to say the least, as noted by some other reviewers. Each phase, it is not easy to understand what to do, or how to do it. Dead phases are not skipped. Way too many windows with info that you might or not use. Very confusing overall.
2) The mechanics: where's the tactics when essentially the best thing you can do is stack as many units you can in the same hex to build firepower? No point in dividing forces, no point in trying to encircle. Also, very dice-dependent, a bad roll spoils everything very easily, or you have to hope for a good roll in many situations else you're stuck/dead. If you're moving and they ambush you (they do, almost automatic), you're done, pinned, can't continue moving in that phase, can't shoot back in that phase, nothing. I didn't like pretty much anything of the game mechanics.

76561198032898393,1207650,Suzerain,0.0,"Adventure, Indie, RPG",0," Suzerain é um dos melhores jogos políticos de escolha já desenvolvidos, ainda que esse gênero não tenha muitos representantes (o que é uma pena). Se considerarmos um simulador político mais modernizado e próximo de Suzerain, podemos citar [i]Democracy 4[/i] por conta de sua profundidade na área política; no entanto, o grande problema desse jogo é que sua jogabilidade se resume a equilibrar números, sem oferecer uma experiência imersiva nas decisões políticas (sem desmerecer o jogo, ele até que é bom). Em Suzerain, por outro lado, o impacto das escolhas é genuinamente sentido, criando uma pressão real ao tomar todas as decisões, pois a maioria delas possui consequências significativas num futuro talvez muito próximo. É uma obra que desafia sua visão ideológica, se está disposto a seguir ela até o fim sem esperar consequências graves.

 Em determinado momento, precisei tomar uma decisão difícil para manter as contas do governo positivas, o que exigiu cortes no orçamento de um ministério. Fui duramente criticado e, ao aprofundar-me no problema, precisei escolher com ainda mais precisão qual setor interno sofreria a redução de recursos – ambos de grande importância. A experiência transmite de forma autêntica os dilemas enfrentados na administração pública, sendo tentador, em alguns momentos, ceder à tentação de ignorar o equilíbrio fiscal e gastar sem restrições (Olá, Lula da Silva).

 O jogo é inteiramente baseado em texto, estando disponível apenas em inglês e sem previsão de uma tradução muito fiel ao jogo, adotando uma linguagem formal condizente com o contexto político e institucional. Embora não seja impossível de entender, é comum recorrer a um tradutor para compreender plenamente os diálogos, já que cada interação fornece informações cruciais para a tomada de decisões estratégicas para a nação. Como pretendo seguir carreira em Relações Internacionais, Suzerain se mostra uma excelente introdução ao vocabulário político e diplomático em inglês (língua base), tornando-se um ótimo ponto de partida para aprofundar meu conhecimento na área. É uma mina de ouro para mim. | This is a Visual Novel with a Political theme to it, not an actual Political Simulator. Once you've accepted that, it's a very good Visual Novel about building the ""Story"" of the character you take charge of.

If you come in with the expectation that you'll be able to do your own thing the way you want them to, like any PoliSim, then prepare to be disappointed. Choices are limited to a select number of options with little degree of variance and you can only tackle issues as they come up, as the story demands. You do not have the ability to proactively decide when or how to handle various issues because as mentioned before, this is a Visual Novel, not a Political Simulator.

As a Visual Novel, is it any good? It's okay, but nothing extraordinary. More variety in routes and endings stemming from past choices would make this more memorable, but the variations are only mild, enough to see some change,  but not significant enough to completely alter the trajectory. That, and the story has tendencies to throw ""gotcha"" moments near the end that force you to steer your character in a specific direction very early on unless you like repeating the same ending for a dozen playthroughs.

TL;DR get it on sale | Game was a bit of a disappointment after my first time through. You are given very limited options to actually govern your nation in a successful way. How does investing in your economy do so little to stimulate it? Why are you not given the opportunity to campaign and lobby for re-election in any meaningful way? It's as if every thing is pre-decided to stop you from governing in a way that isn't exactly one or two paths.

- The economic part is confusing, no clear indicator of growth trend and limited policy tool, everything seems fine then suddenly you are in a deep recession
- While it's a good thing to have many in-game geopolitical events that mirror the 20th century in our world, it breaks my suspension of disbelief when there's a cold war stand off between the East and West, a League of Nations/UN like international organization, but there are no fictional WWI and WWII equivalent that leads to such scenario just like in our world.

That's thanks to the challenge mode, which tasks you to replay the game multiple times with a certain gamerule. It can be that your guns have one bullet, your throwables kill on impact, or you can only use your katana, which ""remixes"" the experience in an interesting way.

76561198032898393,1239080,Door Kickers 2: Task Force North,12.783333333333333,"Action, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",0,"After a couple of years in early access, Door Kickers 2 version 1.0 is finally out. I could let the number of hours I have speak for themselves but I believe the game deserves more than a few words. So here's my in depth review of DK2.
 
Organic, demanding, engaging, sometimes frustrating but always rewarding, Door Kickers 2 is a very special game with a unique, addictive gameplay and compelling mechanics that offers hours upon of hours of fun.

-Organic because the game feels very open and never holds your hand. You're never restricted in how you want to play or at which pace. There's no grid or action points. There's always more than one way to solve a problem. There is no clear-cut, right or wrong answer to complete a mission, and usually no two runs of a mission will be the exact same. No matter what squad you choose to play or how you approach a situation, the game never discourages you from doing so. Most of the environment is destructible and with the right tools you can create new paths through walls and fences. There's about eight different ways you can interact and breach doors and gates. Overall, the game's organic nature brings a kind of complexity and depth that's hard to find anywhere else.

-Demanding and engaging in the sense that the game is highly interactive and gives you a high level of control over your units : you manage and think from the point of view of every troop you control in relation to each other. Constant involvement from the player is required and there's always interesting and complex decisions to be made ; you have to deal with a lot of moving pieces. Whether it comes to gear loadout or squad composition, the way you approach a map and overall the amount of things to consider, the game can get pretty cerebral, to say the least. The vast flexibility of actions it offers makes for a meticulous yet engaging exercise in planning and experimentation. It offers a level of tactical and strategic freedom that boggles the mind with possibilities. The game also has a way of simulating the chaos and uncertainty of combat and makes the players think on their feet and adapt to changing situations. The overall experience can definitly feel overwhelming and straight up taxing in the first few hours, and the learning process can be painful, but it's worth pushing on. 

It can also feel overly complex and micro-management intensive, especially in the begining, because everything happens on the micro level in DK. But I will say this : micro is the price to pay for precision and higher level of control. Now don't get me wrong, you can always throw your troops in a general direction and hope for the best, but in my opinion the game starts to really shine once you learn to manage your troops efficiently. For example, you will notice that bumping the muzzle of a rifle into a wall will make that trooper compress his gun. There will be a delay until he's ready and able to engage a possible threat. This second is enough to cost that soldier's life, and possibly the whole squad after that. This is preventable by adding one or two more commands to his path or by simply chosing a shorter gun that can manoeuvre better in close quarters. Precise CQB movement and more complex formations will also require more input from the player to be effective. There's a lot more situations like this where ""micro-ing"" will give you an edge in combat and these little things become noticeable with playtime. It might feel tedious at first but I can assure you that it gets faster with practice and playtime. Don't expect high RTS levels of click rates but it can get pretty busy especially since most actions are done with the mouse and keybinds are rare.

-Sometimes frustrating because the game has an element of randomness which in a way, I find to also be addicting. Arguably, it also adds replayability. You can run the same plan mutiple times and you'll notice that sometimes you'll win a gunfight, sometimes you won't. Want that clean run challenge where nobody gets injured at the end of a mission? It won't always be up to you and it won't always 'feel' fair. You don't do any of the shooting after all ( for the most part ). Sometimes you can do everything right and still lose. Now don't get me wrong, despite some things being out of the players control, the game is still very much skill based. Some people consistently suck at XCOM, others are consistently good. Are they just lucky? No, they understand the game and they're skilled at it, despite its RNG aspect. I'd argue this also applies to DK. You will probably remember the times where it was against you more than the times it was in your favor. 
Weapon choice and most importantly tactics will give you the edge you need to win gunfights : it's about putting the odds on your side. The game makes you responsible for most of the actions of your troops and so it's completely on you to keep them alive. For example if you expect engagements to be at a certain range you can equip different weapons, scopes and ammunition accordingly or you can try a different approach. I think a lot of new players won't like this side of the game because it can make gunfights feel like a coin toss, depending on how you play of course. After a while, you are able to feel when you're going to lose or win an engagement. Also, remember that ""chaos and uncertainity of combat"" part? Well, this is part of the game. You either learn to enjoy it or you go back to playing chess like the nerd you are.

-Rewarding because almost every decision you make has a direct impact on gameplay. The game is challenging and the feeling that comes with finally completing that complex hostage rescue operation in a surgical way or a bomb defusal mission against all odds really is something special. It has that capacity to make you feel like a tactical mastermind when you finally overcome an obstacle by thinking out of the box and being creative. Or when you get that flank or that perfect synchronized entry into a building. Figuring out and overcoming some of the toughest maps the game has to offer is a unique experience that's hard to forget. I also find the game has a certain beauty to it when you manage to get perfect coordination and cohesion between your squad. Watching that feels like a highly choreographed dance when everything just clicks and flows.

Although the game might appear simple or casual at first sight for many, DK2 has quite a learning curve and skill ceiling. It is accessible and easy to get into but the more you play the more you'll find that the small things matter and have an impact on gameplay. The game has many subtleties and nuances but also depth that start to reveal themselves once you get the hang of it. I'm still learning little things and improving after my time in it. I highly recommend new players to not skip the tutorials and come back to it if necessary. 

I have a lot more to say about the game but steam won't let me, so here's my conclusion.

When it comes to engaging tactical combat, rewarding gameplay and organic planning, it doesn't get better than Door Kickers 2. It's a dream game for me and there's just nothing else like it. Everything mentionned in this review makes for a compelling, polished, high quality strategy/tactical action game with insane replayability and hours upon hours of interesting gameplay and near infinite amount of content. It scratches that military-tacticoolness-door-kicking-CQB itch like no other game can and I still find it engaging, exciting and fresh everytime I launch it. CQB lovers, tactical masterminds and larpers alike will feel right at home in this indie masterpiece.

For a game made by a very small team I think this is a big success and something they can be extremely proud of. This title is an underated gem and I hope it will have a long life ahead. I can't recommend it enough.

Time to say goodbye. ( check my maps and my YT channel ) | The fact that they've basically had a full game for the past couple years then hit us with the ""But wait! There's more!"" instead of just releasing the game as-is should tell you alot about the team making this.

They could've thrown out a playable but bare game as the ""launch"" version of this, but they've spent the last four years refining it and adding systems from the old DK, as well as improving them. | 哪位大佬能说一下中文版怎么设置吗，进了游戏之后语言那一栏不让选，默认英文，别的选不了。 | I've got 60 hours in the game, which isn't an awful lot, though they're entirely fun-filled hours.

Enjoying the original Door Kickers game thoroughly, this game did not disappoint at all, and in fact brought in some really great features, such as the ability to 'pie'. 

I'm not great at reviews, but what I can say is that as somebody with no IRL military, police, or tactical background, this game was still a fantastic experience, and after watching a mixture of videos relating to game-specific and some IRL combat tactics, it translated almost perfectly to the game, and I noticed an immediate performance increase / success rate in missions. 

There are many missions that I've not even touched, as I've found myself frustrated after multiple (drastically failed) attempts to complete them. But unlike in most games where it'd feel unfair and unbalanced, the only impression I got was that I'm just not skilled enough to tackle them, and they're essentially saved for a day where I can approach with, hopefully, improved battle tactics/perspective. 

I would definitely recommend this game. Whether you want to test your foresight and tactical knowledge to draw out an entire mission plan and let it play out in it's entirety before your eyes in one fell swoop, or if you, like me, would prefer to step your way through each mission in detail, pausing, planning, advancing, pausing, planning, advancing, then this game has everything you want and likely more.

76561198032898393,1254870,High Strategy: Urukon,0.9,"Indie, Strategy",0,"A compelling distillation of a 4x game. Lore of the world is pretty nice too. A very fun, fast 4x game once you get the hang of it. Very fun | A quick and fun indie strategy game.
The core gameplay loop involves converting different resources into each other, in a very simple and streamlined manner with no fancy graphics or micromanaging, which was exactly what I was looking for at the time I discovered this game. Basically you have a limited amount of actions that convert your resources via known rules into others, and can take one of them per turn.
The different playable factions have different goals, that need to be fulfilled in a set amount of turns, so your goal is to be efficient in the actions you take and find a sensible way to fulfill that goal. A single run is fairly short and can be done in 30 minutes to a bit above an hour.
Some faction goals are harder than others, or require thinking about how you approach them, but I had fun completing all of them.
The presentation is very indie, so dont expect too much in the way of graphics or rewarding messages. I liked the worldbuilding, which was kept a bit vague in some points, but had just enough to get my own imagination going about the places described, even though I mostly don't care that much about these things in my indie strategy games.

76561198032898393,1264280,Slipways,36.88333333333333,Strategy,8,"Sehr befriedigendes brettspielartiges Strategieerlebnis. Mir gefällt besonders, dass es ein Aufbauspiel ohne militärische Komponente ist. Jede Art Planet hat ""Rezepte"", wie man ihn nutzen kann, wenn man ihn kolonisiert. Es geht darum, ein florierendes Netzwerk zwischen den Planeten aufzubauen. 

Dabei gibt's eine Vielzahl von Problemen zu managen: Am Anfang fragt man sich, lieber schnell etwas zum Laufen bringen, um frühes Geld zu verdienen oder lieber erst die ganze Umgebung entdecken, um die Konstellationen zu optimieren? Im mittleren Spiel sollte man neben den klassischen Strategie-Dilemmas (zuerst Wirtschaft ausbauen oder Forschung?) immer auch die bestehende Infrastruktur im Blick haben - oft entstehen im Spielverlauf noch Möglichkeiten zur Verbesserung. Und gegen Spielende willst Du immer mehr expandieren, aber ab einer gewissen Anzahl Planeten wird alles exorbitant teuer. 

Hohe Varianz durch die Auswahl der Völker beim Spielstart. Die Völker haben eine klare Identität (auf welche Spielmechaniken und Spielstile sie sich beziehen), aber in jeder Partie bieten sie eine andere Auswahl an Technologien aus ihrem Pool an. Dadurch spielen sich die Partien vom Anfang bis Schluss sehr unterschiedlich.
Im Standardmodus gibt es zusätzlich noch ""Modifikatoren"", die die Eigenschaften der Karte verändern, auf der man spielt. Die sollte man für die ersten Runden erstmal ausschalten, weil das Grundspiel schon abwechslungsreich genug ist. Wenn man das Spiel besser kennt, sind sie sicher eine willkommene Abwechslung.
Es gibt auch eine Kampagne mit etwas mehr Story, aber ich finde den Standardmodus eigentlich genau richtig! | It's fun. I like it. It's the sort of space-based resource management game that appeals to my brain. Getting things to work is very satisfying! Not having that ONE RESOURCE you need within range is VERY FRUSTRATING! It's a good game to start up when you want to play SOMETHING and aren't sure what. Standard runs are pretty quick. There's still plenty of the game that I haven't interacted with, yet, at 10 hours in. If it looks like the sort of thing you would also like, I highly recommend it. | The game seems simple at first but optimizing for maximum efficiency is very tricky and satisfying to learn. Discovering all the interactions between mechanics has been very addicting and fun. Instantly one of my favorite games of all time. | Un bon jeu d'optimisation en environnement incertain. C'est paradoxalement un bon jeu de détente où le fait de se casser la tête n'a pas d'autre implication que d'avancer plus loin dans le temps et d'avoir un meilleur score. 
But du jeu: coloniser des planètes pour obtenir des ressources, qui elles-même demandent des ressources. Il faudra donc explorer votre espace, coloniser des planètes, puis les relier entre elles (sans croisement, d'où la difficulté). Un fois établie, de nouvelles ressources sont demandées, etc.
Le retour dans le temps permet aussi de faire des tests si on est pas sûr à 100% de notre coup, ou si on fait une erreur (attention cependant, il n'est valable que si les inconnues le reste, donc pas d'exploration). Les parties sont assez courtes (entre 1 et 2 heures selon votre réflexion), et la rejouabilité assez énorme (entre les bonus de races, les technologies, les types de systèmes et les anomalies si on les actives, on a de quoi faire).

En bref, un bon jeu de réflexion (d'optimisation) qui vous fera perdre la notion du temps. | Slipways is refreshingly different by being simple and compact. It's core loop is satisfying and the hard turn cap is very well balanced, keeping the game from dragging on well past your failure or success. It's the little box that makes my colony level 2."
76561198032898393,1270580,Mind Over Magic,8.25,Simulation,0,"a cool twist on a rimworld/oxygen not included formula.

low skill floor, high skill ceiling. keyword system keeps things fresh and interesting without the need to forever explore and expand. pawn stat randomisation and relics give something to chase for. events and difficulty are highly customizable, providing a range of challenge options.

a very easy recommend. | This is a really solid game and it really fills the light management niche quite nicely. 

It's fun to play around in if you like designing and the requirements for all the different types of rooms and spaces in the school vary enough to keep things interesting. It manages to offer a little challenge for those who like adapting on the fly while still being engaging enough for those that like to tear everything down and rebuild in a more organized, modular fashion.

As opposed to Oxygen Not Included, the game doesn't require you to delve into the management of pipes and material transport systems (which was my least favorite part of ONI). There's basic farming and production limits and storage but that's about the extent of it. You can quickly craft little zombie bots to do a lot of your hauling for you which frees up your teachers and students to teach and learn and dance in a circle around an enchantophone.

Staff and student scheduling is simple, though the grouping system is still a bit wonky. I also get the feeling that the devs intend that the 'best' way to play is to churn through your students and staff. Graduating and Retiring your staff is incentivised through the reward of relics which are used to upgrade subsequent students/staff, so if you are one of those players that gets attached to your characters you're going to be making the game more difficult for yourself.

Overall I think this is an easy recommend. The developers have done a great job on the skeleton of the game, so depending on your options chosen it can play as a challenging, resource-scarce, base survival game, a light magic-themed school/base designer game, or anywhere in between. | Mind Over Magic is just great. I play it pretty much since it hit Early Access. One of the best Colony Sims there is. I can wholeheartedly recommend it. | Build your own school for young mages! This is a 2D simulation with many twists over other simulations.

It has exploration, lots of building (with arbitrary rooms and sizes), mage sims who work on the schedules you enter, smart groups for scheduling or tasks where you can create criteria and even new students will be automatically selected, RPG stats and skills, and turn-based old-school tactical magic combat. Although it's 2D, it has much of the creativity of a 3D building game. It will feel familiar to anyone who plays the genre of sims, but has some very unique gameplay elements.

You start at the site of an ancient school of magic destroyed by a curse, and your three starting professors (with the help of the founder's ghost) must recruit and train young mages to eventually become professors, to help lift the curse. The more students you train and graduate, the bigger your school can be, and the more potent the school becomes.

There are tons of secrets to find, unusual plants and materials to harvest, powerful relics to find and create, wands to upgrade, and deadly traps and events to handle.

I found this game quite entertaining, and am a fan of other Klei games such as Oxygen Not Included. This is not as complex as ONI, but has much of the charm and excitement of discovery through exploration. Unlike most RPGs like this, you are expected to graduate students and let them depart forever. Losing a mage may take a little time to replace, but everyone is replaceable. | 好玩，知道玩家想要什么，魔法师的所有关键特性以及遗物的特性都可以通过支付一定的代价进行修改，免去了玩家刷刷刷的时间，不像别的游戏你得机械性的刷刷刷。

 | Cool game. V much feels like a hybrid of an RTS and tabletop wargame in a super cool way. Things I'd like to see as this continues through early access:

Greater differentiation between factions.  Having your starting faction in arena limit your draft selections at town would go a long way towards this. And imo the subtle statline diffs between equivalent units could be more significant/there could be more factional mechanics.

Level ups that give more than just bonus health. Specific stats, second actives, passives, etc would all be cool. Obv it would be a ton of work but I was expecting something more inline with narrative play wargame unit level ups.

Better clarity about the food cost for your units. Overall the food system feels like a very awkward softcap on army size, and the balance of ""do I have enough food to buy more dudes"" is not super engaging, especially since it's pretty consistent, just semi-hidden info. If there were more options to make interesting tradeoffs between food, time, gold, manpower, combat difficulty, shop access, and other resources (bonus xp? events?) as well as a bit more clarity on those costs, and potentially a bit more of a ""push your luck"" aspect to some of that, this portion of the game would be a lot more engaging imo.

Greater starting position/objective/layout variety. There's some v fun and interesting tactical fights to be had in this game as is, but once your army gets to a certain size it becomes very difficult for your army to do anything other than just rank and file to route fights. Some of these seem super easy to implement too (wider variety of starting positions for allies and enemies would do wonders imo).

Also I'm unclear if manpower is supposed to equivalent to an approximate army power rating (it feels like kind of? Except that weaker units tend to have more manpower than stronger units?) but if so, it'd be nice to have an approximate manpower estimate for enemy battles instead of swords which mean.....honestly Idk what the swords mean really, they're super vague.

All of these comments are about the new arena mode update, which is all I've played.

Also the runs are a bit long imo, Spending more than an hour on a daily run is kind of intense.

Overall I really like it and I think this game is super worth checking out, especially if you have any love for tabletop wargames. In particular I really love the charge and order systems. | Very fun, dev has been consistently adding stuff to already great core gameplay loop. Get it now, wait and get it, doesn't matter but if you like strategy games you should probably have this one in your library | This game has the same vibrant enviroment of Battle Brothers but has a more macro approach to battles. And I really like it.
The art and the irony are really a touch from a dev that love his game.
Some reviews say that the game is bugged, i didnt' find any bugs.
Some reviews say that the game is difficult, and for sure it's not easy (but that's a player problem lol).

I'm sad that i could only do one campaign because it was very fun. I hope the dev will add more campaigns sooner. | 大大滴好游戏，就是没有chinese。

Please fix it! | I do not gravitate to automation and factory games due to generally the levels of complexity, the moving parts and the sheer amount of things you have to do in them to get a working, self sufficient, well optimised factory. While I thought Shapez would be the same kind of thing, I was delightfully surprised that after playing a handful of hours - Shapez gives you the bare bones of ""Hey, here's a hub - put shapes in it"". It isn't pretty, there is light and dark mode! 

What I really like about Shapez was the fact that although it clearly states ""This is not an idle game"", I can play it as slow or as fast as I want. Nothing is going to implode if I don't get 5,000 squares in the hub within a 10 minute window with the slowest belt making me start ALL OVER AGAIN. The only thing that happens is that it just takes more time. There's no pressure to need to get good at the game really, really quick or suffer. You as a player can do really whatever you want. Make the most complex, well optimised, efficient factory and find joy in that. Or be like me - take one thing at a time (generally) until you get the hang of it and then just run with it. 

This was a great introductory game to start me off in a genre of game that I generally steered clear of.

这不算充足的随机性除了能让你升血压并不能让你的体验得到提升，毕竟这个游戏所有的肉鸽收益基本都是有滞后性的，鲜少有立即生效却对你收益巨大的情况出现，游戏本身也是比起解决问题更倾向于让问题防患于未然，可以说基本都处于一种今日受苦而明日享福的循环，而人往往并不待见延迟满足，这也是城市建造类游戏的通病，随机性则让这一点被增幅了许多，毕竟脸黑一下的话你的精心布局很可能要到游戏尾声才得以找到key牌启动。

在真正上手游戏的中后期，本作特色的“肉鸽”“建设”属性可以说是基本等于没有（甚至肉鸽方面可能是负作用？），冲着这两点来的颇有几分受骗的味道。高强度下的资源匮乏和时间赛跑让游戏的建设属性约等于无，时间全花在拼尽全力管理有效利用资源上，而肉鸽属性正反馈不足，且低难度通解太多、高难度拿不到最优解血压又太高，负反馈很强导致肉鸽的设计很抽象。

总的来说是值得一个好评的，入手推荐史低，另DLC风评远不如本体，慎入。 | Against the Storm focuses on the best part of a city builder which is the first hours when you are in the building phase.  Against the Storm plays out differently every time because the buildings you start with are always different.   It is a well optimized game, with constant choices of risk vs reward, and enjoyable when you figure out work-arounds for meeting necessary resources, through supply chain management.

What I appreciate about Against the Storm is that there is never is a point where it gets too complicated with too much too deal with at one time.  The equivalent of the ""Boss battle"" is challenging and rewarding.  Graphic and sound design are excellent.

I've played over 650 hours and still not sick of it, so there must be something to this video game.  

Support these devs.  Eremite Games is a Polish developer consisting of six, and they really have created a real gem of a game, and they have been actively improving and polishing the game for more than a year after the day 1 release. | Let me preface this by saying that the game is very well made and I understand why so many people love it. I am not refunding it for any notable flaws.

For me specifically, when I play this type of game I want to dig in and work on one continuous settlement and make it grow over time, eventually getting to a point where I have this massive city that basically runs itself, giving me a primal sense of satisfaction that doesn't need to be felt again for roughly two years. But this game is a rogue-lite with some aspects of a mobile game, where you constantly restart a 'run', so to speak, unlocking stuff to make things more interesting for the next one. And though well-crafted, it's just not the kind of thing I'm looking for in a city-builder. | I genuinely started off liking Against the Storm, but the further you get into the difficulties the more tedious it gets, with additional negative modifiers and additional hoops to jump through to complete the session. Each seal completion really incentivizes you to play the next difficulty to get enough shards to complete the next seal to follow the metaplot, and lower difficulties may not get you the number of seals you need in time - additionally, the further out you go, the higher the minimum difficulty of the embarkment is, pushing the player to embark on those higher difficulty options. Why progress the seals other than metaplot? So you get more resources for the Citadel metaprogression. Which does things like add resources to your starting caravan so you can actually build some production buildings at the start, or adding a production building that let you make many key items - poorly, at high cost, but beneficial for the build chains so you are not fully reliant on RNG to get a building to complete the chain, or even adding bonuses to each race in your settlement like showing you where the first set of fields is where you can build a farm the first time you recruit a Human, so you don't have to spend half the session opening the wrong glades and never getting the constant food production that would provide. 

Except like many modern roguelite hybrids, this metaprogression is poorly balanced, and time consuming, which makes it feel like busywork rather than enjoyable on its own. It makes the higher difficulties less tedious to tackle (especially with some of the more helpful bonuses), but it just feels like an absolute chore to get through. Speaking of chores, they just add more chores without opening meaningful doors and mechanics past Veteran in terms of the difficulty options. The first three difficulties add mechanics each jump - after Veteran comes Viceroy, which is the same thing as Veteran with new forbidden and dangerous glade events to threaten your settlement and that the forest is more hostile by a multiplier of x3 instead of x2, but they don't do anything ""new"" really, they are just more of what you have seen before on earlier difficulties, and they just cost a ton of resources that you may not have been able to produce unless you have enough bonuses from the metaprogression tree and otherwise they apply so many negative benefits your game may actually end, such as the Stormbird which as far as I can tell by searching across the internet, people have been complaining is poorly balanced even with a good settlement for years. I don't just mean negatively either - the Stormbird applies an infinite storm effect, locking you to a year until you finish it (which you could delay), which is abusable in its own right if you were lucky enough to find it early. The Stormbird is just absurdly out of band in both directions and I cannot understand the intent of including it compared to every other event. I suppose that its very existence changes the logic pattern of whether you should open forbidden glades at all, but the higher difficulties disincentivize the opening of small glades due to hostility modifiers, so that just leaves dangerous glades if you do not want to starve but want to ensure a manageable event. What a forcible winnowing of the meta - it creates a very rote playstyle even though the apparent point of RNG building choice to create more unstable, dynamic push-and-pull gameplay. 

By the way, the tree also has a level attached - as you go through various sessions you get XP, when you level up you unlock new buildings and cornerstones (buffs) to show up in the game. THIS metaprogression mechanic is where the actual doors are opened for new build orders. Except its just as slow as the tree since its a blocker on the tree - without those later buildings and cornerstones, the game is not necessarily giving you the tools to win on higher difficulties. The amount of XP seems really low as well no matter the difficulty and even with completing various achievement challenges, which just exacerbates the issue.

I assume the decision not to bind those buildings and cornerstones to the higher difficulties and instead to a metaprogression level was so that you can use them on the lower difficulties and practice various build chains, but without overwhelming people when they start to play, and because of the complexity of creating a system that could both leave them default on the higher difficulties and then unlock them for use on the lower one once you cleared the higher one. Though perhaps they could have used their training missions for this. In all honesty the buildings beyond the first few levels matter less than the cornerstones, but they both add to how obnoxious the metaprogression system is - even if it is justified ludonarratively. 

In positives, I genuinely like the give and take between blight and production starting with the Veteran difficulty. I enjoy the season model and how each session naturally pushes you to modify your build chain on the fly or attempt to produce enough of your current resources to trade for the things you need to complete the Orders. I enjoy the fact that a session can take no more than one hour or maybe two at the higher speeds and therefore allows a bite-sized city building experience. I genuinely did get 30 hours out of it so I would say I got my money's worth, and I may play some more now and again, but anything that sufficiently annoys me more than it captivates me gets a negative review especially when the causes will not be immediately apparent to the player. | 与其说是城市营造或者基地建设，更像是有限资源管理游戏，不符合我的兴趣"

This alone gives plenty of replayability.

Additionally, there's some fairly large mods made by the community, although I've yet to delve into any of that as I'm more than satisfied by the vanilla experience for a first playthrough. | esta bueno el juego, entretenido, pero la traducción del juego al español tiene algunos errores pequeños, y cuando uno distribuye uno mismo sus juegos, al menos yo, no siento como si hicera mas ganancia que cuando lo distribuye un editor, pero el resto bastante bien, divertido, yy no se que mas decir."

9/10 | The game has amazing medieval vibe, really reminds me of Kingdom Come Deliverance, especially its city-building DLC. I am not a big fan of RTS because they feel very stressful to me - not the case for this game, you can build your city and chill until you are ready for a fight. What made me really fall in love with the game is the attention to details - nothing is made out of thin air. For example, if you want to make some ale you need to plow a field, plant barley, wait for it to grow, harvest, transport it to a malt house, craft malt, transport malt to a brewery, craft some ale and finally distribute through a tavern and you can track EVERY process! Your citizens will actually plow a field, build a tavern and malt house brick by brick, transport barley, malt and ale, and finally visit a tavern for a drink.

Love the game! Looking forward to some combat enhancements as well as some civ-style progression in the form of policies, unit experience upgrades, or maybe even some tech tree | Manor Lords! Non è un titolo poi così semplice da inquadrare dal momento che racchiude diversi aspetti tutti meritevoli di un'attenta analisi: è uno strategico, un gestionale e un ""city builder"". Beh, solo? Direi di no! Vediamo perché: tralasciando tutti gli aspetti riguardanti le meccaniche costruttive, commerciali e produttive sarebbe riduttivo classificare Manor Lords alla stregua di un consueto ""city builder"" difatti, la parte più importante del gioco, non sono gli edifici con le loro funzioni (comunque ben riprodotte) bensì i suoi abitanti i quali, come le reali controparti di un qualsiasi villaggio medievale europeo, operano e interagiscono con una precisione, logicità e realismo pressoché totali. I personaggi sono molto ben realizzati e i loro costumi sembrano quelli tipici di un mondo feudale ormai lontano, gli strumenti che usano sono davvero quelli realmente esistiti (pur con i comprensibili adattamenti ai fini videoludici) e l'atmosfera che si vive è esattamente quella che si sarebbe potuta trovare in un reale insediamento del XIII° sec. A tal proposito consiglierei di farsi una bella passeggiata, di tanto in tanto, in mezzo alle case, ai vari edifici, per le strade e per i sentieri del nostro villaggio… magari anche una scampagnata ""fuori porta"", giusto per assaporare quell'alone di ""selvaticità"" e di mistero che si prova nella foresta, magari appena prima di giungere nella nostra piccola città… un qualcosa di ""sapore"" molto medievale!
Passiamo ora all'aspetto gestionale vero e proprio e qui abbiamo parecchio materiale di cui discutere: le botteghe sono ben realizzate e quelle prive di muri perimetrali rivelano la loro essenza ed essenzialità in base all'attività che vi si svolge (non sarebbe male poter visitare anche dall'interno quelle racchiuse da muri, un po' come avviene nei titoli della serie ""The Guild""). La produzione avviene in ragione alla quantità di materie prime presenti nei magazzini (fermo restando che ogni bottega ha il suo deposito interno) ed è quindi evidente che la raccolta dei materiali di base è fondamentale: non si possono tagliare assi di legna o produrre legname da ardere se prima non avremo collocato una o più segherie per abbattere gli alberi, alberi che possono essere reimpiantati dai Guardaboschi garantendo, in tal modo, la continuità della produttività forestale (anche se non nell'immediato, ovvero il tempo necessario ad una pianta perché ricresca). Tutte le altre attività seguono lo stesso schema, schema che può sembrare banale o scontato ma che, ad un'occhiata più approfondita, non lo è affatto! Già, poiché dovremo fare i conti con le stagioni, gli incendi, il clima non sempre prevedibile e i banditi! Questi ultimi possono essere piuttosto fastidiosi, forse persino più di un ipotetico ""lord"" concorrente voglioso di occupare tutta la mappa!
 A proposito di mappe, ne sono state aggiunte due: la High Peaks e la Winding River. La parte riguardante la viabilità è ancora la stessa e l'unica aggiunta all'opzione ""strada/via/sentiero"" è la possibilità di costruire i ponti, il che non è cosa da poco! Perché? Semplice: i ponti non sono utili solamente per attraversare un fiume, servono anche a difendere il nostro territorio da un attacco nemico… già, ma come? Proviamo a pensare ad una invasione condotta da parte di un'armata più numerosa della nostra e in cui quell'unico ponte è la sola via d'accesso che il nemico ha per arrivare a casa nostra: bene, con un pugno di uomini ben armati e con il supporto di una buona squadra di arcieri o balestrieri sarà possibile arrestare quell'armata, armata che si troverà costretta a combattere usando solo pochi uomini alla volta dato che l'unico passaggio è rappresentato da quel singolo e ristretto ponticello (verrebbe da pensare alla famosa Battaglia di Stamford Bridge, in cui un unico Berserker arrestò l'intera spedizione di Re Harold il Sassone).
Apriamo, dunque, il capitolo ""Battaglie"" ma, a tal proposito, è necessario introdurre un aspetto fondamentale: la produzione delle armi ed i relativi equipaggiamenti! Questi vanno evidentemente o prodotti (scelta consigliabile, se possibile) o acquistati nel Mercato (sconsigliabile dati i prezzi molto alti ma talvolta inevitabile). Le uniche strutture adibite alla loro produzione sono le Abitazioni… mi meraviglio che nel gioco non siano presenti delle botteghe specificatamente adibite a tal scopo…
Le Battaglie sono piuttosto schematiche e semplificate (beh, non è un Total War) ma comunque interessanti e ben riprodotte: i vari tipi di unità si possono utilizzare in base alla loro tipologia ed è possibile mettere in campo un armata costituita da un insieme bene assortito in cui siano presenti un po' tutti gli schieramenti disponibili, utili a tutti i tipi di scontri. Se non abbiamo abbastanza materiale per costruire armi e comporre un esercito è possibile assoldare delle Compagnie di Mercenari, a patto di disporre di un Castello e di aver ottenuto la fiducia del nostro Re.
Diplomazia: c'è anche quella! I trattati diplomatici sono rappresentati, come per le battaglie, nella loro essenzialità e si limitano ad una ""lettera"" in cui è possibile lusingare, sbeffeggiare se non addirittura dichiarare guerra ad un nostro vicino, briganti compresi. Vi sono però alcuni vantaggi utili sia a garantirci una pace più o meno duratura che ad un aumento di influenza nei confronti del nostro Re.
Strutture presenti: buone sia nel numero che nella loro qualità (aspetto sicuramente migliorabile seppur già sufficiente così).
Le strutture pubbliche (Chiesa, Castello, Cimitero e Birreria) aumenteranno l'Ordine Cittadino mentre quelle di carattere economico/produttivo andranno ad implementare il nostro tesoro e le nostre attività in genere. Queste ultime, in particolare, sono vincolate ad un ""Albero Tecnologico/Politico"" che sarà imprescindibile per lo sviluppo del nostro villaggio: più si cresce e maggiori saranno le opzioni selezionabili e più ne verranno sbloccate e più cresceremo, discorso molto diretto ma non semplice da realizzare dato che dovremo anche qui fare i conti con il clima, il numero di abitanti e le risorse disponibili.
Aspetti da implementare/aggiungere: la possibilità di intraprendere commerci per via d'acqua, magari anche marittimi (se e quando, ovviamente) con l'aggiunta una banchina d'approdo per tali commerci, la possibilità di interagire direttamente con i vari abitanti, la possibilità di eleggere una sorta di Consiglio Cittadino (magari diventeremo una ""Signoria"" o ""Repubblica"" in modo da garantirci l'Autonomia e l'Indipendenza), espandere le strutture difensive a partire dal nostro Castello e ultimo, ma non per ultimo, implementare il già citato ""Albero Tecnologico"" e le opzioni diplomatiche.
Giudizio finale! Direi ottimo, davvero un capolavoro se consideriamo che Manor Lords è stato portato avanti da un singolo sviluppatore nel corso di diversi anni e poco importa se i vari miglioramenti e le patch arrivano un po' col contagocce: stiamo parlando di un gioco molto ben costruito e particolarmente realistico (che, personalmente, è quello che chiedo da un titolo simile)!
Lo consiglierei? Ma assolutamente sì, almeno per gli amanti del genere… e il prezzo è più che onesto, aspetto non secondario anche se prosaico! Provatelo e potrete giudicare in prima persona! | So far this game has been a lot of fun. Really love the mechanics and can't wait to see this game when it's ready for full release. 

I picked up the game on sale for 27$ but honestly wouldn't mind paying 40$ for it. The dev is mostly solo and creating a fun new game. Glad to pay 40$ to this dev rather than 40$ to EA or Activision.

[hr][/hr]
There is something wrong with the ""Discover the world"" game mode that seems to be present ever since the December 14th or 20th 2024 update: In this game mode you must unlock a new country every 7 minutes or you fail. Before one of these last 2 patches to the game the game mode was a lot easier to start and now something feels fundamentally broken, in its current state you seem to 6/10 percent of the time get scenarios where you will lose before unlocking the second country or within the first couple few and this is extremely upsetting because this never use to be a problem prior to one of these updates. It was always a challenge, but a fair and enjoyable one. However, now, it feels nearly impossible to even get started.

Also as I've been playing recently, harsh penalties now seem to more frequently trigger way too early in the game, the events such as needing to sell flight tickets at half cost, or the airplane company going on strike causing parts and planes to be x2 the cost. In fact I played 2 games before written this review where half cost flight tickets came up before being able to purchase the first country :/
These used to appear later when you had more infrastructure to handle them. But now, they hit you in the first few minutes, leaving you with no way to recover.

I bought it anticipating a game akin to Mini Metro or Mini Moterway as I really enjoy those 2 games, and both have nice polish and balance, but this just doesn't have the same level as polish. While I was willing to ignore, or for better terms sort of overlook that before as more of a rough edge, now its just too hard because its not just some strange gameplay issues, its frequently being unable to actually achieve what the game expects, and that's just not fun. 

I hope the developers take a closer look at these updates and restore the balance that made ""Discover the World"" an enjoyable and rewarding experience, If that happens, I could see myself giving this game a more positive review, although the game still does lack the polish of the other titles I mentioned above, and its gameplay loop becomes stale far too quickly, Scenarios mode is there as well but definitely is not as good at making the game less stale as additional maps, though I understand how that wouldn't be as easy to do in this game vs the game I mentioned. | This game is bad. My game was over just because it couldn't redirect the camera over a full city filled with people. I could have saved the game, but I was pretty confident about its proper functioning. I was so wrong.

4/10 | I love this game and all the scenarios it gives. I wish it didn't lag when you get fairly into Discover World mode | This game is bad. There’s only one game mechanic, and while it might be interesting at first, it gets boring very quickly. The game lacks variety, making it feel repetitive pretty quick.
The game balance is awful—after progressing through a few countries, you simply don’t have enough resources to manage the routes effectively. Even if you go as far as abusing save files to predict upcoming random events, it’s still impossible to maintain a stable economy. That’s a major shitbag for a game that relies on resource management.

It was fun to explore the one mechanic it offers, but for $10, it’s just not worth it. With such little content and variety, this feels more like a $5 game at best. Unless the developers add more depth and balance fixes, I can’t recommend it. | 游戏设计存在一些明显缺陷，比如美洲和亚洲之间的航线不跨太平洋而是跨过整个欧亚大陆，距离显著比现实中要长；另外很多剧情设计得并不合理，产生的地点或者事件非常随机，也没有预期导致经常打乱整体布局；而且一条航线购买的飞机不能调度，只能固定在原来的航线上……总之，还需要好好打磨，游戏体验还有很大提升空间，开发者应当搞清楚一个前提：故意设置不合理的条件和突发事件来提升难度会严重影响游戏体验。"

Você entra animado e sai frustrado, questionando suas escolhas de vida.

A jogabilidade é um caos. Você tenta passar, e a bola vai parar no adversário. O goleiro? Uma hora faz milagres, na outra deixa um chute fraco entrar. Seu zagueiro parece bêbado quando você mais precisa dele, e o famoso momentum garante que, se você estiver vencendo, seus jogadores vão virar cones enquanto o adversário se transforma no prime Barcelona.

No Ultimate Team, a experiência beira o sadismo. Você monta seu time suado e enfrenta um adversário com um Mbappé comprado com dinheiro do aluguel. Os servidores fazem questão de adicionar delay nos momentos mais críticos, garantindo que você aperte para chutar, mas veja o goleiro pegar antes mesmo da animação começar.

A arbitragem? Um desastre. Carrinhos assassinos passam batidos, mas encostar no adversário é pênalti.

E o pior de tudo? Esse ainda é o melhor FIFA que já teve.

76561198032898393,1578650,Citizen Sleeper,0.0,"Adventure, Indie, RPG",0,"A very addictive RPG visual novel set in a sci-fi/cyberpunk future.

You play as a sleeper, an emulated consciousness uploaded into a synthetic robotic body. A victim of corporate propaganda, you signed a contract of servitude, selling your real body away for the promise of a life off-world. But after losing faith in this promised future, you escaped with others from your indentured servitude. Being the only one to make it out alive, caught between a stolen past and an uncertain future, you find yourself on a decaying space station where you must evade the hunters after you and survive, all while trying to buy or synthesize the stabilizer you need to postpone your planned obsolescence.

I found the writing excellent and became completely engrossed by the different life stories of the station's inhabitants. It was easy to get attached to the various characters living on the station.
I also really liked the game's characters design, which reminded me of Katsuhiro Otomo's art style.
And the electronic music was a perfect fit for conveying the atmosphere of isolation and desperation on the station in the game's dystopian world.

Gameplaywise, I didnt find the game particularly difficult. After getting the hang of the mechanics, completing tasks and progressing through the game was fairly easy. Failure was ok as the game was quite forgiving. In my single playthrough, I only missed three achievements. The game has many endings, but you can continue playing by pressing [continue] after the end credits. To experience more endings, always choose the option to leave the station first, when given a choice.
It also didnt seem like the type of sleeper you started with really mattered. I finished the game with 4 out of my 5 sleeper skills fully upgraded.

The game's main strength lies in its fantastic writing and storytelling. So, if you enjoy great sci-fi/cyberpunk stories, you should definitely play this. | Impossible vibes. It's like if the comforting isolation of falling asleep to a white noise generator was a RPG. Incredible game and a very cool interpretation of a distant sci-fi/ cyberpunk future. | This game has some of the most beautiful stories and characters I've seen in a video game, or even some novels I've read. Over the years, you just don't find things like this. I'm a war hardened, grown man, and some of the story threads in this cut me deep. Thank you for this experience. | Citizen Sleeper is an OK game. In this glorified VN you play as a rogue ""Sleeper"" (hey, that's half the name of the game!) a robot with the brain of someone in cryostasis trying to escape the clutches of the evil corporation that employed you. Citizen Sleeper utilizes its cyberpunk influence to make a very compelling college brochure / kinetic novel, but not necessarily an interesting game.
To not be entirely dour on the game I'll conceit, I played the game, I got 3 of the 6 endings, and I only fell asleep twice. The core slash only gameplay mechanic of knowing what your dice rolls will be before you have a skill check is pretty nifty, and lets you choose to prioritize succeeding at the things you want to succeed at and fail at things you don't really care about. The game actually has an interesting cyberpunk setting and world its built, as opposed to the usual ""future city but neon and bad"" sloppa you usually get. The game can be finished in one or 2 short sittings. The look of the game is fairly iconic and inspired, and while you might not like the vaguely zog adjacent character designs, it is its own style and you're not going to see other games of the similar setting even remotely attempt this ambition, especially with its small 3 man team, even larger in breadth of scope and intention of design, so you have to admire the sheer passion and care involved.
And we've come to the part where I become a big fat meanie, so if you read that and are like ""wow, hey wait, [i]I[/i] like words and pictures! I'm going to buy this now!"" please, be my guest, its not bad.




[i]However[/i],,,
Citizen sleeper is not a game!!!! It's a VN with extra clicking!!!! The writing is one note, every character speaks in the same voice and I can't tell you anything a character said beyond aphorisms, cliches, occasional vague left footed marxist toe steps, and brief fellations towards the unnamed player character. A former soldier tells you his adopted daughter ""saved him, actually"", another tells you that you just don't get it do you, and my personal favourite, when you help a bounty hunter kill a man and she pays you, you drop the money on the ground and say ""what life is worth this"". I promise you, that you can google every cliche movie line and I guarantee its somewhere in this game spoken by the widely diverse cast of characters. That dice thing I talked about earlier becomes negligible past the first or second hour as once you've gained a couple levels, you can acquire the ability to reroll at any point during a turn, even when you only have one die left. Naturally, I abused this to get the main ending i wanted out of the game, because why not. In general though, levelling up trivializes the game, your first level, if you so choose can be spent to negate any weaknesses your character class had, you CAN add plus 2 bonuses to your rolls but by the end i was rolling too many 5's and 6's to even think of that as an investment. There's a skill to regain health and stamina for free, but you get so much money for every little thing you do you have to go OUT OF YOUR WAY TO FAIL AT ANYTHING. The game constantly terges and teases impending doom and choices mattering, however, I realized early on you don't actually have any agency in the solipsistic monologues the characters speak to you, so I said the meanest dialogue option I could, every time, and, every time, they would just ignore me and keep monologuing about the world. Speaking of doom, I'll let you know now, if you run out of health? You get put back to half health at the cost of one of your buffs/debuffs, if you run out of time on your bounty hunter missions? You get the same cutscenes as you would if you were a good boy. You are simply watching the story unfold from the eyes of another, the room starts spinning and I begin experiencing extreme depersonalization, is this how it is in the game? or is this every day for me? Do I truly want the life I lead? Do I have the choice to not want it after all? These are the questions I ask myself as I click through dialogues, rush through sidequests for my favourite characters, then distributing my worst rolls in a pyramidial manner to characters I like slightly less and so on so forth.


In the world of Disco Sleeper, there's a heavy dearth over the whole universe that capitalism has made things as awful as they are, and I don't mind me a good rage against the machine, hey, I rage against the machine myself too sometimes,

[i]However[/i], 
I do have a problem when its so piss easy to progress in whatever way you want it makes the evil society look ideal. Like in the world of citizen sleeper, you save every minute so you can walk away whenever you want, and there's no consequences for doing absolutely nothing to help yourself. And even moreso everyone is so nice to eachother there's no danger in the world at all. People in mortal bitter rivalries talk out their problems, people steal and get stolen from with no desire for reprisal. The one character that does anything remotely morally questionable immediately renounces her 'evil' (she was in the right btw) ways and decides to abandon her current life for that similar to one of a nun. So its not just the player that all this is just insanely easy for. This world is awesome to live in, this awful world is better to live in than my actual real awful world. If this is the world that the evil capitalists built for the people of Erlin's Eye, sign me up. Sign me up for 2 even, so I can wreck one.

And despite all this, the game was alright. There IS an interesting world and ideas behind all the genera and eye-rolling, I'd buy it on a sale or something if you're willing to live with the big howevers mentioned above.

If you're looking for a similar idea of what you're getting into I'd liken this game to Va1ha11a cyberpunk bartending, where there's an incredibly shallow gameplay mechanic and an incredibly shallow story and they're both smushed together so you don't really realize why neither portion are as good or fleshed out as they could be. | I enjoyed this one quite a bit. More of a visual novel than a typical game.

Pretty good writing but not mind-blowing. The gameplay mechanics are under-developed, especially towards the end they become a bit of a chore. 

But! The story, characters and situations as a whole make up for the flaws. This a very immersive and emotional experience, it really manages to transport you into its world. So overall it's worthwhile."

The war scenarios are a bit lackluster, but apart from that it has everything you would want.

Only complaint is that they still haven't figured out a decent lobby browser / matchmaking system. | It's a fun game that doesn't quite feel as polished together as the first two games in the series.  The war scenarios have the potential to be interesting but like the rest of the game it feels like the overall design needed more thought.  Visually it is pleasant enough even if the environments to do somehow feel a bit paper thin.  The two new characters you will play as are pretty lame, especially compared to the previous protagonist.

- I'm not a Dune series / movies fan
- Very good tutorial; I also watched someone explain the physical board game to get more of the references
- Match making system is every 30 minutes, they start matches of 3-4 players.
- Matches last about 2.5 hours. I felt a bit drained after my first match, mostly because of the length. On the one side I felt this was way too long, but there were some turns where I wish I had more time to execute my actions, so I guess it's just right really.
- Feels like development on this game is thoughtful and intentional, and the UI is easy to navigate. Makes me think the developers actually made a game they'd play too :) | I’ve been really enjoying Dune: Imperium! As someone who loves the original board game, I was excited to see how they’d translate it to digital, and I think they nailed it.

Gameplay: The mix of worker placement and deck-building is super fun. There are so many ways to approach the game, whether you want to focus on faction alliances, resource gathering, or just go all-in on combat. I’ve played quite a few times, and each game has felt different, which keeps things interesting.

Visuals and Sound: The visuals are gorgeous! The art does a fantastic job of capturing the Dune vibe, and the interface is pretty easy to get the hang of. Plus, the music and sound effects really add to the immersion—sometimes I just sit back and soak it all in. | 电影书籍桌游，沙丘好玩的无需多言 | The board game itself is really fun, and this implementation is as good

I have experienced quite a few UI bugs while playing, such as being unable to dismiss notifications and having to reload into the game because it's blocking options you need, and I frequently experience a lot of lag when dragging tribute tokens. It's nothing game breaking, my friends haven't experienced it, and I love this game otherwise, but it's only fair to mention.

Otherwise, I personally love the art (even the archfiends), the music and the gameplay. The start can feel frustrating when you're stuck on two order slots, but strategising to find how to increase them as quickly as you can while also defending yourself and harassing others is one of the most satisfying parts of the game for me (aside from spamming demands as Andromalius so you can duel praetors). Even something as small as the order in which you take actions can make or break the game, and there's a lot of depth in terms of the options you have available to you when you explore the game.

I also highly recommend giving the chronicles a go, I love the unique dialogue you can receive while playing them. It really adds to the archfiends' characterisation and gives some extra little tidbits of lore. | Great strategy game that can be played asynchronously.
Give yourself and your opponents sleepless nights and learn to scheme! | Interesting take on the 4X format, game slaps in multiplayer with friends, its surprisingly fun where you would expect it to be frustrating. | As others have said, approach this more as a board game than as a Civ game: for most of the game, you're only getting 2-3 actions per turn, and victory (usually) comes down to counting points. Games move quickly and force you to prioritize what you do each turn: move units, collect resources, conduct diplomacy, purchase new units or upgrades, etc. It's a pleasant 2-3 hour tactical diversion. | Amazing game, wonderful to have a few games going which I can play before I go to work!"

さて、開発元のSokpopは、２０１７年から現在まで、かれこれ１００タイトルを超えるゲームをリリースして来ました。知りませんでした。それも翻訳が必要だと思う様なゲームには大体日本語が対応してますし、複雑で不便な日本語を忠実に再現出来ていて、このSokpopという方々は何者なんだと思いまして、ホームページを見に行きましたところ、メンバー最年長のtijmenさんがバク転してました。爽やかで結構。

そのゲームタイトルの中でも一番売れているというこのStacklandsは、見ての通りのカードゲームですが、食料の概念が有りまして、村人が増えれば出来る作業が増えるけれども、食料が足りなくなるので、食料生産の自動化をして、やってるうちに敵が攻めて来て、ハンマーやつるはしを剣と盾に持ち替えて、戦って、死んで、やったー食料が減らないから一人でいいや、何だっけこの宝箱、何だミミックか、よし全滅。というゲームです。

親切にクエストが組まれていて、最後までストレス無く変化に富んだサバイバル生活が楽しめるので、ライト勢にもオススメですし、かあどげえむ・ぼおどげえむが元々好きな方でもハマると思います。ブースターを剥く時のワクワクがここにあります。

Sokpopは他のゲームもワンアイデアが盛り込まれたちょっとイイじゃんっていう物が多い様に見えます。ホームページにPatreon.c0mへのリンクがデカデカと掲載されていましたので、飛んでみましたところ、４０００人以上の会員様がいらっしゃってこれだけで約６０００ドル／月という支援を受けており、その資金を使って更に毎月新しいゲームを開発して会員やSteamユーザーはニコニコ、開発者はバク転しているという好循環を生み出しています。

靴下マークのオランダ人４人組Sokpop。ちょっと好きになりました。実績が全部靴下なのは勘弁して下さい。 | 神殿に聖杯を捧げたらストーリー進むと思うじゃないですか！！！！！！！！！！！！！！ | The game has an interesting style for those who like resource management and city build. Unfortunately my review is negative because I tend to gather many resources, and the game becomes unmanageable when this happens, partially because the board size is smaller than the necessary, partially because new resources are not smartly grouped (they can be initially, but not for the long run). and then you start to focus more on the board management than the actual gameplay. My feeling is that the mechanic right now should be a beta version, and the true game should still be better polished before a true release. I do believe if the dev works in these improvements, the game may be a recommended one, but not right now.

Don't get me wrong, great idea, TI4 is a fantastic game and Stellaris Nexus  (because that's what it was sold as all through EA and it changed less than a month before release) does a decent job of it. Sadly, whatever support it was  going to get was probably gutted when Paradox rug pulled the Stellaris theme from it, changed the name to that of a phone, pushed 1.0 release, and dropped it like a rock.

OW has competent AI that plays the game properly. It's perhaps a 4x game with one of the better AIs I've played against. In a war it tries to flank you for max damage, shoot from hills for maximum range, use forests to minimize ranged damage etc. War in OW is tactical. Flanking, units adjacency, terrain, and preparation (you can't heal in a neutral land, unless you have certain skills) - it all matters. 

4 DIPLOMACY IS COMPLEX AND CRUCIAL
Diplomacy in OW has two levels: internal and international with Opinions mechanic that synergizes with other systems. 
In OW you don't just establish cities of your civilization. With each new city you choose a renown family to run it (3 families each game out of 4 options; each nation has a different set). They have different bonuses, interactions with terrain, demands and limits to what character can govern their city. This way cities are different to each other. The Families opinion matters. Low Family opinion affects the maintenance of their cities. Armies you produce belong to the families and their combat effectiveness synergizes with your internal diplomacy as well (including General's opinion of you if one is added to an army).
On top of that you also have individual characters (courtiers) with friendships, love affairs, rivalry, assassinations, ambitions (power hungry), or significant public popularity (Rising Stars that can overthrow you). You also have civil wars where you may end up destroying your own city. 
Wars in OW can be intense and can significantly compromise what you can do in a turn. It really pays off to prevent war with a political marriage, even with a tribal leader against the public opinion, than risk invasions on multiple fronts. Besides, happiness in attacked cities tanks down and this can trigger further problems (unhappiness raises city's maintenance and a chance of rebellion). War in OW is a big deal: victories can boost your Legitimacy, but defeats break it. You need alliances and proper diplomacy to secure survival. You invest in building trust (Opinion) for more diplomatic options. 

5 The BARBARIANS, TRIBES AND FIXED CITY SPOTS
Besides different nations OW has Barbarians and 6 different tribes. Tribes may occupy vast or smaller map space with their camps. And the tribes in OW can be devastating. Each camp spawns units every few years and if too many they become raiders, even if you're at peace with them. You can get unexpected mini invasions where they pillage, attack cities and wound/kill workers. So your city placement, armies stationing and natural barriers like mountains play a role. 
There are benefits to defeating tribes and to alliances with them. In OW you have fixed city settlement locations. A few guaranteed ones at the start; more you get from warfare or diplomacy. I think the fixed City Spots improve the game significantly. There's no dumb AI settling a city on your border for irrational tensions. And a wide expansion makes you think and plan how you can secure distant, new cities. 
Overall, the tribes in OW add a lot of tension, threat and historical sensitivity that I really like.

6 ECONOMY WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF RESOURCE TYPES
All resources matter and you can run short of something even in the late game. Access to the best units is not just a matter of tech, but also depends on the level of your culture, a chain of buildings and multiple resources to maintain them.

7 DYNAMIC, MORTAL CHARACTERS
Playing as a mortal ruler, that you develop in stats and traits, is more fun than having one fixed option throughout eras.
I love the Archetypes for Characters, with different layers of bonuses when acting as the Leader, Governor or army Commander. For Instance a Builder Leader can assign multiple workers to a project and they have -1 turn to build improvements and more. 
It's also brilliant that courtiers' stats contribute to the resources pool of your empire. Giving them a job provides a yearly experience, thus upgrades. Using courtiers missions gives them even more experience. This way even having spy agents in foreign empires benefit your resources pool. Its a dynamic system where you want to use courtiers, they change and play an important role. 

8 EVENTS THAT BRING FLAVOR AND VARIETY
OW claims to have over 3 thousand events!!! Some go in chains and develop over time. Some involve historic characters and situations. I love that the OW events pop up with jingle sounds! Big, immersive windows with beautiful art! Love all the art of Wonders especially – they represent so well the grand scale of these projects! My favorite events are when a courtier becomes inspired by my empire's wonder (that they aren't just buildings with buffs) and when a battles winning general becomes a Rising Star and creates a political threat. It's empire AND character building together with storytelling.

9 there is DEPTH, NUANCES, AND HISTORIC SENSITIVITY
So many things in OW make it's ""world"" alive and interesting beyond the clickfest of developing tiles or attacking.
When your worker is wounded it builds a turn longer. 
When you're allied with a tribe you control their units. And when ravaged by war a Tribe can ask you for refuge, creating slums in your city. 
Scouts in OW can do many things and remain useful. From providing Legitimacy for discovered landmarks, to harvesting resources and spying. With proper tech, a Scout can establish spy network in foreign city. Then your spies can provide you with vision and destabilization options; for instance you can try to trigger rebellions in several cities at once right before you attack. All these in a Civilization like game!!!

I also like that the Tech options are semi-random.

10 ART STYLE, (fantastic) MUSIC, and ATMOSPHERE
Music in the OW is just AWESOME! Sometimes I just keep playing OW because I enjoy its soundtrack so much. 
It's a good looking game that sticks to one period of history but with depth and atmosphere. This way playtime isn't that long, but isn't short either. Due to the Orders mechanic limitations other players turns go fast, so less waiting time.

LAST BUT NOT LEAST
The game has never crashed for me.
I haven't found OW to be overwhelming to learn. It took me around 10 hours to become familiar with all the basics. OW has an excellent in-game encyclopedia.
The game is very customizable. 
The base game of OW has the full, good experience and not hiding crucial features behind paid DLCs. 
OW is first and foremost a great strategy game (with RPG flavor). It has a healthy complexity, depth, historic references, and fulfilling struggle.

NEGATIVES
In spite of symmetrical design, I've got an impression some nations are much better than others. I'm still figuring out if it's inflexibility of my playstyle or design's imbalance. | I am a university professor, game developer, and 4X TBS game fanatic. I played, developed, collaborated on, play tested, analyzed, wrote about, and searched for 4X TBS games most of my life. 
I played thousands of games and tens of thousands of hours of TBS games. I make this post after 300 hours of playing Old World. My estimated level of knowing and understanding Old World and its features: 60%.
Far from being perfect, but my perception is that Old World is currently the second best game out there. (I may be biased to 4X TBS, although I played many other genres).
Old World has the usual big problems with the UI: cumbersome, confusing, slow, buggy. Its AI seems to be somewhat better than the other 4X TBS AIs. As of today, 4X TBS AIs without exception are very poor based on my personal experience with hundreds of these games. 
But Old World’s design is one of the best I have seen so far in any 4X TBS game. Finally, I see Order Points that limit the number of actions per turn and limit my movements. I advocated for this for 30 years in 4X TBS development. This game has great feature diversity, depth, and attention to details. Many things can be customized, even the music. I am yet to try the multiplayer. The developers genuinely understand and care about their product which combo is rare to find in the 4X TBS genre. This is not just another dumbed down “clone” of an earlier game that dominates the 4X TBS market today. They still push new patches which is great. This game is similar to Civilization 4, but much better. It also has tactical depth, role playing, and probabilistic planning, and a lot more. Kudos to the developers and I wish they will provide many years of support to fix the bugs, improve the UI, further tune the balance, and strengthen the AI to make the game even better than now.
 | This game cheats during combat. Making moves the player can't make. 
The Computer always has 2,000 Shields, which allows it to Force March troops, even after spending all of those points to move troops or attack. 
EVERY army the AI has, has a General in it. 
The AI brings back Generals the next turn.
It's oppressive. 
90% of the Events that happen are bad for you, or negative, or cause negative effects.
It's way too hard to be peaceful and ally with another nation. 
No matter what you do, what tech you have, or how good you are with other AI players, they backstab you.
The Orders system is F'd, because you're restricted every turn, and you can't DO everything you need to do in your turn, like fight a war. If your king/queen has less Orders (moves) than the enemy and you have to fight a war, you're already dead. I hate it. 
I've been trying to deal with this since I got the game, and have disliked it, and the further I get into a game, the worse it becomes. This ONE issue is enough to make me never play it again.

I've been spending up to 12 hours a day in this game for days now, and it's just stupidly overpowered against the player. Just when you start to get things right, the game sh_its on you. I had a few years of absolute peace, and building up my army and building up my cities, only to get absolutely rolled by the AI, who always had better tech, had more troops, and never ran out of Generals. 
The movement across mountains, or using more Shield points than it should have to move troops is what did it for me. 
I know the AI cheats in every game vs. Humans, but this is ridiculous. 
F this game. It's got so many problems that Civ doesn't have. It's like they looked at Civ and went, ""You know, how do we make the game way harder, and more difficult at the same time?... Oh, I know! We'll add families and traits, and negative events THAT NEVER STOP every turn so the player never wins...""
Also, this game will make your computer get really hot, max our your fans on your GPU, and has a conflict with Medal where it makes Medal tell you it's going to record the game every 5 min. 
I had 2 cores heat up to 92c, which NEVER happens. And maxed out all of my P-Cores to min of 80c. (80-92c) That's insane!
I have a 13900K (Yes, I did the BIOS update to keep it from melting.) with a Lian Li 360 AIO running at full speed 100% of the time, and a total of 7 fans. 32GB of DDR5, and a 2080Super. I watch HWMointor because this game makes my computer a Space Heater. I watch voltages, I watch clock speeds on all cores, and I watch temperatures. No other game does this to my machine.
I don't know how people play this and are OK with it. 
I'll probably uninstall.
Don't buy it. It's not what you think it is. 
Just go play Civ and be happy. | I cannot describe just how much this game has come to dominate my life in the last two years. I've racked up over 1200 hours and I'm only jut starting to ease up.

Old World looks, feels and plays like it was made by 4X fans for 4X fans. It remedies so many of the genre's pitfalls, and the replay value is through the roof. The mix of nations, families, events and characters give each and every game a different flavour. The developers have also kept it consistently patched and tweaked. Cannot recommend it enough, this game beats any other in the genre. | Eine Partie Old World zu spielen ist für mich immer etwas besonderes.Jedesmal erlebe ich eine neue Geschichte und es ist einfach spannend.Fazinierend wie die Entwickler dieses auf die Beine gestellt haben.Wie die ganzen Mechaniken im Spiel ineinander greifen und ein so motivierendes immersives Spielerlebnis erzeugen.
Vorausgesetzt man lässt sich darauf ein.Denn es kann auch hart sein eine Partie zu spielen.Es kann frustrierend sein schlechte Zeiten zu überwinden oder mit  mehreren Kriegen konfrontiert zu werden.Sich dort durchzusetzen macht auch einen besonderen Reiz von Old World  aus.Für mich das beste 4x Game auf dem Markt.

This means that it's a pleasure to watch your minions, i.e. staff and students, going about their business and making you smile from time to time.

There are many courses you can put in your Uni and you must build a lot of rooms to make it functional. I like to build the rooms much more than in TPH because I can put more things in them, not a lot of the same posters.

For those of you not familiar with Two Point Hospital, playing this game is in fact building a University with rooms for classes, dormitories, bathrooms, places to eat and socialize, laboratories. and making sure that you are making money and make all your minions happy and serving the students enough knowledge to graduate with high honors. You can train your teachers and do research to upgrade some of your equipment.
The game is structured in missions and you have objectives to finish them from one to three stars. It's long. I've finished half of the missions in 45 hours. Not including the ones from the DLC, but playing mostly on normal speed, because I really love to watch the simulation. It makes me smile or laugh.

Pros:
- great simulation of an university
- clear and attainable objectives in mission
- relaxing and not at all frustrating (TPH has some annoying grindy moments)
- funny all over the place; the radio is hilarious and some animations too
- it's a pleasure to watch your minions doing their business in your great building af knowledge that you've build with money and sweat
- great music; actually Two Point games are almost the only ones that I play with the sound loud enough to listen what they say

Cons:
- not as funny as TPH. | 一款优秀的模拟经营类游戏，虽然是开大学，但本质还是经营数据通关。和同系列的双点医院玩法大致相同，一些亮点得到了保留，广播还是一如既往的无厘头，但有时候还挺有哲理（不是）。前期很上头，但玩到后面摸索出方法后会觉得有点疲倦，但整体还是很值得玩 | Good old Two Point county. I really love two point hospital after trying it on my Younger brother's steam and I originally had this on switch. I didn't find it fun and forgot about it. Then I found it on here and got the game. I lost track of how long I played the game. I love the silliness of the courses, especially the ones in the space academy DLC.

76561198032898393,529340,Victoria 3,10.783333333333333,"Simulation, Strategy",0,"This game can be summarized in one word: Unpolished

I really want to love this game however in its current state it really is unloveable. If you plan to buy this just be aware that you'll ""only"" get a few hundred hours of fun out of this game as opposed to Paradox usual thousand. And this will not change for a long (at the time of writing this, presumably a few years of) time.

Every nation feels and mostly plays the same and its unpolished state applies to both game mechanics AND [nation]flavour.

If you want to know how you'll play 90% of games if you want to do decently well it will look like this: 1. Pick a great power, 2. liberalize, 3. build an economic based on a construction bubble (Iron, steel, tools) and 4. repeat.

Minor nations are even less playable because by the time you fixed your nation the game is already or close to over.

Im gonna list every Problem I have with this game just do demonstrate the unpolished state of the game however be aware this is by far not every problem the game has to offer:

1. The Warfare system is boring, now theres a lot of criticism for the warfare system by the community however this is one of the features that is in my opinion the least in need of fixing. While it is very oversimplified (You basically draw a frontline and then either attack or defend). I think all this game needs are polishing features like frontlines splitting in 2 causing you to have a hole in your line and causing you to be instantly overrun. Military Research actually affecting your units instead of changing your production method (the Ultra Historical mods fix this). And adding a stockpile for equipment so your military factories stay productive in peace time. Plus making your attack orders actually be followed would go a long way.

2. The game runs super slow by the time you reach 1890 [depending on your PC, +/- ~10 years]. This is especially annoying because it means you get cut off from a lot of cool action. It essentially means you'll rarely see your fruits of labor pay off. Want to play Germany and establish colonies? By the time you've unified Germany and have done all the important other things the game is already slowing down. Want to play as a socialist country? By the time you're ready to become socialist your game is so slow that waiting for laws to pass is no longer fun but just annoying. Want to be Japan? By the time you implemented the right laws the game is too slow to start Japans historic rapid industrialization. Want to play as an American trade empire? By the time you unified America you'll at best have time to get the South Americas into your sphere of influence.

3. The economy system sucks. Want to build an economy as any Great power? Heres how, 1. build iron/coal mines and logging camps, make tools, repeat. 2. Unlock Steel, steel needs iron and coal, iron needs tools, make more tools using steel. 3. Unlock Dynamite, make sulfur mine, make fertilizer factory. Dynamite needs fertilizers which you make with sulfur, then you use the dynamite production method to get more resources out of mines.... resources like sulfur. And that's basically it, now go Laisez Fairre so your capitalists invest in some other stuff so you can larp the semblance of a diverse economy.

3b. Trading sucks. Hoi4 has a more interesting trade mechanic/balance then this game. Every game devolves into an Autarky Simulator. Don't have enough of something? What can you do? You have to build it yourself. Basically no shortage except engines and other rare goods can be fixed using trade. Want to larp an imperialist power that dumps massive amounts of cheap goods into a country causing local competitors to go bankrupt forcing the country to economically rely on you? Tough luck, you cant.[This is a game about colonialism and trading by the way]

4. The politics of this game are super boring and lame, if you want to be decently successful you have 2 options: Capitalist Liberalism to focus on a game with a lot of GDP or Communism to see that standard of living go up. There is no incentive to play anything else. Monarchism and other Authoritarian ways to play only compensate you with ""Authority"" which are points you can use to implement decree's that buff you in a selected state in a bunch of different ways however quite frankly, its useless. And while its obvious that playing as a Theocratic Ethnostate will have little benefits, there is absolutely no reason other then larp to pick them.  Theres no specific unique buff, no odd situational event, nothing. They could have went with something like Monarchies uniting the populace causing less Radicals from political movements or Ethnostates/Theocracies giving less radicals from Standard of Living for the Primary culture but more for oppressed cultures but they chose nothing and hence you are always forced to pick the same old boring policies.

5. The game lacks utter immersion. Despite this game being set in unarguably one of the most important and most rapid changing times of humanity you, the player, feel nothing about it. Are you an industrial great power? Are you a small, non industrial tribe? Are you an oppressed puppet/colony? It ""feels"" the same. The game lacks utter immersion, while even hoi4 tries to immerse you in its setting with news events like the olympic games, the Hindenburg, etc. no such thing is going on in vicky, add this with the already distant experience from the Global Strategy approach and you're in for a dissapointment. Very very rarely do you feel like you're in these turbulent times. Events that are supposed to immerse you rarely work to do that. The only events that do make me feel immersed are that of nihilism, positivism and communism. However 2 of these rarely fire. And it is just as bad for nation specific immersion. As Prussia/Germany, you'll never feel like you're uniting people that want to be united, you just start 3 wars, get an event and annex lands. Or as Japan, you do not get experiences that make you feel like your world was basically turned upside down when the Europeans [yes Europeans because America will not even reach you] open up your country. There is a massive missed chance of adding visual novel'esque events [or news events like hoi4 does] that immerse you. Imagine how great it would be, you play as Japan and suddenly you're forced to open up. And while you change your laws you keep getting pop ups about people/interest groups describing their perspective of a changing Japan. You could see how displeased the Samurai's are getting with each event, how they feel about losing their privileges while for the Peasantry you feel their sweeping optimism as  they went from the bottom of the hierarchy to a respected group. Ultimately this is a huge missed potential that is also surprisingly not alot talked about in the community.

heres a lot more to say and criticize but I've reached my steam word limit... yeah that one sentence sums up the vicky 3 experience.

All in all this game just quite frankly sucks due to a lack of polish. Usually mod's fix this in other games but it is to severe in this game to fix. You need different major mods for every single aspect. I personally run the entire 5 or so Ultra Historical mods to fix research, combat and the lack of a historical ai. The better politics mod to make politics slightly less repetitive (they still are). Various Quality of life UI mods, performance improving mods, Event and Flavour mods. And always 1 Flavour mod for the nation Im planning to play.

And this won't be fixed within one update or a dlc, this will take a lot which is why I don't recommend it. If they keep the progress up, in 2 years I'd say this game enters a ""releasable bare bones"" state. As it is, you get a few hundred hours out of playing different nations and getting familiar with the game mechanics until you realize its all the same.

It does get better with every DLC but these improvements should be in the base game already. The only way this ""game"" is remotely fun is with having all the DLC's and it gets tiring to have to pay for the stuff that should have been present at the release. It's also ill-optimized and several stuff aren't very well balanced. You have to be a paradox veteran to like this game. I know this game will get better as time goes on but it has already been several years since its release and you still can't call this a proper game. | 闪退这一个问题能持续这么久不修复，每次更新之后必闪退 | 在几次大更新后，Vic3也总算有了发行时该有的样子。虽然到目前为止，军事系统仍旧和没有一个样。小国破局大多情况也是打防守反击，抱列强大腿。但是其他系统，仍旧有可圈可点之处。经济系统虽然慢慢在变的更好，但我仍旧希望能在将来的某个版本的更新中迎来大改，引入经济危机。毕竟没有经济危机的资本主义是不完美的（笑）"

Much better beginner experience in this one.. the super simple license test or whatever being a great intro to the concepts which then left me eager to start on hard to really scratch the brain itch.

The game is that perfect brain teaser in a visually pleasing package.. you look at a new shape and freak out at all the steps involved, then you design a factory that ends up being way more compact and efficient than you ever thought *feels good* and once that's delivered, you get introduced to the next layer of complexity.

It combines a campaign map with turn based battles. You can create your own civilization with its ruler and heroes, and play as the fantasy (or steam-punk) civilization you always wanted.

But I have some bigger issues with this game:

First off, since the last big update, the game has a tendency to crash on the campaign map. Which is really annoying, but dealbreaker for me is, that it also corrupts saves, so you cannot continue where it crashed. Especially annoying when you just fought a big battle and then lose all your progress.

Second is, that yes - you can create different civs - but in the end, they all play very similar. You always want to rush your city cap and just build as many armies as possible. Build wide, claim as much territory as possible. That's the strategy. The only difference is how your units look and what tomes you unlock. To be fair, some of the final tomes are very unique, but it takes a very long time till you get there and most of the game is already over by that point.

Third, the campaign map itself. You notice it is randomly generated. It's a combination of biomes with some features in it and some randomly placed ancient wonders. Every map looks similar. Sometimes it has more forest and sometimes more sand, but in the end, there are no ""unique"" landmarks or sights. After a few games, you have seen everything. Which would be okay, but one of the key points of this game is to go out and explore the map... which is just not interesting.

 | The game has a lot of fun customization and the actual combat is deep enough to be satisfying, but simple enough to be accessible. It's just a very well crafted game. My only gripe is that it falls into the trap of endless, expensive DLC that a lot of games of this nature fall into. | It's a good game. Early game is a blast. Middle game is so so. End game is boring.

I have the same problem with this game as with Total War series -- late game battles are boring and tedious, zero fun.

76561197999482693,220,Half-Life 2,0.0,Action,0,"A monumental game in my gaming career, Half-Life 2 was that defining experience that made me realise I was in for something next level. For the first time i picked it up on The Orange Box in 2008, and from the moment I booted it up, I knew I was in for a wild ride. It wasn’t just a game—it was an event. The environments were absolutely massive, the atmosphere was unreal, and the soundtrack? Edgy as hell. Every moment felt like a cinematic journey.

In Half-Life 2, you play as Gordon Freeman, arguably one of the most reluctant action heroes in gaming. You awaken from stasis, burdened with the trauma of the previous game, and are immediately thrust into action as the figurehead of an uprising. This isn’t a simple revolution—it’s a battle against a multiversal alien threat, shrouded in dystopian themes and orchestrated by secretive organizations manipulating events behind the scenes.

Set in a world dominated by the Combine, an alien regime that combines interdimensional authoritarianism with advanced technology, you must navigate a planet under their control. Armed with little more than a crowbar and your signature nonverbalism, Gordon becomes the key figure in the resistance. As you progress, you'll engage in intense combat, solve puzzles, explore diverse environments, and uncover the unsettling truth that nothing in this world is as it seems.

And let’s talk about The G-Man—a mysterious, interdimensional CIA glowman who pops up like a bad dream and probably controls the entire charade like a cosmic puppeteer. Is he good? Is he bad? Is he just playing the long game? Who knows, but he’s definitely got his hand in everything, watching Gordon like a hawk, pulling strings like an invisible god. 

You’d think it’s just a sci-fi conspiracy, but after a while, you start questioning if anyone really knows what the hell is going on. Does G-Man even have a purpose, or is he just a cosmic observer who gets his kicks out of watching a man with a crowbar take on the end of the world?

The game’s narrative feels like a giant puzzle, and each step forward opens up even more questions, all while you’re tearing through enemy lines, trying to get answers. And the best part? It’s not all about combat—there are puzzles to solve, mysteries to uncover, and a sense of isolation that keeps you on edge, constantly wondering who or what will show up next. The pacing is incredible, making you feel like you’re a tiny piece of something far larger, with consequences that span across dimensions.

Now when the episodes are combines (haha) The user experience is smooth and now it is even moddable! 5/5 | 之前20周年更新开发者评论模式后我又打了一遍，阀是怎样做到的，让我反复爱上它们的游戏。在游戏里跟开发者评论一起探索是我最喜欢的事，我喜欢看游戏开发历程和小故事，实在是让人大开眼界。

Released in 2004 by Valve, it redefined what players could expect from a video game in terms of both storytelling and gameplay. The game’s narrative is immersive, unfolding without traditional cutscenes, which allows the player to feel like they are truly part of the story. The protagonist, Gordon Freeman, is a silent hero who navigates through a dystopian world filled with alien invaders and oppressive human forces. This unique approach to storytelling pulls the player into the game’s world, making every action feel meaningful.

The physics engine in ""Half-Life 2"" was revolutionary for its time. The way objects interact with the environment feels natural and intuitive, and it became a major part of the gameplay. From solving puzzles using physics to creatively using the environment as a weapon, it was an innovation that influenced many games that followed. The gravity gun, which allows players to manipulate objects in real-time, is still one of the most memorable and fun weapons in gaming history.

The level design in ""Half-Life 2"" is another standout feature. The game introduces players to varied environments, from the dark, industrial city of City 17 to the eerie, remote marshlands. Each location feels carefully crafted, with attention to detail that makes the world feel alive. The pacing is also masterful, alternating between moments of intense combat and slower, atmospheric sequences that allow the player to soak in the environment and story.

The AI in ""Half-Life 2"" was also ahead of its time. Enemies behave intelligently, using cover, working together, and reacting to the player’s actions in a way that makes combat more dynamic and challenging. The enemy variety, from the terrifying Combine soldiers to the creepy headcrabs, keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging. The interactions with NPCs and the world around you help build a sense of tension and immersion, keeping you on edge throughout the experience.

The game's soundtrack, composed by Kelly Bailey, perfectly complements the atmosphere, using subtle but effective music to enhance both the action and the quieter moments. The sound design is top-notch, with ambient sounds adding to the immersion, whether you're in a busy city street or exploring a deserted warehouse.

Ultimately, ""Half-Life 2"" is a masterpiece that still holds up to this day. Its innovative gameplay, storytelling, and technical achievements make it a game that set a new standard for the industry. It’s a game that’s not just fun to play, but one that’s easy to appreciate for the way it shaped the future of video games. Even though it’s been years since its release, ""Half-Life 2"" remains a classic that continues to inspire both players and developers alike.

 | game is fire but whoever designed the puzzles and the vehicle section i hope you never work in games again. also barney thick as hell | Half-Life 2 is quite a game and i don't know what to say about it other than its a personal favourite. I think its one of my favourite of the Half-Life games just for all the upgrades it brings. The physics and all the new graphics and visuals. Its truly a great leap in the series and i love how far the story has come and how everything was ended nicely.

The story was more developed and the characters had more dialogue with each other and you saw some past characters return quite nicely. The aliens returned in this sequel to the first Half-Life and once again you had to beat them back. You are led through multiple chapters in the game defeating enemies and playing through some thought provoking puzzles as per the series standard.

One thing i miss is that the game ended on an unfortunate cliff hanger and so far there seems to be no sign of a sequel at all. The story needs finishing and has spent way to long without any news at all about its future and will be in limbo for some time.

The game without a doubt in my mind is the best in the series and one of my favourites. Its a easy game to recommend anyone try out and play in the future."

Half-Life: Deathmatch: Source is a multiplayer first-person shooter developed by Valve. It is a remake of the classic Half-Life deathmatch mode, utilizing the Source engine. The game combines the fast-paced action of traditional deathmatch with updated graphics and more fluid movement mechanics. While it successfully brings new life to the original concept, some mechanical issues and a niche player base prevent it from being as popular as its predecessors.

What Works Well?
🎮 Classic Deathmatch Gameplay
The core of Half-Life: Deathmatch is its tight, fast-paced combat. It stays true to the original deathmatch mode, offering classic weapons, high-speed action, and simple, enjoyable mechanics. The formula remains as fun today as it was when first introduced.

🌆 Updated Graphics with Source Engine
The move to the Source engine has significantly improved the visuals compared to the original. The lighting, textures, and models are much sharper, breathing new life into the iconic Half-Life universe. The environments feel more immersive, and physics interactions are more dynamic.

🔫 Familiar Weapon Set
Players have access to a variety of classic weapons from the Half-Life series, including the crowbar, shotgun, and crossbow, all of which perform as expected. Each weapon has its own strategic value, and they all function well within the confines of the deathmatch setting.

🛠️ Modding Support and Custom Servers
As with other Source engine games, Deathmatch: Source allows for a robust modding community. Players can easily find custom servers and user-created content, from new maps to modified gameplay modes, keeping the experience fresh.

What Could Be Better?
❌ Limited Popularity and Player Base
Despite its solid foundation, Half-Life: Deathmatch: Source suffers from a relatively small player base. As newer games in the genre continue to dominate, it can be difficult to find active matches, especially in more niche servers.

❌ Physics Can Feel Clunky
While the Source engine improved many aspects of the game, some of the physics—especially in terms of movement—can feel a little awkward compared to modern shooters. The transition to 3D space feels a bit more restrictive than anticipated, particularly when compared to the fluidity of more modern games.

❌ No Significant Gameplay Innovation
While the updated graphics and better physics are great, Deathmatch: Source doesn't introduce any major changes to the original formula. It feels more like a polished port rather than a revolutionary step forward for the genre. Players expecting something drastically new may be disappointed.

❌ Lack of Meaningful Progression
Like many classic deathmatch games, there’s a lack of meaningful progression or any form of unlockable content. While this keeps the focus on pure skill-based play, some players may miss the more modern systems that reward long-term engagement.

Conclusion
Half-Life: Deathmatch: Source is a solid multiplayer shooter for fans of the classic Half-Life experience. Its updated visuals and iconic weapons deliver the fun, high-speed action that fans love, but its small player base and lack of major innovation hold it back from achieving greater popularity. If you’re looking for nostalgic deathmatch action or enjoy modding, it’s a great choice, but don’t expect a revolutionary experience.

Rating: 7/10 – Fun for fans of classic shooters, but somewhat limited by its age and player base. 🎮💥 | It’s good and there are still servers if ur in europe buy it if ur not in eu you’ll probably have shit connection so don’t | 这老东西没人玩了，只能选人数不到两位数的服务器进去小玩一下。

On top of that training your character takes Real time not in game time so you can't get good by putting in a lot of hours, unless you spend a lot of money. That being said it's a very rewarding game at times.

Very PVP based because you can be killed everywhere. Learning how to survive more often is a skill in itself. It's hard to trust anyone in this game so if you find people to play with and build with (which i recommend), don't trust them too much. 
BEWARE! The fact everyone is behind a screen truly brings out the worst out in people, and the people in this game take their second life in EVE very very seriously. No lie some of the most toxic people i have EVER seen! This is offset by some people that give the absolute BEST help and introduction, but you're lucky to come across someone like that. 
One time i listed my 330 million ship as 33 million accidentally (which was a huge sum for a beginner like me) and after i messaged the guy he was extremely friendly and sent me the rest of the money.

I'm pretty sure it's only played by adults because of the time and money required to get to the mid-game. 
Regarding CCP games the developer, don't expect them to care, they have been trying to move away from EVE for the past 15 years, they're absolutely sick and tired of working on it, but all their other projects fail miserably.
Don't fly what you can't afford to lose, and if you can buy some starting funds or get them from a helping person. Not having to worry about losing some ships early on while you learn can make ALL the difference in your experience in this game. I would advise to not immediately try and get into Industry or Marketplace because it's one of the hardest things to get into because of the competition you have from well established manufacturers and traders.
Multiboxing is allowed and very much encouraged. EVE is pay to win all the way to the top :)

""Sounds like a skill issue to me.

if you watch dscan, local etc. you can easily avoid other people shooting you.

If you run missions in highsec i doubt it that you get permaganked.""

So if you're not into this sort of thing, don't know any of what the hell this nerd even means, and are not interested in watching/reading guides just to do quests that are non-pvp to try your best to avoid having your quest line literally bricked then this game is not for you. | The game is an abomination, it's main playerbase is built around finding the newest and inovative way to lie, cheat, screw over, and just plainly try and make your fellow players rage quit. If you're not a part of a guild you will not be able to survive. If you are part of a guild you will still not survive. If you're a new player you will definitely not survive, and you will most definitely be preyed upon continuously until you rage quit.
~This game is not about 3d spaceships going pew pew in space, its a Sociopath/Psychopath Simulator. If you're playing it for the video game and not to enhance your evil side, you're playing it wrong.
~This game is also about spreadsheets and looking at spaceships shoot at rocks for hours on end.
[i]~Legend has it Donald Trump was created in this game [/i] | My playtime ... 600 or so hours ... that's how long it takes to come to the realization that you're better off without this game. I think I'm going to return to Elite Dangerous actually, since you can flag on / off in that game and it is less a spreadsheet simulator and more a space flight simulator.

Eve has gone F2P, but has not bothered to enact the basic PvP flagging system that all other MMO games have. The kind which might attract new players, and retain players who are just sick of the nonsense. You know, adults with real lives who want to casually enjoy a game from time to time. The actual large market you'd think a company would seek out ... 

Do you enjoy feeding the trolls? If yes, play this game. Do you enjoy running from trolls? If yes, play this game. Are you a troll yourself? Then play this game, spend real life money to buy the skills and ships necessary to hunt and kill others, and enjoy.  Eve online turns one person's real life dollars into another person's frustration. It's a direct 1 to 1 relationship - the more real life dollars you spend, the more frustration you can inflict upon other people, and the more insulated you are yourself from the frustration others might inflict on you. Does that get you off? Then you've found your utopia. Link your credit card, and begin trolling other players. This developer has created a shadenfreude machine. It just costs a little bit of money. 

If you want a game to play, where you are able to enjoy playing - by engaging with the PvE elements and NPC's and missions and stories - and opt into PvP sometimes - this is not your game. 

This is 100% a PvP game, all the time and everywhere, and by installing, you are simply a target for the people who have been playing for years."

[b]Alquimia[/b]

O uso de poções não é opcional, é OBRIGATÓRIO. Neste jogo você precisa coletar itens como plantas e partes de animais, comprar e ler formulas para poções e óleos, crafta-los e usar de acordo com o contexto, inimigo e sua estratégia. Essas informações custam caro no jogo, tanto em tempo conversando com npcs quanto em ouro para comprar as formulas. 

[b]Inimigos e Combates[/b]

A parte mais divertida para mim e mais odiada para outros. No jogo você possui uma espada de prata e uma de aço, além de 3 estilos de combate, você precisa usar a arma certa no estilo de combate certo contra o inimigo certo, e juntamente com isso combinar a magia e alquimia para explorar as fraquezas dos adversários, isso é fundamental especialmente nos chefes. 

Os pontos fracos dos monstros e chefes do jogo também não são de graça, você precisa comprar livros, e falar com npcs para descobri-los, o que você pode facilmente perder durante a progressão do game ou simplesmente ficar sem dinheiro para adquirir as informações, deixando o game mais difícil e menos rico em termos de lore. De posse da informação você precisa ficar consultado o codex do jogo para elaborar as estratégias de combate. 

As coisas não explicitas no codex, por exemplo, ele diz que o chefe do primeiro capitulo é pouco vulnerável a magia Aard, se você se deu o trabalho de aprender ou usar a magia Aard em combate sabe que ela tonteia os inimigos possibilitando que você os mate com um só golpe. 

De posse dessas duas informações você pode elaborar a estratégia de fortalecer o Aard para matar o chefe ""super difícil"" do capitulo 1 com apenas um golpe.  Mas cabe ao jogador chegar nesta conclusão e planejar com antecedência. Parece algo simples mas a maioria dos jogadores não o fazem pois jogam irrefletidamente. [b]The Witcher não vai te pegar pela mão. cabe a você pegar os insumos que o jogo te oferece para ter uma boa experiência[/b].

[b]História[/b]

A lore da série witcher dispensa comentários, só não posso deixar de mencionar que em diversos momentos o jogo tem coloca entre escolhas morais de fritar a cabeça. Você sempre se pega tentando entender qual a coisa certa até se dar conta que no jogo não existe isto de coisa certa, e que ninguém é inocente.

Uma coisa importante é que a história avança de forma inesperada, é normal coisas ficarem para trás na primeira jogada, sempre tenha isso em mente ao entrar em um lugar ou completar uma quest, as vezes o jogo avança e algumas quests não podem ser completadas, outras o jogador acaba deixando passar. Desta forma o jogo tem um valor alta para quem for re-jogar. | Après avoir fini le jeu en 63h, je ne peux que le recommander.

-  la fluidité des mouvements n'est pas celle d'un jeu de 2019

""Gerekli laf söyleme kısmını geçtiğimi göre şimdi oyundan bahsedebiliriz""

Her şeyin başlangıcı olarak verilmese de karakteri tanımamız ve hikayeyi anlayabilmemiz için gerekli oyun olarak karşımıza çıkıyor Witcher 1.

Çok güzel bir senaryo hazırlanmış öncesi hakkında bir fikrimiz yok sonrası ise tamamen muamma ilerledikçe kendimize ve hikayeye dair ip uçları ediniyor ve bir şekilde kafamızda yaşananları şekillendirmeye başlıyoruz.

[spoiler]Oyunun en başında karşımıza çıkan çocuğun en sonunda karşımıza çıkacağını kim bilebilir ki ?[/spoiler]

Oyun sırasında çok fazla npc ile diyalog kurabiliyor ana karakterimiz adına seçim yapmamız gereken çok fazla sahne ile karşılaşıyoruz.

Yetenek ağacı ise gerçekten harika oynamak istediğiniz stile yatırım yaptıkça harika kombolar ve hızlandırmalar sunuyor.

Dövüş sistemi sanıldığının aksine birazcık refleks birazcık dikkatli oynamak mantığında ilerliyor yeterli upgrade'leri alırsanız karşınızdaki 10 kişiyi havada 5 takla atarak inanılmaz artist şekillerde kesebiliyorsunuz.

Görev mantığı ise harika tüm oyunlarında olduğu gibi hangisinin side hangisinin main quest olduğunu size veriyor ve en önemli kısmı o görevleri yapabilmek için sadece bulunduğunuz haritada değil başka haritalara gidip gelebiliyorsunuz.

""Emek veriyorsunuz""

Bu oyun için gerçekten emek veriyorsunuz eski olmasına rağmen tek bir anında bile beni sıkmayan başından saatlerce kalkmadığım bir oyun oldu Witcher benim için.

Her anında insanları tek tek tanımak hikayelerini dinlemek yeri geldiğinde sarhoş olup ağzınlarından laf almak yeri geldiğinde genel evdeki kızlara çiçek götürmek her anı ile gerçekten harika bir oyun Witcher 1.

Yaptığım seçimler sırasında gerçekten zorlandığım noktalar oldu ben olsam ne yapardım Gerald aslında ne yapar kısımlarında bazı seçim ekranlarında oturup düşünmüşlüğüm var ve her şeyin sonunda tamamen benim verdiğim kararlara göre şekillenmiş bir son çıktı karşıma.,

Oyun beni tatmin etti mi ? Fazlasıyla..
Oyundan keyif aldım mı ? İnanılmaz derece..
Peki oyunun grafikleri çok mu kötü ? Hayır kesinlikle değil
Peki oyunun combat sistemi çok mu saçma ya da çok mu zor ? Hayır aslında inanılmaz basit
Peki gerçekten hikayeyi anlamak için ilk oyunu oynamamız mı gerekiyor ? ""EVET""

Neden bu kadar agresif cevaplar veriyorum ? şu yüzden..

Oyuna başladığım günün sabahında Discord da masum masum oyunu oynuyorken discordda ki arkadaşlarımızdan birisi yanıma geldi ve sırf Enis K. isimli youtuber'ın videosunu izlediği için abi o oyuna rework şart yaa gibisinden bir cümle kullandı..
Mikrofondan yumruk atabilmeyi gerçekten çok isterdim..

İlk oyunu oynamana gerek yok diğer oyunlarda hikayeyi anlayabiliyorsun diyen arkadaşlarım dostlarım..
İlk oyunda öldürüp öldürmemenin kararı sana bırakılmış karakterler diğer oyunda sırf senin yaptığın seçime göre karşına çıkabiliyorken..
3. Oyunda dahi diyaloğa gireceğimiz karakterlerin başlangıç hikayelerini ilk oyunda öğrenirken..
Firma oyunun hikayesinin temelini ilk oyunda yaptığını açıklamışken ne demek lan ilk oyunu oynama diğer oyunlarda anlaşılıyor ??

Düşünsene Matrix'i öneriyorsun arkadaşına ve diyorsun ki ilk film'i izleme adam işte Matrix oluyor..
Lan oluyor da o sırada yaşadıkları ne oluyor ? o etrafındaki insanlar nereden geliyor ? o herif Matrix olana kadar neler çekiyor ?

Oyun indirim döneminde ciklet parasına kadar düşüyorken lütfen alıp kendiniz tecrübe edin..
Yine beğenmezseniz ben hep buradayım. Oturur konuşur tartışırız.


Dikkat: "" Bu incelemeyi okurken yorum ekranında bol bol devrik cümle, erken bitirilmiş diyaloglar ve açıklamalarda yumuşatılma hissedebilirsiniz. İnsanlara atar yapmamam gerektiğini kendime söyleyerek yazmış birisi olarak bu açıklamayıp da yapma gereksinimi duydum "" 

Teşekkürler.

Ви коли-небудь хотіли пограти щось в епоху чистого, я маю на увазі без магічних штук, середньовіччя? Якщо так, то ця гра саме те, що потрібно. Тут є досить великий відкритий світ, гра не заганяє в рамки, ви можете робити все що спаде на думку і бути будь-ким: розбійником, найманцем, торговцем, лордом або кинути виклик усім і стати володарем власного королівства, а згодом і королем усієї Кальрадії. З часом гра починає набридати, тоді на сцену виходять модифікації, це є ще одним великим плюсом. У вас є можливість перетворити гру на будь-що, від сонячного ""Дикого заходу"" і моторошних земель ""Володаря перснів"", до космічних просторів із всесвіту ""Зоряних війн"".

Ця гра сильно затягує, тому якщо вона вам сподобається, то з великою ймовірністю у перші дні буде награно кілька десятків годин. Серйозно, мені було важко з неї вийти, постійно в голові складав план, наприклад, ось завершу цей квест і виходжу, а в цей момент на карті з'являлися кілька лутерів і я такий ""перемагаю їх і на сьогодні досить"", але потім все затяглося на кшталт зроблю це, зроблю то, продам то, знищу тих, бах і замок в осаді... Дивлюся, а надворі вже ніч і треба лягати спати. Спочатку я взагалі думав зайти побігати трохи, зробити кілька знятків і вийти. І я набігав аж 130 годин за кілька тижнів.

Дивлячись на негативні рецензії, то 75% з них є просто через те, що існує M&B Warband, як на мене це не зовсім справедливо, але я розумію їх, він дійсно краще, як з технічного стану так і візуально, і так, я [b]РЕКОМЕНДУЮ[/b] починати з Warband, але не слід забувати, що оригінальний M&B це по суті його фундамент і обзивати його лохом через те, що у нього є менший брат, який набагато кращий у всьому, я не можу.

Українізатора для M&B на жаль немає, але в цій ситуації я не впевнений, чи він взагалі потрібен, як я писав вище, краще починати з Warband, Українізатор для якого є.

[h1]7 полонених королів з 10[/h1] | Mount & Blade – це унікальна серія, яка втілює мрію кожного гравця про свободу у відкритому середньовічному світі. Розроблена турецькою студією TaleWorlds Entertainment, гра стала справжнім подарунком для любителів стратегій, ролевих ігор та епічних битв. Незважаючи на відсутність глянцю великих ААА-проєктів, Mount & Blade захоплює своєю глибиною та неповторним шармом.

Свобода вибору
Однією з найбільших переваг Mount & Blade є повна свобода дій. Ви починаєте як невідомий мандрівник і можете стати ким завгодно: найманцем, торговцем, лордом чи навіть королем власного королівства. Гравець має змогу самостійно вирішувати, як писати свою історію в світі Калрадії – фентезійного середньовічного континенту, наповненого політичними інтригами, війнами та нескінченними можливостями.

Бойова система
Mount & Blade відома своєю реалістичною та динамічною бойовою системою. Битви відбуваються в реальному часі, і від вашої майстерності залежить результат кожного поєдинку. Можливість брати участь у масштабних битвах, керувати загоном чи навіть стати героєм, який змінить хід війни, дарує незабутні враження. Ви відчуєте всю вагу меча, точність стріл і потужність кавалерійської атаки.

Стратегічні елементи
Крім бойових аспектів, Mount & Blade пропонує широкий спектр стратегічних можливостей. Ви можете формувати власну армію, керувати ресурсами, будувати економічні ланцюжки та укладати дипломатичні угоди. Захоплення міст і замків, боротьба за політичний вплив та управління підданими додають глибини ігровому процесу.

Атмосфера та світ
Калрадія – це світ, сповнений життя, історій і конфліктів. Різні фракції, культури та політичні амбіції створюють динамічне середовище, де кожна дія гравця впливає на подальший розвиток подій. Атмосфера середньовіччя відчувається у всьому: від музичного супроводу до деталей одягу та архітектури.

Особливості серії
Mount & Blade: Warband – вершина класичної серії, яка додала мультиплеєр і розширила можливості для створення власного королівства.
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord – довгоочікуване продовження, яке зберегло дух оригіналу, але вивело графіку, механіку та масштабність гри на новий рівень.
Графіка та технічні аспекти
Хоча графіка Mount & Blade не є найсильнішою стороною серії, це з лишком компенсується глибоким геймплеєм і багатством можливостей. Своєрідна естетика додає шарму та допомагає зосередитися на головному – на грі.

Модифікації – душа Mount & Blade
Окремої уваги заслуговують моди. Спільнота фанатів створила величезну кількість модифікацій, які додають нові фракції, епохи та навіть змінюють сеттинг гри. Хочете опинитися у Середзем’ї з ""Володаря перснів"" чи перенестися у світ вікінгів? Завдяки модам це можливо.

Загальне враження
Mount & Blade – це гра, яка дає вам більше, ніж ви очікуєте. Вона не хапає зірок із неба у графіці чи постановці, але її глибина, свобода та реалістичність роблять її однією з найкращих у своєму жанрі. Це проєкт для тих, хто любить виклики, стратегії та хоче творити власну історію у світі середньовіччя.

Оцінка: 9/10
Mount & Blade – це гра для душі, яка вимагає часу, але нагороджує незабутніми враженнями. | ilk m&b.

also the music in this game is a lot better than it is in the second, much more industrial and gritty, plus no shitty korn-ripoff vocals talking about abortion and god. the audio design in general is just better imo... guns sound amazing. even the 9mm has a punchy and satisfying sound that never gets old, say what you want about tripwire but they know how to make guns sound, look, and FEEL great, red orchestra 2 is a great example of that. 

also, this game is not afraid to punish you with some hefty recoil, which is really nice and adds a solid challenge. i wouldn't call the gunplay ""realistic"" but it is close enough that it feels pretty damn good. the devs managed to make you feel weak at times, but also strong and badass as hell at other points. shooting the patriarch's limbs off with dual handcannons never gets old."

A Solid 9/10 and absolute classic. Have loved it since it first came out and now later in life. I just wish one issue technically/strategically/in terms of game design was fixed. If this was fixed the game would be perfect 10/10. 

As you build up your army organically against the King its population value can sometimes too drastically lower Rebel Sentiment to initiate the Revolution. So you could have towns that are in the high 90% of being pro Independence and being ready to go yet the Overall Score is stuck in the low 30%. This is completely lopsided and after I did everything right with the right buildings, founding fathers etc. 

In essence it's too much of a trade-off between growing your population/army along with maintaining the popularity needed to initiate the revolution. This SHOULD NOT BE A TRADE OFF! This catch 22 problem means you can't win the game as reasonably due to Strategy/Design Error. The best way to fix this is to remove Military Units from the calculation of Rebel Sentiment entirely. 

I have made comments on this issue in forms, on STEAM, along with others. Yet it doesn't seem to be fixed anytime soon. Sad given such a great game."

My memory of this game, of playing it off a CD, is that you could read an entire comic book waiting for a new level to load. Unfortunately that's the part of the game that has been preserved here. Bugs galore, including having actions edge off screen and characters 'dropping' through buildings making them unmovable or un-engagable. What was fun about this game originally was the campy concept and bright colors. It doesn't look right now. The bright colors and comic book dashes and dots with this early animation style doesn't scream page-turning immersive world. It's like a cheap, superficial game you'd get on a cellphone. 

The missions can be painfully simplistic and there isn't a sense of team building or world building. Your reward is largely your own imagination as you earn enough to unlock 'sets' of abilities or skills. If you're someone who wants the nostalgia either from the original release or from the really, really old comics, this might scratch the itch. If you have even slightly high standards informed by modern games, you'll be disappointed. 

The idea that something this simplistic came out in the same era as the Halo games or even the early Civilization games is a little shocking to contemplate. The people who designed it loved Patriot City and some of the 1980's kind of super villain tropes. They had fun with this, clearly, I just don't think it aged well and given the depth of both missions and conceptual design of other early 2000's games I remain shocked it was ever reviewed and ranked so highly. 

I guess get it if it's on sale or you're really, really curious about what people did when they weren't playing Quake back in the day."

Oblivion isn't a game that you play. Oblivion is a game that you conquer.
Yes, the graphics and mechanics haven't aged well. Yes, the dialogue is often hilariously unhinged. And yes, the game is ripe with bugs and quest breaking sequences that induce a paranoid amount of saving. But its' defects can also be broken in your favor. THAT realization is when the game grips you:
What can you get away with? What cheese tactics, what exploits, or what innocuous and obscure thing (like picking up and dropping a paintbrush from your inventory... this is not a joke) can you leverage to your adventure— and how far can you leverage it? And there's so much to be adventured: every nook and cranny or every dungeon, achieve and ace every quest, grind every attribute and skill to max, collect every unique item, and then, after a 100+ hours... lament that it's over.

Which brings us to those who are returning to this title:
You know as well as I that this game has near to no replay value. Everything Oblivion has to offer can be experienced in a single playthrough, and the narrative has little to no variation (nor any substantial dialogue or narrative choices for those hopping for more RP in their RPG like the CRPGs that predated it).

It can be a hell of a ride, but with a story you can only fully revel in once, as a fresh player.
Otherwise you're only left to recall the insatiable desire to see and do everything until the memory of your previous experience is restored, which quickly dulls the experience.
However, on a personal note, I will add: that one thing I recalled was that this was one of the few games that truly made me feel as though I were fighting an endless army of demons; running, jumping, and cutting through one Oblivion gate after another...
And I felt it still, even years after its' initial release.
May it make you feel such heartiness as well. | its a nightmare to make this game stable. but its SUPER modable so you can alter it in any way you want like a sandbox. i recommend your learn the modding tools they are easy and you can make a lot of fun stuff for roleplay etc. and despite the goofiness it can be an engaging story, deep lore and great questlines.

It is a sandbox environment that starts you out on the island that the main city is in, in the center of the map. Each city has a different architectural theme, and a house that you can purchase if you have enough gold and meet the other criteria. The interface is far better than both its predecessor, Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, and its successor, Elder Scrolls IV: Skyrim. The character design is also superior to both, as they did away with character classes in Skyrim.

Verdikt: Section 8 vcelku slušnou FPS hrou s originálnymi prvkami. Singleplayer je krátky a slúži skôr ako tréning pre multiplayer. Po technickej stránke je na tom hra veľmi dobre. Grafika a efekty sú na slušnej úrovni. Vrámci singleplayeru potešia aj príbehové videá, ktoré príjemne spestrujú atmosféru hry. Jadrom hry je multiplayer, ktorý sa vydaril a je naozaj zábavný. Mapy sú rozľahlé, miestami síce pusté, ale celkovo pôsobia epicky. Negatívom hry sú problémy s Windows LIVE. Zakomponovať do hier niečo tak otravné, nedorobené a pokazené je iba na príťaž. V hre by mohlo byť aj viacej zbraní. Ich aktuálny počet ako základ postačuje, ale pre lepšie možnosti hrania by sa ich množstvo mohlo kľudne aj zdvojnásobiť. Section 8 je určená pre fanúšikov FPS so sci-fi tématikou, ktorá nemôže naplno konkurovať gigantom tohto žánru, ale svojich hráčov si určite dokáže získať.

70% | Mainly MP game with a short, fun (except for the escort mission) campaign primarily intended as a tutorial.

The dev is out of business, all the servers are down, and the game is soon to be crippled by the imminent shutdown of GFWL.

Stay away! | This review was written on January 23, 2011.

The single player is a 3 hour long generic campain, and the multiplayer is long dead and there is no one to play with. Big waste of money even with a big sale. Some promising ideas but Section 8 ends up being way too generic with a dead multiplayer. 

NOT recommended.

PROS

- Dropping from the skies instead of respawning is cool
- Somewhat good cinematics
- All things considered, multiplayer is good and has its own flavor.

CONS

- Campaign is 3-4 hours short, story is shallow, the whole single player aspect is unsatisfying.
- Below average level design. It feels too big most of the time, and even if the scenary looks good (the sky above and the smoke on the horizon), things that are immediately close to you like guns, armors, buildings, and such are generic.
- DEAD multiplayer. As I write this, there are exactly 5 multiplayer servers online, 4 of which are empty. 
- Contrary to the cinematics, the art ingame is mostly bland.

REVIEW

There is not much to say about Section 8. 

The campaign is short and shallow, only 3-4 hours long. When I beat up a mission and seen the credits roll, I was amazed as I thought i was barely 1/4th of the way and just finishing the introduction phase waiting for a greater, more interesting plot to surface. Very disapointed on that aspect. 

If the multiplayer was still alive, I'd give this game a 7 instead of a 5. It has a single mode that is similar to domination (control areas), but it has a nice innovation that is the dynamic objectives. Escorting convoys, fetching intel, or either protection or killing VIPs at random keeps things interesting. But unfortunately it has been a while since the multiplayer fell from the skies and cracked its skull on the hard, cold concrete. Playing with 32 people is fun, but right now there is barely a handful of servers online, most of them empty, and the ones populated have barely a few players on and mostly bots.

CONCLUSION

Because of the dead multiplayer, right now there is no reason to buy this game anymore... unless you find it for 5$ or so, and even then it would still be a questionable purchase.

I'd skip this game entirely. | На первый взгляд Section 8 очень хорошо сложена и имеет задатки. Заглавная музыкальная тема от маэстро Джейсона Грейвса так и вообще – внушает надежду. Но вот с масштабом разработчики просчитались – в Section 8 слишком мало новых идей и разнообразия, чтобы претендовать на место в сердцах игрового сообщества. Быть может, в будущем TimeGate учтет свои ошибки, а пока – имеем то, что имеем. | Actually surprisingly awesome!  The jet pack mechanic is not quite as good as Tribes but apart from that it does actually feel like a Tribes 3. The battles also feel very “Battlefield”-like which definitely goes in its favour.

Particularly love the 'burn-in' mechanic which always manages to make a respawn feel awesome. The sub-mission mechanic also really livens up the traditional area control maps.  The building mechanic also works well. Certainly enough innovative ideas here to make this a must have. 

Only downsides are that unfortunately the community is quite small with only a few servers. Can’t really blame this on the game though, it deserves a lot attention than it gets. The vehicles could be more interesting too, but they are functional enough. Furthermore inventory management certainly could learn a lot from Tribes

This game is brilliant at allowing you pull of cinematic manoeuvres that leave you feeling awesome.

76561197999482693,40300,Risen,0.5,RPG,0,"Для меня risen в первую очередь - это платок, которым утирают слезы появившееся от воспоминаний по старой доброй готике. Я бы не осилил игру, если бы не проходил ту самую готическую трилогию, от которой у меня по сей день витают воспоминания. Рекомендую игру для любителей классической готики. | steam keeps asking if i recommend this game and frankly, i’m not sure. i had genuine fun with it for about 50 hours, but i kind of suffered through the last 10. why? because at its core, it’s a solid Piranha Bytes game meaning the hardcore beginning and the lengthy first act (easily half the game) are the best parts. you know, all that classic routine: learning the world’s rules, figuring out who the baddest baddie is, and choosing a faction to side with. running errands for some sketchy hombres. exploring caves and shores, only to get smashed on the head by a random ostrich (or whatever the hell those things are). getting bullied by the bullies at first and bullying them later. mugging and getting mugged. waking up NPCs in the middle of the night just to pester them with dumb questions. waiting until nightfall just to use the smithy because, during the day, those bulky blacksmith bastards hog it nonstop, leaving you waiting for a turn that will never come. sound familiar? that’s because this game is basically [i]Gothic[/i], just in a slightly different setting with much better graphics. plus, Kai Rosenkranz composed the ambient music for this one too, and his tunes really hit close to home.

BUT, the first time you try to take on some lizardmen, you’ll realize the combat is janky as hell. all those action points you invested in sword fighting? they don’t mean dreck because those bastards block [i]everything[/i]. every fight becomes a battle of wills: me vs. the will to keep enduring this suffering. and then, when you’ve finished all the open world stuff and only the plot missions remain, you’ll remember: the main story is the weakest part of the game. it’s just uninteresting and painfully boring. again. yep guys, this is truly a Piranha Bytes game. also, i was surprised to see in the credits that Andy Serkis, Lena Headey and Johnathan Rhys-Davies contributed voice work. why? because the acting [i]felt[/i] kind of uninspired. or maybe the writing was so generic and dull that i ended up skipping most of the dialogue and missed everything. who knows?

to wrap this up: after all i do recommend playing this game because Piranha Bytes knows how to create an engaging, tightly packed open world. but beware, it’s an old game, and it has its fair share of jank. actually, quite a lot of jank. but hey, let’s admit it, that’s part of its charm. | Игра просто разрыв очка! Давно меня с игр так не бомбило, это просто словами не описать. Система боя и враги это что-то с чем-то. Сложность игры относится только к тебе, врагам на нее похрен, так же как и на характеристики твоей брони. Вероятность блока врага - 90%, будешь метелить одного ящера до потери пульса, а стоит ему попасть по тебе - это  либо крит и шот на 300 ХП. Арбалеты в этой игре как комары носорогу, они бесполезны. Арбалетом ты будешь лупить 1 врага минут 10, это еще не самого сильного, в то время как с мечом можно хотябы на 1/5 HP снести в случае если пройдет крит, но это не точно. Бой против 2-3 врагов это танцы с бубном, тебя просто закликивают ударами со всех сторон как изменники Цезаря.  Не сохраняйтесь в этой игре во время боя, ибо игра запускается раньше чем окно загрузки и ты увидишь просто свой труп. Играл только из-за атмосферы пришедшей прямиком из Готики. В готике 1 управление было наверно лучше чем здесь и я не шучу! 1 Ящер из 10 . | Да, понравилось. Может по началу сложно вникнуть, но стоит разобраться и пошло-поехало. Игра награждает исследование и возвращение, потому что в некоторые места не так просто попасть. Рекомендую играть в версию publicbeta, потому что статистика достижений считается корректно и избегается ряд багов. И ещё: не убивать живность сразу, а по возможности избегать, чтобы в будущем после получения нужных инструментов и разделки получить больше трофеев. Достижения не очень сложные. Yes, I liked it. It may be difficult to understand at first, but it's worth figuring it out. The game rewards exploration and return because some places are not so easy to get to. I recommend playing the public beta version, because achievement statistics are considered correct and a number of bugs are avoided. And one more thing: do not kill animals immediately, but avoid them if possible, so that in the future, after receiving the necessary tools and cutting, you can get more trophies. And be saved more often. Achievements are not very difficult. | After playing the Gothic series, this game, its characters and the landscape ring a bell in the memories and warms the heart."

- The upcoming Gothic game will be very different from this teaser.
- The combat and graphics of Gothic have been shown in videos and they are completely different from this ""test"" teaser.
- The hero will come back. Both the hero and Diego have been completely changed between 2019 and 2025. On release they'll look nothing like this teaser.
- The Teaser itself is decent, hero talks too much. The devs said they did that on purpose to get some feedback.

I recommend giving it a try just to experience something different. | As someone who has never played a Gothic game before I have to admit that the game looks very promising but atleast the playtest does still have some problems. (The game says I only played 0,1h but In fact I actually played over an hour offline because I had no connection, that was also the reason why I played it) 

1. Audio - It seems like that they still need to fix the audio because the conversations dont feel natural. Characters make breaks while talking where it doesnt make any sense. 

2. Bug - I guess you could say this is a bug because whenever I killed those meatbugs and looted them, the dead bodies of them were still glowing, even through buildings. When I was at the tower for the fire I still saw those dead meatbugs glow through every single wall.

3. Graphics - They look decent but there is still room for improvement but overall they are totally fine.

4. No syncro? - Im from austria so I do speak german and I do know for a fact that Gothic is famous for his german voiceover, I guess they just didnt implement it in the Playtest.

5. Fighting - Im not really a big fan how the game wants you to fight, I guess its something you have to get used to but its something new.

76561197999482693,17450,Dragon Age: Origins,31.783333333333335,RPG,0,"I would have never discovered this incredible series if not through reccomendation, and I can say with complete certainty that I would have missed out on an incredible adventure. The Dragon Age series is wonderful dark fantasy adventure full of heart, danger, and tense comraderies, and Origins kicks it all off with an amazing premise.

The Fifth Blight has fallen upon Thedas. An incursion of darkspawn monsters, led by a powerful archdemon, is on the horizon. It is up to the Grey Wardens, sworn defenders against the Blights, to save the realm. It is up to You, Warden, to save your country alongside questionable companions, performing poilitical favours, and exploring the world from outside your sheltered origin. All of this, whilst grappling with the question; Is Ferelden even worth saving?

As the name of the game suggest; this a tale of origins. Most specifically; yours, as you have 6 different origin stories to choose from (Noble, Clansperson, Urchin, Commoner, Scholar, Outlander), each intrinsically based on your chosen race and class. The Dragon Age world is one fall of cruel stygmatisation, with no exceptions; not even you, player, are immune to discriminations and priveleges of this world, and that adds wonderfully dreadful realism. As you explore the world, and discover the rules of this unfair world, you feel it because you placed into it, in an incredibly real way.

And that's just the character creation, and the origin stories that you can play through. Once you've experienced the first two chapters of this fantastical tragedy, you develop a clear picture of what this world is like, and how hard it is going to be to help it into the light, all whilst darkness creeps in from the Kocari Wilds, and the Blighted monsters march to consume your home.

You will meet incredible companions, each from their own walks of life. With customs, attitudes and struggles that are all so unique you will grow to love them all, but only agree with a few. The approval system, an iconic staple of Bioware's adventure games, makes every choice of words and action, alter the perception your troops have of you individually. Some decision can even cause a drastic split in your group dynamic that shakes up your experience. What's more the dialogue that takes place behind the Warden's back is always a lovely treat.

In terms of character, story, world, and the ""choices matter"" genre, Dragon Age: Origins is an absolutely masterclass of writing. However, for me the biggest flaw of the game is the combat. The bones of it are absolutely brilliant; the tactical camera, the tactic loadout system, and the pause-to-command features are innovative and wonderfully executed. But what makes it all fall flat for me is how sluggish the combat itself is. The game grounds every aspect, apart from the fantasy, in realism. Drawing and loosing arrows takes time, swinging around swords and hammers takes time, accurate and forcefully stabbing someone in the back takes time, and that time feels so drawn out, and tiresome due to this realism. Even the speed of characters in combat is realistically, and painfully, slowed down, meaning it takes my warriors and rogues far too long to make it from one opponent to the next. What's more, because of this realism, being limited to 4 characters per combat (one of which HAS to be your character), the opponent will almost always have the action economy advantage.

Whilst this is my one major gripe about the game, and it is a hefty part of a GAME to complain about. It does not ruin the experience for me. I love building my team up to face this tough (tiringly slow) battles. I love clearing the numerous dungeons for loot, secrets, and the mysteries each quest presents. I love battling, or talking, or bartering my way to these climatic moments, at least two of which in each region, that will shape the fate of not only, the country but the entire world.

After all, this is Dragon Age: Origins. It is only the beginning of an entire history that you, the player - over the course of FOUR amazing games - will shape. | Потеряло актуальность с выпуском Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition. | The best DA | Un jeu qu'il est bien. | 10/10"

In general, this is not the only thing that can give you emotions, the game itself is very variable: this concerns both your backstory and your choice in certain actions, you are the creator of your story and what its outcome will be depends only on you.

Pros:
☑️🔝 An epic story with saving the world, where you are the chosen one and your decisions will determine what the ending will be, as well as a number of other important events. The right to choose, as in RPG games, is not an empty phrase here as in the finale of Mass Effect 3; 
☑️🔝 Well-written and interesting characters;
☑️🔝 Dialogues and the variability of their choices give exquisite pleasure;
☑️🔝 The ability to create a character and choose what your backstory will be;
☑️🔝 Interesting character leveling system. I found it very interesting to fight and level up my character;
☑️🔝 The atmosphere, music are top notch here;
☑️🔝 The ability to install mods.

And also many many other advantages, each of which is native and special for each person.

Even before the Steam version, I spent countless hours here, I spent many hours on certain events in the game, replayed this fantastic game many times. This game gave me so many pleasant and positive emotions that words are not enough to describe everything I feel about this game. I love the first part and consider this game the best from the BioWare studio. There was nothing better from them and perhaps there never will be. I would also add the first and second parts of Mass Effect as well as Jade Empire here. | 不敢玩龙腾2和审判，是因为不想看到那个有时天真、有时腹黑，聊起漂亮鞋子会蹦蹦跳跳，表达感情坦坦荡荡的Leliana就此身居幕后，成为主角团的引路人，关键是与灰卫再无瓜葛。也许世界观如此，所以灰卫无论如何不能有个好结局（作为男人当国王除外，因为我不可能选男主控就无视掉了），也无论如何不能与爱人长相厮守。那位有着火红头发的吟游诗人常常入我梦里，我无数次想要打开DA2的手都停了下来，我的DAO永远停在打完蕾莉安娜之歌的那个下午。当年我玩质量效应时也有这样的感情，但毕竟主角没换，两人都活着就能再见面，即使不再是队友。可是DA不一样，我无法停止害怕遇到性情大变的Leliana，也许我打开DA2的那天，是我终于停止爱她的那天吧。 | 虽然画面和手感落后，但剧情和游玩体验胜过现在很多大作。玩完以后意犹未尽，大概还因为最后主角希腊英雄般的一剑，波澜壮阔的一生，未尽之语，颠沛流离，从此不必再提

路过的薛姐：在说我吗？ | Dragon age: Origins, woah there's a game. If Skyrim is the guy in high-school all the girls wanted to date, but was really just average, and Fable was the nerdy awkward foreign exchange student all the juniors tried to bang, then where is dragon age? 

Dragon age is the 6' 8"" monstrosity of a man that fingered your girlfriend on prom night. No one expects Dragon age origins. DA is the guy that looms in the background dark and mysterious, but after hitting the showers fresh off an intense PE class, DA walks through to his locker butt-ass naked, with his full 10.3"" flaccid hog swinging freely.

That is to say, Dragon Age is bold. The game has mature subject matter dealing with death on massive scales, racism, class based societies, deception, grotesque body horror, and enough S.V.U. crime to keep Benson and Stabler employed for at least 3 lifetimes. Seriously, look at brood mothers and tell me DA didn't earn that mature rating. 

But dragon age is a complex character, just like Jack Reacher, Dragon age isn't just a brute. The game is extremely adept at exploring plot points in immersive and clever ways. Handles scenes that need finesse and understanding with expertise, and does a great job of both showing and telling the player about the world around them. But more than that, dialogue decisions and direct actions carry weight and will have repercussions later into the game. 

If you like well written and immersive RPG's that stick with you well past their run times then check out Dragon Age: Origins at your earliest convenience. 

 | The best Dragon Age, dont know what happened to Bioware but this  game is gem. Unfortunetly dont work anymore on my PC, but I will always have good memories about old Bioware."

 | The game also comes with a DLC, which includes the following items:

1. A Toxic Community: Mistakes are rarely forgiven. Unless you’re playing with friends, be prepared to face harsh criticism, often from younger players. The game’s multiplayer is largely populated by school-aged players who don’t hold back.


2. Disruptive Adults: It’s not just the kids causing chaos—some adults blast music through their microphones, assuming everyone else shares their taste. Spoiler: they don’t.


3. Frequent AFKs: Teamwork can fall apart when a teammate goes inactive, whether they’re brewing tea, taking a smoke break, or simply wandering off mid-game. And yes, it often happens right after you’ve generously used your first aid kit on them.


4. Team Abandonment: Lone wolves running off to the far corners of the map, only to be overwhelmed by infected, are a common sight. They’re quick to flood the chat with colorful language before rage-quitting the game.


5. Difficulty Disputes: Some players join games on ""Expert"" difficulty only to demand a downgrade. If their request is denied, they might sabotage the team before leaving the server entirely.


6. Vote Kicks: Occasionally, you’ll encounter players who inexplicably start a vote to kick you from the game. When you ask why? Crickets.



The Verdict: Despite the chaotic community, Left 4 Dead 2 remains a phenomenal experience. The graphics are a significant step up from the first game, the mechanics feel more polished, and there’s a greater variety of weapons and infected to enjoy. However, surviving the online experience without a calming remedy might be just as challenging as surviving the zombie apocalypse itself. | Крутая игра для игры с друзьями (которые в это не играют)!

Featuring intense survival gameplay, smart AI, and an incredible atmosphere, L4D2 delivers an unmatched multiplayer experience. With its fast-paced action, diverse weapons, and unpredictable enemy encounters, this game remains one of the most thrilling and replayable co-op shooters ever made.

Gameplay – Pure, Adrenaline-Fueled Action
L4D2 is all about co-op survival. You and three teammates must fight through hordes of the undead, navigating through various maps and completing objectives to reach safety. The key to survival? Teamwork, strategy, and adaptability.

The gunplay is tight and satisfying, with a wide selection of weapons including assault rifles, shotguns, SMGs, sniper rifles, and melee weapons like axes, katanas, and even frying pans! Every encounter feels dynamic, thanks to the AI Director, which adjusts the difficulty based on your team’s performance, ensuring no two playthroughs are ever the same.

Special Infected – Enemies That Keep You on Edge
Beyond the standard zombie horde, L4D2 introduces Special Infected that force players to work together:

Tank – A massive brute that can throw debris and crush survivors.
Witch – A terrifying enemy that, if startled, can instantly incapacitate a survivor.
Smoker – Uses a long tongue to drag players away from their team.
Hunter – A fast, agile infected that pounces on survivors and pins them down.
Boomer – Explodes in a shower of bile, attracting a massive horde.
Charger – Charges through groups, slamming a survivor into the ground.
Spitter – Creates pools of acid that deal heavy damage.
Each Special Infected forces different team strategies, making communication and positioning absolutely crucial.

Campaigns & Maps – A Horror Movie Experience
L4D2 features multiple campaigns, each set in diverse, apocalyptic locations across the southern U.S.:

Dead Center – A chaotic mall escape reminiscent of classic zombie films.
The Parish – A tense race across New Orleans to reach an evacuation zone.
Swamp Fever – A creepy, foggy swamp filled with infected dangers.
Hard Rain – A unique campaign featuring a devastating hurricane that changes the environment.
Dark Carnival – A fan-favorite, featuring a deadly amusement park with a thrilling rollercoaster finale.
Each campaign feels like a mini zombie movie, packed with cinematic set pieces, interactive environments, and intense finales.

Multiplayer & Game Modes – Endless Replayability
L4D2 offers several game modes that keep the action fresh:

Campaign Mode – Classic co-op survival through story-driven levels.
Versus Mode – One team plays as survivors, while the other controls the Special Infected.
Survival Mode – See how long you can last against endless waves of zombies.
Scavenge Mode – A competitive mode where teams race to collect fuel cans while being hunted.
Mutation Mode – Weekly game modifiers that add fun twists to gameplay.
Thanks to modding support and the Steam Workshop, the community has also created hundreds of custom maps, weapons, and campaigns, making L4D2’s replayability practically infinite.

Graphics & Sound – Immersive and Timeless
Even years after release, L4D2’s atmospheric lighting, detailed environments, and gruesome effects hold up well. Zombies react realistically to gunfire, and the sound design is masterful, with eerie background noises, terrifying growls from Special Infected, and intense musical cues that heighten the suspense.

The voice acting and character interactions bring the survivors to life, making them memorable and adding humor to the chaos.

Why Left 4 Dead 2 is a Must-Play
L4D2 is the perfect blend of action, horror, and co-op gameplay. Whether you’re playing with friends or AI teammates, the intense combat, unpredictable enemy encounters, and endless replayability make every match a thrilling adventure.

🔹 Final Rating: 10/10
Left 4 Dead 2 is a masterpiece of cooperative gaming. If you love zombies, action, and teamwork, this is an absolute must-play that still delivers endless fun and excitement after more than a decade.

76561197999482693,4500,S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl,22.716666666666665,"Action, RPG",0,"First, yes, you absolutely SHOULD play this game. If you're reading this here right now then that means you're obviously curious about it. I'll save you the mulling over it being old and eurojank. This game is absolutely worth your time, it is a PHENOMENAL experience and it still plays very well after all those years (even on vanilla). I bought this game because my friend recommended it to me in high school (a full decade ago lol) and it exceeded every expectation I had for it.

Now, for a warning. This has to do with the end of the game but I will try my best to explain this with little/no spoilers for anything plot related, because I really, REALLY wish I had know this before I played the game:

the last two/three levels of this game are an awful experience. They are unfairly difficult in a way that is not possible to predict and prepare for without knowing ahead of time what you are getting into. I won't go into the context of what's happening or where it is happening, but suffice to say you're fighting an ASSLOAD of enemies that can easily one shot you in a setting that will kill you just by standing in it to long. It is INSANELY EASY TO SOFTLOCK yourself into not being able to complete the game (happened to me TWICE meaning I had to redo about 8 hours of the game for BS reasons). Here's what you need to avoid that:

- you need a powerful weapon with a LOT of ammo. These enemies will gut you as soon as they turn their attention on you; the best option is to take them out BEFORE they have the opportunity to fight back. That means precision head-shots with a quality weapon (mid-tier assault rifles aint gonna cut it, I'm afraid).
- You need VERY good armor. Like I said before, the enemies hit harder than a dump truck here. If you want to stand even the most remote of chances, you need some strong armor. More importantly though you need armor (and artifacts as well) that have good stats against radiation, which brings us to the last suggestion....
- you need a metric FUCKTON of anti-rad kits and medkits. This is non-negotiable. The radiation in the final area of the game is SO ridiculously extreme that it is, by far, your biggest enemy, and by far the single biggest culprit in the game for softlocking people out of completing it. Even after killing/escaping every hostile enemy in the final area, the radiation will continue to get worse and worse and if you do NOT have the right equipment to fight it literally all the way up to the final cutscene, there is a very real risk you will soft lock yourself literally FEET AWAY FROM TRIGGERING THE END. It is BEYOND frustrating. Make sure, for god's sake, that you take the radiation threat seriously at the end of the game. Up to that point, radiation has been at worst a moderate threat in game, which luls you into a false sense of security and might make you not collect enough anti-rad artifacts and equipment throughout. This is a MASSIVE MISTAKE to make. You absolutely need them for the final area, you will NOT SURVIVE if you do not prepare for this. 

There, that's all you need to know to keep yourself from soft-locking yourself out of the end of the game. So long as you heed my advice and keep these points in mind for the end of the game, you should be golden. It's such a shame that the game ends on such a bullshit and unfair note like that, because evreything leading up to it is truly remarkable. But nevertheless, even with the terrible last few hours of the game, the vast majority of the game is incredible and definitely worth your time. Pick it up whenever you can, and good hunting, Stalker. | Thanks to its story and setting, I really got drawn into the game. After completing it I couldn't wait but go to play the next parts. I finished the whole game two times and would do that again as Shadow of Chernobyl is still playabe even in 2025.

The class system is amazing, allowing you to combine two out of nine mastery trees to make your own unique class with an incredible amount of customization.  You have the fully offensive, close-quarter mastery Warfare, which revolves around duel weidling weapons and becoming a whirlwind of AoE and single target damage, at the cost of defence. Ranged masteries like Hunting which allows you to deal huge amounts of damage from a distance, and debuff your enemies defences. Magic masteries such as Spirit, which allows you to drain the life from your enemies! And 6 other unique and exiting masteries.

The world is vibrant and beautiful, starting in Greece, them moving to Egypt, then China, and with the DLC, even into the domain of Hades himself!

Not to mention the amazing loot you will find along your journey.

友情提示:
1.游戏购买的话强烈建议买Titan Quest Gold这个大包,商店地址:
http://store.steampowered.com/sub/402/
包含了泰坦之旅原版及其资料片不朽王座(相比原版增加了第九种专精梦幻之境,超大的第五幕冥界地图及对应的剧情,新增神器栏位及大量装备等等)
2.黄金版默认优先级最高的语言是德语,如果客户端使用简体中文或者繁体中文的话,将游戏语言改成英文或者将客户端语言切成英语
3.推荐资料:泰坦百科JOYGAO,在百度泰坦之旅吧右侧的公共网盘有下载,有地图/技能/装备说明等资料,帮助上手

因为不朽王座需要在原版的基础上运行,所以将原版的测评加到这里避免发两个内容类似的测评,下面是正式内容:
泰坦之旅是一款个人认为非常优秀的ARPG,拥有广阔的地图，史诗般的冒险旅程，细致的场景，独特的音乐，以及丰富的搭配。
1.游戏世界及场景:游戏世界包括了五个章节地图,(I)希腊(II)埃及(III)东方(IV)奥林匹斯山(V)冥界。前三章节基本取材于现实世界,以欧洲的地中海地区+非洲与亚洲为基础构建,有很多著名的场景例如雅典城、斯芬克斯像、空中花园、长城、长安城等等，而后两章则是以神话背景为主,(IV)奥林匹斯山作为原版的BOSS战地图只有一个场景,(V)冥界则是资料片新增内容,比之前的章节地图都要大且复杂一些,同时难度也远比之前要高。场景有缺点但更多的是优点:因为对于火焰和闪电特效的优化不足，部分场景存在着卡顿的问题（主要在第三章和第五章后面的少数场景）,不过还好大多数情况是流畅的并且有补丁可以一定程度改善。值得一提的是即使很多地方玩家不一定注意到，制作组还是将游戏的场景细节处理的非常不错,例如各个场景中摆放的工艺品及壁画装饰等等.
2.剧情:泰坦之旅的主线剧情和很多奇幻风格的游戏一样是一路成长斩妖除魔,看似平淡却不平凡.主角最开始只是名普通的冒险者,随着冒险的展开,击败了一个个强大的敌人，人们眼中可怕无比的怪物甚至高不可攀的神最终也被击败,游戏的名字Titan Quest我觉得起的非常不错，主角完成了他自己的泰坦之旅,最终成为一名被人歌颂事迹的英雄,玩家也目睹这一切,其中的艰辛与成就感相信可以在游戏过程中慢慢体会出。主线剧情有三个难度，普通、史诗与传奇，想要完全通关一个角色必须先后通关这三个难度。支线部分则轻松许多,多是帮助路过的城镇的局民解决一些问题或者是探索一些地方的宝藏,奖励也很丰厚可以多做一些.
3.人物/怪物:制作组将很多历史与神话故事里面的人物加入到游戏当中作为npc,其中一些还设计了与之相关的任务.可惜的是很多人物只是借用了一个名字且只有一些人物设计了单独的模型。而相比之下怪物种类设计就多样并且很多有鲜明的地域性,例如米诺斯迷宫中的公牛怪,尼罗河附近手持矛或法杖的鳄鱼怪,长安城皇宫中的兵马俑.
4.音乐及音效:泰坦之旅的音效相对来说中规中矩，我感觉不错的包括一些被动技能触发、锤类武器打击怪物时的音效，剩下的就先不说了。主要说下音乐。游戏针对不同场景设计了与场景十分搭配的音乐,例如山洞/迷宫/雪山,不同章节（希腊/埃及/东方/冥界）的背景音乐也有着明显的风格差异,我觉得比较好听且说得上名字的音乐是初期在希腊的When God Falls(游戏中更轻柔些且没有歌词)([url=http://www.xiami.com/song/1770541533]试听[/url])与后期领主那里的Rock Of Mages([url=http://yun.baidu.com/s/1dDfmVBF]试听[/url])。BOSS战的时候也跟据章节及BOSS种类设计了多种背景音乐,营造出一种紧张的氛围。
5.技能与装备:游戏共有九个专精,包括偏战系的战斗/防御/狩猎专精,偏法系的风暴/大地/死灵专精与偏辅助的梦幻/自然/盗贼专精。人物总共可以选择两个专精(分别在2级与8级),专精选择好后即有独特职业名(共36种双专精职业与9种单专精职业)。技能方面采用了专精条+技能树的设计,升级与任务获得的技能点数将用于专精点数及技能点数上,如果想要学习一个技能就必须学会其技能数的基础技能(如果有的话)并达到相应的专精条高度,这就需要玩家在属性(专精条加成)与技能威力(技能等级)之间进行权衡,保证尽量在整个游戏过程中有足够的输出及安全性。!!不过要注意的是!!，因为有了专精条占用了大量的技能点数，前期的输出技能可能比较单调甚至没有以甚至只有武器普通攻击,可能会带来较少的乐趣.游戏的装备非常多样,配合技能有非常多搭配。怪物的技能也非常多样性，包括技能的特效，伤害类型都进行了设计，造就出了很多杀手级的怪物，一不注意就有可能被这些拥有强力技能的怪物杀死返回重生泉，BOSS的技能相当强力，在传奇难度下有的BOSS甚至有将角色满血秒杀的能力。从寻宝游戏的角度来看,泰坦之旅的装备比较多样性,独特装备较多,且掉落几率相对较高(百分之几至千分之几的居多),而且多亏了游戏""怪物装备什么掉落什么""的设定,可以通过和周围同种怪物的外观区别来迅速识别出想要的装备,寻宝的效率大大提高,同时又有一些珍惜的词缀与装备底材搭配,出现了一些""浮云装备""来供寻宝者们挑战收集.是一款非常不错的寻宝类型的游戏.
6.MOD:优秀的MOD可以延续游戏的生命,为游戏注入新的活力,泰坦之旅的MOD方面做的还算不错,个人推荐一个很不错的MOD叫SoulVizier,这个MOD在原来游戏的基础上增加了大量的新装备与部分技能,平衡了一些专精,因为装备与人物技能的思路与之前并无太大差异,所以在对于游戏有了一定的基础后可以尝试这个MOD.

强烈推荐

十周年版
http://store.steampowered.com/app/475150 | Titan Quest, and its worthy expansion Immortal Throne is, imo, part of the holy trinity in ARPG's along side Diablo and Dungeon Siege. Titan Quests theme is unique, and the gameplay is so faithful to the principles that made diablo so great.
There is a massive, diverse world covered in several acts. In combination with tons of loot in the suspected qualities to keep the flow of the game intact. On top of that, the game also follows the model of increased difficulty (normal, epic, legendary), remeniscent of Diablo's normal, nightmare and hell. Each difficulty features harder monsters and better loot.

If at one point, you would get tired of the original campaign, you can try some of the fantastic mods available, especially Lilith: Battle for Jalavin (a totally newly created world which will take you up to 20 hours to complete). This mod in combination with other well known TQ mods such as Masteries mod (skill overhaul mod), gives more than enough incentive to go through the whole experience all over again with a fresh new slate.

All in all, if you are a fan of ARPG's it is a genuine crime not to have this masterpiece. The majority of the now-closed TQ studio (Iron Lore) are in the process of making a spiritual succesor named Grim Dawn (by Crate Entertainement). Given their history with TQ, this is a title to keep in mind as well and currently available through early acces on steam.

Closing advice: go spend money on this, preferably as soon as possible, you will not regret it. | Пожалуй одна из лучших Hack'n'Slash RPG. Которая может сравниться с мастодонтом жанра Diablo и даже в чём-то её обыграть. Например :
* Большой простор для создания собственного класса. Воин-Маг, Лучник-Убийца, Маг со щитом - пожалуйста, создавайте и отыгрывайте свой класс. Сколько я много в эту игру играл, а все комбинации так и не испробовал. 
* Мир более проработан, локации не представляют собой рандомно созданные пещеры или леса, а созданные вручную места, так, что бродить по ним не приедается даже после n-ого по счёту прохождения.
* Удачная адаптация Древнегреческих, Египетских и Китайских мифов в которых мы принимаем непосредственное участие. Раньше до того как не опробовал игру, я и не мог себе представить, что Hack'n'Slash + Мифы Древней Греции могут быть чем-то толковым, но я ошибался.
* Титаническое количество лута, как обычного так и уникального (у которого существует несколько градаций), причем на первой сложности все предметы вы не сможете найти, с новой сложностью становятся доступными для нахождения новые более мощные предметы. 

Короче говоря мне не стыдно поставить в один ряд такие две игры как Titan Quest и Diablo так, как каждая из них обладает своими неоспоримыми достоинствами. | Titan Quest is almost ten years old, but it's still one the best action RPGs out there.  

Pros:
Great skill system offers a TON of replayability
Good in-game mythos based on real life mythology
Excellent variety of enemies to fight
Well-balanced loot drops (not too much, not too little)
Some uber-bosses only in appear in harder difficulties giving you incentive to play through again

Cons:
No map randomization
No instanced loot in multiplayer
Game stutters once in a while even on modern computers

The graphics, while from an earlier era, have aged remarkably well. The detailed unit designs and atmospheric battlefields still capture the gritty, war-torn essence of the 40k universe, immersing players in the chaos of the far future.

The game’s story and factions stay true to the Warhammer 40k lore, delivering a narrative that resonates deeply with fans. Each faction feels authentic, from the relentless march of the Necrons to the righteous fury of the Sisters of Battle, ensuring that the gameplay aligns perfectly with the dark, gothic atmosphere of the universe.

Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Soulstorm is its vibrant modding community. Over the years, dedicated fans have kept the game alive and thriving, introducing new factions, campaigns, and quality-of-life improvements. Mods like the Ultimate Apocalypse and Unification expansions breathe new life into the game, offering a fresh experience even for long-time players.

For fans of 40k and strategy games, Dawn of War: Soulstorm remains an essential classic, as compelling today as it was at launch. | The greatest warhammer RTS game of all time

76561197999482693,9460,Frontlines™: Fuel of War™,0.0,Action,0,"At first, when looking at the steam page and reading the game contents, I expected a rather different product, something that would be similar to ""Planetside 2"", a type of game that has the global war aesthetics. Although the game turned out completely different to my imagination, its a decent shooter that involves a wide diversity in equipment, allowing the gameplay to be more dynamic.

I'd say its ""Call of Duty"" with ""Battlefield"" inspirations, as the addition of vehicles are awesome, making the game stand out. The gameplay actually feels great as it delivers the total war aspect, with shooting, fighting and vehicle combat all around the player, especially when rockets whizz over the head, exploding somewhere in the background or under your feet. These characteristics portray the authentic feel, which involves the player into the fight, especially when you drive off the enemy forces and take the objectives one by one, feeling less resistance with each step. While the story was not anything spectacular, I was more interested in the missions, as various battle scenarios, where the NPCs are surprisingly well set, as they do not always target you no matter what (as in other shooter games), but also pay attention to other threats, such as your teammates and friendly vehicles.

Now, the game lacks, in my opinion, in gunplay, because the weapons seem very inaccurate with high spray. Assuming that the assault rifle is your most used weapon in almost all the missions, shooting it felt very unsatisfying, as it would already lose its efficiency already in mid range (especially if you're trying to shoot the enemy's unguarded body parts, whose behind the cover). Speaking of enemies, they are fairly buffed (or perhaps the weapons' damage is low), as you need to decently spray the enemies with bullets in order to kill them. I found the MG (also the sniper rifle) to be the most efficient, as it two-shots everyone and can easily tear up sentries, but unfortunately its available only by the end of the game. The legendary red barrels that explode upon shooting, are also lacking in their function, as explosion damage seems to have a very small area of impact, which is the same with any explosive-related weaponry.

Nevertheless, I liked the game, despite it not meeting my expectations (my expectations, my problems XD) and having troubles in key areas, the overall gameplay feel is there and I can definitely recommend to try the game, if you like shooters."

There was supposed to be a patch made by former community manager IdolNinja, who sadly passed away from cancer. Despite many promises to him personally that the patch would be completed, it was never completed, Volition closed down, and now, the game is just as unstable and broken as in 2009. 

Gearbox should be ashamed for continuing to sell this, for all of the problems the ports of the later games have, they are actually playable. This game genuinely crashes so often it stretches the meaning of ""playable"", and just to make it stable, you need multiple separate fan patches.

One of which is made by IdolNinja too, from before he was even hired by Volition. The fact that they didn't even bother to integrate his bugfix mod into the game's download is an actual insult to his memory. Somehow, this version of the game manages to be a ""fuck you"" to the legacy of someone who was by all accounts a decent guy.

Do not buy this. the 360 version in Xenia is a better experience. The KBM controls in this version suck anyways, it's not exactly a downgrade to play compared to this port. And you can actually play the DLC mission packs.

Gameplay, gunplay, controls, saving, sound effects, voice acting, and enemy AI are all good.
Graphics and story-line/setting are average, but visual aesthetics have aged pretty well. No major technical issues or game-breaking bugs, just a few environmental hit-boxes being larger than their model suggests.

I quit this game twice: once when it was new and once when it was outdated (2025) with little-to-no nostalgia. It stops being fun a few hours in, and I didn't even get to the part that most negative reviews described as the bad part/half of the game.

First few hours were fun though, before grinding to a halt about halfway through the story (2 hours in, assuming the later chapters are about the same length as the earlier chapters). You get vague instructions for a set of 5 objectives in close proximity to one another. Used up most of my resources with multiple reloaded saves because it wasn't clear what objective I had missed and/or how I was supposed to complete one or more objectives. No pun intended: this section and lack of clear direction/instructions destroyed my immersion/engagement with the story/setting and lead me to use (the small number of) console commands to tackle the key marketed feature of the game.

I began limit testing the permanent environmental destruction.
It was a very interesting and new technological innovation for Red Faction's release, but it's just disappointing decades later. It is rarely used for engaging exploration or clever ways to solve (or get around) puzzles. Many of the materials are indestructible, including the rock ""wall"" at the edges (including the top) of a level's environment: I think each level is a large cube of rock/stone with the level ""dug out"" by the level designers and then stuff like walls/floors/ceilings/pipes/buildings/furniture/NPCs are placed within the dug out spaces.

I digress. The game simply isn't designed to let you use its featured, brand-spanking-new mechanic in interesting ways. There are clear markers/signs (visual or vocally described by a VA) that you are supposed to explore somewhere or open a new pathway by blowing up a very specific part of the environment, and are really wasting your time trying  explosives on any unmarked places, even with ammo cheats enabled. | Je suis vraiment énervé. Enervé parce que ce jeu m'a fait miroiter un FPS beaucoup plus intéressant qu'il ne l'est réellement. J'ai passé toute la campagne à le supplier de mieux utiliser son potentiel. 


Le Geo-Mod qui a fait la fierté du jeu ? Plutôt bien exploité dans les premières maps, puis anecdotique et quasiment pas gratifiant par la suite
Le système d'escalade de certaines surfaces ? Présent à un seul moment alors que ça aurait pu vraiment donner des niveaux uniques.
Un arsenal varié ? Pas vraiment d'intérêt à l'expérimenter, et en plus on vous le remet à zéro plusieurs fois.
Des phases d'infiltration pour amener de la variété ? Ridicules et pas du tout fun.
Un scénario aux bases intéressantes ? Dommage, vous aurez une histoire de révolution finalement assez solitaire. Niveau personnages, vous avez le méchant le plus cliché possible, des alliés qui vous gueuleront des ordres de manières particulièrement insupportables et des PNJ qui ne servent quasiment qu'à vous bloquer le chemin.


Red Faction est également un jeu buggé, même si vous avez le fanpatch qui a pignon sur rue. J'ai été ainsi softlock plusieurs fois au point de relancer des maps via la console du jeu.


La cerise sur le gâteau, c'est le dernier tiers du jeu que je trouve raté, entre :


-  l'arrivée d'un certain type d'ennemi qui s'avère posséder une puissance de feu absurdement élevée (dans un jeu qui, jusque là, n'était clairement pas exigeant pour un FPS de cette époque) . A vous la joie des fameuses sauvegardes de la mort, celles qui nous voient à l'article de la mort juste avant d'affronter des mobs puissants qui respawnent à l'infini !
-le level design qui vous laisse en plan avec des objectifs flous et du backtracking
-un manque de pêche général
-des bugs !

Je salue quand même l'efficacité du jeu en tant que FPS défouloir solo, les phases en véhicules réussies quoique courtes et une belle variété dans les environnements.


Cela dit, Red Faction a très clairement loupé son rendez-vous avec l'histoire du FPS des années 2000.

Cutscenes are supposed to be action-packed and dramatic but are lame instead. The first one shows an enemy repeatedly shooting into a wall trying to hit the our squad/plane on the other side, followed by us landing and our squad and theirs dying one-by-one with no shots fired or melee taking place until the player is the last one standing.

Non-sensical situations/in-universe logic. Guard towers are built on top of highly explosive, unprotected generators? Enemies repeatedly destroy their own walls/buildings with RPGs in order to get LoS on the player? I'm going to go play something else. | Got softlocked in the 2nd level (can't get through a door). I am therefore uninstalling this game and never playing again.

Anyway. Other than that, the game is not as bad as I thought it was gonna be, but it's not much fun either.

The first thing I noticed about this game is how simple and fast-paced it is. It's accessible, but not necessarily particularly interesting either. The main problems for me are the following :

1- The main thing I like about the game is using explosives like the grenade launcher. However, I killed myself multiple times when using it (or regular grenades). That ruined my fun.

2- What ruined my fun even more is how punishing it is to die. What I mean by that is that you will most likely have to put up with unskippable cutscenes if you die and you'll have to redo the same segments multiple times. It is painful.

These issues would have been easy to fix. Not that the game had that much potential, but it still would have been better if the most obvious flaws had been improved before the release of the game. | Pokračovačka rubání a ničení. Zapni to a fárej."

On that note, I have mixed feelings about the new campaign. The difficulty curve is rather steep and the new corruption mechanic is kind of pointless because you have to pretty much skip content in order to gain corruption. Either that or purposely equip increasingly cursed items like an idiot.
On the flip side I like the new psyker unit and the new weapons are welcome additions. I even went out of my way to rotate characters around to try the new gear.
Besides that the game is rather janky these days, especially the sound, so I encountered more technical problems that I care to mention. The highlight of the issues was probably bosses pushing Cyrus outside of the level geometry.
Anyway, that's all I have to say since this is an expansion and not a new game.

Out of all the game this one caused me the least technical issues and it's also the most complete in terms of content so Retribution is the best for playing skirmishes.
Besides that the campaign makes a return with a new party of heroes, this time based off the commander units from the skirmish mode, and the conclusion to the story that started in the first Dawn of War with some pretty cool cutscenes. 
But I saved the best for last: the campaign can be played with all 6 races. They vary in quality but they are all rich on hammy voice acting.
The only issue is that the campaign is always the same with slightly different dialogue. Some elements from skirmish mode are present such as building units but the levels are fairly linear so there's little space for the dynamic battles from actual skirmishes. Also, one of your heroes is always silent and that blows.
In conclusion, I think Retribution is pretty good. It's sad that it never reached the level of polish that Company of Heroes has but Warhammer is obviously more niche than World War 2 so that's understandable."

[td]No. Despite some good points, Titan Quest is, ultimately, a mind-numbing slog. It doesn’t do anything that countless other ARPGs have done before or after its time, and has no specific features or qualities that set its own identity.[/td]

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Writing & Worldbuilding[/h3]
Titan Quest’s ancient Fantasy setting, spanning from Greece to African regions and even higher planes of existence such as Hades (Hell) and Elysium (Heaven), is overall detailed, consistent and well-made visually and artistically. Despite its age, the visuals hold up well enough, and the ragdoll physics add some dynamicity to an otherwise very static combat feel. If you enjoy historical settings, you’ll feel right at home. 

Given that deep, meaningful plots are never a priority in this genre, efforts have been made in other iconic titles to, at least, grant a semblance of interest to the various tasks at hand, take Diablo II for example. That doesn’t happen in Titan Quest, however. Whereas the main story is generic but serviceable, any and all side characters or quests are inconsequential—their middle school grade writing only worsens the dullness of tasks already repetitive by nature. You’ll find no interest whatsoever in any of the admittedly iconic characters you’ll meet, such as great ancient heroes and even demigods, all stripped of any pathos or epicness they may have had.

[h3]Exploration & Secrets[/h3]
You’ll explore each area on foot, your only means of transport besides two-way portals that allow fast-travel to discovered locations, such as cities, to sell loot, use facilities and restock consumables—the standard ARPG fare. Notably, quest givers aren’t highlighted when it’s time to return a completed quest, so good luck remembering where “Generic NPC I Forgot The Name Of’’ is located. The average speed of your character is inadequate to traverse any area in a decent time; with how large each map is, you’ll find yourself walking more than fighting, since enemy density is subpar. You’ll often ask yourself when the current area will end, because you’re fed up with it already.

Each map has plenty of side-areas and dungeons that often host Elite or Boss enemies guarding higher-tier chests that have a chance to spawn the best loot. Exploring is worthwhile to mop up as much XP as you can, but not so much for loot since most chests, including “secret” ones, have miserable rewards. The satisfaction of finding a secret dungeon, clearing it and getting some actual good loot from it is almost always absent.

[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]
The combat gameplay, of course, will change based on your Masteries (classes) of choice, ranging from pure casters to summoners, melee specialists, archers, rogues, and why not, a mix of all the above. The amount of combinations is staggering, with a relatively cheap respec option available at any town for skills. The standard ARPG system of mana, health and related potions is in place, plus an array of consumable Scrolls that have a variety of unique effects, purchased for a high price or rarely found. Should you perish in combat, a feat not easy to achieve due to the generally tame challenge posed by your foes, an XP penalty is applied, having you return to your death-mark to reclaim it; nothing else is lost.

The cooldowns. Good lord the cooldowns. Of any ARPG I have played, Titan Quest takes the cake for the slowest, most infuriating cooldown timers. Whoever thought a 30 seconds cooldown on the basic Taunt skill for a tank (which doesn’t work properly half the time anyway) or even 60 second ones on caster skills were good ideas, should take a break from game development and play some Diablo II to see how it’s done.

Even if the enemy variety is good in a general sense, most maps overextend and bloat for too long, having you fight countless of the same fodder far past what would be ideal for this genre. The Elite and Boss enemies aren’t unique or meaningful enough to grant the needed diversity. Speaking of higher-tier enemies, unless you go against one that is twenty levels above you, you won’t have much problems dealing with them, at least on the default difficulty setting. Most of them are miserable, generic, and just don’t stand out enough from the crowd save for some different color or aura around them. I died a total of five times in the whole game, which isn’t a lot. 

[h3]Character Progression[/h3]
By killing enemies and completing quests, you’ll level up and receive 3 Skill and 2 Attribute points each time. You can also get these as quest rewards, alongside other unique bonuses like +% damage, but that’s a rare occurrence. 

You’ll also loot charms from enemies and chests, which can be used on weapons to bestow passive traits that compound your build, and also reused by destroying the weapon to get the charm back and then put it on a better one.

Leveling up in Titan Quest is tremendously slow: by the end of the campaign, after doing everything, I was just level 37; the level cap is 75. That’s less than one level per hour, which may be fine for the last 10-20 levels in an ARPG, when your build is already shaped up, but it’s a depressing affair so early. Your gameplay evolves slowly, frustratingly so: your combat experience will stay the same for hours on end if you decide to focus on a few skills, which is the only way to make them worth using to begin with. Also, you’ll also have to spend skill points to increase your Mastery level and access higher tier skills, further sinking more points into passive stats instead of active skills that evolve your class’ gameplay. | I fully recommend this game. Read on if you want to know why.

The pros:
Although this game was released in 2006 the graphics are still holding up with nowadays games.
But not only the graphics are great even the artstyle is an outstandig masterpiece.
It's not too dark or too colorful.
The game is set in pre-roman ironage mixed up with mythologie.
It's a really well fitiing and unspent setting.
The character progression and skilling is interesting.
The sound ambient and music is well made and catching.
The developer delivered all of the tools the games have been made with, so you can make your own Titan Quest mod or total conversion.

The cons:
The controls feel a bit clumpy. You often get stuck on small clutter on the ground you're barely seeing.
The game doesn't recognize when you're pressing multiple buttons at once for activating skills for example.
This can be the reason why you die rather quickly and thats frustrating.
Sometimes the frames drop at a low rate when special effects like rain or snow are showing.
Even though you can expand your bag the room to hoard stuff is very limited. You need to use third-party-tools like TQVault to expand you stash.
This also applies to the attributes like strength, dexterity, intelligence etc. You need to use third-party-tools to reset them.
The devs have added some lategame contenct but it's not enough to keep the players busy imo.

All in all it's a great game that you should play. | [h1]Один из лучших дьяблоидов[/h1]
Игровой процесс заключается в том, что мы уничтожаем монстров, собираем выпавшие вещи и продвигаемся дальше. Поднимая вещи лучшего качества, или повышая уровень, мы можем в тот же момент ощутить превосходство над обитателями. Да и самих обитателей огромное множество видов из разных мифологий. Хоть это и звучит банально, игра сильно увлекательна.

Ключевой особенностью игры является то, что мы не выбираем класс персонажа вначале, а формируем его сами, выбирая две школы, что даёт огромное число вариантов развития. К тому же каждая школа подразумевает несколько стилей игры. Гениальная система позволяет собрать персонажа под себя.

Локации красивые и разнообразны. Греческие поля, Египетские пустыни, Гималайские горы, Китайские джунгли, Небесные чертоги и владения Аида. Все они созданы вручную и приятны для исследования.

По поводу сюжета сказать ничего не могу, т.к. играл с друзьями и они так быстро брутфорсили игру, что не то что диалоги почитать, описания предметов читать не успевал. Возможно, познакомлюсь с историей в другой раз. 

А вот багов (которые, как говорят, присутствуют в основном при игре по сети) в игре больше, чем хотелось бы. Пропадания текста, неработающие порталы, подвисания, пропадающие квестовые предметы. В среднем за сессию приходилось раза 3 пересоздавать.

Рекомендую, особенно в кампании друзей! | Un jeu d'une intensité et d'une durée de vie exceptionnelle pour petits et grands! | Bu tarz oyunlardan Baldur's Gate 1, Dungeon Siege 1 ve 2' yi oynadım.

Çantadaki fazla eşyaları kolaylıkla  teleport oluşturup bir mekana ışınlanarak satıp, savaş alanına geri dönebiliyorsun. Heme de sınırsız. Yok ışınlanma parşömeni gerekiyor, o parjömene de bir dünya para vereceksin falan öyle bir dert yok. Oyunu daha bitirmedim. Zorluk seviyesi de seçmedim. Varsa da nasıl seçiliyor henüz bilmiyorum. Belki zorluk seviyesinden dolayı böyledir. Fakat yine de beni başlangıç olarak diğer oyunlara göre fazla yormadı. Kesinlikle tavsiye edeceğim bir oyun."
76561197999482693,667720,Red Faction Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered,0.0,,0,"Aw man, this is probably one of the best games from the 7th console generation. This is THE example of gameplay over narrative.

Would it be better with a good story? Sure, maybe... But does a game with destruction mechanics that are still highly intricate and advanced 15+ years later really need to have a deep story? Mindlessly smash and explode your problems away until you bring down the entire political system of Mars.

You're the good guy in this, trust me :3 | Essa versão é o remaster do jogo de 2009 que ficou um pouco melhor que o original.
Se vc tem problema de jogar o o jogo em inglês, existe uma tradução de PT-BR do pessoal tribo gamer, mas não testei essa tradução pra ver se tem alguma divergência com o jogo 

Vc controla um minerador que junta com a rebelião contra a opressão (edf) por um motivo (só isso kkk).

Pontos positivos: O jogo é de mundo aberto e se destaca com as destruições de cenários, dá pra destruir praticamente todas as estruturas. O legal é pegar uma bazuca e fazer estragos nos prédios kkk.
Fica mais legal quando a rebelião se junta durante o tiroteio.
Não tive problema na otimização.

Pontos negativos: a história é genérica, missões secundárias ficam legais no começo e mais tarde fica cansativo, inteligência artificial dos aliados que ficam saindo do carro quando estão de carona com vc e inimigos.

OBS: Existe um modo que vc joga com SAM como se fosse dlc mas é do próprio jogo.

O jogo vale a pena pegar na promoção pra se divertir, parece que os jogos antigos estão muitos bem trabalhados e completos do que os jogos atuais, dá pra ver que foi feito com carinho cada detalhes das estruturas, veículos, roupas do jogo.

Terminei o jogo com 15 horas de duração. | So first off, not the worst but not the best. It IS definitely a classic worth owning, that being said It is a classic with the problems of it's time. So if your new to the game remember that. There IS story but not really the focus, the focus of the game was it's destruction system, If you played Just Cause 2 and up it's basically that story wise and game-play wise except on mars and no flight ability. I like the game as a not so serious Legal weed edible on and off game. I play it to blow stuff up in creative ways and not think too much about anything else. If you play on above normal thou be prepared to kill many people as the enemy may and will drown you in themselves and watch ammo. Try and not to be too sympathetic about allies dying as they are as dumb as they can be and show up often without request and are at best expendable distraction, they can also make things worse if your trying to be selective in your destruction. The best way to save them is to not see them die and lose your alert level.

The game for what it is....Is simple. What you do in the game you will be doing till the end of it with enough upgrades and story to get you to it's end. A classic with flaws to be sure but in terms of entertainment it's sure to be better than nothing and worth a grab on sale or full price. The game after this one is not worth buying. | Grab the hammer and start looking at buildings in a different way. Time to de-stress after a long day.

Red Faction Guerrila was a simple game with a simple story but a enjoyable one with a couple of things that could have some better design choices. Right from the the start you know what to expect in the game. You know what areas there is to explore and what to do to restore them to what they were before thing gone bad. The EDF is here and they are not welcome, the barricades, the defenses, the turrents, all most be gone and lucky for you, you will have a great arsenal to make things easier. There are 6 areas for you to focus in the main story and plenty of side activities to keep you busy but not enough for you to get burn out doing them all. I finished around 30 activities and after that I felt I've seen everything there was to see and the remaining would be more copy and paste without anything new so I stopped doing them and went back to the main story.  

Performance wise I only got a crash to the desktop and it was during the DLC main mission. Aside of that, when exiting the game I got a black screen a couple of times, nothing serious. Pushing the FOV to the max makes the game feels so much better, I highly recommend it. Gameplay wise it's a solid game but could have better mechanics. The cars feel a little too stiff when cornering and wobbly on the desert segments. Guns are more than enough and it does not get old destrying everything. Be cautious of how you use them because the AI allies tend to be a little too close for you and sometimes when swinging the hammer the worst can happen. It wouldn't be too bad if you didn't get a morale penalty when your allies die. Speaking of dying, you also get lower morale when you die so if you are dying too much just drop the difficulty down and you'll be good to go. The music feels good and gave me some Mad Max vibes. The world does not offer much variety and cut-scenes could be better looking but it's normal considering the initial release of the game.
 
12 hours after, I finished the main game with some side activities. The DLC is well worth your time and it's a quick one with around 2 more hours from start to finish. I got all the activities and main missions as well destroying everything in the DLC in two gaming sessions. | -геймдизайн. выглядит как говно и играется так же.

76561197999482693,41900,The Bard's Tale ARPG: Remastered and Resnarkled,0.0,"Action, Adventure, RPG",0,"Divertido y gamberro, cargado de humor negro y sátira, es el primer juego que toco de esta franquicia que tengo entendido viene desde la prehistoria (bueno no tanto, de los 80 ^^) ... entiendo que es un remaster de un trabajo del 2005 y se nota, las mecánicas, la interfaz y muchos aspectos técnicos son bastante toscos y simples (para los cánones actuales), pero en lo personal no me desagradó, me pareció novedoso .... esos puntos de guardado, me produjeron nostalgia.

Es la aventura épica, la gran odisea de un valeroso bardo en busca de ... PONERLA, sí, y con la más rankeada del barrio ^^ | Fantastic game, a truly hidden gem. Voice acting, jokes and songs are the highlight, but the gameplay itself is really solid too. Its still smooth and responsive and gives a lot of fun. | This game has aged very poorly so keep that in mind if you plan to play it. 

First the good. The story, world, and characters are still really good, some of the humor may not stand the test of time for some folks but overall, I found the humor to landed more the missed. The bard as a character is also a huge POS so if you like playing more traditional heroes you might not like him as much, though Karma almost always hits back at the bard in all his encounters.

Then the bad, sorry to say the worst part of the Bard's Tale is the gameplay though. This is one of the worse controlled action RPGs I've really played and least variety in terms of combat. 

First every map has you fight the same two to three enemy types over and over. Their models may change but their tactics largely don't with typically One ranged type and one melee type and rarely a healing enemy. Melee only goal is to surround you and they can stun lock you very easy if they succeed, ranged enemies barely matter, and healing are annoying as they constantly run away. You fight so many of these groups over and over with increasing numbers to the point you'd have to cheese them from afar as you can attack them off screen with a bow and they'll do nothing.

Second your combat capabilities are very limited. You have a melee attack that is almost always blocked if you attack from the front against any melee enemy. A ranged weapon that takes so long to fire that if enemies are charging at you and get maybe one to two shots before they reach you if you don't attack while they are off screen in which case congrats you found the strategy to slowly and boringly win every fight. Summons who are either too weak to be helpful getting off one-two attacks maybe before immediately dying, are too utility based to do anything meaningful, or simply don't work as advertised 70% of the time. Grab the tank minion only for enemies to still prioritize you, grab the mercenary to attack only to suffer the same fate as the player when swarmed by melee enemies and immediately dying, grab the summon to remove traps only for him to stupidly run towards enemies and die, etc. and etc.

If you do want to try this just play on the easiest setting for the story because I can pretty much guarantee the combat and gameplay aspects of this title will wear down any played who was just mildly interested in a new RPG. | A mostly competent early ARPG. Fun enough, despite some rough patches, and while it does show its age when it comes to the menus and options, even as a remastered version, it still holds up well enough to play.  The voice work is good, the songs are decent, but there is a strange lack of music overall. | I really tried, but lack of QoL plus the camera height made it too difficult, I'm afraid.
Sucks because it seems like a really funny Cary Elwes role."

a fun but limited deathmatch game that has no one playing online

the bots you play against are way too easy and they cheat like crazy. unlimited boost, they tailgate you forever while airbraking. they dont stall but you do.
 they are way too easy, very repetitive and only become dangerous in groups 
(even on the hardest setting)

it could use better controller support, 
allthough it works well enough using one.
the way they work make menu choices slow and tedious.
instead of jumping through the options,
a controller gives you a slow moving arrow as you use a mouse. 
ingame they work well enough

the multiplayer part is dead, no one online

i give it a 6/10 overall.

it's ok for some mindless fun | Este es uno de esos juegos que te hacen dudar a la hora de puntuarlos. No es gran cosa, pero luego miras el precio que tiene, lo comparas con la mayoría de juegos que hay en Steam y, ¡oye!, ¿por qué no?

Por poco menos de 3 euros (aún menos si estamos en verano o navidad) es un juego que te hará pasar unas cuantas horas de diversión con una buena jugabilidad y una IA respetable. Desde mi punto de vista, que un juego multijugador disponga de una IA para jugar tú solo contra ella es un punto a destacar. Muchos juegos multijugador hoy en día ignoran la frustración de los jugadores que no tienen una conexión a Internet lo suficientemente buena como para poder competir con otros jugadores en igualdad de condiciones.

Basically, you love the genre you have the following options:

1. King's Bounty 
2. HOMM 3 or HOMM 3 + Horn of the Abyss
3. HOMM 5 (never played but it seems good)
4. New Song of Conquest (bought, but haven't played yet)

Age of Wonders and other 4X don't fit, so they cannot be really considered. 
Also, a viable option is Spellforce but it has RTS elements.
Or some more 'tactic' games where you have arena after arena but it's totally different stuff.

What I absolutely love about the game:
1. Old KB (HOMM) formula: mix of basic RPG elements with a turn-based strategy game
2. Fairy, fantasy, hand-crafted visual
3. Casual, silly humor and in some way deconstruction of the fantasy genre
4. Engaging combat with a huge variety of units and fun bosses
5. Absolutely gorgeous music that goes in a row for me with another Katauri masterpiece > Space Rangers!
6. A mix of graphics, design and music creates a vivid fairy tail atmosphere and a cozy feeling deep inside my soul :)
7. Spirit of adventure, princesses, dragons and pirates!
8. Strong nostalgic feeling. For me personally :P

I played it more than 5 times for sure and after all these years, yeah, the graphic looks a bit poor and bleak, but only for the first few hours. After that, it's hard to leave this world of magic and epic battles!

Definitely recommend it to anyone who likes the genre and who just likes slow-paced gameplay with nice visuals and pleasant music. You won't be disappointed! | 如果要在居家隔离一年，只允许带一个游戏，那我肯定选这个 | Незрозуміло хто власник компанії. Є підозра на спонсорування і підтримки рф, тобто - терористами! | 還不錯"

 | Amazing game and out right fun with friends regardless of what happens. Why don't I recommend the game? I am unable to even launch the game anymore and have tried hundreds of hours to try fixing it. It's unplayable and the support I've reached out to either ignores me or says it's steam's issue for the game not working and steam won't take any form of help when requests are made to them.

76561197999482693,43000,Front Mission Evolved,2.533333333333333,Action,5,"It's a painful 7th gen console game and you can feel it throughout the entire game.

The gameplay has you battling against a number of different types of mechs or wanzers as they're called in the game, where you can destroy parts of their armor to reduce the effectiveness of the limb
for example, destroying the legs, makes the wanzer unable to move effectively, or shooting the arms will make the guns less accurate. 
Which also counts for you, so you have a goal of trying not getting a limb damaged too much.

It sounds like an interesting mechanic at first, but you kill the enemies faster than you can deal damage to their limbs, so it's worthless.
And good luck if the enemy manages to destroy your legs, as you'll be shit out of luck trying to manuever your heap of metal.

Throughout the game you will have the option to customize your wanzer to you playstyle, with a large variety in the limbs, weapons and attachment.
Which sometimes will be limited by the mission, so you have to adhere to whatever the game requires you to have for a mission.
Most of the weapons and limbs feel at first glance interesting, limbs will have slight different stats, but will increase throughout the game.
But most of the weapons are inaccurate as fuck and deal little to no damage later on in the missions, so you just pick the weapon that deals the most damage.
At least the designs look neat.

Most of the combat is you moving through the arenas, encountering some enemies, killing them and moving on.
But at times you'll be on foot and the gameplay changes to the most generic 3rd person shooter that i've played.
It's hardly anything worthwhile, the only interesting part is when a wanzer shows up and you get the scale of how big they are and how deadly they are to regular infantry.

Controls feels outdated and wonky, but not to the extent that it's unplayable, you'll fight with the ""skiing"" controls though.

Good luck finding any matches in multiplayer.
Horde mode is a DLC and is designed for 4 player coop, so it's worthless. 

It crashes a bunch of times and has bugs requiring a restart of the mission 

Graphically it looks immensly dated and it's not for visuals you'd be playing this game. 

The Story is so cliché filled you could roll your eyes to orbit and back again from how bad it is. 
characters are extremely obnoxious and a lot of times don't act human in their actions or how they talk
villains boil down to smug pilots competing with eachother on who can suck their own dick from how much they love themselves, and for some reason never dies in any boss fight.
only to do a cartooney ""ill get you next time"" shit.
Not to mention you can't skip cutscenes.

Music is forgetable and is that type of generic action game music that just fades with the background and you dont even notice it's playing

Unless you're a fan of front mission in the first place, or really love mech games, i wouldn't recommend this one.
Even then, i'd recommend literally any other mech game than this. | Сюжет для пятилетних. Такая нудятина! Графика мыло. | 10/10 | 👌 🔟/🔟"

Among the Lost Planet series, Lost Planet 2 stands tall as my personal favorite. 
This game takes everything that made its predecessor exciting, harrowing battles against gigantic Akrid, sprawling alien landscapes, and that irresistible Vital Suit action, and cranks it up to eleven.
What truly sets Lost Planet 2 apart is its co-op mode. 
Few gaming experiences have been as consistently fun and chaotic as teaming up with friends to tackle missions, strategize on the fly, and take down enormous bosses! 
Each encounter feels like an epic, adrenaline-filled event. 
I’ve played this game countless times with friends, and every session brought something new to the table, be it triumph, hilarity, or a frantic scramble for Thermal Energy.
The game’s variety of environments is another standout. 
From tropical jungles to snow-covered wastelands, each location feels alive and dangerous, demanding teamwork and adaptability. 
The customization options and unique character classes add even more replayability, allowing players to approach missions in different ways.
Sure, it may not be perfect, there’s a bit of a learning curve, and solo play doesn’t quite match the magic of co-op, but for me, Lost Planet 2 is all about the shared adventures. 
Whether you’re mowing down hordes of enemies or celebrating a hard-fought victory, it’s a game that shines brightest when played with friends.
If you’re looking for a game that delivers action, spectacle, and countless hours of cooperative fun, Lost Planet 2 is a must-play! | CAPCOM, please fix this game!

76561197999482693,22380,Fallout: New Vegas,292.0833333333333,"Action, RPG",59,"This is in my opinion the best first person RPG ever made. Obsidian really knocked it out of the park with this one. The world of Fallout is one of my favorite to visit and this game has plenty to explore. Something to note is that much of this game is set in an open desert which I admit isn't super visually stimulating but there's plenty of unique spots to find within the desert and it makes finding towns and settlements that much more enjoyable but your mileage may vary. In terms of gameplay, this game does show its age in more ways than one, however I don't think this takes away from the game at all. Specifically the shooting in this game is a little janky and hard to get used to but personally I feel this adds to the experience because of V.A.T.S., the sort of auto aim mechanic in the game. Personally I don't have many issues aiming as I've gotten used to the game but for newcomers it can be a learning curve. In terms of the RPG aspect, this game passes with flying colors. You can customize your character a variety of ways and (especially without the DLC raising the level cap) it rewards you for doing multiple playthroughs by trying out different builds and perks. As for the story, there are multiple factions to engage with and the game gives you almost complete freedom on how you choose to deal with all of them. You can even reject them all and form your own path. The soundtrack is also phenominal from both the in-game radio and the overworld music. One minute you'll be listening to classic jazz and country tracks, the next you'll be listening to the creepy ambience as you explore a new cave or abandoned building. The voice acting also leaves little to be desired, with stellar performances all around for basically every character in the game. You will find that many characters sound quite similar, with voices like Liam O'brien and Yuri Lowenthal being used all over the game. This might detract from your immersion but personally I think they do an excellent job with all of their roles and make most of them sound unique. The main game of Fallout New Vegas is excellent in every way I could think of and delivers on everything I want from an RPG. That being said I found the DLCs to leave a little to be desired, especially Dead Money. A fair warning for new players, if you go into a DLC area (aside from the Lonesome Road) you will not be able to return to the main game until it is finished and all of these areas are very high level. The stories of these DLCs also continue and expand on much of the story of New Vegas's base game so I would advise to play them after finishing the game for the best experience. Dead money has a great story but is very flawed. If you did not level any melee abilities before going in, you will most likely have a hard time playing catch up because the guns found here are either not good or are hard to come by. It also has a mute character who uses sign language. Cool idea, horribly implemented. Honest Hearts is some more good old fashioned New Vegas to run around in and I personally found it very enjoyable and it expands well on the main story. Old World Blues is the wackiest of the bunch by far. Many new unique weapons to find and some great quality of life upgrades for your playthrough. I didn't really care for the story, the main characters will talk at you for literally almost 20 minutes straight with nothing interesting to say other than ""funny"" fart jokes to keep you entertained. Thankfully there is an option to skip all this dialogue which I have used to great use on my many playthroughs. Finally, The Lonesome Road is a great capstone for the game. Your mileage with the story in this one may vary, but the gameplay in this new area is fantastic with many new challenging enemies and awesome areas to explore. With that being said, I do not think the DLC is mandatory to play to enjoy New Vegas to it's fullest. I think the best part of the game is the main game and I often don't even go into the DLC unless I'm doing a full run. If you've been on the fence about trying this one, or even just want a good game to play, play it. It will be worth your time and money. 10/10 | I desperately need a remaster of this game, the crashes and bugs make this unplayable at times. This game is definitely the best fallout but not the best game, the attention to detail of many small towns in the Mojave Desert is satisfying and the hundreds of things to do makes this very re-playable. But it is missing one thing, poker. | es horriblemente injugable todo esta mal, en el rendimiento es malo, se crasheea muy rapido y aveces no explica cosas
un 10/10 | The house always wins.

While the graphics didn't hold up well, that should't matter when playing a masterpiece like this.

The amount of choices and nuance is outstanding and it makes me wish Bethesda would more often let other companies have a go at IP's that they hold. 

Is it out of spite that obsidion created the best Fallout game to date that they no longer allow it? Who knows. 

But what you should know is that this is *the* fallout game to play. The courrior's style is as iconic as this game. | The world is huge and meticulously detailed, the mechanics are captivating, and for all the bugs the rewards of persistence are considerable. With a major improved control scheme, the introduction of Hardcore Mode, beautifully detailed environments and national landmarks, Fallout: New Vegas is an absolute gem.

The expansion coming out, hegemony gold, will add sandbox, two new scenarios, more in-depth combat, and diplomacy. A must have for strategy fans. | Very good RTS. While not all flashy as with the Total War series, the depth and actual strategy part is one of the best I've seen. There's no 'form a huge army and bury everything in it's path' here.

I'd highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys RTS and be warned.

It provides the player with clever and intuitive means of managing an empire, battles, supply lines, recruitment, defenses, and resources.  Hegemony aires on the side of realism in its depiction of ancient warfare, so prepare to spend as much time mustering your army and managing supply lines as you do engaging in epic conquest.  But, the gameplay is good, the decisions meaningful, the AI competent (it will test your defenses, lure you into traps, harass undefended settlements, and more), and gives you a real sense of running an ancient Mediterranean empire.  The only real shortcoming is that diplomacy is pretty much nonexistent (you are constantly   fighting almost everyone, if only in small skirmishes, but I guess that's how city-state warfare goes).  Overall, though, a very clever strategy game for a modest price. | Great for strategic thinkers. Learn to deal with opponents on multiple fronts. A huge map of Greece to conquer."

But frequent, basically unfixable, crashing on modern systems has left this older title basically unplayable. Supposedly the GOG version is more stable, but that has sadly never come over to Steam. Valve ought to make it a priority to either fix or remove from the store games that don't work. 

What this game is, though, is Warhammer: Total War-Bretonnia edition. You play as King Arthur in a Total War style campaign pitting you against your fellow Englishmen, Romans, and a whole host of monsters and baddies from English lore. Like in any classic Total War game you manage settlements and armies on the main strategy map, as well as event & decision chains which is where the 'roleplaying' aspect comes in. In battles, you control your force, wield powerful magics, try not to get blasted by the games very powerful archers, and fight your way to victory. The game nails the feel of a TW campaign, and the inclusion of both strong story elements, powerful monsters & characters, plus magic gave the game a very unique feel vs. Medieval or Napoleon, which were contemporaries of this game. One wonders if when WH1 was in development if CA took a hard look at this game, because I see a lot of that game's DNA in this. 

Beyond technical issues, though, the game always sort of lacked something. Battles were small, units are often below 50 entities. Archers are OP, so much so that there is an option in the menu to nerf them! And magics seemed to either be nukes, or do nothing, and so also never quite felt right. And of course, the whole game lacked the polish that WH1 and sequels have. It was good-but-not-great looking even at the time, and a lot has aged badly since then. But past that, this game was a winner back in the day and could be again today. IF you can get it running.

Эта игра не просто стратегия, это целая эпоха, в которой каждый выбор может изменить ход истории. 

Плюсы:
1. Сюжет игры, основанный на исторических событиях, позволяет взять на себя роль одного из кланов и вести его к власти. Это не просто борьба за территорию, но и глубокая стратегическая игра, где нужно учитывать политические интриги, дипломатические отношения и экономическое развитие. Каждый выбор имеет значение, и это придает игре особую глубину.
2. Атмосфера Японии периода Сэнгоку передана с невероятной детализацией для игры 2011 года: от красивых пейзажей до неплохо проработанных юнитов, каждый элемент создает ощущение погружения в игру.
3. Музыкальное оформление заслуживает отдельного лайка! Звуки природы, традиционная японская музыка и эпические мелодии во время сражений создают уникальную атмосферу, которая усиливает погружение в игру.
4. Огромный плюс игры в том, что какую-никакую кампанию можно проходить с другом! Это очень круто, весело и дает больше разнообразия для совместных стратегических действий.

Минусы:
1. Иногда искусственный интеллект может показаться не совсем адекватным, а некоторые элементы управления слишком топорные и требуют времени на привыкание. 
2. В некоторых моментах игра может показаться медленной, особенно в начале, когда нужно развивать экономику и строить армию (на что уходит куча времени).

差不多7年前，我的小学同学就发现了这款大作，那时手机版还没有心动，只有应用商店里的1.2版本，对于当时的我们，手机版1.2只有两个滑轮键控制移动和瞄准，并且局域网联机方便，十分益于上手。我和几个哥们一放假就聚在一起play。当时我们卡在世纪之花这个boss，就聚在学校小花园商量战术，没想到我自己直接单挑过了，还有我第一次打过肉山，是拿蜜蜂手雷和它同归于尽，真的很怀念1.2陪伴我的时光，之后1.2下架，国服代理，为了玩上1.3的泰拉，我在好游快爆苦苦地种玉米（当时可以以此换取游玩资格，否则就要花钱），没想到最后发现还需要早起抢购资格，而我当时可能在上学，没有抢到，努力直接白费。我和同学只能在网上寻找那些还没下架1.2的网站继续玩。
从小学到了初中，以前玩泰拉的朋友各奔东西，但我对泰拉的热情依然不减，后来出了手游国际版我便立即下载，顶着看不懂的英文，摸索1.3的机制，专家模式掉落的装备我都从未见过，新鲜感和好奇心油然而生，初中期间我也找到了一两个一起玩的，使我不至于太孤独。疫情之前，我从来都是只玩手机版泰拉，知道疫情上网课，我终于有机会玩上电脑版了。当时的我对电脑并不精通，也不知道steam是什么东西，于是就在360浏览器直接搜泰拉瑞亚，经过一天的寻找，我也是下到了盗版泰拉（当时我也不知道正版要买）就这么在电脑上再通关了一遍普通模式，但这次没有任何人陪伴，只有我一个人。
终于到了高中，我了解了正规的steam渠道，在打折期间花18块钱买了正版泰拉，为童年补了票，高二认识了几个志同道合的同学，一起玩了灾厄，也是乐在其中。如今，我即将成人，步入大学生活，但我的泰拉之旅还在继续，玩了十几年游戏，只有泰拉瑞亚给我的印象最深，给我带来的乐趣最多，对于陪伴了我78年的老伙计，打多少星已经不重要了，真没想到我能写这么多，回顾了一遍我的童年，我的眼里有些模糊。 | --{ Gráficos }---

Люблю эту игру | The game is fabulous, but a bit more handholding at the very beginning would be nice, because the moment the game started, I had no idea what I was supposed to do or how I was supposed to build anything or use my inventory, so the first few minutes were horrendous, and I was dying quite a lot, which reminded me why I instantly deleted this game many years ago when trying to play it for the very first time. This time around I decided to keep at it, and the first 10–15 hours were slow, but then I got the hang of it, and the game consumed me to the point where I lost track of time and racked up 100 hours just completing the main story and hunting for some achievements. Be prepared to keep your browser running in the background, because you are probably going be switching between the game and the Terraria Wiki quite a lot."
76561197999482693,20920,The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,9.75,RPG,9,"Редкий случай: перед нами игра, которая практически полностью соответствует нашим ожиданиям. Это большая (до 20 часов только на основную сюжетную линию) RPG, предоставляющая игроку довольно широкую свободу выбора и не забывающая, что его, вообще говоря, надо развлекать. Даже гигантские боссы здесь есть, словно речь идет не об экшен/RPG, а о каком-нибудь японском слэшере вроде Bayonetta или еще не вышедшего Asura’s Wrath. Куда уж веселее. Есть, правда, сомнения, как все это воспримут люди, не знакомые с первоисточником, — но такие «Ведьмаком 2» вообще заинтересуются вряд ли. Для тех же, кто помнит еще первую встречу Геральта и Фольтеста и может без запинки десять раз повторить имя нильфгаардского императора Эмгыра вар Эмрейса, игра станет самым настоящим подарком. | ""The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings"" is a critically acclaimed RPG that builds upon the strong foundation laid by its predecessor, offering a deeper, more refined experience. Released in 2011 by CD Projekt Red, the game is set in a dark and gritty world full of political intrigue, moral ambiguity, and complex characters. It follows Geralt of Rivia, a skilled monster hunter, as he becomes entangled in a conspiracy involving the assassination of kings and the fate of the entire continent. The game’s story is rich and engaging, with choices that truly matter, allowing players to shape the narrative in meaningful ways.

One of the most striking features of ""The Witcher 2"" is its branching storyline. The game offers multiple paths depending on the choices players make, particularly during key moments. This results in different quests, character interactions, and even entire endings. The world feels alive and reactive, and the player’s decisions carry weight, making each playthrough potentially unique. This level of player agency is one of the game’s greatest strengths, as it provides a deep sense of involvement in the unfolding drama.

The combat in ""The Witcher 2"" is fast-paced and strategic. Unlike many RPGs that rely heavily on simple hack-and-slash mechanics, this game requires players to think tactically. Geralt uses a combination of swords, magic, and alchemy to defeat his enemies, and mastering each of these elements is key to surviving tougher battles. The game also features challenging boss fights that demand careful planning and quick reflexes. While it can be difficult at times, the combat feels rewarding, and successfully defeating a tough opponent provides a real sense of accomplishment.

The world-building in ""The Witcher 2"" is exceptional. The game’s settings are varied, from war-torn battlefields to lush forests, crumbling castles, and bustling cities. Each area feels unique, with its own culture, history, and lore. The attention to detail is remarkable, and the game does an excellent job of immersing players in its world. The character design is similarly impressive, with a cast of memorable individuals that are morally complex and believable. The game’s voice acting, writing, and character development all contribute to making the world feel lived-in and full of depth.

Another standout aspect of ""The Witcher 2"" is its mature and morally gray storytelling. The game doesn’t offer simple good-versus-evil narratives; instead, it explores themes of power, betrayal, and the consequences of one's actions. Many of the choices players face are morally ambiguous, and there’s no clear ""right"" or ""wrong"" answer. This makes the game feel more grounded in reality, where actions often have unintended consequences, and characters are rarely just one-dimensional.

While the game’s graphics were impressive for its time, it’s the overall atmosphere and attention to detail that truly stand out. The soundtrack enhances the experience, with a score that captures the tone of the game perfectly, whether it’s a haunting melody during a quiet moment or a fast-paced theme during combat.

""The Witcher 2"" is a game that appeals to players who enjoy a more mature and complex narrative. Its story, world-building, and choice-driven gameplay make it one of the best RPGs of its generation. It’s a game that rewards exploration and thoughtful decision-making, and it challenges players to consider the deeper consequences of their actions. With its engaging combat, morally complex characters, and immersive world, ""The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings"" remains a standout title in the RPG genre.

[b][i][h1]Graphics[/h1][/i]
The game has stood the test of time and still looks great almost 14 years later

[i][h1]Original books references[/h1][/i]
The game has many references to events from the books and some interesting characters that the CD gave new life to by adding them to the game and I like so much

[i][h1]Story[/h1][/i]
I really liked the story, it was very interesting and intriguing for me

[i][h1]2 times[/h1][/i]
2 times. You have to finish the game 2 times to see whole content. In the game, at the end of Act 1, you will have to make a choice that will affect the further story. Because of this choice, we have a two completely different Act 2. I mean completely different locations, characters, quests, etc. How many games like this do you know?

[i][h1]Characters[/h1][/i]
Geralt, Triss, Dandelion, Zoltan, Roche, Iorweth.. They are cool

[i][h1]Side quests[/h1][/i]
Here you will see a lot of good side quests in the game and I don't remember of a single bad one. I'm serious here. I really don't remember a single bad side quest in the game[/b]

[h2]±[/h2]

[b][i][h1]Music[/h1][/i]
The ambient is beautiful, I really liked it very much. About OST.. There is not much OST in The Witcher 2. And among this small number there is a really good OST but there is very little of it and hearing the same OST every time in the same location throughout the entire act is a bit disappointing[/b]
[hr][/hr]
[h2]-[/h2]

[b][i][h1]NPCs[/h1][/i]
They are not alive. They do not have their own daily routine as it was in The Witcher 1. They either sleep or stand in the same place and do the same animation

[i][h1]Broken economy[/h1][/i]
The traders here are richest people in the world because they sell things for some unrealistic prices, but you sell them for pennies, and it doesn't matter if it's trash or one of the best armor in the game. You really have to grind(kill monsters and sell them for nothing) if you WANT to buy recipes and craft armor set that appears on higher difficulty in each act. I only lasted for two acts. Not for me

[i][h1]Combat System[/h1][/i]
Absolutely broken. Set traps for a few seconds [i]during[/i] combat? Traps that Geralt should set before combat? Yes. Enemies block your attacks without block animation? Yes. Enemies ignore your attacks and continue their attack animation and kill you? Yes. CD in one of the updates disabled health regen during Quen, thinking that it was better? YES. Bad QTE? Yes. Bombs and knives are OP? Yes. I wouldn't say that these problems greatly affect the gameplay and perception of the game, but the fact that they exist is annoying. The combat system in The Witcher 1 was much better

[i][h1]Tons of cut content[/h1][/i]
Typical CD Projekt[/b]
[hr][/hr]
[b][h2]9/10[/h2] | Most people said that TW3: Wild Hunt is more enjoyable if you've played the first two games first. After doing so, that most certainly isn't the case. These felt kind of like a waste of time overall, I'd say you're good just playing the third if you're unsure of where to start. 

The main reason I went back and played the first two Witcher games was because I started a playthrough of TW3 and felt like I was so behind on the lore and characters of the universe. I kept encountering characters that the journal said Geralt had met in previous adventures until finally I decided to cut my losses 50+ hrs in and complete the first two games first before returning. 

But both stories in the first games are fairly inconsequential. TW1 is definitely unnecessary, only giving you a glimpse of who Geralt and a few of his closest friends are while pursuing a criminal organization. TW2 shows the political state of the kingdoms just before the third game, and some brief flashbacks into Geralt's forgotten past before his amnesia, but that's it. 

None of the characters I'd thought were in the first games like Ciri, Yennefer, Keira Metz, Sigismund Dijkstra, the two people burning at the stake in a certain city that the journal says Geralt knew, etc, are even in them. Okay, maybe one of the people burning at the stake is at least in TW2 but they were just a merchant near the end of the game with one line of dialogue, at least in my playthrough. They had no role in the story at all. I'm left to assume most of the story I thought I missed out on is in the books, not the earlier games.

So I gained nothing from playing this. On top of that the games were kind of boring. Dialogue was decent but even compared to the first game TW2 was disappointing. TW1 impressed me more in some ways. 

The quests felt more involved in TW1, where simply following what we were being directed to do in the journal could lead to screwing ourselves over. I often had to think, and pay attention to what someone said earlier for a clue on how to properly move forward. Nearly every time I made progress during a quest, I could chat with a character I knew who would have new dialogue for me, unlike TW2. Sometimes we could talk to a character other than the one on our objectives for a better outcome. Here everything is just straightforward, follow the next objective, no thinking required. 

Romances in TW1 felt more rewarding and the opportunities were much more numerous. I didn't even pursue them and ran into quite a few. It felt like a mini-game of its own since there were romance cards to collect. Looting also felt more important, whereas in TW2 we just get a bunch of crafting items/herbs I never even used. Most of it I just sold since I had so much with no use for it. And not being able to select the loot individually felt dumbed-down. Potions felt ineffective in TW2 and having to predict when I might need them was annoying since we could only consume them while meditating, so luckily they could be largely ignored on ""Normal"" difficulty. 

I could describe a bunch of other things that TW1 did better, but also some things in TW2 just weren't as much of a step forward as I'd expected. There weren't many choices I made in the game that I felt made a difference later down the line. The game failed to introduce a sufficient number of interesting characters throughout the story; there are very few worth remembering. Contracts were also very scarce and simplistic. The monster variety was severely lacking, mostly just Nekkers, Endregas, Harpies, and occasional Rotfiends. Gear still felt minimalistic in that it wasn't impressive-looking and there wasn't much to be found in the entire game. The variety in areas the game takes you to isn't there either, it's just 3 different locations all of which are boring: a swamp outpost, a muddy camp, and some old ruins. The game basically all happens in settlements, like the first game.

Also TW2 is a short game, only 36 hours and I took my sweet time + read all the journal/character/location/monster entries.  It's really only better than the TW1 in graphics and combat, and the TW1 wasn't a great game either. 

Both of these are like a 7/10 for me. Enjoyable enough to make it through one full playthrough, but I've no desire to ever play them again. Hopefully TW3 actually lives up to the hype, and I'll at least have some characters appear in it which will help make the time spent here worthwhile when I import my save to it.

Bastion is an indie classic, really unique game that holds on a decade later after its release. | 도대체 왜 압도적 긍정적인지 모르겠는 희대의 거품 게임인 Bastion이다.

그래픽이 어쩌고 저쩌고 내레이션 목소리가 어쩌고 저쩌고 하겠지만, 다른 리뷰에서도 적었듯이 게임은 게임다워야 게임이다.

게임의 태그에 '액션'이 붙어있는데도 액션성이라고는 개나 줘버릴 정도로 조작감이 불편하고 타격감이 부족하다. 또한 플래포머를 표방하는 척 하지만 점프의 재미가 아닌 그저 추락 낙뎀을 위해서만 존재하는 어설픈 플래폼을 깔아놨을 뿐이다.

내레이션의 목소리는 멋지지만, 스토리는 전혀 흥미롭지도 멋있지도 않다. 멀티 엔딩이랍시고 게임이 끝나기 직전에 스토리의 분기를 나눠놓았는데, 고작 그 하나의 선택이 의미가 있는 갈림길이 될 수 있다고 믿었던 것일까? 심지어 하나의 엔딩을 본 후 다른 엔딩을 보려면 처음부터 다시 시작해야 한다. 그냥 부족한 게임의 볼륨을 억지로 늘려놨을 뿐 그 이상도 그 이하도 아니다.

더욱 놀라운 사실은 도전과제중 score attack mode에서 일정 점수 이상을 넘게 받아야하는 것도 있는데, 이것까지 완료하려면 이 재미도 없는 게임을 세번이나 플레이해야한다는 것이다. 물론 도전과제는 필수적인건 아니지만, 이미 억지로 플탐을 늘려놓은 것을 확인한 이상 속이 뻔히 보이는 불쾌한 술수라는 것은 부정할 수 없을 것이다.

여담으로 이 개발사의 후속작은 Transistor인데, 그 게임 역시도 너무나도 재미가 없어서 때려치운 상태이다. 최근작인 Hades가 그렇게 재밌어서 상도 받고 했다는데, 두번 연속 데인 상황에서 다소 믿어지지는 않긴... 하다 | A história é excelente, a narração pode irritar um pouco no inicio mas ela é essencial para o entendimento da história e uma hora você se acostuma e passa a entender a importância dela.

The bad part is that it does crash some times but its not that bad, often do you have a autosave spot close by and just play it from there. | Better feel then remastered version where they just made all the building and unit pictures smal in the map view instead of remaking them in lower resolution.

Bought the remastered but I dont play it.

Claro que pra quem se interessa no período em que ele se passa, talvez valha dar uma conferida.

Achei o combate terrestre bastante chato, o que pra mim é o que torna ele o pior da franquia que eu já joguei.

Sendo o líder da nação você será responsável na questão militar, social e econômico, lutando em batalhas, lidando com rebeliões, estabilizar as cidades entre outros.
Eu amo esses tipos de jogos em que você pode ""moldar"" o passado e se tornar poderoso, além disso, gosto de micro gerenciar as coisas.
A melhor parte são as batalhas e cercos, indo desde uma batalha naval até um cerco em um forte. Nesse jogo não é só os números e a habilidade dos regimentos, mas o que pode definir define uma batalha é a SUA estratégia, o inimigo pode ter tantas tropas quiser, se você souber o que estiver fazendo e ter uma boa estratégia você pode ganhar uma batalha ""perdida"".

Beautifully crafted campaigns put you in the shoes of one of history's finest tacticians; the battles, thrilling and visually stunning, pay attention to historical detail, bringing the Napoleonic era to life.

For fans of the Total War series or strategy games in general, Napoleon is a must-play. Few games make history as exciting, and Total War: Napoleon does just that brilliantly. 

Highly recommended!!! | The base game is lacking in any real diversity in unit selection outside of the major Nations i.e.: France, UK, RU, Prussia, etc. I'd say over 99% of my time on this game for over 10 years (exclusively multiplayer) has been with the NTW3 community mod from Lordz modding collective. I have to say that although the game engine shows its age with the mods installed, its an excellent game. ""Vanilla"" (/ the base game) could see significant improvement if some more minor nations were added along with adding more historical units to the base rosters. If Lordz modders and contributors can do the research for free on their own and implement it without any compensation, then CA can too, but we all know the current state of CA. Get the game for the many mods if you want something with good multiplayer replay value. | Quite fun, the mechanics can be hard to understand at first but they are really nice once you get used to them.  Only complaint is the camera, I wish I could go higher and have more camera manouverability. | [b]Beware: Occasional Crashes is really annoying sometimes.[/b]
Overall, the gameplay is solid. Battle really felt great, some units overpower the other but that's balancing. The only downside is that there are no gore whatsoever in this game, You'll need a mod to do that."

first and foremost, dead game. has been dead for a while, and games like this tend to need players to unlock its best gameplay.

but the most important thing that holds this back is the bots. i've played countless RTS games against AI and the likes. there are plenty of RTS games where there also is little to no players, but i enjoy them because i can still play a typical game against an AI opponent. in this game, there is no RTS commander, and therefore basically no reason to play because almost everything this game is relies on that.

tower stacking makes it a lot less interesting but kinda required with how grindy it is. wish there was an option for no trading but increased rates. 

information should be more public with droprates/item quality. having to dig through discords to figure out how certain game mechanics work, or how some areas are just terrible to farm feels really bad.

worth trying if you really like tower defence games and are looking for something different. buy everything on sale tho. 

 | Since 2014 I have only had the PS3 to play this game on. It was old, but I would get on every month or so to play a little, just because I liked it so much.

A few days ago I saw this on sale, and prior I hadnt even realized it was on PC. I bought it and booted it up, only to realize that not only was it better than its PS3 version, but it was still regularly updating.

being able to buy and train marines to board enemy ships and take them over.
new ships for all races
bigger universe
9 different story line missions
better wing control
better settings for MK3 traders

the path finding AI is somehow worse in this game then the last, i cant count the number of times i lost ships or even my own ship going through a gate.
the Xenon M7........why lord give them an M7. O and it can show up in random space on patrols.
out of sector combat is even more screwy then before (see Xenon M7 one shoting M2s)
MK3 traders are even more like to die to random things (see Xenon M7)
a couple story line missions are riddled with game breaking bugs
random bugs having to due with things like npcs talking on coms, half the time i had no idea what was going on because of this

Can not recommend. | X3 is one of those games where you need to spend about 20 hours or more just learning how everything works.  Controls are kinda all over the place, stuff can be pretty janky at times, and overall it's just a pretty old game which can give it that outdated feeling.

В отличие от первой части, The Darkness 2 отличается улучшенной графикой, стилизованной под комиксы, и более быстрым, динамичным игровым процессом. Игра добавляет новые возможности для использования тёмных сил, таких как управление руками-щупальцами, что делает сражения более захватывающими и стратегичными.

В отличие от The Darkness, которую я так и не смог испытать из-за её эксклюзивности на консоли, вторая часть вышла на более широкую аудиторию, став доступной для ПК, PlayStation 3 и Xbox 360, и дала возможность насладиться уникальной атмосферой и геймплеем большему числу игроков.

The Darkness 2 не только продолжает историю Джеки, но и углубляет его внутреннюю борьбу с тьмой, предлагая зрелищные моменты, интересных врагов и сложные моральные дилеммы. | Si un jeux Venom devait exister dans le futur, il serait surement une copie de The Darknes, mélanger le plaisir d'être possédé par un symbiote a celui d'être le DOOM Slayer et vous voila avec The Darknes, un jeux qui a compris ce que l'on voulait voir et vivre si un symbiote existait."

Very atmospheric. The sound design is great. The concept behind the game makes the gameplay super unique, and makes it so certain details get revealed in ways other narrative games don't. The pacing is great, with upgrades being given at just the right times so the main mechanic never becomes tedious. 

The only non-positive (not even that negative really) things I'd have to say are that I didn't personally find the story super engaging until around the end, and the lack of vr settings. Totally understand reducing motion sickness as much as possible by default, and when there are no settings, this is certainly the better way to go, but I'd much prefer being able to walk and jump around than only be able to do short teleports.

And to finish off the good-""""bad""""-good sandwich, I really like how the vr version gives you more control over the map and allows you to shoot the lidar around corners. I also appreciate that there aren't any active monsters, with the only real threat being in the lake area. I don't think I would have liked it as much if I were being chased, but the idea that something *might* be there was enough to keep the tension going. | アイディア勝ちの良作。

The visuals are beautiful and the mechanics behind it are immensely satisfying. The story that unfolds is good, but I won't speak more on it because spoilers. My only gripe with it is that on one or two occasions the movement felt a little clunky but besides that I have no complaints. 

Also, this game is more or less a one and done deal. It's bite sized, very cheap, with eerie elements and an amazing soundtrack.

I love this game. I used to play it on my low spec netbook that struggled even running chrome, it ran this game well. There are a ton of better ARPGs out there, but none of them are as ""minimalist"" as this one. Single dungeon with multiple levels, basic classes and skills, small town with quest givers. It is a bare bones ARPG and that is not necessarily a bad thing. Not having to stress over synergies (non existent) complex skill trees (as basic as they come) makes this game perhaps the coziest ARPG out there.

 | Щоб пограти в неї в кооперативі (чим ми й займалися), довелося встановлювати сторонній софт, аби гра хоча б через LAN могла підключатися. Це зайняло багато часу на розв’язання проблем і працювало не дуже стабільно, але пройти гру було можливо — що ми й зробили.

У цілому, суть гри зводиться до одноманітного знищення мобів і босів та лутінгу. І якщо з останнім усе чудово — гра пропонує багато цікавих предметів і можливостей для їх покращення — то баланс у боях на рівні майстер залишає бажати кращого. Спочатку проходиш гру комфортно, без особливих труднощів, а потім  раптово зустрічаєш рівень, або боса, який буквально вичавлює з тебе всі наявні ресурси. Можливо, на нижчих рівнях складності баланс кращий, а може, навпаки, занадто легкий — не знаю.

Сюжет цілком нормальний для такого жанру, графіка хороша, анімації скілів чудові, та й у цілому прокачування кожного персонажа цікаве. Але гра різко обривається, хоча за предметами та розвитком персонажа було відчуття, що вона має тривати хоча б до 70-го рівня. Хотілося більше часу на прокачування, а не просто проходити те саме вдруге, як пропонує гра.

Загалом, класно, що розробники створили щось нове, самостійне й не схоже на інші всесвіти, але реалізація вийшла трохи сируватою — чогось не вистачає, а щось, навпаки, варто було б доопрацювати. | Accessible, Fun, has mods to add complexity, and I could run it on a toaster.

76561197999482693,205530,Gratuitous Tank Battles,0.0,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",0,"Gratuitous Tank Battles can be an incredibly fun and rewarding game. Remember the fun it was to build your own custom ships on games like Master of Orion? GTB is a tower defense game that's like that for every single unit or turret. From the smallest cheap gun to the big strongholds, from inexpensive recruit infantry to heavily shielded mechs.

Designing the units is simple, but the management of new and older designs can be a little busywork. But this kind of complexity that usually lacks on modern games is very welcomed.

The very fact that this games plays as both a traditional tower defense game and an inverted tower defense game is a testimony to its flexibility. It's a robust selection of units with great variation of strategies you can use to beat the enemy.

At least for me, the fact that you can design, customize and name every unit in the field adds to the enjoyment and creates a very fun experience when your guys are winning a battle. It's just most interesting when that tank unit you built to be fast and strong barely makes it to the finish line.

Building units is not everything, and the battles are intense and complex.

Apart from the built-in campaign, you can edit your own scenarios, and upload and download challenges from other users.

If you like Tower Defense games or games with customization, this is a very good choice. | Though I really enjoyed Gratuitous Space Battles, I found this one thoroughly inferior. The customization found in GSB simply doesn't exist in GTB. There's no actual modification available, really. You simply unlock new items and those new items are, basically, always better. Whereas in GSB, you had to balance crew-size, energy, weight, cost; in GTB it's basically cost and that's it. NOT recommended. | ENG:

One of the best, if not the best tank strategy game on Steam, a simple and addictive game. Referral! :3

FIN:

Yksi parhaita, ellei paras tankki strategia peli Steamissa, yksinkertainen ja koukuttava peli. Suositteluni! :3 | Ok, maybe i need to have more time to discover how to use my units correctly (4.4hrs when i wrote this) and maybe i suck ass, but i can't help feel that there is just way too much going on to take in. GSB did feel like that at first but i think what kept me playing that is because i was able to distinguish better what worked and what didnt. With GTB however, it feels more like, ""spam more than the enemy can handle"" kind of game.

When i tested out my own custom units as an attacker, i did win, but i couldn't quite make out how i did with what designs were effective and it felt like it was just all about spamming faster than the enemy can place its units down. I did see a couple of units really stand out but that was all i was able to take in and didn't feel as if they made a real impact to the game and was more about having more guns than my enemy to break through their defences.

As the defender, different story, after a solid 40mins of deciding what to put in my turrets and so forth i used them in battle, but it seems as though my theory of ""the spammier the better"" really came to fruitition as my enemy was constiantly fielding units that eventually meant i couldnt keep up with stopping the flow with the supplies i needed. I admit, i may have made classical n00b errors, such as not using the speed settings to help me better make sense of the battle (D'oh), and i noticed how most of my turrets were fitted into Anti-Armor roles. Maybe i just need to go back to the drawing board like i did with GSB, but honestly, after playing a few games of what felt like ""the spammier the better"", i saw no point and scrapped all of my turret designs.

You see with Space Battles i was able to figure out roughly where i went wrong if i lost a battle. Sometimes it was a design that ended up being obsolete with enemy designs or not being able to fill the role i intend it to. But with Tank Battles it didn't feel like that at all. It felt more like all of my units were at fault and the unit stats at the end did nothing to help me at all. I just couldn't make sense of all the information being given to me.

Though as i said at the beginning, i probably suck and need to put more time into this game for its goodness to really shine, but it felt like a real dissapointment from its Space counterpart, and besides, i have never been one for Tower Defence style games anyway as i always find the genre having little strategy and mainly focusing on who spams best. Tank Battles seems to be the same story then as always for me, just with customisation of units being a nice feature to it all.

5/10. A game that looked promising along with the customisation features but maybe that is due to my love of its space daddy counterpart. Overall, i am dissapointed, hope i can come back to this and it convinces me to change my mind.

If you love TD games, this may be for you but may not be exactly your cup of tea, and all the customisation and info that this game bombards you with may put you off in the end, aside from that, i advise you save your £6.99 (£11.98 with the DLC included) for a rainy day and look elswere.

And as for me, i am off to play GSB in order to cheer myself up by blowing alien ships up for no apparent reason, at least i can make sense out of all the chaos...oh well...

*readies plasma cannons* toodles. | The pseudo-sequel to GSB patches up a lot of things that its predecessor didn't do as well.  You now have to equip something in every slot of your models, you can customize their appearance much more, the battles are asymmetric and you have to control things instead of passively watching, and the different maps provide a lot more variety than the void of space.  I would recommend it more highly except that the battles take so darn long.  I'm sitting there for 15, 20 minutes or more, either fending off waves of enemies or throwing my troops into the grinder, and there's still half the mission to go.  It feels more slog than fun, sometimes.  It just… lacks something, some ineffable quality that other TD games have.  
Also, the unlock system was partially better in the previous one.  I'm many games in, and most of the way done with the campaign, but there are still bunches of things to be unlocked.  The other one gave you points for every victory and you could just buy the things you wanted in the store (often several for a good-scoring mission), but this one gives you one scripted thing and a choice between 2 other equips after each fight.  This is good in that the scripted ones ensure you get the important stuff first, but bad in that it takes a [i]lot[/i] of missions to unlock everything.  
Jury's still out on the balance, but it's replaced its predecessor's ""here are 5 equips that vary slightly from each other"" for any given category with ""here's a small, medium, and large thing - what'll it be?"".  That, combined with the fact that attacker and defender use almost the same gear, means that I'm skeptical of the potential variety.  Will have to play it more.

Ed. So, after coming back to it for a while, I don't think my views have changed.  It still feels like your decisions are mostly dictated by the map and your budget, not your overall battle plan.  There's room for creativity in unit design and deployment mixes, but the fact that you can only put guys/turrets/support structures in pre-defined places really limits how you can play the level.  For the attacker, it's even worse, since you have to send your troops down specific routes, and they always seem to get snarled up by traffic jams.  The game lacks any realism in having wrecked tanks block your way, but injured ones at the front of the line will still slow you down.  The attacker is supposed to have the advantage at the start, since they get more cash more quickly, and the defender later, since they never run out of income and keep all their non-destroyed defenses on the board.  However, it really feels in most maps like the defender has an overwhelming advantage from the get-go.  With the right placement of troops and turrets, they can get such a volume of fire in one spot that your line of vehicles, advancing single-file, will get picked off one at a time before they have a chance to do much damage.  And if they have a repair yard nearby, what little damage you do inflict will be fixed in no time.  Perhaps I just haven't hit on the right combination yet, but this seems somewhat shallow to me, as the first one did.
It's still not a bad game, and worth exploring for a while if you enjoy this type of thing.  There's a lot of replay value to be found in the maps and the asynch multiplayer skirmishes."

 [b] 2007 yılında GOTY kazanmış bir oyunla karşı karşıyayız. Tabii ki bu remastered versiyonu yani günümüz ses efektlerine ve grafiklerine ayak uydurabilen hali.[/b]

[h3] Hikâye ve Arka Plan: [/h3]
Oyunun hikayesi, kaliteli bir roman gibi oyuncuyu içine çekiyor. 1960'larda bir uçak kazası sonrası okyanusun ortasında hayatta kalıyoruz, kazanın yaşandığı yerde olan deniz fenerine gitmemiz ile okyanusun altında olan distopik şehir Rapture ile tanışıyoruz. Sözde Ryan'ın '' bireycilik ve özgürlük '' vaadiyle yarattığı bu şehir, kısa süre içerisinde kaosa yenik düşüyor. İnsan doğasının karanlık yanlarını sorgulatan, kapitalizm ve sosyalizm gibi felsefi temaları harmanlayan bir hikâyeye sahip. Özellikle sonlara doğru “Would you kindly?” gibi şok edici bir olayla hikayeye başka bir anlam katıyor. Kısaca karşımızda düşünülmüş ve kaliteli bir hikaye var.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3409545052
[h3] Ses Tasarımı: [/h3]
Ses tasarımı konusunda hiç üzmeyen bir yapım kendisi. Savaştığımız yaratıklar yani splicer'ların ürkütücü fısıldamaları, sesleri ve konuşmaları vs olsun, Big Daddy'lerin metalik homurtaları, yürüyüşleri ve Rapture'un su altı atmosferindeki derin yankılar vesaire olsun başarılı olmuş. Ses tasarımı oyunun atmosferini bir üst seviyeye çıkarıyor.

[h3] Grafik ve Tasarım: [/h3]
Oyunun ilk dakikasından da anlayabildiğimiz gibi grafikleri güzel ve yeterli. Genel olarak aydınlatma ve doku detaylarıyla güzel bir izlenim bırakıyor. Eski versiyonuna göre su efektleri olsun, karakter modellemeleri olsun kısaca geliştirebildikleri her şeyi geliştirmişler ve remastered adına uygun hale getirmişler. Genel olarak 2007'deki versiyonun kaliteli hali olduğunu unutmazsak, Rapture'un art deco mimarisi ve retro-fütüristik tasarımı, zamanın ötesinde bir iş olduğunu hatırlatıyor. 

art deco ve retro-fütüristik tasarımdan kısaca bahsetmek gerekirse şöyle;

art deco: 1920'lerin ihtişamını ve modernizmi yansıtan, geometrik formlar ve lüks materyallerle bezenmiş bir estetik anlayışıdır. Bu tarz, zarif simetriler, parlak yüzeyler ve egzotik desenlerle hem geçmişin büyüsünü hem de çağdaş bir zarafeti bir araya getirir.

retro-fütüristik: Geçmişteki insanların geleceği nasıl hayal ettiğini yansıtan bir estetik anlayışıdır. Bu tasarım yaklaşımı, genellikle 1920’ler ile 1960’lar arasında oluşan geleceğe dair öngörüleri içerir. Özellikle bilimkurgu eserlerinde sıklıkla kullanılan retro-fütüristik tasarım, nostalji ile geleceğin teknolojik hayallerini harmanlar.

Bioshock tasarım konusunda mükemmel bir yapım.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3409671861
[h3] Skill Sistemi ve Geliştirmeler(Plasmidler ve Genetik Modifikasyonlar): [/h3]
Oyunu eğlenceli kılan kısımlardan birisi de karakterimizi genetik olarak modifiye edebilmemiz. Bu modifiyelere plasmid diyoruz. Savaştığımız makinelere ve yaratıklara şok dalgaları gönderebiliyor, onları dondurabiliyor veya arı sürüsü salabiliyoruz. Tabii ki bunlarla kısıtlı kalmıyoruz telepati gücümüzü kullanarak yaratıkların üstüne bir şeyler fırlatarak da hasar verebiliyoruz. Farklı mekanikler farklı oyun tarzları demektir. 

Ek olarak kullandığımız silahları geliştirebiliyoruz ve farklı özellikler ekleyebiliyoruz. Örneğin ben kullandığım İngiliz anahtarına buz yeteneği takmıştım bu sayede vurduğum düşmanlar donuyordu ve öldürmesi daha kolay oluyordu. Kullandığımız ateşli silahlar içinse farklı geliştirmeler var. Silahlardan bahsetmişken de oyunun oynanış süresine göre çeşitlilik yeterli.

[h3] Kontroller ve Mekanikler: [/h3]
Kontroller ve mekanikler genel olarak akıcı. Ben genel olarak çoğu yere koşmaktan çok zıplayarak gittim. Zıplayınca hızım eksilmediği için ve bazı oyunlardan bu oynanışa alışkın olduğumdan böyle oynamak daha eğlenceli geldi. Bir nevi bunny gibi bakabilirsiniz ama o kadar hızlı ve akıcı değil. Mekanik dediğimiz konuya da aslında skill kısmında baya bir değindim. Seçtiğimiz yetenekler ve silahlar ile oynayış tarzımızı şekillendirebiliyoruz. Hatırladığım kadarıyla yeteneklerin arasında daha zor fark edilme gibi şeyler vardı ama sessiz ilerlemek pek bana göre değil. Seven varsa oynarken o yetenekleri seçebilir.

[h3] Düşman Çeşitliliği: [/h3]
Oyunda splicer dediğimiz bir tür var. Bu türün kendi içerisinde farklı güçlerde ve çeşitlerde varyantları var. Bu varyantları kısaca anlatmak gerekirse;
[list]
    [*]Thuggish Splicer: Yakın dövüş silahları ile saldırıyorlar ve hızlılar. Tek saldırmak yerine genellikle 2-3 kişi yani grup halinde saldırıyorlar. Bazı yeteneklerimize bağışıklıkları var ama o kadar zorlayıcı değiller.

    [*]Leadhead Splicer: Ateşli silahlar ile saldırıyorlar bu yüzden de genellikle bizimle mesafelerini koruyorlar. Sağlıkları ise Thuggish türünden biraz daha fazla.

    [*]Spider Splicer: İsminden de anlaşıldığı gibi örümcek gibi takılıyorlar. Oyunun karanlık bir atmosferi olduğu için genellikle karanlıklarda tavanlardan ya da duvarlardan üstümüze atlıyorlar. Yakından savaşabildikleri gibi biraz mesafe ile kanca da fırlatabiliyor. Biraz sinir bozucu bir tür.

    [*]Houdini Splicer: Bu eşekler örümceklerden daha fazla sinir bozuyor. Yaklaştığınızda ya da hasar verdiğinizde ışınlanıp yer değiştirip saldırmaya devam ediyorlar. Işınlanmalarını duman bulutu ile az çok anlayabiliyoruz ama yine de bazen sinir bozabiliyor. Bu arada bu türleri öldürmek genel olarak zor değil, toplu olarak saldırdıklarında bazen sinir bozucu oluyorlar.

    [*]Nitro Splicer: Ve son olarak bizlere el bombası ya da yanıcı bomba atan varyant. Telekinesis gücümüzle bombalarını geri onlara fırlatınca pek bir esprileri kalmıyor.
[/list]

Splicer'ların davranışları, ses ve görüntü tasarımları başarılı. Bazen kendi aralarında laf atışmasına girmeleri de hoş olmuş.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3409674869
[h3] Hikâyenin Derinliği: [/h3]
Uzaktan bakıldığında FPS oyunu gibi gözükse de, aslında çok daha derin bir yapıya sahip. Andrew Ryan'ın idealleri ve Fontaine'in manipülatif planları, oyunda insan doğasını ve etik seçimlerini sorgulatıyor. Hikayenin sunduğu ahlaki ikilemler, Little Sister'lar üzerinde daha da belirgin. Kurtaracak mısınız yoksa hasat mı ediceksiniz ? :)

Hikayeyi derinleştiren diğer bir unsur, çevresel anlatım. Genel olarak linear bir yapıya sahip olsa da bölümlerde ek kısımlar var. Yani birazcık keşfedilecek yerler eklemişler. Bazen geçmişten gördüğümüz halüsinasyonlar olsun, etrafta gördüğümüz ve bulduğumuz eski yaşantılar olsun bir zamanlar mutlu ve güzel bir yaşamın olduğunu gösteriyor. Bizlere o eski ihtişamı güzel bir şekilde gösteriyor. Rapture'un nasıl çöktüğünü gözlerimiz önüne sunuyor.

 [b] Kısaca Bioshock kesinlikle oynanması gerekilen oyunlardan birisi. Etkileyici grafikleri, tasarımları, hikayesi ve oynanışı ile kesinlikle bir şans vermeniz lazım. [/b]

In the case of Borderlands 2 developer Gearbox has decided to largely stick with what worked the first time around, while implementing a host of tweaks that make it an overall superior game. A few relatively minor complaints aside, Borderlands 2 improves not only the narrative, but almost every major game system. If you’ve been itching for a reason to jump back into the world of Pandora, Borderlands 2 provides a more than ample supply.The hook of Borderlands 2, the very reason that I found myself thinking about it when I worked or tried to fall asleep, is the loot. Guns, ammo, character skins, grenade mods, class mods -- there’s always something just a bit better, something you so desperately didn’t even know you needed until you found it in Borderlands 2. Just like Diablo or a number of other action RPGs, the hunt for loot becomes intoxicating because of the tiny rush you get each time a rare colored item spills out of a chest or is dropped by a recently slain enemy. Every firefight and intense boss battle becomes all the more rewarding, because, though you might die a few times and want to crush something near you in real life, it suddenly feels like everything is going to be OK when you’re blasting away enemies with a newly looted gun. | só tem gente perturbada, armas, violência, animais perigosos, uma milicia que quer controlar tudo, nenhum policial á vista e um ambiente inóspito a vida humana.

Конечно, в ряду существующих шутеров и RPG Borderlands 2 не выделяется новаторским подходом в плане боевой системы или ролевых элементов.

 | Orcs Must Die! 2 – це продовження першої частини, яке додає ще більше битв з орками та динамічного геймплею. Найбільша перевага – можливість грати вдвох, разом планувати розташування пасток і захищати замок від хвиль ворогів. Також стало більше варіантів покращення пасток, що дозволяє експериментувати та створювати власні стратегії.

If you don't want to rely heavily on traps, you can go with projectile or melee weapons, or you can go full no-touch mastermind and use only traps and maneuvering, this is left up to you in the most organic way possible - you just pick the equipment you prefeer at the start of the round and that's it.

If you wish for a surface level horde shooter with fun abilities then it will give you that experience in spades, however, it also has the ability to allow you to delve deeper into its systems and lets you customize and maximize your arsenal until you become a walking army.

The story is serviceable in the beginning but in my opinion ages like wine as you progress through the star chart, slowly pulling you into an experience that I have yet to relive in any other Sci-Fi game I've played. While it does go off the rails at times it does so in a way that feels believable and maintains a sense of internal consistency that keeps you informed while still asking questions.

Each frame feels unique even though the devs have released over 50 differing characters, each with a unique kit that (while falling into a manageable amount of categories such as caster vs weapons-platform) still allows players to express their own uniqueness through their selection of frames and weapons. It is rare that any two players' loadouts will be identical to one another.

Brutal Legend é uma baita homenagem ao rock n' roll em geral, incorporando todo o apelo dos seus diferentes subgêneros num cenário totalmente literal. No controle de Eddy, interpretado por nosso querido Jack Black, exploramos um mundo aberto em plena Era do Metal, um futuro apocalíptico onde a música e a magia são basicamente a mesma coisa. Os humanos, divididos e hostilizados, são ainda escravizados por hordas de demônios, em meio de biomas diferentes e de paisagens impressionantes. A muralha dos amplificadores, a floresta da cerveja e as minas do gelo seco são apenas um gostinho do que há no cenário, onde muitos dos seus NPCs são baseados em ícones reais, como Ozzy Osbourne (Black Sabbath) e Lemmy (Motorhead). 

Com um gameplay fraco e bastante repetitivo, o fantástico mundo aberto é preenchido por atividades repetidas que podem ser encontradas a cada novo bioma explorado. Elas se consistem em saltos com o nosso carro customizável, o ""Diabo Flamejante"", várias corridas, além de coletáveis como solos de guitarra e estátuas de dragão. A missão principal oferece menos enrolação, onde levamos a luta através da nossa ""turnê"" diretamente aos caricatos vilões. Há também um sistema de batalhas de palco contra palco, onde controlamos tropas num estilo de jogo de estratégia em tempo real. Esses momentos são específicos de trechos da campanha, apesar de representarem 100% do seu multiplayer, onde jogadores podem batalhar entre si (Sim, o online ainda funciona!!).

Obviamente, a trilha sonora de Brutal Legend é o seu maior destaque, contendo músicas licenciadas de tudo que é tipo, que variam entre heavy rock/metal, power metal, thrash, death e power metal. A experiência, autêntica e cômica, me atraía sempre que me dava vontade de ouvir uma música boa, ao invés de simples vontade de jogar um jogo.

It is turn based and linear; you go out on missions, then return to your home to level up, re-supply, pick up side missions, and progress the story.

At first I was disappointed, but the story and atmosphere sucked me in.

Their are 5 races (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Orc, and Troll) and 6 classes (Samurai, Mage, Decker, Rigger, Shaman, Physical Adept) but racial limits on attributes and skills are disappointingly limited. There's no point in making a troll as anything other than a Samurai or Physical Adept, for example, as their racial limits would prevent any other class' skills rising above 6 points (out of 15)

This game was never going to be a runaway success, It’s design as a tactical action shooter left it firmly in the shadow of the unreleased X-com: Alliance. An FPS Squad shooter slated for 2001. But releasing this near simultaneously with Enemy Unknown was a detrimental mistake that buried this game.
Which is a shame, because its not bad- despite a few questionable design choices.

[h2] This doesn't make the best first impression [/h2]

Ahem. If you check out the steam discussions many will complain the AI is underwhelming, which it half-true. The companions are lobotomised, until you get them to level 5. Then they become responsive and more importantly have enough health to not immediately keel over & die to every encounter.
Any orders you direct to your squad are immediately carried out, they even change texture to illustrate they’re following your commands. Their actions are queued and each class has their own set of unique abilities all designed to synergise.
Support casts Disrupt, you use the ability levitate, then Recon uses Critical strike. 
Congrats!
You just killed everything except for a Muton or Sectopod. If you time it right.

Commands are done through a proto Fallout 4 VATS system where time slows down, and there is even a mass effect dialogue wheel for interacting with characters. It’s neat. 

The squad is limited just to three which sucks since the player counts as a unit.
Mind control is a late game action which really adds tactical variety. Deployable drones, Turrets and Silacoid’s all work surprisingly well.
The combat is satisfying once you level up your roster of companions. Don’t worry about the permadeath, you can simultaneously send new recruits off to do automated missions as you play which levels them up.
A Total party kill is easily replaceable with no disadvantage, just customise the new squad to look like the old.
By the mid game I didn’t need to micromanage my companions anymore, they could tank most things, the AI automatically avoids grenades to the point they’ll never be hit. It’s nice… You just have to get them to level 5 because the starting health pool and their lack of abilities really screws with the AI’s capability to dynamically react.
These soldiers were lobotomised in the early game, they do get better.

[h2] The difficulty is meaningless [/h2]

You will never fight more than two mutons until the final level, you will only encounter a maximum of two Sectopod’s, only a handful of optional side missions have Sectoid’s swam you on mass and the Outsiders and all their variants can be managed systematically. Difficulty has no bearing on the mechanics.
It just nerfs your abilities and turns everything into a bullet sponge if you raise it.
Whilst I completed it on Commander difficulty, I did replay a little bit on novice and the early game was more enjoyable. The spawns didn’t change, only the enemie’s health.
Call me old fashioned but a Muton shouldn’t have more health than a Sectopod, quadrupedal tank. But on commander oh boy they do.
There is no intended difficulty unlike in classic X-com or Enemy unknown. Play around with it.
Find a comfortable balance between your damage output and the enemy’s strength.

[h2] It has the spirit of X-Com [/h2]

It's no secret that a bunch of X-Com fans rejected [strike] Two & Chimera Squad [/strike] because it betrayed the core themes of the franchise.
The indomitable human spirit adapting and overcoming Alien, Lovecraftian and interdimensional threats. A rag tag group of rainbow resistance warriors isn’t X-com.
The idea that we’re in waters so uncharted that despite have an entire facility, bureau, military or even a full-on megacity at your disposal. And you’re still on the backfoot is X-Com. It’s the best of the best having to rise beyond their limitations to save humanity. It shouldn’t be a plucky underdog story.
It’s a war of attrition between the best & brightest and the horrors of the uknown.

The Bureau, X-Com declassified [i] gets [/i] this. It understands the necessity of having an established facility which is impressive considering there is zero research or base management. 

Everyone around you is a highly trained professional from various background selected to defend humanity. It’s X-Com with a little more personality and a stronger than average narrative. 
Is it a good narrative? 
Eh, it has major pacing issues. There are only 7 mainline and 7 optional missions. But it doesn’t playout as predictably as the classics or Enemy Unknown does, someone was having fun writing this and whilst its brevity takes away from the intended emotional impact… 
It has more going on than most 7th gen shooters. 

[h2] The none existent technical hic-ups [/h2]

A lot of people state this game doesn’t run on windows 11.
I have the dreaded 24H2 build and it runs perfectly. [b] First time booting the game did take several minutes [/b] but every start up afterwards was immediate.
I’m running an Integrated RTX 3050 4gb, hardly cutting edge stuff for the 2020’s and the game ran with out a single crash.
The cutscenes are pre-recorded in 720p with some terrible compression. It looks bad.

There is full controller support right out of the box, plays well with my 3rd party Xbox One controller. No issues.
The texture work is surprisingly great, you can read almost all the chalkboards, posters and graffiti present in the environments. It adds to the conspiracy latent atmosphere the game is striving for.

[h2] It’s well worth it when on a sale [/h2]

For $2 of $5 it’s a fun little distraction, it’s hardly the betrayal Spoony [Godspeed my sweet prince, find the help you need] led me to believe it was back in 2012.
It’s far from the worst entry in the franchise.
Sure, if Alliance was playable this would be a redundant entry (Unless you really liked the cold war aesthetic) but as some one who brought this after sinking 150+ hours into Enemy within in the space of two weeks, yeah this has the X-Com spirit I yearn for. 

10-15 Hours of gameplay, if you get the DLC then I could see 20 at a push. There is no new game plus or randomly generated missions everything in this game was purposely designed which is something of a lost art now-a-days.

I will add the marketing for this game did it no favours, like seriously. This isn’t a bad game it’s just that everything surrounding it, including its marketing absolutely betrayed it. Heh. I guess there was betrayal after all. | Para mi es un juego clásico de Xbox 360, con una muy buena historia y opciones de juego. 
 | It's not a bad game. The story is set in an alternate timeline to the mainline games, and you get to experience the conflict from another perspective. Too bad we don't see [i]all[/i] the enemy types, and the forced squad management is more annoying than helpful, but it's not a complete disaster.

Do note, that there are technical issues with this game on modern hardware: PhysX tanks your performance even when it works, high frame rates will make you stumble on level geometry, some triggers may fail to trigger, so you'd stuck and will have to restart from a checkpoint. | Really bad dialogue. I thought I'd be able to ignore it and just enjoy the gameplay, but there are big sections of dialogue where the characters are rude to their coworkers and allies for no reason. They're not rude in a funny or entertaining way, just randomly mean. | World and story is decent, but the gameplay is just boring and dated now."
76561197999482693,204450,Call of Juarez: Gunslinger,22.05,Action,15,"Call of Juarez has really great story telling and voice acting, and decent duck and cover gameplay. Mostly is it really cool game, but there are enough quirky mechanics that could hamper your experience.  The style has elements of genius that is worth playing if you can pick this up for a few dollars as it can be completed once in 10-15 hours. 

Your character narrates his role in the wild west and explains his tall tale version of what ""really"" happened during key events of US old West history.  It has a great comic book like style to introduce classic outlaws in an epic fashion, and the world is bright and beautiful with romanticized farmhouses, mine shafts, moving trains, and mountains.  The levels are mini areas that allow you to run within a defined arena as you hide behind structures and gun sling your way past groups of outlaws as the narrated story offers entertaining, color commentary to all the events. 

The game felt more like a shooting gallery style on rails rather than stealth strategy.  I mostly liked the ducking for cover and the shooting since your character can take some bullets yet quickly recover if you stay out of the next wave of attacks. You can pick up just a few basic pistols, rifles and shotguns to keep it interesting, and also upgrade a few power ups that allow you to carry more bullets, or to throw back incoming dynamite.  The gameplay also has an interesting dueling mode for some of the bosses where you need to increase focus meters, and out draw the enemy.  The historical nuggets that you can find on each level add a side study of the many outlaws who become the stories of the 1800's United States.  It is a great combination of tall tale and non-fiction.

As the game went on, the difficulty suddenly would ramp up and the quirks of the game became more apparent.  The enemies blend into the background making them super hard to see, yet they would easily spot you behind any barrier.  The voices of the enemies seem to come from all around and sound like they are right next to you, even when they are 50 yards away. The Q ""Concentration"" button helps to slow down the action and to outline your enemies but for me it would burn out so fast before I could do much. I was disappointed in the perk system as I used my points on the Silver Shotgun, Ranger Gun, and the Ornate Sawed off since they seemed like the best weapons, although as the game progressed it seemed like the regular Rifle was important to reach far enemies, and the standard Quick shooter was better for rushing enemies.   The game has a few quick events that popped up at very random times and most likely will surprise you and kill you.  When you die, sometimes the game has a tendency to place you immediately in mortal danger only to die again on the same group of enemies.  I kept dying over and over chasing a dynamite fuse that blew up in 5 sec, and I could not even see what direction I was even supposed to go.  Some of the bosses had glitches or quirks and I do not understand how I passed them besides getting a little lucky.  
For the boss Henry Plummer, I could not figure out why enemies were hitting me when I should have been safe behind a barrier. Yet somehow after many, many tries, I lucked out and he suddenly died, and I can only guess that I blew up the dynamite in his hand.   For the boss Curly Bill, he got stuck while running in place in the lumber yard so I just kept shooting him until he died.  For the boss, John Wesley Hardin, I could not figure out what the game needed me to do in the dueling event as I would draw, dodge, but the aim target would wander off. Eventually after many tries, somehow the target worked but I did not feel satisfaction that I did anything differently.

There is a lot to be loved about the style of this game, which is why I recommend playing it despite the quirks.  There is more gameplay with NewGame+ and Dueling Mode  and it may spark your curiosity to learn a bit some of the outlaws during a crazy era of US history. | [h2]🎨 Graphics [/h2]

Gunpoint es un juego de puzzles y plataformas, pero con un enfoque más pausado, donde prima la estrategia y el sigilo. Somos Richard Conway, un espía freelance (autónomo) que por casualidad es grabado por las cámaras de seguridad en la escena de un crimen, el asesinato de Selena Delgado. La jefa de esta mujer, Melanie Rooke, se pone en contacto con nosotros para pedirnos que recuperemos la grabación donde aparece el asesino real de su empleada y amiga Selena, chantajeándonos con que de lo contrario, la policía pensará que nosotros somos el asesino. De este modo deberemos infiltrarnos en distintas instalaciones bien vigiladas para hackear diversos dispositivos y obtener información sensible. Sin embargo, poco a poco iremos adentrándonos en una red de conspiraciones mucho más profunda de lo que cabría esperar, donde se ven implicadas las grandes empresas armamentísticas del país y la policía. Por ello, diferentes personajes contactarán con nosotros para reclamar nuestros servicios o pedirnos ayuda con diversos problemas personales, siendo nuestro principal objetivo desenmascarar al verdadero asesino de Selena.

[h2]Jugabilidad / Apartado técnico[/h2]
Gunpoint nos ofrece diferentes misiones de dificultad y complejidad creciente, donde el principal objetivo suele ser colarse en instalaciones fuertemente vigiladas para hackear algún ordenador, robar objetos clave o escuchar conversaciones privadas. Para ello, nuestro espía podrá hacer uso de una gran variedad de gadgets y dispositivos de alta tecnología que harán su labor de infiltración mucho más sencilla. Por un lado, contamos con los pantalones Bullfrog, los cuales nos permiten saltar grandes distancias, noquear a nuestros enemigos o caer desde alturas sorprendentemente altas. Por otro, iremos adquiriendo nuevos aparatos que harán nuestra vida más sencilla, siendo el Crosslink el más importante. Este dispositivo introduce las mecánicas de puzzle al juego, permitiéndonos ver la instalación eléctrica del edificio y “recablear” diferentes aparatos a voluntad, como interruptores, puertas, cámaras de seguridad, lámparas, etc. En cada misión deberemos hacer uso de estas mecánicas para completar las distintas misiones que nos ofrezcan, tratando de cumplir con ciertos parámetros de sigilo, violencia, tiempo, etc., y siendo recompensados económicamente por nuestros servicios para así, hacernos con nueva tecnología.

[h2]Valoración[/h2]
Gunpoint es un juego de puzzles realmente bueno, que sabe introducir las mecánicas de acción y sigilo de una forma muy interesante. Su jugabilidad es muy dinámica, ya que primero nos obliga a observar y pensar tranquilamente cómo vamos a llevar a cabo la misión, decidiendo que aparatos recablear, qué puertas debemos tomar, la ruta de vigilancia que siguen nuestros enemigos, etc., para luego llevar nuestro plan a la acción de forma rápida y limpia, sin ser vistos ni morir en el intento. La forma de abordar cada misión puede ser diferente y creativa, dejando cierto poder de decisión al jugador para tomar distintas rutas o usar diferentes aparatos. Además, también podremos elegir entre varias opciones de diálogo con nuestros clientes, pudiendo modificar el resultado final de la historia. En resumen, un gran juego de puzzles que recomiendo probar y que ofrece entre 6-7 horas de entretenimiento.
Lo salvaría de un incendio! 👨‍🚒👍🔥

 | Trop de bug cheval qui fait des sauts problème de gravité et de son | It took me more than 10 years to finally beat the main quest. This game is old. I'm old.

76561197999482693,214950,Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition,191.7,Strategy,50,"So, this might actually be my favorite Total War game.

I know, I know...someone is recoiling at the thought that I didn't say it was the original, Atilla, etc...but this one just works for me. I don't think Rome I could have had a more worthy successor, all things considered. Did it have a poor launch and could there be some more improvements to make it even better? Yes, and yes...but even now after Warhammer and all the rest, I hold this one to be the Modern Total War Gold Standard.

I've played it so much over the years since launch. I don't even know how many hours since they kept getting reset back in the day, but going by the current tally I know it is A LOT. The controls and combat are pretty intuitive for [i]old[/i] Total War players like myself and for the more modern players. In fact, a lot of the systems you see in later titles got their starts here, so if nothing else Rome II has that going for it.

The setting is just a really dynamic period in history and lends itself well to being able to experience completely different playstyles with the varying factions. There are other Total War games where, as a consequence of when and where they are set, you really all just fight with the same roster of units. That is not the case here. Yes, there are plenty of reskins to be found, but even those aren't always 1:1. The ""jack of all trades"" faction here is, unsurprisingly, Rome. Meanwhile, there are other factions whose rosters focus on more niche that really make them play completely differently. There are some factions that pretty much only rely on cavalry while others heavily encourage long lines of pikes and hoplites. This alone makes the game very replayble since you can hop into something very different whilst keeping all of the familiarity of all of these modernized Total War mechanics...at least modernized circa the last major update.

The campaign map is a fun strategy-management game in of itself, but the battles are where things really shine. You have land and naval combat here, something that wasn't possible in the original title, but had to come from the likes of Empire: Total War. Combat here doesn't play like that other game, though. It is much more of the time focusing on boarding, ramming, and burning. Once on land, combat feels fairly satisfying. You can really develop good strategies with certain army rosters. The AI is, well, still AI, but overall it does tend to give you a reasonable enough challenge. Of the Total Wars, this one is definitely in the decent to good AI camp.

I can't really speak for the multiplayer quality, as it is not something I ever really participated in; however, I can point to the fairly reliable number of active players as indication that, at the very least, there are always people in the greater Rome II community to engage with.

Yes, I could really go on and on about this game, but if there were only one thing I could leave you with it would be this:

I have played every total war game (except Three Kingdoms and that weird mobile one, but I digress), and out of all of those games THIS is the one that I always come back to. I just think it is neat.

With all this said, [i]I highly recommend picking this up,[/i] but if you do so I do recommend going ahead and getting it in a bundle with the DLCs...on sale, preferably. 

It's not that the base game is barren without the extra content; but, as someone who has put hundreds of hours into it, I really can't imagine playing the game without that extra content.

[b][i]Vae victis![/i][/b] | This game is great, but sadly I became the victim of the ""loading screen bug"" lottery.

For some reason on new pc's the battles won't load and you are stuck on the loading screen, it seems that there are no permanent fixes for this so sadly I just can't play the game. This won't happen to all players but for me this means the game is unplayable sadly.

In a way this is a good thing, as I will not be spending next 1000 hours of my life into this game like I was planning to. The Tutorial was very promising. | To make it perfect, I disable civil wars. It takes all your resources to fight the barbarians. I don't like killing off my army every hour or two. I have tried to maintain their loyalty, but it takes lots of effort out of the game play. So get a mod to make it less of a headache. I will play 426 more hours of this, until Rome total war 3 is released. As a Latin Teacher, I approve of this game. | 罗马二YYDS，想玩的朋友记得先去创意工坊下（1）中文mod（第一个必下的mod)；接着下一个(2)每回合四分之一年的mod，因为原版是每回合1.25年，时间过得很快，将领、皇帝一下就老死了，都升级不了多少，因为这个mod必须在每个存档建档之前开才有用，你开了存档玩过以后再开此mod就没有用了，所以建议一定要先开这个mod再建存档；（3）下一个无腐败mod，不然到后面你财政崩溃，入不敷出；最后看个人可以下一个无内战mod，这样就可以专心对外征服了。非常不错，也很好玩，真心推荐全战新手第一部玩的作品！ | Rome II in its current state is a fun game which received lots of love to get it to this state, because oh my gosh on release especially considering the advertising and the games that came before it in the series it was terrible. Unfortunately, in a lot of ways it is still too little too late, and if you look at what Creative Assembly has released in the series following this they did not learn their lessons from the failures of this game and have since doubled down on those failures. Any game in the total war series after this one suffers from the lack of character, lack of polish, and blatant cash grabby attitude that has come to dominate the series. 
What does this mean for you as the prospective buyer? These games can be fun, I think you can get good value out of them, but understand that this company at one time was capable of accomplishing far more and giving you a far better product, but either through incompetence or greed they have chosen not to. I think its important you know you're being served fast food and being told its fine dining."

Bom, esta é a primeira vez que jogo um Sid Meier. E tenho que admitir que, contra minhas expectativas, fui positivamente surpreendido.
Além de seguir acontecimentos reais, o jogo oferece várias possibilidades e estratégias. Além do mais, mesmo sendo totalmente leigo, como é meu caso, ele é bastante intuitivo, mesmo se depois leva tempo para dominar.
Ao mesmo que oferece diversão, oferece desafios para todos os gostos.
Da próxima vez darei mais bola para um jogo da franquia.

76561197999482693,251060,Wargame: Red Dragon,0.0,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",0,"Don't bother with this game if you want single player modes. They're a buggy, janky, poorly made afterthought with lazy, cheating AI. 

The campaign map mechanics are especially a mess, full of random quirks that make no sense. For instance, if an enemy attacks into your big army, none of your ground units can move until you fight the battle, and then the battle magically depletes ALL initiative (move points) for ALL your units! So they can keep you from ever moving your army again by just suiciding something tiny at you every turn. 

And then the way zone control for battles changes is super buggy, the core logic itself is quite convoluted, there are a lot of reasons zone control can change from battle to battle. But even besides all those rules, sometimes it will just randomly change, you'll have just won a total victory and routed the enemy army, and then they attack again next turn and nonsensically you're knocked down to Alamo configuration (one zone versus all others) for no reason whatsoever. 

I could go on...moving your aircraft to a new airfield uses up all movement, when it should be as simple as ""hey, just land here when you're done this turn 'k?"" The ""routing retreating armies"" mechanic seems like it wasn't playtested, it can be really easily exploited if you have a helicopter squad, doing silly nonsensical things like sending that heli squad out over an enemy sector so it doesn't get its entire initiative zapped by a fight, then when the enemy army routs, send those helis at the retreating army, and voila, you just eradicated an entire enemy army with 4 helis.

The git gud edgelords will say any criticism is because you suck, but no, I'm beating the campaigns. It just feels cheesy, buggy, and undeserved when you're losing, until you figure out how to exploit the AI and janky game mechanics, and then it feels cheesy, buggy, and undeserved when you're winning. | [h2] Продолжение одного из самых масштабных варгеймов!

It got me out of unemployment, it reconected me to my family, it got me a masters degree, it turned me into a master athlete, it revived my jedi master, it tought me how to ride a bike and so much more. 

This is the answer to all your questions. AMEN! | It's just too arbitrary and trial and error. For me, rng and ""losing is fun"" works in roguelikes but it doesn't work in VN's, which is basically what this is.

So the whole ""losing is fun"" thing works in roguelikes because you're developing your character and you're in an open world and making tactical decisions about what to do and where to go and which skillset you're going to use to try and navigate a situation and how to maximize your skillset. And when you die (in a good roguelike), you go ""yeah, I know exactly what I did wrong and it was avoidable"". It works because you make all the tactical decisions and you choose where to go and you're the one responsible for losing or not.

Long Live the Queen on the other hand, you need to be spoiled or you just keep dying. You need to know what events are coming in advance so you know what skills to prepare for them and what moods to set this person in so you can best learn those skills. I've also read that some skills are utterly useless noob traps. 

There's no playstyle like in other ""losing is fun"" games where you say, ""Ok, I'm just going to focus on this skillset and play the game using this skillset heavily"".... because you don't have different paths to choose from, You just have one event after another placed in front of you and sometimes you just get killed and that's that.

From what I see there seems to be a fair amount of rng, too. You can do all of the above, get the right skills, and still fail the check. In my time with the game this chick couldn't pass a skill check to save her life (literally), even in skills I'd heavily developed her in.

The game has a really nice aesthetic and music and I think that's a big contributor to the review scores. But imo it's really not fun to play. | A melancholic puzzle game disguised as a Visual Novel that contains enough intrigue to keep you interested through the constant anxiety the game induces.

Ceder ante esa banda de tóxicos pseudojusticieros a buen seguro que a la larga ha sido todo un palo para la desarrolladora y la publicadora, porque dudo que los wokes empezaran a comprar el juego tras la censura.

Hay que tener en cuenta que los anteriores desarrolladores introdujeron algo de censura, pero los nuevos cogieron la tijera de podar y se han puesto a eliminar cosas que no tienen sentido, porque si bien se parodia al régimen nazi, nunca se los pone como a los buenos de la película, y si bien las escenas introductorias de Big Band eran muy duras, en ningún momento mostraban aquello como algo digno de elogio y/o a imitar, sino todo lo contrario. Sí, Skullgirs era un juego gamberro, pero eso era parte de su alma y nadie estaba obligado a comprar el juego.

En resumidas cuentas y viendo que me han cambiado el producto que compré, me veo en la obligación de suspenderlo. Tras todo lo publicado, posiblemente alguno pensará que soy otro zombi de la alt-right, pero nada más lejos de la realidad. Soy una persona con unas profundas convicciones de izquierdas, pero claro, cometo el pecado de ser una persona muy de los 90 del siglo pasado, y siendo un español descendiente de personas que huyeron de la dictadura franquista, me deja perplejo que parte de la izquierda actual viva obsesionada con reinstaurar una censura más bien propia de un dictador al que presuntamente desprecian. | Jogo muito bem feito, mas só recomendo pra quem não fica de mimimi pra qualquer coisa. | This is the perfect example of a fighting game that's clearly well-made but not for me.

What started off as an indie game is clearly inspired by Marvel vs. Capcom, and it shows. A lot of the mechanics follow the typical team-based fighting game style with assists. The main gimmick I like is that you can (in theory) pick only 2 or even 1 character and have your health scale up, but generally, this is not recommended.

The character designs certainly ""stick out,"" but I've personally never been into the art style of Skullgirls; it definitely has that ""early Western indie game"" feel.

While the game is kind of fun to mess around with solo, I just don't think it's as enjoyable or polished as later (or even earlier) team games when playing against any competition. The balance is super whack and heavily reliant on combos and Touch of Death mechanics, with not many good defensive options.

The story mode is amusing enough, and I'm glad it's fully voiced, but I just didn't really care about any of the characters by the end, even though I completed all the story modes (in the Switch version).

When this game was one of the few to actually use GGPO rollback netcode, I might have given it a more positive recommendation. However, with so many more dynamic, better-looking, balanced, and more fun-to-play versions of anime-style/team-based fighting games available now, Skullgirls just doesn't hold up for me personally these days.

I do have to give props for showing that indie fighting games can be a thing, especially lasting over a decade. | This is quite simply, mechanically, the best tag fighter on the market and it came out in 2012.  that says a lot.  tier lists? useless.

It has that claustrophobic, creeping horror feel of the first Alien movie. It's fairly simple to understand the gameplay initially, but mastering it takes a good bit longer in terms of experimentation and refining tactics. It's been out for a long, long time now, but routinely [i]still[/i] gets updates. It's stable as a rock - I've never experienced any bugs or crashes, and it's always been smooth to play even on lower-end hardware. AND IT SUPPORTS LINUX AND MAC -- thank you for that extra effort, devs!

The procedural nature of the galaxy creation for each run makes for a good bit of variety. And, I find myself getting attached to my little drones.

コマンドラインインタフェース（CLI）か手動操作でドローンを操作して、宇宙に放棄された数多の難破船を探索するゲームです。
いい雰囲気のゲームではありますが、単調といえば単調なため、合わない方もいらっしゃるかもしれません。
セールで買った値段だとかなりお得に感じました。
ゲームを遊ぶ上で読まないといけない部分は非常に簡単な英語で構成されています。

探索中の難破船の船体がｷﾞｷﾞｷﾞｷﾞ...という軋み音、コンソールから発せられる注意の音や警告音で焦らされ、接敵時に滅茶苦茶ビビらされ、のんびり探索してたらドアをこじ開けられたりベントから侵入されたり放射線に晒されたりします。
慌てて判断ミスをするとドローンが半壊/壊滅して大惨事になるゲームです。
面白いけど怖いのが苦手な人間からすると心臓に悪い。

探索するフロアはドアロックで区切られており、行きたい部屋に敵がいないか確認しながら探索を進めます。
部屋が安全そうであればCLIで操作し、次の部屋の情報が不明であったりした場合は手動操作に切り替えて様子を見るなどして進めます。

探索パートでは、如何にして手持ちの装備で敵をかいくぐりながら物資を集めてゆくかを熟考しながら進めます。
但し、探索する船が年季の入った宇宙船なのであれば、生物の根城にされていたり船が壊れそうになっていたりと危険が一杯です。
例えば
・ベントから敵が侵入
・ドアをこじ開けて敵が侵入
・船が劣化してエアロックが破損してリークが発生
など。
そのため、慎重且つスピーディな探索を要求されます。

CLIに慣れてくると全てのドローンを効率よく作業させられるようになるため、探索スピードが上がり自身の成長を感じられます。
また、aliasもあるので、よく使うコマンドや誤入力するコマンドは登録しておくとより効率的で快適な探索が可能となります。

 | This is one of my favorite games.  Equal parts frustrating and addictive.  They hit the theme 100% on the head; I feel like I'm alone in the big dark of the Aliens movies.  Very gritty, very real.  At its heart it's a puzzle and programming game.  You can move your little drones manually, but programming them to do their stuff is mandatory; there's even a meta batch file where you can create subroutines -- and you'll need 'em.  I love that it's programming in 2 different ways: first, the straight-up coding of getting your little dudes to do what they do; second, the programming of utilizing all of their skills appropriately to survive.  Tack on an awesome dark, lonely space theme and some very cool lore (which you discover as you go) and you've got a super fun game that I highly recommend! | nice little game for cheap with a eery but not spooky athmosphere | Atmospheric.

Такая игра про Первую мировую — поистине жуткая: сидя в окопе, я видел, как моим союзникам отрывали ноги и руки, простреливали насквозь и делали дыры в головах.

Очень запомнился момент, когда мой товарищ по имени танкист попросил меня прийти к нему в окоп за помощью. Прибежав туда, остались лишь изувеченные мертвые тела солдат... На то место сбросили тяжелую артиллерию.
А ещё захватывает брать пулемёт и взбираться на гору с открытым обзором на противника: стреляешь по врагам как в последний раз, ощущение — будто действительно на войне. Очень грустно наблюдать за умирающими солдатами, держащимися за шею или живот; страшно видеть товарища, которому пулей разрывает руку или пронзает шею... Он лежит и кричит в муках несколько минут — зрелище жуткое и одновременно грустное.

Игра впечатляет: такой реалистичный шутер о Первой мировой я ещё не встречал. Даже без живых игроков можно пострелять, наслаждаясь атмосферой. Кстати, лучше играть под музыку — например, слушая ""Свидетельство о смерти"". Это добавляет совершенно новые ощущения. Лучшие вложение на 142 рубля в моей жизни
Ставлю оценку 9/10! | 15年的游戏，可惜16年战地1出了之后由于题材相近但内容贫瘠基本鬼服。之前e宝还免费送过，打折入性价比中规中矩，游戏比较挑人。
目前是9张地图4种模式（能够自定义房间的只有一种模式），玩法相对来说比较乏味，没有可操控载具纯步兵战斗（以4人小队为阵营单位）。一大优点是有bot模式，可以打电脑人，简单难度的游玩体验一般，主要原因是bot行为太过迷惑，敌人能卡位一枪秒玩家，队友连玩家身后都不会掩护，更离谱的是就给小队配装这点时间图上的电脑队友都能把阵地丢了，导致64人推图大战役无论击杀多少敌人都不耽误你输。还有糟糕的地图划区黑枪，防守方出战壕半步都是逃兵警告，缓冲区能不能设置得大一点。
有人可能会吹觉得打不明白或者步枪一枪死就“很真实”，我看来游戏真实性一般，瞄准时准星乱飘还不能屏息，冲锋枪飘得比步枪更厉害，在现实中但凡你碰过真枪都会觉得真不至于，游戏里那手抖得像帕金森一样。步枪躯干一枪死导致玩家和bot近距离对枪容错率很低。换弹动画都是一套，比如鲁格中途换弹肘节枪机就自动抬起至空挂，相比同时代的fps游戏还是比较失真的。最舒心的一点是游戏内容很纯净，没有像BF1那样魔法瞄具自动武器满地跑，武器严格按照年代设定，另外服装考证也很细致，各国进行曲也很用心。
游戏缺乏教程引导（选择阵营和兵种要在进图按esc键我打了好几局才知道），地图卡脚，人物动作略僵硬，虽然糟心的地方有很多，考虑到开发商是一家孜孜不倦更新的小工作室，故给出好评。如果是单纯追求竞技的刺激感的玩家不太建议入。

The game itself though ehhhh..

Gameplay is okay, but also very shallow, you're just spamming all your cooldowns. There is no customization at all for the campaign. Voice acting, at least the english, is unfortunately rather poor and all over the place. Another review mentioned different microphones - they are right, it is in fact painfully noticable. I attempted to switch to the japanese voiceover out of desperation, only to discover that, for some reason, all the Japanese VA's used noticeably worse quality microphones.. interesting.

Again, for 1 dollar? Great, sure. Can't complain, honestly, I got what I paid for. From a ""Okay but lets be honest for a moment"" perspective.. when I say indie I mean INDIE indie, and not in a good way. Still, I do see that a lot of passion was put into it, and I can respect that.


Edit: Played more, felt the need to update.

Lots of bizzare design choices in this title. I'm not sure who decided that I needed to suffer a lethal dose of cringe every single time anyone talks in the campaign, but that was a bad call. The control scheme overall is annoying to use.

如果说 POE2 将来可能成为最好的 ARPG，恐怖黎明现在就是最好的 ARPG。ARPG 新手可以无脑入，DLC 也全买，有 DLC 才是完整游戏。而对于 ARPG 老兵，恐怖黎明有什么特别的？

它从头到尾都尊重你的时间。

现在的赛季制 ARPG 游戏，重心都放在了终局，而低级的剧情阶段不过是走过场，好像是为了尝到终局的甜而必须吃的苦（POE2 有改进但还不够）。恐怖黎明不是。从游戏的最开始，ARPG 的两样核心，build 和 farm 就在成型了。

Build 是寻找最优解，是谜题和选择，恐怖黎明更快更多地把谜题摆在玩家面前：
- 技能点升一级不是给 1 点而是 3 点
- 镶嵌物从 5 级开始就很重要，而不像其他游戏因为需要打孔是后期内容，这里不需要打孔
- 星座相当于 POE 中的被动技能树，但有意义的大点更靠前，这些会赋予主动技能触发特效，是 Build 的基石，而在很前期就能体验到
- 加技能等级的装备和套装在前期就开始掉落，可以完全按照得到的装备来进行开荒 Build

Farm 赋予了玩家游玩的意义，POE2 和 D4 前期不会有任何 Farm，因为没有意义，前期装备非常弱，很快就要被替换。这也是这些游戏前期与后期游玩体验的割裂的原因之一，而恐怖黎明通过很多巧妙而统一的设计，让前期的 Farm 更有意义：
- 精妙的数值设计，一件 50 级的装备和终局的装备，在面板上看是两倍的数值而不是十倍或百倍，开荒期的装备保质期更长
- 一些怪物有特定掉落，这些掉落非常适合于某些 Build，甚至在终局是最好的装备
- 装备槽位多，总共 14 个，比起 D4 这些多出了护肩和勋章等部位，这意味着掉落提升角色的可能性更大
- 慷慨的掉率，独特的史诗装备和传奇装备相当于其他游戏的暗金和套装，掉得更早更多，DLC 更是提供了新的掉落途径
- 势力声望系统，Farm 至少会推进声望，而声望奖励非常优越，一方面可以直接买很好的开荒装备，另一方面终局总是需要买声望给的增辐，所以前期的 Farm 也为终局做了准备

恐怖黎明还有太多优秀之处，如手工设计的地图，塞满了奖励驱动，或是 Build 的丰富性，或是数值上的精妙，也不需要一一提及，能做好前期的 Build 和 Farm 就值得每一个 ARPG 老兵的时间。
这也不是说恐怖黎明在终局的 Build 和 Farm 就不出彩，只是我刚通第一个难度全 DLC，还没打到终局，没什么可说的。
总之推荐给每一个人，这游戏里每一秒都是值得的，在 ARPG 里很少见。 | Great ARPG with the most free choice in skill tree combinations I have seen, combine trees and you can build pretty much whatever you want. Lots of unique items to specialise things even further. No seasonal slop, no ""always online"" garbage. There is so much build potential I keep coming back again and again. There's even secret stuff for you to find.

My only gripe is after playing so many hours, I wish I had a little more bank space to store things.

还有这新dlc2023年就有消息了  2025年了 居然还没玩上 | Falo com convicção: este é o melhor ARPG isométrico da atualidade - que não está na categoria de ""jogo como serviço"" — caso contrário, Path of Exile 1 e 2 seriam ótimos concorrentes . Nem mesmo a Blizzard conseguiu entregar um ARPG à altura desde os clássicos Diablo 1 e 2. Dentre os vários pontos de destaque de Grim Dawn, eu consigo citar os seguintes:
- O sistema de combinação de classes é bem diferente, você tem ali (considerando as DLC's) 9 classes base, e podendo realizar a combinação com mais uma classe, você tem a possibilidade de criar até 44 classes;
- Habilidades e poderes trazem peso e fluidez ao combate, fazendo com que cada encontro seja satisfatório.
- A atmosfera sombria, aliada a uma narrativa rica e bem construída, me manteve engajado e curioso sobre o desfecho da história.
- Conteúdo de Endgame: Repleto de desafios, dungeons, facções e atividades para explorar, garantindo horas de diversão mesmo após finalizar a campanha principal.
- Suporte a Mods: A possibilidade de mods amplia ainda mais a rejogabilidade, permitindo aos fãs personalizar e expandir o jogo ao infinito.
- A trilha sonora ambiente é excelente e contribui muito para a atmosfera sombria do jogo, lembrando o estilo marcante de Diablo 2. 
- Já a temática se destaca por fugir do convencional entre os ARPGs, que geralmente exploram criaturas mitológicas, demônios e fantasia medieval. Grim Dawn aposta em uma ambientação inspirada na era vitoriana, com inimigos interdimensionais devastando a humanidade — é uma premissa inusitada, mas que traz uma originalidade bem-vinda. 

Não posso deixar de elogiar o cuidado da Crate Entertainment com este jogo: sem monetização abusiva, passes ou qualquer outra prática predatória, e ainda assim eles continuam atualizando o título mesmo após 8 anos de seu lançamento.

Recomendo. | Отличный диаблоид с нотками Dark Fantasy, мир разнообразен на локации: полянки, леса, болота, подземелья и все по классике жанра, в ней приятная ламповая хоть и немного контрастная графика, она хорошо сбалансирована как для казуального игрока так и для мазохиста, и я считаю он лучший на рынке в своем ценовом сегменте. (на скидках стоит в районе доллара) 
Grim Dawn может спокойно конкурировать с гигантами в виде Diablo IV и Path Of Exile 2."
76561197999482693,238910,Bionic Dues,0.05,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",0,"I was first introduced to Arcen games through the AI War franchise, so that was the one that I've experienced for the first time. And as fascinated as I was with the setting, I've heard that Arcen games had more games that were based on the same universe as AI War, an ""Arcen-verse"" if you will. Since I was curious about the whole universe, I've decided to go through the games.

So Bionic Dues is set on one of the earliest events of the chronology of the Arcen-verse, there is a robot uprising on earth, the bots have destroyed all ""fighting mechs"" but the 4 we have on our hands, and they have taken over the entire city. We have to put an end to this rebellion, else our CEO overlords will nuke the city to prevent the bot rebellion from spilling over to the sterile parts of the civilization.

When we start the game, what we see is a city map, with routes to take between different points, just like the star lanes in any other tactical game with a space setting, just like in AI War for example, only that there is a city wallpaper at the background of these starlanes instead of a galaxy wallpaper. 

We only start with our own HQ at the beginning, and as I've stated before, the AI has taken over the entire city, so all the other beacons are in ""AIs control"". This looks pretty much like the galaxy map in AI War already.

On top of that, each of these beacons have a different kind of bonus to provide to the player if you choose to conquer them. And, when you conquer a beacon, more beacons on the map that you don't know about are revealed. These are pretty much the same features as in AI War 2. 

By the point I've realized this, I was a bit frustrated at how similar this game was to the AI War series, as much as I love AI War, I've expected this game to play much more differently than AI War for the difference in genre. They could have at least made the city map function more like a grid map instead of a star map, and sure enough that would have made it feel better imo; as opposed to a game that feels like a reskin of AI War in certain respects.

The overall philosophy / gameplay loop also seems to remain the same, despite the difference in gameplay genre. You have to pick your fights and choose your targets, build yourself up and weaken the enemy enough to finally go in for the kill. Though, maybe this aspect is a little bit more different than AI War in a way that it's less extreme and less punishing.

Thankfully, the similarities seemed to end there, as the main gameplay is completely different than AI War, it's a turn-based tactical action roguelike that can stand on it's own, and it has it's own fun moments. 

Ironically, one of the other nitpicks I had with the game is something that is actually different from AI War games: the personification of the AI menace seems to be comically goofy in this game, as opposed to it's terrifying presence in the AI War series.

I also wished that each player controlled mech had it's own pilot with their own skills that improved with each battle, and that if a mech was destroyed in a battle, the pilot would die, so we would have to recruit a brand new pilot and his level would have to start from the beginning, just like how it was in Into The Breach. That way, the fact that the humans are more indispensible than the countless manufactured robots would have been more emphasized in this setting, I think. Also a single person being able to pilot 4 different mechs at the same time doesn't make as much sense.

My favorite part of the game is, picking and matching different equipment for the weapons of the mechs, that way I was able to turn a missile launcher into a nuke that obliterates an entire room, it's so much fun, lol. | For a $10 game, I think I got my money's worth. | These guys make some great games."
76561197999482693,238010,Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut,6.55,"Action, RPG",8,"This was my introduction to the Deus Ex series and overall I really enjoyed it. It reminds me most of Splinter Cell but slightly more action orientated, you often have the choice to stealth through areas or charge through guns blazing. I will say that because it has both options, neither are quite as good as games that focus on one or the other. The stealth is fun but not quite as complex as Splinter Cell or Thief e.g. While the shooting is good but not as good as a full FPS game.

But regardless the game is great, it's much longer than I expected but the story keeps you immersed and I really enjoyed the ending with some big moral/ethical choices. The voice acting, music and cinematic scenes are all great too.

I would say as a caveat, and this may not bother some people, but this game does show it's age. The textures are a bit ugly in places and the open environments can feel small, there's also a few annoyances like the map not always being clear, it often shows multiple markers even though you only have one quest/mission active and the sensitivity is super weird. There's also so much side lore and readable content in the game, too much in my opinion. But all of these are small things that, if you like stealth games or older games in general, shouldn't bother you. 

Overall I'd definitely recommend it to stealth/action fans, just be aware that this game is over 10 years old and does show it sometimes. | Pontos positivos:
- História e trilha sonora INCRÍVEIS
- Estética única e característica
- Roda em PC fraco
- Tem new game+
- Troféus bem feitos, te incentivam a jogar de novo e explorar mais o jogo
- Muito bom pra quem gosta de stealth e RPG
- Ótimas batalhas de diálogos com muita variedade e efeito borboleta
- Preço baixo em promoções
- Missões secundárias que aprofundam a história
- Múltiplos caminhos diferentes pra completar as missões
- Dá pra matar muita gente desgraçada

Pontos negativos:
- Não tem tradução nativa em português, tive que instalar externamente
- A gameplay pode ser difícil de se adaptar no início, mas é bem feita pra intuitos de furtividade. Tem tutoriais opcionais pra ajudar nisso.
- A DLC pode te desanimar de jogar por zerar seus aprimoramentos e ""desacelerar"" o ritmo do jogo, mas depois da primeira vez vai ficar mais tranquilo. Apesar disso, é um ponto crucial pra entender a história.
- Gosto das bossfights, mas não acho difíceis e nem desafiadoras (exceto a última)

OBS: a experiência é melhor jogando furtivamente, mas dá pra jogar trocando tiro também (é o que eu faço quando perco a paciência)
 | If you like The First Deus Ex you love this game as it plays similar to the first with changes but this is a game that is very important to us these days but the background of the game is very good and changes areas often

in terms of the gameplay most of it is fine besides the bad scope design and the bad health system and a lot of stats are mostly dump stats as you only need a pistol and grenades for most of the game maybe AR to deal with some hostiles and the grenade rifle to cheese a boss and there is annoying part that robs you of progress which is just bad design and not sure if you can work around that or not but overall its a solid game | good game. i got recommended this from a friend because I loved cyberpunk 2077.

Also it seems in Pacific Skies damage is linked to the difficulty whereas in Ace Patrol it isn't. this manifests in pacific skies as downing planes in a single attack vs having to make a few passes in Ace Patrol.

Game ran perfectly, despite being on modern hardware, and performed well... just seems to be one hell of a micro management game (which I typically enjoy) with tons of automation, partially or fully, which turn it into more of a macro game.

After putting more than 750 hours into this game over more than 10 years, I am finally ready to write a review.

This is it.  The space 4x strategy game that I keep coming back to among all the others.  I have played Stellaris, Sins of a Solar Empire, Masters of Orion, StarDrive, Endless Space, even space 4x games as far back as Spaceward Ho! and Stars!, which probably gives away my age.  I've even played through Distant Worlds 2 (though not since some major updates were made).  None of them keep me coming back time and again like Distant Worlds Universe.

The graphics are 2D, and fairly simple by today's standards. The UI is complex and often difficult to understand. The learning curve is very steep. Planet management is a bit lighter and less involved than other space 4X games. With such a huge barrier for new players, why then do I put it at my #1 spot? I have a lot of reasons.

Grand Scale: Galaxies can have up to 1500 stars, each with their own system of planets, asteroid fields, resources, ancient artifacts, ruins, and the occasional primitive civilization. Sprinkled between those stars are anomalies, space monsters, abandoned star bases, derelict ships (which you can repair or salvage for research), a rich history of a galactic war that happened centuries ago, and a looming threat of the return of a savage species.

Control Customization: You can take full control and micromanage every little detail throughout the game. Or, you can handle a single starship flying around the galaxy while the AI handles everything else in your empire. Or anything in between.

Heroes: Leader (one per faction), ship captains, fleet admirals, planet governors, scientists, spies, ambassadors. Each with their own set of perks and drawbacks.  Some scientists might be very skilled in one or more areas of research, but might also be a foreign spy, which gives other factions a much greater chance of stealing research from you.  A fleet admiral might be an excellent tactician, leading to greater targeting accuracy and damage, but might also be a drunkard, leading to slower hyper drive speed and greater ship maintenance costs.

Espionage: Distant Worlds Universe has the most involved, compelling, and choice-rich espionage system of any space 4X I've played.  Each mission requires that you send one of your hero spies (no nameless, disposable spies in this game!), and a mission failure is a very real loss--if your spy is captured, he's gone for good, along with all of the work you've put into carefully developing his skills.  And if your last spy is lost, then you are unable to perform any espionage missions until a new agent appears!

Ship Design:  I've seen many different ship designers in space 4x games.  Some are decent, some feel really dumbed-down (I'm looking at YOU, Endless Space!).  But Distant Worlds and StarDrive have by far my favorite ship design mechanics.  You can design a ship literally any way you want!  You can create a flying fuel cell with barely enough hull to protect the crew from the void of space, designed to speed out and scout distant areas while still making it back with any fuel to spare.  You can create colony ships with double capacity to give you a head-start in a new colony.  How about a missile boat that deliberately stays at long range to pelt enemies with a shower of long-range missiles?  (Yes, you can give each ship class specific directives on how to behave when encountering enemies.)

Design star bases, construction platforms, research facilities, resort hotels (yes, your people need entertainment too!), mining outposts, deep space observatories (for spying on enemy factions or getting early-warning notice when enemy fleets are inbound), and orbital defense platforms to help protect your colonies from surprise invasions.  Just like with ship design, base design is wide open as to what components you want to put into each base type.

Scientific Research:  There are three entirely different research sections: Weapons/Armor/Tactics, Energy/Construction, and High Tech/Science.  You can conduct one research project from each of them simultaneously.  The speed at which they are researched depends on the size of your population, along with the specific skills of your scientist heroes and how much research ""capacity"" you have constructed (in the form of research facilities).

Exploration:  With a vast galaxy, limited fuel, and warp speed requiring research before use, in the early game just exploring your own starting solar system is exciting, as you discover what resources are available and try to find that oh-so-elusive ""warp field precursors"" data left on one of your system's planets by the few survivors of a centuries-old galactic war.  Early research advancements in fuel capacity, engine thrust, and directional thrust are critical in how efficiently you explore and exploit the resources available in your home system.  By the time you are ready to leave the cradle and travel to nearby stars, exploration starts all over again with your first barely warp-capable scouts travelling and discovering critical fuel-resources in order to extend your empire's reach.  In fact, exploration is viable and fun throughout the early- and mid-game, and by the time you hit end-game, your scout ships' purposes shift to being deep-space scanners to be able to see through the fog of war.

I could go on: Race variety. Diplomacy. Resource mining/management. Planet-destroying super weapons. Fuel management. Race-unique win conditions.

This game is a dream for those who love this genre.  Buy this game.  Have the patience and courage to get past the obtuse user interface and complex game mechanics, and you will find a gem of a game where I, after more than a decade of play later, am still learning new things. | game does not launhc on windows 11, tried lots of supposed fixes

76561197999482693,214910,Air Conflicts: Pacific Carriers,0.0,"Action, Simulation",0,"Air Conflicts: Pacific is a remarkable game that defies categorization as a traditional flight simulator; instead, it strikes a balance between simulation and arcade elements. The campaign is engaging, and the gameplay is enjoyable. One of the standout features is the ability to Control a full squadron and to load planes and launch from carriers, as well as land on them. Furthermore, players are tasked with various responsibilities beyond flying, including using binoculars to identify abnormalities and locate Japanese fleets. The game successfully places the player in the role of an aircraft carrier captain in the Pacific. Despite being an older game that may have gone unnoticed, it remains a delightful experience, and I hope to see future adaptations, possibly exploring the Guanal Canal or the Marianas turkey shoot. I strongly recommend this game, which, although not a traditional flight simulator, offers a unique blend of arcade and simulation elements, allowing players to adjust the level of realism and tailor their experience.
7.5/10 | Air Conflicts: Pacific Carriers разочаровывает на многих уровнях. Несмотря на многообещающее название и задумку, игра не оправдывает ожиданий, которые могли возникнуть у поклонников авиасимуляторов. Графика выглядит устаревшей и порой даже неаккуратно выполненной — текстуры местами размазаны, а анимация моделей самолетов не впечатляет. 

Управление ощущается неестественно, что значительно усложняет процесс игры. Непродуманная система использования оборудования и отсутствие должных инструкций лишь усиливают путаницу. ИИ противников часто ведет себя нелогично, что приводит к абсурдным ситуациям в бою.

Кроме того, сюжетная составляющая оставляет желать лучшего. Миссии быстро становятся однообразными, и отсутствие креативного подхода приводит к скуке. Мультиплеер тоже не радует — он полон багов и нестабильности, что уничтожает возможность комфортной игры с друзьями. 

В целом, Air Conflicts: Pacific Carriers — это игра, которая могла бы стать интересной, но, к сожалению, потерпела неудачу из-за множества недоработок и устаревшего подхода к игровому процессу. | Macht Laune und hält an historischen Ereignissen fest | options | Na 2 missão o tecoteco não voa"

Você passa um bom tempo jogando como se ele fosse um jogo qualquer, quando na verdade o rumo que se deve ter é completamente diferente. Darkest Dungeon é uma das minhas experiências mais difíceis que eu tive nos últimos anos com jogos. A jogabilidade é extremamente punitiva, nociva caso não saiba o que está fazendo. Um dos núcleos do jogo, é o dinheiro. É necessário entrar nas missões (dungeons), se importar com fazer dinheiro, sua sobrevivência e ainda completar o seu objetivo. Conciliar todos esses fatores, transforma a experiência em um ciclo maçante de fazer dinheiro e upar personagens para o final do jogo. Penso que essa ferramenta utilizada para ser a ponte principal do Darkest Dungeon, pode ser bem mal vista para quem pensa em zerar o jogo.

Mas, além de tudo, gostaria de enaltecer a arte característica e virtuosa, que transmite perfeitamente a atmosfera obscura das dungeons, da sofrência e do medo. A direção artística voltada ao tema ""Lovecrafteana"", é muito bem feito, principalmente no que se diz progressão visual. Os ambientes se tornando mais medonhas cada vez que você vai progredindo para o final do jogo, a mudança de cores voltadas ao cosmo e carnificina ou até mesmo as músicas que passam de um violino arranhado e agitado para algo mais ""contemplador""

Por fim, vai minha dica:
- Se você quiser uma experiência menos massiva, jogue na dificuldade Radiante
- Caso queira sofrer um pouco mais, tendo que repetir missões para ficar mais forte, jogue na Mais Escura
- E se você for um mutante, jogue na mais difícil mesmo, é uma experiência semelhante a estar em um quarto branco com camisa de força no corpo | 新手上手不难，甚至比月计还简单一些，风格也熟悉，各位主管，司书，管理员必入 | This is a game I played on an off for years, and both loved it and grew frustrated by it as I played.  This last year I decided it was time to beat the game finally, so I dedicated a bit more of my gaming time to it, and feel I can give some fairly informed thoughts on the game.  

Darkest Dungeon has a fun party management system that is well designed and the heart and soul of the game.  Do you select your ranged skills for your Highwayman so he can be in position 3?  Or do you take his pos 1/2 skills and play more of a high risk high reward style of play up front?  Do you put your jester in the back making him a buffing character?  Or do you put him further forward so you can apply bleed and be more of a DPS character?  It allows you to make a lot of different parties in different ways, and as you play you learn what combo's works best for each situation, and which ones you prefer to play.  

The enemies also have positions that work differently for each enemy type, and some of your characters will let you manipulate the positions of your enemies to mess them up or put them in a position for one of your other characters to pummel them into the dirt.   So overall the game play is EXCELLENT.

Where I had my struggles with the game was losing characters.  When I first started playing the game it really hurt to lose that Leper that I had been using effectively for so many dives into the dungeon.  I eventually learned that dying is an important aspect of the game, and if you upgrade your stagecoach you will be just fine.  The death of the characters also adds weight to your decisions in the game.  If you decide to get too crazy with a party/skill composition there is a very real chance you are going to lose some of your characters.  So if you decide to play Darkest dungeon just accept right off the bat that death is part of the grim dark theme of the game.

The other aspect of the game that people may not like is the tone and atmosphere of the game.  It is a grim dark themed horror game.  Horror is not really my jam to be honest, but the game play and how the theme is executed, and the great narration of the game drew me in despite my lack of interest in the horror genre.  

Overall the game play is excellent, and the setting, style and art of the game is unique and intriguing.  I would highly recommend this to people looking for a great rogue like dungeon crawler that stands out in an over crowded market."

I thoroughly enjoyed AOW2 as well growing up with my dad and brother. And for AOW3 thank goodness it had a bit of a story mode too. Not that I needed an expansive one, but it really helped me learn the nuances of the game (which is why I just couldn't get into AOW4 due to their LACK of any story mode). 

The only area I felt was missing was what I thought were upcoming DLC's (Shadow Realms, Archons and more) but they never came. But luckily there is a thriving mod community that more than exceeded my expectations for this itch. | It doesn't have the atmosphere of first game or great magic system of the second, but it's still pretty good game with a lot of options, I wish I could say the same about the sequel. | 游戏性个人觉得不如前作，但也不错了 | This game has a lot of good.

76561197999482693,259060,Dominions 4: Thrones of Ascension,38.166666666666664,"Indie, Strategy",0,"Just way too complicated for me - this game has gathered dust in my library for years because every time I've tried to play it I've just landed up scratching my head trying to understand what is going on - even a tutorial video on YouTube took like an hour just to get past some of the starting options, before even really getting into any game play.

Not helped by the fact that there doesn't seem to be a proper inbuilt tutorial (well there is in theory, but it directs me towards reading the manual and there is no on-screen help or tips that I can see). I like inbuilt tutorials because surely the people who developed the game should be best placed to tell us about all the mechanics and what is important, and if they don't see making the game comprehensible as being important then I'm kinda wondering why.

Within the game I just feel like there is too much stuff - do you want your pretender to be a dragon or a tree, what types of unit (of the many many types on offer) do you want to build, keeping in mind that they all have quite complicated stats and features, and it's not clear to me at all where I get things like research from etc - like I just don't understand at all the decisions I'm supposed to be making and I assume the only way to properly understand is to spend many many hours on Youtube tutorials and playing the game through repeatedly. I think that one thing which I feel makes it harder as a beginner is that many of these decisions feel quite drastic - i.e. having a large potential impact - it's not like choosing a civ which will be slightly better at tech, or slightly better with military, some of these feel like very fundamental and major choices and I don't really understand them or their potential impact later in the game at all.

I appreciate some people will read this and think I'm just lazy for not putting in more time to understand it properly but the simple reality is that I don't have the time or energy to understand something this complicated where the developers haven't really (in my view) made a bit more effort to ease me into it, with a proper tutorial and maybe a more user-friendly interface / hints, and some efforts to help me understand what the realistic impact of different decisions might be. I've played plenty of strategy games with various levels of complexity but for me this is complicated past the point where I feel like I will enjoy overall spending the time required to understand it. I have lot of other games in my library which I've played more (many of them cheaper than this one) because they are fairly easy to get into and have a good tutorial to get started, and I have a job where I'm expected to explain what I've done to customers rather than just sending them something overcomplicated and expecting them to work for hours to figure it out. So I just don't really see a good argument as to why this game couldn't be a bit more user friendly.

p.s. I am not whingeing about the graphics here, I would still pick up Civ 2 and play it very happily if I had a copy right now I just think this game is too complicated for me to get into and the interface / lack of a proper tutorial doesn't help. | I simply don't get it. You'll be doing fine keeping up constantly against a computer opponent then BAM, they drop 860 troops. I finally had one going fine and had half the board secure and steadily advancing then BAM, I stormed a castle after 6 rounds of siege and my entire board was wiped out. My God was secure and all the way in the back portion of the map so not in anyway vulnerable. Just YOU LOSE! The enemy didn't have even 100 troops near my location I was attacking and I had close to 1000. Makes no sense but won't ever involve any time in this game again. 

It's an interesting game but just as soon as you are getting ahead the computer opponents 

Lucky I got this game for around $5 but I would not suggest even paying that whenever they run a special. | Thought about it and wish I could recommend this game but it's literally micro-management hell. Was thinking about how many campaigns I started and realized I never really completed any of them. The gameplay loop isn't fun, it's more tedious than anything. Playing around with all the units and all the different pretender gods is really fun but doesn't make up for the gameplay. | Go play Dominions 6 if you can afford it. | UI is like total nonsense ... I cannot imagine that so many ppl liked that game..."
76561197999482693,268130,Heat Signature,2.3333333333333335,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Strategy",12,"A lot of games that are heavily based around systems and emergent gameplay fall somewhat flat for me because doing things in wacky ways feels somewhat pointless beyond ""lol you can just drop a big rock on the enemies"" or whatever.

Heat Signature is a case of a game in which the standard stuff that you get shown in the tutorial is and lots of fun by itself (it's hotline miami by way of FTL) but the act of exploiting the game's systems is also both intuitive and wildly effective. The game really clicks when you get on a big ship to assassinate someone, see the 40 people with shields between you and them, and decide instead to go hijack a different ship alltogether to shoot some holes into the former so you can dock right next to your target. Despite the relatively simplistic designs of the procedurally generated ships, there's tons of variety from mission to mission, and I keep discovering new things despite the fact that the game doesn't actually unlock much and progression is just new mission types or getting to buy certain item types instead of having to find them.

Anyway, it's lots of fun, you should play it. | It's good as far as what you get from it. The game progresses by getting more high end gadgets that let you take on enemies who will be invincible otherwise. You can generally classic stealth to a point but enemy contractors will make you play more seat of your pants. There's a few types of missions, and the enjoyment of the game is from going in to a hard mission and trying to win.

Balancing your inventory between weapons and gadgets is part of the game. You pick up a lot of stuff and you need to use it to win.

Understand that this is not a progression quest, the end game isn't that great and if you aren't enjoying it you should stop playing. The actual payoff is the defector missions where you get a bit of cool equipment and try to do a hard mission. i.e, the reward for playing the game is playing the game. | Un exellent jeu au gameplay très riche permettant tout type d'approches aux missions. J'y reviens encore des années plus tard tant le jeu est prenant | i VERY much like this game, its just lots of fun, even going for high scores is very fun, its about tricks and strategy timing it is easier tho (with that slowmo) | Maybe the most underrated game I own.

76561197999482693,249050,Dungeon of the ENDLESS™,45.65,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",8,"I came back to this game after not playing for many years because of fond memories of the unique mechanics and the strategy.  I cant think of another game quite like this. 

I really enjoyed the problem solving, and scenario planning aspect of the game.  It is a ton of fun to play, once you figure it out, and this is where this game falls down, in guiding new players.  

I would highly recommend new players to not shun character guides and other online resources to get going.  This is a ten year old game and I think they purposefully designed the game around ""discovery"" mechanics (especially around character skill progression and item effects) so you learn by doing,  Which I think would be fine if you unlocked something that documented the information for you so if you step away for a few weeks you don't forget.  I find myself wasting resources to ""find out"" what something does only to have forgotten even later in the play through. 

Personally I think if this game underwent a UX/UI cleanup, slightly better tutorialization of some of the mechanics and better information persistance you could re-release this game today and it would attract a huge following. | OK game. Would be awesome without the following two issues. First, the game occasionally CTDs between floors and deletes the autosave (the only allowed save) in the process - so game over. Secondly, large monster waves are a big blob of moving pixels. It is almost impossible to tell which monsters and how many are attacking your heroes. Looks ugly too. I do not get why people like pixel art in this game. Pixel art was not a choice but a necessity back in the day. The best old pixel art (e.g. Prince of Persia, Lemmings) also looked way better than this hot mess. | Addictive, good looking, funny, rogue type game that makes you utilize brain and try it in different play modes.

9/10

Cons - sometimes it is too dependent on random elements. | Simply one of my favorite games of all time. DoTE is a fun little tower defense that can be played solo or with a group (up to four players.) There is quite a few characters to unlock with their own unique play styles and abilities. The difficulty levels are a bit of satire “easy” is quite damn hard, it’s extremely challenging to finish the dungeon. Where as “too easy” is well, just that after you get the hang of things, still a fairly good challenge starting out and later on with the different launch pods you unlock after successful playthroughs. FIDS resources are the same as other endless games. If you enjoy resource management and tower defense you should love this. | Не цікава, не весела, цілком порожня гра із високим порогом входження.

Aside from the needless complexity of 3D navigation the user interface scaling is super weir. Icons are massive and the text is tiny and difficult to real. The layout of icons and scaling feels like this was intended to be a phone game and it really doesn't work on PC. For instance in the previous game I could have the inventory, and trade interface open at the same time but you have to click back and forth many times to navigate menus which is the opposite of the design principals of previous games. Also the survey scans are so bad, they blink over the entire screen in waves and combined with the super saturated colors its difficult to look at for any length of time."

But I was not prepared for how absolutely insane it actually is. I'm not a stranger to hack-and-slash games, but this just next level of chaotic. Yeah the story is a bit short, and the gameplay is a little simple, but the learning curve and skill ceiling and crazy. Easily one of my favorite games of all time.

Plus, the soundtrack is absolutely God tier. | Metal Gear Rising ironically used Memes effectively to make sure it would live on forever. Truly rising to beyond human level of entertainment and ascending to MEME-like omnipresence!"
76561197999482693,300550,Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut,2.1,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",1,"I've tried starting this game multiple times but every time is has managed to lose my interest.
There's really nothing special about the two main parts of the game being combat and the story.

Only time where I really enjoyed playing is one section with multiple extended combat encounters where I had to plan out a strategy and ration my consumable items. Not sure if it was scripted or a random chance on doing a mission but I ended up getting a surprise combat after I believed everything was finished.

The hacking ""decking"" mechanic is a complete waste of time and consists of even worse combat just to use cameras for vision where it doesn't matter or turrets in areas where no enemies go. It also uses turns in combat so you're missing a fourth party member just to do it.
The Shaman class is one that I want to like but can't because of your summons have a chance to escape and turn on you every turn with increasing chances. I love the idea of support classes in general, but even its haste buff feels underwhelming. The range on the starting Shaman NPC's damage reduction aoe is also so short that there's no point in using it. 

The story isn't great either. A good majority of your supporting characters either do not like you or do not trust you which leads you to pry scraps and pieces of information from them over time. You're also mostly doing a bunch of disjointed side missions ranging from mildly interesting to a waste of time that makes you dislike your party members even more because they disapproved of you doing the morally right thing or doing anything risky. All of this is sometimes broken up by story exposition that goes on for too long and does not result in anything except your team's information broker saying that he'll look into it. | A good CRPG for its modest budget. Liked the companions and the main story while taking some predictable turns remained enjoyable for the most part, seems like there is a decent variety of outcomes, will probably replay it with couple more builds to see how things play out with different choices and I want to see what passing some skillchecks does, unlike modern CRPGs you can't use party members to pass them, gotta do most of them yourself. There is definitely an intent for you to play some specific builds like INT with high biotech skill. Can't say for sure that all build options are equally interesting and rewarding but a rather simpleminded ""All points in Quickness"" basic gunslinger with just enough Charisma to get two etiquettes: corporate and shadowrunner, still was satisfying on the first playthrough. Just don't take Socialite, seen like one etiquette check involving it through the whole game and it was just for a bit extra money, stick to something like Security or Academic instead.

On an additional note, I couldn't help finding the epilogue of the main story a bit underwhelming. You make the final choice, go back to your home, talk about it with your crew and then get a bit of extra context on what transpired and what's gonna happen from couple very important (in a setting, not narrative, that is) NPCs before getting a text epilogue that tells about the several events in the future, some of them probably an outcome of your decisions throughout the game. And that's it. I guess the underwhelming part is a natural outcome of the narrative framing, you get dragged into this deadly grand mystery and resolving it is the only way to survive but you don't really have any other motivation, at best to avenge an NPC who dies in the prologue and another NPC who dies in the middle of the game. So while your involvement is narratively justified, the personal stakes you and your companions have don't feel interesting?  No matter how well you furnish it with dialogues ""Phew, that was quite something. Glad we survived. What do we do now?"" is still something lacking oomph, at least for me. | DragonFall Nails it.

From the tone of the world, to the depth and nuance of the characters you encounter the writing in this game walks the line of ""in world"" conversations while not verging into the valley of cringe that is easy to slip into. 

This entry has just enough beats to satisfy, challenging fun combat and options to make it your own.  

this is an instant key entry to the genre. I will be stealing characters and setting elements for my live game | Loved this. I slept on the SR series for years, picked this up mostly for research, and found a lot of unexpectedly interesting design and narrative decisions. It's hard to pick one thing that SR:DF does unusually well, but the ambience, systems, narrative, writing, art never fall below 'very good' and they work together harmoniously. And of course it's really faithful to the original IP if you were there for that in the early TRPG days, so if you're here for nostalgia, fill yer boots.

- в миссиях, где надо прослушать все диалоги, в один момент НПС могут встать на месте и просто молчать пару игровых часов, а потом разойтись, так ничего и не сказав друг другу;
- различные софтлоки, к примеру, в миссиях, где цель прилетает на вертолете, может получиться так, что вертолет прилетит, а цель из него выходить не будет или же, где по условию задания, в конце миссии надо эвакуировать [u] три [/u] танка, но появляется только [u] два [/u] ;
- враги подрываются на собственных минах, а если трупы найдут их же товарищи, то поднимется тревога.

Все бы ничего если бы, во второй половине игры, не надо было проходить, еще раз часть ТЕХ ЖЕ ПРОШЛЫХ МИССИЙ, но с ПОВЫШЕННОЙ СЛОЖНОСТЬЮ, это портит полностью впечатление от игры под ее конец.

Также в игре, много лишнего и ненужного, я всю игру пробегал с одним и тем же автоматом и с одной и той же винтовкой, изредка меняя винтовку на ракетницу. У меня ни разу не появилась такая игровая ситуация, где мне понадобилось использовать дробовик, пулемет, гранатомет или щит. Та же история с напарниками, способность пса - отмечать врагов в радиусе 100 метров, полностью перекрывает необходимость использовать других напарников. 

Или же вот, дикие животные - вроде хорошая идея, чтобы окружающий мир был более живым, но такое чувство что эту задумку бросили на пол пути и так добавили в игру, потому что части животных в игровом мире вообще нет. И таких довольно крупных особей, как каракал, медоед, лисица и т.д., надо ловить через специальную ловушку, которая размером со ступу Снейка. Почему я должен ловить лису, которой в открытом мире даже не существует, в маленькую клетку, хотя я спокойно могу найти на локации мышь или ежа? Почему бы не добавить одну лису на весь Афганистан и ходи ее и ищи, так было бы намного интереснее, чем сейчас есть в игре.

Спасибо за существование пулемета на вертолете, которым я ни разу не воспользовался, кроме одной миссии, где надо было сюжетно пострелять по-местному евангелиону, но зато в каждый второй миссии об этот пулемет зацепляешься, при попытке спрыгнуть с вертолета, и надо подождать проигрывание анимации доставания и сворачивание этого пулемета.

[h1] Сюжет (10/10) [/h1]
За историей интересно следить, интересно слушать аудиокассеты, а главные и второстепенные герои чувствуются живыми и настоящими. Серьезность игры, в моментах разбавляется японским юмором, в хорошем смысле.

[h1] Графика/анимации и музыка (9/10) [/h1]
Вопросов к графике и анимации - нет, даже сейчас все смотрится довольно красиво и свежо. Что нельзя сказать про музыку, за 120 часов игры, я не могу вспомнить ни один саундтрек, что он есть, что его нет, слух не режет и на том хорошо.

[h1] Заключение [/h1]
Всем советую поиграть в эту замечательную игру. Цена полностью соответствует, тому наслаждению и досугу, что вы получите при прохождении, а если еще и по скидке, то тем более. | I owned this game on release on PS3. It was among the first games I owned on PS4. And, when I got a laptop in college meant for editing and rendering high definition video, I got this game again. And each time I got it, I completed the game start to finish, completing all missions and side missions. 

While obviously, the game wasn't finished and chapter 2 is just a mess, this is by far one of the best action stealth games you can ever purchase. | [h1] Great game [/h1]
I really enjoyed kidnapping people and forcing them to work for me. Also I'm not entirely sure but i think Hideo Kojima worked on this game, they should add more credits. | Kojima is genius
This game is epic

Pros:
-Good gameplay mechanics and I really like the stealth in this game (ignore the fact that sometimes enemies are very stupid and blind)
-""Depressing"" but cool plot
-Some jokes and funny tricks in the game
-Grinding isn't always a good thing, but for some reason I liked it in this game.
-You need to build your own base and improve your people. I didn't expect that in a stealth game, but it's cool.
-lots of interactivity
-D-Doge
-Quiet provides too much fanservice (couldn't help but mention this)

Cons:
-You can't have sex with Quiet
-Dumb and unnecessary multiplayer components

9.5/10 | One of Kojima's finest, and misunderstood masterpieces.

The FOX engine provides one of the smoothest and crisp gameplays you'll ever receive out of the Tactical Stealth Espionage genre, with satisfying movement, gunplay, and graphics that still hold up in 2025.

The Story:

The story is one of the most misunderstood parts of the game, and this is largely due to people either not being well-versed in Metal Gear lore, or simply lack story comprehension, which in this game, is told a lot more differently compared to previous titles.

Instead of CODEC calls, most of the conversations that are important to the story are contained in cassettes, which you have the option of listening to. I believe this to be something that Kojima implemented, as a means to not cause people to complain or be bored if these were done as CODEC calls, because there is a LOT of conversations, way too many to fit into CODEC's. 

The story is crushing, it is a representation of veiling evil as ""good"", with pursuit against ""evil"" being an act of revenge, veiled as ""justice"". 

[SPOILER] 

The biggest part of this ""good"" veiling as ""evil"" is the way the real Big Boss turns his most trusted lieutenant to be a phantom of himself, to uphold Diamond Dogs while he works in secrecy to develop his own plans. He uses his phantom the same way the US government used Big Boss in the end of Metal Gear 3, a pawn for a bigger picture in the war economy.

Metal Gear Solid V is more than a game, it's a message, which has stood the path of time for 10 years, in being the quality that all games should look up to being like."
76561197999482693,290300,Rebel Galaxy,20.3,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation",15,"It's a very nice little game.

The story itself is short, but the corner of the galaxy you're in has its charm, with well voice acted character, excellent soundtracks (which you can customize. Personally I went with Cowboy Bebop), and very beautiful graphics that renders space and spaceships spectacularly well.

Where Rebel Galaxy truly shines is its gameplay loop. It is basically a progression to the top, looking for better guns to put on bigger ships with thicker shields. The progression isn't all vertical though.
I had much fun getting right behind bigger ships with my more manoeuvrable corvettes and drilling their hull where they couldn't blast me. Or escaping swarms of fighters, only to slow down a bit and snipe a few before fleeing again.
Additionally, while it wasn't my desire, you can very well roleplay as a more civilian entrepreneur, mining and trading enormous hauls to sell where the market is best. Combat is still very much an important factor, but you don't need to be a military dreadnought to roll over would be pirates.

So skill and style of gameplay have their place.

Piloting a ship can be a bit strange at first, but the game ease you into it. It is on a 2d map, meaning you'll never have to manage the verticality, except for some fighters who fly all over the place, but automated turrets knows how to reach them.

As for the difficulty, do not worry too much. If you reach the limit of your skill, the game rewards patience and diligence. Do some missions, earn your money on a more manageable system, and then buy yourself a better equipment. It will make all the difference. By the end, I had the biggest ship fully upgraded, a flat death star, and only in the most dire situation did I need to manoeuvre a bit. Otherwise, I just had to be there, and rotate a bit for everything to explode around.
If you do missions though, nI recommend not taking any escort missions. The AI can be frustrating on several levels.

Finally, the story.
It is short, but sweet. I was really hoping the end wasn't the end, the story of this weird chasing of mysterious artefacts with half the badlands gunning for us made me smile. I grew attached to the characters introduced (that I didn't kill for being double-crossing pyjacks), and I can only wish there would be more of them.
But it is just an adventure, with its heights, its doubts, its dangers, and in the end, its goodbyes.

All in all, a good game for a few hours of fun. And perhaps to return to once in a while. | This game suddenly will not work in windows 10 steam execute error was not an original steam game i am going to get it from the original site | Great game.

I really really want to say I like this game but it can't even explain or properly implement its difficulty system. Massive bummer."

As mecânicas são legais e sinto que faltou a comunidade engajar no jogo (poderia ter sido um jogaço, mas pouca gente jogava online). Achei a história meio aleatória demais também. 

Se estiver barato, pode comprar que você vai se divertir. | Demorei anos para fazer uma análise de Pit People, mas finalmente posso dizer: que jogo incrível! Ele é absurdamente divertido, com um nível de entretenimento que rivaliza com seu humor ácido e sarcástico. Claro, algumas das piadas mais ousadas poderiam facilmente ser barradas por certas ""consultorias"" por aí, que adoram decidir o que é ou não adequado para o público — mas quem se importa, né?

Ainda assim, Pit People é uma experiência única. Além de ser incrivelmente divertido, apresenta uma narrativa maravilinda (sim, essa palavra descreve perfeitamente!). Mas o verdadeiro destaque, o suprassumo da obra, é seu design visual: grotesco e, ao mesmo tempo, fascinante. É como observar o ápice da loucura embalado por um humor ácido e refinado.

Se você busca algo único, memorável e com aquele toque de irreverência que pode deixar algumas “consultorias” incomodadas, esse jogo é uma explosão de criatividade e diversão! | Um jogo simples de estratégia, não há muito que dizer. Tem alguma piada, a história é boa, estando dentro dos padrões dos criadores. Se gostam de jogos feitos por estes tipos recomendo comprarem este. | Apparently there is 200+ hours of content in this game but the story alone is worth the 20$ (Especially if you  played Battleblock). | Yes there is 300 hours worth of content in this game, and it's still funny the whole time. Best Behemoth game and I mean it (as long as you like turned based games)"
76561197999482693,294860,Valkyria Chronicles™,0.0,"Action, RPG, Strategy",0," Strange game this like, 3rd person XCOM, real time reaction fire from your own troops and enemies gives a more immersive feel. Tactics are varied but sadly the game seem to awards you more for bumrushing than taking a more clinical approach. Still you can play it however you feel and story is compelling enough to keep it moving, and being moving in places too.

 All of this underscored with a beautiful soundtrack and aesthetic it's worth giving a try. I strongly recommend bashing your head against a wall first time through and finding ways to a rank and seeing what secrets (Enemy Aces and hidden recruits) you can uncover then using what you learned to smash it on new game plus.

 Only real problems I can think of are a few missions where ambushes are lobbed on you via trigger points you had no way of knowing existed. Some of the mechanics in a couple missions are poorly/timed obscurely too. But this only happens a couple of times throughout and you can generally save yourself from any of these situations. | VERY GOOD GAME, JANE OP. 
wish the missions were better designed tho. Lot of the missions require constant save scumming just cause they are not explained properly. | The content of the game is actually really good, but the game crashes when I switch from ‘headquartes’ to ‘book mode’.
Which causes progress to be lost as the game has no form of auto-save.
This wouldn't actually be a big problem, or so I thought.
However, I'm not the only one who has this problem with the game
and in fact this problem seems to have existed for years. 
It's a real shame, but I don't want to support a product that requires the player to solve problems that should actually be solved by the developers. | Les miches d'Alicia miam miam.

Bon le jeu est incroyable, tout est exceptionnel, c'est une pépite. | I love Valkyria Chronicles series, because I grew up with it. I love the stories and unique combat system. Of course it's too much grinding for EXP and DCT. If I got money and discount, I'll buy the fourth game. It is deeply regretted because second and third game is PSP exclusive. If SEGA had plan, please release the second and third game to Steam. I'll love it to wishlist it and buy it for my childhood memories and nostalgia."

Há formas de concertar, mas ainda sim pode ser incomodo.

O jogo é o hack'n'slash bem maneirinho e realmente estiloso e divertido, com uma história interessante, mas leve em conta que pode ter problemas com o port. | Buyer beware on this recommendation. By default this game runs at 1080p, 30 fps max. It is possible to exceed these limits by making some simple changes to text files in the game directory, but doing so comes with caveats. See the PC Gaming Wiki page for this game for details. I was able to play through it well enough at 1440p, 90fps and didn't encounter anything game breaking. It looked and played amazingly at these settings.

Technical issues aside, I really enjoyed this game. Killer 7 is one of my favorite games of all time, but I did not like No More Heroes. This game feels like a compromise between the two, offering a lot of that Killer 7 style and flare with tighter action gameplay and a more concise design than No More Heroes. I cannot state enough how much I love the unique weirdness of Grasshopper's artwork and this game has a ton of it.

I played on Hard which was just about perfect. Not too easy and not too frustrating. The game's length and progression are limited with a small list of upgradable character attributes, but overall this is probably a positive thing because it keeps the game from overstaying its welcome. | Historia 10/10: Somos un asesino llamado mondo que trabaja de manera secreta para el gobierno en el cual un día despertó con un brazo mecánico sin saber como lo llego a tener sufrimos pesadillas y recuerdos de nuestro pasado. 

Música: 10/10: Obra maestra de rola.

Gráficos 10/ 10: Me gusto el estilo de arte.

Jugabilidad 9/10: Podemos mejorar nuestras habilidades, cambiar de traje, esquivar ataques, bloquear ataques, romper la defensa de enemigos, hacer desafíos, golpes meles, combos de ataques especiales, coquetear y dar regalos a chicas, disparar con nuestro brazo mecánico, ralentizar el tiempo si esquivas de forma perfecta los ataques.

Optimización del juego 0/10: Te va como el forro el juego aunque tengas pc potente o pc de la nasa. Tengas alta memoria ram o de la nasa.

Lo bueno: Es entretenida su dinámica de combate agresivo rápido y bloqueos. Momentos de joda ecchi y humor.

Lo malo:  El juego tiene muchos bugs técnicos que lo hace casi injugable estos son los problemas como un port mal hecho el juego original igual tenia problemas, el autoguardado del juego muchas veces funciona mal y te deja en espera tocandote cerrar el juego y volver a hacer la misión desde cero, la pantalla negra, bajones de fps, crasheos raros, hay baja resolución de pantalla y pocas opciones de ajuste de visualización, hay música que en la versión original estaba y en esta versión no esta, los personajes tienen poca profundidad osea son pocos con los cuales puedes empatizar, cuando te stunean los enemigos es jodido recuperarse porque mondo tarda mucho en recuperarse, hay combos pero no hay combos aereos, en la batalla contra David pasa que debes presionar como loco casi a romper tus dedos o tu mouse para pasar a la siguiente fase porque pide exageradamente que presiones el boton de ataque de manera que podrias lastimar tus dedos o malograr tu mouse solo pasa en el primer 1 y 2 enfrentamiento contra David en el tercero no pasa, algunos logros estan bugeados, puedes tener citas con chicas pero no puedes dedicarte a una si quieres todas las armas claro esta, las chicas te tratan como un desconocido en todas las citas y mondo es un gigolo osea si quieres más armas especiales en el juego debes de ser toda un prota de harem solo queria poncharme a una nomás y además no tienen mucha profundidad de personaje las chicas, hay contenido sexo hetero pero es leve porque es discreto y no lo muestran directamente. Puedes jugar con los requisitos minimos pero el port del juego esta tan mal hecho que te recomiendo que apuntes a los requisitos más alla del recomendado este juego va como el forro incluso si tienes un pc potente.

Conclusión: No recomiendo este juego por los muchos problemas técnicos que tiene ya que hicieron un mal port :c. | Absolutely abysmal port. Frequent crashes and bugs. Save your money. | Juego excelente, port malísimo, lo logré pasar sin problemas la primera vez (Suerte, supongo) pero cuando volví a instalarlo para tratar de hacerme el 100% (así de mucho me encantó el juego) empezaron los crasheos de los que todo el mundo habla. Una pena, porque los juegos del Suda51 merecen muchísimo más reconocimiento, pero que un mal port que se crashea cada dos por tres sea la única forma de jugarlo es genuinamente decepcionante y un insulto al consumidor. Ojalá algún día poder volver aquí y cambiar mi reseña por una positiva, así sea por un parche de la comunidad."

Игру получил за 100 рублей, советую с друзьями играть. | Great game where you can kill people as brutally as possible but lacks online co-op. | Road Redemption é um jogo excelente para quem busca uma combinação de ação frenética, corrida e combate. Inspirado no clássico Road Rash, o jogo moderniza a fórmula ao adicionar mecânicas mais profundas, gráficos atualizados e uma dose de caos que mantém a adrenalina alta do início ao fim.

Jogabilidade

A essência de Road Redemption está em seu gameplay viciante. O jogador assume o controle de um motociclista em uma gangue, enfrentando adversários em pistas cheias de desafios. O combate corpo a corpo é o destaque, permitindo o uso de armas como tacos, espadas, correntes e até armas de fogo. A física do jogo é satisfatória, e o impacto dos golpes torna cada corrida imprevisível e emocionante.

Além disso, o jogo conta com elementos de progressão, como upgrades para o personagem e a moto, o que incentiva o jogador a continuar avançando. A dificuldade é balanceada, mas pode ser desafiadora em alguns momentos, especialmente em níveis mais avançados.

Gráficos e Som

Embora os gráficos não sejam ultra-realistas, eles cumprem bem seu papel. O estilo visual é estilizado, com cenários variados que incluem desertos, cidades e rodovias perigosas. A trilha sonora é outro ponto forte, com músicas intensas que combinam perfeitamente com o clima de ação e velocidade.

Modo Multiplayer

O modo multiplayer é uma adição divertida, permitindo que você enfrente amigos ou outros jogadores online. A competição é ainda mais intensa, e o caos aumenta com a presença de oponentes humanos, tornando cada corrida uma experiência única.

Pontos a melhorar

Apesar de suas qualidades, Road Redemption não é perfeito. O sistema de colisão pode ser inconsistente em alguns momentos, e a câmera às vezes dificulta a visão durante manobras mais complexas. Além disso, o jogo pode parecer repetitivo após longas sessões, especialmente para quem busca variedade nas missões.

Conclusão

Road Redemption é uma ótima escolha para quem gosta de jogos de corrida com um toque de violência e adrenalina. Ele consegue capturar a essência de seu predecessor espiritual enquanto traz novidades suficientes para se destacar por conta própria. Se você procura um jogo divertido e desafiador para jogar sozinho ou com amigos, Road Redemption é uma aposta certeira.

 | Maybe I just remember Road Rash being better than it actually was. I played the hell out of that game. I think for me the problem is in the gameplay loop. It didn't ""feel"" like a death race. It kept throwing odd ""missions"" at me that didn't really fit the theme. Having to take out a gang leader is one thing, but having to kill X amount of a group, or perform X maneuver so many times took it out of being a fight for survival and just made it a stereotypical arcade button basher. The ""race"" felt like an afterthought. And if you expect a sort of proper physics, forget about it. I purchased this when it was on sale for 2.99 and still refunded it. I just had no desire to keep it. | It's a good single player game, multiplayer could use some work tho. Couldn't find a game."

Уявіть собі, живуть вони в підземеллях московського метро, наче щури, бояться вийти на поверхню, радіація і мутанти як величезні бабайки цього світу. Але, давайте чесно, хіба не самі росіяни стали для себе найбільшою загрозою та ворогом, що звик знищувати собі подібних, заново винайшовши фанатизм, диктаторські режими, рабовласницький стрій, та любов до засекречення усього. А в результаті, як виявилося, людянішими та кращими персонажами за всіх, є мутанти, що розвинутіші, розумніші, що не доведено, бо намагання встановити перемир’я або союз з росіянами, закінчується, завжди погано, а ці розумні істоти цього при знайомстві не побачили.

Шейдеры тут прям конечно адски жрут производительность, и в некоторых сценах, может проседать ФПС, а я напомню... RTX 3060! Нехилая такая штука, которая должна рвать релиз 11-летний давности, но увы. Справедливости ради, происходит это не часто, и это не мешает играть, однако очень заметно когда появляется. 

Также меня очень порадовал геймплей! Играл я на нормальном уровне сложности, и скажу так: лута хватает с головой и в конце игры прям очень много ресурсов остаётся. Планирую пройти оригинальную версию 2010 года уже на хардкоре, чтобы проверить как там обстоят дела, но я слышал что там тайников нет, поэтому думаю что будет сложнее...
Стрельба выполнена на высшем уровне, пушки разные, и у каждой есть как и плюсы, так и минусы... Несколько видов гранат, нож, ещё нужно следить за маской, когда появляется радиация, подзаряжать фонарь и в купе получается прям базированный шутан. Стелс в игре не особо интересный, очень узко и враги тебя могут не заметить в открытую, поэтому мне больше понравилось стрелять (хотя прошёл на обе концовки, поэтому и по стелсу тоже успел пройти игру). Система морали тут реально иногда странная, но вроде не должно быть проблем быть хорошим парнем.
Ещё мне нравиться, что игра реально иногда держит в напряжении и в мрачной атмосфере, ты не можешь понять где бегают мутанты и иногда реально пугаешься их, прям реально хоррор. А постановка в некоторых моментах, прям вообще отвал головы! Прям Atomic Heart напомнило)

Сюжет же, не сказал бы что очень интересен, но персонажи колоритны и с ними интересно взаимодейсьвовать и слушать) Постановка в некоторых моментах прям очень странная за счёт того, что наш персонаж немой. Честно, не сказал бы что игре это идёт на пользу, особенно странно осознавать, что вне нашего внимания он разговаривает. А персонажи когда к нему обращаются, он же их просто игнорит! Как они его понимают? В общем, халв лайф скосплеить не удалось)

Как итог, хороший линейный шутан, прям реально один из лучших, что я трогал! Тем более в сеттинге России, ну прям реально БАЗА! Есть некоторые странности и шероховатости, но это не страшно, так как играть в неё очень интересно!

Финальная оценка: 8/10 | The survival horror genre has started a number of recognizable gameplay traditions. The constant tension, the emphasis on atmosphere, the helplessness of the main character, limited items/ammo -- all of these mechanics are among the reasons why survival horror games are so enticing. Metro 2033 is a first-person shooter that borrows heavily from these traditions in order to create an atmospheric experience. Although Metro 2033 is an intriguing journey, I was terribly frustrated by a number of stealth scenarios and technical glitches.

Based on a Russian novel by Dmitry Glukhovsky, Metro 2033 is set in post-apocalyptic Moscow. After nuclear devastation ravaged the earth and skies, the people of Moscow retreated into the sprawling underground Metro system in order to survive, building tattered towns at various stations throughout. The world is populated by mutants, dangerous anomalies and a number of supernatural occurrences. In the midst of this strange setting, players take control of the young Artyom and guide him on his quest to deliver an important message to a neighboring station. He'll fight a ton of generic enemies in order to get there, with a few surprises along the way.
 | [h1]优秀的游戏设计和叙事，却仍然掩盖不了其幼稚的反战反共，无政府主义思想 [/h1]

----------------------------------------------------------
      地铁的故事设定于第三次世界大战，人类使用了核武器导致地球环境被破坏，只有极少数人躲进了地铁之中才得以生存，游戏又在这里设计了三方人类势力，一个是红军，一个是纳粹，还是有一个被称为猎人的组织，而在这里，游戏制作组却又直白地暴露出他们近乎天真的政治思想
      在游戏里，无论是遇到纳粹还是红军，无一不是以贬低之笔法而示人，到了猎人组织却又一改其风格，描绘的万家灯火歌舞升平，虽贫穷但人人自得了，似乎一个具体的政治组织，远不如一个由官僚和士兵所建设起来的组织要好，可这能成为事实吗？

      让我们暂时先抛开什么共产什么战争，抛开一切的主义之分，先从最简单的分配上入手
无论是何时，为了生存，就一定需要食物，为了食物，就一定需要生产，而为了生产，就一定需要劳动，又因生产的无限需求，才会出现工具来帮助劳动
      但问题就在于，无论是进行食物生产的原材料（种子等等），还是帮助劳动的工具，都不可能做到人人都有，又或者，即使人人都有了，当生产变得愈发熟练之时，又会有多余的食物出现，对于这部分产品，由谁生产便由谁占有吗，或者由一人全部占有吗，这时又由谁来决定呢？即使能在一两件事情上达成个人的协议，那些不能达成协议的事情呢，或者国家的事情上呢？
      当人人都处在一个同样的经济地位之时，当没有一个处于超人地位的组织之时，当没有一个组织来领导个人去生产生活的时候，就必然出现这样的僵持的局面，只有由一个拥有权力的组织来决定的时候，才能打破这个僵局，将生产生活之必须之组织而毁灭，转由个人去解决其所不能解决之问题，这就是无政府主义所失败的必然原因

      只有组织业已存在，才有探讨其未来的组织形式，政治思想之可能，而只有解决了生产生活之必要问题之后，才有谈论政治之可能，只有解决经济问题，解决生存问题后，才有转而解决政治问题之可能，但如何解决经济问题，却从来不是一个纯经济问题，而常常包含着政治问题，[b][u]经济基础决定上层建筑，上层建筑反作用于经济基础[/u][/b]，这当然是真理，但如果把这条规律视为绝对的不可动摇的，必须完全遵循的死规矩，而忽视了政治在经济问题之中的领导作用，忽视了政治的灵活性，而把政治和经济当作是这样两种水火不容的，绝对独立的事物的时候，是一定会走向错误的道路的

      当政治制度领先与经济基础之时，我们应该怎么做？是在政治上开倒车，去强迫自己适应落后的经济基础，或者静静等待经济建设追上来，还是要继续加强政治建设，用先进的思想指导经济正确发展，减少或避免走弯路，从而达到两者相适应或减少差距的结果呢
      因此，无论是在什么时候，无论是末日还是和平，都不能放松政治建设哪怕一分一毫，否则就是在拖累整个社会进步的速度，也是在减慢经济发展的速度
      我们当然会在实际的实践中遇到问题，先进的分配制度无法承担落后的经济现实，过度的政治建设压抑了人民合理的自由等等，我们必须要正视这些问题，但绝不能因此就否定整个政治制度，只有当这样一个政治制度已经开始从根本上走弯路了的时候，才需要团结起来推翻它，在次要矛盾上走了错路，只要不是一意孤行，总是还有机会改正的

      一个社会存在一个问题，把它指出来当然是正确的，可如果为了各种目的，而把一个独立的事件写成一个普遍的事件，利用着信息差而蒙骗着其他人，这又是否是正确的呢？地铁正是用着这样的笔法来把红军和纳粹中所存在的问题给强调了出来，又用各种或自述或他述来让玩家感觉红军和纳粹一无是处，却丝毫不提猎人内部的问题，实际上，一个问题的存在，不单单是由政治制度而决定，就比如贪污问题，挂到社会主义国家可能有，挂到资本主义国家也可能有，挂到封建国家更可能有，把一个社会问题不加思辨就和社会制度而挂钩，归根到底还是要为了自己所希望的无政府主义唱赞歌
      同样的，《组织部来了个年轻人》这本书，不恰恰就是这种手法的代表作吗，把一个典型问题扩大化，让读者以为全中国上上下下都是这样一片的无边无际的黑暗，王蒙这种三流文人，怎么现在又不敢写一本这样的书了呢，难道我们现在就没有这样的问题了吗？当然不是，他写与不写，写什么与不写什么，归根结底也是为了他自己的利益而服务，并且是要把这种利益放在一个高于人民之利益的地方的，靠着吃过去的老本，拿着一两本书就想享受一辈子荣华富贵的人终究是要掉落下来的

      红军和纳粹，是一定要互相对立的，这是其指导思想上的互斥使然，如果我们来到一个虚构的社会，在这个社会里，红军和纳粹出现了一个共同的敌人，这时他们还应该要互相战斗吗？如果我们再抽象一点，当一个矛盾从主要矛盾变为次要矛盾，新的主要矛盾已经摆在我们眼前之时，我们是否还应该首先解决没解决完的次要矛盾，而忽视迫在眉睫的主要矛盾呢
地铁在这个问题上给出了很好的答案，却给出了错误的步骤，游戏借主角之口否定了红军和纳粹互相战斗的合理性，在游戏所虚构的环境中无疑是完全正确的，但却同时否定了意识形态战争的延长性和持续性，否定了战争之中双方的共同责任，这更无疑的暴露出游戏制作组天真的反战思想
      两个政治实体的战争，一定都出于某个具体的矛盾，如果这个矛盾通过战争得以解决，在没有新的矛盾出现以前是无论如何不会再有战争的，但如果这个矛盾双方是两个具体的意识形态，一方存在之基础是另一方的毁灭之时，这个矛盾是绝不会突然就消失了的，即使是战争也很难消灭它，因此才会出现冷战
      即使面对了一个第三方的新的敌人，旧的威胁也仍然没有清除，即使在此刻已处于次要地位的意识形态对立也仍然无时无刻威胁着自身的生存，在这样的情况下又怎么能强求一个政治实体抛弃自身的意识形态和另一个政治实体联合呢
      这当然不是不可能，国共合作就是最好的例子，但要促成这样的结局就需要有一方在或政治或经济或民心上占有优势，并可以承担被背叛的结果之时，才能又合作又斗争，共产党在当时顺应了全国人民合作抗战的呼声，并且是生擒了老蒋才逼迫他同意联合抗战，在地铁的世界观里，这样的事情又怎么可能发生呢，因此也就不可能出现两者联合起来的未来，这当然是一个悲哀的未来，但这不才是正常的未来吗，难道要抱着虚假的期盼来看待一切事物吗？这绝非希望主义，乐观主义，而只是不着边际的幻想而已，地铁正是在这里犯了这样的一个错误

      地铁描述了一个新的物种，一个超人类的新进化的物种，同时又设计了两种结局，一种是[spoiler] 好结局，主角把新物种视作进化的产物，并放弃攻打它们的聚集地 [/spoiler]，一种是[spoiler] 坏结局，主角仍然把它们视为敌人，选择用导弹让它们飞起来 [/spoiler]
      在这个问题上地铁做了很好的设计，即使放到现实，人类不再是最优势物种之后，我想我们也会有这两类人出现
      生物如何进化？从现在的生物进化来推导，未来的生物进化也一定要往大脑上走，也就是说，即使我们不再是生物链顶端的生物，新进化的生物也一定是一个有智慧的生物，这就为我们和它们之间的主动接触创造了可能，但即使它们不再是智慧生物，人类从生存中寻找规律，寻找经验，并最终实现共处的可能性也依然存在
----------------------------------------------------------

      但地铁依然讲述了一个在危难中人人自危，却仍努力生存互帮互助的故事，这样的精神无论是在虚拟的世界还是在现实都是必要的，是必不可少的
      从游戏上说，现在的版本作为重置版，画面虽然经过更新，但依然看起来非常模糊，打开HDR后还会有过曝的现象，垂直同步也有BUG，打开后反而会出现非常明显的画面撕裂
      对于射击方面，我是拿手柄同时用DSX模拟自适应扳机玩的，玩起来很爽
      总而言之，即使它有着我上述那些问题，但无论是想体验剧情还是射击还是潜行，还是一起体验一款剧情+PVE+PVP+潜行+割草的游戏，地铁都很适合你

Судячи з того, як виглядають місцеві декорації, ""спецоперація"" явно йде за планом. Кремль? Розвалений. Ваньки? Блукають під землею зі своїми балалайками. Залишається тільки насолоджуватися видовищем і роздавати ""демократію"" кожному совкодрочеру, що потрапить під руку.

Особливе задоволення приносить можливість гатити москалів прямо в їхньому природному середовищі — серед радіації, руїн і відлуння балалайок. А що може бути кращим фіналом пригоди, ніж прогулянка знищеним Кремлем? Гра не лише дарує незабутні емоції, а й викликає задоволення від споглядання того, як усе це перетворилося на руїни.

76561197999482693,301520,Robocraft,0.0,"Action, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Simulation, Free To Play",0,"Разработчики уничтожили игру

Очень любил эту игру до того,как разработчики испортили её.Раньше все старались построить хорошие машины,выбрать те оружия,которые им по душе.Были Тиры,и каждый Тир был сбалансирован,не было через чур(были,но немного) сильный противников.Было Древо улучшений.А сейчас - разнацветные кубики,пыль,кейсы,игроки строят коробки на одной ножке или коробки с ротором и цепляют на него самые имбалансные пушки,которые выпали из купленных кейсов.Подбор противников просто ужасен.Игру облегчили для максимума(чтобы любой идиот,у которого есть деньги мог играть в это и донатить как можно больше) и превратили в помойку.Раньше было намного лучше.Разработчикам важен только донат,а не сама игра. | Uwaga! Opis mechanik gry jest już przestarzały(wyjaśnienie na końcu);

Dobry przykład jak ze świetnej gry zrobić totalnego gniota bez balansu nastawionego na grind i mikrotranzakcje wymuszające kupno premium by mieć jakąkolwiek szansę normalnego rozwoju konta. Gra kilka lat temu była świetna, przyjemny rozwój robotów, przyjemne walki, gra była nastawiona na umiejętności budowy robotów, co było bardzo ważną umiejętnością, a walka polegała na starannym niszczeniu najsłabszych punktów przeciwnika. Było trochę problemów z balansem, ale twórcy kompletnie nie potrafili ich naprawić mimo tego, że gracze pisali wielokrotnie co trzeba zmienić.

Twórcy wszystkie problemy zaczęli ""rozwiązywać"" od najgorszej strony, tworząc przy okazji nowe problemy. Z czasem gra straciła jakikolwiek sens posiadania umiejętności budowy, ponieważ teraz często liczy się kto pierwszy zaatakuje, a nie skill. Tutaj już nawet nie trzeba budować, twórcy dali możliwość kupowania robotów innych graczy, przez co nie ma sensu się starać, lepiej kupić potężnego bota aktualnej mety, po co budować, skoro wszystko i tak będzie gorsze? Tu też przychodzi drugi problem, balans. Zawsze był z tym problem, lecz kiedyś nie aż tak duży. Jak zwykle twórcy nie potrafią rozwiązywać problemów, przez to w grze jest pewna tzw. ""meta"", czyli najskuteczniejsze boty w grze. Przez idotyczne decyzje twórców ta liczba w tej chwili wynosi bodajże 3(tak, 3 typy robotów są skutecznie na wyższym poziomie umiejętności, reszta to strata nerwów i przegrywanie). Mobilność bota jest wszystkim ponieważ nawet najtwardsze boty topnieją w chwilę, więc nie ma sensu budować niczego innego. Chcesz pobawić się tworząc ładnie wyglądającego bota? Zapomnij, chyba, że nie masz nic przeciwko przegrywaniu 3/4 gier. Twórcy nie potrafią rozwiązać jakichkolwiek problemów z balansem. Do tego doszedł system skrzynek, który polega po prostu na tym, że gigantycznie zmniejszył średnią zdobywaną kasę za bitwę oraz zachęca do kupowania premium w postaci ""patrz, super rzadki item, kup premium to go dostaniesz!"". Bitwa za bitwą a zbudować to, co przedtem mogliśmy po ~30 bitwach teraz musimy zagrać ich ~200. Chyba, że ma się farta i się wydropi legendarny przedmiot. Ewentualnie gra pokaże go w slocie premium i będzie chciała zachęcić do jego kupna. Recykling bezużytecznych itemów na kasę w grze daje idiotycznie małe wartosci, prawie nic, gracze domagali się podniesienia wartości recyklingu, po wielu miesiącach, twórcy w końcu zrobili to, ale tylko, kiedy ma się premium(!), powodując, że teraz premium nie tylko dwukrotnie zwiększa ilośc itemów ze skrzynek, to teraz trzykrotnie zwiększa wartość recyklingu każdego itema. p2w tego nie można do końca nazwać, ale definitywnie jest to PayWall. Aktualne premium powoduje, że otrzymamy tyle, ile przed updatem zanim zmniejszyli nagrody za bitwy. Grając za darmo otrzymujemy 6x mniej. Powodzenia zbudować bota z ulubionym wyposażeniem. Gra bez premium to katorga, W dodatku gra jest wieczną alfą, co służy tylko temu, by twórcy mogli sobie dowoli zmieniać so chcą, np. jeszcze bardziej zwiększając rolę mikropłatności w grze. W rzeczywistości gra jest w gorszym stanie niż 2,5 lat temu. Kilka miesięcy temu było baardzo źle i weterani uciekali od tego szajsu. Teraz jest jeszcze gorzej.

Podsumowując: Stuprocentowy negatyw.

@edit 24.05.2019 r.
Sporo się zmieniło, nie ma już lootboxów, powrócili (nieudolnie) do tierów oraz drzewka technologii. Gra jest nadal masakryczna. Fizyka skopana, najlepsze roboty to pojedyncza broń T5 na lekkim i szybkim(najlepiej latającym) bocie. ""Connecting To Server"" wszędzie, a w dodatku by zniwelować ubytek graczy nie można już wybrać trybu gry z rotacją co godzinę. Tak. Ta sama mapa, ten sam tryb, te same ustawienia PRZEZ GODZINĘ. Dodali ulepszanie broni(by zadawały jeszcze więcej DMG!), więc TTK jeszcze bardziej zmniejszyli(za czasów Overclockingu ludzie nienawidzili buffowania DMG, widać twórcy nic się nie nauczyli). Robopassy dające jakieś kiepskie kosmetyczne przedmioty by trochę kasy wyciągnąć z umierającej gry.
Od Grudnia 2018 r. stracili połowę istniejących graczy. Jak to zrobili? Pośrednio twórcy w końcu zobaczyli, że Robocraft z początków był lepszy, więc próbują wprowadzać rzeczy i mechanikę, która była w tamtym czasie. Problem jest taki, że po pierwsze robią to nieumiejętnie, po drugie, że nadal próbują swoje ""nowości"". Na końcu otrzymujemy dziadostwo, w które nie da się grać. W tą grę gra mniej ludzi niż w Spore. I pomyśleć, że Robocraft ze swoją unikalną receptą na grę posiadał ponad 7 tysięcy aktywnych graczy.

Jakiś czas temu wyszli z Early Access, a przynajmniej zrobili to teoretycznie, bo gra nadal się zmieniała drastycznie. W sumie gra jest w gorszym stanie niż w czasie wczesnego EA.

@Edit, 14.07.2019.
No i stało się. Robocraft upadł. Freejam zwalnia ludzi bo mają mało kasy, przyznali się, że Robocraft po opłaceniu serwerów wychodzi na minus. Wszystkie zasoby idą na RobocraftX(tworzenie gry od początku). Będą utrzymywać serwery tak długo jak to będzie możliwe i naprawiać większe bugi. Kilka lat ludzie pisali co jest źle z grą, mówili jakie błędy popełniają twórcy, wszystko dostali na tacy, twórcy mieli to gdzieś i dalej rozwalali grę po swoją tajemniczą ""wizję"", która się zmieniała co update dalej rozwalając grę dziwnymi rozwiązaniami, o które nikt nie prosił. To się nie mogło inaczej skończyć Radzę nie wydawać nawet grosza na tą grę, bo pieniądze mogą przepaść. | Encontre este juego hace unos años atras. Encontre un potencial exito indie multiplayer, como por ejemplo lo que hoydia es Rocket League.
Me enamore de sus mecanicas, y del desarrollo que Freejam de entregaba a su juego, sin duda yo me alegre bastante cuando Robocraft gano el Indie del Año por parte de IndieDB.

Era esos dias en donde era una Arena 10vs10, donde llegar a Tier 10 te hacia en uno de los mejores del juego. En donde tenias que ser consistente para ir desbloqueando todas las mejoras del arbol de tecnologias. En donde la sinergia del jugador y su maquina, y lo mas importante y lo que actualmente se perdio: completo trabajo en equipo. Y quien llevaba a nivel 100 era considerado un Dios.

Donde la habilidad era para saber construir el mejor vehiculo, en todos los ambitos posibles. En donde se copiaban diseños pero aun asi quedaban con un toque personal.

Esos dias. Antes de las torres. Antes de los Megabots. Antes de los medicos.
Cuando solo habian 3 clases. Y aun asi digo que la inclusion de los medicos dio un giro muy positivo al juego.

Donde TODOS. Iban en una fila por una de las 2 lineas principales del mapa. Y en donde se producia un 50/50 en donde podia quedar la absoluta mie*da en una batalla de 10vs10 frente a frente. Y en donde el equipo contrario llegaria a su base y el equipo de dividia para ir a defender la base.

Updates pasaban y no habia tanto cambio. Incluso la inclusion de las torres era una idea fantastica, y todo el mundo en los foros dio su apoyo. Pero simplemente y en mera opinion mia, no fue ejecutada de manera efectiva, o sonaba mejor en papel. Aun asi el juego era bastante bueno en esos momentos y todavia se apreciaba ese espiritu competitivo. Lo que realmente afecto al juego fue el sistema de respawn. Antes la gente hacia cosas imposibles para sobrevivir. O intentar capturar la base enemiga. Con el respawn vi morir frente a mi todo eso.

Hasta que 2 mecanicas nuevas mataron mi idea original del juego.
Las cajas y el nuevo sistema de ""dinero"".

Incluso yo estaba a favor de perder dinero por reparar el vehiculo cada vez que perdias. Y ahora hasta puedes comprar vehiculos prefabricados.
Seguramente si el juego hubiera ido por buen camino, ahora mismo estaría jugando competitivamente en un clan.

Pero lamentablemente soñar no cuesta nada. Intentar arreglar la dignidad de este juego, mucho.

EDIT:

Me han llegado comentarios que estoy tirando mie*da al juego solamente porque soy (""fui"") ""manco"". Los estoy borrando porque la verdad no demuestran nada objetivo.

This was one of my favorite games back in 2014. It had everything you could ask for: balancing, a good community, active and attentive devs, weapons that complemented each other, fun gameplay, good progression, lack of ""pay2win"" and so forth. Needless to say, it was awesome.

Then the January 2015 update was released.

The January 2015 update added a new gamemode where you destroy towers, levelled up, and respawn if destroyed. Initially, me and the rest of the community thought ""Cool."" and waited to see what else was in store. Little did I know that the downfall of Robocraft had begun.

(Order not completely accurate)

""Megabots"" (gigantic robots basically) were removed as soon as the update came out, if not before.

Crates were introduced (partially replacing the robits system), level based CPU limits eliminated, and the tech tree removed, eliminating progression, reducing creativity, and generally made the game much worse. Despite the huge outcry and the veterans and other players who started to leave the game, the devs simply ignored the community and moved on.

Helicopter blades were added, enabling people to make flying fortresses (maybe literrally). Personally I don't think much of this.

Then weapons, most notably an anti-air cannon and a minigun, were added, making weapons unbalanced and the game more frustrating to play. As a pilot in Robocraft (a more ""traditional"" one who used plasma bombers), this particulary saddened and angered me.

A robot shop was added, further reducing creativity.

An intro was added into the game, giving the game a more ""cheezy"" feel and making it seem as if the developers were copying other games. By this point, I personally felt that the developers were catering more toward children (12 year olds) and no longer valued older players and veterans.

All this time, veterans and other older players were leaving the game as it became increasingly apparent that the developers were not listening to the community. 

A new chat system was added, featuring a clan system that the community had been asking for for a long time. This was not nearly enough however, as the other changes above (as well as others) and the careless developers made the game unenjoyable for me (and potentially other older players, although I can not speak for them on this matter).

I finally left Robocraft for good in mid 2015 (shortly after the new chat system was introduced) after a brief stint operating a hovercraft with SMGs.

In it's current state, Robocraft is unbalanced and unenjoyable. The developers are careless and possibly largely inactive (aside from bugfixes and tweaks). Gameplay is frustrating, gamemodes horrible. 

As another reviewer (spynathan) has said: ""From Robocraft to Robocrap.""

If, somehow, all (and I mean all) changes to the game were reverted back to sometime before the January 2015 update, say, November 2014, me and other members of the community (read their reviews to see what they have to say) who have left Robocraft may very well return.

Until then, goodbye Robocraft. | 看我的游戏时间就知道了。这确实是一个好游戏，我还买了永久会员，但他现在确实让我失望了。我也是从T级时代走过来的人，RC的变化我也历历在目。不过现在，FJ的小霸王服务器，将游戏改的一塌糊涂，各种毒瘤载具对新手的压制，虽然出了简体中文，玩家也更多了，但为什么RC的评价在从好评如潮下滑到褒贬不一呢？我们应该思考，FJ更应该思考。"

Besides the smooth graphics and gameplay, and the wonderful sound design and music, it was a fantastically-made RTS flipped upside-down by adding in a third dimension.  The difficulty curve can be steep until you learn just how obscenely powerful Salvage Corvettes are.  Even in the Remastered Edition, where you are limited in how many of them you can build.  The sequel, Catalysm, is missing because it cannot be run on any OS after Vista.  This is tragic, given that it is far closer to the original than Homeworld 2. | Back in it's earlier days when mods first hit, I loved this game, never actually finished the story though the mods just made it far more fun to just do skirmish.

However I'm not a fan of the 3d movement it's rather frustrating keeping track of everything and everything just seems a little too small, or the scale of the map is a bit too large idk I wish they went with more of a grid system.

Shame it seems modding has gone as far as it's gonna go.

I dont hate or really love the game I did play it a lot when star wars mods released for it and  was hyped.

Good game, just dont get the 3rd game. | I love Homeworld.  I would recommend the series to anyone who enjoys strategy games or simply a good story.

However, Gearbox hates Homeworld.  They axed the mobile game without warning - not even the devs knew beforehand - and they broke the Classic version of the original Homeworld here in the Remastered bundle (and Classic is the superior version, because it uses the actual ballistics of 1's engine instead of the chance rolls of 2's).  It's practically unplayable, because basic ship functionality (docking fighters) doesn't work.  Hasn't worked for about 1.5 years, because they patched the game for their Remaster multiplayer malarky and broke the 20+ year-old singleplayer Classic campaign in the process.

The problem has been reported and acknowledged, and it has become apparent they have no plans to fix their game.  Because Gearbox hates Homeworld and its fans."

Не рекомендую цей піс оф щіт | It is exactly what it seems like. An X-com style isometric shooter set in the wild west, mixed with urban fantasy elements. It doesn't try to be anything more, or anything less.

The biggest distinction is it's luck mechanic and heavier narrative focus. What it means is that the chances of you shooting someone or getting shot are a lot more easier to predict and wager, while your engagements are a lot more scripted, less randomized. Also, the posse you get are nearly all scripted, so the game is balanced around that as well. It all makes the game feel a lot more fair, but it also makes it way easier to master and complete than regular x-com, so it may not be appealing to the really hardcore players. But for me it was just right. | I would not recommend this game for people who are looking for a thoughtful, Western X-Com game. Hard West is a mixture of table top game and X-Com like fights but there is something off and janky about the game. I have tried multiple times to beat the Retired Demon, about 2 hours of time tonight and the limitations of the came comes front and center.

The game doesn't allow you to have a manual save or even multiple save states so if you go into a battle scenario under prepared you will lose and lose repeatedly. I cannot heal other team mates, and there is a lack of in mission options for recovering health unless you equip multiple before battles. I also have realized that some of the Playing Card abilities are very finicky, like the eating the dead one that I had equipped on my crazy moonshiner which would only randomly work at times. I would be standing on a tile with a dead enemy and I could not eat the flesh and even after swapping around which tile I was on.

The GUI and interface, the controls are exactly like X-Com and similar game but there was even 3 to 4 hours in an apprehension about ""If I Right click vs Left click is it going to back out on what I was going to do?""

I love the weird West genre, and I love most Westerns too, but this game just left me frustrated. When I tried to back out of the section I was in to see if I could go back a few turns on the table top portion it straight  up just restarted all my progress in that chapter.

I just wish that there was more forethought put into certain aspects of the game play mechanics and the way the game flows. But I will say if you want a crazy tough experience, even with the jankiness, give the game a shot. For people who want a game that doesn't have the extreme jank that I experienced, look elsewhere for your Weird West X-Com."

Aunque todavía no aprendo a realizar los ultra combos :'') | Ultra Street Fighter IV é um dos melhores jogos da minha vida. Sempre gostei de Fighting games e na época do PS3, joguei muito USF4, então recentemente vi o jogo em promoção e pensei: ""Por quê não?"".
Foi um momento muito nostálgico pra mim. Ver a introdução do jogo, ouvir o narrador exclamar ""ULTRA STREET FIGHTER FOUR!"", ver meu nome no perfil de jogador novamente e claro, selecionar o Guy(meu main na época do PS3), são coisas que me fizeram sentir que aquele garotinho feliz fã de SF ainda existe.
Esteticamente, é um jogo incrível, um dos melhores da franquia.
Os gráficos são lindos, mesmo o jogo tendo mais de 1 década.

76561197999482693,244630,NEOTOKYO,4.15,"Action, Free To Play",0,"Note, I played this game well before steam started tracking hours. I have much more play time than 1.4 hours ! Also, to be be clear most of this is written from my memories of playing this game 6 years ago now :)

    Neotokyo came a bit after the golden period of massive free to play FPS games, like Combat Arms, Blackshot, Sudden Attack, Alliance of Valiant Arms among many others. However, it gave a bit of breath into what I would say was the fall of the F2P FPS model. Being a mod, it offered a plethora of modified variants to the standard FPS game modes all without the overarching micro-transaction schemes that plagued other F2P FPS games. To me, this was a gem of a game. 

    It offered a bit of hype on its release with a stellar trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOh3xYPrYF8 It also introduced its new populace to a great universe, namely, Ghost in the Shell. A bit topical now considering the impending release of the live action movie; I digress, this was a great introduction to interesting character archetypes. Some of which are even utilized somewhat in the F2P FPS Ghost in the Shell: First Assault (not to say that they copied, but to show it's ability to carry over the common character themes.) 

    In addition to it's legacy, Neotokyo had or I should say, still has one of the best soundtracks in modern gaming. Made by Ed Harrison: https://edharrison.bandcamp.com/ (Seriously, give it a listen :)).

    Although I have given this game a recommendation it is quite reserved. As it stands, the game is with-out-a-doubt: dead. If possible, gather some buddies and have an in-house together, or just explore the maps by yourself. You'll give yourself a treat viewing what I believe to be some of the best put together community maps pre-workshop alongside a fantastic soundtrack. | Neotokyo is an awesome game, if u like GITS and Akira this game is for you, The music the maps the feeling of the game will make you feel like if u were in a GITS episode.
Awesome community as well, really friendly ppl.
 Dont give up on it just cuz u cant kill someone, practice and u will have the hang of it.
Communicate alot with your friend and you will achive victory.
Dont let NEOTOKYO die, this wonderful game is what GITS online should have been.

NeoTokyo sets you in a cyberpunk world where you fight and get brutally blown apart. Its surprisingly good fun but lacks the players, the only reason i am not playing is this. I only managed to get 80 minutes as of this review being published and I hardly know about the advanced mechanics. 

Its worth the download, its free too | Le meilleur remède pour tous les problèmes, c'est la patience.

76561197999482693,272510,NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM Revolution,10.35,"Action, Adventure",20,"Not the worst Naruto game i've ever played, theres not much of a story other than the Original Story in this game and i think the Mecha Naruto story was done better in this game than the anime, and i prefer how they potray Shisui in this game compared to what i remember from the anime.
I actually like the strategic take on the gameplay where you choose between Ultimate Jutsu, Awakening, or Support Drive Type for the battle mechanics change that easily separates your playstyle, and the Ninja World Tournament Mode is a fun addition to the game (which is a shame that you cant really play it with 4 actual players).
The game is locked in 30fps but i don't find it being a problem for me cuz i feel like playing it in 60fps kind of ruin the timing for its animations, even though Storm 4 probably have a better fight mechanic, Revolution still have a more balanced characters in my opinion.
Multiplayer is definitely where the game shines, but the Multiplayer is dead cuz i only managed to get like 2 matches and never again.

For what its worth Storm Revolution gave you quite a big Roster, considering how cheap the game is when its on sale i'll say that its a good one to pick up and play alone or with ur friends locally. | Одним из основных преимуществ этой игры является богатство персонажей из мира Наруто, которые стали доступны для игры. Вы можете выбирать из широкого списка персонажей, каждый из которых обладает уникальными способностями и техниками. Кроме того, игра предлагает как сражения один на один, так и командные бои, что добавляет разнообразия в геймплей.

Графически игра выполнена в прекрасном анимационном стиле, который передает атмосферу аниме и придает дух эпичности поединкам. Звуковое сопровождение также выполнено на высоком уровне, что подчеркивает динамику и напряженность сражений.

Однако некоторые игроки отмечают некоторую однообразность геймплея и недостаток глубины в режиме одиночной игры. Тем не менее, для поклонников Наруто, ""Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution"" представляет собой отличную возможность побороться в эпических сражениях с любимыми персонажами и насладиться атмосферой вселенной Наруто.

76561197999482693,320040,Moon Hunters,0.016666666666666666,"Adventure, Indie, RPG",0,"I'm not much of an enthusiast of roguelikes, frankly. The whole premise of always playing randomized levels and restarting anew after dying causes me some degree of annoyance. I like the idea of carving out significant feats in the simulation and obtaining enduring benefits — in other words, evolving my avatar and the world around him in a perennial fashion is important. Some of these games are quite unforgiving, while others offer ways to permanently upgrade playable characters for future runs. While Moon Hunters forces you to start each adventure from scratch, it is also structured in such a manner that its playthrough cycles weren't that frustrating to me. But is it worthy of your time? I'm kinda conflicted about it, so bear with me.

The framework here is quite simple. Every run is composed of 5 days, each one representing a level. In the first level, you get to visit one of the game's fixed towns, whereas the final boss is fought in the fifth. The three intermediary stages are all composed of randomized dungeons that take the form of forests, swamps, deserts, caves and mountains. All locations are represented on a worldmap that players get to visualize at the start of each day. The positions of each place and the paths connecting them are also randomized, so the sequence of levels is potentially varied. Moreover, a few unique areas containing specific NPCs can be explored if they show up on the map — they can be accessed before entering the dungeon instance that ends the day.

Now, Moon Hunters has some RPG mechanics. Seven main characters give players some variation of gameplay with their particular attacks and abilities. Their strengths and weaknesses are measured by a simple stat system. You don't exactly level up in this game. Instead, individual stats can be improved through the completion of tasks in towns, dungeons and special areas. NPCs provide dialogue options that increase certain attributes depending on the player's choice. They also initiate subquests that require visiting different places and talking to other folks in subsequent days, with stat bonuses as rewards. Defeated enemies drop money, which can be exchanged at shops for additional passive upgrades. At the end of each day, characters are allowed to perform certain actions at a campsite, and these will spur random events and further stat boons. One of these activities is a rudimentary cooking minigame that utilises ingredients found during normal gameplay. Each one of the 100+ recipes gives a different number of points to your attributes.

Given the short length and the randomized nature of each run, I've always felt like I was running out of time to do things in my playthroughs. Failing sidequests was a common occurrence simply because the areas, points of interest and NPCs required to advance them would simply not appear to me in a timely manner. Traits, a secondary aspect of customization, are gained by a character when he or she interacts with NPCs and special landmarks. Although they do not modify combat in any way, possessing them is mandatory to unlock unique dialogue options and specific sidequest developments. Considering that I frequently missed the window to acquire their necessary traits beforehand, these constant quest failures bothered me a lot. To make things worse, there's also this constellation in the game's menu hub that serves as a barrier of sorts. To unlock the stuff blocked by it, we need to fill it with the spirits of characters that complete the campaign. Each spot in this chart asks for a toon with a particular combination of traits. As you can imagine, completing everything was a pain in the arse. To me, this is certainly the most disappointing system of the game due to its unreliability.

Isometric games are one of my favorite genres, but I wasn't very much impressed by Moon Hunters' features. Sure, you get to improve your character as you play, but most enemies are either dumb, easy to dispatch or unremarkable, with the exception of a bunch of lions and rhinos that do a lot of damage. Playable characters have few attacks and skills at their disposal and you can't really change their standard builds in a significant way. Exploring dungeons is also rather boring because they're usually bare an empty, only containing a few mundane buildings or altars and perhaps a lonely person, while also being quite large — this is a big problem, since most characters move slowly. The familiars you can find (if you get the traits to recruit them, that is) are of no consequence or real usefulness to the adventure. The campaign has just two or three straightforward minibosses, who sometimes don't even show up, and that last boss I mentioned earlier. This final guy is always the same, by the way, regardless of you actions during the run. The only other boss in the game is fought in an arena scenario that you can access with a character previously saved in the constellation.

Regarding NPCs, I found most of them to be rather uninteresting, despite their varied designs and tribal backgrounds. The only character that is properly voiced in the game is the main narrator, who spells her lines during major cutscenes. All other conversations are text based, and they do not convey much of their interlocutor's personality and motivations. It feels as if these NPCs only exist to reveal some tiny trivia about the game's lore and to offer enigmatic hints for secondary quests. Speaking of the story, I couldn't really grasp it, honestly, nor could I remember specific details. The manner by which facts are presented to the player is just too obscure and vague. You don't find books or manuscripts that flesh out the story, either — which is a shame, as I think there's potential for something nice here.

On the technical side, this game's art style is probably its strongest factor. I enjoyed the pixelated visuals of enemies, magical effects and environments, even if they ended up being repetitive. Animations are also nicely fluid. Special mention should be given to the painted portraits of most living beings that appear during conversations. The artists did a good job with them, especially when it comes to the usage of colors. As for the audio, I can't speak much of it. I didn't notice any glitches affecting the sound and everything produced a reasonable effect that you would expect hearing in a fantasy setting, but the soundtrack was barely noticeable. I don't remember listening to any exceptional tunes. However, I did verify glitches in a different department: multiplayer.

Moon Hunters was designed to support up to four players in a single run. I wasn't able to experience much of this mode because, unfortunately, the servers were plagued by a buggy code that caused constant crashes. From what I could understand, this issue was more frequent and severe when the party was composed of people from distant parts of the globe. Still, I didn't see much of a difference in terms of actual mechanics while playing with other folks. Teammates can revive eachother and enemies basically spawn with more hitpoints. That's it, nothing that substantially changes the loop.

After all this criticism, you must be asking why I'm vouching for the game. Well, I believe this is one of those titles that warrant the creation of a ""neutral"" recommendation tag on Steam. Regardless of its flaws, Moon Hunters manages to be a simplistic action-adventure title that actually works reasonably well, considering the scope of the project. It isn't meant to be a deep, engrossing RPG — it's not supposed to tell a grandiose tale nor display an expansive world —, and that's OK if the systems in place provide a concise, but smooth experience. Therefore, I think that most roguelike fans might enjoy at least a few playthroughs. | Good game, bad roguelike. As a game, it's fun, beautiful (not just in looks but also in atmosphere and story), mysterious and memorable. As a roguelike, it's severely lacking content and replayability. It's really sad that the developers decided to pursue a way of permadeath because it doesn't suit the game at all. At least coop is fun... | The game has your problems with multiplayer and simple history, but isn't bad is amazing and beatifull, a god imersion with scenarie and characters.

76561197999482693,322190,SteamWorld Heist,11.433333333333334,"RPG, Strategy",9,"It's fun for a while but becomes somewhat repetitive after the second chapter. 

The balancing feels somewhat off, it's very difficult on the 4th difficulty and pretty much too easy on the third, also you'll get punished and lose xp for playing on lower difficulties which makes utilizing new crew members just even more of an annoying grind. 

There are a couple of other game design choices which bothered me. You are only able to sell items in the loadout screen before a mission or when your inventory is full after a mission, whenever you are in a shop and want to buy something new but you are full you can't - you have to go back to a mission into the loadout screen, sell it there and then comeback - waiting for docking inbetween makes this even more of a pain. 

Whenever there are multiple enemies swarming you, they usually won't utilize the game mechanics of bouncing bullets against walls or rarely flank you, they will just run up to your cover, hold their barrel into it and shoot directly through it, into your face - which feels pretty lame and like not very well coded enemy behaviour. 

Whenever you get overwhelmed and fail a mission you'll lose a good chunk of your ingame curreny - so the entire process of making progress doesn't come down to how smart you play because the level design doesn't bring many opportunities to do so - it comes down how good you've grinded up your character level and gear. I don't think this is a good game design choice for a linear casual game. You'll utilize the same 3-4 squad members and you'll repeat the same gameplay loop over and over again until you've finished the game. If you can't continue you simply need to grind.  

Hats serve no purpose and are just for cosmetics. 

All in all the game feels like a rather shallow 2D X-COM and it definitely has it's flaws. I still think that it has charm and is fun for atleast a couple of hours. I'd barely recommend it whenever it's on heavy discount otherwise I wouldn't. (6/10) | [h1]Roboter im Weltall [/h1]

Nachdem ich mir den [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2396240/SteamWorld_Heist_II/]zweiten Teil[/url] bereits kostenlos dank des Kuratorenprogramms zur Gemüte führen durfte, habe ich mir mal den Vorgänger geholt. Erfahren wir einmal, ob er genau so viel Spaß macht.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
In „SteamWorld Heist“ ändert sich das 2D Buddelspiel der Vorgänger zu einem rundenbasierten Taktikableger. Wir schicken eine kleinen Trupp an Kämpfern mit verschiedenen Kämpfern in kleine Missionen und im besten Fall kommen auch genau so viele Kämpfer wieder aus der Mission raus. Jede Figur hat pro Runde zwei Aktionen zur Verfügung und verfügt einzigartige Fähigkeiten. Im ersten Teil gibt es noch kein Multi-Class Prinzip wie im [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2396240/SteamWorld_Heist_II/]zweiten Teil[/url]. Stattdessen haben die Bots zwar Klassen, entwickeln jedoch mit einem Level-Up einfach linear ihre eigenen Fähigkeiten. Dies schränkt gerade neu rekrutierte Bots erst einmal ein, aber man kann sich ja sehr frei entscheiden, welche Missionen man erledigen möchte oder auch welche Bots man immer mitleveln möchte. Persönlich mag ich es, wenn meine Leute ja ein ähnliches Level haben und relativ ausgeglichen sind.  Wir zielen übrigens selber und bekommen je nach Waffenwahl manchmal eine Hilfslinie. Das Knifflige daran? Die Leute sind etwas unruhig und viele Waffen haben keine Ziellinie, die wie beim Scharfschützen extrem hilfreich sein kann.
Kurzgesagt ist “Steamworld Heist” also ein Sidescroller [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/200510/XCOM_Enemy_Unknown/]XCOM[/url], in dem wir selber kalkulieren müssen, ob der Schuss ins Ziel geht oder nicht.  Der Aufbau der Level und die Art der Feinde werden dabei in jedem Level neu generiert. Also kann auch ein bereits erledigter Auftrag beim zweiten Mal ganz anders laufen. Das Spiel ist ohnehin darauf ausgelegt, dass man viele Level öfters spielt, da man eine gute Sternebewertung oder aber zusätzliche Beute und Erfahrung haben möchte. Trotzdem ist es mit ca. 15 Spielstunden nur halb so lang wie sein [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2396240/SteamWorld_Heist_II/]Nachfolger[/url].
Zum Spielen kann ich übrigens einen Controller empfehlen, mit dem man sich angenehm zurücklehnen kann.

[b]Story[/b]
Nachdem die Erde aufgrund bestimmter Ereignisse nicht mehr so ganz existiert, treiben sich die Bots auf verschiedenen „Scherben“ des Planeten herum und natürlich auch im Weltall. Piper Faraday will als Schmugglerin zwar überwiegend ihre Ruhe, allerdings bekommt sie diese Ruhe dank der Schrotter und der Marine nicht. Also beschließt die Dame auf eigene Faust mal so richtig durchzuräumen. Auf dem Weg kommen wir einer größeren Geschichte auf die Spur und unterhalten uns mit unseren rekrutierten Mitgliedern, die ihren ganz eigenen Charme mit einbringen. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3407461059
Allerdings darf man hier jetzt keine große Geschichte erwarten, die voller Plottwists ist. Stattdessen haben wir unsere eher oberflächlichen Helden und bekämpfen oberflächliche Feinde. Zum Verständnis hilft es, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/571310/SteamWorld_Dig_2/]SteamWorld Dig 2[/url] gespielt zu haben. Aber notwendig ist es sicherlich nicht.

Die Grafik ist konsequent bunt gehalten. Ich mag den rostigen Stil und insbesondere die Machart der Charaktere.

Man kann das Spiel problemlos auf Deutsch spielen. Allerdings gibt es dann doch manchmal Fehler bei den Texten, wodurch man den Sinn nicht mehr versteht. Ich nehme an, man hat da wirklich jemand Englischsprachigen das Spiel ins Deutsche übersetzen lassen. 

[b]DLCs[/b]
Die kosmetischen drei Hüte der Hatbox sind kostenlos verfügbar. Allerdings muss man die sich im Steam Shop manuell holen. Die andere Hatbox enthält ebenfalls nur Hüte, ist allerdings kostenpflichtig. Um man die braucht…Am Interessantesten dürfte das DLC „The Outsider“ sein, in dem wir ein neues Mitglied für unsere Crew bekommen, der eine Verbindung zum Vorgänger [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/571310/SteamWorld_Dig_2/]Steamworld Dig 2[/url] mitbringt. Diese Figur hat nicht nur im Kampf interessante Fähigkeiten, sondern bringt auch ein paar neue Missionen mit.

[b]Fazit[/b]
Genau wie der [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2396240/SteamWorld_Heist_II/]zweiten Teil[/url] hat mir auch der erste Teil sehr gut gefallen. Die Spiele ähneln sich zwar, aber dennoch kann ich beide klar empfehlen. Dieses Spiel fällt hier noch etwas flacher in den Spielmechaniken wie Klassen aus. Auch haben wir noch keine Oberwelt zu bereisen. Man könnte also sagen, der erste Teil ist simpler, aber auch das ist erfrischend. Leider wird es keinen dritten Teil geben, aber ich kann die „Steamworld“-Spiele, die sehr vielfältig sind, trotzdem sehr empfehlen.

However, it falls apart at the higher difficulties due to the alarm mechanic which forces a slower turn based gameplay into a rush as more enemies pile in which can quickly overwhelm you. This is even worse towards the end of the game as you get enemies which can teleport and shoot on the same turn with two or three enemies spawning each turn. This game definitely rewards quicker strategy over slow turn based turtling combat like XCOM. The 100% for this is also really difficult with the whole game being required to be completed on the highest difficulty with no mission failures, all missions fully completed, and in 800 turns or less across the whole game. | Com certeza é um dos melhores jogos de estratégia por turno que já vi.

A história, apesar de simples, é boa e é uma sequência direta dos eventos de Steamworld dig 2. A trilha é opercional, mas os efeitos sonoros são muito bem feitos [se for banco sonoro to chocada]

The levels are so tightly designed that a lot of people consider this game a good puzzle, but as someone who likes the moment-to-moment gameplay itself, I'm impressed they managed to give me 20 hours of content from only 30 levels.

That's thanks to the challenge mode, which tasks you to replay the game multiple times with a certain gamerule. It can be that your guns have one bullet, your throwables kill on impact, or you can only use your katana, which ""remixes"" the experience in an interesting way.
Some of the challenges are really hard, like bare hands, which strips you of the ability to pick up items and forces you to get up close to the enemies, which was so hard, in fact, that it changed my view of the levels entirely and tricked me into mastering the game."
76561197999482693,690040,SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE,0.0,"Action, Indie",0,"It's a rouge-like now for some reason. Instead of a unique map for each level with predictable spawns and weapons, everything is now random. It reduces repetition fatigue while gutting the puzzle solving aspects, it's necessary given how much repetition MCD has. It also makes it more punishing, as enemies can unpredictably spawn behind you with no audio cue. It isn't unfair per say, but MCD asks a lot more of the player than the first game, too much in my opinion. When you've mastered the game enough to beat it, you'll already be bored. The new weapons, exploding and red gunned enemies are nice additions. The bosses, 90% immune enemies and nerf to melee weapons are bad additions, since they restrict movement. The rouge-like upgrades (hacks) are just simple buffs to the weapons or your person, they don't encourage different play. There isn't enough depth for synergy to be possible.

Tying this together is a story that thinks it's good enough to harm the game-play, when it isn't good enough to even be told. If Super Hot's story was a boring premise with an obnoxious but interesting delivery, then MCD is the same boring premise with “a do it yourself” delivery because they couldn't be bothered… but more obnoxious. Having to wait 2.5 hours in game on a loading screen isn't clever writing, it's a bitcoin mining scam. It feels like they had nothing to add so used vague quotes to hide this fact, that isn't a joke, 80% is just vague quotes.

Lastly, they fixed none of the issues from the first game, audio cues are none existence and every bit of information is a bright screen flash wall of text. | прикольно, что новая часть стала реально БОЛЬШЕ, добавили много нового и развили старое. мне понравилось как не оч уместную механику перемещения в тело противника из прошлой части в этой части сделали отдельным классом и такой класс не один

новые типы врагов, ловушки, элементы рогалика, боссы (неубиваемые челы со способностям) - это все в игру привнесло не только разнообразия, но и челенжа которого мне так не хватало в первой части. в ней для меня самым сложным при прохождении на 100% было не заскучать проходя N испытаний, в которых одни и те же уровни с каким-то минимальным отличием и то до этого можно не дойти, тк это не часть основного сюжета. тут же сложность как будто растет по ходу всей игры, это круто мне реально было сложно и я застревал на некоторых уровнях

но есть одна проблема, которая появилась из за внесения в игру элементов рогалика. я в целом люблю рогалики, но проблема в том что в суперхоте не так много билдов которые ты можешь собрать и со временем ты перестаешь открывать новые перки а уровни становятся все сложнее и ты начинаешь душиться из за сложности и отсутствия развития в механиках. да и в рогаликах обычно ты пытаешься собрать что то имбовое, но тут нельзя собрать что то прям мощное, все равно БОЛЬШАЯ часть успеха в прохождении будет оставаться на твоих действиях и скилле, хоть перки и упрощают игровой процесс. короче говоря я задушился, а когда мне сказали в конце игры без перков и классов проходить уровень с 15 этапами я просто выключил, пока не готов к этому.

еще из того что понравилось, в прошлой части немалый акцент был на сюжет и круто что в этой части его почти нет и больше упор на геймплей. сюжет в первой части был интересный но очев что все идут в эту игру за геймплеем, и в сиквеле разрабы как бы говорят ""да, мы понимаем зачем вы сюда зашли, держите то что вам нужно""

как все тут пишут да и сама игра твердит, эта часть понравится тем кому нужно БОЛЬШЕ и кому не хватило прошлой части. я в целом удовлетворен, но в конце задушился. | Just as fun as the first game, if not more so. New enemy types, new weapons, new abilities, and a solid roguelike feel that's challenging without being outright punishing. | ██▓▒­░⡷⠂𝚆𝙴 𝙽𝙴𝙴𝙳 𝙼𝙾𝚁𝙴⠐⢾░▒▓██ | O jogo é uma boa sequência do primeiro, com novas mecânicas de poderes e uma dificuldade superior ao primeiro, porém de acordo com o tempo jogado passa a ser um pouco repetitivo, o jogo tem muitas fases, repetindo várias vezes o mesmo mapa.

A sensação de matar os inimigos é ainda mais satisfatória que no primeiro jogo, há mais variedades de armas também, o que deixa tudo mais divertido, portanto em questão de gameplay ele supera o primeiro jogo.

Game puts a woman inside your brain who never stops talking.
I cannot handle it. I am sorry. This horror game is too scary for me. | Game starts by being extremely messy and overwhelming, bunch of weapons, materials and skills to upgrade thrown at you with barely any explanation. this confusion also spreads to the level design on most missions, stages and enemy placement on them feel completely random, traversing areas is just annoying. story feels like they've only spent 25 minutes on writing it, only time you're not gonna want to skip a cutscene is when ugliness of a character hypnotizes you.
appeal of Shadow Warrior 2 is a simple loop of getting a better weapon and seeing bigger numbers on your screen and that's basically only force that's going to be moving you forward to finish the campaign, grind for a better gear. its built around a replay value but gameplay doesn't give you any satisfaction so it seems unimaginable to me to go for a ng+. (game beaten on ""no pain no gain"" difficulty)
on top of all that, technical issues made it even more annoying, frequent crashes, disconnections, co-op mission once failed to reward both players, overall not a pleasant experience.
good things about this game are weapon designs, they mostly look very cool, some areas are nice to look at and menu theme goes pretty hard. 
it was still fun to play with a friend but i can't let co-op enjoyment blind my judgement here, SW2 is a true abysmal dogs**t. | Truly a Horrid CO-OP experience. Little enemy variety, lackluster weapons, you get a million weapon gems, but very little of them matter. All the enemies are tanky, but not difficult. So it's just hitting a brickwall for way too long. The levels are built like shit, and can be confusing and slow to traverse. The mission tracking is godawful, so the objective furthest from you is highlighted first. The GPS has a little dotted line that is suppose to help you, but it's completely broken. The environments and the character models are beyond ugly. Many times me and my friend were so appalled by the horrid character models we forgot to skip the cutscenes. The writing consists of dumb millennial humor quips, and none of the characters are interesting or likable. Furthermore the overall story is dull and dragged out. I only played 17 hours, but it felt like at least 50. The Game crashed many times, and glitching into the environment was a common occurrence. A Slop game, and I mean that fully. The plus side is the game goes on sale for like 4$, so maybe you can trap a friend completing a slop game with you. | Confusing maps often not clear where to go, and weapons often do little damage and this get boring quickly."

The game is about how the gods abandoned us and we need to kill them/defeat their servants. The main feature of the game is that it is made in the form of frescoes and it is very cool. Alas, there was a bug with textures when I passed the Hephaestus level, but this did not affect my overall rating, because the bug disappeared when I simply re-entered his house) | Crashes constantly, it's unplayable | A fantastic 2d action game. I would classify this game as a beat-em-up. I played through the entire game twice, and my only complaint is that the game wasn't three times longer! (Or that a sequel was never made) You should play it! | I liked the style of this game, the art direction is fantastic and the lighting techniques are phänomenal, voiceacting was nice to. However combat is super wonky and akward, you always take so long to take a swing while enemies are jumping like in super mario, on top of that, the autoaiming on controllers is not great, that game is probably better played on a keyboard.

I came close to liking it however I only can give a negative rewiew because the numerous bugs, glitches and crashes I've encountered, the game crashed like 5 times in my 10 hour playthrough and on top of that I got stuck on a death loop once where the game incorectly placed my respawn coordinates under a platform so I keept falling to death over and over, thank god the game autosaves for you periodicaly or else I just wouldn't have finished it

only buy on a steep discount, without the technical flaws it would be an alright game but with them it becomes frustrating super quick | A pesar de que a mucha gente le parecerá un juego un tanto aburrido, sin sentido y con una jugabilidad cuanto cabe extravagante yo encuentro este juego una maravilla. Es uno de los pocos juegos que me movió a investigar más acerca de un tema como es, en este caso, la mitología griega. Resulta fascinante como este juego abarca la teogonía griega y le da a su vez un protagonismo excepcional al jugador, haciéndolo parte dentro del canon griego con sus diálogos e interacciones con los míticos personajes griegos. La forma en la que extrae diversas citas de varios textos como la Ilíada de Homero, la teogonía de Hesíodo y otros tantos es un factor que le añade muchos puntos a la inmersión en la temática del juego.
El único punto débil del juego es el idioma, es una lástima que el juego esté únicamente disponible en inglés, es una de las causas de que este juego esté tan oculto dentro de los juegos de Steam y esté tan infravalorado en cuanto a jugadores refierese.
Todos aquellos que estén interesados en la mitología griega deben jugar este juego, les va a encantar."

I remember not being able to join friends and after a few games, I decided the game wasn't for me and just another clone.

Being bored and only seeing games with no depth in gameplay and just essentially imitating the original MOBA/FPS formula, I decided to give Gigantic another shot after it came out for Steam. I'm originally from DotA and MMORPG pvp-style games, so having a MOBA-esque theme with third-person gameplay actually fit my needs.

Some elements I definitely like about the game are the strategy involved, artstyle, animations, colorful particles. 
I mean your nexus/core actually jumps to the other side of the field to crush the enemy nexus/core? WTF. These Guardians are huge and makes you feel right there on the battlefield. Not to mention the fact that Clash mode completely changes the map.

On the surface, the game seems pretty simple. You lay minions on control points, you kill other people, and you win the game by killing the enemy boss. What you don't see are the strategic elements in the game. Some examples being:

[*]What limited creature do I summon on this point?

[*]Do I spend my focus on upgrading the creature to an adult or keep it so I can use my ultimate?

[*]One of the Guardians (Boss) is going on a rampage, do I defend/attack the Guardian or do I attack a control point to put more points into the next round?

Then you add on to the defending, healing, sprinting, dodging, engaging, killing, wounding fast-paced part of the game, it becomes quite immersive. Seriously, this game is [b]fast-paced AF[/b] (game time and movement speed). I don't think I've played a game as fast as this. You sprint literally everywhere.

Anyway, back on topic. Motiga isn't a big company, but they seem to be on track with feedback and updates. 
Whether this game gets popular in the future, I definitely plan to stick with this game. A game formula that I actually enjoy with amazing art is rare for me.

I mean this game is F2P. Give it a shot and try it out for yourself and mold your own thoughts. What do you have to lose?"
76561197999482693,214490,Alien: Isolation,0.0,Action,0,"[b]Alien: Isolation is the definitive experience for fans of Ridley Scott’s Alien (1979) film and a landmark achievement in survival horror gaming. Developed by Creative Assembly, this game captures the heart-pounding dread of the original film, placing players in a desperate fight for survival aboard the Sevastopol station. With incredible visuals, masterful sound design, and a relentless AI-controlled Xenomorph, this is a must-play for horror enthusiasts and science fiction fans alike.[/b]

[h1]Story: A Fight for Survival in the Depths of Space[/h1]
[b]Set 15 years after the events of Alien (1979), Alien: Isolation follows Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen Ripley, as she searches for answers about her mother’s disappearance. Amanda’s journey takes her to Sevastopol, a decrepit space station housing a deadly Xenomorph. The narrative masterfully ties into the franchise’s lore, creating a compelling story filled with tension, dread, and human desperation.
The plot unfolds at a slow-burn pace, gradually immersing players in the terror of being hunted by an unstoppable alien predator. Combined with memorable characters and a genuine respect for the source material, the story is a worthy addition to the Alien franchise.[/b]

[h1]Atmosphere: Immersive Sci-Fi Horror[/h1]
[b]The atmosphere in Alien: Isolation is unmatched. Sevastopol feels like a living, breathing space station, brought to life with stunning visuals and meticulous attention to detail. Every corridor, console, and piece of machinery is lovingly recreated to match the retro-futuristic aesthetic of the original film. The flickering lights, hissing vents, and echoes of distant machinery create a foreboding environment that will keep you on edge.
The sound design is equally brilliant. The creaks of the station, the screeches of the Xenomorph, and the eerie silence of space combine to create a constant feeling of dread. Playing with headphones is a must for the full effect.[/b]

[h1]Gameplay: Survival at Its Most Intense[/h1]
[b]Alien: Isolation is a survival horror game in its purest form. Unlike traditional action games, this is not a power fantasy, Amanda is vulnerable and must rely on stealth, resource management, and quick thinking to survive. The Xenomorph is a relentless predator, guided by some of the best AI in gaming. It learns from your actions, adapting its behavior to keep you constantly guessing.
In addition to the Xenomorph, players must contend with hostile androids, panicked humans, and the environment itself. Crafting tools and using distractions are key to surviving, but resources are scarce, and every decision matters. The gameplay brilliantly balances tension and strategy, ensuring every moment feels significant.[/b]

[h1]Visuals and Sound: A Love Letter to the Original Film[/h1]
[b]Visually, Alien: Isolation is stunning. From the retro-futuristic design of Sevastopol to the intricate animations of the Xenomorph, the game is a visual treat. Lighting plays a crucial role, with shadows and flickering lights creating a sense of unease around every corner.
The sound design deserves special praise. The game’s audio perfectly captures the essence of Alien, from the ominous hum of the station to the terrifying roar of the Xenomorph. The dynamic soundtrack intensifies encounters, adapting to the danger level and keeping you on edge throughout.[/b]

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Incredible atmosphere: Faithfully recreates the look and feel of the original Alien movie.
[*]Relentless AI Xenomorph: The unpredictable and adaptive AI creates genuine tension.
[*]Immersive sound design: Eerie and terrifying, adding to the sense of dread.
[*]Challenging gameplay: Encourages careful planning, resource management, and stealth.
[*]Respect for the source material: A must-play for fans of the Alien franchise.
[*]Varied threats: Beyond the Xenomorph, the hostile androids and humans provide variety.
[*]Visually stunning: Beautifully detailed environments and animations.
[/list]
[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Steep difficulty: The game can be unforgiving, which may frustrate some players.
[*]Pacing issues: Some sections feel overly drawn out or repetitive.
[*]No action-oriented options: Fans of more combat-heavy gameplay may feel constrained.
[*]Scarce resources: While intentional, resource scarcity can make certain sections feel overly punishing.
[*]Intense for some players: The constant sense of vulnerability and dread isn’t for everyone.
[/list]

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
[b]Alien: Isolation is the closest gaming has ever come to recreating the nerve-shredding tension of Ridley Scott’s Alien. It’s a game that rewards patience, strategy, and nerves of steel. The meticulous attention to detail, coupled with the dynamic AI and immersive sound design, makes every encounter unforgettable.
While the steep difficulty and intense atmosphere may not appeal to everyone, fans of survival horror and the Alien franchise will find Alien: Isolation to be an unparalleled experience. Whether you're creeping through Sevastopol's dark corridors or holding your breath as the Xenomorph prowls overhead, this is a game that will stay with you long after the credits roll.[/b] | Main menus in games are basically opening sequences of movies. Its there to set the mood, to prepare you for what you are about to play and dive into. Most game don't hit the nail here but some do and Alien Isolation is one of them. A lone space station is seen as a speck in distant orbit of a massive Jupiter like planet. The string quartet begins followed by drowning giving you a sense of something unknown. That to me is the hallmark of game presentation and the main menu of this game achieves everything it needs to for a horror experience. Putting you into a state of unease. Letting the player know that they are going to be isolated and far from help.

Almost all of the player base knows of the infamous IGN review done by Ryan McCaffrey who is now Executive Editor. Ryan gave Alien Isolation a score of 5.9 out of 10, remarking the good consisting of the level design and the immersive environment. Ryan is correct on this matter, due to the team at Creative Assembly gaining access to endless production material for the 1979 feature film. The materials would have included tons of H. R. Giger sketches and also Harry Lange's futuristic space designs and interiors. With this amount of resources, the team was able to craft a space station set in the retro future of the 80s. The level designers understood lighting and how to use areas to make you feel on edge, such as implicating sharp edges to almost look like predator teeth and smooth objects that can almost be mistaken for the aliens creature. The remix of Jerry Goldsmiths score weaves itself through the ship, music tenses or sometimes just stops as though the game to you is indicating danger. However, Ryan then began to list the negatives of the game and one of the major ones he lists was the monster itself. The alien.

One of the most talked about aspect of the game is its main antagonist, Mister Alien. Personally, one of the most terrifying creatures to grace the silver screen and my gaming monitor. Spending many hours in the game you would think that one would eventually get use to the creature. To tell the truth, when I hear that thing enter my domain I am instantly filled with dread. Kudos to the team for making this stress inducing creation and this is where Ryan had his problem, the AI. During a round table discussion where Ryan gathered his review friends to help defend his final score for the game, most of them had indicated the frustration with the AI behavior, its unpredictability. Brian Altano during the discussion started referring to Splinter Cell, indicating set patterns of enemies and knowing where things are. Brian then states the unhinged AI and not knowing its patterns, always being a roadblock. I think all of you know what I am trying to state here. This is the most defining feature of this game. Ask any player who had finished this game and they would always have some nightmare story of their encounter. Its always different. The AI is designed in such a way to adapt to your behavior. The game is survival horror. You have to survive by adapting to an adapting enemy. I guess for video game journalists, they just want a horror house experience. Get locked in a tramp ride where things just jump at you to finally reach the end and just leave. You can have your little Outlast fat men chase you down hallways all you want, but nothing will equal to when the Alien enters the room you are in and starts tip toeing around after goose stepping over to your location. There nothing more terrifying when the bastard stops moving and becomes silent as a mouse to hear more clearly and awaiting for your move. That to me, is horror.

Ryan lastly stated pacing issues. Pacing he is half right on, but I would disagree considering there are points of the game where it does slow down, but even during those moments you are on edge. I think the game does have an issue with some padding. The biggest issue the game has is its story and characters being sidelined. Even then the other two aspects of the game are such a strong foundation that you kind of accept the lack of character or better narrative because so much time was spend on other factors. I could touch on the crafting mechanics of the game and the tools you use for your survival but they also feel sidelined by other elements. The most important things are you, the alien and the ship. Everything else is secondary and that's fine. 

Now there are other problems the game faces that players dislike, not everyone is going to enjoy the stealth. The game is also a slow burner which players would also have an issue with. There is a good reason the game developers recommended the hard difficulty, you get the full horror experience. To me, with all its flaws, Alien Isolation will remain peak horror. I will never forget the one moment that made my sanctuary vent adventures turn into a vent nightmare. No other game has never made me feel so unsafe and terrified in my life. Now whenever I go into vents, I am on edge. This is what a true horror game is. Its when I have no safe space and I must scream. | I finally played it after years of it sitting in my inventory, this might be the best survival horror game of all time. I have never died so much but had so much fun. | For it being more than 10 years old it has not aged a bit
Story and the AI feels like its brand new and even the combat feels clearer at times.
9/10 Aliens | Imagine this as a tom & jerry horror experience! it's 10/10 on that part but at times the cartoon has more story to it."

I'm not saying it is the better game, because BL2 is a great game, but I really, really enjoyed this game and feel a bit sad about the bad rap it got and still gets sometime.

Absolutely a recommend from me. | Très bon jeu, bonne histoire et mécaniques intéressantes.

Якщо у цивці у фракцій є невеличкі відмінності які виражені парою юнітів і перками, то тут у однієї можна переміщати цілі міста, інша тераформує місцевість під себе, а дехто взагалі нормально почуває себе тільки у воді. Але є тут і недоліки які властиві більшості ігр цього жанру. А саме - якщо ти починаєш вириватись вперед по технологіям, містам і оснащенню військ, то перемога тобі забезпечена і навряд станеться щось що завадить виграти. Тобто, в середині гри ти вже починаєш розуміти що ця партія вже виграна, а до досягнення мети залишилось кроків п'ятдесят і ти просто додушуєш цю катку.

A psychedelic diamond. | A社 (Amplitude Studios) 的無盡系列策略遊戲，包括《ENDLESS Space》1跟2、《無盡帝國》，這些遊戲能用的派系不多，但每個派系都很有特色，使用不同派系時，策略必須大幅改變，在這方面比《文明帝國》系列有趣，《文明帝國》系列加上DLC後有很多派系，但不同派系的差異較小，而且有不少派系的特徵比較平淡無趣。
A社是規模不大的獨立開發商，為了節省成本，A社遊戲的聲光效果比不上大作，例如無盡系列的派系領導，畫面和語音較簡陋，但A社擅長設計感，用設計感彌補成本劣勢，遊戲中的各種美術設計都很好看，音樂與音效也不錯。
A社的策略遊戲，有很多要素都是模仿《文明帝國》系列，但A社也有各種創新，例如無盡系列，比《文明帝國6》更早採用""城市區域系統""，也比《文明7》更早採用：地形高低差、改良設施不用工人。A社《HUMANKIND》可途中切換不同派系，《文明帝國7》也有採用，結果《文明帝國》越來越像A社遊戲，有城市區域系統、地形高低差、改良設施不用工人、可途中切換不同派系。
幾年前A社預告《HUMANKIND》的時候，我原本希望它能沿用無盡傳統：派系比《文明帝國》少、但更有特色，可惜A社走相反路線，《HUMANKIND》派系非常多，但都較沒特色。

Narratively speaking, I found the game to be a bit underwhelming. I think that the main premise is kind of uninteresting, and, in turn, the game is heavily carried by the excellent writing of its colourful main cast and marvelous worldbuilding.
Puzzles are fine, too. Not too challenging. However, there's various ways to solve them, which adds some replay value.
The OST, composed by 2Mello, is pretty much perfect. It's fitting, memorable and, most importantly, a bloody goddamn banger. 
While not for everyone, 2064: ROM may prove to be a delightful experience for those who seek an nice adventure in a carefully crafted cyberpunk world, despite its flaws. | For me the experience was clearly a no, but if you have a lot of patience and like the art, you can definetively enjoy the game. There are some good themes an ideas scattered in the first three chapters. maybe the story amount to anything good, but I was too bored and demotivated to keep going on.

The game looked to me like an indie updated version of ""Snatcher"" before buying it, but the timing is badly managed (too much filler?) and the trivial talking take too much time to keep me invested in the story, minigames add frustration instead of variation and the art and character design is the fugliest thing I've seen in a lot of time. Characterization wasn't great too, everybody sounded like an otaku high on redbull and it was difficult for me to connect with anybody.

76561197999482693,333930,Dirty Bomb®,48.016666666666666,"Action, Free To Play",14,"Lets dismiss the rumor that this game is Pay 2 Win, it actually isn't anywhere close to it. If you were to personally ask me what P2W is, I'd say, ""Games with weapons or unlockables (Generally ones that give you an advantage or are just overpowered) not obtainable through playing the game for free, instead using real world money to unlock it.""

TL;DR: Everything above Bronze in loadouts is cosmetic. Characters rotate to play for free every week.

How this game works is entirely different, you get loadout cards, now while you might think, ""Oh, well that must mean that everything Silver and Gold is better than things that are Bronze."" This is not correct, every card above Bronze simply works as a form of cosmetic.
On the other hand you have people that would say, ""Getting a Bronze card would mean you have way too many advantages over players that don't."" This is also not true, as the bronze cards simply give you perks on the side that give you small boosts, no gun damage, health (Except for one perk that gives you up to 30 health for dying multiple times) or other character attributes altered with cards.

Now with these loadout cards, you also get different weapons. These weapons on the loadout cards will change how you play your character. By default you have good loadouts, you can destroy anybody with the basic loadouts so long as you can aim, your guns make you, not your perks. You can get a different gun for every rarity of loadout, even the worst rarities come with guns that can change how you play by alot, but for the most part all the guns are reletively balanced.

Next comes the whole RNG thing that people get very angry at because they can't find good things in cases. 1000 ingame credits = 1 case, this case grants you 1 random loadout card in the game, with the higher tier rarities being lower chances of obtaining, but still possible. if you really want to go all out, you can spend 5 dollars in real world money for some random cases that are primarily used for the higher chance at getting Gold and Cobalt loadouts, but still guarenteed a Silver loadout.

The crafting system is next and it's pretty simple, put in cards you don't like of the same rarity and get the next loadout rarity up, you also select any of the characters that you want a loadout specifically for. Essentially trade up contracts in CS:GO. Pretty easy to understand, gives you another chance at randomizing and it's a way of letting you get loadouts that are Silver and higher without the RNG chance, however the weapons and perks are randomized each time. 
With that being said, if you find that you can't be bothered to open up cases for 1000 ingame credits, you can simply save up enough to just buy a bronze loadout that you like.

Next comes characters. Here's where people have whined most about the game. ""6-10 Dollars for a single character in this game? What a ripoff!"" And here's where I come in and say ""You don't need to spend money, blah blah blah, you can play the game normally and get every character you just need to save up a bit.""
On top of this, there is a free character rotation every week. Just like in League of Legends, every week three characters become unlocked for the week's duration as playable characters, afterwards you need to purchase them to keep them permanently.

To end this I'm simply going to put it. The game is fun, not Pay 2 Win, and it's starting to take up time I would spend playing Tf2. | Most fun I've had with an FPS in a long time. Pretty fast-paced combat, classes aren't too gimmicky. Anyone who digs Enemy Territory or thought Brink had a ton of potential should definitely check it out | I find DB has drifted from what I would want in a game to something I don't like. More importantly, I don't think it will improve enough to enjoy going forward, so I'm going to uninstall DB.

The fundamental reason I'm going to uninstall is that the initial and early characters didn't feel too gimmicky, and they tended to work together. Since that time, they've become more and more ridiculous. Constantly putting in characters that don't really mesh together isn't helping the team aspect of the game. When you can help your team while still shooting the enemy and not need to make a decision about which to do, you have a problem. Throwing health packs, ammo, and needing to be on top of people to revive them encourages smart team play. ""Don't run into the open, we can't pick you up"" Sparks the medic comes out, and more fools over-extend because you can revive them now at a distance, instead of them being dead and gibbed, and they can be picked up. Not being revived is the game punishing bad play by those who over-extend. Javelin dispenses ammo even in fire-fights, so who needs to manage and plan for their ammo? Getting into long fire-fights back in 2015 used to require someone to be very good at managing ammo and position. You had to bring a support character, but that person needed excellent positioning to be able to toss that pack and hit a teammate who needs it without giving it to the enemy, and then quickly be back in the fight. The same is true of the medics. Running a combo of medic/ammo giver required great support. Automatically dispensing ammo in a circle around you doesn't force you to think about how to help your team, and you can help without actively helping. You can both help you team with a power, and shoot an enemy. This isn't encouraging teammates to help each other, it just encourages them to bunch up. Further, key abilities can be done by everyone, like repairing, planting explosives, and reviving. This dilutes the need to take certain classes at all.

Further, rarely has a new character been balanced on release, which means in the the intervening time between release and patch you face a lot of people playing a broken character. In-fact, new characters were never allowed straight into ranked. They would hold them back because they knew they weren't balanced. They eventually gets nerfed, frequently too far, and the cycle repeats. This is irritating, but I also know that characters aren't balanced until you really get a lot of people playing them. I don't know why they feel so far off each time, but I suspect it is because of the aforementioned decision to keep pushing out characters that have odd abilities that need to be special to justify making a new merc. Balancing among more and more abilities also takes more and more effort - effort that could be spent making the one thing that doesn't get enough attention - maps.

Maps. You need more maps. You always need more maps. More maps means more unique strategies, it means you can play a lot of matches without repeating maps (back when there were only 6 maps, I took lots of several week or several month breaks because I didn't want to play the same maps over and over). Each map should highlight a few abilities. You can get the objective done without them and successfully defend without them, but on some maps, some characters should shine without being overpowered. Each map should be able to take advantage of each merc's abilities. I know this is a tall order, but you want to be great, right? The more abilities you have, the more trouble you have where you get into a map and think, ""I brought a terrible merc for this map."" That should not happen, ever. Rhino is a good example. There are some maps where I will never take him, he's far too slow, and he needs to be on top of people to do damage. There are too many maps where he cannot do much, and very few maps where he can truly shine. Similarly, taking Skyhammer or Arty in Underground, is a waste of time (Skyhammer's marker does act like a grenade, but it isn't a great one). Stoker, on the other hand, dominates in Undergound because his ability is always useful. There is no need for that enormous discrepancy between characters. This removes flexibility to form and break defenses. 

While this is definitely a personal preference, the worst part about this game is being one-shot. I don't know why people think this is fun in an arcade-style shooter. In ARMA, SWAT, Rainbow 6, being one-shot killed is fine and I like those games, but not in a game like this. It wasn't fun 20 years ago with the rocket launchers in Quake and Unreal, it still isn't now. The wide-spread availabilty and ease-of-use of one-shot weapons in this game is killing my enjoyment (and I realize that this is a very personal complaint, hence the reason I listed it last). The fact that most people cannot use one-shot weapons well in a fast-moving arcade-style shooter doesn't make them balanced. In any game, when you balance to the average, you neglect that part of the population who will take the time needed to perfect the one-shot (or power, skill, etc.) who will still continue to dominate with over-powered weapons/abiliites, etc. This is where the accurate arcade-style shooting and movement work against you - perfecting that one-shot is 100% doable. I've met and seen plenty of people who have perfected it. For awhile, I could do it pretty well, but it felt really cheap and dirty, so I stopped. Once you master the one-shot kill, it's a joke for those who don't. Removing scope sway on snipers - terrible move, the sway at least made the one-shot kills reasonably rare but threatening. The reviver railgun of doom - terrible move. I still stuck around, despite really not liking these changes. The additional of Javelin was another change that I didn't like. What purpose does she serve? There are characters who can break-up camps, if they're not doing the job, adjust them! Instead, you put in the one-shot rocket of doom, something I was really proud of you for not putting in the game from day one. An arcade style game balanced without a rocket launcher. Ponder that. We had that.

Coming back after a long break, I wanted to see how the game progressed. I see the new characters introduced, and one of them is Hunter - he has a crossbow that can one-shot people. After playing a few games against people with Hunter, I can see once again that the higher-skilled players are STILL taking the high-damage sniper rifles, and Hunter. I used to accept being one-shot as part of the game, but I just don't want to deal with it anymore. If I want to be killed in one shot while moving around a corner, I'll play the SWAT and Rainbow 6 games - realistic shooters. Not in arcade shooters. I want teamwork, but that can't be had, because not enough abilities force you to support or rely your team. I used to think that the self-healing that all mercs have was fine, but as time went on, I found myself drawn to characters that had ""tough"" perk because I didn't need a medic. Ammo is easy to come by, generally, and rarely do you need to go far out of the way to get it, so who needs those pesky teammates? Going to get ammo shouldn't be easy, a team game should prefer you to get it from teammates, and hence punish you by having inconvenient ammo supply locations.

In case you are wondering, I don't play Overwatch. I saw enough in the videos to know that it wasn't what I was looking for. And now, very sadly, I must conclude that Dirty Bomb joins it.

Finally, I apologize for mistakes - I edited this heavily to make sure my thoughts were coordinated, but I suspect there are errors still left. | Back in 2003, Splash Damage released a standalone freeware game known as Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.  It combined the speed and movement of Quake and the hitscan and aiming mechanics of Counter-Strike into a objective-based game.  The focus on team-oriented objectives created a very popular fps game that sadly had a community die off and move on.

Splash Damage attempted to revive the series with with Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, but was largely unsucessful.

Welcome to Dirty Bomb, the newest reincarnation of the gameplay.  It feels and plays like the first legitemate sucessor to Enemy Territory.  With similar team-based classes, and a much more noob-friendly interface than ET could ever muster, this game could possibly be the first game that is a legitemate competitor to CSGO in terms of competitive FPS games... as long as Nexon doesn't FUCK everything up and make the game p2w.

The shooting mechanics combine that of quake and counter-strike.  Players are tanky and can take 2 or 3 headshots to kill.  However, similar to CS, aiming for the head is highly rewarding as most guns will kill in 8 to 10 shots (generally it takes a little less than 2 seconds to kill a player with body shots).  Additionally, you're highly accurate while moving, which makes strafe shooting a viable and effective strategy.

Don't let the cartoonish atmosphere fool you, however.  Despite its simplistic nature, there is a lot of depth to the game in taking fights, healing with medics, and even intentionally suiciding to respawn with full ammo or to defend an objective.

If you like playing competitive FPS games, give this one a fair shot.  The gameplay is quite unforgiving for new players, but highly rewarding if you stick with it. | By far my favorite FPS game on PC and one of the best i've played ever, with the added plus that it is FREEE! While it is not pay to win, it definitly requires skill and somewhat good reaction speed. It is incredibly fast paced, with battles happening across the various maps. It has a selection of 20 different mercs, with an array of abilities that include but not limited to land mines, airstrikes,and revive guns. It's devs pay close attention to their fan base and always try to respond, while keeping them up to date with every new piece added to the game. All in all, the best PC game I have played yet and it receives the highest recommendations I can give. A game worth playing :D

もう昔のゲームでちゃんとしたレビューも出そろっており、今更このストアページのレビューを覗く人なんてわずかだろう。ということでこのゲームレビューを利用して、超長文で、格ゲー世代に全く当たらずポケモン世代のアラサーの私の昨今の「格ゲー」というものに対する考え、eスポーツの「努力」に対する嫌悪感、もっと良質なゲーム「株式投資というキャラゲー」について書いていきたい。一応ゲームもレビューするがおまけ程度だ。読みたいヤツだけ読め。



現在格闘ゲームで一番話題のゲームといえば、皆さんご存じの通り『ストリートファイター6』だろう。人間的に難がある者たちを集めた我々の対戦会でも導入し、それなりに好評を得たのだが、駄菓子屋でネオジオ筐体を思う存分楽しんだけど別にガチ勢でもなんでもないただのダメな大人が多い我々の対戦会では、ストリートファイターシリーズが楽器でいう「おピアノ」ぐらいの扱いにしかならない。メジャーシーンなのは分かるが、我々にはKOFが刺さる。
TCGでいえば「MTG」対「遊戯王」みたいなものだろうか？ただ「3対3」だからというものでもない。キャラクターというものの扱い方かもしれない。最近MTGを触り始めた僕だが、MTGだってべつにキャラクターはいる。ゴブリンという「トークン出てきてなんか多人数で殴ると強い」みたいな性能設定されたキャラはいるし、チャンドラ？とかナーセット？とかいる。だが、遊戯王の青眼のストーリー性の方が日本人には強く訴えかける。『KOF98』と比較して語るであろう『ストリートファイター2X』だが、確かにキャラクターのストーリーみたいなものは色々あるかもしれないが、八神庵の「そのまま●ね！」「月を見る度思い出せ！」には勝てない。タクマ・サカザキのような、見た目だけに限ればキッズがそそられるか分からないキャラにも「覇王翔吼拳」のようなかっこいい技が用意されている。しかもスト2Xと違ってそれら超必殺技が連発して撃てる。なので

「覇王翔吼拳！」
「ガードしたぜ！楽勝！超必殺使ったし、連発はしないだろう」
「覇王翔吼拳！」
「うわ～」

と、にわかでも超必殺技でカッコいい場面が作れるのだ。
我々の対戦会のタクマが好きなY氏はKOF15でタクマが使えないのを残念ながらロバートを使っていた。が、ロバートではしっくりきていない。
そう、KOF98ではキャラに自分の魂が憑依するのだ。『バーチャーファイター2』は良いゲームでプレイヤーネームとともに当時のシーンが語られるのは有名な話だが、KOF98ではにわかでもそれができる。『ストリートファイター2X』は多分現在でも原作がプレイされており、僕はスト2では昇竜拳のコマンド入力ができないため春麗で中Kするしかないのだが、調整版であるこのULTIMATE MATCH EDITIONでは多分コマンド入力が当時より出しやすくなっている(KOFの偉大さを体験しようとまずSwitch版のNEOGEO版に向かった私は座礁したが、UMでうまくいった)。それで「ボディがあめぇぜ！」とか「サイコボール！」とか「おおお！」とかやってると、人々が戯れる明るい背景とともにホントに楽しいキャラクターゲームをやっている感じがする。それに比べてスト6やKOF15は多分背景に人が結構いなくてまさに競技的対戦が主眼に置かれてるのではないか？


昨今の動画配信やインフルエンサーのインターネット文化が流行する中、競技的なゲームひいては「努力」を支持する層が多いのは確かだし、メインストリームはそれでいいと思う。それが正しい社会である、ことを「基本的には」反対しない。だが、我々の対戦会ではそれが支持できない。それに僕には「株式投資」というもっと面白いゲームがあるから現在の競技的ゲームにはあまりそそられない。

僕(「たち」を付けれるかは分からないが)がそう思う理由を説明しよう。一般人は「努力が報われるのは良いことだと思う」し、「努力しないヤツが悪い」という。特に遊戯王的な勉強要素が強いゲームを好むプレイヤーも多いだろう。だが、「努力して失敗した」我々は違う。(我々の対戦会のおっさんの出自は全く分からないが)「会社の飲み会に出ると社会的に成功するのは別にいいけど」そこで失敗した人かもしれない。「頑張って働くために自衛隊に入ったがあまりのキツさに死んだ」人かもしれない。大多数の一般人には大丈夫かもしれないが、自分が絶望的な状況に陥いって「それでも頑張って働こう」と体を壊してまで働いた我々を、社会の人は口当たりではキレイゴトを言うが実際はゴミのような扱いをしている。そんな社会に我々は信用というものが(デスノートのキラぐらい)まるでないし、「努力」というものにはもうあまり頼れない。それでも自分なりに人生を歩み、周りの人間と関わっていかないといけない私たちに対して、昨今の競技ゲームはあまり向いていない。プロゲーマーたちのゲームシーンは素晴らしいものであり、ウメハラ氏やときど氏といったプレイヤーの人生からは学ぶことも多く、嫉妬心と尊敬心が入り混じるが、我々は彼らを追わない。有名漫画BORUTOで奈良シカマルの子どもが言ってた気がするが、我々にとってゲームは「親の目を盗んで遊ぶ」モノ、僕がKOF98UMを猛練習すれば他のメンバーと如実な差が出て勝てるかもしれないが、僕は格闘ゲームに求めているものは「勝利」だとか「金・賞品」ではなく「キャラクターになりきり、相手と格闘・組み手して、戦闘的コミュニケーションを深める」感じだ。自分でも何言ってるか分からないが。ゲームを攻略してしまうと「ゲーム体験」というより「仕事」「作業」になってしまいそうで怖い。お互い強くなれば大丈夫かもしれないが。KOF15は必殺技より通常技の方が強い、と聞く(ホントか分からないが)。それでも僕たちはKOF15でもユリやリョウで「虎煌拳」、キム・カッファンで「半月斬」をする。そっちの方がキャラクターゲーム、KOFしている気がする。

こんな昔のゲーム、今時の若者がするかは分からないが、僕たちの対戦会のS氏はKOF15でハイデルンのネックローリングがないのを残念がっていた。僕はいつもS氏に98のハイデルンで初心者殺しされるのを楽しんでいるので、KOF15になると体験が大きく変わるため(ゲイボルグも多分回復してないし)僕の対戦会では最新作よりもKOF98UMが一番人気だ。僕は98と同じ要領でできてキャラがめっちゃいて可愛い女の子を沢山使える2002UMの方が好きだが、僕以外のおじさんはコマンドの入力しづらさを指摘する(難しいというよりは、特異性がある的な？)。


それでも「努力」するゲームを求める人たちに「株式投資」というとんでもないゲームを紹介して冷やかしておきたい。僕が株式投資に魅了されているのは、格ゲーのように多彩なキャラクターが独自の性能による戦略で有利に立ち回る感じで面白いからだ。格ゲーで一般的に強いとされるのが「通常技が強く必殺技のバランス良い」キャラとされるように、「積み立てNISAで投資信託、S&P500やオルカン」「高配当株」「政府所有株」「財閥系株」といったのが世間では持てはやされてるかもしれない。しかし、僕はS&P500やオルカンといった投資信託は確かにするが個別銘柄の株式投資は世間とちょっと違うかもしれない。僕がオタクなのが最大の理由だろうが、「バンダイナムコ」とか「ほぼ日」とか「FOOD&LIFE COMPANIES(スシロー)」など実際に触れて判るものにしている。「王子HD」だの「積水ハウス」だのは名前は分かるかもしれないが、実際にどういった質の商品を出しているか僕には分かりづらい。その点、バンダイナムコは国内最大漫画雑誌である週刊少年ジャンプを利用できるのは強いだろうし、スシローも『寿司ストライカー』とのコラボキャンペーンの時に初めて行って「この値段でこの味がだせるのは、普通ありえない」と思って虚偽広告不祥事の時買った。僕のこういった考えが正しいかどうかは分からないが。ちなみに今のところ大きく勝ってるわけではないが、ちゃんと利益は出ている。
株式投資は値動きが激しい銘柄を短期保有するのもいいし、若い人は年齢を利用して安定した株を長期保有するのも良い。精神が不安定な人は放置ゲーにしてもよい。僕のようなオタクでなくても、ファッションに詳しい人だったり飲食店に詳しい人だったり、人によって強い部分が色々ある。キャラクターゲームって感じがしてくる。このゲームを始めるために、50万100万の単位で金を用意するという超大きなデメリットが存在するが、親の金でそれができる自分にはそれはどうでもいいことであった。またこう言うと「勉強という努力が必要じゃないか」と言う人もいるかもしれないが、勉強がかなり有利になるゲームだったらほとんどの東大生の職業は投資家になっていると思う。まあ、朝起きて体操するぐらいの努力は必要かもしれないが。努力したのに急に-100万円になるゲーム性を嫌う人は多いが、ローグライクで急に死ぬみたいで面白い。「努力して死んだ」僕はそういうゲームの方が納得がいく。
汗水たらさず努力しなくても、戦い方を工夫することによって立ち回っていく。僕はそういうゲームの方が好きだし、これがキャラクター的な格闘ゲームではないかと思う。僕は努力してスト6やるより努力せず株式投資している方が格闘ゲーム的なキャラクターの性能を考えて戦ってる感じで面白い。なんでみんなスマブラDXでフォックスが最強キャラだと思って「フォックス対フォックス」を夢みているのだろう。



話をこのゲームソフトに戻そう。ネット対戦だととんでもなく強い人がいて大変かもしれないが、身内でカジュアルに楽しくコミュニケーションする僕たちにはこのゲームが一番マッチしている。ゲームの造りは現代の格闘ゲームの方が完成度が高いだろうが、努力しない大味な格ゲーで救われる人たちもいるのだ。現在SNKは次回作KOF16をどうするか迷ってそうだが、クリエイターは不断の努力をしているので暖かく見守っていくことにしたい。最新の神ゲーとなる格ゲーはなんだろう…。最新である必要はあるのか…。 | 拳皇游戏的启蒙之作，在游戏厅玩过，不过我第一次玩拳皇的游戏是FLASH制作的小游戏，98是平衡性很好的一作，而且这个版本还加了很多新内容，包买的 | 輸入接收問題濫倒有剩, 莫名其妙的輸入接受延遲, 搞得 跑 > 跳/擋 接收不到, 更別說一些需要同時按兩個以上的招式"

It's quite a bit bigger than either of those examples, and much like Templar Battleforce, you could probably spend hundreds of hours optimising your crew and ship.

That said, much like Templar Battleforce, it's not remotely clear why you'd really want to do that, and there's not much in game to help you figure anything out. It is very much a Trese Brothers game, and you will love it or hate it accordingly.

I'd suggest it's a good buy at $10. Play for two hours -  just do the quest, but skip the dialog (or you won't get very far into it). It's likely you will die and not get much done, but it will give you a good feel for what the core gameplay loop is like as much of that is touched on in that first quest. | I really tried to like this game, however I can't get into it
Main problem is balance. Game is too easy or too difficult. Nothing in-between. Battle skills are useless because in easy fights you don't need them and in difficult ones - they won't save you. 
Also dice roll mechanic is complicated so it's barely understandable. Therefore the player doesn't know if one has high or low chances of success
Also in-game time flies so fast that I had feeling I barely done anything and decades already have passed.

I love this game. I've played it dozens of times and never completed it with a character because the economy is way out of balance.

76561197999482693,242680,Nuclear Throne,10.4,"Action, Indie, RPG",6,"A game that has inspired hundreds, yet a true successor has yet to arrive. Back in the day, I acquired it through not-so-legitimate means, but as soon as life changed and I had better income, I bought it without hesitation—for myself and all my friends. This game deserves every cent. | Si lees esto y es la primera vez que juegas: no te quedes en mitad de la alfombra la primera vez que llegues al trono, ponte a la derecha. De nada. Para el resto: Eyes es el mejor personaje y la mutación de meterse dentro de paredes casi indispensable para el late game. | I can't believe I've owned this game for basically over a decade and haven't given it a review.

This game is the sole reason I am the person today. Its how I met my best friend and got exposed to the fascinating world of game development and modding. If it wasn't for Nuclear Throne I wouldn't of tried my hand at so many things like art or storytelling.

That isn't to say that this game will provide the same experience for you, of course, but who knows? Its super fun and addicting and always seems to have more for people who to dig beyond the surface. It'll always hold a special place in my mutated heart | All of Vlambeer's games are great, and this one is the best. Nuclear Throne is a topdown arcade shooter with light roguelite elements. The game feel is excellent. The sound design and screenshake whenever you fire a gun accelerates the action that this game has to offer. The game incentivizes an aggressive playstyle in making ammo/health drops spawn near enemies for a limited time. While one wrong move can often cost the entire run, you also can kill everything easily.

This game can be played in two different ways. You can either reach the Nuclear Throne and see the ending. Or you can loop the game and try to go for a high score. I'd classify this game, along other games like Risk of Rain, as exponential/infinite gameplay. Where other roguelites are often a power fantasy where enemies exist to die the moment they exist; Nuclear Throne is more skill oriented. You don't get more items and become invincible by the end of the run. You can still lose at any point in time.

Both the initial experience and loop gameplay are fun for their own different reasons. Although one small criticism I have is some of the RNG that takes place in the game. Some mutations are really strong, to the extent that having a run without them feels detrimental and out of the player's control. And in some rare instances; it can also be difficult to find a decent weapon later in the game. Despite having a varied weapon pool, I keep getting screw drivers and flamethrowers well into the icy ruins.

I highly recommend this game to anyone. It's been nearly 10 years since this game released in 2015, and I still find myself coming back to it every now and then. | lots of mods, especially nuclear throne ultra"

After that it's just a matter of navigating a huge labyrinthine spaceship and destroying it piece by piece within the alloted time. Despite the monotonous and repetitive aspect, I could see this being a comfy roguelite. 
Unfortunately the game is spoiled by bad playability.

First the enemies zip around way too fast, seemingly unmarred by the laws of physic. And your projectiles are too slow to aim at them, so you can only aim in their general direction and hope they'll run into your bullets. Which is a problem when the bullets are limited.
And your own mech is often turned into a air hockey puck by the constant explosions and collisions that push you around.

Second problem is the bad visibility, in great part due to the 3D rendering baking everything into colored normal mapped lighting, and the fact everything is of the same hue. It's very difficult to tell what's a wall and what's not and most of the traps are hard to see until they start damaging you.
These two problems are compounded by the fact that the camera is moved toward your crosshair, thus greatly diminishing your environmental awareness, especially when you're in a tight spot.
Most of your deaths will be unfair deaths caused by an enemy hitting you from behind after you've been bounced around and trapped between walls and a damage zone.

The equipment you can pick up during the run is rather scarce and most of it worthless.

The ridiculous inflationary economics don't make sense and are just there to force some fake scarcity onto the run, and will provide you with even more unfair deaths. For example it happened a couple times that the game ended my run due to low money, even though I just beat the level.

In the last level (out of 5), it's very likely that he map will generate two repair systems (repairing each other) with an assortment of shuffling/failsafe/jammer systems, which means it's very unlikely you'll be able to beat it.

(It will disable achievements). It's still a fantastic cyberpunk CRPG with a XCOM like system, also comes with a lengthy post game DLC that is free. 

The game is also the most old Bioware in it's progression system and companion quests, while Dragonfall had the major elements, HK flesh them out a just enough to flesh out further. 

The true shining reason HK is the best is it's custom workshop campaigns. ""The Caldecott Caper"" and ""CalFree in Chains"" are two full sized games that use the same old Bioware like structure and are loosely connected with each other, all for no additional cost and are purely fan made. 

There is also Vox Populi, a custom campaign that back ported the first Shadowrun returns game in full plus companions and companion quests, again, for free. 

This entire trilogy goes on deep sale quite often, it's a no brainer to grab all of them when it happens, but HK is very likely the one you invest the most time in. | Best experience in the Shadowrun series and an exceptionally good crpg.

76561197999482693,266510,Hand of Fate,2.3833333333333333,"Action, Indie, RPG",4,"As with HoF2, Hand of Fate delivers an unprecedented and unique mix between deckbuilder, dungeon crawler, and action RPG. Also as with HoF2, there are glaring flaws in the implementation of mechanics, this time particularly with the Chance Card game and the action RPG combat itself.  
My issue with the Chance Cards is that it is the only minigame you have available to you. HoF2 rectifies this by introducing several others that aren't almost entirely RNG or perception-based: some moreso, some less so, but it all balances out. You also have a greater variety of equipment for dealing with or ""gaming"" certain minigame types. Hand of Fate has maybe two pieces of equipment that will help contribute to your success at Chance Cards.  
The action RPG combat is by far the WORST part of the game. While it's fluid and more dynamic (more options) in HoF2, HoF's combat is plagued by HORRIBLE camera movement and maneuverability of character. Too many times have I gotten stuck on a piece of terrain, surrounded by multiple enemies, and stunlocked by unavoidable attacks. On top of that, enemy HP feels much tankier than HoF2, which draws out combat encounters long enough that I began to feel the game was no longer respecting my time.  
Altogether, at this point in the game's life, I would have to say skip this one and try out HoF2 instead. While that entry has its own share of problematic features, they are not insurmountable, and the breadth of equipment and card types available allow you to take a more tailored approach towards the game's various encounters and challenges.  
Edit: Another thing I wanted to touch on is how some of the token chains for encounter cards feel REALLY unbalanced, requiring you to either repeatedly draw and complete the card's challenge with increasing requirements AND harder Chance Cards, or complete at least three Chance Card challenges with success or Huge Success. This is frustrating and a huge turn-off, but what I've come to understand is Defiant Development LOVES implementing things like this, as they were complained about also by users when HoF2 was fresh, and some things had to be nerfed. Engage with these cards at your own risk of sanity. | O jogo em si é bem legal, Já a platina é cansativa pra porra | очень интересная задумка, хорошая реализация, но ты умрёшь. тебя убьёт либо тупость героя, когда вместо того, чтобы атаковать стоящего рядом врага, герой начнёт давать пощёчины лежащему телу, пока ему уже летит топор, чтобы расколоть пустую черепушку, либо голод , потому что толпа крестьян не взяла половину еды и забрала всё, харкнув тебе в рожу, или же ты умрёшь чисто по приколу, потому что  тебе из-за экрана кинули сквозь тела стоящих противников нож, который ты не смог парировать, ведь щит у тебя слямзили два события назад , когда ты бухал с очень сильной, очень независимой, но очень несчастной алкоголичкой | Really good and really hard.

Данная игра взяла всё лучшее от старшей части, внеся некоторые изменения в геймплей. Проходится довольно быстро, в связи с чем не успевает надоесть. Так что советую всем к ознакомлению. | [h1] Introduction [/h1]
Wolfenstein: The Old Blood is the prequel to TNO, set sometime just before the prologue of the game, where Blazkowicz and Agent One undertake a mission to recover a top secret folder containing information that can change the tide of the war.

[h1] Positives [/h1]
[list]
    [*]This game to me is more of an ""expansion pack"" if you will, as it's a lot shorter than TNO, taking only about 4 hours for me to complete, which is a good thing!

    [*]The only game in the new saga where Blazkowicz actually talks in moment to moment gameplay - Usually it's always him talking in monologue and in cutscenes, but never in gameplay, which I found to be really cool. I'm surprised that they scrapped this in TNC, makes no sense to me

    [*]Loved that this game is basically the same narrative as Return to Castle Wolfenstein, just told differently. To me, it feels more like a remake of that game, despite having some differences, like the zombies not being knights and having swords and shields or the lack of Elite Guards

    [*]Combat and stealth is pretty much cookie cutter from TNO, don't expect anything crazy here. The nice addition of weapons, like the Bolt-Action Rifle and the explosive grenade pistol added some much needed variety. I couldn't get enough of one tapping enemies in the head with the sniper, had that ""oomph"" feeling

    [*]The pipe climbing was something that I hated at first because of how its handled on mouse and keyboard, but I learnt to love it after a while

    [*]The level design is top notch, I'd argue it's better than New Order! More killing and getting up in your face, something that game lacked

    [*]Runs great out of the box and still looks good to this day - Castle Wolfenstein has never looked better
[/list]

[h1] Negatives [/h1]
[list]
    [*]Lack of graphical options - I'm not the biggest fan of Depth of Field or Film Grain in games and I found it annoying that I couldn't turn it off in the game's settings. You can probably edit this in the game's ini files or something, but I shouldn't have to go through that just to turn a few things off. DoF only had a medium setting and it made it look arguably worse in my experience, so I just kept it on high

    [*]Locked to 60 FPS - Thankfully there's a way to unlock the frame rate with a tool called id5 Tweaker, but it can cause issues. Something to note, but doesn't take away from the whole experience
[/list]

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
Keeping this review short since the game is short, but Wolfenstein: The Old Blood is a great addition to the Wolfenstein Universe and is just... more Wolfenstein, with some flashbacks to RTCW in terms of its story and simple yet fun gameplay. | The Old Blood is the back-to-basics prequel to TNO: traditional, straightforward weapons, enemies, and gameplay mechanics that any FPS player will be very familiar with. It's an exhibition of the strong fundamental bones underneath the new Wolfenstein series. TOB is a very fun game, and an easy recommend, and though I'll make note of some software issues, virtually none of its flaws have to do with game design. The story is a bit cliched, but so snappy that it doesn't really matter, and the flavor of Rudi Jaeger's chapters shine brightly enough to carry the whole game. 

The guns are GREAT. The guns are maybe the best in all of new Wolfenstein. It's your standard FPS armory: pistol, rifle, shotgun, sniper, rocket launcher, and it's all basically polished to perfection. Even the DOOM reboot series had to add bells and whistles to its armory, but The Old Blood presents them in a basically unadorned form, aside from crafting excellent sound design and balancing (the extremely powerful MG might be an exception to this part). 

Although it's a brief game (5-6 hours), you'll get your money's worth, assuming you wait until the game goes on sale for FOUR DOLLARS, and more than your money's worth if you like the combat enough to hit the challenges. They're basically isolated combat sequences from the campaign, and while I would rather have seen a proper challenge mode with unique designs, anything it offers to increase the firefight density is welcome when the FPS fundamentals are this good. 

Now it's time to talk about the less than good: this is not a well-maintained piece of software. High framerates breaks one of the firing modes of the AR (and harmlessly alter ragdoll physics), I've had sound output detection issues, borderless fullscreen issues, etc, and the first two hours of revisiting this game consisted of bugfixes rather than getting into Billy Boy's blood-soaked shoes. Two of the weapons in the game don't even have keybinds, and the slide inputs are pretty iffy if you don't use toggle crouch/sprint. But, once you find a solution to these issues (and I did solve most of my issues), there is a great, inexpensive game here waiting for you. | I think it's a good if not really enjoyable singleplayer game despite being an older game and having some things that I personally don't like about it. Like I'm not particularly a fan of the drawn out boss fights in all honesty with mechanics that you have to like ""brute-force"" or ""trial and attempt"" through in order to figure out what needs to be done but they do add to the experience and charm of the games.

Like, I like design wise the realistic looking levels a lot and enemies that even through technological upgrades still seem plausible but I am also not a huge fan of how the weapons look for instance but they are functional so it's okay I guess.

Truth is I really always loved the Wolfenstein games since the first game which I always used to watch briefly people play, grown ups with their darn PC's and having started to really play the game from Return to Castle Wolfenstein onward I always thought that there was something about these Wolfenstein games that is really appealing in nature. Not just because they have a cool name and belong to a series of epic and often original games that go beyond just Wolfenstein franchise. For instance with the original game it was the fact that it was a shooter in the time that usually people played platformer games or 2D adventure / action games is something that made it stand out to me. Ever since RTCW and its multiplayer counterpart which I really enjoyed which was a little bit like Team Fortress with different classes and different gear kits. Things like a medic and a spy and so on was really great. An aspect that always appealed to me and one what makes these games stand out to me is the dark.

Darkness of these games has a lot to do with the story where Europe is divided and the whole world has basically fallen to the enemies influence and it combines this idea with the technological aspect that really makes it a scary reality and thought but the dark of the game also has to do with the atmosphere and levels of the game which are enjoyable in this morbid sense of basically there being danger around every corner of the game where you change between different play styles alternating from at times pretty intense like suspenseful stealth to like all out action combat and that is also something I enjoy about the game that it gives you this opportunity to stealth until you take out the able-to-call-in-the-reinforcements commanders found in some areas (which is a really cool addition to the game) and then are able to apply more force as you progress through a level or have to go loud as you find more dangerous and difficult enemies so there are like aspects of the game that mix things up gameplay wise and I like that because even though it's a pretty linear shooter with I'd say some hidden areas where you have to explore the levels thoroughly if you want to find everything they hide the way that you play it really is immersive in essence.

Game has elements of world exposition through various lore found in the game not just through cutscenes but also usually in levels through found documents which you have to take the time to read if you want to get up to date but I really found some other games like NecroVisioN to do this aspect a little bit better because if you would open a document in game, a voice actor would read it out loud and you could even close the document and move on in the game continuing to play it and then it would still be read out loud in often heavily accented language which also I think adds to the immersion, conviction and convenience because personally and on a side note when I'm playing an action oriented game be that a shooter or even to some extent an (A)RPG, what have you, having to pause my gameplay to actually read is something I found that I won't do often even though I admit sounding pretty stupid because of that, but regardless. It's like a flow breaking like interrupting endeavor that I don't mind being there but it could have been done a little better I think.

Wolfenstein games have to me always been enjoyable because of the dark and the grim atmosphere they provide with elements from storytelling and the setting and the gameplay and the game's themes and I have always liked to take my time and to enjoy these games because of that and because they are pretty much singleplayer action/story driven games that I appreciate playing because I can choose to take a brake from them, go do or play something else and then over time return to the world.

One more aspect I also like (a lot) is Blaskowicz banter when the player is traversing levels where he reminisces at times about the past or thoughts that he has where he'd like sort of whisper some lines about his life, thinking of the better times. It's some details like this that these games come really close to being immersive sims of sorts which are really my favorite types of games because of many reasons.

I'm playing this one at 144 fps and I'm really glad that the game has the ability even though having to be modded for this externally, and sometimes I'd have to revert back to its 60 fps standard as to be able to advance through some areas of the game but this is something I have to do but a few times and so in that sense I'm really enjoying my time playing it and you should too I think if you like the idea of such a game as I've attempted to describe here.

Truth is we have come relatively a long way from RTCW and NecroVisioN and sometimes I harken back to those moments lost in time where games had some sort of notion of having a soul to them and here is hoping that in the future still games will be made that contain traces of one and I think Wolfenstein games certainly have the character to categorize them as such, enjoyable singleplayer games with some good degree of substance through various ways. 

Games with a soul."
76561197999482693,291650,Pillars of Eternity,6.166666666666667,RPG,3,"Pillars of Eternity is an outstanding throwback to the golden age of RPGs, successfully blending rich storytelling, intricate world-building, and deep character customization. From the very first moments, you're immersed in a beautifully crafted world full of history, intrigue, and lore that feels alive and vibrant. The developers at Obsidian have clearly poured their hearts into creating a game that doesn’t just tell a story, but invites you to shape it through meaningful choices and engaging dialogue.

The combat system is a perfect mix of strategy and real-time action, offering a tactical challenge that feels rewarding. The diverse range of abilities and character builds ensures that no two playthroughs are the same. There's also a level of depth in how you interact with the world—everything from your party's backstories to the lore of the land is fleshed out and the consequences of your actions reverberate throughout the entire game.

The narrative in Pillars of Eternity is a true highlight. The game handles themes of life, death, reincarnation and the nature of the soul with nuance and sophistication while presenting a world that feels lived-in and grounded. The overarching story is truly gripping with rich dialogues making each interaction feel impactful.

Graphically, the game uses a beautiful,  hand drawn isometric art style that makes the world feel both timeless and distinct, reminiscent of old classic RPGs like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape: Torment. The environments are detailed, and the use of lighting and atmosphere brings the world to a higher level. Its art direction more than compensates for any technical shortcomings.

Overall, Pillars of Eternity is a must-play for fans of old school cRPGs, or anyone who loves a good story paired with a deeply immersive world. With a vast, intricate world to explore, tactical combat to master, and an engaging narrative that constantly rewards exploration, it’s a game that stands the test of time and remains one of my favorite RPGs of the last decade. | Masterpiece unfortunately hidden behind a slow and uninteresting start. Top notch world, characters, and story, with a mostly good real time with pause combat system behind it. This feels like the real spiritual successor to the Baldur's Gate games, unlike the actual BG3 which is more akin to a Dragon Age Origins. I played this directly after BG1 and was actually shocked at how faithful Pillars feels to those games. I'm gonna give this five big booms on the boom meter. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! | The world that Obsidian built is great, the main quest, the side-quests, everything ties in very well and feels like a cohesive piece of art.

Where the game fails a bit is the game-play. During combat it's hard to track what is happening, and even though I completed a game, I never felt confident and as if I mastered the game's mechanics. Something that is usually a reward itself in crpgs.
The art-style left a bit confused, on one side, the game is beautiful, on the other it was so hard for me to discern characters from the background, or even one character from the other. In many encounters I couldn't figure out where each companion stands, and I had to rely only on their avatars.
Also, the story deliver and a bunch of text, lore and hard-to-remember names made the game much harder to enjoy.

Once it all settles down in your mind, you can enjoy it more. I almost feel bad that I played this game now after the resurgence of crpgs, because I feel time-pressure to play all those games (Pathfinder, Deadfire, D:OS). If I played this game when it came out, I'm sure I would've played it at much slower pace and gave myself more time to learn all the mechanics and read every sentence that was written. But this is on me, nothing is stopping me to do this right now. | 游戏里rp死神嗣被贝拉斯讨债，游戏外在延伸白茫冻得倒欠3万字。

- Satisfying Left 4 Dead inspired gameplay.
- Fun co-op.
- There’s a good amount of class and weapon variety.
- Despite taking lots of inspiration from Left 4 Dead, it has enough features and mechanics to make it feel unique.
- Challenging gameplay.
- Has a solid main campaign as well as a Last Stand wave based survival mode.
- Snowy maps have snow covered models for vermin which is a nice detail.
- The DLC maps are solid.
- Goes on pretty good sales.

- Okay graphics and art style. Some of it looks good, but some looks a bit cheap.
- Inconsistent quality. Some levels feel really solid and polished, others can feel a bit rough.
- The story is pretty minimal and only exists to push along the gameplay. Not necessarily a bad thing, but don’t expect much plot.
- Mediocre optimization. It doesn’t run terribly, but you would expect higher performance given the dated graphics.

[h3][Negatives][/h3]
- The game is online-only.
-  Playing solo isn’t actually offline. You won’t be able to pause and if you lose connection, you’ll be booted from your game.
- The team AI is terrible. They constantly get stuck, they don’t have quick reflexes, they won’t always prioritize helping players, etc.
- The game doesn’t do the best job at explaining some of it’s mechanics.
- The loot system is very RNG and grindy.
- It could use more polish. There’s some areas where you can see out of bounds into the void.
- A few missions aren’t great.
-  $30 is too expensive for what it is.

7/10 | Also ich habe jetzt nicht viele Spielstunden, jedoch muss ich leider sagen: ich konnte das Game auch nicht wirklich zocken. Es gibt keine Spieler die dieses Game noch zocken. Ich warte jetzt seit 3/4 meiner Spielzeit in der Warteschlange und habe alle anfangs Maps gesucht, auf jeder Schwierigkeit. Wer sich dieses Game für den normal Preis kauft, der wird es bereuen. Für Co-op mit Freunden kann man das bestimmt paar runden daddeln (aber auch keine Ewigkeit) Wenn man solo in einer Warteschlange rum hockt und nicht einmal das Spiel spielen kann, dann ist es einfach nur Betrug und abzocke, das Game für den vollen Preis zu kaufen.

The game has a pretty steep learning curve, does not hold your hand, or offer much in the form of guidance.  But it is oh so rewarding when you do get the hang of it and are able to take on the more challenging battles the game has to offer.

My favorite Turn-Based Strategy game ever.  If you're on the fence, play this and profit. | This game is the equivalent of your abusive uncle that somehow always comes back to the family gathering. An average game looks like this:
-Start a new company with a cool name, a dope banner, and even some backstory in mind
-Go into the first town that has strangled trade routes, has been raided recently, and is somehow inhabited by exclusively anti-sellsword activists
-Get your first contract
-Get decapitated by a graverobber high on hyena acid

10/10 would visit the abusive uncle again. | A very fun and equally frustrating game. I cannot stress enough how much I recommend starting on the beginner difficulty, otherwise there is a high chance you will rage quit and conclude that the game is poorly balanced. Even on beginner, there will be times where it feels like the RNG is legitimately out to get you, but other times it feels like a miracle how much it seems to be in your favor. 

It's a hard game and you will likely find yourself reloading saves but its also a quite well made and in depth turn based combat game. It feels very rewarding as you evolve from a group of losers barely scraping by to a small army full of hardened combatants. | This game is pretty much turn based mount and blade, which is not really a good thing. Like M&B, I had fun for awhile, until i realized that there is nothing tactical about the game and every battle becomes pretty repetitive. The game starts every battle with your sides in two lines within almost one turns movement distance. Very tactical. I know I would deploy my guys right up there within range of archers. The terrain for each battle is generated upon entering the battle, so you may start the battle with your back against a hill. Did my guys march right down a hill and start battle at the foot of the hill my enemies are on. Very Tactical. The game kind of treats armor and shields as a second health bar, so it just becomes swinging attrition. The only bonus you get for placement of troops is a mild accuracy bonus. Mild. So you surround a guy with a shield and he somehow blocks every swing with a shield until the shield is destroyed. Then do the same for armor. Tactical as hell. Yes some weapons deal more damage to shields or armor, but ultimately it is still a very shallow ""tactical"" experience. | Fun Game! Challenging, with a learning curve to it. Not crazy though. On the surface seems simple, but takes some time to learn the depth. I am still getting the hang of it. If you like turn based games, with depth, then this is the game for you."

Even so, there's still lots of content and replayability here, not to mention all the steam workshop content. So many interesting planes, weapons, and builds you can try out in a fun arcadey gameplay loop. Co-op is unfortunately local only which means having to use steam remote play and has some jank (like mouse flight not working in co-op) but is otherwise a blast if you can make it work.

推荐打折入。 | I'm giving it a negative but only to highlight my problems with the game; it's not a bad game in itself; everything works, but it's lacking in gameplay for me. 
First thing that stands out; controler works, but there is too much things to assign, so you will have to compromise on sth - I did target tracking and targeting on the same button. In tutorial buttons shown on screen won't even match the default settings (still controller, it works on M&K afaik).
Flying feels like you pretend to fly your toy plane as a kid; I don't feel any momentum, it's super easy to stall and ruin your maneuvers; it may sound weird, but it's almost like controlls are too reponsive. Also, a dedicated dodge button? For me it highlights that controlls just aren't good and its a bandaid sollution. After playing games like Ace Combat and Project Wingman I may have a little too big expectations, but there are fun, arcade flying games that feel good and this one just doesn't cut it for me. Then again, it's a finished game and you may enjoy this VERY arcade-y flying model, so if you have money to spare, why not. | masterpiece"

游戏里的屠杀结局，是对人性黑暗面的直白审视。在这个走向里，玩家选择对遇到的怪物赶尽杀绝，每一次攻击都伴随着怪物的痛苦与绝望。游戏画面随着杀戮推进，逐渐染上压抑的色调，音乐也变得扭曲阴森。最终，玩家会面对一个孤独且荒芜的世界，曾经生机勃勃的地下王国沦为死寂废墟，只剩无尽悔恨与空虚。这个结局以极端的方式警示玩家，暴力与冷漠只会带来毁灭，让我们反思自身行为对周围世界的影响。
 
和平路线则截然不同，它是一曲爱与理解的赞歌。玩家摒弃武器，用耐心、真诚与怪物交流，挖掘出每个角色背后温暖人心的故事。游戏氛围也从最初的紧张转为温馨，音乐轻快明亮，充满希望。在这个结局中，玩家不仅化解了怪物与人类之间的千年仇恨，还让地下世界重归安宁与和谐。它向我们展示了善良、包容的力量，让我们坚信爱能跨越一切障碍。
 
中立结局处于二者之间，充满了未知与变数。玩家的每一次抉择都可能改变故事走向，怪物的命运在玩家一念之间或喜或悲。这一结局凸显了游戏的自由与开放，强调玩家的选择具有决定性意义，每个人都能在游戏中书写属于自己的独特篇章。
 
《传说之下》通过三种结局，为玩家带来了丰富的情感体验与深刻的人生思考。它证明了游戏不仅是娱乐，更是一种强大的叙事与表达媒介，值得每一位热爱游戏的玩家深入探索。 | [h1]One of the first games I've ever played and is such an experience.[/h1]

Turns out, up to this date, it is still the most enjoyable game I've ever played and I'll forever be a fan of such a wonderful piece of artwork in the gaming community. | ---{ Графика }-—

Factions all have really strong flavor and personality, so it's nice to just catch a vibe with. Definitely recommended if you're into Stellaris but don't always have the mental bandwidth to create your own roleplay as you go. Turn-based as well, adding to the chill factor. All-around solid game. | One of my favorite games ever. 

Pros:
+ Visuals are eye candy. Smooth and pleasing.
+ Music is ear candy. One of the absolute best soundtracks I have heard from a game.
+ The game-play is very fun, a little overwhelming at first but then it all falls into place.
+ It's turn-base and while not really a plus, I know some folks enjoy calculating their every move unlike RTS.
+ Unlike Stellaris, (another goat) this game has some pretty good lore. 

Cons:
- I HATE HACKING, I DON'T CARE FOR IT, TAKE IT AWAY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD | [h2] Endless Space 2 - Наследница первой пробы пера [/h2]
[i] Я начинал свой путь еще с Endless Space 1 и Endless Space 2 является достойным продолжением вселенной Endless. Участвовал в бета тесте игры и активностях на форуме разработчиков (Таких как выбор внешности некоторых фракций - Несгибаемые и Хор Теней). У игры был долгий путь разработки и она стала результатом трудов, в том числе, многих фанатов вселенной Endless. Что получилось в итоге? [/i]
[h2] За что стоит ее любить эту игру [/h2] 
[list]
    [*][i] Фракции - каждая фракция уникальна, любой игрок сможет выбрать фракцию на свой вкус. Некоторые перекочевали из первой части, но еще больше новых. Основных фракций восемь (без дополнений). Каждая фракция имеет свой сюжет и приличное количество заданий, что помогут познакомиться с ними поближе. 
Например, хочешь быть безумным ученым? Софоны будут тебе по душе, а внешне они напоминают причудливых зеленых человечков. 
Думаешь, что путь к победе, это развитие промышленности и влияние? Единая империя (Местное человечество) идет по этому пути, но даже этот путь ты сможешь изменить. Остаться на пути промышленности, стать ученым или наращивать военную мощь? Ты сможешь принимать судьбоносные решения. [/i]
    [*][i] Геймплей - По сравнению с Endless Space 1 и Endless Legend, расширили и сделали глубже все элементы 4х-стратегий. 
Прохождение основного сюжета поведает вам Академии, космической гильдии героев и ее лидере. Наличие множества побочных заданий, наткнуться на которые ты сможешь просто исследуя мир. Без преувеличения, интересное исследование бескрайнего космоса, где даже исследование странного сигнала на планете, может привести к неожиданному результату. 
Изучение различных веток технологий, от возможности колонизации неприветливых миров до постройки огромных военных крейсеров. Колонизация новых миров и их развитие, в том числе уникальных планет, что были оставлены древней, более развитой расой. Огромное количество торговых и дипломатических возможностей, от покупки ценных ресурсов до заключения альянса между империями. И самые проработанные и захватывающие космические сражения, лучшие в своем жанре. [/i]
    [*][i] Графика - Начиная с главного меню и заканчивая роликом победы одной из фракций, все что вы уведите, будет выглядеть волшебно и завораживающе. Эта игра подарит вам ощущение бескрайнего и неизведанного, местами причудливого космоса (Как на счет фракции высокоразвитых деревьев или роботов, что больше напоминают насекомых поглощающих все на своем пути?). Каждый арт, каждый ролик или эффект от взрыва планеты выполнен на недосягаемо качественном уровне. На мой личный взгляд, в этой игре космос выполнен лучше всего и крупные франшизы, такие как Mass Effect или Star Wars не передают даже крупицы этой красоты. [/i]
    [*][i] Музыка Endless Space 2 - это шедевр, который погружает вас в атмосферу космоса и подчеркивает эпичность происходящего. Композитор Arnaud Roy создал великолепный саундтрек, который идеально сочетается с визуальным стилем игры и подчёркивает уникальность каждой фракции. Музыка разнообразна и эмоциональна. Здесь вы услышите эпические и величественные мелодии, которые сопровождают ваши великие открытия и завоевания, а также более спокойные и лирические треки, которые звучат во время мирного развития империи. [/i]
[/list]
[h2] К сожалению есть и ложка дёгтя в этой бочке мёда [/h2]
[list]
    [*][i] Порог вхождения и интерфейс - как в любой 4х-стратегии это вызов для игрока. Разобраться в механиках игры может быть сложно. В игре есть обучение, но к сожалению оно не столь подробное и даже после его прохождения могут остаться вопросы. Интерфейс игры - это лабиринт из различных вкладок и информации (В том числе сокращений по типу ""5П"", которые не сразу будут ясны новому игроку.). На первый взгляд он выглядит запутанным, но со временем вы привыкнете к нему. К счастью, он не такой перегруженный как в Stellaris. [/i]
    [*][i] Искусственный интеллект - иногда принимает странные решения. К примеру, ты накопил много Пыли (Местная валюта), он может предложить отдать все. С какой радости? Но в целом, он достаточно умен, чтобы бросить вам вызов. [/i]
    [*][i] Дополнения к игре запишу скорее в минусы, так как выходят сомнительными через один. Особенно вызывают вопросы такие дополнения как - Supremacy и Awakening. Подробнее о них расскажу в отдельных обзорах. [/i]
[/list]

[b] Вывод: [/b] [i] Играя Endless Space 2 ты забываешь о времени и погружаешься в мир космических приключений. Как и в любой 4х-стратегии, ты можешь сесть за нее и спустя десяток часов осознать, что провел весь день в этом мире. Она не идеальна, но её достоинства с лихвой перекрывают недостатки. Некоторые недостатки можно исправить, к примеру починить ИИ, в мастерской есть моды, что отлично справляются с этим. Но если ты решил поиграть с друзьями, то этот недостаток не будет заметен вовсе. Если вы любите космос и стратегии, то Endless Space 2 - это ваш выбор <З [/i] | 戦闘は陣形を設定したらあとは見てるだけだがそれが良い

[h1]OY. YOU. READING THE REVIEWS![/h1]
 Listen to the most recent ones telling you not to buy the game! At least for now! 

Let us begin by telling you a brief summary; before certain excruciating circumstances, the game was okay. Playable, functional, even kind of fun with the Secondary Movement System 'skates.' Admittedly kind of dead, and as a result a pain to play against the bots, but I could have just been bad at tuning the Gears or playing the game.

[h1]BUT THEN AS YOU MIGHT HAVE READ IN OTHER REVIEWS:[/h1]
 the devs were apparently canned. Funding; lost. It's no longer being worked on. And until now there's no way for the game's owners to get at the servers. [strike]Until now, the meatbags whom now own the game or the company or what have you haven't done the right thing and either got on Steam to take this game down, or told Valve themselves to take it down for them because right now this is just blatantly dishonest to sell a game, even one in Early Access, when no one can even PLAY it.[/strike]*

[strike][h1]REPEAT: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.[/h1] 
...y'know, I wasn't sure if I even needed to leave a review back then. I wanted to wait and see if anything would change. Day this review came up I did try getting into the game but I couldn't. And you know what, if this review is enough to get the game's score down just enough to negative and give someone more pause for thought if they stumble upon this game in the store? Then that's fine with me.[/strike]*

*you can no longer buy the game at all it seems, thankfully. | I've been watching this game since it opened up for sale on steam when it initially opened up for purchase.  It has turned into a complete and utter failure.

Жаль что проект умер.... | Fun space sim!"
76561197999482693,420520,Lost Technology,0.1,"Indie, Simulation",0,"This game is an absolute steal at the price point it's sold at. The mix of the turn-based strategy map and real time tactics battles works like Total War, but if you play the story mode (called Prologue in the mode selection) the game goes through a lot of story events, which reminds me of the Nobunaga's Ambition series. However, if you don't like that and would prefer a more sandbox way of playing the game with no events or stories, you can just play Free Mode or Random Scenario. The game is very simple but fun, however I feel like the UI is very confusing and unintuitive and takes some time getting used to. The balance can also feel a bit lopsided, I don't expect perfection but the elf faction feels really weak while the musket and lizardmen factions feel brainlessly simple to play. Still, the variety on display is really good. Not only do you have a good variety of factions, but recruiting heroes from other nations allows you to recruit units from their faction for that commander and best of all there are some heroes that start off neutral that have completely unique recruitment pools. | An absolutely incredible game.
There are two distinct aspects of its appeal, which some folks enjoy both of: the story, and the gameplay, each of which is incredible in its own right, though the gameplay/combat isn't necessarily everyone's cup of tea.
The gameplay is basically in the style of a total war game, of grand strategy level unit deployment mixed with rts-style fights using those units. However, unlike in the total war series, including the total war warhammer titles, this game's high-fantasy in its combat. This means that, though melee combat and ranged weapons are undoubtedly relevant, it has quite a bit of magic that wipe out large chunks of an army, in the case of an especially high level mage or some other character with a very strong technique. Thus, like with a fair few other moderately old or more indie-ish strategy games, you need to think not just in terms of unit deployment, yet also in the sense of a magical rock-paper-scissors-carbomb-tank.
Unit deployment also is nowhere near as spatially restricted as in the total war series, as redeploying troops for defending on that turn, or to prepare for attacking the following turn, can be across any length of connected territory you own, meaning the grand strategy side of it is less central than in the total war series in some ways. However, as encirclements can occur, wherein a territory with no retreat path is conquered from a faction and causes the retirement of any heroes the other faction had there, in another sense it is even more necessary to pay attention to the particular provinces units are deployed in before hitting the ""end turn"" button, as well as when planning offensives. Terrain also plays a quite major role in combat, as lizards aren't especially fast in deserts or atop snowy mountains, yet nor are horses especially fast swimmers if combat takes place in a sea and can be slowed down considerably by swampy marshes.
Units, in combat, act using abilities, which you can choose to prioritize the use of or disable if desired. This gives a lot of ability to customize how exactly you want a certain unit to fight, which can be rather necessary in some cases, as, unfortunately, the combat ai doesn't tend to use certain skills unless explicitly told, and at times chooses to use some fairly sub-optimal options. How exactly to read what an ability does also isn't very intuitive at first glance, yet, with time, one can piece together how to decipher what an ability does (though, as a tip in advance for anyone who tries out water magic and comes to the impression basic water mages are quite weak: the bubbles can block some types of projectiles, and can be point-targeted).
On the whole, I quite like this style of gameplay, yet understand it isn't necessarily for everyone, and even may deter some who mainly play strategy games, yet are more used to ones which aim for modest power levels.
The biggest selling point of Lost Technology, though, above the mechanics I quite enjoy, is the story. Each of the factions has incredibly well written characters, who you learn more about not only through their own campaign, yet also by interactions that occur in other factions' campaigns. With time, you get a sense of the world's lore as well, of why exactly there are so many technologies that have, by and large, been lost to time, and why some would prefer they remain as such. 
Each of the factions has quite different underlying goals for why they fight as well. Some desire power, others seek to bring about a more peaceful existence for all, some expand their borders out of curiosity or in pursuit of love, and others seek mere survival, whether their own or that of a companion they hold dear. The range between characters and factions can go from quite sombre or tragic, to, in other cases, fairly humorous or lighthearted, all the while still feeling quite in keeping with the world as a whole.
One note of caution, though, is that its saves are local, rather than to the cloud. This only really is of relevance if you leave a campaign unfinished, when each faction's campaign usually can be completed in under 20 hrs fairly easily, often under 10 when one is used to the mechanics, or if going for the rogue-like-esque dungeon crawling mode, which isn't really the main draw of the game in my view.
To conclude, the sheer quality of storytelling could alone justify this game being among the best I have played. Thus, I strongly recommend giving this game a try, especially given its very low price, which gets even lower when it somewhat frequently goes on sale. | オススメしないとは付けているが、ゲームとしては十分面白い。
なので、「万人にはオススメしない」と思って欲しい。
根幹のシステムは既に完成している（元々根幹はヴァーレントゥーガがベースな）ので、問題なくプレイ可能。

一番の問題点は、永遠に未完の完成品……とでも言えばいいのだろうか？
メインのシナリオが、序章で未完のままだったりする。
さらに開発者が話の続きを作る気がないと言える状態の為、メインのシナリオの完成は絶望的。
（一応「マスケット」という勢力が、次の章へと続くメインストーリー……のはずなのだが、飛行出来る部隊しか侵入出来ないという厄介な仕様の浮遊城や、メンバー固定で挑む専用の長いラストダンジョンを攻略させられた果てに、バッドエンドとしか言いようのない中途半端な所で終了するストレスフルな展開なので、クリアしてもスッキリしたりはしない。その為、いわゆるハッピーエンドな展開が好みの人は触れない方が良い）
要するに途中まで気合入れて作ったけれど、力尽きてしまった残念なゲーム。

まぁ、そんなシナリオなど最初からなかった事にすれば、一昔前のオールドスタイル国盗りゲーとして普通にプレイ可能。
国盗りゲーとして遊ぶのならフリーモードとかで十分。

ただし、これはオールドスタイルであるが故の問題点となるが、全てが一昔前の物なので、ユーザーインターフェースや操作性には難がありまくる。
最近のゲームのように見やすいとか操作しやすいとかとは無縁だと思った方が良い。

要するに、昔ヴァーレントゥーガ系をやった人向けのゲーム……といった所。
なので、現状では一番最初に書いた通り、万人にはオススメ出来ない。

しかし、根幹のシステムがしっかりしている為、問題点を認識して理解した上でプレイすれば十分に楽しめるであろう。
ちゃんと最後の章まで作られれば、オススメにするのだが……その日が来る事はあるのだろうか。 | A Japanese total war where you get to control a faction and fight to unite the world under your banner

Pro:
>A really diverse cast of characters, voiced with their own background lore
+
>a solid RTS game with lots of builds/combinations to try out

>a roguelike dungeon mod


Cons:
>Really outdated control scheme lacking basic hotkeys like ctrl+1, 2, 3 to designate armies

>Questionable character maturity or motives 
e.g. murder hoboing everyone because the leader likes democracy and women's rights
e.g. a team of archaeologists and treasure hunters waging a total war against the world because they found muskets? 

>railroaded ""bad ending""
Your victory sometimes have bad implication for the world/faction. And there is nothing you can do about it. 

>Final boss/battle involves unassailable floating fortress where 99% of the units in this game cannot even reach.

I would give 10/10 | After my 3rd attempt, I was able to beat this game, and I didn't really like it. The game is cruel, unreasonably hard and very disrespectful to player. 
At first, the game bombards you with a ton of non-skippable events, missions, messages. While you trying to figure out what's going on, they put on a timer on you with this ""Project Avatar"" thing, and you immediately feel a lot of pressure. Some missions are just crazy difficult, like those for Serpent King and Mad AI factory, and you don't expect this difficulty this early in the game.
Mid-game you finally have a chance to catch some breath and start working on some research, building and engineering, but here's the catch: the moment you get better in the game, the moment you upgrade your weapons and armour, the enemies suddenly become more powerful and armoured. You just don't have a chance to enjoy powerful things that you've made, because they quickly become just what is expected by default.
The end game comes unexpectedly, with a lot of pressure on you. It consists of two consecutive missions with no pause in between. If you got some units damaged in the first mission, you either will have to replace your best units or send them in wounded. The final mission is crazy, the amount of extremely powerful enemies is over the top, and it carries a lot of stress.
Given that the game is flawed with bugs in controls, has dumb battle mechanics that lead to absurd situations and very challenging overall even on lower difficulties, I would not recommend this game. | XCOM2の面白さを語るには、前作にして名作 XCOM: Enemy Unknown (以下XCOM:EU) と比較すると分かりやすいと思う

まず前作のXCOM:EUからあらゆる面で順当に進化しておりボリュームも増した
Steamワークショップ対応でMODも充実と欠点なし！と、損は無いのでセール時にはぜひ買ってプレイしてほしい

以上を大前提とした上で、そう⋯700時間以上もプレイ（最高難易度を最小部隊人数でクリア済）した上で私個人の見解を言わせてもらうと
XCOM:EUよりもゲーム性（ゲームとしての楽しさの意）は落ちてしまったと感じる
XCOM:EUはXCOM2よりも飽きの来る要素が多いはずなのに⋯だ！
※EUでは敵の配置が一部完全固定だったり⋯etc

繰り返し遊ぶゲームとしてみるとXCOM2の方が優秀なはずである
ではなぜ私はXCOM:EUの方がゲーム性が高いと言えるのか？
XCOM:EUのゲーム性はまるでパワプロなのだ
パワプロもメインイベントは決まった日に起こるはずなのに、何度もプレイしても楽しい

XCOM:EUではストーリーの進行と、ミッションが適切な間隔で詰まっており
兵士の計画的な育成（＝ビルドを組む楽しさ）と、時間制限（＝敵の更新／強化）
のバランスがすごい良かったのだ
そしてランダム性が少ないことが→上手くなれば、あらゆる要素を縛っても戦術で勝てる
など良い方向に働いたりした

一方でXCOM2では、多くの追加要素により楽しさも増したが、
その分ストーリーとミッションの関連性が薄れ、またタイムリミット枠の選ばれし者たちの介入は、
戦闘を長引かせる良くない要素の一つだと思う
選ばれし者自体はすごく面白いのだが、3人は多い！ゲームのかさ増しになってしまってる

ストーリーとレジスタンスの尻拭いを交互にやらされるのも間延びする原因だ
XCOM:EUでは助ける国と、見捨てる国の切り分けも緊張感を煽る良いスパイスだった
XCOM:EUでの上手くなるは「ゲームオーバーにならなければ見捨てて/切り捨ててOK」だった
XCOM2では上手くなると「滅亡カウンターがやばくなってきたから、そろそろ助けに行くか～」と、どの難易度でもなった
侵略されてXCOM:EUより悲惨なはずなのに、なんか緊張感にかけるのである
追加要素をプレイさせるために、滅亡までの時間にどうしても猶予が出来てしまったためだ
この点がゲーム性がXCOM:EUより落ちてしまったと感じる部分だ

難易度が上がると、どんどん無駄を減らすプレイングが重要で、駆け抜けるようなゲームプレイ感になるXCOM:EUと
研究や勢力や選ばれし者など、たくさんの要素からどっしり構えて戦略を練っていくXCOM2とプレイ感が違う
そしてたまたまXCOM:EUの方が私に合っていただけなのかも知れない

色々言ったがXCOM2のMODでの拡張性と、それに伴う豊富なキャラクリは本当に最高なので
みんなもお気に入りのキャラを作ってプレイしよう！

For many years, I didn't have the time to play the game, or would like to spend 90 dollars on the game title at the time. 9 years later, it's 5 bucks on discounts, and it plays just as well as when i was continuing from 2015 from XCOM 1. Highly recommend this game to be played by people. That and my potato Intel i3 cheap laptop from 2021 runs the game just as nice, even at the lowest display graphics (with a little longer loading time). | Excelente jogo de turnos e estrategia, único percalço é que após findar Advent o jogo acaba automaticamente (s/ pós-game)."

This is the first one that really forced me to think about what I'm doing and care about protecting my units. | It's Homeworld in the desert. I think they translated the gameplay to ""2D"" pretty well and they still tell a pretty good story. The graphics leave a little to be desired, but they're not bad. The vehicle designs are good, sound effects are great, music is spot-on. | A great Game, I like the Story!
However it was to short, you want more after this.
would be lovely if there where more stories comming | it's a fun game, but goddam is it buggy. there's a strike fighter bug where eventually some of your stirke fighters refuse to launch, preventing their use for the rest of the campaign, AND YOU CAN'T SALVAGE THEM, so it's just a dead aircraft slot you'll never see again. THIS HAS BEEN A BUG SINCE RELEASE. FIX IT GODDAMMIT. | The campaign was very engaging and I really enjoyed it, even though it was linear.  The skirmish play was less entertaining as the AI tends to saturate itself with resource harvesters versus combat units which means they eventually are easy targets due to unit limits.  I've not done PvP as the prevailing strategy in this type of game is simply who can zerg-rush the other the fastest.

Una perdida de tiempo total. | Of course they delisted it! That's what SEGA does. They make a compilation but only one press of it, then they make a new version for the next consoles but it's worse. Then they put the games on Steam and remove them because they're working on ANOTHER compilation, this time with an atrocious UI, and later remove that as well. Mark my words, Switch 2 is coming out for way more money than reasonable and SEGA mentioned wanting to revive some of their popular franchises, two of which have since been made better by other companies, two of which were tried previously and came out awful - they're not making AAA revisits of the greats, they're making WayForward vibe games for $40 each and will pump out another compilation.

Controlar al personaje en la rueda se siente bien. Aunque cuando hay que hacer plataformeo se siente medio tosco. A la hora de usar al personaje caminando es incluso más tosco. Pero el plataformeo es mínimo así que no le doy importancia.
Usar las armas también es muy divertido, pero el juego tiene un problema de balanceo muy grande. Esto se debe a la tercera mejora de cualquiera de los dos tipos de armas (particularmente las de misiles combinada con la escopeta). Te vuelves demasiado roto al punto de que el jefe final acaba siendo extremadamente fácil. Es por esa razón que el juego agrega muchísimos insta-kills por todos lados. Esta es la manera del juego de agregar dificultad. No sé, se siente medio feo.
Al matar a un monstruo, juegas un pequeño minijuego. Y estos son pintorescos. Son un detalle más para agregarle más carisma al juego. Sin embargo, creo que hay muy pocos. Te terminas cansando de ver los mismos minijuegos una y otra vez. A veces tienen leves variaciones en los gráficos pero nada muy wow.
Los visuales son...algo baratos. El artstyle en general se ve bien, pero las animaciones no tanto. Se nota más que nada en los minijuegos al matar a un monstruo. Algunas cosas apenas están animadas y se sienten como si agarraras una imagen en Paint y la mueves con el mouse.
Hay muy poco que hacer en el post-game. Solo hacer las misiones secundarias, revelar todo el mapa y desbloquear los sombreritos restantes con la isla. Desearía que hubiera más ya que siento que los juegos de este estilo de exploración deberían tener otra cosa. No sé, historias secundarias, monstruos secretos, new game plus, algo.

76561197999482693,310380,Unknown,0.0,,0,"Fractured Space ist ein Teambasiertes Moba Spiel welches man vom Grundprinzip her mit LoL,Dota etc. vergleichen kann.
Ich werde nur die positiven und negativen Aspekte aufzählen,wer Infos zum Gameplay haben möchte kann sich die Beschreibung sowie Youtube Videos anschauen.

Pro:
+Open Development
(Die Entwickler befassen sich sehr stark mit den Mitspielern und zeigen ihren Entwicklungsplan offen auf dieser Website https://trello.com/b/pOsdj00F/fractured-space.Dort können Spieler ebenfalls Ideen einbringen und abstimmen welches Feature als nächtes entwickelt werden soll bzw. verbessert.Desweiteren kommen regelmäßig Entwickler auf die Gameserver wo man diese direkt ansprechen kann und aauch immer ein Feedback bekommt.Zusätzlich gibt es einen TS3 Server auf dem des öfteren ein ""Community Day"" abgehalten wird und man sich mit den Entwicklern sogar unterhalten kann,gesprochen wird natürlich nur in English.

+Hübsche Grafik
(Die Unreal Engine 4 bringt in diesem Spiel eine gute Leistung.Licht/Schatten,Effekte sowie Texturen sehen Größtenteils sauber und naja spacig aus^^.)

+Große Auswahl an Schiffen
(Es gibt trotz Early Acess eine Ganze Armada an verschiedenen Schiffen welche sich meistens komplett unterschiedlich spielen und einsetzen lassen.)

+Free to play Model
(Nach der Alpha wird dieses Spiel Free to play und wenn ich dass richtig beurteilen kann dann kein Pay2Win.Man kann sich im moment nur Tarnungen bzw. Skins für seine Schiffe von echten Geld kaufen,den Rest muss man sich erspielen.
Es gibt zwar Premiumschiffe nur sind diese identisch mit ihren normalen Ebenbildern und haben keine erhöten Stats,sondern geben lediglich mehr exp/credits am ende einer Runde)

+Einfache,saubere Steuerung
(Die Steuerung des Schiffes ist ziehmlich simpel gehalten trotzdem können erfahrenere Spieler anspruchsvollere Manöver ausführen als Anfänger.Also kann man sich im Spielstil weiterentwickeln was einen imensen Vorteil in manchen Situationen bringen kann.)

+Startegie Faktor
(Durch die meist langsame Bewegung der Schiffe kann man nicht immer überall sein,so muss man sich überlegen wo man als nächstes hinspringt.Man muss sich oft überlegen ob man im Sektor A bleibt oder doch lieber zu B springt um da weiter zu kommen bzw. zu verteidigen.Es gibt noch viele weitere Faktoren die ich hier nicht aufzählen möchte trd. hat dieses Spiel eine strategische Tiefe die man nicht unbeachtet lassen darf.)

Kontra:

- Bugs,teilweise unbalanciert,Crashes
(Dieses Kontra enpfinde ich als eher nichtig,da dass Spiel sich in einer Alpha befindet und somit Fehler haben darf.
Dennoch gibt es oft Mapbugs,das Spiel crashed durch Ladefehler,am Anfang einer Runde hängt sich der Server auf wodurch man warten oder das Spiel neu starten muss,manche Schiffe können mit anderen kaum bzw. garnicht mithalten usw.
Ich gehe aber davon aus,da ich oft mit entwicklern gesprochen habe,dass diese Kindheitsfehler noch behoben werden.)

-schlechte Performance/schlechte Server
(Auf meinem PC läuft dass Spiel am Anfang einer Runde sauber mit 70-80 fps allerdings verschlechtern sich diese drastisch auf bis zu 20-30 fps wenn es zu einem großen Kampf kommt.Mein PC setup steht in meiner Profilbeschreibung,ich selbst klassifiziere es als mid-high system.Wenn die Entwickler wirklich ein Free2Play Model wollen sollten sie an diesem Punkt ordentlich schrauben,sonst werden die meisten Spieler von diesem Spiel ablassen nur wegen der Performance.
Außerdem verursacht die hohe Latenz von durchschnittlich 100 eine ziehmlich bemerkbare verzögerung in der Steuerung.)


Ich persönlich vertraue auf die Entwickler da diese schon oft gezeigt haben dass sie können und wollen.
Die nahe Zusammenarbeit mit der Community und die Regelmäßigen Updates machen dieses Spiel immer besser und immer mehr Gamer tummeln sich auf den Servern.
Das größte Kontra ist die relativ schelchte Performance und der stetig hohe Ping,was das Gameplay teilweise komplett zerstört.Es wär schade wenn so ein Spiel gemieden wird,nur weil es schlechte Server und eine madige Perfomance besitzt.

Meinerseits eine Kaufempfehlung an Spieler die Sci-Fi mögen und an Competetive Moba Gamer.

Ps. über Feedback zum Review freue ich mich immer :)

 | Интересная неторопливая поначалу игра в космические кораблики плавно перетекла в активный тактический шутер с прокачкой корабля. Кораблей не очень много и на сегодня они напоминают TF2 персонажей: тяжелый и неторопливый танкующий крепыш, снайпер, шпион-подсиратель, середнячок для масс и т.д... Ну разве что для авианосца нет особого аналога. И шляп нет. Зато можно менять орудия, причем принцип действия каждого может отличаться кардинально (Например, ракеты или торпеды летят с разной скоростью и скорость наведения тоже разная, у каких-то торпед вообще наведение почти нулевое).
_
Для альфы очень неплохой задел, т.к. способности кораблей далеко не всегда помогают и решает правильное позиционирование себя на поле боя, и в соло бой вряд ли вытащишь, как бы хорошо ты не управлял кораблем, как бы не использовал астероиды для укрытия, как бы не уходил в инвиз или использовал преимущество в скорости. Игра нетороплива, но в итоге четкий просчет скоростей и состава кораблей противника позволяют творить невероятные гамбиты и вождения за нос. 
_
Для альфы стандартный набор минусов: на 28 января малый онлайн (в основном пользователи Нового Света), Ошибки матчмейкинга и частые зависания при входе в матч, в моем случае пришлось дополнительно настроить ярлык на запуск с дискретной видеокартой, как и со всеми альфами, бетами и иногда даже готовыми релизами.

П.С. Звуки и окружающий звук неплохо погружают в атмосферу. Пиу-пиу! Дакка-дакка! Ка-бууум! Пдыщь! Бам! | このゲームは、数千人が乗り込む巨大戦艦を操り5VS5で相手陣営の本拠点占領を目標に戦うものです。将来的にFreeToPlayになりますが、現時点で購入しておいて損にはなりません。何故ならば出資者ボーナスが付与されるだけでなく、宇宙が好き、SFが好きという方にとって満足いくものだからです。

　ゲーム内には様々な艦船がすでに実装されており、ステルス航行が可能なものや、そのステルス航行している艦船をブイを設置し探知するもの、短距離ワープを繰り返しながら戦うもの、高いHPをもった対空砲（範囲攻撃）を連射して戦うもの、長距離狙撃と味方の火力アップを担うもの、味方のHP回復や相手の武器やスキルを一時的に無効化するものなどがあります。

　それぞれの船ごとに得意な戦い方があり、苦手な相手がいます。従って○○を選べば最強というものではありません。しかしながら事前にチームを組んで戦うものではないため、その場で出会った人とチームを組んで戦う事が多く、結果的に誰もが対処できない艦船が相手に居るため負けることもあります。

　最後に。SF好きな人にとって、初期に乗れる艦船ですら、「あ、ここに飛行甲板がある！」「これは砲台だな？」と見ているだけでも結構うれしいのでは？

Fractured space is a 5 vs. 5 team battle on areas of space that has been divided in various sectors. All sectors have control points you need to capture in order to advance and eventually make your way to enemy base. During combat you can freely fly in the battlefield, warp into sectors where the combat is currently going on and warp back to base to regroup or to run away with your nearly destroyed ship for repairs. 

There's currently 15 different ship types in game, 3 of them unlocked right at the start. Ship types fit for many roles: long range, hard hitting sniper boat, heavily armored flagship for more close range combat, sneaky & stealthy assassin ship, fast moving frigate etc. As the game is currently in it's early stages, it understandably might have some balance issues between various ship designs - though I personally feel like every ship has their own use and an organized group will easily take down those solo snipers or assassins who think they can/should be able to kill everything themselves. 

PROs: 
Awesome ship design 
Well made level 
Graphics, sfx 

CONs 
1(one) level 
Very low playerbase (seen max of 54) 
Level Matching system(isn't one) 
No real training/tutorials 

For an EARLY ACCESS game, its good, Its not super great, but its really entertaining. Graphics are great, has a solid gameplay. People here are giving it negative reviews because they want a finished product but its no where near that stage yet. The game is great at its current stage and it can only get better from here. I'd definitely recommend this game for anyone who loves space sci-fi. | This game is a lot of fun. It's easy to play but there are a lot of intricacies for certain parts that if you learn will really help you. There isn't any sort of ""pay to win"" aspect of this game. All of the crew packs can be obtained through premium currency (Platinum) or standard currency that you earn in game (Credits). Other purchases are merely cosmetic, they are reskins of the ships. Different paint jobs and the like. Ships can be purchased with Platinum or Credits. 
The game is fair, and a lot of fun. The AI is actually really good in my opinion and at times can be rather challenging. 
I highly recommend this game, and I hope the developers keep working on it, adding more ships and *maps* and different crews."

I don't know what exactly the minimum amount of time is, but I'm confident I've surpassed it, whatever it is.  

I've been with the game since launch, and it has managed to get better basically every year.  The game has always been pretty fun, though a little quirky early on.  The developers have improved it a lot and it is very enjoyable now, if perhaps a little complicated if you've never played a game like this before.  

So, yes, I recommend Stellaris. | [h1]Stellaris[/h1]
[u][i]«Stellaris — это редкий случай, когда игра не стареет, а эволюционирует. Как и сама вселенная, которую она изображает».[/i][/u]

[quote][i]Всем привет. Автор не несет ответственности за причиненный вред своими обзорами. Любое сходство с другими обзорами случайно. Данный обзор является лишь мнением автора и вы можете всегда оставаться при своем мнении! Спасибо за понимание и приятной игры![/i][/quote]

[h1]Описание:[/h1]
[i][b]Stellaris[/b] — это смесь грандиозной 4X-стратегии, ролевой игры и интерактивного романа, где вы сами пишете историю своего народа среди звёзд. Разработчики создали  эпическое повествование о взлётах и падениях цивилизации. От первых робких шагов в космосе до управления межгалактической империей — здесь есть место всему: дипломатии, войнам, предательствам и открытиям, которые перевернут ваше представление о жанре.[/i]

[b]Основа игры: Механики, которые затягивают на сотни часов[/b]
[i][list]
[*] [b]Создание своей цивилизации:[/b] Stellaris начинается с того, что вы буквально конструируете расу из десятков параметров: этика (милитаристы, пацифисты, ксенофобы), тип общества (биологическое, роботы, псионики), черты (адаптивность, интеллект, агрессия) и даже внешность. Хотите играть за миролюбивых космических слизней, строящих галактическую федерацию? Или за машинную империю, стремящуюся ассимилировать все органические расы? Здесь возможно всё.

[*] [b]Исследование и открытия:[/b] Галактика в Stellaris генерируется случайно, и каждое новое игра — это путешествие в неизвестность. Вы будете:
- Исследовать аномалии (например, древние руины или гравитационные аномалии).
- Встречать кризисы (вторжение внегалактических захватчиков, восстание синтетиков).
- Заключать союзы или уничтожать соседей.

[*] [b]Дипломатия и войны:[/b] 
- Дипломатия: От торговых соглашений до создания федераций — здесь можно решать судьбы галактики без единого выстрела.
- Войны: Система военных целей позволяет вести не тотальные войны, а конфликты с чёткими задачами (захват системы, освобождение вассала).
- Шпионаж и провокации: Саботаж, кража технологий, поддержка повстанцев — идеально для любителей «тихих» конфликтов.

[*] [b]Экономика и управление:[/b] 
- Балансировка ресурсов (энергия, минералы, пища, потребительские товары) — основа процветания.
- Планирование заселения планет, строительство мегасооружений (кольцевые миры, сферы Дайсона) и управление населением с уникальными потребностями.
[/list][/i]

[i][b]Сильные стороны: Почему Stellaris покоряет сердца[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]Нарративная глубина:[/b] События в игре — это не просто текст, а истории с последствиями. Например, обнаружение «Храмового комплекса» может привести к пробуждению древнего бога-червя, который переформатирует вашу расу, или к гибели всего живого в секторе.

[*] [b]Реиграбельность:[/b] Благодаря случайной генерации галактики, сотням событий и возможности создавать уникальные цивилизации, каждая партия кардинально отличается от предыдущей.

[*] [b]Моддерская поддержка:[/b] Stellaris обладает одной из самых активных моддерских сообществ. Моды добавляют новые расы, сюжеты, механики и даже полностью меняют сеттинг.

[*] [b]Постоянное развитие:[/b] Paradox регулярно обновляет игру, исправляя ошибки и добавляя новые фичи. Даже спустя 7 лет после релиза Stellaris остаётся актуальной.
[/list][/i]

[h1]Плюсы:[/h1]
[i][list]
[*] [b]Беспрецедентная свобода творчества:[/b] Создавайте уникальные расы с собственной этикой, чертами и историей. Хотите играть за пацифистов-грибов или машин-уничтожителей? Всё возможно. Проработанная система происхождений (например, «Потерянная колония» или «Синтетическая эволюция») задаёт тон всей партии.

[*] [b]Нарративная глубина:[/b] Сотни случайных событий, археологических цепочек и кризисов превращают игру в космическую сагу. Истории в духе научной фантастики: от восстания ИИ до встречи с божественными червями.

[*] [b]Реиграбельность:[/b] Случайная генерация галактики, разные типы кризисов (вторжение Пожирателей, Восстание машин) и бесконечные комбинации рас обеспечивают уникальность каждой партии.

[*] [b]Дипломатия и взаимодействие:[/b] От создания федераций до подрывных операций — здесь есть инструменты для любой стратегии. Возможность играть без войн, побеждая через культурное доминирование или политические интриги.

[*] [b]Моддерская поддержка:[/b] Огромная библиотека модов: от новых рас и кораблей до полных переработок вселенной (например, «Star Trek» или «Warhammer 40K»).

[*] [b]Атмосферность:[/b] Эпичный саундтрек, стилистика кораблей и планет, голосовые оповещения — всё это погружает в атмосферу живой галактики.

[*] [b]Постоянное развитие:[/b] Paradox регулярно обновляет игру, добавляя новые механики и исправляя ошибки.

[*] [b]Достижения:[/b] Присутствие получения различных достижений, что добавляет элемент соревновательности и мотивации с другими игроками которые смогли получить сложные достижения с особыми условиями.

[*] [b]Коллекционные предметы:[/b] Присутствуют обои, смайлики, карточки из которых можно скрафтить значки
[/list][/i]

[h1]Минусы:[/h1]
[i][list]
[*] [b]Высокий порог вхождения:[/b] Десятки ресурсов, технологий и механик могут перегрузить новичков. Обучение в игре поверхностное.

[*] [b]Проблемы с оптимизацией:[/b] На поздних стадиях игра начинает лагать, особенно в больших галактиках. Мультиплеер часто страдает от десинхронизации.

[*] [b]Дисбаланс механик:[/b] Некоторые стратегии (например, спам роботами или «танкирование» инфляции) остаются неоправданно сильными. ИИ часто действует нелогично: мирные империи внезапно объявляют войны, а ксенофобы предлагают союзы.

[*] [b]Повторяемость:[/b] После 100+ часов цепочки событий и диалоги начинают повторяться. Кризисы следуют одним и тем же сценариям.

[*] [b]Зависимость от DLC:[/b] Без дополнений (например, Utopia или Apocalypse) игра ощущается неполной. Многие «крутые» фичи (кольцевые миры, титаны) locked за платными DLC.

[*] [b]Ограниченная роль личности:[/b] Лидеры и фракции слабо влияют на игру. Их смерть или смена редко меняют курс империи.
[/list][/i]

[h1]Заключение:[/h1]
[i]Stellaris — это не просто игра. Это симулятор бесконечности, где каждая звезда может стать домом для новой цивилизации, а каждый чёрный ящик — хранить секреты, способные изменить галактику. Да, здесь есть проблемы с балансом и оптимизацией, но когда ваш флот из тысяч кораблей вступает в бой с внегалактическими захватчиками под эпичную музыку, вы понимаете: это не просто код и спрайты. Это — настоящее космическое приключение.[/i]

Всем добра, удачи и приятной игры! ^_^[/i] | Essentially a spreadsheet simulator in which you're just trying to make sure that you have the biggest or best numbers around. If you're meticulous and enjoy micromanaging, this is a great game to play. The mods for this game are also amazing! I highly recommend checking out the steam workshop for this game if you ever feel like vanilla starts to get kinda stale. And while this is my most played game, I DO NOT RECOMMEND GETTING THIS GAME FULL PRICE. Frequently this game goes on sale for like 75% and the base game alone is not worth the price tag especially as a lot of features that most Stellaris players like messing with are behind DLCs so unless there's some part of the game that you're desperate to play with I'd get the base game and any interesting DLC while they're on sale. | 肥肠好的游戏，使我的巨像旋转，之前玩的盗版，现在终于史低补票（仅本体）了，但P社的DLC是真贵，只能用学习版，等有钱了慢慢补票吧。 | So this is exactly the type of multiple month game time negative review that gets screen shot and memed on social media, but I'm sad to say I mean it in the most literal sense.  I have enjoyed much of my play time with Stellaris, but I emphatically don't recommend anyone purchase this game in it's current, maximum DLC form.
When this game launched, it was a refreshingly basic 4X. Most of the changes made in the early years all the way to the Nemesis expansion added meaningfully to the gameplay without making it overwhelming and complicated for new players.  Unfortunately recent patches and expansions have unfortunately been hats on hats, mostly adding complexity without adding fun.  I have enjoyed the ride for the most part, but like most Paradox games the continual addition of DLC eventually replaces the game you loved with something you barely recognize while draining your wallet."

76561197999482693,464060,RUINER,0.2,"Action, Indie",0,"RUINER is a stylish and brutally fast-paced cyberpunk action game that excels in atmosphere and combat but falls short in storytelling and variety. It’s a game that delivers intense, adrenaline-fueled action wrapped in a visually striking world, but it sometimes struggles to maintain depth beyond its aesthetic.

The biggest strength of RUINER is its presentation. The neon-drenched cyberpunk cityscapes, glitchy UI effects, and pounding synthwave soundtrack create an incredible sense of style and immersion. Every frame of the game feels like a cyberpunk fever dream, with sharp, angular designs and a haunting, dystopian atmosphere that pulls you in immediately.

The combat is another highlight. It’s fast, brutal, and satisfying, rewarding quick reflexes and tactical thinking. The mix of melee and ranged weapons, along with abilities like dashes and shields, keeps encounters exciting and fluid. The game makes you feel powerful, but never invincible, as enemies hit hard and require careful positioning and strategy to defeat. Boss fights, in particular, are intense and well-designed, pushing you to master the game’s mechanics.

However, RUINER has its drawbacks. The story is minimalistic and doesn’t feel as engaging as the world it’s set in. While the themes of corporate oppression and cybernetic augmentation are intriguing, the narrative doesn’t develop enough to make you truly invested in your silent protagonist’s journey. The game also leans heavily on its cyberpunk aesthetic without offering much depth in world-building.

Another issue is the repetition. While combat is fun, the enemy encounters start to blend together after a while, and mission objectives don’t offer much variety beyond “kill everything in the room.” The game’s length is fairly short, which helps prevent fatigue, but it still could have used more diversity in gameplay.

Overall, RUINER is a visually stunning and mechanically satisfying game that thrives on its cyberpunk atmosphere and intense action but falls short in narrative depth and variety. If you’re looking for a fast-paced, stylish action game with an amazing soundtrack, it’s worth playing—but don’t expect it to redefine the genre.

Rating: 7/10 – A sleek, cyberpunk power trip with repetitive gameplay and a forgettable story. | I love it. The gameplay, characters, and just general aesthetics. Character designs are also so damn good. Trafficking/KING was funny as hell lmao, guy never got a break. Story-wise, it's good but honestly I thought there were gonna be more relationship dialogue with HER. My gf turned out to be AI sent to clean out HEAVEN :c

Reikon the GOAT. 
I genuinely need HER in my life. I need HER. PLEASE GOD GIVE ME HER. | That is one of the perfect examples of both cyberpunk games and a fast-paced top down shooter

10 KILL BOSS / 10 | I'd consider this a must-play for fans of top-down shooters. The vibes, music, and gameplay are flawless. The story leaves a bit to be desired for how much amazing worldbuilding there is, but that's really my only complaint.

I bought this game because it has johnn cruelty in it, but honestly the gameplay is pretty good. Def buy on sale | Brigador is a really awesome game and a must have for any mech fans out there. 

This game is absolutely packed with content, there are many different mechs for you to pilot (and many different characters to choose from) and the customization for the mechs is quite extensive. The story is fairly interesting and there is a goodly amount of campaign levels, other levels that can be unlocked, and several game modes.

It's definitely a ton of fun stomping around and destroying buildings, killing enemies, etc. If you want to pilot a mech and just be an unstoppable killing machine, this is it. The level of destruction that you can create is incredible and something that will keep you coming back for more if you really like to create and see a lot of in game blood & destruction. 

Brigador is something special and I'm really looking forward to the sequel. However, be warned that it can be difficult at times and the controls can be kind of janky and take some getting used to. 

Besides that, I highly recommend this game, and I encourage anyone who considers themselves to be true mech fans to pick this little treasure up on sale and give it a spin. 

Plays pretty well & looks great on Steam Deck. 
 | Brigador is not really a top down shooter in the old school bullet hell sense. Its really more like a streamlined vehicle combat game which just so happens to take place from the top down perspective. It is very easy to learn but difficult to master. Furthermore I would recommend playing Tanks and Mechs with the ""Relative"" (old school tank controls) control scheme and the Agrav with the (Screen absolute) control scheme. 

Basically one of the best western mecha things ever to have been made. | One sunny afternoon, after buying Brigador, I've put 'Eternal Flame' by Bangles on repeat and played this game for 4-5 hours straight until completion. It was truly a wonderful way to spend my day. 

Unfortunately my aunt was a bit troubled by my autism and politely asked me if ""that would be enough of Eternal Flame playing non stop?"".

Типичный хоррор - штуер с элементами выживания, так как иногда будет нехватка всего.
По сюжету тоже вышло неплохо. | Pros

+ Atmospheric World-Building: Talos I is beautifully crafted, with each room and corridor radiating a sense of history and foreboding. The environment feels alive, and the attention to detail makes every discovery rewarding

+ Non-Linear Gameplay: One of the game’s standout features is its emphasis on player choice. Whether you prefer direct confrontation or sneaking past threats, Prey allows you to adapt your play style to the situation

+ Variety in Gameplay Mechanics: From combat and stealth to puzzle-solving and resource management, Prey offers a mix of gameplay elements that keep the experience fresh throughout

+ Immersive Sim Elements: The ability to interact with the environment in multiple ways—using tools, crafting upgrades, or finding alternative paths—adds depth to the gameplay and encourages creative problem-solving

Cons

- Pacing Issues: Despite its engaging setup, some parts of the game can feel unnecessarily slow

- Repetitive Encounters: While the Typhon enemies are designed to be both terrifying and challenging, some encounters can feel repetitive, potentially reducing the tension over time

- Balance Concerns: At times, certain weapons or abilities may feel overpowered, whereas others seem less useful. This occasional imbalance can affect the overall

- Enemy Difficulty: In some instances, the enemy AI proves to be unforgiving

Prey is a commendable attempt at blending atmospheric storytelling with gameplay flexibility. Its richly detailed setting and intriguing narrative make it a worthwhile experience, especially for those who appreciate games that reward creative problem-solving and exploration. However, the occasional pacing issues, repetitive encounters, balancing problems, and the sometimes overwhelming enemy difficulty prevent it from achieving perfection.

All things considered, I’d give Prey a 7 out of 10. If you’re a fan of immersive sci-fi adventures that let you choose your own path, Prey is definitely worth checking out—even if it isn’t without its flaws. | Ну что... собирался пройти ее 200 лет. И зря.

За 150р по скидке - отличная игра и даже могу рекомендовать.

Подобно наркоману, гоняющимся за выработкой мозгом гормонов. Безусловно это внесёт несоизмеримый вклад в развитие научных направлений и самого человеческого вида. Поэтому да — это игра стоит того,  проебать своё время и выбросить на помойку свою жизнь, став пылью на дороге истории, по которой пройдут более достойные потомки человечества нежели ты.

I like both, Warhammer and 4x games. However, the depth isnt there anywhere near the level I expect from a 4X game, while on the other hand, the action isnt as high paced, as I would want it from a Warhammer game.

Aside from that, its not terrible. Just not good either. Which sadly already puts it in the top 10% of Warhammer games I guess."

Requires lots of patience and quicksaving, but I think it forces you to be a lot more creative. The stages have brilliant level design that opens them up for exploration and provides many different ways to work your way through. I really loved the verticality they've built into the level design and every level is distinct from every other. Crack in the Slab and Clockwork Mansion are two particularly clever levels that make their gimmicks feel super unique. 

It's not perfect, though the issues that I did have were relatively minor. Possibly the worst problem is that the controls can be a little finnicky - by far the worst of these is the stealth knockout command. I would somewhat routinely walk up behind an enemy, hit the button for stealth knockout, and then do nothing for a moment until bumping into them and getting caught. It seems to be really bad at detecting that you're close enough to knock them out unless you're on perfectly even terrain with your target (you will very routinely take out enemies on stairs or slopes). It's also just impossible to knock out an enemy if they have their back to a wall or are in a chair, which means that you have to lure them out in a way that feels strange. If I'm 6 inches from the target and they can't see me, I should be able to knock them out. Drop down aerial knockouts are also somewhat annoying, though this isn't quite as bad. 

Another minor issue is that characters can die very easily once you knock them out, which for my purposes was a no-go. And I don't just mean that they can be killed by real threats, though that is of course a possibility - I lost a lot of progress once because I ""killed"" a couple guards by throwing them into a corner with some wood panels. The panels shattered and somehow killed the guards, even though there's really no indication that this was dangerous beyond maybe a few splinters. There were also a few other instances I had of annoying quest or NPC behavior where they didn't quite cooperate with me.

I wish Emily's powers were slightly more useful. Aside from the movement-oriented Far Reach, I felt like Domino was by far my most used power and the rest were somewhat less useful, though I do think it's really clever how they designed Domino to work for either a lethal or non-lethal playthrough. Shadow walk I found to be lackluster, and the others I didn't use much because I bought them pretty late in the game.

Anyway, great game. I might have to play through as Corvo someday, though I think I've had enough for now. Definite recommend if you liked the first game. | An absolute delight.
Great graphics, audio, mechanics & story.
If you intend to play stealthy, then choose Emily when presented with the option.
This a solid 9/10 game, and totally worth it.
 | В першій частині ліпше виконані сюжет,  система хаоса та її вплав на оточення, що у діалогах , що у зміні облаштування локацій.

76561197999482693,363680,Battlefleet Gothic: Armada,4.35,Strategy,1,"game really does not requires a lot of thinking. You need to be like Maru. If your finger rpm is great, well, you will win, if not.

That is not strategic thinking. It is micro managment


I do not recommend this game | I really gelled with this one more so than the sequel, follows the old Battlefleet Gothic rule book in most parts other than being real time. The upgrades and story that maps across from the rule book was very enjoyable along with the sounds and it being very true to 40k forth and fifth addition in tone and look. Smaller scale than Armada 2 does give it some favours as less micro heavy. 

 | Эту игру сложно рекомендовать тем, кто далек от сеттинга Warhammer 40000, постольку поскольку они просто не поймут, почему в ней все происходит именно так и разведут нытье про про плоское поле боя, начнут сравнивать с каким-нибудь Homeworld и прочие нелепицы.
""BG:A"" - это тактическая стратегия в реальном времени, позволяющая игроку взять под контроль небольшой флот Империума/Эльдар/Орков/Хаоса и стойко выдерживать (в кампании, доступной, к несчастью, только за Имперский Флот) нескончаемые волны хаотических сил под командованием Абаддона Разорителя. И всё бы ничего, но сделана игра по настольному оригиналу, и оттого держится в довольно тесных его рамках: размер флотов нельзя назвать большим - обычно счёт идёт на два-три крупных корабля, или пяток мелких - что, с одной стороны, облегчает контроль над сражениями, но с другой придаёт игре чрезмерную камерность: тому, что в бою решается судьба целого сектора - не всегда веришь, особенно когда рекламные ролики демонстрируют схватку сотен могучих крейсеров.
Атмосфера! Главный плюс, за один который уже стоит купить эту игру. Наверное, единственная игра по вархаммеру, в которой ВООБЩЕ не заcран бэк. Серьёзно. Да, сюжет просто пересказывает основные события Готической войны, но к большему и не нужно стремиться, когда есть такая обширная база, как мир WH40k. Никаких отступлений от бэка я не заметил. Всё, что делает вархаммер вархаммером: фанатизм имперского культа, расстрелы трусов, битвы огромных армий, жертвоприношения целых планет, экстерминатусы, ужасы варпа, работа навигаторов и астропатов - всё это органично вписано в геймплей. Разве что бомбы и прочие способности на площадь не особо вписываются, но это мелочи.
 Отдельно стоит выделить катсцены. В целом, это простенько анимированные арты, и их не так уж много. Но как же они красивы! Они отлично озвучены, отлично нарисованы, отлично срежессированы. Уж лучше красивое 2d, чем плохое 3d. В конце концов, разве не за арты мы любим вархаммер?

Видно, что игру делали не спустя рукава - она красивая, интуитивно понятная и удобная - но, к сожалению, её можно считать скорее нишевым продуктом, нацеленным на любителей адреналиновых стычек с другими людьми, нежели крупной игрой по шикарной франшизе. И тем не менее - это ХОРОШАЯ игра. Хоть и очень своеобразная.
 | 除了根本没有良好的翻译这一点以外，如果你会英语，那么这个游戏根本不成问题，良好的一塌糊涂。至于关卡设计，我也SL了很多次，只能说大家吐槽的这堆任务机制，甚至在Heroic难度也确实有办法和对应战术（行星突击的防守方把所有目标区域都刷在敌人脸上除外，那个太离谱了）。数据恢复任务，有资料的敌舰会尽力避战，用这一点把他赶到人少的地方，没事不要交跳帮技能，他正在跳跃的时候赶紧冲过去抢回来，带有资料的船只被击沉之后资料会留在原地，下一个接近的船只会自动捞起来（和2代不同），除了抢资料，你也可以考虑一轮鱼雷直接击沉。刺杀同理，所有船RUSH上去把对方旗舰围殴就行。行星突击任务就是把手上每条船都给一个防守区，根据需要调动。这代每条船的自由度都很大，微型亚空间跳跃配合改进鸟卜仪阵列是神技，但航母不好用。技能玩不过来可以适度右键交给系统自动使用，总的来说其实比二代好玩。 | Steep learning curve and UI is not super intuitive, but the campaign has been fun so far and rewarding to see myself improve.

It's not GTA, or Saints Row, but the Mafia series Is always a good amount of fun set In an Interesting era, following Interesting characters In a beautiful open world environment. | Again still very buggy, while the immersion at first looks nice, on the second the streets are empty, AI is well the I stands for idiot, graphic is not as shiny on a second glance, there are weird glitches and effects with some surfaces. Also sometimes the game gets a stutter and then runs smoothly again or it hangs itself up. 
Lots of bugs you might encounter have never been adressed but are known from the start as one can see in the discussions all over the net. Guess it was just a short cash cow for the devs and not much more. Still the story is nice and it can be fun but be warned beforehand, buy it with the highest discount you find. | 不玩前两部我就当这部是个劣质罐头，玩了前两部再玩这个真是越来越厌恶，好在是让维托在3里当了个重要npc，让我时不时看见他想起我玩的原来是黑手党啊，还以为是育碧的幽灵行动荒野呢。

三代开场做得挺不错的，地图设计和剧情氛围都渲染得很好，到大地图就开始现原形了，整体来讲就是个分地盘的游戏，大地图有很多个区域，每个区域有各自的头目和资产，需要做各种重复的任务来把资产降为0，任务基本都是拷问npc，杀某个特定目标或者清某个据点，最后把资产降0后引出小头目，杀小头目引出大头目，占领区域，分给三个npc，npc会给你一些帮助，下个区域再重复这样的模式。三个npc还有自己的个人任务，这个是最难绷的，全是一模一样的任务，有个npc需要给他开三辆车，就去目标点把车给他开来，下一个任务又是开三辆车，也就是说有五个任务要踏马开15辆车过来，不会设计任务可以不设计，真的。

整体任务的重复度就算是在我玩过的罐头游戏里也是非常重复的了，甚至一个地图都是复用，玩得我是看剧情的欲望都没有了，罐头仙人都快陨落了，玩第一部的时候还觉得地图太空，到了第三部开始折磨我了是吧😅

这游戏已经开游戏黑屏闪退好几次提醒我远离了，但是我还是找到了解决办法继续玩，需要把启动器开回来用窗口模式启动再全屏才行，这真不怪游戏了，是我喜欢赤史。"
76561197999482693,528230,SYNTHETIK: Legion Rising,15.2,"Action, Indie",5,"Great game. Wished the devs continued working on adding more content rather than make a mediocre sequel. | An amazing twin-stick shooter roguelike. This game doesn't screw around, specially at military bay. Also it is a spicy roguelike, with many curses, modules, upgrades that can make or break your run, i really appreciate games that let me break the power limit of the game like this one.

The main problem of this game is its engine, its [b] GameMaker Engine[/b] and it shows, as this is the most complex game made on GameMaker ever. Some issues are kind of unfixable like stutters during the jet plane fight, and it does push the engine to its limit.

Still, is better than synthetik 2 as of writting of this review, as that game is kind of in a sort of development hell atm.

So get this instead, you wont regret it, and you can play with a pal.
I give this game a 9/10 | In the words of a great man, ""Hey Hey People""

For real though this game is great, I've not unlocked everything yet but it is great for something to do if you have a half hour and don't want to really get into anything super deep. The game play is almost rhythmic and each run is pretty fun! | Fun game a lot of action for a 2d shooter
Good amount of meta progression to keep you coming back 
 | TLDR; Armageddon go BRRRRR 10/10 worth every penny

I have so much good to say about this game I would not be able to fit it all here.

It just feels really great to play, a run of Synthetik can go from a desperate struggle against staggering odds to a complete power trip in the span of seconds. Rewarding good gameplay and adaptability with excellent RNG, really makes this a fun and very replayable rougelite. The most intense moments of this game will give you a feeling not too many games will give you.

ALL of the weapons feel great and always have a use, regardless of class, if you are willing to roll with the punches, you can make it work. Even if that weapons crate gives you a sniper on your shotgun run, there is typically a way to make it work, you just need to adapt, the RNG never feels out of place, you simply need to get creative. Strapping an ammo printer to a large-magazine machine-gun creates one of the best power trips in a shooter I have ever had.

The art and visual direction is honestly near the top (maybe even at the top) of my list for video games. It may be more simple than its sequel but I think it has a very distinct look to it that you can't really mix up with anything else. The colour palette for the whole experience is fantastic and really suits it well. You can tell a lot of love went into it.

The audio is an experience in-and-of itself, the soundtrack is excellent, well-suited and transitions very well in-between firefights. Gunshots have audible impact and criticals/headshots will set off dopamine receptors. I could go very in depth about how much I love the audio for this game however I am not going to write a small dissertation here. It's very good.

For such a simple concept of a dungeon crawling roguelite, this may be one of the best executions of it, fine tuned to the most minute detail. I simply can't find a single fault in this game, I have never seen a single bug while playing, from top-to-bottom this is a masterwork.

While the developers have moved on to the sequel, and this game will probably not be updated again, it doesn't need it. This feels like a labour of love that has been finished, and it is practically perfect in my opinion. An incredibly replayable game that pushes creative gameplay onto the player in a positive way.

Yes this was a love-letter. No, I don't care.

Pros:
- Literally everything

Cons:
- Literally nothing

Overall: 10/10

 | Играешь в Skyrim, думаешь, сейчас быстренько выполню квест, а потом вдруг оказываешься на другом конце карты, спасая какого-то дракона от крыс. В итоге забыл, зачем вообще пришёл в эту деревню. Местные жители, кажется, тоже в шоке — они ждут, что ты спасёшь мир, а ты пытаешься вспомнить, где оставил своего коня. И да, стрелы в коленях, кажется, стали новой модой. Если вам нравятся приключения, где можно забыть обо всём на свете и просто наслаждаться хаосом, то Skyrim — ваш идеальный выбор! | Играю в это творение с самого его выпуска на просторах интернета. Некогда меня посадил в нее брат, и это была лучшая рекомендация по играм, которую он мог мне когда-либо дать. Цифру, которую видят пользователи рядом с моей иконкой, это может, дай Бог, 1/10 часть всех проведенных часов за этой игрой. Да, когда выпускалась игра, мне было 9 лет, и я играла по своему незнанию и неумению с чит-кодами, тем не менее, освоившись с годами, поняла, что куда интереснее, когда имеешь риск, чем читы, которые ограничивали и делали тебя непобедимым. Да, всех фишек игры вдоль и поперек мне узнать по сей день не удалось, и я к этому не стремлюсь. 
Эта игра стоит того, чтобы вы ей уделили внимание, как минимум потому, что это огромный открытый мир с неимоверно широким выбором заданий. И, лично я, до сих пор не видела в гейминге игр, которые бы хоть чуть-чуть сравнивались с ней. Не спорю, опережая негативные возгласы, есть уйма других не менее проработанных хороших игр, но, по моему мнению, это не то. Skyrim тот самый прорывной проект 2011-го год, который до сих пор держит геймеров у экранов, так и вовлекая из года в год перепройти его заново.
Запуская игру, ты идешь туда уже далеко не ради графики, ибо, конечно, стоит признать, что для 2025-го года это уже не аргумент. Ты идешь ради неповторимого сюжета, который всего через пару игровых сессий так и просит подпевать бардам в таверне ""Герой он бесстрашный, он непобедим..."". Ведь герой, Довакин - это ты, человек неопределенной расы, который неведомым образом попадается на пересечении границы и оказывается тем, кто спасет весь мир. Причем игра дает возможность спасти Скайрим абсолютно разными способами: как будучи воином в драконьих доспехах с секирой Вутрад наперерез, так и крысой из Гильдии, тыркающей противников на х10 урона бритвой Мерунеса. Продвигаясь по разным сюжетным линиям, ты обретаешь многих верных сторонников (даже включая продажных наемников в тавернах, которые в последующем могут и отдаться Боэтии ради тебя). Некоторых из них имеется возможность брать в напарники, в зависимости от направленности твоего персонажа: нужен ли тебе лучник или  шут с кинжалом. Надоело рубить драконов, сражая их своим воинственным голосом? Пойдем, отыщем лук Ауриэля и будем жечь вампиров. Не хочешь? Пошли выпьем с незнакомцем в баре по кружке эля и узнаем, что тот даэдра гулянок. Хочешь тихой семейной жизни? Купи участок, построй особняк своей мечты и устройся там, может быть даже с мужем/женой и детьми. 
Устав от всех этих историй и геройств, ты можешь просто взобраться на холм под вечер с чистым небом и наблюдать за звездами. Звездные каскады - это не менее прекрасная причина прогуляться по просторам Скайрима и его окрестностям.
А для любителей мультиплеера создатели придумали онлайн версию, с которой вы можете также ознакомиться.
Но есть и свои ""-"" у сие произведения. Наиболее сущей проблемой стали для меня баги, когда я впервые зашла в официальную версию игры. Особенно по отношению к  компаньонам: передвижение в виде чистой модельки, исчезновение их частей тела, застревание в приседе, отставания от главного героя на половину карты и даже невозможность их выхода из локаций. В таких ситуациях спасают некоторые коды и частые сохранения, однако оставляет неприятный осадок. Тем не менее, это даже иногда забавляет и добавляет юмора в серые будни средневекового главного героя.
Даже спустя 13 лет после релиза, мне не надоели эти образы, байки, сюжетные повороты. Это как хорошее вино, с каждым годом только вкуснее. Смакуйте, друзья, а потом идите в не менее прекрасные проекты, как этот! | Sem sombra de dúvidas esse é o melhor RPG que já joguei, até dá pra jogar sem mods, mas não recomendo.

Al principio, como nuestros ancestros sumerios balbucearon palabras en su lenguaje primigenio, yo también me encontré balbuceando entre decisiones que parecían dictadas por voces sin rostro. Dónde quedaba el libre albedrío del que tanto alardeamos. Al principio, odié este acometido impuesto por los escritores de mi destino en estos lares, pero poco a poco, entendí que mi periplo no era solo una línea invisible que seguir. Había un propósito más profundo, una razón que no podía ignorar.
Avanzar en esta tierra inhóspita no fue sencillo. Mi mazo dejó su huella en las carnes de muchos enemigos, y cada golpe arrancó no solo trozos de sus vidas, sino también fragmentos de mi tiempo. Vi los horrores de la guerra en Whiterun, sentí la frialdad de los glaciares en Hibernalia, y escuche los susurros de conspiraciones en la Hermandad Oscura. Cada paso que daba, cada batalla que libraba, me llevaba más cerca de una verdad que intentaba ignorar: las familias que formamos son lo que verdaderamente importa.
Recorrí los pasillos del Colegio de Bardos y canté canciones que no entendía. Me adentré en las cavernas del aquelarre de Namira, donde las sombras guardan secretos que ninguna luz puede revelar. Combatí junto a los Compañeros, los Ruiseñores y los Orcos tribales, cada una de estas familias con sus propios conflictos y códigos. Pero, por mucho que intentaran abrazarme como uno de los suyos, siempre sentía que algo faltaba. No eran mi verdadera familia.
Y entonces la vi. Con su canastita llena de flores marchitas y su sonrisa frágil, caminaba por los campos de batalla sin clamar por gloria ni riquezas. Todo lo que quería era un hogar, alguien a quien llamar “papá” o “mamá”. No buscaba los placeres mundanos que otros persiguen. En ella encontré algo que había olvidado en mi corazón endurecido por las guerras: la inocencia y el anhelo de pertenecer.
Decidí que la adoptaría y le daría lo que yo no tuve: un refugio seguro, un hogar donde pudiera soñar sin miedo. Pero para hacerlo necesitaba un lugar donde ella pudiera vivir. Ahorré cada moneda que gané en mis hazañas, vendí trofeos de guerra y trabajé incansablemente. Finalmente, conseguí una casa, un lugar al que ella podría llamar suyo. Pero la guerra estalló el día que iba a darle la noticia. Mis misiones chocaron y, en medio del caos, ella desapareció.
Busqué en todas partes, temiendo lo peor. Ningún pueblerino había ayudado a la niña que vendía flores para sobrevivir; ¿por qué lo harían ahora? Imagine su cuerpecito inerte bajo los escombros, olvidado por los débiles e inútiles druidas que no pudieron salvarla. Mis pasos eran pesados, no solo por los trofeos que llevaba, sino por el peso de mi corazón quebrado. La crueldad de esta vida no tiene límites, pero incluso en medio de la barbarie, recordé por qué empecé esta travesía. No podía rendirme.
Cuando finalmente la encontré, algo había cambiado. Ya no era la niña frágil que conocí. Tal vez era ella, o tal vez una sombra de lo que había sido. Pero adoptarla y verla sonreír nuevamente me hizo entender que nuestras acciones tienen un impacto que trasciende nuestro entendimiento. No era solo una niña sin hogar; era una oportunidad para redimir lo que quedaba de mi humanidad.
En un rincón perdido de la historia nórdica, se cuenta la leyenda de una niña huérfana que vagó sola durante años en los desiertos de hielo tras la muerte de su familia en una guerra clánica. Nadie la ayudó, nadie la quiso, hasta que un guerrero la encontró desmayada en la nieve. A pesar de su corazón endurecido por las batallas, el guerrero la llevó a su hogar y la crió como su propia hija. Con el tiempo, ella se convirtió en una gran sanadora, conocida no por las cicatrices que llevaba, sino por la paz que traía. ¿No es acaso esa la prueba de que incluso en los lugares más oscuros, hay esperanza?
Esta historia, aunque llena de tragedias y sangre, es un reflejo de nuestra propia realidad. Hoy, incluso, hay guerras que arrasan con las vidas de seres queridos. La humanidad, a lo largo de su historia, ha manchado sus manos con tinta roja, escondiendo sus crímenes bajo el velo de la victoria. Si me lees, te imploro: haz lo que puedas para Ayudar a alguien aunque sea una vez en tu vida, dándole palabras de ánimo, o un poco de comida o lo que tu corazón desee dar en ese momento, no por recompensa ni por honor, sino porque también podrías estar en sus zapatos, porque varias veces esos pensamientos rondan nuestra mente.
Me despido con un abrazo gélido, como los vientos de Skyrim, y un saludo cargado de las tragedias que he visto. Que mi historia sirva como un recordatorio de que incluso en los lugares más oscuros, la luz de la compasión puede brillar."

. | This game has immense replayability simply because the core gameplay loop of smashing rats to bits never gets old. 

It starts a little slow, I'd say just keep pushing yourself because the higher difficulties is where the real fun is at.

For such a simple premise there is a surprising amount of depth with both the character builds and the levels. Learning the secrets and getting the books is all part of learning the game, and it's an area which i think really brings people together because carrying the books or completing the puzzles has to be a group effort. 

The devs also keep adding more maps for free which is fantastic.

76561197999482693,553540,Phantom Brigade,3.2333333333333334,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",10,"This review may be updated in time, but currently, I don't really recommend this game.

From the perspective of running speed and stability, I have had absolutely no issues. The game functions and performs quite well, and aside from a few choices of keybinds being slightly awkward (I'm not a large fan of Esc not being the go-to 'back/undo' button) there isn't much to complain about in the way of functionality. Beyond how smoothly it runs, however, there isn't entirely a lot that the game has going for it.

Though the degree of customization with your mechs is nice, you barely get to see much of it in battle, and in general, since all of the models are designed to mesh with one another, the end result is that most of the designs don't actually feel all that visually distinctive or recognizable. This is fine, since the hitbox is so large on most of your units that they'll get killed either by friendly or hostile fire long before you actually get the chance to zoom in and admire how they look. In a similar vein, the pilots in the game - crew members you require to actually operate your mechs - are rather bland beyond some basic backstory text, and show no individual development or have any meaningful skills unique to them. This means that you barely feel bad - or anything at all - when one of them goes down in combat. More than anything, you just get upset at how irritating whatever mechanic that killed them is, and forget all about the fact that it was supposed to be a heartfelt character death in the first place.

A lot of the gameplay mechanics are unintuitive. Shields are hard to understand because the game doesn't teach you anything about them. The heat build up mechanic is confusing and will outright lie to you at certain points, leading to your units taking damage you didn't want them to. Sometimes, you're required to destroy a certain building to accomplish a given objective. As these buildings do not count as hostile units, you need to target the environment to destroy it. This can lead to an incomplete destruction of the target, despite it looking and seeming quite damaged, and the continued functionality of that building. Especially irritating when it is linked to enemy turrets or reinforcements that become operational moments afterward.

Certain weaponry and components are entirely overpowered, and render all other equipment and in general any form of tactics entirely pointless. Heavy beam weaponry and missiles in particular turn the game into a point and click adventure - a single unit equipped with this gear can rather mindlessly confront dozens of enemy units from afar. On the other hand, certain gear is incredibly underpowered or confusing to wield - and you only realize this after trying to use it for the first time and losing a valuable unit as a result. Often, balancing hardly depends on the difficulty, but rather on if one of your poor units ends up being accidentally caught up in an overpowered weapon's field of fire, whether that be from an allied or enemy unit's hands.

There isn't much to offer in the way of gameplay expansion. Once you've experienced combat in the first few areas and captured your first territory, you've basically seen it all. Aside from minor upgrades here and there to your equipment (most of which are meager in nature), there isn't much to enjoy if you aren't heads over tails for the gameplay loop as it's immediately introduced to you in the tutorial.

I love the idea of Phantom Brigade, so here's to hoping that I'm convinced otherwise of what I've stated here by future experience - or by any changes made by the developers going forward. | If you like mech combat, this will scratch that itch.  If I were to describe the gameplay, I would say it's a mix of Battletech, XCOM, and Heavy Gear.  Actual combat is fun, and runs smooth.  There's a large variety of gear to mix and match.  

However I do have some minor nit-picking to do.  As large as the campaign map is, combat maps are limited in number.  The actual pilot you put in a mech doesn't matter, the pilots themselves don't level up.  Mission type variety is also a bit limited.  One mechanic that isn't explained at all is how collisions work, but once you figure it out, it's fun to bulldoze enemy mechs.

Overall, I'd say it's worth your time if you're a stompy robot fan. | Dynamic and spectacular battles, especially in urban environments when buildings catch stray fire.

Interesting and varied missions that encourage mech loadout experimentation.

Friendly fire adds satisfying tactical depth.

The soundtrack by Riley Koenig was good enough for me to find it streaming on Spotify.

Some familiar mechanics for players of BattleTech or other mech games e.g. managing heat buildup and dissipation, attacking from certain angles to optimize location-based damage, dashing with thrusters.

Spoiler: [spoiler]the first boss battle was also an unexpected and cool surprise. Kudos to the designers for making the boss fight mechanics work seamlessly in the same system as the rest of the game.[/spoiler]

(Just an observation: I think the current Steam Store banner image, screenshots, and videos undersell how crazy battles can get with swarms of missiles, collapsing high-rise buildings and bridges, and exploding tanks and mechs. The physics is also incredibly well done!

I've also fought battles larger than that marketing content suggests: so far my biggest was 9 units versus 13 (not including battles with  enemy convoy/tank swarms)) | One of the kind tactical gameplay.
But any strategy progression is actually pointless. Everything is auto leveled to player squad, so there is no possibility of getting ahead the enemy in any capacity. You progress only to catch to enemy in power, not to overpower them.
Needs rework. Or atleast mod disabling autolevel mechanics. | Amazing mech game, underdog setting and stealing everything that isn't nailed down. What more do you need?

Would love to see this game get continued support and more love in the future, wouldn't say no to a proper expansion even."
76561197999482693,553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,2.066666666666667,Action,7,"Friendly and supportive fan base, fun game play, and devs that seem to value community fun and engagement over immediate profits. It really does bring the full package | You know the developers know what they're doing when right click closes out menus...

In all seriousness, easily one of the most fun games I've ever played. The overall game-feel is stellar, from the movement / physics / gun-feel / atmosphere / lighting / music / enemy diversity. The emergent gameplay is always a good time. And then you take into account the (currently) 3 different enemy rosters (Terminids / Automatons / Illuminate) that all feel so different to go up against, it helps keep things fresh. Fair warning the remainder of this is an anecdotal rambling as I think of things.

The overall live service aspect has been great, with the addition of new weapons to try out, the new faction to go up against (at the time of writing Illuminate has been out a little while now). My most favourite recent addition was the FRV vehicle (jeep) which is a blast to hoon around the planets on. If only we had a means to flip them back over when you eventually take a tumble and land on your roof! But I guess it rewards careful driving!

The devs have been transparent with their direction, and balance passes have for the most part been in our favour (aside from one, which was not long after reverted). I've been playing since launch and whilst there initially were some hiccups in terms of bugs/crashes etc I really can't complain currently. I was initially playing on a 1060/8700K, so for all intents and purposes I had to bump everything way down to make it playable. Since upgrading to a 4070S/7800X3D and I must say it looks gorgeous and runs smoothly. It's been a good while since I've crashed. There's the occasional bug here and there no pun intended, but they've slowly been getting squashed as time goes on. The latest one I noticed was occasionally the FRV tires being blown out, but still showing as fine, nothing game breaking.

I'm a sucker for the grind, so it's nice to have the ability to find the super credits to get the warbonds for free (aside from the time, but it's time well spent having fun). The early game was fun unlocking all of the different stratagems and ship upgrades. The late game is a grind for samples for the latter upgrades, and then the gradual hunt for the super credits is the slow trickle until the next warbond drops. I'm 2 levels away from the current levelcap of 150 around 560 hours deep, which for the sake of clarity is pretty much for bragging rights only, there are no benefits of leveling past around level 30. Early on stratagems are level gated, after that it just gives you player titles.

Difficulty-wise, the difficulty progression was good. Early on you get slowly introduced to the enemy and mission types. i.e. tier 3 difficulty might task you with killing a charge or a bile titan, whereas in a tier 9 they're just an enemy that you can be pitted up against multiple times throughout a mission. Plenty of side objectives to complete on later difficulties to min-max xp. Missions are timed, ~40 minutes for a standard main mission or ~12 minutes for the smaller scale 'kill the waves of enemies' ones. But don't let that put you off, it's the whole 'gunning it to extract, to escape the horde' moments that are part of what make this game great. The current highest difficulty (10) can have it's intense moments, but with a competent team, they're very much doable. For the most part I currently have been sticking to 9's, but even then, sometimes the game director decides you're going to have a bad day. However not as drastic as say, everything going wrong all at once on Darktide.
Difficulty levels are unlocked by completing a chain of 3 of the previous difficulty. I.e. completing 3 tier 5 missions unlocks tier 6, and so on. With each chain being locked to whichever planet you want to play on.

The environments are nice and varied. For those unaware, each mission takes place in a circular area of the particular planet you choose to dive onto. Each planet has a different biome, think desert dunes / snow / snow with ice / jungle / rolling hills, that kind of thing. There are modifiers per planet, so maybe one has earthquakes that occur so often, one might have an EMP style weather effect that makes you unable to call in stratagems for a short time. Another might have blizzards, or sandstorms, etc. With the Illuminate being added the planets they're on have some urban environments, which is a nice shift. The areas aren't gigantic, but they're not tiny (aside from the intentionally small levels for wave-defense / elimination mission types). Up until the FRV vehicle dropped, we were on foot (aside from slow lumbering single person mechs), and it didn't feel bad running from objective to objective. The different point of interest keep things interesting as you might be hunting around for supercredits, samples and even just ammo if you're running low.

The stratagem system is really solid. The call in method of d-pad/arrow key is great. I would definitely recommend any new keyboard players to rebind their stratagem inputs to the arrow keys so that you can WASD run with your left hand and mash out call-ins with your left. Sounds kinda janky but trust me it's pretty much mandatory late game when you're getting overrun. The stratagems themselves are wonderfully varied. From the eagle strikes (think strafing runs, bombs, rockets etc) to orbitals (barrages, railcannons, precision strikes) to turrets (gatlings, mortars, flames, lightning towers). Then there are all of the different types of heavy weapons you can call in (LMG, HMG, autocannon, rocket launchers etc) the list goes on. Much of the variety from the game comes down to your loadout choices i.e. maybe you want to focus on burning everything, sure, use a call-down flamethrower, napalm strikes and an orbital that calls down armageddon for your foes (and your team if you're not careful!). 

Multiplayer is great with friends or randoms. The comm-wheel removes necessity for verbal comms if you're so inclined, but my overall experience has been a positive one. The emergent and often triumphant comradery with randoms makes it a joy to play. It's a rare sight coming across those with malicious intent. Disclaimer there is friendly fire, but most of it is accidental (and often hilariously so). I could probably count on one hand the times I've dealt with griefers in 500+ hours. And even then, if you're hosting, you can always kick them. And if someone was to kick you, you get put back into your own instance now, so you don't lose any of the samples etc the team collected (so long as you can then extract). 

Helldivers 2 is steeped in satire, and doesn't take itself too too seriously. The over the top super earth anthem, the crazed battlecries as you murder hundreds of giant bugs. This goes hand-in-hand with the physics based combat which can lead to some funny moments. One time I tossed a grenade down a bug-hole to destroy it, then a stalker (big invisible bug) rushed me from behind, flicking me into said bug hole with said grenade, killing me instantly when it exploded. Not even mad. | 非常好的游戏，虽然经常闪退，但是能正常游玩的时间也已经是超过DEV你妈的寿命了。 | Played my first game with a friend. Accidently joined a team of rando's, had no idea what was going on. Incredibly, I screamed, cried and ragdolled my way to the pickup zone with their help and through the good grace of Democracy. When the airship came down for pickup, it killed me instantly. Clear as a bell a voice rang out ""Oh no, you got squashed."" Realised my mic was on the whole time. 10/10 | [h3] 游戏的核心玩法是否有趣？ [/h3]

The influence is undeniable, and I could feel its spirit seeping through the gameplay. The campaign offers a solid, well-structured experience, while the multiplayer delivers the standard fare you’d expect from an RTS. That, in essence, is the theme of this game—it doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it delivers a polished and well-executed version of familiar mechanics.

My biggest gripe is the unit design. Many units look too similar, which can make it difficult to differentiate them at a glance. Additionally, the two main factions, while distinct in playstyle, share a somewhat uniform aesthetic, which makes them feel less visually unique than they could be.

On the positive side, the game excels in its command and control mechanics. The speed at which you can build, group, and maneuver your forces is impressive. The V key will quickly become your best friend, as it allows you to form cohesive armies that support one another effectively. However, the attack-move function can be a bit frustrating—frontline units will engage while those in the rear sometimes idle instead of pushing forward. The best workaround is to avoid attack-move and instead overshoot your target, ensuring your forces spread out and engage as intended.

If you find Ashes of the Singularity on sale and have a soft spot for Supreme Commander, it’s absolutely worth picking up. I’ve had a great time with it, and despite some minor flaws, it delivers an enjoyable large-scale RTS experience. | I wish more games would take this approach its simple but not halo wars simple(love that game too btw). | Once you get the hang of it, it is fun. Gives you that old Total Annihilation feel. Definitely a rts I have been hunting to play since beating all of the Supreme Commander games. | Sah auf den ersten Blick nicht schlecht aus, spielt sich aber leider nicht wirklich gut.

- Die Kampagne ist lahm
- Die gesamte Aufmachen, Videosequenzen, Story, Ingamegrafik, alles wirkt billig
- Die Einheiten sind nutzlos, alles unausgereift. Kaum Taktikmöglichkeiten, im Grunde geht's nur darum einen Haufen von allem zu machen, alles zusammenzuwürfeln und auf den Gegner zu werfen
- Basenbau, Ressourcenabbau, Verteidigungsanlagen, alles sehr simpel und langweilig

Leider auch wieder eine Enttäuschung unter den modernen RTS. | Gives me Supreme Commander type vibes"

A quick search shows that this is a widespread issue, one must research and follow guides in order to get the game to work. 

The ""patch"" that ""fixed"" this in September, did in fact not fix this, as can be seen by the comments in the discussions for that patch as of January. 

One should not have to crash multiple times and follow unofficial advice scattered across the internet and add launch commands just to try the game. | This game is a real gem, especially if you let yourself play It at the ""slow"" speed. At normal speed, these vast cathedral ships are wheeling and careening more like fighters, but at slow, you can admire the vast clash of leviathans, line up torpedo shots, or just enjoy the visuals. 

Now, if you are looking for an accurate 3d space combat game, this isn't it. It's not tactically realistic to space combat, and pretends that space combat would be on a plane. But when you have flying space cathedrals in a game, I don't think the developers are exactly shooting for realism. This is basically a naval dreadnought combat game in space. And it works. 

The strategy is varied and can be as complex as you want it to be. The factions have significant variety, leading to vastly different play styles across the different campaigns. You can optimize fleet composition to fit your play style, whether through focusing on maximizing boarding operations to crit your enemy ships to death, torpedoes if you are feeling lucky and want to take down their capital ships quickly, lances if you want long distance accuracy to ship down enemies while they can't even see you, macro batteries if you want to grapple at broadside difference, etc. etc. This has all the fundamentals you would want in a tactical game, such as: 

-The orientation of ships matters, both for the angle at which your ship can fire broadsides, and because some ships have far more armor in some places than others. 
-Ship movement varies considerably across the factions, but in each case you need to be thoughtful about when you are moving fast and when  you are moving slowly. 
-You can focus fire on a particular part of the enemy ship, so it's not just a matter of beating down an HP bar. Combo this focus of fire with a couple boarding parties, and you can make an enemy ship worthless, even if it has full health.

This game is even better with the Skalgrim mod, which lets you scale up the battles by about a factor of five, making the fleet combat even better.

-Tactical Gameplay: 9/10
-Grand Strategy Gameplay: 4/10 (really just an interface for setting up battles, to be honest)

As much as I hate having to adjust my latest gaming setup to a game that came out in 2019, Battlefleet Gothic Armada 2 is one of my favorite strategy games. The campaign can be unforgivably long if you customize the fleet sizes and economy beforehand, but its clear a lot of love and effort went into its development to make it worthwhile. If I had to choose between playing this or Gladius, BFGA2 wins easily. Its a very niche RTS, but one I'll occasionally come back to. | This game was my entry point to the WH40k world. If you have the patience to fix the potential crash issues some users are having, I highly recommend the game. It is very fun, although a bit too easy imo, but the fun thing is you can make it as hard as you want with the settings they have in the game.  Every faction so far feels vastly different from each other and I still haven't even finished all 4 campaigns. I do agree that it can get a bit repetitive at the end game, but it's still good fun. 

One area I would improve is the planet management, as right now there is none. | i can finally help humanity on its manifest destiny mission to the stars, taking their rightful place as the inheritors of all things"
76561197999482693,573410,AI War 2,0.03333333333333333,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",0,"It is a very deep and genre-bending game.  It has elements of grand strategy, real-time straegy, tower-defense,  and some roguelike randomizations.  The game can be customized in an absurd amount of ways to change up the gameplay, difficulty, etc. 

Lots of great real-time strategy games have a campaign that is a series of fixed battles.  Wouldn't it be fun if you could actually control the strategic situation in a game like Command and Conquer, choosing where the battles are fought and for what objective?  You can do that here!

Have you ever played a grand strategy game like Europa Universalis and wished you could have tactical control of the individual units during a battle?  You can do that in this game!  

It really does blend the strategic and tactical elements very nicely for a challenging and tense experience with lots of interesting strategic choices to make.

My one criticism is that modern UI standards are out the window for this game, it seems to be all home-baked which is impressive in a way but also a hassle.  Click a unit to select it.  Want to see the details?  Hold down 'C' and click it.  Not so horrible, just tons of weird hotkeys and strange ways of using them that are unintuitive and hard to remember.   I'm really looking forward to their next game and I hope the UI gets some love. | Good game, need to stick with it. | Great game | I like space fight:)"
76561197999482693,578650,The Outer Worlds,15.666666666666666,RPG,11,"I was expecting more from the developers of Fallout 3: New Vegas. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the game is the storyline, as the ending was not particularly engaging, to say the least.
I would not describe The Outer Worlds as an open-world game, as it is more of a collection of static locations that the player navigates between through the loading screen. While players can complete different quests in any order, each quest is still linear in nature.
Very few decisions made by the player have a significant impact on the game world, with only the scenes before the end credits being affected. 
Many characters in the game are portrayed in a manner that is similar to real-life, which can lead to a sense of realism, but also limits the player's freedom of choice and instead feels more like a questionnaire about their attitudes towards certain characters.
The game's graphics are interesting and subtly resemble those of Borderlands, adding a touch of humor and a sense of cartoonishness that is generally fun and more of a positive than a negative aspect. | Недавно я прошёл The Outer Worlds и должен сказать, что эта довольно дешёвая игра Obsidian понравилась мне больше, чем двадцатилетняя идея Тодда Говарда, которая обошлась Bethesda в 200 миллионов долларов. Я даже думал сделать видос, но чего-то полноценный сценарий у меня не идёт, и поэтому делюсь своими впечатлениями тут.

Что понравилось:
• Квесты довольно классные и разнообразные. В них всегда есть какая-то интересная история, и порой в финале даже есть внезапный поворот. Причём DLC, мне кажется, получились ещё лучше, но тут ещё играет то, что я обожаю детективы.
• В игре очень большая вариативность. Присутствует это как в квестах, так и в геймплее. У тебя всегда есть множество вариантов для прохождения, и в этом плане проект даже напоминает какой-то иммёрсив-сим. После Veilguard, где от RPG одно название, проходить The Outer Worlds было очень освежающе.
• Классные компаньоны. Мне особенно сильно понравился бортовой ИИ Ада, которая не понимает сарказма и медик Элли. Даже жаль, что никого романсить нельзя, ибо я бы не отказался.
• Юмор очень субъективная вещь, но лично я от него тут получил удовольствие. Многие ситуации специально сделаны комичными, и это прям классно.

Что не понравилось:
• Боевая система явно не лучшая. Я не могу назвать её какой-то ужасной, но особой изюминки в ней нет. Тем более боёв в игре очень много, и к концу я старался избегать ненужных перестрелок.
• Города не чувствуются живыми. Сами локации красивые и атмосферные, но вот их жители не могут похвастаться проработкой. Из-за этого отчасти рушится погружение, ведь ты понимаешь, что это обычная декорация.

The Outer Worlds – это вполне хорошая игра. У неё есть определённые недостатки, но они по большей части связаны с ограниченным бюджетом разработчиков. Я очень надеюсь, что при поддержке Майков у них получится их исправить. Посмотрим уже в этом году. | Can't really compete with similar games in the genre that got a larger budget, and I have to say that for a game frequently touted for ""anticapitalist"" themes it was disappointingly moderate, but worth at least one playthrough. Parvati is the best asexual character I've seen in ANY video game and her side mission is adorable. | Fallout New Vegas was not directly created by Bethesda. They let another studio make it using the engine from Fallout 3. THIS game is from that other studio, and it shows. Only it is in an ultra-capitalist space dystopia instead of nuclear wasteland. It is vault tech, if vault tech was still alive and saying those stupid ideas directly to your face. 

The guts are a fallout game- durability, looting, wandering, skill points, base stats. The game is not a single map, and instead various smaller maps across the solar system. So things are more fenced in than NV. This might turn some people off. They replace VATs with a bullettime mechanic. 

While the game has the same companions and ""lone wolf"" perk mechanics, there is a third option- you can just turn your companions ""off"". They can be passive- they don't attack, they can't be targeted. They just sit there, providing banter, passive skill bonuses, and maybe a quest interaction or two. Perfect for those that want to do all the content themselves, but miss hearing the assholes in your party bickering. 

The upgrade system is a bit of a pain. You have typical mods for small bonuses. But the raw damage is determined by item level. It costs money to raise an item's level, and it scales exponentially based off of how many levels you raise it. Higher tier weapons are not qualitatively different from regular weapons- they just start off at a higher level, so you need less steps to raise it. 

As a result, unique weapons are a bit of a flop- no reason to raise that nice sniper pistol from the starting a full +30 levels. However, unique armor is great, since you are getting it for skill bonuses to pass checks. yes- you will be changing into your persuasion suit before you talk to anyone. 

Edition note- ""Spacer's choice"" edition is not compatible with saves from the base game. It is mostly a graphics update that also removes the level cap. DLC unlocks content in both versions of the game. So it is best to start off with Spacer's choice if you feel you are ever going to go for that. | Everything that fallout should be, brought to you by the studio that made the best fallout game, Obsidian. Even if I did not like the game, which I do, I would support them because their company practices are admirable. Hearty recommendation, cant wait for Outer Worlds 2"
76561197999482693,586140,BlazBlue Centralfiction,0.0,Action,0,"Probably the game with the most unique characters ever for a fighting game.

It's not the fanciest or in depth shooter ever, but it's fun, funny, action packed, quick paced, and just the right level of challenging. | Rogue Legacy concept except in first person, while on paper it sounds interesting the execution is horrendous. Since this is fps every arena / room is in 3D and some rooms are full of heavy hazards that can actually end your run pretty quick, unlike in Rogue Legacy where destroying urns/vases you can get consumable[s] in this game there is no such thing, sure there are plenty of urns and vases and destroying them nothing drops out. Since this is fps game your weapons have ammunition that depletes but it is so scarce that you cant have enough of it to complete room and instead of game giving you ammo it gives new weapon which you don't want. You would think that using melee could help here, but the fact that melee does not exist in this game is stupid.

Bottom line. 
Play Rogue Legacy instead or find better rogue like shooter.👎

想到《社会学的意识》序言里的一个观点：所有的思想和主义都是给思想上的进步添砖加瓦，真正拎出一个完美无缺的意识形态是不可能的事情。可是一个想法即便再烂，在与其他的做对比、与这个世界互相尝试配合对方的时候都是很迷人的。无论人类多么渺小，思想多么如同麦粒般微不足道，在历史车轮上刻下的痕迹积攒起来都足够让后人津津乐道。

瑞瓦肖也是如此，种种思想交织杂烩。遭遇苦难的人要真需要找个凶手，那其实整个世界都是凶手。为了权力和生活的工贼团，为了洗去传统的工人主义犯罪帮，心系天下也目中无人的康米主义者，听起来像是疯了的思想反倒让他们感到自洽和幸福的种族主义、法西斯主义者和封建贵族阶级拥护者，为人摆布的小女孩...还有我，闪耀于炮火弹坑之上的明星警探，是酒鬼也是伟大的婴儿。就算是纯粹的善意，经过了语言壁垒的剥削也只剩下刻薄和轻飘飘。对于在乱世没有对任何地方有归属感的人来说，危险和安全只是不同的伤害他们的方式。

只有所有人的痛苦都在各自发出声响的时候，世界看起来才是最悲惨和现实的。所有人都在表达自己渺小、错误百出却仍有贡献的愿望和想法的时候，世界才是最快乐和讽刺的。对于这个游戏来说，我寻找到一个主义并不断追求是对它想表达的情感的亵渎。因此，混乱和迷茫才是体验它的最好方式。 | No matter what I write about Disco Elysium it will never be enough to justify how beautiful this game is.
 
You are a drunk man, a cop that is tasked with solving a murder and along the way you discover yourself and discover where do you belong on the socio-politcal spectrum.

You get a great feel for the BT universe, even if things are hokey, cliche, silly, or weird. That's BT, baby!

Improvements: Autocannons are now useful and damage is more balanced. Stability is a fun mechanic and helps with the big boys. AC/2s are actually interesting! The game is quick, and running a melee-build Grasshopper is always hella fun. The initiative system is fine for getting things moving, and the pilot specializations are mostly good, though some are clear superior standouts (like less damage, better initiative, and heat-dumping).

Neutral things: Lance size, map size, visibility, and scouting are all made for the game... which means they often are small or not nearly to the scale people hoped for. Long range weapons are usually only good for their other benefits (headcappers, stability) because visibility is short. Maps are repetitive, as are missions, though there's only so many ways you can generate mission types on a game like this. The Argo is pure protagonist magic, as is the DropShip-to-DropShip rule-breaking FLT, but that was a way to keep lance sizes to 4 'mechs. Reinforcements always show up in a prescribed location to be in the way, which is sometimes ridiculous (8 assault mechs pounding one of yours into scrap always feels arbitrary when they just showed up and zoomed into the initiative).

Bad things: The generated pilot pictures, including your character, look like ass. The Kickstarter and backer ones are much better. There's no true mercenary campaign mode with a Union or something; you can always haul as much gear, mechs, and parts as you want, even on the Leopard. The game pushes you to heavier and heavier mechs through the campaign and the post-campaign missions; the Flashpoints are much better, but you often need the money from the heavy missions to fund that scrap heap of a DropShip. ComStar would have blown the Argo out of the sky as soon as you got it up, let alone when you start finding Clan Wolverine things. Some mechs are clearly superior (all the ones from Heavy Metal), so you use those much more. Why use a Catapult when an Archer lobs missiles better? Why touch a scout mech when you can drive an Assassin and be untouchable?

All in all, an awesome, fun game. I hope Battletech 2, if it ever happens, puts you in the Chaos March as a true mercenary, similar to MechCommander 2 or some of the MechWarrior 5 Mercenary stuff. That would truly be baller. | This game is good fun! I especially enjoy the Battletech Advanced and Roguetech mods, although the game engine struggles to run them well. | Не зашла. Пробовал начинать раза четыре. Не идет. Не затягивает. Вроде как задумка не плохая. Но чего то в ней не хватает. Возможно попытки с десятой, если бы разобрался бы во всем. Скорее всего резюме такое - ""Есть игры лучше. Время играть во все подряд мало. Из за этого нет смысла играть в то, что хуже."" | Base game + DLC is a decent value - good range of mechs, solid story, gameplay is basically tabletop lite. I'd recommend it to anyone with any interest in tactics-style games. But where it REALLY shines is the sheer number of mods, and mod support. Even more mechs, support vehicles, and later in the timeline, so you get plenty of Clan and even WoB tech.

I enjoyed it quite a bit without mods, but with mods, I really fell in love. | Think of this like MW2:Mercenaries but in a style of turn base combat. Gameplay is super nice, visuals are equally as good, but the main story, and that of its writing are just meh."

76561197999482693,646570,Slay the Spire,42.15,"Indie, Strategy",20,"My first 500 hours in Slay the Spire were hours I didn't pay for. 

I was a kid in highschool, broke, there was only 3 characters in the game, Vine was alive and Tiktok had yet to really get a foothold in the world. It was a better time.

And I... sailed the seas. Its not something I'm ashamed of, and if you are down on your luck, still a kid, or just don't feel like jockeying the Steam refund policy to see if you like a game, most game devs would prefer thats how you play their game over buying a copy of dubious origin from a reseller. 

Why even bring this up, you might ask? Well, it was only last year that I realized how much had gone into the game, and that there was a 4th character that I had no clue even existed. And, against my better judgement with regards to my ever disappearing free time, I picked up STS again to try that 4th character. And then I started playing the other characters too. And then I started ascension runs. 

Never in all my days have I encountered such a well crafted deckbuilder. Being singleplayer, STS doesn't care if you find a combo that breaks the game and makes the enemy unable to interact with you. Slay the Spire doesn't try and limit your ceiling, it dares you to go infinite, it [i] wants [/i] you to go infinite. My favorite part of the game is how it encourages offense while putting more than enough wrinkles in your path that you can't just go full zerg rush. Fully indexing into any one thing without accounting for the counters puts you on the path to losing. 

Learning the Watcher, the illusive 4th character I didn't know existed as it got added after I put my 500 [strike] pirated [/strike] pre-purchase hours in has been one of the most enjoyable deckbuilding experiences I've had since... well since I played STS the first time. 

The main thing I was trying to do on the Watcher that was so fun was going infinite. There was a really interesting play pattern you can take where you reset a lot and chop your deck down to like 3 powers and then your 2 card combo that goes until you win. The fun part is that by taking your deck down to so few cards, any enemy that adds cards to your deck in any way is immediately the most threatening thing you could encounter. You also have to make illogical decisions in order to get to infinite. You skip like 90% of cards you are offered, you make sacrifices for some things that would never make sense in a normal run. And that is just ONE way to play the game on one character, completely ignoring everything that comes with ascension runs. 

And all of that is also completely ignoring everything that isn't purely gameplay. The art is amazing, the soundtrack is amazing, the sound DESIGN is amazing, and there has never been a better time to get into Slay the Spire because there is a sequel that looks like its amping up everything about the first game and giving more of what is undeniably one of the grandpappys of indie roguelikes. That would've been a silly statement 10 years ago, but there are so many indie roguelikes now that it can be hard to stand out among them. 

Slay the Spire has stood the test of time and remains at the top of the tower. Play this game, and if you can, uh, pay for it while you're at it... I did. Eventually.

---致我人生第一次玩的卡牌肉鸽神作《杀戮尖塔》
前几日冬促，购买了《杀戮尖塔》这款游戏，在玩之前心里曾想：我玩过那么多个3A大作，怎能会被一个小小的卡牌游戏震撼呢？看着steam好评如潮的评价，心里抱着不理解和尝试的态度，还是打开了游戏。

没错，我摊牌了，我彻底被这个游戏折服，从买完游戏到现在我无时不刻都在玩，目前也差不多一百小时了，如此优秀的游戏玩法和质量已经能超越很多3A大作。

再玩之前，我也确实久仰杀戮尖塔在卡牌肉鸽当中的地位，但是我也确实从来没玩过卡牌肉鸽，《杀戮尖塔》也属于我在肉鸽类游戏中的白月光了吧。确实只有在实际上手之后才能感受到其中的魅力。从最开始的重开在商店里找好遗物，到现在稍微有些对删牌过卡的理解，这种不完全依赖随机而是能够在游戏局内运营、构筑卡牌的机制正是它的魅力所在。同时四个角色特色迥异，相同角色又因为不同的牌组构筑有着不同的打法，再加上几乎毫无门槛的操作，在roguelike游戏的重开-学习的过程中，低挫败感、高成就感、对卡牌的熟悉以及逐渐对角色的理解使得游戏过程不像通常的卡牌roguelike，而更加有趣，能取舍是否该拿牌、是否该移除卡牌、接下来又该怎么构筑，这使该游戏的可重复游玩性大大增加。


前些天终于用战士，猎人和鸡煲把心脏打通关了，也算是对这游戏有些浅薄的理解了

开始玩这游戏的时候，好哥们建议我先玩鸡煲，说是鸡煲转起来特别强，而我也感受到了。

后来哥们和我说，玩战士得学会烧牌，我很诧异，明明每张牌都是我精挑细选的，为什么要把他们烧掉呢？后面理解了，把效率低的卡烧掉后，留下单卡效率最高的卡，打怪效率更高。之后喜欢上了烧牌的感觉，尤其很喜欢腐化，当把其他牌烧干净后，只剩下那几张攻击牌，颇有种破釜沉舟的感觉，就算打不过再sl嘛，把不该烧的牌留下来。

当我研究战士烧牌的时候，我认为战士是一个最需要想象力的职业，玩的时候得靠想象力。

关于杀戮尖塔的赞美太多太多了，我不想去赞美游戏的本身。我印象最深刻的一局是战士第一次打败心脏，因为卡组不太好，强度不高。我腐化黑拥SL一个小时二十次，结局依旧是输。我相信我能赢，我把29张牌牌序列出来，腐化黑拥烧完不同的牌牌序列出来，一个小时后我终于找到了那个解，最后我赢了之后长舒一口气。在那一刻我赢了游戏，在那一刻也赢了时间。或许一个小时我重开一局选牌好早赢了，可是能赢的局我不愿认输。


即使最后我们都会输给时间，这没关系，那也要谱写出每个人自己生命的赞歌。什么是生命的赞歌？或许是藏在人们骨子里的永不屈服、永不妥协、永不认输。

我的人生没办法sl，为了战胜这一路上的小怪，烧过那么多休息牌，娱乐牌，还换了那么多血，这是否真的值得？可惜这个问题的答案没法通过sl去知道了。
现在的我，就想赶快走到下一个篝火休息。人生啊，总是奔向下一个篝火，区别是以前的我会在篝火敲牌，以后我只会休息了。

最后感谢《杀戮尖塔》给我带来一百小时的快乐时光，我现在唯一后悔的就是在大学期末考试期间购买了这款游戏，这游戏真的有瘾啊！😭 | 又开始带鸡煲节奏了我真是服了😅鸡煲是这个游戏唯一的完美职业，已经和尖塔融为一体，成了尖塔的底层逻辑，成名绝技偏差认知给尖塔带来了这个贴吧最经典的话题，创造了尖塔的黄金时代，诋毁鸡煲，你想毁了杀戮尖塔吗？
 | Dangerous dangerous game, whether you are playing it on the go via tablet or have it on steam maybe with mods as well, if this is the right game for you your free time will evaporate. If you like deckbuilding, pve strategy and the like, this is just perfect. If you've got a background in competitive/multiplayer collectable card games, the pve nature of slay the spire enabling you to do some truly unbalanced things will make you ecstatic

If you're thinking of ""why bother getting this game when Slay the Spire 2 is going to come out soon?"", well this is already one of the best games of all time, don't be silly. | 仅仅是打了个全成就 ，仍然无法全面的评价这个游戏。因为这100个小时里仅仅专精了猎人，还有三个职业只是简单玩了玩。
真的有点惊叹于游戏的设计，仅仅四个角色，仅仅三个区域（算上心脏四个）却可以让一个游戏有着如此大的可玩性。看似重复的遭遇和地图，随着局内带来的各种惊喜（多种多样的道具，卡组搭配，药水选择，随机事件等）和精妙的设计（数值的平衡和关卡的平衡）可以说再玩几百个小时都不会觉得腻。而且这还是我没去更深体验其他三个角色和增加可玩性的mod时的想法。
体验下来确实可以说无与伦比，极其出色的游戏（又到幸运时刻了，今年出2！）"

 | Great game. The story mode is very diverse, the gameplay is amazing, and the character designs are just *Chef's kiss* | O jogo é muito bom, é uma pena que eu tenha que comprar muitos personagens com dinheiro real, eles deveriam botar a opção de desbloquear os personagens no modo história que nem no storm 4, o jogo é bom mas não é melhor que o Dragon Ball Sparking Zero"

76561197999482693,596970,Sunless Skies: Sovereign Edition,87.3,"Adventure, Indie, RPG",20,"Sunless Skies is the definitive answer to the question ""What game you like but not sure you can recommend?""

Imagine reading a VERY interesting book, but every chapter or so you have to throw the book across the room and go pick it up to continue read it, and sometime you throw it too hard or too far so have to read the book from the start again. But if you can stick to it, the book is worth it.

If you like reading, game atmosphere and don't mind A LOT of fetch quests, you can enjoy this game. | If you don't like to read, skip this game. If you are interested play Sunless sea before this one, or get a bit into the fallen London setting with lore dumps on youtube, so you have a chance to understand whats going on. Then grab the monarch mod pack on nexus, which is just a really good vanilla-ish add on, includes a lot of extra gear and modules that make the gameplay better at the cost of very little polish. Then loose yourself and enjoy. | the core concept of the game, an RPG that spans 'generations' as your captains die, is kind of interesting. the application is endless fetch quests, pretentious writing, tedious combat, and difficult to track storylines as every character is 'named' with a descriptor + noun combination (""the incautious driver,"" for instance). getting the same RNG ""skill checks"" constantly because someone saw a spooky enemy that you've killed thirty times already just makes the entire experience more tiring. | Literally fantastic. Very long, but soooooooo good! I have even more hours put into the game than I have recorded on steam and I'd argue that I'm still barely scratching the surface! | It's a good book, but a terrible game. 

You can lose 8+ hours on a single coin flip (or worse odds) at which point you'll have to play those 8+ hours again to get to the same point and potentially lose again! You'll find yourself doing the same trade route for hours straight, just to get enough money to buy food and fuel to get to a new area. It really is a game of unrelenting patience for minimal payoff."
76561197999482693,691790,Arcadian Atlas,0.65,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",1,"Arcadian Atlas is to Final Fantasy Tactics what Mighty Number 9 was to Mega Man.

Bottom line up front: If you like Final Fantasy Tactics, you'll probably be drawn in on this game, and you'll probably even enjoy it. That's what drew me in, and it is why I ultimately did enjoy this game - but that comes with a lot of caveats. Only recommended for strategy RPG fanatics with a lot of patience.
The game has a lot of great concepts that just aren't executed well. Steam is rife with games that believed that ""imitation is the sincerest form of flattery"" but missed the second part of Wilde's quote: ""... that mediocrity can pay to greatness."" This is definitely a case of mediocrity aggressively flattering greatness.
Pro: The story has some Game of Thrones and FFT style intrigue, which is great if you're into that sort of thing - and, let's be real, if you're not into that, why would you even look at this game? It's not as deep as a lot of other games but the story is generally pretty interesting. There's a civil war going due to a succession crisis, and this all eventually takes a backseat to ""the wrong person"" getting ahold of the titular Arcadian Atlas, which grants the user incredible power through the use of magical cards. Pretty standard post-Game of Thrones fantasy stuff, honestly. 
Con: The issue is that Final Fantasy Tactics, and a lot of other RPGs like The Witcher and frankly the entire Ivalice Alliance series just did it better. The political intrigue is kind of interesting but it never gets past the ""wicked stepmother"" plot mixed with ""star-crossed lovers on opposite sides of a conflict"" cliche. It's like our writers understood that political conflict in fantasy is popular without understanding ""why"" it's popular. 
Pro: You know how, in Final Fantasy Tactics, Delita just buggers off after the end of the first chapter and the next time you see him, he's in golden armor and leading holy knights? And you wished you could've seen this low-born boy rise to power through backstabbing and manipulation? Well, Arcadian Atlas actually does give you the chance to play as their Delita analog in some chapters so you can see how things are going on the other side of the conflict.
Con: The characters just aren't very interesting. Where Final Fantasy Tactics had TG Cid, the conflicted old veteran who can still kick every ass in Ivalice, this game has Wulff, who is frankly dull as a stale bread. Desmond's got nothing on Delita. Vashti isn't nearly as interesting as Ramza. Lucretia and Valenza are more fleshed out than Dukes Larg and Goltana, though, so they've got that going for them, but, once again, Final Fantasy Tactics just did it better. There's a long plot thread about some deep dark secret that one of the characters has that just seems to go nowhere. And then there's a wizard who seems like he might end up really interesting... and then he dies. 
Pro: The battle system is pretty easy to master if you're good at Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem. The way characters level is also pretty innovative, too - everyone who participates in a battle auto-levels once the battle is won, and this even includes every named or ""special"" character in your group, whether they played or not - usually. Sometimes the game forgets to level one of those guys, which can lead to a story character (like Poncho) suddenly gaining three levels after one battle so he can catch up to the rest of the team. 
Con: The leveling system does not allow you to grind, which isn't really a problem since the game is pretty easy, but it's annoying that it basically puts your characters on rails no matter what you do. It incentivizes going for decapitation strikes since you get the same stuff at the end of every battle anyway.
Steam is lousy with ""tribute"" games. Some are great in their own right, like Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night with its homage to the Metroidvania Castlevania games. Some are meh, like Mighty Number 9 and its homage to Mega Man. This falls somewhere in the middle. At the end of the day, if you're jonesing for Final Fantasy Tactics or a Fire Emblem game and can't get either one, and you're sad that Shining Force is about to get de-listed on the Mega Drive Classics page, check this game out - but wait until it's on a Steam sale. | This is the first time I've played an indie tactic RPG, and I've gotta say it left a great impression. While the game isn't without flaws, I enjoyed it from start to finish. The writing is really the strong point in Arcadian Atlas. There were surprising twists as well as plot developments I may have guessed at but played out in ways I didn't expect. The ending brought me to tears, and I always have respect when a story can tug on my heartstrings that well. Despite it being a fairly short game (Steam says 21 hours for me but my save file says 17), I really felt connected to the main protagonists and their story, as well as the goings-on in the political sphere. 

The soundtrack is very pleasant to listen to, but I'd have liked to see more variation in the tunes especially in Chapter 1. I do think it gets better as the game goes and as the stakes get higher. 

Gameplay is also great. A variety of classes and skill trees really let you build your party however you like. I was surprised to see that consumable items weren't in the game, but I appreciated the level of challenge that (and limited revives) brought to the battles. I played on the normal mode and found the difficulty very satisfying with some very intense fights. There is one gameplay bug I discovered, though; the sorcerer skill Blood Sacrifice claims to reduce the user's HP to 1, but that didn't ever happen when I used it, making it a quite OP skill.

This game has pretty mixed reviews but IMO it was a pretty solid experience and I'd recommend it to anyone who would enjoy playing a short tactical RPG. | A história é bem bacana, mas volta e meia o jogo dá umas travadas, sobretudo na missão de cortar as ervas. | Игра шла к релизу долгих семь лет, создавалась силами двух человек: брата и сестры...нет не из Алабамы, из Техаса) Судя по визуальному стилю вдохновлялись они Final Fantasy Tactics, к сожалению Arcadian Atlas в лучшем случае посредственная.

Сюжет:
История стартует с небольшого пролога и далее мы переносимся на некоторое время назад в королевство Данталион. После кровавых войн на континенте и установлении хрупкого мира в королевстве Данталион умирает король Тирган, его королева(вторая жена) узурпирует власть отстраняя его дочерей, но старшая дочь короля Лукреция не намерена так всё оставлять и поднимает восстание. В королевстве начинается гражданская война в гуще которой оказываются наши главные герои возлюбленные Вашти и Дезмонд генералы армии королевства Данталион. Если завязка сюжета ещё интересная, то повествование хромает на обе ноги, диалоги местами читаются натянуто и такое чувство что их писал первоклассник Вася на перемене, притянутая за уши любовная линия Анналис младшей дочери короля и бродяги Феника вообще ни в какие ворота. Страдает мотивация действующих лиц и ладно, могли бы какие-то решения отдать на откуп игроку, так и тот выбор что здесь есть вообще не влияет на развитие сюжета и концовку. Неужели сложно было сделать хотя бы две сюжетные развилки? Зачем-то сюжетно вообще ушли с политических интриг в сторону атласа аркадии(каких-то карт таро, дающих первозданную магическую силу) и толком ничего про них не объяснили, вот они есть у Феника и всё тут, додумывайте сами. 

Графика:
Визуальная составляющая это единственное что мне понравилось в этом произведении, в целом неплохо и узнается стиль. Но что меня больше всего впечатлило это анимация лиц пиксельных персонажей, они хмурятся\злятся\улыбаются\отводят взгляд в сторону, смотрится все это просто замечательно.

Звук / Саундтрек:
TJRPG вообще бедный на озвучку жанр, Disgaea не в счёт это вообще другая весовая категория) А вот саундтрек игры навеянный джазом вообще мимо для такой игры.

Геймплей:
Стандартная TJRPG, но какого хpенa здесь нет поворота камеры на 360? На полях есть изменения ландшафта, но они никак не влияют на сражение, даже разница высот или естественные укрытия ничего вам не дают, все миссии представлены убей всех/убей кого-то конкретного. Боевых классов 4 штуки: рыцарь, алхимик, стрелок, маг. Впоследствии с получением уровня каждый класс делится ещё на 2 по выбору игрока, но в этом нет смысла так как в игре абсолютно нет баланса, условный маг или алхимик с руки бьет не слабее рыцаря, стрелок так вообще имба при развитии ему берется разбойник ближнего боя, но каким-то неведомым образом он продолжает стрелять из кинжала? Ещё тут есть забавный баг руинищий игру, если вы примените способность\атаку на персонаже к которому её применить нельзя, то игра просто наглухо зависает, например: на мертвом персонаже примените хилку или попробуете атаковать труп. Тактической глубины здесь нет от слова совсем. А спецэффекты в сражениях хуже чем в Final Fantasy Tactics или Hoshigami играх конца 90х.

Итог:
Красивая обложка, интригующее начало и полный слив по всем направлениям. Даже рядом не стоит с Vanguard Bandits, Hoshigami, Final Fantasy Tactics и уж тем более Disgaea. Не стоит внимания даже по скидке, лучше дождаться выхода ремейка Front Mission 3.

They definitely tried. I would say they succeeded, but didn't really innovate on any mechanics to truly make it stand on its own. |  Final Fantasy tatics é uma parada q eu nunca joguei e ta travada em alguma coletânea de algum console aleatório (ou tu joga em emulador), mas o ponto é que eu não tenho como comparar nada, já que muita gente vem aqui ver se é talvez ""parecido"" com FFTatics.
  Pois bem, eu achei a experiencia nesse jogo muito boa, realmente queria saber o por que as pessoas gostavam tanto desse gênero, e me impressionei com a variedade de classe e ideias que se pode por em um personagem e nas composições, tem varias coisas secretas e um desafio bem equilibrado, eu só não platinei por ter muito grind e necessitar da DLC (Que eu não tenho).
 Concluindo, eu recomendo o jogo em alguma promoção (por que é meio salgado esse preço), já q ele tem uma historia bem interessante e personagens bem variados, alem de ser possível fazer uns combo bem cabuloso. | This is a good tactics game with some unique class leveling and combinations. | Slow, clunky, but a good Tactics RPG in general | This game really is a hidden gem. If you like strategy games, and particularly old school tactics like Final Fantasy Tactics and Vandal Hearts, I can highly recommend Fell Seal: Arbiter's Mark. While the first impact was not great, particularly in terms of graphics, the game grew on me quickly and within a few hours I knew I was dealing with a very solid title. 

The plot is alright, nothing spectacular but good enough for a game of this genre. Characters are overall likeable. Combat is well designed, maps are different and engaging. But where the game truly shines is the class system and the personalization available to the player. There's huge potential in finding combos, mixing abilities and really giving each unit a unique approach to combat. 

I'd give this game an overall 8 or even 8.5/10."

Le propriétaire n’étant pas disposé à le remettre à l’homme de main, tout part en vrille. Soudain, des démons surgissent de nulle part et mettent la ville sens dessus dessous. Et pour ne rien arranger, un esprit lié au katana, Hoji, apparaît à Lo Wang et lui explique à quel point les enjeux sont énormes.

Reboot d’un FPS fait par l’équipe de Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior se distingue des autres par plusieurs points :

D’abord, une ambiance très originale alliant haute technologie et folklore asiatique. Rapidement, Lo Wang devra affronter des démons issus du bestiaire légendaire chinois. Les décors sont aussi variés, on traverse de magnifiques jardins avec des cerisiers en fleurs, des cavernes, un port, et bien d’autres environnements.

Ensuite, la possibilité de commettre de véritables carnages à grands renforts d’armes mortelles, de katas au sabre, et de pouvoirs mystiques.

Enfin, une histoire plutôt honnête, et surtout de nombreuses pointes d’humour. Lo Wang affronte la mort avec désinvolture, et les vannes fusent entre lui et son comparse onirique.

Bref, un bon cocktail d’action débridée réservé aux joueurs les plus matures, long, plaisant, honnête. | 喜剧的背后往往都是悲剧 | Played this a lot on release on ps4 , after getting it again & starting a new run I dropped it & this is not a game that you can do that but this game stI’ll holds & runs well too this day."

队伍成了，本来还有预想着到后面换个队友试试的，因为洛思看起来身体里有什么邪恶的东西，而矮人我又实在不喜欢，唯有精灵或许我还挺喜欢，不过她似乎有着一系列的解决目标。可是随着冒险的的推进，我对队伍里的人逐渐积累了感情后又不舍得换了。印象最深刻的一次战斗是拿了传送手套后到处乱穿，想着从欢乐堡的港口绕过去，结果一进去一大片红点，而当时我还不怎么存档，回退的话与上一个档隔得相当远，当时我怀着绝望的心情带领小队迎战一群等级比我高的敌人，边打边往高地退，那时后队伍的主力是我和希贝尔，另外两位在我印象里都是相当的脆。于是我一个人在一边引开部分敌人边吸血边打，希贝尔在高地保护洛思，矮人作为男子汉也给我出来在与我相对的另外一边诱敌。最后发现其实我也没拖住什么敌人，大部分还是往着洛思那冲，然后被希贝尔一个盾牌一个盾牌解决，而比斯特则在对面后排跟法防弱的敌人巅峰对决，整场仗打下来发现竟然只有我的血条还蛮健康，甚至还有点物甲没破，原来队伍里只有我自己摸鱼摸得厉害（笑）。一场越级打怪，使我之后所有的战斗都变得轻松起来。希贝尔在盾牌战士这条路上越走越远，洛思逐渐成为雷电法王，只有比斯特和我两个人不知道在干什么，比斯特的问题是没输出的同时也脆脆的，而我属于是除了死不掉外就没什么优点了。一个队伍愣是让两个姑娘给撑起来了。
后来啊后来，我们走出了欢乐堡，穿越了浮木镇，探索了无名岛，闯荡了阿克城。希贝尔摧毁了母树，获得了真正的自由；洛思打败了医生，一首Sing for me；比斯特成了阿克斯城第一弓弩手（笑）；而我嘛，嘿嘿，希贝尔成了我的爱人，我还要忙着照顾队友呢，洛思还是不能让我放心，打败恶魔任重道远。
我存档体验了三个结局，神谕者结局，分享秘源结局，清除秘源结局。只能说无论如何，我还是更在乎我那几个故事永远在进行着的队友啊。估计很久我都不会再玩这个游戏了，结局要让它更像个伙伴再叙有望的结局，故事让它永远都是意犹未尽的故事。"

这个游戏构建的世界观比我看过的大部分神秘学小说都好，而上一个文本给我这么深刻印象的游戏是《极乐迪斯科》，优秀的世界观加上别具一格的文本给我一种看了一本很“新”的小说的感觉。
缺点也很值得一提，这个游戏的操作难度不高，却很难玩“会”。新玩家玩的时候难免一头雾水不知道干什么或是不知道如何面对挑战，如果不想在“解密”上花费过多时间可以考虑看一下灰机wiki。灰机wiki是很详尽的中文维基，不过这么看得多了恐怕会剥夺很多探索的乐趣，建议把握好度。

文本观赏性很强，非常洛式风味，好吃！ | Pros: 
Lots to explore, 12 hours in on first playthrough i probably touched the surface
Interesting worldbuilding and cool systems
Can be very addictive once you've gotten used to the system

Cons: 
- Many tasks feel like grinding. A lot of repetitiveness, be it work, reading books or studying skills. E.g. to improve your [spoiler]  ""reason"" [/spoiler] skill you have to  combine 8 [spoiler] ""Erudition"" [/spoiler]  which takes 60 seconds each to combine, and 60 seconds to make, all on timers before they run out... 

- The way cards get added to your field sucks ass and is beyond annoying, just dumping them wherever with no possibility to have a dedicated place for a certain type of card. Let me have all books in one place, all vitality in another etc... being unable to stack cards with different timers is also extremly annoying and creates a mess all the time. 

Overall, a 6/10 which would be probably a 7 or 8 if the quality of life wasn't so miserable at points. 

If you like management in games | This game is a passionate love affair I keep coming back to.  It's not something I recommend to everyone (honestly I don't think any game is, but this one is more ""has a highly specific target audience"" than most) - you have to be some combination of a fiddly detail obsessive, wiki-diver, and opaque lore-enjoyer to really get the most out of it.  

Watching the previews will give a decent sense of the actual gameplay, which I would have difficulty describing, but the *feeling* of playing the game can't really be communicated as easily, I think.  Cultist Sim is incredibly atmospheric, and a lot better at creating interesting tension than a few gameplay clips can really convey.  The timer progression is such an integral part of not just the mechanics, but the mood.  Is your current Dream action (20 seconds remaining) going to turn up the card you need to dispel part of the Fascination counter (45 seconds remaining) currently spelling your doom?  etc.  

Also, it pays to actually read the descriptive text on things - it will all sound like pretentious bullshit at first, but there is a kind of shockingly cohesive, deep, and interesting setting and story going on, here, behind all the timer-watching.

My one main criticism is that it is really, really bad at teaching you how to play it.  I'd recommend spending a few minutes on youtube to help get the basics down; there are a lot of aspects of the game that are satisfying to find out in an exploratory manner, but the basics of stuff like, how to recruit and promote Followers are not that.  Thankfully, the fan wiki is also excellent, and basically an essential resource if you get in deep. | 简单来说这个游戏就是一个有很多个倒计时的卡牌收集经营游戏，倒计时结束没有获得对应的卡牌丢进去那游戏也就结束了。规则比较复杂，没有新手指引，没有故事背景，全部的新手指引和故事背景全靠wiki和网上各位大佬总结的攻略，对新手极其不友好，在游戏当中选中卡片可以看到部分的提示或者片面的故事背景，如果不是对密教这类黑暗题材感兴趣的不建议游玩。

       不过如果是喜欢这类游戏的，这个游戏确实很上头，在这个游戏里面可以体验一下当教主的快乐，体验一下探索各种藏宝地以及收集各种宝物，手下，书籍的乐趣，另外可以通过书籍中的只言片语了解一下这个庞大而又神秘的世界。

       接下来说说我目前发现的缺点：1、没有指引，2、比较多bug，好几次遇到莫名其妙的bug直接挂掉或者门徒受伤，建议手动存档或者ctrl + ~，后面的缺点涉及剧透，请谨慎观看，
[spoiler]  3、这个世界是一个普通人-通晓者-长生者-具名者-司辰这样的路线，一周目飞升就是长生者飞升，长生者是好歹还是相对自由一点的，但是我个人很不喜欢二周目使徒晋升具名者这样的设定，为什么不能取而代之成为司辰，非要是给司辰当狗，大哥，我是密教头子欸，是我的教会又不是司辰的教会，为啥非得只有这样的结局，这个让人很不爽的。4、作为密教头子，我能理解我不能事必躬亲，但是我好歹是一个有超凡能力的强者，除了让手下和召唤物干活，我就只能打工和看书，能不能不要这么废，尤其是二周目，我一周目都解锁过的东西又要我解锁一边，而且我好歹一个飞升过的强者，还要从头打工能不能不要这么low。 [/spoiler]"

They don't sell you complete games, they sell you some of a game then sell you many of the cool features that synergize with your favorite factions separately through DLC... if your favorite faction isn't a DLC in itself that is. Factions like Wood Elves are locked away behind over priced DLC you can only buy from TWW1 and there's now 3 TWW games, and many, many DLCs with bonus lords, heroes and entire factions locked away within them.

I'm playing a Dark Elf campaign and its a lot of fun to be honest. Being a dick head slaver is cool... what's not cool? Some of my best lords and heroes are locked away behind 2 different DLCs. The 'Master' hero who kicks butt and takes slaves, and the 'Supreme Sorcerer' lord, so you can have a powerful spellcaster instead of a typical warrior/captain Dreadlord. One of these DLCs are 18.99... the other is around 7 dollars. That's for ONE faction's complete roster and mechanics. If you want to play with multiple factions in their entirety through the 3 games? God help you, you poor financially milked bastard. | 锤完了，根本停不下来，已经锤到天昏地暗了，根本锤不完啊，这根本就锤不完？？！。‘；’ | Designed to be as unfun as possible and it doesn't even work anymore | Love this game, it's exactly the kind of turn-based strategy I like. Amazing fantasy setting. Great lore too. A must play! | You like or hate it, game feels extremely overwhelming from beginning to late stage, but personally battles are biggest problem, limited to 2 stances with 20 different parts of army to somehow manage, if AI would have at least 1% of own thinking except running away and not break groups doing absolute mess blending in trees it would be totally different. Game is not bad but gameplay just depends purely on person its not real time strategy like any other, its just own kind"
76561197999482693,760060,Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden,3.75,"RPG, Strategy",5,"Great game!!! XCOM is my all time favorite and when I saw it was comparable, took the plunge and have not been disappointed.  I own the RPG and the miniatures game as well.  LOVE the genre, story and characters with all the personality you could ask for!!! | I enjoyed this game very much. Some what linear in its story but the story and tactical fights is what makes it good. Style is similar to the newer XCOM games (not the one from the 90s) and is not as complex as the Jagged Alliance series. 

Although simple, it does get a bit hard for only 3 characters at a time. Gear is expensive and you dont ever heal by resting. (you actually have to use medkits) The special skillsets is where one applies strategy for the tactical fights.

Its a good game and found myself coming back from work ready to play each night. But its not that easy. | В первый раз когда играл показалось сложной, но это видимо я был не в настроении. Игра отличная, даже не знаю что еще можно порекомендовать фанатам XCOM. | 游戏的剧情发展不错  命中比例算是比较正确  就是跑图太耽误时间了 | 玩了续作之后 回来补票的，和一般的战旗不同，先潜行干掉80%的落单和小团体敌人，最后再面对BOSS。总体来说还是值得一玩的"
76561197999482693,763890,Wildermyth,5.8,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",5,"A good and long rpg that will keep you busy for quite a while.
It's interesting to see how the character you create will grow their own personality and relationships with the other characters.
A little downside, some of the dialogues feel weird or make no sense at times. | Wildermyth is a simply amazing game. The gameplay is fun and really easy to pick up, allowing you a much lighter & quicker character building experience without needing the deep time sink that many games do (though I also enjoy that). The procedural story generation system can occasionally lead to some oddities but all in all makes for a very fun and replayable experience! 

I also love the concept of adventures spanning multiple generations, and characters becoming too old to fight. it adds an element of scale and realism to the adventures that I really appreciate. A great game for Strategy & RPG Newcomers or vets looking for a deep and replayable experience! | I love this game.

Don't let the art style keep you from trying it. It took me a while to warm up to it, but i think it actually suits the game very well.

The writing style also has it's own rhythm, and it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but it creates an unique atmosphere for the game. It can get poetic and it can definitely require your full attention. You need to be prepared to read, if you want to enjoy this game to the fullest. | 玩法剧情随机性各方面发展非常均衡的游戏。一开始入坑是被剧情和随机性吸引，但是几个剧情战役的主线剧情也写的很好，把剧情都大概过一遍后又开始对战旗玩法上头，基本上每一局都能发现一种新的好用的搭配，而且英雄间的技能搭配也非常有开发空间，再加上变身和职业技能的搭配 ...可玩性非常高！而且很多看上去一般的技能搭配其它技能后会变得异常好用，总体来说三种职业确实各有优缺点，没有明显的优劣之分，均衡性不错。难度可选，默认难度对入门玩家已很友好。综合来讲十分推荐！ | o combate tático é simples, mas bom. Porém, os pontos altos do jogo estão fora do combate. As estórias de cada campanha; a forma com que a narrativa é conduzida; a criação de personagens como eles evoluem, interagem com os outros e ganham suas próprias estórias. Todos esses elementos se juntam pra produzir uma experiência que jamais tive em qualquer outro jogo de RPG. É simplesmente lindo!"
76561197999482693,310950,Street Fighter V,0.6,Action,1,"El juego esta muy bien, pero a menos que te sobre el dinero para comprar todos los DLC, la mejor versión es la de ""elamigos"" | better than sf6 currently sf6 added to many new chars and not enough of the og cast. no sakura, nash, kage, or G so ill stick to sf5 | Solid entry in the SF series, now that it's had some time to mature. Big roster, great combos and fight mechanics, and fairly decent online play with a good internet connection. Single player arcade mode is great, and I like that you can choose to play character story lines of previous versions of characters SF. The general story of SF V and it's cut scenes are however... pretty juvenile and ridiculous and left a lot to be desired. Overall I'm happy with it and would recommend if you enjoy 2.5D fighting games. | bom jogo a franquia street fighter e muito massa recomendo todos os jogos da pra se divertir amssando os amigos nesse e nos outros jogos da franquia recomendo n joguei o competitivo nesse ainda mais eu acho q vai ser legal | its very fun, and different enough from 6 to justify playing by itself"
76561197999482693,560130,Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire,0.0,RPG,0,"Fantastic game. good characters good graphics and alot of character options to roleplay. I would reccomend to not do all of the sidequests in one playthrough because it will take ALOT of time to do them all so i would say to split them if youre planning on doing multiple playthroughs.

Also play the first game before this one, it will bring over some characters and decisions so the world feels more full. | Big improvement over the First game, combat feels great, you didn't get overwhelm with all sort of Lore at the beginning like the First, and pirates... bloody pirates! The story had comical pacing where you don't really know what you're doing and once you got that figured out you're about 2 quests from ending. It does have a thoughtful ending similar to the first, but if you didn't play the First then the Second won't have a similar punch, | Good CRPG. Alot of things done right. Recommend for any crpg enjoyer

The two things hurting it the most are 1. bonus solo xp and 2. salvation of time. The armor system isn't great either but its shortfalls are mitigated somewhat by the inversions in damage calculation. The categorical penetration could've easily been made more granular beyond under/over/penetrating, but it's not a big deal compared to the first two things. 

Those first two things break power progression and destroy tactics completely, i mean wtf you can reach max level 25% into the game and one priest spell is the cornerstone of an apex 'strategy' (if you can even it strategy) making you invincible. The upside is these two things aren't baked in. You can simply avoid using (abusing) them.

it's still definitely worth playing though, both deadfire and the first pillars game | Игра только для ценителей жанра. Обязательно играть во вторую только после прохождения первой иначе лор игры будет не понятен. Не много душнит в 3 акте но не значительно.  Так в целом игра очень интересная, красивая, с отлично проработанным миром. Советую с осторожностью.  Только для ценителей жанра. | Really good isometric cRPG. 80h in and probably halfway done with a playthrough (playing in turn-based combat). Plenty of content to be had. Everything voice acted, great morality and relationship system, great story and good combat (which could be better in terms of user interface and some balancing between skills, but otherwise it's great). Only cons like many others have pointed out is the ship to ship combat, which could've been so much more than a text based interaction that it is currently. 

Overall, highly recommended!"
76561197999482693,209670,Cortex Command,0.0,"Action, Indie, Strategy",0,"A great game left out in the rain by the developers. You can get the whole game for free and open source since the original creators did put out the code themself. I was really debating on if giving this a positive or negative rating was better, in the end is up to you how you spend money. The workshop is great so I would understand if that was a deciding factor. Personally I have no gripes with the game, only annoying thing they put in it was adverts for Planetoid Pioneers inside it. Planetoid Pioneers being the game that killed people's respect of the developers as it was shortly abandoned too.

Another reason I found it hard to review Cortex Command is trying to fit the gameplay in to a single genre. This has RTS aspects with the economy and battles, but it is also a very chill base builder. It has its economic managment phase, but also the abilily to gather and store wealth during battles for later use. If I was really forced to I would call it something it would be a 2D RTS with a strategy campaing in order to show the results of what you and the AI has made of the planet during corporate warfare. You really need to see it in order to get it.

Any negative review either mentions one of two things. One Data Realms behavior of abounding games and still selling a inferior bug ridden mess (I mean why buy this instead of downloading it for free?). Two the jank of this title. What makes Cortex Command so great is the engine, the terrain and units and vehicles all can be destroyed pixel by pixel. This can ofcourse lead to problems, you could get stuck on your own dead units or a mere pixel in the way. You could be thrown half across the battle field. You could even just die from something you didn't see. Yes there are a lot of crashes. I also  feel the only challange comes from the AI's ability to spam units and have them act on their own, out matches the player's ability to multitask and the rather piss poor auto commands you can give. For one player climbing is a pinch, for another is a unresolvable problem in the code.

The positive aspects is that the code is out there, and I have never seen as impressive mods as I have with this title. You can play with units and vechiles at such a size it boggles the mind. Nothing will preaper you from the joy of seeing all your carnage, wreckages, old fortifcations and corpses remaning battle from battle. I can't count how many times I even destroyed my own units to add flavor to the terrain is just that cool looking (the Star Destroyer being my personal favorite sprite). Some mods just makes this a whole different game, Void Wanderers is so good it could be sold on its own. Is also very natural how you control units and build, I had no problem learning to play on my own and unlike others never experinced any real issues with climbing ladders or interacting with items. No other games really gives me the feel anything I want is possible. | У меня с другом было наиграно сотни часов после учебы ))) С модами было очень весело играть. Сейчас уже все мертво и никому не нужно | 飞船可以回收地上的武器和流血不止的伤员
没加mod我竟然能玩百来个小时 | Удивительная Игра. Просто ИЗУМИТЕЛЬНО!

Одна из не многих игр с симуляцией физики такого уровня и уж тем более такого типа. А конкретнее симуляцией каждого пикселя. Мне безумно понравился Сетинг, Карты, Оружие, Ванильные Фракции. Но к сожалению, игра давно была заброшена Разработчиками в якобы ""релизе"", а наследник оказался мягко говоря паршивым. Потому я всё же перешёл на ОпенСурс версию с до работанным движком, механиками и балансом. Спасибо Комьюнити за то, что всё ещё поддерживаете игру!

Like the Ship of Theseus, nearly every part has been replaced, usually for the better but sometimes replaced with inferior versions. The voice acting especially, stood out as a major letdown compared to the original. There's mods to bring back some of it, but it makes me sad that most people won't be installing them and thus won't grow to appreciate the original artistry as I did.

Like imagine someone painted an ""improved"" version of the Mona Lisa. That's great, they could make it appeal to a more modern audience and add their own spin to make it unique, but it's not a replacement for the original. It's not a replacement for the original. 

I can't help but feel like the heart of the game has been altered or diminished. Like it's hard to call it the same game as the one I grew up with and played so much.

Positives
+ Gameplay is still very much the same as the original - there are no major overhauls of the core mechanics which made previous renditions great
+ Improved resource UI which makes villager management much easier during the crucial first minutes of the game
+ The ability to queue both units and technologies simultaneously
+ The ability to indefinitely re-seed farms and fish traps if you have the available resources
+ Several new units and technologies (such as the Steppe Lancer and Supplies) to balance existing civilisations and provide new ways to play
+ Multiple new single-player / multi-player lobby options, such as game speed, map pool, AI difficulty and type (such as the 'new' AI for Definitive Edition, or the HD and CD AI)
+ You can use the lobby browser for multi-player while waiting in a lobby
+ Your multi-player game stats are tracked, and you can earn player profile pictures from time played, number of victories etc.
+ Improved visual effects (such as collapsing structures, improved unit models and environmental / lighting effects)
+ Improved sound effects, whilst remaining true to the charm of classic Age of Empires II (units have their original voice lines and so on)
+ Massive update to AI commanding in single player games - you can now use the taunt/command system to tell your AI allies to train specific types of units, construct buildings on a flare marker, attack a specific target and so on
+ Several new civilisations with their own unique units
+ Several new historical campaigns
+ Massive improvement to the tutorial system, with new scenarios (Art of War) specifically catered to helping new players deal with managing economies, performing and defending from rushing, etc.
+ Tweaks to the scenario editor (such as copy-pasting event triggers)
+ In-house mod support (Steam workshop has been removed in favour, could be interpreted as a negative)
+ Xbox LIVE profile support and cross-play
+ A ton of different settings to customise your gameplay experience by tweaking controls, graphics, sound and so on (several of these settings also make the game more accessible for individuals experiencing difficulty from handicaps such as colour blindness etc.)
+ Dedicated servers, and private multi-player games appear to run much smoother than HD
+ Steam achievements and trading cards
+ Improved replays and save systems (you can save 'chapters' in a replay for players to watch specific events)

Сюжет клішований - якщо є Древньо-Єгипетська тема, то має бути якесь повстале страшко/божок, яке планує знищити світ і оживляє навколо себе різну нечисть. Браві герої, які не дуже ясно звідки взялися і як об'єдналися виступають проти цього зла, паралельно розгадуючи приховані секрети локацій і грабуючи гробниці. Можливо для більш глибокого розуміння подій треба було трохи почитати місцеві колекційні журнали і ввімкнути субтитри до діалогів, але я вирішив забити, адже гра явно не про неймовірний сюжет.

Геймплейно це шутер від третьої особи. На кількох відносно лінійних картах досліджуємо локації, потряплятимемо на закриті арени, де відбиватимемо кілька хвиль ворогів, далі знов перепочинок, а потім знову арена. В кінці більшості карт ще можуть трапитися не дуже складні боси. Вороги знову ж типові для жанру: скелети, мумії чи мінотаври, а статуї богів, що ожили типу Гора або Анубіса виступають в ролі тих самих босів. Деякі екземпляри звичайних ворогів представляють гравцю один в один як з ""Мумії"", від чого я відчув присмак ностальгії за тими часами, коли вперше з захватом дивився стрічку чи її сиквел.

Розробники з Rebellion шутерну механіку залишили такою ж, яка є в їхньому флагмані - Sniper Elite, лише вирізавши все, що пов'язане саме зі снайперками типу рентгенівських пострілів, стелсу і тд. Тут в основному автомати та гвинтівки і відкритий бій з десятками ворогів. Стрільба не топ, але терпима, якийсь імпакт від зброї відчувається. Всього є +-10 видів основної зброї і кілька пістолетів, які використовувати майже немає сенсу через малий дамаг, лише якщо набої в основі закінчилися.

Інша сторона геймплею - пошуки скарбів. На кожній мапі є багацько місць з скринями, у них трапляється золото (за яке можна купляти нове озброєння) або апгрейди для зброї (типу хіл за вбивство, більше шкоди від хедшотів і тд). Окремо варто згадати щось на кшталт гробниць. Кожна знаходиться за дверима, які відкриваються лише з рішенням загадки на них. Десь потрібно знайти відповідну послідовність зображень, в іншій - скласти шлях ""змійці"" від старту до фінішу тощо. На початку цікаво, але в якийсь момент загадки починають повторюватися і єдине, що залишає інтерес - пошук розгадки в новому місці. Прикро, адже для менш як десятка місій можна було вигадати різні унікальні головоломки.

Також варто згадати режим орди, де на кількох аренах нам дають виживати під атаками хвиль ворогів. Там потрібно заробляти золото, щоб купляти нову зброю та відкривати різні двері з апгрейдами. Один раз зіграти - може бути, але дуже швидко набридає, особливо враховуючи, що нічого супер нового і відмінного від основної гри тут немає. Те ж саме і в режимі гри на бали. Карти інші, але геймплей той самий і без суттєвих нагород, хіба потрапити в таблицю лідерів, щоб серед друзів там світитися.

Якихось технічних проблем я взагалі не помітив, лише біда з високим пінгом критично відображаються на геймплеї на високій складності - фізично неможливо уникнути пошкоджень, адже вороги завдають ударів, яких на екрані клієнта ще не відбулося, а шкоду він отримав. На насичених ворогами і мінібосами-мінотаврами аренах це було вкрай неприємно і смертельно. Тож в кооперативі рекомендую грати з ""сусідами""))

Сказати, що Strange Brigade чудова й неймовірна язик не повертається. Це досить проста гра без якихось неймовірних геймплейних можливостей чи ВАУ ефектів. Просто хороша забавка, щоб зануритися черговий раз в єгипетську тематику та повалити мертвяків в один з вечорів після роботи, бажано - в компанії з товаришем/ами, так буде веселіше. На розпродажі її повна версія зі всіма DLC вартує всього 92 гривні  і особисто мені було не шкода потрачених на неї коштів та часу. | Gameplay is basically a mix of horde and puzzle solving.

You could beat the game 60 times and still not unlock everything, but most of the unlocks later on are just combos so they don't add variety or mix up how you play. because the lack of enemy variety between runs, and no randomness to mix up waves, the game play loops is terrible. 

- the grind required to unlock everything should be way less.
- the exp you get each run is achingly low even with modifiers.

76561197999482693,741820,Prey: Typhon Hunter,0.0,Action,0,"Prey: Typhon Hunter : By Triple F

""Prey: Typhon Hunter"" is an ambitious multiplayer expansion to Prey (2017), developed by Arkane Studios and published by Bethesda. Released in December 2018 as part of the Mooncrash DLC, it takes the immersive sim mechanics of the base game and transforms them into an asymmetrical multiplayer experience. At its core, ""Typhon Hunter"" is a game of cat and mouse, where one player takes on the role of Morgan Yu, the protagonist from Prey, while up to five others control shapeshifting alien Mimics. The concept is intriguing, drawing clear inspiration from games like Prop Hunt, but with Prey’s signature sci-fi horror elements woven in. Unfortunately, while the idea is strong, execution issues and a lack of long-term support prevented it from reaching its full potential.

The gameplay is simple but tense. The Morgan player must hunt down all Mimics within a time limit, while the Mimic players disguise themselves as everyday objects scattered throughout the environment. The catch is that the Mimics can move, attack, and switch disguises at will, leading to unpredictable and often hilarious encounters. This creates an atmosphere of paranoia for Morgan, as every chair, cup, or trash can could be an enemy waiting to pounce. The Mimics, on the other hand, must balance deception with aggression, knowing that staying hidden for too long can make them easy targets. This dynamic makes for thrilling matches, especially when both sides are evenly skilled. However, over time, the novelty begins to wear off due to limited maps, repetitive strategies, and a lack of meaningful progression systems.

One of ""Typhon Hunter’s"" strongest aspects is its adherence to Prey’s immersive and atmospheric design. The environments pulled from the main game are richly detailed, and the sound design plays a crucial role in heightening tension. Morgan's footsteps echo ominously in empty hallways, while Mimics scurry and chitter as they reposition. The visual cues and environmental storytelling, hallmarks of Prey’s level design, add depth to the experience, making every match feel like a mini horror story. However, the mode struggles with balance; skilled Morgan players can often make quick work of the Mimics, while coordinated Mimics can sometimes overwhelm Morgan too easily. These imbalances, combined with a relatively small player base, made finding consistently engaging matches difficult.

In addition to the multiplayer mode, ""Typhon Hunter"" also includes an experimental VR escape room experience called TranStar VR. This mode offers a handful of single-player puzzle-based challenges set within Prey’s universe. While a neat concept, TranStar VR feels more like a tech demo than a fully fleshed-out experience. The puzzles are decent, but the movement and interaction mechanics can feel clunky, especially compared to other VR puzzle games. It’s an interesting addition but not compelling enough to justify a purchase on its own.

The biggest issue with ""Typhon Hunter"" is its longevity or lack thereof. Unlike other successful asymmetrical multiplayer games, such as Dead by Daylight or Among Us, it lacks the content updates, unlockable rewards, or deep customization options that keep players engaged over the long term. With only a handful of maps and no significant updates after launch, the player base dwindled quickly. By mid-2019, finding a match without coordinating with friends became increasingly difficult. This lack of long-term support significantly hurt what could have been a thriving multiplayer experience.

Despite its flaws, ""Prey: Typhon Hunter"" is an interesting experiment that offers some genuinely fun and tense moments, especially for fans of Prey’s world and lore. The core gameplay mechanics work well, and the blend of horror and deception makes for a uniquely stressful multiplayer experience. However, its lack of content, balance issues, and dwindling player base prevented it from ever truly standing out in the competitive multiplayer scene.

Ultimately, ""Typhon Hunter"" is best seen as a novelty rather than a must-play multiplayer game. If you’re a die-hard Prey fan or enjoy asymmetrical multiplayer games, it’s worth trying, just don’t expect a game with lasting appeal. While it had the potential to be a cult hit, the lack of post-launch support meant it faded into obscurity all too quickly."
76561197999482693,867210,Songs of Conquest,1.2666666666666666,"Adventure, RPG, Strategy",0,"Just feels like a straight downgrade from games from 20 years ago but I have a problem putting my finger on why exactly.  Maybe it's the graphics that feel too blocky. Maybe it's the overabundance of crappy hero equipment that devalues the joy of getting a stat improvement.  Maybe it's needing to invest level upgrades into just having more troops.  Maybe it's the arbitrary caps on how many troops can be in a stack.  Maybe it's the magic system with ""mana"" that is too bifurcated, obtuse and weak feeling.

Ця гра поєднує в собі загадковий сюжет, химерний світ і захоплюючий ігровий процес, створюючи щось абсолютно неповторне. 

[h3] Сюжет і атмосфера [/h3]
Події гри розгортаються у Федеральному бюро контролю (FBC) — таємничій урядовій організації, яка займається паранормальними явищами. Гравець бере на себе роль Джессі Фейден, яка шукає свого зниклого брата. Вона опиняється в штаб-квартирі бюро, відомій як Найстаріший Будинок — будівлі, що змінює форму і не підкоряється законам фізики.

Джессі несподівано отримує посаду директора бюро й виявляє, що місце заражене паранормальним феноменом, відомим як ""Шепіт"" (The Hiss). Гра майстерно розкриває сюжет через документи, записи, загадкові діалоги та дослідження світу, занурюючи в атмосферу науково-фантастичного хорору. Remedy створила світ, який водночас лякає і зачаровує. 

[h3] Геймплей [/h3]
Головна особливість Control — це неймовірно динамічний ігровий процес. Джессі володіє пістолетом-перетворювачем, який змінює форму й функції, але головна родзинка гри — це її паранормальні здібності. Гравець може використовувати телекінез, кидати предмети у ворогів, створювати щити з уламків і навіть левітувати.

Бойова система чудово реалізована: кожна сутичка відчувається як динамічний танець, де потрібно швидко ухилятися, атакувати й використовувати оточення для переваги. Противники, заражені ""Шепотом"", відрізняються як візуально, так і за поведінкою, що робить бої цікавими.

Окремо варто відзначити дизайн рівнів. Найстаріший Будинок — це величезна метафізична структура, де кожна кімната виглядає унікально. Гравець відкриває нові області, отримуючи здібності й ключі доступу, що робить гру схожою на метроїдванію.

[h3] Візуал і звук [/h3]
Control — це технічний і художній шедевр. Гра використовує рушій Northlight і підтримує технології на кшталт трасування променів (Ray Tracing), що додає реалістичності відображенням і світлу. Кожна деталь візуально пропрацьована: від розлітаючихся уламків до сюрреалістичних змін середовища.

Звуковий дизайн заслуговує окремої похвали. Напружена музика і незвичайні аудіоефекти підсилюють відчуття тривоги, а голоси ""Шепоту"", які іноді чутно під час гри, додають напруженості.

[h3] Недоліки [/h3]
Control не позбавлена недоліків. Деякі гравці можуть вважати, що сюжет залишає забагато питань без відповідей, а для тих, хто не любить шукати записки й документи, може здатися, що історія занадто розпорошена.

[h3] 100% досягнень [/h3]
Тут можна сказати небагато для любителів проходити ігри на 100%, то всі досягнення можно отримати за одне проходження, складності в них немає.

[h3] Висновок [/h3]
Control — це сміливий експеримент, який поєднує стильний дизайн, незабутню атмосферу та інноваційний геймплей. Гра вимагає від гравця уваги до деталей і готовності зануритися в загадковий світ. Хоча вона може здатися трохи важкою для тих, хто любить прямолінійний сюжет, для фанатів інтригуючих історій і паранормальних загадок це справжній подарунок.

I have not played the original first game yet so that is why I think it is not as horrible as the reviews make it out to be but there are definitely some weak points. Here are my points below in no particular order.

What I liked: 

- difficulty without all the aim assist was decent enough when it comes to pure 1v1 dogfights
- unique visual style
- amazing soundtrack
- cool main character
- runs well
- nice mini games in the bar, I spent quite a few hours with just playing pool and dice poker
- flipping off enemies and trash talking through comms
- you can have your own station
- companions

What I disliked:

- the star systems are too big to the point they do not make sense, you can skip travel but even with that I felt it was tedious to go through several systems
- barely anything to do, missions seem varied at first but there are a lot of repeat offenders with barely anything different yet being labelled as something else
- nothing visually unique about the star systems, like if you played Freelancer and saw a mostly red background you knew you were in Bretoina, there is none of that here, the last system you go to is exactly like the first one you start in
- your own station is heavily underutilized, the game does not really go out of its way to tell you this is even a thing
- enemies sort of scale with you defeating the sense of progression, I was able to farm credits for end game gear in the starting system and meet end game enemies
-companions have some side missions but there is not much point and most of them are useless if you call them to help you
- main story felt like it just ended randomly without properly resolving the root of the conflict
- absolutely abysmal way for missions to trigger into their next phase, I could do 10 system jumps without triggering anything, sometimes I got it after just going near a station
- the fastest ships are exclusive to the enemies

I did not even notice I wrote a wall of text, oh well, it is ok to play through once, it is really sad that the developer was literally bullied out of game making. | Great Game, Almost as good as the first Game Rebel Galaxy (witch i still play), But I do miss being able to hire a

The writing is nice and gives you decent glimpse into the Mechanicus and some factions within them. The gameplay is solid, it feels less like a strategy game and more like a puzzle to be solved which is pretty fun.

However there are issues, on the intended difficulty the game is very easy. Your Tech Priests quickly become self healing gods that destroy everything. In my entire playthrough of the game I didnt't have a single Tech Priest die, only expendable troops.

Also because it is so easy it feels like theres no reason to ""explore"" the extra rooms in missions. I just beeline to the objective everytime. 

I hope that the second game addresses some of this because it was really fun but it could be better. I'd recommend it on sale. | Очень бюджетная и затянутая аркада.

Первые часов пять играть довольно интересно, приходится действительно над тактикой думать, выбирать кто пойдет на миссию. Но когда открывается минимальный необходимый гир, что происходит часу на 7, кривая сложности резко падает на дно и дальше ты просто катишься катком всё больше разгоняясь. Некроны вообще ничего не могут противопоставить пачке хотя бы из четырех жрецов и случайные ивенты наносят урона больше, чем все стычки с некронами за миссию в совокупности.

Случайные ивенты вообще мем в этой игре, зачастую даже выбора, который бы приводил к нейтральному или положительному исходу в комнатах нет, то есть это просто обвешивание вашей группы дебафами, чтобы вам было хоть немножко посложнее в финальном файте миссии.

Но главная проблема этой игры это тексты, в игре примерно 45 миссий, после и перед каждой из них вас обдают тугой струёй диалогов по типу
Магос Пупа: Нам нужно захватить эту жижу из гробницы ксеносов, магос 
Магос Лупа: Да, магос, мы обязаны изучить её!
Магос Запупа: НЕТ! Это грязные технологии, мы должны их сжечь!
Магос Лупа: Да, магос, все ксеносы умрут, магос!
Магос Пупа: Но писание учит, что всякое знание благо! Значит мы должны всё захватывать и изучать!
Магос Лупа: Да, магос, поиск знаний бесконечный процесс, мы захватим жижу!
Магос Запупа: Я протестую! „рандомная цитата“ Значит мы обязаны уничтожить жижу!
Магос Лупа: Да, магос, вы совершенно правы, магос!

И эта ахинея КАЖДЫЙ раз после и до миссий, по 10-15 реплик. При этом суть почти всех этих диалогов БУКВАЛЬНО как я описал, с поправкой на то, какой магос начинает ныть, про несчастных скитариев ли или про недостаточность снабжения. Сюжета же или лора там 0000,1%, поэтому во второй половине игры уже начинаешь просто скипать весь этот шум.

Вторая половина игры игра вообще жесточайше душит – некроны перестают давать хоть какой-то отпор, карты начинают повторяться, а видов миссий тут вообще только три на всю игру. Лишь сражения с боссами немного радуют и, как слабый свежий ветерок, выручают. Но боссов мало, игра идёт часов 30, а контента в ней часов на 8. | Fantastic visuals

EDIT: If mods were still supported, I would pay full price for this. As it stands, don't bother without a sale.

EDIT EDIT: A lot of the most popular mods on the workshop seem to work just fine. So, I may have been hasty in my original post | An inferior Total War: Shogun with blobby combat and unresponsive units - Which is par for the course for modern total war.

Something strange happened to the Total War franchise after the engine change i  Total War Rome 2. Suddenly every combat encounter is a bunch of segmented blobs with no coherency. Nothing is different in Total War Three Kingdoms. This means you can pretty much  segment Total War into the good games before the engine change and the bad ones after.

The unit and faction variety is about the same as in Total War Shogun, with the addition of 'Hero Characters' like in Total War Warhammer. These hero characters are overpowered and add to the problem of just blobbing everything together. 

Supposedly this game has the best diplomacy of any Total War and with a proper 'End Game'. This seems to be a lie. The end game is the same as every other Total War in that a 'Realm Divide' happens which makes every faction hate you.

If you're someone who likes modern Total War this game is more of the same but now with chinese people.

1. Full of bugs. Example you can stuck anywhere at all and can't move and last save is like an hour ago and you have completed a lot only to redo all again.
2. The save system is ridiculous. You can go for hours without triggering a save or even after completing a main quest. Probably another bugs.
3. No such thing as stealth if you're looking for one. Once you snipe for example, another isolated and far far away sniper, you will trigger and agroed whole enemies in the area, and they know where you are. No point in going stealth. 
4. Enemies can suddenly appear outta nowhere and they can see you from crazy distance.
I didn't get much fun with this one as I got from SGW2. None of these problems I encountered with the second one. Save your money and time and just play that one instead. | i feel that this is an adult game you have to think more about what you going to do and once you play the game you just dont stop there, every time I play it I play it differently I take different paths, I do the challengens that I wasnt able to do on a previous game.

Im waiting for the next game . that is after SGWC2. will they be another? | If you're looking for a sniper game then this is it. It is extremely enjoyable to stealthily eliminate enemy combatants either from mid-long range with your trusty sniper or up close with your sidearm or blade. The regions are cool and you can tell effort was made here to make them feel real. Most areas offer multiple ways around the enemy. 

That was the good, now the bad:

The enemy here are ok. The A.I can get stuck on occasion but the most frustrating part in this game is that they speak english. I don't understnad why make the enemy Siberians and then make them speak the worst Russian accent english I've ever heard. This is mind boggling to me. Nothing will ever break my immersion more than that.

Each mission has its own challenges. Some are fun to tackle, some make you use different tactics but others are just not worth the trouble and make the game not fun. Some challenges require you to break stealth and turning the place into a shooting gallery is just not enjoyable. The A.I is not the greatest for combat and it shows. Gun variety is ok but because you'll likely always want EMP bullets to deal with cameras or sentry turrets you'll only use 1 gun and ignore all the others. There's also a few .50 cal snipers that are obviously unsuppressed and I don't understand why they exist in a game Sniper GHOST WARRIOR. The moment you fire your first shot you're spotted. There's also a small variety of secondary weapons, ARs and Shotguns. You can't suppress any of them and I barely ever use them, I would rather not have one and instead have more sniper or pistol ammo.

I find that a lot of my complaints are very obvious to any casual sniper player. If they had made a Beta of this game they would have likely caught all this and fixed/adjusted things accordingly.

The 2nd game isn't all that better, especially not in the realism and there are many recycled assets to the point that the entire game should be DLC. Compared to what earlier games did this is a major disapointment. | Sniper: Ghost Warrior Contracts è un'esperienza di tiro tattico che combina l'abilità di mira precisa con l'elemento stealth. Il gioco ti pone nei panni di un cecchino mercenario che deve completare contratti uccidendo bersagli specifici.

По геймплею напоминает GR Wildlands, но на небольших полуоткрытых локациях.
Что понравилось: снайперская стрельба, разнообразие гаджетов, внешний вид карт и геймплей на полуоткрытых пространствах вроде вражеских баз.
Что не понравилось: разброс пистолета и автомата, система сохранений чекпоинтами, и плохо задизайненные кишкообразные участки карт, которые лучше проходить с боем, потому что иначе задушитесь проходить по стелсу (особенно финальная карта этим грешит)."

The game throws endless waves of stick-figure enemies at you, and with perfectly timed strikes, dodges, and weapon pickups, you become an unstoppable force of destruction.

The animations are ridiculously smooth, the soundtrack is pure adrenaline, and the game constantly introduces new mechanics to keep things fresh. Whether you’re slicing through foes with a sword, launching them into the sky with a well-placed kick, or deflecting bullets mid-air like a true kung-fu master, OFDP2 never stops being fun.

I wish I listened to all the review against this game & saved my money on Digimon World Next Order instead | Das Spiel ist in 2 Spiele geteilt, einmal Cyber Sleuth das Detektiv Spiel und Hacker´s Memory die Hacker Seite.

Ich mag dieses Spiel sehr, du hast verschiedene Digimons, die man trainieren kann und eine gute Story. | I wish they would make more of this series. 

This is the third platform I bought the game on since it originally released on PS4 just to boost sales numbers slightly.

If you like persona, or digimon, or pokemon I recommend this game already.

It's slightly grindy for sure but just set up the xp grind method with the xp USB's and a couple PlatinumNumemon and you'll be set. | Terrible game, locked camera. Aweful game design and boring."
76561197999482693,1075740,Banners of Ruin,6.1,"RPG, Strategy",7,"i played around 10 hours on the switch and my first impressions were mostly positive, the game was fun, original, looked good, but it was pretty imbalanced, some runs i would be hit with some terrible RNG and have 0 chance of finishing it, in other runs i have such good RNG that i have fully leveled character in every slot with no issue, and the endgame was... not good really, it doesnt feel like you accomplished something that you care about.
After such a mixed experience im amazed they released not 1 but 4 dlcs, which i have not tried but i assume only makes the imbalancing worst. | This game isn't just another deck builder, its thoroughly tactical and enjoyable. Bear with the info dump of a tutorial though. Once you have started playing it you will get it really fast :) | Visually, Banners of Ruin is stunning, but it just doesn’t offer enough substance to back up its good looks. I really wanted a roguelite deck-builder with meaningful troop placement and movement, but the game barely lets you take advantage of those mechanics. The ruin system, for instance, feels half-baked, and there are so many underwhelming cards that just end up bloating your deck. Recruiting new party members just makes the bloat worse, so a lot of the systems feel like they exist solely to slow you down.

I haven’t tried any of the DLC, but I suspect its required to make the game fun. After a few hours felt like I’d already seen most of what the base game has to offer. Compared to other deckbuilders, Banners of Ruin feels limited and stiff, with slower progression that leans more heavily into grind than strategy. It left me wishing for a deeper system where synergies actually come together in a satisfying way, rather than a handful of random events and mechanics that never quite gel.

Its not completely unplayable, but I'm adding it to the ""unplayable"" steam game category I made so I don't have to look at it, and don't accidentally reinstall it, play it again, and experience the irritable mood it puts me in. | [Note: as of this writing Steam says my play time is 13 minutes probably because I have overwhelmingly been playing this off line.  My actual play time is approaching 40 hours, so this review is not as superficial as the incorrectly listed 13 minutes would imply.  In evidence of my actual play time, I have unlocked 87% of the achievements which I doubt is possible in only 13 minutes of total play.]

On initial playthrough I initially mistook Banners of Ruin as basically as DLC reskin for Slay the Spire being passed off as a different game.  This initial misconception was based on the fact that beyond merely being a deck-building card strategy there are a large number of similarities between the two, most notably the starter-deck for non-DLC-hero-characters in Banners of Ruin superficially looks all but identical to the one from Slay the Spire.  One unlocks cards and talents on repeated playthroughs through experience points just like Slay the Spire.  Even on further playthoughs the “fake ending” with the “fake final boss” being replaced by the option to push further to a proper ending with a real final boss if additional work was done and sacrifices were made, felt almost verbatim from Slay the Spire.  Numerous other smaller things like the racial ability of the weasels to produce three disposable poisoned throwing-blades will also feel a little too familiar.

This initial take, however, proved to be very shallow as while there are many similarities between these two titles there are also a lot of differences to the point where Banners of Ruin is not just effectively a “DLC reskin” of Slay the Spire but is own beast entirely.   Among the many differences between the two titles, the most significant in their differentiation I found to be the approaches in strategy required by Banners of Ruin resulting from the mechanics of positioning with ranks and lanes, as well as the whole aspect of the party / team instead of a single player controlled character as per Slay the Spire.  The interplay of not merely the cards with the cards, or the cards with the races/characters using them – both of which are experienced in Slay the Spire – is made considerably more rich and complicated in Banners of Ruin by interacting the aforementioned pairing combinations between different party members (up to six at a time) in different positions on the board (both absolute and sometimes relative to one another), and also against the positioning of the opponents on their board.  While there were many moments later in Slay the Spire where I had to really stop and think about the best use of my resources across the numerous possibilities presented to me each turn, the possibilities of action in Banners of Ruin in the later game just become shockingly more diverse, rich, and complicated beyond what ever occurs in Slay the Spire.  Most of the time I enjoyed that richness of possibility, but in some difficult and complicated battles I occasionally felt a bit overwhelmed by the massive combinatorics of competing cost-benefit analyses I had to try and weigh against each other to make even a single move.

There seem to be a few subtle bugs, or rather missed mechanic-combinations here and there in Banners of Ruin (at least as of this writing.)  I assume this is a result of the massive amount of potential complexity of operational options possible making play-testing all possible strange and nuanced combinations a little hard.  For example, there is a particular “Sacrifice” card (I forget its exact name among the few that contain the word “sacrifice”) – a card that is clearly about making a blood sacrifice to aid an ally – whose cost can actually be dodged.  I could be wrong, but I am pretty sure it was not intended to allow one to give a ridiculous benefit to an ally at no cost to one’s other character by allowing them to dodge their own self-blood-sacrifice but have it count as properly paid anyway.  Similarly there are a number of cards that specify characters be equipped for either 2-handed weapons or dual wielding, and some of these cards accept both when they don’t specify that (and don’t seem like they should.)  Further on that topic, some of the cards giving bonuses specifically to dual wielding actually also give their bonus to a normal load out consisting of weapon + shield when that looks wrong based on the nature of the card – I believe it was the card “Akimbo” seems to accidentally work in this way.

Banners of Ruin is definitely an enjoyable game and its own thing despite the superficial appearance of high-similarity in mechanics and structure to Slay the Spire, but for reasons I can’t fully understand or articulate I never found Banners of Ruin quite as thrilling or addictive as Slay the Spire.  Slay the Spire is a very high bar IMHO and so that is not a strike against Banners of Ruin that it does quite make it there in my book as it is fairly close.  In Banners of Ruin’s favor, I like the parties, equipment, art, world, and atmosphere a little more than Slay the Spire, but that is a subtle matter of personal taste that many might disagree with. | amo o jogo, mas podia ser maior

Highly recommended to people who enjoy games such as Xcom, Fallout (1 & 2), Commandos and Wasteland. | Some games didn't get a MMORPG.   They shouldn't have a MMORPG.  The sequel isn't a money grab.

This is one of those good ol fashioned games in my oponion.   I played JA1 and JA2 on game tap.  Fun stuff. | First of all, I want to thank the developers for their hard work and dedication to bringing Jagged Alliance 3 to life. It’s clear they had the right intentions, and there are aspects of modernization in the game that I truly appreciate. The updated graphics and the effort to reintroduce beloved mercenaries are noteworthy, and it’s great to see the series revived for a new generation of players.

However, as a long-time fan of the series, I feel that JA3 missed the essence of what made Jagged Alliance 2 so special. The charm wasn’t just in the mechanics; it was in the little things—like the way mercenaries bantered, the thrill of assembling your perfect squad, and the immense satisfaction of surviving a tough firefight. These details made it feel personal and immersive, more than just a tactical game.

With JA3, while the modernization is appreciated, the soul of the series feels diluted. Perhaps this is because the focus leaned more toward surface-level improvements (like graphics and accessibility) rather than capturing the depth and charm that resonated so deeply with players of the earlier titles.

P.S. This is purely my personal opinion, and I respect the hard work that went into making this game. As an old fan of the series, I simply wanted to share my perspective and hope future updates or installments can bridge the gap between nostalgia and innovation. | Gem of a game. 

This channels so many good things from the 90's games (and a few bad things).

The turn based team level combat is best in business for a shooting based game.

The freedom of choice in progression is beautiful and the different mercs spice it up even more. It offers the possibility of discovering things yourself like few games these days do. The bad side of that is that sometimes it offers this possibility on things it should tell you about and sometimes some quests just seem to get bugged (or maybe they would've required some team member you didn't have to work?). Some I did and the game did not register them as done and I'm pretty sure one I didn't do anything for but the game just told me I had done a quest as soon as I entered the area.

But the important thing to understand is that you can compensate for the few issues by simply saving on so many different save slots that if things get whacked you can just go back to an earlier save instead of starting from scratch.

If turn based combat is your cup of tea, I highly recommend this game."

Larian在此呈现的，远非寻常意义上的电子游戏。
作为游戏，各种设计完美衔接，恰到好处；自由度高到令人发指，你可以做你自己；装备/等级/数据都是精心设计，兼顾了最大公约数；
作为音乐，Down by the river随河风飘扬成流动的叙事，I Want to Live在抉择时刻撕开灵魂，The Power见证胜利后紧握棱镜的双手，各类主题曲契合场景主题，已然挣脱媒介的桎梏，变成可以交互的交响诗，让我事后还反复专门聆听感慨；
作为剧本，这内容本身就是很精彩的小说，作者们绝对有撰写一部畅销魔幻小说的深厚功力。正义/邪恶，生存/死亡，杀戮/放生等人性和生命的主题引人哲思；如果去电影院是用2.5h欣赏了一部有深度的电影，那么在BG3，你是用100h+去体验有无奈有选择有善恶的跌宕魔幻人生。

至此，我的龙与地下城故事已封存在剑湾的晚风中，有生之年，我还会再体验阿斯代伦和其它角色的一生。或许这正是CRPG的伟大之处：它允许我们在现实生活的夹缝里，体验无数个未曾活过的自己。

虽然也能看到一些对BG3批评改进的意见，但是瑕不掩瑜，个人认为有些地方确实可以再改进以方便玩家，有些意见却是因人而异而不能算作缺点和批评。

A Love Letter to the Ninth Art – A Middle-Aged Player's 100-Hour Journey Through Baldur's Gate 3

As someone nearing forty, with both elderly parents and young children to care for, finding large chunks of time to sit in front of a computer and savor a game is no easy feat. This Spring Festival, I made up my mind to finally taste this cup of coffee that had been brewing for years. With the understanding and support of my wife (for which I am deeply grateful), I managed to carve out a week to indulge in uninterrupted play. After 99 hours and 40 minutes, I completed the game. Sitting in front of the screen late at night, I was left in awe, unable to shake the profound impact it had on me. This journey will undoubtedly remain one of the most unforgettable experiences of my life, a radiant milestone in my personal gaming history.

What Larian has created here is far from an ordinary video game.

As a game, every design element is seamlessly integrated, perfectly balanced. The freedom it offers is almost overwhelming—you can truly be yourself. The equipment, levels, and stats are meticulously crafted, catering to a broad spectrum of players.

As music, Down by the River drifts with the breeze, becoming a flowing narrative. I Want to Live tears at your soul during moments of decision, and The Power resonates as you grasp the prism in victory. Each theme song fits its scene so perfectly that it transcends the medium, transforming into an interactive symphonic poem that I found myself revisiting and reflecting on long after the game had ended.

As a novel, the content itself is a masterful piece of fantasy literature. The writers clearly possess the skill to craft a best-selling fantasy novel. Themes of justice versus evil, life versus death, and killing versus sparing provoke deep philosophical reflection. If watching a movie in a theater is like spending 2.5 hours appreciating a thought-provoking film, then Baldur's Gate 3 is like spending over 100 hours living a tumultuous, magical life filled with difficult choices and moral dilemmas.

I named my final save file in the camp, where I chatted with everyone before the end, ""Do Not Want to Say Farewell."" After journeying together, sharing both hardships and triumphs with these friends and comrades, I truly wished we could continue living together. I exhausted every dialogue option in the camp, searching for more interactions, especially with Shadowheart, whose seven or eight hugs still lingered with the warmth of data. I couldn’t bear to say goodbye. Yet, Larian, in their cruel yet merciful way, allowed each companion to move forward with their scars—some destined to carry the stars on their shoulders, others to return to the mundane life of hearth and home. This, perhaps, is the most tender form of realism: all encounters must eventually be returned to the passage of time.

Thus, my Dungeons & Dragons tale has been sealed in the evening breeze of the Sword Coast. In this lifetime, I will return to experience the lives of Astarion and other characters. Perhaps this is the greatness of CRPGs: they allow us, in the crevices of our real lives, to live countless versions of ourselves we never had the chance to be.

While there are some criticisms and suggestions for improvement regarding BG3, they are minor blemishes on an otherwise flawless gem. Some aspects could indeed be tweaked for player convenience, while others are subjective preferences rather than flaws.

Once you’ve spent 10-15 hours learning the game’s mechanics and fundamental principles, crossing that threshold, you can’t help but marvel at how Larian managed to create such a masterpiece. If this work remains unrivaled, it’s because it is truly exquisite and deserves to be cherished. If it is ever surpassed, then another jewel will have been added to the annals of gaming history, another gift for us all.

Thank you, Larian. | The replayability of this game is insane, Larian did an amazing job giving us exactly what we wanted and maybe even a little more. This game has taken over my life and I love it so much, lol, and showing no signs of putting it down any time soon! | This is probably going to be one of the best games for the next decade, the voice acting is sublime and the writers seemed to have made deals with the devil in order to make such a good tale. 10/10 | I started playing this game a year and a few months after it was launched and immediately got into character creation which took me over an hour not to mention building my Dream Guardian. Since purchasing it at full price, I was weary to buy a game for 60 bucks, but it has been the best 60 bucks I've spent in a LONG time. 

The whole game itself doesn't hold your hand during the game, but it does help you build up your skills and learn how to play as you go which is great for those who haven't played CRPG turn based game before. I have basically played this nonstop since October to pass time and as you can see with my 527 hours on record, I absolutely LOVE this game. The options for responses and endings are endless. I'm thoroughly blown away with the voice acting and, yes, the mod options. There are many people who hate playing with mods, but to me it adds a lot to the game and enhances my game play experience making me want to play it more. I have done numerous campaigns and as of January 2025, I'm doing my 2nd durge campaign trying to play a somewhat evil character which is hard as I've cried from being evil to pixels haha. 

Overall, I think this game may be the best game I've ever played and I love how Larian and the VA's show their active participation in the community along with Larian giving us FREE updates and gives modders the toolkit. This company could've charged $100 or more for this game with the amount of work and thought put into it along with the (again) FREE updates, but they didn't. They have shown they care more for the player's experience and making a game that out beats other new games and certain *ahem developers AHEM Bethesda* by giving us a game that is completed at release (from what I've been told by other gamers who played this at release). I recommend this game to anyone who wants a rich, fulfilling game that doesn't have any extra catches outside the initial price. | I have played this game for 6 hours (2h on character creator), never played this type of game before.. can say I am impressed and enjoying it a lot.

18 hours in the game: I think that I'm addicted. The stories are surprising and wholesome. I feel like a hero in this game, living for the good of the people.

50 hours: I finally finished act 1. And oh boy did I turn from good to evil with every step I took. I didn't mean to be... How was I supposed to know that pulling the wrong lever, I'll be catapulting a gnome to space. That wasn't my fault.

80 hours: Yes! Give me your gold. All the shiny trinkets you have. Give me your soul and all the power you hold. Give me more... MORE!

100 hours: How dare you look down on me, thinking like you could ever defeat me?! Hit me with all you got, it will never be enough!

120 hours: ... *only screams echo in the darkness* ...

130 hours: *Muahahaha-*
You may call me the blood queen,
but your agenda is also driven by greed.
The battle you lost, your advisors lied.
Your heroes are dead, your city is mine.
No evil as dark or vengeance as red,
have never been seen as I took the kings head."

Cada personagem tem seu estilo e possui 4 ataques diferentes e 2 especiais com animações bem legais. A história do jogo é até interessante e é contada em um modo RPG que você pode jogar solo ou em coop. O game também possui um modo online, mas atualmente não há jogadores. Graficamente, o jogo é bonito, no estilo anime, o que é ótimo para quem curte, assim como eu. As músicas também são ótimas, contendo faixas instrumentais e cantadas que são as melhores, para dar aquela empolgação.

•  Pontos negativos é que já existem duas versões mais atualizadas do game, o Granblue Rising e o Relink, com gráficos melhorados, novos personagens e muito mais. Alguns personagens, mapas e skins (skins simples que só mudam as cores de roupas, cabelos, etc.) são comprados separadamente. Porém, se seu computador for de entrada, ainda assim é uma boa opção, pois o jogo é leve e divertido. Recomendo comprar quando estiver em uma boa promoção.

•  Observação: Todas as skins de armas você consegue só jogando o modo RPG, e muitas skins de cores dos personagens também.

( Platina ) Média - Algumas conquistas são no modo online e em coop. Devido às versões mais atuais do game, esse aqui está morto. Mas se você encontrar alguém para te ajudar, vai ser tranquilo, pois são conquistas fáceis e rápidas de se fazer.

""Granblue Fantasy: Versus"" — это игра, которая начинается как классический файтинг, а заканчивается как эпическое приключение, где ты — не просто боец, а настоящий герой, который сражается за справедливость и славу. Это как ""Уличный боец"", только вместо Рю у тебя Каталина, а вместо Кена — какой-то парень с гигантским мечом.

Сначала всё кажется простым: ты выбираешь персонажа, выходишь на арену и начинаешь бить врагов. Но потом ты понимаешь, что каждый бой — это как выбор между жизнью и смертью. Ты учишься комбо, улучшаешь свои навыки, находишь лучшие атаки, а потом вдруг понимаешь, что твой меч — это не меч, а просто палка, которая сломается после первого удара. И ты начинаешь искать новые атаки, новые комбо и новые способы победить. И знаете что? Это чертовски захватывающе!

А ещё в игре есть сюжет. О, этот прекрасный сюжет, который заставляет тебя задуматься о смысле жизни, дружбе и справедливости. Вот ты идёшь, такой уверенный в себе, а потом бац! — тебя встречает какой-то злодей, который хочет уничтожить мир. И ты начинаешь сражаться, как будто от тебя зависит судьба мира.

Геймплей — это отдельная история. Сначала ты думаешь: ""Ну, это просто файтинг, ничего особенного"". А потом ты понимаешь, что каждый бой — это как выбор между жизнью и смертью. Ты учишься драться, улучшаешь свои навыки, находишь лучшее оружие, а потом вдруг понимаешь, что твой меч — это не меч, а просто палка, которая сломается после первого удара. И ты начинаешь искать новый меч, новую броню и новые способы выжить. И знаете что? Это чертовски захватывающе!

А ещё в игре есть мультиплеер. О, этот прекрасный мультиплеер, где ты можешь сражаться с друзьями или случайными игроками. Вот ты идёшь, такой уверенный в себе, а потом бац! — тебя встречает какой-то парень с гигантским мечом, и ты начинаешь бежать, как будто от тебя зависит судьба мира.

Но самое прекрасное в ""Granblue Fantasy: Versus"" — это её атмосфера. Звуки битвы, крики персонажей, шум ветра — всё это создаёт ощущение, что ты действительно находишься на арене. И ты начинаешь бояться каждого удара, каждого звука, каждого движения.

Итог: ""Granblue Fantasy: Versus"" — это идеальная игра для тех, кто хочет почувствовать себя настоящим героем, но при этом не готов к реальным опасностям. 10/10, но только если ты готов к тому, что твоя жизнь превратится в бесконечный цикл ""ещё один бой"". И помни: в ""Granblue Fantasy: Versus"" нет лёгких путей, есть только твоя смекалка и немного удачи. | Jogo é bom, mas tomou powercreep para a versão 2 dele."

76561197999482693,1102190,Monster Train,110.6,Strategy,31,"Monster Train is a deck-building game. It's following in the footsteps of other great games like Slay the Spire. As a result, I will be comparing this game to Slay the Spire a lot.

In Monster Train, you defend a train full of (you guessed it) monsters. You fight a series of battles, with each battle involving a bunch of minor enemies followed by a major (boss) enemy. In-between battles you do some deck construction using various stations. One run takes about 60 to 90 minutes.

I've gotten 85 hours of fun out of this game.

THE GOOD:
- Monster Train is a really fun card battler.
- The train level mechanic, where you have 4 different levels in your train, adds a lot of strategic depth and novelty.
- You can always refuse a new card or artifact, something I always wished I could do in Slay the Spire—which would force me to take cards I didn't want and then make it really hard to get rid of them.
- It's also easier to remove cards you don't want, often allowing you to craft the deck you want by the endgame.
- The game lets you know who the major bosses are at the very start of the run. This allows you to build your deck accordingly.
- Great variety of enemies, cards, and special abilities.
- Great learning curve, as new concepts are gradually introduced so you don't have to drink from a firehose of knowledge.
- Nice graphics and music.

THE BAD:
- There is no real story to the game. There's kind of the veneer of a story, but it doesn't really explain why you need to do multiple runs.
- Even with the better control over your deck than other games in the genre, you are still at the mercy of the random number generator. It can be frustrating to lose because you never found the cards you needed, or because of a terrible draw for an otherwise great deck.
- The game developers claim this game is a roguelike, but it's not really. You play to unlock new features, which is a good tutorial mechanic, but to be a roguelike the game should require you to learn by failing. I won on my second attempt.

THE UGLY:
- In this game the protagonists are the demons of Hell, and you actually fight against Heavenly angels. This doesn't bother me, but you might find it offensive.
- When using a mouse and dragging a card to play it, if you linger the game can automatically scroll up to a level above. This is a great way to ruin your battle by playing the card on the wrong level!
- The game enables you to ramp up the difficulty with a feature called the Covenant. This is ostensibly a good thing that gives the game some extra life and challenge. Unfortunately, in trying to find a variety of ways to increase the difficulty the game designer has mainly made the game more annoying. They add lots of junk cards to your deck and make it harder to remove those cards. Hence, rather than ending with a bang, the game kind of fizzled out with a whimper as I got increasingly frustrated and quit.
 | I'll be honest. I didn't like it that much. Primarily because the game at higher difficults devolves into gigagbuffing one monster to solo the final boss. Still though learning the game was great. | I played this roguelite cards battler on various platforms, gamepass pc ,xbox and steam, and its a great game. Fun. 
For me the progression of the game is really good, while you play more you unlock fun other stuff. The combinations are a blast, you can make over the top OP cards. I like the sounds when the train is totaly full and your cards all packed with buffs, the sound is not beautiful, but catching, and I like the raw sound of the abilities clashing into each other.
Its cool and easy to play some rounds, make comobs and have fun.
Game is fun and well made, for sure worth your time

 | I stand by my early impressions that the UI clashes terribly in this game. For context, I've played and love Slay the Spire, and I THOUGHT I'd like Monster Train, but I thought it was kind of ugly...I admit I wasn't in the mood to give it a fair shake, and it is now starting to click with me. It's good, but not great, with tremendous replay value. | High Quality Time Deleting Machine. I have hundreds of hours on mobile as well.

你6.0更新的啥玩意？减溅射数量，搞得很多怪步、怪骑和巨兽的多段连击无法生效（连击动作会平分溅射数量，并向下取整，导致部分连击动作的攻击目标为0，完全没有伤害。比如基斯里夫熊骑兵，有个熊左右拍掌+下砸的三连攻击动画，但是熊骑兵更新后的溅射数量只有1，导致这个三连击动作的平均攻击目标都为0，食人魔噬人者也因为溅射数量少打不过一些低级矛兵），很多反步的怪兽在6.0更新后连帝国长戟都打不过。

然后最近的更新了修复溅射问题，结果只修复了多模组的怪步和怪骑，巨兽没修，导致震旦的陶俑直接大废物一个，因为陶俑的大风车有十几次连击，这个长动作在目前版本直接0伤害，问就是溅射模组不够分，震旦人不配玩这个游戏是吧。

However, what it does well it does really well like no other:

After a long day's march, your dwarves begin digging into the top of a hillside overlooking a long valley below. Your scouts have determined a large horde of skaven are sulking in the shadows somewhere nearby. You do not know yet if they will give battle in the morning or will instead cowardly skulk off during the night, but it's best to be prepared for a fight regardless.

Your left flank is densely wooded and covered by a few detachments of veteran Longbeards and Rangers. Their lines have to be uncomfortably thinned out to cover the broad front before them but the terrain should make a big attack unlikely. Not to mention rats are notoriously too hasty and uncoordinated to make good such a venture. Visibility is poor however so who knows what will be unveiled in the underbrush when the morning fog lifts.

You are strongest in the center flank, among the ragged ruins of an ancient castle near the top of the hill where you have made your encampment for the night.  The approach is difficult with many cliffs and boulders funneling any would-be attackers into a few narrow channels. Your Ironbreakers and Warriors find an eeire silence as they steadily work to fortify their positions before dawn, the quiet only broken by the occasion sharp, high-pitched screech echoing in the distance. Just above their location a couple of regiments of Quarrelers have been stationed to provide much-needed ranged cover for any scrum that may occur.

On the right flank you find a steep, open slope that would provide any hopeful assailant easy access into the heart of your position.  Here you decide to make your rat trap. At the base of your position you place your unfortunate bait, a skirmish line of stout and steady Miners. Behind them you place your spring, heavily armed Hammerers who are always eager to join then finish a fight. On a bluff overlooking them all you place your deadly and explosive Thunderers. You are optimistic that your firepower advantage can shock and break your enemy before their vast numeric superiority overwhelms you.

Your reserves are located In the rear on a grassy plain on the very top of the hill.  A detachment of unruly, death-seeking Slayers await to be rushed into combat to plug any holes that enemy monsters may make. Three batteries of organ guns prepare to paint the palette of enemy forces with iron spray from their barrels. Your lone Gyrocopter attachment is ready to lumber off to any location that is requested.

As the darkness finally lifts you find yourself peering into the distance, searching for any sign of the enemy. You don't have to look for long. The adjacent hillsides are awash with ugly, putrid rat men, quite visible despite the gray of the morning. You make a quick estimate and figure that the vermin horde must easily number into the tens of thousands. According to the last count from your quartermaster, you have 1753 dwarf ready for duty. The day should be very interesting.... | Game is good and feels like every other Total War. This review isn't negative because the game itself, its a fun game but Creative Assembly is nothing but a bunch of crooks at this point. Locking units from a base game faction behind a paywall is ridiculous.

DLC's are meant to be addons for flavor and revitalize playthroughs. CA continues to use them as a way to hold the base game hostage and force its players to spend mass amounts of money just to get the bare minimum.   Honestly fuck CA at this point. | NOTA: 8/10

The shooting, the art, the sound—everything about it is the industry's best, held back by draconian progression systems and temporary-by-design story content. I imagine this game is comparable to something like heroin: it feels [i]so good[/i]... until it doesn't. And then you're stuck chasing the dragon. No other developer exhibits such frustrating inconsistency of quality and consideration for its players. The future of this live service game is uncertain, and that's a real shame because I'm pretty sure nothing will ever be as good as this game can be, could have been, should have been. | I... Just can't anymore.
When Bungie actually puts in effort into their game (Aka, major DLC's minus lightfall) the game is amazing, but the amount of times they have dropped the ball, especially with this last episode/season has finally done it for me. I've followed Destiny since the original on the xbox 360, became a fan of the story, and continued on into Destiny 2 back when they were still part of activision on battlenet. I've always attempted to keep good faith and put in a good word even when the game was at a low point, but now after having the saint-14 and osiris gay love story interjected and shoved down my throat multiple times, the last season ""echos"" big bad guy get one shot in a cutscene and escape by floating down a vex ""milk"" river, and now the current episode which started by reusing a game mode that they butchered and made worse than the original which was still in the game and the other gamemode that came later which was decent but had loot that you could get just by running around in the standard maps made it not at all worth doing. Compound that with the tonic system that relied on Strict RNG to get new tonics which were necessary to get further in the reputation system and played a minimal part in the over arching story and took forever just to get three tonics out of DOZENS WHICH BARELY WORKED AND WAS ON A TIMER THAT YOU HAD TO MICRO MANAGE ON TOP OF OTHER MICRO MANAGING SYSTEMS.... yeah it was just TOO MUCH.  The final nail in the coffin was the fact that we found out just how much work they put into the seasonal / episodic content which normally is spread out when they gave it all at one time. By the way you could do all 3 parts of revenant in less than 3 hours which for something that you pay for is absolutely Pathetic. For comparison Warframe Is completely 100% FREE and has proven to have a better player experience, impactful story, developers that actually care, better visuals, smaller file size, did not take paid content away forever (yes that happened in destiny), and more. 

I loved this game because it's story at one point was amazing and now... it's a chore.  Combine all that with the current state of the company's choices and behaviors, it's just not worth trying to keep the rose tinted glasses on and support it anymore.  I loved this game.... and I just feel betrayed and disappointed.  Call me a Schill, say I'm coping, or a hater I no longer care. Like many said Destiny was the only thing that could Kill Destiny, and well they did it.  I'm done supporting Bungie until they get their collective heads out of their ass.

Edit as to Toasty's comments, I don't care if Osiris and Saint are gay, I care that the fact that they are gay is more of a Slap to the face and is way too frequent as a main story beat, it's not subtle like other characters and kept in the background as an aspect of the character which would have made the first Episode much more impactful story wise. As Toasty mentioned Warframe has these notions and explores it but it's subtle and not in  your face and distracting from the overall story which is why I exemplify it's story over This one. Take that as you will but I stand with my choice and opinion, don't be assholes just because you disagree and have a different opinion.

For those who didn't fixate on being jerks trying to demonize another person,

Thank you.

For the rest of you pathetic losers who chose to HATE me because of your own personal LGBTQ AGENDAS over know that this review and opinion will never come down of my own volition but comments for this review will now be locked for YOUR HATRED towards me.

The lot of you should be Ashamed of yourselves. | 10 year veteran of the franchise. this new season brings to me the unfortunate realization its over. the game had the most amazing expansion in its history, just to turn around and fire loads of staff. bungie vets who made this series what it is (was practically) are gone, and you can feel it. new season with no exotic armor at all, mediocre activity that is just the same recycled event, with recycled modifiers from older content that is extremely tiring, just cus it worked once doesnt mean they need to do it 3 or so times. the sandbox is in a pretty great state, but the creativity of the team is dying out, and the lack of employees and budget is extremely obvious. Pete Parsons is directly responsible for cutting hundreds of devs and bringing this ship crashing into the ground. Destiny is genuinely unenjoyable and within the hour i was bored. this is genuinely depressing as i have thousands of hours, and thousands on psn and have loved the game through some of its lowest points. but the mediocrity of this season is killing me. i genuinely am worried this game will actually die for real within this act. | I think this is the best game ever made and it's not very close. I started playing around the time it went free to play and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. No other game does what this one does. I think everyone should get to experience what Destiny offers. This rating is positive because of what this game has meant to me, not because of what it has become.

[i]Currently:[/i]

	[*]This game is so unfairly priced that I can't genuinely recommend any of my non-Destiny friends or new players to pick it up to try it out.
	[*]The community is toxic as hell.
	[*]The game is dying, fewer and fewer people get on to play every single day.
	[*]There are cheaters in 1/3 of Crucible games (might just be caused by the dwindling player count making the concentration of cheaters higher).
	[*]Every new update is bugged (sometimes to the point of unplayability) and results in either server downtime, another update to address it (takes a month for this to get released), or Bungie just giving up and auto-completing quest steps.
	[*]The new player onboarding experience is abysmal. You're given a 5 minute cutscene to explain the story (since they completely removed the real campaign), a couple of introductory quests, and then you're kicked out of the bird's nest to do whatever your heart desires with minimal direction or suggestion on where to go. So bad, in fact, that Bungie has given up and now provides players with an option to skip it entirely since they know that if a new player is playing this game, it MUST be at the direction of another existing player telling them what to do anyway.
	[*]The game is riddled with power creep. Guardian kits are the strongest they have ever been and new aspirational content has gotten easier and easier.
[/list]

Realistically, the game needs a reset like Destiny 1 got with the release of Destiny 2, but Bungie's insistence on this being a forever game post-Final Shape has led to Destiny 3 being nothing but a pipe dream while this game wanes in its final days after the equivalent of an Avenger: Endgame story beat. Bungie just doesn't know when to let it go.

It is really opaque in terms of understanding what to do. I get it for the rituals, but for many decisions it feels like I should just play the game 1000 times and then I'll be good at it. But it's not fun enough to get to that point honestly. 
Sometimes seemingly minor decisions have immense consequences (lose a battle and lose 80 goods worth 80 herds), while you click your way through a lot of decisions which look important but have very minor consequences (+1 mood, a clan mocks you). 
The battle system feels way too RNG based, you clearly have the upper hand, but somehow the enemy while losing men left and right will gain two advantages and you lose. 
The system of obtaining lore is weird; it would be good if there was some guidance even if vaguely how to get that. | Esse e King of Dragon Pass estão entre os melhores RPGs já feitos.

・部外者への扱いは「市民として受け入れた」を選んだ方が良いです。
・ゲームのリロードは無制限にすることをお勧めします。 | Played it some time ago, got bored and put it aside to revisit later.

This time, I took the time to read the lore, get more invested in what I was doing, and enjoyed it more as a result. There is coherency behind the story, like an imagined culture not unlike those of ancient civilisations. All in all, it's an improvement to their first game. 

During rituals, it was a bit confusing as to why I'd follow the lore but would lose, so the feedback could have been a bit better around that. At some point I randomly started picking options more suited to the strengths of the quester and started ignoring the lore, and the rituals started going more smoothly after that. Maybe that's what Hyalor meant by choosing your own path? 

I played through aggressively three times, and ended up losing each time. The fourth time, I played a bit more diplomatically, and as a result managed to wed Beren to his love. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that is what led to a win. 

Each time I lost due to a Ram invasion from the south, they would say they'd learned to ride horses from some Rider I'd never heard of. When one of the options was for Beren to teach them how to ride, I realised that if I taught them...the invaders couldn't come! Excite.

76561197999482693,1184840,Chaos Galaxy,4.783333333333333,"Indie, Strategy",3,"I had to play this for a while to realize I got what I wanted out of the game, but I still find it hard to recommend. If you played the developer's previous title set in the same universe, you will see countless ways this game takes one step forward but two steps back. Most of my review will make comparsions to the game Chaos Sector since is the best way to understand if this game is for you or not. 

Unlike Chaos Sector you can freely roam with your fleets across the galaxy, but is a massive time wasters and if you have a war declared far away from you a lot of turns can pass before any battles get to take place. Is also why sieges feel like such a slough, depleting the defence number either by bombing or ground invasion over multiple turns really bloats the play time in comparsion to the previous iteration just having you fight a battle for a planet and being done with it. The battle map is also worse, there is a lot more clutter, personal example being with the faction East Galaxy Corp's commander Black Beared whilst using their specialist unit the Kraken Class Submarine, that unit has a whomping eight movement opportunities but those tiles you can traverse is easily covered up by the UI showing is health energy and moral. Is a big problem since those units are meant for ambushes and not being able to use them properly due to a problem not even present in the previous title is a real blunder. There are certain other aspects this game does better than Chaos Sector such as the commanders being able to act out seperate objectives on their own, instead of just being able to work on one project at a time, you can exploit your numbers to fight multiple battles or develope worlds across. Speaking of development, is the best part. You both have the old increasing taxation and defence, but you also do it passivly with commanders assigned as governors. So it become a nice balance act of either spending money on a plant to get more in the short term, or saving money and earning free development in the long term. The cap on planets resource output seems to be reasonable from experince doing two campaigns so far. Compared to the previous game, this has a wealth of content and multiple victory conditions. It even has more replay value thanks to the various events that break and form new factions which is a nice treat. Late game I can't judge yet, but I fear from my meager experince it is too easy for certain factions to blob and reach a state were they can simply out number your commanders and take your worlds cause you can't engage them all in battles at once. I struggle a lot with recruitment compared to the AI getting commanders like free candy but this might be personal inexperienced with these type of strategy games. The battles themselves as I touched on seem like a major downgrade compared to the previous title as I experinced problems with the UI blocking the screen unlike the much better placed one in Chaos Sector, the battles are also very one sided and the reinforcment mechanic is a novelty most of the time since most battles are based on first turn advantage and not defensive passive fleets (oh also they just take too long to show up, so if you are far from the enemy so are your reinforcments and if you are close you win too fast for them to help). Diplomancy is a joke, I do not bother making friends or alliances. I heavily abused the vassal stance to declare war with a soverign backing me up and tieing down the enemy fleets whilst I nab the exposed planets for myself. Whilst leaving my liege when I just wanted to conquer on my own or could not bother waiting on a truce (such as when I was about to take a planet and my liege made peace with the enemy, forcing my hand to revoke my vassal stance). There is also events that just give bad relation, so if you are offered to be annaxed, no shit it gives you a game over but please just have it auto resolve instead and give me the minus imperial relation instead of wasting time with a easy to miss press instant game over button. 

I want to make clear that this is not a bad game, but is slow and it rewards the player that takes their time each turn even when you just want to mash the pass turn button. I do enjoy my time fighting battles and forming the best combination of units for each faction. I just know how this game will frustrate others. I still want to show my support towards the devloper since I did buy all their games and have enjoyed them. This one just had many more faults compared to Chaos Sector. | 不错"

Overall this pack is really good, I'd say it's worth | Oh hey, my profile picture is one of the devils from The Devils and the Details. Either way...

Tl;dr of my mini-reviews of each game: This pack is still very solid, even though with some games there are small ""ughs"".

---------------

Quiplash 3: Aesthetically one of the more unique ones of the Jackbox series, featuring claymation-style elements. Quiplash is Quiplash, you fill in the blanks of sentences and make a ha-ha. The only caveat I have with this version is the music - in the soundtrack it's fine, but during gameplay, it's intimidating even... but it's easily brushed off.

The Devils and the Details: Hhhhhhhh - mixed feelings. It's a group game where some tasks are independent, some require teamwork. You fill a bar with the tasks you do and move to the next day. Here, it really depends on the group of people you are playing with - playing with people other than those that you have vocal contact with is borderline impossible, just because of the teamwork-required tasks. Even then, this is something I occasionally play with a group of people and get joy out of it. Occasionally = far less than the other games, but still played.

Champ'd Up: To this day, still probably the best drawing game in Jackbox Packs. You draw characters based on a prompt, and then get a rival whose appearance you see, but don't know the prompt. Then they fight each other. It's so simple in concept, but really fun. Also, bonus points to the music - Andy Poland went hard and I appreciate it, really digging the electronic music mixed with march band drums. Kinda reminds me of Death Grips' earlier works through that.

Talking Points: Vocal improvisation, the game - speaking is mandatory in this game, and so, should be played with those with vocal contact. You get a topic for a slideshow, but don't know the pictures that a different player chooses for you. This game usually gets extremely restless and out-of-bounds, which can be really fun at times. Freeplay-mode for this is an odd choice.

Blather 'Round: This game is one of my go-to games when introducing Jackbox to other players (others being Tee K.O. and Guesspionage). You get a thing that you have to explain about with using cryptic words, and give ""praise/discipline"" to player-given answers (in other words, you can agree, or don't agree with a word to lead others onward). Fun and engaging, best with a big player group. This game should've gotten the Freeplay-mode, but I guess such wasn't picked up for the potential difficulty of giving custom words the prompts that the game gives you?"
76561197999482693,1217060,Gunfire Reborn,17.15,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG",27,"While I appreciate the character DLCs, I don't really like the direction this game has taken for replayability. Having seasonal mechanics tacked on seems like the easy approach but doesn't add much to the overall game. They really should take the Dead Cells model with the stage scheming and add more branching zones and tilesets to make things feel fresh. Add more variety to the rooms per stage, like with the recent anxi desert change. Stick to one overarching mechanic that players can keep grinding on instead of adding seasonal ones that shift character useability and run approach every 4 months.

Subsequent updates also seem to be introducing some lag to the game. Tabbing out, even in singleplayer makes the game hang for a split second. Entering one room in multiplayer after someone else causes the game to hang at times. If the devs really do want to stick to the seasonal plan, then expand the skins to include the characters as well and make them limited to events! Soul essence is already a persistent currency that players can acquire with a grind. | I've sunk a few hundred hours into this game; once you grasp the connections between guns, abilities, and scrolls, it becomes  seriously addicting. I've played every season variation, and the way star link expands upon your character build is the most fun yet. I can easily justify $20 due to the amount of content it offers. | I didn't give this game much thought until I started playing it. The game is a well-made rogue-lite that's fun to play. The experience is even better with friends, up to three people, or you can find online matches.
I've highlighted 3 points that I think are important to mention:

Seasons
The season system is well-made. I've only played the last 2 seasons. At first, it's hard to understand the mechanics, but you get the hang of it over time. You just have to pay close attention to the readings, but they're very fun and varied. The season pass is free, easy and quick to get, and gives you beautiful and well-made cosmetics, which is a very positive point.

Replayability
I particularly enjoyed replaying the game. Putting on a playlist to listen to while playing is a pleasant experience. The game has many achievements and some of them require time and effort to complete, a huge variety of weapons to unlock, which gives a great feeling when you get a new weapon, in days when in any game you have to keep paying to get new things in the game (the game has 3 DLC with weapons, but the game also adds free weapons in each season).

Game modes
The game has few modes, only three, being the conventional mode, the main game mode where you have the stages and their difficulty to choose and challenge yourself and it is in this mode that you unlock most of the weapons and achievements in the game. The daily challenge mode, nothing special, the name already says what it is, a mode with a modifier that changes daily, just to get some achievements and challenge yourself. And the last mode, the horde mode, is a mode where you can equip some improvements to your characters and fight against large hordes of enemies that get harder and harder over time, but it has a final boss, so the hordes end. It's fun, but it only has two maps so far, and it ends up being repetitive.

My final thoughts are that the game is worth it for those who like games of this style, it's very different and diverse from the others. For the base game I think the price is worth it, but for the DLC I think it's worth waiting for a sale.

Existem 12 personagens jogavéis que são bicinhos bem fofinhos (não sei se chega a ser furry), em que todos possuem 2 habilidades unicas e especiais, dando uma pegada de que cada run seja realmente diferenciada e unica. 6 são free, onde você desbloqueia apenas jogando, e os outros 6 são de dlc's. 

O jogo possui bastante coisa legal, como uma variedade boa de armas, inimigos, pergaminhos para buildar e uma arvore de talentos bacana até.
Durante a play, você vai se deparar com 3 steps até o final. É como se fosse o começo, meio e fim, bem padrão!! E em cada stage diferente, existe a possibilidade de vir 2 tipos de chefes. É sempre sortido, nunca da pra saber ao certo quem vai vir. 

Agora, como eu disse la em cima, no começo era realmente f0da de jogar sozinho. Eu até tive a cara de pau de sair chamando usuarios aqui da Steam pra jogar junto a mim, mas foi tudo em vão, infelizmente kkkkkkkk. Masssss, acabei descobrindo que da pra colocar bots [IA] pra ajudar e facilitar a gameplay!!! E isso foi extremamente util. *-* 
Eles até atacam, mas no geral são bem ignorantes KKKKKKKKKK, o que de fato eles são bons é em te levantar quando você é derrubado por algum monstro, assim evitando que sua jornada seja finalizada precocemente!!!!! 

Os graficos até que são decentes. Os mapas e cenarios são bem variados! Alguns são curtos e outros extensos. A arte do jogo é legal e a trilha sonora é meio chatinha mas da pra se acostumar.
Uma coisa que eu não curti muito foi que pra jogar no controle é meio ruimzinho. Eu sugiro muito que se você puder, jogue com um mouse & teclado. No joystick da pra brinca de boa, mas vai por mim e confia no que eu to falando!!!!!!!!!! Outro ponto também é a fisica e movimentação dos bonecos. É tudo muito duro, meio travado! Parece que os bichos tão com 500kg de concreto nas roupas huehuehuehuehue. 
Mas enfim... creio eu que isso seja proposital do jogo mesmo. Até porque tem itens que te dão um pouqinho a mais de velocidade. 

E pra encerrar, se você quer muito jogar sofrendo o minimo possivel eu recomendo duas coisas: a primeira é que jogue com amigos e conhecidos!!!! Vai ser bemmmmmmm mais ""suave"" a caminhada de todos até ficarem full broken. E a segunda é, caso for jogatinar sozinho, compre a DLC chamada Artisan and Magician. Vai por mim, de longe este conteudo adicional é DISPARADO o melhor de todos. Ela possui uma personagem bem OP que vai melhorar bastante o seu early game. 

E é isso aew galera. Sem sombra de duvidas recomendo simmmmmmmmmm Gunfire Reborn a todo mundo!!!!!!!!!!! Muito obrigado a você que chegou até aqui, um forte abraço e nos vemos nas proximas analises. Até la, bjbjbjbj e fuyyyyyyyyyyyy :* õ/ 


NOTA – 1O/1O | A fun roguelite shooter with well implemented gunplay and lots of arms to experiment with different mechanics. If you need a time sink, go for it."
76561197999482693,1224290,Horizon's Gate,6.733333333333333,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",3,"I am deeply and truly shocked by how GOOD this game is.
It looks simple and it is easy to learn but its mechanics are very deep and complex. Take sea battles, for example. For a start, you have a simple ship with simple cannons. They can shoot... and that's about it. But! Even at this early stage you see glimpses of the deep that hides under the surface. Because your ship, simple as it is, has 3 different speeds according to the wind's direction, cargo space, hull strength and crew... which consists of distinct characters, every one of which can be trained in any unlocked class, equipped with your chosen weapons, trinkets and consumables. Why is it so important? Because during sea battles you can board all enemy ships and even many of the sea monsters - and they can board you - initiating a tactical battle using your crew! And this is only the beginning. Your cannons have different firing distances and firing angles, you can find and/or buy beam cannons, lightning cannons, slowing cannons, cannons that freeze enemies and even water on the map, cannons that have 360 degree firing angle, cannons that damage enemy crew... You can add a lot of different ships to your fleet - ironclads, living regenerating ships, even some of the monsters that you fight. 
Simple in concept, very deep and satisfying in further study.
It can be said about land (or boarding) battles also. You are controlling a party of 5 characters each of whom can have a combination of 2 classes chosen freely that give you all told about 12 active abilities to use in battle... for EACH CHARACTER. We are looking at a whopping 60 abilities in total - and it is without taking into account different consumables and weapons that your characters can have. As a bonus - enemies are working under the same rules as you. They can also have these classes and abilities. They can also have these weapons and consumables. And they can use them pretty intelligently. And this is not all! Maps themselves are no less important. They are full of different hazards, height differences and opportunities. Push an enemy off a cliff! Push an enemy into a wall! Push an enemy into another enemy! Rain water onto them! And then electrify or freeze it! You can walk on ice, you can chop down trees, you can cut or burn away grass, you can blow up walls... Battlefield is changeable and destructible - and it is glorious.
I can rant for a long time, but I'll stop here. Horizon's Gate gives players a large and beautiful world to explore and plunder. I've bought this game on sale because it is the first game from this developer for me and I was not sure I'll like it. I've already bought their next game - Kingsvein - at full price without a doubt. Because I am sure now.
And I hope that we will see Horizon's Gate 2 someday. Sea exploration and battles gel very nicely with amazing tactical combat and a vibrant world that this developer created. I want more. | Que jogo sensacional
Exploração bacana com um mundo grande, com várias dungeons (apesar que simples, sendo que a maioria são só duas salas) e muitas cidades, combate tático que não depende tanto da movimentação e ambiente, mas que entretêm, principalmente pelo sistema de classes, que é viciante e a cereja do bolo é a trilha sonora, que é excelente
O foco tá longe de ser a história, mas é legal e tem uma dungeon inteira fora da casinha pra explicar ela
Não instalei muitos mods, mas tem vários que adicionam muito conteúdo, como quests, locais, classes, mudanças no gameplay, etc.
Se esse jogo tivesse um orçamento um pouco maior para aprofundar o lore dos personagens e os gráficos, seria uma obra prima | Great game that punches way above its weight class. The job system, ship combat, general exploration are all great. I would like to see more of this. The tactical elements are way better designed and implemented than 95% of other tactical rpg type games. | This is a really fun and surprisingly addicting game. If you like exploration in games, tactics games, and role-playing games you will love Horizon's Gate. I really like sailing around, trading, and discovering new areas on the map. Building your landing crew for the FF tactics-esque combat is also a lot of fun. I do wish more of the recruit-able party members had a bit of a personality. But, this is a more game-play focused game so I can let it slide. Overall it is a great deal full price and actually a steal when it goes on sale. I'm leaving this review so hopefully this game can get more attention :) | What a hidden gem of a game.  For those familiar with old'school Uncharted Waters, FFT, and Ultima, this game is a perfect fit.  Tons of classes to work for throughout the entire game without ever really feeling overwhelmed with the options.  Highly recommended even at regular price."

- [i] Humans' capabilities are limited when faced with such difficulties and challenges. But when we overcome it, improvement would be nothing that we have ever seen of. [/i]

9/10 - Astronarch 2 When??? 

This game was a decent RPG auto battler with simple mechanics where of course, you build your own team composition. I like how the game emphasizes the relevancy of classes and their late game capabilities. We could build whatever purpose we want with them as long as you know what to do. A tank could be DPS character, a mage could be a tank, so on and so forth. 

The game is also not one of those easy done, go next. Paying attention to the enemies' powers and passives will be also crucial to winning the game. The ascension / corruption feature may be difficult but challenging enough to make me finish the game to 100% achievement.

It is an underrated RPG game. I hope there would be sequel like how the risk of rain done to expand and make it more immersive.

With the number of hours I'd played I even spent over 100$ supporting the game by buying skins and what not. I enjoyed the flow, the challenge, and the strategy. I know every card. How they're played. How they're countered. 

So why am I giving it a negative review now?  I recently came back to it to find out the game had completely changed. 

Why oh why have the devs decided to remove wild cards (doubles of the same card in the same deck) and duplicate cards (the same card in your teammates deck) in premade team battles?? Half the fun of this game was being able to strategize with a friend and come up with crazy combos, thematic decks, and sometimes just plain goofy ridiculous decks early in the league. I strongly believe the percent chance of drawing a deck defining card or executing your intended combo is a key element of dueling cards in general. Think Magic or Yu Gi Oh. Now a huge part of that fun and build design is just gone.

Effectively, they've changed the game that I originally fell in love with and after over 800 hours I don't think I want to play anymore. What a shame. | Rating: 7/10

Overview: Minion Masters is a fast-paced, free-to-play strategy game that blends elements of tower defense and collectible card games (CCG). Developed by BetaDwarf, the game pits players in 1v1 or 2v2 battles where they summon and control minions to battle against their opponent’s forces, all while managing a deck of cards. With its unique mix of gameplay styles, Minion Masters offers an accessible but strategic experience for fans of both strategy games and card battling.

Gameplay: In Minion Masters, players build and use decks of cards to summon minions, cast spells, and build structures on the battlefield. Each card corresponds to a different type of unit, spell, or structure that players can deploy in real-time. The key to success is not just about deploying powerful units but also about managing your resources (mana), timing your plays, and reacting to your opponent’s strategy.

The game offers several different modes, including standard 1v1 and 2v2, where players can compete against other players or AI. The matches are quick, lasting around 5-10 minutes, which makes it easy to jump into a game and not get bogged down by long sessions. The action is fast-paced, with constant back-and-forth gameplay, making it exciting for those who enjoy real-time strategy with a bit of card game strategy mixed in.

Deck Building and Strategy: The strategic depth of Minion Masters comes from deck building. Players can collect new cards and customize their deck to suit their playstyle, with different minions, spells, and special abilities available to choose from. The key to winning is finding the right balance between offense and defense, while also considering synergy between the cards in your deck. There are a variety of minion types, each with strengths and weaknesses, which adds an extra layer of tactical decision-making to each match.

Progression and Monetization: As with many free-to-play games, Minion Masters includes a progression system where players can unlock new cards and cosmetics by earning rewards from matches or purchasing card packs. While the game is generally balanced and not pay-to-win, there is an option for players to spend money on card packs and other cosmetic items. This could give some players a slight advantage early on, but most progress can still be made through regular gameplay.

Graphics and Performance: Minion Masters features bright, colorful visuals with a somewhat cartoonish art style that fits the fast-paced, playful nature of the game. The minions and spells are well-designed, with each card having its own unique look and animations that help bring the battlefield to life. The game runs smoothly on most systems, and the controls are intuitive, making it accessible for both new players and strategy veterans alike.

Audio Design: The sound design in Minion Masters is solid, with an upbeat soundtrack and engaging sound effects that add to the excitement of the battles. Each card and minion has its own set of sounds, from the footsteps of marching troops to the explosive effects of spells, helping to immerse players in the game’s action. The voice lines of the minions and the announcer are charming and add some personality to the game.

Challenges: While Minion Masters is accessible, there is a learning curve when it comes to building effective decks and mastering the timing and positioning of your units. As players unlock more cards, they can start building more diverse strategies, but the game’s fast pace means you need to react quickly, which can be challenging for newcomers. The game also features matchmaking, but occasionally, you may find yourself up against opponents who have stronger cards if you're not progressing quickly enough.

Final Thoughts: Minion Masters is a fun and fast-paced strategy game that offers a unique blend of collectible card gameplay with real-time strategy. Its quick matches, deck-building mechanics, and strategic depth make it an enjoyable experience for players who enjoy both card games and strategy games. While there’s a progression system that could feel grindy at times, the game remains accessible, and its focus on skill and strategy makes it rewarding for those who stick with it.

Pros:

Fast-paced and accessible gameplay
Strong strategic depth through deck-building and unit placement
Bright, colorful visuals with appealing animations
Free-to-play with fair monetization options
Multiple game modes including 1v1 and 2v2
Cons:

Progression can feel slow at times
Pay-to-progress elements, though not pay-to-win
Some balancing issues, especially at early levels
Can become repetitive if not switching up strategies
Minion Masters is an enjoyable strategy game for those who like quick battles, tactical decision-making, and card collection. While there are some minor progression hurdles, the game offers a solid and fun experience for fans of competitive, strategic gameplay. | This game was fun for a while. I found it late thinking it was a new game. After several months of loving it and playing it almost daily; the fun is now at its end. Nothing new is coming to it. | ""Если бы мне сказали, что я буду проводить ночи напролет, крича на экран из-за толпы миньонов, я бы не поверил. Но вот я здесь, с кругами под глазами и улыбкой до ушей. Minion Masters — это как смесь покера, шахмат и цирка, где все участники слегка не в себе.

Что мне нравится:

Миньоны-психопаты. Серьезно, кто еще будет бросать летающих свиней в драконов? Это гениально!

Стратегия? Шутка? И то, и другое! Ты думаешь, что всё продумал, но тут твой противник выкидывает карту, которая превращает твою армию в лягушек. Лягушек, Карл!

Быстрые матчи. Это как фастфуд, только без угрызений совести. 5 минут — и ты либо герой, либо лузер. Но в любом случае хочется еще.

Что не нравится:

Случайные карты. Иногда тебе выпадает такая рука, что хочется плакать. Но это часть веселья, правда?

Итог: Minion Masters — это идеальная игра для тех, кто хочет немного адреналина, много смеха и возможность почувствовать себя злым гением (или просто неудачником с хорошим чувством юмора). Если вы еще не играли, то что вы вообще делаете со своей жизнью?

基本はデッキ構築ローグライク x ターン制ストラテジーで
①敵の位置と攻撃範囲が決定する
②自分のターン、攻撃したり敵の攻撃を喰らわない様に移動/回避/ブロックする
③敵のターン、行動順の早い敵から行動する

Pros:
+ The combat mechanics. Rooms are not meant to be brute-forced; one has to cleverly move around, hit and go, manipulate the enemies against each other and use the environment to one's advantage in order to be successful. Those who fail to grasp this concept are quickly handed their asses to them (and then they complain about how they only deal 5 damage against four or more 40+ health enemies in a claustrophobic room... /smh)
+ Great looking, minimalist, clean environment art
+ The color-coded enemies and icons make it very easy to read each room and develop a strategy to beat it
+ Fluid, natural character animations. The movement, jumps, hits and and ultimately the brutal finishes are all excellent
+ Clean UI and excellent UX overall

Cons:
- The character art. There is minimalism and there's too much minimalism, i.e. not enough details on the player character and enemies. The devs were aware of this shortcoming and fixed it in the new KiTS game | One of the best deckbuilding roguelikes out there, far surpassing ""Slay the Spire"" and ""Menace from the Deep"" in my opinion. This game always has me coming back to it. As a martial artist myself, specifically a Kickboxer, of course the battle isn't realistic. Some move animations don't quite match the real technique. A good example of this is the ""Jab"" card, which looks more like a lead hook. Still, this game is a blast and I love it. 8.5/10.

 | We need to talk about the music.

76561197999482693,1151340,Fallout 76,1.7666666666666666,RPG,6,"This game could be really amazing. Being a fan of the series, for quite some time, I cannot deny that I liked an experience that strongly reminded me of Fallout 4, a game that I truly loved. However my negative review is based on the following 3 main issues:

[b]I.[/b]	First things first as the game isn’t f2p and carries that kind of price tag, I expected access to a wider variety of content and amenities, which now seem to be locked behind a series of paywalls. Additionally even with a Fallout 1st monthly subscription, which costs extra 15€ and in my opinion is quite overpriced, you still have to further purchase Atoms in order to fully unlock the desired cosmetics and utilities. 

[b]II.[/b]	Secondly the game remains real fun until the moment you discover that your personal stashbox is full. From now on you have to keep a close eye on your inventory, scraping, donating and selling equipment that you may want to keep but cannot store. In a survival game where scavenging is a core mechanic, constantly worrying about your limited available storage space is definitely not enjoyable, at all!

In my opinion it is unthinkable that the scrap box and ammo box, are locked behind a paywall reserved exclusively for the owners of a paid subscription. For us “commoners” that do not want (or cannot afford) the subscription everything we collect goes in our stashbox, which may contain categories in there but most players of open world survival games (that like me came here directly from Fallout 4 and Skyrim), are accustomed in keeping their items categorized in few separate containers not in just one. I guess in this game some simple QoL amenities cannot be taken as granted.

[b]III.[/b]	Third and not least you may ignore the grind, the walking simulator quests and the absurd in-game price system where the NPC vendors seem to blatantly steal your caps worth of the items you trade, but you can definitely not ignore the fact that some main quests are plagued by game breaking bugs that do not allow you to complete them. Few personal examples are the “IAM Become Death” quest where the nuclear code pieces don’t work as well as the infamous “Ol’ Weston Shuffle” quest that bars you from following the Raiders quest-line. 


Summing up, I joined this game with high hopes and expectations that the previous series had cultivated and so I expected to find something, at the very least, amazing. The developers have shown us with their work that when they want they can truly perform miracles creating epic open world RPGs. Unfortunately apart from a distant reminiscence of Fallout 4 what I found in 76 was a game rife with micro-transactions, constantly strangled by self imposed limits, basic content that was barred with paywalls, game breaking bugs that still haven’t been fixed and so my authentic survival game experience was totally disrupted.

[u] Right now you pay good money for a game in which you have to pay again, each month (Subscription), to gain access to some fundamental amenities and then you may have to pay again (Atoms) in order to further purchase any desired cosmetics, utilities and content.[/u]

[b]For all those reasons I cannot recommend this game to any fellow gamers.[/b] | en comparacion de cuando salió, es un juego totalmente diferente y disfrutable, ni tengo amigos para jugarlo y de por si es entretenido | На мой взгляд интересная игра, которая затягивает своими возможностями.

一路玩下來真的覺得進步很大，期待該開放商製作的下一款遊戲。 | This game is silly nonsense at its best and I love it. my little boy and I have been playing at the same time - he does the shooting, I do the running and jumping. We play on easy, it has been great! | чиловая игра сделанная под мультиплеер.
Поиграть с кем то под пивас пойдёт, отсылок на Одноглаза прилично, так же пркольное количество оружек.
Из минусов отмечу лиь два:
1) каким боком гвардейци, камисары размером с орка, а космодесант итого выше если орки в лоре прямо огромные и космодесантник лишь в броне равен им по росту?
2) оптимизация, игра оочень багованная и часто вылетает, трупы начинает колбасить а по всей карте летют ошмётки крови, то что я пару рас проваливался под карту или сквиги застревали в стенах.
В принципе игру советовать могу но повтарюсь игра заточена под мультиплеер и в соло вас довольно часто будут убивать и на нормальной сложности, то как я на максимальной проходил я промолчу | This game is so much fun.

其次在上强度之后，游戏会从模拟建设瞬间转化成微操资源管理，人力和资源的极致运用才能让你拿下胜利，你说肉鸽？什么肉鸽？哪有肉鸽？建设？哪有建设？

这不算充足的随机性除了能让你升血压并不能让你的体验得到提升，毕竟这个游戏所有的肉鸽收益基本都是有滞后性的，鲜少有立即生效却对你收益巨大的情况出现，游戏本身也是比起解决问题更倾向于让问题防患于未然，可以说基本都处于一种今日受苦而明日享福的循环，而人往往并不待见延迟满足，这也是城市建造类游戏的通病，随机性则让这一点被增幅了许多，毕竟脸黑一下的话你的精心布局很可能要到游戏尾声才得以找到key牌启动。

在真正上手游戏的中后期，本作特色的“肉鸽”“建设”属性可以说是基本等于没有（甚至肉鸽方面可能是负作用？），冲着这两点来的颇有几分受骗的味道。高强度下的资源匮乏和时间赛跑让游戏的建设属性约等于无，时间全花在拼尽全力管理有效利用资源上，而肉鸽属性正反馈不足，且低难度通解太多、高难度拿不到最优解血压又太高，负反馈很强导致肉鸽的设计很抽象。

相对的，游戏耐玩、结构与内容完整，微创新也不少，上手简单易懂，游戏内有明确的阶段性目标，能让城建玩的少的玩家不至于迷失方向不知道该做什么，每一局的目标不一样一定程度上保持了新鲜感都是值得肯定的优点。

总的来说是值得一个好评的，入手推荐史低，另DLC风评远不如本体，慎入。 | Against the Storm focuses on the best part of a city builder which is the first hours when you are in the building phase.  Against the Storm plays out differently every time because the buildings you start with are always different.   It is a well optimized game, with constant choices of risk vs reward, and enjoyable when you figure out work-arounds for meeting necessary resources, through supply chain management.

What I appreciate about Against the Storm is that there is never is a point where it gets too complicated with too much too deal with at one time.  The equivalent of the ""Boss battle"" is challenging and rewarding.  Graphic and sound design are excellent.

I've played over 650 hours and still not sick of it, so there must be something to this video game.  

Support these devs.  Eremite Games is a Polish developer consisting of six, and they really have created a real gem of a game, and they have been actively improving and polishing the game for more than a year after the day 1 release. | Let me preface this by saying that the game is very well made and I understand why so many people love it. I am not refunding it for any notable flaws.

For me specifically, when I play this type of game I want to dig in and work on one continuous settlement and make it grow over time, eventually getting to a point where I have this massive city that basically runs itself, giving me a primal sense of satisfaction that doesn't need to be felt again for roughly two years. But this game is a rogue-lite with some aspects of a mobile game, where you constantly restart a 'run', so to speak, unlocking stuff to make things more interesting for the next one. And though well-crafted, it's just not the kind of thing I'm looking for in a city-builder. | I genuinely started off liking Against the Storm, but the further you get into the difficulties the more tedious it gets, with additional negative modifiers and additional hoops to jump through to complete the session. Each seal completion really incentivizes you to play the next difficulty to get enough shards to complete the next seal to follow the metaplot, and lower difficulties may not get you the number of seals you need in time - additionally, the further out you go, the higher the minimum difficulty of the embarkment is, pushing the player to embark on those higher difficulty options. Why progress the seals other than metaplot? So you get more resources for the Citadel metaprogression. Which does things like add resources to your starting caravan so you can actually build some production buildings at the start, or adding a production building that let you make many key items - poorly, at high cost, but beneficial for the build chains so you are not fully reliant on RNG to get a building to complete the chain, or even adding bonuses to each race in your settlement like showing you where the first set of fields is where you can build a farm the first time you recruit a Human, so you don't have to spend half the session opening the wrong glades and never getting the constant food production that would provide. 

Except like many modern roguelite hybrids, this metaprogression is poorly balanced, and time consuming, which makes it feel like busywork rather than enjoyable on its own. It makes the higher difficulties less tedious to tackle (especially with some of the more helpful bonuses), but it just feels like an absolute chore to get through. Speaking of chores, they just add more chores without opening meaningful doors and mechanics past Veteran in terms of the difficulty options. The first three difficulties add mechanics each jump - after Veteran comes Viceroy, which is the same thing as Veteran with new forbidden and dangerous glade events to threaten your settlement and that the forest is more hostile by a multiplier of x3 instead of x2, but they don't do anything ""new"" really, they are just more of what you have seen before on earlier difficulties, and they just cost a ton of resources that you may not have been able to produce unless you have enough bonuses from the metaprogression tree and otherwise they apply so many negative benefits your game may actually end, such as the Stormbird which as far as I can tell by searching across the internet, people have been complaining is poorly balanced even with a good settlement for years. I don't just mean negatively either - the Stormbird applies an infinite storm effect, locking you to a year until you finish it (which you could delay), which is abusable in its own right if you were lucky enough to find it early. The Stormbird is just absurdly out of band in both directions and I cannot understand the intent of including it compared to every other event. I suppose that its very existence changes the logic pattern of whether you should open forbidden glades at all, but the higher difficulties disincentivize the opening of small glades due to hostility modifiers, so that just leaves dangerous glades if you do not want to starve but want to ensure a manageable event. What a forcible winnowing of the meta - it creates a very rote playstyle even though the apparent point of RNG building choice to create more unstable, dynamic push-and-pull gameplay. 

By the way, the tree also has a level attached - as you go through various sessions you get XP, when you level up you unlock new buildings and cornerstones (buffs) to show up in the game. THIS metaprogression mechanic is where the actual doors are opened for new build orders. Except its just as slow as the tree since its a blocker on the tree - without those later buildings and cornerstones, the game is not necessarily giving you the tools to win on higher difficulties. The amount of XP seems really low as well no matter the difficulty and even with completing various achievement challenges, which just exacerbates the issue.

I assume the decision not to bind those buildings and cornerstones to the higher difficulties and instead to a metaprogression level was so that you can use them on the lower difficulties and practice various build chains, but without overwhelming people when they start to play, and because of the complexity of creating a system that could both leave them default on the higher difficulties and then unlock them for use on the lower one once you cleared the higher one. Though perhaps they could have used their training missions for this. In all honesty the buildings beyond the first few levels matter less than the cornerstones, but they both add to how obnoxious the metaprogression system is - even if it is justified ludonarratively. 

In positives, I genuinely like the give and take between blight and production starting with the Veteran difficulty. I enjoy the season model and how each session naturally pushes you to modify your build chain on the fly or attempt to produce enough of your current resources to trade for the things you need to complete the Orders. I enjoy the fact that a session can take no more than one hour or maybe two at the higher speeds and therefore allows a bite-sized city building experience. I genuinely did get 30 hours out of it so I would say I got my money's worth, and I may play some more now and again, but anything that sufficiently annoys me more than it captivates me gets a negative review especially when the causes will not be immediately apparent to the player. | 与其说是城市营造或者基地建设，更像是有限资源管理游戏，不符合我的兴趣"

Server are offline way to often now (maybe permanent soon?) | Classical RTS.

The game is visually nice. The mechs are cool and that is probably why we all buy it.
The tutorial was surprising, limited, yet interesting.
The main concern is, I am not so sure units always does what ordered. They shoot targets for sure, but not necessarily the ones selected. Or it is not clear. Or some becomes mad and stop responding properly. Something is strange here.
There is a pause in campaign mode and it is appreciable. This is not told during the tutorial. Check the keys mapping in the settings to find it.
It copies the classics of the genre. It use the heroes mechanic that was once found in the Warcraft series. However, the resemblance becomes really clear from the third map only. The mission in which you are starting to build.

=====
Edit
=====
I confirm the game in campaign mode at least is not bug free at all.

Characters, especially heroes, may stop responding properly and just go anywhere they want. Sometimes for long. Giving any other order is not changing anything.

One mission, the hero is supposed to die. If you survive the waves of enemies, you may be good to check some forums to find what to do next to progress.

Other mission, an infiltration one just after the hero that must die, some enemy soldiers get stuck. Making impossible any progress without reloading a save.

The quick load comes with a confirmation and a check box supposed to permit to not confirm next quick load. And next times, the dialog will appear with the box checked. Uncheck/recheck did not change anything. | Love the game, but I have issues with AMD GPU. I would invest more time into the game if I didn't encounter so many issues. | Iron Harvest is an ambitious game. That's the best way to sum it up. It has a cool concept—dieselpunk mechs in an alternate history WWI world—but unfortunately, it doesn’t live up to the hype.

The unit cap is absurdly limiting. You’ve got 60 points to work with, but mechs eat up 4-8 points each. This leaves almost no room to build a varied army, especially when you’re supposed to be leading large-scale battles. It’s hard to strategize when your army’s just a handful of mechs with very little room for infantry or other units.

The movement and pathfinding is where things really start to fall apart. Mechs are slow—really slow—especially when turning. They get stuck on terrain all the time, which makes controlling them frustrating. This wouldn’t be so bad if the rest of the controls were tight, but unfortunately, they aren’t. The retreat mechanic, which could be a tactical advantage, doesn’t help either. When you tell units to retreat, they just wander slowly toward the nearest healing station at a walking pace. This basically guarantees they’ll get wiped out before they can make it to safety.

Resource management is about as shallow as it gets. You only manage iron and oil, which gives you very little to work with in terms of building a solid economy or having to plan ahead. It feels like the game is just focused on combat, but it’s hard to enjoy the battles when the mechanics themselves are broken. The factions aren’t balanced either. Infantry units are nearly identical except for basic weapons, and the AI just cheats by spawning units without using resources. This makes it harder to take the game seriously when the opposition isn’t even playing by the same rules.

The technical side of things is also a mess. The game is 30GB of space and still struggles to run smoothly. There are constant bugs, crashes, and performance issues that make it hard to get through a session without frustration. Multiplayer is practically nonexistent, and the developers seem to have abandoned the game—there’s no sign of any meaningful updates or fixes. This is especially frustrating considering the steep price tag, especially when you realize the game’s been left to rot.

Iron Harvest had so much potential, but the execution just doesn’t cut it. The dieselpunk art design is great, but that’s about the only thing this game has going for it. If you’re really curious, maybe wait for a steep discount, but even then, don’t expect anything more than a frustrating experience with some cool art. | Nota: 8/10

I like that every faction leader plays differently as some of them can make units move after attack, rush production, or even have a big canon to defend their city. While the game has all of this going for it, some technologies like engineers are a staple since expanding your territory with multiple towns is very good for your resource pool, so it has a nice balance between picking common strategies and then incorporating your base on the map.

The final war in the last few turns is exciting and makes me nervous, all players and AI pick from 3 sides and then go on an all-out war. Two sides get colossal titans, making the battlefield intense as you look to protect allies while dispatching enemies. I found high-end units to be super fun, particularly human aircraft is a blast to see the planes moving around the map at high speed, ignoring terrain and I love the skill ""evasive maneuvers"" that they have. One can make their army a combination of units but usually specializing pays more, I found that Humans and Cyber feel strong but Voice (the Eldritch Horrors) felt extremely weak in comparison. Hoping the new DLC Voice leader fixes this with some new units and perks.

The game can get stale fast if you play by yourself, but with friends is a lot of fun and remains fresh. I had 15 hours because it is hard to get the whole gang together, but we did 3 matches, and every time it felt good, wasn't a chore or boorish, it was fun to do alliances, and wars and try to win the race of developing faster than everyone else. Graphically it looks nice, the voice acting is good and the music is nice but sometimes there are periods of silence which is a bit of a bummer. The early to mid-game is the best, you gotta analyze your starting point carefully to be successful and outpost contention is thrilling, The Late game can be a bit tedious at times, but only for a little bit at the point where you are between researching and getting the high units. Once you have the units, the late game is a blast!

I recommend the game to people who like Warhammer Gladius or those wanted to try a 4X strategy game for the first time. Beginner friendly and once you get the hang of it after your first match, all that remains is optimizing moves and adapting to situations. In my group the game has been a massive hit, we always speak fondly of it and are excited to play more matches.

[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43679955/][quote]If you enjoyed the review, please follow my curator! [b]StarsDeck[/b]. | ZEPHON's biggest strength for me is its vibe and aesthetics, especially the Voice (aka alien/eldritch horror) side. It's a post-apocalyptic world, but not a typical ""after a huge intra-human war"" settings - instead it's an alien invasion gone horribly wrong for everyone involved, including said aliens. The units' voice acting (even if the lines can be a little repetitive at times) also reinforce this, especially in the early game where your tiny and weak units are trying to survive against the various forms of new and terrifying wildlife. The game dispenses some of its lore at the end of a game depending on your actions as well as in technology and unit descriptions, not unlike a FromSoft game which is very unusual for the genre and an interesting decision.

The diplomacy system is surprisingly well-developped especially coming from the developpers of Gladius (where it's non-existant on purpose). Not only can you sign various treaties with the other players, but you can also tell them to sign one with a given player, or ask them to break their existing treaties. This lets you create a ""bloc"" of alliances to tackle the endgame together, but also means that an AI that hates you and is allied with one of your allies can also try to break your alliance and isolate you. Speaking of the AI, it's not mind-blowing but it's decent and can actually play the game much better than in Civ or Endless Legend. When it declares war on you (at least on higher difficulty levels), you can expect an actual attack with focus and intent. It's not uncommon to see AI players wiping each other out, unlike most other games where even conquering one city can be a tough ask for the AI.

Overall it's a great and refreshing 4X game that I hope will see some more updates in the future without becoming as bloated as Gladius.

Completionists beware however, as there's an achievement that would easily take 1000 hours if done legitimately, and even the cheese method requires letting the game play itself in a very specific way for a few hours. | i played this because i played  Warhammer 40,000: Gladius before, which is a game I greatly enjoyed. 
TBH I am deeply disappointed with Zephon. You play as different classes but all pretty much have the same tech tree. There is no real fun in the way of ""ok now I will play as this one..."" they are all the same. I am now currently playing  Warhammer 40,000: Gladius again and the difference between each faction is massive in comparison. This Zephon game always ends the same where there is some kind of huge face off between the Zephon clan and the Acrin involving massive colossal units entering the battlefield and if you have advanced enough these are not hard to take down alongside allied forces. It is just so boring after a couple of playthroughs, unlike Warhammer 40,000: Gladius which is far superior in terms of 'lets play again as a different faction!' The emphasis being on the word different. | Great turn based combat with Unique units and factions. Coming from Gladius I was instantly hooked by the lore and QOL changes. | Zephon Review – A Game with Immense Potential

Zephon is a game that truly feels like it's on the verge of greatness. From the moment you dive in, its immersive atmosphere, stunning visuals, and hauntingly well-crafted sound design pull you deep into its world. The attention to detail is evident, especially in how in-depth the descriptions are when hovering over various stats—something strategy enthusiasts will definitely appreciate.

Pros:
✅ Incredible atmosphere & setting – The world of Zephon is rich and immersive.
✅ Top-tier graphics & sound – Visually and audibly, it’s a feast.
✅ Deep stat explanations – Great for players who love micromanagement.

Cons & Areas for Improvement:
❌ Research bottleneck at Tier 9 – If you set required research per tier to 5+ items, you can’t progress to Tier 10 due to not having enough tier researched because you can only research 4 techs in tier 9.
❌ Diplomacy is a bit too linear – It works, but it could offer more meaningful choices.
❌ AI needs serious improvement – Even on Hard with a large map, the AI lagged far behind in military tactics, resources, and overall challenge. I was steamrolling everything, which led me to quit out of sheer lack of resistance. If Ultra Hard simply buffs units and cities without improving AI behavior, it won’t fix the core issue.
❌ Unit variety could use a boost – While not a huge deal, more faction diversity would add more depth.

Final Thoughts:
Zephon is fun and has all the makings of a classic, but right now, the experience feels incomplete due to the AI, diplomacy, and research bottleneck issues. I’ll be keeping an eye on updates, but for now, I’m stepping away. That said, with the right tweaks, this could become something truly special.

Looking forward to what’s next! 🔥"
76561197999482693,1488200,Symphony of War: The Nephilim Saga,13.15,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",7,"Oof. I really wanted to love this game, but what a let down. The gorgeous 2D combat screenshots hooked me right away, and with an Overwhelmingly Positive rating by the community, my expectations were high. Unfortunately, after 77 hours of play, Symphony of War: The Nephilim Saga landed at a measly 6/10 for me.

At its core, this is a tactical RPG that feels like a mix of Brigandine (PS1) and The Last Remnant, blending large-scale army management with squad-based combat. You command an army composed of up to 35 (or 40?) squads, each led by a captain with up to nine units ranging from tanks, melee fighters, archers, mages, healers, gunners, cannons, cavalry, and even dragons. Squad composition determines mobility, whether it’s slow infantry, swift cavalry, or airborne units.

Combat plays out on a huge, grid-based map, where you control squad movement. However, once battle starts, you lose direct control over individual units. They attack, heal, crit, and occasionally get extra turns on their own. I love that about it - the randomness of units you handpicked playing themselves in battle. Between battles, you’ll level up units, choose branching advanced classes (fire/ice/lightning mages, paladins, valkyries, rogues, etc.), and unlock army-wide traits that boost different aspects like mage damage, dragon deployment costs, battle income, etc. etc.

SO... WHAT WENT WRONG? 

Well, on paper, this game should have been perfect for me. But a few mechanics ruined the experience.

1. The Squad Composition Problem

One of the strongest traits in the game grants a damage bonus for having mixed unit types in a squad—and it’s so powerful that not using it feels like a handicap. This forces you to build squads based on variety rather than theme.

I wanted to create a gunner squad with tanks in the front and a healer in the back. Or an all-rogue squad for fast, hit-and-run tactics. Or a red dragon squad with red mages supporting them. Instead, the optimal strategy became a hodgepodge of different unit types—tanks, melee, healers, and ranged all thrown together just to activate that bonus. Sure, you can still build thematic squads, but you’ll be at a noticeable disadvantage for doing so.

2. No Real Specialization – You Get Everything Eventually

A big part of tactical RPGs is specialization—choosing upgrades, traits, and strategies that shape your army’s identity. Symphony of War completely removes that tension because you can unlock every single trait in a single playthrough. Instead of having to make meaningful choices and craft a specialized force, you eventually just get everything.

To make matters worse, individual units can learn so many perks that every squad ends up feeling maxed out and overpowered, reducing strategic depth. There’s no real sacrifice or trade-off—everyone just gets everything, which makes customization feel shallow.

3. The Cringey Dialogue & Bland Characters

The writing… oh lawd. It’s painful. Dialogue is filled with clichés, forced drama or romance, and awkward exchanges that made me roll my eyes so hard I saw the back of my own skull. None of the characters stood out or felt compelling. The story itself is fine, but the way it’s told feels like getting force-fed exposition with a shovel. Honestly, the game would have been better if they just deleted all the dialogue. And those massive character portraits... Why do they look like they wandered in from a completely different game? If they were removed, I wouldn’t miss them.

4. Clunky UI & Management System

The clunky UI made unit management phase an absolute chore. There’s way too much clicking, especially with equipping and unequipping gear. Navigating menus is tedious, making army management feel frustrating rather than fun and engaging.

THE REDEEMING QUALITIES:

Despite my complaints, there are things Symphony of War: The Nephilim Saga does really well:

+ Beautiful pixel art—both in battle and on the overworld map.
+ Fantastic sound design & effects—attacks and magic feel satisfying.
+ Solid music—fits the tactical RPG vibe.
+ Tons of equipment variety—there’s a lot to experiment with.

FINAL THOUGHTS:

Even though this game frustrated me, I’m still marking it as “Recommended.” Why? Because I want to see more pixel-art tactical RPGs in the vein of Brigandine and The Last Remnant. Those games were fantastic, and I’d love for this genre to make a comeback on Steam. If you can tolerate the issues I mentioned, you might enjoy it a lot more than I did. In fact, many, many other folks already do (and I think that's great for them).

But for me? It’s a reluctant thumbs-up :/ | 越往后越没意思，剧情实在一言难尽，主角身为圣子依靠惊世智慧，运筹帷幄，带领全国一半有生力量和众多知名英雄人物一口气全军覆没，自己也被处决。圣父多纳尔都绷不住了，只能借尸还魂，直接上号靠圣灵之力作弊代打，开启龙傲天之路，无语了。另外永久死亡模式居然，剧情人物不给死，小兵的命也是命啊，瞬间感觉没啥挑战性了。游戏性尚可吧，但小兵属性随机的设定不太行，尤其自己练的小兵不仅亏属性、吃资源，属性还没有雇佣兵强，就很难接受。
通关后更加感觉游戏很潦草，汉化一坨还不完全，剧情一坨还有快乐的、欠缺自由的、突兀的、任意搭配的恋爱线。游戏全程战斗力靠数值，兵种克制就是说笑，兵种攻击机制差异化很小，全靠神器道具撑属性，骑兵移动力和步兵差别不大，二次移动基本就是换个地方挨打。 | Great game, I have gotten many hours of enjoyment out of it. Looking forward to seeing more from these devs in the future. | 剧情一坨，战斗优异。 | Do you remember those old cumbersome tactical RPG's from the 80's? Miracle Warriors, Shinning Force, Ultima, FF1 and then came the Golden Age with the 90's RPG's and all their anime graphics, massive swords and whacky hairy styles, uniforms, weird as story lines? Well if you do, ""Symphony of War"" will take you down memory lane and if you don't, you then need to jump on the bandwagon and take a trip back in time when RPG's were exciting and different to what they are today.

The game oozes tons of fun, fantastic art, amazing music and a cheesy corny story line that you thank God you can skip and head straight onto focusing on your units and winning the game, or you can sit back and be entertained if that's your thing to.

There's alot of things wrong with this game especially with the interface, and the menu, omg it is absolutely horrendous but that's what it was like playing these games back in the day, tons of useless clicking!

Symphony of War is absolutely brilliant, if you can stop comparing it to today's RPG's and similar games like Fire Emblem, you will find a RPG that ooze's playability with tons of content and fun, the strategy, depth, the vast amount of unit's progression is unmatched, I honestly cannot recommend it enough and it is so amazing to relive this genre as how they were meant to be and use to be."

Leider wurde das Herzstück des Spiels, die Flotten/Mechkämpfe meiner Meinung nach versaut. Scheinbar ist Alles so stark vom Zufall abhängig, dass per Design eine straflose Wiederholungsfunktion des gesamten Kampfes eingeführt wurde. Und die ist auch nötig. Die generellen Trefferchancen sind zwischen 30 und 60 % und bieten massig Raum, das eine Runde ungeplant gut oder ungeplant schlecht laufen kann. Das macht es mitunter herausfordernd solide zu spielen und keine Einheiten zu verlieren. Der harte Spaßkiller ist allerdings der Mapspawn und das Unterstützungsspawnen von zusätzlichen Flotten. Leider ist auch nicht vorhersehbar, wann und wo Unterstützungsflotten eintreffen werden. Es kommt also öfter mal vor, dass eine gesamte gegnerische Flotte in die eigenen Reihen hineingeportet wird und erstmal fürstlich ihren ersten Zug genießt. | This will be one of my more lengthy reviews for a game I absolutely adore but at times can grow extremely frustrated with. It takes all the good things about the first game and polishes it finely. I will say I miss the fire emblem like cinematics but I also like the simple yet colorful animations that replaced them. This game is not for those who want something quick and easy. This game requires a lot of tactics, attention to the big and small details, heavy management of resources, units and planets. I find it extremely rewarding once you know what you're doing and get a better idea of each factions strengths and weaknesses. Start small with a faction that has allies, pay close attention to who is fighting who, make allies, invest in your defenses, keep a fleet or two back to protect your planets, pay attention to enemy flight paths to anticipate incoming attacks. My personal opinion, the game has so much content and so many things to manage that at first it can be extremely overwhleming but once you get the hang of it you will truly enjoy the game. I can't tell you how many campaigns I started only to be wiped out a few turns in. Now I can start a campaign and coast along crushing all who oppose me.

The more you play the more you unlock customization options, then you can eventually create your own overpowered custom commander who will pilot your favorite command unit and be pivotal when starting campaigns that you are at a disadvantage.

I purchased this game at full price and fully support the games Han creates. They always scratch this itch I have for a hard yet rewarding game where your decisions truly matter. This game offers equivalent to what Fire Emblem Three Houses offers in terms of customization, replay value, strategy, management, reward system and cool things that happen when you pay attention to all the details.

To sum it all up; this game is a good option for those who are willing to pour time into it, fight hard and pick yourself up when you're knocked down, pick up and play a lil bit each day where you can savor your wins and learn from your mess ups. The alien campaign literally took me a year to complete just because the difficulty but boy was it worth it to get the achievement in my book. Give it a go if you're big on strategy games and like a challenge."
76561197999482693,1578650,Citizen Sleeper,8.416666666666666,"Adventure, Indie, RPG",21,"A very addictive RPG visual novel set in a sci-fi/cyberpunk future.

You play as a sleeper, an emulated consciousness uploaded into a synthetic robotic body. A victim of corporate propaganda, you signed a contract of servitude, selling your real body away for the promise of a life off-world. But after losing faith in this promised future, you escaped with others from your indentured servitude. Being the only one to make it out alive, caught between a stolen past and an uncertain future, you find yourself on a decaying space station where you must evade the hunters after you and survive, all while trying to buy or synthesize the stabilizer you need to postpone your planned obsolescence.

I found the writing excellent and became completely engrossed by the different life stories of the station's inhabitants. It was easy to get attached to the various characters living on the station.
I also really liked the game's characters design, which reminded me of Katsuhiro Otomo's art style.
And the electronic music was a perfect fit for conveying the atmosphere of isolation and desperation on the station in the game's dystopian world.

Gameplaywise, I didnt find the game particularly difficult. After getting the hang of the mechanics, completing tasks and progressing through the game was fairly easy. Failure was ok as the game was quite forgiving. In my single playthrough, I only missed three achievements. The game has many endings, but you can continue playing by pressing [continue] after the end credits. To experience more endings, always choose the option to leave the station first, when given a choice.
It also didnt seem like the type of sleeper you started with really mattered. I finished the game with 4 out of my 5 sleeper skills fully upgraded.

The game's main strength lies in its fantastic writing and storytelling. So, if you enjoy great sci-fi/cyberpunk stories, you should definitely play this. | Impossible vibes. It's like if the comforting isolation of falling asleep to a white noise generator was a RPG. Incredible game and a very cool interpretation of a distant sci-fi/ cyberpunk future. | This game has some of the most beautiful stories and characters I've seen in a video game, or even some novels I've read. Over the years, you just don't find things like this. I'm a war hardened, grown man, and some of the story threads in this cut me deep. Thank you for this experience. | Citizen Sleeper is an OK game. In this glorified VN you play as a rogue ""Sleeper"" (hey, that's half the name of the game!) a robot with the brain of someone in cryostasis trying to escape the clutches of the evil corporation that employed you. Citizen Sleeper utilizes its cyberpunk influence to make a very compelling college brochure / kinetic novel, but not necessarily an interesting game.
To not be entirely dour on the game I'll conceit, I played the game, I got 3 of the 6 endings, and I only fell asleep twice. The core slash only gameplay mechanic of knowing what your dice rolls will be before you have a skill check is pretty nifty, and lets you choose to prioritize succeeding at the things you want to succeed at and fail at things you don't really care about. The game actually has an interesting cyberpunk setting and world its built, as opposed to the usual ""future city but neon and bad"" sloppa you usually get. The game can be finished in one or 2 short sittings. The look of the game is fairly iconic and inspired, and while you might not like the vaguely zog adjacent character designs, it is its own style and you're not going to see other games of the similar setting even remotely attempt this ambition, especially with its small 3 man team, even larger in breadth of scope and intention of design, so you have to admire the sheer passion and care involved.
And we've come to the part where I become a big fat meanie, so if you read that and are like ""wow, hey wait, [i]I[/i] like words and pictures! I'm going to buy this now!"" please, be my guest, its not bad.




[i]However[/i],,,
Citizen sleeper is not a game!!!! It's a VN with extra clicking!!!! The writing is one note, every character speaks in the same voice and I can't tell you anything a character said beyond aphorisms, cliches, occasional vague left footed marxist toe steps, and brief fellations towards the unnamed player character. A former soldier tells you his adopted daughter ""saved him, actually"", another tells you that you just don't get it do you, and my personal favourite, when you help a bounty hunter kill a man and she pays you, you drop the money on the ground and say ""what life is worth this"". I promise you, that you can google every cliche movie line and I guarantee its somewhere in this game spoken by the widely diverse cast of characters. That dice thing I talked about earlier becomes negligible past the first or second hour as once you've gained a couple levels, you can acquire the ability to reroll at any point during a turn, even when you only have one die left. Naturally, I abused this to get the main ending i wanted out of the game, because why not. In general though, levelling up trivializes the game, your first level, if you so choose can be spent to negate any weaknesses your character class had, you CAN add plus 2 bonuses to your rolls but by the end i was rolling too many 5's and 6's to even think of that as an investment. There's a skill to regain health and stamina for free, but you get so much money for every little thing you do you have to go OUT OF YOUR WAY TO FAIL AT ANYTHING. The game constantly terges and teases impending doom and choices mattering, however, I realized early on you don't actually have any agency in the solipsistic monologues the characters speak to you, so I said the meanest dialogue option I could, every time, and, every time, they would just ignore me and keep monologuing about the world. Speaking of doom, I'll let you know now, if you run out of health? You get put back to half health at the cost of one of your buffs/debuffs, if you run out of time on your bounty hunter missions? You get the same cutscenes as you would if you were a good boy. You are simply watching the story unfold from the eyes of another, the room starts spinning and I begin experiencing extreme depersonalization, is this how it is in the game? or is this every day for me? Do I truly want the life I lead? Do I have the choice to not want it after all? These are the questions I ask myself as I click through dialogues, rush through sidequests for my favourite characters, then distributing my worst rolls in a pyramidial manner to characters I like slightly less and so on so forth.


In the world of Disco Sleeper, there's a heavy dearth over the whole universe that capitalism has made things as awful as they are, and I don't mind me a good rage against the machine, hey, I rage against the machine myself too sometimes,

[i]However[/i], 
I do have a problem when its so piss easy to progress in whatever way you want it makes the evil society look ideal. Like in the world of citizen sleeper, you save every minute so you can walk away whenever you want, and there's no consequences for doing absolutely nothing to help yourself. And even moreso everyone is so nice to eachother there's no danger in the world at all. People in mortal bitter rivalries talk out their problems, people steal and get stolen from with no desire for reprisal. The one character that does anything remotely morally questionable immediately renounces her 'evil' (she was in the right btw) ways and decides to abandon her current life for that similar to one of a nun. So its not just the player that all this is just insanely easy for. This world is awesome to live in, this awful world is better to live in than my actual real awful world. If this is the world that the evil capitalists built for the people of Erlin's Eye, sign me up. Sign me up for 2 even, so I can wreck one.

And despite all this, the game was alright. There IS an interesting world and ideas behind all the genera and eye-rolling, I'd buy it on a sale or something if you're willing to live with the big howevers mentioned above.

If you're looking for a similar idea of what you're getting into I'd liken this game to Va1ha11a cyberpunk bartending, where there's an incredibly shallow gameplay mechanic and an incredibly shallow story and they're both smushed together so you don't really realize why neither portion are as good or fleshed out as they could be. | I enjoyed this one quite a bit. More of a visual novel than a typical game.

Pretty good writing but not mind-blowing. The gameplay mechanics are under-developed, especially towards the end they become a bit of a chore. 

But! The story, characters and situations as a whole make up for the flaws. This a very immersive and emotional experience, it really manages to transport you into its world. So overall it's worthwhile."

one issue to be forewarned about, the Story Mode runs credits after introducing all the characters over a single day, but that's just the beginning of story mode with each character having several levels and scenes where you deepen the friendship. | You beat the main storyline and then you have an option to befriend/romance all the characters. The character design, styles, pronouns, are so diverse that its so refreshing to see a game like this now a days. My only complaint would be that 1. its a very short game. 2. The voice acting is wonderful but there are times where the music overshadows the voices. Other than that its nearly perfect. The actual combat of the game, the puzzles are so refreshing as well and are VERY disability friendly.

I've never seen these developers before but I really look forward to some of their future stuff and I wish them the absolute best. Ty for creating such a beautiful piece of work. | [h2] [i]I want to like this game.[/i] [/h2]

As far as the gameplay is concerned, everything there is to love about Panel de Pon / Tetris Attack / Puzzle League is here.
The problem, is if you are any good at this style of gameplay, there's nothing new here. All of your garbage (regardless if it's from a combo or chain) turns into panels when the bottom row is cleared. Therefore, the game is even easier. Even worse, this has the terrible side-effect of completely removing the rhythm expert matches in this style of game have. 
The other thing, is that there are high-level mechanics in PdP/TA/PL that are simply [i]not[/i] possible here. Frame-perfect switching to keep a chain going? Forget about it.

The story mode is nice, it's a puzzle game. I'm not expecting anything groundbreaking, it does what it needs to. However, once you've done that and Versus. That's it. That's the game. Puzzle mode? Line clear? Nowhere to be found. Flipon is $4 and has a puzzle mode. Regardless of price point, missing core mainstays of the genre like this is inexcusable.

It kills me to say this but, grab this while it's on sale. There's a fun couple of hours to be had here for sure if you're new to action puzzle games. However, there's not enough content here for experts and the mechanical changes to core gameplay fundementals take what should be an exciting back and forth and turn it into a speedrun of the boring kind. | Let me be clear: I don't recommend this game in its current state. If there are future updates with story developments and gameplay mechanics I would happily recommend it.

As of right now, I downloaded it the day of release and finished the story in 88 minutes. And the story felt primarily like a pro-longed tutorial where I was learning to swap better and faster, and was being introduced to characters. Mind you, I think the characters are neat (personally would've liked some more mlm rep but that's at the bottom of the barrel of issues), and some of them I was really interested in learning more about. I even was developing some theories to how the story would continue as you went forward, and thinking about how I would write them up to see if I got any correct in the long run...

But the long run never happened. The story was less than 10 versus battles against NPCs who you (the player) just meet for the first time and get a TL;DR of their personality and story. Mind you sometimes that's fine...so long as it would be expanded upon at a later point in the story. (For example, we just found out in this story that [spoiler] Kannon was an Angel, despite us (the character) knowing him for quite some time and him literally looking nothing like the rest of the people in the town and having ACTUAL ANGELIC WINGS [/spoiler]. Facts or information that's given to us isn't given any sense to breathe - its all swapping, some light humor, and then back to swapping. 

I wanted to like this game, hell, I wanted to LOVE this game. I have had it on my wishlist since I was told of this during an Indie Developer E3 Conference in like 2022. I was so excited when I got the notification on my phone that this game finally dropped and I would be able to play. I paid, downloaded it, and was so hyped...for nothing.

I guess I can go back and romance a few options right now, but I don't see a need to do that? The story is done, what more will I learn from these people who aren't going to impact the world around us? If the spirits need swapping are still invading the town, then why are we focusing on dating? Why not get a fuller force to get this completed?

Like I said, if there are future updates with story developments and gameplay mechanics I would happily recommend it to anyone who wants some good vibes and good representation. The music is nice and fitting, the gameplay is smooth and not hard to pick up, and the characters can be interesting and fun to interact with. But it feels like the substance to this game right now is very little and I don't have a desire to go back to it until something else or more gets added. | It's Tetris Attack! But also, it's a little bit of a decorate my house game! But also it's a hang out with cool people game! I'm told there might be kissing!

Vibes a great, team did a fantastic job with the character, audio, and match three. Already looking forward to exploring this more."
76561197999482693,1605220,Dune: Spice Wars,7.066666666666666,Strategy,20,"Почему Dune: Spice Wars заработала Shiro Games существенно меньше денег, чем Northgard или хотя бы Wartales?

Думаю, дело в следующем:

1. Сложнее въехать (чем в другие работы Shiro). Надо провести хотя бы часов 5-6. И сходу непонятны не только мелкие нюансы, а целые механики.

2. Это не римейк той самой Dune 2. Нет танков, ракетниц, выдуманных Ордосов и много чего ещё. Так уж получилось, что совершенно неканоническая разработка Westwood для многих игроков является первоисточником.

3. Это не особо похоже на Northgard. Вернее, совсем непохоже.

4. Это не RTS, а стратегия 4X. Может быть не такая навороченная как некоторые представители жанра. Но тут точно не работает никакой раш и типовые для RTS подходы.

А теперь то же самое, но с точки зрения плюсов:

1. Что такое 5-6 часов для 4X? Я в своё время в Civ5 въезжал дольше, а в Stellaris окончательно понял как играть через 30 часов. 5-6 часов - просто идеальное время для понимания стратегии такого типа.

2. Shiro гораздо бережнее поработали с книгами. И эта работа с ограничениями заставила их выверять подходы и особенности до мелочей.

3. Если честно, я Spice Wars полгода боялся запускать. Так как думал, что это рескин Northgard с некоторыми наворотами. Ура, это не он!

4. Кому-то вообще нужна была бы Dune 3000? Серьёзно? Жанр устарел ещё в начале 00-х.

А ещё! Здесь редко бывает больше 10-12 юнитов под контролем - и это заставляет включать голову. Общая медлительность позволяет воевать на 2, а иногда даже на 3 фронта. Есть активная пауза (для соло-игры). Дерево развития выверено до мелочей. Стороны сильно отличаются по фишкам. Графика, стиль и вообще UI в целом - идеал.

Короче, отличная игра. Одна из лучших стратегий, в которые я играл за последнее время. | Interesting to begin with.  The game plateaus very quickly though. Very little replayable value for me.  After a couple of hours it gets tedious.  Boring.  I regret buying this game. | The novel Dune was written during the Cold War, and this game has that aura.

Do not expect a standard RTS. This is a game about statecraft, about cold wars, about the balance of power, about paranoia. Warfare is a continuation of policy by other means- often an inevitable one, but more pursued to deny the enemy victory than to seize it. It's more about medieval-style raids & chevauchées than massive campaigns. The Landsraad and intelligence systems are brilliant. Expect assassinations to be a more common threat than sieges of enemy capitals are.

As an adaptation of the novel within the confines of a Civ-style game, it's excellent. The great dangers of Arrakis, the thirst & the worms, are of both strategic & tactical importance- by which I mean they will destroy your entire army if you slip up. So many of the little details of the world are here as well, down to the Fremen donkeys. The factions from the book are invoked wonderfully in gameplay too- the honor and ""honor"" of the Atreides, the drugged-up thuggery of the Harkonnen troops, the vicious, vampiric fanaticism of the Fremen, the Corrinos lurking aside, playing one House against another until they can throw down a fortress from orbit and seize the planet for themselves. The additional factions are flavorful too.

I'd recommend this game in particular to those who love the book & its cynical philosophy, and to those who like the idea of games like Civ but want something leaner, quicker, & smarter. 

Note that God created the single-player mode to train for the multiplayer mode. This review has assumed that it's the latter you'll be getting the game for. | Feels great. The environment is very dangerous but fair. Politics works, which is impressive for this kind of game. The factions have good differentiation- Harkonnens oppress their people and throw away their own people to feed the machine. Fremen move easily in the desert but they don't get to vote in politics. Atreides can be very effective politcally and can take villages peacefully. And whoever you are, there are the constant pressures of collecting the Spice. | It's too much like the game Civilization and not enough like DUNE 2000.  

It's not a bad game and i can even see how it could have become oddly addicting for many people but for me personally it doesn't really have what i want to satisfy me.  The biggest issue is the lack of strategy involved for how you set up your base/territories.  In fact there is very little actual decision making that goes into your base setup at all.  Instead it's a repetitive process of taking over preexisting villages, then haphazardly placing whatever structures you need around it for that given territory depending on which resources the territory has.  It makes zero strategic difference where you place your buildings because they're never attacked anyway.   It's only the Villages themselves that ever come under threat.. which by the way you defend by repetitively hiring militia for every annex'd village.  In this regard, the game is totally brainless and requires no strategic thinking for how you go about setting up your territories.  In DUNE 2000, for example, there was a very satisfying sense of accomplishment for the way you choose to build your base and design it's defenses.  Spice Wars just doesn't have that.

There is a lot more i could say both negatively and positively about the game but it's mostly the lack of strategy and satisfaction that comes with conquering territories that bothers me."

It is a rogue-lite game, with a pleasing black and white aesthetic. Initially it has a little bit of a learning curve with how hard the enemies are. The more you play, the more you gain a feel for the pace and reaction time of enemies, as they progressively get harder through each ""area"" you clear.

76561197999482693,1286680,Tiny Tina's Wonderlands,3.1666666666666665,"Action, Adventure, RPG",6,"TL;DR I would only recommend this for die-hard Borderlands fans.

The pre-endgame is exceedingly easy despite setting the difficulty to ""Intense"". I never struggled once up until the end game boss. The most difficult parts of earlier games were the burst damage some enemies did that was hard to overcome as a solo. While I am glad they scaled that back in this game, with no other challenge provided the core loop is reduced to holding down M1 until the enemy dies. To top it off, every quest was just ""go here press E, go here shoot this, go here press E"". It was a bit disappointing. 

Now admittedly this wouldn't be so egregious if there was a gripping story or moment-to-moment writing like Borderlands 2 had, but personally this game fell very flat in that regard. I listened to every dialogue line and did every side quest expecting at least some moments with the same charm as the previous games, but I didn't find any. Perhaps I have simply become jaded, but there were no hard-hitting lines nor engaging plot lines. I lightly chuckled twice the entire game. I never cringed or wondered what the writers were smoking as I did with BL3, but the Wonderlands plot was simply bland.

This isn't to say the entire game is horrible. I like much of the balance changes they made, the art style is charming, and the class system is interesting. The legendary drop rate is lowered in this game compared to BL3, which was desperately needed as they felt a dime-a-dozen in that game. This is balanced out by having your loot luck increase as you progress in the game which I felt fit very well. The new gun types, the few that aren't recycled from BL3 that is, are fun to play with and a welcome addition. And I appreciate the take on classes with a respeccable second class, although I think I still prefer the per-character system from the mainline games.

Should also be mentioned the end game is potentially the best in a Borderlands game so far: a set of repeatable trial chambers which tie closely into the ""Chaos Level"" system that increases enemy toughness and unlocks better tiers of gear. I have not completed all the Chaos Levels and won't pretend to have beaten each end game in all BL games, but I would like to say that this feels the most replayable and fair.

Overall a game with fun mechanics that falls entirely flat in the story department. | It's an alright game.

Basic borderlands looter shooter concept, but DnD themed.
Skill trees I feel are less impacting than previous iterations of the game.
You can do a dual class system which I like a lot.
The introduction of companions for most classes is cool, but I feel like they fall pretty short, even when trying to spec into them.
The weapons aren't that much different than other borderlands games. With a difference that you can different melee weapons, and a spell equipped. These are nice twists, and spells can be pretty fun with the variety of options.
The story is kind of dull to be honest. Very heavy in dialogue, which I understand it's a DnD game. But you start to tune out after a while.
The gameplay loop isn't really that exciting. The difficulty is pretty moderate with that you can clear most mobs easily, but then you have to play a little tactfully with others.

Overall I'd say it's worth a heavy discount. Definitely never worth the full asking price.
 | Bisschen lame. Fühlt sich an als würde man kaum etwas sinnvolles tun. Man spielt aber warum? Kein Plan. Ohne meinen Kumpel würde ich mich zu Tode langweilien. Wer krass auf Dnd und Shooter steht ok. Aber wer von der Qualität etwas wie BL3 erwartet wird enttäuscht. | 10/10
Great co-op game for borderlands fans, I'm really happy that they expanded on Tiny Tina's DnD adventure.

However, why are we not releasing any updates at all for this? Not saying to make it a live service game or anything but I'd like to see more content released, or at least an expansion with a raised level cap or something. | 其实我一开始是期待体验会跟无主之地三部曲会有很大不同，结果一进游戏，完了，第一印象就是又回到了那个废土打枪的地方。
但是体验差了很多，因为频繁进出副本打枪，大地图的功能只有赶路，战斗还得额外进副本打，可以说是游戏技术和设计上的巨大退步。"

However, with the added DLCs, it's considerably better.  After that, the mod community has done some exceptional work and added massive amounts of content, quality of life, and performance tweaks that have me seriously hooked.  With all the DLC and the mods, this game is really fun.  

If you want a great preview, check out Baradul on YT.  He's just started another play through as I write this and has a great mods list that just about everyone should enjoy.  I don't care for the heavy smoke and fire effects mod, but check it out anyway, you may dig it.

The Solaris DLC is probably the most flawed of the bunch, but it can be handy to farm decent salvage, C-bills, and weapons early-mid to late game.  In several scenarios, the AI of the mechs in the matches is sketchy at best.  They will just sit still or wander in a tight circle until they spot the player.  Meh.  The campaign for this DLC is funny at least and worth doing.

One bit of warning, enabling all those mods can cause the game load time to crank up to a couple minutes.  Be patient, it's worth the wait.  :) | Recommend with mods. Don't recommend the base game. YAML series of mods make the game worth playing. Along with others. It's the games only redeeming quality, that and the open world mercenary nature of it. Wish a different company would have gotten the license for mechwarrior. | It's a functional game, even pretty fun if you are a fan of the universe, but it has a serious case of needing expansions and mods to really be complete.

It feels like there is a core of good gameplay that is faithful to the setting, but everything else is implemented lazily. Rag dolls don't look right on multi-ton 'mechs, the missions have very procedurally generated feel, even many of the central storyline missions. Also a personal preference, I would prefer a more sim type battles where you go against equal forces most of the time instead of arcadey heroic standoffs where you mow down hordes of enemies. I had to exploit some of the cheesiness inherent of replicating the boardgame in first person style to win some of those fights and didn't love that. I know giant stompy robots aren't realistic, but the setting always pretended it was serious military sci-fi.

Also had to tinker quite a lot to have my preferred controls set up. Luckily someone on Reddit had already done the work and I only had to copy-paste. And I like a bit of tinkering. Reminds me of the old times. Ended up using HOTAM setup. I was also very interested in the VR mod. It is indeed very impressive work but far from perfect. Can't see myself playing the campaign with it. I wish there was native support.

I can't in good conscience recommend this game for an average player. An old Battletech or Mechwarrior fan who's willing to fork more cash for expansions and download a bunch of mods might be an exception. Definitely wait for sales, tho. | Good game, if you can stomach the repetitive missions and the mission design.
By that I mean the enemies are not really difficult to deal with, but they are many... wave after wave can wither you down until you lose expensive/rare components. 

Nevertheless fun for many hours. | Super cool game. I recommend modding the game straight out of the gate and don't even bother with the vanilla game. The rescaling mod is essential. Graphics are OK but with some mods can look great. The game play loop can be repetitive but in this game it works, as you can pick the game up for a few hours but come back anytime you feel like putting in a few more missions. It's kind of like a mech simulator. The fun of the game comes from acquiring new mechs, experimenting with loadouts and upgrading weapons so when you hit the battlefield you feel like a badass. It's built on Unreal engine so there is some unfortunate stutter; for me when enemy lances spawn in and I get the radio message.  The optimisation also leaves a bit to be desired so a fast machine is preferable."

На 3-4 вечера заставляет забыть обо всём и медленно за чашкой чая исследовать загадки, планировать ресурсы на походы и разбираться в механиках квестов. | В игре много багов (очень), однако это ранний доступ и вроде сам решил играть в недодел, но...  Я мог любые баги потерпеть, но концовку с китайскими субтитрами... ктонить расскажет, что там по итогу рассказывали после того как грохнули скорпиона в конце?

Геймплей в начале был интересным, напомнило Curious Expedition, где каждый шаг стоит провизию, посетить каждую клетку невозможно и проходиться взвешенно выбирать. Разные случайные события, решения которые могут зависеть от инвентаря и навыков персонажей, вобщем всё как мы любим.  А примерно на той стадии, когда открываются дороги между городами, игра с каждой минутой начинала становиться проще и скучнее. 

Боёвки странные, в битве с ""равным"" противником только скорость твоих персонажей определяет разницу между ""весь мой караван сбрили за 1 ход"" и ""я сбрил всех противников за 1 ход"".

Ещё путешествие по дорогам не отменяет наличия ""засад"", когда между первым и вторым городом на тебя нападают совсем слабые собаки на 1 полутычок, дольше ждёшь загрузку. Это очень нудно. Загрузку на боёвку можно было сделать мгновенную.

Также с некоторого момента ресурсы собираются тоннами, а рюкзак без улучшений по сюжету уж совсем тонкий. Пока сделаешь основные квесты 90% приходится просто выкидывать, чтобы потом получить нормальное расширение рюкзака, но уже перед концом игры =) ""для сражения с финальным боссом?"". А вообще, если подумать, то ценности ресурсов в игре вообще нет, и весь топовый шмот доступен практически сразу с начала игры. 

И канешн куча непродуманных и сломанных механик, от бесконечного фарма ресурсов на бесплатных дорогах, до читерного хила, который позволяет в некоторых случаях обходиться без провизии - получать урон при передвижении, а при очередной стычке выхиливать отряд на полную и продолжать своё непобедимое и голодное шествие.

В конечном итоге сложилось впечатление, что единственный кто старался над проектом это художник, ведь графика в игре, в отличии от всего остального, действительно красивая."

giant laundry list of issues:
1) Weapon balance makes 0 sense. but that doesn't mater because..
2) Weapons are useless. All you need is a high damage weapon then the time slowdown and autoaim powers can play the game for you. manually shooting at stuff is a mess when you die in a second if you stop moving like a monkey because most enemies are hitscan and you die the millisecond you stop jumping / dashing.
3) Have to execute enemies in melee nonstop to heal while waiting your broken powers to recharge. The animations glitch out more often than they work properly and half of them are over 3 seconds long.
4) Calling the story garbage is like pretending it has one. the story you get to play feels like an over-extended prologue for a real game story.
5) The graphics glitch out especially in the last few missions.
6) Everywhere looks the same. You'll spend the entire time in ugly tunnels, sometimes the game baits you with what looks like a giant city then nope back to the tunnels for you.
7) There is like 5 enemy types and outside the rocket mechs non of them qualify for more than fodders in other games.
8) Your dog is a timed summon that gives you wallhacks; it can jump around why does it need to constantly disappear?
9) The loot barely makes a difference and you will probably benefit more just selling it all to get upgraded biotechs anyway. aside from archeotech (damage boost per bullet) if you want to break the dps limits with a minigun.
10) The gundealer is completely useless, wasn't useful a single time in the entire campaign.
11) The bounties are just dumb random missions in areas you've already played, like running around to kill 10 witches in a 20 meter room while enemies indefinitely spawn.
12) Music bugs out all the time.

 | I am a massive fan of the 40k universe but not so big a fan that it would blind me from how god awful this game is. I started this game up a while back then stopped playing it, I was looking through my unfinished games and wondered why I dropped this one and quickly found out why. Normally I wait until I finish the game to write a review, especially a bad one, but I am close to shelving this game again, it'll take some willpower to push through it, but I'll try.
The main issue I have with the game is what it focuses on which is the combat, it feels like they really wanted to make a Doom-like shooter but all it ended up with is a weak watered down version of Doom with lazy and/or unfinished aspects of the game and a 40k coat of paint. Also they turned the Doom gameplay into a cover shooter for some reason. But the most glaring issue I've seen is the laughable animations, the characters move like first generation console characters. On top of that, the story is uninspired and the soundtrack is lackluster.
All in all there is really just no reason to play this game, no matter how much you like 40k, just save your time and money and stay away from this one.

UPDATE: Just finished the game, and I can confirm, it only gets worse. I would say more but I don't want to waste any more time on this game than I already have. | This plays like a AAA CONSOLE shooter.

Pros:
+ Lots of varied strategies and synergies to choose from
+ Game rewards you for strategic thinking and considering many angles. 
+ Satisfyingly difficult without feeling unfair
Cons:
- The voice acting, lore, and overall visual presentation is bland
- Synergies matter more than individual units in most cases. Your opponent's strategy doesn't matter either.
- Replay value isn't forever since playing the same builds get boring after a while | Great game, very mellow to play casually.

76561197999482693,1741640,Shadows of Forbidden Gods,12.25,"Simulation, Strategy",6,"What a unique game! Very immersive and actually has very rich mechanics that interact with each other, creating cool emergent gameplay as you influence characters in the world and then watch how they turn against each other and the world slowly descends into chaos | It's good.

There are not a lot of games that focus on indirect control as the core mechanic, and SoFG is probably the best one out of all of them. All the things you'd expect to be wrong with a game of this scope to budget ratio are there, from crunky UI to unevenly available information to arcane sub-sub-subsystems that might decide the outcome of your game if you haven't seen them before, to very uneven feel of quality between different playable elder gods...

But then if you're looking at this title, chances are at least some of the opacity, abundant complexity and plentiful soft failure states are actually a draw rather than a drawback for you.

The game has a number of subsystems that interact with each other. Plagues cause death, death can be used to spawn ghasts, which will enshadow the countryside, enshadowed locations corrupt their rulers and heroes with more shadow, at which point they will start ignoring the spreading plague.

However, the game is also full of heroes and rulers who will by default fairly easily undo anything you put into place. The key to winning the game is often two-fold - picking a core strategy early (which means learning enough about what they all are, which will take a while), and running distraction tactics until your core strategy completes.

You have a number of agents and evil god powers that are all able to make the world a little bit worse, but none of them will be enough to win the game on their own. Instead, the game essentially is about building out a self-growing engine of corruption and decay into the game world's independent systems.

Assassinate a ruler? A heir will take his place. Instead, steal a personal belonging of theirs and use it to engineer a scandal in a neighbouring kingdom, making war between them that much more likely.

Drive a local town into madness? The clerics and heroes will soon fix it. Instead, mask and hide the growing abyssal fish-people cult until it begins spilling over into new towns and you can curse entire family bloodlines.

Amass an orcish army and break the human kingdoms into dust? There's more of them and they will destroy you armies once they become notorious enough. Unless of course you have a secondary orcish horde ready to take over the now-abandoned lands of their slain brethren - and those of the razed human kingdoms, too.

Try to remove a ward against shadow a religious movement placed? They will place hundreds more. Instead, manipulate signs of prophecy to place your own minion as their prophet, and slowly turn the religion into one that spreads shadow for you instead.

The game has a stupid amount of options and eventually it makes it really fun to engage with the game, being able to pick from your vast array of tools to sculpt just the outcome you want. Until that happens, you're kind of stuck picking things up to try them out and learning that hey actually they don't do very much on their own at all, and that the process for finding out why they failed or what they even do is pretty obtuse. But, you know. Some days all that feels like a plus. Maybe today's that day for you? | This is a very good strategy game - buy it.  It  could use some better tutorials and the UI is wacky.  However, once  you get a grip on how the game play works, it is a lot of fun to watch the good folk crumble to your long simmering plans.  Also, each of the  evil gods play very differently and this offers a lot of replay.  One thing that could use improvement is the magic /special actions systems where it is way too time consuming to mess with compared to just enshadowing. everything  (with the possible exception of death magic ghosts).  Anyway, this is is worth full price. | This is the roughest game I have ever enjoyed.

As people have warned, the UI is terrible. It does slow the game down, raise the learning curve, and make figuring things out a chore. The nicest thing I can say about how the game looks is that it manages to not clash too much, despite being somewhat cobbled together from limited art-assets and public domain-images. 

But as a grand-strategy game, the game still manages to work, and deliver on it's theme. If you bite down, there is much, much here to chew on, and the planning and strategizing of your moves is very rewarding. The writing and aesthetics could be better, but the game delivers just enough lore and fluff with it's mechanics, for most of the themes to land. 

Everything around the core gameplay in this game could use some work, but what's here is a functional, strong idea in a genre that rarely gets good games. | Если вашей душе захотелось чего-то более нестандартного в плане пошаговых стратегий, то как-то раз я наткнулся на... это.

Прежде отмечу что да, графика тут по сравнению с прочими коллегами по жанру полное днище, даже по весьма непритязательным меркам. Но, мы же в инди не за этим идём, правильно?

А игре есть что предложить, потому что... В двух словах её геймплей уже успели довольно ёмко охарактеризовать в другом обзоре: ""Представьте, что вы играете за Ктулху, в то время как остальной мир вокруг вас играет в Crusaders Kings""

И это действительно так. Только играете вы скорее не за самого Великого Древнего, а за условную группу его приспешников, которые пытаются своего покровителя призвать в дженериковый фэнтезийный мир с людьми, гномами, эльфами и прочими орками.

Начинаете вы одиноким сектантом в капюшоне, который должен пробраться в ближайшую деревеньку и начать там распространять веру в своего темного повелителя. А делать это нужно затем, чтобы потом было проще разносить свой фхтанг уже дальше - в города и столицы королевств, постепенно становясь все более заметным и могущественным. При этом вы медленно распространяете порчу, которая называется здесь ""тенями"" (shadows), нанимаете новых агентов, творите различную магию... Ну а мир вокруг вас до поры до времени просто живёт: кто-то на кого-то нападает, соседи заключают и нарушают договоры, герои - геройствуют.

К слову о последних. Вы же не думаете, что они вас будут все время игнорировать? Рано или поздно ваши козни станут слишком заметны на мировом фоне и здешний Избранный начнет как в заправской RPG собирать под свои знамёна армии и убеждать правителей в том что вы не просто наркоман, балующийся зельями, а опасный культист, стремящийся захватить мир.

Но произойдет это не сразу, потому что, как я уже говорил, пока вам нужно наращивать свою мощь, в том числе за счёт новых агентов. А они бывают двух категорий: стандартные и, скажем так, уникальные. Из первых можно лепить что вам вздумается, а вот вторые обычно имеют собственные портреты и уникальные навыки, недоступные прочим. Тут все как на подбор: падший аристократ, дикарь, безумный шаман племени орков... двенадцать колоритных личностей. Ну и вместо полноценной графики у них тут портреты с закосом под эпоху Возрождения. А ещё вы можете совратить одного из уже существующих героев, чтобы он встал на вашу сторону. Ну или банально свести с ума - одной проблемой меньше, так или иначе.

Всех агентов можно отправлять на различные задания, которые включают в себя как обычную инфильтрацию в сообщество крестьян Малой Кукевки, так и более сложные вещи наподобие изучения магии, исследования вон тех древних руин или сражений с войсками ""нормисов"".

Да, тут есть простенькая боевая система, напоминающая весьма упрощенные Discilples: по ходу игры вы можете нанимать для своих агентов различных бойцов, которые будут защищать их как от назойливых приключенцев, так и солдат местного лорда, которому вы чем-то не угодили. Особых тактических изысков не ждите, игра всё-таки не про это.

А вот кому угождать нужно, так это вашему темному божеству, поскольку нужно успеть захватить мир до того как истечет определенное количество ходов. Ну а ваш покровитель, в свою очередь, предоставляет вам свои, зачастую уникальные способы по достижению своей цели. Непосредственная помощь, как правило, представлена в виде различных заклинаний, которые вы можете использовать на общей карте. Причем, чем больше вы распространяете порчу и чем больше проходит времени, тем сильнее становится божество и под конец его аватар даже может самолично выйти против зарвавшихся смертных.

Впрочем, на вашу долю тоже выпадают определенные события, которые представлены в виде простеньких текстовых квестов. Хоть они и часто повторяются, но вносят свою небольшую лепту в разнообразие геймплея.

И вот таким образом вы постоянно отправляете кого-то на задания, сражаетесь с врагами, изучаете новое заклинание, что приводит к небезызвестному синдрому ""ещё одного хода"", когда оторваться до самого конца партии ну очень сложно.

Ну а для тех, кому захочется добавки существует целое DLC ""The Horrors Beneath"" которое вводит целый дополнительный слой карты - Подземье и связанный с ним контент, включая новое божество, дремлющее в недрах планеты. Впрочем и восьми Древних в оригинальной версии хватит надолго. А ещё игра официально поддерживает моды и там тоже можно найти что-то себе под стать.

Однако, к сожалению, не каждый сможет продраться сквозь перегруженный интерфейс и малоинформативное обучение. Да и перевода у игры тоже нет, к сожалению. Но если у вас получится пройти сквозь все дебри, то поздравляю - вы сможете вдоволь порадовать внутреннего злодея."
76561197999482693,1782120,ZERO Sievert,16.533333333333335,"Action, Adventure, Indie",0,"Disclaimer: I played on the Medium preset difficulty, no perma-death. I made no other changes to the difficulty setting.

I tried really hard to like Zero Sievert (I hope my play time speaks to that sentiment), but the game feels incomplete, resulting in a lot of deaths that felt more like I was unlucky and less like I was being punished for playing carelessly.

A big draw of the extraction shooter genre is the tense, slow-burn moments leading up to a gunfight that can last anywhere from a couple of seconds to actual minutes where it feels like a high-stakes game of cat and mouse. But in order to have those tense moments - especially in a PvE extraction shooter - visual information that's provided to the player needs to be VERY clear in its delivery. First-person style shooters generally have a good way of handling this. If you can't see but can hear the threat, you have a lot of options on how to locate the enemy. You can move from your location; you can look in the direction of the audio; or you can even find a hiding spot with a good sightline and wait for the enemy to show themselves.

Unfortunately, while Zero Sievert does a good job with the audio component, the isometric camera is a huge detriment to the visual component of information gathering. Multiple times in all six of the maps, I was shot at and/or killed by enemies I couldn't see because they were outside of my screen's field of view. In some cases, even if I was scoped in with my rifle, I would've been barely able to see them! Getting killed by an offscreen enemy feels extremely cheap because there's no way for me to have known that I would need to react to that if that critical visual information wasn't provided to me.

Zero Sievert also likes to put a fuck-load of clutter on the map as a way to force navigation to be slow. That in itself is fine. But when an enemy is visually blocked by a broken car or a stack of bricks or even the fucking threshold of one of the stores in the mall, I can't necessarily see from where I'm getting shot at and react quickly, resulting in another death from an enemy I couldn't see. Enemies hiding behind clutter is a bit more defensible than offscreen enemies killing me (I mean, they're trying to stay safe, I'd do that shit too). Enemy spawns can also feel really fucking cruel sometimes: several times while on the Mall map, I would use the escalator entrance in the parking garage to enter the mall, only to run into 1 to 2 Watcher squads or the Mall boss just hanging out right next to the escalator. And because enemies in this game react so quickly and deal so much damage, I would have very little time to make a proper decision, resulting in a death that AGAIN didn't feel very fair.

The larger point that I'm trying to get at though is that threats in Zero Sievert are sometimes difficult to locate until it's too late, and the reasons for why I wasn't able to locate them in time feel less like a ""skill issue"" and more like I wasn't given the visual information in time. Why can offscreen enemies kill me when I can't see them, even when scoped in? Why are three to six high-leveled enemies hanging out by the entrance in one of the maps ready to gun me down before I can have the chance to exit or fight back? This last example isn't unique to the Mall map - it happened at least once on all six maps (some are more forgiving than others).

I know that the difficulty sliders can remedy that, but as far as I'm aware, you can't adjust the difficulty sliders for a profile once you've selected them. How was I supposed to know the twitchiness of the enemies before actually getting into the game? I'm also a huge hater of games that let you customize their difficulty (it's an indicator to me that the developers don't know how to balance their own game), but that's a larger philosophical debate that doesn't need to be in this review.

On the subject of clutter, multiple times I was unable to complete a daily mission because a random car blocked the only entrance into a gated area or, in one case for me, the body of a scientist was wedged between two cars where I couldn't reach it. The only way to complete the mission then was to reset the map. The larger issue that I take here is that: this feels like something the devs NEED to make a coding exception for. Having tricky pathfinding in the game is okay, but not inserting some kind of safeguard to make sure that entrances/exits/critical loot containers are accessible feels like a ""fuck you"" to the player.

I gave Zero Sievert an honest go but I can't recommend it. Some issues I think could be resolved with updates and hotfixes, but others feel like the fundamental design of the game makes it inherently unfair. | Good game but a very frustrating experience on the steam deck (which is the only way I've played it). Actually navigating the world and shooting feels good. But navigating the menus, map, and inventory is awful. For example, you can't use the joystick to move around the map. Placing markers on the map is buggy, sometimes X works, sometime you have to press B instead, and sometimes neither work and you need to close the map, move, then reopen it to put down a marker. I also feel like I need to mash a menu button multiple times to get it to take. PLEASE add a quick equip button for controllers... finding a gun, moving in to your backpack, navigating to the equipped gun, unequiping, moving back to new gun and equipping is extremely unfun.

While I would still recommend the game, steam deck users be warned going in. | Fun pixel art singleplayer tarkov-like. 

UI is atrocious. No notifications when you can level up or upgrade. Inventory is lacking in basic QoL functions. No idea whenever a NPC has a new quest. The hideout upgrading is weird. Very frustrating, puts me off. THE WHOLE THING NEEDS A REWORK!!!

Coming back after a year or so and seeing that not much has changed in this area is disappointing and discouraging. On the other hand it speaks on how good the game is, if it makes me look past these issues. | 2D視点だから物理的に敵が見えない場面がある。そのため、木が密集している場所、岩の裏、建物の裏、車の裏などにNPCが隠れているとクリアリングしても死ぬ。また上下の視点が横視点と比べて著しく悪く、視点範囲外から理不尽に撃たれる。スコープを装備すれば多少ましになるが、いちいち覗く必要があるためストレスでしかない。上記以外にも建物の外に敵がいると建物から出た瞬間に撃たれるため理不尽に死ぬ。建物と外は別のマップ扱いであるためどうしようもない。

総評としてよくできたゲームだと思うが、主に視点関連で出来の悪さが極めて目立つ。理不尽に死ぬことに慣れている人にはお勧めする。

Nothing about it sounded fun. But then I watched a video of someone playing it on YouTube and thought it looked much more fun than the promotional videos had shown. So I gave it a try and OMG, I totally enjoyed this game. It has no right to be as fun as it is. I tend to be a completionist and this game helped scratch that itch. The best part is that I'm a huge fan of Castlevania so that DLC was just the greatest thing I never knew I needed. Seriously, for me the Castlevania DLC made the game at least 10x more fun.

My only complaint would be it's kind of a one and done for me. Once everything is collected I don't feel a need to play it. Loved playing it that first time around though, collecting all the things, unlocking all the stuff, it was fantastic. I'd have to do a complete fresh install to relock everything to make unlocking it again enjoyable. But still, it was the best 190+ hours of my recent gaming life :D | It's a fun game where you survive 30 minutes at a time (15 with hurry mode or endless when unlocked) as hordes of enemies crowd your screen and you get ever increasingly ridiculous weapons. A good number of hours out of it, especially for the price point. There's a lot of characters, different weapons, evolutions, secrets, stages etc. Sometimes things get so ridiculous that you can't even see what's going on anymore, but it's all part of the charm of the game.

I don't really have any critiques, because it does what it sets out to very well. I will say though that the game is considerably easier than I expected it was going to be going in. | A lot of people like it but I honestly found it kind of boring. Just wander around automatically shooting stuff until you get overwhelmed, then repeat. It's fine but wasn't my kind of game. | This game has the best ratio between the amount of fun you'll have with the fewest amount of buttons. I've never played anything this deep with literally just WSAD and Space. Also, 5€ full price for this? What a bargain. I get that it's a simple game, but come on. Give yourselves some credit, devs. And thanks for the full ultrawide support, although I would prefer a third option to solid and transparent black bars, which would be no black bars, but that's a massive nitpick.

EDIT: Ooooooh! That's how they make money! They have DLCs, so the whole game is actually 20€ if you want everything. That makes way more sense. Still too cheap though, because from what I've tried from the DLCs so far, they are very good and definitely worth the asking price. | Literalmente el juego del vicio a su máximo esplendor, el trailer habla por si solo, vas a dejar tu vida jugando a este juego para conseguir todos los desbloqueables y probar todas las combinaciones o personajes posibles.

El contenido que obtienes de juego por lo que pagas es totalmente justo, ya poseo todos los DLC hasta la fecha y realmente cada uno suma una cantidad de contenido absurdo que da para aun mas horas de juego.

Además, como fan de la saga Castlevania es muy divertido ir notando cada una de las referencias que guarda este juego y cuando añadieron el DLC de Castlevania, literalmente explote.

76561197999482693,1097350,Weird West: Definitive Edition,0.7,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation",1,"Weird West could have been a great game. The potential is there, buried under the surface, but it’s weighed down by a posse of bugs, inconsistencies, and downright baffling design decisions. Instead of riding tall in the saddle, this game stumbles its way through the desert, ending up as a mediocre experience at best.

Let’s talk about the controls—or lack thereof. They’re frustratingly bad. Who thought it was a good idea to combine an isometric, top-down perspective with combat mechanics that awkwardly mash together Max Payne-style gunplay and real-time strategy? It’s like trying to herd cattle with a pogo stick. And if that wasn’t enough, the camera refuses to cooperate during combat. Since you can’t rotate it, you’ll often find yourself squinting through obstructions or completely losing track of the action.

It’s a real shame because, beneath all the chaos, the game does some things right. The ""immersive sim"" elements—like interacting with the environment and objects or experimenting with creative solutions—are well implemented. You can see the glimmers of a truly great game here. Unfortunately, those glimmers are overshadowed by how rushed the whole experience feels, especially toward the end of development.

Then there are the bugs. Oh, the bugs. Bodies vanish into walls, traders sell items at laughably strange prices, and enemies respawn in odd locations after reloading your save. Stealth missions are a headache because enemy AI behaves like it’s had one too many drinks, running in random directions or spotting you at the worst possible moment.

On the bright side, the story is actually pretty compelling, especially if you’re into occult themes. The narrative could have been the saving grace, but it’s dragged down by the game’s technical missteps and uneven execution.

In the end, Weird West lives up to its name—but not in the way you’d hope. It’s plenty weird, sure, but it misses the mark where it matters most. This game is a frontier full of wasted potential. | First of all, all the complaints about the game being repetitive are partly true: 
- The music that plays in different locations, could vary between towns, as it is always the same. The structure of the buildings is very similar between towns, which made me feel like I was in the previos town but with the buildings moved around. 
- If you decide to have a bad reputation with the characters, although at the beginning you notice it, then I felt like I didn't become the “bad guy”, the story goes on and the bounty hunters seem to have gotten bored of me, because they don't come out much. Also the interactions with the main characters in the story are quite similar to what you would have with high reputation.
- And the most important, is that you can't explore the whole map from the beginning because if you do, in the rest of the journeys you will get bored. So you have to explore but not too much, how will I know how far to explore if the game doesn't set limits?

But it's not all bad. Many complaints say that the game is repetitive in terms of what we have to do, but I don't see it that way. The game offers you many tools and many skills with each character that allows you to interact in multiple ways. Not only that, but if you max out the characters and recruit them later, they will use them when fighting, giving you a great advantage upon enemies.


In short, I would recommend this game and suggest the people that play it that follow the path and don't digress too much of the main story, or later you'll regret it one way or another. 
8/10 | Excellent western game with complex & interesting characters. If you like games where your decisions matter-- there are very few that can rival Weird West in that regard. It's shorter (took 21 hours to finish), but at the same time I didn't exactly 100% it (some sidequests got skipped because I simply didn't know how to finish them lol)

The world is fascinating, and highly reactive. Everything you do can have huge impacts on lives. The best, non-spoilery example I can give is that if you kill a man, his wife might remarry, and the wive's last name will actually update to her new husband's. The only other game I can think of that rivals that level of detail & reactivity is a heavily modded run of skyrim or Balder's Gate 3. 

As for actual gameplay: You play as 5 different characters throughout sections of their lives. Each has different powers, but you can share inventory between them so there's a sense of progression that isn't bound to ""this character is X level"". Highly rewards stealth & thinking. Don't have lockpicks to get past a gate? see if there's some boxes you can stack nearby to jump the wall. But good news is: it doesn't REQUIRE stealth. If you get spotted, you can dig in and have a fire fight worthy of the western genre. 

I plan on playing this again soon to make some choices I didn't make in the first (my ""outlaw"" run) and see how different the game is-- which is not something I usually do. 

Overall: Top 5 game for me. | Jeu un peu foutraque, mais une ambiance et un savoir faire manifeste dans l'ouverture du gameplay qui font pardonner bien des petites aspérités de l'oeuvre. | Me encantaría que me gustara, tiene un montón de elementos que lo hacen único he interesante, pero entre objetos que necesitaba para avanzar que desaparecen una dificultad elevada por controles de tanque sinceramente, se hizo tedioso suelo terminar las  juegos que empiezo, pero este pudo con migo,  Pruebalo y hazte una idea pero no lo recomiendo, hace poco jugué hard west 2 y ese me parece mucho mas interesante."
76561197999482693,1888160,ARMORED CORE™ VI FIRES OF RUBICON™,1.5333333333333334,Action,3,"I cannot sing this game's praises high enough.

Intriguing story, thrilling combat, a lot of room for being both artistic and autistic about mech builds.  The boss fights are fucking transcendent, this game lets you experience those mech fights you had in your head as a kid.

The lore, like other Fromsoft titles, is very compelling.  Spoilers:
I love the concept of Coral as this [spoiler]mysterious naturally occurring substance that is at once energy source, information processor, and substrate for consciousness, one that has its own will and gains more and more crazy properties as it grows like some hive mind/swarm intelligence/neural network.  The ethics around the [strike]Human Instrumentality Project[/strike] Coral Collapse and whether it should be allowed to happen or prevented with the burning of Rubicon are very interesting to me.[/spoiler]

The multiplayer is incredibly fun, with a lot of room for (perhaps a hot take) diverse builds and creative expression in your gameplay, expression that can still be viable.  There are of course meta builds, and they particularly dominate the higher tiers, but its less a hierarchy and more a matter of what counters what.  But the meta builds are not so dominant that you can't beat them, there are still configurations of AC parts in this game that surprise people with how well you can make them work.  For me, finding those niche builds, making them work, and surprising everyone with their effectiveness brings me the highest of joys.

This has been my autistic obsession for a year now.  It hits the intersection of great story and lore, cool af cinematic fights both in the campaign and against other players, creative expression in your build and in your drip, and high skill ceiling, that for me genuinely makes this one of the best gaming experiences I have ever had in my life.  This game speaks to me on a spiritual level, it has my soul in its tender, coral embrace.  It's the kind of obsession that sparks the highest of joys whenever someone I know experiences this.  This game cured my depression, my ennui, and my ligma.  

10/10, would experience again. | Probably one of the Greatest Games I've played. There is a ton of customizations you can make in Armored Core 6, the difficultly scaling based on you're loadout, for example using only melee can be really challenging. Like any game in it's genre some bosses can be very challenging often requiring a lot of patience and deaths to get pasted, There's probably about 75-ish hours from just doing everything in the game depending on how good you are. 
Try not to look at any gameplay besides the first mission as the story is amazing. The amount of details and story behind things in the game is Incredible. Overall Remember if you're going to get this game there's no easy difficulty, so get accustomed to what you're using and you'll have a far better time than just looking at builds to get past bosses, and don't fear being creative with what you use either. In the end, it's your story so use whatever you want in the game, and most importantly don't forget to smile. | One of the single best action games out on PC.  Great pacing, fights, mechanics and mech customization.  MP is the usual fromsoft netcode bs, but the campaign is genuinely one of the best I have ever played.  Levels are fun, and sometimes challenging and it's definitely worth figuring out the struggles. | Amazing Game 10/10
I went into this game thinking it'd be a fun fast paced mech game where I get to blast things and have fun. I was 100% right.
This game is perfect for those who have no idea about the Armoured Core Series, basic fills in everything for you through storytelling, even if you do skip all the dialogue you still have a good idea of whats going on through game dialogue. 
What I found the best aspect of this game was the customisation. Like Souls-like, Souls-born etc, those usually follow the same formula of gameplay no matter the bulid, basically boiled down to buff-play agressive or otherwise-and dodge. Of course in those games the skill celling can be quite high. What I love though is that AC6 makes you play to how you want. You can be a fast glass cannon, dodging left and right, or a tank carrying the heavy weapons, or a flying gun fortress. All bulids, force you to play a certain and I love it, the best part is that most bulids are perfect if you've made it for youself.
 | Great action mecha game. if you like mechs, then this game is for you. 

Story : 7/10

As most fromsoftware games be, the story is rich but the storytelling is very subtle through the environment, encounters, item descriptions, collections etc.. 

If you are an average player that don't bother to read every little things that they write out, then you will probably will miss out on most of the story. Well, you will end up watching vaatividya anyway to understand the story. 

that aside, you can still understand most of the context and understand what you fighting for through normal gameplay.  

The casts are amazing though. Even though they don't have faces that you can see, the voice acting is incredible that you can feel every emotion through their voice. You are able to connect with these characters and understand their personality through their voices alone, it's amazing!

The story is short, first playthrough took me only 20~ hours, and around 40 hours total for whole 3 playthrough (there's 3 endings). but different new game+ have some additional missions and branching decisions that you can choose, so it's not repetitive. Though some newgame+ playthrough, they just add more enemies, it's more artificial difficulty and annoying rather than fun.

Gameplay : 8/10

Gameplay is very good. I think the core gameplay of the game is building the perfect mech for you to overpower your enemy. With different leg types, weapons, bodies, it all dictates how you will play the game. Sometimes the missions/bosses require different type of gameplay. You might want to be very fast, or a very tanky mech, change the weapons a bit to maybe laser, or maybe guns etc, they all perform differently in different situations.

At some point of the game you might find a perfect build that can handle most of the bosses without changing ur build, but the payoff is that the gameplay is pretty much the same at that point. Of course learning your enemy is important but when you have that perfect build, sometimes it doesnt matter and it plays the same everytime. For example, when i have a build that lets me move very fast, i can just move at one direction and pretty much dodge most of the enemy attacks without thinking much. Whether you think that is good or bad, it's up to you. For me, the balance is good as i only have to change my build few times to unblock my progress. 


Visuals : 8/10

Good. Not much to talk about, the mechs designs are amazing, despite most of the map being ruins, they managed to insert some colours that makes the environment pop and beautiful. 

Music : 7/10

Some are good, few are amazing. but for the most part, they are okay. Can only think of 2 song that are amazing and memorable. 

Summary : 

It's a good game. If you are willing to play 3 playthrough, it will be around 40~ hours of gameplay. If you are fan of mech, i'd definitely recommend, though I would probably buy it on a discount.

76561197999482693,1940340,Darkest Dungeon® II,3.3333333333333335,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",11,"After spending over 900 hours immersed in Darkest Dungeon 2, I can confidently say it is a challenging yet rewarding masterpiece. The game strikes a balance between punishing difficulty and the exhilaration that comes with overcoming it. If you're looking for a game that demands strategic thinking, and rewards adaptability, this is it.

Initially, I found the level of randomization in the game—particularly at launch—to be overwhelming. Too often, failure felt like the result of bad luck rather than poor decision-making. However, the developers have worked  to address this issue through a series of updates and balance changes, creating an experience where every loss feels like an opportunity to learn and grow. Today, success in Darkest Dungeon 2 is far more about your strategic choices, your understanding of the game mechanics, and your knowledge of enemy behavior. This shift has made victories feel even more gratifying and defeats less frustrating - most of the time :)

One of the most impressive aspects of the game is how it encourages experimentation.  Every team composition is now viable—a huge improvement from the early days when certain combinations felt sub-optimal. With a bit of understanding of game mechanics and enemy abilities, you can succeed with any group of characters, which has transformed Darkest Dungeon 2 into a sandbox of tactical possibilities.

The journey itself—navigating the game’s haunting, beautifully rendered landscapes—is unforgettable. Every step feels consequential, and every decision matters. Whether you’re managing your team’s stress levels, deciding which encounters to tackle, or weighing the risks of pushing your luck for better rewards, the game constantly challenges your ability to think ahead and adapt on the fly. The tension is relentless, but it’s this very pressure that makes every small victory feel monumental.

Another standout feature of Darkest Dungeon 2 is its community. The game’s fans are incredibly supportive, and the tight-knit nature of the player base fosters a sense of camaraderie that’s rare in today’s gaming landscape. Whether you’re looking for tips, sharing war stories, or just enjoying the creativity of small but dedicated content creators, there’s always something to engage with. The content creators, in particular, deserve praise for consistently producing entertaining and insightful material that enhances the overall experience.

In its current state, Darkest Dungeon 2 has become everything I hoped it would be and more. It’s a game that demands your respect, tests your resolve, and rewards your persistence. While it’s not for the faint of heart, for those willing to embrace its challenges, the payoff is unparalleled. Whether you’re a seasoned veteran or a newcomer, this is a journey worth taking—a journey into madness, perseverance, and triumph. Darkest Dungeon 2 isn’t just a game; it’s an experience, one I’m thrilled to recommend to anyone who dares to face its horrors. | [h1] YES, IT IS NOT DARKEST DUNGEON 1! [/h1]

However, this game deserves a way higher rating. It is fun, it is well made, it is unique experience.
Unfortunately its main game loop takes away several aspects that Darkest Dungeon 1 players enjoy so much.
This explains the sour ratings for an otherwise highly enjoyable game.

What is different:
Instead of slowly restoring your hamlet, your heroes travel the landscape with a stagecoach.
The expeditions are long and follow a roguelike gameloop. You can choose which regions to travel to and, like in many other roguelike/roguelite titles, select the next waypoint from a choice of 2 or 3 options.

Positives:
1. First off.. the greatest thing about it.. THE SOUNDTRACK. 
Stuart Chatwood filled this game with a bunch of absolute bangers: Sprawl Battle, Traverse the Mountain and Battle of the Mountain - these songs will put you on edge in epic decisive battles, where small mistakes will be even more punished than in the first iteration of the game. Sprawl Battle became my personal most heard song on Spotify.
2. The graphics are great. The pre-move animations add a lot of life and dynamic action in comparison to the more static first Darkest Dungeon. The winddown animations are just beautiful too.
3. The relationships between characters are a fantastic addition. Unluckily, it became a bit too easy to always get good relationships, which often makes the game a lot easier. Unluckily the powered up moves are random and sometimes just useless.
4. The boss fights can be hard if you bring the wrong team comp. To me, these harder fights are very enjoyable. Beating the boss with one man standing basically in the last swing was a very amazing and memorable experience.
5. The token system adds a bit more consistency in your battle plan. For most players, this might be an improvement. I personally enjoyed the randomness of the first part a little more.
6. The reflection shrines tell the stories of the heroes and are really cool.
7. The narrator (June Wayne) delivers once again and the lines slap hard. Yet, most lines feel less iconic than the first part.
8. Less micromanagement.

Negatives:

1. There is no gravitas when failing a run or when a characters dies. You don't lose them. You can just select them again in your next run. This bitter aspect of the first Darkest Dungeon is what made it so thrilling. Here you can basically end a run early with little consequences. Sometimes it is the best course of action to abandon midway and cut your losses.
2. Good team comps are limited. You can't play some goofy stuff anymore like 4 Lepers.
3. Decisions along the way have no impact. You decide on whatever resource you need most in the moment.
4. Many beloved characters are missing in the base game and are trickling in with DLCs. As things are progressing right now, getting the full DD1 roster in the future might cost you another 50-100 bucks.
5. Camping is replaced by the inn, which is less immersive. The fear of ambushes and the little moments of respite inside the dungeons was a great touch.
6. Spending a few hours just to get smacked by a boss or miniboss is pretty bitter. Yes, you can upgrade a bunch of stuff and it was not completely for naught. But the upgrades are whatever.
7. Many paths of the heroes are inferior to other paths and for me there is no reason to play semi-useless builds.
8. Some characters are strong and they play nicely (e.g. Highwayman and Man-At-Arms). Some characters are quite weak like the Runaway.

Conclusion:
It is not Darkest Dungeon 1. It is still a fantastic game. Some gameplay mechanics are better, some are worse.
The DLC money-squeeze is a bit of a turn-off. Especially hiding already designed characters behind a paywall is a huge no-no.

Addendum:

This is a singleplayer game. I am not speedrunning. Why do you want to monitor my RAM? | 红钩你真是个剑冢，单角色dlc42块，首发没折扣，还会炸存档。本来冲着情怀可以忍气吞声一下，这时候红钩来了，说：你们不要生气哦，新玩家109块能拿下本体和所有dlc哦。今天是除夕，我想狠狠地除外你们制作组的亲妈，一群背刺老玩家的出生。 | 纪念教授和老祖的配音演员，希望红钩后续更新能对得起配音演员的付出。 | If you are concerned about the negative reviews on this game, it is imperative you ignore every and all negative reviews comparing this game to Darkest Dungeon 1.

This game is not a ""remake"" of DD1. They didn't ""take away features"". Red Hook have made it abundantly clear that Darkest Dungeon 2 is it's own game and while it has the same art style and battle system of the first game (thus why it's called Darkest Dungeon 2 and not something else like other reviews say it should be) it should be viewed as it's own experience rather then compared to a almost totally different game.

I have hundreds of hours in both games and I love them both dearly for their own merits. If you prefer DD1's long campaign and are not a fan of DD2's rougelike confessions mode or the shorter campaign in kingdoms mode. That's totally fine! DD1 isn't going anywhere and you can go and play that right now. But just because you prefer how DD1 did things, it doesn't make DD2 a bad game. It just means you prefer DD1's gameplay loop. The last thing Red Hook wanted to do when making DD2 was make DD1 obsolete so they tried their hardest in not making Darkest Dungeon 2 just more of Darkest Dungeon 1. This is the key thing you need to realise when getting into DD2 when you're a long time DD1 player.

Sadly because of the recent negative reviews I felt like I needed to go on this long rant but I will quickly gush a little about this game for people who are completely new to the series and want to give this game a try.

Darkest Dungeon 2 is a wonderful experience I would strongly recommended to any turn based RPG fan, especially if you're looking for something a little tougher since this game does not pull any punches. The art style is beautiful gothic horror and despite the dreary look, the game's theme of hope is extremely uplifting and inspiring. It is all tied together by Wayne June's (R.I.P) excellent narration. Needless to say, I highly recommend giving this game a try. Good luck and remember that in each of us there is a hopeful light holding fast against the hellish shadows that gather between our good intentions."

Game has tons of unlockables and has a colaboration with every single indie under the sun. Also the game sort of fixes one of the main problems roguelikes have, which is getting your run going after a loss by giving you incentives and bonuses for completing the start of levels fast.

Whilst i'm not a big fan of this game, i can praise it for how good it is.
Roguelike-wise, you can get some ultra busted runs, and has a lot of roguelite elements as progression with the shop.
the game isn't that unforgiving, and it strikes a perfect balance between being ruthless and forgiving at the same time.

I give this game a 9.5/10. | Dead Cells is a really fun action-roguelike game that I truly enjoyed playing and completing for the first time. I have always loved metroidvanias (such as Hollow Knight) and roguelikes (such as TBOI), and this game really gave me the enjoyment I got from both games. Each run feels rewarding to find and collect new items you have never seen before. As for the DLC, I feel as if it has sufficient content but is slightly overpriced and you should only buy it on sale with the DLC bundle deal. I am more than satisfied with the post-completion content that this game offers, including 6 difficulty settings and many areas to explore.

76561197999482693,597180,Old World,4.433333333333334,"Simulation, Strategy",12,"Old World (OW) is brilliant in its design and the experience it creates. OW is the most interesting, if not the best, 4x, tactical, turn based strategy currently! Complex, challenging and fun!

(MANY) POSITIVES
1 AN AMAZING PACE: OW has a brilliant mechanic of Orders that limits how much you can do in a turn. Everything, but production in cities, costs Orders: moving and using workers, scouts, army, attacking, council tasks, interactions with courtiers and nations. Each turn you think, prioritize and make choices. 
This way everything in OW feels earned. Because of the Orders limitation even in the late game a war can be exhausting for your empire. Moving many army units can deplete your Orders pool, not leaving any for workers, heir education, or scouts. Of course things get easier with time, but still you can find yourself vulnerable. One of the rare strategy games where the late game is cool!

2 CLEVER SYNERGY OF THE GAME'S SYSTEMS
In OW everything relates in a deep, satisfying way. Opinions of you impact how well armies fight, productivity of your cities, courtiers interactions with you. Resources and Buildings have efficiency combinations. All systems of OW interact.

3 TACTICAL WARS WITH PROPER AI
OW has competent AI that plays the game properly. It's perhaps a 4x game with one of the better AIs I've played against. In a war it tries to flank you for max damage, shoot from hills for maximum range, use forests to minimize ranged damage etc. War in OW is tactical. Flanking, units adjacency, terrain, and preparation (you can't heal in a neutral land, unless you have certain skills) - it all matters. 

4 DIPLOMACY IS COMPLEX AND CRUCIAL
Diplomacy in OW has two levels: internal and international with Opinions mechanic that synergizes with other systems. 
In OW you don't just establish cities of your civilization. With each new city you choose a renown family to run it (3 families each game out of 4 options; each nation has a different set). They have different bonuses, interactions with terrain, demands and limits to what character can govern their city. This way cities are different to each other. The Families opinion matters. Low Family opinion affects the maintenance of their cities. Armies you produce belong to the families and their combat effectiveness synergizes with your internal diplomacy as well (including General's opinion of you if one is added to an army).
On top of that you also have individual characters (courtiers) with friendships, love affairs, rivalry, assassinations, ambitions (power hungry), or significant public popularity (Rising Stars that can overthrow you). You also have civil wars where you may end up destroying your own city. 
Wars in OW can be intense and can significantly compromise what you can do in a turn. It really pays off to prevent war with a political marriage, even with a tribal leader against the public opinion, than risk invasions on multiple fronts. Besides, happiness in attacked cities tanks down and this can trigger further problems (unhappiness raises city's maintenance and a chance of rebellion). War in OW is a big deal: victories can boost your Legitimacy, but defeats break it. You need alliances and proper diplomacy to secure survival. You invest in building trust (Opinion) for more diplomatic options. 

5 The BARBARIANS, TRIBES AND FIXED CITY SPOTS
Besides different nations OW has Barbarians and 6 different tribes. Tribes may occupy vast or smaller map space with their camps. And the tribes in OW can be devastating. Each camp spawns units every few years and if too many they become raiders, even if you're at peace with them. You can get unexpected mini invasions where they pillage, attack cities and wound/kill workers. So your city placement, armies stationing and natural barriers like mountains play a role. 
There are benefits to defeating tribes and to alliances with them. In OW you have fixed city settlement locations. A few guaranteed ones at the start; more you get from warfare or diplomacy. I think the fixed City Spots improve the game significantly. There's no dumb AI settling a city on your border for irrational tensions. And a wide expansion makes you think and plan how you can secure distant, new cities. 
Overall, the tribes in OW add a lot of tension, threat and historical sensitivity that I really like.

6 ECONOMY WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF RESOURCE TYPES
All resources matter and you can run short of something even in the late game. Access to the best units is not just a matter of tech, but also depends on the level of your culture, a chain of buildings and multiple resources to maintain them.

7 DYNAMIC, MORTAL CHARACTERS
Playing as a mortal ruler, that you develop in stats and traits, is more fun than having one fixed option throughout eras.
I love the Archetypes for Characters, with different layers of bonuses when acting as the Leader, Governor or army Commander. For Instance a Builder Leader can assign multiple workers to a project and they have -1 turn to build improvements and more. 
It's also brilliant that courtiers' stats contribute to the resources pool of your empire. Giving them a job provides a yearly experience, thus upgrades. Using courtiers missions gives them even more experience. This way even having spy agents in foreign empires benefit your resources pool. Its a dynamic system where you want to use courtiers, they change and play an important role. 

8 EVENTS THAT BRING FLAVOR AND VARIETY
OW claims to have over 3 thousand events!!! Some go in chains and develop over time. Some involve historic characters and situations. I love that the OW events pop up with jingle sounds! Big, immersive windows with beautiful art! Love all the art of Wonders especially – they represent so well the grand scale of these projects! My favorite events are when a courtier becomes inspired by my empire's wonder (that they aren't just buildings with buffs) and when a battles winning general becomes a Rising Star and creates a political threat. It's empire AND character building together with storytelling.

9 there is DEPTH, NUANCES, AND HISTORIC SENSITIVITY
So many things in OW make it's ""world"" alive and interesting beyond the clickfest of developing tiles or attacking.
When your worker is wounded it builds a turn longer. 
When you're allied with a tribe you control their units. And when ravaged by war a Tribe can ask you for refuge, creating slums in your city. 
Scouts in OW can do many things and remain useful. From providing Legitimacy for discovered landmarks, to harvesting resources and spying. With proper tech, a Scout can establish spy network in foreign city. Then your spies can provide you with vision and destabilization options; for instance you can try to trigger rebellions in several cities at once right before you attack. All these in a Civilization like game!!!

I also like that the Tech options are semi-random.

10 ART STYLE, (fantastic) MUSIC, and ATMOSPHERE
Music in the OW is just AWESOME! Sometimes I just keep playing OW because I enjoy its soundtrack so much. 
It's a good looking game that sticks to one period of history but with depth and atmosphere. This way playtime isn't that long, but isn't short either. Due to the Orders mechanic limitations other players turns go fast, so less waiting time.

LAST BUT NOT LEAST
The game has never crashed for me.
I haven't found OW to be overwhelming to learn. It took me around 10 hours to become familiar with all the basics. OW has an excellent in-game encyclopedia.
The game is very customizable. 
The base game of OW has the full, good experience and not hiding crucial features behind paid DLCs. 
OW is first and foremost a great strategy game (with RPG flavor). It has a healthy complexity, depth, historic references, and fulfilling struggle.

NEGATIVES
In spite of symmetrical design, I've got an impression some nations are much better than others. I'm still figuring out if it's inflexibility of my playstyle or design's imbalance. | I am a university professor, game developer, and 4X TBS game fanatic. I played, developed, collaborated on, play tested, analyzed, wrote about, and searched for 4X TBS games most of my life. 
I played thousands of games and tens of thousands of hours of TBS games. I make this post after 300 hours of playing Old World. My estimated level of knowing and understanding Old World and its features: 60%.
Far from being perfect, but my perception is that Old World is currently the second best game out there. (I may be biased to 4X TBS, although I played many other genres).
Old World has the usual big problems with the UI: cumbersome, confusing, slow, buggy. Its AI seems to be somewhat better than the other 4X TBS AIs. As of today, 4X TBS AIs without exception are very poor based on my personal experience with hundreds of these games. 
But Old World’s design is one of the best I have seen so far in any 4X TBS game. Finally, I see Order Points that limit the number of actions per turn and limit my movements. I advocated for this for 30 years in 4X TBS development. This game has great feature diversity, depth, and attention to details. Many things can be customized, even the music. I am yet to try the multiplayer. The developers genuinely understand and care about their product which combo is rare to find in the 4X TBS genre. This is not just another dumbed down “clone” of an earlier game that dominates the 4X TBS market today. They still push new patches which is great. This game is similar to Civilization 4, but much better. It also has tactical depth, role playing, and probabilistic planning, and a lot more. Kudos to the developers and I wish they will provide many years of support to fix the bugs, improve the UI, further tune the balance, and strengthen the AI to make the game even better than now.
 | This game cheats during combat. Making moves the player can't make. 
The Computer always has 2,000 Shields, which allows it to Force March troops, even after spending all of those points to move troops or attack. 
EVERY army the AI has, has a General in it. 
The AI brings back Generals the next turn.
It's oppressive. 
90% of the Events that happen are bad for you, or negative, or cause negative effects.
It's way too hard to be peaceful and ally with another nation. 
No matter what you do, what tech you have, or how good you are with other AI players, they backstab you.
The Orders system is F'd, because you're restricted every turn, and you can't DO everything you need to do in your turn, like fight a war. If your king/queen has less Orders (moves) than the enemy and you have to fight a war, you're already dead. I hate it. 
I've been trying to deal with this since I got the game, and have disliked it, and the further I get into a game, the worse it becomes. This ONE issue is enough to make me never play it again.

I've been spending up to 12 hours a day in this game for days now, and it's just stupidly overpowered against the player. Just when you start to get things right, the game sh_its on you. I had a few years of absolute peace, and building up my army and building up my cities, only to get absolutely rolled by the AI, who always had better tech, had more troops, and never ran out of Generals. 
The movement across mountains, or using more Shield points than it should have to move troops is what did it for me. 
I know the AI cheats in every game vs. Humans, but this is ridiculous. 
F this game. It's got so many problems that Civ doesn't have. It's like they looked at Civ and went, ""You know, how do we make the game way harder, and more difficult at the same time?... Oh, I know! We'll add families and traits, and negative events THAT NEVER STOP every turn so the player never wins...""
Also, this game will make your computer get really hot, max our your fans on your GPU, and has a conflict with Medal where it makes Medal tell you it's going to record the game every 5 min. 
I had 2 cores heat up to 92c, which NEVER happens. And maxed out all of my P-Cores to min of 80c. (80-92c) That's insane!
I have a 13900K (Yes, I did the BIOS update to keep it from melting.) with a Lian Li 360 AIO running at full speed 100% of the time, and a total of 7 fans. 32GB of DDR5, and a 2080Super. I watch HWMointor because this game makes my computer a Space Heater. I watch voltages, I watch clock speeds on all cores, and I watch temperatures. No other game does this to my machine.
I don't know how people play this and are OK with it. 
I'll probably uninstall.
Don't buy it. It's not what you think it is. 
Just go play Civ and be happy. | I cannot describe just how much this game has come to dominate my life in the last two years. I've racked up over 1200 hours and I'm only jut starting to ease up.

Old World looks, feels and plays like it was made by 4X fans for 4X fans. It remedies so many of the genre's pitfalls, and the replay value is through the roof. The mix of nations, families, events and characters give each and every game a different flavour. The developers have also kept it consistently patched and tweaked. Cannot recommend it enough, this game beats any other in the genre. | Eine Partie Old World zu spielen ist für mich immer etwas besonderes.Jedesmal erlebe ich eine neue Geschichte und es ist einfach spannend.Fazinierend wie die Entwickler dieses auf die Beine gestellt haben.Wie die ganzen Mechaniken im Spiel ineinander greifen und ein so motivierendes immersives Spielerlebnis erzeugen.
Vorausgesetzt man lässt sich darauf ein.Denn es kann auch hart sein eine Partie zu spielen.Es kann frustrierend sein schlechte Zeiten zu überwinden oder mit  mehreren Kriegen konfrontiert zu werden.Sich dort durchzusetzen macht auch einen besonderen Reiz von Old World  aus.Für mich das beste 4x Game auf dem Markt.

There are multiple avenues to increase player character, all which you can naturally collect materials to increase by simply playing the many game maps offered. Each character has its own skill tree, set of items to craft, and interesting enough combos of skills to use. The game does feel quite ""samey"" with the different build paths being as follows:

1. Increase multicast/cast speed/AoE enough to be DPSing all mobs
2. Increase damage through ailment scaling or raw damage scaling
3. Tank stats are marginally important, usually not worth taking over anything else unless high rarity.

Regardless, the skill variety keeps the game interesting enough, and the developers clearly have a passion for this project. This game is for you if you enjoy reverse bullet hells with lots of meta progression. | First run was fun. Second run I got OP pretty fast. Subsequent runs the same thing. You just end up running in circles dodging smaller red circles. I usually killed myself when I got bored of running around in circles for 40 minutes. None of the abilities feel very unique or change game play much. No, thanks. | [h1]Soulstone Survivors.[/h1]

[i]It's been a long time since a game has blown me away, and this game does just that!

Everything from the gameplay, music, spells/abilities, and characters is awesome and makes you want to play and keep going. It's very addicting! 

Also the fact that it's in EA and feels complete already. 

The only thing I would say is if there were more unique maps to play on. You get five but after doing endless, it can get dry. More diverse maps and locations would be a plus!

Like I said before, the music is high energy and fits well with the game. There are so many characters to play through and each character has different builds; so lots of techniques and strategies to try out!

Great game! You can tell the devs actually care about their game and not just rush something out for a quick cash grab. 

Amazing game that has lots of replay value, and at a fair price for what you get! 

There is also a demo, and I guarantee you will be hooked after that!

This game is at the top of my list of favourites in this genre, and in general![/i] | Big numbers, nice!
Big damage, nice!
Big builds with many skill, nice!

In all honesty, one of the best Survivor-type games out there. If you enjoyed games like Vampire Survivors this is a huge upgrade with tons of fun, better graphics and progression! (No OP golden eggs, thank god)!"

Something I'm not entirely on board with is the pacing though. Usually you deckbuilders are stacked toward making it really hard to complete a run.

Cobalt Core carves out its own niche in the roguelike genre with a fresh approach to gameplay and mechanics. It’s a game that emphasizes strategic ship movement and the precise use of cards, creating tense and rewarding encounters that set it apart from the crowd.

The core gameplay shines with its focus on positioning and timing. Each move feels meaningful, and the balance between ship maneuvering and card usage adds a layer of strategy that keeps every run engaging. The length of each run is just right, avoiding the fatigue of overly long sessions while still offering a satisfying sense of progression.

One of the standout features is the lighthearted and charming cast of characters. Their short, meaningful conversations drive the story forward without bogging down the pace—a perfect fit for a roguelike game. The narrative elements provide just enough depth to make you care about the world and its inhabitants while keeping the focus on gameplay.

Visually, Cobalt Core is a treat. The 2D pixel art style is beautifully crafted, with vibrant colors and detailed designs that enhance the overall experience. The audio complements the visuals well, with a solid soundtrack and sound effects that add to the atmosphere without overwhelming the player.

While the game’s design is top-tier, its one notable flaw is the requirement to repeat runs to unlock additional content. This repetition can feel a bit tedious at times, especially for players who prefer more variety in their progression. However, the engaging mechanics and overall quality of the game help mitigate this issue.

Cobalt Core is a standout entry in the roguelike card game genre, offering a unique blend of strategy, charm, and polish. Its innovative mechanics, memorable characters, and beautiful presentation make it a must-play for fans of the genre. Despite some minor repetition, the game’s overall design and execution are top-notch, delivering an experience that’s as enjoyable as it is rewarding."

ps：像博得3的邪道线一样，想等退休了再拿出来盘一盘，试试异端线！ | tldr: I played this game over 200 hours for the lore and I can’t recommend it before they fix the broken content, skills, items and quests, etc.

I love this game for the lore it has and how it is presented to the player but I can't really recommend it because the first two chapters of this game are one of the best 40k content I have ever seen in games but at chapter 3 the game goes stale and following chapters 4 and 5 are full of rushed content and game breaking bugs. Some quests barely work properly half of the time and there are many major and minor things that are left broken, one thing you will see fairly often are random NPCs running or sitting in the air and sometimes after a fight the dead enemies are still standing or can be interacted with.

On higher levels near the end of the game your characters might have skills that do not work properly and there is a serious bug that appears in combat where if you take a shot with any bolter weapon in a certain angle with 95% or even 100% hit chance the shot will always miss the target and any shot fired on the same angle from the tile your character is standing in will always miss. The “fix” is to walk one or more tiles to any direction and when the game tells you there is about 37% or lower hit chance it actually hits 100% of the time (yes, even if it gives no % or says 0%). There are also some skills that have 50/50 chance of breaking the game so that the combat can't progress to next turn and the only option is to reload a save and do it all again while hoping the bug does not appear this time. On top of this there are some broken items you can equip and they do not give you correct stats or bonuses. There is also a bug that makes it possible to cheat and use certain dialog options multiple times at least in chapter 3 so you can get same quest reward items at least twice, this exploit will work on some other side missions as well in different chapters.

After all of the above they are now pushing the new DLC content for us to buy and I can’t really see myself paying for extra content while the base product is clearly broken. I do however see potential in this game and I hope Owlcat fixes it. | [h3]Amazing Story[/h3]

The game reminds me a lot of Baldur's Gate 3, but more in a steampunk universe. The story and gameplay are amazing, but keep in mind that you need to read a LOT! I have never played a Warhammer game before or knew anything about the lore, but that did not stop me from enjoying this game. Mini games like colony management and space combat are decent and bring variety. Character development and classes are robust. I can't wait to play more! | Прошел 1, 2 Pathfinder, потом посоветовали поиграть в Rouge Trader
Господи, какая это пушка! Явно больше чем просто работа над ошибками

Плюсы:
Огромное количество возможностей для отыгрыша персонажа
Геймплей
Замечательный арт и дизайн уровней
Саундтрек (особенно музыка в капелле на флагмане)
В процессе игры отметил много QOL улучшений в интерфейсе, по сравнению с PF

Из минусов:
Были путанницы с новой ролевой системой
Зависания вовремя загрузок (локации/мостик)
Патчи ""на горячую"" меняющие характеристики персонажей и ломающие определенные билды в середине прохождения
ИМХО меньше мотивации для перепрохождения, геймплей не сильно изменится (на примере PF, путь ангела или путь роя)

9/10 | One of the best games I've played in a while - fun combat, amazing story, immersive writing, surprisingly nuanced characters. Great job, Owlcat! Even as a newcomer to the whole WH40K setting you'll be properly introduced with the help of a dialogue encyclopedia, which explains important information when hovering above the keywords. 

Only Act 4 does feel a little undercooked imo. Other than that it's an amazing game and absolutely worth it's price. Lots of reading, but it never feels bothersome. Choices feel impactful. Conflicts feel genuine. The music is great. Will definetly replay soon."

It combines a campaign map with turn based battles. You can create your own civilization with its ruler and heroes, and play as the fantasy (or steam-punk) civilization you always wanted.

But I have some bigger issues with this game:

First off, since the last big update, the game has a tendency to crash on the campaign map. Which is really annoying, but dealbreaker for me is, that it also corrupts saves, so you cannot continue where it crashed. Especially annoying when you just fought a big battle and then lose all your progress.

Second is, that yes - you can create different civs - but in the end, they all play very similar. You always want to rush your city cap and just build as many armies as possible. Build wide, claim as much territory as possible. That's the strategy. The only difference is how your units look and what tomes you unlock. To be fair, some of the final tomes are very unique, but it takes a very long time till you get there and most of the game is already over by that point.

Third, the campaign map itself. You notice it is randomly generated. It's a combination of biomes with some features in it and some randomly placed ancient wonders. Every map looks similar. Sometimes it has more forest and sometimes more sand, but in the end, there are no ""unique"" landmarks or sights. After a few games, you have seen everything. Which would be okay, but one of the key points of this game is to go out and explore the map... which is just not interesting.

 | The game has a lot of fun customization and the actual combat is deep enough to be satisfying, but simple enough to be accessible. It's just a very well crafted game. My only gripe is that it falls into the trap of endless, expensive DLC that a lot of games of this nature fall into. | It's a good game. Early game is a blast. Middle game is so so. End game is boring.

I have the same problem with this game as with Total War series -- late game battles are boring and tedious, zero fun. In this particular example, auto combat is very well executed: AI actually plays the battle so no surprising results happen. But then, I never see those fancy hero skills which I choose with such care.

I recomend this for a few hours, 'till the boredom comes. | Mein Lieblings-4X Game.

The game has campain levels but you can also make fleets and battle them in a kind of sandbox mode (this is my favorite thing to do in the game).

The game also has a replay at the end of every battle that also allows you to add effects and take pictures, great for making a new battlestar wallpaper ;)


Overall good game | Cool game. It's turn based, but with both sides' moves occurring simultaneously. I had a lot of fun figuring out the different fighting style of each ship as well as their quirks and ideal horizontal and vertical positing. I only wish that there was more to do outside of the campaign. | Engaging space battle strategy, really enjoy the simultaneous turns and cinematic replay at the end. | I've only played the first tutorial so far and I'm already impressed.

Formations matter. Classic strategies such as controlled withdrawal on one oblique while pushing heavily on the opposite flank works well. The quality of troops matters tremendously. The impact of ground quality on combat (especially phalanxes) was gratifying. The degree to which you lose control of your army as it engages is also realistic. I haven't seen any game quite manage this. The historically obsessed can always find places to nitpick, but this is really as good as you are likely to get with a game that also manages to be fun. | Needs a good zoom in feature; sometimes it's too easy to lose track of units once they get into melee.  Other than that I like FOG 2 a lot.  A vast improvement in graphics over the first version. | 相当不错的古罗马-希腊时代的战术类SLG兵棋，唯一的缺点就是没中文 | Si tratta di una sorta di simulatore di battaglie, funziona a turni ed ogni unità è inquadrata in una casella di un'ideale scacchiera che coincide con l'intero campo di gioco. è un gioco semplice, ma sfizioso, vincere non è così facile soprattutto a difficoltà elevate (aumentare la difficoltà però da un certo momento in poi implica non un cambiamento dell'approccio dell'IA, bensì una banale diminuzione numerica delle tue truppe) e bisogna fare le scelte giuste per trovare strategie originali, sfruttando la conformazione del territorio (differenza di altitudine, boschi, fiumi...) e cercando di attaccare ai fianchi il nemico. Secondo me il gioco ha un livello di profondità non da poco: le unità sono molto curate da un punto di vista storico, il terreno di gioco influenza le battaglie, inoltre simula una reale battaglia nel fatto che non si mira all'annientamento dell'esercito avversario, ma alla sua messa in fuga- il morale è cruciale e dipende da diversi fattori (nelle campagne, dagli eventi, sennò da troppe ondate di frecce, una carica di nemici teoricamente meno forti ma che ha invece successo...). A me piace molto e diverte, ma va acquistato con la consapevolezza che non è un grand strategy o un simulatore in tempo reale tipo total war. | Muy buen juego de estrategia de batallas en la antigüedad.

76561197999482693,1937780,Total War: PHARAOH,0.0,"Action, Strategy",0,"ATTENTION: Don't believe this game's ""Mixed"" reviews! Total War: Pharaoh released a huge update last year called ""Pharaoh: Dynasties"" that was a *huge* straight up upgrade, but it's launched through another client. This means that the reviews for ""Pharaoh: Dynasties"" are separate from the base game's reviews. If you search up ""Pharaoh: Dynasties"" on Steam, you can see how the reviews on that are Very Positive, instead of Mixed. Also, because I'm writing this review for the base game, my total hour count is different, as I only play Dynasties. I have 32 hours on Dynasties currently.

Why that disclaimer? Well, because ""Pharaoh: Dynasties"" deserves better. It truly does. It is a fantastic strategy experience. There is a lot of fun to be had, a lot of replayability, so much charm and personality in it. The historical period is awesome (Bronze Age ftw) and the game's systems reflect that so well. There is so much to enjoy here. Resources to manage, cities and buildings to construct, battles to fight, gods to worship, courts for diplomacy and dynasties to be managed. What's cooler is that many of these systems differ depending on what faction and region of the world you're playing as/in. For example, each major faction has special legacies that are unique to them and grant them special ""abilities"" to use. The units you recruit are native to the region you're recruiting them from, which means that different regions will have different units that may be better or worse for your particular playstyle. This is just scratching the surface.

Not only you have all of these cool sandbox systems (and I'm not getting into the battles but they are super cool and fun to play too, and quite challenging at times), but there's also a huge degree of customization for your campaigns. You can choose to enable all deities to be available from the start, or have all legacies available to anyone, you name it. This game lets you play the way you want to and I think that's brilliant.

I'm not going super in depth in this review, but I hope you can feel the enjoyment I get from playing this through reading this. I love strategy games, mainly Civ games above all, but Total War is growing on me quite a lot and ""Pharaoh: Dynasties"" has been one of my favorite Total War experiences thus far. I absolutely recommend it. | The game has been improved and I would give it a 4/5 
However what I will say is that when you choose HARD it takes out all of the fun. Enemy units (even low tier) are way OP and it's not anything like other Total War games. Play on regular for a more fair experience. | Esta gente de los Total War hacen juegos muy bonitos, pero no saben o no quieren hacerlos de una dificultad equilibrada.

*The brainless map AI literally declares war for no reason and never attacks.

Slower paced battles, but imo much more satisfying combat than the fantasy titles. | 后续的更新也算还行吧，所以现在能做幕府3或者拿破仑2了吗？(≧∇≦)ﾉ | I like games where good play is fun play.

While I'm sure most Total War games have exploits, I haven't found them, and so I enjoy playing the games to the best of my ability and (at vh/vh) have a thrilling challenge.

In Total War: Pharaoh, the trade system is completely broken. The more people like you, the better deals they'll give; with a little work you can trade someone 1 food for 2 stone and then 1 stone for 2 food two hundred times and make them your best friend, and you can do this with everyone in the world. The game doesn't really work without trade - because you don't produce most resources yourself until the mid-to-late game, you're intended to trade for them - and it also doesn't work with trade, because trade is so broken.

The battles are neat. They're very unlike most Total War games. All the fancy national mechanics are super cool. But the trade system is so broken I still don't like the game. Sorry."
76561197999482693,2511500,Dominions 6 - Rise of the Pantokrator,3.683333333333333,Strategy,0,"You got three ages to choose from, each with their own flavor:

Early Ages; magic is abundant, high fantasy, low tech.
- Want to play as the Holy Roman Empire as Christianity was settling itself after Jesus's sacrifice? And attempt to revive him in game?
- Want to play as japanese Onis led by a hungry hungry Koi Fish? Or perhaps an old man? Or a bleeding fountain?
- Want to enslave everyone's minds as R'lyeh led by Aboleths?

Middle Ages; magic is starting to go away, but it's till very much there, ""normal"" technology (plate armor and such is starting to be worn)
- Remember the Holy Roman Empire? Well turns out something went wrong trying to bring Jesus back and everyone died and became an undead. Fulfill your Lich kingdom fantasies with MA Ermor!
- Want to play as Monkeymen that banished their evil demon overlords as they search for enlightenment?
- R'lyeh now has Squid People leading them, the Aboleths are missing. Their slavery practices remain the same.

Late Ages; magic is scarce, technology is at the all time high (full plate and crossbows are more common)
- There once was a race of cave-dwelling cyclops, in the Early Ages they released things that they really shouldn't (you can recreate that event in game!), in the Middle Ages, human refugees started joining their dying race, in the Late Ages, these cyclops are long gone but their human followers learned how to reanimate them and their golems, who they venerate  as divine beings.
- You can play as a fantasy version of China, with Dragon Emperors and everything!
- R'lyeh now spreads madness, even amongst their populace, the Aboleths are coming back... and they're not happy.

And oh boy, what you can do in these games...
- Let's start with the underground Cyclops, Agartha, Pale Ones. They don't need to eat and they're cold-blooded. You can turn off the sun so your enemies starve, or alternatively make another one and watch as crops burn, and your enemies struggle for survival as your giant army sweeps them while they're weakened.
- The Onis can increase unrest in a global scale, and they gain power from unrest
- Underwater factions can opt to freeze the oceans so nobody can enter their dominion, while they freely teleport their armies on dry land (as long as they're amphibious and not aquatic)

Your -pretender- god empowers Holy units by just existing. And oyu can customize it too.
- What if your holy mages or priests never got tired of casting spells and blessings?
- What if your holy cavalry had regeneration? And flaming weapons?
- You got a lot of Holy giant mosnters in your roster... and they're terrifying (literally)... wouldn't it be insane if to attack them every unit ahd to pass a morale test or be unable to strike them?

But wait, there's more! There's a lot of detail put into this!:
- Any unit that has lost an eye, unless they can regenerate them back, will remain with that eye missing. it affects accuracy.
- Units that lose a leg have their speed reduced.
- Lightning does more damage (and is more accurate) against targets with metallic armor or under spells that turn their skin to bronze or gold.

All of this and more, in a game where your enemies try to take your RIGHTFUL title of the God of the next ages. May the best God rule all. | I love this game I play it nearly every day and often nothing but it. I can't say in good conscience that I recommend it to others though simply because of how obtuse it is. I don't want it to be less complex and I certainly don't want any features to be taken away from it.

What I would like is if the game explained itself and it's mechanics a little more thoroughly or how things interacted better. There's not really any good reason for how poorly written a lot of the tooltips are, or how it doesn't do something to the effect of having things like path improvements to spells multiplied in the explanation for the player. I don't like the communities standard answer to new players of read the manual, not because I don't think people should you absolutely have to in order to really grasp this game. I think that telling people to read and memorize a 500 page document is probably not a reasonable standard to entry for a game. 

I get that Illwinter is a passion project by two people to make something they love, and I think the series focus should remain as such. But I think maybe hiring a third person to explain what's going on in took tips a little better might be a way to maintain the feel of the series without detracting from it. Basic things like putting in blessed if they stack with units that already have those attributes (examples like invuln blesses or fire shield, barkskin explains how it stacks or doesn't why can't they?).

If you asked me two months ago if I recommended this the answer would be a resounding yes, but I've tried to teach a few friends to play this and it's really interesting and fun when we use mechanics to discover new ways to play we hadn't thought about. I don't think those moments should be interfered with, I think they're the heart of the series and should be preserved at all cost. I think the game should explain itself well enough they happen more frequently. More players would be better for dominions if they were gained right. You've probably made a quarter of a million dollars on this game, I think if you hired the right technical writer you could probably make that a million and dominions would be better for all of us, and it would give the devs more time to focus on the parts of the game they clearly enjoy more.

Tldr hire lucid tactics or something you'd probably make money in the long run. Best game ever made thumbs down! | There is so much variety, many different nations who all play very differently, different Gods, even different ages. None of these choices are window dressing, they all drastically change the way the game is played.

don't mind bad graphics and a clunky old-school UI,

Я б порекомендував цю гру всім, хто шукає веселу, швидку та захоплюючу гонку з елементами стратегії і командної гри, особливо якщо ви любите хвилюючі перегони з елементами аркади. | Certamente um dos melhores needs já feitos. Tem corridas bem difíceis, algumas eu demorei dias pra passar, e tem também aquelas características clássicas da franquia, como os rivais roubados que tem uma aceleração absurda e carros que brotam na tua frente do nada, te fazendo arrancar os cabelos de raiva, e depois que passa a corrida é uma alegria só.

Runs surprisingly well on my steam deck | Машины в игре сделаны из бетона, только это объясняет их невозможность поворачивать без ручника. Вертолет - бесполезное дерьмо. Очень раздражает чрезмерная прочность легких суперкаров, которые выдерживают несколько лобовых столкновений на скорости более 200км/ч. Идея возможности играть как за гонщика, так и за полицейского интересная, но реализация очень средняя. Радует в этой игре только приятная графика. Старая Most Wanted на мой взгляд заметно лучше и интереснее, хоть игра и старше данной части на 5 лет. А вообще, если кто-то до сих пор в такое играет и ему интересны отзывы, попробуйте игры серии Forza Horizon."

Im Kern haben wir hier ein rundenbasiertes Arena-Taktikspiel vor uns. So schön auch Banner Saga ist, hier kommt nicht wirklich Stimmung auf. Das eigentliche Spiel lebt von seiner tollen Geschichte, die aber hier keine Wirkung entfaltet. Wir dreschen uns einfach mit ähnlichen Gruppen herum. Das zieht sich teilweise erheblich. Hauptproblem sind letztlich aber die kaum vorhandenen Mitspieler. Schade das man nicht auf die Idee kam auch Koop-PvE und Bots als Ersatz für menschliche Gegner für PvP einzufügen.

This game has a ton of potential to grow, and can be very prominent as a game. However, the fact that it is not original in itself compared to the actual banner saga game, and the fact that no one is able to play the game, as there is no one to play against in this multiplayer only game, makes this game a little less than promising. I would not waste time on this until the developers work on the game to increase popularity, through advertising or working on the game's content, of which it is lacking, if at all.

76561198025344110,230410,Warframe,100.56666666666666,"Action, RPG, Free To Play",54,"Warframe is a game that rewards you for the amount of time that you invest into it. If you wish for a surface level horde shooter with fun abilities then it will give you that experience in spades, however, it also has the ability to allow you to delve deeper into its systems and lets you customize and maximize your arsenal until you become a walking army.

The story is serviceable in the beginning but in my opinion ages like wine as you progress through the star chart, slowly pulling you into an experience that I have yet to relive in any other Sci-Fi game I've played. While it does go off the rails at times it does so in a way that feels believable and maintains a sense of internal consistency that keeps you informed while still asking questions.

Each frame feels unique even though the devs have released over 50 differing characters, each with a unique kit that (while falling into a manageable amount of categories such as caster vs weapons-platform) still allows players to express their own uniqueness through their selection of frames and weapons. It is rare that any two players' loadouts will be identical to one another.

It is definitely a game I recommend everyone to play at least once and one I definitely recommend to anyone who loves long grinds, deep (though sometimes confusing) mechanical systems, and extreme horde shooters. | Better Destiny"

1、共同回合的机制。对战双方同时执行自己的回合，然后统一结算。富有战略性，能体验运筹帷幄的快乐。
2、对战区域的划分。包括进攻区域、防守区域、支援区域、指挥官区域，以及由它们组成的概念：被部署区域、战场。区域的划分和不同区域特定的功能大大扩展了对战策略的可能性。
3、卡组机制。组成套牌前对势力的选择决定了你整个套牌的风格和可利用的资源，要求玩家不断取舍，最终完成自己喜欢的战术。
4、比较轻松的游戏体验。不需要大量的时间、精力和金钱投入。
当你在了解了整个游戏从确立思路、组建套牌到最终随机应变取得胜利之后，游戏的体验会相当不错。然而这款游戏的诸多缺点也就来源于玩家这个熟悉过程之前。
1、中文翻译不完整，概念解释缺失。游戏初期有诸多不加解释的概念，严重影响玩家融入游戏。包括组建套牌时的规则不明确，会让新手玩家摸不着头脑。
2、糟糕的网络连接。较差的网络环境甚至不能让你完整体验一场游戏。
3、UI（交互界面元素）设计不合理，拥有较多生物时会拥挤，难以精确操作。画面特效单一。
当玩家熟悉了这些之后，我仍然认为这款游戏值得喜爱卡牌游戏的玩家尝试一下。同时也希望官方能加紧改正上述缺点（如果可能的话）
希望我的体验能帮到大家，祝大家游戏愉快。
 | É um jogo de cartas animado em que você coloca diversas criaturas para duelar em seu nome. São vários adversários em uma campanha longa, que passa por diversos lugares e enfrenta desafiantes poderosos e repletos de recursos para frear a sua jornada.
Jogo bom, porém algumas funções meia confusas. | 粗略玩了一下.简单地来说一说自己的观点.
优点:
1.相较于其他卡牌游戏,双方同时执行回合的玩法增加了游戏的战略性
2.每个种族的特性较为鲜明
3.场地被划分为3块(支援区,进攻区,防守区)的玩法也增加了游戏的战略性

缺点:
1.每个玩家虽然拥有两种血量,但其实第二种血量(士气)基本只是为了龙族之裔的削士气战术单独服务.95%的时候士气都是多余的.作为游戏中的重要参数之一,略显累赘
2.卡牌技能介绍做地非常差,是我玩过的所有卡牌游戏中最差的一款,这足以成为让新人弃坑的原因.举例:人族某卡被部属在进攻区域后会拥有坚不可摧特性,至于坚不可摧是什么,我翻遍了游戏都没找到解释.也许是不受战斗伤害,也许是不会受到伤害,也许就是无敌.同上还有超载X,激怒X,虚弱X,生命X等
3.游戏的卡包过多,而且无法得知卡包内所包含的所有卡.只能通过牌组中浏览所有卡来逆向搜索自己想要的卡所在的卡包.
4.卡片虽然可以交易,但是与此同时也少了拆分合成功能.低稀有度卡极易数量溢出.且对于独狼玩家来说伤害巨大.
5.牌组组合界面操作相当难受,你能同时浏览到的牌只有一行约10张.而滚动牌堆时的操作惯性相当违和,稍微滚动一点只能翻过几张,而再稍微多滚动一点则是会一口气翻过去很多张.与此同时,当你想把牌加入指挥官位置时,如果放置位置不当,就会把所有同名卡全部移除牌组,然后你又不得不自己一张一张加回来.
6.游戏技巧需要玩家自己挖掘,战斗前的读取界面没有实用的小提示.举例:一般卡片的牌组数量限制为3,被加入到指挥官位置的卡不会被算入卡组数量限制.即,一张数量限制为3的卡最多可以在牌组中添加6张(指挥官位置X3+牌组X3).
7.游戏系统极其难受,当你在场上拥有大量单位以后,他们将在区域里挤成一团.而如果你想拉动他们到其他区域,你需要极其小心且不得不一张一张地拉动它们,假如你还想将他们的位置顺序交换,你还得再小心翼翼地拉动它们.整个过程对操作的精度要求比较高,至少不像是从手牌拍怪那样按住鼠标往上甩就好了.

虽然我列举的缺点比优点多很多,而且也不推荐这款游戏.但是我还是比较喜欢这款游戏的.优点虽然少,但是核心玩法还是可圈可点的.而且缺点大部分也不会经常经历.

至于不推荐的理由:
1.这款游戏不适合入门级卡牌游戏玩家以及欠缺耐心和金钱的玩家.游戏已经开服很久了,对于现在入坑的玩家来说,要补的卡包数量相当可观.而且由于没有卡片拆分合成系统.要不氪金完全组出自己的牌组需要以月为单位来积累.当然你能找到大佬免费送你卡当我没说.
2.2014年9月5日发行的游戏,我今天2017年2月12日刚玩了8.1个小时(通完剧情,教程,挑战,打了盘竞技场,开玩送的卡包,又自己买了一包开,自己组了一套牌组)就能发现游戏还有那么多不方便的地方,其中几个地方还令人发指(战斗时卡片聚堆)这让我对游戏开发商的态度以及能力表示怀疑. | wonderful game, can't understand all the hate is receiving. It's fun and entertaining, a perfect way to spend an hour or two in front of the pc. 

To the devs: please fix the japanese faction (you know, the green one based on morale ) because they're absolute trash right now, lol. | I have not played the remake of this game recently, but one big reason, and I hope the creators stop going down this path:

They've split their already small cult following into 3 by publishing 3 similar games with the same IP and similar gameplay. Not sure what the goal of that was, when their player base is already fairly small, because it's going to make me and others reluctant to invest in Infinity Wars Classic if it's going to be replaced by Infinity Wars 2 in the future. They really need to combine the games back into one, focus on it, and make it hit critical mass so that players can actually start recommending it to their friends.

EDIT: Thanks for the explanation! This makes more sense than what I had originally understood, so I've updated the review accordingly.

I will say that while I still have some doubts, the game design of Infinity Wars is honestly a masterpiece, it solves all the problems I've had with other online card games (like Hearthstone/MTGO) in the past. I'll highlight the two biggest points which I think other online card games got wrong.

Firstly, there's actual trading, and it doesn't feel like MTGO where it feels like you're trading with a stock market because there's thousands of copies of each card. It feels much more like going to a card game store and trading with friends, because there's multiple different rarities which make the more rare card+rarity combinations rare enough that they feel unique. This means that people will haggle, or look around to find someone who has that one card they've been looking for. Feels very much like trading in-person.

Secondly, it removes the RNG aspect of mana-based card games in the early game. Games with lands like MTG and Eternal suffer from mana flood/drought, which adds an unnecessary and un-fun element of RNG to the game. However, even Hearthstone which does not have lands, suffers from early game RNG because drawing cards on curve is extremely important to surviving/winning the early game, and makes early game much more RNG dependent than lategame. This game fixes both problems by having automatic mana increases like Hearthstone, but also giving you a choice of 3 Commanders which you can choose during deck-building to start every game with. This lets you pick defensive early game, and scaling options as a control deck, so you don't end up skipping your first 4 turns like other card games, and high tempo high power cards for aggro decks, so you don't feel like you just fall behind early game and have no hope because of a bad draw.

This review may have become very long, but it's because I honestly believe Infinity Wars is the best designed card game out there, and as long as they can get the UI/marketing done right, it will be a huge hit in my opinion."

And everyone lived happily ever after! | Unfortunately I don't feel like I can recommend this game. 
I mean, the game has some very interesting and fun ideas, but the execution, not so much. 
It is a very, very punishing game in lots of ways, like some dialogue choices where multiple skills are tested: even if you nail a test, but the other goes bad, then you're dead. We also never have enough skill points to be good in many skills, so the game forces us to specialize in either combat skills or social skill, despite the existing mixed ""classes"", like the assassin, who should be able to be relatively competent both in combat and civil skills, but we always lack the skill points to do so. 
Many of the skill checks just outright kill your character if you fail them, as there are no different degrees of succes (as far as I know), you either succeed or fail. 
What I mean is a game should be enjoyable without the player having to know all events and story beforehand so they can make a specific build to pass specific skill checks and succeed. 
There is also the problem of loading screens: they are quite slow, despite me having an SSD. And as I died a lot, I had to see many loading screens. 
Maybe I just didn't enjoy the game much because I started with the assassin class, a mixed class. 
I know the game is supposed to be punishing and gritty, but there is a mugger at every corner, and they can just rob and/or kill you and we can do nothing about it. And sometimes when we can, and do, something about it, we are just f***ed in another different way, anyways. 

If you wanna have a taste of learned helplessness, then this game for you. There are just too many fatal and otherwise harmful and unavoidable events and you can do almost nothing about it. So count yourself lucky if someone robs all your money but doesn't also kill you.  
It has quite a few good ideas, though, so if a sequel is polished a bit more and made a bit less punishing for mixed classes that would be a great improvement | This is a niche game that scratches the itches of fans of old Isometric Fallout and Baldur's Gate/Icewind Dale. If you like grimdark post-apocalyptic settings AND fantasy worlds, this game does both engagingly. In some games, you skip the dialogue and flavor text as fast as humanly possible, in others, you look for and read every tidbit; this game does the latter often. If you were already curious about this game, it doesn't disappoint. | What I like about age of decadence is that it really makes you think before doing something, it isn't forgiving, you can't just destroy everything on left and right, when you play this game, you'll truly understand meaning of words “best fight is the fight which never happened” and of course, the most important is variety, everything you do has it's impact, so you really have to think twice, before doing something, also the setting itself, unlike many other rpgs it's not traditional medieval fantasy European setting but rather more ancient Roman-Egyptian, all of these makes this game really unique 10/10 | This game is quite fun in it's own unique way. It's difficult, but that enables it to be enjoyable.

What do I mean by that? Well, the game can be beaten in around 10-12 hours, but what's different about AOD is that there's dozens of different choices you can make and characters you can build that take you into different branches throughout it's run time.

In a way, the game almost plays like a hardcore choose your own adventure. It lends itself to experimentation and multiple playthroughs. You might die a lot, but the more you play and mess around with different story paths and builds, the more you'll discover how to beat fights that you aren't meant to win, and the more you'll learn how to ultimately survive this bleak and desolate adventure Iron Tower has created.

The graphics may be dated, but truthfully they didn't bother me. The type of person most likely to play this game, I believe, likely grew up with much older RPGs and won't be bothered by the mediocre 3d visuals."

На практике же получилось, что крен в сторону симуляторов, в которых победа зависит от навыка вождения, и поощрение столкновений, вносящих хаос в турнирную таблицу,  - это 2 противоречащих друг другу элемента как минимум при отсутствующем адекватном балансе уровня сложности. 

На среднем уровне сложности играть попросту не интересно - ИИ толком не способен составить конкуренцию. На уровне сложности «эксперт» до определённого момента можно играть в целом комфортно, за редким исключением борьба за победу идёт до пересечения финишной ленты, хотя уже тут начинает раздражать сам факт наличия столкновений как фактор неожиданности, т. к. при желании победить столкновения с другими автомобилями по возможности лучше не допускать и идти на таран стоит только в случае 100%-ной уверенности улучшения позиции в заезде. 

Этот самый «определённый момент» - начало предпоследнего чемпионата, с которого начинается совершенно адовый хардкор. Один вылет с трассы в результате столкновения с соперником - и смысла этот заезд продолжать дальше нет, т. к. отставание станет непреодолимым и боты, которые займут первые пару мест, далее до финиша с редким исключением будут ехать как по рельсам. Ни разу не столкнуться с местными ботами-камикадзе, которые сами впечатаются в ограждение на трассе и тебя за собой утянут, практически невозможно. Тут уже наличие столкновений как одна из базовых игровых механик Wreckfest начинает просто бесить. И становится понятно, насколько важным столпом геймдизайна FlatOut было нитро-ускорение, которое часто помогало в этой ситуации достаточно быстро вернуться в борьбу, и насколько критичным является его отсутствие во Wreckfest. Также отказ от этой механики привёл к существенному снижению динамики заездов.

Избавившись от ряда элементов FlatOut, от того же нитро-ускорения и безумных мини-игр вроде дартса, в которых водитель выступает в качестве дротика, Bugbear не смогла найти им адекватную замену, в результате чего от Wreckfest со временем просто устаёшь. Нет по сути ничего кроме кольцевых гонок и demolition derby. По замыслу разработчиков разбавить это уныние и однообразие должно было небольшое количество уникальных соревнований типа demolition derby на нестандартных транспортных средствах вроде комбайнов или заезда на трёхколёсной тачке против пары десятков автобусов, но играть в это часто также не особо интересно. 

А теперь к плюсам. Это автомобили. Их много, они все классные и отличаются по управлению в зависимости от типа привода и других технических характеристик. Уровень разрушения объектов на трассе ожидаемо высок. Графика соответствует современным стандартам.

Wreckfest более реалистична, чем FlatOut,  и в то же время более скучна, и конкретно на данный момент со всеми дополнениями выглядит скорее как заготовка для хорошей игры - контента достаточно, но необходима пересборка и доработка игровых механик. Надеюсь, что вторая часть получится более цельной и отполированной игрой. 

В Стиме, к сожалению, до сих пор отсутствует возможность оставить нейтральную оценку и, т. к. максимальная скидка на полное издание составляла чуть больше 60%, то отзыв будет отрицательный. Со скидкой 80% и более попробовать игру однозначно стоит.  | Fun destruction derby game with realistic physics and damage. | Boring AF.

Sonuç olarak, yaklaşık 1 saat kadar iyi bir hikayeye şahit oldum diyebilirim. | Информацию об игре получила из топа ""самых необычных хорроров"". Презентовали ее там, как ""вы в ожидании своей жены, но оказывается она не та, кем кажется"" и все в таком духе. Заинтересовало. Да и давно я не щекотала себе нервишки.
Первые несколько минут была сильно напряжена - а вдруг внезапно что то выскочит или раздастся резкий звук? Перед тем, как кликать на что либо, напрягала булки. Но игра приятно удивила. Никаких тебе бу-моментов и скримеров. 
Я методично прокликивала предметы, читая комментарии главного героя, до моментов, пока они не начинали снова повторяться. И так переходила от предмета к предмету, и снова, и снова, и так далее... И вроде это даже становилось немного скучным, но тяга к открытию сей тайны меня не отпускала - вроде все же хорошо у молодых, в чем же конфликт? 
Когда сюжет начал не то что бы меняться, но показывать себя с другой стороны, я по настоящему втянулась. Стала замечать некоторые нюансы - [spoiler]странная бутылка, которая остается без комментариев, но там мелькает имя жены гг; несколько капель крови на ковре, которые к концу игры превращаются в лужицу; изменившийся текст стиха в рамке и тд[/spoiler]. Не лихо интриговало.
И первый жуткий момент наконец то проявил себя - [spoiler]я до последнего ожидала резкого пробуждения трупа в шкафу[/spoiler]. С мыслью ""а, я так и думала, что [spoiler]он убил свою жену и благополучно про это забыл[/spoiler]"" уже не ждала никаких твистов. А зря!
Кажется, я и так много спойлерила, поэтому подведу итог - игра мне понравилась, вернула меня атмосферно к таким шедеврам, как ""Шорох"" и ""Дорогая Эстер"". А после того, как я узнала, что есть еще несколько упущенных мной игровых моментов, то даже думаю перепройти это чудо как нибудь еще раз. 
Чистокровным хоррором игру назвать сложно, но немного жути она все таки наводит. Это небольшая, немного грустная, но интересная история. Естественно, не для всех.
 | It's a good short game that's ambiguous enough to have you going straight to the discussion boards afterwards to read people's theories and interpretations of what just happened.  Story is well done, and voice acting is adequate.

Everyone will likely experience a slightly different game depending on what you interact with and observe.

Game consists of wondering around a cabin trying to piece together the story by clicking on things to reawaken memories, and those memories can change depending on the context and progression of what you've learned/remembered.

Again, I enjoyed it.  If it sounds interesting to you, give it try knowing that it's well done."

76561198025344110,291410,Duelyst,23.1,"Free To Play, Indie, Strategy",7,"When it comes to Duelyst, the comparison with Hearthstone is easily made. The way you earn cards is the same, the ranked system is the same, the mana system is the same and the way classes work is the same, complete with special power.

However, there's a few very key differences between the two games that make Duelyst less random and, to me at least, more fun: The board on which you play as well as the ability to replace a card from your hand once per turn.

The board in combination with the various cards makes for some really deep and satisfying tactical play that allows you to bend the game to your favour with smart decisions. Every turn the board looks different as there's so much going on and every turn has a very large amount of decisions that you can make. I really enjoy this the most as a fervent tactical turn-based gamer. If you like the combat in XCOM and Age of Wonders 3, you will find lots to love here.

Other plusses are the quick matchmaking, the active developers, the gorgeous pixel art and animations and the large amount of interesting lore.

I am personally not a fan of random stuff (which is why I stopped playing Hearthstone) and to me Duelyst strikes the perfect balance between randomness and tactics. Highly recommended! | Abosultely love this game! The strategy needed due to the infinite possibilities between the game board, placement of ""cards"", and of course the kick @$$ pixel graphics!!  A very satisfying game that could easily be played and enjoyed without spending a penny of ""real money"".  The daily quests (and free card) can get you enough gold to buy spirit orbs (card packs), gauntlet tickets (arena/draft play) and bloodborn orbs (card packs with cards you DONT have!).  Yes, if you get a crate you need a key to open it which costs $4.99.. BUT they did recently implement a ""common crate"" key reward for 15 quests completed in a month (easy).  However, if you are worried that you will be missing out on items due to not wanting to buy crates they are mostly filled with cosmetic items with 1 card here and there so they are not required to complete your card collection. The last thing I want to touch on, which is one of my favorites, is the fact that each ""faction"" or class does not only have 1 type of general that has the same hero power no matter the skin or avatar.  There are multiple general (main hero/""face"") options for each faction AND your general always has at least 2 attack and can  move around the board like a chess piece, the same as your minions, instead of just being your avatar with a set power that never moves or defends themself without a weapon equipped.

To get the FULL experience and really find out I suggest you JUST PLAY IT.  Nothing to lose since it is F2P, the system requirements are low, and if you want to get a free spirit orb (or just 100 gold) use my referral code ""gdaddanyt"" and friend me to play some matches!! :) | i like the art work and you can't complain about the gameplay really. sure there are some people with awesome cards or decks, but its all about the strategy. it makes you think and it doesnt get boring. if it does, you can always come back to it later and appreciate the workers who put effort into making this game awesome. | Please support Chinese

Tactics are varied but sadly the game seem to awards you more for bumrushing than taking a more clinical approach. Still you can play it however you feel and story is compelling enough to keep it moving, and being moving in places too.

 All of this underscored with a beautiful soundtrack and aesthetic it's worth giving a try. I strongly recommend bashing your head against a wall first time through and finding ways to a rank and seeing what secrets (Enemy Aces and hidden recruits) you can uncover then using what you learned to smash it on new game plus.

 Only real problems I can think of are a few missions where ambushes are lobbed on you via trigger points you had no way of knowing existed. Some of the mechanics in a couple missions are poorly/timed obscurely too. But this only happens a couple of times throughout and you can generally save yourself from any of these situations. | VERY GOOD GAME, JANE OP. 
wish the missions were better designed tho. Lot of the missions require constant save scumming just cause they are not explained properly. | The content of the game is actually really good, but the game crashes when I switch from ‘headquartes’ to ‘book mode’.

However, I'm not the only one who has this problem with the game
and in fact this problem seems to have existed for years. 
It's a real shame, but I don't want to support a product that requires the player to solve problems that should actually be solved by the developers. | Les miches d'Alicia miam miam.

[h2]📝 Sum-Up[/h2]
[i]Star Trek Online offers an authentic Trek experience wrapped in an aging MMO framework. While the core space combat and story content shine, aggressive monetization and technical issues hold it back. Best approached as a casual single-player Trek game with optional multiplayer elements, rather than a full-fledged MMO investment.[/i]

[h2]📖 In-Depth Analysis[/h2]

[h3]🌍 Core Gameplay[/h3]
The game splits between space and ground combat, with space being the clear highlight. Ship-to-ship battles capture the tactical feel of Trek combat, allowing for meaningful build customization and strategy. Ground combat, unfortunately, feels like an afterthought with dated mechanics and poor AI. The story missions effectively blend both elements but clearly favor space encounters.

[h3]👥 Monetization & Progression[/h3]
Here's where things get complicated. While technically playable for free, the game aggressively pushes premium purchases. Top-tier ships often cost $30+ each, with some rare variants reaching hundreds of dollars on the player market. Free players can eventually earn premium currency through grinding, but the time investment is substantial. Inventory space, character slots, and quality-of-life features are also paywalled.

[h3]⚔️ Content & Longevity[/h3]
The story content is extensive and well-written, featuring authentic Trek storylines and voice acting from series actors. Regular updates add new episodes and seasonal events. However, endgame content largely revolves around repeating Task Force Operations and grinding reputation systems. The PvP scene is minimal, with most players focusing on PvE content.

[h3]🔩 Technical Performance[/h3]
Running on an aging engine, STO shows its technical limitations. Server performance is inconsistent, with frequent lag and rubber-banding issues. The UI feels dated and can be overwhelming for new players. While the game runs on modest hardware, it doesn't perform as smoothly as its age would suggest.

[h3]🎵 Atmosphere & Authenticity[/h3]
When it comes to capturing the Star Trek universe, STO excels. From accurate ship models to familiar locations and sound effects, the game nails the franchise's atmosphere. The writing respects Trek lore while adding its own contributions to the universe. Character customization is extensive, allowing players to create their perfect Starfleet officer.

[h2]⭐ Final Verdict[/h2]
Star Trek Online is best viewed as a free Star Trek game with MMO elements rather than a traditional MMO. For Trek fans, the authentic universe representation and story content make it worth trying. However, players should approach with caution regarding monetization - the game constantly tempts you to spend, with some premium ships costing more than several AAA games combined.

The ideal way to play is treating it as a casual single-player game, enjoying the story content and occasional events without getting caught up in the endgame grind or ship collection aspects. The free content provides hundreds of hours of entertainment, but trying to ""catch up"" or compete at endgame will either require significant financial investment or grinding that would make the Ferengi proud.

Recommended for: Star Trek fans willing to overlook technical issues and aggressive monetization
Not Recommended for: Players seeking a modern MMO experience or those sensitive to microtransaction pressure | I have played this on and off for over a decade. I enjoy getting some Star Trek content, looking at the cool ships and managing my crew. | When this game was released it was good. Now it's too woke to enjoy. | great game to kill time | bien"

I initially thought the girls all looked a bit similar but its quickly clear that each has a deliberately very different personaility from each other.  You get to be their hero - and why not.  I'll not say too much but the ending was good and leaves you wanting to buy the next game in the storyline - having saidf that, this one is plenty long enoufgh for a good enjoyable playthrough spo its not a cheap teaser so you buy the next, its a great game in its own right. | For a free game this is surprisinly high quality. The combat is challenging (if you want) and fun. The soundtrack also is beautiful and very fitting in many scenes, though there are a few were it doesnt mach the tone of the scene but only a few. Characters are interesting and quite likeable. Ships and ryders designs are very well done. Overall a must play for lovers of strategy games and space operas. | I downloaded this when it first came out, played for 17 minutes and then stopped for years. Then I was bored and decided to play it again. I had a great time. What an intense ending.

The art is poor, though to be fair this is a free indie game. There's not many event CGs and most of the times you just have a background and characters in their standard standing position behind the dialogue screen, whose speaker is hard to follow because the name and the dialogue are separated so far apart. If they changed the dialogue box color for each character, like brown for Ava and red for Asaga, it would have been much better.

The gameplay is... laggy? The attack animation is very basic and takes quite long, and I skipped them a lot, but there's no transition or anything. When you click to skip an animation, the screen pauses for a second and then you're already on the next phase. There's no sliding to close the scene or screen fading out to black and opens up to the next scene. This is particularly annoying during the enemy's turn as you may want to skip a lot of enemy's animation.

The voice actors are alright. The dialogues aren't voiced and they only speak a few lines during battle. I especially like Ava's voice actor, but Icari's out-of-nowhere tsundere lines are simply horrible.

So why did I give a thumbs up? It's the well-written story. The conflict the main character is having actually feels rough, heavy and difficult. It's not a story about choosing which girl to date or anything cheap like that. It's about what kind of leader you want to be. You have a ship to protect. Your morals and professionalism are crossing each other, and the romance just makes it even harder. I only care for one of the girls, but maybe that's just me being me rather than the other romance being poorly written. The story builds up to an AMAZING ending, I'm telling you.

I won't spoil anything, but GOD DAMN I'm glad I chose the right option (for me) on that final choice. IT'S SO GOOD! | Oh well, I downloaded this one for the waifus, but, surprisingly enough, I found the gameplay part to be quite immersive and challenging, if a bit unpolished. The plot is your standard space opera...with battle spacefaring waifus (too bad there's no real way to pursue a romantic relationship with one of them - the plot is more or less linear in this department). As for the production values, they aren't anything special, but more than adequate for a free game. Overall, a solid experience which got me interested in the pay-to-play sequel. | So for anime fans its fair, but for people that actually want good gameplay its pathetic. There are limited choices to make in the storyline and the battles, which are the majority of the game, are pathetically designed.

The difficulty settings say the default is the way the game is designed to be played, great but i like harder challenges. So I played on hard... well the SECOND mission it is not possible to surivive until TURN 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! with simple luck, and getting that luck seems to be about a 50/50 chance.

because it is only the second mission means there are no particular stategies you can do to survive longer, it comes down to nothing other than iff the enemy hits you or misses on their turns. So what is the point of this? it's utterly pathetically broken as strategic combat."
76561198025344110,316010,Magic Duels,117.88333333333334,"Free To Play, Strategy",36,"A little background, I am both a big fan of the 'free to play' model as well as the Magic The Gathering card game.
I've been playing Magic for about four years now.
I've owned a few of the other digital game versions as well as having a few competitive decks in real life as well.

It's been no secret that many people have found the digital series to be pretty hit or miss. I don't know what Wizard's of The Coast does to miss the boat so hard. But I'll first put this review into a technical and then a business sense:

What works about the game:
-Bare bones, the game launches, plays, has a GUI and from what I've seen as of February, very little bugs. It's a smooth experience to start and once you get into the interface it's an enjoyable segue into the game.
-The music as always is top notch. I have yet to see anyone lodge a complaint against the music
-Fair art direction. The cards already have art that they have on file so it's hard to say that they really go out of their way with the art on the cards. However, the 3D cutscenes don't quite match the style of the cards and come off more as a Nickelodeon spinoff of Magic; which, depending on your preference, may be a good thing.
-The deck builder that everyone's been asking for is here. People complain about it not featuring a 'search by name' function. But I truly don't care. If you can remember the picture it takes all of about two seconds. And even if you unlock all the cards, it doesn't hurt to give your other options a browse while you flip to the card you want.

What doesn't work-
Now, before I get into the blemishes, it should be said that I generally enjoy the game but a review in my book is to tell people whether or not the product is worth investing in.
-The RNG. The point of the RNG being so poor is obviously an incentive to get you to buy more and more boosters. Hopefully with your own money. An easy way to observe this is to play the story mode decks. The 'challenge' often doesn't come from having a winnable deck and being forced to outthink your opponent's cards. It's redrawing, and restarting the duel over and over and over until you get a really good hand, (Hopefully with good draws afterward) and sometimes even then, some duels I found were almost impossible to win unless the opponent suffered from several bad draws.
-The Free To Pay model. Now, as I said, I love Free to Play. That's an awesome step forward with games with a competitive environment. I'll talk more about that in a second. But the problem here is that in the competitive side of the game, there's a huge incentive put on buying better cards than everyone else. Keep buy buy buying and hope your RNG gets you better cards than the other guy. A little RNG isn't bad, it keeps things interesting. However, when the incentive is to force the player to spend money when they would rather play with skill, then it's a waste of development time as you'll be seeing diminishing returns on your usage of those features.

What's just in the middle?
Well, between good and bad there's a few things that just sort of fall by the wayside.
-The free cards you earn are not very competitive.
Grinding for better cards can be fun. However, it shouldn't be done in the multiplayer against people with better cards, or at the very least not left to RNG boosters. Not neccessarily saying that the cards offered from the story should be perfectly competitive, but at least enough (if you've completed the whole story) to be able to play against starting level duelists.
-Lack of dynamic matchmaking
As far as I can tell, there's not really any matchmaking algorithms in place to match you with people at your skill level. You seem to be matched with just whoever happens to be playing. This results often in playing against other players with much better or much worse cards than you rather than someone who offers a challenge and a fun game.
-Lack of players
I don't know how many people actually play this game. But I'm judging that not a lot do from how long it can take to matchmake. I guess many people would just rather play the hard-format card game.

Ways to fix it really simply-
1.) First fix and probably most important: specifically two modes that I think will make the game even worth installing-
-Team battle: Basically, five players on each team (5v5) or (4v4) or (3v3) duel it out with premade competitive decks (similar to picking a hero in Dota, each deck has unique themes and abilities and once picked, can't be picked by the enemy team).
This is going to be the main draw of the game. Teams can use game chat to speak to eachother, and make tactical decisions. Suddenly there's a team dynamic, and it's even better than just playing 1v1 with a friend.
-Free battles: These are the current gametypes but reworked. #2 will talk about how to improve this mode. These are duels using decks that you've assembled yourself using the cards that are in the game. However, there can be certain rules applied:
Legacy, Modern, etc.

2.)Observe functioning Free to play systems: perhaps some of the best and most marketably viable free to play models are actually on Steam. Team Fortress and Dota 2 come with their own brand of users and you take them or leave them. Magic is much the same. However to make Magic work as an online game, all the content of the game needs to be free and readily available with balancing patches to control the meta game.
The reason why this works: players can spend more time on the game getting better, and more competitive with the game. Switching the content you want to buy to cosmetic, makes the game more worth playing.

3.) By switching the focus to cosmetic, people invest more time into the game. As they invest, they spend more. I hate to say it, but Dota found the magic formula. You spend X amount of hours and as X+fun=Financial investment.
Now you may say, but that still applies to this game! However, consider that because it's also pay to win RNG, you've got to face facts and admit that you've also got, X+fun-(loss x loss conditions)=fincancial investment. The greater the amount of losses, the less likely that user is to spend money on anything in the game. Nobody except a very small handful of people with huge egos will buy boosters just to compete in a pay to win game. It's very niche. The rest of the people willing to buy are hardcore magic fans who are already likely to just buy hard copies of cards.

Ultimately Wizards is in no financial trouble. However, they are walking away from a lot of money with this particular online game. By tweaking their approach by a bit, their financial rewards could be greater.

Players however, if you are a huge Magic fan then you'll love that the game is free to play, but may grow tired of the monotonous grinding for boosters and long loss streaks in attempts to get better cards with less frustrating outcomes.
If you're not a fan of Magic, but a fan of card games looking to install one on steam, then try it out.
If you're not a fan of Magic and can take or leave a card game, then pass. There are plenty of other, (better) free to play games out there.

If the game is updated to a state where it adresses some of its core issues, then I will happily update this review. | bonjour a toute l'équipe , je me prénomme nadège je suis maman et je suis atteinte d'une maladie qui m'oblige a rester alliter et j'avoue que magic me fait passer des heures agréable et m'occupe bien ...donc pour cela je vous remercie tous ... cepentdant les petits hics de magic sont : les decs de départ devrais etre dissociés d'avec les dec d'aide constructeur pour les confirmée et j'avous que se systeme d'aide mais souvent précieux mais je retrouve souvent mes anciens jeux ....le deuxieme hic que je rencontre c'est avec les mauvais joueurs en effet quand ils n'ont pas de jeux ils font tourner le chrono jusqu'à la fin je pense que pour ce genre de technic vous devriez mettre en place un chrono dégréssif comme ca plus ils attendent sur le chrono ben le second tour leurs chrono et plus rapid ou plus cour bref voilà mes opinions je vous remercie une nouvelle fois et faite que votre jeu dure toujours car je l'adore amitié a tous .........      nadège | I recently started getting back into magic after being inactive for around 15 years. However, other than standard tournaments, I don't have many opportunities to play against other players, so I figured I needed an online version of magic to practice. Magic duels is OK to get back into the mechanics and see what other people play, but other than that, it's a HUGE disappointment:

- Insane grind. buying boosters as a poor kid in the 90ies (p2w in its pure form) was more fun.

- Stupid deck restrictions: rares 2x, uncommons 3x (to keep serious players away or p2w low?)

- Strange format: not pure standard, balance seems off ( banned smuggler's copter still being played, too many cheap removal spells...)

- Terrible connectivity: connection losses all the time, dropped players get replaced by AI and most of the time, you have to beat the AI in order to not receive a loss, alt+tab is all it takes to get disconnected, possibly lots of room for exploits. Lags are so hard that often you can't hit the stop button to react to your opponent, which defeats the whole purpose of playing magic. 

- No possibility to interact with other players: no chat, no trade, nothing. Which might be wise, because...

- The duels community equals the bottom of the magic community. You won't find many good matches, real magic fans are probablly somewhere else to be found. Often enough, playing a removal spell is all that it takes for your opponent to pull the plug and let the AI take over.... which surprisingly often leads to the AI coming back hard and winning a lost match... and then there are these assholes just waiting everytime as long as the timer allows (playing a land after waiting for 1 minute) to make YOU unpatient and disconnect, giving them a default win.

- Always playing against the same decks. Right now: red burn, topters, green ramp, sphinx tutelage. boring.

- The campaigns are a joke. The way they try to tell stories is just unworthy of the magic universe. It's nothing but still images and written dialouge, combined with a muted 90ies-style render-cutscene at the end of each campaign. And the stories are just boring. It rather ruins the unvierse for me...

- Presentation is rudimentary at best. Graphics are just the cards, a boring table, generic FX like fireballs and lightnings... even tablets could do better. There is only 1 music track playing throughout the whole game and it will drive you insane after the 2nd loop.

I honestly can't find a reason to play this other than getting a very blury first impression of what magic the gathering is and that it's probably best to stay away from it lol. Do yourself a favor and play real magic or Xmage. I honestly can't understand the people giving this a thumps up. Probably the kind of people going to McDonalds when they're hungry and liking every shit on facebook... | 为什么都要和炉石做对比，这明明就是鼻祖好么。

[h1]ACTUAL REVIEW[/h1]

I've invested a decent amount of time and more money than I care to admit in this game, so I feel its time to give it an honest review.

[u]Pros[/u]
+ Teaches you how to play MTG, So it's a good game to pick up for new players along with returning players needing a refresher.
+ Atmospheric campaigns that introduce you to each new set while also earning you coins.
+ Game limits your collection and deck to only one mythic, 2 rares, 3 uncommon, and 4 common cards of any individual card. This creates an artificial buffer and prevents players with too much money/time from building crazy decks that will dominate the metagame. 
+ Finite amount of cards for each set, meaning eventually you will have every card in the set. With older sets going on sale every so often to help build your collection more quickly.
+ 150 coin price tag is very fair for a booster of 6 cards. Winning a multiplayer match earns you 30 coins plus any bonuses for completing weekly and daily quests means you can unlock at least one new booster every day with a decent deck.
+ Every set since Origins has been included, and they continue to add new blocks as they come out, with some card exceptions that would be too complicated to code in a vs format.
+ All the fun of FNM, minus the smell.

[u]Cons[/u]
- Mana tapping system needs work, though there is a mana tapping key, often times it either doesn't work correctly or is just too clucky to use in the limited time you have to play your turn. Nothing is more frustrating than a match going sideways because the game chose to tap the wrong mana for you.
- Game is very buggy at times, I had to leave a match I was winning because the game refused to unzoom a card and blocked my view of the battlefield. Another time, the game froze on the ""opponent watching animations screen"" and it cost me the match. 
- Game has been out long enough for there to be enough ""auto include"" mythics and rares between all the sets to make it frustrating to play vs battles at times. I've run out of fingers and toes for the amount of times I've seen ""Combustable Gearhulk"" in any deck that has red in it.
- Game really favors the constructed format of the game, which can be jarring/frustrating for players that like to play limted formats like draft, sealed, and pauper. 
- Plainswalkers dominate the game. Some are pretty benign, but you'll see the frustrating ones enough to make you walk away from the game at times. (I personally haven't liked plainswalkers when they were introduced years ago, At least back then they were reasonable being 6 drops with something along the lines of ""+1: Target creature gets +1/+1"" not 4 drops with ""+3: Make game unplayable."")
- No In-game chat with other players. (I would probably get banned if we actually had this, I'm humble enough to know I can be a sore winner/loser.)
-All the frustration of FNM, minus the smell.

I really like Magic duels, but I also hate it just as much. I've lost count of how many times I've walked away from the game, never to play again, just to find myself back again in another duel 30 minutes later. I honestly think you need to be a little bit of a masochist to enjoy this game. 

If you like MTG, you'll feed that itch with this game. If you want to learn MTG, this game is a good jumping off point. If you want to stare blankly at the screen in a silent burning rage that could fuel a thousand suns, this game is for you."

Ocena końcowa: 
11/10 | Gerçekten bir moda göre olağanüstü diyebilirim . Bu kadar zaman nasıl görmedim bu modu anlamış da değilim . Adeta Portal 3 tadında . Ücretsiz olmasına da ayrı bir şaşırmıştım . Portal 1 ve 2 den dolayı aklınızda kalmış soru işaretlerini tamamen siliyor . Bölümleri serinin diğer oyunlarına göre zor diyebilirim . Sanırım Wheatley'den dolayı bu ""Core""lara pek ısınamamıştım . Bu mod ise bize bambaşka ve yardımsever bir core olan Virgil'i sunuyor . Oyunun sonundaki bir detay ise Portal 2 den hatırlarsanız eğer Wheatley bizi uyandırdığında ""Dokuzdokuzdokuzdokuz... gündür uykudasınız."" gibi bir söz söylemişti. Fazla spoiler vermek istemem ama oyunda var olan bir makineden ötürü böyle olduğunu anlıyoruz ve son kısımda dikkatli dinlerseniz ""Dokuzdokuzdokuzdokuz... gündür uykudasınız."" diyerek Portal 2 ye bağladığını görebilirsiniz . Oyun Aperture Science nin ilk zamanlarını anlatıyor . Cave Johnson'ın tuz madenlerini aldığı zamanları . Hatta ilk başta Aperture Science'ye bir tren içinde giriyoruz . Bunun da Half Life'da Black Mesa'ya tren ile girişimize yapılan bir gönderme diyebilirim . Portal silahımız ise ikinci oyundan daha geçmişte oynadığımız için dolayısıyla biraz daha değişik . Sonuç olarak hikaye açısından bir mod olmasına rağmen önceki oyunlar ile bağlantısı çok yüksek . Ayrıca oyun standalone . Portal dosyalarınıza zarar vermeden ayrı bir oyun olarak kütüphanenize geliyor . Eğer Portal 2 niz varsa ve bu modu indirmemişseniz bu modu yüklemenizi şiddetle tavsiye ediyorum . | It's hard to give a thumbs down to something that's both free and presented so well, but alas, the more I play, the more I dislike it, even as a get better at solving the puzzles as I've learned what's expected of me and the typical tropes. Seriously, I'm practically flying through the levels now, and yet still feel more exhausting than fun. This is compounded by the poor humor that's an inferior version of the original, coupled with bad voice acting that you're absolutely bombarded with, and also boring, amateurish music that in some cases doesn't even loop properly. I'm actually amazed at the effort though, that a free fan made mod actually went to such lengths to write new (albeit unoriginal and amateur) lines and have them acted out, but once the novelty wears thin you'll begin to find each line of dialougue more and more grating. 

Plenty of other thumbs downers have touched on the difficulty in solving the puzzles, all the while managing to make themselves sound like maybe they're the ones who are just bad at puzzles. I think it's more that the bar that this franchise has set is incredibly high, and this feels poorly designed in comparison. It isn't only that, it's in the way the puzzles are challenging that makes them feel like drudgery. Almost every puzzle has you reaching the exit only to have you turn around and realize you need to bring with you all those boxes that got you there, which just feels cheap compared to the original where most of the time getting to the exit meant success. Puzzles here feel confined and super restricted to a very narrow way of solving, whereas in portal 2 you're having fun learning new puzzle mechanics and flying around playing with physics, here there are no new mechanics so what they've done is tried to up the challenge instead. The original also had excellent pacing, mixing up the puzzle solving runs with the story/adventure parts. In this, the puzzle sections seem to drag on, especially when you solved something tough and see that you're on puzzle 2 of 12.  

Overall this is an awesome effort, I just really can't wrap my head around the fact they had multiple playtesters that were ok with the tediousness of the puzzles. It's a well presented addition to the portal story plagued by lackluster voicework/music and puzzles that just aren't fun. | This game should (and in my mind is) be part of the Portal mythos.

I remember not being able to join friends and after a few games, I decided the game wasn't for me and just another clone.

Being bored and only seeing games with no depth in gameplay and just essentially imitating the original MOBA/FPS formula, I decided to give Gigantic another shot after it came out for Steam. I'm originally from DotA and MMORPG pvp-style games, so having a MOBA-esque theme with third-person gameplay actually fit my needs.

Some elements I definitely like about the game are the strategy involved, artstyle, animations, colorful particles. 
I mean your nexus/core actually jumps to the other side of the field to crush the enemy nexus/core? WTF. These Guardians are huge and makes you feel right there on the battlefield. Not to mention the fact that Clash mode completely changes the map.

On the surface, the game seems pretty simple. You lay minions on control points, you kill other people, and you win the game by killing the enemy boss. What you don't see are the strategic elements in the game. Some examples being:

[*]What limited creature do I summon on this point?

[*]Do I spend my focus on upgrading the creature to an adult or keep it so I can use my ultimate?

[*]One of the Guardians (Boss) is going on a rampage, do I defend/attack the Guardian or do I attack a control point to put more points into the next round?

Then you add on to the defending, healing, sprinting, dodging, engaging, killing, wounding fast-paced part of the game, it becomes quite immersive. Seriously, this game is [b]fast-paced AF[/b] (game time and movement speed). I don't think I've played a game as fast as this. You sprint literally everywhere.

Anyway, back on topic. Motiga isn't a big company, but they seem to be on track with feedback and updates. 
Whether this game gets popular in the future, I definitely plan to stick with this game. A game formula that I actually enjoy with amazing art is rare for me.

I mean this game is F2P. Give it a shot and try it out for yourself and mold your own thoughts. What do you have to lose?"
76561198025344110,329110,Gems of War - Puzzle RPG,41.86666666666667,"Action, Adventure, Casual, RPG, Strategy, Free To Play",22,"A very fun but very poorly balanced game. I want to cover four quick points.

[h1]Lack of balance part 1 - the reason for nearly all negative reviews here (and a workaround!)[/h1]

In Gems of War the primary gameplay is broken down into games you either play against AI created teams in a variety of scenarios, or in games you play against real teams created by other players that the AI controls. The balance for the AI created teams is a bit messed up. It starts out trivially easy but scales up incredibly rapidly and caps at around level 50. The problem is that you'll soon find yourself unable to effectively compete against the AI teams. At this point it seems lots of people decide it's either go pay-to-win or call it quits.

There's a much better solution. Go play PvP. PvP will pair you against more fairly matched teams. You'll get better rewards and be able to continue leveling up your cards and team. Since the AI team scaling stops at level 50, by the time you come back to it - it'll be a cake walk. It's counter intuitive but yeah. Start by playing against AI teams and then after that do PvP until you're ready to face the AI...


[h1]Lack of balance part 2 - the fun is strictly capped[/h1]

The cards in the game are in no way balanced or is there any major attempt to balance them. Rarer cards tend to do everything less rare cards do... and more... and better. The problem is that this strictly caps the room for creative team design. You are left to take your best/rarest cards, add a mana generator (turning gems of a certain color into the one your 'win card(s)' need), and that's pretty much going to crush any other team you could make. This is really fun at first when you're regularly finding more rarer cards and your decks are constantly shifting and changing in new and interesting ways. But as you start to collect most of the top cards - the fun starts to stop. Suddenly there's not much to look forward to, and since less rare cards tend to just be worse in every possible way there's not really any sort of room for creative team design. 

[h1]Monetization - you can, but don't need to and I wouldn't want to[/h1]

The major 'grab' in this game is chasing the carrot of rarer cards. With real money you can buy these cards - or at least keys to chests that give you a very high chance of getting them. However, everything relevant that you can buy you can earn through regular play as well. I actually find this a bit frustrating. I'd love to toss the developers a few dollars since I've gotten a lot of enjoyment out of this game, but just about everything you can buy is going to just decrease the hours of enjoyment you can have with the game. A recurring problem with free to play games that don't just focus on aesthetics purchases.

[h1]Overall - Great game.[/h1]

Overall yeah, give it a go.

Вторая половина февраля. Реальность давила своей холодной безысходностью, и мне нужно было на время уйти в другую. Отвлечься на пару дней, прогнать не дающие покоя мысли. И тогда мне на глаза попалась игра, которую я заметил ещё несколько месяцев назад, но всё время откладывал. Пришёл её черёд. Ничто не предвещало беды. Простоватая графика, ненавязчивое музыкальное сопровождение, и… текст. Я всегда как-то сторонился жанра визуальных новелл. Не то, чтобы я их не любил, просто проходил мимо. Мне казалось, что они не смогут обеспечить достаточной степени погружения, не смогут унести в виртуальный мир, в который будет хотеться возвращаться, и из которого не захочется уходить. Тогда я ещё не знал, что меня ждёт. И безропотно вошёл в эту дверь.

Зима. Комната, темноту которой лишь слегка разгоняет свет работающего монитора. Я уже начал играть? И вот декорации меняются. Лето, пионерский лагерь. И лица людей, которые вызывают какую-то странную симпатию. Небольшой островок реальности, выдранный из сурового и жестокого мира, где нет места злу, жестокости и боли. Ведь нет? И проходят дни, а эти люди становятся всё ближе. Проходит первая неделя. Что это было? Это ведь не конец? Нет. И неделя начинается снова. Новые ответы, новые вопросы. И новые детали из жизней обитателей этого мирка, которые становятся всё роднее. Проходят дни, недели… Или всего лишь часы? Время течёт незаметно. Но приходит горькое осознание: в этом мире тоже есть боль. Она скрывалась за ярким фасадом этой странной реальности. Действия несут за собой последствия. И оступившись, можно пойти не тем путём. И каждый раз снова этот автобус. Прощание, грусть, безысходность и… надежда. Куда он меня увезёт? И что будет после?

В какой-то момент я внезапно осознал, что лето закончилось. Все концовки достигнуты, в этом мире больше нечего делать. И я уже было подумал, что я смог покинуть лагерь. Но я ошибся. Не помню, как я оказался в мастерской стим. Наверное, я зашёл посмотреть. Я не собирался ни на что подписываться. И сам не заметил, как один мод всё же оказался в списке установленных. «7 дней лета». Это ведь просто ещё одна неделя, правда? Я вернусь лишь на несколько дней…

Зима стала ещё холоднее, неприветливо встречая на пороге. Туда ли я вернулся? Но вот он, знакомый автобус, ворота и две статуи. Что-то изменилось. Реальность будто перешла на какой-то новый уровень. Ещё больше глубины, ещё больше чувств, ещё больше радости и ещё больше… боли. И дни тянутся бесконечно.
Я очередной раз занимаю место в автобусе. Что ждёт впереди на этот раз? Есть ли выход на самом деле?

Мне не выбраться. Я устал. Я подумаю об этом завтра. | С жанром визуальной новеллы я познакомился благодаря этой игре. С этой игрой я познакомился осенью 2014 года благодаря скриншотам, которые выкладывали тогда в большом количестве у меня в ленте. Я удивился тому, что она от российских разработчиков из Soviet Games. Достаточно хорошее название для компании по разработке игр. От российских, вот что удивило, потому что до этого я не встречался с хорошей игрой от российских разработчиков. Тем не менее, я прошёл эту игру несколько раз и сейчас готов высказаться о ней. 
Графика. Отличная графика в стиле аниме. Очень уж красивые девушки. Особенно мне понравилась Славя: симпатичная русская светловолосая девушка с большими косами, стройная с приятными формами. Понимаю, что их рисовали, что называется, по шаблону, но всё равно вышло очень красиво. 
Озвучка. Озвучки в таких играх нет, есть только музыка. Музыка очень приятная, прям подходит под время года, когда целыми днями светит солнышко, все в лагере активно занимаются чем-то полезным и интересным. 
Сюжет. Интересный и сильно зависит от того, что вы нажмёте в качестве ответа. Действия разворачиваются во времена СССР в пионерском лагере. Лагерная тема мне стала ближе только в 19 лет, когда впервые побывал в лагере. Правда, в институтском спортивном лагере. Концовок очень много: есть хорошие, есть плохие, и есть нейтральные. Я же старался проходить на хорошие концовки, если судить по моим заработанным достижениям. Сцен много красочных и в какой-то степени романтичных. Концовка со Славей мне больше понравилась.

Но самое главное, она распространяется бесплатно, за что им плюс в карму компании. Поиграйте, не пожалеете:) | Игра которая тронула до глубины души! Прошел все концовки, но все равно открываю ее снова и сново, что бы вернуться в Совенок... Есть некоторые нарекание по поводу выбора ответов ГГ, но все это меркнет на фоне всей игры!

Случайный сон в автобусе – и вот наш герой уже в другом месте, ладно месте, времени! Кажется это СССР! Пройдет немного времени, и Вы узнаете, где же Вы очутились. То самое место из странного сна – пионерлагерь «Совёнок». Где предстоит прожить 7 насыщенных дней, либо в поисках ответов, либо же налаживая отношения с лагерем (передадим привет закону Мёрфи: поскольку все, что ни случится, во всё вас вовлекут).

Основная часть населения лагеря – девушки и два парня,[spoiler]прототипами которых стали оригинальные маскоты [/spoiler], простые девушки и парни [spoiler]или не простые?[/spoiler]. Стоит отдать должное Soviet Games, получились отлично проработанные характеры и приятная рисовка.

Благодаря тому, что движок Ren’Py имеет открытый исходный код и находится в свободном доступе, люди стали массово делать различные модификации к игре, начиная от маленьких продолжений сюжетных концовок девушек, заканчивая уже полноценно новым сюжетом, связанный с все теми же девушками, из пионерлагеря. 

[h1]Кажется. я уже не забуду[/h1]
Такое не забывается, и хочется вновь и вновь вернуться (нет, конечно, далеко не для каждого, но мой обзор – только моё субъективное мнение, не буду же я говорить за каждого). 

[h1]Теперь точно - конец[/h1]
Soviet Games все-таки смогли, не смотря на то, что фундамент для проекта был заложен еще в 2008 году, примерно, в 2010 я узнал о этом проекте на одном из форумов. А его разработка длилась аж до конечного релиза 2013 года оно того стоило, получилась отличная визуальная новелла, с приятной рисовкой, “живыми” персонажами, относительно большим выбором действий для разнообразных концовок.

76561198025344110,319630,Life is Strange - Episode 1,31.95,"Action, Adventure",60,"[b]An intimate diary tribute to the 10th anniversary of Max’s journey.[/b]

It used to be a tradition for me to play [i]Life is Strange[/i] every New Year’s Eve when visiting my childhood home. So many memories intertwine with it. Jumping up and down on the bed losing my mind after the 3Ep twist. Bugging my classmates with a basket of theories and insane lore about the game's development. Cutting my hair slowly bit by bit until it eventually resembled Max's. I learned Spanish Sahara by heart and played it non-stop on the ukulele I begged my parents to buy. Even the wall of my room was decorated in Max's style – a tradition I carry to all the homes, or the resemblance of homes, I've changed along the way. In 11th grade, I made Max’s journal from scratch, it was one of my favorite pieces in the room, taking a notable place among my own personal and school diaries. I remember playing the 4th episode on a school week until 6am and going straight to school all hyped and simultaneously out of it. When Episode 5 came out, I sobbed for two weeks! My best friend at that time and I woke up so early that day, purposefully missed school, and spent all day immersed in that final chapter – her watching a live stream and I cursing at my old computer unable to handle Max’s time jumping shenanigans; of course, taking occasional breaks for comparing our declining emotional stability. [i]Life is Strange[/i] carried me from that final school year straight to University, helping me figure out some stuff about my own life along the way; as it did to many. Every time I turn it on now it just turns into a crying fest. From love, of course. But also sorrow.

Over the years, I’ve read so many players' intimate recollections prompted by the game's content; random snippets of people’s most vulnerable life stories sprinkled over each social media platform. Simply something awoken in people of all ages and backgrounds, perhaps by the game’s mellow nostalgic aesthetics and unabashed willingness to attune to the finest memories and emotions of our hearts. It was rather pleasant to witness the resurgence of [i]LiS[/i] fandom in late 2024, collectively reminiscing on our intimate interaction with the story, the newfound change in perspectives, and the passionate desire to mutually share all the warmth we still have for its characters. 

Living through Max was foundational for me, a self-conscious girl growing into confident adulthood with innocence violently ripped away from her. It was simply an average coming-of-age process, growing up and seeing a world from a different perspective, learning to connect and empathize with those around, learning from them and finding our own flaws and desires, recognizing them and growing to be better. But also a darker experience of going through my own sexual assault, of losing my own innocence, shifting and modifying the self to perhaps be more cynical and pragmatic, of maybe seeing the world through a darker yet necessary lens. Yet, ultimately, all of it forming one unified identity that is nevertheless a beautiful landscape of variable experiences and lessons; adulthood. I will always love the character of Max dearly. I will always cry noticing the gradual change of her vibrant diary doodles to objective, subdued in color entries with each passing chapter. I will always cry for the innocent love Max finds in non-innocent circumstances. The exploration of Max’s fractured mind following the violation will always mean the world to me, back in 2015 making me feel seen and motivated to start my own tumultuous journey of healing. I will always be grateful for Don’t Nod creating this beloved gamified companion to project our own internal worries onto, our transformations, and dreams; to reach intimate answers through a bittersweet, meditative experience.

[i]Life is Strange[/i] maintains sheer gratitude and wonder for each part of our environment while not rejecting the truth of the shadows stretching over the world’s corners. Finding beauty in the industrial powers of small towns, their nature, expansion in infrastructure, transformation of beliefs, unique differing people, and their interconnected messy ties to each other: as colleagues, students, friends, lovers. Finding beauty in the contrast of lives cut short, resentments, domestic disputes, destructive truths, violence, and uncertainty of tomorrow. Creating a living, breathing town that wishes to continuously evolve, grow, and adapt to the changing population making up its geographical landscape. Rachel Amber’s character is perhaps the most compassionate interpretation of Laura Palmer’s image I have seen, Chloe’s uncensored journey of clawing through grief calls to the most helpless moments of my own 19old self, and the understanding of violence captured in a human-shaped form still wounds me deeply: of course, so much of [i]LiS[/i] was inspired by and carried love for David Lynch’s legacy.


It's not so much the content of media; over time it becomes something bigger than its key narrative points. Rather, the events it accompanied in life, the memories you associate it with. That's when stories become truly dear to the heart no matter the years passed. It simply evokes a subdued feeling, like a thread granting the privilege to time travel to your own thoughts, memories, tastes, smells, relationships, places.

I tried replaying this game in so many locations now it can be drawn onto a map, like a shi+ty road trip. But I never lasted very long, about 30 minutes before I lose my cool completely and start thinking of the hand-drawn picturesque walls of my school. Of the captured memories sprinkled over my walls. Of the path to my home from school, from my friends, from the center, from my mom's job, from the park, from the waterfront. Of the last school days and giving away my books. Of getting closer with my classmates and finally understanding how similar we are. Of looking out my window, the windows of my friends, the windows of my school – and seeing sunsets, sunrises, golden hours, whirlwinds, blizzards, screeching hot days. Of dark days. Of town spots I avoid. Of town spots I wish could stay with me. A living breathing town… trapped in hazy, fleeting pieces of memory. Out of reach, a resemblance of something that used to be, overwritten by new places and people – when it's one of the last anchors you have to that past you cannot go back to. Learning to hold the value of delicate memory, accept darkness, and cherish its lighter undertones.

Finally replaying the game after these years, I’ve been finding new connections with Arcadia Bay, of the radical shift it makes from a nostalgic warm town to a harbor of ruin. How it strongly encompasses both, yet neither. I’ve been thinking of how the geography of my town has been modified, its prior identity forever wiped away. I’ve been countering the grief of losing childhood physically and emotionally with the fleeting traces of glee that used to be. On dark days, I will always hold on to the memory of sitting on the hot-to-the-touch boulder stone with my childhood friend, giggling about our new life developments, surrounded by forestry of a quiet park and bright sun. Of looking around me and seeing kids become more expressive in their identities, unafraid to look, think, and love however they please. Of regularly visiting my school and checking in to see if the asphalt drawing we made in dedication to our class teacher has faded away, or the chamomiles covering the school’s entrance are still greeting the children. Of peaking outside from the large plants covering my mom’s windowsill and seeing the rose we have planted outside slowly rise and bloom. Of always having a prepared 2h15m playlist to accompany me on the trip to my town from the nearby big city.

Nowadays, [i]Life is Strange[/i] transports me to the hot summer days of my home. 
I will always be grateful for having a chance to time travel. | Absolutely incredible story. 10/10
Also runs on a potato so that's nice. | I've been wondering for a long time whether ""Life is Strange"" is a game I could recommend or not, since it has very positive reviews and a slew of fans. I also expected such an experience. Unfortunately, I have to admit that the game disappointed me. Don't get me wrong, I fell in love with the demo version (chapter one), which promised an elaborate crime story with several suspects and lots of decision-making. We were introduced to the characters along with our heroine (Max), as she was new to the school. It promised a story full of excitement, mystery and consequences of our choices.

Unfortunately, after purchasing the full version of the game, with all the chapters (21 hours played), the spell faded in several different ways:

1. The game turned out to be a delusion of the consequences of the choices (except for the final decision at the end - although this one is disappointing in terms of the logic of the choice and the realization of the consequences, especially in the case of one final).
 
2. The game deliberately distracts us from some characters, completely forgetting them as criminal suspects. Because of this, we are unable to gather evidence in their case. Which is then supposed to cause surprise, shock, etc. - A cheap, ineffective ploy.

3. Overly cinematic final chapters. At one point in the game, there was so much story told in interludes and stills that for most of the chapter, the player had nothing to do but minor linear activities that contributed nothing. This killed my immersion and and even more my sense of control and decision-making.

4. Little bugs. The ending cutscenes have a number of close-ups of characters talking without their mouths moving. There are so many of them that at some point it becomes uncomfortable. The time reversal system is also sometimes unintuitive and can erase a decision even though it was not intended.

**[Warning: little spoilers]**

5. Final decisions: It is supposed to arouse emotions, but whether it does so is not necessarily the case. The first ending looks good and emotional, but the second one is dull and bland. In addition, it shows that everything we did throughout the game is irrelevant to our protagonist Max (all the friendships we've made, the lives we saved, etc.). That's not how you write good endings.

6. Imbalance in the characterization of the characters. Just as most of the characters are good written (they have their own motives, secrets, behaviors and are believable), I cannot say the same about two of the main characters who should arouse sympathy - Chloe and (maybe) Warren.
The friendship between Max and Chloe is, in my opinion, completely one-sided. Chloe uses Max's skills like a toy, she doesn't accept criticism, she's explosive and I didn't get the impression that she actually cared about her friend or even respected her, her character and way of being. Thus, he forces her to engage in various activities, even though Max points out that such activities are not to her liking or even can hurt her. Despite this, Max keeps repeating wonderful words about lifelong friendship and can also create a love bond with her. The only positive aspect of Chloe's character is at the end, when she realizes all these elements and talks about them, and makes her first unselfish decision.
As for Warren, he's written strangely. He's supposed to be a geek with a crush on Max, and he basically is, but throughout the entire game I had the impression that there was something strange about him and that he was hiding something. | 沉浸感无敌，剧情不拖泥带水，就是克洛伊像个啥币，看后续剧情发展吧 | This is one of the best video game stories ever told – a true classic.

76561198025344110,409160,"Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist",0.35,"Free To Play, Indie",1,"[b]“I like work: it fascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours.” ― Jerome K. Jerome[/b]

Coming from the designer behind [i]The Stanley Parable[/i] and a young developer team, this free little game with a needlessly long name carries a similar pattern of blatant absurdity. Due to the ridiculous amount of probable effort that I'd have to put while writing the whole completion of the title each time, I'll be referring to the game simply as [i]Dr.Langeskov[/i] for the remainder of this review. Now that is settled, let me try doing this properly.

Following the example of [i]The Stanley Parable[/i], it is somewhat hard to write a review to a game that would be better played without knowing anything about it. So, if you'd like to enjoy the full experience, I'd highly recommend to stop reading and give it a try to see it for yourself. Since it already is a freeware, you won't have anything to lose rather than 15 minutes of your time.

Still here? Well then. You've asked for it. Since we've already downloaded the game, we must have intended to actually play it, right? There is one little problem though. As the game starts, we are very apologetically informed that they are unable to let us play since it is a single player game and there is already one person playing it. Apparently we have to wait for the other player to finish the game before trying it ourselves. But since the studio conditions are a bit below excellent - nope, of course there are no safety hazards! What is it you are thinking? - There is a shortage of employees in the whole place due to a recent strike. We are informed that it would all go quite swiftly if we were to help them simulate the game for the player inside. Reluctantly agreeing, we start following - or try to follow, at least - directions of the young director with a mousy voice and a British accent, who dreads that our every single action might end in a catastrophy.

As you can see, this short, 15 minute adventure is a complete parody of a developmental concept. There is no actual game here. Like that the cake was a lie, the game itself is a lie. The whole thing is a smart and somewhat enjoyable conceptual experiment that could invoke some appreciation. Certainly not a masterpiece - and not in the claim of being so anyway - and the humor isn't exceptional, but [i]Dr. Lengeskov[/i] presents you a distraction and a smirk on your face for 15 minutes: a task well done. It might be noteworthy to mention that the expected gameplay is somewhat linear contrary to [i]The Stanley Parable[/i], carrying only one possible ending. The idea is to enjoy the environment, the concept and the reactions you are having around. Very much like any joke.

Throughout your playthrough, you might want to investigate the environment, since there are items around to collect for achievements. Achievements themselves are a bit buggy though. I recommend not using the steam overlay or sending the game to tray since it may block achievements from unlocking. If all else fails, verify cache and they should trigger the next time you are meeting their conditions.

Go ahead. I know that you are already curious. It is not the wittiest kid on the block, but it is here and it is free with certain creative value. Enjoy!

Компьютерные игры, как и любая форма искусства, способны вызвать самые разные эмоции у геймера. Порой чувства бывают диаметрально противоположны, к примеру, большинство мультиплеерных забав способны вызывать одновременно, как любовь, так и ненависть, обзоры на туже «Doty 2» яркий тому пример. И подобно живописи или художественной литературе, игры способны влиять на наше мировоззрение и отношение к жизни. Конечно же, не всё. Конечно же, таких игр даже не большинство, но они встречаются. Порой же, разработчики позволяют себе такую вольность, как «ломание четвертой стены» и где герои/антигерои игры обращаются непосредственно к геймеру. Как правило, это делается в шутливой форме, как это было в «Wither 3» или происходящее вовсе превращается в шутку – «Postal 2», но порой бывают и серьезные беседы, дающие пищу для ума. Одной из таких игр была «Stanley Parable», о которой многие слышали, но не все видели. Что ж, наш сегодняшний гость позволит исправить сие досадное упущение, ведь вышел он из-под руки тех же ребят, что отвечали за «Стэнли», но при этом игра распространяется на бесплатной основе и таким образом каждый сможет приобщится к прекрасному, ну или ужасному, как повезет.

Итак, вы - компьютерная программа. Нет, конечно же, к вам будут обращаться напрямую, как к личности, но суть заключается в том, что вы программа, которая так и норовит дать сбой - потыкать в выключатель, на котором написано большими красными буквами ""Не нажимать"". Подергать закрытые двери, постучать в них ногами и недовольно надуться на неведомого кукловода, который вас туда не пускает. Ну а еще надо обязательно проверить, что можно использовать, а что нельзя, расстроив при этом своего неведомого кукловода, который не наделил нас даже банальнейшей возможностью прыгать, что уж говорить о большем?

Казалось бы, что же в этом особенного? Ведь на Steam'е имеется куча игр, которые так или иначе издеваются над геймером. Что в этой игре такого особенного? А дело тут в том, что всё было подано в шутливой форме, причем столь грамотно, что улыбка не раз и не два посетит лицо. Во всяком случае, меня эта игра заставила улыбаться, за вас все же не поручусь. Она не может похвастаться достаточно большой продолжительностью, а потому проходится куда раньше, чем начинает надоедать. Ну а еще тут есть достижения, которые кажутся легкими, но спешу предупредить - разработчики и этот момент смогли обыграть, оттого так просто вы достижения не получите. Необходимо отключить оверлей в игре и тогда и только тогда можно рассчитывать на заветные ачивменты.

6 из 10 притаившихся тигров | Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist is a short free game.
It takes approximately 15 minutes to finish it.
This game is a nice unique experience and pretty humorous.
During your way through the game you will be led by a voice, like in Stanley Parable.
The voice acting is really enjoyable.
If you have played The Stanley Parable and enjoyed the humour of it you should definitely try Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist.

XCOM 2 and WOTC are so different it is like 2 different games which makes replayability even higher. One of my favorite games. I would give 10/10 | After my 3rd attempt, I was able to beat this game, and I didn't really like it. The game is cruel, unreasonably hard and very disrespectful to player. 
At first, the game bombards you with a ton of non-skippable events, missions, messages. While you trying to figure out what's going on, they put on a timer on you with this ""Project Avatar"" thing, and you immediately feel a lot of pressure. Some missions are just crazy difficult, like those for Serpent King and Mad AI factory, and you don't expect this difficulty this early in the game.
Mid-game you finally have a chance to catch some breath and start working on some research, building and engineering, but here's the catch: the moment you get better in the game, the moment you upgrade your weapons and armour, the enemies suddenly become more powerful and armoured. You just don't have a chance to enjoy powerful things that you've made, because they quickly become just what is expected by default.
The end game comes unexpectedly, with a lot of pressure on you. It consists of two consecutive missions with no pause in between. If you got some units damaged in the first mission, you either will have to replace your best units or send them in wounded. The final mission is crazy, the amount of extremely powerful enemies is over the top, and it carries a lot of stress.
Given that the game is flawed with bugs in controls, has dumb battle mechanics that lead to absurd situations and very challenging overall even on lower difficulties, I would not recommend this game. | XCOM2の面白さを語るには、前作にして名作 XCOM: Enemy Unknown (以下XCOM:EU) と比較すると分かりやすいと思う

Steamワークショップ対応でMODも充実と欠点なし！と、損は無いのでセール時にはぜひ買ってプレイしてほしい

以上を大前提とした上で、そう⋯700時間以上もプレイ（最高難易度を最小部隊人数でクリア済）した上で私個人の見解を言わせてもらうと
XCOM:EUよりもゲーム性（ゲームとしての楽しさの意）は落ちてしまったと感じる
XCOM:EUはXCOM2よりも飽きの来る要素が多いはずなのに⋯だ！
※EUでは敵の配置が一部完全固定だったり⋯etc

繰り返し遊ぶゲームとしてみるとXCOM2の方が優秀なはずである
ではなぜ私はXCOM:EUの方がゲーム性が高いと言えるのか？
XCOM:EUのゲーム性はまるでパワプロなのだ
パワプロもメインイベントは決まった日に起こるはずなのに、何度もプレイしても楽しい

XCOM:EUではストーリーの進行と、ミッションが適切な間隔で詰まっており
兵士の計画的な育成（＝ビルドを組む楽しさ）と、時間制限（＝敵の更新／強化）
のバランスがすごい良かったのだ
そしてランダム性が少ないことが→上手くなれば、あらゆる要素を縛っても戦術で勝てる
など良い方向に働いたりした

一方でXCOM2では、多くの追加要素により楽しさも増したが、
その分ストーリーとミッションの関連性が薄れ、またタイムリミット枠の選ばれし者たちの介入は、
戦闘を長引かせる良くない要素の一つだと思う
選ばれし者自体はすごく面白いのだが、3人は多い！ゲームのかさ増しになってしまってる

ストーリーとレジスタンスの尻拭いを交互にやらされるのも間延びする原因だ
XCOM:EUでは助ける国と、見捨てる国の切り分けも緊張感を煽る良いスパイスだった
XCOM:EUでの上手くなるは「ゲームオーバーにならなければ見捨てて/切り捨ててOK」だった
XCOM2では上手くなると「滅亡カウンターがやばくなってきたから、そろそろ助けに行くか～」と、どの難易度でもなった
侵略されてXCOM:EUより悲惨なはずなのに、なんか緊張感にかけるのである
追加要素をプレイさせるために、滅亡までの時間にどうしても猶予が出来てしまったためだ
この点がゲーム性がXCOM:EUより落ちてしまったと感じる部分だ

難易度が上がると、どんどん無駄を減らすプレイングが重要で、駆け抜けるようなゲームプレイ感になるXCOM:EUと
研究や勢力や選ばれし者など、たくさんの要素からどっしり構えて戦略を練っていくXCOM2とプレイ感が違う
そしてたまたまXCOM:EUの方が私に合っていただけなのかも知れない

色々言ったがXCOM2のMODでの拡張性と、それに伴う豊富なキャラクリは本当に最高なので
みんなもお気に入りのキャラを作ってプレイしよう！

Get better Community Managers. | There was a time I would have recommended this game despite the weird light feeling ball physics! But now that a fair few of the tables original artworks have been replaced by A.I art I can no longer do so. There is also the fact that this game has been in early access now for years with no indication that they will ever finish it. If you have money to burn on buying tables in a pinball game i would recommend PinballFX instead at least they are more transparent about what they are doing with the game. | even if you apologized and reversed it back to normal, i still wouldn't support this game, i'm so sick of people trying to get away with using AI. And to all the morons arguing that AI is ''just a tool'' grow the fxxk up, people steal art, other people's likeness to make deranged porn, stealing peoples voices even down to their behavior to maximize their profit, without any consent from any of the people.

the fact you tried to get away with it really shows how rotten you've become, you're losing sight of what you want this project to be, whoever is in charge should be ashamed to represent zacarria's legacy. 

you asked earlier in your discord how to get zaccaria to a broader audience and its by working harder and actually listening to criticism, you tried with postal, and it was pretty good. You got insecure and your last resort was an update log which didn't state ai at all but ''an exciting revamp of visuals!'' seriously? If you need artists to draw hell i'd do it for free dude.

It feels like the only people who are supporting this AI nightmare are people who are only out to sell and not create art, in other words they don't have any passion and it shows. '' BUT IT LOOKS SO GOOD!!!! '' dude, the guy has a bunch of outlines on his face, the fingers look like my grandmas colostomy bag, the presentation is illogical, colors are inconsistent, everything looks like feces if you take a closer look, if you can't see it, i'll pay a visit for an eye check up.

you should have hired real artists, you should have opened up to your community more about the difficulties of your work, i bet some people who love this game would actually love to contribute. too late now.

so in conclusion, this game was great, with a fantastic vr port, and you were trying to get a lot of new sales by promising us things you can't actually do yourself so you just gave up and used AI? wow. what a waste, welcome to your own funeral. | It's a travesty to the hobby of pinball that these devs are the sole people providing access to the wonderful tables of Zaccaria for many people outside of Europe. The physics were already questionable at best and the rules descriptions of Zaccaria's original 70s and 80s tables were already lacking. Now, they have rejected the quality work of past human artists to turn their Retro and Remake tables into trashy AI-generated slop. Don't give Magic Pixel any support, monetary or otherwise; I regret that I have done so in the past. | This is really good.

A mix of real world and fictional pinball tables with realistic light effects and physics.

처음부터 팩을 워낙에 퍼주는데

처음 주는팩을 모두 까서 전설이 6개이상 나오면 무난한편.(필수전설은 있어야한다)

하지만 메타와 밸런스가 좀 더 안정감 있었다면 좋을텐데 라는 아쉬움을 조금 남깁니다..

돌창소리 듣기 싫은 당신에게 이게임을 추천합니다
대신 당신은 이제 씹덕이라는 소리를 듣게되겠죠 | Yes, it's a lot lilke Hearthstone, a game I enjoy immensely.

BUT ... the quality of life touches in Shadowverse just make this game so much nicer to play.

- Deck codes allow you to import an entire deck list instead of building it card by card.
- Replay mode lets you review your last 10 games.
- Story mode is more challenging and interesting than the Hearthstone tutorial.
- Daily rewards just for logging in.
- THREE quests every day.
- Rewards for reaching milestones in Ranked play.
- Special events with even more achievements and unique rewards.
- Prebuilt decks available for purchase, allowing you a 100 percent chance of getting certain cards.

HOWEVER ... I've now played enough of the game to see that the balance is very heavily skewed toward high-end-combo play. Most games between competitive decks are just a race to see who can get the big legendary combo off first, or to see if you can play your combo before the other guy draws the counter. All other turns are rendered trivial, so in a lot of cases it just boils down to a coin toss.

I'm not going to take back my positive review because I really do admire the foundation. And I recognize that other people do like this style of gameplay; it's just not for me. So while I'm going to uninstall it after saving this revised review, I still think it's worth a try for those who like CCGs. It's free, after all, and they are pretty generous with the cards, even though you'll never get enough free cards to be competitive. | [h1]I LOVE THE DEVELOPERS![/h1]

I wasn't even online and I got a bunch of packs for 'bearing with them' as they had to delay the Bahamut release. Not many card game companies are this generous. You get so many rewards for levelling the leaders, playing the campaign, and just playing the game. Even the daily quests all 'cooldown' faster after you earn them all.

The daring complexity, the fantastic mechanics, and the overall amazing style of the game manages to make a [b]very[/b] balanced and enjoyable card game to play. And there's not a whole lot of RNG everywhere (fuck you Fiery Bat) that just plagues the game for no reason. When RNG is present, it's tastefully done and a small chunk of RNG is good for card games.

Easily one of the best card games and I'm glad it's finally on Steam! Linking my account to my Steam account was super easy.

My only suggestion to the developers is possibly making a more fulfilling arena experience by allowing us to get higher than 5 wins. I feel as though that's one thing Hearthstone did really well. | Shadowverse es un CCG de estetica anime, con similitudes sobretodo con el conocido Hearthstone. 

Sin embargo, a nuestro juicio su sistema de juego y mecánicas estan algo más pulidas.

Shadowverse es un juego free to play, y es ciertamente generoso con el nuevo jugador, llegando a otorgarle alrededor de 30 o 40 sobres iniciales una vez completados los primeros pasos y la campaña introductoria a las bases del juego que tiene. Por supuesto se pueden comprar booster packs con dinero real, si el jugador considera oportuno adquirirlos. Además el juego tiene cross-play entre Steam y Android, por lo que puedes jugar directamente con jugadores de la otra plataforma sin ningún problema, además puede conservar y traspasar tu progreso de un dispositivo a otro, por ejemplo si juegas en steam, pero te vas de viaje, puede pasar tu progreso a una tablet y seguir jugando Shadowverse alla donde vayas.

Con el paso del tiempo, en expansiones de Hearthstone se ha ido fomentando el juego agresivo, con mazos enfocados unicamente en ir a la cara del enemigo sin preocuparse lo mas minimo por el control de mesa. Que es el fundamento principal de base de un juego de cartas, por las posibilidades que te da..

Pero antes de nada deberemos empezar por contar los fundamentos básicos del juego, una de las características mas notorias, y que llama la atencion a primera vista del jugador, es que en shadowverse existe la mecanica de evolucionar a tus esbirros (llamados followers en el juego). Cuando se inicia una partida, se determina quien sale primero o segundo, la diferencia entre una y otra es que el primero posee la ventaja del tempo en cuanto a puntos de mana y 2 puntos de evolucion *de serie* a su disposicion, mientras que el que sale segundo cuanta con la ventaja de tener un punto de evolución más para un total de tres, y una carta adicional al empezar la partida.
Evolucionar un follower, normalmente supone otorgarle un +2/+2 (ataque/salud) a un esbirro y además se le concede la habilidad rush, que quiere decir que puede atacar a otro follower en el mismo turno en el que es jugado. No confundir con cargar, que recibe el nombre de storm en el juego, que en este caso si puede atacar directamente al heroe enemigo, pero como decimos no son muchos los followers con esta caracteristica de storm. Pero además existen followers que activan habilidades extras al ser evolucionados, normalmente a costa de ganar solo +1/+1 o de no ganar ningun stat, estas habilidades pueden ser desde causar un daño en área, sanar a tu heroe, etc...

**Nota: Al decir de serie nos referimos al empezar la partida, ya que hay formas de ganar puntos de evolucíon adicionales, con followers determinados por ejemplo que tiene la habilidad de recargar los puntos de evolución total o parcialmente.**

Los desarrolladores Cygames, estan trabajado en como resolver el hecho sabido por los jugadores, de que el que sale segundo en la partida cuenta con una ligera ventaja, de forma que se esta estudiando la forma de igualar la balanza para que uno u otro tengan la mismas posibilidades en funcion del orden en el que salgan. Segun las estadísticas facilitadas en el último noticeboard, hablamos de que una diferencia de alrededor de un 5% en relacion de winrate segun se salga primero o segundo.

Añadir que existen actualmente y a fecha de este análisis 7 clases disponibles:
- Forestcraft: Cuya habilidad consta de combar cartas activando efectos una vez se juegan 2 o mas cartas por turno
- Runecraft: Cuya habilidad llamada spellboost hace que las cartas con estas características vean reforzado su efecto cada vez que se lanza un hechizo
- Swordcraft: Cuya habilidad trata de jerarquías de cartas en relacion a oficial y comandante, activando efectos adicionales al tener comandantes en juego.
- Dragoncraft: La cual tiene como característica el ""overflow"" que se producen efectos de cartas al tener 7 puntos de mana o más.
- BloodCraft: La cual activa su habilidad característica al tener el héroe 10 o menos de vida.
- Shadowcraft: EL cual tiene como habilidad el usas la necromancia, es decir cada vez que un esbirro aliado muere, se suma un punto a un contador, que puede ser usado para activar distintos efectos.
- Havencraft: Que tiene como habilidad las cartas de countdwon, generalmente amuletos que tienen un fuerte impacto pero que necesitan de varios turnos para activarse, aunque puede reducirse este tiempo con otras cartas.

El caso es que en Shadowverse, el daño directo al jugador rival desde la mano, es muy dificil, tiene un alto coste, o requiere de un elaborado combo para llegar a hacerlo.
Esto no quiere decir que no existan en Shadowverse mazos agresivos, ya que por supuesto que los hay, sobretodo en clases como BloodCraft o Swordcraft entre otros, pero mayormente en shadowverse lo que impera es el intercambio de cartas / followers.

Por último decir que el juego esta bastante bien equilibrado en su mayoría, cada clase tiene muchas posibilidades y varias cartas key para orientar el mazo a un estilo de juego o caracteristica u otra función, mazos de descartes, mazos de sanación, mazos de combo...
A nuestro parecer solo existe una única carta que esta OP, llamada Daria, Dimensional Witch, la cual ha otorgado una gran popularidad a la clase runecraft (alrededor de 1/3 de jugadores actualmente), pero que se le puede ganar si sabes como contrarrestar su efecto.

Asi que querido lector, si estas indeciso, desde aqui te recomendamos que lo pruebes, es un juego que engancha y divierte, y si vienes de juegos como hearthstone, el período de aprendizaje es muy muy corto.

**Nota: El juego esta disponible en inglés, no en castellano, al menos a fecha de este análisis, aunque es cierto que es un ingles muy muy básico y que aun sin dominar el idioma, cualquier jugador puede hacerse a los menus y textos muy facilmente.

Un saludo | 一応おすすめですが、無料だし一回くらい手を付けても良いのでは？程度です。

幼いころから学生時代にかけて、遊戯〇やなんとかマスターズなどをプレイしていた事がありましたが・・・。このゲームは「デッキを１から自分で考える」というカードゲームの醍醐味が失われているように感じました。

パクリだとか、バランスが悪いとかそれ以前の問題に思えるのは私だけでしょうか。いや、それも問題なんですけどね。バランスが完璧になっても、結局他人のデッキコピーすれば同じことですよね。言いたいのはそういう事です。

一番呆れたのはデッキコードを入力すれば他人のデッキがそのまま使えるという、思考停止機能。そりゃプロが考えたデッキをコピれば素人でもある程度強くなりますよね。デッキはカード一覧を眺めて１から作るのが楽しいもんだと思っていたため、価値観の違いに驚きました。

ランクマッチで上にいけばいくほど、同じようなデッキばかりで面白くありません。どのカードゲームでもドラゴン使いでしたので、本作でもドラゴンのみを使い、ストーリーをクリアした後ランクマッチを重ね、先日B1ランクまで到達しましたが・・・コピーデッキはもういいです。彼らに遭遇した場合、勝っても負けても同じ手でくるから面白くないし、でてくるカードが全く同じだと笑えてすらきますね。それなら昔のカードゲームのCOMプレイヤーと変わりませんよ・・・。

悪いところばかり書いてしまいましたが、フルボイスでカードのデザインが綺麗な点は戦闘を盛り上げていますし、一部のバランスブレイカーを除けばなかなか遊べると思いますよ。ストーリーだけプレイして、コンピューター対戦の超級を制覇するだけでも無料にしては十分遊べるかと。フレンドとプレイも出来ますし。工夫があれば十分遊べるゲームだと思います。

例えば、使用禁止カードをお互い決めてデッキを組み、対戦するのも楽しいですよ。

カードゲームとして純粋に楽しみたいなら、カードの種類だけ情報を集め１からデッキ構築するか、２Pickがお勧めです。最初は負けていても、改良を重ねて勝利数が増えてくると嬉しいものです。人によってはデッキに愛着がわくかもしれません。

光る部分は十分あるゲームですので、今後改善を少しだけ期待しています。"

[b]Ultimately, ChuSingura46+1 is a trap.[/b] At first the game appears to be all boobs and action, however, that's a trick to get you into playing an emotional and powerful story loosely based on real historical events that becomes massively addicting. In fact, besides how quickly addicting the game becomes, it's surprising how historically accurate the game is. Besides an obvious gender swap and the other fictional aspects of the story, the events and backstories of the characters provide a great and entertaining insight into the real story of the 47 Ronin who avenged their master. It does it so well, it is  arguably better than any other modern English retelling (maybe even Japanese too)! So enjoyable, before I knew it, I was 30 hours in and 3 chapters completed in one weekend.

[b]If you haven't played ChuSingura46+1 S, do it.[/b] You won't regret your time playing. The first chapter is free and will provide you with an exciting, fun, and almost completely standalone fictional retelling of the events of the 47 Ronin. However, be prepared, it's hard to resist purchasing the following chapters based on how great the game is and wanting to hear more about its wide cast of characters.

[b]If like me, you get completely hooked playing ChuSinGura46+1 S, I promise you that you won't regret buying chapters 2+3 and 4+5.[/b] I purchased them at full price and have not regretted it for a moment. The story only continues to get better, Yasubee (the best character obvs.) gets a chapter heavily focused on her (thank goodness) and most importantly, the game stays fun and does not drag out like other longer visual novel.

steam版是PSV移植，不止阉割了hs，还硬改了所有少儿不宜的文本，导致一些人物的个性变得奇怪，毕竟这黄油厂在努力考据历史的同时也非常努力的在往里面融入工口和萌。
同时steam版演出效果直接打了对折，音质画质甚至字体都变得糟糕，最要命的是运行反而各种卡顿和费电。

AＯRクラＯドと肩を並べるほど神ゲーだと自分は思っています | It's been 2 years since i completed this game and it still to this day manages to make me reminisce about that transcendent journey to the Edo era Japan and is the reason why I am making this review for those who felt put off from the game like I used to.

First while the plot synopsis seemed interesting, the artstyle put me off from playing this for years.
Then some time later I was struggling to find interesting translated visual novels to enjoy and so, searched for my favourite trope in VNDB tags and Chusingura was near the top of the results, just below Steins;Gate and ML Alternative.
I immediately bought it and boy what a ride it was. No regrets whatsoever even when it felt pricey for what it looked ought to be.

The artstyle i got over (and actually kinda started liking it) within hour or two. The wonky animations for fight scenes are luckily very scarce and didn't affect my opinion on this game at all.

All the small details in the game world (other than the genderswitch/play) felt so real. Like this was working world, characters had their roles to fill and lifelike prejudices against the MainChara all of that and much more felt so thought out.

I feel like that if the developers wouldn't have made this with eroge in mind, this might have been very well known staple of VN literature. It still is in my opinion, but it hides it well behind that artstyle. | 山不在高，另请高明。

76561198025344110,481180,System Crash,10.0,"Indie, Strategy",18,"Decent enough cyberpunk aesthetics and story, but the gameplay is absolutely garbage if you have played more than a couple card games. The most basic possible mechanics, four lanes that autoattack with mana that scales automatically each turn, draw 1 per turn. Pretends to have more going on but the ""objective"" system is literally just life points but they count up instead of down. I had hopes from the intro, but every mechanical explanation depressed me further. Additionally, for a single player game, the drip of new cards is absolutely pathetic. It takes a couple dozen missions to be able to do anything you might reasonably call ""deckbuilding"", and meaningful synergies are at least 8-10 HOURS in. 

In the finer points, the hard control cards are also maddening. At the beginning there aren't that many, although the control for support cards is ubiquitous among the opponents, so playing the expensive ones is largely pointless. After you get to the point of ramp cards, hard unit removal, and lots of haste (no summoning sickness) cards showing up, it starts to feel more and more pointless to try and develop a board. The deckbuilding interface is also trash, with no search function for attributes, so building based on the synergies that exist is an absolute chore, and rebuilding your deck for specific enemy challenges is a pain in the ass. I was immediately turned off by the mechanics of this game, but I felt I had to give it a fair shake before leaving a negative review. The lazy card game mechanics just keep coming. Unless it's hiding 12+ hours in, there is nothing of interest you could find in this game that hasn't been done a thousand times in better ones.

Here are several much, much better games you could go play right now:
Faeria
Solforge Fusion
Runescape Chronicles (there's a fan run free version even since it's dead)
Netrunner (physical, still worth it, and if you want the cyberpunk theme, there's none better) | Highly recommended!

For me, this is one of the better CCGs:
- intuitive to pick up, there's quite some variation in cards and effects but nothing crazy (not like some not to be named CCGs that require a 15 page glossary to play)
- the mix between combat damage and ""hacking points"" is brilliant, it avoids that whoever drops the biggest creatures wins and also forces a certain pace in the rounds
- the layout is clear and works beautifully
- once you get past the initial rounds and have some credits to spend on customizing your deck, it becomes much more interesting and gameplay becomes much more varied; the initial rounds of both campaigns can be tough but a little deck adjustment goes a long way
- everything in the game from the story to the artwork, the cards and their effects all fits perfectly with the cyberpunk theme

RNG does have a significant impact but there's no penalty for losing a battle and the rounds are quite fast, so it's not that big of a deal.
There's the occasional hiccup when the game locks up but for the same reason, this is not a big problem.

I would have loved to have a few more campaigns (still need to try the Underworld DLC) but then again, I'm sure I will play though them several times more, trying different decks and approaches. And the arena mode is ideal if you only have a few minutes to kill."

Плюс это порт мобильный донатной игры. | Faeria is fun. Okay, I can see myself spending 10 more hours on fighting AI on Pandora Mode. I already spent 28 hours. The rest of the game depends if I can push myself over the skill cliff of deckbuilding, because it's really hard. I can recommend this game very easily. I get to max out the utility of every monster, every decision, and win a lot.

But let's go into the reasons why this game isn't successful. NOTE: I go against AI and don't really compete.
- Faeria looks like a typo to a lot of search engines. It's very close to Fairy.
- You don't get to walk around. Like every other trading card game, you battle and these battles can get lengthy. There's no rest stop besides staring at the card collection.
- The campaign mode is fighting random NPCs with one-liners and that's it. There's no story, no satisfying closures besides winning, no secrets to unlock beyond the loot boxes of cards. The boss battles do have that unfair advantage, but there's no extra flair to them so they still look like normal NPCs to fight. While you are building a card collection, most people won't feel the dopamine of progress.
- In a fair match, the tension is not there for a lot of mid games. You either steamroll or get steamrolled. This might be because I play very defensively and haven't touched the aggressive cards. This might also be b/c I don't play competitively. I like steamrolling, but variety is the spice of life.
- Most of us will never ever beat this game, because the hard challenges are really hard. Many games can split the difficulty into Easy Mode, Normal Mode, and Hard Mode. This game doesn't split those modes, it blends them all together (easy stuff first ofc) and you know, not everyone wants to play Hard Mode. Like I said, my next 10 hours are probably going to be Pandora Mode and ignore the rest of it.
- I've fallen into playing very defensively. Like I ALWAYS go for the faeria well on the first turn. This might be a me problem, but I feel like it's the strongest strat.

What is Pandora Mode? You build a random deck 1 card at a time and play 6 random NPCs in a FAIR match. And there's rewards for it.

But again, I like the game. But again, I like utilizing every card to the most of its ability, being very goal-orientated when I place new land, and then steamrolling my AI opponents."

Let me list the cons on my playthrough first, because though I'm feeling particularly generous, this isn't a 'good' game by most metrics.

The bad:
To say the gameplay loop is repetitive would be the understatement of the century. 
The same 10 or so dungeon types are used without variation for your entire playthrough.
The story suffers from JRPG bloat on a massive scale. It's seriously the longest 91 hours I can remember playing. It just. Never. Ends.
The bosses are all relatively similar.
The anime melodrama is ridiculous, and Haseo is the definition of emo.
I only decided to play the (comparatively brief) 4th installment because I wanted my waifu of choice in a final cut scene, and whatever obscure thing I needed to do, I didn't, and I ended up engaged to the 'villain'. What the actual ****...
The combat...meh, nothing to write home about.
And the constant need to log in and log out to check email within the game was incredibly tedious and time-consuming.
Who the hell is this Tabby character that suddenly appears?
Oh and did I mention that for the first entire section our hero is a total jerk?

All of that said...
The good:
There's a nostalgic 2000's PS2 vibe here that's sort of undeniable.  I enjoyed the attempt to make this feel like an early MMO, along with fan art and old school forums.  The news and Online Jack anime segments helped to flesh out what was happening in the real world. And the characters despite the anime cliches are all basically winning (except for Haseo himself, but he improves over time), and the voice acting (on the Japanese side, I don't know about the English) is spot on. And its the rare game where I stuck with it to the end and maxed out my character, so that must say something.
The Sakubo character is actually pretty interesting from a psychological perspective (no spoilers).
The music goes pretty hard.
If you take a break, this game is good at hand-holding you back into the story.  I never felt lost.
Oh, and on the lowest difficulty, it wasn't too hard.

The verdict: 
This was a slog. There's no doubt about it. But in the end, I enjoyed finishing up my time in The World.  If you're going to give it a shot, play it a couple quests at a time and take breaks. Savor it. Because trying to binge this will probably wreck you... | 《一觉醒来全世界游戏水平下降10000倍，重新入坑的我稍微练级就吊打排名大佬》
学生时代简单了解过hack系列的大制作，但当时没有主机无缘体验，近期赶上游戏荒还-90%就买来体验一番。
游戏时间20小时进度是通过vol.1，vol.2在序盘阶段，玩下来想吐槽的点有很多。
先从重制移植说起，GU是hack系列第二部游戏，不知道为什么不先重制移植第一作让玩家能从头开始认识系列。
剧情方面我只想用弱智来评价，虽然用现在的眼光去评价一款十多年前的游戏剧情可能有失公允，但我认为即使是十年前的我也只会用弱智来评价本作的剧情。就如本评价标题所写，角色战力设定莫名奇妙，并且主角如同一个低能小学生，既无礼又无智，一天到晚对队友无能狂怒，被反派玩弄于股掌之中，他能牛逼起来纯粹是因为他是主角。
游戏性方面也没什么好说的，同样如标题所说，并没有什么jrpg游戏该有的策略性和挑战性，不存在什么攻略策略，就是练练级然后碾压通过，战斗过程就如同砍传奇，打通vol.1我甚至连一个消耗道具都没有用过，也可能因为舞台设定是网游，确实这种无脑体验比较贴近网游的生态。
写完这篇评测我估计我也不会继续玩下去了，没体验过的玩家我建议有时间还是尽量吃点好的。 | .hack..G.U. Last Recode is a fun and interesting game. The art style is nice and the game is rich in story. I enjoy the interactions with each characters and the MMO feel that this game brings. Even through this game is a single-player game, its world makes it feel like you are in a MMO in a since. The story is enjoyable and have some funny moments at times. The battles could be a little better but they are okay. Once you get later into the game you will be able to use more than one weapon but the combat is alright. Play the game for its story. It will take some time to beat but its fun to play."

Pour ce qui est du Jeu , je suis mitigé entre mettre un pouce + ou un pouce bas , finalement , vu le temps que je passe ( et vais passer dessus) , j'ai jugé que çà serait injuste de mettre une review negative .. donc ...

Coté esthétique c'est assez jolie , ceux qui ont joué à ff14 , reconnaitrons même leur ""skin"" favoris , l'histoire c'est du bateau en boite hin , le coup du ""hero amnésique qui va sauver le monde car blabla la prophétie"" on a déja vu çà 3212 fois ....
Mais curieusement le héro ( forcément masculin, désolé Mesdames) est assez cynique et pleins d'auto-dérisions , çà surprend et çà evite le naufrage...

Coté gameplay c'est plutot vif ,mélangeant des inspirations de plusieurs final fantasy ( 14.. 13 ...), et çà se laisse jouer , bien qu'un peu répétitif ( surtout au début)

Par contre le coté qui m'a dérangé assez vite , en outre de la RNG des tirages de cartes ( les compétences en gros ), c'est le FARMING à outrance , pour monter vos cartes ils vous faudra , sans mentir , farmer des dizaines d'heures ...peut être des centaines ( je me rend pas encore trés bien compte)...

Pour en revenir au RNG , donc l'aspect aléatoire des cartes , qui sont en gros votre "" deck""  de compétences , vos aptitudes si vous préférez ..
Celles offertes dans les premiéres heures de jeu , ne servent à rien , des cartes bas de games que vous passerez à la moulinette de la "" fusion"" sans les regarder , tellements leurs stats sont inexistantes ... Il vous faudra chauffer la cb pour en avoir des mieux , ou être trés patient ...
Tout est accessible sans payer , c'est vrai , ca prendra juste 22 ans 11 mois , 23 jours de plus ...

Bref ... Pas un mauvais jeu , mais bon .... Mitigé je dirais , manque un ""pouce mitigé "" dans les avis je trouve...

Pour finir , quelques conseils en vracs ...

1) gardez vos premiére magilith pour acheter le pack "" cadeau Mobius sur 30 jours "", c'est le meilleure qualité prix pour les débutants

2) si vous voulez essayer le jeu ,ne tardez pas , la sortie du jeu est accompagnée d'une campagne de cadeau de bienvenue

3) n'investissez aucuns point dans une carte inférieures à 3 étoiles 

4) changez de classe dés que c'est possible , les classes de départs sont assez faibles

5) n'allez pas sur les iles de ""loot"" sur la carte du monde , c'est beaucoup trop dur à bas level ...

6) une de vos 4 cartes de ""deck "" DOIT  etre une carte de heal ( avec des coeurs) sinon vous passerez jamais les premiers boss ...

Bonne chance | Primero este juego es Final Fantasy. Mejor dicho: Es muchos Final Fantasy. Tiene una historia y unos eventos que permite conectar con casi cualquier mundo hasta ahora conocido de Final Fantasy anteriores. Viejos conocidos, caras nuevas. Y no solo en los eventos, también en la historia.

Segundo este juego es un Final Fantasy ""gratis"" con condiciones. Si quieres gastar dinero, adelante, pero con cuidado. El sistema que sigue para gastar tu dinero son magicitas y/o tickets que se consiguen gratis o pagando con magicitas. Las magicitas se usan para casi cualquier cosa en el juego. Es decir hay microtransacciones, pero no te levantan un muro donde ya no puedas avanzar. Se puede jugar perfectamente sin gastar nada, con las magicitas diarias y con mucha paciencia. No hay ninguna necesidad de avanzar a golpe de cartera. El juego tampoco esta pensado para eso, ya que no hay mucho donde gastar. Salvo si eres un coleccionista, entonces sí. Ya sean cartas de edición limitada, las mascotas o las cartas de clase (job cards) Te ves obligado a gastar. Para una experiencia de juego normal no hace falta.

Tercero este juego es un Final Fantasy por tiempo. Este juego tiene una barra de estamina que *no te permite seguir avanzando cuando se gasta. A no ser que tengas elixires, pero se consiguen fácilmente y al principio se sube rapido, por lo que apenas lo notaras.

Cuarto este es un Final Fantasy que engancha. Sí. Decididamente parece que no, pero sí. Cuando te introduzcas en la historia, pasado el capítulo II y empieces a comprender a los personajes, te hagas las aventuras secundarias y las torres de batalla - otros eventos - te darás cuenta que llevas mucho tiempo jugando.

Quinto este Final Fantasy requiere dedicación, pero se adapta al jugar casual. No es necesario correr para pasar la historia porque el juego va estableciendo un ritmo para que vayas al ritmo que este se desbloquea. No es cuestión de una semana o dos. Eso te desgasta y te deja una experiencia negativa de juego. Este juego es para ser jugado a ratos. Por lo que te llevara varios meses llegar por donde va el juego actualmente. Las batallas solo se hacen repetitivas si juegas el juego durante largos periodos de tiempo. No esta pensado para eso. Los ""rusheos"" no valen de nada aquí.

Sexto este Final Fantasy es un buen competidor en historia con otros de la saga anterior. No tienes la libertad, ni el grupo que te acompañe, ni la capacidad de cambiar el equipo pre-establecido - skin -  salvo el arma y las cartas. Cuando vayas jugando y aprendiendo de la historia te darás cuenta que tiene sentido para este juego y no te importara. La pega y virtud del sistema de cartas, componente importante al que achaco la falta de explicación de los parametros y como subir las habilidades o que función tienes algunas cartas, que no queda demasiado claro. 

Septimo este Final Fantasy aprovecha muy bien el Fan Service. Si eres fan de anteriores Final Fantasy entonces hay una alta probabilidad de que te encuentres como en casa.

Nada más que añadir que lo llevo jugando desde que salió en el móvil, y que lo único que le pondría como pega, es la falta de una traducción al castellano. 

Muy recomendable | This is going to be a long review. If you only want to know if it's worth or not: it IS. Alternatively, you can scroll down and read the ""conclusion"" section.
This review comes from a long time Final Fantasy player and fan, but I'll be as impartial as I can now.

Story: 

Mobius Final Fantasy involves the story of the prophecy of the Warrior of The Light in the fight against the Chaos. [spoiler]Older Final Fantasy players will recognize Garland.[/spoiler]
The concept it's not much original, but the events that happen within the story deserves a note: they're pretty connected and the dialogues are very good as well.
It's also important to progress in story to unlock more single player areas and challenges, which give awesome rewards.


Gameplay:

So far, there are 3 Classes (Jobs in the game) - Warrior, Mage and Ranger - and there are 4 roles: Attacker, Breaker, Defender and Healer. Attackers can be either Warriors or Mages and they are the source of raw damage. Enemies have an orange bar below their HP bar, which is their Break gauge. While they have it, they'll take less damage (both from skills and basic attacks), and when this bar drops to 0, they enter in the ""break"" state, which makes them be stunned for (usually) 4~5 turns, taking more damage from all sources and this is where the Breaker role enters in, usually coming from Warriors and mainly Rangers jobs. Defenders (usually Warriors) are the tanks, absorbing most of the damage from enemies and sometimes even taunting them. Healers (Mages) are the ones buffing and healing the entire party and even soaking up some damage if necessary.
You start with 3 avaliable jobs: Onion Knight (Warrior), Apprentice Mage (Mage) and Neophyte Ranger (Ranger) and they evolve, unlocking another jobs. Not only that, but we may find other jobs from older Final Fantasy games, like: Thief, Dragoon, Red Mage and so on.
The battles are turn-based like Final Fantasy VII, VIII and IX for example. There is no Mana Bar, you use the skills through orbs you generate. (like some puzzle games mechanics nowadays) It is worth mentioning that you'll generate only orbs that your Job uses - Every job uses 3 different elements of the 7 avaliable: Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, Light, Dark and Life.
There is also the Ultimate, which is exactly like the Limit in Final Fantasy VII and VIII and Trance in IX: An unique and supreme skill. Every Job has a different Ultimate and the bar fills when you hit and take damage.
Your avaliable skills will be determined by your cards, which you can acquire from monsters (weaker versions) or bought from Ability Shop with Ability Tickets, which is mostly composed of known figures to Final Fantasy players like Ifrit, Shiva, Moggle, etc. You can get up to 4 cards which will determine your skills. They also gain level and exp just like you and give you different attributes (HP, Magic, etc) when leveling and they are also separated/classified by class afinity: (Warrior/Mage/Ranger)
You will spend stamina for each fight (they recover when you level up) and you are unable to fight when you are out of stamina. But you can still join Multiplayer parties if you want some recovery, you only spend stamina in Multiplayer if you create a party, not if you join them. (you recover 1 stamina every 5 minutes both in Single and Multiplayer, they have individual stamina bars.)


Graphics:

The graphics are great, 4k/60 FPS and the character details are literally 10/10, specially if you are a Final Fantasy fan. 
The only thing is that sometimes the landscapes are too much in second place because your character is pretty much always zoomed that the landscapes are either are not noticed or feels repetitive, but they also look very good.


Sound:

The sound can get repetitive because of the ""Map music"" which is kind of a short loop, but the battle songs are amazing. 
Most of them are fast-paced (usually rock songs that feel fresh and adds an exciting atmosphere) and you can still recognize some small things, like the cursor moving, that's the same sound from the oldest Final Fantasy games and the traditional victory theme, of course.


Conclusion:

At first I thought it was a pay-to-win game, because of Stamina and Magicite, (Cash currency) but I was completely wrong. Not only the game gives you lots of Elixirs, (recover stamina) it also gives you magicite per day.
The turn based battles gives a nostalgia feel while maintaining the modern graphics and interfaces and it's a fun game to play not only single but multiplayer as well.

Story: 6/10 - A bit generic for Final Fantasy standards but above average for Online games.
Gameplay: 9/10 - Lacks a friendlist and Mana would be better than orbs: Even though this is fun, it depends on luck sometimes.
Graphics: 9/10 - Only drawback is the background, that sometimes needed to be highlighted more.
Sound: 8/10 - Pretty good battle songs, but it can get boring if you are spending much time on maps deciding what to do, as the map songs are mostly loops.

Final score: 8/10 | Leia a analise abaixo ou se preferir assista o vídeo de primeiras impressões aqui:

Breve Descrição :

O jogo Mobius Final Fantasy foi inicialmente lançado para mobile, e enfim portado agora para o PC!

O game possui um sistema de combate por turnos com grande referências aos últimos jogos da sua franquia (FF XIII), aonde você possui um número de ""ações"" que devem ser utilizadas com suas habilidades.

Estas habilidades são tomadas por cartas dentro do jogo, sendo que cada monstro que você derrota há uma possível chance de você receber sua carta, e por consequência uma habilidade nova.

A customização do jogo é excelente, contendo diversos tipos de ""decks"" para montar, equipamentos e jobs, que alteram completamente sua estratégia ao longo das lutas.

Para você progredir dentro do jogo, é necessário gastar um recurso de stamina, ou seja aquela famosa Energia que irá se recuperar enquanto você não está jogando.

A portabilidade no geral ficou bem feita, os gráficos estão excelentes assim como a jogabilidade.

No geral é um jogo que eu recomendo! Você vai perder um bom tempo e ainda curtir uma boa história pela campanha.

Análise:

Pontos Positivos:

* Excelentes gráficos.
* Portabilidade bem feita.
* Diversas opções para customização.

Pontos Negativos:

* O jogo se torna um pouco repetitivo rapidamente, devido ao seu estilo. | Despite seeing the 'not reccomended' reviews on this page, I didn't have any problems with the app. However because it's a mobile app desgined originally for the mobile devices, take this into consideration:

- Just like any other game, like Brave Frontier, Unison League, or Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius, it has a stamina function, which limits how much you can play. When you get deeper into the story ,or when it's challenging, you will lose a lot of stamina, which then you can only get it back by not playing the game, or using Elixirs. (You can't do a marathon on this game without Elixirs or $$$)

- It's free, but there's in-app purchasing in the game, like Clash of Clans (though Mobius Final Fantasy isn't a Pay 2 Win game)

-TAKES LONG TO LOAD if this is your first time playing the game! Like all of the apps I play, it needs to download its resources and assets, and depending on your computer, it'll take 15 minutes to as long as possible. It might even ask you to be closer to your wifi, which isn't possible unless you are using a laptop. 

-The tutorial is long. When you want to go somewhere else during the tutorial, you can't click anywhere else be doing what you want, instead, you have to do what the game tells you to do.
It's around 1 hour to complete the tutorial which is the only reason I hate it.

Other than that, I had no problems playing the game. I take games pretty lightly so I can't really criticize that hard. I don't pay too much attention to the graphics (they're just enlarged and has more pixels, but it's for a phone-like device, not a computer so expect some low quality at times) So far, I'm enjoying the game and I would recommend this game."

....It's good. It's free. Try it. | 认真的玩了九个小时游戏  ，等级达到了100级。前来进行点评，
首先要感谢作者把这个很好玩的游戏免费放了出来。
优点：
1、游戏的语言问题不存在，只要稍懂英语就可以轻松的进行游戏了；
2、游戏的画风，非常符合现在的像素风，而且人物和NPC即视效果很不错；
3、虽然是免费游戏，但道具和金钱的获取上，并不是很困难，轻易上手。非常好；
4、画面可调，可控，色彩的效果也很不错，不会因为长时间玩而头晕；
5、这里的英雄都是用金币请来帮你打架的，而且随着你的等级升高，甚至连NPC都是可以请出来替你挥菜刀的呢。
6、游戏里，还时不时的会出现一些随机的运气奖励，选对了补血或有优质道具，选错了，就有一定的惩罚。
7、这个游戏采用了五层一小关，小BOSS打死没有奖励 ，十层一大关，出现的大BOSS打死后，会有三个箱子任你选择！
     奖励的玩法虽然老旧，但我承认，非常有效！！
缺点：
1、怪物的建模明显偷工了，有好多怪物都是变了一下颜色就挥动上来了；
2、催眠魔法太烦人了。到了80层之后，基本大怪小怪都会的天然萌技能。

技巧 ：
1、赌运气选择左右塔的游戏，可以试着玩，因为如果成功了，会有不错的奖励道具。 
2、游戏里可以请的英雄，里面有一个是小偷技能。 这个小偷太强大了！！！！
    （1）他的技能是一只手，可以在打每十关出现的BOSS时先偷BOSS身上的一次钱。也就是最终钱数X2
    （2）选择了小偷，最后开箱子的时候，是三个一起全开。超级帅的感觉有没有。很快你的装备就有了。
3、后期发现了一个偷懒的打法：
人物选择 ：
法师（会闪电）
小偷（偷钱开箱子）
医生（群体治疗、单体加血去异常状态）
医生（群体治疗、单体加血去异常状态）
法师（会闪电）
PS：
           按这样的人物排列后，打起怪来，效果真的非常好。无论怪物单刷还是群体，都无所畏惧。
           而且就算怪物给你使劲的催眠，但你有两个医生，总会把人清醒回来。

再次感谢作者！这就是我玩这个游戏的一点小小的感受心得。也希望 我的心得对您的游戏有所帮助。 | Ok to keep it short and simple. If you like idle games you will find this game appealing. If you do not like idle games stay away from it .

The game is pretty simple you are a coward but to still reap the rewards of dungeon crawling you hire soda addicts in the local bar to do your job. You can set the group on automatic mode or use their ability on your own. Playing the group on your own is pretty repitive therefor i set it on automatic. It's a simple yet fun idle game :)

Видеообзор с геймплеем:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUcAzdAYfbY


Кратко, суть игры в следующем:

Вы собираете отряд (стандартно - танк, хилер, дд-шник) и отправляетесь на уничтожение боссов в чужие подземелья\лабиринты.

В то же время, собираете свое подземелье\лабиринт и ждете атак отрядов соперников. Своим лабиринтом и мобами в нем вы не управляете. Собрали данж, и ждете пока совершат рейд на вас, смотрите результат, прокачиваете босса, меняете колоду. 

Да, это же карточная игра, так что у каждого босса и героя есть своя колода, и по мере прокачивания как тех, так и других, появляется все больше опций для декбилдинга. 

Ожидаемо для ККИ, здесь есть бустеры, система довольно стандартная - их можно покупать за золото, можно за денежку, есть квесты и награды за бои.

Кстати, каждый раз, когда ваше подземелье оказывается непроходимым для соперника, вы получаете 10 пыли, из которой можно крафтить карты. Чем чаще вы отправляетесь в рейды на чужие подземелья, тем чаще вражеские рейды приходят к вам (что выгодно).

Мне игра понравилась, интересный концепт в сочетании с ощущением настольной игры или ролевого приключения.

Пока она в раннем доступе, не слишком много контента, на многих картах отсутсвует арт, не все реализовано, но вангую, что на релизе это будет 8-10 из 10. Конечно же, на мой субъективный вкус. 

Спасибо, что дочитали. | Labyrinth just went free to play, although it's still in Early Access, so I figured I'd leave a review for people to see whether or not it's worth their time. 
Short answer: Yes.. 
Long answer: ...Yess
/REVIEW END -Throws smokebomb .. just kidding.

Quick Review:
It's a tactical battle thingy. It's good. It's free. It's like pokemon, except in 3D, you control awesome heroes, and you battle against mythological monsters. So not really like pokemon but you get the idea.

Labyrinth?
Yeah the name doesn't really show up in google that well, and there's no David Bowie, Jennifer Connelly, Goblin King or Bog of Eternal Stench (yet).

Outline:
You do collect cards from pack to use in battles, which work as your passives, minions(for bosses) and abilities. It plays like a tactical battle game. Currently (in Early Access) single battles take place in a single arena based on the boss. There's no limited ""energy"" system and you can play as much as you want. The cards are balanced (some cards are better, others are situationally better) and every hero and boss is unique in some way.

Currently there are 6 heroes and 6 bosses, eventually there will be at least 2 heroes of every class type and 8+ bosses. The heroes of the same class share cards, besides a few guaranteed hero-specific cards, but you can only field one of each class. Every hero and boss gets at least one permanent passive ability, some armor, and some basic, more than decent cards to begin with.

Bosses each have two classes and choose their minions and actions from those classes.
It is a tile based game and some bosses/minions take up more tiles than others, from 1x1 (human sized) bosses all the way up to 3x3 (giant) bosses, and even 3x3 minions. The size of the bosses and minions has a subtle effect on play as well, and  in the current version the battlefield terrain can be altered, with lava or cracks, during battle. The battlefield terrain alteration mostly occurs around one of the bosses, who is a magma beast. He bleeds torrents of lava when hit, and can spew lava around him as an attack.

Heroes get two basic abilitys, guard and an individual weapon, that don't consume a card and can be used for card draw or to save/use resources. The basic abilities can be upgraded with some cards, e.g. warfare heroes can equip better weapons, the mages can equip a spell book.
The basic hero weapons themselves have their own class which can be affected by cards. E.g. the fire mage's fire spells become swifter at focus 10, which includes her base attack.
The rogue engineer heroine's base attack counts as a ""ranged attack"" for perks and abilities that buff and trigger on those.

Bosses don't have a base attack and have a smaller hand then heroes, allowing you some control over better AI performance and making boss combos more likely. Every day there is a quest that offers a sum of gold worth around 8-10 victories, so if you can only play once a day it is still efficient. You can hold 3 quests at a time, and change them each once.


Old Reviews:
There were more positive reviews from key backers, but due to a steam policy change of only allowing direct purchases to post reviews that count, some diminished.
Hopefully now that it is free to play they can be restored.
There was a critical bug that delayed the free to play update, and they fixed it the same day, meaning that free to play was only delayed by a single day.


Is It Pay 2 Win Though?
It doesn't feel like it.
There's no premium only content. Everything is available to F2P, and the epic/legendary rate is quite high, although the coin rate is low (balanced by rate). You can also craft all of the obtainable cards in the game with a currency you earn from defense(your boss) battles and disenchanting duplicates. You can get an early lead on obtained cards by paying sure, but a lot of the fun comes from building up your deck and improving it.

Casual matchmaking is partially based on how well you do, and of course Ranked mode is, so the tougher your deck, the tougher your opponents in general. It also means that if you're not doing well you'll likely be matched up with F2P decks in future anyway.

It's also somewhat balanced in that, all cards are effective in one way or another, and for perks/minions, they have a card cost of which you can only spend so much. In my experience, well constructed F2P decks and smart play should be able to win against decks with higher rarity/more powerful cards. It also doesn't take that long to reach max level, by rough estimate you could collect most of the current cards in a few months by doing the daily quest everyday.

You can quit at any time, or if you get disconnected from the game at any time, and you will be able to return back to the raid you were in the middle of.


Playtime?
By comparison, I have more hours on Labyrinth in a week than on:
	XCOM 2
	Hitman: Absolution (100% achievements)
	Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen
	One Way Heroics
	Hand of Fate
	Cargo Commander
	Dungeon of the Endless
	Risk of Rain


Did I mention it's free to play now?


Please, stop reading, I don't have anything else, I beg you, I'm just a humble fisherperson.

Double-click on own units on timebar to see their hand, so you can plan better.
Arrow keys or both mouse buttons to move around field.
RMB to rotate and wheel to zoom in.
In deck selection, RMB to study a summon from summon spell, or craft/disenchant card.
	Guarding is a good way to draw extra cards, since it only costs 1 tick. It's good for Faith if she draws all Heal cards and doesn't need to heal.

Ao jogar Life is Strange: Before the Storm pela primeira vez 8 anos depois do seu lançamento, tudo que me vinha à mente que a Square Enix desperdiçou uma chance incrível de fazer uma prequela memorável. Além o terço inicial do game ser desinteressante, Before the Storm possui tantas inconsistências com o Life is Strange original a ponto de nos fazer questionar o porquê de a Chloe, que tem um processo de evolução incrível em Before the Storm, ter regredido e se tornado a pessoa que vemos no game de 2015.

Só que esses problemas na narrativa de LiS: BtS são facilmente explicados quando a gente entende que o game não foi feito por paixão dos desenvolvedores, como no caso da Dontnod: Ele foi feito por pura ganância da Square Enix, que não aguentou o sucesso do primeiro game e precisou explorar mais a saga.

Só que no fim, apesar dos grandes pesares, o jogo é ok, e pra quem curte a franquia, é mais um  daqueles jogos que devem, ao menos, serem experimentados, afinal, por que não?

Saiba mais na análise que fiz pro canal Marotando: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On8YMuZy1mE | I really like this story and feel it's a good prequel to the original game.
The graphics are slightly better but you play this game for the story anyway.
Although some plot lines are a bit off and very unrealistic, it still seems ok.
8/10 | Chloe Price. Não tenho muito o que falar, é só Life is Strange fazendo o que sabe fazer de melhor: emocionar. Mas esse jogo, por menor que ele possa parecer em comparação aos outros dois títulos principais da franquia, este jogo é grandioso por ter uma protagonista grandiosa. Seu poder, Chloe, é de cativar ao jogador do jeitinho que você é.  Viva pra sempre, before the storm. | I love the original part of ""Life is Strange"" series. As a teenager, I literally admired the atmosphere and soundtracks of the game, as well as its plot to some extent. The way the authors were able to press on the emotions of me as a teenager is truly commendable. Even after going through the first part again as adult, some part of my soul responded to me, although some moments already seemed rather stupid. And yet, these mistakes could be forgiven.
After completing this part of the series, I only had one wish - that the game Life is Strange: Before the Storm never, NEVER existed.
You may disagree with me. And you have the right to do so. Everything said below is just my opinion.
I will indicate what I generally liked: the general atmosphere, soundtracks, graphics are generally pleasant too.
[h3](!) There are spoilers below![/h3]
[hr][/hr]
My English is not perfect, so if you see any incorrect moments here, I apologize. I tried to express my thoughts as clearly as possible.
So, my main complaint about this game is Rachel. You know, in the first part of the game, she was presented to us as an ""angel"", as the most holy and innocent person in this world, as an understanding and kind friend, whom everyone, literally EVERYONE adored. The fact that she died was really very sad and shocked many - after all, the star of the college was gone. Yes, there were moments of hatred towards her. However, they were so few that it seemed as if she was an ideal and beloved character.
Rachel in this part is a selfish, childish, absolutely irresponsible, manipulative and insensitive character. A typical Mary Sue.
Literally from the very first seconds of meeting Chloe, she begins to put pressure on her, manipulate her as she wants, while Chloe herself, desperately needing a friend, succumbs to this. Chloe literally falls in love with this character. And I sincerely wondered how such a disgusting character can be loved.
You will say: hey, but they are 16 years old and they are still children! Everyone behaves like that at that age - it's normal! And I'll tell you: the way this character behaved is not normal. Rachel knew what she was doing. She knew how to put pressure on Chloe. She knew that Chloe would be dependent on her and would run after her like a devoted dog.
And in this case, Chloe was always blamed for everything, literally EVERYTHING, even when it turned out that Rachel was actually to blame for something that happened. Chloe was just a scapegoat, and Rachel is always a saint.
The way she put pressure on Chloe when she expressed indecision about leaving their hometown disgusted me. Rachel did not think about the possibility of restoring the family, did not think that perhaps Chloe would want to restore the family, no. Everything is bad for her - therefore everything is bad for everyone.
The moment when Chloe tried to show sympathy and support also caused sincere anger in me. If you remember, Chloe tried to give Rachel a bat at the junkyard to let out her anger. What did this girl do? She was rude to her. That's all you need to know about this character. [spoiler]An ungrateful piece of sh*t.[/spoiler]
Speaking about restoring the family - if in the first part David was presented to us as a bad character, then in this part I will argue with it. He really tried to help, he tried to be a good stepfather. The only thing is that he, as well as Joyce and Chloe, needed the help of a professional therapist. He really tried, although with very questionable methods at times, yes. However, I still believe that no one in the family tried to understand each other - this is mainly why conflicts arose.
Chloe is going through a difficult period in her life - the departure of her biological father, whom she loved, who was a part of her life. Her rebellion, her desire to express herself and the desire to let out all her pain and sadness can be understood - I think each of us experienced similar feelings. For a teenager, it is especially painful. And in this state, we are always the most vulnerable. And if in the first part Chloe was rude and even rebellious for some, then here we can understand that she is, in fact, a good person, but she need a help (and certainly not in the form of Rachel, who is pushing her to self-destruction). It's just that no one tries to understand how much pain she is in, not even her own mother. Don't get me wrong, I don't sympathize with Chloe completely - she is just as irresponsible and infantile too. But I can understand why she behaves so rebelliously.
Oh yeah, and for some reason the writers of ""Before the Storm"" decided to completely ignore the relationship between Rachel and Frank. They literally behave like strangers with each other, although in the first part they were described as those who have romantic feelings between them. And here is... Nothing? Just - wtf?
I could go on and on about what kind of character Rachel was made into, but that would take too much time. All I will say is that when she died at thr end of this game, I didn't feel sorry for her. I really felt sorry for her when the fact of her death was shown in the first ""Life is Strange"" part. However, this version of this character did not cause any emotions in me at all, except disappointment and anger. This is such an annoying character (even worse than Chloe, which is surprising) All the things she did to Chloe, the way she acted like a hysteric and a manipulator, can't evoke sympathy. Believe me, I tried.
This part basically came out pretty crumpled and even more illogical than the first. Conflicts in some situations just arise out of nowhere and I really wish ""Before the Storm"" had never existed. The developers of this part, apparently, did not understand at all what exactly made the first part so successful. Oh, and I haven't even touched on the plot itself - it also seemed too strange to me. If in the first part the authors tried to reveal other characters as best as possible, then here all we see is the authors' cheap attempts to reach that level. We can talk about this for so long that I'm afraid one review won't be enough.
Honestly, I would rather just ignore this part of the series. And the fact that the authors made a remaster, but did not change the main plot to a more logical one at least at the level of the first ""Life is Strange"" sincerely upsets me.
[hr][/hr]
I really wish I could recommend this game to others. But I just can't. This part was a slap in the face for me as a fan of the first part. Thank you if you read this review to the end and good luck in completing this project if you still decide to do it."

Купил на распродаже за 29 рублей. Как игра, этот продукт ужасно не отполирован. Не хватает заботы о пользователях. Поэтому не могу рекомендовать эту игру никому. При том, что игра вышла очень давно, восемь лет назад, и никто не озаботился сделать игру лучше.
Достоинство (единственное):
1. Музыка
Недостатки:
1. Интерфейс:
а) игра вынуждает пользоваться мышкой, хотя всё управление можно было бы перевести на клавиатуру;
б) в аркадном режиме нельзя выбрать трассу нажатием цифры;
в) по интерфейсу вообще нельзя перемещаться кнопками. На экране диалога тоже можно было бы переводить фокус кнопками. Мышь совершенно не нужна для этой игры;
г) экран загрузки пролетает слишком быстро, а только там показывается экран с назначениями кнопок, и это надо показывать в настройках.
2. Геймплей:
а) не показывают нормальное уничтожение болида, ты просто куда-то не туда попадаешь, тебе сразу бьёт в глаза белый экран с рестартом. Нужна анимация взрыва и облёт камерой, чтобы игрок понимал, обо что он убился;
б) всё время требует нажимать отдельную клавишу для запуска двигателей, что совершенно не нужно и раздражает;
в) в сюжетном режиме на каждую трассу даёт всего 5 попыток, что расстраивает. Для визуальной новеллы можно было бы сделать и бесконечное количество попыток на каждую трассу, так можно было бы хорошо выучить трассу. Или настраивать количество попыток в настройках. За 5 попыток трассу никто не запомнит. А если не получается пройти, выводить кнопку Пропустить ну скажем после 10 неудачных попыток. А учить трассы предполагалось в аркадном режиме, но там тоже 5 попыток на трассу. Зачем так делать?
3. Сюжет:
а) в одном из музыкальных треков звучит фраза: ""I am not insane. Reality one!"" (Я не сошёл с ума. Реальность сошла с ума!) Неужели нельзя было это как-то обыграть в сюжете?"

大多数差评以及开发团队要改进的问题
1、这个游戏这种序章免费（让刚接触这款游戏的人产生很大的落差）他应该把游戏的名称写清楚（这才是游戏名称《Raiders》），而不是免费游玩《Raiders of the Broken Planet - Prologue》
2、刚开始玩这款游戏的时候，常常会因为联机速度慢。而且只要在任务确定界面有任何一个人退出，任务就会被取消
3、所有玩家以及精英兵种的处决机制，类似于划拳一样。你一招我一招。暴露度低的一方必胜（很多新人一进入游戏就被AI暴打的原因。很多人都没有在意到暴露值）
4、没有聊天或者语音，在现在这个时代背景下联机没有交流系统真的是很糟糕的一个问题。经常有些新人联机的时候他不清楚需要做什么，你虽然知道但根本无法告诉它
5、奖励机制。你可能联机打了几十分钟其中有2个玩家都选了武器图纸，只有一个人会获得。另一个人什么都没有。那种失落的感觉，尤其是在联机。打了几十分钟甚至连其他的奖励也不会给
6、入侵玩家奖励机制。（玩家需要阻止敌对玩家完成任务，阻止成功评分、获得奖励。很多时候只差分毫就可以阻止，失败了什么安慰都没有，甚至没有安慰奖，起码给一些金币或1个绿钱币

比较棒的地方
1、优化 优化真的非常棒（我是11年的笔记本电脑  GTX860M没有任何掉帧的感觉非常流畅而且很漂亮的画质）
2、比较独特的PVP模式（在PVE的剧情里，会额外有一名玩家入侵这一局任务并和AI阵容一起阻止敌对玩家）
3、个性化的技能搭配，以及帅气的角色（每个角色都有独特的地方，没有冲突或者没用的地方）

虽然它目前有些问题，但就像我前面说的，你会喜欢，或者你不会喜欢。不要早早的下结论。
我希望这个游戏将来会改进我上面说的那些问题，也希望官方出一个的中文语言。那样销量可能会更好一些。

===============================================================
以上内容都是[spoiler][h1]狗屎[/h1][/spoiler] | ※お薦めの理由・・・後述する致命的な問題点以外はたいへん気に入ったから
※よって、手放しでお薦め出来る訳ではありません

ゲームシステムと世界観の連動に凄くこだわったTPS。公式サイトでは、キャラのバックボーンを描いたデジタルコミックも公開されており、その気合いの入りようが伺えます。
無料版を遊んでみて（ミドルスペックPC程度でも遊べた）気に入ったので、思いきってファウンダーズパックを購入。まぁ、後悔はしていません。
シリアス一辺倒ではなく、ケレンミを含んだシナリオも（英語はわからないけど）個人的には気に入った。何より、キャラがとても魅力的です。
問題は、キャンペーンがメインであるにも関わらず、やたらマルチプレイを推奨している仕様ですね。
ラグが致命的な【近接戦闘】を重きに置いている為、マルチプレイ中はどうしてもストレスを感じてしまう。
（coopは数回遊んだだけですが）４人coopならまぁ、楽しめない事はないでしょう。ラグのおきないメンバー揃えればいい訳だし（私には無理なので未確認だけど）。
でもコレ、（一応公式が謳っているのだけど）【4vs1】での戦闘を推してるんですよね。coopで始めても他のプレイヤーが敵側として乱入（セッション開始時）してくるという・・。
よっしゃ、今日はcoopで頑張るぞ！って開幕エモートきめた直後に、敵プレイヤーから何度もリンチされた時には、流石に萎えました。（不理解だった私は最初、アレ？なんで名前が赤いプレイヤーがおるん？・・って混乱した）
せめて、【PvP】要素は”あり/なし”選択させてほしかった。
キャラを強化出来る【カードガチャ（試してないけど、恐らくガチャ）】があるんですが、これを引くには、coopでしか入手出来ないポイントを溜める必要があります。
ソロだと、折角の拡張要素を楽しめないんですよね。coop限定の演出なども異様に凝っていて、どんだけマルチさせたいのよ、と。
とっ捕まったら即死亡の近接仕様は、個人的には嫌いではありません。モーションも演出も格好いいし決まると気持ちいい。
ですが、【PvP】では話が別です。
coopでの残機共有や、リスポン回数使い切っても、仲間の強襲艦到着まで持ちこたえれば残機再装填という面白い仕様も好きですよ。
ですが、【PvP】では話が別です。
各マップのミッションギミックも嫌いではありません。むしろ楽しんでいます。機銃で敵を掃射したり、即死レーザーを避けつつ進んだり、エリート脳筋兵士とDEADorALIVEしたり、エリート女スナイパーと追いかけっこしたり、凄く楽しいです。
ですが、【PvP】では話が別です。
【対戦】と【共闘】の住み分け、【ソロプレイ】の待遇改善を切に望みます。 | Spacelords as a concept is a very interesting game. You have interesting characters, good animations, good voice acting, etc. This game has the makings of everything it takes to make a good game. Unfortunately Mercury Steam made the terrible decision to have forced PVP in a PVE game with no way to turn it off. What could have been a good game is plagued by the most inept attempts at fundamental video game design, again from forced PVP, to having no in game chat option to communicate with your team. This game brings the fun relaxation of an online coop game, but swiftly ruins it with a PVP system that is flawed in almost every single way. Being able to invade a mission as an antagonist and picking on players who just picked up the game and have no real chance at going toe to toe with a Spacelords veteran is a real good way to cut the head off of any future gamer prospects. The mode needs to either be optional, or removed entirely. I would give this game a positive review if it looked like the developers were making any real effort to fix the ongoing issues with this game, but I don't think they will. If you have gone this long without playing Raiders of The Broken Planet, than you can afford to never play Spacelords. | Habiendo participado en la beta cerrada, en la beta abierta y comprado el Founders Pack, tengo de sobra para comentaros.
Primero, aunque el juego sea brutalmente bueno es posible que actualmente los modos de los que dispone (misiones con historia en cooperativo y modo antagonista/invasor de misiones) no sean del agrado de todos. Hay quien no aguantará el carácter competitivo del juego y que no quiere adaptarse al innovador manejo, y esas personas siempre podrán salir de esta página de Steam, comprar otras alternativas novedosas o seguir comprando las secuelas de los mismos juegos año tras año.
Dicho esto, el sello de calidad de MercurySteam reluce por todo lo alto:
- La dificultad te obliga a usar los medios a tu alcance para trabajar en equipo, el antagonista (un quinto jugador que puede o no aparecer en tu misión) varía esa dificultad en función de lo buenas que sean sus tácticas de sabotaje.
- Los diseños son exquisitos así como las animaciones y entornos.
- Hay skins de pago para quien guste (si no te gusta no las compres, no son necesarias para disfrutar del juego, y ya se mostraron ahí durante las betas, aunque quién sabe si decidirán ofrecerlas como recompensas de juego en un futuro).
- Las misiones son suficientemente extensas, variadas y divertidas como para no resultar repetitivas aunque las juegues varias veces para farmear puntos, medallas y monedas en el juego. 
- El matchmaking funciona perfectamente (comprobado en stream en directo).
- Las primeras dos misiones que conforman el prólogo (un tutorial y una misión de tres fases completa con ambos modos online incluidos) son gratis.
- Quien quiera jugar a las misiones de la primera campaña/temporada podrá pagar 10 euros/dólares/libras por ella o ser invitado a misiones de pago por jugadores que hayan obtenido unos tickets especiales en un futuro, y además el Founders Pack precompra todas las campañas/temporadas y da acceso anticipado a los nuevos personajes de cada una 10 días antes de que puedan comenzar a desbloquearlos el resto de los jugadores.
- Por si esto fuera poco, MercurySteam es fiel a su audiencia y nos han demostrado día tras día durante el desarrollo que toman en serio cada sugerencia que se les haga por sus foros del juego o en su servidor de Discord (e incluso en los vídeos que subas a internet y que ellos buscan), estando abiertos incluso a nuevos modos de juego. Esto último se traduce en que Raiders of the Broken Planet no sólo tendrá nuevas campañas cada pocos meses (de esto nos informaron los desarrolladores hace poco tiempo), sino que además continuarán mejorando el juego siempre que se les continúe apoyando en esta aventura que han embarcado como estudio independiente.
Si eres un auténtico PC Gamer, cualquiera de estas o más razones debería bastar para recomendar este juego en Steam. De lo contrario, si prefieres lloriquear por que de momento haya skins de pago en este juego, si no eres capaz de aprenderte los controles, si vas a despreciar haber participado en el desarrollo como beta tester porque no te regalen más personajes de golpe en la versión gratis ""Prologue"" (no compares un testeo beta para desarrollar un juego con los otros testeos beta de los AAA que se usan como excusa para no sacar una demo en condiciones y para revisar el funcionamiento de los servidores), por favor, piénsatelo un poco más antes de valorar negativamente en Steam. Hay miles de juegos en Steam que merecen tu pulgar hacia abajo y si lo usas aquí, en un juego que sabes de sobra que no es malo, te aseguro que no vas a lograr que mejore NADA del juego.

¡Nos vemos en el planeta roto, Raiders! | Short Version: 
Give the Free Prolouge a try, you'll either like it or you wont. A mixed mechanics from multiple 3rd person shooters with added new/unique aspects. A breath of fresh air in my honest opinion when all shooters now are fps and or ""mobas"". Simple but effective character kits that get the job done, if you know how to play em but at the same time says this is this character and what they can do, but more then just run and gun.

Long Version:
they're are several things to point out about this game-
1) The free part of the game is the prolouge (as stated on the store page), not a demo, all items currency and other objects are retained and accesable after purchase of at least one campaign

2) This is is raiders of a broken planet not (insert game name here), so dont tell people to go play said game instead, you could compare this game to others of course, but fanboy/girling about a diffrent game is not helpful to reviewing and aiding in others possibly joining the game.

3) Both the prolouge and the first campaign are just part of the game are just part of the game there is more to come

4) Need to pay attention to mechanics on missions not everything is just kill with a gun, several missions have parts where you need to execute a certain mechanic such as collecting aleph via melee kills one certain enemies to activate an obeject, failing to do so could not only prolonge the match but cause an antagonist and or npc's the chance to overwhelm the party. also every character uses stamina a lil didfently so learn your character. another item to know is the ability to respawn is recharged after hitting 0 if you hold out for the npc to get more aleph so dont leave the match thinking you'll loose in mid game.

5) Melee is a rock paper scissors system: all players, antagonists, npcs bassically have it, if you learn it and practice it, like anything else you'll get good at it like anything else, it's not op just mechanics

Pros:
-Unique characters: all characters are a lil diffrent from each other tho take from basic pen a paper mechanics. all have assests and defects to add to a team.

-Multiple mission goals/mechanics: Not every match is just mow down the enemy. there are capture points, boss fights, escorts, overload the core/bomb, protect an object/person, and mechanics to work with em in each mission.

-Customization: Tho limited as of right now you can customize a characters kit or load out to slightly change their play style to better suit your's via in game currency. (side  note there are skins unlockable via real currancy as of the moment)

-Antagonist mode: Allows you to play against a party as the villian/enemy via the characters you have unlocked, gives a diffrent perspective on each mission, but is double edged. it both feels good to take down an enemy player amongts the npc hoards and boss battles, but can also be a challange if they are not only good but smart adding an extra level of difficulty to a level both new or old.

-Interesting story: Tho limited at the moment if you read, watch and pay attention to not only the ciniematics but the logs in the universe tab, it gives alot of insight to the lore of the game that is quit capatavating in my opinion.

-Style: Both serious and humorius. the art syle remind my a lil of a gorillaz like design for some of the characters which is nice. these are not your typicall front page models  with guns you find is most games and movies now a days, theyre rough n tough tryin to survive on a broken planet. the mix of scifi, mystic (tho only show breifly), and ancient tech is a nice blend upon the man made structures to the decaying lands and and abandoned ruins of this.

-In an out: can basically can just jump in play a few matches (depeding on que and completion time) and jump out

Cons
-Low pop (currently)/que times: dispite several other reviews matchmaking is ""working"" as of writing this review. in my experience it takes 3-17 min to get a match/team depending on the time of day, if solo, in a party, and the map, and antagonist que in too. but people do leave ques, lobby, mid match due to either being afk thinking they'll lose (both on antagonist and raiders side), disconnects and such. at the moment the fastest is the prolouge as its free and where most of the current pop will be, but latley ppl have been expanding to the the campain.

-Antagonist mode: tho i truly do enjoy this aspect of the game as it not only adds an extra level of difficulty for the raiders side depending on the player, if said player leaves it's an automatic win which is double edged, as with current pop ques may be long so if you dont ""complete"" the mission you dont progress even tho you won the mission due to the antagonist leaving. you'll also need to level up your antagonist rank to build certain if not all weapons as of writing this review.

-No co-op que. it'd be nice to just que up with your party wether its 2,3, or full with out having to match for the missing slots, or just to play with out the woory of an antagonist sometimes.

-short: tho the content is repeatable (an antagonists make each match a lil different), for me it as deffinetly left me wanting more, not only in story but in missions, to raid more.

-communication: no real ingame chat or speak currently implemented to communicate more detailed items, or just to chat. only a sytem of calls/shouts/signals and emotes.


mixed/misc items
controls: it takes a lil geting used to and seem a lil odd at first, but it does flow nicley once you get used to em, especially on a gamepad/controller in my opinion.

rewards: at the end of the mission u get 3-4 items every time win or lose. x amount of factions, x amount of character points, x amount of gold, and a blue print depending on how the party did. the thing is you have to choose 1, and if 1 or more players choose the the same item it's either split equally or if its the blue print it spins the bottle and who ever it lands on gets it. i both like an dislike this as it make it a lil realistic as its sayin this is what you all go split it amongs your selves, but can also cause the grind to lengthen.

Campaigns released seperetly: though the over all current purchase of all pipline season 2017 campains amount to 40$ or less if u only buy parts at 10$ per, the inital release of just the proluge and 1st campaign has left me wanting more, not later but now. but at the same time depending on reviews and feed back via this first campaign it could provide the developers a chance to tweek the upcomping portions in part instead of the entire game as a whole. 



overall in my opinion it's a good game that has alot of potential, mixing alot of aspects of several other 3rd person shooters of the same genre while adding it's own mix, and i'd like to see where it goes."

You need a mod to have decent control of the video player. Seeing as this is the core of gameplay...it fails.

Nothing else about the game matters. Scrolling through without a mod is painful. The story starts out interesting but becomes a lazy trope quickly. The ending is modern trash, about forgetting the part of your past that is inconvenient.

This game is forgettable trash, made by a team that has no concept of what makes good game play. After 44 years of playing games...this is a stinker. | A compelling premise ruined by a terrible control scheme.

The gimmick is that you're searching videos via words in their subtitles.  The problem is, there is no button to go to the front of the clip.  You have to manually rewind it at a maximum of 3x speed.  But there's more! These are local copies of Skype calls, meaning you'll need to piece videos together based on their overlap to get the whole conversation.  Which means you will spend roughly 50% of your in-game time watching videos rewind at 3x speed.

There is allegedly a mod that adds a few controls, but it's not on ModDB or NexusMods.  After 45 minutes, I gave up.

Skip this one.  Her Story and Immortality are both better."

Die Story hebt sich ab von anderen Spielen in seiner Art.
Das Spiel bleibt ernst und es versucht nicht auf Krampf depressiv zu sein, was mehr sehr gefällt, da andere Spiele die Stimmung kaputt machen, indem sie genau das Versuchen. Die Balance wird sehr gut gehalten, zwischen Story, Artstyle, Texte und Musik. Das ganze Spiel ist ein Meisterwerk, auch wenn ich ein paar Probleme darin sehe.
Zum einen ist das Thema sehr sensibel und man sollte aufpassen, wie man es verpackt. Als Beispiel, sind die zwei bad endings nicht die Schuld des Protagonisten, wo man sich dann die Frage stellt, wie gerechtfertigt das Ende ist und ob sowas schnell in echt passieren kann. Es ist zwar auch wahrscheinlich gewollt, aber meiner Meinung nach, kommt man zu schnell zu den bad endings. Aber trotz dieser kleinen ""Probleme"" meinerseits ist das Spiel genial. Gerade das Ending ""Hope"" erreicht man auf einem sehr schönen Weg. 

Also mein Fazit zum Spiel ist sehr gespalten. Zum einen kann ich das Spiel nur empfehlen aber auf der anderen Seite, sollte man die bad endings nicht zu ernst nehmen, im Sinne von, dass das so schnell gehen kann. Wobei das good ending wirklich darauf beruht zu helfen. Es ist besser zu verstehen, wenn man das good ending durch hat.

[i]     [/i]从春节前刚上线steam就开始肝起，玩到现在感觉欧服总体福利、爆率都稍好些。100抽送了个大天狗，花了20天左右抽满。有个好的狗粮式神还是帮前期省了不少心。steam内测时出了两个付费包。拿30元为例，送你53魂玉、1个内测头像框和200勾玉（记不清了）还是很超值的，相当于买了个新手礼包，所以也并不是网易强行骗钱卖模拟器。当然那个时候完全可以不用买，毕竟你可以等着玩现在的免费版。

[h1]关于中文[/h1]
[i]     [/i]steam版本的阴阳师不出意外是永远不会更新中文的，与其互联的Google play上有人也有请求加入中文的评价，但是客服的回复是""However,if you really enjoy chinese version,please kindly download'阴阳师',or you may just select chat channel 1000~1015 CH to communicate your thought in chinese""，意思是你要玩有中文的话，还是去玩国服。如果玩onmyoji的话也开了汉语聊天频道，关于频道的事后面再说。

[h1]玩欧服阴阳师的人多吗？[/h1]
[i]     [/i]这个我之前也很好奇，也是驱使着一直玩下去的原因。就目前来看，平时活跃的频道1~7，每个频道700人再加上一些喜欢清静去其他频道的，总体大概6000人左右的活跃人数，对一个手游来说还算可以了。主要的人群分为海外四大洲喜欢中日文化的、少数在app市场猎奇的、和一些华裔、海外留学生以及我这样国人觉得好玩跟着玩的。现在外服排名前几的大寮都是华人组建的。游戏里华人不少，你英语不好也不用担心，他们还是很热情去帮你适应的。[spoiler] 顺便说一句留学生都好有钱[/spoiler]

[h1]外国人对阴阳师的评价如何？[/h1]
[i]     [/i]刚刚问了下游戏里加的那些外国朋友，他们对阴阳师这款游戏的评价还是非常高的。打破我们平时的认知是:很多外国人并不喜欢为手游冲太多钱，因而很多外国朋友对这种F2P、刷刷刷、慢慢变强的游戏模式赞不绝口。甚至很多人的页面签名就直接说零氪玩家，得了很多SSR，让人满足。而且外服还有很多老外登上阴阳师就是为了在公频聊聊天，放松心情，这样的贤者模式也令他们很喜欢。

[h1]关于欧服阴阳师版本[/h1]
[i]     [/i]欧服刚出的时候版本很老，是妖刀刚出掉率加倍的版本。但是更新的超快，现在已经到一目连和彼岸花了。steam和其他可以互联的平台如google play、FB等的更新时间也都是完全一致的，不会因为是电脑模拟器而有延迟。steam版本刚出的时候有很多问题，比如右上角有手机电量、不能进行每周分享等等，但是个人感觉steam网易客服[spoiler] @花城大盗[/spoiler]还是挺有心的，把这些bug都反馈了然后调整和修复。比如设置1000~1015频道为中文频道就是对相关的国人评测求中文的回应。不过这游戏主要面向海外的，所以我感觉也能接受。如果你执意要中文的话，还是去[url=https://yys.163.com/index.html]网易官网[/url]下阴阳师。毕竟游戏面向海外，交流都是用英文，里面词汇也很简单不难看懂。

[i]     [/i]现在感觉每周都会有大更新，相关的内容会在[url=https://www.facebook.com/Onmyojigame]官方的FB[/url]上提前公布。玩起来的心情就是每周都有新内容很新鲜，但是肝又疼的更厉害了..现在彼岸花刚出又得去练般若，实在是练不过来。当然外服也有很多氪金大佬，现在斗技高端局基本上就是那些大佬的天下了。如果你现在开始玩，也不要紧，从注册起一个月抽满120抽送个ssr，祝愿大家都能中天狗、茨木渡过前期。

[h1]关于氪金[/h1]
[i]     [/i] 阴阳师现在被人不齿的原因正是因为游戏骗氪，而且氪金又不能让你变强。但是有些月包什么的又令人感觉非氪不可。所以给个外服的价目参考表[以评测日2018.5.18日汇率计算]:

[h1]关于现在还有的BUG和技巧[/h1]
[i]     [/i] [2018.5.18]不能自由缩放窗口; 不能地图定位导致你pc不能做逢魔之时。

[i]     [/i]欧服的时间是按东部标准时间EST计算，麒麟与阴界之门一般是我们早上8点开始。逢魔之时是晚上11点开始。斗技早上1点-3点和8点-10点，协作斗技的是3点到6点。这种凌晨打的我都没打过，逢魔一般早上刷牙的时候刷下，然后8点时候再去挂下麒麟什么的。

[i]     [/i] 因为现在pc端没有地理位置定位所以想打逢魔的话就必须要下载手机端并绑定了。安卓手机端挂VPN在goole play搜索onmyoji即可，苹果的请注册一个美国的账户然后在app store搜索onmyoji下载即可，装好了绑定steam账户时也要开下VPN，之后玩就不需要了。FB版本没有玩过，就不评价了。

[i]     [/i] 如果你之前预测时候买过内测版本，因为游戏可以创建两个号一个ios、一个安卓[都在一个区是互通的]，神器你买的30块内测礼包两个号都会有。所以你可以把两个号互加好友，一个号买好友魂玉礼包送给另一个号，算是一个小技巧了。如果你买的是200块的豪华内测包，互送礼包的奖励那还是很可观的。当然你后面充值魂玉只能在一个号上加，另个号是薅不到羊毛的。

[h1]总结[/h1]
[i]     [/i] 所以虽然网易把阴阳师推上steam总感觉有点不舒服，但是玩起来感觉还好。主要各方面都比我那以前的国服非洲人号要舒服点了。此外和老外交流，他们对游戏方面不怎么热情，对各种八卦时事热点倒是聊的挺欢，平时看看还挺有意思的。因此无论是作为休闲聊天软件，还是作为其他游戏后放松的抽卡模拟器，阴阳师上线steam还是有一定意义的。如果你想来喷网易垃圾的，隔壁上架的光明大陆赶紧去占个评测坑，那玩意才是真正的纯属骗钱。不过如果真心要玩这个游戏的话，还是请去国服玩原汁原味的阴阳师，毕竟新ssr面灵气是我大香菜配的音~~~

之前还表扬了一下，可是网易不争气啊，这个月上四个新SSR这真的不是骗氪吗？

[h1]8.3日更新[/h1]
一千小时留念[spoiler]不过手机上玩的时长应该比电脑多的多[/spoiler] | This game is currently available for free on iOS, Android, and Facebook Gamesroom. The steam version is $4.99 and comes with a cosmetic portrait frame, 1 mystery amulet, and 100 jade. Not exactly a value in any way, so if you are interested in checking out the game I would try it out on a free platform first. The game works fine for mobile, Gamesroom tends to be pretty buggy.

EDIT: they added 53 S Jade (premium currency) to the purchase, so it sweetens the deal a bit.

- The steam version can be linked with your iOS or android copy of the game, so no need to start over.
- Compared to Gamesroom, you cannot ""maximize"" the window in the steam version but you can click and drag to increase/decrease the window size
- Upon game start in Steam the window size will default

If you're interested in an actual review of the game itself this game has been out a while in Asia and has a pretty large following. Its basically your run of the mill gacha game that involves collecting, leveling, and evolving monsters in the vein of other popular games such as Puzzles & Dragons, Fate Grand/Order, and Fire Emblem Heroes. If you love gacha games this is right up your alley. If you don't know what a gacha game is you should be able to tell within 15 minutes if this is your cup of tea. | The purpose of this review is to examine the similarities and differences between the Steam version (which currently costs at least $4.99) and the Facebook Gameroom and Mobile versions (which are free). By doing so, I hope readers can make an educated decision on whether or not they should buy the Steam version. That being said, [b]I will not be discussing the pros and cons of the game itself[/b] (if you′re looking for a traditional review of Onmyoji please read my in-depth review [url=https://thegamingfiend.wordpress.com/2018/02/21/onmyoji-review/]here[/url]). 

[u]What′s Included in the Steam Version?[/u]
Two packs are currently available, one for $4.99 and the other for $19.99. The $4.99 pack includes the Kitsune Frame, 53 S-Jades (the premium currency of Onmyoji), 100 Jades, and 1 Mystery Amulet. For anyone curious, purchasing 53 S-Jades in-game also costs $4.99. The $19.99 pack includes the Emerald Plume skin for Kagura, the Kitsune Frame, 225 S-Jades, 400 Jades, and 3 Mystery Amulets. Similarly, 225 S-Jades costs $19.99 in-game. [b]Note that once Onmyoji leaves Early Access in 1-2 months it will be free![/b]

[u]Steam vs. Facebook Gameroom[/u]
As far as I can tell, these two versions are nearly identical. When comparing the graphics of both versions side-by-side, I am unable to perceive a noticeable difference. Both versions also appear to run similarly (as in using approximately the same amount of my computer′s resources). In addition, they possess the same advantages and disadvantages compared to the Mobile version (more on this in the Steam vs. Mobile section below). 

So, what are the differences between the Steam and Facebook Gameroom versions? The obvious one is the different platforms. Using Steam has its benefits (ex. access to Friends list), and while I havn′t personally experienced many problems with Facebook Gameroom, many others have voiced persistent crashing issues with it. Another difference between the two versions is that players of the Steam version have more freedom when it comes to resizing the client. The same aspect ratio must be maintained for both versions, but the Facebook Gameroom version prevents players from reducing the size of the client below a certain point. This is not the case for the Steam version, which players can reduce to a minuscule size if they wish to do so.

On a side-note, players cannot run both of these versions at the same time. This means anyone looking to play two different accounts on the same PC are unable to do so.

[u]Steam (and Facebook Gameroom) vs. Mobile[/u]
[i]As stated in the section above, the Steam and Facebook Gameroom versions are incredibly similar; therefore, in this section, I will be comparing both PC versions to the Mobile version.[/i]

Aside from the obvious fact that the Mobile version is much more portable, the Mobile version actually has two in-game advantages. First, many events can only be completed on the Mobile version (attempting to do so on the PC versions will yield a message to try on the Mobile version instead). Second, players on the PC versions are limited to the number of times they can participate in each activity in Onmyoji per day (ex. a maximum of 50 Demon Seal clears per day). I recommend readers to look up these restrictions to judge whether or not they will have a major influence on gameplay for them. 

While it′s true the Mobile version is more portable, players of the PC versions can enjoy the benefits that come with playing games on a computer such as a bigger screen, more refined graphics, and the ability to use their physical keyboards (as opposed to the digital one on Mobile). It′s also important to note that Onmyoji will drain a phone′s battery incredibly fast. 

[u]Verdict: Is the Steam Version Worth It?[/u]
I recommend anyone that has already played and enjoyed Onmyoji on either Facebook Gameroom or Mobile who also plans on buying S-Jades in-game to purchase the Steam version. As mentioned in the first section of this now very lengthy review, the two available packs include the number of S-Jades consumers would receive for the same price as their respective packs. For example, if someone planned to buy 225 S-Jades for $19.99 in-game, they might as well buy the $19.99 Steam version pack which not only includes 225 S-Jades, but also other goodies. 

For those that have no intentions of buying S-Jades but wish to play on PC, I recommend downloading the free Facebook Gameroom version instead. And for the Mobile players that aren′t particularly interested in playing on PC, well, rest assured because the Steam version doesn′t offer in-game benefits (it does the opposite actually). | A lot of people are jumping all over this game for being a basic port and costing 5 dollars. I think it's doing a disservice to what this game is trying to be; an incredibly sleek, UI-friendly and player-friendly remix of a tried and true formula, while removing many things that are excessively RNG. 

The game's strongest comparison can be made with Summoner's War. If you know that game, I'll say the ways it's superior:

-Type advantages/disadvantages don't exist. As such, each monster is unique and stands on it's own.
-Monsters can be incredibly unique with endless synnergies. Deciding on a perfect team is as much taste as optimizing.
-Rune sets are much more interesting, and you can only have one active per char with another boosting an attribute. Leveling runes NEVER fails, but you must feed them other runes to level them up (No spending 2 million mana to get a +12, you'll get there eventually)
-Evo dungeons are open 24/7
-Buffs can be PAUSED at will. An hour of bonus EXP lasts an hour of farming EXP. 
-Very interesting lore/storyline, fully acted with some high end VA's (Your pet fox is Tony Tony Chopper!)
-Coop is heavily encouraged, as you get bonuses for every dungeon, it costs less energy AND you get more loot. High levels will run you through them just for the bonus. Downside is you must solo clear to the level you want to farm. 
-When you evolve a monster's rank, they don't go back to level 1, the level cap just extends. 
-Many monsters are not randomly found, but you find shards, and when you get enough you summon it.
-You can summon monsters drawing boobs or worse.
-If your energy and EXP are capped (I.E. you give EXP to a max level monster) a portion is banked to use later, which can be upgraded to better ratios, so you don't feel the need to set your alarm to every 8 hours quite so much or punished for farming with a max level monster.

Disadvantages:
-I ran out of ways to summon decent monsters and also good sources of energy around mid-20's as someone not paying past the 5 dollar entry fee. 
-SSR's (The Nat 5's) are incredibly rare and incredibly powerful. I have not gotten one, and a single SSR on an enemy PVP team can be impossible to overcome through no particular fault in using the resources I got.
-Leveling is really slow, and not nearly as automated. I understand this is to offset not returning to level 1, but it just feels bad and getting new monsters up to snuff is almost impossible until your other monsters are either capped or you stop using them. 
-Farming shards is as tedious as trying to get Mid essences from a dungeon, I.E. knowing it will happen eventually doesn't always mean the journey is fun.

All in all, if you only want to play it a few times a day when energy fills up, it's worth 5 dollars.

The gameplay is easy to understand and easy to master yet satisfying when you win. Not a huge time commitment for each round, but plenty of content to dive into if you so desire.

so what's the problem?

It's a port of a mobile game that has the bait/in game purchases removed but the adjustment that has been made to the reward system is insufficient. So in a game that's designed to have parts that can not be beaten until you attain better units, goading you into a purchase. You are stuck and forced to grind to obtain the ingame currency, which is very very limited unless you are able to win multiplayer matches, of which there are few because the game has so few players.


They have written in updates that the mobile versions have reduced drops, but i've played both and the grind is just as bad on the computer. Really rubs salt in the wound that you paid for a game on faith only to find out there's a free version. I'm not even going to ask for a refund i'm going to leave this review up to let people know to not waste their money.

I hope the devs see this and consider a rebalance of currency, or perhaps a larger assortment of units and cards upon purchase, more frequent drops of rewards. 
I would buy a dozen copies of this game for my friends, but I don't want them to be stuck after the first campaign like I am.

J'adore les wargames. J'ai joué plein de batailles dans mon salon ou dans mon garage, parfois des week end entiers. C'est un ami qui m'a parlé de ce jeu, et j'ai voulu essayer. 6€ ça me semblait pas très cher. Et ça les vaut largement.

J'ai lu des avis de rageux qui ne comprennent pas les dés, ni les cartes, ni la raison de la perte de dés. C'est sûr que s'ils n'ont pas lu les règles (RTFM!!! ou LCPDM en français) ils ne vont rien comprendre du tout et passer à côté du jeu. Donc n'écoutez pas ces avis idiots.

J'ai aimé ce jeu car il est assez exigeant dans la tactique et la stratégie. 
- Tactique car il faut bien choisir ses placements (si je mets mon personnage là, son samouraï devra soit le charger, soit le contourner, ce qui me laissera le temps de redéployer mon archer derrière cette palissade, par exemple.), bien choisir le moment de jouer une carte (si j'attends ce lancé de dé, je pourrais accumuler assez d'honneur pour combiner ces deux cartes, par exemple), bien choisir sa cible (si je focus ce plus faible, je pourrai prendre en tenaille le plus fort et lui faire perdre des dés et du déplacement) etc.
- Stratégique car il faut bien choisir son équipe. J'ai croisé des équipes que de tireurs, ou que de trois gros lourds; bref des équipes dont les personnages s'articulaient mal entre eux, qui ne faisaient pas synergie. De même il n'y a pas de cartes miracles. Dans mon deck j'ai peu de grosses cartes, mais j'ai des combinaisons de petites cartes et ça passe très bien. 

Enfin j'ai aimé car je n'ai rien dépensé une fois le jeu acheté. J'ai fini la campagne, j'ai plus de personnages ""doré"" que j'ai de place dans mes équipes, j'ai toutes les cartes en double exemplaire. Je ""détruits"" mes cartes en trop et mes figurines pas assez rares pour récupérer des poussières et fabriquer ce dont j'ai envie ou besoin. 

Y a que du multi et pas assez de solo, c'est vrai. Mais le temps de trouver une partie j'ai le temps de lire un webcomic. Les parties ne sont pas très rapide. J'ai pas chronométré mais ça doit faire dans les 5 à 10minutes. Mais si on aime les batailles c'est très bien. | I think this game is great except for a couple of things that I feel might make other players not even bother. 

1. Your units don't gain honor (xp) in the single player campaign. I don't really mind playing the multiplayer except that the Arena (which is a second multiplayer mode) doesn't seem to have anyone playing it and after playing 150 hard-earned coins for access I just sit waiting for a player. This also means that the arena quests are mostly worthless as there doesn't seem to be anyone playing. Again, all this would be a non-issue if I could just level up my units in the single player campaigns which are fun (if short) 

2. I don't mind grinding the single player campaigns to get coins through quests/achievements but you only get three quests at a time. One is a regular multiplayer quest (like kill 10 enemies in multiplayer), the second is an arena quest that after the initial one, you will never complete. The third is a single-player quest but there's a catch. The quests require you to complete the same campaign in all the difficulty levels before you get quests for the other two campaigns. When you get the ""Complete Cutthroats Campaign at Insane difficulty"" you will need to have leveled up your units to max level to even have a chance of completing that quest. Since Arena is dead and the single player requires leveled units to complete the quest, you're stuck grinding the regular multiplayer for hours and hours. This gets especially tedious once you've completed 50% or so of the acheivements (which also give coins) 

Since the arena multiplayer community is pretty much dead, this ends up being a great game that you can't really get all the best from. If the devs would enable leveling in single-player and perhaps add more quests then this game would be on my all-time top 10 pc games. Even then, the single player is so fun that I'd easily put it in the top 20. | THIS GAME HAS NO MEANINGFUL PVE - just need to get that out the way, to avoid any disappointment.
The core of the game is collecting & levelling troops, and PvE doesn't contribute to either (negligible loot & no XP) - in fact, aside from the tutorial, you really shouldn't even attempt PvE until you have PvP'd yourself some stronger troops.

** Pros **
Really interesting videogame concept, well executed with a very nice price point.
The game is heavily random (as dice based), but there's nonetheless plenty to do strategically.
The PvP seems to be very pick-up-and-play; you don't have to socialize and there's no chat.

** Cons **
Seeing as how quick PvP skirmishes form the bulk of gameplay, it gets pretty repetitive for a game that needs to be played a lot to make progress.
While well presented, afraid I just found the setting & units very bland and hard to distinguish; there's no fantastical units (e.g. sorcerers or oni), no ninjas, or even simply unique characters - nor is there any world-building of note.

In conclusion: excellent value 'hobby game' if you are in the market & don't want the temptation of microtransactions, but don't expect memorable PvE or story-telling - really hope that the developers plan expansions, or to use this engine/model for miniature games in livelier settings."

补充：实际上直接找到游戏文件夹（STEAM-库-Prismata-右键-属性-游戏文件夹，把steam彻底关闭退出后台，直接运行游戏，不会调用steam，不计时...... | As someone who can only play StarCraft 2 with ~50APM and failed to defend fast pool everytime, I really love Prismata. A very complex and interesting turn based strategy game. Even as a professional mathematician, I find puzzles and matches in this game deep, hard and very exciting. Different from most of the modern card/turn based strategy games, this game has almost no RNG (except the coinflip in the beginning of each match, and randomized advanced units, which are the same for both side), and all information is open to both side, so calculation and prediction play very very important role here.

The learning curve is somehow steep. More or less like a good RTS game, there are things to memorize: common openings, tricks and trades... But luckliy, there are very good articles about these aspects already: google Prismata library. Once you get over the basics, every game becomes very exciting and unique.

That said, this game is not for everyone. It is for those people who like rigorous strategy and calculation, and hate the gamble effect RNG brings. A very unique game, also well polished. And somehow to my surprise, the in game chat and the community is very friendly, helpful and very warmful towards new players. 

 | This game is the absolute pinnacle of turn-based strategy. It is really a surprise I only heard about this game now, a few days after the release on steam, even though the game has existed for over 3 years I heard. And why you definitely SHOULD buy this game? Here are a few examples of my reasons behind my decision to get Prismata:
- I like chess, I've played HS, Gwent, Duel of Champions, Fire Emblem and loads of other different turn based strategy games, but I have never come across anything like Prismata before. The combination of no RNG(apart from coinflip, which has around the same effect as chess) and very complex game mechanics which need to be perfectly executed or you literally can lose instantly, really creates a very competetive and interesting game environment, where you always feel you can improve gameplaywise after any given game.
- Prismata has been made super-indie, by only a couple of people and because of that has a completely different mindset compared to for example Duel of Champions, which is another game I also loved, although it was shut down by Ubisoft. The developers have clearly emphazised how much it means for them to create a no-p2w environment where you don't have to grind for the cards, or anything, although this is not a card game but a resource management game. Completely opposed to for example the ""pay until you are broke"" - method which sounds like to be the monetization option for Valve's newest ""strategy"" game Artifact and many other similar games in 1v1 strategy genre in general.
- The developers have come up with a really clever solution to prevent the game from every getting solved, or repetitive, as the available ""card"" pool for both players is partly randomized every game. And yes for both players means both players have the same options, in every game, negating most balance issues with cards being overpowered or too weak, as you cannot choose what to take with you ingame.
- The lack of deckbuilding was a weird thought for me at first, but it actually is the perfect solution for any game like this. The reason why card games or other strategy games which involve deck building of some kind get tiresome rather quickly, unless new cards are added very often, which has its own issues with balancing and older cards getting useless and price for new players etc. Although I repeat, this is NOT a card game even though it maybe might seem like one when you take a first look at the UI, I feel that comparisons to popular card games work well with this game, as the strategy is in the end somewhat similar, just without the surprise factor of your opponent having a hand you cannot see. When the options are open to inspection for both players, the mindgames really kick in. And as every game is different and you have to figure out a new strategy for every given game, and also look out for what your opponent is doing, the game will never feel stale!
- Since steam release although the success isn't like HS level, I have had no trouble finding opponents when queueing. Also the AI is really challenging and the single player missions are already so difficult that it feels like they have a lot more content than they  actually do, funnily enough. I like the art style of the game even though I have seen many people calling it ""cheap"" or ""mobile like"", but tbh I think for such a small development team the art style is more than good enough, and main plus I'd say every unit at least feels unique and distinct, thanks to the artwork.
- Main positive is the mechanics though, but explaining all those in a single review might take a little too long, but I just say that after turn one, literally anything is possible. The units have cool combos and setting up situations where you will end up ahead in the long run is crucial to winning any game, and the key is WHEN to do things or not.

Negatives:
-Price of the game can feel a bit high (around 21€ for me with the first DLC) but it did feel worth it for me after I played a while. The game will likely be free to play some point but I wouldn't wait for it as the founder edition has some cool bonuses, like letting you unlock the various skins and other cosmetics for the units a lot easier. Talk about supporting a great game!
- The skill ceiling is REALLY HIGH, like yeah this game is not for everyone, it can feel overwhelming without any experience about these kind of strategy games, and it will take a while even for more experienced puzzle solvers like me to get the hang of it. But if you feel like you are up for a challenge, you will get it.
- If you require GWENT level of art, then maybe this game is not for you. | 卡在界面进不去，开加速也不行，希望官方能提供一个解决办法，不止我一个人遇到了。游戏先好评支持了。 | Summary:  Prismata is turn-based Starcraft meets Magic: the Gathering.  It's recommended if you like the resource management and build optimization of Starcraft, but find unit micromanagement frustrating.  Also recommended if you like the tactical gameplay of Magic: the Gathering, but dislike the cost of collecting cards and dislike games being determined by which player draws the right cards.

Pros: 
- Deep and unique strategic gameplay
- All players on an even playing field
- Every game plays out differently
- Excellent, non-cheating AI with a broad range of difficulties
- Rich support for competitive play
- Very affordable

Cons:
- Small, hardcore playerbase
- Sometimes makes me feel dumb
- Skins only obtainable through a microtransaction slot machine

Prismata is one of those rare genre-innovator games for which it is difficult to make direct comparisions to other games, but which is, in retrospect, surprising that something similar hasn't been done before.  The best summary is ""Starcraft, the card game.""

Over the course of a match, you and your opponent will take turns building units by spending resources in exchange for playing cards to form a tableu of units, selecting some units to attack your opponent, and managing your defenses.  However, instead of playing units from a hand of cards, they are built from a card pool which allows all units to be built at any time, provided you have the required resources available.  This unit pool of fifteen to twenty-two units is randomly generated at the start of each match from a library of more than one hundred options, changing the optimal strategy each game, and rewarding the player more able to adapt their own strategy to the available choices.

The units themselves are purchased using five different categories of resources.  At the start of a match, you start with two engineers, which produce energy, and a handful of drones, which produce gold.  (The first player gets six drones, and the second player gets seven.)  You can use energy to produce more drones, and use gold to purchase other units and structures.  These structures produce additional red, green and blue resources, which are further required to buy more advanced units.

Some units are purely economic, others can attack your opponent, others defend against attacks, and some can do both.  Many of the more expensive units have an ability which you can choose to activate once a turn, perhaps spending some resources, perhaps making that unit unavailable to defend, in exchange for some positive effect.  The five categories of resources, the wide variety of units with unique effects, and the attacking and defending phases bring to mind Magic: the Gathering as a gameplay comparison.  However, unlike Magic, the same units are available to both players during the game, and unlike Magic, there is no need to buy card packs in order to get access to units.

Because the only randomness during the match is the selection of units available, and because the same units are available to both players, the winner of a match is determined only by he who makes the best decisions.  This can be very rewarding when you win, but when you lose, there isn't anything to blame but your own poor performance.  This isn't Hearthstone, where you can shift the blame to the random number generator.  This isn't League of Legends, where you can scapegoat your teammates.

The high learning curve of Prismata and lack of random elements means that acquiring the skills required to succeed against other players can be a frustrating experience.  This is particularly the case because the player population is somewhat small, with less than two hundred players online at any given time, and quite hardcore.  If you are the sort of player that is easily frustrated by losing, this may not the game for you.  However, if you respond to a losing streak by trying to analyze your mistakes and attempt to ""git gud"", to put it in the parlance of our subculture, then Prismata will be a rewarding.

The game does provide the tools for improving your performance.  There is a replay system allow you to review your mistakes and do ""what-if"" scenarios to see if different decisions would have led to better results.  You can also spectate top-level players in-game, making the game itself a rich environment to learn from the best.

Mitigating the initially brutal multiplayer experience is a lengthy set of single-player battle training missions.  These missions walk you through available tactics and strategies for effective Prismata play.  You can expect to spend twenty hours or more progressing through the single player content.  Also available is a very capable AI opponent, with many difficulty settings, which should allow anyone to find the right level of challenge.  

Currently, Prismata is available through Steam for $25 USD, and the value for dollar at that price point is very generous.  However, be aware that Prismata will, in the future, be a free-to-play game with microtransactions.  The full gameplay experience will be available for free.  Whales will be on even footing with the completely free-to-play player.

However, skins for your units are acquired through a microtransaction slot machine which seems optimally designed to bilk the potential problem gambler.  A trifecta of exploitation makes this so:  difficult to estimate probabilities, cognitive biases about loss aversion, and an in-game currency creating psychological distance from real-world dollar value.  Of course, these skins are cosmetic only, providing no in-game advantage, so you are free to ignore them entirely.  But the process of acquiring skins does feel a little slimey.  I'd strongly prefer directly spending money on skins, instead.

If you are interested in Prismata, I would recommend buying in at the asking price on Steam, since it does give you extra single player content, but if you are unwilling to pay the asking price and can't wait for the free-to-play roll out, be aware that sometimes streamers on Twitch have keys to give to new players, and apparently there is a Discord where you can ask for a key and get one.  I've also seen the developer give keys to people asking about the game on the Prismata subreddit."

Jumping right into the game, you'll be introduced to one of the BEST character creators I've ever seen for a anime style game and there are a TON of cosmetics you can get later on. What's even better is that most items from base PSO2 can be transferred to NGS, allowing for a vast amount of customization! Speaking of, all cosmetics appear to be earned in a handful of ways. They can be earned through quests, the player market (if you afford it) or through scratch tickets which is the premium lootbox system. I absolutely LOVE seeing everyone's characters! There are some really interesting ideas running around!

The gameplay feels really good! Combat feels so fluid and really makes me feel like a Shonen protagonist!  Seriously, all of the animations look super appealing! There is a handful of stuff to do in NGS. Though, if it does get too redundant, there is the option to transfer to base PSO2 and there is so much to do that it's slightly overwhelming!

E o que você está disposto a sacrificar por algo maior? É um jogo que não te dá respostas fáceis, mas faz você refletir sobre elas a cada virada de cena.

A jogabilidade, com seus Quick Time Events, pode não ser do gosto de todos, mas tem uma razão de existir ali. Cada toque, cada decisão apertada na tela, te coloca no centro da ação, forçando você a viver o momento. E mesmo que em alguns pontos esses QTEs se sintam mais como uma obrigação do que uma liberdade, é inegável que eles conseguem criar uma tensão constante. A pressão de acertar ou falhar, de agir rápido ou se perder, mantém o coração acelerado. Não é um tipo de jogabilidade que te deixa relaxado, mas é uma que encaixa perfeitamente no clima de uma história cheia de dilemas e reviravoltas.

O que realmente me pegou foi a narrativa. Não é só sobre robôs ganhando consciência, é sobre as emoções que surgem no processo. Kara, Connor e Markus não são apenas personagens, eles são reflexões de nós mesmos, de nossas escolhas, medos e esperanças. O jogo não te guia — ele te coloca em uma sala cheia de portas e diz: ""Escolha qual abrir."" E o que vem depois, ninguém pode prever. A cada nova situação, o mundo se expande, a linha entre o certo e o errado se esconde ainda mais, e você começa a questionar: O que você faria?

O que é ainda mais fascinante é que, apesar de ser um jogo com um enredo pesado e cheio de dilemas éticos, ele nunca te faz sentir que está te empurrando para uma direção específica. Você é desafiado a pensar por si mesmo, a sentir por si mesmo, e isso é o que torna o jogo tão marcante. Embarcar nesse mundo de Detroit é uma experiência que, sem dúvida, vai ficar com você por muito tempo, porque cada segundo vivido ali tem uma profundidade emocional que poucos jogos conseguem alcançar.

Se você está procurando um jogo que te desafie a cada segundo, que te faça sentir uma montanha-russa de emoções e que, simplesmente, seja bem trabalhado em todos os aspectos, Detroit: Become Human é a escolha certa.

游戏里很多“单英文单词”的分支选择翻译是有点问题的，有些直译的很明显，导致我不知道这个选择是要表达什么（导致选错几次，没能选到我想选的），而且有时候能直接看出来这个直译的英文单词是啥，然后还得推测英文单词的英文环境语义才能知道这个选择是要干啥。

总之，上面提的问题在游戏虽然不多，但希望有余力的话还是尽可能优化下。"

Overview: Tomb Raider (2013) is a reboot of the classic action-adventure franchise, offering a fresh origin story for the legendary adventurer Lara Croft. Developed by Crystal Dynamics, the game takes a more grounded and gritty approach to Lara's character, portraying her transformation from a vulnerable young woman into the hardened explorer she's known for. Combining exploration, puzzle-solving, and intense combat, the 2013 iteration offers a blend of action and survival mechanics set on the mysterious island of Yamatai.

Story: The story follows Lara Croft, who, along with her crew, becomes stranded on the island of Yamatai while searching for the lost kingdom of Himiko. The island, however, is home to many dark secrets, including a dangerous cult and other perils that put Lara’s life in constant jeopardy. Throughout the game, Lara faces various challenges and fights to survive, all while uncovering the island’s mysteries and discovering her own strength.

The narrative is engaging, focusing on Lara's personal journey and her development as a character. The story touches on themes of survival, trust, and the cost of discovery, with the stakes rising as Lara delves deeper into the island’s secrets. The characters are well-developed, though the focus is primarily on Lara, making her transformation and growth the heart of the plot.

Gameplay: Tomb Raider (2013) brings a mix of exploration, platforming, puzzle-solving, and combat. The controls are smooth and accessible, with an emphasis on both exploration and action. As Lara navigates the island, players engage in intense combat against various enemies, including mercenaries, wild animals, and the island’s cultists. The combat system is robust, offering a variety of weapons, from bow and arrows to firearms, as well as a range of stealth and melee attacks.

The game also features light RPG elements, allowing players to upgrade Lara’s weapons and abilities as they progress. This adds a layer of depth to the gameplay, encouraging players to explore the island thoroughly to collect resources and improve their equipment. There are also collectible items and hidden treasures scattered throughout the game, rewarding those who take the time to explore off the beaten path.

Graphics and Performance: The graphics in Tomb Raider (2013) are exceptional, with lush environments, stunning character models, and impressive lighting effects. The island of Yamatai is beautifully designed, ranging from treacherous cliffs to dense jungles, all rendered in high detail. The character animations, particularly Lara’s, are lifelike, and the facial expressions convey emotion and intensity. The cinematic cutscenes are integrated seamlessly into the gameplay, making the narrative feel fluid and immersive.

The game runs smoothly on most modern systems, with well-optimized performance. On higher settings, the visuals are breathtaking, but even at lower settings, the game still maintains a high level of quality.

Audio Design: The audio design in Tomb Raider is excellent, with a haunting and atmospheric soundtrack that complements the game’s tone. The sound effects are realistic, from the sounds of Lara’s footsteps on different surfaces to the crackling of fire and distant roars of danger. The voice acting, particularly from Camilla Luddington as Lara Croft, is solid, adding depth to the character’s emotions as she faces peril after peril.

Challenges: While the game is generally well-balanced, some sections can feel a bit repetitive, especially in terms of combat. Some of the puzzles are relatively simple, and while they provide a nice break from the action, they don’t challenge players too much. The difficulty ramps up during some of the more intense sequences, especially during the combat-heavy portions, but overall, the game provides an enjoyable experience without being overwhelmingly difficult.

Final Thoughts: Tomb Raider (2013) successfully reinvents the franchise, offering a modern and more personal take on Lara Croft’s origin story. The game blends action, exploration, and survival mechanics into a thrilling adventure, with a great narrative that makes you care about Lara’s journey. Its visuals, gameplay mechanics, and immersive world design make it a standout entry in the action-adventure genre.

Pros:

Engaging story with strong character development
Beautiful graphics and immersive world design
Satisfying combat mechanics with a variety of weapons
Excellent audio and voice acting
Exploration and collectibles add depth to gameplay
Cons:

Combat can become repetitive
Some puzzles are relatively easy
Certain sections of the game feel linear
Tomb Raider (2013) is a fantastic reboot that blends classic Tomb Raider elements with modern gameplay features. It offers an emotionally engaging and thrilling adventure for players who enjoy action, exploration, and survival mechanics. Highly recommended for fans of action-adventure games and those looking to experience Lara Croft's origin story in a fresh light. | Juegazo al principio no le tenia mucha fe pero despues de jugar un rato descubri que es un juegazo el combate y la exploracion es buenisimo y todos los coleccionables y  mejoras son espectaculares. 10/10 | Гарна та дуже драйвова гра.

Серия начинается со знакомства нас с новой ларой. персонаж попадает сразу в гущу событий, но все происходит достаточно комфортно для игрока. Ребята постарались наж презентацией трилогии - Достаточно достойно прописанный сюжет, качественная работа художников и постепенно, по ходу развития событий, лара превращается из девочки исследователя в боевую самку археолога - приятно быть вовлеченным в происходящее. Еще не успел надоесть сбор непонятных чушек для ачивок, местами чушки так же разукрашивают нам некоторых персонажей или действия прошлого по сюжету (в дальнейших частях хочется просто побыстрее их проскипать, потому что их количество стало ужасно огромным, сложилось впечатление что они весь сюжет решили просто текстом оставить)."

-У своїй довгій подорожі на південь вони двоє проходять через безпритульність, жорстокість поліції, расизм, горе, смерть, втрату, сім’ю, дружбу, доброту незнайомців і яскраву природну красу американської пустелі.

Оскільки наслідки вибору гравця матеріалізуються лише через кілька годин або днів після того, як вони зроблені, ви не можете просто перезавантажити та переглянути інший фінал.

-Висновок
Гра дуже вдало відображає важливі соціальні питання, такі як расизм, політична несправедливість і труднощі, з якими стикаються молоді люди, намагаючись знайти своє місце в світі. Водночас вона підкреслює важливість родинних зв'язків, любові і відповідальності, навіть у найскладніших ситуаціях.
