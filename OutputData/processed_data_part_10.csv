The new ones are prettier but this one is the peak. | I've played every version of Civ and this is the one that I think was best. The expansions and the mods (eg. Fall From Heaven II) added so much as well, but being the last version before hex and 1UPT means it'll always be unique. | Crashes constantly.  Alt-tab locks up my computer and forces me to manually restart it.  This game is wonderful but the steam version simply does not run on current hardware. | [h2] Civilization IV - Непревзойденный эталон [/h2]
Великая стратегия!  Для меня и многих фанатов, лучшая в серии!

Главные плюсы.
1. Множество народов со своими особенностями.
2. Красивая графика даже на сегодняшний день.
3. Развитое древо технологий.
4. Множество зданий и исторических построек.
5. Отличная боевая, экономическая и политическая состовляющая.
6. Обилие ресурсов и их влияние на нации.
7. Великолепное звуковое сопровождение. (Особенно реплики при строительстве исторических зданий и в конце исследования технологий).

Крайне рекомендую! | Variety of ways to advance to your goal is challenging,

76561197992939661,8800,Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword,0.0,Strategy,0,"One of the classics. I think this was the best version of Civ they created. | This game has been a lot of fun for me over the years.  Mods added, it always changes dynamics and strategy and the whotnot. | Every games different, Load a Mod, Select parameters and go. 
Strategise, Conquer, be challenged and just enjoy it, I do, that's why I've done over 4500 hours | Civilization IV is honestly the greatest civilization to exist out of all of them. I only stopped playing it because I felt like I had to play the newer CIV versions. 

BtS expansion without a doubt is how Sid Meier originally conceptualized and is his Magnum Opus. Doom Stacks, Leonard Nimoy technology discovery narration, baba freaking yetu is the CIV IV theme song!!!!!!! So much customization in this game makes the newer versions feel so empty and lackluster. Religion was actually cool in this game and could cause world wars and defined friendships. In the newer CIVs that literally would never happen. The only thing I really liked from the newer Civs is the better AI, district planning, hex tiles, and city states. This game also had the vassalage and capitulation options like where the hell did that go in the newer ones that is one of my favorite features in this game. The graphics in this game are kinda aged but at least it doesn't feel like an 8 bit game and is good enough for 2025.

If you think any other CIV could possibly be better then YOUR HEAD WOULD LOOK GOOD ON A POLE!!! >:3 | lots of cities, lots of monuments,----no national wonders,,,,beware of the stacking of troops......fun vinatge game

Overall though, definitely worth a buy on sale. | Amazing experience.
Amazing voice acting, awesome story, great classic graphics.
Loved it.
Only thing was that you need to fool around with some files to change the resolution and controls, would wish to see some support for a game this popular.

Every mission is unnecessarily drawn out and overcomplicated, allowing only one specific solution.

An absolute blast to play and while i wouldn't play it over the others for any other reason other than the campaign now. Winter assault is still apart of one of the greatest RTS series ever.

I loved the winter themes and the imperial guard were awesome to play and god man the voice acting was so good!!

The graphics, while from an earlier era, have aged remarkably well. The detailed unit designs and atmospheric battlefields still capture the gritty, war-torn essence of the 40k universe, immersing players in the chaos of the far future.

The game’s story and factions stay true to the Warhammer 40k lore, delivering a narrative that resonates deeply with fans. Each faction feels authentic, from the relentless march of the Necrons to the righteous fury of the Sisters of Battle, ensuring that the gameplay aligns perfectly with the dark, gothic atmosphere of the universe.

Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Soulstorm is its vibrant modding community. Over the years, dedicated fans have kept the game alive and thriving, introducing new factions, campaigns, and quality-of-life improvements. Mods like the Ultimate Apocalypse and Unification expansions breathe new life into the game, offering a fresh experience even for long-time players.

For fans of 40k and strategy games, Dawn of War: Soulstorm remains an essential classic, as compelling today as it was at launch. | The greatest warhammer RTS game of all time

Never mind the WW2 setting, if you like real-time strategy or strategy in general, this is definitely a must-play. History buffs will appreciate the attention to detail and many nods to WW2 media such as Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan, as it portrays in part the efforts of the 101st Airborne during WW2. 

It's really nice to not worry about resource farming and just focus on combat. You generate resources by capturing territory, which is something you would be doing anyway. The infantry units are made up of squads which you control in their entirety instead of by individual units, and their AI makes them take cover, go prone while under suppressive fire, etc. Lots of variety in units and everything has a purpose, even builder units are effective (e.g., American engineers can use flamethrowers which are great against infantry and buildings). | If you want a good RTS campaign this is for you, its gameplay mechanics unique over the traditional RTS games of the time. | 거진 20년 된 실시간 전략게임입니다.

Tym razem w trybie single player gracz może poprowadzić do boju oddziały świetnie wyszkolonych Space Marines.

W odróżnieniu od poprzedniej części mamy zdecydowanie większy wpływ na kolejność zajmowanych terytoriów.

Nasze oddziały przed każdą bitwą znajdują się bowiem na statku kosmicznym orbitującym wokół planety, o którą toczy się walka.

Każda misja zwieńczona jest potyczką z tzw. bossem, czyli przeciwnikiem, który jest bardziej odporny na obrażenia i dysponuje potężniejszymi atakami niż większość wrogów.

Wraz z postępami w grze, wzrasta poziom doświadczenia Kosmicznych Marines, dzięki czemu z zadania na zadanie coraz lepiej radzą sobie w boju.

W Dawn of War 2 dowodzimy oddziałami najczęściej składającymi się tylko z kilku żołnierzy, wobec czego autorzy chcąc, aby gracz łatwiej się z nimi identyfikował postanowili je spersonalizować.

Tak więc każdy z nich posiada własną nazwę oraz lidera wymienionego nie tylko z pełnionej funkcji, ale także z imienia i nazwiska. | Great game. One of the WH40k and general best ones. Alows you to make your own pace and tactics. Easy to lern mechanics and lot of options for fine tuning your squads. | New warhammer fan since space marine 2 so this is part of of my crusade into the content and lore with the games (and books and models and painting).

76561197992939661,20570,"Warhammer® 40,000: Dawn of War® II Chaos Rising",0.0,Strategy,0,"The first expansion to Dawn of War II which added one new faction to the roster in the form of chaos and a new story campaign on the Aurelia sector.
On that note, I have mixed feelings about the new campaign. The difficulty curve is rather steep and the new corruption mechanic is kind of pointless because you have to pretty much skip content in order to gain corruption. Either that or purposely equip increasingly cursed items like an idiot.
On the flip side I like the new psyker unit and the new weapons are welcome additions. I even went out of my way to rotate characters around to try the new gear.
Besides that the game is rather janky these days, especially the sound, so I encountered more technical problems that I care to mention. The highlight of the issues was probably bosses pushing Cyrus outside of the level geometry.
Anyway, that's all I have to say since this is an expansion and not a new game. I'm not the biggest fan of this one and I think it's unlikely to change anyone's opinion if they didn't like the base game but I think you literally can't purchase Dawn of War II without all of the expansions anymore so you'll get it regardless. | Отлизанные мужики в силовой броне, пиз****я с другими мужиками в силовой броне с шипами, происходит лютое гачимучи под мега эпичные треки.

Out of all the game this one caused me the least technical issues and it's also the most complete in terms of content so Retribution is the best for playing skirmishes.
Besides that the campaign makes a return with a new party of heroes, this time based off the commander units from the skirmish mode, and the conclusion to the story that started in the first Dawn of War with some pretty cool cutscenes. 
But I saved the best for last: the campaign can be played with all 6 races. They vary in quality but they are all rich on hammy voice acting.
The only issue is that the campaign is always the same with slightly different dialogue. Some elements from skirmish mode are present such as building units but the levels are fairly linear so there's little space for the dynamic battles from actual skirmishes. Also, one of your heroes is always silent and that blows.
In conclusion, I think Retribution is pretty good. It's sad that it never reached the level of polish that Company of Heroes has but Warhammer is obviously more niche than World War 2 so that's understandable."

Personalmente qui mi dividerò in due parti. Mi complimento con l'idea di portare Magic online e dare l'opportunità di giocare in piu persone e da piu parti del mondo (Voto personale all'idea 9.5).
La seconda parte invece è totalmente in disaccordo, poichè il gioco, nato cartaceo, è bello proprio perchè è un collezionabile a cui ci si doveva dedicare anche per plastificare le proprie carte per mantenerle intatte, la bellezza del collezionare e di toccare con mano il proprio mazzo, la bellezza del cercare giocatori disposti a spostarsi per giocare o la bellezza dell' organizzare serate a casa dedicate a Magic, come anche si organizzavano (e si organizzano tutt'ora) giocate a D&D (voto personale negativo 1)

In terms of graphics,, it's timeless. i'm amazed how well the visuals have held up over the years. I think the realism mixed with a distinct art-style is what does it. The not quite isometric camera angle and 3D assets go a long way as well.

Game-play and simulation is what really make SimCity 4 stand out though. You're not just zoning a bunch of RCI and watching all the money roll in. You actually have to be careful and manage your funds or else things will go south quickly. Yet at the same time, it's extremely rewarding to see your city succeed.

You're also provided with a plethora of ways to keep track of what's going on in your city. Not only do you have advisors and graphs; but you also can also turn on a bunch of different overlays to look for pollution, traffic, crime, etc. One of my favourite features though is the query tool. With this you can check how and where residents commute on top of other things.

With Residential and Commercial; not only can you choose 3 different density levels, but you can quite easily control the wealth too. There's also 4 different types of industrial (Farms, Dirty, Manufacturing, and High-Tech) with 2 density levels for all except farms.

I could go on and on about how great this SimCity 4 is but there's just so much. That's not to say it doesn't have flaws though. Vanilla traffic path finding is pretty bad, there are some game breaking bugs, and it just does not like modern computers very much. Fortunately most of this can be fixed with mods and some tinkering.

+ Chess-engine type dynamic AI that has not been surpassed in any other 4X game and plays by the same rules as you.
+ Truly impactful galactic event system that keeps each game fresh.
+ Lots of different strategies to excel in, from influence, economy, diplomacy to war.
+ Actually really nice soundtrack for a 4X game.
+ Ability to create and download custom races and ship styles. (You can totally set up all Star Trek races).
+ A lot of content after 3 expansions, both in mechanics and in campaigns.
+ Well balanced and bug free after many years of community patches.
+ Runs on any computer and looks alright if you max everything out.

Cons:

- it's a game from 2008, expect some really shitty CGI and a lot of videos and UI elements to look a little low-res on modern resolutions.
- No in-game encyclopedia leaves you looking through the included manual, ""Community Edition Guide"" and old forum threads to figure out the intricacies of gameplay mechanics as the game came out before community game wikis became commonplace. 
- Default ship designs are lacking, you are forced to use the ship builder to make optimized ship designs, this can be a chore and will lead to ugly designs if you can't bother to take the time to artfully place the modules.
- Ship designer does not let you modify the auto-generated designs.
- Suffers from the common ""Space is empty"" curse. No actual terrain, lots of uncolonizable planets and just deep space that is not fun or very distinctive either visually or strategically.
- Compared to stuff like Stellaris, planets are mostly samey as well.
- Civ4 style stacked combat system that does not really care for positioning outside of starbases.

 
Overall I would recommend it just for the very tight gameplay loop and good AI leading to very interesting gameplay. | O jogo é desafiador e bem completo. Cada raça tem vantagens e desvantagens e trazem caminhos distintos para a vitória. | Yet another fun 4x game franchise.

tl;dr
""Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes"" is the most recent game, but ""Fallen Enchantress"" does provides a different (and fun) experience at a cheaper price.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Lots of confusion regarding this title. Let me clear it up.

Fallen Enchantress ( [b]FE[/b] ) was released on Oct. 23, 2012.
Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes ( [b]FELH[/b] ) was released on May 22, 2013.
Fallen Enchantress: Ultimate Edition ( [b]FEU[/b] ), released on Nov. 13, 2015, is a bundle of FE and FELH, plus all DLC (dynamic pricing introduced in Sept. 2016).

Note that FELH is a standalone expansion, which means FE isn't required to play it.

Both games are Fantasy 4X Turn-Based Strategy games w/ some RPG flavor. If you like Fantasy 4X Turn-Based Strategy games w/ some RPG flavor, there's a chance you will like them.

I would recommend getting the [b]FEU bundle on sale[/b], which, at the time this review is written, includes:
[list]
[*]Fallen Enchantress (FE) [1.32]
[*]FE Map Pack DLC [Included w/ FE]
+
[*]Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes (FELH) [2.0]
[*]FELH Map Pack DLC
[*]FELH Quest Pack DLC
[*]FELH Loot Pack DLC
[*]FELH The Dead World DLC
[*]FELH Leader Pack DLC
[*]FELH Battlegrounds DLC[/list]

Here's a list of the main differences between the two games:

[b]FE 1.32[/b][olist]
[*] One DLC
[*] One Scenario (FE)
[*] Three types of physical damage & armor (Blunt-Cutting-Pierce)
[*] All armor available to all
[*] Encumbrance (Affects initiative)
[*] Champions acquired through Champion Camps on the map
[*] Influence Resource
[*] Randomized Leveling System
[*] Humanoid Champions only
[*] Global Growth Bonus
[*] No Swarm mechanism (Combat)
[*] Less of everything (Items, Monsters, Quests, Spells, etc.)
[*] Game abandoned by Stardock before [url=http://forums.elementalgame.com/440933/page/2]1.4[/url] was released
[*] Modding scene is dead (but great mods available)[/olist]

[b]FELH 2.0[/b][olist]
[*] Six DLC
[*] Two Scenarios (FE + FELH)
[*] One type of physical damage and armor
[*] Armor Proficiencies for Chain/Plate, not available to all
[*] No encumbrance, but initiative penalty integrated to armor
[*] Champions acquired through Fame Events
[*] Fame resource
[*] Path Leveling System
[*] Humanoid and Monster Champions
[*] Local Growth Bonus
[*] Swarm mechanism (Combat)
[*] More of everything (Items, Monsters, Quests, Spells, etc.)
[*] Game is on life support
[*] Modding scene is on life support (but great mods available)[/olist]

Generally speaking, FELH is the better game, guesstimating 8.8 out of 10 will prefer it. However, FE does provides a different (and fun) experience, mainly because of Champion Camps, Randomized Leveling, Encumbrance, and the Global Growth Bonus. Now, that's hardly all the differences, see links, especially the last one:

At this point, I think I need to end this review like every other review I read on Steam:
10/10 Would give a history lesson in my first review again. | This game tries so hard to be a cross of Civilization and Age of Wonders, and it utterly fails at its goal. The original Elemental was terrible, and Stardock actually recognized that. Their solution? Instead of fixing their shit for free, given that it was a liability that they created, they decided to try to sell the fixes for their problems as a 'standalone expansion', Fallen Enchantress.

I usually find some worth in Age of Wonders-style games like this, but even now, so far after release, Fallen Enchantress is not complete. Age of Wonders, a fifteen year old game, had terrain modifiers in combat. Fallen Enchantress? Nope. Or even if it does, you can't tell - the UI doesn't make that information easily visible to you. It's sad to say, but Age of Wonders read the strategic map better when initializing combat - the field of battle was modeled after the hexes you and your opponents were on in the world map, and so terrain mattered as a result.

In comparison? I tried restarting similar battle scenarios in FE several times. Instead of recognizing that the enemy would be attacking from across a river - a river that, in the world map, impedes your movement if you try to cross it - you get a pond. Over and over again. The game simply doesn't understand the strategic significance of a river.

A pond, people. One that you can go around with ease. What's the point of setting your troops up by a river or on a hill if the game won't recognize the inherent advantages of doing such? Even worse, there's no terrain modifier from defending from a walled city. Instead, you just get a bunch of shit archers when you defend a city. It's not an adequate replacement for four walls and a gate at all. Your city archers can and will get wrecked.

Oh, and Age of Wonders? It allowed you to have walls and gates when defending a city. You wanna garrison the town you're protecting and stick out a siege? No problem!

Not to mention, the spells in this game are in every way less developed than they were in Age of Wonders. Christ on a stick, Stardock, were you TRYING to take features away?

Don't buy this game. Stardock is trying so hard to make good games, but they're just refusing to admit when they need to change their guard. Whatever shitty managers worked on Elemental must have worked on Fallen Enchantress too, because it's still terrible at what it's trying to accomplish. | Don't get this game. If you want a 4x Masters of Magic kinda game, get the ""stand alone expansion"" of this, Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes. It's the same game, upgraded, that actually gets updates. | DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  BUY FALLEN ENCHANTRESS: LEGENDARY HEROES INSTEAD!

Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes contains this game and much more!  Buy that game instead!

Dear Steam:  Why is this even still on here?! | I bought this, the cheap version of FE.  I haven't played the 'standalone expansion'.  I like the game, and I think it's worth ten bucks.  Here's my take on some of the critical reviews and also my reasons for liking the game.

The negative feedback seems to fall into four categories, listed here in order of popularity.  1) you can buy Legendary Heroes so why bother with this?  2) I'm mad at Stardock for re-releasing the revision as a standalone expansion.  3) it crashes a bunch and/or the Stardock login is a pain.   4) it plays weird. 

1)  Sounds great.  Go right ahead. 
2)  I am neutral.  I wasn't around when they did that.
3)  I haven't had a single glitch occur.  It launches for me like any Steam game, no extra login or account needed.
4)  Not sure what this refers to.  The game's style is a little old-fashioned.  It has more in common with the HoMM games than with Endless Legend, thematically.  It doesn't try to do innovative things with combat mechanics or character attributes.  What it does is try to be a complete and coherent fantasy 4x game with good RPG elements.  

Enough of that.  My take on what is good about this game:  It provides a basic fantasy 4x experience, including mana nodes, city management, hero management, side-quests, magic items, cute but dangerous bears, and tactical turn-based battles.  It does this well, and some elements it does especially well.  Choices in city specializing are simpler yet more fun than some big, famous 4x games I could name.

The graphics are nice.  They were outdated even when the game was first published.  But they're nice, slightly cartoony, done in good taste.  Best of all, the screens are not a jumble of colors and patterns that distract the player.   The UI is very responsive and doesn't overwhelm you with overdone, gaudy visuals.  You can make choices and process turns quickly in this game, even if your PC is outdated.

This is a game to play if you like 4x, you like fantasy, and you're inclined to imagine a story behind the events and characters that you control.  It is old fashioned in that your personality as a player, and as expressed through your main character, remain yours.  Evil kings use death magic.  Good kings build apiaries to supply honey to the public.  No bizarre philosophical attitudes to deal with.  I care about stuff that's happening in the game.  I sit back and wonder if I should have my buddy the warrior start learning civic skills and become a city governor.  I'd have to replace him on the combat team but I sure would like a new governor.  Hmmm.  The game is good for exploration of its mechanics.  There's no reason to plow through a session at light speed.  Stop and smell the roses and...errr...the zombies.

The intro scenario did get me frustrated.  The tutorial was fine, but there's this introductory game and it drove me bonkers with quests that I couldn't find the targets for.  Bad dog, very naughty.  No biscuit for you.

The very best thing about Fallen Enchantress is it's the work of Derek Paxton, aka Kael, designer of the old Civ 4 Fall from Heaven mods.  If you enjoyed those, here's your chance to thank him with a ten-spot.  Or more than ten, if you buy the newer version I guess.  Long live King Kael, and may he write many more games for us  [raises tankard and drinks deeply]."

The other benefit is this is great for a LAN party as this game is an amazing multiplayer game offering 6+ AI or human players.  The game is small but nostalgically relevant.  It's a great time with friends and allows for some quick paced Armageddon.  It's really alot of fun and its great to pick up have a couple games to warm up in a game night then move to other games.

Hello everyone! I am an old player who has been playing this game for a long time. I rarely go to the Sky Ladder PK and usually use drones for retirement. The game is indeed a good game, but I have witnessed the inexplicable account suspension!!! I would like to say to customer service or developers:
Firstly, I have been playing this game for so long and have never used any cheating tools to enter the battle platform, not even the human-machine interface!
Secondly, I did use third-party tools when playing this game, but they were also used to clear the storyline mode. But this game has never mentioned that using third-party tools to complete the storyline mode will also result in account suspension, right??? And it's also something I used a long time ago.

Если вам кажется, что жизнь — это боль, просто попробуйте Darkest Dungeon. Эта игра покажет, что боль бывает разной: острая, как критический удар босса, тягучая, как бесконечный гринд, и горькая, как осознание, что твоя лучшая команда сошла с ума в первом же походе. 🎭

[h2]Визуал, ощущение и звук — атмосферно как похоронный марш 🎻⚰️[/h2]
Готическая рисовка, гипнотический саундтрек и диктор, чей голос мог бы зачитывать эпитафию, создают невероятную атмосферу. Смотреть на игру приятно, слушать — тоже, но вот играть… Это уже отдельный вопрос.
[b]Геймплей — „ещё один заход, и спать“ (ложь!) [/b]🔄😵

[h2]Игра — бесконечный цикл страданий:[/h2]
❗️Собрал героев (учёл их страхи, фобии и дурные привычки).
❗️Снарядил их (понял, что денег мало, продал ненужные тринкеты, теперь их не хватает на лечение).
❗️Отправил в поход (один герой впал в безумие, второй едва пережил два смертельных удара, третий просто умер).
❗️Вернулся в город (игровой зал ограблен, лечиться негде, нервный тик у игрока усиливается).
❗️Повторил всё снова (а мог бы заняться чем-то полезным, но нет).

[h2]„Рандом“ и баланс — где правда? 🎲[/h2]
Одни говорят: «всё зависит от удачи», другие — «опытный игрок контролирует хаос». Истина где-то посередине. Когда ты промазал, враг уклонился, а потом вмазал тебе критом — это „игровая механика“. Когда ты сделал то же самое — „баланс“.

but its like an abusive relationship i jjuust keep wanting more, yes one more dd1 run, just one more yeah dude yeah yeaha just onee more broooo just one moreeee fuckk my life FUCKKK WHY ARE YOU MISSING, STOP MISSING YOU PIECE OF SHIT LEPER FUCKING HIT THAT BITCH ALREADY | É de fato um jogo intrigante. Você passa um bom tempo jogando como se ele fosse um jogo qualquer, quando na verdade o rumo que se deve ter é completamente diferente. Darkest Dungeon é uma das minhas experiências mais difíceis que eu tive nos últimos anos com jogos. A jogabilidade é extremamente punitiva, nociva caso não saiba o que está fazendo. Um dos núcleos do jogo, é o dinheiro. É necessário entrar nas missões (dungeons), se importar com fazer dinheiro, sua sobrevivência e ainda completar o seu objetivo. Conciliar todos esses fatores, transforma a experiência em um ciclo maçante de fazer dinheiro e upar personagens para o final do jogo. Penso que essa ferramenta utilizada para ser a ponte principal do Darkest Dungeon, pode ser bem mal vista para quem pensa em zerar o jogo.

Mas, além de tudo, gostaria de enaltecer a arte característica e virtuosa, que transmite perfeitamente a atmosfera obscura das dungeons, da sofrência e do medo. A direção artística voltada ao tema ""Lovecrafteana"", é muito bem feito, principalmente no que se diz progressão visual. Os ambientes se tornando mais medonhas cada vez que você vai progredindo para o final do jogo, a mudança de cores voltadas ao cosmo e carnificina ou até mesmo as músicas que passam de um violino arranhado e agitado para algo mais ""contemplador""

Por fim, vai minha dica:
- Se você quiser uma experiência menos massiva, jogue na dificuldade Radiante
- Caso queira sofrer um pouco mais, tendo que repetir missões para ficar mais forte, jogue na Mais Escura
- E se você for um mutante, jogue na mais difícil mesmo, é uma experiência semelhante a estar em um quarto branco com camisa de força no corpo | 新手上手不难，甚至比月计还简单一些，风格也熟悉，各位主管，司书，管理员必入 | This is a game I played on an off for years, and both loved it and grew frustrated by it as I played.  This last year I decided it was time to beat the game finally, so I dedicated a bit more of my gaming time to it, and feel I can give some fairly informed thoughts on the game.  

Darkest Dungeon has a fun party management system that is well designed and the heart and soul of the game.  Do you select your ranged skills for your Highwayman so he can be in position 3?  Or do you take his pos 1/2 skills and play more of a high risk high reward style of play up front?  Do you put your jester in the back making him a buffing character?  Or do you put him further forward so you can apply bleed and be more of a DPS character?  It allows you to make a lot of different parties in different ways, and as you play you learn what combo's works best for each situation, and which ones you prefer to play.  

The enemies also have positions that work differently for each enemy type, and some of your characters will let you manipulate the positions of your enemies to mess them up or put them in a position for one of your other characters to pummel them into the dirt.   So overall the game play is EXCELLENT.

Where I had my struggles with the game was losing characters.  When I first started playing the game it really hurt to lose that Leper that I had been using effectively for so many dives into the dungeon.  I eventually learned that dying is an important aspect of the game, and if you upgrade your stagecoach you will be just fine.  The death of the characters also adds weight to your decisions in the game.  If you decide to get too crazy with a party/skill composition there is a very real chance you are going to lose some of your characters.  So if you decide to play Darkest dungeon just accept right off the bat that death is part of the grim dark theme of the game.

The other aspect of the game that people may not like is the tone and atmosphere of the game.  It is a grim dark themed horror game.  Horror is not really my jam to be honest, but the game play and how the theme is executed, and the great narration of the game drew me in despite my lack of interest in the horror genre.  

Overall the game play is excellent, and the setting, style and art of the game is unique and intriguing.  I would highly recommend this to people looking for a great rogue like dungeon crawler that stands out in an over crowded market."

It's an RTS, but without combat.
It's a base building game without many structures.
It's a colony sim, where colonists don't really matter.

You build your base near good resources and then pray one of the bots won't claim those resources away from you.
Because when that happens you have no way of reclaiming them.
Add the fact that this game balances the difficulty by giving the bots higher stats (thus making the bot always pick resources to claim before you) and you get a game where you can loose within first 5 minutes of the game with no way of preventing it nor fighting back.
After you survive your first 5 minutes, next you have to sell resources, hoping that the RNG will decide that the resource that you are producing is going to be worth anything.

With the mods there are endless scenarios of victory and defeat. Been playing since 2014, 8000 hours and still play every day over and above my hundreds of other games..... | Плюсы:
+ ии, которого приятно побеждать. Ремонтирующих танкистов игрока игнорит, но при этом свою арту занимает и ремонтирует до последнего;
+ бессмертная пехота у игрока. Выносить точку одним огнемётчиком или сквадом десанта на голову врагам, одно удовольствие;
+ неубиваемая арта. Выдерживает несколько прямых попаданий фугаса;
+ большой выбор сюжетных миссий, наверное со всех предыдущих втв;
Минусы:
- кампании Штурма2 - это безсюжетный набор точек;
- бесконечный респавн врага в сюжетных кампаниях. В 2025 это блин не работает! Зачем вообще мне захватывать точки, если на них прибежит ещё с десяток вражин и приправят это танком? Продвижение солдатиков игрока просто обесценивается этим респавном а дальше середины миссии, накапливается какой-то снежный ком из десятков вражеских танков и пехоты, чтобы просто снести всю мою оборону.

- в миссиях случается внезапный запрет огня, юнитам игрока;
- мультиплеер. 60 минут сидеть на точках или пытатся их отбить, в 2k25 очень скучно. Выдерживаю максимум 20-30 минут и выхожу. Долго и нудно;
- интерфейс сквадов. Когда накапливается под 50 юнитов, левая панелька перестаёт быть информативной и скорее дизориентирует. Особенно когда выделяешь кого-то одного, у тебя этих щитков ещё + 10 станет на каждую единичку пеха.

76561197992939661,285580,ACE - Arena: Cyber Evolution,0.15,"Action, Free To Play, Indie, Sports, Strategy, Early Access",0,"*Quick note - I see a lot of reviews on here with like 0.3 hours played or less. My teammate clocked in 146 hours and I'm over 50 so perhaps ignore the positive reviews that show the person installed it and ran the title screen over people like me that actually put some time in. Sadly the fact this game is even still listed on Steam reenforces the feeling that over the last 2 years Steam has gone from a solid platform for good games into an unchecked and uncontrolled shovelware factory for novice made indie garbage.

Funny a friend introduced me to this game maybe two years back because he was friends with one of the devs. Comically over time said unnamed dev grew tired of some of the BS going on with the leads decision making which becomes a large part of this review.

When I first played the game it was actually fun. There was a lot of potential despite being extremely rough. I was part of one of the first teams to play the game for cash as competitive eSports players, something I hadn't done in a long time. However despite the potential the net code alone made even simple practice with teammates brutal if not impossible.

We gave feed back, the team ignored it. Each release the game got worse and worse with a clear focus on skins, visuals and other garbage they planned to monetize rather than making the game work. Believe it or not the net code got worse as it became clear the team really had no idea what they were doing when it came to networking. So rather than fix the match making and network issues they changed the menus, added new sounds and other pointless crap that didn't matter because you rarely could join a game and when you did you'd probably get disconnected at some point anyhow.

There were so many problems and I wrote about them on my teams website and various other places for the devs to review but jump ahead it looks like they gave up much like the majority of the player base who they alienated during feed back sessions and the tournaments they put on.

All in all it's quite sad to have seen the potential and then to watch them flush it. More so it's incomprehensible they would charge you $208.96 even if the game was complete and rock solid. That's like three or four triple A games or a crappy beater car for an unfinished no name game! | adorei

76561197992939661,291410,Duelyst,0.03333333333333333,"Free To Play, Indie, Strategy",0,"When it comes to Duelyst, the comparison with Hearthstone is easily made. The way you earn cards is the same, the ranked system is the same, the mana system is the same and the way classes work is the same, complete with special power.

However, there's a few very key differences between the two games that make Duelyst less random and, to me at least, more fun: The board on which you play as well as the ability to replace a card from your hand once per turn.

The board in combination with the various cards makes for some really deep and satisfying tactical play that allows you to bend the game to your favour with smart decisions. Every turn the board looks different as there's so much going on and every turn has a very large amount of decisions that you can make. I really enjoy this the most as a fervent tactical turn-based gamer. If you like the combat in XCOM and Age of Wonders 3, you will find lots to love here.

Other plusses are the quick matchmaking, the active developers, the gorgeous pixel art and animations and the large amount of interesting lore.

I am personally not a fan of random stuff (which is why I stopped playing Hearthstone) and to me Duelyst strikes the perfect balance between randomness and tactics. Highly recommended! | Abosultely love this game! The strategy needed due to the infinite possibilities between the game board, placement of ""cards"", and of course the kick @$$ pixel graphics!!  A very satisfying game that could easily be played and enjoyed without spending a penny of ""real money"".  The daily quests (and free card) can get you enough gold to buy spirit orbs (card packs), gauntlet tickets (arena/draft play) and bloodborn orbs (card packs with cards you DONT have!).  Yes, if you get a crate you need a key to open it which costs $4.99.. BUT they did recently implement a ""common crate"" key reward for 15 quests completed in a month (easy).  However, if you are worried that you will be missing out on items due to not wanting to buy crates they are mostly filled with cosmetic items with 1 card here and there so they are not required to complete your card collection. The last thing I want to touch on, which is one of my favorites, is the fact that each ""faction"" or class does not only have 1 type of general that has the same hero power no matter the skin or avatar.  There are multiple general (main hero/""face"") options for each faction AND your general always has at least 2 attack and can  move around the board like a chess piece, the same as your minions, instead of just being your avatar with a set power that never moves or defends themself without a weapon equipped.

To get the FULL experience and really find out I suggest you JUST PLAY IT.  Nothing to lose since it is F2P, the system requirements are low, and if you want to get a free spirit orb (or just 100 gold) use my referral code ""gdaddanyt"" and friend me to play some matches!! :) | i like the art work and you can't complain about the gameplay really. sure there are some people with awesome cards or decks, but its all about the strategy. it makes you think and it doesnt get boring. if it does, you can always come back to it later and appreciate the workers who put effort into making this game awesome. | Please support Chinese

像素风刚刚开始还是有点难接受，毕竟看惯了3D画面，再改回来有点不习惯。不过深入去玩以后就会发现还是比较不错的，像素风也不是那么难以接受了。
相比于炉石，duelyst加入了战棋的要素，而且大大减少了随机性，让“有实力”的玩家可以真正靠自己的头脑走向胜利（炉石的导演实在是……），缺点就是上手比较难吧，我自己也摸索了好一阵才堪堪入门。

关于有一些大佬说的大规模封号的事件，应该说是大家都有错，但是官方确实没有一碗水端平。特别是在 [h1][i]传说之夜[/i][/h1] 那天，一群外国人滥用游戏机制封掉了一个大佬的号，这个举动寒了国内玩家心，所以才会有两篇4000小时的差评。现在快两年过去了，走了很多人也改了一些规则，游戏也慢慢地平静了下来，事情大概也能盖棺定论了。平心而论，这个游戏还是瑕不掩瑜，值得大家尝试，欢迎大家进群玩耍。

Якщо у цивці у фракцій є невеличкі відмінності які виражені парою юнітів і перками, то тут у однієї можна переміщати цілі міста, інша тераформує місцевість під себе, а дехто взагалі нормально почуває себе тільки у воді. Але є тут і недоліки які властиві більшості ігр цього жанру. А саме - якщо ти починаєш вириватись вперед по технологіям, містам і оснащенню військ, то перемога тобі забезпечена і навряд станеться щось що завадить виграти. Тобто, в середині гри ти вже починаєш розуміти що ця партія вже виграна, а до досягнення мети залишилось кроків п'ятдесят і ти просто додушуєш цю катку.
   Дуже раджу всим любителям цивілоподібних ігор. На перших порах будете воювати з інтерфейсом, але як звикаєш, то розумієш що він все таки зручний. І, як на мене, він зрозуміліший ніж в тій же цивці. | This is the Big One. The best, most imaginative, and fun strategy game of its kind. 

A psychedelic diamond. | A社 (Amplitude Studios) 的無盡系列策略遊戲，包括《ENDLESS Space》1跟2、《無盡帝國》，這些遊戲能用的派系不多，但每個派系都很有特色，使用不同派系時，策略必須大幅改變，在這方面比《文明帝國》系列有趣，《文明帝國》系列加上DLC後有很多派系，但不同派系的差異較小，而且有不少派系的特徵比較平淡無趣。
A社是規模不大的獨立開發商，為了節省成本，A社遊戲的聲光效果比不上大作，例如無盡系列的派系領導，畫面和語音較簡陋，但A社擅長設計感，用設計感彌補成本劣勢，遊戲中的各種美術設計都很好看，音樂與音效也不錯。
A社的策略遊戲，有很多要素都是模仿《文明帝國》系列，但A社也有各種創新，例如無盡系列，比《文明帝國6》更早採用""城市區域系統""，也比《文明7》更早採用：地形高低差、改良設施不用工人。A社《HUMANKIND》可途中切換不同派系，《文明帝國7》也有採用，結果《文明帝國》越來越像A社遊戲，有城市區域系統、地形高低差、改良設施不用工人、可途中切換不同派系。
幾年前A社預告《HUMANKIND》的時候，我原本希望它能沿用無盡傳統：派系比《文明帝國》少、但更有特色，可惜A社走相反路線，《HUMANKIND》派系非常多，但都較沒特色。
在國際上，無盡系列的平均評價比《HUMANKIND》高很多，許多A社粉絲對《HUMANKIND》感到失望....
最近A社正在開發《無盡帝國2》，希望它的派系能像一代那樣特別 | Endless games are very fun. Really enjoyed this over something like Civ, and the storylines are all so unique and engaging. The lore is intriguing and every race plays so dramatically differently from the others. | Сейчас уже мало кто об этом вспомнит, но ещё до выхода шестой цывы, эта игра изменила правила игры в жанре пошаговых глобальных стратегий, и именно от сюда фераксис позаимствовала, почти все, новые геймплейные фишки для новой цивилизации!

Очень любил эту игру до того,как разработчики испортили её.Раньше все старались построить хорошие машины,выбрать те оружия,которые им по душе.Были Тиры,и каждый Тир был сбалансирован,не было через чур(были,но немного) сильный противников.Было Древо улучшений.А сейчас - разнацветные кубики,пыль,кейсы,игроки строят коробки на одной ножке или коробки с ротором и цепляют на него самые имбалансные пушки,которые выпали из купленных кейсов.Подбор противников просто ужасен.Игру облегчили для максимума(чтобы любой идиот,у которого есть деньги мог играть в это и донатить как можно больше) и превратили в помойку.Раньше было намного лучше.Разработчикам важен только донат,а не сама игра. | Uwaga! Opis mechanik gry jest już przestarzały(wyjaśnienie na końcu);

Dobry przykład jak ze świetnej gry zrobić totalnego gniota bez balansu nastawionego na grind i mikrotranzakcje wymuszające kupno premium by mieć jakąkolwiek szansę normalnego rozwoju konta. Gra kilka lat temu była świetna, przyjemny rozwój robotów, przyjemne walki, gra była nastawiona na umiejętności budowy robotów, co było bardzo ważną umiejętnością, a walka polegała na starannym niszczeniu najsłabszych punktów przeciwnika. Było trochę problemów z balansem, ale twórcy kompletnie nie potrafili ich naprawić mimo tego, że gracze pisali wielokrotnie co trzeba zmienić.

Twórcy wszystkie problemy zaczęli ""rozwiązywać"" od najgorszej strony, tworząc przy okazji nowe problemy. Z czasem gra straciła jakikolwiek sens posiadania umiejętności budowy, ponieważ teraz często liczy się kto pierwszy zaatakuje, a nie skill. Tutaj już nawet nie trzeba budować, twórcy dali możliwość kupowania robotów innych graczy, przez co nie ma sensu się starać, lepiej kupić potężnego bota aktualnej mety, po co budować, skoro wszystko i tak będzie gorsze? Tu też przychodzi drugi problem, balans. Zawsze był z tym problem, lecz kiedyś nie aż tak duży. Jak zwykle twórcy nie potrafią rozwiązywać problemów, przez to w grze jest pewna tzw. ""meta"", czyli najskuteczniejsze boty w grze. Przez idotyczne decyzje twórców ta liczba w tej chwili wynosi bodajże 3(tak, 3 typy robotów są skutecznie na wyższym poziomie umiejętności, reszta to strata nerwów i przegrywanie). Mobilność bota jest wszystkim ponieważ nawet najtwardsze boty topnieją w chwilę, więc nie ma sensu budować niczego innego. Chcesz pobawić się tworząc ładnie wyglądającego bota? Zapomnij, chyba, że nie masz nic przeciwko przegrywaniu 3/4 gier. Twórcy nie potrafią rozwiązać jakichkolwiek problemów z balansem. Do tego doszedł system skrzynek, który polega po prostu na tym, że gigantycznie zmniejszył średnią zdobywaną kasę za bitwę oraz zachęca do kupowania premium w postaci ""patrz, super rzadki item, kup premium to go dostaniesz!"". Bitwa za bitwą a zbudować to, co przedtem mogliśmy po ~30 bitwach teraz musimy zagrać ich ~200. Chyba, że ma się farta i się wydropi legendarny przedmiot. Ewentualnie gra pokaże go w slocie premium i będzie chciała zachęcić do jego kupna. Recykling bezużytecznych itemów na kasę w grze daje idiotycznie małe wartosci, prawie nic, gracze domagali się podniesienia wartości recyklingu, po wielu miesiącach, twórcy w końcu zrobili to, ale tylko, kiedy ma się premium(!), powodując, że teraz premium nie tylko dwukrotnie zwiększa ilośc itemów ze skrzynek, to teraz trzykrotnie zwiększa wartość recyklingu każdego itema. p2w tego nie można do końca nazwać, ale definitywnie jest to PayWall. Aktualne premium powoduje, że otrzymamy tyle, ile przed updatem zanim zmniejszyli nagrody za bitwy. Grając za darmo otrzymujemy 6x mniej. Powodzenia zbudować bota z ulubionym wyposażeniem. Gra bez premium to katorga, W dodatku gra jest wieczną alfą, co służy tylko temu, by twórcy mogli sobie dowoli zmieniać so chcą, np. jeszcze bardziej zwiększając rolę mikropłatności w grze. W rzeczywistości gra jest w gorszym stanie niż 2,5 lat temu. Kilka miesięcy temu było baardzo źle i weterani uciekali od tego szajsu. Teraz jest jeszcze gorzej.

Podsumowując: Stuprocentowy negatyw.

@edit 24.05.2019 r.
Sporo się zmieniło, nie ma już lootboxów, powrócili (nieudolnie) do tierów oraz drzewka technologii. Gra jest nadal masakryczna. Fizyka skopana, najlepsze roboty to pojedyncza broń T5 na lekkim i szybkim(najlepiej latającym) bocie. ""Connecting To Server"" wszędzie, a w dodatku by zniwelować ubytek graczy nie można już wybrać trybu gry z rotacją co godzinę. Tak. Ta sama mapa, ten sam tryb, te same ustawienia PRZEZ GODZINĘ. Dodali ulepszanie broni(by zadawały jeszcze więcej DMG!), więc TTK jeszcze bardziej zmniejszyli(za czasów Overclockingu ludzie nienawidzili buffowania DMG, widać twórcy nic się nie nauczyli). Robopassy dające jakieś kiepskie kosmetyczne przedmioty by trochę kasy wyciągnąć z umierającej gry.
Od Grudnia 2018 r. stracili połowę istniejących graczy. Jak to zrobili? Pośrednio twórcy w końcu zobaczyli, że Robocraft z początków był lepszy, więc próbują wprowadzać rzeczy i mechanikę, która była w tamtym czasie. Problem jest taki, że po pierwsze robią to nieumiejętnie, po drugie, że nadal próbują swoje ""nowości"". Na końcu otrzymujemy dziadostwo, w które nie da się grać. W tą grę gra mniej ludzi niż w Spore. I pomyśleć, że Robocraft ze swoją unikalną receptą na grę posiadał ponad 7 tysięcy aktywnych graczy.

Jakiś czas temu wyszli z Early Access, a przynajmniej zrobili to teoretycznie, bo gra nadal się zmieniała drastycznie. W sumie gra jest w gorszym stanie niż w czasie wczesnego EA.

@Edit, 14.07.2019.
No i stało się. Robocraft upadł. Freejam zwalnia ludzi bo mają mało kasy, przyznali się, że Robocraft po opłaceniu serwerów wychodzi na minus. Wszystkie zasoby idą na RobocraftX(tworzenie gry od początku). Będą utrzymywać serwery tak długo jak to będzie możliwe i naprawiać większe bugi. Kilka lat ludzie pisali co jest źle z grą, mówili jakie błędy popełniają twórcy, wszystko dostali na tacy, twórcy mieli to gdzieś i dalej rozwalali grę po swoją tajemniczą ""wizję"", która się zmieniała co update dalej rozwalając grę dziwnymi rozwiązaniami, o które nikt nie prosił. To się nie mogło inaczej skończyć Radzę nie wydawać nawet grosza na tą grę, bo pieniądze mogą przepaść. | Encontre este juego hace unos años atras. Encontre un potencial exito indie multiplayer, como por ejemplo lo que hoydia es Rocket League.
Me enamore de sus mecanicas, y del desarrollo que Freejam de entregaba a su juego, sin duda yo me alegre bastante cuando Robocraft gano el Indie del Año por parte de IndieDB.

Era esos dias en donde era una Arena 10vs10, donde llegar a Tier 10 te hacia en uno de los mejores del juego. En donde tenias que ser consistente para ir desbloqueando todas las mejoras del arbol de tecnologias. En donde la sinergia del jugador y su maquina, y lo mas importante y lo que actualmente se perdio: completo trabajo en equipo. Y quien llevaba a nivel 100 era considerado un Dios.

Donde la habilidad era para saber construir el mejor vehiculo, en todos los ambitos posibles. En donde se copiaban diseños pero aun asi quedaban con un toque personal.

Esos dias. Antes de las torres. Antes de los Megabots. Antes de los medicos.
Cuando solo habian 3 clases. Y aun asi digo que la inclusion de los medicos dio un giro muy positivo al juego.

Donde TODOS. Iban en una fila por una de las 2 lineas principales del mapa. Y en donde se producia un 50/50 en donde podia quedar la absoluta mie*da en una batalla de 10vs10 frente a frente. Y en donde el equipo contrario llegaria a su base y el equipo de dividia para ir a defender la base.

Updates pasaban y no habia tanto cambio. Incluso la inclusion de las torres era una idea fantastica, y todo el mundo en los foros dio su apoyo. Pero simplemente y en mera opinion mia, no fue ejecutada de manera efectiva, o sonaba mejor en papel. Aun asi el juego era bastante bueno en esos momentos y todavia se apreciaba ese espiritu competitivo. Lo que realmente afecto al juego fue el sistema de respawn. Antes la gente hacia cosas imposibles para sobrevivir. O intentar capturar la base enemiga. Con el respawn vi morir frente a mi todo eso.

Hasta que 2 mecanicas nuevas mataron mi idea original del juego.
Las cajas y el nuevo sistema de ""dinero"".

Incluso yo estaba a favor de perder dinero por reparar el vehiculo cada vez que perdias. Y ahora hasta puedes comprar vehiculos prefabricados.
Seguramente si el juego hubiera ido por buen camino, ahora mismo estaría jugando competitivamente en un clan.

Pero lamentablemente soñar no cuesta nada. Intentar arreglar la dignidad de este juego, mucho.

EDIT:

Me han llegado comentarios que estoy tirando mie*da al juego solamente porque soy (""fui"") ""manco"". Los estoy borrando porque la verdad no demuestran nada objetivo.

Esas screenshots son para los ignorantes. Yo no andaba suelto con este juego, por eso que me apena que haya caido tan bajo.

This was one of my favorite games back in 2014. It had everything you could ask for: balancing, a good community, active and attentive devs, weapons that complemented each other, fun gameplay, good progression, lack of ""pay2win"" and so forth. Needless to say, it was awesome.

Then the January 2015 update was released.

The January 2015 update added a new gamemode where you destroy towers, levelled up, and respawn if destroyed. Initially, me and the rest of the community thought ""Cool."" and waited to see what else was in store. Little did I know that the downfall of Robocraft had begun.

(Order not completely accurate)

""Megabots"" (gigantic robots basically) were removed as soon as the update came out, if not before.

Crates were introduced (partially replacing the robits system), level based CPU limits eliminated, and the tech tree removed, eliminating progression, reducing creativity, and generally made the game much worse. Despite the huge outcry and the veterans and other players who started to leave the game, the devs simply ignored the community and moved on.

Helicopter blades were added, enabling people to make flying fortresses (maybe literrally). Personally I don't think much of this.

Then weapons, most notably an anti-air cannon and a minigun, were added, making weapons unbalanced and the game more frustrating to play. As a pilot in Robocraft (a more ""traditional"" one who used plasma bombers), this particulary saddened and angered me.

A robot shop was added, further reducing creativity.

An intro was added into the game, giving the game a more ""cheezy"" feel and making it seem as if the developers were copying other games. By this point, I personally felt that the developers were catering more toward children (12 year olds) and no longer valued older players and veterans.

All this time, veterans and other older players were leaving the game as it became increasingly apparent that the developers were not listening to the community. 

A new chat system was added, featuring a clan system that the community had been asking for for a long time. This was not nearly enough however, as the other changes above (as well as others) and the careless developers made the game unenjoyable for me (and potentially other older players, although I can not speak for them on this matter).

I finally left Robocraft for good in mid 2015 (shortly after the new chat system was introduced) after a brief stint operating a hovercraft with SMGs.

In it's current state, Robocraft is unbalanced and unenjoyable. The developers are careless and possibly largely inactive (aside from bugfixes and tweaks). Gameplay is frustrating, gamemodes horrible. 

As another reviewer (spynathan) has said: ""From Robocraft to Robocrap.""

If, somehow, all (and I mean all) changes to the game were reverted back to sometime before the January 2015 update, say, November 2014, me and other members of the community (read their reviews to see what they have to say) who have left Robocraft may very well return.

Until then, goodbye Robocraft. | 看我的游戏时间就知道了。这确实是一个好游戏，我还买了永久会员，但他现在确实让我失望了。我也是从T级时代走过来的人，RC的变化我也历历在目。不过现在，FJ的小霸王服务器，将游戏改的一塌糊涂，各种毒瘤载具对新手的压制，虽然出了简体中文，玩家也更多了，但为什么RC的评价在从好评如潮下滑到褒贬不一呢？我们应该思考，FJ更应该思考。"

Un jeu de stratégie spaciale assez complet, ou vous pouvez gérer une plateforme orbitale qui collecte des ressources sur des asteroides, crér des vaisseaux dans un chantier spacial, et lancer des recherches de technologies dans le labo.

Vous pouvez créer des vaisseaux personnalisés, vous choisissez entièrement les armes, bonus, moteurs que vous souhaitez y mettre (avec quelques restrictions de genre et de classes). C'est un grand plus puisque vous êtes libre d'expérimenter quasiment à l'infini, même si au final certaines 'formules gagnantes' sont repris par la majorité des joueurs.

Un autre point très positif c'est les systèmes de combats : 6 vaisseaux contre 6 vaisseaux, dans une durée limitée à 5 minutes. Vous pouvez utiliser des types de vaisseaux différents, croiseurs qui prennent des dégats, cuirassés qui dps un maximum, destroyer qui tire de loin, avec pour chacun des angles de tirs différents. Il y a de très nombreuses armes, bouclier, technologies disponibles ce qui fait de très nombreuses possibilités et une très grande liberté de jeu.

Passons maintenant aux sujets qui fâchent...

Alors ne cherchez pas un scenario, il tient sur un ticket de metro, et encore je suis gentil.

Les nouveaux joueurs peuvent être facilement et rapidement harcelés pour leurs ressources, ou pour faire des médailles en attaquant leurs bases. (voler les ressources d'autres joueurs n'est PAS une bonne idée)
Le système de jeu Pay2Win fait que les plus gros joueurs sont entre eux, dans les plus grosses alliances, et que énerver ne serais ce qu'un d'entre eux peut signer la ruine de votre entière alliance vu les différences de niveaux, et d'argent.

De plus, les dernières 'améliorations' de l'équipe de développement, provoquent un mur quasiment infranchissable entre ceux qui payent et les autres (quand je dis 'payer' je veux parler de 800€ par mois). Les différences ont toujours existées mais à plus ou moins 20% d'écart on va dire. Aujourd'hui il est de 1 pour 3, ce qui veut dire que si vous envoyez 1000 dps, vous tombez en face sur quelqu'un qui vous balancera 3000 (en ayant acheté tout ce qui va avec)

Un autre monde, ou finalement la CB remplace la qualité des joueurs, à un degré qui frise le ridicule. Je précise que l'équipe dirigeante de ce jeu n'a pas l'intention de changer du tout, bien au contraire, car dans les prochains mois ils sortent un vaisseau nouveau par mois. Ce qui veut dire qu'il faudra dépenser plusieurs centaines d'euros par mois, ne serais ce que pour rester à niveau (et je ne parle même pas des réparations sur les flottes, qui sont devenus obligatoires pour obtenir la moindre technologie valable).

Payer pour avoir la meilleure technologie, payer pour mettre ses ressources au max, payer pour réparer ses flottes, payer pour améliorer ses modules, nous faire payer, cracher au bassinnet, c'est tout ce qui intéresse l'actuelle équipe de ce jeu.

Le ridicule des bonus apportés aux gros payeurs, combiné à un rythme effrené des sorties de nouvelles technologies et vaisseaux (payez pour un vaisseau : il sera obsolète dans un mois), mène ce jeu, qui était assez exceptionnel, à sa ruine.

De nombreux joueurs vont quitter Vega Conflict, et vous l'aurez compris j'en fait partie. Un grand gachi ! | Great game ruined as a money grab.  This game has so much potential, but it falls short due to greed.  The game is beautifully rendered, fun to play, strategic and challenging, but not too difficult.  Unfortunately the negatives way out weigh the positives.  The negatives, and there are two only, are:  1.  this game is pay to win to the nth degree, and 2. there is a ton of down time waiting for ships to build or repair.  To put this into perspective, building a single mid-level ship would take 4 days to build, or you can do it instantly for $20.  Yes, build one ship for $20.  You have seven fleets of 6 ships each, for a total of 42 ships.  Let's do the math here.  If you want to pay to fill up your fleets with these mid-range ships it would cost you $840!!!  That is nuts!  Well, if you want to build them without paying it would take you 168 days!!!  This also leads to a ton of down time.   After you reach level 40+ (mid range), there isn't much to do other than grind.  Many of the events are above your level, and all of the quests are done.  So you can grind.  And wait.  And wait some more.  And wait even longer.

Look elsewhere for your fun, and to spend your money. | 玩了快一年半，实在是被KIXEYE（游戏开发商）气的不行了来写一篇评测。早期的VEGA还是很有意思的，大家的配置、策略变化很多，现在不断的更新，把老装备淘汰掉，整个游戏基本被个位数的武器统治。为了延长玩家的游戏时间把建造时间设的那么长，造个空船都要一两周，更别提mark I~V的升级了，掉率低的要死。不氪金虽然也能玩，但是想到小康的程度没有个一年每天1小时以上的投入根本不可能。即便氪了金不氪几千以上不会有明显区别，即便氪了几千金，KIXEYE一个更新，立马把你从中产阶级拉到贫下中农的水平，有时暗改参数也不通知，出了Bug找借口，各种设定不合理，就好像游戏开发者根本没有玩过自己开发的游戏一样。。
其实游戏本身素质还是不错的，只能说运营太差了。想玩的话在国内的最好用VPN，游戏里说英语和意大利语的居多，有几个国人联盟也不错。

The build time for high end ships are around 10 days per ship and repair times for damaged ships are outlandish as well. They don't even uphold there own rules. You will be harassed, bullied and kept from doing events by mega coiners. I had logged almost 2000 hours on this game and just deleted it. Don't waiste your time. | I enjoy the hell out of this game but I have got to the point where you have to spend money to get anywhere.

(It will disable achievements). It's still a fantastic cyberpunk CRPG with a XCOM like system, also comes with a lengthy post game DLC that is free. 

The game is also the most old Bioware in it's progression system and companion quests, while Dragonfall had the major elements, HK flesh them out a just enough to flesh out further. 

The true shining reason HK is the best is it's custom workshop campaigns. ""The Caldecott Caper"" and ""CalFree in Chains"" are two full sized games that use the same old Bioware like structure and are loosely connected with each other, all for no additional cost and are purely fan made. 

There is also Vox Populi, a custom campaign that back ported the first Shadowrun returns game in full plus companions and companion quests, again, for free. 

This entire trilogy goes on deep sale quite often, it's a no brainer to grab all of them when it happens, but HK is very likely the one you invest the most time in. | Best experience in the Shadowrun series and an exceptionally good crpg.

76561197992939661,291650,Pillars of Eternity,1.4166666666666667,RPG,0,"Pillars of Eternity is an outstanding throwback to the golden age of RPGs, successfully blending rich storytelling, intricate world-building, and deep character customization. From the very first moments, you're immersed in a beautifully crafted world full of history, intrigue, and lore that feels alive and vibrant. The developers at Obsidian have clearly poured their hearts into creating a game that doesn’t just tell a story, but invites you to shape it through meaningful choices and engaging dialogue.

The combat system is a perfect mix of strategy and real-time action, offering a tactical challenge that feels rewarding. The diverse range of abilities and character builds ensures that no two playthroughs are the same. There's also a level of depth in how you interact with the world—everything from your party's backstories to the lore of the land is fleshed out and the consequences of your actions reverberate throughout the entire game.

The narrative in Pillars of Eternity is a true highlight. The game handles themes of life, death, reincarnation and the nature of the soul with nuance and sophistication while presenting a world that feels lived-in and grounded. The overarching story is truly gripping with rich dialogues making each interaction feel impactful.

Graphically, the game uses a beautiful,  hand drawn isometric art style that makes the world feel both timeless and distinct, reminiscent of old classic RPGs like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape: Torment. The environments are detailed, and the use of lighting and atmosphere brings the world to a higher level. Its art direction more than compensates for any technical shortcomings.

Overall, Pillars of Eternity is a must-play for fans of old school cRPGs, or anyone who loves a good story paired with a deeply immersive world. With a vast, intricate world to explore, tactical combat to master, and an engaging narrative that constantly rewards exploration, it’s a game that stands the test of time and remains one of my favorite RPGs of the last decade. | Masterpiece unfortunately hidden behind a slow and uninteresting start. Top notch world, characters, and story, with a mostly good real time with pause combat system behind it. This feels like the real spiritual successor to the Baldur's Gate games, unlike the actual BG3 which is more akin to a Dragon Age Origins. I played this directly after BG1 and was actually shocked at how faithful Pillars feels to those games. I'm gonna give this five big booms on the boom meter. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! | The world that Obsidian built is great, the main quest, the side-quests, everything ties in very well and feels like a cohesive piece of art.

Where the game fails a bit is the game-play. During combat it's hard to track what is happening, and even though I completed a game, I never felt confident and as if I mastered the game's mechanics. Something that is usually a reward itself in crpgs.
The art-style left a bit confused, on one side, the game is beautiful, on the other it was so hard for me to discern characters from the background, or even one character from the other. In many encounters I couldn't figure out where each companion stands, and I had to rely only on their avatars.
Also, the story deliver and a bunch of text, lore and hard-to-remember names made the game much harder to enjoy.

Once it all settles down in your mind, you can enjoy it more. I almost feel bad that I played this game now after the resurgence of crpgs, because I feel time-pressure to play all those games (Pathfinder, Deadfire, D:OS). If I played this game when it came out, I'm sure I would've played it at much slower pace and gave myself more time to learn all the mechanics and read every sentence that was written.

Je ne sais comment c'est avec une manette, mais au clavier les déplacements sont désagréables. Ça gâche le jeu. J'aurai trouvé ça plus pratique de tourner le perso avec la souris, comme un hack'n slash de base quoi, ne serait-ce que pour mieux viser sans avoir à toujours verrouiller. Franchement, là je suis tout le temps obligé de verrouiller la cible pour viser correctement.

Je trouve que l'attaque au corps à corps est presque inutile et à utiliser seulement pour sa charge tellement les monstres se déplacent et attaquent vite. On n'a pas le temps d'attaquer au corps à corps, du coup je conseil de maxer l'attaque à distance + vitesse de déplacement et enfin la vie, tout en ayant toujours le max de potion à 5 avant de lancer un combat.

Les améliorations sont trop chers en âmes. Je ne sais pas si quelqu'un a réussi à tout upgrade jusqu'au combat du boss mais je n'ai réussi à qu'à up ""max"" le tir à distance, les autres étaient niveau 3. Il est dommage de ne pas pouvoir refaire des combats afin de collecter des âmes et up les stats, avant l'attaque contre le boss.

Je n'ai pas pu battre le boss, 3000 âmes c'est abusé et interminable. J'ai passé des heures et je ne suis pas descendu en dessous de 1400 / 3000. J'imagine que après les 3000 âmes, le combat contre le boss commence enfin mais ça je ne le saurais jamais. J'ai voulu faire une pause donc j'ai quitté le jeu et en revenant il n'y avait pas de sauvegarde... Ce serait vraiment sympa d'en ajouter une.

D'un côté je le recommande pour la difficulté et le défi mais de l'autre côté je ne le recommande pas à cause de la mauvaise maniabilité au clavier. Ce jeu demande d'avoir le temps d'y jouer jusqu'au bout, car il n'y a pas de sauvegarde."

Just a nice simple game. | A fun game that is easy to learn yet can be quite difficult at times. Once you start playing it continues to captivate you with its thematic artwork and excellent humour. A must try for all deckbuilding fans! | A fun game held back by some limitations in gameplay, some dungeons you just don't draw the map tiles needed to accomplish the goal in a reasonable amount of time. In others you get some powerful items offered and you just run away with the game.
There is some interesting gameplay in the simple style and very simple UI helps this. I didn't have any problems learning how to play the game. (initially I did when I had never played a card game before, and came back some years later to give it another shot and found it comically easy after playing several games now)

You'll lose a few adventurers just down to bad luck, sometimes you'll just get wrecked by being forced to fight an enemy  above their level. And sometimes you (or at least I) make mistakes, it happens but those mistakes can cost your adventurers their lives, something the game makes very clear to the player and it's not even meant to be a big deal, more adventurers will sign up very quickly.

So the interesting thing about this game is the maps are basically randomly generated from a set of tiles/enemies and loot. You build the dungeon, ideally towards a specific goal (kill the boss, collect X gold things and so on), unfortunately it's not quite as fun as it sounds. You'll sometimes get some very strong enemies you have to place, other times you'll get swamped with lots of low level opponents on the map and the dungeon will feel like a chore.
There's a little bit too much rng in what map cards are offered, and no way to edit or adjust the drawing of cards for that mechanic.

The actual combat is fairly quick and once you get to grips with the game. I'll say the first level or two of your adventurers seems to be when they're most vulnerable which is problematic because this is when the players are first using them, so most folk will never find out the stronger versions of your little gang of adventurers. (the traits can be powerful)
The biggest issue for me is that hp is just a bit too important, just a single point is enough to swing the outcome of some fights. 

You get to customise them but it's very basic, some hairstyle changes, rename them and a choice of 1 male or female voice. I started to get glazed eyes after customising my 8th or 9th adventurers, at some point the random visuals don't really matter, all that really matters at least to me was being able to complete the dungeons without losing the adventurers.

The level ups for the adventurers were a little limited, I think they mostly got +1 hp and after completing a dungeon they got a trait. I would have liked a bit of a skill tree to open up, rather than yet more rng.
The only real choice the player has in character customisation is what item they get to pick when they get the option in each dungeon.

The game is okay overall, it functions well (as it should, it's pretty simple in presentation). But eventually I saw through most of the mechanics over time and became a bit disappointed in how it wasn't simple enough to just let me have a fun time (adventurers die pretty easily), or complex enough for me to feel in control (lacking higher levels of customisation in various areas). 
Yet the game is fairly hard, particularly when you're first fighting a type of enemy for the first time in various types of dungeons. Once you get how to beat them it's no big deal, but until that point it's not a fun time.
It is however quick, each run is easily 30 minutes to complete or less so it's hard to feel to upset about it.

Honestly if I could offer on a sliding scale of review somewhere in the neutral region between positive and negative I would. (when I was having fun it was close to 8/10 experience, when I wasn't it was more like 3/10.  I don't know how to boil that down into one score)
You might enjoy what's on offer if you're really curious but for the most part new games do most of what this one does better and in more advanced and/or intuitive ways. 

Ever since slay the spire came out it's hard to argue anyone buy this game over something like that. Or even darkest dungeon. Or a whole host of other card games/rpgs if you want that kind of experience.

I respect this game for trying to tie together card games and dungeon delving but it just wasn't quite there for me. Not strong enough card mechanics to engage me on an intellectual level and not strong enough story/setting to get me immersed in the world/adventurers. Too hard to let me take it lightly and too comedic for me to take it seriously.

Anyways I'd still like to thank the devs for giving it a shot and working on the game for a good while after it came out. So many other devs just abandon projects if they're not immediate successes. | Oddly fun cheeky little game.

At first, the game bombards you with a ton of non-skippable events, missions, messages. While you trying to figure out what's going on, they put on a timer on you with this ""Project Avatar"" thing, and you immediately feel a lot of pressure. Some missions are just crazy difficult, like those for Serpent King and Mad AI factory, and you don't expect this difficulty this early in the game.
Mid-game you finally have a chance to catch some breath and start working on some research, building and engineering, but here's the catch: the moment you get better in the game, the moment you upgrade your weapons and armour, the enemies suddenly become more powerful and armoured. You just don't have a chance to enjoy powerful things that you've made, because they quickly become just what is expected by default.
The end game comes unexpectedly, with a lot of pressure on you. It consists of two consecutive missions with no pause in between. If you got some units damaged in the first mission, you either will have to replace your best units or send them in wounded. The final mission is crazy, the amount of extremely powerful enemies is over the top, and it carries a lot of stress.
Given that the game is flawed with bugs in controls, has dumb battle mechanics that lead to absurd situations and very challenging overall even on lower difficulties, I would not recommend this game. | XCOM2の面白さを語るには、前作にして名作 XCOM: Enemy Unknown (以下XCOM:EU) と比較すると分かりやすいと思う

まず前作のXCOM:EUからあらゆる面で順当に進化しておりボリュームも増した
Steamワークショップ対応でMODも充実と欠点なし！と、損は無いのでセール時にはぜひ買ってプレイしてほしい

以上を大前提とした上で、そう⋯700時間以上もプレイ（最高難易度を最小部隊人数でクリア済）した上で私個人の見解を言わせてもらうと
XCOM:EUよりもゲーム性（ゲームとしての楽しさの意）は落ちてしまったと感じる
XCOM:EUはXCOM2よりも飽きの来る要素が多いはずなのに⋯だ！
※EUでは敵の配置が一部完全固定だったり⋯etc

繰り返し遊ぶゲームとしてみるとXCOM2の方が優秀なはずである
ではなぜ私はXCOM:EUの方がゲーム性が高いと言えるのか？
XCOM:EUのゲーム性はまるでパワプロなのだ
パワプロもメインイベントは決まった日に起こるはずなのに、何度もプレイしても楽しい

XCOM:EUではストーリーの進行と、ミッションが適切な間隔で詰まっており
兵士の計画的な育成（＝ビルドを組む楽しさ）と、時間制限（＝敵の更新／強化）
のバランスがすごい良かったのだ
そしてランダム性が少ないことが→上手くなれば、あらゆる要素を縛っても戦術で勝てる
など良い方向に働いたりした

一方でXCOM2では、多くの追加要素により楽しさも増したが、
その分ストーリーとミッションの関連性が薄れ、またタイムリミット枠の選ばれし者たちの介入は、
戦闘を長引かせる良くない要素の一つだと思う
選ばれし者自体はすごく面白いのだが、3人は多い！ゲームのかさ増しになってしまってる

ストーリーとレジスタンスの尻拭いを交互にやらされるのも間延びする原因だ
XCOM:EUでは助ける国と、見捨てる国の切り分けも緊張感を煽る良いスパイスだった
XCOM:EUでの上手くなるは「ゲームオーバーにならなければ見捨てて/切り捨ててOK」だった
XCOM2では上手くなると「滅亡カウンターがやばくなってきたから、そろそろ助けに行くか～」と、どの難易度でもなった
侵略されてXCOM:EUより悲惨なはずなのに、なんか緊張感にかけるのである
追加要素をプレイさせるために、滅亡までの時間にどうしても猶予が出来てしまったためだ
この点がゲーム性がXCOM:EUより落ちてしまったと感じる部分だ

難易度が上がると、どんどん無駄を減らすプレイングが重要で、駆け抜けるようなゲームプレイ感になるXCOM:EUと
研究や勢力や選ばれし者など、たくさんの要素からどっしり構えて戦略を練っていくXCOM2とプレイ感が違う
そしてたまたまXCOM:EUの方が私に合っていただけなのかも知れない

돌창소리 듣기 싫은 당신에게 이게임을 추천합니다
대신 당신은 이제 씹덕이라는 소리를 듣게되겠죠 | Yes, it's a lot lilke Hearthstone, a game I enjoy immensely.

BUT ... the quality of life touches in Shadowverse just make this game so much nicer to play.

- Deck codes allow you to import an entire deck list instead of building it card by card.
- Replay mode lets you review your last 10 games.
- Story mode is more challenging and interesting than the Hearthstone tutorial.
- Daily rewards just for logging in.
- THREE quests every day.
- Rewards for reaching milestones in Ranked play.
- Special events with even more achievements and unique rewards.
- Prebuilt decks available for purchase, allowing you a 100 percent chance of getting certain cards.

HOWEVER ... I've now played enough of the game to see that the balance is very heavily skewed toward high-end-combo play. Most games between competitive decks are just a race to see who can get the big legendary combo off first, or to see if you can play your combo before the other guy draws the counter. All other turns are rendered trivial, so in a lot of cases it just boils down to a coin toss.

I'm not going to take back my positive review because I really do admire the foundation. And I recognize that other people do like this style of gameplay; it's just not for me. So while I'm going to uninstall it after saving this revised review, I still think it's worth a try for those who like CCGs. It's free, after all, and they are pretty generous with the cards, even though you'll never get enough free cards to be competitive. | [h1]I LOVE THE DEVELOPERS![/h1]

I wasn't even online and I got a bunch of packs for 'bearing with them' as they had to delay the Bahamut release. Not many card game companies are this generous. You get so many rewards for levelling the leaders, playing the campaign, and just playing the game. Even the daily quests all 'cooldown' faster after you earn them all.

The daring complexity, the fantastic mechanics, and the overall amazing style of the game manages to make a [b]very[/b] balanced and enjoyable card game to play. And there's not a whole lot of RNG everywhere (fuck you Fiery Bat) that just plagues the game for no reason. When RNG is present, it's tastefully done and a small chunk of RNG is good for card games.

Easily one of the best card games and I'm glad it's finally on Steam! Linking my account to my Steam account was super easy.

My only suggestion to the developers is possibly making a more fulfilling arena experience by allowing us to get higher than 5 wins. I feel as though that's one thing Hearthstone did really well. | Shadowverse es un CCG de estetica anime, con similitudes sobretodo con el conocido Hearthstone. 

Sin embargo, a nuestro juicio su sistema de juego y mecánicas estan algo más pulidas.

Shadowverse es un juego free to play, y es ciertamente generoso con el nuevo jugador, llegando a otorgarle alrededor de 30 o 40 sobres iniciales una vez completados los primeros pasos y la campaña introductoria a las bases del juego que tiene. Por supuesto se pueden comprar booster packs con dinero real, si el jugador considera oportuno adquirirlos. Además el juego tiene cross-play entre Steam y Android, por lo que puedes jugar directamente con jugadores de la otra plataforma sin ningún problema, además puede conservar y traspasar tu progreso de un dispositivo a otro, por ejemplo si juegas en steam, pero te vas de viaje, puede pasar tu progreso a una tablet y seguir jugando Shadowverse alla donde vayas.

Con el paso del tiempo, en expansiones de Hearthstone se ha ido fomentando el juego agresivo, con mazos enfocados unicamente en ir a la cara del enemigo sin preocuparse lo mas minimo por el control de mesa. Que es el fundamento principal de base de un juego de cartas, por las posibilidades que te da..

Pero antes de nada deberemos empezar por contar los fundamentos básicos del juego, una de las características mas notorias, y que llama la atencion a primera vista del jugador, es que en shadowverse existe la mecanica de evolucionar a tus esbirros (llamados followers en el juego). Cuando se inicia una partida, se determina quien sale primero o segundo, la diferencia entre una y otra es que el primero posee la ventaja del tempo en cuanto a puntos de mana y 2 puntos de evolucion *de serie* a su disposicion, mientras que el que sale segundo cuanta con la ventaja de tener un punto de evolución más para un total de tres, y una carta adicional al empezar la partida.
Evolucionar un follower, normalmente supone otorgarle un +2/+2 (ataque/salud) a un esbirro y además se le concede la habilidad rush, que quiere decir que puede atacar a otro follower en el mismo turno en el que es jugado. No confundir con cargar, que recibe el nombre de storm en el juego, que en este caso si puede atacar directamente al heroe enemigo, pero como decimos no son muchos los followers con esta caracteristica de storm. Pero además existen followers que activan habilidades extras al ser evolucionados, normalmente a costa de ganar solo +1/+1 o de no ganar ningun stat, estas habilidades pueden ser desde causar un daño en área, sanar a tu heroe, etc...

**Nota: Al decir de serie nos referimos al empezar la partida, ya que hay formas de ganar puntos de evolucíon adicionales, con followers determinados por ejemplo que tiene la habilidad de recargar los puntos de evolución total o parcialmente.**

Los desarrolladores Cygames, estan trabajado en como resolver el hecho sabido por los jugadores, de que el que sale segundo en la partida cuenta con una ligera ventaja, de forma que se esta estudiando la forma de igualar la balanza para que uno u otro tengan la mismas posibilidades en funcion del orden en el que salgan. Segun las estadísticas facilitadas en el último noticeboard, hablamos de que una diferencia de alrededor de un 5% en relacion de winrate segun se salga primero o segundo.

Añadir que existen actualmente y a fecha de este análisis 7 clases disponibles:
- Forestcraft: Cuya habilidad consta de combar cartas activando efectos una vez se juegan 2 o mas cartas por turno
- Runecraft: Cuya habilidad llamada spellboost hace que las cartas con estas características vean reforzado su efecto cada vez que se lanza un hechizo
- Swordcraft: Cuya habilidad trata de jerarquías de cartas en relacion a oficial y comandante, activando efectos adicionales al tener comandantes en juego.
- Dragoncraft: La cual tiene como característica el ""overflow"" que se producen efectos de cartas al tener 7 puntos de mana o más.
- BloodCraft: La cual activa su habilidad característica al tener el héroe 10 o menos de vida.
- Shadowcraft: EL cual tiene como habilidad el usas la necromancia, es decir cada vez que un esbirro aliado muere, se suma un punto a un contador, que puede ser usado para activar distintos efectos.
- Havencraft: Que tiene como habilidad las cartas de countdwon, generalmente amuletos que tienen un fuerte impacto pero que necesitan de varios turnos para activarse, aunque puede reducirse este tiempo con otras cartas.

El caso es que en Shadowverse, el daño directo al jugador rival desde la mano, es muy dificil, tiene un alto coste, o requiere de un elaborado combo para llegar a hacerlo.
Esto no quiere decir que no existan en Shadowverse mazos agresivos, ya que por supuesto que los hay, sobretodo en clases como BloodCraft o Swordcraft entre otros, pero mayormente en shadowverse lo que impera es el intercambio de cartas / followers.

Por último decir que el juego esta bastante bien equilibrado en su mayoría, cada clase tiene muchas posibilidades y varias cartas key para orientar el mazo a un estilo de juego o caracteristica u otra función, mazos de descartes, mazos de sanación, mazos de combo...
A nuestro parecer solo existe una única carta que esta OP, llamada Daria, Dimensional Witch, la cual ha otorgado una gran popularidad a la clase runecraft (alrededor de 1/3 de jugadores actualmente), pero que se le puede ganar si sabes como contrarrestar su efecto.

Asi que querido lector, si estas indeciso, desde aqui te recomendamos que lo pruebes, es un juego que engancha y divierte, y si vienes de juegos como hearthstone, el período de aprendizaje es muy muy corto.

**Nota: El juego esta disponible en inglés, no en castellano, al menos a fecha de este análisis, aunque es cierto que es un ingles muy muy básico y que aun sin dominar el idioma, cualquier jugador puede hacerse a los menus y textos muy facilmente.

Un saludo | 一応おすすめですが、無料だし一回くらい手を付けても良いのでは？程度です。

幼いころから学生時代にかけて、遊戯〇やなんとかマスターズなどをプレイしていた事がありましたが・・・。このゲームは「デッキを１から自分で考える」というカードゲームの醍醐味が失われているように感じました。

パクリだとか、バランスが悪いとかそれ以前の問題に思えるのは私だけでしょうか。いや、それも問題なんですけどね。バランスが完璧になっても、結局他人のデッキコピーすれば同じことですよね。言いたいのはそういう事です。

一番呆れたのはデッキコードを入力すれば他人のデッキがそのまま使えるという、思考停止機能。そりゃプロが考えたデッキをコピれば素人でもある程度強くなりますよね。デッキはカード一覧を眺めて１から作るのが楽しいもんだと思っていたため、価値観の違いに驚きました。

ランクマッチで上にいけばいくほど、同じようなデッキばかりで面白くありません。どのカードゲームでもドラゴン使いでしたので、本作でもドラゴンのみを使い、ストーリーをクリアした後ランクマッチを重ね、先日B1ランクまで到達しましたが・・・コピーデッキはもういいです。彼らに遭遇した場合、勝っても負けても同じ手でくるから面白くないし、でてくるカードが全く同じだと笑えてすらきますね。それなら昔のカードゲームのCOMプレイヤーと変わりませんよ・・・。

悪いところばかり書いてしまいましたが、フルボイスでカードのデザインが綺麗な点は戦闘を盛り上げていますし、一部のバランスブレイカーを除けばなかなか遊べると思いますよ。ストーリーだけプレイして、コンピューター対戦の超級を制覇するだけでも無料にしては十分遊べるかと。フレンドとプレイも出来ますし。工夫があれば十分遊べるゲームだと思います。

例えば、使用禁止カードをお互い決めてデッキを組み、対戦するのも楽しいですよ。

カードゲームとして純粋に楽しみたいなら、カードの種類だけ情報を集め１からデッキ構築するか、２Pickがお勧めです。最初は負けていても、改良を重ねて勝利数が増えてくると嬉しいものです。人によってはデッキに愛着がわくかもしれません。

光る部分は十分あるゲームですので、今後改善を少しだけ期待しています。"

As of the time of the review, here's a number of issues which need to be addressed by the game
[olist]
[*] Game will randomly hang when attempting to start a new practice game. Other players have reported this also occurs when attempting to start a normal game.
[*] The way the AI plays cards is unfair due to the simultaneous play mechanic; the AI has a tendency to play wait several moments into a turn's main phase, then play all their cards at once, making it very difficult for human players to read and respond to any individual action taken by the AI, which also causes problems because of the short timer.
[*] The Initiative system determines who attacks first during combat, and is governed by who played a card or activated an ability last; unfortunately, this does not work well with the way AI plays its cards all at once, because the player either plays all their cards early and end up being unable to respond to anything the AI does in order to keep initiative, or the player waits for the player waits for the AI to play all their cards and loses initiative every time.
[*] Individuals have to decide which enemy to block before attackers are known, another problem of the simultaneous turn system.
[*] Draft system costs a investment of in-game currency or real money, but (A) it's dead and you can't play against AI, and (B) you don't keep the cards you draft.
[/olist]

Basically, you could say a huge problem of the game is its conceit that a simultaneous turn system is a good thing, when, as implemented, it's a huge hindrance. Ultimately, the central conceit of the game is either poorly implemented, or just a bad idea in the first place. | Excellent rts game. All the fun of MtG with about 1/4 the play time.

Having played Civ 7 for a few hours now, I can say that that those of us who truly loved and still love Civ 5 judged Civ 6 too harshly when it released. It changed some things that people liked, but I still found many of its new features truly enjoyable on launch. I had fun. I still preferred 5, but in 6 the art, the music, the innovations to unrest, espionage, religion, and--to a lesser extent--city development were all excellent. Heroes are cool. The roster is cool. Civ 7 has little that is as redeeming in it at launch and I wholeheartedly recommend 6 instead. | Great game and recommended if you are a strategy player. Looking forward to the new game soon! | Гра чудова, подобається різноманіття можливих стратегій розвитку цивілізацій. 

З негативного на мій погляд - викривлення певних історичних контекстів. Простежується культурна апропріація. 
Як наприклад Києво-Печерська Лавра - серце України в реальності,  є особливою спорудою російської імперії у грі... Як зокрема і унікальний юніт - козаки, що у реальності початково виникли як соціальний клас саме у степах України.
 Дуже нериємно це бачити, особливо в умовах, коли росія щодня знищує наші міста в реальності...

 | Нові стратегічні рішення та чудова графіка.
Але важко уявити, що в 2025 році ми все ще змушені бачити у світі ігор проросійські наративи. У новій версії гри розробники ""відзначилися"" черговим ігноруванням української локалізації та повного ігнорування української нації, яка переживає героїчну боротьбу за своє існування та незалежність.  

Анонс нового персонажа, цариці-душогубки, яка нав'язується як ""символ культури та просвітництва"", виглядає як зневага до мільйонів українців. Героізація імперіалістичної постаті — це не тільки обурливо, але й аморально в контексті війни та окупації, яку сьогодні переживає наша країна.  

Українці заслуговують на повагу в індустрії відеоігор, а не на спроби просувати імперський наратив під виглядом ""культурних цінностей"". Досить толерувати пропаганду! Вимагаємо повноцінної української локалізації, українських героїв і персонажів, які реально відображають нашу історію, культуру та боротьбу.

It's hard to believe that in 2025 we are still witnessing pro-Russian narratives in the gaming industry. In the latest version of the game, the developers once again ignored Ukrainian localization and completely erased the Ukrainian nation, which is heroically fighting for its survival and independence.  

The announcement of a new character, a tsarina-murderer being portrayed as a ""symbol of culture and enlightenment,"" is a slap in the face to millions of Ukrainians. Glorifying an imperialist figure is not only outrageous but also immoral in the context of the war and occupation Ukraine is enduring today.  

Ukrainians deserve respect in the gaming industry, not an attempt to promote imperial narratives disguised as ""cultural values."" Enough with the propaganda! We demand full Ukrainian localization, Ukrainian heroes, and characters that truly reflect our history, culture, and struggle. | 非常杀时间的游戏，经常一开始玩就忘记时间了，看着文明不停地发展，心里也会有种成就感，只是这个画风有点卡通了，要是能够写实点就好了😁😁😁"

Но это как с перцем, который жжётся дважды. Или яхтой из Рок-н-ролла.

Плюс это порт мобильный донатной игры. | Faeria is fun. Okay, I can see myself spending 10 more hours on fighting AI on Pandora Mode. I already spent 28 hours. The rest of the game depends if I can push myself over the skill cliff of deckbuilding, because it's really hard. I can recommend this game very easily. I get to max out the utility of every monster, every decision, and win a lot.

But let's go into the reasons why this game isn't successful. NOTE: I go against AI and don't really compete.
- Faeria looks like a typo to a lot of search engines. It's very close to Fairy.
- You don't get to walk around. Like every other trading card game, you battle and these battles can get lengthy. There's no rest stop besides staring at the card collection.
- The campaign mode is fighting random NPCs with one-liners and that's it. There's no story, no satisfying closures besides winning, no secrets to unlock beyond the loot boxes of cards. The boss battles do have that unfair advantage, but there's no extra flair to them so they still look like normal NPCs to fight. While you are building a card collection, most people won't feel the dopamine of progress.
- In a fair match, the tension is not there for a lot of mid games. You either steamroll or get steamrolled. This might be because I play very defensively and haven't touched the aggressive cards. This might also be b/c I don't play competitively. I like steamrolling, but variety is the spice of life.
- Most of us will never ever beat this game, because the hard challenges are really hard. Many games can split the difficulty into Easy Mode, Normal Mode, and Hard Mode. This game doesn't split those modes, it blends them all together (easy stuff first ofc) and you know, not everyone wants to play Hard Mode. Like I said, my next 10 hours are probably going to be Pandora Mode and ignore the rest of it.
- I've fallen into playing very defensively. Like I ALWAYS go for the faeria well on the first turn. This might be a me problem, but I feel like it's the strongest strat.

What is Pandora Mode? You build a random deck 1 card at a time and play 6 random NPCs in a FAIR match. And there's rewards for it.

But again, I like the game. But again, I like utilizing every card to the most of its ability, being very goal-orientated when I place new land, and then steamrolling my AI opponents."
76561197992939661,531640,Eternal Card Game,2.2666666666666666,"Casual, Massively Multiplayer, Strategy, Free To Play",1,"I've played Magic on and off my whole life and spent at least 1000 hours playing Hearthstone. I had MTGO since the very beginning, and Hearthstone since late 2013 near the end of the open beta. Eternal is the best online card game I've ever played. It combines the best aspects of Magic's strategic depth and Hearthstone's fast-paced accessibility while avoiding their flaws.
F2P
Magic will always be expensive because it's a tradable CCG with a reserve list of cards that can't be reprinted and expensive booster packs. Most cards lose tons of value when they rotate out of standard. MTGO is less expensive and more liquid than physical cards, but still expensive. Recently, Wizards have added features similar to other digital CCGs like treasure chests.
Hearthstone is ""F2P"" in name only. New players need to spend lots of money or time to earn a viable deck. Otherwise, enjoy scraping out wins with a crappy pile at rank 17. Rewards for winning games are meager. You can get big payoffs in Arena (where you don't get to keep the cards you draft)...if you're already an experienced player and/or lucky. Arena costs 1.5 packs to play with cards you don't own and win at least 1 pack of value. You don't keep the cards. New Arena players get trashed.
Eternal is truly F2P. The spoils of victory are frequent and generous. Each win either gives a treasure chest with gold and a card, or more gold and a better card, or even more gold holy shit and a booster pack. Each treasure chest has a chance of becoming a better treasure chest full of even better rewards. Single-player Gauntlet mode lets you face the AI for free to win big rewards. Forge and Draft are more expensive than HS Arena (2.5 and 5x pack price vs. 1.5x pack price), but you get to keep all the cards you draft in Forge and Draft modes while still winning big payoffs for playing well.
Magic is pay to play, try to recoup your losses later. Hearthstone is an evil slot machine that reluctantly hands out the goods. Eternal is a slot machine that always gives you something, but sometimes gives you something better, and occasionally gives you an all-expenses-paid trip to Hawaii.
Winner: Eternal
Gameplay and RNG
Magic is the deepest, most complicated, most strategically interesting CCG ever. Almost every type of card, zone and resource can be interacted with, during both players' turns. The mana system rewards intelligent deck building and decision making skills. However, the mana system has also been a constant thorn in its side. Mana screw and flood as well as color screw are a necessary evil of the game's design, and consistently ruin the experience and decide high-level matches. The mulligan system punishes you further for the crime of being unlucky. Magic Online makes no use of any digital-only design space (except Momir Basic) and the relief from shuffling physical cards. The metagame gets patched several times a year whenever the physical Banned and Restricted list is updated.
Hearthstone sidesteps resource problems with its mana system, but has different issues instead. It's a simplistic ""My turn, your turn"" game with a hard limit to how interesting and interactive it can be. The mana system means that instead of getting mana-screwed, you get tempo-screwed if you don't draw a 2 on turn 2, a 3 on turn 3, and so on. It's called Curvestone for a reason. Being able to attack anything directly means that losing the board first usually means losing the game. The mulligan system is good. Hearthstone explores digital design space, but leans overwhelmingly on random effects. The RNG is so hilariously pervasive that even top-level players meme about it on a constant basis. Omnipresent powerful random effects make situations that are impossible to play around. It's one thing to get outplayed, but it feels awful to get outlucked. HS is the game of getting outlucked. Also, the meta is prone to getting extremely stale as Team 5 moves very slowly to nerf problem cards and very rarely buffs weaker ones.
Eternal simplifies the essence of Magic's strategic, interactive gameplay. You can still interact on your opponents' turns and there's plenty of powerful spot and mass removal (at common and uncommon, even!) to deal with tall and wide boards. The mana and combat systems are similar to Magic's. Eternal mitigates bad opening hands by allowing you to redraw a 7 card hand with between 2-5 mana cards, guaranteed. Flood and screw are still possible, but not nearly as frequently as in Magic. The combat system is much more interesting less blatantly aggressive than Hearthstone's, with different advantages given for attackers and defenders. Eternal makes excellent use of digital design space. You can affect cards in any zone, some cards make copies of themselves when drawn, and card attributes will persist across different zones, resulting in creative combos. As far as the metagame, in the last few months Dire Wolf Digital has shown a willingness to alter cards and tune up the meta in a timely manner when certain strategies are revealed to be too oppressive or lacking in counterplay.
Winner: Magic for overall depth, Eternal for elegance and creativity with digital space.
Polish and Features
Magic Online is the laughingstock of the digital games world. However, it has many more features than HS, with a huge variety of formats available, a full-featured collection and deck manager, and the ability to trade tickets cards with bots other players.
Hearthstone is a beautiful experience with compelling graphics, music, animations and voice acting. However, it possesses a few game modes (casual, ranked, arena, tavern brawl) with only two formats for now (wild and tavern brawl). It possesses extremely few features despite its obscene profitability and years post-release. There is no tournament mode and the deck and collection managers are very weak.
Eternal's art direction, sound design and graphical effects are better than Magic Online (like every other game) and worse than Hearthstone's (like every other game), but far closer to Hearthstone than to Magic Online. It only has two single player and two multiplayer modes. It has an intuitive, full-featured collection manager and deckbuilder with analytic tools to help guide deckbuilding.
Winner: Hearthstone for polish, Eternal for features.
Verdict
On the whole, Eternal refines and simplifies Magic's gameplay and creatively explores new design space while avoiding the egregious errors of Hearthstone. The gameplay finely balances a majority focus on skill with a pinch of luck. There is a wealth of interactions and strategies to explore. The online experience is elegant, enjoyable and full-featured. The game is generous with its rewards. You should stop reading this and install it right now. Why are you still reading this? Go away. Go play Eternal | Quick Review: Great Magic: The Gathering inspired digital CCG. Amazing UI, loads of features, brilliant draft system, and some truly awesome cards. But... as an MTG derivative, you have to be able to accept mana flooding/screwing.

Long Review:

I wanted to put some good hours into the game before reviewing (18 as of this post). I've completed the Tutorial Quests, four Forges, one draft and a ton of ranked games. Oh, and I've been playing Magic since Arabian Nights and Hearthstone since Beta.

To start, this is NOT Hearthstone. It is Magic the Gathering. Everything you know from Hearthstone doesn't apply here. You have to play ""power"" cards (mana/lands), so you need to know how to balance a deck. The system will try to do it for you and they start you out with a full set of 40 ""dual stones"", but to be good at the game you'll need to understand how to get the proper ratios. You also don't choose how you attack. You choose WHO attacks, and the opponent chooses blocks.

Once you accept that this is Magic on digitial steroids, you can really enjoy the game. Note: the initial tutorial quests are drudgery. Your decks suck and the mana ratios aren't great. They should really let you skip parts of this, but they don't. JUST PLAY THROUGH. It's worth it. You'll get a free Forge, which will net you a solid amount of packs and get you going.

The UI is AMAZING. You can get through games in 5 minutes and there is almost no waiting. Everything just works like you expect it to. WotC should hang its head in shame after seeing this.

There are a ton of cards for a first launch and lots of interesting deck ideas to build around. You could say that there are some balance issues - Black has a ridiculous suite of creature removal for a core set - but overall it does feel like every color have something truly special that it can do, and there are solid Aggro, Control and Combo strategies.

While I still love Hearthstone, I've been finding myself coming back to Eternal again and again, excited to play more. It's awesome and will be enjoyed by anyone who has played and enjoyed Magic at any time in their life. | Surement l'un des meilleurs, si ce n'est le meilleur jeu de cartes actuellement disponible sur le marché.

Il combine à lui seul tous les avantages qui sont présents sur ses concurrents directs. 

Ici il a très peu de places au RNG (comprenez à la chance), bien sûr il y en aura toujours sur ce type de jeu puisque cela reste un tirage sur plusieurs dizaines de cartes et si une carte tombe au bon moment dans une partie qui semble perdue cela peu la renversée.

Aspect également important, c'est que c'est un vrai free to play. On peut vite obtenir des cartes du seul Set disponible à l'heure actuelle. Tu farmes, tu suis les quêtes journalières, tu seras récompensé. Pour ceux qui détestent l'aspect versus contre d'autres joueurs, il existe des modes exclusifs contre l'IA (vous contre l'ordi en somme). C'est très intéressant pour des joueurs débutants qui veulent prendre leur temps sur chacun de leurs tours. Ici pas de chronomètre si vous mettez trop de temps a joué pour vous mettre la pression !

Seul point qui peut rebuter les joueurs non anglophones, le jeu n'est pas traduit en français a l'heure actuelle, mais rien de dramatique en cherchant un peu avec google tu vas pouvoir t'en sortir petit geek ! | + A interface é muito boa e intuitiva (cópia descarada do hearthstone);
- Uns diriam que o jogo é pay-to-win, mas quando na verdade é um pay-to-play como acontece em TODO cardgame da categoria, você não ganha por pagar mais, você paga para ter as cartas e ganha se souber jogar;
+ O jogo possibilita grindar as cartas muito facilmente, você ganha gold rápido além de ganhar cartas a cada vitória;
+ Os boosters vem com 12 cartas sendo uma delas rara/lendária, sendo assim você consegue fechar um playset de cartas de raridade mais baixa muito rápido, tendo que se preocupar apenas com as 'caras';
+ Existem MUITAS mecânicas e interações baseadas em magic, tornando o jogo muito mais competitivo e menos randômico (bom pra quem odeia o RNG do hearthstone);
+ Existem cartas chamadas 'fast spells' que são o equivalente das 'mágicas instantâneas' do magic, estas cartas possibilitam jogadas de resposta durante o turno do oponente;
+ Durante o combate, os jogadores escolhem apenas se atacam e com quais criaturas eles atacam, o jogador defensor escolhe se bloqueia e com quais criaturas ele bloqueia (semelhante ao mágic, diferente do hearthstone), ao meu ver isso possibilita a presença de mais criaturas de utilidade no deck (que possuem algum tipo de efeito que não seja apenas voltado ao combate) e meio que exige cartas de resposta do oponente para tais criaturas (removals), além disso as criaturas 'regeneram' o dano no final de cada turno, assim como acontece no magic;
+ O tutorial inicial do jogo é muito bom (não é nem um pouco chato) e te mostra boa parte das mecânicas além de te presentear com boas cartas, no final do tutorial você já ganha um deck de uma facção (cada deck já vem com uma lendária e o deck da facção das sombras tem uma lendária muito boa);

Só jogando pra ver mesmo, tanto para os jogadores de magic, quanto para os jogadores de hearthstone fica a dica deste jogo ;) | Jedna z większych niespodzianek wśród rosnącego ostatnio bardzo rynku karcianek. Spodziewałem się kolejnej karcianki a'la Hearthstone a tu taka niespodzianka! Dla mnie HS odpychał zbyt bardzo casualem, tutaj mamy już głebie zaczerpniętą z MtG. Tak dobrze słyszycie ta gra to wyśmienite połączenie Hearthstone z królem karcianek jakim jest Magic the Gathering. Oprócz standardowych trybów znanych z konkurencyjnych tytułów błyszczy szczególnie dobrze zanany fanom MTG tryb Draft. Najlepsze w tym trybie jak i trybie Forge(odpowiednik HS'owego ""drafta"") jest to, że karty które wybieramy dostajemy na zawsze!!! Inne plusy to duża ilość kart, możliwość tworzenia decków o dużej synergii na wzór też tych znanych nam z MTG, nie mamy wrażenia składania po prostu mocnych kart w jedną talie jak w HS. Gra mimo fazy wczesnego dostępu ma bardzo dużo contentu i jest ciągle rozwijana. Dodatkowo duża liczba graczy jaki, prężnie rozwijające się community tej gry powoduje, że wieszcze jej świetlaną przyszłość. Dajcie tej grze szanse a nie pożałujecie !!!"

[b]10 детских паровозиков из 10.[/b] | We love the board game version of this game. This had a very similar game play and was a lot of fun. We set it up for the kids after they were done with school to pass the time during COVID19. | Ticket to Ride: First Journey is a good first introduction into the Ticket to Ride games. It is pretty simple and leaves out some of the more complicated rules of the original game.
All your actions, except for building trains, are random. The objectives you get are random and the cards you draw are also random. It means that there is a lot less strategizing with which objectives you want or how you want to draw your cards, you get what you get and have to think around that.

There are some things that I personally did not like, but others could. Some of the animations feels too long. When you complete an objective, you get shown all the cities that you went through, and that is a slow animation even when animations are set to fast. Another thing that I do not particularly like are when you get showed a completed objective is that every city has a unique sound to it, and some of those sounds are longer and more annoying than others. For example, Riga, in the Europe map, has a cat sound, and that sound is both long and annoying.

I believe that, aside from the few things that I found a bit annoying, this is a great first introduction to Ticket to Ride. If you want to get this to play together with a child, or if you want an easier version of the original game to play, then this is the game to get. I think you can have a pretty good time with it. | UPDATE 20181222: In the Steam discussions is a solution to this issue which worked perfectly.

The artwork that goes into making the characters is beautiful. You can even watch the guy draw on twitch, and I recommend you do, give him some views! 

It also has lore, and fun banter between the characters to read between levels. 
My favourite is Jarlaxle. 

But the games monetization is very egregious. Over 200 quids ""worth"" of DLC and an in game store with loot boxes. 
You can get these in game, which is at least a plus, but it feels like an advertisement, the way they are drip fed to you.
And when I say worth, there's a pack in the game, that comes with an autoclicking raccoon (Trash Panda) and some potions, it says it's 35 quids worth at the cost of 15 quid.
That is not 35 quids worth. Some potions and an admittedly very cute, Raccoon are not worth 35 quid... If you think that, then you're just incorrect. Factually false.

If you're content to leave the game on in the background, that's not a problem. You'll eventually get things that will be left in the background. There's also codes you can enter for free chests, which is nice. A point in the games favour.

But I cannot recommend this game, on the basis that it is so greedy. So many micro-transactions. You can potentially spend hundreds of pounds on a game that you leave on in the background. 

If you are not the kind to fall prey to microtransactions, then yes, by all means, get this game, leave it on in the background, and enjoy. But if you are... then avoid it at all costs! Because this game will ride you hard and take you for everything you've got. | Un univers qu'on apprécie

And I... sailed the seas. Its not something I'm ashamed of, and if you are down on your luck, still a kid, or just don't feel like jockeying the Steam refund policy to see if you like a game, most game devs would prefer thats how you play their game over buying a copy of dubious origin from a reseller. 

Why even bring this up, you might ask? Well, it was only last year that I realized how much had gone into the game, and that there was a 4th character that I had no clue even existed. And, against my better judgement with regards to my ever disappearing free time, I picked up STS again to try that 4th character. And then I started playing the other characters too. And then I started ascension runs. 

Never in all my days have I encountered such a well crafted deckbuilder. Being singleplayer, STS doesn't care if you find a combo that breaks the game and makes the enemy unable to interact with you. Slay the Spire doesn't try and limit your ceiling, it dares you to go infinite, it [i] wants [/i] you to go infinite. My favorite part of the game is how it encourages offense while putting more than enough wrinkles in your path that you can't just go full zerg rush. Fully indexing into any one thing without accounting for the counters puts you on the path to losing. 

Learning the Watcher, the illusive 4th character I didn't know existed as it got added after I put my 500 [strike] pirated [/strike] pre-purchase hours in has been one of the most enjoyable deckbuilding experiences I've had since... well since I played STS the first time. 

The main thing I was trying to do on the Watcher that was so fun was going infinite. There was a really interesting play pattern you can take where you reset a lot and chop your deck down to like 3 powers and then your 2 card combo that goes until you win. The fun part is that by taking your deck down to so few cards, any enemy that adds cards to your deck in any way is immediately the most threatening thing you could encounter. You also have to make illogical decisions in order to get to infinite. You skip like 90% of cards you are offered, you make sacrifices for some things that would never make sense in a normal run. And that is just ONE way to play the game on one character, completely ignoring everything that comes with ascension runs. 

And all of that is also completely ignoring everything that isn't purely gameplay. The art is amazing, the soundtrack is amazing, the sound DESIGN is amazing, and there has never been a better time to get into Slay the Spire because there is a sequel that looks like its amping up everything about the first game and giving more of what is undeniably one of the grandpappys of indie roguelikes. That would've been a silly statement 10 years ago, but there are so many indie roguelikes now that it can be hard to stand out among them. 

Slay the Spire has stood the test of time and remains at the top of the tower. Play this game, and if you can, uh, pay for it while you're at it... I did. Eventually.

---致我人生第一次玩的卡牌肉鸽神作《杀戮尖塔》
前几日冬促，购买了《杀戮尖塔》这款游戏，在玩之前心里曾想：我玩过那么多个3A大作，怎能会被一个小小的卡牌游戏震撼呢？看着steam好评如潮的评价，心里抱着不理解和尝试的态度，还是打开了游戏。

没错，我摊牌了，我彻底被这个游戏折服，从买完游戏到现在我无时不刻都在玩，目前也差不多一百小时了，如此优秀的游戏玩法和质量已经能超越很多3A大作。

再玩之前，我也确实久仰杀戮尖塔在卡牌肉鸽当中的地位，但是我也确实从来没玩过卡牌肉鸽，《杀戮尖塔》也属于我在肉鸽类游戏中的白月光了吧。确实只有在实际上手之后才能感受到其中的魅力。从最开始的重开在商店里找好遗物，到现在稍微有些对删牌过卡的理解，这种不完全依赖随机而是能够在游戏局内运营、构筑卡牌的机制正是它的魅力所在。同时四个角色特色迥异，相同角色又因为不同的牌组构筑有着不同的打法，再加上几乎毫无门槛的操作，在roguelike游戏的重开-学习的过程中，低挫败感、高成就感、对卡牌的熟悉以及逐渐对角色的理解使得游戏过程不像通常的卡牌roguelike，而更加有趣，能取舍是否该拿牌、是否该移除卡牌、接下来又该怎么构筑，这使该游戏的可重复游玩性大大增加。


前些天终于用战士，猎人和鸡煲把心脏打通关了，也算是对这游戏有些浅薄的理解了

开始玩这游戏的时候，好哥们建议我先玩鸡煲，说是鸡煲转起来特别强，而我也感受到了。

后来哥们和我说，玩战士得学会烧牌，我很诧异，明明每张牌都是我精挑细选的，为什么要把他们烧掉呢？后面理解了，把效率低的卡烧掉后，留下单卡效率最高的卡，打怪效率更高。之后喜欢上了烧牌的感觉，尤其很喜欢腐化，当把其他牌烧干净后，只剩下那几张攻击牌，颇有种破釜沉舟的感觉，就算打不过再sl嘛，把不该烧的牌留下来。

当我研究战士烧牌的时候，我认为战士是一个最需要想象力的职业，玩的时候得靠想象力。

关于杀戮尖塔的赞美太多太多了，我不想去赞美游戏的本身。我印象最深刻的一局是战士第一次打败心脏，因为卡组不太好，强度不高。我腐化黑拥SL一个小时二十次，结局依旧是输。我相信我能赢，我把29张牌牌序列出来，腐化黑拥烧完不同的牌牌序列出来，一个小时后我终于找到了那个解，最后我赢了之后长舒一口气。在那一刻我赢了游戏，在那一刻也赢了时间。或许一个小时我重开一局选牌好早赢了，可是能赢的局我不愿认输。


即使最后我们都会输给时间，这没关系，那也要谱写出每个人自己生命的赞歌。什么是生命的赞歌？或许是藏在人们骨子里的永不屈服、永不妥协、永不认输。

我的人生没办法sl，为了战胜这一路上的小怪，烧过那么多休息牌，娱乐牌，还换了那么多血，这是否真的值得？可惜这个问题的答案没法通过sl去知道了。
现在的我，就想赶快走到下一个篝火休息。人生啊，总是奔向下一个篝火，区别是以前的我会在篝火敲牌，以后我只会休息了。

最后感谢《杀戮尖塔》给我带来一百小时的快乐时光，我现在唯一后悔的就是在大学期末考试期间购买了这款游戏，这游戏真的有瘾啊！😭 | 又开始带鸡煲节奏了我真是服了😅鸡煲是这个游戏唯一的完美职业，已经和尖塔融为一体，成了尖塔的底层逻辑，成名绝技偏差认知给尖塔带来了这个贴吧最经典的话题，创造了尖塔的黄金时代，诋毁鸡煲，你想毁了杀戮尖塔吗？
 | Dangerous dangerous game, whether you are playing it on the go via tablet or have it on steam maybe with mods as well, if this is the right game for you your free time will evaporate. If you like deckbuilding, pve strategy and the like, this is just perfect. If you've got a background in competitive/multiplayer collectable card games, the pve nature of slay the spire enabling you to do some truly unbalanced things will make you ecstatic

If you're thinking of ""why bother getting this game when Slay the Spire 2 is going to come out soon?"", well this is already one of the best games of all time, don't be silly. | 仅仅是打了个全成就 ，仍然无法全面的评价这个游戏。因为这100个小时里仅仅专精了猎人，还有三个职业只是简单玩了玩。
真的有点惊叹于游戏的设计，仅仅四个角色，仅仅三个区域（算上心脏四个）却可以让一个游戏有着如此大的可玩性。看似重复的遭遇和地图，随着局内带来的各种惊喜（多种多样的道具，卡组搭配，药水选择，随机事件等）和精妙的设计（数值的平衡和关卡的平衡）可以说再玩几百个小时都不会觉得腻。而且这还是我没去更深体验其他三个角色和增加可玩性的mod时的想法。
体验下来确实可以说无与伦比，极其出色的游戏（又到幸运时刻了，今年出2！）"

(75% 할인 받은 걸 다행이라고 해야되나) | TLDR: This is a good exploration game, that features 6 major boss fights. It's not terribly long, and it's chill apart from having to deal with a some clunky features in the battle system.

I enjoy this game- it's relatively chill, up until you hit the different area bosses. You can complete each area in any order, so if you want to farm all the health and ability upgrades before doing the bosses, you can. The levels are neat, with some lore spread throughout. The music and voice over are really good, and I appreciate that they decided to record the dialogue in Icelandic. The art is interesting, and I appreciate that they tried to do something unique with it- it really shines with the bosses and creatures, and some of the environments are genuinely lovely. The boss fights are fun, and the the patterns are well telegraphed- I really enjoyed the Ice Jotun, and the Sky Jotun. That doesn't keep it from being frustrating though at times. 

Your character moves slow, the arena maps are large, and the giants have long steps (as they would be expected to have). You spend a lot of time chasing the giants around the arena, for a few hits, before they move again. The god abilities are frustrating to use, as they're on a bar that you cycle through. It's distracting to go from one ability to the next, and you have to watch what ability you have selected, which draws your attention away from the boss. It's easy to overshoot the ability you want, and you can't rearrange the skills to make it easier to get to the skills you need quickly. The selection does cycle from the end , back to the beginning, but that just once again means you sometimes roll past the thing you need. It would have felt more smooth to be able to assign the abilities to key/button presses in order to make better use of muscle memory, and it's hard not to feel like a fair number of deaths are because of this clunky feature. I would use all the abilities more often, if I didn't feel like I had to be on the most helpful skills, all the time, just in case.
I've gotten Odin down to 20% of his health a few times now, and am not sure I will complete the game due to this. I may just youtube the end of the game instead, but it was still enjoyable to try the game overall.

I will say for completionists, there is one persistent bug for the Northern Sky map which does not register you collecting the Mimir check point. This bug has been in the game since at least mid 2023, and hasn't been fixed. In order to get the achievement for completion, you need to change the game file to an older build through steam, and collect it using that version of the game.
Go to ""Properties -> Betas"" and in the ""Beta participation"" drop down menu select ""oldversion - oldversion""; the save files are apparently compatible. | This game is SO SLOW.I would walk, and it would be like 10 seconds to just get across one screen in a whole area. Want to do a heavy attack? Try waiting 3 full seconds for it to strike. Want to hit a boss? You'll walk up to it in 3 seconds, and then it'll slowly pull away, making it impossible to hit, and it'll take another 5 seconds to continue walking until you can hit it.
I found the abilities to be quite useless. I only used the healing, which by the end only recovers about 1/3 of your health (with 3 uses, you can roughly fill your health bar all the way back up once), and Mjolnir, which basically shaved off a few hits during boss battles (and since each attack sequence took anywhere between 10 and 30 seconds, it was a big time-saver). But because it only worked with heavy attacks, you had to basically be on top of it where you could trigger it AND get a heavy swing in before the boss moved again, which was very rare. I don't recall wasting so many limited-use abilities as I did in this game. And I tried triggering the other abilities, which mostly didn't really do anything useful. The shield, for example—if you needed it, you were probably dead, anyway.
For some reason, I wanted to be able to recommend this game because I'm a softie for pretty indie games with worlds that bring to life cultures and myths. But, man, it was almost like they didn't respect my time with this game. I wouldn't mind walking far distances if it was scenic or I felt like things were far away, but sometimes I'd walk for a minute or two only to be staring at my character moving slowly across a nearly blank screen the whole time. | Sevmedim ilk 30 dakikada bana devam ettirme isteği oluşturacak hiç bir şey vermedi.

It is a tower defense, but be aware, PvP brings some unique mechanics not seen often in typical TD game. It's kinda tower defense + auto battler PvP. There is no established name for such type of games, that's why I call it unique. I would call it a ""Tower defense crack"". It has infinite replayability, short matches (~ 20 minutes average), regular updates. It is perfectly balanced. Easy to start, hard to master. No bugs. It has some single player content, but the core game is 2v2 command PvP (or 4v4 mode). It requires internet for PvP.

Like the Ship of Theseus, nearly every part has been replaced, usually for the better but sometimes replaced with inferior versions. The voice acting especially, stood out as a major letdown compared to the original. There's mods to bring back some of it, but it makes me sad that most people won't be installing them and thus won't grow to appreciate the original artistry as I did.

Like imagine someone painted an ""improved"" version of the Mona Lisa. That's great, they could make it appeal to a more modern audience and add their own spin to make it unique, but it's not a replacement for the original. It's not a replacement for the original. 

I can't help but feel like the heart of the game has been altered or diminished. Like it's hard to call it the same game as the one I grew up with and played so much. It's bittersweet. | Um jogo que o que não falta é conteúdo. Ficando frequentemente em promoções altas e ainda mantém servidores vivos com uma comunidade ainda bem presente.

Positives
+ Gameplay is still very much the same as the original - there are no major overhauls of the core mechanics which made previous renditions great
+ Improved resource UI which makes villager management much easier during the crucial first minutes of the game
+ The ability to queue both units and technologies simultaneously
+ The ability to indefinitely re-seed farms and fish traps if you have the available resources
+ Several new units and technologies (such as the Steppe Lancer and Supplies) to balance existing civilisations and provide new ways to play
+ Multiple new single-player / multi-player lobby options, such as game speed, map pool, AI difficulty and type (such as the 'new' AI for Definitive Edition, or the HD and CD AI)
+ You can use the lobby browser for multi-player while waiting in a lobby
+ Your multi-player game stats are tracked, and you can earn player profile pictures from time played, number of victories etc.
+ Improved visual effects (such as collapsing structures, improved unit models and environmental / lighting effects)
+ Improved sound effects, whilst remaining true to the charm of classic Age of Empires II (units have their original voice lines and so on)
+ Massive update to AI commanding in single player games - you can now use the taunt/command system to tell your AI allies to train specific types of units, construct buildings on a flare marker, attack a specific target and so on
+ Several new civilisations with their own unique units
+ Several new historical campaigns
+ Massive improvement to the tutorial system, with new scenarios (Art of War) specifically catered to helping new players deal with managing economies, performing and defending from rushing, etc.
+ Tweaks to the scenario editor (such as copy-pasting event triggers)
+ In-house mod support (Steam workshop has been removed in favour, could be interpreted as a negative)
+ Xbox LIVE profile support and cross-play
+ A ton of different settings to customise your gameplay experience by tweaking controls, graphics, sound and so on (several of these settings also make the game more accessible for individuals experiencing difficulty from handicaps such as colour blindness etc.)
+ Dedicated servers, and private multi-player games appear to run much smoother than HD
+ Steam achievements and trading cards
+ Improved replays and save systems (you can save 'chapters' in a replay for players to watch specific events)

76561197992939661,734020,Legendary DXP,0.2,Casual,0,"I have never written a review for a game before, but this game is so offensive I had too. Do not play this game until they fix it or change some of the features. First of all I bought this way back when it cost money and it was ok the UI was a little clunky and animations dragged a bit, but it allowed you to play solo matches fine. I tried matchmaking then and unfortunatley could never find a match.

Fast forward to now and I decided to play some legendary DXP and nocited they added a bunch of features, a campaign, challanges, ai companions, different matchmaking modes, and more cards. Wow this is great I thought I can't wait to play more. So I mostly play solo and decided to play with the AI, first of all the AI is terrible, you are better off playing two handed and rolling a dice to make the decisions. Now this would be more acceptable if we had the option to play multiple hands, because certain schemes and villians don't work great with the solo rules. Although the biggest issue is that I tried to play four matches and only completed 2, the other two timed out, and every single match had to reconnect to the server at least once, because OF COURSE IN ORDER TO PLAY SOLO YOU NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE DAMN SERVERS. Of course makes perfect sense when I want to play the solo version of a digital board game I need to be connected to the internet. Not only that the net code seems to have been written by a early 2000s chat bot because it is almost impossible to go 3 or 4 turns before there is a connection issue and possible the game just gets stuck in an infinite loop trying to connect to the servers. I would literally be better off taking my hard copy of legendary to starbucks and just randomly staring at people until somebody would join me and play.

Then I thought ok lets try the campaign, well guess what THE DAMN CAMPAIGN IS STUCK TO A HORRIBLE ENERGY SYSTEM! I haven't seen an energy system on a free to play game since candy crush let alone a game I payed full price for before and bought the expansions. Wow well done you guys have literally made a digit al version that is more cumbersome and difficult to play then setting up the physical version.  It would be like if someone made a calculator so terrible that people decided to just ocunt on their fingers instead, BECAUSE THE DAMN CALCULATOR JUST KEPT GETTING STUCK TRYING TO CONNECT TO THE SERVERS. Do not download this game, I believe this game will in the future be used a torture device in order to interrogate criminals, similar to stress positions and water boarding. Do yourself a favour buy the hard copy set it up play with yourself or play with some friends and if you really want to play this version you could easily simulate it by trying to play your hard copy during a hurricane with your hands tied behind your back. At least then you'd be able to play a match. 

Devs if you see this please add a offline mode where you can still level up and earn points for packs if you play by yourself like you had before! And remove this stupid energy system and just have some sort of fee trial of the campaign up to a certain point and maybe pay for the rest. Until then I will uninstall this garbage and go play the hard copy. | The lack of actuall expansions for last 2 years, and lack luster quallity of recent updates, and focus on paid random gatcha nature of visual items show how little to no attention dev gave this game. I'll stick to playing Marvel Legendary on TTS, than waste time on game long since abandoned. | Update: I recommend the game now. The Dev fixed the issue from my previous update. So if you bought the game before it went free to play you no longer have to spend money to buy energy to play. As far as I know, it's still there in the free to play version. Everything else I said about the game still stands so buyer beware.  faults aside it's a fun game when it works, and right now its the only way to play a legendary game online. 

Update: Changed my review to a thumbs down because the dev just put in a crap update. You now have to spend energy to play the game, you buy the energy with game coins, you get the game coins by using real money. This game should be a free to play  since it feels like a mobile app game and not a game I paid for.  

The Good: If you're a fan of the Legendary Marvel Deck Building Game or you wanted to play it; this is the game for you. It's pretty much the basest from the Marvel Deck Building Game with a different skin. The game works as far as I can tell, I haven't come across any card glitches yet. You can also unlock a lot of customization for your account by playing the game and doing leader board challenge stuff. It feels like the devs want to build a fun community for the players.

The Bad: If you've never played the Marvel Deck Building Game this game can frustrate you because you have no idea what the cards do and how they work together unless you play the game 100s of times; the reason this is, is because the devs left out a option to view all the decks before you play. When I get a new card game I like to look at the cards and think of ways they work with each other and what cards are best for different situations, but yo can't do that in this game so far because there is no way to check the cards, you just have to play for a very long period of time to see how the cards work together.

The Ugly: As far as I can tell (I could be wrong) this game requires you to login with a account to play it, which means you can't play this game offline, there's also a in game store to buy card packs; from what I can tell the packs are just cosmetic, it's not pay to win, but there is a expansion you an buy in the store. 

So I recommend this game because it's the only way to play Legendary online right now, but it's not perfect. | I don't often write reviews because often the games I play are pretty straight forward.
My recommendation is mainly focused on the single player campaign.
The game is build as pay-to-win and as you advance in the campaign you play or 1 game a day or spend money on playing more.
Unlike the real paper game the randomness seems to be designed against you.
The interface works but could be so much more intuative and optimized, it feels old fashion if you look at other card games these days.
Personally I kind of regret buying it, I'll keep playing if from time to time in the hope I can get past certain points in the campaign that I would consider in other games to be ""very hard"" | Do yourself a favour and ignore this and buy the physical game.

This is a rubbish mobile port of a FTP game with a rubbish UI that wants you to purchase it for money but doesn't remove the FTP elements like limiting how much you can play through an ""energy"" system that refills slowly over time or if you pay using premium currency. This is a cheap tactic in FTP games to try and get mugs to pay out, but is inexcusable in a game you have to purchase to play.

With the number of hours I'd played I even spent over 100$ supporting the game by buying skins and what not. I enjoyed the flow, the challenge, and the strategy. I know every card. How they're played. How they're countered. 

So why am I giving it a negative review now?  I recently came back to it to find out the game had completely changed. 

Why oh why have the devs decided to remove wild cards (doubles of the same card in the same deck) and duplicate cards (the same card in your teammates deck) in premade team battles?? Half the fun of this game was being able to strategize with a friend and come up with crazy combos, thematic decks, and sometimes just plain goofy ridiculous decks early in the league. I strongly believe the percent chance of drawing a deck defining card or executing your intended combo is a key element of dueling cards in general. Think Magic or Yu Gi Oh. Now a huge part of that fun and build design is just gone.

Effectively, they've changed the game that I originally fell in love with and after over 800 hours I don't think I want to play anymore. What a shame. | Rating: 7/10

Overview: Minion Masters is a fast-paced, free-to-play strategy game that blends elements of tower defense and collectible card games (CCG). Developed by BetaDwarf, the game pits players in 1v1 or 2v2 battles where they summon and control minions to battle against their opponent’s forces, all while managing a deck of cards. With its unique mix of gameplay styles, Minion Masters offers an accessible but strategic experience for fans of both strategy games and card battling.

Gameplay: In Minion Masters, players build and use decks of cards to summon minions, cast spells, and build structures on the battlefield. Each card corresponds to a different type of unit, spell, or structure that players can deploy in real-time. The key to success is not just about deploying powerful units but also about managing your resources (mana), timing your plays, and reacting to your opponent’s strategy.

The game offers several different modes, including standard 1v1 and 2v2, where players can compete against other players or AI. The matches are quick, lasting around 5-10 minutes, which makes it easy to jump into a game and not get bogged down by long sessions. The action is fast-paced, with constant back-and-forth gameplay, making it exciting for those who enjoy real-time strategy with a bit of card game strategy mixed in.

Deck Building and Strategy: The strategic depth of Minion Masters comes from deck building. Players can collect new cards and customize their deck to suit their playstyle, with different minions, spells, and special abilities available to choose from. The key to winning is finding the right balance between offense and defense, while also considering synergy between the cards in your deck. There are a variety of minion types, each with strengths and weaknesses, which adds an extra layer of tactical decision-making to each match.

Progression and Monetization: As with many free-to-play games, Minion Masters includes a progression system where players can unlock new cards and cosmetics by earning rewards from matches or purchasing card packs. While the game is generally balanced and not pay-to-win, there is an option for players to spend money on card packs and other cosmetic items. This could give some players a slight advantage early on, but most progress can still be made through regular gameplay.

Graphics and Performance: Minion Masters features bright, colorful visuals with a somewhat cartoonish art style that fits the fast-paced, playful nature of the game. The minions and spells are well-designed, with each card having its own unique look and animations that help bring the battlefield to life. The game runs smoothly on most systems, and the controls are intuitive, making it accessible for both new players and strategy veterans alike.

Audio Design: The sound design in Minion Masters is solid, with an upbeat soundtrack and engaging sound effects that add to the excitement of the battles. Each card and minion has its own set of sounds, from the footsteps of marching troops to the explosive effects of spells, helping to immerse players in the game’s action. The voice lines of the minions and the announcer are charming and add some personality to the game.

Challenges: While Minion Masters is accessible, there is a learning curve when it comes to building effective decks and mastering the timing and positioning of your units. As players unlock more cards, they can start building more diverse strategies, but the game’s fast pace means you need to react quickly, which can be challenging for newcomers. The game also features matchmaking, but occasionally, you may find yourself up against opponents who have stronger cards if you're not progressing quickly enough.

Final Thoughts: Minion Masters is a fun and fast-paced strategy game that offers a unique blend of collectible card gameplay with real-time strategy. Its quick matches, deck-building mechanics, and strategic depth make it an enjoyable experience for players who enjoy both card games and strategy games. While there’s a progression system that could feel grindy at times, the game remains accessible, and its focus on skill and strategy makes it rewarding for those who stick with it.

Pros:

Fast-paced and accessible gameplay
Strong strategic depth through deck-building and unit placement
Bright, colorful visuals with appealing animations
Free-to-play with fair monetization options
Multiple game modes including 1v1 and 2v2
Cons:

Progression can feel slow at times
Pay-to-progress elements, though not pay-to-win
Some balancing issues, especially at early levels
Can become repetitive if not switching up strategies
Minion Masters is an enjoyable strategy game for those who like quick battles, tactical decision-making, and card collection. While there are some minor progression hurdles, the game offers a solid and fun experience for fans of competitive, strategic gameplay. | This game was fun for a while. I found it late thinking it was a new game. After several months of loving it and playing it almost daily; the fun is now at its end. Nothing new is coming to it. | ""Если бы мне сказали, что я буду проводить ночи напролет, крича на экран из-за толпы миньонов, я бы не поверил. Но вот я здесь, с кругами под глазами и улыбкой до ушей. Minion Masters — это как смесь покера, шахмат и цирка, где все участники слегка не в себе.

Что мне нравится:

Миньоны-психопаты. Серьезно, кто еще будет бросать летающих свиней в драконов? Это гениально!

Стратегия? Шутка? И то, и другое! Ты думаешь, что всё продумал, но тут твой противник выкидывает карту, которая превращает твою армию в лягушек. Лягушек, Карл!

Быстрые матчи. Это как фастфуд, только без угрызений совести. 5 минут — и ты либо герой, либо лузер. Но в любом случае хочется еще.

Что не нравится:

Случайные карты. Иногда тебе выпадает такая рука, что хочется плакать. Но это часть веселья, правда?

Итог: Minion Masters — это идеальная игра для тех, кто хочет немного адреналина, много смеха и возможность почувствовать себя злым гением (или просто неудачником с хорошим чувством юмора). Если вы еще не играли, то что вы вообще делаете со своей жизнью?

Now.... a million miles away from being anything like an MMO. i would re badge the game an offline game that requires an internet connection.

No p2p transfers, no p2p matches anymore.  Literally nothing about the game is player to player anymore other than the fact the AI you are playing is owned by a real player somewhere in the world.

Sorry, but for me, the game was better 2-3 years ago, every change made since has slowly eroded the soul of the game away leaving us with a very sterile and unrewarding experience that has no p2p elements anymore.

Even the chat is outside of the game in steam now lol | After the collapse of FM Online, I was looking to fill the Online Void that FM 22 doesn't quite achieve. Over 700 hours put into this game, and unfortunately it still doesn't feel like I know any more about the match engine or tactics than the 1st day I played. It feels completely random on matchdays, unless you're a Patreon Subscriber getting tips from Devs about how to essentially manipulate the match engine in your favour. The community is a husk of players on Discord, and that's about it. The bones and concepts are reasonable, but the game misses way more than it hits. For a really neat online community, true Global Leagues and much superior Match Engine, i strongly suggest potential players try Browser Games like Hattrick - although ""Comically"" animated, it knows exactly what it is, and most importantly, what it is not. | Well to start off, I've spent many hours playing this game, I watched the devs ruin the game slowly, but i stayed around with the upcoming 2D engine, which i had high hopes for.

I can not recommend this game, especially in it current state even though its an EA Game, i have lost all faith in the devs after there constant updates which seem to ruin the game a little further. the game has great potential but they seem to be content on ruining the engine.

The update they applied recently got rid of all logic (the way the game felt before this update had logic but a few bugs), players are just random, attributes don't matter, teams getting red cards not getting a disadvantage, players getting injuries(knocks) not affecting the game at all. goals are generally only scored from long shots, keepers atts don't seem to matter at all either. crossing is still not implemented, played many games and there is little to no crosses. (no matter what i set the sliders too). The 2D engine is not at all fun to watch, i found myself getting bored of watching high passing/vision players miss pass the ball constantly. High crossing/vision players constantly hit the ball in front of them for a GK instead of crossing the ball. Freekicks and corners are not really working right now, offside goals are even more now even after they ""patched"" it so offside goals are less likely, players will run away from a ball that is coming towards them it all in all feels like a broken game. they nerfed strikers, there are rarely any goals from inside the box now, its all long distance goals at a stupid range or angle. Freekick goals from the halfway line are downright dumb, something that the devs seem to not want to fix.

Players will constantly back pass in attacking positions even when they are unmarked, players rarely go into attacking positions, strikers will sometimes back pass to defenders while clean through on goal.

I intentionally bought some Low First Touch players, they have never done a bad first touch since watching them play, but high 18-20 attributed first touch players will do bad first touches, it feels badly coded and slowly getting worse as they continue to update it.

They also keep taking away features, they put the ability to request friendlies and under 18/21's youth teams behind a paywall, you must subscribe to be able to have access to them, having under 18/21's youth teams is a great way to make easy money... even if the players are terrible they will still make money from the development/playing games, you can still buy youth players and develop them, but is no where near as effective as having under 18/21 youth teams. 

A Feature they also took a way was a working transfer system, that allowed players to interact with each other, negotiate, making it feel like a online management game, the current system they have in place is bland... just choose players from a pool, i understand why they removed the working transfer system (due to exploiters and cheaters), but still over the course of development they are taking features away more than adding them, which shows in 
the amount of players playing the game currently, it does not feel like a MMO game at all. 

I Do not recommend this game, even with the small price tag. I've slowly watched the game get worse over the many hours I've spent playing this game.

- Bad 2D engine, which in its current state is a Game Breaker
- Player Stats dont seem to matter much
- Boring Transfer System
- Dev's taking away features more than adding them
- Game feels more single player than multiplayer | Well nothing bad to say , game is good but if you want to play , you have to pay 7 euros every month because premium is a HUGE team buff. Everyone can decide if it's a good or a bad deal. I don't like to pay every month , better buy a game for 40-50 euros than spend 7 every month.

- I'm not a Dune series / movies fan
- Very good tutorial; I also watched someone explain the physical board game to get more of the references
- Match making system is every 30 minutes, they start matches of 3-4 players.
- Matches last about 2.5 hours. I felt a bit drained after my first match, mostly because of the length. On the one side I felt this was way too long, but there were some turns where I wish I had more time to execute my actions, so I guess it's just right really.
- Feels like development on this game is thoughtful and intentional, and the UI is easy to navigate. Makes me think the developers actually made a game they'd play too :) | I’ve been really enjoying Dune: Imperium! As someone who loves the original board game, I was excited to see how they’d translate it to digital, and I think they nailed it.

Gameplay: The mix of worker placement and deck-building is super fun. There are so many ways to approach the game, whether you want to focus on faction alliances, resource gathering, or just go all-in on combat. I’ve played quite a few times, and each game has felt different, which keeps things interesting.

Visuals and Sound: The visuals are gorgeous! The art does a fantastic job of capturing the Dune vibe, and the interface is pretty easy to get the hang of. Plus, the music and sound effects really add to the immersion—sometimes I just sit back and soak it all in. | 电影书籍桌游，沙丘好玩的无需多言 | The board game itself is really fun, and this implementation is as good

I'd like to see more options in creating a pro-style league, instead of just college. | Full disclosure I was on a playtest team for the game and have been playing since the beta test so I may have some positive bias here.

I know people don't like long reviews so I'll just say... I like it so far. It obviously has the bugs and glitches that you would expect for an early release. No play action passes yet? No pro/franchise yet? Yeah, it's coming.

I'd suggest that since the base game is free, just try it out and play it, the game play is actually very nice and it's a visually great game. I do want to address the elephant in the room, and that is how people are upset about the pricing tiers and in-game purchases when it was marketed as a ""free to play"" game. On some extent I can understand and don't think it was a good idea to market the game as free when obviously there would have to be paid items and not being clear what those things would be. But on the other hand, was anyone expecting that a game of this sophistication would be COMPLETELY free? Come on, really. Yes there is paid DLC. But considering you can do a lot for free and most of the big modes require no more than the $20 tier which is pretty cheap for a game like this, all this stuff has to be paid for somehow, right? We're in the Internet Youtube age where everyone expects to have everything for free and without making societal comment, there are too many people who just don't grasp that things they like cost money.

As for features, I have not yet tried the dynasty mode since pre-release, but as I said the game plays well. The MPL mode that's the card-based team building online play, I had some doubts about it at first but found it quite addictive I haven't even bothered to go into franchise yet.  

Of course there are some genuine negatives I find, beyond the obvious growing pains of bugs and glitches. 
One thing that disappoints me is the lack of difficulty settings. I'm not very good at playing games like this and the game does move fast. The passing game has to be worked out yet, receivers don't go for the ball well, and interceptions, turnovers and blocked kicks are too frequent. Kicking is more  challenging than it should be. The developers are against putting in sliders but I wish we had SOME difficulty control.

I could write a book about all the good and bad things but come on, try it for yourself. Play a few games, collect a few cards, get in a few online matches (those are in the free version) and you can even earn a few dynasty seasons just from challenges. What have you got to lose? You've got hundreds of hours of good football play to gain.

I honestly, and yes this is my bias again, think that many of the bad reviews are people pissed off that the entire game isn't free. Oh we love Youtube but get annoyed that it has to be paid for by ads. Seriously? Try it you'll be glad you did. It's far from perfect but just by downloading and playing you're showing your support and the developers are truly dedicated to making this a top-quality game which is more than I can say about certain AAA studios out there. | The customization that currently exists is a cut above and will make this game be the best in its class once they get a few more things done as they ramp up to full access. | fumble and pick sim. no flags. card packs, BOOOOOOOOOOOO"

Slice & Dice is beyond any doubt the best dice-building roguelike ever made. I've tried a LOT of dice-building roguelikes and haven't like any of them...except for Slice & Dice, which is one of the greatest roguelikes of all time. Just, look, if you play any turn-based roguelikes at all, of any flavor, you need to at least try Slice & Dice. I simply cannot emphasize enough how incredible this game is.

My YouTube playlist if you want to watch before you buy:

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN735uyn0raWf1CgI9czCm7mkLGAgbkEt | It's a great way to spend some time, easily the best dice based game i've played. I recommend it to any fan of turnbased games, especially roguelike rpg fans.

Pros:
• Sound Design and top notch
• UI is nice
• Gameplay loop is excellent
• Just the right amount of RNG to keep things interesting
• Lots of stuff to unlock but also the ability to just unlock everything from the start for people 
  with totally burnt out dopamine receptors
• Lots of options to tinker with in the options menu
• Moddable
• Many interesting modes
• Good variety of classes
• Lots of Run modifiers you can add to many modes
• Extremely good value for your money

Cons:
• The visuals were designed for phone sized screens, playing full screen makes many of the 
  images look bad, i play in windowed mode with it taking about half the screen for this reason
• For all the item and run variety there could be more normal base monster variety
• The Game throws a bit too many steam achievements at you | 如果说常常能见到某些游戏下“想法好的，但执行坏了”的评价，那《Slice and Dice》在我看来则正好相反，属于“想法一般，但执行神了”的特例。

最初玩demo的时候我对这游戏是有些看走眼的，因为近年的骰子类型游戏太多了而本作的“以骰面代技能，不同角色有不同骰子，通过组合骰子战斗”的核心玩法其实已经不算新鲜了，更况且骰面技能看起来非常简单，也无外乎打2盾2再来点什么顺劈耗竭中毒词条，不像是很有花活的样子。
但在体验了一番后发现，本作确实不需要太多花活(虽然后面解锁的绿系整活角色也不少)，仅仅靠最朴实无华的技能组合、角色搭配、法术战技、敌人机制、装备祝福等的协同效应，通过积累丰富充足的内容量，再加上精妙的玩法编排，佐以策略与随机的平衡，便能支撑起整个简洁质朴、馅足料实的玩法循环了。

游戏对战斗内外的兼顾非常到位，避免了不少策略类游戏常有的要么偏重bd战斗操作无聊，要么bd轻度全靠局内。每个角色的骰子都像是玩家为其量身定做的战术模块，技能释放和敌人机制的动态博弈，让每一次战斗决策都是策略层和操作层的有机融合。装备、祝福、变化、挑战，每次战后升级选择都牵动着整个战力体系的平衡和提升。可以说，每一次投掷，每一次决策，每一次升级，每一次选择……都能够感受强烈的正反馈循环体验。原来，仅仅是改变和操控骰面就能如此有趣！

游戏在细节上的打磨也很出色处理，无论是选项中各种亲民的选项，丰富的模式拓展以及便利的自定义功能，都能给我一种作者相当懂游戏的感觉。

目前游戏最令人头疼的一大问题是难度曲线太不平滑了，游戏默认的难度递增就好似进阶4到进阶10到进阶20到进阶40的陡峭跨度，进阶等级间强度跳跃缺乏缓冲。给人一种要么选择高难度被突然膨胀的难度暴打，要么就狼狈逃跑回去玩低难度的感觉。外加祝福/诅咒这个系统有点太“重”了，即使低等级诅咒也能带来巨大压力，却又要在少量选择中强制要求多个叠加，使游戏难以实现同类肉鸽作品常见的渐进式体验。

其实玩多了游戏经常感觉，虽然很多人可能认为创意很重要，有些游戏能有一个好的点子多么伟大，但知名游戏制作人的采访后可以看出，他们从来不缺好的想法和点子，真正关键的是如何将一些好点子展开成一个完成度很高的游戏的能力。而《Slice and Dice》正是用实践证明了一个朴实的玩法循环无需堆砌加法，当每个骰面都经过精心调试，当每项基础机制都达到深度协同，最朴实的玩法循环也能迸发出惊人的策略魅力。 | one of my favorite roguelites. something I appreciate here is how transparent the game mechanics are. you always know what enemies can do and how their abilities work, and what the probability is that they'll do a given action, which makes it feel more fair than some other roguelites imo | got more than 150 hours on phone. addicting, fun & one of the best complexity curve out there. easy to learn and got enough complex mechanism there too. only complaint is that pc ui is not as clean and pleasing as phone ui. beside that game is a gem"

aunched  and it was AMAZING with tons of players and hype....

then you took it down and killed ALL of the momentum and popularity then RE-released it with TONS of micro-transactions and bs grindy features no one wanted. you could have just released the game AS IS and added more characters and maps and had a success. now? we get to lose all the potential this game had and no one who spent money on anything is getting refunded? i have MORE tokens for free characters than u even released....like tf?

and then instead of at least keeping it up so we can play youre shutting EVERYTHING down? WB..stop making games....just license them to someone who isnt a greedy r#t@rd and ACTUALLY cares about the properties involved.....after this i refuse to EVER buy any game made by them or give money to WB again. so sick of them killing games less than a YEAR after its official release....



please someone steal the code or something so we can at least keepo this game going via p2p or fan servers.  or maybe someone buy it form them and release it as an ACTUAL finished game instead of locking everything behind TONS of grind and paywall | This game was peak when it first came out and was probably the most fun I've had in gaming in a long time. But after being shut down for a year and coming back to this, it just makes me sick. This game really isn't fun if you play it for rank like me you will destroy your mental because this game is still broken after that year gap. Even with the new changes in combat this game is just not it, very ass backwards dev. I'm not sure what can be done for this game very sad to see where its at now after loving the beta. I've spend $100 on the founders edition for the game I once loved, now this game is just a joke. | This plays like molasses. I can't believe I spent 100 bucks on the Founder's Edition for the game I was supporting in beta to be nothing like the game that's shutting down later. F Warner Bros. | Can't say I'm surprised the game's shutting down but the abruptness and way it's being handled sucks. I strongly recommend reading the most recent announcement but tl;dr they've disabled purchasing gleamium and people that have the game are required to log in between Feb 4th and May 30th to be able to play the game offline as afterwards they will be disabling online and taking the game off stores. I feel like this is going too far too soon. They should keep the game on stores and available for everyone even if it is just offline at the very least.

My friends and I enjoyed Multiversus back in the closed alpha + open beta and I unfortunately bought a founder's pack thinking the game would last and continue to be enjoyable. They all stopped playing after the changes made to the full release but I came back to play a bit when they started adding more Cartoon Network characters like Jack, PPG, and Marceline. Despite owning every character in the game I have a lot of spare currency from that pack such as character tickets that I'll never be able to use. There has been no word about any kind of compensation. Something as simple as being able to exchange unused currency for gleamium would be nice. There are some cosmetics that I would've liked to purchase and have after the game shuts down.

It's a shame the game failed. I feel like there was potential but changing the gameplay and upping the grind for getting characters did irreversible damage to the game's reputation. Reception in my friend group went from positive to ""I'm never touching this game again."" There was also a bit of confusion when the game was taken offline after the open beta as it felt like it had already released with 2 seasons of content.

I'd like to see another Warner Bros. crossover game someday. Hopefully it won't turn out as bad as this one did. | The Warner Bros. greed took over, now its shutting down after season 5. Added cool characters WAY to late

if only they listened to the players and actually cared, this game had potential.

Aside from that, its not terrible. Just not good either. Which sadly already puts it in the top 10% of Warhammer games I guess."

76561197974286855,220,Half-Life 2,0.11666666666666667,Action,0,"A monumental game in my gaming career, Half-Life 2 was that defining experience that made me realise I was in for something next level. For the first time i picked it up on The Orange Box in 2008, and from the moment I booted it up, I knew I was in for a wild ride. It wasn’t just a game—it was an event. The environments were absolutely massive, the atmosphere was unreal, and the soundtrack? Edgy as hell. Every moment felt like a cinematic journey.

In Half-Life 2, you play as Gordon Freeman, arguably one of the most reluctant action heroes in gaming. You awaken from stasis, burdened with the trauma of the previous game, and are immediately thrust into action as the figurehead of an uprising. This isn’t a simple revolution—it’s a battle against a multiversal alien threat, shrouded in dystopian themes and orchestrated by secretive organizations manipulating events behind the scenes.

Set in a world dominated by the Combine, an alien regime that combines interdimensional authoritarianism with advanced technology, you must navigate a planet under their control. Armed with little more than a crowbar and your signature nonverbalism, Gordon becomes the key figure in the resistance. As you progress, you'll engage in intense combat, solve puzzles, explore diverse environments, and uncover the unsettling truth that nothing in this world is as it seems.

And let’s talk about The G-Man—a mysterious, interdimensional CIA glowman who pops up like a bad dream and probably controls the entire charade like a cosmic puppeteer. Is he good? Is he bad? Is he just playing the long game? Who knows, but he’s definitely got his hand in everything, watching Gordon like a hawk, pulling strings like an invisible god. 

You’d think it’s just a sci-fi conspiracy, but after a while, you start questioning if anyone really knows what the hell is going on. Does G-Man even have a purpose, or is he just a cosmic observer who gets his kicks out of watching a man with a crowbar take on the end of the world?

The game’s narrative feels like a giant puzzle, and each step forward opens up even more questions, all while you’re tearing through enemy lines, trying to get answers. And the best part? It’s not all about combat—there are puzzles to solve, mysteries to uncover, and a sense of isolation that keeps you on edge, constantly wondering who or what will show up next. The pacing is incredible, making you feel like you’re a tiny piece of something far larger, with consequences that span across dimensions.

Now when the episodes are combines (haha) The user experience is smooth and now it is even moddable! 5/5 | 之前20周年更新开发者评论模式后我又打了一遍，阀是怎样做到的，让我反复爱上它们的游戏。在游戏里跟开发者评论一起探索是我最喜欢的事，我喜欢看游戏开发历程和小故事，实在是让人大开眼界。

Released in 2004 by Valve, it redefined what players could expect from a video game in terms of both storytelling and gameplay. The game’s narrative is immersive, unfolding without traditional cutscenes, which allows the player to feel like they are truly part of the story. The protagonist, Gordon Freeman, is a silent hero who navigates through a dystopian world filled with alien invaders and oppressive human forces. This unique approach to storytelling pulls the player into the game’s world, making every action feel meaningful.

The physics engine in ""Half-Life 2"" was revolutionary for its time. The way objects interact with the environment feels natural and intuitive, and it became a major part of the gameplay. From solving puzzles using physics to creatively using the environment as a weapon, it was an innovation that influenced many games that followed. The gravity gun, which allows players to manipulate objects in real-time, is still one of the most memorable and fun weapons in gaming history.

The level design in ""Half-Life 2"" is another standout feature. The game introduces players to varied environments, from the dark, industrial city of City 17 to the eerie, remote marshlands. Each location feels carefully crafted, with attention to detail that makes the world feel alive. The pacing is also masterful, alternating between moments of intense combat and slower, atmospheric sequences that allow the player to soak in the environment and story.

The AI in ""Half-Life 2"" was also ahead of its time. Enemies behave intelligently, using cover, working together, and reacting to the player’s actions in a way that makes combat more dynamic and challenging. The enemy variety, from the terrifying Combine soldiers to the creepy headcrabs, keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging. The interactions with NPCs and the world around you help build a sense of tension and immersion, keeping you on edge throughout the experience.

The game's soundtrack, composed by Kelly Bailey, perfectly complements the atmosphere, using subtle but effective music to enhance both the action and the quieter moments. The sound design is top-notch, with ambient sounds adding to the immersion, whether you're in a busy city street or exploring a deserted warehouse.

Ultimately, ""Half-Life 2"" is a masterpiece that still holds up to this day. Its innovative gameplay, storytelling, and technical achievements make it a game that set a new standard for the industry. It’s a game that’s not just fun to play, but one that’s easy to appreciate for the way it shaped the future of video games. Even though it’s been years since its release, ""Half-Life 2"" remains a classic that continues to inspire both players and developers alike.

 | game is fire but whoever designed the puzzles and the vehicle section i hope you never work in games again. also barney thick as hell | Half-Life 2 is quite a game and i don't know what to say about it other than its a personal favourite. I think its one of my favourite of the Half-Life games just for all the upgrades it brings. The physics and all the new graphics and visuals. Its truly a great leap in the series and i love how far the story has come and how everything was ended nicely.

The story was more developed and the characters had more dialogue with each other and you saw some past characters return quite nicely. The aliens returned in this sequel to the first Half-Life and once again you had to beat them back. You are led through multiple chapters in the game defeating enemies and playing through some thought provoking puzzles as per the series standard.

One thing i miss is that the game ended on an unfortunate cliff hanger and so far there seems to be no sign of a sequel at all. The story needs finishing and has spent way to long without any news at all about its future and will be in limbo for some time.

The game without a doubt in my mind is the best in the series and one of my favourites. Its a easy game to recommend anyone try out and play in the future."

Counter-Strike: Source (CS: Source) is the definitive version of one of the most iconic tactical shooters ever created. Built on the Source engine, it brought stunning graphics, refined mechanics, and an immersive experience that kept players engaged for years. It improved upon its predecessor, Counter-Strike 1.6, and laid the foundation for future games in the series, including Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Here's why CS: Source remains a perfect 10/10 for fans of competitive gaming.

Why It’s a Must-Play
🔫 Precise Gunplay
At the core of CS: Source is its tight and rewarding gun mechanics. Every weapon in the game feels unique, with its own recoil patterns and handling characteristics. This precision-driven combat is one of the key factors that makes CS: Source such a compelling competitive experience. From the M4A4's controlled spray to the AWP's one-shot kills, every engagement requires skill and accuracy.

🌍 Map Design & Tactical Depth
The iconic maps like Dust 2, Inferno, and Nuke are where the game shines brightest. Each map is meticulously designed to offer a balance of tactical positions, choke points, and strategic opportunities. Whether you're defending bomb sites or pushing through tight corridors, the map design fosters deep teamwork and careful planning.

💥 Gameplay Mechanics
CS: Source features smooth, fluid movement, making it easy to peek around corners, hold angles, and strafe while shooting. The buy system gives players the freedom to choose their preferred weapons and gear, while round-based gameplay forces teams to be efficient with their resources and execute well-planned strategies.

🎮 Vibrant Community & Modding Support
The modding community for CS: Source has been incredibly active, creating a wealth of custom content from maps to skins to even entirely new game modes. This extends the life of the game by offering nearly endless ways to enjoy the experience. The server browser lets players dive into unique community-run servers, making every session feel fresh and exciting.

🎨 Improved Visuals
Powered by the Source engine, CS: Source delivered a massive graphical leap from its predecessors, offering realistic lighting, better textures, and advanced physics. These improvements gave the game a more immersive and polished feel, while the physics engine introduced interactive objects and destructible environments, adding a layer of depth to gameplay.

What Makes It a 10/10
CS: Source isn’t just a game; it’s a tactical masterpiece that’s stood the test of time. Its emphasis on team coordination, strategy, and individual skill is unmatched. Whether playing with friends or random players, the experience fosters a strong sense of community and competition, making each match feel meaningful. The team-based objectives – like bomb planting/defusal – combined with tight, tactical combat is a dynamic experience that few shooters can replicate.

The longevity of CS: Source is a testament to how well it was designed. While newer titles in the series (like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive) have taken inspiration from it, the smoothness of the gameplay, iconic maps, and endless customization options keep it relevant in the competitive FPS scene.

If you’re a fan of shooters and haven’t experienced CS: Source, you’re missing out on one of the most influential and well-rounded tactical shooters ever made. It’s a game that offers both depth and accessibility, making it suitable for casual players, yet still offering enough challenge for the competitive elite. CS: Source is a timeless classic—pure, competitive, and still as enjoyable today as it was when it first released. | The switch to the Source engine brought improved graphics and physics, but the gameplay changed slightly. Fans of 1.6 were divided, but the game still stands as a solid classic shooter."

Half-Life: Source, released in 2004 by Valve, is an enhanced version of the original 1998 masterpiece, running on the Source engine. While it aimed to improve the visuals, physics, and water effects, it failed to live up to expectations, making it a divisive version among fans.

Despite still delivering the legendary Half-Life experience, this remaster feels more like a rushed port than a true upgrade.

What Works Well?
🧪 Same Brilliant Gameplay as Half-Life
At its core, Half-Life: Source is still Half-Life—one of the most influential FPS games ever made. The engaging story, immersive atmosphere, and smart enemy AI remain intact, making this version playable and enjoyable.

🌊 Improved Water Effects and Physics
The transition to the Source engine brings better physics (thanks to Havok) and improved water reflections, which make certain areas look more modern compared to the 1998 original.

🖥️ Smoother Performance and Native Support
Half-Life: Source runs natively on modern systems, avoiding the compatibility issues that can arise with the original GoldSrc version. Higher resolutions and widescreen support are also a plus.

The Problems with Half-Life: Source
❌ Barely Any Real Graphical Upgrade
Despite running on Source, most textures, models, and lighting effects remain unchanged from 1998. This makes it feel less like a true remaster and more like a basic port with minimal effort.

❌ Buggy AI and Broken Scripted Sequences
Some of Half-Life’s iconic scripted moments don’t work properly in Half-Life: Source, breaking immersion. Enemies and NPCs sometimes behave worse than in the original, which is unacceptable for an ""improved"" version.

❌ No High-Definition (HD) Model Pack
Unlike Half-Life’s official 1999 update, which introduced better character and weapon models, Half-Life: Source lacks these HD assets—making it feel graphically inferior to an older update of the game.

❌ Black Mesa Exists
If you want to experience Half-Life with Source engine upgrades, Black Mesa (a fan-made, Valve-approved remake) is a far superior alternative with fully reworked graphics, animations, and improved gameplay mechanics.

Conclusion
Half-Life: Source is not a bad way to play Half-Life, but it's also not the best. If you want the original experience, the GoldSrc version is more authentic. If you want a true Source engine remake, Black Mesa is the better choice.

🔹 Rating: 7/10 – Still a great game, but an underwhelming remaster."

Half-Life: Deathmatch: Source is a multiplayer first-person shooter developed by Valve. It is a remake of the classic Half-Life deathmatch mode, utilizing the Source engine. The game combines the fast-paced action of traditional deathmatch with updated graphics and more fluid movement mechanics. While it successfully brings new life to the original concept, some mechanical issues and a niche player base prevent it from being as popular as its predecessors.

What Works Well?
🎮 Classic Deathmatch Gameplay
The core of Half-Life: Deathmatch is its tight, fast-paced combat. It stays true to the original deathmatch mode, offering classic weapons, high-speed action, and simple, enjoyable mechanics. The formula remains as fun today as it was when first introduced.

🌆 Updated Graphics with Source Engine
The move to the Source engine has significantly improved the visuals compared to the original. The lighting, textures, and models are much sharper, breathing new life into the iconic Half-Life universe. The environments feel more immersive, and physics interactions are more dynamic.

🔫 Familiar Weapon Set
Players have access to a variety of classic weapons from the Half-Life series, including the crowbar, shotgun, and crossbow, all of which perform as expected. Each weapon has its own strategic value, and they all function well within the confines of the deathmatch setting.

🛠️ Modding Support and Custom Servers
As with other Source engine games, Deathmatch: Source allows for a robust modding community. Players can easily find custom servers and user-created content, from new maps to modified gameplay modes, keeping the experience fresh.

What Could Be Better?
❌ Limited Popularity and Player Base
Despite its solid foundation, Half-Life: Deathmatch: Source suffers from a relatively small player base. As newer games in the genre continue to dominate, it can be difficult to find active matches, especially in more niche servers.

❌ Physics Can Feel Clunky
While the Source engine improved many aspects of the game, some of the physics—especially in terms of movement—can feel a little awkward compared to modern shooters. The transition to 3D space feels a bit more restrictive than anticipated, particularly when compared to the fluidity of more modern games.

❌ No Significant Gameplay Innovation
While the updated graphics and better physics are great, Deathmatch: Source doesn't introduce any major changes to the original formula. It feels more like a polished port rather than a revolutionary step forward for the genre. Players expecting something drastically new may be disappointed.

❌ Lack of Meaningful Progression
Like many classic deathmatch games, there’s a lack of meaningful progression or any form of unlockable content. While this keeps the focus on pure skill-based play, some players may miss the more modern systems that reward long-term engagement.

Conclusion
Half-Life: Deathmatch: Source is a solid multiplayer shooter for fans of the classic Half-Life experience. Its updated visuals and iconic weapons deliver the fun, high-speed action that fans love, but its small player base and lack of major innovation hold it back from achieving greater popularity. If you’re looking for nostalgic deathmatch action or enjoy modding, it’s a great choice, but don’t expect a revolutionary experience.

Rating: 7/10 – Fun for fans of classic shooters, but somewhat limited by its age and player base. 🎮💥 | It’s good and there are still servers if ur in europe buy it if ur not in eu you’ll probably have shit connection so don’t | 这老东西没人玩了，只能选人数不到两位数的服务器进去小玩一下。

Released in 2005, Day of Defeat: Source is a masterpiece of tactical, team-based combat, offering players an incredibly immersive World War II experience. Powered by the Source engine, the game manages to blend historical authenticity with thrilling action, all while delivering highly strategic, competitive gameplay. Even years after its release, it still holds up as one of the best multiplayer shooters out there. Here’s why Day of Defeat: Source earns a perfect 10/10 rating.

Why Day of Defeat: Source Is a Must-Play
💥 Authentic WWII Combat
Day of Defeat: Source stands out by offering a truly authentic World War II experience without sacrificing fun gameplay. The game features historical maps that take players across iconic battlegrounds in Europe, such as the Normandy beaches and the streets of Stalingrad. The sound design, including gunfire, explosions, and ambient battle noises, creates an incredibly immersive atmosphere that makes you feel like you're truly on the frontlines.

🔫 Varied and Balanced Classes
The game offers a wide range of playable classes, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. From the rifleman to the machine gunner and the sniper, each role adds depth and tactical complexity to the game. The classes are perfectly balanced, ensuring no single class is overpowered, and teamwork is essential for success. Whether you prefer to lead the charge or provide supporting fire, there's a class for everyone.

🎮 Strategic, Team-Oriented Gameplay
At the heart of Day of Defeat: Source is its team-based objective gameplay. Unlike many fast-paced shooters, success isn’t determined by your individual skill, but rather by how well you work with your teammates. Objectives such as capturing points or defending strategic locations encourage coordinated team efforts, making every match feel dynamic and rewarding. This focus on teamwork sets the game apart from others in the genre.

⚔️ Smooth and Engaging Combat
The combat mechanics in Day of Defeat: Source are smooth and engaging, with a focus on accuracy, strategy, and timing. The game’s shooting mechanics are satisfying, and the different weapon types require careful control, whether it’s the bolt-action rifles or the automatic submachine guns. The Source engine brings this all to life with excellent physics, realistic recoil, and fluid animations, creating a satisfying shooting experience.

🌍 Classic Maps and Modding Community
Maps such as Avalanche, Dawnville, and Kalt remain fan favorites for their brilliant design, balance, and flow. These maps are also mod-friendly, encouraging players to create custom content, expanding the game’s replay value. The active community has contributed to the longevity of Day of Defeat: Source, with fan-made maps, mods, and servers providing new ways to enjoy the game even years after its release.

What Makes It a 10/10
Day of Defeat: Source doesn’t just rely on nostalgia; it holds up as a compelling and timeless shooter. The blend of historical accuracy, strategic depth, and intense teamwork creates a gaming experience that is both challenging and rewarding. While its visual style might feel dated by today’s standards, the focus on gameplay mechanics and team collaboration makes it feel as fresh and exciting as when it first released. It’s the kind of game that stands the test of time, offering unmatched fun and depth.

If you’re looking for a WWII shooter that’s all about tactics and teamwork, Day of Defeat: Source is a must-play. Whether you’re a newcomer to the series or a long-time fan, the experience it offers remains second to none. 10/10, this game remains an all-time favorite for those who love tactical shooters. | I have a lot more in this game than 173 hours, trust me.

Yıl 2006, abim arkadaşından ilk bilgisayarımızı satın almıştı. Eve kurduklarında bu bilgisayarın nasıl bi şey olduğunu anlamaya çalışıyordum. Ateri gibi bi şey miydi neydi artık abilerimden fırsat kalırsa öğrenecektim. Kurulumu bitiren abi kısa bi tanıtım yapmıştı. Hatta içinde iki tane oyun kurduklarını söylemişti. Biri The Operative: No One Lives Forever'dı. Diğeri de benim çocukluk travmam olan QUAKE 3 ARENA. Okuldan geldiğimde hemen oynamaya koyulmuştum. Phobos'tan çok korkuyordum. Oyunu kurcalaya kurcalaya sinematik bölümünden tanıtım videosunu görmüştüm. Çok farklı ya anlatamam öyle böyle bir travma değil. Bir keresinde okulda deneme sınavına girmeyip evde Quake 3 oynayıp annemden dayak bile yemiştim. Daha 11 yaşında bir çocuğun maruz kaldığı temalara baksanıza; karanlık atmosfer, oyun haritasında dolaşırken oyunun yapımcısının kesik kafasını görmek, zindanda göğsünden asılmış ceset, öldürdüğünüzde parçalanan cesetler,  boşlukta aşağı düşerken karakterimizin attığı çığlık, haritada spectator olup haritanın dışında ne olduğunu görmeye çalışıp sınırlı bir alanı gözlemleyebildiğiniz bir yokluk...

Virtualmente perfecto.
Algo que no se suele hablar, o nunca escuche en críticas, es que no me deja de sorprender la excelente dirección artística, aún conociendo a sus directores.  Esos cielos morados, los mousntros llenos de putrefacción, armaduras con herrumbe, ladrillos naranja... Excelente.

La primera expansión es buenísima. Aprovecharon todo lo que podía hacer el motor. Se nota que no fue realizado por IdSoftware; la variedad de entornos y la profundidad de sus mapas da más juego a una obra que necesitaba ser más exprimida. | zamanında ortalığı kasıp kavurmuş hızlı oynanışıyla adeta hipnoz eden bir yapım döneme göre tabiki grafikler kötü ama 2025 yılında bile oynanır hala aynı şekilde eğlenceli tabiki bu biraz geliştirilmiş hali ilk hali değil, 1. şahıs fps türünde türün önünü açan yapımlardan bir tanesi | A truly fun FPS about stopping unholy forces and the people assisting them from trying to take over our home (I am unclear if it's Earth or this dimension but it's certainly one of them) with the use of a variety of guns.

This is one of the first, if not the first, game to to be in a truly 3D environment. It's also among the first to have music-music in a game, the soundtrack of which is made by Nine Inch Nails (with plenty of atmosphere segments). This game is also the reason we have games like Half Life and Team Fortress today, because of it's engine.
This game has flashing lights, but they can be changed in the settings. It also mutes when you alt-tab.
You have multiple different campaigns on offer, and while they CAN be played in any order, I recommend playing in the order that is displayed, as they will only get harder and harder the further down you go, regardless of the difficulty you choose. You can also play the campaigns with other people, though if you're achievement hunting, you must go in alone.
Speaking of achievements, there seems to be something a bit wonky going on with some of them, as at least for me a few did not pop even though I fulfilled their requirements.
As for multiplayer, the modes I personally played were capture the flag and a free-for-all death match with some friends, and both were fun, but very under populated, and very much meant for more people than we had. If you can get a group of 6 or more people together though, I highly recommend giving it a try.
ALSO, if you have any plans to stream this game to Twitch or Youtube, it would be wise to mute the game's music, as it will get your vod muted.

Now go, and save us from the evil forces of Quake! | Quake was a game changer in the fps world when it was released in '96 for DOS computers, with a fully 3D environment that was unlike any other FPS game at the time (and would likely cause your Non-Pentium/3D accelerated Computers to explode (JK, it would be unplayable tho)) all while retaining the addictive, fast paste and very difficult gameplay of the doom games, the game also had  some of the best multiplayer experiences of the 90s thanks to it's ability to connect with other players on the internet much easier than most other games at the time (Of course LAN Parties were still a huge thing back then too), and while many games have surpassed it since then, the legacy this game had on the gaming world is HUGE,  in fact without it we wouldn't have the fps games we have today (heck there would be No Half Life or Team Fortress without Quake, since both games were originally developed with Quake engine  before being moved to VALvE's very own Goldsce engine). 

And the game is still relatively fun (for the most part) in 2024 and the remake (being Developed by Nightdive) is Almost Perfect, sure  Animation Interpolation is on by default for some reason and i'm not really a big fan of the games Enhanced Models, but playing this game In 4K HD with proper widescreen and retaining the Legendary Nine Inch Nails Music, and for $10 It's an absolute Steal for such an Awesome remaster, and if you (for some reason) don't like the Remaster, the game still has all the original Winquake,GLQuake and Original DOS files if you want to play it on a source port (Keep in mind that the Steam Version of the NON remastered versions of the game Do not have the NIN soundtrack due to copyright issues (despite GOG having it) so you have to find them elsewhere)

I rarely see the point in leaving reviews for old games - especially ones decades-old like Quake 2. But Nightdive and everyone involved in this remaster should be proud.

Not only is the remaster itself top-notch, but the new expansion is probably just about the best Quake 2 has to offer.

The maps are fantastic - huge, multi-tiered levels - all thematically different, atmospheric, and most of all - challenging and engaging (especially on Hard and above), The new weapons absolutely fit in with the original arsenal, and the newer enemy roster adds so much to the feel and flow of the game.

When Quake ll came out many people were understandably outraged at it not being a continuation of the critically acclaimed Quake but the first thing that you need to realize about this game is that though it shares a name and basic gameplay with one of the first and best 3D games ever made it is its own beast. The guns feel utterly blissful to shoot, the enemies are interesting bastards that you feel no remorse in committing genocide on, and the movement is as fast and responsive as you could want in a true boomer shooter.

If this was fixed the game would be perfect 10/10. 

As you build up your army organically against the King its population value can sometimes too drastically lower Rebel Sentiment to initiate the Revolution. So you could have towns that are in the high 90% of being pro Independence and being ready to go yet the Overall Score is stuck in the low 30%. This is completely lopsided and after I did everything right with the right buildings, founding fathers etc. 

In essence it's too much of a trade-off between growing your population/army along with maintaining the popularity needed to initiate the revolution. This SHOULD NOT BE A TRADE OFF! This catch 22 problem means you can't win the game as reasonably due to Strategy/Design Error. The best way to fix this is to remove Military Units from the calculation of Rebel Sentiment entirely.

Эта игра не просто стратегия, это целая эпоха, в которой каждый выбор может изменить ход истории. 

Плюсы:
1. Сюжет игры, основанный на исторических событиях, позволяет взять на себя роль одного из кланов и вести его к власти. Это не просто борьба за территорию, но и глубокая стратегическая игра, где нужно учитывать политические интриги, дипломатические отношения и экономическое развитие. Каждый выбор имеет значение, и это придает игре особую глубину.
2. Атмосфера Японии периода Сэнгоку передана с невероятной детализацией для игры 2011 года: от красивых пейзажей до неплохо проработанных юнитов, каждый элемент создает ощущение погружения в игру.
3. Музыкальное оформление заслуживает отдельного лайка! Звуки природы, традиционная японская музыка и эпические мелодии во время сражений создают уникальную атмосферу, которая усиливает погружение в игру.
4. Огромный плюс игры в том, что какую-никакую кампанию можно проходить с другом! Это очень круто, весело и дает больше разнообразия для совместных стратегических действий.

Минусы:
1. Иногда искусственный интеллект может показаться не совсем адекватным, а некоторые элементы управления слишком топорные и требуют времени на привыкание. 
2. В некоторых моментах игра может показаться медленной, особенно в начале, когда нужно развивать экономику и строить армию (на что уходит куча времени).

It is essentially an operational and strategic masterpiece, with the AI doing a decent job. The event branches are better than the National Focus system of HOI 4 because they are less prescient and straight-jacketing. I found peace-time to be just as busy  managing tech and economy as the war times.
Units can be given many different types of orders and they make sense. For example, armies can support one another in attack or defense, and even play operational reserve roles.
The Navy and Air Force also, are impact-full in a common-sense way and require planning. They have plenty of orders available. There are also scramble orders for both aircraft and navies.
The game is operationally quite deep.
The tech system and trees are actually interesting.

I'd love to see more provinces and a better depiction of the battle losses, but it is still adequate.
It needs a better supply, espionage and belligerance filter.
There are other UI and informational things which I would like improved.

But overall, it is fun, with just the right amount of micromanagement. | This is a full on Hearts of iron game, just balancing the economy is a complex web of intricacies, the warfare is very fun because its basically you calling in a combined arms offensive against your foes; almost like the real operations that took place in the heat of WW2.

https://github.com/zerk-js/SOTSII-SOS/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta0  

It is obviously, as mentioned elsewhere, not a complete game. What it is however, is basically a repository of interesting ideas about how to make a highly detailed, military-focused 4X-game with AMAZING ship design, interesting technology tree and state management. If you try to see what the game could have been, and is very close to being, you might see the flawed gem that this is.

Is it tedious at times? Yes.
Is it prone to crashing if you are late-game and have seven other players? Yes.
Does it require too many clicks to upgrade space stations? Yes. 

But the ship designer, the differing FTL-systems for each race, the detailed solar-system spanning battles and the ability to completely tailor your ships into an integrated interstellar war machine... it is just intoxicating when you learn to play it. 

Example: How to deal with the fleet-system. 
- Fleets are tasked with missions, instead of just being moved around like Total War-armies.
- A fleet has a ""home base"" (ideally with Naval Stations), and will return after the mission is done.
- The type of mission is decided by ship types (one colony-ship will unlock the ""colonization"" mission)
- This can be changed with the ""relocate""-mission (warning: the system needs enough Command Points: build naval stations for those)

At first this is very tedious, but after a while it feels quite seamless and nice to discover that your light cruiser fleet just finished scouting a system and is ready for another mission, three other scout fleets are in-transit for their targets, while both colonization fleets are busy at work, your battlefleet is 1 turn away from arriving at its target and you see two incoming enemy fleets which you need to respond to in time. 


*Warning: It may cause you to regularly curl up in a fetal position, thinking about how much poorer the failure to complete this came made the 4X-genre... | [b]TL;DR:[/b]
No, I don’t recommend this game. Sword of the Stars 2 is a confusing, overcomplicated mess that feels like the developers tried to reinvent the wheel—and ended up with a triangle.

[b]Sword of the Stars 2: A Real Razor Review[/b]

If you’re here expecting the streamlined fun of the original Sword of the Stars, buckle up, because this sequel takes everything that worked and throws it into a black hole of overcomplicated mechanics. Want to move a fleet? Prepare for a scavenger hunt through obtuse menus and extra steps. Thinking about clicking and dragging to navigate the galaxy map? Forget it. Intuitive controls? Never heard of them.

[b]The Shift from Simplicity to Chaos[/b]
Sword of the Stars 2 turns what should be an engaging 4X space strategy game into a frustrating exercise in patience. Moving a fleet? Here’s your process: Select the fleet (again, even if it’s already selected), sift through a menu of actions with vague names (why is it “relocate” instead of “move”?), confirm your choice, and THEN close the menu. Oh, and don’t forget to click “confirm” again just in case you enjoyed the redundancy.

And navigating the galaxy map? Instead of letting you click and drag like a normal human being, the game opts for a mystery control scheme that even the NSA couldn’t crack. Right-click? Nope. WASD? Wrong again. By the time you figure it out, you’ll have lost interest—or your sanity.

[b]Notifications and Nagging[/b]
Every turn, the game delights in reminding you about “inactive fleets.” Thanks, I know they’re inactive—I left them there on purpose. A simple “Don’t show me this again” checkbox could’ve solved this, but instead, I’m bombarded with pop-ups like it’s Windows 98 trying to update. If the goal was to make me feel punished for leaving fleets idle, mission accomplished.

[b]Menus: Where Immersion Goes to Die[/b]
Sword of the Stars 2 has a menu for everything: fleet manager, planet manager, diplomacy manager, station manager. While variety sounds good on paper, in practice, it’s like navigating the DMV of space games. Nothing flows. There’s no hotkey for escaping menus; instead, you have to click a tiny “close” button every time. Who thought this was a good idea?

Then there’s the encyclopedia. Calling it a mess is generous. It’s a maze of poorly designed tabs and sparse information. Want lore about a species? Tough luck. Expect a single, lazy sentence about their tech with none of the creative depth you’d hope for in a space game. Worse, the menu often breaks, freezing on the wrong screen or refusing to load. Did they even test this?

[b]The Aesthetics - Blurry, Not Beautiful[/b]
While the ships and planets look decent, the background starscapes are a blurry, uninspired mess. Somehow, they managed to make space look bad—a feat I didn’t think was possible. The original game had better visuals in some areas, making this downgrade all the more baffling.

[b]A Design Philosophy Gone Wrong[/b]
It’s clear the developers wanted Sword of the Stars 2 to feel more sci-fi, more futuristic, and more technical. Instead, they overthought everything and left out the fun. Instead of delivering the smooth turn-based flow of a Sid Meier’s Civilization, they created a game so foreign and alien, it’s barely playable. Immersion doesn’t mean burying basic functions under 10 extra steps.

[b]A Broken Legacy[/b]
Surveying planets could’ve been immersive, but instead, it’s tedious. While I appreciate the ambition of including multiple planets per system, the execution feels like a chore. The charm and simplicity of the original game are gone, replaced by an overcomplicated mess of mechanics that don’t work well together.

[b]Real Razor Recommendation?[/b]
No. Sword of the Stars 2 is a massive letdown. Its clunky interface, unintuitive mechanics, and glaring lack of polish make it a painful experience. If you’re nostalgic for the original, steer clear. This sequel breaks everything that made the first game fun and buries it under unnecessary complexity.

1/10. Huge disappointment. Save your money, and shame on the developers for this disaster. | Хотя вторая часть SoTS мне нравится в плане заложенных идей и визуальных улучшений - игру постигла печальная участь. Разработчики, похоже, взяли больше чем способны были откусить, взявшись за капитальную переработку множества механик первой SoTS и не справились, что привело игру к финансовому провалу

Последний патч датирован 2013 годом. На удивление, у меня игра практически не багает и не вылетает вовсе - но в ней остается ощущение недоделанности. Дизайн интерфейса переусложнен, система приказов флоту, как отмечали, сильно сбивает темп игры и вынуждает поломать голову. При этом сохранилась фирменная трехмерная звездная карта, где экспансия может идти во все стороны - ориентироваться в ней стало ещё сложнее. Львиная доля информации об игре находится в PDF-мануале, доступном через предстартовое окно - в то время как, например, в самой игре псионические способности кораблей вообще не имеют описаний, а энциклопедия это довольно жалкий сборник заголовков с парой коротких предложений

Kerberos постарались углубить боевую систему - у кораблей появились модули-модификаторы, есть моделирование брони послойно по всем четырем проекциям. По мере повреждений. отключаются системы и идут потери в экипаже и припасах. Теперь есть три слоя высоты при построении флота, а сами корабли можно вращать по своей оси, чтобы прикрыть наиболее поврежденные участки или сконцентрировать огонь орудий. Звездные системы стали по настоящему системами - боевая карта теперь это огромные просторы с планетами и лунами (ранее одна система была представлена одной планетой, вокруг которой шли бои). Хотя бои стали дольше и немного затянутыми, мне лично нравится

Очень приятно видеть, что фоновая сценарная работа осталась на высоте: игра чувствуется логичным продолжением мира первой игры, - цивилизации изменились, изменились подходы в военном деле (например, эсминцы из самостоятельных кораблей стали носимыми - основной тип кораблей теперь крейсера). Среди адмиралов морриги теперь можно встретить другие расы, а лиир объединились с отступниками-зуулами и теперь, например, пузатые корабли космических дельфинов несут на себе эсминцы и рейдеры самой кровожадной расы игры, используя вовсю преимущества новых союзников. Суул'ка в релизном трейлере просто восхитительны!

И все это читается на фоне - в списке технологий, в дизайне кораблей, в новых функциях типа расширенной дипломатии

Но как самостоятельную игру мне очень сложно её рекомендовать. Лучше попробуйте первую SoTS - крайне самобытную космическую стратегию от разработчиков Homeworld: Cataclysm, с тотальным упором на космические сражения и дизайн кораблей. А ещё у неё прекрасный лор, написанный Эринн Дэмбо | THIS IS A SHAMEFUL DISPLAY!"

Pros:

+ All 12 races have unique tech trees, AI personalities, diplomacy text and more.
+ Chess-engine type dynamic AI that has not been surpassed in any other 4X game and plays by the same rules as you.
+ Truly impactful galactic event system that keeps each game fresh.
+ Lots of different strategies to excel in, from influence, economy, diplomacy to war.
+ Actually really nice soundtrack for a 4X game.
+ Ability to create and download custom races and ship styles. (You can totally set up all Star Trek races).
+ A lot of content after 3 expansions, both in mechanics and in campaigns.
+ Well balanced and bug free after many years of community patches.
+ Runs on any computer and looks alright if you max everything out.

Cons:

- it's a game from 2008, expect some really shitty CGI and a lot of videos and UI elements to look a little low-res on modern resolutions.
- No in-game encyclopedia leaves you looking through the included manual, ""Community Edition Guide"" and old forum threads to figure out the intricacies of gameplay mechanics as the game came out before community game wikis became commonplace. 
- Default ship designs are lacking, you are forced to use the ship builder to make optimized ship designs, this can be a chore and will lead to ugly designs if you can't bother to take the time to artfully place the modules.
- Ship designer does not let you modify the auto-generated designs.
- Suffers from the common ""Space is empty"" curse. No actual terrain, lots of uncolonizable planets and just deep space that is not fun or very distinctive either visually or strategically.
- Compared to stuff like Stellaris, planets are mostly samey as well.
- Civ4 style stacked combat system that does not really care for positioning outside of starbases.

It’s one of those games that’s technically still around (if you bought it back in the day), but good luck finding it if you didn’t—it’s no longer available for purchase on Steam. And that’s a shame because this game was an absolute gateway into Magic: The Gathering, wrapped up in a neat little digital package.

The gameplay was its biggest draw. You weren’t thrown into the deep end with deck-building or forced to buy card packs. Instead, you got preconstructed decks, each with its own flavor and strategy. It was perfect for newcomers who wanted to learn without getting overwhelmed and for veterans who just wanted to sit back and enjoy some streamlined battles.

The campaign gave you a solid progression system, challenging you with AI opponents that represented Magic’s iconic planeswalkers. And let’s not forget those puzzles. They weren’t just “win this match” scenarios; they were bite-sized brain teasers that tested how well you really understood the game’s mechanics. Solving them felt like a mini-victory every time.

Visually, it wasn’t flashy by today’s standards, but it had just enough flair to keep you immersed. The card art was always the star, as it should be. Spell effects were simple but satisfying, and the battlefield layout kept everything clean and easy to follow.

Multiplayer, though—that’s where this game really shined. Archenemy mode was a fan favorite, letting three players team up to take down an overpowered AI opponent. It was a blast, especially with friends. And while the PvP aspect wasn’t as deep as you’d get with physical Magic or something like MTG Arena, it was more than enough to keep things interesting.

Now, speaking of MTG Arena—yes, it’s on Steam now, and it’s great in its own right. But let’s be real: it’s not Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012. Arena is all about competitive ladder climbing and card collecting, while Duels focused on making Magic accessible and fun without the grind. No campaign, no Archenemy, just straight-up one-on-one battles. That’s fine, but it doesn’t scratch the same itch.

If you were lucky enough to buy Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 before it disappeared, you can still download and play it today. And honestly, it holds up. It’s a reminder of a simpler time in digital Magic—a time when you didn’t need a credit card or hours of research to enjoy a game of cards. And yes, I know they had DLC content available to buy content and decks.

So yeah, this game might be off the market, but for those of us who played it, it’s a classic. And for anyone looking for something similar, MTG Arena is worth a look—but don’t expect it to capture the same magic (pun intended)."

76561197974286855,218040,Democracy 2,3.216666666666667,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",0,"Let me start out by saying that I have a degree focusing on Political Science and have worked in the sector....


The Socioeconomic policies do not reflect what happens in the real world, more what someone idealizes how they should work. The Human Element is not well represented, such as in situations where a positive outcome is seen, but the electorate is unhappy due to outlying political/social/etc beliefs (e.g. the goal is accomplished, but not HOW the populace wanted it accomplished, etc). 

The Political system is rather simplified and this makes a Democratic Socialist approach far too easy and ignores key psychological responses that have been observed in the real world when certain situations arise.

After playing for a few hours, using demographic knowledge of game developers, and knowing the political beliefs behind certain policies, I easily beat the game with a Social Democracy....which appears to be the ultimate point of the developers. Comparatively, I attempted a few other forms of government approaches that have been historically stable in the real world, but those forms were not nearly as friendly in the game world.

As this is intended to be a political sim attempting to replicate the real world, I cannot recommend this. 

However, if this were a model that honestly stated its intent to show HOW a Democratic Socialist contruct can best be made and why it is best for them, in their view, as compared to other options...Then I would say that it accomplished its intent. | Overall 5/10

Pros:
- The idea behind it is good, you get to play a government and using different policies you try to get reelected while improving a country.
- Some concepts behind it are solid, both in terms of ecomics and social policies.
- It is easy to understand what each polciy does.

Cons:
- It is probably too easy to beat, just a bunch of algorithms to beat.
- There's only one way to ""win"" and that is pretty much going full ""social democrat"", nothing else seem to work.
- Very few scenarios.
- The consequences of some actions are totally off, like raising VAT to 70% and seeing your opinion rating go up.

I truly like the idea behind it, and I hope the author gets backing to develop it into 1) a real game, made by pros and  2) a more realistic simulation, but as it is now I cannot reccomend it. | Прикольный симулятор демократии.

Такая игра про Первую мировую — поистине жуткая: сидя в окопе, я видел, как моим союзникам отрывали ноги и руки, простреливали насквозь и делали дыры в головах.

Очень запомнился момент, когда мой товарищ по имени танкист попросил меня прийти к нему в окоп за помощью. Прибежав туда, остались лишь изувеченные мертвые тела солдат... На то место сбросили тяжелую артиллерию.
А ещё захватывает брать пулемёт и взбираться на гору с открытым обзором на противника: стреляешь по врагам как в последний раз, ощущение — будто действительно на войне. Очень грустно наблюдать за умирающими солдатами, держащимися за шею или живот; страшно видеть товарища, которому пулей разрывает руку или пронзает шею... Он лежит и кричит в муках несколько минут — зрелище жуткое и одновременно грустное.

Игра впечатляет: такой реалистичный шутер о Первой мировой я ещё не встречал. Даже без живых игроков можно пострелять, наслаждаясь атмосферой. Кстати, лучше играть под музыку — например, слушая ""Свидетельство о смерти"". Это добавляет совершенно новые ощущения. Лучшие вложение на 142 рубля в моей жизни
Ставлю оценку 9/10! | 15年的游戏，可惜16年战地1出了之后由于题材相近但内容贫瘠基本鬼服。之前e宝还免费送过，打折入性价比中规中矩，游戏比较挑人。
目前是9张地图4种模式（能够自定义房间的只有一种模式），玩法相对来说比较乏味，没有可操控载具纯步兵战斗（以4人小队为阵营单位）。一大优点是有bot模式，可以打电脑人，简单难度的游玩体验一般，主要原因是bot行为太过迷惑，敌人能卡位一枪秒玩家，队友连玩家身后都不会掩护，更离谱的是就给小队配装这点时间图上的电脑队友都能把阵地丢了，导致64人推图大战役无论击杀多少敌人都不耽误你输。还有糟糕的地图划区黑枪，防守方出战壕半步都是逃兵警告，缓冲区能不能设置得大一点。
有人可能会吹觉得打不明白或者步枪一枪死就“很真实”，我看来游戏真实性一般，瞄准时准星乱飘还不能屏息，冲锋枪飘得比步枪更厉害，在现实中但凡你碰过真枪都会觉得真不至于，游戏里那手抖得像帕金森一样。步枪躯干一枪死导致玩家和bot近距离对枪容错率很低。换弹动画都是一套，比如鲁格中途换弹肘节枪机就自动抬起至空挂，相比同时代的fps游戏还是比较失真的。最舒心的一点是游戏内容很纯净，没有像BF1那样魔法瞄具自动武器满地跑，武器严格按照年代设定，另外服装考证也很细致，各国进行曲也很用心。
游戏缺乏教程引导（选择阵营和兵种要在进图按esc键我打了好几局才知道），地图卡脚，人物动作略僵硬，虽然糟心的地方有很多，考虑到开发商是一家孜孜不倦更新的小工作室，故给出好评。如果是单纯追求竞技的刺激感的玩家不太建议入。

With informative tutorials, simple navigation, and an in-game 'help' menu, the game play is clear and easy to understand. Graphics look great and work well on my old laptop computer.
If I were to add to the game, I'd ask for further upgrades in materials and buildings. Once a city has been established, the progress can feel stagnant, as if being left without a goal.
Overall, great purchase. I've gotten twenty fulfilling hours out of this game, and I'm only on my first settlement! | Pretty fun and fairly challenging, especially in the beginning of a run. If you are into city builders and sims, it's worth a try.

If your dream is to build a mega city of thousands of citizen, that probably isn't gonna work, however. The game starts to lag considerably approaching high population (600+). This and the lack of endgame buildings and upgrades does limit what you can do as you cannot really expand endlessly.

76561197974286855,239410,Unknown,1.0833333333333333,,1,"Huge fan of Catan, so I thought I'd take a chance on this. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.

Pros:
Visually it looks good, or at least enough for a board game based on Catan.

It handles all the rules for you so you don't have to stop the game and engage in debates. Not that you would with this version anyway (more on that later), and it includes all the scenarios and a map editor (though I haven't tried that yet).

Cons:
Controls are lacking. The map can be squirrelly to navigate. If you're using a touch-screen it's nigh-impossible. When using my Windows 8 touchscreen laptop I kept flying off into some unknown corner of the map and tapping on buttons would cause other buttons to active. The interface isn't very intuitive and it doesn't have pop-up text to help with identification.

Buggy. As others have pointed out, it's buggy and prone to crashing.

No multiplayer. This is probably the biggest negative. It's on Steam. Why not let you play with other players who own the game? I'm guessing they don't want competition to their own multiplayer subscription site, but then why even bother with this version in the first place?

Graphics options. While the graphics look decent, the lack of resolution options is very disappointing.

TL;DR: The game isn't worth the asking price. I picked it up on sale and don't completely regret it simply because I still fire it up every now and then just get a Catan fix when I can't round up a couple more players for the board game, but otherwise this one just sits in my library collecting virtual dust. The biggest disappointment is how close they are. If they fixed the bugs, tweaked the interface, and added multiplayer through Steam, it would instantly be a classic. | HORRIBLE: I love Catan. Probably one of my favorite board games, however, this adaptation of Catan is HORRIBLE! If you love Catan and want to play a digital copy, play it on Xbox Arcade. It alot easier to manuever throughout the game, has speed control, and allows for multiplayer across the internet. This piece of crap only allows multiplayer on the same computer. I never write reviews, so this just goes to show how much this game is worthless. If I could get a refund from any game, this would be it! As well, this game is buggy and crashes alot! | I only played part of the Seafarers campaign.  I would have liked to play more but the constant crashing and scripted dice rolls ruin the game.  The rolls seem to depend on the difficulty selected and how well the player is doing compared to the AI.  It is almost comical how 7's are rolled almost immediately after the player gathers 8, 9, or 10 resources.  That wouldn't be such a big issue if the AI traded competently, but they most certainly do not.

Rather than spending money on this electronic version I recommend you buy the traditional board game version.  Grab some friends and beverages of choice and enjoy what is truly an excellent game and forget about this poorly executed option. | Ca. 9 von 10 Spielen crashen. Das macht das Spiel leider unspielbar. Und dabei ist das Spiel eigentlich gar nicht mal schlecht. Für zwischendurch wäre es eine super Ablenkung. So jedoch ist es leider seinen Preis nicht wert. | Facts:
- Crashes a lot, the current work-around is to save often, the errors that pop up are not FATAL ERRORs, rather its more of an unhandled exception for some idleCursorPosition or something
- Maps are set in stone, they cannot be changed, even though the original board game has randomised maps with randomised resources, e.g. you coud have abundant ore but rare wool
- Online Scenarios means ""Download scenarios that people have made"", it does not mean ""Online Multiplayer""
- The main website is German
- The Catan editor is installed separately from the main program

Opinion:
- Dice rolls seem rigged, in one game the AI rolled six 12s with just 2 die, not sure how you manage that
- Character audio is slow as heck, either you miss the entire conversation or you waste 3 minutes trying to listen to pointless banter

Overall the game represents the board game mechanics quite well, sadly everything else is shockingly bad."

76561197974286855,239820,Game Dev Tycoon,54.13333333333333,"Casual, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",20,"Game Dev Tycoon — это симулятор, где вы делаете игры, чтобы делать деньги, чтобы... делать еще больше игр. Сначала вы работаете в гараже, потом — в роскошном офисе, а между этим изобретаете шедевры вроде «симулятора гонок с элементами РПГ».

Игра радует юмором и ностальгией по эпохам игровой индустрии. Но геймплей быстро превращается в рутину: исследуй, разрабатывай, публикуй. Через пару часов начинаешь ощущать себя настоящим разработчиком — уставшим и в отчаянии.

Оценка: 6,5/10 — неплохое развлечение на вечер, но глубины и разнообразия не хватает. Идеально для тех, кто хочет попробовать, каково это — разрабатывать игры (спойлер: сложно). | Went bankrupt when trying to make Concord like Sony. 100% accurate simulator. | The game is Okey, but lacks depts.
It would have been fun for the game making process to be deep with a lot of complicated variable.
Instead, it feels very generic, to the point were the optimal solution is akin to a formula.
For example, you try to make military game? Action is a good type choice.
Seek a console that makes good Action type games, and allocate your resource acording to the ACTION type games.
Yes... That's right, all action type games are all basically the same, you just need to find an approriate theme and a good work ratio for Graphics, Gameplay, Dialogues, AI, Audio, etc. FOR ALL ACTION TYPE GAMES.
So what if it's a shooter, a platformer, a music bit-mania type game, everything is the same if it's an action type game...
This makes the game overly simplistic, and frankly, a bit lazy in its design.
You shouldn't put all Action games, Strategy games, RPGs, Simulations games, and Adventure games into the same bucket. Shooters and Platformers are both Action games, but they are very different in their nature, and they are likely appreciated in different platforms.
Btw, PCs in this game are not the best for actions games, but in reality, they are the best for First Person Shooters, but not as good for other action games like platformers fighting games.
TLDR: I didn't like the game because it is a bit too generic, lacks real dept, and doesn't make sense in a real world context. |

No game，no life.这绝非虚言。
小初时期在家传的旧电脑上，游玩一些可以带的动相当古早的一些游戏。在二十一世纪的第二个十年，在一系列堪称巅峰级别的大作接连发售时，我却似乎和我的电脑一起被困在了时代里。
妇孺皆知的红色警戒，彼时烂尾的大作命令与征服三发售时，我还在为兵临城下模组着迷；R星的侠盗猎车手V发售的五年后，我还在和汤米维塞迪，卡尔约翰逊一起在前3d世界观中遨游；当CS：GO已经成为现象级游戏，而此时CS1.6的人机还会卡在大仓的隧道里一动不动；至于2016年发行的文明VI六，飞天之梦响彻云霄时，我在北方的那座小城里，听着BabaYet的沙锤声，游玩着2007年发行的文明IV第四代（很巧也是四）以及跃跃欲试但在2016年仍带不动的2013发行的文明V第五代。如果说前款游戏是中国游戏界现象级的存在，而我在这个时代的最末期仍游玩的津津有味。对于文明系列，可以这样说，游戏甚至某种程度上改变了我的人生轨迹。如果我当时没有把心思放在自给自足得到的这些关注人文，关注历史的游戏上，而是去参透什么别的兴趣。也许有可能我就不会学文科，也不会选择现在的专业。
感谢某些无脑盗用游戏画面的游戏小作坊，把自己的游戏用其他游戏界面进行包装，搭便车宣传自己粗制滥造的游戏，但无巧不成书，也让我阴差阳错的知道了Paradox Interactive——一个曾经冷门，现在热度与日俱增甚至一度市值超过育碧的世界级游戏公司——以及属于他的作品们。很可惜和上述所有的游戏一致，我似乎也只“配”玩到极落后版本的游戏——这甚至也是一种奢求。不出意料的，当我尝试运作1.1版本的欧陆风云四时，电脑烧了。
这时是2020年初，拜疫情网课所赐，我终于有了一台自己的笔记本电脑，在通过各种渠道帮助下，从一位网友手中拿到了一份学习版的1.30版本的欧陆风云四。那个夏天，在烈日和暴雨下，以大明为开局，我的游戏生活第二春开始了。
但直到2023年高考结束后，我才在steam上买到正版的EU4，反倒是HOI4 21年就有了正版，那时候小黑盒还是卖兑换码的，现在早就没有了。
直到今天，2025年1月25日，本游戏严格的在线时长突破了一千小时，完成成就190个。这其中有太多的故事可以讲了，用法兰西拿破仑传播共和革命理念，用金雀花王朝重新统合大陆领地成立安茹帝国，从长白山脚下一隅到全中华的大清，从高加索群山中杀出的萨法维波斯，荣耀的哈布斯堡让Aeiou的格言传遍欧洲，摆脱鞑靼枷锁，“为了俄罗斯母亲”的莫斯科大公国，把握土木之变，重返中国的瓦剌，乃至重建蒙古帝国。令人感触最深的定是用拜占庭一隅小国绝境翻盘，重获新生，再造罗马，紫凤翱翔！感谢她给了我一个在现实中编织一个梦的机会，也让我在这个梦中徜徉，流连，不愿醒来也不愿离去。
游戏的意义和人生每件事的意义大抵都相类似，再你经历其中时，拼尽全力的达成那个目标，结束之后回头看，除了享受结果，更感慨唏嘘其过程，这便是寄意寒星荃不察，不负光阴不负心。
希望以后更好，直到时间和世界的尽头。

But honestly it's not an easy game.
You need to watch some videos how other people play it and decide if you want to throw thousands of hours on it. 
I think that it's the easiest grand strategy(not including Knights of Honor which is very simple in comparison) and if you want to start playing grand strategies from Paradox - probably it's you best shot.

Anomaly Korea es una expansión exclusiva del conocido Anomaly: Warzone Earth, un juego de estrategia en tiempo real que le da la vuelta al sistema Tower Defense tradicional, convirtiéndolo en un “Tower Offense”. Nosotros controlaremos un escuadrón de vehículos militares que deberán abrirse paso a través de calles plagadas de estructuras alienígenas. Tras la batalla de Baghdad, las fuerzas enemigas han vuelto más fuertes. En esta ocasión, la misión tendrá lugar en Seúl (Corea del Sur). Deberemos atravesar la ciudad cumpliendo diversas misiones de destrucción de objetivos, escolta o rescate, tratando de buscar la manera de pararle los pies a las fuerzas extraterrestres y expulsarlos de una vez por todas de nuestro planeta.

[h2]Jugabilidad / Apartado técnico[/h2]
El juego mantiene la misma esencia y mecánicas que el original. Dispondremos de 12 misiones de campaña, en las cuales desplegaremos nuestro escuadrón de vehículos, cada uno con una serie de habilidades ofensivas y defensivas. Deberemos recorrer diversos escenarios, eligiendo la ruta que seguirá nuestro convoy de manera eficiente, minimizando daños y destruyendo las torres enemigas. Conforme avancemos iremos recogiendo fondos con los que ampliar nuestro arsenal de vehículos, debiendo posicionarlos dentro del convoy de manera que se protejan los unos a los otros. Volvemos a disponer de un set de 4 habilidades o potenciadores (reparación, señuelo, camuflaje y bombardeo), cuyo uso adecuado será imprescindible para sobrevivir.
Además, el juego incluye 6 misiones especiales, Art of War, que nos harán enfrentarnos a retos especiales. El juego añade muy pocas cosas nuevas con respecto al original: una ligera mejora gráfica, nuevas misiones, un vehículo nuevo (Tanque Horangi) y una nueva torre enemiga (Lanzallamas).

[h2]Valoración[/h2]
Al tratarse de una expansión del original, Anomaly Korea está pensado para aquellos que disfrutaron de Anomaly: Warzone Earth y se quedaron con ganas de más. Básicamente es un juego idéntico, en cuando a mecánicas y estrategia, pero se nota la intención de añadir objetivos más variados y giros inesperados en medio de las misiones, lo que hacen de este título una versión mejorada. Recomiendo probarlo, pues sigue siendo una opción estupenda para los amantes de la estrategia y los juegos de defensa de torres.

76561197974286855,260230,Valiant Hearts: The Great War™ / Soldats Inconnus : Mémoires de la Grande Guerre™,1.45,Adventure,0,"[h1]Valiant Hearts: The Great War[/h1] 
Унікальна гра, яка поєднує елементи пригодницького квесту та головоломки. Ubisoft Montpellier створили витвір, який змушує замислитися над жахами Першої світової війни та долями людей, які в ній опинилися. Гра чудово передає дух часу, пропонуючи незабутню подорож, повну трагедії, надії та людяності.
[h2]Сюжет і персонажі[/h2]
Однією з найбільших сильних сторін Valiant Hearts є її сюжет. Гра розповідає історії чотирьох персонажів: французького фермера Еміля, його німецького зятя Карла, американського добровольця Фредді та бельгійської медсестри Анни. Усі вони переживають війну по-своєму, і їхні шляхи перетинаються в найнеочікуваніші моменти. Їх об’єднує не лише боротьба за виживання, а й дружба, любов і почуття справедливості. Також особливу роль відіграє пес Вальт — відданий чотирилапий друг, який допомагає у важкі моменти. Сюжет розповідається не лише через катсцени, а й через записи персонажів у щоденниках, які допомагають зрозуміти, що переживають персонажі на кожному етапі гри. 
[h2]Геймплей і механіка[/h2]
Гра побудована на простих, але ефективних механіках: гравцеві доводиться розгадувати головоломки, взаємодіяти з об'єктами, тікати від обстрілів, допомагати пораненим і навіть керувати автомобілем під ритм класичної музики. Головоломки не надто складні, але добре вписані у наратив, що робить кожен рівень інтерактивним продовженням історії.
В грі немає традиційного бойової системи. Замість цього доводиться ухилятися, ховатися, а іноді навіть допомагати ворогам вижити. Це ще більше підкреслює антивоєнне послання гри.
[h2]Візуальний стиль і атмосфера[/h2]
Гра виконана у стилі мальованого коміксу, що, на перший погляд, може здатися незвичним для настільки серйозної тематики. Проте цей художній стиль добре реалізований, а контраст між мальованою графікою та жорстокою реальністю війни робить її ще більш емоційно насиченою. Розробники майстерно передали атмосферу Першої світової війни: поля битв з окопами, зруйновані міста, шпиталі та паризькі вулички виглядають переконливо й атмосферно. 
Також в грі є розділ «Історичні факти» в якому зберігаються зібрані факти та предмети, які можна знайти під час проходження. Ці колекційні предмети дозволяють ще глибше зануритися в історичний контекст і відчути весь жах війни.
[h2]Звукове оформлення та музика[/h2]
Музика не просто супроводжує події, а й задає їм тон. Саундтрек чудово поєднує сумні та меланхолійні мелодії з драматичними моментами. Особливо запам’ятовуються композиції, які грають під час сцен переслідувань та важливих сюжетних поворотів.
Звукові ефекти також виконані на високому рівні: гуркіт артилерійських обстрілів, звуки сирен та вибухів ще більше підсилюють відчуття присутності на полі бою.
[h2]Емоційні враження[/h2]
Це не просто гра — це історія, яка залишає слід у серці. На відміну від фільму «На західному фронті без змін»,  ця гра змушує співпереживати кожному персонажу, відчувати їхній біль, страх і надію. Деякі моменти змушують сміятися, інші — викликають сльози.
Фінал гри — це справжній удар по емоціях. Навіть якщо передбачити, до чого все йде, останні хвилини залишають глибокий слід. Valiant Hearts — це не просто розвага, а гра, яка не романтизує війна, а змушує задуматися про історію та людяність.
[h2]Позитивні аспекти[/h2]
✔️ Зворушливий та емоційний сюжет.
✔️ Глибокі персонажі, які запам’ятовуються.
✔️ Унікальний візуальний стиль, що підсилює атмосферу.
✔️ Чудовий саундтрек, що додає драматичності.
✔️ Освітній аспект — гра подає історичні факти у цікавій формі.
✔️ Відсутність традиційної бойової системи, що підкреслює антивоєнний меседж.
[h2]Негативні аспекти[/h2]
❌ Деякі головоломки надто прості та повторюються.
❌ Лінійність — гравець не має особливого впливу на розвиток подій.
❌ Коротка тривалість гри.
[h2]Висновок[/h2]
Valiant Hearts: The Great War — це гра, яку варто пройти кожному. Вона не пропонує вибору між добром і злом, не дає відчути себе героєм, який винищує самотужки сотні ворогів, а навпаки — показує війну такою, якою вона була: жорстокою, безглуздою та руйнівною.
Це один із тих рідкісних проєктів, які поєднують в собі мистецтво, освіту та сильний емоційний вплив. Гра залишає по собі довгий післясмак і змушує задуматися про справжню ціну війни.
 | 伟大的反战作品，无需多言。

由于是十多年前的老游戏了，玩法比较局限，这方面唯一出彩的就是3次汽车追逐战，配合音乐很无厘头，是沉重剧情中为数不多的缓冲。剧情和美术风格是本作最大的亮点，四条故事线相互交织，配合优秀的手绘风格，谱写出惨烈一战中小人物的悲歌。

War makes men mad. 愿世界和平。 | Гру пройшов ще у 23. Сумна історія про чоловіка та його не менш сумну долю. Серце наповнюється жалем, від усвідомлення, що схожі долі мають і наші чоловіки, у зв'язку з війною. Сюжет непоганий, головоломки не сильно складні. Історії персонажів цікаві, і мені подобається, що можна дізнатися цікаві факти про Першу світову війну, враховуючи, що вона є менш популярною, ніж друга. Загальна оцінка - 8/10. До речі у забуті ігри від Юбісофт реєструватися нереально. Якщо вам висвічується реєстрація від якогось U-play, то ось рішення. Зайдіть на сайт Ubisoft Connect або Ubisoft Store, та створіть обліковий запис там. І по ідеї проблема зникне.
P.S. Напевно, це останні роки, коли Юбіки робили чудові ігри.

Если вам кажется, что жизнь — это боль, просто попробуйте Darkest Dungeon. Эта игра покажет, что боль бывает разной: острая, как критический удар босса, тягучая, как бесконечный гринд, и горькая, как осознание, что твоя лучшая команда сошла с ума в первом же походе. 🎭

[h2]Визуал, ощущение и звук — атмосферно как похоронный марш 🎻⚰️[/h2]
Готическая рисовка, гипнотический саундтрек и диктор, чей голос мог бы зачитывать эпитафию, создают невероятную атмосферу. Смотреть на игру приятно, слушать — тоже, но вот играть… Это уже отдельный вопрос.
[b]Геймплей — „ещё один заход, и спать“ (ложь!) [/b]🔄😵

[h2]Игра — бесконечный цикл страданий:[/h2]
❗️Собрал героев (учёл их страхи, фобии и дурные привычки).
❗️Снарядил их (понял, что денег мало, продал ненужные тринкеты, теперь их не хватает на лечение).
❗️Отправил в поход (один герой впал в безумие, второй едва пережил два смертельных удара, третий просто умер).
❗️Вернулся в город (игровой зал ограблен, лечиться негде, нервный тик у игрока усиливается).
❗️Повторил всё снова (а мог бы заняться чем-то полезным, но нет).

[h2]„Рандом“ и баланс — где правда? 🎲[/h2]
Одни говорят: «всё зависит от удачи», другие — «опытный игрок контролирует хаос». Истина где-то посередине. Когда ты промазал, враг уклонился, а потом вмазал тебе критом — это „игровая механика“. Когда ты сделал то же самое — „баланс“.

[h2]Затягивает? Да. Бесит? О, да! 💀[/h2]
[b]Игра — наркотик:[/b] сложный, затягивающий, временами несправедливый, но невероятно проработанный. Кто-то бросает её на середине из-за монотонности, кто-то зачищает карту до последнего босса, а кто-то сидит уже 50 часов и не может остановиться.

[b]Вывод:[/b] если у вас крепкие нервы и много свободного времени — вперёд, в мрак. Но если вам дорога ваша психика… ну, вас предупреждали. 😈🎮 | this game makes me geniunely fucking stressed i cant reccomend it to any normal person, i feel that if i made my grandma play this game she'd die of cardiac arrest

but its like an abusive relationship i jjuust keep wanting more, yes one more dd1 run, just one more yeah dude yeah yeaha just onee more broooo just one moreeee fuckk my life FUCKKK WHY ARE YOU MISSING, STOP MISSING YOU PIECE OF SHIT LEPER FUCKING HIT THAT BITCH ALREADY | É de fato um jogo intrigante. Você passa um bom tempo jogando como se ele fosse um jogo qualquer, quando na verdade o rumo que se deve ter é completamente diferente. Darkest Dungeon é uma das minhas experiências mais difíceis que eu tive nos últimos anos com jogos. A jogabilidade é extremamente punitiva, nociva caso não saiba o que está fazendo. Um dos núcleos do jogo, é o dinheiro. É necessário entrar nas missões (dungeons), se importar com fazer dinheiro, sua sobrevivência e ainda completar o seu objetivo. Conciliar todos esses fatores, transforma a experiência em um ciclo maçante de fazer dinheiro e upar personagens para o final do jogo. Penso que essa ferramenta utilizada para ser a ponte principal do Darkest Dungeon, pode ser bem mal vista para quem pensa em zerar o jogo.

Mas, além de tudo, gostaria de enaltecer a arte característica e virtuosa, que transmite perfeitamente a atmosfera obscura das dungeons, da sofrência e do medo. A direção artística voltada ao tema ""Lovecrafteana"", é muito bem feito, principalmente no que se diz progressão visual. Os ambientes se tornando mais medonhas cada vez que você vai progredindo para o final do jogo, a mudança de cores voltadas ao cosmo e carnificina ou até mesmo as músicas que passam de um violino arranhado e agitado para algo mais ""contemplador""

Por fim, vai minha dica:
- Se você quiser uma experiência menos massiva, jogue na dificuldade Radiante
- Caso queira sofrer um pouco mais, tendo que repetir missões para ficar mais forte, jogue na Mais Escura
- E se você for um mutante, jogue na mais difícil mesmo, é uma experiência semelhante a estar em um quarto branco com camisa de força no corpo | 新手上手不难，甚至比月计还简单一些，风格也熟悉，各位主管，司书，管理员必入 | This is a game I played on an off for years, and both loved it and grew frustrated by it as I played.  This last year I decided it was time to beat the game finally, so I dedicated a bit more of my gaming time to it, and feel I can give some fairly informed thoughts on the game.  

Darkest Dungeon has a fun party management system that is well designed and the heart and soul of the game.  Do you select your ranged skills for your Highwayman so he can be in position 3?  Or do you take his pos 1/2 skills and play more of a high risk high reward style of play up front?  Do you put your jester in the back making him a buffing character?  Or do you put him further forward so you can apply bleed and be more of a DPS character?  It allows you to make a lot of different parties in different ways, and as you play you learn what combo's works best for each situation, and which ones you prefer to play.  

The enemies also have positions that work differently for each enemy type, and some of your characters will let you manipulate the positions of your enemies to mess them up or put them in a position for one of your other characters to pummel them into the dirt.   So overall the game play is EXCELLENT.

Where I had my struggles with the game was losing characters.  When I first started playing the game it really hurt to lose that Leper that I had been using effectively for so many dives into the dungeon.  I eventually learned that dying is an important aspect of the game, and if you upgrade your stagecoach you will be just fine.  The death of the characters also adds weight to your decisions in the game.  If you decide to get too crazy with a party/skill composition there is a very real chance you are going to lose some of your characters.  So if you decide to play Darkest dungeon just accept right off the bat that death is part of the grim dark theme of the game.

The other aspect of the game that people may not like is the tone and atmosphere of the game.  It is a grim dark themed horror game.  Horror is not really my jam to be honest, but the game play and how the theme is executed, and the great narration of the game drew me in despite my lack of interest in the horror genre.  

Overall the game play is excellent, and the setting, style and art of the game is unique and intriguing.  I would highly recommend this to people looking for a great rogue like dungeon crawler that stands out in an over crowded market."

  总而言之还是非常推荐的一款好游戏（个人感觉打mod情况下称之为神作不为过）。 | Made some good memories with this game. I highly recommend to do the first playthroughs without mods, but downloading one or two is absolutely inevitable beacuse of the lack of content towards endgame. The game is super easy, the main quest  only takes bout 2 focused hours maximum. I like the idea of a fully playable universe but there is just not enough content to fill it. It had a lot of wasted potential, and thats why im sure that every copy of this game becomes a modded mess after the first 100 hours or so | Что же, как 500+ часов игрок в террарию могу сказать что после прохождения этой игры (основного сюжета) смешанные чувства. Если сравнивать эту игру с террарией то эта мне показалась какой-то захламленной что-ли, если в терке почти каждый предмет имел какую-то ценность то тут по большей части один хлам с которым не знаешь что делать, даже многие оружия сразу же как ты их находишь,вне зависимости от того на каком ты уровне прокачки, это бесполезный хлам. Очень странно сделана система продвижения то есть не понятно как игра понимает когда тебе должна попасться крутая вещь, а когда ещё рано, если в террарии это происходило после убийства боссов/получения новой руды то тут тебе чисто может повезти выбить с сундука крутой меч или нет (только с одного босса даётся нормальное оружие). Также многие станции для крафта попросту не применяются больше половины игры, мне наковальня понадобилась лишь для улучшения наспинного балона или что это. Скорее всего половину классных оружий можно пропустить если не пронюхювать каждый уголок планеты ведь в наковальне ты сможешь скрафтить максимум слабенький пистолет для начала игры. Продвижение в сюжете какое-то не очень, нет сам сюжет нормальный но выискивать в галактике поселения разных рас это утомляет ведь они не с 100% вероятностью спавнятся на указанных планетах. Вообщем игра неплохая но я бы не рекомендовала под видом ""для любителей террарии"". Единственное чем точно это может быть лучше это возможности в билдинге, тут реально можно настроить красивых вещей | not a terraria clone at all. i was thinking like that at first too but it's really not even close. it sets itself to be so different and unique, it is literally a whole nother game, and it's so peak too. | Bon jeu mais sans plus, on s'y perd vite dans la diversité.
Rentable si le côté bac à sable et 2D pixel-art plaît. La BO est super :)

Abandonné et inachevé par les devs, la fin de jeu est décevante mais avec des amis offre un super terrain pour construire de joli univers.

穿过公路要看左右公路两侧方向，确认路面情况，不要在公路中间呆留太久，不然可能会有一辆车疾驶而过将某个倒霉蛋创飞

听到破坏者的大笑声、建筑师愉快的说话声后的木星炮开火声、阿尔戈开火的轰鸣声、激光炮的开火声，立刻往回跑或其他逃跑方向，远离前线和周围的队友（这个指敌人用电台的火力支援打击）
要分辨出我方和敌方电台远程火力打击的炮火声，这个多听就知道了，反正我能一下子分辨出来，还有呼叫了电台火力打击后（包含技能）死亡，别立刻按重新布置，因为有友伤，而且不会TK（我之前用板材小号玩板甲刽子手的时候被MG4mod3的技能无人机扫射刮死过一次）

最好记住敌人载具的开火声，然后判断开火方向，确认大致位置（除了下载了载具圈插件），查看周围掩体情况，这样来判断自己是否现在过去，还是等会过去炸载具挣RP（游戏币）

遇事不决，呼叫电台增援、火力打击是最好的选择，但是要是在CD冷却，或战术点不足。为了小命，那就撤退，从长计议吧。这叫向后前进。就算这局输了，命还在就行（刷KD奴的想法）

对枪的时候要横向走位毕竟AI不会预判枪，即使穿龟甲，只要移速不是太慢都可行，这样有概率躲开大部分攻击

还有不要傻傻的顶着顶着载具、近防炮正面火力送人头。要学会从射击死角绕后接近贴C4或其他反载具武器，要接近敌阵之前要看是否安全，不然一上去就凉凉了，没有游戏体验。

Bom, esta é a primeira vez que jogo um Sid Meier. E tenho que admitir que, contra minhas expectativas, fui positivamente surpreendido.
Além de seguir acontecimentos reais, o jogo oferece várias possibilidades e estratégias. Além do mais, mesmo sendo totalmente leigo, como é meu caso, ele é bastante intuitivo, mesmo se depois leva tempo para dominar.
Ao mesmo que oferece diversão, oferece desafios para todos os gostos.
Da próxima vez darei mais bola para um jogo da franquia.

76561197974286855,295270,Unknown,208.1,,30,"Football Manager is not a game. Until you have loaded Football Manager up, you will not have discovered the wonders that lay inside. You start about 9:00AM in the morning, you think ""I'll just play a few hours then go get something to eat"". Before you know it, the year's 2022 and your new youth prospect David Moores has scored a hattrick against Manchester United. Real Madrid are bidding £40,000,000 for him, but the lad's been with you since he was 16, you discovered him in the depths of the Crewe academy, and you don't want to let him go. But the brat wants a new challenge, he's telling you that if he doesn't go he's going to start making the dressing room negative. Then it happens, you wake up, you realise that it was just a dream, David is happy to stay at the club. Football manager is not a game, it's a part of your life. | O jogo está muito bom, aconselho a vocês procurarem na internet skins com as faces de todos os jogadores, técnicos, dos auxiliares técnicos e etcs (o que eu baixei tinha quase 7 gigas) e também das ligas e escudos originais de cada time (o que baixei pesava 1,2 gigas), o jogo se transforma em outra coisa, é diversão garantida pra quem curte manager, pra mim 10/10. | ive bought this game for many years and think this might be my last. firstly im not keen on spending £30 a year on something that could be released as an update. the lack of competition in the manager genre has made SI very lazy, to the point where they make one or two small changes and market it as a new game. here are some of the points where my problems lie

-ridiculous injurys, in my first season there was not one point where i didnt have at least six players injured

-how many times in real football does a team make all its subs then a player gets injured and they finish the game with 10 men? well in FM about one in three games but amazingly never to the computer opponent

-its almost impossible to generate any momentum anymore in FM, you will be playing well then suddenly lose for no reason

-football has always been in the headlines for footballers astronomical wages, thank god its not like FM, youth players who have never made a first team appearance asking for 40k! agents of average players asking for 5mill in fees!

-instead of improving things like the ability to see how your players have performed in training during the week to help your decisions on who to play SI add 'tunnel interviews'?!? i can imagine the meeting at SI 'so what have the fans on the forums been asking for'
'well their all desperate for more press interviews in the game, they just dont feel theres enough'

as fans of the series we should treat SI like an alchoholic relative and not hand over money to them to continue their bad habits, in this case their bad habits being treating fans like cash-cows that they can just make sub-standard games for and rely on fan loyalty | I have played every iteration of the Football Manager series, long before I even used Steam and I have to say that Football Manager 2015 has some of the most glaring issues I have seen within the series.

Manager customization has been inserted and is a step in the right direction, but not entirely.  So, you will get to ""customize"" the stats of your manager.  Are you more laid back or more technical?  The option to customize and edit stats as such as adaptability and understand of things like attacking, defensive, etc are there.  However, i don't entirely know what impact they have on the game as In my 9 hours of playing I haven't really noticed it or came across them again.  I also do not know if these stats improve or worsen over time, depending on what you do - as the game does not tell you, even in the very brief tutorials.

The new user interface layout is amazing and is long overdue.  I actually found that I stopped playing Football Manager 2014 because of the UI.  It was clunky, it was a mess and I had no idea where anything was.  It was all just text and drop down menu's. Now there is a nice sidebar which provides links that take you to the most important and most used parts of the game as such as tactics, scouting, team, etc.

Purchasing players is odd this year.  Sometimes it is extremely easy to buy a player and others extremely difficult, for no reason - even if you are trying to purchase an already transfer listed player or a reserve player getting no games at his current club.  The old ""Let me pay £100m on a 48 month deal"" STILL works. You can buy any player that wants to come to your club if you use this method and it totally breaks the entire game. 

My biggest gripe and the sole reason why I need to give a bad recommendation to this game:  The AI and the match engine.  The AI in Football Manager 2015 is the worst I have ever seen in the series. If you actually sit and watch the match unfold you will see some of the following:

- Players running for a ball and stopping for no reason
- The goalkeeper saving the ball, standing back and staring at the ball, which is touching his feet
- A Player will chase the ball down the wing at full speed, slow down and allow a opposing team player to catch up and take the ball.
- Opposing team player has the ball and stands still.  All of your players are polite enough to let him stand still.
- Outrages tackles: Ball is moving out of your box, opposing striker is running out of your box.  There is no threat. Defender will slide tackle him as he is leaving the box and give away a penalty.
- CB's that seem to play as strikers, leaving entire gaps in your defence.

Red cards, injuries and own goals - EVERYWHERE.  I have not went through a game yet where there has not been at least one own goal either by my team or the opposing team.  They are everywhere. Red cards and injuries happen in abundance - I have had 10 players injured within the first month of a season even though I had average training and not too many games in quick succession.

Tactics do not work as they are intended.  If you sit down and take the time to read and learn how to create tactics, you will be so frustrated.  The game gives you descriptions of what each position and instruction does, in depth.  This is great. However, they do not work as they say.  Short passing, retaining position and not punting the ball up the park?  Team constantly just fires the ball all over the park with next to no short passing. Push higher up the park?  Team sits deep. 

Because of these issues, scorelines can be ridiculous.  In my first 5 games of the season there was a combined number of 30 goals between me and the other team.  My first game finished 5-4 and my second was 6-3.

This all leads to a very frustrating experience overall.  Every year SI always say ""we are improving the match engine"".  Where are these improvements?  I have not seen any improvements, just more bugs and terrible AI. I love this series and I am a huge football fan, but I feel obliged to tell fellow consumers not to purchase this product until it vastly improves.

このFMシリーズは、サッカーが好きで、特に海外サッカーに興味がある方。
また、サッカーで自分ならこの選手を起用するのに！とか、
ここで交代のカードはこいつだろ！なんて思った事がある方にはオススメ出来るゲームです！

本シリーズは、日本語未対応ですが、有志の方のＭＯＤにより、毎作、ほぼ完璧に翻訳がなされています。
やり方は簡単。毎作、とても素晴らしい和訳ですので、英語に自信のある方以外は、日本語化をされた方が良いと思います。
（※6/4日本語化ＭＯＤも翻訳が完了したようです。毎年、本当に感謝感謝です。）
あと、その他のＭＯＤ、スキンやフェイスパック、ロゴ、Ｋｉｔ、サウンドパック、バックグラウンド、アドボード等など…
これらもＤＬや導入には時間がかかるのですが、導入した方が絶対満足度は高いと思いますので
頑張って入れてみてください。

グラフィックについては、2014より、より良くなっていると思います。
ただ、ここはＦＩＦＡシリーズなんかに比べると圧倒的に弱いです（笑）　初めてやる方は過度に期待しないでください。

音楽もありません。試合中にワーワー言うだけです。
ＭＯＤのサウンドパックを入れるか、慣れると歓声を聞くのも飽きてきますので、
好きな音楽を聴きながらやるのが良いと思います。

演出なんかも特になく、わりとユーザーを突き放した感じの作りです。
データ量もはんぱじゃないので、まずは何をすればいいのかしら…と途方にくれちゃうかもしれませんね。
そんな時は、ユーザーのプレイ日記ブログや、ＦＭの情報サイトを漁って、感じをつかむのが上達のコツだと思います。

そんな感じで、決してとっつきやすいゲームとは言えない本シリーズですが、
サッカー好きなら、そんな事も気にならないくらいドはまり出来るはず!
ぜひ、フットボールマネージャーで、職業：サッカー監督な生活を始めてみてください！


最後に、情報共有のため、最終パッチで発生したエラーについて補足

こちらでご報告していた、試合中の選手や観客の動作が止まってしまうバグは
ドキュメント内のTacticsフォルダに入っている、戦術のファイルを消す（移動させる）事で直ると
SIのフォーラムにて3/13付で報告があり、私の環境でもその対処で正常に動作しました。
同時に、戦術を弄った時に起こるクラッシュや、Skin等の表示がおかしくなる現象もなくなり
私の環境下では、ほぼトラブルは解消されたようです。

（※ファイル消した後に、試しに3つほど戦術のファイルを作成して保存してみましたが、
特に問題なく動作していますので、いったん直ってしまえば、新たにファイルを保存しても
ゲームのプレイに問題はないようです。
ただ、フォーラムの中にやはり試合中の3Dアニメに関するバグでに関する回答で
Tacticsフォルダの中にいっぱいファイルが入ってない？みたいなのがありましたので、
大量に保存すると、またエラーが出る可能性もあるのかもしれませんが…こちらは未確認です。
その際は、やはり戦術ファイルを消せば恐らく直るんじゃないかと…。）

あと、途中のパッチまでであったセーブ時間の長さの問題は、実測20秒前後に落ち着いて解消。
ゲームのクラッシュはまだ残っているようですが、あまり気にしなくていいかな？程度。
特定のメールや画面を閲覧した時に起こるクラッシュは、
キャッシュクリアをしてやれば防ぐ事が出来る様子。
試合後やメールを大量に読んだ後に、キャッシュクリアを一旦やればほぼ避けられるようです。

あと、シリーズを通して”ある時期に来るとゲームが進まなくなるトラブル”があるのですが、
今作でも最初の頃のパッチで一度そういう事がありました。
その際は、休暇を使ってトラブルが起こる時期をやり過ごす方法と、
他の人が同じような状況で解決した方法として、ゲーム設定→インターフェイスの
レンダリングモードをGPUアシストから、ソフトウェアに変更するやり方もあるようです。

似たような状況になった際はお試しください。"

Do it. 

This game is an improved version of the original flash games, with a unique, old flash-game style I really adore honestly. 
The gameplay is often micromanagement, but I find it fun. This game was a worthwhile investment. | if you played previous 2 rebuild games this game is for you system requirements not so steep and i already finished the 1st city on story mode and 1 city in quick play on normal | I remember playing the two original rebuilds on a browser using flash when i was a child, and was very excited to finally play the final one on steam. It's rather enjoyable and I Definitely got my moneys worth, although there are a few things that make me not want to play it again.

The fact it isn't turn based makes it a bit more tedious than the two original ones as you must constantly pause in order to give them new missions, along with how you must position your defenders instead of them all counting towards a defence total. Also, the requirement to ally or eliminate all other factions to win a map makes it so that you need to tediously spam donations a few dozen times before you can move on to the next. Otherwise, it's still rather fun, and a nice finale to the series. | Best game ever made. This game is so awesome ><. So simple but so awesome. She made it so you can make mods for it. I'm going to have to start playing with that. There is even a workshop tab in steam with some mods. | Kesinlikle eğlenceli. Öncesinde 2. oyunu oynayarak temel sürece hakim olmanızı öneririm.

Очень любил эту игру до того,как разработчики испортили её.Раньше все старались построить хорошие машины,выбрать те оружия,которые им по душе.Были Тиры,и каждый Тир был сбалансирован,не было через чур(были,но немного) сильный противников.Было Древо улучшений.А сейчас - разнацветные кубики,пыль,кейсы,игроки строят коробки на одной ножке или коробки с ротором и цепляют на него самые имбалансные пушки,которые выпали из купленных кейсов.Подбор противников просто ужасен.Игру облегчили для максимума(чтобы любой идиот,у которого есть деньги мог играть в это и донатить как можно больше) и превратили в помойку.Раньше было намного лучше.Разработчикам важен только донат,а не сама игра. | Uwaga! Opis mechanik gry jest już przestarzały(wyjaśnienie na końcu);

Dobry przykład jak ze świetnej gry zrobić totalnego gniota bez balansu nastawionego na grind i mikrotranzakcje wymuszające kupno premium by mieć jakąkolwiek szansę normalnego rozwoju konta. Gra kilka lat temu była świetna, przyjemny rozwój robotów, przyjemne walki, gra była nastawiona na umiejętności budowy robotów, co było bardzo ważną umiejętnością, a walka polegała na starannym niszczeniu najsłabszych punktów przeciwnika. Było trochę problemów z balansem, ale twórcy kompletnie nie potrafili ich naprawić mimo tego, że gracze pisali wielokrotnie co trzeba zmienić.

Twórcy wszystkie problemy zaczęli ""rozwiązywać"" od najgorszej strony, tworząc przy okazji nowe problemy. Z czasem gra straciła jakikolwiek sens posiadania umiejętności budowy, ponieważ teraz często liczy się kto pierwszy zaatakuje, a nie skill. Tutaj już nawet nie trzeba budować, twórcy dali możliwość kupowania robotów innych graczy, przez co nie ma sensu się starać, lepiej kupić potężnego bota aktualnej mety, po co budować, skoro wszystko i tak będzie gorsze? Tu też przychodzi drugi problem, balans. Zawsze był z tym problem, lecz kiedyś nie aż tak duży. Jak zwykle twórcy nie potrafią rozwiązywać problemów, przez to w grze jest pewna tzw. ""meta"", czyli najskuteczniejsze boty w grze. Przez idotyczne decyzje twórców ta liczba w tej chwili wynosi bodajże 3(tak, 3 typy robotów są skutecznie na wyższym poziomie umiejętności, reszta to strata nerwów i przegrywanie). Mobilność bota jest wszystkim ponieważ nawet najtwardsze boty topnieją w chwilę, więc nie ma sensu budować niczego innego. Chcesz pobawić się tworząc ładnie wyglądającego bota? Zapomnij, chyba, że nie masz nic przeciwko przegrywaniu 3/4 gier. Twórcy nie potrafią rozwiązać jakichkolwiek problemów z balansem. Do tego doszedł system skrzynek, który polega po prostu na tym, że gigantycznie zmniejszył średnią zdobywaną kasę za bitwę oraz zachęca do kupowania premium w postaci ""patrz, super rzadki item, kup premium to go dostaniesz!"". Bitwa za bitwą a zbudować to, co przedtem mogliśmy po ~30 bitwach teraz musimy zagrać ich ~200. Chyba, że ma się farta i się wydropi legendarny przedmiot. Ewentualnie gra pokaże go w slocie premium i będzie chciała zachęcić do jego kupna. Recykling bezużytecznych itemów na kasę w grze daje idiotycznie małe wartosci, prawie nic, gracze domagali się podniesienia wartości recyklingu, po wielu miesiącach, twórcy w końcu zrobili to, ale tylko, kiedy ma się premium(!), powodując, że teraz premium nie tylko dwukrotnie zwiększa ilośc itemów ze skrzynek, to teraz trzykrotnie zwiększa wartość recyklingu każdego itema. p2w tego nie można do końca nazwać, ale definitywnie jest to PayWall. Aktualne premium powoduje, że otrzymamy tyle, ile przed updatem zanim zmniejszyli nagrody za bitwy. Grając za darmo otrzymujemy 6x mniej. Powodzenia zbudować bota z ulubionym wyposażeniem. Gra bez premium to katorga, W dodatku gra jest wieczną alfą, co służy tylko temu, by twórcy mogli sobie dowoli zmieniać so chcą, np. jeszcze bardziej zwiększając rolę mikropłatności w grze. W rzeczywistości gra jest w gorszym stanie niż 2,5 lat temu. Kilka miesięcy temu było baardzo źle i weterani uciekali od tego szajsu. Teraz jest jeszcze gorzej.

Podsumowując: Stuprocentowy negatyw.

@edit 24.05.2019 r.
Sporo się zmieniło, nie ma już lootboxów, powrócili (nieudolnie) do tierów oraz drzewka technologii. Gra jest nadal masakryczna. Fizyka skopana, najlepsze roboty to pojedyncza broń T5 na lekkim i szybkim(najlepiej latającym) bocie. ""Connecting To Server"" wszędzie, a w dodatku by zniwelować ubytek graczy nie można już wybrać trybu gry z rotacją co godzinę. Tak. Ta sama mapa, ten sam tryb, te same ustawienia PRZEZ GODZINĘ. Dodali ulepszanie broni(by zadawały jeszcze więcej DMG!), więc TTK jeszcze bardziej zmniejszyli(za czasów Overclockingu ludzie nienawidzili buffowania DMG, widać twórcy nic się nie nauczyli). Robopassy dające jakieś kiepskie kosmetyczne przedmioty by trochę kasy wyciągnąć z umierającej gry.
Od Grudnia 2018 r. stracili połowę istniejących graczy. Jak to zrobili? Pośrednio twórcy w końcu zobaczyli, że Robocraft z początków był lepszy, więc próbują wprowadzać rzeczy i mechanikę, która była w tamtym czasie. Problem jest taki, że po pierwsze robią to nieumiejętnie, po drugie, że nadal próbują swoje ""nowości"". Na końcu otrzymujemy dziadostwo, w które nie da się grać. W tą grę gra mniej ludzi niż w Spore. I pomyśleć, że Robocraft ze swoją unikalną receptą na grę posiadał ponad 7 tysięcy aktywnych graczy.

Jakiś czas temu wyszli z Early Access, a przynajmniej zrobili to teoretycznie, bo gra nadal się zmieniała drastycznie. W sumie gra jest w gorszym stanie niż w czasie wczesnego EA.

@Edit, 14.07.2019.
No i stało się. Robocraft upadł. Freejam zwalnia ludzi bo mają mało kasy, przyznali się, że Robocraft po opłaceniu serwerów wychodzi na minus. Wszystkie zasoby idą na RobocraftX(tworzenie gry od początku). Będą utrzymywać serwery tak długo jak to będzie możliwe i naprawiać większe bugi. Kilka lat ludzie pisali co jest źle z grą, mówili jakie błędy popełniają twórcy, wszystko dostali na tacy, twórcy mieli to gdzieś i dalej rozwalali grę po swoją tajemniczą ""wizję"", która się zmieniała co update dalej rozwalając grę dziwnymi rozwiązaniami, o które nikt nie prosił. To się nie mogło inaczej skończyć Radzę nie wydawać nawet grosza na tą grę, bo pieniądze mogą przepaść. | Encontre este juego hace unos años atras. Encontre un potencial exito indie multiplayer, como por ejemplo lo que hoydia es Rocket League.
Me enamore de sus mecanicas, y del desarrollo que Freejam de entregaba a su juego, sin duda yo me alegre bastante cuando Robocraft gano el Indie del Año por parte de IndieDB.

Era esos dias en donde era una Arena 10vs10, donde llegar a Tier 10 te hacia en uno de los mejores del juego. En donde tenias que ser consistente para ir desbloqueando todas las mejoras del arbol de tecnologias. En donde la sinergia del jugador y su maquina, y lo mas importante y lo que actualmente se perdio: completo trabajo en equipo. Y quien llevaba a nivel 100 era considerado un Dios.

Donde la habilidad era para saber construir el mejor vehiculo, en todos los ambitos posibles. En donde se copiaban diseños pero aun asi quedaban con un toque personal.

Esos dias. Antes de las torres. Antes de los Megabots. Antes de los medicos.
Cuando solo habian 3 clases. Y aun asi digo que la inclusion de los medicos dio un giro muy positivo al juego.

Donde TODOS. Iban en una fila por una de las 2 lineas principales del mapa. Y en donde se producia un 50/50 en donde podia quedar la absoluta mie*da en una batalla de 10vs10 frente a frente. Y en donde el equipo contrario llegaria a su base y el equipo de dividia para ir a defender la base.

Updates pasaban y no habia tanto cambio. Incluso la inclusion de las torres era una idea fantastica, y todo el mundo en los foros dio su apoyo. Pero simplemente y en mera opinion mia, no fue ejecutada de manera efectiva, o sonaba mejor en papel. Aun asi el juego era bastante bueno en esos momentos y todavia se apreciaba ese espiritu competitivo. Lo que realmente afecto al juego fue el sistema de respawn. Antes la gente hacia cosas imposibles para sobrevivir. O intentar capturar la base enemiga. Con el respawn vi morir frente a mi todo eso.

Hasta que 2 mecanicas nuevas mataron mi idea original del juego.
Las cajas y el nuevo sistema de ""dinero"".

This was one of my favorite games back in 2014. It had everything you could ask for: balancing, a good community, active and attentive devs, weapons that complemented each other, fun gameplay, good progression, lack of ""pay2win"" and so forth. Needless to say, it was awesome.

Then the January 2015 update was released.

The January 2015 update added a new gamemode where you destroy towers, levelled up, and respawn if destroyed. Initially, me and the rest of the community thought ""Cool."" and waited to see what else was in store. Little did I know that the downfall of Robocraft had begun.

(Order not completely accurate)

""Megabots"" (gigantic robots basically) were removed as soon as the update came out, if not before.

Crates were introduced (partially replacing the robits system), level based CPU limits eliminated, and the tech tree removed, eliminating progression, reducing creativity, and generally made the game much worse. Despite the huge outcry and the veterans and other players who started to leave the game, the devs simply ignored the community and moved on.

Helicopter blades were added, enabling people to make flying fortresses (maybe literrally). Personally I don't think much of this.

Then weapons, most notably an anti-air cannon and a minigun, were added, making weapons unbalanced and the game more frustrating to play. As a pilot in Robocraft (a more ""traditional"" one who used plasma bombers), this particulary saddened and angered me.

A robot shop was added, further reducing creativity.

An intro was added into the game, giving the game a more ""cheezy"" feel and making it seem as if the developers were copying other games. By this point, I personally felt that the developers were catering more toward children (12 year olds) and no longer valued older players and veterans.

All this time, veterans and other older players were leaving the game as it became increasingly apparent that the developers were not listening to the community. 

A new chat system was added, featuring a clan system that the community had been asking for for a long time. This was not nearly enough however, as the other changes above (as well as others) and the careless developers made the game unenjoyable for me (and potentially other older players, although I can not speak for them on this matter).

I finally left Robocraft for good in mid 2015 (shortly after the new chat system was introduced) after a brief stint operating a hovercraft with SMGs.

In it's current state, Robocraft is unbalanced and unenjoyable. The developers are careless and possibly largely inactive (aside from bugfixes and tweaks). Gameplay is frustrating, gamemodes horrible. 

As another reviewer (spynathan) has said: ""From Robocraft to Robocrap.""

If, somehow, all (and I mean all) changes to the game were reverted back to sometime before the January 2015 update, say, November 2014, me and other members of the community (read their reviews to see what they have to say) who have left Robocraft may very well return.

Until then, goodbye Robocraft. | 看我的游戏时间就知道了。这确实是一个好游戏，我还买了永久会员，但他现在确实让我失望了。我也是从T级时代走过来的人，RC的变化我也历历在目。不过现在，FJ的小霸王服务器，将游戏改的一塌糊涂，各种毒瘤载具对新手的压制，虽然出了简体中文，玩家也更多了，但为什么RC的评价在从好评如潮下滑到褒贬不一呢？我们应该思考，FJ更应该思考。"
76561197974286855,303800,The Witcher Adventure Game,3.716666666666667,"Adventure, Strategy",1,"This is a good realization of the board game. It is playable as hot-seat or online and may give you many hours of enjoyable experience.

But there are some flaws that need to be fixed to make the game perfect:

1. When a player have to do a choice, he/she can't access to the game map and/or any player hero sheet and resources including his/her own. This may easily lead to wrong decisions and waste fun. The board game is obviously free from this limitation. So, the possibility to ""minimize"" the choice and take look at the game state will make the game much comfortable.

2. Some choices are not clearly described. For example, Triss Merigold has a spell to look at the two top investigation cards then put one on the bottom of the deck and the other back on top. When this spell is used, the game show two cards and say to the player just ""choose one of them"". What will be happen next with the chosen card is unclear.

3. The rules of the game says that proofs can't be exchanged back to leads. So, the investigation successes of a hero converted to proofs must me ""protected"" from any bad events that force the hero to spend leads. But in the computer version proofs ARE exchanged back to leads every time a hero must spend more leads than he/she have.

4. The AI is wery weak, so the single-player games are dull and not enjoyable at all.

5. There is no russian language, sadly to many and many russian-speaking Witcher fans.

6. In network games, when a player quits at the characters selecting stage, all other players are forced to quit and try to start network game again. That allows one player to abuse many other.

7. Triss ""Teleport"" spell is mightly overpowered. It allows Triss to collect two leads in a turn without any risk. I think, this is not the board game disbalance but the wrong implementation in computer game. Some other abilities with the text ""when you perform [stated action] {do something in addition}"" also work weird in the computer game. | Hasta hace poco los juegos de mesa los tenia olvidados desde hacia mucho tiempo.

-->POST SCRIPTUM<-- an.



Ich hab jetzt schon etliche Stunden in diesem Spiel verbracht. Es ist einfach so frustrierend was für ein potential dieses Spiel hat, aber komplett ungenutzt bleibt. Nicht nur die kompetenzen der Entwickler sind fraglich.

Die Grafik ist grundsätzlich nicht hochmodern, hat aber einfach einen Reiz.
Waffensounds sind unterirdisch auch Fahrzeuge hören sich richtig schlecht an.

Lächerlich ist, das sobald man Kritik am Spiel äußßert oder verbesserungsvorschläge hat, man sofort ausgeschlossen wird aus dem Forum und den Kommentaren.

Desweiteren betreiben die Entwickler das Spielsystem derart, das man ewig benötigt um etwas Freizuschalten. Hat man erstmal alles... sammeln sich die Credits natürlich über die Zeit sofern man nicht gerade 200.000Cr für ein Camo ausgibt.

Zu dem sind die Entwickler ULTRA FAUL, jeder deutsche Panzer hat beispielsweise das selbe Camo. Es wird sich also in keinster Weise mühe gegeben wirklich individualität zu schaffen.
Man muss sich folgendes vor Augen führen: Vor einem halben Jahr oder länger haben sau viele Panzer Camos bekommen, auf deutscher Seite haben alles die gleichen bekommen. Der Panzer ""Panther"" wurde außenvor gelassen. Erst vor kurzen haben dann der Panther und die Panzer IV ebenfalls Camos bekommen, ABER GENAU DIE SELBEN! Es wurde also einfach die Texture/UVMap ""Copy and Paste"" gemacht und auf den Panther und Panzer IV geklebt. Und dafür haben die nen halbes Jahr gebraucht.

Nun zu meinen größen Kritikpunkt und warum man dieses Spiel nicht herunterladen sollte:

Reperaturkosten für Waffen und Fahrzeuge!
Es ist ja völlig legitim das man Munition als Spieler eventuell bezahlen muss. Aber wenn mir dann noch vorgeschrieben wird WIE ich meine Munition nutzen soll, bekomm ich das kotzen!.

Wenn man einfach durch die gegend baller, oder im Kreis fährt mit dem EIGENEN Fahrzeug, wird man für ""EXP-FARMING"" gebannt.

Nicht zu letzt zahlt man für ein voll aufgepimptes STG44 bei einer 20/1 K/D mehr Reperaturen/Munition pro Match als man aus herausholen kann.

Und am besten ist wenn klamm heimlich nach einem Update die Reperaturkosten erhöht wurden!

Es hapert in diesem Spiel an so vielen dingen, man kann diese garnicht alle hier aufzählen. Es ist komplett:

-unfertig
-nicht richtig durchdacht
-spieler unfreundlich


Seit vielen Jahren hat sich an den Maps auch nichts geändert. Hin und wieder ändern sich mal gebäude oder positionen auf den Maps, aber die Spawnpoints sind immernoch die gleichen behinderten Spawnpoints. 

Ohne sinn und verstanden werden hier komplett sinnfrei Inhalte verändert und es wird sich nicht um die EIGENTLICHEN probleme im Spiel gekümmert. So zumbeispiel bleiben Projektile von Panzern einfach in Büschen hängen, oder ein Flugzeug kann einfach mal eine 75mm HE oder APCR wegstecken als wäre es ein laues lüftchen. Dabei ist es schon schwer als Panzerfahrer Flugzeuge zu treffen! Und das ist absolut keine Ausnahme! Sondern generell so!

Das aller schlimmste um was sich die Entwickler aber noch immernicht gekümmert haben obwohl es seit JAHREN angeprangert wird, ist der P-38 Flugzeug spamm, die P-38 kann jeden Panzer easy wegputzen und Auch Jeeps oder Motorräder sind kein problem. Das Spiel wird prinzip sofort unspielbar wenn mehr als 2 P-38 in der Luft sind. Besonders die Fallschirmspringer freuen sich!

Und was Flugzeuge angeht wäre wir beim nächsten Problem! Die Flugabwehrwaffen in diesem Spiel sind so extrem LÄCHERLICH, man kann einem Flugzeug mit einer VIERLINGSFLAK (4x20mm) mal so garkeinen wirklichen Schaden zufügen, aber die Piloten wissen EXAKT wo die Flugabwehr auf den Maps sitzt! Keine chance und mit der mobilen Flak auch keine chance.

Auch mit einer 20mm Bordkanone am Fahrzeug des Scharfschützen macht man dem Flugzeug keinen schaden, APCR/HE egal was man durchlädt. Aber die 20mm der Flugzeuge..... die Pustet alles von der Karte! Und genau das ist der Witz an der sache! Das ist schon IMMER und EWIG bekannt und wird nicht GEFIXT!

Im umkehrschluss kann man weder als Panzerfahrer noch als normaler Infanterist was gegen moderate bis gute Piloten machen! Währenddessen Infanteristen Panzer mit AT-Waffen mal eben in 3 Sekunden auflösen können, während Panzerfahrer keine gute rundumsicht genießen können ohne nicht die Rübe heraus zu stecken.

Ebenfalls ein riesen Fail ist das Panzerbalancing: Vergleich Hellcat gegen Panther.
Beide Fahrzeuge haben APCR und beide Fahrzeuge können sich gegenseitig mit zwei schüssen zerstören. Ja der Panther hat eine höhere Mündungsgeschwindigkeit was das Zielen minimal vereinfacht auf sehr großen Distanzen, solche Distanzen gibt es aber kaum bis garnicht im Spiel.
Durch die APCR Munition der Hellcat wird auch der Panzerungsvorteil des Panthers komplett weg negiert! 

Währenddessen die Hellcat praktisch genauso gut gepanzert ist wie der Panther und auch mit zwei schüssen einen Panzer der gleichen Klasse zerstören kann, ist die Hellcat im kontrast aber mal einfach so mobil wie ein Jeep. Und dazu kommt ein kleines Profil und ein sehr gutes Camo.


Also wurde auch hier beim Balancing TOTAL geschlafen. Und dabei wurden die Entwickler auch schon MEHRFACH auf das problem hingewiesen!

Die Entwickler sind einfach blutige Amateure. 


Daher empfehle ich auf das Spiel zu verzichten.

Tips für alle die dieses Spiel trotzdem Spielen wollen:
Am besten ihr Spiel nur mit Schaufel/Messer in möglichst langen Matches und versucht Fahnen/Eroberungspunkte zu sammeln. Den Ihr könnt so ofte Sterben wie ihr wollt ihr Zahlt keine Reperatur für Nahkampfwaffen und bekommt den vollen Paypout.

Oder Ihr hab nen Panzer und seit gut darin gute deutsche Modelle wären der 38t, Luchs, Panther und Königstiger. Dann kann man gut Credits farmen.
Das gleiche gilt für Flugzeuge. | Purtroppo il gioco è incredibilmente orientato al grinding e cerca in ogni modo possibile, patch dopo patch, di farti aprire il portafoglio (ammesso tu non voglia passare mesi per avere qualcosa).
Gli sviluppatori non ascoltano la community, delle tantissime buone idee che vengono suggerite ogni giorno sia sul forum di Steam che su quello del gioco ne viene presa una minima parte e mescolata con cose che nessuno ha chiesto (e che, spesso, nessuno vuole) e per ogni problema che viene risolto ne vengono inseriti altri.
Nelle suddette patch vengono inoltre ""ninjate"" cose tipo l'aumento di prezzi, la diminuzione dell'exp (dal quale dipendono i crediti) per determinate azioni; ovviamente non viene emesso alcun changelog in modo che non si sappia (di solito queste passano sotto il nome di ""hotfix"").
Le armi sono veramente irrealistiche e sbilanciate, la cosiddetta ""war"" (schermata ""generals"") è ancora più sbilanciata e viene spesso monopolizzata da una piuttosto che dall'altra fazione, la fazione tedesca è ridicola.
Spero vivamente che queste (e le tante altre) cose vengano prima o poi recepite da Reto e corrette, sia a livello di codice che di comportamento degli sviluppatori, ma fintanto che ciò non avverrà sconsiglio il gioco. | 一款不错的游戏

 | I'm afraid I cannot recommend this game. I tried, I played it for a while and I might continue to play it (in a more limited way), but honestly I think I'm done.

There are a few technical problems with the game:
Performance of the game varies highly between updates. I got anything from sustained 60 fps (with vsync on) at high quality setting to 20-25 on the lowest quality.
Weird lag issues. Game freezes momentarily on certain occasions, sometimes at crucial events, eg. just before being killed. This is not related to CPU or memory nor GFX card. I doubt it's network related. If it is, it's server side.

The game also feels a bit unbalanced. If enemy has air superiority, you're doomed. As ground unit there's not a lot you can do. This brings me to the next frustrating fact: you have several characters each has several weapons. You cannot swap [strike]characters or[/strike] weapons during a match. You have to leave the match, leave the squad and then you can swap weapons.

[i]EDIT: apparently you can swap characters if you have more than one of the same class. Thanks to RooZ for bringing this up. I haven't tested it, though. Swapping for a different class is possible if the squad has proper slots[/i]

There's a lot of griding as many have said. Personally I don't mind griding per se. What  I do mind is having to play for extended amount of time at a severe disadvantage. So either you pay money to upgrade fast or you are basically working for Reto as unpaid cannon fodder for their paying customers. In some games if you're good you may get a fighting chance. But not here. As infantry - yes. As tank crewman, not really. You will be put against superior tanks that you cannot harm with your puny cannon. And when you die you'll have to wait before spawning again and then walk or drive for a while to get to the action. There's a lot of waiting and walking in this game. I guess that makes it a more realistic military simulation. ;)

The grind is the price of a free game you say. Fair enough. However this game also suffers from the same problems as any other FPS, free or not. The lack of teamplay. When I first started playing H&G I saw how team actions (capturing) actually gives you significantly more score points compared to just killing an enemy. I said ""wonderful, they found a way to make people actually do objectives"". Sadly I was mistaken. Points schmoints. There are still very few people who will actively engage in coordinated cooperative gameplay. You'll get a circle of campers just outside capture zone. People will use resources without considering they're limited and waste them. Tank drivers will not rotate tanks so that support gunners may engage targets. Vehicles with MGs are never parked with their guns facing enemy positions. A fair amount will not follow common sense regarding objective selection and some will even roam aimlessly around the map.

I'd gladly pay money for a game with a nice teamplay-oriented community but this one isn't it.

So, should you play this free game? After all I said I might continue. If you do, stick to infantry, most vestatile, easiest to survive. Get a car or a motorbike to get from spawn area to the action. If you go for any other class, expect a lot more grinding and consider that your leveling strategy and point investment may be subverted by game designers at any point."

Лучшая часть из всех, пятая и шестая рядом не стояли! Не думаю что и седьмая будет чем-то лучше чем эта. | Actually a lot of fun and way fewer bugs than CIV VII | It's not *bad* per se, but it's not good either. There's a lot of stuff here that's just an objective step backward from Civ 5, even very simple UI stuff. Take for example the small bar that runs along the top of your screen in Civ games. This is used to display basic information, like what resources you have, what your general happiness level is, how many trade routes you have available and how many are active, etc. 

For some reason, in Beyond Earth they chose to REMOVE the trade routes from this bar. Now if you want to see how many trade routes you have and which are active, you have to click on ""additional information"" and then select the trade route overview. The ""additional information"" button is also on the bottom right now, along with spy overview and a bunch of other things. It's completely flipped from Civ 5 (and Civ 6), so it constantly throws your brain for a loop because you're not used to going to the bottom right corner for information. 

Diplomacy is also kind of a mess. From what I've been able to tell so far, there isn't actually a way to trade for resources. Your ""trade"" agreements with other civs are more like small-scale research agreements, and what you can barter for is dependent on the civ's personality. For example, Al Falah seems to be focused on production because their agreements give you stuff like an increase in energy yield for your capital, letting you build worker units for free, etc. It's not bad, you can get some useful stuff, it's just odd that you're not trading for actual resources. I don't have any Firaxite, but the American Reclamation Corporation does. Why can't I just ask to trade for it? But what can be much worse is your actual relationship with other civs. If you are ""cooperating"" with another civ (this game's equivalent of being friendly), you may be tempted to form an alliance with them. For the love of god, DO NOT do this. I made the mistake of proposing an alliance with Al Falah and was IMMEDIATELY thrust into a war with every single civ they were at war with (half the civs on the map). 

Then there are other mechanics that are just half-baked. The xeno wildlife is this game's version of barbarians, and the *idea* behind them is cool. Most of them aren't outright hostile and they'll leave you alone as long as you don't get too close. You can destroy their nests to keep them from spawning if they're in the way, but that can be risky early on. They're all connected by a hive-mind so it'll make the rest of them REALLY mad at you. Conversely, you can research an ability that lets your explorers ""leash"" xeno units and make them your own (there's also research that let you produce your own xeno units). The problem is, leashing wild xenos is mostly pointless. They're quickly outpaced by normal military units, and you can't upgrade them. For example, the xeno cavalry unit is just humans riding on raptor bugs. If you leash a few wild raptor bugs, you *should* be able to upgrade them to cavalry units once you've researched alien domestication. But you can't. Why? I dunno.  

Most of the game is like this. There's a lot of neat ideas here, but none of them were ever fleshed out. Firaxis only released one small expansion for this game and a map pack, then promptly abandoned it. | I want to like this game but it crashes literally all the time. It is super unstable and currently unplayable for a huge number of people. I keep trying to play it, and it crashes every time I load a world. | Summary: I am fond of this game. It is closer to Civ 5 than Civ 6 or Alpha Centauri, but has enough unique systems to stand on it's own. The Sci-Fi atmosphere is executed well and the options for combat and growth become thick by mid-game, making combat more interesting than other Civ entries. Be sure to buy it with the Rising Tide expansion, this changes the game a great deal. The game is often on sale.

Positives: 
    Technology Advancement: The tech tree is made a circular web of interacting technologies, each with branches of deeper concept research. The techs themselves are largely interesting and gaining research by trade, infrastructure, and quests feels theme appropriate, The research is deeply rooted in the concept of Ideological Affinity which is a new Civ concept that lends to making oft overlooked tech choices interesting. There is a lot of replay-ability here. 
    Diplomacy: Rising Tide opens up a Diplomacy system that measures respect/fear and offers the investment of political capital into Meaningful trade agreements and/or the advancement of your Leader's unique power and investment in 3 more society powers that represent your chosen style of Statecraft.  As a result, starting character powers aren't as important as the other choices you make along the way; almost like choosing Era cultures in Humankind or Civ 7.
    Aliens: The Dev choice to incorporate Sid Meyer's original idea of a self-aware planet that can be subjugated or assimilated is a welcome homage to the great game Alpha Centauri.
    Combat: Combat starts out simple and indistinguishable from Civ 5, but as Technologies are unlocked, unit interaction and customization optimization opens up a fun and highly customized mid-game slug fest experience.

Negatives:
    AI: The NPCs run on a slightly modified Civ 5 AI, from what I can tell. They aren't great at Naval warfare, fail to capitalize on airpower, ignore combat applications of satellites, and have no understanding of the Affinity and Technology advantages. Endgame against the AI just isn't challenging and not many people play the vanilla game, so PvP options are limited. You will have more fun roleplaying and outbuilding the AI than in a real head-to-head experience.
    Terrain Colors: The art choice in colors makes terrain types very hard to tell with the naked eye. The rest of the artwork is great! Why the bland color scheme for biomes?
    Endgame: The victory conditions sound EPIC, but are SLOGS in practice. By the time you have the Tech to make a victory run, you've almost always dominated the planet. Making this worse, some of the Victory Conditions take 20-40 turns or even longer! Combined with an AI that just doesn't understand how to use a laundry list of tech, culture, and affinity upgrades in late game, we end up with an endgame I have rarely indulged in.

Rate: 7 of 10   Well worth it on sale, if you are a Sci-Fi buff! The game is genuinely fun."

With other games, I would have left it at that, but with Frostpunk, my brain kept working on different strategies even in my sleep. The next day I started again and managed to build a more gentle society that was more fit for survival. Kept hundreds of people alive without crossing any serious moral lines. I'm worried, that I can't stop thinking about more effective way to build my city and society. Maybe I can do it without child labor? Maybe there's a way for me to take in all refugees I encounter? The tight focus of the game helps my thoughts get completely lost among the opportunities. Love it.

	Сюжет повествует о семье Бергсонов, они живут в горах, перебрались они сюда и за деспотии бывшей правительницы. Проводя дни в гармонии и уюте семейного гнездышка, семья замечает неладное. Гибнут растения и животные, на их гору, пришла скверна…Такая простенькая завязка, подарит нам замечательную, а главное занимательную история на 20+ часов. Во время прохождения игра постарается не дать тебе заскучать ни на минуту, то интересную ситуацию с жизни семьи покажет, то подкинет очередную неприятность, которую Бергсонам предстоит решить, а попутно и защитить своих близких. По мере всего повествования, начиная с первых минут и заканчивая титрами, ты чувствуешь сплоченность семьи, такая прочная связь еще больше увлекает и заставляет быть частью истории. Рассказ Бергсонов многому нас учит, учит ценить и заботится о своей семье, учит уважению к опыту и мудрости старшего поколения, и наконец учит главному, сила любви и надежды, способна творить чудеса.

	Геймплей, еще одна изюминка с пышной грозди плюсов игры. На выбор нам предстоит семь колоритных персонажей, каждый из которых обладает своим уникальным оружием и стилем боя. По началу те или иные индивиды могут не понравится, но если дать им шанс, сыграть героем два-три забега, ты поймешь, баланс сил выверен почти идеально. Любой боец имеет как свои сильные стороны, так и недостатки. Проявляются они тоже по-разному, кто-то силен против больших групп врагов, кто-то быстр и стремителен, а кто-то размерен и осторожен. Стиль героя напрямую зависит от характера персонажа, от его предпочтений и привычек в повседневности. Замечать такие детали, ну очень увлекательно. Незабываемые эмоции после каждого забега.

	 Добрая история, атмосфера уюта, занимательный игровой процесс, в сочетании с визуалом радующим глаз и ласкающим ухо музыкальным сопровождением, игра дарит только положительные и самые теплые эмоции, даже в самые холодные и дождливые дни.

	На этом спасибо. Играем в хорошие игры и не теряемся! А, и еще… друзья, пожалуйста, цените своих родных и близких!!!
 | Esse jogo é único! Possui um estilo divertido e atraente que mistura a pegada do Diablo com games roguelike, onde você precisa ir jogando para se tornar mais forte e conseguir passar os objetivos.

Recomendo demais para quem curte jogos do gênero. Seu preço em promoção é excelente e vale cada centavo investido. | this game has the worst netcode I have ever experienced in a multiplayer game. Do not purchase this if your intent is to play it with a friend.

- The menu state machine is 100% retarded. Joining a multiplayer game breaks every time you try to do it while already in the game. It can handle exactly 1 screen transition without breaking the state machine and we gave up trying to find it and used steam's option to join from the steam library. Once in multiplayer both characters can go to character selection but if they both do the game is locked, instead one player has to go to character selection and then the other has to ""join"" their character selection.

- player position sync is server-authoratative with rubber-band client side prediction while I suspect the server is attempting to replay client movement input (instead of just receiving their position as a vector). That means the player that isn't hosting is connected to an invisible point by a rubber band and they snap back to that location constantly as its position slowly gets updated by the server. The effect is like ice skating on a treadmill that changes directions randomly. After moving your character slides to wherever the server thinks you are based on how it interpreted your button presses which, with any latency at all, is always wrong and you slide all over the map uncontrollably flying into traps and enemies and dying constantly.

- any time the host opens a UI element or has a tutorial pop-up on their screen, network synchronization stops and the 2nd player de-syncs entirely

Literally unplayable for the 2nd character I don't understand how none of the other reviews are mentioning this. My theory is that no real human has ever played this game. Only game journalists. | Can't belive I've slept on this game for so long. It feels like old arcade games like Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara with the added benefit that the more you play, the stronger your characters develop and the more perks you unlock for the entire family. Each member is a character with his or hers own set of moves and special abilities, as well as there being perks that affect all characters across the board. The story progression is neatly and seamlessly integrated into the overall progression, rewarding you with cutscenes for every time you return home, be it by completing the level or, more often, dying. But it's a part of the progression. 

The graphics might not be the best, but for an OG (Original Commodore 64, Nintendo 8bits Gamer) it only brings up nostalgia and that huge pixel, EGA charm. Kinda reminds me of the greatest RPG I have ever played, quest for glory, but done in a much more elaborate manner. I see myself coming back to this game over and over. | This is a fun, medium-sized rougelite action game. The stand out positives are the gorgeous art style and the diversity of character play styles. The weaker point is the sophomoric story. The game isn't too ambitious in what it's going for overall, but it executes well on what it tries to do."

 | [h1] This War of Mine não é um game comum. Para ser sincero, ele não é um game. Ele é uma experiência dolorosa, difícil de aceitar e extremamente necessária no universo dos video games. [/h1]

A realidade que temos nos games é a seguinte: gráficos cada vez mais realistas e um culto ou glorificação da violência. Vibramos quando conseguimos aquele head shot bem dado, ganhamos bônus por matar vários inimigos ao mesmo tempo, achamos chato quando não há sangue depois de um soldado explodir com um foguete vindo sabe-se lá de onde e por aí vai. This War of Mine vem te lembrar que a guerra não é uma jornada para ser o melhor soldado do universo e que, no final das contas, ela é só o desperdício de vidas humanas. Coisa que aparentemente todo o mercado esqueceu.

This War of Mine machuca. Machuca porque você sabe que as coisas não estão fáceis e para sobreviver no meio da guerra você terá que sujar suas mãos. Você não tem comida, remédios ou ataduras para sobreviver, mas o casal de idosos do outro lado da rua pode ter, mas se recusam a abrir a porta. O que fala mais alto? Seu instinto de sobrevivência ou sua humanidade? O hospital esta tratando de feridos com o que restou de remédios, mas quem precisa de mais remédios? Você ou os outros sobreviventes? Seus amigos estão desnutridos e não irão sobreviver sem comer. Para quem deve ficar a última lata de comida?
São essas as situações que você viverá constantemente durante o game. Situações que aconteceram e acontecem no mundo todo: Ucrânia, Polônia, França, Inglaterra, Alemanha, China, Japão, Espanha, Malvinas, Congo, Argélia, Serra Leoa, Iraque, Afeganistão...

A mecânica do game é simples: clique no sobrevivente que quer controlar e onde quer que ele vá. Clique nos ícones para realizar ações: procurar suprimentos, subir ou descer escadas, construir ferramentas, se esconder, atirar, fugir... A simplicidade da jogabilidade é um contraste com a complexidade de gerenciar seus recursos e sobreviventes.
Durante o dia, você deve manter seu abrigo e sobreviventes nas melhores condições possíveis, construindo ferramentas, preparando alguma comida, cuidando de ferimentos, descansando etc. De noite, você deve escolher quem vai sair atrás de suprimentos na cidade sitiada, quem vai descansar no abrigo e quem vai ficar de vigia contra possíveis saqueadores. Isso, é claro, se você tiver sobreviventes e recursos para tudo isso.

Os gráficos são frios, escuros, quase rabiscos feitos numa parede velha. Essa aparência reforça o cenário caótico e sem esperanças da guerra. Não espere aqui alguma cor vibrante no uniforme de um soldado, uma pintura dourada na arma de algum rebelde morto ou várias partículas numa explosão de um morteiro. O game retrata a guerra, não uma brincadeira para vender. A mesma coisa vale para os efeitos sonoros. Nada de marchas sinfônicas ou algum rock para dar adrenalina. Apenas ruídos e barulhos e uma melancólica música a cada dia.

[b] This War of Mine é um tapa na cara de muito estúdio grande, que gosta de retratar a guerra como a superação de um soldado contra um mal maior e glorificar a morte de quem esta do outro lado da arma. Produzido por um pequeno estúdio polonês, o game é uma obra prima e um pedido de paz no mundo através dos games. [/b] | 不要在二周目结束前寻找攻略。
不要畏惧困难。
不要害怕这把不能妥善通关。
生活本来就没有攻略。 |   비디오 게임 역사에 있어서 ‘현대전’은 엔터테인먼트로서 소비되어왔다. 1997년에 ‘톰 클랜시’ 프렌차이즈가 인기를 끌게 되면서 특수부대가 세계의 테러조직에 맞선다는 줄거리는 세기말의 영웅서사시가 되었고, 2007년도에 <콜 오브 듀티 4 : 모던 워페어>와 그 시리즈가 세계적으로 유례없는 흥행을 거둠에 따라 그 서사는 열광적인 반응과 함께 하나의 패러다임을 구축하게 된다.

  이후 현대전을 다루는 게임의 양상은 각 장르별 차이는 있으나 <모던 워페어>가 가지고 있던 파급력 즉, 일반인들은 접하기 힘든 특수부대원들의 전술적인 용맹함과 이들이 활동하는 비밀스러운 세계를 마치 여행 다큐멘터리의 이국적인 풍경처럼 묘사하는데 집중하며 이들에 대한 환상을 충족시켜왔다. <메달 오브 아너>의 리부트 시리즈는 실화를 차용해 아프가니스탄 전쟁의 사실적인 모습을 그려냈으며 <톰 클랜시의 엔드워>와 <월드 인 컨플릭트>는 바로 그런 전장의 최일선에서 게이머들을 전지적인 입장에 선 군 지휘관으로서의 대리만족을 수행했다.

  그러나 이러한 전쟁의 엔터테인먼트화는 현재 일어나고 있는 수많은 비극과 폭력을 지나치게 가볍게 접근한다는 비판에서 자유로울 수 없었다. 특히, <모던 워페어> 시리즈가 가지고 있는 수많은 장점들은 – 이미 헐리웃에서 많이 사용했던 소재를 차용한 것에 불과하며 논의 자체도 새로울 것이 없었으나- 게임에 대해 이러한 우려의 시각이 더욱 강했던 이유는 -매체 자체에 대한 경계심이 기저에 깔려 있긴 하지만- 영화를 포함한 기존의 매체들과는 달리 수용자들이 서사의 흐름에 직접적으로 개입해 이를 주체적으로 이끈다는 근본적인 차이가 있었으며, 영화업계와 달리 게임업계에서 전쟁을 다루는 방식에 있어 이에 있어 별다른 의식은 보이지 않았기 때문이다.

  <디스 워 오브 마인>은 기존의 방식에 대해 반기를 든다. <디스 워 오브 마인>은 사악한 테러리스트와 맞서 싸우는 특수부대원들의 이야기가 아니다. 압제에 맞서 싸우는 혁명군이 되는 것도 아니며 정예군을 지휘하는 사령관이 되는 것 아니다. 등장인물들은 모두들 평범하게 일상을 살았던 도시민들이며, 전쟁이라는 상황 속에서 단지 스스로의 생존을 위해 처절하게 몸부림치는 이들일 뿐이다. 게임의 주 무대가 되는 전쟁에 대한 서사는 전후내막을 과감히 생략해버리며 이를 게임 내의 라디오를 통해 드러나는 정부군과 반군의 전쟁 현황으로 단순화 시킨다. 민간인들에게 전쟁의 정당성이란 존재하지 않으며 또한 이러한 전쟁의 흐름을 다루는 서사적 기교는 중요치 않다. 다만 그로 인해 세상 모든 것이 바뀌어버렸을 뿐이며, 두 세력이 전쟁을 멈추는 순간까지 어떻게든 살아가는 것 그 자체가 이들의 과제이며 <디스 워 오브 마인>의 서사인 것이다.

  이러한 점에 있어서는, 전쟁의 엔터테인먼트화에 대한 비판을 가했던 <스펙 옵스 : 더 라인>과도 차별을 둔다. 비록 게임 매체 속에서의 살상행위에 대한 문제의식을, 마틴 워커 대위가 두바이의 혼돈 속에서 콘라드 대령이 만들어 놓은 광기에 서서히 미쳐가는 모습을 통해 나타냈으나, 여전히 그는 슈터 게임의 주인공이며, 훈련받은 전투원이라는 배경에 걸맞게 초인적인 모습이 드러나는 것은 어쩔 수가 없는 한계였다. 그러나 <디스 워 오브 마인>의 주인공들은 전쟁 이전에는 축구선수, 소방수, 건축업자, 가정주부 등의, 다양하지만 어디서든 흔히 볼 수 있는 삶을 살았던 평범한 사람들이다.

  시간의 흐름 매 순간마다 게이머는 윤리적 갈등에 휩싸이게 된다. 게임은 게이머에게 특정한 요구를 하지 않는다. 그러나 상황을 한계까지 몰고 간다. 모두가 굶주리고, 서서히 다가오는 한파에 병들며, 하루가 멀고 밤마다 약탈자들이 집에 쳐들어오는데, 이에 맞서 싸우다가 공동체 일원이 큰 부상을 입는다. 음식과 의약품이 절실한데, 도시 외곽에 노부부가 사는 집에는 챙겨 갈만한 것들이 풍족하게 쌓여있다.

  여기서 윤리적 딜레마가 생긴다. 약탈자들의 만행에 치를 떨지만, 이를 극복하려면 역시 누군가를 약탈해야 한다. 총으로 무장한 사람들의 집에 침입하기엔 위험부담이 크다. 결국 제일 좋은 방법은 만만한 상대를 찾아 모든 걸 빼앗아버리는 것이다. 게임은 이러한 행위에 대해 아무런 간섭도 하지 않는다. 그리고 그런 파렴치한 짓을 저지른다고 해서 게이머에게 가해지는 제약은 없다. 오히려 생존에 더 적합한 행위가 될 수도 있다. 비록, 게임이 진행되는 약 30일의 기간 동안 이타적인 선택을 할 기회는 계속 주어지나 그에 필요한 희생과 상응하는 보상이 일치하지 않는다. 결국 전쟁이라는 위험 앞에서 윤리는 생존과 힘의 논리에 무너지고 마는 것이다.

  <디스 워 오브 마인>의 전체적인 인상은 소재에 비해 다소 힘이 부족한 편이다. 솔직히 말해 <데드라이트>의 시각적 스타일과 <라스트 스탠드 : 데드존>의 게임 디자인을 적당히 섞어놓은 것 같은, 어디서 본 듯한 느낌은 게임 전반적으로 지울 수 없기는 하다. 그러나 이런 사소한 실망을 감안한다면, 주류 게임업계에서 전쟁을 다루는 방식이 군인으로서 슈터와 시뮬레이션 장르에 집중되어 있다는 것과 <디스 워 오브 마인>이 소규모 인디 게임이라는 것을 상기해본다면, ‘In war, Not everyone is soldier’라는 표어는 전쟁과 게임업계 전반을 통틀어 아우르는 하나의 문제의식으로서의 가치를 가지지 않을까.

I really enjoyed the problem solving, and scenario planning aspect of the game.  It is a ton of fun to play, once you figure it out, and this is where this game falls down, in guiding new players.  

I would highly recommend new players to not shun character guides and other online resources to get going.  This is a ten year old game and I think they purposefully designed the game around ""discovery"" mechanics (especially around character skill progression and item effects) so you learn by doing,  Which I think would be fine if you unlocked something that documented the information for you so if you step away for a few weeks you don't forget.  I find myself wasting resources to ""find out"" what something does only to have forgotten even later in the play through. 

Personally I think if this game underwent a UX/UI cleanup, slightly better tutorialization of some of the mechanics and better information persistance you could re-release this game today and it would attract a huge following. | OK game. Would be awesome without the following two issues. First, the game occasionally CTDs between floors and deletes the autosave (the only allowed save) in the process - so game over. Secondly, large monster waves are a big blob of moving pixels. It is almost impossible to tell which monsters and how many are attacking your heroes. Looks ugly too. I do not get why people like pixel art in this game. Pixel art was not a choice but a necessity back in the day. The best old pixel art (e.g. Prince of Persia, Lemmings) also looked way better than this hot mess. | Addictive, good looking, funny, rogue type game that makes you utilize brain and try it in different play modes.

9/10

Cons - sometimes it is too dependent on random elements. | Simply one of my favorite games of all time. DoTE is a fun little tower defense that can be played solo or with a group (up to four players.) There is quite a few characters to unlock with their own unique play styles and abilities. The difficulty levels are a bit of satire “easy” is quite damn hard, it’s extremely challenging to finish the dungeon. Where as “too easy” is well, just that after you get the hang of things, still a fairly good challenge starting out and later on with the different launch pods you unlock after successful playthroughs. FIDS resources are the same as other endless games. If you enjoy resource management and tower defense you should love this. | Не цікава, не весела, цілком порожня гра із високим порогом входження.

Якщо у цивці у фракцій є невеличкі відмінності які виражені парою юнітів і перками, то тут у однієї можна переміщати цілі міста, інша тераформує місцевість під себе, а дехто взагалі нормально почуває себе тільки у воді. Але є тут і недоліки які властиві більшості ігр цього жанру.

A psychedelic diamond. | A社 (Amplitude Studios) 的無盡系列策略遊戲，包括《ENDLESS Space》1跟2、《無盡帝國》，這些遊戲能用的派系不多，但每個派系都很有特色，使用不同派系時，策略必須大幅改變，在這方面比《文明帝國》系列有趣，《文明帝國》系列加上DLC後有很多派系，但不同派系的差異較小，而且有不少派系的特徵比較平淡無趣。
A社是規模不大的獨立開發商，為了節省成本，A社遊戲的聲光效果比不上大作，例如無盡系列的派系領導，畫面和語音較簡陋，但A社擅長設計感，用設計感彌補成本劣勢，遊戲中的各種美術設計都很好看，音樂與音效也不錯。
A社的策略遊戲，有很多要素都是模仿《文明帝國》系列，但A社也有各種創新，例如無盡系列，比《文明帝國6》更早採用""城市區域系統""，也比《文明7》更早採用：地形高低差、改良設施不用工人。A社《HUMANKIND》可途中切換不同派系，《文明帝國7》也有採用，結果《文明帝國》越來越像A社遊戲，有城市區域系統、地形高低差、改良設施不用工人、可途中切換不同派系。
幾年前A社預告《HUMANKIND》的時候，我原本希望它能沿用無盡傳統：派系比《文明帝國》少、但更有特色，可惜A社走相反路線，《HUMANKIND》派系非常多，但都較沒特色。

It's quite a bit bigger than either of those examples, and much like Templar Battleforce, you could probably spend hundreds of hours optimising your crew and ship.

That said, much like Templar Battleforce, it's not remotely clear why you'd really want to do that, and there's not much in game to help you figure anything out. It is very much a Trese Brothers game, and you will love it or hate it accordingly.

I'd suggest it's a good buy at $10. Play for two hours -  just do the quest, but skip the dialog (or you won't get very far into it). It's likely you will die and not get much done, but it will give you a good feel for what the core gameplay loop is like as much of that is touched on in that first quest. | I really tried to like this game, however I can't get into it
Main problem is balance. Game is too easy or too difficult. Nothing in-between. Battle skills are useless because in easy fights you don't need them and in difficult ones - they won't save you. 
Also dice roll mechanic is complicated so it's barely understandable. Therefore the player doesn't know if one has high or low chances of success
Also in-game time flies so fast that I had feeling I barely done anything and decades already have passed.

The only things I don't like about this game is the lack of garbage treatment. There is only a garbage landfill and a garbage incineration plant. When you have a lot of citizens producing a lot of trash it is very hard to stop it from happening since the garbage landfills barely do anything, and when it happens for too long more abandoned buildings will show up which are really annoying to bulldoze. 
      
     People who like to be the leader and take charge, like me, would enjoy playing Cities:Skylines 2. I really enjoy the fact that whenever your bored you can just start a new world and flood your city with poo.
     
     You can do everything from creating road plans to raising taxes, laying down pipe to terraforming an entire mountain surrounding your city. This game is definitely for those aspiring to be an engineer but don't want the complexity of it.
     
      The first time I bought Cities:Skylines 1 i was so eager and I was talking about it for days because I watch RealCivilEngineer play Cities:Skylines, and I was just immediately captivated by the possibilities of what my city can become. This game is definitely for the people who are creative and want to express the creativity in the form of building your own city.
    
      All in all Cities:Skylines 1 is a great game for beginners learning to be a engineer but for people who want better graphics, mechanics, building, and plays on windows, definitely go for Cities:Skylines 2.

      If the devs happening to be reading this, please make Cities:Skylines 2 available to play on Mac. It was very frustrating buying Cities:Skylines 2 the realizing that it was for windows only, and the pain I felt realizing that I couldn't play it and waiting for it to be refunded. But at least I have Cities:Skylines 1 I can play with less features and worse graphics even though I want to be an Engineer. Sorry for my sob story but this is my way of venting so deal with it. | Great game, terrible amount of DLCs. Still better than Cities Skylines 2, Mods are carrying hard. | After 532 hours of meticulously laying roads, zoning districts, and perfecting public transit routes, I can safely say that Cities: Skylines is a city-building masterpiece that deserves every second of your time. The level of detail and control you have over the growth and management of your city is both addicting and rewarding. Each decision from budget allocations to traffic flow is crucial to maintaining a thriving metropolis that feels genuinely alive. The base game already offers an extensive toolkit, but the robust modding community truly takes things to the next level with endless possibilities for customization. If you love city builders or simulation games, Cities: Skylines is absolutely worth playing. My 532 hours in-game and counting should speak for themselves. | 童年的幻想在这一刻能以另一种形式实现，梦中的摩天大厦和交通系统都能真真切切的展现在虚拟的城市里，这就足够了 | крутая игра,строил город 5 часов ,построил нефтяную промышленность,в итоге все снесло ураганом нахуй 10 пробок из 10"

Действия в игре происходят в Париже, куда герой первой части Кевин Кламели отправился, спасаясь от властей.

Геймплей очень простой, у вас есть оружие, перед вами есть цели, убивай не хочу ;)

Графика очень сильно изменилась по сравнению с первой частью. Сейчас она очень хорошая.

В игре есть разнообразные боссы которых убить не так просто как обычных монстров.

[b]В общем и целом игра очень хорошая, рекомендую[/b] | The server filters in this game are some of the worst in any game I have ever played. 

The ""No custom servers"" option just does not work. For example like 20% of the time when joining a server it starts a download for either plugins or a map. 

Creating your own server sometimes wont work, Because you are not hosting a server, you are looking for one that already exists to ""take over""  so sometimes you cant host what you want. 

And on top of those 2 things you can only filter for 1 map/difficulty/Gamemode Rather than being able to filter out everything you do/don't want. For example [only wanting to see 4 maps on Hard and Hell on earth] [and only 4 or 7 long] 

These create annoying issues where you join a normal looking server and either start to download stuff you don't want or whole parts of the game are just disabled. 

Why even think about buying KF3 when they cant fix 2 issues with KF2 that would make the game 100x better. | Отличный кооператив для развлечения.
killing floor 2 - это в первую очередь отличнейшая кооперативная стрелялка. Первое что приходит в голову играя в неё это L4D. Но в отличии от L4D тут нет такого сюжета, тут есть волны монстров | 游戏是好玩的，打折可以无脑入。但整个游戏就是一坨屎山一样堆到了近100个G，这么劣质的材质包占这么大地方开发商你觉得合适吗 | Killing Floor 2 is basically just an update of the original game with a fixed leveling system and a handful of other changes. 

The biggest issue with the original Killing Floor was that it had a leveling system where leveling up perks often involved doing tedious tasks instead of just playing the game. Commandos had to go out of their way to hunt stealthed enemies and farm them, Support class players had to sit around welding doors, and a medics optimal leveling was to do nothing but heal. Oftentimes this just meant farming this experience on an empty server under specific conditions as leveling through normal play took too long. In Killing Floor 2 one levels a perk using those perks weapons and abilities - just playing the game properly. The game has also been better balanced so that lower leveled players can do reasonably well on higher difficulties and that leveling itself is a significantly faster experience. Only the Hell on Earth difficulty demands a high or maxxed level perk to play through. 

Alot of the new stuff is a mixed bag. The new weapons are a good addition to the game, and the medic perk gets quite a few of them. Weapons now share perks so other classes can viably support medics as healers without impacting their role. The SWAT perk does not really scale well for the higher difficulties as it does not fill any role because of its lack of firepower and meaningful abilities and the Survivalist just outright tries not to fill any role. The new enemies and bosses make the game a lot more interesting and challenging, but some of the bosses are comically easy, while others are extremely difficult. Some new enemies like the E.D.A.R feel out of place with their abilities and aesthetic, but most of the new adds make the game more interesting while fitting in with the old cast. 

There is not much reason to play the first game over this new one. Pretty much every change is for the better and the changes that are not that good are not that big of a deal.

The game has a pretty steep learning curve, does not hold your hand, or offer much in the form of guidance.  But it is oh so rewarding when you do get the hang of it and are able to take on the more challenging battles the game has to offer.

-Get your first contract

I cannot stress enough how much I recommend starting on the beginner difficulty, otherwise there is a high chance you will rage quit and conclude that the game is poorly balanced.

It's a hard game and you will likely find yourself reloading saves but its also a quite well made and in depth turn based combat game. It feels very rewarding as you evolve from a group of losers barely scraping by to a small army full of hardened combatants. | This game is pretty much turn based mount and blade, which is not really a good thing. Like M&B, I had fun for awhile, until i realized that there is nothing tactical about the game and every battle becomes pretty repetitive. The game starts every battle with your sides in two lines within almost one turns movement distance. Very tactical. I know I would deploy my guys right up there within range of archers. The terrain for each battle is generated upon entering the battle, so you may start the battle with your back against a hill. Did my guys march right down a hill and start battle at the foot of the hill my enemies are on. Very Tactical. The game kind of treats armor and shields as a second health bar, so it just becomes swinging attrition. The only bonus you get for placement of troops is a mild accuracy bonus. Mild. So you surround a guy with a shield and he somehow blocks every swing with a shield until the shield is destroyed. Then do the same for armor. Tactical as hell. Yes some weapons deal more damage to shields or armor, but ultimately it is still a very shallow ""tactical"" experience. | Fun Game! Challenging, with a learning curve to it. Not crazy though.

[b]Hey guys, I'm about to write my first impressions about the game, but keep in mind that this is beta / pre-order version. Also, this review is intended for Football Manager players that already know how to play this game.[/b]

Pros: 


[list]
    [*] Most advanced animations yet in any Football Manager edition. What I mean by that is the fact that FINALLY you can see the difference in Flair / Quality between 2 players. New dribblings, crosses, decisions and finishing in front of goal. It was FM13 since I've been asking for more realistic dribblings / decisions / crosses in the final third but the game never got quite there, until now. Let me give you a short example: I am playing as AC Milan and Jeremy Menez was attacking the right flank as a Winger-Attack. In any of the previous versions, he would have done 3 possible things: attack the byline and cross, cutting into the penalty area or pass the ball back to the overlappting full back. Now, I noticed something absolutly beautiful: He did neither of those. His decision was to dribble 2 players like they were nothing by cutting inside the penalty area and then he launched a lobbed-cross to Luiz Adriano who was rushing forward from a deeper position. Now, besides his way of dribbling (which i've never seen before in FM), we can easily notice another MAGNIFICENT improvement: lobbed crosses. This kind of crosses are a must in a game like FM and I am finally happy it was introduced. So yes, new animations / decisions / dribblings / crossings. You can finally see the difference between 15 Flair and 18 Flair so to speak.
    [*] Game is in a much better state beta wise than it was last year (loading times, match engine and leagues)
    [*] Fast loading / saving times. Last year's beta was awful regarding saving times. It was something that eventually got fixed, but FM16 doesn't have this problem at all. In fact, to me it seems than the game loads/saves faster than FM15.
    [*] 3D Match Engine is another thing that pleasantly surprised me (played 3 games). By this I mean it feels smoother, no visible glitches and artefacts. Last year we had all sorts of problems with 3d engine performance until it got fixed (the game ran choppy and stuttering a lot on anything above ""medium"" quality no matter how powerful your machine was). In this regard, FM 2016 shines right from the start. I am able to play the game on highest graphical settings.
    [*] One of the biggest improvements in my opinion is ProZone analysis tool. This tool is so so much better than what we had before. If you are the kind of manager that likes to keep tabs on every aspect of the tactic you are creating, than I swear, ProZone is exactly what you've been waiting for. 
    [*] New tactical framework is excelent  in my opinion, definetly much better than last year's, especially if you are a newcomer to the game. For new players it is much easier to make them understand what each setting does and for the experienced players, well, it makes their ""job"" easier.
    [*] Another pro of FM 16 is the actual Player Profile Screen which wasn't completly revamped but the slight adjustments SI made are welcome. You can get almost every necessary info about a player just by clicking Profile Tab.
    [*] Contract negociations screen has been completly revamped and its new look is very neat. It wasnt bad in any of the previous versios, but these new adjustments are always welcome.
[/list] 

Cons:

[list]
    [*] The only con that I feel I must put out is how the Formation Tactic screen looks like. By this, I mean the players on the pitch in the tactics screen. I feel that player's ""thumbnail"" takes way way too much space than it needs to. This gives me some sort of claustrophobic feeling. This is something that bothers me, but it might not bother anybody else.
[/list]

Now, I didn't write about all the new features that SI has introduced because that's not relevant for this review. I felt like I only need to adress things that need to be adressed considering the game is still in BETA state. This said, I conclude this review by stating that FM16 BETA seems far better than FM15 BETA and I will enjoy every minute of it. I will write a full review after the game comes out in the final version (13 November). By then I will know more. Consider this review, as a review at a glance if you will. Enjoy the best football manager simulator out there.

I also recorded some videos of it, which you can see on my profile/YT channel. | Sigo a seguinte premissa: Não leia Críticas (especializadas ou não), faça a sua própria análise ao jogar. Com tal pensamento, eis que me deparo com mais uma situação incongruente, ou seja, diversas análises negativas (de uma geração ""leite com pêra"" (que sequer jogou o famoso CM)).

Pois bem, FM 2016 está INCRÍVEL! Além de ter corrigido os erros existentes em Football Manager 2015, conseguiu trazer um jogo EXTREMAMENTE leve e fluido. O motor de jogo está sublime. Adiante, quem reclama de ""lesões"" ou ""dificuldade"" é porque, simplesmente, não sabe arrumar o ""staff"", bem como definir um padrão de jogo. Por sinal, não é por acaso que grandes Ligas de Futebol mundo afora têm utilizado a base de dados de Football Manager.. Puts, o jogo está MUITO realista. Muito mesmo! Para quem é fã de futebol, encontrará em FM 2016 um VERDADEIRO simulador onde o ""gerenciar um time"" nunca esteve tão real. Aqui, o manager (você jogador) deve analisar, além de questões técnicas e táticas, a saúde financeira de seu time (buscando sempre equilibrá-lo financeiramente). 

Enfim.. Jogão! Jogão! Jogão! | I would like to preface this by saying a few things: First, I've been playing FM games for about 10 years now, so while I don't have as much experience as others, I'd still say I'm quite familiar with the game.

Secondly, upon reading many of the reviews here (mostly the negative ones), I have to say - a game being ""too hard"" isn't a valid reason to give a negative review; it just means you either don't understand the game, or you're just plain bad at it.

Alright, onto the review. As I've said, I've played this franchise for quite a while now, with thousands of hours pumped into it, and I must say that this is probably the most balanced of them all. I say that for a couple of reasons. First, I don't run away with games against teams I have no business beating. It sounds like a lot of people on here will take a team like Aston Villa and expect to be world beaters, lose to Man Utd, and say ""the game's cheating, I lost."" Look at the real life table and you'll see something shocking! Villa are dead last. You're not meant to win every game all the time. I'm sorry, but you're not - if you did, the game would be broken. 

I find it funny that people come into sim games and expected it to be realistic, but only if you're winning, like you're the best manager in the world. If a real life, qualified, and experienced manager can't get wins, or stay afloat in the top flight, what kind of gall do you have to think you're better than somebody who does it for a living? It's a bit arrogant.

Yes, I understand it's a video game, and that you, as the player, have a hero complex. You've played Mario, you're a fat Italian plumber who's doing acrobatics and crap, killing monsters. Then you play FM and bring that mentality to a sim game, and get pissy when you're garbage. Well, Mario isn't a realistic game is it? We all know Italians can't do anything, let alone save a princess over and over again. ;)

Jokes aside, the positives of this game vastly outweigh the negatives. Another positive to the match engine is the realism in the highlights and game play. In the past I've noticed that in the final 10 minutes or so, teams would dominate you. This was incredibly present in FM15. It didn't seem to matter who the teams were - Spain vs. Malta, didn't matter, Malta would destroy the final ten with nearly 100% possession. Sure, it could be written off as tactics, and player fatigue, and all that, but it was too consistent to be a fluke. This version has none of that. Evenly matched teams seems to have equal spells of possession through the game, which is good. 

There are still some issues with possession mind you. I have found that in the majority of my matches, even against superior teams, I'm dominating the possession and shot game. In fact, it can be a bit ridiculous at times with me having upwards of 75% control over the game. I suppose it's a good problem to have.

Let's take a look at scorelines. Again, in past installments, scores could reach outrageous numbers on a consistent basis. I can't tell you how many times I was apart of 5-3 games. Sure, it happens. But not 15-20 times a season. FM 16 provides more realistic scores, despite the odd possession bias. Most of my games are 1-0, 2-1, etc... I had one 4-0 game. There really isn't much more to say on this other than it seems like it's more realistic.

Defending - oh boy, this has been a personal problem of mine for years in this game. I just don't have the tactical know-how to keep the ball out of my own net, and I like many, ticked it up to a poor ME. This year's version I'm quite pleased with. Either I figured out the defending myself, or the game changed to allow more realistic scorelines. I don't mind losing - it's part of football. But I HATE losing 5-0. It was a turn off for me, and often times I would just quit and not play for a few days because of that. Like I said, save for one game where we scored 4, I haven't seen obnoxious scorelines for seemingly no reason. It's good, I like it.

""But, we've dominated the game, have 30 shots, and lost 1-0. The game is broken."" - Many negative reviews. I suppose these people have never heard of defending/counter attacking. Absolutely that can happen. Look at Chelsea's Champions League win a few years back. They sat in their own end the entire game, and scraped out a win. It's not pretty, but when you're up against a stronger team, it's what you have to do. I feel the AI in this game is better than it has been in years past. Opposition knows when they're up against a stronger team, and they pretty much line up 10 guys at the edge of the box, forcing you to have control and possession, taking bad shots, and frustrating your strikers. All the while, they're sucking your defenders in. Fullbacks get too deep, to try for the wide ball, and central defenders slowly creep forward losing the only striker up front. Next thing ya know, they have a 1-on-1, and you're down 1. You get pissed off and say it's broken. I say, change your tactic. Draw the defense out, so press so much. Etc...

Football is a complex game, and FM 16 is just as complex. If you don't want realistic football, if you want to go and rout your opponents at every turn, play FIFA. Managing a team in a realistic setting is frustrating, but it also has it's rewards. And in this version, I feel that SI has finally nailed down a realistic, fun, and interesting experience. 

There are other aspects I haven't touched upon, like the transfers, UI, and press conferences. But other than the new design, it's all pretty much the same old. The new skin looks alright, takes a bit getting used to, but ya know, you can just get a mod. :) | Грустно конечно это все. Как человеку любящему футбол и играющему еще со времен Championship Manager на сегодняшний ФМ смотреть без содрогания невозможно. В 09 году когда свет увидел первый 3Д, проект казался прорывом. На баги, косяки, несоответствия мной лично закрывались глаза т.к. казалось что ФМ стоит на пороге большего будущего и из года в год будет развиваться и совершенствоваться. Прошел год, еще один, еще....Разработчики мужественно возились с графической частью. ""Колобки"" стали более человекоподобны. Менюшки информативнее, а управление в целом пошло по пути упрощения. Сейчас уже и не вспомнить когда тактическая часть перестала развиваться а когда уже начала деградировать. Реально работавшие командные и индивидуальные тонкие настройки были заменены на более понятные и более примитивные. Относительную сложность и настраиваемость проекта принесли в жертву его популяризации. Как показало время еще хуже дело обстоит с морально устаревшим движком. Если качество картинки с каждым годом постепенно улучшается то содержание того что происходит на экране по сути не меняется уже без малого десяток лет. Не меняется само собой в лучшую сторону.
Нету смысла перечислять все моменты которые выводят из себя игроков, люди долго играющие их все знают, но тот факт что поделать с ними долгие годы ничего не могут говорит о том, что это движок себя полностью исчерпал и ничего стоящего из него уже не выдавить. В 17-ом можно будет порезать навесы вокруг которых строится вся игра ФМ16. Можно будет например ""апнуть"" дриблинг или немного подкрутить игру защитников но сути дела это уже не меняет. Проект не просто перестал развиваться. Он деградирует.
Не так давно пробежался по тематическим форумам с любопытством просматривая какими же игровыми схемами пользуются люди в ФМ 16. Сразу бросился в глаза крайне ограниченный выбор расстановок и еще более урезанный игровых ролей на поле. Фланговые атакующие защитники, инсайды, ложные девятки, форварды отходящие в оборону наше все. Наше безальтернативное все если хотите не просто играть а выигрывать. Еще в 14-ом я совершенно спокойно брал любую команду, и ставил ей ту игру которую от нее хотел видеть. ""Колобки"" на поле благодаря тонкой настройке делали то что я хотел. Не без ошибок, кривизны, багов и пр. но все же можно было поставить игру любой команде и вопрос стоял лишь в количестве времени убитого на эту команду для достижения нужного результата. Сравнивать с ""миром навесов"" от ФМ 16 даже желания никакого не возникает.
п.с. Ну и последним гвоздем в крышку гроба стала тактика которую выложил какой то скучающий от всего этого бездумия товарищ. Как вам господа футбольные гуру расстановочка 2-1-4-3 ? Нет я не ошибся именно так...два центральных защитника, один опорный хав, четыре атакующих хава и три форварда. Какое отношение это имеет к футболу? На мой субъективный никакого а вот человек этой расстановкой совершенно спокойно аутсайдером Серии А берет чемпионат забивая за сезон около 200(!) мячей. Какие еще нужны доказательства несостоятельности этого ""антифутбольного забагованного движка"". 
Ну и в итоге хочется пожалеть об отсутствии кокуренции. Все таки в это болото нужно кидать камни иначе его совсем затянет тиной.

Всем удачи."

Ich kann es kurz machen, denn das Meiste kann man hier überall nachlesen. Ich werde es zwar positiv bewerten, weil es durchaus Spaß macht und nie unfair ist - jedenfalls bis jetzt - ABER es gibt einige Dinge, die mir auf die Nerven gehen und zwei davon ganz besonders:

1. Das völlig überflüssige Kopfgewackel, das beim schnellen Laufen sogar noch eins drauf setzt und mein körperliches Wohlbefinden auf eine verdammt harte Probe stellt - Stichwort 'Motion-Sickness' - und das sich im Menü NICHT abschalten lässt. Menschen, die darunter leiden, sollten die Finger von dem Game lassen.

2. Ich habe in meiner kurzen Spielzeit einige Errungenschaften freigeschaltet (nicht mitgezählt wie viele) aber es waren mehr als drei oder vier. Angezeigt wird hier nur Eine. Das nervt. Mir ist alleine deshalb schon die Lust am Weiterspielen vergangen, weil ich da eigentlich mit 100% durch wollte.

Technisch ist es ansonsten OK, es läuft flüssig, die Steuerung ist etwas zu träge für meinen Geschmack und manchmal geht ein Fußtritt mitten durch, ohne Schaden anzurichten, weil man einfach zu dicht am Gegner steht. Ecken und Winkel, die man gerade noch befreit hatte, damit man keine Gegner im Rücken hat und man sich mit dem Haufen vor einem in Ruhe beschäftigen kann - könnt ihr nicht immer aber oft vergessen, weil die spawnen trotzdem aus heiterem Himmel direkt hinter euch, wo gerade noch alles leer und ""gesäubert"" war. Keine Ahnung, wo die dann plötzlich herkommen aber anscheinend direkt aus dem Nirvana... Ziemlich bekloppt.

Spielerisch ist es aufgrund mangelnder Abwechslung und gewisser Eintönigkeit mit 'Dying Light' (1) vergleichbar, und bitte - ich weiß, dass die Fan-Gemeinde für den ersten Teil extrem groß ist und ihr jetzt bei dieser Bemerkung Schnappatmung bekommt - aber es hat keinen Zweck, mir den Kopf abzubeißen, denn mir hat der erste Teil trotzdem nicht annähernd so gut gefallen, wie der Zweite. Das sieht eben jeder/jede anders.

Wenn ihr wirklich ein Zombie-Spiel haben wollt, wo alles passt, dann solltet ihr euch mal 'Dying Light 2' wenigstens mal ansehn, das Studio ist das Selbe. Das ist um Längen besser als das hier und sehr viel interessanter. Dort wurde eigentlich an alles gedacht, was ich hier vermisse. Menüeinstellungen - ALLES da, Steuerung perfekt und direkt, Story - ist gut und gar nicht mal so übel, gute und anspruchsvolle Nebenquests (die Meisten jedenfalls), Adrenalin pur und richtig gutes Gameplay mit guter Optik.

Ich werde das hier jetzt erstmal wieder deinstallieren, denn trotz einigem Spielspaß schafft 'Dead Island Definitive Edition' es nicht, mich mitzunehmen.

Вся игра,это выполнение просьб,принеси мне 3 гвоздя,принеси мне топливо,принеси еще что-нибудь. При этом НПС вообще никак не оживляют мир,они буквально стоят все время на одном месте.

А под конец очень сильно бросается в глаза нехватка бюджета,где тебя заставляют бегать по одним и тем же локациям.
А еще переиздание имеет кучу багов,как с оригинальной игры,так и приобретенные новые. Такие как провалы в текстуры,застревание в предметах,смерть просто потому что, и вылеты из игры. | Pros:
- Visual Improvements: The game has received a significant graphical upgrade, with enhanced textures, environmental objects, and lighting effects that make the world feel more immersive.

- Content: The Definitive Edition includes both Dead Island and Dead Island: Riptide, along with all the DLC, offering a lot of content for players.

- Quality of Life Improvements: The game features several quality-of-life improvements, such as better inventory management and additional gameplay tweaks that make the experience smoother.

Cons:
- Performance Issues: Despite the visual improvements, the game still struggles with performance, particularly with frame rate drops and occasional bugs.

- Outdated Mechanics: Some of the core gameplay mechanics feel dated and repetitive, which might not appeal to everyone.

- Mixed Reactions to Changes: While many improvements were made, some changes, like altered weapon models and textures, have received mixed feedback from players who were nostalgic about the original versions.

Overall, Dead Island: Definitive Edition offers a lot of content and visual enhancements, but it still has some performance and gameplay issues that might not be for everyone.

I remember trying it back in the day and not vibing with it. Now that I'm a bit older, I really like what this game has done. In a time when everything was so heavily focused on guns it makes guns practically useless. The melee has a lot of weight to it that not many games from the time did. There are certainly aspects I wish were improved but taking everything at face value I have to say this is a fairly unique experience.

It has a few flaws: Firstly, notes taking up RAM, let alone a lot of RAM. I sort of get what the devs were going for here, but all it does is encourage the player to pull  up a notepad on their second monitor, especially in the endgame when you need to juggle passwords and IP addresses for upwards of a dozen machines. Secondly, the node map. It's a cool concept but its insanely cluttered and unusable, to the point where the DLC gives you a way to sort it, so the devs know its a problem. but you just have to deal with it until you beat the dlc (intended to be played late in the main story)

Beyond those flaws though, it's a very good little hacking game.

At first, the game bombards you with a ton of non-skippable events, missions, messages.

Some missions are just crazy difficult, like those for Serpent King and Mad AI factory, and you don't expect this difficulty this early in the game.
Mid-game you finally have a chance to catch some breath and start working on some research, building and engineering, but here's the catch: the moment you get better in the game, the moment you upgrade your weapons and armour, the enemies suddenly become more powerful and armoured. You just don't have a chance to enjoy powerful things that you've made, because they quickly become just what is expected by default.
The end game comes unexpectedly, with a lot of pressure on you. It consists of two consecutive missions with no pause in between. If you got some units damaged in the first mission, you either will have to replace your best units or send them in wounded. The final mission is crazy, the amount of extremely powerful enemies is over the top, and it carries a lot of stress.

以上を大前提とした上で、そう⋯700時間以上もプレイ（最高難易度を最小部隊人数でクリア済）した上で私個人の見解を言わせてもらうと
XCOM:EUよりもゲーム性（ゲームとしての楽しさの意）は落ちてしまったと感じる
XCOM:EUはXCOM2よりも飽きの来る要素が多いはずなのに⋯だ！
※EUでは敵の配置が一部完全固定だったり⋯etc

繰り返し遊ぶゲームとしてみるとXCOM2の方が優秀なはずである
ではなぜ私はXCOM:EUの方がゲーム性が高いと言えるのか？
XCOM:EUのゲーム性はまるでパワプロなのだ
パワプロもメインイベントは決まった日に起こるはずなのに、何度もプレイしても楽しい

XCOM:EUではストーリーの進行と、ミッションが適切な間隔で詰まっており
兵士の計画的な育成（＝ビルドを組む楽しさ）と、時間制限（＝敵の更新／強化）
のバランスがすごい良かったのだ
そしてランダム性が少ないことが→上手くなれば、あらゆる要素を縛っても戦術で勝てる
など良い方向に働いたりした

一方でXCOM2では、多くの追加要素により楽しさも増したが、
その分ストーリーとミッションの関連性が薄れ、またタイムリミット枠の選ばれし者たちの介入は、
戦闘を長引かせる良くない要素の一つだと思う
選ばれし者自体はすごく面白いのだが、3人は多い！ゲームのかさ増しになってしまってる

ストーリーとレジスタンスの尻拭いを交互にやらされるのも間延びする原因だ
XCOM:EUでは助ける国と、見捨てる国の切り分けも緊張感を煽る良いスパイスだった
XCOM:EUでの上手くなるは「ゲームオーバーにならなければ見捨てて/切り捨ててOK」だった
XCOM2では上手くなると「滅亡カウンターがやばくなってきたから、そろそろ助けに行くか～」と、どの難易度でもなった
侵略されてXCOM:EUより悲惨なはずなのに、なんか緊張感にかけるのである
追加要素をプレイさせるために、滅亡までの時間にどうしても猶予が出来てしまったためだ
この点がゲーム性がXCOM:EUより落ちてしまったと感じる部分だ

難易度が上がると、どんどん無駄を減らすプレイングが重要で、駆け抜けるようなゲームプレイ感になるXCOM:EUと
研究や勢力や選ばれし者など、たくさんの要素からどっしり構えて戦略を練っていくXCOM2とプレイ感が違う

[/olist]

Причем, 1 и 2 цель всегда завершают уровень и не могут быть на одном уровне одновременно.

Также в игре есть 3 типа врагов (охранник, бегун, снайпер). На самом деле их больше, но они очень схожи по своим паттернам. 

По итогу комбинация целей, врагов и маршрутов дают нам головоломку для решения уровня. К сожалению, иногда последовательность решения может существовать только одна, что для головоломки - не очень хороший показатель.

Игра вываливает на тебя чуть больше сотни уровней, которые прячутся за 8 коробками (этапами), где каждый этап дает новые механики.

Игра идеальна для Steam Deck, я играл в нее перед сном по 30 минут, за это время можно смело пройти 1 этап. И пусть вас не смущает отсутствие английского языка, тут из английского слов 30 на всю игру))))

Так же, не могу не отметить относительную легкость достижений. Поскольку игра пошаговая, сложных достижений нет (если гуглить). Но есть неинтересные - это фарм убийств, прохождение всех уровней на 3 звезды и нельзя использовать подсказки, иначе запорите достижение и придется начинать все заново.

По итогу, как игру для дека могу рекомендовать, проходится за пару вечеров, выглядит атмосферно и играется неплохо.

P.S. Если вы как я, решили что есть настольная игра (по мотивам которой и сделали Hitman GO), то увы это не так, просто игра сделана как настолка. И на моей памяти это впервые, обычно настолки переносят в цифру, а тут сделали настолку в цифре без настолки. 
 | It is a fine game, but has a few major flaws; the first being broken achievements. In my 7 hours of
playtime, I could only get 6 achievements, and the rest simply refused to unlock. This makes hundred
percenting the game irrelevant.
My other complaint comes from how the objective system works. Hundred percenting a level requires
you to do two optional objectives. The problem is that the level design only allows you to complete one
at a time, forcing you to play the same level twice, only in a slightly different manner. This made the
game infinitely more boring for me, so much so that I stopped perfecting it altogether, making my
experience much more enjoyable. Incentivising replayability can work for a mainline Hitman game,
where tonnes of content is available to explore, keeping each replay fresh and interesting. But, forcing
players to replay levels from a board game which is already so linear, was a step in the wrong direction.
I think the worst type of objectives were ""complete the game in x turn or less"". They turned the
experience into a slog. In addition to this, the game does not even show how many turn you have made
in a level, making these challenges even more annoying. Providing this information would have turned
them much more tolerable.
The missions where you could complete all the objectives in one go were actually fun, and the entire
game should have been like this. Coincidentally, these levels also did not contain that aforementioned
""x turns or less"" challenge. Another minor criticism I have is that you have to manually check the
objectives in a level by going to the menu. I would have preferred if they were directly displayed on the
screen, or at the beginning of each level.
I know that the I sound extremely negative in my review. But, most of my problems are only relevant if
you are looking forward to hundred percenting the game. If you do not care about that, it just ""clicks"",
especially its sound effects. They add so much to the experience, and it would have been a somewhat of
an inferior product if not for them. Every action is punctuated with so much weight, that you can
almost forget for a moment that you are not actually killing people. The music too, while used
sparingly, fits the tone of the experience. | Bueno, complejo, menos de 10h de gameplay, lamentablemente no tiene un buen soundtrack y carece de sonidos, en pocas palabras, es como jugar ajedrez con skins. | Não procure as respostas no google.

 | The game also comes with a DLC, which includes the following items:

1. A Toxic Community: Mistakes are rarely forgiven. Unless you’re playing with friends, be prepared to face harsh criticism, often from younger players. The game’s multiplayer is largely populated by school-aged players who don’t hold back.


2. Disruptive Adults: It’s not just the kids causing chaos—some adults blast music through their microphones, assuming everyone else shares their taste. Spoiler: they don’t.


3. Frequent AFKs: Teamwork can fall apart when a teammate goes inactive, whether they’re brewing tea, taking a smoke break, or simply wandering off mid-game. And yes, it often happens right after you’ve generously used your first aid kit on them.


4. Team Abandonment: Lone wolves running off to the far corners of the map, only to be overwhelmed by infected, are a common sight. They’re quick to flood the chat with colorful language before rage-quitting the game.


5. Difficulty Disputes: Some players join games on ""Expert"" difficulty only to demand a downgrade. If their request is denied, they might sabotage the team before leaving the server entirely.


6. Vote Kicks: Occasionally, you’ll encounter players who inexplicably start a vote to kick you from the game. When you ask why? Crickets.



The Verdict: Despite the chaotic community, Left 4 Dead 2 remains a phenomenal experience. The graphics are a significant step up from the first game, the mechanics feel more polished, and there’s a greater variety of weapons and infected to enjoy. However, surviving the online experience without a calming remedy might be just as challenging as surviving the zombie apocalypse itself. | Крутая игра для игры с друзьями (которые в это не играют)!

Featuring intense survival gameplay, smart AI, and an incredible atmosphere, L4D2 delivers an unmatched multiplayer experience. With its fast-paced action, diverse weapons, and unpredictable enemy encounters, this game remains one of the most thrilling and replayable co-op shooters ever made.

Gameplay – Pure, Adrenaline-Fueled Action
L4D2 is all about co-op survival. You and three teammates must fight through hordes of the undead, navigating through various maps and completing objectives to reach safety. The key to survival? Teamwork, strategy, and adaptability.

The gunplay is tight and satisfying, with a wide selection of weapons including assault rifles, shotguns, SMGs, sniper rifles, and melee weapons like axes, katanas, and even frying pans! Every encounter feels dynamic, thanks to the AI Director, which adjusts the difficulty based on your team’s performance, ensuring no two playthroughs are ever the same.

Special Infected – Enemies That Keep You on Edge
Beyond the standard zombie horde, L4D2 introduces Special Infected that force players to work together:

Tank – A massive brute that can throw debris and crush survivors.
Witch – A terrifying enemy that, if startled, can instantly incapacitate a survivor.
Smoker – Uses a long tongue to drag players away from their team.
Hunter – A fast, agile infected that pounces on survivors and pins them down.
Boomer – Explodes in a shower of bile, attracting a massive horde.
Charger – Charges through groups, slamming a survivor into the ground.
Spitter – Creates pools of acid that deal heavy damage.
Each Special Infected forces different team strategies, making communication and positioning absolutely crucial.

Campaigns & Maps – A Horror Movie Experience
L4D2 features multiple campaigns, each set in diverse, apocalyptic locations across the southern U.S.:

Dead Center – A chaotic mall escape reminiscent of classic zombie films.
The Parish – A tense race across New Orleans to reach an evacuation zone.
Swamp Fever – A creepy, foggy swamp filled with infected dangers.
Hard Rain – A unique campaign featuring a devastating hurricane that changes the environment.
Dark Carnival – A fan-favorite, featuring a deadly amusement park with a thrilling rollercoaster finale.
Each campaign feels like a mini zombie movie, packed with cinematic set pieces, interactive environments, and intense finales.

Multiplayer & Game Modes – Endless Replayability
L4D2 offers several game modes that keep the action fresh:

Campaign Mode – Classic co-op survival through story-driven levels.
Versus Mode – One team plays as survivors, while the other controls the Special Infected.
Survival Mode – See how long you can last against endless waves of zombies.
Scavenge Mode – A competitive mode where teams race to collect fuel cans while being hunted.
Mutation Mode – Weekly game modifiers that add fun twists to gameplay.
Thanks to modding support and the Steam Workshop, the community has also created hundreds of custom maps, weapons, and campaigns, making L4D2’s replayability practically infinite.

Graphics & Sound – Immersive and Timeless
Even years after release, L4D2’s atmospheric lighting, detailed environments, and gruesome effects hold up well. Zombies react realistically to gunfire, and the sound design is masterful, with eerie background noises, terrifying growls from Special Infected, and intense musical cues that heighten the suspense.

The voice acting and character interactions bring the survivors to life, making them memorable and adding humor to the chaos.

Why Left 4 Dead 2 is a Must-Play
L4D2 is the perfect blend of action, horror, and co-op gameplay. Whether you’re playing with friends or AI teammates, the intense combat, unpredictable enemy encounters, and endless replayability make every match a thrilling adventure.

🔹 Final Rating: 10/10
Left 4 Dead 2 is a masterpiece of cooperative gaming. If you love zombies, action, and teamwork, this is an absolute must-play that still delivers endless fun and excitement after more than a decade.

Lo estoy rejugando ahora y a pesar de sus muchos problemas la diversidad y diferencia entre facciones es muy buena, cada una funciona muy diferente.

Pero las unidades de por si y la estetica (de las unidades, las estructuras estan bien) se siente muy generica.

Ahora por fin tras 15 años, voy a probar la expansion, y justo me di cuenta de que la expansion da totalmente una nueva faccion, aun no la he probado pero por lo que he leido es otro estilo completamente original.

Otra parte quizas buena quizas mala dependiendo de tus gustos, es el hecho de que al parecer gastaron mucho presupuesto en los graficos cgi y escenas de dialogo entre misiones. A mi personalmente me hubiese gustado mas menos dinero ahi pero mas original.

En resumen: Juego genial, que quizas te tienen que forzar en las primeras misiones dado que el argumento parece generico pero hay un twist y mejora muchisimo personalmente.

PROS:
-Gran variedad entre facciones (Cada una funciona completamente distinta)
-Graficos (Para tener 10años el juego aun luce muy bien)
-Originalidad en la idea de la historia

Cons:
-Casi todas las unidades se ven aburridas y/o muy pequeñas para el detalle.
-Historia empieza muy floja, realmente muy floja.
-Comunidad para partidas online inexistente (aunque la campaña da mucho contenido que disfrutar)

Para mi el juego ha valido la pena, y ojala hubiese tenido exito, me gustaria RTS mas parecidos con mas diferencia entre facciones. | Unresponsive, slow and unnecessarily complicated gameplay. Doesn't really feel like a RTS | story gut, UI bisl arg groß ^^ | was pretty fun"
76561197974286855,281640,The Banner Saga 2,2.6666666666666665,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",1,"Круто! Очень интересное продолжение, виден рост в анимации, интересные сюжетные повороты. Сюжет пробивает на эмоции, как и первая часть, так держать! Графика и музыка на высоте, всё также захватывают. 
Понравились эмоции персонажей, новые части в сражении. Однозначно рекомендую! ♥ | Ворвавшись во вторую часть, я с ходу расшиб себе лоб о нововведение: испытания. Первое же испытание вынуждает нас познать боль и страдание случайностей, ведь нам нужно с одного AoE удара поразить трёх противников, которые должны примыкать друг к другу. Разработчики желают нам удачи в убеждении противников выстроиться «три в ряд», сидя за пуленепробиваемым стеклом, ведь они не могли не понимать, что ничего кроме желания их удушить подобные задания не могут вызывать? Я даже думал бросить с ходу, но внутренний мазохист победил, и, вооружившись артефактом +2 AGGRO и перезапустив испытание раз 10–15, я таки его одолел. 

И хорошо, что одолел, потому что испытания дают много renown, но знайте, что, хотя большая часть испытаний проходится довольно просто, проблемные ещё будут. К примеру, было испытание, где надо с помощью «Arc Lightning» поразить трёх противников. Снова веселье с «убеждением» противника, но мне один раз повезло, и на старте доброжелательный противник выстроился аккурат как мне надо. Каково же было моё удивление, когда задание не выполнилось после того, как я лупанул туда молнию. Потом лупанул вторую, и все трое умерли, но задание продолжило висеть! Забагованное #&*%$! Выполнить удалось лишь тогда, когда они выстроились после череды перемещений. 

Раздражающих нововведений я больше не встретил, но встретил бесполезные: баррикады. Я их даже в каких-то боях видел, но не видел ни разу, чтобы они хоть на что-то влияли. Абсолютно бесполезная ерунда. Другим сомнительным нововведением для меня стали таланты: их абсолютно неинтересно улучшать. Если я поднимал силу, то мой герой становился сильнее, тут я процентики туда-сюда добавляю — скучно. Вообще, прокачивать героев после 6 уровня совершенно неинтересно. А таланты можно вообще считать вредными, потому что они очень сильно влияют на восприятие боя. Если без них бой был строго определён: ты получал ровно то, что видел, то теперь туда влили кучу случайности, отсутствие которой, на мой взгляд, положительно выделяло боевую систему BS в первой части. 

Добавили много новых героев, у которых много разных новых способностей, что было несколько ошеломляюще поначалу, потому что глаза разбегались: кого в бой брать, почему, а что этот делает, а вот этот? Я ничего против новых героев не имею, но было бы куда лучше вводить их постепенно, а не вываливать на тебя пачками. Помогло то, что разработчики насильно разделили отряд на два и вынудили тебя использовать новых героев (учитывая, что то же самое они провернули в первой части, ничего лучше они придумать, похоже, не могут). 

Кстати, забавный момент с новой способностью. Способность Bolverk «Cull the Weak» у меня зачастую выдавала не тот результат, который я от неё ожидал. Т. е. урона было меньше, чем я предполагал. Я так до конца игры и не понял, в чём дело, и только после игры я нашёл на форуме такого же бедолагу, которому объяснили, что для применения способности третьего ранга ты должен использовать 3 willpower! Я прошёл две игры и не знал основы основ, я считал, что открытый с уровнем ранг замещает способность, и даже не догадывался, что я должен каждый раз платить за нужный мне ранг способности. Допускаю, что я где-то в обучении в первой части упустил этот момент, но как же, блин, это неинтуитивно! И таких моментов в игре, кстати, хватает. Нужно форумы штудировать, чтобы разобраться. 

Но можно и не разбираться, потому что игра не сложная. А вторая её часть ещё и проще первой. Причём значительно. У тебя убер-бойцы, ты ходишь и всех размазываешь, пока плебеи за едой ходят (я еду купил один раз в начале). Но играть всё-таки весело, равно как и интересно смотреть за развитием сюжета. По крайней мере один раз. Поэтому, несмотря на мой негатив выше, это всё ещё положительный отзыв. 

P. S. Разработчики в конце дают выбор без выбора. Как можно работать с отвратительным ублюдком по имени Rugga? За отсутствие возможности отрезать ему башку ставлю жирный минус. | Great story, interesting battle. Amazing game | Still my favorite game trilogy ever.

The story, the art, the gameplay, I love it all. | Внедрение новых фич в прокачку, меняющая стиль игры за героя, караван теперь может приносить пользу, докрученный интерфейс - отличие от первой части и определенно в лучшую сторону. Однако есть нерабочие костыли - войны, преграды, которые не дают никакого стратегического преимущества (враг на них чихать хотел и никогда в жизни не додумается сломать, а тыкать через них копейщакми или лучниками такое себе развлечение).
И всё-таки это уже игра не только с красивым визуалом и интересной историей, но и достойной боёвкой"

[quote][i]Всем привет. Автор не несет ответственности за причиненный вред своими обзорами. Любое сходство с другими обзорами случайно. Данный обзор является лишь мнением автора и вы можете всегда оставаться при своем мнении! Спасибо за понимание и приятной игры![/i][/quote]

[h1]Описание:[/h1]
[i][b]Stellaris[/b] — это смесь грандиозной 4X-стратегии, ролевой игры и интерактивного романа, где вы сами пишете историю своего народа среди звёзд. Разработчики создали  эпическое повествование о взлётах и падениях цивилизации. От первых робких шагов в космосе до управления межгалактической империей — здесь есть место всему: дипломатии, войнам, предательствам и открытиям, которые перевернут ваше представление о жанре.[/i]

[b]Основа игры: Механики, которые затягивают на сотни часов[/b]
[i][list]
[*] [b]Создание своей цивилизации:[/b] Stellaris начинается с того, что вы буквально конструируете расу из десятков параметров: этика (милитаристы, пацифисты, ксенофобы), тип общества (биологическое, роботы, псионики), черты (адаптивность, интеллект, агрессия) и даже внешность. Хотите играть за миролюбивых космических слизней, строящих галактическую федерацию? Или за машинную империю, стремящуюся ассимилировать все органические расы? Здесь возможно всё.

[*] [b]Исследование и открытия:[/b] Галактика в Stellaris генерируется случайно, и каждое новое игра — это путешествие в неизвестность. Вы будете:
- Исследовать аномалии (например, древние руины или гравитационные аномалии).
- Встречать кризисы (вторжение внегалактических захватчиков, восстание синтетиков).
- Заключать союзы или уничтожать соседей.

[*] [b]Дипломатия и войны:[/b] 
- Дипломатия: От торговых соглашений до создания федераций — здесь можно решать судьбы галактики без единого выстрела.
- Войны: Система военных целей позволяет вести не тотальные войны, а конфликты с чёткими задачами (захват системы, освобождение вассала).
- Шпионаж и провокации: Саботаж, кража технологий, поддержка повстанцев — идеально для любителей «тихих» конфликтов.

[*] [b]Экономика и управление:[/b] 
- Балансировка ресурсов (энергия, минералы, пища, потребительские товары) — основа процветания.
- Планирование заселения планет, строительство мегасооружений (кольцевые миры, сферы Дайсона) и управление населением с уникальными потребностями.
[/list][/i]

[i][b]Сильные стороны: Почему Stellaris покоряет сердца[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]Нарративная глубина:[/b] События в игре — это не просто текст, а истории с последствиями. Например, обнаружение «Храмового комплекса» может привести к пробуждению древнего бога-червя, который переформатирует вашу расу, или к гибели всего живого в секторе.

[*] [b]Реиграбельность:[/b] Благодаря случайной генерации галактики, сотням событий и возможности создавать уникальные цивилизации, каждая партия кардинально отличается от предыдущей.

[*] [b]Моддерская поддержка:[/b] Stellaris обладает одной из самых активных моддерских сообществ. Моды добавляют новые расы, сюжеты, механики и даже полностью меняют сеттинг.

[*] [b]Постоянное развитие:[/b] Paradox регулярно обновляет игру, исправляя ошибки и добавляя новые фичи. Даже спустя 7 лет после релиза Stellaris остаётся актуальной.
[/list][/i]

[h1]Плюсы:[/h1]
[i][list]
[*] [b]Беспрецедентная свобода творчества:[/b] Создавайте уникальные расы с собственной этикой, чертами и историей. Хотите играть за пацифистов-грибов или машин-уничтожителей? Всё возможно. Проработанная система происхождений (например, «Потерянная колония» или «Синтетическая эволюция») задаёт тон всей партии.

[*] [b]Нарративная глубина:[/b] Сотни случайных событий, археологических цепочек и кризисов превращают игру в космическую сагу. Истории в духе научной фантастики: от восстания ИИ до встречи с божественными червями.

[*] [b]Реиграбельность:[/b] Случайная генерация галактики, разные типы кризисов (вторжение Пожирателей, Восстание машин) и бесконечные комбинации рас обеспечивают уникальность каждой партии.

[*] [b]Дипломатия и взаимодействие:[/b] От создания федераций до подрывных операций — здесь есть инструменты для любой стратегии. Возможность играть без войн, побеждая через культурное доминирование или политические интриги.

[*] [b]Моддерская поддержка:[/b] Огромная библиотека модов: от новых рас и кораблей до полных переработок вселенной (например, «Star Trek» или «Warhammer 40K»).

[*] [b]Атмосферность:[/b] Эпичный саундтрек, стилистика кораблей и планет, голосовые оповещения — всё это погружает в атмосферу живой галактики.

[*] [b]Постоянное развитие:[/b] Paradox регулярно обновляет игру, добавляя новые механики и исправляя ошибки.

[*] [b]Достижения:[/b] Присутствие получения различных достижений, что добавляет элемент соревновательности и мотивации с другими игроками которые смогли получить сложные достижения с особыми условиями.

[*] [b]Коллекционные предметы:[/b] Присутствуют обои, смайлики, карточки из которых можно скрафтить значки
[/list][/i]

[h1]Минусы:[/h1]
[i][list]
[*] [b]Высокий порог вхождения:[/b] Десятки ресурсов, технологий и механик могут перегрузить новичков. Обучение в игре поверхностное.

[*] [b]Проблемы с оптимизацией:[/b] На поздних стадиях игра начинает лагать, особенно в больших галактиках. Мультиплеер часто страдает от десинхронизации.

[*] [b]Дисбаланс механик:[/b] Некоторые стратегии (например, спам роботами или «танкирование» инфляции) остаются неоправданно сильными. ИИ часто действует нелогично: мирные империи внезапно объявляют войны, а ксенофобы предлагают союзы.

[*] [b]Повторяемость:[/b] После 100+ часов цепочки событий и диалоги начинают повторяться. Кризисы следуют одним и тем же сценариям.

[*] [b]Зависимость от DLC:[/b] Без дополнений (например, Utopia или Apocalypse) игра ощущается неполной. Многие «крутые» фичи (кольцевые миры, титаны) locked за платными DLC.

[*] [b]Ограниченная роль личности:[/b] Лидеры и фракции слабо влияют на игру. Их смерть или смена редко меняют курс империи.
[/list][/i]

[h1]Заключение:[/h1]
[i]Stellaris — это не просто игра. Это симулятор бесконечности, где каждая звезда может стать домом для новой цивилизации, а каждый чёрный ящик — хранить секреты, способные изменить галактику. Да, здесь есть проблемы с балансом и оптимизацией, но когда ваш флот из тысяч кораблей вступает в бой с внегалактическими захватчиками под эпичную музыку, вы понимаете: это не просто код и спрайты. Это — настоящее космическое приключение.[/i]

Frequently this game goes on sale for like 75% and the base game alone is not worth the price tag especially as a lot of features that most Stellaris players like messing with are behind DLCs so unless there's some part of the game that you're desperate to play with I'd get the base game and any interesting DLC while they're on sale. | 肥肠好的游戏，使我的巨像旋转，之前玩的盗版，现在终于史低补票（仅本体）了，但P社的DLC是真贵，只能用学习版，等有钱了慢慢补票吧。 | So this is exactly the type of multiple month game time negative review that gets screen shot and memed on social media, but I'm sad to say I mean it in the most literal sense.  I have enjoyed much of my play time with Stellaris, but I emphatically don't recommend anyone purchase this game in it's current, maximum DLC form.
When this game launched, it was a refreshingly basic 4X. Most of the changes made in the early years all the way to the Nemesis expansion added meaningfully to the gameplay without making it overwhelming and complicated for new players.  Unfortunately recent patches and expansions have unfortunately been hats on hats, mostly adding complexity without adding fun.  I have enjoyed the ride for the most part, but like most Paradox games the continual addition of DLC eventually replaces the game you loved with something you barely recognize while draining your wallet."

You build your base near good resources and then pray one of the bots won't claim those resources away from you.

Add the fact that this game balances the difficulty by giving the bots higher stats (thus making the bot always pick resources to claim before you) and you get a game where you can loose within first 5 minutes of the game with no way of preventing it nor fighting back.
After you survive your first 5 minutes, next you have to sell resources, hoping that the RNG will decide that the resource that you are producing is going to be worth anything.

Cheating AI to compensate for being bit dumb is common practice in RTS games, but apparently the devs think that their AI is stupid beyond any redemption so they juiced all the cheating levers to the moon and the only thing that remains is artificial difficulty in the most boring and tedious way.

Raiding/attacking an AI is absolutely pointless unless you can actually destroy their main base. They're barely relying on population for their production and any villagers/military units you kill respawn almost instantly anyway so it's absolutely pointless to raid them.

The issue seemed a bit less apparent during the Campaign, so at least that part was bit better balanced. But trying out Conquest mode afterwards is just absolutely disgusting. It's doable, but an absolute drag cause it requires constant micromanagement to barely compensate for all the AI cheating. And even then it takes so long to finish off an opponent because raiding an AI does barely anything, so unless you're way way stronger the AI will just bounce back in the blink of an eye.

Bit of cheating would be fine, but I mean the AI units literally respawn like 2-3+ times faster, and their armies have barely any upkeep so it doesn't matter if you destroy their economy cause they will just field an army of 15+ units without any economy supporting them anyway. It's just a joke imo, this is not an actual challenge.

Please put some actual thought and at least a little bit of effort into your AI so the cheating doesn't have to be so blatantly in your face. 

It's a shame, cause the base game mechanics are interesting enough, the game looks nice visually and has a good theme. The campaign is decent and multiplayer might be fine, but beyond that the AI is a hot broken mess preventing you from having any fun. | Стратегия неплохая, особенно с друзьями, но отдельные кланы за 200 рублей каждый и сама игра которая стоит 1100 это конечно писдец.
 | Muy buen juego. La verdad desde que lo empece a jugar me dejo enganchado. Me gusta la dinámica que tiene. Tiene su nivel de dificultad, su banda sonora es muy bueno. El gameplay es muy sencillo, parecido al Age Of Empires. La duración de cada partida puede llegar hasta una hora pero vale la pena cada partida. Las diferentes estaciones hacen que tomes decisiones que ayuden a tu pueblo, ya que si tienen hambre, poca felicidad o están enfermos pueden ser un problema. Recomendado. | The amount of time I've put into this game is not a reflection of the quality of the game. It's a reflection of the very slow pace, and very steep learning curve. Basically, the first 30 minutes of any game, you're entirely on your own. You're competing against the elements, and trying to build up your colony. But then you encounter an opponent, and it becomes IMMEDIATELY clear if you did well to prepare for their invasion. Either you get steamrolled, or you do the steamrolling. There is not much exciting back and forth in this game, and it takes way too much time to get the repetitions in to figure out how to build up your base effectively. | Keep crashing on the Victory Screen.

З негативного на мій погляд - викривлення певних історичних контекстів. Простежується культурна апропріація.

 Дуже нериємно це бачити, особливо в умовах, коли росія щодня знищує наші міста в реальності...

 | Нові стратегічні рішення та чудова графіка.
Але важко уявити, що в 2025 році ми все ще змушені бачити у світі ігор проросійські наративи. У новій версії гри розробники ""відзначилися"" черговим ігноруванням української локалізації та повного ігнорування української нації, яка переживає героїчну боротьбу за своє існування та незалежність.  

Анонс нового персонажа, цариці-душогубки, яка нав'язується як ""символ культури та просвітництва"", виглядає як зневага до мільйонів українців. Героізація імперіалістичної постаті — це не тільки обурливо, але й аморально в контексті війни та окупації, яку сьогодні переживає наша країна.

It's hard to believe that in 2025 we are still witnessing pro-Russian narratives in the gaming industry. In the latest version of the game, the developers once again ignored Ukrainian localization and completely erased the Ukrainian nation, which is heroically fighting for its survival and independence.  

The announcement of a new character, a tsarina-murderer being portrayed as a ""symbol of culture and enlightenment,"" is a slap in the face to millions of Ukrainians. Glorifying an imperialist figure is not only outrageous but also immoral in the context of the war and occupation Ukraine is enduring today.

	Очень простая идея игры, что игрок в роли короля старается править своим государством в максимально упрощённом стиле. Перед вами буквально меняются карты с людьми и их просьбами, которые можно только сбрасывать вправо или влево. От чего меняются параметры королевства. Всего их доступно 4: церковь, народ, армия и казна. При достижении одного в пороге максимум или минимум король умирает или изгоняется. Мда, правь хорошо и всё равно убьют! Задумано, что требуется держать все параметры приблизительно посередине. 

	Кроме правления есть мини игра по фехтованию в которой местами победить легко или сложно. Атака/защита продвигает персонажей вперед/назад от чего происходит движение по полю с клетками. Оказавшийся за краем погибает. Да, все действия принимаются исходя из выбранного ответа, который вы дадите карточке.

	Самое интересное происходит, когда удаётся вмешаться в конфликт, что слегка изменит местоположение игры и добавит новых карт болтунов. Изредка можно нарваться и на мощные бонусы. Например, высокая стена, что не позволит вашей армии опуститься ниже 0 или центральный банк, что возьмёт на себя часть трат из казны. Таких при себе возможно иметь только 4 штуки.

	К сожалению после часа игры вы столкнётесь с постоянными одинаковыми диалогами, ответы на которые уже известны. Да, в игре есть часть диалогов, где будет по факту один ответ. До конца доживут не многие, ведь предстоит дожить до 2000 года, когда и возможно получить 2 из 3 концовок в зависимости от ответа. Для достижения такого момента предстоит играть ну часа 4 наверное. Игра на первом получасе показывает всё что может предложить.

	Графика у игры простая, что и на первых смартфонах бы работало. Музыка достаточно приятная и простая.

76561197974286855,475550,Beholder,1.05,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy",1,"Beholder is an absolute gem for anyone who enjoys thought-provoking games that challenge your ethics and decision-making skills. Set in a dystopian world where you play as a landlord tasked with spying on tenants for a totalitarian government, the game artfully combines strategy, storytelling, and morality in a way that few games manage to achieve.

From the moment you step into the grim, oppressive atmosphere of the apartment building, the game immerses you in its richly detailed world. The art style is stunningly minimalist, with a dark aesthetic that perfectly complements the oppressive tone of the story. The haunting music and sound design further pull you into the game's bleak reality.

Gameplay Highlights:

Engaging Decisions: Every choice you make matters. Do you report a tenant for illegal activity to protect your family, or do you turn a blind eye and risk your position? The moral dilemmas are intense and often heart-wrenching.
Strategic Gameplay: Managing resources, time, and relationships adds a layer of complexity that keeps you on your toes. Balancing the demands of the government, your tenants, and your own family is no small feat.
Dynamic Storytelling: The branching narrative and multiple endings provide excellent replay value. Each playthrough feels unique, encouraging you to explore different paths and outcomes.
Why It Stands Out: What sets Beholder apart is its ability to make you reflect on your own morality. It's not just about winning or completing tasks—it's about what kind of person you choose to be in an unforgiving world. Few games strike such a perfect balance between strategy and storytelling, making every moment impactful.

Verdict: Beholder is a must-play for fans of strategy, narrative-driven games, or dystopian settings. It’s a unique experience that lingers in your mind long after you’ve put down the controller. I can’t recommend it enough—if you’re ready for a game that challenges both your mind and your conscience, Beholder is the perfect choice.

 | It`s quite a shattering game, which emotional impact keeps player`s attention at high rate (and not only because it is about spying).

Könnte ich meine Erinnerung an das Game löschen und es nochmal spielen, würd ichs tun. | When my only real complaint is why isn't there more, that's not really a problem. The fact the writing and score make a text-based story compelling and chilling enough to keep me glued to my seat shows how well written this game is. | Allora, innanzitutto va detto che il gioco è solamente testuale (molta roba da leggere, sia utile a stabilire un ""ambiente"" realistico, sia informazioni) perciò non aspettatevi azione nel senso classico, piuttosto aspettatevi di indagare...e riflettere, anche se sul secondo punto sono abbastanza confuso.
C'è poco da aggiungere al titolo, Orwell cita ovviamente l'autore di 1984 dove in una società distopica, le persone sono costantemente spiate per il bene di una nazione in cui non esiste alcuna opposizione.
Orwell è la piattaforma che andremo ad utilizzare, ""l'occhio"" del governo che attraverso indiscriminate ricerche e libere estrapolazioni di dati da social media, account bancari, cellulari, computer, dati medici e via dicendo sarà nostro compito assicurare alcuni ""terroristi"" (se lo siano o meno è vostro compito scoprirlo, e qui un altro problema che sorge) alla giustizia.
Qual'è il confine se esiste fra privacy e sicurezza? Ci abbiamo già rinunciato entrando nei social media e dando le nostre informazioni a qualsiasi sito le chieda? Paranoia o realtà? Se non abbiamo nulla da nascondere, cosa ci importa? 
Ma quali sono i criteri per esseri considerati ""un pericolo""? Magari si comincia con cose serie ma poi si arriva al conformismo totale sospettoso di qualsiasi differenza?
Queste solo alcune delle domande che il gioco pone, forse in maniera un pò ""guidata"" (alla fine la libertà di pensiero significa che il pensiero non deve essere influenzato) in certe parti, ma se all'inizio può sembrare avvincente indagare e collegare punti fra i vari indizi che prenderemo senza troppi scrupoli con qualche click da diversi metodi....alla fine rimarrà un pò di amarezza.
Perchè ...se capitasse veramente a voi? Mettiamo sia tutto complottismo e paranoia, ma se potesse accadere?
Non siamo poi così lontani, e le notizie del gioco rimandano a fatti reali ovviamente con nomi e tempi diversi.
Lo consiglio, non dura molto, si finisce in 7 ore, è completamente tradotto, ci sono delle piccole sbavature (soprattutto confusione fra gender o nomi di persone, o frasi tradotte troppo letteralmente dall'inglese)
Non credo comprerò il seguito, totalmente in inglese e che a quanto ho letto non è pari a questo.
Non mi ha ""sbalordito"" enormemente, ma fa pensare sia in termini di soluzione di alcuni ""enigmi"" che di temi etici.
Molto pratica la UI e piacevole l'utilizzo di ritratti disegnati in modo molto minimal.
Consigliato a chi ama i giochi di scelte e conseguenze che poi scopri che era tutto un equivoco.

Ensinam qual o fundamento, história, modo de se jogar, o que fazer e quando fazer para progredir no jogo.
Recomendo que jogadores PT-BR entrem na comunidade GTFO Brasil, lá terão mais pessoas para auxiliar e jogar junto, deixando a experiência com o game 200% melhor. | It's so good, though I have to warn anyone thinking about getting this game! If you are serious about buying it, then get at least two friends to buy it too because this game is made to test friendships and alone it isn't a real experience. I believe reviews that attack this game for being too hard are unreasonable, you are not meant to play it alone and neither finish a mission first try and you usually have to try 2-5 times until you develop the perfect strategy which then takes some time trying to execute it flawlessly. Due to this, the game is clearly not for everybody but for it's intended audience it's a really great experience! | Okay, I've given this enough chances, and I'll probably play more since some of my friends enjoy the game but I'm not recommending it.

What a damn shame, you make a game with a good engine, amazing atmosphere, great premise, rock hard objectives - then you mess up the bit which could have provided some of the most fun. The combat.

You've these wonderfully malformed enemies in the game, even invisible ones are cool, but the combat, fighting them is a exercise in frustration, and it's for a multitude of reasons.

- The weapons feel crap, they feel under powered and useless.

- The limitations on ammo are just a little too harsh, not even STARTING with full ammo is just a gash design decision.

- Headshots on enemies will remove the head, and characters even state, ""go for headshots"" but then the enemy can operate without a head... forever... like it's not a few hits before it dies, it's literally not dead.

- Those bloody things that shoot weird fast homing bullets have some of the most inconsistent hit registration on their missiles that I've ever seen, sometimes hitting you behind cover.

- The game will sometimes just toss crap at you after 40 minutes of doing a mission as if it wants to see you suffer.

Now, if all of the above is intention game design, well done, you've designed a game that isn't fun for me, sorry, I'm out - you've missed the mark, you had all the right ingredients, but it's come out wrong.

Almost there....

If this game was still just as hard, but had good, enjoyable combat, it would be an utter gem. As it stands, a very key core element for me is so frustrating, that I don't wish to play it. A great looking game, full of unique ideas, ruined by poor design all in the name of appearing hardcore. 

 | As someone who loves a difficult game, doesn't mind dying hundreds of times perfecting a strategy, and has a group of friends to play with who like the same type of game?

This game is actually garbage. I love the concept, but too many features push it from ""challenging"" to ""frustrating"". To add a little context for those who haven't played yet, the game is all about resource management. The general game loop is sneak/stealth kill enemies slowwwly working your way to rooms where you bunker down to defend while doing some objective or other. Even the slightest screw up means wasting ammo or health, which will result in a slow painful death to attrition over the multi-hour long stages. The checkpoints are a good hour apart, and don't truly ""save"" so if you have to stop playing, you lose hours of progress.

The final straw where me and my friends put it down was after an hour of brutal slog, we got to the stage finale for the first time. This involved running through an entirely new section of the facility with a swarm behind us, sleepers in front, and a timer. A completely new scenario to the rest of the level thus far. 

Of course, we died, we started contemplating a strategy to deal with it, but then realized the last checkpoint was over an hour back. We knew it would probably take us at least a few attempts to figure out a strat, which is bad enough, but on top of that eventually we'd run out of game time. Which means the next night we played we'd have to start from the beginning, get 1 or 2 attempts at the finale, rinse and repeat. Never touched the game again. | 이런 하드한 게임을 평가하기엔 너무 짧은 플탐이지만

Enemy armies a fraction of the size of yours will attack one after the other--when they have no chance of winning.

Why do attackers in sieges--or for that matter, *anyone* in field battles--start with a keep and build a town? It doesn't make sense. 

Clunky controls: can't back out of the steward without opening and closing the menu. No save option. Can't execute facing movements while defending a castle because it moves the camera.

[h1]Game overview[/h1]

In a nutshell, it's a business management game about turning slaves into gladiator champions, and you can play that angle pretty straight. It's not hard to achieve the basic goal of the game and win the championship with common sense choices, but the real meat of the game is taking what you've learned after beating it once and going for the ""true"" ending afterwards... then cranking up the difficulty after you're done that!

The important feature of the game, to either let the ai fight for you or take over a slave to fight as, gives this game appeal to different types of players. Fights are fun and varied, plenty of risk to take, and meaningful choices to make make this game a solid title. Hell, there's some ""off-optimal"" choices to make if you want to try goofy strategies.

[h1] Sound / Music [/h1]

Sounds do their job, but the game has a solid soundtrack. I find music to be important for games to set the mood, and the tracks do their job very well. Hell, I've added a couple of the songs to my own music collection! Well done.

[h1] Graphics [/h1]

Might be a turn off for those with ""pixel fatigue"", but they do their job, and are presentable. Most importantly, everything is clear and only becomes a problem in the big melees.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

Learning what to do off the bat is a bit of a challenge since the game doesn't hold your hand, but once you got the basics, managing the day to day is pretty straightfoward. Don't run out of resources, don't let your vets die, win as many fights as you can. You can look up a guide if you're having problems, but I recommend learning on your own, and don't be afraid of losing the game.

The management part of the game has enough meaningful choices to keep it interesting, though once you settle on on a strategy and know exactly what you want to achieve, it can be a bit of a drudgery. The events keep you from getting bored at least.

The battle themselves are simple and aren't paticullarly deep, but it can be fun to jump in as a fighter and go for it. Even better when you know combat tricks and go in as a stock standard slave with no gear and pull up a win anyways! 

[h1] Technical Issues and Asides [/h1]

Main ones I found are if you move a slave from one space to the next while paused in the management part of the game, you have to unpause before you can select it again. Kinda annoying if you're like me and like to sort your slaves by veterancy.

Another issue is slowdown during big fights, which can hitch the game and make multi-fighter fights a big death ball where everyone dies in 3 seconds. Careful with this one!

No other technical issues that were blatant. Pretty good game in this department overall.

Aside: there's an option to turn off the profanity in the crowd speech. I'm glad this was there, because I found the excessive profanity lines rather annoying to listen to.

The tone and humour in the game is spot on otherwise.

One more thing: there's cheese strats in the game for you to abuse, but that's ok because PRO GAMER MODE.

[h1] In Closing [/h1]

Game is very much worth the price point, even without the current Summer Sale. | Every single bug and feature complaint was fixed and patched since the release of this game.

The majority of Thumbs Downs currently are for bugs that are taken care of.

The game itself is immensely hard and has incredible replay value attached to it, coupled with interesting music and atmosphere that the game creates using events and urgency to make your gladiators the Best of the Best.

One of the easiest games to recommend to gamers due to enganging gameplay, magnificent dev support and high entertainment value. | 音乐真是倍儿棒啊！每次角斗士倒数计时的时候永远可以完美衔接，搭配场馆的欢呼和惊叹！可惜玩法有些单一，但是遇到next battle的音乐都能让人精神抖擞，

本人对英语略见一二，剧情大概是这样的：

  你是一个社会中层，手里刚刚拿下了过世老爹半衰不盛的家业————角斗士业，你要做的是准备好一年后的罗马帝国最终决战，只有大放异彩才能让你扬名天下，于是你着手开始操办自己的产业。

  没过几天，一位曾经服侍父亲的老教练来到你的场馆并且愿意为你提供训练角斗士的服务，你将他留下并且让他继续为你效力，同样还有帝国的将军和教会的人，将军可以提供有战斗技巧的士兵，而教会可以提供给你天赋异凛的零基础奴隶，当然这可能需要几枚金币。

  在无数的战斗中，你的角斗士有的扬名立万，有的尸骨无存，Macus为你赚得了无数金银财宝，有一天他告诉你，他厌倦了角斗士的生涯，打算解甲归田，你答应他在下一场1vs1的精英对决中
胜出就大赦他自由，几天后，他做到了，你如约给他自由，并且给了几枚金币作为盘缠，他带着感激收下了。

  将军和教会虽然都属于罗马帝国，但是他们互相之间也有斗争，你作为中间人，不仅可以用美酒谄媚，还可以在事件中进行抉择。（随机事件：出现一个红发外邦女奴，这两个人都想要；出现事情需要人手，你需要派出你的奴隶去干活 等等），好感越好，他们举办的决斗你就可以收获更多。
  
  最后你在最终决斗中扬名天下，但是你的竞争对手心有不甘，派人暗杀了将军和教主，并栽赃了你，在帝国面前，卑微的你临终前甚至都要被拿来让观众取乐。你被扔至角斗场内，在残忍的角斗士面前，你一个弱女子，和一把匕首，你知道它的效果在面前的角斗士身上的护甲聊胜于无，当你认为一切都要结束时，你听到斗技场门口的异响，带头的是Macus，身边站着所有对你有感恩之心的角斗士们。 | I bought this game, returned to it later on to see some content i had access to was removed and is now being sold as DLC.

The Driller can tunnel through walls, which is especially useful during evacuations. The Gunner has impressive firepower and can significantly support the team. The Engineer can deploy turrets that shoot at enemies and aid in navigation. The Scout is very fast and excels at scouting the terrain.

游戏中的语音交流缺失。大多数对局玩家间的交流偏少，语言交流甚至无交流是主流现象。对这部分有需求的玩家需要考虑一下。

AI is broken, gets lost easily/walks into walls. Controls feel janky. Matches take HOURS, and most of the time is spent wrestling with the controls. It's really not great. Tell me if I'm missing something. | Is it great? No.
Is it good? Yeah
Does it look good? Yepp
Does it sound good? Always.

This is another Games Workshop license game that could've been amazing but end up being good. There is a 15 part story mode and an Operations mode that you can repeatr. Operations mode is where you have the most fun though as you get to create your own team and progress it through an operation, a series of battles and choices to improve them and gear up. 

The AI of the enemies could've used some more time in the over though as they sometimes make sound decisions that completely screw you over, but other times get stuck on terrain or mistake verticality and end up using a reaction skill instead of actually participating.

Did I have fun? Sure did, but after playing though the story twice and the operations on different difficulties with each of the 5 hourses I've done all there is (aside from steam achievements). 
However, I feel like games such as X COM did a better job at making a campaign out of it and systems surrounding it. This one is keeping close to the board game which both assists and hinders it. | I actually like this game a LOT, it's like Morheim but in 40k Necromunda setting and with better mechanics, if you liked Mordheim and you like 40k, you will enjoy this game, I Love 40k but did not particularly liked Necromunda but still enjoying this game a lot, I have already more than 100 hours in a game that I paid 2.5 USD in sale with gang DLC included, I understand the complains, and yes!, the game had so much potential, the graphics are fine, the dynamic music is nice, game-play loop and mechanics are good and the ambiance is perfect, the only problem is AI sucks, not to the point that will prevent you from enjoying this game if you don't have huge expectations but definitely needed improvements, prioritizing attack instead of buffing and doing objectives will be enough, sadly the game is abandoned, so you rather play in higher difficulties, and don't get me wrong, AI is capable of taking down your gang member if you don't pay attention, but better AI would make this game way better for sure. Still recommend only if you liked Mordheim or like tactical turn based RPG and  W40k, it's an easy pick in sale and get gang DLC at least to get more enemy variety, even if you don't plan to play them. | It's a real shame. I loved the tabletop game, but this game just does not work for me. | My upvote on this title is somewhat conditional, so take the time to hear me out before leaping to buy this title on sale. The way I purchased it was on deep sale in such a way with the gang DLC expansions I forked out less than $10. At that price it's passable, provided you are a superfan of Mordheim (I have that on on GOG) and just want a 40k version of the same thing.

Gorgeous visuals, complicated maps that make strategic planning an absolute requirement to anything resembling victory, and the unique environment of the Underhive all serve as definite selling points. The downside is a handful of apparently unresolved bugs (key mapping anything outside the defaults seems to barricade access to key abilities, be forewarned and learn to cope with the decidely wonky setup). 

The AI is hit and miss, arguably more often falling on miss than anything else. There are times AI players wander in patterns leaving one to wonder if they're dopesick, suffering severe brain injuries, or just plain thicker than kiln fired shit bricks. The single player campaign is a tedious tutorial that leaves you marginally better prepared for the real meat, where you design your own gang from the families in play, with customization options the likes of which I would have loved in Mordheim.

The downside is a total lack of MP support at this late date, flimsy optimization that will likely leave you struggling to get a balance of smooth operation and graphic fidelity worthy of the artwork that was so lovingly crafted down to the last arm strap and facial implant.

If you love turn based squad tactics like Mordheim offered, don't mind battling enemy gangs seemingly intoxicated to near comatose levels of reasoning, and an interface that was apparently locked in on a hard coded level that means all customization sabotages basic function, you can squeeze some good times from this game to get your handful of bucks out of it in entertainment value.

It works like it was developed in the Underhive itself. Take that as you will, I still enjoy the periodic return to the grime and gruesomeness of Necromunda's lowest social tiers. I'm perhaps easier to please than most, so take that as either a warning or endorsement as you will.

Lots of bonking about the heads of your foes with makeshift clubs crafted from enormous industrial fasteners though...hard to complain about that."

With the number of hours I'd played I even spent over 100$ supporting the game by buying skins and what not. I enjoyed the flow, the challenge, and the strategy. I know every card. How they're played. How they're countered. 

So why am I giving it a negative review now?  I recently came back to it to find out the game had completely changed. 

Why oh why have the devs decided to remove wild cards (doubles of the same card in the same deck) and duplicate cards (the same card in your teammates deck) in premade team battles?? Half the fun of this game was being able to strategize with a friend and come up with crazy combos, thematic decks, and sometimes just plain goofy ridiculous decks early in the league. I strongly believe the percent chance of drawing a deck defining card or executing your intended combo is a key element of dueling cards in general. Think Magic or Yu Gi Oh.

Overview: Minion Masters is a fast-paced, free-to-play strategy game that blends elements of tower defense and collectible card games (CCG). Developed by BetaDwarf, the game pits players in 1v1 or 2v2 battles where they summon and control minions to battle against their opponent’s forces, all while managing a deck of cards. With its unique mix of gameplay styles, Minion Masters offers an accessible but strategic experience for fans of both strategy games and card battling.

Gameplay: In Minion Masters, players build and use decks of cards to summon minions, cast spells, and build structures on the battlefield. Each card corresponds to a different type of unit, spell, or structure that players can deploy in real-time. The key to success is not just about deploying powerful units but also about managing your resources (mana), timing your plays, and reacting to your opponent’s strategy.

The game offers several different modes, including standard 1v1 and 2v2, where players can compete against other players or AI. The matches are quick, lasting around 5-10 minutes, which makes it easy to jump into a game and not get bogged down by long sessions. The action is fast-paced, with constant back-and-forth gameplay, making it exciting for those who enjoy real-time strategy with a bit of card game strategy mixed in.

Deck Building and Strategy: The strategic depth of Minion Masters comes from deck building. Players can collect new cards and customize their deck to suit their playstyle, with different minions, spells, and special abilities available to choose from. The key to winning is finding the right balance between offense and defense, while also considering synergy between the cards in your deck. There are a variety of minion types, each with strengths and weaknesses, which adds an extra layer of tactical decision-making to each match.

Progression and Monetization: As with many free-to-play games, Minion Masters includes a progression system where players can unlock new cards and cosmetics by earning rewards from matches or purchasing card packs. While the game is generally balanced and not pay-to-win, there is an option for players to spend money on card packs and other cosmetic items. This could give some players a slight advantage early on, but most progress can still be made through regular gameplay.

Graphics and Performance: Minion Masters features bright, colorful visuals with a somewhat cartoonish art style that fits the fast-paced, playful nature of the game. The minions and spells are well-designed, with each card having its own unique look and animations that help bring the battlefield to life. The game runs smoothly on most systems, and the controls are intuitive, making it accessible for both new players and strategy veterans alike.

Audio Design: The sound design in Minion Masters is solid, with an upbeat soundtrack and engaging sound effects that add to the excitement of the battles. Each card and minion has its own set of sounds, from the footsteps of marching troops to the explosive effects of spells, helping to immerse players in the game’s action. The voice lines of the minions and the announcer are charming and add some personality to the game.

Challenges: While Minion Masters is accessible, there is a learning curve when it comes to building effective decks and mastering the timing and positioning of your units. As players unlock more cards, they can start building more diverse strategies, but the game’s fast pace means you need to react quickly, which can be challenging for newcomers. The game also features matchmaking, but occasionally, you may find yourself up against opponents who have stronger cards if you're not progressing quickly enough.

Final Thoughts: Minion Masters is a fun and fast-paced strategy game that offers a unique blend of collectible card gameplay with real-time strategy. Its quick matches, deck-building mechanics, and strategic depth make it an enjoyable experience for players who enjoy both card games and strategy games. While there’s a progression system that could feel grindy at times, the game remains accessible, and its focus on skill and strategy makes it rewarding for those who stick with it.

Pros:

Fast-paced and accessible gameplay
Strong strategic depth through deck-building and unit placement
Bright, colorful visuals with appealing animations
Free-to-play with fair monetization options
Multiple game modes including 1v1 and 2v2
Cons:

Progression can feel slow at times
Pay-to-progress elements, though not pay-to-win
Some balancing issues, especially at early levels
Can become repetitive if not switching up strategies
Minion Masters is an enjoyable strategy game for those who like quick battles, tactical decision-making, and card collection. While there are some minor progression hurdles, the game offers a solid and fun experience for fans of competitive, strategic gameplay. | This game was fun for a while. I found it late thinking it was a new game. After several months of loving it and playing it almost daily; the fun is now at its end. Nothing new is coming to it. | ""Если бы мне сказали, что я буду проводить ночи напролет, крича на экран из-за толпы миньонов, я бы не поверил. Но вот я здесь, с кругами под глазами и улыбкой до ушей. Minion Masters — это как смесь покера, шахмат и цирка, где все участники слегка не в себе.

Что мне нравится:

Миньоны-психопаты. Серьезно, кто еще будет бросать летающих свиней в драконов? Это гениально!

Стратегия? Шутка? И то, и другое! Ты думаешь, что всё продумал, но тут твой противник выкидывает карту, которая превращает твою армию в лягушек. Лягушек, Карл!

Быстрые матчи. Это как фастфуд, только без угрызений совести. 5 минут — и ты либо герой, либо лузер. Но в любом случае хочется еще.

Что не нравится:

Случайные карты. Иногда тебе выпадает такая рука, что хочется плакать. Но это часть веселья, правда?

Итог: Minion Masters — это идеальная игра для тех, кто хочет немного адреналина, много смеха и возможность почувствовать себя злым гением (или просто неудачником с хорошим чувством юмора). Если вы еще не играли, то что вы вообще делаете со своей жизнью?

76561197974286855,572300,Nyheim,7.016666666666667,Strategy,1,"Nyheim takes the setup of Rebuild and tweaks it more resemble a dice driven solitaire boardgame. Instead of zombies, it's killer mutated diseased rats. Move around searching, getting new characters and items, averting random event crises, and trying to fulfill quests. You can win by upgrading your HQ to max level, completing the string of primary quests, or simply surviving for one full year.

A lot of negtive reviews say the RNG is too hard. You can dismiss that as people who don't know what they're talking about, BUT I've played plenty of of ""player(s) vs. the system"" board games (Pandemic, Arkham Horror, Eldritch Horror, Elder Signs, Ghost Stories, Mansions of Madness, Yggdrasil, and others), so I'd like to think I can comment on the mechanics. I was looking forward to Nyheim because it looked like they were trying to emulate this experience.

Nyheim screws it up. Badly.

The dice system is like Elder Signs. Each die is 8 sided and there are 4 different symbols: hearts, eyes, lightning bolts, and lightbulbs. Thing is, not all dice are equal. Each party member gets to roll a die each turn and each character will have different symbol distributions on their die. Some might have an even spread. Some might have 4 bolts and a heart but nothing else. Every time you try to search, fight off rats, or solve challenges, they will each have certain symbols that need to be rolled to beat them. 

The problem is you WILL get screwed when a challenge comes up requiring symbols you just don't have. Need 2 hearts? Too bad, there's only one die with hearts on it. 2 bolts? There are only 2 dice with one bolt each so it's a 1/64 chance each turn, and if you miss it then you get an injury which will eat a bolt roll every turn and the only way to get rid of it is to spend a turn resting but you to roll a bolt during resting and that's after it eats a bolt so again that's only a 1/64 chance of getting the double bolts you need to heal it and you have to do that 3 times to get rid of the injury. Then it's back to hoping for that 1/64 chance again and another injury every time you mess up. It's supposed to be a ""strategy"" to get characters or items with the right symbols, but you have no control over the options you'll get and will often be locked out of symbols no matter what.

These kind of games need a resource to fudge rolls. Usually it's to buy rerolls or guarantee a certain result. Nyheim does use the food resource for rerolls but that doesn't make any difference if you don't have the symbols in the first place. Some items can convert certain rolls to others, but it probably won't be the ones you need, you can't control which items you get, and each character can only carry one item. Other games solve this by making all dice the same so you always have a chance of rolling what you need, or wildcard symbols. Elder Sign lets you burn resources for rerolls, guaranteeing facing, or adding dice with better symbols on them. Nyheim tries to be these games but doesn't understand the balancing mechanic.

What these games also do is make defeat a matter of accumulated bad luck or bad decisions. Nyheim screws you with a single random result far too early and often. You have to establish a headquarters early on, and many important quests and crises happen at the HQ. Each search has a chance of spawning killer rats that will attack you every turn you're there. Spawn killer rats at the HQ the 2nd turn? ""You're fucked; might as well start over"" should be the game's slogan.

But you can't just start over. You have to play each defeat out to the very end if you want experience points, which are used to buy modifiers in future games. You can buy a perk with strengths and drawbacks for 50xp (more survivors spawn, but more rats show up, etc.) or 250xp for the perk without the drawback. You get maybe 50-150xp each run and the perks only last one game. Grind 5 runs to save up for a bunch of perks you buy for one game for your serious attempt at winning? Well the random number generator just fucked you that game so you die and all your perks are wasted. Have fun grinding more for another shot.

Nuts to that. This game BADLY needs to impliment some kind of system that allows wildcard rolls. Powerful rat swarms should not spawn early game (especially on your HQ) (and seriously, it gets to the point where searching isn't ever worth it unless it's for a quest). Injuries shouldn't be so severe (at least make the symbols they discard different from the ones required to heal them). Changes need to happen before this stops being anything but a futile RNG grindfest. I regularly play solitaire boardgames where 70% loss rates are the norm, and even I'm calling the RNG difficulty here B.S. And I really hope they do improve it, because the premise, basic setup, and polish are all good. If it was actually balanced to not be total B.S. anymore then this would be a great fun little game. | Fun game!  Definitely took the entire tutorial to get things firmly figured out.  And there is a learning curve, for sure.  My first few games were riddled with big mistakes, which immediately cost me the game.  But, it was fun enough that I wanted to keep at it.  Got really far during my third attempt... but one bad decision ended up snowballing in to another failure.

So, there's definitely a challenge, VERY worthy of the $4 price tag... and the game has so many ways that it can eventually expand, that it might be the most inexpensive game that I'll keep coming back to again and again.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

UPDATE (after having played two more games):
My opinion has not only remained VERY POSITIVE, but I think I like the game even more now.

For the reviews that say ""luck kills you every time!""... No, it doesn't.  The last two times I played, I won both games.  Yes, luck plays a major part in the game... but there are definite ways to enhance how your luck goes.  

--Make sure you have a fairly even amount of resources on the dice, because you they ALL seem equally important.. so being without one is really bad.

--Go on adventures, but always keep rolling back to your home base.  Build up your food supplies and upgrade the hell out of your home base.  Make it so that every time you visit home, you have a steady supply of Food and Survivors to get yourself back to 100%.

--Figure out a hierarchy of your crew.  Someone might have to die.  And instead of spreading your injuries around, kill off the least valuable member of your crew and then immediately go home (if  you have an upgrade that brings people in) and replace him/her.

--When you do get new Survivors, be smart.  Don't attach yourself to anyone.  Pick the team with the best balance and the least amount of Food dice.  Blanks suck, but blanks don't hurt you like Food hurts you.

--And lastly, when all seems lost, it can be easy to lose hope and abandon the game.  But you can still survive.  Food can eventually be replenished.  More Survivors will come immediately.  And, I've found, the more you suffer, the greater it feels when something does fall in your favor.  It actually feels like you're trying to survive.  Low lows but very high highs. | 很久以前在手机上玩过，后来在这看见就买了的。
听闻开发者要解散，也算是留个纪念吧。 | Этой игре сильно не хватает настройки сложности.

Нет, ну она-то выглядит неплохо. Изначально. Кидаешь кости, выполняешь челленджи, все счастливы.

Через пять минут ты понимаешь, что с хорошим шансом при поиске припасов ты можешь наткнуться на монстра (ах вот что означало эта ""Высокая угроза"" на половине локаций!) Ещё через минуту - что убить самого простого монстра ты можешь с шансом примерно 50%. А неубитый монстр - это рана, которая отнимает такие жизненно важные значения костей, уменьшая шансы. Через десять минут включается первая Угроза (отнимая значения безусловно и везде), а ещё через пять разражается первый кризис. (А пять пропущенных кризисов - конец игры). Ещё через минуту ты открываешь, что две раны у одного персонажа - это его безусловная смерть.

Я пробовал четыре раза, используя разные тактики и тщательно подбирая кости. Без вариантов. Либо игра специально меня гробит, либо не с моим везением в неё играть. Не рекомендую никому, кроме отъявленных мазохистов/любителей челленджа. | Looked really interesting, gave it a shot.

After an hour of the RNG throwing horrible things at me constantly, I had to quit because my stress levels had simply gotten way too high.

I don't know if I was just unlucky, or I didn't know what I was doing (possibly both?), but the game -really- feels incredibly stacked against the player, to the point that it feels absolutely impossible to make any positive headway.

It's a losing battle from the beginning, and just keeps getting worse.

The concept is interesting, but I found the actual experience of it so utterly painful that I doubt I'll play this game again unless I feel particularly masochistic.

I barely paid a dollar for it (on sale), and I'm almost tempted to get a refund. I won't, since it's only a dollar, and I'm lazy, and on the off chance that I ever decide to give it a shot.

I really want to like the game... there's certainly some interesting elements here, and I like the whole board game/cards/rebuild the city thing, but man... it's just too relentless.

You go around the map, searching through locations for useful things (items, characters to join you, food) and doing quests, all the while dealing with the infected rat threat. You deal with these things by rolling dice, each character having a dice pool.

Dice aren't numbered, but have icons representing certain skills/abilities like awareness, endurance, etc.

To ""clear"" an event (whether you're searching, or fighting rats, or whatever), it ""costs"" a certain amount of skills/abilities (which you must roll with your dice). For example, defeating some rats might require you to roll one die of agility and one of endurance; if you succeed, you defeat the rat, if you fail (don't roll what you need), the rat hurts you.

When you get hurt, you receive a wound of some kind, which usually makes you lose dice rolls of a certain type.

There are also random events (I had nuclear fog, a thunderstorm, and a heatwave) which can all negatively impact your dice rolls as well (basically ""stealing/eating up"" certain rolls).

The problem is that there are so many bad things constantly happening that it's basically impossible to get anywhere, as things beyond your control will constantly ""eat up"" your rolls, making it hard to impossible to progress.

If you enjoy board games and are a glutton for punishment, maybe give this game a try.

Otherwise, stay away."

缺点是流程通关后，对比纯DBG来说欺诈之地的游戏过程，操作都显得繁琐，因此重玩性并不是很高。
考虑到游戏整体内容的丰富度，对于50块不到的定价来说确实性价比不错，比较适合轻度卡牌玩家游玩，对中毒卡牌玩家特别是杀戮尖塔佬来说可能会有点无聊了。[b]特别是不喜欢看字只喜欢打牌的，别买，买了又退款你也嫌麻烦，要么给差评游戏也冤枉啊。[/b] | 卡组的构建和两个战斗系统的搭配无疑是失败的，或者说，游戏的这两个核心之处带给我的体验是糟糕的。从世界观、人物塑造和美术等方面来说，这是个很好的胚子，可惜为了强行贴合制作组并不擅长卡组构建，这个胚子被糟蹋了，让人叹息。 | Griftlands is a standout gem in the world of strategy and roguelike games. The writing in the campaign is nothing short of brilliant, with dialogue that brings the characters and world to life. Each interaction feels authentic and contributes to the rich tapestry of the story.

One of the game's most intriguing mechanics is the card system, which involves building two separate decks: one for negotiation and one for combat. This dual-deck system adds a layer of strategic depth, allowing players to navigate the game's challenges in multiple ways. The negotiation deck, in particular, shines as it enables players to resolve conflicts and persuade others with cunning and wit.

However, while the card mechanics are innovative, the viability of combat leaves something to be desired. Choosing to engage in battles often comes with significant consequences, which can sometimes make combat feel like a less appealing option compared to negotiation. This aspect could benefit from some balancing to make combat a more rewarding and viable choice.

Despite this, Griftlands is a captivating experience that masterfully blends storytelling and strategy. Its unique mechanics and compelling narrative make it a must-play for fans of the genre. | 叙事故事和玩法结合的极好，一个剧本适合反复刷"

Moonlighter es un juego donde controlamos a un comerciante llamado Will el cual dirige una tienda llamada Moonlighter que vende toda clase de productos extraídos de unas extrañas mazmorras que se generan aleatoriamente cada vez que se entra en ellas.

No es el mejor rougelike de acción ni es el mejor juego de comercio, pero mezcla muy bien estos dos conceptos y lo vuelven un juego muy único y divertido.

Además, visualmente es hermoso y tiene muy buena banda sonora.



Más allá de esta premisa, no me gustaría contar mucho más acerca de la historia ya que es mejor descubrirlo por uno mismo.

Pese a que narrativamente suena bastante raro el concepto de que las mazmorras se generen aleatoriamente (osea a nivel jugable es entendible por el genero al que pertenece, pero a nivel de trama pues no tiene mucho sentido), poco a poco se va descubriendo el porque de este extraño suceso.

Es un juego que todo el mundo comienza a jugar por ver que ofrecen las mecánicas, pero todo el mundo lo termina por revelar el misterio de las extrañas mazmorras. Y merece la pena.


Pero lo importante: el juego.

La parte de rougelike de acción es bastante típica dentro de este genero: se generan los niveles de forma aleatoria pero manteniendo patrones que hacen que poco a poco los jugadores se adapten al entorno luchando contra varios tipos de enemigos y recoger las diferentes recompensas que otorgan.

Aquí lo importante será avanzar poco a poco y decidir cuando merece la pena continuar para seguir consiguiendo objetos y cuando es mejor volver a la tienda para asegurar todos los objetos conseguidos durante la run y no arriesgarse a morir y perder el progreso.

Piensa que este es un roguelike progresivo. 
Es decir, que lo importante es asegurar unos objetos para conseguir dinero con el que mejorar tu equipo y así poder derrotar a tus enemigos más fácilmente para llegar cada vez más lejos en la mazmorra hasta poder luchar y finalmente derrotar al jefe final.



¡Pero esto solo es la primera parte del juego! Ahora viene la segunda: el comercio.

Una vez vuelvas a la tienda tienes que vender los objetos para conseguir dinero con el que mejorar tu equipo (y también mejorar la tienda y el pueblo).

Lo que lo hace tan especial es lo siguiente: Tu no sabes el valor de los objetos que obtienes, lo tienes que descubrir mediante la reacción de los clientes:

¿Tu objeto es demasiado caro? El cliente reaccionará enfadado y no comprará el objeto.

¿Tu objeto es demasiado barato? El cliente reaccionará contento y comprará el objeto. De hecho, a veces la reacción será tan positiva que merecerá la pena subir el precio en la próxima venta.

Y en esto consiste el comercio: en buscar el equilibrio para que los clientes estén contentos y siempre quieran comprar, al mismo tiempo que tu siempre obtienes el máximo beneficio posible.



Si os fijáis, tanto el rougelike como el comercio tienen una cosa en común: Tomar decisiones.

No es un juego muy difícil, ni tampoco requiere mucha habilidad, pero si requiere pensar mucho en cada paso que vas a tomar para la siguiente vez que vayas a las mazmorras, puedas avanzar lo máximo posible hasta poder enfrentarte al jefe final de cada mazmorra y poder derrotarlo.









En resumen:

Un rougelike de acción y comercio que mezcla muy bien estos dos conceptos y lo vuelve una experiencia única y muy entretenida.


Moonlighter es uno de estos juegos que no hace nada revolucionario que destaca por encima de otros videojuegos del mismo genero, pero todo lo hace bien y de forma justa y balanceada. Tanto el combate, exploración, gestión comercial y progresión es excelente y dura lo justo para que nunca se sienta aburrido ni repetitivo en ningún momento.

Además, entra muy bien por los ojos por esos hermosos gráficos pixel art, tanto en sus escenarios, como sus animaciones llenas de detalle en el protagonista y los diferentes NPC de la aldea.

¿Y que decir de la banda sonora? Delicia para mis oídos. Además me encanta la música dinámica cuando hablas con los diferentes comerciantes del pueblo y estos tienen su propio tema adaptado a su temática.


Nada más que decir señoría: Juego totalmente recomendado. Imprescindible si te gustan los rougelike y los juegos de comercio.

 | As a long time Football manager player, I write this review with a heavy heart. Not enough has changed since last year. I want revolutional changes, I want SI to push the boundries. They are not.

At this point, it feels like a EA game, churning out year after year just for the sake of it ££££. If you are new to FM then yes, this is the game you should pick, but then you could always take last years game.

SI if you do bother reading this (which I suspect you don't), please do better next year.

 | 这游戏我玩了573个小时，不算短了。

我从2010开始入的FM的坑，代代都玩，不算长，但也不算短了。

这个系列越来越难玩了，或者说让我越玩越没有激情了。

也许是玩的时间越长，发现的Bug越多。有的Bug一出现，让人意兴阑珊，真的。

列举几个我最讨厌的Bug：

1. 全场30多脚射门，5、6脚在门框范围内。
    我一开始觉得是球员能力低，后来我练小牛，最后一群CA在160以上的球员，射门命中率仍然极低。

2. 投资
    当我的俱乐部的资产接近1B的时候，董事会会给我发邮件，说要进行投资。然后，大约300M的钱就从账面上消失了。我特别不爽，难道俱乐部投资出去的钱，就不算俱乐部的资产了么？董事会知道我为攒着些钱付出多少辛苦么？

3. 中文翻译
    不多吐槽，大家都清楚我的意思

4. 金球奖、足球先生、年度最佳阵容
    三冠王的球队里，没有人进入金球奖和足球先生的前三甲，没有人入选年度最佳阵容。这是在开玩笑么？

5. 续约涨工资
    我能理解球员想挣更多的钱，但是明天是欧冠决赛，你要上场踢球，你今天跟我提续约涨工资的事情，合适么？

我相对游戏开发商说，我不求下一代画面有多精美，只是希望这个游戏能真实一点。

毕竟，真实，才是FM最大的优势，才是FM最重要的卖点。


 | Another year another dissappointment

I grew up playing Championship manager and bought every copy of Football manager from 2005 to 2016. The series have been getting worse since around 2012 and because 2016 was such an utter pile of garbage, 2017 was the first vintage I skipped. Now I decided to give 2018 a new opportunity to lure me in but after playing it for around 50 hours I can already say I’m going to skip next years FM as well.

Remember when FM used to be fun?  When starting the game and “Just playing a couple of games” turned an all nighter and you realize the sun is up and you haven’t eaten since last afternoon or slept at all. Those were the times- I believe it was around FM 2012 since things started going downhill. Every year SI started to add meaningless crap in order to broke the core game that was so enjoyable. The only change I’ve enjoyed since then is the new tactics system (player roles), everything else has made the game worse. What bugs me the most in this years edition:

Team talk is still (and even more than before) broken:
Want your team to perform as expected?  Always be aggressive in your team talks. Don’t tell them calmly you expect them to win, don’t be assertive or passionate no, YOU MUST SHOUT AT THEM!!!! In half time the biggest mistake you can make is to tell your team you are happy at their performance, keep it up. I just watched my team conceding 6 goals within the first 30 minutes of second half against a weaker opponent (from 3-0 to 3-6) after that team talk before I rage quitted. Always warn them against complacency and if they are down… again SHOUT AT THEM!!!   Because apparently according to SI that is leadership and this is how you lead professional footballers.    

Shouts:
Do these even do anything?  There seems to be very little to no response from the players. Pointless and confusing.	

More media interviews
This has always been a tedious part of the game. Choose an answer from 5 options maybe your players or opponent react maybe not. Let’s add even more meaningless tunnel interviews, everybody enjoys those just before the match. Pointless and not fun.

Interaction with the players outside the pitch
This part of the game seems to get more foothold year after year and is as tedious as the media interviews and almost as broken as the team talks. Whether it is not getting enough playing time, not being allowed to leave for a ridiculously low transfer fee, not being named the captain, being played out of position, team not performing good enough, treating teammate unfairly or whatever other bullcrap reason they will act like primadonnas and you have to resolve the issue.  Atleast there is an option where you can tell them to stop acting like a twat and get to work, some take it better than others. Tedious and most of the time just annoying.    

The thing is the parts that make the game enjoyable are still there but every year it gets harder to enjoy them as the focus of the game goes into wrong direction. Scouting and finding unknown young players, nurturing the talent and watch them become club icons. Selling them for big money and using that to improve the facilities and to bring in even better players. Starting with a team in some obscure nation and watching the whole nation develop as you gain success for your team. That’s what I fell in love with playing the old FM’s and unfortunately in the newer editions all that is buried under new additions that are not fun nor interesting nor useful. 

As stated before,  I won’t be buying the 2019 edition after this. Hopefully SI will come to senses and bring back and improve what I used to love 6-10 years ago. Otherwise it might be time to admit that FM and I have grown apart and part our ways for good. | 16 17 18를 구매한 유저의 입장으로써는 제작사의 행보에 실망을 감출수가 없다.

매해 새로운 시리즈를 내놓지만 인터페이스 장난질만 하고있다. 게다가 그래픽은 아직도 2000년대 초반 그래픽을 유지하고 있으며 여전히 매치엔진은 혁신적인 발전을 이루어 내지 못하고 있다. 경쟁작이 없다보니 제작사의 배때지가 따뜻해서 정신을 못차리는것 같다. 가능성은 희박하지만 풋볼매니저와 경쟁을 겨룰만한, 정말 기본만 탄탄하게 다진 경쟁작이 출시가 된다면 풋볼매니저는 몰락할 가능성이 높다고 생각한다.

I always buy FM touch as it is pritty much what FM or CM was when is was in its prime. Not too complex but complex enough. I find the full game to have too much micro management and to be frustrating.

My biggest complaint is where has text commentary gone? The text commentary with the flashing GOAL! indicator has been part of CM and FM since day one and after nearly 30 years they take it out of the game without any explanation. Not only that it's been replaced with nothing that tells you whats going on in the moment. So bascally you are forced to play 2D or 3D and if you don't want to watch the entire game in either of these modes and want highlgihts then instead of text commentary you are given a stats screen.

S.I want you to use their crappy 3D engine and watch each game from start to finish and if you don't like it though!

I always play in 2D classic with highlights and text commentary, this way a season doesn't take a year to complete. You cant do this anymore. Gone.....

I don't like the overhauled scouting system, seems inferior to last years which didn't need changing in all honesty and the match day scream has been messed up all together.

All in all the U.I is very badly designed, nothing flows or seems to be implemented with any logical thinking.

Also where did the crappy theme tune come from? FM and gay bar music don't mix.

Like alot of game franchsies today the developer seems to love changing things that didn't need fixing.

FM was perfect ten years ago, why it had to be messed around with is beyond me. This is coming from someone who has played every CM and FM since 97/98.

Very disappointed with the changes and have requested a refund.

Yet another classic game messed up when it was fine to start with. 

If only I could play FM 2005-08 with a up to date data base.

3/10 | Пожалуйста, измените в Российском чемпионате, что можно не в заявке на игру, а в стартовом составе 6 иностранцев!!! Очень сильно влияет на игру!


There is a huge mistake in Russian championship! Actually, start eleven must have no more, than 6 foreign players. But in the game match squad must have no more than 6 foreign players. Please, change it!!! I think everyone who's team is from Russian championship will agree with me, that it is impossible to play now! | FM Touch 2018; ayrıntılara boğmadan, hızlı ve akıcı bir oynanış sunarak zamanı olmayan siz çalışan menejerlerin imdadına yetişiyor.

There is one change that pretty much makes this game a worthwhile buy for me:

Factions all have really strong flavor and personality, so it's nice to just catch a vibe with. Definitely recommended if you're into Stellaris but don't always have the mental bandwidth to create your own roleplay as you go. Turn-based as well, adding to the chill factor. All-around solid game. | One of my favorite games ever. 

Pros:
+ Visuals are eye candy. Smooth and pleasing.
+ Music is ear candy. One of the absolute best soundtracks I have heard from a game.
+ The game-play is very fun, a little overwhelming at first but then it all falls into place.
+ It's turn-base and while not really a plus, I know some folks enjoy calculating their every move unlike RTS.
+ Unlike Stellaris, (another goat) this game has some pretty good lore.

- I HATE HACKING, I DON'T CARE FOR IT, TAKE IT AWAY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD | [h2] Endless Space 2 - Наследница первой пробы пера [/h2]
[i] Я начинал свой путь еще с Endless Space 1 и Endless Space 2 является достойным продолжением вселенной Endless. Участвовал в бета тесте игры и активностях на форуме разработчиков (Таких как выбор внешности некоторых фракций - Несгибаемые и Хор Теней). У игры был долгий путь разработки и она стала результатом трудов, в том числе, многих фанатов вселенной Endless. Что получилось в итоге? [/i]
[h2] За что стоит ее любить эту игру [/h2] 
[list]
    [*][i] Фракции - каждая фракция уникальна, любой игрок сможет выбрать фракцию на свой вкус. Некоторые перекочевали из первой части, но еще больше новых. Основных фракций восемь (без дополнений). Каждая фракция имеет свой сюжет и приличное количество заданий, что помогут познакомиться с ними поближе. 
Например, хочешь быть безумным ученым? Софоны будут тебе по душе, а внешне они напоминают причудливых зеленых человечков. 
Думаешь, что путь к победе, это развитие промышленности и влияние? Единая империя (Местное человечество) идет по этому пути, но даже этот путь ты сможешь изменить. Остаться на пути промышленности, стать ученым или наращивать военную мощь? Ты сможешь принимать судьбоносные решения. [/i]
    [*][i] Геймплей - По сравнению с Endless Space 1 и Endless Legend, расширили и сделали глубже все элементы 4х-стратегий. 
Прохождение основного сюжета поведает вам Академии, космической гильдии героев и ее лидере. Наличие множества побочных заданий, наткнуться на которые ты сможешь просто исследуя мир. Без преувеличения, интересное исследование бескрайнего космоса, где даже исследование странного сигнала на планете, может привести к неожиданному результату. 
Изучение различных веток технологий, от возможности колонизации неприветливых миров до постройки огромных военных крейсеров. Колонизация новых миров и их развитие, в том числе уникальных планет, что были оставлены древней, более развитой расой. Огромное количество торговых и дипломатических возможностей, от покупки ценных ресурсов до заключения альянса между империями. И самые проработанные и захватывающие космические сражения, лучшие в своем жанре. [/i]
    [*][i] Графика - Начиная с главного меню и заканчивая роликом победы одной из фракций, все что вы уведите, будет выглядеть волшебно и завораживающе. Эта игра подарит вам ощущение бескрайнего и неизведанного, местами причудливого космоса (Как на счет фракции высокоразвитых деревьев или роботов, что больше напоминают насекомых поглощающих все на своем пути?). Каждый арт, каждый ролик или эффект от взрыва планеты выполнен на недосягаемо качественном уровне. На мой личный взгляд, в этой игре космос выполнен лучше всего и крупные франшизы, такие как Mass Effect или Star Wars не передают даже крупицы этой красоты. [/i]
    [*][i] Музыка Endless Space 2 - это шедевр, который погружает вас в атмосферу космоса и подчеркивает эпичность происходящего. Композитор Arnaud Roy создал великолепный саундтрек, который идеально сочетается с визуальным стилем игры и подчёркивает уникальность каждой фракции. Музыка разнообразна и эмоциональна. Здесь вы услышите эпические и величественные мелодии, которые сопровождают ваши великие открытия и завоевания, а также более спокойные и лирические треки, которые звучат во время мирного развития империи. [/i]
[/list]
[h2] К сожалению есть и ложка дёгтя в этой бочке мёда [/h2]
[list]
    [*][i] Порог вхождения и интерфейс - как в любой 4х-стратегии это вызов для игрока. Разобраться в механиках игры может быть сложно. В игре есть обучение, но к сожалению оно не столь подробное и даже после его прохождения могут остаться вопросы. Интерфейс игры - это лабиринт из различных вкладок и информации (В том числе сокращений по типу ""5П"", которые не сразу будут ясны новому игроку.). На первый взгляд он выглядит запутанным, но со временем вы привыкнете к нему. К счастью, он не такой перегруженный как в Stellaris. [/i]
    [*][i] Искусственный интеллект - иногда принимает странные решения. К примеру, ты накопил много Пыли (Местная валюта), он может предложить отдать все. С какой радости? Но в целом, он достаточно умен, чтобы бросить вам вызов. [/i]
    [*][i] Дополнения к игре запишу скорее в минусы, так как выходят сомнительными через один. Особенно вызывают вопросы такие дополнения как - Supremacy и Awakening. Подробнее о них расскажу в отдельных обзорах. [/i]
[/list]

[b] Вывод: [/b] [i] Играя Endless Space 2 ты забываешь о времени и погружаешься в мир космических приключений. Как и в любой 4х-стратегии, ты можешь сесть за нее и спустя десяток часов осознать, что провел весь день в этом мире. Она не идеальна, но её достоинства с лихвой перекрывают недостатки. Некоторые недостатки можно исправить, к примеру починить ИИ, в мастерской есть моды, что отлично справляются с этим. Но если ты решил поиграть с друзьями, то этот недостаток не будет заметен вовсе. Если вы любите космос и стратегии, то Endless Space 2 - это ваш выбор <З [/i] | 戦闘は陣形を設定したらあとは見てるだけだがそれが良い

76561197974286855,646570,Slay the Spire,482.8,"Indie, Strategy",23,"My first 500 hours in Slay the Spire were hours I didn't pay for. 

I was a kid in highschool, broke, there was only 3 characters in the game, Vine was alive and Tiktok had yet to really get a foothold in the world. It was a better time.

And I... sailed the seas. Its not something I'm ashamed of, and if you are down on your luck, still a kid, or just don't feel like jockeying the Steam refund policy to see if you like a game, most game devs would prefer thats how you play their game over buying a copy of dubious origin from a reseller. 

Why even bring this up, you might ask? Well, it was only last year that I realized how much had gone into the game, and that there was a 4th character that I had no clue even existed. And, against my better judgement with regards to my ever disappearing free time, I picked up STS again to try that 4th character. And then I started playing the other characters too. And then I started ascension runs. 

Never in all my days have I encountered such a well crafted deckbuilder. Being singleplayer, STS doesn't care if you find a combo that breaks the game and makes the enemy unable to interact with you. Slay the Spire doesn't try and limit your ceiling, it dares you to go infinite, it [i] wants [/i] you to go infinite. My favorite part of the game is how it encourages offense while putting more than enough wrinkles in your path that you can't just go full zerg rush. Fully indexing into any one thing without accounting for the counters puts you on the path to losing. 

Learning the Watcher, the illusive 4th character I didn't know existed as it got added after I put my 500 [strike] pirated [/strike] pre-purchase hours in has been one of the most enjoyable deckbuilding experiences I've had since... well since I played STS the first time. 

The main thing I was trying to do on the Watcher that was so fun was going infinite. There was a really interesting play pattern you can take where you reset a lot and chop your deck down to like 3 powers and then your 2 card combo that goes until you win. The fun part is that by taking your deck down to so few cards, any enemy that adds cards to your deck in any way is immediately the most threatening thing you could encounter. You also have to make illogical decisions in order to get to infinite. You skip like 90% of cards you are offered, you make sacrifices for some things that would never make sense in a normal run. And that is just ONE way to play the game on one character, completely ignoring everything that comes with ascension runs. 

And all of that is also completely ignoring everything that isn't purely gameplay. The art is amazing, the soundtrack is amazing, the sound DESIGN is amazing, and there has never been a better time to get into Slay the Spire because there is a sequel that looks like its amping up everything about the first game and giving more of what is undeniably one of the grandpappys of indie roguelikes. That would've been a silly statement 10 years ago, but there are so many indie roguelikes now that it can be hard to stand out among them. 

Slay the Spire has stood the test of time and remains at the top of the tower. Play this game, and if you can, uh, pay for it while you're at it... I did. Eventually.

---致我人生第一次玩的卡牌肉鸽神作《杀戮尖塔》
前几日冬促，购买了《杀戮尖塔》这款游戏，在玩之前心里曾想：我玩过那么多个3A大作，怎能会被一个小小的卡牌游戏震撼呢？看着steam好评如潮的评价，心里抱着不理解和尝试的态度，还是打开了游戏。

没错，我摊牌了，我彻底被这个游戏折服，从买完游戏到现在我无时不刻都在玩，目前也差不多一百小时了，如此优秀的游戏玩法和质量已经能超越很多3A大作。

再玩之前，我也确实久仰杀戮尖塔在卡牌肉鸽当中的地位，但是我也确实从来没玩过卡牌肉鸽，《杀戮尖塔》也属于我在肉鸽类游戏中的白月光了吧。确实只有在实际上手之后才能感受到其中的魅力。从最开始的重开在商店里找好遗物，到现在稍微有些对删牌过卡的理解，这种不完全依赖随机而是能够在游戏局内运营、构筑卡牌的机制正是它的魅力所在。同时四个角色特色迥异，相同角色又因为不同的牌组构筑有着不同的打法，再加上几乎毫无门槛的操作，在roguelike游戏的重开-学习的过程中，低挫败感、高成就感、对卡牌的熟悉以及逐渐对角色的理解使得游戏过程不像通常的卡牌roguelike，而更加有趣，能取舍是否该拿牌、是否该移除卡牌、接下来又该怎么构筑，这使该游戏的可重复游玩性大大增加。


前些天终于用战士，猎人和鸡煲把心脏打通关了，也算是对这游戏有些浅薄的理解了

开始玩这游戏的时候，好哥们建议我先玩鸡煲，说是鸡煲转起来特别强，而我也感受到了。

后来哥们和我说，玩战士得学会烧牌，我很诧异，明明每张牌都是我精挑细选的，为什么要把他们烧掉呢？后面理解了，把效率低的卡烧掉后，留下单卡效率最高的卡，打怪效率更高。之后喜欢上了烧牌的感觉，尤其很喜欢腐化，当把其他牌烧干净后，只剩下那几张攻击牌，颇有种破釜沉舟的感觉，就算打不过再sl嘛，把不该烧的牌留下来。

当我研究战士烧牌的时候，我认为战士是一个最需要想象力的职业，玩的时候得靠想象力。

关于杀戮尖塔的赞美太多太多了，我不想去赞美游戏的本身。我印象最深刻的一局是战士第一次打败心脏，因为卡组不太好，强度不高。我腐化黑拥SL一个小时二十次，结局依旧是输。我相信我能赢，我把29张牌牌序列出来，腐化黑拥烧完不同的牌牌序列出来，一个小时后我终于找到了那个解，最后我赢了之后长舒一口气。在那一刻我赢了游戏，在那一刻也赢了时间。或许一个小时我重开一局选牌好早赢了，可是能赢的局我不愿认输。


即使最后我们都会输给时间，这没关系，那也要谱写出每个人自己生命的赞歌。什么是生命的赞歌？或许是藏在人们骨子里的永不屈服、永不妥协、永不认输。

我的人生没办法sl，为了战胜这一路上的小怪，烧过那么多休息牌，娱乐牌，还换了那么多血，这是否真的值得？可惜这个问题的答案没法通过sl去知道了。
现在的我，就想赶快走到下一个篝火休息。人生啊，总是奔向下一个篝火，区别是以前的我会在篝火敲牌，以后我只会休息了。

最后感谢《杀戮尖塔》给我带来一百小时的快乐时光，我现在唯一后悔的就是在大学期末考试期间购买了这款游戏，这游戏真的有瘾啊！😭 | 又开始带鸡煲节奏了我真是服了😅鸡煲是这个游戏唯一的完美职业，已经和尖塔融为一体，成了尖塔的底层逻辑，成名绝技偏差认知给尖塔带来了这个贴吧最经典的话题，创造了尖塔的黄金时代，诋毁鸡煲，你想毁了杀戮尖塔吗？
 | Dangerous dangerous game, whether you are playing it on the go via tablet or have it on steam maybe with mods as well, if this is the right game for you your free time will evaporate. If you like deckbuilding, pve strategy and the like, this is just perfect. If you've got a background in competitive/multiplayer collectable card games, the pve nature of slay the spire enabling you to do some truly unbalanced things will make you ecstatic

If you're thinking of ""why bother getting this game when Slay the Spire 2 is going to come out soon?"", well this is already one of the best games of all time, don't be silly. | 仅仅是打了个全成就 ，仍然无法全面的评价这个游戏。因为这100个小时里仅仅专精了猎人，还有三个职业只是简单玩了玩。
真的有点惊叹于游戏的设计，仅仅四个角色，仅仅三个区域（算上心脏四个）却可以让一个游戏有着如此大的可玩性。看似重复的遭遇和地图，随着局内带来的各种惊喜（多种多样的道具，卡组搭配，药水选择，随机事件等）和精妙的设计（数值的平衡和关卡的平衡）可以说再玩几百个小时都不会觉得腻。而且这还是我没去更深体验其他三个角色和增加可玩性的mod时的想法。

☐ 模拟山羊 | Mais um ótimo jogo pra lista de parecidos com Left4Dead, focado em missões coop de atravessar mapas repletos de zombies e completar objetivos pelo caminho. O grande diferencial é que, assim como no filme, há hordas imensas de zombies em alguns momentos, e são tantos zombies que um vai subindo em cima do outro e criando uma montanha que alcança qlqr lugar alto e atravessa qlqr muralha!! Isso é mto divertido e o grande brilho do jogo, principalmente qndo vcê começa a atirar explosivos e ver a montanha de zombies se desfazendo e todos caindo conforme vcê explode os que estão mais embaixo. Também amei sair cortando multidões de zombeis com uma serra elétrica, é algo libertador pra alma, vcê se sente tão bem como se estivesse meditando.

Fora isso o jogo é bem dinâmico e viciante, e são 9 campanhas diferentes atualmente, sendo apenas 4 disponibilizadas com jogo principal e 7 disponibilizadas na versão completa. As outras duas só podem ser compradas separadamente (sim, é pra pegar o seu dinheiro mesmo). Cada campanha dura em média 1 hora na dificuldade mínima, e cada uma se passa em um lugar diferente do mundo, desde New York até Tokyo, as fases são todas únicas com relação aos cenários, e os mapas todos bem feitos e bem planejados, garantindo a diversão tanto nos momentos de correr de um lado pro outro e completar objetivos como também nos de defender a área das ondas de zombies por alguns minutos.

Outro ponto interessante é que além das armas normais, há armas especiais espalhadas pelo mapa (as que fazem BOOOM) e sempre há equipamentos de defesa nos pontos de guardar a área (tipo turrets, armadilhas de choque no chão e barreiras de arame) criando uma experiência única em cada fase que mistura a ação e adrenalina do Left4Dead com um pouco de tower defense estilo Orcs Must Die (“ótima” comparação).  No total vcê vai acabar gastando umas 15-20 horas até começar a enjoar, pois após concluir todos os níveis o que resta é o PVP (que nem testei) e o modo onda (que achei bem difícil e cansativo). O ponto positivo é que se vcê for jogar em grupo apenas o Host precisa comprar todas as DLCs, os demais só precisam do jogo base (até 4 pessoas); lembrando que pra funcionar precisa criar partida privada, se criar pública qm não tiver as DLCs vai ser expulso da sala automaticamente. Também gostei de poder selecionar qlqr personagem em qlqr fase, uma mudança agradável, já que qndo lançou só dava pra escolher entre os quatro personagens exclusivos de cada campanha. 

Por fim vale destacar o sistema de classes, com uma pitada de RPG pra aumentar de nível e liberar perks com diversos bônus usando pontos ganhos ao completar cada fase. As classes são bem úteis e qndo combinadas criam equipes devastadoras, e entre elas tem o medic (essencial pra sobrevivência não só com a cura, mas também com o boost de vida recarregável), o dronemaster (literalmente tem um drone que fica voando e protegendo o tempo todo) e várias outras com suas próprias peculiaridades e utilidades. Com isso recomendo bastante esse jogo aos fãs de Left4Dead e Back4Blood, é mais um jogo incrível e bem feito de zombies coop, só pra curtir e relaxar enfrentando hordas de mortos vivos ou pra passar raiva e se desafiar selecionando os modos de dificuldades mais altos e mutators, tem pra todo gosto. | 这游戏难度挺高，自己一个人玩容易失败，建议联机，但服务器又烂经常连不了，地图太少了，玩法就那些建议开工坊，但偶尔玩一玩杀杀僵尸爽一爽还是非常不错的 | Наверно так и должна выглядеть игра с Зомбаками, когда бывший союзник можешь стать твоим врагом и накинуться на тебя обратившись в зомби.
Когда толпа мчит на тебя, и ты отстреливаешь их руки и ноги, а они ползут желая лишь одного - тебя убить.
Когда лишь твоя меткость, отделяет бегущего к тебе союзника от неминуемой смерти, ведь за ним бежит орда, из тысячи тел.
Производит весьма потрясающее впечатление, и позволяет насладиться и вжиться во всё происходящее, будто бы находишься действительно там. Играя как от 3-го лица, так и от 1-го.

Конечно могу сказать, что багами игра тоже богата, как и весьма не многочисленным онлайном, и чаще всего в последнее время, приходиться искать людей.
Да здесь, множество персонажей, оружия и карт. Правда без DLC, только 4 миссии доступны, кроме того, всё же ставлю под сомнение разнообразие оружия, как то его меньше, чем хотелось бы, оружия ближнего боя так и вовсе практически нет. И разнообразием врагов, так же игра не богата. Да, многие зомбаки отличаются внешностью - что порадовало, но в целом, одно и тоже. Ну, могли бы немного покреативить, и сделать больше моделек для других врагов.
А в обороне, не возможно взять оружие выше 3-го уровня (всего 5).
Собственно Зомби-Слэшер, лучшее определение, для игры.

Однозначно игра нравится, но в силу своей Слэшерной направленности, и не открытого мира, а лишь выбора карт, игра спустя 2-3 часа начинает поднадоедать. 
Атмосфера передана как в фильме ""Война Миров Z"", и произвела хорошее впечатление. | Из всех кооперативных зомби-шутеров данный представитель жанра пришёлся мне по душе больше всех. Ни Aliens: Fireteam Elite, ни Back4Blood, ни даже дилогия Left 4 Dead, ставшая пионером подобных игр, не зашли мне так, как это сделала World War Z.

Базовая игра имеет 4 кампании по 3-4 главы в каждой. Бежим от точки А до точки Б, выполняя незатейливые похожие друг на друга поручения и делаем самое весёлое: отстреливаем многочисленные орды зомби. Прямо как в фильме с Брэдом Питтом, зомби несутся с огромной скоростью и забираются друг на друга, образуя тем самым лестницу. Оборонять точку, уничтожая буквально сотни зомби в каждом уровне, очень увлекательно. Поскольку игра недлинная и поддерживает кооператив, наскучить механики не успевают.

Понравилось разнообразие: каждый эпизод разворачивается в своей части мира, предлагая 4 новых персонажей. Прокачка по ходу прогрессии тоже выглядит интересной. Баланс что надо. Графика, анимации, работа серверов на высоте. Разве что иногда звук мог проседать, но это не страшно.
Кто-то может пожаловаться на то, что игра была попилена на длс, потому как после релиза вышло ещё 3 отдельных кампании, без которых основные проходятся всего за часов 7. Не могу судить, так как проходил окончательное издание. Отдельный респект за то, что дали пройти дополнительные эпизоды со мной другу, у которого они заблокированы.
В общем и целом, для кооперативных забегов игра очень даже крутая. Великолепно провели в ней время с другом. Рекомендую!"

They definitely tried. I would say they succeeded, but didn't really innovate on any mechanics to truly make it stand on its own. |  Final Fantasy tatics é uma parada q eu nunca joguei e ta travada em alguma coletânea de algum console aleatório (ou tu joga em emulador), mas o ponto é que eu não tenho como comparar nada, já que muita gente vem aqui ver se é talvez ""parecido"" com FFTatics.
  Pois bem, eu achei a experiencia nesse jogo muito boa, realmente queria saber o por que as pessoas gostavam tanto desse gênero, e me impressionei com a variedade de classe e ideias que se pode por em um personagem e nas composições, tem varias coisas secretas e um desafio bem equilibrado, eu só não platinei por ter muito grind e necessitar da DLC (Que eu não tenho).
 Concluindo, eu recomendo o jogo em alguma promoção (por que é meio salgado esse preço), já q ele tem uma historia bem interessante e personagens bem variados, alem de ser possível fazer uns combo bem cabuloso. | This is a good tactics game with some unique class leveling and combinations. | Slow, clunky, but a good Tactics RPG in general | This game really is a hidden gem. If you like strategy games, and particularly old school tactics like Final Fantasy Tactics and Vandal Hearts, I can highly recommend Fell Seal: Arbiter's Mark. While the first impact was not great, particularly in terms of graphics, the game grew on me quickly and within a few hours I knew I was dealing with a very solid title. 

The plot is alright, nothing spectacular but good enough for a game of this genre. Characters are overall likeable. Combat is well designed, maps are different and engaging. But where the game truly shines is the class system and the personalization available to the player. There's huge potential in finding combos, mixing abilities and really giving each unit a unique approach to combat. 

I'd give this game an overall 8 or even 8.5/10."

The world stage is very boring and there isn't much to do there apart from 'launch schemes' to get more cash. There's not much to do in your base beyond a certain point except make it prettier.  It's just kind of an unsatisfying gameplay loop once you scratch off the shiny paint. | Walk away to use the restroom and come back to your base on fire.

Simple logic isn't in the game. It's not a managment sim, it's a micro-managment sim. The minions are deaf, dumb, and blind. Resources don't seem balanced, making it difficult to maintain operation...

Like many others, I want to love this game but it is just to stupid. I'm done trying to have fun with it. | I liked the first game, and also oxygen not included and this war of mine. This sequel looks similar but somehow it gets very very boring after the iniial stages. No idea why. Luckily I got it on sale for only $1-2. | Логичное развитие первой части. Много приятных новшеств. Многие раздражающие механики из первой части убрали. Впрочем добавился ряд новых. 
Вообще игра как и первая часть нудновата. Но в целом хороший середнячек. | Super Spiel auch wenn ich den Ersten weit mehr gefeiert habe. Schade das der DLC von ersten hier auf Steam nicht verfügbar ist"

Not because there are more enemies or shorter days or less money or anything, the AI has just gotten so much stupider and buggier.

Squires and knights will randomly turn around during a portal attack, causing all the archers to go to the other side and just run into the portal. Squires/Knights will no longer try to get closer to the portal after being knocked back a bit causing the archers to be out of range of the portal and any squires/knights you brought from a previous island will sometimes randomly run off to the left (sometimes not even stopping for portals) to their death for no reason.

I really like the game, but given how buggy it has become I can no longer recommend it | Mindless fun with a friend, spend multiple hours basically just running around and watch as the builders run into battle with only hammer in hand and no means to defend himself, basically committing self die. | 好玩好玩好玩，就是几个地图虽然画风不同但玩法基本是重复的，不够带劲 | It's incredible how such a simple game can be so fun. I thought I'd spend about 10 hours playing this game, however, it's almost been over 100 hours, and it's been a blast. Great game! I highly recommend it. But please, Devs, fix the end-game bugs (DLC)—I need my ship back, and the last achievements are not being unlocked. | I really like it. Can be kind of frustrating sometimes with villagers/units not doing what you want them to do, but if you can get all the dlc in the sale and have a friend you can play it with, definitely get it.

Big tip: You don't both have to have the dlc to play multiplayer, only one player does. 
And if you host, make sure the person you are playing with as host has good wifi/ethernet because your friend will get kicked if that is not the case. Host has a lot of advantage in wifi/ethernet terms.

Also, check the wiki. You don't need it necessarily, but it is very useful if you don't want/can't figure a certain thing out. Can be a bit confusing since all of the kingdom games are hosted in one wiki.

TL;dr: Good game, play with good wifi having friend."

While I understand why, I also feel like this game is much more than just something that can fill the hole in your heart that you will feel after finishing [i]Baldur's Gate.[/i] A solid story is mixed with fun gameplay and really charming settings. This game has a sense of humor about itself that is also very appreciable, as it adds to the distinct charisma of it.

On one hand, I appreciate that the game doesn't hold your hand as much although on the other I did find myself lost and directionless at different points. 

The cast of characters that accompany you on your adventure are interesting and have their own unique stories that are fun to explore. The multiplayer aspects, while I didn't explore them for much time, were very fun. It would definitely be fun to play with a group of friends. All in all, a fun game that deserves its own reputation rather than falling into the shadow of Larian's newest and most successful title. | 开放世界地图，队伍四个人物，能打反应元素，可以神像复活，对话不能跳过，椅子可以入座，是原神2没错！ | venho do bg3. depois de fazer umas 10 runs completas resolvi jogar divinity e simplesmente acheiaté msm melhor q o bd3, só perde em gráficos e em algumas mecânicas(pulo, poder resetar e mudar classe principalmente), mas consegui ver muitos mais prós do que contras, oq mais se destaca é o sistema de batalha por turno que usa pontos de ação ao invés de ação principal/secundaria(e os pontos de magia q tbm só consomem pontos de ação no divinity) que torna o jogo muito mais dinâmico, resumidamente se vc gostou muito de bg3 que nem eu vc provavelmente vai amar esse jogo | Прекрасная игра, эмоции от развязки после окончательного выбора и занавеса полностью отбивают эти 100 часов которое заняло полное прохождение, включая решения проблем напарников-друзей -- Гнумыча, Лоусе и Дракончика.

Great game, but for me most of the weakneses are majorly updated for Baldurs Gate III, which if you are looking to play or try just one RPG High fantasy game w turn based combat go with BG3. If you like come back DOSII.

76561197974286855,717640,Reigns: Her Majesty,3.9166666666666665,"Casual, Indie, Simulation",1,"（下面有大量劇透）

玩家扮演一個陷入無限輪迴、權力受到宰制的王后，協助國王處理政務
日常處處受限、步步為營，具體表現在需要維持宗教、民生、軍事、財政四項指標的平衡，避免過高或過低，否則會觸發死亡結局
王后死亡後便輪到新一任的王后，每次舊王后的死亡是新王后的誕生，繼承前任王后的物品和人際關係
基本玩法是左右滑動卡片，兩邊設置不同的選項，每個選項影響不同指標的數值，同時決定故事走向，推進故事發展
本質是解謎遊戲，完成遊戲佈置的任務，解決決鬥室的謎題，解鎖新卡片、新人物，升級獲得的新道具，最後達成真結局
把特定道具扔給卡片人物，或者跟特定角色締結友好關係，多少挽回四項指標見底或全滿的末路
譬如，香水扔給主教可抵擋一次宗教指標見底的BE，結交博士建哲學塔可抵擋一次民生指標全滿的BE

中世紀奇幻世界觀，集合了基督教、女巫信仰、煉金術士、吸血鬼等西方奇幻常見元素
遊戲有聊勝於無的後設元素，真結局揭露的真相不明所以
玩家作出的部分決策，偶爾彈出統計數據，對比其她王后（玩家），告知這個選項所佔百分比
卡片人物偶然跳出來吐嘈玩家，跟玩家交流

遊戲採用莫名其妙的星座元素，雖然契合中世紀背景，綜觀遊戲內容，卻不見得星座元素的設計有何巧妙之處
我對神秘學毫無興趣，不清楚星座符號及其意涵，只覺得每次開局記住星座符號很麻煩
決鬥室其中一個謎題跟塔羅牌有關，「愚人」的謎底是「青年俊傑踏征程」
遊戲製作人真以為所有人都認識塔羅牌嗎？我能成功是使用刪除法，一個一個測試和除錯

中文翻譯太爛了，普通文本諸多缺漏，語句不通順，也就罷了
決鬥室的謎題翻譯得不知所云，阻礙玩家理解，影響遊戲體驗，實在不能忍

[h2] 女性與權力 [/h2]

這是一款面向女性玩家的遊戲，以女性為中心發展的故事，大結局也揭示了這一點
王后可以資助女性健康方面的研究，學習侍女們獨創的秘密語言，選用女性軍官帶領軍隊
遊戲有一些關於女權主義的幽默笑話，蜻蜓點水式的玩梗，並非認真對待
為什麼女權主義女神是一個男性角色呢？

女性角色的數量不少：除了王后、侍女、貴婦人等傳統女性身份，還有刺客、勇士、海盜、女巫、商人、博士、煉金術士等各種各樣身份的女性
當中有的可以結盟，有的成為朋友，有的可以發展同性戀情
人物設計簡化，外觀由大面積的色塊構成
女性角色外型總有一些刻板印象元素來凸顯這是女性，例如長髮、粉紅色、胸部性徵等等
這種設計部分是符合背景，基於上流社會女性的裝扮要求
可是，女巫、女神、煉金術士等虛構身份的女角色，不需要女性刻板印象的設計

雖然是女性主角的遊戲，但不代表是女性友好
遊戲使用一些如蛇蠍女、最毒婦人等等的厭女詞彙
當王后暗殺國王，便會得到最毒婦人的新卡片
男人手刃多少人類，也沒有得到最惡毒的評價，反而把髒水潑到女性身上了

遊戲不乏虐待女性的元素，顯而易見是王后的死亡輪迴
設計出花樣百出的女性死亡方式，似有玩弄女性死亡和品嚐女性苦難之慊
遊戲為無盡的死亡結局賦予一些特殊意義，背後邏輯是女性必須受苦受難才能獲得安息和解脫

遊戲世界是貶抑女性的父權社會，處於女人是男人附屬品，女性地位低下的時代，存在諸多性別歧視
王后被要求做個安守本分的貴族婦女，即使王后身份高貴，仍然不得進入某些僅限男性的地方

左右滑動的玩法會陷入假兩難的局面，譬如遊戲常見的身體意象議題
主教叫王后不要穿著暴露，玩家只能在順從或別管我二選一
前者遵從傳統保守的好女人規訓，後者看似有主見但是自由男權那一套的自由論調
選前者會被傳統男權噁心到，選後者會被自由男權噁心到，還可以有其她選擇的呀！

主角是王后，也就是國王的女人，主角身份必定會沾男，跟男人打交道
王后負責的事情，除了一般政務，還要處理國王的關係，宮廷人情世故，還有一些瑣碎事情
即使國王昏庸無能碌碌無為，政事由王后主理，國王的權力仍高於王后，能夠決定王后的生死
當軍事指標全滿，王后便會被國王以保護之名，行禁錮之實，一生失去自由

女性奪權之路依舊建基於依附男人權勢地位的前設上
王后想要奪權，一種是國王意外死亡，另一種是生下兒子再暗殺國王
兩種方式都顯得被動、迂迴，有別於直接的政治鬥爭
前者不是王后主動爭取，而是臨危受命，不可不為之
後者王后需要迎合父權規則，方能實現個人野心
遊戲的設定是女性需要依附男人，做丈夫的妻子和兒子的母親才能間接得到權力
按照史實的話，鼎鼎大名的伊莉莎白一世終生未婚，製作組大可以設定主角一開始就是權傾天下的女王
為什麼遊戲採取王后身份這種局限性的設定呢？遊戲編劇Leigh Alexander的遊戲理念便是答案
她認為權力幻想很無聊，女王直接影響國王而非王國會更有趣
這不就是男人征服世界，女人征服男人的男權幻想敘事嗎？難怪主角要沾男了

[h2] 繁瑣的遊戲性 [/h2]

卡片隨機性是遊戲的一大缺點，雖然能增加一些耐玩度，但長期而言是折磨玩家的設定
遊戲每次輪迴，隨機抽取卡片，跟遊戲角色互動
一開始接觸有新鮮感，玩久了便感到乏味無聊，越來越煩厭
隨機事件重重複複，角色互動單調無趣，變相浪費時間

遊戲設置的謎題，需在特定星座才可觸發事件，要是錯過了，便要再來一個輪迴
雖然可到迷宮更改星座，但進入迷宮事件本就有隨機性，不一定如願進入迷宮
即使轉到特定星座，也因為卡片的隨機性，不一定會出現想要的結果
很有可能遇不到特定角色便掛掉，硬生生錯過了事件，又要再來一個週期的輪迴
這一系列的操作流程，非常惱人且火大，消磨玩家的耐性
比方說，去見森林女王的條件是巨蟹座時代找到狐狸，千辛萬苦等到了巨蟹座，卡片隨機生成，不能保證可以碰到狐狸，或會沒維持好四個指標就掛掉了，又要重新轉到巨蟹座找狐狸

大結局破關後該輪迴結束，刪除當下的記錄，重新開始遊戲：升級的道具全部消失，又要重新解開層層重疊的謎團
遊戲基本的save load功能也沒有，想要刷三個大結局，便要重玩三次
每一次輪迴起碼需時兩三個小時，一點也不方便玩家

[h2] 遊戲感想 [/h2]

我一周目不怎麼看攻略打了END1，三四個小時的遊戲體驗良好，怎料越玩越雷人，越玩越火大
在知曉大部分謎題的情況下，我開始二周目，很快便被遊戲的隨機性噁心到
就算懂得謎團破解的方法，也不知道能否抽到卡片，不知道能否遇到事件，難以預料到底花多少時間
遊戲實在太坑了！超級賭爛卡片隨機性+維持四個指標+特定星座觸發事件疊滿的噁心設置
這種隨機性設計違反了多勞多得熟能生巧的常理，簡直是噩夢，為什麼要這樣設計呢？
我眼睜睜看著一堆重複又重複的文字，感受只得煩厭和暴躁可言
刷卡片刷到我懷疑人生，玩這個遊戲有什麼意義呢？

更噁心的事件來了，遊戲的重要道具火槍，獲得條件是必須跟國王生兒子，女兒不行
女兒生下來後，選擇送到城裡或教會，結果都是差不多，一定要生下兒子當繼承人才能觸發事件
這個噁心的設定跟男權世界觀脫不了關係，只得男人才有繼承權
這個周目的王后輪迴了不知多少次都是生女兒，當我看到王后生下女兒，感到非常失望
因為我知道要廢檔了，這次輪迴不能要了，我又要重新刷過，於是立即弄掛了王后
我刷了不知道多少遍，等到王后終於生下了兒子，我感到十分欣喜，終於可以推進劇情了
這個遊戲一定是父權人快樂模擬器，讓我狠狠地體驗了墮女追男的感受
遊戲重現了父權制度對女性生育的壓迫，還得是玩家自己親自動手的，驚不驚嚇？
本來我還在猶豫應否給遊戲正評，畢竟遊戲在女性意識方面並非一無是處，這下子毫不猶豫選擇負評了

我為了刷真結局白白浪費時間在刷卡片、走迷宮、生兒子（沒錯是兒子）
最後我把全部道具都升到滿級，這次一定能打到真結局吧？
怎料我手快快按掉了「別跟我爭了」那一句，遊戲便結束輪迴，這個周目的記錄已被刪除
我又要重新打一次，但一想到隨機性的折磨，各種各樣不爽的設定，與其重玩一次，不如拿這些時間來寫評論

When I had just bought this game, as I was looking at its global achievements, I was wondering why only 10% of the players had got to the end; but when you start playing, it's obvious why.
Not Tonight is
- overly long: chapter 1 of Not Tonight consists of 30 days, while the entirety of Papers Please is less than that;
- too grindy, repetitive and tedious, due to its length and its health system;
- not emotional at all: as your rating is based on your speed, you are forced to rush through days and can barely glance at the few recurring characters who sporadically appear in the game.
I reached week 2 of chapter 2 and I think I'll drop this. It's not worth it imo. | Having fun 'til now, but really, the load system is confusing as hell, and made me lose saves already."
76561197974286855,736850,We. The Revolution,0.8333333333333334,Strategy,1,"An absolutely incredible game, one that deserves far more recognition. The artwork is breathtaking, with a striking, angular style that perfectly captures the turmoil of Revolutionary France. The story is just as remarkable—layered, morally complex, and filled with weighty decisions that make every trial feel like life or death. Alexis Fidèle is a phenomenal (and hot) protagonist, full of nuance and internal conflict, making it easy to get lost in his journey through power, corruption, and justice.

The core gameplay—handling trials, interrogating witnesses, and balancing your relationships with various factions—is deeply immersive. It's one of the best implementations of choice-driven storytelling I’ve seen, blending narrative and mechanics seamlessly. Every verdict carries weight, forcing you to constantly reconsider your morals and strategy. It’s a hidden gem in the world of narrative-driven games.

And yet, despite all of this brilliance, I cannot recommend We. The Revolution.

The game falls apart in Act 3 due to an incredibly frustrating, poorly designed combat system that feels completely disconnected from the rest of the experience. The battles are tedious, imbalanced, and, worst of all, essential to progress. If you fail too many times, you can end up completely soft-locked from reaching the ending, rendering all of your careful decisions meaningless. The lack of an option to bypass or mitigate this makes it a glaring flaw that tarnishes an otherwise masterful game. I brute forced my way due to my love for this game, but alas I could not expect others to suffer the same.

It’s heartbreaking, really. We. The Revolution comes so close to being an unforgettable experience, but Act 3’s combat turns it into an exercise in frustration. If you’re willing to push through—or use external workarounds—you’ll find an incredible story worth experiencing. But as it stands, I can’t wholeheartedly recommend it, no matter how much I want to | Un jeu en demie teinte.

Un concept qui change de ce qu'on a l'habitude de voir, des graphismes bien réalisés. On peut, avec un peu d'habileté, concilier bon jugement et vie politique.

Lors d'une réduction, ça reste un jeu à ajouter à votre bibliothèque. | I do not understand what I am supposed to do. Furthermore the story is not very clear.

76561197974286855,291650,Pillars of Eternity,1.1666666666666667,RPG,0,"Pillars of Eternity is an outstanding throwback to the golden age of RPGs, successfully blending rich storytelling, intricate world-building, and deep character customization. From the very first moments, you're immersed in a beautifully crafted world full of history, intrigue, and lore that feels alive and vibrant. The developers at Obsidian have clearly poured their hearts into creating a game that doesn’t just tell a story, but invites you to shape it through meaningful choices and engaging dialogue.

The combat system is a perfect mix of strategy and real-time action, offering a tactical challenge that feels rewarding. The diverse range of abilities and character builds ensures that no two playthroughs are the same. There's also a level of depth in how you interact with the world—everything from your party's backstories to the lore of the land is fleshed out and the consequences of your actions reverberate throughout the entire game.

The narrative in Pillars of Eternity is a true highlight. The game handles themes of life, death, reincarnation and the nature of the soul with nuance and sophistication while presenting a world that feels lived-in and grounded. The overarching story is truly gripping with rich dialogues making each interaction feel impactful.

Graphically, the game uses a beautiful,  hand drawn isometric art style that makes the world feel both timeless and distinct, reminiscent of old classic RPGs like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape: Torment. The environments are detailed, and the use of lighting and atmosphere brings the world to a higher level. Its art direction more than compensates for any technical shortcomings.

Overall, Pillars of Eternity is a must-play for fans of old school cRPGs, or anyone who loves a good story paired with a deeply immersive world. With a vast, intricate world to explore, tactical combat to master, and an engaging narrative that constantly rewards exploration, it’s a game that stands the test of time and remains one of my favorite RPGs of the last decade. | Masterpiece unfortunately hidden behind a slow and uninteresting start. Top notch world, characters, and story, with a mostly good real time with pause combat system behind it. This feels like the real spiritual successor to the Baldur's Gate games, unlike the actual BG3 which is more akin to a Dragon Age Origins. I played this directly after BG1 and was actually shocked at how faithful Pillars feels to those games. I'm gonna give this five big booms on the boom meter. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! | The world that Obsidian built is great, the main quest, the side-quests, everything ties in very well and feels like a cohesive piece of art.

Where the game fails a bit is the game-play. During combat it's hard to track what is happening, and even though I completed a game, I never felt confident and as if I mastered the game's mechanics. Something that is usually a reward itself in crpgs.
The art-style left a bit confused, on one side, the game is beautiful, on the other it was so hard for me to discern characters from the background, or even one character from the other. In many encounters I couldn't figure out where each companion stands, and I had to rely only on their avatars.
Also, the story deliver and a bunch of text, lore and hard-to-remember names made the game much harder to enjoy.

Once it all settles down in your mind, you can enjoy it more. I almost feel bad that I played this game now after the resurgence of crpgs, because I feel time-pressure to play all those games (Pathfinder, Deadfire, D:OS). If I played this game when it came out, I'm sure I would've played it at much slower pace and gave myself more time to learn all the mechanics and read every sentence that was written. But this is on me, nothing is stopping me to do this right now. | 游戏里rp死神嗣被贝拉斯讨债，游戏外在延伸白茫冻得倒欠3万字。

It's interesting to see how the character you create will grow their own personality and relationships with the other characters.
A little downside, some of the dialogues feel weird or make no sense at times. | Wildermyth is a simply amazing game. The gameplay is fun and really easy to pick up, allowing you a much lighter & quicker character building experience without needing the deep time sink that many games do (though I also enjoy that). The procedural story generation system can occasionally lead to some oddities but all in all makes for a very fun and replayable experience! 

I also love the concept of adventures spanning multiple generations, and characters becoming too old to fight. it adds an element of scale and realism to the adventures that I really appreciate. A great game for Strategy & RPG Newcomers or vets looking for a deep and replayable experience! | I love this game.

Don't let the art style keep you from trying it. It took me a while to warm up to it, but i think it actually suits the game very well.

EDIT EDIT: A lot of the most popular mods on the workshop seem to work just fine. So, I may have been hasty in my original post | An inferior Total War: Shogun with blobby combat and unresponsive units - Which is par for the course for modern total war.

Something strange happened to the Total War franchise after the engine change i  Total War Rome 2. Suddenly every combat encounter is a bunch of segmented blobs with no coherency. Nothing is different in Total War Three Kingdoms. This means you can pretty much  segment Total War into the good games before the engine change and the bad ones after.

The unit and faction variety is about the same as in Total War Shogun, with the addition of 'Hero Characters' like in Total War Warhammer. These hero characters are overpowered and add to the problem of just blobbing everything together. 

Supposedly this game has the best diplomacy of any Total War and with a proper 'End Game'. This seems to be a lie. The end game is the same as every other Total War in that a 'Realm Divide' happens which makes every faction hate you.

If you're someone who likes modern Total War this game is more of the same but now with chinese people.

76561197974286855,837400,Fated Kingdom,0.0,"Indie, RPG, Simulation, Strategy",0,"So, I have 60+ hours in on this game and I have to say, it's been a lot of fun. I started streaming Fated Kingdom over a month ago. Since then I have made some new friends and discovered a whole new affection for board games.

Yes, there are things worth discussing,  like the interpretation from Russian to English. There are also some phrasing or wording points that may seem unclear at first. Reaching out to the developers has helped a lot. The developers are still very active in the games development. From bug fixes to Rule updates. And they are quick to respond to questions on Steam and Discord. 

The game is  meant to be a cooperative experience.  2 to 4 players work together to save the kingdom of Kinmarr from the dark forces that are battling to bring it to ruin. Each player represents a different guild. The guilds may not trust each other but agree to put aside their differences to rescue Kinmarr.

There are five guilds. Knight, Pathfinder, Follower, Heir, and Watcher. Each has there own lore and unique abilities. I've played them all and it's very hard to pick a favorite.

The misconception that this game is in someway a cash grab  is disheartening.  Because the rules or certain tasks are not AI enforced does not diminish the game in any way.

 The rules are well developed. The English rules are of Russian translation.  I've played with enough people, who are familiar with the game, to learn that everyone has their own style of play.  It's what I would call 'House Rules'. The developers intended it to be this way. Even they will play the game in different alterations. They  even include an 'Official Fated Kingdom Editor Guide' with the installation. With this tool you can edit cards, tiles, guilds, and the rules.

You can play the game  as Co-op, PVP , or  teams. In fact, the game can start out as a co-op and any one or more players can decide to go rogue. After all, these guilds do have a history of distrust among each other. I have yet to actually play a full game in co-op because somebody always decides to go rogue. Then there are games I have played in pvp  between two players. 

The game changes each time you play. There is random tile placement and a resetting of all 4 decks. There are also cards that can flip the entire game over on it's head. There are four decks, Encounter Cards, Skill Cards, Item Cards, and Prophecy Cards. Over 200 cards in all that take the game in many directions.

In ways, Fated Kingdom reminds me of board games I played years ago where there was no AI. You had a rule book and your imagination. How many people grew up putting a $500 bill in the center of the Monopoly board to cover Free Parking? It's called House Rules. Almost everyone has their own House Rules for the games they love. The most important thing about House Rules is that everyone is on the same page before the game starts. Over the past few weeks of streaming and playing Fated Kingdom, I created my own House Rules. It has nothing to do with poorly written rules. It has everything to do with players personalizing the game experience.

For example; After a long discussion over Tower Cards, a couple of us thought of adding a House Rule.. When drawing a Tower Card, you can keep it as long as you have the value of the card in Creature Cards to buy it. There are times where a player is 'directed' to draw a Tower Card. What if he cannot afford to buy it? The rules would have you return it to the bottom of the deck. In our discussion, we talked about the possibility of the card going up for auction. 

In another instance, a player can be directed to pay silver to another player or back to the kingdom. What happens if he doesn't have the amount? The rules would have you ignore this and move one. We discussed other options. Such as the player goes into debt and must pay as he gains any new silver. Another was increasing Fate by the same number he owes. A third option was that the player taking a wound for each silver he owes. (The third was my suggestion and a very bad one to boot). The point is, the game allows for this as a House Rule or even as an edit, as  intended.

Not having the AI search for a specific card during game play has been called  a setback to the game. For instance, you can be directed to search for a specific Guild Card, or Creature Card. To manually search for the card is not an issue, for me.  It was not in issue in any match I have played, for me or other players.  I remember that Fated Kingdom is an 'old school', digital board game. It's a little hands on. It's NOT an AFK game or Idle Clicker and never claims to be. For me, the very last thing I want is a game that plays itself. And if I am attracted to a digital board game, a big part of it has to do with the art, look, and virtual feel of the game. So I have to go through a few cards? So what? I like the sound they make when you flip them and lay them down to be honest.

Yes, there are opportunities where you are directed to name a specific card. It may be to obtain that card, use it, or look for it. You can access the library of all the cards 'before' game play but not during. The developers designed it this way. I have had more players know exactly what card they wanted or needed to name than players who couldn't name one. This is the difference between a real player or a casual player. It is not a defect in the design of the game. I ask, in what card game is it not to a players advantage to know all there is to know about a card. To put this in perspective; Magic the Gathering has over 20,000 cards. Hearthstone has 2,496 playable cards. Fated Kingdom has 200.

As for lag in the game, I have experienced little to none. I have played a few people who have said their lag was a little annoying but not a game changer. Most of the time a simple restart of the game seems to fix it.

To sum it all up, you need to experience the game yourself and come to your own conclusion. Yes, there are rules to read. And each guild has different attributes to remember. Sometimes you have to re-roll the same dice because there is no duplicate. And it's beneficial to learn and know the cards. These are not things that lessen the fun or depth of game-play. It's old school. Enjoy it.

I hope this review is helpful to anyone who is looking to own the game.  And if you do pick it up, look for me in the lobby. My games are always public. I am usually streaming. And I try to keep it fun and entertaining. | Отличная настолка, очень вариативная. Она отличается от привычных компьютерных настолок тем, что там ничего не происходит автоматически, сами игроки берут и сбрасывают карты, передвигают фигуры, бросают кубики, т.е не по нажатию кнопки, а как если бы Вы играли в настоящую настолку.

[b]4 года назад[/b] за автором закрепился титул ""Game Master настольных игр"".
Так как на портале sc2tv [strike](ныне peka2tv)[/strike] в рубрике Prime-Time 3.1 была представлена вниманию ""Desperate Gods: Diablo"", сделанная на основе открытого кода настольной ""Desperate Gods"" [strike](которая в свою очередь сделана на движке Unity)[/strike]. Автор подошёл к делу крайне отвественно, что позволило игре развиваться и после окончания Prime Time 3.1.


С того момента [b]прошёл год[/b] и на портале sc2tv появилась рубрика Prime-Time 4.0, где автор снова принял участие, показав ""Desperate Ghosts"" - игру для Tabletop Simulator. Прописаный мир, интересный и реиграбельный геймплей - вот, что ждало игроков [strike](разумеется после приобретение симулятор игрового стола)[/strike].

[b]И вот,[/b] после работы над ""Desperate Gods: Diablo"" и ""Desperate Ghosts"" [strike](и ещё одним проектом похороненным из-за нарушения авторских прав)[/strike] автор не заставил, поклонников его работы, долго ждать. В прочем, я так и думал, что всё это задел к чему-то большему и независимому [strike](только попробуйте перенести в tts!)[/strike]. Пройдя путь, через терни к звёздам, группа молодых авантюристов, в количестве двух штук, явила миру творение, которого я ждал с начала разработки.

Игра содержит, как и старое знакомое для бывалых настольщиков, так и новое неизведанное, ведь механика/геймплей не стоит на месте. Даже небольшое отличие от прошлых работ подогревает интерес, чтобы пощупать это добро на деле.

Teşekkürler | The touch version has been able to provide a decent FM experience without having to pour hundreds of hours into a single save. I play a single nation game on a Surface Go which seems ideal for it, the gameplay experience is fine and doesn't drain the battery within an hour. 

Not without it's faults, it's lacking some features I used to like (notably team talks) and there are the unpopular micro-transations so you can pay to win, but you don't have to use them. 

Would recommend for old people like me who don't have the time for a proper game of FM because of real world responsibilities. | FM Touch 19 returns the Football Manager series to its simplified and glorius best in a streamlined version of the main game. 

This edition captures the essence of the earlier games in the series (say FM05-FM10), with a focus mainly on match tactics and squad building. 

Scouting and training are present but in a much more simplified and user friendly manner compared to the main game, whilst frustating interactions like teamtalks and player conversations are removed entirely.

There is also an added benefit that the game processes much faster than the main version, allowing those who may be time limited the opportunity to have more meaningful managerial careers.

Certainly, if you are a player who may have fallen out of love with the newer versions of the main game, this may well be the perfect way to rekindle your football managerial affair.

 | Ich habe lange überlegt ob ich etwas schreiben sollte..!?

Vorweg, ich bin ein absoluter Fußballmanager Fan..
Aber ein eingefleischter EA Manager Freund.. Für mich war & ist es noch immer ein unverständlicher Alptraum ohne diesen Manager..
Eine ewigkeit habe ich auf einen neuen Manager gehofft.. 
Nun gibt es einen..
ABER, ich bin ein Manager Fan, für den das drum herum auch dazu gehört. Das beinhaltet dann auch den Stadionbau, die Infrastruktur usw.
All das vermisse ich hier.. Dennoch habe ich dieses Spiel gekauft und ihm eine Chance gegeben..
Es gibt viele Details in diesem Spiel die ich sau geil finde.. Z.B. die Transfergeschichten, Beurteilungen etc.
Zu viel Detailtiefe und möglichkeiten, finde ich persönlich, machen das Spiel aber eher kaputt. Ich will auch nicht gefühlt ne Stunde an der Taktik feilen..
Scheinbar bin ich auch zu blöd für diese Variante des Detailtiefen Managers!? 
Ich habe jetzt gefühlt schon eine ewigkeit an Stunden damit verbracht, mit meiner Lieblingsmannschaft oder einem eigenen gegründeten Verein die deutschen Ligen aufzumischen.. Doch egal wie oft ich auch gespielt habe, egal wie viele Top Transfers ich vollbracht habe, egeal mit welcher Aufstellung oder Taktik ich spiele, ich VERLIERE..!!! :(
Ich gebe es auf.. Habe die Lust und freude verloren.. 
Wie gesagt, es gibt viele Dinge die mir hier gefallen, aber ebenso viele die ich hasse.. 
Grafisch ist echt nicht viel zu erwarten, was ich zwar vermisse, aber ggf. drüber hinwegsehen könnte, wenn der Rest passen würde.. Nun habe ich ja auch die abgespeckte Touch Version gekauft, weil ich ersteinmal probieren wollte.. Jetzt zusätzlich noch einmal die Vollversion zu kaufen um mich vielleicht doch noch positiv davon überzeugen zu lassen, sehe ich nicht ein.. Da bin ich zu geizig für..

Lots to explore, 12 hours in on first playthrough i probably touched the surface
Interesting worldbuilding and cool systems
Can be very addictive once you've gotten used to the system

Cons: 
- Many tasks feel like grinding. A lot of repetitiveness, be it work, reading books or studying skills. E.g. to improve your [spoiler]  ""reason"" [/spoiler] skill you have to  combine 8 [spoiler] ""Erudition"" [/spoiler]  which takes 60 seconds each to combine, and 60 seconds to make, all on timers before they run out... 

- The way cards get added to your field sucks ass and is beyond annoying, just dumping them wherever with no possibility to have a dedicated place for a certain type of card. Let me have all books in one place, all vitality in another etc... being unable to stack cards with different timers is also extremly annoying and creates a mess all the time. 

Overall, a 6/10 which would be probably a 7 or 8 if the quality of life wasn't so miserable at points.

文本观赏性很强，非常洛式风味，好吃！ | This game is a passionate love affair I keep coming back to.  It's not something I recommend to everyone (honestly I don't think any game is, but this one is more ""has a highly specific target audience"" than most) - you have to be some combination of a fiddly detail obsessive, wiki-diver, and opaque lore-enjoyer to really get the most out of it.  

Watching the previews will give a decent sense of the actual gameplay, which I would have difficulty describing, but the *feeling* of playing the game can't really be communicated as easily, I think.  Cultist Sim is incredibly atmospheric, and a lot better at creating interesting tension than a few gameplay clips can really convey.  The timer progression is such an integral part of not just the mechanics, but the mood.  Is your current Dream action (20 seconds remaining) going to turn up the card you need to dispel part of the Fascination counter (45 seconds remaining) currently spelling your doom?  etc.  

Also, it pays to actually read the descriptive text on things - it will all sound like pretentious bullshit at first, but there is a kind of shockingly cohesive, deep, and interesting setting and story going on, here, behind all the timer-watching.

My one main criticism is that it is really, really bad at teaching you how to play it.  I'd recommend spending a few minutes on youtube to help get the basics down; there are a lot of aspects of the game that are satisfying to find out in an exploratory manner, but the basics of stuff like, how to recruit and promote Followers are not that.  Thankfully, the fan wiki is also excellent, and basically an essential resource if you get in deep. | [h2] 片手間でやれるように盤面を整えると想定外のミスで死ぬゲーム（1敗） [/h2]

ゲーム性としては基本的に如何に手早くアガるかというゲームであるとともに、記号化・暗喩化された表現から最適解をひねり出すという若干の水平思考が求められる。このゲームは基本的に「何をやりたいか？」はプレイヤーに丸投げされており、過程を楽しむゲームというよりも過程の途中で得られる結果を回収して「ああこういう事なのね」という断片収集を楽しむものである。

カルト教団を運営する要素よりも、うたい文句の""禁断の宝を手に入れ、神々を召喚して、弟子を食い尽くす”ことが根幹にある。なので召喚獣は割とコンスタントに出すことになるし、民間人はボタン一つで拉致してヤバそうな噂と引き換えに神様とアクセスできる上級リソースのひとつでしかない。

なので、場末のカルトがひーこらいって生贄を手に入れて、奉仕種族に神の御姿を重ねる盲人の象くらいの感覚でいると100％のマンサスパワーを食らい魅了により焼き殺されるため注意しよう。このゲームにおけるプレイヤーの目的は多かれ少なかれ上位存在とバチバチに接触する点にあり、解脱なり聖人化なりなんなりして人間をやめるための長丁場の工程を見てるというゲームである。クソ長い週刊少年ジャンプの修行編だけで構成された話と言えるかもしれない。ちなみに私はDLCクリア直前、管理をミスって発狂したためリアルでも発狂しかけた。"

Its alright, theres just better out there including  in the franchise | Years of XCOM franchise and worldbuilding gone to waste through typical American hero action movie vibes and limited gameplay. The game is repetitive, too long for the same ol' same ol' type of writing it introduces, and it's progression is very limited.

Best time to buy this game is at a large discount, otherwise chances are you will regret it. | The gameplay is great. XCOM, but your cops in the aftermath of the invasion. Where it differes greatly is the characters, specifically, their characters that were created and each have unique abilities. It's a shorter game than the other XCOMs, so it makes sense, and all the characters are unique and pretty fun. However if you have come here for the store, it's kind of just okay. It's nothing horrible, it's just bland. 

If you really like XCOM gameplay, it's a fun mix of gameplay. If you're here for an interesting story, than this isn't gonna do it. It's not as hard as the other XCOMs, but that doesn't mean it's easy. | bleh. This game is like ""We have XCOM 2 at home"" walmart off-brand version. Just a massive letdown compared to both it's predecessors. I know people say that this game isn't a true successor to XCOM 2 and that's it's apples to oranges, but these apples are spoiled with worms in them. I can't recommend it | As a long time X-Com fan I felt offended by this product. I can’t call it a game. A game, by definition is an activity that one engages in for amusement or fun, This  is not engaging, arguably fun. This is a product created, packed and sold with the minimum effort just to pursue a specific agenda and, unfortunately, has the name of a very cool franchise on it.
The ONLY “ok” aspect of this product is the gameplay. Breaching games are extremely rare and the idea of having an alien and human swat team doing police business it was interesting and it was the biggest appeal for me. Small maps, quick actions, repetitive gameplay loop but with different variations? Why not. Troubleshooter is one of my favorite game and it doesn’t even have a breach mode.
Too bad the rest of the product is awful. It’s not “bad”, it’s “awful”. If you want a TLDR and you get the reference, this product can be called “X-Com Velma (2023 HBO)”.
You no longer have a squad of nobodies who are trying their best to save the world, you have a pre-selected team of aliens and humans which are only walking tropes, generally uninteresting, assholes or constantly judging hypocrites. Or any combination of the former. The “characters” interactions are just Marvel quipping (in missions and during rest time) and they have no in-between moral position. They are “I am so tolerant look at me” “I was on your side all the time” “I didn’t deserve this” or “I am a dumb racist”. You can say I’ve played two hours so I can’t really judge an eventual “character development”. No wait I have internet, I can because I’ve read everything about this product so yeah I can judge.
They made me hate a snake lady. I will never forgive them for this.
Also those awful portraits and general art style. Just why. And why they changed the mutton this much? This is X-Com not Lilo and Stich.
But that’s not even the worst point. No, the worst point is the only moral of the product: RACISM BAD. Now don’t put out the pitchforks yet. There is a teeny bitsy little thing to add.
RACISM (against the aliens that enslaved humanity, killed literally millions, put people in concentration camps and use them as food or slave labor or genetic experiments and had a unit 731 in every human city) BAD.
I want also to point out only FIVE years have been passed since X-Com 2 events. You remember how American people were so tolerant and friendly with Japanese after WW2? Or the polish with the Germans? Or the Chinese with the Japanese? Everybody knows we humans are a wonderful and tolerant race.
The product has the moral high ground to judge ANYONE who is against the established order RACIST BAD. There is no compromise, they are RACIST so you have to kill them on sight.
The bad guys are so comically evil, kids Sunday morning cartoons evil. They have no layers, they are bad, they do bad things you MUST hate them. You want more info? No, they are evil, they do bad things.
This is also a detriment for the gameplay. In SWAT games, literally and the genre, you are usually punished to shoot without warning or for cheap violence. You are there to arrest and defuse potential harm to civilians. That’s not the case, fuck them racist, kill ‘em all. 
In X-Com you have to kill on sight because there is a WAR on the background. Here you are in peace times. This product literally endorse police violence and brutality just because “they are racists man, they deserve it”. Oh but they are really smart pointing out “you are not the police”. You are acting like police, you are addressed as a police force, you are arresting and killing people in critical felony or criminal situations but nono, you are not the police.
Yes I know the aliens in X-Com are basically other alien races enslaved against their will. I know. But the product shouts in my hear 24\7 JUST ACCEPT IT. People MUST ACCEPT aliens in position of power, all over the media, basically having more power than humans. People MUST BE FRIENDLY WITH THEM OR BE KILLED OR ARRESTED. You really want me to believe in a democratic election an ALIEN won the major race. We have ALIEN social media “influencers”, cops are aliens, aliens in position of power. After all that happened? And everyone against this is “bad” by definition.
This is not even suspension of disbelief, this is insane agenda pushing. And we are not even talking about a world war, economic, political crisis. We are talking about the total enslavement of humanity, people eaten as FOOD and cruel abhorrent genetic experimentation. But yes, humans tend to forgive we are all happy under the rainbow.
This product had so much potential but they had to destroy it just to get woke\agenda\sjw\whatever pick your demon points creating the most absurd and incoherent worldbuilding over a 10+ games established franchise.
I played almost the two hours legal term for a refund, I looked on the internet for every info of the product I needed and I asked a refund for a product I paid 1 (one) euro because I don’t even want to see it in my list. Because those devs and this kind of product don’t deserve even ONE euro.
This is how mad I am with this awful product that probably is the last X-Com we will ever have."

Cons:  An alternate Map, Icons, and Color Scheme need to be created that make it easier to tell the countries apart.

In an online multiplayer game,  I can see how the current system works, but when I play a solo game, I should be able to choose them.

[b] Stronghold: Warlords[/b] is a disappointing miss and a step backwards for the series. How can a game released in 2021 look and play worse than Stronghold 2 from 2005? While the East Asian setting has a lot of potential, the dated graphics and clumsy gameplay ruin too much of the experience. 
 | Many bugs and issues:
1. Resolution, if I put a full screen, game won't start, I must do Windowed mode.....!!!
2. Cursor in game isn't properly centered. To aim at lets say, go back button in game, I need to aim cursor 4 cm towards right and also 4 cm down, to hit that button.... I don't know who created this game. Not good. | I've played every Stronghold game in existence, so I feel qualified to leave my opinion on this one. Stronghold: Warlords is a very fun and good game that receives unfair criticism. In my opinion Warlords is the best Stronghold release after Stronghold Crusader. In terms of game play, AI characters, having a skirmish mode, etc.. this game is great. The only thing I don't enjoy about this game is the warlords system, but in skirmish mode you can just disable that anyway. 

When it comes to 3D stronghold games, this is the best in the franchise by far. This game is a massive step in the right direction for 3D stronghold games, and makes me optimistic and excited for the next 3D stronghold that releases. Build off of this firefly and your next 3D stronghold game will be a huge winner.

If you're a fan of Stronghold games and on the fence about Warlords, give it a try. I think you will find that you enjoy it and there's a lot of replayability and value here. | Most of the negative comments about the game hold some truth, particularly regarding image quality. However, despite these critiques, this is an excellent Stronghold game and feels genuinely refreshing. The addition of new troops is a great enhancement, and the Warlord system adds an engaging layer of strategy. If you're a fan of the Stronghold series, especially Stronghold: Crusader, there's a good chance you'll enjoy this game as well.

[i][b]Among Us[/b] — это многопользовательская онлайн-игра. Игра быстро завоевала популярность благодаря своей увлекательной механике и возможности взаимодействия с другими игроками.[/i]

[b]Сюжет и атмосфера:[/b]
[i]Сюжет игры Among Us начинается с возвращения межзвездного космического корабля домой после опасного путешествия. Часть команды заражена инопланетными мозговыми паразитами, которые превращают их в саботажников с жаждой убийства.

Мирные космонавты должны выполнять задания для восстановления работоспособности корабля и выявлять предателей, чтобы избавиться от них. Саботажники же стремятся убить мирных игроков и саботировать системы корабля, оставаясь при этом незамеченными.

Игра сочетает элементы психологического триллера, где напряжение и подозрения постоянно нарастают, а ключевые обсуждения и разоблачения происходят на общих собраниях команды.[/i]

[b]Геймплей:[/b]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yapmayın oğlum söylemeyin şöyle şeyler..

Genel anlamda internet ortamında açıkça ve rahatlıkla eleştiri yapacak bir düzeye gelmişken ayrıca bir çok şeye tek bir tıkla ulaşıp araştırma imkanınız varken kendi fikirlerinizi oluşturmayıp neden başkalarından duyduğunuz şeyleri savunuyor ve insanlara yanlış algılar hediye ediyorsunuz ?

Yapmayın..

""Gerekli laf söyleme kısmını geçtiğimi göre şimdi oyundan bahsedebiliriz""

Her şeyin başlangıcı olarak verilmese de karakteri tanımamız ve hikayeyi anlayabilmemiz için gerekli oyun olarak karşımıza çıkıyor Witcher 1.

Çok güzel bir senaryo hazırlanmış öncesi hakkında bir fikrimiz yok sonrası ise tamamen muamma ilerledikçe kendimize ve hikayeye dair ip uçları ediniyor ve bir şekilde kafamızda yaşananları şekillendirmeye başlıyoruz.

[spoiler]Oyunun en başında karşımıza çıkan çocuğun en sonunda karşımıza çıkacağını kim bilebilir ki ?[/spoiler]

Oyun sırasında çok fazla npc ile diyalog kurabiliyor ana karakterimiz adına seçim yapmamız gereken çok fazla sahne ile karşılaşıyoruz.

Yetenek ağacı ise gerçekten harika oynamak istediğiniz stile yatırım yaptıkça harika kombolar ve hızlandırmalar sunuyor.

Dövüş sistemi sanıldığının aksine birazcık refleks birazcık dikkatli oynamak mantığında ilerliyor yeterli upgrade'leri alırsanız karşınızdaki 10 kişiyi havada 5 takla atarak inanılmaz artist şekillerde kesebiliyorsunuz.

Görev mantığı ise harika tüm oyunlarında olduğu gibi hangisinin side hangisinin main quest olduğunu size veriyor ve en önemli kısmı o görevleri yapabilmek için sadece bulunduğunuz haritada değil başka haritalara gidip gelebiliyorsunuz.

""Emek veriyorsunuz""

Bu oyun için gerçekten emek veriyorsunuz eski olmasına rağmen tek bir anında bile beni sıkmayan başından saatlerce kalkmadığım bir oyun oldu Witcher benim için.

Her anında insanları tek tek tanımak hikayelerini dinlemek yeri geldiğinde sarhoş olup ağzınlarından laf almak yeri geldiğinde genel evdeki kızlara çiçek götürmek her anı ile gerçekten harika bir oyun Witcher 1.

Yaptığım seçimler sırasında gerçekten zorlandığım noktalar oldu ben olsam ne yapardım Gerald aslında ne yapar kısımlarında bazı seçim ekranlarında oturup düşünmüşlüğüm var ve her şeyin sonunda tamamen benim verdiğim kararlara göre şekillenmiş bir son çıktı karşıma.,

Oyun beni tatmin etti mi ? Fazlasıyla..
Oyundan keyif aldım mı ? İnanılmaz derece..
Peki oyunun grafikleri çok mu kötü ? Hayır kesinlikle değil
Peki oyunun combat sistemi çok mu saçma ya da çok mu zor ? Hayır aslında inanılmaz basit
Peki gerçekten hikayeyi anlamak için ilk oyunu oynamamız mı gerekiyor ? ""EVET""

Neden bu kadar agresif cevaplar veriyorum ? şu yüzden..

Oyuna başladığım günün sabahında Discord da masum masum oyunu oynuyorken discordda ki arkadaşlarımızdan birisi yanıma geldi ve sırf Enis K. isimli youtuber'ın videosunu izlediği için abi o oyuna rework şart yaa gibisinden bir cümle kullandı..
Mikrofondan yumruk atabilmeyi gerçekten çok isterdim..

İlk oyunu oynamana gerek yok diğer oyunlarda hikayeyi anlayabiliyorsun diyen arkadaşlarım dostlarım..
İlk oyunda öldürüp öldürmemenin kararı sana bırakılmış karakterler diğer oyunda sırf senin yaptığın seçime göre karşına çıkabiliyorken..
3. Oyunda dahi diyaloğa gireceğimiz karakterlerin başlangıç hikayelerini ilk oyunda öğrenirken..
Firma oyunun hikayesinin temelini ilk oyunda yaptığını açıklamışken ne demek lan ilk oyunu oynama diğer oyunlarda anlaşılıyor ??

Düşünsene Matrix'i öneriyorsun arkadaşına ve diyorsun ki ilk film'i izleme adam işte Matrix oluyor..
Lan oluyor da o sırada yaşadıkları ne oluyor ? o etrafındaki insanlar nereden geliyor ? o herif Matrix olana kadar neler çekiyor ?

Oyun indirim döneminde ciklet parasına kadar düşüyorken lütfen alıp kendiniz tecrübe edin..
Yine beğenmezseniz ben hep buradayım. Oturur konuşur tartışırız.


Dikkat: "" Bu incelemeyi okurken yorum ekranında bol bol devrik cümle, erken bitirilmiş diyaloglar ve açıklamalarda yumuşatılma hissedebilirsiniz. İnsanlara atar yapmamam gerektiğini kendime söyleyerek yazmış birisi olarak bu açıklamayıp da yapma gereksinimi duydum "" 

Teşekkürler.


 | Este jogo é incrível, mas não é para todos, ele possui uma complexidade tática única, o que vai faz muita gente achar ele difícil quando na verdade se você usar a estratégia certa ele fica relativamente fácil.

[b]Jogue este o jogo se você:[/b]
[list]
[*] Gosta de Leitura.
[*] Gosta de RPG.
[*] Gosta de explorar.
[*] Gosta de Jogos com características táticas complexas.
[*] Gosta de jogos clássicos como os primeiros Dark Souls e Neverwinter Nights.
[*] Tem disposição para coletar e craftar itens.
[/list]

[b]Evite este jogo se:[/b]
[list]
[*] Não gosta de Leitura, (Há muita coisa para ler no jogo)
[*] Não gosta de RPG ou escolhas complexas.
[*] Não gosta de ficar perdendo tempo falando com todos npcs e entrando em todos os lugares.
[*] Gosta apenas de lutar metendo a espada nos inimigos sem frescuras como magia e alquimia.
[*] Não gosta de jogos datados ou com jogabilidade estranha.
[*] Não quer perder tempo coletando e craftando itens.
[/list]

[b]Alquimia[/b]

O uso de poções não é opcional, é OBRIGATÓRIO. Neste jogo você precisa coletar itens como plantas e partes de animais, comprar e ler formulas para poções e óleos, crafta-los e usar de acordo com o contexto, inimigo e sua estratégia. Essas informações custam caro no jogo, tanto em tempo conversando com npcs quanto em ouro para comprar as formulas. 

[b]Inimigos e Combates[/b]

A parte mais divertida para mim e mais odiada para outros. No jogo você possui uma espada de prata e uma de aço, além de 3 estilos de combate, você precisa usar a arma certa no estilo de combate certo contra o inimigo certo, e juntamente com isso combinar a magia e alquimia para explorar as fraquezas dos adversários, isso é fundamental especialmente nos chefes. 

Os pontos fracos dos monstros e chefes do jogo também não são de graça, você precisa comprar livros, e falar com npcs para descobri-los, o que você pode facilmente perder durante a progressão do game ou simplesmente ficar sem dinheiro para adquirir as informações, deixando o game mais difícil e menos rico em termos de lore. De posse da informação você precisa ficar consultado o codex do jogo para elaborar as estratégias de combate. 

As coisas não explicitas no codex, por exemplo, ele diz que o chefe do primeiro capitulo é pouco vulnerável a magia Aard, se você se deu o trabalho de aprender ou usar a magia Aard em combate sabe que ela tonteia os inimigos possibilitando que você os mate com um só golpe. 

De posse dessas duas informações você pode elaborar a estratégia de fortalecer o Aard para matar o chefe ""super difícil"" do capitulo 1 com apenas um golpe.  Mas cabe ao jogador chegar nesta conclusão e planejar com antecedência. Parece algo simples mas a maioria dos jogadores não o fazem pois jogam irrefletidamente. [b]The Witcher não vai te pegar pela mão. cabe a você pegar os insumos que o jogo te oferece para ter uma boa experiência[/b].

[b]História[/b]

A lore da série witcher dispensa comentários, só não posso deixar de mencionar que em diversos momentos o jogo tem coloca entre escolhas morais de fritar a cabeça. Você sempre se pega tentando entender qual a coisa certa até se dar conta que no jogo não existe isto de coisa certa, e que ninguém é inocente.

Uma coisa importante é que a história avança de forma inesperada, é normal coisas ficarem para trás na primeira jogada, sempre tenha isso em mente ao entrar em um lugar ou completar uma quest, as vezes o jogo avança e algumas quests não podem ser completadas, outras o jogador acaba deixando passar. Desta forma o jogo tem um valor alta para quem for re-jogar. | Après avoir fini le jeu en 63h, je ne peux que le recommander.

Certes, il n'est plus au goût du jour, mais n'oublions pas qu'il date de 2008 : 

-  la fluidité des mouvements n'est pas celle d'un jeu de 2019 
-  la réactivité peut parfois être légèrement ennuyante (dégainer 3 plombes après le début du combat) 

Et pour ceux/celles qui n'aiment pas faire des allers-retours pour une quête, qui n'aiment pas prendre le temps de dialoguer pour récolter un maximum d'informations, passer votre chemin ! Par ailleurs, c'est un RPG ... il faut bien s'y attendre.  

Cependant, il reste immersif et on se laisse prendre au jeu ... et puis ... toute trilogie ne commence-t-elle pas par le 1e épisode si l'on veut en comprendre l'histoire complète ?   

N'hésitez plus ...

Sans compter que 1,19€ pour 63h de jeu (soit 0.018€ / h) ...

Казалось бы, контента на сотни часов, чего тебе еще надо?

Гейм-дизайна, мне очень надо гейм-дизайна и немного UI.

Играл на максимальной сложности, за 30+ часов дошел до второго акта. Бесконечные битвы начинают утомлять, а тут как на зло квест: проведи еще 8 боев с элитными врагами. Спустись в данж, а там за каждый ключ снова эти рутинные бои, и снова, и снова. Там уже нет никакой сложности, но врагов много, десятки. Каждый ход на каждого нужно навестись, чтобы посмотреть кого они там бьют, с линии на линию всех переместить, это все затягивается, а потом снова такой же бой, и снова, и снова. 
Уже собрана и прогрейжена кор дека, ты редко берешь новые карты или не делаешь этого вовсе, а подавляющие кол-во вещей- мусор.

Из-за неудобного интерфейса, возня с картами, рунами, перековкой, расходниками, артефактами, древом прокачки затягивается буквально на часы. Это просто пытка. Этого всего слишком много, ты в этом просто тонешь.

Казалось бы, 10 героев должны внести разнообразие, но ты не будешь их менять ведь под них уже нароллены карты и собраны артефакты.

И вроде хочется играть, но, когда ты в самой игре, в очередном бою тягомотишь это и в награду очередной раз получаешь хлам и 20 золотых, а потом смотришь сколько тебе их еще надо до финала и просто опускаются руки. | 游戏缝的还凑合，也有自己的特点，但能感受出在开发过程中，早期的一些设定和最终的成品完全不匹配。比如回血和回疲劳第二章开始做到了一起；中期以后的扎营完全变成负面作用，导致补给完全没用处。等等…
游戏还有一个致命的缺点，打到后期完全没有爽点。如果全体爆输出，不管对手啥怪，都是开局一轮秒；如果战法牧打法，每一轮打怪都要一个个看每个怪的攻击目标，时间拖得久太折磨了…；自由度过于高，那么多职业那么多卡牌，研究联动也非常非常拖节奏。
但是至少前10个小时还是玩的非常有意思的，折扣价入手不亏。 | 游戏很不错，自由度高，适合休闲玩家，看我游戏时间。
而且我看见开发者团队有在认真回复每一个玩家的评论，我觉得这样的游戏怎么都不会太差。 | 優秀的卡牌+RPG養成遊戲
獨特裝備提升強 但獲取和強化的隨機性太高 成本高但刷了半天不一定有自己想要的
 | Easy to play, difficult to master.

Absolutely worth spending a some time on this little gem, particularly in earlier levels before you settle on your preferred team offers plenty of variety and interest. After a while it can become a little goldfishy after the main campaign but there is a certain appeal in that. You can min-max to your heart's content and enjoy making the perfect team."
76561197974286855,1001980,Archeo: Shinar,2.933333333333333,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",3,"It has the Achilles' heel of strategy games: A tutorial that tells you to do many things, but no explanation of why you'd want do it. It doesn't realise that it could be much more with less.

The mechanics do not mesh and aren't in service to each other and seemingly exist only to add unneeded complexity. I have a massive board game collection and this felt like coming into a complex 4x game with two expansions already integrated and half the rulebook missing.

I had to quit out of the basic tutorial and restart it twice thinking I'd missed something before getting frustrated and just quitting altogether. If your solution to negative reviews is to post an explainer video, then that should indicate to you that your tutorial is simply not good enough. Speaking of... After I came back and tried again, I got stuck in the fourth tutorial and had to force quit the game and try again before it finally let me through.

After beating all the tutorials I think I actually understood less than when I went in and have zero inclination to actually play the game. It was as if it were trying to teach me 5 disparate games that were tied together by nothing more than a loose theme. | I am really torn on this game. I love the art, the theme and I do enjoy playing it, but the difficulty level is just impossibly high. I play it on easy and still I struggle to get very far before losing.

This game has some RNG elements around what missions are available and sometimes you just get screwed over by that. Also once you start to do badly it is nearly impossible to make a come back, as you fail after failing to pay your workers 3 times, but if you fail to pay them one month the next time you must pay them what they are owed on top of their wages, so unless you get really lucky having 2 month's wages at that point is very unlikely.

I am optimistic that the devs are listening to feedback though, they've unlocked the tutorials so you no longer need to earn access to them. I'm hoping that by continuing to bang my head against the wall of this game's difficulty I am eventually going to be able to get further (or that someone will make a whole wiki for this game that can hold my hand through it!

In summary, I would recommend this game to people who are very good gamers or like a hard challenge, but for the majority of people I think they'll be put off by the cliff face of a difficulty curve. | Archeo: Shinar is an economic turn-based strategy game. It focuses on the preparation and shady operations between expeditions like in a grotesque (or not!) Picture of so-called academia. You will explore those dusty tombs like in any other game about archeology but this time, not with your own hands. In this game, you are the guy who ""manage"" expeditions, write publications (or rather sell them to newspapers) and keep on track with the new events like hating this guy for finding ""wrong"" artifacts because our paradigms say it shouldn't be there. 
For now, it's early access, and you can see minor bugs and lack of career mode, but the custom mode allows you to play up to 4 people and has enough content for more than 10 hrs of fun. 
If you are looking for a game focused on archeology, expeditions and finding lost legacy then... you should watch some gameplays because this game is focused on the economic aspect and without the story mode (career) you may find it a little bit odd to sit in a comfy chair in your office only to respond to letters and hire new explorers. However, it's refreshing to take a look from a new angle on the archeology topic. | I just finished the tutorial and the game seems interesting, with lots of different strategic elements to have to balance.  However, I understood less and less of what the tutorial was trying to teach me as the game went on because the English got worse and worse.  They need to hire a copy-editor/translator to fix it.  Not a great first impression.  However, the game does seem to have great potential.  I'll come back and edit this review if my impression changes as my gameplay continues.

Edit: It crashed the second time I opened it.  Welp. | A far too abstract push-your-luck game with an awfully bad tutorial and introduction. For this to have been released years after Renowned Explorers is just mad. I can't think of anyone to recommend this game to, who wouldn't be having a better time with a narratively richer game like Renowned Explorers or a snappier push-your-luck styled game like Skull or Dead of Winter."

After such a mixed experience im amazed they released not 1 but 4 dlcs, which i have not tried but i assume only makes the imbalancing worst. | This game isn't just another deck builder, its thoroughly tactical and enjoyable. Bear with the info dump of a tutorial though. Once you have started playing it you will get it really fast :) | Visually, Banners of Ruin is stunning, but it just doesn’t offer enough substance to back up its good looks. I really wanted a roguelite deck-builder with meaningful troop placement and movement, but the game barely lets you take advantage of those mechanics. The ruin system, for instance, feels half-baked, and there are so many underwhelming cards that just end up bloating your deck. Recruiting new party members just makes the bloat worse, so a lot of the systems feel like they exist solely to slow you down.

I haven’t tried any of the DLC, but I suspect its required to make the game fun. After a few hours felt like I’d already seen most of what the base game has to offer. Compared to other deckbuilders, Banners of Ruin feels limited and stiff, with slower progression that leans more heavily into grind than strategy. It left me wishing for a deeper system where synergies actually come together in a satisfying way, rather than a handful of random events and mechanics that never quite gel.

Its not completely unplayable, but I'm adding it to the ""unplayable"" steam game category I made so I don't have to look at it, and don't accidentally reinstall it, play it again, and experience the irritable mood it puts me in. | [Note: as of this writing Steam says my play time is 13 minutes probably because I have overwhelmingly been playing this off line.  My actual play time is approaching 40 hours, so this review is not as superficial as the incorrectly listed 13 minutes would imply.  In evidence of my actual play time, I have unlocked 87% of the achievements which I doubt is possible in only 13 minutes of total play.]

On initial playthrough I initially mistook Banners of Ruin as basically as DLC reskin for Slay the Spire being passed off as a different game.  This initial misconception was based on the fact that beyond merely being a deck-building card strategy there are a large number of similarities between the two, most notably the starter-deck for non-DLC-hero-characters in Banners of Ruin superficially looks all but identical to the one from Slay the Spire.  One unlocks cards and talents on repeated playthroughs through experience points just like Slay the Spire.  Even on further playthoughs the “fake ending” with the “fake final boss” being replaced by the option to push further to a proper ending with a real final boss if additional work was done and sacrifices were made, felt almost verbatim from Slay the Spire.  Numerous other smaller things like the racial ability of the weasels to produce three disposable poisoned throwing-blades will also feel a little too familiar.

This initial take, however, proved to be very shallow as while there are many similarities between these two titles there are also a lot of differences to the point where Banners of Ruin is not just effectively a “DLC reskin” of Slay the Spire but is own beast entirely.   Among the many differences between the two titles, the most significant in their differentiation I found to be the approaches in strategy required by Banners of Ruin resulting from the mechanics of positioning with ranks and lanes, as well as the whole aspect of the party / team instead of a single player controlled character as per Slay the Spire.  The interplay of not merely the cards with the cards, or the cards with the races/characters using them – both of which are experienced in Slay the Spire – is made considerably more rich and complicated in Banners of Ruin by interacting the aforementioned pairing combinations between different party members (up to six at a time) in different positions on the board (both absolute and sometimes relative to one another), and also against the positioning of the opponents on their board.  While there were many moments later in Slay the Spire where I had to really stop and think about the best use of my resources across the numerous possibilities presented to me each turn, the possibilities of action in Banners of Ruin in the later game just become shockingly more diverse, rich, and complicated beyond what ever occurs in Slay the Spire.  Most of the time I enjoyed that richness of possibility, but in some difficult and complicated battles I occasionally felt a bit overwhelmed by the massive combinatorics of competing cost-benefit analyses I had to try and weigh against each other to make even a single move.

There seem to be a few subtle bugs, or rather missed mechanic-combinations here and there in Banners of Ruin (at least as of this writing.)  I assume this is a result of the massive amount of potential complexity of operational options possible making play-testing all possible strange and nuanced combinations a little hard.  For example, there is a particular “Sacrifice” card (I forget its exact name among the few that contain the word “sacrifice”) – a card that is clearly about making a blood sacrifice to aid an ally – whose cost can actually be dodged.  I could be wrong, but I am pretty sure it was not intended to allow one to give a ridiculous benefit to an ally at no cost to one’s other character by allowing them to dodge their own self-blood-sacrifice but have it count as properly paid anyway.  Similarly there are a number of cards that specify characters be equipped for either 2-handed weapons or dual wielding, and some of these cards accept both when they don’t specify that (and don’t seem like they should.)  Further on that topic, some of the cards giving bonuses specifically to dual wielding actually also give their bonus to a normal load out consisting of weapon + shield when that looks wrong based on the nature of the card – I believe it was the card “Akimbo” seems to accidentally work in this way.

Banners of Ruin is definitely an enjoyable game and its own thing despite the superficial appearance of high-similarity in mechanics and structure to Slay the Spire, but for reasons I can’t fully understand or articulate I never found Banners of Ruin quite as thrilling or addictive as Slay the Spire.  Slay the Spire is a very high bar IMHO and so that is not a strike against Banners of Ruin that it does quite make it there in my book as it is fairly close.  In Banners of Ruin’s favor, I like the parties, equipment, art, world, and atmosphere a little more than Slay the Spire, but that is a subtle matter of personal taste that many might disagree with. | amo o jogo, mas podia ser maior

Where ZAT was just [i]Sniper Elite with zombies[/i], ZA4 is a completely different beast that honestly doesn't feel anything like ZAT. They've added so much, from unique and cool weapon attachments to (a lot of) new zombie types, new moves like stomping, a melee attack, new grenades, perks & so much more. It all fits really well and every part of it feels natural to have and use. Progression is engaging and it will keep you busy with new unlocks and gameplay mechanics for quite a while. I am shocked at how much they added when coming from ZAT and even more shocked at how well it all fits together. The only thing I don't really like are some of the tedious weapon challenges. This is really fun when playing with friends.

Where my excitement ends is when looking at the DLC. 3 season passes, no matter how good the game, is egregious. Rebellion realized it themselves after making the first season pass free, but that won't create any goodwill for me. The DLC is heavily overpriced (something Rebellion seems to enjoy doing more and more ever since ZA4 & SE5), and doesn't really bring all that much new to the game. New guns and missions are fine, but the vast majority of the season passes are cluttered with useless charms and cosmetic items to make it seem like they have more content.

My advise? Get the game on sale or from a third party, grab season pass 1, and either skip out on the DLC or try to get them on key resellers for significantly cheaper. Even during Steam sales the DLC costs too much.

You can feel the soul and charm that this game has ([i]cough cough[/i] something that seems to be missing ever since SE5). It's clear that the devs put all their creativity into this. Just a shame the DLC suffers so much from corporate greed. | Muito divertido no coop, jogo simples e prático bom p fazer amigos.

76561197974286855,1102190,Monster Train,33.43333333333333,Strategy,17,"Monster Train is a deck-building game. It's following in the footsteps of other great games like Slay the Spire. As a result, I will be comparing this game to Slay the Spire a lot.

In Monster Train, you defend a train full of (you guessed it) monsters. You fight a series of battles, with each battle involving a bunch of minor enemies followed by a major (boss) enemy. In-between battles you do some deck construction using various stations. One run takes about 60 to 90 minutes.

I've gotten 85 hours of fun out of this game.

THE GOOD:
- Monster Train is a really fun card battler.
- The train level mechanic, where you have 4 different levels in your train, adds a lot of strategic depth and novelty.
- You can always refuse a new card or artifact, something I always wished I could do in Slay the Spire—which would force me to take cards I didn't want and then make it really hard to get rid of them.
- It's also easier to remove cards you don't want, often allowing you to craft the deck you want by the endgame.
- The game lets you know who the major bosses are at the very start of the run. This allows you to build your deck accordingly.
- Great variety of enemies, cards, and special abilities.
- Great learning curve, as new concepts are gradually introduced so you don't have to drink from a firehose of knowledge.
- Nice graphics and music.

THE BAD:
- There is no real story to the game. There's kind of the veneer of a story, but it doesn't really explain why you need to do multiple runs.
- Even with the better control over your deck than other games in the genre, you are still at the mercy of the random number generator. It can be frustrating to lose because you never found the cards you needed, or because of a terrible draw for an otherwise great deck.
- The game developers claim this game is a roguelike, but it's not really. You play to unlock new features, which is a good tutorial mechanic, but to be a roguelike the game should require you to learn by failing. I won on my second attempt.

THE UGLY:
- In this game the protagonists are the demons of Hell, and you actually fight against Heavenly angels. This doesn't bother me, but you might find it offensive.
- When using a mouse and dragging a card to play it, if you linger the game can automatically scroll up to a level above. This is a great way to ruin your battle by playing the card on the wrong level!
- The game enables you to ramp up the difficulty with a feature called the Covenant. This is ostensibly a good thing that gives the game some extra life and challenge. Unfortunately, in trying to find a variety of ways to increase the difficulty the game designer has mainly made the game more annoying. They add lots of junk cards to your deck and make it harder to remove those cards. Hence, rather than ending with a bang, the game kind of fizzled out with a whimper as I got increasingly frustrated and quit.
 | I'll be honest. I didn't like it that much. Primarily because the game at higher difficults devolves into gigagbuffing one monster to solo the final boss. Still though learning the game was great. | I played this roguelite cards battler on various platforms, gamepass pc ,xbox and steam, and its a great game. Fun. 
For me the progression of the game is really good, while you play more you unlock fun other stuff. The combinations are a blast, you can make over the top OP cards. I like the sounds when the train is totaly full and your cards all packed with buffs, the sound is not beautiful, but catching, and I like the raw sound of the abilities clashing into each other.
Its cool and easy to play some rounds, make comobs and have fun.
Game is fun and well made, for sure worth your time

 | I stand by my early impressions that the UI clashes terribly in this game. For context, I've played and love Slay the Spire, and I THOUGHT I'd like Monster Train, but I thought it was kind of ugly...I admit I wasn't in the mood to give it a fair shake, and it is now starting to click with me. It's good, but not great, with tremendous replay value. | High Quality Time Deleting Machine. I have hundreds of hours on mobile as well. Base game is good but I recommend getting Wurmkin DLC as well. Unfortunately, not nearly enough Steam Community additions and sorely needs additional characters, cards, and artifacts."

Начнём с того, что может не понравится некоторым игрокам:
1. Игра точно мотивирует пройти её несколько раз, при том, что она является сюжетной. Мотивирует ачивками, открытием новых министров, бонусами на следующие прохождения, невозможностью увидеть всё за один раз. Могут ли там быть разные концовки? Да, немного разные концовки могут быть, в зависимости от некоторых решений в процессе президентства, но вариантов их там не много. Игра в любом случае, закончится после двух президентских сроков [spoiler](если быть совсем точным, второй раз выиграть выборы придётся для достижения хотя бы относительно позитивного итога, но третий срок отсиживать уже не придётся из-за определённого ключевого события, которое случится буквально через несколько месяцев после второй победы на выборах)[/spoiler], поэтому сравнивать её с политическими бесконечными песочницами совершенно нельзя. С другой стороны, у меня не было ощущения, что я хочу продолжить дальше, то есть мне было интересно ровно до того момента, когда как раз концовка и наступает - именно в этот момент понимаешь, что хочешь закончить. Так что какой-никакой приятный баланс тут соблюдён, просто не факт, что всем игрокам захочется играть многократно.
2. Игра не представляет собой слишком глубокую симуляцию политических процессов, то есть не стоит ждать от неё чего-то масштабов «Tropico». Но в то же время она не представляет собой и быстро надоедающий симулятор иконок, связей и табличек, вроде «Democracy», где подвигал всё везде в нужную тебе сторону и радуйся - смысла в ней сидеть дольше часа больше нет. Игра и тут успешно балансирует где-то между... поэтому может не зайти любителям либо одного, либо другого. Она не пытается быть серьёзной, но она может быть такой. Она не пытается быть хардкорной, но называть её казуальной - язык не поворачивается.

Теперь то, что точно может быть приятно в этом политическом симуляторе:
1. В нём требуется балансировать между разными регионами страны, где могут быть сильно разные люди с разными потребностями. Учитывая то, что игра каждое новое прохождение генерирует карту (да, карта там не статичная - она при каждой новой игре будет немного разной, её генерацию можно настраивать: другие ресурсы, другие ключевые точки, другое физическое состояние страны, другие опасные места, другие соседи и тому подобное), то регионы тоже могут поменяться. Смотришь налево - там огромный сельхозрегион с лугами и сёлами, где верят в странную местную религию; смотришь в центр - там небольшой урбанизированный регион с огромными городами, где преобладает уже образованное либеральное городское население; смотришь направо - там вообще горный регион, где население преимущественно составляет этническое меньшинство, которое вообще не против отделиться от страны, вот только там у них выход к морю и главный порт в стране... И, при каждой генерации, подобные региональные вызовы меняются. И, если уж не всех этих разных людей с разными желаниями, то хотя бы большинство, надо удовлетворить к выборам, иначе не победить.
2. Механики и геймплей достаточно масштабны, чтобы их можно было похвалить: тут таблицы и графики, ползунки бюджетов и прочие элементы, которые любят хардкорщики; тут и строительство ключевых зданий и нужных местах, прокладка дорог и транспортная логистика, любимые градостроителями; тут и постоянные политические дилеммы, которые надо разрешать, так любимые казуальщиками. Кажется, игра пыталась сесть сразу на все стулья. И, кажется, у неё даже получилось, потому что ничего из этого нет так много, чтобы задушить. Оно всё как-то органично сменяет друг друга на экране игрока.
3. Игра изобилует разными необычными фишками: видеовставки, некоторый юмор, невероятные случайные события... всё это дополнительного разноображивает геймплей и механики, которые и без того, достаточно широки. Настолько широки, что в некоторых вещах стоит даже поискать гайды или спрашивать у игравшего друга, что делать.

Итог: я однозначно могу сказать, что игра мне понравилась и видно, как разработчики старались наполнить её контентом. И, пусть она не получилась масштабов глобальных стратегий от «Paradox», где игроки запускают сотни разных каток и сидят в них тысячи часов, игра правда может иногда напомнить о себе и заставить пройти новую катку. Было бы даже интересно посмотреть, что бы получилось у разработчиков, если бы у них были бюджеты и сроки на создание глобальной стратегии. Я бы с удовольствием такое увидел. На фоне позитивных эмоций от игры тонут некоторые ошибки локализации, не очень удобное управление войсками и редкие вылеты, но не сказать про это, не могу (пусть те, кто сочтёт нужным прочесть этот обзор, будут в курсе их наличия). Но эта игра заслужила, чтобы я проигнорировал огрехи и играл несколько раз, потому что она хотела быть не такой, как все. Я не знаю, придутся ли кому-то всё эти креативы по душе ещё, но игра точно достойна ознакомления с ней и покупки (тем более на неё бывают огромные скидки по 80%). | Overly complicated slide juggler and builder that feels more like whack-a-mole than a 4x strategy. | Best.

Fun but the requirements to enjoy the game as it's worth is too high.

- the main selling point is its a party coop game, beside that the game offers low replayability with around 1:20 hours minimum per session, which is really long
- online matchmaking is dead, meaning we need exactly a party of 3 for a balanced gameplay
- even when on sale, the price is too high when there are so many better singleplayer alternatives | Awesome fun! You really have to think about your moves. The art style is great! The devs have done a great job with this game. | Superb co-op card battler

Having seasonal mechanics tacked on seems like the easy approach but doesn't add much to the overall game. They really should take the Dead Cells model with the stage scheming and add more branching zones and tilesets to make things feel fresh. Add more variety to the rooms per stage, like with the recent anxi desert change. Stick to one overarching mechanic that players can keep grinding on instead of adding seasonal ones that shift character useability and run approach every 4 months.

Subsequent updates also seem to be introducing some lag to the game. Tabbing out, even in singleplayer makes the game hang for a split second. Entering one room in multiplayer after someone else causes the game to hang at times. If the devs really do want to stick to the seasonal plan, then expand the skins to include the characters as well and make them limited to events! Soul essence is already a persistent currency that players can acquire with a grind. | I've sunk a few hundred hours into this game; once you grasp the connections between guns, abilities, and scrolls, it becomes  seriously addicting. I've played every season variation, and the way star link expands upon your character build is the most fun yet. I can easily justify $20 due to the amount of content it offers. | I didn't give this game much thought until I started playing it. The game is a well-made rogue-lite that's fun to play. The experience is even better with friends, up to three people, or you can find online matches.
I've highlighted 3 points that I think are important to mention:

Seasons
The season system is well-made. I've only played the last 2 seasons. At first, it's hard to understand the mechanics, but you get the hang of it over time. You just have to pay close attention to the readings, but they're very fun and varied. The season pass is free, easy and quick to get, and gives you beautiful and well-made cosmetics, which is a very positive point.

Replayability
I particularly enjoyed replaying the game. Putting on a playlist to listen to while playing is a pleasant experience. The game has many achievements and some of them require time and effort to complete, a huge variety of weapons to unlock, which gives a great feeling when you get a new weapon, in days when in any game you have to keep paying to get new things in the game (the game has 3 DLC with weapons, but the game also adds free weapons in each season).

Game modes
The game has few modes, only three, being the conventional mode, the main game mode where you have the stages and their difficulty to choose and challenge yourself and it is in this mode that you unlock most of the weapons and achievements in the game. The daily challenge mode, nothing special, the name already says what it is, a mode with a modifier that changes daily, just to get some achievements and challenge yourself. And the last mode, the horde mode, is a mode where you can equip some improvements to your characters and fight against large hordes of enemies that get harder and harder over time, but it has a final boss, so the hordes end. It's fun, but it only has two maps so far, and it ends up being repetitive.

My final thoughts are that the game is worth it for those who like games of this style, it's very different and diverse from the others. For the base game I think the price is worth it, but for the DLC I think it's worth waiting for a sale.

Enjoy and feedback! :) | Eu queria muito dar uma tryhardada em Gunfire Reborn, mas estava meio complicado de jogar sozinho. Então, surgiu uma promoção de conteudo adicional do game e resolvi comprar uma das 3 DLC's do jogo.
E rapaziada... de longe foi a melhor coisa que eu ja fiz!!! ^^ 

Gunfire Reborn é um game Roguelike/Roguelite, FPS, com leves elementos de RPG. Existem 12 personagens jogavéis que são bicinhos bem fofinhos (não sei se chega a ser furry), em que todos possuem 2 habilidades unicas e especiais, dando uma pegada de que cada run seja realmente diferenciada e unica. 6 são free, onde você desbloqueia apenas jogando, e os outros 6 são de dlc's. 

O jogo possui bastante coisa legal, como uma variedade boa de armas, inimigos, pergaminhos para buildar e uma arvore de talentos bacana até.
Durante a play, você vai se deparar com 3 steps até o final. É como se fosse o começo, meio e fim, bem padrão!! E em cada stage diferente, existe a possibilidade de vir 2 tipos de chefes. É sempre sortido, nunca da pra saber ao certo quem vai vir. 

Agora, como eu disse la em cima, no começo era realmente f0da de jogar sozinho. Eu até tive a cara de pau de sair chamando usuarios aqui da Steam pra jogar junto a mim, mas foi tudo em vão, infelizmente kkkkkkkk. Masssss, acabei descobrindo que da pra colocar bots [IA] pra ajudar e facilitar a gameplay!!! E isso foi extremamente util. *-* 
Eles até atacam, mas no geral são bem ignorantes KKKKKKKKKK, o que de fato eles são bons é em te levantar quando você é derrubado por algum monstro, assim evitando que sua jornada seja finalizada precocemente!!!!! 

Os graficos até que são decentes. Os mapas e cenarios são bem variados! Alguns são curtos e outros extensos. A arte do jogo é legal e a trilha sonora é meio chatinha mas da pra se acostumar.
Uma coisa que eu não curti muito foi que pra jogar no controle é meio ruimzinho. Eu sugiro muito que se você puder, jogue com um mouse & teclado. No joystick da pra brinca de boa, mas vai por mim e confia no que eu to falando!!!!!!!!!! Outro ponto também é a fisica e movimentação dos bonecos. É tudo muito duro, meio travado! Parece que os bichos tão com 500kg de concreto nas roupas huehuehuehuehue. 
Mas enfim... creio eu que isso seja proposital do jogo mesmo. Até porque tem itens que te dão um pouqinho a mais de velocidade. 

E pra encerrar, se você quer muito jogar sofrendo o minimo possivel eu recomendo duas coisas: a primeira é que jogue com amigos e conhecidos!!!! Vai ser bemmmmmmm mais ""suave"" a caminhada de todos até ficarem full broken. E a segunda é, caso for jogatinar sozinho, compre a DLC chamada Artisan and Magician. Vai por mim, de longe este conteudo adicional é DISPARADO o melhor de todos. Ela possui uma personagem bem OP que vai melhorar bastante o seu early game. 

E é isso aew galera. Sem sombra de duvidas recomendo simmmmmmmmmm Gunfire Reborn a todo mundo!!!!!!!!!!! Muito obrigado a você que chegou até aqui, um forte abraço e nos vemos nas proximas analises. Até la, bjbjbjbj e fuyyyyyyyyyyyy :* õ/

Ich gebe dem Spiel eine 5/10 | This is the most simplistic of the trio of sandbox city builders I've played recently but it's also the oldest and cheapest one. There's just enough options to play with the lighting and color schemes for a different stylized city every time and you can carve some really creative cities once you get the hang of the tools and rules. Recommended if you're looking for a city builder game without the gameplay or a 3D modeling program without the learning curve.

There's not much to say about the building process because it's so simple... You left-click to place a block and right-click to remove a block. There's 15 colors to choose from, giving you a lot of creativity not only with color schemes but with the layout of the city: blocks ""react"" differently to connections depending on height, color, and terrain. The tools provided make it easy to put up a complex city in under half an hour, but it would go even faster if the tools were more PC-friendly. Unfortunately, there aren't bounding boxes to draw or remove multiple blocks at once, leaving you to place and remove everything individually. 

Some other wishlist items include options to manually choose flat or angled roofs, an option to click and drag to choose height, and more options for terrain. Currently you can make grass and bushes with closed loops of buildings, but there's no options for other foliage placement. There's also no options for unplaced terrain, meaning everyone is stuck living on the open ocean. Otherwise, the tools provided are simple enough that it's fun to just play with them and discover new things.

Townscaper is one of the few ""comfy"" games that I can safely recommend because of the low price point and the unique experience it provides. Tiny Glade provides a more robust experience, with more nuanced tools and more detailed environments, but this provides a much larger scale and a cleaner aesthetic. Worth checking out if you're on the fence about 3D art or if you just want to make some cute landscapes for social media."

 | Unlike many other strategy games, this Crusader Kings 3 isn't particularly hard to learn. Pretty much everything you need to do well is brought straight to you in the form of little prompts.

You can get it for full price if you really want but sales are pretty frequent and this game is definitely worth it on sale.

1. Full of bugs. Example you can stuck anywhere at all and can't move and last save is like an hour ago and you have completed a lot only to redo all again.
2. The save system is ridiculous. You can go for hours without triggering a save or even after completing a main quest. Probably another bugs.
3. No such thing as stealth if you're looking for one. Once you snipe for example, another isolated and far far away sniper, you will trigger and agroed whole enemies in the area, and they know where you are. No point in going stealth. 
4. Enemies can suddenly appear outta nowhere and they can see you from crazy distance.
I didn't get much fun with this one as I got from SGW2. None of these problems I encountered with the second one. Save your money and time and just play that one instead. | i feel that this is an adult game you have to think more about what you going to do and once you play the game you just dont stop there, every time I play it I play it differently I take different paths, I do the challengens that I wasnt able to do on a previous game. Its a challenging game Ive got the whole series. dont tire of it. Yes I would and do recomend it to my friends and familly.  its not a game for any body. Im waiting for the next game . that is after SGWC2. will they be another? | If you're looking for a sniper game then this is it. It is extremely enjoyable to stealthily eliminate enemy combatants either from mid-long range with your trusty sniper or up close with your sidearm or blade. The regions are cool and you can tell effort was made here to make them feel real. Most areas offer multiple ways around the enemy. 

That was the good, now the bad:

The enemy here are ok. The A.I can get stuck on occasion but the most frustrating part in this game is that they speak english. I don't understnad why make the enemy Siberians and then make them speak the worst Russian accent english I've ever heard. This is mind boggling to me. Nothing will ever break my immersion more than that.

Each mission has its own challenges. Some are fun to tackle, some make you use different tactics but others are just not worth the trouble and make the game not fun. Some challenges require you to break stealth and turning the place into a shooting gallery is just not enjoyable. The A.I is not the greatest for combat and it shows. Gun variety is ok but because you'll likely always want EMP bullets to deal with cameras or sentry turrets you'll only use 1 gun and ignore all the others. There's also a few .50 cal snipers that are obviously unsuppressed and I don't understand why they exist in a game Sniper GHOST WARRIOR. The moment you fire your first shot you're spotted. There's also a small variety of secondary weapons, ARs and Shotguns. You can't suppress any of them and I barely ever use them, I would rather not have one and instead have more sniper or pistol ammo.

I find that a lot of my complaints are very obvious to any casual sniper player. If they had made a Beta of this game they would have likely caught all this and fixed/adjusted things accordingly.

The 2nd game isn't all that better, especially not in the realism and there are many recycled assets to the point that the entire game should be DLC. Compared to what earlier games did this is a major disapointment. | Sniper: Ghost Warrior Contracts è un'esperienza di tiro tattico che combina l'abilità di mira precisa con l'elemento stealth. Il gioco ti pone nei panni di un cecchino mercenario che deve completare contratti uccidendo bersagli specifici.

По геймплею напоминает GR Wildlands, но на небольших полуоткрытых локациях.
Что понравилось: снайперская стрельба, разнообразие гаджетов, внешний вид карт и геймплей на полуоткрытых пространствах вроде вражеских баз.
Что не понравилось: разброс пистолета и автомата, система сохранений чекпоинтами, и плохо задизайненные кишкообразные участки карт, которые лучше проходить с боем, потому что иначе задушитесь проходить по стелсу (особенно финальная карта этим грешит)."

カード機能とかどうでもいいんだよコレだよコレ！ | I call this game a time sink because you start playing in the morning and next minute its dark outside. Recent changes to the trading companies are a bit rough for certain factions like Emirates, but fingers crossed the devs make it more frequent. Worth the buy, especially with friends | Game starts breaking down heavily towards higher populations. I recently played the game on Emperor difficulty (2 down from the highest) and it gave me a lot of words for the developers. population randomly vanishing when you decide to build port colonies. Wondering why my pops are fluctuating so much so I spend the time to watch a single farmer and not even 30 seconds later he's just gone, no notification telling me he starved to death or decided to move elsewhere. Speaking of watching pops, I think I watched a villager idle for a total of 35 in-game minutes waiting for him to deliver the beeswax I needed next to my candle makers. I play the game exclusively on the highest speed setting and maybe this contributes to the game just giving up on itself 18 different ways, but that's not really an excuse. I'd like to not have to waste my time for buildup that I am confident in. Another issue I found is after some time 3 of my 500 tile farms just became randomly inaccessible along with the housing and storage next to them. No reason given, no changes made by myself to the area they inhabited. removing the buildings and replacing them fixed the problem, but again that's more effort I'm having to manually place in a spot I assumed was taken care of.

In the current state of the game I would not recommend higher functioning beings to purchase the game as once you decide to test yourself on any difficulty higher than the first 3 you eventually want to start pulling your hair out after time sinking 6+ hours in a single save. Not to mention typical AI cheating shenanigans this game doesn't hide at all. Allowing the AI to triple your army size despite being a fraction of the pop size is... something of a design choice. | Plays similar to Banished, but with more content/ depth

Мне очень сильно понравилась, данная игра заслуживает внимания.
 Достоинства: Сюжет игры - если вы не станете её спидранить.
               Графика - хоть и настроек для неё мало но максимальных смотрится круто. 
                Локации - некоторые из них просто потрясающие.
               геймплей - очень интересный.
                Музыка - есть хорошее звуко-сопровождение. Особенно если соберёте все ноты для музыканта.
 Недостатки: не нашёл.
В общем и целом игра вышла просто отличной. Так-что советую к покупке. Особенно если вы любите такой тип и жанр игры. | I'm so happy I played Stray, it's a genuinely fun game. I enjoyed being a cat, jumping to places, scratching things. Loved the little sidekick too. The Zurks gave me some trouble as I don't play a lot of action games.

Parasal anlamda da bir sıkıntı kalmıyor. Parasına göre 30 saatlik içerik fazlasıyla yeterli. Bu arada oyundaki zaman gerçek hayattaki oyun sektörünün parodisi gibi ilerliyor. Telif problemi yaşamamak için firma ve oyun isimlerinde yapılan değişikler başlı başına komedi. Minisoft firmasının YBox 370 konsolu, Walve firmasının Full Life oyun serisi veya BlockStar firmasının Green Dead Redemption serisi filan bayağı iyi örnekler. | O jogo ilustra bem a história de como foi as etapas de desenvolvimento dos games no decorrer do tempo, junto com um aspecto bem diversificado de gameplay, algumas dificuldades são insanas se tentar sair arriscando em ideias novas ou até mesmo desenvolver um console. | esta bueno el juego, entretenido, pero la traducción del juego al español tiene algunos errores pequeños, y cuando uno distribuye uno mismo sus juegos, al menos yo, no siento como si hicera mas ganancia que cuando lo distribuye un editor, pero el resto bastante bien, divertido, yy no se que mas decir."

It was soooo difficult to keep going with Germany for instance, but came so close to maintaining office a few first times, that I knew I could do better. It's a massive puzzle game with a very simple interface that makes it easy to absorb the information and navigate the myriad of implications of your decisions. I'm still learning about the game, and wonder what the replayabillity is like once I figure out the massive puzzle, but so far it's very engaging and rewarding when I manage to continue as President in office. | Great game for people like me, who are chronically addicted to politics (it's not healthy). The game is definitely an improvement over Democracy 3. The UI, mod support and policy balance is improved. But the same old problem remains any politics addict with a strong ideological alingment. The game as a lib-left bend (although not as pronounced as in Democracy 4). Depending on your personal view, this might be a good or a bad thing. The game is harder with a free-market approach, although this can be balanced through mods. The game offers a lot of different countries to play in, but has a very american perspective on policy. 

I find myself resorting to my preferred political playstyle of free-market capitalism, but you can go ahead and experiment. I highly recommend this game. | Too expensive for what it is and a lot of the cause & effect makes very little sense - Why are the only contributing factors to environmental protests the state of the environment and how many environmentalists there are? Surely if Environmentalists are happy with my government they would be significantly less inclined to protest it? - meaning otherwise seemingly pointless policies need to be put in place like tear gas, water cannons, etc. that tank approval for literally no reason.

There's also too few positive situations and/or goals to achieve, which wouldn't be a huge deal if not for the fact that this being a simulation of democracy means there's no real endgame, it means a lot of the time unless you have something in mind to work towards there's not much impetus to play for very long at a time, no carrot on the end of the proverbial stick to keep encouraging you to work towards achieving it.

Worth a play if you see it at a significant discount during a sale, otherwise I would give it a miss. | I personally have had a lot of fun on this game! I like all the laws and such you can change. | This is a fun Game for those who like strategy, slow pace, and who like to govern. You can change policies to try winning an election or just to see what will happen if you start chipping people and freedom is taken. so many options. I enjoy it because I have 4 kids and 3 Dogs and a wife and a job so I can get up and walk away no pause needed. Per turn game."

The first couple of hours are actually pretty enjoyable, but after that there are almost no new mechanics being introduced, and the flaws that might've gone unnoticed before become more and more obvious.
[list]
[*] Diplomatic relations are very shallow, and there aren't many diplomatic options.
[*] There is no way to raid other gangs' rackets if they don't border the player directly, which makes no sense at all.
[*] Managing the ""Empire"" is a hassle because the player has to manually click through every precinct, every building, and every upgrade. There is no way to queue upgrades or build higher tiers of buildings from the start.
[*] There are only four kinds of ""rackets"" available for building, which is very limited considering the amount of available slots for building.
[*] The world map lacks any unique gameplay-relevant features, which make the world really bland and boring.
[*] The supply mechanic between your precincts is not engaging and could be realized in a more involved way.
[*] There is no way to speed up time on a strategic level, and there are quite a few things that require the player to simply wait for a relatively long time.
[*] After a few hours, combat becomes repetitive and there are a LOT of inconsequential fights against low-tier guards that the player has to fight to take over precincts.
[*] Autoresolve is absurdly unfair, which forces the player to fight even the battles that will take 1 or 2 turns to easily win (or to ""save scum"" for a few times).
[*] And many other small bugs and poor design decisions that frustrated me during my playthrough.

Many problems could be mitigated, and the gameplay could be significantly improved, but the game is abandoned, so it's very unlikely that we'll ever see any updates. | Bon rpg tactic dans l'univers de la mafia des années 20 mais trop de bug chiant qui te refait charger une partie.. Et vu que le jeu à plus de 4 ans je trouve cela abusé d'avoir ce genre de bug | Wouldn't bother. Game is fun but is abandonware. If you try and take out an enemy boss the game locks up. If all you ever want to do is upgrade your rackets there is a niche. But you cannot take out enemy factions. Spent 20 minutes killing a buildings worth of enemies and game froze upon completion. Reloaded as it may have been a solitary issue, It wasn't. Spent an hour re killing the same 11 people 3 times. Games borked | Its very fun and gives you a ton of reason to come back, but it has some bugs like getting stuck in a loading screen and etc, but other then that I love it! | I don't understand the bad rep this game received. Yes, it does suck that the game was abandoned, def had a lot of potential. But it is well worth the cost (specially on sale). I agree with other comments that it can get a little repetitive after the 15 hour mark but the game play itself is great. I wish there were more expansions, something to change it up mid-late game."
76561197974286855,1124300,HUMANKIND™,47.8,Strategy,13,"I still want to like this game. It's not that it could have been so much more, it's not that the 4x and combat elements are still too disconnected. It's quite simply that the actual gameplay is not fun. 
The case study that prompted me to write this review:
I'm playing a greedy game where I'm the only civ on my relatively large continent. I pick England and build Strongholds in various strategic locations. I own the whole continent and have lots of tech and buildings but a fairly small army - just enough to strongly defend a single attack point. I begin building ships to explore the world. I finally encounter another civ, then another. The world congress begins almost immediately. One of the civs demands 2000 gold from me. I naturally refuse. They push the issue to congress. I don't have an embassy yet, so I can't do anything about that, but fine. They won't be able to break into my continent. They pillage one of my two harbors. This gives them enough warscore to enforce peace, get the 2000 gold plus another 2400 gold for war reparations. I'm in bankruptcy. I work my way out of it. They demand 2000 gold again and now I can't refuse because my people don't want war.
What is the gameplay here? Pillaging a single district is enough to instantly end a war and enforce demands strong enough to cripple the enemy until you can immediately send more demands and declare war again? The war didn't even last long enough for me to attempt to fight it. I wouldn't mind if they enforced demands after they had landed a force and begun sieging my cities or thoroughly pillaged my entire coastline, but it was one single district. Honestly most games seem to end with one stupid mistake or lucky break, which is already not that fun, but you throw mechanics like that in and it just isn't worth trying anymore. | 慎玩。解决了文明系列的大部分问题，参考了文明系列的0项优点。 | I love this game. That Civ 7 is copying a lot of the mechanics that made this game different should tell you everything you need to know. | 人类议会做的什么玩意？会议让你割让领土，拒绝就开战然后就给你30支持度，关键你看不见人家，你打不着人家。每回合降支持度，拖到回合结束强制失败，直接把首都割给ai。你这是什么设计? | 4天前: 就算这游戏再烂, -85%也不是不能接受
今天: -100%都不行, 屎一样的体验.放到4x分类里面脏了隔壁文明, 放到shit分类下面反倒恰如其分.幽默的战斗机制+基本等于没有的经济发展系统直接毁了游戏体验."
76561197974286855,1485590,ENDLESS™ Dungeon,0.25,"Action, Strategy",0,"I wish I could recommend this game to play, but I just can't. I'll start with the negatives that force this review the way it is.
Negatives:
 - The game is absolutely RIDDLED with bugs, mostly audio and visual. These have led to many deaths due to not showing where enemy attacks are at, displaying attacks for much longer than they actually are active for (including from previous floors sometimes), and not properly displaying where your abilities will damage.
 - About 50% of the stats you can gain are either unclear on how they work, work in a completely different way, or just don't work at all.
 - All of these problems only get worse when they add new content to the game. None of the previous bugs are being fixed unless they actually soft-lock the run.

Positives:
 - Everything about the design for this game I absolutely love. The visual design of enemies, characters, and abilities is fantastic. Everything feels like it is part of one cohesive universe and is really beautiful.
 - The music gets its own line because GOD DAMN I love this game's music. I have been listening to the entirety of the soundtrack almost nonstop since the game released. I haven't seen a game match the classic rock feel like endless dungeon does.
 - The characters feel good gameplay wise. There are a lot of synergies between each character that really make a run feel good if you take upgrades that work with each other (comrade and sweeper probably being the strongest example). I'd say that they all feel great independently as well (besides blaze, I don't understand how to make him work).
 - Almost all of the weapons feel satisfying to use and building around and endless gun you find early can be really fun. Having 2 different weapons for 2 different purposes or swapping between 2 really slow weapons to basically fire both at the same time.
 - The new content they added (when working properly) has been great for adding diversity in your runs. I really enjoy the card system at the start of each floor and the enemy buffs that influence where you travel to.

That should be all there is on my thoughts for this game. If it worked properly it would be one of my absolute favorites, but the game is and has been absolutely broken for too long. I still remain hopeful that they continue support for this game so i have a reason to recommend it to friends, but given that it has been almost a year and a half with hardly any bugfixes and only more bugs added there is not much to back that hope with. | Huge fan of the Endless series. Played Dungeon of the Endless, had lots of fun with friends. Played this game with friends too. I love the tactical elements of good turret positioning and identifying choke points, and strategizing over which doors to keep closed and which areas we should explore. Resources management, picking your favourite upgrades, comprimising and trying new things when you don't get what you want - this game is EXTREMELY fun

The game just crashed on me (presumably a memory leak somewhere) and my save was wiped.

0/10 will never open this game again unless if there's a way to restore my save, and if they fix the crash bug. It was horrible enough that my game crashed on an unbelievably good run we had, but now I have to start from square one. Very cool. | I picked this game up to play with friends, but it is just as good in single player! Interesting hub / roguelite elements that remind me of Hades along with a nice soundtrack. The combat in each mission has a flow to it that is surprisingly relaxing. It can be casual or you can use modifiers to spice up your runs for more rewards.

You get plenty of resources to build your turrets and buy upgrades, but have to pay close attention that your crystal bot (escort NPC) does not get hit. Most missions I lose can be attributed to saving my resources for no good reason and being unprepared for a horde wave.

I would recommend this game for solo and group players. It's pretty casual but can go bad quickly if you aren't paying attention. | Careful listening to the bad reviews here. A lot of them are due to the fact they wanted this to be a sequel to Dungeon of the Endless and it is not. It is its own game and it does it very solid. It leans a little farther into action game than tower defense, but I felt the progression and gameplay was great. | Only reviewing because of the large amount of mixed reviews. 

Bought on sale for 60%, and at that price, it’s worth it. 

I haven’t experienced any bugs others have mentioned. 

It’s its own game, so people complaining about it not a being direct sequel and being different from Dungeon of the Endless are worth ignoring if you just want to play this game for what it is. 

It’s fun for what it is. At 14 hrs, I can tell it’s going to start feeling repetitive, but if you’re looking for something to scratch the rogue-like itch, with a basic tower defense angle thrown in, it’s worth purchasing on deep sale."
76561197974286855,924970,Back 4 Blood,76.18333333333334,Action,27,"A primeira vez que zerei esse jogo anos atrás pela game pass no lançamento sinceramente não gostei muito, achei bem inferior ao Left4Dead (impossível de não comparar). Mas rejogando agora pela Steam depois de anos de atualizações e acréscimos parece outro jogo, tá muito melhor, principalmente pela jogabilidade ter ficado mais fluída e responsiva e ter o nível de dificuldade fácil (que não tinha antes). Em comparação ao Left, esse é mto melhor na movimentação e controles, é tudo mais dinâmico e simples, e o sistema de cartas foi um acréscimo bem-vindo (no começo pensei que seria chato e confuso, mas no final das contas vcê vai desbloqueando cartas que só dão benefícios para vcê e sua equipe, e caso vcê não queira montar seu baralho de perks basta jogar na dificuldade mínima em que as cartas nem se fazem necessárias pra zerar o jogo).

Os personagens possuem personalizações básicas de roupas, assim como as armas, e vcê vai desbloqueando tudo com pontos ganhos ao completar as fases (assim como as cartas). No total a campanha dura cerca de 6-8 horas na dificuldade mínima, e os dois atos extras são DLCs pagas, sendo que cada ato extra dura no máximo 1 hora. No geral só recomendo comprar as DLCs se vcê for jogar em grupo, pois assim só UMA pessoa do grupo precisa ter as DLCs (o Host da partida) e todos do grupo conseguem jogar as fases só comprando o jogo base que fica baratinho em promoção. Sobre o designer e layout dos mapas achei melhores no left4dead, pois no Back4Blood os mapas começam legais e criativos nos três primeiros atos, porém os outros três atos (incluindo as DLCs) perderam a criatividade e só criaram mapas simples e curtos (exceto pela fase do museu da segunda DLC que é a única fase extra realmente boa na minha opinião). 

E falando nisso o Ato 4 é o mais curto de todos, pois se resume em um “final boss”. É um confronto desafiador e divertido, porém rápido. Vcê enfrenta um monstro gigante e se comprar as DLCs enfrenta o mesmo monstro, mas com mecânicas diferentes, na última fase do ato 6. Achei divertido e diferenciado, são os únicos Bosses colossais de verdade do jogo, algo que não existe no Left, por exemplo. Sobre os tipos de zombies é na mesma pegada do Left, existem várias mutações diferentes, nem tem como falar mto prqê alguns são cópias do Left tipo o que cospe bile e o que parece o Hunter e precisa de ajuda de alguém da equipe pra salvar a pessoa que foi pega (mas pra PVP achei melhores os especiais do Left, os daqui tem várias variações de um mesmo zombie que fazem qse a mesma coisa, e não tem ataques rápidos e estratégicos igual no Left).

Por fim no modo campanha pelo menos sempre entra gente aleatória na partida (aceitando cross-play), caso seu grupo esteja incompleto (máximo de quatro jogadores coop online). Uma coisa que odiei é não ter o vote kick, então se algum palhaço entrar na partida e ficar xingando ou não quiser entrar na safe room pra acabar a fase no final do mapa não tem como expulsar a pessoa, só denunciar, o que não resolve nada. O único jeito de expulsar é qndo a pessoa fica AFK (ausente) ou exagera no team damage (dano em amigos), que aí aparece uma mensagem falando que o jogador se tornou “expulsável” da partida, fora isso não tem como expulsar trolls, o jeito é suportar ou sair da partida, o que é bem chato. Com isso recomendo fortemente Back4Blood para fãs de Left4Dead e jogos de zumbis cujo objetivo é atravessar mapas diferenciados enfrentando hordas de zumbis e criaturas especiais enquanto completa objetivos e sobrevive em equipe. É de fato uma boa experiência e dá pra se divertir por pelo menos 20 horas até começar a enjoar, já que não tem mto o que fazer além de ficar repetindo mapas e explorando as áreas secretas (os “ninhos” subterrâneos dos zumbis) em troca de pontos para desbloquear mais cartas e itens cosméticos. | No, the majority of the game is behind a paywall. You need to purchase not 1, not 2 but 3 DLCs to progress with the story and gameplay. | I played opening day. I only come back now to write the review that I should have written a long time ago. This game falls short of its predecessors for many reasons. One of which is this misleading advertising that this game was made by previous left 4 dead devs Secondly, the glitches make it no fun. Third, every base game mission, not dlc, starts in the exact same spot and you need to fight through the exact same area multiple times. It makes the environment boring. The last thing I'll say, is that this game doesn't have open modding The reason that L4D2 still has a thriving playbase is that valve knew to allow modding. From custom maps, weapons, skins, and all without having to pay for what the developers make that I don't want to buy. 

If this game is ever given modding support, then you might actually see a resurgence in players The cards are a really cool aspect and the graphics are easily better the left 4 dead. Its missing the charm and love for the community that valve showed for the originals | 原价买有点亏，但是史低玩超级值！新入手建议直接买终极版。关卡设计都挺有意思，只是比起打丧尸更像是打异形？一路喊着好恶心啊啊啊啊的打通关了 | Por favor, denle otra oportunidad, el juego es buenísimo, entretenido, también tiene buena dificultad, con amigos más divertido, lo malo es que es muy caro, esperen ofertas, llega a costar solo 9 soles"

It has a clever way of bundling cards with car upgrades and allowing you to customize constantly.  The strategy is pretty solid.  It gets a tad repetative but it's lots of fun and I hope they add complexity via expansions and new game modes. | Yeah, this is an excellent game.

But it isn't without a few bumps and the occasional pothole.

The tutorial doesn't cover some fairly important mechanics and, whilst once you grok how to read the cards things get quite a bit easier, the presentation of the cars is a little lacking in that it isn't clear at first how priorities work, in what sequence certain things happen, and generally, there are quite a few moving parts under the bonnet (hood for our North American friends).

But once you get behind the wheel for a few runs, the handling starts to make sense, and you can put some pretty satisfying builds together. 

I'm a dabbler in deck builders but hardly a committed theory-crafter. I do get the impression that there is less variety of potential builds in this than in some other deckkies, but your mileage may vary. I'm probably not the best to make a definitive judgement on that front.

I'm judging the game purely on whether I enjoyed my time with it, and it's a definite yes.

It's a green light from me!

One game takes ~ half an hour and there are a good amount of maps + starting positions with ranging difficulties. | I think while it’s a good game it’s not for me and that’s why I have to leave this review. It’s so zoomed out, that it’s really just a math and spatial puzzle. The theme really doesn’t come through much at all. It’s all about optimizing your position on the board but there’s no asymmetry or theme beyond what terrain a space is. 

Just not in depth or thematic enough to hold my interest for more than the 12 hours I put in. 

I do wish the developer luck in their next project though, because there are some good ideas here. | Love it, definitely recommend the game. Especially if its on sale.

What makes the game so good is its simplicity as in ""easy to learn, hard to master"". You will not be bothered with 500 different mechanics like in Civilization but if you want to, you can still make it challenging. I also like that you can finish a round in one sitting. And even if you don't, you can come back to a game later and won't need long to figure out where you left things.

The DLC does not add new mechanics, so you do not need to buy the complete edition but can start with the base game. | There is nothing wrong with a game being basic, but then the gameplay that exists has to be stellar. I don't think the gameplay in this game is good enough for a recommendation, although it's not terrible either. In my longest game I was waiting for random troop boost cards, turn after turn, to give me enough +strength to do anything. | Incredibly fun 4x game that usually takes about an hour or so for an entire campaign.

Nothing about it sounded fun. But then I watched a video of someone playing it on YouTube and thought it looked much more fun than the promotional videos had shown. So I gave it a try and OMG, I totally enjoyed this game. It has no right to be as fun as it is. I tend to be a completionist and this game helped scratch that itch. The best part is that I'm a huge fan of Castlevania so that DLC was just the greatest thing I never knew I needed. Seriously, for me the Castlevania DLC made the game at least 10x more fun.

My only complaint would be it's kind of a one and done for me. Once everything is collected I don't feel a need to play it. Loved playing it that first time around though, collecting all the things, unlocking all the stuff, it was fantastic. I'd have to do a complete fresh install to relock everything to make unlocking it again enjoyable. But still, it was the best 190+ hours of my recent gaming life :D | It's a fun game where you survive 30 minutes at a time (15 with hurry mode or endless when unlocked) as hordes of enemies crowd your screen and you get ever increasingly ridiculous weapons. A good number of hours out of it, especially for the price point. There's a lot of characters, different weapons, evolutions, secrets, stages etc. Sometimes things get so ridiculous that you can't even see what's going on anymore, but it's all part of the charm of the game.

I don't really have any critiques, because it does what it sets out to very well. I will say though that the game is considerably easier than I expected it was going to be going in. | A lot of people like it but I honestly found it kind of boring. Just wander around automatically shooting stuff until you get overwhelmed, then repeat. It's fine but wasn't my kind of game. | Literalmente el juego del vicio a su máximo esplendor, el trailer habla por si solo, vas a dejar tu vida jugando a este juego para conseguir todos los desbloqueables y probar todas las combinaciones o personajes posibles.

El contenido que obtienes de juego por lo que pagas es totalmente justo, ya poseo todos los DLC hasta la fecha y realmente cada uno suma una cantidad de contenido absurdo que da para aun mas horas de juego.

Además, como fan de la saga Castlevania es muy divertido ir notando cada una de las referencias que guarda este juego y cuando añadieron el DLC de Castlevania, literalmente explote.
 | This game has the best ratio between the amount of fun you'll have with the fewest amount of buttons. I've never played anything this deep with literally just WSAD and Space. Also, 5€ full price for this? What a bargain. I get that it's a simple game, but come on. Give yourselves some credit, devs. And thanks for the full ultrawide support, although I would prefer a third option to solid and transparent black bars, which would be no black bars, but that's a massive nitpick.

EDIT: Ooooooh! That's how they make money! They have DLCs, so the whole game is actually 20€ if you want everything. That makes way more sense. Still too cheap though, because from what I've tried from the DLCs so far, they are very good and definitely worth the asking price."

76561197974286855,1940340,Darkest Dungeon® II,14.9,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",22,"After spending over 900 hours immersed in Darkest Dungeon 2, I can confidently say it is a challenging yet rewarding masterpiece. The game strikes a balance between punishing difficulty and the exhilaration that comes with overcoming it. If you're looking for a game that demands strategic thinking, and rewards adaptability, this is it.

Initially, I found the level of randomization in the game—particularly at launch—to be overwhelming. Too often, failure felt like the result of bad luck rather than poor decision-making. However, the developers have worked  to address this issue through a series of updates and balance changes, creating an experience where every loss feels like an opportunity to learn and grow. Today, success in Darkest Dungeon 2 is far more about your strategic choices, your understanding of the game mechanics, and your knowledge of enemy behavior. This shift has made victories feel even more gratifying and defeats less frustrating - most of the time :)

One of the most impressive aspects of the game is how it encourages experimentation.  Every team composition is now viable—a huge improvement from the early days when certain combinations felt sub-optimal. With a bit of understanding of game mechanics and enemy abilities, you can succeed with any group of characters, which has transformed Darkest Dungeon 2 into a sandbox of tactical possibilities.

The journey itself—navigating the game’s haunting, beautifully rendered landscapes—is unforgettable. Every step feels consequential, and every decision matters. Whether you’re managing your team’s stress levels, deciding which encounters to tackle, or weighing the risks of pushing your luck for better rewards, the game constantly challenges your ability to think ahead and adapt on the fly. The tension is relentless, but it’s this very pressure that makes every small victory feel monumental.

Another standout feature of Darkest Dungeon 2 is its community. The game’s fans are incredibly supportive, and the tight-knit nature of the player base fosters a sense of camaraderie that’s rare in today’s gaming landscape. Whether you’re looking for tips, sharing war stories, or just enjoying the creativity of small but dedicated content creators, there’s always something to engage with. The content creators, in particular, deserve praise for consistently producing entertaining and insightful material that enhances the overall experience.

In its current state, Darkest Dungeon 2 has become everything I hoped it would be and more. It’s a game that demands your respect, tests your resolve, and rewards your persistence. While it’s not for the faint of heart, for those willing to embrace its challenges, the payoff is unparalleled. Whether you’re a seasoned veteran or a newcomer, this is a journey worth taking—a journey into madness, perseverance, and triumph. Darkest Dungeon 2 isn’t just a game; it’s an experience, one I’m thrilled to recommend to anyone who dares to face its horrors. | [h1] YES, IT IS NOT DARKEST DUNGEON 1! [/h1]

However, this game deserves a way higher rating. It is fun, it is well made, it is unique experience.
Unfortunately its main game loop takes away several aspects that Darkest Dungeon 1 players enjoy so much.
This explains the sour ratings for an otherwise highly enjoyable game.

What is different:
Instead of slowly restoring your hamlet, your heroes travel the landscape with a stagecoach.
The expeditions are long and follow a roguelike gameloop. You can choose which regions to travel to and, like in many other roguelike/roguelite titles, select the next waypoint from a choice of 2 or 3 options.

Positives:
1. First off.. the greatest thing about it.. THE SOUNDTRACK. 
Stuart Chatwood filled this game with a bunch of absolute bangers: Sprawl Battle, Traverse the Mountain and Battle of the Mountain - these songs will put you on edge in epic decisive battles, where small mistakes will be even more punished than in the first iteration of the game. Sprawl Battle became my personal most heard song on Spotify.
2. The graphics are great. The pre-move animations add a lot of life and dynamic action in comparison to the more static first Darkest Dungeon. The winddown animations are just beautiful too.
3. The relationships between characters are a fantastic addition. Unluckily, it became a bit too easy to always get good relationships, which often makes the game a lot easier. Unluckily the powered up moves are random and sometimes just useless.
4. The boss fights can be hard if you bring the wrong team comp. To me, these harder fights are very enjoyable. Beating the boss with one man standing basically in the last swing was a very amazing and memorable experience.
5. The token system adds a bit more consistency in your battle plan. For most players, this might be an improvement. I personally enjoyed the randomness of the first part a little more.
6. The reflection shrines tell the stories of the heroes and are really cool.
7. The narrator (June Wayne) delivers once again and the lines slap hard. Yet, most lines feel less iconic than the first part.
8. Less micromanagement.

Negatives:

1. There is no gravitas when failing a run or when a characters dies. You don't lose them. You can just select them again in your next run. This bitter aspect of the first Darkest Dungeon is what made it so thrilling. Here you can basically end a run early with little consequences. Sometimes it is the best course of action to abandon midway and cut your losses.
2. Good team comps are limited. You can't play some goofy stuff anymore like 4 Lepers.
3. Decisions along the way have no impact. You decide on whatever resource you need most in the moment.
4. Many beloved characters are missing in the base game and are trickling in with DLCs. As things are progressing right now, getting the full DD1 roster in the future might cost you another 50-100 bucks.
5. Camping is replaced by the inn, which is less immersive. The fear of ambushes and the little moments of respite inside the dungeons was a great touch.
6. Spending a few hours just to get smacked by a boss or miniboss is pretty bitter. Yes, you can upgrade a bunch of stuff and it was not completely for naught. But the upgrades are whatever.
7. Many paths of the heroes are inferior to other paths and for me there is no reason to play semi-useless builds.
8. Some characters are strong and they play nicely (e.g. Highwayman and Man-At-Arms). Some characters are quite weak like the Runaway.

Conclusion:
It is not Darkest Dungeon 1. It is still a fantastic game. Some gameplay mechanics are better, some are worse.
The DLC money-squeeze is a bit of a turn-off. Especially hiding already designed characters behind a paywall is a huge no-no.

This game is not a ""remake"" of DD1. They didn't ""take away features"". Red Hook have made it abundantly clear that Darkest Dungeon 2 is it's own game and while it has the same art style and battle system of the first game (thus why it's called Darkest Dungeon 2 and not something else like other reviews say it should be) it should be viewed as it's own experience rather then compared to a almost totally different game.

I have hundreds of hours in both games and I love them both dearly for their own merits. If you prefer DD1's long campaign and are not a fan of DD2's rougelike confessions mode or the shorter campaign in kingdoms mode. That's totally fine! DD1 isn't going anywhere and you can go and play that right now. But just because you prefer how DD1 did things, it doesn't make DD2 a bad game. It just means you prefer DD1's gameplay loop. The last thing Red Hook wanted to do when making DD2 was make DD1 obsolete so they tried their hardest in not making Darkest Dungeon 2 just more of Darkest Dungeon 1. This is the key thing you need to realise when getting into DD2 when you're a long time DD1 player.

Sadly because of the recent negative reviews I felt like I needed to go on this long rant but I will quickly gush a little about this game for people who are completely new to the series and want to give this game a try.

Darkest Dungeon 2 is a wonderful experience I would strongly recommended to any turn based RPG fan, especially if you're looking for something a little tougher since this game does not pull any punches. The art style is beautiful gothic horror and despite the dreary look, the game's theme of hope is extremely uplifting and inspiring. It is all tied together by Wayne June's (R.I.P) excellent narration. Needless to say, I highly recommend giving this game a try. Good luck and remember that in each of us there is a hopeful light holding fast against the hellish shadows that gather between our good intentions."

76561197974286855,597180,Old World,29.483333333333334,"Simulation, Strategy",56,"Old World (OW) is brilliant in its design and the experience it creates. OW is the most interesting, if not the best, 4x, tactical, turn based strategy currently! Complex, challenging and fun!

(MANY) POSITIVES
1 AN AMAZING PACE: OW has a brilliant mechanic of Orders that limits how much you can do in a turn. Everything, but production in cities, costs Orders: moving and using workers, scouts, army, attacking, council tasks, interactions with courtiers and nations. Each turn you think, prioritize and make choices. 
This way everything in OW feels earned. Because of the Orders limitation even in the late game a war can be exhausting for your empire. Moving many army units can deplete your Orders pool, not leaving any for workers, heir education, or scouts. Of course things get easier with time, but still you can find yourself vulnerable. One of the rare strategy games where the late game is cool!

2 CLEVER SYNERGY OF THE GAME'S SYSTEMS
In OW everything relates in a deep, satisfying way. Opinions of you impact how well armies fight, productivity of your cities, courtiers interactions with you. Resources and Buildings have efficiency combinations. All systems of OW interact.

3 TACTICAL WARS WITH PROPER AI
OW has competent AI that plays the game properly. It's perhaps a 4x game with one of the better AIs I've played against. In a war it tries to flank you for max damage, shoot from hills for maximum range, use forests to minimize ranged damage etc. War in OW is tactical. Flanking, units adjacency, terrain, and preparation (you can't heal in a neutral land, unless you have certain skills) - it all matters. 

4 DIPLOMACY IS COMPLEX AND CRUCIAL
Diplomacy in OW has two levels: internal and international with Opinions mechanic that synergizes with other systems. 
In OW you don't just establish cities of your civilization. With each new city you choose a renown family to run it (3 families each game out of 4 options; each nation has a different set). They have different bonuses, interactions with terrain, demands and limits to what character can govern their city. This way cities are different to each other. The Families opinion matters. Low Family opinion affects the maintenance of their cities. Armies you produce belong to the families and their combat effectiveness synergizes with your internal diplomacy as well (including General's opinion of you if one is added to an army).
On top of that you also have individual characters (courtiers) with friendships, love affairs, rivalry, assassinations, ambitions (power hungry), or significant public popularity (Rising Stars that can overthrow you). You also have civil wars where you may end up destroying your own city. 
Wars in OW can be intense and can significantly compromise what you can do in a turn. It really pays off to prevent war with a political marriage, even with a tribal leader against the public opinion, than risk invasions on multiple fronts. Besides, happiness in attacked cities tanks down and this can trigger further problems (unhappiness raises city's maintenance and a chance of rebellion). War in OW is a big deal: victories can boost your Legitimacy, but defeats break it. You need alliances and proper diplomacy to secure survival. You invest in building trust (Opinion) for more diplomatic options. 

5 The BARBARIANS, TRIBES AND FIXED CITY SPOTS
Besides different nations OW has Barbarians and 6 different tribes. Tribes may occupy vast or smaller map space with their camps. And the tribes in OW can be devastating. Each camp spawns units every few years and if too many they become raiders, even if you're at peace with them. You can get unexpected mini invasions where they pillage, attack cities and wound/kill workers. So your city placement, armies stationing and natural barriers like mountains play a role. 
There are benefits to defeating tribes and to alliances with them. In OW you have fixed city settlement locations. A few guaranteed ones at the start; more you get from warfare or diplomacy. I think the fixed City Spots improve the game significantly. There's no dumb AI settling a city on your border for irrational tensions. And a wide expansion makes you think and plan how you can secure distant, new cities. 
Overall, the tribes in OW add a lot of tension, threat and historical sensitivity that I really like.

6 ECONOMY WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF RESOURCE TYPES
All resources matter and you can run short of something even in the late game. Access to the best units is not just a matter of tech, but also depends on the level of your culture, a chain of buildings and multiple resources to maintain them.

7 DYNAMIC, MORTAL CHARACTERS
Playing as a mortal ruler, that you develop in stats and traits, is more fun than having one fixed option throughout eras.
I love the Archetypes for Characters, with different layers of bonuses when acting as the Leader, Governor or army Commander. For Instance a Builder Leader can assign multiple workers to a project and they have -1 turn to build improvements and more. 
It's also brilliant that courtiers' stats contribute to the resources pool of your empire. Giving them a job provides a yearly experience, thus upgrades. Using courtiers missions gives them even more experience. This way even having spy agents in foreign empires benefit your resources pool. Its a dynamic system where you want to use courtiers, they change and play an important role. 

8 EVENTS THAT BRING FLAVOR AND VARIETY
OW claims to have over 3 thousand events!!! Some go in chains and develop over time. Some involve historic characters and situations. I love that the OW events pop up with jingle sounds! Big, immersive windows with beautiful art! Love all the art of Wonders especially – they represent so well the grand scale of these projects! My favorite events are when a courtier becomes inspired by my empire's wonder (that they aren't just buildings with buffs) and when a battles winning general becomes a Rising Star and creates a political threat. It's empire AND character building together with storytelling.

9 there is DEPTH, NUANCES, AND HISTORIC SENSITIVITY
So many things in OW make it's ""world"" alive and interesting beyond the clickfest of developing tiles or attacking.
When your worker is wounded it builds a turn longer. 
When you're allied with a tribe you control their units. And when ravaged by war a Tribe can ask you for refuge, creating slums in your city. 
Scouts in OW can do many things and remain useful. From providing Legitimacy for discovered landmarks, to harvesting resources and spying. With proper tech, a Scout can establish spy network in foreign city. Then your spies can provide you with vision and destabilization options; for instance you can try to trigger rebellions in several cities at once right before you attack. All these in a Civilization like game!!!

I also like that the Tech options are semi-random.

10 ART STYLE, (fantastic) MUSIC, and ATMOSPHERE
Music in the OW is just AWESOME! Sometimes I just keep playing OW because I enjoy its soundtrack so much. 
It's a good looking game that sticks to one period of history but with depth and atmosphere. This way playtime isn't that long, but isn't short either. Due to the Orders mechanic limitations other players turns go fast, so less waiting time.

LAST BUT NOT LEAST
The game has never crashed for me.
I haven't found OW to be overwhelming to learn. It took me around 10 hours to become familiar with all the basics. OW has an excellent in-game encyclopedia.
The game is very customizable. 
The base game of OW has the full, good experience and not hiding crucial features behind paid DLCs. 
OW is first and foremost a great strategy game (with RPG flavor). It has a healthy complexity, depth, historic references, and fulfilling struggle.

NEGATIVES
In spite of symmetrical design, I've got an impression some nations are much better than others. I'm still figuring out if it's inflexibility of my playstyle or design's imbalance. | I am a university professor, game developer, and 4X TBS game fanatic. I played, developed, collaborated on, play tested, analyzed, wrote about, and searched for 4X TBS games most of my life. 
I played thousands of games and tens of thousands of hours of TBS games. I make this post after 300 hours of playing Old World. My estimated level of knowing and understanding Old World and its features: 60%.
Far from being perfect, but my perception is that Old World is currently the second best game out there. (I may be biased to 4X TBS, although I played many other genres).
Old World has the usual big problems with the UI: cumbersome, confusing, slow, buggy. Its AI seems to be somewhat better than the other 4X TBS AIs. As of today, 4X TBS AIs without exception are very poor based on my personal experience with hundreds of these games. 
But Old World’s design is one of the best I have seen so far in any 4X TBS game. Finally, I see Order Points that limit the number of actions per turn and limit my movements. I advocated for this for 30 years in 4X TBS development. This game has great feature diversity, depth, and attention to details. Many things can be customized, even the music. I am yet to try the multiplayer. The developers genuinely understand and care about their product which combo is rare to find in the 4X TBS genre. This is not just another dumbed down “clone” of an earlier game that dominates the 4X TBS market today. They still push new patches which is great. This game is similar to Civilization 4, but much better. It also has tactical depth, role playing, and probabilistic planning, and a lot more. Kudos to the developers and I wish they will provide many years of support to fix the bugs, improve the UI, further tune the balance, and strengthen the AI to make the game even better than now.
 | This game cheats during combat. Making moves the player can't make. 
The Computer always has 2,000 Shields, which allows it to Force March troops, even after spending all of those points to move troops or attack. 
EVERY army the AI has, has a General in it. 
The AI brings back Generals the next turn.
It's oppressive. 
90% of the Events that happen are bad for you, or negative, or cause negative effects.
It's way too hard to be peaceful and ally with another nation. 
No matter what you do, what tech you have, or how good you are with other AI players, they backstab you.
The Orders system is F'd, because you're restricted every turn, and you can't DO everything you need to do in your turn, like fight a war. If your king/queen has less Orders (moves) than the enemy and you have to fight a war, you're already dead. I hate it. 
I've been trying to deal with this since I got the game, and have disliked it, and the further I get into a game, the worse it becomes. This ONE issue is enough to make me never play it again.

I've been spending up to 12 hours a day in this game for days now, and it's just stupidly overpowered against the player. Just when you start to get things right, the game sh_its on you. I had a few years of absolute peace, and building up my army and building up my cities, only to get absolutely rolled by the AI, who always had better tech, had more troops, and never ran out of Generals. 
The movement across mountains, or using more Shield points than it should have to move troops is what did it for me. 
I know the AI cheats in every game vs. Humans, but this is ridiculous. 
F this game. It's got so many problems that Civ doesn't have. It's like they looked at Civ and went, ""You know, how do we make the game way harder, and more difficult at the same time?... Oh, I know! We'll add families and traits, and negative events THAT NEVER STOP every turn so the player never wins...""
Also, this game will make your computer get really hot, max our your fans on your GPU, and has a conflict with Medal where it makes Medal tell you it's going to record the game every 5 min. 
I had 2 cores heat up to 92c, which NEVER happens. And maxed out all of my P-Cores to min of 80c. (80-92c) That's insane!
I have a 13900K (Yes, I did the BIOS update to keep it from melting.) with a Lian Li 360 AIO running at full speed 100% of the time, and a total of 7 fans. 32GB of DDR5, and a 2080Super. I watch HWMointor because this game makes my computer a Space Heater. I watch voltages, I watch clock speeds on all cores, and I watch temperatures. No other game does this to my machine.
I don't know how people play this and are OK with it. 
I'll probably uninstall.
Don't buy it. It's not what you think it is. 
Just go play Civ and be happy. | I cannot describe just how much this game has come to dominate my life in the last two years. I've racked up over 1200 hours and I'm only jut starting to ease up.

Old World looks, feels and plays like it was made by 4X fans for 4X fans. It remedies so many of the genre's pitfalls, and the replay value is through the roof. The mix of nations, families, events and characters give each and every game a different flavour. The developers have also kept it consistently patched and tweaked. Cannot recommend it enough, this game beats any other in the genre. | Eine Partie Old World zu spielen ist für mich immer etwas besonderes.Jedesmal erlebe ich eine neue Geschichte und es ist einfach spannend.Fazinierend wie die Entwickler dieses auf die Beine gestellt haben.Wie die ganzen Mechaniken im Spiel ineinander greifen und ein so motivierendes immersives Spielerlebnis erzeugen.
Vorausgesetzt man lässt sich darauf ein.Denn es kann auch hart sein eine Partie zu spielen.Es kann frustrierend sein schlechte Zeiten zu überwinden oder mit  mehreren Kriegen konfrontiert zu werden.Sich dort durchzusetzen macht auch einen besonderen Reiz von Old World  aus.Für mich das beste 4x Game auf dem Markt.

It combines a campaign map with turn based battles. You can create your own civilization with its ruler and heroes, and play as the fantasy (or steam-punk) civilization you always wanted.

But I have some bigger issues with this game:

First off, since the last big update, the game has a tendency to crash on the campaign map. Which is really annoying, but dealbreaker for me is, that it also corrupts saves, so you cannot continue where it crashed. Especially annoying when you just fought a big battle and then lose all your progress.

Second is, that yes - you can create different civs - but in the end, they all play very similar. You always want to rush your city cap and just build as many armies as possible. Build wide, claim as much territory as possible. That's the strategy. The only difference is how your units look and what tomes you unlock. To be fair, some of the final tomes are very unique, but it takes a very long time till you get there and most of the game is already over by that point.

Third, the campaign map itself. You notice it is randomly generated. It's a combination of biomes with some features in it and some randomly placed ancient wonders. Every map looks similar. Sometimes it has more forest and sometimes more sand, but in the end, there are no ""unique"" landmarks or sights. After a few games, you have seen everything. Which would be okay, but one of the key points of this game is to go out and explore the map... which is just not interesting.

 | Отличная игра, лучше взять ее чем отдать 7к за базовую цивилизацию 7.:) | It's a good game. Early game is a blast. Middle game is so so. End game is boring.

I have the same problem with this game as with Total War series -- late game battles are boring and tedious, zero fun.
