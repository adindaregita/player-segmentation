76561198004559773,1,Rise of the Ronin,"Action, Adventure, RPG",Recommended,"Game can be fun when combat parry is consistent but it almost never is. Progression feels less about you mastering your fighting technique and more about overleveling in order to tank enemy hits you think you should be able to parry but can't. So victories, especially in the latter part of the game, largely feel unearned because its not that your parry skills got better, its that you can take significantly more hits than you can dish them. Parry window is microscopic, enemies have nonstop delayed attacks, can speed up or slow down in attack animations which further throws you off and can chain multiple attacks that are either too fast to parry or don't allow you to parry thus destroying your stamina and rendering you unable to move or attack. Because the game relies so heavily on you blocking until you can parry to stagger the final attack in a chain, its extremely rigid and doesn't offer a lot of flexibility except in the weapon you choose. An enemy can pause the next attack in their 4 attack chain but there's literally nothing you can do except pray the parry rng works in your favor. A better game would allow you to recognize and react to that slow attack but ROTR removes any choice. You wait until the final attack in the chain to stagger, attack then wait again for the end of the next attack chain. Someone put it best: RotR is a rhythmless rhythm game with the 'rhythmless' referring to the lack of consistency in parry timing. Rise of the Ronin is like Seikero if the devs decided to be misanthropic towards its players instead of designing a competent combat system that feels difficult BUT fair. RotR is only difficult BECAUSE its unfair and utterly obtuse in how you deal with any combat encounter.",45.5 hrs on record																					(36.1 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198004559773,1,Kingdom Come: Deliverance II,"Action, Adventure, RPG",Recommended,This game is fun. Very easy to get lost exploring or doing side quests or meeting interesting NPCs.

76561198004559773,1,Sniper Elite: Resistance,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"Its fine but feels sparse in many ways. The maps feel significantly less substantial than those in S5 and S4, both in scale and density (maps are small and feel very barren with not a lot of life). Two of the seven missions are the same map but with alternative paths but its still the same map. Also the game is way too easy. This is partly because enemy density is much less so you never feel overwhelmed nor do you feel you need to be more deliberate with when and where you fire your rifle. But also a lot of the starting areas for mission give you such a strong vantage point you can easily kill 10+ enemies from the very spot you spawn in. In one mission you can kill the main target from the starting area, like what is this? Would only recommend this game if you can score it for $20-25. Everyone says its DLC for S5 and it very much feels that way.",11.7 hrs on record																					(7.3 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198004559773,1,Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2,Action,Recommended,No manual save. You'd think it would autosave after wiping an area of enemies but it doesn't even do that. Not going to waste my time with a game that doesn't respect its players' time.,0.6 hrs on record,N/A
76561198004559773,1,Delta Force,"Action, Adventure, Massively Multiplayer, Free To Play",Recommended,"For some reason, getting revived doesn't remove a death from your record so there is less incentive to wanting to be revived other than not removing a team ticket and if you leave a match early, it marks a death against your record even if you never died as well as every down even if you get revived. This is some brain dead game design that actively discourages revives. It is entirely possible to care about your personal performance and play the objective though the developers seem to think these kinds of people don't matter by actively punishing them by hiding the one stat mid-game they would care about. If people are getting pub-stomped they are going to leave regardless and now you just gave them extra incentive to do so. Update: Since the latest update, every down is considered a death now even if you get revived and never leave the match. So somehow they managed to make your downs feel even worse than they already did. And because it hides your downs/deaths mid-game, you have to wait till the post-match scoreboard to see how badly you did. Great job devs at actively discouraging anyone who cares about how well they did.",42.0 hrs on record,N/A
76561198004559773,1,S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl,"Action, Adventure, RPG",Recommended,The random frame drops to single digits (1-5 fps) every few minutes with 100% GPU utilization is ridiculous. This only started happening after the latest update and I shouldn't be having these kinds of issues with a 9800x3D and 3070ti on medium settings. Actually unplayable.,26.4 hrs on record																					(24.3 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198004559773,1,Call of Duty®,Action,Recommended,"Its fun if you can be content with the game constantly throwing you into matches where your team is losing 10-150 in Hardpoint or 10-60 in TDM. Nothing like losing 10 games in a row because you join 10 games in progress where you have no chance of flipping the odds in your favor. I don't have a problem with SBMM in theory but its supposed to balance the win/loss ratio so you win and lose the same amount of matches. Except in this game you can win 2 matches and then lose 10 matches in a row. Win another 1 or 2 then lose 5-10 more matches. It can make play time a huge waste of time. Also if you crash due to the directx bug that the devs have seemingly never resolved since release, it counts as a loss. The game punishes you for its technical ineptitude so that's fun.",141.0 hrs on record																					(115.8 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198004559773,2,The Ascent - Cyber Heist,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG",Recommended,Was so eager to get this after playing the excellent base game. But boy where to start: Short length and ridiculous difficulty spike at the end. Weapons suddenly become ineffective at the end making the final boss fight needlessly difficult. Also what is up with the last save checkpoint starting you outside of the base instead of in front of the final boss?

Such an annoying and frustrating gameplay component. -Whoever designed the Bastion boss platforming section should never design a game ever. Literally the hardest fight involves platforming while the floor breaks and you get struck by lightning. Thought I was playing an RPG not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Crash Bandicoot. -Team member A.I is absurdly stupid. On Expert expect them to die in Boss fights within the first 30 seconds-1 minute (fastest I've seen them die was after the first boss attack move).

Otherwise, game is fine though its unforgiving to newcomers. Be prepared to do a lot of homework via Youtube and Google because the game doesn't do a good job at explaining the minutia of its many working parts. Also so many crashes due to some error with graphics cards (has nothing to do with outdated drivers, the game will lock up, give an error window about its graphics and then crash). There hasn't been a fix since the game first came out and no ""user remedy"" has alleviated issues which is baffling to me. Imagine farming on a map for research points for 40 minutes only for the game to crash and thus all your work goes to waste.

I can't stop but think how much enjoyed in first game but in this it's just overwhelming. Environment is much more beautiful than first game but now it is also hard to notice what is important (interactable) and what is not. First game's simplicity made it easy to understand what is around them. Especially enemies are easy to blend with environment. Powers became useless because enemies are pretty easy to kill. I just purchased Far Reach and Dark Vision, and I'm killing the whole army for some reason. Outsider is annoying as hell and where he was very mysterious god like creature in first game, now he is just typical exposition giving man constantly cutting your gameplay. And I didn't really like cutscenes and voiced protagonist. It just kills immersion. But of course it is just my opinion. I heard a lot of people liked it. Good for them.
