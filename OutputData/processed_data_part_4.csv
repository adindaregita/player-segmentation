Red dead? NO. FNAF? NO. God of War? NO. Elden Ring? NO. None of these FAKE LOSER GARBAGE GAMES can even hold a CANDLE to the shining star that is Virtual Villagers: A New Hope. For starters, the visuals are perfect. They leave just enough to the interpretation of the viewer while still evoking a nostalgic feeling deep within your soul. The audio is delightful. I often say ""hey"" in the cadence of my villagers in day-to-day life. The lore runs so deep, Dark Souls has NOTHIN on this. I cannot recommend this game enough. It is truly the most perfect idle game EVER. Also, there is no language filter on your villagers names so you can have a bald 9-year-old named ""COSTCO"" or ""WALMART"" and no one bats an eye. Truly ethereal. | Great puzzles to tease your brain along with time and character management. I've played this before it was on Steam, great game overall. | I love this game! I grew up playing Virtual Villagers 3, so this is very nostalgic for me. 
I love the puzzles, the building and survival aspects of this game!"
76561198012450682,11050,Dracula: Origin,14.45,"Adventure, Casual",0,"This game has one good thing going for it: the puzzles are truly excellent. Not too hard, no too easy, some really satisfying. But the rest of the game is all over the place. Voice acting is hit and miss, locations are usually really good, but the story is pretty nonsensical in a lot of respects. It starts off like a simple, detective-esque game, then it becomes very dark very fast (with things like [spoiler] on-screen cannibalism, burning someone alive and watching it decompose in front of you, seeing several dismembered dead bodies, and the aftermath of torture [/spoiler]; it definitely crossed more than a few lines for me), and yet it ends in an almost childish way, with an awful first cutscene for the final confrontation, and a desperate attempt at a cliffhanger for a sequel in a shorter, second cutscene). It also has a very weird mixture of christian lore and lovecraftian lore, which doesn't really make any sense (Lovecraft is all about cosmic horror, the feeling of dread and despair from being insignificant in a vast cosmos with beings far superior and knowledge that our mind couldn't even process; including a somewhat benevolent god who is ""the god"", and including other ""gods"" that are actually just ""demons"", even when being referenced as ""gods"", is nonsensical to say the least).
It definitely left me feeling disappointed more than a few times, and it overstayed its welcome for a few hours at the very least. I can't really recommend it. | I played it a long time ago. I really like it, that's why I bought it. 
Great game."
76561198012450682,3590,Plants vs. Zombies GOTY Edition,10.883333333333333,Strategy,2,"Plants vs. Zombies brings to mind the brilliant designers of the classic arcade games of the early 80's. Designers who, with access to scarily primitive hardware, scant complex controls, and often the singular player-controlled verb of ""move,"" created iconic, immortal and wonderfully fun video games. Plants vs. Zombies is a game played with the mouse, and there are no exceptions made to this premise. There are no hotkeys, or alternate control schemes. It is a game your grandma could play, and I bet she'd like it. Also just like those old arcade games, Plants vs. Zombies, in its genius birthed of simplicity, comes to mind rapidly when considering what games are prime examples of art.

76561198012450682,32360,The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition,17.016666666666666,Adventure,0,"This is barely a positive recommendation.

The original game was great, and it's great that you can switch freely between them, because the remaster has issues. The interface of the original game felt dated when it came out, but worked okay. The remaster tries to update the interface, but with limited success - and in many cases the compromise between what a modern audience expects from an interface and the archaic old interface is downright worse than the old interface. It is often needlessly frustrating to play this game - the fight is with the interface to solve a puzzle you know conceptually how to do, and this is a terrible thing for any game, but especially a point and click adventure game.

It doesn't help that having played the game as a kid, and imagined what the pixelated graphics would look like - the update graphics often don't match my imagination of what the characters should look like.

But - the music is all spot on - as I remember the music rather than how the music actually was - and the voice acting is great. I've only found one or two characters so far that don't sound how I think they should sound.

What I want is to play the old game with the new music and the voice acting - but this will do. | I play this game once every 10 years or so on my best-of rotation. It definitely shows its age with the graphics and animation but mechanically it's very responsive and enjoyable. The story is great, the humor is classic, the music is peak nostalgia for me, and it's fun. | The Secret of Monkey Island is Adventure games at their finest. It's a all-time classic title for a reason. The writing is hilarious, the art and music are charming, and the puzzles are engaging. There isn't much to be said about the original title that hasn't been said already. However, this is the Special Edition, and I intend to review it as its own title.

The TSoM:SE is a very faithful rendition of the original. However, it clearly was designed as a console port more so than anything else. The control scheme is very controller-centric, which can take away from the experience for PC players. Of course, you can always hot-swap to the classic version, but then you miss out on the wonderful voice acting. If only there were a PC-centric control set as well, or even the option to have voice acting on the classic edition. | Remake de un título muy especial para mi, ya que se trata de mi primer videojuego de PC.
Gráficos y sonidos actualizados, dejando atrás los píxeles como puños y sutituyéndolos por gráficos dibujados a mano, pudiendo también escuchar por fin las voces de los protagonistas
Pese a tratarse de un excelente juego, guardando la esencia del original tanto en sus puzles como en su humor, reconozco que las mecánicas se han quedado un tanto obsoletas.
También comentar que ese juego que tantas buenas horas disfruté en mi juventud, apenas me ha durado 3 horas y media
 | Hilarious game with clever puzzles. Totally recommended. If you can beat it without hints then God bows down to you"

76561198012450682,40330,Secret Files: Tunguska,3.566666666666667,Adventure,0,"Ich spiele das Spiel nun nach bestimmt 15 Jahren oder so zum zweiten Mal und wollte ein wenig in Erinnerungen schwelgen, und mich vergewissern, ob das Spiel auch wirklich so gut ist, wie ich es in Erinnerung habe. Und ja, ist es!

Klar, die Grafik ist heute nur noch mittel schön anzusehen, aber das hatte ich auch nach so viel Zeit nicht anders erwartet. 

Das Spiel kann (und sollte) auf jeden Fall in der deutschen Sprachversion gespielt werden (es ist ja auch im Original auf deutsch vertont worden). Es hat sowohl eine spannende, ernste Story (die am Ende vielleicht ein bisschen klischeehaft wird, aber das ist verzeihlich, denke ich), ist sich aber auch nie zu schade für einen Witz, oder eine Anspielung auf (deutsche) Popkultur. Die Sprecherinnen und Sprecher machen eine wirklich gute Arbeit (wobei man bei Nina manchmal das Gefühlt hat, sie ist doch etwas sehr locker und gelassen, bei allem was ihr so widerfährt :D). 

Ein paar Logiklücken hat man natürlich wie immer, vor allem dabei warum jeder auf der Welt, vom vereinsamten Indigenen im Wald, bis zum Pförtner am anderen Ende der Welt akzentfrei und perfekt deutsch spricht (oder soll man stattdessen annehmen, dass das jeweils nur für die Spieler übersetzt ist und Nina und Max dafür sämtliche Sprachen der Weltgeschichte perfekt beherrschen?). Aber naja, alles nur meckern auf hohem Niveau. 

Das Spiel macht Spaß und hat keine völlig absurden Rätsel. Es gibt eine integrierte Rätselhilfe für die Minigames und eine Hotspotanzeige, also alles was man braucht. Vielleicht wird man ein paar Mal einen Guide für die Details prüfen müssen, aber im Prinzip kommt man recht gut mit Logik und Rumprobieren durch. 

Ich kann mich an keine nervigen Sequenzen erinnern, oder irgendwas das mich grob gestört hätte.

Tipp: Auf jeden Fall die (Post)credits Scenes nicht verpassen. | I don't know what to think of this game, it starts off with really easy puzzles, but at some point the solutions become nonsensical. Last 1/3 of the game i was in a cycle of spending an hour to find a solution, then solving one puzzle, then wandering around again for another hour. All in all I manged to solve the game in 16 hours.

I was going to say this game holds up really well being from the turn of the millennium, but was surprised this game was released in 2006. Graphics and menus seem a bit dated for its time.

I guess since the game was good enough that I was motivated to finish it, I will give it a thumbs up. Not nearly as good as the Syberia series, but probably if you are a hardcore PnC fan and looking for something to play, get this at discount. | The story is very interesting, well-made and well-presented.

The puzzles tho.. really 50/50. Many of them make no sense imo and there were atleast 20 places were I would not have been able to progress on my own and only made it because I read a walkthrough.

That is also the reason that I will not play the 2nd game or any other of the 'Secret Files' - games.


I would give it a 6/10 (9/10 for the story). | Sorti en 2006, Secret Files: Tunguska reprend des idées rappelant Indiana Jones et les Aventuriers de l'Arche perdue comme point de départ. Nina Kalenkov découvre le bureau de son père, professeur émérite faisant des recherches dans la région de Tunguska, qui a été saccagé. Avec son ami Max, elle va parcourir le monde pour retrouver sa trace.
L'histoire est intéressante, et cette aventure à la Tintin se parcourt avec grand plaisir. Le jeu fut une très bonne surprise à une époque où le genre du point & click était quasiment mort, et il fait partie, selon moi, des classiques. Je l'ai refait plusieurs fois avec toujours autant de plaisir."

 | The game also comes with a DLC, which includes the following items:

1. A Toxic Community: Mistakes are rarely forgiven. Unless you’re playing with friends, be prepared to face harsh criticism, often from younger players. The game’s multiplayer is largely populated by school-aged players who don’t hold back.


2. Disruptive Adults: It’s not just the kids causing chaos—some adults blast music through their microphones, assuming everyone else shares their taste. Spoiler: they don’t.


3. Frequent AFKs: Teamwork can fall apart when a teammate goes inactive, whether they’re brewing tea, taking a smoke break, or simply wandering off mid-game. And yes, it often happens right after you’ve generously used your first aid kit on them.


4. Team Abandonment: Lone wolves running off to the far corners of the map, only to be overwhelmed by infected, are a common sight. They’re quick to flood the chat with colorful language before rage-quitting the game.


5. Difficulty Disputes: Some players join games on ""Expert"" difficulty only to demand a downgrade. If their request is denied, they might sabotage the team before leaving the server entirely.


6. Vote Kicks: Occasionally, you’ll encounter players who inexplicably start a vote to kick you from the game. When you ask why? Crickets.



The Verdict: Despite the chaotic community, Left 4 Dead 2 remains a phenomenal experience. The graphics are a significant step up from the first game, the mechanics feel more polished, and there’s a greater variety of weapons and infected to enjoy. However, surviving the online experience without a calming remedy might be just as challenging as surviving the zombie apocalypse itself. | [h1]写了800字的推荐文，手欠点了一下""否""全没了。不说了血压高了,头晕。[/h1]总之就是《关于一个萌新GMOD玩久了无聊直接去玩L4D1多人因太菜反复被僵尸虐而被队友抛弃伤心自责卸载游戏过半年好奇进L4D2知道玩单人熟悉官图及玩法过程中发现了能打MOD结果一发不可收拾地搜各种进阶攻略教程提升自己游戏体验和能力努力不坑队友可仍然很菜但是很感谢带萌新入坑的朋友们以及创意工坊的大佬们给这游戏第二次生命的事》 | Крутая игра для игры с друзьями (которые в это не играют)! Есть редкие достижения, куча пушек и толпа зомби, которая будет медленно наступать на пятки и их съедать. В общем, весело, рекомендую. | Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D2), released by Valve in 2009, is the gold standard for cooperative zombie shooters. Featuring intense survival gameplay, smart AI, and an incredible atmosphere, L4D2 delivers an unmatched multiplayer experience. With its fast-paced action, diverse weapons, and unpredictable enemy encounters, this game remains one of the most thrilling and replayable co-op shooters ever made.

Gameplay – Pure, Adrenaline-Fueled Action
L4D2 is all about co-op survival. You and three teammates must fight through hordes of the undead, navigating through various maps and completing objectives to reach safety. The key to survival? Teamwork, strategy, and adaptability.

The gunplay is tight and satisfying, with a wide selection of weapons including assault rifles, shotguns, SMGs, sniper rifles, and melee weapons like axes, katanas, and even frying pans! Every encounter feels dynamic, thanks to the AI Director, which adjusts the difficulty based on your team’s performance, ensuring no two playthroughs are ever the same.

Special Infected – Enemies That Keep You on Edge
Beyond the standard zombie horde, L4D2 introduces Special Infected that force players to work together:

Tank – A massive brute that can throw debris and crush survivors.
Witch – A terrifying enemy that, if startled, can instantly incapacitate a survivor.
Smoker – Uses a long tongue to drag players away from their team.
Hunter – A fast, agile infected that pounces on survivors and pins them down.
Boomer – Explodes in a shower of bile, attracting a massive horde.
Charger – Charges through groups, slamming a survivor into the ground.
Spitter – Creates pools of acid that deal heavy damage.
Each Special Infected forces different team strategies, making communication and positioning absolutely crucial.

Campaigns & Maps – A Horror Movie Experience
L4D2 features multiple campaigns, each set in diverse, apocalyptic locations across the southern U.S.:

Dead Center – A chaotic mall escape reminiscent of classic zombie films.
The Parish – A tense race across New Orleans to reach an evacuation zone.
Swamp Fever – A creepy, foggy swamp filled with infected dangers.
Hard Rain – A unique campaign featuring a devastating hurricane that changes the environment.
Dark Carnival – A fan-favorite, featuring a deadly amusement park with a thrilling rollercoaster finale.
Each campaign feels like a mini zombie movie, packed with cinematic set pieces, interactive environments, and intense finales.

Multiplayer & Game Modes – Endless Replayability
L4D2 offers several game modes that keep the action fresh:

Campaign Mode – Classic co-op survival through story-driven levels.
Versus Mode – One team plays as survivors, while the other controls the Special Infected.
Survival Mode – See how long you can last against endless waves of zombies.
Scavenge Mode – A competitive mode where teams race to collect fuel cans while being hunted.
Mutation Mode – Weekly game modifiers that add fun twists to gameplay.
Thanks to modding support and the Steam Workshop, the community has also created hundreds of custom maps, weapons, and campaigns, making L4D2’s replayability practically infinite.

Graphics & Sound – Immersive and Timeless
Even years after release, L4D2’s atmospheric lighting, detailed environments, and gruesome effects hold up well. Zombies react realistically to gunfire, and the sound design is masterful, with eerie background noises, terrifying growls from Special Infected, and intense musical cues that heighten the suspense.

The voice acting and character interactions bring the survivors to life, making them memorable and adding humor to the chaos.

Why Left 4 Dead 2 is a Must-Play
L4D2 is the perfect blend of action, horror, and co-op gameplay. Whether you’re playing with friends or AI teammates, the intense combat, unpredictable enemy encounters, and endless replayability make every match a thrilling adventure.

🔹 Final Rating: 10/10
Left 4 Dead 2 is a masterpiece of cooperative gaming. If you love zombies, action, and teamwork, this is an absolute must-play that still delivers endless fun and excitement after more than a decade.

76561198012450682,33600,Broken Sword 2 - the Smoking Mirror: Remastered (2010),12.216666666666667,"Adventure, Casual",5,"I didn't play the original of this game, I missed it when it was free. 
I love P&N games especially older ones, but this one I could've gone without playing.

Maybe it's because this version of the game suffers from being a remaster, I wanted to like it but I just don't. Game originally came out in 1997 and they remastered it in 2010. Sometimes the original needs to be left alone.

I played Broken Sword 5 a few years ago as it was gifted to me and I really liked that game, so after that I decided to try to play more in the series.
Unfortunately this game was the second game in the series I tried and I didn't like it. 

I can see why people like this game, but it honestly wasn't for me.

I only finished the game for the achievements.

I had audio issues throughout the game, sometimes the voices were lower, and some of the cut scene videos wound up being really loud. I noticed that the speech would be in one ear, and in another instant it would be in the other.

While playing this game, I just wanted to push through it to get it over with, I played with a walk through to try to just go through the game as fast as possible. 

I decided to check out a bit of game play from the original version and I don't get why they made some of the changes they did. I preferred the way they did the speech (words above their heads) in the original over the way they did the remaster with the HD portraits. The inventory system was done much better too not sure why they changed that.

The game isn't bad, I just didn't enjoy it, I didn't care for the story either. | Saison 2 très captivante ! Bravo Georgie ;) | Pietra miliare del Punto e Clicca.
Parliamo davvero di un gioco, che ha fatto la storia. 
Il doppiaggio, la StoryBoard, le dinamiche, sono davvero incredibili..
Io lo definisco, un Comfort Game. 
Ci gioco e rigioco per piacere e per pura compagnia... <3 | These games are lots of fun! | un gioco che ho ritrovato ! spettacolare sempre"
76561198012450682,33610,Broken Sword 3 - the Sleeping Dragon (2003),25.083333333333332,Adventure,0,"-геймдизайн. классическая квестовая серия скатилась в модный на то время 3д. ошибка.
~сюжет. продолжение детского детектива.
-графика. зря-зря. | First of all, the port is broken. When you start the game it will do that classic old-game thing where it changes your screen resolution, completely messing up your open windows (not the OS).

When you make any settings changes in the game, they don't save for the next time you run the game. 

Instead, what you have to do is go into the Steam folder, go to the game .exe and enter the properties. Navigate over to compatibility, tick the ""Run this program in compatibility mode"" and select ""Windows XP (Service Pack 3)"". Then you have to go to Steam and enter the game's properties in Steam; in “General” you go to Launch Options and type this in ""-w [1920] -h [1080]"" (or whatever your screen resolution is)

FINALLY, the game will launch in the correct resolution, and won't bork up your monitor(s). (You have to do that compatibility mode or else the steam property change won't do anything)

Now that we're finally done with this tedious process JUST to be able to comfortably play the game... you'll have to fix the audio and turn on the subtitles each time you launch the game, but at least this isn't as annoying as fixing your desktop every time you launch the game. If you have a PS1, just run an emulator. Skip the Steam version if you can.

Now, besides that—I really liked the writing. So far, this is my favourite Broken Sword game. Maybe the issue is that I wasn't familiar with the characters in the first game, so I wasn't as invested in what was happening. Therefore like in sequel movies, you already know all the characters, so you only need to enjoy the story instead. The second game... honestly, I don't remember it, it's like a fever dream to me: I remember having played it, and I wrote a review for it... but what happened? Did I enjoy it? Since it didn't leave an impression on me, I assume it wasn't good. 

But THIS! This game, I loved!

Now let me clear some things up. Part of why I loved it is because it has the charm of... objectively being bad. For example, the voice acting isn't that good... Like any time a character needs to exude some actual emotions besides simply chatting, this gives Trolls 2 vibes of ""They're eating her. Then they're gonna eat me. Oh my gooooooood"" And I love them for it! It's so soulful!

The controls are a bit... difficult. They're camera-dependent unless the character moves from one screen to another. So if you press “S” to move towards the camera, and then the character moves to a new scene where they appear on the right side of the screen, as long as you're still holding “S” the character will keep walking in the same continuous line: but from your perspective, they're now walking to the left instead of down. If you release “S” and then press it again, the character will start walking down again, instead of the ""original direction"" if that makes sense? 

Anyway, I'm telling you about the controls because it's important you know about 1 section in this game where the controls WILL mess you up in a time-sensitive section. To make a metaphor to avoid spoilers: Imagine you're playing Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark. You're in the opening scene where you have to run from the rolling boulder. You press ""S"" thinking ""I want Indy to run towards the camera, so I have to press downwards"" But no, Indy runs ""backwards"" towards the boulder. Releasing “S” and pressing it again will make him run towards the camera—the desired direction— but because you moved towards the boulder for a mili-second, it’s enough to make you unable to escape it. I've tested: pressing ""W"", thinking ""Indy is already facing the camera, so maybe pressing the forward key will make him walk towards the camera"" but nope, he walks towards the boulder AS WELL! What you HAVE to do, is tap ""A"", making Indy turn left, THEN ""S"" to make him run towards the camera. That's how you ""solve"" this unintentional puzzle.

Speaking of Puzzles, the hint system is gone, including the 4th game (I don't have a favourable review for that bad boy). So unless you enjoyed solving the Goat puzzle without using Hints in the first game (I spent 3 hours before giving in and checking a Hint) you'll want to have an actual walkthrough guide open just to figure out what the puzzle even is. You'll see a bunch of crates standing about... but... why am I supposed to move them... like what is the destination? There are crates here that I can move, sure... but why do I WANT to move them? Capisce?

Like there was a climbable ledge that I didn't know could be climbed, so I didn't know what the puzzle wanted of me.

Closing remarks: 

Even though I have ALL these complaints: I really enjoyed the game. Despite this game making me mad at times: I loved this game! It's beautiful WITH its flaws!

Also Nico is tastefully hot in this game. | Ja is ganz nett. Kommt überhaupt nicht an die ersten zwei Teile ran. In keinster Weise. Aber viele Dialoge sind lustig.

Parlando del gioco in se', una delle migliori avventure grafiche di sempre senza dubbio, trama molto bella e ambientazioni indimenticabili. CAPOLAVORO | Absoluta obra prima. Parece que foi ontem que joguei no PS1 (idoso feelings) e esta remasterização está à altura de toda a experiência. Tal como Day of the Tentacle, este é um dos pais do gênero Point and Click! | This game depicts the French in perfect accuracy. Incompetent, arrogant, over inflated sense of self worth, and in dire need of American intervention to do anything properly.

Additionally, this game also has the same background as Assassin's Creed. Only difference is that this was written by someone with at least half a brain. | Сложно писать обзоры на величественные проекты, которые оказали огромное влияние на игровую индустрию, так как всегда есть шанс того, что ты что-то не заметишь, что-то упустишь из виду, а что-то и вовсе не поймешь. Сложно еще и по той причине, что к таким вещам стоит относиться всегда объективно, что порою бывает непросто, особенно если ты играл в эти игры будучи ребенком.

Но я, пожалуй, попробую это сделать. Ведь, к счастью, обзор мне придется писать на издание Director’s Cut обладающее массой спорных моментов, из-за которых данная версия ""Сломанного Меча"" воспринимается иначе. И, к сожалению, нельзя сказать, что эти изменения пошли игре на пользу, скорее наоборот, они лишь навредили ей.

Первое, на что вы обратите внимание – это перелопаченные анимационные катсцены. Некоторые из них просто зацензурили, где-то вырезали кровь, как например в ролике, в котором ирландский мальчишка рассказывает Джорджу Стоббарту о том, как киллер сбил на своем автомобиле несчастного Шона. А что-то так и вовсе было изменено. Как например вступительная заставка , с которой и начинается рассказ. Причем нововведения коснулись не только визуальной составляющей, но и монтажа. Во-первых, в некоторые из них добавили комиксойдные раскадровки, из-за которых эти заставки воспринимаются уже не как качественный мультфильм, нарисованный от руки, а как обычная игра. Во-вторых, монтаж был изменен в угоду добавленных сюжетных арок про Николь. И это очень сильно мешает восприятию ибо новый монтаж мешает повествованию, а комиксовые раскадровки перекрывают собою весомую долю экрана. В третьих, в целях цензуры некоторые сцены смерти нашего искателя приключений были вырезаны, как например момент, в котором саркофаг вместе с Стоббартом скидывают с моста в реку

Во-вторых, коли речь зашла про слона в посудной лавке, то нельзя не упомянуть и о нем. А именно о новых эпизодах про Николь. И проблема здесь не столько в самих новых эпизодах, которые по большей части хороши как историей, так и визуалом, сколько в том, как именно они были вплетены в общую канву сюжета. Дело в том, что первоначальный сценарий уже сам по себе был цельной, и в общем-то законченной повестью, которая не нуждалась в каких-то дополнениях. Во-вторых, главным персонажем данного творения является все-таки Джордж, а не Николь, и теперь складывается впечатление, что эта капризная барышня пытается перетянуть одеяло на себя. На пользу новому образу героини это не идет, так как она всего лишь персонаж второго плана, которая попросту поддерживает Джорджа. Делу еще мешает то, что разработчики совершенно не продумали то, как эти эпизоды добавить в сюжет, и когда повествование переключается на Николь, то нам просто на фоне черного текста предлагают посмотреть на то, а что же происходило с ней, в то время как наш авантюрист куролесил по всей Европе. Из-за этого история теперь не ощущается цельной, и это огромный недостаток. Но есть и еще один нюанс, который режет глаз. Дело в том, что оригинальная игра была полностью нарисована от руки, с использованием натуральных красок, что придает сему творению особую эстетику, однако же в новых эпизодах используется уже компьютерная палитра цветов, что лишь лишний раз подчеркивает их инородность. Стоит ли говорить о том, что из-за всего этого большая часть игроков невзлюбила эти изменения. И это печально, ведь если закрыть глаза на эти недостатки, то перед нами будет хорошая история, раскрывающая нам кто именно такая Николь, какие мотивы она преследует, почему она помогает Стоббарту, и что она не просто сидела сложа руки, а действительно помогала главному герою разобраться во всех хитросплетениях тамплиеров.

С этой проблемой разобрались, давайте же поговорим о другом аспекте, который нельзя оставить без внимания. А именно о комиксойдных раскадровках в самой игре. Во время диалогов персонажей в верхних углах экрана нам будут представлены маленькие окошка с лицами персонажей, которые принимают участие в беседе. И все бы хорошо если бы не одно маленькое ""но"". Они абсолютно статичны и лишь изредка меняются. И это не было бы проблемой если бы спрайты самих персонажей стояли с такими же каменными выражениями лиц. Но нет. Лица спрайтов полностью анимированы. Губы у них двигаются, эмоции меняются и персонажи реагируют не только на реплики, но и на то, что происходит вокруг них. Сказать, что от этого возникает ощущение зловещей долины, это не сказать ничего. В довесок к этому у этих комиксоидных вставок палитра цветов отличается от оригинальной, из-за чего они кажутся тут по попросту лишними.

Однако это мелкие недостатки. Есть косяки у этого переиздания и покрупнее. Дело в том, что часть комментариев Джорджа к различным вещам выкинули. А именно они подстегивали игрока исследовать местность, именно они раскрывали характер этого парня, его чувство юмора и способность находить плюсы даже в тех ситуациях, когда его жизнь висит на волоске от смерти. Из-за этого теперь не хочется так сильно изучать мир и возиться с вещами в попытке услышать от него анекдот, который на долго застрянет в твоей голове. Но мало этого, некоторые реплики были попросту переписаны. И в оригинальной игре, Джордж был острым на язык, но теперь он стал излишне саркастичным.

Однако если закрыть глаза на все это, то перед нами все еще хорошая игра, которая сохранила в себе большую часть достоинств. Помимо этого, в дополнение к этому переизданию вы можете бесплатно получить оригинальную игру, которая лишена всех этих недостатков. И именно по этой причине обзор мой положительный. Ознакомиться с режиссёрской версией стоит, но только после того, как вы сыграете в оригинал.
 | Medium-Easy difficult story with puzzles. Nice old adventure game. I love it when I played it twenty years ago."
76561198012450682,46550,Post Mortem,0.9166666666666666,Adventure,0,"This is has to be the worst designed point and click i ever played to this day. Story is your standard B-movie like mystical thriller, nothing special in that regard. VA are atrocious, listening to americans pretending to be french physically hurts. Narrative presentation is... also atrocious. Developers tried to create non linear game and failed hard. Often dialogs make no sense, as character start to blabber about things that did not happened at that moment or protagonist had no clue at that point of time. One of the characters works just like exposition machine. She exists simply to provide exposition dumps to protagonist, dumps that often should not even concerns him at that moment. Existence of such a character in the storyline is the best example of writers impotence.

Than we have puzzles... yeah... and its the worst part of the game, not because of moon logic or something like that, no. Because most of puzzles here are solved by tedious selection method. But thats not all this game from 2002 has... drum roll... A SOFT LOCK! Yep! You thought that by that time developers all over the globe realized that soft locks are bad, but apparently not blokes that created this steaming piece of something.

To the trashbin it goes! Thumb down.

PS: considering potential for soft lock, you may want to restart game... and there will wait an another surprise - unskipable dialogs! Because devs really, really wanted you to listen to their atrocious VA reading their atrocious nonsensical lines written in service of a story about evil wizard."

These games could use an additional bump anyway (and them bloody numbers). Since I'm here, gotta say the first game isn't entirely representative, they only get bigger and better. Doesn't mean you should skip it, still a great adventure. But expect improvements, don't drop the series if Legacy didn't do it for you. I promise you'll get back to it with a new outlook after finishing Epiphany - and by that time you'll be craving more like a hungry spirit. This reminds me of Shadowrun. I didn't even like the first game initially, skipped straight to Dragonfall, then played Hong Kong... then crawled back to the flawed original with a newfound appreciation, embracing it like it's family. | I originally played the Blackwell series 2016, I also didn't play them in the right order... So now I am. 

I adore the series it's one of my favorites and I recommend the series to any of my P&C friends when they ask for recommendations. I highly recommend trying to play the whole series, even if you have to wait for a sale because it can be worth it if the story is your style.
I got hooked on the games, when I would finish one I would go buy more because I got caught in this story and I followed through to the end with no regrets. 
The first doesn't really do the whole series justice, but honestly the more I went on the better the story got all the way to the end.

My first playthrough was about 2h 20m, my second playthrough was about 1h 40m.
This is a very short game, it's very simplistic, and it's easy to beat under 2 hours.

This game is an easy entry into the series but it does have it flaws, it's more of a ""paper and pencil"" detective style and not a ""put a bunch of objects together"" kind of game. 

The game hardcore (like most) relies on you to exhaust dialogue options and some of them are easy to miss but are necessary to do a specific puzzle. -[spoiler]Mainly the talking to Joey about his powers before you try to deal with Kelly to grab what you need from the room.[/spoiler]
Rosa and Joey actually make a good team, especially the more through the series you go, I love them.

I know this won't be for everyone, but I say try to give it a shot, it migh just be worth it. | Really enjoyed this game and gobbled up the whole series shortly after playing this. Nice and challenging with a very cool premise. Love pixel art graphics too. | Pelo preço não há do qie reclamar. É um point and click de mistério curto."
76561198012450682,80340,Blackwell Unbound,10.833333333333334,"Adventure, Indie",3,"Originally played the series 2016 and replaying again in order this time.
Unbound the second game in the series. 
I have a total of 2.5 hours in the game, so first time took me about 1h 20-30m.
I managed to beat the game the second time in 1h 10m.

This one is shorter than the first game, I believe the shortest in the series. It is a prequel.
There's not much else I can say other than it's good for what it is.

I still recommend the series. | Blackwell Unbound is the first game I played from the series and I absolutely LOVED it. | Great game if you're into point and click/advenrture games.
Cool, atmospheric feel to it. Great pixel art style. I really enjoyed it. | I ripped through the whole series pretty quickly and this was a great second instalment. Love the storyline and characters. | This one’s a solid follow-up to [i]The Blackwell Legacy[/i], offering another engaging, atmospheric entry in the series. I really appreciated the way it deepens the lore of the Blackwell universe while maintaining the same moody, ghostly charm that made the first game so compelling. Playing as Lauren Blackwell, a no-nonsense, chain-smoking medium, gives the story a fresh perspective, and her dynamic with Joey is just as entertaining as it was between Rosa and him.

That said, the game is noticeably short, even by indie adventure standards. The puzzles are logical and well-integrated into the story but tend to be on the easier side, making it a fairly brisk experience. While the writing, music, and atmosphere are all top-notch, I couldn’t help but wish there was a little more meat on the bones. Still, it’s a must-play for fans of the series, hopefully setting the stage for what’s to come."

76561198012450682,80360,Blackwell Deception,7.416666666666667,"Adventure, Indie",14,"[quote]I accidentally reviewed the wrong Blackwell, meant to write this under the first one, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/magerama/recommended/80330/]Legacy.[/url] Yeah, a review inside a review that both link to each other, call it Blackwell Inception. But whatever, all of them are great anyway. This one has less reviews, so maybe it's for the best![/quote]
I'm quite an elitist when it comes to point & clicks, but I think that even in the 90's when there was plenty of competition the series would stand out. I'm even inclined to claim that Blackwell would be considered a classic by now. Because it has it all: charismatic characters with believable motivations, clever puzzles with original tools for solving them, and great stories with satisfactory conclusions. Not to mention the games get progressively more beautiful. Although, in terms of looks, my personal favourite is Unbound, a prequel. If I had to be a stickler, I'd say that the voice acting quality is not always consistent and I personally didn't care much for the music, but these aren't even nitpicks, only half-relevant whims. The two main characters, Rosangela the medium and Joey Mallone, a 1920's ghost who guides her, get so thoughtfully fleshed-out throughout the series your relationship with them is going to feel almost intimate. Together you shall investigate dead people's back stories and send their stranded souls to a place where they belong, not necessarily Heaven or Hell. That part remains a bit of a mystery. Not because the writing is obtuse, just subtle.

But what really makes these games stand out is the inventive use of Joey's intangible nature (ghosts are the perfect eaves-droppers, who knew?) and Rosa's notebook for puzzle-solving. Normally in adventure games you can either talk on certain topics or use inventory items to achieve your goals. Here, the notes add another layer of complexity. You can ask characters about the stuff you documented or compare evidence by using your records on environmental hot spots. You'll see what I mean almost instantly if you give Blackwell a chance. I think everyone should. There were no bad games in the series, each one of them is full of heart and soul. I truly enjoyed the whole thing and make my recommendation without a shadow of a doubt. I wish I could be more thorough, however, I played a long time ago. Don't have any notes left. So, these impressions are a residue that stayed with me after many years since I touched Blackwell. Which is probably also telling. The games never left my mind, haunting my ass into writing this. And you don't even have to be interested in the paranormal to love them. I'm not. These are still among the best point-n-clicks ever made. If you're into the genre and you just found this goodness, congratulations. It's your lucky day.

This was probably my least favourite entry in a while in terms of puzzles, but the story is so compelling and the characters so put-together that I hardly care.

    [*][b]Banda sonora que te eriza la piel:[/b] Las actuaciones de voz están llenas de emoción, y la música acompaña perfectamente cada escena, intensificando la desesperación y la tristeza del apocalipsis.

Essa franquia e os personagens são muito especiais para mim e tenho um carinho enorme com a comunidade de jogadores que amam esse jogo.

Praticamente um dos pioneiros dos jogos de escolhas narrativos desse estilo de 'apontar e clicar' (acho que o primeiro foi Heavy Rain), The Walking Dead da Telltale sempre será atemporal com sua narrativa, depois de jogar acho que vai ser difícil esquecer do jogo de zumbi com a menina do boné com um D na estampa chamada Clementine e seu salvador Lee Everett.

Incrível do começo ao fim, bem construído com 4 episódios com inicio, meio e 'continua no próximo episódio' perfeitos para te fazer continuar a jogar, e o quinto episódio te fazendo jogar o segundo jogo.

Como é aquela palavra mesmo? ""Masterpiece""? Com certeza esse jogo é isso!

[b]Geschichte[/b]

Im Hollywood einer alternativen Realität existieren echte Monster, die im Filmgeschäft sind und insbesondere Filmrollen in Horrorfilmen übernehmen.

Wir spielen ein Reporterpärchen, das ein Event für eine harmlose Reportage besucht, dann aber in eine recht abstruse Geschichte hineingerät, die zu verstehen mir leider nicht recht möglich war.

Statt eines klaren Handlungsfadens (der ja meinetwegen Rätsel enthalten darf, die erstmal ungeklärt bleiben) beginnt eine Achterbahnfahrt mit deplantierten Gehirnen, Teleportern und einer Pharaonin, um nur einige markante Sachen zu erwähnen. Ich wurde nicht schlau daraus.

Da half es auch nicht mehr, dass es einen Erzähler gibt, der die Handlung ab und an begleitet und kommentiert, obwohl dies an sich sehr schön gemacht ist.

Der Humor, der immer irgendwo mit schwang war teils nett, teils aber auch ziemlich flach.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3407630251
[b]Gameplay[/b]

Ein typisches Point&Click: Sachen sammeln, zusammensetzen, einfügen, sowie Dialoge duchgehen, die manchmal wichtige Informationen liefern. Die Rätsel waren teils OK, aber es gab auch viele schwere Rätsel. Auf der einfachsten Schwierigkeitsstufe kann man sich auch Hilfe vom Erzähler erbitten, was ich ab un an auch brauchte (es scheint, dass dieses Hilfesystem ein Limit hat, zumindest suggeriert ein abnehmender Ladebalken dies).

Nur nach 2/3 des Spieles bin ich stecken geblieben bei einem Musikrätsel. Ich bin völlig unmusikalisch und dies war leider so angelegt, dass das echt ein Problem darstellt. Da mich bis dahin das Spiel nur so lala gefallen hat, habe ich es da dann sein lassen. Da hätte ich mir gewünscht, ein solches Rätsel überspringen zu dürfen.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3407637170
[b]Technik[/b]

Technisch OK. Das Menü war sogar cool gemacht. Die Grafik fand ich beeindruckend gut, da haben sie hohe Qualität abgeliefert, finde ich.

Der Sound ist auch gut. Die Dialoge sind auf Deutsch und auch so vertont.

Ah, this game. I played it around 2012, I remember loving it, and now, a decade later, found that it is on Steam - and just couldn't resist getting it. And it is still absolutely delightful. 

The best thing this game has going for it is its' characters, Dan Murray and Liz Allaire, [i]especially[/i] Liz Allaire. She's insane in the most charming way. But Dan is amusing too - he's a jerk, but everyone around him still loves him anyway. And these two weirdos - and the overall insanity of the world around - give the game enormous amount of charm and humor.

Puzzle-wise game though the game is decently simple - though in a few times I had to either recall some vague memories of first walkthrough from back then, or just use in-game hint system, though most of the time the problem was in a missed hotspot.

There are a few issues with the game though. Sometimes it can be pretty glitchy - no idea if it's just from attempt to run an 2011 game on 2025 machine, or if it was glitchy from the start. Don't forget to save, so a sudden freeze didn't force you to replay last half of the chapter. Another issue - sometimes the pacing can be off, might be budget cuts or might be a stylistic choice, but a lot of the things are just shown through narration and smash cuts. And my main problem with the game, the main two leads share very little screentime, not enough to develop chemistry - which is weird considering how much the game ships them

But that's just a minor issues in the face of a very fun 7 hour experience | I love Pendulo's graphic style! A nice adventure but unfortunately with some illogical puzzles. | Bizzare adventure full of confusing puzzles (characters themselves sometimes comment on that), all kinds of references (bioshock one was my favourite), funny dialogues and fourth wall breaking. All this sprinkled with good acting and art as per usual and we've got ourselves a fine way to spend evening. | Si c’est avec Runaway que Pendulo Studios a connu le succès à l’international, ceux-ci avaient déjà créé un jeu d’aventure en 1997 intitulé Hollywood Monsters, malheureusement non disponible sur les plateformes actuelles.

Après la conclusion de la saga Runaway, le studio sort en 2011 The Next Big Thing, qui est en réalité Hollywood Monsters 2 (il est d’ailleurs sorti sous ce nom en Espagne).

Visuellement très joli, aussi bien au niveau des cinématiques dignes d'un dessin animé que des phases de jeu, The Next Big Thing met à nouveau en scène un duo homme / femme.

Nos deux héros seront cette fois Liz Allaire : une jeune femme excentrique et un peu maladroite, sujette à des absences soudaines où elle semble perdue dans ses pensées, et Dan Murray : un homme cynique et désabusé, amateur de sport et réfractaire aux intrigues absurdes.

L'histoire se déroule dans un monde dans lequel les monstres existent et sont des stars de cinéma. Liz et Dan sont envoyés en tant que reporters pour couvrir une remise de prix mais Big Albert, un robot géant, a disparu et nos héros vont mener l'enquête.

Comme dans Runaway, nous avons affaire à un duo très attachant et leurs personnalités sont ici bien singulières. L'humour fonctionne bien et donne une motivation supplémentaire à persister face aux énigmes les plus ardues. Le scénario est assez barré et devrait plaire aux fans des point & click de l'époque Lucas Arts.

The Next Big Thing est une très bonne surprise. Le studio a su proposer quelque chose de différent après le succès de la saga Runaway (même si, comme dit plus haut, ils avaient déjà créé cet univers avant). Un très bon représentant du genre !"
76561198012450682,205840,Yesterday,0.0,Adventure,0,"Yesterday was a lot of fun, but it passed too quickly! | 60/100

A decent experience for a thrifty price. This game is a simple point and click adventure with the unusual treat of good attempts at story and characterization. I think the story itself might have been best served as a graphic novel for its linearity and also because it feels a bit incomplete. With gameplay functioning on logic, any off-the-cuff elements that betray the atmosphere of a certain location or puzzle always lead me to think that something was lost in translation, or could have been done a little better. 

On the technical side of things this game lacks polish. It is palpably low budget but decently crafted, with pleasantly drawn scenes and minimal 3d graphics. The music is quite good, but unfortunately does not loop properly. This leads to awkwardly quiet moments as there isn't much in the way of diagetic sound. 
 I was amused and never frustrated. But I was left feeling that a little extra development in the story, characters, and an extra few puzzle locations would make this game classic. You're welcome to try it. | Après le très bon et très drôle The Next Big Thing, Pendulo Studios revient avec ce Yesterday bien plus sombre.

À New York, des sans-abris sont retrouvés morts dans des circonstances mystérieuses, souvent dans des incendies, et tous présentent une étrange cicatrice en forme de Y sur la main. Ces événements passent presque inaperçus jusqu'à ce qu'un duo de philanthropes excentriques, Henry White et son ami Cooper, décide de mener l'enquête.

Pendant ce temps, un homme nommé John Yesterday, amnésique, est embauché pour enquêter sur un mystérieux culte satanique. John porte lui aussi une cicatrice en forme de Y et semble être lié à des événements occultes qu'il ne peut pas expliquer.

Yesterday est un thriller dans lequel le joueur incarne à tour de rôle plusieurs protagonistes. L'ambiance est beaucoup plus sérieuse et plus sombre que dans les précédentes productions du studio et m'a fait penser aux jeux de Lankhor, société française ayant sorti des titres comme La Secte Noire ou Le Manoir de Mortevielle sur Amstrad CPC dans les années 80 et 90.

Les graphismes sont toujours aussi soignés et la DA est assez stylisée. Le scénario, teinté de mystères et de surnaturel, est très efficace même si le jeu est relativement court (6 à 8 h environ si vous êtes un habitué du genre).

Yesterday confirme la capacité du studio à produire de très bons point & click dans des styles différents et sans se répéter. | It has its moments but overall it's too short, random and the further it got less captivating it became.
Art and fast movement is great and made the game less painful to go through, but what it led to wasn't really worth it, at least when it comes to the base endings, as the secret one is fun especially the Torment part.
Most likely the worst Pendulo game | Yesterday is absurd. I feel like I just played someones masterpiece and barely anyone knows what these people achieved. Don't get me wrong, it's still super janky and awkward at times, but this stuff is better than it has any right to be. First however, to keep in theme with the game...

[i] FLASHBACK [/i]

I only vaguely remember how I got to know Pendulo Studios: I was looking at cheap games online and had always had an interest in adventure games. The game Vertigo caught my attention, because of the link with the film, and I looked up the developer on Wikipedia: a Spanish studio called Pendulo Studios. Charmed by their story of humble beginnings and passion for the medium, I made it a goal to try and play all their games (especially since the earlier ones frequently went on sale for less than 1 euro). I started out with their breakout hit Runaway and was convinced I understood their style: janky, weird and absurd stories without any depth but with a lot of heart.

Next I started with the sequel to Runaway, but it felt very similar and I noticed how my energy started to wane. The goal of playing all games by this studio quickly moved to my pile of canceled personal projects.

But during my initial plan I had been a bit enthusiastic: I had also cheaply bought one of their later games... Yesterday. As I have recently been going through an extra intense adventure games phase, I decided to give it a go...
==========

This game has the same jank and weirdness as their previous games. The dialogs are often ridiculous and some scenes don't make sense... But this game also does so many incredibly smart and innovative things I can barely wrap my head around it:
- Super engaging non-linear storytelling
- Incredible use of comic book style imagery during gameplay segments
- Fixes so many annoyances of adventure games: hotspots, hints, quickly fading the character to the target location instead of having them walk all the way...
- An incredibly complex story that actually kind of makes sense and is well constructed
- Puzzles with realistic solutions. One time I didn't believe a solution would work in real life, looked it up online and was even proven wrong!
- Packed with memorable scenes and beautiful environments
- Extremely high pace with zero filler

Runaway I liked [i]because[/i] of the weirdness and the jank.
Yesterday I admire [i]despite[/i] the weirdness and the jank."

There is strange logic and unknown potatos... but rabbit will help you to be a good girl. | An absolute gem of a game and on sale for only $2 right now.

I played this game when it came but forgot most of the story details. AM I GLAD I FORGOT because, my god, this was a delight to experience with new eyes (GEDDIT) for a second time. It touches on a lot of darker subjects like abuse, loneliness, how we as a society treat children, and the trauma that stems from it. It's actually really deep and satirical underneath all the wonky art and jokes. Like the first game, Edna & Harvey both hold a very special place in my heart. | у игры крайне интригующий концепт и интересная история
грустно, что это не совсем продолжение эдны и харви, но действие происходит в той же вселенной и скорее со сдвигом на доктора марселя. интересно было поглядеть как изменилась психушка в 3 главе, но 1 глава, как по мне, потрясающая, и в дальнейшем игра уже не так хороша
управление упростилось, теперь есть всего две кнопки: взаимодействовать и посмотреть. приятно, что появились кнопки, чтобы скипать диалоги и анимации, без них на все достижения было бы совсем тягомотно пройти
достижения в большинстве своём если не сюжетные, то крайне занудные, типа надуй 99 шариков, поговори с персонажем 20 раз, или сделай какую-угодно любую рандомную херню н-ое количество раз, что без esc, крайне утомляет
так еще и игра забагована, что иногда достижения не выдаются, персонажи становятся невидимыми, съезжают слои картинки, так и вообще можно случайно софтлокнуться на вендиго
я взяла за дёшево в бандле, но полную цену за эту игру бы не отдала
вообщем рекомендую с натяжкой, но если вам не понравится первая глава, то дальше играть смысла нет, так как игра лучше не станет, хотя если вам понравилась первая часть эдны и харви, то будет приятное возвращение в психушку в третьей главе. | Had this game for a long time, and can't complain considering I got it I think in a bundle so it wasn't a total waste of money. But just not a fan of the humor, the puzzles did not make sense most of the time-I do like there's a skip button for the minigames because if I ever did decide to play again, I'd skip them, only played them for achievements-and frankly, all the endings weren't that great in my opinion. Some of the humor was funny and I like the art style, but other than that, not the biggest fan. And I was about to pull my hair out over a bug in the chess minigame that is still not fixed."

В чём же прелесть данной игры? За возможность ссать и насаживать котиков на пушки? В этом тоже состоит красота данной игры, но главное... это то, что игра угарает над всем и вся. Над протестантами и их протестами, которые ничего не делают. Мусульманины в лице копий Усама Бен Ладена. Демократичные копы, готовые пристрелить на месте сразу же, и вечно жрущие пончики. Грязные и неотёсанные быдло-реднеки. Сами разработчики, среди которых и сам Винс с Майком Джеем, последний так и вовсе становится мутантом в виде человеко-коровы и финальным боссом игрока. Даже сранные петиции в этой игре высмеиваются, ибо они находятся на том же уровне, что и протестанты, тоже ничего не делают дельного. Игра пропитана чёрной сатирой над каждым человеком в обществе, здесь высмеивают всех и вся, и даже некоторые тёмные события по типу Маунт-Кармела. Фермы, где была секта, состоящая как из взрослых, так и из детей. В 1993-ем году ферму осадило ATF вместе с Нацгвардией и ФБР, и держало 1 месяц и 3 недели. В итоге всё сгорело к чёртовой матери, и погибло 4 агента Бюро, вместе с 82 членами секты. Но к чему я это? Да к тому, что в Postal 2 это событие тут есть! Тут также ферма осажена ATF, также секта, и тоже всё горит. Я не знаю, был ли в новостях у нас Маунт-Кармел, ибо... в 1993-ем в России хватало и своих дел, по типу Чёрного Октября. Не об этом сейчас...

Но всё же, вся серия Postal была создана не для того, чтобы её полюбили. А для того, чтобы позлить мир, в итоге посмеявшись с того, как у людей бомбануло со всего этого.

России и СНГ? Да, во всём СНГ, с игры ржали практически все, и игра свободно продавалась Акеллой, которая позже сделала странное DLC ""Штопор Жжот"" с мемасиками с Udaff, и издавала нормальный Postal III (насчёт него, у меня есть обзор). Скорее всего, всё из-за того, что в СНГ все вот эти Петиции, Зоозащитники, Протесты, Геи и прочие нетрадиционные ценности - просто не чужды жителям СНГ. Да и во время выхода игры, мало кто понимал некоторые приколы игры, ибо, надо шарить за Американцев. Такие вот пирожки. 

Что ж в итоге... мне игра зашла, даже очень. Её кровожадность, её хоть и второсортный, но приятный юмор, её арсенал, и её всё же неплохой ИИ (Да, кривой, косой, но всё же в нём есть и плюсы.

There's no way to skip most of the cutscenes, such as the ones that happen before every single starite mission, or the ones at the start of each new area, or the one after you die...

However, I found the whole thing to be unrelateable, mediocre, and at times uncomfortable. The love interest character, for example, is a fairy, sure, and you could justify her looks as being part of fairy folklore... but you're still playing a game where the love interest of the main character looks like a barely pubescent young girl. It's as if someone stuck a character drawin in anime style into a product done in a rather different style, and it's unintentionally kind of creepy.

First major concern a lot of people have about LOTRO - is it dead?

(Still) No. It still has a very healthy playerbase, big enough that the even the RP servers feel populated. So don't let your worries about population turn you away. The numbers online are not always accurate, so I'd be wary of trusting outside reporting.

This is a classic MMORPG. It's going to be familiar to anyone that has played Everquest, DAoC, WoW, etc. While it means you're not getting any particularly amazing new mechanics, the perk is that LOTRO has figured out how to get the best out of those systems. Leveling feels well-progressed, classes are (mostly) balanced, and there is a lot of variety even within the classes to provide lots of replay value and ways to mitigate strengths and weaknesses.

LOTRO might have the best soundtrack I've ever heard. I recommend turning off battle music and just enjoying the compositions. Bree, as well as the various Inns and Halls located therein, have some fantastic scores attached to them.

Let's be honest though - if you play LOTRO you're probably here because it's Lord of the Rings. And in that regard, you will not be disappointed. The game is steeped in the lore - books and films - and has little nods to it scattered everywhere that are rewarding for someone that is really into their Tolkien scholarship. This is not a LotR skin thrown over a MMORPG framework - this is Middle Earth proper. Even with dated graphics (updates are coming soon, as of this writing) it's still a joy to look at. If you're rolling through some place like the Shire, you'll be able to soak in that sleepy, bucolic atmosphere that the movies portrayed so well.

This is a great MMO experience, and I usually find MMOs tedious. Moreover, it's free - so it's a low-commit to try it out for yourself. | 国服老玩家开服玩到关服，爷的青春，关服后这些年前前后后下了三次美服又被英语和加速器劝退。

Gerade HdR Fans können sich hier Jahre lang vergessen.

Aber!
Es ist nur bis lvl30 F2P, danach Abo oder alles einzelnd kaufen.
Ihr müßt Geld ausgeben, also rechnet euch das vorher gut durch.

Und jetzt kommt das absolut Schlimmste, was für viele zutrifft, bei anderen läuft das Spiel bestens.
Der Client ist derartig beschissen, es ist kaum in Wort zu fassen.
Wenn ihr das Spiel installiert, wird euch auffallen, das erstmal DirectX9 installiert wird.
Richtig. Es ist immer noch der alte Client, wo man einfach über die Jahre alle Erweiterungen und DirectX11 drauf geklatscht hat. Und somit verkommt das Spielen zu einem Glücksspiel, wann und wie es abstürzt. 
Whitescreen, Blackscreen, Bluescreen, gar Greenscreen, natürlich die üblichen Crash to Desktops, Freezes, Lags etc.
Bei mir läuft es jetzt wieder super, aber auch nur auf dem Laptop...

Das Spiel selber ist wirklich old-school und einfach nur perfekt für jeden HdR Fan.
Aber es ist halt auch ne Menge Glück nötig, dass das Spiel läuft."
76561198012450682,206480,Dungeons & Dragons Online®,6.75,"Action, Adventure, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Free To Play",0,"I have been playing this game for years and only recently started playing it through steam. I would say my actual hours are probably closer to 2000. this is a huge, well established MMO with tons of content. if you like customized builds, look no further. you have the ability to create your character from the ground up. you choose where every ability, skill, feat and enhancement point goes, and you can even multiclass. ever wondered how an Archer Monk Wizard would fare in combat? Now you can find out. 

Quests are anything but the repetitive ""find 12 of this"". most quests have you go through intricate dungeons that have puzzle solving and traps and interesting story lines. while the game is less biased to balanced parties than it used to be, you will certainly reap rewards by teaming up with friends or other players although solo play is quite viable. 

The game is nearly infinite in how playable it is. once you reach max level you have a variety of options that allow you to continue improving your character by ""reincarnating"" back to a lower level, different class, etc in exchange for more feats, enhancements and ability points. as I mentioned earlier there is also a massive amount of quests and content to go through, and the devs regularly come out with more.

The game is free to play and I would say it is fairly free to play. expansion packs are the only things you have to purchase with real money (if you want them) other than that all the quest packs and quality of life items can be purchased through in game points that you gain from completing quests. I am very much against the pay to win trend you see in alot of f2p games and even paid games these days however this game is not one of those. if you get serious about the game you probably will put real money into it in order to buy the expansions or pick up some of the adventure packs you don't want to grind for but there are no lootboxes or gambling and everything is reasonably priced. Getting to max level as well as getting good gear is very achievable without paying anything. out of all the games I have spent time on, I would say this has actually been one of the least expensive when I compare how much enjoyment I have gotten out of it over time. If you are into MMOs and like excellent fantasy lore, challenging dungeons, highly customized characters and don't want to spend alot of $$$ for a full gaming experience, I would highly reccomend dungeons and dragons online. | This is one of the old school grouping favored MMOs that well, we just don't see anymore. This is not your World of Warcraft aka: Forever Quest for +Gooder items.  Items are meaningful, the world is huge and its D&D.

Excellent character building. D&D 3.5 is an amazing system.

Pros:
Old School feel
Grouping encouraged and easy
D&D 3.5
Traps matter
Excellent itemization
Excellent character building
Big Huge World with tons of content
Lot's of free content

Cons: 
Graphics a bit dated in some areas
D&D 3.5 can be daunting
The store is not pay to win, but can be costly. | I've played this for years and still have a lot of fun. New expansions and content constantly increase the play and variety. While a lot of content requires purchase or subscription, you can also earn points from playing that will allow you to purchase that same content. Admitedly the totally free route is much more of a grind, so you may find you want to purchase or subscribe for convenience. Overall a beautiful full 3D game, with movement in all directions including high altitudes and deep pits and water you have to swim through. There is day, night, rain, sunshine, multiple moons moving across the sky and beautiful sunsets. And yes, there be dragons too! There are a lot of areas, but you seldom have to run too far as there are telporters and guild ship docks all around to move you quickly to the various regions. Choose the difficulty that makes your play the most fun while still challenging - casual, normal, hard, elite and the new ""reaper"" mode. Many in-game Guilds welcome players - players' ""renown"" build up the guild and your character receives numerous buffs as the guild level increases. A rather unique feature in DDO is the ability to reincarnate. Tired of your current capped build? Have it start again from level 1, but stronger and better each time you reincarnate. While DDO characters only have 30 levels there are 5 sub-levels within each level. Each of these sub-levels or Action Points are roughly equivalent to a level in other MMOs, so it's comparable to 150 levels in other games. There are hundreds of quests to play either on your own, with your friends, with potential new friends, or even purchase an AI hirling to help out. The game starts in the D&D Eberron world, but has expansions to Forgotten Realms and soon Ravenloft. There are also questpacks for D&D modules Against the Slave Lords, Temple of Elemental Evil and Haunted Halls of Eveningstar. Normal quests have up to 6 players and raids have up to 12 players. There are so many ways to customize your character, You can even take multiple classes and try to combine benefits from both. But it's also fairly forgiving and if you make mistakes you can adjust the difficulty, rebuild your character or just wait and reincarnate into a better version. While the game has a lot of features, is very ""learn as you go"" and you don't have to do everything. E.g. Craft it you want or skip it altogether. Most of all I simply enjoy playing and experiencing the various worlds within the game. | Introduction;

I have spent many hours on this game over the years, and even though it may feel a little antiquated now, it is still one of the best RPG's that I have played in a very long time.

It feels like a true RPG, and a true adaptation of the AD&D Rule Set that true AD&D gamers are familiar with.  There is none of that level scaling crap in this game which has become a trend recently.  It is all leveled content.

This is one of the few games which I install every time I have to do a re-install of Steam for what ever reason.


The Game;


The world is huge, to be frank.  AD&D has access to areas of the Forgotten Realms region that, I assume most of us are familiar with, as well as the main city hub of Stormreach, and several huge explorer regions.  For instance, when you get into the Forgotten Realms Campeign setting, you gain access to Evening Star, and eventually gain the keys to the city. If you don't want to be there, then you can go to Stormreach, the Kings Forest, or even the Underdark.

The game has all of the usual enemies which you would associate with the AD&D world, including Dryads, Dire Bears, Kobolds, Druids, and Drow.  The enemies are plentiful, the loot is plentiful, and the traps which can be powerful enough to kill you in one shot, are also plentiful.  

It is a true AD&D game in every way.

The amount of loot that can be acquired from various quests is so expansive that I cannot list them all here, but there is everything from +5 Daggers, to +6 Docents, to +1 Kite Shields, to specific, named loot.  It turly is immense, and the amount of ways to get that loot is even more expansive especially considering the depth of the crafting system, and the wilderness areas which contain specific bosses who can be farmed for fat lewt.  On top of that, farmable item sets of great power can be farmed in Evening Star, simply by farming event tokens in the Kings Forest.  That only takes a few nights to get, and you are essentially fully geared.

The quests are plentiful for both groups, raids and solo players.  The main issue with that however, is that the servers can feel a little empty at the minute, but to help tackle this issue, the game does still receive constant new updates.  Later this year for instance (2017), the development team will be releasing the Ravenloft expansion pack.  Besides which, you can cut the need to do low level content out by purchasing the Shadowfell Conspiracy Expansion Pack and start from level 15 with a heroic class.  Furthermore, a lot of the content does not require a group, so there is nothing stopping you from playing solo, scene as every class has access to certain spell casting and healing items.  With all that said, the game is ageing well, for a 10 year old game.

The highlight of this entire game however, is the level of character customisation.  Every character can be specifically customised in a variety of ways, whether it is through the character generation screen when you first start, or through the epic destiny system, or the tallents trees.  

For instance I play a mage, that might sound boring at first, until you realize that I play a 20th level Eldritch Knight / Pale Master with 7 Epic Levels in Draconic Lineage.  That makes him one bad ass character in both melee and for spell casting.  The range of spells available are not only equal to anything in the original 2nd edition AD&D rule set, but also exceede it, because of these epic level spells and the abilities granted through the tallent trees.


Updates;


As I mentioned earlier, the game is constantly updated, and always in the right direction.  New raids, new quests, new player races are added, and a whole plethora of other things are usually added.  THERE IS NO NERFING which is important to mention, because the trend these days seems to be that if something is deemed too powerful, nerf it and that is usually your update in other games.  That doesn't happen in AD&D DDO.  Instead, we get new raids, new quests, new loot, new hero classes and races, in otherwords, content that we actually ask for.  It is all done right.  

I would highly recommend buying both of the available expansions packs however.  In particular, The Shadowfell Conspiracy DLC is well worth purchasing on F2P accounts.  If you plan to do some F2P gaming on DDO, especially as a solo player, without having to pay a subscription fee, buy that DLC pack before you do anything else.  I will tell you why below.

These are probably my two main gripes against the game.  

I don't like the fact that you may feel like you are forced to buy content packs to get the most out of the game if you don't want to subscribe to DDO, or want to treat DDO as entirely F2P, but you can work around this by buying the expansion packs instead.  

The only times that locked content may be a pain though, is if you are farming for specific loot, and that loot is only available in a certain part of the game world that you do not have access too, or when you may want to do a quest with your friends, and you don't have access to those quests because you haven't unlocked them.

My other gripe is that I really don't like how Spell Points are regenerated via Rest Shrines.  Rest Shrines can be used every 5 minutes, 15 minutes, or once only, depending on the difficulty setting.  This isn't a problem really for classes who don't use spells, but since many of us do, SP management becomes critical, and that is also the chief reason why I chose to play an Eldritch Knight.  Even when my toon runs out of SP, he can still go melee.  The SP elixers should also drop much, much more frequently in game, and I don't think that they should be listed on the store in all honesty.  Selling Spell Point recovery pots may be seen P2W, and may put potential new players off DDO.


Subbing Vs F2P.


don't bother subbing over a long period of time, it is not worth it.  The only real benefit to subbing is the ""free"" DDO store points that you get each month.  

There is a better, cheaper way to unlock most of the games content on F2P accounts, wihtout ever having to pay a subscription fee;

1:  Buy the Shadowfell Conspiracy Pack.  This will unlock a shit load of content and allow you to start from level 15, as a heroic class character.  This will also make a lot of the lower level, locked content worthless.

2:  Buy the Menace of the Underdark Pack.  This will unlock the Forgotten Realms setting as well as the Drow Race and Druid Class, and give you a permanent xp boost for your account.

3:  Use any store points given to buy the ""Hall of Heroes pass"" so that you can transfer between Eberon and Eveningstar without having to fight Lolth on a new toon each time.

Subbing for a year would cost well over $100.  Buying both of the expansion packs and the Hall of Heroes Pass costs around $50 and you will unlock a lot of the base games content.  you then have access to that content forever, without ever having to pay a subscription fee and can start a new toon at level 15, with access to those campeign settings instantly, forever.  


Conclusion.


I can whole heartedly recommend this game at the minute.  I am slightly nervous because news broke recently that the Development Team were teaming up with Daybreak Studios, which is a bad sign in my book, but still, I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, for now simply because I enjoy this game so much.  

IF DAYBREAK do anything to harm the success and longevity of this game, I will never have anything good to say about that business again, and I will probably hate them until the end of my days.

For now, I will continue to actively support this game, and I do plan to buy the Ravenloft Expansion pack later this year, if for no other reason than the goodies it should contain.  Hopefully, aside from the new content, it will include new heroic races, Experince Tomes, and DDO points.  

We shall have to wait and see though, how well this unholy alliance with Daybreak plays out. | In short: 
I strongly recommend this game WITH 2-4 friends in tow. Otherwise, given the current state of the community, I strongly recommend against it!

Note:
Some folks are having problems with becoming a subscriber or purchasing in the market. This is a problem with the Steam launcher. To circumvent, you need to go to your Steam folder ...\steamapps\common\Dungeons and Dragons Online\ and run TurbineLauncher.exe.


The long version:
I had thousands of hours of gameplay prior to acquiring on Steam. I have recently returned to check it out.

DDO, iirc, was the first Western mmo to go f2p-microtransactional. With Daybreak Games acquiring publishing rights recently, it's unclear how bad microtransactions will become. The claim is that DBG won't have undue influence, but this could easily be pushed into the P2W zone.

That said, DDO remains the ""unique"" mmorpg out there. Nuts-and-bolts it was built with grouping, suspense, problem solving, humor, quirkiness and discovery in mind, rather than grind or plain action. In its prime, it had 4 core group roles, with a nod to a fith: tank, healer, dps, trapper and a lil' bit control. The trapper was essential for finding and disarming invisible traps and unlocking key doors.

For newcomers who find a balanced and patient/dungeon-crawl group, the experience is unparalleled. DM narration, complex dungeon/mission mechanics (vs simple boss scripting), puzzles, and slower pacing really do rival your most acute PNP nostalgia.

Like all mmorpg's, however, the dev team has allowed this to degrade into solo'able content, or dps biased grouping. But unlike other mmo's, the original experience is still viable and worthwhile!

The graphics aren't 'modern,' but they have always had an ineffible charm."

A bit grindy on first playthrough but progresses much faster on NG+. I enjoy it despite having played the later CSD games and appreciating their different mechanical approaches to the same dishes and events, and I don't think the three games are truly redundant. The game is written much more seriously overall than the later games as well, though that's saying surprisingly little and ultimately the story is inconsequential here.

Game is soundly assembled and balanced and all the dishes are worth consideration. You will build a lot of keyboard APM playing this game and memorizing combos for further optimizations, though I know of those who prefer joystick controls and are nonetheless quite skilled. 

Everything looks and sounds delicious, and almost inspiring, for drawings and exaggerated sound clips but yeah a lot of recipes get oversimplified. You're going to be cooking entire lasagnas and entire pots of soup for individual patrons. I recommend that you don't buy blue stars until you beat the game. | [i]Cook, Serve, Delicious![/i] in one word: FAAASTERRR

This game is full of keyboard action and plays a lot like those niche typing games. But instead of reading and typing words, you're reading dish orders and inputting corresponding hotkeys at blistering pace and superb accuracy. And yes, you can customize hotkeys for all the dishes, which is pretty sweet. However, there are some notable limitations: the key to serve a dish has to be Enter, and you can only use letters, so [];',. etc. aren't allowed.

Every day that you do well, you get ""buzz"", i.e. the game speeds up. There's no significant bonus related to this other than that you get more customers and earn more money. Most importantly, it makes the game speed fit your skill level. So this is just good game design.

The game also has great humor. If you stay a bit in the intro, you get people saying Cook, Serve, Delicious in every way possible. The e-mails you receive every day are full of character and humor as well.

All that is to say, these developers really know what they're doing, and I look forward to getting 100% for this game! | It's funny going back how much simpler this is than its sequels
Not that that's bad | Very fun and enjoyable typing game, that makes good use of ingenious mechanics to add complexity to an otherwise simple concept. I especially liked how some recipes created a different flow on the keyboard, while presenting unique challenges you had to overcome. 

(I only played on extreme so the experience might be different on normal)

Pros:
- simple and easy to navigate UI (there are some weird menu interactions like how you have to go to the ""View/Buy Foods"" tab to test recipes, but there aren't that many and you get used to it)
- straightforward gameplay that also needs a bit of strategy to play well
- good humor
- music
- diverse and fun recipe cards
- challenging (I wouldn't say it's especially hard but you need to be able to touch type to have a good time)
- not annoying to get all achievements

Cons:
- a few annoying bugs (mostly in the UI)
- becomes repetitive after a while (especially the final star rating)
- difficulty is somewhat inverse if you play on extreme because you don't have any upgrades in the beginning
 - you can't discard a dish to redo it if you failed (its annoying when you miss a perfect day because your hand slipped and added the wrong ingredient in a single soup from like 100+ orders) | A very fun game. It can get a little dull when you have low buzz and consequently very few customers, then the next day you'll be mashing keys like crazy to get through a mad rush.

+ Generally fair but unforgiving difficulty
+ Minimalistic yet effective sound design
+ Clever, immersive TTRPG-inspired interface
+ Infinite replayability thanks randomly-generated playthroughs
+ Built-in editor to create your own custom survivours and adventures
+ Highly-engaging, if not downright addictive gameplay that perfectly encapsulates the tone and atmosphere of George A. Romero's ""Day of the Dead""

CONS
- Only one save slot
- Five survivour limit
- Only three game modes
- Occasional Fallout 1-level interface jank
- ""Zafehouse Diaries"", not a particularly inspired title
- Half-baked relationship mechanic that feels very contrived at times
- Limited micromanagement options (e.g. no way to assign equipment to a specific character)
 | No matter what you do, your people will fight with each other. Really its more like dysfunctional relationship simulator."
76561198012450682,239820,Game Dev Tycoon,44.7,"Casual, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",34,"Went bankrupt when trying to make Concord like Sony. 100% accurate simulator. | Game Dev Tycoon — это симулятор, где вы делаете игры, чтобы делать деньги, чтобы... делать еще больше игр. Сначала вы работаете в гараже, потом — в роскошном офисе, а между этим изобретаете шедевры вроде «симулятора гонок с элементами РПГ».

Игра радует юмором и ностальгией по эпохам игровой индустрии. Но геймплей быстро превращается в рутину: исследуй, разрабатывай, публикуй. Через пару часов начинаешь ощущать себя настоящим разработчиком — уставшим и в отчаянии.

Оценка: 6,5/10 — неплохое развлечение на вечер, но глубины и разнообразия не хватает. Идеально для тех, кто хочет попробовать, каково это — разрабатывать игры (спойлер: сложно). | The game is Okey, but lacks depts.
It would have been fun for the game making process to be deep with a lot of complicated variable.
Instead, it feels very generic, to the point were the optimal solution is akin to a formula.
For example, you try to make military game? Action is a good type choice.
Seek a console that makes good Action type games, and allocate your resource acording to the ACTION type games.
Yes... That's right, all action type games are all basically the same, you just need to find an approriate theme and a good work ratio for Graphics, Gameplay, Dialogues, AI, Audio, etc. FOR ALL ACTION TYPE GAMES.
So what if it's a shooter, a platformer, a music bit-mania type game, everything is the same if it's an action type game...
This makes the game overly simplistic, and frankly, a bit lazy in its design.
You shouldn't put all Action games, Strategy games, RPGs, Simulations games, and Adventure games into the same bucket. Shooters and Platformers are both Action games, but they are very different in their nature, and they are likely appreciated in different platforms.
Btw, PCs in this game are not the best for actions games, but in reality, they are the best for First Person Shooters, but not as good for other action games like platformers fighting games.
TLDR: I didn't like the game because it is a bit too generic, lacks real dept, and doesn't make sense in a real world context. | I remember when this game came out in 2013. 

How did I only get it in 2019?

And play it in 2025?

It's a fun sim game that allows multiple playthroughs to help you get better.

Kinda like a rogue-lite.

Classic game, though. ^^; |

76561198012450682,250320,The Wolf Among Us,12.933333333333334,"Action, Adventure, Casual",30,"Excelente videojuego, una de las historias mas intrigantes e interesantes que esta gente ha traido, basado en los comics de la DC ""Fables"", The Wolf Among Us nos presenta una historia adulta sobre los personajes de las fabulas del año de la rueda traidos a la Nueva York capitalista de hoy en dia, no lo vas a querer soltar hasta que lo termines, en mi opinion, el mejor juego de Telltale. | Really nice episodic mystery RPG. The narrative is interesting, engaging, and well paced. The art style and all the voice acting fit the narrative and themes nicely.  While linear, there's still a fair amount of variation that you can experience throughout the game. I got it on sale for $5 which is totally worth it, but after playing it, I wouldn't really have a problem paying the full $15. It's a great way to spend a weekend. | Last played through this game like a decade ago, it's a masterpiece. Play it if you haven't already.
If you experience issues with stuttering, play in Windowed mode. | Ну что тут можно сказать? Очередная классная история от Telltale | This is a game that truly deserves a sequel, and I’m thrilled that Telltale has made a comeback. Hopefully, they can build on the vision of it.

Overall, The Wolf Among Us remains faithful to the vision of the comics especially in its world-building and character development, TT interwines these aspects masterfully with its signature storytelling style. I can confidently say this is the best game they have ever made. It’s a shame I played it so late. If you’re hesitating to give it a try like I did for some reason, I strongly encourage you to play it.

Unlike Heavy Rain and other point-and-click adventure murder mystery games, this one takes a fresh and unique approach to the genre.

Bigby isn’t just another cliché, drunk, miserable cop. Based on your decisions, you truly feel like an important member of the Fable community and he proves to be more than a competent detective. Rather than simply focusing on unraveling a twist, the game lets you shape the main conflict in ways that have a major impact—not just on Bigby himself, but on the entire city. This is what makes Bigby such a special and compelling character, you can truly feel the weight of his decisions, whether you choose to help others or ruin their lives."

Понравилась рисовка, сюжет, ачивки.

 | This is a standard point and click game. It's older, so it has some issues, but the gameplay itself is pretty solid. My not recommended is primarily because I don't like the characters and I don't feel the need to keep playing. I actually resorted to googling it to see if I was right about what I thought was going to go down and...yep. I'd rather not spend my time getting to that point. | замечательный квест с потрясающим юмором, почти на любое взаимодействие будет какая-то остроумная реплика
по большей части всё вполне логично и до решения вполне можно дойти своими мозгами
достижения приятные, делать их напрягает совсем слегка
вполне себе прошлось на одном духе, без каких-то сильных провисаний, только под конец небольшая духота почувствовалась, что ключ должен быть ТОЛЬКО под последним гномом, так еще ключ и сломается сразу.

Leider bin ich sehr enttäuscht. Ich liebe diese Art von Spiel sehr und ich mag es das man sich kreativ ausleben kann.
Mir wird der Spaß nur leider ausgetrieben wenn mein Charakter ständig einfriert, Dinge verbuggt sind, die funktionieren müssten. (Z.B. eine Waffe erschaffen und als Adjektiv Kryptonisch, sie wird grün und wenn ich sie Superman mit dem Schutzanzug gebe, verschwindet diese einfach. Erstelle ich aber eine Waffe direkt mit dem Adjektiv..was im Endeffekt doch das selbe ist, klappt es. Bei Der Quest hatte ich auch das Problem das ich ständig von Vorne beginnen musste, weil ich dann das Adjektiv ja schon genutzt hatte oder Superman die Waffe hat und nur in die Luft schlug...) Es war auf jeden Fall zum Mäuse melken. Ich hatte oft solche Probleme. 
Ich hatte viel Geduld, aber diese ist leider aufgebracht, für mich wird das Spiel als ,,nicht Spielbar'' gekennzeichnet und weggelegt. Ich hoffe für alle anderen das ihr nicht so Probleme habt. | Scribblenauts Unlimited is not just a game for me. it's a creative learning tool. I introduced this game to my sister and to my child as a way to make learning English early, engaging, and fun. It has its unique gameplay mechanics that allows players to type in almost any word and watch it come to life in a charming cartoon world.

My sister like it but my boy love it and still play it till 8 years old. He finish the game many times. 
I am really thankful to this game. This game really made learning english fun for many child with english as second language. | Pros:
+ Gameplay is fun
+ Lots of DC Comics Characters to choose from
+ Performance is great and visuals are slick
+ Ambitious Soundtrack
+ A great amount of maps to play on
+ Many Objects and Adjectives to use from Maxwell's Notebook

Cons:
- Some Story Missions are confusing | Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure is the ultimate geek crossover, blending the chaos of Maxwell’s magical notebook with the sprawling, lore-rich universe of DC Comics. As a hardcore DC fan and collector, this game feels like an all-you-can-eat buffet of Easter eggs, obscure characters, and deep cuts from the comics. Want to summon Ambush Bug? Go for it. Feel like pitting Anti-Monitor against Mogo the Living Planet? The game has you covered. It’s not just a game—it’s a celebration of everything DC, lovingly rendered in charming, blocky graphics. It even manages to sneak in a little education for kids (and some adults), teaching them English vocabulary while they accidentally learn the difference between Pre-Crisis Superman and Post-Crisis Superman. Genius, really.

For die-hard DC fans, the sheer depth of the character roster is both mind-blowing and a badge of geekdom. The game isn’t just about Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman (though they’re here in spades); it also includes Nth Metal, Starro, and, yes, even Kite Man. Hell yeah! It’s the perfect sandbox to explore the DC Universe in hilarious and unexpected ways. Watching Mr. Mxyzptlk summon chaos or solving puzzles with Alfred Pennyworth wielding a giant wrench never gets old. And for younger players, it’s a crash course in DC mythology wrapped in fun, creative problem-solving. For us seasoned fans? It’s a gleeful tribute to the stories and characters we’ve obsessed over for years. Scribblenauts Unmasked isn’t just a game; it’s a geek’s dream come true. | Just some good wholesome clean fun."

You make your way through a secret research complex, that is more detailed and interesting than the mines in Overture. The combat system is completely removed, which is probably for the best.

Story is much more engaging and has some interesting twists. The only thing I didn't like was a couple of cheesy jumpscares (like body falling in front of you out of nowhere...) and some small visual glitches in the last chapter. Other than that, I had fun from start to the end.

Black Plague shows that the developers recognised the issues of the first game and tried to improve on them while keeping the good things intact. Definitely recommended if you like the original. | ""Black Plague"" is a continuation of the first ""Overture"" game of Penumbra. Continue your journey through the mines deep under the snowy land of Greenland and reveal its dark and terrifying secrets what's burred in there. Have you got enough of the spirit to survive? | Massive improvement over Overture, featuring almost zero direct combat! A direct sequel to the aformentioned game. Story is, as always, amazing while everything else is alright at most.
Also: I have no idea how the laser disarm minigame works, randomly hitting buttons seems to work but I don't think it's the inteded solution.


Bonus - Penumbra: Requiem review.
I wouldn't recommend playing requiem unless you really like puzzles, like, REALLY like puzzles. It does not add much, if anything, to the story. Also, Requiem is not scary, as in, it doesn't try to be. So if you expect it to be another stealth oriented horror game with puzzles like the previous titles, don't. | A perfect sequel that addressed the shortcomings of Overture and exceeded my expectations."

The atmosphere is little bit ruined by the fact that the levels have no logical connection to each other and the it all feels like a series of random puzzle levels. Also, the first person platforming sucks.

If it weren't for the story, I probably wouldn't recommend it. | Only play if you want to know more of the story and what happened to Philip, otherwise it's just a Portal game lacking all the survival elements of the previous games. | Weakest game in the trilogy. Repetitive puzzles, and very little storytelling. A twist ending makes it worthwhile, though. I finished it in under 3 hours. Play this if you're desperate for more Penumbra, but don't expect much. | Игра которая не нужна и вобще не понятно зачем была выпущена и разработана.
Не идет ни в какое сравнение с первыми двумя частями, Реквием - это просто набор душных головоломок в котором мы каждый уровень ищем МИКРОФОНЫ попутно нам выдают комментарий, которые пришиты белыми нитками к игре.
Хоррорной части -больше нет, атмосферы больше нет, сюжета больше нет, просто набор уровней.

Если играете в серию, просто закончите на второй игре в этой части НЕТ никакого продвижения по сюжету, все что есть это бэд трип на подобие ластовых лок во второй части.
 | It's taking a different turn from the previous games.
There's no more survival horror, story progression is completely lacking. It's more like an epiloque that wraps up everything from the previous games, rather than a sequel.
This game invested a lot more in puzzles, which are actually creative and challenging, but it wasn't what I was expecting from a Penumbra game."

""Death is the final unknown"". Yes? | 1. şahıs bakış açısıyla gizem gerilim oyunu , oyun kendini merak ettiriyor eski bir oyun olmasına rağmen oynanış güzel keyifli oyun | Only worth it for the story. Combat is clunky and tedious.

Cool to see where Amnesia series got all its genes from. | Its a very fun horror puzzle game, you can unlock the frame-rate and enable higher resolution by doing some very simple config file adjustments. overall worth the 4-6 hours it'll take you! | Short horror experience, maybe 4 or 5 hours, but very solid. Distinct from Amnesia, in this game you are trapped in a dark, narrow mine with various creatures trying to kill you. There's an interesting mystery hinted at and some almost immersive-sim level environmental interactions. [spoiler] I boiled a dog alive with a steam valve [/spoiler]

I appreciate that in this game the protagonist can fight back and even kill enemies, but the combat is so incredibly clunky that it only works as a last resort. It's particularly risky on hard when you die in 2 or 3 hits and believe me, the enemies know the penumbra overture combat meta lmao. 

My only complaint is that some of the puzzles are very obnoxious. This game has a couple metroid moments where the solution is specific and very easy to miss the hints of it if there are any hints at all. I remember one time I was stuck and I hit a door with the pickaxe out of frustration, and the door came off its hinges - that was the solution to the puzzle - hitting a metal door with my weapon.

psychologically, you, and other people are the worst things on this planet.

while the book does a good job of conjuring up a sentient artificial intelligence hell bent on hate, torture, and zealous control
the game itself allows that aspect to take a backseat, allowing the player to conceptualize a standard of morality
by discovering each plot through the adventures you begin to depict that not everyone here on this earth was of a sound mind

quite tonally set during the cold war era paranoia and skeptical espionage of its era, the 1960s highlighted some serious political debates and contesting the long standing grudges of different worldly opinions


my first playthrough i attempted, succesfully, the good ending finale requiring the characters to make choices and actions that were not going to get them negative karma, or killed

the characters, voices, and artistic visual scenes are all very well done with SVGA 640x480 256 color graphics
the game manual quite plainly explains that the author himself, harlan ellison, voices the AM, and was involved in storyboarding process and reviewing the new script for the game.
i agree with the author that not every playable game should have a ""win"" and literature as an artistic medium should allow someone to create a failed state even when adapted to an interactive fiction
you are allowed to have a dissatisfied bad taste after realizing all your efforts were for not

while playing the scummvm port (v2.0.0) i was more frustrated with minor nuances that dont seem to be ported correctly or ""buggy"" at best lets say.  while i have not played the original dos/win3x dosbox version to compare, which may have also been a buggy mess.
there are times a cutscene plays but flips out, stops playing, or displays something else on the scene OR flat out doesnt appear to play (observing the eyes) maybe there is more i missed
music (midi) seems to suddenly stop entirely, maybe cued by some interaction or just decides for itself to be done playing music.  until a scripted action occurs or you load a save.  these could be original errors or the ""early"" scummvm port itself
at this point i am wondering if the latest scummvm has any fixes, it doesnt appear that something was announced officially for patches to the game engine...

i would say im not done with the game, i intend to explore the ""differences"" through dosbox, and possibly revisit the different possible endings.  as well as import the game files into a more recent version of scummvm and test if it is also broken in some respects.


the release date appears wrong on most sites, perhaps not indicating it was originally released first in 1995 (october 31 1995)
and, let me say, releasing a game on halloween has a very significant intent

* [b]GNU/Linux[/b] | A masterpiece, AM is one of the most evil villains in history, and this version of the story is simply amazing with how many branching paths and different things to explore there are. Harlan Ellison said himself in an interview that despite not considering himself a ""gamer"" he would love to see more games embrace that style of narrative where the player is challenged with ethical choices and i'm glad that in a certain way his desire was fulfilled throughout the years with so many amazing games that followed after this 1995 gem. This is amazing for its time and it still holds up as an incredible Point and Click game. Play it if you like great storytelling and puzzle solving. If you're not that into puzzle solving just use a guide and enjoy the story, it's 100% worth it. Plus, AM, the villain, is voiced by the book's author, Harlan Ellison himself, and he made a stellar job on it. No one better to see the vision than the author himself. Please do yourself a favor and play through this game at least once in your life. | Im sure the story is great and if thats the case I will just go read the book cause this shit boring as hell, its not fun to just click on every possible combination until you magically figure it out. And god forbid you make a wrong decision because then you have to fucking start over whatever character's story you are playing."
76561198012450682,221910,The Stanley Parable,1.0333333333333334,"Adventure, Indie",2,"Great fun - until you try to get the Commitment achievement. Still, a positive experience! :D

Of course, you need to take it easy and not take any of the narrator's comments personally, as the game constantly makes fun of you. And I guess that’s why everyone loves it - ignoring the narrator’s words and having fun messing with each other. Sometimes, it’s crazy how well the scripting is done, allowing you to make different choices and still receive a unique response. This isn’t your typical walking simulator, especially with cool achievements like keeping the game on for an entire Tuesday (yes, 24 hours straight...) or not playing for five years and then coming back.

 | Great narrator, excellent narrative weirdness, and a repetitive loop make this actually a lot of fun to just keep running around inside. | This is an interesting game. There's a narrator that tells the entire story. You have two choices; obey the narrator and follow the story, or disobey the narrator and create your own story. There are several endings you can choose from, and everything you do affects the story in a different way. Overall, this game has unique gameplay that's different than other games. | The narration/Narrator absolutely makes this game 

You'll spend the game going against the narrator, just so you can hear what he'll say about it.
For a game which is literally just walking around listening to a guy talk, its surprisingly engaging and amusing

76561198012450682,261030,The Walking Dead: Season Two,35.18333333333333,Adventure,40,"Вторая часть оказалась куда лучше и интереснее первой, но без минусов в сюжетных моментах тоже не обошлось. Здесь я и правда сопереживала персонажам и мне хотелось поскорей узнать что будет дальше. И очевидно, что вся серия берет именно эмоциями, в первую очередь, потом уже сюжетом. Довольно хорошо, хоть и не идеал жанра. 9/10 | The Walking Dead: Season 2 is a fantastic follow-up to the first game, with Clementine stepping up as the main character. It’s incredible to see her grow and survive in such a harsh world, and playing as her makes every choice feel even heavier.

The new cast of characters has its ups and downs, not all of them hit as hard as the original group but there are plenty of moments that make you care about them. And just like the first game, nobody is safe, so the tension is always there. You never know who’s going to stick around or what your choices will lead to.

The story is emotional and brutal, just like you'd expect, with some seriously tough decisions. It also looks a bit better than Season 1, but what really stands out is the atmosphere. The bleak world feels even heavier now, and every little choice feels like it’s life or death.

If you liked the first game, this is definitely worth playing. It might not have the same emotional punch as meeting Lee and Clem for the first time, but it’s still an awesome, heartbreaking ride. By the end, you’ll probably feel drained but in a good way | Que temporada! A segunda temporada de The Walking Dead: Telltale Series complementa a primeira de forma brilhante, ainda que não alcance a mesma perfeição em alguns aspectos. Ainda assim, é inegável que se trata de uma obra-prima e, mais uma vez, digna de carregar o peso e a essência do nome The Walking Dead.

A narrativa é envolvente, me prendendo do início ao fim, capítulo por capítulo, sem conseguir parar. A Telltale mais uma vez entrega uma história rica em escolhas emocionantes e muitas vezes difíceis, que se mostram inevitáveis dentro do universo sombrio e cruel da franquia. Essas decisões não só testam a moralidade do jogador, mas também evidenciam o quanto a sobrevivência em um cenário apocalíptico é um verdadeiro fardo emocional.

O roteiro é intenso, os personagens continuam bem desenvolvidos e as reviravoltas mantêm o mesmo impacto devastador que se espera de uma boa história de The Walking Dead. Mesmo com algumas imperfeições, a temporada é uma experiência marcante que prova, mais uma vez, o talento da Telltale em criar narrativas interativas capazes de mexer profundamente com o jogador. | I really like this game, 2nd best game of the series 8/10
I dont have much to say because the choices you'll have in the ending are both sad and full of uncertainty | Though not as good as the first game, The Walking Dead Season Two is still a very good story about the bleakness of life during a zombie apocalypse. You pick up slightly where you left off in the first game with the story molding to how you played or choices you made in the first game, which is a freaking cool thing. 
Without spoiling the story, you're going to have a lot more emotional lows playing this one. but hey that's realistic.

A arte do jogo é linda, as mecânicas de card game são fantásticas, é um cardgame baseado em combo no maior estilo can-can. È um jogo competitivo porém a maior crítica que tenho é que não dá pra jogar online nem local, e considerando que a mídia física dele [o card game original] flopou, é quase impossivel achar pra comprar e jogar.

A trilha é ""ok"" e os efeitos sonoros são realmente bons.

Ainda sim fica minha recomendação porque é um ótimo jogo cardgame casual | learn as you go, expanding options makes each round a bit different | Enjoying it a lot since it has huge random and relatively radical skills. Also a notable ""one more turn"" example. Simple, fast, not punishing, not demanding.

Playable with mouse only, so can be played fine from phone + steam link, and works fine with native touch screens too. | Ein gutes  und strategisches Kartenspiel zu einem guten Preis. | Great fun!"
76561198012450682,262900,Smooth Operators,1.9166666666666667,"Casual, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",18,"$2.99? I bought this game not expecting much from it. And now it's 2am in the morning. Low price for hours of fun, where a pizza costs more and lasts 5 minutes? I recommend this game for people that enjoy tower simulation games :) very well made. | At the moment I'm some 5.5 hours into the game. Turns out it's not really a ""simulation"" nor a ""strategy"" game (as implied by the Steam tags) but a ""click-and-wait"" game. Luckily I got it at a decent discount. 

The premise is promising and could make for a very interesting game. Thus it's a real shame it's almost not a game at all. Your business runs on its own and you just have to keep adding new rooms and people when you have the money -- and usually you don't have the money, so most of your time is spent waiting for money to accumulate. There's also not much to stop the money from accumulating, except for the random message dialogs that randomly pop up and require you to click ""OK"". The game is literally unable to advance a single in-game day without you being present clicking something. Forget about SimCity and the like where you could leave the game to run for an hour and come back. This game runs a minute or two and after that it need you to click a button.

Building a new room into your call center costs $3000 or more. At least in the beginning (for the first couple of hours) you won't make more than a few hundred dollars a day, so you wait. And wait. And wait. Occasionally someone quits and you need to replace him or her, and that of course takes away from the small pile of money you had accumulated.

Upgrading rooms costs $5000 or more, so your money seems much more well spent just adding rooms than upgrading them. Or at least I think so. The game lacks proper statistics so it's difficult to get an overview of your situation. Sure, you can read the thoughts of all of your employees and you can see a list of your clients (up to a whopping number of two (2) within my first 5.5 hours, or two in-game months), and you can click on all of your rooms and get to know some stats about them. But there's no list of rooms, or heat maps of any kind. There is a list of employees, but it appears that you cannot sort it, and the filter system (for choosing which types of employees you want to see) is really clumsy, requiring multiple clicks on a different screen from the actual list! So while you can get the details of a detail, there's no real big picture available.

Talking about your employees, you can hire different kind of people: inbound (IB) agents to receive calls, outbound (OB) agents to make calls, managers, janitors, etc. The different professions are very stereotypical. They might've been true in the 1960s or funny in the 1990s, but seriously, it's 2016 now. When a manager's work description is ""putting fear in the agents"" and you see him running around and shouting at people, I don't even. Similarly, a ""Coach"" turned out to be a cheerleader girl waving pom-poms. Seriously?? 

You can also educate your employees (just a click of a button and ta-dah, they are instantly smarter!). The education levels are very sketchy too, like a manager learning a class ""Management By Fear"" or another person learning ""Lying 101"".

Yet another profession is the Project Manager. They unlock new things for you to do. However, you cannot decide what, so most of the time they unlock the possibility of building an even taller building (10 floors, 15 floors, ..., 50 floors, ...) when your building is still less than 5 floors tall and you'd much rather have, say, some better education levels or some new room types. (Not that it'd matter, you wouldn't have the money to buy those things anyway, until after waiting for quite some time.)

All in all this game seems to waste its potential really badly. It's not a game that you play intensively, but a game that you put into the background or on your second screen while facebooking or something, and just check out occasionally to click ""OK"" on that dialog. I believe I'll still give this game a chance for a couple of more hours to see if the money would start pouring in a little faster and if that would make it funnier, but I have my doubts. | Cost of Game/Time Spent Playing easily makes this one of the best deals you will find on Steam. I've had a lot of fun experimenting with different layouts and mixes of employees. If you like tower builders or business simulators, it's a fun light hearted game that will keep you challenged the whole way through. How high can you build before the nearly unescapable death spiral brings you crashing back down? Easy to pause and save at pretty much any point in the game, which is great for someone like myself who usually plays turn based strategy games or slower city building games.

Computer techs kicking computers until they start working again is quite possibly the best example of IT work I've ever seen in a video game. Watching managers storm around freaking out for no reason will make any call center, retail, or food service worker feel right at home.

This is one of those ones you buy that make you angry you spent $60 on some AAA title you got bored of in 20 minutes. | + Casual fun
+ Plenty to unlock and play with
+ Addictive

+/- Controls don't always make sense, lots of misclicking/unintuitive clicking
+/- Time ocassionally moves too slowly (even on the fastest speed)
+/- Stuff can cost a lot of money

- Unlocking things takes too much time
- Too much micromanaging 10> virtual days into the game
- I couldn't find a way to generate any more money once you get less and less income (mainly because of people quiting because their PC is broken (among other things) and IT guys quiting because they can't keep up = endless loop)

[Rating: 75/100] | If you have ever worked in a call center, this game may bring back those horrible memories (especially if you were a supervisor and had to deal with those awful productivity reports LOL), but this is a fun and unique building game in the same vein as SimTower.  You have to make sure you have enough agents to answer the call volumes of the contracts you choose to accept and you must keep those agents happy and productive.

PROS
+ Fun balancing multiple agent types and IT Support, Housekeeping, and building amenities
+ Lots of things to build and upgrade
+ Realistic sound effects that make you feel like you're back in the call center
+ Cartoony but attractive graphics

CONS
- Low income per call means slow pace of building upgrades
- Satisfying contracts AND your staff can be tough"
76561198012450682,262940,Broken Sword 5 - the Serpent's Curse,31.283333333333335,Adventure,21,"Ein schönes Spiel wie in der Vergangenheit :) Wer die alten Adventure mag, kann hier nichts falsch mach | Broken Sword es una saga bastante consagrada dentro de la industria, un nombre pesado que significa mucho para las aventuras gráficas y cuya calidad global es indiscutible. Sin embargo, también es innegable que su evolución no ha sido la más afortunada, por lo que esta quinta entrega tenía la gran responsabilidad de devolverle la gloria al nombre de la saga que porta, y su resultado final no pudo haber sido más placentero incluso con sus fallitos.

Una vez más, el intrépido George Stobbart y la astuta Nicole Collard serán los protagonistas de esta nueva aventura, alejándose del experimento que hizo la cuarta entrega en poner a un desaprovechado tercer protagonista que comprometía la integridad del dúo principal. Como viene siendo costumbre en la saga, la trama arrancará con los protagonistas viéndose envueltos en contra de su voluntad en todo un complot a nivel mundial, mezclando ficción y realidad creativamente y esta vez girando en torno al misterio de “La Maldición de la Serpiente”, como bien hace referencia el título.

Uno de los puntos más fuertes de Broken Sword 5, así como del resto de entregas, es que su esencia se mantiene intacta a través de su estilo tan característico a la hora de desarrollar lenta e inexorablemente su trama, sabiendo manejar de forma notable su comedia hilarante con sus momentos más serios, destacando en que la química entre George y Nicole se siente tal y como en la primera entrega, resultando familiares y añejos desde el principio hasta el final. Además de ellos, “The Serpent's Curse” trae de vuelta a viejos conocidos a lo largo de la pentalogía, personajes que bien han podido pasar uno o varios juegos de ausencia total, y sin embargo verlos aquí reunidos manteniendo su personalidad intacta, además de darles un papel a cumplir para con la trama, resulta en un ejemplo de fanservice bien realizado. Y es que haber recuperado su estilo 2D aun conservando efectos en 3D, luciendo unos paisajes hermosos y recreando otros ya conocidos, así como haber recuperado al compositor de los dos primeros juegos hacen sentir a esta quinta entrega más en sintonía con sus orígenes que “The Sleeping Dragon” y “The Angel of Death”.

No obstante, esto acarrea también un problema que tiene no esta entrega en concreto, sino la saga a nivel general, y es una carencia de retroalimentación entre sus tramas. Poniéndonos en contexto, mientras que los Broken Sword 1, 3 y 4 conformaban una especie de trilogía al seguir todos la trama de los templarios, el 2 y el 5 tiran más por contar una narrativa propia, con puntuales referencias a momentos vividos con anterioridad, aunque sintiéndose una cierta desconexión a lo largo de la pentalogía que da la sensación de que cada título se queda en su propia burbuja en vez de formar todos en comunión una narrativa más global y cohesionada.

El motivo por el cual esto llama tanto la atención se comprende mejor al analizar al dúo protagónico; tanto Nicole como George han tenido una evolución nula a lo largo de la saga, quedando cualquier vestigio dentro de cada juego pero reiniciándose sus personalidades con el pasar de las entregas, lo cual acarrea el riesgo de hacerlos parecer planos y estancados en sus pocos rasgos distintivos. Cada título hace referencia a lo que le interesa, ignorando detalles bastante importantes como todo el asunto de George volviéndose un héroe al final del 3, o Nicole al evitar que el mal se esparciera en “The Smoking Mirror”. Y es que ver a estos dos, que ya han pasado por muchas aventuras destapando en más de una ocasión conspiraciones secretas de índole mundial, e incluso enfrentándose a criaturas de fantasía como un dragón malévolo o el espíritu de un demonio, verlos ahora reaccionar con tanta incredulidad ante el misterio de la quinta entrega cuando deberían estar ya sobradamente curtidos en esta clase de situaciones, se siente como un enorme paso atrás en todo sentido.

De todas formas, a pesar de este problema que la saga lleva arrastrando desde su segunda entrega, la trama sigue siendo tan entretenida e intrigante como de costumbre, lo que evita que resulte aburrida. No llega a resultar tan bien escrita y memorable como el primer juego ni alcanza el nivel de epicidad del tercero, pero definitivamente supera al cuarto e incluso ligeramente al segundo, siendo de las historias más interesantes de la franquicia.

Y sacando músculo en lo que esta saga siempre ha sabido hacer bien, los puzzles relucen más que nunca en la quinta entrega, posicionándose como una de las de mayor calidad en ese sentido. Es cierto que la joya de la corona la ostenta el 4 a pesar de su flojísima trama, dejando al 1 como el más equilibrado mientras que el 2 quedaría un poco por debajo y el 3 en el más fácil. El 5 sabe recoger un poco de todo lo bueno de cada entrega, siendo así el más variado en el tema de sus rompecabezas, sin llegar al nivel altísimo del 4 aunque no quedándose lejos, y resultando en una aventura gráfica muy desafiante y gratificante de superar.

A modo de contenido extra, el juego también ofrece un par de detalles interesantes: el famoso sistema de pistas incluido en las versiones remasterizadas de los dos primeros juegos, y una galería de personajes que relata su biografía junto a un modelado de los mismos. Ambos elementos son muy llamativos, pero lastimosamente terminan siendo más un lastre y una decepción respectivamente que algo positivo. El sistema de pistas, totalmente opcional, sigue sufriendo del mismo fallo de diseño en el cual si estamos en una habitación con distintas tareas, dependiendo del orden en que interactuemos con ellas, las pistas para un determinado puzzle pueden solaparse con el de otro, haciendo que este sistema resulte inútil en ocasiones al no poder retroceder si nos hemos adelantado, lo cual es muy común. Además, dicha galería, aunque es un elemento novedoso e interesante, está desaprovechada; diese la sensación de que fue incluida al principio del desarrollo pero se cortó a la mitad, de lo contrario no tendría explicación que personajes terciarios, cuya participación e importancia es mínima, aparezcan en la galería mientras que otros personajes mucho más importantes que se introducen a posteriori en la trama no se les den su correspondiente espacio, acabando con ser una idea a medio desarrollar y dejada sin propósito.

Pareciera ser que Revolution buscó con creces revitalizar el nombre de la saga con esta quinta entrega mucho más reminiscente a las dos primeras sin dejar de aprender del camino recorrido por los dos denostados títulos anteriores, y lo logró con creces. Es un juego bastante sólido tanto en lo técnico como, especialmente, en sus rompecabezas. Si bien su problema de cohesión narrativa con el resto de los juegos persiste y no parece que vaya a cambiar nunca, además de reducir a sus dos protagonistas a meros maniquíes sin desarrollo, su narrativa sigue siendo intrigante y tiene todos los elementos intactos que hacen tan reconocible a Broken Sword. Es una quinta entrega que vuelve a subir el listón de la franquicia por todo lo alto y una aventura tan entretenida como desafiante, de modo que sólo queda esperar a ver cómo harán los chicos de Revolution para mantener a flote su IP más preciada en el futuro. | mamma mia questo gioco!!! sono una divoratrice di avventure grafiche ma sono molto schizzinosa, e mi piace solo roba di alta qualità... questo come moltissimi altri giochi vecchi che sono poi tornati in voga è più di un gioco.. è come stare in famiglia... non smetterei mai di giocare a giochi così belli, la grafica è eccezionale, la caratterizzazione dei personaggi fantastica e divertente, l'ho adorato dall'inizio alla fine.... vi prego fatene ancora! | I haven't given up this game yet but I think I am close to it. So far the things I have to do to progress in the game were so silly and meaningless that I am starting to get tired of it. You need to do certain things pretty much without much sense just to be able to get a coffee from the barman, but afterwards it gets even worse when you are expected to interact with a chewing gum and a cockroach to be able to progress. Elements that have nothing to do with the story and the plot. You need to solve a situation with those in order to progress with the game. Silly.

You also need to take lots of notes and screen shots as there is no journal or map or hint system. It's beyond Nintendo hard.

Good fun game with lots of intrigue and a good plot.
Loved the creativity in the portals going to different scenes.
Loved the play on time, probably best part of the game.
The puzzles were generally good, some easy some harder and more complex.

Disliked:
I spent too much time on a key puzzle which was, in my opinion, illogical.  I think those who have played know which one that is.  It’s Drake’s closet puzzle.  Without giving it away, think about it, developers should know that the birth dates would not be relative to the keepers’ disappearance date but more likely to the date Drake got his promotion and moved into his room, i.e., 1907.  And even then, the puzzle is still obtuse…

The point and click has had its days.

76561198012450682,268830,Unknown,1.5833333333333333,,2,"Thumbs up, but definitely not a perfect game. The episodes themselves are fine, story and voice acting seems like proper Doctor Who episodes. Sadly the game has a few impractical things in it, low graphics and a few bugs. The mouse seems laggy in the buzzer game puzzle, which is pretty annoying. I also feel they overdid the stealth thing a bit; there's a lot of it. The music is great, ofcourse, the game uses the music from the tv show.

The sound in this game really bugged me; the voices did not seem to come from the characters properly and it didn't sound like the voices came from the place the character was; they sounded like they were in a sound studio (which they probably were) and whoever managed sound didn't do a good enough job to put the voices in their proper setting. The sound effects are also off; knocks on doors, for example, is randomly played and does not match the characters hand hitting the door. In the last episode, for some reason,; probably supposed to sound like wind or water; the sound sounded like a crap microphone sound over skype, like someone put their volume on too high and didn't speak, but the mic kept running. 

The game has a fairly low quality on the graphics, but most characters have a good likeness, with the exception, I feel, of Rory, who looks rather bland and not too recognisable. Amy's face makes her look 12, which is an awkward mix with her short skirt and the whole being married thing.

I experienced a few bugs; in one episodes it's possible to fall into the water, but you spawn on the harbour again almost instantly so no harm done. Another bug I had was starting the game from the main menu into a particular savepoint where there is a puzzle with lasers spawning in hallways that are timed and you have to move between corridors to dodge them. For some reason when spawning into this savespot from the menu one laser was on all the time and the other lasers never showed. ""Fixed"" by suicide, but annoying again. I also had a few times npcs would get stuck; mostly random npcs wandering around, but at one point an enemy as part of a stealth puzzle (made it easier so I shan't complain too much), but most annoying; when you are in a stealth puzzle and have a companion with you, your dumbarse partner has a chance of getting stuck and if you're reeeeally unlucky they will get stuck in a point where they are found by an enemy and killified and you have to start over.

Another impractical things; you cannot see your collection from the main menu in the main episodes; you have to quit to the menu to see it. 
The game has 2 options when opening it; either run the first 4 episodes or the longer Gunpowder episode. The first 3 episodes has 3 acts and when you have completed it you can start in any act, which is nice if you forgot a collection item. For some reason the Gunpowder episodes does not have this option and you have to start over from the beginning of the episode if you missed something. 

Is it for fans only? Probably yes; as with all the bugs and minor nuisances you can probably find a better game in the genre. Most episodes have enemies already seen in the Doctor Who universe, but nothing a newbie can't handle, with the exception of episode ""Tardis"" where you get a quiz about some things from the show (even from pre-2005). Nothing google can't fix and the questions don't change should you fail and have to try again, so you can always guess your way through.

Overall a decent game if you want to feel part of a Doctor Who episode or five, but not the best game for its genre and a non-fan should probably look elsewhere for p&c adventure.

Edit: Typos | Очень неплохая игра, жанр которой я бы определил как «Интерактивный фильм»: головоломки простейшие, игрок зачастую просто продвигает сюжет вперёд, а во время игры создаётся ощущение, что каждый эпизод является очередной серией Доктора.

    İşte karşımızda Steam'deki bir başka Doctor Who oyunu. Bu oyun, Eternity Clock'a nazaran diziye daha yakın gitmiş. Oynarken bir yandan da Doctor Who'nun bir bölümünü izliyormuş hissiyatı veriyor. Genel olarak baktığımızda, yine birbirinden farklı bulmacalar ve etkileşimlerdeki küçük oyunlar var.

   Oyun toplamda 5 bölümden oluşmakta. Normal dizinin beş bölümü gibi düşünebilirsiniz bu bölümleri. Dalekler, Cybermanler ve birbirinden ilginç diğer uzaylı kardeşlerimiz.

   Oyunda oynanabilir 3 karakter var, oyunun içerisindeki 4 bölümde Doctor ve Amy, ve sonradan eklenen bölüm olan ""The Gunpowder Plot""da Doctor, Amy ve Rory.

   Oyunun asıl 4 bölümü dediğim kısımda kartlar topluyoruz aynı zamanda. Şimdiye kadarki Doktorlar, Companionlar, Enemyler diye gidiyor bu liste. Ve yine tüm bölümlerde çeşitli artifactler toplayarak, çevre hakkında ve dönemin yaşayışı hakkında da bilgi edinebilirsiniz.

   Oynanabilirlik açısından baktığımızda ilk 4 bölümü-ki önemli olan kısım burası- bugla ya da kötü fiziklerle karşılaşmadan, saç baş yolmadan bitirebiliyoruz. Ama çok umutla, merak ederek başladığım ""The Gunpowder Plot""da işler değişiyor. Adeta farklı bir fizik anlayışı kullanılmış, sanki farklı bir oyunun içine girmişiz. Çok ilginç buglar kalmış. Öyle ki karşılaştığım bir bugda oyun hata vererek kendini kapattı! Ama bu sinir bozucu kısım sadece oyunun ""The Gunpowder Plot"" kısmı için geçerli tekrar hatırlatalım.

   Siz yine de o 1 bölümdeki hatalara takılmayın, asıl 4 bölümü hatasız oynayabilirsiniz. Kesinlikle paranızın hakkını veren bir oyun. Oyunu oynamak için tam bir Whovian olmak da gerekli değil. Birkaç bölümünü izlemişseniz ve zaman geçirmek istediğiniz bir oyun arıyorsanız hiç durmadan alabilirsiniz. İndirim beklerseniz 7 liraya kadar düşecektir. | [b]Doctor who the adventure games is a game based of Doctor Who and has a set of episodes.
which include minigames, stealth, and pretty good stories.
Its more enjoyable if you like doctor who also i recommend watching series 5 atleast first.[/b]


[h1]The gameplay.[/h1]
The gameplay is mainly stealthing around or collecting items and doing minigames.
The minigames are pretty simple but sometimes annoying or boring, ill give some examples.
You havea minigame whre you have to get a part to the middle but if you touch any lines it resets,
You have a minigame where you use you're sonic screw driver to open doors by getting on the same signal.
There are also collectibles with facts.
The stealth does what its supposed to do its not anything special,the game does have a companion dies you die mechanic which kinda sucks.
Sometimes you just have to pick up stuff from the ground and use them on other things.

[h1]Story.[/h1]
The game has 5 “episodes” some are better then others.
The Main characters are voiceacted by the same people they are on the show.
I dont want to spoil the episodes so ill just give the order i like them the most
3-4-5-1-2

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
There not much to say here theyre decent and it has proper resolutions
Only complaint i have it you have to press a arrow to see the higher resolutions took me a while to find out.

[h1]Music.[/h1]
It uses some show music like when you complete a puzzle or at the end of a episode,
again not much to say here.


[h1]Final verdict.[/h1]
Its an decent game with basic mechanics and mainly has its story going for it.
Buy it if you like doctor who if not maybe you shouldnt. | This is one amazing game. At least, if you're a Doctor Who fan. The stories are well written and the dialog is witty so anyone might enjoy this game. But for those who love Doctor Who? This game is a must. There are five Doctor Who stories in all which tie into the show. Every story is presented like a television episode including the opening theme song and credits. But YOU get to play those episodes! The main characters are The Eleventh Doctor and Amy Pond. The character models for the game look just like the actors AND are voiced by the actors. All in all, it's a pure pleasure to play. I'm about halfway through all the stories and I still marvel at their high quality. Maybe the character movement isn't quite as responsive as it could be but everything else is topnotch and I am giving this 5 out of 5 stars. Just as I will rewatch Doctor Who episodes on tv, I will replay this game again as well. This is one of my best buys on Steam!

Oh, Additional: Gameplay - a mixture of stealth and puzzles. If you want action, I believe the other Doctor Who game on Steam supplies that."

76561198012450682,251570,7 Days to Die,11.283333333333333,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation, Strategy",0,"7 Days to Die is a great game, but any recommendation I could give it is inherently a bit double-edged because I genuinely think it was a better game last year. Just about everything I like about its foundation is still there; it's a survival crafting game that manages to be fully voxel-based and destructible without looking the part, with an emphasis less on exploring randomly generated terrain and more on exploring structures that are randomly placed but hand-made, with each one feeling like a fun mini-dungeon hiding its own little surprises. There's plenty of content, plenty to build, and it lasts a long time before getting old. I spent a long time playing it via gamepass before coming back to put 50 more hours into it with my usual group for 1.0, and we had a good time doing it. But by the end of it, we all had our own complaints as well. The problem with the 1.0 changes aren't that they ruined the game, so much as that they change it ever so slightly into a different type of game than the one we came to it for; it's like right at the end of development someone on the team played an ARPG and had an epiphany. 

Most of the changes feel like they were made for people who have been playing the game for thousands of hours and just want to grind efficiently, rather than new players just wanting to explore and play the game with fresh eyes. A minor example of this is the trader system; in the previous versions, any of the game's different vendors could show up anywhere, and it was possible to get lucky and find towns with two different ones in the area. In 1.0 we eventually moved into a town that had three traders, which was pretty exciting until I realized they were all Trader Hugh (sorry, Hugh) because of them being made biome-specific. You can obviously guess why they did this. For people who already know the game and just want to get going, it takes a lot of the guess work out of finding a trader of a certain type they might need to start optimally instead of having to wander for ages looking for one with a bit of bad luck. But for normal people, those sorts of experiences are practically a cornerstone of the genre; survival crafting games are all about generating funny stories caused by the randomness, and I feel like probably everyone that's ever played one has at least one memory of searching for ages for something and how good it felt when they finally stumbled across it or finding something they didn't even know was in the game after finishing it multiple times. Yeah, it can be frustrating in the moment, but that's why it's called ""survival"" crafting, not vacation crafting. Get real, man.

The last time I played this game, there was a clothing system that, while not necessarily robust, had a nice amount of variety, as well as minor gameplay elements. You could loot funny hats and put together outfits, customize your character's looks without worrying about stats, and dress for the weather. This has all been replaced with various sets of armor and a promise of re-adding it about a year later. You can still mix and match pieces of armor, and in some ways it can even be preferable with their individual effects, but each set also has a set bonus that encourages you to just wear a full set instead of dressing up the way you want to. Some of the funny items like cigars are still in the game, but only as accessories you equip to your gear with no visual change. And that's adequate -- at least there are still options, and while I wish there were more armor sets they at least look pretty unique -- but it just feels arbitrary, even mechanically. If you went into a snow biome from the start before, your character would end up freezing pretty quickly if you didn't have warm clothes to layer up with, and my first memory of such a thing was spending a night huddled by a campfire in a house surrounded by bears. Which is fun! I love having moments like those in these games. I went there in 1.0 fairly early on expecting to relive the memory, and found that because I had crafted basically any armor set at all I was already above the threshold of the weather doing anything more than a very minor stamina debuff. Why even bother?

But the thing that pisses me off the most is that despite its stat focus, the last time I played the game it did a good job of keeping the progression separate from the gameplay, so that you could comfortably specialize no matter what you chose to do as long as you were killing zombies and generally doing something. There were books you could find that gave unique and fun bonus traits, which are still there, but for the most part you were free to do whatever you wanted without feeling like you were lagging behind anyone you were playing with. In the current build, the entire system has been changed so that nothing really matters except the magazines you've read. Want to make better guns? Read 100 handgun magazines. Want to make better clothes? Without reading 100 issues of Fashion Weekly? C'mon, let's be serious! Nearly every crafting skill in the game now has 100 arbitrary points you have to raise by reading that many magazines (yes, yes, give or take 20 or so if you wear the nerd outfit, sue me geeksquad), and it's as tiring as you'd expect. Unless, of course, you do quests -- which are now basically the only viable way to progress even remotely smoothly, because of how often they reward you with loot boxes full of an assortment of magazines that are usually guided to what you're trying to level. And this, hundreds of words later, is my core problem with the new update. It doesn't matter if you want to loot, if you want to farm, if you just want to kill zombies; if you're not doing quests, you will burn out of the game long before you finish any crafting tree, to the point that it feels actively detrimental to just go out and explore on your own. Even the vendors themselves have been heavily nerfed to the point that most of their inventory is completely arbitrary in favor of the things you can craft at a given time, with their only lingering purpose being selling junk and occasionally buying things you're just too lazy to go find. Which would be fine, if the trader didn't still constantly get hung up on sending you to the same three or four buildings per quest tier or try to send you to Tilted Towers 6,000 meters away if your towns don't generate just right.

I'm sure some poindexter with 10,000 hours in the game is going to come into my comments like ""erm, ackshually, the changes added a sense of balance that was greatly desired for the pvp experience"", to which I say come at me because I am simply morally superior and way cooler. And despite my complaints, I do still maintain that it is still fun. But the reason behind my great american novel is to give context for the bottom line: is it worth $45? No. I mean, I don't even have to think about it, honestly. When I bought it the game was $25, and I thought that was a fair price then and it's still a fair price now. $45 is frankly a crack pipe price for it in its current state, especially given that it rocketed up that $20 with no meaningful changes from the previous build. But they have a lengthy roadmap listing out things that should have been in anything called ""1.0"", like bringing back the wardrobe system, adding in bandits, and even story content and new quests, which all sound like excellent ideas. If those end up coming to pass and don't get stripped down after 10 more years of rebalancing then I think the current price tag would be more justified. For now, just wait for a sale and don't be afraid to look into a few mods. | I can't play this game anymore. I got no patiences for this. It seems like the game has gotten worst with every version released in the last 3 years. It seems like the developers look at what players are doing and then deem it exploitative or just don't like it in general and change it. To summarize it, they don't like how the players are playing their game and they want them to play it how they (devs) want them to play it.
We went from alpha 12 creating sand molds for glass jars to now as of b25, no glass jars or containers or anything and want you to die of thirst on day one. We use to build underground and be safe, devs didn't like that and now the zombies dig. We then built air forts or off-ground bases, devs didn't like that and added physics to the blocks and coded zombies to attack the nearest support pillar to force collapse.
You use to build a small structure or clear and rehab a point of interest as a starting base after scouting for ones with forges or being near water. Devs didn't like that and now Poi's are deadly, and sometimes spawn zoms inside after placing your land claim block or bedroll. They marketed the game as a crafting survival game, but now have made it difficult to build and craft and forces you to loot all the time. 
You use to eat once and drink 3-4 times a day, devs didn't like that and now You're constantly starving and thirsty all the time. In alpha 12, you use to read books to unlock crafting or recipes and magazines to increase skills, the devs didn't like that and thought a skill point system would be better. They took the book/mags out in alpha 13-18 then reintroduced it in 19 to co-exist with the skill-point system, but now in b25, you need the books and mags to level up for everything.
You use to heal up and regain stamina after eating or drinking, and now you just a weak ass bitch, since food doesn't recover as much health and water is sparse. They cut down or remove quite bit of assets and gameplay from the game to simplify it and I think that has detracted from the game from it's earlier versions.
Now the fun pimps don't like the stealth mechanic and have null and negate it in the latest version.
That's just a fraction of the evolving changes. The game used to be pretty fun to now being such a total grind and chore, that I can't even stand it for 30 minutes before I quit out. 

I know what you're thinking, I'm complaining about how hardcore and difficult then contradict myself with them simplifying crafting and assets. But if you ever play the earlier versions, it wasn't as much of chore then as more of a realism and understanding basic build process, and it was quite fun. There was more to do. Going ""oh I need sand and clay, I need a jar for the mold, I need a forge, some metal or an anvil"" and put it all together to get 5 glass jars. Then I need water, pot and campfire. It was all obtainable and you had to manage it and it made it felt like you were trying to survive. 

Now it's like, you have to loot and get lucky, Do about 30 hits on a tree, block or door and now you're thirsty because you've exhausted your stamina repeatedly, so don't run or swing your club and avoid zombies, and hope you find water. It's a walking simulator with a looting mechanic. That's just bad game design. 

The Fun Pimps are not so fun, I think they are pure masochists that enjoy C&B Torture and they are making this game for those that enjoy that type of fetish. | 新版本更新后联机总是出现各种各样的问题。每次和朋友玩都是为了连接服务器花大量时间，往往还没开始正式玩就累了。 | 毎日過ごす中でなんかこうゾンビ倒したいなぁ、拠点作りたいなぁって

It perfectly captures the crude humor, outrageous characters, and overall absurdity that makes South Park so iconic.  The writing is sharp, witty, and frequently offensive – in the best possible way.  It's exactly what you'd expect from a South Park game, and it delivers in spades.
 
The gameplay is a surprisingly well-executed RPG.  The combat system is simple but effective, and the turn-based battles are punctuated with hilarious animations and dialogue.  The farting mechanics alone are worth the price of admission.  Seriously, you haven't lived until you've unleashed a devastating fart attack on a group of underpants gnomes.
 
Exploring South Park is a treat in itself.  The game perfectly recreates the town, complete with all its familiar locations and quirky residents.  Running around, interacting with the characters, and completing side quests is a constant source of amusement.  The sheer amount of detail and attention to the source material is impressive.  It's like stepping right into an episode of the show.
 
While the story isn't groundbreaking, it's a fun and engaging adventure that fits perfectly within the established South Park universe.  The characters are all perfectly voiced (with the original voice actors, which is a huge plus), and the plot keeps you entertained from beginning to end.
 
The only minor drawback is that the game can be a little repetitive at times.  The combat system, while fun, can become somewhat predictable after a while.  But honestly, the sheer amount of humor and nostalgia more than makes up for it.
 
Overall, South Park: The Stick of Truth is a fantastic game that any fan of the show should play.  It's hilarious, nostalgic, and surprisingly well-crafted. Highly recommended! | You get to insert yourself into the Southpark world and interact with all the different characters and environments, it's just like playing in an episode.
It's offensive, raunchy, unapologetic and hilarious and i absolutely love it, they don't make games like these anymore.

The cons: AI is respectable, but not too difficult to manipulate; no online multiplayer (though this may not matter for some, like me); the soundtrack can get a little bit old after a while.

-Terribly limited resolution options.
-No ability to play in windowed mode, only full screen, despite the fact that it won't even take advantage of my monitor's common resolution.

10 шиз из 10 | loved it, great story line and good puzzles. | This game held me on for the entire ride and it’s my first playthrough of it, I am not reliving nostalgia for it. It was very dark, had amazing Sound and Art design, genuinely probably the best for something this early in the genre had ever seen. Pretty much a masterpiece. However, there are a few things that plague it I must mention before I can recommend it

1. Some of the solutions are SUPER OBSURE or Insane during the first actual stage. Now this is not a surprising thing that this genre does, but I must admit the solution for the Bell and the Spring Pig was fucking insane. I sat there for at least a half hour, before getting so mad I looked it up because I had clicked a hair to the right, the spring pig did not work for me until the 2nd time I tried it and THE ITEM WAS SO BLENDED IN I COULD NOT EVEN SEE IT. Sorry it just really upset me, but the rest of the solutions and puzzles were top notch though.

2. There is a repeated glitch I found where if an NPC or yourself is either in the way or not in the exact point that the game wants, the animation and solution will not play. Example: For the Bell solution again, I went to use the item on it, however the NPC with the Lollipop stopped right where I was supposed to go and canceled the animation making me think I was wrong again, since I thought it was weird I tried again, same odd animation. Finally, I realized it was the NPC causing the problem and waited for the little brat to move, thus making the animation work and I could continue.

3. It is totally possible to skip dialog if you do things out of order. I was able to complete an objective at a later level without having to talk to someone about it, either that or I don't even remember which is unlikely cause I literally just finished the game, which leads me to my last thing.

4. Although, without question a masterpiece, the play time and run of the levels is very very short. 9 Hours for me on my first playthrough and sadly only playthrough as I don’t think there will be another because I don’t need the achievements that bad. 

In conclusion, if you like point and click, this game is Fucking awesome! Wear headphones and just imagine what the designers must have had to go through to hit the mark each level as they did, the game is genuinely creepy at times, however, I will admit some of the puzzles were hard and its very short, I would recommend waiting till you can get it on sale like I did, but by god, it makes Wishlist recommendations for sure.

TLDR: Fucking awesome point at click, Very Short, Get it on sale and Fuck Morgan

Se você gosta de mistério, terror psicológico e aquela sensação de desconforto constante, The Last Door é um prato cheio. O jogo aposta num visual pixelado minimalista, mas não se engane: a atmosfera tensa e a narrativa sombria fazem você esquecer os gráficos simples bem rápido.

🎮 Gameplay
É um clássico point-and-click, daqueles que você explora cenários, coleta pistas e resolve enigmas. A jogabilidade é simples, sem pressa ou ação frenética, mas a tensão é real. Você sente que algo terrível pode acontecer a qualquer momento, mesmo quando nada acontece.

🕵️ História e Clima
Inspirado em H.P. Lovecraft, o jogo mergulha em um terror cósmico cheio de segredos obscuros. Você controla Jeremiah Devitt, um homem que recebe uma carta enigmática de um velho amigo e acaba envolvido em eventos macabros. A cada capítulo, mais peças desse quebra-cabeça perturbador vão surgindo, deixando aquela sensação de ""quero saber mais, mas também tenho medo de descobrir"".

🎨 Visual e Estilo
Os gráficos são ultra pixelados, quase como se fossem de um jogo antigo de 8 bits. Pode parecer um problema, mas na verdade isso aumenta a sensação de mistério. Seu cérebro completa os detalhes que não estão ali, tornando tudo ainda mais sombrio.

🎵 Trilha Sonora
A música e os efeitos sonoros são de arrepiar. Cada nota do piano, cada sussurro no fundo, cada silêncio bem colocado... tudo é usado para deixar você na ponta da cadeira.

🧩 Desafios e Puzzles
Os enigmas são bem bolados, mas às vezes um pouco obscuros. Dá pra travar em algumas partes se você não prestar atenção nos detalhes, mas nada que estrague a experiência.

🏚️ Vale a Pena?
Se você curte terror psicológico, histórias bem escritas e não se importa com gráficos simples, The Last Door é um achado. Ele prova que o medo não vem de sustos baratos, mas sim do que sua mente imagina no escuro.

76561198012450682,288160,The Room,11.483333333333333,"Adventure, Indie",5,"The Room is a puzzle game where you solve a series of intricate puzzle boxes to uncover the secret of A.S., the person who called you to solve them.

The gameplay here is pretty simple: you just solve puzzles. Each stage, you're given one puzzle box, and you have to click around to figure out how each part opens or moves. The puzzles weren't very difficult. The only times I got a little bit stuck were because it wasn't clear that something was movable. There were a few puzzle types that were repeated once or twice, but it didn't happen enough to bore me by the end. 

The Room doesn't have a very developed story, but it is very atmospheric. What story you get comes in the form of notes from A.S., which give you some insight into what they were researching. The game has a mysterious vibe to it that gets creepier as you get further into the levels, from the increasing strangeness of the notes, the changing details of the room around you, and the odd noises mixed in with the background music.

This game was originally a mobile game and the movements you have to make were clearly designed with a touch interface in mind. You have to turn keys and cranks and pull up on lids. You also have to move the camera around to see the puzzle boxes from all sides or to line elements up a certain way for some of the puzzles. I played on a computer with a mouse, so some of those movements felt a little awkward. It was also a little annoying to have to adjust the camera so much to see certain things straight on.

Overall, I liked The Room. While the puzzles weren't difficult, I wasn't bored with them, and I enjoyed the creepy atmosphere. Although it was a bit short, I felt like I got a decent value out of the game, and I'm really curious to see what the rest of the series will have to offer. 7/10 | This is one of if not my favourite puzzle game. It's not too long and that is a huge plus.

This game has design/implementation defects that will render this unplayable for many gamers.  the game doesn't launch properly, it just forces your desktop into a locked 800x600 resolution and hangs, but you can at least alt+tab and kill the game process to recover your desktop.[/quote]

""Voodoo Whisperer Curse of a Legend"" is an older game from 2014.  It's a venerable 10 years old at the time of this review.

""Voodoo Whisperer Curse of a Legend"" is a Hidden Object puzzle game, the type you normally see on mobile app stores or even as browser apps.  There's literally hundreds of these on Steam, mostly published by Artifex Mundi, many of them free on mobile app stores, but this one will cost you money on Steam.  There's a historial/mystery theme to the game, but this is a just a veneer over a tired and overdone set of hidden object minigames and Adobe Flash tier puzzles, wrapped together with a bunch of static screens that you ""move"" through by tapping your finger on your iPhone screen.

While these kinds of games are popular amongst casual gamers, it's difficult to argue this is a great value proposition as a PC game, especially considering the price of this compared to the hundreds of free HOGs on the mobile app stores.

From a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.

There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.

The game only displays in 4:3 pillarboxed aspect ratio.  It's possible they developed this using an old CRT they found in a dumpster, or this game has been specifically designed for people gaming on PC's from 1995... either way, this isn't really acceptable in the modern era of PC gaming.

This is a really old game, and if they had made it today, it would be on the mobile app stores, but it predates those.  It's not clear why they didn't try to dump this on the app stores (since it clearly seems to be here as some kind of nostalgia gouge).  Maybe it was rejected by Apple and Google (they do have more rigorous quality standards than Valve does for Steam, after all).

Regardless, for all intents and purposes ""Voodoo Whisperer Curse of a Legend"" might as well be a mobile app, it has the same limitations and dumbed down qualities.  It's impossible to recommend such a game to PC gamers.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

Unethically, the developers have left this on the Steam store in an unplayable and broken state.  It's the responsibility of the developer to maintain their product, ensure it runs on all modern PCs, or if they determine there's defects and the game doesn't work, they should remove it from sale instead of misleadingly trying to scam gamers into buying knowingly defective products.

This is harmful to Steam and to gamers, not just because it's a direct and intentional attempt to scam people, but because it takes a share of the marketing space and visibility away from other games.  It's polluting Steam and making it harder for gamers to find genuine games and for genuine indie developers who put months or years into making proper games find an audience.

So, should you buy this game?  Is this one of the best of the 100,000+ games on Steam?

The developer is deliberately and unethically trying to scam gamers into paying them the ridiculous price of $4 USD for a game they know is broken.  Don't give it to them.  This is also competing with over 11,000 free games available on Steam, many of them far better than this paid product.
 | [h2] Save New Orleans from A Dark Voodoo Curse [/h2]
Continuing my trend of playing hidden object adventure games, I decided to try this one after an okay experience with [i]The Fog[/i]. This one felt even more fitting for the Spooky Season, which was really lovely.

Set in 19th-century New Orleans, we play as a young girl named Lillian, who is being mentored to use her magical abilities by Marie Laveau, the most powerful voodoo priestess around. However, as we are being taught, an evil and mysterious curse is set upon the entire town, putting each person into a deep sleep-like state and trapping their souls in the spirit world. It’s up to us to save everyone before everything becomes lost in darkness. Throughout our adventure, we will learn spells and create potions that will help with a variety of tasks, from getting objects to returning people’s souls and much more. Can we save our teacher and lift this awful curse for good?

Compared to other HO adventure games, this one felt slightly different, especially in terms of the graphics, but I don’t know if that’s due to the game's age. I really liked how this felt and thought its use of atmosphere was well done. It captured the spooky vibe that I was looking for. In addition to these aspects, I found the story to be intriguing and very engaging, and I wanted to learn more as I went along. However, I will note that the story does feel a little rushed by the end, and the game is definitely a short experience. As a spoiler, [spoiler]it makes sense that it is this way because the game ends with a “To Be Continued…” message, so there was meant to be a sequel.[/spoiler] Sadly, I found out that the team who made this parted ways with Gogii Games right after this came out, so we’ll most likely never see a follow-up. I can’t lie and say that it isn’t disappointing, as the story had so much more potential. If only they had been given more time and funds to complete this.

Other than this, I found the minigames and hidden object scenes to be fun to play. The scenes were a little tricky in terms of finding objects, but the game has a cool feature that allows the cursor to turn into a magnifying glass. That was a neat and handy feature. I also found the potion-making element of this to be cool. All in all, I enjoyed the game despite specific problems, but that isn’t the fault of the developing team. I would still recommend getting this game when it’s on sale as it isn't complete.

然而，问题不仅仅这么简单，这么优秀的游戏却有着一群跟我们思维构造不同的GM和MOD，他们在没有事先通知的情况下封了几乎所有参加过PVP的人，而且时间有的多达30天甚至是365天，经常玩这个游戏热爱这个游戏每天游戏时间足够长的所有国人无一幸免，而且申诉机制异常奇怪，真正该封禁的人被解封了，无辜群众反而被关在了里面，据一些因为玩游戏频率不高而侥幸逃过一劫的国人反应，本来偏小众的游戏的在线人数进一步减少，本来一场联赛平时1分钟以内就一定能排到对手现在却排了四五分钟都无法匹配成功，游玩人数大量减少，玩家纷纷弃坑，然而面对这种结果，GM和MOD却仍然表示满意，绝对自己做得很是正确。另外，由于这个游戏是人治，所以管理上有明显的偏袒，和mod关系好的人不会被封禁然而其余人很容易被封禁，据少数国人反应，游戏内可能有一定反华倾向，在世界打字中文会收获到举报，总之你一定要做好随时被封禁的心理准备即使你只是正常的老老实实的玩游戏。一次封禁很有可能直接抹消掉你之前的时间和金钱投入，所以，即使这个游戏很有趣，但大家入坑前还是要慎重，即使决定了入坑，购买付费内容的时候还是要慎重，毕竟，他们封禁你的时候不会在乎你花了几百几千人民币的。 | Pros:  I was transported back in time 30 years, the flavor and feel of PnP RPG gaming is perfect.

Cons:  The micropayment cash grab is gross.  You can play free for @30hrs, then you need to start buying access.
Also: this game is a _very cheap_ strat game, with minimalist card building elements.

If you want to feel the nostalgia - play for free.  Any other reason should be a pass.

I give it a thumbs up BARELY and only for the story and feels.  The game is a grind - barely entertaining. | 平时网好的时候用网页版，方便。只有网不好才用客户端，所以看起来游戏时间很少。

Do it. 

This game is an improved version of the original flash games, with a unique, old flash-game style I really adore honestly. 
The gameplay is often micromanagement, but I find it fun. This game was a worthwhile investment. | if you played previous 2 rebuild games this game is for you system requirements not so steep and i already finished the 1st city on story mode and 1 city in quick play on normal | I remember playing the two original rebuilds on a browser using flash when i was a child, and was very excited to finally play the final one on steam. It's rather enjoyable and I Definitely got my moneys worth, although there are a few things that make me not want to play it again.

The fact it isn't turn based makes it a bit more tedious than the two original ones as you must constantly pause in order to give them new missions, along with how you must position your defenders instead of them all counting towards a defence total. Also, the requirement to ally or eliminate all other factions to win a map makes it so that you need to tediously spam donations a few dozen times before you can move on to the next. Otherwise, it's still rather fun, and a nice finale to the series. | Best game ever made. This game is so awesome ><. So simple but so awesome. She made it so you can make mods for it.

Сразу скажу, что с оригиналом 2000 года я не знаком…

Моё погружение в тёмные уголки мрачной Трансильвании начались именно с её переделки под Android 2014 года. 

К добру ли это или к худу? Кто знает... Но честно говоря, это не столь важно, так как приключение мне всё равно понравилось, даже и без манящей глубины оригинала!

Запуская игру, я не знал, чего именно стоит ждать, поэтому первые полчаса пребывал в лёгком раздражённом недоумении…

Что это за фигня? Статичные картинки? В 2000-м году то, серьёзно? Значит, перемещаемся мы только между заранее заготовленными сценами? Но ведь даже в далёкой «Eye of the Beholder» 1991 года мы могли бодренько скакать себе по квадратом, используя привычное всем управление! А тут, стало быть, это не вариант? Тыкай мышкой по указанному направлению и взлетай? Мдаааа... И правда тёмные силы не на шутку разбушевались… 

Сюжет, надо полагать, отталкивается больше от фильма Копполы нежели от книги Стокера? Нуууу…ладно, пускай. Хотя стоящая ли это идея, тоже не очень понятно…

Более того, игра не особенно то стремилась мне хоть что=либо объяснить! Греби как говорится. Вперёд! Вот те мышка, вот те крест! х)))

Короче, собирался я уже вырубить игру и махнуть на всю франшизу ногой как вдруг умудрился найти какого-то ушлого бандита и…грохнуть его?! Серьёзно?! Вот это было неожиданно, честное Бельмонтское! Отлично! А то это уже начинало напоминать какой-то детский утренник, где-нибудь за полярным кругом, где ночь по 30 дней длится, а тут такая радость! Воооот… Это разговор… Погодите-погодите ка, дайте ещё полчасика поиграю в это наследие нулевых… =))) 

Так дело у меня и пошло! 😉

Оказалось, игра то просто отличная. Нужно было только пообвыкнуться с её непривычной дубовостью и всё! Скажу даже больше, ко второй части мне эта её неповоротливость настолько понравилась, что я не хотел даже, чтобы этот стиль менялся. Нет, это отличный медитативный поход против зла, с кучей замысловатой машинерии, так горячо любимой ребятами из Microids! (привет, Syberia и Amerzone ^-^)

Дракула тут тоже самобытный вышел и с характером. А ещё у него тут хейтеры завелись! Красота то какая! Кол в графа хочу вбить не я один? Интригующе =))) 

В общем с удовольствием я прошёл путём Носферату и стырил всё стыренное им обратно! (кто прошёл игру – знают о чём я говорю) 😉

Если есть желание душевно отдохнуть в атмосфере олдскульой мистики и вампирщины – Вы пришли по адресу! 

Игра прямо-таки создана, чтобы выдернуть Вас из бешеного ритма современной жизни и гейминга, и втянуть в свой неторопливый уютный поток тёмного повествования, увлекая на пару тройку часов. Как раз то что порой нужно! 

Когда запускал вторую часть уже ждал этого медленного slow-life геймплэя и не обманулся в своих ожиданиях!

Unturned, Nelson Sexton tarafından geliştirilen ve 2014 yılında erken erişime açılan ücretsiz bir hayatta kalma oyunudur. Oyun, blok tarzı grafiklerle sunulan bir dünyada geçer ve oyuncuların hayatta kalmak için kaynak toplaması, barınak inşa etmesi ve zombilerle savaşması gerekmektedir.

Oynanış:
Unturned, oyunculara geniş bir dünya sunar. Kaynak toplama, yiyecek bulma ve silah yapma gibi temel hayatta kalma unsurlarıyla doludur. Zombilerle dolu bu dünyada, hayatta kalmak için stratejik düşünmek önemlidir. Ayrıca, oyuncular arasında işbirliği yapma veya rekabet etme seçeneği de vardır.

Kendi Yorumum:
Oynanış dinamikleri oldukça eğlenceli ve bağımlılık yapıcı. Özellikle arkadaşlarla birlikte oynandığında, keşif ve hayatta kalma unsurları çok daha keyifli hale geliyor. Ancak, bazen oyunun basit grafikleri ve mekanikleri bazı oyuncular için çekiciliğini azaltabilir.

Grafikler ve Ses:
Unturned, blok tarzı grafiklerle sunulmasına rağmen, bu tasarımın kendine özgü bir cazibesi var. Ses efektleri, oyunun atmosferini destekliyor, ancak bazen daha fazla çeşitlilik bekleyebilirsiniz.

Kendi Yorumum:
Grafikler basit olsa da, bu durum oyunun eğlencesini etkilemiyor. Hatta bazı oyuncular bu tarzı sevebilir. Ancak, daha gerçekçi bir deneyim arayanlar için hayal kırıklığı yaratabilir.

Topluluk ve Mod Desteği:
Unturned, aktif bir topluluğa ve geniş bir mod desteğine sahiptir. Oyuncular, çeşitli modlar ve sunucular aracılığıyla oyunu özelleştirebilir. Bu, oyunun ömrünü uzatır ve farklı deneyimler sunar.

Kendi Yorumum:
Topluluk, oldukça destekleyici ve yenilikçi. Modlar, oyunun eğlencesini artırıyor ve sürekli yeni içerikler sunuyor. Ancak, bazı sunuculardaki toksik davranışlar can sıkıcı olabilir.

Sonuç:
Unturned, hayatta kalma oyunları arasında kendine özgü bir yer edinmiştir. Basit ama eğlenceli yapısıyla, oyunculara hem zorlu hem de keyifli bir deneyim sunar. Eğer arkadaşlarınızla birlikte eğlenceli bir hayatta kalma oyunu arıyorsanız, Unturned kesinlikle denemeye değer.

This game was my introduction to Jane Jensen's work.
I haven't played the original GK (1993) but I did watch a playthrough.

This game is great, and I had a fun time being sucked into the world of Jane's creations yet again.

I did have a hard time originally getting into the game because of Gabriel and how he is, but honestly glad I pushed through it because he's really not all that bad. He shows a lot of growth by the end of the game, you watch him grow and change and it's great. Same with her other games including Gray Matter and Moebius, Jane's great at showing change and characters growth.

I really liked this game and it was a fun and wild ride. The writing is intriguing and beautifully done, the characters are all done very well, and I really like the music. Some of the music from this game is still on my favorite play lists.

I did notice from the OG to this version they did make a few changes, anywhere from adding or removing puzzles/changing the way some puzzles were done. 
Obviously the VA's changed too. Which isn't a bad thing, but I can understand the gripe with Gabriel's new voice, not gonna lie I did have a hard time because the way the southern voice was done didn't fit him.

My biggest issue is still the mime puzzle, I remember having a hard time with it the first time and I hated that puzzle the most. When I went to go replay I was dreading dealing with that puzzle again. The second time the mime warped across the screen and the puzzle broke so I had to restart the game, but I got it on the second try.
So that puzzle still seems to be bugged.


I doubt things will change now that Microsoft has  GK but here's to hoping Jane came make GK4.
I genuinely liked the game, and I think it's worth playing."

Story: Dylan is invited to a Halloween party of friends by her girlfriend Samantha (with special interest falling on Parker, the unrequited love).  While Dylan is taking a phone call from her concerned mother all her friends are sucked in the Jumanji-like game board.  (I personally do not think Miss Disgruntled (Dylan's girlfriend, Samantha) actually realized the game board was haunted by the ghosts of a previous tragedy.  The ""haunted"" game board simply recognized similar natures, and history repeats.)  Simple enough story line.
NOTE:  I really like the opening where the car headlights light up the pumpkin from behind before the car is seen and drives past.
NOTE 2: Safety announcement: Please do not talk on your cell phone while driving even if it is your mom calling.

Of all the reviews I read, good and bad, after I played the game I only have this to say: This is an old school Hidden Object game.  This is how they all used to be when actual story lines were first being introduced and being refined.  The games centered on the Hidden Object scenes, with the occasional pick up of inventory items to be used later or to solve some puzzle.  The games were not as strictly linear as they are now, but had a more ""open world"" feel with ""bottle necks"".  The games were also not nearly as ""hand-holding"" as they are now.  The gamer had to think and OMG guess about what had to be done, plus click everywhere.  Yes it was and is annoying and frustrating but that is partly what made the game challenging, out thinking the game/developers.    

Being a fool for old school this was a really refreshing game for me to play.  Very different puzzles and needing a completely different mind set compared to more recent and HD graphic ""hand-holding"" games of today.  One of the complaints centered on the half-completed objects in the hidden object scenes.  Well all I can say to that is you got what you clicked (Do remember this game was made before 3D was standard, so the objects were drawn in, not overlayed.)  

The actual puzzles of this game include suduko, logic, slide, matching, ""minesweeper"" among many other types.  This game includes a vast and usually unseen variety of puzzles compared to the color, sound, and match fare of today.  So no crying about how hard the puzzles are, expand your repertoire.   

If you want a challenging game and are bored with the standard fare of today, try yesteryear (in game time 2 years is like 2 centuries).  This game overall is quite challenging.  No penalties for hints which I had almost forgotten about being so used to today's games where there are penalties for hints, map use, and misclicks.  Hints were standard fare in old school and the gamer was expected to use the hint button... a lot, as well as be click ""happy"".  Guides and YouTube did not exist then like they do now.  

Old school games did not have (or require) achievements, in-game or later the all important steam achievements.  They especially did not require trading cards to even be considered playable.  So if as a gamer one is looking for those things, this game has none of that.  So welcome to the adult version of ""Highlights"" and enjoy what made the games of today what they are today. | Я потратил 5 часов жизни на прохождение этой *игры*, но так и не смог пройти ее до финала. На 6том часу у меня слетели сохранения и это событие погубило мои нервные клетки. По ходу игры было множество багов, вылетов, ошибок и т.д. Я очень не советую вам покупать эту игру! Редко пишу подобные обзоры, но это плохая игра, это ужасная и глючная игра! | Tout part sur le principe d’un bon gros teen movie et j’avoue que j’ai pris peur au départ… :

La protagoniste, qui va retrouver son meilleur ami pour lequel elle a un penchant, à une soirée, se fait accueillir par une gothique jalouse au sourire cruel. Soirée d’halloween autour d’un jeu type widja. Je vous laisse deviner ? Donc, notre protagoniste s’en tire bien (on peut remercier maman pour son coup de fil) Pour sauver sa bande elle va devoir percer le mystère qui englobe la maison hantée en délivrant les fantômes du passé de leurs péchés.  

Les cinématiques sont jolies, crayonnées en noir et blanc : beaucoup de caractère. Les personnages sont intéressants et l’intrigue plaisante à suivre. On parle quand même d’amour secret, de mariage raté, de suicide et de vaudou. Rien que ça !

-Bon…je déplore quand même l’introduction et la conclusion qui se sont résumées à un black screen me concernant…d’autres se plaindront de l’absence de sous-titres pour les cinématiques mais bon, dans l’ensemble, je pardonne.

Les décors, l’ambiance prennent bien tout en respectant la thématique fantomatique et halloweenesque et les SOC Scènes d’Objets Cachés sont assez complexes pour les rendre intéressant.  

Honnêtement, j’ai passé un bon moment ! 
 | A spooktacular game of mystery and evil perfect for halloween.  Those new to mystery games will find themselves hitting the hint button alot, though the game is friendly to new players since any puzzle can be skipped or the hint button can be hit if stuck.  Cant get lost because there is a map highlighting where an object of importance is to continue the story.  

The Hidden Object Puzzles can be very difficult, there are things that can be moved on screen in the puzzles, meaning you just need to click everything to see what moves if there is an item behind it since there is no cursor change.  Due to the games age many objects are difficult to spot due to them being very small or the detail is so low they cant be clearly seen.  During puzzles it may ask to find a heart, or a knife, but there will be tons of hearts or knives meaning finding some arbitrary one.  Other times objects are just named wrong such as saying ""darts"" but there are none instead there is a dartboard you click instead.  

There are not many full on Halloween games on steam so this is worth trick or treating it up.
Rating:  7/10  Value:  $2.99 | [h1]Short version: 53%[/h1]
If you like ghost stories, then this mediocre game should worth a few bucks for you, especially if it is on sale. It’s far from being the worst hidden object title on Steam, but even further of being the best.

[h1]Long version:[/h1]
Shadows: Price of Our Sins had a really sound idea behind it: a hidden object puzzle game featuring a ghost story about witchcraft, love, betrayal and tragedy. It’s the execution that suffers.

The game has no voiceover after the intro, so everything is told in large– and frankly, very boring– text dumps. Also, the main plot seen at the beginning pretty much disappears, and never gets a proper resolution: after solving the final puzzle, it just… stops.
The puzzles range from bad to above average. They are also repetitive, with an uncomforting emphasis on colour puzzles. Despite this it is recommended to play it on an easier difficulty, since they follow little logic: key items just turn up abruptly in the most unexpected places.
The graphic style fits well to the atmosphere, but it is also quite dated, which really shows in the meticulous pixel hunting of the hidden object scenes."

Hello everyone.

About Alex Hunter - Lord of the Mind Platinum Edition:

Very good hidden object game, with all that goes with, music, naughty graphics, puzzles, lifetime, bonus stage.

In short, everything is there.

To advise all fans of style and even to others.

On this good game has all. | Alex Hunter, kütüphanemde yer alan sayısız oyundan bir tanesiydi. Ona öncelik vermemdeki asıl sebep yıllar evvelinden benim de çeviri grubunda yer aldığım oyunçeviri gibi güzide bir çeviri sitesinin bu oyunu çevirmesi oldu. Ben de türün müdavimlerinden biri olarak neden olmasın dedim ve başladım oynamaya. Bu yüzden öncelikle oyunçeviri ailesine teşekkürü bir borç bildiğimi ifade etmem gerek. Bunu da ifade ettikten sonra elimizden geldiğince bir şeyler karalayarak, yardımcı olmaya çalışalım.

Şu ana kadar pek çok dosyayı içinde bulunduğu karanlıktan gün yüzüne çıkaran ve olayları aydınlatan Alex Hunter adındaki özel bir dedektifi oynatıyoruz. Günün birinde ünlü bir bilim adamı olan Isaac Patterson ardında hiçbir iz bırakmadan ortalıklardan kaybolur ve polis işi çözmek için devreye girer. Polis her klişe senaryoda olduğu gibi bu işi de eline yüzüne bulaştırır ve işin içinden çıkamaz. Bu salatalıklardan bi' cacık olmayacağını anlayan Patterson'un kızı olayı bizim gibi ünlü ve özel bir dedektife bırakmaya karar verir. Karakterimiz, bunun kendisi için çantada keklik bir vaka olduğunu ve işi aldığını ifade eder. Babanı bulduktan sonra seni istemeye de gelirim artık kız diye kaş göz işareti yapmayı da ihmal etmez. Şaka bir yana olaya el atan Alex, ipucu yakaladıkça bu vakanın umduğundan farklı olduğunu ve hayat memat meselesi olduğunun farkına varır. Sıradan bir vaka bir anda bütün dünyayı ilgilendiren bir mesele haline gelir. Spoiler olmasın diye söylemiyorum, amacımız bu meseleyi tümüyle ortadan kaldırmaktır.  

Alex Hunter Lord of the Mind, saklı nesneleri bolca bulmamız gereken ve bulmacalarla dolu tıkla ve ilerle şeklinde gelişme kaydettiğimiz bir macera oyunu. Bana olay örgüsünü tahtaya yansıtması olsun, sağlam düşünülmüş bulmacaları olsun ne yalan söyleyeyim bir Sherlock Holmes havası hissettirdi. Arada sırada bu bulmacalar beni çıldırtmadı değil ama yine de çözmek için uğraştığım her bir dakikasına değdi diyebilirim. Neyse lafı fazla uzatmayalım da oyunun gülü ve dikeni diyebileceğimiz noktalarına değinelim. 

[u]Artıları[/u]
+Bulmacalar sağlam düşünülerek oluşturulmuş.
+Görseller göze hitap ediyor, çizimler oldukça başarılı.
+Olayların birbiri ile bağlı olup olmadığını gösteren bir olay örgüsü mevcut ve bu bir tahtanın üzerine işlenmiş. Bir noktadan bir noktaya gidebilmek için hızlı seyahat özelliğini kullanabiliyoruz.
+Tatmin edici bir oyun süresine sahip olması
+Müzikleri sıkmıyor aksine insan ruhunda dinlendirici etkisi yaratıyor.
+Günlüklerde sadece karakterimizin yaptığı yorumlar değil, bulduğumuz ipuçlarının orjinal hallerinin de bir köşede yer alması

[u]Eksileri[/u]
-Bu tür oyunlar için en önemli unsur senaryolardır. Klişe bir senaryoya sahip olması büyük bir eksiklik olarak karşımıza çıkıyor.
-Resmi Türkçe dil desteğine sahip olmaması (Bu benim için çok önemli o yüzden bir kez daha Oyunçeviri ailesine buradan teşekkürler)
-Ekstra bölümün olması oyun için bir artı olabilirdi ancak sırf oyunu uzatmak için yapılmış olması ve gereksiz yere uzatılması benim için koca bir eksiden öteye gidemiyor.

Sonuç itibariyle artısı ve eksileriyle Alex Hunter Lord of the Mind evet belki çok iyi bir oyun olmayabilir ama yine de uygun bir indirimde bir şans vermek yerinde bir karar olacaktır diye düşünüyorum. Hem vurdulu kırdılı oyunlardan arada sırada uzaklaşmakta fayda vardır diyorum ve herkese iyi oyunlar diliyorum. [6/10]




 | Unfortunately, I'm not recommending ""Alex Hunter - Lord of the Mind Platinum Edition.""  The game's got acceptable graphics for what it is.  But, it has enough gameplay issues that I just can't recommend it.  To wit:

- This is supposedly a Hidden Object Game (HOG).   In a HOG, the non-HOG puzzles should be perception-based with some mild logic puzzles of putting together the pieces you have.  There are certainly HOGs in this game.  But, in general, the non-HOG puzzles are mostly what appear to be heavy logic puzzles.  In reality, they're really just brute force puzzles.  With a logic puzzle, you examine the situation, figure out the rules, and determine that the answer is X.  In these brute force puzzles, you can't do that.  The best you can do is look at the situation, figure out the rules, and optimize your moves to try to minimize the combinations you have to try before stumbling upon the answer that works.  Very frustrating in a HOG-type game.

- The game will randomly re-activate HOGs you've already done, but give you no game-based reason to go back to that area and see that a HOG has re-activated.  The only way you figure it out is when you're stuck and either look at the map to see an old area now has something for you to do there, or wander back through all the accessible areas to see.

- The story is even more filled with holes than the story in other HOGs.

Yes.  I got about 8 hours of play out of the game.  But, the game is just not good enough to recommend.  I suppose if you can find it for a couple of dollars or in a heavily discounted bundle, you could try it.  Just be aware of the situation. | Play as Alex Hunter, private investigator, hired by Miss Patterson to find her missing scientist father.  Fortunately this game has nothing to do with the 'Maltese Falcon' or 'The Shadow' beyond that ""noire"" flare.  Takes place in the late 1800's, I estimate, from the crazy inventions and steam powered ""science"" which inspires today's steam punk.  (I really love the elevator.) Action/adventure/mystery all rolled into one.  Damsel in distress, rescue her father, stop the crazy ""mad"" scientist and save the world, what more could one ask for?   

Well executed linear storyline with just a place or two that feels ""padded"".  Mostly point and click, but enough hidden object scenes to still be an actual hidden object game.  Puzzles of various types and not all of them in the neat little game puzzle boxes.  Some of the more puzzling aspects of this game is simply trying to figure out how to do something, or just where an item is.  I must point out that I really liked the fact that if the player thinks they need a screwdriver, they really do need a screwdriver and not a coin or bobby pin or some other obsure, does not quite make sense item to solve something.  It simply becomes a matter of where is the screwdriver.  As far as actual designated puzzles I only remember one as being a down right frustration.  Since there is no penalty for skipping a single puzzle, I skipped after about 10 minutes of game time.  After I skipped I remembered there was a walkthrough and I could have looked up the solution. C'est la vive.

I hope this becomes a series because I really like the character Alex Hunter.  He reminds me of Humphrey Bogart for some reason, that cynical, rather jaded overlook on life probably, or could just be the voice acting in the introduction.  Regardless I really would like to go through those previous cases involving fraud, theft, bribery, and murder.  Sounds like a good adventure to me.

This game has those hidden/ghost/shape shifting objects so do not miss them, since the previous chapters lock so there is no going back.  There is a bonus chapter after finishing the main storyline, in game achievements, and accesible extras (wallpapers, production sketches).  Steam also has achievements and trading cards.  

All in all an excellent game, and I personally like the pregame music."
76561198012450682,286500,Unknown,3.283333333333333,,0,"This is an extremely well done game. I played it a couple times before ever getting Steam and then, once I became a Steam addict, I bought this game for the cards. And played it again. And now I'm playing it for the fourth time. Yes, it's really that good. If you're a hidden object fan, you should definitely check this out. | Whats behind 1000 doors?  Good voiceacting with lots of spooky stories because you play the super spook detective Kate Reed!  The hidden object puzzles are real creative, instead of looking like a flea market threw up they fit the scenery for item hunting.  There is a hint button, and the puzzles arent too difficult, but you cant stuck because if a person wants to just throw their life away they can hit the ""skip"" button bringing shame and dishonor upon their family.    A helpful map indicates areas of interest because with 1000's of doors a map is kinda critical.  ooOOoooo the artwork is so nice in this game, everything looks so spooky and the objects in the Hidden Object Games are very crisp and clear so people shouldnt struggle to much.  This game plays like a book, its a very exciting page turner, where instead of just one story there are several stories to free the ghosts trapped here on earth.  The house can travel through space and time, so who knows where you might end up!  

There is a bonus game after the main game that lets you solve some additional mysteries.  More than just a mere room its a whole series of events, puzzles, and more hidden object games so this game is a good value at the price.

(A concept art gallery would have been nice because the art is very good, seeing how it came to life would be nice.)

Il punto di forza è senza dubbio la varietà dei puzzle, mai ripetitivi: ogni sfida è unica e stimolante. Un tocco di classe sono i criceti nascosti, la cui storia si sblocca progressivamente catturando questi piccoli personaggi, aggiungendo un piacevole incentivo all’esplorazione.

Il tallone d'Achille è il gameplay frammentato: troppo andirivieni tra ambienti per completare un singolo puzzle. La continua necessità di spostarsi, prendere oggetti, tornare indietro, craftare componenti e poi riposizionarli diventa presto faticosa e spezza il ritmo dell’avventura.

Nonostante questo, Nearwood mantiene un fascino fiabesco che lo rende un'esperienza visivamente incantevole, ideale per chi cerca relax e leggerezza senza troppe pretese.

Once I figured out how to use the map...(Silly me) it went a lot faster then having to click back all the time. 

Not everything is obvious and I had to peek at a few walk throughs to figure one or two things out, but over all it was a good time waster. My son enjoyed watching me play it and helped me as well. 

I will be buying other titles of this as well. I really enjoyed it. | This is the fourth game in this series, and the closest to a sequel of the first game House 1000 Doors: Family Secrets. (I have played all 4 games in the series, in order.)  It is stand alone, as is, but the series storyline might confuse a player as the game briefly refers to previous game adventures in single ""throw away/reveal"" lines depending on how much of the series storyline is known.

The story: The Palm of Zoroaster, a cursed orb, has been destroying things, people and quite possibly civilizations (or at least, select parts of it) for centuries.  Your job is to destroy the orb.  (No spoilers because there are some if one has been following the series storyline.)  Learn the orb's history, witness its destruction, and of course discover how to destroy it and gather the means to do so.  

The game is set up with an introduction/tutorial, four adventure chapters, and the final conclusive chaper.  I rather like this setup which is different then other HOs with a much more linear storyline.  What changed in this game from the first game (Family Secrets) is the player does not get to choose which adventure to embark on first.  For this game and storyline purposes it is perfect though.  

Hidden object scenes, mixed with some head scratching puzzles and the usual standard puzzles, plus some point and click and a chapter by chapter accumulate and use inventory.  Nothing too hard or tear your hair out challenging.  Game comes with a walkthrough the player can access if they get stuck in game or on a puzzle.  Every puzzle has a skip option and sparkles on needed objects or mini puzzle scene.  Unless playing in Hard mode.  There are three game modes available, in-game achievements, wall papers and a bonus chapter.

Warning: If you are hunting for those elusive extra ""hidden/ghost/shape shifting"" objects make sure you have them all before leaving the introduction or adventure chapter because you cannot go back once the chapter is finished. (Except in a new game).

Opinion: I like the series, therefore I like each game.  The overall concept is interesting and lends itself to innumberable further games.  The only thing I did not like in this game was the end.  I was expecting a much longer cut scene.  It ended and I thought ""Wait, that is it.""  The adventure ended, the game ended, but the end felt truncated.  Ah well the bonus chapter made up for the abrupt conclusion. | 系列第二部的点击解密游戏

在这里最近同样出现了很多奇怪的事情，比如出现腾飞的火球，墙壁发烫，水无热沸腾
玩家需要做的就是根据获得的道具逐渐解开背后的真相
此名为千户之屋的地方，内部存在通往无数其他国家/地区之门（这一定是任意门！！）
而游戏也正是利用了这些门，分别去到西藏、印度、耶路撒冷、马达加斯加
在每个地区中寻找水晶骷髅然后换取下一个地区的钥匙
最终找到了一切灾害的起源：琐罗亚德斯之掌，并将之摧毁
然而事情还没有结束（完成主剧情后，解锁额外剧情）
屋主加百列告诉我，他并非千户之屋的主人，而是从前任屋主中继承而来
而他现在也即将离世，希望帮助了他2次的主角能接着继承下去
不明真相的我进过一番调查后，发现原来他受到了诅咒，会因此快速老去
当然作为主角的我，并不会见死不救
又经过了一番调查后，终于获得了能够解除诅咒的金苹果
在加百列吃下金苹果后，诅咒终于解除
而游戏剧情也在此结束

3.游戏整体剧情大概8个小时左右
在开始游戏到达第一个场景加油站时可以选择难度
其中普通难度，可以调查的地方都会显示亮光，并提示你要做什么事情
因为游戏也没有成就，所以只是玩剧情的话建议选择这个
没攻略的话基本上也不会太难

4.游戏有内置攻略
在主界面右下角，点开后会有详细的通关步骤
不过整个游戏顺序并不一定要完全按照这个做
游戏当前所有可以触发剧情的地方都会在地图里显示
按照整个提示走也行
唯一需要注意的是，游戏里面的46个超能物品（隐藏物品）
部分是过了后续剧情就没办法再得到的，所以要及时找到

5.有汉化
我是直接下载完后把DataLoc目录覆盖掉就能用了
界面、对话、攻略界面都汉化了 | Evil has taken over at the House of 1,000 Doors since your last visit. It's up to you to travel through dimensions again to save everyone and particularly Gabriel, the protector of it.

This game is the sequel to House of 1,000 Doors: Family Secrets and you'll find some familiar characters, if not everyone from the first game. The plot is also a good written. You're going from China to the jungle, which means many exotic backgrounds for someone who is used to a western city.

The gameplay is the usual one: click on items that you'll need in another scene, solve puzzles, find hidden objects in specific areas, etc.. I found everything well-balanced. Also, you have close-up views in these hidden objects scenes and some objects you can move as they're also hiding items to find.

But what made me love the game, though I've hinted it earlier, is probably the journey through 4 different worlds and meet people that knew about Gabriel - I found it nice that the guy has a background, though it's breaking the charm around this mysterious man (but the more is known in the bonus chapter). And the scenes are really well drawed. You're really transported into other worlds.

The soundtrack is also nice but didn't change from the previous game.

So if you're a fan of HOG, you have to own this game. Besides, there are trading cards with nice emoticons and backgrounds. | ★★★★☆ - hodnocení v rámci žánru Hidden object

Kupoval jsem ve slevě za 1 euro a za tuto cenu mohu doporučit, za plnou cenu nemá smysl, za 10 euro se dají koupit lepší hry.

Poměrně solidní hledačka od ALAWARu, grafika by mohla být malinko lepší (ostřejší), jinak zpracování ok, ozvučení a hudba fajn, příběh ujde. Dohrál jsem za 4 a půl hodinky bez použití HINTů. Není toho moc, co by se dalo hře vytknout, ale ještě tomu něco chybí. HO obrazovky se opakují a předměty také. Velkým kladem je čeština ve hře, ač lze občas najít i lepší překlad (přesnější) pro daný předmět.

bodlo - kord
nahrávka - gramodeska 
dláto - majzlík
věšák - ramínko
kulka - nábojnice
koblížek - donut
hrášek - lusk
olejová lampa - petrolejka

Procházení lokací pomocí mapy je rychlé a bezproblémové. Puzzle minihry ujdou, ale ničím moc nepřekvapí, ve hře jich není ani mnoho. Nemá achievementy, což ubírá na snaze něčeho dosáhnout. Celková hratelnost je ale dobrá, nikde jsem se moc nezdržel, nebo nezaseknul, za mě to na 4 hvězdy má.

+ Příběhové videosekvence
+ Rychlý pohyb po mapě

- Opakování HO obrazovek a předmětů

76561198012450682,238320,Outlast,3.316666666666667,"Action, Adventure, Indie",0,"В общем, прошел игру на одном дыхании за 3.5 часа без длс и могу сказать, что игра очень спокойная и приятная. Ламповая атмосфера и спокойная музыка снимет с вас накопленный стресс и расслабит как подобает.
Рекомендация для прохождения: играть в 3 часа ночи с приглушённым светом и обязательно, обязательно повысьте громкость для улучшения релакса. Удачной охоты... | [h1] Outlast [/h1]
[h2] Score: 8/10 [/h2]

If you're like me then you absolutely love watching these lost place and urban explorer videos. Likely, you have also seen such a video on an abandoned hospital or perhaps even an asylum. If so, you're already pretty well prepared, because this time it's not empty or abandoned; quite the other way around. Outlast, released back in 2013 by Red Barrels delivers a combination of these sorts of videos and horror. 

Taking on the role of a daring journalist, you head out to Mount Massive Asylum, out in the middle of nowhere. Armed with nothing but a whistleblower document, informing you about the horrific human experiments supposedly taking place inside the asylum, and your trusty camcorder, equipped with a night vision mode. This camcorder is the heart of the game and what makes it stand out. You will witness almost the entirety of the game through the screen of that thing, making it feel like a collection of found footage. You'll need the night vision to navigate the dark areas of the Asylum, which will burn your battery life, so collecting AA batteries is a top priority. 

Outlast is less of a game and more of a test of your fight-or-flight response - think of it more as hide-and-seek game on the hardest difficulty. Except the seeker is a bloodthirsty lunatic and there is no happy ever after if they happen to find you. You can't fight back; you either run away or hide, or accept your fate, and that's where the beauty of this game lies. It lies in those hopeless moments you run away from a group of lunatics, not knowing where to go and asking yourself ""what next?"". It's hiding behind a desk and debating on if it's better to stay hidden or just send it. Those moments when you're perfectly thought out plan fails and the chase music starts playing, your heart pounding as you run aimlessly through the halls trying to shake off your pursuer.

The gameplay is what kept dragging me back into this horrible Asylum. The rush of adrenaline when you see something glowing in the corner of your camcorder, in the darkest possible place, and have to ask yourself if it was an enemy or nothing. This game lives from the sections of the game that are not scripted. Those sections that change every playthrough due to the AI's and your own behaviour. It's extremely immersive and strong enough to make you forget that it's all just a clever combination of 1s and 0s on a screen. 

The game is split up into 3 (4, counting cutscenes) major gameplay elements.

1) Exploring 
Usually the most atmospheric, and serve as breather sections. You find documents that elaborate the lore, recharge your camcorder using batteries and witness the still horrors of the asylum.

2) Chase
Intense yet scripted chases. They give you a good kick most of the time and make you feel desperate. They're extremely well made using little tricks that keep the tension high. Like climbing, squeezing through gaps, or my favorite, doors that open toward you. 

3) Freeroam Objectives
Intense but sadly very repetitive. You are set out into a wider, open area with a set of goals and an enemy. Like, for example, turning the power back on, which requires switching on three seperate levers. These are genuinely great, since like mentioned before, the way these go down change practically everytime depending on your playstyle and the AI's tendencies. 

Some other noteworthy things to praise are the length, story/atmosphere and especially soundtrack. The game doesn't overstay its welcome and ends in about 3-5 hours. Which is a pretty good length. It stops before it gets repetitive. 

Outlast's atmosphere is crazy good. Thanks to the soundtrack and just general atmospheric work. The camcorder records every bit of dust in the air, the sounds are great, you almost always hear distant screams and cries, steps or people banging on doors. Every chapter has a distinct environment and i feel has a nice creative twist; like the dark sewers, where your every step in the water can be heard, or the prison, where you'll be nice and close to all these lunatics in their cells. Additionally, this shit is also (almost) entirely based on a true story! So if you're interested, you can do some research on the game's topics after you finish. It's worth it. And whether you are slowly stepping around the foggy courtyard, or being chased by the big fat guy, the soundtrack perfectly illustrates these moments. Seriously, the soundtrack deserves a michelin star and is overlooked so often.

Sadly, when there is no apparent enemy around, the game does rely heavily on jumpscares to keep the horror part alive. These.. are fine but a) you only fall for them once and b) they are all verryyy similar. You're almost always jumped at by a patient accompanied by an over the top scream. But it also has some genius scares that i wont go into ;).

Over all, i think even 11 years after launch it's still well worth it. Though not at full price, get it at a discount. Like most games it's usually on sale about every 1-2 months. It'll definitely keep you entertained and occupied for a while.

Игра с первых минут переносит в прекрасное время 1 курса медицинского университета, когда староста 500 раз объяснила, где находится кабинет, но ты все равно потерялся и не понимаешь куда идти в огромном здании универа. Дальше игра неожиданно переносит тебя на первые пары нормальной и патологической анатомии, когда ходишь мимо учебных препаратов, шарахаясь, вдруг кто-то из них все еще живой и сейчас прыгнет на тебя. Но наибольшее удовольствие приносят флешбеки с кафедры психиатрии, когда преподаватель оставил вашу группу одних в отделении и ты всеми силами избегаешь взглядов и разговоров с пациентами, а иначе придется повторить судьбу Вейлона Парка... | 10/10 game. Very scary.

A lil backstory... I got this game for the first time back in 2022, but I was so freaked out that I ended up refunding it. Decided to give it another shot and repurchased it… well, now I can’t refund it because I accidentally crossed the 2 hour mark. So, I’m stuck playing this game.

Now, coming to the game... It scares the crap out of me. It took me about 17 hours just to get to the sewers chapter, and that’s on normal mode. The fear factor has definitely stretched out the playtime. I’m guessing it’ll take me another 20 hours to reach the end. I’m not sure if I’ll finish the game or if the game will finish me."

Almost every episode builds up to something that is quickly resolved in the most awful way imaginable or just goes nowhere. Choices matter even less than usual with this one, too. Even if you're a big GoT fan like I am, waiting for GRRM to finish those books or Chinese water torture might be a more enjoyable use of your time. | Finally finished this miserysimulator after forcing myself to play it. Most choices dont seem to matter and just leads to the characters getting punished, humiliated or killed.

I'm glad this is over so I can uninstall and try to forget. | Game of Thrones: A Telltale Game Series – A Tale of Betrayal (Both in Story and Development, and Also in Availability)
If there’s one thing Game of Thrones taught us, it’s that life is cruel, unfair, and no one is safe. Fittingly, Game of Thrones: A Telltale Game Series delivers that same gut-punch—not just in its story, but in the fact that it ends on a massive cliffhanger that will never be resolved because of the ill-fated collapse of Telltale Games.

But hey, that doesn’t really matter anymore—because you can’t even buy it on Steam. Like so many characters in Game of Thrones, this game was brutally erased from existence, delisted from the store with no chance of return. Unless you already own it or find some alternative means of playing, it’s as good as gone.

Not that you'd be missing much in terms of agency. Telltale was famous for making you feel like your choices mattered, but let’s be honest—they don’t. No matter how cunning or careful you are, the story mostly funnels you down the same miserable path, with only minor differences in who dies now versus who dies later. It’s Game of Thrones, after all—everyone loses eventually.

And yet, despite all that, it’s still an engaging ride. The writing, voice acting, and atmosphere feel authentic to the show, and the tension keeps you invested—right up until the final episode drops a brutal cliffhanger that will never be answered.

Would I recommend it? Not like it matters—you can’t buy it anyway. | L’œuvre de Georges Martin a connu son heure de gloire à la télévision, et Telltale vous invite à plonger dedans. Vous allez passer une douzaine d’heures en compagnie des principaux membres de la famille Forrester, petite famille au service de la Maison Stark, et soumise à l’autorité des WhiteHills, sur l’ordre de la Maison Bolton. Un jeu très dangereux d’intrigue, de soumission, de complot et d’honneur se met en place. Parviendrez-vous à garder la tête haute et bien accrochée à vos épaules ?

Vous revivrez quelques moments parmi les plus décisifs de la série HBO, et voir des visages très connus, doublés par les comédiens officiels. Et dans la peau de l’un ou l’autre des Forrester, vous devrez prendre les bonnes décisions pour rester en vie et empêcher la chute de votre Maison.

L’atmosphère est très réussie, comme d’habitude chez ce studio, on s’y croirait. Mais une chose m’embête : le jeu prétend faire évoluer l’histoire selon les décisions du joueur. Or, si effectivement il vous fera faire de nombreux choix, vous verrez que vous n’aurez que l’illusion d’avoir un choix alors que vous n’aurez pas le choix. Ainsi, vous aurez l’impression de voir l’histoire se contorsionner pour qu’il arrive un événement en particulier alors que vous aurez tout fait pour éviter cet événement. C’est un parti pris frustrant.

Considérez ce jeu plus comme une série spin off, et tout ira bien. | Ayant fait ce jeu avant d'avoir vu le moindre épisode de Game of Thrones, je peux dire qu'une connaissance de la série ou des livres n'est pas requise.
On reste ici dans la lignée des jeux Telltale Games de cette époque.
Les différents épisodes sont assez plaisants. Les personnages sont nombreux et je pense que l'ADN de l'œuvre originale est plutôt adapté à ce style de jeu à choix, même si, comme d'habitude, les choix n'ont au final que peu d'impact. Cela fonctionne tout de même au niveau de l'immersion.
Je mettrais ce Game of Thrones plutôt dans le panier haut des productions du studio dans le genre du récit interactif (que je distingue des point & click comme Sam & Max de leur première période)."

Игры от Дэйва Гилберта (Уаджет Ай) и Франциско Гонсалеса (Грундислав Геймс) стали для меня давно знаком качества и невероятно интересного приключения, глубоких и серьезных историй. Эта игра не стала исключением, но заняла особое место. Легкая ностальгия и грусть, как будто в поисках важного утраченного, попытках его вернуть и исправить, присуща юной героине Эми, страдающей от серьезного заболевания, которой необходимо собрать все силы и решить массу вопросов как для себя, так и для спасения будущего, вникнуть в политические интриги, поднять для себя вопрос веры - во что и насколько сильно, и вместе с иными героями игры пройти длинную дорогу. Качественный пиксель и интересные квесты не дают скучать, игра длинная и увлекающая за собой во вселенную альтернативного будущего, которое возможно очень близко...Браво создателям!
The games from Dave Gilbert (Wadget Eye) and Francisco Gonzalez (Grundislav Games) have become familiar to me for a long time and incredibly interesting adventures, historical and serious stories. This game was no exception, but it occupied a special place. A slight nostalgia and sadness, as if in search of an important lost thing, trying to return and correct it, is inherent in the young heroine Amy, suffering from a serious illness, who needs to gather all her strength and solve a lot of issues both for herself and to save the future. delve into political intrigues, raise the question of faith - what and how much, and, together with other heroes of the game, go a long way. High-quality pixels and interesting quests do not let you get bored, the game is long and takes you into the universe of an alternative future, which may be very close...Bravo to the creators!"

Even the wall of my room was decorated in Max's style – a tradition I carry to all the homes, or the resemblance of homes, I've changed along the way. In 11th grade, I made Max’s journal from scratch, it was one of my favorite pieces in the room, taking a notable place among my own personal and school diaries. I remember playing the 4th episode on a school week until 6am and going straight to school all hyped and simultaneously out of it. When Episode 5 came out, I sobbed for two weeks! My best friend at that time and I woke up so early that day, purposefully missed school, and spent all day immersed in that final chapter – her watching a live stream and I cursing at my old computer unable to handle Max’s time jumping shenanigans; of course, taking occasional breaks for comparing our declining emotional stability. [i]Life is Strange[/i] carried me from that final school year straight to University, helping me figure out some stuff about my own life along the way; as it did to many. Every time I turn it on now it just turns into a crying fest. From love, of course. But also sorrow.

Over the years, I’ve read so many players' intimate recollections prompted by the game's content; random snippets of people’s most vulnerable life stories sprinkled over each social media platform. Simply something awoken in people of all ages and backgrounds, perhaps by the game’s mellow nostalgic aesthetics and unabashed willingness to attune to the finest memories and emotions of our hearts. It was rather pleasant to witness the resurgence of [i]LiS[/i] fandom in late 2024, collectively reminiscing on our intimate interaction with the story, the newfound change in perspectives, and the passionate desire to mutually share all the warmth we still have for its characters. 

Living through Max was foundational for me, a self-conscious girl growing into confident adulthood with innocence violently ripped away from her. It was simply an average coming-of-age process, growing up and seeing a world from a different perspective, learning to connect and empathize with those around, learning from them and finding our own flaws and desires, recognizing them and growing to be better. But also a darker experience of going through my own sexual assault, of losing my own innocence, shifting and modifying the self to perhaps be more cynical and pragmatic, of maybe seeing the world through a darker yet necessary lens. Yet, ultimately, all of it forming one unified identity that is nevertheless a beautiful landscape of variable experiences and lessons; adulthood. I will always love the character of Max dearly. I will always cry noticing the gradual change of her vibrant diary doodles to objective, subdued in color entries with each passing chapter. I will always cry for the innocent love Max finds in non-innocent circumstances. The exploration of Max’s fractured mind following the violation will always mean the world to me, back in 2015 making me feel seen and motivated to start my own tumultuous journey of healing. I will always be grateful for Don’t Nod creating this beloved gamified companion to project our own internal worries onto, our transformations, and dreams; to reach intimate answers through a bittersweet, meditative experience.

[i]Life is Strange[/i] maintains sheer gratitude and wonder for each part of our environment while not rejecting the truth of the shadows stretching over the world’s corners. Finding beauty in the industrial powers of small towns, their nature, expansion in infrastructure, transformation of beliefs, unique differing people, and their interconnected messy ties to each other: as colleagues, students, friends, lovers. Finding beauty in the contrast of lives cut short, resentments, domestic disputes, destructive truths, violence, and uncertainty of tomorrow. Creating a living, breathing town that wishes to continuously evolve, grow, and adapt to the changing population making up its geographical landscape. Rachel Amber’s character is perhaps the most compassionate interpretation of Laura Palmer’s image I have seen, Chloe’s uncensored journey of clawing through grief calls to the most helpless moments of my own 19old self, and the understanding of violence captured in a human-shaped form still wounds me deeply: of course, so much of [i]LiS[/i] was inspired by and carried love for David Lynch’s legacy.


It's not so much the content of media; over time it becomes something bigger than its key narrative points. Rather, the events it accompanied in life, the memories you associate it with. That's when stories become truly dear to the heart no matter the years passed. It simply evokes a subdued feeling, like a thread granting the privilege to time travel to your own thoughts, memories, tastes, smells, relationships, places.

I tried replaying this game in so many locations now it can be drawn onto a map, like a shi+ty road trip. But I never lasted very long, about 30 minutes before I lose my cool completely and start thinking of the hand-drawn picturesque walls of my school. Of the captured memories sprinkled over my walls. Of the path to my home from school, from my friends, from the center, from my mom's job, from the park, from the waterfront. Of the last school days and giving away my books. Of getting closer with my classmates and finally understanding how similar we are. Of looking out my window, the windows of my friends, the windows of my school – and seeing sunsets, sunrises, golden hours, whirlwinds, blizzards, screeching hot days. Of dark days. Of town spots I avoid. Of town spots I wish could stay with me. A living breathing town… trapped in hazy, fleeting pieces of memory. Out of reach, a resemblance of something that used to be, overwritten by new places and people – when it's one of the last anchors you have to that past you cannot go back to. Learning to hold the value of delicate memory, accept darkness, and cherish its lighter undertones.

Finally replaying the game after these years, I’ve been finding new connections with Arcadia Bay, of the radical shift it makes from a nostalgic warm town to a harbor of ruin. How it strongly encompasses both, yet neither. I’ve been thinking of how the geography of my town has been modified, its prior identity forever wiped away. I’ve been countering the grief of losing childhood physically and emotionally with the fleeting traces of glee that used to be. On dark days, I will always hold on to the memory of sitting on the hot-to-the-touch boulder stone with my childhood friend, giggling about our new life developments, surrounded by forestry of a quiet park and bright sun. Of looking around me and seeing kids become more expressive in their identities, unafraid to look, think, and love however they please. Of regularly visiting my school and checking in to see if the asphalt drawing we made in dedication to our class teacher has faded away, or the chamomiles covering the school’s entrance are still greeting the children. Of peaking outside from the large plants covering my mom’s windowsill and seeing the rose we have planted outside slowly rise and bloom. Of always having a prepared 2h15m playlist to accompany me on the trip to my town from the nearby big city.

Nowadays, [i]Life is Strange[/i] transports me to the hot summer days of my home. 
I will always be grateful for having a chance to time travel. | I've been wondering for a long time whether ""Life is Strange"" is a game I could recommend or not, since it has very positive reviews and a slew of fans. I also expected such an experience. Unfortunately, I have to admit that the game disappointed me. Don't get me wrong, I fell in love with the demo version (chapter one), which promised an elaborate crime story with several suspects and lots of decision-making. We were introduced to the characters along with our heroine (Max), as she was new to the school. It promised a story full of excitement, mystery and consequences of our choices.

Unfortunately, after purchasing the full version of the game, with all the chapters (21 hours played), the spell faded in several different ways:

1. The game turned out to be a delusion of the consequences of the choices (except for the final decision at the end - although this one is disappointing in terms of the logic of the choice and the realization of the consequences, especially in the case of one final).
 
2. The game deliberately distracts us from some characters, completely forgetting them as criminal suspects. Because of this, we are unable to gather evidence in their case. Which is then supposed to cause surprise, shock, etc. - A cheap, ineffective ploy.

3. Overly cinematic final chapters. At one point in the game, there was so much story told in interludes and stills that for most of the chapter, the player had nothing to do but minor linear activities that contributed nothing. This killed my immersion and and even more my sense of control and decision-making.

4. Little bugs. The ending cutscenes have a number of close-ups of characters talking without their mouths moving. There are so many of them that at some point it becomes uncomfortable. The time reversal system is also sometimes unintuitive and can erase a decision even though it was not intended.

**[Warning: little spoilers]**

5. Final decisions: It is supposed to arouse emotions, but whether it does so is not necessarily the case. The first ending looks good and emotional, but the second one is dull and bland. In addition, it shows that everything we did throughout the game is irrelevant to our protagonist Max (all the friendships we've made, the lives we saved, etc.). That's not how you write good endings.

6. Imbalance in the characterization of the characters. Just as most of the characters are good written (they have their own motives, secrets, behaviors and are believable), I cannot say the same about two of the main characters who should arouse sympathy - Chloe and (maybe) Warren.
The friendship between Max and Chloe is, in my opinion, completely one-sided. Chloe uses Max's skills like a toy, she doesn't accept criticism, she's explosive and I didn't get the impression that she actually cared about her friend or even respected her, her character and way of being. Thus, he forces her to engage in various activities, even though Max points out that such activities are not to her liking or even can hurt her. Despite this, Max keeps repeating wonderful words about lifelong friendship and can also create a love bond with her. The only positive aspect of Chloe's character is at the end, when she realizes all these elements and talks about them, and makes her first unselfish decision.
As for Warren, he's written strangely. He's supposed to be a geek with a crush on Max, and he basically is, but throughout the entire game I had the impression that there was something strange about him and that he was hiding something. | 沉浸感无敌，剧情不拖泥带水，就是克洛伊像个啥币，看后续剧情发展吧 | This is one of the best video game stories ever told – a true classic.

Когда разработчики ARK: Survival Evolved решили вписаться в жанр королевских битв, казалось, что идея неплохая: битвы с динозаврами, приручение прямо в бою, выживание против других игроков – всё это могло бы стать чем-то уникальным. Но реальность оказалась печальнее.

[h2] ✅ Что в игре хорошего: [/h2]
✔ В теории – интересная концепция (если закрыть глаза на исполнение).
✔ Динозавры в королевской битве – звучит круто, но только звучит.

[h2] ❌ Почему в это никто не играет: [/h2]
✖ Мёртвая с момента выхода – онлайн просто нет, даже боты бы не стали заходить в эту игру.
✖ Кривой баланс – если ты не оседлал Т-Рекса в первые минуты, то готовься стать кормом для тех, кто успел.
✖ Отвратительная оптимизация – просадки FPS, лаги, баги, как будто движок и сам не хочет, чтобы эта игра существовала.
✖ Никому не нужна – на фоне других королевских битв вроде PUBG, Apex Legends или даже фанатских серверов в оригинальном ARK эта игра просто не имеет смысла.

Это не просто провал – это игра, которая умерла ещё до того, как кто-то всерьёз в неё поверил разработчик. С таким же успехом можно попробовать сыграть в PUBG на выключенном мониторе – хотя бы нервы целее будут.

2 из 10 покинутых серверов. | ARK: The Survival of the Fittest is the ultimate test of survival where it’s not just about fighting dinosaurs—it’s about surviving in a world where everything, from the weather to the creatures to your fellow players, is out to get you. Picture this: you’re dropped into an island with nothing but your wits, some rocks, and a stick, and you’ve got to figure out how to stay alive while dodging massive carnivores and attempting to avoid becoming someone else’s dinner. Add in some players who think they’re the island’s top predator (spoiler: they’re not), and suddenly, your quest to survive turns into an all-out, hilarious game of “who can mess with who first?” Trust me, it’s intense, but also surprisingly fun when you realize you’re a second away from being eaten by a T-Rex and you somehow make it out alive. That’s when the real fun begins!

At its heart, ARK: The Survival of the Fittest is a battle royale-style game set in a prehistoric world, filled with dangers both natural and player-made. The basic premise? You, along with other players, are dropped onto a hostile island where you must gather resources, craft weapons, tame dinosaurs, and try to survive long enough to become the last one standing. The twist? You’ll need to strategize, team up, or even betray others to outsmart and outlast the competition. It’s not just about surviving the creatures; it’s about surviving the players too. Tame some raptors, build traps, create defenses, and get ready for combat because the last survivor on the island wins. Oh, and don’t forget about the giant mutant spiders and those terrifying, unkillable bosses roaming around. In short, everything wants you dead, and you have to be smarter, stronger, and faster to avoid becoming dinner.

What really stands out about ARK: The Survival of the Fittest is the blend of survival mechanics, strategy, and chaotic multiplayer action. The vast array of creatures you can tame and use in combat adds layers of complexity to the gameplay. The game rewards strategic thinking, from deciding when to team up with others (and when to stab them in the back) to figuring out the best way to hunt or avoid the island’s mega-predators. The crafting system is deep, and the thrill of gathering materials to build your base and weapons while fending off enemy tribes is incredibly satisfying. If you’re into survival games with a high stakes, high tension environment where every decision counts—and where a single mistake could lead to an epic failure—ARK: The Survival of the Fittest is a must-try. It’s perfect for anyone who loves a challenge, epic dino battles, and the thrill of outlasting other players in a hostile environment. Trust me, it’s chaos—and it’s absolutely worth diving into! | sera que volverán los servidores alguna vez??? | Игра просто бомба от слова совсем!

Decaying Logic gelingt es auf einfache Art und Weise das beste Jigsaw-Puzzle-Game auf Steam zu betreiben. Ich sage bewusst betreiben, denn die Zahl der Erweiterungen steigt stetig und die monatlichen Challenges können durchaus als Community orientiertes Weiterentwicklen betrachtet werden. Es ersetzt natürlich kein echtes Puzzle, das Aufräumen entfällt aber und so viel Platz nimmt es auch nicht weg. Das Basisspiel bietet derweil nicht all zu viele Puzzle, lässt einen aber einen kostenlosen Einblick in die Mechanik gewinnen. Dabei wird von Seiten der Entwickler eigentlich alles richtig gemacht. Übersichtliches Menü, einfache Bedienung, attraktive Features.

[b]Features[/b]

Für das abschließen von Puzzles gibt es neben den Errungenschaften auch ""goldene Puzzleteile"" und während dem puzzlen kann man ""Hints"" finden. Mit den Hints lassen sich beim puzzlen Hilfestellungen anfordern (richtige Rotation eines Puzzleteils, genauer Ort eines Puzzleteils & kurzer Blick auf das Gesamtbild) oder 50 Stück können in ein goldenes Teil umgewandelt werden. Mit goldenen Puzzleteilen lassen sich Items im Kiosk freischalten. Von Zeit zu Zeit gibt es auch Events, wo für das Abschließen eines Puzzles doppelt so viele goldene Teile vergeben werden.

Decaying Logic hat mit dem erwähnten Kiosk ein Feature implementiert, welches als Langzeitmotivation angesehen werden kann. Neben kosmetischen Items zur Individualisierung des Spiels (Cursor, Musik, Themes), lassen sich auch sogenannte ""Uniques"", d.h. besonders schwere oder aufwendige Puzzle freischalten. Dazu können die bereits angesprochenen goldenen Puzzleteile verwendet werden. Auch alte Challenges lassen sich auf diesem Weg noch spielen.

Die monatlichen Challenges sind ein weiterer Pluspunkt bei der Entwicklung. Kostenlos und äußerst anspruchsvoll, lassen sie den Puzzle-Fan schon die ein oder andere Stunde vor dem PC verbringen. Die Motivwahl ist dafür auch sehr unterschiedlich, wobei die Farbnuancen und die Puzzle-Form der Einzelteile einen zuweilen zur Weißglut treiben. Bei erfolgreichem Abschluss erhält man ein sogenanntes ""Ultimate Piece"", welches auch im Kiosk eingelöst werden kann. 

[b]Die DLCs[/b]

Ohne Packs wirkt das Spiel recht leer. Wer bereits die anderen Spiele der Pixel Puzzles-Serie erwerben konnte oder sie bei einer der etlichen Promotionsaktionen kostenlos erhielt, der kann sie bei der Ultimate-Version nochmals spielen. Auch das ein oder andere DLC kann noch kostenlos im Netz gefunden werden, wie bspw. DaVinci oder Beach Volleyball, sodass man eine doch schon recht große Auswahl an Puzzlen (ca. 100) von Beginn an haben kann. Es bedarf aber etwas Arbeit im Vorfeld!

Die DLCs scheinen auf den ersten Blick natürlich überteuert, jedoch erhält man für die Preise i.d.R. guten Content. Für 0,99€ kann man dann, je nach Erfahrung, mehrere Stunden mit puzzlen verbringen. Wartet man auf einen Sale, rentiert es sich erst recht. Bewertet habe ich jedoch nur all jene DLCs, welche regulär mehr als 4,99 Euro kosten. Dies wären ""[i][url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Xeeran/recommended/591508/]Spanien[/url][/i]"", ""[i][url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Xeeran/recommended/591502/]China[/url][/i]"" und ""[i][url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Xeeran/recommended/589651/]Pin-Ups[/url][/i]"".

[b]Fazit[/b]

Das Spiel bietet jedem Puzzle-Fan eine platzsparende und gute Alternative zu herkömmlichen Puzzlen. Wer in Pixel Puzzles Ultimate nur einen teuren Jigsaw-Puzzler sieht, den er auch kostenlos im Netz haben könnte, der verkennt die Vorzüge. Ein Test kann nicht schaden, weshalb ich auch nichts zur Mechanik sagte und sollte die meisten Interessierten überzeugen können. Denn dort gibt es keine Beanstandung. Einzig die Musik nervt, doch mute und Radio schaffen abhilfe!

Условно бесплатная. Бесплатного контента хватит не надолго, за остальное придётся очень сильно раскошеливаться. Картинки в большинстве своём для сбора не интересные, а зачастую вообще откровенно уродливые. Такое впечатление, что разработчик ходит по рынку изображений и откладывает в корзину всё самое захудалое,  что людям стыдно продавать дороже чем даром. А ведь можно было бы набрать шикарных фотографий, но нет. Гниль всякая ближе к сердцу.  Количество кусочков в пазле никак не регулируется и находится в ведении злой фантазии разработчика. Как его левая нога возжелает, так и будете собирать. Захочет - будете 1000 кусков собирать, а захочет - только шестьдесят.

Я долго следила за развитием этой игры и убедилась, что его нет. Баги и недорзумения как были, так и остаются, неудобства и нелепости игрового процесса как были так и остаются. Но зато стабильно клепаются всё новые и новые DLC. Причём по совершенно конским ценам, словно я на фотостоке покупаю эксклюзивную лицензию на эти изображения.  И с чего бы вообще им столько стоить? Всё же по накатанной, покупка изображений по копеечным ценам, программное разбиение их на кусочки и всё. Алгоритм давно написан, интерфейс тоже. Дел на пять минут. Вы одной своей покупкой дополнения за полную цену окупите все затраты разработчика на годы вперёд.  Фантастическое рвачество.

При этом долбаных карпов и лотосы я должна принудительно отключать каждый раз, когда гружу пазл, даже если вышла из него на минуточку, возвращаешься и опять эта помойка плавает. Кому она вообще нужна? Что за дурная идея это всё вообще сделать?  
Картинка-превью по-прежнему микроскопическая и её нельзя увеличить, что бы рассмотреть подробнее. Так она ещё и обрезана по краям. Резать-то её зачем? 
Этот фильтр на фотоизображения зачем применять. Для чего я должна видеть эту размазню на кусочек пазла вместо чёткой картинки, по которой бы можно было нормально определить откуда этот кусок? Чисто из пакости души?
Почему при выборе опции ""играть в окне"", не только скудный набор нелепых разрешений, но и окно не разворачивается во весь экран? Это кривые мозги не позволяют сделать полноценное окно, или опять же, гниль за грудиной?
Почему до сих пор нельзя поменять цвета подложки для поля временного размещения избранных кусочков? Кусочки тёмного цвета туда откладывать вообще бесполезно, их на чёрном фоне не разглядеть. Казалось бы, простая функция, для других полей игры реализовано. А тут что, религия сильно против?
А какой извращенец придумал эту системы подбора кусочков? В какой больной ум пришла мысль, что когда я тыкаю мышью в свалку кусочков, то мне нужен не верхний, который я вижу, а нижний или какой-нибудь из середины? Пол-минуты можно потратить, пока наконец к мыши не прицепится тот самый кусочек, который я вижу и хочу взять. Пока докликаешься до него, вот уже и играть перехотелось.
Так же по-уродски сделан и поворот. То на 90 градусов повернётся, то на 180, сиди убивай нервы на попытке повернуть кусок в нужное положение.

Остальную кучу нелепостей и неудобств даже перечислять не стану. Хватает их, но начинать надо с вышеперечисленного.

В общем и целом, отзыв мой отрицательный, хотя игра в целом работоспособна, но рвачество и отсутствие желания довести её до ума бесит. Пора взбодрить разработчиков. | This is a rare case of a game I actually sometimes play but can't recommend, for some very simple reasons.  Why can't you connect pieces to each other?  Why can't you change the cut of puzzles?  Why is the DLC, which must be nearly no cost to ""develop,"" so expensive per image?  And WHY, if all the game does is puzzles, do the images seem to have no thought behind them as to what makes an image fun to assemble?

In summary, why would I invest in a bunch of DLC when someone could easily put a better jigsaw puzzle game on Steam and I literally would have no reason to ever come back to this mediocre option again...

...and now I think someone did.  I'm going to check out Super Jigsaw Puzzle: Generations.

I finally got around playing this game since I bought it a decade ago (2016 I just checked my purchase history!). I'll start by saying this game has a strong narrative and not so convoluted puzzles. Not once did I feel like having to randomly combine items to progress or trying to solve some mind-boggling puzzles that required me to look up a guide. The story was creepy and full of lore and great characters. The voice acting was superb (Jim Sterling voiced this!), plus the game allows you to manually save in case you're one of those achievement hunters. There's supposedly a sequel to this game with how they ended it but it's currently stuck in a development hell for years, plus the developer himself is sick in real life. So let's pray and hope for the best... | Story was okay. Probably could have skipped the very short middle story, it didn't add much.

It consists of three chapters that each take about an hour to complete.  The puzzles are VERY straightforward, so I wouldn't recommend it for people who are looking for a challenge.

It ends with a cliffhanger, and the sequel was never released, so skip this one if you want closure.  Definitely worth it if you get it on sale.  6/10. | pixel grafik point click bulmaca hikaye 3 farklı hikaye mevcut ortalama bir yapım | Very interesting game with weird twists - as much as I had no idea where it was going, I loved this game!

Honestly, I didn't expect much from this game. I knew it was old and thought it would be a few days trip. Ha. Haha! 
I ended up running in cities, collecting tinned food and moving heavy garbage containers. I had to hunt zombified animals in swamps and lure unique trophies into specific areas. 
Days turned into nights, when more dangerous species attacked my so recklessly built camp, which led into another adventure (read - vacuuming all visible resources!) and extremely careful preparation for further defences.

There were so many NPCs, sending my to find rare samples and their friends. Seemingly easy missions quickly turned into skills test (I played solo).

[b]How to Survive 2 got me 80hrs+ and I mostly enjoyed it. 
Few stupid mechanics annoyed the hell out of me e.g. inability to rotate camera - very often enemies are hidden by a wall or an object. Or my character would do a spinning melee attack instead of a straight hit and miss a zombie. Plus, when running, your character will do a parcour over a chair or car, instead of just ""rubbing and running along it"".

But generally, lots of positive vibes. Various quests, complex crafting for melee/range weapons AND enhancing medicaments. Moreover, there's a cooking system with more buffs and extra side-effects.

Take it for what it is. A low budget game made by a small team. It's fun for a couple of hours, despite of plenty of quirks. I felt plenty of times that ""I wish I have known this before I took this decision"" and by ""this"" I mean a pretty important mechanic that you build your character around. One such example is that you can't go on quests without your main character, hence he can't stay behind and heal. 

Also ludonarrative dissonance (you know, when the gameplay is contradicting the narrative, just as no way of resurrecting a character that dies during a cutscene in FFVII in spite of pheonix down) is very frequent. Among other things, in this game I had to waste a very valuable medkit on a fully healed character because of narrative reasons. | An RPG that is fun enough to be worth your money if you get it on a sale. It has some UI that's unclear and the missions are not also sometimes unclear but fun enough that I enjoyed it nonetheless.

I believe in enjoying a game so here's some quick tips of how to get around better if you decide to get this game (small spoilers on game-play and missions):

First, the missions are all done via inviting the person to join your party and then going to the mission area normally. For example: 
 - Jamal's mission to take him hunting in the woods is done by inviting him to your party and then going into the woods where you will hunt deer via small event popups. NOT putting him and the player on the job for hunting.

Second, for Lydia's mission, note that you must take her to a SPECIFIC diner (which I believe resides at 10/20 on the Highway (Day) map. NOT the small diner events you see in between. (Hence why I said there is some missions which are unclear)

Third, this is just a tip for enjoying the early game, Melee is very important to level to 3 ASAP as breakthrough is one of the few skills that reduce enemy armor, and Melee also don't cost ammo.

Fourth, healing is doable in combat when you get to Medic level 3, and YOU CANNOT HEAL YOURSELF, so plan to have at least two people with medic 3 if you need to heal.

Fifth, healing requires ""medical supplies"", engineering traps require ""engineering supplies"", and guns require ""ammo"", melee is the only thing that is always free. Plan your supplies accordingly.

Overall a hearty recommend, I enjoyed the game, thank you for letting us date certain characters as well, really liked that. I wish there was a way to avoid a specific event as it seems less reasonable that the event pops up even when certain criteria are not fulfilled. Would love to have this event be more dynamic, like it triggers if you fail to have enough resources or make a specific choice instead of this person will always betray you, just let them die.

Dead State (A game I also really like) also had this issue. There were certain characters you were better off not finding as they are guaranteed to lead to difficult events, and since this was unavoidable, the best thing to do is to never deal with those characters, which I felt decreases the immersion in the story in that game as well.

If you liked this game you may like Dead State as well. | merhaba arkadaşlar burak bullydenin ilk bölümüne hoşgeldiniz bugün sizlerle yeni serimiz bullye başlıyoruz arkadaşlar çok fazla istediniz hadi çek çek çek ya dediğiniz serilerden bi tanesi olan bully oynicaz bully biliyorsunuz baya eski bi oyun playstation 2de olan bir oyundu sonra bir pirsi bleblebleble bir pc sürümü çıktı pirsi dedim demin ee skolarşip editeyşın diye bir sürümü var biz bunu oynicaz şu anda galiba tamerde bu seriyi çekiyormuş kendisine burdan selam söylüyorum zannediyorum ondan çok gördünüz bana çok fazla bunu çekmemi söylediniz hani çek artık sende çek gibisinden çok fazla talep ettiğiniz için bizde seriye başlıyoruz efenim ben daha önce playstation 2 dönemindeyken bu oyunu bitirmiştim ama çok uzun zaman oldu (bi rahat oturayım) çok uzun zaman olduğu için çokta hatırlamıyorum ama oyunu hatırladığım kadarıyla size yine anlatıcam efendim. şimdi bizim elemanın adı jimmy jimmy hopkins diye bi çocuğuz arkadaşlar oyunda burayı dinleyelim ben size anlatıcam şimdi burda jimmy yeni bi dallama buluyor kendine yeni bir koca buluyor bulduğu kocayla bizim jimmynin arası berbat tabi jimmy hiç sevmiyor üvey babası hiç sevmiyor kendisini burda da dalga geçyior zaten anasıda ama tabi cici babacı yani babayı oğlundan daha değerli gördüğü için çocuğu yatılı bir okula yerleştiriyorlar aha bu okula burda durmadan yani seni buraya yerleştirdik kitledik artık seni yavşak haha falan gibi bu muhabbet var çocuğa kötü davranılıyor çocukta serseri yani serseri bi çocuk bizim jimmy hopkins bullworth academye yazılıyor aha bu okula arakdaşlar bullworth academy olması lazım okul güzel güzel bir okul okulda acayip olaylar gerçekleşecek şimdi görücez BULLWORTH academy şşırırt arkadaşlar bu cumartesi günü burak oyunda mobil uygulamasında canlı yayınımız var canlı yayında yine gta 5 oynicaz sizlerle birlikte gta online oynicaz bu yayınıda kaçırmayın efenim sakın kaçırmayın mikrofona vurdum pardon mikrofon e bu cumartesi günü saat 9da burak oyunda mobil uygulamasında canlı yayındayız gta 5 online oynuyoruz yayına gelin sakın kaçırmayın fışt dımdı mmdıdarı dımdım darı raririr burası okulumuz arkadaşlar bu arada sinematiklere altyazı koymamışlar niye koymamışlar bilmiyorum oyunumuz türkçe türkçe altyazılarımız var sinematiklerimizde yok orayı anladığım kadarıyla size anlatıcam efendim, yeni serimiz hayırlı olsun"

[hr][/hr]

В своей основе 60 секунд! представляет игру про управленчество, где надо поддерживать уровень воды и еды, заботясь о выживших. При этом элементов экшена, кроме собственно сбора ресурсов за первые 60 секунд забега, тут нет. Во время выживания события описываются в тексте с небольшим визуальным отображением. События тут происходят в случайном порядке, предоставляя несколько вариантов действия.  Общее количество возможных проишествий мало, можно за несколько забегов выучить как нужно себя вести в каждом из них, но при этом небольшой процент случайности остаётся. За счёт этого первые часы проводить в игре довольно интересно, изучая её механику по вылазкам за припасами и исходы возможных событий. Кроме того разработчики добавили сценарии, где нужно выжить при определённых условиях, добавляя ещё пару часов игрового процесса. Но после игровые механики исчерпывают себя и становится скучно играть, и тем более получать оставшиеся достижения и концовки.

Таким образом, если вы просто хотите игру на где-то 10 часов, то 60 Секунд! является хорошим приобретением. Но не надо стремиться получить все достижения или концовки.

Kıyamet yaklaşıyor, saniyeler azalıyor ve sen ne yapacaksın? işte 60 Seconds! Reatomized tam olarak bu soruyu soran ve oyuncuya zamanla yarıştığı, ardından stratejik kararlar aldığı benzersiz bir hayatta kalma oyunu sunuyor. Oyunun klasik versiyonu olan 60 Seconds! büyük ilgi görmüştü. Peki, Reatomized sürümü bu deneyimi daha iyi bir hale getiriyor mu? İnceleyelim.


HİKAYE ve OYNANIŞ 

Oyunda, McDoodle ailesinin bir üyesi olarak oynuyoruz. Ana karakterimiz Ted, ailesini ve gerekli malzemeleri alarak nükleer sığınağa inmeye çalışıyor. Ama işin zor kısmı şu: Bunun için yalnızca 60 saniyen var!

Oyun iki temel aşamadan oluşuyor:

 1. Hazırlık Aşaması: 60 saniye içinde evde koşturarak su, konserve yiyecekler, silahlar, gaz maskesi gibi malzemeleri ve  mümkünse aile bireylerini sığınağa taşımaya çalışıyoruz. Stratejik seçimler burada çok önemli, çünkü bazı eşyalar hayatta kalmanıza doğrudan etki ediyor.

 2. Hayatta Kalma Aşaması:
Sığınağa ulaştıktan sonra gerçek hayatta kalma başlıyor. Günlük olarak yiyecek ve su tüketimi yönetiliyor, dış dünyaya keşife gidecek aile üyesi belirleniyor ve rastgele olaylarla başa çıkılıyor. Hikaye ilerledikçe radyoaktif tehlike, mutant yaratıklar ve sığınağın içindeki psikolojik zorluklarla uğraşıyoruz.

Oyunun en güzel yanı, her oynayışta farklı bir senaryo yaşanması ve rastgele olayların olması.


GRAFİKLER ve ATMOSFER

60 Seconds! Reatomized, orjinal oyuna kıyasla daha canlı ve yenilenmiş grafikler sunuyor.
Karakter animasyonları daha akıcı ve renk paleti daha çekici. Oyun, çizgi roman tarzı sanatı ve karikatürize karakterleriyle post-apokaliptik atmosferi eğlenceli bir şekilde yansıtıyor.

Ses tasarımı da başarılı; gerilim anlarında gelen radyo frekansları, kapının vurulma sesi veya dış dünyadan gelen tehditler atmosferi daha etkileyici kılıyor.


YENİLİKLER ve GELİŞTİRMELER

Reatomized sürümü, orjinaline göre bazı önemli iyileştirmeler içeriyor:

✅HD grafikler ve geliştirilmiş animasyonlar
✅Yeni zorluk modları ve oyun modları
✅Daha fazla rastgele olay ve hikaye varyasyonu
✅Ted, Dolores, Timmy ve Mary Jane için ek karakter etkileşimleri
✅Seçimlerin daha büyük sonuçlar doğurması

Bu geliştirmeler oyunu daha yenilikçi ve tekrar oynanabilir kılıyor.


OLUMLU ve OLUMSUZ YÖNLER

✅Artıları:
✅Eğlenceli ve tekrarlanabilir oynanış
✅Stratejik karar alma mekanikleri
✅Yeni içeriklerle daha derin bir deneyim
✅Gelişmiş grafikler ve animasyonlar

❌Eksileri:
❌Bazen rastgele olaylar aşırı zorlayıcı olabiliyor
❌Uzun vadede aynı olaylarla karşılaşmak sıkıcı olabilir
❌Oyunun öğrenme süreci bazı oyuncular için karmaşık gelebilir



SONUÇ: OYNAMAYA DEĞER Mİ?

Eğer hayatta kalma, strateji ve kıyamet sonrası temalı oyunları seviyorsan, 60 Seconds! Reatomized kesinlikle denemeye değer! Her oyun farklı hikayeler ve senaryolar sunduğu için tekrar oynanabilirliği oldukça yüksek. Özellikle rastgele olaylar ve seçimlerin sonucu oyunu sürükleyici hale getiriyor.

Ancak, oyun bazen şans faktörüne fazla bağımlı olabiliyor, bu yüzden taktiksel planlama kadar biraz da sabır istiyor


Genel olarak, yenilenmiş grafikler, gelişmiş oyun mekanikleri ve eğlenceli atmosferiyle başarılı bir remastered versiyonu olduğunu söyleyebiliriz. Daha önce 60 Seconds oynadıysan ve beğendiysen, bu sürümüde deneyimlemelisin!

The days pass by in a rushed blur, yet it is always lunch time on Lunch Island. Strictly segregated by socioeconomic class, the island population is comprised of hunderds of silent and exhausted clones stemming from the same 5 or 6 white people and one brown man in a gray suit, creating an uncomfortable and unsettling atmosphere as you see the same person walk past your truck dozens of times per day. Scared of clowns? Get used to it, 20% of the island's economy seems to be from the clowning industry. The insane dictator they call ""Mayor"" will randomly threaten to ban products from lunch island for no reason, such as soda, though he seems to have a short attention span and never follows through on his threats, whether you successfully rally the island in protest by selling 10 soda's in 3 days or not.

You COULD pay less than a dollar for Lunch Truck Tycoon, further funding Mayor's regime of white supremacy and capitalist tyranny, or you could play something with just as much, if not more, depth for free on any flash game site. | I've been an avid video-gamer for more than thirty-years, both on PC and console, and I'm a very harsh critic. 

I don't generally waste my time writing reviews for games that are mediocre or just ""OK"". My reviews will either be very positive or very negative. 

However, in the case of Lunch Truck Tycoon things are a little different. Although I anticipated I would need more time to write a fair review, I only required 30 minutes of gameplay, as shown on my record.

The game is only $0.99 USD. Sometimes we get what we pay for, but in this case, Lunch Truck Tycoon offers just a little more than $0.99 of entertainment. 

I've would've gladly paid $20.00 for this game if there had been more strategy and customization options.

I hope that the developer has plans to expand on this game. I would definitely like to see some improvements via purchasable ""add-on's"" that increase the need for more strategy, and add more customization. Lunch Truck Tycoon should've been an ""Early Access"" game.

Will we see a Lunch Truck Tycoon 2 in the future? I hope so!

The development of ""Food Truck"" themed games has been neglected and is, in my opinion, an untapped oil well that would seriously appeal to the people who enjoy playing ""simulation, management, strategy"" games.

The game's artwork/graphics are of moderate quality. The animation and gameplay are smooth and moderately clean.

In closing, if you can afford $0.99 USD, buy the game and support an indie developer! In return, you'll receive a little more entertainment than what you paid for, and you can't have a legitimate complaint about that. | Hallo Freunde,
ich bin wirklich ein irrer Tycoon-Liebhaber, denke ich zumindest.
Nichtsahnend guck ich da mal wieder in den Steam-Shop und was entdecken meine kleinen Äuglein da?
Lunch Truck Tycoon!!!

Absolut euphorisiert direkt auf den Kaufbutton gedrückt und bezahlt.
99 Cent, die hatte ich gerade noch so übrig, nachdem heute mein halbes Gespartes für Cola Zero und Tomaten draufging.

Natürlich direkt installiert, der Umfang des Spiels wurde mir - bei glaube ich 30 MB - direkt vor Augen geführt.
Aber gut, für nen Euro sollte man auch nicht allzu kritisch sein.

Mittlerweile habe ich das Spiel fast 30 Minuten gespielt und denke mir nun schon alles gesehen zu haben.
Also umfangreich ist es nun tatsächlich nicht so ganz und irgendwie kann man auch nicht viel mehr machen, als den Play-Button drücken. Denn das Ganze läuft in sogenannten Turns ab, man hat ein paar Orte zur Auswahl wie City, Universität etc. und die einzige Entscheidung, die man da erstmal trifft, ist: Wo will ich mit meinem kleinen Verkaufsvan stehen.

Es gibt noch sogenannte Events, die aber spätestens beim zweiten Mal schon irre langweilig sind und ansonsten kommt wieder der Play-Button ins Spiel.
Damit einem die Entscheidung, wo man denn nun mit seinem lausigen Auto rumstehen möchte, auch noch abgenommen wird, kommt auf so eine Art virtuelles Handy immer mal wieder eine Meldung, wo gerade besonders viele Leute unterweg s sind.

>> Negativ
- fehlende Spieltiefe
- eintönige Musik
- wenig Entscheidungen für ein Tycoon-Game

>> Positiv
- Preis
- während der ""Turn"" abläuft plant man schon einmal seinen nächsten Tag im Real Life oder philosophiert über das Leben | For 99 cents, this is a great casual game to kill some time with.

-Difficulty follows your level perfectly
-Graphics are good for an indie game that costs 99 cents

In some related tycoon games, you're purchasing ingredients and are trying to get it right so that you can sell better stuff and make more money. For this one, all you are doing is just restocking and selling it; so there is no creativity involved. There are events where you can try to be creative, but even then it isn't fun and it's all guesses. Also, the upgrades are hard to obtain. Not all the upgrades are available, you need to level up in order to unlock them. The food trucks upgrades are all available, but they are very expensive. In this game, it takes forever to get enough money to get a better truck. Getting a better truck doesn't even do anything; all it does is make more room to put food in your truck. The days are short, so you don't make a lot of money. I literally had to way months until I had enough money to upgrade once. There are events so that you can get extra money and it is a huge help, but you are still a bit away from coming close to buying a new truck.

I had high expectations for this game and to be fair - thinking in retrospect now - I quite don't know what I was expecting... I guess I've already played so many CyoA games and I never encountered a game so boring. I mean, the gameplay is kinda fun, I liked the mechanics of managing the money and inventory and the little develop your character gets depending on certain iterations, but I felt really anxious with how fast the clock goes and the routes having to be discovered by pure chance... I mean, for instance, I was really wanting to go through Copenhagen, Warsaw, etc, but the routes were hidden and I had to discover them by talking and choosing the right answers rather than just talking and exploring. That was a bad choice - at least for me - because it forced me to spend +4 hours in a location I really didn't want to explore more and sometimes all this time and exploration wasn't even rewarded properly - at least not the way I wanted, lets say - because, first of all, it was supposed to be just a quick stop to bank and market and than procceed, much because the clock running fast, as I previously mentioned, and the game forced me to spend more time and I didn't get in reward what I wanted or expected. So, yeah, that's what put me off and I guess people should know about this before buying the game. | A casual fun game to pass the time.

Just a nice simple game. | A fun game that is easy to learn yet can be quite difficult at times. Once you start playing it continues to captivate you with its thematic artwork and excellent humour. A must try for all deckbuilding fans! | A fun game held back by some limitations in gameplay, some dungeons you just don't draw the map tiles needed to accomplish the goal in a reasonable amount of time. In others you get some powerful items offered and you just run away with the game.
There is some interesting gameplay in the simple style and very simple UI helps this. I didn't have any problems learning how to play the game. (initially I did when I had never played a card game before, and came back some years later to give it another shot and found it comically easy after playing several games now)

You'll lose a few adventurers just down to bad luck, sometimes you'll just get wrecked by being forced to fight an enemy  above their level. And sometimes you (or at least I) make mistakes, it happens but those mistakes can cost your adventurers their lives, something the game makes very clear to the player and it's not even meant to be a big deal, more adventurers will sign up very quickly.

So the interesting thing about this game is the maps are basically randomly generated from a set of tiles/enemies and loot. You build the dungeon, ideally towards a specific goal (kill the boss, collect X gold things and so on), unfortunately it's not quite as fun as it sounds. You'll sometimes get some very strong enemies you have to place, other times you'll get swamped with lots of low level opponents on the map and the dungeon will feel like a chore.
There's a little bit too much rng in what map cards are offered, and no way to edit or adjust the drawing of cards for that mechanic.

The actual combat is fairly quick and once you get to grips with the game. I'll say the first level or two of your adventurers seems to be when they're most vulnerable which is problematic because this is when the players are first using them, so most folk will never find out the stronger versions of your little gang of adventurers. (the traits can be powerful)
The biggest issue for me is that hp is just a bit too important, just a single point is enough to swing the outcome of some fights. 

You get to customise them but it's very basic, some hairstyle changes, rename them and a choice of 1 male or female voice. I started to get glazed eyes after customising my 8th or 9th adventurers, at some point the random visuals don't really matter, all that really matters at least to me was being able to complete the dungeons without losing the adventurers.

The level ups for the adventurers were a little limited, I think they mostly got +1 hp and after completing a dungeon they got a trait. I would have liked a bit of a skill tree to open up, rather than yet more rng.
The only real choice the player has in character customisation is what item they get to pick when they get the option in each dungeon.

The game is okay overall, it functions well (as it should, it's pretty simple in presentation). But eventually I saw through most of the mechanics over time and became a bit disappointed in how it wasn't simple enough to just let me have a fun time (adventurers die pretty easily), or complex enough for me to feel in control (lacking higher levels of customisation in various areas). 
Yet the game is fairly hard, particularly when you're first fighting a type of enemy for the first time in various types of dungeons. Once you get how to beat them it's no big deal, but until that point it's not a fun time.
It is however quick, each run is easily 30 minutes to complete or less so it's hard to feel to upset about it.

Honestly if I could offer on a sliding scale of review somewhere in the neutral region between positive and negative I would. (when I was having fun it was close to 8/10 experience, when I wasn't it was more like 3/10.  I don't know how to boil that down into one score)
You might enjoy what's on offer if you're really curious but for the most part new games do most of what this one does better and in more advanced and/or intuitive ways. 

Ever since slay the spire came out it's hard to argue anyone buy this game over something like that. Or even darkest dungeon. Or a whole host of other card games/rpgs if you want that kind of experience.

I respect this game for trying to tie together card games and dungeon delving but it just wasn't quite there for me. Not strong enough card mechanics to engage me on an intellectual level and not strong enough story/setting to get me immersed in the world/adventurers. Too hard to let me take it lightly and too comedic for me to take it seriously.

Anyways I'd still like to thank the devs for giving it a shot and working on the game for a good while after it came out. So many other devs just abandon projects if they're not immediate successes. | Oddly fun cheeky little game.  

Did you like playing Munchkin with friends, but you got old and got responsibilities?  Never hang out and play games?  This game is like playing Munchkin by yourself.  At least you have memories of having friends, right?

Seriously, though.  Feels like playing the solitaire version of Munchkin."
76561198012450682,388210,Day of the Tentacle Remastered,30.75,Adventure,58,"Love love love this game ! Originally had this game on a old Win 95 comptuer without sound ! This was so good to replay with sound !  Loved this game so much. I don't know why but i was hoping for a little bit more in a remaster. 

I can remember getting stuck for a long time over one simple action and be like ""holy fuck, that's what i had to do ?!?!?!?!? . 

Bought this game and beat it in a 2 hour session, just love love love this game ! 

Impossible to lose at this game unless you are not crafty and able to read the storyline well !!! | It's not hard to see why this game is still considered a classic, even for those who aren't superfans of the point and click adventure genre. I played Maniac Mansion on NES years ago and loved it, and while this game is a bit of a departure from it (you don't build a party at the beginning, the three characters don't interact in the same environments), it brings a lot of fun new elements to the table, like the amazing voicework (apart from Laverne, who feels almost comatose by comparison).

The graphics (I played the ""retro version"", which I'd recommend) are fun and colorful and cartoony, and remind me distinctly of Earthwork Jim. One of my few complaints about the game is the sound design; it's full to bursting with all manner of rehashed Saturday morning cartoon sound effects, which work fine, but the background music is drab and uninteresting. I only bring it up because Maniac Mansion had some of the best music of any game of any generation.

The game does have some intensely moon brain puzzle logic, but in my experience if you're playing a tongue-in-cheek cartoony point and click game, that's part of the package. One of the achievements, which you get after a particularly implausible puzzle, is actually called ""Oh yeah, I'm playing a cartoon"".

This game isn't for everyone, just as this genre isn't for everyone. But if it's For You, you'll know it. | Geniales Remaster eines der besten Adventures. Schade dass nicht alle Remasters von alten Stücken so gelungen sind. Viele verhauen die Steuerung total, weil sie der Meinung sind, das Rasd neu erfinden zu müssen.
Absolute Empfehlung! | A classic from the good old days of adventure gaming. Beautiful remaster. | It is what it says. A remaster of the classic DotT. I have not seen anything removed or changed in any bad way. It is the same game - but with better graphics. Also there is a possibility of having some of the creaters comment as you play along. That is a huge feature in itself.

Perhaps it appeals less to people not familiar with DotT. But if so it is a more modern way to play the game.

It is a very well meant and well made remaster of a fantastic game."

-jogo é grátis para OLHAR mas não jogar
-Fábricas tem trabalhadores Tartarugas Lesmas Mutantes e Preguiçosas  (entregam 1 recurso a cada 24 horas e param de trabalhar se vc não clicar para pegar)

Pros: Story line is pretty decent. 

Cons: Each time you explore an area, you use energy, and a large amount of it. You either have to wait several hours for it to replenish or spend money to buy more. The amount of time you are given to explore an area is only 1 minute. This is not enough time to find hidden objects, especially if the graphics aren't that great. If you are zoomed out of a picture, they graphics are nice, but when you zoom in to locate a hard to find object, the graphics become pixelated and somewhat distorted. Also, when you find a chest, you only have a very limited amount of time to solve a puzzle to open it. 

Overall: Game play time is limited and you almost feel rushed to complete puzzles and hidden object areas. | Ich habe ne Quest in dem Spiel bekommen, für die ich das Spiel bewerten soll. Da ich noch nicht allzu viel von dem Spiel gesehen habe, weiß ich nicht, ob Daumen hoch oder runter.
Ich weiß nicht, ob man sich später Kristalle dazu kaufen muss, weil man sonst nicht weiterkommt; momentan macht es nicht den Anschein.

76561198012450682,57300,Amnesia: The Dark Descent,0.0,"Action, Adventure, Indie",0,"Прошёл данную шикарную и легендарную игру целых 4 раза. Здесь прекрасно абсолютно все.

Атмосфера здесь на высоте. Постоянный мрак, какие-то скрипы, звуки криков и ко всему этому периодически проявляющиеся воспоминания главного героя о его призраках прошлого. Звуковое и музыкальное сопровождение также очень гармонично подчеркивают происходящее на экране. Периодически, по ходу игры, в голове героя всплывают различные сцены с диалогами, которые, в общем-то, проливают свет на его историю. Также по ходу прохождение предстоит собираться многочисленные записки, из которых можно узнать много интересного. 

Сама история игры и сюжет кажутся простыми и лаконичными, но при этом очень яркими и насыщенными, благодаря чему за столь небольшой отрезок времени, который занимает полное прохождение игры, возможно в полной мере проникнуться сюжетом и повествованием. Кстати, здесь есть русская озвучка и она очень качественная и аутентичная.

Графика в игре также очень приятная. Все работает очень плавно и без каких-либо багов и прочего. Движок сделан очень качественно, физика в игре хорошо работает на атмосферу во время различных сцен, а у игрока есть возможность перетаскивать и метать многие предметы окружения.

Что касается полного прохождения игры на 100%, а именно - получения всех достижений, то здесь есть пара недостатков. Большинство ачивок смело можно назвать простыми, так как большую их часть дают за сугубо сюжетные моменты, которые обязательно нужно будет сделать по ходу прохождения. С DLC уже нужно быть чуть внимательнее, ибо в нем нет никаких чекпоинтов и его нужно пройти от начала до конца целых три раза (на разные концовки). Но в общем, оно не такое уж и сложное. Единственное, так это то, что если случайно умереть - то вас просто выкинет из игры на рабочий стол, что слегка неудобно. На мой личный взгляд, двумя наиболее неприятными достижениями в Amnesia: TDD являются Illuminatus (на сбор 151 огнива) и Мазохист (прохождение игры на хардкорном режиме). Сбор всех 151 огнив - просто скукотища, а о хардкоре чуть далее.

Теперь несколько слов о хардкор-моде. Я не скажу, что он какой-то прям ультра сложный, скорее наоборот, он достаточно простой. Для начала стоит отметить, что я не фанат таких вот перепрохождений игры с доп. условиями и люблю получать все ачивки за одно прохождение, но это ещё ладно. В хардкорном режиме есть платные сохранения, которые тратят огнива (которых стало в разы меньше). Плюсом ко всему прочему теперь возможно умереть из-за очень низкого уровня рассудка. Это просто максимально растягивает и без того не самое интересно повторное прохождение игры. Особенно, когда ты вынужден стоять и ждать восстановления уровня рассудка возле свечи/факела/окна. Я знаю, что из игры вырезали расходник под названием ""отрезвин"", который мог восполнить уровень рассудка (как опиум здоровье). Отчасти я согласен с разработчиками, что он был вырезан из нормальной сложности. Однако, хочу отметить, что в хард-моде тот же опий не имеет смысла, так как монстры (тени) убивают игрока с одного удара, а какие-либо другие травмы получить до смерти - это ещё нужно постараться.

В общем, несмотря на небольшие недостатки по поводу достижений, игра очень классная и её смело можно назвать классикой жанра хоррор. Рекомендую поиграть в нее всем любителям мрака, отличной атмосферы, а также интересной и насыщенной истории. | Очень классная игра, графика конечно старая, но игре очень много лет как никак, не особо страшная советую к покупке и прохождению. 

100% | Many good things are well presented in this game, but the bad things are also obvious. Amnesia: The Dark Descent is ""a puzzle game"" with a horror theme; not a horror game with puzzles as a side dish. So, if you are a brain-dead person (like me), you are surely not going to make it through this game without a guide as the game gives you very little direction.

The atmosphere is terrific. The sound and character designs are well done. I really like all the elements of this game. However, bad things still exist. First of all, in this game, when the sanity drops, the screen becomes blurry, causing motion sickness and destroying your eyesight; this is very bad, even an FPS gamer like me can barely tolerate it. Secondly, dying makes the game easier; this is a very bad concept for me. Besides these, it is actually a good game. | Playing Amnesia: The Dark Descent in 2025 was an eye-opening experience. Despite its age, it stands tall among modern horror games. The gameplay feels polished, with physics-based interactions that remain impressive. While I’m not the biggest fan of puzzles, the game strikes a great balance. They’re neither too easy nor too hard, and they’re tied to the narrative in ways that make solving them rewarding.

The story is the heart of the game, delivered in a way that’s mysterious and compelling. It kept me curious throughout, as every note and memory revealed critical details. Paying close attention to the story isn’t just enriching, it’s essential. The narrative is layered with meaning, and small decisions can impact the outcome significantly.

While the game isn’t overwhelmingly scary, perhaps due to my higher scare tolerance, the tension is palpable. The NPCs are faster than you, so running is often your only option. This mechanic, coupled with the eerie atmosphere, keeps you on edge. One standout feature is the immediate feedback when solving puzzles, which subtly confirms you’re on the right track without breaking immersion.

It’s funny to think I discovered this classic through PewDiePie years ago. The rich story, creative gameplay, and immersive design make it a must-play, even today. Modern horror games could learn a lot from Amnesia’s creativity and depth.

Rating: 9/10. Playing it in 2025 was absolutely worth the time. | Не рекомендую 👎
Долго думал как оценить игру по достоинству, но после двойного прохождения основной игры + DLC и всех ачивок всё стало однозначно. Изначально я давал фору ведь у игры большая фан база,огромные оценки и вышла она в 2010 году, но вспомнил что в это время вышли Mafia 2, Mass Effect 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Heavy Rain,CoD:MW2 достойна ли она находится среди таких культовых игр?Есть ощущение что оценки сильно завышены из-за ностальгии,разберем по фактам сюжет-в начале слегка интригует на деле бессмысленная глупая графомания, графика  в момент выхода на 2010 уже была устаревшей, физика-отличная приятна как в HL2 возможно даже чуть лучше но какой смысл если её удалить ничего не изменится, все локации скучные однообразные и не запоминающиеся, так же скрипты (они везде) просто мобов спавнит где хочет,а отворачиваешься на секунду и он исчез.DLC-это отвратительное абсурдное идиотское убожество в которое что бы зайти надо читать гайды и к сожалению пройти меня заставили ачивки. Про ачивки я тоже ничего хорошего сказать не могу, тебя принуждают пройти линейный хоррор 2 раза ну вот зачем такую глупость добавлять,в общем не пойму чем многим запала в душу игра, возможно сюжетом раскинутым на 300 записочек и скриптовыми мобами а может чем то другим. Лучше поиграйте в Outlast, Alien: Isolation, Soma, Call of Cthulhu:Dark Corners of the Earth первые игры которые пришли в голову."

A smart and engaging game, perfect for a quick but enjoyable experience. | The Deed ist ein absolutes Kleinod, eine versteckte Perle und war für mich das Spiel des Jahres 2024 (in dem ich es sehr verspätet entdeckt habe).

Trotz weniger Handlungsmöglichkeiten überraschend komplex und sehr spannend - obwohl man selbst als Täter eigentlich genau weiß, was passiert ist. 
Für die paar Cent wurde ich mehrere Stunden ganz ausgezeichnet unterhalten.

Ein einziger Punkt hat mich gestört: Nach den ersten zwei, drei Durchläufen sind einige Dialoge bekannt und ich hätte sie gern übersprungen. Das hektische Weiterklicken führt aber leider fast immer zur Auswahl einer Dialogoption, die ich nicht wollte - und damit ist oft der ganze weitere Durchlauf hinfällig (da man den Tatvorwurf ziemlich exakt vorbereiten muss)... das zwang zu unnötigen Lese- und Wartepausen. 

Und denkt daran: Wenn euch euer eigentlich verhasster Bruder besucht, seinen nassen Regenmantel partout nicht ausziehen will und dann plötzlich noch der Besen verschwunden ist... bringt euch schnell in Sicherheit! | Графика оставляет желать лучшего. Простая двухмерная стилизация выглядит старомодно, что, конечно, не мешает игре, но и не добавляет ей значимой привлекательности.

Плюсы

✅ Короткая продолжительность:
Игра не занимает много времени, и если вам хочется быстро пройти головоломку, The Deed вполне подходит для кратковременного развлечения.

✅ Некоторые интересные моменты:
Игра может предложить пару действительно увлекательных ситуаций, где нужно принимать нестандартные решения или разгадывать головоломки.

Минусы
❌ Повторяемость и однообразие:
Проблема The Deed заключается в том, что игра быстро становится однообразной. Решения не приводят к значительным изменениям в истории, а головоломки — к довольно простым задачам, что делает процесс игры скучным.

❌ Отсутствие развития сюжета:
Сюжет очень плоский и не раскрывается должным образом. 

❌ Примитивная графика:
Графика выглядит устаревшей, и не добавляет атмосферы, которая могла бы сделать игру более погружающей и интригующей.

❌ Малое влияние решений на игру:
Решения, которые вы принимаете, на самом деле не сильно изменяют ход игры, что делает игру менее интересной и повторяющейся.

Итоговая оценка: ⭐ 3 из 10

76561198012450682,429570,The Walking Dead: Michonne - A Telltale Miniseries,7.3,Adventure,21,"The Walking Dead: Michonne — игра от студии Telltale Games из трёх эпизодов, в которой мы следуем за одной из самых популярных героинь комикса и сериала, Мишонн. Несмотря на первоначальные надежды, игра вызывает разочарование, оставляя много вопросов неотвеченными и предоставляя геймплей, который вряд ли запомнится долго.

[h1]Сюжет и атмосфера[/h1]
История игры происходит между 126-ым и 139-ым выпусками комикса, когда Мишонн отсутствовала в сюжете. Игроки ожидают увидеть, что она пустилась в долгое плавание, а вместо этого впуталась в конфликт с ворами. К сожалению, ход событий очевиден и не удивляет: с самого начала понятно, что Мишонн выживет и справится с угрозами.

Эпизоды наполнены галлюцинациями главной героини, что лишь добавляет путаницы. Мишонн видит своих детей в кошмарах и страдает от страхов, которые не оправданы для выбранного периода сюжета. В комиксе у неё не проявляются такие психические потрясения, что вызывает критику сценарного выбора разработчиков.

[h1]Геймплей и нелинейность[/h1]
Главная проблема заключается в отсутствии нелинейности. Игрокам предлагаются выборы, которые, в конечном итоге, не имеют значимых последствий. Даже важные решения, как обмен заложниками, превращаются в простую сцену, не имеющую влияния на общее развитие истории. Такое ограничение делает игру предсказуемой и однообразной.

[h1]Персонажи и эмоции[/h1]
Персонажи в игре оставляют желать лучшего, многие из них не выделяются и не оставляют следа в памяти. Неестественные диалоги и дубовая озвучка лишь усугубляют впечатления. Мишонн сама не вызывает эмоций, а отсутствие актрисы-озвучки из сериала лишает игру ещё одного уровня аутентичности.

[h1]Техническая сторона и графика[/h1]
Графика игры остаётся на уровне предыдущих проектов Telltale, что, учитывая развитие технологий, кажется недостаточным. Смена технического стиля не улучшается, и вся игра ощущается устаревшей с визуальной точки зрения.

[h1]Заключение[/h1]
The Walking Dead: Michonne предлагает игрокам короткометражное приключение, не добавляющее ничего нового ни в историю, ни в опыт комиксов или сериалов про Мишонн. Это печальный пример избыточного повторения и лишенных эмоций диалогов, показывающий, что Telltale подошли к своему проекту без вдохновения. Учитывая все недостатки, это прямо отражается на скуке игры.

Overall : 2,8/5, Okay | Yan bir seri olmasına rağmen, yapımcılar yine ortaya harika bir iş çıkarmış.

The concept and story had so much potential but was poorly executed, the narration wasn't interesting, the tasks didn't always make sense, sometimes it was difficult to figure out what step logically came next, it seemed like some dialogue/clues were missing when you clicked something that required an action, there was a lot of backtracking (thank goodness for the map and quick travel!), the bonus chapter was absolute nonsense, I saw some basic spelling errors, some of the mini games were horrendous, and while some of the hidden object scenes were unique and good, others were frustrating. This all detracted from how much fun the game was. If you can tolerate and persevere with the trickier hidden object scenes and mini games, then it's not bad to get 100% achievements (use a guide for the collectables as you won't want to play it again!), but it's still a relatively short HOG (3 hours).

Wrath of the Dead Rabbit,0.0,Action,0,"Played this game on and off since its release, just beat it, and let me say, its not worth it. very obnoxious floaty controls, the whole warioware kill gimmick facilitates a bunch of shitty bullet sponges. There are ton of weapons but very few enemies worth using them on. Stylish i guess, but man why did i need to finish this game? | Un gran juego de mi adolescencia. En general es muy divertido. Controlar al personaje en la rueda se siente bien. Aunque cuando hay que hacer plataformeo se siente medio tosco. A la hora de usar al personaje caminando es incluso más tosco. Pero el plataformeo es mínimo así que no le doy importancia.
Usar las armas también es muy divertido, pero el juego tiene un problema de balanceo muy grande. Esto se debe a la tercera mejora de cualquiera de los dos tipos de armas (particularmente las de misiles combinada con la escopeta). Te vuelves demasiado roto al punto de que el jefe final acaba siendo extremadamente fácil. Es por esa razón que el juego agrega muchísimos insta-kills por todos lados. Esta es la manera del juego de agregar dificultad. No sé, se siente medio feo.
Al matar a un monstruo, juegas un pequeño minijuego. Y estos son pintorescos. Son un detalle más para agregarle más carisma al juego. Sin embargo, creo que hay muy pocos. Te terminas cansando de ver los mismos minijuegos una y otra vez. A veces tienen leves variaciones en los gráficos pero nada muy wow.
Los visuales son...algo baratos. El artstyle en general se ve bien, pero las animaciones no tanto. Se nota más que nada en los minijuegos al matar a un monstruo. Algunas cosas apenas están animadas y se sienten como si agarraras una imagen en Paint y la mueves con el mouse.
Hay muy poco que hacer en el post-game. Solo hacer las misiones secundarias, revelar todo el mapa y desbloquear los sombreritos restantes con la isla. Desearía que hubiera más ya que siento que los juegos de este estilo de exploración deberían tener otra cosa. No sé, historias secundarias, monstruos secretos, new game plus, algo.
Divertido juego en general. Le vendría bien un remake o mejor aún una secuela que mejore en todos los aspectos que mencioné. | literal meu jogo de infância, e mesmo depois de tanto tempo ainda continua bom

Então adeus AdVenture Communist :v | As of 1/24/17, this game has become MUCH more playable. Comrades are still a part of the game, but they don't accumulate NEARLY as slow as before. There have been numerous, helpful research trial and experiment improvements added, which aid progression even further. The only downside I can think of is that scientists may be a little too easy to stockpile. You only need to 5 to activate the Comrade x7777 trial, which is one of the main reasons why progression has improved. I would either slim down a few achievement scientist awards, or make the x7777 trial a bit more costly. Aside from that, it's gotten a lot better.

This game was virtually unplayable, at a point, for nearly 2 months, but now, it's fallen back on my radar. It's nearly as fun progressing here as it is in AdCap. I'm curious to see what they'll do next. | Adventure Communist, it sounds weird, it might be a little weird, but it's good.

As a developer the mechanics of this game are solid and have a good amount of depth. Even after a year of on again and off again I can find this game to be enjoyable and pleasently engaging. 

The only Con I can credit to Idling to rule the gods are the grammatical errors and misspelled words. In one chapter it is almost incomprehensible. However, that does not detract from the overall game as a brilliant game in the idling genre. | This is absolutely the best Idle game I have yet encountered.   Seriously.

It's free and fun, and definitely not pay to win(you can pay in a little for boosts to support the devs, but it never feels required). | Tiene una gran idea base, pero la interfaz y la claridad del juego son algo complejas, abrumadoras y llegan a ser aburridoras.

Nota 10/8.5 | Welcome to a top down apocalyptic cartoonish survival game from german developer vidiludi who can be found here http://www.vidiludi.com/

Most of the negative reviews on Steam can be summed up into three major spits...

1) A mediocre survival game based on the fact that there is currently limited longevity for many people because there are very few achievements, it has an easy levelling up system, and a low amount of rare and super rare resources. Granted its not early access, but the single developer/team have by no means finished with it adding more and more content in fairly frequent allotments throughout each year. Currently they are working on money quests among other assortment of goodies. So why would you give a game a negative review based on the fact that it's current state is mediocre when there is beyond a shadow of a doubt a huge potential of fun for gamers, especially those who like to make video's? It seems the real problem is some gamers lack imagination and how to have fun.

2) The game was once free and now it is not. This is true, the developer made a risky move to try and get more people to look at his game by making the content free for a period of time. He also added hat and skin cases which are obtainable by doing quests in game and through a micro transaction of a dollar be unlocked, or sold on the steam marketplace instead. However he soon realised that making the content free had a two edged sword about it, on the one hand while it made people more aware of his product, it also allowed in a huge herd of immature trolls that flourished at the expense of others. These trolling kiddies were equally demanding in the discussion board and on the developer himself voicing in a nearly temper tantrum fashion there every whine and lame brained 'I want it now' requests. One therefore can quickly sympathise with the developer why he has wisely moved the game to a very affordable customer bracket who are more likely to appreciate the hard work that the developer has already placed in the game. Also why would you criticise a game for being a dollar when you can clearly just keep collecting hat cases and sell them on the market?

3) I was trolled. My body was driven over several times as a speed bump and my back pack of goodies was stolen and used against my body in a most ungodly fashion, then they blew up my car and placed meat where my dead body was to encourage dogs to come and lick the ground. All I can say to this is toughen up cupcake, its survival dammit. The developer can hardly be blamed for your thighs being too flabby to run from impending danger. Stop eating all those candy bars frequently scattered in all those apocalyptic loot crates.

However, it is true your experience with this game and whether it will be an overall positive or negative one is really more dependent on you and how smart you play. The story of the game is simply survival. You the player are immune from the virus, but the zombies and the gun totting NPC's with gasmasks are not immune and are quickly designed to attack you as they also want to survive. It's not actually easy for another person to kill you. Oh sure they can drive over you, but that's not as easy as it may sound. They can't actually just shoot you either. Each person has a 100% Karma level, only if your Karma level goes down can they start firing at you. Your Karma level will start to drop as soon as you start attacking someone's wall or base, then it's suddenly opening firing range. This means you can defend your base quite easily if your base is being attacked, but they can't shoot you as you haven't been destroying anyone's walls.

Unlike other survival games which demand constant logging in daily, this one has a mechanic which allows a person to leave the game for a long period without the need of again having to start the whole thing from scratch. While it is true that your structures dilapidates with time, items that you have buried in game remain there unless someone uncovers them with a shovel. As long as you keep count of the secret place you have buried your stash, unless discovered by someone by accident it should remain where you buried it, allowing you again to start off with the items you have thus far accumulated. Even with the developers constant upgrades to the game your hidden stash remains safe. It is therefore this mechanic of not having to start the whole thing again from scratch and its relatively stress free nature that makes this apocalyptic game seriously attractive and a fun romp for many.

There are many things to learn, here are a few good hints to get you started.

'Get in the habit of accumulating stuff and burying it. Carrying all your good stuff with you in your back pack is just asking for trouble when you die'.

'If you have steak in your backpack a wandering dog may in fact eat your whole backpack making you lose everything. Fish, drinks are a great alternative'.

'Always make sure you have bandages on you and antibiotics, cloths make bandages quickly.'

'Never bury your good stash within your base. If people break into your base it will be the first place they look. Instead make sure it’s outside a relatively good walking distance from your base to make it harder to locate'.

'If you place a steak underneath a car and wait a while a collection of dogs will come scavenging for the meat they can't reach. Feed each dog individually and you will be rewarded with an army of dogs.'

'Tesla coils can be sniped through windows, make sure your windows are boarded up too'.

I could go on and on about various tips and tricks you could do. Below is a fairly long play through of the game which I intend to add to over the upcoming weeks. We go about trolling other bases and players to show what and what not to do. What’s up so far should be enough for you to see if you would enjoy this game. Have fun, stay safe, and be friendly...

Lest euch die Tags durch und ihr werdet sehen, dass wir ein Open-World-Zombie-Überlebens-Coop-Spiel haben.

Basebau, Loot, Fahrzeuge, NPC's und Tiere, sowie einige Zombies. Ein einfaches aber sehr übersichtliches Craftingsmenü. Steam-Erfolge und Charakterentwicklung. Alles vorhanden. Übrigens, lasst euch nicht von der MMO und Mehrspielergeschichte abschrecken, das Spiel ist problemlos mit einem lokalen Server (alleine) spielbar und macht auch dann Spaß. Oder vielleicht im lokalen Coop mit ein paar Freunden? Alles drin.

Die Grafik und der isometrische Spielstil ist Geschmacksache. Mir gefällt er sehr gut. 

Die/der Entwickler ist in den Diskussionen sehr aktiv und geht auf Wünsche und Ideen der Spieler ein. So sollte Early Access auch sein.

Wenn-

- die Karte ein wenig größer wird,
- die Charaktererstellung ein wenig individualisiert werden kann (wobei es echt coole visuelle Gimmicks wie Mützen, Westen , Schuhe usw. gibt); Stichwort weibliche Charaktere,
- die Balance der Waffen und Gegner ein wenig angepasst wird,

dann wird dieses Spiele eine runde und lustige Sache nicht nur für nebenbei.

Für mich bereits jetzt 3 von 5 Sternen, Tendenz steigend, und eine Kaufempfehlung für alle, die keine Lust mehr auf First Person Überleben haben.

P.S.: Welches Early Access Spiel kann in einer so frühen Phase mit 10 übersetzten Sprachen auftrumpfen? Noch ein Pluspunkt."

76561198012450682,531640,Eternal Card Game,0.31666666666666665,"Casual, Massively Multiplayer, Strategy, Free To Play",0,"I've played Magic on and off my whole life and spent at least 1000 hours playing Hearthstone. I had MTGO since the very beginning, and Hearthstone since late 2013 near the end of the open beta. Eternal is the best online card game I've ever played. It combines the best aspects of Magic's strategic depth and Hearthstone's fast-paced accessibility while avoiding their flaws.
F2P
Magic will always be expensive because it's a tradable CCG with a reserve list of cards that can't be reprinted and expensive booster packs. Most cards lose tons of value when they rotate out of standard. MTGO is less expensive and more liquid than physical cards, but still expensive. Recently, Wizards have added features similar to other digital CCGs like treasure chests.
Hearthstone is ""F2P"" in name only. New players need to spend lots of money or time to earn a viable deck. Otherwise, enjoy scraping out wins with a crappy pile at rank 17. Rewards for winning games are meager. You can get big payoffs in Arena (where you don't get to keep the cards you draft)...if you're already an experienced player and/or lucky. Arena costs 1.5 packs to play with cards you don't own and win at least 1 pack of value. You don't keep the cards. New Arena players get trashed.
Eternal is truly F2P. The spoils of victory are frequent and generous. Each win either gives a treasure chest with gold and a card, or more gold and a better card, or even more gold holy shit and a booster pack. Each treasure chest has a chance of becoming a better treasure chest full of even better rewards. Single-player Gauntlet mode lets you face the AI for free to win big rewards. Forge and Draft are more expensive than HS Arena (2.5 and 5x pack price vs. 1.5x pack price), but you get to keep all the cards you draft in Forge and Draft modes while still winning big payoffs for playing well.
Magic is pay to play, try to recoup your losses later. Hearthstone is an evil slot machine that reluctantly hands out the goods. Eternal is a slot machine that always gives you something, but sometimes gives you something better, and occasionally gives you an all-expenses-paid trip to Hawaii.
Winner: Eternal
Gameplay and RNG
Magic is the deepest, most complicated, most strategically interesting CCG ever. Almost every type of card, zone and resource can be interacted with, during both players' turns. The mana system rewards intelligent deck building and decision making skills. However, the mana system has also been a constant thorn in its side. Mana screw and flood as well as color screw are a necessary evil of the game's design, and consistently ruin the experience and decide high-level matches. The mulligan system punishes you further for the crime of being unlucky. Magic Online makes no use of any digital-only design space (except Momir Basic) and the relief from shuffling physical cards. The metagame gets patched several times a year whenever the physical Banned and Restricted list is updated.
Hearthstone sidesteps resource problems with its mana system, but has different issues instead. It's a simplistic ""My turn, your turn"" game with a hard limit to how interesting and interactive it can be. The mana system means that instead of getting mana-screwed, you get tempo-screwed if you don't draw a 2 on turn 2, a 3 on turn 3, and so on. It's called Curvestone for a reason. Being able to attack anything directly means that losing the board first usually means losing the game. The mulligan system is good. Hearthstone explores digital design space, but leans overwhelmingly on random effects. The RNG is so hilariously pervasive that even top-level players meme about it on a constant basis. Omnipresent powerful random effects make situations that are impossible to play around. It's one thing to get outplayed, but it feels awful to get outlucked. HS is the game of getting outlucked. Also, the meta is prone to getting extremely stale as Team 5 moves very slowly to nerf problem cards and very rarely buffs weaker ones.
Eternal simplifies the essence of Magic's strategic, interactive gameplay. You can still interact on your opponents' turns and there's plenty of powerful spot and mass removal (at common and uncommon, even!) to deal with tall and wide boards. The mana and combat systems are similar to Magic's. Eternal mitigates bad opening hands by allowing you to redraw a 7 card hand with between 2-5 mana cards, guaranteed. Flood and screw are still possible, but not nearly as frequently as in Magic. The combat system is much more interesting less blatantly aggressive than Hearthstone's, with different advantages given for attackers and defenders. Eternal makes excellent use of digital design space. You can affect cards in any zone, some cards make copies of themselves when drawn, and card attributes will persist across different zones, resulting in creative combos. As far as the metagame, in the last few months Dire Wolf Digital has shown a willingness to alter cards and tune up the meta in a timely manner when certain strategies are revealed to be too oppressive or lacking in counterplay.
Winner: Magic for overall depth, Eternal for elegance and creativity with digital space.
Polish and Features
Magic Online is the laughingstock of the digital games world. However, it has many more features than HS, with a huge variety of formats available, a full-featured collection and deck manager, and the ability to trade tickets cards with bots other players.
Hearthstone is a beautiful experience with compelling graphics, music, animations and voice acting. However, it possesses a few game modes (casual, ranked, arena, tavern brawl) with only two formats for now (wild and tavern brawl). It possesses extremely few features despite its obscene profitability and years post-release. There is no tournament mode and the deck and collection managers are very weak.
Eternal's art direction, sound design and graphical effects are better than Magic Online (like every other game) and worse than Hearthstone's (like every other game), but far closer to Hearthstone than to Magic Online. It only has two single player and two multiplayer modes. It has an intuitive, full-featured collection manager and deckbuilder with analytic tools to help guide deckbuilding.
Winner: Hearthstone for polish, Eternal for features.
Verdict
On the whole, Eternal refines and simplifies Magic's gameplay and creatively explores new design space while avoiding the egregious errors of Hearthstone. The gameplay finely balances a majority focus on skill with a pinch of luck. There is a wealth of interactions and strategies to explore. The online experience is elegant, enjoyable and full-featured. The game is generous with its rewards. You should stop reading this and install it right now. Why are you still reading this? Go away. Go play Eternal | Quick Review: Great Magic: The Gathering inspired digital CCG. Amazing UI, loads of features, brilliant draft system, and some truly awesome cards. But... as an MTG derivative, you have to be able to accept mana flooding/screwing.

Long Review:

I wanted to put some good hours into the game before reviewing (18 as of this post). I've completed the Tutorial Quests, four Forges, one draft and a ton of ranked games. Oh, and I've been playing Magic since Arabian Nights and Hearthstone since Beta.

To start, this is NOT Hearthstone. It is Magic the Gathering. Everything you know from Hearthstone doesn't apply here. You have to play ""power"" cards (mana/lands), so you need to know how to balance a deck. The system will try to do it for you and they start you out with a full set of 40 ""dual stones"", but to be good at the game you'll need to understand how to get the proper ratios. You also don't choose how you attack. You choose WHO attacks, and the opponent chooses blocks.

Once you accept that this is Magic on digitial steroids, you can really enjoy the game. Note: the initial tutorial quests are drudgery. Your decks suck and the mana ratios aren't great. They should really let you skip parts of this, but they don't. JUST PLAY THROUGH. It's worth it. You'll get a free Forge, which will net you a solid amount of packs and get you going.

The UI is AMAZING. You can get through games in 5 minutes and there is almost no waiting. Everything just works like you expect it to. WotC should hang its head in shame after seeing this.

There are a ton of cards for a first launch and lots of interesting deck ideas to build around. You could say that there are some balance issues - Black has a ridiculous suite of creature removal for a core set - but overall it does feel like every color have something truly special that it can do, and there are solid Aggro, Control and Combo strategies.

While I still love Hearthstone, I've been finding myself coming back to Eternal again and again, excited to play more. It's awesome and will be enjoyed by anyone who has played and enjoyed Magic at any time in their life. | Surement l'un des meilleurs, si ce n'est le meilleur jeu de cartes actuellement disponible sur le marché.

Il combine à lui seul tous les avantages qui sont présents sur ses concurrents directs. 

Ici il a très peu de places au RNG (comprenez à la chance), bien sûr il y en aura toujours sur ce type de jeu puisque cela reste un tirage sur plusieurs dizaines de cartes et si une carte tombe au bon moment dans une partie qui semble perdue cela peu la renversée.

Aspect également important, c'est que c'est un vrai free to play. On peut vite obtenir des cartes du seul Set disponible à l'heure actuelle. Tu farmes, tu suis les quêtes journalières, tu seras récompensé. Pour ceux qui détestent l'aspect versus contre d'autres joueurs, il existe des modes exclusifs contre l'IA (vous contre l'ordi en somme). C'est très intéressant pour des joueurs débutants qui veulent prendre leur temps sur chacun de leurs tours. Ici pas de chronomètre si vous mettez trop de temps a joué pour vous mettre la pression !

Seul point qui peut rebuter les joueurs non anglophones, le jeu n'est pas traduit en français a l'heure actuelle, mais rien de dramatique en cherchant un peu avec google tu vas pouvoir t'en sortir petit geek ! | + A interface é muito boa e intuitiva (cópia descarada do hearthstone);
- Uns diriam que o jogo é pay-to-win, mas quando na verdade é um pay-to-play como acontece em TODO cardgame da categoria, você não ganha por pagar mais, você paga para ter as cartas e ganha se souber jogar;
+ O jogo possibilita grindar as cartas muito facilmente, você ganha gold rápido além de ganhar cartas a cada vitória;
+ Os boosters vem com 12 cartas sendo uma delas rara/lendária, sendo assim você consegue fechar um playset de cartas de raridade mais baixa muito rápido, tendo que se preocupar apenas com as 'caras';
+ Existem MUITAS mecânicas e interações baseadas em magic, tornando o jogo muito mais competitivo e menos randômico (bom pra quem odeia o RNG do hearthstone);
+ Existem cartas chamadas 'fast spells' que são o equivalente das 'mágicas instantâneas' do magic, estas cartas possibilitam jogadas de resposta durante o turno do oponente;
+ Durante o combate, os jogadores escolhem apenas se atacam e com quais criaturas eles atacam, o jogador defensor escolhe se bloqueia e com quais criaturas ele bloqueia (semelhante ao mágic, diferente do hearthstone), ao meu ver isso possibilita a presença de mais criaturas de utilidade no deck (que possuem algum tipo de efeito que não seja apenas voltado ao combate) e meio que exige cartas de resposta do oponente para tais criaturas (removals), além disso as criaturas 'regeneram' o dano no final de cada turno, assim como acontece no magic;
+ O tutorial inicial do jogo é muito bom (não é nem um pouco chato) e te mostra boa parte das mecânicas além de te presentear com boas cartas, no final do tutorial você já ganha um deck de uma facção (cada deck já vem com uma lendária e o deck da facção das sombras tem uma lendária muito boa);

Só jogando pra ver mesmo, tanto para os jogadores de magic, quanto para os jogadores de hearthstone fica a dica deste jogo ;) | Jedna z większych niespodzianek wśród rosnącego ostatnio bardzo rynku karcianek. Spodziewałem się kolejnej karcianki a'la Hearthstone a tu taka niespodzianka! Dla mnie HS odpychał zbyt bardzo casualem, tutaj mamy już głebie zaczerpniętą z MtG. Tak dobrze słyszycie ta gra to wyśmienite połączenie Hearthstone z królem karcianek jakim jest Magic the Gathering. Oprócz standardowych trybów znanych z konkurencyjnych tytułów błyszczy szczególnie dobrze zanany fanom MTG tryb Draft. Najlepsze w tym trybie jak i trybie Forge(odpowiednik HS'owego ""drafta"") jest to, że karty które wybieramy dostajemy na zawsze!!! Inne plusy to duża ilość kart, możliwość tworzenia decków o dużej synergii na wzór też tych znanych nam z MTG, nie mamy wrażenia składania po prostu mocnych kart w jedną talie jak w HS. Gra mimo fazy wczesnego dostępu ma bardzo dużo contentu i jest ciągle rozwijana. Dodatkowo duża liczba graczy jaki, prężnie rozwijające się community tej gry powoduje, że wieszcze jej świetlaną przyszłość. Dajcie tej grze szanse a nie pożałujecie !!!"

Вообще я люблю, когда в подобных проектах добавляют новых игровых персонажей, да и Хави мне понравился, как протагонист куда больше, чем Клементина (жду когда закидают камнями). Пусть игровой процесс не слишком длинный, очень жаль, но мне абсолютно все понравилось - и персонажи, и сюжет, и более комфортный геймплей, чем в предыдущих частях. Атмосферно, да и визуальный стиль подтянули хорошо. | [hr][/hr]
[h1]Общая оценка игры[/h1]
8.7 из 10 (Отлично)
[h1]Сюжет[/h1] 
Продолжает мрачную историю выживания в мире, охваченном зомби-апокалипсисом. Игрок берет на себя роль Хавьера Гарсии, бывшего профессионального бейсболиста, который оказывается втянутым в драматическую борьбу за выживание вместе со своей семьей. На фоне смертельной угрозы окружающих зомби и противостояния между враждующими группировками выстраиваются сложные отношения между персонажами.
Одной из ключевых тем игры становится тема выбора между семьей и моральным долгом перед сообществом. В центре внимания также оказывается юная Клементина, которая здесь продолжает развиваться как самостоятельный и сильный персонаж.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3422443369
[h1]Геймплей[/h1] 
Игра сохраняет привычную механику интерактивного кино, характерную для предыдущих частей серии. Основу геймплея составляют диалоги с возможностью выбора реплик, которые влияют на развитие сюжета и отношения между персонажами. Ключевые элементы: эпизодические Quick Time Events (QTE) — моменты, где нужно вовремя нажимать кнопки для выполнения действий, исследование локаций и поиск интерактивных предметов и эмоциональные моральные дилеммы, заставляющие задуматься над каждым выбором. Каждое принятое решение может иметь далеко идущие последствия, что подчеркивает значимость действий игрока.
[h1]Графика[/h1] 
Графический стиль игры выполнен в узнаваемой комиксной стилистике, которая перекликается с визуальным стилем оригинального графического романа The Walking Dead. Несмотря на отсутствие фотореалистичной детализации, яркие цветовые контрасты и тщательно прорисованные персонажи создают атмосферу напряженности и безысходности. Анимация движений и мимики персонажей значительно улучшилась по сравнению с ранними играми серии. Однако на старых платформах могут встречаться небольшие баги и падение производительности.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3422446839
[h1]Особенности[/h1] 
1)  Влияние выбора: решения игрока определяют не только концовку, но и развитие сюжета в каждом эпизоде.
2)  Возвращение Клементины: важного персонажа предыдущих частей, что радует давних поклонников серии.
3)  Драматический сюжет: эмоционально насыщенная история с яркими персонажами и неожиданными поворотами.
4)  Новая группа героев: знакомство с интересными новыми персонажами, такими как Хавьер и его семья.
5)  Кинематографичная подача: сцены с напряженными моментами и эффектными кат-сценами.
[h1]Мнение[/h1]
В целом, The Walking Dead: A New Frontier— это превосходное продолжение серии, которое сочетает в себе глубокий сюжет, интересных персонажей и захватывающий геймплей. Она обязательна к прохождению для всех поклонников жанра и любителей качественных интерактивных историй.

[hr][/hr] | I really liked the game, although in some places the story was confusing and the narrative was lost.
An easy game to get 100% of the achievements, all you need is just follow the story.
However, it took me [u]8 hours[/u] to complete all 5 chapters (not too much, not too little). But the problem was that many of the choices were very one-sided. Most of the characters were not remembered at all, they simply did not have time to open up or their thinking did not suit them at all, the most memorable moment from the game is literally the beginning, *spoiler*  [spoiler]when Mariana with a smile on her face takes a bullet to the head from the bushes [/spoiler].
 Everyone is biased and aggressive towards Clementine, even when there is no obvious reason for it.
btw... The developers made [u]Clementine a secondary character[/u], whose character was built on the basis of the decisions made in the first two seasons.
In the end, even though Clem isn't the main character, the choice is still made in favor of her comfort, because the character is already like family to us, so it's quite possible to kill off all the main characters of the season, as long as she stays alive. The statistics screen at the end of each episode even confirms my point of view to some extent. | [h1]  История какого-то мужика отталкивает тебя от игры? Фатальная ошибка! [/h1]
При первой встречи с Клем я был так рад увидеть ее подросшей, видя ее историю и принимая в ней косвенное участие она воспринималась дочкой, которая впитывала все как губка. Я думал, что буду подстраиваться под нее, чтобы так сказать не ставить ей преград на пути, но главный герой - Хави мне понравился, он оказался по истине интересным мужиком со своими бедами.
Его история раскрывает отношения братьев, семьи в широком смысле, дружбы и разумеется любви. Ни за что не стану рассказывать об этом в обзоре, потому что это ахuительно интересно. Серьезно, это было прекрасно, я буквально еле отрывался от игры. 
Сколько не играй в ходячих, а выбор тяжелее от серии к серии, разработчики не дают тебе заскучать, отвлекаться от раздумий над очередным выбором. За это я не перестану любить эту серию игр. 
Приобретайте и наслаждайтесь, я уверен что оно действительно стоит того | It's nice to see Clementine again!

You start by inviting people to join your quest party. Many of the people lie on their profiles and some characters hate your other members so much that they quit right away.

Every quest has multiple events in which you need to select one characters idea how to solve them. For example you encounter a vampire. Will you send a) the Vegan to talk to him about being vegan b) the drunk to talk about drinking c) or the bro who says he got this as he had to watch vampire movies with his ex. Results might not be what you expect.

I strongly recommend QUESTR not as a game but as entertainment."

[h1]Negative:[/h1]
Controls and how the character responds to my inputs suck. Sometimes he can't start running on the first try or does it with a delay if he's close to an interactive object. Why? I don't know.
During battles, it literally kills me (but just in the game). The target-assist system always sucks, but if you get punished for targeting the wrong enemy, it makes you suffer because you might not even do it, but you still get punished just because that's how the game works.
The time stop after every hit is... I don't find this a good idea, but okay. The worst part is that you get a longer time stop if you land a ""perfect"" hit. And that just breaks the whole process. I wanna f**king SCREAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM how bad it is. Sometimes my character just stands still, literally, while I spam my buttons, even when not in time stop. Maybe it's some ""interesting mechanic,"" I don't know, but it makes everything worse. I wanna cry in that moment, literally.
And I have a problem with grabs, the most powerful action in this game. Just when I want to grab, my character goes into this ""AFK"" state. Maybe I just can't get used to it, and it's my skill issue, but it's still not intuitive and not friendly.
Narrator is boring.

[b]Spoiler:[/b]
[spoiler]In one scenario, the protagonist was kissed by a cat, but after he was killed, before he died completely, he realized that she loves him. So, okay, what truth did I get? I got the truth that the bunny is a traitor, of course he is, but why did they add the part where she kisses him and confesses her feelings? Just for what? I still need to figure out the truth about her feelings. That's frustrating. This sucks.[/spoiler]
[h1]General things / Neutral:[/h1]
Choices without choices: the problem with every game that claims to have ""choices."" They never give you real freedom, not even within the ""game borders."" Thankfully, we have fixed 4 choices for each ending (I don't know about the ""truth""), because I don't need to predict my last choice. But still, I can't relate to what it is MY choice and not the protagonist's, because sometimes he does something I don't want him to do. That gives such a frustrating experience. But this is a story about someone else, not me, right? It's up to you, but I don't like it. Honestly, when he does what I want without additional choices, it feels really good. Thanks that this exists, not too often, but still.
Battles aren't hard; they made them similar to a beat 'em up, with the main focus on crowd control.
I didn't find this story is interesting. Like. So-so or even a little worse.

Thanks that I don't need to find every chest in the game to get my max-level swords and stones. Thanks that I don't need to grind for them. Thanks that I don't need to grind through every ending to get the ""truth,"" just 4 specific scenarios. Thanks that I don't need any levels for my character or items to beat the enemy. Thanks that the game still encourages me to be proactive and reactive enough in battle, and there is a reward for it (not a great one, but... still something). Interesting implementation of mouse controls where you need to click on the enemy. Lol, it's like playing a point-and-click action game, ha-ha.
And it's so cool that they even added a feature where, if you drop an enemy's shield while flying, it can stagger other enemies. That's awesome! And you can grab an enemy and use them as a live shield. | Não diria que eu aprovo nem reprovo esse jogo. Monótono demais, sem sal.

Eu me apliquei a pegar todos os achievements, mas pra fazer isso é um grind desgraçado, você tem que fazer todos os finais e ver os mesmos diálogos de novo e de novo toda vez, além de matar uma quantidade interminável de inimigos em batalhas exatamente iguais toda vez.

        本作的剧情围绕一个与世隔绝的学校展开，克莱曼婷在末世之中成为了一个足以独当一面的战士，同时AJ也在学习克莱曼婷的行为，学习着成为一个战士。本作对于末世中的生存压力较少刻画，转而探讨起末日中的道德法则，AJ在克莱曼婷的教导下发展出了自己的价值观，以血泪和苦痛的代价拥有了自己的生存信条，这是剧情着重刻画的。
另外，尽管小时候就看过老番茄做的视频，早就知道结局是什么，但是重来一遍，当我从旁观者变成玩家时，我还是会揪心，会祈祷，会感动得稀里哗啦的，我想这就是第九艺术的魅力吧，能让玩家做了这么一场梦，沉浸在那个并不美好的世界里，当我关掉游戏后还是怅然若失，带着完成一部大作之后的失落感，躺在了我的椅子上，我意识到我应该做些什么，于是我花了168买了一顶克莱曼婷的帽子。
其实像这种类型的游戏很有意思，置身事外的玩家我们，操纵着游戏中的角色，代替他们做出决定，但其实我们并不知道我们所作的决定到底是不是他们会做出的决定，到底是不是他们的人格会选择的道路，玩家的想法到底是不是角色的想法呢？玩家的选择到底是不是角色的选择呢？我理解角色吗？角色是为什么才会做出他们的选择呢?
我在游玩时总是会思考什么才是最优选项，怎样才能做到最好，选择我们心中自以为最正确的道路，为了刷角色的好感度而选择违背我本心的话，我努力编织起一个完美的梦，每一个方面追求最好，很多我所做的选择为了推进剧情，并非是我出于自身。但有时我又会出于自身扭曲（？）的性格做选择，我会出于无端的理由不选择和louis发展感情而去和violet发展感情，就像类似岳父不喜女婿那般的想法而去发展百合线，我会为了保住violet的手而让AJ陷身险境，会为了利用James说着讨好话，即使我根本不认同他的理念。所以我在玩这款游戏时我是自私的，我是只想着自己的。就像在做性格调查的时候，我们的选择形成了我们的人格，我们的人格其实是我们自己想看到的，自己所认为的性格，相比于所谓不可名状的克苏鲁古神，其实人对于自身才更像不可名状。
 这是一部带有独特魅力的作品，游戏的意义已经超越了其本身，感谢t社给予这部作品生生不息的生命力，很遗憾t社在18年倒闭，时隔七年未见续作，或许我们再也无法知晓克莱曼婷和AJ后面的故事，但依旧感谢游戏四部曲给我带来的震撼与感动，让我再次感受到了第九艺术的魅力。 | I love this game.

[h1]Об игре[/h1]
Мы играем за чернокожего астронавта по имени Одди, или Оддисеус Космос, который, в ожидании исследовательской группы, провел не один год на своем космическом корабле около черной дыры. Но наш герой оказался на этом корабле не один, а вместе с роботом Бартоном, или Бартон Квест.
Нашим героем не остается ничего делать, кроме как ждать, а еще следить за своим кораблем. Одди почти все время проводит в лаборатории, из которой ему просто лень выходить. А вот Бартон - очень правильный, что не явялется редкостью для многих роботов в фантастических романах - они всегда следуют правилам и укзазаниям своего хозяина. Но тут чуть наоборот - во время игры складывается ощущение, что робот руководит ученым, потому что дает ему различные задания.
Весь сюжет наполнен юмором, но иногда не смешным, хотя, это возможно лишь проблема играющего, который читает весь этот текст.
Перед нами классический представитель Point'n'Click квест. Изучаем локации огромного корабля, собираем различные предметы и используем их для наших целей. Держать на верном пути, давая задания, вас будет Бартон.
В этой игре по нажатию ""пробела"" будут показаны все интерактивыне элементы на локации.
Также в игре присустсвует красивая пиксельная графика и хорший саундтрек, который, почему-то, иногда просто перестает играть, пока не перезайдешь.

Эта игра заставит вас креативно мыслить. Ведь не каждый человек в здравом уме соединит провода с помощью вешалки из стальной проволоки.

У этой игры потрясающий сюжет и милые персонажи:
Квест - робот перфекционист

我开的是正常难度的档，游戏的前十个小时体验很好，但是到了中期，大量的重复性战斗充斥着游戏。即使是我这种再各种游戏中都比较喜欢战斗的玩家，在玩尸变纪元2的时候我满脑子都是想着“快点通关，快点结束”。

我在玩到15小时的时候就已经感觉到厌烦，但是为了看剧情我还是耐着性子玩到了39小时，结果再快到结局的时候我的角色第一次死亡然后告诉我游戏删档重开了？WTF？

Combat is incredibly addictive, the leveling system, the challenge progression, and the basebuilding are all great attributes. In Dead Age 2 I'd say the story can be a bit rough at times, it has good ideas but I don't think the author has quite perfected dialogue yet.

As YT reviewer said of Alien Romulus: ""I wondered if we have forgotten how to make movies!""

I was beginning to despair that perhaps we have forgotten how to make video games...until this.

It has been a very long time since I sat down to a game and could not stop playing for days!
This game on the laptop came with me everywhere!

I like the setup wherein the protagonist has to go out at night - when it is more dangerous, which is a bit of a steep learning curve BUT the player is rewarded with safer areas in which to travel day and night.
So, this game has something succeeds where SO MANY others fail - the lack of scaling as the player advances.

I played for hours non-stop because I truly conquered areas, and when I returned I was able to smash my way through the zombies in a more efficient and fun fashion because I had leveled up.
If I CHOSE to - I could enter a more advanced area...and those areas often have to be reached by going through the now relatively easier areas.

Also, this game has something games simply do NOT possess anymore - a chance for the player to relax and enjoy their conquests with no penalties!
For instance - once I obtained enough resources, made sure the local threat area was reduced, and required time-sensitive quests are completed - I could just wait nights out building up my base - again, with little to no penalty!
In fact, I could build up my forces over the course of a few nights and then emerge when I felt ready, rested and bored to conquer more.

Despite being a recommended review, this will not be positive. To explain why, it is simply that I am looking at it from the perspective of someone that 100% completed the game. The recommendation is for people that DO NOT want to do that. This game is very fun if you don't want completion. If you DO want completion, this game goes from good to absolutely AWFUL and you should stay far away. I have to focus on just the issues, so I'm sorry if things don't make sense.

The faction system is never explained, and punishes the player constantly for not know about it. To side with the police, you need to do one guaranteed random event in the right way to make future events more likely, and you need to have the best reputation possible. If you do, there are a couple of events that can block the mafia from interacting with you. Sound good? Well, one of those two events leads to another that removes protection, and the other one will be more or less forcefully removed if you dip in reputation. This means that you cannot deal in fakes, meaning forgers are completely off the table, unless you want to wait and have the police officer come and claim your fake for almost none of its actual value. This means that you have effectively locked yourself out of an entire system if you don't want the game to punish you. 
The Mafia is even worse. There's a barrier of entry to this one that I saved to talk about until now. You need to be at Criminal reputation. Do this early game and you are completely screwed, because criminal reputation prompts events like Agents showing up to your shop, accusing you of having fakes, and then they either take EVERY. SINGLE. SOLITARY. ITEM. You have, or they give a massive fine that's game ending until you get a foot-hold. This means that you can't even start this story until mid game at LEAST. Top that off with the fact that the mafia upsides SUCK

Let's talk about Mafia Guy, and his money begging. You can say no to him. But if you do, you upset Don Vito. He shows up, and demands money. You can tell him no if you have the right stats, which isn't hard because this'll be late-early to early-mid game, but then he'll steal one item from you at random. Later, Mafia Guy returns. Deny. Don Vito returns. He steals 2 items this time. Mafia guy returns. Deny. This time, an agent will come in asking you to testify against Don Vito. Obviously, you agree, he's really annoying. Great. He's in prison. Now you have set your run up for the worst random even there is. It might not happen if you're going for the shortest ending, or even the money ending, but if you're going for the time ending, as far as I can tell, it WILL happen. Eventually, Don Vito shows up again. Now there are two ways this can go. If you paid the repairman, then you can finally have the policeman make good on his word to come running if you yell for him, and Don Vito just steals your best item. But if you didn't do that, if you aren't in the Policeman's good graces, Don takes over $100,000 AND EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE YOU HAVE. This event is supposed to be super rare, on the playthrough where I was trying to get it, it took till week 130 day 4. But on the playthrough where I went for the Lawyer achievement? Week 41. I lost nearly everything with NO recourse just because I played the game in a way that is evidently considered wrong. If that had been my first playthrough, I probably would have lost through NO FAULT OF MY OWN. Sending Don to jail is an insanely easy thing to do, I'd bet most players do that if they aren't lucky enough to get one of the anti-mafia events before then. That is a crime against game design, it feels almost spiteful to the player. 

The developers of this game do not respect your time even a little bit. It's time I talk about my issues with the endings. Let's get one thing out of the way. I have no issue with the maximum fame ending. You can achieve it by week 80 even on a really bad run. My first ever win on this game was the ending known as ""End of the World"". This affront to game design asks that you make it to week 157 day 4. Doesn't sound too bad? It took over twenty GOD DAMN HOURS. And that wouldn't be so bad... If I were playing the damn game! But I was actively discouraged from doing that because earning too much money would give me a different ending! For 70 god damned weeks I had NOTHING TO DO. I had enough money that even with the most expensive shop and staff, I would never get CLOSE to going bankrupt. I'm not kidding. It was hours on hours clicking buttons hundreds of times just to get a few weeks further, with 0 hardship. It was the most soul draining, BORING EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD! I hated it, so much, but I couldn't stop, each day in game I got a bit closer, just a bit. If I estimate each day took only one minute, which it didn't, that would still be well over 8 ENTIRE HOURS OF NOTHING. I genuinely think this ending existing makes this a bad game. Straight up. And there's another that keeps on theme with the devs not respecting your time. ""I'm going to be President"". Make 500,000,000 dollars. And I don't mean in total gross income, that would be to easy, right? That's obviously a joke, you don't even need to make one FIFTH of that to WIN THE GAME. But no, you have to have it on hand. So in effect, it's more like ""Make 1,000,000,000"". I'm not exaggerating. I was very close to a BILLION IN TOTAL GROSS INCOME BY TIME I GOT THIS ENDING. This ending makes me almost as mad as the other one, because remember how I said that like, very few good items enter your door, and many MANY worthless ones do? Now factor in that you don't even get all of the items you want, let alone make a good profit, and you have an awful grind that is 100% tedium, and you have another affront to game design! I used to love this game, but now... I can't forgive these endings.

Closing thoughts:
Wow... I had a LOT to say here, I've been writing well over an hour and a half. but to put into perspective why... I would have given this game an 8/10 genuinely before I came back to complete it.... Now, if you don't count completionist... to me it's down to a 4/10, and that doesn't feel good. This game meant a lot to me, but now... with this behind me.... it's like a 1/10. And I hate that... But I don't want others to go through this. This game can look and feel good... It can make good memories... but I look at games as a whole, I try to complete every game I play, and usually, even if I got really mad, I feel proud at the end... I can even gain new appreciation for them, but here? I'm just relieved I never have to do that again. If anything is confusing, it's cause I had to gut the review to post it.

而本作很喜欢做一些所谓“反逻辑”，即光看角色描述是个大好人，判他活着却能来个大转折，造成很大的世界状态减值；或描述上十恶不赦，但让他活着反而好处更多。这种反逻辑的滥用让玩家在一周目没有获得特殊工具的情况下，几乎不可能能向自己想要的方向推进。在游戏中经常碰到这种情况，任务需要处死某人，有些玩家看描述上是个纯好人应该判他活，最后却发现有很大的负面效果。这种情况一旦发生，给玩家带来的负反馈就极大。

玩家需要进行到二周目时才可以提前预知一些结果对世界状态的变动值，而开发者本意也似乎是希望玩家在一周目打出坏结局以后再进行二周目，但对于二周目过分的强调只能让人觉得一周目在浪费时间，毫无意义。

除此之外，本作还有诸如存在剧情肤浅，UI层级混乱，存在恶性bug等问题。虽然本作有一些独特的设计，比如各种道具的奇妙用法，以及隐藏的世界状态值等，但依旧掩盖不了上述致命的缺陷，终究只能是对Papers Please拙劣的模仿。

[h1][b] 6.5 / 10 [/b][/h1] | Based on the ratings it already has, this game clearly has an audience that loves it. Personally I got it because I liked ""Papers, Please"" and this was recommended as being similar. I don't find it very similar at all.

I found the design and presentation to be perfectly fine and attractive and all that.

Rather than tear apart a perfectly serviceable project with opinions that almost nobody will read, I'll simply say that the gameplay loop didn't work for me. I gave it a full 28 day in-game cycle, just to be sure, but ultimately it left me uninspired to give it another cycle. Given that the developers clearly intend for the player to take several passes at it, and I'm left feeling more like I'll never get those two and a half hours back, I can't recommend it.

Maybe if you can get this title on sale for $2 or so (it goes on sale periodically), pick it up and see if it appeals to you. | Очень интересная игра, поражающая своей вариативностью.

Также есть бар, где каждый выходные можно послушать истории различный ""душ"" и выпить коктейли, влияющие на мировые характеристики.

This game was a decent RPG auto battler with simple mechanics where of course, you build your own team composition. I like how the game emphasizes the relevancy of classes and their late game capabilities. We could build whatever purpose we want with them as long as you know what to do. A tank could be DPS character, a mage could be a tank, so on and so forth. 

The game is also not one of those easy done, go next. Paying attention to the enemies' powers and passives will be also crucial to winning the game. The ascension / corruption feature may be difficult but challenging enough to make me finish the game to 100% achievement.

It is an underrated RPG game. I hope there would be sequel like how the risk of rain done to expand and make it more immersive.

The problem, like a lot of other reviews will point out, is that it seems as though they force walls on you which either require days and days of grinding to get through, or of course, premium currency.

I think to make meaningful progress without dumping hundreds of dollars into the game you'd need to play for years and years grinding the same parts over and over. It's really sad because it's clearly a good game, but the way the game is balanced to force you to feel like you need to spend money ruins it. Honestly I don't normally mind spending a little bit of money on these types of games to support the devs for making good games and whatnot, however the value of the products they offer just isn't on par with the price either.

I'd like to keep playing this, but I don't think I can deal with it in its current state anymore. Another side effect of these design choices is that the game hasn't really been an 'idle' game for me. I've had to really be present in it, continually switching monsters and levels and upgrading cards to keep progressing. If you step away from it your progress is essentially halted within a minute because of the way things scale.

TL;DR: Good game butchered by stalling tactics.

Set in a dystopian world where you play as a landlord tasked with spying on tenants for a totalitarian government, the game artfully combines strategy, storytelling, and morality in a way that few games manage to achieve.

From the moment you step into the grim, oppressive atmosphere of the apartment building, the game immerses you in its richly detailed world. The art style is stunningly minimalist, with a dark aesthetic that perfectly complements the oppressive tone of the story. The haunting music and sound design further pull you into the game's bleak reality.

Gameplay Highlights:

Engaging Decisions: Every choice you make matters. Do you report a tenant for illegal activity to protect your family, or do you turn a blind eye and risk your position? The moral dilemmas are intense and often heart-wrenching.
Strategic Gameplay: Managing resources, time, and relationships adds a layer of complexity that keeps you on your toes. Balancing the demands of the government, your tenants, and your own family is no small feat.
Dynamic Storytelling: The branching narrative and multiple endings provide excellent replay value. Each playthrough feels unique, encouraging you to explore different paths and outcomes.
Why It Stands Out: What sets Beholder apart is its ability to make you reflect on your own morality. It's not just about winning or completing tasks—it's about what kind of person you choose to be in an unforgiving world. Few games strike such a perfect balance between strategy and storytelling, making every moment impactful.

Verdict: Beholder is a must-play for fans of strategy, narrative-driven games, or dystopian settings. It’s a unique experience that lingers in your mind long after you’ve put down the controller. I can’t recommend it enough—if you’re ready for a game that challenges both your mind and your conscience, Beholder is the perfect choice.

Ein Hoch auf die Entwickler !
Gute Idee ! Sehr abwechslungsreich. | [h3]Pretty chill deck building based on resource and space management, but it does require a certain amount of grind and can get repetitive.[/h3]

This is your game if you want a deck building that doesn't involve (constant) combats, or if you find some city builders too complex: here each card is usually a building and you just need to pay its cost and place it next to the resorces it harvests. Yeah, once in a while one or two enemies will show up and you need a couple of warrior or divine power cards to defend yourself, but for the most part it's a pretty chill game.

The bad news is that there are only 4 different civilizations you can play with, and each has a pretty clear ""best strategy"", so once you play once or twice with each one it can get repetitive pretty quickly (all games will feel the same). The worst part is that you need to play a good number of very similar games to complete the campaign or unlock the best cards, so it can become a chore.

I would recommend this game if you find it on sale for $ 10 / € 10 or less, the first 10-15 hours of gameplay are pretty fun."

https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43360703/ | Why did I spend so much time in this game? The gameplay loop is highly addictive. It has the 'just one more run' feel of good roguelikes. The achievements provide unique challenges. The mix of different characters and equipment makes runs feel different. Instead of a deck of cards, you upgrade a set of dice. The RNG can be grindy at times, but the UI is smooth and as I said the gameplay loop is enjoyable."

um dos únicos pontos negativos é que não é traduzido pra português mas é um inglês bem simples, então se souber um pouco não vai passar dificuldade.

 | I had fun with it when I first got the game. The gameplay loop in design is overall pretty solid. Unfortunately the devs really don't understand the RNG and probability issues that arise in this game model if not kept in check. They keep adding a ton of underwhelming items that bloats the item pool making it harder and harder to produce a build that's usable. If it on sale maybe give it a shot, or wait for them to come out of EA and see if they learn their lesson. At the moment though I'm not sure I'd really give the game a nod for anyone asking for recommendations. | 更新的东西越来越多 就像把一堆珍馐美味放进一口大锅 看上去高端大气 实则味如嚼蜡 食如泔水 华而不实 | 上手简单，构建背包玩法很独特，成型后就是爽局了。就是感觉一局下来太短了，刚成型就差不多结束了，挺希望能搞个一局久点的模式"

年近四十，上有老下有小的人是很难抽出整块时间坐在电脑前静静品味一个游戏，趁着这个春节，下定决心品尝这杯已经做好了多年的咖啡，于是力排众议顶住压力（感谢妻子的理解支持），在电脑前坐了一周indulging play，99小时40分通关了游戏，在深夜的屏幕前久久回味难以忘怀，震撼到无以复加，这注定是我人生难忘的精神之旅，也是我游戏编年史上最璀璨的坐标。

Larian在此呈现的，远非寻常意义上的电子游戏。
作为游戏，各种设计完美衔接，恰到好处；自由度高到令人发指，你可以做你自己；装备/等级/数据都是精心设计，兼顾了最大公约数；
作为音乐，Down by the river随河风飘扬成流动的叙事，I Want to Live在抉择时刻撕开灵魂，The Power见证胜利后紧握棱镜的双手，各类主题曲契合场景主题，已然挣脱媒介的桎梏，变成可以交互的交响诗，让我事后还反复专门聆听感慨；
作为剧本，这内容本身就是很精彩的小说，作者们绝对有撰写一部畅销魔幻小说的深厚功力。正义/邪恶，生存/死亡，杀戮/放生等人性和生命的主题引人哲思；如果去电影院是用2.5h欣赏了一部有深度的电影，那么在BG3，你是用100h+去体验有无奈有选择有善恶的跌宕魔幻人生。
我把游戏结束后在营地跟大家聊天的最后存档命名“Do not want to say Farewell”，一路走来，跟这堆朋友和战友同甘共苦，真的希望能一起继续生活下去，最后营地跟大家聊天穷尽选项，试图寻找更多的互动，特别是跟影心的七八次拥抱还留有数据的余温，舍不得说再见。但是Larian残忍又仁慈地让每个同行者带着伤痕继续前行——有人背负星辰远征，有人归于市井炊烟。这何尝不是最温柔的现实主义：所有相遇终究要归还给时光。
至此，我的龙与地下城故事已封存在剑湾的晚风中，有生之年，我还会再体验阿斯代伦和其它角色的一生。或许这正是CRPG的伟大之处：它允许我们在现实生活的夹缝里，体验无数个未曾活过的自己。

虽然也能看到一些对BG3批评改进的意见，但是瑕不掩瑜，个人认为有些地方确实可以再改进以方便玩家，有些意见却是因人而异而不能算作缺点和批评。
当你花了10-15h去学习这个游戏的机制和基本原理后跨过门槛，你真的无法想象Larian是如何创作出这样一部伟大作品的。如果这部作品无法被超越，是因为她确实太精湛也值得珍惜。如果被超越，那么游戏史上又多了另一颗明珠，也是我们的另一份礼物。
谢谢你，Larian。

A Love Letter to the Ninth Art – A Middle-Aged Player's 100-Hour Journey Through Baldur's Gate 3

As someone nearing forty, with both elderly parents and young children to care for, finding large chunks of time to sit in front of a computer and savor a game is no easy feat. This Spring Festival, I made up my mind to finally taste this cup of coffee that had been brewing for years. With the understanding and support of my wife (for which I am deeply grateful), I managed to carve out a week to indulge in uninterrupted play. After 99 hours and 40 minutes, I completed the game. Sitting in front of the screen late at night, I was left in awe, unable to shake the profound impact it had on me. This journey will undoubtedly remain one of the most unforgettable experiences of my life, a radiant milestone in my personal gaming history.

What Larian has created here is far from an ordinary video game.

As a game, every design element is seamlessly integrated, perfectly balanced. The freedom it offers is almost overwhelming—you can truly be yourself. The equipment, levels, and stats are meticulously crafted, catering to a broad spectrum of players.

As music, Down by the River drifts with the breeze, becoming a flowing narrative. I Want to Live tears at your soul during moments of decision, and The Power resonates as you grasp the prism in victory. Each theme song fits its scene so perfectly that it transcends the medium, transforming into an interactive symphonic poem that I found myself revisiting and reflecting on long after the game had ended.

As a novel, the content itself is a masterful piece of fantasy literature. The writers clearly possess the skill to craft a best-selling fantasy novel. Themes of justice versus evil, life versus death, and killing versus sparing provoke deep philosophical reflection. If watching a movie in a theater is like spending 2.5 hours appreciating a thought-provoking film, then Baldur's Gate 3 is like spending over 100 hours living a tumultuous, magical life filled with difficult choices and moral dilemmas.

I named my final save file in the camp, where I chatted with everyone before the end, ""Do Not Want to Say Farewell."" After journeying together, sharing both hardships and triumphs with these friends and comrades, I truly wished we could continue living together. I exhausted every dialogue option in the camp, searching for more interactions, especially with Shadowheart, whose seven or eight hugs still lingered with the warmth of data. I couldn’t bear to say goodbye. Yet, Larian, in their cruel yet merciful way, allowed each companion to move forward with their scars—some destined to carry the stars on their shoulders, others to return to the mundane life of hearth and home. This, perhaps, is the most tender form of realism: all encounters must eventually be returned to the passage of time.

Thus, my Dungeons & Dragons tale has been sealed in the evening breeze of the Sword Coast. In this lifetime, I will return to experience the lives of Astarion and other characters. Perhaps this is the greatness of CRPGs: they allow us, in the crevices of our real lives, to live countless versions of ourselves we never had the chance to be.

While there are some criticisms and suggestions for improvement regarding BG3, they are minor blemishes on an otherwise flawless gem. Some aspects could indeed be tweaked for player convenience, while others are subjective preferences rather than flaws.

Once you’ve spent 10-15 hours learning the game’s mechanics and fundamental principles, crossing that threshold, you can’t help but marvel at how Larian managed to create such a masterpiece. If this work remains unrivaled, it’s because it is truly exquisite and deserves to be cherished. If it is ever surpassed, then another jewel will have been added to the annals of gaming history, another gift for us all.

Thank you, Larian. | This is probably going to be one of the best games for the next decade, the voice acting is sublime and the writers seemed to have made deals with the devil in order to make such a good tale. 10/10 | The replayability of this game is insane, Larian did an amazing job giving us exactly what we wanted and maybe even a little more. This game has taken over my life and I love it so much, lol, and showing no signs of putting it down any time soon! | I have played this game for 6 hours (2h on character creator), never played this type of game before.. can say I am impressed and enjoying it a lot.

18 hours in the game: I think that I'm addicted. The stories are surprising and wholesome. I feel like a hero in this game, living for the good of the people.

50 hours: I finally finished act 1. And oh boy did I turn from good to evil with every step I took. I didn't mean to be... How was I supposed to know that pulling the wrong lever, I'll be catapulting a gnome to space. That wasn't my fault.

80 hours: Yes! Give me your gold. All the shiny trinkets you have. Give me your soul and all the power you hold. Give me more... MORE!

100 hours: How dare you look down on me, thinking like you could ever defeat me?! Hit me with all you got, it will never be enough!

120 hours: ... *only screams echo in the darkness* ...

130 hours: *Muahahaha-*
You may call me the blood queen,
but your agenda is also driven by greed.
The battle you lost, your advisors lied.
Your heroes are dead, your city is mine.
No evil as dark or vengeance as red,
have never been seen as I took the kings head. | I started playing this game a year and a few months after it was launched and immediately got into character creation which took me over an hour not to mention building my Dream Guardian. Since purchasing it at full price, I was weary to buy a game for 60 bucks, but it has been the best 60 bucks I've spent in a LONG time. 

The whole game itself doesn't hold your hand during the game, but it does help you build up your skills and learn how to play as you go which is great for those who haven't played CRPG turn based game before. I have basically played this nonstop since October to pass time and as you can see with my 527 hours on record, I absolutely LOVE this game. The options for responses and endings are endless. I'm thoroughly blown away with the voice acting and, yes, the mod options. There are many people who hate playing with mods, but to me it adds a lot to the game and enhances my game play experience making me want to play it more. I have done numerous campaigns and as of January 2025, I'm doing my 2nd durge campaign trying to play a somewhat evil character which is hard as I've cried from being evil to pixels haha. 

Overall, I think this game may be the best game I've ever played and I love how Larian and the VA's show their active participation in the community along with Larian giving us FREE updates and gives modders the toolkit. This company could've charged $100 or more for this game with the amount of work and thought put into it along with the (again) FREE updates, but they didn't. They have shown they care more for the player's experience and making a game that out beats other new games and certain *ahem developers AHEM Bethesda* by giving us a game that is completed at release (from what I've been told by other gamers who played this at release). I recommend this game to anyone who wants a rich, fulfilling game that doesn't have any extra catches outside the initial price."

We have hired 9 people so far and they keep bugging out / getting stuck while holding our products. The only way to fix it is to exit out and come back in, which causes us to lose the product(s). Also, we label our shelves, but the employees disregard it and put whatever they want on it even though they are maxed out on their skills. They do that both inside the store and storage room. Lastly, having to go through every single product to check/ change prices 2x a week is ridiculous. There should be a better system for that. There is a machine but that is crazy high priced on top of the products already being over-priced and other bills.

Очень понравилась, абсолютно не напряжная, со своим стилем и историей игра. Однозначно рекомендую! | Decent enough puzzle box game, especially for the price I got it at ($1.19). I think the item duplication and endoscope mechanics helped make it a bit more unique. Not fantastic, but might scratch an itch if you're a fan of the genre. | There is a lot to be said about Machinika: Museum, mostly good and a little bad.  Let me start by saying the I loved the game overall.  I purchased this at a heavy discount, but would have purchased it at the full $7.99 USD price, it would be worth that price tag.  My short review will be broken down into 3 parts.

The Short Review: 4/5 Stars overall good game the puzzles are a bit easy for advanced puzzlers who have played games like the Myst Series, and others in the genre.  Visuals are good, could use more scene variation.  Music fits, but could use some varition.  Price is fitting for game length. 

The Good:  The graphics are very good, lend a sense of realism to the world they are crafted in. They are smooth throughout and I didn't detect or have in glitching or clipping of any kind. The music is fitting to the game and story. The sounds are solid and fit the environment well.  The game play and controls are nice land end themselves to the realism of the environment.  I also liked how when you finished a chapter the puzzle crate slowly built up in the room. The ability to move an object in a full circle was a nice touch.  (I have seen and played other games where you just ""travel"" to the other side of an item instead of manipulating the object to turn it.) 

The Bad: (More like small nit-picks) I dislike Chapter breakdowns. Yeah I get it you are finished with one puzzle and it is time to move to the next puzzle.  I would have liked to have seen another location in the museum. or had a cut scene to show the delivery of another artifact.  The same goes for the music, do not get me wrong the music fits the game, I just wish there was more of it and also for it to change with the game and with certain scenes to add to the tension.  

The Ugly: (Not as bad as you would think)  I needed more game, yes for the price you get about 5-ish hours of game play.  Not bad given the complexity of the puzzles and game play had I not blundered through a few puzzles and remembered the tools I had at my disposable I probably would have completed the game in a trim 4 hrs.  Needed change of scenery and music between puzzles.

In closing the Developers and persons who created this game did an excellent job. I look forward to seeing what Machinika: Atlas has to offer though it appears that the game may be delayed for release, because in the game it seems to be expected by Late 2024. I just bought and finished this game in January of 2025.
