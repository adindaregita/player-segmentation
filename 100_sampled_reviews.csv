I've been drooling over all the Rockstar games on Steam, and every time I look at the comment section, see people complaining about the Social Club feature. This has completely put me off all of their titles, as someone with limited internet access, and a disdain for filling in forms, I mainly play offline. I bought this a while ago on sale and got this game downloaded on my crawling internet, so this was a good test I thought, to see if their games can function offline. I started up L.A. Noire, and it asked me to create a Social Club account, and on the right hand side of that menu, in smaller print, to create a local profile. I went with that option, to create a local profile and it asked me to type a name, and that was it. I could play offline, no need for Social Club. And could play it completely offline any other day. Test passed, on to the game itself. This game features heavily on the character interactions and communication, the likes I have not experienced before. I've never been one to care for things like lip synch techniques, and in-case someone wants to see a good case study of how it should be done, this is it. Not only lip synchronization, but facial features with animations as well for that matter are very life-like, even though the models are slightly dated. The character narratives are not only shown in a cut-scene style, but also while you are investigating, giving your actions and the npcs reactions a lifelike give and take. And speaking of the facial animations, in other games it's done purely for technical achievement, or art for style points. Here it's literally a feature, you have to read the persons' body language that you are interrogating by looking at their behaviour, and their facial expressions. They really are life-like and you can see their personality in those sometimes very subtle facial animations alone. It's remarkable. The world is flat. Some claim that the world is round. This one definitely is not. We're probably used to a lot better open world city type scenery by now, but this has a lot of small attention to details, and the world is densely created with professional art while it does have a overall, what I would call a clinical cleanliness feel to it. Or best described as the look of a simulator of sorts, instead of trying to beautify everything. It's running good in 4k on my humble PC, and it's all a very pleasant experience. Plenty of old fashioned cars beautifully created, and plays responsive enough to enjoy driving places. While the world itself is a bit lacking in colour, they are not afraid to use colourful language and red pixels when the bullets starts flying. For being on the right side of the law they give you plenty of slack to not restrict your fun in playing and throw enough bad guys with a death wish at you to balance the detective work with action. It's a neat game.",0.8 hrs on record,,
76561197971757081,2.0,,Recommended,"I can still clearly see the faces of every person I killed. This game runs incredibly slow at times. It's a feature. ----What is it?---- You shoot a lot of people. And then when you think you've shot them all, some more show up. And then some more, and then even more. Until you think there couldn't possibly be any more to shoot, but then there is. You have a ability to slow down time. You have a ability to shoot. You have a ability to hear yourself think, lamenting your past and ponder on situations while still sounding like a bad-ass. It runs really well on my humble system in 4K. The bullets has a weight to them that you don't see in other shooters. It's a really fun 3rd person shooter game.",1.7 hrs on record,,

76561197971757081,1.0,,Recommended,"I feel the need, the need to drive around town. --what is it?-- It's a driving game, in a arcade style. You get to choose from 3 different objectives to complete during a race, that suits your style. When you complete the objectives, you unlock the next race and then keep on doing that again, pick a objective, have a race, and get some points to buy cars. You can choose to be the cops or not cops. You get some additional helpful items that can benefit you in a race, such as boosters or spike strips. I was put off by the brownish colour tint the game seems to have for a while. As time went on, it was less noticable and it looked better and better the more cars I unlocked. But there is a serious lack of colour that originally was a eyesore. The car models are stunning. The cars handle a lot with the feeling that it's on rails, and if you are used to a more modern Need for speed title, it will feel like you are stuck on the road like glue. Mainly it has to do with the fact that the roads tend to only go one way. You get a weird feeling that you are stuck on a highway. There's never any areas to stop, with crossroads, alleys or traffic lights, or a place to turn into any other street that's connected to it. The whole map is all essentially one big loop. In addition to that the camera I think, that's not as flexible as the newer racing games The car handling does have it's own feel to it, that is very arcade like and the cars feel very heavy. It does take some getting used to, and once I completed it, was really enjoying it thoroughly, mainly because the handling improved drastically with the cars that you get to drive later on. There are a few other major negative points, in that you can't pause the game. Also the keyboard default controls were strange, and worst of all the refresh rate was stuck on 30fps, which felt borderline unplayable. Once that was fixed with a command line that didn't work for me in Steam command line, but once I added it in Origins command line it worked from there. Everything felt so much better, and I could finally enjoy the game.",1.8 hrs on record,,
76561197999259031,4.0,,Recommended,"This might be the most demanding title in my library. Underneath its casual-friendly theme and its welcoming artstyle lies a game of frantic keyboard slapping. If you thought you were good at multi-tasking, think again. If you thought you were good at memorizing keystroke sequences, let's see how good you are. This is as close as a human being will come to being a food-slinging robot as will be possible until the coming Robopocalypse. It's well crafted. It's fun. It's exactly what you already want, stop reading this and get the game already you're wasting time that you could be using to MAKE PIZZAS FOR VIRTUAL PEOPLE AHHH GODDD",7.4 hrs on record																					(7.2 hrs at review time),,
76561197999259031,4.0,,Recommended,"If you enjoy twin-stick shooters with psuedo-random rooms, random unlocks, and permadeath written in Flash... well, you can still do better on any free game site. The Binding of Isaac is a terrible, grindy game that is only worthwhile if you value ""addictiveness"" over substance. There's just not much actual gameplay to this game. It's shallow and dreadfully dull. The randomly generated rooms all look and play the same, and the enemies, while decent and actually fairly well designed, fall flat because of it. The unlocks, while adding a bit of depth to the game, don't add nearly enough to save this poorly executed attempt. Just don't buy it, it's not worth it.",1.0 hrs on record,,
76561197999259031,1.0,,Recommended,"Cute city-builder, but frustrating and shallow. Frustrating: No grid snapping feature- walls and paths are a pain to line up. Buildings, too. There are overlays for ore and soil fertility, but nothing else. Want to see if your parks and such are reaching your structures? Too bad, won't happen. Random events pop up but they have minimal impact on the game. Seasons change but the only difference is that your pops need more fuel for their houses in the winter. You can't click on a given pop (perhaps you're curious where your miners live) and you can't check who's working where. There's list of your people but you can't do anything with it. Shallow: People don't seem to care where they work- miners are as happy as fisherfolks, who are as happy as farmers, etc. Population simulation- your pops want luxuries appropriate to their class, but they don't care which luxury and there's no effect to any of them. They're either happy because they have Furniture or unhappy because they don't have anything. Your king (or whatever) asks you for resources but there's no downside or time limit. Fill them at your leisure. You also seem to get nothing from it. You can't track inputs and outputs, or see what's going where except to watch people coming and going from place to place. No meaningful traffic / congestion mechanics and if there is, I can't see one. It doesn't matter if everybody in your town uses one road to go in and out. There also aren't any carts, wheelbarrows, or other contraptions. Everybody just walks. Social dynamics underdeveloped- some of the random events make a given social class more or less happy or safe and that's about it. Workforce management boils down to 'leave some people as workers and assign the rest to a class of workplace.' You can adjust the numbers of workers at an individual workplace but that's tedious. There's also no way to prioritize certain kinds of work so if your situation changes you're back to changing the number manually and then watching your stockpile grow or shrink. Maybe the game changes substantially after 150 pops (the highest I got, in my second attempt) but I'm not really interested in finding out. I built supply lines for my candle-making shop and had an excess of every possible supply and spent the tail end of my time with the game waiting for more pops. I hate waiting for more pops. Even at 10x speed, it feels like everything takes forever to happen. Maybe in a year or two I'll come back and change my recommendation. If you enjoy the game, good for you. I just kept wondering when I'd get to the good part. I feel like six hours of focused play is enough to decide if a game is worth more of my time. This one, at this stage, isn't.",5.7 hrs on record,,

Towards the end of the dungeon....I get a pop up telling me I am at a junction. To the left is treasure, to the right is Old Nell. So naturally I go right.....MY RIGHT.

The voice acting from the narrator is great, the atmosphere and visual style of the game is nice as well. The story is a bit meh, but its not horrible.

76561198011803825,1.0,,Recommended,"This game is one of the worst ports ever to grace modern PC gaming. A cap of 30 frames per second, 720p limit, Games for Windows Live integration and impossible-to-use mouse + keyboard controls makes playing Dark Souls on the PC a chore. That is, before you install a mod called DSFix. Suddenly, most of these problems disappear, and now you can enjoy one of the best, yet incredibly overrated action RPGs to date. Often people cite Dark Soul's difficulty as one of the strongest points, but it's not so much difficult as it is punishing. Idiot moves will often result in a quick death, and further idiot moves will result in a loss of the souls you have collected, a significant setback for your character's progression. As opposed to the instance-based Demon Souls, Dark Souls is an open-world title where you fight through insanely atmospheric environments to grow stronger and defeat incredibly tough boss monsters. It began as a niche title due to it's old-school RPG gameplay mechanics but soon found a large cult following from it's PC release despite all of it's obvious pre-DSfix problems. It's often quoted as the GOTAY but frankly there are plenty of glaring flaws with it as well. The first half of the game where you learn how to not die every five minutes is exciting, and full of incredible environments which rise your exploration-boner to heights which you've never seen, but once you've understood the combat mechanics well enough and reach the second half of the game things seem to slow down quite a bit. You're faced with uninspired areas, a few boring bosses, and an anti-climactic ending. As soon as you understand how to parry hits and dodge properly the game almost becomes trivial. Though you must understand that I only feel the need to criticise this title due to the overwhelming respect I have for it. Combat is responsive feels weighty, as huge swords and maces should. The integrated multiplayer into the single player experience is incredible, allowing plays to leave behind hints and messages for people in other games to come across, as well as be summoned into other player's worlds to help them progress. In total your first playthrough should accumulate about 50+ hours of unique game content, which is more than enough for what you pay for. Unfortunately, as I said at the beginning, you need to jump through a few hurdles to get to the fun, of which includes buying a controller before you play. A large investment for one game, but I highly doubt you'll be disappointed with what Dark Souls has to offer.",98.8 hrs on record																					(91.5 hrs at review time),,

76561198011803825,1.0,,Recommended,"If you're new to Isaac, consider holding off on this DLC until you have dived further into the game, namely once you've defeated the Cathedral and Seoul bosses a few times. By that point you'll probably know by then if you want to progress any further. A big point to note about Repentance is that the target audience is people who have already played up to the Afterbirth+ expansion and want more challenges. For this reason, this DLC will be VERY hard for newcomers and casual players. Whilst there are a bunch of quality of life changes and some really neat new items, a lot of the content (namely the new floors and new characters) are locked behind some challenging barriers, with a lot of the really cool items you might have seen on youtube or something being locked behind some of the most challenging content the game has to offer.

While it retains most of the same mechanics, these dungeons feel like they have such limited item and monster pools so the levels are really tedious.  Also painful to me, at least in these story dungeons, death is so meaningless.  Something kills you?  No problem warp right back to that dungeon with all your gear and exp and try again.  Face something too tough?  Also, no problem, just redo an earlier dungeon to grind up enough so that later dungeon is no longer a threat.  The post story stuff can make or break this game, but as a guy not at all interested in the story and just wants a fun Mystery Dungeon game, you're far better off with Touhou Genso Wanderer: Reloaded.

76561198037222425,16.0,,Recommended,"I long assumed this was a sequel to TGW:R, but in fact, it is more of a prequel. As explained to me on Discord when comparing this to TGW:R... ""TGW Reloaded is the definitive edition of the remaster of Mystery Gensokyo 3(Fushigi no Gensokyo 3): Tower of Desire. Without any DLC, it contains the base game, the Mononobe no Futo and the Seven Trials DLC, The Bullet Reporter, The King of Fairies, and Miracle Ambitions (aka Versus Miracle Party), which were all absent from the original release of Mystery Gensokyo 3: Tower of Desire on launch, January 31, 2014. These were all included in the remaster: ""Mystery Gensokyo: Tower of Desire -RELOADED-"", released in NA on March 21, 2017. The only story DLC missing from that version was Clock Remains, which was released July 20, 2018, and also not included in the Steam and Switch version released as ""Touhou Genso Wanderer -RELOADED-"" on October 25, 2018, and was released instead as additional DLC. Lotus Labyrinth R is the remaster of Mystery Gensokyo 2(Fushigi no Gensokyo 2): Miracle Party, originally released December 30, 2011. Aside from additional characters, the game has no story-adding DLC."" So what this means is in many ways it is a bit of a step back, losing a lot of TGW:R's crafting mechanics, weapon evolving, and item resonance mechanics. We do at least get to play as HUGE parties (imagine as opposed to having 1 AI partner shooting off skills at random, 19 AI allies doing as much) and you get access to some characters not included in TGW:R.",33.5 hrs on record																					(4.4 hrs at review time),,

While not an attempt to emulate real life tables (Pinball Arcade or Zaccaria), nor attempting to wow you with a surreal pinball table based off a random film IP, Made of Bits have managed to create something really addictive here. I think the biggest hook of this series is its mod unlocks.  Each table in this game have all sorts of clever modifiers you can add to the game to either add new modes or give you extra bonuses for certain actions.  To unlock these mods you need to earn tickets which is done by either rolling the ball over these said tickets when they appear in a game or complete daily quests (that can be goals tied to a specific table you've unlocked or something generic you can do on any of the tables).",28.2 hrs on record																					(6.2 hrs at review time),,

Some things could probably be made a little more streamlined and/or tweaked entirely but overall its a great game! Dying isn't exactly a bad thing and the ways you'll die will either make you laugh or just freak you out. My favorite enemy is the worm thing, it's just fun to have one slink outta a hole and start chomping on your brain or try to. Not to mention your character will rag doll violently and realistically sometimes and that adds a lot to the game by itself. Alongside the rag doll and barotrauma, the player and the environment have that vibe and style that I can get behind since it makes it extremely easy on the eyes with nothing really 3D. I really think this game is worth some amount of your time because it's kinda addicting to explore and be work through puzzles that don't feel like puzzles but odd outer space mining work. My one real issue is I've soft-locked myself at least twice with the vehicles getting stuck and or upside down, just make an option for vehicles to reset like you can kill yourself and I think that fix the only issue I've had.

76561198127605984,1.0,,Recommended,"Read this review if you want to find out why 7th Deep isn't 'just another rpgmaker game'. 7th Deep has a simple premise. Get to the bottom of the dungeon in order to recieve a relic that's supposed to be insane powers. It's nothing new, but it works for this type of game. You get to choose between seven characters to begin with. 2 are evil, 3 are neutral, and 2 are good. Once you choose a character, you get a 2nd character (who isn't a part of the beginning crew) shortly after and then finally as you go along you'll recruit a 3rd member from the other beginning characters you didn't choose at the start. Each character is competely different from each other. Who you choose MATTERS. One character can kill NPCs for extra loot. One can drink the blood of NPCs to heal. One can craft healing items from herbs. One will cause you to find extra tresure chests. And there's more, but I'll let you find it out yourself. Over the 50 floors, you'll find a great diversity in what is going on. There are puzzles, traps, teleporters, and more to deal with. Weak enemies will randomly run around, allowing you get the jump on them for an extra free turn. More challanging enemies will chase you down, and can get an extra turn on you if you don't face them in time. The difficulty isn't too hard, at least on the normal difficulty. I haven't tried ""survival mode"" yet. However, if you do find yourself being overpowered, the game does have the ability to teleport back to previous floors for grinding. You even get to re-open previous chests to get more loot. In this respect, you can choose whether to go straight forward for difficulty, or grind to make things simplier. There are 2 endings for each character, and 7 characters to begin your adventure with. Replay value is through the roof. And with each run taking around 9 or 10 hours, you will absolutely get your moneys worth at just $2.99.",8.5 hrs on record																					(6.9 hrs at review time),,
76561198127605984,1.0,,Recommended,"This game is a stat nerd's dream. Keep in mind I hate playing MOBA games, I tried my best to like DOTA2 and quit after 5 hours of gameplay. So the fact I enjoy this game says something. I love strategy games, and there is a lot to do here. My hours on this game are only going to keep rising. Already have 12 hours in 3 days of playing (yes I have a job).",34.3 hrs on record																					(12.8 hrs at review time),,
76561198127605984,1.0,,Recommended,"If you can't tell by the 200+ (at current time) hours I have on this game, I really like it. Be warned, this game will take away your free time. This game is free, and while it has options to pay for extra stuff, this is NOT a pay to win game. Any one with enough time can do well, the purchases only make things run a little quicker. Very basic graphics, sound, music (that you turn off after a while), and a very basic premise. The same could be said for Tetris and it did fairly well. If you have ADD, OCD, or other compulsive disorders, you'll never want to stop playing. I know from experience.",479.4 hrs on record																					(240.0 hrs at review time),,
76561198127605984,2.0,,Recommended,"I've been addicted to this game for the last week. It is a mix of collectable card games like Yu Gi Oh or M:TG. However, unlike most CCGs, you do not have to BUY the booster packs either through in game currency or real money. You earn them through the gameplay which is a major bonus to me. The story is better than you would expect from a game of this genre as well. If you choose to, you can find that every person you come across has several (sometimes more than a dozen) different things they will say to you. And what they say will change depending on whether or not you have defeated them yet. The actual gameplay is quite balanced. As you get stronger, so does the opponents. And there are many different strategies you must use. Going all out offense will work sometimes, but some characters are built to counter with good defense and the ability to disable your best cards at just the right times. You must choose your deck wisely depending on your opponent. This depth is part of what makes this game so fun. The art style may turn some people off but I think it's very endearing and original. I don't know any of the indie games that this takes it's characters from but it's cartoonish and quirky and simple and it fits the overall mood of the game. The best part of the whole game however must be the music. Everything from the menu screen, to the various places you visit, to the battles have music that is perfect for the situation. It's soothing and it's energizing at the same time. This, along with the humor of the game, and the visual styling make this a game you will never want to put down. Although I have not beaten it yet, I know from reading around that the game has more things to accomplish even after you defeat the 'final boss'. So replay value is strong here too.",25.4 hrs on record																					(20.3 hrs at review time),,
76561198127605984,1.0,,Recommended,"This game was a surprise hit for me. I just happened to catch a Let's Play of it on YT and decided it looked interesting. So I get the game, play it for a while, end my session and look at the time. 8 hours. I played the game 8 hours on my 1st playthough. That's how much fun I was having. Good thing it was my day off. So what is so special about the game? 1. The factions you play as actually play different. And the fact you can mix and match by choosing a sub faction to supplement your deck means there are an almost endless amount of strategic oppurtunities. 2. The flow of the game is perfect. There are 3 levels of play, it's sort of a tower defense in this way. But turn based rather than real time. You have to plan out how to kill or weaken the enemies enough that they can't get through all of your defenses. The spells help a lot with certain factions to even the odds on harder waves. 3. Progression is fun. Unlocking things in roguelikes/roguelites is hit or miss. This game hits it. You are always unlocking more things. And everything you unlock improves your next playthoughs. It's exciting to find out what you will get next. 4. Enemies are varied. Not only that, bosses have multiple forms. One of the stage 3 bosses for example has a time bomb. And depending on the interation of the boss, the bombs can hit twice, they can have a damage shield that makes it harder to get rid of, or other things. 5. There's more to it than the regular game. There's a daily challenge where you go for top of the leaderboards with set penalties and boons that everyone has. The factions, starting decks, and rules are the same for everyone so it's a matter of how good you use it rather than who is the highest level in the game. 6. It can be insanely hard, for those who like that. Like Slay the Spire, you can make the game harder through tiers that add rules as you progress making it almost impossible to win unless you really know the ins and outs of the game. I personally stick with the base difficulty, but I can see how this would add hours to someone's enjoyment of the game. Cons? I guess the fact that each game can take near an hour could turn some people off. Also, it's not an easy game even at base difficulty. But if you're a fan of rogue games, you probably like it hard anyway. Honestly, it's a near perfect experience. It rivals Slay the Spire as the best roguelike/rougelite on Steam.",46.0 hrs on record																					(27.1 hrs at review time),,

Not to mention the story, it describes showdowns with the old west's most famous gunslingers and outlaws. The combat was really fun and satisfying, especially the duels.
