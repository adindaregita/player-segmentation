"76561197970698176,1,N/A,Recommended,A fun way to spend 100 hours. Increasingly buggy as the game goes on and somewhat laggy in Act 3 but for a game of this scope an very impressive achievement indeed. I recommend playing as the Dark Urge, which honestly feels like the character the game was meant to be played as. Scratches that DoS2 itch,if you enjoyed DoS2 or just want some D&D turn based action then this is a must play. A very worth successor to the original Baldurs Gate games., which honestly feels like the character the game was meant to be played as.

"76561197970698176,1,N/A,Recommended,6 hours in and loving it so far. A roguelike RPG with a world to explore, quests to complete, skills to learn and level up through practice and monsters to kill. A little rough in places, looking forward to seeing it improve and grow through early access. 2nd Dec update: Beat all the bosses and finished the content available currently after 20 hours . This was with restarting after each character death (no enforced permadeath in the game) .

76561197970698176,1,N/A,Recommended,Short but fun. Very satisfying stacking cards and enraging when animals wander around and move them! Looking forward to more content. Worth the price of admission,6.9 hrs on record																					(4.6 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197970698176,1,N/A,Recommended,Fun little card-based civ building duelling game. A bit like Through the Ages which is a huge recommendation by itself but condensed into 10 minute matches.,12.5 hrs on record																					(9.3 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197970698176,1,N/A,Recommended,Civilization with the boring bits cut out. It's been a while since I've been this hooked on a game. Not tried the multiplayer yet but single player is a blast. If you liked Civ I think you will enjoy this.,222.3 hrs on record																					(21.1 hrs at review time),N/A
"76561197970698176,1,N/A,Recommended,Addictive turn-based strategy. Lots of different classes that all have their own units and spells which makes the game play differently each time. Interesting world and lore, actually makes me want to read the unit descriptions. Graphics and UI and basic but functional. Not sure about AI yet, seems quite variable from game to game. Worth a look if you fancy a civ / master of magic style game without the city building and a focus on army building and territory control., actually makes me want to read the unit descriptions.

"76561197970698176,1,N/A,Recommended,""Well that was intense.  Just finished my first game, 23 minutes of action has left me drenched in sweat and with a big grin on my face.  Slow to start but by wave 16 I was constantly ducking and weaving while lobbing my shield like a maniac and laughing my ass off.  I refunded holopoint as the constant spinning made me feel sick but the enemies seem to stick to one direction when it gets intense which I think helps.  If you have a vive, buy this now."",2.3 hrs on record																					(0.9 hrs at review time),N/A"
