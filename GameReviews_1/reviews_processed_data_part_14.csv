Not that the game needs a sequel, but the idea of a horror game that lasts as long as this one does and still keeps the tension going is astounding, rather than your 1hr-3hr long horror mainstays meant for twitch streamers and youtube thumbnails. If I had one gripe, it's that the prerendered cutscenes are in 30 fps when most people are likely running this at 60 or above, it makes it jarring and I'm not sure why this hasn't been changed. You might also be confused on some of the plot elements or setting if you haven't watched Alien or Aliens, but if you haven't done that, why are you playing this? Go watch the movies, they're classics. Well the first two at least. There's really not much more to say about this game that hasn't been said outside of the fact that this game is an absolute classic and a must play for Alien and horror fans.",15.9 hrs on record,N/A,
76561197983588742,1.0,Serious Sam 2,Recommended,"I want to start by saying I don't think this is a bad game, it's just a 'meh' one, and feels like the weakest out of the main series with the possible exception of 4 since I haven't played it. I would still recommend people who miss chaotic 90s shooters to check out the series as a whole. Serious Sam 2 leans into a lot more into the comedy than the prior games, and that's the main aspect that dates this game. It feels like it was written by children at times. And while there is the occasional funny scene, many of the jokes fall completely flat. Not to mention the character design of every NPC that isn't Sam is...bizarre. That being said this is more Serious Sam, so if you liked the other games it'll feel right at home. They even added in dual wielding of any combination of weapons (although you have to look up what button does it since the game does not tell you and I discovered the feature by accident) resulting in a lot of fun. But it can be frustrating that your weapons reset and the end of every world and sometimes it can take ages to get anything better than the double barrel shotgun. It's a great gun and all but Serious Sam always felt really fun in its chaotic need to jump from gun to gun depending on the situation.  This problem is heavily amplified on the final world, where 4 out of the 7 levels reset your weapons. They also patched in a gun that got cut from the original release, but it only appears in the second world, never to be seen again. I will say to its credit that the final level is the craziest I've played in the franchise so far, where its pretty much a nonstop 40 minute barrage of absolutely everything being thrown at you. Most of the other levels are about 8-15 minutes long. Maybe Im being a bit harsh on the humor though, yet finding giant piles of poo and two of the villagers boning in a outhouse, or all of the npc's having wacky, high pitches voices just isn't my cup of tea.",13.8 hrs on record,N/A,
76561197983588742,1.0,Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls,Recommended,"If you're among the many people that have recently discovered Danganronpa you might be wondering what this game is and if you should play it, and I don't blame you. All 3 Danganronpa games are great but the conclusion to the series is restricted to the D3 Anime and if you are craving more explanation of the story, particularly between D1 & 2, you might be wanting to dive into this. Well to start off this doesn't at all play like the others, its more like a third person action adventure staring two girls facing off against 5 children and their army of Monokumas. Initially I was worried that the kids would be one note and boring villains straight out of Kids Next Door that wanted to kill adults simply because 'adults are bad'. Turns out this was far, far from the truth, and this is easily the darkest game in the series, even going beyond the series, it's dark. Like ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up dark. The children are all severely traumatized and suffering from PTSD. The first 2 chapters might go the way you are expecting given the warning I just gave, with children literally piling the adult bodies, making displays, and relentlessly killing without a moments thought. But then everything changes in Chapter 3, and sets the tone for the problems throughout the rest of the game that make this game absolutely disgusting, abhorrent, and contains excessive sexualization of children, much of it played for humor. SPOILERS FOR THE REST OF THE REVIEW Chapter 3's focus is on the villain Kotoko Utsugi, a child actress who's mother frequently forced her into sexual assault by older men in exchange for money, citing envy over her daughter's youth. Now let's get one thing out of the way here, discussion about abuse is, while not encouraged, something I expect media to tackle at times. It opens peoples eyes to issues that might go ignored by others in society, and can at times help people come forward and confront their own abusers. Shows like Law and Order: Special Victims Unit are great at this, discussion is fine. However, shortly after she is introduced, and that backstory is established, the character falls over and we are given a shot of her underwear. All nuanced discussion is out the window, now it's an attempt at humor, disgusting humor. Kotoko then kidnaps our protagonist Komaru, and straps her into a machine that gropes her, and you have to play a minigame to stop yourself from being molested. THEN Toko shows up to save her and a fight ensures, to which Toko uses her scissors to attack, and landing hits results in cutting off Kotoko's clothing down to her underwear. For the rest of the game, Toko makes references to Kotoko taking Komaru's virginity. The scene was, without a doubt, revolting, but I at least held onto the hope that once the chapter was done and the villain was gone, the weird child abuse 'humor' would stop. It did not. Here are just a few examples of some of the other questionable things the game contains. - Komaru believes she can see ghosts because one time she woke up in the middle of the night to her teacher standing over her in bed, apologizing when he gets spotted. She only thinks it was a ghost because he quit his job the next morning and disappeared. - The leader of the resistance against the kids, you know the supposed good guys, says he isn't interested in Toko because he prefers his girls 'as young as possible'. - One of the Monokuma bears that can talk hugs one of the villain girls and makes several remarks about her chest. There's just so much sexual 'humor' in a game that was trying to talk about children with severe PTSD. Every one of the other kids is equally messed up as Kotoko, things such as being beaten by an alcoholic father, being forced to wear a mask because they were told they were so ugly peoples eyes would explode if they took it off, or being forced to study being kept up with stimulants for weeks on end. NONE of those are made jokes of, none are used for humor. The writer/director clearly has some strange thing going on. I know its Japan, I've played my fair share of games with weird fanservice, but this is going to another level to say that this game needs to be burned. If you really want to know what happens, watch the first cutscene, and the ending, that should cover it for you. Maybe read a synopsis.",19.6 hrs on record,N/A,
76561197983588742,1.0,Observer: System Redux,Recommended,"Observer: System Redux is an enhanced version of the original Observer made by the same studio behind Layers Of Fear. That in itself should tell you that this is a walking simulator of sorts, but instead of being about a mentally disturbed painter, we have a mentally disturbed cyberpunk detective who can jack into peoples minds. The premise is great, especially since the lead is voiced by the late Rutger Hauer of Blade Runner fame. His delivery really drives home the hopelessness of the environment, which is designed beautifully. It's not too long of a game, the 4 hours was a playthrough where I ended up ignoring the side content without even realizing it was there. It wasn't that difficult, though there were a couple of rooms where it took me a minute to find the 'press to advance the plot' button. Now onto what my cons of the game are. Do you know how most videogames nowadays have photosensitivity warnings? This is the only game I've ever actually seen outside of release day Cyberpunk 2077 to actually warrant such a warning. The game loves to throw potentially problematic visuals your way that would fail the Harding test if it was on TV. So you are someone who is even mildly epileptic, I'd be cautious playing this one. Also this is one of those horror games that decided 'sudden distorted loud noise out of left field' was an effective strategy for horror. Now there's a time and a place for it, but the highlight of the game, which is jacking into brains, is marred by just randomly shoving these sounds into your speakers/headphones without context just to rile you up instead of relying on it's visuals. Which is a shame, because the visuals in this game are splendid, even more so during these segments. But sudden loud noises are what makes horror feel cheap, and the game didn't need to rely on it as much as it does, the atmosphere is phenomenal here. I did hear some rumblings where if you owned the original you have to pay full price for the upgraded version unless you preordered it like I did, and that is a shameful, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ business practice.. But I think this is a fine game to pick up for $10 or less.",4.1 hrs on record,N/A,
76561197983588742,1.0,Wreckfest,Recommended,"Born from the days of Destruction Derby Raw and Flatout, Wreckfest is a physics driven racer with a heavy emphasis on destruction. You won't find Mazda's or Ferrari's here, instead you get a variety of junkers to race around a track and either destroy your competition or finish on top. Race types include traditional courses, as well as courses designed to encourage destruction, or outright destruction derbys where the last car standing wins. We are talking about every time of car ranging from what you might expect to see to school buses, big rigs, and even a guy riding on a sofa. You have single player and mulitplayer modes, and for those single player folks mod support with the steam workshop is extensive, allowing you to add hundreds of tracks and cars. Multiplayer has been an interesting experience. Given server browsers, some servers might favor straight forward racing while others might be okay with you just spinning your Bus around and trying to crash everyone going the proper way. In a way, it actually removes a lot of the stress from normal online racing games, in games like Forza you will probably get mad at the physical contact, but since it's expected and a core part of the experience here, you just can't get angry when 10 cars slam into a corner and cartwheel about. No one is safe. If there was to be a downside it's that after finishing career mode i still had nowhere near enough money to get the cars I had wanted, instead I got only the ones I needed to finish career mode. Funnily enough, if that bothers you like it irked me, there is a steam workshop mod that just unlocks everything.",231.2 hrs on record																					(21.3 hrs at review time),N/A,
76561197983588742,1.0,FINAL FANTASY XV WINDOWS EDITION,Recommended,"A lot of times I feel 'meh' about a game and wish that Steam would give me the option to post as such, I give the game the benefit of the doubt and give it a thumbs up, but no more, this game has too many issues. That being said, yes I did enjoy this game, even got a bit teary eyed at the end, but there are too many design decisions that got in the way during my 42 hour playthrough. For example, why can I accept only `10 hunter quests at a time? Before patches it was only 1 at a time which was even more baffling, but the titular hunter quests at give you a ton of xp can only be accepted at particular locations near where the monster is, yet you can redeem finished monster quests anywhere. The amount of side quests that open up in chapter 3 is staggering, and the trend continues until chapter 8, allowing you to become incredibly overpowered if you want to. I'm a 'almost' completionist type of gamer, and like to do all of the side quests before moving on. That combined with one particular hotel that doubles the xp you earned meant that i could run around for 10 hours, finish quests until they got too hard, then sleep at said hotel and gain 20 levels at once. The story quests became a joke until the final chapter, with me killing most enemies in just a single combo. Oh and if you want to get even more overpowered, visit the steam workshop and download custom outfits and weapons, you'll have end game gear right away. I think what really bothers me though is that this game gets so close, so close to being something that I would demand people play. But the fun open world gameplay gets closed off after chapter 8, then the story basically rockets off to get to it's conclusion and I can't help but feel like it's rushed. At it's launch the game's story was so poorly explained that they actually had to add documents thrown on the ground to give further context to what was happening and frankly it still feels like it's not enough. If you were to ask me of the finer story details beyond 'bad guy wants revenge' i'd be lost, and the game seems to practically scream at you to watch/read all of it's supplementary materials to understand the plot fully. For example there's a cutscene at the end of chapter 1 that looks phenomenal, but it was muted and instead had just soundtrack playing it. I thought, 'woah that looks incredible i want to see more of that!' but what do you know, it's from the movie. Also during particular bits of the story your party members will disappear and when they come back go 'you won't BELIEVE what happened to me while I was gone' and guess what, now you have to play the DLC to understand. It is included on the pc version, but man does it feel forced in. I haven't even really gotten into my gameplay qualms yet, like how jump is the same button on a controller as interact. So I arrive at a location to talk to someone and instead proceed to jump infront of them 10 times. Or when you use your ultimate ability, if you hit the button again within the time limit to do a sort of final attack with your teammates, but guess the amount of times the button failed to produce any results. Also this is yet another FF that should've used 12's Gambit system, as you can't control your teammates unless you unlock the ability to do so. Ultimately most of the squad felt useless, especially when  I was running around the open world, got into a fight, and suddenly my teammates were half a mile away from me, not keeping up. I really wanted to like you more than I  did FFXV. You're not a bad game, you're a misguided one that had everything going for it yet made some bonkers decisions along the way. I hope XVI learns some heavy lessons from this and provides a more solid experience.",42.8 hrs on record,N/A,
76561197983588742,1.0,Persona 4 Golden,Recommended,"Hoo boy (wait, wrong Persona game) The Persona series overall is one of my favorites but I am still extremely cautious when recommending it to other people. The formula is great, but it is definitely not for everyone. This is basically a school life simulator with a rock-paper-scissors rpg mixed in. This means you will live out an entire school year day by day, and some of those months have way more going on than others. Someone unfamiliar with the franchise might be frustrated with 1. How long the game holds your hand until you are truly free to do what you want. And 2. The slower months and time in between the game's dungeons that unlock. The 64 hours I have in the game is 1 complete playthrough to the true ending with little faffing about. For the uninitiated, this is an 'expanded' edition of Persona 4, and as someone who played Persona 4 about 3 times before playing this one, I can confirm that the expanded material is dense and definitely worth your time if you are a fan of the original game. Where it might be hard for people is those who came from Persona 5/Royal. The style is lacking by comparison, as is the obvious downgrade in graphics. You don't have guns, there's less elements to play with, and the tag team attacks that were so flashy in Royal aren't as stylish here. Also the dungeons go from stylish heists to a bunch of randomly generated floors, usually around 9-10 per dungeon.  You are playing a game from the 2000s after all. What makes Persona 4 stand out however is it's music and cast. Golden does a great job at expanding both of these from the original, as you get a plethora of new music tracks and the cast spends a lot more time with each other, even if half the time those extra hangouts are just more girl fanservice. I do want to point out something that might or might not bother people however, and it is the games handling of gay and trans topics. The game touches on both with the lightest of brushes, with two characters at separate times being set in scenarios where a 'shadow self' of them speaks out their true feelings. In both instances, the big secret is that one is gay and the other is trans, but upon finishing their respective dungeons their end conclusion about themselves is ""oh I'm not ACTUALLY gay/trans I'm just trying to find my fit in society"". Which is half assed when the other characters confront some pretty tough aspect of themselves on the topics of existentialism, para social relationships, and hating the countryside life. For the other characters, they all go 'yeah you're right I'm just in denial of myself' but for Kanji, the gay jokes continue to be played up for the whole rest of the story to the point where you might feel like you're watching one of those rom coms from the same era of media. Again, if this doesn't bother you, it just comes out as just bad writing, but it might upset others. But hey, that aside, it's still one of my favorite games, even if Persona 5 Royal ultimately ends up being the better game between the two.",64.6 hrs on record,N/A,
76561197983588742,2.0,NBA 2K21,Recommended,"It's not so much that this is a bad basketball game. It definitely has it's merits. But it heavily depends on what you want out of a basketball game that will determine if you will enjoy it. In short, if you want a multiplayer, online, competative, balanced basketball experience, do NOT pick this up. If you want to play the next gen version of the game, do NOT pick this up, maybe next year. But if you want to just either make your own player, grind your way up through the NBA, and ignore the multiplayer component, it's not half bad, it's okay. It's even okay if you go into the MyTeam mode of PC, so long as you stick to the single player mode, since the currency, MT, is way easier to obtain and the cards seem to go for cheaper based on what I've seen in the PS5/4 market. But still expect the overall feeling from the devs that they just don't care, this especially is true if you played previous years, where the more immersive side of the game was sort of expected to be there, making them stick out with their omission. Things like adding shoes as the season goes on (they heavily push other clothes for mp only though) your mycareer character interacting with other nba stars on the regular, the pregame show featuring Shaq. It all manages to feel barebones, but typically during this time of year I see this title for $20 or less, which if you are new I think is worth it, sink your hours to it, then maybe see if next year's version improves or not. That being said, always expect multiplayer to be trash on PC, not to mention one of the more toxic communities I've ever witnessed.

God I am a stupid man for not playing this sooner. Essentially, this is a Metroidvania akin to Hollow Knight, swapping the gothic Tim Burton esque art style for something I'd label coming out of the top tier animation studios today. Not just that but the soundtrack is a sweeping orchestra that excels in every area.

76561197983588742,2.0,Max Payne 3,Recommended,"Can I still advocate for a 'meh' option? The Max Payne trilogy is a fantastic series of games that played with the bullet time concept at it's height. What does end up sticking out though is it's third installment for feeling like more of a departure from the comic book film noir feeling to more of a near clone of the Denzel Washington movie 'Man On Fire'. It feels like an odd choice to take Max from New York to South America, but the game does things both right and terribly wrong. For what's good, bullet time gameplay is always a treat with a few exceptions that I'll get to later, and the soundtrack by HEALTH also stands out. Max still does his wallowing narration although you do end up with more goofy lines like 'this is like baghdad with bikini's'. The game plays heavily on now Max isn't really that bright and is being played like a fiddle for being a dumb American inserting himself into another country's problems. This actually comes through especially in the subtitles, where they don't translate any of the Portuguese that other characters speak. On one hand its a nice fish out of water feeling, but I would've liked the option to have it translated. The visual style also stands out, where the cutscenes constantly flash brightness and glitch out giving the feeling of Max's hangover stabbing again into his brain. It's a visual style I yet to really see replicated well and solidifies it's tone. What does stink can be the shooting physics at times, while bullet time is great sometimes Max might hit a table or wall mid dive and proceeds to ragdoll around in the usual Rockstar physics engine way. Also, you spend a TON of time in cutscenes, including some you can't skip because it sets up the action. Someone actually posted a guide here that breaks down how long you spend watching cutscenes and its not a good look for such a shooter heavy game. It's not Yakuza or Metal Gear Solid 4 long, but when you die and reload the checkpoint, sometimes those cutscenes still come up and get in the way. It is a shame that multiplayer is dead though, I remember it being fun back in 2013 when I first played it. So if you've played Max Payne 1 and 2, and are wondering where it goes from here, it doesn't really go anywhere. It's another installment, but doesn't advance the character as much as the game thinks it does. It's prettier for sure! And if you liked the gameplay of 1&2 enough to have that stand on it's own go for it. But if you are experiencing the series for the first time, I would sooner recommend you play the first two before deciding to pick this one up.",26.0 hrs on record,N/A,

76561197983588742,2.0,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,Recommended,"I know most of these reviews just say 'hey it's Halo' but I really want to break something down. It is 6 story campaigns, 6 multiplayer games with tones of modes, and co-op modes that are so full of content that you won't believe this costs $40 dollars. There's nothing more to be said on if this is a good deal for the money, it's out of the question. There's just too much here and we aren't even paying full price. Sure we are missing Halo 5 Guardians to have all of the games in one collection, but on the plus side, we are missing Halo 5 Guardians. This is one of those series that I do believe everyone should at least play once if they're an FPS fan, right there with Half Life, Goldeneye, Doom, Quake etc. There's arguments to be made on if things hold up as well (looking at you Halo CE, you have some incredible MP maps but others that make me think you were a bit sleepy at the wheel.) But the series is undoubtedly important, and permanently serves as a monument to the culture of the 2000s. And this isn't even coming from someone wrapped up in the nostalgia for it, I actually only played the first one, which when viewed with the entire package stands out as the most obtuse.  It had a major hand in shaping both the Singleplayer and Multiplayer landscape of this millennium. I do think that the single player story is perhaps the main thing that hasn't really aged well. Video game writing in general has taken massive leaps in quality and Halo 4, despite being more recent, never really picked up that slack. So don't expect to be crying tears at the end of any particular game. But the soundtrack is still gorgeous and there's nothing like the shifts from the linear corridors of ships to completely opening up with vehicles and a huge area to explore, The multiplayer though is something that still feels fairly unique to the franchise. The time to kill opponents is way higher than other popular shooters at the time such as the Call of Duty and Battlefield franchises that frankly I really don't understand why they were compared that way back in the way. But hey, people also were way more into the 'console wars' back then. What this game does need to fully capture the spirit of MP gaming in the 2000s is a Custom Games browser, which was supposed to come out a couple weeks ago but has been met with delays. But at least it's almost here, and the custom games is when the creativity of the community using the map editor 'Forge' really comes to shine.

76561197983588742,2.0,Pinball FX3,Recommended,"My time right now says 14 hours but I'll add on another 25 from Pinball FX2. This really is THE pinball game to play, before they started introducing real tables from Williams I probably would've said that the game is great for fun casual play but not for hardcore pinball lovers that go for completing all of the missions on a table, now however I can firmly say that this is a great title to pickup. HOWEVER, if you are new, you have to know that you only get a couple of tables at the start for free, everything else is DLC. That being said, table packs go on sale every week (i think there was a pack for 99 cents just recently). If you consider the cost of actually playing pinball, paying 1-5$ for 3 tables that you can infinitely play is a great deal and before you know it you have more tables than you know what to do with. So I highly advise against buying packs unless they go on sale (I am kicking myself for missing the Bethesda tables sale last month) There's many original tables, as well as licensed ones. Expect way too many Marvel and Star Wars tables, but other additions like Archer, Back To The Future, and the Jurassic Park tables mix things up well enough. But the Williams licensing has taken the game to another level, with perfect recreations of classic pinball tables. It should be noted that these are way harder than the non-Williams tables, so you might want to hold off on picking them up until you get your feet wet with the physics. I have heard that the latest pack has some performance issues, but I haven't experienced it myself. That being said, and this is likely not the devs fault but I licensing one, but several tables from Pinball FX2 did not carry over to 3, such as the South Park table. While I can always install FX 2 to play it, it's nice having one massive collection and not have tables disappear in between games, which frankly makes me a bit nervous for FX 4.

76561197983588742,2.0,Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days,Recommended,"I've played a lot of bad games, even intentionally, as I always have believed there's things to be learned and even found humor in just how bad it is. But let me tell you, there is not one. single. redeeming thing about Kane & Lynch 2. For some reason, the developers went with this idea to have a cameraman follow K&L in the journey, however, neither characters ever acknowledge that this camera man exists. When it's the three of you in an elevator, one of them explicitly says 'We're just two white guys in an elevator', so one might think maybe this camera man doesn't actually exist? Except for the fact that when they get captured, one of the police comes over an puts his hands over the camera, acknowledging that this is infact a real person. So why does this camera man exist? They exist solely to provide the most nauseating experience in gaming. It's a cameraman with full on parkinson's disease with the framing ability of an orangutan. Every cutscene is dealt with dizzying camera movements, wildly spinning around in circles, typically pointed at nothing in particular, and removing you from the ability to actually see what is happening, like someone came from the school of the Bourne series. The game also censors nudity and headshots (but not all headshots) as if I'm watching this video on  youtube, and the loading icon is the buffering icon in case you needed to be reminded that you could be watching something more entertaining on youtube instead. There's several types of guns in this game, pistols which are fairly competent, sub machine guns which feel like I'm shooting a garden hose when pointed at any target that is greater than 10 feet away. Assault rifles that are the go to, shotguns for when it's 30 minutes in the game and you could've swore the weapon icon showed that it wasn't a shotgun. Sniper rifles that don't have a scoped sight despite enemies getting scopes when they aim at you, and a couple of others. This is a cover based shooter where cover occasionally will just do nothing at all and you’ll still get blasted by the enemies directly in front of you. Also I had dozens of occasions where I would literally see them spawn in by just popping into existence. They gave you a sprinting ability in this game, which immediately makes the game look like it's being thrown through a dryer cycle. Half the time you can't see enemies approaching or even what direction you are going in. One might think to simply not use it then, however the game throws numerous large open fields that you can either spend triple the time going through or just deal with quick motion sickness. Oh and there's numerous chase and 'hurry up' sequences throughout the game. It's unavoidable. During the numerous shootouts, K&L incoherently shout at each other despite how small of a room they are in or close they are to each other, and as if they constantly need to remind the audience (or the camera man) who is who. The typical dialog exchange goes as follows. ""KANE!"" ""LYNCH! ""I CAN'T DO THIS KANE AGHFBHTH!"" ""SHOOT THEM LYNCH"" I want to point out that I did not do a typo, Lynch will randomly incoherently ramble and shout throughout the game, and the subtitles won't cover it despite everything else. So you might think he's still the incredibly unbalanced psychotic man from the last game, however this time he seemingly got himself a girlfriend. We see her for maybe one scene before we learn her true purpose, to get raped and murdered off screen. This girlfriend character was already completely unbelievable enough but now I have to believe that Lynch cared about her. Lynch did not need an additional reason to murder people, that's literally all his character is, an incredibly violent, non empathetic man. Oh and how about Kayne? He doesn't really need to be there, he exists solely to remind you that the Jenny ending from the last game is canon as he whines about the fact that she still won't talk to him. Speaking of the endings and the story by the way it couldn’t be more garbage. K&L are in town for an arms deal but it goes wrong when, before the arms deal even takes place, they shoot someone’s girlfriend in a completely unrelated shootout. What happens after that is boring shootout after shootout where everyone from the people they were with to the arms dealer, the police, the military, then the gang all try to hunt them down and that’s what leads to this games woman in the fridge moment. SPOILERS After the girl’s death K&L decide that they can’t win this fight and flee, only to be caught and placed on helicopters, they then see the lead bad guy’s skyscrapper and decide to hijack the chopper and attack it, despite literally saying a moment ago there is no chance they will win. So they put a gun to the pilot’s head to fly along the side of the building while they shoot, and yet the other police choppers decide to try to ram you like they’re playing Battlefield. So I guess K&L literally found the most cowardly pilot in the force. After landing in the site they shoot their way to the final boss while the other police helicopters start shooting up the skyscraper. Oh so where is the boss? In a room that is completely shot up to pieces, completely by himself. He dies in a cutscene. I’m seriously getting angry just remembering this crap. The final mission has you hijacking a commercial plane where it just ends after you succeed. Oh and the cameraman gets left behind on the airstrip. END SPOILERS I could site the game's incredibly short length as a negative but I might have to say that it's the sole positive, that I was spared from an eternal torment. This should not be bought by anyone, it is a closet torture device meant to drive its viewer insane. At least they got through the whole game without making a single Chinese racial slur.

The screaming kids are gone, the game runs well, and the movement system is a great addition that actually requires you to get good at the game, whereas most shooters have a relatively lower learning curve. There's no absurdly overpowered killstreaks, no crazy broken guns, and the specialists add some much needed variety. It's far from perfect, the PC community mainly plays TDM and DOM, which sucks for people that enjoy trying other modes. Supply drops were added, which wasn't a huge problem until they added weapons to them. However, they're adding daily and weekly challenges that guarantee weapon drops, so they're somewhat remedied the situation. Seriously Treyarch knows how to treat PC crowds. Activision may screw up things like the supply drop system, but pcdev and the PC support team really try to make up for it with frequent double xp/cryptokey weekends. I've seen people on the steam forums complain about cheaters, but I've only encountered 1 so far, its not as plague ridden as some seem to claim. Zombies is also great, seriously this is the first cod where I've actually liked it. I guess what I would say is, I wish more people would give COD a chance again, it doesn't play the same as older titles, the community has (slightly) approved, by that i mean no screaming kids, and above all, its fun. It's not going to blow your mind, but its dumb fun, which is sometimes exactly what I want out of a game.",365.8 hrs on record																					(311.4 hrs at review time),N/A,
76561197983588742,3.0,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,Recommended,"For the uninitiated, The Witcher series, based on a Polish book series of the same name, follows Geralt, a witcher, which is a mutated human specializing in monster hunting. While the first two games were about tracking down a crime indicate that stole from you, then tracking down an assassin who targeted kings, The Witcher 3 follows Geralt’s attempts to track down his sort-of adopted daughter, Ciri. Those who have not played 1 & 2 get a series of questions posed to them early on in the game that help you choose some critical choices that occurred in those games. There is also a massive character journal giving background on just about everyone written by Geralt’s friend, Dandelion. However, while the opening prologue establishes a fantastic understanding between Geralt and 2 freshly introduced character’s, Yennefer and Ciri, new players might be a bit lost when it comes to some of the prominent characters from the last two games, such as Triss, Zoltan and Dandelion. Your level of immersion in the Witcher universe is entirely up to you, but should you choose to delve deep, you won’t be disappointed. While the last two games took place in a series of medium-large environments, Witcher 3 takes the full step towards completely open world. One can’t help but think of Skyrim in this situation, and it’s very easy to see similarities. However, the game never feels like its stealing concepts. I can set my marker 300 m away and still encounter a guarded treasure, a monster with a bounty on its head, and a woman in desperate need of her lost frying pan on the way. It’s a game that rewards those that discover exploration and curiosity. Yet despite running around and doing those secondary tasks, you never quite feel like you’re just grinding, its genuinely engaging to walk into a new town and discover the people and their problems. I myself have yet to find a single ‘go to the forest and kill x amount of x’ quests. Along the way you pick up recipes for various bombs, materials, swords, armor, and mutagens that can enhance your abilities. These come together in a crafting system with a massive amount of ingredients. The problem that can occur is that few hints are given on where to find particular plants or materials. Even further unexplained is the dismantling system, where you can break down materials into smaller, different pieces. The big feature that the Witcher series got known for was its choice and consequence system, which went the extra mile to make sure that you were constantly never truly sure if you were making the right decision. To prevent you from simply reloading the game upon making a bad choice, the game is written so that often times you won’t know the consequence of your actions until you encounter them much later on. The game also features a Sherlock Holmes/Batman style ‘Witcher Sense’, which highlights special objects in the environment that you can use. Many times when you pick up a bounty against a monster, it starts at the scene where it last attacked, it’s up to you to figure out what did it, and to pick up it’s trail. Personally I found this feature to be a little bit overused, but it is still engaging nonetheless. The combat varies heavily on what difficulty you set it on. On the lowest difficulty, you may just get away with hacking and slashing, however on anything higher and you have to rely on your tools, movement, spells, timing and more. Geralt is extremely mobile and on top of parrying attacks he can also roll and quick dodge, albiet the controls for quick dodge can be a bit awkward. The brilliant thing about the monster design in this game is that no one is given visible weak points to exploit. In order for Geralt to be most effective, witchers need to prepare. There’s a bestiary that keeps track of the various weaknesses of each of the monsters. Being able to survive comes down to playing smart, and preparing beforehand. Higher level play demands patience and knowledge of your opponent. That’s not to say that the lower difficulty levels ruin the game, it’s just that they feel like two separate experiences. In previous Witcher games, there was always a game that served as a side quest. Witcher 1 & 2 featured dice poker, which didn’t have a whole lot of strategy to it but wasn’t a chore to play. Witcher 3 adds in a card game named Gwent in the mindset of Hearthstone to play, with 4 separate decks to build and use to compete against dozens of NPC’s. This is a massive step up from the previous games, and is definitely a worthwhile side quest that takes much more skill and understanding of the game to succeed in. As far as the graphics in the game go, it is absolutely stunning to look at, albeit a very difficult game to run with the settings maxed out. The Witcher 3 still manages to be a very stunning looking game. The character detail stands out the most, and the main characters in the game have a noticeably higher quality level of motion capture compared to the village NPC’s. Even small things like Geralt’s beard can astound, which grows overtime unless you have it shaven. However, the game is not without its faults, most of these are minor however, since this has been one of the better launches I’ve seen recently. Falling damage in the game is massively overpowered, taking away large chunks of Geralt’s health for dropping down 1.5 stories. Your horse can get stuck on odd parts of geometry. The swimming /diving controls can be very awkward. Sometimes during the Witcher Sense, Geralt can run, other times he can’t. There’s the aforementioned glitch in the Gwent game that I experienced, as well as the rare crash or two. The soundtrack, while amazing, can get a bit repetitious during combat. There’s a vocal track that sounded amazing in the trailers but when you hear that lady frantically singing for the 30th time on the way to the nearest town, you really wish you could tell her to just calm down. But as I mentioned, the games faults tend to be more on the minor side, and even those that are there could be patched out. So if you’re looking for an absolutely massive RPG with an engaging world and characters look no further than The Witcher 3, and while you’re at it, pick up 1 & 2, which are often on sale for $5 and under. This is CD Project RED’s magnum opus, their ultimate build up for the franchise that PC gamers have loved since 2007. You will absolutely get your moneys worth with this game, and will not be disappointment with the sheer amount of treasures to hunt, people to kill, sorceress’s to screw, and frying pans to be found. 9.3/10",194.6 hrs on record																					(70.6 hrs at review time),N/A,
76561197983588742,3.0,Fallout 4,Recommended,"It’s been years since we last stepped foot in the apocalyptic wasteland, and while there certainly is a sense a familiarity in Bethesda’s latest entry in the Fallout franchise, it can’t help but feel like the start of a new era of Fallout. Fans and newcomers alike have plenty to enjoy in this massive game, and it’s there’s plenty game to go around. The only thing that might stop you from enjoying Fallout 4 over the previous entries is how married you are to it’s previous gameplay mechanics. Fallout 4 brings about a new focus in storytelling with the introduction of a voiced protagonist. Accompanying this is a more personal, stronger main story, as well as a tighter focus on who your character can be. In previous Fallout games, you could be a bumbling idiot, or an evil overlord bent on destruction of everything, this is a bit toned down in F4, the new dialogue system always limits you to just 4 choices, and the ability to have certain dialogue depending on your character’s stats is mostly drawn back with the exception of charisma checks. The absence of skills in favor of a more streamlined leveling system means that your character isn’t going to pick up a gun and not be able to use it, or perform terribly with it. Your character is a concerned parent seeking their son, and you branch out from there. Instead of skills in previous games, most stats are tied to the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system, and extra abilities come from perks, which function as usual, except this time you can find bonus perks in magazines hidden in the world, as well as bonus perks for maxing out your companions relationships. And speaking of those, the karma system is gone as well, replaced with doing actions that your companion will like. That does mean however, that you can be very schizophrenic with your choices without really feel like it’s having the impact it used to, especially if you don’t have a companion with you. But while we are on combat, it’s worth noting that the shooting mechanics are the best they have ever been, guns feel responsive and the hundreds of mods you can attach to them means that even that early shotgun you found at level 5 can still be a force of nature if you keep it updated. The VATS system returns but no longer freezes time, but instead slows it, again a more grounded choice but it feels more welcome than the changes in dialogue. Power armor is no longer just another piece of armor to equip, but a suit you get into, with the same level of customization as the guns and other armor pieces, it almost encourages you to collect as many as you can, so sure enough, I have a hangar full of power armor suits that would make Tony Stark’s heart melt. But for the first time, power armor really sounds like, well, power armor. Funding all of these upgrades is an increased focus on finding junk in the wasteland and scrapping it for materials. This is probably the best change from previous entries as it encourages exploration beyond just finding weapons armor and stimpacks. However, scrapping all of your junk in your inventory in the most efficient way possible often times means going to a settlement, dropping all of your junk in the ground, and selecting each and every piece for scrap. A ‘scrap all’ function would be incredibly welcome. Speaking of settlements, Fallout 4 has a bit of a base building mode, where you build houses, power, water, food and defenses for settlements to keep them safe. It can get incredibly addicting but, without the right perks, your resources are exclusive to each base, and while I eventually got the perk that lets me setup supply lines in between the bases, this led to me focusing only on one or two settlements, instead of ones across the map as it was probably intended. Beyond this, you have the story and quests, and while I did mention the main story as being stronger, the overall world fells as if it’s lacking some truly memorable characters in the world, with the exception of some of your companions. Fetch quests or ones simply boiled down to ‘go here and kill some guys’ are abundant, especially when you might find yourself on a repeating quest chain against your will, with your quest giver not even presenting the option to turn down the next quest, I’m looking at you Preston, you annoying bastard. I have yet to do all of the side quests in the game, or finish exploring the map in its entirety, so I’m holding my thoughts on the side quest quality until later, but there certainly are some memorable side quests, as well as great rewards for doing them. Graphically, it won’t blow your computer away from Project Cars, Witcher 3 or Arkham Knight, but it still looks great, using a modified version of the engine that ran Skyrim. Some of the age shows however, because while environments certainly are the best they have ever looked, animations are still a bit stiff and sometimes can just outright break. Speaking of breaking, F4 has significantly less bugs than the last 2 Fallout games did at launch, but that doesn’t mean it got away from them. Some quest bugs, graphical bugs, and the occasional need to restart arise. It’s been a lot worse, but still has room for improvement. If this is your first Fallout game, dive right in, I guarantee you will have a fantastic time. If you really loved the previous Fallout games, I want you to take a step back for a moment, and ask yourself why you enjoyed them so much. The role playing side is downplayed, but the exploration is as great as ever. The skills and karma are gone, but the moment to moment gameplay feels the best it’s ever been. It’s different, is the point I’m getting at, and with a new console generation typically comes to changes in the formula. Bethesda clearly wanted a tighter focus on character and story this time around, but if that doesn’t bother you, then go crazy. 8.5/10",198.7 hrs on record																					(73.9 hrs at review time),N/A,
76561197983588742,3.0,Rocket League®,Recommended,"UPDATE: Rocket League has since added plenty of additional modes and ranked features that make this game an absolute necessecity for any gamer out there, experienced or otherwise. To put the base concept of Rocket League out there, it’s a simplified version of soccer involving up to 8 total players driving rocket powered RC cars. You pick up boost on the field, launch yourself in the air, and drive up the side walls, it’s a casual, simplifield take on the soccer experience. However, it is absolutely astounding how much the game will grab you, and how exhilirating it is to expereince the chaoticness that can happen. How much this basic concept has such strong legs that the game is able to get away with a lack of features compared to other sports games. It hardly needs them. That’s not to say the game lacks features at all. For starters, you have 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 standard modes, all of which can feel significantly different when it comes to field control, and teamplay. There’s ranked modes as well, but these are far more limited, you have 1v1, ranked duo 2v2, and solo 3v3. A game like this is definitely needs ranked 3v3 teams and possibly 4v4 teams, but don’t worry lads, within 2 days of release, the game was picked up by ESL. In fact, the first EU cup for the game is taking place today, including, and I ♥♥♥♥ you not, a team named PlsHaveMercy going against No Mercy. I know who my money is on. Outside of the online play, you have an exhibition mode for quick games against bots, a season mode, drills to hone your skills, a replay mode to edit your favorite victories together, and your garage to customize your cars. You unlock parts as you play such as new tires, cars, paint, decals, boost trails, and hats (you didn’t think you could get away from hats could you?) that you earn nearly every game from playing. The customization is a nice touch, but the majority of time you will be playing this game will mostly be online, going to the garage inbetween matches. That isn’t to say you will never stop playing online, since the game’s servers can occasionally be extremely laggy, but to be fair, there’s good reason for this. On Tuesday, Rocket League launched for $20 on PC, of you have PS+ on PS4, you can play it for free right now, add in Twitch and you had a game that went from 0 players to over 120,000 players in just a couple of days, completely overwhelming the developers expectations, and thus their twitter, their forums, and of course their servers, leading to some significant outages. The game has completely taken over twitch, and is now the one of the top sellers on steam. What myself, and many others will be wondering, is the lasting power of this game. It has significant potential to be a big esports title despite its casual nature. But current lack of support for ranked 3v3 or 4v4 teams is a pretty major disappointment. We will have to see what the developer does down the line, their new found popularity is bound to have some development changes outside of the already announced customization DLC. I know the sports genre is a tough sell on PC, probably the most difficult, but few will be disappointed in the gameplay that Rocket League offers. It’s highly addictive gameplay has already been noted by many, and ESL’s presence will soon spread its way over to PC. Today’s tournament is PS4 exclusive, but PC support and tournaments will soon be making its way to PC, and yes, Deadly Gaming will be competing.

76561197983588742,3.0,Saints Row IV: Re-Elected,Recommended,"At first I was concerned that this game wasn't going to be much, I was worried the super powers weren't going to be fun. I was worried this was just going to feel like DLC, I was wrong. It's astounding how much super powers add to this game, I don't even care that the game is set in the same city since the powers make the game play completely different, vehicles take a complete backseat. Although you still can play music from the radio stations, now it just plays wherever you can go, which makes it really awesome when you get in a big fight on the streets and you have heavy electronic music blasting. The characters are all there, the humor is all there, and it went full on crazy without holding back. Everything has been building up to this game, it really feels like this game is the collective result of everything that was learned during development of the last 3 saints row games. The only question is, what will they do now? P.S. There was a rumour that was haunting this game for a long time, that the scrapped DLC 'Enter The Dominatrix' was taken from Saints Row 3 and made into Saints Row 4. That's incorect, they looked at the contents of the DLC and decided it fit into the crazies of saints row 4 and made it DLC for that game.
