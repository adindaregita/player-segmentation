76561198012450682,1,N/A,Recommended,"Easy idle baking game, I've played many idle games & this one's easy to understand & play.  Like other idle games there are microtransactions that would make the game less grindy, but in no way is this pay to win, and  Idle Baker Boss does feel less grindy than any other idles I've played, if you enjoy the game i recommend joining the discord, lots of players on there to help with tips and the dev is active on there too",517.4 hrs on record																					(40.6 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198012450682,1,N/A,Recommended,"This game is a great way to combine two play styles of idle/active.  You control these strange creatures called derps, you breed them to make better and more derps so that you can produce cookies to upgrade things, build an army and to do research to earn points to upgrades skills, theres two skill trees, one that focuses on idle another on active play, but you can upgrade both, at the time of writing this my steam playtime is quite low, but i played on Kongregate for a long time and am so happy its come to steam And while there ARE real money transactions, you will NOT be forced into spending money in order to get all the good stuff, you can easily get it for free, how long that takes will simply depend on your playstyle and your patience level",16.0 hrs on record																					(1.4 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198012450682,1,N/A,Recommended,I love this game, easy to learn & challenging to master. The matches are quick and there's lots of different tactics to gain victory so it doesn't get repetitive. Single player option as well as the option to play with friends who own the game or a randomly selected real person, challenge mode as well and quests to complete to gain coins in order to buy more card, i did buy this in a sale, but to be honest, if you like card games then the full price is worth it too, easy to learn & challenging to master.

Fate has 'created' you, following his daily instructions, and with tips picked up from your mobile phone, you have to decide on the fate of various people from the profiles provided, its not an easy job, sometimes fates instructions conflict with the info from your phone, its up to you to decide the best route to take in order for the world not to end up in ruins! if fate is pleased with you each day he will pay you, and you can spend this money in mortimers shop on a variety of items, some are cosmetic, and some help with the game, be sure to visit him often! There are a bunch of fun achievements to get, some easy, some hard and some in between Artwork is cool and the game has a jolly soundtrack I played this games demo, which alone was brilliant, so was very excited to buy the full game, and i was not disappointed!

76561198012450682,1,N/A,Recommended,"Demo Review: Although this is only the demo so far, this game is really fun! you are the grim reaper, and your boss, fate, gives you a few profiles each day of different people and you have to decide who lives or dies, fate gives you instructions (rules) each day to follow, such as mark x amount for death, and your in game mobile phone buzzes with some info to help you make your choices, as following fates daily instructions may not always be the best course of action for the world, you decide! but dont annoy him too much or you will get fired lol Cant wait for the full release next week! if the full game is as awesome as the demo then i will be a very happy woman :D",4.0 hrs on record,N/A

76561198012450682,2,N/A,Recommended,"Do you like dice games? card/deck building games? and games that involve a certain amount of strategy? then this is a game for you! You play as a dice working against lady luck in order to get through the dungeons where you will come across various opponents, there are 6 different dice you can play as, each with their own special type of ability, there are 6 episodes for each dice and each episode has 5 levels with a boss fight at the end, each level within an episode has a different feature that will make it more challenging for you, but with practice at different strategies you can overcome this to beat the boss There are many different cards to collect and power up, and the graphics of the game are rather cute This game is basically really fun and i hope that we see a sequel one day :D",906.5 hrs on record																					(6.6 hrs at review time),N/A

If you was a fan of the blackwell series and shardlight  then you will enjoy this game, great storyline with more than 1 possible outcome in a variety of situations, great characters, great voice acting, some puzzles really easy and others not so easy so a good mix I also loved the fact that there were 2 major storyline events that took me totally by surprise, so great writing guys :D In fact, i loved this game so much that i think it would be great if it could become a series just like blackwell was, please please please Wadjet Eye Games, your games are great and the characters in Unavowed are definetly ones id love to see again, especially kaykay :D",12.4 hrs on record																					(12.4 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198012450682,2,N/A,Recommended,"Early Access / Beta review Being a big fan of the mobile version, i was very happy to hear they were putting the game on steam, and was super excited to be part of the beta testing. It dont matter if you have never seen the tv show this game is based on, as you will still enjoy it and be able to follow whats going on You are responsible for opening up various business's in Sunnyvales trailer park, use the money you earn to get more customers which give out bonus's of character and business cards which you use to upgrade your business's & characters There are tasks to complete which will open up a car's trunk and give rewards of money, cards or liqour Liqour is the currency used to upgrade your charcters and business's and can also be earned in the car trunk which you can open every 2 hours There are also weekly events where you can earn liqour, new characters to provide extra bonus's and also hash coins with are a special type of currency used for time skips, extra liqour and special trunks, tho it is best to save the hash for the weekly event, the weekly events are not in the beta, but the devs have said it will be in early access The game is not cross platform, so you cant link the mobile version with steam version, but i like that, as it means i can have double the fun :D Edit since early access : Laheys trunk now opens every 2 hours giving more chance for liqour & cards and devs have also added a daily trunk which you open every 24 hours which gives up to 420 liqour and more cards! Also when reviewing please try and remember this game is still in early access, so it natural there will be some bugs which the devs are doing their best to work on, alot of the reviews on here are unfairly harsh as have slated the game after only being released for early access after a few hours/days, since release there have been loads of tweaks and updates to the game that make it better and the devs ARE continuing to work on it :D I play both the mobile and steam version and i definetly think the steam version is better Long story short this game is great and you should definetly give it a try!","1,586.4 hrs on record																					(471.5 hrs at review time)",N/A
76561198012450682,2,N/A,Recommended,"Discovered this gem in the recent winter sale, but knowing what i know now i would have been quite happy to pay full price! When this appeared in my discovery queue i thought it looked interesting, then i discovered the devs had also been responsible for the BLACKWELL series, so that was it for me, i purchased this game right away! You play Amy Wellard,  a young woman trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic world, you are all alone as you have no surviving family, and the world is plagued by an illness called Green Lung, the goverment control vaccines and you have to do jobs for them in order to get a lottery ticket to try and win one, but even if you are lucky enough to win one there is the downside that they only last a month...... I wont say anymore as it would give too much away, but its a brilliant game with a fab storyline, but if you loved BLACKWELL then you will love this, buy it now, you wont regret it!! Also the devs have another game in the pipeline called UNAVOWED, cant wait to try that game as im sure it will be as awesome as this one :D",8.6 hrs on record																					(8.5 hrs at review time),N/A

Its a funny, mad and crazy game, the best thing now of course is that you can easily switch between new/old grapics just by pressing a button. The puzzles are interesting and sometimes require you to think outside the box, while still making some sort of sense A purple tentacle is trying to take over the world and you and two friends have to try and defeat him with the help of time travelling toilets, whats not to like ??

76561198012450682,3,N/A,Recommended,"An older MMO,  but if you love LOTR you will love this. There's loads of content, so there's plenty to do. The deeds/achievements give you Lotro points to spend in store so if you are playing on the ftp you can unlock expansions & content by grinding these out, or spend tem on lots of other cool stuff such as mounts, costume pieces, xp/crafting boosts and more! Free daily gift which varies from something small like a few coins up to armour, plus if your vip you get a free weekly gift too which has better odds of being something cool :D Beautiful scenery and music and also has seasonal events, such as halloween, winter etc.","4,241.5 hrs on record																					(1,506.5 hrs at review time)",N/A

76561198012450682,3,N/A,Recommended,"Fun & Addictive This is a really easy and nice casual game to play for all ages, but at the same time addictive as you cant help but keep coming back to it, i guess the lure of earning billions upon billions of Pounds/Dollars is too much to stay away from, even if it is fake money lol Game runs in real time so you don't have to constantly sit at the screen watching the money build up before you can buy another upgrade/business, tune can be a little repetitive after a while but that's the only thing that i find annoying about the game. Also, for those who get truly addicted to this game (like i have) there is also an Adventure Capitalist App!! I have it on ios so i don't know if there's and android version, but again its free, tho like the pc version there is the option for micro transactions, but with a little patience you really don't NEED them to play the game as you can easily enjoy it without them :D",239.1 hrs on record																					(3.6 hrs at review time),N/A
