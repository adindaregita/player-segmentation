76561197976281073,1,N/A,Recommended,I've played through this game half a dozen times and still find it enjoyable.  A bit of a reverse tower defense with mechanics I haven't seen elsewhere.,16.1 hrs on record																					(14.6 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197976281073,1,N/A,Recommended,The best $3 I've spent in a long time.,45.4 hrs on record																					(9.0 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197976281073,1,N/A,Recommended,"A superb turn based strategy game that I've lost too many hours in.  The multiplayer is full of additional games in the style of what once was found in the Battle.net arena, player made mods that allow for whole new games from fairly basic foot (of winged) races to tower defense modes, MOBA like DotA and LoL, zombie horde defense holdout games in competitive and co-operative varieties.  An easy recommendation for any fan of strategy games. Oh, and it's open source, so no corporation can destroy it or take it away!",78.8 hrs on record																					(50.3 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197976281073,1,N/A,Recommended,This game is amazing.  It makes you laugh while engrossing you in the 'one more turn' strategy.  Becoming a Glorious Leader is a solid recommendation for anyone who ever enjoyed a strategy game. I didn't even know I wanted this game.  It's so much more than I thought it would be.  So many other games smoothly combined into one here.,68.7 hrs on record																					(32.6 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197976281073,1,N/A,Recommended,"With more than 20 hours in the demo, this game was one of the two? games I've purchased before it went on sale in the last decade.  I want to say Mechwarrior online was the last that got money before the game came out.  This game is amazing,  Just try the demo and see for yourself!",44.9 hrs on record																					(15.3 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197976281073,1,N/A,Recommended,"I am not a fan of horror games but after just a few matches this won me over handily.  The suspense and chase is amazing, and in the end it's a game where everyone has fun.  Akin to an interactive horror experience where your opponent is not some AI, but actual human beings.  Highly recommended that you play both the survivor and the killer, as you learn so much about how the other works and can enjoy the two differing unique experiences.","4,506.6 hrs on record																					(211.7 hrs at review time)",N/A
76561197976281073,1,N/A,Recommended,"Puzzle solving mayhem.  Some are quick and easy to work out, some I've spent hours on and gotten nowhere.",7.1 hrs on record																					(1.1 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197976281073,1,N/A,Recommended,"My only complaint is that I didn't start playing it sooner. Do you like card games?  Dice games?  Board games? You can smoothly and easily play any game you want at just about any time, assuming you can find someone to play with. Yet there are over 6000 playing this on any weekday afternoon with more than 10k on while I type this. You will *NOT* regret it.","1,210.2 hrs on record																					(278.2 hrs at review time)",N/A
76561197976281073,1,N/A,Recommended,A quick strategic game with ever burgeoning tactics.  An easy to understand and well balanced card game.  I played it on Kongregate for free for a year before deciding to purchase the 'full' product here just because the developers have made a fun engaging game.,16.3 hrs on record																					(3.8 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197976281073,2,N/A,Recommended,"A solid tactical strategy RPG hybrid that makes it easy to imagine yourself once more sitting around the table with minis, and playing through D&D 'adventures'.  The best part is it's free!  (but buy the developers some pizza if you enjoy and can afford it)",17.5 hrs on record																					(10.3 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197976281073,2,N/A,Recommended,Very enjoyable and full of strategy.  An excellent game.,24.1 hrs on record																					(21.2 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197976281073,2,N/A,Recommended,"Played a day, took a couple days off and came back to it.  It had been updated in between.  The update changed everything to Chinese and I can no longer participate in this game.  No communication from developers.",0.6 hrs on record,N/A
76561197976281073,2,N/A,Recommended,"I am the very model of a shadowrunning samurai; I've razorclaws and dermal plates and target-sensing cybereyes. I know the gangs of Redmond and I ride a wizzer motorbike, I'm very well acquainted with a fixer known as Magic Mike. I may not hack the Matrix but I know just how to swing a blade, In such a way to guarantee my target simply won't evade. I understand unwritten rules of mercenary ettiquette... (ettiquette...) Like splitting loot or stealing kills or how Yakuza settle bets! I'm very good at cleaving skulls or stabbing things without a fuss, or taking trophies from awakened critters animalculous... In short you'll find no better suited member for your team than I, For I'm the very model of a shadowrunning samurai! I'll take the toughest missions, always eager to test out my skill, No matter the opponent, I can register another kill. I've made my reputation as a warrior decked out in chrome, I've worked for folks named Johnson breaking in to the Tacoma Dome. I'm stronger than a wendigo, with muscles cultured in a vat, My lungs can filter toxins and I've not an ounce of body fat, I'm swifter than a cheetah thanks to wired reflexology, (reflexology, hmm...) I'll get your decker in and out of Renraku Arcology! Then I can get the nuyen we were promised for the datasteal, I'd celebrate but essence loss has left me unable to feel. Don't bother even trying 'cause I'm never taken by surprise, I am the very model of a shadowrunning samurai! They never see me coming when I work to infiltrate a place, I move so fraggin' swiftly that you'd swear I thought it was a race. But if you see a cyber psycho coming at you like he's nuts, You'll never even realize I've already sliced out your guts. That's not to say that I don't have affinity for gunnery, I've got a smartlink Ingram that I use for long-range funnery, In short it doesn't matter if I'm using swords or pistolry (pistolry... aha!) You'll say my quarry never even stood a chance in history! So take me on your run because I'm plucky and adventury, More talented than anyone you'll hope to meet this century, If anyone says different then they're tellin' you a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lie, 'Cause I'm the very model of a shadowrunning samurai!",5.8 hrs on record,N/A
76561197976281073,2,N/A,Recommended,"Just the first hour in and it's been intriguing enough to keep me going.  It clearly shows how it contains pay to win mechanics for deck building, but I believe the matchmaking will do their best to match up equal power levels which turns it back into a skill/knowledge based game. I'll put in another hour and see how I feel.  So many games call for so much of our time these days...",239.2 hrs on record																					(23.2 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197976281073,2,N/A,Recommended,"Imported my progress from Kongregate.com and found that I've won over 1000 multiplayer battles.  Clearly I enjoyed and stuck around for the game.  A very addicting, quick, strategic, varied, and fun game that has tournaments at the wonderfully low price of free!  Spending $10 will help you advance a bit quicker, but is not needed to experience the full range of the game.",46.1 hrs on record																					(24.6 hrs at review time),N/A

76561197976281073,2,N/A,Recommended,"Liking what I see so far.  There's an active, responsive dev and a wonderful game as is.  This creator has captured an elusive experience I've searched for since Shadowrun first came out, and before.  Definitely a recommendation to all.",31.2 hrs on record																					(19.9 hrs at review time),N/A
