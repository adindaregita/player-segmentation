The decisions you make from the first round make a difference all the way through the game.  It is planning on a small scale but still find myself occasionally having analysis paralysis. Should I build more military or should I build that card with the cool effect instead. It plays well and I have not seen any problems, crashes, or bugs. It is nice to be able to play a full game in under ten minutes. There is no chat in online games so you can play against humans with no worries of being berated on how you play.  The challenges are fun and you can unlock all the content of the game by just playing the game. It is well worth buying.",52.5 hrs on record																					(9.8 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198031295465,1,N/A,Recommended,I purchased this game to play with friends. I have played many games of the board game version of Waterdeep. I can say that this is a very accurate adaptation of the game. It is nice that the AI keeps track of all your resources and plot quest effects. I have only played on-line with friends so I can not offer an opinion on the asychronous play. The graphics are nice and clear and the cards are easy to read since you can zoom into any space or card by just clicking on it. The AI also keeps a running total of your Victory Points so you always know where you are in point standing. I have thoroughly wnjoyed the games I have played and I am sure I will enjoy many more.,53.4 hrs on record																					(10.6 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197985705149,1,N/A,Recommended,"I love old school MMOs and bought the game. Made a summoner and got to 10th level. The game needs a TON of work and is very alpha, which is surprising for how long the game has been under development. Needs at least another 4-6 years of development. I thought I would love this game, but the death penalty sucks super hard and is a deal breaker for me. Not only do you lose experience when you die, you don't get any of it back. AS A BONUS YOU CAN LOSE YOUR LEVEL. That is just punishing for no good reason and really not fun. Especially since this game is a super grind, way beyond EQ. The game is also not very solo friendly. Other issues: Most of the systems they speak about aren't developed yet. Missing races Missing classes All classes are not done, most only have some of the skills and spells up to 20th level. Invisible walls everywhere as there isn't much content. Poor monster scaling. You find low level creatures all over the place but it is very difficult to find your level. Terrible dialog for NPCs. Most have nothing to say or say the same statement over and over. Weird zone glitches  in areas that you don't need to zone. Swimming is very clunky. Terrible economy, enjoy being poor and having terrible equipment until you get you reach higher levels. You look like you are dressed in rags. My pet looked better than me. Poor power scaling, you don't feel more powerful as you level, you just feel weaker as the monsters get more and more powerful than you. So forget the feeling of being a hero. If you don't like grouping this isn't the game for you. Dull foggy coloring for the whole game. Cartoonish look and feel. Toxic community. There is more issues, but I will leave that up to you to discover for yourself.",36.8 hrs on record																					(36.7 hrs at review time),N/A

76561197985705149,1,N/A,Recommended,"After playing for quite some time, I feel really frustrated by the stupid equipment drops. Most of it is junk, the stores sell junk and improving equipment with all kinds of stupid little weird faces makes no sense at all. I feel like I just make terrible choices which is making me hate the game. The small little tutorial info is pretty useless and now I have to watch a bunch of youtube videos and read sites on the game just to understand how to play decently. This just sucks. I wish the developers had put a bit more time into helping lower level casual players get an understanding of the game as it is totally different than POE 1. I didn't have this bad of a time with POE1. POE2 needs a bunch of work, even figuring out how to slot stuff with a joystick is a nightmare. Diablo 4 was easier to play, way more fun, better loot drops and easier to figure out. The boss fights are a nightmare as well, many classes I couldn't get past the end boss in chapter 1, and because there was nothing else to do but grind mobs, you end up leveling and the mobs are worth less experience. I tried 4 classes and the only one I could get past the chapter 1 boss was the Mercenary. I think I will come back in 6 months and see if they have improved the game.",28.2 hrs on record,N/A

76561197985705149,1,N/A,Recommended,Great graphics. Annoying interface. Difficult to figure out the puzzles. Blocks you from moving forward unless you get the puzzles right. Very liner. I played 5 minutes and have given up as it is so frustrating.,0.2 hrs on record,N/A

76561197985705149,1,N/A,Recommended,"Starts off fun and then gets really not fun. Problems: Monsters aren't scaled well and you get trashed in the 2nd area. The monsters also move too fast. Because of monster speed bow is useless. Vast wilderness  that is boring and constantly attack. WAY too far to travel the distances. Crafting is a grind, for example you have to run for a long time between crafting stations. Resources are rare. Combat is just constant rolling around like an idiot. Some quests need more work. For example the lovers quest is a kinda of a let down as you save the werewolf dude and restore their love, but they say nothing to you when you come back to town. Mountain areas are super annoying, got stuck in the area early one and all the monsters are super hard, All the quests in town are super hard. Should be able to use heal potions in battle, just makes it too hard otherwise. Need the ability to zoom out farther. Need the ability to add markers to map.",3.8 hrs on record,N/A
76561197985705149,1,N/A,Recommended,"Suggestions: 1. The music is too repetitive. Needs to change up more. 2. Too easy to get lost because all the walls look the same. Need more wall designs. 3. Remove stamina, that is just no fun. 4. The map is huge and I was just lost and gave up before I even found level 2. This is why you need more wall designs. Needs something that informs where the exit is or something that informs the user what direction to go. Since it is hell you could have a temperature bar that shows that it is getting hotter. 5. I couldn't figure out how to use magic, need to inform user on how to do that.",0.3 hrs on record,N/A
76561197985705149,1,N/A,Recommended,"Found the game frustrating. Issues: 1. Very simple game with the appearance of choice, when there really isn't any. 2. Can't skip long drawn out story conversations which makes it so you wouldn't want to replay the game. 3. No ability to save so you are forced to live with the meaningless choices. 4. Pointless clues. For example you have a scanner and all you have to do is visit every site. 5. You start with one character who lives or dies and then you are playing another character, which didn't make me feel invested in the characters. The characters seems hollow. Maybe the game gets better later on but I got bored after hours of sitting through this story that was so slooooow and shallow.",5.3 hrs on record,N/A
76561197985705149,1,N/A,Recommended,"The new developer has really turned this game around. The graphics and gameplay have been improved. Everything has been revamped and it is quite a lot of fun now. All the old problems have been fixed. OLD REVIEW Disappointing There are some great game play mechanics, but this game is not ready for release. Somehow the developers fooled themselves into thinking the community of gamers would think their lack of polish would be ok. Here is a small list of problems: 1. Of course tons of bugs due a lack of testing and not enough developers. 2. Has a subscription and you can completed all content in 1 day. The game needs at least 10 maps the same size as the current one totally fleshed out. 3. Classes are not balanced or finished. You also can’t get to the next city where you would progress your class. Many class skills are unfinished, useless or not scaled right. 4. Level scaling is a grind to try and keep you from completing all content in a day.  This kicks in at 6th level. 5. Broken quests, unfinished quests, quests that make no sense. No quest reset. 6. Confusing UI and gameplay. For example there is no clear instructions that you can hit enter and tell the fisherman where you want to travel. 7. Broken and messy UI, Text overlapping, unable to click on elements, etc. 8. Monster scaling is broken. For example the last boss a stone golem is super easy to kill solo while bandits in the old mine will kill you in 3 or 4 blows. 9. The end quest says the game is in Alpha, but the game is being sold as if it is a complete and finished game. 10. There are only a couple recipes to be found. This is super grindy. 11. Many of the skills are useless and then there are actions that should be skills that aren’t, such as climbing. 12. Main storyline starts very interesting but ends poorly, like someone never finished it. 13. Lot of unfinished systems such as the Journal, PVP, most skills. Get rid of PVP and maybe some of the other features to actually be able to finish this game. 14. Lag, lag, lag. 15. Rubber banding where  you run and then spring back to previous location. This game needs another 2-3 years of development.",20.1 hrs on record																					(19.8 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197985705149,2,N/A,Recommended,"Terrible. Worst customization options that make it very difficult to get the right screen size settings if you have a large monitor. The story is meaningless and provides no reason as to why you  are killing things. The beginning is so confusing with no direction of what you are  supposed to do. The world is weird and empty, but I imagine that is because I just found the horse and rode around. Glad I didn't have to pay for this game.",0.4 hrs on record,N/A

76561197985705149,2,N/A,Recommended,The game has been released too early. The developer needs to bug test the first hours of gameplay more.  When stuff doesn't work the player can't get invested enough to help. For $25 the game should be in a working state. The dice rolls are brutal to the point it isn't fun at all to play. The combat is just frustrating and confusing. There is a lack of notifying the user about what is happening like most areas of the game. Example is explore can be red and you can click on it but it doesn't tell you that you are tired and have no stamina.  Getting damage that can't be healed sucks. Having 140% crime rating and walking through the gate of the city the next time is just silly. Why do I have to pay 5 gold everytime I go through the gate of my home town? WASD doesn't work in dungeons. Spell icons are wrong. Lot of game mechanics that aren't fully designed and thus make no sense. I think this game has potential but a lot more testing is needed and the game should be priced around $10 if you want us to bug test.,1.8 hrs on record,N/A
76561197985705149,2,N/A,Recommended,Fun game but very difficult to get across the country. Wish you could keep some items from the last round. Wish you could have a least 2 characters to start. The story is really lacking. Would be nice if there was more to do in town or on the road. With the leveling being so hard I think people will lose interest after not being able to make a run across the country and have  died 50 times.

76561197985705149,2,N/A,Recommended,"Wanted to love this game but the first Boss battle sucks and basically if you can't get past it, then you can't enjoy the rest of the game, this should be an easy kill. I used a trainer to beat it so I could see the rest of the world. Once I got on the boat it was really annoying because I fell through the sand and my boat couldn't move anymore. So once again stuck.

76561197985705149,2,N/A,Recommended,"I played this game 79 hours. The game is very fun for the first 15 levels and then it gets SUPER grindy, the main quest seems to die out and you just have fetch or kill  quests.  Everything is locked behind skills which are hard to level . You will spends days fighting and harvesting in a swamp to gain +1 level so you can enter another swamp.  If you could just wear equipment with the right level it would be great but they lock how much skill boost you can get from equipment. This doesn't affect you in the beginning but the skill boost lock makes it so frustrating later on. PROS: Cool Map and fun to see other players moving about. Fun main quest. Fun combat system. Interesting mechanics with skills, harvest and crafting. Other players are super friendly and helpful CONS: Mechanics with skills, harvest and crafting - get grindy by level 15 Super hard to play without spending around $50 Hard even when you do spend money. Lack the feeling of adventure after level 15 and you feel like you spend all your time harvesting.

Currently the game suggests all the amazing things you can do as a ruler, but in reality they prevent you from being a woman big time. The game is very weird. When I finally tracked down a woman ruler to play she just magically keeps pumping out babies every year. Seems like these guys don't understand anything about child birth and ruling a nation. I hate combat so much. I just spend my time chasing people all over the map. The systems are so convoluted and complicated under the surface that you will feel lost the minute the tutorial is over. Much of what you need to do is hidden from sight that you are bound to miss something important that you need to do and end up making poor choices that make the game frustrating.",2.4 hrs on record,N/A

There are too many options. The red lines make you think you can't use that section when it is really a info that is meaningless. Buttons are grayed out without explaining why.

Sometimes I was disoriented by how fast I would spin around, 3. More freedom when targeting a creature. Sometimes I was stuck moving really weird because I was locked on a target path. 4.

76561197985705149,4,N/A,Recommended,"The game has gone from decent to worse. Now you have to start out the first round with no hero and now you don't have to skill them up.  The game is mostly luck in the beginning and luck later with a little skill with combinations. Thus the whole thing turns into a pointless grind. The inability to choose your choice of starting character causes people to drop and just join another game.  I find myself stuck with characters I don't want to play and forced to develop strategies for random combinations that often don't work very well. If the characters you want don't appear either for leveling a character or providing you the character you want, you often end up wasting gold and crippling yourself.

There is no way to trade them. So basically all you can do is buy packs. The game is such a grind and overly complicated. The endless clicking back and forth between players, an aspect I always hated with Magic the Gathering.  Why even bring up the shop if I can't buy anything??? Now I have click again. Why make me click the button if I can't play anything in the lane??? One of the big turn offs for me is the inability to move your heros to a postion. Then the whole not being able to do anything on a lane when you don't have a hero. Players just get soooo overpowered when you can't play anything in that lane.

This game is amazing!  What makes it amazing is that you have the feel of the old games but with more modern aspects and fantastic graphics. I find the game as cheeky and funny as the originals. The character creation is good and the development of your character is rewarding. I am enjoying the story. The puzzles are the perfect toughness, that I have only been stopped for maybe five minutes before I figured them out. Combat is exciting and challenging but not too tough. I have only died one or two times. There are many cool stategies, like levitating a monster to your fighter and having him bash the hell out of him. I love that spell casting doesn't take action points. You can also get monsters to accidently kill off other monsters at times. The biggest challenge is actually getting money. I have found lots of cool weapons but not much in the way of money. I hope that changes. I love the loading screen where the bard sings about where you in your adventure. Great soundtrack and sound effects. The few issues I have had is slow loading times and one bug where I was stuck on the map and had to reload the game.

The woman who plays the main character isn't actually looking at anything.  So she just looks spaced out. Combat is a total pain. Discovering the runes to doors is fun at first but then is a horrible chore. The main story just sucks, but the minor stories which are BIG myths are great. The developers are so ego filled with their graphics that you spend way too much of the game looking at this woman's face.

They wasted time on PVP and crafting, instead of focusing on gameplay and storyline. Thus the game is pointless and boring and looks terrrible. I loved the Ultima series, but this game tells you that it wasn't Lord British/Richard Garriot who made these games great. There are silly quests that direct you to zones where you will be destroyed upon adventuring into. You will have to love grind grind grind as you stand with attacking dummies to raise skills, just so you can survive fighting in different Teirs that make no sense. You have no idea if you can handle a certain teir. You will have no idea what you are doing with anything, because the entire UI sucks and never helps you figure out anything without going and Googling. You aren't a hero right out of the gate. You are stupid scavenager trying to get as much gold from looting bodies, it is so lame. There is no story. The conversation with NPCs just sucks and is a click fest.

76561197985705149,5,N/A,Recommended,"I was a backer of this project and from the beginning the game was fantastic. The demos were games in themselves. But the finished version has destroyed all the fun, makes no sense and might as was just be a video instead of a game. The storyline is a huge problem. The main character is just stupid and his story makes you encounter moral issues, all the while being forced do immoral acts that you have no choice but to participate in. This makes me hate playing the game because I don’t like playing characters I hate and being manipulated into thinking I have choice, but the reality is that there is no choice. Then there are the horrible gameplay features: Saving the game requires getting drunk. Who remembers much of anything when they are drunk?? Not to mention I want to save the game, but now I am stumbling around and can’t play because the screen is blurred. Who thought this was a good idea? Lock picking is so hard that you end failing 90% of the time. They make the lock picks super expensive and the majority of locks are hard or very hard in the beginning areas. You have to be a master of the mouse. Zero fun here. Horse back riding on the PC requires you to have 3 hands.  W held down while you try to double tap the left shift key, while hitting S and D while moving the mouse with your right hand. This tells the story of how they ended up leaving the PC behind, while they focused on console. If there is one thing that screws up games, it is making the game console compatible. I had to get my daughter to help me play the game by having her hold down the W key so I could actually escape with the horse. Pickpocketing is another skill like lock picking where you are going to suck and get caught like 80% of the time. You will also accidently hit the pickpocketing key and have all the guards go after you on a regular basis. Sometimes the guards will just randomly hunt you down for some unknown crime. Once you commit a crime you are screwed because it takes forever for it wear off. Same with wounds. I fell accidently from a ladder and had to bandage myself and the wounds take forever to heal. So you might think “Oh I will just sleep and move time ahead.” You can forget that because apparently following the liner storyline quests are more important than gameplay and you will be forced out of moving time forward. You get hungry all the time, who eats 10 times a day and if you eat too much you are considered a pig and have a penalty that slows you down. Don’t eat food that isn’t in perfect condition otherwise you are going to get 100% poisoned. Skills are poorly thought out. You have a notification that you have skills to spend, but all the main skills have annoying negatives that go with them. Like annoying notifications on your phone, the skill notification is going to bug you until you choose one. The skills now seem to have no real noticeable affect on gameplay, which means you have to gain a lot of skill to actually be any good at anything. Haggling is strange now and just annoying that it doesn’t seem to be worth doing. People everywhere that don’t have any interaction. When you interact with anyone who isn’t a main character, the dialog is pointless and boring. Even main characters is just click and listen with choices that are meaningless. The demos were way better when it came to dialog. The demos were all about exploring and discovering the wonders of the world. Well now there doesn’t appear to be much to find. Everything is quest centric, so going off the beaten path is meaningless. All choices are the almost the same outcome to keep the story on track. The gameplay is so frustrating that you will want to cheat with a trainer or quit the game. Everything in the game is full of penalties as some way to make you think the game is sooo realalistic, but actually just drains all the fun out of the game.",7.0 hrs on record,N/A

76561197985705149,5,N/A,Recommended,Amazing game! An impressive unique gameplay and reminds me of the old days on my Commodore 64. I couldn't stop playing the game until I reached the areas that are not done yet.  Can't wait until new content comes out. A few minor bugs and wishing I had a place to store special items or lock items so I don't accidently sell them.,8.7 hrs on record																					(7.1 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197985705149,5,N/A,Recommended,"This game totally sucks. The game is linear and you can't interact with anything but what the developer has assigned. You are given no back history or story and no understanding of the controls. There is no voice over and the scenes are abrupt and thus make no sense. Weird things like pick flowers for no reason in a field. There are also long pauses between trying to tell a story. Weird scenes where you see your own body. After about 30 minutes after being dragged through weird mental head trip, I quit.",0.7 hrs on record,N/A
76561197985705149,5,N/A,Recommended,"I paid for the collectors edition and this game is total crap. People can block doorways, you die constantly. The story is totally lame. Unless you are an expert at FPS you will need to group with other players to get through missions. The game just sucks on so many levels.",3.2 hrs on record																					(3.1 hrs at review time),N/A

76561197985705149,5,N/A,Recommended,"This is just a horrible remake of CIV. There are so many problems with this game. Here is the list: 1. Horrible confusing UI 2. Confusing tech tree that is difficult to figure out what to research to get what you want. Meaningless tech names. 3. Terrible AI, you can sit there bombing a city and the opponent sends nothing against you. 4. Repetitive conversations from the other AI players, had to turn off the sounds. 5.  Difficult to manage troops on the map due to overlapping graphics and troops being blocked by other troops you have. 6. Millions of pointless aliens. You never meet another alien race or visit other planets. You just fight humans, so you might as well play the previous CIV because at least you get historical achievements. 7. The game just feels like it was made by lazy uncreative people. ""Lets make a space CIV by creating some new graphics and overlaying it on top of the last CIV game and rip out all the stuff we don't need. Then we can make some quick money.""",9.9 hrs on record																					(9.8 hrs at review time),N/A
