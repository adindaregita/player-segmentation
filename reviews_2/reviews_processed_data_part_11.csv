76561197992783558,1,Card Survival: Tropical Island,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"While this looks like a card game, that's just how the UI is designed. There's no shuffling, deckbuilding, drawing cards, etc. It's actually just a tightly designed survival game with a unique presentation method. The game is challenging especially when you're learning what techs to rush to mitigate the sometimes brutal RNG, but I really like the progression of techs and capabilities as you gradually build up to being able to fully explore and exploit the island.",160.5 hrs on record																					(79.5 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197992783558,1,The Black Pool,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG",Recommended,"I wanted so badly to love this game. An action roguelike with wacky abilities, unique enemies, and a slightly weird setting - it's everything that I want in a game. Unfortunately it's marred by extremely bad balancing and poor design choices. Many abilities are just terrible or completely impractical to use, a few regular enemies are harder than the level bosses (i.e. colossus), certain maps make it hard to see or easy to get stuck, and so on. I'm really sad to give this a thumbs down, but most runs ended up being infuriating in unfun ways.",10.9 hrs on record,N/A
76561197992783558,1,Backpack Hero,"Adventure, Casual, Indie, RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"This game is all about inventory management and I love it.

76561197992783558,1,ScourgeBringer,"Action, Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"Fun responsive combat and good enemy variety. Unfortunately in-run upgrades do nothing to change combat, offering zero run variety. Either you love the combat so much you don't mind, or you'll get bored fast. A very cautious thumbs up on this one.",2.8 hrs on record,N/A
76561197992783558,1,Nightmare Reaper,"Action, Indie",Recommended,"A fun boomer shooter whose best feature (randomized guns) is held back because you only get to keep one. Enemy variety is good, map design is solid, weapon variety is great, passive buff unlocks are fine (you can skip the minigames via a menu option if you hate them), and the random modifiers on the weapons can vastly change how they work. The problem is you only get to keep one gun after each level for a huge amount of the game. At 35 hours I still hadn't unlocked a second gun storage slot. That means you can't experiment with the guns very much - if you find a great gun, you have to keep it. And that's what ended up pushing me away from the game. With my one amazing gun gameplay started to feel stale, but I couldn't afford to keep something else in the hopes of upgrading it to what I needed. I made that mistake once and it took a long time to find something decent enough to start progressing again. I think with a more forgiving loot system (keep more guns sooner, more frequent reroll options, etc.) this could have been an incredible game instead of just a good one.",35.2 hrs on record,N/A
76561197992783558,1,Astro Colony,"Action, Adventure, Casual, Indie, Simulation, Strategy, Early Access",Recommended,"This game offers lots of freedom in terms of what you can build and where you can go. Unfortunately there's nothing interesting to explore or experience, and the game systems are all dull at best and frustrating at worst. Resource islands are too bland and small to explore in any meaningful way. Crew are uninteresting automatons. The building UI is frustrating layered menus, made worse because there's no way to move objects - you have to deconstruct then find it in the build menus and rebuild it again. The build tools are frustrating too, everything feels like it takes more steps to place than it should. This game has a decent foundation but it needs to give the player something fun or interesting to do. For now it's not worth a buy. ================== Update: I'd like to thank the developer for their thougtful reply and respond to some of their comments. Original review play time was 4.2 hours. Time beyond that was spent checking things for this response. - I wish you could spend more time in the game [...] I look for the start of a game to be fun and interesting in its own way, not something I have to push through to get to the fun stuff. Also if I'm not having fun with a game after 2-4 hours, I'd rather play something else instead of forcing myself to continue. - [...] you missed many QOL [...] Middle click is only helpful if the new placement doesn't overlap the old placement. Blueprints are only helpful if several items need to be moved as a group. In the hotbars, buildings' functions are not visually obvious. Hovering over each hotbar button to see a building's name is just as frustrating as using the build menu's search box when having to do either repeatedly. When you need to move several buildings to unique overlapping destinations, having to delete them then find them to rebuild them is frustrating when a ""move object"" option would streamline things greatly. Here is a specific example: Rearranging my very limited initial layout to allow space for conveyors took about half an hour due to the clunky tools for deleting and placing buildings and conveyors. I was not looking forward to repeating this process numerous times as new tech unlocked, especially with even more placed buildings and logistics to relocate. - I am always finding each playthrough exciting. I did note that the game offers lots of freedom in building and movement. I think those are its strong points. But after 4 hours of gameplay my frustrations with the building process and disappointment with the crew and planets made me feel like the game was not giving me anything I was excited to do. I did try to detail my thoughts in my initial review so readers can decide whether their interests/frustrations align with mine. As always it's difficult to give a negative review to a game that a developer cares about and has worked hard on, but the bottom line is based on my experiences I would not recommend the game to others.",6.2 hrs on record,N/A
76561197992783558,1,Wizard with a Gun,"Action, Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"Super fun core gameplay loop wrapped in mildly annoying grind. Recommended if you're interested, just make sure the annoyances aren't dealbreakers for you. Pros: + Shooting stuff feels good, fun variety of guns, bullets, and modifiers. + Good variety of enemies + Overall going out into the world and fighting feels very satisfying Cons: - Need lots of mats to craft and research, but inventory/storage is frustrating to interact with - Each area gets progressively more annoying to walk around in, including making you walk slower - You get gears in groups of 2-3. You need ~15 to unlock the next boss. Miss a gear and you have to do a run just to finish that gear group. Makes for needless grind + repetition. - Mods you unlock are super expensive to apply to guns so you can't really enjoy trying out different combos unless you want to grind out a ton of mats. - Some guns/bullets felt way more powerful than others, and enemy threat/challenge was all over the board too. I would have liked the game better if it took 8-10 hours to finish instead of 15+. It was very fun using wacky guns and bullets to fight things, but inevitably I'd get to a point where I felt like I'd seen everything in an area and I'd still have at least 2-4 runs left to clear it. Also I have no idea why they made mods so expensive to apply, it would have been super fun to be able to try stuff out but I felt trapped into sticking with what worked since I didn't want to add even more grind to the game. Overall a fun game that could have been better.",17.4 hrs on record,N/A
76561197992783558,1,Stranded: Alien Dawn,"Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"A very good small-scale medium complexity base builder with some balance and pacing issues. Positive: + I really liked the feel of a small group of survivors struggling to make it with no support on an alien planet. + Different game modes and biomes provided reasons to replay a couple of times. + Progression via tech and expeditions and building was satisfying. + Good building system + Survivors have unique qualities, making them feel more like people + Steam workshop provides fixes and new content, including support from one of the devs Neutral: - Punishing if you don't know exactly what techs/plants/etc to rush. (Kind of standard for this type of game.) - Low variety of enemy attacks focused on large numbers of enemies. - Large map with no good way to traverse it. - Eventually repetitive. Replay value is not infinite. Mods improve this a bit. Negative: - Poorly balanced. Certain tech/resources/survivors are vastly inferior to others. - Poor documentation. Too hard to know what benefits certain techs provide (compounds tech balance problem) - In Crash Landing and Military scenarios, unlocking the victory condition is fun but finishing it requires an impenetrable base and way too much waiting. - Terrible lightning strike mechanic. If one of your colonists gets hit by lightning, save scum out of it. The debuff is permanent and punishing beyond reason. Overall I had a great time with this one. If you like this type of game and don't need/want something as complex or expansive as Rimworld, this is a great option. Also if you like the base game, mods can add improvements and bonus content - I'll go into more detail below. ===================================== Mods A dev has worked with the community to make a mod pack that allows significant changes to the game. It also includes fixes/improvements to the base game without changing how it plays. Discussion thread here In the workshop SAD_CommonLib Some mods add basic features to the game, the only one I found almost mandatory was the improved camera options. Examples: Camera Options / Unit Log / Circuits Overlay / Lock Doors / No Murder Lightning / Social Control Other mods make major changes, including adding brand new scenarios and game systems: Insects Level Up All Species - enemy attacks grow in strength and abilities instead of rapidly increasing in numbers, a major change from the base game that I found really fun Project X (Repaired) - a major extension of the game's existing systems. If you liked the base game and want more (similar) stuff to research and use, then this is a great option. Minor new mechanics for research and crafting. It uses the ILUAS mod described above for its enemy attacks. Beyond Stranded - If you like the base game without changes and want some improvements to storage and weaponry and events, then this is a great mod. But it doesn't really add anything new like the two other mods described above.",263.7 hrs on record																					(263.2 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197992783558,1,Spellcaster University,"Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"Very good game school builder held back by a few flaws. Building your university feels fun, the animations are nice, and there's tons of choices to be made. There is a lot of randomness in room selection, but without that you could just pick and choose your exact strategy every time and it would quickly become formulaic and dull. I would love this game if not for two major issues: 1) You can't see your school when picking upgrades. You get to pick from 3 upgrades. They often require specific rooms to be in your school. Since you can't see the school when picking, you have to remember what you have which can be frustrating especially when returning to a save after a break. 2) Not enough info on students' behavior. It's too hard to see if rooms are being underutilized, and if so why. The game also does a poor job of communicating when students are leaving so you know there's a problem. Overall I still had a great time with this game and I recommend it if you're interested.",61.8 hrs on record,N/A
76561197992783558,1,Dust & Neon,"Action, Adventure, RPG",Recommended,"Decent gameplay but zero mission variety makes this grindy roguelite unfun. Every gun feels the same, no in-mission upgrades/etc., massive mission failure penalty, meta progression is just buffs that add no new mechanics and take forever to unlock. Once you've seen every level type (4? 5?) you've seen the entire game. Not worth playing.",6.2 hrs on record,N/A
76561197992783558,2,Timemelters,"Action, Indie, Strategy",Recommended,"I really loved this game. The core gameplay is amazing and the campaign is a ton of fun. It's also a game that's hard to describe/define. There's elements of strategy, third person combat, tower defense, and of course time loops. The campaign is well designed, doing an great job of introducing tricky mechanics without being overwhelming while letting the player experiment with the various abilities. The co-op campaign (~7 hours to beat) is almost the same as solo, with balancing and tweaks that make it fun for two players. There's a free friend pass that will let a friend play the co-op campaign with you. There's also a ton of ""challenges"", one-off missions with no story. Generally they're less flexible and forgiving, and more like combat puzzles with one solution. If you don't like that sort of thing they're skippable and imo the campaign has enough content to make the game worthwhile. Highly recommended if you like unique games and you think you might enjoy its mashup of genres.",11.8 hrs on record,N/A

The world map is a nice layer that keeps things interesting in the mid + late game. Story is simple and minimal but it gives the player a reason to press forward and I personally enjoyed it.

76561197992783558,2,SurrounDead,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Early Access",Recommended,"Game has great core gameplay but needs more time in the oven. Serious bugs and bad game mechanics make it very frustrating. About a quarter of my play time is lost progress due to bugs or poor game mechanics. - Every normal location feels the same. Farming money and gear feels like a tedious grind. - I didn't find anything to do aside from grinding out more bullets to take on harder areas. - Intel markers are incredibly rare/expensive and vanish if you reload. This compounds the above problems. - The game start is terrible. If you don't find a can opener and backpack and water right away you might as well restart. - Car gets stuck too easy and the ""unstuck"" button frequently fails. Wildlife will randomly block your car. - On game load you don't wield a weapon resulting in aggravating deaths every time I forget about it. - The inventory system is bad. Too much time fooling around with containers (even if you don't nest backpacks). This is currently being reworked though and I have hope it will be improved soon. The bottom line is if I could go back I'd tell myself to not get this game right now but keep my eye on it because it has a lot of potential. And that's what I'm telling you.",22.8 hrs on record,N/A

It does everything well, but also in a very simplistic manner that some players will find boring or off-putting. This also means there is virtually no replay value.

76561197992783558,2,EON Trooper,"Action, Adventure, Casual, Indie",Recommended,"Decent twin stick shooter with Survivors-like passive tree and in-game upgrade system. Unfortunately it lacks the scale of combat, build options, and impressive elite/boss enemies which can make other Survivors-like games feel more impactful. Pros: + Objectives to complete, with the end goal of extraction + Upgrades are squad members with special weapons + Special Attack that charges up as you get kills (or do damage?) + Good upgrade and character variety + Rebindable keys Neutral: = One gun all run = Passive unlocks are simple/linear = Decent enemy variety Cons: - Hero/boss enemies unimpressive - Lack of objective variety - Upgrades don't combine to make combos, limiting build variety - Only 15 upgrades (4 types) per run, with the 15th just before the end, limiting build scale - A couple of minor bugs (Special Attack doesn't work when key rebound, extended mags don't work if picked up when reloading) I did have fun playing it but I don't think it's for everyone.

76561197992783558,3,Unexplored,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG",Recommended,"A tightly designed roguelite that only some people will love. Weapons and enemies are tightly balanced, early success/difficulty depends heavily on learning the game mechanics rather than luck, and the game rewards exploring. But there's near zero variety in abilities and weapons in every run, and it's very ""low fantasy"" meaning super powers / magic are very limited. If you want a super dry, tightly designed and mechanically rewarding roguelite this is a superb game. If you want something with fast (or even medium) paced combat where you can play around with character builds and experience diverse ability and gear combos, this game is not for you at all. It's tough giving this a thumbs down but the game is so limited in run variety that I think only a small subset of roguelite fans will enjoy this game. Thus I really can't recommend this game.",6.6 hrs on record,N/A

76561197992783558,3,InfraSpace,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"A decent production line game. Some minor flaws and tedium keep it from being really fun. It doesn't feel like a proper city sim because workers and building materials just teleport to workplaces. The traffic and train systems were nice, the distribution depots were a good concept but clunky implementation, the lack of information on building exits when placing buildings was infuriating. It also got tedious in the late late game. There was too much sit-and-wait for the ship repairs and I didn't feel like rearranging my entire city a third time to fulfill the massive production needs for very unimpressive terraforming. An okay production line game, don't get it if you want a serious city sim or if you haven't played the genre greats like Factorio or Factory Town.",35.0 hrs on record,N/A

76561197992783558,3,Cliff Empire,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"Great concept, fun world, solid base builder at first but turns into an incredibly dull grind. For about the first 15 hours this game was super fun. Building up cities on limited land made decisions for building choice, placement, and research very impactful. The game moved along quickly with constant new challenges and progression. After that the game shifted into mega-project mode. My cities were stable so it came down to watching TV or browsing websites while waiting for the resources to trickle in for the various mega-projects. There was no more challenge, no way to speed up progress, and new things to do came along rarely. Overall it's an OK game but if the game's pace had been the same from start to finish I would have called it a great game. Only get this one if you really like the aesthetic or maybe if you want something to play while binge-ing some shows.

I didn't like how overboard PayDay2 went with a billion unlockables and equipment types, but this game only has guns and minor passives which means there's absolutely no variation in what you bring and do on every mission. I played through the ""Urban Legends"" co-op and initially had a good time but by the time it was done it felt like a chore to finish. The single player mode has cool progression but unfortunately the stale gameplay and maps make it not really worth finishing either. I really wanted this game to be a return to Payday's roots with kick-ass guns-blazing missions without all the convoluted nonsense (Heat Street is still one of my favorite gaming experiences), but this is a little too simple with not quite enough variety.

There's just a handful of levels and it's not hard to figure out a solid tower + loadout strategy that doesn't vary much between maps. It's a bummer that such a rock solid TD/FPS game lives in such a limited world. Great for about 6-10 hours (til the end of the campaign), then not really worth playing further.

You fend off waves using a central tower that can have up to 6 total weapons or minion spawners. Every chunk of enemies you kill, you get to pick an upgrade for your tower. Outside of that you sit and watch your tower shoot. You can get a few active skills but most are better off on autocast than manual control. Successful runs take a little over an hour. The upgrades and enemies are fun, and the different characters' perks keeps things feeling sorta fresh, but at about 10 hours it's starting to feel too repetitive even though I do enjoy the core game loop.

The concept of taking over enemies is great, but in practice as a naked blob you are so incredibly weak that it's almost never worth the risk to leave a body to try to grab a new one without getting killed. The ""how it's meant to be played"" mode is particularly infuriating because when you enter a new area you have no bodies unlocked so you can't even take over anyone, and as your unlocks progress it is not clear which bodies you can take over which makes it even more frustrating.

It only feels fair to give a thumbs up but think long and hard before buying. I spent over 60% of my playtime just mindlessly drilling and vacuuming. Dozens of hours. I never would have finished this game without shows/movies going at the same time. I enjoyed building up my farm and unlocking new crops, animals, and buildings. Clearing trash did have a zen like quality to it, it's just that there was way too much of it and very little of it felt optional. Quests were decent enough to give me some sort of goal. Unfortunately turning in the quests was awful. The map lacks markers for where important NPCs are and nothing shows which way the player is facing, making navigating the world needlessly difficult. Additionally quest objectives frequently do not have a directional arrow in the quest tracker. And now for a long list of bugs, none game-breaking but there's so many they really add up: - Transferring items out of storage is broken unless you first mouse over your inventory on the bottom half of the screen. - Animals stack up on top of eachother and targeting is buggy making them incredibly difficult to tend manually. - Animal gathering automation frequently bugs out and stops while mostly empty, leaving animals untended. - Key items can drop through the ground if picked up while your inventory is full. - There are areas you can walk out of bounds or fall through the world. - Some animals can bring you currency which gets stuck in your inventory with no way to get it properly in the currency storage.

The art style is fun, the different regions feel unique, and the crafting is satisfying. There's a tiny bit of combat, mostly avoid the obvious enemy attack, and no real penalty for dying. There's a bit of back tracking required to gather ingredients but with everything labeled by zone and lots of map markers for quests it isn't painful. If this is your type of game, then 100% recommended. ==================== Minor gameplay notes (no spoilers) 1) If you find yourself unable to interact with or harvest anything, exit the game completely and start it again.

The levels themes and bosses are the same every time, and layout barely varies. Towers hardly matter due to low health and random enemy spawn positions, they're good for one round and after that it's pure luck if they do anything at all. The variance in unit upgrades are extremely minor. You can only upgrade 1 unit per level with only 1 option for each unit. You are oppressively punished for taking any unit taking any damage at all because instead of an actual upgrade you'll be offered healing. Pregame options unlock extremely slowly and are often barely different or notably worse than the base loadout. It was ok for the first 2-3 games.

76561197992783558,4,Erannorth Chronicles,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"A fantastic deckbuilder and RPG character builder with the absolute bare minimum of graphics and story. The graphics are not detrimental but they do just enough to convey the presence of units and the fact that actions are happening. The story is provided via meager text snippets but mostly it just feels like you're chasing around level-appropriate missions while occasionally unlocking more missions, all without anything driving you forwards. That being said, the deckbuilding and RPG character building are fantastic. There's a huge variety of options, great ways to combine classes while creating your character, and many options in gear, stats, and perks to build your character as you level. If you're comfortable with RPG mechanics I recommend trying to create your own character instead of using the prefabs, I found the game immensely more fun when I did so. The in game documentation is also the utmost gold standard that most games can only dream of. Alt-clicking any card brings up a sheet describing every single mechanic and effect, and all of those are all clickable to open the in-game documentation for further info! And you can hit F1 to pull up the full documentation at any time AND it's searchable. The whole package really is superb. It's also kind of necessary because the game has a ton of mechanics. They're generally not overly complex but it is extremely overwhelming as a new player, and even many hours in you'll still encounter unfamiliar terms where the help system is a godsend. Usually I'm the type of person who is all about RPG systems especially ones that let me tinker with builds, but I found the world in this game to be just a little too bare. It felt like I was just fighting things with no reason. Even though there is a final mission that lets you win the game, the progress just felt too mechanical. Still I did greatly enjoy my time playing the game and even in only a few playthroughs I encountered a ton of content, I'm just disappointed I couldn't find reason to keep playing further. If you love deckbuilders and playing around with RPG character building, this game is amazing. If you need anything beyond the most bare-bones graphics or story, this game feels empty. Very strongly recommended as long as you consider carefully whether you think you'll enjoy it.",58.1 hrs on record,N/A

The graphics are on the bad side of generic and in 4 hours I found 3 enemy types and 1 boss. All of this could be slightly forgivable if the game was actually fun, but it's not. Combat is a slog, every mob take tons of hits to kill and you cannot absorb more than 2-4 hits without dying, so you're stuck in minutes-long high-pressure fights against the most unrewarding uninteresting opponents. The only decent part of the game is the skill system but even that is unenjoyable. After the first 4, skill points come in at an abysmal trickle and as far as I could tell there is no way to multiclass so once you pick a weapon you're basically stuck with it.

No combat but still challenging via nice systems of needs and growth. The ""idea"" system of unlocking new tech is very nice - it's based on what you have farmed/built so there's no forced XP or Tech Point grind, and you can clearly see what unlocks new stuff. I also liked the family growth method, although the game did not do a good job explaining how it's done. You have to have a non-married adult, recruit a paid laborer of the opposite sex, get their satisfaction to max, then marry the two. Same goes for the unexplained way to get animals into enclosures. They normally can't go through people-only doors, but if you click an animal and tell them to manually move using the square button in the bottom right, they will walk through doors to obey that command. This is important since wolves will eat your livestock with no notification that I saw. You can feel some of the early access rough edges but outside of issues of that sort the game is very fun and rewarding.

76561197992783558,5,Rise to Ruins,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"I can't really recommend this game. Even on Traditional (the ""more relaxed"" aka easiest mode with combat) the difficulty is punishing and cleansing a map is tedious with a single optimal strategy. Which is too bad because it has some nice mechanics and systems. Basically the way to win is to rush a chain of lights over to where the corruption spawns and encircle it with lights within the first 2-3 game days. Then contain spawns with a couple of bullet towers while you rush town growth to supporting a bunch of crystal golems. Once that's ready slowly light creep into the corruption area until it's all gone. Enemy strength increases exponentially over time and with corruption size, so containing it ASAP is basically the only way to win.  Towers are useless beyond the first few in-game weeks and human military is too hard to replace so there's no real other options on offense either. This is really too bad because there are fun systems of towers and walls and production and building and magic. Unfortunately none of them matter because you can't fool around if you don't want to eventually be overwhelmed by the corruption's power growth. I can't imagine peaceful mode is much fun since over half the buildings and systems are useless if there's no combat. Custom difficulty lets you tweak variables that can slow the enemy growth but that only gives you more time to execute the one viable strategy. Sadly there doesn't seem to be a way to make the game more flexible.",148.6 hrs on record,N/A

You gain equipment that makes poker hands have extra effects, but the base set of cards never changes. However the game's biggest problem is it's just not interesting. You are presented with a lot of choices as you play, but all that does is present a false sense of variety. There are only a few equipment slot and each has only a tiny set of options. Artifacts that provide buffs are offered semi-frequently but impactful ones are few and far between. There are other minor issues - poorly themed cards (when only using 1-7 why employ clubs etc. when a more thematic choice like animals or elements would have worked) and poor writing (story is fine, but the banter was inane and endless so I ended up skipping everything). But really the only thing that matters is that the lack of deep choices means the game isn't fun to play. There are many actual deckbuilders that are much more fun than this game.

Every single intersection needs a signpost or people get lost and complain. This means even if you do your best to limit intersections, dozens of sign posts are required. Any time a new exit or line is added, you have to update every. single. one. It is a tedious nightmare. Your station gets so cluttered with sign post arrows you can't see anything that's going on, and their giant icons cover up each other and anything else you need to click on. And the worst thing is they don't even work. People will walk right under a sign with an arrow specifically for their destination and still turn around and walk the opposite direction. Apparently this problem is reduced by running the game in a slower mode, but since there's nothing to do except wait for people to finish walking that's akin to watching paint dry. Building pathways, adjusting to new station layouts, managing kiosk placement, all of it is excellent and should make for a fun game.

The road system is quite different than most games. One bot moves one item at a time per road segment. I found learning how to use this system efficiently to be an unexpected but fun challenge. The game is loaded with tons of charts and statistics which should make you happy if you love maximizing efficiency of a system. The lack of road bridges was a bit frustrating especially since you can make train bridges. I also didn't like exploring the map - you have to turret creep the entire map since robots can't explore on their own. The military missions involve rushing to put down as many towers as you can while rushing tower weaponry tech. I wasn't a fan but if you like tower rushing vs AI then you may enjoy it more than I did. The early campaign does a good job of introducing concepts, but got repetitive in later missions. I wish I'd just done a random map after about 3-4 missions. I found the train and boat systems to be very satisfying.

My favorite thing about this game is how it addresses the classic roguelite problem where more unlocks can mean less chance of getting what you want. Here you customize your drop pool, but there's also a required pool size which is big enough so there's still plenty of randomness in a run. I also really like the ""recoverable"" health mechanic which incentivizes limiting the amount of damage you take at once and lets you refill a chunk of what you lost next fight even if you finish a level damaged.

Some guns are very fun but most suck and there are very few chances in-run to get new guns. The vast majority of runs, even ones I won, I spent the entire time wishing my gun wasn't so aggressively unfun. Realistically though that comes down to opinion, guns I hate others may find amusingly quirky or whatever. Personal hangups aside this game is good at what it does.

Overall I'm having a good time but it's probably not for everyone. Note: there is no FOV slider so you should skip this game if you need one. + Unique aesthetic : The art style of this game is one of the most unique I've come across. I felt like it added greatly to the feel of the world and the fun of playing. + Roguelite builds : there's a lot of options in how you build your character each run, and plenty of unlockables to choose from as meta progression. = Decent combat : combat is standard lock-target melee, timed dodges, and spells + consumables. Not particularly smooth nor clunky imo. = Story : Repeatedly running the same area is explained nicely in-world and the meta story is fine. = Enemy variety : each biome has decent enemy variety but you have to clear 6 floors + a boss to get to a new biome - No FOV slider : I did not get motion sickness but everything felt ""off"" in the way that I know FOV fixes. This is probably a huge issue for people who are more sensitive. - Repetition : You unlock floor skipping as you progress, but you are very weak without the loot from clearing floors. Due to this the otherwise inoffensive enemy variety is rendered problematic. - Too many animations to skip : The mini scenes are fun the first few times but after that they really slow things down. The end of run loop is the worst offender, having like 5 separate bits to skip which is especially grating after a bad run. The real bummer here is that this game could be vastly improved with one simple fix - a global setting to scale enemy health/damage. Grinding early floors for loot and meta progression is not fun at the level this game requires. I would have rather turned down enemy health/damage and progressed more quickly.

76561197992783558,7,Lords and Villeins,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"A medieval town simulator with focus on differing castes and families that function as autonomous miniature economies. A brilliant concept hindered by some notable flaws. The way different households function as separate units is a very nice change of pace. In most games like this, everyone shares a universal resource pool and just grab whatever they need to work and survive. In this game professions have to buy things raw materials for their products, food, etc. And they can't build everything themselves, they have to call in carpenters/etc. for more advanced items. Clergy, Nobles, and Peasants/Artisans all function very differently, which creates a nice feeling of how separate their lifestyles are. Unfortunately the game also has some seriously frustrating aspects. Some game systems are problematic. Had a farm with hundreds of food in stock but it would only sell straw and wool at the market so everyone started starving. (I avoid that now by having 1 dedicated ""fiber"" farm and the rest for food.) Built 2 mineshafts over ""rich"" density that miners refused to use. (Still no idea how to fix this.) The UI buries useful information. Menus often have 15+ items and they are not sorted alphabetically and there is no way to filter them. Recipes are only shown in the build menu - they already exist in-game so they should be shown when clicking or hovering the workstation as well. Mass management stinks. The warehouse is a pain to navigate when you have a lot of families and items, especially when you need to review it so often. Other important management settings are all present but everything is several menus deep, for example if you are adding a new farm you have to click around a LOT to rebalance your crop shares. The campaign is long . I found it to be a great learning guide and it let me adjust and adapt to the game's issues, but its length and pacing may drive some players away. Don't get me wrong, I still really enjoy the game despite these flaws. The layered simulation is a unique and fun experience compared to other builders I've played, and the game gets better as you figure out the wonky systems and menus. But the learning process was not always fun and the frustrations I encountered will be deal breakers for some folks. A few final notes after finishing the campaign and a custom map: 1) Miners needed tools from the blacksmith to work in the mine shaft. I didn't find this explained anywhere in the UI. 2) I found the source of my farm sales problem. Families only bring a small chunk of goods to the marketplace but everything they want to sell is available if you force them to use shops in their zones. So one or the other is busted, and you should only use local shops never the marketplace. 3) It's nearly impossible to find information about game mechanics. Most guides and the wiki reference outdated values, like wrong straw/grain ratios for crops. Makes it hard to tell if the in-game hidden mechanics (like weight/meal ratios) are inaccurately described as well. 4) Some professions are so specialized as to be useless. The Bowyer is the worst offender, it only makes bows which almost nobody needs and rarely break, and it can pump out dozens per season. Ropemaker is another. 5) I found the noble houses' demands to be really frustrating, they basically required you to be able to produce every single item in the game and do a lot of tweaking to turn on/up production and turn off consumption. I played my custom game with them off and did not miss them. So yeah brilliant concept, iffy execution, only fun if you can look past a lot of frustration and  guesswork.

76561197992783558,7,Aces & Adventures,"Adventure, RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"A fast-paced poker + abilities card game with a good variety of builds to try out, but lacks depth and dynamic elements. Usually I find that a normal deck of playing cards pulls me out of the theme of a game. However I was won over by this game's character ability deck. It plays alongside the poker hands and the abilities are powerful, fun, and thematic to the character. You customize your ability deck in an editor and it doesn't change while you're playing. You unlock more cards and character passives after you complete adventures. There's a bunch of different adventures which are fun to play but they don't really change between runs, each one is mostly the same choices and encounters in the same order. I'm down to replay similar content to try out different characters and builds but I know that's not for everyone. There is a ""spiral"" mode that has randomized branching paths that let you build your deck as you go. But you can see the entire map at the start and once you figure out a winning strategy it's pretty easy to replicate it with a little planning, so this mode actually felt less interesting to me than the adventures. One of the main criticisms I see is that the ability deck + poker hand combo is boring and slow. In my experience things started slow but the frequent card and character level unlocks allowed me to edit decks to be much more fun and interesting. I also enjoyed updating the decks periodically to incorporate more new unlocks. Bottom line is folks who strongly prefer roguelike deckbuilders with high variance in each run probably won't like this, but if you enjoy tinkering with builds in a more static structure then I recommend giving this game a look.",78.6 hrs on record																					(25.3 hrs at review time),N/A

The game has extremely slow character progression and many flaws that add up to a product that's hard to enjoy. You control all the characters, having to swap between them to use abilities. Given the character's small health pools and short ability cooldowns, controlling multiple characters is pretty frustrating. If all your characters die you have to start the map over losing all progress. You can load a save but there's no checkpoints or autosave. Difficulty is inconsistent, you can be cruising through easy fights and suddenly hit a group that rolls you before you can react. I had to get in the habit of manually saving after every single encounter, which was pretty annoying. Sometimes characters don't attack enemies that are attacking them or their allies and sometimes they don't acquire a new target when their current target dies. You have to monitor your characters carefully to make sure they're not standing around dying without fighting back. Other minor issues include lack of UI scaling, only 3 skill slots, unit positioning, character selection issues, etc. I did like the feed skill system, skills generally felt pretty good, and it was nice being able to try out different skills with no penalty. Too bad it takes so very very long to unlock new skills. Between the frustrating mechanics and nearly nonexistent character growth, I couldn't force myself to finish the third mission.

You can feel the same brand of weirdness across the board, from player movement to wacky plot delivery to the various game systems. Fortunately none of it is taken to the same level as E.Y.E haha The game is a bit buggy - I had to restart one mission because an event didn't properly trigger, and another because I fell through the world. Combat abilities allow you to approach combat in wildly different ways but it takes a bit of grind to afford unlocks so you can't really try stuff out for fun. A refund/respec option would made the game much better imo. Different enemy types fight in unique ways which is quite fun, unfortunately there's only one set of enemies so it does start to get stale after several missions. Weapons aren't very well balanced, it feels like some are just plain better than others. The loot quality system feels frustrating as a result. Oh and the inventory management system is flat out terrible. I really enjoyed combat as a whole (abilities, enemies, etc).

You die in a couple shots, but you fail the mission if you hit an enemy waving a gun at you before they shoot even if their compatriots in the same room have already fired upon you, meaning armed encounters feel unrealistic and unfair. There's no variety in mechanics so you end up doing the same tedious door checking and room clearing over and over, which is especially frustrating since any mistake requires a full restart of the mission.

76561197992783558,8,Frozenheim,"Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"A simple RTS with numerous problems. Pathing is really bad, units get stuck on stuff or will start heading in the wrong direction for no reason, the biggest offender being gatherers getting stuck on their own gathering building and sitting around doing nothing without telling you. You can't hotkey buildings. The basic harvester building (wood) requires its own resource to be built. There is no way to get enough limited goods (iron, stone, etc) long term without trading in the marketplace building, which requires a limited resource (stone) to build. Forget to build it soon enough and you're screwed. The camera behaves very badly when you have to move it over high ground, which is a frequent occurrence. Picking one squad out of a larger group centers the camera on that squad. So if you are trying to manage individual squads out of a hotkey group, your point of view will get jerked around for no reason. If you are trying to refill a squad but you can't for any reason, the game will not tell you why. So you have to figure out which resource you're short on, or maybe you're just not in range of the healer which for some reason is the only place you can refill your squads. If you have multiple squads of different types selected at once, you can only see one squad's abilities. This means efficient hotkey groups are limited to one type of unit. The game will not warn you when your buildings are under attack, your units will silently sit still and die to an enemy shooting them from out of their line of sight, but you will get blasted with noisy notifications at you any time a ship appears in your area of vision. You can't unload units from boats without emptying the whole boat. Extra annoying if you accidentally put a wrong unit on a boat, because then you have to launch and then re-beach to try again. You can't set production limits on resource refinement buildings (i.e. skins to clothes). This is a big problem because some things need the raw resource, so you have to manually toggle those buildings on and off all the time. For such a basic RTS there are way too many flaws to make it worth your while. Look elsewhere in the genre, this one is a hard pass.",4.0 hrs on record,N/A

The numerous unlockable characters and the world map with semi-randomized events make it stand out from other similar games. Some map nodes do require earlier nodes, which mean either doing multiple time consuming runs to figure out how to complete events or using a guide. Higher difficulties (madness) will restrict you to stronger character build choices. Neither of which are necessarily bad things, depends on personal preference. The game does reward replay in a lot of ways - exploring events, unlocking pets and new characters, allowing you to build your party any way you want, unlocking passive buffs, upgrading the town, etc. The UX is also quite good. Lots of ways to search/filter cards to find what you want. You can save multiple different passive and deck loadouts. Inspected cards contain good info on effects.

The theme, the art, the story, the world, all the sorts of things I want from a base building game. Unfortunately it is missing some very basic management tools so maintaining a simple functioning base is extremely difficult. I feel bad giving this a thumbs down, but it's so frustrating trying to maintain production chains that I cannot recommend this game. --------------------------------------------------------- Good: + Theme is fun and well represented in the world + Not grid based and buildings are interesting + Nice art and animations + The game builds a good story, especially with the gods and natural enemy + Expeditions are a fun layer on top of regular base building Neutral: = The tutorial is nice but very short. Fortunately most of the game mechanics are pretty easy to figure out. = Base maps are smallish, but there's still a lot to do. Bad: - No production limits, all goods get overproduced wasting resources. - Goods output cannot be used until moved to a storage building. - No task priority ranking, so you have to way overpopulate with haulers and gatherers. Like half your population or more. - The combination of the above problems means you will struggle with your production chain even when your base is sitting on a pile of raw resources. - You can help (but not solve) the above by manually editing a few workers to forbid hauling/gathering everything except for one or two key resources. Unfortunately units die frequently and you can't save forbid presets so you have to manually reapply your forbids. You also can't see stats of a dead unit so you'll have to look at the full roster to see if a focused unit needs to be rebuilt. - Units behave badly (refuse to work, etc) when needs are not met, making the supply chain problem a real killer. - If key resources only exist very far apart, you will struggle to harvest them. You can't see resource placement when picking a map. - Tunnels exist to speed far travel but they require a lot of materials to build and units have to walk to the end point to build it so it takes forever to build them. Suggestions: * Add production limits. If I could stop making planks once I have X extra stocked then log input becomes less of a problem and haulers are freed up to move other stuff around. If I could stop gathering frogs once I have X amount I could get the other resources I need. And I wouldn't need to do the frustrating ""forbid"" juggling. * Let tunnels be built from the start point. Add extra work units per distance so builders have spend time ""reaching"" the end point. At least that way they will be in base to meet their needs instead of spending multiple seasons for one trip out and back hauling materials. * Show a simple map preview when picking maps. Having to restart because the one stone mine is across the entire map from the 2 iron mines stinks. A solid background with colored squares for resource types would be sufficient. * Let me reiterate, production limits. If that was the only thing that was fixed this game would probably be a thumbs up from me where I rave about the atmosphere.",14.4 hrs on record,N/A

The only real curveball is rising water levels but aside from that, most of the challenge comes from not overdoing any one terraforming change, and it seemed impossible to break the planet beyond recovery. Single player has a story, I didn't find it particularly good or bad. There is also some conflict that pushes you to worry about something more than just leisurely plonking down buildings. Unfortunately I didn't like this addition, it was fine plot-wise and mechanic-wise but I felt the controls for it were quite awful, My biggest complaint about either game mode is the lack of proper filters. Highlighting all factories of X type or Y level, or all nodes of a certain resource, would have been a massive time saver in a game that could have used it. Overall the game was enjoyable, but I only recommend it if you are okay with the very slow pace. 20+ hours for single player, 10+ hours for multiplayer, and in both much of the time is spent repetitively putting down the same set of buildings and very gradually expanding your influence over territory and atmosphere.",40.5 hrs on record,N/A

It's also easy to see which units have bonuses. + An overlay shows what every building produces and lets you click to cancel specific products. + When acquiring new building types, it easy easy to see if you can already make its products and at what quality.

There's almost no reason to replay a level once you've beaten it, so I strongly disagree with the ""Replay Value"" tag and it does not feel like a roguelike. You get lots of choices per level, but you in order to generate enough currency to make an impact you have to take actions that generate money or cost nothing the vast majority of the time. On top of that the level's starting loadout (minions, relics, etc) doesn't change, meaning repeat plays of a level feel extremely samey and unsatisfying. Fortunately levels loadouts differ a decent amount, and different keepers have different playstyles so that also provides variety. So even though every level is only worth beating once, there's a good chunk of content to play through. The gameplay is fun enough, the meat of it is planning group positions based on enemy attacks and weaknesses. Unfortunately there's not a lot of enemy variety so after the first campaign you've seen basically every enemy ability you're going to encounter. I'm halfway through the second campaign and running out of steam, not sure if the game is interesting enough to beat with all 3 default keepers.

You get a couple of seconds of sprint, and to re-sprint you have to release your sprint button and re-press it. The minimap is too small to see anything and there's no local map so there's lots of running around looking for stuff. I found this especially unnecessary in the safe areas with their spread out stations. Stamina capacity also decays quickly requiring the constant intake of food. The other major pain point is the storms. At the start of the game there is literally nothing else to do other than go into the wilderness and forage. But if a storm comes, you have no choice but to sit in town and do nothing. Sleeping burns stamina cap so even that isn't a good option. Other offenses abound like wasting resources to find valid recipes, requiring the player to press and hold a key to perform simple actions, the sometimes problematic camera with no controls, etc. Hell the multiple launch splash screens are unskippable and pause when you alt-tab.

Gets repetitive after 3-4 maps, but was fun enough that I still enjoyed it all the way through. The town and towers both have a nice progression. Managing the population's needs and building tower combos was very satisfying. Unfortunately once you figure things out, every map sort of becomes a repetition of your best plan. For me after the 3rd map my base build order and tower selection were pretty static, although I enjoyed the core loop enough that I didn't mind. I think things could have been kept a bit more interesting if later maps had varying criteria, like certain tower types are weakened or seasonal effects like a long winter or summers with stronger waves so you had to focus tower building in the spring, etc. Another minor issue is that even though there are 8 damage types, only 4 or 5 are viable as the damage focus, and the way the towers cross cancel eachother and require adjacent buffs really limits your tower choices. I think it would have been more fun if you could stack any 3 damage types with benefits or some other system that allowed a better variety of choices to try out.

Regardless of your strategy, starting a good deck requires getting a few very strong cards. Since enemies scale by map not by encounter, the best way to get cards is to explore every single combat and event square in the first 2 maps.

There is no warning, there is no way to avoid this happening, every so often you take a giant hit to your resources and time. Earthquakes damage buildings. Your workers don't repair buildings until they're under 30% health, or lower if it takes them time to get to the task. Any low health building will be broken by earthquakes, meaning until you repair damaged structure and replace broken equipment, that building will not produce output. There is no way to mitigate this damage either. In a game where it is critical to squeeze the maximum out of your supply lines, these disasters are needlessly punishing and unfairly unavoidable. Even on the lowest frequency setting they are game ruining. I did enjoy the game on with disasters turned off, so I can recommend it if you want a simple supply chain / logistics game.

76561197992783558,10,Aurora Dusk: Steam Age,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"A fun game system with an okay campaign and not very fun sandbox. Gameplay revolves around building up a city (production buildings and defenses) to defeat an enemy base. What really sets it apart is that while you have control over your own character, the rest of the citizenry has a mind of its own. If they want armor, they'll build a forge. If they need food they'll go cook some. They'll even build defensive towers. Full 100% autonomy with no limitations. You don't get to plan out every building and action, the NPCs are largely making their own decisions. The tradeoff is less control and sometimes NPC actions would compete with your preferred resource use, but overall it really made it feel like I was in a world of actual people, which I really enjoyed. You do still have heavy influence on your town's progression, for example if you start a big/expensive project the NPCs will work on finishing it, and you can build extras of resource generation buildings to encourage that type of output. Unfortunately the game doesn't do a whole lot with this. The campaign was fine, putting you through various scenarios with various challenges, and it was a nice introduction to the games' tech progression and combat strategies. Sometimes it felt a little repetitive but overall I enjoyed it. Sandbox mode is where the game really came up short in my opinion. The inability to recruit more people made things feel very limited, and fighting AI didn't feel very satisfying since they basically were towns just like yours minus a human character guiding/pushing them forward. I think this type of system could be really fun and chaotic if thrown into a more dynamic living world: NPCs with unlimited autonomy populating a city the human character influences and contributes to without direct control, in a world of similar cities, with populations and borders that could fluctuate at will. The concept of this game is great and I enjoyed playing the campaign but overall it feels like a cool idea in search of a world to live in. If you want a few hours of fun experiencing that sort of unfulfilled potential, then I cautiously recommend this game.",13.3 hrs on record,N/A

76561197992783558,10,Cardaclysm,"RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"An okay deckbuilder with some annoying mechanics and grind. It's worth a look but it's not for everyone. You have to build a deck of 14 cards. You draw 4 at a time, and you only draw new cards to replace ones you've used. You get a fixed amount of money and souls to summon creatures, which can trap you having 4 cards you can't play. You can redraw before your first turn so you can see up to 8 cards, but that's barely over half your deck so if there's one or two cards you're counting on, good luck. As you play you get things to remedy this situation - cards that allow drawing or generate money, more money and souls so you can afford to play more/better stuff, cheap cards that are good enough to fill in between expensive cards. But at the start, the restrictions feel awful and unfun. That's probably why this game has a mixed rating - it really sucks at the beginning. It's pretty fun at the midpoint, having enough resources and fighting enemies that are easy enough to try different decks. Unfortunately the late game dips back into mediocrity. Enemies are punishing in very specific ways, so the vast majority of cards you've got are useless. Artifacts are critical for passive buffs to beat these enemies, but they come in slowly until you're strong enough to play on the hardest mode. Another annoyance was the grind to enter the final arena. You have to collect 60 keys, and by the time I had 30 I was ready to go - I had every artifact and a deck that was on autopilot through every fight. Grinding out another 30 keys was not exciting. The final stage was interesting, a series of fights against very powerful enemies that made me build custom decks . I found that to be a fun challenge and a nice finish to the game. For me this game was fun enough to justify the rough beginning and late game grind, but not everyone will feel the same. Cautiously recommended if you want a deckbuilder and you're willing to accept some frustrating restrictions as part of the challenge.",43.9 hrs on record,N/A
76561197992783558,10,Founders' Fortune,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"This game has its high points (especially a nice construction system) but citizen management is bad and only gets worse the longer you play. My last 10 hours or so were not enjoyable, I just wanted to ""finish"" the game. The game doesn't do anything interesting enough to justify enduring this frustration. Villagers constantly insult each other for no reason, causing a nasty mood debuff. As your colony grows this becomes a bigger problem so you frequently have to micromanage them to apologize or have positive interactions. Children are incredibly powerful but require boatloads of micro. Villagers won't have kids unless you micro a pair through about a dozen interactions (or more if they're not already at max relationship). Then the kids need to study but studying makes them sad and if they get too sad they get permanent debuffs. It's an endless chore juggling them on/off studying. Villagers will take extended breaks even when they're at maximum happiness, so you have to constantly check (and adjust) what they're doing. You can't prioritize tasks within a profession, so if someone wants to care for animals instead of tend time-sensitive crops it's up to you to redirect their attention. The bigger and more advanced your colony becomes the worse these problems are. I never grew my colony beyond 7 citizens because it was so miserable managing just that amount.

76561197992783558,11,Surviving the Aftermath,"Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"This game is full of unintuitive systems that punish you for not knowing how they work. If you like this game conceptually I recommend you check out Endzone instead. An example of what I'm talking about is the starting tech system. You cannot generate science without unlocking specific techs and the game will let you spend your finite starting science on other unrelated techs, leaving you locked out of the tech tree. And without science income, you might as well quit. Within the first 30 in-game days you need to be constantly unlocking tech in order to keep your colony from collapsing. The tutorial doesn't warn you about this. The game's unsearchable help doesn't tell you to rush outposts. It's an arbitrary weird system that drops you into a failure state without warning. The only way to avoid it is to know beforehand how it works, either from experience or from an external source. And that's pretty much how the whole game is built. Simple tasks like making clothes require 3 separate tech unlocks, so by the time you know there's a problem you're screwed. You can unlock buildings that need materials you haven't researched yet. Resource gathering buildings cost their own resource to build. It doesn't help that the tutorial prompts are flat out terrible, frequently instructing you to perform tasks that have no bearing on your colony's survival or to construct buildings that you're literally hours away from researching. I like to figure out a game's systems by trying things out instead of watching an instructional video or following a step by step guide.

Gameplay is summon units into 4 fixed slots, throw around buffs/debuffs, fight an opponent doing the same. It's ok but not really interesting or exciting. Deckbuilding lacks proper search, there's only a couple of category filters. You also have to mouse over each card and wait for a tooltip to pop up to see what it is. Makes the process slow and annoying. New cards unlock slowly, usually 2-3 low quality cards per mission. Getting an actual useful card is pretty rare, and it takes forever to accumulate enough cards to try to build a themed deck. You can buy cards but they're so expensive it's not a viable option early on. You're presented with several missions at once, with no difficulty indication. This is exacerbated by the fact that a given mission's difficulty may vary wildly on different attempts. Combat doesn't have a ""fast"" mode, so you have to sit through the same animations every time a card is played. They're quick but completely unnecessary, it's just wasted time that left me feeling frustrated. The game oddly leaves giant black bars on the side of the screen at 1080 resolution. It feels like it was designed around a square display. And the space certainly could be used - for example the deckbuilding UI could display 6+ more cards. After about 15 missions of samey combat I didn't feel the need to keep fighting the UI. This one is a definite skip.",4.8 hrs on record																					(4.1 hrs at review time),N/A

I wish there was a line-of-sight overlay so I could see which of my towers were obstructed and which are not. Tip: blocks are not solid (maybe platform would be a more accurate name), so towers behind blocks can still shoot unobstructed. Update: I've beat endless and roguelike modes. Endless wasn't that interesting, having all the cards made it pretty easy, and the performance tanks hard on later waves.

The game is pretty simple, it's easy to make money and management of park elements like food and staff is very lightweight. While not necessarily a bad thing, people looking for a management focused simulation will be disappointed. Pressure to expand your park comes from the desire for more currency to build cooler stuff and get more dinos. Graphically and thematically it is definitely cartoony, even the ""realistic"" dino mode is still not very realistic. It all works well as a package though.

Combat is fun, characters play differently, there are decent build options via the skill tree and gear. Single player gets quite grindy with it being tough to pass mid-tier missions in one go. Playing with friends is much better,  clearing most missions in 1 attempt. Having a healer to support your damage and vice-versa makes a world of difference. It feels like a game that was built for multiplayer not single-player, and it could work really well if the population playing wasn't so small. It's very easy to drop into other players' public games mid mission which is nice. It uses a gearscore system, where your gear level defines how powerful you are, so in order to keep advancing you have to constantly throw out gear you like to slap in whatever new high level thing you find. Unfortunately it means you can't try to assemble gear into some kind of build while leveling. An absolute mistake in a game like this. The end game (gearscore 130+) is extremely repetitive, requiring 10+ runs to farm up decent parts to build just 1 piece of good gear. My crew gave up after we realized how slow progress was. Still, getting to that point was a good time. There is a very serious bug - if you get revived by a partner, there's a split-second window before temp invuln kicks in where you can be killed. After that there is no way to bring you back, even if your team advances to a new wave in a Colosseum. Other than that the game crashes a lot more than it should.

It is very hard to support a growing colony without it, for water and for food via the early-ish fishing tech. 2) Burn the crafted item ""packed leaves"", not wood. 3 leaves via a crafting table provide as much fuel as 10 wood, and leaves are infinitely farmable by shaking trees (suggestion credit to Magic Lantern).",62.5 hrs on record																					(19.3 hrs at review time),N/A

Going 1 block at a time sucks. - Poor crafting UI Not searchable, no way to quickly see what you can currently craft, no way to sort outside of prefab categories. - Crafting mats are too rare Everything beyond the bottom tier craftables require crystals, which very rarely drop.

Skills unlock slowly so there's not much choice in what to equip, and usually only 1 skill bonus is worth having per tier (mana regen and group damage buffs aren't needed while leveling). 4) Friends don't matter Everything dies so fast that grouping while questing is pointless.

You bring 3 characters (9 to choose from) and each has 3 combat styles plus a passive skill grid, so there's lots of build combos. Gear and socketing are really well integrated into deck strategy, the camping minigame is surprisingly fun, node types and path items make map planning more impactful. Overall the UI does a decent job of letting you manage all the moving parts, which is no small task. I also enjoyed campaign mode although it's only 2/3(?) finished right now, so the ending is a bit abrupt. There are elements that may give some players pause. It takes a while to get enough cards/gear/etc to sculpt your build, you spend a lot of time fiddling with stuff between battles, and you eventually reach a point where you've got the cards you want so your only upgrades come outside of that (gear/gems/passives).

76561197992783558,13,The Survivalists,"Action, Adventure, Casual, Indie",Recommended,"This is an okay survival game. Good exploration and progression and combat, with some UI and automation problems. What makes this game different is the monkeys, units you can command to repeat your last action. They are both fun and frustrating. Exploring feels rewarding and progression is well defined. It's not too grindy, there's a good balance between needing to farm mats and getting to do other stuff. Combat feels pretty good, it's easy to die if you don't pay attention but it's not very challenging beyond that. It would be nice if enemies had a different health bar color than friendlies. The differing islands are fun but the raft has a weird floaty momentum that makes steering a chore. It is too hard to see objects behind other things especially in dense forests, give me transparency or outlines please. The UI really needs to let you track resource stocks, or all chests need to merge into one display. Hunting for stuff is painful and it's impossible to know when you're running out of something. Multiplayer works well but the non-host cannot get quest rewards, leaving them lacking a few of the trinkets if they don't redo them in their own game. For those standard features nothing stands out as particularly good or bad. It's the monkeys that make this game different from others I've played in the genre. Saving monkeys feels rewarding both roleplay wise and mechanically. Having a pack of minions to help fight or do tasks is a lot of fun, and automating my town was quite satisfying. Unfortunately, as much as I enjoyed the monkeys' basics, I found a lot of frustration in their management. You can't set chest categories so having them automate storage makes inventory even harder to monitor, and I can never tell what area of ground they will decide to cover. Assigning tasks is unnecessarily time consuming. Having to perform the task myself is a fun concept but not fun gameplay. Having to manually swap their gear is tedium that I could live without. Their job AI isn't great, when mining/chopping they'll bounce between nodes on opposite sides of a large area ignoring closer ones, and countless times they've told me ""no more rocks/trees"" when standing right next to one. The core of the game is solid: combat is ok, exploring is fun, progression is good. Monkeys are a novel and fun concept that sort of work in practice. I listed a lot of complaints but they hold the game back from being really good rather than make it bad. You should watch some videos showing how monkey controls work before you make your purchase decision.",46.3 hrs on record																					(36.7 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197992783558,13,Tainted Grail: Conquest,"Action, Indie, RPG",Recommended,"Starts slow, but once it gets going there's a ton of fun content built on top of a solid deck builder. One warning - the controller implementation is pretty bad, be ready for some serious frustration if you're not using mouse+key. For the first couple of hours I felt frustrated and found unlocks to come trickling in too slowly, but after unlocking a handful of new cards and abilities I began unlocking more per run. Runs have been taking me about an hour each, which is a nice length imo, and you can save and exit any time (thank you!) Deckbuilding is competent but a bit hit or miss in my limited experience. There's a ton of classes to unlock, the 2 I've tried have been nicely themed even if playstyles are a bit similar (mitigating incoming damage is key because healing is limited). Base decks are pretty boring and it takes a bit to pick up enough cards/passives for things to be interesting. Story and atmosphere are fun, there's a ton of events and NPCs to encounter, I really like the concept of the world so far. There's a lot of upgrades to unlock but I've only earned enough currency for a couple. Playing via controller (XBOX) has been super frustrating. Card selection is done via thumbstick instead of dpad, and there's no dead zone so it's way too easy to accidentally move up/down when you only want to move left/right. DPAD can spend consumables even if they're not shown on screen, cancel/confirm buttons are not consistent, etc etc. I've definitely had some rage inducing moments caused purely by the controller implementation. If you like deckbuilders this is 100% worth a look, especially if you like the atmosphere. Prepare yourself for some frustrations if you use a controller.

As always I recommend treating Early Access games as if they're complete, that way you can't be disappointed if updates are slow or stop. It has all the basics you'd want - a nice tech progression, needs to meet (air, water, food, power), exploration and foraging mechanics. Combat is new and could use some tweaks, it's not good but it's not bad. My only complaint is lightning is a little too harsh - get caught too far from base and it's easy to get zapped twice and die :x Most players should expect 6-12 hours to feel ""done"". Once you've explored the surrounding area and teched and built what you want, there's nothing to keep going for. The price is fair, the content is limited but decent, and the cuteness is 100% delivered.

I've tried this with friends a few times and we haven't had fun with it. Maybe there's some secret sauce I'm missing but a game like this shouldn't require a strategy guide. The slightest mistake undoes half the work you've done, and the further you get the more things are going on at once.

76561197992783558,14,Magic of Autumn,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"This game has its high points and low points, it's a good value for the cost but not everyone will enjoy it. The card battling is interesting, you don't get to re-use cards so you have to carefully build your deck and choose how you play. I found it very thought provoking and a fun challenge, but you cannot expect a traditional deck shuffler here. The atmosphere is very nice, I liked the art style and the story snippets contributed nicely to the feel of the world. The system of learning spells (cards) by interacting with things made the world feel alive, although it was frustrating to figure out I had missed something and have to go back and find it. Also some stuff moved around frustratingly out of reach, it took me about 10 minutes of patrolling a corner waiting for one thing to pass close enough. The map desperately needs a ""You are here"" marker, especially given how unlocking runes reveals the map - when you have to skip hard nodes and leave them for later it can be very difficult to figure out where you are. The fight and card balancing isn't perfect. Sometimes for a given fight there's a trick to figure out which is a lot of fun, but sometimes it felt like I was just mashing restart until the enemy got a very bad draw AND I got a very good draw. This was especially true in the ""Darkness and decay"" level, about 25% of the time the opponent would kill me with an unstoppable one-turn combo on turn 1 or 2. Playing through just the story skipping optional fights would only take a few hours. The majority of my play time was spent struggling through the harder optional fights and eventually figuring them out - but for the most part I really enjoyed that process. Overall the game has some real high points and some real flaws. If you're looking for a tightly balanced traditional deckbuilder with high replay value, this is not it. But if you want something unique with nice atmosphere and solid mechanics and you can forgive some flaws, this game is quite nice especially for the asking price.",11.3 hrs on record,N/A

76561197992783558,14,SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"Adventure, RPG",Recommended,"This game is like a masterclass in bad design. Let's dive right in. 1) Combat is mindless. Attacks lack impact or any interesting qualities. AE is worthless because it's much better to focus down single targets, DoTs are nearly worthless for the same reason. The only strategy involved is throwing away cards so you can chain 3 of the same color together, which is about as exciting as it sounds. 2) Character balance is nonexistent. Casting 3 mage spells for high damage topped with the shield chain is better than anything else you can do, if all I had were 3 mage cards I could have cruised through the first 5 chapters. This makes the other characters feel useless and being forced to bring 8 cards from each feels punishing rather than challenging or fun. 3) You can't fully skip story scenes. Yes there's a skip button, but you still have to watch all the characters go through their actions at 2x speed AND in most story scenes you have to hit the skip button multiple times otherwise the story resumes. I got tired of the tropey overdone dialoge, and trying to skip it was its own form of torture. 4) Walking around. Why on earth do I have to walk around between fights, poking every stray bush for loot, testing map borders for hidden areas. Even sped up it feels slow and unnecessary. 5) Side areas. They're often full of loot, but if you accidentally find the boss you get booted out to the next map. You can go back and replay chapters you've finished, but you have to redo every single fight. I missed 50% of the loot in one chapter because I am bad at spotting what's a side area and what's not. Drudging through the whole level again was not fun at all. 6) Healers can't heal outside of combat. The consequence of this is the final enemy of every battle turns into a tedium of farming action points so you can top off your characters' health. Boring stacked on boring, terrible pointless mechanic. Dull cards, bad mechanics, tedious combat, frustrating non-combat, not a good game.",4.6 hrs on record,N/A

Primary attack is a slow moving spinning projectile that you have to wait to return to fire again. The slow movement means that it can take a really long time to return especially if you're moving backwards to avoid damage. The projectile also has an unpredictable hitbox so it will sometimes miss things you're aiming at nearly dead on, or bounce off things you thought you were clear of. Secondary attack has a lot of charges but a long cooldown. It's good but can't be used as a replacement for primary. The time stop mechanic was fun and had interesting uses, probably the best part of the game. You have to kill every enemy in the map to advance, and there's no minimap or any indicator of where the last enemies are so if you miss tiny bit of the map I hope you like backtracking. Maps are small but it's still annoying, most games get around this by giving you an arrow pointing to the enemies when you're down to 1 or 2 remaining. The food mechanic is kind of annoying as well, in order to heal you store up food but to find food you have to kill the rare rabbits or break barrels for a low chance of food drops - and you can only break them with your magic attack (wasting charges) or a hammer that doesn't return so you have to walk to it to pick it up. I found myself leaving barrels to the end and if I needed food doing even more backtracking. I did not enjoy combat and I find backtracking incredibly annoying.

Upgrades cost materials, but they only exist at the station where you earn them. And to move them between stations you have to do a full cargo run (defend against enemies etc). There's limited routes between stations, some stations only craft some upgrade types, some upgrades require all material types, and you have limited cargo space. Gathering stuff where you need it takes many many runs. In order to upgrade my ship to take on harder stuff, I was probably going to have to spend 5+ hours doing runs for materials or cash, repeating many routes I'd already mastered. And that's just for the current set of upgrades, I can already see better upgrades that take even more material types.

76561197992783558,15,Godhood,"RPG, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"This is a pretty good autobattler RPG (not a god game) with some quirks that could be deal breakers for some people. There's a lot of stuff done right - buildings and theology choices let you sculpt your tribe, you get plenty of choices to customize individual units, the pattern of 3 turns then a fight provides a nice cycle, and there's replay value in playing new religions with different classes and combat types. But there are a few things that some people might not like. - Battles are random Battles are a 3v3 fight where you don't control the units. Your opponents might focus down one guy or do nothing useful, same for your team. You can mitigate this via carefully picking your party members and building their abilities over time, but the same fight can be an easy win or rough loss based on pure chance. Yes this is the nature of an autobattler but I didn't feel like the game pitched itself as such so I think it's important for buyers to know. - Units age out Your units eventually hit old age and get a massive defensive debuff that makes them useless. I usually don't like games that make you throw away your hard won heroes, but this one has an okay balance to it - you get a decent number of fights before it's trash time. - Plan ahead for stuff you can't see Units age out, new recruits lack levels AND get a debuff while they're young, so you have to plan many (4+) fights ahead. The problem is you can't see the next island, so you have to take note when you're choosing an island about what the next one is likely to be. Add to this the fact that each element has a counter, and it's pretty frustrating to not be able to see what's coming next. If none of those sound like a big deal, then this is probably a good game for you. In fact I usually don't like random battle and units ageing out, but this game isn't too harsh with those mechanics - I still enjoyed playing til I got a victory. Still those 2 combined with the frustration of planning ahead for things I can't see was enough that I won't be going for a second playthrough, especially when I expect it to clock 6-8 hours.

76561197992783558,15,Atomic Society,"Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"The game is functional and it introduces some interesting concepts to the genre, but the UI needs a lot of work and the core loop isn't that interesting/fun. The devs recently said they're nearly done with early access, but imo what you get right now is below average for the genre. Your leader is a super human of sorts, able to build and gather at a very fast rate and perform other special tasks. Being able to directly control a single citizen with outsize influence provides the player a bit more direct control of the colony's fate than is typical in games like this, which is nice. Shaping your town by defining repercussions (beatings, jail, execution, acceptance, encouragement) for certain social situations (stealing, murder, abortion, homosexuality) is a super interesting concept, but I found the outcome of all choices to be minor changes in population growth. The system really needs something more impactful to make it feel meaningful, maybe visual events enacted by citizens or some sort of notification when something actually happens as a result of your laws. Aside from that the UI is pretty frustrating. Live display of key resources and unemployed/homeless citizens should be mandatory in a game like this, instead you have to open various submenus. The game warns you when problems exist but you can't tell if you're close to a problem state, for example you can see homeless citizens but not vacant home slots. Food and water arrive in big chunks with long gaps in between, without stats tracking it's impossible to evaluate production over time. The game will unpause if you do anything (even if you open your warehouse to see your stocks) which... is just not how pause should work. And honestly the town doesn't feel alive. Nothing you do feels like it has an impact. Buildings look the same if they're in use or empty. Citizens look the same regardless of job or happiness or faction. Other than rotting corpses, at glance there's no way to see if my town is doing well or not - the game tells you what is going on but rarely shows you.

76561197992783558,15,As Far As The Eye,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"A pretty game with a brilliant concept hampered by bugs, bad UI/UX, and poor balance. There are some unfortunately severe bugs present given that the last bugfix patch was in Oct 2020. Things I have encountered include the game thinking I don't have enough population slots (if you have 4 workers but 3 slots, only 3 can work. Multiple times I had 4 slots but only 3 workers were allowed to work, which is a massive setback) and sometimes the game flat out loses/deletes resources & units when you load a saved game (in a game where you will regularly only have 3 or 4 units, having 1 disappear is essentially game over). I understand that the game is random and balance is often luck. But there are too many random things that will kill your run if just 1 happens early. Also you might as well restart if you get a bad set of starting units, because the difference between getting a balanced squad and one that has useless skills is huge. Not to mention that some unit traits (i.e. Agile) are game-breaking powerful. The UI/UX is really bad. I had an event that said idle units will get sick, and a unit en route to interact with a Caravan (friendly NPC) was counted as being idle without warning. Sometimes the game notifies me when a unit has no job, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes I get a bonus at the start of a run due to last run, sometimes I don't, with no indication why. Given the state of the game it's difficult to say if those are bugs or bad UX. In the UI it's too hard to see what unit you have selected (and the game constantly swaps selection on you without warning), it's too hard to see at a glance what units are doing, and since they all look the same it's too hard to remember which unit you want to specialize in which job. The concept of a moving base is brilliant, and the way you have to manage production and unit skills and cargo space is really fun. The bad UI/UX alone could have been tolerable quirks, but the bugs push this review into the negative.

Combat spawned too much stuff all over the place with no good way of covering the ground. Building required you to run and jump all over to gather resources to build your defenses while under a timer which was just not fun at all. Since the defense sections are the meat of the game, it wasn't worth continuing. Other reviews say it is too hard solo and co-op may be better, but I played it co-op. Since each character can only build one type of thing, and one character is useless in combat, playing co-op does not significantly improve the experience. In fact I thought it was more designed to be played solo since it would make more sense to have both characters together to build both types of defense in one spot and to build combo buildings, and you would be able to fight and repair at the same time.

If you're itching for this type of game it's still worth a look, but you might want to wait to see if it improves over time. ------------------------------------- original review It's hard to match up against Hades but if you want something similar this is a solid option. It is in Early Access but it's playable with a decent amount of content and the devs have been active with a promising roadmap [medievalien.com] Combat is okay. It controls well with WASD and remappable keys. There's a good selection of regular enemies, elites have fun abilities but could use a couple more types for variety. The only character type (currently) is ranged, weapons are mostly bows but there's a pretty good mix of types and modifiers so you have a decent feeling of choice. Abilities are fun and mix into combat well. There is a good variety of loot (weapons, abilities, passives) and enemies. There are permanent upgrades but it looks like it'll take a good number of runs to progress through the unlocks. Runs are a bit longer than I'm used to for this type of game. I'm averaging 90-120 minutes for the first map alone and I've seen 2 maps thus far. You can save on exit and resume later at any location, which prevents the length from being problematic. So whether the game length is good bad or neutral comes down to what you prefer. The map is a clone of Slay the Spire, crisscrossing paths with nodes of different types like combat, shops, random event, etc. One nice difference is you can insert up to 2 modifiers into each node to change various things - loot quality, add elite enemies, even change encounter type. You get random modifiers as loot from combat. In combat nodes there are several rooms with map icons that show you most loot, chests, health, shops, etc. Most rooms have teleporters that you can jump to whenever you want. I am a big fan of this feature since it seriously cuts down on time spent backtracking This is already a good action roguelite worth the asking price imo.

The very rare use of quest markers would have been annoying if the levels were not so mindlessly linear. Playing as wizard, combat involved holding down one attack button until everything around me died. Capping the campaign difficulty was a huge mistake, the only reason the final boss took longer than 10 seconds to beat was because it teleported a few times. 99% of the enemies are trash mobs that behave exactly the same as eachother. Loot was not cool or interesting. It may look like there's a lot of skills, unfortunately it's just 3 versions of everything, which made picking what skills to equip an exercise in disappointment. The ""god"" skill tree added nothing of value. Having to burn points and slots on movement abilities is really weak, especially when there's so much walking to be done. I really can't think of anything I enjoyed about this game. There's so many better ARPGs out there, don't waste your time on this one.",14.5 hrs on record																					(8.7 hrs at review time),N/A

I don't think the roguelike tag fits. When replaying a level, it's all the same rooms just in different spots, and you don't get any power ups or gear or abilities or anything to change things up during the levels. Starting over when you die is not fun or interesting in any way. Outside of that, there are a lot of other design problems. Dungeons are long and you can't leave and resume later where you left off. There is tons of backtracking to schelp keys back to locks you found many rooms ago. The game doesn't pause while you search your inventory for the specific item you need to cure the debuff that is killing you. The madness effect is a nauseating strobing screenwobble and there's very few ways to improve sanity to make it go away. There's barely any combat, dodge roll requires weird positioning, doors trick you into walking into traps, stamina depletes when out of combat, etc. Strong not recommended on this one.",4.4 hrs on record,N/A

I don't think it's being worked on anymore, so I wouldn't expect anything to get improved. There's 3 card sets - Dark, Arcane, and War. They're pretty fun on their own, but when they're mixed together they don't work very well, you end up having to focus on half your starter deck while the other half feels like trash. The UI is okay but not good, biggest annoyances for me were selecting cards in large hands and finding a card to trash/upgrade in a large deck. The art is fine but it doesn't do a good job of making you feel like you're actually going anywhere due to the static background and the lack of anything happening outside of the cards. The unlocks for each class are linear (you have very few choices), but you get enough gold as you play to unlock everything pretty quick. Overall fun enough for a couple weeks' enjoyment, but once I beat it with the last couple decks I'll uninstall and not look back.

To look at something you have to stop, bring up the intelligence overlay, select the thing, and hold the inspect button. Annoying but not bad right? Except you have to do this dozens upon dozens of times to figure out what's around you and to gain experience. In order to unlock something the first time you it, you have to walk up to it, pick it up, and inspect it. This can be tricky because the game's icon system does a very poor job of guiding you to where the item actually is, especially in the trees. You can't spot anything while moving and you can only ""memorize"" the location of one thing at a time. So exploring a new area to find and interact with new things in order to learn about them is a massive pain in the ass. Then there's the annoying fear mechanic (overlay that makes it hard to see anything, and fear will eventually make you run home uncontrollably), and the fact that the game does not highlight or explain where you have to go to ""explore"" a new area to eliminate your fear. Plus the slow clunky movement, and the poorly explained tech tree and tribe functionality, and all I encountered in 3.5 hours was frustration with zero fun moments or events.

The tower and enemy variety are ok, crew management was a fun change of pace, the perks you unlock are interesting, there are super weapons that require a little planning to use well. The problem is none of it is exciting. Tower upgrades are linear so you don't really have much strategic choice, the first 10-15 minutes of nearly every mission feels the same, combat ends up feeling very repetitive because you kill the enemies before they get close enough to do anything.

Everything is static except the routes you build, and there are some restrictions on how you can build them. It's very simple and there's no progression. The game is solid but not exciting imo. There are 3 modes: 1 - Campaign where you have to move X people/goods in Y time. There's no penalties for people/goods waiting, nor for ignoring stations completely. 2 - Survival where you can't let more than X people/goods stack up at a station. Achievement is granted after 20 minutes (you can accelerate time up to 8x). I found this mode needlessly difficult to the point of frustration. 3 - Evacuation where you have to get X people/goods to an ""exit"" station in Y time. You only get exactly enough people to finish, so you have to empty all stations. There's also hard mode for Campaign and Evacuation, and ""Relaxation"" mode where you can just watch the game run itself if that's your thing. The major limitations to building are that tracks can only go one way, and you have no way of crossing perpendicular (no intersections or bridges allowed). Not realistic but works in the sense of it being a puzzle. Other than Survival mode I found the game to be decently fun. If you're looking for a simple train tracks timed puzzle then there's a lot of content here, but if you are hoping for things like financial simulation or town growth or realistic train behavior look elsewhere.",21.7 hrs on record,N/A

It is Early Access but the game is fully playable and I haven't seen any bugs (though there may be some), and the dev is active and communicative. Gameplay really captures the feeling of healing a party through a dungeon, with tons of upgrade options and lots of different ways to build your healer. Combat is boss fights only, and most have interesting mechanics that keep you on your toes watching for different things - buffs, debuffs, telegraphs to avoid, and other fun interactions. The loot codex that lets you search for text & jump to the fight with the loot you want is a really nice feature. I had to do a little farming to beat the final bosses (needed better gear & upgrade tokens) and the codex let me get right to it. Beating the main campaign will probably take most players 6-10 hours, then there's endless mode and trying different builds (there's loadout swap buttons to help with that).

Everything feels a little more polished, there's more fun scenarios to play, the tutorials have been improved, and a simple combat mechanic has been added. The devs just released (4/29) another major patch improving the UI and UX across the board. If you want a medium complexity base builder, I highly recommend this game. ------------------------ Original Early Access Review If you want a peaceful survival colony builder, then I 100% recommend this game. The game can be fully enjoyed as-is, and Early Access is being handled well. The devs are quite active - fixing bugs, adding features, communicating with the community. There's no enemies so survival is the only source of challenge. You have to build carefully to balance growth versus meeting your survivors' needs (food, water, health, and happiness).  The atmosphere is really good, gives a nice postapocalyptic feel, especially with the radiation concerns. I really enjoyed the expedition mechanic. You can send small parties off to explore ruins to gain resources and bonuses. Some benefit from sending survivors with certain skills. Some have minor scripted events. You will hit a point where there's nothing new to do in a city after 10-20 hours depending on how you play. Restarting can feel pretty linear, you know the build order and techs you need. I am hopeful that this will improve as the devs work on the game, but currently if you want to make only 1 city and keep growing it forever this is definitely a drawback. Scenarios are the main replay value right now, their tweaked requirements help change things up. I've only tried 2, the seed race did not do anything new but the drought one definitely pushed me to approach things differently which I enjoyed a lot. I plan to try another scenario soon, which will be my 4th city - that should tell you how much I'm enjoying the game :) I'm looking forward to the continued development, but even in its current state it's a fun play.

Problem descriptions and the solutions manual are often cryptic, requiring you to flip through much of the manual to figure out what actually needs to happen.

76561197992783558,17,Pixel Heroes: Byte & Magic,"Adventure, Indie, RPG",Recommended,"A game ruined by bad mechanics and cheap deaths. Everything in the game is stat based. Some classes get 5 points in some stats per level, some classes max at 3. That means some classes are flat out 40% worse than others, without anything to make up for this. Most output is based on one stat. Classes that expect you to split points between two stats are splitting their output, again without anything to make up for this. You have to bring a healer. You only get 3 group slots so your freedom of choice is immediately reduced. At the start you have to pick from 6 random classes, with 5 rerolls. As you play you unlock more and more garbage classes, which will make this limitation even more infuriating. There is no reason to prevent the player from choosing classes directly. Status effects will wreck you. Finding gear that makes you immune to the worst ones is critical - and entirely luck based. Getting hit with multiple at once will easily kill a high health character in one turn. When a character dies, if you're not about to beat the dungeon boss, you're done. There is no way you will beat a full health boss with 2 or fewer characters, even though the game will drag things out by making you fight on. You can be winning every fight handily and then suddenly encounter a fight where you're on the brink of death in the first 2 rounds. This can happen in your first dungeon or your 8th, regardless of how well you've prepared. Constantly upgrading your gear is critical, but it is common to go entire dungeons & shop resets while only seeing 3-4 upgrades - and you've got 15 slots to fill. Randomness can be fun, but not when it constantly causes failures outside your control. This game leans heavily into the latter category.",14.7 hrs on record,N/A

Thermometer senses temperature significantly down and to the right of its aim reticle, and it resets to 0 if its invisible sweet spot falls off your ingot. Tongs intermittently fail to pick up for no discernible reason which is especially bad since you have to get your ingot out of the fire before it overheats. Hammering your ingot you have to hit specific spots with no visual marker, and if you hit one spot too much you ruin your craft. You constantly have to lug your ingot back and forth between the forge, which is made much worse by the awful keybinds and frustrating thermometer and tongs.

Making money was too easy, and there was no reason not to only sell the most expensive stuff. You'll get a penalty if you only sell 2 or 3 items, but up that to 5 or 6 and you won't have problems. Expanding the shop didn't feel necessary since I was unable to generate enough visitors per day to take advantage of the extra stock. The world was interesting but simple. The penalties for helping out one clan made it feel not worthwhile. Leveling up the factions that want you to ship them stuff was difficult only because the items were random and some took too long to craft. Co op works fine once you're able to connect. Tip - if your friend can't join your game (sits at connecting, then drops to menu) have the host recreate the game. Usually after 1 or 2 tries it'll fix itself. This only happened to me twice out of about 12 times playing. Fans of the first game may notice that all of the shopkeeping elements are dumbed down. Some are nice (better zapper and bot automation) but if you were hoping for a more intricate economy or anything like that, you'll be disappointed. There's a bit of a main quest, but the finish is drawn out by a guy that will only let you do 1 step per day, and then it ends abruptly.

Can't save mid combat, too easy to lose fighters to minor mistakes or enemies spawning on you. Can only heal a portion of damage taken, making long range weapons king, while short/medium ranged items and tech felt pointless. - Final mission pits you against many enemies with super high damage ranged weapons for the first time in the entire game. My squad that was absolutely breezing through other fights required massive retooling which took a ton of time. - Time sinks. Research, leveling up fighters, looting needed materials, healing up after fights, traversing the world map, all took way too long. - Other towns constantly demand ridiculous tributes even when friendly. Completely outweighs any benefits of maintaining contact. I had to destroy the couple I had relations with, and just avoided the rest.

The main draw here by far is the joy of seeing dinosaurs stomping around. If that won't carry the day for you, skip it. The building UI works but could use a quality of life pass. It can be real finicky about where you can or cannot place buildings. Laying fences, gyro tracks, monorails, and power lines is a pain in the ass because you have to manually switch back and forth between the build tool and the bulldozer tool for every mistake. A ""planning"" tool would be nice - drop a bunch of stuff but don't build it til you hit okay. The management system is simple to the point of being boring. Making money is braindead easy, research and expeditions are merely click what you want and wait. You do get to make some minor decisions about how juiced up you want your dinos. The story is fine, nothing exciting but has a nice JP feel and gives you decent goals to pursue. As you do stuff you unlock bite-sized text snippets of dino info and movie lore, which I liked. There's a good chunk of voice acting from Goldbloom too which is always a plus. The interaction UI is the worst thing about this game due to one very bad ""feature"". Every time you click a building it automatically zooms in on it, and it doesn't reset the zoom/view when you're done. The dinos look good and it's fun seeing them going about their activities, including when they break out. Storm events are annoying but not too impactful. Guests kinda just appear where attractions are, despite there being monorails that pretend to bring them into and transport them about the park. In the end I mainly enjoyed playing because the dinosaurs were tons of fun.

The environments aren't interesting enough to make repeat plays vs villains feel different in any way.

The animations for working in buildings, swimming, gathering, construction, etc. are all very nicely done and help the world feel alive. The world itself does a great job embodying a post-apocalyptic flood. Meeting everyone's needs is the core challenge of the game, and it does a good job of pushing you to explore and research and expand. My two main complaints are that there's no sustainable way to generate goods and clean food, and that the tech tree could use a little more guidance - i.e. the tree itself should make it clear what buildings need electricity to function, and that the symbol by certain techs means you need a specialist.

There's too much walking, walking is too slow, and walking directions don't align with paths so you have to constantly correct your direction. Edit: ""World orientation"" does align movement with paths, but it makes W,A,S,D move you diagonally, which is disorienting enough to be unusable for me. Ideally A+S together (for example) would move you down+left, not A alone. Many progression blocking recipes are completed by turning in random amounts of goods to random people, with no way to track who needs what. Edit: You can see what people will trade for recipes by clicking on them on the map. It would be nicer to see this info in the recipe list instead of having to click through everyone whenever I want to see if I can unlock something. This is a much smaller issue than my initial description. There are too many recipes that ask for inputs you can't get/make yet without warning you. The shop cycle is exactly the same no matter what you're selling. Automation isn't interesting - input and output happens with no layout or supply line planning needed. Workers' wages level up faster than you can unlock goods to support them, so their skill points just sit unused. I just never hit a point in the game where I felt like i was rewarded for what I was doing. Plot snippets and uninteresting shop upgrades were not fun enough to justify the frustration of constantly being fed more recipes requiring more tedious wandering to source up the necessary inputs.

Okay with AI partner, better with friends. More of a play once in a while game rather than one to play obsessively over and over. Pros: - 5 very different characters with fun abilities - Fun gameplay loop that rewards you for mixing up your abilities - Interesting enemies that don't feel unfair - Single playthrough 30-60 mins so you're not locked into a super long run - Co-op works well, great with friends - Fun perk choices when you level Cons: - A single victory playthrough will show you everything in the game - Maps don't feel that random because the same tasks are required in the same order - When leveling, not enough perk variety to keep things feeling fresh after many runs - Controls have issues (WASD mode dodge roll moves towards mouse, mouse mode leftclick moves but rightclick moves AND attacks) - Unlocks take a very long time to earn (only important for harder difficulties) Despite its flaws I had a ton of fun playing. The gameplay loop itself is super fun, with really entertaining abilities and combat and perk choices. There's not a ton of co-op games like this (reminds me of bloodsports.tv), so getting to play this with my friends is a huge plus. Trying different classes will give me another 10-20 hours of replay value minimum. If you can look past the low map variety and grindy unlocks, this game is a great value and lots of fun with friends and you really should check it out. Edit: After a second night, 2 new thoughts 1) Netlag/performance was a problem. Switched to peer-to-peer and that helped, but the game chugs sometimes still. Restarting the game after every play seemed like it helped. Definitely something that devs need to troubleshoot. 2) First harder difficulty was a major step up. Was daunting at first but tons of fun once we got used to it. Will definitely extend the replay value a bit, but still not a ton due to the low variety flaws noted above.",26.1 hrs on record																					(4.3 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197992783558,19,Remnant: From the Ashes,"Action, Adventure, RPG",Recommended,"This game has some serious problems, enough that I do not find it worth playing. It's buggy - untargetable enemies under the floor will kill you, flying enemies will clip into bridges/etc. and will shoot you while you can't hit them. In a game where a few hits will kill you, taking damage from bugged out enemies you can't hit is unacceptable. Its combat is poorly designed. Enemies will charge at you while out of line of sight and their charges will wrap around 90 degree angle corners. Melee swings will hit you even when you're on the other side of pillars. Bosses will enter their phases inconsistently - a boss that summons allies at 80% health one run and 40% the next can be either very hard or relatively easy based on pure luck. The main combat loop is extremely boring. The enemies felt very samey, mainly because they all require the same approach. Most of the bosses I fought had the same problem - keep your distance, plink away at the health bar, definitive bullet sponges. Level design felt like 3 areas on copy/paste, without the minimap I would have thought I'd gone in circles. Character abilities were simple, not requiring timing, aiming, or thinking. Character progression is terrible as well. Weapons unlock slowly and are basic standard gun types. Everything upgrades in zero-effort linear fashion - leveled up stats and weapons simply improve incrementally. Enemies level to match your highest gear so you get punished if you try to specialize. The game offers zero interesting decisions. Add to that the basic problems with souls-like and third person combat -- focusing on dodge timing is your only combat option, your character blocks your view in tight hallways, bullets hit object corners that your aim reticle looks clear around, etc. -- and I found the frustrations to far outweigh any entertainment value. The game is a bunch of poorly built parts cobbled into a fumbling whole. I don't understand the positive reception it has received.",5.0 hrs on record,N/A

You build infrastructure, produce and sell goods, unlock new stuff, and repeat. It was fun learning the systems and figuring out how to properly set things up. The campaign was functional, setting simple goals that required you to unlock tech and make sure your workshop is efficient. There was a lot of down time, waiting for goods to be produced. The game could have used a higher fast forward speed or production times should have been shorter. Due to this the game is more enjoyable when you're watching something in the background. This is especially true for the level 40 workshop achievement, the last 6 or 7 hours of my gameplay were spent doing that. I encountered a couple of bugs but they were all fixed by saving and reloading. The worst was delivery trucks getting stuck in the loading bays, the rest were just visual information that got stuck on screen. I don't consider these major issues since they didn't break my game and they went away after a quick save/load. Very highly recommended if you want a casual goods production game.

The supply chain systems ramp up nicely, starting from very basic but getting more and more complex as you unlock new tiers of technology. As you unlock new material needs, you may find that you didn't allocate enough space to keep everything adjacent, so prepare yourself for that - either embrace inefficient layout or be prepared to clear various work areas and redeploy them. The only driving force in the game is to generate more advanced goods to keep unlocking new tech, so if you need conflict or pressure or consequences to enjoy games then you might want to skip this one.

If you need complex systems or a huge world or randomized events to keep you going, this one is not for you. But if you're interested in something simpler or more casual (relatively speaking), then I strongly recommend this game. It has all the basics you'd want, a sense of technology changing your city, balancing population growth with meeting your needs, defending against hostiles. None of it has much depth - the tech tree is pretty limited, your city only changes so much, you're very limited in the area of the world you get to interact with, there's not other tribes to build relations with, there's no events that require any creative thought. But that's okay, sometimes I just want to enjoy building up a settlement/society without necessarily having to churn my gears too much.

76561197992783558,20,Rise of Industry,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"I'd give this one a sideways thumb if I could. If you're a big fan of the genre and you don't mind a problematic UI, then go for it, otherwise consider carefully before purchasing. Early game's biggest problem is that the game expects you to remember every single thing you were shown in the tutorial, which sends them at you pretty rapid fire. There's lots of mechanics or displays that aren't obvious but are explained in the tutorial. I had a few moments of frustration related to that. Also the campaign objectives will push you to make decisions that will tank your company, do not try to complete new ones immediately when they show up. Mid game some flaws start to show through. The building input/output lists are too small, especially for warehouses - being only able to see 3 things at once is very limiting. You can't see a list of all your buildings shipping to a place. There's no quick way to adjust many outputs at once. If you screw up a route (bad road, bad rails) it is VERY hard to find where the problem is - the problem route won't highlight when you mouse over it, and sometimes (as far as I can tell) you get the message for no reason and it goes away on its own after a few minutes, maybe because there's too much traffic or not enough trucks? The fact that I don't know just shows how the game UI really doesn't help you out if you have problems. Late game, all the mid game problems get compounded. You have tons of buildings to manage and no central way to manage them. Being able to only see 3 input/output slots at a time in the building UI becomes a massive problem, same with only being able to change one route at a time. And the lack of information on what is causing pathing errors becomes all the more frustrating as you have more routes and more ground to cover. If you buy another corporation and don't scrap everything they own, you end up with dozens of buildings that have overlapping names with your existing buildings. The UI will show you the location of a building but it's still annoying to think well which ""Warehouse 4"" are we talking about again? And if the pathing breaks, it covers up the city info, so you actually have no idea which duplicately named target building is the problem. The UI does some things really well though, like let you quickly map your routes and give you good info when storage is full - you can jump directly to the problem with one click. The ability to copy and paste buildings is very helpful, and the overlays are really nice. And most importantly the base gameplay is fun. I enjoyed putting together the various supply lines, the campaign quest gave me satisfying goals to shoot once I stopped rushing them, and I liked how towns grew based on the flow of goods. So overall a good game with some UI flaws that start minor but grow much worse as your company grows. There is replay value in trying out different supply line combinations or playing sandbox or scenarios, but I'll be retiring the game after one playthrough due to the various frustrations.",31.9 hrs on record																					(31.4 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197992783558,20,Scrap Mechanic,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Simulation, Early Access",Recommended,"General advice: This is an early access open world survival/crafting game. If you're unfamiliar with the genre, these types of games are notorious for spending years in early access only to end up abandoned or pushed out as ""1.0"" unfinished. You should treat the current state of the game as the full product you're buying and don't pin your hopes on future potential. Only recommended if you want to play around with a powerful and complex system of automation including controllers, logic switches, etc. Very good if that's what you're interested in, but as far as actual gameplay goes I found it frustrating, repetitive, buggy, and poorly paced. Early game doesn't explain that you have to find a building in order to unlock the full set of construction options. Tip: don't set up a long term base at your landing point. Mid game expects you to farm a lot of crops to unlock defensive guns but farming spawns enemy waves which are a pain in the ass without guns. You also have to gather underwater materials which is tedious, time consuming, and un-automatable. Late game has big buildings with enemies that kill you in two shots and force you to restart all the way outside, requires you to use a free-energy kludge pistons to travel the distances required or spend IRL hours farming fuel for gas engines, and finding a mandatory rare resource trapped farmers anywhere near you is completely luck of the draw. And once you've got all that covered there's nothing new to see or do. Bugs range from annoyances like losing loot through the ground or animals somehow escaping completely walled in enclosures, to progression-halters like multiple enemy waves per day instead of 1 or being unable to turn in the rare resource mentioned above. Performance is good except rare cases that are acceptable for an in-development game, seems to be related to a lot of loose objects stacked onto eachother, enemy AI pathing issues, and something when loading into the big end-game buildings. For some people the crafting system will be enjoyable enough to carry the day. But if you want an actual game beyond that you should wait and see if things improve.",30.8 hrs on record,N/A

Overall a very disappointing game. Combat lacks the impactful feeling of the original games because you're so zoomed out and the animations are so sloppy (warping you to enemies, not syncing right with enemy movements, etc). Outside bosses, combat primarily consists of mashing the execute button and being stuck in the same uninterruptible animation over and over. Ability power is doled out sparingly, which is surprising given that abilities are not really that powerful. This contributes to the feeling of combat monotony. The limited combat variety was not a problem in the originals because you only fought a few enemies, fighting against hordes gets repetitive and boring super fast. The camera is really bad. Lots of times you're fighting as shadows behind giant objects. Puzzles are unnecessarily frustrating due to bad camera angles. Finding collectibles is a pain in the ass because it's unnecessarily hard to see where you're going.

76561197992783558,21,Golem Gates,Strategy,Recommended,"This is more of a sideways thumb. I didn't enjoy the game, but it's well constructed with solid mechanics, and I think some people may enjoy it if they don't share my dislike of the core gameplay. It's definitely not a bad game and doesn't deserve a thumbs down. I liked the summoning mechanic, you draw new cards (abilities/units/buildings) slowly, you accumulate power to cast them slowly, and there is a maximum power capacity that grows over time. I liked the balance of the pace of card drawing + power generation, I didn't feel overwhelmed managing cards/casting vs combat but the card/power pace didn't bog the game down either. How much power a card costs is a constant concern, both in play and in deck building. The deck building was fun, I found there to be lots of good options and important considerations. I earned new cards at a decent pace, and there's a forge where you can buy a variety of different cards every day, both of which kept things feeling fresh and interesting. The game looks nice and the UI is solid. Even if you don't want to play PvP (like me) there's still a ton of content between the campaign, trials, and survival mode. My biggest problem is that I did not enjoy the RTS play, aka the core of the game. I found unit pathing to be an annoying mess of collisions and rerouting. I found it difficult to differentiate most of my units during combat (icons + unit models were too similar and all clumped together, everything is shiny and one color). The campaign was way too easy with no difficulty option, and while cut scenes were skippable the level intros were not (usually 15 seconds - 1 minute) which turned me off of trying to replay levels to get any achievements I missed. The trials seemed to have a more decent difficulty balance but since I didn't enjoy the core combat I only played 5 of them. I didn't have enough interest to try survival. There was a lot I liked about this game, but ultimately I didn't enjoy the actual gameplay.

76561197992783558,21,HYPERNOVA: Escape from Hadea,"Action, Strategy",Recommended,"Solid tower defense with some fun concepts. The world is one big map that you progress through, and you can move your buildings around to respond to your changing needs. If you want a traditional tower defense you might not like this, but I found it to be a fun challenge and a refreshing change of pace from normal TD tower placement + maze management tropes. The game is actually more like a base building game with towers - you build civilian buildings to increase your population to unlock tech, support buildings to clear new building area and provide power and provide prereqs for other buildings, harvester buildings to gather resources, and towers to keep the bad guys out. The big map concept is managed well, you're pretty free to expand but you have to manage the enemy threat. It did feel overwhelming at first but once I got the hang of it, I felt like I always had a path to pursue and was generally able to manage the threat despite its source coming from different areas. Being able to move my buildings to new spots to as needed really fit in well with this concept. I enjoyed the feeling of expanding into this dangerous world via careful building placement. I did have a few minor annoyances. There was a stealth enemy type I never figured out how to kill, and sometimes they'd take out supply line elements at range. Building repairers have to be unlocked via tech, and their autorepair didn't work well for me so I had to frequently trigger it manually. I got stuck on one quest for a couple hours, and the game did something at the end that I didn't like though it didn't ruin the ending or anything like that. A couple of spoiler-y hints for those last two (feel free to skip) - Quest: When the game asks you to trap units for study, focus on that. I spent a couple hours finishing that up after I had my map on lockdown. End of game: As the game progresses you can move your defenses to focus on whatever lair is out there. When you trigger the end mission they send massive waves at you where you have to defend your core buildings especially your main base. So before you finish building the Big Final Thing, build or relocate defenses to your main base. I felt like the game didn't give me sufficient warning about this sudden change in strategy requirement. Over all a fun and interesting game if you want something with towers that isn't your traditional tower defense, especially if you like base building games.

76561197992783558,21,Moonlighter,"Action, Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"A decent game in a the very under-served hybrid shopkeeper genre. Combat is good, rpg elements are ok, shopkeeping elements are not good, and the UI is really really bad with zero mouse support. If you're interested give it a shot, but don't expect to be blown away by any phase of the game. Combat is solid, dodge roll plus two attack types per weapon plus quick swap between 2 weapons. Different weapons provide interesting options but get expensive to craft so make sure you try out the base weapons early to figure out which ones fit your style. Enemy variety and design is quite good. Some people complain that it is too easy, I'm generally bad at this type of combat and found the middle difficulty a very good challenge, take that as you will. The RPG elements in the game are based around earning money and buying upgrades. It's all pretty linear but it's functional, providing goals for the player and giving a sense of growth. The town's population may change a little, but no one ever has anything interesting to say. You don't get quests or build relationships with shoppers or other NPCs or anything like that (the super generic shopper requests don't count). Shopkeeping is very meh. The figure-out-the-price mechanic is a pain in the ass, especially with the terrible UI, I recommend using a guide for prices. The market doesn't fluctuate and since entering prices is such a pain in the ass (see a theme here?) it's not worth trying to change prices to match high/low demand or specialty buyers. And the UI. Ugh. For a game where inventory management and item tracking play such a big part, the UI is absolutely painful. During dungeon crawling, to trash items you have to manually pick up and move each item stack. And you have to do this A LOT. The lack of a single button trash command is unforgivable. In the shop, you're supposed to figure out your starting price for an item by looking at a book listing all the items and price ranges. But you can't pull that book out when placing an item, and finding the item in the book takes way too much work. Setting and adjusting prices works by changing each individual numerical digit via up/down. Every interaction with the shop backend is a colossal waste of time. I recommend using a price guide to avoid this nightmare. The lack of mouse support is very disappointing. I don't mean it didn't detect my thumb buttons, I mean you can't use your mouse. Period. All that item moving around has to be done via keypress or thumbstick. Every time you have to select an item on the left and then change a price on the right, you have to move the cursor there instead of just quickly swiping over. I get that it probably saved a lot of development work, but as a player it makes every inventory interaction 10x worse. Super frustrating. But really there's not a lot of shopkeeper games out there, especially hybrid ones. The combat is good, the graphics are good, the RPG elements are fine. If this was just a shop game, the UI would be unforgivable. In a game that covers so many bases at once, it's hard to get everything right. It's unfortunate that the UI is such a nightmare but everything else is fun enough that it's worth pushing through.

Combination of hero units, Kingdom Rush unit huts, and standard towers. Fun variety of enemies and towers and heroes, lots of missions, plenty of stuff to unlock as you progress.

But this didn't hamper my enjoyment of the game. A few hints (no spoilers) - - There's a second flag for challenge mode in each mission (along the top in mission select). - Heroes level up by killing stuff. If you want to level up your guys, pick a map + difficulty where you can funnel enemies to your heroes.

Otherwise you'll find that the games systems are squandered in gameplay that you don't enjoy. *** Sandbox *** Winning maps requires micromanaging units in combat with an extremely heavy focus on kiting. This means lots of clicking, and your cool towers and turrets end up feeling disappointingly weak. Pathfinding is buggy, sometimes units go totally the wrong way for no reason, and they constantly get stuck on other units or minor obstacles. Units sometimes will just forget or ignore a command. All this compounds the frustration involved in the combat clickfest. Other people have covered the problem with the Mutants better than I could, just search it up. It's definitely a problem that hurts the quality of sandbox play. *** Campaign *** In the campaign, only 50% of the missions (25) are sandboxy, you know the game mode that gained the game all its attention. The other 25 are 10 hero missions and 15 swarm missions. They are terrible. The sandbox missions are fine, but they're not that different, and it feels like there are so many missions just to pad players' play times. They get repetitive very quickly. Swarm missions are unfun tedium. You have a set amount of points, you get to drop units and simple defenses, no town building or exploring or resource gathering or progression. You plop your guys down and hope you win. You can micro-kite to improve your K:D efficiency, but that's it. Oh and there's no speed up button so once you've got things under control and the last few enemies are trickling in, you might as well go afk for a bit - this problem is especially bad if you think you'll skip these annoying missions by dropping the difficulty setting. Hero missions are the worst. You have to search every pixel to find hidden objects, otherwise you miss out on crucial research and points to spend in the swarm missions. Dropping difficulty to easy doesn't help because you still have to find everything, and again there's no speed up button so you're limited by your hero's walk rate. Items are randomly placed, they can be a tiny goblet in the shadows between 2 bunks or behind a barrel, they can be the same exact barrel icon as every single other barrel so you have to mouse over every single barrel in the map. It is a tedious pointless disrespectful waste of the players' time. Not to mention the fact that heroes have no interesting abilities, so combat consists of shooting things, backing up, and shooting them some more. Completely boring and uninteresting. The campaign tech tree is another exercise in screwing over players. There's no way to respec, and you have lots of different paths to choose from, so if you don't read a strategy guide and pick the absolutely crucial techs for your first 5 or 6 (better rush farms!), or you pick some of the options that sound really good early but turn out to be totally worthless later, you can find yourself dozens of hours into the game and struggling to complete certain missions for no reason other than the fact that you're trapped in your tech choices. Then there's the lack of in-mission saves. One small mistake can lead to a cascading horde as your buildings get infected. A fun mechanic in standalone maps, not so much in a campaign where you have persistent punishment for failure, especially when the game does a terrible job of letting you know when 1 lone zombie has snuck past your patrols or walls. A solo zombie can take out a building in about 5 seconds, leading to a chain reaction map failure if you don't notice before you get the completely useless too-late ""you're under attack"" warning. Forced ironman mode doesn't make sense when maps take so long to finish and cheap losses abound. *** Overall the game has fantastic concepts and art, with sandbox combat that has disappointing bugs and focuses on click-heavy micromanagement which not everyone will enjoy, and a campaign so bad it should be completely avoided. There's just too much bad layered on top to recommend this game to anyone except the most hardcore clickfest enthusiast.",47.8 hrs on record,N/A

Skip this one. Sometimes my game would crash when leaving the main town. Usually that could be fixed by positioning myself differently when leaving. When entering the dungeon from the surface, my game crashed about 80% of the time, to the point where I felt like I shouldn't leave. Super frustrating. The main quest did not recognize that I had opened the first dungeon door even though I followed the quest instructions exactly, and thus I could not continue with the rest of the quest. At that point it was no longer worth continuing to play. The game systems were generally ok but felt slow. Combat was fine against small groups but the game insisted on throwing big groups at me, which became quite tedious. Mining felt slower than it needed to be, same with walk speed. There was a little bit of progression in a very limited set of quests, loot, and abilities that was enjoyable but not exciting. I would have tentatively recommended the game if not for the crashes and the unforgivable broken main quest. I leave this game wishing I could get the time back that I spent playing it.

76561197992783558,22,Geo,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation",Recommended,"The game has interesting mechanics and a lot of varying upgrades to unlock, but progression requires a TON of grinding. I only recommend this game if you have a very high tolerance for repetition, or if you're looking for something chill to play while doing something else (listening to podcasts, watching documentaries, etc). The core gameplay is simple but decently fun, you steer a little drill around focusing on ""softer"" blocks and bonus blocks, avoiding monsters, trying to mine the core of the planet/moon/etc. You can get upgrades via medals, via hiring folks, using core bits, building rooms, upgrading your hired folks, improving your company's reputation, etc. The problem is that in order to gather the money and materials needed, you'll have to replay levels you've already seen dozens upon dozens of times. Given that the gameplay is pretty simple and the general approach to a map doesn't really change from run to run, replaying them feels quite unrewarding. I'd say about 75% of my time has been spent just replaying levels I'm already bored with and I have either already beaten or I have zero chance of beating until I unlock something new. I've only advanced to division 7 (you start at 10) and I've only unlocked maybe 20% of the available upgrades, and I'm about ready to quit. So why am I giving the game a thumbs up? The game is well crafted, and a lot of the systems are amusing and/or fun. I can recommend it to anyone who thinks the grind doesn't sound like a bad thing - just be warned, I came in aware that the game is known for being grindy, and even then I was overwhelmed.",22.7 hrs on record																					(14.8 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197992783558,22,Mindustry,Strategy,Recommended,"Great game with a couple notable flaws. As long as you can power through the slow start, I very strongly recommend this game to anyone who is interested. My 2 big complaints: 1) The start is very slow and boring. The first 5 levels felt like zero challenge, you haven't unlocked much tech so there really isn't anything interesting to build, and it takes a good chunk of time to grind out the needed achievements to unlock the later levels. 2) The game really needs to tell you in-level what unlocks are possible. It's annoying to finish an easy level (or a hard level where you're doing well) to realize that you needed to run another 10 or 20 waves to unlock something, so then you have to go back and do it again. Once you get past the start it really picks up. Better difficulty and variety of enemies, lots of tech unlocks add new things to think about, more resource types require more infrastructure planning and building, it becomes challenging to build things fast enough to keep up with the constant pressure from waves. Levels allow you to unlock the ability to bring more resources at the start, which means you can jump into replaying a level ready to build much quicker, to farm up those fancier resources you need for higher tech unlocks and stock up for bringing to other levels. The pace is nice and fast too. Factorio was fantastic because you had this huge map with this massive end goal and everything ramps up together without having to restart. Mindustry is great because you jump into a level and the pressure is on to build and defend right away, and maps usually wrap up in 45-90 minutes depending on what wave you want to play until. Oh and co-op works really well! About 90% of my time is in co-op and it's worked very smoothly. There is an occasional display bug where my partner sees wrong resources in a conveyor that aren't there for me (the host), and maybe twice we've had power nodes bug out which was fixed by replacing them. Other than that a very good co-op experience, easy to send invites and have a friend join.

I really liked all the ski lift levels, it was fun playing constructor with a different approach. I was back and forth on the ramp levels (jumps, bikes, snowmobiles, tow lines etc) at first, they weren't as fun but they were not unfun. The problem is they're all the same, building longer and longer ramps using bridge physics, none of the interesting different approach like in the lift levels. I'm just going to skip the rest of them. That being said, there's over 100 levels and around half are ramps, so even if you don't like them there's plenty of content to play. And if you love bridge constructor stuff, the ramps will probably be enjoyable.

76561197992783558,22,Galaxy Squad,Strategy,Recommended,"Like a nice simple mix of X-COM and FTL. Not perfectly balanced and a little easy, but fun combat and overall a very nice game for a very fair price. You go from star to star having random encounters (mostly combat) while an invincible fleet closes out the galaxy behind you. The combat is very X-COM, turn based with abilities and cover and hit chance, enemies generally don't start acting until you get in their sight radius. I found the hardest difficulty to be pretty easy, and I imagine turn based veterans will find it the same. Combat is very fun, with a fantastic variety of enemies and a good variety of victory conditions. The player unit classes and abilities are fun to use as well, although some class/ship abilities are so good they seem almost mandatory. There's some replay value from the branching story, and unlocking more gear, classes, game modes, etc. It probably took me 40 hours to finish all the story variants and try all the game modes. If you use a guide or rush you could definitely get there faster than that. If you want an enjoyable fast-playing X-COM clone with a galaxy progression similar to FTL, and you don't mind the fact that it may not be very challenging, then I completely recommend this game at full price.

In 9 hours I got all the achievements, did all quests, and conquered the map. The last hour or two were spent grinding out the cash for the last achievement. It's a shortish game with no real reason to replay it. Building up the islands you conquer is very simple, there's only a handful of buildings with no real decisions to be made. Combat is similarly simple, and almost entirely based on the size of your ship and crew. I enjoyed the quests and the general positive message of the game, and the laid back pace. However I wish it had been more challenging in some way, at least requiring some strategic choices or something like that. If you want a leisurely and pleasant pirate cruise with minimal decision making, then this might be worth a look.

76561197992783558,23,Fictorum,"Action, Indie, RPG",Recommended,"A super fun spell system, you really get to feel like an amazing powerful mage, but it takes a lot of time per run to farm up good spells which will feel repetitive for some people. Highly recommended on sale, at full price only recommended if you're confident that the joy of the mage will outweigh the repetition for you. The biggest flaw is the variety of the normal game mode imo. It can be tough to find the spells and gear you need, so you'll need to hit every map you can before advancing chapters, which usually ends up taking around 60-80 maps. This exposes the limited amount of maps, events, and enemies. It can get to feeling repetitive if you're not in love with the spell system. But what a spell system! 20+ mods, 3 mods per spell, and they can combo in ridiculous ways. My latest run I tinkered with giant AE lightning bomb traps, spread-firing lightning beam gunner orb followers, shotgunning masses of ball lightning, and spread-firing chain-casting rapid-fire lightning whips. I really felt like a badass mage mowing through armies of enemies. I did enjoy blowing up buildings, but it's not so much the focus of the game. Most building destruction is either collateral damage or purely perfunctory - get loot, eliminate guard towers, or unlock the exit. Blasting a bridge full of baddies is still absolutely glorious (but rare), and the rest of it starts to feel routine albeit still pretty damn cool. A couple of tips for the new player: - Use your Clairvoyance key! It will reveal your enemies, and show you all the house loot which is especially helpful for potions. - The final boss is hard in a way no other fight is. You should try to be broken strong by the time you reach it. Personally I love combat/skill systems I can really mess around with, and this game's spell+mod system is right up my alley. As a result this is a game that I completely love despite its flaws. If that sounds like you, I heartily recommend this game.

At 2-ish hours to beat and about 1.5 more hours to 100%, this really is a short one. You run a train that you load up with guns, some controlled by the player some AI towers. You shoot at well designed ground an air enemies and enemy towers. Map design was decently varied. I loved the concept and the gameplay in general. There were some flaws though. The mouse aim had a tendency to skip if I moved my aim quickly, especially if speed boosting. The first boss fight was a little frustrating, felt like I had to grind early levels too much for cash. The biggest problem I had is the length. Now the game is only $4 and I had a ton of fun playing it. But if you just play the game start to finish, there's only like 2 hours of content here. In about 3 hours I ran every level at least twice, got every mail collectible, and got every achievement. I could probably spend half an hour finishing every optional objective, but I found some too frustrating to bother with. And there's no real reason to replay outside of that.

There are two types of enemies that attack periodically, vikings and dragons. They put enough pressure on you to keep your city defended, but once you get the hang of how they operate they're easy to fend off. There's a fun but small variety of buildings, and keeping your city happy, fed, and not broke is a fun challenge at first. Once you get the hang of things it becomes simple to replicate the needed pattern for continuous growth. If I wasn't a completionist I probably would have stopped after about 25 hours, when I got the 2k population achievement. After that there wasn't anything new, just pushing out my defended territory so I had enough space to support 5k population (tip: around 3.5k your population growth will balance out with death rate, you need to use town squares to throw festivals to grow after that). All things considered, this game is a solid value at $10 and an excellent value on sale.

Most notably the assignment progression system is terrible. To unlock more mission types, base features, new guns, etc., you have to complete a set of 3-6 specific mission types in sequence. That unlock pace is plenty slow and repetitive, but if you're playing with friends you'll be held back by needing different missions that rarely overlap. Padding the grind is really unnecessary, especially when the base guns are so dull and the base mission types are so limited. Pretty odd for a team based game to punish you so hard for playing with your friends. There other flaws as well - being blind while mining sucks, it's impossible to see teammates' markers if you're close to them, the map is too small and way too slow to open, enemy variety is limited, etc. On my post-EA go-round I got terminally bored with it after another 15-ish missions.

Poor design decisions and poor PC support derail an otherwise interesting game. Lack of mouse reticle makes Sniper and Engineer unusable with m+k, can't tell where mouse is relative to character, meaning it's hard to control aim speed and easy to accidentally flip due to going across character. Lack of sensitivity option makes Sniper unusable if you're bad with controllers. In a game where 3/4 characters have limited range, every character has multiple knockbacks that send enemies flying in unpredictable directions. In co-op the frustration of chasing bouncing enemies is endless. A couple of bosses have cheap deaths, especially Charon's doom mechanic requiring frame-precise timing to avoid, as someone who doesn't enjoy souls-like games this was extremely frustrating and did not mesh well with the rest of the game's playstyle. To get the ""real"" ending you have to either use a guide to find all the stones as you go, or do an insane amount of backtracking, both of which kind of suck the joy out of the game. Gear upgrades do not tell you what they do so either you have to go online and look or sacrifice a chunk of cash just to find out. Passive tree locks buffs behind other buffs that are not compatible. For example on engineer if you're focusing weapon damage, you have to spend large chunks of cash unlocking tech buffs that do nothing for you in order to unlock important high tier buffs for weapon damage. There is a level where you have to fight many enemies while the screen is waving in an awful nauseating manner, I never get motion sickness during games and I had to take a break in the middle of this level.

If you like base-builders and are looking something short form, you should get this game. As a big fan of games like RimWorld, this game exemplifies the best qualities of that genre while distilling it down to a very quick (few hours long) playthrough. That requires a bit of shallowness to all the various phases of the game, but really that's the only way you could get a basebuilder that takes such a short amount of time to play. You have to build up your base of followers, ensuring there's enough food and defenses to outlast the waves of enemies that come at night and from the enemy spawn points. Build up your army and venture out during the day to pick up important supplies and loot, and to take down the enemy spawns. Wrap the whole thing up with a big boss fight. Everything is tightly balanced around the small world and quicker playthrough. The rate of follower arrival, the number of buildings required, the short distances to explore, etc. The UI took a little learning but is surprisingly efficient and well designed.

The game occasionally crashed for me but I was still able to finish it without major problems. The writing/humor won't appeal to everyone, but the dice + cards mechanic is surprisingly fun given the limited level/board size. If it sounds interesting, I recommend you give it a look, especially on sale. The deck design provides a decent amount of choice and options. Cards earn a little slowly at first but soon enough you accumulate enough currency to buy what you want. A minor complaint is that you can't use cards across multiple characters. Having to pick up extra copies just to outfit secondary decks was mildly annoying. There's a few different victory conditions and the levels/boards, while very small, are randomized a bit, so there's a decent enough variety to keep things from getting too repetitive. The boss mechanic was fun although I would have liked to see a little more variety there. I experienced a crash with the tornado card, but by not using the spell on the same spot where it crashed before I was able to work around it. Other people are experiencing different crashes (which I did not see) so you may want to check the forum to see how much that worries you. The various characters' bonus skill were different enough to keep things interesting and make it feel like you could make a minor strategic decision in what type of deck to build for them. The overall game is pretty short, took me a few days of brief sessions to beat, but it does feel like a complete game. I'm not sure if I will go back and play it again to try out deck builds, so I'd say the replay value isn't huge. For the time to beat + the fun game mechanics I think the asking price is quite fair.

The UI is laid out in a very inefficient manner. Everything building related is buried in submenus, and things you only use very rarely like tech tree or going into graphs view have prominent always-on-screen buttons. The inconsistent function of buttons in the building info panels were equally frustrating - they're all the same size and shape and in generally the same location, but some are functionality toggles, some are upgrades, some are commands. The waiting period between first colonists arrival and being allowed to bring more in means you have a ton of time spent doing nothing because you quickly reach the point where you can't do anything else until you get more colonists. When starting out, before you're self sufficient, you have to spam ships from earth laden with stuff you need. Not only is it unsatisfying to feel completely dependent, but this adds to the general feeling of helplessness and boredom during the initial colonist waiting period. Once you're beyond the initial grind, and you start building your base, you'll quickly realize what an absolute pain in the ass it is to build anything. Some buildings have damage zones where they'll hurt other buildings that are too close. These zones do not show up when you go to put new buildings down, so you have to memorize the range and guestimate your placement. In order to exploit resources that are unreasonably spread out, you either have to build duplicates of every basic building or lay down tons of wire and pipes that block the hexes they're placed in. Drones don't just allocate themselves to where they're needed, you have to manually couple them to whatever control building can reach the jobs, even if there's overlap in the control area. In fact, why don't connected drone support areas form a mesh network? That would make sense, and more importantly wouldn't waste the player's time shuffling drones around. The drone issue is pretty typical of my problem with the game, it's unnecessarily tedious and focused on micromanagement of tasks that really aren't any fun. I don't want to manually reallocate super sad workers that are too dumb to swap jobs when there are better ones open, I don't want to be shuffling drones around, I don't want to have to constantly tell my mining truck to go find a new deposit, I don't want to have to memorize bad spots to build because the UI won't show me them while building, I don't want to spend the first 30-60 minutes shipping goods from earth while waiting to be allowed to import enough colonists to actually run the buildings that I can totally afford to build.

76561197992783558,24,Age of Rivals,"Indie, Strategy",Recommended,"Unlock system puts strategic choices behind a big grind, and game has much more randomness than your usual card game. Very disappointed in this game. You earn coins as you play and for doing quests, which let you buy packs of cards that randomly give you more cards that will show up as you play, or character cards that let you work towards unlocking 3 special slots for the various decks. The special slots let you guarantee a card will appear in your game, and they're the only control you have over your deck. Unlocking them goes quite slowly though, in 3 hours I had only unlocked 1 slot for most deck options, and I hadn't unlocked the second slot for any. Basically you're presented with the knowledge that you could inject some strategy into your deck, but you won't be allowed to for many many hours. Each turn each player is shown 4 different cards and buys 1, then the remaining 3 are passed to the other player. The first cards presented to each player every draw dramatically affect what you can do, especially if it's an instant knockout card. Then after every round you randomly keep 4 of the 8 cards you bought that round, which will carry over to the next round. The difference between the game picking 4 resource cards vs useful cards is massive. This game left me feeling more frustrated than anything else.

For pure solo play vs AI, you might want to skip it. I didn't try it against other people online, so I can't speak to how well it plays or how quick it is to find games. The UI is presented nicely, using left clicks and right clicks in ways that feel natural, and with two very nice option sliders for speed of play and display. The card information is presented clearly and easy to access during gameplay. My biggest complaint is that you can't see what is in the sets and read cards outside of actually launching a game. As someone new to the game but familiar with other deckbuilders, I was able to pick it up quickly and move up to the hard AI pretty quickly. That being said after only a few games the Hard AI was only marginally challenging to me, and I imagine skillful or experienced players would find it even easier than I do. So as a purely solo exercise, it's fun to see what's in the various card sets and test strategies, but the lack of challenge hurts replayability.

76561197992783558,24,Card Quest,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"Fantastic deck-building game. As you clear areas you unlock items for 6 slots, each item adds a few cards or an ability you can use periodically. Each item is tied to one of the slots, and by mixing and matching you can heavily customize your deck. I found the game very hard until I realized that you need to play across the 3 different quests, not just focus on one. This allows you to clear the easy areas in all the quests to unlock more item options. One warning: while the art is good, you spend pretty much the whole game fighting enemy pictures on a black background. Outside of the theme of the cards/monsters and some quick text storytelling, you won't really see the world you're in. The combat mechanics and enemy design are tight and well crafted, you can dramatically change how your deck plays, and there's 4 characters with completely unique unlocks and playstyles.

76561197992783558,24,ICY: Frostbite Edition,RPG,Recommended,"Well written story-focused game in an interesting postapocalyptic ice age. There are RPG elements and a decent amount of simple combat, but the game mainly focuses on text based events and story decisions. The game's branching story may be hit or miss for some people as there is often one choice that feels like the ""good"" one, but I felt like the options were generally realistic and fit with the theme. There are a few bugs where the main quest can fail to trigger the next step, so I recommend saving periodically using the multiple save slots to give yourself staggered backups, and you may need to check the forums if reloading doesn't fix it. Other than that my biggest frustration was that there wasn't any indication which loot was vendor trash and which loot would be useful for crafting later. I really enjoyed experiencing the world, interacting with the people, the feeling of progression in my group, and reading the story.

76561197992783558,24,Aven Colony,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"A good but not great sci-fi colony builder. If all you want is sandbox, it's pretty formulaic, and you should probably skip it. But if you enjoy campaign missions, there is a lengthy campaign that has plenty of scripted events and tasks for you to accomplish. The UI covers all the mandatory basics, but it has many flaws. The overlays obscure the ground and buildings so it means you have to constantly toggle them on/off to figure out where to build your farms, police, etc. And some critical elements (like crowding) do not have an overlay so you have to check individual upset colonists and see where they live to figure out where you have to build support buildings. It's a pretty game, but at the same time building could be cooler. I get that it's basically 3D printing but having buildings gradually fill in was unsatisfying, it would have been nice if there was some sort of partially built framework progress. You can scale your difficulty before you start a mission, but frustratingly the slider bars are all forced to default values. For example I want to have an economy challenge but I don't like environmental disaster damage. Unfortunately there's no way to scale up the difficulty of one without the other. There's also no nice way to say ""show me all my buildings of X type"" so for example you can see if any are underperforming, or  what areas are covered by various support buildings like bars. Your stockpiles can't be displayed in your UI, and there's no filters for the storage list window. It would be nice to know if I'm running low on anything at a glance instead of having to constantly pop up a window and scroll through a long list. All that being said - everything works, there's plenty of buildings to build, there's a decent challenge in building up your city while balancing growth vs resources, the campaign provides a decent variety of tasks and goals, and the colonist simulation is well done. It's a chill fun city builder with a nice campaign but not a lot of depth and many minor UI frustrations. If that sounds fun to you, I think you will enjoy this game.

The other option is keyboard only, no mouse binds allowed, which I personally find more difficult than using a controller. I am very bad at brawlers and games that require precise timing, although I do enjoy them, so I thought this game was worth a try. While I found it quite frustrating at times, I really enjoyed it and will play it more in the future. The basic concept is if you overheat you die, and everything outside of basic movement generates heat (using movement ability and basic attacks generate a little, getting hit and using special abilities generate a lot). The aesthetic and sound are very well done and enjoyable. Attacks feel powerful, there is a fun variety of enemies, and I really enjoyed the heat mechanic - I actually had to be precise and planned instead of just button mashing my way through. I did have some problems with the combat though. It was hard to tell if you were on the same height (z-level) as enemies. Sometimes the purple highlighted enemy would not get hit and I don't know why. It felt like some weapons, especially the gauntlets (punch), could clip through targets instead of actually hitting them. You earn abilities seemingly randomly as you progress through the floors, and you can lose them if you die. You can accumulate shields that save you from a death, you can earn continues where you start a few floors lower with random items, so it is forgiving in a sense. Starting over without a key move was super frustrating, but you do earn them back pretty quickly as you replay. I don't know that there's a lot of replayability to this game. While the levels are well randomized, they are small and quick to play through, and the game is only 13 levels long. I don't know if there's an endless mode after that since I didn't beat it in a couple of hours of playtime, but I imagine someone who is very good at this type of game would beat it rather quickly.

I enjoyed exploring the world and establishing towns, it felt like I was adventuring in an interesting world and expanding my power and influence. But beyond that I quickly grew frustrated. The realtime turn-based game system didn't really work for me. Turns felt too long when moving, and too short when making decisions. The UI was too limited. It felt like I could see too little of the world, there was no way of knowing which of my towns had actually produced the goods I needed, and it was hard to see what I was carrying on my ship if I had many different types of units + goods. The biggest problem for me is I keep dying a couple of hours in. The game gives me a mission to explore ruins, which unleash some unhittable ghost that repeatedly summons strong skeletons, causing me to lose. Can I avoid this? Can I do something with my ship/empire to stand a chance? The game doesn't provide any clues, and I'm not willing to start over yet another time without any real hope of progress.

76561197992783558,25,Frostpunk,"Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"I highly recommend this game if you fall into one of the following three categories: - you want to play a city builder (Cities Skylines, SimCity, etc) that puts more pressure on you to survive - you have always wanted to get into basebuilding games (RimWorld, Dwarf Fortress, etc) but have found them a bit overwhelming - you love basebuilding games and you're still interested in something story driven that has a more limited scope I just beat the first scenario on Normal (after one restart due to learning how building placement needs to be managed), and I can't wait to play the other scenarios - and replay the first one. The atmosphere is fantastic. I really felt like I was part of a desperate struggle to survive an ice age apocalypse. I loved the aesthetic of the town, and the feel of the world around it. This may be a drawback if you're not into post-apocalyptic or survival type scenarios, or if you don't like occasional scripted story events. The game limits how much of the world you get to interact with and streamlines your management and building options, but still gives you tons of meaningful choices to make.

It took me 10 hours to 5-star all 20 levels, to give you an idea of their scope. This game is slightly different from Train Valley 1. The tracks building is the same, but instead of randomly spawning stations and random extra trains, now all the station positions are fixed, and you control where trains spawn. Your goal instead is to move goods to produce things your city needs. The rail building mechanic remains the same. It can be a little aggravating to get to the very end and miss your time target by a few seconds, but fact that the levels are quick help reduce the frustration. I really enjoyed needing to plan out my routes to efficiently reach production buildings, and figuring out how to generate money early each level to save up for the more expensive tracks and upgrades.

Click-drag to change town/ship views feels like it was designed for touchscreen rather than a mouse, and the allocation of crew and ship upgrades take unnecessary extra clicks, making the management parts of the game a chore. Third person captain combat when boarding another ship is just all wrong, from how you move to how it registers mouse clicks. I think spotting with the spyglass doesn't work if your ship is between you and what you're trying to spot (using a low viewing angle). Turning a ship to fire broadsides at another ship has been done well in many other games, but somehow in this game it is overcomplicated and clunky.

76561197992783558,26,Nyheim,Strategy,Recommended,"Fun single player dice-based board game. RNG can be brutal if you get unlucky, very strong early enemies can present unbeatable obstacles. Fortunately that doesn't happen too often. Also food, which lets you reroll your dice, is scarce early on. These two factors may combine to make it seem more frustrating than it is. You can mitigate these a few ways: you can tweak your starting character's dice so they have more balanced results, you can rush your first 2 quests to get 2 more people (for more dice to roll), and you can spend a few early turns on a food-rich square to stock up. You can still end up totally screwed, in which case just chalk it up to bad luck and restart. Once you get the hang of it, it's not that tough to consistently beat the game. I think some of the negative reviews that took issue with the RNG weren't carrying enough food, especially by the time winter rolled around. I'd usually stock up to about 40-50 food, you really need to be able to slam rerolls. Also hunting down skill books is key, they give you unlimited once-per-roll dice face changes or rerolls. The achievements' requirements force you to limit yourself instead of just playing for the easy victory, which nicely added replay value for me. One or two require a bit too much luck for my liking, but for the most part they were a fun way to extend my enjoyment by making me tweak my playstyle and think creatively while upping the difficulty.

Am I running the right dungeons, am I leveling my characters properly, am I using the right materials, am I buying the right gear, should I be changing my classes? No clear answers emerged, and the whole time I was bored by the tedious dungeons and combat. Combat is simplistic, either your front row melee attacks or 1 back row guy does something at range.  Dungeons and monsters all feel the same. There's minimal customization for characters, to the point where it feels like you have almost no control over their progression. There's dozens of ""Master"" dungeons but they're unsorted with no way to filter for ones that match your level range. There's lots of different items but none are interesting. Both in your bag and in the shop, you can't filter them by class, and there's no comparison to what you have equipped. Also some of the item text is just confusing - does ""projects an ominous aura"" actually affect combat and if so, how? Despite a mountain of text in the help file, lots of things are unexplained or explained poorly. What does ""Hit rate"" mean and is it better higher or lower? What do ""Fellows"" do? And so on.

76561197992783558,26,Card Crawl,"Casual, Indie, RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"Very fun, well crafted, simple game hampered by its unnecessarily grindy quest/unlock system. You play against a random deck drawn from a fixed set of cards 49, and you get to choose 5 ""ability"" cards to mix in for a total of 54. The ability cards are fun, but you're heavily reliant upon the luck of when they show up. You unlock more ability cards with credits you earn as you play. Credits earn decently fast and you can read card descriptions before you pick which one you want to unlock, so earning them is not bad at all. The problem is the quests and achievements. They tend to be heavily luck based, and they require repetition so you're burying yourself in not only getting that lucky draw once, but 10 or more times. Some examples might help illustrate my point. One is to beat the deck 10 times while throwing all 5 of your ability cards in the trash. The problem is even if you play perfectly, about half of the time the deck isn't beatable without using your ability cards. Beating it once this way was fun, having to grind through dozens of plays to accomplish it 10 times was not. Another is to beat the deck 10 times with over 20 health. There's only 2 ability cards that give you more health, and they won't push you over 20 alone. You're reliant upon comboing with other ability cards that increase their value. So you're heavily reliant upon drawing a specific few cards in a specific order. It's possible but again to achieve this 10 times is going to take dozens of games. It's frustrating knowing that you've played as best you can and you had absolutely no chance due to the shuffle of the cards - and you're going to have to do this over and over again until you get your lucky draw 10 times total. That being said, the quests and achievements do give you a reason to change your 5 ability cards in creative and fun ways. So conceptually they're great, I think the main problem is needing to do it 10 times. I've had great fun with the game, but I think not everyone will find the same level of enjoyment, so I'm giving it a tentative thumbs up. If you can deal with luck based grind and you enjoy striving for achievements, then this might be a nice game for you.

The game rewards the lead car because the leader gets to pick up buff items, and their respawn timer is so long nobody reasonably close will even get to see them.

76561197992783558,27,N/A,N/A,Recommended,"Since Steam requires a yes/no, I'll give it a thumbs up, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it for everyone. This is a decent start to a base building game (ala Gnomoria, RimWorld, etc) but currently it's missing any reason to keep playing once you get food production set up. If you're a fan of the genre and willing to take a risk on Early Access, I'd say it's worth a shot, especially if you prefer to play pacifist mode and focus on building structures. However if you like challenge or conflict, or prefer to buy Early Access games that feel mostly complete, you should wait on this one. I really like the base mechanics of the game, it gets the genre staples right - mining, farming, tech, building up a town, etc. The world generation is pretty cool, I enjoyed the landscapes and flora and fauna. There are some minor issues that work fine, it would be cool if they were more fleshed out but they're not game breaking. Mining only goes straight down (as far as I could tell), building stuff just instantly happens with a mouse click, goods storage/retrieval is instantaneous magic, animals you've herded into pens tend to clump up in one spot instead of wandering the space you've given them. The first major issue is performance. On big maps it tanks hard, but even smaller maps hit major processing lag. I'd say the #1 culprit is pathing, especially if you're trying to do stuff across rivers. The #2 culprit appears to be when you have a build/crafting menu open, especially if a spinning object preview is being displayed. The second major issue is that once you've got food production set up, there isn't anything to do. You can build to your heart's content, but there is zero pressure to survive. Not a problem for people who just want to build, but I prefer to have some kind of challenge. The third issue is resource generation. Lots of food and crafted good require specific materials, and if you don't spawn with the right seeds and your world doesn't generate the materials you need, I don't really know what you're supposed to do. For example stone is an important component for several key crafting buildings, and I scoured my small map for hours looking for stone until I'd built everything I could without it and I had to just give up. Increasing the spawn rate for key goods might help, or making the recipes more flexible by allowing alternate materials might help. I really like games like this and I think this game has a lot of potential. After 13 hours of mostly enjoyable gameplay, I won't say I'm disappointed with the game, but I think it could be better. People who enjoy just building stuff should be able to even more playtime than that, but until some of the above issues are addressed I won't be playing any further.",20.3 hrs on record																					(13.1 hrs at review time),N/A

I found the story to be a little WTF while going through it but at the end I think it came together nicely. I thought it was going to be about using a train to build up a group of survivors, stopping at dangerous stations to gather up supplies to make the train bigger/stronger/etc. That is not what this game is about. You go from station to station, you do have to keep survivors alive during a brief travel minigame (it's not hard once you get the hang out it), but at each station you drop people off and pick up new people. You also venture out into the stations to gather supplies, it's a bit of a 2d platform shooter (if that's the right terminology). You don't build up the train, nor do you build up a big clan of survivors. Overall the gameplay is okay but what kept me coming back is the atmosphere and story. Bad Things are happening and as a lowly train operator you get to see/know a bit more than Joe Average but things are still a little mysterious and sometimes confusing. I usually prefer gameplay over story, but the gameplay was decent enough and the story was my kind of thing, so I enjoyed this one from start to finish. That being said, some people won't like the story. Thing's aren't always plainly spelled out, and some people might find it cliched, overwrought, nonsensical, etc. Everyone has their own taste and in a story focused game it's a lot harder to say ""XYZ is good"" like it is with gameplay.

It kinda ended up not being what I hoped on both fronts - but I think it still might be fun depending upon what you want. To start out you have to spend points (""interventions"") to spawn random plants, bugs, etc by category. They drop into their world and just do their own thing, you have no control. As you spawn stuff, it goes into your list of stuff you've seen, where you can see details - certain bugs feed off certain plant types, etc. To build a thriving ecosystem you have to spawn in specific things that are compatible with eachother. So for me having to look at a list to determine what worked well together was a little less chill than I was hoping, but at the same time having zero control over everything else was too little world management for me. I don't think it's a bad game, it was just almost-but-not-quite what I enjoy. It does work well as sort of a world-aquarium type thing.

76561197992783558,28,Space Hulk: Deathwing,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"Multiplayer: Not recommended, due to bugs Single player: Recommended, if you want a straightforward mech romp splatting bugs Gameplay is you're in a suit of badass mech armor with fun weapons and unlimited ammo, stomping through a gigantic space hulk - a ton of ancient ships fused together. The plot guides you through objectives as you lay waste to hordes of aliens that die in a satisfying shower of giblets. Performance is not well optimized so be ready to turn down some settings if your comp is not high end. In single player you have a wide array of abilities and weapons that unlock as you complete missions, along with a skilll tree that provides passive buffs, new abilities, and squad buffs. You have 2 supporting squad members, one heavy fighter and one healer. The healer is pretty dumb, you have to manually tell it to heal everything. The AI is okay but not impressive. There's not a ton of tactics required but the atmosphere and combat are both fun. Multiplayer largely follows a similar mission layout without the cutscenes or collectibles. There are several classes, each with much more restricted abilities and weapons than single player, but it works well. You go from objective to objective, clearing rooms and hallways. It never gets more complicated than ""stick together"" and ""focus the big guy or high damage enemy"". It's simple but very fun. Biggest gameplay frustration is each mission you start over at a low level and have to re-unlock stuff you just had, but that goes pretty quick so it's not so bad. The problem with multiplayer is the bugs. There's so many that it has hurt the ability for my group of friends to enjoy the game. Here's a list of what I can think of right now: - I crash about 25% of the time when going into my inventory/loadout (playing as host, not sure if that matters). - 3 friends have had all their attacks stop working, multiple times. They can move and look around but not attack. They were only able to fix by exiting game and restarting. - Random crashes, seems like my friends crash about once per 2-3 hours randomly. - Random lockups, sometimes the game will freeze for 2-5 seconds and then let you resume. While locked up you'll keep moving in one direction and often end up somewhere bad. - Mission objective markers and info rarely show up for non-hosts. This results in non-hosts getting lost/frustrated as they feel like they're just wandering around with no objective - Mission objectives can get screwed up by someone joining the game. I had an objective to take and hold an area, we were halfway across the map and someone joined and it started the timer and we won without ever reaching the area. - Even as host sometimes my objective breaks, so we end up wandering around. One mission we beat when I got a timer bar with no explanation of what it was, and it took about 10 minutes to slowly fill in. - There are some objectives that are to break an object. This information doesn't seem to share well between players. Someone will keep shooting the object still because it doesn't look broken for them. When things are all working, it's a ton of fun. But I haven't played a single game where everything worked smoothly, and I haven't completed 2 missions in a row without at least 1 friend suffering a catastrophic failure. Hopefully this game gets patched to at least be more stable because it is everything I wanted from a multiplayer power-armor romp through a giant space derelict.",11.9 hrs on record																					(11.1 hrs at review time),N/A

And then there's the F2P aspect. Instead of equipping weapons for different attacks you have to unlock heroes that cost about $5 each in grindable game currency. Aside from a few default traps, traps and trap upgrades seem to only come as random drops from chests. You can get limited chests by beating levels once, after that you can buy them.

I'm really surprised I haven't heard many people talk about this game, it is very good. Gameplay is run and gun, you have a default attack and 2 special skills, one of which you can upgrade/change (if you get lucky). You can unlock per-run character buffs from a randomized skill tree, you get one buff whenever you beat a level and you can find others via cards. Levels are a card layout sort of like solitaire - when you beat a card you get access to the cards it was covering. Each card can be an arena (fight and kill) or buffs/shops/etc. Roguelite elements are: if you die you have to start over at the beginning (game level 1 of 6, no buffs from last run, etc), and by completing multiple missions (basically mini-achievements) you unlock permanent character buffs. The combat is fast paced and smooth, there's a great variety of interesting enemies, managing spells is really fun, the randomized skill tree works surprisingly well, and I really really liked the music. It's taken me 5.5 hours to beat the game on normal with the first char, and I'm definitely going back for more with the other chars. If you're really good at this type of game you might find normal easy, but there is a hard mode which I won't be trying haha - I am terrible at iso/top-down shooters so I'm happy that normal is doable for me.

Kinda breaks the illusion. - Minor bugs like two guys trying to level one terrain spot get stuck in an up/down loop, or animals getting stuck in a building and making it hard to click stuff, lots of little stuff like that - (edited) Feels like you can negate most dangers by using tech to ""solve"" events and becoming friendly with all factions, game could use something to add pressure/tension at that point. Harder biomes / expeditions don't really change how the game plays. Ugly: - (edited) If you are building something and missing mats, about 20% of the time it either tells you the wrong mats or pretends you do have the mats and just doesn't build it. - Can't see resources without clicking into a submenu and clicking filters. And you have to check this constantly to see how your colony is doing, for example to catch when your supply chain is generating a given resource too slowly. - (edited) Serious performance issues as your colony size scales up, starts around 40 colonists and gets real bad by about 75 (removed crashing complaint, 3 crashes in 44 hours isn't that bad imo) - The UI does a very poor job guiding you through the process of building objects. There are multiple issues here: --- When you choose something to build, the UI only tells you what workshop makes the item. Each workshop can have 4 or more workbenches that each produce a subset of items, so you still have to figure out which bench to use. --- Figuring out which bench is a pain in the ass. To see what each bench can make, you have to click on each one and scroll through their list. And if you haven't built every bench and you can't find what you want, you have to keep building benches trying to find it. --- Items you can't build because you need to research them look exactly the same as stuff you can actually build. So you might build every bench and scroll through every item and still not find what you want. Suggestions on how to fix some of the major issues: - Instead of having tooltips say ""Made in Metalworks"" have them say ""Made in Metalworks Smelter"". Just saying the bench would make everything so much more clear and save a ton of time and frustration. - Make it obvious when something can't be built because it hasn't been researched. Put a red X over it, make it a different color, put it in the tooltip, anything! - (edited) When I'm missing a component to build something, make sure the UI tells me the right thing. - Maybe this one isn't so simple, but it would be really nice to be able to toggle resources or categories to show permanently in the UI ala Gnomoria, especially when the full submenu does such a poor job of filtering things. I really enjoyed the world and the gameplay elements.  But games like this revolve around building stuff and monitoring your inventory, and it is disappointing that the UI handles those tasks so poorly. Between that and the slowdown (you can hit 40 population quite quickly) I've decided to set this aside until some of these issues are patched.

76561197992783558,29,Tropico 5,"RPG, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"Short review: Another fine entry in the Tropico series, but not as good as 3 and 4 imo. Mechanics are mostly the same but some design decisions frustrated me. Still fun, but only get this if you've already got 3+4 and want more. Long review: For those unfamiliar with the series, it's a simple city builder that doesn't take itself too seriously. A major highlight is that every person in your city is an actual person you can click on with their own opinions, homes, jobs, families, etc. The dictator theme is amusing. Economics are simple once you get the hang of making money, and as a result sandbox mode is less interesting than traditional city builders. So the custom scenarios and story-mode mission chains are where the real meat of the game is. All of that is basically the same in 3, 4, and 5. So what's new in this version? First of all the campaigns (base game, + 2 dlc campaigns Waterborne and Espionage) take place on 2 islands, with your buildings persisting. And base game + waterborne keep bouncing you back and forth between the islands. This is probably the worst new design decision. It might be a couple missions between times you see an island so it gets to be hard to remember what you were building. Also certain missions make you do wacky things so you might find yourself hamstrung by something a previous mission made you build. I also felt like the campaigns had more ""gotcha"" moments. A couple of times I got more than an hour into a mission just to have a curveball requirement thrown at me that I could not possibly accomplish - for example, building a certain building type within X months where I didn't even have that tech researched yet. Super frustrating. There were a couple of engine tweaks that changed how the game feels. Traffic is much more forgiving and construction feels more automated (rather than waiting on the arrival of individual workers). While those were some major frustrating points from 3 + 4, in 5 it somehow feels almost too smooth or too easy. I think it took away a lot of the charm, a big part of what makes Tropico great is the individual citizens, and the smoothness here really detracted from that individuality for me. Managers were added - citizens with special skills (+productivity, +job satisfaction, etc) that you can assign to buildings. An interesting concept but a real pain to manage. You have to click the building, then click the manager button, then figure out what manager you want to assign. Too much clicking. And when new managers appear you have to click around a bunch to find which buildings don't already have managers. Also a person who already has a job at the cathedral is a military General? So I assign them to my Army Base? So they're working both as a nun and and a General at the same time? Whole thing was unwieldy on every level. The campaign DLC wasn't great this time around either. The Waterborne stuff felt almost like cheating - really good buildings that don't take up land space or tie up transportation, including oyster farms which generate tons of income basically for free right from the start of the game. Espionage was okay, the spying mechanic wasn't really something I ever used outside of its campaign, but the campaign did a decent job of highlighting it. But neither major DLC was game-changing like Modern Times (DLC for 4) or Absolute Power (DLC for 3). Overall 5 just felt a lot easier to set up a super rich economy, the campaigns were a lot more annoying, the new managers mechanic felt more tedious than fun, and the improved traffic and construction somehow felt like they detracted from the game. Still the same solid Tropico core with hours and hours of fun, but for a new player I'd recommend 4 or even 3 over this.

76561197992783558,29,Thea: The Awakening,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"Short review: Incredible game. The game world is laid out sorta like Civ or Endless Legend - a hex based grid with resources, events, enemies scattered about. The big difference is all you ever get is one city. You use your citizens to gather, build, explore, fight, and do quests. Sort of a mash up of a 4x and a survival / base building game. The game's mythology and atmosphere is extremely interesting and well done. Very highly recommended, one of the best games I've played recently. Long review: There is a main story quest (several if you count the DLC lines, all of which are free) and you'll constantly be encountering various other events. Some are repetitive, some only happen once. But they all generally offer many different ways you can solve them, often based on the skills of your characters. Combat is handled via a card system - each of your units (and enemy units) is represented by a card. They're randomly split 50/50 into attack + support. Attack guys can only jump into the field of battle, and support guys can either buff/debuff or jump into battle with a 1 turn cooldown. Each side takes turn playing 1 card (or 2+ if they have lots of units) and once all cards are played they are resolved in order, attacking randomly whatever enemy card is closest to the left or right of them. There are only 2 turns per combat round (after all the cards are out) and then you re-allocate the existing cards. On top of that you'll often have different combat options presented to you - social, physical challenge, actual fighting, hexing, poison, etc. Each depends on a different set of stats on your characters and there's a LOT of stat types. It can be a bit overwhelming at first but I think it adds nicely to the depth of the game. In actual fighting, every time your guys get hit they take wounds, which can result in death if the wounds are too severe. The other challenges are generally a better option since you can take ""damage"" without wounds - but if you fail there will be penalties which can be quite steep, and often times you'll end up having to fight after failing. So even before you jump into battle you're making decisions on how you want to approach encounters. Your units level up universally. So your in-town crafters will still benefit from your raiding party's escapades. Oh and if you craft using better-than-basic materials you get a lot of tech and XP, so an important strategy is to farm a bunch of mats to spam junk items to level up your crew. I'd say the most frustrating part of the game is the very beginning. It's very easy to lose units, especially when you're new and don't know what events/fights are risky. Losing 5-6 guys early on is essentially crippling. But losing 2-3 early is recoverable, and you just have to embrace the fact that you're going to lose some of your guys from time to time. The game's atmosphere and story are excellent. I really felt like I was in a world wrapped in magic and mythology. The main story was also quite interesting and I've seen very different endings based upon what starting god I chose and the way I approached the main quest. The starting god you choose does make some difference to how the game plays. At first you only have 2 choices and you unlock more by playing. The gods themselves level up as you play under their banner, but it takes a LONG time to unlock their bonus tiers - or even just to play a full game. Which is fine, I don't think 15+ hours for a single game is unreasonable for this type of game, but that only unlocks level 2 or 3 out of 5 for a given god. So unlocking the top tier buffs will take quite some time. Co-op works well, I rarely had desync problems, and when they did happen I was able to exit + restore at worst losing 1 turn. The biggest issue is you can't do anything when your partner is doing their start-of-turn events, that plus the regular turn-based game imbalance (sometimes one person has a lot of stuff to do when the other person is ready for the next turn instantly) makes for a lot of down time. I got some good mileage out of my smartphone while playing co-op. But I think that's just the nature of this type of game played multiplayer, so I don't have any complaints. There is strong replayability here, every time I play through I think of different ways I want to build up my town or different starting loadouts I want to try. On the other hand, while the world layout changes, the main quest stays generally the same, and you sort of get used to the types of enemies and side quests. So after beating the game 3 times I'm ready for a break - but I'll definitely be playing it again in the future. Overall one of the best games I've played recently. The combat system was surprisingly enjoyable, the game combines some of my favorite elements of base building + survival + 4x games, and the whole thing is wrapped up in a fantastic world of atmosphere and lore. If you're interested in this game at all, I very highly recommend you get it.",121.8 hrs on record																					(76.4 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197992783558,30,RymdResa,"Adventure, Indie, RPG",Recommended,"Short review: Chilled out exploration game with interesting narrative and enthralling graphics. Heavily RNG-driven, built around dying and restarting frequently with gradual permanent progression allowing you to get further. If that sounds good to you, I highly recommend this game. Long review: You pilot your ship around exploring stuff you come across which triggers events. Sometimes you get rewards, sometimes you get bad results, sometimes you get insta-killed. Sometimes space debris or suns or mines will kill you as well. Your ship's gear will persist through death, as do the stats you get for leveling up, and you can earn one-time buffs for your next playthrough. I still haven't beat the first story chunk and I'd say the most frustrating thing is the amount of repetition that seems to be expected - you're often thrown into unwinnable scenarios like instagib random events or too much stuff on screen to avoid. It seems to me that the only way to get through those types of things is by leveling up your stats and gathering better ship gear. I'd find this much more frustrating if the game's general atmosphere (story and art) wasn't so cool in an eerie sort of way. I'm also looking forward to unveiling more of the story by actually progressing a bit. I've been playing on normal but I'll probably start playing on easy instead.

76561197992783558,30,Northmark: Hour of the Wolf,"Adventure, Casual, Indie, RPG",Recommended,"An okay game where combat is based on cards. Recommended if you want a fairly simple time waster. You fight battles where your 3 henchmen face off against 2-3 enemies. Everyone has abilities with multi-turn cooldowns, and a deck of cards, all of which can buff, debuff, and attack. Your main character gets some stat points that buff your units in battle, you acquire more cards as  you progress through the game, mostly bought with coin earned by doing tasks or fighting battles. The plot is pretty simple, the writing is okay, there's kind of a lot of text but I never got irritated by it. The stat points are very minor bonuses, the cards are fairly simple - it's pretty easy to figure out which ones are the best, and there's no real deep choices. The battles are easy, especially once you've earned some new cards. It takes about an hour to even get enough cards where you have to make choices about what to bring with you - honestly that's the worst thing about the game, it started off so slow and limited I was concerned it wouldn't be fun. But after a bit I had enough cards to make battles entertaining, even though they never were really challenging. All in all a competent but unexciting game. Giving it the thumbs up because I enjoyed it, but really it's best for people not looking for a lot of depth or challenge out of the deck building mechanics.",4.6 hrs on record,N/A
76561197992783558,30,Planetship,"Action, Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"A very chill and trippy game where you're a planet-sized spaceship cruising the galaxy. You warp from system to system, scanning planets and landing shuttles to resupply, occasionally having to fight off or avoid hostile planets or ships or whatever. There's mini-events as you encounter aliens and whatnot, there's some very limited crafting using elements you pick up from gas clouds or blowing up stuff, and the end goal apparently is to find another planet for humanity, but really the game feels more like an unguided space acid trip. For me it was a little too unguided, a little too wander-y. I like games that are a more driven, where I can sort of feel myself taking steps towards a goal. So I personally got tired of the game pretty quick, and it's definitely not for everyone. But I do think it is a very good game for anyone who likes slower paced open-ended explorey games that don't pressure you too much, especially if you want to play something super unique and very trippy.",2.8 hrs on record,N/A
76561197992783558,30,Boss Monster,"Casual, Indie, Strategy",Recommended,"Short review: Card game where you entice adventurers into your dungeon to kill them. While the game mechanics seem fun, I strongly do not recommend this game because the game UI is so horribly buggy and slow it's completely unfun to play.  Even if you got this game for free, I would recommend you spend your time elsewhere. Long review: It's a competitive card game where you draw cards representing rooms and spells, trying to entice adventurers into your dungeon so you can kill them, and trying to help adventurers survive / not enter your opponents' dungeons. You get 5 slots on the board to build rooms in, you can stack rooms on top of eachother. Rooms have items associated with them, and adventurers pick the dungeon with the most of their desired item to enter. You draw one room per turn, and you get to play one room per turn. Some rooms have special abilities, and you can get spell cards that do special stuff too. I really loved the concept of this game, and mechanically it seemed like something that would be fun and interesting to play. Unfortunately the UI design absolutely killed any hope I had of enjoying the game. Each time an adventurer enters a dungeon, it has to step through each of the player's rooms (up to 5). But in each room the game provides a few seconds for players to decide if they want to play a spell or activate a room ability. Which doesn't sound that bad - except an average game has 15-30 adventurers, and 90% of the time you don't have anything you want to do during the wait period. These few seconds per step add up to a ton of time sitting there thinking ""hurry up, come on already"" - extremely aggrivating. You interact with the game by dragging cards around. You drag your rooms onto the board slots for them, you drag your spells onto the center to cast them, etc. Except the UI constantly screwed up what card I was trying to pick. I'd click and drag on a card, and constantly end up with the wrong card landing. Sure it's easy to undo that positioning, but at the same time it's annoying - especially when it felt like it was happening about 1/3 of the time. It really is too bad the game is so hard to interact with. The card game behind it all seems quite fun. As I mentioned in my short review, I strongly do not recommend this game, even if you get it free your time is better spent elsewehre.",4.4 hrs on record																					(1.4 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197992783558,30,Valhalla Hills,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"Short review: Base building game focused on space (fitting necessary buildings into limited space) and resource (how do i make enough food while still growing my town) management, with some minor combat. You beat one map and go to a new one without any particular story, and you have to start your town from scratch each time. Gets quite repetitive after you've unlocked all the buildings and figured out an optimal build pattern. Some minor AI issues are quite annoying. Recommended for fans of the genre who don't mind simpler game mechanics. Long review: The main challenges of gameplay: 1 - build up your town while maintaining food supply. You'll learn pretty fast what build pattern works best for food, and how to place your food buildings so that your town is well covered. 2 - deal with threats. You'll need an early military to wipe out fixed threats like wolves and bears so your town can expand. Mid game military is dedicated to wiping out dwarf colonies so they stop harassing your town. Usually that's enough for the end game - killing the portal guardians. 3 - fitting everything in. Wheat farms are super important and they need empty fertile space around them, I generally had to plan my entire town on how to fit them in. The major negatives of the game: - Every map you start from scratch. It's fun at first but by my 15th map or so I was pretty sick of building the same exact buildings in the same exact order. Starts to feel real grindy and repetitive. - You can't micromanage anything. You build a woodcutter, and it would be nice if he cleared the trees from your town, but he just chooses at random from stuff in range. This renders storage buildings completely useless because you can't tell them what NOT to store - specifically food, because you need food locations spread out to cover all your other work buildings. - Bad AI problems. You have a nicely stocked bakery or fishery but your worker will walk right past it to trek way out into the wilderness to some berry bush... right next to the wolves' den. Blergh. Or your hunter will get stuck in a loop ""looking for a better weapon"" when there's plenty of low-tier enemies to hunt. You don't need a bone spear go kill some rabbits and get me some meat and leather! - Managing military is a pain. Military units suck down resources so you have to assemble an army and then disband it every time you're done dealing with a threat. You can't tell military where to go, you can only move the military camp building around the map, and your units will fight things nearby. You learn to be careful with that placement as well because the units will fight willy nilly and your healers won't focus the lowest guy, so you need to compensate with careful building placement. - randomized maps are sometimes crap. I had one map where the exit portal was completely 100% unreachable. Or start areas will have no trees realistically in reach with enemies in the nearby woods, making fighting them off nigh impossible. Or the entire map will be peppered with mini-fjords, leaving no real open space to build an actual town. By the time I was done playing I was just resetting the map to get a decent start layout. - the big hyped ""get your units to valhalla"" theme doesn't seem to actually do anything. They get a gold star or whatever but they weren't noticeably amazing. Kind of a letdown really. All that being said, I played the game a ton, and I greatly enjoyed it up til the point where it started felling repetitive - which was about 30 hours. Not bad at all! Still it's not something I can unreservedly recommend to everyone. You have to be a fan of the base building genre (see: gnomoria, rimworld, planetbase, dwarf fortress), you have to be interested in the space and resource management elements, and you have to be cool with the game being pretty shallow mechanically.

I like a lot of the concepts a lot, if some depth and variety is added it could be quite fun. I rated this positive because it's not a bad game especially for the price point but right now I'd only recommend it to anyone who really wants a very simple quick-to-play action rpg with some text adventure elements. Things I liked: - Building up a home base - Bite-sized text/combat sections are nice if you want a quick play - General RPG progression What needs work: - Combat isn't very fun or deep - Combat levels could be more interesting - More text events needed - Mappable hotkeys needed You play as one of two classes (a new class should be added soon) as you go through a horizontal list of encounter options - fighting, text, or ""gamble"" which could be either. Combat is generally a bunch of guys spawning and coming at you while you mash your attack button and pop abilities on cooldown. Text based stuff is decent, you're presented with a scenario with a couple of options. I saw most text events multiple times, so there definitely needs to be more of those. I enjoyed building up the town, with the feeling that multiple heroes are coming through and improving things to benefit future heroes. Some of the UI stuff could use some work. The game has potential but it's risky to buy on potential alone. You're probably better off waiting to get this but at the same time it's decent enough for its price point, so I can't give it a negative rating.

I enjoyed my time with the game a lot. You control a squad of Dwarves, you ""research"" tech by completing earlier tech, and you get spells to cast. Waves of monsters come at night so you have to defend your base. Underground digging can unearth dangerous monsters too. Don't get it for multiplayer. I read about how to get that working a couple months ago, I gave up before even trying. No saves and it requires an advanced single-player game structure or something. High points for me was enjoyable digging/exploring experience, fun managing a group of guys (something I enjoy a lot, as opposed to singular direct control ala Terreria), building infrastructure like elevators and railroads, building up a base structure. Low points include tedious craft UI, fun techs come late in the tech tree (railroads come after you've had to build a ton of infrastructure already), low variety of enemies, night-time enemy waves get annoyingly strong eventually.

76561197992783558,31,Sid Meier's Starships,Strategy,Recommended,"A super simplified 4x game. It is incredibly shallow but it had enough decisions involved for me to enjoy it as sort of a mindless time waster. I beat it once on normal and never looked back. I wouldn't pay more than a deep sale price for it (66%+). You get to take over planets, research tech, build a fleet, and fight other empires, but everything is very simple to the point of feeling limited. You only get one fleet - yes that's right, one fleet total. The entirety of your combat and conquering happens with that one fleet. You have a ""fleet fatigue"" counter which means you have to manage your turn to be as efficient as possible with your fleet. Research techs have different names but come down to 9 categories that just ""level up"", rather than some kind of tree with decisions to make about similar space drives with different advantages or anything like that. There are ""wonder"" type things that provide bonuses. Planets can have very simple buildings built to improve them. Combat is turn based with a hex grid, and you get to make decisions on how you outfit your fleet (weapons/shields/etc take up space and add weight which require stronger weapons to move farther per turn). Overall I felt like the decision making was fun and I especially enjoyed outfitting my fleet and planning out my turn movements. But it also was so simple that by the time I beat a game it felt like I'd seen everything I needed to see. I have 5.5 hours playtime total, but I did spend a couple scrapped games figuring things out so that's basically 1.5 games. I'd recommend the game if you want a fun simple 4x that's almost mindless, or you like 4x but find them too complex with too much stuff to manage, or you want a simple intro to the genre (although Endless Space is a better intro imo).

A very interesting game with fun turn based concepts, unfortunately a convergence of minor frustrations add up to make it not enjoyable for me. The dice per turn, rerolling, cards, combat, and movement are all enjoyable, and the way they are combined together produce a game that plays like a board game without feeling like a board game, if that makes sense. I also liked the god-dungeon as explanation for why this place exists and why people go into it. Unfortunately there are some problems. Seeing enemy turns is nice because you get to see in detail what the enemy is doing, but it's also time consuming. Which isn't so bad except that any time you fail you have to restart the level. Which wouldn't be so bad except I found myself frequently dumped in situations that were guaranteed failure - stuck on a spot needing 1 type of die (singular of dice) to get out, and even burning all my rerolls and checking my cards couldn't get me that escape. Perhaps I wasn't properly thinking ahead, or there is a key element I was missing - I did only get to level 7 - but with the DM's wide variety of actions (including changing the shape of rooms, rotating rooms, spawning full-room-death hazards, etc) plus extra enemy actors thrown into the mix, it just felt like ""unfair"" deaths were all too common, and the penalty too great (having to start over completely and wait through all those enemy turns over again). It felt like I spent more time waiting than playing, and that's never a good thing. I'm sad that I can't recommend this game, because it has several clever and fun concepts/mechanics.

Reviews that have portrayed it as a kind of ""X-Com with superheroes"" are wrong. It's more like ""Fights in Tight Spaces with superheroes"".  In that sense, I recommend it. The loop of getting better cards after each mission is pretty well done. The heroes themselves play differently enough and have enough unique strategy to them that it makes it interesting to put together teams. The selection of enemies could be broader, but it is not so much worse than, say, Fights in Tight Spaces, and that go me through 107 hours. EDIT: I spoke too soon about variety of enemies, there is at least one point in the game where the variety increases substantially. It is, however, layered over with all of this extra graphics stuff, none of which adds much of anything to the game, really. I mean, some of the dialogue and story stuff is fun; I really like Magik and Spider-man's bits. And playing paper dolls with superheroes is momentary pleasant diversion. But so much effort was put into a game that, honestly, would have been just as good if not better in a full ""Darkest Dungeon"" interface, with well done cell animation and no 3d effects at all.

I say this as a very die-hard Marvel comics fan since like 1979. It's good to see these characters done in a game like this, its almost a dream come true, but at the same time, meh to a lot of their art direction choices.

I love the customisation of the factions, the tomes of magic that are the development tree, the graphics are great, etc. etc. But that AI is so bad, and because it is so bad they have to stack the AI players with so many discounts and special costs, that it is a truly joyless affair beyond the first difficultly level. I'm fighting an AI empire with my army of like 5 stacks of 6 units, the most I can afford to pay upkeep on and keep developing. I defeat one full slightly bigger army of the AI, because it is awful tactically. Within two turns it has completely replenished that army, which I also defeat, but now my army is showing some wear. Two turns later...here comes another army of the same size. This just keeps happening. Tactically, the AI is dumb as a post, but I HAVE to play each of these battles tactically because if I use the ""auto-battle"" feature my general is just as dumb. So I end up playing multiple fairly dull tactical battles watching my army (which takes me a long time to replace) be eroded by the AI's stupid but countless forces. It ruins a sense that you are playing against an opponent that is vaguely similar to you. You are clearly playing as a human, and they are all weird and stupid computers who just can spam out armies 10 times faster than you can. I'm sure there are ways around this, I'm sure there are strategies I could be using to account for this, but I'm equally sure I would not find any of those strategies fun. It's a disappointment, I really was looking forward to this game and spent far more than I should have on getting it. I wish I had waited months for a sale. I'm 104 hours in (not much by 4X game standards) and I feel like I am done, it's just no fun to play against these dumb AI players. UPDATED: I'd heard that maybe they had fixed the AI somewhat. But nope, it still does exactly the same things it did before; spamming massive armies at a far greater rate than a human player with minimal intelligence. So disappointing, because there is so much that is well done in the game. Maybe I am missing something?

There is some meat there, but ultimately it seems like it is just the same thing over and over on each island, and as long as you move on shortly after you have filled up the island indicator, it feels like you could just keep playing endlessly.

For me, I feel it would have been better if there had either been less game or more game to it.  But the amount of game it has exactly the wrong amount for me.  Also, the style of hack and slash involved is something I find a bit tedious. THAT being said, this game has some brilliant innovations, beyond just its general impeccable art and sound.  The way the game works the player through the lack of any heads-up-display or overt tutorial about the rules, for example.   Its all delivered in diagetic ways.

76561198003412713,9,Kingdom Come: Deliverance,"Action, Adventure, RPG",Recommended,"I think a lot of folks would enjoy this game, it has a number of good things about it: * The countryside and the non-human art is gorgeous. * The fighting system is intriguing, and difficult to master, for those who enjoy a challenge. * Its realistic premise is a breath of fresh air, no fantasy elements at all. * The main character is engaging, and I enjoyed the emotional roller coaster the poor chap is going through. But after 15 hours of play...I'm just not into it. * The countryside is great, but the characters in the conversations and cutscenes (of which there are too many and they are too long) seem like they are from 2010, not 2018. * The pacing is...lets call it slow.  There are things to do, but doing them always seems to take at least 10 minutes longer than it was fun to do them. * Because of this, quests that should be funny or thrilling just end up being tedious. Here is an example: early on there is a bit where you are competing with another character to see how many hares you can hunt in a period of time.  Now, I took this seriously, and spent maybe an hour and a half of real time wandering about the forest hunting hares.  It was quite peaceful, even relaxing.  I enjoyed it, I suppose.  Its not like it was bad.  But I also kept waiting for something else to happen.  Like, am I really supposed to be hunting hares?  Or is this just setting me up for something more exciting?  Nope...just hunting hares.  Some people might enjoy that a lot.  It left me a bit annoyed. I really wanted to like this, and you might.  If you have a longer attention span than I do, or get more joy from just wandering around beautiful medieval Bohemia, then it could be the game for you.  I also commend the developers for trying a truly historical game like this; I hope we get more of that sort of thing.

The game is too scripted (and too small) to be a kind of sandbox (e.g Fallout 3), but not scripted enough to be a more traditional FP RPG-like game (e.g. new Wolfenstein games, Bioshock).  It occupies an uncomfortable middle ground.  The cut-scenes (especially the memory cut scenes) were intended to be poignant and/or disturbing, but they are mostly annoying.   The crafting system feels like an unecessary distraction, and the survival elements feel tacked on as opposed to integrated. I think the developers would have been better off to just focus on their excellent visuals and intriguing core story and drop all the ""game-y"" extras.  Make it a shorter, more scripted game.

For the devs, here is how to easily improve the game: - Add a 2x, 5x, 10x game speed option. Games can take a long time, and it seriously sucks to count the minutes - Add tooltips, stats, desciptions to all the units in-game. Best to also add a compendium and a hover feature - Allow more meaningful choice and strategy. Let me choose my 2 star upgrade/direction, let me choose my unit+. I have almost no way to influence the game. Except for using my spell, everything else is random. Why can't I choose a siege unit to better break towers? - Balance the 'higher tier unit received' on both sides. I played the very first map four times, because I only received elf archers, whereas the CPU already had advanced unites. - More meaningful spells, and more leeway to upgrading them. It is the only 'gameplay' I have during a match.",1.3 hrs on record,N/A

Too many cards that do the same, almost no cards that take your strategy to the next level, and then --on top of it-- also the fact that cards have level and experience and you have to grind them by playing as often as possible. At some point this starts to feel like work. Lastly I want to comment that there are some other weird things going on.

There is no story-mode (yet), but its EA and the devs are active. The game lacks a bit diversity, especially in the last turns where all cards are bought.

About the game: MTG meets Chess. Its a card game that plays on a board. At the beginning the board is empty. Each turn you place some lands. Then you summon creatures on the lands. Then you move your creatures to harvest faeria (the single ressource) or fight. Repeat. Also theres a lot of events (some are really mean). And theres structures (they cant move). Why this is good: Because of big plays. Other card games just dont compare. Move the enemy defender away from the opponents orb (the thing you need to destroy) with an event so you can move in and deal the last damage? Check. Turn your own creature into a cute frog that can jump, so you can jump over the enemy creature to play a land in his territory and then play a haste creature and kill him? Check. Play lots of 1/1 creatures in front of your orb and hold the enemy down? Check. Each game has its turnarounds and moments that make you just go ""wow"" and stare at the screen in love (or hate).
