76561198107047766,1.0,Wildfrost,Recommended,"This game is awesome! Sadly, it's being review-bombed at the moment by followers of a popular Chinese streamer, which is really a shame (and something I hope doesn't negatively impact the devs)... But the game is super fun, and feels pleasantly-challenging in it's current state. I can see the devs making some balance tweaks over the coming days/weeks, but it's super fun and enjoyable - as long as you aren't expecting to win every single run without thinking! :)",6.1 hrs on record																					(0.7 hrs at review time),N/A,

76561198107047766,1.0,N/A,Recommended,"I bought this game at full price right after a sale ended, but I'm not even mad- it's absolutely worth the asking price! What we have here is a really well-crafted card game, with a board game feel and some wonderful design work. Each game feels quite unique due to the cards that come into play making reappearances later on- I think it is fun to imagine a story to go along with each game and strategic play, as towers crumble to angry mobs, trade routes form and gain monopoly on desired resources, and empires resort to thieving and over-taxation out of desperation. I did want to touch on something a lot of people have talked about, though. There are complaints out there that this game is ""too random"". In certain gaming circles, ""random"" is pretty much a dirty word- people want their games to be entirely deterministic, but I believe this should not always be the case. Chance is a big factor in many famous games, both videogames and otherwise, and there is nothing wrong with using randomness as an element of your game's design *if* it is balanced well. If it isn't, it's extremely frustrating and pointless, but when it is, it can be an integral and fun game mechanic *while still feeling fair*. The game does utilize some randomness, especially in the drafting mechanic, but it uses that to it's advantage. Instead of being a card game where you have to painstakingly handcraft your deck and worry about being countered by someone else's and losing before you've even started playing, in this game you are building your deck as you play- building your deck *is the game*. The interesting twist on this title from other deckbuilders is that you have to work with what the game gives you. You'll end up playing quite interesting strategies sometimes due to the cards that come into play, and you also are given a lot of chances to try and counter the opponents deck as they are building it (though they might try to do the same to you!). There's also an element of risk-management in the element of chance in some card's effects, but you are meant to either use probability to your advantage (e.g. playing only one card of a type to guarantee it receives a certain buff), or take the chance of a negative outcome as the cost of playing a certain (usually more greedy) way- there has obviously been a lot of thought into the balance of when a little randomness could both help the card's balance and add some interesting strategic plays and moments to the game. I understand that gamers see all randomness as a horrible force of evil, but it can have some very interesting design implications, and if well tested and balanced the results can be a game that's even more balanced, replayable, and fun than a game that is entirely deterministic. This all comes down to personal taste, of course, but you can't deny that the devs have cared a lot about making each card feel fair to the game, and the synergies between them are where this game really shines. The only complaint I have about this game is that each card lacks a bit of personality- this is because each card as the same type-based artwork which, while quite pretty and identifiable, doesn't help make the cards stand out from one another or feel unique. I also think it would be neat if the cards each had a little flavor text, or even a fact from history, to give them even more flair (and give you something to look at while you're opponents make their move. I have asked the devs about this, and they are on board with the idea of adding flavor text in the future, and haven't ruled at doing individual card art at a later date, so I don't think this should be a dealbreaker, especially given the continuous dedication to the game the devs have shown. In conclusion, this game is absolutely worth a buy, especially if you enjoy deckbuilding games and want to try an interesting twist, or want to try a really well designed one out for your first foray into the genre :)",22.8 hrs on record																					(8.8 hrs at review time),N/A,
