It sits on a loading screen before complaining it was unable to load ""online and offline content."" First of all, it's insane for them to require you to be online to launch this game, second I am online.

76561198242204348,1,N/A,Recommended,"You have to install 123091239102 add-ons to play this game and most of them are crackable payware services if you consider buying it or cracking them but nonetheless It all depends on you whether you buy them or crack them. For example: GSX Pro, FS Realistics, Orbx Pro Flow, Navigraph, Volanta, PMDG and Fenix simulations are kind of must have payware add-ons and I don't even include In-Game Marketplace contents yet lmao. Important Reminder: YOU SHOULD HAVE 1 TB DISK STORAGE TO INSTALL ALL THESE ADDONS AND IN GAME CONTENTS, DO NOT TRUST 150 GB STORAGE ON FOLLOWING SYSTEM SPEC REQUIREMENTS.

76561198242204348,1,N/A,Recommended,"After experiencing a lot of hours I think I can have the right to type the good and the bad sides of the game. First of all, I have to tell you that the game is almost not playable unless if you don't have a well working SSD. (Doesn't matter M.2 or SATA) Battlefield franchise has been going down since the last titles of the series. When Battlefield 2042 first released, People said that the game is literally unplayable in every sides. But the good thing is that THE GAME HAS BEEN FIXED TECHNICALLY RIGHT NOW. You don't usually see technical problems if you have a good setup. THE GOOD SIDES AND ITS FEATURES 1-) Playing Sundance and Mackay is actually so fun in Conquest that you can even flank the enemies from behind and get a lot of frags. 2-)The game has faster gameplay mechanics compared to older titles. Which means you can get the fastest kills. Depends on your gameplay but I like it. 3-)Some of Rifles and guns are really cool to play. Rate of fires are much higher compared to BF3 and 4. 4-)Squad Revive. It's not a new feature but I find it ok to include in the series. 5-)Changing Gun attachments is a game changer if you can change and play it correctly. 6-)Cross Play and 128 player servers. Both of them were not really necessary but they make us find the servers easier. 7-)You can finally see how much people there are in the objectives you're playing in (Teammates and enemies). 8-)You can call for a vehicle while you're running as an infantry in that damn vehicle based maps such as Hourglass and Renewal. But it needs a free slot to call it. So sometimes you have to wait for it or give it up. 9-)Battle Pass is worth paying if you only wanna get a lot of xp booster and Battlefield coins as the game refunds some of them as a progression reward. THE BAD SIDES (unfortunately) 1-)The game literally does not have official server browser and choosing the maps you want to play. In that case, It's all RNG. There is only one way to change the maps is that when you click the game mode you're willing to play, the game counts 5 to 0. When it has found a server and in that moment, you can cancel searching the game if you don't want that map. For Example: If you are getting Hourglass and don't want to play it, Then cancel searching the game and try it again until you find a good one. No comment on that. 2-)Sometimes (at least for me) I'm getting black screen when I first launch the game. I have searched a lot of forums, threads and topics in order to fix it but couldn't find any working solution. 3-)There is no team switching. 4-)The game has only 2 countries. Which is not a cool thing to me as Battlefield 4 had 3 countries in it. (Battlefield 1 had 9) 5-) I have mentioned the SSD requirement above. 6-)Sometimes (again) the game is not loading the main menu when leaving the server. It got stuck in Black screen like I got in the first launch. But despite everything, I kinda liked the game. At least It's playable. You should give it a try if you have a good setup and curious about 2042. Thank you for reading.",390.0 hrs on record																					(104.9 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198242204348,2,N/A,Recommended,"NE DENİLDİĞİ KADAR KÖTÜ NE DE ABARTILACAK KADAR İYİ BİR OYUN Öncelikle bu incelememde oyunun her şeyine değinmeyeceğim, bu inceleme oyunun tüm detaylarını ele almayacak niteliktedir. Far Cry ve Ubisoft, bu iki arkadaş buluştuğunda bazen bazı şeyler aceleye gelebiliyor. Oyunu 24 saat oynadım ve bir Far Cry oyuncusu olmadığım halde genel olarak oyundan zevk aldım ancak oyun 1 sezonluk sürükleyici bir Netflix mini dizisi gibi bir anda sona ulaşabiliyorsunuz. Resistance Points ve 3 Boss meselesi sanırsam Far Cry serisinde 5'te ortaya çıkıyor ve oyunun açıkçası gerçek anlamda tek sevmediğim yanı bu olmuştu çünkü siz ana hikaye görevlerini yapmasanız bile bulunduğunuz Region'daki yan görevleri yaparak, Cult'a ait yapıları patlatarak, sivilleri kurtararak, outpost ele geçirerek vb. gibi etkinliklerle Resistance Points denilen bizi o region'ın bossuna götürecek olan sistemin barını fulleyebiliyoruz ve bu bağlamda oyunun içindeki Ana hikaye görevleri yapmadığınız için binevi ÇÖPE gidiyor. Dediğim gibi bu beni bir tık rahatsız eden bir durum o yüzden oyunu oynayacaklara tavsiyem direk ana hikaye görevlerini yapsınlar. Ancak oyunun tabiiki de iyi yanları da var, bize sunulan o American Country havasını oyunda gerçek anlamda hissedebiliyorsunuz, Ubisoft'un bu konuda iyi bir iş çıkardığı aşikâr gerek yol kenarındaki kamplarda country çalan NPC'ler olsun gerek oyunun kendi müzikleri olsun gerekse hayvanlar ve bitkilerin gerçekçiliği gibi çevre faktörleri olsun gerçekten Amerika'nın içinde olduğunuzu hissediyorsunuz. Bu oyunu satın alacaksınız KESİNLİKLE indirim bekleyin. Ben bu oyunu 67 TL gibi bir fiyattan Standart Edition olarak kütüphaneme ekledim ve 67 TL'yi hakettiğini düşünüyorum. Pişman değilim. Arkadaşlar son olarak oyun zevkli bir oyun ancak Far Cry 3 ve 4 gibi oyunları henüz oynamamış bir oyuncuysanız ve onları da merak ediyorsanız Far Cry 5 yerine serinin o iki oyununa yönelmenizi tavsiye ederim.",24.0 hrs on record,N/A

76561198242204348,2,N/A,Recommended,"Skyrim efsanesinden sonra gelmiş geçmiş en iyi RPG oyunu bizler için The Witcher serisidir. Gerek ana görevler olsun gerek ana ve yan görevler olmak üzere çoklu senaryoya sahip olsun Gerekse grafiklerin ve haritanın harika olması bu oyunun bir başyapıt olmasının nedenleridir. Demek istediğim şu ki, eğer günümüzde hem senaryosu iyi olan hemde RPG kategorisine sahip olan bir oyun aramaktaysanız şimdiye kadar The Witcher 3 oynamamanız büyük bir yanlıştan ibarettir. Kesinlikle bu oyunu oynamanızı tavsiye ediyorum ayrıca DLC'leride oyuna farklı bir renk katıyor, bilhassa blood and wine dlc si 20 saatlik bir maceraya çıkmanıza yelken açıyor. Ben oyunun ana senaryosunu bitirdim ve oyunun birsürü farklı sona sahip olduğunu öğrendim. Ayrıca bu oyun Andrzej Sapkowski adlı polonyalı yazarın yazdığı ''The Witcher'' adı altındaki roman kitabı serisinin oyuna uyarlanmış halidir ve ayrıca yakında The Witcher'ın dizisi çıkacak. Yalnız oyunun kötü taraflarından bir tanesi ise bazı seçeceğiniz kontratın ne gibi ödüller vereceği göremiyorsunuz ve kontratı almadan önce de hangi zorlukta olduğunu öğrenemiyorsunuz.

Oyunun iyi yönlerine gelecek olursak en güzel ve zevkli özelliklerden biri olan wingsuit eklenmiş ki oyunun haritasıda çok büyük neredeyse sınırsız bi şekilde wingsuit kullanarak haritayı gezebilirsiniz. Oyunun kötü yanı ise (ki çoğu oyuncununda büyük ihtimalle budur) Just Cause 2 yi oynayanlar bilir oyun resmen bir çığır açmıştı fakat Just Cause 3 diğer Just Cause oyunlarına göre daha beklenmedik bir şekilde çıktı. Çoğu oyuncu daha değişik bir oyun olmasını daha sorunsuz bir oyun olmasını ümid ediyordu fakat oyunda Just Cause 2 ye göre çok az bir değişiklik var.

I think the devs have hit a sweet spot with this latest update. PVP servers are ok, they do have cheaters and the game really isn't built around PVP balancing but that's not where this game shines, it really shines in its always amazing randomly generated maps and its increasing difficulty and various vehicles and goodies for patient players. this isn't just minecraft with zombies. its so much more, this game has made lasting friendships and memories, even from its earliest buggiest builds. but don't be dissuaded by that statement, its a solid game for solo players and mostly how i like to play it these days. i think you guys should add a perma-death toggle and go gold. once you've done that try and port it to consoles and add cross-play amongst some visual updates and bug fixes and i swear this game will be a solid staple for years to come, maybe decades if you keep refining mod support. also that new intro is sexy. give the devs some love people! its been a long road but they have been faithful and this game has earned its full price tag",607.5 hrs on record																					(525.4 hrs at review time),N/A

You won't particularly attach to any characters other than maybe your dispatch guy, who generally won't shut the hell up with nonsense about enemy movements in between the spare bits of story that is usually only a briefing of the enemies actions or your mission which are pretty much to the point with little sprinkles of humour. in fact the cut-scenes are short and few so most of the back story is in audio logs scattered around the open world, the stories are there if you look for them but not in sequential order as they are randomly dotted around.

Overall not very impressed just feels like the same game with clunkier game-play, slightly better graphics, worse optimisation and a kind of OK companion system. i liked the first game from a indie point of view it was unique and well done, now they have been around the block, have better funding and talent, it feels like they took the safe option of remaking the first game with ideas they came up with in hindsight. if their next game is grandsons of the forest i don't think ill be buying. final verdict, maybe wait for VR if you were not a super fan of the first game and want to do it again with revamped mechanics",4.7 hrs on record,N/A

Most CODs i have played since the classics have been bad, save for black ops zombies, this one is genuinely the first non black ops COD i have enjoyed since playing 4 and 5 in high school. Warzone is slightly better than the previous one, but i do miss verdansk. Cheating is virtually non existent, i have not seen any in nearly 200 hours. and the campaign is actually pretty solid, but you would have a good time on DMZ and warzone if you don't want to pay for MW2 although i feel like the campaign and coop stuff was actually worth the investment this time. DMZ is actually good now, And yes i have hundreds of hours in tarkov, but i think DMZ can also earn its place for casual players. there are clear missions and progressions, with all sorts to earn for putting in the time. dying is not game over you can plea for another squad to adopt you. and there is now a disguise for solo players to play stealthily although, this is difficult to get and i would like to see it added to the store. personally after playing DMZ i honestly think COD could translate well if it transitioned to an open world coop game with COOP campaign missions, spec ops, raids, war zone and DMZ all rolled into one. imagine for example a full coop experience playing as each member of ghost squad where in each mission each player has a defined role or objective to advance the story (Like GTA online heists) and it could be played again in a different role with different conditions to earn currency for upgrades, perks and killstreaks to keep replayability fresh and give the player agency over how they advance their progression and story.",259.5 hrs on record																					(0.2 hrs at review time),N/A

There is a shop to buy cosmetic and UI customisations including avatar cards which can be traded for clan upgrades which will end with a repeatable purchase for the microtransaction currency. this is a nice touch as many games won't let you actually earn their currencies. meaning dedicated players can stock this currency up for later on. there is no battlepass in this game but there are weekly challenge modes and open tourneys where you can earn stuff. functionally the game works fine no crashes or problems yet. its a neat game though takes a little while to learn how to play, has a fairly steep learning curve in its very popular ranked mode. the art style is nice and slightly cartoonish. has no Pay to win elements or cheesy bonuses to carry into matches in every match every player will start with the same choices and upgrades. the game receives semi frequent updates adding new units and balances. i would like to see more map themes/locations like a volcano or desert, music and loading screens as it can be repetative and grinding. multiplayer modes with wacky snaking maps would be cool too like Tower Defence games, this is more like a mobile auto-battler/MOBA Lane attacker type hybrid. the game does not command a whole lot of attention to play as you will spend time waiting for units to make it from A to B and fairly generous timers for upgrading between waves. but does require a fair bit of strategy and cooperation as one player underperforming or sending units at the wrong time can sink a game fast",342.9 hrs on record																					(4.1 hrs at review time),N/A

PVP matchmaking is fairly comfortable but its very meta intense everyone's using the same gear and sliding around constantly. i think it could have worked out better without the sliding as i do like slower tactical shooters buts that's just preference, most of you probably like it. i'm an old school crossfire lover and this game almost scratches that nostalgia itch. in essence if you don't know what that is its basically one of the first major free to play call of duty clones around that had a really weird and interesting mix of PVE modes and PVP modes. ranging from capture the flag to two pvp teams surviving a zombie horde, Tower defence and some cool on rails missions, which would earn you premium (purchasable) currencies on harder difficulties to get even better weapons and upgrades. that's about the only reason i play warface its a clone of that clone. Dev's need to add more incentives for older PVE missions already, just put them on a rotation that pays out double/differently to entice the player base. its not that hard ffs i want to play some earth shaker and HQ!! i could see myself playing this more frequently if you added a quick play button or some kind of rotation for older spec ops. that's all you need to do to drastically improve QOL and the lifetime of the game, maybe do that instead of wasting time and money constantly redesigning crafting and UI?",38.4 hrs on record																					(35.0 hrs at review time),N/A

Gameplay from MP perspective: taking heavily from company of heroes it is your standard RTS streamlined somewhat for quick battles. you will have some points to choose a few special units while the game is starting. theres your HQ and there are two production structures among the three launch factions (russians, polish, germans) these are for your infantry and mech productions. these must be constructed with the engineer unit you will spawn with alongside a scout unit, once the production structures are upgraded once they will unlock the second tier of units for production, iron and oil are required for productions, you will capture nodes on the map for iron and oil (usually not very far away on very claustrophobic maps) which can be upgraded once to increase output. its a tug of war with these nodes and a race to create a few big mechs to go stomping the enemy HQ or holding the victory point flags. infantry movement is similar to company of heroes, green and yellow dots signalling strong and weak cover, the can be faced in a direction, retreated to HQ for reinforcement and come with abilities that instead of purchased can be used if you level them up in combat. units can also pickup equipment on the ground so they can resume the positions of other fallen units. i have not played long enough to have any balancing comments. there is usually one upgrade for one structure and little else to purchase anything other than units, theres no need to make multiple structures as units are made in 5-10 seconds so the pace is fast and furious Other content: it has challenge maps, and custom games can be set up for player v bot not much to comment on here other than the AI on easy basically just let us have everything and didn't make any advanced units until the final moments, its very easy to learn the game from a quick skirmish match vs the ai since there are no complex production trees and upgrades launch comments: complaints are low map count, missing coop and poor MP implementation, all are true however more maps and coop are coming in the next few weeks still undergoing crunch time testing presumably. steam workshop will be on the table in the coming years. personally i'm not too upset but i hope they keep a good pace of updates to placate and maintain the players base and i would also like to see a server browser or party system for matchmaking",14.9 hrs on record																					(2.0 hrs at review time),N/A

The trips needed to advance the story are straight forward and short usually done in about 10 minutes, the cutscenes usually take longer, in proper kojima fashion. come the end of the journey (its supposed to feel like a treacherous journey not an easy stroll) your character will comment as much, he is done with this sh** and so are you. bringing everyone together and unlocking the nuts story is the main driving force and the biggest sense of acheivement in this game comes from using the connections and structures you have made to bring the world together and prevent an extinction event.

Overall the new progress and unlock system really gives you more incentive to play longer hours as its easier to get and upgrade these new and old school characters.

76561198043040051,6,N/A,Recommended,"game only works if you have call of duty 1 installed, otherwise it won't work Do not attempt on veteran mode.. By far the most difficult COD campaign in existence. you play 3 campaigns: USA, UK, and Russia all vs Germany even on Hardened difficulty it took some hours to beat 3 or 4 of the most difficult missions",24.9 hrs on record																					(0.4 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198043040051,6,N/A,Recommended,"Definitely worth getting, lengthy campaign that includes USA, United Kingdoms and Russia storyline's that blend together well - decent amount of weapon options If you've enjoyed playing COD World at War, you'll have no problem getting into this game, most gun models and reload animations are exactly the same in both games, but very different story modes Good music also, definitely fitting the theme of ww2. Btw there is no censorship regarding nazi symbols, in fact it's shown everywhere in the game in most if not all missions, so if that's something that offends you you've been warned. But it's accurate with the history. The only downside to this game, are some technical difficulties. Launching the game doesn't work, unless I do Ctrl+alt+delete and start task manager, and force close Cod. Then the game will launch the second try, and that's a consistent fix for the problem.  The other technical issue, is after closing the game, steam still thinks the game is open adding fake hours to your playtime. And since steam thinks the game is still playing, I couldn't play other games without restarting my computer entirely, if I only restarted Steam it would still think I was playing COD. They were pretty small issues, pretty annoying, however they did have a consistent solution for the issues. besides that, I'd definitely recommend this game for anyone who enjoys world war 2 FPS games",64.7 hrs on record																					(64.3 hrs at review time),N/A
