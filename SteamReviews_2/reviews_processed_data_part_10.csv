As someone who has never played the OG ones thought okay if I start with the worst without playing the best ones I might even like the game. BUT OH MY MY! I had no idea how ♥♥♥♥ this game is! From the very first hour this game felt like a chore. The world design seemed uninspiring, Gunplay felt mediocre at best and the horrendous voice acting & facial expression almost made me puke. Still kept playing hoping for some interesting quest or something but nah they were dull and nothing more than Pressing E & running from one point to another.

Fast forward 1.5 patch, I played this game again for like 10 hours, having finished the main story and side contents before I had nothing to do but to play some gigs n roam around the NC. That is when I realized how empty, unfinished, soul-less it is. I couldn't be forgiving about the bugs n glitches anymore; I mean come on it's been over a year now and this game was advertised for 7 years lmao. I never hated the walking of NPC so much in a game. Even the story which left okayish last year feels like it didn't really have an impact on the city or laws like an RPG game should have.

76561199023634809,3,N/A,Recommended,"I pre-ordered this game on the first day it came out. Since it being a ps exclusive my expectations were running high of this game. I boot up this game as soon as it became available & you know what happens, it crashes in 2 mins. I keep faith & wait , wait forward to it became stable ...fast forward to update 1.05 , I play this game again & ngl I love this game. The character & atmosphere & the story setting feels kinda new . I felt like it would be one of the best game I will play. Now its became one of the unfinished game for me. Why ? cause its simple as much as i enjoyed fighting new machines , it became stale , it didn't feel like fun anymore , constant inventory management , grindy , meaningless npcs , same kinda cut scene settings. All the things I felt would be new wasn't really new . They borrowed heavily from other titles. Everything felt repetitive & there was a moment when I didn't care for even the main protagonist. All these things would have okay if the Story was okay. But sadly it wasn't . i still have 3 missions left in the main story which I dont think I'll ever finish. But still im recommending this game , cause most people seem to love it & i don't want to become an alien telling you not to play it LOL .",44.5 hrs on record																					(1.2 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198068123705,2,N/A,Recommended,Ok normaly I wouldn't have written a review for this software but this community just makes me sick. This is in response to all the negative reviews that popped up because of the 'adware' that it 'installed'. The supposed 'adware' everyone is mentioning was a popup window that informed Borderless Gaming users about a new software called 'Rainway' by the same developer that can litteraly be closed with one click and then would display again at restart of the software. The developer has already stated that this self promotion was supposed to show only once and he has already fixed the continious appearing of the popup. The ad wasn't intrusive and it's not like it's displaying a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of ads in normal use. The loads of negative reviews from users aren't more then a overreaction and just unapropriate for displaying one promotion for a software in which the developer invested much time and that targets the same audience as Borderless gaming which possibly could be intrested in this new software of his THAT AGAIN IS TO 100% FREE.

Because of that almost all forum post etc. you can find online will tell you that you're not able to play in coop before you both have beaten the mission. As of patch 1.14 this was changed and you can now play a mission in coop as long as both players have unlocked the mission.

76561198068123705,3,N/A,Recommended,"If I could only play one game for the rest of my life this would be it! This is easily one of the best FPS games of all time the best game that was ever made in general! The combat is challenging, fun and forces you to think, adapt and try around with your selection of weapons. The visuals and design of the HUGE Black Mesa Research facility are just amazing and in some levels even breath taking. You probably will never find another game with better and more believably designed maps and such a diversity of areas. It's also just amazing how those levels are incorporated into the gameplay experience. Exploring the facility is probably the most fun I ever had in a single player game because you will find nice details, secrets and little parts of the story and universe around every corner. Also for a source engine game that was originally created over 20 years (!) ago the visuals are holding up niceley and are a good fit for modern day games. Especially the visuals of the newly released Xen chapter, which definitely is the least ""true to the original"" recreation of the Half Life maps is visually extremely stunning. The other maps aren't entirely true to the original either but they try to keep the spirit and as much of the map intact as long as it didn't impact the gameplay or visual quality of the map. If you haven't played this game, now is the time! Give it a chance, trust me you won't be disappointed. The only thing that might happen to you is that you suddenly find other modern day games extremely dull in comparision to this materpiece. After all this is a faithful recreation of the original Half Life remade and modernized for the 21th century and, at least for me, a clear 10/10 and a game that everyone should at least experience once to see what made gaming great back in the day. (Hint: It's not the millions of skins and visual customizations you can drop out of loot boxes or DLCs. A principle that every modern game nowadays seems to follow. Oh and it's also not the graphics either even if this game has nice ones as a bonus.)",76.8 hrs on record																					(19.8 hrs at review time),N/A

Warum muss ich hier glaube ich nicht erklären, denn es gibt zu genüge Reviews die das bereits sehr gut tun. Was jedoch anzumerken ist, das Spiel ist ""Free2Play"". Dieser Begriff wird in den meisten eher Misstrauen auslosen, da es in der Vergangenheit genung Spiele gab, die durch dieses Modell Items, etc. für Echtgeld verkauft haben, die z.B. das Balancing dieser Spiele immens verschlechtert haben. PoE merkt man dieses ""Free2Play""-Modell jedoch gar nicht an, und man könnte es ohne Probleme auch für einen Vollpreistitel halten. In den Meisten ""F2P""-Spielen kommt man irgendwann zu dem Punkt, an dem man, ohne Echtgeld auszugeben, einfach nicht mehr weiter kommen kann.

The destruction is now really slow and often takes too long unlike the original.The destruction is also clearly barebone and rushed, If you decide to wipe a town or city, you will be met with poor framerate and thousands of floating props from the buildings you destroyed.. (The original game had no issues like this) Humans can't get anything right anymore, its pathetic. The PK controls have been changed and slaughtered, the physic has been gutted and hollowed out. Throwing objects does feel better although having to rely on the Dpad for most of the other abilities is just awkward. Performance hits the deck the moment you decide to actually destroy buildings and cause mayhem.. you know.. the whole point of the game..

76561198146303292,27,N/A,Recommended,"Operation Northwoods was a proposed false flag operation against the Cuban government that originated within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) of the United States government in 1962. The proposals called for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) or other U.S. government operatives to both stage and actually commit acts of terrorism against American military and civilian targets, blaming them on the Cuban government, and using it to justify a war against Cuba. The possibilities detailed in the document included the possible assassination of Cuban immigrants, sinking boats of Cuban refugees on the high seas, hijacking planes to be shot down or given the appearance of being shot down, blowing up a U.S. ship, and orchestrating violent terrorism in U.S. cities. The proposals were rejected by President John F. Kennedy. Fidel Castro had taken power in Cuba in 1959 and began allowing communists into the new Cuban government, nationalizing US businesses and improving relations with the Soviet Union, arousing the concern of the U.S. military due to the Cold War. The operation proposed creating public support for a war against Cuba by blaming it for terrorist acts that would actually be perpetrated by the U.S. Government. To this end, Operation Northwoods proposals recommended hijackings and bombings followed by the introduction of phony evidence that would implicate the Cuban government. It stated: The desired result from the execution of this plan would be to place the United States in the apparent position of suffering defensible grievances from a rash and irresponsible government of Cuba and to develop an international image of a Cuban threat to peace in the Western Hemisphere.",0.2 hrs on record																					(0.1 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198355865927,2,N/A,Recommended,"Current state of the game isn't what it used to be since it's flooded with sweats and max level people so be prepared to get outgunned in pretty much every gunfight if your low level or don't have the best guns or equipment to use. I can't even count the number of times I shot at someone up close with a point blank shotgun hit or assault rifle (landing all shots) and I still lose the gun fight because the enemy is hopping around every 2 seconds and using an AEK or ACE 23, which are undoubtedly the 2 best guns in the game by far and they still take a considerate about of my playtime to unlock both. Of course, in typical EA fashion, you can just pay your way to unlock everything which defeats one of the main fun aspects of the multiplayer. DICE undoubtedly makes incredible FPS games but EA also finds a way to put their filth in everything they touch. It's also a jump fest because spamming jump and running means your immune to get shot at basically and your aim/accuracy tightens up. Also, playing this version with a controller compared to other versions of the game is a huge letdown and slap in the face because you get zero aim assist and there's no option to put controller icons onto the game so even if your playing with controller, your constantly seeing key bind prompts to do things in the game as if your playing with a keyboard.

Game seems to run better on console unless your playing on an Xbox One then your fps will be super sluggish at a capped 30 fps. Progression is improving but still greatly slow. Ultimately, players should be rewarded on performance and match completion but this still hasn't been added. SBMM is in social game modes including big team battle which is a terrible choice for players like me who already have a high k/d ratio. Every game equals a sweat fest unless the host has a significantly lower k/d ratio than me. Why would you add SBMM in social game playlists when you already have arena and ranked game playlists?!? Also, if you have already played many bot games like majority of people already have in order to grind the battle pass XP and you've been destroying the bots every single game, that will raise your k/d ratio incredibly high. Then once you go to play socials, you'll be playing against the best players in the world since you'll always be matched with similar skill players. Weapons urgently needs balancing fixes, pistol and battle rifle seems like the only viable weapons to kill people. why spend so much emphasis on adding brand new weapons to halo when majority are heavily lacking behind everything else. Same goes for certain vehicles like the wasp, bullets in the wasp do practically nothing majority of the time. At the time of writing this review, i'd give the game a solid 4/10. They did alot right with gameplay mechanics and abilities but overall, the game is a major downgrade in comparison to older halo games or how halo mcc handles its XP progression and matchmaking selection.",3.7 hrs on record,N/A

76561198011248114,1,N/A,Recommended,"Good game, but not as ""realistic"" as the devs claim. SWAT 4 presented more realistic scenarios, the most guys you'd have to fight would be like 5 dudes.  In Ready or Not, you are routinely caught in wall to wall fire fights from all angles by like 50 guys, who are usually just security guards, not armed criminals. (Security guard would probably not fight the police) My main complaint is that as great as this game is, it comes off as total cop porn, depicting SWAT teams as gun-ho action heroes instead of the reality of what the job entails. This is closer to Rainbow Six than the original SWAT. Not really a bad thing, but I feel like it does take something away from the experience. You don't get to pick your entry point, there are no police snipers and as I said, the amount of hostiles is far beyond anything a SWAT team would be called to put down. Ready or Not also doesn't ask the same questions that SWAT does, about proper police procedure. For example, many of the arrest animations, most of which you perform on non-suspects and hostages, might be considered police brutality. (Slapping the person and shoving them to the ground. Not exactly the best way to treat someone whos been taken hostage.) This would be fine, but the game never uses this to make a statement. It just presents it as accepted procedure. SWAT 4 was very nuanced about this sort of thing in a way that these developers don't seem to be. I mean, they are banning people on the forums for making jokes about the ATF or people who mention George Floyd, even in jest. Just reeks of insecurity and an unquestioning obedience to authority. However, where I think the game shines is its atmosphere and the gritty environments. The enemies are some seriously bad people. Not just your usual gang bangers, bank robbers and terrorists. You'll raid sex slave rings, child traffickers, and a crackhouse complete with an ODing baby. Some seriously nasty stuff that borders on horror. Its incredibly violent, which is another plus. On at least one level, a suspect blows his head off rather than be taken down. The Nightclub shooting is filled with gory bodies and the mansion raid has some incredibly confronting scenes involving child murder. Definitely not a game for the faint of heart, but in this sense, I think it does depict the nature of inhumanity that humans often display to each other.",108.7 hrs on record																					(5.2 hrs at review time),N/A

Not terrible all things considered, but feels a bit half baked. Game is almost designed for coop but there is no coop option, like the game was released before that could be implemented. Looks good for a handheld game, though looks much worse than Resident Evil 5 which came out years earlier. Mostly a fun campaign with a contrived and confusing plot. Would have been better if everything just took place on the ship but instead the game has you bounce all over the place playing as different characters in different locations. Absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ final boss. Seriously, one of the worst sonsofbitches I've ever had to try and put down. So cheap and irritating.

Interesting setting and engaging story, though perhaps not told as well as it could have been. Big exposition dumps are a little bit disappointing.  Introduction of the story seems rushed, with a big dump almost right at the start. The game doesn't want you to ease into the story at all. However, definitely better writing than the studio's next game, Life is Strange. (That's some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ student film level ♥♥♥♥.) The story is basically Total Recall, but without Mars. The idea is that the MegaCorporation is using their memory technology to control the populace, something that wasn't really touched upon in that particular story.  You are Nillen, a resistance member fighting against a faceless corporation. You have your memories wiped and have to regain them. Loyalties and convictions are constantly put into question. Simple stuff, but it works well for what it is. There are enough differences that it is not on the nose, and this game does it's own thing with it. It's a game that's not in anyway great, but its also not a bad game either. And, I wouldn't even call it average, generic, or unmemorable (Like so many internet comedians have said before). I think it's a good game, it's pretty fun and has some very memorable visuals. But it's a game that frequently comes short at reaching its full potential.  For example this is a game where you are a person who has the power to change people's memories, and manipulate them this way. That's the premise of your character.Really cool, huh? Except you do this very rarely in the game. This really should have something you did towards the end of every level. Great boss fights and compelling characters. I love Madame, the Dominatrix Prison Warden of the Neo Bastille Prison. You fight her in like a VR simulation that looks incredibly cool. Everything makes use of a blocky augmented reality effect. The design of the city and environments is really cool and interesting. Neo Paris is not just a generic Blade Runner rip off, it looks unique, and in some aspects the game's environments remind me of Mirror's Edge. The universe of this game is straight out of a Phillip K ♥♥♥♥ novel. Apart from the obvious Total Recall and Blade Runner connections, the augmented reality advertising reminds me a lot of Minority Report. There are hints of Asimov in the way that the robots are treated as well. The city also has just the tiny touch of inspiration from the movie The Fifth Element and the French comic Valerian. Not much exploration, the levels seem way more linear than something like Tomb Raider 2013. The ""secrets"" are pretty easy to find and most of the time you'll stumble across them by accident. This game builds a great world but you never get the option to really explore it. I don't want it to be open world, but I would like levels to be more open ended.

76561198011248114,1,N/A,Recommended,"Dead By Daylight with Predators and Guns A simple yet fun game. The first non AVP related Predator game since Concrete Jungle is an asymmetrical First Person Shooter/Stealth multiplayer game. Four players play as a team of commandos while a fifth player plays the predator. The commandos have to complete a series of objectives against AI enemies while being hunted by the predator. To win, they have to successfully complete their mission and exfiltrate or alternatively, they can kill the predator. The predator simply has to kill the fireteam before they can escape. Easy to learn, hard to master. Progressing through the fireteam also unlocks new gear for the predator, and I would advise you start this way, as the predator is next to useless with the starting gear. Lots of customization, but a little grindy. Singeplayer against bots is bare bones and does not support AI for the predator team. I would like to see this fixed soon to improve the games longivity.

It is, exactly the same game, built from the ground up in the same engine. It has all the same strengths and all the same faults that the original had back in the day. Much of the early 2000s jank has been carried over too, for better or worse. That said, even without the graphics update, the gameplay has aged incredibly well, which shows just how great of a game the original was. Some elements do show the games age, such as the reasonably empty open world with lack of any real side quests. However, this is something that would change in the sequel. Everything is destructable, given you're in the flying saucer. There isn't really much of a plot, other than it basicly being Mars Attacks the video game. You're sent to earth after the Roswell crash to prevent the humans for gathering your alien DNA, but after that, it kind of just starts being about you progressively eliminating the US's leadership until eventually you've disintergrated and impersonated the president of the United States.",10.6 hrs on record																					(10.5 hrs at review time),N/A

The game also incorporates elements of Prometheus into the story and gameplay in a way that's better than anything Ridley Scott could have done. A fun, lovingly crafted game that isn't without a few flaws. The amount of lore and care that went into this game is a testament to the fact that it was crafted by fans of the franchise and not just cynical devs looking to make a buck. The campaign has you fighting mostly the iconic xenomorphs, but a few missions will see you up against Weyland-Yutani combat andriods and black goo mutants to change things up. There's a bunch of weapons to unlock, and the fact that many of them can be bought means that the games progression is not as grindy as many of its contemporaries. Perhaps a little too easy on the standard difficulty, you might want to play this on something harder. The Challenge Card mechanic, which makes matches harder or easier depending on the effect, is an interesting addition that reminds me of the skulls in Halo. Once the campaign is completed the first time, you unlock several different game types including a horde mode that resembles Gears of War. However, these only feature the xenomorphs and I wish there were options to choose between the aliens, androids or the mutant creatures just for some variety. The robots and xenomorphs are fun to fight, but the mutants are a little stale. Effectively, they are just zombies, and the smaller ones resemble flood from Halo or headcrabs from Half Life. Kind of irritating, but they aren't in enough levels of the game for it to truly be a complaint. 85% of the time, you are fighting aliens.

It's a great game, though I'm still not the biggest fan of rogue-like games, I managed to have fun with this one, because it offers a more arcadey experience. It even has four player split screen, which any PC game deserves credit for doing. If anyone doesn't remember Road Rash, it was a fun combat racer game on the Nintendo 64 (and maybe the Playstation as well) where you hit other bikers with baseball bats and clubs. This time, the emphasis is staunchly on the combat, not so much on the racing, but if you are like me and are more into vehicular combat, then you should definitely pick this up. Unlike the original game, Road Redemption adds in bombs and guns, which I think make everything much more fun. Set in Post Apocalyptic Australia, the game is obviously a massive love letter to Mad Max.

Graphics have aged incredibly well, apart from the facial animations and human models, which look plastic and barely move their lips in time to the voice lines. Maybe that will be fixed in the remaster. Alan Wake is a better Alone in The Dark game than the last one that Atari dropped around the same time. You fight enemies who are essentially resident evil zombies, but instead of being undead, they are living humans possessed by darkness and called ""The Taken"". To kill the Taken you have to use light to weaken them, then finish them off with a gun. Flares and flash bangs are very useful, as are environmental items like explosive barrels. Very Lynchian and meta. Lots of hidden TVs with an interesting Twilight Zone parody in most levels, like the original Max Payne. The voice of Max Payne himself appears in a little easter egg that hints towards where Remedy wanted to end that franchise. A must for horror game enthusiasts. Crime writer Alan Wake, suffering from writers block, arrives in the town of Bright Falls with his wife Alex for a vacation. But in the quiet mountain mining town, they soon find a nightmare instead. An ancient darkness looms over Bright Falls, one which blurs the line between fiction and reality. Wake finds the pages of a manuscript that he has never written.

Mostly a first impression as I am only up to the third planet - But I have been doing as many side missions as possible. This game is from Josh Sawyer and the same team at Obsidian that brought us New Vegas, and it is very much a worthy successor to it. The shooting and combat feels alot like Fallout 4, which is a good thing because I think most people agree that combat was one of the only good aspects of that game. The RPG system is simplifed enough to engage the great unwashed, but not dumbed down too much for veteran RPG players. There is even a VATS-esque system, which basicly amounts to bullet time. Even the games Luna Boy mascot is extremely similar to Vault Boy. Gameplay wise the game does nothing new, but it is more than the sum of its parts. The writing doesn't quite reach the highs of New Vegas, but its universe - Hitchhiker's Guide meets Firefly by way of Futurama - Is very much appealing. The idea that the future is this Douglas Adams inspired bureaucratic nightmare was a great satrical touch. The game has a much lighter tone than Fallout - However the Libertarian dystopia that it depicts is not a terribly attractive one - Unlike the games visuals that are brillant even when not on the highest settings. Some of the weapon drops seem RNG, though I am not certain this is completely the case. There are some things it could do better. The companion system is worse than the standard unmodded New Vegas. You can't get them to wait anywhere which is a ♥♥♥♥♥ for stealth runs when you dont want to go at it completely solo. You also can't remove headgear that you put on them. This is one of the most idiotic and mind boggling choices in game design I've ever seen. It even appears that the developers were aware of this oversight - So instead of fixing it, they give you an option in the settings to unshow the headgear for all companions. This is not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ solution.  There is also no Third Person option - even though you have a character model. It almost seems like this was something they didnt get time to implement.

Developed by John Romero (Doom, Quake) and Brenda Romero (Wizardry) Pretty addicting Turn Based Strategy Game with RPG elements. No idea what all the negative reviews are about. The game is much better than expected. The first Empire Builder I've played where I didn't immediately crash the economy. You run around, take over peoples rackets and replace them with your own. You can build breweries, speakeasies, brothels, casinos or hotels. If you have enough gang members, you can build a safehouse and assign a lieutenant to it. There are 14 gang leaders to choose from. Some are real like Dean O'Bannon, Stephanie St Clair and Al Capone, but others are fictional characters created for the game. There is a pretty even mix of male and female bosses, which doesn't seem too forced as there were plenty of real women bootleggers in real life. Some of the gangs are themed around particular rackets and will excel best with that kind of business. Alot of the negative reviews come from people who don't understand how the economy works. You are bootleggers. That means, you have to bootleg. Build breweries and sell top grade liquor to minor factions and rival gangs. Use the funds you earn to crush them. This is what Al Capone did. This is what Arnold Rothstein did. I don't understand how people could get this wrong. If you just keep buying rackets, you'll tank the economy. The best way to expand is to kill the boss of a rival gang. You earn all of their rackets for the cost of one safehouse. There are some issues that I have, but nothing major. When you attack a building, your guys just scramble to their nearest ""cover"", even if it puts them in a worse position than if they did nothing. This is very annoying sometimes. There's no diplomatic way to play the game. You can't really absorb other gangs.  I also wish you could run legitimate businesses too, like Butcher shops or pizza parlours. Could use more customisation for the gang members (What clothes they can wear, ect). I would like to see these things added in the expansion. UPDATE: The Precinct Update and the Make It Count DLC greatly expand the gameplay and improve many of the features of the game. Gang Turfs now have supply lines that must exist in order for you to invade. Diplomacy is now a valid option with the ability to peacefully buy out a rival's empire. Police response and presence is greatly improved. This update is free and includes mod support. Make It Count adds ""Not Meyer Lensky"" due to some legal issues with Hollywood and Loansharking.

You can create your own creatures and build your own armies from DNA you find in the campaign. There are two resources: Coal and Power. They are few and fair between. The game is very challenging, as you can easily cripple yourself economically and the AI has a tendency to spam turrets. The campaign and story is very tongue in cheek and never takes itself too seriously. Its entertaining enough. But the game is best played in small doses. After you get over the initial gimmick, you find that the game doesn't have a lot more to offer. In a way, the games unit variety also gives it a lack of variety. Because all the units are animals, eventually they all kind of feel the same. Sure, there are air units and sea units as well, but I cant help but think they all feel kinda samey.

Clearly inspired by the art of Simon Stalenhag, the game is set in a unique Nordic Post-Cyberpunk world, where after ""The Collapse"", all CPUs and robots have been outlawed world wide, in a law called ""The Third Decree"". Humanity now relies upon Nanotechnology in place of computers. In a far future Scandinavia, given as ""80 AR"" - In the year of the collapse - augmented Central Bureau Agent Vera Englund arrives in the quiet town of Nordsund - a village built in the sky, over the shadow of the old world, where computers are a thing of the past - to solve a series of bloody murders. The routine investigation quickly becomes something far more sinister, as Vera unravels a conspiracy to merge Artificial Intelligence with humans to create a Machine God among men. Multiple outcomes imply that the game's short length is supplemented by increased replay value. Worth it for the setting and great pixel art alone. Cool soundtrack, Nordic folk music mixed with futuristic synth. Very few games take on the unquiet concept of ""Post-Cyberpunk"" - a vision of what the world would be like after a Low Life, High Tech future. In comparison, the future presented here is very Low Tech, High Life. People seem to be happier than they were in the world before, but architecture and culture have become much more archaic as a result - for better or worse, everybody here seems to live in lavish stone halls that resemble the Viking Kingdoms of old.

Rockstar again showing they are the only western dev who can deliver a truly gritty crime game. L.A Noire absolutely smashed Mafia 2 back in 2011 as the best Noir game that year. Great game, average port. Really bad draw distance and pop in. Shadows look rough even on highest settings. Controller supported but non re-bindable. It does seem to run well, although sometimes hard crashes when you quit the game. It's an action adventure that's light on the action part, heavy on the adventure. Most of the shootouts and gunplay occur in side missions. This isn't GTA in the 40s. The world is only semi open and you can't pull your gun out when not in a fight. That being said, the shooting and driving feel like a more refined GTA IV. It's the kind of game David Cage would make if he made actual games that had real gameplay. Most of the game is based around collecting clues and dialogue options. If you don't like that kind of game, you won't like this. Follow 1940's Police Officer Cole Phelps as he rises through the ranks of the LAPD. First as a patrolman, then as a detective.

Follow Max Payne into his seediest, darkest tale yet; Ten years after the events of Max Payne 2, Max has been discharged from the police force for colluding with known criminals. We catch up with him at rock bottom; his addictions and his grief have now both completely consumed him. Disgraced, he spends his days unhappily retired, drowning his sorrows at a Hoboken dive bar, in-between popping bottles of Painkillers, in an attempt to heal the wounds made deep inside him all those years ago. That is until, during a bar-fight, he kills he boss of New Jersey's only son. Once again on the run from the Mafia, but now without his badge, Max turns to a colleague from his days at the Police Academy for help. Fleeing to Brazil, Max begins working VIP security for a wealthy family, The Brancos, part of the Sao Paulo political elite.

Junky, awkward shooting. Really bad driving. I mean, really bad. Sleeping Dogs has worse driving, but thats about it. Apparently people really like grappling hooks and parasailing, because thats all this game has got going for it. It gets old quickly, espically today. The game sure hasn't aged well. I played more of this game back on 360. I didnt like it then, and I don't like it now. It runs well, if memory serves. Much better than some other open world games of it's era. Nothing special, unless you really have a thing for open world games. Also, the plot is basicly CIA propaganda with little nuance, commentary or satire. It doesn't take its self too seriously, but the plot never stops to acknowledge that destablizaing countries because you don't agree with their politics is always a bad idea.

Are you a fan of horror lore, stealth games or First Person RPGs that aren't just an FPS with some numbers and stats thrown in? If you answered ""Yes"" to all these questions, you need to get this game. An excellent introduction to the World of Darkness setting and one of the best Role Playing Video Games ever made. Not to mention, the very first game to use the source engine. The combat is mostly stat based, but the game does use hitboxes. Shooting will feel spongy unless you put points into Fire-Arms. There is a Third Person camera view, but I find it mostly cumbersome outside of the melee combat, where the game will only ever use a Third Person view. I like this, because melee in 2000 shooters was always very clunky. The combat is still a little clunky here, but it certainly feels better than something like Morrowind. The shooting is mostly fine provided you have enough puts in the skill, but the shotgun always plays the full reload animation even if you only load in one round. I found it easier to switch weapons than reload it when being rushed because of this. However, there is actually very little combat in this game, in comparison to the amount of story and role playing going on. This game really builds its world and often times its best just to put points into stealth and go that route. You are a vampire after all. Best played with mods. The Unoffical Patch and Clan Quest are great ones to start with. There are various graphical enhancements and texture packs listed on the Nexus and mod DB that vastly improve the games visuals.

BloodRayne is a Third Person Shooter that combines elements of the Hack & Slash genre. That makes it kind of a rare combination, rarely seen besides the likes of ""Space Marine"". BloodRayne and it's sequel are like the ""Little Sister"" of Max Payne, and also are some of the few games that built upon it's format without simply copying it. This franchise was massive once in the early 2000s. Some people thought it would be the next ""Tomb Raider', but it has sadly since mostly faded into obscurity. Probably because of the Uwe Boll movies. Very unfair. You play as Rayne, a damphir (A human-vampire hybrid, like Blade) as she hunts Nazis in the 1930s trying to unleash a Lovecraftian horror upon the world. The first hour or so is a little tough to get through, but once you start fighting Nazis the game is just wall to wall fun. Cut off their limbs and see them run around screaming in agony as blood spurts from their wound until they bleed out. This game is gory and violent even by today's standards. The gore reminds me heavily of the classic stealth horror ""Manhunt"". Another forgotten classic. Some parts of it hasn't aged well, like the platform sections in the start. Also, I wish the game would give you the option to swap around what pistols you want to use, as you quite often end up using different guns in each hand.

76561198011248114,4,N/A,Recommended,"With Grand Theft Auto IV, the series takes a step into a grittier narrative and the definitive version of the game is The Complete Edition, which completes the games overarching narrative with the two expansions The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony. See the gritty underbelly of Liberty City from the eyes of three very different men; Niko Bellic, a Serbian immigrant with a dark past who has come to America to flee a figure from his past and find the American Dream with his cousin, Roman, who owns a Taxi Company and is indebted to Russian mobsters. Johnny Klebbitz, the Vice President of The Lost M.C, an outlaw motocycle gang who has been looking after the club while it's President, the unhinged Billy Grey, has been in prison. And Luis Lopez, the bodyguard of mafia connected nightclub owner ""Gay"" Tony Prince, who himself has ties to Dominican Street gangs, and must dodge bullets to protect his crocked boss. The three stories interwine and overlap and a way I recommend playing it is it switch to one of them when one of the other characters is introduced. The story flows alot better this way, and you can see it was kind of a prototype for GTA V. Grand Theft Auto IV is the series at it's highest, though it is not without its flaws.  The driving feels like all the cars are on ice, though this is easily fixed with a simple mod. The old radio songs have been replaced by Rockstar due to copyright reasons, but this can also be fixed, and in a way where all three games use all the radios and songs together, meaning it actually makes the game ironically better. Then, in the main game there are the annoying phone call activities you need to do at the most inconvenient times or you lose access to abilities like having Roman call you a cab or Little Jacob selling you guns out of his car.

76561198011248114,4,N/A,Recommended,"Very interesting instalment in the adventures of the world's number one assassin Agent 47. Hitman Contracts, which is the third Hitman game, is the most underrated game in the Hitman series. Everyone mentions Blood Money and Silent Assassin, which are great games, but Hitman Contracts has this Max Payne film noir atmosphere in every mission. The entire game takes place at night and in the rain. It's easily got one of the best plots in the series and the mission ""Deadly Cargo"" in Hitman: Contracts has to be one of the best missions in the game. Most of the missions are remakes of ones from the first game, others are set before then while some are set during next game, making it a weird blend of a sequel, a prequel and a remake. The first time around the game does not allow you to pick your own equipment, but on your next playthrough you can start with whatever weapons you have unlocked. This makes it the only Hitman game apart from Absolution where you can't choose your load out. Might be a deal breaker for some. The plot is a favourite of mine: After a botched job in Paris (Depicted in the sequel Blood Money), Agent 47 is shot and left for dead in a dilapidated hotel. Bleeding out, with the law closing in around him, 47 remembers contracts from his past, as he passes in and out of consciousness. Elements of his subconscious bleed into the reality of his memories; the missions play out in a nightmarish dream world of perpetual night, where the halls are haunted by the phantoms of the many lives he has ended.",2.4 hrs on record																					(2.3 hrs at review time),N/A

It takes all the best elements of Absolution and blends them with the best elements of Blood Money. While I liked Absolution, it was certainly the weakest in the series.

Pros: -Replaybility -Customization -Immersive enviroments -Weapon and death variety -Endless play style possibilities -Manual saves instead of checkpoints (Never put checkpoints in a stealth game) -Graphics and optimization, (game looks great even on low settings) Cons: -Episodic structure (I waited till all the levels were released before buying because Square Enix can go f**k themselves) -No Human shields (A staple since Blood Money) -Lack of variety in voice acting (Same few actors, all with either British, American or Australian accents, no matter what location you are in-game) -Some of the gun sound effects are lacking, the assault rifles and SMGs sound like toys -Relatively short story (Only 6 levels + 4 Bonus missions that just use the same locations, here's to hoping for a season 2)",157.6 hrs on record																					(41.5 hrs at review time),N/A

It certainly feels much more like a Tomb Raider game, there is way more tombs to raid.  I've raided about ten Tombs and there's still plenty I have yet to do. It has way better stealth mechanics than the last game and while there are still forced combat sections they are done way better than the original, in that you aren't locked into some arena where you have to fight off waves of enemies. The open world is better than it was in the first game but it still feels very ""game like"" and is more linear than I would have liked. It's story is an improvement over the original and certainly has a more Tomb Raider feel to it, but I feel as though Lara's character has been somewhat weakened by the fact that her only motivation is her deceased father. I actually found it kind of annoying that almost every line of dialogue she had was her whining about her father's research. I know Lara's parents have always been a driving force in the series but this game takes it a bit too far. The villians in this game are great, espically the main antagonist Konstantin, who has stigmata scars on his hands and suffers from a god complex.

This game has an interesting premise but so far, for me anyway, an 18 year old male who's finished high school, the execution so far leaves alot to be desired. I hadn't heard of this game until it came out, and I watched the trailers and thought  ""Hey, this looks kind of cool, it's like Brick mixed with Donnie Darko with a female protagonist"". It's more like Juno mixed with Donnie Darko at this point. Except without the pregnant main character. Essentially, you play as a female photography student in her late teens who discovers she has the abillity to reverse time. There are good characters in this game, and there are characters that appear to have some personality and actual problems, but so far the ""le wrong generation"" time traveling hipster you play as isn't one of them. Maybe that's the point and I just don't get this game. There hasn't been much plot so far, just alot of foreshadowing and character development. It's obvious that there is something not quite right going on here but we aren't told too much. That's not the problem. There's nothing wrong in having your plot take awhile to unravel. Introducing  your characters and your world through normal interraction and conversation (Well, normal considering you can find out what someone wants to hear and go back in time and tell them that), but it's not fun when every character has some kind of issue that's instantly apparent. There's the girl whos nudes have appeared online and shes bullied for it, the girl whos pregnant, the girl whos boyfriend is cheating on her, the girl whos step dad hits her. As said above, these people do have real issues. I'm not saying these people should just suck it up. What I'm saying is the writers shouldn't make every character you meet so miserable. Like I said, maybe this is because I'm an 18 year old male who doesn't go on tumblr and doesn't dress like someone from the 90s and I just don't ""get"" this game. But so far, to me anyway, it's a lot of wasted potentional. That said, there's still four more episodes to go, and I plan to play every one. Maybe it will get better. I'm hoping it does, because it's premise does still have me intrigued. [EDIT] I couldn't bring myself to play anymore of this game so I watched the rest of it on YouTube. It doesn't get better.
