76561198828810593,1,Psycho Patrol R,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Early Access",Recommended,"Tbh its peak. Love the game so much after 18 hours, the out of mech combat is peak and very terrifying but the mech combat feels too weak early game as you can die from a gust of wind. Definitely way to little of hand holding as some core mechanics you wont even care or know about no matter how important cause theres no explanation or hint for them. But seriously as a early access and day one release this game is solid with no bugs or anything too negative. Its hell too figure out at first but i enjoyed it for that and its a breath of fresh air for that with how many moments of happiness i had figuring stuff out. A complaint i do have though is the game so far feels pretty short for 40$ as i feel if you figure stuff out quick you can get it done in like 10-12 hours so i would of made it 25$. In the future i think ville will definitely make this beyond peak with patches though.",39.4 hrs on record																					(17.8 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198336656213,1,Citizen Sleeper,"Adventure, Indie, RPG",Recommended,"A short and sweet game bustling with love, care, and lore that takes at most 10 hours to complete in a single run with most of the endings if you're thorough. Played at native 4K 120 fps with HDR via Special K. ---------------------------------- Gameplay: 9/10 - I went into this game with somewhat low expectations for the dice roll system but came to enjoy it quite a bit! The system is simple but encourages taking the occasional risk, especially earlier in the game first starting out. It felt like the class specialization doesn't have much of an effect once you reach the mid- and late-game drives where you're mostly upgraded. Story: 9.5/10 - Every drive (gameplay objective) in this game is emotionally and thoughtfully investing and really immerses you into the world. Hours will go by without even knowing. ""Just one more cycle"". I loved and cared about every single character I met in the game, although it does kind of suck that once you finish some drives, some of those characters just disappear into the void with no further interactions. I do wish I could see what they were up to or with some recurring dialogue. Graphics: 9.5/10 - The ship is beautifully rendered in 3D along with the vast emptiness of space. HDR really takes it up a notch with better highlights and colors, but it still looks good in the normal SDR presentation as well. All the characters are beautifully hand drawn and I wish we could see some sort of animated work with them sometime. I loved seeing a character's sprite pop up for dialogue; it's honestly my favorite part about this game. Music and sound design: 10/10 - A masterpiece of melancholic, electronic ambient music. The way the score times itself in conversations to certain gameplay events, hearing a new motif every cycle you wake up, it's all gorgeously choreographed and strongly evoking. I can't describe the shivers of finally reaching the end and hearing the last song, immediately thinking, ""I don't want this to be over yet."" The sound effects for the gameplay loop are equally satisfying for the dice roller. Replayability: 7.5/10 - I definitely would want to go back in to redo some drives and see what I missed along the way. In fact, I did and was as equally satisfied with it as I was my first playthrough. I am eagerly looking forward to the episodic DLC content, but would also love to see other characters' storylines get extended depending on certain gameplay decisions.",16.1 hrs on record																					(16.0 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198336656213,1,A Plague Tale: Innocence,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"One of the most beautiful games of the last console generation that makes some of the best use of megapixel scans I've seen. This game is worth a play for the visuals alone, and the excellent story is icing on the cake. Played at native 4K, all high settings with HDR via Special K. ---------------------------------- Gameplay: 7.5/10 - Slow but fluid gameplay with not much to say. I played with controller and found no troubles using the default controls. Aim assist is extremely strong as Amicia's sling basically requires headshots or fine aim on torches. Stealth is fine and very hold-your-hand. Story: 9/10 - Amazing desolate atmospheres, landscapes and fine detail. The rats are extremely gross and unsettling, and I loved their implementation. Amicia and Hugo's story definitely reminds me of The Last of Us and God of War (2018) but with a much more serious and dark tone, executed greatly. Graphics: 9.5/10 - Utilizing Quixel Megascans, this game features some of the most real and immersive graphics I've seen yet. Nowhere near the uncanny valley all the environments look pulled straight out of a painting. Facial animations are quite stiff unfortunately, and sell some of the story elements quite short. A shame this game did not get updated to have native HDR as it does on the consoles. Music and sound design: 7.5/10 - The rapid and overwhelming squeaks of rats plague the entire game and keeps you sucked into the game. I played the game in the French dub and the voice actors were all fantastic. The soundtrack was great although not too memorable outside of the main motif. Replayability: 5/10 - There's some collectibles and optional mission objectives that could warrant going back into some levels with the level select feature, but overall this game was very much one-and-done. Level select does not carry over progression from later levels.",12.3 hrs on record,N/A
76561198336656213,1,DEATHLOOP,Action,Recommended,"A great immersive sim experience, but burdened by its requirement to make your own fun for a good experience. Played at 1440p + AMD FSR 1.0 to 4K, Digital Foundry optimized RT settings using an AMD RX 6800 XT, Ryzen 5900X and 32 GB RAM; also previously played to completion on PS5. ---------------------------------- Gameplay: 9/10 - Tight and responsive controls that benefit greatly from keyboard versatility and mouse precision. Story: 9/10 - Great atmosphere, twists and turns if you closely follow along text documents and audio logs. The voice performance for both Colt and Julianna are amazing and were a big part of the reason for how much I love this game. Graphics: 7 without RT, 8.5 with RT /10 - Looks a little plain without RT, but benefits greatly if your GPU can handle it. If you liked the Dishonored art style, you will most likely enjoy this game's. The addition of per-object motion blur helps sell the flair and style of Colt's movement. The HDR implementation is also great if you have a supporting display. Music and sound design: 9/10 - Gun sounds aren't anything special, but the world sound design and effects fit the atmosphere perfectly. The soundtrack sounds exactly like what I would've wanted in a game like this, and I immediately wanted to buy a vinyl of the soundtrack upon finishing the game; it is oozing with inspirations from 007, noir, and jazz. Replayability: 10/10 - If you enjoy making your own fun, learning level layouts and enemy positioning for challenge runs, this game executes it brilliantly. Once you're feeling satisfied with taking down the visionaries, you can take on the role of Julianna to ruin other players' days. ---------------------------------- DEATHLOOP is a great addition to the immersive sim genre, and fits in nicely as a must-play game for fans of Deus Ex, the Dishonored series, and Prey (especially if you liked Prey: Mooncrash). I originally finished this game and acquired all the achievements on PS5, and wanted to take on the mantle of Colt once again with the precision of mouse and keyboard, as the controller was just alright and not quite as responsive as I would've liked. With playing on PC, access to ray tracing and the upcoming AMD FSR 2.0 allows the game to truly shine at high framerates. Not quite a roguelike, DEATHLOOP proposes repeating the same day over and over again, acquiring new abilities and expanding your arsenal to take on the next loop, hopefully to break it. Though, you are not alone in your quest to break the loop: Julianna is out for your blood. All it takes is one perfect day; but, how long it takes for you to reach that day depends on your prowess and detective skills. Brilliant performances by Jason E. Kelley and Ozioma Akagha make up most of the voices you will hear in DEATHLOOP, preceding Colt's level entrances, and yet their narrative-developing banter is memorable up through the very end of the game. If you aren't someone who enjoys the ""perfection"" aspect of a game (like Hitman), DEATHLOOP may not be for you, and that's OK. While the levels do change based on your actions from earlier in the loop, their overall structure is largely the same. There have also been comments on the AI being a little too stupid (recent patches have made them smarter, but not too smart) and I would agree, though it did not affect my enjoyment of the game too much. Julianna invasions also can be annoying based on the loadout she spawns in with, but with some skill you are still able to elude her. If you find real players to possibly be a little too difficult, you can also play in offline mode to have an AI Julianna instead. Unraveling the story of DEATHLOOP and finding out how it connects to the greater Arkane universe was one of my favorite parts of the game. I really appreciate the developers making puzzle solutions unique to every player, so while you can look up how to solve a puzzle if you are stuck, you will not be spoonfed the numeric codes or symbols. Even with guides, solving puzzles is immensely satisfying, as well as running into side stories that can take upwards of a whole loop to solve on their own.",18.0 hrs on record																					(17.4 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198336656213,1,Days Gone,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"Days Gone is an underrated former PlayStation exclusive, and stands as a great reason to see more console exclusives come to PC. Maybe we could get a sequel! (Played at 4K, max settings using an AMD RX 6800 XT, Ryzen 3800X and 32 GB RAM) This review is based on a complete, blind playthrough on Normal difficulty. Gameplay: 7/10 - Good, standard feeling gunplay mechanics slightly hindered by repetition. Story: 7.5/10 - A slightly unique take on the zombie apocalypse genre, with the later-game story elements really taking the prize. Some parts of the early third act felt a little slow. Graphics: 8/10 - Visually great and well optimized UE4 performance. My card doesn't break a sweat nor drop frames fighting large late-game hordes at 4K 60 fps. Music and sound design: 7/10 - You hear a lot of the same freaker noises over the course of one playthrough. The sound effects are nothing special, but the world sound is great and accurately represents the spirit of the PNW. Replayability: 5/10 - I'm not particularly fond of replaying large, open world games, but the game does have a NG+ mechanic that seems to be available immediately after starting the game. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone, even at full price. The game does feel hampered in some aspects, especially the survival elements (filling up gas, repairing the bike, etc.) where it feels like the developers wanted to do more but were restricted by budgets or scheduling. The character and world design were inspired and well-executed. Deacon St. John is a great character that never felt like a self-insert, but rather I was controlling a character with his own desires, concerns, and motives. His relationship with Boozer and other characters along the way are expertly crafted, and even his open world dialogue constantly made me wonder about how he was as a character in between the time of the prologue and main story. The main story itself was overall enjoyable and well written, though the vanilla ending may leave some people unsatisfied as, to me, it felt a little abrupt. HOWEVER, if you play this game, be sure to complete the epilogue missions! I won't say much as to why, but you will be missing out on some story bombs if you don't.",53.8 hrs on record,N/A
76561198336656213,1,DESOLATE,"Action, Adventure, RPG",Recommended,"This game feels like a generic horror survival asset flip. (Played at 1440p, high settings using an AMD RX 6800 XT, Ryzen 3800X and 32 GB RAM) Gameplay: 5/10 - Finicky hit-boxes and unresponsive melee combat make the game feel very sluggish. Story: 6/10 - Interesting concept but slow progression constantly hindered by lackluster gameplay. Graphics: 6.5/10 - Visually, it looks good. Artistically, it's uninspired. Music and sound design: 5/10 - Generic horror sounds, mediocre voice over work. Replayability: 3/10 - Dying is not punishing, but rather annoying. I received Desolate as part of June 2021's Humble Choice. Granted, this game is $6 at the time I am reviewing it, I would still not recommend it at that price. This game feels like an early access asset flip using UE4. Multiplayer is functional, but does not incorporate any of the multiplayer elements in the story, as all ""cutscenes"" and voice overs come from your character's mouth, even if one of the other players in the lobby triggers it. The game feels unpolished given the wildly unresponsive ""melee"" combat, guns feel useless, and the inventory menu leaves much to be desired. I had multiple occurrences in which my left and right mouse clicks just stopped working for melee combat, and I tried to use the ""unstuck"" button to respawn my character nearby to see if it would fix it. Nope! It teleported me BACK to the starting area nearly 2000 meters away from my friends. To top it all off, my melee inputs still didn't work! I had to restart my game and join back in order for it to work again, and still make the journey back to my friends starting from the spawn building, as leaving and rejoining the lobby does not save your character's last position, only their inventory. This happened to me FOUR times in <2 hours of play time. I stopped playing after reaching the first colonized settlement on the island, which is really where the lackluster VO stood out the most. Many of the characters seem like they should be Russian due to their name or way they talk, but they are voiced by seemingly amateur Americans reading off of a script. Even with the game's ""mysteries and unsolved questions,"" the slow pace and clunky mechanics did not encourage me at all to want to seek answers, rather, just work from objective-to-objective to fix workbenches and follow the main story. The world does not feel alive at all due to the static patrol routes and spawn points of enemies, and lack of interaction between me, the player, and environment. Jump scare points are also baked in, so you will be bound to encounter the same human enemies, creatures, and scares multiple times in a single session if you die and have to return to your last location, or re-enter buildings for loot. Dying, at least in the beginning part of the game, respawns you in the starting ""room"" in which you walk towards an elevator to ascend to the surface. You have 10 minutes to retrieve your dropped loot, else it disappears. I've heard from my friends that the more you die, the more the room deteriorates, but I personally did not see it happen, maybe because I had to constantly restart my game due to other issues. Having to walk everywhere combined with my grievances with the spawn system discussed above is frankly just annoying and not enjoyable at all. Overall, I would not recommend this game for someone itching for horror survival. There are many better options out there.",1.9 hrs on record																					(1.9 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198336656213,1,Horizon Zero Dawn™ Complete Edition,"Action, Adventure, RPG",Recommended,"Wow, I really don't know what to say. I guess my only wish would've been to be able to play this game sooner. (Played at native 4K, optimized ""max"" settings using an AMD RX 6800 XT, Ryzen 3800X and 32 GB RAM) Gameplay: 9/10 - A satisfying blend of open-world RPG mechanics with the fluidity of more confined experiences like Tomb Raider. Story: 9/10 - A multitude of twists and turns that does a brilliant job of drip-feeding lore about the game's universe. A story that captivated me until the very end. Graphics: 9.5/10 - I was blown away set piece after set piece. Music and sound design: 8.5/10 - The soundtrack joy to explore to, and did a wonderful job at accentuating crucial points during the story. The game is weighed down by unfortunately badly compressed voice over work. Replayability: 7/10 - I personally do not find much interest in replaying large-scale open-world games like these, but the NG+ mechanic is very well done. I 100%ed both base game and Frozen Wilds content and was very satisfied. There is really not much else to say besides that Horizon Zero Dawn is a masterpiece. I am really quite at a loss for words to describe how much of an absolute joy this game was to experience. I originally played a little bit of it on the PS4 Pro and was a little let down by the 30 FPS cap on console, and being able to play it on PC at higher settings and at 60 FPS, minimum, only made the game better. Guerrilla Games has done a spectacular job at blending a post-apocalyptic, tribal, and cybernetic future setting altogether into a coherent story that had its twists and turns, and confronts issues in life after extinction in ways I never would have imagined. On top of that, a brilliant score meshes all of those environments together and serves as the icing on the cake to the wonderful narrative. The one major gripe I had with the game was the voice overs. The voice actors overall did a great job conveying realistic emotion, but their work is held back by some questionably bad compression. Highs are clipped and ""s""s are sharp and distracting. I don't remember it being so bad when I played on PS4, but I really do hope a patch down the line fixes this. I really do not want to spoil more of the experience as I believe this game is one that everyone should have the chance to experience mostly blind, if their machine can run it. EDIT: I forgot to include that my game had a bug in HDR mode where the Paper White (baseline brightness) slider moved itself to 0 nits, so my screen is completely black and I can't change this value in any .ini files, so I was unfortunately unable to enjoy its HDR presentation.",60.8 hrs on record																					(60.7 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198336656213,1,Assassin’s Creed® Rogue,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"Played using max settings at 4K 60 fps (AMD Ryzen 3800x, RX 6800 XT and 32 GB DDR4 RAM) using a ReShade preset with SMAA. Gameplay: 8/10 - The peak of AC naval combat. Story: 7/10 - Decent story about disenchantment with the brotherhood Graphics: 7/10 - Environments in particular look great. Music and sound design: 6.5/10 - Love the twist on the main theme, not much else was memorable. Lots of low-quality audio in some scenarios, typical of Ubisoft. Replayability: 5/10 - Originally wanted to 100% but got burnt out and settled with 100% synch-ing the story. Assassin's Creed Rogue is an interesting entry in the franchise, being that you play the role of Shay Cormac, an assassin who was done wrongly by the brotherhood, thus making turning to the Templars. The story makes a good justification of why Shay did what he did; however, I cannot feel as though the characters were really forcing that decision onto him for the sake of the story. Sometimes, I felt like the game was just another Assassin's Creed game, but the color palettes were swapped. It was such a turn-off that ""assassin"" grunts in the game were nothing more than regular foot soldiers in military uniforms with tri-corn hats that basically had a label slapped on their back to say ""assassin"". It did not help that the British and French factions in the game had almost the exact same uniforms. They were uninteresting and went against everything the past franchise games had built up about the faction, in my opinion. If more time was spent making the assassins look more like they did in the past, it would have really helped with the immersion. The stalker mechanic was cool but got old quickly for me. Naval combat is at the best it has ever been since its inception in Assassin's Creed 3. It was satisfying, responsive, and immersive, especially with the detailed environments and water. The melee combat was the same as usual, and nothing to cry home about. Overall, I enjoyed playing through this game. I think it was overshadowed by Unity's release for the Xbox One and PS4 consoles. To be honest, with how this game's story ended, it should have released as a standalone game for all consoles to give Unity another year in the oven. Releasing Unity the following year would have left it time to polish and it would transition to Arno Dorian's story nicely. This is a great Assassin's Creed game worth picking up for the low, or with the rest of the franchise if it is on sale.",24.2 hrs on record,N/A
76561198336656213,1,Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"Played using max settings and SMAA at 4K 60 fps (AMD Ryzen 3800x, RX 6800 XT and 32 GB DDR4 RAM) using a ReShade preset. Gameplay: 8/10 - Good old Assassin's Creed 4 style combat. Story: 6.5/10 - Overall enjoyable, but nothing special. Didn't put me to sleep. Graphics: 7/10 - Looks good for 2014. Music and sound design: 6.5/10 - Soundtrack had a recognizable motif, but was not memorable. SFX decent. Replayability: 5/10 - Small map. Nothing left to do once you finish the story and grab the few collectibles. A formulaic, standalone DLC entry for AC4 Black Flag, this third-person action/adventure game follows Adewale, a freed slave that used to ride with Black Flag's protagonist Edward Kenway. Adewale's combat style is distinct from Kenway's and definitely felt good, but it's really just more of the same. The story was an enjoyable experience, especially if you really wanted to know more about him and his convictions following on his appearance in Black Flag; however, it is nothing to cry home about. There is very limited weapon customization, and no appearance customization at all for Adewale. I accidentally stumbled upon the best machete in the game just exploring on my ship following the first memory sequence. The best ranged weapon comes from 100% synch-ing the short main story, which I was able to do in 6 hours along with obtaining all chests and collectibles. Freedom Cry looks and runs great on modern hardware, but is capped at 60 fps with horrible screen tearing even with AMD Freesync Premium if the in-game Vsync is turned off, so I recommend playing with Vsync ON. Overall, if you enjoy the formulaic style of Assassin's Creed games prior to Origins, Freedom Cry is a great short adventure, and worth picking up for cheap.",6.6 hrs on record,N/A

While the physics-based gameplay and VR immersion were certainly present, the overall experience just didn't live up to the expectations set by its predecessor. One of the biggest letdowns was the lack of a cohesive narrative or story to drive the player forward. Boneworks had a compelling storyline that kept me engaged throughout, but Bonelab felt more like a sandbox with no clear objective. While some players may enjoy this more open-ended approach, I found it to be a major step backwards. Another issue I had with Bonelab was the limited amount of content. After completing a few levels, I found myself quickly running out of new challenges to tackle. The game felt like it was over before it really got started, which was a stark contrast to the vast amount of content and replayability found in Boneworks. Overall, while Bonelab certainly has its strengths, it just doesn't hold up to the high standards set by its predecessor. If you're looking for a thrilling VR experience with a compelling story and endless replayability, I'd recommend sticking with Boneworks instead.",15.8 hrs on record																					(12.4 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198731493400,7,LEGO® Indiana Jones™: The Original Adventures,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"Lego Indiana Jones is a classic examples of the LEGO video game franchise, which has become known for its entertaining and accessible gameplay, charming humor, and iconic characters and settings from popular movies and franchises. Both LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures and LEGO Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues have their own unique strengths and weaknesses, making it difficult to determine which game is definitively better. However, based on certain factors such as storyline, gameplay, and replayability, I believe that LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures is the better of the two games. First and foremost, LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures offers a more cohesive and well-structured storyline that stays true to the original Indiana Jones movies. The game features all four of the classic Indiana Jones movies, including Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom, The Last Crusade, and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and players can explore each movie's iconic moments and settings in a fun and whimsical way. The storyline is well-written and easy to follow, making it engaging for both children and adults. Another factor that makes LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures the better game is its more balanced and enjoyable gameplay. The game offers a mix of puzzle-solving, action, and exploration, and the controls are simple and intuitive, making it easy for players of all ages to pick up and play. The levels are well-designed and offer a good challenge, and there is plenty of replayability as players can collect LEGO studs, unlock new characters, and discover hidden secrets. In contrast, LEGO Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues suffers from a more convoluted storyline that often feels disjointed and disorganized. The game tries to combine elements from all four movies into one overarching story, but the result is often confusing and hard to follow. The gameplay is also less balanced, with a greater emphasis on action and combat at the expense of puzzle-solving and exploration. In conclusion, while both LEGO Indiana Jones games are entertaining and enjoyable, I believe that LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures is the better of the two. Its well-written and cohesive storyline, balanced gameplay, and replayability make it a standout entry in the LEGO video game franchise, and a must-play for fans of Indiana Jones and LEGO games. But The Nintendo DS version of LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures has been widely praised by fans and critics alike, and for good reason. It offers a truly exceptional gaming experience that builds upon the already strong foundation of the original game and takes it to new heights. The Nintendo DS version of the game is widely considered to be the best version of LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures and is often held up as one of the best games ever made for the Nintendo DS. One of the key reasons why the Nintendo DS version of LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures is so highly regarded is its improved graphics and presentation. The Nintendo DS is known for its dual screens and touch screen capabilities, and the game makes full use of these features to create a truly immersive gaming experience. The graphics are sharper, the animations are smoother, and the overall presentation is more polished, making it a pleasure to play from start to finish. Another major factor that contributes to the Nintendo DS version's superiority is its improved gameplay. The game's levels have been designed specifically for the Nintendo DS and take advantage of its unique features, such as the touch screen and dual screens. The puzzles are more challenging and engaging, the action sequences are more exciting, and the overall gameplay is more balanced, making it a truly enjoyable experience. The Nintendo DS version of LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures also offers more replayability than the other versions, with a wealth of bonus content and unlockable characters. Players can collect LEGO studs, find hidden secrets, and unlock new characters, providing a great incentive to replay the game multiple times. In conclusion, the Nintendo DS version of LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures is the best version of the game and one of the best games ever made for the Nintendo DS. Its improved graphics, presentation, gameplay, and replayability make it a must-play for fans of LEGO games and Indiana Jones, and a true masterpiece of the Nintendo DS. Whether you are a fan of the franchise or just looking for a fun and entertaining game to play on your Nintendo DS, LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures is a game that should not be missed.",13.6 hrs on record																					(7.1 hrs at review time),N/A

Men på hospitalet fik de en overraskelse, for de opdagede, at uran-258 ikke var farligt for Affe, men faktisk gav ham superkræfter! Affe blev hurtigt en berømt helt, der red på sin toilet og bekæmpede onde kræfter. Men en dag blev Affe udfordret af en skurk ved navn Tørstig Tænk, der havde en plan om at tørsteslå hele verden. Affe mødte Tørstig Tænk i en epic kamp, og selvom Affe havde sin superstyrke, var det en hård kamp. Men til sidst lykkedes det Affe at besejre Tørstig Tænk ved at dræne hans tørst med en kæmpe stråle af askevand. Verden fejrede Affe som en helt, og han fortsatte med at rejse rundt og bekæmpe ondskab, altid på udkig efter sit næste eventyr. Affe blev et symbol på mod og styrke, og hans navn blev brugt som et udtryk for at overvinne selv de største udfordringer. Og sådan levede Affe sit liv, altid klar til at tage på sin næste mission, med sin toilet ved sin side og en stråle af askevand klar til at bekæmpe ondskab. Men Affe havde også en stor svaghed. Han havde en stærk tørst efter mere askevand, og hvis han ikke fik nok, ville hans kræfter svækkes. Derfor besluttede Affe at tage på en rejse for at finde kilden til det ultimative askevand, så han aldrig ville løbe tør igen. På sin rejse mødte Affe mange forhindringer, men han kæmpede videre, altid drevet af sin vilje til at beskytte verden. Endelig nåede han frem til kilden til det ultimative askevand, men han opdagede, at den var beskyttet af en stærk beskytter, der kun ville give adgang til den, der viste den største mod. Affe blev udfordret til en kamp, og selvom han var træt efter sin lange rejse, blev han ikke bange. Han kæmpede med alt, hvad han havde, og til sidst lykkedes det ham at besejre beskytteren og få adgang til kilden til det ultimative askevand. Han drak af kilden, og hans kræfter blev styrket til et niveau, han aldrig havde forestillet sig. Affe vendte tilbage til verden som en endnu stærkere helt, og hans navn blev brugt som et symbol på, at det er muligt at overvinde selv de største udfordringer, hvis man har mod og vilje. Og sådan levede Affe sit liv, altid klar til at tage på sin næste mission, med sin toilet ved sin side og en stråle af det ultimative askevand klar til at bekæmpe ondskab. Men en dag blev Affe udfordret af en ny fjende. Skurken Dr. Håndvask havde opfundet en kraftig maskine, der kunne ødelægge hele verden med et enkelt tryk på en knap. Affe vidste, at han måtte handle hurtigt, hvis han ville redde verden. Han hoppede på sit toilet og fløj til ""Der Affe Togstation"", hvor Dr. Håndvask havde gemt sin ødelæggelsesmaskine. Affe blev mødt af en hær af robotter, men han kæmpede med alt, hvad han havde, og lykkedes med at besejre dem en efter en. Endelig stod Affe ansigt til ansigt med Dr. Håndvask. Skurken prøvede at ødelægge Affe med sin maskine, men Affe viste sin styrke og sin mod, og lykkedes med at ødelægge maskinen, før den kunne gøre nogen skade. Dr. Håndvask flygtede, men Affe vidste, at han ikke ville give op så let. Han satte efter ham, og efter en hæsblæsende jagt fangede han ham og bragte ham til retfærdighed. Verden var sikker igen, og Affe blev hyldet som en helt. Men han vidste, at der altid ville være nye fjender og nye udfordringer, så han holdt øje med horisonten, altid klar til sin næste mission. Efter hans sejr over Dr. Håndvask blev Affe en berømt helt i hele verden, men ingen steder var hans popularitet større end i Danmark. Folk strømmede til gaderne for at fejre ham, og mange roste ham for hans mod og styrke. Pludselig fik Affe en invitation fra den danske kongefamilie. De fortalte ham, at de var dybt imponerede af hans evner og ønskede at tilbyde ham tronen som konge af Danmark. Affe var stærkt overrasket over dette tilbud, men han vidste, at det var en mulighed, han ikke kunne afslå. Han takkede ja, og blev kronet som konge med stor fanfare og glæde. Som konge viste Affe sin visdom og retfærdighed. Han førte Danmark ind i en ny æra af fred og fremgang, og hans regering blev kendt for at være retfærdig og effektiv. Folket elskede ham, og han blev en af Danmarks mest elskede monarker nogensinde. Men selv med al den magt og anerkendelse, aldrig glemte Affe sine rødder og forblev den samme beskedne og modige helt, som han altid havde været. Affe begyndte at lede Danmark med en ny styrke og beslutsomhed. Han implementerede en række nye politikker, der forbedrede landets økonomi og samfund, og hans regering blev hurtigt kendt for sin effektivitet. Men Affe ville ikke nøjes med bare at føre Danmark til succes. Han så muligheden for at gøre landet til en supermagt, og han besluttede sig for at gøre alt for at opnå dette mål. Han begyndte en kampagne for at erobre de omkringliggende lande, og først og fremmest var hans mål Nordsverige og England. Affe førte sine tropper til et serie af overvældende sejre, og snart havde han erobret hele Nordsverige og England. Folket i de erobrede lande beundrede Affes lederskab og hans evne til at føre dem til fremgang og fred. De valgte at tilslutte sig Danmark, og sammen dannede de en ny supermagt, der blev frygtet og respekteret af alle. Affe blev nu en af de mest magtfulde monarker i verden, men han aldrig mistede sit fokus på retfærdighed og barmhjertighed. Han regnerede med en hånd, der var både stærk og blød, og han blev elsket af sit folk til enden af ​​sin dage.",4.0 hrs on record																					(4.0 hrs at review time),N/A
