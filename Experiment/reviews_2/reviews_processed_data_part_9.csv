76561198025583859,1,Against the Storm,"Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"Against the Storm really shows its strength in when you pause the game. In most RTS games, you pause to manage micro. That's absolutely something you can do in Against the Storm, but the micro isn't really very punishing, so you're not going to gain much efficiency doing that versus managing in real time. The challenge in Against the Storm, and why you pause, is choosing which direction you're going to move your economy. The game actually pauses itself when giving certain choices. There are a lot of effects which can modify the game, making certain actions more or less rewarding. Ultimately, your goal is to make a functional system providing for the needs of your town for long enough to move on, which involves balancing exploitation and sustainability, and pushing your economy into a direction where beneficial effects cause it to be far more efficient than a basic one. Like most RTS, Against the Storm is a race against the clock, but what really matters is the making it through the hostile storms which close each year, when a host of negative effects make managing your settlement more difficult, most significantly by causing your townspeople to lose hope. The game is tuned so that providing for your people and making it through these storms become progressively more difficult as your settlement expands and time goes by. People leave when they are fed up, making the town simultaneously easier to provide for while also subtracting from the timer you have before you are hauled back from leadership, presumably to be dressed down by the throne. The metagame around the basic gameplay is also rich, with rewards scaling with difficulty, a prestige system that makes it progressively harder, and a quest to reforge seals which rewards you for finishing settlements in fewer years. All-in-all, I'm very pleased with the game, and have not climbed near the top of it yet despite over a hundred hours and dozens of settlements.",160.2 hrs on record																					(124.2 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198025583859,1,Fashion Police Squad,"Action, Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"What seemed at first to be a pretty uninspired Doom clone with a different skin actually has some pretty decent writing and unique gameplay. The gimmick in Fashion Police Squad is that fashion crimes are all unique and require a specific response. Gameplay-wise, this means that you need to use different weapons on each enemy type. The game keeps this pretty fun, although having to switch weapons all the time can be a bit tiring as well as a challenge.",1.8 hrs on record,N/A

76561198025583859,2,Forgive Me Father,"Action, Indie",Recommended,"The first thing I noticed about Forgive Me Father was the black screen it presented on boot. I searched discussions to find a solution, and did a few things on other monitors while trying to figure out how to resolve the issue. Before I did anything however, after about 10 minutes or so, the game picked itself up and displayed a launch screen. The game itself starts with a lot of story. I expected a comparable amount of story in-game, but the game at its core is a fairly basic 2.5D shooter. The game mechanics were innovative, but playing on default settings, I also noticed some of the worst screen tearing I'd ever seen. There is a VSync option, and turning it on resolved that issue, but that's not something that everyone is going to know how to do. If your game suffers from such poor screen synchronization, then you should have VSync on by default. All in all, I might come back to this game or give it a positive review if the system was more stable. After booting it up for the second time and being confronted by a second black screen, I decided that the game wasn't novel enough for me to keep dealing with these tech issues. A 2.5D shooter similar to old DOOM is very much a solved problem and I expect any game implementing one to be a far smoother and glitch-free experience than this one is.",0.7 hrs on record,N/A

76561198025583859,3,The Signifier Director's Cut,"Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"The Signifier suffers from the negative impact of a fairly common trend in videogame: simplification of interface. Much of the game takes place in a reconstructed mindscape, with odd distortions and glitched voxel blitting. It's an environment where figuring out how to interact is not always straightforward, a problem the devs attempt to resolve in two ways, making a system of in-game rules for interactions, and restricting the level of interaction allowed. The rules system works, more or less, but the restriction on interactions is not uniform enough. When you're not allowed to pick the average object up, or move in certain ways that are only slightly visually counterindicated, it's not always clear what you are allowed to do. Sometimes merely looking at something is enough to trigger the quicktime event advancing the plot, sometimes you have to click an eye or hand icon, which isn't always immediately visible. There's a reason that the VR version is so hotly anticipated, as it would potentially fix much of this interaction problem, but, also, probably a reason why it's not forthcoming, as making it would likely require nontrivial interaction fixes.",5.1 hrs on record,N/A
76561198025583859,3,Mars Horizon,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"Space exploration is made possible through the tireless efforts of scientists. It's about getting to mind-boggling velocities and designing systems that function in vacuum. It's not, generally, all that predictable or easy to understand. Mars Horizon puts you at the head of a space agency, and sweeps all the technical detail under the rug. Progress in Mars Horizon is made through missions, where you launch a module into space and have it perform certain actions. The minigame here has potential, but is hampered by the fact that the actions and effects are almost completely decoupled from the real thing. You're managing several different bins of resources; starting with 'energy', you need to create 'communications', 'data', 'navigation', etc. This in itself is fine, but the actions you're using to manipulate them and the motivations for their critical success and failure are all technobabble. Some of the special resources, like 'alignment', 'heat'. and 'thrust', do a better job of tying into the actual reality of the missions, but that's the exception and not the rule. Most egregious, in my opinion, was the energy mechanism where, if you didn't like the result of an action, you could ""force"" it for 1 energy. This felt very cheap, as when something actually goes wrong on a mission like that, throwing energy at it won't help. As a result, I found that I wasn't able to be as immersed in the missions as I wanted. Most of the rest of the game is a turn-based management sim, competing with your rival space agencies to be the first to various preset mission objectives. There's also a diplomacy system, but interactions with other agencies feel distant and limited. Mostly, you're trying to make sure you spend your money wisely enough that you can keep your space program running. A large part of your early game is worrying about finding room for all the buildings your space agency wants at your 'base', which, for some reason, you decided to build in a hilly and heavily wooded area. Chopping down those trees and leveling that land will cost money! And don't forget the adjacency bonuses for placing different building types next to each other, something which I couldn't find any explanation of beyond the red and green lines that appear when you go to attempt to place the buildings next to each other! All in all, I quit sometime around the manned mission to the moon, because I felt more like a rocket parts and facilities accountant than a space explorer. It's too bad, because I really wanted to like this game. It has decently modeled renditions of actual historical rocket stages, and interesting blurbs which pop up when you complete missions and research (cynically, probably only as a condition of the support of the ESA). Something which could have been an interesting educational experience by more closely integrating actual history, a more engaging experience by sticking closer to the actual mechanics of spaceflight, or a funner experience by increasing the potential for interaction between agencies and making the game multiplayer, instead turns into a single-player slog.",10.4 hrs on record,N/A

76561198025583859,3,Beyond: Two Souls,"Action, Adventure",Recommended,"Beyond: Two Souls is an interesting concept that ends up being underwhelming in execution. The first thing you might notice starting the game is the quality of the face models, which is very high. Unfortunately, the rest of the game doesn't continue to deliver on that quality. On the same topic, the face rigging is not quite good enough, so many expressions end up looking a bit wooden, but there are also large shortfalls in writing and gameplay. Gameplay Gameplay in Two Souls is often as interesting and engaging as using a remote to change the television channel, if you weren't quite sure which button you needed to press to change it. The core gameplay centers around walking, basic object interaction, and quicktime events, with occasional dialogue choices. The walking and interaction portion is fairly restrictive, with obtrusive methods to keep players on the rails, while also sometimes failing to indicate how to progress. Because certain actions, like walking out of a given area, or interacting with plot irrelevant objects, end up being categorically disallowed, it's easy to assume that certain choices and actions will be disallowed if they aren't obviously presented. Additionally, it's far too easy to end up stuck on objects, and the walking pace rarely varies, even when a run would be more narratively appropriate. At one of the few points you do run, it immediately bugged and got the character caught in a wall. Seeing your character doing a walk cycle stuck to the corner of a table is funny, but breaks immersion as much as the game's guardrails. Quicktime events I recognize as a neccessary evil to provide people who aren't very good at gaming a way to feel immersed and triumphant in gameplay. However, those in Beyond: Two Souls, suffer from often having the cues for directional reactions be unclear. Writing The writing ended up failing for me on two levels. While the overall storyline was OK, the writing was constantly melodramatic, making many narrative decisions to maximize drama instead of provide explanation or background. The path through the work was very linear, and I even got dialogue that blatantly contradicted choices I'd made earlier. At a very basic level, a canon and continuity for the story was lacking. The power and ability of the spirit you control seems driven purely by narrative convenience, as do many of the details of the game world. In the end, it gives the game the same level of narrative quality as a bad movie; entertaining in the moment but cheesy and easily forgettable. P.S. Where it went wrong Beyond: Two Souls does include some information about development, unlocked by collecting certain 'Bonuses' as Aiden. I didn't unlock all of them, but here's what I noticed from those I did unlock: - Quantic Dream had good concepts. I unlocked two trailers for games 'not currently under production', and found them at least as interesting as Two Souls itself. - I was surprised to learn that the game was done almost entirely using motion capture. The rigidness of the facial models at points and the derpy walk cycles indicate that Quantic Dream didn't adequately invest in the algorithms or QA necessary for translating their capture into the game world, despite enormous investment in the capture itself. - The creative team was run as a dictatorship with a scriptwriter on the top, and knowing this makes it unsurprising that the writing is often anemic and many player decisions are on rails. In the interview about gameplay David Cage states that he has ""an idea of how [he] wants the story to be played"". That's followed by a quote by Associate Lead Gamplay developer Simon Wasselin, who states that they developed the game constantly checking ""to see if it matches what he had in mind. In case it doesn't we go back to the writing stage and keep working until it perfectly matches David's vision."" This is an unhealthy way to run a creative team. A competent creator knows how to take criticism, collaborate, and adapt to the medium, skills that would be difficult to hone or display in such an environment.",31.9 hrs on record,N/A

There are secret passages and events liberally scattered throughout the  game, some of which are necessary for progression. The game demonstrates how more isn't always better; the additional content and level gimmicks serve to distract rather than enhance the game. I stuck with the game until a level that was completely peaceful, serving as an interlude in the story. Unfortunately, I found the story as imperfectly polished as the gameplay.

This is no longer true, and the game can now best be described as hostile towards casual play. When KARDS came out, it was a game about deploying and moving your units to attack your opponents base. Yes, there were a few gotchas, but in general the gameplay was straightforward. Now, without an encyclopedic knowledge of the cards, you're simply not getting anywhere. UPDATE: Yes, the devs have come out with a new progression system. There do not seem to be any rewards in the new system. For comparison, in the previous system earning the field marshal rank in each nation would net you eight packs and an elite card. This exacerbates the basic gameplay issue, and moves KARDS far closer to a pay-to-win model. UPDATE 2: I've played again as mobile version is out. Balance seems to be more stable, but not what it used to be, your deck will need to have a strong construction to even begin to play.

76561198025583859,6,5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel,Indie,Recommended,"Let's be clear: ""5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel"" is a really good idea. I recommend it wholeheartedly with the following provisos. 1. It's not really 5D Chess. There are at most 4 dimensions in evidence: The 2D chess board repeated in time and multiverse dimensions. With the title, I expected that time travel would be in addition to 5 full dimensions. 2. The rules around time+multiverse travel are a bit dicey. Whether you like it or not, chess itself is a very polished game. It's well balanced and still, allowing for a few special cases, very easy to grasp. In contrast, the multiverse portion of the game feels very much like the first version that ended up even remotely balanced. Things like the somewhat arbitrary restriction on number of active boards or the importance of multiverse ordering add obscurity to the game, while the somewhat flat extension of piece moves into the additional dimensions mean that the pieces' abilities in these dimensions don't end up very balanced. Pawns are near worthless, while knights, due to their unique ability to move freely through the multiverse, far more powerful. The developer attempted to address these shortcomings by introducing two new pieces to the game; the dragon and the unicorn, which essentially act like multiverse-native variations on bishops, but this barely scratches the surface of what should be possible in more dimensions. 3. The playerbase is small. Frankly, the above problems are forgivable because there is an active playerbase good at the game. It is still quite small, and, as far as I know, localized to the game's Discord server. All in all, good for a meme, and will get you thinking about multidimensional possibilities. EDIT: Played a bit more, had a decent public match even. Balance issues persist and one of the setups 'Misc - Very Small' is Mate-in-1. Better than chess, but not by too much. Again, negative review very much a reflection of the anemic playerbase. EDIT: Joining the Discord server has solved my main gripe with this game.

The combat system is innovative, but not polished or challenging at all. The animation style helps characterize the sprites, but looks a bit cheesy against a static background and has resolution issues. The story was intriguing, but never particularly interesting. All in all, the excessively stilted game design around combat is a huge part of why I can't recommend this game. Most of the important story and battle beats happen in cutscenes with no player input, and the combat itself feels grindy and samey. The resolution screen at the end of each battle distracts from the game and breaks immersion. It says something that the most fun I had with this game was watching the character sprites do battle in cutscenes and wishing that actual combat was anything similar.",6.0 hrs on record,N/A

Overall, however, it's a success in bringing the MSPaint style to life. The main problem that jumps out at me is about this game has little to do with the game itself; it's that the insane production value showcased here may be economically infeasible to maintain for something that's now more than a passion project. This installment took 5 years to develop, and the promised sequel has still not materialized.

76561198025583859,10,Darkest Dungeon®,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"Not worth the hype. :/ As someone who's played and enjoyed many other games in similar genres, I was excited to play Darkest Dungeon, but found that it didn't hold up in comparison to the others I'd played. The most obvious game to compare this to is Monster's Den: Book of Dread. Monster's Den is a free turn based game from 2008 where you explore a dungeon and fight enemies for rewards. There's no town, but the combat is incredibly nuanced and rewarding. Compared to this, Darkest Dungeon combat felt repetitive and clunky. The equip system was also not nearly as harrowing. There's generally only one or two characters where their equips will even *work*, so you don't need to worry about who gets the rare shoes and who gets cloth stockings. Still, there's something to be said for simplicity. The modern XCOM games abstract a lot of your choices, leaving you with a 2D movement system and a few variations on 'fire', and are still formidable chance-based strategy. Darkest Dungeons is essentially the same thing, only with 1D movement. The problem is that 1D movement is a lot more constrained than 2D. There are only 4 positions in every battle, and players mostly stand in the same place to keep their attacks effective. This leaves just management (torches, looting, town) and attacks as the deep mechanics. One of the most powerful draws of Darkest Dungeon is the 'roguelike progress', which invites you to feel like you're moving forward, even as heroes crumple at your feet. Adding story-style progress to a roguelike is a difficult yet emotionally powerful mechanic that's difficult to do right. Darkest Dungeon uses a RPG-style checklist as well as town management mechanics to motivate this. It's effective, but not an elegant solution, and you're prone to feeling sometimes that you're just slogging through dark halls, as opposed to participating in a story. Another draw is the art style. Even if the mechanics of a game aren't as well oiled as they could be, that can all be made up for by a slick visual style. I have to admit that I don't know anything quite as striking as the stress and victory halos the heroes get as they fail and succeed. Still, it's not as if this game is unique in that right either. As a top-down shooter, Our Darker Purpose is a bit different gameplaywise, but it still does far better at motivating 'roguelike progress', and equally good at putting out a visual style to make you question the dark nature of humanity. In conclusion, if you look at Darkest Dungeon and say ""a Cthulian-style roguelike management game? That's just what I've *needed*"", purchase it, you won't be disappointed. If you're like me and say ""Darkest Dungeon? I've heard good things about it, so it must be really great"", then I'd recommend you think twice.

76561198025583859,10,MASSIVE CHALICE,"Indie, Strategy",Recommended,"As I made my way through the 300 years it takes to charge the chalice, I was originally planning to write a cautious positive review. This game deserves some praise for the solid mechanics it demonstrates. They make the game fun, even through plodding self-insert writing, repetitive gameplay, and general lack of refinement in several aspects of the game. I'd planned to say that the game was good, and would have been great, if only polished more. Unfortunately, after finishing, I find myself unable to give this recommendation. For context, everything in the game builds towards the charging of the chalice. You send crack teams of five controllable heros out to occasional battles, and decide the research, intercourse and economy of an upper class of those 'attuned to the chalice' in a nation beset by a sinister enemy, the Cadence. The rest of the time, you 'sleep'. The game builds the chalice as a mystical power, with dialogue-based time shenanigans and curative powers that spice up the 300 year wait. These 3 choice dialogues were actually a very necessary respite for the tedium of waiting 300 years, going through battles that because of the mildly varied but still quite limited classes and locations soon became a bit repetitive. So naturally, I expected something special for the final battle. Perhaps being able to use all of my heros in an epic final stand, or, going off the time shenanigans earlier, being able to choose my heros from all of those who'd passed away as well as those alive. So, I was somewhat disappointed that the selection was made normally. It turned out that there actually was something different about the final battle, the enemy attempted to attack the 500HP chalice instead of your heros, something that actually made it easier. Oh well, I'd been playing on normal, so perhaps it would have been more epic on greater difficulty. Dispatch the last of the enemies and... done! Only, the ending was a disappointment. A flop on the visual, emotional, and writing level. Not much worse than the starting cutscene, but after 300 years... you expect something a bit more. Drama, a last look at your kingdom, something. There *was* a grand reveal, but so hamhanded that it had very little impact, and didn't make the half-day that playing the game through takes worthwhile. So I retried the game on brutal hardcore difficulty, though it's worth noting that I never restored from save on my first game. Long story short, my heart was no longer in it. The whole game builds toward the end, and since I now knew that was no great shakes, it was just a slog. I made it maybe 50 years before my alchemists blew up, and even though I very well might persist, I no longer felt it.

76561198025583859,11,The Fall,"Action, Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"It's an awesome story. Pros: -Excellent Story showcasing escape from 3 law robotics -Excellently realized alien creatures -Quality, heartfelt writing Unfortunately, I can't really recommend this as a game. Just based on the story this game would be boss, if it was reasonably playable without a walkthrough. It's not. Cons: -Terrible UI -Puzzles often don't give hints, and actions equivalent from human perpective are not game equivalent -Overdependence on quicktime events ruins sandbox feel. You play as A.R.I.D., a military suit A.I. concerned with the health of her occupant. A.R.I.D. is of near-human intelligence, perhaps on the upper bound of it. You interact with the environment via a series of magnifying glass indicators illuminated by flashlight which allow you to see a short description, and interact directly, through network interface, or via items you've picked up (or are nearby). This actually makes a fairly good concept. Illuminating the items adds atmosphere and helps make you feel as though it's you interacting with the objects, even though the relevant animations are automated. Unfortunately, as soon as you have a working sidearm, you toggle between flashlight and laser sight, and laser sight doesn't allow you to interact at all, something I found to be a bit silly, since it still provided a fair amount of illumination. Additionally the 'interact with objects nearby' function isn't well explained, and is only used twice, so it seems grafted on. Another thing that's only used a couple times is the networking function, a top level option on your interact menu. I feel it would make the game richer if the devs had taken the time to add some bits of useless information which you could also grab with your networking capabilities. More detrimental to the gameplay is the 'one path' approach to puzzles. A lot of things seem human equivalent, and should be clear to A.R.I.D. too, given her intelligence. I shouldn't have to distinguish between the source of the fluid and fall of the fluid when collecting it; when I need stuff from something on the ground I can't pick up, what I do need in order to extract it should be made obvious. Given the size of the puzzles, too, there should be a bit more guidance around answers that are almost, but not quite correct. I can hardly count the number of times I saw 'I can't do that.' when I was this close to a solution. The most irritating thing, from a narritive perspective, was the game's assumption that certain events happened in some sort of sequence. A lot of the text I read referred to objects as 'more' or 'another' when I had never even seen one, and the way I traversed the levels triggered the storyline events erratically, one too early, another too late, making the story itself less satisfying. Also, I glitched into a wall during the boss fight. All in all, I find that it's better if I think of this as a sedately paced interactive story with some action than as a game. I actually feel it would be better to remove some of the gameplay than to allow the loose ends and unpredictibiliy such elements leave to interfere with the story. Better still would be to manage such unpredictibility, but the designers don't seem to have done that very well.",5.8 hrs on record,N/A

Something to boot with a couple of friends and spend 15 minutes yelling at each other because one of you tripped the alarm, the other keeps dying, and the third has taken the loot to the polar opposite of the dropoff zone, where they're being overwhelmed by heavy police presence. Overkill may have gone, well, overkill with some of the DLC, but they were adding new content to the game, even if it tended to bit a bit pricey. Then, October 16th, 2015, there was a new addition to the game. Or... calling it an addition is far too generous. There was, all of a sudden, a new crate drop system. Now, before I continue, let me say that I am not actually opposed to the idea of such a system, putting aside the fact that Overkill had, up until this point, all but explicitly promised not to make any microtransaction system part of the game. TF2 has a crate drop system that I must have spent ~$100 on, at this point. That's fine. You can get everything you need to play the game from free weapon drops, and the crate system serves solely to make available more cosmetic functions, and support a free game. Coincidentally, ~$100 is also the amount spent so far for my PAYDAY game and DLC acquisition. In the Payday 2 the crates (safes) carry skins. Skins... that's not much content-wise, that should be entirely ancillary to the gameplay! Or so I hear the logical, rational portion of my brain shout. You really shouldn't criticize Overkill for adding something new to the game, or well, for trying to. Even if they did manage to break all of the game's mods, up to and including HoxHud. It's the thought that counts. Or perhaps it's your wallet. Because if you look closer, take a key (drill) to your crate (safe), you will find that each skin corresponds with a stat boost. If you try to play the game, you will find that the safe-dropping update coincides with a nerf to nearly every reasonably playable gun. That nerf makes them all but unplayable without... a stat boost. All of a sudden things look a lot less funny. In order to play the same game you may have spent in the ballpark of $100 on, you now need to: -Unlock a safe with a drill (and be out the money or time it took to do so) -Hope to get a skin for a weapon you own -Hope the skin has good stats that bring the weapon on par with where it was before the update -Hope the skin doesn't look ugly as hell That's a lot of hoping/money/playtime/etc. The take-home: dropping safes on people is a classic gag, but it's not so funny when it happens to you. Kind of strikes you as... Overkill, really.",61.7 hrs on record																					(61.0 hrs at review time),N/A

You don't really start out with a squad that makes the campaign winnable. I would actually recommend it for anyone with scads of free time... were it not for the price.

76561198025583859,11,Zeno Clash 2,"Action, Indie",Recommended,":( First, let me preface this review by saying that Zeno Clash is just about the best thing ever. I was going to write a rave review about it, but I foolishly decided to play Zeno Clash 2 first. The problems start with the tutorial/prelude. I might not have played the tutorial if it hadn't also been labelled prelude. As it was, punching Metamoq in the face with some voiceover recap of the plot of the previous Zeno Clash in the background sounded like just the thing, which should indicate how good the first Zeno Clash was. The first thing I noticed was the lack of filters. The first Zeno Clash had a hazy effect, which made distant objects blur and added to the atmosphere, and which I assumed was an attribute of Zenozoik. Not so, apparently, since that effect is gone in this game. Instead there is music added to the voiceover. Music was used sparingly in the first Zeno Clash, so the overall effect was that of excessive melodrama. Oh well, if a bit overdone, the plot is still awesome, and punching Metamoq in the face till it's over should be simple, right? After all, I defeated the last game, and know how this goes. ... Not so much. It turns out that there's combos and stuff now. The 'lock on' key has been switched, which is a minor annoyance, but more annoying is that it's a bit difficult to connect with some of the attacks. I find out that the tutorial is glitched when I manage to check a box without fulfilling the requirements, and just stand there for a while, since the game won't move forward until I satisfy the /actual/ requirements. It's here that I start to worry that the game might be overcome by feature creep. A worry which is not abated when I find that, despite beating the previous game, I am unable to do the '5-part launch combo' required in the tutorial, even more ironic since it comes after Metamoq's quote: ""If you are satisfied and do what you feel you must do, no matter what that is, then you have reached perfection."" Apprehensive, I finally quit from the endless nightmare of facing a downcast Metamoq and start the real game, hopeful that the tutorial was an ill-conceived quick add-on. But of course, the problems continue into the real game. The combat system is now so complex that I have no idea what I'm doing in the first fight, and the AI manages to trip over itself without any clever guidance from me. In the first game, if you plan it right, you can have heavy enemies smash through lighter ones to get to you, or have lighter ones glare at you, unable to attack through the enemy interposed between you. You can even attack enemies from behind if they're distracted by picking up weapons, something which I had to exploit to defeat one scene. But the AI in the first game is actually pretty good. It hides from your shooting range when it thinks it can, and does stuff like sneak up behind you. I didn't see any of that here. What I did see wasn't much better. Somehow, combat looks jittery, and the lighting isn't the same. I saw a new creature design, with even more nudity, and knocked it out before stumbling across a most egregious example of feature creep. Remember how the 'lock on' key was remapped? It's now the key for 'exit area'. To understand how terrible this is, you have to understand how the first Zeno Clash worked. You would sometimes walk places without fighting, and sometimes you would fight. Another example of Metamoq's wisdom. Oh well, I exit, and the story goes on... and on. One of the great strengths of the first Zeno Clash was how much it did with very little dialogue. This is not the case here, where it takes three sentences for your sister to tell you that you're helping her break Father-Mother out of jail. And then... nothing. Oh wait, a tower that says 'Level Up!'. Feature creep indeed! Let's go there, then get stuck before realizing that we have no skill points yet, pull out a map, which utterly butchers the charming minimalism of the one in the first Zeno Clash, then forget how to put it away, leaving us stuck, until we remember it was 'M', and run around aimlessly, and... we can talk to a person? Wait a sec, did we just get a quest? When did this become an RPG, anyway? Not the first Zeno Clash, not a good RPG. (-10)/10",1.8 hrs on record,N/A
76561198025583859,11,Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller,"Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"It's really unfortunate that I can't give this game a good review... it's got some very nice attention to detail at some points, such as when you try to boost Erica, the protagonist, into her cognition mode when she's already there. You get an artfully done flash of red, indicating a rush of blood at the fruitless attempt to boost her preternatural ability. Or take Erica's mobile phone, where you can do anything from choose tags for web searches for entertainment, to have Erica tell you that she doesn't happen to feel like listening to music at the moment , as her brother is currently being tortured. When you break the hand off a statue, in an act of possibly regrettable vandalism, the hand stays behind, instead of disappearing into hammerspace . Details like these can really make a game experience, providing immersion for some truly diverting story or gameplay. And this is where the game fails. The gameplay is fairly standard for a point-and-click, with a nice flourish from the cognition ability and the very streamlined interaction system, so that's not the problem... No, the game fails on story. The first puzzle turns out to be very simple, something easy to solve while you're still leaning the interface. The madman who has taken Erica's brother has used a makeshift lock to hide in a masoleum, then buried the key out back. Without waiting for backup, Erica and her partner bust into the graveyard , where the only shovel has been cemented into the hand of the 'weeping angel'-style statue . It's a point-and-click, so instead of being able to dig in the loose dirt with her hands, Erica needs to use the hammer from the toolbox to whack off the statue's hand, in order to obtain the shovel to dig. Fine. Except Erica can't dig. The shovel is tainted with the psychic unpleasantness of having whacked her brother in the back of the head . She tries, then tearfully informs the player that she can't use the shovel. An entirely psychic weakness from a psychic isn't very reassuring, and it's conveyed to be on about the same level as a fear of spiders, which is puzzling. It's one of my pet peeves in these sorts of games when the character refuses to do something; not because they couldn't, or it isn't really feasible, but just because they don't want to get their hands dirty. It's a tendency which disproportionately affects female characters. Okay, fine. Maybe I'm being unfair. After all, it's not like psychic abilities don't have downsides too. A blessing and a curse. In any case, Erica goes back to get her male partner and tells him to dig, which he ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ about, but he probably doesn't know about her ability. A secret, double-edged ability, wielded gingerly by a ginger heroine. At this point, I feel like I may have been a bit unfair to label the exchange unreasonably sexist. Erica claims the key from the ground and heads to the front of the masoleum. Then things get really bad. First of all, in the upcoming exchange, her partner reveals that he knows about Erica's ability, which ruins my headcanon of Erica's careful management of her secret capability. Then again, the entire scene ruins Erica's credibility, and calls into question her ability to reasonably manage anything. Erica trys the arcane stone wheel key on the makeshift lock, and tries to turn it. It won't turn, not unless someone is standing on the pressure plate. 'It's a trap!' says her partner, fat white male police guy, 'wait for backup!'. 'No!' snarls Erica, 'I'm doing this'. She turns the wheel... and spikes pop out near her legs. 'Stop!' says fat white police guy 'You see, I was right!' (Actually, I think I jumped the gun on his previous line of dialogue, so he doesn't actually say this, he says that instead, but w/e). And then Erica pulls her gun and points it at her partner's head. Erica has an FBI badge in her inventory, and my guess is that it isn't forged. Given that, her pulling of a gun loses all its melodramatic teenager-style charm. Erica should know how to use a gun , and would only pull it in two cases, to incapacitate, aiming at limbs to slow a dangerous target, or to kill, as a last resort. Given how her gun is directed, she's offering to kill her partner for worrying about her safety. Just wait, it gets worse. Turns out the cryptic message scrawled on the door indicates that the murderer who has her brother wants her to drive the spikes into her shins by continuing to turn the wheel. He's watching them through the camera he installed, so he could probably open the door at any time. Erica's plan is... to do it. Her resolution here is utterly baffling after her refusal to lift a shovel . She turns the wheel to do so, and gives a shriek indicating low pain-tolerance, even after being totally prepared (if I was being sexist, I would say the shriek was 'manly', due to some studies which indicate that men have, on average, lower pain tolerances. Not everyone bases their sexism on statistically derived fact, however, so I feel that the majority of people would come to the opposite determination, were they being sexist). The door opens, and... the trap springs! Catching her partner in the chest, which Erica seems not too unhappy about. She slumps down the stairs, having difficulty walking on her wounded yet not overly bloody legs, making attractive poses against the walls of the spiral staircase. At this point, I could only come to the determination that the developers were of a sadomasochistic bent, who apart from that (in and of itself, not so shameful) likely enjoyed writing a female character due to all the irrational decisions they could justify with one (which is definately a shame). Erica is supposed to be an FBI agent, something which takes no small amount of work and competance. Instead, she's written like a troubled teenager, which utterly kills the story.",2.1 hrs on record,N/A

76561198025583859,12,BIT.TRIP Presents... Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien,"Action, Casual, Indie",Recommended,"I'm not quite sure what I expected before I played Runner2, probably another obstacle course with the same clear-cut pixel graphics and simple charm of the prequel Runner, perhaps with a bit more underlying menace or excitement pursuant to a Rhythm Alien which apparently featured in it. What I got was something with the same basic gameplay, but with a lot of extras. Extras? Extras are good, right? If you played the first Runner, there was almost nothing more satifying than getting an extra, then speeding along with the music at full audibility, collecting gold with a rainbow contrail stretching to infinity. Sadly though, in this version, extras result in a watery rainbow which trails sadly in your wake, and the music doesn't really noticably change throughout the course of a level. I suppose that anything less wouldn't fit the new 'style' of the game. No, these extras are the normal sort of game extras, extra characters and collectable outfits and a 'reward' system. Collectible outfits? If you're still thinking of the first BIT.TRIP Runner, you may be wondering how that works. I could tell you the first outfit was a pair of earbuds, and you might wonder if that meant whitining a couple pixels on the Runner's ears. Not to fear though, it's all part of the new 'style'. At the beginning of the game, a smarmy narrator informs you that CommanderVideo has been sucked into an alternate dimension, while fighting in some manner of justice league. A new world awaits, with a lot more living things, and more importantly, real 3D graphics. I don't feel that 3D graphics really do much for the game. I felt that my runner was not a s responsive due to the slower nature of the jump animation. In fact, starting out, the overhangs on staircases would always make me trip, as I was used to a more 2D perspective from playing the first runner. Moreover, when I tripped, the runner would swim backwards like an octopus, at a constant rate no matter where I was in the level, which was really irratating if I tripped towards the end (compare Runner, where returning to the start took a fixed amount of time, no matter what). The presence of a lot more living things is worse for the feel of the game, though. In the first runner, the living things include huge tunneling worms, fish, clouds with mustaches, and trampolines with eyes. What all of these have in common though is that they are separated from your gameplay. None of them are beneficiaries or detractors to your Herculean run. Your enemies, such as they are, are robots. In Runner2, the first thing you see is a spike-thing sitting in the road. Then, as you go further on, a drunken pickle registers you at a checkpoint. This makes the aesthetic lonliness which the first game had impossible to acheive. End the level, and a sign flips to tell you it's an ""Amazing Acheivement!"". If you've collected all the gold, you no longer get to go to a fiendishly difficult bonus level, but instead get fired out of a cannon. As the game mechanics were introduced I noticed another thing I didn't like about this sequel, namely, the trigger keys no longer did what they used to. I really enjoyed using A+RTrigger to Jump-kick in the first Runner, but in the second it was not to be. All in all the game comes off as extremely patronizing, with it's hollow achievement system (called 'rewards' for some reason) and its collect all the costumes mentality, which bothers me much more in the face of the sink or swim of the first Runner. It has some promising new mechanics that the first one did not, but they don't necessarily play out. An example is tracing a circle with your right stick, an idea I thought was pretty novel until I realized it had absolutely no impact on the game besides earning extra points. In an effort to enjoy the game more, I switched to the drunken pickle as soon as I possibly could, so that I might be able to enjoy the game for what it was, instead of comparing it to the first runner. A fine idea, though at the character change screen I was briefly greeted by the monstrousity that is CommandgirlVideo. For heavens sake, I believe that collection of black pixel which comprised the protagonist of the first Runner was gender neutral, for that matter, so is the word 'Commander'. Is there any purpose for a second amalgamation of pixels with secondary sexual characteristics other than to alienate half the population from the main protagonist? Do the words 'separate but equal' ring any bells? In any case, I continued playing the game, pretending now that it was the adventures of drunken pickle. I was plesantly releived that noone seemed present at any of the checkpoints, but drunken pickle's extra mode was an all-green rainbow, which should, in any reasonable game, be an oxymoron. I finished off the level, and defeated the boss. But then came a cut scene, featuring CommanderVideo going pointlessly into a whale, even though I'd been playing with drunken pickle the whole time. And then the checkpoints were populated again, by a crab man in a hut. And then I lost interest, and let the game run on to give me Steam Card drops while I wrote this review. So, in conclusion, Runner is better. If you were thinking about playing this game, play Runner. If you've already beaten Runner, go back and do all the challenges, or do it on Perfect mode. If you've already beaten it on perfect mode, then grab your square frames, put them on, and meet me in the cafe down the street, which serves 100% economically sourced coffee-flavored foam, and we can chat about how the first Runner was so much better, before BIT.TRIP went mainstream. Bottom line: Though Runner2 may be better played with a controller, it's better to play the original Runner with that contoller.",1.9 hrs on record,N/A

If you just want something to wank to, great, if you want an actually fun game, this is probably a hard pass. More in depth: the gameplay is pretty basic. There is little to no depth to it. The controls are also a bit rough when it comes to certain attacks. It could use some polish. The movement and jumping on the other hand are fine. Also, there's only 3 short levels. You can probably beat it in like 10-20m. It's pretty obvious the entire budget went into the prons and not the gameplay part.",3.8 hrs on record																					(1.7 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197998141809,4,Prodeus,"Action, Adventure, Casual, Indie",Recommended,"Doom 2016 the demake. If you want a proper review watch Civvie or Yahtzee's videos on it. That being said, I will say that the level design is f*cking phenomenal. It has an extremely good 3d automap which you will never use because getting lost in this game is basically impossible. Which is especially impressive cause the levels are for the most part not especially colorful, so they mostly achieve this by making the various rooms look very distinctive and stand out from each other. Seriously, if you want an example of level design done right, this is a prime example. Another thing I want to say is that the feel of the weapons and especially the sound design for them is great. This game probably has the most satisfying sounding basic pistol of any fps I've ever played. So good. And it never becomes completely useless even when you get better weapons. It's fast, it's accurate, and it packs a punch. And the sound on that gatling gun? Mm mm. Nice. It's a real meat grinder of a weapon and it looks, sounds and feels the part. Well done devs. Oh and the homing minimissiles? Pure joy. I will say though, the railgun could do with a damage boost. Not being able to consistently one shot the not cacodemons is pretty sh*tty. Not being able to one shot the gatling gunners either also sucks. But yeah, all in all, I really like this game. It's been a blast to play, and it has a lot less of that f*cking obnoxious secret finding that plagued Doom 2016 so much. I don't want to explore levels, I just want to f*cking shoot things until they die. I feel like this game gets that. I will say that this game is pretty easy, so if you want an actual challenge then play on something higher than medium.",137.2 hrs on record																					(15.0 hrs at review time),N/A

This got picked up for a fan translation at a time when fan translations were basically not a thing at all because it has an extremely well written and compelling story. Also do yourself a favor and don't visit the steam forums. It's full of idiot coomers who refuse to buy the game simply because there's no titties in it anymore, but make up pretentious bs about ""HURR DURR CENSORSHIP BAD I HAVE PRINCIPLES"" so they don't sound like a child, except it has the opposite effect cause it's so godd*mn obvious. And then on the other side you have equally ret*rded sjw pc woke types who support ACTUAL censorship of dialogue in the game that undermines key themes and messages because they can't seem to understand that in order to prove a point about WHY something is bad, you have to SHOW why it's bad. F*cking idiots, all of them. I wouldn't go so far as to call this a kamige, but it's definitely one of the better VN's I've read in my entire life, and I've been into these things for literally 25 years. If you're like me and you only bought this for the enhanced gameplay, I just want to let you know that yes, you can actually grind for both items and xp in this remake. So now you don't have to worry about xp stealing by characters you're never going to use outside of the one or two mandatory battles they show up in and can just make anyone viable as you please. Also no, I don't know if that one character who dies midway through the game is still usable in combat after they kick the bucket, I haven't played it enough to know that yet.

It also has plenty of goofy dumb humor, which re5 definitely does not have. My only complaint is that they didn't improve the aiming like they did for re5, or the wii port. Even if you use a mouse, it still aims like you're using a controller. If I wanted to do that I'd just replay my ps2 version of this game. Normally I wouldn't complain about that but this game came out after re5, which has proper mouse aiming on pc, and as I already mentioned, the wii version has more or less the same kind of aiming, so there's really no reason for it to still control like this. They shoulda just ported the wii version and replaced the wiimote with the mouse. Overall it's just as good as the console versions, with the exception of that one tiny annoyance.

You can have up to 6 slots of units, including your hero, and certain large units take up 2. These units gain xp and level up and become stronger over time. Your hero can even learn new skills.

I'll write a proper review someday when I can be arsed to but right now I'll just say that this is one of my favorite vn's ever, and the one with easily the best writing I've ever read, but to be fair my list isn't really all that big. Sometimes life kinda gets in the way of doing the things you wanna do. One big pro to this, other than the stellar writing, is full voice acting. Also, the free upgrade patch for those who own an old physical copy of this from way back when removes those obnoxious watermarks that for some dumb reason they left in the steam uncut version. F*cking WHY >:/ But yeah, an easy way to fix that is just copypaste that folder ontop of the steam folder. Voila! No watermarks on your uncensored r*pe scenes.

So if you've ever watched Madoka, you should have a vague idea of what to expect in this. Just uh, like 100x more f*cked up, lol. As good as Madoka was, I personally think this is his magnum opus. I've been thinking about this vn ever since I first played it uh, how many years ago? Probably over 5 years ago. Had a lot of interesting thoughts about it. Like for one, it reads like a biography of Jeffrey Dahmer's personal life. I've read that maybe it's supposed to be an analogy of the hikki-neet lifestyle, and while I don't know if that was the intention, I can definitely see that. Honestly, one of the biggest reasons why I don't try to do reviews for sh*t like this and Planescape: Torment is because I'd have to write up an entire f*cking essay to even begin to do these things justice.

76561197998141809,14,Project Warlock,"Action, Indie",Recommended,"Hm, well the game is mostly 2d, much like wolf3d (oh irony), and this is reflected in the fact that space is use instead of jump. In fact, there is no jump button, just like wolf3d. And Doom. And Heretic. Etc. There are a handful of semi-3d bits here and there, where you take a lift to a higher or lower location, but for the most part the game plays entirely on 2 axes. It's also kinda buggy and causes ground flames to either fall through the floor or rise past the ceiling. The level design is labyrinthe just like wolf3d, but there's a lot more variety in the wall textures/decoration, so you won't get lost as easily. I still got lost several times tho. Weapons. This game has many of them. And they can all be turned into something better and more fun to play with. There's very minimal exploration to be had in this game so the shooting of the things in the face til they die is the bread and butter of this game. If you like mindlessly shooting things til they go BOOM or SPLAT or whatever, you'll probably like this game. Every episode is a totally different environment with completely different enemies. My personal favorite was the futuristic city with the soldiers and the robots and stuff. The medieval castle area was pretty cool too. Also there's the John Carpenter's The Thing inspired arctic-y area with yetis and lovecraftian eldritch abominations and whatnot. Also parka wearing motherfuc*ers that sometimes turn into weird fleshy blob monsters that violate you with tentacles that pop up from the ground. The bosses are kinda pathetically easy tbh. Or maybe I've just gotten really good at these since I've been playing a shi*ton of boomer shooters lately. But yeah no, the bosses are kinda on the easy side, they're mostly just bullet spongy. I would've preferred something with more actual challenge instead of just wearing down a massive health bar. Also the first boss seems kinda buggy. If you stand directly underneath him in his last form he just sits there doing nothing. But you also can't hit him back. Despite Dusk and Amid Evil feeling a lot more polished and generally much higher quality overall, I surprisingly had a lot more fun with this game. It's cause the weapons and shooting sh*t with those weapons is just so much fun and so go*damn satisfying. Also being able to upgrade those weapons to something EVEN BETTER. And level ups.

76561197998141809,16,Kohan: Ahriman's Gift,Strategy,Recommended,"The original Kohan is one of the best rts games ever made and this just makes it so much better. The campaign is slightly harder but still p*ss easy. But seriously, don't give the enemy archers magic arrows you f*cking c*nts. That's b*llshit. You literally just made my spooky scary skeletons completely useless. But yeah, the single biggest change to the game is the inclusion of like a half dozen more faction unique units. Now you actually have a real reason to play council over royalist or nationalist! And the Ceyah are even more unique than they used to be. Also goat archers are the best units in the game. No exceptions. So like, this is my favorite rts ever, you can see that by the literally +3000h of gametime I have with it, but the one criticism I have with it is that the pathfinding in this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ atrocious. Sometimes units will get so stuck and confused that they literally just stand there for like half a minute even when whatever was blocking them is long gone. It reminds me of the sh*tty pathfinding from Baldur's Gate 2, except I'm pretty sure in bg2 the characters would keep moving around trying to find a path to their destination instead of just standing there idly fingering their *ssholes while getting shot to death by archers and sh*t. Oh and one other thing I want to say is that the game is not your typical rts. It feels more like they made a real time wargame. It borrows a lot of concepts from wargames like morale, and various zones like zones of control and supply. There's also basically no base building compared to a typical rts. You have no economic/worker units aside from the engineers (kind of) and the settlers. Engineers only have 3 noncombat/work related functions: constructing mines on resources, building forts to extend your zones of supply and defend your territory, and repairing sh*t. Settlers are only used to make new cities, which contain all your production and recruitment buildings. These do not exist as separate entities on the map, but rather are housed within the city itself in the form of a convenient menu.","4,620.5 hrs on record																					(4,619.4 hrs at review time)",N/A

Most porn games are cheap, low quality sh*te designed to make a buck using sex as it's only selling point. This is one of those games that're actually good enough to stand on it's own merits even if all the prons were removed. And this is coming from a guy who f*ckin hates most match 3 games. The biggest tweaks to the core match 3 gameplay is the inclusion of upgrades/level up mechanics and what are basically one time use spells. The upgrade system is pretty straight forward, spent points to make your numbers bigger. Figuring out how to use the spells properly is more or less essential to beating the game at the later stages/higher difficulties. The ""Make the girl have an or*asm via match 3"" minigame is pretty meh, you can't lose and you just spam matches as quickly as you can. It feels pretty uninspired compared to the rest of the game.

Another thing, major organs not stacking, thus taking up your entire inventory. And the fact that your inventory is so pathetically small. And since there are no equipment slots, your tools and such take up like half of it. Oh, and it'd be nice if the monsters in the dungeon respawned, and if the surface world monsters wouldn't just magically despawn at midnight and midday.

76561197998141809,22,Kohan II: Kings of War,Strategy,Recommended,"I... really didn't like this game too much. It feels super dumbed down compared to the original, and the jump to 3d models looks hideous compared to the original's beautiful 2d artwork. Also they took out the Slaanri. WHY. That was like the most interesting race in that game. Turtlemen are super rare in videogames that aren't about pizza eating ninjas. The other races are literally just orcs, dwarves, elves and of course, the ubiqutous humans, all of which are super generic and commonplace in fantasy games. Also the whole just researching technology makes the game feel too much like another generic rts. On the other hand, I do like how you can have bigger formations, and it's a lot easier to retreat, no more having to press multiple buttons to run away anymore. They also expanded the npc races into fully playable races all their own, although in the process they took away the 3 different human nations and turned them into ""factions,"" which are like perks basically, and every playable race has to pick one. I also like how every city gets walls by default once you upgrade it, and it has it's own workers to repair stuff for you, and each building is represented, so you can manually target and destroy buildings, walls be damned. Judged by it's own merits, it's certainly not a bad rts, but as a kohan game, I feel like it tripped over it's own feet and fell flat on it's face. Kind of a shame, cause the first two Kohan games are literally my favorites rts games ever.

76561197998141809,22,Elise the Devil,"Adventure, Indie, RPG",Recommended,"Personally I find this game to be quite charming. It's like an old school jrpg but with a lot more t*ts and canola. And seeing as how I grew up with both jrpgs and eroges, stuff like this is quite nostalgic <3 My favorite part of this was the protag and her interactions with the rest of the cast. The artwork is pretty good imo, around 7 or 8, and it has plenty of both hardcore fetishy r*pe scenes as well as more vanilla consensual stuff if that's more your thing. The gameplay is reasonable. Nothing amazing, it's meant mostly for t*tillation purposes after all, but it's about on the level of a basic snes era jrpg except a million times less grindy. The game overall is rather short, you can easily beat it in a day or two. The dungeons are super compact, and if you get tired of random encounters there are two rings that respectively reduce and eliminate them. It's also super easy, so if you're looking for a deep and meaningful rpg, this really isn't it. What it is is nice sex scenes, a super cliche but still more or less enjoyable story, and cliche but likable enough characters (if you're the type that likes generic, cliche anime characters anyways) with some basic rpg gameplay to make it more interesting than just a sh*tty hentai slideshow. One thing to note, a certain character that joins you after the branch gets reset between playthroughs, so don't equip anything on them that you don't want to lose in ng+, and leveling them up is kind of a waste of time. You'll know which character this is cause they ain't like the others. The other characters that briefly join you retain their levels and items though. Also, don't worry about losing at boss fights, the game lets you immediately restart from outside the room and is actually how you'll get like half the scenes. Also, when it comes to branches, the game lets you go back to them after getting an ending until you get the canonical true ending. Also, as with basically all games pubbed by SakuraGame, sh*tty machine translation. That being said, it's very understandable, just don't go in expecting Shakespeare or anything. Also some of the translations are hilariously f*cking stupid sounding. Like random oink noises during sex and whatnot.",24.4 hrs on record																					(3.7 hrs at review time),N/A

76561197998141809,22,Dying Light,"Action, RPG",Recommended,"Seriously? It's like they took everything they learned from making Dead Island and improved on and polished it til you get this little gem right here. Well I mean the story is still your typical cliche nonsense but the gameplay is so so much better. For one, there are LOADS of active skills you can unlock and use like the ability to throw zombies around, drop kick them, stomp on their faces, slide into them, etc. And due to the way the game works, you can max out all your skill trees with nothing more than a little time and patience. Unlike in Dead Island, the guns are actually useful and the gunplay is much better. Heck, it's good enough that you could just go around guns blazing and not even bother using melee weapons. The downside to that is noise makes fast zombies spawn and swarm your @ss like a bunch of killer bees after disturbing their nest. Also bullets. You cannot make them period. Same applies to any kind of explosives. Grenades, explosive barrels found in the environment naturally and the like will all attract attention, so there's a certain risk/reward balance to using guns and other loud means of killing zombies. Do you go around shooting everything and causing big explosions that'll cause nigh endless waves of fast zombies trying to have your @ss for dinner, or do you go about your business quietly and use melee weapons, unarmed techniques, the environmental traps that aren't super loud and the bow and crossbow? One thing I like about this game is that during missions involving human enemies and room clearing, you can actually stealth them so long as you don't get caught, cause if you do, everyone magically becomes aware of your presence and remain on red alert until you get rid of them all. But yeah, being able to stealth stuff like that in a game like this which really isn't meant for that feels very satisfying. One other thing I kinda disliked, but only applies to The Following dlc, is how the zombies can outrun your car when you only have level 1 parts equipped. You do seem to get way faster when you get offroad suspension, but seriously, a zombie on foot can outrun a flipping car? Seriously come the f*ck on :| It's utter nonsense I tell ya Semi related to that, I hate the way every volatile and viral goes nuts whenever you attack one of them, even if you manage to do so silently. If I one shot a zombo with my crossbow, you'd think that wouldn't set them off. So yeah, that's one of the few things I actually dislike about this game. Another thing I liked about this game is being able to completely stealth any mission involving clearing a building of hostile humans. The game's really not meant for that, but it's still possible nonetheless, so long as you don't get spotted, cause if you do, everyone magically knows you're there and they remain on red alert til you hunt down and finish off every last one of them, cause mgs or sc this ain't. That being said, it's super satisfying to stealth an entire mission in this way in a game that really wasn't meant to be played this way. Course it really helps to have a bow (preferably bozak or ranger, cause the regular bow you get in game is a smelly piece of rancid dogsh*t) or a crossbow and some of the stealhier skills like the takedown from behind. You could just rely on using some melee weapons like an axe or machete, but that's not quite as reliable as the ol vertebral realignment. One of the best changes I feel was getting rid of the workbenches. You do all your crafting in the field and you never have to interrupt the natural flow of gameplay to go find a stupid bench so you can make a million molotovs to throw at zombies. You just put the stuff together on the spot and bam, you got things to use. There is one last thing I feel is kinda really pointless and a bit annoying: repair slots. This really doesn't add much to the game. It just forces you to continually replace your weapons as they wear down. But the thing is, you can also find socketable gems just like in diablo. Thing is, you can't remove them. So if your weapon breaks down permanently, say goodbye to all those upgrade gems. There is one, ONE way to get around this, and that is to do blue shield escort missions. Problem is, they only show up roughly 28% through the game, and even then, it's kind of a crapshoot getting them to appear, and sometimes the guy just flat out f*cking dies while you're trying to make him not die. Then you have to wait literally forever for it to respawn again. That being said, once you have some really great weapons, you won't have to repair it all that much, and there are TONS of ways to kill the zombies without weapons. Like drop kicking or sliding into them and pushing them into a spike trap or onto a car fire. Tossing them off of cliffs and the like. Using the slide kick to lame them all then stomp all their faces into mush. Or using the stun reversal followed up with the stun kill move to instakill them. Or using the vault stun followed up by a stun kill or a takedown from behind. There are @ssloads of ways to kill the zombies without ever necessitating use of any kind of weapon at all. I liked Dead Island but it was a tad basic. This game really fixes that I think. Also parkour. I think more fps should do this and allow you to climb ontop of things you should logically be able to climb onto, none of that can't jump over a waist high barrier nonsense. Seriously, I'm not an 80yo geriatric with a back problem and who requires a cane to get around. It's just flatout ludicrous when you come across something like that in a videogame and it's pretty immersion breaking. Why not just make it look like you cannot pass at all? I think that'd be a lot better. Like Dying Light gets over that problem by putting barbed wire ontop of the fences you can't climb over. That makes really good sense and is a clever way to handle this problem. Also, that last boss fight? Kind of a disappointment. If you're going to do it that way, please make it more satisfying than that? I really really like this game. This is one of the best games I've played in a very long time. While I did get this on sale cause I'm a skinflint, this is well worth full price. Also I highly recommend getting the following with this if for nothing else than the crossbow. That is easily the best weapon in the entire game. Although the semi auto shotgun is still the best for panic situations or just raw firepower.

It's a much better port than Conviction was ie smoother aiming, and it's just a lot of fun overall. And it's super easy to recover if you futz a headshot (mostly due to the better mouse aiming). I like that the game gives you various options for dealing with situations. Go loud, stalk and kill, or completely evade everyone. When you manage to beat an entire level without using any items and without disturbing anyone and never being seen at all, it feels so satisfying. You really are like a ghost. The most professional of spies. No lightbulbs shot, no cameras disabled, no guards knocked out, not even any smoke grenades tossed. In and out without anyone ever knowing you were even there. Or, if you'd rather just stealth headshot everyone wiht a silenced sniper rifle, you can do that too. Or quietly stalk and kill everyone with melee from behind or above, like a real panther. Or if you get bored of that, load up on loud weapons and hand grenades and intentionally make as much noise as possible. Just wanted to add that after doing a bit of a workaround and figuring out how to get it to work properly, I actually did manage to activate the dlcs for this game.

It's point and click the way the original Grim Fandango was point and click: all the pointing and clicking was replaced by an entirely keyboard driven interface, but otherwise plays exactly the same as a traditional pnc type adventure game. One of my favorite things about this game is that the puzzles were never so hard that I needed to use a walkthrough to complete it. I was *very* tempted to at several parts though. And like a lot of other people who've played and reviewed this game, I can relate to/identify with this story and protag on an intimately personal level. Depression is like the worst f*cking thing in the whole world. You wake in the morning and refuse to get out of bed because what's the f*cking point, you have no reason to so you just lie there for a good 2-4 hours before finally dragging yourself out of bed because lying there just makes you feel even worse, plus you need to eat breakfast, p*ss, and brush your teeth or else you'll get a tooth infection again, which causes brutal f*cking agony that gets progressively worse over time, and keeps you awake the whole night long, and is so bad that when the dentist sticks the needle in your gums, the pain of the needle feels like a relief in comparison to the agony of your dying tooth. Food barely has any taste anymore. All your favorite things in the world bring you no joy because they become f*cking meaningless. You feel constantly bored and apathetic and emotionally numb and empty inside. You physically feel pain less because your senses are numbed. You feel EVERYTHING less intensely because of dulled senses. You don't feel happy or sad or angry or whatever. You feel nothing. All day, every day. For 16 straight years. And jerking off? That's not fun anymore. That just becomes another bothersome chore like brushing your teeth or taking a p*ss or a shower. Maybe you start overeating even when you're not hungry just to comfort yourself and start gaining weight. Maybe later on you start getting super stressed out and lose your appetite and start losing weight like crazy to the point where you become scared of becoming anorexic. You try to have a regular sleep schedule but that totally falls apart within months, maybe weeks. You just wake up and go to bed whenever you feel like it. Even though it bores the sh*t out of you, you just mindlessly stare at the computer monitor all day long until your brain is so tired that you can't stay awake anymore, but trying to go to bed earlier than that causes you to just lie in bed for hours on end tortured by anxiety that worsens the longer you are unable to sleep. Sometimes you go to bed in the middle of the day even when you're not tired simply because you have nothing better to do and would rather just sleep every day away. I've barely left my room in the past 11 years. I used to be able to run all the way home from school. Now I can run for maybe 5 seconds before becoming winded. My arms are so atrophied from lack of use that they have become pathetically weak. I cannot open any jars without using tools to help me. My bones are so weak that my hand broke cause someone grabbed it too hard. It didn't heal properly so now it's permanently f*cked. Forever. I used to be able to do 50 push ups. Now I'm lucky if I can manage 5. You stop caring if you live or die. You're not living anymore, you're merely surviving. Just running down the clock until everything ends forever.

It'd be nice if there were more usable items instead of just bombs of varying strengths (how about healing items or items that absorb damage for a turn or something?). The writing, story and characters are not amazing, but passable. Ending's a bit weak and unsatisfying. My only real complaint with this game is how short it is. Improve the writing, make the story and characters better, and most of all, make the game longer. Or make it an episodic thing. Also I absolutely despised that one mission with limited resources.

I'm only giving this a no cause I personally couldn't stand the grinding. Honestly, my biggest problem with this game is that some materials are just way too hard to get in any kind of significant quantities. To get around this problem I suggest having higher tier enemies drop rarer materials instead of the common materials I already have literally hundreds of that all the lower tier enemies already drop.

It has many different classes, challenges and it is quite balanced. It's not punishing, rather chill. I don't get why this isn't much more popular. Edit after 38 hours of play: well, I'm no longer so positive about the game. I ran into some issues that spoil the fun after a while. I think many parts of the UI could have easily be improved upon. As it is, I spent a lot of time endlessly scrolling through different lists (9 different quest lists for unlocking gear, one long inventory list). Allowing to hide finished quests would be a welcome option, combining the quest lists into 1 master list would also have been nice. I also spent a lot of time chasing certain NPC's on the village map. Again, time lost due to an oversight in usability. Furthermore, I got frustrated a few times when the game doesn't explain properly, how to use certain class items or properties. For instance, one character wants you to ""put items in the path of your core"", while I coudln't find out how the core itself could have a path or what that meant. Otherwise, I quite enjoyed the less tedious parts of it. I just wish the devs would have gone the extra mile.

76561198812088447,2,ENDLESS™ Space - Definitive Edition,Strategy,Recommended,"I find this game disappointing on a number of levels, and will probably even remove it from my library at some point. At first I was positively surprised by the colorful graphics and good-looking menu systems. The way planets are displayed, the colors of icons, the graphical design of the UI, I loved it. But frustration set in pretty soon. The tutorial does a really bad job of introducing game elements, being at once boring and much too concise about key aspects of the game. I think I'd rather have read a PDF. Then there's the design of the tech tree. While it looks novel with it's circular layout, I quickly became irritated at the amount of scrolling it requires. The farther into a game, the more techs are found outward from the center. Moving from one extreme of the tech ""wheel"" to the other requires a lot of work, and as long as you don't know where to find what techs, you'll spend lots of time browsing this huge and inefficient layout. The AI is both cheating and dumb. After a successful war on my part, I managed to reduce an enemy empire to one planet only. They signed a 10-turn peace treaty with me, only to declare war on me 3 turns later because I was considered ""a threat"". So AI is allowed to break peace treaty, and AI will declare war without any chance of winning? Gotcha. I also dislike the number of turns spent just waiting for things to happen, the tedious micro, the way ship design is never clearly explained, how the hero ability tree overview is a blurry JPG without info, and I dislike the music and ambient sounds. All this lead me to feel empty, alone and bored while playing this game. When it comes to space 4X, I definitely recommend Galactic Civilizations II over this game. It doesn't have as nice graphics but the gameplay, menus, tech tree, game manual as PDF (!), ship design and AI are IMO vastly superior to Endless Space.",12.5 hrs on record,N/A
76561198812088447,2,Deep Sky Derelicts,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"Deep Sky Derelicts is a turn-based sci-fi dungeon crawler with RPG elements. It has a distinctive style that reminds me of early works of the french comic artist Enki Bilal, and that's what drew me to it in the first place. The game does not explain things very well. When going to a derelict (a dungeon) you navigate it on a map. This map is made of squares, some of which have symbols (circle, triangle, dash, slash, etc.) on them. But there is no explanation or even a legend of these symbols. Some of them offer a little more information, like ""Sandstorm"", but it won't tell you that it will damage your team by moving through it. I just had my squad wiped after a 5 hour run by moving through otherwise inconspicuous tiles in the derelict. Damn I hate that. But also in combat, the game doesn't explain things very well. Enemies show what buffs they have, and how many, with beautiful icons. When hovering over them, the game shows you the name of the buff, but not what it does. That makes it really hard to know what's going on. Some debuffs don't seem to have icons. Some cards do a percentage of weapon damage, but they never tell you if it will be based on the ranged or on the melee weapon. If you have a card that deals damage based on the melee damage, but have no melee weapon equipped, that attack will deal almost no damage. But you'll only find out during combat, by seeing the animation done, because the game has no other way of telling you. And then there's the balancing. My latest team was steamrolling levels 1-4, when all of a sudden they hit a brick wall at level 5. They met a group of enemies (red hoods) who magically resisted, evaded or otherwise nullified 75% of all my attacks. I couldn't believe my eyes. Out of the blue. Then there's the matter of having to do quests, but you don't know who for. Or the game tells you who it's for, but you have no idea where to find this person because it doesn't tell you. Or a quest tells you to gather X enemy artifacts, but forgets to tell you in what derelict to find those enemies. Then there's the matter of the paid DLC's. These DLC's contain such basic improvements, and so little of them, that I (and many others) believe they should just have released them as free updates to the base game. Hitboxes are another annoyance. Sometimes it's impossible to hit an enemy if they stand behind a bigger enemy. The game allows attacking the smaller enemy, it's just impossible to click on it. Also, because enemies are animated, an attack sometimes targets a wrong enemy because at the exact time I clicked, an enemy animation switches the hitbox to another enemy. Frustrating. The game also refused to load once, in 9 hours of play. Given all the above, I find that bad form. Deep Sky Derelicts showed some promise in the beginning, but shot itself in the foot by not paying attention to user-friendliness, balancing, and by being greedy. It's a shame because otherwise I love the concept and style very much. 5/10",15.3 hrs on record																					(9.4 hrs at review time),N/A

I love that there are different classes of gladiators, random favor cards, random events and that there are surprises of many kinds. I even like how tough it is to get to the end.

76561198812088447,2,XCOM® 2,Strategy,Recommended,"XCOM 2 is a turn-based tactical game, in which the earth is overrun by aliens and the player is chosen to lead the human resistance movement, XCOM. XCOM operates from a base which has research facilities and an engineering station which provide many new items, upgrades and tactical advantages. Recruits are managed in the armory, where classes are picked and promotions given once a soldier survives enough missions. Missions are the core of XCOM. They take place on many different maps, each of which offers different tactical challenges and opportunities. At first the aliens encountered on these maps don't present that much of a threat. But as the game progresses, the story unfolds, and XCOM grows stronger, so do the aliens. And depending on the difficulty level, they can obtain almost obscene strength. To the point where you almost have to be a masochist to enjoy it anymore. XCOM 2 is the successor to the massively popular XCOM: Enemy Within from 2013. That game was one of my top 10 games ever. So, how does XCOM 2 compare to the classic EW? Improved: - Graphics: maps are colorful, armor, weapons and item design is definitely more inspired, particle effects more impressive (check my screenshots here https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198812088447/screenshots/?appid=268500&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall) - Metagame: base building is more extensive than ever, the research tree is longer, there is more of everything - Music: since the War of the Chosen DLC you can chose from three different soundtracks, and they all work. Impressive! Same-ish - Story: both games convincingly transmit the desperate feeling that the aliens will win, that all is lost - Bradford (but whether that's a good thing...) I disliked: - Most missions are now on a timer. This changes everything. Unless you install a mod that disables the timer (which luckily, there is!) the game no longer gives you the freedom to plan for a perfect strategy - Somehow I am less invested in the story. My brain knows that XCOM 2 improved on every level, but I still enjoy playing XCOM: EW more. EW takes itself a little less serious, it is less dystopian and while the graphics are not as impressive, they sure have more of an outspoken character. - Download size: XCOM 2 with all DLC comes in at a hefty 70 GB! I still can't believe it. Sure, it looks good, but it's far from next gen. - XCOM 2 has bugs that seriously spoil the fun. Indicators that don't reliably preview enemy activation or line of sight, terrain that inexplicably destroys itself, and most aggravating of all: an increasing lag in the final mission. I have to wait three seconds for squad members to react to commands. 7 squad members, times 2 actions, times three seconds means 42 seconds lost to needless waiting every turn! Given the Youtube and Twitch campaigns that I followed online, this is quite a common problem too. All in all, I think XCOM 2 is a solid 7/10 game. It's hard not to recommend it, but there are many games which I find more perfect. I would recommend XCOM 2 to my friends only if they have already played these other games. That said, I think if you are into turn-based tactical games, this title will not disappoint.
