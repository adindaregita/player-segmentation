76561199076918197,1.0,Max Payne 3,Recommended,"This game saved my life. I am 22. My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old. When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide. After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side. Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labour"". I relaxed for 5 whole minutes to this music long enough to realise that I was going to be okay. After coming to that realisation, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as. Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends. I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together. Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realise that. Thank you",9.1 hrs on record																					(8.7 hrs at review time),N/A,

76561198011803825,1.0,The Binding of Isaac: Repentance,Recommended,"If you're new to Isaac, consider holding off on this DLC until you have dived further into the game, namely once you've defeated the Cathedral and Seoul bosses a few times. By that point you'll probably know by then if you want to progress any further. A big point to note about Repentance is that the target audience is people who have already played up to the Afterbirth+ expansion and want more challenges. For this reason, this DLC will be VERY hard for newcomers and casual players. Whilst there are a bunch of quality of life changes and some really neat new items, a lot of the content (namely the new floors and new characters) are locked behind some challenging barriers, with a lot of the really cool items you might have seen on youtube or something being locked behind some of the most challenging content the game has to offer. But for me, this DLC has gotten me hooked on the game again, so I recommend C:",0.0 hrs on record,N/A,

76561198011803825,1.0,DARK SOULS‚Ñ¢: Prepare To Die‚Ñ¢ Edition,Recommended,"This game is one of the worst ports ever to grace modern PC gaming. A cap of 30 frames per second, 720p limit, Games for Windows Live integration and impossible-to-use mouse + keyboard controls makes playing Dark Souls on the PC a chore. That is, before you install a mod called DSFix. Suddenly, most of these problems disappear, and now you can enjoy one of the best, yet incredibly overrated action RPGs to date. Often people cite Dark Soul's difficulty as one of the strongest points, but it's not so much difficult as it is punishing. Idiot moves will often result in a quick death, and further idiot moves will result in a loss of the souls you have collected, a significant setback for your character's progression. As opposed to the instance-based Demon Souls, Dark Souls is an open-world title where you fight through insanely atmospheric environments to grow stronger and defeat incredibly tough boss monsters. It began as a niche title due to it's old-school RPG gameplay mechanics but soon found a large cult following from it's PC release despite all of it's obvious pre-DSfix problems. It's often quoted as the GOTAY but frankly there are plenty of glaring flaws with it as well. The first half of the game where you learn how to not die every five minutes is exciting, and full of incredible environments which rise your exploration-boner to heights which you've never seen, but once you've understood the combat mechanics well enough and reach the second half of the game things seem to slow down quite a bit. You're faced with uninspired areas, a few boring bosses, and an anti-climactic ending. As soon as you understand how to parry hits and dodge properly the game almost becomes trivial. Though you must understand that I only feel the need to criticise this title due to the overwhelming respect I have for it. Combat is responsive feels weighty, as huge swords and maces should. The integrated multiplayer into the single player experience is incredible, allowing plays to leave behind hints and messages for people in other games to come across, as well as be summoned into other player's worlds to help them progress. In total your first playthrough should accumulate about 50+ hours of unique game content, which is more than enough for what you pay for. Unfortunately, as I said at the beginning, you need to jump through a few hurdles to get to the fun, of which includes buying a controller before you play. A large investment for one game, but I highly doubt you'll be disappointed with what Dark Souls has to offer.",98.8 hrs on record																					(91.5 hrs at review time),N/A,
76561198011803825,1.0,Garry's Mod,Recommended,"It's hard to accurately describe WHAT Garry's Mod is as a video game. If anything: It's a platform thanks to the ease of downloading a seemingly infinite number of user-created models/toys/vehicles/weapons/what-have-you to play with. There are no goals to Gmod's default sandbox mode. Everything is limited by your imagination, which is a good and bad thing. Good in the sense that creativity is rewarded with the creation of silly, yet potentially complex contraptions which you can drive, detonate, ride, fling etc. But bad in the sense of how well game with no goal can keep you occupied for an extended period of time. The real fun of Garry's Mod spawns from building your own enjoyment with your friends! Multiplayer is where this game truely shines, allowing for a massive level of server modding and customisation. You're not only restricted to building stuff in this game. Want to play a game of who-dunnit where detectives try to discover discreet murderers among their ranks? Want to watch Youtube videos in a virtual cinema with friends? Hide and seek? Roleplay? Survival? All of this and more is avaliable thanks to Gmod's incredible modding community. Unfortunately, to gain the full experience from this title, other Source games like Counter-Strike: Source and Half-Life 2 are strongly recommended to make use of their assets. You have to find your own fun with Garry's Mod, but once you've found it expect your play time to skyrocket.",226.9 hrs on record																					(209.1 hrs at review time),N/A,

76561198402102247,4.0,N/A,Recommended,"although it had a rough launch + the stupid EPG 1 year exclusivity, Hitman 3 holds (or at least tries) to what makes these games fun. the fact that you get all 3 games in one for half the space (now it's 65~ GB for all 3 games) makes it very accessible to play the trilogy. what makes these games special is the creativity and freedom it allows you to play with. for every mission there are a lot of unique scenarios that totally depends on the player style and approach. although this game is so much fun and does some things well, it doesn't improve much and I still think Hitman 2 is the best part for the following reasons: ------ - Hitman3 has less maps than Hitman 1&2 - some maps feel linear and doen't offer the variety that Hitman2 offered. - A.I is dumb, and I mean REALLY DUMB. - so many glitches and some NPCs walk through walls or appear out of nowhere - still needs an internet connection to play and the servers are terrible. - IOI sell the games as DLCs just to confuse you into buying stuff you don't want at all.",24.7 hrs on record																					(9.4 hrs at review time),N/A,

76561199041275399,4.0,Wolfenstein: Youngblood,Recommended,"I ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• hate this game. I feel like I have been robbed. I normally wouldnt sit down and write a serious review, but I have had a few drinks and I am really ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• angry. This game is everything the original Wolfenstein games (The old blood, The new order, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• hell even the new Colossus) arent. I have been greatly disappointed by this cow ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, and hope and pray to God that I get my money back. This is not worth six dollars, I could buy two packs of red Marlboro with this money, which will be better for my health than this game. I dont even know where to begin. The gameplay I suppose. So, you know how in the other Wolfenstein games you can feel the power of your weapon, even when shooting Supersoldaten or any other strong enemies? In this game you cant even feel the power of your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• assault rifle when shooting a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• man with no armor. IN THE ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• HEAD. He takes it like a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• nerf gun shot. This goes for all weapons and all enemies, no weight, no power. You love the executions with the pipes in the old blood? The knife in the new order? The hatchet in the new colossus? The satisfying animations, the variety of different animations, the bloody nature of them? How there are so many for the different angles and positions you might attack an enemy in? You got none of that here. There are like three, and they are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• terrible and feel unfinished. The main one (if it even works, because I have noticed that due to the lack of variety, somethimes no animation plays and the enemy just dies) is you killing the enemy with their own gun. Again, feels very light, no weight to the gun, nor the shot, and there is not even muzzle flash. After that, you just return to the gun you were previously with, with no animation, just their gun despawning from your hands, your gun spawning. The stealth kill animation is just one (I have done several takedowns and it was the same), while kind of satisfying at first, gets repetative really quick, because again, IT IS ONE ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ANIMATION. I am talking so much about takedown animations because I loved them in the old blood, loved them even more in the new order, and loved them EVEN MORE in the new colossus. The first time I pressed middle mouse button I was excited to see what they had done this time, I expected something good, something satisfying, and then a giant ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• came into my ass, destroying every single particle of joy that I had left in my body. Next we should talk AI. It is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• retarded. Sometimes it sees you, sometimes it doesnt. Sometimes it decides to shoot at you, sometimes it doesnt. They never act like actual soldiers, more like a blind and deaf people trying to find their way out of a maze, on a timer, while handling heavy weaponary incorrectly. The characters are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• terrible, I neednt say more, my garlic bread is ready finally, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• this game.",1.3 hrs on record,N/A,
