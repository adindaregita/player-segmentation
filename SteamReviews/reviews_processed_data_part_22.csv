76561198006906614,1,N/A,Recommended,"It's astounding how the writing manages to swing between reprehensibly morbid and surprisingly wholesome. The protagonists manage to be both deranged yet also oddly lovable. Their chemistry is apparent from the first minutes on, and the spritework underlines every bit of snark perfectly. Yes, it's a highly abusive sibling relationship. Yes, they do horrible things. Yes, Ashley is clearly psychotic. But damn me if the way she's written doesn't make her appealing, funny and even cute, despite also being terrifying. It's a testament to the author's skill that dialog never feels cringe, either.",2.2 hrs on record																					(1.6 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198006906614,1,N/A,Recommended,"An excellent showcase of how difficult solving the climate catastrophe becomes when you leave everything to the last minute, putting solutions we already have right now off in favor of hypothetical future solutions. Balancing resources without overstretching and quick reactions to events are key to success here, lest the ramping-up difficulty spiral out of control. More than anything, however, I consider this an educational experience which not only illustrates the devastating effects of climate tipping points, but also the wealth of available options of tackling the carbon emission problem right here and now - every bit counts, there is no simple one-step solution.",2.0 hrs on record																					(1.2 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198006906614,1,N/A,Recommended,"I finally got around to sitting down and playing A Short Hike last night, and before I knew it I was halfway through it. Not because it's all that short of a trip, but because it pulled me in, letting me forget time and stress. Gaming has been a tough proposition for me lately. Between stress, loud neighbors driving me to insomnia again this past month and a general sense of uneasiness preventing me from just starting up a new game , it's been difficult for me to simply sit down and enjoy what's coming for me. That's the situation I was in for a long while with this game: Keeping it installed for months, but never feeling in the right mindset to properly appreciate what has been widely regarded as a great, earnest indie title. Booting it up was more on a whim than any conscious decision on my part. I just happened to do it. And then I didn't quit for ages, something few games these days achieve. And even when I reached a point where I thought I had enough for the time being.... it didn't last. I went out to get a cup of hot chocolate, go to the bathroom, and when I got back to the PC, I found myself just booting the game back up. Even when I found myself getting frustrated on being two seconds over the required boat race time for an achievement (and knowing it was my own silly mistake that cost me that victory!) I only shut it down for maybe half an hour, watching a brief video on Youtube, before going back to the island and trying again. And succeeding. I finished the entire game in a single night, sans a PC clock-dependent achievement I unlocked just a bit ago, putting the game officially at 100% completion. And I feel myself both happy at the short, unhurried, relaxing experience, and wishing there had been another adventure to bring me back right now. Turns out I was wrong. You don't need the perfect mindset to go into A Short Hike. You just need to bring yourself to attend - the game does the rest. It'll put you in that bright mindset through its own charms, its character writing, the atmosphere of the island and its lack of intrinsic pressures. It'll go at your pace, instead of demanding you make that effort yourself. It'll leave you to wander and explore, to meet characters that turn out to be lovable, quirky people that - at the end of the day - mean nobody any harm. There are no debbie downers - even characters you may instinctively dislike (scalping is bad, yo) turn out to have valid, personal reasons for doing what they're doing... and when you offer them kindness instead of bitterness, you both win. I think that's my biggest takeaway from A Short Hike: The kindness within every single person you meet. No matter how competitive they might be, they're never malicious. They'll support their rivals instead of wallowing in Schadenfreude. They'll reflect on their own actions and choices, their own preconceptions. They'll overcome self-doubt with the help of a little bit of encouragement from the player-character Claire. Claire herself may start out feeling a little snarky and disinterested in her surroundings - you could even say cynical - but once she steps out of the house and goes on her hike, she starts to see the island and the people inhabiting it the way it actually is: Beautiful and harmonious. I was lucky enough to share both that sense of trepidation going into the game, and that sense of wonder inherent in its exploration. And reaching the top of the mountain, I felt kinship with Claire - we made this hike a success! It was only then that I recalled the reason for it all when Claire's phone rang, right there at the peak - the only point with cellphone reception on the island. And I cried over the dialogue that followed. It was a sort of fulfillment that made the experience all the more worthwhile. It explained Claire's initial frustration, while framing it not as rooted in boredom or a rejection of the island, but instead in her kind heart. It made all the friends made along the way feel even more meaningful in hindsight. But the game didn't end there. With the climb achieved, I felt like the island opened up to me even more than before - when really, it hadn't changed, outside of character dialogue advancing here and there. I'd achieved Claire's own, personal goal... but there were still others who hadn't fulfilled their own. And I got to help them getting there now. By the end of the adventure, Claire has the chance to talk to her aunt back at their cabin. She tells her of this and that adventure, all things you could achieve throughout the game. She's gushing about what a great time she had. And both Claire and myself could've gone on for far longer than she actually did in those lines of dialogue. Because there were more little things not explicitly mentioned, more meaningful moments, treasures, people, experiences that I was happy I had made that night I beat A Short Hike on a whim.",5.7 hrs on record																					(4.8 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198006906614,1,N/A,Recommended,"At last, they've decided to require an additional layer of account-based DRM starting with Season 6: EGS. This was sadly inevitable after the development studio was purchased by Epic a while back, after their explosive hit launch. So Fall Guys is firmly going the way of the dodo, requiring an off-site account, changing the TOS over a year after launch, and as a result, I will not even be able to play the product I originally purchased, as I will not be sharing my personal & analytical data with Epic Games. A pity that a refund will not be forthcoming, same as it wasn't when Rocket League pulled this same stunt a few years back.",2.7 hrs on record,N/A
76561198006906614,1,N/A,Recommended,"Menu bloat, thy name is Honkai Impact 3rd. If you've never experienced how nightmarish some mobile gacha games can be in terms of navigating menus, multitudes of shop interfaces, upgrade screens, missions, activities and the likes, THIS is the game to check out, because oh boy, does it bring its A-Game when it comes to confusing new players. I've tried to play HI3 on multiple occasions over the years, both on tablet, emulator with gamepad, native PC client and now the Steam release of said client, but while the Steam version does not allow account linking , resetting everyone to the very beginning without any of their previously rolled characters, my experience of the game is built on multiple chances I gave the game since a friend bothered me enough to give it a shake or three. As a result, my playtime on Steam will not properly reflect my overall experience, just how my Steam-linked account does not reflect my ownership of super-limited Evangelion-crossover character Asuka. A pity. In other words: This review is targeted at interested newcomers more so than veterans, as I assume those will not want to give up on their existing accounts to play here anyway. The amount of different shop currencies, parallel mission lists, barely-explained tokens and yes, indeed, the gacha banner lists, are staggering. While it starts ""simple"" enough for first time players, the training gloves are truly off after the first story chapter. If you struggle at all with Choice Paralysis, I doubt you'll make it far into the game before giving up on it. Considering that the Steam release is also merely the standalone PC client in the up-to-date game version, with all the recent content, banners and promo events that entails, the amount of things a new player needs to quickly wrap their head around after leaving the bare-bones tutorial - which, honestly, isn't even over at that point, it just claims it is - is simply overwhelming. The missions, too, seem very much designed to feed into instant gratification for newcomers. No matter what you do, chances are, you'll have dozens of achievements unlocked within the first two hours, constantly chasing the next orange ""click here! something updated!-dot on UI elements. Raised a character's level? Here's some reward. Equipped a new weapon? Go and upgrade it, here's some cashback for doing so. Rolled a character? Here's an achievement. This wouldn't be such a big issue if it didn't on one hand detract from the actual gameplay by making you navigate endless menus, but the rewards themselves tend to be extremely lackluster, not to say stingy. miHoYo manages to, on the surface, shower the player with bling, but at the end of the day you'll actually have gained very little - or worse, stuff you don't even know the point of, or shop tokens that you cannot spend until you've raised your player level to one or other arbitrary milestone - and there are plenty of those. And suddenly some new banner unlocks because you reached player level x or beat story stage y, and it turns out, hey, what you might have already spent rolling may have been better-served going into that banner instead. Skill-unlocking, too, is nightmare fuel for UX designers. It's overly complex for what it is, and not fun. To put it plainly, Honkai Impact 3rd is hellish to navigate. Half the menus I was trying to get to had to be accessed through yet different menus, some places I still don't know where I would find them outside of ""Go Here"" buttons on missions, and it feels more like Playing Menus than a pseudo-spectacle fighter. Now, as for the proper gameplay, I have to caution that this is a mobile game. It's not going to play like Bayonetta, Devil May Cry, Metal Gear Rising or Darksiders. It certainly tries to, but it has three very big problems in achieving it: 1. The movement and camera controls. They're floaty, not properly adapted for gamepad, let alone mouse and keyboard controls. The camera in particular is a nightmare to get used to. It doesn't work as a full free movement camera you control with your right stick, but instead has more digital movement than analog. It's frequently getting in the way of the action, and while you can tweak it somewhat , it'll never be as smooth an experience as native non-mobile games designed with thumbsticks in mind. Movement is in a similar boat, especially with auto-targeting enabled. 2. Combat itself is pretty damn spammy. Once again, the mobile nature of the game rears its ugly head, as all attacks and evades are basically taps on the screen. While they do have dedicated buttons assigned for each action, they're not as responsive as you'd like them to be, making the game feel like it has severe input lag at times - and for all I can tell, it has that, anyway. Instead of having the typical light/heavy attacks and maybe a special, the usual character has one basic attack which you'll find yourself mashing a lot - or sometimes holding for a special move. There's an evade action, which can be timed properly for extra effects like slowdowns and special attacks, a special and an ultimate, both of which cost SP to use and recharge slow enough to not be used much in the story stages overall. While different characters may mix it up in their specifics, this is about it. The range of actions is severely limited, and especially non-challenge arena battles are easily beaten just pressing B over and over, adding X or Y when off-cooldown and flashing their buttons. If you want to get fancy, you switch in your active character, resulting in a combo attack, but then you go back to the same formula. Especially in the early game, combat feels not at all rewarding. 3. Stages, especially story and event ones, are extremely short. I mean it. If the stage has a bonus star requirement to beat it within 240 seconds, or maybe even 300, you can be sure that you'll have no trouble first-timing it in less than half that time. Story missions in particular keep. interrupting. you. You go a few steps, maybe trigger a trash fight, then have somebody try to tell you something, interrupting the flow of the stage. If you're lucky, you may experience this two or three times in a stage before it's over, you end with a cutscene / victory screen and move on to the next cutscene followed by a 30-60 second stage. You'll seriously have done more tutorialized menu navigating than actual fighting by the time you've cleared the first story chapter. The moment you get in the rhythm of fighting enemies, you'll be interrupted - often for ""press this button now"" tutorials, which can even mess up your combo or cause you to get hit as they interrupt your dodge. While this isn't a problem for longer-lasting difficult high-end content like arena wave battles, you cannot access that stuff until you've gotten further into the story and raised your player level - so for new players, this will be a nuisance. There's yet another point I'll mention as being a problem in some way, which is the visual presentation. While - my god - the animation and model work for most characters is godlike (have you SEEN some of these designs?!), with easily some of the prettiest characters in Gachaland, battle animations are frequently over-animated and full of particle effects that make keeping track of what's going on, especially dodge-cues, a challenge harder than the enemies themselves. A lot of the fun you'll have in combat is also directly related to who you enjoy playing as, and how you design your team. miHoYo is pretty hot on this style of game, as Genshin Impact attests to, but the inherent problem with this is that while you get a few basic choices early on, the vast bulk of playable characters need to be rolled for in the gacha - and the rates are anything but good, and currency is sparse and expensive. I'd speak on more if I had more room, but I hit the character limit already. My bad.",4.6 hrs on record																					(2.4 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198006906614,1,N/A,Recommended,"I honestly like this way of visualizing the story. It's atmospheric, and considering a lot of people struggle with HPL's writing on the page, this style might just be the trick to getting folks to actually diving into the stories as they are. The trivia bits are a great touch, too. I love that the team has obviously spent time researching HPL's life and literature, and references other third party literature on him. Lovecraft, in my opinion, gets a really bad reputation in the modern times because of how much of his writing and themes get taken out of context - or not even that, just how ignorant most people today are of the state of the times when he told his stories. His body of work spans decades, and many changes can be observed throughout, often related to changes in his personal life and environments. Having these trivia bits really helps giving the player an insight into the wider socio-political state of the world and the author's perspective. It's a great choice. I'd be confident in calling this game a ""Virtual Installation"", a term TotalBiscuit tried to coin way back in the day when games like Dear Esther and Gone Home were rising up. It's kind of like a guided museum tour - and in this case, I'm all for it. Illustrating these stories and conveying their atmosphere is one of the major points I look for in Mythos adaptations, and often, arbitrary gameplay loops just get in the way of the tension. It won't work for everyone - but that is to be expected. Hells, Lovecraft's stories don't work for everyone either. On the flipside, the short duration of the narrative should lend itself well towards catching the interest of new readers, without losing them halfway. Dagon is easily ""beatable"" (as silly as the term is in this instance) in under an hour, even at a leisurely pace. And since the title is free (as is the bulk of HPL's work; you can read most of his stories on Wikisource, for example), there's honestly no reason not to dive in. I will, however, present this caveat: You need to be in the right mindset to absorb the narrative and atmosphere. Rushing through it, or outside distractions, might take you out of the experience. Make sure to set aside a quiet hour, preferably in the evening or night when things quiet down outside, put on some headphones and lean back in your chair. Best to also turn off any secondary displays. Tunnel-vision on the experience for the greatest mileage, and maybe put aside the Trivia achievement hunt for a second playthrough, so as not to interrupt the story's flow too much by way of searching the environment. Either way, though, I'm glad Dagon exists in this format, and hope the developers will find a worthwhile niche in this style of narrative experience - I'd certainly love to see more of this!",1.0 hrs on record,N/A
76561198006906614,1,N/A,Recommended,"Extremely predatory in terms of monetization, with punishing matchmaking and solo play. It's like the worst trends of yesteryear's mobile loot games combined. A massive shop, hard to come by / randomly awarded currencies, level-locked high-rarity drops and so forth. Rewards for winning matches? Sure. But unless you pay with premium currency, you'll be waiting 3-8 hours for your pack with a few cards to actually be available for opening. And that is after you've manually clicked it to start the opening countdown - and you'll need to do this for each following pack, too. Heck, you cannot even have more than 4 packs in the opening queue at a time, so any further wins will only grant you kill points towards global twice? a day free packs... which you'll also have to login for or miss out on. Chances are, you'll already have the next such ""box"" earned by the time you've won your 4th match and thus booster, rendering further wins outside of ranked pointless. Ranked, meanwhile, only unlocks at player level 10. Getting there will be a slog, especially once you are currency-starved. The three daily missions reward you with some player exp, but the bulk of your leveling early on will be happening through upgrading cards by using duplicates.... which costs Gold as well as the duplicates you've painstakingly earned in the first place. At some point you'll be glad about getting a pittance of Gold coins from pack openings so you can at least buff your rares to stay relevant. The matchmaking - even in casual mode -  meanwhile, has no qualms about throwing a, say, level 6 player with a points limit of a little over 100 and low-statted cards into a battle against folks that run easily double the points, with more hitpoints on their leader, or sometimes even elites, than your entire 5-card deck combined - because of course, even your deck slots are level-gated, limiting viable deck builds especially for newer players who can neither field a few very strong, competitive units, nor a horde of middling ones. Let me be clear: This game was designed for mobile devices, with all that entails. I honestly thought this level of predatory monetization had long since fallen out of favor even on smartphones, but I guess I was mistaken. Considering that Combat Cards actually was a simple throwaway top trumps-like card set Games Workshop put out a few backs for a tenner, you'd be surprised just how much money these developers would like you to spend just to be able to actually play the damned thing for more than 20 minutes two or three times a day. But don't worry, they'll make sure to show you just how much better your experience could be if only you had higher-level cards (read: increasingly greater amounts of dupe-pulls and Gold), or any of the countless boxes and decks from the shop. The CPU battles may give you a few bonus levels on your cards when playing the mode, but don't worry - the difficulty will ramp up quickly, making sure the AI has both the numerical advantage as well as the qualitative. Gotta love those 200 HP elites with 100 point damage values smoking your entire board! There could be a really fun game here, but I'm afraid the monetization model and pseudo-competitive design, playing wallet vs wallet, really do their damndest to discourage any sort of dabbling. I'd go so far as to say that even if you were masochistically inclined, this is not an experience you'll be able to enjoy for much longer than the early tutorial-ish sections. Even as a hardcore fan of the franchise, with far too many models and novels decorating the apartment, and a desire for decent card game engagement, the game fails to keep me playing - both through its non-conducive reward mechanics as well as its haywire monetization.",2.3 hrs on record,N/A
76561198006906614,1,N/A,Recommended,"When The Past Was Around has been one of my most-anticipated titles over the past year. Ever since Mojiken published the game's prologue/demo for the first(?) Steam Game Festival, I've wanted to see, play, hear and learn more about it. When it finally released, I jumped at it, and beat it in one sitting. It's a short game, but one that delivers enough artistry and emotional impact to prove worth the price of admission. Every scene is well-crafted, stunningly drawn and heartfelt. The soundtrack perfectly accompanies the wordless narrative, be it through moments of intense grief, whimsical dates or hopeful melancholy. While I am certain that the game and what it offers will hardly be for everyone, I firmly believe that it presents a labor of love of a timeless quality that is well-worth experiencing for anyone with a taste for bittersweet stories, or struggling with the loss of a loved one. It may just help them starting to heal.",1.2 hrs on record,N/A

76561198006906614,2,N/A,Recommended,"While the atmosphere could well be darker and bleaker from the start, and the performance of Unreal Engine 4 is dreadful as you might expect, this Playable Teaser is actually rather promising. Mechanically, it's pretty much on point for what I'd want from a remake that takes cues from modern technology, including some innovations in the combat area by taking inspiration from the likes of For Honor and Kingdom Come: Deliverance; while the combat system itself feels a little clunky and slow right now, that's precisely the kind of thing that'd be best sped up for harder encounters down the line / when venturing out of the comfort zone(s). Design-wise, I quite like it, although again, desaturating the environment a tad and reducing bloom would go a long way towards calming people's chest areas. And while our protagonist is a chatterbox, especially in the intro, and some of the dialogue feels stilted and like it is pausing too much, the writing itself feels charming and engaging, especially when paired with well-done animations for NPCs.

My big point of criticism would be how fiddly a lot of the lineart can be. A lot of small objects to be found here are very tricky to pin down simply because you can't really tell what they are in the first place - or that their drawings are so simplistic, with few lines used, that their likeness could be found in many spots. It's fun, and worth playing through, but be aware that there's potential for frustration. Another bugbear would be that - once again - the DLC levels are right there on display, redirecting you to the store.

76561198006906614,2,N/A,Recommended,"Generally, the value of Slay the Spire is impressive. With a fourth character currently in Beta - at no charge - and plenty of well-balanced items and cards in the game, there's enough variety to keep things exciting without bloating the game like some other games tend to do (looking at you, Isaac!). Instead of adding too many cards to the pool, StS has just enough for each character to offer various viable builds, without having any obviously bad cards in the game. Situational ones do exist, and some won't synergize with your current run at all, but outright bad? Nope. As such, it is easy to appreciate the developers' work here. If you have any interest in card game adventures, figuring out how to best approach tricky fights with the cards you are dealt, then this game is clearly something you should consider. Even without any real desire to beat the game's rising difficulty Ascensions on each character, I find myself coming back to Slay the Spire even after 70 hours. It's quick, engaging and the daily mode alone offers a nice challenge on the regular. If, down the line, the developers decide to create a proper, full expansion to the game, with new environments, enemies, potentially mechanics or even alternative routes through the Spire, I'll be sure to open my wallet for it.",104.0 hrs on record																					(72.1 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198006906614,2,N/A,Recommended,"Having fallen in love with the original Guacamelee! to the point of beating it at least three times to 100% completion, including in the Super Turbo Championship Edition, I had high expectations for Guacamelee! 2. I was not disappointed. The gameplay is still as snappy as ever, despite additions and changes (most notably the way projectiles are(n't) affected by certain moves anymore), and the new abilities are great fun (if a bit fiddly in the case of the Eagle Shot - you'll get used to it before long, but it can feel a bit counterintuitive at first). Most excitingly, the Pollo Form is actually viable for a good deal of the game! Yes, turning into a chicken and bringing doom upon all things undead works better than ever, and the chicken-only traversal/combat skills open up a few interesting avenues for the game. Getting to visit a secretive underground illuminati society of chicken was also a cool and funny aspect. Thematically, Guacamelee! 2 follows up on what the first game did, while introducing the concept of the Mexiverse, rushing Juan through various timelines, with the Darkest Timeline being the primary stage of the game. The Chosen Juan has new enemies and bosses to face throughout, ranging from reminiscent of the original game to entirely fresh. Enemy variety has been expanded or changed, with a few of the more specific types from the first game only appearing briefly. New enemy behavior mechanics are introduced, some annoyingly mean enemies reprise their roles to make Juan's life harder (looking at you, explodey balls and undodgeable groundpounders!), mixing everything into a nice pot of chili that should keep you entertained and challenged in equal measure. There are some negative aspects to talk about - though whether you consider them truly noteworthy may depend on your own sense of humor. Guacamelee! has always been tongue in cheek to begin with, with many background elements like lucha-advertisements being filled with pop culture references and silly jokes throughout dialogue, but Guacamelee! 2 can be a bit more on the nose with this stuff. While hopping timelines, Juan ends up in various (indie) game inspired worlds, if only for brief moments; the first one that stood out to me was one based on Limbo, which felt super cool. Beating up a car in homage to Street Fighter was fun as well, but other worlds can be seen as a bit too meme-inspired - something that the game itself actually recognizes later on, throwing you into the Dankest Timeline and commenting on and citing fake(?) player reactions to the chosen comedy style. ""It'd be great if not for the memes"", for example. Whether you enjoy meme-culture and pop-references may have a larger impact on your enjoyment here than with the first game, at the very least. Though, thankfully, the general writing is still rather hilarious and imaginative. Additionally, I had the feeling that there were more instant death traps in this one, compared to the Super Turbo Championship Edition. While clearly delineated as such, they've made certain sections of dungeons and puzzle rooms in particular a bit more reliant on trial and error than I expected. They're no deal breaker, and usually follow on from checkpoints, but they can be a tad frustrating depending on your level of play. One other point I'm lamenting is that a part of the game is locked behind DLC, preventing 100% completion without buying the add-on. It's not that the price is egregious, but it did feel like a let-down to reach the Proving Grounds area in the game, having it clearly marked on the map, just to be told at the entrance by yet another Goat-Shaman that you'll have to pay your dues and open the storepage. The challenge rooms in Hell back in Guacamelee! 1 were some of the most challenging content in the game, and I'd expect the Proving Grounds to follow suit, but I wish they had implemented it in a different manner. Instead of teasing the player with the area, they should have locked it off seamlessly until the DLC was purchased, not let you enter a few steps and kick you out. In fact, the Proving Grounds DLC's existence is the reason I have yet to complete the game; I felt too miffed to buy it straight away, but am unwilling to beat the final boss/section before getting my hands on it. I'll pick it up at the next possible sale, but until then, I've had my fill and will remain patient - thankfully, Guacamelee! is like a friend you'll want to come back to revisit before long, and I'm sure I'll get another full playthrough out of it after all is said and done . Guacamelee! 2 proved to me that the concept, style and most importantly gameplay of the original game would still be exciting a few years later, and that the plot could be reasonably continued / spun off from to provide further installments. The writers at Drinkbox Studios also had enough fuel to go on, and the level design is once again a perfect blend of simplicity achieved through its polygonal platform style and imaginative by virtue of its backdrops and overall challenge difficulty. I am hugely satisfied by the game, and believe that fans of the original owe it to themselves to play the follow-up as well. Newcomers will probably still be better off starting with the STCE instead; while starting here wouldn't be a mistake, you'll better appreciate the additions and jokes after the first game. Though frankly, both are of an equally high quality grade to begin with, and you should feel right at home coming from one to the other.",16.2 hrs on record																					(13.0 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198006906614,2,N/A,Recommended,"Lara Croft Go is surprisingly thematic; Solving the various tombs feels reminiscent of the classic Tomb Raider adventures, if - necessarily - more limited in scope and gameplay than the classics. While not boasting many enemy types, for example (and I would certainly have liked seeing a bear in here!), they are made to be intuitive to navigate around while solving puzzles. Only the DLC let me down a tad here, as the missions present different environments that may easily have swapped more than an enemy's paintjob. However, none of this took away from the fun of the game; it just made me wonder what could have been improved or expanded on, had it been a PC title initially, rather than developed for touch devices. Speaking of touch, the controls take a bit of getting used to. Most of the time I was dragging my mouse in the movement directions, which was totally fine for me (though a gamepad may have been smoother), but moving pillars would still require clicking little arrows next to them (which, in at least two instances early on, I almost didn't notice), and in stressful puzzles, you may end up accidentally swiping the mouse to move Lara accordingly, just to realize you didn't take the pillar with you and will have to start over from the last checkpoint. It's a relic of the launch platform that may have been made more intuitive for PC use. For reference, the gamepad controls would have you hold Y / Triangle while moving in the desired direction. Generally, I was surprised by the lack of use for the right mouse button. Interacting with the environment may have made more sense using that, especially if it is just flipping a lever on your current space. However, as negative as it may sound, these were only small hurdles to adjust to initially, and thoughts on how a good game could have been made to feel more natural on the PC platform. I don't intend them to turn you off from giving the game a try, but to prepare you for the first few levels before you're used to them. Things work out relatively quickly. The puzzles themselves range from easy to rather challenging, with only a few real trial and error ones in here, which is cool to see. Moving a bunch of pillars in a confined space to shuffle them into the right order certainly took the longest for me, though I was able to do so without enemies in said puzzle room. Generally, your options are well-limited to not confuse you too much, with decoys being easily discernible if you stop to think - which the game allows you to do even with a boulder rolling towards you. To my surprise, I didn't feel less threatened by those boulders, lizards or the giant boss of the main game, just because I could stop and hold, as enemies and traps only react when Lara does. They still add a good deal of pressure to not screw up your next steps and think on your feet. The tools at your disposal are always clearly visible on the current screen, too. Honestly, I don't think there was a puzzle room in here that I was really frustrated by, even though some had me stuck a bit longer than others. The developers managed to put together an intuitive puzzler here, which I applaud. As a bonus, you can also collect various doodads throughout the levels, with each act granting a costume from the Tomb Raider series; whether you want the Angel of Darkness design or Wetsuit Lara, the game's got a wide range of low poly style player character models to unlock. It's a nice touch for fans of the wider franchise, if a bit finicky to find all those gempots sometimes. Thankfully, you can easily see and select missions you missed something at. Overall, I'm pleasantly surprised by Lara Croft Go, and can appreciate the wealth of positive coverage it has gotten since release. Yeah, I'd agree that this was one of the actually good mobile games at the time, and am happy to see it on PC as well. If you're into puzzle games, you should consider picking this one up.",6.2 hrs on record,N/A

It does rather well presenting the reader with a mystery, building up drama and then rushing straight to the lunatic conclusion, which offers more questions, some hints, and insane ""fun"", competently voice acted. The premise and execution certainly have me intrigued and I didn't have any trouble just breezing through it in one sitting, without getting distracted. The pacing generally works out well, especially seeing how this could be viewed as a prologue episode to the VN. Where it falls a tad short is with its characterizations of three of the four club members, only two plus one of which you are able to meet on a single playthrough, due to start-of-game-randomization. There simply isn't enough time to develop these three characters properly, especially since they prove little more than hangers-on in the group scenes, where the focus is firmly on the protagonist and Mio, the guaranteed character. With only a single choice in the novel, you'll only be able to elaborate a little more on one of the three secondary characters per playthrough, although save/load shenanigans are possible, as these choices do not appear to influence the story beyond the impressions the scenes will give the reader. On the flipside, I thought Mio was rather well-developed and I took a liking to her almost immediately. Her role in the novel going forward is going to be interesting to follow. In that sense, I felt it easy to relate to the protagonist's views. Generally, though, I wish that the other characters had been constructed a little more like Mio's role, at least in terms of building familiarity and depth of relationships, especially since the story flashes ahead and skips a few days at one point - time which could have been used to fill in exactly the kind of scenes that would have benefitted the cast. But then again, the brief nature of the story as a whole, with its relative lack of excess fat, mirrors the opening scene quite clearly. It strips the story of meandering scenes, skips chances for boredom, and reaches its twist with fanfares. I can applaud the author's intent here. Looking at the main menu / banner art, I am certainly hopeful for future episodes to realize more of DareSora's inherent potential. I'll be keeping my eyes and ears open for further releases. As it stands, with only this first, very brief episode, though, I can't say that I didn't get my money's worth out of it, or that I didn't feel satisfied by the way the story was delivered. While I certainly have questions and would be somewhat upset if they decided to not release any more than this, it'd have more to do with the story's potential being snuffed, rather than dissatisfaction with the first episode.

Apologies in advance if I offend anybody else's sensibilities by speaking my mind. When I saw the title pop up in the list of new releases, I was happy, expectant. A game titled ""Dark Elf"" surely had to be celebrating the glory of this dark-skinned, pointy-eared race of beautiful fantasy humanoids. It had to be elegant, maybe a bit haughty, but truly stunning to behold. At that point, I did not even care an ounce about the gameplay. Who really needs super-extravagant gameplay when there are Dark Elves to be had? Ever since Record of Lodoss War showcased the marvelous Pirotess, Dark Elves had a special spot in my heart. I even collected Warhammer Fantasy Battles' Dark Elves/Druchii, even though they were pale-skinned as their Ulthuanian High Elf cousins (which was not a surprise, considering how much of their land of exile is covered in snow). Chloe and Origa Discordia were heroes of their people before the Black Dog band came and ruined their lives. Sansei Muramasa from Full Metal Daemon even made it into Nitroplus Blasterz: Heroines Infinite Duel, which recently released on Steam. She showcases yet another example of Dark-Elvish grace. Yao Haa Dushi also showed the stoic might of her people in GATE: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri, and life was good at Alnus. I hope you can understand my excitement to a degree. These dark coffee-toned beauties are a sight to behold, and one easily appreciated. But then I saw this game, played it even, and my disappointment, nay, offense knew no bounds. This is no Dark Elf. Fraylia, or Frelia, whichever spelling in the game is actually supposed to be true, is no Dark Elf. I find the game's premise utterly deceptive. At best, she is a Toast Elf , who had a light tan from going to the solarium for a few hours. Maybe she even just used some tan-lotion (which might explain the light-spots on her skin?). Dark Elves Matter, dear developers. They are an already marginalized people who always stand in the shadows of their High Elven cousins in popular media. They are rarely considered to be included. Every piece of multimedia involving them is a rare gem, especially in western regions. This..... blatant whitewashing , is inexcusable. How could you do this? Why did you do this?

Playing it myself, I got even more impressed by the game's mechanics and variety. There's a lot of interaction between the cards that makes it work on a vastly different level from other card games out there. Even Gwent with its 2-3 rounds per match and different rows doesn't reach Age of Rivals' complexity. However, the game remains extremely simple and intuitive despite it all. Card texts are crystal clear and after the first two rounds you'll already have the hang of the basic rules and design intentions, if not the finer strategical details. Go big on cash generation, excessive culture output or just keep the opponent down with devastating attacker cards? There are many ways to win and enough flexibility to adapt on the fly, due to it being a deck builder game. Synergies have to be planned for in advance to succeed in the later rounds, which is oddly satisfying to pull off. It feels inviting while offering a lot of strategic considerations that could make this game successful on a competitive level.

76561198006906614,3,N/A,Recommended,"Planet of the Eyes attempts to replicate Limbo's success, but lacks the kind of atmosphere and challenge that made Limbo good. It has the simplicity and core puzzles, but beyond that, it is a very bland title. Playing it I never felt challenged by the platforming or puzzle design, only frustrated with its limitations. Towards the end, you'll encounter rotating arrangements of boxes to traverse. You have to carefully balance your little robot to not slide down on either side of a block, and figure out the right angle to jump off from. It is a matter of timing and precision, yet the controls feel noticeably unprecise in these sections. This is mostly down to when your robot will find it in himself to latch onto a ledge. The angle of a box has to be just right for it to happen, and even when you feel you should have been able to grab onto it, the automatic system might think otherwise. In reverse, you might end up sticking to ledges when you didn't mean to, and die as a result as well. That kind of design quirk makes me wonder why the devs couldn't have implemented, I don't know, a button press for hanging on to things? Its not like the game offers more than jump and interact buttons, plus a joke/achievement related dance button. Well, there is the pause menu too, but that, while it has a ""Resume"" button, doesn't actually pause the game. Oh joy. A lot of the puzzle-platforming could have been improved simply by requiring my user input, which a ledge-grab action would have helped with. There are a lot of spots where you have to jump from ledge to ledge, and the button-press timing necessary for that would have made them a lot more engaging. The way the game plays now, however, just had me bored . Beyond the clean and quirky art style, and the occassional audio log detailing the plot passively, I didn't feel like this was something enjoyable to play. The minimalist sound design adds to that as well. Compared to Limbo, which it is closest to, everything felt too basic, too simplistic and without real tension. There were a bunch of cool sections with alien wildlife making things difficult for you, but those mostly happened in the earlier parts of the game, and the closer you get to the end, the more it turns into pulling switches to avoid repetitive traps and waiting for platforms to move on their pre-described rotations or ferry you over lava lakes, while you're standing in place until reaching the jump-off point. It is an utterly inoffensive game, but sadly, that also means it has nothing really going for it to keep me playing.",4.9 hrs on record																					(1.4 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198006906614,3,N/A,Recommended,"UPDATE September 2016: The game's development is basically abandoned at this point. A recent Kickstarter update has the developer claim he ""lost all his code on launch day"" and then took a break to stop being depressed about it for months. Following on from that, he also takes a dump on people wanting refunds and calls people posting on the Steam forums ""fake Gamers"". The line ""Have fun, vandalize the forums, I do not give a ♥♥♥♥"" makes his attitude unmistakably clear. I'd also like to point out that, while FleetCOMM is a commercial product being sold on Steam and Kickstarted, to the developer it is nothing more than a hobby (""FleetCOMM is where I have fun"") and will only be worked on when he feels like it, if at all. Avoid this clusterfrak. --------------- It is utter garbage made by a megalomaniacal asshat. Just stay away for sanity's sake. Heck, even the menu design is terrible.

76561198006906614,3,N/A,Recommended,"Some first impressions from my first hour of playtime regarding the port and comparability to Hyperdimension Neptunia: First off, the game runs smooth even on my old toaster card. This is likely due to it being more CPU intensive to begin with, but even then I am seeing no hiccups with my i5-4460 and my HD5750, running Windows 10 Pro x64 - in other words, the game runs smoothly at 60fps (which is the default lock as per the .ini file, but may be unlockable). There are no in-game graphics options to speak of besides resolution and a fullscreen/windowed/borderless toggle, but then you'll hardly need more, seeing the game's artstyle and heavy reliance on animated 2D backgrounds and sprites. Further graphics settings may be available in the .ini file again, and AA can be forced via your graphics vendor's control panel regardless. Settings for controls, sound and so on are all there, including manual button remapping for your gamepad (which should help with getting non-standard Xinput pads to work), and Voice, Movie, Effects and BGM volumes have separate sliders, as they should have. From a gameplay standpoint, the game is close to Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth, which it supposedly shares the engine with. If you've played Neptunia, you'll find it easy to get into the systems, though even after an hour of playtime, there are differences and additions in Fairy Fencer F. Those differences include the Tension meter that raises/lowers your stats in combat and allows you to transform at a certain point (whereas Neptunia gave you more free reign with transformations), ""boosting"" weapon stats, learning new skills and what not through using them to earn and assign points, attaching Fairies to your characters for added perks, switching weapon styles to increase certain parameters like crit chance, speed and the likes, and Character Challenges which reward you with stat increases for various gameplay milestones. These challenges also encourage cycling through your party members, as some of them demand a character to be the party leader or do things only the leader is able to. It is a nifty system I'm looking forward to explore more in-depth, as it should keep things fresh (if a little grindy in the higher ranks, I expect). Overall, the gameplay system at least feels more complex in terms of customization and late-game options than Neptunia (though take my judgement with a grain of salt - I'm not that far in yet). The story and characters up to now seem like a good combination. The character dynamic between the protagonist and his fairy partner are funny and lighthearted, which reminds of Neptunia, but appears far more grounded and less preposterous than Nep did. If Gamindustri felt too wacky and over the top to you, Fairy Fencer F might deliver a more enjoyable experience. The basic plot is very simple in theory: Collect all the Fury weapons and revive the Goddess, explore dungeons, talk to people in towns (again, more grounded than in Neptunia, though very similar in execution), and fill your protagonist's stomach. The art design and music are straight-up gorgeous, as would be expected from the team behind them (which includes Nobuo Uematsu as composer and Yoshitaka Amano on the art, two big creatives that made Final Fantasy so good in its glory days). Fairy Fencer F offers some top-notch, high quality art in the typical J-RPG/Anime style.

76561198006906614,4,N/A,Recommended,"HuniePop is a game that I did not expect to actually enjoy. I considered it a gag game, something that people would buy to poke fun at friends, like they did with Bad Rats and Secret of the Magic Crystals over the years. While I still believe that HuniePop will be very successful at that, boy was I wrong about its entertainment value and competence as a game. The writing is spot-on and the humor stellar, poking fun in all the right places, and toying with dating sim and nerd stereotypes. The match-three gameplay is as you might come to expect from the genre, though rather than putting pressure on the player via timers, HuniePop limits the available turns. This turns a traditionally hectic, chaotic gameplay mechanic into something more calculated. Since the match-three game is played during virtual dates with the female characters, this actually makes sense. At an actual date, you wouldn't be rushing about, but instead take care not to step onto your date's toes, or act like a fool. The time-based pressure comes into the picture later on, when you are ready to take the girls home to your bedroom. And again, this decision works well once you consider what is actually happening behind the scenes. Playing this bedroom variation is exhausting, especially later down the line, as the difficulty increases with each successful date. However, where the game shines the brightest is when it presents its very diverse cast of heroines. There is a date for every taste. The characters' lifestyles can be like night and day, and you are bound to grow fond of a few of them. I know I did. Where it falls short, in my opinion, is in its directness. There really isn't much to do with the girls after you bed them. Yes, you can/should complete their gift lists (which takes a while) and unlock their complete stat sheets (which you will likely have finished by the time you get to the 4th date anyway), but there are no new events or CGs to earn past the first time with them in your bed. There is also no interaction between the girls, past the introduction scenes which overlap. This is my biggest criticism. The introductions were amazingly fun to watch, and I really want more of that. Seeing the amount of promo-art for the game, with the girls in various locations, playing volleyball or sitting in the sauna, I cannot help but regret the lack of story-events. Just playing through the game and talking to the girls gave me plenty of ideas of what events I would like to see them in. I hope this will be expanded on in the future, maybe via DLC.

76561198006906614,4,N/A,Recommended,"The PC Port is atrocious as of now. Not only did they not bother making localization files optional downloads (Steam supports selective downloading of localization files), and have you thus install 60 gigabytes (49gb download) onto your machine, but they also failed to provide any sort of graphical options beyond Windowed/Fullscreen modes. No VSync, no Anti-Aliasing. Additionally, the game's internal renderer is locked to 720p, and the game won't output anything but 720p. Fullscreen on an 1080p screen will thus either stretch/scale accordingly, or add black bars. They have also failed to add audio options. There are no volume sliders at all. On the Gameplay front, there's enough been said already. The game is excruciatingly linear, and chock-full of cutscenes. For comparison: If you played Final Fantasy X and considered it too linear due to the lack of global world map and directly connected areas, you'll hate XIII. It takes a good 15-20 hours of corridor walking to reach the point where it opens up a little bit. There is little to nothing to distract you from narrow corridors. The combat system is shoving the Auto-Battle command down your throat right from the start. The command selects attacks and abilities based on dynamically calculated algorithms. Especially early on, where the characters are limited to one job, with one or two commands(!), the game turns into a simple ""Press A to do stuff"" simulator. The tactical element from previous Final Fantasy titles is almost completely lost as a result, as the game almost turns the player into a passive observer. On top of this, the game attempts to ""rate"" the player's combat performance from 1 to 5 stars, based on how long it took them to win a battle. The rating affects the item drops, but even then a 5 star rating will not guarantee even common drops. I'd also like to point out that the target time, especially early on, is very generous, almost giving double the time you actually need to finish a battle with a 5 star rating. Lastly, battles are completely isolated from one another. Where in previous FF titles you had to watch your HP carefully, and would take damage and negative status effects into the following battles, XIII instead heals the party to full health after a win. Wave-based engagements like seen in Final Fantasy X (most notably the tutorial section teaching you to pick targets wisely, or the Bevelle Marriage scene) do not stress you beyond the current, very short battle. As for the story I will just say it is very, very convoluted and throws technobabble at the player for lack of better writing. The characters contradict each other and themselves at every turn, and make you shake your head in disbelief. At least the Japanese Audio will make their voices bearable, though. Be prepared to read up on a lot of the game's terminology and background via the in-game Datalog to fully grasp the game's reasoning. Still, do not expect things to make complete sense. Graphically, it still looks quite nice, with pretty effects being thrown around. The vast amount of pre-rendered cutscenes (18, if I count the game's video files) look gorgeous, even if the contents aren't making for a good story. If you enjoy eyecandy, you will get it, even though the resolution lock and lack of options are a big failure on Square Enix's part. Overall, the pricetag reflects the game's quality. The mechanics and exploration are half-baked and too automated and controlled to satisfy an old franchise fan like me. The port is dreadful, and I would not recommend buying it until they at least offer a patch to add some basic settings for graphics and audio. If you can't wait, though, please don't expect it to be up there with the franchise's gems and fan-favorites.

76561198006906614,4,N/A,Recommended,"Having just finished the tutorial sections and story exposition parts of the first hour, I cannot speak for the whole game, but I felt it necessary to present my views after browsing the mostly negative Steam reviews on this game. Yes, Deus Ex: The Fall is a mobile port. As such, it suffers from simplified gameplay, controls and mechanics, as well as voice acting and animations that cannot live up to the standards of the high-budget release that Human Revolution was. However, it is definitely not as bad as people make it out to be. I can understand their disappointment, but this was never going to be a fully overhauled experience, but a port of the mobile version - and as such, it works. Firstly, the game runs smoothly, and while the graphics options are limited to resolution, fullscreen/windowed mode and various degrees of Anti-Aliasing, lacking a Field of View setting, it does not look awful. Yes, you will recognize it for being a port, but it looks well enough. What it struggles with are animations - especially during the many early cutscenes and dialogues. Characters look rather static, almost more so than in the original Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Gestures are rare, and overall the lack of life in the character models underlines the, in my opinion, biggest issue with the game: The mediocre voice acting. Deus Ex: HR, outside of the main cast, ranged from acceptable to poor voice acting, but in The Fall, even the main characters have taken an obvious hit. Their lines are often delivered mechanically, or overdone, and don't match up with poses or expressions. What might not seem like a big issue on a smaller mobile screen quickly becomes disappointing on the bigger PC monitor and a proper sound system. During the first few areas, you will find a bunch of audiologs, which are actually reasonably well done, however. This makes it especially odd that the story-dialogue between Ben Saxon, Jaron Namir, Anna Kelso and co feels flat. Most sound effects I came across are directly copied from Human Revolution, so they are of reasonable quality. I have read about certain issues with sound effects or voices cutting out for some users, but have not experienced anything of the sort on my machine so far. As for the music, I liked what I listened to up until now, with common themes from HR mixed with new tracks I might even prefer over the bigger title's soundtrack. Now for the Gameplay; It suffers from its touchscreen origins, and there is nothing to be said otherwise. There is no jumping in the game, only contextual vaulting. No merry hopping around in The Fall. However, you get used to it easily, and the rest of the mechanics are fairly similar, if not the same, as in Human Revolution. There have been a few changes to the interface, though, which may need some getting used to. The augmentations are pretty much the same as in the other game, as you might expect. I think Praxis Point requirements have been adjusted slightly, and the trees trimmed. The dialogue system is still in, including the analyzer-augment - which I didn't get to use just yet, since all conversations so far were linear. Again, this is about an hour in, past the prologue sections. The biggest change to the game would be the inventory / market. You can buy weapons, ammo, items, etc from wherever you are, provided you have the funds. This means you can stock up on cash, and then just pick and choose gear for the situation you are currently facing - got no EMP grenades to disable a robot? Spend 200 credits and you're ready to throw! Personally, I think the idea is alright, but I would have liked to see limits to this system, or at least have it be more expensive than merchants found in the game. For all its simplifications in the gameplay department, however, the world still feels like Deus Ex. The environment design seems quite alright, despite middle of the road textures for props. The atmosphere of HR is captured nicely, and ebooks, datalogs and emails are still all there, adding more lore to locations, characters and technology. The game does follow up on the Deus Ex: Icarus Effect novel, but does a good enough job introducing non-readers to the characters and their motivations - though for obvious reasons, reading the novel first is recommended. Please also be aware that The Fall was released as part one of the story, but so far, there hasn't been any word on a continuation. As far as I heard, the ending might disappoint due to a cliffhanger. Considering Square Enix/Eidos's plans for the franchise, though, this should get addressed fairly soon, with a new PC game in the works already, and James Swallow writing more stories based in the universe. It should also encourage that a screen accessible from the main menu also made it from Mobile to PC, proclaiming that a continuation is supposedly happening, and the Pacifist achievement refers to the game as ""Part 1"". I am hopeful for a continuation. Should you expect a big blockbuster like Human Revolution? No, not at all. This neither had the budget nor the time to become as impressive. For what it is, however, it is a fine Spin-off to the franchise, which fans should appreciate, once they lower their expectations and demands to a reasonable level, in accordance to the game's price and scope. It is a slice of Human Revolution, for a fifth of the launch price of said tripe A release. Considering that, I can't be too mad at the game.",2.8 hrs on record,N/A
76561198006906614,4,N/A,Recommended,"I just played my first 40 or so minutes and reached the Ash Desert, which is the 3rd world after the intro section. My god is it a wonderful game! To put it in perspective: I usually, for almost every single game, play in windowed mode. So I actually went to the options menu, set the game to windowed, and started playing. Even before leaving the Void, I had already switched back to 1080p fullscreen and got rid of all external distractions to best take in the beautiful art direction, soundtrack and voice. The setting, while rather depressing in many ways, actually also feels quite uplifting - and I can appreciate that. That the gameplay is very intuitive and enjoyable only supports my belief that I've got a real gem on my hard drive right now. Thanks to the developers for Nihilumbra. How in all the hells could a game like this have been stuck in Greenlight-limbo for over a year?! Valve really need to get their act together.... I will update this ""review"" later on, when I have played (a lot) more of it. However, I doubt this game can anything but better from there on out. It is a lovely game, and I would very much recommend picking it up!",3.9 hrs on record																					(0.7 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198006906614,4,N/A,Recommended,"I first finished this game around May or June 2013 after I got it from a Greenlight bundle. I loved it for the art direction, the simple mechanics that induced nostalgia in me, and the comfortable gamepad controls (I would not play a game like this with mouse and keyboard, out of personal preference). Having grown up during the old age of ""jump & run"" games, or platformers, I felt right at home with Oozi. It pulled all the right strings for me, and made me remember my old Sega days with all those simple yet enjoyable games. Oozi has 24 levels in its story mode (whereas the story is just a basic framing on loading screens and between the four zones), of which 4 are boss fights. That may not seem much compared to games like Super Meat Boy or A Walk in the Dark, but it certainly is enough in this case. Levels can last a good amount of time, depending on difficulty and skill level. You'll definitely get many more hours out of the game than out of pretty much any modern shooter. On top of the main levels, however, the game also comes with an Arcade Mode, which puts you back into those levels with a more specific goal than reaching the end: Collect as many stars as you can before the timer runs out. If you die, start from the beginning. Checkpoints replenish a bit of time, which is very tight all the way through the level. If you finish the level, you will get a rating from one to three stars, depending on the amount of stars you caught. This is quite tricky in a lot of levels, and will require almost perfect runs to get 3 stars. There are also Challenge and Bonus missions, with varying goals. From reaching the end of the level while avoiding rising water to ""kill all enemies"" missions, you'll get a lot of action. Additionally, those, too, have two additional goals each. All three goals need to be met for a three star rating. And they run on a timer! These missions are tough as nails, and will probably infuriate you a lot. However, they are satisfying to beat, and well-designed - if you are good at platformers, test yourself on them! The overall level design of Oozi is simple on first glance, without any elaborately hidden secrets (not unless you run through levels blindly), but the trap and enemy placement really builds a nice difficulty curve. While you start out with only your basic double-jump and can only knock out basic enemies, every zone delivers a new set of skills and mechanics. This ranges from stomping over wall-jumping to picking up bombs, punching stunned enemies and hiding in shadows. The traps get more mean as the game progresses, and while a lot of them and the enemies are similar or just visually different from previous encounters, the sheer variety of things that may kill you is a plus. Truth be told, the game still has some glitches and bugs here and there (restarting one challenge mission would get the objective stuck, for example), but nothing that would really deter from the game's enjoyment. Those things are easily fixed and worked around. As it stands I would recommend Oozi: Earth Adventure to fans of platformers, and oldschool platformers specifically. It is a refreshingly enjoyable game without any of the more ""pretentious"" elements or big stories, and simply focuses on challenging the player. Which it does excellently!

76561198006906614,4,N/A,Recommended,"A pure adaption of the boardgame classic, Space Hulk comes with all you may be used to playing with on the tabletop, with none of the setup troubles, boxing the tiles and pieces after a long and tense session. It comes with an online multiplayer mode, which allows you to take the missions to the internet and test your wit against friends too far away to come over to sit around the table with you! Full Control Studios are, without a doubt, fans of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, and Space Hulk in particular. Despite the bumpy launch the game had, their dedication to the project shows. Space Hulk is a turn-based strategy game involving two factions - the Space Marine Terminators and the alien Genestealers. Both sides play vastly differently - from the amount of actions a unit can take per turn, to how it achieves its goals. The Terminators are slow, hulking figures who rely on ranged weaponry, area denial and re-rolls to fight the Xenos, while the Genestealers are numerous, fast and require to close the distance to attack a Marine with their diamond-claws. They can easily outmaneuver the opponent, and receive reinforcements every turn. To make things worse, the number of dice a normal Marine rolls against the 'stealers, is limited to one, against the aliens' three, and the highest result wins the combat - and kills the enemy. There are no life points in this game - if a character gets wounded, he is considered dead for the rest of the game. To balance this out, the Space Marine player receives 1 to 6 Command Points per turn, determined by (virtual) dice. Those can be used to enact additional actions beyond the 4 allowed action points of a Terminator. Even though limited and unreliable, these points, if used well, will offer a lot of tactical flexibility to the player. The inherent strength of the Terminators lies in their weaponry - their Storm Bolters are deadly and their close combat specialists allow them to deny the Genestealers the highest of their rolls or to re-roll one of their own. The flamer can bathe a whole room or section in fire, easily burning the aliens to ashes if stepped in, denying whole parts of the map. However, its use is limited to 6 shots per mission! The assault cannon is equally limited to 20 shots, and acts like a much stronger Storm Bolter. Overwatch, costing 2 action points, will ensure that your Marines will also shoot on any enemy that crosses into line of sight, or moves within it, giving you an advantage over the enemy's fast tactics. The objectives are determined by the mission. They may range from simple kill count goals to evacuating a certain amount of squad members. All the main missions are adapted from the boardgame. Yes, Space Hulk had its share of problems at launch, and probably still has some of them, but more than a few can be attributed to just how close this video game adaption is to the boardgame it was meant to represent. Bugs and performance issues have been significantly reduced by now, the game runs smooth, and a new, albeit short, campaign has been added to the game for free. A criticism that was brought up a lot at launch was the ""sluggish"" movement of the player's Terminators. While personally I very much enjoyed the hulking Space Marines move through the corridors like that, I can understand that not everybody has the same attention span and some may like to move on more quickly (although, once an order is issued, you can move ahead and issue another to the next Terminator of your choosing - they will enact them simultaneously). Since then the developers have introduced a new setting to the options menu, allowing the player to toggle the animation speed, resulting in a good boost in unit movements. Another criticism leveled was the lack of satisfying squad customization - one I can understand, but not feel quite as strongly about. The characters in the game are directly inspired by the 3rd edition boardgame set, released in 2009, which I own. Having invested a lot of time in painting the miniatures of Sergeants Gideon and Lorenzo, Brothers Claudio, Zael, Omnio and all the rest, I can attest that the ingame models are very much like those little plastic figures. They are so faithfully modeled, I felt a bit sad that the boardgame miniatures are stuck with static (though dynamic) poses. Customizing a squad's loadout also would not work with the way the missions are written. The game presents you with a short mission context and your objectives, all presented via Terminator-like voice acting (though not of the high standard of Relic's Dawn of War II games, it is still suitably grim), a neatly animated map and iconography. What new players may not realize, however, is that the missions, have been written with certain restrictions and loadouts in mind. There are no differences between individual Terminators apart from their equipment - changing any one of the Power Fist + Storm Bolter Terminators to another Flamer, an Assault Cannon or close combat gear would undoubtedly unbalance the missions and remove a big part of the challenge. Space Hulk is a challenging game. Some people, myself included, would even go as far as to call it a strategic puzzle game. Knowing your pieces is vital to success, being aware of all entry points of the enemy's Genestealers is crucial. A wrong move can easily unravel your whole deployment, and turn your structured progress into a desperate run for the exit. The randomness of the dice adds a layer of unpredictability, but similar to Blood Bowl, minimizing the risks of the dice and thinking your moves through is the key to success. A dice roll may turn sour, but there are certain contingencies to make up for the randomness, if the player is smart enough to use them. In addition, the game itself takes care of all the manual tasks and notetaking of the tabletop version, keeping you informed of your resources at all times. The learning curve may be a bit steep for some players, I admit, but unlike the boardgame, the video game adaption offers three short tutorial missions, which should do a lot of good in making you aware of the key strokes of the game. Thankfully for new players, the 2 minute timer the Terminator player is subject to in the boardgame (unless the players decide not to use it to add even more pressure to the Space Marine's shoulders) is turned off by default and not enforced in singleplayer games. Purists can still play the game on hard difficulty and use the timer, but I am glad they made this optional. The level editor is still in the making, I'm afraid. If the current 18 missions (three tutorial missions, 12 for the classic Sin of Damnation Campaign and the 3 new missions on board of the Messenger of Purgatory) aren't enough to sate your appetite (which is unlikely, as missions are very replayable and usually not beaten on your first try), there are two new DLC Campaigns available right now (Sword of Halcyon and Defilement of Honour), both of which feature a set 5 missions each and are directly inspired from old first and second edition rules of the boardgame. Squad customization may or may not be added in the future, but first I assume there will be the teased and promised Chapter Packs, introducing more than just the Blood Angels to the game - all neatly modeled according to lore and current miniature kits. Full Control have also said that they would include those Chapter Packs with new, Chapter-unique (historical) campaigns and flavor. This is DLC I can get behind and will support. Considering that the first priority for Full Control was using the license to recreate the 3rd edition box set of Space Hulk, which was only produced in very limited quantities back then to begin with, I can acknowledge that they did an incredible job at capturing the game's aesthetic, tone, sound and, obviously, the rules. This is, without a doubt, Space Hulk. For the Emperor!",12.1 hrs on record																					(6.6 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198006906614,4,N/A,Recommended,"To be frank, my expectations for TR were low before launch. I was not thrilled by the redesign, and the drama about implied rape scenes (which turned out to be completely fabricated for the sake of causing even more drama) or the vulnerability of female characters in gaming certainly did not make me feel hopeful about the game. The bigger focus on third person shooting without acrobatics seemed like a turn-off as well. It took a friend to invite me to a 3 hour session of watching a walkthrough on Youtube to get me to buy the game, a few days past launch. What I saw in the videos was gritty, characterful and, while still heavy on the shooting, actually fun to play. Initial skepticisms aside, what I got out of Tomb Raider was more than I had hoped for. The graphics were gorgeous, and the game ran incredibly smooth even on my old (but trusty) HD5750 - which surprised me greatly. Of course, I still wouldn't recommend enabling the TressFX feature for more realisticly calculated hair physics - the performance hit won't be worth it to most people. The aesthetics were stunning, to say the least. From shores right onto mountain tops, abandoned bunkers or extensive cave networks and old asian villages, the art direction of this game impressed me. While you may think that lost islands aren't exactly the most original setting for a game, the way the wartime relics, bunkers, nature and old asian environments flowed together was satisfying to take in. The sound design was solid, although there may be a bit too much focus on having Lara express her pain or the effort she's making jumping and climbing. Of course those grunts and moans make sense in relation to the story, but at times they got too much for my taste. Guns sounded good, explosions had a nice WHOOM! effect and the Soundtrack is simply fantastic and sets the right mood for the game. Gameplay-wise, the game played really smoothly, and Lara's set of animations let every player action flow neatly into the next. Like I said before, there is a bigger shooting element in the game, but thankfully you can avoid a lot of the encounters by employing stealth (which is not an active mode, but works rather naturally anyway) to take out enemies without alerting the cavalry. Kills grant experience, but if I remember it correctly, the stealth kills grant a comparable amount. The guns felt good to use, and some of them had more uses than gunning down crazy people and were used in puzzles or exploration, like the bow's rope-darts. The upgrades were visually represented, and while they may make it appear like Lara's the daughter of MacGyver, having a fully upgraded weapon, like the bow, felt satisfying and well-worth the scavenging for parts. Speaking of scavenging: The game has A LOT of that. Breaking boxes, looting animals, finding trinkets, artifacts and doing little mini-challenges in certain areas - the game keeps you busy. Some of it will of course feel rather game-y and may be perceived as padding, but it still feels good to find that last hidden skull charm hanging from a tree... I completed all of those challenges on my first playthrough, which I ended at the 20 hour mark. The game would have allowed me to go back and finish all those leftovers - but I had none. However, the artifacts come with a nice little feature: You can view them in detail, rotate them around, zoom in, and maybe find some further detail. All of this while Lara comments on the object, determines its origin or shares a little story. While picking those objects up might not seem practical in her situation, this feature really lent depth to Lara the archeologist. The woman knows what she's doing! Sadly there is no singleplayer DLC that would add more tombs or areas, outside of the preorder DLC ""Tomb of the Lost Adventurer"", which was neat, but short - like all tombs in the game. This may be my biggest criticism of the game. The tombs are fairly lackluster. They all basically consist of ONE room, and one central puzzle. Gone are the lengthy puzzles with a lot of backtracking, that would feel very satisfying once you'd figure everything out. Instead you get a short, simple puzzle, often with timed jumping involved, and a treasure chest sequence as a reward. I was hoping for more in that department, as the Tomb aspect is a vital part of the TOMB Raider franchise, in my eyes. The leveldesign switched from fairly linear corridors to more open areas quite a lot, depending on the situation Lara was in at the time, and where her path lead her. I liked the mix, and enjoyed being able to return to an earlier camp and put my new tools to use and pick up the missing treasures. Sadly, I cannot say much about the keyboard controls, as for this I felt a gamepad to be the most sensible choice. For what its worth, I would definitely recommend using a controller, as the smoothness of movements will get much clearer with those pretty analog sticks. The gamepad layout worked very well for me, and running around on Yamatai quickly felt natural to my fingers. I will not go into the story, for obvious reasons. However, I enjoyed it for what it was, even if it was quite predictable at times, and threw Lara into more and more awkward situations by the hour. Just so much: Be aware that TR has always had a supernatural element, and is not restricted by science or history. Back in the days you could get killed by dinosaurs, which isn't the case here, but you won't get around some ritual magic and otherwise ;) And yes, this is an origin story - Lara starts out as a rookie who has to go through a lot throughout the game. She does grow as a character, however, and while the mass-shootings are rather drastic and exist more because you are playing a game with guns, rather than because the game needed them, I don't see them as contradictory to the main character's development. The other characters are a bit bland at first glance, but receive more development via flashbacks in the form of camera recordings or diary entries and letters, which are another of the multiple collectible types in the game. Those letters add a whole new layer to the narrative, and connect the whole crew. Some of them legitimately saddened me. Apart from this, there's this one guy you'll want to punch very hard in the manhood, and the father figure Lara has to eventually outgrow in a sense. Their inclusion achieves what it is supposed to, and serve to add conflict and reassurance to the whole ordeal. Now, there's one more thing: The multiplayer. I did not spend more than one session with that component, as I am not interested in 99% of multiplayer games - simply not my cup of tea. I did, however, find the map I played on to have more depth than anticipated, and could imagine the mode to be a good amount of fun, if you can get a full session going. However, no promises there, I did not play much of it. Despite all the drama surrounding Lara Croft's redesign and the series reboot, Tomb Raider has managed to win me over quite assuredly. The game does not get as much credit as it deserves, and I would definitely recommend picking it up if you enjoy a good action adventure game.",23.6 hrs on record																					(23.5 hrs at review time),N/A
