L.A. Noire,"Adventure, Strategy",I like to push npcs into cars so they die
L.A. Noire,"Adventure, Strategy",damn solving a case is very satisfying
L.A. Noire,"Adventure, Strategy",Play it like detective TV series. 1 case per day.
L.A. Noire,"Adventure, Strategy","some cases are really easy af but some cases are harder than beating the final boss of all dark souls series lol But regarding of all those things, This game is generally a great work. You have so much potential about various mechanics  that you can't even think about in it."
L.A. Noire,"Adventure, Strategy","Playing as the police, the other side of the GTA coin, having to deal with the mess that you maniacs left behind. You know what you did... I've been drooling over all the Rockstar games on Steam, and every time I look at the comment section, see people complaining about the Social Club feature. This has completely put me off all of their titles, as someone with limited internet access, and a disdain for filling in forms, I mainly play offline. I bought this a while ago on sale and got this game downloaded on my crawling internet, so this was a good test I thought, to see if their games can function offline. I started up L.A. Noire, and it asked me to create a Social Club account, and on the right hand side of that menu, in smaller print, to create a local profile. I went with that option, to create a local profile and it asked me to type a name, and that was it. I could play offline, no need for Social Club. And could play it completely offline any other day. Test passed, on to the game itself. This game features heavily on the character interactions and communication, the likes I have not experienced before. I've never been one to care for things like lip synch techniques, and in-case someone wants to see a good case study of how it should be done, this is it. Not only lip synchronization, but facial features with animations as well for that matter are very life-like, even though the models are slightly dated. The character narratives are not only shown in a cut-scene style, but also while you are investigating, giving your actions and the npcs reactions a lifelike give and take. And speaking of the facial animations, in other games it's done purely for technical achievement, or art for style points. Here it's literally a feature, you have to read the persons' body language that you are interrogating by looking at their behaviour, and their facial expressions. They really are life-like and you can see their personality in those sometimes very subtle facial animations alone. It's remarkable. The world is flat. Some claim that the world is round. This one definitely is not. We're probably used to a lot better open world city type scenery by now, but this has a lot of small attention to details, and the world is densely created with professional art while it does have a overall, what I would call a clinical cleanliness feel to it. Or best described as the look of a simulator of sorts, instead of trying to beautify everything. It's running good in 4k on my humble PC, and it's all a very pleasant experience. Plenty of old fashioned cars beautifully created, and plays responsive enough to enjoy driving places. While the world itself is a bit lacking in colour, they are not afraid to use colourful language and red pixels when the bullets starts flying. For being on the right side of the law they give you plenty of slack to not restrict your fun in playing and throw enough bad guys with a death wish at you to balance the detective work with action. It's a neat game."
L.A. Noire,"Adventure, Strategy",HIGS REPRESENT
L.A. Noire,"Adventure, Strategy","Long time ago, PC gamers killed the Mother of Rockstar's CEO. Since then that CEO torturing PC gamers with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ports, crappy framerates and dumbass DRM"
L.A. Noire,"Adventure, Strategy",Very good game 12/10
L.A. Noire,"Adventure, Strategy","The movie L.A Confidential, except it's a game. Best played in Black and White for maximum atmosphere. Rockstar again showing they are the only western dev who can deliver a truly gritty crime game. L.A Noire absolutely smashed Mafia 2 back in 2011 as the best Noir game that year. Great game, average port. Really bad draw distance and pop in. Shadows look rough even on highest settings. Controller supported but non re-bindable. It does seem to run well, although sometimes hard crashes when you quit the game. It's an action adventure that's light on the action part, heavy on the adventure. Most of the shootouts and gunplay occur in side missions. This isn't GTA in the 40s. The world is only semi open and you can't pull your gun out when not in a fight. That being said, the shooting and driving feel like a more refined GTA IV. It's the kind of game David Cage would make if he made actual games that had real gameplay. Most of the game is based around collecting clues and dialogue options. If you don't like that kind of game, you won't like this. Follow 1940's Police Officer Cole Phelps as he rises through the ranks of the LAPD. First as a patrolman, then as a detective. Progress through four detective desks: Traffic, Homicide, Vice and finally Arson. Bring down perverted movie producers, find the truth behind the Black Dahlia Murderer and uncover a sinister conspiracy involving returned servicemen, real estate developers, the Kosher Mob, pop-psychologists and even the LAPD."
L.A. Noire,"Adventure, Strategy","amazing game, it's a nice change to be on the police side for once after all the mayhem we caused in years of gaming :D after finishing the game I can also say that this was one of the best, longest and storywise most interesting games I've ever played, I think it filled the void left after Mafia. I genuinely felt sad to finish the game"
DARK SOULS™ II: Scholar of the First Sin,"Action, RPG",gank city
DARK SOULS™ II: Scholar of the First Sin,"Action, RPG","Ah, finally killed the first boss."
DARK SOULS™ II: Scholar of the First Sin,"Action, RPG",best souls 2
DARK SOULS™ II: Scholar of the First Sin,"Action, RPG","Ok let me be honest, Dark souls 2 is not a bad game but at the same time it is not as good as I thought. Reason being the fact that before playing this game I've played Dark souls, which was a masterpiece(a complete package), like I still remeber that I wasn't able to forget about dark souls 1 for a week after I'd completed that game. Like seriously the day I ended that game I was completely empty, it was like I wanted more, I wanted to know more about the lore, the areas, the story behind all those characters, how did we end up in such a place and what not. I literally remember spending hours on research. And that was the best part about dark souls. Now when I played this game and completed it, I was like is this even a dark souls?! Like the story is not memorable, characters aren't intresting and the boss fights!! oh god, why were all those bosses so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ easy?!! literally it just took me 30hrs (excluding the dlc's) to complete this game, and when you compare that to dark souls 1....dude I literally spent 100hrs on that game the boss battles in 1st game are actual hard and meorable and that's what makes dark souls what we know it for. Hard boss battles, finding joy through frustration and struggle and finding our way through the game. And all that is literally missing in this game, bosses are easy, you already know what you have to do in the game, you know where you have to travel....like it dosen't give players a chance to figure things out for themselves and the good part is that yeah compared to it's predecessor this game has improved on the gameplay, as dark sousls 1 was pretty slow placed game. And the last thing to hate is it's porting like the  Scholar of the First Sin version atleast should have had a better port!....They did the same with dark souls prepare to die edition (though it has been fixed in the remastered edition) and now dark souls 2, though it's not a major issue if you get used to the controls but yeah players who are new to the series.....it's often frustrating. My final verdict, the game is not bad but when you play a masterpiece like the dark souls 1 and then hop onto dark souls 2 for the same experience you are just disappointed."
DARK SOULS™ II: Scholar of the First Sin,"Action, RPG","Not bad to 100%, could be better."
DARK SOULS™ II: Scholar of the First Sin,"Action, RPG",the best dark souls ever and you cant ever say otherwise >but muh wierdly placed trees near the cardinal tower shut up
DARK SOULS™ II: Scholar of the First Sin,"Action, RPG",The DLC is some of the best Dark Souls you'll find in the whole series. It is harder than the first game.
DARK SOULS™ II: Scholar of the First Sin,"Action, RPG",a bit different but still very good
DARK SOULS™ II: Scholar of the First Sin,"Action, RPG",Very Good.
DARK SOULS™ II: Scholar of the First Sin,"Action, RPG",nice
The Tiny Bang Story,"Adventure, Casual, Indie",This has a completely unplayable puzzle for color blind people. But besides that it's too short and has too little substance in both the puzzles and the plot.
"Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Relics of War",Strategy,"A clever take on the Warhammer 40K universe, almost as if one were to make a Civ-lite based in the WH 40K universe with each of the infamous factions having their own totally unique buildings, units, and style of play."
"Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Relics of War",Strategy,"I paid $3.99 for this. That is about what is worth after looking at the DLC....all of those factions should be in the game at BASE LAUNCH you lazy ♥♥♥♥♥. Couple hours into a custom game - turn 70, it crashes every time I try to end turn. Wtf is that ♥♥♥♥ in 2024? The game lacks replay-ability and any personality. It doesn't feel like a warhammer game, it just feels like a game using warhammer skins."
"Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Relics of War",Strategy,"Its quite hard but enjoyable nonetheless. Buy it while its discounted. Doesnt pretend to have diplomacy like CIV series, you are here to fight and there wont be any discussions or peaceful victories."
"Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Relics of War",Strategy,Very good game.
Hard West,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy","Goofy as all get out, probably offensive to many.  So I cannot recommend it. And yet, it really is a good tactical game, and there are a lot of cool story ideas in there."
Hard West,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy","Very interesting game: nice graphic and excellent atmosphere and story... However their customer assistance is the incredibly good: I had a problem of frequent crashes to desktop that made the game unplayable. I contacted the customer service without any hope but instead they answered very quickly and very politely, reading my email and framing immediately the problem: they answered me to insert a couple of lines in a .conf file in /etc (I am on linux) and... it worked! And apparently this trick solved another problem of crash to desktop in another game: the old “Empire: Total War”!"
Hard West,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",Real deal
Fallout 4,RPG,"I really hate this Fallout.. Conversations seem artificial, story is really uninteresting, lore changed from previous games adding the need for fusion cores so you can use power armour. This is my least favourite addition but easily fixed it by using a mod. You can't get achievements with mods enabled, this can be fixed using another mod. The dialogue interface is really, really bad. There isn't a singular character that I give a f**k about. I have zero motives in this game and the entire thing just seems so uninspired. Even VAT's have been ruined in this game. The gun play sucks and ammo is hard to find. I'll probably eventually finish this game only because I love the Fallout series but seriously even Fallout 76 is (unironically) more enjoyable. Edit: The game play and exploration is the only enjoyable thing, some aspects of it I love but most of it I loathe. Also every single achievement is hidden, how tf are you meant to 100% this game without knowing how to complete the achievements????"
Fallout 4,RPG,"is Fallout 4 a good game? Yes is Fallout 4 a good Fallout game? eh no, maybe decent at best Fallout 4 is fun with its gameplay and ideas but it lacks depth especially in world building. also as usual use mods if you want to play bethesda games because it doesnt just works"
Fallout 4,RPG,"Dont buy, Crashes far to much"
Fallout 4,RPG,"It’s been years since we last stepped foot in the apocalyptic wasteland, and while there certainly is a sense a familiarity in Bethesda’s latest entry in the Fallout franchise, it can’t help but feel like the start of a new era of Fallout. Fans and newcomers alike have plenty to enjoy in this massive game, and it’s there’s plenty game to go around. The only thing that might stop you from enjoying Fallout 4 over the previous entries is how married you are to it’s previous gameplay mechanics. Fallout 4 brings about a new focus in storytelling with the introduction of a voiced protagonist. Accompanying this is a more personal, stronger main story, as well as a tighter focus on who your character can be. In previous Fallout games, you could be a bumbling idiot, or an evil overlord bent on destruction of everything, this is a bit toned down in F4, the new dialogue system always limits you to just 4 choices, and the ability to have certain dialogue depending on your character’s stats is mostly drawn back with the exception of charisma checks. The absence of skills in favor of a more streamlined leveling system means that your character isn’t going to pick up a gun and not be able to use it, or perform terribly with it. Your character is a concerned parent seeking their son, and you branch out from there. Instead of skills in previous games, most stats are tied to the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system, and extra abilities come from perks, which function as usual, except this time you can find bonus perks in magazines hidden in the world, as well as bonus perks for maxing out your companions relationships. And speaking of those, the karma system is gone as well, replaced with doing actions that your companion will like. That does mean however, that you can be very schizophrenic with your choices without really feel like it’s having the impact it used to, especially if you don’t have a companion with you. But while we are on combat, it’s worth noting that the shooting mechanics are the best they have ever been, guns feel responsive and the hundreds of mods you can attach to them means that even that early shotgun you found at level 5 can still be a force of nature if you keep it updated. The VATS system returns but no longer freezes time, but instead slows it, again a more grounded choice but it feels more welcome than the changes in dialogue. Power armor is no longer just another piece of armor to equip, but a suit you get into, with the same level of customization as the guns and other armor pieces, it almost encourages you to collect as many as you can, so sure enough, I have a hangar full of power armor suits that would make Tony Stark’s heart melt. But for the first time, power armor really sounds like, well, power armor. Funding all of these upgrades is an increased focus on finding junk in the wasteland and scrapping it for materials. This is probably the best change from previous entries as it encourages exploration beyond just finding weapons armor and stimpacks. However, scrapping all of your junk in your inventory in the most efficient way possible often times means going to a settlement, dropping all of your junk in the ground, and selecting each and every piece for scrap. A ‘scrap all’ function would be incredibly welcome. Speaking of settlements, Fallout 4 has a bit of a base building mode, where you build houses, power, water, food and defenses for settlements to keep them safe. It can get incredibly addicting but, without the right perks, your resources are exclusive to each base, and while I eventually got the perk that lets me setup supply lines in between the bases, this led to me focusing only on one or two settlements, instead of ones across the map as it was probably intended. Beyond this, you have the story and quests, and while I did mention the main story as being stronger, the overall world fells as if it’s lacking some truly memorable characters in the world, with the exception of some of your companions. Fetch quests or ones simply boiled down to ‘go here and kill some guys’ are abundant, especially when you might find yourself on a repeating quest chain against your will, with your quest giver not even presenting the option to turn down the next quest, I’m looking at you Preston, you annoying bastard. I have yet to do all of the side quests in the game, or finish exploring the map in its entirety, so I’m holding my thoughts on the side quest quality until later, but there certainly are some memorable side quests, as well as great rewards for doing them. Graphically, it won’t blow your computer away from Project Cars, Witcher 3 or Arkham Knight, but it still looks great, using a modified version of the engine that ran Skyrim. Some of the age shows however, because while environments certainly are the best they have ever looked, animations are still a bit stiff and sometimes can just outright break. Speaking of breaking, F4 has significantly less bugs than the last 2 Fallout games did at launch, but that doesn’t mean it got away from them. Some quest bugs, graphical bugs, and the occasional need to restart arise. It’s been a lot worse, but still has room for improvement. If this is your first Fallout game, dive right in, I guarantee you will have a fantastic time. If you really loved the previous Fallout games, I want you to take a step back for a moment, and ask yourself why you enjoyed them so much. The role playing side is downplayed, but the exploration is as great as ever. The skills and karma are gone, but the moment to moment gameplay feels the best it’s ever been. It’s different, is the point I’m getting at, and with a new console generation typically comes to changes in the formula. Bethesda clearly wanted a tighter focus on character and story this time around, but if that doesn’t bother you, then go crazy. 8.5/10"
Fallout 4,RPG,Vanilla game is so deprived of originality that mods themselves are your only salvation to enjoy this game. Its a bethesda game so expect a high degree of broken codes and officially unpatched known issues. triple buffering naturally nukes your fps and causes your fps to be restricted to previously 30fps but now a gracious 60fps if you do not manually edit your .cfg file and change change your Ipresent to 0 instead of Ipresent 1 like its still 2004. If you can look past this typical bethesda tomfoolery then yeah its a enjoyable experience if you apply community patches and toy around with mods.
Fallout 4,RPG,"Fallout 4 is a very interesting one. I say if you get Fallout 4, you are going to want to download some mods as well as the Vanilla game is lacking something. But the story in the game is quite interesting and surprised me in the end. Fallout 4 is much different than the other Fallout games in ways but also very similar. If you were to ask me I would say to get this game and try and look around for some mods. (It's very simple just use vortex and nexus) and make your time more interesting while traveling around the Commonwealth."
Fallout 4,RPG,"I really liked the game before all this paid dlc crap came out, what the hell happened, I come back after a year and THIS ? COME ON. Dumbed down like this."
Fallout 4,RPG,the last decent bethesda game
Fallout 4,RPG,"If your looking for a game with an immersive story-line, awesome action and fun and enjoyable characters, then this game is for you. The story ark of this game is incredible it really makes you feel determined to help your character, that you can customize to an pretty extreme level, which is always just fun. Now the action in this game isnt good, its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fantastic, it just makes you want to go out in the wasteland and kill even more ghouls and super mutants. The game design of this game can be extremely impressive, but also dissapointing, the game has a lot of silly glitches that really shouldn`t be there, but over all I would give this game an 86/100."
Fallout 4,RPG,"I love Fallout 4, No I don't care if you don't. Or that it's ""not a good fallout game, not like the predecessors"" games change. get over it. I dont care that X is missing, or that Y is changed, There are things from other games I liked more than 4, but what was presented before me was still a very entertaining game. The graphics don't look bad. Graphics don't make a game either. I don't care that the game has bugs, I'm not a whiny idiot and I know how to fix the problems myself rather than sit there and complain about it. Only thing I don't like is that the diner machine won't give me my damn pie. 1/10"
Chicory: A Colorful Tale,"Adventure, Indie, RPG","Chicory is a very elegant game, with a lot of tricks up it's sleeve to make you smile. Definitely not Doom."
The Flame in the Flood,"Action, Adventure, Indie","Not a real survival game, the artwork is amazing but mostly its a pain in the a** to play it. especially rafting is not fun and there is no storyline, you just begin the game, hop on the raft and done."
The Flame in the Flood,"Action, Adventure, Indie",สนุกดีครับ เล่นเพลินๆเลย
The Flame in the Flood,"Action, Adventure, Indie","I won this game from Steamgifts. A bit limited survival game with a kinda story mode. Endless mode is pretty boring and it does not offer anything different. Overally game is fun and graphics looks good. Controls are a little problematic sometimes and to get some of the achievements you need to do others before. At story mode, in mid-game, game becomes really repetetive but game isn't long so it won't matter much."
The Flame in the Flood,"Action, Adventure, Indie","♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME! I don't even know where to start? This is another Unreal ""Poorly Optimized"" Engine game. Controls are bad, especially on boat section where it just playing itself."
Subnautica: Below Zero,"Adventure, Indie",lol playing as a girl? thats stupid. should've gave us the option to play as a man. thanks for the refund!
Subnautica: Below Zero,"Adventure, Indie","WAS HOPING TO experience the ""Glorious blue terror is back... I have huge phobia of deep water but cant stop playing Subnautica series, its just awesome underwater survival with a very interesting sci-fi story line."" yet got stuck in a place where I just saved and couldnt move anywhere due to a bug, hours of game completely ruined, had to abandon my gameplay and uninstall the game."
Shantae: Risky's Revenge - Director's Cut,"Action, Adventure, Indie","This was a good game, took around 5 hours to beat, it's silly, a little confusing, but it has it's charm. Maybe too simple, but good enough for a handheld 2010 game."

Insurgency: Sandstorm,Action,"The best of times, as one might say. 8/10"
Insurgency: Sandstorm,Action,"Its fun, but when a game starts shoehorning in micro transactions for weapon skins,  you know it's dying. Edit 2021 Now they're porting really stupid Chinese themed skins from Fortnite. (No, really) The skins are out of theme, they were made by Epic Games for THEIR game, not Sandstorm. Players hate them. even the Chinese that NWI is trying to sell out and simp for hate them. What a joke."
Insurgency: Sandstorm,Action,Good games
Insurgency: Sandstorm,Action,yes
Insurgency: Sandstorm,Action,weird game my dad who served in iraq started screaming
Insurgency: Sandstorm,Action,"tries to combine the arcade milsim with semi-realism of red orchestra/rising storm with the fast pace sprinting and stopping to kill, repeat of call of duty game modes. feels like wasted potential in such small arenas with low player count games. In conclusion it is a cosplay that combines two games into an abomination akin to chris chans infamous sonichu"
Insurgency: Sandstorm,Action,Fun.
Insurgency: Sandstorm,Action,slurp...not bad slurp
Insurgency: Sandstorm,Action,"There's a guy in this game that screams incomprehensibly in Russian and despite not having a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ clue what he's saying, I think he summarizes my post-game emotions pretty well."
Insurgency: Sandstorm,Action,"It's a great hard-core FPS game but not so complex as Arma,and its founders keeps free updating it. And wish there's more no-respawn game mode."
Age of Empires® III (2007),"Simulation, Strategy","The skirmish mode and by extension mp are fine, but f*cking hell the sp campaign sucks sh*t."
Age of Empires® III (2007),"Simulation, Strategy",Good Game! Definitely recommended!!!
Atom Zombie Smasher,"Indie, Strategy","Still a classic after all these years. Fun tactical zombie defense/rescue game that has some light world map control on top. Requires strategic and on-your-feet thinking. Highly random, the units you get, zombie spawns, and events can have a big impact on what you can do.  But you can tweak tons of variables when starting a game so it suits your preferences. Works well via Remote Play Together, splitting responsibilities with a friend was a lot of fun, although the first two maps are slow due to having fewer units/abilities. Not a ton of replay value, once you've beat it a couple times there's not much more to see. Recommended on sale if you're looking for a clever game to plug 5-10 hours into."
Surviving the Aftermath,"Simulation, Strategy","This game seems promising but definitely does not live up to the point. Firstly, most of the things is not explained, like item levels or sicknesses, you cannot even find any information at the help section. Even though core gameplay isn’t bad, DLCs make it much worse with a lot of combat or micro management. Also, they are half done. You can find the review of the DLCs below. In relation to that, new raider or blight creatures at the map are plain annoying. You get constant attacks from the raiders and other creatures at the map or your settlement. You can see that the game is half finished and not cared about. First implication of this is seeing half of the resource names being broken at the top bar. Then, you notice you cannot upgrade the roads automatically; clicking is hard sometimes, if your specialist is near the target; sometimes people not going to the hospital or eat food, you cannot control or slow down the births, while some of the warnings being misleading (like stock is full or someone is malnourished). If you save and load you can get rid of these fake warnings at least. After that, you notice that your pc with liquid cooling system is burning (top of the line games do not have this effect) and you find out that even the best computers are in the same situation. The reason for that developers promising that they will optimize the games 3 years ago and did not care at all. With that, you can see that the game is abandoned for more than 1 year. There were no updates after the last DLC and lot of things are left broken or half-done. Unfortunately, some of the achievements are not unlocked correctly (You have to not be an ally to the last settlement, while maximizing the relations.). Because of this game, I think I am not going to purchase any Paradox game in the future and definitely, I do not recommend this game to anyone. Rebirth An annoying DLC which cancels some of the base game’s monsters (sandworms, some bandits at the settlement), while turning the game an action game. Also, blight buildings are mostly useless. One building allows you to terraform to increase the fertility but it is more like late game thing which will make it too late use. Other buildings are about blight only. Blight makes your game constant combat at map and at your settlement which was the main reason I hated this DLC. Plus, I had to pay more than the base game at sales for this DLC which was another annoying point for me. Forgotten Tracks I got this one with the bundle without even trying the purchase this. However, this is the only decent DLC. Shattered Hope Space rock DLC allows you to overtime your buildings for space rock. However, trying pick the areas again and again is another micro management.  For some reason moon rock makes people work harder. By the way, how the hell the moon is shattered and falling apart piece by piece? It is not even trying to be plausible. Other than that, there is a new happiness-like mechanic named hope which feels like a chore. Because you have to treat the angry people at a new building. Sadly, that building can take 2 patients and for some reason hospitals don’t have psychiatry in this game. Also, you can have feast to give people hope but it is another late game thing (you won’t need it at late game), since it needs a lot of resources. Ultimate Colony Only a short quest which gives you a regular specialist and also unlocks two useless buildings. Radio tower’s only use is to start the quest, Martian wind turbine is just a wind turbine. Plus, there are two skins for flags which is another unnecessary addon. New Alliances A new system that makes the settlements more detailed. It gives some requests to increase the relationship. Weirdly, their only use is trading with them, while relationship status does not change the prices. There are building that you can build to the other settlements but buildings have no real impact. Sadly, alliance or federation do not stop the annoying sabotages as they said. The buildings that can protect you from the sabotages requires manpower with electricity. Also, probably one of them won’t be enough and there 4 different types. So, at least 4x2 buildings and that makes it too much to be viable. Other than that, there is no reason to sabotage other settlements or be their enemies. There are lots of thing to the at the map and since the raiders keep coming with this great DLC, there will be some other things to do. Obviously, like all DLCs, this one makes the game more painful with constant raiders at the map and sabotages at the settlement. Also, this DLC is overpriced like the other ones."
Surviving the Aftermath,"Simulation, Strategy","This game is full of unintuitive systems that punish you for not knowing how they work. If you like this game conceptually I recommend you check out Endzone instead. An example of what I'm talking about is the starting tech system. You cannot generate science without unlocking specific techs and the game will let you spend your finite starting science on other unrelated techs, leaving you locked out of the tech tree. And without science income, you might as well quit. Within the first 30 in-game days you need to be constantly unlocking tech in order to keep your colony from collapsing. The tutorial doesn't warn you about this. The game's unsearchable help doesn't tell you to rush outposts. It's an arbitrary weird system that drops you into a failure state without warning. The only way to avoid it is to know beforehand how it works, either from experience or from an external source. And that's pretty much how the whole game is built. Simple tasks like making clothes require 3 separate tech unlocks, so by the time you know there's a problem you're screwed. You can unlock buildings that need materials you haven't researched yet. Resource gathering buildings cost their own resource to build. It doesn't help that the tutorial prompts are flat out terrible, frequently instructing you to perform tasks that have no bearing on your colony's survival or to construct buildings that you're literally hours away from researching. I like to figure out a game's systems by trying things out instead of watching an instructional video or following a step by step guide. This game punishes that approach at every turn, in ways that feel unfair and nonsensical."
Surviving the Aftermath,"Simulation, Strategy",That's a pretty awesome game
Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines,Action,"This isn't a love story, this is a horror story Before Twilight came along and tarnished the reputation of the beloved vampire there was this game. This game is one of a kind and still holds a major cult following with some gamers and I see why. The story is simple. You're a very unlucky guy or gal that gets turned into a vampire in Santa Monica, CA and you are given full freedom to feed and kill whoever with of course a set guidline with the ""Masquerade"". From the get-go you are left to your own devices and are given the choice to build the character YOU want. However the retail the version of the game isn't perfect and it's highly recommended to install and unofficial patch that improves the game but at the cost of having to start a new game. I say pick this game up whenever and start sinking your teeth into some miserable sod."
Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines,Action,really good game buy it
Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines,Action,"I always thought of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines as an overrated title when people would recommend it to me, then I bought it, installed it and now I'm hyperfocusing on this game and regretting all those years that I didn't give this game the time of day."
Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines,Action,"Deus Ex with Vampires. Do you like the movie Blade? Do you like TV shows like The Sopranos and Game of Thrones? Do you think vampires are sexy? Are you a fan of horror lore, stealth games or First Person RPGs that aren't just an FPS with some numbers and stats thrown in? If you answered ""Yes"" to all these questions, you need to get this game. An excellent introduction to the World of Darkness setting and one of the best Role Playing Video Games ever made. Not to mention, the very first game to use the source engine. The combat is mostly stat based, but the game does use hitboxes. Shooting will feel spongy unless you put points into Fire-Arms. There is a Third Person camera view, but I find it mostly cumbersome outside of the melee combat, where the game will only ever use a Third Person view. I like this, because melee in 2000 shooters was always very clunky. The combat is still a little clunky here, but it certainly feels better than something like Morrowind. The shooting is mostly fine provided you have enough puts in the skill, but the shotgun always plays the full reload animation even if you only load in one round. I found it easier to switch weapons than reload it when being rushed because of this. However, there is actually very little combat in this game, in comparison to the amount of story and role playing going on. This game really builds its world and often times its best just to put points into stealth and go that route. You are a vampire after all. Best played with mods. The Unoffical Patch and Clan Quest are great ones to start with. There are various graphical enhancements and texture packs listed on the Nexus and mod DB that vastly improve the games visuals. It still looks old, but not quite as old as it is."
Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines,Action,"So, I almost refunded the game because it isn't natively patched to work on a modern OS, Something about giving false errors of insufficient memory.  Which is strange for a game that's supposed to run on the Source Engine, an engine I thought was pretty solid. It's actually a pain in the ass to get running, Steam shouldn't be selling a game that requires third party and unofficial patches to run. I'll get this out of the way, I dont care about the vampire genre, recent movies kind of gave it a bad name anyway. Decided to pick the game up since it was 75% off, it runs off the source engine,  and despite not having any interest in the genre, I heard a lot of good things about it. I will say that I enjoy the came nonetheless,  It's been a long time since I played a focused RPG game like this, and I particularly like the grungy, and somewhat ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics and art style.  it's nostalgic and reminds me of games I played about 7 years ago."
Red Dead Redemption 2,"Action, Adventure",hunted rabbits for 2 hours for 3 perfect pelts 10/10
Red Dead Redemption 2,"Action, Adventure","There's a lot that I wish was different about Red Dead Redemption 2. After about 750 hours across various platforms, it's gotten a lot easier to notice the repetitive, restrictive mission structure really conflicts with the freedom of the open world. Realism is often chosen at the expensive of fun. Don't even get me started on the wanted system. ...But despite it all, I love this game so much. The characters are written so beautifully and intelligently. The world is stunning. The soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard. I may have criticisms, but I will never stop loving Red Dead Redemption 2."
Red Dead Redemption 2,"Action, Adventure",crveno mrtvo iskupljenje
Red Dead Redemption 2,"Action, Adventure",Graphic is beautiful. Damn. Edit: Please don't hurt yourself and try to play bad guy. Playing as totally bad cowboy is really not covered by this game. I wasted my time doing so as EVERY little outcome in game is literally the same. Endgame is the same.  Morgan acts the same. I'm a bit disappointed. Just play as good guy.
Red Dead Redemption 2,"Action, Adventure",good game
Red Dead Redemption 2,"Action, Adventure","amazing game 9/10 (spoiler) best part in the game is when Dutch says to Hosea ""we really are the red dead redemption 2"" really puts into perspective on what these characters are going through."
Red Dead Redemption 2,"Action, Adventure","Great game with an excellent story, great world and graphics with an open world which you can do anything. As always, Rockstar’s writing is really good and giving a lot of option of exploring the world feels great. Although, there is no reason for doing the challenges or any other thing, since it provides some cosmetics for the most part (like hunting). Money is a bit useless, after some time and using “e” for everything was a bit problematic but wasn’t that bad."
Red Dead Redemption 2,"Action, Adventure","Cant Yee haw quite like this here game. A masterpiece, but the online as gta5 has alot of work to go with anti-cheat and overall gameplay"
Red Dead Redemption 2,"Action, Adventure","The game shows how much Rockstar Games has grown throughout the years with their superb attempt in storytelling. This is definitely the best cowboy simulator there is! Figuratively, since the RPG elements are surprisingly addictive and should set the standard for open world games. The attention to detail is jawdropping. I love how the game puts you into different emotions like suspicion, skepticism, sadness, anticipation and satisfaction all at a great pacing. The horses are like the cars of GTA V where every physiological aspect is catered to wow the gamer. The game is labeled mature, not because of R Rated content,but its also because Rockstar Games has matured in terms of concepts discussed in-game and how it carefully treads the story of the very charismastic, dependable and gritty Arthur Morgan. Here are my ratings. ~ DIFFICULTY ~ 🔲 My 90 year old grandma could play it 🔲 Easy 🔲 Normal ✅ Hard 🔲 Dark Souls It has many mechanics but you can finish the game without cheats. ~ GRAPHICS ~ 🔲 MS Paint 🔲 Bad 🔲 Meh 🔲 Graphics don't matter in this game 🔲Good ✅ Beautiful 🔲 Masterpiece Far Cry 5's Montana is more lush than the RDR2 world, I think it needs more of a filter but, I think Rockstar is going with more realism in perspective than immersion. ~ MUSIC ~ 🔲 Bad 🔲 Not special 🔲 Good ✅ Beautiful The Americana viral songs are even in-game. Rockstar really loves pop culture references ~ STORY ~ 🔲 This game has no story 🔲 Like playing Temple Runners for the story 🔲It's there for the people who want it 🔲Well written 🔲 Epic story ✅ Imagine Kingdom Hearts but on crack Jesus, need I say more? RDR2 is one of the most novel-worthy video games out there. The extreme simplicity on how they approached stories but left players with characters you will instantly remember. It reminds me of Kingdom Come Deliverance, Witcher 3 and Uncharted with how they handle side characters in a sense that it intrigues you no matter the NPC is ~ PRICE ~ 🔲 Free 🔲 Underpriced ✅ Perfect Price 🔲 Could be cheaper 🔲 Overpriced 🔲 Complete waste of money It's expensive for a reason. I just dont like how theres no video mode like in GTA V. ~ REQUIREMENTS ~ 🔲 You can run it on a microwave 🔲 Average 🔲 High end ✅ NASA computer I am running on 120fps stable but damn. its not as optimized as GTA V. The best way to approach this game is to look for benchamarks online and mix and match to see whats fit for your PC. You need a very high end PC unfortunately or go with PS4 ~ LENGTH ~ 🔲 Very Short (0 - 2 hours) 🔲Short (2 - 15 hours) 🔲 Average (15-50 hours) 🔲 Long (50-90 hours) 🔲 Extremely long (90-110 hours) ✅ No ending I actually dont want it to end. I've played this longer than it should It just didnt reflect on my steam due to Rockstar issues ~ FUN ~ 🔲 I'd rather watch paint dry 🔲 Hard to enjoy 🔲 Repetitive 🔲 Actually pretty amusing 🔲The kind of fun you'll remember ✅ Ride of your life It's the only game where I am patient enough to WALK. Yes I prefer to walk than sprint because of how amazing the environmental ambience there is ~ REPLAYABILITY~ 🔲 It's a one-time experience 🔲 Only for achievements 🔲 If you wait a few months/years ✅ Definitely 🔲 Infinitely replayable Because its a world where your actions can impact the playthrough I guess being very bad guy or very good guy is a good playthrough replay ~ WORTH BUYING ~ 🔲 No ✅ Wait for sale ✅ Yes 8.5/10 I love it!"

Skullgirls 2nd Encore,"Action, Indie","The only reason why I'm not refunding this game is because I didn't buy it. Virtue signalling doesn't make society better, it actively degrades it. How about instead of jerking/fingering yourselves off, you actually make a REAL positive difference in the world? Ego masturbation to make yourself FEEL like a good person, without actually doing anything to BE a good person, is literally the exact OPPOSITE of BEING a good person. Remember back in the 90's when *sshole politicians tried to scapegoat Doom as being responsible for Columbine? This is the exact same bad faith argument. Cut it the f*ck out already you scummy dirtbags."

Hardspace: Shipbreaker,Simulation,"It is a pretty good game, love dismantling those things! Also, I even saw some liberals/corpo-bootlickers butthurting in the game's Steam forum and reviews, so it is definitely a recommended from me. :)"
Hardspace: Shipbreaker,Simulation,It's a great game to play when you want to relax and just overall great.
Hardspace: Shipbreaker,Simulation,"The story is too thin to waste as much time as the game does in unskippable bits of dialog. But the basic game play is surprisingly fun! There is nothing like having a reactor blow up in your face and knowing that it is all your damn fault for getting too tricky or doing things too fast. I think it is missing something that makes you feel pressure, though, or at least a game mode where you feel more pressure. Once you get into it it really is a pure puzzle game, as there is no meaningful force compelling you to work faster. In this way the game play doesn't match the story line at all."

The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut,"Action, RPG",A little dated but story and book references are still awesome
The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut,"Action, RPG","There are lots of problems with first Witcher game. However, game is a bit old and you can understand why these problems exist. I had many crashes while I was playing, there are lots of fetch quests like some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MMO, event triggers some times does not make sense at all and quest path doesn't make sense sometimes, it will annoy you if you are a completionist. Plus, combat mechanics are unresponsive at some of the positions and of course combat is pretty boring. Difficulty curve isn't so good at the game too. The game offers you a bit of challange at first chapter, and then it gets easier and easier like most of the RPGs. However, end of the chapter one was annoying for me. Because of unbalanced situation for some developement trees I guess. Because lots of people say it was pretty easy fo them, I played at the hardest mode by the way. Cutscenes were annoying and combat was RNG a bit at hard mode. I died like 20 times at that part. But still, I can't say it is a bad game, story is pretty good, especially if you think it as a part of the other Witcher games. Lore is pretty neat, I mean it is from a book series, of course it will be good. Also leveling gives you some satisfaction. For expansions, I only enjoyed the official ones and the Wedding one. Wedding one was hilarious and it is my favourite."
The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut,"Action, RPG","This is a review that's been three years in the making and to you, you're probably wondering ""why does that matter"".  To put it bluntly, the original Witcher is a uniquely ambitious game with a very antiquated and frustrating gameplay loop that for most modern gamers will be a little intimidating, especially if your introduction to this series was either the second or third game. But despite that frustration, The Witcher is probably one of the most engrossing and rewarding RPG experiences I have played in recent memory, due to the fact that it works as foreshadowing for the next installments with references to The Wild Hunt, a cliffhanger that leads into the second game, and reference for what may come in the recently announced fourth game. It's remarkable that CDPR planned out this universe from the get go, and for that alone I commend them for that level of ambition and effort, especially since you can import your save from this game into the second, creating a seamless story. It's a narrative marvel that carries this game, and it's further elevated with the branching paths and decisions you can make, and yeah in 2022 that may not sound remarkable but back in 2008 it was, and to have those actions brought up in the following game is also great. But enough gushing about the story and narrative beats. I need to lay into the negative, which is the thing that may push people away. To put it bluntly, the combat in this game is janky, unremarkable, and sometimes dreadful on occasions. I understand that back in 2008 CDPR probably didn't have the resources to streamline the combat, or they were trying to go for a traditional but ""unique"" take, but even that statement can't pad out or excuse how bad it is. Essentially, combat boils down to whether you're going to fight monsters or humans and even though the former is more common you still fight humans just as much, and I state this because you carry two swords, silver for monsters, and steel for humans, it's a staple of the franchise that no fan can forget but when both weapons have their own separate skill trees for all three fighting styles you are left feeling a little stuck between which to invest in, at least I did, because as stated you have three fighting styles that are tailored for certain situations. These styles are self-explanatory in concept, but poor in delivery, Strong is for the big uglies that need an extra bit of a wallop to put down, fast is for the nimble freaks you can't hit with your regular brute strength, and group is for when you're completely surrounded and singling out individual foes is not an option. Execution of these styles boils down to standing still, clicking on them, and waiting for your mouse to light up indicating when to score a hit or link a combo, essentially boiling down to this tedious song and dance of stationary @$$ whoopin' that can get a little tiresome and most definitely can take you out of the action. Spells/signs are another feature that in theory sound cool but honestly boil down to you most likely using two (or three) out of the five given spells, and that's what I usually did. Either resorting to Aard which functions as a force push that stuns enemies or Igni which is your stock standard fire spell, I did use Quen sometimes which gives you a temporary bubble shield but when you have potions that almost trivialize some of the combat I don't really feel like it's necessary in most cases. The other two spells are Yrden is a trap spell that repels enemies and Axii is a mind control ability that makes enemies passive for the most part, but again I never used those two since I could easily repel enemies with a well-placed Aard blast or Igni blast. All in all the combat is weird and definitely the one thing I struggled with early game because from the get go you don't have a silver blade, and you only have the bare minimum of combat skills to manage threats and as I started off saying both silver and steel blades don't have a shared skill tree but instead separate trees for each respective fighting style. So if you were putting a lot of points into silver blade's strong, fast, and group, you have handicapped yourself when you finally fight humans which to me is annoying but from a narrative standpoint may make sense I guess but then again it's just that one thing that otherwise makes an already semi-frustrating system worse, however you can get use to it with time and by the midpoint of the game I got pretty good at quickly switching between the styles, so it's not *too* hard, but it's definitely an ambitious and janky mess that I grew to appreciate over time. Other than the combat being weird, I adore a lot of the world building, alchemy systems, mini-games, even if both of them are just glorified quests with one being unrepeatable after each phase's completion. This game oozes with the kind of creativity you want from an RPG and for this being CDPR's first major game it was a big undertaking to make everything work almost seamlessly and that alone makes this game worthwhile. I highly recommend The Witcher."
Hearts of Iron IV,"Simulation, Strategy",Doesn't make any sense lol
Hearts of Iron IV,"Simulation, Strategy","I think it probably surpasses HoI III.  It simplifies in all the right places while keeping the complexity where it is needed.  I think it is much more strongly an ""alternate history generator"" than HoI III."
Hearts of Iron IV,"Simulation, Strategy",That's the kind of a game which the players have a lot of hours playtime and yet still have no idea what's literally going on in naval battles. You will never ever learn the navy mechanics. Trust me.
Hearts of Iron IV,"Simulation, Strategy","When I got this game, I was very hesitant. I've never played a Paradox game before, or even just a in-depth strategy game like this before. At first it was so complicated looking to me that I was considering just getting a refund, but a couple friends said I should play a little more before making conclusions. So I looked up some basic videos on how to play as the German Reich efficiently, and now it is one of my most played games, and probably even on my top 10 list. Now I have also moved to playing some games with my cousins, who I introduced to it as well(they aren't usually into strategy based games either) and we had some great fun and continue to play the game today. Another one of my favorite things about HOI4 is that it has Steam Workshop support. So if the base-game gets boring, there is always the Great War mod or the Modern Day Mod you can try out. So I would say wait for a sale, buy the Cadet Edition, and give it a shot. Even invite a friend if you want."
Hearts of Iron IV,"Simulation, Strategy",Developers turned out to be incredibly greedy. Raising already high prices won't make you more profit. It will only alienate potential customers.
Hearts of Iron IV,"Simulation, Strategy",This game is actually pretty fun. A bit bugged if not followed historical path but still offers intresting gameplay for people like me who likes EU4 and WWII.
Hearts of Iron IV,"Simulation, Strategy","I bought this game about 3 years ago, and I wasted 6 hours with it and never touched it again, it left me with a bad taste and I wasn't happy with my purchase. However, I will say that like Stellaris and Civilization,  after taking some time to learn it,  I have actually come to like this game. I personally prefer just sandboxing in Singleplayer with mods. But I must say that the Production line system,  and the battle plans tool are my two favorite additions to the game, and they've really let me enjoy this over HOI3. Also, I forgot how much I hated playing the USSR. My brain isn't big enough to handle 300 divisions"

HITMAN World of Assassination,"Action, Adventure","The ai has the intelligence of a canned box of farts. it functions to a degree but dont expect them to have a realistic sense of self preservation beside crouching and screaming, then running towards you as you clearly aim your weapon at them. You might go and commit a rampage, only to see some npc's return to their previous actions and slurp on a cup of coffee while one of their co-worker lays on the floor in a pool of blood mere inches of their feets, acting as if nothing had really happened. The game is still alot of fun but i wish they would atleast upgrade the npcs to a more believable level."
HITMAN World of Assassination,"Action, Adventure",The ultimate hitman game 20/10
HITMAN World of Assassination,"Action, Adventure","although it had a rough launch + the stupid EPG 1 year exclusivity, Hitman 3 holds (or at least tries) to what makes these games fun. the fact that you get all 3 games in one for half the space (now it's 65~ GB for all 3 games) makes it very accessible to play the trilogy. what makes these games special is the creativity and freedom it allows you to play with. for every mission there are a lot of unique scenarios that totally depends on the player style and approach. although this game is so much fun and does some things well, it doesn't improve much and I still think Hitman 2 is the best part for the following reasons: ------ - Hitman3 has less maps than Hitman 1&2 - some maps feel linear and doen't offer the variety that Hitman2 offered. - A.I is dumb, and I mean REALLY DUMB. - so many glitches and some NPCs walk through walls or appear out of nowhere - still needs an internet connection to play and the servers are terrible. - IOI sell the games as DLCs just to confuse you into buying stuff you don't want at all."
HITMAN World of Assassination,"Action, Adventure","A murder-spy simulator unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality. Endless possiblities to achieve your objectives. Improved combat mechanics makes the front on approach as viable option as stealth. I admire it's purity."
HITMAN World of Assassination,"Action, Adventure","Hitman: World of retarded menus, braindead AI that literally breaks during the game, and random fugly butch lesbian black computer hacker girl stereotypes (Probably a self insert) that literally fulfills the diversity hire trope during the ICA infiltration mission. ""OOPS, LOOKS LIKE I FORGOT THAT ALERT AND UR ♥♥♥♥♥♥ LULZ - BETTER SET FIRE TO THE PLACE!!"" I uninstalled after giving the freelancer mode a shot......masterclassed the mission up until the end....where I found myself stuck in a locker at a dead end in the military base.....looking at 15 guards with glitched out AI.  I took 12 of them down before dying and lost the campaign...... I lost the campaign....because I died.....AFTER I took out the syndicate leader (Salesman) and was congratulated for eliminating them. ""This game was made by a diverse group of people!"" Trust me...The checkbox diversity hire quality work shows. I placed a spray can on a sand castle at the beach....guard walks over to me, ♥♥♥♥ talks me, tells me I'm wearing a disguise....then I got shot. Why? Because its a literal AI interaction dead end.

Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus,Action,"9/10 Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus shows that a game can have an absurdly fun plot while having relatable characters. Throughout the experience, I found myself rooting for the protagonist and his band of misfits. The game has a lot of character—throughout my playthrough, I was smiling and engaged. Combat is also a strong point of the game, giving the player a decent arsenal to tackle challenges by either stealth or head-on. Just keep in mind that depending on the difficulty level you set; you can either get your nazi killing-spree power fantasy or get your ass handed to you. The game has excellent graphics and surprisingly smooth performance. You can be sure that decapitating, disintegrating, or exploding nazi heads will be a treat. Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus would have been a perfect FPS action-exploration game; however, I cant look past the technical issues experienced. At the very least, this is playable compared to its predecessor: Wolfenstein: The New Order. Full Review [martopad.medium.com]"
Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus,Action,I saw teaters
Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus,Action,"New Colossus is definitely a side step from its predecessor. New Order felt like a ""return to form"" (I use that very loosely) while still being new. It had lovable characters and great writing while New Colossus lacks this. All the new characters are unlikable and the first half is unnecessarily difficult since spoilers B.J is critically injured from the events of New Order, meaning your health only regenerates to 50 or 70 I guess as a metaphor of him being half the man he used to be? The gun play is spectacular almost better than New Order's since B.J can interchange what weapons he wants to dual wield. However the story is just dreadful sometimes. They try to have very serious moments that are punctuated with jokes and it doesn't help with the new characters being gutter trash. I get that they are characters that survived intense trauma which has shaped them into who they are presently but none the less it just sours the experience a little. Grace is overly antagonistic and assertive towards the original crew, Spesh feels like a cartoon character, Wyatt. My boy Wyatt is a drugged up hippy now, and B.J is a depressed dead man walking that gets [SUPER REDACTED FOR SPOILER PURPOSES] but immediately gun-ho and ready to kill Nazi's again with finesse? The tone is everywhere but if you are a fan I would say play for yourself and form your own opinion. You might like it more then me so please play it for yourself but I have spoken my piece."
Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus,Action,"Great game play, but overall not as good as Old Blood or New Order. Also, there was some SJW garbage sprinkled around the game which I found to be annoying. 7/10"
Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus,Action,based arm
Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus,Action,"This wasn’t a good game for me sadly. Gameplay aspects are good for the most part but the story is too cheesy. Other games of the series are cheesy too but this at another level. Unfortunately, there are a lot cutscenes to make it even worse. Although, there is some meaning to the story at the beginning of the game with BJ’s dilemma, the game loses it very quickly. And honestly, I find the Nazi murdering part a bit over the top. I can say it is almost racist for some parts. Still, game length isn’t short if you can enjoy it which was another issue for me as you can understand. Other than that, there is an ironman option for this game which is terrible with its bugs. Even if I have to admit that shooter aspect of the game is decent, I can’t recommend it."

Hitman: Absolution™,Action,A good hitman game! Lacks a few features adds a few features all in all an ok deal. More weapons would have been better and the old loss of assassins like feeling is lost due to story progression. more like a vengeance story telling.

They're mainly own for their amazing stealthy missions and the protagonist AGENT 47. Hitman was a long-going series. Starting in 2000 and ending in 2020. The series is praised by a large number of people. The fanbase is divided into two groups. Either you like or you don't like it, there's nothing in between. For me, I enjoyed the game a lot. The missions had a lot more replay abilities than the previous titles ( previous titles are old therefore the gameplay is a bit clunky considering 2021). This game had some awesome moments. Awesome kills to get/pull off. The story felt very interesting and engaging. A47 is betrayed by the agency for something he did. Which I can't say because of spoilers. Regardless you will enjoy(?) the story. The Graphics of this game has aged well. You can play this game without squeezing your eyes. Character models are well done. There are multiple approaches to take down targets. Achievements do hunt. Sadly you can't do 100% on this game due to online being dead let alone online mode achievements. You can get your time get the perfect score/rank in a mission or rush it like a fool. It will take you around 15-25h depending on your play style. Overall highly recommended."
Hitman: Absolution™,Action,This is hands down my favourite hitman game in the franchise.

Magic Duels,"Free To Play, Strategy","Hello, as i played Magic The Gathering long ago while was a child i knew i gona like it. Anyway, game is really nice in few aspects like Arts (really awesome draws), single player campain (there is multi too ofc), mechanic & tutorial looks nice and You dont have to pay to collect deck (even if in my feeling its a bit slow progress). but there is a problem with Magic Duels. Game is extremly unstable for me. It looks more like beta or something in this case. I Played like 30 hours now, and encoured unlimited numbers of soft locks, frezzes, crashes and stability bugs (especially when clicking something that wasnt intended to be clicked in so kind of situations, or when player left game while I interacted with something). I had to edit this review and change from recommended to not. Sadly. Reasons are two. First, unstability of game is even more i suposed. I tried to convince my friend to play with me, but sadly for him, game doesnt even boot-up on 2 different pc's. Problem is old, and looks like developers dont want to fix it. Second thing is that i get really fast bored of it. Well i made a deck that gave me like 80% win ratio on 2 vs 2 games.. but problem is when i meet enemy there are same strategies and decks all around. Like sorry but people keep playing all the time with decks that removes cards from your library or stack +1/+1 counter every time that lands enter game.. and so. If all the time i see same tactics that means something is wrong. Its just boring no matter i win or not. To be fun, this game needs a loot of work, and sadly i dont think developer will try so when its ""free to play"". Cheers."
Magic Duels,"Free To Play, Strategy","The good: All the fun of magic in a free app! Even better is the purchase system which lets you purchase an entire collection in ~100 packs. You don't get repeats and the freeware currency value makes it reasonable to complete a set within a year or so without spending money. The bad: Unstable. Uses significant compute resources, and crashes in special situations. Play is a bit slow. The verdict: Not for me, but if you have some free time and more patience for crashes, I'd recommend it."

Assassin’s Creed® Rogue,"Action, Adventure","Assassin's Creed Rogue is a very strange entry that was released at a rather peculiar time since it was released on the exact same day as the then highly anticipated Assassin's Creed Unity and all I can say is that's a good way to kill a game immediately since not only was it released on the same day as Unity but it was the last entry on the seventh generation of consoles. So not only was it competing against a new game but also a game on the then next generation of consoles while it was on the previous generation. But with that out of the way I can say that this game is sort of the series black sheep in a lot of ways or at least one of many since for the first time in the series you are playing as a former assassin that has turned to Templars due various internal issues which I will say is pretty cool. It shows that the assassin's aren't exactly the clear cut heroes that they have always been and even though it makes things maybe a little convoluted I still think it's great getting this double perspective that lends a lot of credibility to what I would consider the ""Revolution"" saga since this is placed in between Haytham and Connors stories in AC3, pretty much serving as an expository entry that details the fall of the Colonial Assassin's leading into Connor's story as well as Arno's in Unity. And in all honesty at first I didn't like the idea of playing as a Templar but the more I played the more I began to understand the protagonists stance in the story. Shay Cormac may be the villain, but in the beginning he's not a heartless monster, he WANTS to do good for people and this is reflected beautifully by this games economy system. In previous entries we had villas, towns, homesteads, and of course piracy on our side but this time its a mix of the Ezio trilogies economy and the piracy of AC4 meaning you can renovate buildings for civilians via acts of naval combat all within an act of good will from Shay. I know it might seem pointless to mention the economy but when you're playing for the ""villains"" this time around you would think of something far more malicious but surprisingly its not. Ever since AC3 Ubisoft wanted to tell a more mature stories and I think Rogue is the crowning achievement with that promise because this entry establishes that not everyone is the good guy and that there's two sides to every story and this story was definitely the most gut wrenching in my opinion due to the fact you see a lot of familiar faces and get a lot of references to the beloved AC4. If you can handle the idea of an incredibly dark story I DEFINITELY recommend Rogue. It's definitely a story that needed to be told."
Assassin’s Creed® Rogue,"Action, Adventure","Played using max settings at 4K 60 fps (AMD Ryzen 3800x, RX 6800 XT and 32 GB DDR4 RAM) using a ReShade preset with SMAA. Gameplay: 8/10 - The peak of AC naval combat. Story: 7/10 - Decent story about disenchantment with the brotherhood Graphics: 7/10 - Environments in particular look great. Music and sound design: 6.5/10 - Love the twist on the main theme, not much else was memorable. Lots of low-quality audio in some scenarios, typical of Ubisoft. Replayability: 5/10 - Originally wanted to 100% but got burnt out and settled with 100% synch-ing the story. Assassin's Creed Rogue is an interesting entry in the franchise, being that you play the role of Shay Cormac, an assassin who was done wrongly by the brotherhood, thus making turning to the Templars. The story makes a good justification of why Shay did what he did; however, I cannot feel as though the characters were really forcing that decision onto him for the sake of the story. Sometimes, I felt like the game was just another Assassin's Creed game, but the color palettes were swapped. It was such a turn-off that ""assassin"" grunts in the game were nothing more than regular foot soldiers in military uniforms with tri-corn hats that basically had a label slapped on their back to say ""assassin"". It did not help that the British and French factions in the game had almost the exact same uniforms. They were uninteresting and went against everything the past franchise games had built up about the faction, in my opinion. If more time was spent making the assassins look more like they did in the past, it would have really helped with the immersion. The stalker mechanic was cool but got old quickly for me. Naval combat is at the best it has ever been since its inception in Assassin's Creed 3. It was satisfying, responsive, and immersive, especially with the detailed environments and water. The melee combat was the same as usual, and nothing to cry home about. Overall, I enjoyed playing through this game. I think it was overshadowed by Unity's release for the Xbox One and PS4 consoles. To be honest, with how this game's story ended, it should have released as a standalone game for all consoles to give Unity another year in the oven. Releasing Unity the following year would have left it time to polish and it would transition to Arno Dorian's story nicely. This is a great Assassin's Creed game worth picking up for the low, or with the rest of the franchise if it is on sale."

The length of the game is perfect, reminds me of firewatch where you always have radio contact with a person som it doesnt feel so Lonely walking around in the empty world.

BIT.TRIP Presents... Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien,"Action, Casual, Indie","I'm not quite sure what I expected before I played Runner2, probably another obstacle course with the same clear-cut pixel graphics and simple charm of the prequel Runner, perhaps with a bit more underlying menace or excitement pursuant to a Rhythm Alien which apparently featured in it. What I got was something with the same basic gameplay, but with a lot of extras. Extras? Extras are good, right? If you played the first Runner, there was almost nothing more satifying than getting an extra, then speeding along with the music at full audibility, collecting gold with a rainbow contrail stretching to infinity. Sadly though, in this version, extras result in a watery rainbow which trails sadly in your wake, and the music doesn't really noticably change throughout the course of a level. I suppose that anything less wouldn't fit the new 'style' of the game. No, these extras are the normal sort of game extras, extra characters and collectable outfits and a 'reward' system. Collectible outfits? If you're still thinking of the first BIT.TRIP Runner, you may be wondering how that works. I could tell you the first outfit was a pair of earbuds, and you might wonder if that meant whitining a couple pixels on the Runner's ears. Not to fear though, it's all part of the new 'style'. At the beginning of the game, a smarmy narrator informs you that CommanderVideo has been sucked into an alternate dimension, while fighting in some manner of justice league. A new world awaits, with a lot more living things, and more importantly, real 3D graphics. I don't feel that 3D graphics really do much for the game. I felt that my runner was not a s responsive due to the slower nature of the jump animation. In fact, starting out, the overhangs on staircases would always make me trip, as I was used to a more 2D perspective from playing the first runner. Moreover, when I tripped, the runner would swim backwards like an octopus, at a constant rate no matter where I was in the level, which was really irratating if I tripped towards the end (compare Runner, where returning to the start took a fixed amount of time, no matter what). The presence of a lot more living things is worse for the feel of the game, though. In the first runner, the living things include huge tunneling worms, fish, clouds with mustaches, and trampolines with eyes. What all of these have in common though is that they are separated from your gameplay. None of them are beneficiaries or detractors to your Herculean run. Your enemies, such as they are, are robots. In Runner2, the first thing you see is a spike-thing sitting in the road. Then, as you go further on, a drunken pickle registers you at a checkpoint. This makes the aesthetic lonliness which the first game had impossible to acheive. End the level, and a sign flips to tell you it's an ""Amazing Acheivement!"". If you've collected all the gold, you no longer get to go to a fiendishly difficult bonus level, but instead get fired out of a cannon. As the game mechanics were introduced I noticed another thing I didn't like about this sequel, namely, the trigger keys no longer did what they used to. I really enjoyed using A+RTrigger to Jump-kick in the first Runner, but in the second it was not to be. All in all the game comes off as extremely patronizing, with it's hollow achievement system (called 'rewards' for some reason) and its collect all the costumes mentality, which bothers me much more in the face of the sink or swim of the first Runner. It has some promising new mechanics that the first one did not, but they don't necessarily play out. An example is tracing a circle with your right stick, an idea I thought was pretty novel until I realized it had absolutely no impact on the game besides earning extra points. In an effort to enjoy the game more, I switched to the drunken pickle as soon as I possibly could, so that I might be able to enjoy the game for what it was, instead of comparing it to the first runner. A fine idea, though at the character change screen I was briefly greeted by the monstrousity that is CommandgirlVideo. For heavens sake, I believe that collection of black pixel which comprised the protagonist of the first Runner was gender neutral, for that matter, so is the word 'Commander'. Is there any purpose for a second amalgamation of pixels with secondary sexual characteristics other than to alienate half the population from the main protagonist? Do the words 'separate but equal' ring any bells? In any case, I continued playing the game, pretending now that it was the adventures of drunken pickle. I was plesantly releived that noone seemed present at any of the checkpoints, but drunken pickle's extra mode was an all-green rainbow, which should, in any reasonable game, be an oxymoron. I finished off the level, and defeated the boss. But then came a cut scene, featuring CommanderVideo going pointlessly into a whale, even though I'd been playing with drunken pickle the whole time. And then the checkpoints were populated again, by a crab man in a hut. And then I lost interest, and let the game run on to give me Steam Card drops while I wrote this review. So, in conclusion, Runner is better. If you were thinking about playing this game, play Runner. If you've already beaten Runner, go back and do all the challenges, or do it on Perfect mode. If you've already beaten it on perfect mode, then grab your square frames, put them on, and meet me in the cafe down the street, which serves 100% economically sourced coffee-flavored foam, and we can chat about how the first Runner was so much better, before BIT.TRIP went mainstream. Bottom line: Though Runner2 may be better played with a controller, it's better to play the original Runner with that contoller."
Tribes of Midgard,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG",Meh.
Armello,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy","There's a lot to love here, but i'm just not compatible with it. Every time i reinstall and play this game (3 times in the last 2 weeks alone), i have a pretty good time until i run into another, new design decision that is so strange i lose all interest in continuing -- until i do again. So, it was a love-hate relationship until just today, and, well, there's always the straw that breaks the camels back, right? It's certainly not even a big deal, quite a small rule interpretation: When the lady bear attacks a corrupted creature, she uses her spirit stat instead of the attack stat. Fine, easy enough. But, then i would also expect, based on the generalized language, that when i have 2 corruption and then attack an enemy player with 6, shouldn't my spirit stat be used during combat instead of my attack? Fine, mistakes made. Live and learn, maybe? I've done that enough with this game, i think. More bad decisions off the top: - Can't speed up the first game played (after prologue) -- and this game needs it all the time. - Camera's auto-follow breaks after your turn, even if you didn't move it or put it into manual mode. - Speaking of the camera, two things: you can't zoom out very far at all -- certainly don't expect a board-level view -- and, to add insult to injury, a thick fog is wafted over the landscape at increasingly opaque amounts as you do zoom out, making for anything but the absolute closest zoom level blurry. - Certain rules are just plain barely/never explained. Looking at poison, the corruption stat, and exploding dice, among others. - Various other rule caveats that are not explained, which isn't always a terrible thing; however, making even small mistakes can often snowball your bad fortunes out of control. - On the bright/also-dark side, if you're winning, you'll feel like a million bucks. That's because there's a runaway-leader problem too. Multiple paths to victory doesn't mean all those paths are viable for any particular character, nor depending on a given point in the game. - Companions are vastly under-seen/available/used. (There's also a pull-your-hair-out, ""mischievous"" ""companion"" you might just get forced into having as well.) - Randomization is out of hand. I'm not talking about the dice. Dice are great, love the dice. I just don't like it in all of the other parts of the game. Which is everywhere. - Rewards and monetization of this game are questionable, in general. All of these things feel like idiocy, especially when many seem like quick fixes. They're painful to see and more painful to experience -- over and over again. There's a lot of good too, but the bad has overwhelmed it for me. I wish it was just a bit better. Or maybe i would have made the same review at 100 hours even if it was. Maybe it needs to be a lot better. It's hard to tell."
Armello,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy","Meh.  The base concept is neat and the visuals are fantastic, but in the end, it comes down to two sides just rolling dice at each other.  Every game I played devolved into the same thing over and over.  It was enjoyable, but just got boring after a few games. And don't get me started on the microtransactions.  The game is very upfront about ""Hey, look at the characters you can't play!"" It even has its own in game store to encourage this, because apparently relying on the steam store doesn't hassle the user enough or something."
Armello,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",This is not only a game ! It is an experience. Each game is a new trip. Weir situations happens. Replayability is incredible. Lots of surprises ! Very nice moments awaits for boardgame lovers. Very addictive.

Great strategic game, forgiving for disconnects or when you get ganged up on unfairly and need to step out. I highly recommend getting this if you like Catan and similar games. This isn't Chutes and Ladders or Monopoly, but it is STILL a blast to play."
Armello,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",Thumb up
ASTRONEER,"Adventure, Indie","It is another game that is only enjoyable to play with friends. It has a great atmosphere of planets and discovering them for the first time is really great. However, game is a bit repetitive and after a while, your main occupation is resource gathering, maybe automating. As you can guess, that part is pretty boring. Sadly, there are also a lot of bugs and controls are not great, especially flatting the terrain. Definitely, I would not play this game solo but as I said before, it is enjoyable with friends. Also, developers added a lot of free content as missions and new items but I do not think they are implemented well or have great mechanics (other than aliens). Another negative point is having no option for base building as other games. I think this system aims to be practical only, there is not much to design for appearance. Plus, there can be only 4 people at the server which is not a great option for modern games but it would not matter if you are not a crowded party. Lastly, I would recommend purchasing this game at sales, since it has a great price at sales."
ASTRONEER,"Adventure, Indie","Good game really, I enjoyed it this far, highly promising, hope they dont abandon or frak up the game in future updates."
SpellForce 3 Reforced,"RPG, Strategy","After some time spend in the game I have to change my review from positive to negative. Although game has great potential with superb voiceacting, graphics, interesting storyline and rpg elements it is all bogged down by: - lack of active pause (This game transforms from very player-friendly to a micromanagement hell  as you progress in the storyline forcing you to manually controll every hero, skill, building, worker, soldier, gatherer and about 7 bases at the same time. I can't describe how bad it becomes.) - loading crashes (I had like 40 restarts cause of that and I'm fed up) Shame, I really had hopes for this and I liked it very much at the beginning."
SpellForce 3 Reforced,"RPG, Strategy","Mechanically, this game is an interesting fusion of a kind of Baldur's Gate-esque RPG and Warcraft-esque RTS game.  I think it is successful at fusing those two genres, thus my thumb up.  That being said, my hope was that the game would transcend the two genres, neither of which is my most favorite type of game, but that isn't the case.  The lore/narrative is nothing you haven't seen before, and the gameplay on the two ""sides"" is not particularly innovative.  If you really like both genres, its worth buying on sale, you may enjoy it much more than I did.  But I'm not unhappy I bought it."

It's unbelievable to me that in 2023, you can't invite your friends to join a match. This should be simple and easy to do.

This game has the flexibility to cater to those who either want a hardcore mil-sim experience or want a more relaxed arcade style game."

Pillars of Eternity,RPG,"If you enjoyed games like Baldurs Gate you will just enjoy this one aswell. It looks better, maybe its not such a 'WOW' like Witcher 3, but its a bit more old school game. I've noticed some bugs with text in polish version, however not that many. I didnt like one thing in this game. There are plenty of NPCs who's history you can see in the visions, however it goes no any step deeper. Like.. there is no any chat or quest related to it so after reading like 20 of them i just started to skip it. Dont get me wrong, the stories were pretty interesting, but as i had only 2 days of my weekend to play the game i could not afford to read it all the time, if it dosnt affect my campaign at all. Anyway its worth playing if you are RPG games addicted. Cheers and take it on sale! Edit: Please do not make my mistake: 1. Do not play with talk options that requirements are not meet visible - on. It ruined my game experiance as i always reach near end of act 2 then decided to create new character just to have ""more interesting dialog lines"". In the end i keept creating it, play to act 3 then start over again. Just enjoy game without knowing what ""could you miss"". 2. Install game on SSD.. i made this mistake and believed it could be on my HDD to save my SSD storage. Map loading takes ages.. install it on ssd to not suffer like me. Game is not well created to play strict evil character.. however its still interesting."
Pillars of Eternity,RPG,"Pillar of Eternity is a highly acclaimed game but I have no idea why. I had many problems with the game and I had to force myself to finish the game or explore the world, since it was pretty boring for me. In addition to that, game feels like an old game more than an old-school game. Let me explain that a bit more: Gameplay elements seems a bit obsolete and not implemented well enough. One of the most obvious ones would be the height attack, for some reason my men wasn’t able to do height attacks but enemy were able to attack from above without any problems. Other than that, there are lots of enemies clumped together and combat is pretty dull with the requirement of micromanagement. Since there are lots of encounters and some of the enemies are much stronger than the other ones, while having no indications, you have to do it by trial and error with a lot of backtracking. However, worst part is the enemies’ unlimited spells. I died a lot of time, because of AoE chain ccs. Sadly, even though there are a lot of spells and classes, spells do not feel very different or for some parts useful. Since there is a spell limit per rest for some reason, the combat feels much worse and more like a chore. Plus, the loot from combat is abysmal, experience is minimal. So, there is no real reason to fight. There are some boss fights with dragons for some reason. Even with their huge stats, they have mobs around for you to fight with the dragon and the mob at the same time. Guess what you get, after killing them… Just a couple useless items. Another problem would be the money. I had lots of money at my playthrough, since there was nothing worth buying other than the free DLC content. Weirdly, most of the binded weapons are mediocre. I think they were added to the game and you have to achieve some things to strengthen your weapon but a lot of them are not worth it. Therefore, realising this, after putting some time into it is annoying. Another weird decision is the enchanting system. There is no disenchantment option or getting back the rare ingredients. If this was a 20 years old game, it would not be problem but it is a problem for a modern game. Caed Nua would be another point for being obsolete. Although, Caed Nua management is an interesting system at his core, it feels like it is half-done, especially with the constant bandit raids. It is very tiny and almost have no real impact. Putting the unbalanced difficulty (with weird spikes) with a lot of RNG and no rewards to the mixture makes the gameplay even worse. Lastly, some quests are not explained after development or not updated properly and you get confused, especially if you are playing it time to time. Second most important thing would be the bugs. If you pick two people from the party and try to move them, they cannot go to the place you have clicked for some reason and it seems like they did not care about it at all. Other problems I have encountered are broken interfaces, characters that go invisible (enemies can see them though), until the end of the combat; bugged books that vanishes (I was making a library and tracking the books that I read), bugged audio, weird book font which can change into another font at the same book. Unfortunately, I did encounter all of these bugs during my playthrough over and over again. The third and last thing that I did not like about the game was the writing-story. First of all, contributor stories are the one of the most idiotic elements I have ever seen. There are lots of them, they do not add anything to the story, break the atmosphere by pushing you afar and it is poorly written, while being too short to be interesting and too long to be curious. Apart from that, there are lots to read about the world and the lore; the main idea of reading souls is interesting. However, writing (like an amateur writer from Wattpad), pace, some of the events not being believable, while being contradicting to some other events (no one cares about the things that happened, characters do not care about anything around them other than stealing), weird and pretentious vocabulary decisions, bland and forced narrative style with boring, ever-talking characters that you do not care (also you start to not care about the story very quickly) with the choices that has no real impact on game are making this game a chore. Also, there are a lot of skills and choices at the beginning which overwhelms the player. DLCs make the game a bit better but definitely it is not enough."
Pillars of Eternity,RPG,Can't wait for deadfire
Pillars of Eternity,RPG,"Finally a long awaited FRP/RPG, hardcore, oldschool and awesome down to the last detail. A fitting descendant to the legends like Baldurs Gate or Icewind Dale..."
The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-earth,"Adventure, RPG, Strategy",Companion app for the Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle Earth board game. The board game is worth the price of admission and the app ensures consistent replayability.
Rusty Lake Hotel,"Adventure, Indie","The game is very short.  I completed it 100% in 1.7 hours according to Steam.  That being said, it is also very cheap, and so I will recommend it.  After all it's worth sending some coins to the people who brought us such wonderful free games in the same universe.  This game has some beautiful art and some nice story telling techniques.  The pheasant and the rabbit are particularly memorable."
Sorcery! Parts 1 and 2,"Adventure, Indie, RPG","This is kind of a weak recommendation.  This is a solo RPG that has been ported to the computer.  The company that has done it has really done a good job in doing so, which is why I still recommend it even though it is rather over-priced.  Like the book it is based on the game is really short.  You can finish it in one sitting and perhaps see as much of it as you'd like in two or three playthroughs.  Between that, and the fact that the superior Lone Wolf books are available for free and that the world of Sorcery is sadly generic, I would only recommend buying this if it is on a pretty good sale. The best part of the game is what the Inkle has added, the combat system.  Here you pick a strength of attack based on what you think your opponent might do next.  Your opponent has tells written into the text descriptions of the fights that you can use choose the best course of action.  Usually, you want your hits to be just slightly stronger than your opponent's.  And if you can't beat your opponent, you must defend.  It all comes together beautifully, and is much more fun than throwing the dice. The other part I quite like about the game is that you can role play a bit.  Perhaps this is the trade off for the world itself not seeming particularly real, as it leaves the writing a lot terser than Lone Wolf (I compare this to it so often because I had several of these series as a kid and found Lone Wolf to be the most memorable).  In Sorcery!, you are given quite a few more options than what direction to travel and whether to help someone or kill them.  It's what makes you want to play through the game more than once to see what another choice may bring. The worst part of the game is probably how you cast spells.  I wish the game would just supply me with a list of spells I might want to cast, rather than have me spell them out.  It takes a lot of flipping back and forth to the spell book, which isn't even particularly easy to access.  Often I take the warrior path because it's more fun, which shouldn't be the case in a game called Sorcery!"
Sorcery! Parts 1 and 2,"Adventure, Indie, RPG","Game has absolutely no redeeming qualities.Combat is retarded, spell casting is annoying, there is very little to work with on events to predict good or bad things.There is also no voice acting.Even the gambling is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ retarded, they couldn't come up with a better dice game??Game is maybe $3, not $12."
Destiny 2,"Action, Adventure, Free To Play",I used to play this game religiously back on the ps4 (Destiny 1) so once i started playing D2 i really enjoyed it untill they started blatantly ripping their entire playerbase off by simply taking out the entire story content AND DLC'S you paid for! The game's dlc model is disgusting and full of greed. Big twitch streamer for this game pretty much dictates what gets nerfed as bungie only pay's attention to them instead of the community for pretty evident reasons. Also the dev's are pretty stingy and decided that they wouldn't enable Linux/proton support because they think its still the early 2000's with distro variability wich proton deals with.

Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy: The Telltale Series,Adventure,"The basic idea of this is that as captain of the ship you can't make everyone happy.  I think that's a good idea for the Telltale system, but for me, at least, it doesn't work for Guardians of the Galaxy.  It kinda makes the entire crew into fussy prima donnas who can't actually make any decisions for themselves, but sure know how to complain about how things end up going.   Also, the jokes tend not to land.  A bit of a surprise after finishing the hilarious Tales from the Borderlands, but looking it up, I guess this has different script writers.  With the fun atmosphere is lost, I kinda thought the Guardians should break up, actually.  Maybe Gamora and Drax can rejoin the Infinity Watch :P"

Dagon: by H. P. Lovecraft,"Adventure, Casual, Indie, Free To Play","Really enjoyed this.   I had recently read this story and it remained very faithful to the story.   I watched this in VR mode and it was really awesome.   Narration voice is perfect and professional quality.   Sound is amazing.   For a free experience and for those who like Lovecraft, this is a no-brainer.  Hope they put out more stuff!"
Dagon: by H. P. Lovecraft,"Adventure, Casual, Indie, Free To Play","I honestly like this way of visualizing the story. It's atmospheric, and considering a lot of people struggle with HPL's writing on the page, this style might just be the trick to getting folks to actually diving into the stories as they are. The trivia bits are a great touch, too. I love that the team has obviously spent time researching HPL's life and literature, and references other third party literature on him. Lovecraft, in my opinion, gets a really bad reputation in the modern times because of how much of his writing and themes get taken out of context - or not even that, just how ignorant most people today are of the state of the times when he told his stories. His body of work spans decades, and many changes can be observed throughout, often related to changes in his personal life and environments. Having these trivia bits really helps giving the player an insight into the wider socio-political state of the world and the author's perspective. It's a great choice. I'd be confident in calling this game a ""Virtual Installation"", a term TotalBiscuit tried to coin way back in the day when games like Dear Esther and Gone Home were rising up. It's kind of like a guided museum tour - and in this case, I'm all for it. Illustrating these stories and conveying their atmosphere is one of the major points I look for in Mythos adaptations, and often, arbitrary gameplay loops just get in the way of the tension. It won't work for everyone - but that is to be expected. Hells, Lovecraft's stories don't work for everyone either. On the flipside, the short duration of the narrative should lend itself well towards catching the interest of new readers, without losing them halfway. Dagon is easily ""beatable"" (as silly as the term is in this instance) in under an hour, even at a leisurely pace. And since the title is free (as is the bulk of HPL's work; you can read most of his stories on Wikisource, for example), there's honestly no reason not to dive in. I will, however, present this caveat: You need to be in the right mindset to absorb the narrative and atmosphere. Rushing through it, or outside distractions, might take you out of the experience. Make sure to set aside a quiet hour, preferably in the evening or night when things quiet down outside, put on some headphones and lean back in your chair. Best to also turn off any secondary displays. Tunnel-vision on the experience for the greatest mileage, and maybe put aside the Trivia achievement hunt for a second playthrough, so as not to interrupt the story's flow too much by way of searching the environment. Either way, though, I'm glad Dagon exists in this format, and hope the developers will find a worthwhile niche in this style of narrative experience - I'd certainly love to see more of this!"
Morphopolis,"Adventure, Casual, Indie","Your bug moves so very slowly across the screenn and you have to keep the left mouse button held down the entire time.  Besides that, most of the game is just finding hidden objects.  There is only one puzzle that requires any thought at all and it is the very last puzzle of the game.  The good parts are the hand drawn backgrounds and that one puzzle at the end, and I don't think they outweigh the annoyance of the controls."
eversion,Indie,"Interesting game... but way too short for what it is. It is basically a platformer with some basic puzzle elements and a weird twisting theme on top. Neat idea, until you realize that the platforming is pretty clunky and the puzzles are almost non-existent. You can finish everything, including all achievements, in about 2 hours. I'd recommend it if the game was a dollar, but unless you get it on sale for under $2 I wouldn't recommend it."
eversion,Indie,"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn Honestly, I think the way the game quotes Lovecraft before the game even starts is a bit of a spoiler, because you'll know what to expect if you know what that name means. It's like seeing Urobuchi's name attached to literally anything. You know it's going to be dark and f*cked up and lots of people are going to die, guaranteed."
Reventure,"Adventure, Indie","This reminds me a bit of the old Kongregate flash games.  I suppose it's in the puzzle platformer category.  And I suspect several hours in, the puzzles might get hard once you've done all the easy ones.  But as it is, it's kind of tedious.  You have to replay the first few screens over and over and over again looking for new ways to die.  That's basically what the puzzle is, you have to find ending in the game.  Most of them are ways to die, but there are a few others.  There are several different ways you can deal with a dragon, for instance.  I do kind of like it, and the enjoy the humor and slight changes in the world you start noticing as some things you do make permanent changes, but then you find a new ending screen, and it fades away, and fades back on that same start screen and you express a little sigh."
Reventure,"Adventure, Indie","Reventure is a different game, it's a lot of fun, I burst laughing with a lot of the endings or the dialogue, it's definitely a unique game. But I won't kill all that cats for the 101 ending, sorry devs."
Cardboard Town,"Casual, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",+Aesthetics +Gameplay is elegant +Functional UX/UI -Plays like a puzzle
Cardboard Town,"Casual, Indie, Simulation, Strategy","Build your deck to build a city. Fun and engaging with interesting mechanics that force you to make choices about what cards to pick and how to place your buildings. Pretty chill except the final victory quest which goes a bit too hard imo, throwing multiple disasters at you back to back to back. Great replay value but that rough finish is a limiting factor."
Cardboard Town,"Casual, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Its absolutely addictve !!! It's basically a deck building type board game which I love in general.
Shards of Azuria,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG","Gameplay is okay, but not good. Annoying crash when changing zones, and a bug that broke my main quest made me quit. Skip this one. Sometimes my game would crash when leaving the main town. Usually that could be fixed by positioning myself differently when leaving. When entering the dungeon from the surface, my game crashed about 80% of the time, to the point where I felt like I shouldn't leave. Super frustrating. The main quest did not recognize that I had opened the first dungeon door even though I followed the quest instructions exactly, and thus I could not continue with the rest of the quest. At that point it was no longer worth continuing to play. The game systems were generally ok but felt slow. Combat was fine against small groups but the game insisted on throwing big groups at me, which became quite tedious. Mining felt slower than it needed to be, same with walk speed. There was a little bit of progression in a very limited set of quests, loot, and abilities that was enjoyable but not exciting. I would have tentatively recommended the game if not for the crashes and the unforgivable broken main quest. I leave this game wishing I could get the time back that I spent playing it. Strongly recommend you skip it."

Halls of Torment,"Action, Indie, RPG","MORTAL! I HAVE A CHALLENGE FOR YOU! Attempt to reach a higher play time to achievement-ratio than I have in the game! To follow the same path I've taken, you need to: - Avoid any guides of the game - No cheating - obviously - No aborted runs, meaning you finish the run / push it as far as possible even if you had a certain achievement unlocked the run --- THE REVIEW --- Vampire Survivors meet Diablo = <3 +Fantastic twist to Vampire Survivors; more active game play where aiming plays role as well +Lots to unlock and progress through - like Vampire Survivors; roguelite-progress is gated behind achievements, but there are some progress (torment shards + artifacts) that exist beyond those +Player choice: skills, gear (actual builds!), level up stats +Great ideas; eg. sending gear to surface, potions (e.g. rerolls, banish, lock, double) -Some of the roguelite-progression achievements aren't fun to complete"
Halls of Torment,"Action, Indie, RPG",Really good entry in the Vampire Survivors genre. Classes have different playstyles and the unlock system for gear and potions is fun.
Halls of Torment,"Action, Indie, RPG",Vampire Survivors + Diablo 2. Good-looking pixel art and tight gameplay mechanics. A lot of little details that show me that the devs are true fans of both genres and styles of game. Fantastic in its own right. Active devs with thought-out changes and improvements (so far!) Strong recommend.
Halls of Torment,"Action, Indie, RPG",A fun Bullet Heaven in the style of Diablo 1.
Halls of Torment,"Action, Indie, RPG",Slow to start but ending up really enjoying it.. Would play much more except other games are calling.
Predynastic Egypt,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy","Surprisingly hard and addictive. I definitely would want a Roman, Viking etc version."
Predynastic Egypt,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy","I was surprised by this efficiency puzzle 4X (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate). It's true what they say: the best solo games are efficiency puzzles. A mellowing 50-something artistic realist, I enjoy this sensory experience: it's a pleasant blend of sights and sounds; audio is animal and rain sounds and village life, and visuals are stylized Egyptian art and hieroglyphics. Nothing alarming, stressful or violent. Entertaining history lesson for a lazy Sunday afternoon. The theme of Egyptian mythology reminds me of Spirit Island, King of Dragon Pass, Against the Storm and Terra Mystica. Religion plays an important part in the fate of your tribe, as it has throughout history. Worker-placement mechanics are kept fresh by a changing map as you scout and build, trade and raid. As it says, ""bold plans and fierce might"" are indeed needed to actually achieve the ever-expanding goals to victory. My first game I was having fun ""treading water"" and the game allows you to do that, before announcing finally that I had lost and was as ""wise as a baby!"" So of course I had to play again, and was itching to pass one of the 7 or 8 trials this time, which I finally did, but it was a challenge! I had to pay more attention, actually learn some of the history and religion, and then prioritize accordingly. It's light strategy, not deep, but still good ""work for brain"", and mine needs work, that's for sure. It took me about 7 hours to play through Predynastic Egypt. It was engaging the whole time! Like one of those Civ games: ""Just one more turn!"""
The Swords of Ditto: Mormo's Curse,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG","Unfortunately I can't really recommend this game. The core combat is so boring that I couldn't bring myself to keep going after the first playthrough. The toys are fun but the energy system means that you only get a few uses before a very long recharge. And the lack of toy usage makes enemies feel very samey, just bonk bonk dodge ad infinitum. The randomization of the world does nothing to make the game more interesting, because it's one static layout per long playthrough. Also it means you waste a lot of time walking around trying to find things since you can't look up where anything actually is. This is a game where if I could go back, I would tell myself to not bother playing it."
Nova Blitz,"Action, Free To Play, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, Strategy","Not worth your time. The game is also dead. No players at all. Check Fable Fortune for an ""adult Hearthstone"" instead."
Mythgard,"Casual, Free To Play, Indie, Strategy","This game solved the problem of not drawing land in magic by having you destroy your hand each turn......which leads to you burning out real fast and topdecking like you are in a hearthstone tournament watching a tank warrior vs another tank warrior. The worst part, is that as soon as your opponent top decks something good and you don't you are pretty much dead. This is especially true of the Draft Arena mode.....in which they make even worse by having you draft potentially more trash into your deck every couple of losses instead of thinning it out. IE: If my deck's problem is card draw......I don't need to be adding more non-draw minions to the deck.  And if I do get those minions/spells to draw......I need to get rid of garbage, otherwise the impact is minimal. Has the price tag of MTG, with the frustration of feeling helpless you get in Hearthstone - where you are at the mercy of your draw and games flip to autowin real fast."
Mythgard,"Casual, Free To Play, Indie, Strategy",Next patch suggestion: add players !
D&D Lords of Waterdeep,Strategy,I'm addicted to this game. It's one of the board games that got me into board gaming and I still enjoy the game today.
D&D Lords of Waterdeep,Strategy,I purchased this game to play with friends. I have played many games of the board game version of Waterdeep. I can say that this is a very accurate adaptation of the game. It is nice that the AI keeps track of all your resources and plot quest effects. I have only played on-line with friends so I can not offer an opinion on the asychronous play. The graphics are nice and clear and the cards are easy to read since you can zoom into any space or card by just clicking on it. The AI also keeps a running total of your Victory Points so you always know where you are in point standing. I have thoroughly wnjoyed the games I have played and I am sure I will enjoy many more.
D&D Lords of Waterdeep,Strategy,"""Oldie, but goodie"" Euro-style boardgame with cubes! Classic D&D theme, but a little thin. Buildings, quests, palace intrigue. Core mechanics are resource management and worker-placement. Imagination required! (in the spirit of the pencil and paper game!) You'll get out of this one what you put into it! Bug-free!"
D&D Lords of Waterdeep,Strategy,"I've never played the original boardgame before but this game is a real treat. Build on very solid mechanics, offering multiple strategies, very pretty (or should I say ""elegant"") and music is pleasant too. Each game is totally different due to randomised lords, buildings and quests. Port is almost flawless, great UI, well done tutorial. I've encountered only one bug during 8 games (some of the intrigue cards stuck in my inventory and I couldn't play them). AI opponents are competent at highest level so winning requires careful play (especially in one on one games), but it's never punishing or unfair. I would love to see more boardgames ports from this dev."

XCOM: Enemy Unknown,Strategy,"Pros: 1) Engaging gameplay (immensly tense yet highly addictive), and high replayability 2) Awesome OST (Expect no less from Michael McCann) 3) Storyline is nice as well, especially earliest of the game Cons: 1) Erm...your soldiers are byproduct of the clonetroopers (expect to be frustated with misses shots) 2) Several performance issues including the infamous berserker lag issue 3) Limited customization (Soldiers) This game...really gets me. It is been a while since I have been overwhelmingly engaged with strategic, turn-based game after StarCraft 2 (though not the exact RTS in definition). Everything is awesome in this game (minus RNG), and I am glad to bought this game during sale recently. Last but not least, it's XCOM baby!"

XCOM: Enemy Unknown,Strategy,"I like the level of detail and micromanagement you can put into your super trooper team.

Atlas Reactor,"Free To Play, Strategy","Maybe with the new engines and some new techniques of nowadays they could bring something like this back, I did enjoy it. Was a good concept just lack of players."
Gone Home,"Adventure, Indie","One of the most detailed games I have ever played. The game design includes all unnecessary objects which gives depth to the game like coaster, mark of cups, board games, cartridges; you can inspect all of the items in the game even if they do not make you progress. Plus there are references which makes you smile and sometimes you can understand some elements of the game comes from the developers' lifes. You discover what happened at the house and read/listen a brilliant story. Game was really scary for me actually and I think developers made a great job about that with this simplicity. Last of all, I enjoyed developers' commentary and I recommend it to everyone."
Gone Home,"Adventure, Indie","Meh, this isnt even a game, you just walk around the house reading to uninteresting stuff about this girls life. Dont waste money."
Gone Home,"Adventure, Indie","Why is the Super Nintendo in Sam's room in the trailer but not in the game? So, I kinda knew I wouldn't like this because the store page said it was an adventure game with no puzzles.  But I decided to buy it in the pack with Tacoma which I was more interested in.   I was right.  I don't like it.  And it's because it's just not enough.  A story is more than characters, in my opinion.  And some things just don't make a lot of sense.  Like why is the fort still set up in the living room?  Does no one in this house clean?  And some red herrings would have actually made a more interesting plot than what was delivered.  The parents' room being a mess, for instance.  I thought, perhaps there has been a break in?  or the business with the possible ghost.  But apparently the makers of the game agree with the sentiments of the grandfather in the nasty letter to his son that was discovered in the basement:  that authors today cloud up their work with too much plot and it should just be about people.  Well, in my opinion it just has to be about things happening to the people.  Here's hoping I like Tacoma better."

Mafia III: Definitive Edition,"Action, Adventure",DONT EVER BUY THIS. -boring gameplay -bad gun dynamics -ported sh**ty graphics
Mafia III: Definitive Edition,"Action, Adventure","Back when I played Mafia 3 I really felt mixed on the whole experience. Sure, its a game with an incredibly violent story that's perfectly told but even then that's not enough for me to give it a positive review. I will sing some praises for it's depiction of the 60s and the powder keg era that it was but besides that the game is painfully ""mid"" as the kids would say nowadays. Even for a game that now has the sub-title of ""definitive edition"" there's nothing that really feels definitive outside of the inclusion of all the DLC which to be fair add a lot of nice features that I feel should have already been present in the base game, but even with these you have a game that both looks and feels outdated, and again I did find some joy while playing this but the joy I felt was THE bare minimum. Hangar 13 is definitely a talented studio and they proved that several times over but I just don't know what it is about Mafia 3 that rubs me the wrong way."
Marvel's Midnight Suns,"RPG, Strategy","Marvel's Midnight Suns is a fun game. I really like the deck building combats. Reviews that have portrayed it as a kind of ""X-Com with superheroes"" are wrong. It's more like ""Fights in Tight Spaces with superheroes"".  In that sense, I recommend it. The loop of getting better cards after each mission is pretty well done. The heroes themselves play differently enough and have enough unique strategy to them that it makes it interesting to put together teams. The selection of enemies could be broader, but it is not so much worse than, say, Fights in Tight Spaces, and that go me through 107 hours. EDIT: I spoke too soon about variety of enemies, there is at least one point in the game where the variety increases substantially. It is, however, layered over with all of this extra graphics stuff, none of which adds much of anything to the game, really. I mean, some of the dialogue and story stuff is fun; I really like Magik and Spider-man's bits. And playing paper dolls with superheroes is momentary pleasant diversion. But so much effort was put into a game that, honestly, would have been just as good if not better in a full ""Darkest Dungeon"" interface, with well done cell animation and no 3d effects at all.  The fight scenes are ok. There are some bits that are really fun the first 20 times you see them, and then you are like ""right, I get it, Deadpool gives me a thumbs up sign when the explosion happens behind him, hahah"". None of this extra graphics layer is so well done, none of it has such good art direction, that it seems worth the effort expended on it.  I say this as a very die-hard Marvel comics fan since like 1979. It's good to see these characters done in a game like this, its almost a dream come true, but at the same time, meh to a lot of their art direction choices. I do recommend it, but maybe not at full price, because you are paying for a lot of bling that ain't that bling-y."
Marvel's Midnight Suns,"RPG, Strategy","While the Abbey aspects are often cheesy and I can see making replays very tedious, all aspects directly related to building your characters up and the card combat are quite fun!"
Imperator: Rome,"Simulation, Strategy","I am really enjoying Imperator: Rome, as I did EU4. One of the complaints that annoys me is the idea that Paradox has delivered a very bare bones game or didn't try hard enough in fleshing out the systems. So, let's compare it to EU4 v1.0 at launch in terms of features (not considering quality, both great games at launch in my view). Since I will be going off memory (and not verifying every point) there will probably be instances where I forget something that was in EU4 v1.0 at launch, or give it credit for something that was not in at launch, so anyone feel free to correct me. Artwork - IR clear win EU4 v1.0 artwork consisted of loading screen images, iconographics, details on the map, unit graphics, event images, and flags. IR contains all of these, and it is my impression that it has more of each. Furthermore, IR has a character face generator with a number of cultural sets (more than CK2 at launch for sure) and puts wonders on the map which is really nice. Map - IR clear win The graphics of the map have not only improved, it is clear that alot of care has been put into it. The way that the terrain map mode uses country colours at different zoom levels finally allows us to enjoy the beauty of the terrain whilst maintaining the political context of the political map mode (an idea first used in HOI4), and couple it with all of the other bells and whistles eclipses all other strategy game maps that I have ever seen. This is not only something that you should expect with the passing of time, the IR map is not the EU4 1.0 map with sharper edges and more bump maps, I imagine it would have taken a significant amount of additional development time to craft a map this good. Events - Tie? This is inevitably going to be subjective. EU4 v1.0 had quite a good range of generic events, and also had specific country events and events tied to circumstances. From my playtime in IR it has a roughly equivalent amount, but as with EU4 v1.0 it will depend on which country you pick. Full disclaimer I have the deluxe edition fluff pack, not sure how much that added. Government systems - IR clear win EU4 v1.0 featured monarchies and republics (afaik the tribal federation stuff came in with a DLC?), where republics were just like monarchies except you picked your candidate every few years and legitimacy was replaced with republican tradition. IR has three government types that are all more different from one another than the two EU4 v1.0 government types. Characters - IR wins by default EU4 any version does not feature characters. While the IR system does not contain as much depth as CK2 (whether at 1.0 or now) it still adds a lot to the experience. Your ruler is now a person, not three numbers listed next to a randomly generated name. Heirs are now more interesting, generals are both your conquerors and potential future threats. You can play IR without getting into the character system very much, and I imagine many reviews are based on playtime like this, but there is alot there to dig into. Armies - IR clear win EU4 v1.0 features three troop types. One does not appear till mid-game (cannons), and one becomes almost irrelevant mid to late game (horses). Troop types got buffed with technology, and country groups had different stats for each type. IR has much more than three, and each have significant pluses and drawbacks, not only to their combat performance but their speed and implications for supply. Moreover, with strategic resources (like seen in 4x strategy games) and military traditions your army composition will often differ significantly across plays. Clear win to IR here. Technoloy - IR win In EU4 v1.0 techs were constant across all countries, except some researched faster than others. This is true in IR as well, except now there are inventions which give you alot of interesting choices throughout the game. There’s also alot of flavour text attached to these inventions. EU4 1.0 tech advances did feel more significant as it opened up new parts of the game (new buildings, cannons) but the inventions system on the top of IR gives it the win to me. Population management - IR clear win EU4 1.0 abstracted population into homogeneous entities within each province. IR has a much richer simulation of population where each has an attached culture and religion, and they can move around or be promoted. The IR pop system could stand to be fleshed out further and made more interesting, but it’s clearly vastly more fleshed out to what EU4 offered at 1.0. Colonisation - Tie Both games featured colonisation in fairly bare bones form. It only became interesting in EU4 with the first expansion. I guess IR might win this one because it has migratory tribes (which EU4 lacked until a later expansion), but EU4 did have some events tied to your colonies so tie. Diplomacy - EU4 slight win This is a tough one because it’s hard to remember what was in EU4 at 1.0 and what was added later. It did, however, definitely have diplomats, royal marriages, personal unions, and inheritances. IR has multiple vassal types (which EU4 lacked until later) and character interactions which is great too. Interface - IR clear win The EU4 1.0 interface might have had less ‘where do I find X?’ instances when playing but that’s only because there was less to click and look into. IR also has a number of essential UI features that were only added to EU4 over the years like the macro builder. EU4 1.0 was micro heavy with the clicking, and lacked alot of the automation features that is in IR. Country Customisation - tie EU4 v1.0 featured sets of ideas and you could pick groups (which were opened by techs) and were constant across countries. IR has a smaller version of these ideas, but also features laws (which EU4 does not have) and also military traditions which has three branches. I think the combination of these three match idea groups. Country-specific flavour - tie Other than events, EU4 v1.0 featured idea sets for either major countries or country groups that were unlocked as you progress through ideas. There was no real choice for these, and other than flavour text that was it. IR features different military tradition branches for each country group, so while there’s less of them they also branch and have more artwork attached. So tie? Naval combat - EU4 win Got to give it to EU4 here, as it had multiple ship types. Trade - IR slight win Trade in EU4 was a big mechanic and involved using ships and sending merchants to increase trade power and push trade flows, it was pretty great even at launch. Trade in IR is very different, involving a large array of resources and setting up trade routes to chain bonuses together which interacts with pops and your military. It feels alot more like Victoria than EU4. It might come down to individual preference which is a more fun mechanic, but you can’t say IR is not as fleshed out in this area (particularly before EU4 got all of the extra additions to Trade that came in the later DLCs). Is there anything else we can compare them on? Anyway, the whole point of this was just to make an argument for why it’s silly to say that Paradox gave us a bare bones game. It is clear they have put more resources into making this game than it’s closest predecessor. There are alot of mechanics and moving parts in IR, it’s a more complex game than EU4. Where it needs to go from here is first to balance and improve on some of these parts to make a more compelling whole."
Imperator: Rome,"Simulation, Strategy",How do I play this game
Imperator: Rome,"Simulation, Strategy","It is really hard to figure out why I would gladly put hundreds upon hundreds of hours into multiple other Paradox games, and yet stare blankly at Imperator: Rome for 74 minutes and then just give up and walk away.  Is this how all those people who don't ""get"" Crusader Kings 2 feel?  Maybe? But if I had to come up with an explanation, I guess there are two reasons: 1) Ancient Rome leaves me cold as a setting.  I'm just not interested in it. 2) The mechanics and interface seem to detailed and cryptic.  This is laughable in that I've heard the exact same criticism of other Paradox games that I took to immediately and felt were natural (e.g. CK2, HoI 4). I have to say I can't recommend the game, but that's the best explanation I can come up for as to why, and honestly its not very satsifying."
Imperator: Rome,"Simulation, Strategy",Very nice enhancement of the franchise.
Imperator: Rome,"Simulation, Strategy","Why am I able to write a review without owning the game? I don't own the product and I did NOT receive this for free, unlike Steam claims! 😁"
Magicka,"Action, RPG","Accidentally murdering your friends in hilarious ways only to bring them back to life so you can accidentally murder them again: the videogame. Oh and there's also a spell that randomly murders any single character on screen. Including yourself. Playing it solo and you accidentally delete yourself? Too bad, game over."
Magicka,"Action, RPG","Pretty fun game with original mechanics and humorous writing. Even though this game has a co-op feature, it is still fun playing solo without being too hard (contrary to Magicka 2). There is an adventure mode (campaign) which I love, with a reasonable play time and some challenges for constant killing. Originality of the game is making the spells and magicks. You need to combine certain elements for certain spells and magicks and variety of the magicks is wide while spell variety is good. Although I do not like the DLCs, you can buy them with bundle for additional robes, challenges and side adventures. They have a decent price with bundle, especially at sales. Beware of the constant crashes though (at least once in half an hour)"
Magicka,"Action, RPG","Game constantly crashes to desktop, the multiplayer is very hard to set up, go for Magicka 2 it's way more streamlined."
Orwell: Keeping an Eye On You,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation","This is quite an original game, if you know SPYCRAFT you are going to want to play this, it's simpler than SC but it's still a long awaited game for me at least. Though I must warn, it can really get boring after a while since what you do is quite simple and you have little effect on outcomes."
Orwell: Keeping an Eye On You,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation",Brillant dystopian game with many endings. Game makes you monitor people's personal life and give judgements about them. While playing this game you had no choice to think about the morality of your choices and concept of the big brother society.
Orwell: Keeping an Eye On You,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation",Wow! This game is fantastic. Can't wait for season 2.
Griftlands,Indie,"This is a wonderful game. Beautifully presented. I've not yet played the second character's story yet, but I look forward to it. Maybe this weekend... Another great KLEI game. The diplomacy fight system is cool and new. In my 9 hours I've not really scratched the surface of this game and still have modes that I have yet to explore. Highly recommended!"
Griftlands,Indie,Nope
Griftlands,Indie,"Well, there's an interesting deck builder game! And even with forgiving ""story mode"" difficulty, for the lamer ones of us!"
Griftlands,Indie,"While on the surface it likely looks like yet another Slay the Spire clone, it's actually much more.  Some of the cool unique bits: -Each encounter you clear in the game will have long term relational consequences.  By your actions in the world you'll be making friends and enemies that can easily have repercussions later in the game. -You'll be building up both Battle and a Negotiation decks, essentially your physical and persuasion decks, that both have totally unique mechanics to them."
Griftlands,Indie,Highly recommend. Brilliant characters with witty and distinctive writing and beautiful art clash words and blades and bullets across a decadent world of slugmen and mutated beasts and fish-crusaders. Character development in the form of deckbuilding and relationship building. I got 40 extremely entertaining hours out of it (multiple playthroughs). Cool!
Aegis Defenders,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy","Good concept but frustrating execution of the defense levels makes this not worth playing. It's a platformer with puzzle and tower defense sections. The platforming was standard run and jump fare. The puzzle sections were fine, not interesting but short. The defense sections were just bad. Combat spawned too much stuff all over the place with no good way of covering the ground. Building required you to run and jump all over to gather resources to build your defenses while under a timer which was just not fun at all. Since the defense sections are the meat of the game, it wasn't worth continuing. Other reviews say it is too hard solo and co-op may be better, but I played it co-op. Since each character can only build one type of thing, and one character is useless in combat, playing co-op does not significantly improve the experience. In fact I thought it was more designed to be played solo since it would make more sense to have both characters together to build both types of defense in one spot and to build combo buildings, and you would be able to fight and repair at the same time. A game that does a couple things okay but the main focus is poorly implemented and doesn't work well solo or co-op. You can skip this one."
Saints Row: The Third,Action,This is one of the best game for the people who love open world game one of the classics of saints row series and also one of the best developed by violation
Saints Row: The Third,Action,"Saints Row the best one. Nothing about this game is realistic. And everything about that just feels right. --What is it?-- A third person story, action game. Able to drive any and all vehicles, cars, airplanes, motorbikes and.. spaceships. With you as the leader a fearless, the coolest, most admired badass effortlessly leading your group with a goofy charisma and friendly charm only ever seen from the coolest kid in school that all the boys want to be, and all the girls want to be with. I don't usually watch cutscenes and skip them in other games as it's generally just, go here and do that with emotionless puppets. Not here. They have a well thought out scenario for each mission that has very detailed character animations dramatically putting it all into perspective and setting it up for the hilarity and or general chaos that you are about to be exposed to. There is a detailed character creation system model for male or female that rivals that of Cyberpunk 2077. Tweaking all kinds of things that makes us unique, you can set your weight and muscular build. A variety of clothes to choose from to decorate ourselves with even further. You can even get tattoos. They managed to bottle fun. From friends having a good time, singing and laughing along with music while driving. The really goofy animations, that are intended to be over the top, funny and parodies of human society in general. Not taking itself too serious, while giving you options for difficulty, it's handing you mostly everything on a silver platter without the need to grind, also giving you a lot of freedom to enjoy all the game has to offer and unlock stronger abilities as you go. And yet there can still be a challenge in that, depending on how much you bite off at a time. It's aging extremely well. It still looks fantastic, and runs really well even on my modest system playing in 4K."
Saints Row: The Third,Action,"Fun, ridiculous gameplay and story. Co-op the entire game with a friend for a great time. Solo: 7/10 Co-op: 8/10"

Saints Row: The Third,Action,Its like some weird ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fever dream and im not sure if i like it or not.
Saints Row: The Third,Action,its alright i guess
Saints Row: The Third,Action,"While this game is very fun, still looks great for how old it is, and has a lot of customization, it suffers from crashing a lot. It sucks when you're near the end of a mission and the game crashes for no reason. If you can deal with the crashing then get this game, but if you don't wan to deal with it, just avoid this."
Sleeping Dogs,"Action, Adventure","♥♥♥♥ YOU GWAILO Oh wait, wrong game. FRIENDLY ADVICE,  HK DRIVES ON THE LEFT. THE PEDESTRIANS WILL THANK YOU LATER"
Vampire: The Masquerade - Coteries of New York,Indie,"Beautiful art, cool storyline, great music all destroyed by a forced streamlined ending. It would be a great game but ultimately nothing you do affects the story or the outcome (so what's the point?). Operation Wolf felt less on the rails than this one."
Escape the Backrooms,"Indie, Early Access",very fun especially when you hear your friends screaming their lungs out while they are chased and jumpscared.
Escape the Backrooms,"Indie, Early Access",The few matches i've played were full of kids trying to speedrun the game while most of us tried to catch up. This is on the same level as FNAF horror. The only fear you may experience.. its the fear of nearing the steam refund time window (2h)
ENDLESS™ Legend,"RPG, Strategy",Excellent 4X game with an interesting weird fantasy setting.
ENDLESS™ Legend,"RPG, Strategy","Endless Legend is perhaps the best Civ-like game I've played.  Mostly because of the gorgeous environments, the interesting races, and the multitude of things to discover.  The races play extremely differently from one another, which gives the game far more replayabilty than Civ in which the differences are so minor that you would do fine even if you didn't look up your race's special ability.  Also, there is more of a focus on adventuring, kind of like Age of Wonders, so you are never left just clicking end turn over and over again while you wait for your human opponents to wage interminably long wars.  Finally city management is more interesting with it allowing you to put your citizens to work in different ways. My only complaint is the wonky combat system which makes perhaps too many choices for you, but it is interesting too, I think of myself as more of a general while my troops do what they think is best. Some additional thoughts: I'd like to update my review because for the first time I played through the game all the way to the end on the largest map size and I have some additional thoughts.  Before, I've only won the game on small maps against few opponents.  This is because once you take out one or two other empires, no one can stand up to you any more.  This is true about a lot of 4X games. And maybe it's part of why I have traditionally preferred smaller, scenario based 4X's like Heroes of Might and Magic, Disciples, and Age of Wonders, to these sprawling history of the world things like this and Civilization.  The rewards for defeating an enemy in these games are too vast.  In the real world, the war effort depletes the resources of both sides, in these games, the winner gets brand new fully built up cities in addition to eliminating an enemy that might have previously been putting pressure on him.  There must be a better way to do this in these games.  Crusader Kings has a lot of interesting ways to keep the player from dominating the globe.  Principally, when your ruler dies, depending on your government-type, everything gets divvied up, or at the very least, the new ruler starts off with a lot lower favorablilty among his nobles than the old guy.  I don't know if similar things would work for Endless Legend or Civ, since you don't have people underneath of you in these games.  (although there are some interesting government and political ideas explored in Endless Space 2, which is trending in the right direction) Other than the overall challenge as the game progressed, there were some nice ideas in the later game.  Quest rewards increased at about the proper rate to always make them about the same amount worth doing.  They would give you rarer resources or even heroes or super powered artifacts.  In many ways the quests are a big part of what makes Endless Legend interesting from turn to turn, in comparison to Civ, where I feel like a lot of the game is just waiting for this or that to get done.  There are too many quests, however,  which makes them blur together.  Whereas I think Amplitude has mostly improved between Legend and Space 2, I think the quests are better in this game.  I that game there are also too many quests filling up your queue, but the rewards aren't really enough to make pursuing them worthwhile, and, since there aren't cool artifacts as in this game, you don't have any momento of the quests, which would allow you to think, I earned this from helping that minor faction. Well, I still highly recommend the game, even if I definitely do not recommend finishing it.  The real star of the game is the incredible variety of the factions which makes playing as each a unique game all in one box.  But I think you should only play them until you can see that there's no way you could lose and then go on to the next. As a final note, I've come down on the side of liking the combat system.  It helps to speed things up and I kind of like that not all the power is in my hands at that level, because in what game is the tactical combat AI good enough to stand up to human players?  That your troops seem to make some choices for themselves helps to level the playing field."
ENDLESS™ Legend,"RPG, Strategy","One of my favorite 4X strategy games that keeps luring me back to play, of course Civilization is awesome but this is a good alternative."
ENDLESS™ Legend,"RPG, Strategy","The combat in this game and unit movement are some of the dumbest ♥♥♥♥ I've ever seen done. I don't understand how something so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid gets implemented.  Its pretty much ""everyone goes at once, good luck guessing who is going to do what"" to the point where you just bring more to win rather than attempt to use good tactics. The race AI is terrible as well, they will literally attack you like opportunistic bastards, even if their entire motto is ""Peace"". I was literally told by a peace loving faction that I need to learn the value of peace through war, with no provocation other than they had some troops near a small undefended town and had a few more troops than I did....My mind is blown at the idiocy of this.  That IS NOT A JUSTIFICATION FOR ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ WAR.  I wasn't even sharing a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ border with them. The worse part is needed a resource to make diplomatic trades and declarations.....I literally couldn't kick someone out of my territory because I was 1 influence point short.....which is absolutely retarded. This game had a lot of potential but falls short on almost every aspect. It feels like half of the game was built, from only a handful of factions to a handful of minor factions to only 4 eras of research. Top it all off with unreasonable lag? No seriously....the game just randomly lags at random points and never stops stuttering.....on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nvidia 690 and 4 thousand dollar machine.  And it happens EVERY TIME. I literally can not give the game a second chance because it doesn't run smooth for more than a couple hours. This is at best a 5 dollar game, being paraded around by idiots that don't understand quality and are just fascinated at fantasy civilization. I can't recommend it, its extremely frustrating to play.  Just buy civ 5, 100% better."
ENDLESS™ Legend,"RPG, Strategy","You can play as a faction that makes people out of money and doesn't have to eat food, which i can relate to"
ENDLESS™ Legend,"RPG, Strategy",Le 4X nouvelle génération.
ENDLESS™ Legend,"RPG, Strategy","Having recently purchased Humankind, I figured I'd give these developers last big Civlike strategy game, this one, another spin.  I've always been a fan of the developers and recall liking this game but never getting much beyond the tutorial in the past.  While man of its unique mechanics took a bit to fully grasp, I really love how each race plays VERY differently with their own unique units, structures, techs, and inherit abilities (unlike Civilization, or even Humankind, in which the different cultures only mildly differentiate themselves from one another). You can really see a lot of the systems they'd later work into Humankind, and while not as slick looking as Humankind, it's nice to see a game fully refined by these developers whereas Humankind still has a lot of growing pains (bugs and balance issues) to be resolved before it reaches its full power."

Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor,Strategy,"This expansion consists three short campaigns: Tiger Ace, Causeway, Falaise Pocket. As you can guess, you are controlling a Tiger in Tiger Ace campaign. Weirdly, biggest threat for Tiger is grenade rifles and friendly AI is pretty bad. In Causeway, you play as a small part of the American paratroopers while missions in this campaign are lot more fun than British campaign (Maybe because they feel much stronger). In Falaise Pocket, you are trying to defend as Wehrmacht but this time, campaign offers you some original playstyle in these defence missions. Except Falaise Pocket, units in campaigns are very limited but strong. All of the campaigns add some new skills like direct attack, hide and revive. Plus, all of the command points are consecutive and feel like impactful. Each one of them differs as playstyle but unfortunately, each one of them only has one new map. Other than that, this DLC’s campaigns have a different style of cutscenes which isn't bad. Highly recommended to buy it with the bundle (You can play from base game without installing the expansions.)."

Resident Evil Village,Action,its pretty good
Resident Evil Village,Action,pog!!!
Resident Evil Village,Action,"the gameplay is much more refined and has a lot of depth, the village is great, the duke is lovely, and Ethan is more fleshed out this time. this game is much less scary than RE7 and mostly an action/survival, but it has a decent amount of enemy variety. despite the partially stupid writing, I liked the story and the ending but wished for something more. the graphics in some parts are trash while super realistic in others, and the cutscenes near the end feel like something out of a mobile game. performance wise, it's okay with some flickering and objects appearing-disappearing occasionally but nothing too bad."
Resident Evil Village,Action,glad to see Chris Redfield plastic surgery'd himself back to how he's meant to look
Resident Evil Village,Action,"Better than it's predecessor. Definitely pick this one up. I got it for $26 from a black friday sale. Edit: after fully completing this game I have to say, one of the best Resident Evil games ever made, phenomenal story which is linked from RE7, great game play and good puzzle solving. Look forward to replaying this on the hardest difficulty! :) I'd have to honestly give this one a 10/10 not one flaw to note!"
Resident Evil Village,Action,"Definitely not the best game and story in the series with some terrible dialogue and voice acting as well. However, it still managed to be much more fun than I expected and gave me one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I've had in the past few months. It also ran and looks great. My Score: 8/10"
Resident Evil Village,Action,Great horror experience.  DLC story was great also.   Would recommend.
DiRT Rally,"Racing, Simulation, Sports",more like DeRP Rally fr the PS3 game is better than this
DiRT Rally,"Racing, Simulation, Sports","Simply put: best Rally sim far and wide even though still in early access; Yet the devs are working quite hard on improving, enhancing, debugging, expanding (unlike those of many other ""eternal early access"" games). A good wheel with FF (and ideally with H-shifter, as the support is perfect even now and is being polished gradually) is a MUST to enjoy the game fully, if you intend to play it with keyboard, just please don't. Also, I'd like to stress how important a wheel controller for playing this game, much more than any other racing game I've played so far. And a word of advice - if you intend to play this game with keyboard or gamepad, don't you dare to post a neg review. -KTHXBYE"

Return of the Obra Dinn,"Adventure, Indie","Well, it really is as good as everyone says."
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Adventure, Indie","It has flaws, but they are relatively minor compared to how incredibly unique the gameplay, art style, and presentation is. It pushes the boundaries on a ""living"" (technically dead) mystery that you experience firsthand and have to unravel. Kinda like a ""Logic Grid Puzzle"" with referencing and cross referencing things. There are a few times that are very frustrating and super niche. You also have to be fairly ""racist"" and make a lot of super stereotypical assumptions, which is disappointing, but it is definitely a game I'd recommend for those who like mysteries and more experimental games. 7/10"

Crysis 3 Remastered,Action,Not fun.
Crysis 3 Remastered,Action,Not good as the other Crysis games and it is a bit short but it is a decent pew-pew game with unnecessary skill level up system and a basic setting.
Saints Row IV: Re-Elected,"Action, Adventure",EXPLOSIONS !
Saints Row IV: Re-Elected,"Action, Adventure","Didn't plan on buying this, Still kind of upset at the change of tone they did from SR2 to sr3. SR4 Is a little buggy, the lack of mid-mission autosaves is infuriating considering how this game likes to crash in the middle of a 30 minute mission. but has some hilarious parts too"
Saints Row IV: Re-Elected,"Action, Adventure","Tried to play it again after a few years, game asks for EGS account. Dead to me."
Saints Row IV: Re-Elected,"Action, Adventure",Very Good
Saints Row IV: Re-Elected,"Action, Adventure",aliens love bing chilling
Saints Row IV: Re-Elected,"Action, Adventure","Saints Row row row your boat gently down the stream, merrily, merrily, merrily this life is but a dream. --What is it?-- A third person action game, with you playing the part of a charismatic leader in a open world, where you can pretty much do anything your heart desires. Lots of weapons to use, shooting, melee weapons, even a super hero fighting style. You can drive pretty much anything you can get your hands on. The game is set in a virtual world that is intentionally made to look not as good, had it just been set in the real world, and that being said, it's not that bad. However the colours and overall appearance of everything is somewhat limited in their attempt to make it look like a obviously fake, realistic themed virtual world. A big step forward in the character models detail department. With much better looking character models and modifications than Saints row 3. A step backwards in the story and game theme department. There are some great moments in the story, with brilliant quests with unique animations for those specific story moments. Fantastic and enjoyable game, that I highly recommend, it runs really good on my modesty system. Everything is way over the top, and it's fun that way."
Saints Row IV: Re-Elected,"Action, Adventure",SAINTS ROW 4 IS JUST ON OF THE BEST FICTIONAL AND TRUE FUTURE STORYLINE GAMES EVER MADE BY VIOLATION HAVING FUN KILLING ENEMIES AND TAKING REVENGE IS ALL BUT YES THIS GAME WAS A LITTLE SHORT COMPARED TO SAINTS ROW 3
Saints Row IV: Re-Elected,"Action, Adventure","At first I was concerned that this game wasn't going to be much, I was worried the super powers weren't going to be fun. I was worried this was just going to feel like DLC, I was wrong. It's astounding how much super powers add to this game, I don't even care that the game is set in the same city since the powers make the game play completely different, vehicles take a complete backseat. Although you still can play music from the radio stations, now it just plays wherever you can go, which makes it really awesome when you get in a big fight on the streets and you have heavy electronic music blasting. The characters are all there, the humor is all there, and it went full on crazy without holding back. Everything has been building up to this game, it really feels like this game is the collective result of everything that was learned during development of the last 3 saints row games. The only question is, what will they do now? P.S. There was a rumour that was haunting this game for a long time, that the scrapped DLC 'Enter The Dominatrix' was taken from Saints Row 3 and made into Saints Row 4. That's incorect, they looked at the contents of the DLC and decided it fit into the crazies of saints row 4 and made it DLC for that game. So its DLC for one game getting pushed to the next game, not DLC for SR3 being made into SR4"
Saints Row IV: Re-Elected,"Action, Adventure","An actual Review As i finished the game in under 24 hours id say the game is pretty good ig. even if i don't know what the hell is going on from time to time and even when i finished the third one in the series i'd still say the game is fun as gta v. Saints row 4 has lack of attention to detail to the map and npcs compared to other open world games. saints row 4 for me is focused on the fun and over the top ♥♥♥♥ the gameplay is. the complaints i only have is the makeshift minigun, rocket, flamethrower hybrid dlc weapon and the blast power when you have it to that chain-reaction upgrade is too over-powered you can capture flashpoints and kill enemies in just one blast and the hybrid of a dlc weapon is over-powered too even when its not upgraded to the max. but then again i still like the game because it's focused on the fun for me. and the other dlc that i bought with the game for only 2 bucks are nice. especially the one with the op weapon and the anime pack (not because i'm a weeb. i thought it look nice). And my overall rating of the game as a kid is that this game is nice 7.5/10"

Gears 5,"Action, Adventure","It was a bit of a mess when it launched but it has been cleaned up and there is more communication with the devs. Horde Is way better balanced now and from what i hear it will be even better next season. the matchmaking system has been streamlined for quick matches, and the custom browser is there for wave 50 classic modes. every character can now buy every weapon and defenses making play with jack and del much easier. the money taps now also give the team a health boost Fan Favourites are back and have their own suite of abilities in horde, versus and escape. along with skins and such to unlock via the battlepass-like leveling up system. Many bugs and problems have been solved however some still remain in horde with jack and some in campaign that may require a few resets or the host skipping ahead for a tutorial section and then inviting the buddy back, 3 player campaign is still a treat. Escape is still meh. i don't care for it much, there's more content and characters there A new currency has been introduced as a reward for challenges and levelling up. this now allows you to buy all your characters and skins, every single one! this is major upgrade over the stupid totem system and you will be compensated for any you haven not finished if you are returning after the totem update. Versus still has many modes ranging between bot training, ranked, casual and arcade modes which all vary in flow and intensity. there are no reverse horde type modes yet from gears 3 and judgement, which i am hoping for. Overall the new progress and unlock system really gives you more incentive to play longer hours as its easier to get and upgrade these new and old school characters. The horde modes rebalancing gives you both quick matches where defenses don't matter so much and more versatility in classic matches for the weaker support characters, it really helps that the assualt characters can make defenses but it does not break the game as the defensive characters still excel at constructing and repairing your base. Being able to buy every gun as every character took the tedium out of finding a replacement when you die or spawn at wave 1 Currently Exactly what i wanted from a new gears game. P.S please work on the bugs with jack in the campaign and horde!!!"
Gears 5,"Action, Adventure","*This review is exclusive to the campaign of the game, which is the only part I care* Gears (of war) 5 has a very good campaign, after Gears of War 4 I though this series had no saving, but GoW5 actually brought in a great campaign, with refined combat, much better characters and some cool addictions to the combat. The only negatives I can think are some very strange bugs that have not been fixed yet for some reason, and the open world parts are a mixed bag, they can get annoying fast and I would not miss them if they are gone. Overall, it's a pretty good game, it's not as good as the first trilogy, but it gets the job done."
Gears 5,"Action, Adventure",split screen campaign is very nice. multiplayer is entertaining for a couple of hours. but the amount of micro-transactions in the multiplayer part is utterly disgusting. only buy this game at a heavy discount. vote with your wallet.
Gears 5,"Action, Adventure","It felt like just another shooter with some scenes and some snowmobile part. Story was mediocre, graphics were decent and gameplay wasn’t really smooth. Especially at the hardest difficulty. Honestly, it felt like another over-hyped series. You can try it with a discount though. It is not really expensive at sales."

Call of Duty®: WWII,Action,"This is the best cod campaign out of any cod game, it's basically a WW2 movie that you can play through. Zombie mode in this game is great. Graphics are incredible."
Call of Duty®: WWII,Action,"Silly but fun gameplay, quite decent storyline, lots of exploding things and a tad too short but all in all I got my money's worth considering I bought it on a sale."
Call of Duty®: WWII,Action,"Expected this to be another generic and boring CoD game, but I was actually surprised with how fun the campaign was. I also enjoyed the zombies mode more than usual and I really liked the design of the zombies. However, don't expect anything really different from the multiplayer mode, it's what you'd expect and for me personally that's a negative. It's gotten old for me so I don't enjoy CoD games' multiplayer. Just the same old run and gun CoD multiplayer, but if you enjoy that then you'll probably have fun with it."
Depression Quest,"Free To Play, Indie, RPG, Simulation","Play The Cat Lady instead of this pretentious pile of patronizing garbo. Speaking as someone who's had pretty bad depression for over 15 years, this sucks. The Cat Lady is infinitely more relatable to me.

Half-Life 2,Action,"Probably the most beloved of any game I've ever played. Almost 13 years later and I can still pick it up once in a while and enjoy it. This game from 2004 has it all,  In terms of gameplay, it's got both faced paced action,  slow paced exploration, horror, humor . the works. In terms of a narrative, the experience is pretty bare bones since you're a silent protaganist, but I honestley believe the Half Life universe is one of the downright creepiest and most disturbing out there.  When you stop to look around, this is a world where humanity has suffered billions of deaths from extra-dimensional invasions. and those who survive are slowly being enslaved and exterminated by hostile wildlife in the wake of the events of the first game, and an omnipresent prime evil in the Combine. Really nothing else to say... Like a lot of people this game was one of the biggest influences to me as a gamer. It doesn't look all that great by today's standards.. but man, if you didn't get to try this in the mid 2000s.  boy did you miss out."

DOOM Eternal,Action,ONE OF THE BEST FPS OF THIS DECADE.DEMON GO BOOM. ME LIKEY
DOOM Eternal,Action,doom 2016 is better but this is still a good game
DOOM Eternal,Action,"Glorious graphics and entertaining comedy elements, my friends already finished the game because 8-10 Hours game play. Not worth the money.  Refunded. Get it when it's on a huge sale a year later or so., Bought the game back when it was on discount, Doom has basically turned into a platform game with this one and frankly you do more jumping and figuring out how to get to a damn ledge rather than shooting. Sadly no, not worth it if you are a classic Doom lover."
DOOM Eternal,Action,easily one of the best first person shooters of the last decade. soundtrack is among the greatest of all time

Space Hulk: Deathwing Enhanced Edition,"Action, Adventure","Everything is good and nice and all but they really tried hard to stop people from playing alone by making things especially hard, and in multiplayer if you arent 3-4 people you dont stand a chance, one dies has to wait 250+ seconds while the other tries to survive and there's no 3rd person bot like in SP... sheesh what a chore."

Batman - The Telltale Series,Adventure,has SELINA KYLE
Batman - The Telltale Series,Adventure,it really makes you FEEL like Batman
Batman - The Telltale Series,Adventure,"First of all, I am not a big fan of Batman; actually, Batman annoys me and I bought this game just because it is a Telltale game. I had no expectation from the series but surprisingly it was pretty good. Story wasn’t bad at all. Mafia connection and not being a shining moral compass give the story some depth. I enjoyed this Gotham more than any of the Batman productions. Contrary to black-white aspect of the movies, this game’s universe has a motive behind crime and it makes the atmosphere darker. Other than that, some of the choices are bigger than other games of the same developer. Although, it is still pretty linear. Even though voice acting feels a bit weird at first (because it is different from the mainstream), you get used to it. Gameplay is a bit different than regular Telltale games. There are lots of quick time events and some basic detective work other than talking. Even being Bruce Wayne isn’t boring in this game."
Batman - The Telltale Series,Adventure,"Good, 7/10"
Batman - The Telltale Series,Adventure,Fresh look on the genre. It's extremly linear with zero meaningful choices but storyline is good nonetheless.
Batman - The Telltale Series,Adventure,"Batman villains are interesting, Batman himself is boring.  That has always been the case with Batman, but this interactive story has finally solved the problem by giving Batman personal and convincing connections to his villains.  Bruce Wayne and Harvey are best friends.  Bruce Wayne and Oswald Cobblepot knew each other as peers as children and Bruce's parents were the cause of the Cobblepots' decline.  It's all very interesting and makes you invested in the characters and their fates to a greater extent than in any other Batman medium. The game feels like a Choose Your Adventure, but there are only a few choices that have lasting consequences (and those are very interesting, with some of them not being obvious at the time.  You might want to look up information about other people's playthroughs if you get to the end and don't feel this is the case), but mostly the choices affect how other characters feel about you and about how you feel about the other characters.  Because of this, the vast majority of the subplots feel extremely satisfying when they come to their conclusions.  That is a bit less the case as far the main plot goes.  It has a very cool twist and everything you learn about the mastermind is interesting, but in its case that hardly matters when the final scene is merely a drawn out fight with hardly anything interesting said.  To an extent that scene turns out to be more about Batman and Alfred's relationship than Batman and the villains (going by the sequel to this game) and that's a bit disappointing. But don't let that small quibble distract you from the wonderful storylines involving Selina, Harvey, and Oswald, Gordon, Alfred (though that doesn't get its payoff til the next game), and Bruce himself.   That's the vast majority of the game, and even the majority of the main plot is great too. I love it.  Best Batman so far.  It's among the more mature depictions of Batman, and not in ways that you feel are only there to earn it in the label.  And the next season is even better."
Batman - The Telltale Series,Adventure,Great Game. :)
ICY: Frostbite Edition,RPG,"Well written story-focused game in an interesting postapocalyptic ice age. There are RPG elements and a decent amount of simple combat, but the game mainly focuses on text based events and story decisions. The game's branching story may be hit or miss for some people as there is often one choice that feels like the ""good"" one, but I felt like the options were generally realistic and fit with the theme. There are a few bugs where the main quest can fail to trigger the next step, so I recommend saving periodically using the multiple save slots to give yourself staggered backups, and you may need to check the forums if reloading doesn't fix it. Other than that my biggest frustration was that there wasn't any indication which loot was vendor trash and which loot would be useful for crafting later. I really enjoyed experiencing the world, interacting with the people, the feeling of progression in my group, and reading the story. If you think the game looks interesting, I highly recommend it."
The Forgotten City,"Adventure, Indie, RPG",Great game.  Awesome story and interesting fun game mechanics.  Very little to complain about with this game.  I would definitely recommend.
The Forgotten City,"Adventure, Indie, RPG","This thing is absolute cinema. I don't even like narrative games, and I was HOOKED for 7 hours straight. Absolutely amazing game, much better than I expected. Best Skyrim mod ever, it gave us this awesome game."
The Forgotten City,"Adventure, Indie, RPG","It is good, but not great. Like a worse Outer Wilds, which makes it still something I'd recommend, but would suggest getting it on sale. If you like ancient Rome / mythology and philosophy more than exploration, figuring out puzzles, and thinking outside the box, then this might be better for you than Outer Wilds, but outside of that just go for Outer Wilds. There's a lot to like, but some really clunky and out of place things. For a game about solving a mystery, there are some odd design decisions around ""action"" sections. I also noticed a few bugs or other minor problems with some dialogue options. Feels like this game could have been polished a lot more and more work done to having more viable options at a few key areas. Often feels railroaded and pushing you into a specific choice instead of a more free form game, which hurts it. For me, the game was incredibly easy and I figured out almost everything pretty early on. Granted, I've studied mythology and philosophy pretty heavily, so this might be cool to someone who is interested in the topics but hasn't done a dive into it. I do wish the company best and will be curious to see what games they make in the future, but for now just wait to get this on sale or if you REALLY want another ""time loop deduction-ish"" style game and nothing else is scratching that itch for you. 6.5/10"
Labyrinth: The War on Terror,"Simulation, Strategy",abandonware dont buy this unfinished product.
Labyrinth: The War on Terror,"Simulation, Strategy",Excellent adaptation of an excellent game
Rebel Cops,Strategy,"This a turn-based tactical game with resource management mechanics. It looks like developers wanted to follow a more populistic way after This is the Police. There isn’t any strong aspect of This is the Police franchise unfortunately. There isn’t a real story, soundtrack is repetitive, tactical combat is limited, levelling is weak and resource management is just there to be there. First of all, the story, it is overtly not the main aspect of the game. It is just there, because it needs to be. It is for providing a concept but even with that it is bad. You are in a really small town with a huge crime ring. There are hundreds of people in this mob weirdly. You can’t grasp why are you working with a known dirty cop, even though you have an evidence against him. However, Warren Nash helps you until the end. Secondly, repetition. There isn’t any variety in soundtrack and there aren’t many tracks either. Unfortunately, biggest negative part about the game is limited and repetitive gameplay. Every mechanical aspect of the game is stretched. There are only two different types of enemies, less than ten skills and three attributes. Because of these limited gameplay features, you can’t do anything different playing the game. Other than that, there is a resource management part of the game which feels forced. As a vigilante you shouldn’t have a budget and an arsenal to fight the crime, I agree with that part but while you can loot the missions for TVs, PCs or video cassettes you can’t loot the criminals for their weapons or ammo. That is just plain non-sense. Stealth isn’t such a good option either. It doesn’t reward the player catching criminals instead of killing them – there is the advantage of not using the ammo though – and shooting strategy is easier (thanks to charging AI). On the bright side, there is some variety for the missions and there isn’t much games in this category. So, if you like games likes XCOM or UFO series which don’t have a strong story you may like this game. Plus, there wasn’t any bug and the price is pretty reasonable."
Rebel Cops,Strategy,Don't expect anything like the combat in X-Com. This is more like a puzzle.
Rebel Cops,Strategy,"Wow, I have not played previous games of the series as I'm not a fan of cops vs criminals genre but this one is a hidden gem. It should appeal to all avid turn-base tactics players as it's really demanding and if you're stupid you can always blame RNG so it's a win-win situation!"
Dying Light 2 Stay Human: Reloaded Edition,"Action, Adventure, RPG",Fun game
Dying Light 2 Stay Human: Reloaded Edition,"Action, Adventure, RPG","I tried to like this game. I really did. In theory I'm the target market for it, and there is a fun game buried somewhere inside, but honestly, it's just kind of meh. The controls and game mechanics are clunky and borderline buggy at times. The para glider sucks and is too hard to control. The parkour doesn't feel smooth. The characters aren't all that likeable. There's more clipping through walls or sticking to walls or falling through floors than there should be in a game like this. I kept playing it because I felt at some point it should get fun, but 25 hours in I've kind of given up. I couldn't recommend this game unless it's on deep special and you really have nothing else to play. Update: I did eventually finish the game out of boredom. No, I don't regret anything I wrote in my original review, only to add that the final boss fight is probably the lamest I've encountered in a game for many years and just as buggy as the rest of the game, even after all these years."
Dying Light 2 Stay Human: Reloaded Edition,"Action, Adventure, RPG","it was a fun playthrough, i miss a lot of stuff from the old game, the game got worse when we got the grappelinghook(like dying light) playing like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ spiderman. at launch there has been a lot of bugs all the way. the most gamebreaking bug is the survivorsense not working properly, makes us look forever until it works. my ♥♥♥♥ is bent please like this review"
Dying Light 2 Stay Human: Reloaded Edition,"Action, Adventure, RPG","Pretty fun so far, but my brother's game keeps crashing whenever I play coop with him. Seems to be happening even more now than when the game first launched. Wait till this game is fixed then buy it. Edit: coop bug is fixed, but overall still very buggy after all this time. Unbelievable"
Dying Light 2 Stay Human: Reloaded Edition,"Action, Adventure, RPG",its inferior to the first one but im changing my review to positive becuase they gave us a better lawan skin. it was totally unfair that china gets all the good stuff! so thanks for sharing!
Dying Light 2 Stay Human: Reloaded Edition,"Action, Adventure, RPG",has a lot of glitches but an overall fun game
Dying Light 2 Stay Human: Reloaded Edition,"Action, Adventure, RPG",I'm loving the game so far.
Dying Light 2 Stay Human: Reloaded Edition,"Action, Adventure, RPG","I didn't really get hooked into this game like I did with the first one. I sunk hundreds of hours into the first game on Xbox when it came out and came back for each DLC, especially The Following and the free content updates. The gameplay and movement felt really fluid, and the game was legit scary at night, and you felt like a superhero when you levelled up and got each skill. Dying Light 2 from what I did play, and watch feels like an upgrade in some areas, and a downgrade in a lot of others for ME, which is really sad because I was really excited for this one. Stuff like climbing and parkour does not feel nearly as satisfying as the first game which was a turnoff as that was a big portion of the game, and the same with enemies, especially with the dumb healthbar trend games seem to be following now. It feels like a mobile game, or just not even close to the original if you put them side by side at a glance. The graphics and performance are also kinda ehhh. In some areas they can be really good, but in others pretty bad. Maybe I'll come back to this game in the future, but if you're expecting stuff to be nearly as satisfying and cool as the first game, I really wouldn't recommend it, it's a shame."
Dying Light 2 Stay Human: Reloaded Edition,"Action, Adventure, RPG","Game needs a lot of fixes, the parkour is broken, doesn't respond every command you give, the challenges are broken, the whole challenge route is broken and lacks imagination and its not complete to reach gold medal. Not with parkour broken. The story is good but the game mechanics need an update ASAP or the game is unplayable on Hard mode"
Dying Light 2 Stay Human: Reloaded Edition,"Action, Adventure, RPG",they basically turned the gameplay back into dying light 1 after everryone complained lol... no complaints

Sid Meier's Starships,Strategy,"It's not going to win any GOTY awards, but I enjoy the relaxed, bite sized 4X-lite for what it is."
Sid Meier's Starships,Strategy,"A super simplified 4x game. It is incredibly shallow but it had enough decisions involved for me to enjoy it as sort of a mindless time waster. I beat it once on normal and never looked back. I wouldn't pay more than a deep sale price for it (66%+). You get to take over planets, research tech, build a fleet, and fight other empires, but everything is very simple to the point of feeling limited. You only get one fleet - yes that's right, one fleet total. The entirety of your combat and conquering happens with that one fleet. You have a ""fleet fatigue"" counter which means you have to manage your turn to be as efficient as possible with your fleet. Research techs have different names but come down to 9 categories that just ""level up"", rather than some kind of tree with decisions to make about similar space drives with different advantages or anything like that. There are ""wonder"" type things that provide bonuses. Planets can have very simple buildings built to improve them. Combat is turn based with a hex grid, and you get to make decisions on how you outfit your fleet (weapons/shields/etc take up space and add weight which require stronger weapons to move farther per turn). Overall I felt like the decision making was fun and I especially enjoyed outfitting my fleet and planning out my turn movements. But it also was so simple that by the time I beat a game it felt like I'd seen everything I needed to see. I have 5.5 hours playtime total, but I did spend a couple scrapped games figuring things out so that's basically 1.5 games. I'd recommend the game if you want a fun simple 4x that's almost mindless, or you like 4x but find them too complex with too much stuff to manage, or you want a simple intro to the genre (although Endless Space is a better intro imo). Be aware that you might not find much replayability value. If you're looking for anything like Civ or Orion, don't bother."

The Raven - Legacy of a Master Thief,Adventure,"Last chapter of the game is riddled with bugs. Some of them, such as disappearing items, can prevent you from finishing the game. There are also terrible plot holes and inconsistencies to the point that the whole story does not make any sense. After finishing the game I can say I am sorely disappointed. If you want to play a good detective game do yourself a favor and buy Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishement."
Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition,Strategy,"I've changed my opinion on this game since they have finally gotten off their asses and improved the AI, Graphics Optimization and somewhat on stability,  but it still doesnt excuse the massive budget for a game that has less polish than it's predecessors. I'm also still pretty uncofident over the stability of this game,  I can't wait until I get to turn 100-110 and the save becomes corrupted and unplayable. go team."
Star Conflict,"Action, Adventure, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Simulation, Free To Play","You go into battle with several team mates, no one does anything while you try to capture all the points and push the enemy away all by yourself and die several hundred times, you end up being the first player in every match but your team loses so you dont earn the crystals bonuses etc. You enter a match with a level X ship, the enemy team is made up of ships several levels higher than yours, so you cant even scratch their shields, you die several times being completely ineffective, your team loses since they arent doing anything anyway. You decide to go alone patrol the freespace, some random several levels higher player ship turns rogue on you, single shots you and loots your stuff and you go back to hangar. This is this game summarized."
Star Conflict,"Action, Adventure, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Simulation, Free To Play",good
Endzone - A World Apart,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy","Post-Release Edit: This has come out of Early Access nicely. Everything feels a little more polished, there's more fun scenarios to play, the tutorials have been improved, and a simple combat mechanic has been added. The devs just released (4/29) another major patch improving the UI and UX across the board. If you want a medium complexity base builder, I highly recommend this game. ------------------------ Original Early Access Review If you want a peaceful survival colony builder, then I 100% recommend this game. The game can be fully enjoyed as-is, and Early Access is being handled well. The devs are quite active - fixing bugs, adding features, communicating with the community. There's no enemies so survival is the only source of challenge. You have to build carefully to balance growth versus meeting your survivors' needs (food, water, health, and happiness).  The atmosphere is really good, gives a nice postapocalyptic feel, especially with the radiation concerns. I really enjoyed the expedition mechanic. You can send small parties off to explore ruins to gain resources and bonuses. Some benefit from sending survivors with certain skills. Some have minor scripted events. You will hit a point where there's nothing new to do in a city after 10-20 hours depending on how you play. Restarting can feel pretty linear, you know the build order and techs you need. I am hopeful that this will improve as the devs work on the game, but currently if you want to make only 1 city and keep growing it forever this is definitely a drawback. Scenarios are the main replay value right now, their tweaked requirements help change things up. I've only tried 2, the seed race did not do anything new but the drought one definitely pushed me to approach things differently which I enjoyed a lot. I plan to try another scenario soon, which will be my 4th city - that should tell you how much I'm enjoying the game :) I'm looking forward to the continued development, but even in its current state it's a fun play. Strongly recommended for anyone who is interested."

Halo: The Master Chief Collection,Action,"I know most of these reviews just say 'hey it's Halo' but I really want to break something down. It is 6 story campaigns, 6 multiplayer games with tones of modes, and co-op modes that are so full of content that you won't believe this costs $40 dollars. There's nothing more to be said on if this is a good deal for the money, it's out of the question. There's just too much here and we aren't even paying full price. Sure we are missing Halo 5 Guardians to have all of the games in one collection, but on the plus side, we are missing Halo 5 Guardians. This is one of those series that I do believe everyone should at least play once if they're an FPS fan, right there with Half Life, Goldeneye, Doom, Quake etc. There's arguments to be made on if things hold up as well (looking at you Halo CE, you have some incredible MP maps but others that make me think you were a bit sleepy at the wheel.) But the series is undoubtedly important, and permanently serves as a monument to the culture of the 2000s. And this isn't even coming from someone wrapped up in the nostalgia for it, I actually only played the first one, which when viewed with the entire package stands out as the most obtuse.  It had a major hand in shaping both the Singleplayer and Multiplayer landscape of this millennium. I do think that the single player story is perhaps the main thing that hasn't really aged well. Video game writing in general has taken massive leaps in quality and Halo 4, despite being more recent, never really picked up that slack. So don't expect to be crying tears at the end of any particular game. But the soundtrack is still gorgeous and there's nothing like the shifts from the linear corridors of ships to completely opening up with vehicles and a huge area to explore, The multiplayer though is something that still feels fairly unique to the franchise. The time to kill opponents is way higher than other popular shooters at the time such as the Call of Duty and Battlefield franchises that frankly I really don't understand why they were compared that way back in the way. But hey, people also were way more into the 'console wars' back then. What this game does need to fully capture the spirit of MP gaming in the 2000s is a Custom Games browser, which was supposed to come out a couple weeks ago but has been met with delays. But at least it's almost here, and the custom games is when the creativity of the community using the map editor 'Forge' really comes to shine. So this already package is going to be even better soon."
Halo: The Master Chief Collection,Action,I wanted to like halo but the shooting is messy and boring and the enemies are bullet sponges. the story is somehow interesting and the mechanics were good but the gameplay wasn't fun - at least for me. but to be fair the collection is well made and organized and the price is okay.
Halo: The Master Chief Collection,Action,i love this series more than life itself

Halo: The Master Chief Collection,Action,This is the ultimate Halo game 20/10
Halo: The Master Chief Collection,Action,"It is a decent game series but nothing more. I played the games one after another and couldn’t see much of a difference; there isn’t many different enemies or weapons, levels are similar (first game’s level design is so annoying at that part), etc. However, it is a very good game series for its time, especially with the marine support mechanics like driving and using guns. Co-op system was good for its time but nowadays it is pretty far behind. Obviously, graphics and sound design are old and there are some bugs. Still, music is epic. Most of the songs and their usage are great. I can easily say that soundtrack is the best element of the game. Other than that, story has its ups and downs. As you can expect from a shooter game, story isn’t really original but it doesn’t annoy you. So, if you didn’t play the game like me, you didn’t miss much but it has a reasonable price to try it."
Halo: The Master Chief Collection,Action,"Great game, great story. A must have in your library"
Halo: The Master Chief Collection,Action,"After being unable to play the game for weeks because my server region was incorrect. I do not have any interest in playing halo online just all of the stories but of course im forced to have a stable connection so they can spy on me. After buying it and refunding it,  and repurchasing it after I head the issue was fixed. Now I cannot alt-tab from the game at all because it just disappears but continues to play audio! WHY DOES A MICROSOFT GAME HAVE SO MANY ISSUES ON A MICROSOFT OPERATING SYSTEM!!!!!"

Half-Life,Action,"A lot of old classics fail to stand the test of time. They are clunky, boring, uninteresting, and look like crap. Half Life is not one of those games. The visual style is great for what it is, the gameplay is fun and complex, and it has a very lengthy story. If you have the worst of the worst pc specs and can't even run potato games, I would absolutely recommend this at full price. Otherwise, on sale it is a must buy for the price."
State of Decay,"Action, RPG, Simulation","The Dead Walk, and you're our only Hope State of Decay is one of examples of lighting in a bottle. Back in 2012 when I first heard of this game I was confused since it was relatively hidden an unknown at the time primarily due to it being stuck on the XBOX exclusively. Years go by and a dear friend of mine sends me the game so he can get my impressions. At first I didn't like it. I thought it was a boring hot mess with bad voice acting and reptitive action. A year later while I was struck with a spell of sickness I decided to give it a second chance and boy did I feel dumb. This game is yes, very lack luster at points due to the often embarassing voice work but it retrospect it fits very well. The game has a very B-Movie feel to it. Zombies tend to walk at a slow rate and some dart after you. There is also the odd special zombie to mix things up a little. The best feature of this game has to be the ability to build settlements and form bases out of homes and shops giving the game a much larger game beneath the base game. However perma-death is in play so don't be getting to attached to the lead roll or really any character in general since there are random events that will happen that will very result in their demise. I say give it a try and at the time of writing this review I have not played the DLCs."
State of Decay,"Action, RPG, Simulation","Amazing survival game, quite realistic compared to many others, very exciting"
State of Decay,"Action, RPG, Simulation",Fantastic zombie survival open world goodness.
F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin,Action,"One of the worst sequels ever made. Literally a downgrade to the original in almost every way imaginable. It's not even Fear anymore, it's just a boring generic a*s military shooter with a not great slowmo mechanic. The only parts that are any good are the bits where you ride around in a robot, but that doesn't make up for the fact that the rest of the game is utter crap."
F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin,Action,"Definitely not as good as the first game, but it is a decent FPS with fun gun play. The first 2-3 hrs and the school level later in the game are the best parts of the game and I very much enjoyed them. But in my personal opinion all the other levels were either mediocre or downright boring. Once I got to the last hour of the game I was so ready to be done with it that I lowered the difficulty just to finish it faster. 6/10"
F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin,Action,10/10 would bang
F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin,Action,"Storywise, it's better than Fear 1. Gameplay-wise, it's worse. Can't believe they removed the ability to lean and downgraded the physics so much. It's a way above average game tho, recommended. (Also, Reborn is pretty sweet :)"
Empyrion - Galactic Survival,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",meh
DOOM 3,Action,"an actually decent game.  yes, the shoulder mounted flashlight causes most of the tension to fly out the window, but on the upside it turns the game into a more half-life-like game."
DOOM 3,Action,"Talk about a game that stands the test of time. Still gorgeous, doesn't feel like a traditional Doom game, but damn the hype for this game 15 years ago was sick. Still really fun."
DOOM 3,Action,sux
DOOM 3,Action,Who the hell renamed my doom 3 to Nekopara 3 !? What the f--k!? OH HELL NAH !
DOOM 3,Action,"Doom 3 has the extremely dubious distinction of having the absolute worst shotgun in any fps ever made. Personally I think Quake 4 is better. The shotgun in that game is actually good. Not Doom 1/2 or Quake 1/2 good, but a lot better than Doom 3's shotgun at least. It also has a chaingun that isn't super slow and inaccurate. Oh and one last thing, this game is piss easy. Don't play it on anything less than veteran. Nightmare can f*ck off with it's 25 max hp though. That's f*cking stupid and whoever thought that was a good idea should be shot. This game sucks a lot worse than I remember it"
DOOM 3,Action,"plays more like resident evil than doom at times, but fortunately I really like resident evil"

Pretty good fun when you don't take it too seriously."
Tactical Assault VR,"Action, Simulation, Early Access","A great combat simulator. BE WARNED using this game with VD ""Virtual desktop"" can lead to some issues posted on the F&Q, Other than that after minimal adjustment I was able to play the game flawlessly for the amount of time aquitted."
F.E.A.R.,Action,"Not much to say besides that this is one of the best FPS games of all times and that it is a timeless classic, which blends perfectly small elements of tactical shooters, such as peeking through corners and silently approaching an encounter, with the arcade fun that only those mid 2000's games could offer. I honestly wish Monolith would develop more games like this, even though their take on LOTR is really good."
F.E.A.R.,Action,"It's BS that you need to now buy the entire fear trilogy in order to get this game, but aside from that, this game is an amazing FPS classic that I highly recommend. The game play, graphics, gore, combat dialogue, and AI are amazing. The only thing I didn't really care for were that the levels are (imo) a bit bland looking and all looked kind of similar after a while, but aside from that, I really can't complain. If you are a fan of FPS games, then this is one you really should check out. My score: 8.5/10"
F.E.A.R.,Action,"Whoever thought it was a good idea to periodically disable the slowmo button should be shot, in slowmo. Oh and this is my favorite FPS ever. Really can't recommend it more highly."
F.E.A.R.,Action,"One of the most fun, well designed fps games ever made"

Guild of Dungeoneering Ultimate Edition,"Indie, RPG","Lost a dungeon crawl to the ritual BS because I could not get any proper corridor tiles to path there. Lost it a second time because my dumb ♥♥♥♥ of a Ranger kept going after level 2s as a level 4 instead of the level 3 enemy I put on the objective tile (There were no lower lvl enemies showing up). An AI that prioritizes anything over the objective goal is one of the dumbest things I've seen in over 15 years of gaming. Whoever made that decision, or the idiot that designed the level 3 ritual dungeon where you lose in X turns needs to GTFO the industry. I sincerely hope you DIAF and don't breed before doing so."
Guild of Dungeoneering Ultimate Edition,"Indie, RPG","A game with not much replayable ,cleared in 10 hours, hoping for new dlc release ,or kind of random dungeon mode"
Circadian Dice,Strategy,"An amazing dice based deckbuilder with the unique hook being that you can customize your dice with improved faces.  To make the choices a little trickier, dice faces come in 2-packs so when you purchase new faces for a die, you'll be replacing 2 linked faces and it can get tricky when you really only wanted to replace 1 of your designated die's faces or if 1 of the 2 linked faces you bought from the store is a real stinker compared to what it would be replacing.  The game is also amazing with all of its unlockable content.  You'll be almost guaranteed to unlock a new class, relic, or location after every successful run."
Supermarket Together,"Casual, Indie, Simulation, Free To Play","Pretty enjoyable game, especially with friends. Weirdly, it supports 16 people and it is much more than most co-op games. Invitation system at Steam is broken but you can join from the game by the host’s name. Although, the graphics are very old (animations are funny at least) and the gameplay is simple, this game is both enjoyable and relaxing experience (a bit stressful at the beginning). Since there is no clear direction, you have to find some of the things by trying like using numpad or placement controls. Another enjoyable part is the broom mechanic. Plus, this game gets updates which was a surprise for me, since it is free. Definitely, I recommend this game."

Broken Sword 2 - the Smoking Mirror: Remastered (2010),"Adventure, Casual",Everything bad about this style of adventure game in one game.  I mean even the story was bad.  And what is with George's girlfriend?  Everytime he's away from France for 2 seconds she starts sleeping with someone else and they have to rebuild their relationship from scratch in the current episode.  Play the Gabriel Knight games instead.  It has the same boy/girl dynamic and general kind of mystery but is much better written.
Broken Sword 2 - the Smoking Mirror: Remastered (2010),"Adventure, Casual","They dont make them like this these days, thanks for making my childhood highly enjoyable. Broken Sword 1 and 2 are masterpieces."
Nearwood - Collector's Edition,Adventure,"Hard to go wrong with this one. Has excellent artwork, good voice acting, decent visuals, and modest puzzles (They could use a little work imo but were good) Only real nitpicking I can do is that theres a bit too much back and forth. Best part was that the hidden object scenes were nice and simple, a bit cleaner than the normal sprawled out junkyard you normally see. This game earned a solid 10 bucks from me"

Adeptus Titanicus: Dominus,Strategy,"I didn't like it, though its not a bad game at all. Just not my thing, I didn't get what was the point, the robots it felt abit the same for me. I think if Id play the tabletop maybe Id be more into the entourage of the game. Its nice made, cool sound, nice graphics and would recommend if you like slow pace robot shooting, I just think in the end I didnt feel the hits hitting for real, so I didnt get it, still reccomend, there nothing wrong with the game, you just need to be into this. Edit 8 July  2019: I tried it again, and I liked it a little bit more it keeps looking good, the robot still look good, they shoot better a bit even. My issue now is still that there is no point in the game, it's more a try out of robots with a small object and thats it. It's still so empty the game, no story, no real modes of leaderboards or anything. Something lke your own custom robot. Else i think I would start to play, if theres something to play for, a story or something even. New robots, maps to unlock maybe, than the devs dont need to feel like they have to hurry, but still gives the player things to unlock, as they develop more."

Minion Masters,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy, Free To Play","Edit: 5 years later and the game is still trash. 2 battles in and I was reminded entirely of why I quit. This game is a masterpiece when it comes to making you feel helpless, especially in adventure mode. ============== Game has a good look and feel, but not much else. The devs do NOT know how to balance, every new master + set of cards are overpowered because they are putting sales over quality of life. IE: Morella's dragon.  They are 90% autowin cards. The gameplay mechanics themself are terrible, you will often find yourself in a position where you just lost for 5 minutes straight as you can never get anywhere. Mana is extremely restrictive and makes hearthstone look like a balanced game.  There are a ton of useless cards that are over priced as well.  10 mana for a medium tank and maybe some archers who die instantly to aoe - vs a massive golem with tons of hp and a massive aoe swing. 9 mana golem - pretty much 1 shots everything...summon a 7 mana air unit that has knockback and high damage to counter?  Newp, because after you summon that there's not only a horde of minions coming your way the enemy master just got a free massive demon tank.  spawn some units to counter? Have them lightning bolted and killed. Summon the 7 mana ranged guy sooner you say?!  Sure.....and watch it get killed by a 5 mana ranged unit or 3 mana lightning bolt. and its 4 cards to a hand.....who is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idiot that decided a 4 card hand was an ideal number?? Its like they hired the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idiots from Blizzard that thought jade golems was a good idea. The matchmaking is even worse, they favor time over quality - often leaving you with a pug vs arranged team or against someone way to high for your level. I plan on uninstalling after I hit GM."
Minion Masters,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy, Free To Play",Really dont understand why there is no more people here ! This game is ten time above anything else of its kind.

Minion Masters,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy, Free To Play","Addictive fun that comes with a ""pay to progress (faster)"" system. If you don't spend money on this game than you reach your progress ceiling very easy, very fast. You need to have access to all the Masters, to stand a fighting chance and yes you need to pay hefty for that. You'll need rubies and shards and cards etc to build and buff your arsenal and yes you'll need to pay heft for that as well. If you choose not to pay then your progress will be hindered. You wil;l unlock cards much more difficult and slower and you Master options will be limited. That will make you lose a lot aof games and remain stuck in a rank for much longer than others that probably have paid what is asked to have all the options available. It gets a thumbs up from me as a game/concept and mechanics but a major thumbs down because of the greedy money grabbing system."
Minion Masters,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy, Free To Play",+It's free... -...but extremely pay to win
Minion Masters,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy, Free To Play","Feels like if you buy the wrong cards early, you're stuck beneath a massive grind to get anything else worthwhile - and that grind sucks if you picked the wrong cards. I prefer to experiment a bit with deckbuilders, and the complete unforgivingness of the purchase system makes that basically impossible. If you're going to play this, read online how you should spend your currency, this game punishes blind experimentation quite harshly."
Minion Masters,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy, Free To Play","Just the first hour in and it's been intriguing enough to keep me going.  It clearly shows how it contains pay to win mechanics for deck building, but I believe the matchmaking will do their best to match up equal power levels which turns it back into a skill/knowledge based game. I'll put in another hour and see how I feel.  So many games call for so much of our time these days..."
This War of Mine,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation",AMAZING and very touching game. Please buy it to support Ukraine even if you dont want to play. LONG LIVE UKRAINE !!!!
This War of Mine,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation",repetitive but good game overall and the idea that they can't get used to murdering people after the second or the third time is a deal-breaker because of its repetitiveness humans are highly adaptable in such conditions.

This War of Mine,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation",Fun game i enjoyed it really. Its something unique and the art and style too!
This War of Mine,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation","Immersive experience a heartwarming theme of service and sacrifice to help your group survive an urban warzone. It's a refreshing antidote to all the wargames and first person shooters. Forces you to slow down and focus on what's really important the essentials of Life. It's a refreshing antidote to the dopamine-overdosed 24/7 desensitized modern lifestyle. If you glorify battle and think fighting is cool, this reality simulation will prove to you that it isn't. If you feel powerful with a gun in your hand, and get off on it, feeling like a big macho winner, then this reality simulation will prove to you that there is more safety and security in building trust and creating a home than in destroying life and Creation. Glad to see this included in the public school classrooms, in Poland, and next in the whole world, we can only hope, especially in Russia, right?"
This War of Mine,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation","I refunded this game I kind of liked it, but not enough to want to keep it.  The atmosphere was great, but the gameplay felt  a little tedious I consider this a neutral review."
This War of Mine,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation","This is a really moving, yet at times depressing, game that is more relevant in my mind because of the current events in Ukraine.  I'm not sure what it is like to live in a war-torn city (and I hope to never know) but I believe the devs did a good job of trying to convey the times of problems citizens caught in a war have to face.   Food shortage, injuries, scavenging, depression, fear of other survivors who want to take your supplies, little comforts missing, fellow citizens who need help but you have limited resources yourself.   A lot of issues go on trying to survive.  I felt  a connection to my little avatars and a sadness when things didn't go the way I would have liked for them.  It was a good game with a sad premise.  But it did have an ending for me that wasn't all bad.  I hope your's is too!"
Inscryption,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy","This is 3x the game that ""The Legend of Bum-Bo"" wanted to be."
Inscryption,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy",Genial !
Inscryption,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy","Stoat: ""Oh come on......"""
Inscryption,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy","Tentative rating at 6.5 hours, I will update once I have finished it. I haven't seen the end yet, so I cannot be certain of this assessment.  But at least at this point this is easily the most creatively weird game I have played in years.  And that really is all I can say about it without potentially ruining it for anyone reading this.  As others have said, if it looks vaguely interesting to you, STOP LEARNING ABOUT IT.  Either buy it or don't buy it, but don't investigate it.  Every fact you learn about what happens within it will reduce your enjoyment of it. EDIT after completing the game. More games need to be like this. Completely unpredictable and also incredible fun"
Inscryption,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy",Just absolutely amazing
Inscryption,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy","Super cool game with a lot more to it than the simple trapped-in-a-room-card-battler that it presents itself as. Can't reveal much without spoiling it, so check it out if you want to play something very unique."
Inscryption,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy","Soon, hobo i will grace you with the completion of this game. You will be proud of me, unlike my totally real wife after i forgot to flush."
Inscryption,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy","Wow, a lot of work went into this fever dream of a game.  Recommend it if you like card/deck builder games because there is a lot of it in here."
Inscryption,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy",This is definitely one of those games where you shouldn't read the reviews and just pick up the game if it even remotely interests you. Like card games? Pick this up. Like games where things go crazy? Pick this up. Just do your best to avoid spoilers.
Obsidian Prince,"Indie, RPG, Strategy","Fun, crunchy and beautiful. What more could you want?"
Roll Player - The Board Game,"Casual, Indie, RPG, Strategy","Creating characters was always my favorite part of playing D&D. This game actually makes you smarter! Dice puzzle core mechanics, like Sagrada, but with medieval fantasy story theme! Satisfying on several levels! Love it!"
Roll Player - The Board Game,"Casual, Indie, RPG, Strategy",It's a good game
Solar Settlers,Strategy,"Wow!  I think this might be Brain Good Game's coolest game yet.  The premise is simple enough, in a tightly limited amount of X turns, you'll need to retire Y number of colonists to fun little habitats. Colonists are your bread and butter in this game, as they're the only ones that can gather the resources throughout the galaxy.  The catch being it costs resources just to move and maintain them, and if you settle a colonist, they're then out of action (kind of like dying for points). Another big factor in your success is maximizing the use of your hand of cards by strategically upgrading the various worlds you've uncovered.  These cards will usually have some restriction as to where they can be placed and often a cost in resources to create.  Even cooler, if hard up for a given resource, you can simply discard a card to get 1 of the resource indicated at the bottom of the card thus forcing tough calls as whether to save a card for later or just cash it in."
Solar Settlers,Strategy,"While this is the highest profile of the Brain Good board games, it's probably my least favorite because it seems to be the least challenging.  I bought all of their games together in a pack and very much enjoy them for their length and variety of ideas.  It is very much is like playing solo board game, and I'd recommend the pack to anyone.  I think maybe this one would have benefited from NOT being a solo game.   If you had go quickly because someone else was after the same resources, that would add a little welcome pressure to the proceedings.  But still it's an interesting set of mechanics and worth having to complete the set."
Runestone Keeper,"Casual, Indie, RPG, Strategy","Its a solid roguelike, but I don't feel like enough gets saved and moved over such that its not a massive grind."
Dorfromantik,"Casual, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",The fun of the classic board game Carcassonne like gameplay in a single player score chaser!
Dorfromantik,"Casual, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",good and relaxing
Dorfromantik,"Casual, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Amazingly zen puzzler.
Dorfromantik,"Casual, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Nice little board game
Rogue Empire: Dungeon Crawler RPG,"Indie, RPG",A very solid roguelike.  I think my favorite bit is how it handles level ups a lot like  a typical deckbuilding roguelike.
Duelyst,"Free To Play, Indie, Strategy","Edit (February 2024): Check Duelyst 2 and/or Cards & Castles 2 instead. --- Highly recommended!

Deathstate: Abyssal Edition,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG",Good goofy light auto-aiming twin-stick rogue fun.
Surviving Mars,"Simulation, Strategy","I was a click away from refunding it,   Decided to give it another go and glad I did.  A fun and compelling little game. if even just for a moment.. gives you hope that we have a better future than the clownshow of today."
Surviving Mars,"Simulation, Strategy",My go-to builder games. Made even better with the terraforming expansion.
Surviving Mars,"Simulation, Strategy","If they don't suffocate, they starve. Sorry, little colonists. I'm doing my best."
Surviving Mars,"Simulation, Strategy","Even though this game isn’t bad, it isn’t good either. Firstly, there wasn’t any content when they released the game. Then they added some content with a free update while selling DLCs. Since, Paradox Interactive is the publisher, there are a lot of DLC to milk their customers (some of these DLCs are required for achievements). The idea of space city building is great but sadly, there isn’t much to do in game. There aren’t many buildings, activities, aim or a motive to play. Developers designed the game with a drone workforce and since this workforce does most of the work, colonists, which you can’t set a specific number to stop them having a child (instead you have to choose yourself colony by colony), feel like a burden. For the positive parts, as you can see graphics are pretty good looking, the game has a great OST, even though it is pretty basic there is a try for partial story implementation, map choices with modifiers and challenges, skins (!) and I can’t say that I have encountered any bugs. The game was fun for me for a couple hours, after that it became a bit dull. Still, it is a mediocre game, not a bad game, and I gave it a thumbs down because of their content release style."
Surviving Mars,"Simulation, Strategy","Tried it out over the free weekend, I really wanted to like it, but I found it to be way more frustrating than fun. The UI is laid out in a very inefficient manner. Everything building related is buried in submenus, and things you only use very rarely like tech tree or going into graphs view have prominent always-on-screen buttons. The inconsistent function of buttons in the building info panels were equally frustrating - they're all the same size and shape and in generally the same location, but some are functionality toggles, some are upgrades, some are commands. The waiting period between first colonists arrival and being allowed to bring more in means you have a ton of time spent doing nothing because you quickly reach the point where you can't do anything else until you get more colonists. When starting out, before you're self sufficient, you have to spam ships from earth laden with stuff you need. Not only is it unsatisfying to feel completely dependent, but this adds to the general feeling of helplessness and boredom during the initial colonist waiting period. Once you're beyond the initial grind, and you start building your base, you'll quickly realize what an absolute pain in the ass it is to build anything. Some buildings have damage zones where they'll hurt other buildings that are too close. These zones do not show up when you go to put new buildings down, so you have to memorize the range and guestimate your placement. In order to exploit resources that are unreasonably spread out, you either have to build duplicates of every basic building or lay down tons of wire and pipes that block the hexes they're placed in. Drones don't just allocate themselves to where they're needed, you have to manually couple them to whatever control building can reach the jobs, even if there's overlap in the control area. In fact, why don't connected drone support areas form a mesh network? That would make sense, and more importantly wouldn't waste the player's time shuffling drones around. The drone issue is pretty typical of my problem with the game, it's unnecessarily tedious and focused on micromanagement of tasks that really aren't any fun. I don't want to manually reallocate super sad workers that are too dumb to swap jobs when there are better ones open, I don't want to be shuffling drones around, I don't want to have to constantly tell my mining truck to go find a new deposit, I don't want to have to memorize bad spots to build because the UI won't show me them while building, I don't want to spend the first 30-60 minutes shipping goods from earth while waiting to be allowed to import enough colonists to actually run the buildings that I can totally afford to build. It's like they took the most frustrating parts of Planetbase and Offworld Trading Company and Aven Colony, and wrapped it all in a bad UI."
Surviving Mars,"Simulation, Strategy","I loved this game absolutely, it's still a bit barebones but the upcoming content and workshop will soon make it even more glorious. Random events are fun, it's a big challenge to keep the colony going, needs your full undivided attention."
Surviving Mars,"Simulation, Strategy","I simply cannot play this game.  It is excellent for what it is, but it is literally unhealthy for me.  This game activates my ""just one more turn"" urge more strongly than any other game I have played, like 3 hours just melt away and I'm left wondering what the heck just happened and its 4 AM and I have a business meeting at 7 AM and oh man I am such an incredible idiot. I think I recommend it for others who have better self control than I do.  If you like sim-style games its hard to imagine this one won't be at least some fun.  But for myself, its bad.  Its the nicotine of games."

Pretty sure a slower reader would be somewhere here in 30 minutes. There's nothing captivating at this point. I am not going to waste my time with this. I have no interest iin playing something that looks like some random anime, no matter how different it would turn eventually. The game has to hook me from the start. This certainly doesn't."

Lethal Company,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Early Access",so funnny i lov so mucjh
Lethal Company,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Early Access","It is a pretty interesting idea and since I love looting, it was great for me. However, game is not really balanced and it feels a bit pointless after a while (no objective or a real target and there is danger of losing everything). Even with problems I have mentioned, game is pretty interesting and it is fun to play with friends. I would recommend using mods to make it better. I hope developers will add more interesting features and make the game more enjoyable in the future but this game deserves a try at least, even in this state, especially with this price."

Lethal Company,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Early Access",so much fun
Fights in Tight Spaces,"Action, Strategy","Pretty interesting concept with a fun playstyle for a short amount of time. Picking cards and building a deck for puzzle style levels are an interesting concept. However, I have to point out that there is a huge balancing issue, since some of the cards are useless and some of the side quests cannot be completed with different card selections. Also, randomization of everything is a really big problem like card shuffle, card choices or ability choices. If you do not have the right cards or you did not draw them, you can get hit at the first movement, no matter what you do. Unfortunately, there is no balance for bad luck which is a bit frustrating. Other than that, some cards weren’t explained clearly and trying to figure it out was a bit annoying. There are a lot of cards, decks and enemies though which is a plus. Music was fun at first but it gets annoying after a while, since there aren’t many songs. As you can imagine, there is no story and I do not think there is any need for that. To sum up, I think it is worth a try for several hours, especially with its price."
Fights in Tight Spaces,"Action, Strategy",Horrible
Fights in Tight Spaces,"Action, Strategy","An excellent deck builder game, sort of like a spy martial arts version of Slay the Spire.  I think I like it better than Slay the Spire, which is saying something since that game consumed me for about a full week."
Fights in Tight Spaces,"Action, Strategy","A very original tactical roguelike deckbuilder that does a good job of recreating fights in the style of the famous Indonesian martial arts film, ""The Raid"" or the train fight in the James Bond movie, ""Spectre"" (basically brutal hand to hand fights in cramp spaces)."
Max Payne 3,Action,BUYYYY IT!!!
Max Payne 3,Action,The best story driven fps game in history!! I have replayed the awesome an intense story 100 times with 100%completion! This game will be referenced in history and museums years to come.
Max Payne 3,Action,"This game saved my life. I am 22. My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old. When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide. After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side. Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labour"". I relaxed for 5 whole minutes to this music long enough to realise that I was going to be okay. After coming to that realisation, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as. Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends. I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together. Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realise that. Thank you"
Max Payne 3,Action,brazilians man
Max Payne 3,Action,it's really different from the first two and not necessarily in a bad way. it has some glitches and long loading times and the flashing in cutscenes give me headaches. but it's an action-packed game with the same old Max Payne poetry and charm. the shooting is simple but meaningful and fun especially when the game hits you with some good music. the story is average but satisfying enough with some really cool moments.
Max Payne 3,Action,The best third person shooter ever made.
Max Payne 3,Action,"really fun and satisfying shooting, my only downside is that there are too many cut-scenes (although the writing and performances are great) and a lack of exploration"
Max Payne 3,Action,best game ever
Max Payne 3,Action,Best way to learn how to take painkillers and dodge bullets
Max Payne 3,Action,"Whilst the story is fairly average this game has some of the best third-person shooting you'll ever experience. Replayability is stunted with un-skippable cutscenes but mods can fix that, apparently."
Spec Ops: The Line,"Action, Adventure",This game is very good and very sad 12/10
Spec Ops: The Line,"Action, Adventure","They told me this game had a ""deep, meaningful"" storyline, no it's a 3rd rate story that gives you no choices. It's a buggy mess with endless repetative action."

Spec Ops: The Line,"Action, Adventure",shooting unarmed civilians is based
Spec Ops: The Line,"Action, Adventure","Wait so was the 33rd real? Were Lugo and Adams real? Was the setting where Dubai is covered in sand real? Was it a dream? Was the CIA op real?

Was Gould real? Were the rest of the CIA from the intel real? Was any of the intel real? Was the radio guy real? Was Konrad really a Colonel that Walker knew from Kabul? Was the heavy enemy who looked like Lugo real? Was his appearance and subsequent disappearance after dying to him a sequence glitch in the game's coding, a deliberate narrative device, or a manifestation of Walker's guilt and inner turmoil? What was there for Walker to feel guilty of at this point when he's just been following his mission? Was the mannequin room real? Was this really a bad gameplay segment? Was the white phosphorous mortar segment real? If it was real, were we shelling the evil 33rd or was it civilians? Why does the dying soldier who looked like Obama say ""we were helping"" when they were literally committing genocide? Was the Obama soldier real? If the 33rd were real, were they killing real civilians? Was Lugo really hanged by a mob or did he hang himself? Did we really shoot into a crowd of civilians after they hanged Lugo? Was the argument between Lugo and Adams real? Was Riggs real? Was the argument between Adams and Walker real? Does Walker have schizophrenia? Did Walker skip his last medical? Was Konrad's corpse really sitting on top of that building? Did Walker really take the uniform off of a corpse and wear it? Was the ending cutscene real? Is Walker real?

Spec Ops: The Line,"Action, Adventure",Good game
Spec Ops: The Line,"Action, Adventure",Captures the brutal side of war so perfectly. There aint no winner or hero in the wars. Only the losers & victims.
Spec Ops: The Line,"Action, Adventure","if you want to feel like a piece of ♥♥♥♥, this is the game for you. you do some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up things, all in the name of making yourself look good, i did have some problems with the gameplay, but they were consistent issues which were trying to vault over cover sometimes is a pain in the ass the entirety of chapter 14 is pretty Garbo with the gameplay. but overall its a good time killer until chapter 8 where walker kills 47 innocent people and the rest of the game walker starts hallucinating that Konrad is still alive and he starts having these crazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ illusions. my personal favorites are the burning tower and welcome to hell walker. the game makes the choices flow seamlessly although sometimes it can be cryptic with it, but generally if you think you can do it it can probably be done like shooting in the air instead of shooting the civilians when Lugo dies, and shooting the snipers instead of one of the two dudes in the hanging dudes choice, but the very end of the game it reveals that Konrad has been dead the entire game. a huge plot twist that makes you realize that you destroyed a whole city for no reason. you are a monster, truly the only good ending is never playing it in the first place."

"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","Action, Adventure, RPG","Really missed these big, buff dude power fantasy games from back in the day, a real breath of fresh air. Campaign is alot of fun, especially played with friends in coop, operations is fun, and I'm having a great time in the pvp, though it could really use some more maps. Just overall a great time. Tons of great gore, action, beautiful graphics, good performance and great enemy/character designs."
"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","Action, Adventure, RPG","Choppy gameplay, choppy audio, choppy choppy. Im above the recommended specs. Wish I could get a refund"
"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","Action, Adventure, RPG","I have not played a game like this for long time. Game has great graphics, good story with great lore and atmosphere. Narrative style for the campaign can be text book level for this genre. Plus, this game can be the manliest game ever in the most positive way, you can feel the epicenes at a lot of scenes. Only problem was the last boss’ design (AI was problematic at high difficulty also) for some attacks. Also, game supports co-op at campaign and operations. Other than that, PVP is pretty decent with matches that you can easily find. Even though this is AAA, it is not overpriced like most of the AAA games. Looking forward for the third game!"
"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","Action, Adventure, RPG","""The Emperor Protects... My Sanity?!"" Recommended? 69/10!! I came for the chainsword, stayed for the existential crisis. In Space Marine 2, I learned three things: 1. Jumping into a horde of Tyranids isn't as cool when they can eat your face. 2. Space Marines are basically caffeine-fueled, walking tanks with a hero complex. 3. I’m probably not cut out to save humanity. The first mission had me feeling like a god among men, smashing through enemies like a sentient blender. But by the third mission, I’m pretty sure my character was just angry that he didn’t get enough sleep or coffee because we’ve been slaying xenos for weeks without a break. The dialogue is full of testosterone and random battle cries that make me question if Space Marines are secretly poets who hate rhyming. And let’s not forget that the chainsword is the closest thing to therapy in the 41st millennium. I’ve never felt so alive. It’s not all fun though. There was that one time I was so deep in combat that I accidentally started attacking my own team. Turns out, Space Marines don’t appreciate friendly fire. Who knew? Space Marine 2 is like a brutal workout for your thumbs and your soul. Come for the purging, stay for the crisis of faith. Final Verdict: If you like your enemies served extra crispy and your friendships strained by chaotic voice chats, this is your game. May the Emperor have mercy on your save files."
"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","Action, Adventure, RPG",It's very decent though I liked Space Marine 1 better
"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","Action, Adventure, RPG","Warhammer as a franchise has had many different takes and variations on the source material, with a lot of it usually falling into the same rhythm most of the time. However the original Space Marine title released in 2011 was a stand-out experience that sadly ended on a cliffhanger, with 2023's Boltgun serving as a shadow sequel to the former, but bow in 2024 we got the much anticipated follow up that despite everything it does right, had me feeling a little muddled in some parts. Space Marine 2 picks up two centuries after the originals bitter sweet ending, with Titus serving a self-imposed exile with the Deathwatch, and after nearly dying he is saved via the Rubicon surgery, going from an Astarte's to a Primaris, a major upgrade for himself. Now just like the previous game he leads a small squad against a Tyranid invasion with a lot of the previous games story beats coming full circle and honestly the story in this game is S-Tier, even though I'm not the biggest lore fanatic, having finished the prior game gives a lot of context that you will need, however the campaign for the most part is short, with some welcomed character appearances that I will not spoil. My biggest issue with the campaign is the lack of progression throughout the 8 hour romp of bug stomping fun. Don't get me wrong, the combat in this game is incredible, you really do feel like a walking tank with a conscious, but the variety of weapons, primarily Boltguns just all feel the same, and playing the game on a harder difficulty doesn't earn you anything special, however in conjunction with the main campaign you have Operations mode which puts you in the shoes of Titus's other battle brothers, performing tasks related to the main stories events which I find far more engaging as well as rewarding, even if it does get a little grindy after a while. Just having the feature to upgrade your equipment made it a far more rewarding from my perspective, you feel like your getting stronger through your hard work which is just top notch, and the inclusion of being able to change your chapter colors is also welcomed, especially when you can make your own custom armor setup, it just felt more engaging and personal to me, and this isn't a knock against the campaign, it was still a highly polished experience. The other mode to explore is the multiplayer which allows that same kind of customization as Operations, but new outlets have reared their ugly heads with complaints of the other Space Marine's feeling like paper, and listen I get it, the game is suppose to be a power fantasy with you being the ultimate weapon but not everyone can be damn near impervious, it would really muddle the experience and for the most part I don't mind this decision since you need to think about it from the context of the lore I suppose, these are Space Marine's, men with weapons that fire high yield explosives, so it would make sense that their weapons are effective against one another y'know? I really wish there was a horde mode like the previous game, and hopefully more Operations are added in the near future, because I feel the six missions already available might get a little old, or at least give us more opportunities to earn requisition points to help expediate the mundane grind. Overall the game is well crafted, but I would recommend waiting for a sale."

Dishonored®: Death of the Outsider™,Action,"It is much more like a DLC but it is not, because of the price of this “stand alone” game. Even though, it is really short, this one costs same with Dishonored 2. It is just a DLC actually, with the lack of the story for the most part, a couple skills without a development, same problems and no chaos system (it felt better without the chaos system though). With this price, it is definitely not worth it."

Destination Primus Vita - Ep. 1,"Adventure, Casual, Indie","It's tiny, teaser like story-oriented game. Because of the sales, probably there won't be other chapters and unfortunately this chapter is like an introduction, without the other chapters it is a bit meaningless. Developers are quick to respond and they are trying to help if they can. Characters of game are cliché but adequate and appealing at the same time. Story looks interesting but as i said it is only the beginning part of it. Puzzles are decent except the maze one. Failing it is tilting. I still don't know the logic of one symbol in it though. For science part, there are some inconsistencies but the other elements of the game make up for it."
SUPERHOT,"Action, Indie","Ugh... I so wanted to like this game too. The concept (time only moves when you do) is neat, but the execution is horrible. The game's biggest problem is that it is just super fickle. Enemies spawn from seemingly random locations, have unlimited ammo, shoot faster than you, and will shoot so wildly that you'll often dodge right into the bullet itself. You'll throw a weapon for it to disintegrate in thin air because it just clipped the edge of a wall. Or you'll die because a bullet from a far away enemy just happened to go through a window hitting you in the arm instantly killing you (your bullets through windows don't kill by the way). The level design is ultra frustrating where you'll be surrounded and just die over and over until you make the perfect play or the enemy's random bullet patterns just happen to miss you. Even when you succeed it doesn't feel like you've won. You're bombarded with random black and white screen flashes, replays are covered with ""SUPERHOT"" playing over and over, and some lame tacked on creepy pasta ""story"" about DOS and old school modems and stuff. Ultimately, the game boils down to you constantly just doing the same thing over and over. Shoot a few times, throw your weapon, stun an enemy, grab their gun. Rinse and repeat forever. Yawn. If the game is on sale for like $3 maybe look into it, but otherwise I'd give it a strong pass."
SUPERHOT,"Action, Indie","Gameplaywise Superhot one of the most innovative FPS games I’ve ever played. Slowing time and moving according to that with these mechanics fun. However, campaign is pretty short and challenges are just same levels with different conditions. Annoyingly you need to complete all of the challenges for 100%; so, it feels a bit grindy at that part. Other than that, playing challenges make you realize some of the mechanics aren’t well optimized. Still, it’s a decent shooter game. Game has a great setting like menu, apps, concept, group chat – which has great dialogues - etc. and details like typos in this group chat strengthens the immersion. Some of these lines at the group chat feels like real life conversations. In game teasing and writing-manipulation simile was a good thought.  Even it was short, I enjoyed the story (it’s too ambiguous sometimes unfortunately)."

Worms W.M.D,"Action, Strategy","EDIT: Now, after the recent price hike the game received in Brazil (And several third world countries), I no longer recommend this. Stay away from this game till they fix this ABUSIVE price. No Indie game should cost almost as much as a AAA game, which are already expensive enough."
Worms W.M.D,"Action, Strategy","Worms is a classic and it is a good game to spend time with friends. However, this Worms game does not have a lot variety and it is a bit expensive for 7 years old 2D game. Still it is worth a shot for some time, if you have money available."

Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden,"RPG, Strategy","Good gameplay, cool setting, neat dialogues and superb voice-acting. Thumb up."
Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden,"RPG, Strategy","I really wanted to like this game, but only 2 hours in and can't see playing any more of it.  It does some things really well; the art direction is great as is the voice acting.  But the tactical gameplay just leaves me cold; there seems to be none of the depth to it that I was hoping for.  Also, the third person wandering around feels like wasted time. I feel like this game would have been better if they had focused in on the tactical side and cut out the exploration bits, OR focused on the exploration bits and made it more of an RPG.  As it is...just not my thing."
Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden,"RPG, Strategy","Disappointing. Game is hard and you have to play sneakily to be able to progress. However, to be able to get experience and loot you will have to kill the separated enemies one by one with silenced guns; then clear the remaining enemies. There aren’t much variety to guns, upgrades, items and skills (you cannot select more than 3 skills for a character at the same time) to feel the progress or keep the game interesting. It gets repetitive and boring quickly. Even though graphics, drawings and the world seem pretty; story is not. Unfortunately, it is really dull and most of the time it is not even there. There are not many interactions with the world or any interesting events also."
DPS IDLE,"Casual, Indie, Free To Play","I just can't recommend in its current form. With this type of game, I'm used to to grind and resets.But, when I'm actively playing for 2 hours or coming back to it after 8, and there's no real progress, there's a problem. Chest costs are incremental, and you're at the mercy of RNG on whether you unlock a card or not. Upgrading a card re-locks the cards again (unless you pay premium), leaving you with the RNG again, assuming you can even afford to open the chest again. Guild system is confusing. You're just never sure which one you should use at a time. Heroes level so slowly, they're all but useless. Maybe the game get more interesting later with more unlocks. But it takes so long to get there, it's hard to care enough to find out."
Faeria,"Adventure, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Strategy","The game was beautiful and fun in the start, than they started putting everything behind paywalls without even the chance to grind it in any way. I have nice cards, but I cant use it anywhere without spending $$. But no clue why playerbase is so small."
Faeria,"Adventure, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Strategy","Early Access done right: Shape the game yourself! This is the first EA-Game ive played where the devs are really involved with the community and actively listen to balancing feedback. The main designer really likes to explain why he did something in-depth (example: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ynh9UYlz6F8U8Y5b8HSE8r0S7vIHwmqVOEFKDRnG0FQ/edit ) and usually hangs around the discord chat talking about cards. About the game: MTG meets Chess. Its a card game that plays on a board. At the beginning the board is empty. Each turn you place some lands. Then you summon creatures on the lands. Then you move your creatures to harvest faeria (the single ressource) or fight. Repeat. Also theres a lot of events (some are really mean). And theres structures (they cant move). Why this is good: Because of big plays. Other card games just dont compare. Move the enemy defender away from the opponents orb (the thing you need to destroy) with an event so you can move in and deal the last damage? Check. Turn your own creature into a cute frog that can jump, so you can jump over the enemy creature to play a land in his territory and then play a haste creature and kill him? Check. Play lots of 1/1 creatures in front of your orb and hold the enemy down? Check. Each game has its turnarounds and moments that make you just go ""wow"" and stare at the screen in love (or hate). And the best part: FREE TO PLAY! After the EA the game will become free. So why dont you try it?"
Faeria,"Adventure, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Strategy","Faeria is a suberb card/board game that has been under development for at least 5 years now. Couple years back Faeria existed as a web browser game, but out of the blue it disappeared for good couple years. But alas! Now Faeria is back with a new, smooth Steam early access client. And damn it's good! What's different in Faeria compared to other major digital card games: Permanent mana. No reset between turns. Players gain 3 mana per turn. Units are placed in a hex grid, which is empty at the start of the game, except the four faeria (mana) nodes Players control the map by summoning either two neutral lands OR one land of the four elements that act as thresholds for cards (neutral cards do not need any, but are weaker stat wise) Units can only be cast on land you own. If the creature (structures can be built anywhere) requires certain element, it has to be cast on a hex where the corresponding land type matches Positioning matters on the hex grid. Line of sight: Ranged attacks are blocked by friendlies (no ff, but you cannot shoot through them). Movement: Flying creatures can move on any tiles. Movement: Aquatic creatures can move on tiles that have no element (considered sea) OR lake (one of the four elements) cast on them. 30 card deck with 3 copies, 1 if legendary. What's similar to others: 1vs1 obviously Permanent damage (no healing between turns) Summoning sickness on creatures and structures 20 health on players - win condition is to reduce this to 0. Milling doesn't seem to exist in the core set. --- Upsides Aesthetics. Looks and sounds great! Depth & complexity in gameplay mechanics and deck building Rewarding is pretty decent (10 wins per booster) + daily quests Players can pay 49,99€ for all the cards (x3) in the core set if they so choose Downsides No filters in deck builder Minor UI/UX annoyance: Players cannot see the buffs/debuffs/effects that are cast on the cards. Just the current numeral stats and default text. Minor UI/UX annoyance: When deck has 30 cards, players cannot see card rarities on collection any longer. The rarity icon is replaced by a lock. Balance issues: One turn finisher decks are what people seem to go for. To be blunt, it's damn boring. Control seems quite hindered. You'll like Faeria over Hearthstone if: You're looking for more depth/complexity You're looking for a more skill involved game Faeria and SolForge are the two card games that are actually worth playing online. Both have great rewarding even as F2P. Don't skip this one! -Artifex 28 @ Soundcloud [www.soundcloud.com]"

I love the story and idea behind it, it has great elements in it but I can't suggest these remastered versions to anyone while there is an AMD issue. The game can't load the textures and there can be save bug sometimes. So it's is way buggier the originial version. I prefer first game to second because of the story and depth of characters but it is still a great game and making the player a big daddy is a pretty good idea.

God of War,"Action, Adventure, RPG","One the greatest action games I have ever played. The characters were so good with great layers and their development with the unfolding of their stories were a magnificent experience for me. Story and narrative style of the game were perfect with Mimir, conversations between father and son, interactions, child’s growing up or a father’s growing up, and naturality of the all. Also, Baldur’s story is one of my favorites in mythology which was a great part of the game. As you can see that the graphics are pretty good. As for gameplay mechanics, it starts a bit slow with limited move set but with a little progress you and boy open new skills and gameplay gets richer. Stagger effect was a bit annoying for me, since the enemies do not get staggered easily, while I was being staggered at every hit but you get used to after a bit progress. Atreus’ playstyle as a support character is greatly implemented with a parallel narrative to the story and gameplay without a problem which I thought it was really original. However, I would not recommend the hardest difficulty; because a god feels a bit too weak against regular enemies in that mode and you cannot change the difficulty which makes the side lands pretty obnoxious. I hope that expansion of this one and the previous games comes to PC without further delay."

Lara Croft GO,Adventure,"Lara Croft Go is surprisingly thematic; Solving the various tombs feels reminiscent of the classic Tomb Raider adventures, if - necessarily - more limited in scope and gameplay than the classics. While not boasting many enemy types, for example (and I would certainly have liked seeing a bear in here!), they are made to be intuitive to navigate around while solving puzzles. Only the DLC let me down a tad here, as the missions present different environments that may easily have swapped more than an enemy's paintjob. However, none of this took away from the fun of the game; it just made me wonder what could have been improved or expanded on, had it been a PC title initially, rather than developed for touch devices. Speaking of touch, the controls take a bit of getting used to. Most of the time I was dragging my mouse in the movement directions, which was totally fine for me (though a gamepad may have been smoother), but moving pillars would still require clicking little arrows next to them (which, in at least two instances early on, I almost didn't notice), and in stressful puzzles, you may end up accidentally swiping the mouse to move Lara accordingly, just to realize you didn't take the pillar with you and will have to start over from the last checkpoint. It's a relic of the launch platform that may have been made more intuitive for PC use. For reference, the gamepad controls would have you hold Y / Triangle while moving in the desired direction. Generally, I was surprised by the lack of use for the right mouse button. Interacting with the environment may have made more sense using that, especially if it is just flipping a lever on your current space. However, as negative as it may sound, these were only small hurdles to adjust to initially, and thoughts on how a good game could have been made to feel more natural on the PC platform. I don't intend them to turn you off from giving the game a try, but to prepare you for the first few levels before you're used to them. Things work out relatively quickly. The puzzles themselves range from easy to rather challenging, with only a few real trial and error ones in here, which is cool to see. Moving a bunch of pillars in a confined space to shuffle them into the right order certainly took the longest for me, though I was able to do so without enemies in said puzzle room. Generally, your options are well-limited to not confuse you too much, with decoys being easily discernible if you stop to think - which the game allows you to do even with a boulder rolling towards you. To my surprise, I didn't feel less threatened by those boulders, lizards or the giant boss of the main game, just because I could stop and hold, as enemies and traps only react when Lara does. They still add a good deal of pressure to not screw up your next steps and think on your feet. The tools at your disposal are always clearly visible on the current screen, too. Honestly, I don't think there was a puzzle room in here that I was really frustrated by, even though some had me stuck a bit longer than others. The developers managed to put together an intuitive puzzler here, which I applaud. As a bonus, you can also collect various doodads throughout the levels, with each act granting a costume from the Tomb Raider series; whether you want the Angel of Darkness design or Wetsuit Lara, the game's got a wide range of low poly style player character models to unlock. It's a nice touch for fans of the wider franchise, if a bit finicky to find all those gempots sometimes. Thankfully, you can easily see and select missions you missed something at. Overall, I'm pleasantly surprised by Lara Croft Go, and can appreciate the wealth of positive coverage it has gotten since release. Yeah, I'd agree that this was one of the actually good mobile games at the time, and am happy to see it on PC as well. If you're into puzzle games, you should consider picking this one up."

After learning how to play it properly, I actually rather like re6 now. Still prefer the weapon upgrade system in this over that but being able to dodge attacks whenever you want instead of annoying qte's is a definite improvement over this game."
Resident Evil 5,"Action, Adventure",nice game
Resident Evil 5,"Action, Adventure","Resident Evil 5 has got to be one of my most played games in the series (I played it mostly on the PS3). I still have fond memories of me and a buddy mindlessly murdering...uh...zombies. Yeah we'll go with zombies. But all things considered I feel like this game was the eventual downfall towards the more action orientated games in the series. Yes Resident Evil 4 ditched ""zombies"" for infected villagers and cultists. Yes Resident Evil 4 had a lot of action fueled moments that you would probably see in a cheesy 80s adventure flick. But you know what that game didn't have? Chris Redfield punching boulders while looking like one of the most juiced up gym jockey's known to man. Sometimes I wonder what this game would have been like if they stuck with the original concept (it was suppose to be a lot like RE4) but y'know having a trailer where a lone buff white dude shoots black people with shotguns and handguns is definitely not a good way to win over the public. But I will say this. If you're looking for a co-op Resident Evil game where you and a buddy can mindlessly murder infected ""people"" then by all means give it a whirl."

Munin,"Adventure, Casual, Indie","I generally like this sort of game and was enchanted by the graphics, but there are better games of this nature out there, and I don't feel like this one particularly distinguishes itself.  I think if it had had a story to pull you through, I would have like it more, but what little there is is very besides the point.  Also, maybe it's my computer but some of the time my jump command doesn't make it through or is a bit delayed.  Having to restart a level because of that certainly soured my experience and sure affects my review.  In general the platforming works a bit like Braid or older click and create games and doesn't have that smooth feeling you expect from a retail game."

Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game,RPG,"Although a bit dated (at least when playing the vanilla version), Fallout puts Role Playing in the RPGs with how you're thrust into the Wastelands. Minimal hand holding and yet not brutally hard gameplay, more than one way to solve quests (with possible different consequences depending on whick one you choose), truly one of the best RPGs out there."

Sniper Elite 3,"Action, Adventure","I had way worse memories about Sniper Elite 3 than I had playing it today, quite possibly due to playing it in the Xbox360, which was a very bad version of the game. SE3 was the one I considered the worst, but it is just as good as SEV2, campaign is very competent and the game evolved much more than I remember. I do miss the finger shots, but the scope shot they added is... MWA! Xray cam saw some massive improvements. The DLC missions are ok'ish, did not change my life but they were fun."
Sniper Elite 3,"Action, Adventure",perfect game
Sniper Elite 3,"Action, Adventure","Good game but constantly crashes and they couldnt formulate a solution to this since 2015 as I see from forum comments and such. Too bad, wasted my money."
Sniper Elite 3,"Action, Adventure",Very Good Game!
Blackguards,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy","I can't understand the bad reviews.  This is everything I want in a tacticle RPG game.  Every combat is a unique experience, often with puzzles for you to figure out to make things easier.  The story is interesting, with fun twists, the dialogue is well-written.  I particularly love the static town screens so that you don't have to talk to every uninteresting twit there to make sure you haven't missed anything.  My only slight negative is that the upgrade system is rather complicated, and I had to restart the game once after I figured it out."
Blackguards,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy","First: Blackguards isn't bad or good.  It's just extremely mediocre.  If you're into D&D alternatives and dig X-Com, it probably won't waste your time.  But I can't recommend it for most people. The character customization is surprisingly lacking, despite the illusion of choice.  There are twice as many attributes as a D&D system, but they all just sum together to increase your attack, dodge chance, initiative, etc.  There are only a handful of combat abilities to use, so there's not a lot of choice as far stabbing/shooting.  The magic users are more nuanced; there are a ton of spells, each with 4 tiers, so you're constantly weighing the cost/benefit of those. Combat itself is very similar to X-Com or D&D 4.0: you get either a move and an action, or a double move.  This all occurs on a hex-grid, and most maps have some sort of interactable element to spice it up.  They do an admirable attempt to differentiate the levels, but you will take place in about a billion combat scenarios, so a lot of them inevitably feel repetitive.  You'll probably be skipping side quests by the end out of boredom. The plot is pretty linear.  There are batches of side quests that open up at various points, but none of them augment the main plot line at all.  It's your typical RPG ""save my daughter"" or ""escort my caravan"" kind of stuff.  You become enslaved and forced to fight in a gladiatorial arena at one point, so that's pretty neat."
Far Cry® 2,Action,"The far cry franchise will forever remain weird to me, because my introduction to the series was FC2, objectively it was the ""thing"" that is not like the others Today, to me FC2 is nothing but a nostalgic flashback to one of my most fond periods in gaming, the late 2000s, it takes a lot of messing with the settings for modern hardware. You can't run the game over roughly 85 fps or everything starts bouncing.. and the mouse sensitivity almost never feels right.  But it's a cool little time machine game. That being said. Stop buying far cry games. Stop doing business with ubisoft. They've ruined everything they touched"
Far Cry® 2,Action,"Although I don't particularly like the story in this game the game play is ahead of it's time with weapon jamming and the option to let friendly npcs die to save medicine, also the amazing pc melting fire effects and a cool touch is having to use an actual map to navigate around the map."
Far Cry® 2,Action,"Far Cry 2 was one of my favorite games of the late 2000s. I wouldn't call it an immersive sim but it almost felt like one from time to time even if you weren't doing anything extra-curricular such as gambling, drinking, or playing mini-games. The games HUD is next to nonexistent and you play as a ""nameless"" mercenary (even though you choose someone from a menu of characters) who's caught in a civil war between two factions in Africa. It almost feels at times like it was inspired by a fistful of dollars since you play for both sides with a singular goal of making money and hunting down a notorious arms dealer. Granted for the time FC2 did some impressive things regrading fire simulation and also grossing players out with the trademark healing animations but I do have some gripes in regards to the combat. It often feels stiff and rigid lacking impact for shot fired and again to hark back to it trying to feel ""immersive"" your weapons do degrade overtime and will eventually begin to jam on you but more importantly explode in a comical yet horrifying manner that would leave any normal person with filled britches. It's certainly a manic joy ride of fire and hot brass but compared to the follow ups I feel like the game is painfully dated but I still have a soft spot for it. If you can get past the slow intro that would make Half-Lifes tram sequence seem bearable I feel like you can really enjoy this game for what it set out to do."
Far Cry® 2,Action,old and buggy but still fun
Far Cry® 2,Action,malaria
Far Cry® 2,Action,"Far Cry 2, this debt with my past is finally paid. Incredibly, this is the most technically advanced game Ubisoft has released, and honestly, one of the most advanced games ever made. The physics, the graphics, the FIRE (MY GOD THE FIRE), the gunplay, the animations, the foliage, wind, it's just superb and it aged like fine wine, does not feel dated at all. Far Cry 3 and 4 albeit more fun games, are way less impressive than Far Cry 2 was and still is to this day. It's not all flowers and sunshine tho, FC2 can be a boring videogame at times, especially if you consider where the series went in the future. Far Cry 2 is more akin to Far Cry 1, less story, less talking, more gameplay, more immersive, it makes you feel like you are a mercenary working for both sides of an ugly conflict and profiting for it while Afrika's people bleeds, and while the writing is very confusing and the motivation of MC less clear than petroleum, I still had a lot of fun with it. In the end Far Cry 2 did not became my favorite in the series, that still is Far Cry 4, but I really wish the devs took the technology further instead of castrating it in future iterations. It's a good game, impressive technical aspects and good shooting, but it will not change your life that much, still WAAAY better than Far Cry 5 and New Dawn that's for sure. P.S: I played this game using the mod ""Vanilla + (Tom's Mod)"" from Nexus Mods. It removes the ugly filters and has some quintessential balance changes, QoL and fixes, also, it's heavily customizable for your own liking. Definitely download this mod, it will make your life much better without ruining the original experience."

Call of Juarez: Gunslinger,Action,"I've been playing this game since the Xbox 360 era and this game is still extremely fun. The duels especially are a cool idea and they are really fun to do. The story is pretty good and the game play is great, all the guns sound great and head shots in this game are very satisfying."
Call of Juarez: Gunslinger,Action,Haven't played it for too long but so far i dig the mass killing and story telling.

Call of Juarez: Gunslinger,Action,One of the best games i have ever played
Call of Juarez: Gunslinger,Action,"A rare good quality western game with arcade shooter style. Story, graphics and sound design is pretty good. Overall, game is enjoyable except one annoying game mechanics: Duelling system. Duelling system is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it feels like a chore. Controls don’t make any sense (at least at keyboard and mouse). Sadly, the last duel was the worst and almost made me quit the game. However, other than mentioned mechanics of the game, it was a fun experience."
Call of Juarez: Gunslinger,Action,"Call of Juarez gunslinger is the most awesome fps game.Seriously l never thought that Techland would give this game for free.Which is cool before playing gunslinger l already played call of Juarez and Call of Juarez bound in blood which are good too.Story is fantastic as always and the twist are also damn awesome! in this game you play as a badass bounty hunter(who's name l probably forgot again).Gunslinger gives you the best fps experience of the Wild West and many more things l will suggest all those people who claimed this game to give it a try, believe me it's a really good game.My rating Call of Juarez Gunslinger would be 8/10!"
Call of Juarez: Gunslinger,Action,VERY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
Call of Juarez: Gunslinger,Action,"Nice little alternative to RDR, the collectibles and skills make this game very replayable. Not to mention the story, it describes showdowns with the old west's most famous gunslingers and outlaws. The combat was really fun and satisfying, especially the duels. I got this on sale but, honestly, I would have paid full price for it. (sales are very common for this game though)"

Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor took me by surprise. The game was really enjoyable. Enjoyed every bit of it. Middle-Earth Shadow of War takes everything done right from shadow of Mordor and improves it by an unexplainable margin. The story starts right after the ending of Shadow of Mordor. The ring maker and Talion (The main character) have forged a new ring, which attracted some new foes and friends. The story was rich and was enjoyable. They have improved the story. Completely different direction. Most of the gameplay aspects stayed the same, but some new ones were added which enriched the gameplay even more. The animation and gameplay felt more fluent and cleaner than Shadow of Mordor. Surprisingly,  The famous nemesis system got a HUGE BUFF. It was a really interesting and fascinating invention/system in the shadow of Mordor, But it truly shines in Shadows of War. No wonder why did, Wb patented it. It's MAGNIFICENT. Truly and worthy selling point. The combat of this series is a mixture of the Batman Arkham series with the assassin creed. Surprisingly It's stealth mechanism and gameplay is way way better than the whole assassin's creed franchise. XD Nemesis system spices things up since every orc you encounter has a different personality, different weaknesses different strengths which makes every encounter memorable, challenging and new. It's not just beat them up, it's thinking and dominate. You could spend hours playing the game without getting tired. Sometimes you will make your foes run away and sometimes your foes will make you run away. Sometimes it feels like you're playing as DARTH VADER in the lord of the ring universe (literally). The visuals were superb. The whole world-building was extraordinary. The game has 5 regions where the shadow of Mordor only had 2. All of the 5 regions are different from one another. All of them are filled with non-repetitive activities. (depends on perspective) One is a forest base where another one is located near a volcano. Swapping out one region to another is a refreshment. New visuals new challenges in each region. As I said the game is full of activities. It will take a pretty decent amount of time to finish. If you just want the story then it will take around 30 to 40 hours. But if you want full completion then it's more than 80 hours of gameplay. Cherry top on all of these is that this game has online PvE. Meaning it's endless. I aimed for completionist and it took 100hours! And I didn't even realize 100 hours have passed, it's that good. The value for money is unimaginable, even 60/70$ games don't have this much content nowadays. The end game meaning the shadow wars might get a bit grindy. But it is necessary to get the true ending. One which connects with Lord of the ring directly. Did face some bugs but they were one time only, so nothing to worry about. So if you couldn't tell already I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO EVERYONE."
Middle-earth™: Shadow of War™,"Action, Adventure, RPG",Great game. Holds up well even five years after release. Nothing like spending an hour or two killing some orcs. Also plays great on the Steam Deck with little customization (although I'd recommend medium settings on 40 fps and refresh rate for battery life).
Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30™,Action,"Not as good as Call of Duty 1/2 or the earlier Medal of Honor games but it is still good. Tactics are basic, AI is a bit stupid at times and the story is a little directionless but it is worth $2."
Titanfall® 2,Action,the most immersive game i have ever played and also its basically a mech anime
Titanfall® 2,Action,BT is a based gigachad
Titanfall® 2,Action,"Great campaign, and one of my favourite if not my favourite FPS game of all time. Sadly, the multiplayer has been neglected and is now overran by hackers that keep DDoSing the servers, so if you wanna play, get the Northstar client from GitHub which is really easy to install and it is made by the community that constantly adds new game modes, anti cheat and security, custom servers + browser and everything is unlocked for you."
Titanfall® 2,Action,Gimme titanfall 3 or a titanfall one and two combined remaster with all the content in one place.
Titanfall® 2,Action,"Titanfall 2 is an easy recommendation, especially for fast-paced FPS fans. The campaign is short yet sweet. But make no mistake, this will challenge you continuously throughout its campaign, making sure that you exploit the mechanics they give. This exploitation is pertinent as early in their tutorial, wherein they set the campaign difficulty based on how fast you finish their course. Buy it on sale just for the campaign, and you won't regret it. BT-7274 <3 Sad to say, I cannot attest to the multiplayer aspect of it. I only played for the campaign."
Titanfall® 2,Action,Titanfall 3 pls
Titanfall® 2,Action,I can't express how amazing and underrated this game is. such a shame that it's dying and EA does nothing to stop that...
Titanfall® 2,Action,EA is the only reason I dont play this amazing game still. Launcher is an absolute crutch
Titanfall® 2,Action,I used to have this on PS4 but just bought it a second time on Steam and there's a reason for that. This is probably the best FPS made in the past decade. One of the best campaigns I've ever played in a FPS game. Isn't bland like COD or Battlefield campaigns. Has characters that you actually care about. The multiplayer is extremely fast paced and fun. Don't have to worry about annoying campers (like the two most recent COD games) because the game encourages movement. Amazing game 100% get this (if it's on sale).
Titanfall® 2,Action,jeps best fast
Dead Rising 4,Action,"Well, as far as it goes for gameplay, it's pretty repetetive hack and slash like the typical DR1 but it has a variety of weapons AND creations. So, basically, to me its a DR 3 reboot but with DR1 as a reminiscent hook to keep playing If you love  the Dead Rising Series, give her a buy, I mean, the inner 2006 DR fans wanna know what happened to Frank West!"
Dead Rising 4,Action,"My score 6.5/10, mediocre but not as bad as you might think. Pros: - An overall fun open world game that kept me coming back for more. - I know everyone loved the timers and I get why they liked them, but I enjoyed being able to take my time in this one and not have to deal with a timer. - Didn't deal with any bugs (aside from a big one I will explain below) or frame rate drops. - Fun zombie gore. Cons: - Freezed at least once every day I played this game, usually within the first 20 minutes of starting or on the initial load screen. I only noticed that this would happen once and then upon rebooting the game it wouldn't happen again. However, it was extremely annoying to have to alt+F4  every time and hope it had auto saved if you were in the middle of game play when it happened. - I disliked how they went even more over the top and silly with this game (think Saints Row 4). I understand that this series always had a sense of silliness and over the top feel, but this one went too far. Sometimes almost giving it a sense of light heartedness imo. - Maniacs were boring and not memorable at all. - The last case or two weren't as fun as the rest of the game and the final boss battle was lame and repetitive. - Also, the ending felt abrupt and I don't feel like dishing out another $10 for a mediocre dlc that completes the story."
Dead Rising 4,Action,It's a little expensive but it's immensely fun. I love playing it just to let steam out and the easter eggs and jokes are cracking me up along the way.
Dead Rising 4,Action,brainz
Dead Rising 4,Action,"Dead Rising 4 is a weird, strange, buggy, but fun game. As a Dead Rising fan, this is a complete disaster, just a watered down version of Dead Rising 3. Some of the things added are pretty cool, and the combat is the best it's always been, but this is the weakest entry in the franchise, by far. But hey, if you look into the perspective ""Zombie game"", yeah it's fun. Kinda like DmC: Devil May Cry was a great game but not a great Devil May Cry. Not a bad game, just a bad Dead Rising."
Dead Rising 4,Action,"The bad reviews for this game are propaganda. This is a great game, I got the full version with all DLC for only 10$ on steam sale. It's well worth 10$ if you are a fan of the other dead rising games on steam. They changed the voice actor for Frank, but you'll get used to it quickly"
Frozen Synapse,"Indie, Strategy","I love this game! No luck, simple mechanics but loads of strategy. A pretty easy game to get your head around (I recommend looking up a combat guide or game mechnics wiki as some aspects are not clear in game) but bloody hard to master. A really simple concept that creates a guge amount of tension. Seems like a lot of players have dropped of, maybe in favour of Frozen Synapse Prime, so finding a game to play then and there can be hard depending on when you log in. That said, there is no issue with playing a game for a few minutes every day over a couple of various games you have going, so long as they finish! Awesome game that will have you thinking and there's endless replay value to be had here. There is nothing better than outsmarting the person becasue you knew they would know that you knew they would know what you were going to do and catered for that with a stragtegic move from hell! Man that feels good. 10/10"

THIS IS S**T dont buy it."
Monster Train,Strategy,"There's a reason this game is so highly rated. If you like deck builders at all, you owe it to yourself to check this one out."
Monster Train,Strategy,An amazing hybrid of a Slay the Spire like deckbuilder with a Tower Defense game!
Monster Train,Strategy,"I played this roguelite cards battler on various platforms, gamepass pc ,xbox and steam, and its a great game. Fun. For me the progression of the game is really good, while you play more you unlock fun other stuff. The combinations are a blast, you can make over the top OP cards. I like the sounds when the train is totaly full and your cards all packed with buffs, the sound is not beautiful, but catching, and I like the raw sound of the abilities clashing into each other. Its cool and easy to play some rounds, make comobs and have fun. Game is fun and well made, for sure worth your time"
Monster Train,Strategy,"Of all the games that have tried to offer content similar to Slay the Spire, Monster train is the one that, in addition to respecting its elder, has been able to improve it, based on the original ""draw 5 / 3 mana / battle"" format. The game is extraordinarily replayable and the cards and clans are well-balanced. Instead of other ersatz that have copied but never equaled StS, Monster Train has extracted the best from it to offer us a game just as addictive. Let yourself be tempted!"
Monster Train,Strategy,"This game was a surprise hit for me. I just happened to catch a Let's Play of it on YT and decided it looked interesting. So I get the game, play it for a while, end my session and look at the time. 8 hours. I played the game 8 hours on my 1st playthough. That's how much fun I was having. Good thing it was my day off. So what is so special about the game? 1. The factions you play as actually play different. And the fact you can mix and match by choosing a sub faction to supplement your deck means there are an almost endless amount of strategic oppurtunities. 2. The flow of the game is perfect. There are 3 levels of play, it's sort of a tower defense in this way. But turn based rather than real time. You have to plan out how to kill or weaken the enemies enough that they can't get through all of your defenses. The spells help a lot with certain factions to even the odds on harder waves. 3. Progression is fun. Unlocking things in roguelikes/roguelites is hit or miss. This game hits it. You are always unlocking more things. And everything you unlock improves your next playthoughs. It's exciting to find out what you will get next. 4. Enemies are varied. Not only that, bosses have multiple forms. One of the stage 3 bosses for example has a time bomb. And depending on the interation of the boss, the bombs can hit twice, they can have a damage shield that makes it harder to get rid of, or other things. 5. There's more to it than the regular game. There's a daily challenge where you go for top of the leaderboards with set penalties and boons that everyone has. The factions, starting decks, and rules are the same for everyone so it's a matter of how good you use it rather than who is the highest level in the game. 6. It can be insanely hard, for those who like that. Like Slay the Spire, you can make the game harder through tiers that add rules as you progress making it almost impossible to win unless you really know the ins and outs of the game. I personally stick with the base difficulty, but I can see how this would add hours to someone's enjoyment of the game. Cons? I guess the fact that each game can take near an hour could turn some people off. Also, it's not an easy game even at base difficulty. But if you're a fan of rogue games, you probably like it hard anyway. Honestly, it's a near perfect experience. It rivals Slay the Spire as the best roguelike/rougelite on Steam."
Monster Train,Strategy,Really addictive and fun dream quest-alike.
Monster Train,Strategy,Great ! Better than STS.
Monster Train,Strategy,"Three rows of brutal demon vs angel combat. The deckbuilding layer is comprehensive and lends itself to interesting inter-faction combos and some solid long-term decision making. The strategic side is tight and well-designed, with crisp animations of your demons crushing their angelic enemies (hopefully). The overmap is well-designed: you can see ahead of you an infinite amount so if you're into planning (I am not) then you can map out your every move. All of your rewards are randomized, so typically you really just need to pick left or right path, and you gain the three little perks of that side. It ties together seamlessly, and I want to have a special HUGE SHOUTOUT to the world design team and the writers. The world is always in the background, told through flavor text on enemies, artifacts, and items. Most things, really. Everybody's got a little backstory, and it ties together beautifully. The world feels alive and vibrant in a way that you don't often see in video games. The Melting Remnant is my favorite- a faction of candle-folks who melt away and are reborn again. The cards depict a society that's rough but hopeful, equal parts oppressed and oppressive. Anyways, it's a hell of a game. My gaming time is tight and I love games that let me get right to the good stuff, and this is that. There's a lot of game here. You should check it out."
Monster Train,Strategy,"Monster Train is an extremely addictive deck building roguelike. Pick one of 10 unique heroes, choose one of 5 allied clans, and off you go. You play as the bad guys and your objective is to defend the last train to hell from waves of invading heroes. Each wave becomes more difficult, but rewards you with extra cards, credits and possibly some magic artifact. In between waves you get ample opportunities to add or remove cards, repair your train, boost cards or buy artifacts. Each run feels different, there is a daily challenge with run modifiers, you can setup your own custom challenge, and there are end-game objectives aplenty. I like everything about this game, both art and gameplay are very much my cup of tea. If you love(d) Slay the Spire, I think this game can scratch that same itch while at the same time being very different. 10/10 for me, easy recommendation. I even voted for this game to be Game of the Year in the 2020 Steam awards!"
Monster Train,Strategy,Slay the Spire 2.0 with great art style and unique tower defense-esque mechanics.
Do Not Feed the Monkeys,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Nope
Do Not Feed the Monkeys,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy","An indie game with resource management and puzzle mechanics. It is a pretty simple game as mechanics and the game is mostly about peeping monkeys and solving their puzzles with the information you have seen. While some of the dialogues and interactions are funny, some of them have decent writing. I enjoyed at the writing room especially, maybe because I studied comparative literature too. There are some details which put a smile on your face like self-improving book, foreign language interactions and the game making fun of AAA games. Difficulty is like an RPG game, hard at the beginning, easy after the mid-game. Sound effects are a nice touch and annoying at the same time. Because no one likes the sound coming from other apartments. Other than that, there were only two bugs I have seen and they were fixed after restarting the game."
Crawl,"Action, Indie, RPG","Probably one of the best local multiplayers in gaming history. Awesome, awesome stuff. PvP with a campaign and a twist. Mix of a roguelite, ARPG where both players attempt to slay the same boss. The twist is - only one player can be the hero. Other controls the monster(s) and traps. As you kill the hero as monsters, you'll turn the human instead. Players can attempt killing the boss at level 10. Trick is, you only gain XP as human. As the player delves deeper in to the dungeons, both players get to upgrade their unique monsters and are forced to make choices on how to level up them as well. The game has surprisingly much complexity, considering the controls have just movement, ATTACK and SPECIAL buttons. Add randomized gear/trinkets/spells, and trikle gorgeous pixel art & animation on top. It even sounds awesome. Highly recommended!"
This Is the Police,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy",i give it a meh/10
Children of Morta,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG","I'm loving this new Family Trials mode!  It really comes off as a clever hybrid of classic Children of Morta gameplay in a more streamlined Slay the Spire roguelite campaign.  There is no story to bother with, just chose a character and endure as many trials and tribulations as you can, gaining powerful new abilities as you progress to the tougher stages.  Once you die you'll lose everything except, via some achievements (like killing X bosses, clearing the game with all family members, etc.) you'll unlock permanent little upgrades for all of the family members' future runs."
Children of Morta,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG","Pixelart, wholesome, dungeon crawler. Love it."
Children of Morta,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG","Children of Morta is a very well crafted roguelite. Somehow they managed to make all characters feel good, balanced and fun to play, it also has some of the most beautiful pixel art I have ever seen, beautiful arts and incredible animations, great responsive combat, fun story and good soundtrack too. Overall, it is easy to recommend Children of Morta is you are into roguelites. Nothing matters more than FAMILY - Diesel, Vin... Probably."
Children of Morta,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG","This game is ""beautiful"", but I wish they had spent more money on the actual gameplay. The auto-aim ignores nearby creatures (and thus misses them), the dodge is wonky and the RPG-elements are mostly temporary (How I wish to get permanent multi-shot..). Note: Singleplayer review, I guess as Co-op this game can be very fun."

Saints Row 2,Action,Very fun game.
Saints Row 2,Action,Horrible. Crashes always and laggy as hell
Saints Row 2,Action,"I'd really only reccomend this game to those who have played it before on a console, those who dont like the controls of a console controller.  The reason being is because SR2 PC is very fussy with PC specs, and could take you up to an hour to get a graphics option set that runs smoothly, that being said. the game is a console port. But I enjoyed the game enough on console to pay a few bucks for it on PC. Since I dont touch my Xbox anymore"
Saints Row 2,Action,its cool
Saints Row 2,Action,"Saints Row 2 to me is a near perfect sequel to a game that was often and unfairly compared to GTA. Yes it is a open world crime game involving gangs and hostile takeovers but you know what I feel like SR2 does a lot of thing better than GTA. Unlike the later games in this series SR2 has a grounded sense of humor that doesn't rely on the exaggeration. It has a lot of heavy hitting moments that remind you that this game is serious on occasion. Now it is no secret that the PC port for this game is flawed. It is incredibly broken leading to the game almost feeling handicapped. However if you can find the right mods to make this game work you have a bonafide classic that still kicks a lot of ass well over a decade later. You owe it to yourself to try it out and if you can find a copy of the first game for the Xbox 360 you should give that a try as well since that also has a lot of great ideas that were ahead of its time. This is what Saints Row is all about. I understand that a series needs to evolve in order to entertain a new demographic but you should never lose sight of what made the original games so memorable. Hopefully IdolNinja's passing won't be in vain and we do get the promised patch. Even if I must wait a little longer I will out of respect for IdolNinja. Deep Silver should also go back and play the first two to see what them good instead of chasing modern trends in order to stay relevant. To all the original fans that played the first two. We are the embodiment of the saints. We can carry on IdolNinja's legacy and hard work. We should not stand divided due to corporate greed or ignorance. We should stand in solidarity as a breed of fans that stay loyal to the classics, the works that made us appreciate open world gang bangin' and exploration. Long live the Saints and may IdolNinja fly high among the rest."
Saints Row 2,Action,"A sub-par knock off of GTA 4, except that it's more tedious, clunky and with worse shooting. Also the worst port in video game history. Worse than the original Watch Dogs. Almost unplayable without a controller because it asks you to use SHIFT AND TAB to navigate the pause menu. I keep forgetting that, and I try using WSAD or the mouse and nothing happens, you know, because most games would let me do that. The game runs okay on my machine, but the fact that it struggles to reach 60fps at times is stupid because this game is over 10 years old now. If you must play this game out of nostalgia, get a pre-owned console copy. However, nostalgia is all this game has for it. I loved this game in High School, but apart from the amount of customization available, it has little else going for it. This game is like if San Andreas forced you to do side missions to progress the storyline in an artifical way to pad out the run time of the game. Basicly, there's this mechanic called ""Respect"", and to be able to progress through the story, you must do side activies and missions to fill up the meter. This is bad news for people who like to leave side activities for when theyve completed the story. I think its kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and if you total up the game time of purely the main missions, it'll probably only be about 6 hours long. I really tried to playthrough this game again, but couldn't bring myself too. Would recommend only for people who like open world games with a character creator. And even then, only with community mods."
Saints Row 2,Action,SAINTS row 2 is not that type of game which i thought it has really boring storyline and to do mission you need to increase your respect which is one of the most boring thing in this game the developer of this game should relese it's remastered verson so that it would be more enjoyfull
Call of Cthulhu®,"Adventure, RPG","yes, but some annoying parts  when ""in the mind"" found it frustrating looking for what to do"
Call of Cthulhu®,"Adventure, RPG",Better detective stories & more faithful to Lovecraft mitology: - Dark Corners of The Earth - Prisoner of Ice - Peppa Pig: Mr Dinosaur is Lost - Elder Sign: Omens
Mushroom 11,"Action, Adventure, Indie",A very good physics puzzle-platformer that comes within a whisker of not outstaying its welcome.  For the lack of a an auto-rolling ball halfway through the last level...
One Finger Death Punch,"Action, Casual, Indie","After (I kid you not) 15 minutes with this game, I was completely hooked. For $5 (less on sale), this is a tight, focused, incredibly fun action title. Perfect for the 15 mintues between meetings/responsibilities/etc, this is one of those ""just one more round"" titles that has you constantly coming back for more. Highly recommended."
One Finger Death Punch,"Action, Casual, Indie",Very simple gameplay that is surprisingly enjoyable due to great aesthetics. This is a twitch action reaction game that requires two buttons to play.
One Finger Death Punch,"Action, Casual, Indie","played a bit of it, its pretty good"
One Finger Death Punch,"Action, Casual, Indie","Extremely funny, extremely simple yet hard AF at the same time. I'd never believe I'd spend 20+ hrs playing a stick-figure kung-fu game, moreover controlled by mere two mouse (or controller) buttons. As a matter of fact, I've killed one controller on this for sure. And I've rage-quit this more than once. Only con I can think of is the lack of cloud save support. I do have six computers capable of running this game - meaning I had to start from the very beginning six times. Maybe even more, as I surely made clean OS install on some of them for sure. Oh, and second con - the tutorial cannot be turned off. Otherwise, this is a pretty funny game I gladly return to from time to time."
Bastion,"Action, Indie, RPG","Another day, another gem from Supergiant."
Bastion,"Action, Indie, RPG",Amazing game. Amazing visuals. Amazing soundtrack. Only negative is that it is a bit too short and the story is a bit silly. Besides that it is near perfection for a quick style action hack'n'slash game.
Bastion,"Action, Indie, RPG",fantastic
Bastion,"Action, Indie, RPG","Amazing little rpg-like game, the narrator takes you over and you find yourself playing for hours."
Bastion,"Action, Indie, RPG","Finished it 3 times already, it's a great, although quite short game. Like all Supergiant games."
Mount & Blade: Warband,"Action, RPG",Good Game.
Mount & Blade: Warband,"Action, RPG","The singleplayer mode of the game was great for a while but then it just got too reperitive to carry on, like most games. Napoleonic wars is a good DLC module though and I play that a lot now, despite lacking basic voicechat functionality. Graphics look like they're from 2003 though, but this game proves that you don't need graphics for a good game."
Mount & Blade: Warband,"Action, RPG","The best ""Create your own Kingdom"" Simulator out there. Even better with mods."
Mount & Blade: Warband,"Action, RPG",W
Mount & Blade: Warband,"Action, RPG",Yes :)
Mount & Blade: Warband,"Action, RPG",sword
Mount & Blade: Warband,"Action, RPG","Poor Seige Mechanics and some annoying AI,  But it's a theme that's never really been done before, or at least in a long time. A friend once told me it's like ""Total War except you are a solider"", to a degree, I think it's pretty accurate. GENERAL BUTTPLUG MANAGED TO ESCAPE"
Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna),"Action, Adventure, Casual, Indie","I normally dont like platform games, so I bought the game to just support the creators and the culture behind it, but the cultural content is so interesting that I keep playing it just to learn more. Also the musics and graphics are really really cute."
Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna),"Action, Adventure, Casual, Indie",The name of the game is Never Alone. Then the fox died and I was alone. I feel cheated.
Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna),"Action, Adventure, Casual, Indie",It was a beautiful game and expertly animated.   The music was good.  The cultural aspects were great (the videos were really neat).  They took aspects of the culture and incorporated it into a platforming game. Learned a lot.  The bad parts were the platforming. Some areas were off the screen so I didn't know where I was supposed to go or if i could jump  or not.  The bolsa (slingshot type weapon) aim was wonky and wouldn't always go where I wanted it too.   The controls were awkward and frustrating.   I would recommend for the cultural aspects as it was a good experience but if irritating platforming annoys you than you might want to get on sale.
Tainted Grail: Conquest,"Action, Indie, RPG","Who knew summoning creatures could be this fun? The game has lots of flaws (no hotkeys to cast cards, running around the map, weird ""wyrd"" mechanics, ...) but the core mechanic of fighting with cards is very cool."
Tainted Grail: Conquest,"Action, Indie, RPG","Starts slow, but once it gets going there's a ton of fun content built on top of a solid deck builder. One warning - the controller implementation is pretty bad, be ready for some serious frustration if you're not using mouse+key. For the first couple of hours I felt frustrated and found unlocks to come trickling in too slowly, but after unlocking a handful of new cards and abilities I began unlocking more per run. Runs have been taking me about an hour each, which is a nice length imo, and you can save and exit any time (thank you!) Deckbuilding is competent but a bit hit or miss in my limited experience. There's a ton of classes to unlock, the 2 I've tried have been nicely themed even if playstyles are a bit similar (mitigating incoming damage is key because healing is limited). Base decks are pretty boring and it takes a bit to pick up enough cards/passives for things to be interesting. Story and atmosphere are fun, there's a ton of events and NPCs to encounter, I really like the concept of the world so far. There's a lot of upgrades to unlock but I've only earned enough currency for a couple. Playing via controller (XBOX) has been super frustrating. Card selection is done via thumbstick instead of dpad, and there's no dead zone so it's way too easy to accidentally move up/down when you only want to move left/right. DPAD can spend consumables even if they're not shown on screen, cancel/confirm buttons are not consistent, etc etc. I've definitely had some rage inducing moments caused purely by the controller implementation. If you like deckbuilders this is 100% worth a look, especially if you like the atmosphere. Prepare yourself for some frustrations if you use a controller. Overall I'm really enjoying this game and I'm looking forward to playing it more."
Tainted Grail: Conquest,"Action, Indie, RPG","Annoying graphics, annoying music, annoying narrator. F#ck this game."
Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments,Adventure,"Very good game indeed, love the graphics, love the gameplay and love the logic of how puzzles and mysteries work. AND it teaches you a ton of little science tricks along the way. Definitely a good game."
Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments,Adventure,"It's very good.  This game differs from other Holmes adventures in that it's a set of unrelated short stories.  The premises of the short stories are a mixed bag, but what is great about it is that they are logical and well acted.  And the best part is that after each you can choose to absolve (or partially absolve) the perpetrator of the crime, and this actually gives you quite a lot to think about.  Why does the state have to get involved in every dispute?  Sometimes the courts add more injustice to a situation.  Perhaps we should be willing to look away in certain circumstances and mind our own business.  The most interesting one for me was the last one because the game tells you how many other people decided the same way you did, and only 17% of people decided the way I did, and I honestly can't see the point of view of the majority.   I guess they thought the guy was just unpleasant?  I mean he was, but that hardly means he should go down for murder..."
Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments,Adventure,
Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments,Adventure,"Even though I do not like the TV show, I really liked this game. I am a bit distant person to a literal know it all person (Sherlock being a better doctor than Watson, etc.). And because of the over smugness of Sherlock, I definitely prefer game version of Sherlock Holmes to TV show one. Still, game characterises Watson like an imbecile and a yes-man which I don’t enjoy. Although, Watson has the most ironic line in game: “You don’t have no right to take your own life”. Stories in game are mostly satisfying, except two of the cases. Both of these cases (sauna and garden) don’t make any sense at all. Other than that, none of the cases that you solved, are based on real evidences. Most of the time, you use circumstantial evidences to arrest someone. Maybe they could have led to a real evidence. Moreover, game offers you a chance to make the wrong choice and continue from that. Plus, there are moral choices, even though they are not related to narrative and every victim is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Thanks to game mechanics you can easily choose another option in a case, change your decision or replay a chapter. Interface is not so different in that aspect; it is easy to use and detailed as it should be in a detective game. Game has the deduction mode which gives you an option to analyse a suspect. It is pretty original and with the detailed face and character modelling, offers you a fun experience. I should add that, loading screens of the game are pretty modern and interesting (at first at least). The most interesting part of the game for me was its unique design. There are lots of different scenes/places and they are not repetitive or they don’t feel like a copy-paste. The same thing applies for the mini games/puzzles. There are lots of different kind of puzzles with different mechanics. Other than these aspects of the game, cinematography of the game is great; point of views during events, quick-time events, character changes and other aspects were well-thought."
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",I can see why others would enjoy it.  But the combination of pixel art and steep learning curve just makes it inaccessible to me.

Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne,Action,somehow this game has both the best graphics and some of the best gameplay out of the entire ps2 catalogue
Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne,Action,Played it first time when I was 12 and when I saw this again on steam didn't thought twice to add it to my library. Enjoyed every bit of the the game and story. 10/10
Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne,Action,An old classic
Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne,Action,"There isn't much to say about this game, it is a TPS classic. It is a bit shorter than original game and it is not impressive as the first one but still it is a Max Payne game and it has the atmosphere which is a must at a Max Payne game, unlike Max Payne 3. The story of the game is more like a ""classical"" story. For that reason, it isn't great but it is how it supposed to be I guess. Only bad thing about it is the short gameplay time if you do not want to play again at a different difficulty. Other than that some of the level designs are from the main game, so it can felt like a bit repetitive."
Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne,Action,"way better than the first game, dialogue is on the same level while the story and character development are better. gameplay and gunplay are also better even if i miss the sillier theme of the original game some times since this one is a lot more serious"
Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne,Action,"Fantastic sequel, love this classic."

Colin McRae Rally,"Racing, Sports","Sadly, I bought this game without reading the reviews, although I'm not that prone to impulsive buying - just because the name - it didn't occur to me that same name doesn't have to mean same game (or a decent remake/sequel/prequel/quisquidqel). This is just an arcade, not a rally sim, not even close. I'd be able to get over that if there were some decent wheel support, but no, it's crappy and at best can be played with an xbox controller - but frankly, why would anyone want to play this worthless piece of poor coding on anything? Poor Mr. McRae, he's probably moving in his grave like a Wankel engine piston... Get DiRT rally instead, it looks much more promising, Interestingly enough, it's from the same dev/publisher..."

Cruelty Squad,"Action, Indie, Simulation","Disgusting, vomit inducing garbage, filthy disgrace, gorgeous meat, your sanity and health straight to the emptiness and loneliness of oblivion. I HIGHLY recommend it."

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Vegas,Action,"Game does not have online support, dont buy it for the coop."
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Vegas,Action,"You can't sprint. On the hardest difficulty, you are forced to play glaringly slow due to enemies that will lock on to you very quickly and drop you even quicker. ♥♥♥♥ spread/cover mechanics and slow ads times as well as reloading like you have arthritis combined with that lack of sprint will leave you dying over and over again while trying to play this game at a similar pace to any modern day shooter. Probably a lot better on the lower difficulty, but there is no reason I should be a highly competent fps player in 90% of multiplayer games and be getting ♥♥♥♥ on by a game for such ugly reasons. I guess it's just a sign of age though."

Wolfenstein: The Old Blood,Action,sehr gut
Wolfenstein: The Old Blood,Action,"My first review of this game was negative, it ran like ♥♥♥♥♥ on AMD gpus, but that was fixed now so I finally managed to finish the game. It was more of the same... THANK GOD IT WAS MORE OF THE SAME! If you like The New Order, this is not as good, but you surely won't be disappointed. Beats The New Colossus and Youngblood that's for sure."
Wolfenstein: The Old Blood,Action,"A nice addition, probably too expensive for what it is, but still good."
Wolfenstein: The Old Blood,Action,perfect game
Wolfenstein: The Old Blood,Action,woooooooooooooooo
Wolfenstein: The Old Blood,Action,"Good shooter, but first game was a bit better. Story isn't detailed as first one (first one wasn't detailed too). Enemies are similar. Skill tree isn't detailed as much as first one too. However, it is more like a Wolfeinstein game. There isn't much to tell actually, it is just a fun shooter."
Wolfenstein: The Old Blood,Action,"Probably my favourite Wolfenstein reboot. Perfectly reimagines both Castle Wolfenstein and Wolfenstein 3D for the modern age. Its a First Person Shooter Stealth game where you can drown nazis in the toilet and have to fight Lovecraftian horrors. Not as long as The New Order but in my opinion, alot more fun. The successor games can't touch this one."
Wolfenstein: The Old Blood,Action,Old Blood is a good companion piece to New Order. It feels more in line with Return to Castle Wolfenstein with New Orders mechanics. By no means is that a bad thing. Using old school ram-shackled guns in the 1940s is satisfying and this allows the player to spend more time in 40s which pales in comparison to short lived introduction of New Order. It's a worthwhile side story and I highly recommend it.
Dead by Daylight,Action,A piece of sh*t that I can't stop playing
Dead by Daylight,Action,Was good at first but the devs became so braindead Choose a meta and stick with it. Since when does the shape trump premonition? The game's been out for so long and the devs just waltz around making core gameplay changes which already worked the way they did. This is not the same game I bought a year ago. I also thoroughly enjoy experiencing the same bugs which have been in the game for months.
Dead by Daylight,Action,"After the learning curve, it gets pretty addicting."
Dead by Daylight,Action,spooky
Dead by Daylight,Action,"Amazing game. I jumped into this game thinking it would be boring but I was very wrong. There are 2 teams, Survivors and Killers. Killers being the best part of the game since you can play as classic horror characters, e.g. Leather Face, Scream, Freddie Kruger and Micheal Myers. (P.S. Developers please, please, please! Add Jason Vorhees). As the Killer you have to make sure to stop the Survivors, surviving! Survivors are fun too! You go around repairing 5 generators to unlock a gate to escape from the Killers. There's a really good levelling system plus ranking system. My favourite part is the perks which improve your characters. Anyways not much else to say other than really good game, pick it up, NOW!"

Warhammer: Vermintide 2,"Action, Indie, RPG","Haven't played it all that much, but they improved upon the formula quite a bit. The loot system isn't complete dogsh*t anymore for starters. And levels actually do more than just give you random sh*tty weapons too. And crafting your own items is so much better. It's still randomized when it comes to the special attributes it has though which annoys me. Oh, and for those new to this game, it's a L4D style coop survival game thingy. Cept with more swords and less guns."
Warhammer: Vermintide 2,"Action, Indie, RPG",Fatsharks games in a nutshell : 1 : Release unpolished game with minimal unlockable cosmetics/weapons 2 : Let it mellow for awhile 3 : pump out some dlc's with tedious repetitive grind with minimal cosmetics yet again 4 : Lock all future content behind dlc's such as new classes weapon skins And thats it really.

Far Cry 3,"Action, Adventure",Best Far Cry game yet Pros : - Great atmosphere; - Good story; - Great ecosystem; - Nice gunplaying and feeling; - Big and interesting openworld; - Best vehicle physics Ubisoft ever made/ Con : - Uplay.
Far Cry 3,"Action, Adventure",good game
Far Cry 3,"Action, Adventure","For crying out loud. --what is it?-- It's a first person shooter, on a island. For the third time around there is a story that is very clever and well integrated into the world exploration. There are plenty of plot-line twists and surprises. Good artwork and all around fun. The only really annoying thing was getting used to the amount of head movement while walking and running, was really off-putting, and excessive. It's not as over reaching as some other Far Cry titles, keeping things easy to get to, and to reach your story goals is well paced and keeps it interesting and fun all the way."
Far Cry 3,"Action, Adventure",Unskippable cutscenes made me sick
Far Cry 3,"Action, Adventure","it forces you to sign up in a terrible launcher, and the performance is horrible. but the game is good despite all of that."

Weirdly, Valve claims this will help against hacker and there will be no hackers at ranked for some reason. Guess what? Ranked is full of hackers and Valve is taking money for a game that was free before. For some reason, this game has one of the highest cheater ratio and developers do not care. Weirdly, you cannot gift prime status. Other than there is a gambling part which is aimed at children and used at money laundering. 10-15 years ago, Valve and their games meant something different, right now they are just greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

Buckshot Roulette,"Action, Indie, Simulation",Nirvana is a cool band
Buckshot Roulette,"Action, Indie, Simulation","Even though, it wasn’t great at release, game is enjoyable with friends at the moment. I wasn’t a fan of singleplayer (especially the achievements for singleplayer, since the luck is too important) but multiplayer is a decent choice for a couple rounds from time to time. Weirdly, there is only one song in the game and it does not bother you at all. Also, this game has an affordable price for this kind of game which is another positive thing."
Buckshot Roulette,"Action, Indie, Simulation",Good Game!
Buckshot Roulette,"Action, Indie, Simulation",awesome
Buckshot Roulette,"Action, Indie, Simulation","Outside of the questionable theme and over glorification of drugs (that also don't really match up to how they would actually affect you), the gameplay is pretty straightforward and bland. Essentially, you're playing ""Russian Roulette"" with modifiers to tweak rules. However, before you even get ""items"" that modify things you have to play a normal game... it took me like 5 tries of just guessing over and over to get past the intro to the actual gameplay simply because I got unlucky (2/3 chance to succeed but failed over and over). After that the game adds a few more elements that lets you learn information, modifies variables (damage, life, turns), steal power ups, and other ""take that"" things. Power ups are randomly distributed and the rounds change the rules ever so slightly, but it is still extremely high variance. And even with all those ""choices"" it ultimately still comes down to a very small and straightforward decision tree that isn't very meaningful or interesting. Yes, the game is pretty cheap and it isn't trying to be something that is infinitely playable, but it got boring to me before even an hour was up. Just feels like it is lacking just a bit more in terms of meaningful decisions outside of flipping a weighted coin. The setting, mood, environment, music, and so on is awesome, but sadly even all that and a great price can't save the meh gameplay. 4/10"
Buckshot Roulette,"Action, Indie, Simulation","Wonderful game ! Atmosphere is incredible ! Eager to have the multiplayer ! PS: don't miss it like me ! There is a ""double or nothing"" mode that unlock the full game purpose !"
Buckshot Roulette,"Action, Indie, Simulation","Double or nothing mode makes me severely depressed 10/10, I love gambling!"
The Turing Test,Adventure,Fun Portal-esque game where you go from room/chamber to room/chamber solving physical layout puzzles in order to get to the next room/chamber.   I like the added part of adding a robot ai.   Voice acting was top notch and professional.   Graphics were great.   No glitches.   Controls were responsive.  Would definitely recommend. well done.
The Turing Test,Adventure,"a good one, creative."
The Turing Test,Adventure,"The puzzles never get difficult.  I might have overlooked it because the game was well-made, but the plot depends upon TOM being forced to use Eva (Ava?) to solve the puzzle because a machine can't solve this sort of puzzle since doing so would require creativity.  I didn't notice that any of the puzzles required creativity, not like Talos Principle. The dialogue is well-written, but the plot is stretched far too thin.  I did quite like a bit where you got an unexpected new ability midgame.  If more stuff like that had happened, I think I would have given this a good review even with the easy puzzles, but one plot twist isn't enough for 6 hours.  Maybe get it on sale and decide for yourself though."
The Turing Test,Adventure,Awesome U should absolutely play this game Mind breaker
Mafia II: Definitive Edition,"Action, Adventure","A classic game with great story, music, atmosphere and good graphics now. Mafia II was one of my favorites, when I was a child and after playing it, it gave me the same feeling at the end. It is a great world with a beautiful story and characters."
Mafia II: Definitive Edition,"Action, Adventure",Mafia 2: Electric Boogaloo
Mafia II: Definitive Edition,"Action, Adventure",For me mafia 2 is the best game in the mafia series in every way ..one of the best game I have ever played
Mafia II: Definitive Edition,"Action, Adventure","After completing Mafia II (Classic) and then playing this I can say there's some genuine criticism to be drawn here but for all the people that are ragging on this game for honestly no other reason I feel like my recommendation is that you should just ignore them and form your own opinion. Its not a bad ""remaster"" but it does feel like a pointless one especially when the original is still available and it still works just fine. But if you're looking for enhanced ""boob"" physics and some minor visual enhancements then sure this may be for you but do be aware there are more bugs in this then the original. All in all its ok but but honestly an unnecessary re-packaging."
Mafia II: Definitive Edition,"Action, Adventure",OK
Brutal Legend,"Action, Adventure, Strategy","RTS mechanics kills it for me. Every time there is a RTS sequence, I got bore and quit the game."
Brutal Legend,"Action, Adventure, Strategy","Rob Halford is in this game, Lemmy is in this game, Ozzy is in this game, Jack Black is in this game, if that is not enough reason for you to buy it, let me just tell you: Besides all these legendary people being here and being VERY well represented, this game is also insanely good. It's a brilliant mix of Open World, Hack 'n Slash and even RTS sections, mixed with this formula we have awesome humor, incredible soundtrack and a world that literally is inspired by the greatest metal album covers. This is just genius, if you like 80/90s metal, this is mandatory."

Path of Exile,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Free To Play","Dieses Spiel macht schnell süchtig, also vorsticht ;) Habe damit vor gut 10 Stunden angefangen und denke nicht das ich so schnell wieder damit aufhöre. Warum muss ich hier glaube ich nicht erklären, denn es gibt zu genüge Reviews die das bereits sehr gut tun. Was jedoch anzumerken ist, das Spiel ist ""Free2Play"". Dieser Begriff wird in den meisten eher Misstrauen auslosen, da es in der Vergangenheit genung Spiele gab, die durch dieses Modell Items, etc. für Echtgeld verkauft haben, die z.B. das Balancing dieser Spiele immens verschlechtert haben. PoE merkt man dieses ""Free2Play""-Modell jedoch gar nicht an, und man könnte es ohne Probleme auch für einen Vollpreistitel halten. In den Meisten ""F2P""-Spielen kommt man irgendwann zu dem Punkt, an dem man, ohne Echtgeld auszugeben, einfach nicht mehr weiter kommen kann. In PoE wird das jedoch nicht so schnell, wenn nicht gar nicht passieren."

Path of Exile,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Free To Play","11/2020 update. I decided to try how the game has changed past few years. It's still great, until you reach the end game and start dying in ""one shot""-kind mentality (or generally in split second). I personally don't find the experience enjoyable and I don't think that it fits ARPGs. It makes no sense to me that you can build your character very tanky (eg. 7kish HP, maxed resists and other defensive layers (immortal call) and that the content can be very smooth and easy until something spikes and you die instantly. I've seen what the game offers now and will return next time in Path of Exile 2. Considering that it's a F2P-title, it's an absolutely fantastic experience. --- Original 2015 review: --- I've played Path of Exile around ~500 hours in closed beta and before the official release, but that isn't listed here. I've been active on the forums as well (1809 posts), so I'd say I know what I'm talking about. It's truly a rare gem amongst all the games around there. I've been actively playing since C64s, for past 8 years worked as a freelancer gaming journalist and during the 25 years of gaming, I can count the games that reach the sheer fun and quality that Path of Exile does with my fingers and toes during that time. Even with the CONS listed, the game is absolutely a no brainer - 10/10. I wrote a awkward templar guide which got over 150,000 views, and although it's not viable anymore due to changes to the passive tree as it is, it should explain why the game just rocks. There's - SO MUCH depth and options without overwhelming the player. http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/82428 PROS ------ +F2P with no pay to win! You can purchase vanity cosmetics and stash space, which is large to begin with. +Absolutely stunning amount of choices and depth how to build your character +Amount of loot +End game replayability through random generated maps (which are actually drops called maps) +Playability / gameplay +No money/gold, but still strong economy via trading various orbs, gems and items +Extremely friendly community +Polished - developing started in 2007 but the game was released in Q3 2013 - by SAME TEAM! +Diablo 2 devs in the team! CONS ------ -Old school graphics, but consider that the game has been developed for over 8 years. -First few hours are the weakest experience -> no support gems -> 'bit grindy' -Desync (was the main reason hardcore characters died back in 2013, no idea of current status) -ESC quitting for hardcore characters to avoid dying -No auction house to sell items -Hidden trade/selling recipes -Music isn't memorable, but people tend to play their own music anyways after X hours -Some SFXs could use bit more ""oompf!"" - meaning mass/power -Some hidden game mechanics (eg. certain skills cannot hit targets but once, while some can)"
Path of Exile,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Free To Play","The definite successor of Diablo 2. It has almost everything, just set items are missing."
Path of Exile,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Free To Play",Very good Diablo 2 successor... though sometimes damn unforgiving
Path of Exile,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Free To Play",Much better than Diablo 4.
Dungeon of the ENDLESS™,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy","An interesting hybrid of resource management, roguelite, and tower defense gameplay."
Dungeon of the ENDLESS™,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy","Rogue-like with turn-based resource management and exploration and RPG elements. Sounds like a weird mix, but it hits all the sweet spots. Do wish there was a bit more variety and decision making at times, but it is still a great and unique game."
Dungeon of the ENDLESS™,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy","Ultimately, this game isn't really what I want from a roguelike.  There is a lot to unlock, which is good, but the dungeon itself remains more less the same floor after floor, just increasing in difficulty.  It is pretty and well-written.  And it's nice how it connects Endless Space and Endless Legend together (both games I reviewed positively).  But I think you'll feel like you wasted your time if you played it as much as I did."
Dungeon of the ENDLESS™,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy","Played the free weekend. I found the game very repetitive, got bored within 30 minutes.   I wasn't getting that vibe where I'd be getting more and more stuff as I play like your typical roguelike game."
Dungeon of the ENDLESS™,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy","This game was a surprise, far more fun than I expected."
Dungeon of the ENDLESS™,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy","Wow! Best Early Access game I've played yet. Crazy fun mashup of tower defense and rogue-lite dungeon crawling. While I'd usually say ""keep an eye out"" for this one, it's already good enough to recommend purchasing (especially at the 25% discount currently offered)."
Tomb Raider,"Action, Adventure",titties
Tomb Raider,"Action, Adventure","Tomb Raider 시리즈는 게임 플레이, 스토리, 주인공 주인공 등 모든면에서 탁월합니다. 이번 재부팅으로 Tomb Raider가 새로운 차원에 도달했다고 느낍니다. ""gone""은 모두가 알고 사랑하는 오래된 Lara입니다. 대신 우리는 더 젊고 경험이없는 Lara Croft를 얻게됩니다. 원래 라라가 너무 얇고 체격이 바비 인형 같다고 느꼈습니다. 그래서 나는 새로운 라라를 좋아하고, 그녀는 더 평범 해 보이고, 그녀의 새로운 헤어 스타일도 좋아합니다. 이제 그만 방랑 할거야."
Tomb Raider,"Action, Adventure","Let me start by saying that I am not a fan of Tomb Raider. I played the original games years ago and found them boring. I only bought this title because I was bored, feeling nostalgic, and it was on special. I only mention this because, if anything, I had a slightly negative bias against this game; I was expecting it to suck, and boy was I wrong. Tomb Raider properly reboots the franchise. It is a larger than life adventure filled with some fun environments to explore and a lot of action packed sequences. The game was clearly built for console, and this comes across in the number of qte's that appear throughout, but if you can stomach that I can wholeheartedly recommend Tomb Raider as a very entertaining experience in the same vein as the Uncharted series. Graphics are surprisingly good, and the voice acting reasonably solid. I'd estimate the average person would get 10-15 hours of play time. 8 / 10."
Tomb Raider,"Action, Adventure",Enjoyed every bit of it
Tomb Raider,"Action, Adventure","Very predictable, a lot of bugs and really bad transitions between cutscenes but the game play is very good. I do think that this game kinda plays itself though. But if you can push through this game's  many flaws there is a lot of fun to be had. Edit: Can't finish game because of game breaking bug Edit 2: I can now complete the game by breaking the game and playing as not intended 10/10 GOTY"
Tomb Raider,"Action, Adventure",I've been so blind... so naive. For years I resented My father. Doubted him like the rest. But he is right about so much. I just wish I could tell him that now. There are so many mysteries that I once dismissed as mere stories. But the between our myths and truth is fragile and blurry. I need to find answers... I must understand. -Lara Croft <3

I like the plot better, the location is also more interesting.  Make sure you get all three acts, because it's not until the end that the developers really figure out how to do everything right, and it's fun to see their progression as you get more and more terrified.  Great plot, horrifying gameplay, nice puzzles."

"Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II - Anniversary Edition",Strategy,"Even though game cuts most of the RTS features, campaign is decent. However, there are some annoying things like unknown enemies (you can’t learn their strengths and vulnerabilities at campaign), defence missions that will overwhelm you, time consuming, meaningless and repetitive finishing animations, unbalanced difficulty, unresponsive controls and unit movement for no reason, both mechanical and visual bugs, misinformation (even when you have an item with immunity to knock back, you can be knocked back or time limited missions which don’t have the correct time limit), the worst rain animation I’ve seen, repetitive achievements (same achievements with Chaos Invasion) that you can’t 100% percent without Chaos Invasion but if you buy Chaos Invasion you will be forced to do all of these achievements in Chaos Invasion too. Other than that, Multiplayer and Last Stand options are already dead, there is no one to play. Even if you snipe each other for multiplayer, it can take forever to find game."

Just Cause™ 3,"Action, Adventure","Над серией Just Cause висит какое то странное проклятие,её игры генерируют совершенно потрясающие моменты,но совершенно никак не используют свои преимущества. Вместо того,чтобы развлекать игрока уникальными механиками,его заставляют выполнять однотипные задания из разряда убей всех. Много вопросов и к логике происходящего, Рикко получает уже третью титульную игру,но всё равно остаётся посредственным героем,да ещё и с внешностью гастарбайтера;при всём желании не хочется сопереживать повстанцам мало того, что они клинические идиоты,да ещё и по факту разрушают всю экономику и инфраструктуру острова; наёмники вообще никакой роли не играют,тупо болтают с Рико, а потом их же приходится защищать;тебе дают зачётный вингсьют, но больше половины острова засажены деревьями. Правда все эти жирные минусы перекрываются сумасшедшим драйвом. Третья часть в разы возвела культ зрелищности, конечно не каждый комп потянет эти тропические красоты, тем не менее постоянно ловишь себя на мысли как же восхитительно я разобрался с очередной базой, так как возможности для аннигиляции просто не ограничены. По факту мы имеем посредственные сюжет, героев и тирана с одной стороны, а с другой одну из самых чумовых песочниц, Just Cause 3 игра в которой нужно развлекать себя самого, лично мне, зашло - 8.0 баллов"

BloodRayne: Terminal Cut,Action,"""Wolfenstein"" + ""Max Payne"" + ""Devil May Cry"" w/ a hint of ""Blade"" and ""Underworld"". BloodRayne is a Third Person Shooter that combines elements of the Hack & Slash genre. That makes it kind of a rare combination, rarely seen besides the likes of ""Space Marine"". BloodRayne and it's sequel are like the ""Little Sister"" of Max Payne, and also are some of the few games that built upon it's format without simply copying it. This franchise was massive once in the early 2000s. Some people thought it would be the next ""Tomb Raider', but it has sadly since mostly faded into obscurity. Probably because of the Uwe Boll movies. Very unfair. You play as Rayne, a damphir (A human-vampire hybrid, like Blade) as she hunts Nazis in the 1930s trying to unleash a Lovecraftian horror upon the world. The first hour or so is a little tough to get through, but once you start fighting Nazis the game is just wall to wall fun. Cut off their limbs and see them run around screaming in agony as blood spurts from their wound until they bleed out. This game is gory and violent even by today's standards. The gore reminds me heavily of the classic stealth horror ""Manhunt"". Another forgotten classic. Some parts of it hasn't aged well, like the platform sections in the start. Also, I wish the game would give you the option to swap around what pistols you want to use, as you quite often end up using different guns in each hand. Desperately needs a proper sequel or remake, but this remaster is good on new machines, especially with texture mods."
Crying Suns,"Indie, Strategy","A decent, lightweight game."
Crying Suns,"Indie, Strategy","If you are looking for an FTL like game with this art style, I'm sure you will find this fun. So I will give it a thumb's up. For me, it fell completely flat, but I think I just don't grok this style of game. Its not you, Crying Suns, its me."
Apotheon,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG","If you love Greek/Roman mythological lore, this hits all the buttons.  LOVED IT!"
Apotheon,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG",Sparta man goes full Kratos.
Heat Signature,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Strategy","Not my cup of tea at all. +Player freedom -Feels too puzzleish - it's still a deterministic puzzle even if you have three options that are ""right on your face"". Early game the best approach is also obvious -> it's really a deterministic solution."
Heat Signature,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Strategy",I can see why other people might enjoy this game. It is just not my thing though. Not enough is going on in the different spaceship-jacking missions for me to get invested.
Waking Mars,"Action, Adventure, Indie","Easily worth 5 bucks, maybe not 10. The art design is very nice and its fully voice acted. This game is mostly exploration, no combat, and the mechanics can get a little stale. The story is meh. But overrall the exploration part of the game was very enjoyable and for an indie game it has a lot of quality put into it. There was a little bit of grinding involved which I did not like, but there is a fast travel system built in to help with that. I recommend the game if its on sale for cheap, it would be a good gift for a casual gamer."
Mech Armada,"Indie, Strategy","I was given a copy by a friend (thanks The5thViking!) and I have to say I have been really pleasantly surprised by this one. I'm not typically wild about mech games, or turn based war tactics (aside from Into the Breach, which feels more abstract). Stages are each quite short and you get to buy parts and upgrades between fights. Every larger number of fights you get some seemingly very powerful perk type things. You get to construct your mechs from 3 parts which is a fun little puzzle too. Definitely had fun with this - and it's different enough that it's not send me scurrying off to play more Into the Breach. (The magic keys are Q & E if you want to shift the camera and justify all the 3D art.)"
Jalopy,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation","От Грега Прижмачука я ожидал в первую очередь интересный опыт именно в симуляторной основе, всё таки человек участвовал в разработке F1, но на выходе у него получился симулятор ходьбы. Jalopy (Драндулет) оказался полуностальгической историей про последний крупный раздел территории Европы, когда на осколках социалистических республик появились новые страны. Наше путешествие через новые границы отдаёт грустной сентиментальной нотой, ведь даже разваливающаяся машина Лайка - дань прошлому которого вернуть невозможно. И если с концепцией всё вроде в порядке, то по остальным пунктам игра здорово провисает. На примитивную графику, по стилю напоминающую Virginia закрыть глаза получается, как бы ""уникальный"" ход. Упрощённый звук уже воспринимается тяжелее. А вот то что разработчики из Excalibur Games бросили Jalopy на середине разработки, переключившись на другую игру это уже свинство. Пусть на выходе мы имеем 4 часа скучноватого геймплея по одинаковым серым пустошам Восточной Европы, игра банально просто не доделана. За подобное, выше 5 поставить не имею права."
Jalopy,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation","Too early in development to leave a good impression. Massive framerate inconsistencies  and UI bugs Steam doesn't give the option to give a neutral reccomendation, I don't dislike the game, I'm just not comfortable in it's current state to explicitly reccomend it."
Jalopy,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation",While Minskworks continues to work on Landlord Super I wanted to give my thoughts on their first endeavor. Jalopy was a game I played while it was in early access and I can say that it has grown into a game with a basic narrative that serves only as set dressing for the basic gameplay loop. The story that follows is an automotive journey across Europe with your uncle on a mission to spread a deceased loved ones ashes. And in order to carry out this journey you outfit a jalopy with working parts and set out on long drives through the countryside picking up cargo to sell to further upgrade your car. By no means will you find yourself engaging in gun fights with local military or law enforcement just driving and it is by far the most relaxing thing to take part in. Yes it can be frustrating when you pop a tire and you don't have spare or having your engine blow up due to poor maintenance but it is all apart of the journey and almost serves as a right of passage. Jalopy is definitely worth it if you're looking for a more laid back experience.

Batman: Arkham Asylum Game of the Year Edition,"Action, Adventure","I was never a fan of DC comics or Batman and I didn't know the characters - but I saw the Batman Arkham games on sale for 5-6$ each and picked them up on a whim. Surprisingly, this was very enjoyable and had incredible combat/stealth mechanics. I didn't think this could get any better until playing the sequel Batman Arkham City, which blows this game out of the water with more of an open-world story. Highly recommend even if you don't know anything about Batman"

Conan Exiles,"Action, Adventure, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Simulation, Strategy",Couldn't recommend the vanilla game. Why would I pay a cent more for updates you developers should include in your lackluster title. Wish I could return my game since all these updates are paid. Pathetic.
Conan Exiles,"Action, Adventure, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Simulation, Strategy","This game had been fun for the most part, but these developers NEED to fix their co-op. Me and my brother played fine with very few issues during the first 4 or so days we played. Then all of a sudden, he cannot join any of my games now. Fails every single time, so we've now basically wasted our money on this game because the whole purpose of buying it was to play it co-op wit each other. F*** this game and modern gaming. Devs don't give af about co-op anymore."
Conan Exiles,"Action, Adventure, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Simulation, Strategy","No... just no. Has little to do with actual Conan, the gameplay is boring and tedious, meaningless."
Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen,"Action, Adventure, RPG","almost perfect. the map is jsut a bit too small. and some of the classes are unfit for a few situations, but i suppose thats part of the charm. overall a fantastic game and i hope capcom keeps the the same charm for sequal"
Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen,"Action, Adventure, RPG",♥♥♥♥♥♥ as my ass
Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen,"Action, Adventure, RPG",great game
Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen,"Action, Adventure, RPG","I don't think I have ever gotten more burned out on a game as quickly as I have with Dragon's Dogma; for years, I have heard it was a great game that was up my alley, and I refuse ever to believe such a claim ever again. This game's save system, lack of fast travel, and piss poor tutorials just make me feel like I have a constant headache, I thought it was just me, but reading into it, there appears to be a small subsection of people that agree. Walking from point A to B is not fun nor is good game design, for exploration it makes sense but not being able to just fast travel to towns or cities turns what was immediately arduous walking into a chore, it's made even worse when you get swarmed by enemies out of nowhere, usually resulting in immediate death sending you back to an AUTOSAVE only, making me lose 30 minutes to an HOUR'S worth of progress. This isn't a matter of ""skill issues"" it's blatantly bad design that muddles the entire experience for me at least and it's messed up since I went in feeling positive only for things to change after my first Escort quest, because the quest took me to the other side of the map and the ONLY way to fast travel is through a rare object you can acquire by paying a large sum of money for, I understand their philosophy of ""pushing"" people to explore that world, but you can already do that in PLENTY of RPG's that still have fast traveling, it just feels like artificial padding to drag out the story TOO early for its own good. I have read people's experiences and they certainly sound fun but I'd rather deal with Skyrim's jank combat than force myself to walk a dozen miles for one quest and than BACK the other way, with no real payoff other than cheap ambushes and potential reset of an HOURS progress because I got ambushed."
FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction,Racing,So... ummm... This game... I just opened it for 15 minutes so I could give the not recommended it deserved. Go get Wreckfest.

No Man's Sky,"Action, Adventure","Post NEXT. (I have no experience pre NEXT). So this is for me a game that is sometimes brilliant, sometimes tedious. The brilliance outweighs the tediousness though so this *is* a positive review. The attraction of this game for me was always the exploring a near infinite universe aspect. And I have had a great time looking at some very pretty planets, with weird flora and fauna. Exactly why I got it. The universe presented is also interesting and strange in its own way, it doesn't feel overly derivative of any other sf property. Walking and jetpacking around is fun. On the negative side are the Sentinels. These are flying robots that don't seem to serve any purpose but to be annoying. You'll be minding your own business collecting stuff and they'll show up and start shooting you. If you fight back, more come. I have no idea what purpose they serve apart from being irritating. Then you have the crafting - I know that crafting things is very popular but if I'm going to play a crafting game, let it be interesting. It just consumes time, time spent in menus. Why, if I have the ingredients I need to do something, why is it not treated as if I have that thing? I have the ingredients to make the special launch fuel, can't we just skip a load of clicking in menus and just take it as read that, I am trying to leave the planet then of course I want to instamake the fuel and get going. I got the game to be exploring, not clicking through the same menus over and over. And, as typically the reason I want to leave somewhere is because I am annoyed with the aforementioned sentinels, at this point I just prefer to play something else. And Gods forbid you actually make it into space and then have to do some space combat. Although apparently you can get ships that are better at space combat later on, the combat I'm starting with is slow, painful and again, makes me want to play something else. And then there's the inventory management aspect. Which again is next level irritating. Sure I'm a factorio player, used to carrying around acres of factory in my pocket, but the inventory restriction doesn't serve any purpose that can be described as fun or interesting, or even realistic. Even in the course of a relatively small amount of collecting resources you end up with a full inventory. These negatives aside, I've enjoyed my time with No Man's Sky so far. It's those negatives that mean it's unlikely to be a game I fully fall in love with, but it's given me some great moments so far and I'm sure it will continue to do so (in an intermittent way). Also massive kudos to Hello Games for NOT taking the money and running."
No Man's Sky,"Action, Adventure","I've had this since it was first released, and every once in a while it draws me back in; maybe it will be cool this time?  And every single time I am disappointed.  Back in 2016 it seemed like there just wasn't much to do and the worlds all were sort of samey.  The 2nd time I tried, I made it farther, but then it all seemed tedious and pointless. With the release of the most recent update and derelict ships, I thought ""Maybe now I will enjoy it!"" and started it up again, and almost immediately experienced a game-breaking camera glitch. I just have to accept its not for me, and walk away, I think. EDITED: Ok, that last bit I take back, and I revise my review to Recommended.  There are still far too many bugs in the game for something that has been ongoing for four years now, but the changes they have made have made it mostly fun to play.  I like the new quest-based systems, everything looks better, the place seems more lived in in the space stations.  Its just generally better, crossing the line into thumbs up territory."
No Man's Sky,"Action, Adventure",A come-back for the ages
No Man's Sky,"Action, Adventure","It started really really bad, it slowly turned mediocre and now it's passable, you can sink a few hours into it until it gets boring and repetative. I congratulate the devs for not abandoning it but even after all those years, they still didnt deliver what they promised in the first place. My suggestion, wait for a huge discount, then buy it. UPDATE: Oh my god they are STILL updating the game and adding more features... Its 2021, no other game had this much effort put into it, although my previous concerns are still valid even today, I can no longer downvote this game."
No Man's Sky,"Action, Adventure",its overly ambitious crap
Poppy Playtime,"Action, Adventure, Indie",game is ♥♥♥♥
Dead Rising 2: Off the Record,"Action, Adventure",Fantastic
Dead Rising 2: Off the Record,"Action, Adventure",Its only a booster shot (tm) The game
Dead Rising 2: Off the Record,"Action, Adventure","Worth playing after finishing the previous titles, it's Frank West's point of view during the events of dead rising 2. There are significant changes to the story, more weapon customization than before, map expansion, new enemies and survivors, and the added camera function like the original game which adds a new level of gameplay to DR2."
Chained Together,"Adventure, Casual, Indie, Simulation",i fell down
Chained Together,"Adventure, Casual, Indie, Simulation",Very simplistic game with what appears to be bought assets. Chaining yourself together with another mouth breather is an experience i will forever cherish. The sheer terror in your friends voice as they realize that the only thing holding them away from returning to the pits of hell.. is your self control wich is draining very rapidly as you are holding on to that single hook.

METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES,"Action, Adventure",METAL GEAR SOLID 5: GROUND IS MY FIRST METAL GEAR GAME ON PC AS I HAVE PLAYED THE OLD GAME ON MY PS3 LIKE THOSE OLD GAMES THIS GAME IS STILL A MASTERPIECE THOUGH THIS GAME IS SHORT AS THE MAIN STORYLINE OF THE GAME CONSIST OF ONLY ONE MISSION BUT YOU CAN TRY THE SIDE MISSIONS THEY ARE ALSO GOOD. THE SEQUEL TO THIS GAME IS METAL GEAR SOLID 5: PHANTOM PAIN WHICH I AM SURELY GONNA TRY THANKS TO HIDEO KOJIMA TO BRING SUCH MASTERPIECE GAMES TO US.
METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES,"Action, Adventure","it's fun, but selling a one mission from MGS V as a whole game is a scam..."
METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES,"Action, Adventure","This is hard to recommend, but if you're at all interested in the Main Game (The Phantom Pain), you probably should play this first. This is really something that should have been packaged with the main game as a prologue chapter. The games campaign is 40 minutes long without cutscenes and with the side missions it comes up to about 2 hours and 40 minutes total. But the game-play is so smooth that I just kept replaying as many times and as differently as a could and there's stuff I haven't discovered."
METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES,"Action, Adventure",Short but fun

War Thunder,"Action, Massively Multiplayer, Simulation, Free To Play","Fun for the first few hours until you realise they don't actually want anyone to reach the end of the tech trees so they made it impossible here is an example, there is 7 tiers in the tech tree across 5 branches for russia's planes, with a 7 day premium account (20 Bucks irl) and 160 hours in i am not even scratching tier 4 because i cannot make enough money to actually buy the planes. after playing 40-700 matches gathering XP to learn how to buy the plane you wont have enough and once i buy the plane i cannot equip the plane because i do not have money to train a crew to fly it and once i have done this i also need to consider buying them an expert licence for 4x the cost of training them for an extra 2 points to all stats, and then when i join a match i cannot spawn that plane because i do not have enough money to spawn it (in some modes). so i go back to lower rank stuff and grind that for a bit, then i re-equip the new planes and i find someone to kill but as i leave the spawn someones above me strafing so i try to shoot back die, get charged for repairing that plane and rearming it when i leave the match, this is your game-play loop, and it is idiotic it's easily 1000 hours to get a capable jet or other end game vehicle, and the simulator missions and historical missions all have little annoyances and costs associated to them like not being able to play a certain mission without getting a certain type of kill with a specific vehicle and a highly competetive and toxic game mode because everyone is trying to finish a match without a negative balance. Has anyone else heard of a multiplayer game that takes money away from you if you don't get enough kills?"

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,"One of the best RPG I’ve played. Writing, lore, story and mission design quality is great. Soundtrack is fantastic. Gwent is fun. Even though combat isn’t great, it is acceptable. Skill tree and equipment variety is well-made but most of the times you don’t need to change your equipment from a set piece. Graphics are still looking great and updated recently."
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,iz gud
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,RPG,"For the uninitiated, The Witcher series, based on a Polish book series of the same name, follows Geralt, a witcher, which is a mutated human specializing in monster hunting. While the first two games were about tracking down a crime indicate that stole from you, then tracking down an assassin who targeted kings, The Witcher 3 follows Geralt’s attempts to track down his sort-of adopted daughter, Ciri. Those who have not played 1 & 2 get a series of questions posed to them early on in the game that help you choose some critical choices that occurred in those games. There is also a massive character journal giving background on just about everyone written by Geralt’s friend, Dandelion. However, while the opening prologue establishes a fantastic understanding between Geralt and 2 freshly introduced character’s, Yennefer and Ciri, new players might be a bit lost when it comes to some of the prominent characters from the last two games, such as Triss, Zoltan and Dandelion. Your level of immersion in the Witcher universe is entirely up to you, but should you choose to delve deep, you won’t be disappointed. While the last two games took place in a series of medium-large environments, Witcher 3 takes the full step towards completely open world. One can’t help but think of Skyrim in this situation, and it’s very easy to see similarities. However, the game never feels like its stealing concepts. I can set my marker 300 m away and still encounter a guarded treasure, a monster with a bounty on its head, and a woman in desperate need of her lost frying pan on the way. It’s a game that rewards those that discover exploration and curiosity. Yet despite running around and doing those secondary tasks, you never quite feel like you’re just grinding, its genuinely engaging to walk into a new town and discover the people and their problems. I myself have yet to find a single ‘go to the forest and kill x amount of x’ quests. Along the way you pick up recipes for various bombs, materials, swords, armor, and mutagens that can enhance your abilities. These come together in a crafting system with a massive amount of ingredients. The problem that can occur is that few hints are given on where to find particular plants or materials. Even further unexplained is the dismantling system, where you can break down materials into smaller, different pieces. The big feature that the Witcher series got known for was its choice and consequence system, which went the extra mile to make sure that you were constantly never truly sure if you were making the right decision. To prevent you from simply reloading the game upon making a bad choice, the game is written so that often times you won’t know the consequence of your actions until you encounter them much later on. The game also features a Sherlock Holmes/Batman style ‘Witcher Sense’, which highlights special objects in the environment that you can use. Many times when you pick up a bounty against a monster, it starts at the scene where it last attacked, it’s up to you to figure out what did it, and to pick up it’s trail. Personally I found this feature to be a little bit overused, but it is still engaging nonetheless. The combat varies heavily on what difficulty you set it on. On the lowest difficulty, you may just get away with hacking and slashing, however on anything higher and you have to rely on your tools, movement, spells, timing and more. Geralt is extremely mobile and on top of parrying attacks he can also roll and quick dodge, albiet the controls for quick dodge can be a bit awkward. The brilliant thing about the monster design in this game is that no one is given visible weak points to exploit. In order for Geralt to be most effective, witchers need to prepare. There’s a bestiary that keeps track of the various weaknesses of each of the monsters. Being able to survive comes down to playing smart, and preparing beforehand. Higher level play demands patience and knowledge of your opponent. That’s not to say that the lower difficulty levels ruin the game, it’s just that they feel like two separate experiences. In previous Witcher games, there was always a game that served as a side quest. Witcher 1 & 2 featured dice poker, which didn’t have a whole lot of strategy to it but wasn’t a chore to play. Witcher 3 adds in a card game named Gwent in the mindset of Hearthstone to play, with 4 separate decks to build and use to compete against dozens of NPC’s. This is a massive step up from the previous games, and is definitely a worthwhile side quest that takes much more skill and understanding of the game to succeed in. As far as the graphics in the game go, it is absolutely stunning to look at, albeit a very difficult game to run with the settings maxed out. The Witcher 3 still manages to be a very stunning looking game. The character detail stands out the most, and the main characters in the game have a noticeably higher quality level of motion capture compared to the village NPC’s. Even small things like Geralt’s beard can astound, which grows overtime unless you have it shaven. However, the game is not without its faults, most of these are minor however, since this has been one of the better launches I’ve seen recently. Falling damage in the game is massively overpowered, taking away large chunks of Geralt’s health for dropping down 1.5 stories. Your horse can get stuck on odd parts of geometry. The swimming /diving controls can be very awkward. Sometimes during the Witcher Sense, Geralt can run, other times he can’t. There’s the aforementioned glitch in the Gwent game that I experienced, as well as the rare crash or two. The soundtrack, while amazing, can get a bit repetitious during combat. There’s a vocal track that sounded amazing in the trailers but when you hear that lady frantically singing for the 30th time on the way to the nearest town, you really wish you could tell her to just calm down. But as I mentioned, the games faults tend to be more on the minor side, and even those that are there could be patched out. So if you’re looking for an absolutely massive RPG with an engaging world and characters look no further than The Witcher 3, and while you’re at it, pick up 1 & 2, which are often on sale for $5 and under. This is CD Project RED’s magnum opus, their ultimate build up for the franchise that PC gamers have loved since 2007. You will absolutely get your moneys worth with this game, and will not be disappointment with the sheer amount of treasures to hunt, people to kill, sorceress’s to screw, and frying pans to be found. 9.3/10"

Squad,"Action, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, Strategy","In my four hours of ""playing"" this game it has all been spent troubleshooting audio issues. I have absolutely no game audio. I have tried every fix i can find. I have watched dozens of videos. Uninstalled the game 5 times. Verified the integrity of the game files several times. Changed audio devices. Restarted my pc several times. I have done it all. Still have ZERO audio. Apparently this is a very common issue and has been for some time now. It blows my mind how an issue this serious has gone unfixed. Unless you wanna risk dealing with the same infuriating problems as I have had then do NOT buy this game."

The Darkness II,Action,Emo with super powers
The Darkness II,Action,All I can say is this game is underappreciated. The first game is more or less a cult classic that may never see the light of day on PC but The Darkness 2 to me pays so much more love to the source material. From its cell shaded art style to the brutal quad-wielding gun-play I still feel like this game deserves a proper conclusion. Definitely give it a try you will not be disappointed!
Dark Messiah of Might & Magic,"Action, RPG","DMMM is a product of it's time, for sure. It has some brutal jank, poor writing and cringeworthy dialogue. But the game is pretty good, it has good physics, identity, and overall is a lot of fun. Also, ran pretty fine from the get go, thanks Source! Last. thanks to this we have Dishonored so I'll love this forever :)"
Dark Messiah of Might & Magic,"Action, RPG","This game is really good but all I have to say is that the sword play is quite methodical and clunky, basically trading hits 'till someone dies. There's also a huge issue with crashing in this game but I fixed it with putting this command ""-novid +map_background none"" into the game's launch options. Other than that this game is quite enjoyable. Also not to mention the whole atmosphere of this game is really eerie, I love it."
Dark Messiah of Might & Magic,"Action, RPG","The Best Kicking Simulator you could ever spend your money on. I think the reason reviewers ragged on this at the time, was that because of the game's pedigree, they wanted a serious RPG.  Instead you got an incredibly enjoyable action game in which you spend your time dropping goblins into traps and kicking orcs off cliffs.  The reviewers are right about the story and script being garbage, the same overly serious, overly cliche and sexist garbage that has defined Might and Magic since Ubisoft acquired it."
Dark Messiah of Might & Magic,"Action, RPG","I loved this game when I first played but now I do not know. Story isn't so good but it isn't bad if you think how old this game. There are different endings which is great. If you are a fan of Might and Magic series, I guess you will like it too, at least for the lore. Fighting mechanics are pretty progressive but at the same time, it has so many flaws like weirdly missing when you aim at someone. I played the game at hardcore difficulty and regular fighting doesn't make sense, you need to use environment heavily. Plus, most of the times enemies can one-shot you and parrying isn't normal too. I guess developers tried to do so many original things and they couldn't do any of it right. You need to crouch sometimes. I think the game is a First Person Fighting game more than a RPG. And for that aspect, game isn't bad."

My Summer Car,"Indie, Racing, Simulation","Эта игра больших возможностей, ведь здесь не только можно ездить на машине. В начале игры у вас уже есть фургон, на котором можно съездить за бензином или за недостающими деталями на вашу ""машину на лето"". Самая главная начинка в игре – это сбор автомобиля. Вам даётся голый кузов машины, и прикручивай детали как хочешь. Чтобы действительно играть в эту игру, вы должны знать хотя-бы основные узлы автомобиля, если не знаете придётся учить, хотя в интернете есть много гайдов в помощь. Но на этом веселье не заканчивается, вы должны настроить карбюратор и клапана, залить в авто все жидкости. Любой не дотянутый болт может служить причиной поломки, а их там много (болтов). Не забывайте, что вам нужно ещё поспать, поесть, помыться и т. д. (в настройках можно отключить смерть игрока). А на детали на машину и бензин придётся зарабатывать: колоть дрова, откачивать конализацию. Игра находится в разработке, так что можно ждать чего-нибудь нового от разработчиков."

Men of War: Assault Squad 2,"Action, Simulation, Strategy","As of right now, I fail to see how MOWAS2 is anything more than a full price map pack with a few updated models. I have some issues with this developer so it really doesn't surprise me,  I'll reccomend this game if/when they pull their socks up *Note, I am well aware this game is in Beta/Early Access, it still doesnt change the fact that neither the early access content or what has been advertised looks to be anything more than a few new models, some revamped maps from old games, and a few new sounds.* and for christs sake guys. Update the infantry models from 2007, and stop abusing the rating system by flagging negative reviews as abuse. DMS, you're a joke"
Men of War: Assault Squad 2,"Action, Simulation, Strategy",With the airborne DLC you can do some fun AI skirms. Also a large modding community and workshop support!

Ghostwire: Tokyo,Action,"When you think that companies cannot go any lower, Bethesda and Tango update the game and add Denuvo to the game POST LAUNCH. This should be ILLEGAL, when people purchased this there was NO MENTION of Denuvo on the page, and now people have to deal with this bloatware that makes the game stutter. Absolutely shameful Bethesda, you never learn."
Assassin’s Creed® Brotherhood,"Action, Adventure",I remember my excitement for Assassin's Creed Brotherhood very vividly since it was a direct continuation of Ezio's story which at the time was great since AC2 left off on an incredible cliffhanger at least from Ezio's perspective. When I replayed it recently i definitely enjoyed it more than I remember especially since you return to the briefly visited Rome. This time around however Ezio's status as a master assassin finally comes centerfold since as the subtitle implies you lead the brotherhood and train new assassins that will help you in reclaiming Rome. And it's genuinely a fun system especially when it comes to inducting them as a master assassin. Reclaiming Rome is also another fun thing since it feels like a heavily expanded Villa from the previous game with its own little caveats that make things interesting. This game also has a nice little jaw dropper of an ending one little warning with this game is for a game from 2011 you will have technical issues due to optimization so do be aware of that when you do jump in. But all in all I highly recommend Ezio's second chapter for anyone new to the series.
Assassin’s Creed® Brotherhood,"Action, Adventure",None of assassin's creed series can beat Ezio series ;) Even with high graphic...
Assassin’s Creed® Brotherhood,"Action, Adventure","Finished(90%+) it this 2020. Even if it was released years ago, I would still recommend this game to: Assassin's Creed fans: But start with AC:II for the full Ezio experience. Great story. Story-Driven games fans: Same as above ^. 3rd Person Action Adventure fans: Graphics are outdated but mechanics still hold up. Especially for the price(get it on sale). I would not recommend this to gamers who doesn't fit the categories above. For that I would recommend much more recent AC games. Note: Played this game solely single-player."
Assassin's Creed 2,"Action, Adventure","Very nostalgic, a challenge in which i am seeking. if you got extra cash pick her up and take her home :)"
Assassin's Creed 2,"Action, Adventure",Yessss !
Assassin's Creed 2,"Action, Adventure",Çıktığı senelerde PS3 de tam 6 defa bitirdim. Sonrasında Uplay den satın alıp 2 kere bitirdim. Ezio Collection çıktığında 3 kere bitirdim. Şimdi ise Steam den satın alıp bitiriyorum. Hadi hayırlısı.
Assassin's Creed 2,"Action, Adventure","The beginning of a Legacy Alright, lets be real here. Assassin's Creed at this point has slowly but surely devolved into Call of Duty with almost yearly sequels, prequels, spin-offs, and all sorts of tom foolery seeping from the long running franchise. However I will say that the original and the Ezio storyline are among one of my favorites in the series. Yes the other games have its moments and I will say without shame that Black Flag is still one of the best even though it fell of the beaten path of Desmond's boring midlife crisis (thankfully). But before we had Spartans and Pirates we had a Syrian and a badass Italian Assassin that is worthy of praise. Assassin's Creed 2 is (in my honest to god opinion) the Empire Strikes Back of the series. Going above and beyond to reshape the already established formula of the prior game in a big way. Gone are the days of relying on a singular set of weapons that eventually get upgraded after certain chapters you slowly build up your arsenal and become better. Another big change is the character you play as. No longer are you playing as the master Assassin Altair you now take on the role of a young firecracker named Ezio, whom due to certain circumstances takes up the classic white robes and hidden blade in a quest for revenge. And that's the beauty of this game. You spend so much time with this character seeing him slowly evolve from a spunky young man to the stuff of legends. You can feel Ezio becoming more skilled in the Assassin trade from the way you must upgrade your armor and weapons as well as train him and that's just the tip of the iceberg of great additions. You can dye your robes to break away from the traditional red and white color scheme that is so popular with the Creed, gradually upgrade your hidden blade with weapons that add more value to your already expanded line up of skills. One feature that would later be expanded on in Brotherhood and Revelations you can build up a home base that comes in the form of the Villa de Auditore and even though its nothing too staggering it gives a sense of pride to build up this dilapidated town with guilds and shops which also gives you a source of income. Also the Villa is home to one very special collectible that is worth hunting for. To me AC2 is a worthy sequel that should never be overshadowed especially since it kickstarted a lot of the already prominent features in recent titles and the sequels that followed Ezio's tale also owe it to this game. This game will always be one of the standouts of the series."
Assassin's Creed 2,"Action, Adventure","One of the best Assassin's Creed games. The beautiful cities of Florence, Venice, Roma for us to parkour in and the first game with Ezio in it!"
Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy","The combat in this game is the most god awful ♥♥♥♥ I've ever experienced. If you're not fighting a large group that hit like trucks and have tons of health you're dealing with non stop crippling status effects and stun locks. If its not that then you have a battlefield that looks like elemental diarrhea. Every combat takes me like 20-30 minutes to get through if I'm lucky, sometimes its easily 40 minutes - the animations are slow and the AI regularly breaks down and pauses for sometimes 1 minute straight. I haven't had a single combat where I felt like it wasn't painful."
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,"Action, Adventure, RPG","I typed a proper review, and then accidentally hit cancel... fug. Hell, I forgot I even own this on Steam. Havent touched AC for 10 years,  I like most things about this one, I dont like that its a typical ubisoft game that's basically the same as everything from Farcry, AssCreed, Ghost Recon and Watch dogs just in a different setting... but the RPG shift is a welcome change compared to what I left the series with story wise, while I understand there was some mysoginistic crowing about being able to play a female, IDGAF about any of that, they add both characters to the world in an interesting way,  far better than Odyssey's followup with whatever shape shifting gender bending crap that is going on with the Eivor character in Valhalla. This game's biggest problem is simply that it's too big and bloated with busywork, like 25 regions each with like 1 to 3 hours of stuff that must be completed in them,  it's incredibly repetitive. Other than that.  For a series I boycotted for almost 10 years,  it's a refreshing return. I've only put a few hours into it, but so far, I still like Odyssey more than Valhalla"
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,"Action, Adventure, RPG","Game play-wise, its pretty much Assassin's Creed.  You jump on things, climb things, murder people, etc.  Its not winning awards for new and innovative elements. But its HUGE (although vastly squashed compared to actual Greece, obviously).  And gorgeous; I often felt like just hanging out on the beach.  And the characters, especially Kassandra, are fun.  And the quests are often funny or dramatic or interesting.  And I love the mercenaries that hunt you down periodically (shades of the system in Shadows of Mordor).    A solid, fun, and enjoyable game."
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,"Action, Adventure, RPG",Assassin's Creed + RPG + Greek mythology - Assassin's Creed = Assassin's Creed Odyssey This is not an Assassin's Creed game.
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,"Action, Adventure, RPG",Way to demanding. No more then 45fps on medium settings on a Overclocked i5-7600k with a EVGA 1070 16bg RAM. And I have to have another launcher on my computer. Cannot stand ubisofts garbage launcher.
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,"Action, Adventure, RPG","Overpriced SJW revision of history, assets reused from AC Origins, storyline is meh, gameplay dynamics are not too bad though, the whole adventure and rpg aspects added to the game makes it barely playable yes, wait for a huge discount."
Assassin's Creed® Odyssey,"Action, Adventure, RPG",Honestly enjoyable even if the game design strayed far away from what assasin's creed originally stood for. Not too many game breaking glitches and the game is full of content wich is surprising considering how this is a ubisoft title.. wich also means you gotta deal with their UPLAY bs.

Fallout: New Vegas,"Action, RPG","Game was a smoking turd when it came out.  But after fixes, and mods. It became a compelling alternitave to Fallout 3. While years apart, and different developers.

However you need to play with mods or else you can't play some builds like explosion. Even with the mods, there are lots of bugs which Bethesda never cared like every single game of this developer's games. VATS system is pretty bad in this game by the way. I do not know why I gave this game a thumbs up. I guess it is because I like RPGs and first Fallout games. Anyway, buying it with bundle which includes DLCs at the sale is a pretty good idea."

AdVenture Capitalist,"Casual, Indie, Free To Play",Bitcoin in a nutshell.
AdVenture Capitalist,"Casual, Indie, Free To Play","Fun & Addictive This is a really easy and nice casual game to play for all ages, but at the same time addictive as you cant help but keep coming back to it, i guess the lure of earning billions upon billions of Pounds/Dollars is too much to stay away from, even if it is fake money lol Game runs in real time so you don't have to constantly sit at the screen watching the money build up before you can buy another upgrade/business, tune can be a little repetitive after a while but that's the only thing that i find annoying about the game. Also, for those who get truly addicted to this game (like i have) there is also an Adventure Capitalist App!! I have it on ios so i don't know if there's and android version, but again its free, tho like the pc version there is the option for micro transactions, but with a little patience you really don't NEED them to play the game as you can easily enjoy it without them :D"
AdVenture Capitalist,"Casual, Indie, Free To Play",Fun game.
AdVenture Capitalist,"Casual, Indie, Free To Play","I guess you have to have serious obsession with either very large numbers (I have to admit numerals like tresexagintillion were not part of my usual vocabulary till recently)  or with (ancient) greek numerals (vide supra...)... or  to have serious greed issues... I, for one, am combination of all those three. This game is fun."
Cyberpunk 2077,RPG,"I had a positive review of this game at the launch. I really liked Keanu & thought all the bugs n glitches could be forgiven because of the story. Fast forward 1.5 patch, I played this game again for like 10 hours, having finished the main story and side contents before I had nothing to do but to play some gigs n roam around the NC. That is when I realized how empty, unfinished, soul-less it is. I couldn't be forgiving about the bugs n glitches anymore; I mean come on it's been over a year now and this game was advertised for 7 years lmao. I never hated the walking of NPC so much in a game. Even the story which left okayish last year feels like it didn't really have an impact on the city or laws like an RPG game should have. This game is nothing but a BROKEN TRASH."
Cyberpunk 2077,RPG,"Cyberpunk wasn’t always good, but if you get it now, you’ll forget this game’s messy history and get pulled into one of the most beautiful games I’ve ever played (note: my steam playtime is not indicative of my total playtime- my first full playthrough was on PlayStation 5). It’s important to remember Cyberpunk’s launch, and it’s stupid to preorder games. That being said, this review is not of this game’s messy development or release. This is a review of the game itself. This is a great game now, despite it all."
Cyberpunk 2077,RPG,"Still has a lot to develop, wait until properly fixed. Has some 100+ hours of game play potential. Finished it, still buggy as hell, especially as the game gets closer to the ending... HOW can you miss those bugs  I will never know... And the endings can all be achieved almost at the ending making our choices almost meaningless throughout the game..."

Cyberpunk 2077,RPG,"I haven't forgiven CDPR for one of the most overhyped, false advertised, unfinished piles of garbage in AAA history.  The launch of this game, and the amount of features that it was missing, (absolutely nothing to do with bugs) was a f'ing travesty. But I've mostly forgiven them. 3 years of bugfixing, and content upgrades later, I have more positive things to say than negative. I haven't finished it's expansion yet, but its mostly given me what I wanted from it. At the end of Cyberpunk's story, with 2.0 and the one and only DLC releasing, It's just a shame so much time was spent patching holes in the boat that really never should have been there in the first place. (I've edited this at the end of 2024 with patch 2.2,  they slipped more stuff in at the very last moment and it just makes it even more sad that it took this long to get here in the first place.  At the end, playing the game start to finish is easily an 8 or 9 out of 10.  but the game is end of life now,  so much time spend fixing things that shouldn't have been rushed and lied about in the first place) CP2077 Was Rushed to market to cash in on a holiday season, and it almost completely destroyed CDPR's reputation.  After much pain and suffering, they righted most of the wrongs.  but this game will forever be a cautionary tale"
Cyberpunk 2077,RPG,"I just want a game where the devs dont make the harder difficulties just bullet sponges. Why not increase damage both ways and make combat quick and decisive, I wish i could refund this piece of ♥♥♥♥ because i cant do a stealth run with a silenced pistol when i have to put 2 mags in to the back of a normal enemies head just to kill them. Pathetic excuse for a title."
Cyberpunk 2077,RPG,"I played this game years after release to bypass all the bugs and bugs still were there. Not really big ones beside Phone bug with Ward. Game was fun. I'm not really much fan of open world as it seem to consume my time for no reason in repetitive tasks. Story was interesting but its not even near the narrative levels of Witcher. Completely different games. I don't really see reason to play it again because choices have low impact. It is more like Cyberpunk GTA and its good as that. Overall i see this game as fine, but could be better. Visuals are great. Main story is good."
Cyberpunk 2077,RPG,I like it a bit short but always room for improvement
Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry,"Action, Adventure","Played using max settings and SMAA at 4K 60 fps (AMD Ryzen 3800x, RX 6800 XT and 32 GB DDR4 RAM) using a ReShade preset. Gameplay: 8/10 - Good old Assassin's Creed 4 style combat. Story: 6.5/10 - Overall enjoyable, but nothing special. Didn't put me to sleep. Graphics: 7/10 - Looks good for 2014. Music and sound design: 6.5/10 - Soundtrack had a recognizable motif, but was not memorable. SFX decent. Replayability: 5/10 - Small map. Nothing left to do once you finish the story and grab the few collectibles. A formulaic, standalone DLC entry for AC4 Black Flag, this third-person action/adventure game follows Adewale, a freed slave that used to ride with Black Flag's protagonist Edward Kenway. Adewale's combat style is distinct from Kenway's and definitely felt good, but it's really just more of the same. The story was an enjoyable experience, especially if you really wanted to know more about him and his convictions following on his appearance in Black Flag; however, it is nothing to cry home about. There is very limited weapon customization, and no appearance customization at all for Adewale. I accidentally stumbled upon the best machete in the game just exploring on my ship following the first memory sequence. The best ranged weapon comes from 100% synch-ing the short main story, which I was able to do in 6 hours along with obtaining all chests and collectibles. Freedom Cry looks and runs great on modern hardware, but is capped at 60 fps with horrible screen tearing even with AMD Freesync Premium if the in-game Vsync is turned off, so I recommend playing with Vsync ON. Overall, if you enjoy the formulaic style of Assassin's Creed games prior to Origins, Freedom Cry is a great short adventure, and worth picking up for cheap."

You can spend hours without getting tired. Dozens of combos to memorize. Countless demons to kill. Huge respect towards Capcom for bringing this series back. I am huge(?) DMC fan as it's super enjoyable. The music the gameplay makes this game stand out. DMC is a land in Hack N slash. With every entry with a twist and different style. It's a huge change from DMC 4. Where the story stayed strong and unhold with every mission you complete. The gameplay stayed the same. Which felt great. **(Might contain some spoilers)** DMC5 has a different take on the story. The order of the games has been changed to Devil May Cry 3, followed by Devil May Cry, then Devil May Cry 2, Devil May Cry 4, and Devil May Cry 5. The summary of the story is: a new demon king has arrived, who is outstandingly powerful than the heroes. Dante got a gig to stop him. Dmc5 has 3 playable characters (4 with Vergil DLC) You play as Nero(from dmc4), Dante and V(newest entry in the series). The visuals are great. The characters are well detailed. The environment is now more destructible than ever. Pillars, builds, bookshelves are destructible and the animation is smooth. The gameplay style stayed the same from DMC4. The controls have been improved a lot. The photo mode was cherry on top of a cake. Photomode was simple and easy to use. The story was quite the interesting one. Tbh I enjoyed this one more than any DMC storyline to this date. Personally, I think this is the overall best in the series. Nero has been totally rebranded. Now he's less a simp and more a Warrior. The story intensives on dante arrival. Dante's OP. Every character has its own twist and turn. The ending hints sequel. Which would be great. Highly recommended. Probably the best DMC game for me."

""natural"" multiplayer is avaliable in specific missions, where all three characters are together, but we're on PC, so we can use mods to enable that sweet multiplayer to beat ALL THE MISSIONS with a friend."

Frostpunk,"Simulation, Strategy","Good mixture of city builder and survival game. Game mechanics are original. Discovering places and trying to survive the storm is fun but it gets boring because there isn't much to do. Even though survival difficulty and adjusting the game's rules are really hard, sandbox mode is completely meaningless, you try to survive for two storms, after that you would probably have already organised everything, so game becomes meaningless. Soundtracks are good but they are pretty limited. There are some scenarios to play for story but they are pretty limited too. Story and choices are standing points of the game. It makes you feel about some certain situations."
Frostpunk,"Simulation, Strategy","Awesome graphics combined applied to an interesting steam-punk / post-apocalyptic storyline in a city building and management survival game, I'd prefer to be as free as in Cities Skylines in terms of building, but still a good game."
Frostpunk,"Simulation, Strategy","Yup, it's good."
Frostpunk,"Simulation, Strategy","A deeply satisfying experience! This masterwork survival citybuilder with heart and soul is best enjoyed slowly, thoughtfully, even prayerfully. Its intuitive user-interface never bogs down with analytical details; its humanity always shines through. Its resource management and worker placement feels personal; each person has a name, a family. All working together and caring for eachother to survive; not for glory or greed, territory or spectacle. I love Frostpunk; it's a gem. I play it on Sunday; it's like church."

Frostpunk,"Simulation, Strategy","A great mix of strategy, story and atmosphere, 15 hours in and still haven't done anything outside the first scenario!"
Frostpunk,"Simulation, Strategy","I highly recommend this game if you fall into one of the following three categories: - you want to play a city builder (Cities Skylines, SimCity, etc) that puts more pressure on you to survive - you have always wanted to get into basebuilding games (RimWorld, Dwarf Fortress, etc) but have found them a bit overwhelming - you love basebuilding games and you're still interested in something story driven that has a more limited scope I just beat the first scenario on Normal (after one restart due to learning how building placement needs to be managed), and I can't wait to play the other scenarios - and replay the first one. The atmosphere is fantastic. I really felt like I was part of a desperate struggle to survive an ice age apocalypse. I loved the aesthetic of the town, and the feel of the world around it. This may be a drawback if you're not into post-apocalyptic or survival type scenarios, or if you don't like occasional scripted story events. The game limits how much of the world you get to interact with and streamlines your management and building options, but still gives you tons of meaningful choices to make. If you're looking for a more open-ended basebuilding game, or a game that lets you get really deep into a simulated city, you may find this game a bit shallow. But if you're not worried about those cautionary notes, I heartily recommend this game to anyone who's interested."
Dead Island: Epidemic,"Action, Free To Play, Early Access","Boring pay to win game, where you need to grind for few hours vs PvE before you can even play against players. Was too dreadful experience for me and uninstalled after 1.5 hours as the PvE is just ridiculously easy. There's minimal character progression, no drops on the levels (just some crafting components after rounds). Characters are NOT available for free to play players, you need to even buy the new characters. AVOID!"

Little Nightmares,Adventure,Very GOOD
Little Nightmares,Adventure,"nice little game with a unique atmosphere, but it's very short one so get it when it goes on sale."
Little Nightmares,Adventure,"This is the best mindblowing horror surviving puzzle game having the best graphics and really,really confusing storyline this game can easily be played in a low end pc  with medium specs and optimised graphics I really love this game in my opinion i horror gamer should buy this game"
Little Nightmares,Adventure,Amazing story and amazing gameplay but the main story is only 2 hours long. I got this game for $1 so pretty good for the price.
Little Nightmares,Adventure,Those devs gave the game for free but now they will make me buy DLC.

Little Nightmares,Adventure,"A spooky hide and seek game, a mysterious character in a beautiful creeepy place.. --What is it?-- A side scrolling adventure. You are making your way through dark corridors, and very out of place furniture boat like surroundings, trying to escape the place you find yourself in. Puzzles here and there, with you jumping on things, moving things around and avoiding things that are trying to stop you from escaping. Very stylish and atmospheric."
Entropy : Zero 2,"Action, Free To Play","I am in love with wilson, bless his digital heart. Whole playthrough feels like a standalone game more than a fan mod honestly. Very enjoyable and i highly recommend it.. and if you do try it, please bring wilson along."
Entropy : Zero 2,"Action, Free To Play","Probably the best Half Life related mod to come out in a long time. It feels so new and fun to play. Just having a kick whenever you need instead of switching weapons is a great tool in many situations and you start to appreciate kicking. The guns have nice models and great animations. The models themselves are really good. The game play is really fun and smooth. Its awesome to play the bad guy! My favorite part had to be escorting the target, something about good and bad both not wanting to cooperate with each other but having to in order to escape death was cool to me. Not to mention the Epistle 3 references. It's worth your time especially since it's free. If It gets some recognition by valve that'd be awesome as it really deserves it!"

Content Warning,"Action, Adventure, Indie","Yet again this game proves that if you want to make big in life, one of your friends gotta die."
Content Warning,"Action, Adventure, Indie","It is a pretty interesting idea and the premise is great. However, game is not really balanced and it feels a bit pointless after a while (no objective or a real target and there is danger of losing everything). Even with problems I have mentioned, the game is pretty interesting and it is fun to play with friends. I would recommend using mods to make it better. I hope developers will add more interesting features and make the game more enjoyable in the future but this game deserves a try at least, even in this state, especially with this price."

Age of Rivals,"Indie, Strategy","I bought this game at full price right after a sale ended, but I'm not even mad- it's absolutely worth the asking price! What we have here is a really well-crafted card game, with a board game feel and some wonderful design work. Each game feels quite unique due to the cards that come into play making reappearances later on- I think it is fun to imagine a story to go along with each game and strategic play, as towers crumble to angry mobs, trade routes form and gain monopoly on desired resources, and empires resort to thieving and over-taxation out of desperation. I did want to touch on something a lot of people have talked about, though. There are complaints out there that this game is ""too random"". In certain gaming circles, ""random"" is pretty much a dirty word- people want their games to be entirely deterministic, but I believe this should not always be the case. Chance is a big factor in many famous games, both videogames and otherwise, and there is nothing wrong with using randomness as an element of your game's design *if* it is balanced well. If it isn't, it's extremely frustrating and pointless, but when it is, it can be an integral and fun game mechanic *while still feeling fair*. The game does utilize some randomness, especially in the drafting mechanic, but it uses that to it's advantage. Instead of being a card game where you have to painstakingly handcraft your deck and worry about being countered by someone else's and losing before you've even started playing, in this game you are building your deck as you play- building your deck *is the game*. The interesting twist on this title from other deckbuilders is that you have to work with what the game gives you. You'll end up playing quite interesting strategies sometimes due to the cards that come into play, and you also are given a lot of chances to try and counter the opponents deck as they are building it (though they might try to do the same to you!). There's also an element of risk-management in the element of chance in some card's effects, but you are meant to either use probability to your advantage (e.g. playing only one card of a type to guarantee it receives a certain buff), or take the chance of a negative outcome as the cost of playing a certain (usually more greedy) way- there has obviously been a lot of thought into the balance of when a little randomness could both help the card's balance and add some interesting strategic plays and moments to the game. I understand that gamers see all randomness as a horrible force of evil, but it can have some very interesting design implications, and if well tested and balanced the results can be a game that's even more balanced, replayable, and fun than a game that is entirely deterministic. This all comes down to personal taste, of course, but you can't deny that the devs have cared a lot about making each card feel fair to the game, and the synergies between them are where this game really shines. The only complaint I have about this game is that each card lacks a bit of personality- this is because each card as the same type-based artwork which, while quite pretty and identifiable, doesn't help make the cards stand out from one another or feel unique. I also think it would be neat if the cards each had a little flavor text, or even a fact from history, to give them even more flair (and give you something to look at while you're opponents make their move. I have asked the devs about this, and they are on board with the idea of adding flavor text in the future, and haven't ruled at doing individual card art at a later date, so I don't think this should be a dealbreaker, especially given the continuous dedication to the game the devs have shown. In conclusion, this game is absolutely worth a buy, especially if you enjoy deckbuilding games and want to try an interesting twist, or want to try a really well designed one out for your first foray into the genre :)"
Age of Rivals,"Indie, Strategy","Age of Rivals is a strategy card game. There is no play to win, in fact once you buy the game there isn't even an option to spend money on cards. You gain additional cards simply by playing the game. I love this feature, and wish more collective card games followed this structure. So how is the gameplay? It's very easy to learn, the tutorial is very hand holdy but perfectly explains everything there is to do with the game. And I strongly advise you do the tutorial as you get enough in game gold to buy your first couple card packs. That being said, this is a game that's deep as the Grand Canyon. There are several different ways to win a game. Decks can be influenced to be culture points oriented. Culture points are the easiest way to win, as you will get more of those by volume than anything else. You can be attack oriented, this works because you get points for the 'conquer' stage where attack matters. You also have a chance to knockout all your opponents cards before they have a chance to score. There are also so many support cards that add or subtract points, attack, defense, etc. Cards that influence your gold, cards that allow you to pick other like cards. Cards that synergize with each other to make greatest gains than they would alone. The strategy is seemingly endless. This game has both normal and hard difficulties for Single Player play. The AI is smart, even on normal. There are also challanges that allow you to get rare cards. The AI in challanges are purporsely well above even the 'hard' AI and will punish every little mistake you make. There is also muliplayer. You can play against a friend, or you can play a random person online. Playing online allows you to gain bonuses to your gold if you are in a faction. There is also a monthly leaderboard that rewards gold for people that dominate it. I have 32 hours in the game as I'm writing this and I just now unlocked every card available. There is plenty of bang for the buck. This is a highly recommended game for me."
Age of Rivals,"Indie, Strategy","Simple, quick and fun. You can try it for free at Kongregate and the game is AFAIK nearly identical. It's a drafting game, games are quick and there is a nice mix of short time tactics and long term strategy. There is a good amount of skill to be had, I tried playing this when I was tired and got pwned. It's easy to get a game against a human, but the AI is strong too. There is a collection aspect to the game that I'm a little unsure of, but apparently this is much less grindy on the steam version than on the original kongregate game. This comes very highly recommended!"
Age of Rivals,"Indie, Strategy","Really liking this game! If you are a fan of deck builders, you will enjoy this. Some great combos and strategy here without being too thinky. You will need to plan your purchases and manage your income, watch the opponent and distribute damage well. Some games it will be clear who will win halfway through, yet no-one i've played with has quit yet and there have been several come from behind wins (for and gainst me!). Tutorial is clear and the AI is a good enough challenge to learn the ropes. I've had to wait no more than 20-30 seconds to get an opponent online. Lotsa fun....one more game kind of stuff!"
Age of Rivals,"Indie, Strategy","Yup, it's good"
Age of Rivals,"Indie, Strategy","Take 7 Wonders, combine all the ages into a single age, divide the cards into smaller sets for drafting, throw a lot more randomness in, and make it only 2 player. That's pretty much Age of Rivals. It lacks a lot of depth of 7 Wonders and a lot of interesting twists from other draftig / civilization-based games. Really wanted to like it, but found it very shallow with limited replayability compared to similar titles. And the biggest problem, outside of the large amount of grinding to unlock the content, is the sheer repetition of it all with huge swings due to randomness. I feel like I can make very little meaningful decisions because I don't know the distribution of the cards or what I or my opponent will get or how the card effects will happen. Like I'm just going through the motions but not really doing much and the very little control I do have ultimately is almost meaningless in the long run. If the game is on sale for like $2 consider picking it up if you're a fan of games like 7 Wonders, but ultimately it just has too many design flaws to stand apart from the crowd."
Age of Rivals,"Indie, Strategy","Easily the best computer card/board game I've played. I like it because every choice is meaningful, and battles last the right amount of time (10 minutes). Also, no two battles feel the same. For board game players, I rate 7 Wonders as one of my favorite games. Age of Rivals is reminiscent of 7 Wonders, without being derivative at all. I also like that you can try out this game for free at Kongregate.com , and can play it as long as you want. I decided to buy it, because it accelerates your deck growth by a huge percent. (500% faster than free to play, perhaps?) I wish the story mode was for more skill levels. The story fights appear to be tailored for veteran players. I stopped playing the player-vs-player portion of the game, as it only took me 3 battles until someone was spamming me with expletives. But the player-vs-computer battles provide plenty challenge and upgrade rewards to make this game purchase worth it. You can also play against friends, which is welcome. I expect to get 40 hours of enjoyment out of this game."
Age of Rivals,"Indie, Strategy",Very untertaining and deep game ! Edit: i cant stop playing it !! wow this is game is a real fusion between computer games and boardgames !! Boardgame feeling with computer hability to track game states. There is some genius in there !
Age of Rivals,"Indie, Strategy","I watched Jesse Cox play this on his Youtube channel about a year ago, and I finally got around to giving it a try. I wish I hadn't waited so long. This game is a lot of fun and easy to play. It isn't like other card collecting games where you have to spend a lot of time managing your cards and leveling them up. It's very straight forward and the cards you collect just add to your general collection - or you can put them into guaranteed draw slots. I don't usually enjoy playing against others either, and never do it in the first few days of playing - but the game play vs computer is so similar to playing vs a live person that I am not deterred at all. Try Age of Rivals! You'll like it!"
Age of Rivals,"Indie, Strategy","Every time I think I'm done with it, it drags me back in. I love it, even as a casual player. I'd pay double if the cards had individual art in the game's lovely style."
Jagged Alliance 3,"Action, Strategy",Clunky and simplified. Really bad stealth mechanics. No % chance to hit  is also a bummer since the game is not very realistic to put it lightly (shotgun range 5 meters etc.)
Jagged Alliance 3,"Action, Strategy","Spiritual successor indeed, including the ""My mercenaries can't shoot for ♥♥♥♥"" gameplay. Don't buy it, its raw garbage - JA gameplay with really bad writing/events. I can't tell you how many times I alt F4ed, the game is nothing but frustration. Its not the game mechanics either, its the retarded events - the devs are like bad fanfic writers. There are at least 3 events where you randomly get into a fight that makes no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense and its sheer stupidity. If you don't know about the fights, you lose an entire team of mercs.  That would be fine, but somehow we're at a 3rd installment and still only have 40 mercs - with half of them going MIA or refusing to hire on because of some retarded reason. Sidney: ""I have to go debate my friend about futball"" <---- Told to me 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ months ago. There is 1 event with Smiley and the Church where you are randomly surrounded, I had 1 merc (Fauda)  to go pick him up....spent 2 hours getting out of that one and thats WITH 8 vet guards. There is another at the refugee camp, where you CAN NOT LEAVE. So as soon as you start and can easily tell you're going to need back up?? You're ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I lost Flay to 20 guards because I was having him pick up gear. I don't mind an ambush...but when I can see it coming and can't leave? That is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ retarded. And now I have yet another retarded ambush to get out of.....Boss and Luigi. I tell them I'm not getting involved in their stupid spat and they ALL decide to attack my group. So now for me to continue playing the game without losing 6 mercs I'm going to have to spend hours rolling the dice. Its just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid, I don't mind losing mercs on bad plays...I can even deal with Reaper walking off to go get gynoplasty and ""cleanse himself""...Hell in JA 1 I even dealt with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ walking off with my equipment. But this forced garbage writing REPEAT ""Now you die"" ♥♥♥♥ is ridiculous. I spent 2 hours training and gearing mercs in prep to take the middle isle and finish out the game (Modded in tony's shop because bad game design) just to accidentally enter the mob boss's mansion, to get ambushed. I alt F4ed and uninstalled. On top of this nonsense: You still don't have a shop.....♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mercenary company that can't equip its mercs is nonsense and inexcusable in 2023.  This isn't a DOS game anymore. You run out of money eventually - The diamond mines magically last 2 whole ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ days. The merc pool is weak and the personalities just aren't there. You can't attack a sector with enemies with multiple squads, despite the game mechanics being there for it. Full Auto damaged was nerfed so its basically pointless, even at point blank, because the developers are retarded and need to retire. On a more positive side of things: I found and recruited Larry, I sent him to K10 alone & unarmed to die because I hate him. Mother ♥♥♥♥♥♥ walked around throat punching people to death...all the while talking about his super secret shadow, cheering at fighting zombies, and telling Ted to stfu. I went through the 7 stages of grief that battle."
King Arthur: Knight's Tale,"RPG, Strategy",This game is unexpectedly awesome. GotY candidate for me.
Pony Island,Indie,great little game
Pony Island,Indie,"I guess I feel like this game is a bit derivative of Frog Fractions, which was more surprising to me because I just clicked on it randomly on Kongregate, which I think is how you have to find something like this.  When reviewers act like they do with this game (""Just play it!  I can't tell you why!!!"")  That's as good as telling you why.  But it's not like what it is is hidden anyway, even on the store page. Surprises aside, it is mostly two games, one is an endless runner where you click the left button to jump and the right button to shoot.  The other is a game that tries to appear like a coding game, but isn't.  a cursor progresses to the bottom of the screen and you put instructions in its path to move left or right or warp.  Well, I don't really care for the endless runner game, and the other is too simple to really be a logic puzzle game, and its method to get harder is just to make you move the instructions faster.  Of more interest is exploring the devil's computer in between the levels, and I think a lot more could have been done with this.  Personally, I didn't find much of interest here.  and shouldn't there be?  Two games that I thought were more interesting that involved involved exploring a strange operating system interspersed with puzzles include Sorry, James, and Macdows 95, which I would recommend over this.  But I would be interested in this designers other games, especially Inscryption looks promising to me.  I heartily enjoyed the demo."
Dwarf Fortress,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",I LOVE THIS GAME

Galactic Civilizations III,Strategy,"Graphics are dated and crude AI is beyond stupid, almost always aggressive and the only diplomacy it knows is asking for unreasonable stuff from you. The ship design screen is a hell to deal with The tech tree is cluttered and not user friendly Events are mostly irrelevant and illogical. What a waste of money and time this game was for me I cant even begin to explain, I miss the old GALCIV days."
Galactic Civilizations III,Strategy,"Become the leader of the space UN, Build starbases in the middle of someone's territory like a d-bag, pummel lesser races into oblivion and then demand half their fleet as a condition of their surrender, then bomb their homeworld with the ships they just gave you. and then bankroll an invasion of your next neighbor by caputruring and selling furry ball pets to the galaxy 10/10 Okay, Im taking the piss, it's not a perfect game, but I bought it back in alpha and thought it was ♥♥♥♥.  tried it again about a year later and I got addicted to it,  what a difference some proper dev time can make. Oh, and I dont know if its because I had a large map going or not,  but the game is a complete resource hog. I saw it taking up to 9GB of memory at one point. that's the most I've ever seen in a game ever"
Desktop Dungeons,"Adventure, Casual, Indie, RPG, Strategy","Minesweeper-ish combined with a dungeon crawl. Tons of fun and really strategic. There's a small amount of a luck, but overall the game is very deterministic. Really challenging and yet interesting as well."
Total War: ATTILA,Strategy,I've really nothing to say. It's a full priced expansion with very few new features. And I don't consider it memorable at all.
DESOLATE,"Action, Adventure, RPG","It's not a bad game at all, graphics are nice, story has some potential, the island is actually interesting, but I cannot recommend a game with such a shallow FP combat. At first I though it was going to be more like an exploration game with some combat elements, but the combat is there like, all the time. Since combat is so frequent, the combat needed to be better, it just needed more, more moves, more impact, more responses, idk, some wounds, some cuts, some impact, something that does not feel I am punching a weightless ragdoll like 95% of survival games."
DESOLATE,"Action, Adventure, RPG","This game feels like a generic horror survival asset flip. (Played at 1440p, high settings using an AMD RX 6800 XT, Ryzen 3800X and 32 GB RAM) Gameplay: 5/10 - Finicky hit-boxes and unresponsive melee combat make the game feel very sluggish. Story: 6/10 - Interesting concept but slow progression constantly hindered by lackluster gameplay. Graphics: 6.5/10 - Visually, it looks good. Artistically, it's uninspired. Music and sound design: 5/10 - Generic horror sounds, mediocre voice over work. Replayability: 3/10 - Dying is not punishing, but rather annoying. I received Desolate as part of June 2021's Humble Choice. Granted, this game is $6 at the time I am reviewing it, I would still not recommend it at that price. This game feels like an early access asset flip using UE4. Multiplayer is functional, but does not incorporate any of the multiplayer elements in the story, as all ""cutscenes"" and voice overs come from your character's mouth, even if one of the other players in the lobby triggers it. The game feels unpolished given the wildly unresponsive ""melee"" combat, guns feel useless, and the inventory menu leaves much to be desired. I had multiple occurrences in which my left and right mouse clicks just stopped working for melee combat, and I tried to use the ""unstuck"" button to respawn my character nearby to see if it would fix it. Nope! It teleported me BACK to the starting area nearly 2000 meters away from my friends. To top it all off, my melee inputs still didn't work! I had to restart my game and join back in order for it to work again, and still make the journey back to my friends starting from the spawn building, as leaving and rejoining the lobby does not save your character's last position, only their inventory. This happened to me FOUR times in <2 hours of play time. I stopped playing after reaching the first colonized settlement on the island, which is really where the lackluster VO stood out the most. Many of the characters seem like they should be Russian due to their name or way they talk, but they are voiced by seemingly amateur Americans reading off of a script. Even with the game's ""mysteries and unsolved questions,"" the slow pace and clunky mechanics did not encourage me at all to want to seek answers, rather, just work from objective-to-objective to fix workbenches and follow the main story. The world does not feel alive at all due to the static patrol routes and spawn points of enemies, and lack of interaction between me, the player, and environment. Jump scare points are also baked in, so you will be bound to encounter the same human enemies, creatures, and scares multiple times in a single session if you die and have to return to your last location, or re-enter buildings for loot. Dying, at least in the beginning part of the game, respawns you in the starting ""room"" in which you walk towards an elevator to ascend to the surface. You have 10 minutes to retrieve your dropped loot, else it disappears. I've heard from my friends that the more you die, the more the room deteriorates, but I personally did not see it happen, maybe because I had to constantly restart my game due to other issues. Having to walk everywhere combined with my grievances with the spawn system discussed above is frankly just annoying and not enjoyable at all. Overall, I would not recommend this game for someone itching for horror survival. There are many better options out there."
Mainframe Defenders,"Indie, RPG, Strategy","Great turn based jewel, which does NOT play like a puzzle. + Roguelike/-lite -vibe due to plethora of gear/loot/maps/<things that could happen> + Fantastic customization option for the players without player being able to pursue any ""best path""; instead you react to what pieces of loot would work best for you / the resource (matter) rewards + Squad of 4 ""mechs"" chosen out of much more + Lots of loot / mech unlocks + So light you can eg. play Gloomhaven on second display while playing this + Perfect for parents due to the turn based nature and quick turns"
Pikuniku,"Action, Adventure, Casual, Indie","Pikuniku is a short, but pretty good and charming game."
Brigador: Up-Armored Edition,"Action, Indie","This game is fantastic. Great music, love the graphics, tons of content and the gameplay is fun."
Brigador: Up-Armored Edition,"Action, Indie","Fantastic game. Art, writing, atmosphere, combat, vehicle design, quantity of content, music, all top notch. Controls were a bit tricky, basically twinstick tank controls (I played with WASD + mouse) if that makes sense, but I'm bad at this type of game so maybe they're not *that* tricky. Restart on death can be mildly annoying in longer levels, but that made victory feel more rewarding imo. I beat all the campaign missions, and I'll probably play some freelancer ones in the near future."
Brigador: Up-Armored Edition,"Action, Indie",+Aesthetics +Plays well -Too simple & repetitive
Brigador: Up-Armored Edition,"Action, Indie","Five hours in, and I love this damn game, no matter how much I suck at it."
Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy,"Action, Adventure","It sure is pretty, even fantastic looking.  The art direction is top notch. And the writing, especially the dialogue, is good. Which you will be forced to enjoy through very long cut-scenes, scenes of walking around doing virtually nothing, scenes of conversations with only illusory player input, etc., because the actual game part of the computer game is tedious and super-linear, so thin as to be nearly invisible. I sat there after 10 hours of play looking at it in my library and realized I couldn't be bothered to play the tedious game in order to see what happens next.  I wish they had made exactly this into a Disney+ animated series. Like everything nearly exactly as it is, but don't bother with the illusion of playing a game."
Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy,"Action, Adventure",great game
Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy,"Action, Adventure","Ooooh well! Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy! Coming from Marvel, which I consider one of the most sterile entertainment companies in the current world, Guardians of the Galaxy. Never been a fan of it, never heard of it before the movies, never watched the movies, but an action game with good recommendations made by the awesome Eidos Montréal studio? Sure! Why not? It was so much more… Damn, what an experience! Guardians of the Galaxy is phenomenal! Basically, all regarding gameplay, story, dialogue, soundtrack, graphics, and scenario are top-notch, real AAA. I legit burst out laughing several times and even had watery eyes on some emotional scenes. After the Avengers: The Game kerfuffle, I really wanted to stay the ♥♥♥♥ away from the Marvel + Eidos combo, but they succeeded in basically all regards here. This is a jewel, a gem, it has no GaaS elements, no DLC, no Microtransactions, it's a 20+ hour HONEST game, all killer, no filler. Gameplay is phenomenal, you control the Star-Lord at all times, but the other Guardians skills are at your disposal at almost all times, so you can basically use all skills at once, and hell yeah! Chaos and Fireworks!!! And those characters? Amazing! Love my bro Drax The Destroyer! My only critique would be the performance, some slowdowns, some framedrops, some bugs that forced me to restart checkpoints, and getting stuck on geometry, but for a 20+ hour game, having to reset twice considering the checkpoint system is pretty good? It's fine! In the end, I love it! It probably didn't get the love it deserves, so if you're on the fence? Go for it. You will AT LEAST appreciate it, I guarantee. It's pretty Metal. Guess I'll go watch the movies now huh? Get some more Drax vs Gamora dialogues, why not!"
Darksiders Warmastered Edition,"Action, Adventure, RPG","One of the greatest third person hack and slashes. The game has decent lore but story is a bit limited, reading the comics helps a bit. Graphics were great at it's time. However, it is still decent. Mounted controls are just horrible for this game if you are using a console. At one level, I was aiming for the killing achievement and i was able to get only 100 kills after ten tries and countless deaths while doing just one run. After that, I changed to keyboard and mouse, and I got 150 kills at first try. So you can understand the difference from that example. Lastly, there are no dlcs but play time is not short for this game."
Darksiders Warmastered Edition,"Action, Adventure, RPG",สนุกมากๆ แต่ชอบภาค 2 มากกว่า
Darksiders Warmastered Edition,"Action, Adventure, RPG","Excellent, albeit on the easy-side, 3rd-person hack-and-slash game. Easy Recommendation This game's strong point is its gameplay: responsive controls, badass animation, decent puzzles, and varied mechanics. Complementing this is its exploration, nice rewards, and just the sweet spot in terms of quantity (looking at you AC games); backtracking never felt tedious. Lastly is its graphics; its stylized design still holds up today. The story is decent but doesn't hold a candle compared to its gameplay. It is your typical gods vs. gods worlds in apocalypse type of story; nothing remarkable. As for its characters, let's say the marketing for Mark Hamil's The Watcher doesn't bring the comedic relief it set out to be. The protagonist, War, is an unstoppable force with minimal character arc; he was weak at the start, and he became strong due to his big boy talent of killing all the things. Other characters are just there to either make sense of the story or provide a structure/barrier. The only standout in the character department is Vulgrim and Ulthane, not because they offered meaningful story pieces, but provided the much-needed character this game lacks. The only issue I will gripe about is its save states and checkpoints. You will find yourself saying WTF when the game loads you from a checkpoint or savefiles. There were times when I continued from a previous day's play session wherein the game didn't save some of my progress like chests picked-up, and location I quit from (and yes, I made sure I went to Vulgrim and serpent hole'd to another location to get the autosave icon). Another is when I die from an encounter; the game will then respawn me in a state different from when I entered the stage; IE from full health, the game will respawn me with only 3 bars of health and the enemies at full health. Darksiders Wrath of War is a game that is carried by its gameplay and mechanics. War may be responsive and satisfying to play and control, but the lack of character development makes this game not as great as it should be, along with its cast of characters. Nevertheless, this is a great game that I recommend to gamers who want to have a grand old time being one of the four horsemen and beheading fools that come in your way—being an unstoppable force while looking at beautiful sceneries."

The Deadly Tower of Monsters,"Action, Adventure, Indie","When you buy an Ace Team game, you never really know what you are getting into, but it is always worth it!"
The Deadly Tower of Monsters,"Action, Adventure, Indie","Charming art and atmosphere, but a very frustrating amount of backtracking. The game frequently throws obstacles in front of you without letting you know that you will unlock something later that will let you get by. And then when you do unlock the ability later, you have to wander around trying to remember where the blocked off area was. Plus it's not always clear what item will solve what block. Also to accomplish some things you have to be a different character, but swapping characters is only available at a certain building that isn't readily available - meaning you have to teleport around to waypoints until you find one that's near the swap building, and then make your way all the way back to where you were. Overall I found the game too frustrating to enjoy."
Ion Fury,"Action, Indie",I'm not a sucker for nostalgia but this one is a legit game in it's own right. Level design is top notch and gameplay flow is great.
Ion Fury,"Action, Indie",Simply yes.
Ion Fury,"Action, Indie","I really like this game, and honestly it's one of the most fun fps games I've played in a while. BUT, I have 2 big complaints with this game which are that the levels are pretty bland for the most part and it makes the game feel very repetitive after a while. I also don't really like the enemies and you fight the same 3 or 4 enemies throughout most of the game.  I'm currently almost finished with the game, but because of these complaints, I am finding it difficult to motivate myself to finish off the last 2 or so hours that remain of it. Don't get me wrong, it's a great shooter, but because of these two negatives, you just feel worn out by the 7th hour. 6/10"

VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation","I barely started this game and I already f*ckin love everything about it. A couple things of note are the music and the characters. The music is like an *rgasm in audio format. It fits the cyberpunk theme of the game so well I think. And the characters? They feel like actual f*cking people. Not characters in a videogame. There's only like 1-2 other games I've ever played that weren't visual novels like that. One of em's Torment 1 and the other is Rance 7. And that main character is oh so sexy despite not intentionally being designed to be that way. Now that's good character design if you ask me. Blatant sex appeal gets pretty f*cking tiresome after a while and something more subtle like this is very refreshing. Now I get why it's rated ""overwhelmingly positive"" on steams. Also this is how you do good female characters. None of that Alyx Vance sh*t. I really don't get why little miss super generic hollywood action heroine is so popular. ""Visuals inspired by old Japanese adventure games for the PC-98, with a modern touch for an otherworldly experience."" I grew up playing pc-98 vn's so that definitely pushes a button with me."
A Way Out,"Action, Adventure, Indie","Having played both ""It Takes Two"" and ""Split Fiction"" before trying out ""A Way Out"" it gives some interesting perspective on the game. You can definitely tell it is rougher around the edges than the future titles, but that also gives it a lot of charm. There are some intense sequences and it feels a lot more grounded and the consequences real. Some parts are much weaker than others and some of the combat sequences are pretty meh. Plus, the ""dialogue at the same time"" with one being super muted felt like an odd decision. However, all that being said, the more realistic and relationship building between the characters was much more impactful. Having more free form interactions and actual meaningful decisions that changed how you approach things was appreciated instead of the more ""on rails"" gameplay of the others. The highs were very high and the build up to the ending was very satisfying. Overall, it was weaker in terms of gameplay and overall design than the other titles, but the story and characters had a lot more depth and feelings, so to me it balanced out to be similar to ""Split Fiction"" overall. 7.25/10"
A Way Out,"Action, Adventure, Indie",really really good game honestly a must play for anybody who likes a good story. really interesting gameplay too
A Way Out,"Action, Adventure, Indie","This game is one of the best co-op games I have ever played. Gameplay is really original and not repetitive at all. Every chapter offers something different than others and there are a lot of mini games you can enjoy. Other than that, graphics look pretty good and writing is decent. Plus, playing this game with a friend is a joy. So, I definitely recommend this game."

The Room Two,"Adventure, Indie","The story could be a bit more interesting, but what the game does well, it does very well.  It's very fun to explore the puzzle boxes of the various rooms looking to unlock their secrets.  I wish a few of them were better lit, but they are all gorgeous and tough enough."
The Room Two,"Adventure, Indie","Puzzles area bit meh, but down voting mostly because the controls are frustratingly awful. I shouldn't have to be zoomed all the way in to something to be able to interact with it."
Assassin's Creed® Unity,"Action, Adventure","I usually don't make reviews unless I have either played a considerable amount of the game or have finished it but in the case of Assassin's Creed Unity I need to write this review early and sadly its gonna be negative which honestly I don't want to do because there's definitely a lot of great ideas flowing through this game but they can't save what feels like a slow burn that never ignites the same joy previous entries brought. To give a little bit of an explanation for this series, ever since Assassin's Creed 2 the series has seen a yearly release schedule and at the time of its release, Unity was the 7th commercially released entry in the series which is awfully fitting since it made its debut on the 7th generation consoles but at this point, the series began to feel a little long in the hidden blade if you catch my drift. This game was ambitious. And this ambition is what kinda led to its downfall in a way. I don't think it's as bad as people make it out to be but it's certainly not great. However even with its ambition it really feels like an amalgam of previous ideas that have been updated for the then news consoles/audience. I love the idea of separate pieces of armor affecting your stats lending a light RPG feel to the game, I love the visuals even if by 2021 they are painfully dated to an extent. What I don't like is how they really tried to step out of the safety netting that previous installments had set. The parkour is by far the weakest and most cumbersome I've had to deal with. Gone is the seamless simplicity of the ""Revolution"" titles but this weird ""state-of-the-art"" bull crap that complicates movement for me at least. I will play this game to completion but for what its worth this game just feels bland and life-less. Where you should have reinvented the wheel you did and where you shouldn't have you did but you failed. I feel like the Ubisoft Hubris was broken after this game and hopefully when I get to Origins I can share higher praise. But unlike its name there was no ""Unity"" only division among the fans and developer."

Just Cause 2,"Action, Adventure","Blow sh-t up.. Just cause you feel like it.. Ok just keep scrolling those reviews, this is not my proudest one so far."
Just Cause 2,"Action, Adventure",A classic that is still fun and looks great all these years later. 8.5/10
Just Cause 2,"Action, Adventure",Just because
Just Cause 2,"Action, Adventure","Just cause it's aging really well. Just cause it still looking great & plays good. Just cause there's so much action, and so many things to do. Just cause it's running really smooth in 4k on my modest PC."
Just Cause 2,"Action, Adventure","Never got the appeal of this game. Just another poor man's GTA knock off, like Saint's Row. Except that you're a spy, not a criminal. The map is huge sure, but its empty with little to do except blow things up. It doesn't feel real or filled with character like say GTA IV or Red Dead Redemption I. Weak characters and story. Junky, awkward shooting. Really bad driving. I mean, really bad. Sleeping Dogs has worse driving, but thats about it. Apparently people really like grappling hooks and parasailing, because thats all this game has got going for it. It gets old quickly, espically today. The game sure hasn't aged well. I played more of this game back on 360. I didnt like it then, and I don't like it now. It runs well, if memory serves. Much better than some other open world games of it's era. Nothing special, unless you really have a thing for open world games. Also, the plot is basicly CIA propaganda with little nuance, commentary or satire. It doesn't take its self too seriously, but the plot never stops to acknowledge that destablizaing countries because you don't agree with their politics is always a bad idea. Because thats the plot of this game. You literally have to destablize a country. This was a series that shouldn't have ever progressed passed the PS2."
Just Cause 2,"Action, Adventure",Has some bugs and sometimes it can give you a cancer. But game is still fun. Wait for sale and then buy it
Just Cause 2,"Action, Adventure","I bought this game with some leftover money, and was very weary of if it would be fun or not.

Hyper Light Drifter,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG",Hyper Light Drifter is basically a perfect game. Even it's football is better than FIFA :D
The Witness,"Adventure, Indie","Wonderfully delightful.  Far and away the best game I've played since Talos Principle.  The game is beautiful with a multitude of surprising environments that interact wih the puzzles in interesting ways.  There's a lot to think about in the audio and video clips while you're walking around.  And I'm starting to try and piece together what happened on the island and what I'm a witness to.  I wish I could stay up all night and finish it but I have work in the morning. Edit:  So, finished the game, I was wrong.  There was no story to piece together and people who complain about the ending have a point.  It really is the worst ending I've ever seen in a game. it's worse, I think, than it just abruptly saying ""The End.""  But it was still a great set of puzzle and nice to look at."
The Witness,"Adventure, Indie","I love puzzle games. But The Witness is just frustrating. It is so very abstract and open ended that it just has you wandering from place to place without much meaning. Once you start to understand the ""logic"" in the puzzles it starts to click... but you spend so much time just wandering around that the puzzle part (which is also extremely repetitive) just becomes so minor. Wanted to like it but really couldn't. Highly recommend The Talos Principle over this."
The Witness,"Adventure, Indie",i ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hate this game and everything it stands for
The Witness,"Adventure, Indie","To describe it in one word, The Witness is smart.  It has an intellect of its own and has so many nuanced, brilliant pieces that I was continually in awe."
The Callisto Protocol™,"Action, Adventure",This happened to my buddy Eric.
The Callisto Protocol™,"Action, Adventure","The Callisto Protocol is again one of those special cases where I wish Steam had an in between instead of strictly Yes or No because there's a lot I do enjoy about this game but a lot that made me dislike it near the end which is quite a shame especially since members from the original Dead Space team worked on this. But I will commend them on a few things before I really go for the jugular. The team at Striking Distance knows how to build an intriguing game world that for some may truly feel desolate but for me not entirely claustrophobic like Dead Spaces planet cracker, but Callisto's Black Iron Prison feels like it would be at home in the 2000 AD universe with Judge Dredd patrolling the cell blocks, ready to crack an inmates skull with a baton, hell I would go as far to say that the weapons you use in this game could be used by a Judge from *that* universe and the team that worked on developing those weapons deserve a round of applauds. But now my jugular tearing critique. This game may have *some* callbacks to Dead Space with its minimal hood and heavy use of dismemberment but Jesus Christ this game is nothing more but an overly cinematic ""horror"" game that barely thrills or scares, not to mention that at launch the damn performance was far scarier than the overall experience that was presented. When I say this game is overly cinematic I mean it because I'm not sure if the dev team was trying to win any awards in regard to animations but it certainly feels like it because every little action you perform accompanied by almost over-exaggerated follow through animation. Healing gets a prolonged animation that does you NO favors in combat, granted it can mitigated by stomping on corpses for potential healing kits that work instantly but still your character goes through this whole song and dance routine of kneeling, inserting, then injecting themselves with a syringe. It is so unnecessarily long that it is about 7-8 seconds long. Weapon switching isn't some instant affair either. Because all of the weapons work off of a universal frame system you are treated to a prolonged animation of your character switching out the receiver for a new weapon, it's reminded me a lot of Homefront: The Revolution but even those animations weren't super long even though here it's not as long as healing. And Jesus the amount of times you need to crawl through a small space in this game damn near kills me even though it is infrequent but none the less you're subjected to a long ass animation of your character crawling or squeezing through a tight gap, it got to a point where it just felt like artificial length to make the game feel longer. Combat also suffers from this weird fixation on cinematic animations. This game has a big focus on melee combat, so much so that dodging perfectly leads to a brief slow down so you can ogle at your ability to strafe left or right oh so perfectly and THEN you can clobber the plug ugly punk that stands between you and your precious animations. But all jokes aside combat just boils down to beating monsters with a stun baton that I dubbed the silly stick while dodging left, right, or holding back to block which I NEVER used but hey if you're good at laying down combos you can stun an enemy for an opportune moment to shoot them. I would mention the GRP which is just the kinesis from Dead Space but I rarely used it unless I wanted to get a crate or score a quick kill. But even with all this laid out combat is painfully basic. I would go into another tangent about the ludicrous animations mainly with getting weapon upgrades but I feel like you get the point, this game uses a lot of animations that just bring gameplay to a stand still sometimes and it could be argued that it's suppose to raise tension or make things feel more dynamic than they should but it just feels infuriating. I don't feel scared or anxious, I'm just annoyed and the ending to this game adds more fuel to the fire because despite enjoying some sections of this game I don't feel the need to play it again because for some weird reason this game did NOT launch with a new game+ mode, and I am aware that it will be added later but just the absence of this kills any type of longevity early on for this game and the ending just feels like sequel/DLC bait. I won't lie I bought the season pass even though it's a practice I find quite abhorrent (hypocritical I know) but with that in mind I swear to god if the true ending is sold as DLC I will rain fire and brimstone because although that practice has been done before and almost anyone can agree that it's a stupid tactic that really should NOT be done especially with a game with so much great production value. Overall I think The Callisto Protocol is a pretty looking game that has a solid art direction but it's almost completely diminished by a pretty lack luster story and design choices that are laughable."
The Callisto Protocol™,"Action, Adventure",dark space 1.5
The Callisto Protocol™,"Action, Adventure","Feels clunky and not very fun. The opening sequence is alright, and the graphics are quite good. The story is meh. It's definitely not as good a game as Deadspace was. The enemies are kinda predictable: if you walk near a vent or crack in the wall, after a while you just know something is going to pop out. The combat is boring as hell and very poorly implemented. Fighting multiple enemies is a mess, switching weapon a pain in the arse, and the dodge mechanic doesn't feel like it works right. Weapons aren't that fun to use. Most of the game involves throwing enemies with the GRP glove or bashing them with a stick. There is a crazy ramp up in difficulty during and after the platform sequence (you'll know it when you reach it), and some really poor choices in auto save points, causing you to have to re-purchase the same upgrades and sell the same loots dozens of times in some cases just to die in a fight and have to do it again. Death scenes and other animations are a bit too long and can get annoying real quick. Manual saves don't work as you'd expect them to, but rather just serve as alternative checkpoint saves, so serve almost no purpose (I didn't load a manual save other than the test how it works). It's mostly so you can create your own ""chapters"" to replay later if you want, but the game actually has very little replayability since there's no real variation in anything. You'll be stuck seeing the same cut-scenes, using the same weapons, and using the same fighting strategies. All-in-all a disappointing game, given the beautiful graphics and environments the artists created. You can see a lot of love, blood, sweat, and tears went into the game, and it's a real shame it just didn't come together into something really amazing. I'd still give it a 6 / 10. But there are definitely more engaging games to play."
The Callisto Protocol™,"Action, Adventure","Totally a fun game that can coexist with Dead Space IMO, with it's strongest point being the combat because chaining some pew pew while beating the crap out of those Biophages is amazing."
The Callisto Protocol™,"Action, Adventure",Good game 11/10
Kerbal Space Program,"Indie, Simulation",Probably one of the most unique and enlightening games ever made.  You'll find yourself following in the path of early space exploration - even the explosions.  The achievement of actually getting to the moon (and beyond!) is indescribable.
Tales from the Borderlands,Adventure,scooter should not die.
Tales from the Borderlands,Adventure,"Wonderful, one of the best Telltale games.  I haven't played a lot of Borderlands, just a bit of Borderlands 2, and it's okay, but not really my sort of game, but the world sure works in this more story driven setting.  It's one of only a few comedy games where the humor consistently lands.  And i liked the plot twists.  I didn't figure out who the Stranger was but it made sense. The only thing I suppose I didn't care for was that the game gave you the idea that you could side with Jack, but didn't really follow through.  I don't care too much for false choices.  Also I wish there had been a few puzzles along the way.  Sometimes the game opens up and lets you control a character.  But it's only to push the analog stick forward.  In those situations it would have been nice for a few puzzles to show up.  Sometimes adventure games make the mistake of feeling like they always need puzzles, and that's why they end up with stupid things like the inflatable duck puzzle in The Longest Journey or the cat-moustache puzzle in Gabriel Knight 3.  But maybe I'd like one that just had the few good ones that made sense, and otherwise focused on strongly delivering the story.   Maybe some day that happy medium will come to be.  It's not here yet. But 4 stars out of 4 for a great ride."
Tales from the Borderlands,Adventure,"Normally, I despise Borderlands games, because of its “story”, annoying and cringing writing or dialogues and repetitive gameplay. However, this game has great writing, character development and soundtrack, while having a well-matched world with tiny references to the other games of Borderlands. Even though there are some illusions of choices, like all Telltale games, some of the choices impact the story. Also, I would recommend buying this from the sales, since it has great discount rate."
Control Ultimate Edition,"Action, Adventure",no
Control Ultimate Edition,"Action, Adventure","throughout heaven and earth, i am alone the director"
Control Ultimate Edition,"Action, Adventure",Control is a beautiful mind bender that reminds me of something written by Christopher Nolan. There's never a dull moment thanks to the bountiful array of mind powers at your disposal. Also your service weapon is the swiss army knife of video game weapons. From being a service pistol to a handheld shotgun the service weapon is on par with Mega Mans arm cannon. Also the game was developed by the same talented minds behind Alan Wake so I highly recommend it.
Control Ultimate Edition,"Action, Adventure","should have been first person, to much shooting and corridors. all games should have first person. this is an important message to all. first person. game was cool and all. SCP games are very interesting usually"
Control Ultimate Edition,"Action, Adventure","Honestly, I am giving this game a thumbs up, just because of the art direction. Some scenes were terrific (the maze one especially), art style and atmosphere were perfect. As you can see, graphics were also good. However, there are a lot of things that I did not like. First of all, the story, it wasn’t great, it did not answer any of the questions and there were overwhelming about of collectibles which did not add much to the story. The characters weren’t really that strong, also, only Ahti was an interesting character. Still, the story isn’t that bad; if you like the SCP stories, it could be interesting for you but these kinds of stories give me a sour taste for the most part. The real problem was the gameplay. It was a bit unbalanced, you can only select two weapons at the same time, most of the weapon upgrades are useless and there are a lot that you can find, enemy variety wasn’t great, soul system and constant respawns were annoying while repeatable quests were unnecessary, at the end I had a lot of souls which I cannot even use, there were no chance for me to buy the materials (mold ones were near impossible, after the related quest). By the way, I am the director, why do I need to find a keycard to access some areas? Just get the highest one from an employee. Foundations DLC was pretty much same with the main game. It adds a couple hours of playtime, a new area, it felt like a teaser for second game. It was a huge negative for me to not being able to use the new skills at other places, ally rangers’ AI and Jesse not even commenting about her fight with Former before. Other than that, new weapon upgrades were worse than the original ones and enemies felt like bullet sponges. The second expansion is similar to the first one for its features, except there is a boss which is a bit annoying at the end. Of course, except three certain upgrades, weapon upgrades are much worse and enemies have much more health. At least it adds one new enemy type and a new weapon mode."
Control Ultimate Edition,"Action, Adventure","Blandest brain damaged main character tries to untangle spooky ""complex"" quantum omega spooky containment bureau while obnoxiously trying to be relatable with her own inner monologue. I finished the game and during this whole time i was surprised that the main character could resist eating all the pencils in the office. Story sucked and made absolutely no sense and its all blamed on the games ""deep lore"" as a crutch."
Control Ultimate Edition,"Action, Adventure","Interesting, although rather difficult for me. But great thing is, you can adjust the difficulty in-game by ""cheats"" in menu."
Control Ultimate Edition,"Action, Adventure",TAKE CONTROL
Control Ultimate Edition,"Action, Adventure","The voice of Max Payne alone is worth it :D now i think about it, how about a remake of max payne 1&2 in this engine?"
Control Ultimate Edition,"Action, Adventure","Daaamn, It's a jewell! Control is hypnotic, plays like a dream, runs like a dream, story is just awesome, it has depth, intriguing and is incredibly fun. It is very easy to recommend it, the story can be a little confusing but once you understand at least something, it get the gears rolling. The characters are very likeable and Courtney Hope's dub is amazing. It is a very intimidating game too, lots of info, reading and worldbuilding, just, give it time and you will start to love the story sooner rather than later. Control is also one of the most advanced games in the industry, amazing visual, destruction is in the pantheon of the absolute best, gunplay is excelent, ray tracing is super well executed and optimized. Also, incredibly, it has all the DNA for a compelling Metroidvania! Took 28 hours for me to finish the base game and both DLCs, which is a good time, considering the game never got tiresome and always introduced something fresh. Sountrack, as expected by Remedy, is amazing on every level, also, that sweet end credits song, hmmm hmmm! I though I hit play on my Spotify by accident, great choice! Since the DLCs does not have any Steam page, I will leave their reviews below: AWE: Is fine, nothing major but not bad either. Feels like a filler. A little more spooky than the base game, but very mild. Spoiler: Always good to see my man Alan Wake. Too bad AWR and AW2 is stuck in that hellhole called Epic ♥♥♥♥♥ Store. The Foundation: This was great DLC. This feels like a proper endgame, story is expanded greatly and it is great to see the Bureau after the events of the main game. Lovely DLC, easy to recommend too. Overall, just go for it!"

However, story isn’t any good either, pretty generic and boring for the most part, even for a shooter. Plus, some annoying bugs still exist."
Battlefield: Bad Company™ 2,Action,"Sweetwater, when is Bad Company 3 coming out?"
Battlefield: Bad Company™ 2,Action,my old school is here
Battlefield: Bad Company™ 2,Action,"It was awesome back in the day, aged like milk."
Battlefield: Bad Company™ 2,Action,"This is what BF should've built upon. Wide areas, 100% (or close to that) destructible scenarios, really good weapons and vehicles, not, whatever the hell they did with the franchise. The campaign story of the game is your generic and unilateral Murica gud Russie bad, but the characters are actually reasonable, stereotyped, but sometimes the story is just, self-aware? Idk... There's a lot to enjoy here. BFBC2 is BF at it's prime, it will be hard to top this."
DOOM,Action,"One of my favorites in the series and I know this is probably an unpopular opinion, but I personally enjoyed this one much more than Doom Eternal. I definitely preferred the slower pace and lack of platforming in this one. 9/10"

Quake Champions,"Action, Free To Play","man..this brings back memories.. that, in itself, is worth a thumbs up :)"
Quake Champions,"Action, Free To Play","I want to make this very clear. I did not grow up playing Quake or its multiplayer however I know the legacy surrounding the many iterations from the original to Quake 3. Also I am terrible at Quake multiplayer so there's that. I remember the massive gate keeping that veteran players had towards new comers with this installment saying things like ""you wouldn't understand it"" or ""it wasn't made for you"" however over the past couple of years the quality of this game never impressed me. This is a Quake multiplayer game that was released during the hero-shooter craze thanks to games like Overwatch and Paladins and it shows. Yes, play as familiar characters from the series but they all have their own patented ""ultimate"" abilities that were made popular by Overwatch but even then they don't feel that significant. They just feel like a requirement they added at that time to drum up interest for casual players that liked Overwatch. Also for a series that focuses on break neck speed and skill this game feels painfully slow in comparison to the original Quake multiplayer (I have not played Live or 3). Honestly I don't know what it is. The game just feels dull and boring. Visually it looks appealing but no amount of eye candy or fan service (Classic weapon skins and characters) can liven up what honestly feels like walking in knee deep mud. You want a game that pays homage to Quakes story and multiplayer? Play Dusk."

Sniper Elite 4,"Action, Adventure","Red Fox calling Mother Hen. Red Fox calling Mother Hen. Receiving you, Red Fox. Rebellion just made the best sniping game ever made, your mission is to post a positive review on the game's Steam page. Out. No, but seriously, I don't take this lightly. I just adore Sniping games and there have been some good games, and a LOT of garbage in this genre over the years, but none of them was so well designed as this one. For me, they nailed basically everything. The maps are amazing, crafted perfectly for sniper gameplay, the ballistics are the best on the franchise, the xray cam just received incredible upgrades and the shots are spectacular, all bundled in with cheesy story/dialogue, great sound design and incredible graphics. Italy's is just beautiful here. Sniper Elite 4 takes my favorite sniping game crown from SGW: C2. The only criticism I can offer is that there is no visible damage after the shots, you see brutally beautiful shots in slow motion but no entry or exit hole at all. That's something that was precariously present in previous SE games but completely gone here. Ah yes, they fixed Hitler's testicle in this one. HEHEHEHEHE GOOD JOB!"

Once Human,"Action, Adventure, RPG, Simulation, Strategy, Free To Play","Even though this game is visually beautiful while having an interesting premise, season reset feature destroys the game. I do not know why they added this thing in the game but seasons last for a couple weeks only; then the game resets the server and you have to start over. It keeps the progress for quests and some of the items with blueprints but sadly it is still annoying, especially for the people like me who play with friends for a couple hours weekly. Who would have thought that people have a life."
Heroes & Generals,"Action, Free To Play, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, Strategy",The game is dead. 3 players.
Heroes & Generals,"Action, Free To Play, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, Strategy",Game had a humble beginning when it was in alpha and the devs were committed. Downhill ever since. Servers are dead ever since they buffed tanks. Reto will never learn lol
Heroes & Generals,"Action, Free To Play, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, Strategy","Would be a great game if there wasn't such a god awful grind.  The ambient lighting is terrible, but the rest of the graphics are reasonable. It's not so much the expensive weapons and xp grind, the maintenance is ridiculous.  The game can be very fun when you actually get things to use, but 3-4 matches in and some of your equipment is half dead...and very expensive to repair, so expensive that it will keep you in this perpetual loop if you want to actually use the things you saved up for. Example: You just start with a rifle (You have to repair this and any attachments for it as well, including ammo), no melee weapon, no grenades, nada. You grind out some matches, dying a lot in the process, to get XP for ribbons. Those ribbons give you access to gear....gear you have to purchase. Once purchased, the gear will degrade heavily if its not basic stuff. After 5-6 matches, grenades cost me ~50% of the price (7200ish) to repair.  you only get 2 to 6k per match, even with excellent scoreboard rankings It literally feels like hazing, you will get killed left and right, and go up against superior equipment...especially if you are palying US. Germans and Russians ALWAYS have tons of grenades, scopes, sniper rifles, OP tanks, etc. Still a lot of hackers as well. Tons of people using Radar. Some of the battles are so depressingly one sided (Terrible match making system) that I've spent at least 4 hours sitting at a base and just shooting a wall to level up the gun or just driving in circles. Top all of that off with idiotic bullet tracers coming at you from competely different directions than the guy shooting and I've got about a month left before I drop this altogether. I'm honestly tired of getting killed in 1 torso shot from 1000 feet away."

The Council,"Adventure, RPG","There are some cool things in this game like art style & graphics and rpg elements, but: - annoying main character - cringy ""where is mu mum"" plot - obscure exposition where after 45 minutes of gameplay you don't know who you are, where you are and why should you care - unskippable dialogues makes it a no-go for me. I only played it for 45 minutes so maybe this game becomes very good after some time invested, this very well may be, but I just don't feel like finding out."
HITMAN™ 2,Action,"this felt like an EA sports annual update.  Same game as last time, a few minor visual and control improvements,  a few new levels.  and the gall to make people pay to have the old levels in the upgraded version.  It's been a while, but that DLC If I recall correctley wasn't cheap either. Also, Screw Epic Games.  I wont buy from your series again"
HITMAN™ 2,Action,u take cover with space what the ♥♥♥♥
HITMAN™ 2,Action,"I love the dedication of the open-world environment the devs brings, they always do their research and its always such an immersive experience. I laughed so hard when I saw Indians bobbling heads in the Mumbai mission and the poop that comes out of the drains. I love the voice acting of the main characters and Lucas Grey is such an interesting figure. I also want him to have his own missions hehe. Hitman 2, visually appears more glitchier than previous Hitman games when in comes to in-game objects, so far the only con I can see. I own mostly Hitman franchises cause I enjoy it so much."
HITMAN™ 2,Action,Not a stealth gamer but i really enjoy playing it.
HITMAN™ 2,Action,"a lot of fun, devs added a lot of content. not very story based i feel like but its fun"
HITMAN™ 2,Action,The best the Hitman franchise has ever been.
HITMAN™ 2,Action,"Cant even start a single mission anymore because it crashes the moment it starts loading. I keep checking the game integrity and everytimes files are found to be missing and restored. However the game still keeps crashing (Tried on DX11 , DX12 as some fixes suggested but no results) Verified all my drivers and contacted support, got told they stopped making updates for the games and all they could do was to apologize for the ""inconvenience"" Great game when it actually can be played though."

Cities: Skylines,"Simulation, Strategy","What an awesome game! For ANYONE who loves city builders, this is the one to get! It has had some criticism for lack of disasters and ""challenges"" and yes, once you get your finances sorted and flowing, money tends not to be an issue. BUt, like any sandbox game, you make issues out of what you want. For many, it is traffic and public transport. Fact is, the game looks great. You will admire your city for ages. The DLCs add a lot and there looks like more to come. I'd highly recommend some traffic control mods to assist you in your traffic problems though. Easy to learn, a pleasure to play. It's a game that will have you think, but won't have you stressed when errors are made. Challenging without huritng. SImply the best city builder I've ever played and will continue to put hours into it in the future!"

Cities: Skylines,"Simulation, Strategy",Highly addicting game also doing this review just for the badge thx
Cities: Skylines,"Simulation, Strategy","Compared to Simcity 2013 and the blubbering failure that is the Cities XL series, Skylines is probably the most well rounded of the bunch. Simplistic design and a wide open mod community. The mods are a blessing and a curse however, the game by itself is very barebones and almost requires some custom assets to spice up the town a bit.  And there's no quality control with mods nor is there a very easy way to manage them, you'll often find yourself subscribing to dozens if not hundreds of mods and custom assets only to find that some of them corrupt or otherwise impair yourr experience. So Skylines is really only for the enthusiasts who are willing to take the time to fine tune all of that stuff. Aside from the annoyance of the custom assets and workshop items, one thing I must point out is the audio of this game, it's boring, and it's annoying as all hell. It's terrible.  Seagulls, Annoying emergency sirens, and a bunch of bleeping and blooping.   Repetitive music, I hate the audio design of this game."

PWND,"Action, Casual, Free To Play, Indie",TIME TO PWN! PWND is awesome plain and simple. It's a game that pokes fun at an old gaming insult and turns it into the focus of the entire game. Gameplay is hectic and fast and will truly get you pumped up to PWN some players. However I do worry about this game since it's a little under the radar at the moment and it really does deserve some love for it wacky and over-the-top fun. Spread the word around about this game and get the love the it deserves because believe me I don't want another Smash+Grab scenario.

KARDS - The WW2 Card Game,"Casual, Indie, Strategy, Free To Play","Upon release, it was easy to build up a card collection and play competitively without spending money or an ungodly amount of time. This is no longer true, and the game can now best be described as hostile towards casual play. When KARDS came out, it was a game about deploying and moving your units to attack your opponents base. Yes, there were a few gotchas, but in general the gameplay was straightforward. Now, without an encyclopedic knowledge of the cards, you're simply not getting anywhere. UPDATE: Yes, the devs have come out with a new progression system. There do not seem to be any rewards in the new system. For comparison, in the previous system earning the field marshal rank in each nation would net you eight packs and an elite card. This exacerbates the basic gameplay issue, and moves KARDS far closer to a pay-to-win model. UPDATE 2: I've played again as mobile version is out. Balance seems to be more stable, but not what it used to be, your deck will need to have a strong construction to even begin to play. Playerbase has mostly not recovered, and support for the application is weak; I accidentally registered my account to an e-mail that I don't even know, and have had absolutely no action days after filing a support ticket."
KARDS - The WW2 Card Game,"Casual, Indie, Strategy, Free To Play","Edit: The game is available on mobile, so you probably should play it there instead. I have clocked maybe 300-400 hours total, but felt like I've seen the game and moved on. I suggest checking Cards & Castles 2 which reminds me of Duelyst. Having played pretty much every DCG out there, I didn't initially like Kards - in 2019 or so. Now in 2022, Kards has matured to a fantastic DCG. About my time - I've been playing it on Epic. There's full crossplay. Can't wait for the mobile version for ease of access. I've bought the 4,75€ ""welcome package"" and that has been enough to speed up the initial card collecting. You definitely don't need even that, but I wanted to support a proper developer that has managed to craft something fantastic. Neat art, neat SFXs and GFXs. The game has much less RNG feeling than eg. MTG (lands) or Hearthstone and feels like heavily skill involved. Still after 100h+ of playtime, I still notice myself making actual gameplay mistakes even though I've reached the highest possible rank in the ranked ladder (rank 1). I do not particularly enjoy rank 1 games, it just feels too RNG who draws and what, but DRAFT (think HS Arena) shines."
KARDS - The WW2 Card Game,"Casual, Indie, Strategy, Free To Play",I enjoy this game very much. And the upcoming changes on Dec. 10 are much needed for balancing. I like how the developers are supporting the game and continue to put out content. Finding a match is pretty fast which means that the player population is healthy. I hope people continue to support this game. It's fun!

SIGN ME UP! Hades is a game that I enjoyed quite a lot, mostly because of its unique story setting, recently finished the main story, yet there's a lot left to explore, the lore is immense. The gameplay is, to simply put, chefs kiss. It is just perfect, there's literally nothing that you can ask for the game to have, it has everything that makes a game great. The gameplay is so good! Though it is an endless roguelike game, it doesn't feel like it as every time you start a run you encounter a new line, a new insight into the characters. You have multiple weapons to choose from, each having a different playstyle, different stats, and whatnot, this makes the game so much fun, though it has half a dozen weapons my favorite one was the TWIN FIST. That weapon is too good and it just fits my taste. The characters are great, to unlock further stories with your characters you have to interact with them multiple times that alone will take you over 100 hours of gameplay, which I haven't done YET. I took my sweet time with this game, went on break, and was unable to play it due to a broken PC, but ultimately managed to finish it, it is addictive at times. I plan on reaching the true ending with each character, that would take a lot of time but it is worth it tbh. My favorite characters would be Meg, Nyx, and Cerberus. The voice acting was so good, each character has almost endless lines, and the voice of Meg was literally peak. The visuals were beautiful, and each section of the map was. My favorite was Elysium, it was marvelous. The one I hated the most was Asphodel, seriously that place sucks, the boss fight was good but man I hate Asphodel. In terms of the boss fights, I liked Hades and the Furies the most, the boss fight against Hades has two stages and it feels good. Theseus and Asterius were the toughest one in my opinion, I died there more than I died in the hands of Hades or in the pits of Asphodel. TBh all the boss fights were fun, more or less. The mini-bosses were annoying though. That being said, the Furies were the most fun, beating them was fun, and that first boss hits differently."
Hades,"Action, Indie, RPG","Another amazing game from an amazing company. Love the gameplay, art and narrative."
Hades,"Action, Indie, RPG","Before I start, I don’t like the rogue-lite genre, I just bought this game because of its developers; maybe that caused having mixed feelings about this game. Even though, I loved the art style, it feels like a bit PG (Tartarus-Hell). Other than that, they are a bit shiny for a game like this: If I get some boons from Zeus and Dionysus to make a combo, I can’t see my enemies’ movements to dodge them. That wasn’t a huge problem though. Let’s continue with the most important aspect of rogue-lite: Gameplay. A rogue-lite game must be challenging and not-repetitive while it makes you a better (both as a player and character progression). However, Hades doesn’t give the feeling of either of those. Enemy and area variety isn’t great, boons you get don’t have many aspects to follow while duo boons and legendary boons are limited (you reach them mostly at the end of the run). There are some different weapons and their different aspects but again they are not so different from each other. For example, best way to fight with melee weapons is spam locking the enemy. Unlockable skills are too passive most of the time (stat increases, more health, more resurrection, more boon rerolls or more dashes). Because of these passive progression skills, you don’t feel stronger or the satisfaction of progression; it just feels like a grind. In addition to that, rewards like darkness, gems, ambrosia are quite low, while requirements of rewards are so high. Maybe, it is just because I don’t enjoy rogue-lites, I don’t know. One of the most important things in a game is story/writing for me and when I looked back the other games of Supergiant, this game doesn’t feel that strong. First of all, story comes from a modern rewrite of Greek mythology. There are lots of references but they are not so deep, mostly mentions (Zeus being a serial rapist, Hades’ story, etc.). When I look at the story and the usage of the atmosphere, they felt disconnected. Most of the dialogues are random and there are lots of different dialogues. So, when you trigger a condition, like two character talking to each other, a lot of time can pass until you can talk one of the characters about the conversation. For instance, when I completed the Poseidon’s quest, I was able to talk to him about it 15 runs later. Other than that, there is the story progression aspect which is a hard thing at a rogue-lite. Even though, Hades provides the motive in a logical way and integrate it in genre’s features. It feels slow and grindy. When you combine it with the low amount of rewards, game feels like a chore. Also, credit and epilogue scenes were a bit anticlimactic. As a positive note, game offers you a god-mode (again a bit grindy god-mode) option to see the story (the slow progression and countless runs requirement persists of course). Lastly, music and sound design. Although, sound design and voice-acting are pretty great, music isn’t there. Most of the songs are ambiance/combat music and they have some style. Unfortunately, these songs aren’t remarkable. Other songs are good but not as Transistor or Bastion OST. You can see Darren Korb’s super high voice range or hear Ashley Barrett’s lovely voice but they don’t feel like a soundtrack, they feel like independent songs. As mentioned before, integration is a huge problem in this game. And one of the greatest features of the Supergiant’ games was harmony between music and atmosphere or story. In conclusion, I have a lot of problem with Hades. Probably some of them because of the high expectations I have, some of them because of the genre. Still, I do think this game isn’t a bad game, especially with its low price, sales policy and not being a broken game (I still haven’t seen a bug at a Supergiant game). Sadly, Hades was a mediocre experience for me."
Hades,"Action, Indie, RPG","When it comes to rogue likes there's very few that hold my attention due to them becoming slightly repetitive over continuous play. Hades however takes that fear and throws it into the river styx simply because it feels so much more that your average rogue like. It feels organic and as one critic said feels less ""gamey"" all because it acknowledges your progress and failures going as far as having characters comment on your runs and how you died you FEEL like you're growing in power all because you have a motivating story and a logical reason for why things get randomized. I also wanted to comment on Jen Zee's brilliant interpretation of all of the Greek gods since they are astounding and such a marvel to interact with and the actors behind these characters really brought them to life which again adds to the organic feel. They're not just a bunch of selfish gods that follow the same time of personality they are all varied and likable and if it was possible I would love a game that just follows the Olympic Gods just on the principle of how enjoyable they are. Overall if you're on the fence about buying Hades just do it, you will not regret and that's a guarantee."
Hades,"Action, Indie, RPG",i love you dusa
Hades,"Action, Indie, RPG",Very good.
Hades,"Action, Indie, RPG",Now this is what a story driven roguelike should be crafted.
Hades,"Action, Indie, RPG","I don't normally buy and play Early Access games, but made an exception with this one, based on positive reviews and praise it received - and I certainly don't regret it. Most of all, I totally love the aesthetics of the game. And it's still fun after some 30 hours in, so I believe with more content added, this will be a game to return to often."
Hades,"Action, Indie, RPG",I don't usually like roguelike games but this is the most fun I had in a while. the gameplay is fantastic and the characters/gods are so unique and entertaining. + it will make you dash irl
Halo Infinite,"Action, Free To Play",Sheldon Cooper would have approved this. XP system is broken tho
Halo Infinite,"Action, Free To Play","Game-play is great but poorly optimized for PC version. Game seems to run better on console unless your playing on an Xbox One then your fps will be super sluggish at a capped 30 fps. Progression is improving but still greatly slow. Ultimately, players should be rewarded on performance and match completion but this still hasn't been added. SBMM is in social game modes including big team battle which is a terrible choice for players like me who already have a high k/d ratio. Every game equals a sweat fest unless the host has a significantly lower k/d ratio than me. Why would you add SBMM in social game playlists when you already have arena and ranked game playlists?!? Also, if you have already played many bot games like majority of people already have in order to grind the battle pass XP and you've been destroying the bots every single game, that will raise your k/d ratio incredibly high. Then once you go to play socials, you'll be playing against the best players in the world since you'll always be matched with similar skill players. Weapons urgently needs balancing fixes, pistol and battle rifle seems like the only viable weapons to kill people. why spend so much emphasis on adding brand new weapons to halo when majority are heavily lacking behind everything else. Same goes for certain vehicles like the wasp, bullets in the wasp do practically nothing majority of the time. At the time of writing this review, i'd give the game a solid 4/10. They did alot right with gameplay mechanics and abilities but overall, the game is a major downgrade in comparison to older halo games or how halo mcc handles its XP progression and matchmaking selection."
Halo Infinite,"Action, Free To Play","Worst Halo to date, dying franchise, Halo 3 still the best Halo game to date."
Halo Infinite,"Action, Free To Play",You blow things up and things blow you up too if you are too close.
Halo Infinite,"Action, Free To Play",Disappointing and forgotten
Halo Infinite,"Action, Free To Play","Halo multiplayer experience with better graphics and that's it, the matchmaking is horrible, constant crashes and FPS drops, cant see your friends unless you restart the game etc, moreover weapons are worthless, cant level up without actually paying money and leveling up gives you nothing but meaningless cosmetic stuff, especially driving mechanics ARE HORRIBLE, people say all that stuff about BF2042 then come praise this mess... Update: The multiplayer has become dominated by cheaters. The single player campaign starts good but gets repetative and boring, the story leads nowhere, they are over-extending the Halo storyline. In short both story and multiplayer fails at every turn. Dont buy."
Halo Infinite,"Action, Free To Play",the functional scoreboard shows how truly next gen it is
Halo Infinite,"Action, Free To Play","Game play wise it feels like a smooth and modernized Halo multiplayer experience. However, though the game play is fun, the maps are kinda bland and don't really feel like anything new. The biggest negative for me though was that twice in one day my game randomly froze during a match. I played it a few days later after uninstalling it and I didn't run into the issue. Hopefully it stays this way. What's unbelievable to me though, is how these AAA companies keep churning out more and more sequels. I loved Halo growing up, but I think it's been time for a while to move on to a fresh new series."
Halo Infinite,"Action, Free To Play","Performance is fine, ppl need to learn how to configure games. Audio is straight out of a trash can that's been sitting there for months, meaning no footsteps until anyone is within 5m of you, and directional shots and whatever don't exist. Grenade spam needs to chill the F. down. 1 per person is more than enough for each life. And why is getting shot descoping still a thing in 2021? The only decent fps in the past 5 years has been MW2019,(no not WaRzOnE) and even that could have been improved if they would focus on it."

Warframe,"Action, RPG, Free To Play","Warframe is very playable (actual shooting 'feel'), twitch PvE-shooter, which even sounds good. BUT... there's a big BUT. Pretty much all the information imaginable is HIDDEN from the player. That's just terrible game design, considering the game is built around crafting new Warframes and weapons aka reward mechanics. Every single player will encounter following issues, which aren't explained anywhere in the game. Sure, you can check some of these from Wiki, but even then you need to know what to search. Eg. I was confused about Fusion Cores - so I searched that from the Wiki. Too bad there was no information which was relevant nor even link to FUSION, which was completetly other title - and had the exp tables I was looking for. -Affinity orbs appear every few second. What's that? Exp? Exp for warframe? Selected weapon? Everything? -Modification & Fusion cores. There's separate rank AND max rank (which isn't said anywhere) vs Exp vs Exp requirements for leveling up - major f*ckup here. -You can get components, eg. ""Reaper Handle"" - which you cannot find any information in the game. You'll just have to accept the fact that it's a ""prime component"", without having any idea what's a prime. Or what do you do with one. -Damage types aren't explained anywhere I'm probably going to check the game out again every now 3-6 months just to see if they've managed to add the relevant information which would make the actual playing FUN."

Warframe,"Action, RPG, Free To Play","Dynasty warriors meets Korean MMO grind. In 5 hours I never felt a variation in gameplay. There's tons of ways to upgrade and change your loadout, but combat was excruciatingly boring. The ""plot"" was inscrutable, the various forms of currency/collectibles so numerous as to feel meaningless, and the game does a terrible job of telling you where to go next or how to complete prereqs to unlock content. Who knows how many dozens of hours it takes to get to something interesting, I've got better ways to spend my time than this insane time sink."

Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales,"Action, Adventure",black spiderman
Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales,"Action, Adventure","Positives: -Game play: Zipping through the city is fun and smooth with equally smooth and enjoyable combat. The stealth was also pretty well done. - Performance and graphics: Personally I experienced no crashes except for one random crash towards the end of my experience with the game and only some small map bugs. Such as some of the activities' info on the map wouldn't pop up at times or the letters would be jumbled together. The load times in this game are some the fastest I've ever encountered in gaming. Lastly, the game runs and looks fantastic. My PC is decent, nothing crazy, so I had to run it on low to mid settings. But even on these settings, the game looked great and the frame rate was always really smooth and stayed above 60 fps. Negatives: - Price: $50 for what is essentially a dlc with a story that you can complete in about 6 hours is ridiculous imo. If you do all the side quests and a bunch of the side activities you can get more time out of it, but at most I would pay $25 for this. By the time I had reached 94% completion I was pretty burned out and done with this game. - Story: Story wise, it was just ok, I wasn't really impressed. And there was a woke vibe running through the game, which though not too in your face was definitely present and annoying if you pay attention. -Enemies: Some of the characters and the main antagonists were where this game really fell apart and ruined a big part of the experience for me. A large chunk of the enemies were actually decent imo and I thought the intro with Rhino was actually pretty cool, but ""The Underground"" faction of enemies and their leader sucked and they are supposed to be the main antagonists of the game. I really didn't enjoy playing a large part of the game fighting really lame looking neon purple Gen Z cyberpunk kids. None of them, except for the heavy shield enemies, look remotely intimidating, but instead look like a bunch of angry college kids in futuristic neon purple outfits. And as for their leader the Tinkerer, I hated this character just as much, since she was just as lame as the rest of her crew. - Characters: Most were decent and some I actually liked, such as Miles' uncle. But when it came to your best friend Ganke and the main character himself, Miles Morales, I could not stand them and I hated most of their sense of humor. Miles I found to be particularly annoying especially due to his high pitched, whiny voice acting. Am I playing as a 17 year old or an obnoxious little kid with a high pitched voice? When your main characters and antagonists are this bad, that is a big issue. Verdict: This game is not bad, but it's not great either. Obviously I'm in the minority here so you may really like it because it does have some good things going for it, but some of these characters and enemies just didn't do it for me at all. My score: 6/10"

Human Fall Flat,"Adventure, Casual, Indie, Simulation","Definitely, worth a try with the friends. I am not a person who likes the physics games but this game isn’t bad with the friends. However, if you try to finish the game, you will get annoyed, because of the limited design of the gameplay. Developers are really looking after their game still though; they are adding free new levels to the game. Honestly, watching the game is a bit more fun but it is still a decent game to play."

Raft,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation",A very fun and unique survival game. This is open world survival done right. It's also a lot of fun co-op. Recommended all around.
Raft,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation","J'ai Raft depuis si longtemps qu'il devait me rester des cheveux, j'aimais bien le principe mais très vite à l'époque ses faiblesses s'étaient fait ressentir : passé le bac à sable et la découverte des premières îles un peu plus grande, il n'y avait pas grand chose à faire. Quelle fut donc ma surprise en novembre 2022, quatre ans après son lancement, quand je l'ai relancé ! De nouveaux persos qu'il faudra débloquer pour jouer, des nouveaux matériaux et objets, de la déco à gogo. L'ambiance mystérieuse est bien représentée, le jeu sans être dans l'horreur (heureusement, je déteste ça perso) vous offre son petit lot de frissons, l'histoire y est intéressante et la coopération, bien que plus sympathique pour profiter du jeu, n'est pas obligatoire. Cerise sur le McDo : les difficultés. Que vous soyez casu de l'éternel ou gros hardcore g@m3rz, vous y trouverez votre compte puisque le jeu va vous proposer des principes de difficultés allant de ""tout est calme, le requin ne vous attaque pas, chillez tranquille sur l'eau"" à ""LE DERNIER QUI SURVIT PENSE A ENVOYER UNE LETTRE A MA MERE"". Blague à part, c'est plaisant, il n'y a pas de wiki à apprendre par coeur pour en profiter et chacun.es y trouvera son expérience dans ce style de jeu."
Raft,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation","Absolutely perfect, there's a path you should follow and this is awesome. World things are really realistic and it makes things enjoyable And also Nice soundtrack Recommended for chilling with friends :D"
Raft,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation",Very Good.
Raft,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation",♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ seagull
Raft,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation","Me and my girlfriend (we're lesbians) can't find a game that we are able to play multiplayer with, that keeps us entertained for hours. Now we have the game and we appreciate it so much. I wish islands were more bigger to explore to. I wish that there's a quickselect button so you can easily eat what you have on your inventory. I cant also destroy crafted furniture like purifier or grills to acquire the items i used with it. I wish we could dress up our characters. ♥♥♥♥ old shoes and plastics, but it gives us awareness of the pollution in the sea. Thanks and Kudos RedBeet and Axolot <3"
Raft,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation","Great game, Would have given a Positive review if they supported 4k and at least 2k 2560. its 2021 and no 4k support or even 2k?!? Pathetic. Not gonna play in 1080 like some broke ass simp. Refunded"
Raft,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation",perfect game
Raft,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation",Sucks
Raft,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation","Similar to the Forest, a decent game to play with friends. Again, story part is pretty boring and tedious. Story islands are platformers with some puzzles for the most of the time and the last island is something. We had to return to the raft multiple times to stock some food and water at the last island (during boss fight, after the puzzle) which was designed really poorly as resources and the boss fight part. Also, combat does not feel good but I guess it is not a huge problem in this game. Crafting is decent but gathering resources gets harder after a while which is a bit annoying. If gathering resources was easier, I think the game would be much more fun to play; since we were 4 players and we needed more resources at the raft (game does not give you more for more players sadly), because of that we had to wait to be able to find the required resources for building. Still, it is worth a try, especially with the price of it."
Days Gone,"Action, Adventure",Not fun.
Days Gone,"Action, Adventure","This is one of the most boring, uninteresting games I have ever played. If you are buying this game just for some fun zombie combat, don't. The controls are extremely clunky and the zombies take more of a backseat to the human enemies. The only fun part of this game is running away from the massive zombie hoards however I got about halfway through the main campaign and that only happened a handful of times. I will not be finishing this game and honestly wish I have never bought it. 4/10."
Days Gone,"Action, Adventure","Days Gone is an underrated former PlayStation exclusive, and stands as a great reason to see more console exclusives come to PC. Maybe we could get a sequel! (Played at 4K, max settings using an AMD RX 6800 XT, Ryzen 3800X and 32 GB RAM) This review is based on a complete, blind playthrough on Normal difficulty. Gameplay: 7/10 - Good, standard feeling gunplay mechanics slightly hindered by repetition. Story: 7.5/10 - A slightly unique take on the zombie apocalypse genre, with the later-game story elements really taking the prize. Some parts of the early third act felt a little slow. Graphics: 8/10 - Visually great and well optimized UE4 performance. My card doesn't break a sweat nor drop frames fighting large late-game hordes at 4K 60 fps. Music and sound design: 7/10 - You hear a lot of the same freaker noises over the course of one playthrough. The sound effects are nothing special, but the world sound is great and accurately represents the spirit of the PNW. Replayability: 5/10 - I'm not particularly fond of replaying large, open world games, but the game does have a NG+ mechanic that seems to be available immediately after starting the game. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone, even at full price. The game does feel hampered in some aspects, especially the survival elements (filling up gas, repairing the bike, etc.) where it feels like the developers wanted to do more but were restricted by budgets or scheduling. The character and world design were inspired and well-executed. Deacon St. John is a great character that never felt like a self-insert, but rather I was controlling a character with his own desires, concerns, and motives. His relationship with Boozer and other characters along the way are expertly crafted, and even his open world dialogue constantly made me wonder about how he was as a character in between the time of the prologue and main story. The main story itself was overall enjoyable and well written, though the vanilla ending may leave some people unsatisfied as, to me, it felt a little abrupt. HOWEVER, if you play this game, be sure to complete the epilogue missions! I won't say much as to why, but you will be missing out on some story bombs if you don't."
Days Gone,"Action, Adventure",it's a very long ride
Days Gone,"Action, Adventure","Bad acting combined with a shallow, badly slapped together story arc. Playable only when you have time to kill and no other game to play. Buy on hard sale, not just 25%, like 70% or more. Has a ton of bugs all around the place, turned on trainer to actually make the game playable and bearable. My score would be 55-65%."
Days Gone,"Action, Adventure",basically the last of us for pc with open world biking
Days Gone,"Action, Adventure",game mechanics are amazing the zombies are super scary and taking on hordes is super fun
Days Gone,"Action, Adventure",When I first heard of Days Gone I stuck my nose up at it mainly because I was kinda tired of zombie games. Yes I feel like everyone can agree that the zombie fatigue is real and very much alive but eventually you get a game that actually makes zombies somewhat fun. Days Gone is a prime example of how to make zombies cool mainly because they are treated more or less like an obstacle or set dressing. Yes you will kill a lot of zombies in this game but beneath the infected corpses of the recently departed rests an amazing story that is gracefully carried by an excellent cast and game world and honestly Bend Studio deserves a lot of praise for this especially with the lead character Deacon. I say definitely pick it up and give it a go but be aware that the game does have a relatively slow start.
Days Gone,"Action, Adventure",good

Yakuza 4 Remastered,"Action, Adventure",Best male barbie game on the block.
Gunpoint,"Action, Indie, Strategy",Very nice but very short (I completed it in 4 hours). Thumb up but only when on sale...
Gunpoint,"Action, Indie, Strategy",I love this game’s jazz soundtrack but it bugs me how they managed to compose jazz before it was invented in Persona 5
Shatterline,"Action, Massively Multiplayer, Free To Play, Early Access","The game isn't bad, but I tend to leave NO as a recommendation for any neutral reviews of mine. Engine is great, the game runs well and even the shooting feels fine. There are two different aspects of the game, PvE and PvP - both which reward you with in-game progress (unlocks & upgrades). I was pulled to the game via the roguelike PvE-experience in a 3 man team. While there's a lot to go on there, different characters and their builds with their two active skills and various passives you keep unlocking, the main issue is that the game repeats itself in a tedious manner. It's arena fight after arena fight all of which ""require"" three players to be present. The experience of these rounds does not get better the further you spend with the game, but the other way around. It's even more stale."
The Signal From Tölva,Action,"The graphics are Borderlands level which is quite good, but gameplay is dull, storyline is inexistent, fighting is easy and repetative. You just walk around clunking away for hours and hours fighting semi-stupid droids on your way and collecting rewards. Quite pointless, a loss of time."
The Signal From Tölva,Action,"Recommended only for people looking for a very leisurely stroll through an interesting sci-fi world and story. Even though I did not enjoy this game, I am still giving it a thumbs up, because it is well crafted and interesting and may appeal to some people. The world has a decent amount of cool and interesting things to look at. I enjoyed the sci-fi theme of the world and the story interested me, but combat and quest areas have a LOT of walking in between. I only recommend this game for folks who like exploring a world and looking around. If you prefer games that have minimal downtime or you don't enjoy just taking in the scenery, or you're not sure or you're on the fence, then I recommend you pass."
Mafia,"Action, Adventure",Old but fun. Plus they are remaking it. You might as well just wait for the three months for the remastered version.

Battlefield™ 2042,"Action, Adventure, Casual","Its a bit closer to battlefield 4 than previous entries. environmental disasters make a fun come back and the portal mode offers some content from BF3, Bad Company 2 and 1942 making this a good buy whether you want to experience the wacky new gadgets and maps or just relax in some lobbies that have your most nostalgic maps."
Battlefield™ 2042,"Action, Adventure, Casual","After experiencing a lot of hours I think I can have the right to type the good and the bad sides of the game. First of all, I have to tell you that the game is almost not playable unless if you don't have a well working SSD. (Doesn't matter M.2 or SATA) Battlefield franchise has been going down since the last titles of the series. When Battlefield 2042 first released, People said that the game is literally unplayable in every sides. But the good thing is that THE GAME HAS BEEN FIXED TECHNICALLY RIGHT NOW. You don't usually see technical problems if you have a good setup. THE GOOD SIDES AND ITS FEATURES 1-) Playing Sundance and Mackay is actually so fun in Conquest that you can even flank the enemies from behind and get a lot of frags. 2-)The game has faster gameplay mechanics compared to older titles. Which means you can get the fastest kills. Depends on your gameplay but I like it. 3-)Some of Rifles and guns are really cool to play. Rate of fires are much higher compared to BF3 and 4. 4-)Squad Revive. It's not a new feature but I find it ok to include in the series. 5-)Changing Gun attachments is a game changer if you can change and play it correctly. 6-)Cross Play and 128 player servers. Both of them were not really necessary but they make us find the servers easier. 7-)You can finally see how much people there are in the objectives you're playing in (Teammates and enemies). 8-)You can call for a vehicle while you're running as an infantry in that damn vehicle based maps such as Hourglass and Renewal. But it needs a free slot to call it. So sometimes you have to wait for it or give it up. 9-)Battle Pass is worth paying if you only wanna get a lot of xp booster and Battlefield coins as the game refunds some of them as a progression reward. THE BAD SIDES (unfortunately) 1-)The game literally does not have official server browser and choosing the maps you want to play. In that case, It's all RNG. There is only one way to change the maps is that when you click the game mode you're willing to play, the game counts 5 to 0. When it has found a server and in that moment, you can cancel searching the game if you don't want that map. For Example: If you are getting Hourglass and don't want to play it, Then cancel searching the game and try it again until you find a good one. No comment on that. 2-)Sometimes (at least for me) I'm getting black screen when I first launch the game. I have searched a lot of forums, threads and topics in order to fix it but couldn't find any working solution. 3-)There is no team switching. 4-)The game has only 2 countries. Which is not a cool thing to me as Battlefield 4 had 3 countries in it. (Battlefield 1 had 9) 5-) I have mentioned the SSD requirement above. 6-)Sometimes (again) the game is not loading the main menu when leaving the server. It got stuck in Black screen like I got in the first launch. But despite everything, I kinda liked the game. At least It's playable. You should give it a try if you have a good setup and curious about 2042. Thank you for reading."

Battlefield™ 2042,"Action, Adventure, Casual",THIS GAME IS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GARBAGE I HOPE EA DICE CLOSED DOWN THE GAME IS CHEATER INFESTED IN ASIA. EA IS DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT THE GAME HAVE HAVE MOUSE INPUT PROBLEM THAT NEVER BEEN FIX SINCE BETA THE GAME LACK FEATURES FROM PAST TITLE THE GAME HAS THE WORST MAP DESIGN IN HISTORY OF BATTLEFIELD
Battlefield™ 2042,"Action, Adventure, Casual","Its a bad game, 2042 wasn't made with any actual passion or plan in mind other than to serve as a vehicle to sell DLC as a hero shooter. I might have been able to look past the abolition of the class system if they didnt make it a hero shooter too, I dont care about specialists, I think they look stupid,  I dont want to play as an Indian hacker or a Sharlto Copely Bushwookie,  If the game is going to force this dumb US vs RU story in climate change armageddon 2042.. I want to just create my own US and RU soldiers. Besides being extremely poorly thought out,  its just a bad game, Portal is not what its cracked up to be at all,  few maps, only a paltry example of weapons,  just awful. I hate my friends for pressuring me into buying this,  I could have just played halo for free.  they ended up quitting the game before the public version even launched.  I eventually got a refund, and I'll never be back. Goodnight sweet prince,  Battlefield is dead."

ORION: Prelude,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG",Not playable. Got it on sale and still feeling robbed
Divinity II: Developer's Cut,RPG,"Like the other 2 Larian games I've played - Its a complete mess of poor writing, awkward quests with little to no leads, quest items marked as junk, clunky or messy combat, poor ai, bugs galore and just a general amateur look and feel to the game. I mean ffs, you can transform into a dragon....but can't attack enemies on land. Pretty much sums up the level of professional quality of their games. I don't mind paying XP for mind reading, but the way the game is setup you feel as if you're being gimped.  I have yet to find a place where enemies respawn so I can train up on them if I hit a brick wall. They did this half assed explorer minion thing when you get the tower, so the money is covered a little - that and there isn't much worth spending it on.  I've maybe purchased 5 pieces of gear so far. I will give them props for having full voice acting, although I imagine that was added in for the director's cut and not the original release. Tough sell, buy on mega discount only. Seriously, I came here to review after my first load screen crash - and from reading the other reviews....I expect a lot more while trying to finish the game....In 2023."

Garry's Mod,"Casual, Indie, Simulation","5k hours, nuff said"
Garry's Mod,"Casual, Indie, Simulation","It's hard to accurately describe WHAT Garry's Mod is as a video game. If anything: It's a platform thanks to the ease of downloading a seemingly infinite number of user-created models/toys/vehicles/weapons/what-have-you to play with. There are no goals to Gmod's default sandbox mode. Everything is limited by your imagination, which is a good and bad thing. Good in the sense that creativity is rewarded with the creation of silly, yet potentially complex contraptions which you can drive, detonate, ride, fling etc. But bad in the sense of how well game with no goal can keep you occupied for an extended period of time. The real fun of Garry's Mod spawns from building your own enjoyment with your friends! Multiplayer is where this game truely shines, allowing for a massive level of server modding and customisation. You're not only restricted to building stuff in this game. Want to play a game of who-dunnit where detectives try to discover discreet murderers among their ranks? Want to watch Youtube videos in a virtual cinema with friends? Hide and seek? Roleplay? Survival? All of this and more is avaliable thanks to Gmod's incredible modding community. Unfortunately, to gain the full experience from this title, other Source games like Counter-Strike: Source and Half-Life 2 are strongly recommended to make use of their assets. You have to find your own fun with Garry's Mod, but once you've found it expect your play time to skyrocket."

Fallout 2: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game,RPG,nice
Fallout 2: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game,RPG,"One of my favorite games, a timeless classic. Contrary to modern fallout games this game gives you a real freedom. Killing or helping everyone, a more realistic and satisfying writing even if it is older than 20 years. Game has lots of postmodern elements like fourth wall, intermedias and etc. At the same, it has a great sense of dark humor. For me, it was the most detailed game I've ever seen, contrary to new generation Bethesda-Fallout games. Probably Fallout 2  has more choices (I'm not talking about fake choices) and more impacts to gameplay than any RPG you have ever seen. However, it is a really buggy game, especially with the endings and some quests. I recommend checking common bugs and using more than at least three save slots, maybe using unoffical patches. By the way last major town is a bit rushed because of the developemental problems, so that town's text isn't strong as other town. Plus there are some content which was cut and for that reason there are some meaningless parts and there can be some temporary FPS drop when you move to a new area at the map. P.S: This game one of the rare ones: It criticises American supremacy and their acts for playing the police enforcement of the world."

Killing Floor 2,Action,"Great game thus far. From the gore to graphics this game is a blast to play, especially with friends. However, things I hope to see in the finished product are: 1. More weapons along with modifications for them,  since there are only 4 weapons per class with no modifications available. 2. More maps, as there are only 3 so far. 3. More enemy variations along with new bosses, since there is only 1 boss as of now."

Killing Floor 2,Action,"Bob the builder can he fix it, bob the builder yeah he can."
Killing Floor 2,Action,I usually try to avoid updating reviews but this needs to be said although the entire community has said it for me. Tripwire has successfully flushed their reputation down the toilet with these stupid updates and creative decisions that have pretty much ruined this game. Adding in weapons that you need to pay for isn't uncommon since they did it in the first game but 10$ for a single weapon is utter heresy and why is that? Because the entire zedconomy they created hasn't made enough money? Nah ♥♥♥♥ off with that. However they can make Maneater an EPIC exclusive that they were compensated for which just reeks of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. With all that money they made from EPIC they may want to buy some mouthwash to help get the taste of EPICs ♥♥♥♥ out of their mouth and maybe reevaluate their position in this industry.
Killing Floor 2,Action,l4d with bosses plus the perks system is great
Killing Floor 2,Action,"nope. cant recommend a game that bows to cancel culture. to instill a sense of dread by firing for wrong think. for demanding conformity. despite making VIDEO GAMES about KILLING ZOMBIES real world politcal issuse seem to seep into the very fabric of the cutlure of the game and infects with a liberal biased agenda ROT! developers who share their opinion, their ""wrong think"" can be canceled in less then 24 hours, how can anyone be ok with that? publishers are fascists and need to be broken down into an unbiased source of resource otherwise, no one will ever be free."

METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"Action, Adventure","I will do a full review later, but this is by far one of the best games to come out this year, if not the best game to have come out this year so far. The clunky controls of previous Metal Gear Solids are gone. This games stealth, tactical and shooting mechanics are some of the best I have ever used, and when I was only about 5 hours in I had already built a modest base, recruited a small army and adopted a puppy. And nothing beats blasting music from your chopper as it flys down over the middle eastern desert turning soviet bases into glass."

METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"Action, Adventure","This was the only Metal Gear game I've ever played, it was a lot of fun. But some of the story and plot details aren't very newcomer friendly. Was also a little dissapointed in the fact that there were only two regions.  And the Game was released with the final mission cut, In hindsight. MGSV reminds me a lot of Farcry 2. A huge , pretty open world to fight lots of people in. but the world isn't very ""Dynamic"",  No civilians or factions, just an entire country full of people who shoot you on sight. Still a good game though."

Factorio,"Casual, Indie, Simulation, Strategy","Let's cut to the chase: - I don't know what I am doing - I am in over my depth - My head is spinning trying to solve a problem in the game - to solve one problem, there are another 3 to solve before you can address that one - From what I have seen, i have only scratched the surface - I will probably never be good at the game as I don't have the time to really delve into it - I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE ABOVE BECASUE I AM LOVING THE GAME!!!!!!!!!!!! Factorio is addictive. As I have stated, I have really only scratched the surface of the game. I have really tried hard to avoid looking up any tutorials or YouTube clips and so far have stuck to that fairly well. I want to figure this stuff out myself. So, that said, I am still on the second or third level of the campaign - something but probably should only take about half an hour (? no idea - never compared to anything) but I am easily up to 10+hours just on that alone (and I now think I need to start again!) The game will do your head in but in a good way. There is something very rewarding about nutting out a manufacturing chain that works. Watching all your bits humm along and progress is made. The tutorial is ok, it gives you enough but it's not a lot. Kinda like saying, ""Did you know nuclear power is very complicated. Now, here's some uranium and some bricks, off you go then!"" That said, it worked. The campaign ramps things up significantly and seems to act as a more advanced tutorial. BUt this ain't baby steps, more like giant leaps. BUt it has worked and I am loving the challnege. When I couldn't figure out one thing, I looked at some YouTube clips and saw technologies and features WAAAAAAAY beyond what I am up to - and I already feel barely in control. The crafting system is pretty easy and unlike other crafting based games, you don't need to use time wasting trial and error to discover recipes. They are all there which makes things so much easier. Want to build an ""x""? Hover over the icon and it will tell you it needs some ""a's"" and ""b's"" to make it. It gets tricky when the ""a's"" need ""c's"" and ""d's"" to be built and thus, the complexity and mind breaking begins. You will love this game if you like exploratory, survival, crafting games that really make you think. As I said in my intro, I won't ever be an expert a tthe game but I am loving the almost perfect learning curve - it's hard but not alienating. I'm NEVER bored. It's not treating me like a baby with breadcrumbs through every possible action. Let's be honest, there is a lot this game does not tell you, but it's not impossible for a regular Joe like me to nut it out...eventually. Can't wait to see where this game goes....scared to see where this game goes given what it has already!"
Factorio,"Casual, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Great game !
Zoeti,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy","While not that impressed at first, seeing it as just a weaker take on Poker Quest, the game's mechanics eventually won me over.  Choosing which spells are triggered by which poker hand lead to a lot of interesting synergies.  Like do you take the spell for a given poker hand that synergiezes best or maybe another spell that doesn't synergize as well but you've managed to level up much more from the random level rewards?"
Zoeti,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy","A mediocre card game that is not actually a deckbuilder. You gain equipment that makes poker hands have extra effects, but the base set of cards never changes. However the game's biggest problem is it's just not interesting. You are presented with a lot of choices as you play, but all that does is present a false sense of variety. There are only a few equipment slot and each has only a tiny set of options. Artifacts that provide buffs are offered semi-frequently but impactful ones are few and far between. There are other minor issues - poorly themed cards (when only using 1-7 why employ clubs etc. when a more thematic choice like animals or elements would have worked) and poor writing (story is fine, but the banter was inane and endless so I ended up skipping everything). But really the only thing that matters is that the lack of deep choices means the game isn't fun to play. There are many actual deckbuilders that are much more fun than this game. Or if you prefer the poker deck theme I'd recommend Aces & Adventures, and Balatro is currently quite popular."
McPixel 3,"Adventure, Casual, Indie","This is one of the stupidest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ games I have ever played in my entire life, but DAAAAAMN was it fun. 11 hours that felt like 2. McPixel 3 is a great game, sadly, it is NOT EVEN CLOSE to the monumental achievement that is McPixel 2 (which I accidentally found in an ominous blue floppy disk that appeared on some street dog's poop). Some of the puzzles are just completely impure, it breaks you, it speaks to someone or something deep inside you, or maybe it's just some cabbage I ate earlier, idk. But coming from someone that majorly dislikes Point-and-Click games, this is something else. Just play it, it's major loads of fun. Thank you Sos, and have a great day you too :)"

A Short Hike,"Adventure, Indie",im evil
A Short Hike,"Adventure, Indie",Sweet :)
A Short Hike,"Adventure, Indie","I finally got around to sitting down and playing A Short Hike last night, and before I knew it I was halfway through it. Not because it's all that short of a trip, but because it pulled me in, letting me forget time and stress. Gaming has been a tough proposition for me lately. Between stress, loud neighbors driving me to insomnia again this past month and a general sense of uneasiness preventing me from just starting up a new game , it's been difficult for me to simply sit down and enjoy what's coming for me. That's the situation I was in for a long while with this game: Keeping it installed for months, but never feeling in the right mindset to properly appreciate what has been widely regarded as a great, earnest indie title. Booting it up was more on a whim than any conscious decision on my part. I just happened to do it. And then I didn't quit for ages, something few games these days achieve. And even when I reached a point where I thought I had enough for the time being.... it didn't last. I went out to get a cup of hot chocolate, go to the bathroom, and when I got back to the PC, I found myself just booting the game back up. Even when I found myself getting frustrated on being two seconds over the required boat race time for an achievement (and knowing it was my own silly mistake that cost me that victory!) I only shut it down for maybe half an hour, watching a brief video on Youtube, before going back to the island and trying again. And succeeding. I finished the entire game in a single night, sans a PC clock-dependent achievement I unlocked just a bit ago, putting the game officially at 100% completion. And I feel myself both happy at the short, unhurried, relaxing experience, and wishing there had been another adventure to bring me back right now. Turns out I was wrong. You don't need the perfect mindset to go into A Short Hike. You just need to bring yourself to attend - the game does the rest. It'll put you in that bright mindset through its own charms, its character writing, the atmosphere of the island and its lack of intrinsic pressures. It'll go at your pace, instead of demanding you make that effort yourself. It'll leave you to wander and explore, to meet characters that turn out to be lovable, quirky people that - at the end of the day - mean nobody any harm. There are no debbie downers - even characters you may instinctively dislike (scalping is bad, yo) turn out to have valid, personal reasons for doing what they're doing... and when you offer them kindness instead of bitterness, you both win. I think that's my biggest takeaway from A Short Hike: The kindness within every single person you meet. No matter how competitive they might be, they're never malicious. They'll support their rivals instead of wallowing in Schadenfreude. They'll reflect on their own actions and choices, their own preconceptions. They'll overcome self-doubt with the help of a little bit of encouragement from the player-character Claire. Claire herself may start out feeling a little snarky and disinterested in her surroundings - you could even say cynical - but once she steps out of the house and goes on her hike, she starts to see the island and the people inhabiting it the way it actually is: Beautiful and harmonious. I was lucky enough to share both that sense of trepidation going into the game, and that sense of wonder inherent in its exploration. And reaching the top of the mountain, I felt kinship with Claire - we made this hike a success! It was only then that I recalled the reason for it all when Claire's phone rang, right there at the peak - the only point with cellphone reception on the island. And I cried over the dialogue that followed. It was a sort of fulfillment that made the experience all the more worthwhile. It explained Claire's initial frustration, while framing it not as rooted in boredom or a rejection of the island, but instead in her kind heart. It made all the friends made along the way feel even more meaningful in hindsight. But the game didn't end there. With the climb achieved, I felt like the island opened up to me even more than before - when really, it hadn't changed, outside of character dialogue advancing here and there. I'd achieved Claire's own, personal goal... but there were still others who hadn't fulfilled their own. And I got to help them getting there now. By the end of the adventure, Claire has the chance to talk to her aunt back at their cabin. She tells her of this and that adventure, all things you could achieve throughout the game. She's gushing about what a great time she had. And both Claire and myself could've gone on for far longer than she actually did in those lines of dialogue. Because there were more little things not explicitly mentioned, more meaningful moments, treasures, people, experiences that I was happy I had made that night I beat A Short Hike on a whim."

Fall Guys,"Action, Casual, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, Sports",piece of garbage why did i get it why tell me. joel why did you make me buy this
Fall Guys,"Action, Casual, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, Sports","At last, they've decided to require an additional layer of account-based DRM starting with Season 6: EGS. This was sadly inevitable after the development studio was purchased by Epic a while back, after their explosive hit launch. So Fall Guys is firmly going the way of the dodo, requiring an off-site account, changing the TOS over a year after launch, and as a result, I will not even be able to play the product I originally purchased, as I will not be sharing my personal & analytical data with Epic Games. A pity that a refund will not be forthcoming, same as it wasn't when Rocket League pulled this same stunt a few years back."
Fall Guys,"Action, Casual, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, Sports",cute and fun party game.
Fall Guys,"Action, Casual, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, Sports",This game is fun but not for long periods of time. It gets really repetitive after a few hours.

Battlefield 4™,Action,'
Battlefield 4™,Action,"Current state of the game isn't what it used to be since it's flooded with sweats and max level people so be prepared to get outgunned in pretty much every gunfight if your low level or don't have the best guns or equipment to use. I can't even count the number of times I shot at someone up close with a point blank shotgun hit or assault rifle (landing all shots) and I still lose the gun fight because the enemy is hopping around every 2 seconds and using an AEK or ACE 23, which are undoubtedly the 2 best guns in the game by far and they still take a considerate about of my playtime to unlock both. Of course, in typical EA fashion, you can just pay your way to unlock everything which defeats one of the main fun aspects of the multiplayer. DICE undoubtedly makes incredible FPS games but EA also finds a way to put their filth in everything they touch. It's also a jump fest because spamming jump and running means your immune to get shot at basically and your aim/accuracy tightens up. Also, playing this version with a controller compared to other versions of the game is a huge letdown and slap in the face because you get zero aim assist and there's no option to put controller icons onto the game so even if your playing with controller, your constantly seeing key bind prompts to do things in the game as if your playing with a keyboard. A big positive is that this game was incredibly easy to run/optimized for me but visuals don't mean a whole lot if the gun and player balance is too lopsided."

CODE VEIN,"Action, RPG","The game is fine, but I will never, ever recommend a game that is simply broken and left as is. I was playing this thing, and then I simply could not activate the elevator, I didn't knew why. Searching the Steam Forums, I sadly found out why... The game has a few framecap options for 30, 60, 144, and 240, yet, if you play anything above 60FPS, the damage scaling is broken and the elevators do not work... Like... I am not adding a mod, not editing an INI, I am not breaking the game, I am literally using an option that is literally in the options menu, and the game does not work. Also, the game is super smooth in 144hz, and in 60hz it is not smooth at all. Some games work at 60, but that is not the case here, it's a massive downgrade in the gameplay feel. Considering the studio had no effort to fix this, I will not have any effort playing it. If it gets fixed in the future I may try it, the character creation is among the best and I really wanted to take that character for a spin."
CODE VEIN,"Action, RPG","So, I just beat the game and my final veredict on it would be BUY IT Why should you? well, because: 1. The game is visually appealing : at least if you're into anime, manga and stuff like that. Hell, if you weren't you wouldn't be even considering buying this game, thus, not being on this page, but I digress. Stylish characters, stylish weapons, stylish skills and combos and stylish armor designs makes this treat to your eyes. 2. It is fun in multiplayer : One of the most crucial points that made me buy this game is the MP, sadly it doesn't have PVP, but the coop is quite good, specially because you can ""summon"" someone anywhere without the need of a ""sign"" on the ground, making it quick to have somebody to watch your back agains't those nasty terrors, yikes! 3. The soundtrack is full of jams AND neat sound effects : From orchestrated music to some light pop-eletronic-something music and the good ol' rock'n roll, this game has it all, so not only you will be very pleased by how the game looks, but also by how it sounds. The sound of the hammer pounding the ground or your sword slashing through a horror is something that will not be leaving my mind so shortly. 4. They really put INTELLIGENCE in that AI thing : Your NPC partners in this game are quiite smart. Yakumo pointed some really cool items for my, as well enemy placements that I wasn't aware of, and that really helped keeping me alive, when I switched to long reange weaponry to fight a distant enemy, Yakumo quickly assumed a defensive stance and positioned himself in front of me so he could take the shots in my stead. I believe I fell in love with him 5. Lego, but with skills Yo man, you can really create some cool builds in this game, not in the same way as Soulsborne titles, by allocating points to certain stats so you could raise determined parameter, all of your level ups in here are the same as traditional JRPGs, you get all of your stats sorted out automatically. Yeah, I know, I loved the autonomy too, but don't worry, because in here you can collect a lot, no, really, A LOT of ""Blood Codes"", which are ""part of the memories of other characters"" carried by their blood that can make you inherit their skills, and there are more than a 150. Yes, 150 skills. But every game has it's flaws, and Code Vein is a part of this. Why? Well, because: 1. I swear I've seen that enemy somewhere before : Yep, you did, the same horrors you face in the beginning will be fighting you at the end, sometimes with a change in the color pallete, while most of the time it'll be the same copy and paste. 2. Why am I the only one growing up here? : You fight Terrors, you earn ""Haze"", the ""currency and exp"" in this game and then you level up. Noice, but why I cannot do that to my partners? 3. Fire the architecht that designed all of this : You like mazes? me neither, specially because my memory sucks and I always get lost at it, even if I just beat it. Well, the level design here is kinda lackluster in a way, since all it does is put mazes in front of you. Not a game breaker, just a minor issue. 4. Naw man, get outta there, I can totally see you! : If you've played any Soulsborne games, you may already be familiarized with the enemy placement of the franchise, and nothing changes here. Sad. Yeah, I know, the game has quite it's share of flaws, but hey, it is fun, I've enjoyed it and I even plan on getting all of the achievements in here, since I wanna see all of those endings, cuz doods, the story is quite yummy."

PlanetSide 2,"Action, Massively Multiplayer, Free To Play","I'm gonna make this short and sweet,  because I have a long and storied history with Planetside 2. And I could rant about a dozen things,  gonna focus on two, though I got banned on this game before, back in like 2013 or something.. And while I later proved myself innocent of any wrongdoing that a Game Manager accused me of,  I've never forgotten how easy it is to get perma-banned just for being good at the game and pissing off the wrong whiner. I put about $500 or more into this game, I loved it back in the day.  But I fear the game's gonna go tits up soon.  When I joined there was like 18 servers. Admittedly way too many.  so they knocked it down to like 2 on each coast,  2 in europe and 1 in oceania. Now,  North America has 2 servers.  they are constantly either imbalanced in population (Looking at you, VS). or due to the locking mechanic and there never being more than 2 Continents open,  it's not uncommon to log on and be thrown onto Koltyr for 15 minutes just to get in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game! This game really went to hell for me when my outfit from Mattherson quit,   I think now I just play it for the sake of making use of the money I spent,   and admittedly I am pretty good at it since there appear to be a lot of noobs playing it.  I've had it since day 1, afterall."

Company of Heroes 2,Strategy,"right then, time to earn to bing chilling"
Company of Heroes 2,Strategy,"I'll just make it clear that I haven't actually enjoyed an RTS game from Relic since Dawn of War Dark Crusade. But speaking of Company of Heroes 1 and 2,  I never liked it.  I think the map scale is small and awkward,  the battles focus on fighting over pointless resource hubs,  the combat itself feels fake as units just blast at each other for what seems like an eternity,   and the unit pool is very small. And speaking of the unit pool,  I cant support or reccomend any game that nickel and dimes dozens of unit packs out as DLC. I dont like the company that develops it anymore, but go play a Men of War game.  at least you're getting a complete package when you buy their games. COH2 is just dawn of war 2 with a WW2 skin. and that game was a joke."
Company of Heroes 2,Strategy,"it would be better if it had micro management, but still an awesome game. good for seasoned strategists, excellent multiplayer"
Company of Heroes 2,Strategy,Free on humblebundle https://www.humblebundle.com/store/company-of-heroes-2?hmb_source=companyofheroes2_freegame&hmb_medium=banner
Company of Heroes 2,Strategy,"I loved the first game but second game is really annoying. Another classy act of Relic of leaving the game. Theater of War missions are plain annoying. They don’t offer much and as a single player-player I like to finish the game but if a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Soviet tank can hit your Tiger at the front more than you hit it from the side, there is a huge problem. Without a story and the balance Theater of War was a chore for me. Other than these, you can buy commanders and with those, you can use different capabilities. Some units are only available with these commanders; you can buy commanders grinding but it takes a lot of time and why would someone like me (single player-player) grind those to play against AI? If you like to buy cosmetics, you can buy them at the store too. Another problem is poor AI. Only challenge it offers cheating its way to more resources and spamming units. It charges to machine guns from the frontside, yet winning against it is a real challenge. If I continue to list problems with this game, next thing at the list would be biased and boring story. Contrary to first game, this game’s story is about villainy which is Soviet Union’s, even the Axis soldiers feel more humane than them. Plus, the campaign is broken. In addition to that, lots of achievements are also broken. You can get most of them with mods -thanks to kind and caring modders- but 3 of them are impossible; so, you can’t achieve 100%. There is a petition about it but of course Relic prefers to ignore it. Lastly, there is continuous toxicity at multiplayer games and discussion."
Company of Heroes 2,Strategy,"I can only imagine the feeling when you pay $40 for a game, only to go in and find every shred of content is DLC. I got this in a Humble Bundle, so the cards probably make up the portion I paid for it, but I was disappointed to find that I'd essentially bought a platform without even the smallest campaign to get me into the game. My only option after a very mechanistic game tutorial was AI or online playing, or online paying. Or card farming, which is what I did."
Company of Heroes 2,Strategy,"Praktisch ist es ein COH 1 mit besserer Grafik, der Spielspaß ebbt aber schon nach wenigen Stunden ab. Hauptnegativpunkte: - Extrem freche DLC Politik: selbst wenn man die Complete Edition kauft ist das Game noch nicht vollständig...ich sage nur Ingame Käufe von Generälen und Perks - Sehr unübersichtliches und wenig funktionierendes Multiplayer Menü"

Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days,Action,THE AESTHETIC FOR ME FORGIVES EVERY OTHER SIN THIS GAME COMMITS
Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days,Action,liveleak
Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days,Action,"I've played a lot of bad games, even intentionally, as I always have believed there's things to be learned and even found humor in just how bad it is. But let me tell you, there is not one. single. redeeming thing about Kane & Lynch 2. For some reason, the developers went with this idea to have a cameraman follow K&L in the journey, however, neither characters ever acknowledge that this camera man exists. When it's the three of you in an elevator, one of them explicitly says 'We're just two white guys in an elevator', so one might think maybe this camera man doesn't actually exist? Except for the fact that when they get captured, one of the police comes over an puts his hands over the camera, acknowledging that this is infact a real person. So why does this camera man exist? They exist solely to provide the most nauseating experience in gaming. It's a cameraman with full on parkinson's disease with the framing ability of an orangutan. Every cutscene is dealt with dizzying camera movements, wildly spinning around in circles, typically pointed at nothing in particular, and removing you from the ability to actually see what is happening, like someone came from the school of the Bourne series. The game also censors nudity and headshots (but not all headshots) as if I'm watching this video on  youtube, and the loading icon is the buffering icon in case you needed to be reminded that you could be watching something more entertaining on youtube instead. There's several types of guns in this game, pistols which are fairly competent, sub machine guns which feel like I'm shooting a garden hose when pointed at any target that is greater than 10 feet away. Assault rifles that are the go to, shotguns for when it's 30 minutes in the game and you could've swore the weapon icon showed that it wasn't a shotgun. Sniper rifles that don't have a scoped sight despite enemies getting scopes when they aim at you, and a couple of others. This is a cover based shooter where cover occasionally will just do nothing at all and you’ll still get blasted by the enemies directly in front of you. Also I had dozens of occasions where I would literally see them spawn in by just popping into existence. They gave you a sprinting ability in this game, which immediately makes the game look like it's being thrown through a dryer cycle. Half the time you can't see enemies approaching or even what direction you are going in. One might think to simply not use it then, however the game throws numerous large open fields that you can either spend triple the time going through or just deal with quick motion sickness. Oh and there's numerous chase and 'hurry up' sequences throughout the game. It's unavoidable. During the numerous shootouts, K&L incoherently shout at each other despite how small of a room they are in or close they are to each other, and as if they constantly need to remind the audience (or the camera man) who is who. The typical dialog exchange goes as follows. ""KANE!"" ""LYNCH! ""I CAN'T DO THIS KANE AGHFBHTH!"" ""SHOOT THEM LYNCH"" I want to point out that I did not do a typo, Lynch will randomly incoherently ramble and shout throughout the game, and the subtitles won't cover it despite everything else. So you might think he's still the incredibly unbalanced psychotic man from the last game, however this time he seemingly got himself a girlfriend. We see her for maybe one scene before we learn her true purpose, to get raped and murdered off screen. This girlfriend character was already completely unbelievable enough but now I have to believe that Lynch cared about her. Lynch did not need an additional reason to murder people, that's literally all his character is, an incredibly violent, non empathetic man. Oh and how about Kayne? He doesn't really need to be there, he exists solely to remind you that the Jenny ending from the last game is canon as he whines about the fact that she still won't talk to him. Speaking of the endings and the story by the way it couldn’t be more garbage. K&L are in town for an arms deal but it goes wrong when, before the arms deal even takes place, they shoot someone’s girlfriend in a completely unrelated shootout. What happens after that is boring shootout after shootout where everyone from the people they were with to the arms dealer, the police, the military, then the gang all try to hunt them down and that’s what leads to this games woman in the fridge moment. SPOILERS After the girl’s death K&L decide that they can’t win this fight and flee, only to be caught and placed on helicopters, they then see the lead bad guy’s skyscrapper and decide to hijack the chopper and attack it, despite literally saying a moment ago there is no chance they will win. So they put a gun to the pilot’s head to fly along the side of the building while they shoot, and yet the other police choppers decide to try to ram you like they’re playing Battlefield. So I guess K&L literally found the most cowardly pilot in the force. After landing in the site they shoot their way to the final boss while the other police helicopters start shooting up the skyscraper. Oh so where is the boss? In a room that is completely shot up to pieces, completely by himself. He dies in a cutscene. I’m seriously getting angry just remembering this crap. The final mission has you hijacking a commercial plane where it just ends after you succeed. Oh and the cameraman gets left behind on the airstrip. END SPOILERS I could site the game's incredibly short length as a negative but I might have to say that it's the sole positive, that I was spared from an eternal torment. This should not be bought by anyone, it is a closet torture device meant to drive its viewer insane. At least they got through the whole game without making a single Chinese racial slur. Oh wait, the British villain does. Also when this game came out, some critics gave it a 9/10, others above a 5, they are both wrong."
Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days,Action,Pretty chilling game. Would be nice to see more games with a darker more serious tone with cool Asian aestheitcs and found footage style of camera. Also plays really well on steam deck 👌

NieR:Automata™,"Action, RPG",2D combat and old arcade style space shooter does not mix well with me. This is not the action rpg I was swindled into buying. Same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemies everywhere.
NieR:Automata™,"Action, RPG","I was stunned at how disappointed I was with this game. The combat is super repetitive (hold down RB! Spam X+Y!) Every character in the game is either an unsympathetic, stoic bore or completely over the top crazy.  The world is pretty but you play the entire game in the same relatively small area, constantly backtracking dozens of times. Don't get me started on Act 2, where you basically have to play the Act 1 all over again for minimal gain. The story developments are neat, but completely predictable. The RPG mechanic of having a fixed amount of memory that you swap in chipsets was really cool and well done. Soundtrack is phenomenal.  But all in all, the actual process of playing the game left a lot to be desired."
NieR:Automata™,"Action, RPG",this is a game where you have to get several ending to fully understand what it is about i like the story but unfortunately i didn't like any of the characters except pascal
Celeste,"Action, Adventure, Indie",simple but fun
Celeste,"Action, Adventure, Indie",harder than getting over it
Celeste,"Action, Adventure, Indie","Great game with solid gameplay feel and controls. This is one of the best case examples of an extremely well done difficult, but rewarding platformer (look up videos from GMTK on this for more). The music is incredible, the artwork fits, and the story is empowering and fun. The game does have a few negatives though. First, and most controversial, is the ""Accessibility"" options. I love it, but wish they disabled Achievements (or there was an Achievement for beating the game without ever using them). That's a very minor complaint though. Second, while some levels are incredibly well designed and good, a few were tweaked were made after release and have weird gaps and/or feel out of place. This is only a level or two though, so again not a big deal. Third, there are two levels that don't fit the mold and are just long and frustrating. The last screen on Chapter 7 C-Side and the last screen on Chapter 9. I understand that they are supposed to be some of the ""final"" levels, but it just feels odd compared to the rest of the game that these are incredibly challenging and super long, with some boring and easy stuff in the middle to make it artificially longer (looking at you Jelly Maze). Wish they had a more solid ""boss"" ending level that mixed things up more instead of just ""ultra long difficult level."" Finally, the game can get a little repetitive. There are only a few movement mechanisms that are added (Triple Dash / No Recharge Dash) with the environment being the main changing factor. Some of the ""hidden"" mechanisms that are revealed, such as Wave Dashing and Neutral Jumping and Wall Bouncing, feel a bit wonky at times too. Like they weren't intended but once found were incorporated into the gameplay despite being bugs. Besides those tiny things, the game is incredibly good and one I highly, highly recommend. 9/10"

The Ascent,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG","Cyberdiablo 2077 sort of. The graphics and gameplay is good but weapon / armor / skill variety is really shallow. The story isnt compelling or immersive by any means, the quests arent really meaningful either, playing with friends also doesnt make much sense since there are no classes you cant really support each other like RPG games, you just shoot together, do the same thing, revive each other etc... Wait for a discount then go for it."
The Ascent,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG",Very nice
The Ascent,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG","I really love the look of the game and the fact that the entire campaign is coop. The dark/gritty cyberpunk environments, graphics, lighting and music are fantastic.

My Friend Pedro,"Action, Indie","Fun, action shooter.  It was a little simple for the first quarter of the game and wasn't sure I liked it but as it kept going the difficulty and guns ramped up.  It was fun with unique levels interspersed.   Funny story.   I loved the intense final boss battles.   Really fun.   I'm glad I go this."
My Friend Pedro,"Action, Indie",perfect game
My Friend Pedro,"Action, Indie",I like My Friend Pedro. I feel like DeadToast are very capable in creating a game that is stylish and entertaining. When I wrote my curators review it was positive and I really wish their was a neutral review option because the first half of the game was really solid. Granted I never fully came to terms with all the controls and like the idiot I am decided to jump right into hard mode expecting a stylish gun ballet with Hotline Miami in mind. And I was wrong. Granted the hard mode probably makes enemies far more resilient to gun fire in some cases but half the time I felt like I was shooting a brick wall. Kicking gas tanks into a group of 4 people often then not led to only one person getting killed in the explosion. Melee strikes sometimes didn't register. And to top it off the gun splitting mechanic just confuses the hell out of me. I know my review is simply nit picking and I can own up to saying that I just suck at this game and I leaped into hard mode without a second thought but that's not even the worst part. I'm currently at a point in the game where it's mind numbing switch puzzles and platforming and I get that you need to mix things up in order to keep it fresh but all these puzzles kind of soured my experience a little. I love Devolver Digital and this game honestly kept me entertained in the first hour and a half but now I just feel bored and burnt out. I will complete the game obviously and maybe replay the game on normal mode just so I can try to get use to the controls a little better but as it stands I just don't know how to feel. I love the music the art direction with this semi cell shaded appearance but in the end I don't know what to feel.

Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood,Action,"Amazing game.  May not be pc anymore but the dialogue is superb along with the voice acting,  The game play, while not perfect, still holds up in my opinion.  I like to play this one every few years or so.   Game so good, I keep coming back."
Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood,Action,This game starts strong with confederacy. You get to shread union boys then sleep with the marshals daughter right at the start. Why cant we have games like this anymore?
Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood,Action,Call of juarez: Bound in Blood a great fps game although having a campaign of 6-7 hrs the game feels really awesome and you easily get attached with the character in the game. Well this game is also based on the wild-west  and it tells us the story of 3 brothers. This game teaches us that the path of peace and truth leads to a great and peaceful life rather than living the path of blood and lust.That's all this game is  really great l suggest all fps lover to play this game anyways before starting Red dead redemption 2 l thought l should get familiar with wild west and also with the life of a outlaw so l gave a shot to this game.And it really crossed the limit of my expectation.
Stray,"Adventure, Indie",I've Played it for 9 hours. Enjoyed it. I dont care if someone say its overpriced. Maybe it is? Cat is cute and realistic and I love it. The only thing a bit hit me was feeling its created for the youngest so npc around will never swear or something.. anyway need more meow now.
Stray,"Adventure, Indie","Amazing little game, loved everything about it. It definitely deserves a massively expanded sequel."
Stray,"Adventure, Indie",it's basically TitanFall 2 except that BT is called B12 and jack cooper is a yellow cat...

Alan Wake,"Action, Adventure","""you're wrong! i know now, without a doubt...kingdom hearts...is LIGHT!"" - best selling writer Alan Wake"
Alan Wake,"Action, Adventure","(Alone in the Dark + Twin Peaks + Max Payne) Alan Wake is basicly Deadly Premonition, But Good. Surprisingly effective survival horror game that is light on gore, heavy on scares and blends Psychological Horror with something more Lovecraftian. Graphics have aged incredibly well, apart from the facial animations and human models, which look plastic and barely move their lips in time to the voice lines. Maybe that will be fixed in the remaster. Alan Wake is a better Alone in The Dark game than the last one that Atari dropped around the same time. You fight enemies who are essentially resident evil zombies, but instead of being undead, they are living humans possessed by darkness and called ""The Taken"". To kill the Taken you have to use light to weaken them, then finish them off with a gun. Flares and flash bangs are very useful, as are environmental items like explosive barrels. Very Lynchian and meta. Lots of hidden TVs with an interesting Twilight Zone parody in most levels, like the original Max Payne. The voice of Max Payne himself appears in a little easter egg that hints towards where Remedy wanted to end that franchise. A must for horror game enthusiasts. Crime writer Alan Wake, suffering from writers block, arrives in the town of Bright Falls with his wife Alex for a vacation. But in the quiet mountain mining town, they soon find a nightmare instead. An ancient darkness looms over Bright Falls, one which blurs the line between fiction and reality. Wake finds the pages of a manuscript that he has never written. Worse still, the words on its pages begin to predict future events; Alex is kidnapped. An orgy of violence encompasses the town and Alan is hunted by the law and forced to go on the run. Can he find his wife and clear his name before the darkness ensnares him too?"
Alan Wake,"Action, Adventure",Its pretty dull.
Alan Wake,"Action, Adventure","The start of the need for a flashlight in spooky dark games craze. --what is it?-- A 3rd person story & adventure game with action, that reminds me of Alone in the dark. Your flashlight makes enemies weak at the knees."

Dead Rising 3 Apocalypse Edition,Action,"Yeah i hope you dont mind crashing often while also dealing with saves corruptions. Oh and the game is hardcapped at 30fps, there are many tutorials out there on how to increase it (dont go above 60 fps, otherwise menu's and aiming will break untill you set it back to 60)."

Project Warlock,"Action, Indie",what a thing of beauty
Project Warlock,"Action, Indie","I loved this game, the gameplay, levels, enemies and gore were fantastic. However, IT'S SO DAMN EASY. I played this on hard and so did my brother and both of us felt the same way. At first the game presents you with a decent challenge that makes it really fun and addicting, but after you start getting better weapons and upgrades the game gets REALLY EASY. I especially noticed this after the first episode and even then I never died except when I faced the first boss. Throughout the whole game I felt like I was just easily mowing through all the enemies with almost zero effort and the only time I ever felt somewhat challenged was at the bosses, aside from that I almost never died. Eventually the game felt so repetitive that I couldn't even bother with finishing the final episode even though I was halfway through it. It was just way too boring at that point. If the game would've been at least a little more difficult I would've happily given this game a positive review. My score: 6/10"
Project Warlock,"Action, Indie",Character upgrades in hidden rooms make me feel like I need to use a guide to play. Not fun.
Project Warlock,"Action, Indie","Hm, well the game is mostly 2d, much like wolf3d (oh irony), and this is reflected in the fact that space is use instead of jump. In fact, there is no jump button, just like wolf3d. And Doom. And Heretic. Etc. There are a handful of semi-3d bits here and there, where you take a lift to a higher or lower location, but for the most part the game plays entirely on 2 axes. It's also kinda buggy and causes ground flames to either fall through the floor or rise past the ceiling. The level design is labyrinthe just like wolf3d, but there's a lot more variety in the wall textures/decoration, so you won't get lost as easily. I still got lost several times tho. Weapons. This game has many of them. And they can all be turned into something better and more fun to play with. There's very minimal exploration to be had in this game so the shooting of the things in the face til they die is the bread and butter of this game. If you like mindlessly shooting things til they go BOOM or SPLAT or whatever, you'll probably like this game. Every episode is a totally different environment with completely different enemies. My personal favorite was the futuristic city with the soldiers and the robots and stuff. The medieval castle area was pretty cool too. Also there's the John Carpenter's The Thing inspired arctic-y area with yetis and lovecraftian eldritch abominations and whatnot. Also parka wearing motherfuc*ers that sometimes turn into weird fleshy blob monsters that violate you with tentacles that pop up from the ground. The bosses are kinda pathetically easy tbh. Or maybe I've just gotten really good at these since I've been playing a shi*ton of boomer shooters lately. But yeah no, the bosses are kinda on the easy side, they're mostly just bullet spongy. I would've preferred something with more actual challenge instead of just wearing down a massive health bar. Also the first boss seems kinda buggy. If you stand directly underneath him in his last form he just sits there doing nothing. But you also can't hit him back. Despite Dusk and Amid Evil feeling a lot more polished and generally much higher quality overall, I surprisingly had a lot more fun with this game. It's cause the weapons and shooting sh*t with those weapons is just so much fun and so go*damn satisfying. Also being able to upgrade those weapons to something EVEN BETTER. And level ups. And stat points. And perks."
Kingdom: Classic,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy","Damn, this game is so good"
Kingdom: Classic,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Good
The Age of Decadence,"Indie, RPG","great politics, combat and difficulty worth playing"
The Age of Decadence,"Indie, RPG","This game has several in-game messages saying that ""The combat in this game is stupidly hard"" as if that somehow excuses the stupidly hard combat.  Hard combat can be fun (ie dark souls) if your failures feel like your fault.  It is not fun when it is  random, unfair, and arbitrary.  This game is the latter."
The Vanishing of Ethan Carter,"Adventure, Indie","I really don't know where to begin, this game moved me the way only a few games in the past could do. It is a walking simulator / adventure game / horror-thriller movie with a detective novel essence. Incredible graphics, almost real life like, the soundtracks reminded me of the naive Miyazaki movies, a little sad deep inside, a little wondrous like a child. I played it like a tourist as well, took so many screen shots I almost felt like a Japanese tourist in Istanbul... And you would play this game even if it lasted 4 years to complete, it would be a hell of a journey... Buy it play it, digest it, remember it..."
Bright Memory,"Action, Adventure, Indie",Not worth it at this point

Dead Cells,"Action, Adventure, Indie","UPDATE: Have to give the game a ""NOT RECOMMENDED"" now. It has become extremely bloated and has so many power ups from unlockables that it becomes more about the grind than anything else. Yes, you can do well with skill, but rewarding people for just grinding over and over is something I hated in ""Rogue Legacy"" and was hoping they did away with in this... but they just kept adding more and more. Really, really wanted to like this... in Early Access I loved it. But they really focused on the worst elements instead of making it shine in my eyes. If you want a rogue-lite with a ton of persistent upgrades that give power then this might be good for you... but for any purists skip it. OLD REVIEW: ""Rogue Legacy"" done right. There are a few problems with the game and there definitely needs to be more variety. The biggest issue I have with the design is that they reward grinding to get bonus damage upgrades (similar to Rogue Legacy). That type of grinding kind of takes away from the Rogue-like aspect of the game. Outside of that the game is very good and feels great. Hopefully they add a lot more stuff, more variety in enemies, remove the grinding bonus damage part, and eventually add co-op. The game is definitely worth it right now, but with those changes this would be one of the best platformer rogue-likes out there. Can't wait to see what the devs do with it."
Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun,"Indie, Strategy",Noice
Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun,"Indie, Strategy","I think this game is what people LOOKING for exactly this game will want.  Painstaking, meticulous, crushing every mistake.  It rewards patience, thoughtfulness, attention to detail, and care.  I have absolutely none of those things.  But I""m going to give it a thumbs up, because the fact that it isn't right for me doesn't mean it won't be right for you."
Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun,"Indie, Strategy",Wonderful.
Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun,"Indie, Strategy","Good old Commandos/Desperados style game with a more user-friendly UI and game mechanics. It was really nostalgic for me, especially with the sniper and the “woman” characters’ usage . Story is a bit standard and predictable but dialogues aren’t so bad. And the voice acting was satisfying at Japanese voice over. Normally game isn’t so difficult but with challenges in game it takes a lot of your time and for completing all of them, you will have to play a mission twice or thrice. So, if you are a completionist or an achievement hunter it will be at least 40 hours of gameplay. Other than that, I did not encounter any bugs while playing but there were some crashes. I think I can say it has nothing new or surprising but it is a pretty good game at the same time."

The Wolf Among Us,"Action, Adventure, Casual",This game is Mind blowing. Everything in the game is perfect. 10/10 from me
The Wolf Among Us,"Action, Adventure, Casual",quiet good!
The Wolf Among Us,"Action, Adventure, Casual",clearly not a multiple choice game but the story is kinda good
The Wolf Among Us,"Action, Adventure, Casual",Good game. Play it
The Wolf Among Us,"Action, Adventure, Casual","It was one of the best adventure games I've evern played, I wish it was even longer and had more endings, but still Telltale games know how to make a good adventure game. And it gave me a lot to think, there is so much philosophy embedded in this game, it gets to you..."
The Wolf Among Us,"Action, Adventure, Casual","One of the best games I've ever played. It's a game about fables/tell tales by Telltale Games. While you try to control the notorious wolf who is the sheriff of this town, you investigate a murder case in the noir atmosphere. Gameplaywise it's a standard Telltale game but story and settingwise, it is spectacular. While you can do life and death choices, you will have to do minor choices all the time. However, there are some inconstancies about your minor choices sometimes at the previous episode summary parts. Originally the story is from comics and even I loved it (normally I hate mainstream comics). Details in this world (like Huff and Puff cigarette, Glass Shoes and etc.) and the characters were great. It feels like music and artstyle just try to keep up with it, nothing more. Naturally, for a game like this, to have a bug is pretty unlikely but it has a minor one at the end. Because I like to complete and see everything, I would love that the adventure parts end when I want it, like when I discovered everything in the scene or read everything; unfortunately for me it is trigger based and I missed couple scenes for that time. And fortunately, there are 30 replay points to discover or replay."
The Wolf Among Us,"Action, Adventure, Casual",best telltale game
DEATHLOOP,Action,"very nice singleplayer game with a touch of pvp, had some fun invading innocent players trolling them. its very nice to play the same 4 levels again and again on different timelines doing different stuff, unlocking codes and putting ideas together! i had no performance issues, although i dont like that you cannot pause this game nor save during a timeline, which means you loose all progress if the game crashes."
DEATHLOOP,Action,"hmmmm.... ""DEATHLOOPS"" favorite breakfast of the people of Blackreef."
DEATHLOOP,Action,"Deathloop is incredible, amazing, phenomenal, and one of the best compliments I can give to a game: ORIGINAL. This game OOZES originality from every pore, so much creativity, style, substance, the music, animations, dialogues, writing, characters, everything is absolutely on point. Colt and Julianna are great characters, their conversations are great to hear and does not feel like overexposure, gameplay is pretty much the same of Dishonored 2, but focused on guns instead of melee (you can slice and dice with a machete just fine tho). I just love it, don't get why so many people dislike it. Personally I had no technical issues with the game, besides a few FPS drops in open wide areas with enemies, but it was very playable. Is it Arkane Lyon's magnum opus? No, this still Dishonored or DMMM. But damn, this came close. Cool stuff!"
DEATHLOOP,Action,Great
DEATHLOOP,Action,"This game is essentially another dishonored game but reskined well enough to stand out. The Soundtrack for this game really killed it too. If you like jazz and dishonored, give this game a shot."
DEATHLOOP,Action,"A great immersive sim experience, but burdened by its requirement to make your own fun for a good experience. Played at 1440p + AMD FSR 1.0 to 4K, Digital Foundry optimized RT settings using an AMD RX 6800 XT, Ryzen 5900X and 32 GB RAM; also previously played to completion on PS5. ---------------------------------- Gameplay: 9/10 - Tight and responsive controls that benefit greatly from keyboard versatility and mouse precision. Story: 9/10 - Great atmosphere, twists and turns if you closely follow along text documents and audio logs. The voice performance for both Colt and Julianna are amazing and were a big part of the reason for how much I love this game. Graphics: 7 without RT, 8.5 with RT /10 - Looks a little plain without RT, but benefits greatly if your GPU can handle it. If you liked the Dishonored art style, you will most likely enjoy this game's. The addition of per-object motion blur helps sell the flair and style of Colt's movement. The HDR implementation is also great if you have a supporting display. Music and sound design: 9/10 - Gun sounds aren't anything special, but the world sound design and effects fit the atmosphere perfectly. The soundtrack sounds exactly like what I would've wanted in a game like this, and I immediately wanted to buy a vinyl of the soundtrack upon finishing the game; it is oozing with inspirations from 007, noir, and jazz. Replayability: 10/10 - If you enjoy making your own fun, learning level layouts and enemy positioning for challenge runs, this game executes it brilliantly. Once you're feeling satisfied with taking down the visionaries, you can take on the role of Julianna to ruin other players' days. ---------------------------------- DEATHLOOP is a great addition to the immersive sim genre, and fits in nicely as a must-play game for fans of Deus Ex, the Dishonored series, and Prey (especially if you liked Prey: Mooncrash). I originally finished this game and acquired all the achievements on PS5, and wanted to take on the mantle of Colt once again with the precision of mouse and keyboard, as the controller was just alright and not quite as responsive as I would've liked. With playing on PC, access to ray tracing and the upcoming AMD FSR 2.0 allows the game to truly shine at high framerates. Not quite a roguelike, DEATHLOOP proposes repeating the same day over and over again, acquiring new abilities and expanding your arsenal to take on the next loop, hopefully to break it. Though, you are not alone in your quest to break the loop: Julianna is out for your blood. All it takes is one perfect day; but, how long it takes for you to reach that day depends on your prowess and detective skills. Brilliant performances by Jason E. Kelley and Ozioma Akagha make up most of the voices you will hear in DEATHLOOP, preceding Colt's level entrances, and yet their narrative-developing banter is memorable up through the very end of the game. If you aren't someone who enjoys the ""perfection"" aspect of a game (like Hitman), DEATHLOOP may not be for you, and that's OK. While the levels do change based on your actions from earlier in the loop, their overall structure is largely the same. There have also been comments on the AI being a little too stupid (recent patches have made them smarter, but not too smart) and I would agree, though it did not affect my enjoyment of the game too much. Julianna invasions also can be annoying based on the loadout she spawns in with, but with some skill you are still able to elude her. If you find real players to possibly be a little too difficult, you can also play in offline mode to have an AI Julianna instead. Unraveling the story of DEATHLOOP and finding out how it connects to the greater Arkane universe was one of my favorite parts of the game. I really appreciate the developers making puzzle solutions unique to every player, so while you can look up how to solve a puzzle if you are stuck, you will not be spoonfed the numeric codes or symbols. Even with guides, solving puzzles is immensely satisfying, as well as running into side stories that can take upwards of a whole loop to solve on their own."
7 Days to Die,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation, Strategy",7 dana da umres
7 Days to Die,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation, Strategy","Not sure if I can call this game a product of development hell, I mean it would make sense since this game was in early access for 11 years, a span of time in which I went from being a punk ass teenager to a full fledged adult, and for the better part of that decade long development it's gone through numerous changes, going from an incredibly rough project to a refined survival experience that many would say was well worth the wait. It's not doing anything particularly new, being a project that was conceptualized at the height of YouTube's love for Minecraft and the media's now well worn love for zombies, it's DNA thrived because of these moment's in our historical love for let's play's and the undead but now 11 years later it can proudly stand on it's own two feet. There's nothing more rewarding than rebuilding a destroyed structure into a ram-shackled safe haven, fulfilling all our post-apocalyptic day dreams of surviving on our own or with friends. I would say it's maybe a little more casual than say Project Zomboid, but that's not really a bad thing, it's unique in it's right, giving your far more freedom than the aforementioned comparison. Definitely recommend."
7 Days to Die,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation, Strategy",guess this is as good as its gonna get. wish it had better combat. needed to have more action
7 Days to Die,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation, Strategy","The game does a good job of giving you the feeling of surviving a zombie apocalypse, starting from absolutely nothing, with complete freedom to do what you want. But every single piece of gameplay is so clunky and unsatisfying I cannot enjoy the game. Melee combat feels absolutely awful. Gathering resources and building anything is a massive pain in the ass. The quest system is terrible. Even something as simple as walking around indoors feels like a constant battle against the controls, trying not to get stuck on random objects or fall into some one-square hole you didn't notice."
7 Days to Die,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation, Strategy","So times have changed, We finally got 1.0 (as a beta) but as always the devs are still making progress at snail pace. Now every buildings within the game are built like dungeons with linear paths within wich takes away that feeling of scavenging and surviving an apocalypse. Its fun to run through the dungeons i'll admit but i liked the old alpha exploration better. Also what happened to the worlds zombie population? back in alpha 14 the cities were full of zombies wich made exploring buildings challenging as you often had to hop in a building and fortify it george romeo style and fend off the hordes (outside of the blood moon) --- 1.2 released, ever since the release of 1.0 the game lost that feeling of surviving in a zombie ravaged world. Now all its previous systems were ""reworked"" and turned into the most generic dungeon crawling horde survival based mess that lacks the original alpha's direction. Devs are clearly out of it and will go to great length to ignore player input, also backpedalling on many statements and being caught pulling off greedy b.s such as copy pasting this entire game to resell it as another product aimed exclusively at streamers (7days blood moon). I loved the game but honestly i knew that taking 10+ years to just push basic content meant the game was a dead end but seesh."
7 Days to Die,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation, Strategy",great game to play with a dad if you have one.
7 Days to Die,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation, Strategy",I died on the first day..
7 Days to Die,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation, Strategy","Coming from a long time player, this game through its various iterations has always been fun for survival role-playing with your buddies, exploring the random gen maps and it's solid base building and defending mechanics. I think the devs have hit a sweet spot with this latest update. PVP servers are ok, they do have cheaters and the game really isn't built around PVP balancing but that's not where this game shines, it really shines in its always amazing randomly generated maps and its increasing difficulty and various vehicles and goodies for patient players. this isn't just minecraft with zombies. its so much more, this game has made lasting friendships and memories, even from its earliest buggiest builds. but don't be dissuaded by that statement, its a solid game for solo players and mostly how i like to play it these days. i think you guys should add a perma-death toggle and go gold. once you've done that try and port it to consoles and add cross-play amongst some visual updates and bug fixes and i swear this game will be a solid staple for years to come, maybe decades if you keep refining mod support. also that new intro is sexy. give the devs some love people! its been a long road but they have been faithful and this game has earned its full price tag"

Atomic Heart,"Action, Adventure, RPG","I was incredibly bored by the opening bits of the game. I found the soviet thirst a bit weird, but only found out about the pro-Russian / anti-Ukrainian / FSB can have your data in the terms and conditions stuff later. If I had known the latter I would never have bought it to begin with, but it's not that that made me stop playing. Right off the bat it's clearly VERY inspired by Bioshock, and reminded me a lot of Infinite. Except with terrible voice acting, a world where everyone calls you Comrade, and clunky pacing. For reference, I liked the Bioshock and Wolfenstein games. I saw some of the reviews comparing this to those, which is mainly why I bought it. It does remind me of those, but not in a good way. It's like Wolfenstein, but unaware of its irony, and Bioshock, but without everything that makes it good. Just my opinion. If you don't mind the FSB having your data, playing a game that possibly funds the war in Ukraine, and playing a game inferior to all its inspiration, then go ahead. I'd rather just play Bioshock again, personally."
Atomic Heart,"Action, Adventure, RPG",people keep saying its like bioshock but its waaaaayyy more like dying light and theres nothing wrong with that cause dying light is an amazing game. this too is a great game

ISLANDERS,"Casual, Indie, Strategy","Such a fun positional puzzler.  No time limits, so you can take as long as you want placing each building to earn enough points to gain your next pack of buildings."
ISLANDERS,"Casual, Indie, Strategy",Smartest and most charming city builder/puzzle game ever. Quite unique and very well done. And very cheap too...
ISLANDERS,"Casual, Indie, Strategy","This is just not my game.  I could see why other people might enjoy it; its got some clever mechanics, its very good looking, the interface is well designed.  But I reached 8000 or so points in one game and realized that my basic issue with it is I just don't like casual puzzle games like this.  There is some meat there, but ultimately it seems like it is just the same thing over and over on each island, and as long as you move on shortly after you have filled up the island indicator, it feels like you could just keep playing endlessly.  I suppose that is probably a selling point for the target audience, but it isn't for me."
ISLANDERS,"Casual, Indie, Strategy",Super pretty game. Very calming and relaxing. The music is beautiful and really helps you relax. I can easily see myself playing this game for hundreds of hours and not getting tired of it. Hope for more content in the future! 9/10 Highly recommend!
ISLANDERS,"Casual, Indie, Strategy",Ok.....I might be a little addicted.
ISLANDERS,"Casual, Indie, Strategy","Lovely puzzle game. Pleasant art style, relaxing gameplay, presents you with many ways to approach your solution. After a few islands you'll start to see patterns. For me that made the game feel a bit formulaic and less enjoyable, but I imagine some people would find this satisfying. I still find myself playing it in short bursts though I'll probably set it aside before too much longer. I have greatly enjoyed my time playing it and I'm really glad I gave it a shot. The game might not have endless replay value for everyone, but I consider it absolutely worth full price."
ISLANDERS,"Casual, Indie, Strategy","Un des meilleurs filler qui existe probablement, sous couvert d'un city builder se cache un excellent jeu de puzzle dont vous ressortirez de chaque partie satisfait.e : Ses couleurs saturées, sa prise en main facile, son envie d'en refaire une alors qu'il est 4h, bref un must have du jeu à faire entre deux sessions."

BioShock® 2,Action,Very Good
BioShock® 2,Action,Bigdaddy pov of an entire underwater city!!! Adam is life delta. GG
BioShock® 2,Action,"Bioshock is one of my favorite games. I love the story and idea behind it, it has great elements in it. I prefer first game to second because of the story and depth of characters but it is still a great game and making the player a big daddy is a pretty good idea. And if you play before or after the book, you appreciate the game more. Multiplayer offers a lot of variety and it is not dead exactly. There are still some people playing as a group, not much but it is better than nothing."

Counter-Strike: Source,Action,yesss
Counter-Strike: Source,Action,"CS:GO is trash lets be real. CSS is the child that grew up to change the way we understand the FPS genre, CSGO is a pricy pay to play a game that feels free to play. Save yourself the school bullying, and be the bully. CSS is a real mans game. Not to mention the community is still active with some of the best servers and modes like Scoutknives. Best server communities: awpclan.com 63.251.20.212:27015 Dont disrespect the Counterstrike community and play csgo. Come to CSS #CSGOisaNo"

Crysis Remastered,Action,GOOD.
Crysis Remastered,Action,only get this if you own the original because you get 50% discount otherwise don't bother
Crysis Remastered,Action,"For people that have never played a Crysis game I'd play the remastered versions but for people who have played them, this isn't a worth while purchase. Basically no visual improvement in my opinion, Feels like they cranked up the saturation, added ray tracing to delete your FPS and then called it a day. Other than that perfectly fine game just not worth replaying at all even with the so called ""graphical enhancements""."
