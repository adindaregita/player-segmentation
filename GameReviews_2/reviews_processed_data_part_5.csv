76561197962437769,1,Armello,Recommended,"There's a lot to love here, but i'm just not compatible with it. Every time i reinstall and play this game (3 times in the last 2 weeks alone), i have a pretty good time until i run into another, new design decision that is so strange i lose all interest in continuing -- until i do again. So, it was a love-hate relationship until just today, and, well, there's always the straw that breaks the camels back, right? It's certainly not even a big deal, quite a small rule interpretation: When the lady bear attacks a corrupted creature, she uses her spirit stat instead of the attack stat. Fine, easy enough. But, then i would also expect, based on the generalized language, that when i have 2 corruption and then attack an enemy player with 6, shouldn't my spirit stat be used during combat instead of my attack? Fine, mistakes made. Live and learn, maybe? I've done that enough with this game, i think. More bad decisions off the top: - Can't speed up the first game played (after prologue) -- and this game needs it all the time. - Camera's auto-follow breaks after your turn, even if you didn't move it or put it into manual mode. - Speaking of the camera, two things: you can't zoom out very far at all -- certainly don't expect a board-level view -- and, to add insult to injury, a thick fog is wafted over the landscape at increasingly opaque amounts as you do zoom out, making for anything but the absolute closest zoom level blurry. - Certain rules are just plain barely/never explained. Looking at poison, the corruption stat, and exploding dice, among others. - Various other rule caveats that are not explained, which isn't always a terrible thing; however, making even small mistakes can often snowball your bad fortunes out of control. - On the bright/also-dark side, if you're winning, you'll feel like a million bucks. That's because there's a runaway-leader problem too. Multiple paths to victory doesn't mean all those paths are viable for any particular character, nor depending on a given point in the game. - Companions are vastly under-seen/available/used. (There's also a pull-your-hair-out, ""mischievous"" ""companion"" you might just get forced into having as well.) - Randomization is out of hand. I'm not talking about the dice. Dice are great, love the dice. I just don't like it in all of the other parts of the game. Which is everywhere. - Rewards and monetization of this game are questionable, in general. All of these things feel like idiocy, especially when many seem like quick fixes. They're painful to see and more painful to experience -- over and over again. There's a lot of good too, but the bad has overwhelmed it for me. I wish it was just a bit better. Or maybe i would have made the same review at 100 hours even if it was. Maybe it needs to be a lot better. It's hard to tell.",5.9 hrs on record																					(5.6 hrs at review time),N/A

76561197962437769,1,Racing Glider,Recommended,"The major problem as it stands is that the store page's minimum system requirements are simply a lie (or a hilariously terrible guess by the devs). I don't know how or with what alternate dimension CPUs and graphics cards they did their research with, but I would warn anyone that doesn't own a state-of-the-art system to take a big pass on this (granted, I can only guess that's what you'd need given my own system). As someone with a slightly older PC, this kind of thing is really starting to get to me. I completely understand that I can't run the newest games well or sometimes at all, but how am I suppose to know if I can or cannot if more and more devs are seemingly just randomly assigning a minimum rec without doing any research on how it actually runs on said systems. At best, this is unintended malpractice; at worst, it's straight up fraud. In regards to the rest of the game: My framerate's so low that I can't even comment much on the content of the game. Basically, it's lacking, but that's to be expected with EA, so I don't fault it for that. However, the severe lack of sound and performance settings is a bugaboo given the aforementioned problems. However, if you do decide to go ahead with a purchase, I strongly recommend buying on Steam so you have the option of refunding (I'm not so lucky).",0.2 hrs on record,N/A

The freemium model also works really well in this case. Even if you don't have the most viable deck for laddering, there's always multiple (fun) single player modes. Maybe things will change if I really started devoting myself to getting a high rank, but this is the kind of game I'm perfectly happy just messing about in.

[Update: 5 years later.] I own over 1,000 games on Steam, and this is probably my greatest disappointment. so much potential. Granted, i had a great time with what's there, but seriously, wtf happened? From the outside looking in, it seems like there are only ""idea guys"" that are in charge at this point; no actual, paid devs that can devote themselves to this. And for a game that apparently has between 200k and 500k sales (via SteamSpy) at around $10+ per pop (pretty sure i paid around $15 or maybe $20) -- and then transitioning to a volunteer group, no less? -- this is just a waste and should be a warning to any other devs who think they'll just come along and build ""the next big thing"" and keep adding pie-in-the-sky features without understanding the logistics required. There's just no coming back at this point, all good will has been lost -- like 5 years ago. To get $2+ million and still screw up this badly... wow.

76561197960269409,1,Manifold Garden,Recommended,"I'd recommend it mainly for the simple but breathtaking scenery. As a puzzler, it seems pretty daunting at first when it presents you with its infinite nature. Once you get a handle of that, the puzzles become disappointingly simple and it doesn't really keep pace with the promise it shows in the first couple levels when it gradually adds mechanics. Not saying the puzzles are bad, but it can't stand on the puzzles alone. Lucky then that it is an absolute technical marvel how it'll render your world repeating infinitely in all directions. It makes for some jaw dropping visuals. I took more screenshots in this than I have in any of the thousands of games in my library.",8.2 hrs on record,N/A
76561197960269409,1,GreedFall,Recommended,"Mixed review. Maybe a 7/10. 9/10 except for the quest design (see rant at end). A Spiders game in every way: developed by a small team but accomplishes a lot of what AAA devs strive for. Fantastic and unique setting (similar to Risen), great worldbuilding, story, characters, really fun and diverse combat + RPG options. There's a ton of impressive stuff here. BUT also is a Spiders game in terms of the negatives. It's a small team so they re-use assets. There are only a handful of building interiors, and since you'll be going into hundreds of buildings, you're going to see a lot of repeats. Environments are pretty, but are all pretty much some variation of forest (oh the delight when you encounter the occasional swamp.) The biggest negative here, and I cannot understate this: The quest design is absolutely ABYSMAL. Potentially the worst I've ever played. Quests have you nonstop running back and forth across the island for the most menial of reasons. This would be somewhat more bearable if you could quick travel anywhere, but you can't. You can only travel from designated spots to other designated spots, so approximately 80% of my time playing was spent just sprinting through woods. Again, I cannot understate how awful this is. There was one quest where you find someone illegally using slaves at a mine. Most games would just have you kill the slavers and be done with it. This one? Oh no. You have to run to an advisor (in another city, in the attic of the palace) who then tells you to look for the deed to the mine (in the basement on the complete opposite side. Why not just put it in his office? It doesn't even make sense!) That deed then leads to talking to the former governor (outside the palace) then to the mine owner (opposite end of the city) then back to the advisor (attic of the palace) and then back to the mine (other side of the island.) And you know what you do when you get back to the mine? Kill the @#%#^^ slavers like you should have been able to do immediately. And they are ALL like that. Maybe 20% of the quests have a quick travel option and man those quests are so much better. It's a shame because I really loved every other part of the game.",47.9 hrs on record,N/A
76561197960269409,1,Suzerain,Recommended,"I'm not a fan of visual novels in general, but this really provides you with a ton of opportunities to make choices, some with major implications (and some not... but you don't really know which is which sometimes.) There is a LOT of reading (cuz you know... visual novel) but if you're into politics, it's pretty fun. The best aspect is the sheer attention to detail and worldbuilding. You take over a country with a wide range of very real world problems (think like... Ukraine in 2020) with numerous other world powers all closely mirroring real world powers. Then it presents you with various other based-on-true-events issues and you have to carefully (or not) try to navigate your way through them.  Meanwhile, it's all fictionalized and integrated into the story in a fantastic way. My only issue with the game is it's pretty vague on the government budget. It gives you a -ton- of opportunities to spend money, but you never have like a ""tax day"" or anything to build the budget back up. Further more, it's not really clear on when costs/gains are coming. I ended up spending a ton of money to expand your education system, only to run out of money at the end and having to privatize the whole thing I just expanded.",20.1 hrs on record,N/A
76561197960269409,1,Othercide,Recommended,"If you're checking this game out, it's because of the super-stylized visuals. In that respect, the game nails it. Fantastic visual style, environments and music. It's really unique and does it very well. Gameplay-wise, though, the game gets super tedious. My biggest gripe is there are only 3 classes, each with ~3-6 skills (depending on your level) and the skills honestly don't really differentiate or even synergize. Lots of them break down to ""do a lot of damage in 1 hit"" vs ""do smaller damage in 3 hits"" vs ""do medium damage with a push effect"".  The environments are just a big flat square grid interspersed with barricades that don't even serve as cover in the X-Com sense. So you're usually just looking at all the enemy movements and then trying to remember where they are all going when you pick yours. It's dumb and tedious. Much like X-Com, the game can heavily punish you if you make a mistake. But unlike X-Com, it doesn't really give you the tools to do anything about it. I guess it kind of fits the brutal stylings of the game visuals, but it makes for a lame gameplay experience. The perfect encapsulation of the game is this: Your character health does not regenerate after missions. You need to sacrifice another character of equal or greater level in order to heal a wounded one. It's a very unique mechanic that fits great into the vibe of the game. But as far as how it actually plays gameplay-wise? It's awful. You're essentially wasting the time you spent on one character so you can sacrifice them to heal another.",12.7 hrs on record,N/A
76561197960269409,1,Midnight Protocol,Recommended,"Really neat ""hacking"" game - or more accurately - a cyberpunk-themed puzzle game. It's not quite at the level of the alltime classic, Uplink, but it's really really good. You purchase and equip various programs and hardware add ons, then use them to complete a wide variety of missions. The missions themselves have numerous options that are integrated organically into what you can do. For example, you might be investigating someone's home network and stumble across their bank savings, and you'll have different outcomes based on if you leave it untouched or not. There's an overarching plot as well as numerous side plotlines that come together in various ways. There can be a lot to keep track of and the plot itself has a few really complicated (but cool!) moments. Only gripe I had is that while there are a ton of various program/hardware options, once you figure out a configuration that works well, it's pretty easy to just use that for everything. There are only a couple missions that really force you to use different configurations.",25.4 hrs on record,N/A
76561197960269409,1,HUMANKIND™,Recommended,"Extremely similar to Civ 6, which is too bad, since Civ 6 is the worst civ in a while. Suffers from similar pacing issues with production vs tech (too fast!) so you end up just spamming districts and buildings all game. Combat is awful so you don't really like using units anyway. Navigating the terrain is a pain because it likes to generate cliffs everywhere. They do some neat things where you sort of cobble together your Civ bonuses as you go, instead of just picking one at the start. But it's a weird to think of yourself as Egyptian-Hungarian-French-Australians. They also implement some pretty heavy restrictions on the # of cities you can make. The map is split into regions and allows only one city per region (though you will absorb regions into preexisting cities, and then can build new districts in the new region so it's just kind of tediously complicated) The other major issue I had was the tonality of the narration. It's both trying to paint this grand picture while also being -extremely- sarcastic/funny. It just tonally doesn't match this style of game and comes off childish. I like amplitude games in general, but this is one is a hard miss. I'd highly recommend playing Endless Legend instead of this (and also instead of Civ 6.) Otherwise go to Civ 5, since all the latest offering in the genre have been lacking.",13.5 hrs on record,N/A
76561197960269409,1,IXION,Recommended,"A grim survival city builder, in the same vein as Frostpunk. Not as good, but it'll scratch the same itch. The difficulty options they added are nice; you can customize your game if something in particular is annoying you. The sci-fi theme is handled really well with a believable setting and lots of fun encounters (you send science teams around and have to make decisions in various Star Trek-esque scenarios.) Graphics are really good, though the cinematics were stylistically inconsistent. Biggest issue with the game is that the balance and pacing are a little funky. The beginning is punishing (while also very fun), but it encourages you to go reallllllllly slow to build up passive tech research and work towards self-sufficiency. Then once you reach the point where you are self-sufficient, everything becomes pretty trivial. Later stages were bursting with resources (more than the start) so that entire process seems wasted.",31.6 hrs on record,N/A
76561197960269409,1,Phoenix Point,Recommended,"Ridiculously similar to XCom, but flawed in a lot of ways. It's start pretty well, but man, does it get repetitive. The 'open world' battles are nonstop but each one just takes so long. You can't play reckless or else the game punishes you hard, which means handling everything slowly+cautiously. The fights are split between 4-5 different types, which keeps it fresh at first, but by the time you reach end game and everyone is fighting everyone, it just becomes such a grind. Enemies scale stronger than you do (even once you have everything unlocked.) I'm quite close to beating the game, but just can't stand it. it does not respect your time AT ALL.",49.8 hrs on record,N/A
76561197960269409,1,Wasteland 3,Recommended,"Fun, off-beat tactical RPG in the vein of Fallout 2 or X-Com. The combat is the game's main strength: it's versatile, well-balanced, and leverages your skills in fun ways. There are multiple solutions to approach most situations. There are often non-combat solutions, or, at least, ways to creatively make fights easier. The writing takes a big step back from Wasteland 2, but it's still ok. The game doesn't take itself too seriously (a good thing) and the factions are a mix of serious (refugees! The wealthy!) vs completely goofy (a cult of Ronald Reagan worshippers!) Wasteland 3 is generally at its best when it goes off the rails, but there are long stretches of less creative writing. Combat is better than Wasteland 2, but I preferred 2's writing. Speaking of which, the game references the other Wasteland games pretty heavily. It can be played on it's own, but random characters from previous games will show up and play pretty major roles.",32.3 hrs on record,N/A
76561197960269409,1,DAVE THE DIVER,Recommended,"Dave the Diver isn't a bad game. It's not really a good game either. It's certainly not a 97% great game like the reviews make it out to be. It starts out pretty great. You swim around. Collect fish. It's nice. Then they add a sushi restaurant which you manage. It's a pretty sizeable addition to what you are doing. Ok, cool. Then they add upgrade systems. Ok, now we're RPGing. Then they add upgrade systems on top of other upgrade systems. uhh.... Then they add night fishing. Then they add VIP visitors. Then they add photos. And pokemon cards. And fish hatcheries. And farms. And KPop dance minigames. And fish parties. It gets to be a lot. The issue is that the systems don't play super well with each other . It's so haphazard; it's like the devs had a game jam and tried to cram all the ideas into one product. What started as a peaceful, pretty fishing game becomes this Frankenstein mess of systems that you're juggling all over the place. Just navigating between all the zones trying to do cram everything into a day becomes tedious.",24.6 hrs on record,N/A
76561197960269409,2,In Other Waters,Recommended,"Gameplay-wise, it's basically a visual novel. You just wander around, following vague directions, and reading a text description of wherever you're at. Not really any decisions at all. Graphically, it's pretty neat what can be done with the minimalistic interface and text. But it's more of a neat experiment than it is a game.",10.7 hrs on record,N/A
76561197960269409,2,Wanderer,Recommended,"I don't want to get too hot take-y here but...... this is the best VR game I've ever played. At least as far as narrative-driven ones go. Even better than Alyx. At it's core, it's a puzzle solving adventure game, but with a lot of care taken so the puzzles are great for VR. The premise is fantastic: you start in an apocalyptic future caused by someone travelling to pivotal moments in time and altering events.  So you have to travel behind them and set things right. (Think Quantum Leap for all you 80s people.) The narrative sounds fine for a game but for VR... it's so fantastic to suddenly appear in historically significant events and live that out. Such an awesome VR premise. There are 5 primary moments, as well as 2 main ""home base"" settings, all of which are beautifully rendered in Unreal. It's triple A quality. Most of the puzzles involve using items from one era or another in another era, so you're bouncing back and forth using hi-tech solutions to low tech problems... or vice versa. It has a generous hint system if you want it, but everything is very intuitive.

76561197960269409,2,Wildermyth,Recommended,"This game touts its procedurally generated storytelling as its main feature, but the stories are lifeless and very repetitive. You can end up with odd mutations like a flaming arm or a plant growing out of your head, but all the following stories just completely ignore those. Like, it's the defining feature of the character, but the procedural generation instead just sticks them into generic run-of-the-mill encounters that you've seen previously. Not one person stops and says ""Hey! Your head is on fire! That's crazy!"" instead going on about how there's some commotion at an inn or whatever. Combat is... fine. It's all pretty standard move+action stuff. The warrior+archer characters are uninspired. Magic class relies on environment interaction, which is pretty neat.

The enemy encounters suffer similarly: sometimes the enemy rolls perfectly and blows you out, ending your run or sometimes they flounder about and you end up not needing any of the health items on the map.

76561197960269409,2,Pathfinder: Kingmaker — Enhanced Plus Edition,Recommended,"Kingmaker is a very long and uneven experience. It's got a fair share of good to it: the RPG mechanics and character creation are top notch. There are tons of classes, subclasses and multiclasses to utilize. Graphics are colorful and generally interesting. About halfway through, the game really starts to drag. There are kingdom management aspects which, while sometimes are fun, you're usually just juggling problems. Ultimately, they don't really benefit you and it's really just tedium for the sake of complexity. The combat is incredibly uneven. It starts pretty fun, but the fights quickly start ranging from complete one sided slaughters to unfair encounters that require save/loading. Tons of enemies using ability+level drains. Tons of traps everywhere. Boss fights that have invisible units just spawn on top of your casters. The game does offer a lot of nice difficulty options for tuning it to your desired level, but if you tune down the difficulty then the easy fights become even more pointless. That's where its uneven nature is the biggest problem, moreso than the difficulty itself. The plot is average. It makes you sort of feel like a pawn and not in control of anything, which doesn't really help the kingdom tedium side of things. The evil final character is nuanced and interesting and not some cackling maniacal necromancer BS. Your companion's voice acting is pretty good, with a couple exceptions (I soooo wanted to kill off the mopey dwarf except he was my party's healer.) Your party characters are largely stereotypical and forgettable. They start with initial classes/ability scores, which sort of sucks that you can't customize them more from the get go, since the character creation is definitely the strongest part of the game. Of my 80 hours in it, I'd say 30 were fun and 50 were tedious.

The world is pretty but you play the entire game in the same relatively small area, constantly backtracking dozens of times. Don't get me started on Act 2, where you basically have to play the Act 1 all over again for minimal gain. The story developments are neat, but completely predictable.

If you're playing this, and you should, it's for the enchanting scenery, great soundtrack (switching between prog rock battles and interactive violin/guitar dream sequences,) and unique mechanics.  You use your violin to basically cast spells and interact with your environment (or protect yourself from bad dudes.)

Sure, you unlock more stuff, but all your stats and equipment are just X% increase to your damage.  Playing the skills off each other is great, but you unlock most of the ones you'll use repeatedly pretty early. You end up with so much gold it's basically worthless, which, by extension, renders half your non-combat skills worthless (thievery, bartering, telekinesis, lucky charm to an extent.)  The characters and story are good.  There are many unique ways to interact with story elements (eating limbs, talking to animals, unlocking cabinets) but that just means that if you're a completionist, you'll encounter the same quest prompts over and over.  So you'll think ""Ah ha! Finally time to put that skill to use!"" only to just repeating the quest directions again.  So, yeah, repetitive and demoralizing.  The plot progression is just spread so thinly over so many hours of gameplay, it just isn't rewarding.  Graphics are ... fine, but the camera maximum range is zoomed in frustratingly close.

76561197960269409,4,Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales,Recommended,"Thronebreaker is a very creative take on the Witcher's Gwent mini-game, wrapped in a superbly written and voiced single player campaign.   The ""battles"" all take place in card form, and the game is very clever on presenting unique scenarios to change each fight.  Some of the encounters are puzzles: you use a pre-built deck versus a pre-built scenario.  Most however use a deck that you can add/remove cards from.  Outside of the battles, you'll have to make many nuanced decisions as a leader and ruler that often have consequences to the plot and your 'army' (deck of cards.) The game itself is very enjoyable, and I'd recommend it.  There are, however, a few issues which should be mentioned: First, it's far too long.  Even on the highest difficulty, you'll probably have assembled a pretty unstoppable deck about halfway through.  After that point, the battles can all be dealt with using the same strategy, so they get very repetitious, even with the various 'scenarios' that make them vary. Second, and this is related to above, but there isn't a ton of motivation for tinkering with your deck.  You can't save different configurations, so trying a new one means scrapping the old.  None of the scenarios really punished my deck strategy either, so at no point did it force me to change it up.  This all plays into the issue of repetition. Essentially, this game is super fun and well put together, but could really afford to be shorter or more difficult.  Even with the gameplay slogging along in the 2nd half, though, the plot, decision-making and voice acting really carry it the rest of the way.",40.4 hrs on record,N/A

Controls are tight and the enemy types are varied enough that you develop a different plan of attack for each.

The first 2/3rds is a lot of open-world questing through a beautiful and vibrant setting... but there's so little variety in the quests, you'll get sick of them and push forward through the story.  The main storyline is an erratic, nonsensical collection of JRPG tropes with overly dramatic dialogue and inconsistent character behavior.  Once you finish the open-world portion, the final 1/3rd of the game is a tedious slog on rails, no decisions, going from point A to B to C all the way to Z.  The combat is fast paced, dynamic, and generally feels good, but most of the fights feel the same and you'll be encountering similar enemies throughout the course of the game.

My biggest gripe is that the ship upgrades - which should be the most exciting form of progression - are just buried with piles of junk.  Rare equipment is simply a fixed percentage better.  Ship encumberance is now a thing, so you'll be desperately trying to trade off your neverending supply of worthless equipment.  You can't do nearly as much experimentation, since you have to find individual pieces that complement each other.  It turns progression into a boring slog.  The actual ship construction is really neat in placing all the individual pieces.  It's just a shame that part acquisition isn't better. The plot is fine, though, again, the first SPAZ was superior.  The character dialogue is completely obnoxious and you'll likely end up skipping it as much as possible. The gameplay is decent, which is its saving grace.  But honestly, get the first SPAZ.

76561197960269409,4,Subnautica,Recommended,"Absolutely superb game.  Single game play of ~30 hrs. Pros: The continual sense of discovey is unrivaled.  It generally is unguided, and when you explore independently, you'll usually find something cool.  It manages to interweave a plot into all of this, which is very hard to do in such a non-linear environment. Beautiful and terrifying world. Upgrades that give you a rewarding sense of progression. Good story and meshes well with everything you're exploring. Cons: Really wish you could start over with everything in new locations, though the fixed map is pretty much necessary for how tightly designed it is.  Really just wish I could experience it fresh all over. Inventory management can get pretty tiresome. Definitely some issues suddenly falling through the walls of your ship.  Had one instance where I fell straight 1km through the ground. VR Notes: I played through about half in VR, half out.  The beginning of the game (swimming around) is great for VR and handled aliright on a GTX 1080.  Controlling vehicles wasn't very pleasant for my stomach because of the stick-based turning.  Interacting with some UI elements can be difficult and sometimes impossible (ie naming beacons).  As the game progresses to vehicle control/base building, VR is more annoying than fun.

Technomancer is a game that tries really hard, and it has a lot of cool aspects, but tends to be rough along the edges.  It feels like an AAA rpg on a budget.  It reminds me of a cross between KOTOR (believable characters, good character development, great setting) and Dragon Age 2 (repetitive combat and level design.)  The first 5 hours is tremendously enjoyable, but the game is really hamstrung by having a very limited number of enemies and maps.  As the game goes on, you'll have to continually backtrack to complete quests; you'll return to the initial areas well over a dozen times.  Enemies respawn, which mean you'll have to kill the same ones each time you return as well. It's a fun game and you feel like you're making an impact on the events and world.

Has a neat asynchronous multiplayer ladder competition to encourage your base building. Base building is fun, has a ton of options, a gigantic research tree, and is like a billion times better than Fallout 4. Meh: The plot is an absurd fever dream that is constantly one-upping itself.  ""Oh, that thing -X- that can destroy the world?  That's all actually a distraction for thing -Y- that can destroy the world even harder!!!!""  Honestly, it just becomes kind of hilarious.

76561197960269409,5,Wasteland 2: Director's Cut,Recommended,"(Review for Director's Cut version - single playthrough ~50 hours) Pros: The writing is absolutely phenomenal.  The overarching plot isn't really anything special, but the major locations you go to are very creative and inspired.  Comparable to or even surpassing FO2 or New Vegas.  Some of the best writing I've seen in years, to be honest.  And there is a lot of it. The setting is cool, if unoriginal, and it's pretty open ended. You level up a ton, so there's a pretty constant feeling of progression. There's lots of hidden stuff and easter eggs and generally clever references. Mediocre: Combat is ok.  It starts to get repetitive, just due to the lack of options, and you approach every fight pretty much the same way. The character generation and progression is pretty bland.  It's pretty much entirely just increasing your % chance for good stuff to happen (combat hit, crit chance, unlock door, disarm trap, etc.)  Perks are cool, but none of them feel gamechanging or worth building a character around, like they would in FO2. You'll be using some skills ALL THE TIME, and nearly all of them simply result in you getting more money/ammo.  By the end of the game, you will be drowning in them, and there's really nothing that comes along that makes it worthwhile.  BUT, every once in a while, you'll find a quest item or somesuch, so you never feel like it's safe to just skip all the locked chests. Cons: Your party is just a bunch of random dudes which you create, with no personal storyline. You determine your characteristics right away, but then you encounter additional party members pretty soon who can overlap with your own skills, meaning you just wasted all those skill points.  Pretty frustrating unless you play from a guide and know that is coming. There's a lot of borderline worthless skills, except for a couple instances where they are super critical for quests.

The characters and equipment have a fair number of differences, so mixing and matching is pretty fun.

Yeah, the difficulty scaling gets a little off toward the end, but you no longer feel like you're just grinding endlessly.  I'm changing the recommendation from No to Yes.  Props to the devs for addressing everyone's complaints. -------------------- Previous negative review (from early build) : This game is supremely disappointing.  It does a lot of fun Sims-esque things: manage your life, meet whacky characters, work a side job for money....  And ends up being completely unhinged by the poor management mechanics.  You lose a percentage of your progress to your skills constantly, which results in major diminishing returns to progress - or even worse - regression.  The problem is that the opponents don't deal with that, so as the difficult ramps up, you need to grind exponentially more for the change to defeat them.  What a giant waste of time.",14.4 hrs on record																					(13.9 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197960269409,6,Human Resource Machine,Recommended,"It's charming and cutesy, but ultimately lacking.  I would really recommend checking out TIS-100 first; the gameplay is extremely comparable, but TIS adds a few additional levels of complexity above what HRM does.  HRM does have a potentially more interesting setting, but it ends right as you think things are heating up, leaving the plotline just as that: potential.",2.1 hrs on record																					(1.6 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197960269409,6,Lords of Xulima,Recommended,"This is a remarkably polished indie RPG.  It does a lot of really unique ideas and generally hits more than it misses. The most noticeable aspect is its open world, with no difficulty scaling.  The game teaches you right away (literally the first encounter) that fighting everything you see immediately can kill you.  Your characters' strength scales quickly though, and you'll frequently go back and crush the things which previously required a lot of Save/Load failures.  It's quite satisfying, but frustrating when you find yourself in an area you're not supposed to be yet. The RPG system is unique and well designed.  It has your usual characters (fighter/rogue/mage/cleric), along with some really unique ones (divine summoner.)  You can use excess money to improve your skills, and min-maxers will really enjoy how the system works. Graphically, the world is really vibrant and varied.  Which is good, because the game is LONG, and you'll be staring at it for a while. The combat can get a bit old by the end.  You definitely are encouraged to specialize, which means you're usually using a lot of the same skills and abilities for the entire game.  The difficulty keeps things tense, but encounters can become tiresome. The mod tools are very intuitive and you can easily tweak things you are annoyed by.  (such as the random encounter rate or the skill distribution on a pre-generated character.)",65.3 hrs on record																					(63.5 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197960269409,6,Life is Strange - Episode 1,Recommended,"Walking Dead Season 1 revolutionized the story-based adventure game genre, and Life is Strange is the best to be released since.  You are given many major and minor choices, more than those in the typical Telltale formula.  The minor choices often coming into play as well, but often in more subtle ways.  It is emotionally strong throughout, and you definitely form a bond with the characters - and not just the main protagonists.",20.6 hrs on record																					(15.5 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197960269409,6,Risen 3 - Titan Lords,Recommended,"If you're a fan of the Risen games, this iteration won't dissappoint.  The character levelling/RPG elements are unique and as entertaining as always.  The writing and voice acting are extremely rough.  If you're a fan of exploration, there are hundreds of secret nooks and crannies if you're willing to spend the time to look around.  Unlike the previous games, the melee combat in this one is actually enjoyable. The game does one particularly interesting thing - it opens up pretty much the entire world to you immediately, and the enemies do not scale with your level.  This has advantages and disadvantages.  The beginning of the game is quite hard, but as your character develops, you really feel yourself becoming powerful.  It's very satisfying.  However, by the end of the game, you feel like an unstoppable god and just plow through the same enemies that you've been fighting for the last 30 hours.",27.5 hrs on record																					(25.0 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197960269409,6,Ephemerid: A Musical Adventure,Recommended,"First off, it has a stupendous soundtrack.  If you're into rock opera at all, you'll like it. If not, if you're into indie games with a strong emotional thread, you'll like it. Game-wise, honestly, it's nothing mindblowing.  You click on stuff.  Usually to the beat of the music.  Sometimes you click and drag.  It's not exactly Mass Effect.  But it blurs the lines between Game and Art, and if you're into that, you'll like it.",7.5 hrs on record																					(5.4 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197960269409,7,Ring Runner: Flight of the Sages,Recommended,"Really enjoyable top-down space shooter.

Lots of irreverant humor, especially references to pretty much all popular sci-fi.",13.9 hrs on record,N/A
76561197960269409,7,Card City Nights,Recommended,"Card City Nights is a lighthearted and simple card game.  It reminds me a bit of the Final Fantasy 8 card mini-game.  You and your opponent place cards on a 3x3 grid.  You link your cards together via connecting arrows and, depending on the card effects and icons, can either attack your opponent''s health, disable their cards, increase your own health, or revive your own cards (for the most part.)  You build your own card deck and unlock new cards as you go.  The AI is pretty mediocre.  It's enjoyable enough, but really would need another couple game mechanics and a better AI to really shine. (Minor spoiler) The biggest negative I have against the game comes at the very end - the final boss is deliberately unfair.  They even say straight up that they don't have to follow the same rules as you do.  Just because the game's AI is ♥♥♥♥ doesn't mean that it's fair to balance it by straight up cheating.",12.3 hrs on record,N/A
76561197960269409,7,Blackguards,Recommended,"First: Blackguards isn't bad or good.  It's just extremely mediocre.  If you're into D&D alternatives and dig X-Com, it probably won't waste your time.  But I can't recommend it for most people. The character customization is surprisingly lacking, despite the illusion of choice.  There are twice as many attributes as a D&D system, but they all just sum together to increase your attack, dodge chance, initiative, etc.  There are only a handful of combat abilities to use, so there's not a lot of choice as far stabbing/shooting.  The magic users are more nuanced; there are a ton of spells, each with 4 tiers, so you're constantly weighing the cost/benefit of those. Combat itself is very similar to X-Com or D&D 4.0: you get either a move and an action, or a double move.  This all occurs on a hex-grid, and most maps have some sort of interactable element to spice it up.  They do an admirable attempt to differentiate the levels, but you will take place in about a billion combat scenarios, so a lot of them inevitably feel repetitive.  You'll probably be skipping side quests by the end out of boredom. The plot is pretty linear.  There are batches of side quests that open up at various points, but none of them augment the main plot line at all.  It's your typical RPG ""save my daughter"" or ""escort my caravan"" kind of stuff.  You become enslaved and forced to fight in a gladiatorial arena at one point, so that's pretty neat.",28.5 hrs on record																					(26.9 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197960269409,7,Epic Battle Fantasy 4,Recommended,"Very tight combat mechanics with a lot of interacting skills, status effects, and equipment.  The depth of customization here is stupendous.  It keeps the combat fresh and only becomes tedious near the end if you need to power-level your way up to handle the extremely formidable bosses.  Interesting characters, tons of loot, and the diverse combat mechanics keep the game engaging all the way to the end. Graphics are anime-style rendered in a flash engine.  Not exactly crysis, but it doesn't want to be, and it fits the feel of the game perfectly. The dialogue is humorous - adolescent and boob-focused, but again, this game doesn't care about that and neither should you.  It knows what it wants to be and does it great.",20.6 hrs on record																					(20.4 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197960269409,7,Salvation Prophecy,Recommended,"If I had to compare it to something, I'd say it's a lot like Mount & Blade in space.  You are usually running/flying around with a group of AI allies fighting another army of AI enemies.  The storyline is strange and pretty forgettable, but redeemed by the enjoyable gameplay.  Both the infantry and space pilot gameplay types work well.",11.3 hrs on record																					(9.9 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197960269409,7,Talisman: Digital Classic Edition,Recommended,"I really want to like this game, because board games rule, but wow the game this is based on is absolutely garbage.  This plays like monopoly with an RPG element.  It's ridiculously random - a ton of the locations give huge awards for rolling 4-6 and huge penalties for rolling 1-3.  Movement itself is largely based on rolls (unless you, again, are lucky and find a teleport spell/event) so you can't even move around with strategy.  You just go where it tells you, deal with whatever good/bad thing that happens, then wait for your next turn. Not only is the gameplay horrendous, but it's littered with reminders to purchase tons of overpriced DLC.  Base game for $1, DLC for $30?  No thanks.  Don't buy this.",5.9 hrs on record																					(4.8 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197960269409,7,Hack 'n' Slash,Recommended,"One of the most unique games you'll ever play.  The game slowly let's you modify more and more of itself, eventually graduating from editing simple variables to modifying function calls.  It's completely free-form, in that the solution can be whatever you code it to be.  You can delve in the code to find the solution to the puzzle, or edit the code so the puzzle doesn't trigger to begin with. If you mess up while modifying the games code, it even has fake blue screens.  And, if you're like me and REALLY mess up, you can even crash the game entirely, which adds a degree of legitimicacy to all the crazy stuff you can do.",5.0 hrs on record,N/A
76561197960269409,7,Sid Meier's Civilization®: Beyond Earth™,Recommended,"It tries to streamline Civ 5, but ends up simplifying it to the point of boredom.  The choices you make are so minor that every game feels the same.",19.5 hrs on record																					(19.1 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197960269409,7,Max Payne 3,Recommended,"In Max Payne 3, your primary objective is to move from point A to point B and kill everything in between.  Do not attempt to go to point C, because that door is closed and inaccessible until a cutscene opens it.  Do not attempt to sneak past someone without killing them, because killing them is required for the cutscene, as well.  So yes, you will be killing a lot of people.  Approximately the entire population of Brazil will die to your guns, all to trigger that next cutscene where Max Payne laments his terrible life and how he's sad.  Chin up, Max!  A new door opened with more people to kill!  Oh, but don't shoot them in the chest, because they are wearing T-Shirts, and Brazilian T-Shirts can negate 3 bullets from an assault rifle. The game isn't without its merits.  The trademark bullet-time allows you to play aggressively, without hiding behind cover like pretty much every other shooter made in the last decade.  The character models and animation are phenomenal, although the entire game takes place moving from one rusty corrider to another, so the same can't be said about the environs. Overall, it's a hideously boring game with extremely tired game mechanics.  It's a glorified tablet game - press button on bad dudes, watch them die, get a cutscene, repeat.  There are no exploration or choices.  Your decision making is strictly limited to ""Do you want to pick up this gun with 30 bullets or keep the one you have with 14?""",7.8 hrs on record																					(7.4 hrs at review time),N/A
