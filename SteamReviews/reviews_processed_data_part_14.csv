I wish we got to see the potential characters we will be able to play in the full version (something to look forward to), and that your gold didn't reset when you made it back to base (without dying). It also feels like a waste when you encounter an NPC shop early in your map when you have no gold because you can't return to them later - rather, they aren't there if you do return. Could just be the fault of randomly generated maps, though. Overall, it's a pretty decent game.",1.4 hrs on record,N/A

76561198352793022,1,N/A,Recommended,"I love all of the improvements, and I know there are more to come. It just keeps getting better. I like to binge play for a few days or weeks and then take a break. Whenever I return, the game is just a little bit better and I don't mind having to start over for the bigger improvements. It's just the right amount of challenging and relaxing. I will keep coming back to Going Medieval.",404.0 hrs on record																					(381.9 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198352793022,1,N/A,Recommended,"The tutorial doesn't explain enough, especially the scoring lines, but after a few rounds I managed to figure it out and had fun. It's definitely a BIG NUMBERS MAKE BRAIN HAPPY game, making you want to keep playing even though you're not doing much. Fun casual game that doesn't require a lot of skill, just decent luck and strategy.",5.4 hrs on record																					(2.8 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198352793022,1,N/A,Recommended,"Not quite Solitaire, but better than Balatro! I don't know if any of the future characters will require sequential card combos (as is standard in Solitaire), but the base game with the Wizard doesn't - and that's okay! I love the aesthetic and creative card effects (both negative and positive) that challenge the already challenging gameplay. It took me about 5 play throughs to fully understand the mechanic and features, but I kept wanting to try again; and that's key to making a challenging game FUN. Also, thank you for allowing the game speed to be adjusted. Once I found my flow, I turned it up to 2x speed and felt my dopamine spike seeing those combo modifiers applied faster. I played this demo over and over for 4 hours straight; and I could probably play it forever.",7.1 hrs on record																					(4.2 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198352793022,1,N/A,Recommended,"This game is challenging in the best way! Lots of ways to build your deck and strategize your combos to defeat enemies. New enemies are added with each map and each enemy has unique skills. It's very well balanced. There are secrets to discover and boons that enhance your gameplay in various ways. Plus, they are consistently improving the game since it's in Early Access at the time of me writing this. I would only ask that there is a setting to speed up the enemy animations since it is turn-based combat. The game seems to slow down on the enemy's turn, especially when it's just the counter ticking down.",24.0 hrs on record																					(18.3 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198352793022,1,N/A,Recommended,"This is such a fun demo! I love how easy the cards are to understand and the all around art style is gorgeous. The combat is familiar, allowing the combos to the major highlight. From discovering a new combo to the illumination of the icons as you build them,  it's a wonderful experience. This game is more than just a roguelike reskin.",0.7 hrs on record,N/A
76561198352793022,1,N/A,Recommended,"It's fun to play with friends or solo, though after the first few in-game years it feels repetitive. It's been nice to have updates that bring in a little variety to spice up the monotony a little.",528.1 hrs on record																					(495.9 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198352793022,1,N/A,Recommended,"The HoloCURE to Bullet Heaven boredom! I know NOTHING about the Holo Live Vtubers, but this game is incredibly fun even without the knowledge. It's a well-balanced game with no frills. The addition of the gatcha shop to unlock new girls is cheeky, but even better is the surprise of the Holo House. I had no idea what I was walking into when I unlocked the Holo House and it turned this really fun take on a trending game genre into a mind-blowing experience. I won't spoil it for you. If you can, go into it blind like I did. I'm sure it has some tie-in to the Holo Live scene too. TL;DR Super fun, well-balanced, and a nice surprise in the Holo House unlock.",16.7 hrs on record																					(2.2 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198352793022,1,N/A,Recommended,"It's fun and challenging! The description of some of the specialty dice is unclear, but it only takes a bit of fiddling to figure them out.",6.6 hrs on record,N/A
76561198352793022,2,N/A,Recommended,"Fun and addicting, thought the scoring animations slow down the gameplay a bit. I'm enjoying the challenge of building the best dice set to beat a level.",27.8 hrs on record																					(19.6 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198352793022,2,N/A,Recommended,"This is a fun, challenging game with an unexpectedly difficult boss fight. It balances the idle feeling of repeatedly mining through layers of gems and for upgrades with the delightful interactions with the gem girls. Definitely worth playing as a way to relax and have some simple fun.",3.2 hrs on record,N/A
76561198352793022,2,N/A,Recommended,"For a game with such simple mechanics, it's quite a fun and difficult challenge. It took several attempts for me to figure out the strategy for choosing cards to get me further and when to make sacrifices. I also love the storytelling in the sound design. Don't forget to turn up the voice. It really sets the tone for this game.",8.1 hrs on record																					(3.6 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198352793022,2,N/A,Recommended,"This game combines my love of turn-based strategy games and match-3/puzzle games. Even though it often seems like the board is set up to give the computer opponents match-4s, I still enjoy myself and my own match-4s and match-5s feel earned. I really enjoy playing this game and unlocking new rewards, stickers, etc each time.",15.3 hrs on record																					(5.0 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198352793022,2,N/A,Recommended,"Fabledom is a lot of fun and has great replayability. I love city sims but it can become boring after learning how to optimize play for the best outcome. Having several types of romance partners and/or warring enemies available, plus random encounters, it keeps me entertained all day long and looking forward to playing again.",19.3 hrs on record,N/A
76561198352793022,2,N/A,Recommended,"There is more to these men than meets the eye. This is sweet and romantic game that lets you decide whether you want just a casual relationship or dare to make a commitment. With multiple endings and a nice range of personalities among the men, this game makes you look beyond first impressions before you can get to whatever kind of relationship you're looking for. I enjoyed to getting to know each guy, and was pleasantly surprised to see that you will interact with some of the other guys no matter which one you choose to date. The only Con for me is that Tristan only has one pose and expression, while all of the other guys have varied poses and expressions. For this reason, I wasn't as engaged in Tristan's story. He always looked sad, even when things were going well and he should be laughing or smiling... Please give Tristan the same treatment you gave the others.",11.4 hrs on record																					(8.6 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198352793022,2,N/A,Recommended,Much more difficult than it seems and it keeps getting harder the more you succeed. I love a game that continues to challenge me in new ways.,81.2 hrs on record																					(74.0 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198352793022,2,N/A,Recommended,"The Beta was great, the Live Release is even better. So much customization, a good tutorial that doesn't take too long, support to remove annoying alerts (if desired), and more! I put in over 100 hours of play time during the Beta and am looking for to just as many in the Live Release.",307.1 hrs on record																					(191.3 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198352793022,2,N/A,Recommended,"This is a well written, engaging narrative with creative puzzles of various types. You can set the difficulty of the puzzles, and the hints aren't too heavy handed. I appreciate that the hidden object puzzles have some items that require assembly (very creative approach) and an alternative puzzle mode if it's too difficult. And there are a few types of achievements outside of Steam achievements that keep the game play engaging when stuck on a puzzle. I played on the medium difficulty and was challenged but never discouraged. 10/10",10.6 hrs on record,N/A
76561198352793022,2,N/A,Recommended,"So... the concept is cool and the art is beautiful but once you have more than 4 sheep it becomes a chore. They are constantly moving around you, which makes placing the correct one(s) in a specific spot difficult. This also causes the sheep to get caught in corners and ditches from which you can never retrieve them. The only way to fix it is to restart the level, which is torture when you're doing the puzzle levels. It's just not worth the effort after awhile.",3.1 hrs on record,N/A
76561198352793022,3,N/A,Recommended,"First of all, the sound track is phenomenal. I did my first play through while baking and it created such a relaxing atmosphere. And then you can buy a radio... <3 I just wish there were more stations to listen to. Second, the game play is really good, though repetitive. However, it's supposed to be as a game about death and taxes. The dialogue is very witty and each NPC has a distinct personality. There was a lot of thought put into the backstory which made me want to ask more questions from the NPCs. There is a lot of replayability built into the game, and multiple endings. I love the inherent challenge in just following orders vs doing whatever you want to do (whether that is ""good"" or not). Definitely worth playing all the way through at least once.",11.1 hrs on record																					(8.4 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198352793022,3,N/A,Recommended,"If you love to master trade skills and have a bit of combat every now and then, this is the game for you... and me. I could spend all day in the mines. I played for 17 hours in the first two days after buying this game. It's easily addictive, though you have to be able to take the initiative to do some trial and error for some things, like initially taking on tasks you don't know how to complete (and then missing the deadline because you have to find the materials, to build the tool, the do the thing). 9/10 Highly recommend",124.7 hrs on record																					(17.4 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198352793022,3,N/A,Recommended,"I first saw this game as a Stumpt Gamers let's play on Youtube and it looked so fun that I had to get it. Playing it myself, it's addicting and there is so much replayability! It's fun to try to get all of the silly Steam Achievements, like win a game butt naked, or to just try to get to gold status in any of the categories. I highly recommend it if you are a fan of silly, fun, board game-type PC games or just want to relax.",38.2 hrs on record																					(9.7 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198352793022,3,N/A,Recommended,"As a person who does not play PC games very often, I was confused that the only keyboard controls given in the settings were Interact, Jump, Crouch, and Push to Talk. I didn't know how to move at all, so the first few play throughs we couldn't get past the second room. I finally had to ask my partner, a gamer, how they were moving about, and they told me to use WASD. Those are NOT intuitive controls for movement. Directional arrows are. Other than that, this game is like a virtual escape room, which is fun - though the flooding and freezing effects really do a number on my anxiety. Still, I want to keep trying to escape. This game is definitely not for the easily frustrated and those who suffer from anxiety.",5.8 hrs on record																					(3.9 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198352793022,3,N/A,Recommended,"I watched Jesse Cox play this on his Youtube channel about a year ago, and I finally got around to giving it a try. I wish I hadn't waited so long. This game is a lot of fun and easy to play. It isn't like other card collecting games where you have to spend a lot of time managing your cards and leveling them up. It's very straight forward and the cards you collect just add to your general collection - or you can put them into guaranteed draw slots. I don't usually enjoy playing against others either, and never do it in the first few days of playing - but the game play vs computer is so similar to playing vs a live person that I am not deterred at all. Try Age of Rivals! You'll like it!",35.3 hrs on record																					(24.2 hrs at review time),N/A
