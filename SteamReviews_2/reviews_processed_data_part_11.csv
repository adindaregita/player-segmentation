76561199027285610,1,N/A,Recommended,"This is one of the most boring, uninteresting games I have ever played. If you are buying this game just for some fun zombie combat, don't. The controls are extremely clunky and the zombies take more of a backseat to the human enemies. The only fun part of this game is running away from the massive zombie hoards however I got about halfway through the main campaign and that only happened a handful of times. I will not be finishing this game and honestly wish I have never bought it. 4/10.",30.9 hrs on record																					(16.5 hrs at review time),N/A
76561199027285610,1,N/A,Recommended,"POSTAL Redux is a top down remake of the controversial shooter from 1997. It improves the AI, graphics and is overall a much better version of the original game. Gameplay is ok, nothing special. Click to shoot the bad man and run around to dodge bullets. Shooting could be a little better but theres nothing wrong with it. Graphics are also fine. Nothing huge but all the areas look nice but models could be a little more refined. Music and sounds is pretty good. Music is very disturbing and unsettling, fits the game very well. Sounds are pretty nice too but I think the weapons should sound a little more louder and pack a little bit more of a punch.

76561199027285610,1,N/A,Recommended,"Max Payne 3 is a cover based third person shooter. It has extremely satisfing shooting along with very nice visuals and soundtrack. The shooting in MP 3 is some of the best out there. Your crosshair is a single dot which means you have to be very precise with every bullet you shoot. The sounds the weapons make and the gore make all the weapons extremely pleasant to shoot. The games story is pretty good as well. I wont get too into because spoilers but as someone who did not play MP 1 or 2 it did a good job telling me what is happening. The only downside is a big one, you cannot skip the cutscenes, thus making replayability a lot less fun than it should be. The soundtrack is amazing, every song is banger after banger with a highlight being the airport level music (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMx1ILebEE) Max Payne 3: Gameplay: 9/10 Story: 7/10 Soundtrack: 9/10 Overall: 8.5/10",14.3 hrs on record																					(13.4 hrs at review time),N/A

76561199027285610,1,N/A,Recommended,"Rise of the Tomb Raider is alright. I personally don't think its anything special but it works and does everything it wants to do. Tbh I completely skipped the story, I watched the first cutscene and didnt watch any of the others lol (I wont count story in the final score) Visuals are great. Goes for a gritty realistic style and nails it. Looks beautiful even 6 years later. Gameplay is fun. Its a pretty standard third person shooter. You take cover and pop out every once in a while to kill enemies. The platforming is actually really fun. I wasnt expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. You are jumping from cliff edge to cliff edge, climbing rocks, grappling hooking on stuff, its all a lot of fun. The real fun comes from mixing combat with platforming. You'll be shooting an enemy on one side while grapple hooking over and shotgunning another enemy on the other side. Its a ton of fun.

76561199027285610,1,N/A,Recommended,"Pit people wonderfully creative turn based strategy with great music, great visuals and most importantly great gameplay. The writing is very funny and manged to make me laugh multiple times. The craziness of everything just goes right along with the writing. Gameplay is simple, you assemble your squad, choose where you would like them to go and they attack for you. At first I thought this would take away strategy but it actually adds quite a bit of strategy. You have to perfectly place your squad to attack the right enemies and do the right commands.

76561198025679656,1,N/A,Recommended,This was a really polished well-done game about an sad time in history.  I know a lot about the war itself during WWII but not a whole lot about what happened afterwords.  This game does a great job in informing about that time in history.   They add newspaper article headlines to paint a picture of what was going on in the world at the time as people were getting adjusted to post-war but rising tensions with the Soviets.   It was interesting to learn that not everyone wanted to continue with prosecuting war crimes as they wanted to move on and not be reminded about bringing up a tough time in history.   They just wanted to put it in the past.   The voice acting was superb.   The ending was great too!   I could tell a lot of work went into researching the cases.      These were interesting because the cases were about crimes that happened in the civilian sphere during the war instead of the actual battles themselves.   I never thought too much about that and they did a great job of illuminating what it was like to be a civilian during war.    Looting was punishable by death!  Crazy time.

They mercifully would block off areas and elements that were not longer needed to progress through the current puzzle.  This was nice so you didn't have to spend time back tracking if there was no reason to.   They did have a few boss battles that I wasn't a fan of.  Not because they weren't good but because I wasn't in the mood for it in such a wondrous calm world as they made.   Also, I was wanting just a puzzler.    The bosses were few and took a handful of tries but I beat them rather easily.    I will say, the boss battles were rather unique and I appreciated that part of it.   Not a deal breaker by any means but be aware there are some moments of tension.  The world was insect-like and at times was creepy and surreal.

It's fun and while not too educational as there is no dialog it does have a short bonus area that discusses some space science.   It has three art pieces that are around 10-15 minutes long each.   I enjoyed it a lot and had fun.",0.7 hrs on record,N/A

76561198025679656,2,N/A,Recommended,"This was kind of a running simulator but my goodness the level designs were perfect.   First off, I appreciate them not putting things to find as many games do now days to encourage exploration (and possibly time padding).  It helped keep the flow of the game focused  and I really appreciated that.   It made it way more immersive and enjoyable. I really give them props for having the flow of the player instinctively laid out.   No wondering where to go.   The direction of where to go was laid out perfectly.    May not be for some people as not a challenging game.     It wasn't really scary either as I never was scared of dying that much.   However, it didn't take away from the experience and I really enjoyed it.   The oil rig setting was really cool and I wondered how much it looked like in to an actual one in real life.

The fight sequences were realistic and the fight choreography was varied making each fight weighty.    Honestly, it did get repetitive on the amount of them you fought after awhile.   This was more of a movie where the story is going to be told and you are along for the right.  I was willing to relax and let it take me on its journey and I loved it.

It is stealthy type of game and there are areas were you have to play over and over until you get it right.   The longer you go into the game the more upgrades you can do to help yourself.   There were a couple of levels were you traverse an area without enemies that you have to solve an area.  I give it a 7.5/10.   I would recommend if you like stealthy games and vampires.

I had played a little before but didn't have my VR legs, and the scenery and tools looked a little bland.   Decided to give it another go as I always planned to come back and I was blown away how good this game is.   The puzzles are portal-esque I guess to give some sort of idea but definitely different.   A lot of the puzzles were real brain-busters.   Many I spent half hour one figuring it out.  Some I had to sleep on and come back to.   Many times I thought the puzzles were impossible and/or must have had a bug where the game didn't give me enough lasers or cubes or other tools.  But eventually they all were deemed solvable on their own and I really appreciated the level designers for coming up with such amazing puzzles.  Kudos to them.  And the fact that this is not just puzzles but has a real existential almost quasi-religious take made it so I wanted to finish the game even though I was puzzled out.   Definitely a 10/10 game.

76561198025679656,3,N/A,Recommended,"Index with Knuckles I thought I would like this game and did for about 75% of the way through.   Then the whole experience derailed into an annoying tedious janky rest of the way.   The more I played this the more I feel this is analogous to a point and click adventure set in a VR package.   I like point and click adventures but they can also get old .   I found myself just wanting this to be done with.    The controls are pretty janky which isn't unique to VR games that I have experienced.   Trying to pick up this when you wanted to pick up that.....but the developers didn't design the things and devices with VR in mind.   Things were too close together a lot of times for puzzles or had awkward hand placement and unresponsive movement.   On top of this, some of the puzzles were timed based.   This all added to a frustrating experiences that overwhelmed any potential fun I was having.    The puzzles were sometimes obtuse and the fact that manipulating puzzles was hard, it just made it more irritating than enjoyable.   This was an inventory nightmare and I'm glad I read that you should keep everything in one place; otherwise you will forget where you put things and have a hard time finding it.     The story itself was blah, as it didn't go into the plot very much except once or twice during the 10 hour experience other than the last part - and the ending was meh.  Not worth the trouble at this point.   I feel like I went 75% and just felt since I've gone this far might as well see it through.  Not glad I did.  Never get that time back.

I thought the human npcs were really amazing and realistic in their behavior.  They acted like a human does and kudos to them.  But, at the same time, it limited the success of a mission because the human explore all parts of the ship, not just where your objective is and so it's hard to succeed in a game like this.

You have to venture out of your safe area to get sparse supplies and create a means to possible escape.   This created the tension.

They kept the same style of game play where ammo is short supply and enemies are like mini-bosses where you have to think on how you want to deal with them.  Straight on but risk using a lot of ammo or taking time to sneak behind for a kill or avoidance.   It's up to you.  I think they did a great job on this!   It is pretty graphic and gruesome so should be for mature players only.,19.8 hrs on record,N/A

Directions for objectives are the clearest and the map was hard to tell where you were.   Save points were not the best as some places I had to repeat after coming back to the game.   If you like to look for stuff and ""observe"" a space station ad nauseum before the story can move than this might be a go.  I wish there was more direction on what I needed to do.

I'm not sure what it is like to live in a war-torn city (and I hope to never know) but I believe the devs did a good job of trying to convey the times of problems citizens caught in a war have to face.   Food shortage, injuries, scavenging, depression, fear of other survivors who want to take your supplies, little comforts missing, fellow citizens who need help but you have limited resources yourself.   A lot of issues go on trying to survive.  I felt  a connection to my little avatars and a sadness when things didn't go the way I would have liked for them.  It was a good game with a sad premise.

The dev team must really have been really smart to figure out how to put together such a game.   They did a great job.   The cartoony characters threw me off, thinking it was more of a young person's game but it takes a lot of mature logic to figure out what was going on.   I can tell the dev team really enjoy space and physics because it relies heavily upon these.   It did take me awhile to bond with the game (about 15 hours).  It was ok at first and I kept going based on all the outstanding reviews.   It was enjoyable enough to get to that point but didn't hook me in until then.   It definitely had it's frustrating moments; but then again, all games usually do.    I would definitely recommend this ride.

While these can be solved through steps outside of the game, it is unfortunately something extra that you have to do to get it to work.   Other than that, the story is what made me want to keep playing.  It  was intriguing to me.  The puzzles were I guess logical but a lot of times were obtuse.    Sometimes the game would teach you that you can't do certain things but later in the game you have to do those things you didn't think were possible to solve a different puzzle.  It was frustrating but easily moved beyond to finish the story.  Also, there were areas were you aren't allowed to go and you believe that will always be the case but you later find out that you had to find a certain amount of clues before you could progress.   But for a walkthrough I had no idea I could now go where I wasn't allowed to go before.   Frustrating.   I did like the characters and the dialogue and the story.

76561198025679656,11,N/A,Recommended,A fun ride.   You get more powerful as you go.  A linear game with side missions which are optional.  These side missions will still be in the same map so if you go further or in a different direction you may get something a character is asking for or you can destroy a skynet base for xp.  It has level up trees.  It has nicked a couple  elements of fallout like the way it zooms in to character faces when dialoging and the lockpick is just like fallout.    It has a nice ending battle that makes the slow pace of the rest of the game worth it to me.      They did a good job of tying into the first two movies at the end.  The infiltrator DLC was really sweet.   Clearing bunkers as a terminator.

I guess that is the survival part of the horror.  I always felt defensive and careful with head shots.   But I felt that the game was a fair fight.   The horror part was creepy and a little bit of horror tropish but I like that kind of think (e.g. dark mental asylums, dungeons, gothic church, etc).    It was a fun, wild ride.   The story didn't make sense.    The DLC fleshes it out and fills in the wholes which makes me think they did that on purpose to make you buy the DLC.   However, the two DLC's that involve the character in the main game were NOT done well.   It was a stealth mechanic and who ever did it didn't do a good job.   Controls where clunky and the episodes seemed very unfair.  (Escpecially the first boss battle - so cheap that it might make you rage quit before ever finishing the first DLC chapter.
