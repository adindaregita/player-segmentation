76561198121696622,1,Loot River,Recommended,"So far I'm having a good time with this game. I'm enjoying the art style, the more deliberate combat style (my hands are old and wrecked, no more frantic Hades mashing for me!) the weird world and lore, the tetris sliding - particularly satisfying using the war machine, and charging attacks before moving your little tetris piece into position to unleash. Only real pet peeve with the game is seeing a lot of loot drops of starting equipment, often equipment that I already have. I'm enjoying the challenge of the game so far. Will it be another multi hundred hour roguey? It's hard to know at this point. Time (and my hours) will tell!",5.3 hrs on record																					(4.5 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198121696622,1,Dungeon Deathball,Recommended,"This is a lovely game! The gameplay is reminiscent of Into the Breach - a series of short tactical encounters, with a chance to power up your athletes between each round. The bare minimum to pass a level is to get one of your two players over the finish line. Bonus points if you can collect the gems and bring the ball with you AND do it in as few turns as possible. You can use a ""hard ball"" to boost your score - these are a fun wrinkle that stops you from being able to rinse and repeat each level with the same strong strategy. Very recommended!",10.7 hrs on record																					(8.7 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198121696622,1,As Far As The Eye,Recommended,"Yes, I would recommend this game! This is a lovely puzzle, but pretty challenging at first - very easy to spiral out, but losing a little in the beginning is all part of the fun. I really enjoy the atmosphere of the game as well as the logistic puzzle of trying to get the things you need to get to the next halt. At 12 hours in I've had one win and I think there's much more to learn in this game. I streamed this game close to its launch about a year ago and I've been thinking about it ever since!",15.6 hrs on record																					(15.6 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198121696622,2,Dice Legacy,Recommended,"I recommend this game, but it is a different game than you might be expecting, go in knowing what it is and you're more likely to enjoy what you find. It's realtime. Session length is a few hours (unless you really wipe out early). It's just as gorgeous to look at in action as it is in the trailer. It has a good savegame system and I highly recommend you use it. Each run is a bit too long for me to comfortably complete in one sitting and it might be for you too. It has satisfying decisions to be made and mostly has a nice arc but I would love a few quality of life features to reduce the amount of needless clicks, particularly when you get into the lategame. It's a challenging and original game and has some satisfying strategy decisions to make in there too. With each run being 3-5 hours long for me (and honestly quite tiring) I'm unlikely to fully fall in love with this game but I've enjoyed these 20 hours. As someone who is interested in game design it's also given me much food for thought!",22.0 hrs on record,N/A

76561198121696622,2,Mech Armada,Recommended,"I was given a copy by a friend (thanks The5thViking!) and I have to say I have been really pleasantly surprised by this one. I'm not typically wild about mech games, or turn based war tactics (aside from Into the Breach, which feels more abstract). Stages are each quite short and you get to buy parts and upgrades between fights. Every larger number of fights you get some seemingly very powerful perk type things. You get to construct your mechs from 3 parts which is a fun little puzzle too. Definitely had fun with this - and it's different enough that it's not send me scurrying off to play more Into the Breach. (The magic keys are Q & E if you want to shift the camera and justify all the 3D art.)",3.5 hrs on record,N/A

On my 3rd attempt in earnest I seem to have a settlement that hasn't death spiralled before getting established. It looks like you *really need* to get upgrades on your buildings. I feel like the notification for having 0 food would be handier as something you could set as the player? If you've got 0 food it's often too late to really do anything about it. I'm looking forward to seeing the next stage of the game now my town has 50 or so colonists. I also enjoyed consistently refusing to help the church or the king.

76561198121696622,3,Patch Quest,Recommended,"A fun well executed game. It may be in Early Access, but you wouldn't know it, certainly didn't feel like it in my first 4 hours of play. The animal lassoing is fun, the art is charming. Gameplay ramps up to a fairly frantic but not unfair level, given that most of your mounts will give you a good dodge ability. Satisfying base upgrading and pet keeping elements for those that enjoy some metaprogression. So, I recommend this! The game felt like it really clicked for me once I started getting used to the mount abilities.

It's so good that I'd recommend you try it even if you're not a fan of the tabletop version (like me). There is tonnes of content here - it's a well balanced and refined game in itself, the AIs are strong, there is online asynchronous and live multiplayer, there are tonnes of challenges, a great tutorial. The only weak point is that this is a little buggy sometimes, but rarely in a way that is catastrophic (generally you can just restart and all is fine). I'd say that this is the gold standard for how to do a videogame version of a boardgame.

76561198121696622,4,GLADIABOTS - AI Combat Arena,Recommended,"This is one of those games that if you're going to be into it, you'll know from a summary of what it is. So... you're programming the AI for a team of robots to take on another team of robots. There's no command line stuff (that's not the point with this one), you use a visual flow chart style AI decision tree with the equivalent of 'if' statements and 'action' statements. It's asynchronous multiplayer (praise be!), so you'll be matched up to other players' ghosts of a similar level. There is a league system, and it tracks your elo too. You can fast forward your matches, you can rewind, watch replays etc. The AI programming bit is about as painless as it can be. The tutorial is really good and there is a campaign you can play through too, though I've not done much of that. It also works on your phone (and you can sync it), though unless you've got a phablet it might be a bit tricky to really get into the nitty gritty of a big AI, I much prefer playing it on the laptop. So if this sounds like your kind of thing, then it probably is - the implementation of the ideas is really good and the Trello board promises more cool stuff too.",51.6 hrs on record																					(42.2 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198121696622,4,No Man's Sky,Recommended,"Post NEXT. (I have no experience pre NEXT). So this is for me a game that is sometimes brilliant, sometimes tedious. The brilliance outweighs the tediousness though so this *is* a positive review. The attraction of this game for me was always the exploring a near infinite universe aspect. And I have had a great time looking at some very pretty planets, with weird flora and fauna. Exactly why I got it. The universe presented is also interesting and strange in its own way, it doesn't feel overly derivative of any other sf property. Walking and jetpacking around is fun. On the negative side are the Sentinels. These are flying robots that don't seem to serve any purpose but to be annoying. You'll be minding your own business collecting stuff and they'll show up and start shooting you. If you fight back, more come. I have no idea what purpose they serve apart from being irritating. Then you have the crafting - I know that crafting things is very popular but if I'm going to play a crafting game, let it be interesting. It just consumes time, time spent in menus. Why, if I have the ingredients I need to do something, why is it not treated as if I have that thing? I have the ingredients to make the special launch fuel, can't we just skip a load of clicking in menus and just take it as read that, I am trying to leave the planet then of course I want to instamake the fuel and get going. I got the game to be exploring, not clicking through the same menus over and over. And, as typically the reason I want to leave somewhere is because I am annoyed with the aforementioned sentinels, at this point I just prefer to play something else. And Gods forbid you actually make it into space and then have to do some space combat. Although apparently you can get ships that are better at space combat later on, the combat I'm starting with is slow, painful and again, makes me want to play something else. And then there's the inventory management aspect. Which again is next level irritating. Sure I'm a factorio player, used to carrying around acres of factory in my pocket, but the inventory restriction doesn't serve any purpose that can be described as fun or interesting, or even realistic. Even in the course of a relatively small amount of collecting resources you end up with a full inventory. These negatives aside, I've enjoyed my time with No Man's Sky so far. It's those negatives that mean it's unlikely to be a game I fully fall in love with, but it's given me some great moments so far and I'm sure it will continue to do so (in an intermittent way). Also massive kudos to Hello Games for NOT taking the money and running.",102.2 hrs on record																					(26.0 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198121696622,5,Race for the Galaxy: Brink of War,Recommended,"I saw there were no reviews. This is the 3rd expansion in the 1st expansion arc. It is no use unless you have the previous two. I have played all the expansions for Race for the Galaxy, and this is my favourite. Don't be daunted by the takeover rules, they are optional. This expansion adds all sorts of different strategies and for me rounds the game out. The implementation is, just like the previous ones, fantastic and smooth.

76561198121696622,5,Slay the Spire,Recommended,"This game is fantastic, and due to its Early Access status, there is more to come, which is exciting. So you build a deck as you ascend this tower, fighting enemies, elite enemies, having encounters and going to the shop. You also get relics, powerups outside your deck. Currently there are 2 characters, one which is more of a tank that heals himself and the other which is more of a thief/rogue build. I have 40 more hours than logged as I played this in Offline mode too. A run where you win takes about an hour and a quarter, but unlike other roguelikes you can save mid run which is pretty good, but it is so addictive it can be hard to tear yourself away. I've also played Monster Slayers and the new Hearthstone mode but this for me is the very clear winner. Definitely worth every penny.",373.4 hrs on record																					(80.6 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198121696622,5,Race for the Galaxy,Recommended,"This is a really nice implementation of my favourite card game. It's relatively easy to get an online game. I'm hoping for a few features - some kind of ladder or elo system would be nice, but as it is it's still a very nice version of the best modern card game out there. You can play with a 30 minute or 7 day time limit and it's pretty easy to have multiple games on the go. The AI is pretty strong, but don't let that dishearten you!

76561198121696622,5,Age of Rivals,Recommended,"Simple, quick and fun. You can try it for free at Kongregate and the game is AFAIK nearly identical. It's a drafting game, games are quick and there is a nice mix of short time tactics and long term strategy. There is a good amount of skill to be had, I tried playing this when I was tired and got pwned. It's easy to get a game against a human, but the AI is strong too. There is a collection aspect to the game that I'm a little unsure of, but apparently this is much less grindy on the steam version than on the original kongregate game.

76561198127605984,1,Trials of Kokoro,Recommended,"I just beat this game and although I don't write reviews often, I was compelled to directly after watching the credits roll. Trials of Kokoro is about a man who wakes up in a forest with no memory of his past. Cliche as that idea is, the 14 hour story (in my case) that follows is a magical ride with a deep storyline and plenty of character and world building. In fact, the only complaint I have is the shortness of the adventure. Graphically the game is wonderful. There is no roaming from dungeon to town and so forth. It's on a linear path but this choice in style makes it what it is. The backgrounds for each place you visit is beautiful and there is alot of charm in the hero models that play in the visual novel-equse story scenes. The battle system is deep. This isn't your typical mash attack button layout. Buffs and debuffs are very important. Learning and knowing your enemies weaknesses are very important. Equipment depth is vast and you can change between battles to suit the needs of the oncoming opponents. The music is great too. And there are a lot of different songs involved. They fit the mood quite well. Highly recommended for people who likes strategic turn based rpgs, or just like a good story. And the difficulty settings means you can enjoy it for which ever you're there for. I played on normal and found the challenge just right.",14.2 hrs on record,N/A
76561198127605984,1,Monster Train,Recommended,"This game was a surprise hit for me. I just happened to catch a Let's Play of it on YT and decided it looked interesting. So I get the game, play it for a while, end my session and look at the time. 8 hours. I played the game 8 hours on my 1st playthough. That's how much fun I was having. Good thing it was my day off. So what is so special about the game? 1. The factions you play as actually play different. And the fact you can mix and match by choosing a sub faction to supplement your deck means there are an almost endless amount of strategic oppurtunities. 2. The flow of the game is perfect. There are 3 levels of play, it's sort of a tower defense in this way. But turn based rather than real time. You have to plan out how to kill or weaken the enemies enough that they can't get through all of your defenses. The spells help a lot with certain factions to even the odds on harder waves. 3. Progression is fun. Unlocking things in roguelikes/roguelites is hit or miss. This game hits it. You are always unlocking more things. And everything you unlock improves your next playthoughs. It's exciting to find out what you will get next. 4. Enemies are varied. Not only that, bosses have multiple forms. One of the stage 3 bosses for example has a time bomb. And depending on the interation of the boss, the bombs can hit twice, they can have a damage shield that makes it harder to get rid of, or other things. 5. There's more to it than the regular game. There's a daily challenge where you go for top of the leaderboards with set penalties and boons that everyone has. The factions, starting decks, and rules are the same for everyone so it's a matter of how good you use it rather than who is the highest level in the game. 6. It can be insanely hard, for those who like that. Like Slay the Spire, you can make the game harder through tiers that add rules as you progress making it almost impossible to win unless you really know the ins and outs of the game. I personally stick with the base difficulty, but I can see how this would add hours to someone's enjoyment of the game. Cons? I guess the fact that each game can take near an hour could turn some people off. Also, it's not an easy game even at base difficulty. But if you're a fan of rogue games, you probably like it hard anyway. Honestly, it's a near perfect experience. It rivals Slay the Spire as the best roguelike/rougelite on Steam.",46.0 hrs on record																					(27.1 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198127605984,1,ShellShock Live,Recommended,"If you are old enough to remember games like Scorched Earth and the original 2D worms, you will adore this game. Luckily for me, I find it's more Scorch and less Worms. Up to 8 players online can battle to the death, either free for all or in teams. There is single player content as well to practice on and gain levels. There is an rpg aspect as gaining levels unlocks new weapons and allows you to upgrade your tank attack power, health, luck, and fuel consumption. Some of the weapons are hilarious, like the cats, the frogs, the ""Mad Birds"" which is Angry Birds, and others.  So far, I've seen nothing but friendly players online. Chat is relaxed, no trolls.

You can see on my profile I have many, and some of them have well over 100 to 500 and more hours of play. The problem is, Dragon Cliff doesn't offer enough in either active play or idle play. It's stuck in an awkward limbo between active and idle and just isn't enough fun. And while most idle games are free with perks for people who want to gain an advantage, this game retails for 9.99 USD. The fact that it costs money is the reason why I must caution people who might be on the fence about this game. To summerize, there isn't enough content. And it doesn't know if it wants to be an active game or an idle game. I would steer clear.",8.2 hrs on record																					(8.2 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198127605984,1,7th Deep,Recommended,"Read this review if you want to find out why 7th Deep isn't 'just another rpgmaker game'. 7th Deep has a simple premise. Get to the bottom of the dungeon in order to recieve a relic that's supposed to be insane powers. It's nothing new, but it works for this type of game. You get to choose between seven characters to begin with. 2 are evil, 3 are neutral, and 2 are good. Once you choose a character, you get a 2nd character (who isn't a part of the beginning crew) shortly after and then finally as you go along you'll recruit a 3rd member from the other beginning characters you didn't choose at the start. Each character is competely different from each other. Who you choose MATTERS. One character can kill NPCs for extra loot. One can drink the blood of NPCs to heal. One can craft healing items from herbs. One will cause you to find extra tresure chests. And there's more, but I'll let you find it out yourself. Over the 50 floors, you'll find a great diversity in what is going on. There are puzzles, traps, teleporters, and more to deal with. Weak enemies will randomly run around, allowing you get the jump on them for an extra free turn. More challanging enemies will chase you down, and can get an extra turn on you if you don't face them in time. The difficulty isn't too hard, at least on the normal difficulty. I haven't tried ""survival mode"" yet. However, if you do find yourself being overpowered, the game does have the ability to teleport back to previous floors for grinding. You even get to re-open previous chests to get more loot. In this respect, you can choose whether to go straight forward for difficulty, or grind to make things simplier. There are 2 endings for each character, and 7 characters to begin your adventure with. Replay value is through the roof. And with each run taking around 9 or 10 hours, you will absolutely get your moneys worth at just $2.99.",8.5 hrs on record																					(6.9 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198127605984,1,Age of Rivals,Recommended,"Age of Rivals is a strategy card game. There is no play to win, in fact once you buy the game there isn't even an option to spend money on cards. You gain additional cards simply by playing the game. I love this feature, and wish more collective card games followed this structure. So how is the gameplay? It's very easy to learn, the tutorial is very hand holdy but perfectly explains everything there is to do with the game. And I strongly advise you do the tutorial as you get enough in game gold to buy your first couple card packs. That being said, this is a game that's deep as the Grand Canyon. There are several different ways to win a game. Decks can be influenced to be culture points oriented. Culture points are the easiest way to win, as you will get more of those by volume than anything else. You can be attack oriented, this works because you get points for the 'conquer' stage where attack matters. You also have a chance to knockout all your opponents cards before they have a chance to score. There are also so many support cards that add or subtract points, attack, defense, etc. Cards that influence your gold, cards that allow you to pick other like cards. Cards that synergize with each other to make greatest gains than they would alone. The strategy is seemingly endless. This game has both normal and hard difficulties for Single Player play. The AI is smart, even on normal. There are also challanges that allow you to get rare cards. The AI in challanges are purporsely well above even the 'hard' AI and will punish every little mistake you make. There is also muliplayer. You can play against a friend, or you can play a random person online. Playing online allows you to gain bonuses to your gold if you are in a faction. There is also a monthly leaderboard that rewards gold for people that dominate it. I have 32 hours in the game as I'm writing this and I just now unlocked every card available. There is plenty of bang for the buck. This is a highly recommended game for me.",152.5 hrs on record																					(32.1 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198127605984,1,Hero Generations: ReGen,Recommended,"Despite what a small but VERY vocal and poisonous fraction of the userbase might think, this is NOT a cashgrab. It's not a reskin. It's not simply an engine change with no added value. The basic flow of the game has you surviving through at least 15 generations as you grow stronger with each part of your lineage. You do so by building up your lifespan, your strength in battle, your ability to kill each people and monsters by shortening THEIR lifespan, and many other things I won't spoil. While most of the game is similar to the original release, graphics have been improved, interfaces have been improved, additional triats, items, etc have been added, the world map is much better streamlined. And while most people who played and enjoyed the original would paid full price to play this improvement just to support the dev (who is friendly and always willing to help, despite what before mentioned group might lead you to believe) but we didn't have to as the generous dev allowed all old players to buy the game at 2/3rd off the regular price. Ask yourself, will NBA2k17 give NBA2k16 players 2/3rd off? Not a chance. Greedy dev? Not here. Don't pay any mind to the fact that every positive review has been downvoted all to heck. Ask yourself instead, ""Why are there so many more positive reviews than there are negative?"". The fact that all the positive reviews are downvoted just shows how immature the trolls are in this case and how little of a life they have to take the time to do so. I highly recommend this game.",1.5 hrs on record,N/A
76561198127605984,1,OH! RPG!,Recommended,"I don't do reviews for most of the games I play on Steam. But some games are just too special NOT to give an opinion on. OH! RPG! is a 'launch' title for the newly released RPGMaker MV. Because MV is new (at the time the game came out) the graphics, sound, music, etc, are fresh and the dev put a lot of effort into making it professional. This isn't your typical RPGMaker game. This isn't a cash grab done in 10 hours and released with no care. As I said, the dev put in a lot of work. The maps are full of life but nothing is wasted. The paths in the dungeons are never so conviluted that you get lost. The story is top notch. You can beat the game in less than 5 hours but the 'Heroes' are complex, the NPCs that you control are quirky in the right ways, and even the actual NPCs are more deep than ""welcome to our city"". The battle system is great. This is no button masher, where you just hit attack until the enemy dies. Each chapter's character has their own moveset that MUST be used with strategy in order to get by. The bosses especially must be defeated by thought, not by brute force. The Devs on this project are very friendly, take a look at the discussion forum for OH! RPG! and you will see they are active and willing to talk about bugs, story, suggestions for additions, or anything else you wish to shoot the breeze about. This is a quality I can't value enough. Many devs forget the player exists once their money has been spent. Weakpoints? As mentioned before, you can and prob will beat this game in less than 5 hours. So, take this game for what it is. It is a short but extremely fun RPG with replay value as you have a score for each chapter that you can go back and raise any time you wish.",6.9 hrs on record,N/A
76561198127605984,1,Clicker Heroes,Recommended,"If you can't tell by the 200+ (at current time) hours I have on this game, I really like it. Be warned, this game will take away your free time. This game is free, and while it has options to pay for extra stuff, this is NOT a pay to win game. Any one with enough time can do well, the purchases only make things run a little quicker. Very basic graphics, sound, music (that you turn off after a while), and a very basic premise. The same could be said for Tetris and it did fairly well. If you have ADD, OCD, or other compulsive disorders, you'll never want to stop playing. I know from experience.",479.4 hrs on record																					(240.0 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198127605984,2,Card City Nights,Recommended,"I've been addicted to this game for the last week. It is a mix of collectable card games like Yu Gi Oh or M:TG. However, unlike most CCGs, you do not have to BUY the booster packs either through in game currency or real money. You earn them through the gameplay which is a major bonus to me. The story is better than you would expect from a game of this genre as well. If you choose to, you can find that every person you come across has several (sometimes more than a dozen) different things they will say to you. And what they say will change depending on whether or not you have defeated them yet. The actual gameplay is quite balanced. As you get stronger, so does the opponents. And there are many different strategies you must use. Going all out offense will work sometimes, but some characters are built to counter with good defense and the ability to disable your best cards at just the right times. You must choose your deck wisely depending on your opponent. This depth is part of what makes this game so fun. The art style may turn some people off but I think it's very endearing and original. I don't know any of the indie games that this takes it's characters from but it's cartoonish and quirky and simple and it fits the overall mood of the game. The best part of the whole game however must be the music. Everything from the menu screen, to the various places you visit, to the battles have music that is perfect for the situation. It's soothing and it's energizing at the same time. This, along with the humor of the game, and the visual styling make this a game you will never want to put down. Although I have not beaten it yet, I know from reading around that the game has more things to accomplish even after you defeat the 'final boss'. So replay value is strong here too.",25.4 hrs on record																					(20.3 hrs at review time),N/A
