It really reminded me of the old demos of yore, like Age of Empires 1 for example or more recently Balatro, that had so much nice content you could play it for hours and hours and never get bored. This early access release seems great so far, more content, more QoL, and more of the classic design that really gives this the ""one more year"" feel.",8.5 hrs on record																					(0.8 hrs at review time),N/A

I think it really is the best (or at least the most stuffed full of content and small strategic decisions) of the vampire survivor spinoffs of those I tried.

76561197991784193,3,Aerofly FS 2 Flight Simulator,"Action, Indie, Racing, Simulation",Recommended,"Recently I bought a HOTAS and decided to get into a VR flight sim. I heard alot of good things about X-Plane, DCS, and IL-2. I tried them all and had a good time but I eventually bounced off how difficult it was to get consistent fps in all of them. Aerofly FS 2, in contrast, you might not read many recommendations from the flight sim community. Its group of fans are smaller, but if you give the game a real go you might find you have significantly more fun in it than the other programs. The game just works. Some people might complain about the simplicity of the navigation menus to set up a flight, but I love it. From putting on the VR goggles I can get going on the flight route I want in 1-2 minutes. This might be possible in other programs, but the learning curve is much smaller here. The scenery is just beautiful in VR, particularly if you buy a couple of the DLCs like Switzerland and Northeast US. I have not seen better in VR flight sims, and the fps is much better than the competition as well. The quality of the planes are hit and miss, but it isn't a big deal because some of them are really good (like the Q400 which was added as free DLC). The F18 is obviously not simulated at anything like the high level set by DCS, but it is really fun to zoom around the beautiful scenery in fighter jets as well. I am looking forward to eventually trying the paid-for planes that are starting to come in. All in all, I strongly recommend the sim for anyone who wants amazing VR flight without spending hours trying to tune the program or always worry about huge fps dips. Alot of care has been put into the scenery and some of the planes. I plan to continue playing because I have really enjoyed it thus far.",8.8 hrs on record																					(8.4 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197991784193,3,Imperator: Rome,"Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"I am really enjoying Imperator: Rome, as I did EU4. One of the complaints that annoys me is the idea that Paradox has delivered a very bare bones game or didn't try hard enough in fleshing out the systems. So, let's compare it to EU4 v1.0 at launch in terms of features (not considering quality, both great games at launch in my view). Since I will be going off memory (and not verifying every point) there will probably be instances where I forget something that was in EU4 v1.0 at launch, or give it credit for something that was not in at launch, so anyone feel free to correct me. Artwork - IR clear win EU4 v1.0 artwork consisted of loading screen images, iconographics, details on the map, unit graphics, event images, and flags. IR contains all of these, and it is my impression that it has more of each. Furthermore, IR has a character face generator with a number of cultural sets (more than CK2 at launch for sure) and puts wonders on the map which is really nice. Map - IR clear win The graphics of the map have not only improved, it is clear that alot of care has been put into it. The way that the terrain map mode uses country colours at different zoom levels finally allows us to enjoy the beauty of the terrain whilst maintaining the political context of the political map mode (an idea first used in HOI4), and couple it with all of the other bells and whistles eclipses all other strategy game maps that I have ever seen. This is not only something that you should expect with the passing of time, the IR map is not the EU4 1.0 map with sharper edges and more bump maps, I imagine it would have taken a significant amount of additional development time to craft a map this good. Events - Tie? This is inevitably going to be subjective. EU4 v1.0 had quite a good range of generic events, and also had specific country events and events tied to circumstances. From my playtime in IR it has a roughly equivalent amount, but as with EU4 v1.0 it will depend on which country you pick. Full disclaimer I have the deluxe edition fluff pack, not sure how much that added. Government systems - IR clear win EU4 v1.0 featured monarchies and republics (afaik the tribal federation stuff came in with a DLC?), where republics were just like monarchies except you picked your candidate every few years and legitimacy was replaced with republican tradition. IR has three government types that are all more different from one another than the two EU4 v1.0 government types. Characters - IR wins by default EU4 any version does not feature characters. While the IR system does not contain as much depth as CK2 (whether at 1.0 or now) it still adds a lot to the experience. Your ruler is now a person, not three numbers listed next to a randomly generated name. Heirs are now more interesting, generals are both your conquerors and potential future threats. You can play IR without getting into the character system very much, and I imagine many reviews are based on playtime like this, but there is alot there to dig into. Armies - IR clear win EU4 v1.0 features three troop types. One does not appear till mid-game (cannons), and one becomes almost irrelevant mid to late game (horses). Troop types got buffed with technology, and country groups had different stats for each type. IR has much more than three, and each have significant pluses and drawbacks, not only to their combat performance but their speed and implications for supply. Moreover, with strategic resources (like seen in 4x strategy games) and military traditions your army composition will often differ significantly across plays. Clear win to IR here. Technoloy - IR win In EU4 v1.0 techs were constant across all countries, except some researched faster than others. This is true in IR as well, except now there are inventions which give you alot of interesting choices throughout the game. There’s also alot of flavour text attached to these inventions. EU4 1.0 tech advances did feel more significant as it opened up new parts of the game (new buildings, cannons) but the inventions system on the top of IR gives it the win to me. Population management - IR clear win EU4 1.0 abstracted population into homogeneous entities within each province. IR has a much richer simulation of population where each has an attached culture and religion, and they can move around or be promoted. The IR pop system could stand to be fleshed out further and made more interesting, but it’s clearly vastly more fleshed out to what EU4 offered at 1.0. Colonisation - Tie Both games featured colonisation in fairly bare bones form. It only became interesting in EU4 with the first expansion. I guess IR might win this one because it has migratory tribes (which EU4 lacked until a later expansion), but EU4 did have some events tied to your colonies so tie. Diplomacy - EU4 slight win This is a tough one because it’s hard to remember what was in EU4 at 1.0 and what was added later. It did, however, definitely have diplomats, royal marriages, personal unions, and inheritances. IR has multiple vassal types (which EU4 lacked until later) and character interactions which is great too. Interface - IR clear win The EU4 1.0 interface might have had less ‘where do I find X?’ instances when playing but that’s only because there was less to click and look into. IR also has a number of essential UI features that were only added to EU4 over the years like the macro builder. EU4 1.0 was micro heavy with the clicking, and lacked alot of the automation features that is in IR. Country Customisation - tie EU4 v1.0 featured sets of ideas and you could pick groups (which were opened by techs) and were constant across countries. IR has a smaller version of these ideas, but also features laws (which EU4 does not have) and also military traditions which has three branches. I think the combination of these three match idea groups. Country-specific flavour - tie Other than events, EU4 v1.0 featured idea sets for either major countries or country groups that were unlocked as you progress through ideas. There was no real choice for these, and other than flavour text that was it. IR features different military tradition branches for each country group, so while there’s less of them they also branch and have more artwork attached. So tie? Naval combat - EU4 win Got to give it to EU4 here, as it had multiple ship types. Trade - IR slight win Trade in EU4 was a big mechanic and involved using ships and sending merchants to increase trade power and push trade flows, it was pretty great even at launch. Trade in IR is very different, involving a large array of resources and setting up trade routes to chain bonuses together which interacts with pops and your military. It feels alot more like Victoria than EU4. It might come down to individual preference which is a more fun mechanic, but you can’t say IR is not as fleshed out in this area (particularly before EU4 got all of the extra additions to Trade that came in the later DLCs). Is there anything else we can compare them on? Anyway, the whole point of this was just to make an argument for why it’s silly to say that Paradox gave us a bare bones game. It is clear they have put more resources into making this game than it’s closest predecessor. There are alot of mechanics and moving parts in IR, it’s a more complex game than EU4. Where it needs to go from here is first to balance and improve on some of these parts to make a more compelling whole.",130.2 hrs on record																					(4.7 hrs at review time),N/A

76561197991784193,3,Age of Rivals,"Indie, Strategy",Recommended,"Age of Rivals is a really interesting card game that I would recommend to anyone who likes card games that are a bit different and also ancient history or games like civilization or age of empires. I suppose it would be classified as a deck building game, but the way it plays out is very unique (from what I have played) and the mechanics fit the theme of a clash of two civilizations. At the moment I am finding games in multiplayer with very little waiting. One downside is that there isn't much card art as all of the cards in each of the 9 or so categories have the same picture. The art that is there is good though.",9.2 hrs on record,N/A
76561197991784193,3,Realpolitiks,Strategy,Recommended,"My opinion of the game after playing a full game as an authoritarian Brazil are very positive. I am not good at writing about games using evocative paragraphs and narrative structure, so I will split the review into categories: Presentation/Graphics: - Presentation and graphics are a step below current Paradox, perhaps somewhere between the EU3 and EU4 Paradox eras (if that means anything to you). The map is reasonably attractive and there is a number of neat little effects like planes and ships going around the map. I love the loading the screens that feature current world leaders playing the game. - The UI is pretty good, it takes awhile to get used to but I think it's functional. It has some neat tricks that Paradox never thought of, such as right clicking a country on the map to interact with them. It needs a few things added in patches, such as a Bloc map mode and a handy way to see all current wars ongoing, and also information about what happened in peace treaties between other countries at the end of wars. Gameplay: - The game is littered with clever ideas to simplify modern concepts to keep the gameplay (and programming difficulty) managable yet interesting. For instance there is no tech or ideas that you would see in EU4, instead there are ""projects"", and there are alot of them. These projects may involve advancements in technology but also social policies, economic policies, special actions, etc. etc... Overall it gives you a feeling of having alot of options on how to develop your country, and a fair few of these projects involve gold / action point maintenance so you aren't just clicking on a list but weighing up if something is worth it for your situation. - I think the UN is implemented well, you get to propose and vote on various proposals that do a number of things to certain government types or specific countries. Unlike the real UN it's majority vote from the 12 biggest countries, but the way the Security Council currently works it would be very hard to make that into a good game so it's understandable. Same for the exclusion of the EU and NATO from the game, their inclusion would most likely make the game a bit more boring. - Do not expect a deep simulation of modern economics, but you do get the feeling that you have to balance your budget / the services you give your citizens / economic growth and you can't have all at the same time. I also like how they have modelled political change, where policies drift you away or towards democracy/authoritarianism/totalitarianism. Depending on what club you're in different countries will tend to stick together, which we observe today as well. - They have done a decent job with the war system. Instead of pushing little units around the map (which is very hard to program a good AI for) they opted for 'theatres' that you assign forces to and conduct operations. I think that was a good move to keep it more managable. There are some issues with transparency, however, such as not knowing why things are or aren't going your way. This is likely a design decision but I think defenders have a pretty big advantage, so I wouldn't invade a country of similar army size (probably good advice for real world leaders too!). - In my game I did not observe any bugs or dumb AI behaviour. This is unexpected for the genre! Throughout the 2020-2100 wars happened regularly, and the conflicts were all realistic (russia pushing eastern europe, north/south korea, flashpoints in the Middle East, some regional African aggression, etc.) although there were some odd ones too (Canada vs. US woohoo (Canada won)). - I like how blocs work, if you are very friendly with a country you can invite them to form a bloc with you. Once formed, you can try to coax others into joining and then start introducing things to better integrate the bloc, whether currency integration, open borders, political integration, etc... The more integration though the higher relations have to be otherwise a country in the bloc will seek to leave it (much like what is happening with the EU). Blocs fight wars together so even as a small country you can try to punch above your weight. - The random events are all interesting and varied, you encounter quite alot of them during a single game but there was very little repetition which is a good thing (when I start a new game repitition will obviously increase though). Balance / Small Things: - The two currencies in the game (gold and action points) begin to unravel towards the end of the timeline. If you're playing well gold starts to exponentially increase around the middle of the time frame (playing as a fairly large country as Brazil, this is probably much less of a problem with small countries) while action points stay tight throughout but towards the end can be easier to game. I think there are some simple ways to alleviate this, which I will probably post in the forums. - To counteract above the gold and action point requirements scale up later in the game, but some things (like from events) don't scale so you can get weird comparisons where something very cool costs you 2000 gold while some minor thing from an event drain 60,000 action points which is alot. - Random events can give you relations debuffs that can very quickly unravel a bloc (especially a more integrated ones). Again I think there are simple ways to alleviate this in a patch. Summary: I heartily recommend the game to anyone who is interested in modern politics, grand strategy games, regular strategy games, or anyone looking to try something different (there's a demo too to give a go). It isn't a paradox killer, yet nor is it priced like one, and by covering the near future it fits a large hole in grand strategy games. I am very impressed that the dev studio was able to tackle such an ambitious game with this degree of polish. I really hope the game thrives and expands with patches and DLC, and I also hope to see more grand strategy games by these devs in the future.",10.3 hrs on record																					(8.5 hrs at review time),N/A
