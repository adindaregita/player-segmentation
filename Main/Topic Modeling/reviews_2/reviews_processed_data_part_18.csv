On the one hand, the games are often the prettiest examples of the genre at the time they came out, but then you open the package and everything is just so slow.  All the units move slow, there's nothing very interesting to explore on the map other than cities you have to conquer, when you finally upgrade your hero, none of the skills are exactly game changing.  the first game had some terraforming spells and units and I always hope the new ones will build on that but if anything terraforming becomes less important (certainly compared to the slightly more Civ-like game Warlock).  I don't know.  I just need more of a feeling of exploration and development beyond a bigger army and conquering the map.",16.5 hrs on record,N/A
76561197986997483,1,Pilgrims,"Adventure, Casual, Indie",Recommended,"This game isn't really my sort of thing.  First of all it looks like a card game, but there's no card game element at all.  The cards are just items like in any other adventure game.  Basically, the game is that you drag the items over various things in the environment and see what happens.  it's not really puzzle solving like in a traditional adventure because the game wants you to try every combination so you can see all the cute animations.  It also wants you replay the game many times because you can't see all the combinations in one play through.  I guess I find all the trying everything a bit tedious and would rather the story be presented more straightforwardly as a choose your own adventure, maybe.",1.0 hrs on record,N/A
76561197986997483,1,Cosmobreeder Yiffai,"Action, Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"I really like the map layout and all the secrets and upgrades and extra things to do in this platformer, but the boss fights are really difficult slogs that I'm just not up to.    The game offers cheats if you die and i've decided to take them and make my attacks twice as strong for each boss, I guess because the cheats are suggested by the game, I will still give it a thumbs up. Again, the parts that aren't the boss fights are fabulous.  It's probably the most enjoyable platformer I've played since Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom on that account.  I would have a love a Star Fox game like this one the SNES back in the day.",5.7 hrs on record																					(5.3 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197986997483,1,Samorost 3,"Adventure, Casual, Indie",Recommended,"I played Samorost way back in the Kongregate days and thought it looked neat but there wasn't much game there.  I think my sister bought me Samorost 2 here on Steam, though I may be wrong about that, but regardless, I didn't really care for that.  it was very short for a premium game and the art was about the same as Samorost 1.  In neither case were the puzzles worth mentioning since there were all click on everything that is clickable then find out if you progress.  But THIS GAME is GREAT.  It has so much more to show than Samorost 2 and the puzzles finally feel more like puzzles.  Part of why this is possible now, is because the game does more to tell you what the goal of the area is rather than just let you find out when it happens.  The environments have a lot more diversity and detail too.  I like the universe which at times reminds me of The Little Prince or Fantastic Planet (La Planete Sauvage) and even a bit of the works of my favorite animator, Jan Svankmajer, I say it reminds me of these things, but it is still very much it's own thing. After a kind of neat first game, and a disappointing second game, finally there's one that's highly recommended.  And I probably wouldn't have found this out if the developers hadn't been supporters of Ukraine.  I bought the game because it was on a sale where they gave all the profits to a humanitarian aid charity for Ukraine.",2.2 hrs on record,N/A

It makes me feel like I'm developing my characters and gives the game a bit more substance.  I think it could be better still.  Rather than choosing different heroes each time, it'd be nice to have the same ones and choose ways for them to develop too like in the Legacy version of this.

76561197986997483,1,A Date in the Park,Adventure,Recommended,"I always leave reviews of games I complete partly just for myself.  I do feel a bit bad about leaving a poor review for a free one that wasn't overly bad, but I really wouldn't recommend this.  Its ending isn't really very satisfying.  It feels like the bad ending in a game that should have three endings.  And leading up to it is just walking everywhere and looking at everything over and over again with little direction until the plot advances (reminds me a bit of Phantasmagoria 2 on that account.)  But I suppose this is probably a first attempt by the developer to get experience to build a proper game, and I would be happy to try that game.  All the other games by Cloak and Dagger Games look intriguing.  (although also given the role of the duckling in this game, I'm not sure I would agree with this designer's moral outlook, so do I really want to spend more time in their world?) For this game to get a good review it would have to at least add in the other endings it calls out for based on your choices, Especially because it does seem to ask you to make some more moral choices along the way like do you help the duck (although I think you probably are forced to make them for the game to advance so I guess they aren't choices....)  For this game to knock it out of the park, it would need puzzles and for the ""riddles"" to actually be riddles you have to solve.",0.9 hrs on record,N/A

Works great, with a few caveats  (sometimes the game doesn't recognize the buttons on my controller and I have to restart it.  also, every once in a while the quality degrades and things become choppy and make me sick.  but if I hold out for a bit it gets better again) I like how things change around you and not just on the table.

76561197986997483,2,Chants of Sennaar,"Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"This is a very pretty game.  I think there should have maybe been a ""hard"" mode where they never provide you with the official translations of the hieroglyphs.  In real life, you can be wrong about a symbol for a long time.  Just in general you see little glimmers of what the language puzzles could be but never quite get to.  For instance, early on in the first area you might notice that places that store things are a box with a rudimentary version of the symbol for the thing inside.  Well, it's nice that you notice that but you're never asked to extrapolate information like that to progress the game or even to open side things (although in the final area which is for some reason in a different style and even simpler than the earlier ones) you are shown this idea more explicitly. I think it would have been nice to have some characters you could interact with and say things to and give instructions to, but maybe it would have been too hard to code. But yeah, I did quite like exploring the tower.  I liked that the stealth portions were simple enough to not frustrate you (and it's fine to have them there for a little variety)  I love that the puzzles were of a genre that was only at most ever touched on in other adventure games.   I just wish the plot and puzzles were a bit more complex.  I suppose that's my feeling about most modern adventure games.",10.5 hrs on record,N/A
76561197986997483,2,Almost My Floor: Prologue,"Adventure, Indie, Free To Play",Recommended,"This was a demo, not a prologue... I like the art style and the sense of humor.  The sense of humor even makes it through the at times awkward translation.  The plot reminds me of Downfall by the guy who made the Cat Lady, but this isn't on that level.  This is so short it's difficult to have much of an opinion on it but it's the kind of game I like so I'll probably get the full game when I have a free weekend.",0.6 hrs on record,N/A
76561197986997483,2,Zaccaria Pinball,"Action, Casual, Indie, Simulation, Sports, Free To Play, Early Access",Recommended,"Changed my review to negative until they roll back the update that replaced the art on 50 tables with AI art.  There's not even an option to not use the AI art.  This isn't the game I bought anymore. Several years ago I got several of these tables in a bundle for cheap.  And it was kind of interesting that they were based on real life tables, but compared to more Pinball FX (or even real life tables I was more familiar with like those by Williams and Stern and Gottlieb) these were pretty simplistic tables and could only hold my interest for so long.  I think the makers of the game realize that and have lots of ideas to make them interesting nonetheless.  These include Story Mode and Campaign mode.  Story mode takes you on a tour of all of the tables available in the game (seemingly in approximately the order they were made) and gives you a goal on each one of a specific (not usually very difficult to achieve) goal to achieve on each one at which point you immediately advance to the next table.  It seems to include tables you don't even own which is pretty cool.  Campaign Mode arranges the pinball tables in a map reminiscent of Slay the Spire-style roguelike games.  It has similar goals to story mode but you get gold for completing the goals which gives you upgrades to things like your flipper length or the amount of time you have to complete the goal.  Both of these modes are really cool. Finally, they have some remakes and deluxe tables, neither of which exist in real life.  The remake tables are probably what you want to buy if you're getting the game to play on your desktop computer.  They reinterpret the themes of the real life tables into games that are more or less equivalent to Williams and Stern complexity and make them more interesting to play and unlock things.  The deluxe tables are NOT things you want to buy to play on your desktop computer.  they have many levels to the tables and ramps and things that crossover each other and obscure the ball.  They look messy and not fun to play on a desktop computer.  HOWEVER, I also got the VR DLC and THAT is what these deluxe tables seem to be made for.  They are really very cool to look at in VR.  And you can see the ball and the entire maze like levels that way.  I highly recommend the game with the deluxe tables in VR.  It's probably the most fun I've had with my VR headset yet and the best virtual pinball I've played.  As a competitor for pinball fx on a 2D-desktop computer, this whole game just a curio, however. *I will add however, that the VR is a bit glitchy.  If this was a game where you had to move around a lot you'd probably throw up.  This game claims to still be in ""early access"" so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they will fix it up.",8.6 hrs on record,N/A
76561197986997483,2,Pinball FX,"Simulation, Free To Play",Recommended,"It's difficult to review this game because it is certainly worse in a number of ways from the previous iteration, Pinball FX 3.  However, the new tables are good, and if I didn't have Pinball FX 3 to compare this to, I would definitely give this a positive review. Among the things I don't like about the program is the main one most people will complain about, which is that the tables from Pinball FX 3 don't port into it.  Furthermore, Pinball FX is split into two programs, this one and Pinball M (which has teen rated tables in it) so you have to have three programs installed on your computer to have access to all your tables and you have to close them and open them in order to switch between them.  What's more, Pinball FX 3 and Pinball M are both around 7-9 Gb, PInball FX is over 40, and it has a fraction of Pinball FX 3's tables! So, yeah, there's that.  There's also how long it takes to load the main screen.  I suppose because it's all 3D crap.  This is really part of the complaint about having to have three separate programs installed because it takes so long to switch between them.  So, you're stuck really with just the handful of new tables you have here.  Why not just have a simple menu to choose pinball tables.  Zen could even maybe create a frontend that would list all of your tables and let you load into whichever one you like? A third, and more minor, complaint is that in Pinball FX3, each table was associated with one achievement that was fun to unlock, it gave me the feeling of ""completing"" a table.  Here you seem to be constantly unlocking little achievements for every minor thing and a huge splash or bunch of numbers obscure your screen to tell you you've done it. I mostly have the Zen originals here.  None of the new licenses really appeal to me, except Princess Bride, and although I don't have it yet maybe the pack that includes Battlestar Galactica and Xena (maybe they'll make an SG1 table in future?)  Because of that, I haven't bought the other licensed things, with the exception of Universal Classics which came in a bundle.  The Universal Classic tables aren't good.  The Princess Bride table has some good ideas but gosh it takes a long time before that table gets to any of them.  The Zen Orignal tables are all fabulous however, and that's why I have to give this game a recommendation despite my frustrations.  Pinball Noir solid.  Grimm's Fairy Tales solid.  the samurai one, the jules verne one, the air pirates one.  They're all creative and great fun.  In the bundle I also got a Williams pack (my third one if you count the two williams packs I have on FX2) and Black Rose might be my favorite table over all. Well, it's fun, just be aware of dedicating a chunk of hard disk space and waiting on long loading times.",11.1 hrs on record																					(7.4 hrs at review time),N/A

I've reinstalled it and given it another go probably a dozen times, but I never get very far because even though I like puzzle dungeons, I just hate the combat system, which is run away while firing in real time.

76561197986997483,2,The Feast,"Adventure, Casual, Indie, Simulation, Free To Play",Recommended,"I think the allegory of the game works really.  I was reminded a bit of the absurdist film, The Exterminating Angel.  But as a horror game it fails.  You're told who the various characters are, but you don't really get to meet them or become involved with them, so nothing feels real which detracts from the suspense.  Instead, it's almost a comedy, just one with no jokes.  I think I must have gotten the game for free at some point, but if it's free somewhere (it's off of steam completely now), I'd say it's certainly worth playing once, and seeing what you think of it.  As I say, the allegory is intriguing and works.  But I probably won't be playing it again to unlock the various endings.",0.4 hrs on record,N/A
76561197986997483,2,Gray Dawn,"Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"I think it's pretty good.  It's mostly what is termed a ""walking simulator""  but there are a few hidden object and light puzzle elements so that that's not all you do.  I like that the story is a bit ambiguous.  But the really selling point on this one is the neat visuals.  The only thing I don't care for is that you can miss some of the collectibles without any warning which makes attaining the ""good"" ending impossible.  I might be willing to replay the game to try and get it again, but I would want to do so after a while rather than right away, and then I think I'd be just as likely to miss the collectibles again....  But yeah, I'd recommend it if you like games like Layers of Fear, and play it mostly for the art.",3.5 hrs on record,N/A
76561197986997483,2,The Lord of the Rings: Adventure Card Game - Definitive Edition,"Adventure, RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"This is a weak recommendation.  What's good about this game is the cosmetic stuff.  The story, the voice acting, the card art.  Unfortunately the game play is dated are repetitive.  Cards are troops that each side lines up and tries to take out.

76561197986997483,3,Aeon's End,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy",Recommended,"So, the theme of this game (post-apocalyptic sorcerers vs. Cthulhu) does absolutely nothing for me and I wouldn't have looked twice at it except that we sell two different flavors of it (the base game and a legacy version) in the board game store I work in.  I thought I maybe buy it long enough to demo it so I knew how it worked, but surprise surprise, I enjoyed it quite a bit and decided instead to buy all the DLC. If you like Legendary, it is broadly similar to that.  On the negative side there's a bit less of an adventure game feeling over the length of a session than Legendary, which has more of a feeling of exploration and puzzle solving with the bosses, however there's a lot of other neat things to make up for that.  I like that you purchase new cards from piles that always available, like Dominion.  The fact that you can choose what order you can stack your deck is neat too, for pulling off combos (presumably, I mostly have used the function to destroy cards I don't like that are sitting on top of my discard, but I'm interested in exploring it more later)  The different heroes also feel very different from one another despite the fact that they are building their decks from the same cards, but the designers have really used what is available to make each mage unique as creatively as possible. I suppose the main negative is the lack of mulitplayer.  I don't love playing different characters by myself, in the forum it says they are planning multiplayer but it's been a couple of years since the last expansion, so I think the game is probably as complete as it will be.  Still, there's a lot here already.

It's not like the last few chests I've found have been associated with puzzles, they've just just been in out of the way crannies. The first Supraland was like candy to me that I couldn't stop eating until I was finished with it.  This one has it's moments.  I liked the bank and prison area particularly, and combat--while not good yet--is much better than in the first game. But quite a bit of it was same old/same old, and also I'm not convinced about the overall structure of the game.  In this game you complete the story at around 50% and then there's still more upgrades and chests to find for the second half of the game.  I like the little dudes and their humorous observations, so the game really lost something once there was no more of that. I also think that since the second half of this game is almost entirely backtracking, there should be things that change in the places you revist.  Particularly in the area bad guy's dungeon.  You've defeated him but there are still prisoners down there and they say the same things. So yeah, I recommend it.

It's similar to other games where advisors and petitioners come up to you and you just make yes/no decisions, but it includes greater strategic depth because you have to keep your levels of different resources balanced.  It also includes a city building part in between the rounds similar to Darkest Dungeon.

(there is also a support the developer DLC but this sounded more interesting than that.)  So, I'm not really upset that I paid $3 for this since my point was to tip the developer.  However.  If you are not buying this for that reason, there is next to no content here.  It says it's a short story, well it's shorter than a short story; it's not even five minutes.

The narrator is very slow and the story doesn't have enough explanation to be understandable (and I read Henry Stanley's book!)  The gestures for moving things are very difficult to accomplish, at least for me.  taking long swipes with the mouse in unintuitive directions for even simple things like opening doors.  Turn screws is worse and half the time I barely start them turning in the proper direction and then I get to the edge of my mouse pad and after recentering the mouse, I start pulling it in the same direction and the screw starts turning backward.  Really I could pull my hair out.

Maybe I don't really know what I'm supposed to be doing, but I found the experience very unpleasant, you start with a FMV movie that's fairly interesting as those things go, and it leads you to believe you're going to play something like Gabriel Knight 2 or a Tex Murphy game or maybe Phantasmagoria, but then you're dropped into a dark ugly mansion where a voice that wasn't introduced insults you whenever you try to inspect anything. I managed to find two puzzles, one was an okay puzzle where you switch the positions of some knights on a modified chess board the other was a dumb puzzle where you had to do some things with some keys on a cash register.  The only way to know what to do with the keys is to press the hint button which provides the instructions (and it's not something you can figure out without instructions by fiddling about since what you have to do is arbitrary and you only get any feedback once you've successfully completed it)  so you have to press the hint button, but nothing really tells you how many times you should press the hint button to get just the instructions and not actual hints.  That's very poor design in my opinion. I don't know.

I suppose some bundle.  :-)  It's a sort of puzzle game, but the puzzles involve some randomization, so there isn't really a perfect way to play, more like an optimal way to play.  You draw to cards each turn, each of which lets you move like a chess piece, and then you play them trying to kill all the opposing pieces on the board as quickly as possible so you can make cash which lets you upgrade your cards (ideally to let you take more turns)  There are a variety of different army types you can play against, the first leaves behind blight that hurts you if you end your turn on the space and the second lets off special abilities if you take a second turn, will see what the rest do.  :-)",0.7 hrs on record,N/A

76561197986997483,4,Islands of Insight,"Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"I think the game is fabulous.  I could hardly stop playing from when I bought it and have gone on for 10 hours.  Part of what makes it so addictive is that you can't help but turn around and find something else to do.  I will say that unlike the Witness, none of the puzzle types I've seen so far have been something completely unique or required too much out of the box thinking.  Instead how I'd describe the game is sort of like all the puzzle parts of things like Arkham Asylum or Zelda without any of the repetitive combat.  It also does not have a very strong story to pull you through.  You do find bit of lore or god-like beings talking to you now and then, but I have no idea what any of it has to do with the gameplay. I would recommend this game to people who like the exploring and puzzle solving aspects of action adventure games.  (with the action limited to occasional races and flight challenges).  It's for people who like to explore every bit of an area in those types of games and check off every single achievement.

In particular, I was impressed with his still lifes which I don't normally find so interesting.  The beach scene, which reminded particularly of a Where's Waldo, was also very surprising and seemed to filled with little jokes.  I think this hidden object idea was a very interesting way to explore the paintings, too.  Usually, I take in a painting all at once, this made me look at each thing in the painting and think about it separately.  I'm not sure that that's the best way to appreciating art, but I did see things I might not have seen otherwise.",1.2 hrs on record,N/A

76561197986997483,4,The Sea Will Claim Everything,"Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"I came to this game because I really loved the writing in Talos Principle and this is by one of the writers of Talos Principle, but....it's not for me.  Maybe it's for you, but when I see new screen in this game, I don't think ""Hey!  Look at all the things to explore!""  Instead, I think, ""Oh my gosh, I have to click on all of that?""  I do wonder if i'd like the game if all that was delivered in tooltips.  It's such a small change that you wouldn't think it would make or break the game, but I think having the descriptions appear where the mouse was would really make the experience more organic. Also, the game is proud of its dozens of characters, but I don't know if they really qualify as characters because they are all very static and don't do anything.  they are more like the townsfolk in the more traditional RPG's whose dialogue is hidden within nested dialogue trees.  This just doesn't make anything they say feel real or dynamic the way actual dialogue in books does.  And I don't know why games do it.  Maybe it's because they are so worried about letting you feel like the protagonist is you, that they are afraid to put words in your mouth.

I was aware of PYST but thought it sounded dumb, and I knew of the Boggit and Bored of the Rings, but I'd never played the games they were parodying for more than three minutes, so I never looked at them either.  I can't even name any other video game parodies, but what a perfect game to send up. I will say I really liked the Witnesses' puzzles and out of the box thinking, and gorgeous environments, and also I thought some of the philosophical stuff was fun to explore, but I was really hard on it for its lack of story and almost offensive ending.  Especially when compared to Talos Principle which did the philosophy and story much better.  I think probably the maker of this game feels similar to the way I do.  What a fun send up, and it actually plays like a competent game too.

76561197986997483,4,Space Rangers: Quest,"Adventure, RPG",Recommended,"This game has more in common with those solo roleplaying game books from the 80's and 90's than a modern computer game.  If you want to play something like Lone Wolf in outer space, you can't really do any better than this. I own the Space Rangers games, but I haven't played them very much.  So, unlike some of the negative reviews I'm not comparing this to those games.  But I think this one is good for what it's trying to do.  If there were some changes I would make, it would be to port the turn based space combat from the other game to the space combat here.  Having that be all text is a bit disappointing.  And also, it has kind of an odd premise where although what you're doing has importance to the real world, the game takes place in a virtual reality environment and that makes me care less about the choices I make beyond how they affect me, because the other people in the quests aren't real... There is another issue I have with the game:   it's hard to read the text when its stretched out across your entire computer screen.  It would be a LOT more playable if the you could adjust the width of the text window to your liking.  Even better still would be if this were ported to Android.",3.9 hrs on record,N/A
76561197986997483,5,Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Action, Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"I will leave me original review below, but I finally finished the game!  I am officially no longer a chicken!  :) Overall the mansion portion at the beginning and the (we'll call it a) church portion at the end were by far the best.  The Dungeon was stupid and had too many monsters in it.  The least scary thing to have happen to you in a horror game is to die.  You have to have the possibility of death (because of the lack of that, Layers of Fear wasn't scary at all), but the game also has to be easy enough that you basically never actually die (and fool you that it isn't).  Outside of the dungeon, I died, I think 1 time, that was perfect.  But in the dungeon I died enough times that I started to learn the nature of the monsters, the capabilities of their AI's, things of that sort, and it not only ruined that section with frustration, but made them less scary for the rest of the game. The sewers were also not great, they felt like filler.  The morgue in the sewers was good, but why was a morgue in the sewers?  The rest of the game was great though!  I also like that in the end it makes you think more about the Amnesia ""universe"" and makes me want to explore it more in more games. Original review follows. ############## I have been aware of Frictional Games since the first Penumbra Tech demo came out.  I've always been a big fan of adventure games.  They are probably the only kind of game I'm likely to play all the way to the end.  I love solving puzzles to advance a plot.  The plot makes you care about the puzzles and the puzzles keep the plot fun.  To me it's the perfect kind of game.  Well, a lot of sites that like adventure games really were interested this Penumbra Tech demo and the kind of physics based puzzles it made possible.  Aren't we all getting tired of combining items in our inventory?  I certainly was.  I missed the greater variety of puzzles text adventures had and was going back to those rather than play another identical half-finished game from Microids.  So, I was excited to try this Penumbra Tech demo, and I enjoyed.  When Penumbra Overture and Penumbra Black Plague came out, I enjoyed those too. And then Amnesia came out....  Now, I'm no adventure game purist, I'm okay with cross genre affairs.  I'll happily play an action-adventure Tomb Raider type game, or a puzzle platformer.  I was happy with the frights, here and there through the Penumbra games; the worm sections were by far the scariest parts and yet they felt so clever to me and will always be what I think of when I think of those games.  But Amnesia it is just barely relenting terror from the first scene.  Going to a new room is a loathsome task because you know it will be too dark to get your bearings and there is bound to be something in there with you.  Because of the premise revealed by the title, your goal is not something you feel particularly motivated to achieve.  If I were really in this situation, I would choose to leave by one of the windows and contact the police.  I certainly wouldn't be going below ground level where they might be no way back.  Not too long into the game, I said, why am I putting myself through this?  And I turned of the game and forgot about it. Then Soma came out and I was lured back to Frictional games by a sci fi plot and an underwater setting.  I suppose it was a horror game, it did have monster, but Soma's monsters weren't too scary, less scary than the Penumbra fauna, in my opinion.  I was able to finish that and enjoy the game despite them, in fact they probably livened things up a bit.  Then I didn't really think about Frictional games for a while.  Their next game was a sequel or a prequel to Amensia, I wasn't interested in that.  But then I got that prequel/sequel (companion) in a humble bundle.  It wasn't what I was going after in the bundle, so I left it be until right now this Halloween 2023.  I thought, I should play horror game since I'm still up and everyone else is in bed and I should celebrate the holiday.  I loaded up Amnesia: Rebirth. I loved it.  (At least what I've played so far)  I was far more invested in the main character and her story than I was with this gormless Daniel of the first Amnesia game.  And what was happening to the woman from Rebirth had surprising developments right from the first couple of scenes.  Plus, I enjoyed that it was more sci-fi than supernatural.  It didn't have much for puzzles in the part I was playing, and it was barely scary.  It felt more like a walking simulator, than an adventure or horror game, but that was fine.  I mean I've hated most walking simulators, but that's mostly because even a story is usually barely present.  Rebirth, as I say, had a fascinating story.  But as I decided I liked that game a feeling of cheating came over me.  I've never finished Amnesia, what do I think I'm doing playing this sequel?  I ruin all the surprises of the plot of the first one.  Already, I've discovered that apparently the mystery of Amnesia is going to be rooted in science fiction rather than fantasy.... So, I clicked exit game on Amnesia: Rebirth and downloaded Amnesia again. I just hate this game.  Oh my gosh.  Why would anyone choose to put themselves through this?  It's just what I said before.  It's just looking in dark rooms of difficult to determine size, while at any moment something awful might happen to you.  There are really puzzles.  It's more just searching searching searching for whatever might serve as a key to the next area, all while trying to conserve your lantern oil and match sticks.  Good grief.  I think I'm about half way through the game at this point.  I suppose it is related to Rebirth in that there is some backstory about an archaeological expedition that uncovered some orb that I suppose is related to the things the woman in Rebirth is finding in her caves,  but my goodness, these little drips of information come so sparingly.  What reward is there for pushing on?  You finish one murky area, running at the last minute from some unholy monstrosity and the next thing you have to do is head through the next door for more of the same.  (By which I don't mean the game is repetitive.  Maybe it is a little bit, in the broad strokes.  But it's generally been pretty creative with just what the horrible thing is.  What you do in the water area, for instance, is much different from you do in the prison) I don't know who this game is for.  It's not for me.  I want to be driven forward by satisfying my curiosity, not by, I suppose, proving I have a steel will.  To an extent, if I continue and finish the game, I suppose that curiosity will be what pushes me forward, but more for what it will reveal to me for when I return to Rebirth, than whatever I hope to find in this game. But do I recommend it?  Well, if you know that this is a scary game and that is the whole point of it, and you think that sounds like a good time, then yes, I highly recommend it.  I don't think you could possibly do any better. If I can bring myself to play more of this game tomorrow, perhaps I will update this review.  If I can't play more of this game tomorrow, I suppose I will just move on to sunnier fields.",12.1 hrs on record																					(5.7 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197986997483,5,Penumbra: Requiem,"Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"This is a very weak recommendation;  I think this game deserves its Mixed score.  It's an okay time solving the collection of 9 puzzle rooms.  What the game is really missing is any sort of story to give what you're doing weight.  Honestly it reminds me more of Myst than of the earlier Penumbra games in that most of your time is spent fooling around with various inexplicable machines.  But unlike Myst, the environments are NOT very pretty to look at.  Far from alien planets and strange islands, here you see sewers, warehouses, furnaces, arctic wastelands all rendered in the simplest way.  The first level has a strange temple.  If only they'd kept that scenario the whole way through. These machines you get running don't build together the way you like and there's no reason to do any of this except to take a portal to the next isolated level.  The only really connection to Penumbra is that one or two of these levels recall important places from the earlier games and characters from the earlier games some times talk to you, mostly to taunt you, but not to expand the plot in any way.

Well, years and years later I completed the game.  I got too scared back when in came out.  :-P  But that was because I was sneaking and trying to hide from the monsters as worked in the first game.  In this game, it's much easier to run from them (like we always shout at characters in horror movies to do).  Once I figure that out, this one was a lot less scary.  I think it was quite a bit of fun, though. The puzzles all make sense.  The plot is not terribly unique but it's fun to discover it all the same. I suppose I just wish I could have gotten to decide for myself what my final E-mail said, though.  Also, I don't totally understand the nature of Clarence.  And also, i remember feeling a bit more of a connection to Red in the first game than the female scientist who provides the same role in this one. One other comparison between this game and the last one I might mention, is that in the first game you were given some weapons that you soon found to be wholly inadequate to the task.  Having them in the first place gave me an idea I had some control over what would happen and having that taken away was part of ramped up the tension.  Perhaps it wouldn't make sense for this game to have the conceit again, but knowing the game doesn't ever expect you to fight does make it feel a bit less real to me, and a little safer. All told it took me a little under 5 hours to complete in two sittings.  I found all of the notes but only 6 of the 10 collectible artifacts.  I quite liked how the scary monsters were in the hallways and the puzzles were in the rooms so that you didn't have to hide while solving puzzles.  I probably wouldn't have completed the game had the overlapped.  I remember quitting the GBA game, Golden Sun, because I'd have to pause puzzles in the middle to attend to unavoidable random combat. I'd recommend this game to puzzle fans more than horror fans, even though the puzzles were pretty light.  Sometimes it's fun to solve light puzzles that make sense, and I say the horror dissipates in this game once you know where to expect it and how to avoid it (and completely evaporates by the end).

76561197986997483,5,Beyond a Steel Sky,"Action, Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"I didn't play Beneath a Steel Sky when it first came out.  But, I played it when GOG added it for free, so quite a long time ago still.  I don't remember it perfectly, but I don't really think this game makes sense as sequel.  The plot is too similar to the first game, more like a remake, while the timeline seems all janked up.  I wonder if this game started out as a spiritual successor and then was turned into a sequel part way through. I'll explain.  You explicitly play the same character as the first game, and he looks no older than in that game and yet 2 regime changes have happened in the city since game 1 and everybody living in the city can't seem to remember it any other way.  At one point you discover a zip code from the era when you were first in the city and only a couple of people are even able to recognize it as that.  Later you meet you a guy who regards your robot companion from the first game as a god and the events of the first game as myth, and yet when you talk to him you are offended to be thought of as around his age rather than around his daughter's age.  It's really weird. Then let's mention the myth of your previous visit to the city.  In it, the story goes that you left your robot companion as king of the city when you left (I think the author of the first game must have been a Wizard of Oz fan).   He ruled the city benevolently for what seems like generations bringing them into a new age of prosperty and happiness and then left the city to strike out into the desert leaving behind a board of wellmeaning civil servants to rule in his place.  (all of this while your character doesn't age at all, again)  Well, in the current game, you visit a museum where you can see 3D recreation of memorable objects from the first game  (a fun idea).  In this museum is the chip board of your robot.  (He didn't leave into the desert at all!)  In the museum the chip board has been hooked up to a speaker and can talk to people but the security guard has removed power from the machine because the robot was too rude.  Well, already this doesn't make much sense, how can people believe that the robot left to the desert if they can directly talk to him?  Maybe they don't really believe it is him but just a recreation?  But then after you manage to steal the chipboard, the city news feed announces that some one has stolen their savior from the museum!  So, they do believe that that was really Joey?  How did this script get approved? Well, the story isn't everything in a game, even if it's so front and center as it is in this one.  But at least for the portion of the game I played, the puzzles aren't great either.  most of them involve this game's version of hacking which is to open up a screen where you connect to all the wifi devices in the area and move hightlighted subroutines between them.  But this is really frustratingly implemented.  The range of your hacking device is very limited and much of the game time is spent positioning yourself just so and waiting until all the robots moving around that you need to interact with all happen to be in range of your device at the same time.  The worst example of this is when I quit playing the game.  You have to annoy this poet guy out of a coffee shop so you can interact with his kindle-like device.  To do this you have to put the most annoying, loud, blaring music through the coffee shop's loud speaker so that he is so annoyed he has to leave.  They have the total cacophony of the awful music, him complaining, security guard robot sounding their sirens while you work on the actual hacking stuff and then thing you need are all moving around so you can never get just what you need on your hacking device, and there's some trial and error here too because you have to figure things out.  Like in any adventure game, ideas that you think will work don't work and only what the designers have thought up will actually matter.  It was so obnoxious and frustrating that finally I had to tear off my headset and calm down. In addition to that there are some bugs.  Sometimes (often) you move up to people and the trigger to talk to them doesn't appear.  Sometimes I have to run back and forth to the person and all around them until I'm able to get to talk to them.  Ugh. So, I didn't finish the game.  Maybe the puzzles farther in are brilliant and make you feel clever for solving them.  Maybe the plot and even the timeline somehow finally make sense in the end.  But it's just too annoying for me to find out.",8.4 hrs on record,N/A

The mixed feelings come from the lack of smoothness in the experience.  I feel like in a puzzle game once you figured out the puzzle, it should be quite easy to complete it.  That's the reward.  Figuring out puzzles in this game reminds me more of exploiting glitches in poorly programmed platformer.  You have to do things just so and hope for a bit a luck in order to get things done.  I don't love it.  I also don't like the way in which the story has been implemented.  Story should be more synthesized with gameplay, or why is it part of the game?  But it's good enough.

76561197986997483,5,Summit of the Wolf,"Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"I suppose this one is kind of one step forward two steps back from the previous entry in the series, Stonewall Penitentiary.  One of the things that edged that game up into the recommend category for me was that I thought the villain's backstory was a bit interesting.  I'll try to discuss it without spoilers here (i'll even not use pronouns since the suspects include men and women in that game),  the villain had been responsible for someone's death, but had been forgiven for it and since that time the villain had been consumed by an overwhelming guilt over event.  To an extent, the villain perhaps might have thought that the punishment they were inflicting on the other characters was to their benefit.  So, that they could be punished for their crimes.  (Maybe.  There were some lines found in the villain's dialogue that suggested that was maybe that was just a justification for the villain's actions and that really the villain just wanted to torture people.  But maybe both things can be true.  The villain is insane and has disordered thinking.  That is all part of what make the villain interesting.) In Summit of the Wolf, we're back to villains like in this writer's games before Stonewall Penitentiary, where they are simply evil.  No attempt has been made to get into their heads whatsoever.  And presumably these people are sane.  At the very least, the father is a ""Professor of Psychology at an Elementary School"" (whatever that could possibly mean.  Those must be some pretty advanced kids.)  So, he must be fairly intelligent and be aware of his actions.  Surely, he would have some justifications for himself to excuse his appetites.  The mother we learn even less about. And then there is the ways this story is a sequel to The Filmmaker and Shady Brook.  The other games had only slight connections to each other that felt more like product placement than anything that affected the plot.  In this one, you actually control the character from the Filmmaker and she spends a portion of this story investigating the characters from Shady Brook.  I think it's a good idea (the one step forward).  But on the one hand, there's no particular reason this nurse should be the character from the Filmmaker because her experiences in that story don't seem to influence her actions in this one whatsoever, and the stuff to do with Shady Brook has the unfortunate effect of diluting the well-crafted ending to that game. It now feels like the main character sacrificed himself just so that the girl could just die later by the same hands.  Pretty bleak moral there. But it seems that maybe it's all to set up a later game.  And perhaps my mind might change depending on what happens there.  Still, kind of bleak nonetheless. I talked about some things I didn't like but there are thing the writer's gotten a lot better at.  The characters except for the villains feel the most fleshed out.  Whether they are in the fantasy world or the hospital, they are intriguing, much like in Stonewall.  The art has improved a lot.  Maybe that's a two edged sword, because it has gotten good enough now that we might be tempted to compare it to games with better art still, whereas before we were likely to just overlook it.  But I like that the hospital and the fantasy world are in different styles, and I like the few animated scenes like the flyovers of the new areas when you reach them and for scenes that require a bit more action than slideshows allow. Finally, I like the way the fantasy story was constructed.  Even though it didn't feel like a real place (as it shouldn't considering it was a dream) I liked that the different chapters felt interconnected by the end.  I liked, for instance, discovering what had become of the scepter after the story had stopped caring about it.  It was very nicely put together. But yeah, I wouldn't really recommend it as a whole.  Despite it's mature content, it doesn't really have a point of view on all that that I could discern beyond terrible things happen to innocent people, so I'm not really sure I'd really suggest someone dwell on that by playing the game.  I might feel differently based on the sequels though.  It looks like maybe there's plans to have two different ones following each main character?  I'd be happy to see where it's all going, and then reconsider this.  Let's just hope these girls' story don't end like Kate Ekan's",6.3 hrs on record,N/A
76561197986997483,5,Stonewall Penitentiary,"Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"I enjoyed this escape room-style mystery game.  In comparison with the other games in the Storycentric Worlds series.  This one wasn't as ""fun"" as the previous one where you were exploring a theater, but it had something none of the previous ones had, which was a villain you could understand.  All the others were Good vs. Evil, which is just never interesting.  In particular I liked the little ARG bit that you get to do after the game is over which allows you to hear a little bit more about the killer from his own lips.  It was good and made sense.  I do wish the killer had had the chance to discuss these thoughts with the main character, however. The plot is nothing remotely original, but it is well-executed and the characters are interesting to learn about, especially the ones who survive longer and the protagonist.  The puzzles are all logical, but on the easy side (though I've seen worse in this type of game, definitely.)  I only got stuck once because of pixel hunting, but fortunately it was when I was confined to a single room with three screens. I think a fun idea would be to remake this game from the killer's perspective as a stealth game.  How do you constantly get all your murders set up with out running into any of the several people walking through and searching the same corridors you have to navigate.  :-P  I only say because after I finished the game, I was trying to figure out how was possible for the killer to be in front of the protagonist in certain scenes.",5.4 hrs on record																					(5.4 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197986997483,5,The Filmmaker - A Text Adventure,"Adventure, Casual, Indie",Recommended,"So, of these Storycentric Worlds games, the first one I played was Shady Brook, and I didn't recommend it.  I did like the game design, I suppose.  It was a nice way to keep the reader engaged and showed that you could have point-and-click adventure game-style puzzles in interactive novel, something I don't think I'd seen before.  However, the story just wasn't very interesting. I won't go into it more and rereview here, or anything.  But I was interested in seeing a more original story with the same engine.  I bought the pack, and the first one I tried was, Lifestream, which, if anything was worse than Shady Brook, and I was like, oh no, even though I've always reviewed every game I've finished,  maybe I shouldn't even review this, I don't want to come onto this designer's page and dis all of his projects.  Let's just say, it was not a good fit for the engine, it was less like an interactive novel and more like someone was describing an existing point-and-click adventure game to you.  But! I'd bought the whole pack now!  I might as well try the third one......and I'm very glad I did! This game was great.  It had a very unique setting and many puzzles throughout.  And although the puzzles weren't hard, by giving you access to so many of them at the same time, it did make you think a bit more about them.  Often the puzzle ends up being, do I think I have what I need to complete this puzzle yet?  Which works for me.  Also, I've always thought different worlds with a hub world was an artificial way of designing a game, here it just makes so much sense.  I really think anyone who thinks they might enjoy this should buy it, it's cheap enough even if you don't.  It's not like it gives you food for thought afterwards, like something like the Cat Lady does, but it's just unique and fun.  So, far (if i'd have played the games in the order they were made instead of 2,1,3) each game has been better than the last, and I hope that means Stonewall Penitentiary and Summit of the Wolf will be the best of all. (On a side note, in case the author of the game reads this.  Don't talk down to your audience.  you've put 17+ on these games, we don't need to have Roman numerals explained to us (as in this game), or the word 'homily' defined for us (as in Lifestream).  If we don't know, we have the internet.  You seem to want us to think of these games as novels.  I have never seen that kind of thing in a novel.)",4.6 hrs on record,N/A

(I just finished Chapter 1).  The first thing I will say is that this is much more beautiful than previous games in the series.  I always liked the lighting effects in them, but here the actual drawings for the main characters are much better done.  Also, although I'm sure this game is going to put me through a lot before the end, I have some idea that maybe this will be a more positive story than the other three.  I trust the cat a lot more than I did the old woman in the Cat Lady, for instance.  I feel like maybe I can do something to help this protagonist that I never could before.  I suppose the only negative so far is that the puzzles have all been perfunctory, but we'll see if that continues and we'll see how things go, but so far it's all gorgeous and wonderful (and creepy and messed up).",5.0 hrs on record																					(1.9 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197986997483,6,Shady Brook - A Dark Mystery Text Adventure,"Adventure, Casual, Indie, RPG",Recommended,"The plot of this is a little simple, although I suppose I liked the resolution.  What is interesting about it, is that it attempts to create a classic text adventure without requiring the player to do any typing.  It has kind of mixed results.  Perhaps one of the tantalizing things about text adventures is the player input could be ANYTHING.  This is unlike more modern adventure games where you are limited to INTERACT, USE ITEM, COMBINE ITEMS, and the like.  The text parser, on the other hand, can involve creativity.  One of my favorite moments in such game was in the final puzzle of Yahtzee Croshaw's Chzo mythos episode that had a text parser.  You had to type something you really didn't expect and when it crosses your mind--well, I got a real kick out of it.  Here, you end up with more of a Lucas Arts-style experience, where you never really feel like you can get stuck, because even if you don't understand why you should do something, you could always just combine objects until something lets you move forward.  (The pleasant exception to this is the couple of times where you have to solve a maze using riddles) However--it does kind of work here.  It's a bit nicer to read dialogue in this way than in the Lucas Arts-style games, and it feels like it has a brisker pace to me because you don't have to watch the same walking animations all the time.  I could see games in this style being really fun on the phone or tablet.  It's more interactive than a lot of interactive fiction that I've tried on those platforms which seem to be more along the lines of verbose Choose Your Own Adventures--often with some romance options. So, I guess, I would like to try another game of this style, just with a more surprising plot--I mean I've certainly seen movies with this exact plot several times, all the way to the black and white era.  (although again the very end of this game was nicely done). Also, on a side note, this story has really none of the feeling of Twin Peaks, I don't know why the store page name drops it.  There is practically no humor, and the little humor I did smile at I'm not sure was intentional, the characters aren't quirky, and nothing surreal ever happens. So, yeah, I guess i wouldn't recommend this, but I would be willing to try another game with this game engine.  It would just have to have a more creative storyline.",5.4 hrs on record,N/A

76561197986997483,6,The Past Within,"Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"There's another co-op puzzle series out there called We Were Here that has a pretty similar set up to this.  It feels a lot less polished than this and perhaps even incomplete, but it does understand how to make the idea a bit more challenging.  In The Past Within every puzzle in exactly the same.  One person finds a code, which is always right in front of their face, then relates it to the other person who then inserts it into the only place on their screen the code could possibly go.  then they repeat this 3 to 5 times (I suppose to prove that the person has actually done it and not just guessed?) and then maybe some little things happens like a jump scare or plot development and then the process repeats. The big problem is that you're never asked to figure out a puzzle together.  And, of course that there's only even one code and one entry station at a time so there's never any question about what you should do next.  There are escape room games that do this quite a bit better, and even in We Were Here, which was very similar, at least there was some difficulty in thinking about how to relate what you were looking at to your partner.  Here it's ""Z3X1Y2"" or ""bee, person, house"".  The one section where this game starts to come alive at all is in a section toward the end where you relate the codes under the threat of timer, only then do you feel that you and your partner are actually working together on the same thing. The story is a lot more obvious than in the Cube Escape games, and it doesn't appear to me to expand the universe in any way.  I guess if I were you, I'd skip this one.",1.6 hrs on record,N/A
76561197986997483,6,INMOST,"Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"It's interesting how film and even novels these days seem to become simpler and simpler and to have to spell everything out, while independent games seem to be where the bounds of storytelling is being pushed.  I'm thinking of things like The Cat Lady and Talos Principal (and even moreso its expansion) that leave with things to chew over.  This game provides you with three stories that seem unconnected at first and its only through the symbolism that you begin to see connections that become more plain at the end.  That is all good and it's also good that it's a pretty dark story in the end, if a little more complicated than it needs to be. What doesn't work so well is the gameplay itself.  You'll be working your gray matter way more on figuring out the story than on any of the puzzles in this puzzle platformer.  Additionally its irksome how slow all the characters move, and the knight's sections are just the worst of all.  I think the idea was that the girl's game is an adventure game, the adventurer's a platformer, and the knight's an action game, but there is zero skill involved in the knight's combat moves.  You just push the joystick right or sometimes left and mash the attack button.  And there are so many sections with him.  Every time the screen fades away from the adventurer portions, you dread how long you'll have to spend with the knight.  And it's not like the adventurer is all that inspired either, as I say it's all too easy.  The girl's portions are the best because they are the most focused on uncovering the narrative, but she moves the slowest of all, and that adds its own frustrations. So, yeah, compelling story, but poor gameplay.  I guess its up to you if you can put up with the one for the other.",3.0 hrs on record,N/A

You have to replay the first few screens over and over and over again looking for new ways to die.  That's basically what the puzzle is, you have to find ending in the game.  Most of them are ways to die, but there are a few others.  There are several different ways you can deal with a dragon, for instance.  I do kind of like it, and the enjoy the humor and slight changes in the world you start noticing as some things you do make permanent changes, but then you find a new ending screen, and it fades away, and fades back on that same start screen and you express a little sigh.",2.2 hrs on record																					(2.1 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197986997483,6,King Arthur - The Role-playing Wargame,"RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"I think this is one of the first games I bought on Steam, but I didn't review it at the time.  Back then I had kind of long load times that made me dread everytime I had to enter a new battle.  But now I'm trying it again with my much upgraded computer (only the chassis, keyboard and mouse of the original remain) and it's a much smoother experience.  There's so much to like about this game.  While the tactical do eventually get repetitive (how can they not), they are also varied with a lot of different battlefields that offer different obstacles.  Unlike other RTS of this sort, the battlefields have points of interest you must control to gain access to spells and bolster your troops morale.  Morale wins or loses the battle in this game, not decimating the opponent (although that certainly helps).  And that is an idea I quite like because it really adds another layer of tactical depth. But where the game really shines is in the campaign.  The base game comes with a story campaign that is very interesting with lots of flavor and text quests to go on.  Even in can be played through a number of times because you have a few different paths through it.  You can be good or evil, and you can be pagan or Christian.  I can't bring myself to play King Arthur as a bad guy, but it's interesting having to choose between the old gods or the new.  After you're done with that, the expansions offer two more campaigns that give you something of a Crusader Kings lite experience.  Now you're free to conquer the map or make friends however you'd like. It's hard to recommend this game highly enough.  Especially, since as popular as King Arthur is as a setting for games, they rarely seem to take it very seriously (the only exceptions I can think of being Infocom's Quest for Excalibur (which really adapts the Sword in the Stone) and Spirit of Excalibur (and presumably its sequel Vengeance of Excalibur, but I haven't played that.)) This is better than Spirit of Excalibur, though, because it is a working game, and that was something more like an experiment. As a side note, some people are leaving this game bad reviews because they are having glitches.  I wish they would say in their reviews what their computer specs are because my game is running perfectly.  I'm using Windows 10 with an Nvidia GTX 1070.",16.8 hrs on record,N/A

76561197986997483,7,"Gremlins, Inc.","Indie, Strategy",Recommended,"Gremlins Inc, is a board game with a Monopoly-like theme,  but perhaps it plays more like Talisman.  You are dealt a hand of cards from a common deck and use these to move around the gremlin city, earn resources, complete goals and attack your enemies. It has more strategy than some the games that inspired it because you aren't a slave to the roll of the dice for where you must land next.  You are instead a slave to which cards you draw since each card gives you a number of spaces you can move, between 1-6.  This allows you to plan ahead a bit so that you can play your cards in such a way as to avoid bad spaces.  I will say there's a bit of problem in that all players draw from the same deck.  I would prefer if it were set up more like a deck building game and each player started with their own crap deck they could improve by buying better cards (and making sure to maintain a mix of movement values between them.)  This would also help with the cards the combo with other cards, because with the deck being so big, it feels very unlikely that you'll see both of the cards that work together.  But the other way you could build your deck so that your cards work together. That is all beside the point.  Because the game is fun.

I like that being unable to move through eggs and other units adds a puzzle-like quality to the game which otherwise would be straight up tactics.  it's also interesting that many of the creatures seem to be underwater creatures, maybe this is taking place on a beach?  The store page suggests this is Chess evolved, I'm not sure about that.  Creatures take multiple hits to kill, and the spell system adds a random element that Chess seems to have intentionally avoided.

76561197986997483,7,Pinball FX3 - Balls of Glory Pinball,Simulation,Recommended,"I bought this pack for Archer pinball.  I like both that show and Bob's Burgers quite a bit.  American Dad is okay, but I loath Family Guy.  As far as the tables go, they don't feel great at telling a story like some of the Marvel, Star Wars, Bethesda, Alien tables do.  I feel like the reward for playing in these is just to get sound clips and references from the shows.  Many of which quickly become irksome by repetition even from the shows I do like.  Archer maybe comes across the best.  I don't really feel like I'm completing a spy mission, but you can get quite a lot of things to happen on the table which gives you some things to explore.  The other tables all just remind me of one another.  Everywhere you hit the ball is another ramp associated with another character from the shows.  I suppose of the three, Bob's Burgers is the closest to being ambitious.  In it, you are assembling hamburgers for the guests at Bob's restaurant.  But it doesn't really run with the theme.  Maybe it should have been like those time management cooking games, but you shoot your pinball from station to station.  Anyway if you shoot the same ramp enough times in any of these tables, something happens, maybe a multiball, and that's the games.  I guess if you really love Archer, his is not a bad table, the others, as I said before will annoy you with the repetitive voices.  I don't really recommend this pack.  There are much better offerings from Pinball FX3. One other thing I'd add is that the non-Archer tables in this pack are very similar in layout not only to each other but also to the Marvel Champions table, from the Women of Power pack.  It feels like Zen is running out of ideas?  Maybe that's why they switched to doing recreations of real pinball tables.  In any event, Champions is better than these three tables and A Force is better than Archer.  So, I'd recommend getting that pack instead of this one.",0.0 hrs on record,N/A
76561197986997483,7,Mike Dies,"Action, Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"I bought this because I got a kick out of the humor and weird characters in Psydra's other game, Dark Scavenger.  This is nothing at all like Dark Scavenger, not in terms of game play (obviously) nor in terms of humor or setting.  It is, however, a fun platformer with smooth controls and an interesting level layout. It is most similar to something like Super Meat Boy, but not as hard, and it doesn't feel as repetitive.  I never finished Super Meat Boy, however, I've managed to 100% this in 5 hours.  It has a story to carry you though, mostly this shows up in what I assume are intended to be dream sequences or hallucinations, which fiddle with the rules of the game, also with boss fights and collectibles.  The first two add some nice texture to the game.  However, the story itself I'm not so sold on.  I get the client and the rat like thing, but I don't have a clue what the angel, demon, or floating eye thing are doing in the game.  Also, just over all I'm not sure how this enormous labyrinth is supposed to be space station.  I'm reminded of the scene in Galaxy Quest where Sigourney Weaver's character complains that some writer put a series of crushers in a hallway, and it's bad writing and she refuses to do it.  But I still do give the game props for having the main character be LGBT without feeling like it has to make much of a big deal about it. But overall I recommend this for the gameplay.  It's really fun exploring the maze-like layout, looking for secrets and new exits, always feeling like you have no clue where you are and yet never feeling like you don't know the way forward.

76561197986997483,7,The Hex,Indie,Recommended,"If not for the wonderful demo of Inscryption I might never have played this game.  I didn't like Pony Island much.  I felt it was too similar to several other video games of the time, and not a particularly good example.  But then during the Steam demo fest thing this year, I tried Inscryption and was delighted and when I looked up what else the designer had made, I discovered this--and it was on a pretty good sale, so I pulled the trigger. It is much better than Pony Island.  In some ways, it's appropriate that I played it during the demo fest because it feels a bit a like demo fest itself. As you move from controlling character to character in the inn, you play flash backs of them in their games before the arrived at the inn, and this gives you a chance to play a lot of short games.  I will say that all of them are a little different from the games that inspired them, which is nice because it helps the game still feel new, however they are also all a bit too easy.  Without challenge it maybe feels a bit like a walking simulator more than a game, even though there is way more to do than hold down the W key.  I'm not really sure why the designer chose to do this.  Similarly, the main game that connects the smaller experiences takes the guise of an adventure game, but puzzles throughout are just as easy as the various arcade and strategy challenges.  In fact, there is another level of the game where it glitches and gives you cheats or help, and this help arrives as the puzzles show up, so you're not even allowed to try to solve them when they appear. A very strange design choice in a game that wants to make you feel like you're peeling back the outer layers and breaking the rules to discover what is underneath. I remember back when puzzle games wanted to be exceptionally difficult.  That they'd want to force you to give or go to forums for clues at how to get through them. If you didn't cheat to complete Monty Python's Complete Waste of Time (for instance), you really felt proud of yourself, and yet those games probably wouldn't have as much thought put into the ending as this one does. Well, I think the best experience would be to both make the player work for it and reward him/her.  Nowadays story telling has improved and the challenge decrease.  We can only have one or the other.  I think maybe I blame Valve.  I remember reading an article about Portal 2, where they said they never wanted the player to feel stuck.  If the play testers so much as started heading down a wrong path, they would add some lights or something to make sure the player would never take a wrong step.  I don't know why this is desirable, if I wanted to be so led around by the nose, I'd watch a movie or read a book But putting my thoughts on challenge in a puzzle game to one side.  I certainly recommend this game.  It's really just a delightful toy box, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it from beginning to end. I suppose I have one other small complaint, and that is that the achievements seem fun to try to complete, however because the game autosaves rather than uses save files, my only option is to play the game again all the way from the beginning.

Champions is the more immediately likable of the two.  It kind of reminds me of Bob's Burger's if you've played that table.  It feels like every where you shoot is a ramp.  The fights are easy to get into and feel unique from one another. I didn't like A-Force at all at first, but it started to grow on me once I started to use table nudges when the ball found its way over to the left outlanes.  I think the table is designed so that you are intended to nudge it when it's over there, and I would say once I started doing it, I'm more likely to lose my ball on the table when it goes straight down the middle.  It can be hard to keep control of your ball on the table.  I find the ball goes left and right almost as much as it goes up and down.  But because it's fairly easy to keep the ball away from the wrong outlane (with nudges), it doesn't feel too unfair.  After spending some time with it, I found I liked this table more than Champions.  The story really came across, and I liked that it was more a complicated story to tell with pinball. Neither of these tables do anything totally unique, they are not as good as Fear Itself or Infinity Gauntlet or Moon Knight as far as Marvel tables go, but I can't imagine you won't enjoy your time with them.",0.0 hrs on record,N/A

Well, it's been a LONG time since Zen studios made an original table, and I've been anxious to play something new.  So, I decided to buy this pack.  I had played the Arabian Nights table in real life and loved it, and I'd also played a different company's recreation of the table on steam.  Zen has, frankly, done a much better job than that earlier attempt.  The assets are all in much higher resolution, for one thing and it's easier to see what you're looking at and where you should be hitting your ball next.  It's such a great table with a bunch of different quests to complete, and what's very nice about it is that, for a game that's based on a physical table, it manages to convey those stories while you're playing. Go Home Gophers is a golf themed table, and the two concepts go together like chocolate and peanut butter.  You really should read the rules to this one, so you can know how to get your ball in the hole and how to get a good score, since it is is not as obvious what you are doing as it is in the Arabian Nights table, but once you learn it's a ton of fun. The third table is Cirque Voltaire.  I hadn't heard of this table before.  It's got a lot going on, which I like.  There's a trapeze artist who will lock your ball, balloons to pop, a ringmaster to defeat.  I have no idea what the story is, but I sure like visiting all the attractions These are three great games, and while I only I have this williams pack and the first one, I can say there's a lot more to do here.

Basically how it works, is you can use their approval to do a variety of useful things, pass special laws or instantly colonize a new system for example, however, that uses up their approval and your planets slow down to a crawl.  The only way to earn approval back is by going out and fighting (or completing faction quests).  What a fun idea.  I haven't seen anything so unique to do with approval ratings in any other game. Also, added are behemoths.  These are giant late game ships that also can do some things at home, depending on which one you get.  I like that they are multifunction, but they are expensive and take a lot of research too.  Not really certain they are ultimately worth it.  They don't break the game or anything, but like pirate diplomacy in the vaulters expansion, they just don't add much to an amazing game.

76561197986997483,8,ENDLESS™ Space 2 - Vaulters,Strategy,Recommended,"There was so much to do and learn in the base game, it took me forever to pick up the expansions for this game.  Over and over again, I would play to a certain point and the restart when I discovered some other mechanic I didn't know about.  This was the first expansion I bought, and also the first one that was released.  I think the Vaulters were kind of an odd race to tie to an expansion because they are a bit easier to play than some of the races that came with the base game.  They have a unique way of colonizing new systems that streamlines the process.  To me this almost makes them a good pick for new players, even if it's not the way things go with most of the other races. Additionally, this expansion adds pirate diplomacy.  I have kind of mixed feelings about it.  In the base game I feel like pressure from the pirates forced you to think about warfare a bit earlier and prepared you for meeting with your more bellicose adversaries, however pirate diplomacy largely seems to work to let you put that off, which is dangerous more than useful.  Furthermore, other options with the pirates, such as paying them to attack other players, doesn't have a big effect and, honestly, may help them out, by forcing them to make more powerful ships which can then be used to attack you.  I don't know.  Although I don't like Civ VII as much as this game, I think what they did with barbarians (having them slowly progress to becoming a minor civilization if they aren't wiped out) was a bit more interesting than this. Overall, I would recommend this.  I don't think pirate diplomacy is bad enough to hurt the game, and I do think the Vaulters are fun.

This comes up especially if you also have some of the additional quests DLC's that make you travel to far flung corners of the map to complete them.  I suppose maybe they added those quests specifically to make this faction more competitive since I've seen people say they are under powered in multiplayer.  (I couldn't say because I only play multiplayer cooperatively) But the best part of this expansions is the Altar of Auriga and Pearls. Pearls are a new resource that shows up in winter and can be sacrificed at the Altar of Auriga for a variety of bonuses.  Some of the bonuses are nice little boosts but some feel so necessary you almost look forward to winter.

I do like most of them, but I'm not sure i'd notice if they went away.  Mostly this adds Legendary buildings, which are like Wonders from CIv, but I think they are are more powerful and there are also fewer of them.  I find I almost always get them before the AI.  I like that they count as a district but don't require a pop to build them allowing you to expand the borders of your city a bit more rapidly.  Also, like districts, they can also be upgraded by being surrounded.  That's a lot of fun. There are also legendary deeds.  These are basically competitive quests.  The rewards are a nice bonus but not enough that I would every change my tactics to try and achieve one.  If I happen to get one while I do what I would be doing otherwise, that's fine. Midway in quality between these two things is the Guardians.  They are powerful late game units, maybe a bit like Behemoths in Endless Space 2.  They are expensive to build and must be researched first.  Is it worth it?  Maybe...  I think the best thing about them is that they look cool.

At least in this it's not an actual chore, but it's strange that it has so little effect on the game unless you're actively pursuing it.  Plus it takes a hero to do it and heroes are so expensive, that is not what I want to use mine for.  Pillage is fine as a wartime option, but definitely not worth the price of the expansion.

I love having something for you armies to do when you aren't in the middle of a war and would otherwise just be pressing end turn (not that this game has nearly so much of that as a certain other massively popular 4X strategy game.)

76561197986997483,9,ENDLESS™ Legend - Symbiosis,"RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"Both the mykara and the Urkans are great.  For me the Urkans take the place of what would be a minor civilization in other similar games.  They pop up on the map during the midgame in unclaimed territories and claim them for themselves.  There are basically two ways to deal with them, you can bribe them or attack.  if you manage to gain control over them, you get a super powerful unit you can move around.  I think it adds a lot of interest, and gives something for your troops to do if you don't want to be fighting the other players. The mykara are also interesting.  I'm not so sure about their quest line since I didn't get very far into it before being on a different path to winning, but I enjoy playing with one beefy city, but still being able to claim resources outside your border.  I imagine they are easier to play on larger maps with few players and more unclaimed land, since you can't claim resources under your opponents' area of control.  I had a bunch of other nations right on top of me in my game, but fortunately none of them were too war hungry. I'm a bit boggled by the number of poor reviews on this expansion, even moreso than I was with the last Endless Space expansion.

And I liked choosing to follow this group of people or that group of people around and eavesdrop on them.  What it reminds me of most is actually a text adventure, Suspect, by Infocom (and I think they had other detective games as well)  But to solve it, you had to play it many times as well, and the NPC's in the game would be in different places at the same times, so you could only follow up on one thing at a time.  This is obviously a lot more advanced than that, but I do feel like there's still a way to go in the genre.  Particularly, the end of this game isn't very satisfying, and I think it's because even at the end you're still pulled one way or the other, and even following on what should be the main mystery feels like tying up a loose end. (I have an additional complaint about one of the resolutions but I don't want to talk about it because it would be a spoiler.)  So, yeah.  The game works when it works and it doesn't when it doesn't, but I definitely think it's worth your time if you like detective novels.

I like seeing the different paintings all together and interacting and animated, too.  The premise of the game is fun and probably attracts a few people to buy it.  The actual gameplay is a bit abbreviated, however.  None of the puzzle require much thought and as fascinating as all the characters have been drawn, I would personally like to learn more about them and get to interact with them more.  There's a book by Umberto Eco called Baudolino that I suppose I had similar feelings about.  The first half of that was a very accurate portrayal of the middle ages, then in the last part the character journeys to the East, but instead of finding China he finds all the weird creatures from the marginalia of scribe's books.  That's such a great idea, but unfortunately, he didn't do much with them and then went home again.  As I say I feel a bit similarly about this.

When reviewers act like they do with this game (""Just play it!  I can't tell you why!!!"")  That's as good as telling you why.  But it's not like what it is is hidden anyway, even on the store page. Surprises aside, it is mostly two games, one is an endless runner where you click the left button to jump and the right button to shoot.  The other is a game that tries to appear like a coding game, but isn't.  a cursor progresses to the bottom of the screen and you put instructions in its path to move left or right or warp.  Well, I don't really care for the endless runner game, and the other is too simple to really be a logic puzzle game, and its method to get harder is just to make you move the instructions faster.  Of more interest is exploring the devil's computer in between the levels, and I think a lot more could have been done with this.  Personally, I didn't find much of interest here.  and shouldn't there be?  Two games that I thought were more interesting that involved involved exploring a strange operating system interspersed with puzzles include Sorry, James, and Macdows 95, which I would recommend over this.

Well, either you immediately recognize what the clues are of and put in the answer, or you just type the clues into google and maybe you read a wikipedia article and then type in the answer.  Perhaps the game gets harder?  But I get the idea that harder would just be more obscure trivia--not things that I would call puzzles, which would require another step once you get the trivia.  I mean to say, using the facts in some clever way to get the answer, not just inputting them directly. The story isn't very engaging either, perhaps because of the way it's presented with you reading some woman's dream journal and looking at documents from the psychiatric facility she was being treated at.

It's nice it has a bisexual main character, and the acting is okay.  That's about as far as I'll go. There really isn't any game here to speak of.  The closest thing to a puzzle in the whole game is telling your pet rat to get your billfold under the couch, and my gosh if that isn't pathetic.  There are also a couple of guess the password puzzles for breaking into computers, but those are so simple too, and a puzzle at the end of the game involving an alien circuit board that is not on the level of anything from Myst or the Dig. So, maybe it's an interactive movie?  Those are quite popular these days with titles like the Walking Dead and Life is Strange.  Well, those usually involve some choices you have to make.  There is only one choice here and it's at the very end of the game to decide which of two equally unsatisfying and short endings you get.  The lack of choice is a problem overall.  You have to do everything and get every single movie clip unlocked in order to move on.  this includes doing wrong things like trying to open a bolted shut toolbox with a screw driver that will not open it.  If you don't do this, the new chapter will not trigger.  Very tedious.  Really the game is click on every single hotspot, watch the associated movies, click on every single hotspot again and again until you've made the rounds enough times for the story to progress.  It's ridiculous.  Why is it a game instead of a movie? There might have been some room for your choices to affect the game as far as which of three love interests you wind up with.  but here to you have to pursue each one as far as the game will let you, and can't choose to focus on one, and the game has predetermined which one you will end up with. So, yeah, really this ought to have been a budget movie, if it needed to be anything.  As it is, the interactivity is really a hindrance to getting involved in the story because it's just a stumbling block of ""where haven't I clicked yet today?""  that ruins any hope of any suspense.  In general, I would say I find horror games scarier than horror movies because you are forced to open that door where something might jump out at you, while in movies when it gets scary you can disassociate from it a bit.   Here the game does the disassociation for you by stopping things every 2 to 3 minutes. If you want to play an FMV game, I recommend Gabriel Knight 2, the best in the genre and one of the best adventure games period.  Also, there are some newer FMV games, too.  There's one here on steam called Yoomurjak's Ring, that I'm about half way through,and has an intriguing story and sort of virtual reality feeling since it allows you to walk around the streets of a real city as though you're in google maps street view.

I think part of the problem with this game compared to its predecessor is the pacing.  Here all the detective/investigation work is in the first half of the game and all the puzzles are in the last half.  Because of this you get a bit bored of each before they are done.  Additionally, I really wish this Steam version had an option for Hungarian voice with English subtitles.  It only has English dubbing, and while a couple of the actors are okay, the majority are terrible.  It's also a bit disappointing that, although it bills itself as a full motion video game, this is only once in a while.  Mostly you look at still images of the actors. Overall, the game is unique and you learn a bit about Hungarian scientists, and their contributions in physics, which is very nice.  I might have heard, at some point, the Hungarians found the first evidence of the neutrino--for instance--but this put it in context and made me care about it.  The puzzles are all logical and solvable without a walkthrough, though a couple of things take quite a bit of trial and error since they don't work the way you'd like them to.  What I don't really care for is all the walking around required to solve them.  And quite often you see just what you are supposed to do and where to go to do it, but even if you go to the proper place, the game won't let you do the thing until you've talked to another person in a different room who tells you to do the thing you already know. So, yes, this is a very weak recommendation.

If you find a chest, you might not be able to open because you also have to find a key which is also hidden around the world.  So whenever you find a key or two then you have to go back and refind the chests you couldn't pick up at the time.  Also many of the quests involve you talking to the character you received the quest from again, well it's pretty tedious to walk through the quite large town area looking for the character again.  Everything is just repeated. Also, playing on normal difficulty the combat is a bit simple, so I'd recommend you start on a harder one.  On this note, I question the experience point system.  There's an area near the beginning of the game where you have to do this flying attack thing to get a chest far above the level, it is difficult to pull off and if you empty the air of enemies you must leave the screen and try again.  Well, in a normal platforming game without experience points, trying the same thing over until you get it is fine, but here while I was trying and failing I probably gained half a dozen levels and each level gives you an enormous stats boost.

That has always been the case with Batman, but this interactive story has finally solved the problem by giving Batman personal and convincing connections to his villains.  Bruce Wayne and Harvey are best friends.  Bruce Wayne and Oswald Cobblepot knew each other as peers as children and Bruce's parents were the cause of the Cobblepots' decline.  It's all very interesting and makes you invested in the characters and their fates to a greater extent than in any other Batman medium.

You might want to look up information about other people's playthroughs if you get to the end and don't feel this is the case), but mostly the choices affect how other characters feel about you and about how you feel about the other characters.  Because of this, the vast majority of the subplots feel extremely satisfying when they come to their conclusions.  That is a bit less the case as far the main plot goes.  It has a very cool twist and everything you learn about the mastermind is interesting, but in its case that hardly matters when the final scene is merely a drawn out fight with hardly anything interesting said.  To an extent that scene turns out to be more about Batman and Alfred's relationship than Batman and the villains (going by the sequel to this game) and that's a bit disappointing. But don't let that small quibble distract you from the wonderful storylines involving Selina, Harvey, and Oswald, Gordon, Alfred (though that doesn't get its payoff til the next game), and Bruce himself.   That's the vast majority of the game, and even the majority of the main plot is great too. I love it.  Best Batman so far.  It's among the more mature depictions of Batman, and not in ways that you feel are only there to earn it in the label.

76561197986997483,11,Supraland,"Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG",Recommended,"Supraland is wonderful. It feels a bit like mario 64 with Talos Principle like puzzles.  The art style is very attractive and complements the story nicely.  And a few of the power ups are unique, although one I think could have had more inventiveness in its use.  You get this beam that lets you connect two objects and pull them together with the right click. Despite the mechanic being included, I don't think you ever one are called on to use it.  Instead you just use it to pull yourself to objects like a grappling hook.  It's a bit odd that the functionality is there and you are even told about it in the tutorial.  But overall you are asked to often think about using and combining the tools at your disposal in unique ways, particularly in the final boss battle (which puts Portal to shame). The game is very big, surprisingly big, almost too big because you keep finding yourself further and further away from the puzzle you are trying to solve and it's a lot time to get back to it.  It has jump pads to go from place to place quickly, but without an ingame map you're never very sure what the fastest route is.  While I'm making these small complaints, I'll say that the largest is the combat.  I mean, it's fine but it happens so often.  I wish things would maybe stay dead until you left an area and came back.  (and they could still stay dead forever one you get the various power ups that close their lairs). Also, those power ups could come sooner.  It's very tedious to be always pausing to kill things. But the jumping around and finding things and figuring out puzzles is a lot of fun.  I'm 84% done with the game and never needed a walkthrough, and yet I felt some parts took me quite a while to figure out.  Finding the final chests will take some time that will nicely extend the length of the game.  But here a map would be useful again.  How many chests are left in each area would be nice, even if it was somewhat limited use because it seems so many of these last ones involve dropping down on them from the mountains dividing the areas.",34.2 hrs on record																					(29.6 hrs at review time),N/A

76561197986997483,11,Candle,"Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"This has some frustrating aspects.  The story isn't very interesting and is strangely violent.  Most games of this sort have the protagonist incapacitate his enemies, but this one he just goes around on a killing rampage.  But the other main problem with the story is how it has the slowest cutscenes I've ever been forced to sit through, and not just the cut scenes but also the dialogue in general.  This is odd and worth explaining.  When you talk to somebody, first you must watch a sort of silent movie with rudimentary drawings showing you what the person is saying.  This is very slow with every stage of it staying on screen far longer than needs to be, but as though that isn't enough, then the narrator slowly explains what you just saw.  I think maybe the concept was to only have the pictures but maybe in playtesting people had trouble decyphering them.  But having both was definitely not a good idea.  Other than that the story is rescue the princess (shaman in this case) with the bad guy sort of based on the Man Who Would Be King, I suppose, but it doesn't really make sense in this case since here he was invented by some shamans to be king, rather than someone from a more civilized world.  I don't really get what would make him (it?) drunk with power.  Why does it have any desires other than what the shamans imbued it with? Outside of the plot, the game is generally good.  I suppose it's side scrolling adventure game in the footsteps of something like Dizzy.  (I'd say not as good, but it is probably better since you can pick up more than one inventory item at a time.)  But there are some failings here too.  Including blind jumps that would normally kill you being required to proceed, or having a false wall you can walk through.  In a Metroidvania game, these things would hide bonuses like extra missiles, and then it might be fun to find them.  Here, they were twice the cause for me to go to a walkthrough, and in one of those cases, I inadvertently saw the solution to a puzzle I hadn't put a lot of thought into yet.  there are a myriad of smaller problems like timing for interacting with enemies not being quite what you expect, or way too much back and forthing between the caves and the blacksmith in the forest level.  This is a game with some fast travel platforms but I don't think they are ever in useful places. But I suppose I do sort of recommend it.  It's not as though there's too much competition in this genre and if you want to play a platform adventure game with the focus on puzzles rather than platforming, you'll probably enjoy yourself more than be frustrated.  Also while the story is tedious, the art is very pleasing.",11.3 hrs on record,N/A

I think the creators of the game should make a couple of more complicated ones available with the free version to let people know if they like this sort of game or not. However there are tons of grid by other players which is awesome and why I would recommend this game.  As for the controls and presentation, I like them generally, but what I really don't like is that for levels that have a grid that isn't a multiple of ten, in, at least the few initial levels, they don't include the extra rows and columns and put zero over them.  That makes it very difficult to see quickly how many spaces you have to count.  They also grey out number before you put an X locking them in which makes it harder to see what's done and what isn't, and they add up how many tiles you've blackened in when holding down the mouse, which is a cool feature but it only counts the new squares you've put down not the entire set of squares, so it's of dubious use.

This is similar to how the tabletop card game, Dominion, works.  And makes for much more strategic gameplay than hoping the card you need will be drawn.  Eventually the game does get old, because once you master it, it becomes something of a numbers game against the computer components.  But there is at least a dozen hours before that.

76561197986997483,12,Heroes of Might & Magic V: Tribes of the East,Strategy,Recommended,"Heroes of Might and Magic V was a bit of a tough sell for me when it came out.  I was very invested in the worlds of the later Might and Magic and HOMM games, and HOMM IV (while also a game that took a while to love) eventually won me over by having the strongest writing in the series.  But here HOMM V comes along and throws all the world building out the window and replaces the somewhat zany sci-fi aspects of the plot with a humorless pure fantasy world.  The plot is even worse than simply being bland, because the dialogue is terribly translated into English, and most of the main characters are extremely unlikeable. But here's the thing, if you don't play it for the plot, HOMM V is the strongest entry in the series.  It's AI isn't great, but it's sure better than absence of AI the New World Computing games had.  Also, there are just a ton of good ideas in the level design.  Nearly every mission of the campaign feels unique and if you're playing on the highest difficulty almost have a puzzle aspect as to how to complete them.  I also love the complicated new skill system (though to get the most out of it you have to download the in-game skill wheel mod by Xazardous available on some Heroes websites).  You can make your heroes very specialized and it's fun to unlock game altering skills that change your gameplay style rather than just slowing beefing up your hero, as in previous Heroes games (HOMM IV excepted).  Also, while the tactical combat gets old, as it always does in these games, this one has the best yet with each unit having very particular associated skills, that give them all a very unique memorable feeling.  (In years since, King's Bounty has improved upon this angle even more, however) If you can over look the plot, this is probably the best game in the Heroes series.  Make sure to download the skill wheel mod and dive into the fan manual (included in the game folder) to really get the most out of it. One more thing to add, you can find files online allowing you to play the original and Hammers of Fate Campaigns within Tribes of the East.  I recommend this as it has some nice upgrades like caravans which the base game doesn't have.

Really just four decks you can slightly improve over time.  But what is nice is that those four decks are all very unique each with mechanics that only they use.  I'm not really sure about the F2P portions.  It seems to be possible to upgrade your decks relatively quickly compared to other free to play titles, however I don't like playing with other humans if they have cards I don't have.  I think the game should limit players in matches to the cards shared between both players and give a short deck adjustment time before the match begins so you can replace cards that become unavailable.

76561197986997483,12,Yesterday Origins,Adventure,Recommended,"This game is much better than its predecessor which I still reviewed positively.  The increased length was a big help for evening out the tone.  I particularly liked the different time periods and background art.  Pauline is thankfully much less useless this time around (although still not particularly likeable.  I think maybe it's the harsh manner the voice actress has with her lines.)  And whereas the previous game had a very rushed and disappointing ending, this game's ending has as much detail as the lead up and an ironic tone. Negatively, although the puzzles are harder, they still won't ever make you feel clever for figuring them out.  In fact often the puzzle is less about figuring out what to do than figuring out how to communicate with the game engine you know what to do.  The game engine is a bit odd with levels of thinking about things and zooming in and scanning and using things and conversing with people and looking at people up close, but it doesn't utilize all these options as effectively as, say, some of the Sherlock Holmes games do.  But it's okay, it's just cumbersome.  The other negative is when the humor sometimes involves pop culture references which the main character wouldn't understand.  I don't believe for a second that he plays Crusader Kings, for instance.  Of less importance there appears to be some sort of bug with what I think are achievements.  Something sometimes causes a bunch of red error text to appear on the screen and the only way to get rid of it is to restart the game.  I think maybe it shows up when I'm supposed to have gotten achievements and didn't, because I notice that there are a few achievements I didn't get that I should have.  It's very minor, it only came out a few times. But overall a great adventure game.  If you like adventure games, I'm sure you'll enjoy yourself here.",9.1 hrs on record,N/A

The plot is very intriguing but I would like to see it develop a bit more.  I guess there is a prequel (which is a good idea, but I hope there will be a sequel too).  The villain is interesting and unusual.  Besides the length and simple puzzles, the main weaknesses are the fact that the girl, while having an interesting connection to the main character, is completely useless and adds nothing to the story, and also that the game has kind of a odd sense of humor that is a bit jarring because it's uncomfortable but not really funny.  That might in part due to the game being a translation, but characters like the lascivious hotel clerk and the american tourists add little to story and makes me wonder at the wisdom of having them stand out so much.

76561197986997483,12,Gigachess,"Casual, Indie, Strategy",Recommended,"This is a very good puzzle game with three different modes of play.  In the primary mode which sort of mixes turn based strategy and puzzles, you have a few powerful chess pieces which can all be moved on your turn and must defend against an assault of pawns which move toward you at the end of the round.  This mode is beefed up with some spells you can cast, as well as a neat idea where if one of your pieces is in a threatened space and another of your pieces kills the piece threatening it, you get a bonus where one of the fast pawns get downgraded to a normal pawn.  This mode also has an endless variety.  While interesting, this is my least favorite of the three varieties. In the Puzzle mode, you have a particular setup and must defeat all of the pawns under a certain number of turns.  I think this is the most interesting of the modes because you are encouraged to think economically, and you know right away whether you've done well or not since there is a best answer. In the third and most different mode, you have one knight who must visit every single space on a variety of unusual chess boards, these boards have a few squares with pictures of other chess pieces and if your knight lands on one of them you turn into that piece for a single turn.  I think this is very intriguing, but also it is very difficult to plan out your whole tour in advance, so I tend to use a lot of trial and error and taking back moves in it.  Maybe I will get better at this mode the more I play it, and like it better. There is a big negative for me, and that is the pixel graphics.  I find it very hard to tell at a glance which chess piece the art represents.  I often have to mouse over them.  This is exacerbated by them turning gray after they've been used in a round.  Even seeing at a glance whether a piece is mine or one of the pawns isn't immediate, and makes taking in the whole board difficult.  I don't really know what can be done about this besides maybe making a sequel in a higher resolution. But it's worth your time and money.

I was enchanted with the characters and world and humor.  It felt like I was able to interact with a computer animated movie.  I didn't get very far in it for a couple of reasons.  Mostly because it was too hard for me at that age.  I made it out to the stockyards without any trouble, but I hated to leave any Mudonkans behind in the factory and it was difficult to find all the secret areas when some were in pits which normally you would die if you fell into. I have come back to the game as an adult with New 'n' Tasty, and I have to say all the stuff I loved about it as a kid is still there.  The charming protagonist and now that it is in 3D he fits into the world even better and the whole thing feels a bit like playing with real toys.  I finally finished the game and freed every single slave.  It seems like the only secret areas that were unfairly hidden were in the first area.  And maybe I've just improved but the platforming in the first area seems to be by far the hardest, especially in the first area's secret levels.  That's pretty weird as far as difficulty curve goes.  And I guess that's my only real complaint with the game.  It's okay for the game to get too hard to finish, but especially with something so appealing to kids, I'm not so sure it should start out so hard.  The game is made a lot easier by allowing save states, however.  I'm for this, since it allows less proficient players to experience the entire story, and yet you can still still play it on hard and have close to the original experience if you are a masochist. I realize that this game really just updated from the original version, but the story is rather simplistic and amateurishly told through noninteractive cutscenes.  Since this game came out we've had games improve upon this to better meld story and gameplay.  I hear that a new game in series is being released after several years, and I hope the designers have taken note of how storytelling has progressed in games since they started (not that even at the start of videogames there weren't ones that mingled story and gameplay more artistically.

Mostly the game is 75 easy puzzles in 3 categories, one where you must not repeat your path, one where you must rotate squares so their sides match, and the most interesting one, one where you must move multiple objects at once so they all end up in the same grid square (a better version of this puzzle is in the classic puzzle game, Heaven and Earth, if you're willing to fiddle with DOSBox.) It's possible there's more to the game that I missed, but I'm tired of saying things to people and getting same responses.  I have all the achievements so I suppose it is done.

If you place on arrows you get more fish (dice) to place.  You're limited in how my moves you can make in a turn (I think 8), and carnivores will come and attack your dice which you want to have happen because defeating them with pairs or straights or the current ""team up"" ability gets you the most points.  You have a limited number of rounds to make quite a predetermined number of points based on your rank.   There are four or five different sets of dice you can play with, which start out easy (3 sided or 6 sided with all the numbers) and get more complicated (one set has odd numbers on one kind of dice and even on another.  I hope you're keeping balanced between the two types).  The complicated sets are compensated by have more special faces on the dice (usually the 1 or the 6) which do useful things when placed.

I probably won't finish Crusader Kings II because I don't think I will ever get tired of it.  It has some problems.  Starting a new campaign--even after you know the ins and outs of the gameplay--is a daunting task.  There are a lot of people in your court and in neighboring courts for you to get to know, and it can take forever before you even unpause the game.  Perhaps worse is the amount of time where you just wait for things to happen, worried that if you speed up the game you will have missed something important.  Furthermore, going to war takes up a lot of game time and fighting is the least well developed aspect of the game.

In all other games, I'm concerned with winning, with conquering.  Here my goals are much less grand and much more complex:  How to be a good ruler and maybe achieve explore some new game systems along the way. On a side note, much to do has been made over Paradox's DLC policies.  First of all most of the DLC is cosmetic and not remotely necessary to buy.  Most of the DLC labeled ""expansion"" is worth buying.  Some of those are terribly overpriced, I think.  But there are websites that help you decide which are necessary.  I think anything that makes game wide changes and deepens the roleplaying aspects of the game should be bought to have the full experience (especially Way of Life, Conclave, and Holy Fury), while you can hold off on DLC that focuses on specific regions of the map or opens up new time periods in which to play.

Finally there are some overarching puzzles besides the little puzzle boxes themselves.  And I really like the multiple ending idea too.  Most of the puzzles are a bit on the easy side, though perhaps not as bad as in previous entries, but the fun is how the things you do to physically manipulate the game objects make you feel more like what you're playing with could be real. How much games cost really has little to do with their quality.  This is less than a year old and on sale for $1.50.  I think other games just cram in content to maximize their playtime and how much they can charge for it.  Perhaps there are some games that can get by with that like some grand strategy games like Crusader Kings or Endless Space, but more and more I find I much prefer something that doesn't overstay its welcome like this or Gorogoa or the Telltale Adventure games.",6.6 hrs on record																					(5.8 hrs at review time),N/A

Mainly that individual battles that don't necessarily matter a lot consume a lot of your time, because they've added tactical combat.  And secondly, that because your hero continues from map to map, you have to spend a ton of time on each (inordinately large map) mopping up all the stray experience points before going onto the next map. I can't really recommend this slowed up gameplay, but I sure hope more Disciples games are made that return to the series roots.",12.2 hrs on record																					(8.1 hrs at review time),N/A

(but after a few hours that gets tiring too, especially with all the repetitive side missions that seem to be designed simply to take you from one side of the city to the other again to prove it's all there.)  Also, storywise, neither of these games have much going on and that's why it gets old fast if you're coming into this game after having played the first one.

76561197986997483,14,Pinball FX3 - Star Wars™ Pinball: Balance of the Force,Simulation,Recommended,"This pack has one of the Pinball FX's best tables, Starfighter Assault.  It also has Darth Vader that, although being a perfectly fine table, probably won't be anybody's favorite.  And it has a pretty much perfect adaptation of Return of the Jedi, in that it's just as disappointing as the film. Starfighter Assault is really just a lot of fun.  The table just comes alive with the dog fights taking place right over your playfield.  it's really worth reading a guide on this one to know how what you are doing influences the battles.  It also has a lot of fun minigames with different types of scrolling shooters for you to participate in. Darth Vader has a unique, almost horizontal table layout.  The hurry up modes are interesting.  In that they are often a bit more than just hit the same lane again.  They can become a bit hectic, however, as you can unintentionally start more than one hurry up at the same time.  I wish starting one would lock the others from progressing until you are done with it instead of making you choose between them.  The story missions are all very thematic.  The table's a bit on the easy side.  All of the shots are very easy to hit.  What is a bit difficult is getting the ball into a resting position on the right flipper as most ramps and things seem to empty onto the left flipper.  When the ball does make it over to the right, it's usually going at a fair clip.  That slight issue is not the only reason I think that maybe this won't be people's favorite table, I think it's more to do with the table art.  Starfighter Assault is dark but all the ramps and things seem unique.  Even though all the ramps of Darth Vader are very distinct from a game play perspective, they all are associated with nothing more than the same sort of white runway lights and just looking at it one area of the board appears much like another. The third table is Return of the Jedi.  In someways, I feel like they split the movie of Return of the Jedi into two tables.  The first portion with Jabba the Hutt being better represented in the Boba Fett table in a different pack.  that leaves the battle for the moon of endor on this table.  It wasn't very interesting in the film, and it's not very interesting here.  i was watching the film once with some friends.  At one point, one friend complained about the Ewoks, and then another pointed out that if not for the Ewoks nothing would be going on at all.  And that's true.  The interesting part of that battle was probably the Ewoks setting up traps for the storm troopers.  But the Ewoks are barely represented on this table.  And perhaps if they had been there would be something interesting to write about this table.",0.0 hrs on record,N/A
76561197986997483,14,Pinball FX3 - Star Wars™ Pinball,Simulation,Recommended,"This pack has one great, one good, and one problematic table, but fortunately no out and out misses.  Clone Wars is my second favorite Star Wars table (after Starfighter Assault), and this a bit shocking to me because I find the cartoon show its based on unimaginably dull.  But the table's a lot of fun.  I like the different loops the ball makes, and it has a fun (and hard) series of mini tables above the board which represents a training for a clone.  The missions on it are nice as well, as they all feel very unique from one another.  i particularly like the one where you have to load refugees onto a space shuttle and then avoid being shot down. Empire Strikes Back has an interesting table layout, although I get a bit bored waiting for the ball to bop around in the upper playingfield especially if you're in a time mode.  But I think that probably the main draw is the missions playing through the movie. What you do is perhaps not as well themed as in some other tables (more often than not it's just hit the flashing lane) but so much of the movie is represented and a lot of it plays out for you on the dot matrix and with 3D models on the playing field.  (It is, however the least fun of the three tables and probably not worth the price of admission alone.) Boba Fett.  So this is an incredibly creative table that is also incredibly difficult.  I have played it quite a bit and still don't fully understand the whip (which is the table's version of kickbacks)  it seems like sometimes Boba Fett swings his whip and most of the time he doesn't.  if it weren't so easy to lose your ball out the outlanes, I think I might like this table a lot.  Basically there are two mission trees.  One from the Emperor and one from Boba Fett.  They each give you bounties you can collect, and you have a variety of ways to collect them, including shooting the flashing lanes or collecting rockets and shooting them at the targets.  I think if a person got good at this table it would be very rewarding, but I'm not sure it's possible for me.",0.0 hrs on record,N/A
76561197986997483,14,Pinball FX3 - Williams™ Pinball: Volume 1,Simulation,Recommended,"The big draw here is Medieval Madness.  One of the most popular and most fun physical pinball tables that just can't be beat, but this is digital edition and how does it compare to other digital pinball tables?  Is there enough to do? Yes, definitely.  Zen Studios has a few different tables that have a similar theme, particularly Epic Quest kind feels like the same idea with a Monty Python-esque sense of humor, and Excalibur in everything else.  Epic Quest is a bit simple, but and interesting experiment that they later revisited and developed in the Bethesda tables.  Although Excalibur has a more serious theme, it is more of a direct rip off Medieval and it has a lot to do.  A lot more than Medieval Madness.  But it's a much more difficult table.  Many of the important shots are very difficult to make.  And I did get pretty good at it having beat nearly of the main side knight quests and main quests in separate games (excepting the quests to do with the mini-playing field which is beyond me.)  But it's too difficult to be fun, and the way kickbacks work on the table is terribly frustrating.  Medieval Madness on the other hand, just hits the sweet spot.  All of the shots just seem to make sense.  They all feel like what they represent.  The moat, the castle, the catapult.  Even the ramp to save the princess feels like a tower, requiring quite a strong hit to get your ball up to the top without it falling back down.  And it's such joy to have gotten to the final wizard mode when I never could have done so with quarters.  I highly recommend this pack for this table.  The other two, however... The Getaway has kind of an interesting history, which is worth reading about.  Apparently, it's based on a real car chase the designer of the game engaged in with the police.  On the other hand, it's a really simple table, and it's not long until you've seen its few tricks. The Junkyard is a bit more complicated, but kinda bizarre.  The main interest, I suppose is the wrecking yard in the middle of the table.  You can hit a wrecking ball with your ball there to wreck a bunch of cars around the edges, or try to get past the wrecking ball to get other bonuses.  This requires a pretty hard hit and results in the complete loss of control over your ball, so you'll probably be wanting to avoid this main feature of the table (unlike in Medieval Madness which rewards you for engaging with its toys).    Interestingly, Zen ""borrowed"" on this idea for their Secrets of the Deep table, which improved upon it by having the table with the wrecking ball be divided from the rest of the playfield with its own flippers.  This vastly decreased the penalty associated with hitting the wrecking ball. Around the edges of the wrecking yard, is actually where you'll be spending most of your time in the Junkyard, these ramps and sink progress a sort of story.  apparently you've been locked in a junk yard overnight, the only way to escape is to construct a rocket out of cast off items and blast your way into space.  one cool idea of the idea is combining the different pieces of junk you find creates inventions which can then unlock new modes through their use.  For instance if you get the hair dryer and the toaster, you can collect piece of toast from a sink hole and then first at the dog house.  Then you get to play a little video mode where you try and hit the dog with the pieces of toast fired from the toast gun you made.  I mean there is definitely some creativity here.  It's just too bad the layout of the table isn't better. In summation, Mediveal Madness is classic and even if it loses something by not being a physical table, it still stands up against more complicated digital tables.  The Getaway and Junkyard are certainly not without interest, but you probably won't be playing and replaying them.",0.0 hrs on record,N/A

76561197986997483,15,Tales of Nebezem RPG: Red Peril,"Adventure, Indie, RPG",Recommended,"So, some time ago I posted a review of a partial playthrough of Red Peril and gave it a good review because I liked the Tales of Nebezem series and at that time the game didn't have any reviews yet.  I wasn't able to complete the game at that time but I went back and restarted and finished it over the last couple of days.  I was 4 hours into it on my first review, Steam says I have 18 hours now.  I must say there was not nearly enough plot to justify 14 hours, which is why I have changed my review from positive to negative. I believe the author put a lot of work into this game particularly into balancing, since it keeps about the same difficulty throughout.  Also the in battle skills are all generally interesting.  But you'd have to really love this kind of jrpg turn based combat to enjoy this game.  Because I as I already said there is hardly any plot at all, and this is surprising because that was a really strong point about Elemental Link that made up for the relative lack of difficult puzzles. The writing itself isn't bad.  The characters have almost too much personality.  But their characters never develop anywhere.  I think maybe this is due to them not really interacting with the plot and having an effect on it.  They follow the trail of the arsonist, they learn their identity and motivation, they defeat the arsonist.  Who they are as characters never comes into it, not to affect the plot or to be affected by the plot.  Their having personality only exists to allow them to provide commentary.  (which is itself nice since there are 8 possible characters, though only 4 will be seen in the game).  This set up reminds me of Seiken Densetsu (Secret of Mana) 3.  There you chose a main character and two sidekicks from a choice of--I think--6 total characters.  But in that game, the main character provided the main storyline for the game and each sidekick contributed a substantial sidequest to the experience.  I think in many ways it was the most replayable RPG ever because all those combinations were really different experiences.  This game could have use a similar system were different events in the world triggered for different characters, as opposed to the same events just triggering different dialogue from them. I've kept my original review below, because most of what I say there is still true, and it addresses the plot and battle system in more depth.  I still love the Nebezem world and will buy the next title, but I do kind of wish I'd better spent my time than put 14 (or 18 total) hours in here. I usually wait to finish a game before I give it a review, but I thought I'd make an exception since this is a long game and it doesn't have any reviews yet. I will update my review once I've finished the game. Tales of Nebezem is a great series of adventure games on Kongregate. This is the second of two premium games in the series. The first, Elemental Link, was a story driven adventure game which strangely had less of an emphasis on puzzles than the Kongregate games, but it still served up an interesting story to which this is a close sequel. You will be interested in the plot of this game if you've played Elemental Link. So far the game is about one of the gray people from the end of the previous game who works as a guardsman and whose house was burned down by an unknown arsonist. You quickly find out that the same thing has happened to other people and you take up the culprit's trail. Interestingly. for both the main character and the first two companions you are given a choice between two options. I'm not sure how much difference this makes to the overall plot, but it makes a lot of difference to the dialogue. I think that probably in the long it will make the whole game replayable at least one time. The gnomes are back, and this time they are particularly interested in what's making wildlife attack everyone who comes near which brings us to what makes this game different from the others in the series: the addition of combat. The combat is turn based without positioning and reminds me of earlier Final Fantasy titles. I'm not a big fan of this style of combat and I wouldn't be playing this game if I wasn't invested in the series. It just feels like you do the same thing over and over again in every fight. However, the magic system is interesting with different schools of magic working better against different enemies. If your character isn't magic, you have skills that you can use like spells but that require you to be attacked by the enemy so taunt is more useful in this game than in any other similar game I've played. I think if you like this sort of combat this game should be different enough to appeal to you. I just long for a world where grind was a thing of the past. I haven't seen a lot of puzzles yet, which is disappointing, but I have hopes they are coming. The main reason to play this game so seems to be the story, and the interesting characters inhabiting the world. I sure hope the robot from the most recent of the Kongregate games shows up soon. :)",18.1 hrs on record,N/A

Your upgrades continue from game to game.  This isn't the first time Zen Studios has done this, and in some respects I like the previous attempt (Epic Quest) better.  There is certainly more to do here.  But I just prefer the silliness of that early game better. I'm not very good at the Fallout table for some reason.  And I feel like there must be interesting things to happen here, but I haven't seen them yet....  most annoying is continually hitting the store when i don't have enough bottle caps to buy anything.  couldn't they make it so the ball would just immediately drop out of the saucer if that happened? maybe I'll give it some more time in future and force myself to figure it out, but I'd rather just have fun with Doom.",0.0 hrs on record,N/A

But I don't care so much for it.  The table is very busy and it's hard to feel like you're doing something specific rather than hitting the ball randomly and seeing what happens next.  Also it's the first and so far only table that pushes the limits of my graphics card, not enough to affect the game but every once in a while I notice it losing a frame or two.  So, I don't play it much. Hercules is a lot better.  It feels a lot like it could have been a Marvel superhero table, but I'm happy it isn't.

They are all a bit simple, but they do have some fun layouts. The Blade one is probably the most interesting I kinda feel like it's a first attempt at what would become the Moon Knight table (but it's not as fun).  It has an RPG flavor with things to collect and vampires to kill. Spiderman and Wolverine are very basic tables, but well done.  Wolverine has a spinner that would be fun to use on a real table and a fun bit where you can drop your ball on Hand Ninja heads.  Spiderman has a two level playing field and it's fun to move between the two levels.  Mysterio reminds of the sorts of things that can happen on the stellar Infinity War table in another pack. And then there's Iron Man.  This table is fine in that it doesn't feel unfair, like some of the ones I hate like Avengers.  but nothing interesting happens.  It has 12 missions split between Tony Stark missions and Iron Man missions, which is a good idea.  and you can tell whether you are doing Tony Stark missions or Iron Man missions, so the idea does come across.

The rest are all good, however.  Infinity Gauntlet has really fun challenges that make massive changes to the table as you collect each stone.  Fear Itself has a lot of fun boss fights.

76561197986997483,15,ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,Recommended,"Endless Space 2 continues with the asymmetrical gameplay of Endless Legend to create a game with a great deal more replayability than Civilization, the game I think it is most similar to.  Every race has very different mechanics for things like how they colonize new worlds or how they use resources, and it results in feeling like you get 8 games in one.  Even better than Endless Legend, these different mechanics don't force you so much into a particular playstyle because once you've started you can do a lot tinkering with the race's government and techs to fit the play style you need for your situation.  This is why it is a better game than Civilization, in my opinion.  Because you have such control over what your alien race is and how they deal with the universe both among themselves and in interacting with the unknown. It possibly gets over complicated at time.  If you're just pressing end turn waiting for something to be built or a tech to be researched, you're probably missing out on a great deal of choice.  Your civilization includes your starting race and alien refugees who have settled on your worlds.  Shuffling the populations around between planets and later systems, and encouraging some to reproduce more rapidly is just some of the ways you can what your civilization is and how efficient it is.  But by the late game you have a quite a lot of worlds to manage and it can start to being a micromanagement chore. Diplomacy was quite simple when the game came out, but it has become a lot more complex recently.  I do think the AI doesn't know so well, what's in its best interest here.  It seems to undervalue systems and overvalue techs.  But it's a lot of fun wheeling and dealing and putting pressure and demanding tribute from lesser civilations, eventually to consume them through politics or conquest.  (I generally prefer the former.) The tech tree is much improved from the former title in the series.  But it doesn't seem to tell you all the information you'd like to know, especially in the military portion of the tree.  What will this gun actually mean to the fire power of my ships relative to what they are currently at, can they equip them, how much does it cost, are all questions that seem out of reach.  similarly, it would be nice to highlight techs that you can use easily.  such as, show me only techs that have to do with resources I have. Economy is interesting but another area that is poorly explained.  You can make a lot of money (dust in the game) by buying and selling luxury resources on the market and the game does tend to alert you when this is a good idea.  you can also set up trade routes which take a lot of time and resources and are a bit of a gamble because your trade ships can be easily destroyed often before they've paid for themselves.  I suppose it is more like commerce from the old days in that respect.  But here too, how much each trade you get earns for each trip is never told.  So, when you see the price increase for each new one go up, you have a hard deciding whether it is worth it.  Just in general this lack of specifics in places where there's no reason for it not to be is a problem. Which brings me to the final problem  there really needs to be an ingame almanac or manual.  There is an out of game manual, but it doesn't have specifics of how the systems work, either, and it is out of date, since quite a lot has been added to the game since launch.  I highly recommend Endless Space 2, but as a new player, you may not like it.  The game is all about preparation.  You have to have put some work into every aspect of managing your civilization before it you run into problems, so you can solve them before they arise, and it's nearly impossible to do that when some times you don't even know that the mechanics are in place to solve them in the first place.  I remember even just conducting a siege involved knowing about ground troops and upgrading them and man power and all kinds of info, that's hidden away on subscreens. You may even think you've research the proper tech, like tanks, but there's they are going to do no good for you if you don't know where to go to add the tanks to your armies or how to upgrade them and what would be a good proportion of tanks to infantry to bombers by seeing the positives and negatives of each one.  So, you will lose and have to restart the game and start planning earlier the next time.  and this will keep happening because after learning about sieges there will be something else like politics that screws you in the next game.

I liked the way the story was told with a minimum of dialogue, it's not quite the no dialogue whatsoever of Another World, but it keeps the pace up.  I think the puzzles were fairly good (particularly the ones to to turn off the generators), and although they mostly don't resemble the sort of situational puzzles in Another World (except maybe for the ones involving the bounty hunter), I very much enjoy exploring ruins and fooling around with machinery. Negatively, some their ideas didn't work so well with their engine.  For instance, there was a programming puzzle where you couldn't see the entire area at one time, so you had to basically put a single new command at a time see where the robot ended up and then add one more command and run the robot again.  The engine similarly tripped them up for a desert chase toward the end, where in a normal game you'd easily change lanes by hitting a direction once, in this one you had to very precisely find your lane with continuous movement and it was a real chore. The platforming is a bit difficult, particularly in a lengthy and questionably necessary sequence at the very end, but overall the game was a blast.

It turns out it is an escape room (forest) game similar to the Cube Escape series, which is a series I like quite a lot. The story here was very interesting, and self contained (unlike Cube Escape which seems to still be working on a resolution). I quite liked that the areas and characters seemed unrelated while you were playing but were eventually connected in an unorthodox manner.  The best part of the game involved the brook, although one of the puzzles to complete that portion was an out of the box thinking sort of puzzle that I thought didn't belong in the game.  I ended up resorting to the ingame hints for it (and only it) and rolled my eyes at the solution.  It took me out things and everything else works so well atmospherically. I liked the map and the encyclopedia a lot, but I didn't care for the movement so much.  I wish it had been a clearer where the paths were so you didn't have to keep watching the arrows to show up in the letterbox portion of the screen. Overall, it feels like an early project from a designer who is going places.  I would definitely recommend it.",3.1 hrs on record,N/A

Sometimes you'll put in the correct answer to a puzzle and the game won't recognize it.  This happened to me 4 times.  the first time I moved on after a while and did other things.  I just thought my answer must have require more nuance I wasn't seeing.  The second time it was awful.  I spent maybe 2 hour checking everywhere high and low for things I might have missed relating to the puzzle.  finally I turned off the computer frustrated.  the next day I turned it on started searching again, but for fun put what I thought might be answer in again and it worked.  So, if you think you've done something correctly and it's not recognizing save yourself some trouble and restart the game. On top of that, my save game corrupted.  I am in the epilogue. I've played for 17.3 hours according to steam.  but I can't log into my save game.  the title screen says I've played for 0.00 hours.

Maybe I shouldn't because other people may be less forgiving than me.  But it's so very much what I want out of a game.  There were two other big Myst games that came out recently Obduction which was too simple and had the most punishing loading screens of all time (especially during puzzles that involved teleporting!) and Quern which was just too hard for me being a color blind person.  I don't know why games refuse to give options for that (also I found the art of that one boring).  But this one is wonderful.

The only memorable puzzles in the whole game are the small set of puzzles involving searching an archive.  Those were good.  The rest is far too simple to test your gray matter.  If you ever get stuck, it's simply because you couldn't pick one brown thing out of the background.  The characters were good for this kind of humorous sci-fi.

It's one of only a few comedy games where the humor consistently lands.  And i liked the plot twists.  I didn't figure out who the Stranger was but it made sense. The only thing I suppose I didn't care for was that the game gave you the idea that you could side with Jack, but didn't really follow through.  I don't care too much for false choices.  Also I wish there had been a few puzzles along the way.  Sometimes the game opens up and lets you control a character.  But it's only to push the analog stick forward.  In those situations it would have been nice for a few puzzles to show up.  Sometimes adventure games make the mistake of feeling like they always need puzzles, and that's why they end up with stupid things like the inflatable duck puzzle in The Longest Journey or the cat-moustache puzzle in Gabriel Knight 3.

The overarching story is nothing we haven't seen before, however it takes until the end of the game to learn how each of the characters are integrated into the story, and so the mystery still works.  Some of the time you are put in control of a character who is forced to make an action that you might not want to do.  That can be particularly frustrating in this sort of game where you are putting your brain to use to solve problems for them.  I can think of several solutions which I don't find unethical, but I can't try those things.  In the worst of these cases, the game goes to great lengths to try and explain the character's motivation after the fact by providing some flashback scenes.  I still wasn't totally convinced.  Obviously this is very difficult to explain without giving spoilers.  I don't know.  The puzzles are great.  The story has some problems that maybe wouldn't be as bad had this been a novel or a film rather than a game that puts you in control.  Finally, I don't like the 'the end, or is it?' style finale.  There's a lot going on in these characters' lives at the end.  We don't really need a cliffhanger to feel invested in a possible sequel.  Actually, putting the cliffhanger in there limits the possibilities in a sequel, because these characters could have dealt with ANYTHING in a sequel now they have to deal with what amounts to loose ends.",10.9 hrs on record,N/A

I quite liked the art of the characters, but I wish some story had been told among them.    It's very short.  You will probably enjoy yourself 3 hours and never think of the game again if you get it on sale.  I was stumped by one puzzle towards the end of the game that refenced something several scenes back and I didn't remember (because I'd had supper in the meantime), and so I used the clever ingame hint system.  It's worth missing a puzzle to use it once.  I liked the idea.  I also liked that the game didn't feel the need to walk you through a tutorial on how to use it or any of the rest of the functions.  The magnifying glass I liked less well.  And the way going toward the top of the screen would open the inventory--but sometimes you had to click on things up there was very annoying.

Also, the dialogue is annoying and annoyingly delivered with a scroll that appears too slowly.  If it's going to be delivered that slowly, it should be voice acted, otherwise let us read at our own pace.  Meanwhile, the puzzles are really simple or fetch quests that require you to traipse back and forth over the same screens.  I like that the art, and worlds seem like something a little girl could come up with, and perhaps that was the idea with the dialogue as well, but people really need to say more interesting things to keep my interest as an adult.

76561197986997483,18,Pinball FX3,Simulation,Recommended,"I would love to be all hipster and say some other game, like Zaccaria Pinball is the best pinball game you can play on the computer, but it isn't true. The others hardly give this one competition.  Pinball Arcade used a bad engine and their assest are a bit low resolution.  Zaccaria has a lot of fun ways to make the game interesting like campaign modes, but they need it because their tables are so boring.  Pinball FX3 blasts the others out of the water.  The physics of the balls might be a bit more predictable than in real life, but honestly that makes for a better game.  The tables are inventive and elaborate compelling you to come back again and again to unlock more missions and modes. And Pinball FX 3 is a huge improvement over 2 which had crappy bloom all over the tables, now the games have much more attractive dynamic lighting.  It also adds tournaments which is as close as you can get to playing with your friends. Unfortunately, although the upgrade to FX3 kept almost all of your tables (excepting the good Plants Vs. Zombies, the forgettable Ms Splosion Man, the STELLAR football table (please bring it back)), Steam does not recognize me as owning all the tables.  So I can't leave individual reviews of a lot of them.  Those that I can, I will but for the others I will add the reviews here as I write them. Sorcerer's Lair: This table comes free with the download!  And it's one of the very best tables out there.  It reminds me a bit of 3D Ultra Creep Night if that were a much better game.  It has a lot of very distinct missions with very clear rules.  It's also the only table I have beat so far.  I completed all the modes and successfully completed the Wizard mode.  The only thing I haven't done is successfully finished the mission with the gears or started whatever happens when you light Staircase. In the game you navigate a haunted house and starting different missions have you doing things like play hide and go seek with a ghost or find your way through twisty hallways in the cellar.  One thing that makes this table a bit on the easier side, is that extra balls are not hard to get, and failing a mode still progresses you toward the final confrontation.   (Completing a mode successfully gives you Obsidian (which you can also get other ways) which in turn give you multipliers during the Wizard mode (I think).) Sorcerer's Lair really shows off the ingenuity of the designers and I highly recommend it.  Also it is free, so what are you waiting for?  Download it. Medieval Pack: This is one of the packs in which I own all the tables, but it doesn't show up in Steam as though I do.  It includes three tables of three difficulties. Epic Quest: This is a great introductory table.  The goals of the table are very obvious and the shots are easy to make.  It's a great table if you want to improve your accuracy. In the game, you find a monster to hunt in one of three places and then you must fight it by hitting (mostly) the Sword and Shield ramps and the Smash target.  If you dont' make a hit in time, the monster attacks you.  Each monster you defeat nets you a trophy, ""loot"", and allows you to lock a ball in the Princess Wheel.  After three balls in the Princess Wheel you start a multiball with the rewards from the Princess Wheel (including Jackpots and Extra ball) lit up on the table.  After (I think) 15 trophies, you must defeat the final boss to play the Wizard mode multiball.  I've never made it, but mostly from fatigue.  It's a long time to the boss, and all of the monsters play out the same way, but increase in difficulty. Loot is a bit interesting.  You find weapons and armor which you get to keep even between games.  Then you sell what you were previously wearing (or the new thing if it's not as good) for points.  You get to keep the loot between games, which is cool.  You also keep your level, which actually makes monsters harder and makes them worth more points.  it's a nice way to keep the game challenging as you get better at it. There are other interesting things like a few other modes (bats and skeletons) and healing potions and magic spells, which you collect by shooting the orbit.  The spells are difficult to cast in battle, but quickly defeat the monster and net more a lot of points.  The further you are in the game the more spells each moster in immune to.  I believe (but am not sure) that the final boss is immune to all spells. I would highly recommend this table to newcomers because it is the best table to practice on.  But for people who are good at the game it's probably worth passing as it won't take them long to see all it has to offer.  Charming animations and sense of humor, however. Castle Storm: I will add this review later, but it is an average difficulty table with a lot things to do, like Sorcerer's Lair.  I'd recommend it, but that being said for some reason it doesn't call to me as much as some of the others. Excalibur: One of the very worst tables in my opinion, and I've played a lot of it because I really like the theme.  The only worse tables are Tesla and the car racing one.  I will explain why it is bad.  It's a lot of little that add up together to make it not fun.  Firstly, your ball loves to go down the outlanes.  Zen Studios thinks they have mitigated this by making the table's version of kickbacks (lancers) very easy to get.  In fact they are probably the easiest kickbacks to get in any table.  But they are on a timer and it's very easy to not notice that that timer has run out.  So you're constantly checking them and stopping what you are doing to restart them only to have your ball go down the outlane when you haven't noticed it.  Ugh. And it gets worse, because like the Telsa table, EVERYTHING starts over with a new ball.  And getting anything done takes a ton of successive hits.  For instance, to complete the Siege, you must first have the ball roll over the catapult (a lane next to an outlane) and  then shoot a particular ramp (and it's a ramp directly next to another that is slightly easier to hit).  And this moves your siege enging a bit closer to the castle.  Then you have to wait until your ball happens to roll over the catapult again (not in your control) and not out the out lane.  And you have to do this over and over again, like ten times, and then your ball rolls down the outlane and your lancers just turned off without a chance for you to restart their timer and you lose your ball and then you must start the whole siege over again from the beginning because it resets. I don't recommend this table at all, and so I don't recommend this pack for veterans but i do recommend it for newcomers and intermediates for the very nice Epic Quest and Castle Storm tables. Sci-fi Pack: This is another pack which I have but doesn't show up in Steam.  It includes 2 of my favorite tables, Mars and Paranormal, as well as Earth Defense. I will write the review of Earth Defense later as I haven't explored it as much as I should. Mars: Mars is one of the best atmospheric tables Zen Studios has made.  I was a bit disappointed with the Alien tables because of their lack of atmosphere, but Mars proves that Zen studios is capable of delivering the terrible wonder of the unknown. The table starts empty, devoid of life, of interest.  But everything you do unearths Mars's secrets and adds more ramps and gadgets to the table.  A satellite, a robotic spider, a pyramid, wings for your shuttle.  It all comes to life in the most pleasing of ways.  The missions are generally clear, but a lot of the discovery is hidden away until you unlock.  I can't highly recommend this table enough. Paranormal: This table is fun just because there's a lot of things to do and targets to hit, even without starting the missions. I would say more about it, but apparently there's a character limit.  I guess I just can't review these things......",126.8 hrs on record																					(39.6 hrs at review time),N/A

They are some of my favorite games.  This one has the best graphics yet.  Amazing attention to detail.  You really feel like you're there.  The voice acting is not as good as Crimes and Punishments, though.  I can't think why they changed the voice actors for Holmes and Watson.  The new Holmes is fine (although I have a fondness for the orginal) but I can't stand the new Watson.  And the voice actress for Kate is gratingly bad.  I also don't care for decreasing the ages of Holmes and Watson since clearly this game comes after the previous installments.  The storyline functions very much as a capstone for the detective as he deals with problems he created as a young man.  So why is he illustrated as a young man? The stories are good.  I particularly like how the individual cases are related thematically to the main case.  It fills out that case more, which is necessary because it is bizarrely the briefest of the stories.  And yet you're always thinking about it.  The smaller cases are all very good, except for a Study in Green, which I give a mixed review to.  It had a lot of fun things to do as far as minigames and such, but I found the resolution to be bizarre and unlikely. Speaking of the minigames they are great.  A lot of ingenuity there and much better than previous games in the series.  I would like it if the detective portion of the game were harder.  Even if it were impossibly hard.  The basic idea of this and the last one is that you can possibly finger the wrong suspect, but since you always find all of the clues, you are nearly guaranteed to come up with the correct option.  It would be nice if it were possible to over look something.  Perhaps if you leave an area without finding everything, things will change by the time you go back or maybe following up one lead might keep you from following up on another.  Things to explore in future installments. I still love the moral decisions they are the best part.  In the case with the accident it was very difficult for me.  A lot of people had died because of the man's actions, and by putting you in the middle of the carnage the game really manipulated your feelings.

The premises of the short stories are a mixed bag, but what is great about it is that they are logical and well acted.  And the best part is that after each you can choose to absolve (or partially absolve) the perpetrator of the crime, and this actually gives you quite a lot to think about.  Why does the state have to get involved in every dispute?  Sometimes the courts add more injustice to a situation.  Perhaps we should be willing to look away in certain circumstances and mind our own business.  The most interesting one for me was the last one because the game tells you how many other people decided the same way you did, and only 17% of people decided the way I did, and I honestly can't see the point of view of the majority.

I'd definitely recommend playing them first if you're interested in this one.  They will tell you more about this game than any review will. This game is mostly fetch quests with some puzzles too.  They are wrapped together in a nice story, that is perhaps tied up too quickly at the end.  It's nice that it has a point of view, although it was perhaps too easy to convince the warring tribes to stop fighting after so many had been killed.  That part could have been more detailed.

You don't have to do any of that in that computer game and can just focus on trying different card combinations to see what the strategies are. I think it's pretty good this way.  And I like how the computer game's artwork has visualized things.  It's still not one of my favorite board games, I suppose, but there are a lot of things I like about it.

76561197986997483,19,"Sorry, James","Adventure, Casual, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Recommended,"A lot of the puzzles in this game have multiple solutions, unlike things like Sudoku.  That sort of forces you to solve them with a little trial and error at a certain point about midway through solving them.  I suppose that's okay.  It makes them different from what you're used to seeing.  The game has an achievement for solving the puzzles without making any wrong choices.  I think that would be interesting to explore a bit more in a game where you run into multiple paths in puzzles that are not easily resolved with forethought, but unfortunately there is an element that require you to put in a square to see what connections it might make and then you can rotate it.  Sometimes they make two connections at right angles, sometimes two across from each other, sometimes three.  If there's anyway to predict, I don't know it.  And their existence ruins the attempt at getting perfects, and I generally don't like them regardless because I like to be able to see everything at once. Besides that the puzzles get repetitve quickly and there aren't that many of them.  So, if you want to get this as a puzzle game, I suppose I'd recommend waiting for a refinement of the ideas in a later game by the developers, assuming they make one. This is a bit beta. And then there's the story......  The chat logs are generally boring.  I'm not really sure why I would be decoding them for my boss unless maybe the company was hacked by the person in the chats and this is a post-mortem.  Other people online have more interesting theories but I didn't really put it together and I think it's just because the chats were poorly written with lots of typos.  Maybe that was for authenticity, but that's kind of an annoying detail if it is, and part of why it doesn't work as well as it should is that English isn't the creators' first language.  So you're more likely to assume typos and awkward wording are due to translation rather than being there to make you wonder about the nature of who is speaking.  Regardless, the problem is more that the logs just never really talked about anything worth thinking about, and a lot of them seemed like padding.  I ended up skimming them just to get to the puzzles.  I think they need to dole the information out more regularly and have climactic reveals towards the end of each chapter. There are two hacking ""puzzles"" where you have to guess passwords.  I like that they require you to go outside the game.  Although I cheated on the second one and looked it up in the forum.  I think that was okay.  I didn't really care for where it turned out to be hidden.  These and some other things such as what happens when you finish the game, show a lot of thought went into the product.  And in theory I like mysteries that sometimes aren't solved.  But here I'm not sure I ever found out what the mystery is let alone solving it, which really kept me from interacting with it.  I do look forward to the developers next game, but I hope they get more of a sense of story structure by then. I know this is a middling review, but it's really worth experiencing, even if some of it is frustrating.  I hope the game gets some press.",6.3 hrs on record,N/A

The puzzles are pretty simple for an adventure but they switch up the action enough to keep you entertained while they tell the story which is the real point. About 6-7 hours of gameplay.  You can replay levels to find collectibles you may have missed.  Finding the collectibles usually gives you some snippets of facts about them.  There are also some facts about the war available for every level, making this a nice educational game for older kids who aren't prone to nightmares.  i really like that.

I rebought it here because you could get the Smitemaster selection holds for much cheaper on sale than they are on the Caravel website.  I mention this because it's been long enough that I don't remember Gunthro perfectly. Gunthro is probably the best pick if you haven't played DROD before, but it is probably too easy otherwise.  It is a better pick  than the original DROD game, King Dugan's dungeon, because that has waaaay too many repetitive levels.  Gunthro also has more story, but it's not a particularly interesting story. DROD sort of reminds me of older roguelike games in that every time you move all the monsters move in a predictable pattern.  But the skill in solving it is different because both you and the monsters all die with one hit.  The game is mostly about learning how the different monsters move so that you can trap them and not get trapped by them.  Most of the levels feel a bit like mazes, but there are other elements as well. DROD allows you to create your own levels and download those made by other people from Caravel's forum (for some reason there is a review here that says you need a subscription for that, you do not).   But there is enough content in the offical holds that I haven't explored that much. In comparision to other puzzle games, I would say this isn't as difficult or as charming as Fish Fillets 2 and the levels don't have nearly the variety of Enigma (which is free).  Talos Principle, Heaven and Earth, the Fool's Errand, Toki Tori 1&2, and MAYBE the Witness, I would also rank above it, but that still puts DROD in the top 10 puzzle games I've played.

76561197986997483,20,FEZ,Indie,Recommended,"Fez is a pretty good puzzle platformer. At the point of writing this review, I've gotten all but 1 golden cube and about half of the anti-cubes.  The best parts of the game was solving the tetromino puzzle and number puzzle.  I'm not really sure what to do to solve the language puzzle.  The others were well clued and solvable by taking some screenshots.  I think maybe the language puzzle will just involve solving some of the longer statements as cryptograms and replacing the symbols with letters, but I'm not so keen to do that now, since that has never been a kind of puzzle I've found very enjoyable, so I may come back to finish the game later and I may not. Besides the puzzles (which so far I'd say have been of medium difficulty), what is most fun about the game is that the levels are optical illusions as you spin the camera.  The actual platforming isn't as fun because it involves a lot of climbing which your character isn't very swift at, and that ties in with what I particularly dislike about the game.  I quite like backtracking in games like super metroid, because there when you do it your character is much more upgraded and revisting the earlier levels to solve puzzles is a breeze.  Here it is just as difficult as it was the first time.  And that's rather tedious.  It feels like all the rooms I have left to complete are miles away from one another.  There are warp gates but they work in a convuluted manner and it's not really obvious what the fastest way to a room that isn't gold might be.  I wish I could just select the room I wanted to go to in the map, but instead I must trog my way there resolving old puzzles and tricky platforming sections, and waiting at each doorway to find out if it's the one I want or not.  The puzzles are the best part of the game, but I'm not sure I want to do the platforming to see the last few. even if I don't end up completing the game 100% because of this, I would still recommend it highly.  it's fun to figure things out without instructions and it's a joy to see some of the trippy optical illusions.",9.9 hrs on record																					(9.2 hrs at review time),N/A

However if they call you on it and the monster IS real, they lose their turn.

76561197986997483,20,SHENZHEN I/O,"Indie, Simulation",Recommended,"I've always been a bit disappointed by Zachtronics games because they feel more like home work than puzzles.  I really like puzzle games, my favorites are Enigma, Fish Fillets 2, Toki Tori 1 and 2, and Talos Principle.  Something about figuring out the solution in those games gives you an Aha! moment that make you feel clever in a way Zachtronic games do not. Zachtronic games are going through the steps to get to the end result, I have played deep into all of them and they just get longer and more complicated, but they never seem to require you to figure anything out, which would give you that Aha! moment. They do have a nice moment at the end where you are watching your completed thing and see how it functions just the way you'd imagined.  It's an almost artistic sense of movement, and maybe the choices you make in the game are artistic rather than logical.  In creating the sandwich maker for this particular game, I made it extremely inefficient, but made sure every step and loop still had a purpose.  I think my code might actually make a person smile who had played the game, but is that the game?  I've played hours hoping it would get more difficult on its own, not that I would make it more difficult.  Each level just takes longer.  And at this point I'm thinking, why don't I just code my own programs and then at least I would have something when I was done with all this work. Also, these are a lot of the same feelings I'd had after playing TIS-100 and I might have stopped buying these things then, but I was partly attracted back by people celebrating the solitaire mini game in this game, but it is no good.  I don't think the designer really understands what makes a solitaire game good.  It is just much too easy.  and it is possible to lose by random chance.  (i don't object to the latter in solitaire at all, but in comparison to free cell, which is almost the same game, you can't lose by random chance AND it is more difficult.) The best part of the game is the little news snippets about tech problems in the near future, like self driving cars being stuck in a loop.  They are quite clever.

The new combat system was difficult for me to get the feel of at first.  it's much harder to block in this game than in the first one because if you have pressed attack before you pressed defend, your defend will not override it.  Essentially, you must wait until your attack animation is completed before you press your next button. I think it's good that it's different, because there was only ever skill required in the boss fights in the original game.  But it does have the effect of making the combat seem slow. I am surprised at how much I like this series.  The generic fantasy setting wouldn't appeal to me at all from a distance but once I'm actually playing it reminds me more of Lone Wolf or Conan than it does of Lord of the Rings, which is something to be thankful for, and often there is some inspiration in the creature designs.  My favorite has to be the mages from the first game with their spellbooks open and mounted to their armor.  Also, unlocking cards is so fun.

In Spectromancer, you got all the cards you could possibly play right at the beginning of the game, and so you could proceed along a longer term strategy.  Here you have a hand and draw at the end of your turn like a normal card game.  Frankly it's a lot less interesting.

But it kind of stalls out.  The dialogue is good, too, but the plot line never really comes together in a particularly intriguing way.  The ""memory"" puzzles, while novel at first, become a bit waring by the end because they never really develop into anything.  In fact, just generally the puzzles never do much. I was excited for this because I really enjoyed Cognition immensely, and of course I liked Jane Jensen's Gabriel Knight a lot, but this fell flat for me.  That being said, I thought characters were very well realized and I would visit them again if there were another game in the series.  So, I suppose I will still give it a positive review.

There aren't really any puzzles to speak of.  Anything nearly along the lines of a puzzle like pulling levers or adjusting the hands on a cuckoo clock to the proper time are incredibly simple.  Most of the game is just wandering around hoping one of the rooms you've passed through 10 times before has something different in it.  A slow story that really never does get anywhere even in the last act is made mind numbingly slower by giving you nothing to do. There are some nice effects in the pixel art--although that is a mixed bag as the overall crudeness of it makes it sometimes hard to see what might be worth clicking on.  But the light and shadows in the art is very nicely rendered.  The aural landscape is very good, except in the last chapter where they seem to have forgotten it.  If the Edgar Allen Poe/H.P.

76561197986997483,24,Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller,"Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"Cognition is an absolutely wonderful mystery/thriller with a well plotted story that is very satisfying to play through.  Everyone who thinks they might like it should definitely buy it. I want to make that very plain at once because everything else I have to say about it is complaints.  The constant frustrations from beginning to end are just astounding.  Towards the beginning they are most game design issues, while in the last two chapters they are mostly technical issues.  In fact the last two chapters froze up so many times, I felt like I'd played through them both twice by the end.  The suspense was primarily situated in whether I would make it all the way through a cut scene or if it would hang between lines of dialogue.  And this is particularly troublesome because the last two parts are wonderful and genius.  Before I got to them, I thought the game was good, but not as good as Still Life.  In the first two chapters there are a lot of poor busy work puzzles, two absolutely obnoxious characters (the CSI guy and the coroner), and this horrible idea of giving you a cell phone but ALWAYS forcing you to actually go visit a person when you have to talk to them.  It's like the cell phone is taunting you.  The other bad thing, is all the time you spend watching slow jerky walking animations.  Why are the sets so large with about three things to interact with on each?  They could easily all fit on screen.  But no, invariably you must walk back and forth slowly and jerkily over at least two screens just to find out there's still something you need in another location completely.  The worst offender is the beautiful apartment in chapter 3.  (You notice how I'm compelled to compliment it even while complaining about it?)  In this apartment where you spend most of your time you must walk back forth around kitchen counters, islands, and coffee tables and dining tables that fill the screen.  The game seems to mostly be how to find a pixel's worth of floor space you can click on to get Erica moving in the right direction. The only problem I have with the plot is that there is a suggestion throughout the last chapter that you will have some opportunity to decide what happens to certain characters, whether you kill them or bring them to jail, I'm fine with what the game decides to happen but not so fine with the fact that it suggested you'd have more agency in it when you do not. The game is so good.  While the busy work puzzles are generally awful or unbelievable, the central puzzles are always wonderful, the way the various psy powers work out always very inventive and intricately planned out, the plot is very well done and never disappointing.  I like too that you don't have to like the good guys or dislike the bad guys.  Cognition is wonderful gem, but really Phoenix Studios, shape up.",17.6 hrs on record,N/A

On top of that the game was clearly intended to be played with a full screen resolution and all the graphics are squished top to bottom.  This remains the case even if you play in windowed mode.

There are a lot of repeated puzzles in particular.  In terms of plot this one is so different I'm a bit at a loss as to why it is part the ""Grim Legends"" series.  The first one had a vaguely fairy tale/Angela Carter feeling to it.  The second was the fairy tale of the Seven Swans.  This one has nothing to do with fairy tales but seems more inspired by steam punk.  At first it was a welcome change, but as I played I found the story a bit irritating.  You play a girl with amnesia fighting against people whose sins have opened them up to being possessed by other dimensional monsters.  But your own story is rather non-existent throughout the whole thing.  Also the moral seems to be a bit based on Pandora's box.  The boy in the story causes all of the trouble by investigating the occult and not submitting to the natural order, which is a point of view I've always taken as being anti-science. Still the game is smooth as ever and about as good as a hidden object adventure can be.  As always I wish the logic puzzles were harder versions of the same puzzles.

There's a good deal of traditional inventory based adventure game puzzles, enough that I'd say the game might appeal to tradtional adventure gamers as well, but it never gets very hard.  Besides that, there's lots of stuff to find that isn't necessary unless you want to get 100% achievements, and I like that as well. The story is okay.  I think it might have benefitted from having a bad guy with a more distinct personality and more obvious motive than ""the abyss"". What I would like to see would be the ability to choose more difficult versions of the logic puzzles.  At one point for instance there is one of the puzzles where you must light up all the streets by placing lights such that they can't see one another.  Well, for anyone who has done this puzzle before, the one in the game is a particularly easy version of it.  And it is possible to make this sort of puzzle quite difficult.  Couldn't there be three versions of each logic puzzle, one for each difficulty?  It would just change the set up, not the art and so forth.

And it in general it was a lack luster experience.  The puzzles which impede your progress are too easy to really be considered puzzles.  Easily find a thing and put it on the obvious hotspot.  There was some hope of decoding an alien language toward the end, but all you really have to decode is on and off which I figured out by looking at the first alien console.  So, it didn't take much brain power. Considering the dearth of puzzles, I thought about regarding it more along the lines of interactive fiction.  But it's just all stuff we've seen countless times before there.  I was particularly reminded of the episode of Battlestar Galactica where Starbuck crash lands on an alien world and has to hot wire a Cylon drone to get away.

76561197986997483,24,Broken Sword 5 - the Serpent's Curse,Adventure,Recommended,"Certainly the best Broken Sword game so far, and one I can easily recommend--although with some reservations. Despite loving adventure games, I can say I've never really been a big fan of the Broken Sword Series, the first one was alright, but due to the similar subject matter felt a lot like the third Gabriel Knight game, but with worse puzzles and less charasmatic leads.  The second Broken Sword game makes my list of worst adventure games, and the third was fun enough, but its pleasure came in the unusual platforming and stealth areas at which other games have done much better.  So it was that I never really jumped at buying this one. That turns out to be a mistake.  First of all The Serpent's Curse is gorgeous.  I didn't mind a bunch of simple puzzles that did little other than waste my time in the first act, just because I loved seeing every environment.  So much attention to detail in the art too I loved the inside of Bijoux's apartment for instance, which caught her personality even better than her dialogue did. In the second act the puzzles improve quite a bit.  It does in that act include one puzzle they should have axed involving a cockroach that is on the level of the cat hair mustache in GB3 or the inflatable duck to get the railway key in Longest Journey.  However, that excepted, Act 2 has a very nice assortment of puzzles including some particularly memorable ones in which you must decode a map and decipher a hieroglyphic language. The plot is fairly interesting throughout, if a bit safe.  It goes exactly the way you'd expect and never really explores new territory, but that is okay if it's a story you don't mind hearing again.  And it is one which allows the artists to dazzle you.  Also on the negative side is a number of tiresome comic relief characters and an uninspiring will-they-won't-they dynamic between the leads.  Especially considering they have before. I must agree with reviewers that you control George too much and Nico not enough.  There really should have been more balance here and in one place where you DO control Nico, it makes little sense.  There is a scene in which George and Nico must pose as insurance investigators.  George is an insurance investigator in his daily life, yet Nico--who is a reporter--takes the lead? Later, or possibly right before that scene, George interrogates a man who has come to see Nico because of a report she wrote on a robbery--wouldn't it make more sense for Nico--the reporter--to have conducted that interview?  It is bizarre.  And then, of course, there are numerous scenes throughout where it wouldn't matter which character you control except that it is almost always George.  Ah well.  I suppose it is a little thing really. Buy this for the art and the puzzles in the second act.  There is also a story and some characters, those shouldn't annoy you enough to keep you from enjoying it.",9.6 hrs on record,N/A

I love how inventive all the troops are, different armies suggest different strategies, and I like how the game forces you to keep changing out troops by only having so many available to hire.  It forces you to find the strategies, as opposed to just something you might do on your own like in another game. Add to this tons of invention in the plot--not the main plot, that is dull as dishwater, but in everything that happens on the way there, from zombie brides to Pinnocchio like whales, there's always something unexpected around the corner. My only negative is that at the end of it all, it's ruined me for the genre, I just can't get into other HOMM-likes now because i've just spent so gosh darn long on this one.

I think it's a good mix of exploration and action.  The dialogue could use some work but that's about my only complaint, and I quite like that the combat is limited to areas where you know there are going to be bad guys and it isn't like the similarly themed game, the Ball, where you have to handle the combat and exploring/puzzling at the same time. About my only complaint is that it's easy to leave an area accidentally and then you can never return; so it's possible I've missed a few secrets but I will never know.

There is nothing to discover.  The most you see of the girl's life is a few poems and a spattering of selfies.  Instead the game almost immediately starts you on a story that would have made more sense as a short film, and in fact, the final scene requires that anyway. There are some good things.  The writing does sound like a girl trying to sound cute.  The acting is fine.  And the art is very graphic.  I would like to see another game from the designer.

Mostly because of the gorgeous environments, the interesting races, and the multitude of things to discover.  The races play extremely differently from one another, which gives the game far more replayabilty than Civ in which the differences are so minor that you would do fine even if you didn't look up your race's special ability.  Also, there is more of a focus on adventuring, kind of like Age of Wonders, so you are never left just clicking end turn over and over again while you wait for your human opponents to wage interminably long wars.  Finally city management is more interesting with it allowing you to put your citizens to work in different ways. My only complaint is the wonky combat system which makes perhaps too many choices for you, but it is interesting too, I think of myself as more of a general while my troops do what they think is best. Some additional thoughts: I'd like to update my review because for the first time I played through the game all the way to the end on the largest map size and I have some additional thoughts.  Before, I've only won the game on small maps against few opponents.  This is because once you take out one or two other empires, no one can stand up to you any more.  This is true about a lot of 4X games. And maybe it's part of why I have traditionally preferred smaller, scenario based 4X's like Heroes of Might and Magic, Disciples, and Age of Wonders, to these sprawling history of the world things like this and Civilization.  The rewards for defeating an enemy in these games are too vast.  In the real world, the war effort depletes the resources of both sides, in these games, the winner gets brand new fully built up cities in addition to eliminating an enemy that might have previously been putting pressure on him.  There must be a better way to do this in these games.  Crusader Kings has a lot of interesting ways to keep the player from dominating the globe.  Principally, when your ruler dies, depending on your government-type, everything gets divvied up, or at the very least, the new ruler starts off with a lot lower favorablilty among his nobles than the old guy.  I don't know if similar things would work for Endless Legend or Civ, since you don't have people underneath of you in these games.  (although there are some interesting government and political ideas explored in Endless Space 2, which is trending in the right direction) Other than the overall challenge as the game progressed, there were some nice ideas in the later game.  Quest rewards increased at about the proper rate to always make them about the same amount worth doing.  They would give you rarer resources or even heroes or super powered artifacts.  In many ways the quests are a big part of what makes Endless Legend interesting from turn to turn, in comparison to Civ, where I feel like a lot of the game is just waiting for this or that to get done.  There are too many quests, however,  which makes them blur together.  Whereas I think Amplitude has mostly improved between Legend and Space 2, I think the quests are better in this game.  I that game there are also too many quests filling up your queue, but the rewards aren't really enough to make pursuing them worthwhile, and, since there aren't cool artifacts as in this game, you don't have any momento of the quests, which would allow you to think, I earned this from helping that minor faction. Well, I still highly recommend the game, even if I definitely do not recommend finishing it.  The real star of the game is the incredible variety of the factions which makes playing as each a unique game all in one box.  But I think you should only play them until you can see that there's no way you could lose and then go on to the next. As a final note, I've come down on the side of liking the combat system.  It helps to speed things up and I kind of like that not all the power is in my hands at that level, because in what game is the tactical combat AI good enough to stand up to human players?  That your troops seem to make some choices for themselves helps to level the playing field.",142.3 hrs on record																					(36.5 hrs at review time),N/A

I think if it had had a story to pull you through, I would have like it more, but what little there is is very besides the point.  Also, maybe it's my computer but some of the time my jump command doesn't make it through or is a bit delayed.

76561197986997483,27,Sorcery! Parts 1 and 2,"Adventure, Indie, RPG",Recommended,"This is kind of a weak recommendation.  This is a solo RPG that has been ported to the computer.  The company that has done it has really done a good job in doing so, which is why I still recommend it even though it is rather over-priced.  Like the book it is based on the game is really short.  You can finish it in one sitting and perhaps see as much of it as you'd like in two or three playthroughs.  Between that, and the fact that the superior Lone Wolf books are available for free and that the world of Sorcery is sadly generic, I would only recommend buying this if it is on a pretty good sale. The best part of the game is what the Inkle has added, the combat system.  Here you pick a strength of attack based on what you think your opponent might do next.  Your opponent has tells written into the text descriptions of the fights that you can use choose the best course of action.  Usually, you want your hits to be just slightly stronger than your opponent's.  And if you can't beat your opponent, you must defend.  It all comes together beautifully, and is much more fun than throwing the dice. The other part I quite like about the game is that you can role play a bit.  Perhaps this is the trade off for the world itself not seeming particularly real, as it leaves the writing a lot terser than Lone Wolf (I compare this to it so often because I had several of these series as a kid and found Lone Wolf to be the most memorable).  In Sorcery!, you are given quite a few more options than what direction to travel and whether to help someone or kill them.  It's what makes you want to play through the game more than once to see what another choice may bring. The worst part of the game is probably how you cast spells.  I wish the game would just supply me with a list of spells I might want to cast, rather than have me spell them out.  It takes a lot of flipping back and forth to the spell book, which isn't even particularly easy to access.  Often I take the warrior path because it's more fun, which shouldn't be the case in a game called Sorcery!",3.6 hrs on record																					(3.3 hrs at review time),N/A
76561197986997483,27,The Talos Principle: Road To Gehenna,"Action, Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"I absolutely loved it.  I liked the story before, but they have improved on it.  There was plenty of humor along the way and in the end I was thinking about it from a few different angles.  I will say this came off a lot more Nihilistic to me than the Existential leanings of its predecessor.  So, I didn't really feel good about things at the end, but I suppose that is to be expected from a game called Road to Gehenna. The puzzles seemed easier, or else I'm better at them.  The stars are definitely easier.  Really nothing in this game required me to turn it off and come back to it later, but I will also point out I solved a lot of the puzzles in ways I realized later were not intended by the developers.  For instance, I figured out how to put a laser relay on top of an incredibly high up pillar in the Egyptian world (it took many steps including setting up another laser on top of the puzzle with the floating disk.  The pillar however you can see pretty much from anywhere in the level including the pit, which made the puzzles a bit basic.  I suspected this wasn't what was intended because from the pillar you can jump outside of the level and there were no secrets around the edges, though it was interesting.  Similarly, in the Aqueduct world I managed to get a box outside of one level which let me easily retrieve more than one star.  I only realized this wasn't the intended solution because only later did I hop along the top level of the aqueduct where I came upon the now unnecessary fan.  There were other similar circumstances.  I wonder if not solving the puzzles as the developers intended made my playthrough easier or harder overall.  My pillar puzzle was probably the hardest thing I completed in the game, after all.",0.0 hrs on record,N/A

76561197986997483,27,Knytt Underground,"Adventure, Indie",Recommended,"My feelings on this one are a bit mixed, and in general I will give a recommendation to an indie game I have mixed feelings about. There are a lot of ideas here, but I think the story-telling in particular didn't work out.  The stories were so spread out and so jumbled over the many hours of play, it was difficult to necessarily remember characters from time to time as they came up.  Even with the three protagonists, this was a problem, as I couldn't always recall what details were true of which one. The second thing that didn't work out was the warp zones.  The entries to them were so spread out, and the exits not marked on the map at all.  So it always seemed better not to use them and walk straight to where I was going, rather than possibly walk the same distance and break a crystal. What is great is the feeling that you are exploring a real space.  This isn't an over map and castles, everywhere is connected to everywhere else, there are no barriers. There are also some quite surprisingly beautiful set pieces, with music that wonderfully accompanies them. And as in Knytt, the pitter patter of the running and jumping is very satisfying. Finally, I have not idea why this game is M-rated.  Because one of the characters is a lesbian?

Particularly this is annoying because I didn't even know there were secret rooms until after I'd finished the game and noticed I hadn't gotten any of the steam achievements. Good writing, good core gameplay, beautiful environments.  However, don't be fooled, you're mostly paying for style not substance here.  The game is rather short (5-6 hours) and the puzzles never really rise beyond a medium difficulty--this is no fish fillets 2 of toughness.  There was really only a single room that even gave me pause, and that might not be the case for someone else because I felt stupid after I realized I simply had to begin the puzzle from a different location in the room.

I sometimes would look at the hint for a puzzle after I solved the puzzle itself to see what that page of the hint book looked liked. What I don't care for is that there's really nothing going on in the story, and there's too much dialogue when there should really be next to none.  The game is about showing us the world not listening to a woman complain about her husband using too much salt on his hamburgers.  That stuff does nothing for me.  Also the more traditional inventory style puzzle you must complete to get to the combination/slider block/what have you sorts of puzzles are a bit annoying.  Running back and forth over the screen to give this item to that person is tedious when you have to go up and down ladders and wait for the world to rotate.

But make sure you have a controler.  There is one of the quick time events that is impossible to do with a mouse.  You have to click the left button as fast as possible, but at least my mouse won't pick up individual clicks that fast, so when those come up, I have to pull up the options screen find the binding for the action, switch it to a keyboard button, do the quick time event, then switch it back to the left mouse button.

I suppose none of that is usual for the series which is why this has a mixed rating.

It's this odd rhythm game that is fun at first, but there's so much of it by the end of the game, you eventually can't stand it anymore.  Also the Riddler puzzles were the most fun for me and also ultimately a bit of a let down, they never went from intermediate to hard difficulty, and I was really hoping for some metapuzzle that would tie them together that never happened.  There also could have been more inventiveness in the boss fights.  But as I say worht playing for the story, atmosphere alone.  Not to mention the fun bat-stealth elements.

76561197986997483,34,Warlock 2: The Exiled,Strategy,Recommended,"My favorite 4X.  I like that the different campaigns are very different.  You can play a conquer your neighbors game like any other, on either a series of worlds or on a large world with the other worlds attached as possible, though not necessary places to explore; or you can compete to be the first to finish a series of increasingly difficult quests in what maybe shouldn't be the default game mode;  or if you have the expansion you can play against a single strong opponent who appears in the middle of your civilization, nagas this time rather than dremers as in the first game.  I like that this final mode encourages you to work together with your opponents whether they are computer players or human players, and I like that computer allies really will help you.  This is something very lacking in really all the other 4X games, where it is just a fight for supremacy. The other thing that sets this game appart is the focus on tactical combat and exploration rather than civilization building or roleplaying (as in the Age of Wonders or HOMM series).  I like this. You start off right away with an army and your army grows just as much as you want it to, as you can build units at the same time as buildings in your cities.  (a bizarre restriction in the Civ games and in the Endless games)  There are so many different types of neutral units that hide great rewards in their spawn points.  Much of the early game is just plain survival, and it's a lot of fun.  It never seems like you've explored everything.  Even after 100s of hours that I've spent in both Warlock 1 and 2 combined.  In multiplayer turns are turn-based rather than simultaneous, but as everything happens on the main map, and you can watch your allies, things don't seem as boring as HOMM (which I would never play multiplayer). I really am liking Endless Space and Endless Legend as well, those really have a lot to discover, but this has a pick up and play quality and a, I must play just a few more turns, quality that keeps me playing this even when those are available.  I suppose I would play those when I want something more serious, and this when I want something fun, while the old standards of Civ and HOMM are really starting to feel more OLD than standard in their current iterations.",93.9 hrs on record																					(51.8 hrs at review time),N/A

My learning and prowess got so high after about a year of taking contracts and doing military training that I decided to join the Seljuk's invasion of the Byzantine empire for a mere 25 gold. But as I was starting to lay siege, the Byzantium emperor realized it was in his best efforts to buy me off and utilize my exceptional skills by granting me the duchy of Athens. I converted me and my court into becoming Orthodox, schemed my relative into getting the duchy of Antioch, did a few pilgrimages while conquering Sardinia, then Holy warred a chunk of North Africa, and after only a few years managed to scheme to become the Byzantium emperor.

Tactics games are information-heavy, thus you need to see stats easily, which other games show when you mouse over or press the tab button, for instance. I love the retro ""GBA-style"" pixel art and tiles, but I don't have the patience for all the 1990s-era battle menu and button presses.

Not a logistics game...sending goods along a snaking path though every station yields the same amount of money as a short direct connection, so the game ends up mainly being a matter of identifying and making the cheapest connections. And trying to achieve combo chains which essentially priorities you in delaying actually satisfying good demands until you can make one final connection that satisfies all those demands (which seems like a counter-intuitive way to connect stations, but is a consequence of the combo mechanism) The graphics and track layout engine are fantastic, however.

76561198060513531,4,For The King II,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy",Recommended,"Graphics are beautiful, which is great if that is primarily what you care about. But unfortunately that means it takes like 10 seconds to switch between battle view and overland view and for some reason takes a few seconds for the market list to populate for some reason. And UI is worse. Basic things like trying to compare my players stats (which is sometime I like to do whenever I see a challenge on the map) takes 3 clicks: first move mouse to lower right corner and click on inventory to see the current player's inventory, then move mouse to a little icon to see info about their skills, then click on compare all button. Otherwise it seems to play just like the original, with the primary gameplay difference the 2x4 battle board, which doesn't seem terribly interesting. So far basically the only strategy is to either spread your players out if the enemy uses area of attack effects, or otherwise to keep your players with weaker defenses behind shield users. But otherwise (at least as far as I've gotten in the first chapter) there is no darkest-dungeon style of position manipulation. So I don't think the battle boards makes the game significantly more interesting over the original.

And every turn I end up having to waste time buying all the food from the marketplace and manually distributing to any of my cities that could potentially increase in population that turn. And like most 4x strategy games, you end up with exponential growth of cities and units, which means every subsequent turn drags on and on.

For instance maxing out stress simply removes your HP but doesn't give interesting quirks.  There is no swapping in-and-out characters between levels to balance recovering them and picking a new tailored party for the next level.  Rather, each playthrough is is just the same party over and over just like most other RPGs. And it is a rouge-lite whereby you unlock abilities for subsequent playthroughs, which is a different style of game from DD1.
