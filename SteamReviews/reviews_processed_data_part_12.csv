Now I actually want more vampires. Was really nice, the army is well structured and a blast to play Buy on good sale I recommended tho, like many of the DLC's",0.0 hrs on record,N/A
76561198032398246,1,N/A,Recommended,"Im surpised Im playing this game again,  and I actually enjoyed it for most part. One thing I wont forget is that you took away my C5 drones, whoever was crying about it, now sitting in his tank laughing. I took a lot of preparation and waiting to get it right. And if you would blow up 2 tanks in all the game, you did actually good. So it wasnt OP, just those tankers ALWAYS crying, they the Karens of this game. But they can sit all day in the back killing players, thats ok. But good, its already history for some time, we not going to look back. The game is enjoybale, I still rat everyone out, I follow them, chase them, stalk them if needed. Me no C5 you no hiding place. I rat you all game long. The new event looks nice, in the end still some redemption, if its enough we have to see the next game, for now it's actually enjoyable, but at what cost. On the last 100 meters from finish, the thumb goes up",27.5 hrs on record																					(26.5 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198032398246,1,N/A,Recommended,"The game was actually nice to play, still EA, so we wait. But actually they dont want even to add new stuff to the game. All they say constantly is that the player should make their game its a sandbox, but they dont give us any tools for this sandbox. We waiting for new game feature and they come up with the most boring stuff that has nothing to do with the gameplay. Integration of Discord... wow.. really,..... we waiting for months and this is it. They have no plans in investing in making the tools for ppl to use the sandbox. My money is gone, but maybe you can save yours. The game can feel a bit boring, but thats not a problem, its got its charm, till a certain extense, we need tools, stuff to do. Social stuff to do, made by the community BUT also supported with what the game has to give. You cant give a game like this and say, good luck with the game, and send us your screenshots and vids for us to display. I feel my money is gone, the devs for some reason dont want to invest time in the right stuff, than there is just a choice, my choice not to play it. When I go to my server, if I see 1 person in 2 hours Im happy to see finally someone. A social games doesnt mean to let everything to the players, there should be a red line thru everything thats the devs should put out for the players to use how they want. But there is no red line and they dont have any intention to create one, thats what I understand from their messages they put out. I dont see it happening anymore, I set myself to ease  by knowing I made a wrong gamble this time and got to accept this, dont gamble wrong too",207.0 hrs on record,N/A

For me the progression of the game is really good, while you play more you unlock fun other stuff. The combinations are a blast, you can make over the top OP cards. I like the sounds when the train is totaly full and your cards all packed with buffs, the sound is not beautiful, but catching, and I like the raw sound of the abilities clashing into each other. Its cool and easy to play some rounds, make comobs and have fun. Game is fun and well made, for sure worth your time",8.3 hrs on record,N/A

It made me reinstall Edit: Have you ever wanted to play this game and thought it was all so chaotic and you lost overview? Guess what... they have tactical pause cam now, In which you can give orders. If you want a singleplayer where for once you not playing that chaotic and will look like a pro, this game just gives the best present to strategic gamers, that dont like the fast scroll and click style. Have you been struggling all those years with all kind of games cause of the overwview? stop and play this, you will feel as you are the greatest General ever lived.

76561198032398246,1,N/A,Recommended,"If you dont understand these type of games, but you still feel like you would like to try them. This game is a very good one to start with, it got really the best build up from all games to learn the ropes. I played all the others inculding WARNO, (which has a reasonable good tutorial too tbh) but besides that. This game literary starts with 1 unit, and than builds up, was a really good way of learning what everything means and which vehicles do what. After this game I could play any other wargame and already have a good basic understanding and than the victories in missions started coming and you get a real nice feeling when that happens. Still more than enough to learn, but its nice to have a good basic understanding of this type of games and this game provides that. Good game on top of that",5.4 hrs on record																					(1.7 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198032398246,2,N/A,Recommended,"I have the game on the Xbox and on steam, thats how much I like it. Especially the 3-click shots makes you feel like a professional golfer, Its so nice, and the only reason I bought this game, in other 2k Golf games I would miss a lot of easy shots or nice puts would go totaly wrong. If your line was not straight with the sticks in other 2k Golf games, try this now. My handicap is already +14 (on normal) and Im having amazing games, rivalaries. This game you could play as super casual or hardcore gamer. You dont have time to play too much sweaty games? no worries, casual game (or even champioships) are there. its too easy and you want really to push it to the limit? Its there, push winds and crazy greens are there. I think they made a nice game, which I truly enjoy. The microtransactions, its 2k or EA or whatever, we already know. And IF you buy it, you also know. Everyone knows. Yes there in it. They always in it. Those microtransactions are not THAT bad. You can upgrade your clubs yes, but sounds like a nice thing for me as a gamer, it gives a gaming element to it, if you play the PGA tour, you get loads and you can custom your clubs to your play style, nothing wrong with that. You have skills, so you can specialize in anything you want, green, wood, driver. wedge... you can be what you want, and the skills are not that crazy strong, its a nice addition. Balls are okish, could be better,  everyone can refill balls. You play 2 games against the CPU, choose a rivalary that gives you credits and you have it already. Yes, I must admit, the balls are a bit overdone, I mean, the clubs I can understand somehow, but the balls hmm, they a little too good. Why wouldn't I want extra flight and hit 330+ Yards? What I didn'really like are some of the ballskins or some clothings they have, I mean, I dont need to look like a clown, neither does my golf ball. The golf balls with the hats are just psychological not good for your head, in my head the hats are in the way, I never choose them.  The Xmas stick, I personally hate it, I hate it in all games, just not RPG's, but in sports games, those clown clothings and skins are not nice for me, but again, its 2K, next time EA... we know, we all know, I know, there are microtransactions and clown clothings and skins. But that doesnt mean the game is not nice, on the contrary, its very nice! and you can put on the clothings you want and 2K made a nice way of getting clothings and club and balls, every time you have another sponsor, unlocking that brand specific locked items, I really like this part. BUT other sponsors dont need to tell/ask me every time after a game 3x that they intrested, its not like when I decline them they gone, they still there to choose, so the messages are in the way, as on the sponsor page I can check this and choose there. I already know everyone wants me, Im a golf beast. dont need to tell me 3 times after every game. Get in line! The only really annoying thing for me is rearaging your golfbag, applying skins or fittings, the menus dont make that much sense, and many times ALL skins jump back to another skins and idk why. I would understand this could bring frustration to players. Sometimes I just gave up on skins and played 2-3 games before trying again, and many times than it would be fine. I think it has to do the way you enter the club options, from which menu, but idk, I hope they kinda work on this. I give it 8.5/10 What to say more, the game is so relaxed to play for me, especially the 3 click system made a HUGE difference for me, NOW im playing golf. You could play too, cause in 2 hours you will for sure know if you want to keep the game or not.",4.5 hrs on record																					(3.9 hrs at review time),N/A

I died much times without knowing why, but that doesn't mean I didn't like it. I liked to walk aroud en be careful, hidden in the bushes and than die or to hide in a house and than die. The people were nice on the chat not toxic and than I died.  Once i went around the battle and I died. Finally I saw a group of allies, one shoot at me and I died. You will die, but it didn't feel unfair its just made me wanna know, why I died. I like the pace and I like the different roles you can take, I like to play anti tank and than I die.

76561198032398246,4,N/A,Recommended,"The game is fun, Graphics are nice, the battles too. Campaign is ok, little bit rushed imo. Go there and there and there and there and do this in 10 turns, yeah some are scout quests, still feels little bit I can't enjoy what Im doing. BUT the things you encounter are fun, 1st it's just 3 bugs, you think its ok... but later also bugs, and more really destructive things.. RUUUUN What I like most is making mods and making different kind of varieties of the same unit, to find out some are very good and some very bad.  Gearing you hero is nice, giving it new guns and skills and making your hero at the start is also nice, I made a really bad ass scary commander. The worst thing is the voice acting, sometimes you miss it and when it's there it's kinda bad. I like the silly story, but could be narrated to be more inspiring and quest and other things maybe too. The battles are quiet fun, it can be frustrating cause 1st you have to figure out what counters what to do max damage, but there's a indication before you attack which helps alot already. For me was fun, though the campaign could be a bit nicer, more complete with voice and a little bit slower on quests, instead of 10 maybe 12 or 15 turns for some, especially at the same time, maybe some more events. Still there are nice suprises during the campaign for me to have enojoyed it.",37.0 hrs on record																					(26.3 hrs at review time),N/A

All the hours Ive spent even in career mode are just on Australia. I've put the game so much times away telling I just can't make that stupid nasty corner the one before the pit and the not so sharp turn after that I mostly need to gas down to get good on the straight. It misses flow still amd grass is still my ""best"" friend. After I failed sometimes, I went so see the Australia 2018 and 2019 races and it helped me. I went back to the game and my times improved almost 1 sec. after that i failed again. Than I bencmarkt the race and I learned some more from the ai, another 1sec faster after watching that. Its indeed great fun to see the race, I clicked on a tutorial on Youtube on f1 and I knew he was doing Australia. Maybe a controller is not the best, Im getting a wheel tomorrow., the rush I get when I got 4 secs down on the track with a ferrari was amazing, worth every heavy discounted penny I paid and worth to buy a wheel. My favourite car would me Mclaren ,nice stable, but the ferrari is a beast. I first had the strange stutter too, what was freaking amazing annoying, cause in that 1-2 secs youd lose control, and I already suck enough to have a stutter on top What I did was to nvidia Geforce experience settle the graphics for f1 for me and that helped, never a stutter again. I have rtx 2070, it puts the screen on 3840x2160 dsr although in have a 1080p screen, but it works super smooth.

It has comentary and some decent graphics and a good range of different kind of customazations. Hats, sneakers, glasses, bandanas and some other stuff to unlock, the jackets look the best, you can make a new char for 20k$ what is not so crazy much, maybe 3 fights or trainings. The first half hour I didn't get you attacking 1 round and defending 1 round. I first was searching for my defence card to play, but you have a defence deck and an attack deck for each round. If you play head card and he plays a headcard too than its a defence. For this price fore sure its good, it could be 10 bucks and nobody would complain. there are some small things ofc what could be improved like the KO or TKO moment could be abit more fluent, or that when you are in the training and go to deck it would be nice to go back to trainng and not to the main menu or to search cards by name maybe. Or for me the biggest, why I cant fight others in multiplayer. But to be honest if was really fun once you understand that you have a deck for each round, and take away old cards with the less energy but with equal or more power or defence to get better. I made first an more obvious choice with bxoing and kickboxing and later made a mu thai wrestling mix, what I like cause of the defence.

Walk around with your party and gear them , let them travel , others gather and work at ""home"". You can let them built what you want, let them wear what they want as long as they can carry it all. The music is nice, the voice acting like in the intro is not always as good but nothing disturbing. playing unlocks some other things, what is nice imo, others for sure wants eveything on the plate, but hey you get good in the overall game instead of games where you just choose 1 faction and spam 1 op skill and you win 80.000 times in a row .

I like that things happening on the way, very different events. I like the sound, it made me more into the game. its nice to travel and go for things sse what will be next. Maybe you find pirates, maybe your ship got hit. You never know. I don't have real -/- cause its made very clear, ingame also,  its still been working on. Ofc we want more, weapons, more armor, more more more ,I think the developer knows all that and it will come with time. If there would be something maybe could be that when you buy things in the shop, that would be nice to see your squad to compare if I need something. I recommend for me. For you I don't know.

76561198032398246,5,N/A,Recommended,"I played this game for quiet some time mobile at the first years of the game, its very nice, nice graphics, cool heroes, nice surrounding. When they changed the forest I saw an interview with the devs and its was very nice how they think about the surroundings. If you're new, its very nice to get all the leveling awards at least it was like that. You just play and play more, and do ranked, and battle royal if you like it, first you will hate it, but later when you know almost all heroes you will like it to do sometimes, its quicker and yo never know what you get. First there was no 5vs5 , just 3vs3 , everyone wanted to have 5vs5 inlcuding me, but now that I see it, I kinda must say 3vs3 for me has more the vainglory feeling. its never good heh *sigh* Good to see all my heroes and the skins are still there. I really recommend this game if you like abit more serious MOBA. In my time ppl couldn't or didn't want to come back from a setback as a result of many AFK at higher level ranking, that was the only reason for me to quit the game, been playing sometimes to see how it is, and it stays fantastic. Sometimes new heroes tended to be a little bit op, like samuel when it came out, everyone had one on the team, and he did insane damage. Some heroes look ez, but they are not if you dont know what you doing. Saw being nr 1 mistake alot of ppl make and the other is Koshka and Krul. Ringo would be good for new players, just keep farming and check ur gear after mid game should be fine. End game is deadly. Skaarf is also not bad for beginners, just be the glass cannon. Vox was always cool to play, and much tim underrated, but he can really melt. A more tanky , phinn is ez to understand and can be fun and annoying as hell. My favourites are petal and Reim. petal is a good taka killer. Yes there are many takas you're going to encounter, figure yourself out why... watch his gear, if red def red... if blue def blue..you really going to need it! And take flaires with you, if you tank or support maybe flair gun. if they have a taka, for sure someone or even 2 take flares. In the beginning you might think is not needed, but later when they start using it on you, you will see how efficient it can be. And there is so much more. I think the more serious gamer will like it and casual too, try to level and youll see that the awards are not bad and can get you heroes and or skins.",0.4 hrs on record,N/A

I had a beast even for while, the freedom of skills was nice, how the game is now no clue. I want to try but something is holding me back, espescially the difference in game and paywall sounds. Still I can just say ive enjoyed this game back than, pve I dont know, I was all the time in pvp, was really amazing.

Even the one thing I really dislike about some TD's this game does very good and that is the hero. I really hate TD's with heroes cause it takes away the feeling of classic TD. Here it easy to control him/her and its not the most important, the towers stay the most important.

76561198032398246,5,N/A,Recommended,"The game is cool. You can play it casual. I play a few missions a day and its cool. It could have a more engaging way to kinda campaign more or something of a path. The taking over the mines is ok but you need to clear just 1 waves to get it, could be that if I survive 6 rounds the difficulty goes to 6 for the next one who tries to take it. I must say honestly I like the game on itself and I put a small amount into the game les than 10 euro, but when I see a level 2 of the same tower as a new tower this kinda took some motivation away. How much more upgrades will there be of  that tower. I like it, but its not the best TD cause of the world, you not really going somewhere or have a goal or story or campaing and there is not really multiplayer, its not lane vs lane or something and you cant choose your defense, how is the defense set up when you defend even. I still recommend for casual playing, but saying that, what more than casual there is in the game. I think what I just like of the game is the towers itself, the diversity. I can imagine if you come from the  known good TDs as kingdom rush or warstone this one kinda will disappoint you.",100.9 hrs on record																					(74.0 hrs at review time),N/A

I think if Id play the tabletop maybe Id be more into the entourage of the game. Its nice made, cool sound, nice graphics and would recommend if you like slow pace robot shooting, I just think in the end I didnt feel the hits hitting for real, so I didnt get it, still reccomend, there nothing wrong with the game, you just need to be into this. Edit 8 July  2019: I tried it again, and I liked it a little bit more it keeps looking good, the robot still look good, they shoot better a bit even. My issue now is still that there is no point in the game, it's more a try out of robots with a small object and thats it. It's still so empty the game, no story, no real modes of leaderboards or anything. Something lke your own custom robot. Else i think I would start to play, if theres something to play for, a story or something even.

It's a card game, with the stats on 4 sides you can boost your card with Gold cards,Gear and maybe other things, you. connecting the cards gives them extra buffs. It looks good, feels good. sound isn't annoying. Its good made. if its balanced? I dont know, played to less. But i think that tactical gamers who likes thinking in numbers will like it. the combos will make you think alot. I liked it. Also that you can upgrade stuff and build buildings that will help you in battle or making gold or something else. its free and cool to try. The tutorial is fast-paced and short (5-10 min) max. and as easy and kinda boring as other games. But wouldn't change it's almost all clear, just first i didn't know you could choose which card you want to play, first I thought you had to play the first card always first, but I fast understood that you could choose which card you play.

76561198032398246,6,N/A,Recommended,"I just have to say started this game on IOS. Ofcourse, I think like much who know the game, I said this is Gwent, just someone made it for IOS, whatever. Than I started  play and eventhough it still had alot of the feeling of Gwent, but slightly I started to see differences what I liked. -The rows in this game make sence -The campaign is way way more fun than Gwent. But tbh gwent was the worst single campaign I've ever played in what kind of game.. I literaly almost alseep, just clicking and all was good, It's so crazy boring easy. -The music and scene are more lighter, though not less fierce. -When I saw the 3D modeling of the cards, there I was really like damn I think I was wrong. the modeling of the cards is nice done, you see the depth of the cards, makes the card more worth. This game is NOT Gwent, its like comparing FIFA en PES is the same genre still people prefer one above the other? Why? cause it's different in his own way. The same for this game. This game is abit more adventure and I hope the devs will invest in the story of Runewards, I even had some laughs here and there.. why I'm helping that drunk bastard farmer XD he doesnt have a deck or something of his own? Good game. the only thing I like from heartstone I like they kinda use it, and its the UI, buttons , look. very good. And thanks good it's not like that game, but there is RNG of course, if you dont like RNG and you're a math fan, this game aint for you, better play prisamata, NO rng there. But this is an adventure and it makes the game replayable with the RNG, like that you can have different outcomes, else its boring. Try it for free, you can get a good feeling about it. The only thing I really liked more in GWENT are the kegs, they kinda made that part alot more fun of the monkey smasing the Kegs. But far from that I feel much more like this game has me comeback everytime to have a good time, and now on steam its even nicer.. keep the nice work up.

A tactical game, where you can make a free maze. I think the amount of turrets combined with the elements are kinda good too figure out, its up too you to put them as effecient as possible. I like the difficulty, some levels forces you to think about position alot.. . played it on the first go for 3 hours, didnt finish yet btw, just played tower defence, kinda the campaign, was nice, especially when you getting faster and discover multi-select (if you're new... a group of walls can be selected and upgrade) i like the automatic thing that counts the money you have even if you have too much walls/towers selected to upgrade so even if you dont have money for all walls/towers upgrade it will upgrade to the max gold you have, good feature, makes it faster. Im def going to come back, I want solve all. I say solve cause for me it had some kind of puzzle element in it, put the pieces right and they will melt. it could use some kinda story to make it even more alive, why I have to stop all those bugs? is the world ending or is my princess dying? Do I revenge my twin brother? Keep up the good work. Nice EA, nice concept and thrilling sometimes, epseically in the end waves. To upgrade or expand or support?

76561198032398246,6,N/A,Recommended,"I really like it, because it's weird. It's not really traditional CCG. The starting screen has some problem, as I dont know if its going further or not and I had crashed 2 times. And the window looks kinda out of shape, maybe its just loading like that. To start with the music, cause this has extreme contradictions. I dunno if the devs were stubborn about the music and decided to put all choices in it. They Flying all over with the music, what can be great or a disaster. Especially  the ""My card"" section, do not go in here with sound if you have nerve issues. I personaly want to skip this screen ASAP. Horrible nervebreaking music. But I like : ""you make me feel so good...."" LMFAO this music represents better the game. For me the game is funny, the stories are funny, as you start a fight , someone decides to go away,..... but eh we starting the fight, as she comes back , she takes a bear with her, and instead of fighting it, it joins you on your journey. And in the end its not a bear. And than hes in you deck later :-D The resource voice is nice, the system of leveling resources is ok, it is what it is, no plus, no down. The music while fighting reminds me so much of a game, but I can't recall which game. Its cool. no piano nervebreaking music at least, else I wouldnt play this game, I just couldnt. As I said before, the game is kinda weird, also when you kill multipe enemies, some voices says... double kill, triple kill, although a little bit slow, for me it's great, but does in belong here? At least if you do this, do it all the way, giving a wipe a special voice sound like : ""Devastating, killed all enemies"" The comment about the last hit being kinda slow for nothing is also true, its hits slow, but nothing happens special. We know hes going to die, we counting :-) so I think some special animation there would be in place or else just leave it out. I don't know if this game is appealing for a big group of people. I hope they will continue, I really like it, for me it's really weird and thats kinda what made me decide I want to play more. And the voice.

Wooo this is enjoying me alot. I watched somethings before and the art style I liked, and the gameplay seemed nice, but its much nicer than I thought it would be, really adventure. The small details are nice. How all the enemies die different. One explodes his head, the other stay stucked to the wall or on a rock. the other falls.

(Something like this) And make it clear and vivid that you have to do a task, flashing text or quest or whatever. Some voice maybe. It just states on the right in small text kinda what you have to do, it's readable, but it just don't feel like a real challenge or quest. Everything in the game feels like not serious.

When you play on a map, and you click for example on some point, and your units walking, if they encounter an enemy even if they attacked they keep running, ending in alot op HP loss.
