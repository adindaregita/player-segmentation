ACE COMBAT™ 7: SKIES UNKNOWN,"Action, Simulation","My only major negative is the story. All the characters are lame and everything comes across as incredibly campy. It is a fun game otherwise. Every mission is unique, with the only noticeably bad one being #20."
ACE COMBAT™ 7: SKIES UNKNOWN,"Action, Simulation","MEH, big meh. Bland storyline, Japanese melodrama with tons of made up country names and cheesy dialogues, extremely arcade flight dynamics, like almost like Descent games of the past. Not worth the buck, play it only if you are a fan of the series."
ACE COMBAT™ 7: SKIES UNKNOWN,"Action, Simulation","Honestly? Just insane. I used to play Ace Combat games on the PS1, but I completely disconnected from it over the years. Now, on PC, I was able to finally reconnect with this amazing franchise through Skies Unknown, and I wish I did it sooner. Outstanding game, it delivers so much than I expected from a dogfighting game. A gigantic amount of varied aircrafts with outstanding modelling and style, tight exhilarating combat, the expert controls are just as I remember from Ace 3, the graphics are nice, although LOD could be better, story is very well written and character dub delivers both in EN and JP. I have basically nothing negative to say about this one, not a single technical issue, this is as competent as a game can be. I am itching to go back to revisit the my dear old Ace Combat 3 someday and relive those memories. I don't care about multiplayer, but the DLC missions are also great."
ACE COMBAT™ 7: SKIES UNKNOWN,"Action, Simulation",I've never played anything from this series before.  But this one was fun. Dogfighting can get a little irritating but honestly my only real complaint is the bad storytelling.  Like a bad Metal Gear Solid ripoff. must be a Japanese thing.
ACE COMBAT™ 7: SKIES UNKNOWN,"Action, Simulation",I'm on the highway to the danger zone
ACE COMBAT™ 7: SKIES UNKNOWN,"Action, Simulation",Best ace combat game since 4. Glad they returned to strangereal. However what the funk were they thinking when they decided the only controller buttons displayed on the HUD would be on the damn XBOX controls? for real this game has native support for PS4 controllers and they legit didn't think to have an option for PS4 button icons? bro even indie devs support that bs in their games. off top
Age of Fear 2: The Chaos Lord GOLD,"Indie, RPG, Strategy","I bought this game in a bundle together with AoF 1 and 3. All the games share the same engine and the developer updates all of them frequently: this is important because it means that AoF 1 and 2 are not obsolete compared to AoF 3: they just have different campaigns. I needed about 20 hours to complete both campaigns (orcs and demons) at the expert level (the 2nd of 4): however I found the orc campaign a lot more difficult. Basically orcs haven't healing units and the “berserker” trait makes difficult to disengage from combat to drink an healing potion; moreover the ranged units are very weak, only the goblin assassins, unlocked in the second half of the campaign, are useful. I found the story a bit boring and uninspired: the story is not so important in this kind of game but if it is interesting and makes you curious then it motivates you to play on. Instead the demon campaign story was very nice: the dialogues between the heroes (a demon lady and a knight) are very funny and I was curious to discover the rest of it. The demon campaign is also a lot easier: basically the player can summon a lot of imps (ranged units) and use them as cannon fodder to weaken the enemies. These games are not masterpieces but they are traditional and solid strategy games: I am enjoying them (I am currently playing AoF 3...) and I absolutely recommend the bundle, especially if in sale."

Age of Wonders 4,Strategy,"Taking the best of AoW 3 and AoW Planetfall and adding even more customality!  I think my favorite new addition is the ability for you as the player and even the AI to play RANDOMLY GENERATED factions (the faction will still be of 1 of the game's standard races but all of their inherent abilities, starting skills, etc. will be randomly chosen)."
Age of Wonders 4,Strategy,"They removed racial traits in exchange for other customization options...but those options are mediocre and you only get 2 traits to start with. Game runs like ass and trying to run turns simultaneously just causes memory leaks and running it in normal turn order? Now at 5 minutes on turn 100 for the AI to finish moving. The battle animation speed up is done wrong as it applies to standing animations which make massive amounts of sound. The battle restart button doesn't work. The surrender option will not only murder most of your units even if they all escape unscaved, but it will force you to watch each turn and manually hit the end turn button. The random crashes and always crashing on exit? Creme de la Creme. For a 4th installment - the entire thing feels like rushed out garbage that needs massive bug fixes and optimizations - For comparison my rig runs the Civ 6 just fine. But don't worry....they had time for you to change your hero's pronouns."
Age of Wonders 4,Strategy,"Ok. Now that's a thing ! After playing civ, HoMM, whatever 4x, ... This AoW4 just redefine the genre for the decade to come ... No more no less. What a slap on my face dudes ! Edit: negative review until the CPU melting on highend computer disapear. And until this ""workaround"" option for drivers crash also disapear. Edit: Game is still burning CPU, even if not in game and browsing in still screens"
Age of Wonders 4,Strategy,"I want to love Age of Wonders 4. It has so many good bits. I love the customisation of the factions, the tomes of magic that are the development tree, the graphics are great, etc. etc. But that AI is so bad, and because it is so bad they have to stack the AI players with so many discounts and special costs, that it is a truly joyless affair beyond the first difficultly level. I'm fighting an AI empire with my army of like 5 stacks of 6 units, the most I can afford to pay upkeep on and keep developing. I defeat one full slightly bigger army of the AI, because it is awful tactically. Within two turns it has completely replenished that army, which I also defeat, but now my army is showing some wear. Two turns later...here comes another army of the same size. This just keeps happening. Tactically, the AI is dumb as a post, but I HAVE to play each of these battles tactically because if I use the ""auto-battle"" feature my general is just as dumb. So I end up playing multiple fairly dull tactical battles watching my army (which takes me a long time to replace) be eroded by the AI's stupid but countless forces. It ruins a sense that you are playing against an opponent that is vaguely similar to you. You are clearly playing as a human, and they are all weird and stupid computers who just can spam out armies 10 times faster than you can. I'm sure there are ways around this, I'm sure there are strategies I could be using to account for this, but I'm equally sure I would not find any of those strategies fun. It's a disappointment, I really was looking forward to this game and spent far more than I should have on getting it. I wish I had waited months for a sale. I'm 104 hours in (not much by 4X game standards) and I feel like I am done, it's just no fun to play against these dumb AI players. UPDATED: I'd heard that maybe they had fixed the AI somewhat. But nope, it still does exactly the same things it did before; spamming massive armies at a far greater rate than a human player with minimal intelligence. So disappointing, because there is so much that is well done in the game. Maybe I am missing something? I'm willing to be convinced I'm just playing wrong."
Antihero,"Indie, Strategy","If you can get this on sale for less than $5 (as I did), go for it. But I can't really call this worth $15. I finished the campaign in ~5 hours. At first, it was difficult, but once I realized half the units were just a waste to resources, I got through it rather fast. The end makes it sound like more is coming, but the dev said he is done with it. I have no personal interest in online multiplayer and it seems to be added just to flesh the game out because of the abysmally short campaign. Plus, multiplayer is d-e-a-d. It is not necessarily a bad game, but it does not justify it's base price."
Antihero,"Indie, Strategy","Pretty solid boardgame on pc, but definitely something that's more enjoyable played against other people than some stupid ai. I mean, it's a boardgame. Boardgames are generally meant to be played against other people rather than by yourself. Duh."
Automation - The Car Company Tycoon Game,"Indie, Racing, Simulation, Strategy, Early Access",very bad waste of money
Automation - The Car Company Tycoon Game,"Indie, Racing, Simulation, Strategy, Early Access","My dislike for this game is more of a failure to understand it.  It's something that has had a lot of work put into it, and it falls heavily into the hardcore simulation branch. I have to say that the UI is the single worst thing about the game,  and that's a problem.   Because 90% of your time is going to be navigating through menus at its core.  you have to design models, trims,   engine families,  and variants.  and I still haven't gotten the hang of it. this is definetley a ""dad game"".   I'll keep giving it a chance,  but I can't reccomend you jump into this unless you know what you're getting into.  It's definetley for big brains."
Battlefield™ V,Action,good enough to be fun
Battlefield™ V,Action,most of cheater in game are chinese
Battlefield™ V,Action,"As a Battlefield fan, i can say that this game is playable and enjoyable. But i remind you Battlefield V is probably the worst game of the series (may be hardline but nvm). If you are new to the Battlefield series, try go different games like Battlefield 1. (in 2021, when i write this review BF1 still has a player community). But if you love Battlefield and you are fan of the series, then you should absolutely play this game. But i prefer buying this game on sale otherwise you will waste a lot of money because of this sh*tty EA pricing thing. Have fun."
Battlefield™ V,Action,"Trash game. Not even worth playing when it's free. ModernWarfare has less hackers per minute than this garbage. Recoil is all over the place for first time users, which makes it even less enjoyable. Game is so vibrant and full of shadows and headglitches that you won't see or hear where you get shot from. I'm pretty sure I didn't see a setting to make ads relative to fov so everytime I ads it zooms in and you don't have any fov to react to people coming from the sides."
Battlefield™ V,Action,fun duo medic
Battlefield™ V,Action,"The most casual/easy of all the Battlefield games I've played. They definitely were trying to appeal to a wider, more casual audience with this one unfortunately. Also, all the unrealistic SJW ""diversity"" is incredibly annoying and almost all of your multiplayer characters are always defaulted to women soldiers when you first start the game. Also, as if that wasn't already annoying enough, the chat is extremely censored and does not allow you to say words EA deems as naughty or ""controversial"". I thought this was an M rated game? Honestly, not worth supporting trash like this unless you can grab it on a deep sale for 5 bucks. For that price it's worth it if you just want a casual multiplayer shooter to kill time with."
Battlefield™ V,Action,"Lol, I didn't realise that you are forced to play german nazis in this game. What's next, playing poor KKK guy cause ""suffering is the same in every language""?"
Battlefield™ V,Action,"After going back and forth between Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042 Battlefield V looks like a masterpiece now despite the game is still Hackersfield. Great job EA DICE Edit: DICE finally add a working anti cheat, if youre looking for the last decent battlefield, BFV probably be it even in the future. just dont get it at full price Edit: and there we go another useless anti cheat by EA"
Battlefield™ V,Action,Literally the worst BF game ever.
Battlefield™ V,Action,"its m,iud"
Beholder,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy","Potentially great game bogged down with terrible mechanic choices. Game is in real time and the quests have time limits. Natural habit is to try to complete quests as fast and effective as one could, but this game requires stalling quests as long as possible to progress to the certain game events later. It is impossible to know it beforehand though, so either you savescum like crazy or you play the mechanics not the game itself and just cheese your way out of it. It's a great shame cause this game have a potential to be better version of papers please, just the weird time management choices forcing you to replay certain sequences in search for perfect activities rotation killed it for me."
Beholder,"Adventure, Indie, Strategy","Скажу честно, играть в Beholder мне ощутимо мешало чувство мерзости, я вырос в 80-е и был воспитан так, что доносчик обычно получал первым. Густая атмосфера игры буквально пропитана духом антиутопий Оруэлла и Хаксли, но самое страшное, что легко проводятся параллели с современным обществом. Первый признак болезненности государства, это принятие антиконституционных законов и наглое вмешательство в личную жизнь своих граждан. Управлять преступниками несоизмеримо проще, а если человек не совершает противоправных дел, то можно их выдумать. Абсурд ситуации, что это не наше будущее, а реальность. Большой брат уже не просто выбирает наш вектор развития, но и назидательно определяет группы лиц, делая их изгоями, в угоду политических амбиций. Мрачный тон повествования и силуэты персонажей наглядно демонстрирует, что это может случиться в любом обществе, и поэтому становится страшно. Beholder симулятор гражданского служащего, который в любом случае, защищая себя или государство ломает судьбы. И вся эта серьёзность подана увлекательным и поучительным тоном - 8.0 баллов"
Beholder 2,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't after you.
Beholder 2,"Adventure, Indie, Simulation, Strategy","Another dystopic game from Warm Lamp Games in Beholder universe. This time, your character works in a ministry and the game makes you grasp the spirit of the bureaucracy. Both atmosphere and writing (mostly sarcastic and pretty dark) is like the first game, so if you liked the first one, probably you will like this one too. As gameplaywise, it has mini-games for daily jobs, some old-school text-adventure parts for going around, a little bit of self-developmental skill system and for the rest of the game, adventure style playstyle. Unfortunately, mini-games explained insufficiently and it makes it a bit hard to adjust but they are not particularly hard. However, you can do great at them without understanding what to do. Still, these games offer some variety for the game. There are lots of endings to choose from but the gameplay has almost no impact to these endings which means your moral choices don’t matter at the end. And of course, game has some great references to dystopias and first Beholder game."

Blacksad: Under the Skin,Adventure,"Blacksad is a an homage to many detective stories, even games such as LA Noire, but it focused too much on UI but not UX, the cinematography is great but the developer thought it was a movie, not a game which are both totally different artforms. It doesn't even allow you to change controls and its badly optimized for PC, the game's plot has so much petential though, if it was a bit lighter and fast paced, its the top games for me in story, even the voice acting is good ~ DIFFICULTY ~ 🔲 My 90 year old grandma could play it 🔲 Easy 🔲 Normal ✅ Hard 🔲 Dark Souls ~ GRAPHICS ~ 🔲 MS Paint 🔲 Bad 🔲 Meh 🔲 Graphics don't matter in this game 🔲 Good ✅ Beautiful 🔲 Masterpiece ~ MUSIC ~ 🔲 Bad ✅ Not special 🔲 Good 🔲 Beautiful ~ STORY ~ 🔲 This game has no story 🔲Like playing Temple Runners for the story 🔲It's there for the people who want it ✅ Well written 🔲 Epic story 🔲 Imagine Kingdom Hearts but on crack ~ PRICE ~ 🔲 Free 🔲 Underpriced ✅ Perfect Price 🔲 Could be cheaper 🔲 Overpriced 🔲 Complete waste of money (It was free on Epic) ~ REQUIREMENTS ~ 🔲 You can run it on a microwave 🔲Average ✅ High end 🔲 NASA computer ~ LENGTH ~ 🔲 Very Short (0 - 2 hours) 🔲Short (2 - 15 hours) ✅ Average (15-50 hours) 🔲 Long (50-90 hours) 🔲 Extremely long (90-110 hours) 🔲 No ending ~ FUN ~ 🔲 I'd rather watch paint dry ✅ Hard to enjoy 🔲 Repetitive 🔲 Actually pretty amusing 🔲The kind of fun you'll remember 🔲 Ride of your life ~ REPLAYABILITY~ 🔲 It's a one-time experience ✅ Only for achievements 🔲 If you wait a few months/years 🔲 Definitely 🔲 Infinitely replayable ~ WORTH BUYING ~ 🔲 No ✅ Wait for sale 🔲 Yes"
Blacksad: Under the Skin,Adventure,"I love Blacksad, have all the comic books at home, read them several times etc... the game is nice ok but it's a horrible port, the controls suck, the character doesnt run and there are several UI related issues etc. Buy it on serious sale."
Blacksad: Under the Skin,Adventure,"It's truly awesome game. Desmond O'Leary totally rules and Jake Ostombe is just the best. Also, ""We cats and wolves hunt at night"" 9+/10"

Brawlhalla,"Action, Indie, Free To Play","Совсем недавно мне посоветовали поиграть в игру Brawlhalla. Это 2d файтинг в мультиплеере. Основная задача этой игры скинуть противника с арены. Но для этого нужно попотеть, так как в этой игре набивается скилл, скилллвых игроков победить достаточно трудно. Наиграл я в эту игру совсем немного, но с уверенностью могу сказать что это шедевр. И так, начну более подробный рассказ об игре. В ней присутствует довольно неплохое количество персонажей, у которых имеется своё оружие и способности. Всего в игре их 38, но новых разработчики добавляют часто. Героев можно покупать за игровую валюту и за донат. Сама по себе игра бесплатная. Но на что жить разработчикам) Также в игре присутствует два режима игры. Обычный и ранговый, в котором можно получать деньги за которые надо покупать новое оружие. В обычных же боях, вы просто тренируетесь и также как и в ранговых получаете монеты, за которые покупаются новые герои. Присутствует система кланов, которая открывается с 15 уровня. Ну о чём знал, рассказал, теперь ваша очередь опробовать эту игру."

Call of Duty: World at War,Action,Great cod game 20/10
Call of Duty: World at War,Action,it goody
Call of Duty: World at War,Action,perfect game
Call of Duty: World at War,Action,.
Call of Duty: World at War,Action,Classic. The game that started nazi zombies. Epic campaign and great soundtrack.
Call of Duty: World at War,Action,this is great stuff
Call of Duty® (2003),Action,"Definitely worth getting, lengthy campaign that includes USA, United Kingdoms and Russia storyline's that blend together well - decent amount of weapon options If you've enjoyed playing COD World at War, you'll have no problem getting into this game, most gun models and reload animations are exactly the same in both games, but very different story modes Good music also, definitely fitting the theme of ww2. Btw there is no censorship regarding nazi symbols, in fact it's shown everywhere in the game in most if not all missions, so if that's something that offends you you've been warned. But it's accurate with the history. The only downside to this game, are some technical difficulties. Launching the game doesn't work, unless I do Ctrl+alt+delete and start task manager, and force close Cod. Then the game will launch the second try, and that's a consistent fix for the problem.  The other technical issue, is after closing the game, steam still thinks the game is open adding fake hours to your playtime. And since steam thinks the game is still playing, I couldn't play other games without restarting my computer entirely, if I only restarted Steam it would still think I was playing COD. They were pretty small issues, pretty annoying, however they did have a consistent solution for the issues. besides that, I'd definitely recommend this game for anyone who enjoys world war 2 FPS games"
Call of Duty® (2003),Action,"This is the original Game, the one that started all the fanboy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, dont get me wrong Call of Duty 1 was a great game. But loyalty means nothing to infinity ward. You can get this game on Xbox under the false name of ""Call of duty: Classic"" but this was born a PC game and shall remain. If it wasnt for this game and the PC community, Call of duty never would have become what it is today.  And I'm not saying that as if I like what it is today either. Personally I think the series was born, and died before it even made it to CoD 2"
Card Quest,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",Like a ...bad version of Slay the Spire. The game isn't terrible or bad even - but if something is better...why would you spend time with this?
Card Quest,"Indie, RPG, Strategy","This game is a hidden gem. Carefully craft your win-it-all strategy by combining numerous items and their associated sets of attacks. Just based on the atmosphere and the deck building mechanics I like it more than Slay the Spire and Roguebook, whereas it is similar to Bloodcard. Obiously, the game has its flaw. There are no real keyboard controls and some things lack explanation. For example ""Unaware"" prevents ""Dodge"". And what happens if my char is hidden? But that is also the cool part: Try it out and see what happens! I guess that is what makes the game so much fun for me."
Card Quest,"Indie, RPG, Strategy",Pretty decent card battler that is all about resource and combo management.  Trying to make the most of your tight little hand of 5 cards and limited stamina.
Card Quest,"Indie, RPG, Strategy","Fantastic deck-building game. As you clear areas you unlock items for 6 slots, each item adds a few cards or an ability you can use periodically. Each item is tied to one of the slots, and by mixing and matching you can heavily customize your deck. I found the game very hard until I realized that you need to play across the 3 different quests, not just focus on one. This allows you to clear the easy areas in all the quests to unlock more item options. One warning: while the art is good, you spend pretty much the whole game fighting enemy pictures on a black background. Outside of the theme of the cards/monsters and some quick text storytelling, you won't really see the world you're in. The combat mechanics and enemy design are tight and well crafted, you can dramatically change how your deck plays, and there's 4 characters with completely unique unlocks and playstyles. I've had a ton of fun with this game, and I'm definitely going to keep playing until I unlock everything. If you like card based games, you really owe it to yourself to check this one out."
Castle Itter - The Strangest Battle of WWII,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy","Puzzle. Addictive. Played it 8 times in a row my first sitting. Designed as a solo experience. The board game is $50+ on eBay. If you figure out how the tank is not just a suicide mission, I really want to know. True historical WWII battle. Real people. Their actual names and photos. A strange battle indeed. War is crazy as hell."
Castle Itter - The Strangest Battle of WWII,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Awesome game! :D
Close Combat: The Bloody First,"Simulation, Strategy",Game of elevations and line of sight with AI that force you to manually check elevations and line of sight for each squad every 5 seconds. Also - really awkward UI and controls. Bleak and washed out colour palette of the map and your squads does not help with maintaining control over your troops positions.
Close Combat: The Bloody First,"Simulation, Strategy",No just no. Obsolete graphics with horrible UI.
Colt Canyon,"Action, Casual, Indie, RPG","A real fun stylish western roguelite twin stick shooter.  You'll be running through the level looking for ammo and blasting baddies as you head down the road to rescue your kidnapped significant other.  There is a great variety in characters (primarily different stats and starting equipment), weapons, and baddies (including very tough bosses).  I find I really love/hate the game's tight ammo supply.  It keeps thing tense and often has you using non-optimal weapons as they might be the only ones you still have ammo for at the moment.  Also, since you can only carry 2 weapons at a time, the game really forces you to carefully weigh which ones you'll equip (and, nicely, as the game allows backtracking into previously cleared levels on a run, you're still free to switch back to any weapons you might have discarded earlier on the trail)."
Colt Canyon,"Action, Casual, Indie, RPG","Really fun, and co-op is great. 8/10 However, here are a couple of things that can be improved: 1) Bolder colors and the ability to change the colors under your character would be nice. I  get confused between my character and my friend's character while playing co-op sometimes, especially when things get chaotic. 2) I hate how you need to use ammo and/or health to purchase items from the trader. The addition of money for purchases would be great."
DRAGON BALL FighterZ,Action,Only matches makes my self esteem hit rock-bottom.
DRAGON BALL FighterZ,Action,got ♥♥♥♥ on like 4 or 6 times in a row in ranked by the same dude but it was fun
Darksiders II Deathinitive Edition,"Action, Adventure, RPG","The Hack-N-Slash element and animations still hold up today. Play this if you want a classic power fantasy, button-mash, and 3rd-person Hack-N-Slash. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the protagonist's dry non-cringe-worthy retorts and general badass-ery."
Darksiders II Deathinitive Edition,"Action, Adventure, RPG","An excellent remaster that fixes what many users complained about when the original launched: HD textures, a different lighting engine (which may be subject to preference, as it is more realistic than before and thus things aren't as glowy anymore), DLC integrated into the main game, and plenty of fixes as well as rebalancing of enemies and gear. Honestly, this upgrade is worth it for the highly detailed textures and new environmental effects alone. If you've never played Darksiders II, this version is excellent for you, too. It includes all DLC content previously available and runs smooth on modern systems - even on my old (and hopefully soon to be replaced) AMD5750 graphics card, it runs just about the same as the original did, at a drastic increase in visual fidelity. Overall, I am very pleased. Finally the game looks like the artists intended it to originally, but weren't able to realize before. It is well worth picking up."
Darksiders II Deathinitive Edition,"Action, Adventure, RPG",I like this game very much.
Darksiders II Deathinitive Edition,"Action, Adventure, RPG","Sequel continues from first game’s story but you play as a different horseman (Death). However, this time you only do some fetch quests and bounty quests. Every character you see mocks Death or give him something to do for themselves. Since you know the story from the first game, you only learn about Death and his backstory which isn’t much. So, you will probably go into some dungeons and solve puzzles while doing platforms without caring about story. DLC campaigns only give you some short dungeons with same enemies out of the blue. There are some variety about platforming and puzzle aspect of the game but it is over-used. For that reason, that part feels like a chore after a while. Game is a bit more like an open world game and there some side quests in it. Although there isn’t much to do in this open world and side quest mostly collection quests; these quests are annoying even with a guide (there is no checklist in game for it). There is a new game+ option after finishing the game but I don’t know why someone would like to do that. First playthrough is pretty soulless and repetitive by itself already. What about combat though? It should be the most important part of the game, right? Unfortunately, no. There aren’t many combos or moves, combat is repetitive and there isn’t much of a variety of enemies, except the paint jobs of different enemies. Sadly, boss fights don’t compensate for these too and the Reaper form feels pretty weak. And most of the battles are against camera angles or bad viewpoints. Morever, locking into a big enemy doesn't help you at all. There are couple of skills to level up (not so much) and some gear to drop. Most of the gear you will find be useless and since money is mostly useless, selling them wouldn’t be useful either. By the way, there is no explanation about stats or weapons’ specials; so, good luck figuring them out by yourself. Lastly, bugs: Game is a huge bugfest. I encountered every kind of it; crash, visual, audio, unresponsive game, puzzles. Let me summarize them for you quickly: Game can crash sometimes and there is nothing you can do about it.  Other than that, graphics looks pixelated in modern systems while audio will partially disappear more you play or you change into additional campaigns. Sometimes your character won’t move if you press escape and you will be forced to restart the game. Additional campaigns have some broken puzzles; some may require you to restart, some will need a work around to solve it. As you can understand, this game is a mess and it is half finished (basically another AAA game). It isn’t worth the time you spent unless you are a huge fan of this genre or series."
Darksiders II Deathinitive Edition,"Action, Adventure, RPG","Game is completely broken, crash, stutters, voice lines glitching, crashes everytime I change any option in the options menu. Is it good? Yea, it is, a lot. Does it work? Nope."
Deadlight: Director's Cut,"Action, Adventure","It's decent, I would lean more on a mixed review, but besides the broken saves nothing really bothered me and It's fun once you get the weapons."

Drug Dealer Simulator,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Simulation",I kinda got the gist of the game very quickly and don't care to play more. Just feels like fetch quests the game.
Drug Dealer Simulator,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Simulation",Attempted to sue an indie dev for making a better game. Never buying from this dev again. GO BUY SCHEDULE 1
Drug Dealer Simulator,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Simulation","Slinging dope and fighting the Law I know what you're thinking ""oh another gimmicky simulator about a random occupation"". And to be honest you are partially right. Yes the game is a sim about dealing drugs and out running the law. But the game feels like more then just that. The game has personality that I can almost compare to Postal and despite it looking like an asset flip I would call it an asset flip with character. For what I have been told there's no plans of adding combat to the game (which was advertised in the trailer) and I do feel a little mixed on that since it would add an extra layer to being a drug runner. One thing I would like added is an option to pass time like resting at home (to skip the police hours sometimes). Overall its a good time waster thats worth the money"
"Dude, Stop","Adventure, Casual, Indie","This game is pretty fun with its original content. There is much to say about it actually. It is a meta-fictional, anti-game type of short game which has some puzzles to solve to complete game. There was nothing negative in this game for me. So, I definitely recommend it."

DungeonTop,"Indie, Strategy","Good combat, excellent replay variance, many viable deck build options. If you're interested in this game I highly recommend it. I usually don't go for grid combat games but this one is very well done. Fast paced but not shallow, with fantastic enemy variety to keep you on your toes strategically. There are plenty of starter deck options plus lots of viable ways to build your deck throughout your run. Replaying the game feels fun and fresh after several full runs and I fully expect to sink many more hours into it. This game was a really pleasant surprise. If it looks like your kind of thing you should give it a go."
DungeonTop,"Indie, Strategy","Yes, I would recommend this game to other players."
ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,"My review is considered neutral. I have played 3 major 4X space games over the past 3 or 4 years,  Stellaris, Galactic Civilizations and ES. Endless Space 2 is by far my least favorite of the three. very comparable to Galactic Civilizations 3,  ES2 has better production quality, cool background/lore.  but few customization options and most jarringly I think the issue with ES vs Stellaris and GalCiv is it's UI is very out of whack. I don't know what it is,  but after playing Civ, Galciv, and Stellaris,  I just dont like this game all that much."
ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,"Endless Space 2 continues with the asymmetrical gameplay of Endless Legend to create a game with a great deal more replayability than Civilization, the game I think it is most similar to.  Every race has very different mechanics for things like how they colonize new worlds or how they use resources, and it results in feeling like you get 8 games in one.  Even better than Endless Legend, these different mechanics don't force you so much into a particular playstyle because once you've started you can do a lot tinkering with the race's government and techs to fit the play style you need for your situation.  This is why it is a better game than Civilization, in my opinion.  Because you have such control over what your alien race is and how they deal with the universe both among themselves and in interacting with the unknown. It possibly gets over complicated at time.  If you're just pressing end turn waiting for something to be built or a tech to be researched, you're probably missing out on a great deal of choice.  Your civilization includes your starting race and alien refugees who have settled on your worlds.  Shuffling the populations around between planets and later systems, and encouraging some to reproduce more rapidly is just some of the ways you can what your civilization is and how efficient it is.  But by the late game you have a quite a lot of worlds to manage and it can start to being a micromanagement chore. Diplomacy was quite simple when the game came out, but it has become a lot more complex recently.  I do think the AI doesn't know so well, what's in its best interest here.  It seems to undervalue systems and overvalue techs.  But it's a lot of fun wheeling and dealing and putting pressure and demanding tribute from lesser civilations, eventually to consume them through politics or conquest.  (I generally prefer the former.) The tech tree is much improved from the former title in the series.  But it doesn't seem to tell you all the information you'd like to know, especially in the military portion of the tree.  What will this gun actually mean to the fire power of my ships relative to what they are currently at, can they equip them, how much does it cost, are all questions that seem out of reach.  similarly, it would be nice to highlight techs that you can use easily.  such as, show me only techs that have to do with resources I have. Economy is interesting but another area that is poorly explained.  You can make a lot of money (dust in the game) by buying and selling luxury resources on the market and the game does tend to alert you when this is a good idea.  you can also set up trade routes which take a lot of time and resources and are a bit of a gamble because your trade ships can be easily destroyed often before they've paid for themselves.  I suppose it is more like commerce from the old days in that respect.  But here too, how much each trade you get earns for each trip is never told.  So, when you see the price increase for each new one go up, you have a hard deciding whether it is worth it.  Just in general this lack of specifics in places where there's no reason for it not to be is a problem. Which brings me to the final problem  there really needs to be an ingame almanac or manual.  There is an out of game manual, but it doesn't have specifics of how the systems work, either, and it is out of date, since quite a lot has been added to the game since launch.  I highly recommend Endless Space 2, but as a new player, you may not like it.  The game is all about preparation.  You have to have put some work into every aspect of managing your civilization before it you run into problems, so you can solve them before they arise, and it's nearly impossible to do that when some times you don't even know that the mechanics are in place to solve them in the first place.  I remember even just conducting a siege involved knowing about ground troops and upgrading them and man power and all kinds of info, that's hidden away on subscreens. You may even think you've research the proper tech, like tanks, but there's they are going to do no good for you if you don't know where to go to add the tanks to your armies or how to upgrade them and what would be a good proportion of tanks to infantry to bombers by seeing the positives and negatives of each one.  So, you will lose and have to restart the game and start planning earlier the next time.  and this will keep happening because after learning about sieges there will be something else like politics that screws you in the next game.  But eventually you'll start to get the picture and you'll realize this is the most detailed 4X game yet."
ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,"Its not as groundbreaking as Endless Space 1 felt, but its a very solid 4X space game."
ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,"Quite a challenging game, although the diplomacy still needs a lot to improve, the game's system is better than the other 4X strategies, I think it's only competitor is Stellaris right now. A simple decision can change your entire outcome, a single research not made can mean battles won or lost. The whole cinematic replay thing is also awesome, wish they would give us RTS control in those battles too, still watching your ships battle realtime is awesome. Resource management, trading and the whole development mechanics I think are better than it's competing titles. Definitely a must buy if you are into 4X space strategy."
ENDLESS™ Space 2,Strategy,"The hype for Endless Space 2 was great before the release. This usualy brings some justified suspicion on the costumers side as many times in the past games that were eagerly expected turned out big flukes. But ES2 managed to avoid this pattern. The game is not only a worthy sequel but it came out well polished as well. This is important as many devs and studios prefer to just release the sequels that seem and feel half finished and then try to catch up in DLC land. The game delivers in all its promises and it delivers in a balanced way. There isnt any feeling that some aspect of the game carry more wight than others although there are factors that indeed, in specific circumstances, matter more. This series has potential. As long as the devs keep on listening to the community and have the ability to synthesise the many different ideas, ES will have many succesfull sequels."

Entropy : Zero 2,"Action, Free To Play","Probably the best Half Life related mod to come out in a long time. It feels so new and fun to play. Just having a kick whenever you need instead of switching weapons is a great tool in many situations and you start to appreciate kicking. The guns have nice models and great animations. The models themselves are really good. The game play is really fun and smooth. Its awesome to play the bad guy! My favorite part had to be escorting the target, something about good and bad both not wanting to cooperate with each other but having to in order to escape death was cool to me. Not to mention the Epistle 3 references. It's worth your time especially since it's free. If It gets some recognition by valve that'd be awesome as it really deserves it!"

Fallout New Vegas: Honest Hearts,"Action, RPG",Worst DLC for me. I do not like caves and losing myself in the canyon. Plus I do not understand how can a tribal with a light armor can be so tanky or hit that much with a spear. Story is pretty bad too. It is only buyable with the bundle.

Galaxy Squad,Strategy,"So that was my 1st playthrough. Yes it was a short one, cause I didn't expect some things to happen without spoiling, it was the first planet i went for. I like that things happening on the way, very different events. I like the sound, it made me more into the game. its nice to travel and go for things sse what will be next. Maybe you find pirates, maybe your ship got hit. You never know. I don't have real -/- cause its made very clear, ingame also,  its still been working on. Ofc we want more, weapons, more armor, more more more ,I think the developer knows all that and it will come with time. If there would be something maybe could be that when you buy things in the shop, that would be nice to see your squad to compare if I need something. I recommend for me. For you I don't know. I just wanted something abit lighter for next to my heavy strategy thinking games. I think its relax to play. Yes my squad blown all up was relax. GG. Next playthrough"
Galaxy Squad,Strategy,"Like a nice simple mix of X-COM and FTL. Not perfectly balanced and a little easy, but fun combat and overall a very nice game for a very fair price. You go from star to star having random encounters (mostly combat) while an invincible fleet closes out the galaxy behind you. The combat is very X-COM, turn based with abilities and cover and hit chance, enemies generally don't start acting until you get in their sight radius. I found the hardest difficulty to be pretty easy, and I imagine turn based veterans will find it the same. Combat is very fun, with a fantastic variety of enemies and a good variety of victory conditions. The player unit classes and abilities are fun to use as well, although some class/ship abilities are so good they seem almost mandatory. There's some replay value from the branching story, and unlocking more gear, classes, game modes, etc. It probably took me 40 hours to finish all the story variants and try all the game modes. If you use a guide or rush you could definitely get there faster than that. If you want an enjoyable fast-playing X-COM clone with a galaxy progression similar to FTL, and you don't mind the fact that it may not be very challenging, then I completely recommend this game at full price. I had a great time with it."

Gloomhaven,"Adventure, RPG, Strategy",No no no
Gloomhaven,"Adventure, RPG, Strategy","This is one of the worst games I have ever played in my life. From a tutorial that is incredibly insulting, to a bad UI that puts an exclamation point ON THE ITEMS I JUST ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BOUGHT, to the SLOW AS BALLS gameplay, to the idiotic battle system. I don't understand how anyone can find this enjoyable unless they are a masochist. The entire battle system where you burn your abilities (Including basic attacks and movements) and then have this half card BS feels like it was designed just to be different. It suffers from a game built around a mechanic, rather than a mechanic built around the game. =============== ""HI!!!!!! DIS IS DAH SHIELD U JUST BOUGHT!!!!! U KNOW IN CASE U FORGOT WITHIN THE SPAN OF TWO SECONDS!!! I PUT AN EXLAMATION POINT ON IT THAT WUNT GO WAYZ TILL U MAKE IT LULZ!!!"" Seriously.....I died a little inside when I saw this....How dumb do you need to be to think this is a good idea? I can understand things I LOOT, but things I just bought??? That is like me buying a can of beans at the grocery store....and an employee immediately walking up to me and informing me I just bought a can of beans....then refusing to leave until I verify with them that it is, indeed, a can of beans......and this happens for everything I put in my cart... ================= <Sorceress collapses and dies> Player: ""Um, my sorc just randomly died?"" DM:""Yeah, she's dead."" Player: ""Why?"" DM: ""She ran out of abilities, so she is dead now."" Player: ""Wtf? She just collapses and dies?!?!"" DM: ""Yeah, she's dead now."" Player: ""But she had full health...."" DM: ""Not anymore."" Player: ""But, couldn't she just like.....rest or something?"" DM: ""No, everyone dies when they run out of cards. Your tank just died too, from exhaustion."" Player: ""But...he stood still half the fight and did nothing..."" DM: ""And now he's dead."" This was my first and last battle playing this game. I wish I knew if they came back after the battle was over...but I uninstalled before finding out."
Gloomhaven,"Adventure, RPG, Strategy","I enjoy the innovative gameplay.  One of the game's biggest gimmicks is that each card has a top and bottom action, and during each turn you'll play 2 cards from your hand BUT must use different parts of the cards (i.e. you can't use 2 top or 2 bottom options).  This creates a lot of tension as you'll often have to essentially burn a card for a sub-standard option if you want to use a key option on the other card.  Cards played aren't completely lost, for the most part, but you'll be paying a high price to bring them back from the discard pile, so you can't really rely on getting favorite cards right back in your hand."
Gloomhaven,"Adventure, RPG, Strategy",Gloomhaven is a huge game IRL. This port to computer is ... i mean ... There is love in this game ... No word...
Gloomhaven,"Adventure, RPG, Strategy","Hassle-free experience compared to the physical boardgame. Sure, there's been quite a few issues and bugs with various skills and combinations, not to mention the ~100 scenarios in the game that work really nicely as a campaign where you get to choose your path with your party. Yet the monthly (?) updates seem to turn the game better and better month after month. Playing the same campaign with the same group of friends and 69 hours later we have perhaps cleared 25-33% of the content on our campaign trip. Enjoyable experience and what's best - you can easily play another game on a second screen while waiting your turn and chatting with your friends. Vampire Survivors and Mainframe Defenders being good choices for that. :) The only real downside is that Gloomhaven is quite ...puzzleish generally, which you might not understand initially. I personally don't like it and would prefer more ...hack & slash-approach."
Growth,"Casual, Indie, Simulation, Strategy","Fun and chill strategy/puzzle game that is probably too easy if you're looking for a challenge. I really liked the atmosphere and theme and the way carefully choosing my approach allowed me to progress through the map. I'm not a frequent puzzle gamer and after my first try I was able to beat it consistently. If it's only challenge you're after this is not the game for you. But if you want a pleasant and relaxing puzzle to play for an hour or two here and there, this is a very nice option."
Growth,"Casual, Indie, Simulation, Strategy","I'm really enjoying this game with my only knock at this point being, even though it is a neat highscore chasing puzzle game, it doesn't appear to track my top local score."

Guild of Dungeoneering Ultimate Edition,"Indie, RPG","Lost a dungeon crawl to the ritual BS because I could not get any proper corridor tiles to path there. Lost it a second time because my dumb ♥♥♥♥ of a Ranger kept going after level 2s as a level 4 instead of the level 3 enemy I put on the objective tile (There were no lower lvl enemies showing up). An AI that prioritizes anything over the objective goal is one of the dumbest things I've seen in over 15 years of gaming. Whoever made that decision, or the idiot that designed the level 3 ritual dungeon where you lose in X turns needs to GTFO the industry. I sincerely hope you DIAF and don't breed before doing so."

Hand of Fate 2,"Action, Indie, RPG",For some god forsaken reason they decided to keep the idiotic card shuffle mechanic in game.  I'll take the dice rolling any day over this stupidity.
Hand of Fate 2,"Action, Indie, RPG","The engaging mix of interesting choose your own adventures and deck building return in this sequel, and added to it are an overarching story and a new combat system.  The new combat system was difficult for me to get the feel of at first.  it's much harder to block in this game than in the first one because if you have pressed attack before you pressed defend, your defend will not override it.  Essentially, you must wait until your attack animation is completed before you press your next button. I think it's good that it's different, because there was only ever skill required in the boss fights in the original game.  But it does have the effect of making the combat seem slow. I am surprised at how much I like this series.  The generic fantasy setting wouldn't appeal to me at all from a distance but once I'm actually playing it reminds me more of Lone Wolf or Conan than it does of Lord of the Rings, which is something to be thankful for, and often there is some inspiration in the creature designs.  My favorite has to be the mages from the first game with their spellbooks open and mounted to their armor.  Also, unlocking cards is so fun.  It lets you progress even when you fail the overall mission.  And that allows the game to be more difficult but not to frustrate the player."

Hard West,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy","Very interesting game: nice graphic and excellent atmosphere and story... However their customer assistance is the incredibly good: I had a problem of frequent crashes to desktop that made the game unplayable. I contacted the customer service without any hope but instead they answered very quickly and very politely, reading my email and framing immediately the problem: they answered me to insert a couple of lines in a .conf file in /etc (I am on linux) and... it worked!

Life is Strange - Episode 1,"Action, Adventure","The good: good storytelling, unique concept, nice soundtrack, makes you think about choices and the effect they have in real life. The bad: overly dramatic voice acting (especially from the lead character), hours of weepy teenage melodrama, some sections go on too long, the little choices don't matter, feels too cinematic for too long at times with many minutes of not interacting with the game at all. Overall Life is Strange is a good, if overrated, game. It has glaring faults, especially in the final episode, and I didn't quite get the emotional kick from it many others did. I found the characters incredibly whiney at times and the voice acting on the lead character to be overly emotional on everything. *In a shaky whispery voice choking up* ""yes... I'm, I'm going to take a high fibre dump now... then eat.. ba ba bacon and eggs"". I played the episodes all at once in a row, maybe this wouldn't have come across so annoying if I had played it as it was released originally. Some parts had me going, ""okay, I get it, it's all very weepy and sad, call a whambulance, can I play the game again now please?"" I give the game 6/10. Worth playing for the storytelling and interesting concept, but definitely has its flaws."
Life is Strange - Episode 1,"Action, Adventure",boring
Life is Strange - Episode 1,"Action, Adventure",perfec game
Life is Strange - Episode 1,"Action, Adventure","Dear god, talk about First World Problems the video game. This game has an interesting premise but so far, for me anyway, an 18 year old male who's finished high school, the execution so far leaves alot to be desired. I hadn't heard of this game until it came out, and I watched the trailers and thought  ""Hey, this looks kind of cool, it's like Brick mixed with Donnie Darko with a female protagonist"". It's more like Juno mixed with Donnie Darko at this point. Except without the pregnant main character. Essentially, you play as a female photography student in her late teens who discovers she has the abillity to reverse time. There are good characters in this game, and there are characters that appear to have some personality and actual problems, but so far the ""le wrong generation"" time traveling hipster you play as isn't one of them. Maybe that's the point and I just don't get this game. There hasn't been much plot so far, just alot of foreshadowing and character development. It's obvious that there is something not quite right going on here but we aren't told too much. That's not the problem. There's nothing wrong in having your plot take awhile to unravel. Introducing  your characters and your world through normal interraction and conversation (Well, normal considering you can find out what someone wants to hear and go back in time and tell them that), but it's not fun when every character has some kind of issue that's instantly apparent. There's the girl whos nudes have appeared online and shes bullied for it, the girl whos pregnant, the girl whos boyfriend is cheating on her, the girl whos step dad hits her. As said above, these people do have real issues. I'm not saying these people should just suck it up. What I'm saying is the writers shouldn't make every character you meet so miserable. Like I said, maybe this is because I'm an 18 year old male who doesn't go on tumblr and doesn't dress like someone from the 90s and I just don't ""get"" this game. But so far, to me anyway, it's a lot of wasted potentional. That said, there's still four more episodes to go, and I plan to play every one. Maybe it will get better. I'm hoping it does, because it's premise does still have me intrigued. [EDIT] I couldn't bring myself to play anymore of this game so I watched the rest of it on YouTube. It doesn't get better. At one point, your ""friend"" Chloe, probably the most irredeemable character in gaming history, murders a man and his dog in cold blood because she didn't want to pay him money that she owed him. It just keeps getting worse from there. Don't make my mistake, don't buy this ♥♥♥♥ game."
Life is Strange - Episode 1,"Action, Adventure","One of the best, most emotionally poignant ""Telltale-like"" story games I've played in years. 9/10, the only thing bringing down the score are some gamey sections in the later episodes."
Life is Strange - Episode 1,"Action, Adventure","Necessary procedure to play this game 1) Prepare a box of tissues 2) Wipe your tears and get mind-blown 3) Stare at an empty side of your room,thinking you had underestimate the game 4) Make a wish you could turn back time like Max to re-experience this game in blank slate 5) post a hella review for the mosh pit, shaka-brah. And oh yeah,go-tassium and go ape!"
Life is Strange - Episode 1,"Action, Adventure","One of the most amazing, emotionally moving and well written adventure games I've ever played. I can only wish it was even longer and had more and more details... The soundtracks are also amazing."
Life is Strange - Episode 1,"Action, Adventure",Was it worth it to let all people die to save my bff? Hella yes.
Life is Strange 2,Adventure,"Eghhh what the hell was this now, full of anti-Trump references and ""evil white people"" BS. What a waste of money. I was hoping to enjoy it like the first game instead I got myself a bunch of ""woke"" propaganda."
Life is Strange 2,Adventure,perfect game
Life is Strange 2,Adventure,"I feel empty. Traumatized. I'm completely different now. I played the whole series, now I don't know what to do with my life. I feel completely useless. It was a great time. But this game put it to another level. I never felt anything like this in a game. Thanks for this lifelesson game"
Life is Strange 2,Adventure,"Warning for spoilers. Even though I loved the first two Life is Strange games this game was definitely not for me. I had a hard time finishing it and I procrastinated it for a long time (like a year). At first, I thought that I did not have the mindset but at the third chapter I realized that game was the problem. Writing is really bad and it is not remotely interesting. Characters are really shallow and most of them are really one sided. The little brother was really annoying and repulsive, and it felt like a chore to talk to him for the most of the time. Also, the side characters were much worse than him. Game constantly forces the certain people are racist narrative. Literally every single chapter has a racist right-wing antagonist with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stereotype (religious people, even with a church to burn down, multiple hillbillies, cops and border vigilantes at the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wall) except the third chapter which was the most playable chapter for me. The left-wing characters are the same. They are extreme and annoying for the most part. At last chapter there is a guy who says he left his kids and wife, after coming out as a gay man and blames the family for not being okay for being him gay (marrying a woman without even being attracted to hear, making multiple children, all being a lie). Weirdly, it is expected people to be okay with marrying someone without even being remotely attach to a person a start a family, then saying it is not good for me, leaving the family, starting a relationship with a man in a hippie lifestyle while it is being commented as being “brave”. Plus, there are some weird commentaries about “being a real patriot”, because there is a pride flag with American flag. Most of the “good guys” from the game sound like that unfortunately. Another example being a journalist which had rich parents and he lives on the road not being part of the family fortune, since they are cynical people, while researching nudist people. Sadly, they did not even try to create a decent character or story which brings us to the main point of the story: If there is a criminal activity and you are not white, you will go to the jail. Even the one of the endings supports this idea which makes absolutely no sense, there is no evidence for them to be charged. All of the endings are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ than next one and again do not make any sense. Other than that, the choices are really bad in this game. They do not matter and no impact on the story, since every chapter has some different forgettable character and still the game gives you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ options; like stealing, normalizing a mother who leaves two children (one of them is a baby), because she was “bored” (you are forced to make up with her) or running away from the cops for no reason. I felt the hate while I was playing the game but it was not about the racism against a minority group, it was hate against another group of people. Lastly, I do not know how the developers have the audacity to lecture other people openly with this kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ writing, especially being French and making a game about racism in USA while selling it worldwide. Talk about being hypocritical and looking down to people. Most of the people do not play games to be lectured, they play them to have a nice time and this game’s aim is certainly not it."
Life is Strange 2,Adventure,YES half life 2 has a really good  soundtrack and gameplay also i love the story of the two brothers who are on their own journey
Luck be a Landlord,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Good goofy fun with my only whine being lack of any meta stat tracking...but that was no longer an issue once I beat the first floor...
Luck be a Landlord,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy","I don't like slot machines but I really enjoyed this game. It's more like a deckbuilder where you pull 20 cards per turn. Fun, fast paced, clever."
Luck be a Landlord,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy","This is a borderline review. The game is fun and has some interesting concepts, but it is a bit repetitive, buggy, and overpriced for what it is. Hopefully as the game gets improved it will change to a ""thumbs up"" ... but as it stands the sheer number of crashes I've had and other issues say ""wait until it is on sale and more polished"" before buying. EDIT: The game does have potential and I hope he makes it more interesting with better synergies and choices, but it is pretty formulaic at the moment. At higher difficulty levels it is all about just getting lucky early drops in symbols and items that work together. Looking forward to seeing what is done with the game, but for now just wait. EDIT2: Okay, I changed from Negative to Positive due to most of the major bugs being fixed that recently cropped up. I'd still advise people to either way for it to go on sale or to try the demo and if you REALLY like it then get it."
Luck be a Landlord,"Indie, Simulation, Strategy",Essentially a perfect game. There's no meaningless fluff - just gameplay. And oh boy does that gameplay keep giving!
METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES,"Action, Adventure",Played demos longer than this
METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES,"Action, Adventure",this game is a piece of ♥♥♥♥
METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES,"Action, Adventure","This is hard to recommend, but if you're at all interested in the Main Game (The Phantom Pain), you probably should play this first. This is really something that should have been packaged with the main game as a prologue chapter. The games campaign is 40 minutes long without cutscenes and with the side missions it comes up to about 2 hours and 40 minutes total. But the game-play is so smooth that I just kept replaying as many times and as differently as a could and there's stuff I haven't discovered."
METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES,"Action, Adventure","it's fun, but selling a one mission from MGS V as a whole game is a scam..."
METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES,"Action, Adventure",METAL GEAR SOLID 5: GROUND IS MY FIRST METAL GEAR GAME ON PC AS I HAVE PLAYED THE OLD GAME ON MY PS3 LIKE THOSE OLD GAMES THIS GAME IS STILL A MASTERPIECE THOUGH THIS GAME IS SHORT AS THE MAIN STORYLINE OF THE GAME CONSIST OF ONLY ONE MISSION BUT YOU CAN TRY THE SIDE MISSIONS THEY ARE ALSO GOOD. THE SEQUEL TO THIS GAME IS METAL GEAR SOLID 5: PHANTOM PAIN WHICH I AM SURELY GONNA TRY THANKS TO HIDEO KOJIMA TO BRING SUCH MASTERPIECE GAMES TO US.
METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES,"Action, Adventure",steam said i bought this game 2 times. kewl
METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES,"Action, Adventure",This game is just tech a demo for the bigger game (MGSV)
METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES,"Action, Adventure",Short but fun
METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES,"Action, Adventure","A good Add-on to MGS 5 V to give more backstory to such a prestigious character, Big Boss."

Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne,Action,max is so depressed and horny lmao he's literally me
Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne,Action,somehow this game has both the best graphics and some of the best gameplay out of the entire ps2 catalogue
Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne,Action,Played it first time when I was 12 and when I saw this again on steam didn't thought twice to add it to my library. Enjoyed every bit of the the game and story. 10/10
Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne,Action,"Playing Max Payne 1 and 2 back to back really shows how huge the step up from first to second game is. Everything here is improved, graphics, gameplay, story, voice acting, gameplay. All the things I didn't like in the first one are exceptionally better here and the overall product feels much more polished. This was my first playthrough and I enjoyed it very much. The bonus is you don't have to install any 3rd party patches to get the game running without problems on new systems. I would recommend it to anybody interested in a 3rd person shooter with very good story."
Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne,Action,"Amazing sequel, just as good as the first game and the story continues where the first one left off 10/10 game"
Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne,Action,"Better than the first in most ways and runs pretty well, Story is good and the modding scene is huge. Needs a mod to enable widescreen resolutions, other than that it ran fine on my Modern AMD/Nividia system Apparently there is fixes for sound issues i have not experienced if you have any check the steam guides Grab it before rockstar rush remedy to release a broken half done game then de-list the originals like they have done before. i totally regret not buying the GTA trilogy before it was ""remastered"""

Medal of Honor™,Action,"First singleplayer game I ever played. Pros : - Great campaing, inspired by true events (Operation Anaconda); - Great and realistic gun playing and sounds; - Likeable characters; - Great atmosphere. Cons : - Has small bugs but aren't game crashing"
Medal of Honor™,Action,MEDAL OF HONOR WAS ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING GAMES OF ALL IT IS ONE OF BEST FIRST PERSON SHOOTING GAMES HAVING A REALLY GOOD AND SAD STORYLINE IN MY CASE I REALLY LOVED THIS GAME ONE OF THE BEST GAME BY ELECTRONIC ARTS
Medal of Honor™,Action,"Tried playing this thing's campaign, but besides being very generic, it kept crashing on air strike parts. Thank god it was within refund's window."
Need for Speed™ Rivals,"Action, Adventure, Racing","I feel the need, the need to drive around town. --what is it?-- It's a driving game, in a arcade style. You get to choose from 3 different objectives to complete during a race, that suits your style. When you complete the objectives, you unlock the next race and then keep on doing that again, pick a objective, have a race, and get some points to buy cars. You can choose to be the cops or not cops. You get some additional helpful items that can benefit you in a race, such as boosters or spike strips. I was put off by the brownish colour tint the game seems to have for a while. As time went on, it was less noticable and it looked better and better the more cars I unlocked. But there is a serious lack of colour that originally was a eyesore. The car models are stunning. The cars handle a lot with the feeling that it's on rails, and if you are used to a more modern Need for speed title, it will feel like you are stuck on the road like glue. Mainly it has to do with the fact that the roads tend to only go one way. You get a weird feeling that you are stuck on a highway. There's never any areas to stop, with crossroads, alleys or traffic lights, or a place to turn into any other street that's connected to it. The whole map is all essentially one big loop. In addition to that the camera I think, that's not as flexible as the newer racing games The car handling does have it's own feel to it, that is very arcade like and the cars feel very heavy. It does take some getting used to, and once I completed it, was really enjoying it thoroughly, mainly because the handling improved drastically with the cars that you get to drive later on. There are a few other major negative points, in that you can't pause the game. Also the keyboard default controls were strange, and worst of all the refresh rate was stuck on 30fps, which felt borderline unplayable. Once that was fixed with a command line that didn't work for me in Steam command line, but once I added it in Origins command line it worked from there. Everything felt so much better, and I could finally enjoy the game."
Need for Speed™ Rivals,"Action, Adventure, Racing",i need for speed
OUTRIDERS,"Action, Adventure, RPG","Nope, it's too expensive and it's full of bugs and crashes constantly. On the other hand, the game is linear, the map is linear (definitely not open world),  the story is uninteresting and single player is IMPOSSIBLE you are forced to play with others, forget about free roaming by yourself."
OUTRIDERS,"Action, Adventure, RPG",lost connection to the servers during expeditions which are super ♥♥♥♥♥ hard at times even insane  uninstalled  no i dont recommend  this game i come back if u nerf the expeditions i aint ♥♥♥♥♥ with it and fix yr servers as well 4 months after still no content update lmao
OUTRIDERS,"Action, Adventure, RPG","Buggy and unoptimized even now, but if you can deal with it or happen to be one of the few lucky ones that doesn't encounter these issues then there is a lot of fun to be had here. Great/satisfying gore, fun Gears of War like game play, decent graphics, and the characters/story have that dark and rough/tough look and vibe that the old GoW trilogy story and characters had. Definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of GoW and 3rd person shooters, though I highly suggest playing it coop and having the difficulty scale with your characters or it will probably be too easy, makes it much more fun. The only cons I personally had were ofcourse the bugs/optimization, sometimes the game play can get a little repetitive after a while, and finally I felt like you got way too much loot. This final con was especially annoying if you're playing on the highest difficulty that scales with you because you are almost constantly getting better gear which really takes away from the excitement you get when you have just found some really good loot. I felt like I was always switching out my weapons and armor because I was almost constantly getting something better. My score: 7/10"
OUTRIDERS,"Action, Adventure, RPG","A looter shooter without the live service BS This scratches my mindless loot-goblin itch without exposing me to the ""please-play-me-forever"" trap of live-service games. I like what's offered here. Unfortunately, I can't help but imagine the what-if's if this game was launched better, the promised DLCs were delivered, bugs fixed, balance tweaked, and the publisher made right with the developer. This game could have been so much better!"
Operation: Tango,"Adventure, Casual","a bit short, but a lot of high pace fun"
Operation: Tango,"Adventure, Casual","One of the funniest co-op games I've played! Great fun with mates and would recommend anyone to pick up this game if the price is right, due to it's shortness in length. This game will take you about 4 - 6 hours depending on how good you are."
Ortus Regni,"Free To Play, Indie, Strategy",I just absolutely love it.  Very thematic.  Very strategic.  Unique.  Easy to learn.  A variety of strategies.  I think i'm going to have to go buy the physical version.
Ortus Regni,"Free To Play, Indie, Strategy",Very enjoyable and full of strategy.  An excellent game.
Ortus Regni,"Free To Play, Indie, Strategy","This game is damn brilliant. If you like board games, you need to download it. No, I'm serious. Please download this."

Outer Wilds,"Action, Adventure",I dont have this game.
Outer Wilds,"Action, Adventure","Brilliantly designed, charming, and thought provoking. It takes the most interesting parts of Subnautica and combines it with Interstellar and then throws in a bunch of aliens (like you!) because why not. The less you know going into it, the better, so I'm going to stop here and simply recommend it."
Outer Wilds,"Action, Adventure","Wow, what a game.   You really need above average intelligence to figure this game out without hints.   The dev team must really have been really smart to figure out how to put together such a game.   They did a great job.   The cartoony characters threw me off, thinking it was more of a young person's game but it takes a lot of mature logic to figure out what was going on.   I can tell the dev team really enjoy space and physics because it relies heavily upon these.   It did take me awhile to bond with the game (about 15 hours).  It was ok at first and I kept going based on all the outstanding reviews.   It was enjoyable enough to get to that point but didn't hook me in until then.   It definitely had it's frustrating moments; but then again, all games usually do.    I would definitely recommend this ride.   Reading about the game just doesn't give you a great feel of what it is all about and just has to be experienced.   Did it change my life.  No.  But I definitely enjoyed the ride.   Have fun!"
Outer Wilds,"Action, Adventure","Amazing and pretty unique game. There is basically no progression in the normal sense, it is all about learning about how the universe works. Very engaging premise and very well designed. Does some incredible things with exploration and non-linear narrative. My primary complaints are that it can get a bit repetitive and/or frustrating at times doing the same stuff over and over or just barely missing something and having to wait ~22 minutes to do it again. Also, the ""solution"" to the game is a bit underwhelming compared to what it could have been. Plus, I kind of wish there was one or two more planets and/or environments to explore as well. Besides those small issues, the game is incredible. It is a bit expensive at full price, so I might suggest waiting for it to go on sale (like $15 or less), but as it stands I really loved it and highly recommend it for those who love exploration games and experimental games. 8.5/10 With the expansion the game becomes more complete and fleshed out. 9/10 with the expansion."
Outlast 2,"Action, Adventure, Indie",Very Good.
Outlast 2,"Action, Adventure, Indie","I feel so annoyed playing this game, ive been searching here and There for item. Ive been searching a school and searching the toilets Just to progress There is a lot of enemies doing routines, making it a standard Stealth game time to time. The setting in the first game is Great. Here its a lot of simular houses and forests. Pros: Runs well Game looks Great Interesting story Okay linearity, i would like easier routings Cons: Tedious A lot of fooling around enemies Notat as cool as outlast 1 The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ search fetchquests"
Outlast 2,"Action, Adventure, Indie","I really liked the characters and the setting, it's unique to horror games. However what you get here is a scary and weird first hour and an even scarier and more weird last hour, but everything in between is dull walking that doesn't do anything for the story and it goes on for too long."
Outlast 2,"Action, Adventure, Indie",Talking about outlast 2 damn it's so awesome this is the first game which scared me to go to the bathroom at night. LOL anyways yeah everyone who who can run this game on their pc should give it a try it's worth it. And if you have already played Outlast 1 then you should definitely. This game is really big compared to outlast 1 and also really good. The thing l didn't understand about this game is that even after completing the game l didn't even get a single achievement. Which was a bad point of it but although the gameplay the storyline and the mindset of the game is superb do check it out.
Outlast 2,"Action, Adventure, Indie",Pretty good game. This isn't as good as the 1st Outlast but this is still really fun. The only scares are the over done jump scares which I don't really mind but compared to Outlast there's way more.
Outlast 2,"Action, Adventure, Indie","Hands down the best horror experience I've had in a long time. I'm surprised how little attention this game got. The story, gameplay, music and graphics were all fantastic. Also, this game did not hold back in mature content and truly aimed for (and succeeded) in making a true/brutal horror experience. I cannot recommend this game more  to all horror fans, 10/10."
Outlast 2,"Action, Adventure, Indie",Good game
Outlast 2,"Action, Adventure, Indie",perfect game
Outlast 2,"Action, Adventure, Indie",Outlast 1 was better
Outlast 2,"Action, Adventure, Indie","Decent game, improved gameplay and features upon the first especially the graphical improvement. The story though is really confusing if you're not paying 100% attention with the school flashbacks. Speaking of which, they really ruined the flow of gameplay a lot. The amount of 1-Hit kill enemies was especially annoying, and the respawns are put right next to said enemy so it's just a matter of you dying until you finally escape. Blake's voice actor is decent although the constant swearing didn't seem needed when you see something scary, as it takes away the player's reaction. The final scene though was great... Blake is trying to cope with the fact his wife has just died, he has gone completely insane and is left alone with a 'child' that isn't there. Overall, decent game with some innovation which was welcomed but the flow of gameplay and story needs to be improved for the upcoming game."

Path of Exile,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Free To Play","Dieses Spiel macht schnell süchtig, also vorsticht ;) Habe damit vor gut 10 Stunden angefangen und denke nicht das ich so schnell wieder damit aufhöre. Warum muss ich hier glaube ich nicht erklären, denn es gibt zu genüge Reviews die das bereits sehr gut tun. Was jedoch anzumerken ist, das Spiel ist ""Free2Play"". Dieser Begriff wird in den meisten eher Misstrauen auslosen, da es in der Vergangenheit genung Spiele gab, die durch dieses Modell Items, etc. für Echtgeld verkauft haben, die z.B. das Balancing dieser Spiele immens verschlechtert haben. PoE merkt man dieses ""Free2Play""-Modell jedoch gar nicht an, und man könnte es ohne Probleme auch für einen Vollpreistitel halten. In den Meisten ""F2P""-Spielen kommt man irgendwann zu dem Punkt, an dem man, ohne Echtgeld auszugeben, einfach nicht mehr weiter kommen kann. In PoE wird das jedoch nicht so schnell, wenn nicht gar nicht passieren."

Pentiment,"Adventure, Casual",That is really unique game for me. Art looks great and I enjoyed it.. but please dont make my mistake and do not repeat act1 over and over trying to get best of it. Also this game is 90% time of conversations so if you looks for something dynamic its not for you. Was fun for me.
Pentiment,"Adventure, Casual",The 'James Joyce' of video games
Pentiment,"Adventure, Casual","Yes it's beautiful and unique and it starts off great, but: - murder mystery without resolution, because they thought it doesn't matter for you who did it, after you just spend 15 hours trying to figure out who did it I could stop at this point beacause it's a dealbreaker for me, but let's go on: - horrible pacing, story just drops at one point and never picks up the tempo again - too many fillers. I understand it helps the worldbuilding but after 3 hours of gossip with millers wife I don't need another 3 hours gossip with fisherman's wife or whatever - mind-numbingly boring 3 Act - at some point it changes its tone from authentic and historical to ""let's preach about modern day politics"" -  illusion of choice but it's really linear - no proper save system - everything you do is on time-constraint which some may don't like (I don't mind)"
Police Stories,"Action, Indie, Simulation, Strategy","Decent game and I enjoyed playing it co-op. My biggest complaint against the game is the fact that enemies often have lightening quick reflexes and shoot/kill you as soon as they see you. This doesn't always happen, but when it does it is very annoying. I'd recommend picking it up on sale, not worth the full price imo."
Police Stories,"Action, Indie, Simulation, Strategy","Really fun top-down tactical game. Worked well co-op via Remote Play Together. Took 4 hours to beat on Easy. Started out really hard but got a lot easier after a couple missions (unlocked gear), probably could have stepped up the difficulty but we were still enjoying it on easy. Enemies' aim is near perfect and your guns have a scatter which gives you almost no time to react, really forces you to be tactical and use your gear. Feels satisfying to get through a level without making a mistake. Story is kinda meh but the gameplay doesn't need it. There's workshop support, haven't tried it but there's a lot of missions out there, might provide some extra play time for some players. Had a fun time with this one, recommended if you're interested and you're ok with the length."
Police Stories,"Action, Indie, Simulation, Strategy","This a short nostalgic game with retro graphics and 2D playstyle. Graphics are pretty cute and animations are coherent with that. Even though music is a bit limited, it is good and it is compatible with the noir/80’s action movie style. As you can understand from the style of the game, story is non-original and it is there only for atmospheric reasons. So, if you do not expect nothing from it, it is not bad. The main part that the game shines is the playstyle. Even though, it is a bit limited and weird at the beginning, as you unlock more equipment, gameplay gets better and you are able to play without killing anyone. However, without the equipment, there is no way for a peaceful playthrough (like real life I guess). Some of the equipment are pretty useless but if you think the length of the story mode, it has a decent variety of equipment. I prefer mostly singleplayer; so, I did not look into co-op no more than one mission and I can say that I had no problem with it. However, I can’t see a real reason to play this game with another person. I feel like, it would make it harder to get As in the missions. AI serves well as an additional equipment pack. Other than that, with the last update you can design your own levels and play other people’s levels if you are into that. I am not into that but I appreciate having it."

Ready or Not,"Action, Adventure, Indie","Game now freezes after a couple mins in any mission and remains unplayable for months now. Hogs 100% system memory. Devs wont release the fix as they dont wanna test it without the ""newest dlc being released."" You also had to be a ""Supporter"" to play the alpha. What was I supporting when I paid for this game? Wish I could ""Unsupport"" and get my money back then."

Ready or Not,"Action, Adventure, Indie","Good game, but not as ""realistic"" as the devs claim. SWAT 4 presented more realistic scenarios, the most guys you'd have to fight would be like 5 dudes.  In Ready or Not, you are routinely caught in wall to wall fire fights from all angles by like 50 guys, who are usually just security guards, not armed criminals. (Security guard would probably not fight the police) My main complaint is that as great as this game is, it comes off as total cop porn, depicting SWAT teams as gun-ho action heroes instead of the reality of what the job entails. This is closer to Rainbow Six than the original SWAT. Not really a bad thing, but I feel like it does take something away from the experience. You don't get to pick your entry point, there are no police snipers and as I said, the amount of hostiles is far beyond anything a SWAT team would be called to put down. Ready or Not also doesn't ask the same questions that SWAT does, about proper police procedure. For example, many of the arrest animations, most of which you perform on non-suspects and hostages, might be considered police brutality. (Slapping the person and shoving them to the ground. Not exactly the best way to treat someone whos been taken hostage.) This would be fine, but the game never uses this to make a statement. It just presents it as accepted procedure. SWAT 4 was very nuanced about this sort of thing in a way that these developers don't seem to be. I mean, they are banning people on the forums for making jokes about the ATF or people who mention George Floyd, even in jest. Just reeks of insecurity and an unquestioning obedience to authority. However, where I think the game shines is its atmosphere and the gritty environments. The enemies are some seriously bad people. Not just your usual gang bangers, bank robbers and terrorists. You'll raid sex slave rings, child traffickers, and a crackhouse complete with an ODing baby. Some seriously nasty stuff that borders on horror. Its incredibly violent, which is another plus. On at least one level, a suspect blows his head off rather than be taken down. The Nightclub shooting is filled with gory bodies and the mansion raid has some incredibly confronting scenes involving child murder. Definitely not a game for the faint of heart, but in this sense, I think it does depict the nature of inhumanity that humans often display to each other."
Ready or Not,"Action, Adventure, Indie",nevermind we're so back :)
Ready or Not,"Action, Adventure, Indie","This is honestly one of the best modern games I've ever played, especially with friends in coop. Very fun tactical game play, fantastic level design, very gritty and realistic, and it certainly does not shy away from very dark and uncomfortable subject matter unlike most modern video games. It is very rare that I do this, but I have been combing every inch of the maps I play in order to glean as much information as I can from the fantastic environmental storytelling. Every map tells its own little interesting and dark story of an incident that has occurred in this seedy, crime ridden city known as Los Suenos. If anything you just read sounds appealing to you then do yourself a favor and buy this game now. Trust me, it's worth every cent. My score: 10/10."

Rebel Cops,Strategy,"This a turn-based tactical game with resource management mechanics. It looks like developers wanted to follow a more populistic way after This is the Police. There isn’t any strong aspect of This is the Police franchise unfortunately. There isn’t a real story, soundtrack is repetitive, tactical combat is limited, levelling is weak and resource management is just there to be there. First of all, the story, it is overtly not the main aspect of the game. It is just there, because it needs to be. It is for providing a concept but even with that it is bad. You are in a really small town with a huge crime ring. There are hundreds of people in this mob weirdly. You can’t grasp why are you working with a known dirty cop, even though you have an evidence against him. However, Warren Nash helps you until the end. Secondly, repetition. There isn’t any variety in soundtrack and there aren’t many tracks either. Unfortunately, biggest negative part about the game is limited and repetitive gameplay. Every mechanical aspect of the game is stretched. There are only two different types of enemies, less than ten skills and three attributes. Because of these limited gameplay features, you can’t do anything different playing the game. Other than that, there is a resource management part of the game which feels forced. As a vigilante you shouldn’t have a budget and an arsenal to fight the crime, I agree with that part but while you can loot the missions for TVs, PCs or video cassettes you can’t loot the criminals for their weapons or ammo. That is just plain non-sense. Stealth isn’t such a good option either. It doesn’t reward the player catching criminals instead of killing them – there is the advantage of not using the ammo though – and shooting strategy is easier (thanks to charging AI). On the bright side, there is some variety for the missions and there isn’t much games in this category. So, if you like games likes XCOM or UFO series which don’t have a strong story you may like this game. Plus, there wasn’t any bug and the price is pretty reasonable."
Rebel Cops,Strategy,"Wow, I have not played previous games of the series as I'm not a fan of cops vs criminals genre but this one is a hidden gem. It should appeal to all avid turn-base tactics players as it's really demanding and if you're stupid you can always blame RNG so it's a win-win situation!"
Rebel Cops,Strategy,Don't expect anything like the combat in X-Com. This is more like a puzzle.

Remnant: From the Ashes,"Action, Adventure, RPG",Rogue Souls with Guns?!?!?!?!?
Remnant: From the Ashes,"Action, Adventure, RPG","This game has some serious problems, enough that I do not find it worth playing. It's buggy - untargetable enemies under the floor will kill you, flying enemies will clip into bridges/etc. and will shoot you while you can't hit them. In a game where a few hits will kill you, taking damage from bugged out enemies you can't hit is unacceptable. Its combat is poorly designed. Enemies will charge at you while out of line of sight and their charges will wrap around 90 degree angle corners. Melee swings will hit you even when you're on the other side of pillars. Bosses will enter their phases inconsistently - a boss that summons allies at 80% health one run and 40% the next can be either very hard or relatively easy based on pure luck. The main combat loop is extremely boring. The enemies felt very samey, mainly because they all require the same approach. Most of the bosses I fought had the same problem - keep your distance, plink away at the health bar, definitive bullet sponges. Level design felt like 3 areas on copy/paste, without the minimap I would have thought I'd gone in circles. Character abilities were simple, not requiring timing, aiming, or thinking. Character progression is terrible as well. Weapons unlock slowly and are basic standard gun types. Everything upgrades in zero-effort linear fashion - leveled up stats and weapons simply improve incrementally. Enemies level to match your highest gear so you get punished if you try to specialize. The game offers zero interesting decisions. Add to that the basic problems with souls-like and third person combat -- focusing on dodge timing is your only combat option, your character blocks your view in tight hallways, bullets hit object corners that your aim reticle looks clear around, etc. -- and I found the frustrations to far outweigh any entertainment value. The game is a bunch of poorly built parts cobbled into a fumbling whole. I don't understand the positive reception it has received."

Remnant: From the Ashes,"Action, Adventure, RPG",Great souls like shooter. 8/10

Serious Sam 2,"Action, Indie","I want to start by saying I don't think this is a bad game, it's just a 'meh' one, and feels like the weakest out of the main series with the possible exception of 4 since I haven't played it. I would still recommend people who miss chaotic 90s shooters to check out the series as a whole. Serious Sam 2 leans into a lot more into the comedy than the prior games, and that's the main aspect that dates this game. It feels like it was written by children at times. And while there is the occasional funny scene, many of the jokes fall completely flat. Not to mention the character design of every NPC that isn't Sam is...bizarre. That being said this is more Serious Sam, so if you liked the other games it'll feel right at home. They even added in dual wielding of any combination of weapons (although you have to look up what button does it since the game does not tell you and I discovered the feature by accident) resulting in a lot of fun. But it can be frustrating that your weapons reset and the end of every world and sometimes it can take ages to get anything better than the double barrel shotgun. It's a great gun and all but Serious Sam always felt really fun in its chaotic need to jump from gun to gun depending on the situation.  This problem is heavily amplified on the final world, where 4 out of the 7 levels reset your weapons. They also patched in a gun that got cut from the original release, but it only appears in the second world, never to be seen again. I will say to its credit that the final level is the craziest I've played in the franchise so far, where its pretty much a nonstop 40 minute barrage of absolutely everything being thrown at you. Most of the other levels are about 8-15 minutes long. Maybe Im being a bit harsh on the humor though, yet finding giant piles of poo and two of the villagers boning in a outhouse, or all of the npc's having wacky, high pitches voices just isn't my cup of tea."
Serious Sam 2,"Action, Indie",Replaying it on steam deck and I'm having fun with it. That latest updated must've changed a bit because it's nothing like how I remembered the first time i played. It now feels more like the first and second serious sam. A good change indeed.

Six Ages: Ride Like the Wind,"RPG, Simulation, Strategy","The game is interesting, but I find it so confusing that I don't know what to do. The game needs a better UI. I can't figure out how to progress. There are too many options. The red lines make you think you can't use that section when it is really a info that is meaningless. Buttons are grayed out without explaining why. You can't back out of choices. For example I made a choice and it said I would have to sacrifice animals. I didn't want to do that but there was no way to back out of the choice. Just a messy confusing game that seems pointless."

StarCrawlers,"Adventure, Indie, RPG","A fun tactical game, very much like a combination of Darkest Dungeon and Legend of Grimdark.  The different character types are all interesting to play.  My only complaint is there is a VERY steep learning moment in the campaign game, so steep I think the game is fundamentally broken at that moment.  But I played 40 hours of it, so clearly I enjoyed myself.  I'm going to give it another try eventually to get past that point, but I think it makes Ironman mode impossible, at least for me."

Terminator: Resistance,"Action, Adventure, RPG",Dark Horse of 2019. This game is seriously awesome.
Terminator: Resistance,"Action, Adventure, RPG","Not bad, but not great either and not worth paying full price imo. I paid $20, but honestly it was more of a sub $15 sale price game for me. I think big fans of the series could enjoy it more however. My score: 2.5/5 - Enemies feel a bit too spongy sometimes when played on hard difficulty (medium was too easy for me personally). - Levels were ok. Many of them honestly felt bland and similar looking after a while. - Graphics weren't bad, but the character models and animations weren't very good. - Performance was smooth and I consistently got 80+ fps throughout the game. - Experienced one crash towards the end of the game and had one bug where a character who was needed to proceed to the next area of the game got caught behind some geometry. I didn't realize this till later in the mission and so I had to load 3 checkpoints back and do that portion all over again. Aside from these, I didn't notice any other bugs. - Game play was relatively fun with a good mix of stealth and action."
Terminator: Resistance,"Action, Adventure, RPG",A fun ride.   You get more powerful as you go.  A linear game with side missions which are optional.  These side missions will still be in the same map so if you go further or in a different direction you may get something a character is asking for or you can destroy a skynet base for xp.  It has level up trees.  It has nicked a couple  elements of fallout like the way it zooms in to character faces when dialoging and the lockpick is just like fallout.    It has a nice ending battle that makes the slow pace of the rest of the game worth it to me.      They did a good job of tying into the first two movies at the end.  The infiltrator DLC was really sweet.   Clearing bunkers as a terminator.  They did a great job on what I would expect the humans to do when breached such as talking to themselves and freaking out that they are going to die.   I would give this game a 7.5/10.  Worth a buy.
The Abbey,Adventure,"It is kind of mediocre and doesn't hold up to higher resolutions very well. The artwork, setting, and character models are great, they have a nice Disney film feel to it. The adventure aspect of it was a bit poor and obtuse though, still worth a few bucks."
The Abbey,Adventure,"Plot is kinda interesting and dialogues are ok, but painful interface and ridiculous puzzles make this game really bad."
The Banner Saga 3,"Indie, RPG, Strategy","There have been a lot of improvements....but this game still suffers in the hand of idiots that don't understand game design. Think of it like the last season of Game of Thrones....where those two morons writing the show ran out of material, but think they need to kill characters off......so they do it in the laziest, most retarded, irrational way they can think of....because they are just hacks for writers. On an ending note...Spending reknown to upgrade your fighters - when its used for supplies and training is still retarded.  I'm glad the franchise is over, I am so tired of dealing with a single monetary system because they have gone out of their way with nonsense just to try and make their game unique. With the gorgeous artwork and decent story/world lore they could have just stuck with standard combat and monetary systems, filled the game with proper FULL voice acting and a narrator and have made millions over night. Keep character death to the battle field and the REALISTIC choices that are dangerous....instead of the arbitrary ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ forced on the player."
The Banner Saga 3,"Indie, RPG, Strategy","Even though I loved the first two games, this game wasn’t really enjoyable for me. Sadly, it feels like a half-finished work. A lot of characters’ stories remain unfinished, while the ending is rushed and not satisfactory at all (cutscene is really short). Developers seem to forget the substories, like the ending of the second game (Bolverk, horsemen, king, etc.). Also, there is a huge questionable game design choice. The game shortens as much as you played the game well, you see less content if you do not make mistakes or less mistakes. Still, the game is pretty short but it is actually a good thing. Because I was relieved that I was able to finish the game. The main reason for that is the constant crashes. Unfortunately, the game is not stable enough and there is no save option other than the autosave. Therefore, you will lose a lot of progress, especially with the wave system. Long battles were not enjoyable before and now with the wave system, it is worse. Crashes make the risky wave system riskier, since it is a huge gamble and the waves do not give a huge reward, while you are forced to finish the combat in quicker manner which was not enjoyable for me. Gameplay does not add very much other than a few new enemies with witch class and dredge playable characters. Levelling brings the title system which are passive abilities. Similar levelling system was present at the second game and it did not feel very well as a progress accomplishment feeling. Training system and camp management are gone and dialogues are much less with boring choices. Also, the achievement renown award system (you get 5 renown when you unlock an achievement for one time only) continues and it is more annoying with crashes. I have lost 15-20 renown, just because of crashes. If you are going to purchase this game (at least, it is not expensive), do not expect too much and be mindful, if you are an achievement hunter, since one of the achievements is not doable anymore."
Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales,"Adventure, RPG","This one is another in-between game for me. Art style is pretty good, writing is decent but story is a bit mediocre. Sadly, deck building and trying new card combinations aren’t a big part of the game. There aren’t much variety there and most of the enemies use the same cards. Only some of the boss battles are different. And there are puzzle battles (a lot of them). They offer different battles but they are not so great. I didn’t hate them and I think they give a different feeling to the game but a lot of people are annoyed by those battles. Actually, those puzzles gave me strength to finish the game. Still, it doesn’t change that they aren’t good. Other than that, there is the Witcher clickbait. He is in the game but only for one battle. So, the pictures of Geralt were a bit annoying for me. Even though, it wasn’t a bad game, I gave a thumbs down because I got really bored and forced myself to finish it."
Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales,"Adventure, RPG","Yup, it's good"
Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales,"Adventure, RPG","Thronebreaker is a very creative take on the Witcher's Gwent mini-game, wrapped in a superbly written and voiced single player campaign.   The ""battles"" all take place in card form, and the game is very clever on presenting unique scenarios to change each fight.  Some of the encounters are puzzles: you use a pre-built deck versus a pre-built scenario.  Most however use a deck that you can add/remove cards from.  Outside of the battles, you'll have to make many nuanced decisions as a leader and ruler that often have consequences to the plot and your 'army' (deck of cards.) The game itself is very enjoyable, and I'd recommend it.  There are, however, a few issues which should be mentioned: First, it's far too long.  Even on the highest difficulty, you'll probably have assembled a pretty unstoppable deck about halfway through.  After that point, the battles can all be dealt with using the same strategy, so they get very repetitious, even with the various 'scenarios' that make them vary. Second, and this is related to above, but there isn't a ton of motivation for tinkering with your deck.  You can't save different configurations, so trying a new one means scrapping the old.  None of the scenarios really punished my deck strategy either, so at no point did it force me to change it up.  This all plays into the issue of repetition. Essentially, this game is super fun and well put together, but could really afford to be shorter or more difficult.  Even with the gameplay slogging along in the 2nd half, though, the plot, decision-making and voice acting really carry it the rest of the way."

Titanfall® 2,Action,"So, the single player campaign would NOT have been worth the original purchase price.  The game looks great, and I love the back and forth between the fighty robot and the running around on walls, but the the campaign is linear as heck and far too short.  I'm glad I only paid CDN$14 for that. Multiplayer was just an afterthought for me, but after now playing for an afternoon, I'm hooked!  The mixture of FPS human running around with FPS fighty-robot mayhem is really a lot of fun.  Like most multiplayer, you can expect no team work on your side unless you are part of some organized group, but its still a blast anyway. I'm still not sure its worth full price, but on sale its well worth it."
Titanfall® 2,Action,"Great campaign, and one of my favourite if not my favourite FPS game of all time. Sadly, the multiplayer has been neglected and is now overran by hackers that keep DDoSing the servers, so if you wanna play, get the Northstar client from GitHub which is really easy to install and it is made by the community that constantly adds new game modes, anti cheat and security, custom servers + browser and everything is unlocked for you."

Torment: Tides of Numenera,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy","I saw some of the bad reviews but honestly thought they must be mistaken. Reality is I was so bored by this game that I gave up on it after only an hour. Bad combat system, bland characters, overly verbose exposition. I could not be bothered to know more and did not care to find out who my character is. I enjoyed the original game, and have played many similar games, including the Baldur's Gate series, Original Sin, and other games with lots of text, but this game just feels completely uninspired to me. It feels like it was as big a chore to make for the developers as it is for me to play. I will be requesting a refund as I got no enjoyment out of this game. Games shouldn't feel like a chore."
Torment: Tides of Numenera,"Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy","Another classic FRP / RPG piece, if you are a lover of these genres this is for you, but the turn based combat is NOT for everyone, I for one hated it and as a backer of this game I voted hybrid gameplay but somehow they managed to get the game to be made turn based only, it kills a lot of the fun for me but the story makes up for it. Definitely play it if you are a seasoned role playing game player, it takes a bit getting used to to get really into the story due to the original game system but after that its classic FRP / RPG for you. The problem is you cant customize your characters apperance, the shops in the game give you cancer, money is a big issue and you can simply talk you way out of every situation. Dont be fooled by the fact that they gave a lesser rating to Tyranny, that game is what we need, not this seriously not this."
Total War: WARHAMMER II,"Action, Strategy",Enemy armies no longer park one step beyond your range each and every time. 10/10
Total War: WARHAMMER II,"Action, Strategy","Has a lot of reoccuring minor bug issues from the previous warhammer that was supposedly fixed. (Units changing targets randomly, reinforcements showing up in odd places regardless of map positioning) Looks great graphically, the campaign is ok too.  But they didn't make much improvements on 1.  For instance, there are no unit formations...no wedges, etc.  Heavy Calvary don't work as well as they should either.  The battle AI is pretty bad too (Send in tough hero, have archers just rain arrows onto all of the enemy units that cluster around said hero). I'm down voting because it crashes non stop after 50-80 turns into a campaign on a pretty damn good rig (Nvidia 690).  I wouldn't purchase this game on steam, you run the risk of this happening to you and then getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ over by their anti consumer return policy. Will never buy another sega game again. Edit: Years later - still has the retarded ""Hey look 5 billion enemies spawn out of no where"" stupidity and hasn't changed the complete idiotic nonsense of fort sieges. I just lost a 40 minute battle of slaughtering those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rats that randomly appear at the last ritual......because one rat ogre got through unnoticed and captured my city's flag....... Nevermind the fact they lost 90% of their troops and I lost ~10% of mine and it was the last enemy unit on the field..... Nevermind the fact that my units were in the middle of killing it......nope.....we all just decided to surrender and commit suicide. Edit 2: So....just lost a battle where I brought an entire army of hawk archers. Was wrecking the crap out of the enemy - mostly ground units - had ~50% of them killed and still had a bunch of ammo. But hey...we hire ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to design things so I lost the fight where I had 4 unit losses and over a thousand kills......because ""The enemy has control of the battlefield, you must land and fight on foot!"" or some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like that.....Entire army started wavering and then just ran off. I was literally asking myself wtf just happened, in pure disbelief. My brain - in all honesty, couldn't fathom the idiots designing this game were really that retarded to PUNISH ME FOR BEING SMART. Total war....except when it comes to air superiority.....then all your units just fly off and commit mass suicide. Game was never worth $60, isn't worth $30 either. Maybe for $10 give it a shot."

Trailmakers,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Racing, Simulation","Really enjoyable build-your-own-vehicle game. Fun campaign, great variety of blocks, nice intuitive UI, co-op with a friend worked well. Went in with low expectations, came out very pleasantly surprised."
Trailmakers,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Racing, Simulation",Its too much fun. The physics are quite good.
Tropico 6,"Simulation, Strategy","Garbage game, they ripped out the enjoyment of playing tropico. Now its just annoying and tedious to play."
Tropico 6,"Simulation, Strategy","Little improvement from Tropico 5,  and the AI is completely broken,  just watched a horde of rebels sack and capture my palace while my military sat in their bases and didn't leave until it was almost over.  and said rebellion was caused by low housing and employment happiness...  by about 10% of my population who refused to move into FREE housing, and refused to get a job. I wont be buying anything from the tropico franchise ever again."

Void Tyrant,"RPG, Strategy","Extremely polished indie-gem with unique mechanics. It combines a roguelite/-like card game to a deck based dice game (your dealer cards are 1-6). Idea is to get a higher value than your opponent without going past 12. The difference will indicate strikes and various effects. You'll draw 4 cards per turn and can use your mana (called spirit) to discard and re-draw cards. You can play these cards using mana and manipulating either your own or your opponents results in various ways. Some cards impact the card values, some impact effects if you win/lose the round. Great game, although endless runs can get tedious when you've a great build. Talking to you step #174..."
Void Tyrant,"RPG, Strategy",It's amazing how much this game can take from basic Blackjack mechanics (although in this game the cards are valued 1-6 and it is 12 that you can't go over) and make it into an incredibly deep deckbuilder with 4 classes and dozens of unique baddies each with their own creative ways to skew the odds to their favor.
"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","Action, Adventure, RPG","Would burn the heretic, kill the mutant, purge the unclean again 10/10"
"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","Action, Adventure, RPG",game is too masculine I started injecting testosterone and reading Warhammer books. 10/10
"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","Action, Adventure, RPG",It's very decent though I liked Space Marine 1 better
"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","Action, Adventure, RPG","It is a solid experience, but for a $60 triple A title that is a SEQUEL I would expect a lot more campaign missions, weaponry, armors, etc. It feels like it has 10% of the content it should, with everything being a money grab. The grind itself is a bit much, even when you unlock the DLC you still need to grind and spend credits to unlock individual pieces. $10 to unlock a suit, that you need to further grind into unlocking each piece to customize is insane. Throw in the woke DI&E side squad characters and the game is a disappointing buy."
"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","Action, Adventure, RPG","I have not played a game like this for long time. Game has great graphics, good story with great lore and atmosphere. Narrative style for the campaign can be text book level for this genre. Plus, this game can be the manliest game ever in the most positive way, you can feel the epicenes at a lot of scenes. Only problem was the last boss’ design (AI was problematic at high difficulty also) for some attacks. Also, game supports co-op at campaign and operations. Other than that, PVP is pretty decent with matches that you can easily find. Even though this is AAA, it is not overpriced like most of the AAA games. Looking forward for the third game!"
"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","Action, Adventure, RPG","Choppy gameplay, choppy audio, choppy choppy. Im above the recommended specs. Wish I could get a refund"
"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","Action, Adventure, RPG","Warhammer as a franchise has had many different takes and variations on the source material, with a lot of it usually falling into the same rhythm most of the time. However the original Space Marine title released in 2011 was a stand-out experience that sadly ended on a cliffhanger, with 2023's Boltgun serving as a shadow sequel to the former, but bow in 2024 we got the much anticipated follow up that despite everything it does right, had me feeling a little muddled in some parts. Space Marine 2 picks up two centuries after the originals bitter sweet ending, with Titus serving a self-imposed exile with the Deathwatch, and after nearly dying he is saved via the Rubicon surgery, going from an Astarte's to a Primaris, a major upgrade for himself. Now just like the previous game he leads a small squad against a Tyranid invasion with a lot of the previous games story beats coming full circle and honestly the story in this game is S-Tier, even though I'm not the biggest lore fanatic, having finished the prior game gives a lot of context that you will need, however the campaign for the most part is short, with some welcomed character appearances that I will not spoil. My biggest issue with the campaign is the lack of progression throughout the 8 hour romp of bug stomping fun. Don't get me wrong, the combat in this game is incredible, you really do feel like a walking tank with a conscious, but the variety of weapons, primarily Boltguns just all feel the same, and playing the game on a harder difficulty doesn't earn you anything special, however in conjunction with the main campaign you have Operations mode which puts you in the shoes of Titus's other battle brothers, performing tasks related to the main stories events which I find far more engaging as well as rewarding, even if it does get a little grindy after a while. Just having the feature to upgrade your equipment made it a far more rewarding from my perspective, you feel like your getting stronger through your hard work which is just top notch, and the inclusion of being able to change your chapter colors is also welcomed, especially when you can make your own custom armor setup, it just felt more engaging and personal to me, and this isn't a knock against the campaign, it was still a highly polished experience. The other mode to explore is the multiplayer which allows that same kind of customization as Operations, but new outlets have reared their ugly heads with complaints of the other Space Marine's feeling like paper, and listen I get it, the game is suppose to be a power fantasy with you being the ultimate weapon but not everyone can be damn near impervious, it would really muddle the experience and for the most part I don't mind this decision since you need to think about it from the context of the lore I suppose, these are Space Marine's, men with weapons that fire high yield explosives, so it would make sense that their weapons are effective against one another y'know? I really wish there was a horde mode like the previous game, and hopefully more Operations are added in the near future, because I feel the six missions already available might get a little old, or at least give us more opportunities to earn requisition points to help expediate the mundane grind. Overall the game is well crafted, but I would recommend waiting for a sale."
"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","Action, Adventure, RPG","""The Emperor Protects... My Sanity?!"" Recommended? 69/10!! I came for the chainsword, stayed for the existential crisis. In Space Marine 2, I learned three things: 1. Jumping into a horde of Tyranids isn't as cool when they can eat your face. 2. Space Marines are basically caffeine-fueled, walking tanks with a hero complex. 3. I’m probably not cut out to save humanity. The first mission had me feeling like a god among men, smashing through enemies like a sentient blender. But by the third mission, I’m pretty sure my character was just angry that he didn’t get enough sleep or coffee because we’ve been slaying xenos for weeks without a break. The dialogue is full of testosterone and random battle cries that make me question if Space Marines are secretly poets who hate rhyming. And let’s not forget that the chainsword is the closest thing to therapy in the 41st millennium. I’ve never felt so alive. It’s not all fun though. There was that one time I was so deep in combat that I accidentally started attacking my own team. Turns out, Space Marines don’t appreciate friendly fire. Who knew? Space Marine 2 is like a brutal workout for your thumbs and your soul. Come for the purging, stay for the crisis of faith. Final Verdict: If you like your enemies served extra crispy and your friendships strained by chaotic voice chats, this is your game. May the Emperor have mercy on your save files."
"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","Action, Adventure, RPG","Haven't try co-op yet, but single-player experience is awesome."
"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","Action, Adventure, RPG","Really missed these big, buff dude power fantasy games from back in the day, a real breath of fresh air. Campaign is alot of fun, especially played with friends in coop, operations is fun, and I'm having a great time in the pvp, though it could really use some more maps. Just overall a great time. Tons of great gore, action, beautiful graphics, good performance and great enemy/character designs."
We Were Here Forever,"Adventure, Casual, Indie","Last game of the series, enjoyable but a short game. Even though graphics are better, it was a bit different from the other games. The puzzles were more like chill game puzzles that were designed differently. After finishing other games, I wanted to play from the other side. However, I did not care about it this time, since the other side was obvious or can be seen from my side. Also, ending was a bit lacklustre and wasn’t enough for an end to series. Still, this is a good game with original and unique content that worth experiencing it."
We Were Here Forever,"Adventure, Casual, Indie",Puzzles  easier than previous parts but this part has a new style totally love it
We Were Here Forever,"Adventure, Casual, Indie",These games get better and better!
Wolfenstein: The New Order,Action,perfect game
Wolfenstein: The New Order,Action,"The story isn't great but better than most of the FPS games. There are some side quests but it doesn't change anything I guess. Overally it is a fun and relaxing game. However, don't expect anything other than that."
Wolfenstein: The New Order,Action,"Filled with crashes . Take your pick from pressing enter in the menu, loading screens, changing levels, even going from one cutscene to another. It just crashes. Yes, I tried suggestions from the internet but nothing worked consistently. I'm sad I cannot play this game fully. I like the premise. A game that gives an excuse to mow down Nazis like L4D2, sign me up! It feels/looks great, considering when it was released. The cut feels deeper considering the few games I played before this runs without technical issues(in reverse chronological order) ME:Shadow of War, Bioshock Infinite, and AC: Revelations. When a game straight up crashes across many points in the game, even after many troubleshooting attempts... It's time to move on... Welp...

Wolfenstein: The New Order,Action,"Meaningless, pointless shooter. Good graphics, bad physics, boring storyline. Dont waste your money or time, dont be fooled by reviews. This is a game for the feeble minded seriously, everything is so cheesy that I didnt even feel like seeing the end of the game."
Wolfenstein: The New Order,Action,Wolfenstein: The New Order was probably one of the first games that made me want to own a PS4 (I didn't have a PC then) and I will say in 2020 it's still a spectacular game soaked with Nazi blood. If you enjoyed Return to Castle Wolfenstein I can recommend this one even if it's embracing some ridiculous design concepts like dual-wielding large assault rifles but y'know what? Screw it. I know it's not the right game to say it but rip and tear. Because that's certainly something you will be doing.
Wolfenstein: The Old Blood,Action,"Good shooter, but first game was a bit better. Story isn't detailed as first one (first one wasn't detailed too). Enemies are similar. Skill tree isn't detailed as much as first one too. However, it is more like a Wolfeinstein game. There isn't much to tell actually, it is just a fun shooter."
Wolfenstein: The Old Blood,Action,Old Blood is a good companion piece to New Order. It feels more in line with Return to Castle Wolfenstein with New Orders mechanics. By no means is that a bad thing. Using old school ram-shackled guns in the 1940s is satisfying and this allows the player to spend more time in 40s which pales in comparison to short lived introduction of New Order. It's a worthwhile side story and I highly recommend it.
Wolfenstein: The Old Blood,Action,sehr gut
Wolfenstein: The Old Blood,Action,"A nice addition, probably too expensive for what it is, but still good."
Wolfenstein: The Old Blood,Action,"Probably my favourite Wolfenstein reboot. Perfectly reimagines both Castle Wolfenstein and Wolfenstein 3D for the modern age. Its a First Person Shooter Stealth game where you can drown nazis in the toilet and have to fight Lovecraftian horrors. Not as long as The New Order but in my opinion, alot more fun. The successor games can't touch this one."
Wolfenstein: The Old Blood,Action,"My first review of this game was negative, it ran like ♥♥♥♥♥ on AMD gpus, but that was fixed now so I finally managed to finish the game. It was more of the same... THANK GOD IT WAS MORE OF THE SAME! If you like The New Order, this is not as good, but you surely won't be disappointed. Beats The New Colossus and Youngblood that's for sure."
Wolfenstein: The Old Blood,Action,woooooooooooooooo

Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel,"Simulation, Strategy, Free To Play","In all due honesty? It's a fun, Hearthstone/MTG Arena version of Yu-Gi-Oh, and a official platform to play on. Not to mention it's automated, so you don't have to puzzle out rulings - and it being an official platform means you have confidence that the rulings are, indeed, official."

Ziggurat 2,"Action, Indie","I am usually a turn-based player with really bad reflexes and I'm still having a BLAST ! This is how good this game is. This is a fast-paced, smooth and enjoyable game with a good sense of progression. Enough content, even in early access to have a lot of fun. I can't wait for the future updates !"
Ziggurat 2,"Action, Indie","A fast paced magic-themed shooter roguelite, a fun iteration of the original. + Fun weapons + Many perk choices per run + Fast game pace - Low room variety - Low enemy and boss variety - Early game a bit repetitive due to slow unlocks If you liked the original this is an easy recommend, if you didn't it's an easy skip. Otherwise if you like boomer shooters (fast movement, fun gun variety, blasting rooms of enemies) and don't mind a bit of repetition you should give this a look."
