In this game can only lv up once when you build 5 rooms but note that there is no advantage if you you up your ultimate first , certain boss got its powerful skill use when you can hold it till epic heroes comes. theres quite a lot ways to win . build rooms for at least 13 trap power , so you can win every heroes in town (Red ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ overpower built) Wont attact any Heros and use powerful spells to disable other dungeons trap so that those boss can rest in pieces from overhelming Heroes(Blue mind blowing) Keep using destory room abilty to strengthen other rooms and got more rooms(Black deadly trap recycling loop chain combos ) Em... I never try White combo but just tell me how strong it is when you try one! just mind that try building a dungon for heroes in 4,6,8,11,13 hp so they can fall into right trap :) Happy Hunting! also for developer, 1,the chain action between human players (hotseat)is so confuse 2: You didnt tell us in the game the first room we build the room abilty will not activate 3,you didnt tell us when destorying a room the hero in that room will pop back to the dungeon entrance and start again (I mean... if you dont tell us only a pro player will know this will happen) 4. please add house rules for no random starting boss thank you :D",5.4 hrs on record																					(3.1 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198022439862,6,N/A,Recommended,"After I played a bit more  (Level 8 now), I rewrite some of my reviews. -This game is a bit unbalance .  this game is expecting you have a very good learn curve because the AI is already strong from start . You can easily lose first few missions . -Five buildings/Five Lanes is not enough?  The main of this game is to use your pets to destory 3 of the building on the opposite side .You got 6 types of main building in 5 lanes , in early game you dont have much choice  usually 2 dojo, 2 bells and 1 other .You couldnt really play with your style like (1 dojo 2 school + others ) because this game is too focus on units ,strong magic is good but without a unit you cant even win the game. You dont have choice and have to go for 3 dojo because oppoents is doing 3 dojo as well . -first units of  production of the Dojo is random so you cant control your first 2-3 pet type be , you lose your first 3 moves , you lose the game. - Theme is not suitable ?  There are not much difference between Ninja cats or Samurai dogs.They have same classes so they have same skills.Even the start place of the story are the same. so you can really change cats to fishes , dogs to bears .

76561198004572694,1,N/A,Recommended,"Edit:  ♥♥♥♥ this game, its not even worth it on sale. Nothing says ""I need to be fired"" and destroys your suspension of disbelief than the Eagle fight. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ super fat old grandma killing you in 2 shots and doing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ flips with a spear. Its the stupidest, most tilting ♥♥♥♥ I've ever come across in a game..and no - ""hurr durr drugs"" isn't going to cut it. This fat old ♥♥♥♥♥ is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ doing ninja flips that would put Naruto to shame. ==== There is a cutscene every 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes, constant interruptions, constant grabbing control from the player. This game has some serious problems with disrespecting the gameplay flow and player autonomy. The constant interruptions is like I have some nanny up my ass all game. If you are playing with mouse and keyboard, make sure you remap block/parry and dodge - whoever did the default mapping apparently had more than 5 fingers...either that or they have some deep hatred for walking left. I'm 10 hours in and the game has been an absolute frustrating mess to play through, its like the developers haven't learned from or played any other games like this - I might as well have traveled back in time 10 years. Then there is the feminist ♥♥♥♥....female super thief at the start, recruit female ""best warrior on the island"" - old lady Masako who has samurai swords (which would have her beheaded), female super archer elite killer, the female armorer at the golden temple....even the first bowyer I visited was a woman. Its not just non ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stop. When rescuing Taka - I took the opportunity to assassinate the dude going to kill him only to fail the mission and get told I alerted the guy....I'm like yeah, he's kinda being stabbed right now - wtf is the problem? Well, the problem was I didn't let this boss ♥♥♥♥♥ super thief kill him. Gotta get that boss ♥♥♥♥♥ fem fatale action in while her ♥♥♥♥♥ of a brother demonstrates where the family masculinity went. Worst part of it all? This ♥♥♥♥ just sits down in the middle of a fight and gets stabbed while we were making our escape. I alt f4ed and put the game down for awhile after the stand off scene bugged out, just me staring at this mongol holding a torch...parrying my katana with his hand nonstop, while the 2nd dude I cut down prior spent 5 minutes straight crawling around dying as I tried to unbug it. This is not a triple A $60 dollar game - ♥♥♥♥ has gotten so bad in the industry that our standards are so low people will praise anything that isn't a hot turd on a plate. Grab it on sale if you insist on playing it. Edit: I uninstalled, probably for good, at the Kaede fight in the violet orchid - every ****** ""samurai"" I come across other then the sensei is female. This is the same ♥♥♥♥ they did with Assassin's Creed. The icing on the cake? The Iki Island Fort Sakai forced capture.....entire game is focused on stealth mechanics and sneaking into areas and etc......only to have our genius of a hero open the front gates, walk into a stand off you can't skip, then get hit with flash bangs and captured. The pinnacle of braindead, low quality trash tier ""I'm just here for a paycheck"" story telling. They couldn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ be bothered to allow us to take the fort with stealth and etc?

At the end of the day, this game is extremely confused as to what its trying to be - ending up in a mishmash of poorly implemented idea. The fundamental gameplay flow is constantly interrupted by burdensome mechanics. Taking Vampire Survivors as an example, you can turn your brain off and zone into tho game. This? No. Interruptions every minute or two - Whether its an XP tower, chest, collection/defend zone, boss fight introduction, enemies just showing up already encircling you...it all adds up to constant interruptions. Immediate or quickly available meta progression? Fun No meta progression at the start? Anti Fun (No, garbage gun upgrades don't count) Rerolls, bans, swaps, and etc when getting upgrades? Fun Not having them at all and bricking your run if you get a bad selection? Anti fun and stupid. Having a health bar? Cool, Fun Having NO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ HEALTH REGEN? Anti Fun And no, the .04 you might be able to get 13 minutes in? That doesn't count. Gaining max health not healing you for that health gain? Stupid. Even the healing items are pathetically weak. XP collection orb to grab missed XP? Fun Locking that orb behind a tough tower that shoots large bullets that hit for a massive chunk of your health? Anti fun and outright retarded. Unlocking meta progression elements and parts of the ship? Fun Locking the entire meta progression behind expensive purchases and killing the 3rd boss? Anti fun and retarded. It shouldn't take me 5 to 6 runs to get to purchase meta progression.....then another 10+ just to get a couple of upgrades. Bee Hive that spawns bees when you hit it? Fun Bee Hive that DOESN'T STOP spawning a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of bees when you it it? Anti-Fun and retarded. I didn't make it past that before uninstalling. Maybe will pick it up again after some updates, but right now I'm not convinced the devs know wtf a fun bullet hell game is.

Everything else is fine, but jesus christ with the plot exposition... = After playing into chapter 5, I have to say the writing is god awful. Never mind 1 dimensional characters, damn near all of the characters at that.....the people who wrote this story have no idea of how a military works. I simply refuse to believe that 4 massive regiments of a siege force can surround a castle in the middle of a river on top of a massive hill without being noticed. This is blitzkrieg level ♥♥♥♥, but without the tanks and parading through neutral territory. Somehow, a kingdom just coming off a war and very distrusting of even its own nobles....didn't see a massive military marching across the continent. Not only that, but this military managed to ford the river 3 times to surround the castle on land and sea. Its unbelievable and feels like a toddler came up with the idea. Imagine watching Troy, but no siege or Trojan horse...that the Trojans were completely caught off guard and got slaughtered because they somehow missed a giant fleet and massive army marching towards their gates.....and forgot how their gates worked. =Final thoughts. If you must, grab it on super sale.  I find myself mashing the skip and fastforward buttons for most of the dialogue. The game design is amateur at best. They commit 2 cardinal sins that no game should ever do. They introduce new mechanics knee deep into the game and the introduction is retarded. 1. There is a storyline that requires you to trick a village elder from leaving his home while looking for a pink salt rock. You have to talk to him, then go back and RE TALK to 2 other party members you've already talked to. This is not done anywhere else in my play through and I'm 20+ hours in. The problem? Failing to do this outright brings you to a game over. I got an achievement for it......30% as of writing this decided to look up the answer instead of quitting. 2. There is a minecart level, near the end of the game that introduces minecart mechanics....problem? I still have no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idea how to use them. Anyone with a positive IQ would have designed these to have an action option to use the cart...instead they look like they are automatically used. The minecart garbage is simply not the right fit for the game and if you're the person who designed it that is reading this: _ I sincerely request you leave the industry. It wasn't fun, it wasn't intuitive, it doesn't fit the game systems, and after losing twice because I hate grinding the tavern mock battles I took a long break from the game.

Speaking of which - Divine Divinity lets you click to move towards an enemy.....this game makes you actually have to click a move command. I don't know if its truly a bad game, but its lack of polish and quality shows heavily. I mean, they didn't even have a trigger for finding the commander...I had to click on him, then select the quest.  That is reserved for SIDE QUESTS, not the main quest....I shouldn't be able to waltz around and skip the commander when my quest was to go find them. Region triggers.....they exist for a reason.

Then BAM, a group of bandits show up out of no where.....much better equipped, landing damn near every blow and crits like no tomorrow. There is a fine line between hard and retarded......and these Devs sat on the ground and dragged their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ about half a mile across that line. My first party's death wasn't a good death, the battle wasn't ""difficult"" as my guys just got curb stomped, I learned nothing because I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ did everything right in terms of tactics, running wasn't an option, and I don't feel like it was my fault. My only take away from this is spear wall and shield wall take up a retarded amount of fatigue. Aside from that, the gameplay gets a little stale and the interface is a little awkward. The character building is fun at least...but the random events seem a little off. Edit: 2nd time around....lost the entire party within 30 minutes.  Kick the crap out of 2 groups of bandits, have my crossbow guy nailing every shot. Then? Suddenly a 3rd group shows up.....better equipped, lands EVERY MOTHER ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ HIT THEY DO, CRITS LIKE CRAZY and my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crossbow guy who I just gave +4 to archery misses 4 out of 5 shots....I mean MISS as in not even hitting the target. Its literally like the game just decided I need to die.  I honestly think its the same RNG ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that darkest dungeon does - where the dice are rigged against you and insane odds are being seen.  If I wanted to play darkest dungeon with a cheating DM, I'd play darkest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dungeon. ========== Edit: Tried hard to enjoy the game but its just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid.

Bring the right equipment? Doesn't work. Only take low danger quests? Doesn't work. Flee from fights? Works until you run out of pay because even on easy economy you will find yourself with either a lack of equipment, or a constant 2 days of pay for your troops, or severely lacking troops.  You can't win. I honestly want to just run a small group of 4 and do easy quests.....then get bored as ♥♥♥♥ and quit OR have one of my guys one shotted by some trash with a wooden flail. Someone needs to put out a workshop mod for this piece of ♥♥♥♥ to have full enemy loot to make the game remotely playable.  Its ridiculous to lose half my party fighting a tough ambush, killing enemies with much better gear....to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ find nothing but garbage in the loot and half my old gear missing. Edit 3:  Last attempt before I rage uninstalled. I played like a coward, just doing safe trade caravan guarding and deliveries...saved up for HEATER shields and chain armor that was over 100 durability, even had some solid kettle helmets and nice maces. 3 guys with this gear and a bunch of archers. Was doing pretty well until we came across this one group of trash thieves. Kicked the crap out of them, lost 1 guy in cheaper armor. Fine, fair enough. But this one dude?? This ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ archer....lands a nice crit from afar and 1 shots one of my archers.  The rest of the baddies are dead, my dudes manage to catch up to him. WHAM, knocked him to like 20% health with 1 mace hit. Then I move my last guy with a heater, full chain and a solid helmet up to him.....the guy who has done nothing but take defense, fatigue, and health...as well as colossus, gifted, and shield mastery. He gets to the archer...ends his turn.....the archer takes his turn next.....Stabs my guy once for 80% of his health....with a tiny dagger.....injured no less.....SURROUNDED TOO.....

No idea where a full suit of chainmail wanders off too but it sure as ♥♥♥♥ didn't stay on my guy's corpse.  ~3k gold down the drain. Who knows? Maybe we threw it out because it had a dagger sized hole in it. The heater too I imagine.  You know...because we can repair a shield split in half and a completely ruined padded armor..but the heater and shield that some archer (who had to look like Quagmire from Family guy after discovering the internet) shoved his dagger through?

This game is a masterpiece when it comes to making you feel helpless, especially in adventure mode. ============== Game has a good look and feel, but not much else. The devs do NOT know how to balance, every new master + set of cards are overpowered because they are putting sales over quality of life. IE: Morella's dragon.  They are 90% autowin cards. The gameplay mechanics themself are terrible, you will often find yourself in a position where you just lost for 5 minutes straight as you can never get anywhere. Mana is extremely restrictive and makes hearthstone look like a balanced game.  There are a ton of useless cards that are over priced as well.  10 mana for a medium tank and maybe some archers who die instantly to aoe - vs a massive golem with tons of hp and a massive aoe swing. 9 mana golem - pretty much 1 shots everything...summon a 7 mana air unit that has knockback and high damage to counter?  Newp, because after you summon that there's not only a horde of minions coming your way the enemy master just got a free massive demon tank.  spawn some units to counter? Have them lightning bolted and killed. Summon the 7 mana ranged guy sooner you say?!  Sure.....and watch it get killed by a 5 mana ranged unit or 3 mana lightning bolt. and its 4 cards to a hand.....who is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idiot that decided a 4 card hand was an ideal number?? Its like they hired the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idiots from Blizzard that thought jade golems was a good idea. The matchmaking is even worse, they favor time over quality - often leaving you with a pug vs arranged team or against someone way to high for your level.

(Units changing targets randomly, reinforcements showing up in odd places regardless of map positioning) Looks great graphically, the campaign is ok too.  But they didn't make much improvements on 1.  For instance, there are no unit formations...no wedges, etc.  Heavy Calvary don't work as well as they should either.  The battle AI is pretty bad too (Send in tough hero, have archers just rain arrows onto all of the enemy units that cluster around said hero). I'm down voting because it crashes non stop after 50-80 turns into a campaign on a pretty damn good rig (Nvidia 690).

Great setting, cool combat, etc....love the destructible environment....but fails on so many basic design levels its disgusting. I don't understand how these people managed to make shadow warrior a decent game because it sure doesn't show for this game. 1. God awful maneuvering, you can't quick jump/dash away from a charging enemy.  All you have is a sprint, so if you want to strafe quickly you need to turn and sprint to the left or right. 2. The scenarios are generally garbage....There are tons of explosives everywhere you'd think at some point they would say ""Hey, maybe we should give our player some room to move around?"",  Nope...you are always finding yourself in crowded environments full of boxes, crates, pipes, indestructible fences, etc. I got to one boss fight so far....was the most cringeworthy thing I've seen. At no point in time do you EVER have never ending enemies spawning in an FPS.  Thats absolutely lazy design. 3. Every battle scenario is accompanied by cutting off your escape route....no running back, pacing yourself, etc. 4. At no point in the time does the game teach you what or how the guns are used. I still don't understand and I'm just guessing that you work off their armor with one gun, then plasma blast them...but consistency isn't easy to find. 5. No crouch....seriously....they added jumping but no crouch. 6. Invisible walls everywhere to the point where the enviroment is very misleading and causes you to waste tons of time trying to jump around on things. 7. Minor complaint, but the story is awkward.  You are not properly introduced to anyone or anything, its like literally jumping into the middle of a book. 8. Terrible hit and collision detection.  Those gorrilabot things will still hit you with their charge despite them never physcially colliding with you. I'll commend them on the cutscenes, the compromise on a regenerating shield instead of health, decent voice acting, graphics, and destructible environment, and even cool combat when the game isn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on you...but the general battle scenarios suck.

It's not so much the expensive weapons and xp grind, the maintenance is ridiculous.  The game can be very fun when you actually get things to use, but 3-4 matches in and some of your equipment is half dead...and very expensive to repair, so expensive that it will keep you in this perpetual loop if you want to actually use the things you saved up for. Example: You just start with a rifle (You have to repair this and any attachments for it as well, including ammo), no melee weapon, no grenades, nada. You grind out some matches, dying a lot in the process, to get XP for ribbons. Those ribbons give you access to gear....gear you have to purchase. Once purchased, the gear will degrade heavily if its not basic stuff. After 5-6 matches, grenades cost me ~50% of the price (7200ish) to repair.  you only get 2 to 6k per match, even with excellent scoreboard rankings It literally feels like hazing, you will get killed left and right, and go up against superior equipment...especially if you are palying US. Germans and Russians ALWAYS have tons of grenades, scopes, sniper rifles, OP tanks, etc. Still a lot of hackers as well. Tons of people using Radar. Some of the battles are so depressingly one sided (Terrible match making system) that I've spent at least 4 hours sitting at a base and just shooting a wall to level up the gun or just driving in circles. Top all of that off with idiotic bullet tracers coming at you from competely different directions than the guy shooting and I've got about a month left before I drop this altogether.

At worst, I got some very good laughs in at some of the minor problems with the game. Monsters die a lot more quickly than they do in god of war, dante's inferno, etc so I was really happy with the faster paced combat and that I didn't spend 20 minutes fighting trying to kill things. Its an ok game for 2-3 bucks, I wouldn't pay 5 though as it lacks polish. So I can recommend it if you like the genre and want to support indie developers. I'll be buying and LPing the expansion as well.",5.8 hrs on record,N/A
76561198004572694,21,N/A,Recommended,"Horrible game, so much missed potential. The performance is horrible on high end machines, I'm lucky to get 30 fps on normal settings with one nvidia 690. The graphics are poorly optimized and are not good enough to justify poor performance. The ai for characters is poor as well. My character regularly walked about in circles trying to get into a building right next to him. The game is buggy and very unintuitive, tooltips are far and few for many things. I recommend saving your money. The game has a ton of potential, but the execution is bad. Unless you already know how to play or plan on looking up guides, you will have a stressful time getting into this.",3.1 hrs on record,N/A
76561198004572694,21,N/A,Recommended,"Highly recommend it. Graphics are nice, the music is soothing, and the puzzles are a nice change of pace. Some of the puzzles seemed a bit odd or tedious, but overall I enjoyed them. This is easily worth $10. I'll definitely be on the look out for more games from them.",6.3 hrs on record																					(6.2 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198004572694,21,N/A,Recommended,"Was a decent game for 5-10 bucks. Makes for a great stocking stuffer for younger people, I found the puzzles a little bit too easy. Voice acting, graphics, and animations were average. Storyline was average as well, just overrall an average game, worth killing a few hours of time over, the puzzles felt pretty unique except a sudoko one. The hidden object scenes were cool, a good throw back to those kids magazines you find in the dentist office.  =P Also.....Angelica is one hell of a cleptomaniac......",9.7 hrs on record,N/A
76561198004572694,21,N/A,Recommended,"Overall experience was great after the first 2 chapters.   7/10 NOTE: The game spoils both the book and tv series.  It runs on the same timeline as the tv series. The beginning of the game just doesn't get ya into it until the real action starts. The story has Goerge Martin himself involved in ensuring its as intriguing as usual. The graphics were ok...they kind of have this wierd ""grow on ya"" effect where the initial poor graphics at the start (Including the glitches) seem to fade away. All in all, the environment was done very well and hey.......they gots brothels!! The combat was terrible in my opinion, you'd have to spend half of it paused to get anything done, AI was minimum. I ended up giving up on hard mode and switching to easy mode, just running through the game in beginner armor for style points. (I actually consider this awesome, because their starting gear was the best looking stuff in the game) I made it pretty far without having trouble, with a few difficulty spikes as the exception. It ruins the experience to run through it with hodgepodge armor pieces or varying types. A lot of the classes don't seem balanced properly, judging by the complaints. I recommend playing or watching it for a great story (Even has voices from the tv series) and a decent amount of moral choices to make. I didn't feel they were overall game impacting, but it was fun non the less, on a dragon age genre level. If you are a big fan of the series looking for more story and lore, I recommend it. If you are looking for an awesome in-depth RPG, this probably isn't for you. I'd happily pay $30 bucks for it to help get a sequel out on the market (Non fan biased view probably has ~15 as a proper price)",26.6 hrs on record,N/A
76561198004572694,21,N/A,Recommended,"My overall experience of the game was great. 9/10 Moral Choices: There were some choices in the game, but a bit difficult to actually notice them or understand how to make the choice for a couple of them. Story: Was alright, not entirely easy to follow and the end is a bit of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Graphics: Some cheap explosive effects from cannisters, and the sandstorms could have used a little polishing.  Other than that the graphics were fantastic, they paid a decent amount to minor details such as injuries and bandaging them up as the game goes along. Guns: There was a decent variety, but I mostly stuck to the starting weapons, the pistol had amazing accuracy and stopping power, and the rifle had little kickback. Controls: Pretty good with some dashing/sprinting exceptions. IE: Trying to manuever around and taking cover on a column was tough.  Also the toggle mode for sprint was annoying as hell, holding it down and letting go would have been much better. AI: The AI was decent, but at some points there were glaring issues and oddities in their behaviour.  Not enough to detract too much from the gameplay. Some of what these guys were wearing made absolutely no sense for a desert. IE: A super heavy suit of armor Difficulty: Played it on the 2nd hardest mode, felt it was mostly well balanced. Theres a difficuly spike towards the end, which I found very frustrating. I don't think the game was done justice, for my first over the shoulder ""FPS"" I was quite pleased with it.",9.2 hrs on record,N/A
