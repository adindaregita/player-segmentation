76561198105784816,3,N/A,Recommended,"It is a different game than Doom 2016 was, that's for sure. The platforming caught me off guard and it took me quite some time to get along. I've died many more times by falling than by being killed by demons, yet now I actually enjoy it. It is fun, after all. There are many secret areas that show on your automap, yet actually getting to them isn't always easy. It's not impossible either, tho! I was disappointed by the low ammo storage (even when fully upgraded!) but after some time learnt how to deal with it (chainsaw is the obvious answer, along with using all of your arsenal. That's getting us to my main complaint - it doesn't work so well with the necessity to use specific weapons against specific demons. It kinda destroys Doomguy's creativity. And the story & lore I really love! I've read most of the codex entries and watched most of the YouTube theories videos. I can only hope it will expand with the upcoming DLCs. It is true the game is somewhat dumbed down and the ""legal"" in-game cheats weren't necessary, TBH... But it's up to you, after all, nobody forces you to use them. The campaign was a little too short for me my liking, but leet's hope the DLCs will cover that as well. I don't care at all about multiplayer, so not rating that.

76561198105784816,4,N/A,Recommended,"Well, this is one of the most fascinating games I've played. So many choices, so many consequences, great story... And hundreds hours of fun for those who enjoy great RPGs. On easy settings the combats are not very difficult even fore casual gamers, on hard you have to strategize a lot and it can be challenging even for experienced gamers. Interestingly enough, the combats will be much more harder as your characters gets on higher levels. But there are usually many ways that lead to victory, you just have to find those that suit your playstyle, which could take some time. If you're willing to give this game the time it needs, it will reward you accordingly, and I'm not talking about achievements nor loot from monsters. It resembles me Mass Effect trilogy in many ways - Bioware's handwriting is recognizable indeed. (Although it took me some time before I realized that many of my most beloved games - Mass Effect, Dragon Age, SW:KOTOR, Neverwinter Nights, Baldur's gate and Jade Empire have one common denominator :)",145.2 hrs on record																					(124.5 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198105784816,4,N/A,Recommended,"Jagged Alliance has been one of my most beloved game series for some twenty years now. But I feel most sentiment towards the oldest one, the original JA. Yes, the graphics looks ancient today. Its mechanics lacks a lot of things that were addressed in Deadly Games and later in JA2 and a few things can be quite frustrating. Yet I like it more than JA:DG - because it has story, more tactical choices and gives you much more freedom in the way how you'd like to make your way through the game. I guess it has very little potential to attract new generation of gamers and the only ones to purchase this game will be antediluvians such as myself, who have spent hundreds hours playing it  twenty years ago, but it is a pity, because only a handful of games are so memorable... and can be played over and over again and lose little of their appeal decades after their first release. JA:DG are much more straightforward, they add multiplayer (sort of), level and campaign editor, Mickey the weapons dealer with the most stereotypical Irish accent I've ever heard... Game mechanics are a wee bit more polished y'know, but the missions are in the order Gus Tarballs lays them for you, one per day and that's that... Don't get me wrong, it's not worse game than the original JA, in some ways it's better and I spent probably hundreds of hours playing it as well... Yer it lacks some charm of its predecessor, at least for me. TL;DR: If you're under thirty, don't buy it, you probably won't like it. If you're old enough to remember its first release and enjoyed it then, get it on sale, for 2,49‚Ç¨ it's a bargain and the game is still as much fun as it once was - and you get both JA and Deadly games. It runs in DOSBox, so it works even on Win10 and machines built in 21st century ;-)",4.1 hrs on record,N/A
76561198105784816,4,N/A,Recommended,"Simply put: best Rally sim far and wide even though still in early access; Yet the devs are working quite hard on improving, enhancing, debugging, expanding (unlike those of many other ""eternal early access"" games). A good wheel with FF (and ideally with H-shifter, as the support is perfect even now and is being polished gradually) is a MUST to enjoy the game fully, if you intend to play it with keyboard, just please don't. Also, I'd like to stress how important a wheel controller for playing this game, much more than any other racing game I've played so far.

This is just an arcade, not a rally sim, not even close. I'd be able to get over that if there were some decent wheel support, but no, it's crappy and at best can be played with an xbox controller - but frankly, why would anyone want to play this worthless piece of poor coding on anything?

76561198105784816,4,N/A,Recommended,"TL;DR version: It doesn't need core i5 CPU to run, even unsupported CPUs like Opteron with old mid-end GPU will suffice. Since I'm just a few hours into the game, I won't comment onto the storyline,, though so far i enjoy it. I merely want to rectify the hardware requirements - since it says Core i5 or Phenom II X4 are minimum, I bought this game knowing I'll probably have to rebuild my... castrated... gaming rig, since for quite some I'm playing only on my ancient Sun Ultra workstation, slightly modified to serve as a backup casual gaming machine - and since AMD Opteron is nowhere near a typical gaming CPU, I was more or less sure that neither one of its current GPUs (viz. GTX550Ti and GTX750Ti) is going to save it this time. Well, long story short, either of them actually did the job. Of course not at ultra details, but still at FHD medium and medium-high details respectively, the game runs between 40 and 60 FPS all the time. Loading times are little longer, since installation is 40GiB, thus it just didn't fit on the SSD, but no in-game lags so far - even more amazing considering the OS is W8.1/64 with added W2k12r2 server features... So unless you need ultra details @120+fps, even 8 years old former unix workstation with 4 years old mid-end GPU can make it through.

76561198045196300,1,N/A,Recommended,"RPG's often come in a wide variety of sub genre's, often resulting in experiences that promise so much but also provide very little, and sometimes that's fine, sometimes it's not, this is usually tied to the very unrealistic expectations set by others or by previous iterations on the formula. Then there's Kenshi, a game that I had heard about but never really paid no mind to, mainly do in part to my lack of comprehension about it. So like any like minded hedonist that throws money at Steam like a cheap stripper I bought it, and the best way I can describe Kenshi is it's like Peter Molyneux pitched the original idea of Fable to a bunch of ardent Stronghold and Fallout players, then gave them a bunch of salvia and said ""have at it"". Kenshi *has* no story, you make the story as you play, a concept often pitched at large expo's bi-annually for the next big RPG is done so perfectly unceremoniously that I honestly didn't know what to do with myself. Yeah you get tutorials that give you some helpful info, but for the most part you're left to you're own devices. And like any good RPG regular I decided to get quests! Their are no quests. No journals, no markers, no compass, nothing, just you, a map with two locations, and your own grit, so to lightly recount my experience it goes like this. When I first started playing I made the discoveries that most players would have made after a little bit of exploring which is that there's no quests, I decided to read up a little and opted to start mining iron outside of the hub, which proved to be harder than I though since I was always getting randomly attacked, eventually I sold enough iron to get building materials to rebuild a mediocre shack in the hub and began to research. After some time I went to Squin and met Ruka, a Shek woman that became my bodyguard, and first ""mate"" of my crew. With our combined strength we maximized mining and Ruka protected me, we made a bunch of money but got caught in a scuffle at the bar in the hub, accidentally stealing from the bar owner after mistaking him for a downed bandit that attacked the hub, no longer allowing us to buy or sell to him. After this I made a storm house just outside of the hub, and failed to start successfully fabricating clothing for money, I found myself facing debt, only eeking out minor profit from ""the rebel base"", a bar outside of the hub, I tore down the storm house and began building a long house further down the road from the hub, setting up mining operations, and a wall. Eventually I took my character and Ruka to the swamps, and there I met Doctor Chung, Hamut, Miu, and Ray, along with finding other settlements that sold Hashish, and made just enough money to afford mercenaries to defend my base near the hub since it was constantly under siege and eventually taken over by bandits. After this I returned to my base where I built up the wall, and starting making a steady stream of money through mining, eventually leveling the wall up to be more durable, and making manual labor easier, so easy that my cash flow afforded me a Shinobi guild membership, I found a nearly dead slave that begged me for mercy and medicine, eventually naming him ""Bule"" and assigning him engineering duties at my base, quickly proving his resourcefulness. And now where I'm at in my current play through is that I learned that the bar in the hub was abandoned, so I ransacked it, and now my base is a small settlement that's moving closer to industrial trade with farm goods like hemp, wheat, and cactus so I can make a steady food supply, make rum for trade, and make hemp based bio fuel for both my uses and trade, with plans to expand into the drug game selling hashish, and killing the dust boss so I can rule my area undisturbed and this is all from just doing my own thing with no markers or objectives, honestly making this game feel very unrelenting and very ""outlaw"" in a way, you are free to do almost anything and my only gripe is the fact that I can't take over settlements like the hub, but since this game supports workshop, I wouldn't be surprised if it became a mod or an official feature. And I know what I just wrote out was a lot and it probably has sold you on the game *however* this point in my playthrough was achieved through a LOT of trial and error, a lot of reloading saves and hoping RNG was on my side, because it does become frustrating sometimes but when it works, it works wonderfully, and it's given me a great sense of fulfillment especially for an RPG, but I can see how people might get frustrated or feel intimidated by it, I certainly felt like uninstalling it a few times but for the most part Kenshi is a MUST play for people that want the maximum in wish fulfillment.",63.1 hrs on record																					(24.8 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198045196300,1,N/A,Recommended,"Imagine this, it's the year 2010, Blockbuster for the most part is still around, Game Informer is still at it's peak, and I am roughly 9 years old. Around this time I was painstakingly awaiting the release of the then unreleased Red Dead Redemption, a game that to my knowledge was just going to be a follow-up to the 2004 classic, Red Dead Revolver, and boy was I shocked at how much that statement was hollow. I know what you're wondering, why the stupid backstory, to put it simply, when I was a kid, I was far too stupid to fully appreciate and understand just how grounded and nuanced it was compared to it's predecessor. Now in 2024, Redemption has hit the PC market with the help of Double Eleven, and can I say that after the launch of the GTA Definitive Edition it's relieving seeing a port that not only works (even though there much to be said about that ""Edition""), but feels like it's been completely left unaltered, which is surprising since this game is now three console generations old, but regardless feels just as good as it did back in 2010, which really gives me hope for more future collaborations between these guys and Rockstar, they know what their doing, although it is a shame that the Multiplayer couldn't be salvaged or the CO-OP campaign but that's fine since I believe more people would be interested in the main story and it's expansion. To summarize both sections of this package, Red Dead Redemption on it's own still holds up, especially after 14 years, the story for the most part seems far more anxious, with stakes being high all throughout, I say this since RDR2 is a prequel to this game and if you are someone who only played RDR2 would may be in for a surprise at how much this game doesn't try to be an immersive sim like RDR2, it's the perfect middle ground for an experience that wants you to explore and have fun without the burden of these almost unnecessarily drawn out additions from the second, although skinning animals may be a little tedious with the same three animations playing out depending on the size of the animal. Some people may be gutted at the lack of customization that was seen in the second but I actually like the outfits in this since they work as a greater incentive to interact with the game worlds side activities, and I found myself enjoying the game far more this time around at the age of 25, because it's a great demonstration of positive reinforcement, since these outfits provide buffs and perks, with some seeming solely situational, and even if that's true it's a nice little payoff for exploring and interacting with a world that's actively hostile. As for Undead Nightmare, it's....okay? I must just be old but for what it's worth it's a fun little addition, even if it feels like a bi-product of the zombie craze of the late 2000s to early 2010s, it's a relatively short expansion, not to the point where it feels like a waste of time, because it's certainly fun, a nice little distraction from the more realistic main story. Overall with the argument being made that a 14 years old game is not worth 49.99 being somewhat valid, I will say that you will get your money's worth with RDR, whether you buy it at full price or on a discount, it's certainly a game that's stood the test of time, being a smash hit that left a lot of young and old gamers in 2010 cry, feeling a sense of fulfillment that was almost unprecedented at the time, I will say that it would be cool to see the multiplayer skins for Revolver be included as costumes, or Double Eleven and Rockstar can repurpose them for a Revolver remaster, which I would like to see, especially if it's handled by Double Eleven",57.1 hrs on record																					(28.5 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198045196300,1,N/A,Recommended,"For what it's worth, Loadout was an ambitious and dorky idea that was sadly mismanaged. I recall playing the game first on the PS4, and then on PC and immediately was thrown off on how differently both games had been updated, with this version, feeling VASTLY inferior to the console version, this was due in part for reportedly being remarked as a premium version of the game, and on top of that the nasty monetization leading to a lot of contention, but after some further digging it appears that they couldn't retain talent due to management. But, despite all that, Loadout's concept on paper and in practice was entertaining, vulgar, and full of creativity that never really took off the ground, with that being the insane amount of customization the game allowed with your weapons which was INCREDIBLY fun when I played, but I quickly realized that this feature was a victim of P2W since you can buy crates to acquire parts that could make incredibly destructive creations early and I remember facing someone that had obviously went this route on console.

In total I hit the three hour mark of the game when I spent a lot of it trying to troubleshoot the frequent crashes and launch failures that plagued this version of the game. I tried uninstalling and reinstalled, deleting a directory (which works temporarily), and waited for a patch which did not bring a solid fix for me.

76561198045196300,1,N/A,Recommended,"Remakes, something so modern that it's infectious. It was no surprise to me when this remaster was announced, and I know I mentioned ""remake"" in the intro but I feel that for the most part now a days both terms are so interchangeable that it really makes no difference to me. Dead Rising is a franchise that for the most part stayed consistent, even with it's largely forgettable fourth entry, and now Capcom has decided to kick-start the franchise's heart like the zombies that litter the Willamette Mall of the original, and for the most part the game was okay, certainly had the same feeling as the original just without the sillier presentation it was known for due in part to technical limitations, this time around thanks to the power of the RE Engine Dead Rising has a grungier, almost realistic depiction, somewhere close to Dead Rising 3 in my opinion. I did experience some crashes early on which eventually got better, I would blame this on the Engine being pushed to it's limits with the high body count, and for the most part it wasn't too much of a hindrance, but with a new look comes the obvious quality of life improvements, such as being able to move while aiming with a firearm (which can be disabled), auto-saves, the time system getting a ""fast-forward"" option, and PP stickers glowing for easy identification. As someone who adores the original I will say it was strange how quickly I leveled up in the game but it didn't bug me too much, the addition of a durability bar for weapons was also nice, but I will say the hud was a little weird, my only complaint would be how the health bar would just go across in a straight line as you advanced, instead of it being two lines but that's just a mild complaint. The biggest point of contention for fans is ""censorship"" with the word ""woke"" being thrown around like a pair of dice, and listen, I understand that media is changing, but the 2016 re-release of the original game on Steam has minor censorship, yet I hear no complaints on it. The biggest take away's with this Remaster is the removal of lewd material such as Isabella's thong riding up her ass, the Erotica category being removed which did change a cutscene with Kent a little (and it was a little silly how they tried to hide it), Cliff's dialog being changed to avoid the use of ""communist"" terms, and the biggest change being to Larry Chiang (The Butcher), understandably these changes came due to investors, not some ""woke boogeyman"" and at the end of the day these changes are so inconsequential, the games still the same gory horror game with just a modern face lift, I know the ""yellow paint"" discussion is thrown around a lot and I agree that it's unnecessary in this game, especially when you have a GPS and obvious things to mantle onto. At the end of the day it's an okay remaster, and if your a fan of the original I believe you will enjoy it to some capacity like I did.",11.2 hrs on record,N/A
76561198045196300,1,N/A,Recommended,"Warhammer as a franchise has had many different takes and variations on the source material, with a lot of it usually falling into the same rhythm most of the time. However the original Space Marine title released in 2011 was a stand-out experience that sadly ended on a cliffhanger, with 2023's Boltgun serving as a shadow sequel to the former, but bow in 2024 we got the much anticipated follow up that despite everything it does right, had me feeling a little muddled in some parts. Space Marine 2 picks up two centuries after the originals bitter sweet ending, with Titus serving a self-imposed exile with the Deathwatch, and after nearly dying he is saved via the Rubicon surgery, going from an Astarte's to a Primaris, a major upgrade for himself. Now just like the previous game he leads a small squad against a Tyranid invasion with a lot of the previous games story beats coming full circle and honestly the story in this game is S-Tier, even though I'm not the biggest lore fanatic, having finished the prior game gives a lot of context that you will need, however the campaign for the most part is short, with some welcomed character appearances that I will not spoil. My biggest issue with the campaign is the lack of progression throughout the 8 hour romp of bug stomping fun. Don't get me wrong, the combat in this game is incredible, you really do feel like a walking tank with a conscious, but the variety of weapons, primarily Boltguns just all feel the same, and playing the game on a harder difficulty doesn't earn you anything special, however in conjunction with the main campaign you have Operations mode which puts you in the shoes of Titus's other battle brothers, performing tasks related to the main stories events which I find far more engaging as well as rewarding, even if it does get a little grindy after a while. Just having the feature to upgrade your equipment made it a far more rewarding from my perspective, you feel like your getting stronger through your hard work which is just top notch, and the inclusion of being able to change your chapter colors is also welcomed, especially when you can make your own custom armor setup, it just felt more engaging and personal to me, and this isn't a knock against the campaign, it was still a highly polished experience. The other mode to explore is the multiplayer which allows that same kind of customization as Operations, but new outlets have reared their ugly heads with complaints of the other Space Marine's feeling like paper, and listen I get it, the game is suppose to be a power fantasy with you being the ultimate weapon but not everyone can be damn near impervious, it would really muddle the experience and for the most part I don't mind this decision since you need to think about it from the context of the lore I suppose, these are Space Marine's, men with weapons that fire high yield explosives, so it would make sense that their weapons are effective against one another y'know? I really wish there was a horde mode like the previous game, and hopefully more Operations are added in the near future, because I feel the six missions already available might get a little old, or at least give us more opportunities to earn requisition points to help expediate the mundane grind. Overall the game is well crafted, but I would recommend waiting for a sale.",32.6 hrs on record																					(18.6 hrs at review time),N/A

With that out of the way I will open up by saying that Outlast is genuine horror experience, playing into the fears of isolation, and the dark. It's a formula that we're all familiar with, with you playing as a defenseless individual tasked with avoiding forces that you cannot stand against, similar to Amnesia: The Dark Decent. However Outlast pats itself on the back by indulging in some the most harrowingly grotesque visuals, and for a game released in 2013 I'm surprised it wasn't slapped with an Adult Only rating, especially with the displays of sexual violence, as well as regular displays of mutilation, there won't be a singular hallway or floor covered in mass amounts of viscera or blood which makes the the setting of Mount Massive Asylum not just more haunting, but memorable. Adding to the intense anxiety of the dark is your ""light source"", that being a camcorder with a night vision function, which really taps into films like Grave Encounters and The Blair Witch Project which is a creative decision I applaud for be frighteningly inventive, becoming a trademark of the series. You really can get lost in the worlds lore and visual storytelling, heavily backed by atmospheric sound design. These details are carried over wonderfully into it's expansion which on it's own is a great companion piece to the main game, often intersecting perfectly with Miles Upshur's story.

It's not doing anything particularly new, being a project that was conceptualized at the height of YouTube's love for Minecraft and the media's now well worn love for zombies, it's DNA thrived because of these moment's in our historical love for let's play's and the undead but now 11 years later it can proudly stand on it's own two feet. There's nothing more rewarding than rebuilding a destroyed structure into a ram-shackled safe haven, fulfilling all our post-apocalyptic day dreams of surviving on our own or with friends. I would say it's maybe a little more casual than say Project Zomboid, but that's not really a bad thing, it's unique in it's right, giving your far more freedom than the aforementioned comparison.

I may not be the most experimental player with me mostly preferring long swords and dual blades, but that only scratches the surface for the many options at your disposal ranging from bows, clubs, great swords, and instruments, which is further achieved by the numerous armor options you can obtain throughout your journey. I will say I hate the lack of a skip cut scene option since a LOT of cut scenes are painfully drawn out, so much so that I can prepare food in the interim while they play out. But besides that you will find a community of people that love playing together to take down big monsters with the promise of earning far greater gear, it's the ultimate practice of rewarding players for their hard work and it's truly intoxicating.

I played it near the end of it's Early Access life cycle and I know some people had listed some issues, some that at the time of writing this I personally don't recall, but I will say Endnight's matured a lot since the original, adding in features that have enriched the overall experience especially for my friend and I. To put it simply, at it's core it's still the forest, with a good facelift. Cannibal's no longer look woefully generic thanks to a lore reason that I will not disclose, but to give context that works as a good comparison, this is what The Lost World was to the original Jurassic Park, especially since your on ""Site 2"" this time around, making the comparison more legitimate, your not in the same location, but it's sister location, with horror's that we are quite familiar with, and like Todd Howard would put it ""it just works"" and just like The Lost World that game has a little more action with the inclusion of more modern equipment such as conventional firearm's which makes sense since again like The Lost World you play as a member of a mercenary group, not a survival savvy father figure which is a nice change, and yeah sometimes it may feel like it weakens the horror atmosphere due to those inclusions but I honestly welcome, it help's keep it fresh and interesting, even if you can just Indiana Jone's your way out of most confrontations with the flick of pistol or shotgun.

Conscript is a love child of 90s horror nostalgia with a twist, where instead of facing the unimaginable horrors of zombies or mutants, you're instead faced with the very real horror of WWI, a war that left a bloody mark in the history books as unforgiving and horrific, with enough causalities that would render a menial kill-streak from CoD as a joke. Young men sent to fight a grown-ups war, and Jordan Mochi capitalized on these themes with beautiful accuracy with all the hallmarks of old school survival horror in mind. Limited resources, puzzles, and enemies that you're better off avoiding. Hell the reason for me putting it off for long now was because I lost an hour and half of progress due to me trying to keep my ink pellets (ink ribbons from the OG Resident Evil) in stock. Conscript doesn't hold an punches, if you're familiar with the literary work ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" you will feel right at home, and for Jordan's first game it's a stand-out and welcomed surprise in the survival horror space, one that's original as well as paying homage to the classics that built the genre, I highly recommend it alone on those merits.",4.2 hrs on record,N/A

I am thankful for it because I believe this game deserves nothing but the highest accolades for narrative-driven horror. Still Wakes the Deep is a love letter to the claustrophobic nature of John Carpenter's The Thing, from the immense body horror, tightly packed space of the Beira D Oil Rig taking the place of Outpost 31, and most importantly, the well-rounded cast of characters making this Scottish rig feel like a grim but lively environment. The story is otherwise a horror-drama that is just The Thing on an Oil Rig, which by no means is an insult, it's quite perfect, especially since very few games have tried to replicate that outside of the official Thing game and Distrust. For its 6-hour length, you will see things so uniquely bizarre that I honestly will plug the concept artist Jef Wall here: https://www.zbrushcentral.com/t/still-wakes-the-deep-3d-concept-art/465425 I really wish we had a model viewer since the few monsters you do run into are so heavily covered in darkness or fog that you can't appreciate it that well, so hopefully that link can satiate that interest. On the other end of that, this game does feature moments where you need to face monsters and honestly, their scripted sections that don't last long and are quite easy to navigate for the most part, so for people expecting a Mr. X situation you don't need to worry, everything is purely situational and that's honestly fine. This is a narrative game, first and foremost, and it's some of the best writing I've seen for a game of this nature.

Ghost of Tsushima was a game I hadn't played before, so when the news broke that the game was coming to PC, I was excited since I believe good Samurai games are kinda rare nowadays, but I was unaware of Nixxes reputation for bad ports. The game tends to stutter, a lot, especially when doing basic actions like attacking, collecting, climbing, and switching between stances and equipment. I read that rebooting your PC corrects it, and although that may be true, it's only good for maybe an hour or so before the stuttering kicks in again. That's not my only issue, either. I'm unsure of how the game played on its native platform, but playing this game on PC with a controller is so weird and fussy that it's driving me crazy. I played around with the accessibility options, hoping it would mitigate the issue since I can't change my controller layout for some reason, but it doesn't. Pretty much in this game, LT and RT control your aiming, collecting, and stance changes, but it ALWAYS sticks when I pull my bow out. At first, I thought it was because of the auto-aim being enabled by default, so I disabled it, and it STILL sticks. I toggled the ""hold/toggle"" options to just a button press, but it STILL sticks no matter how lightly or quickly I press the button, and it really puts you in a tough spot when you're swarmed or just TRYING TO NAVIGATE. The first mission I used, the grappling hook, was a chore all because THE STANCE AND EQUIPMENT SCREEN WOULD NOT GO AWAY SINCE THEY SHARE THE SAME FRIGGIN' BUTTON!? Seriously what moron thought this would be a good design decision? To have what should be a basic function, no, a basic TASK, becomes a redundant chore at times because I have to actively micromanage this fussy design. It's so bad that I just stick with one quick item like the Kunai and actively AVOID using the bow unless I have enough distance between me and targets, but even firing the arrow is fussy, often sticking or auto-playing the animation until I press RT, which ALSO misfires and does its own thing sometimes. Listen I know that's a lot of stuff, but seriously it feels like the controls are actively working against you, and paired with the stuttering it becomes nauseating and frustrating trying to play the game sometimes, and from what's been reported it appears to be a memory leak issue so that means Nixxes needs to get on top of fixing that. For the controls, I might try playing with a keyboard and mouse going forward to see if that improves my experience a little, but overall, where I'm at in the plot just makes me wonder how this game lost to The Last of Us 2 because it's quite the experience both narratively and visually, and I hope Sony stops pigeon holding Sucker Punch and let them release their previous games on PC if that's possible.",29.2 hrs on record																					(17.5 hrs at review time),N/A

The original game had some shine to it but overall felt linear and not really rewarding, at least in my experience. RAGE 2 picks up several years later, now helmed by Avalanche Studios, the genius minds behind Just Cause and the kinda forgotten MAD MAX game, and where this game tries it hardest to seem unique and out of this world as it did with it's promotional material, which at the time really got a lot of us hyped however this game suffers from a fatal curse that often burdens most game made by Avalanche, unnecessary padding, or maybe it was just the style at the time? I say this as someone who enjoyed the first couple of hours of the game back in 2019, and after that ""honeymoon"" moment of euphoria ended all I felt was that this game has so many ""go here and there"" for almost nothing substantial unless its the weapons in this game which I can say are all great across the board, especially the shotgun, the thing feels like a damn cannon and it never gets old. But even with the stand-out missions and activities I felt like most of them were one and done, even with the incentives I just casually grind them out quickly, leaving me just feeling unsatisfied. I understand that it's an expansive open world game but the bombastic nature we were sold in advertisements are incredibly fleeting by comparison even with what's there you will probably learn the meta that the shotgun just trumps everything and the powers in conjunction with that certainly feel great especially with the Overdrive feature, I don't know, it just feels like the game is one of those rare examples of the middle ground review because the game can be fun from times, even if I get bored. It just never gets old jumping around like proper lunatic, turning ""goons"" into red paste swiftly, and moving along, but even then the fluff of the ever present map markers being indicators of ""trust"" like in Just Cause just got exhausting, after you have dismantled several of these ""events"" it just becomes monotonous fetch items to progress the story, even with the incentives.

Walking from point A to B is not fun nor is good game design, for exploration it makes sense but not being able to just fast travel to towns or cities turns what was immediately arduous walking into a chore, it's made even worse when you get swarmed by enemies out of nowhere, usually resulting in immediate death sending you back to an AUTOSAVE only, making me lose 30 minutes to an HOUR'S worth of progress. This isn't a matter of ""skill issues"" it's blatantly bad design that muddles the entire experience for me at least and it's messed up since I went in feeling positive only for things to change after my first Escort quest, because the quest took me to the other side of the map and the ONLY way to fast travel is through a rare object you can acquire by paying a large sum of money for, I understand their philosophy of ""pushing"" people to explore that world, but you can already do that in PLENTY of RPG's that still have fast traveling, it just feels like artificial padding to drag out the story TOO early for its own good.

There's no denying the legacy that this series holds, despite later endeavors sullying the incredible first entry (the second films ok imo), however Teyon again does something incredible by making Rogue City feel like a solid continuation of the overarching plot established in the original film and further emphasized in the subsequent second installment which is great since this game takes place between the second and third film something that is a saving grace for this game, because lets be real here, RC3 and after is largely forgettable. But even with all that table dressing how does the game hold up? I can say with certainty that this is probably the closest we will ever get to a RoboCop power fantasy, the games gory, RoboCop chugs along slowly, and Peter Weller keeps that monotone chrome voice as flat as ever, you really do feel like RoboCop, and I went as far as playing ""Red Rain"" by Peter Gabriel to get that cocaine lab effect that Peter Weller got, but the usual RoboCop theme works just as well, really selling the idea of you being a near unstoppable force, but outside of all the guns and glamor rests the themes of corporate greed, politics, and the loss of identity that is central to RoboCop as a character which was beautifully done, almost feeling like a horror game at points and these small breaks from the usual protecting and serving are not just welcoming but sobering for people that are already familiar with the story, and the emphasis on it really helps you connect to the your leading man. As I did briefly state gun-play is great all around, and getting to play with guns other than Robo's trusty Auto-9  does help mix things up even if it's only slightly, but the real meat and potato's comes from the upgrading system that effects both Robo individually and his sidearm. You can freely upgrade your Auto-9 to be a fully automatic shotgun pistol that amplifies the gore and *sometimes* causes explosions and yeah that does sound dumb but hey it's suppose to be an action movie so why not go a little nuts? However my biggest grip about this game has to probably be the lack of a New Game+ mode. By the time I finished the game I was barely even close to leveling all of Robo's abilities, along with maxing out the Auto-9 to my preferences. I think after 10-15 hours of play I think players would like to go back fully maxed out to really revel in the mayhem that I enjoyed, or at least go back for secrets, because circuits for the pistol can be merged but it's kinda of just this is what you get and that's that, if you were an idiot like me and merged all your circuits together hoping to get just the right piece to max your stats. And I get it, Teyon is relatively small but for all we know they might add additional content later on down the road since they did that with their previous entries, even their first foray, that being Rambo.

It was a survival horror game that was being directed by none other than Shinji Mikami, the essential Godfather of Survival Horror, and I'll be honest that back then I didn't really understand this game at first but now with a newer appreciation I can say that Shinji Mikami made his own version of Inception with a lot of inspiration from his Japanese roots. Without going deep into spoiler territory, I can say this game wrestles and plays with the idea of your mind being twisted, and tested trying to make sense of a world that seemingly shouldn't exist. And with that in mind Shinji took a note from the late great Team Silent and made use of symbolism although in a relatively fleeting manner. But when you sit back and take it in, it's truly an interesting experience that depending on how you feel may have either aged well or poorly, and personally I say it's a little mediocre but functional, and if you really want to make a proper excuse you could say it's antiquated feel could very well be intentional, adding on a touch of anxiety for players trying to survive.

Hell the controls and story aren't even the thing I hate the most, but more importantly the obscene amount of references it has packed into nearly every corner. It got to the point where I felt like the devs were taking the piss but in the end I guess it feels like they needed to have pop-culture seeping out of every orifice just out of fear that the games content couldn't hold a players interest. It has some cool ideas such has having two forms of reloading just to heighten some form of anxiety related to your resource management but even then that falls short. Big negatives are the obscenely small inventory, the prolonged death animations of enemies that result in wasting my ammunition, the lack of variety in enemies, the poorly constructed puzzles that left me and my friend stumped (the fountain puzzle is the biggest offender), and most importantly the reason that stopped me from finishing the game, the final boss. Where in your right mind do you get off on making a boss that on paper has a simple way of facing them only to subvert the simplicity with a section that relies on tired old gimmicks that result in an insta kill. I read some forums which had fans essentially saying ""git gud"" but HOW!? Essentially the final boss at first is in a simple arena where you have a near infinite amount of pistol ammo to beat him down ONLY to face him again in a hallway where you need to run away from him. Hell I got so far ahead of him I thought it was broken NOPE. Once you reach your destination of an elevator that you need to wait for he comes rushing to you like a damn linebacker and instantly kills you. I tried four more times, trying to evade him, hell I STUNNED HIM and he still kills me. I understand that the game was made by a small team of ten people but you can't tell me that you play-tested that section and said ""yeah this is perfect"". It's shoddy game design that just like the boss in question insta killed my already fleeting interest in your game, and I honestly don't care if my review is a ""hot take"" to the fist full of fans that might say its ""good game design"" when it's blatantly not.",10.8 hrs on record,N/A

But now that we're in 2023 a lot of things have happened that we never really expected, such as there being a sequel that quickly divided fans and a show that brought them back together. This remake serves as a great starting point for people that never played it back in 2013, but more importantly, it's a remake that players like me can properly cherish for the updated visuals and animations that we're marred/handicapped by the 6th and 7th generation of console hardware. However, one major thing that stunts this game from being ‚Äúperfect‚Äù is that it's still a game from 2013, which isn't exactly a point against it, but it definitely shows occasionally.

Phantom Pain is often regarded as an entry that keeps its head held high despite the behind the scenes nonsense that forced the series creator Hideo Kojima to be axed, forfeiting his ownership of the IP. Yeah, yeah, this is a review, but I always open most reviews with things that should be brought up. But what does Phantom Pain do that makes it stand tall? It's a complete reinvention of the series mainstays that fans and first timers will adore, stealth is now at its best, combat is challenging but rewarding even if it's the most intense it's ever been, at least for me. But I can't deny how obnoxious the monetization and live service features are, they are so heavily integrated into the game that it make the experience repetitive real quick. Even with my almost 50hrs of playtime I acknowledge how dry it can get, especially with a lot of cookie cutter mission structures that, yes, *can* be fun but once you've played missions that start to stink of this repetition you may also begin to drag your feet a little. But even then, this game still has the Kojima charm that I just can't fault.

It's ok, it's good mindless fun where it needs to be, but at the same time it seems to be a step back in some places from its predecessor. To be fair, the first Dying Light wasn't ground breaking neither. It was good mindless fun where it was needed, but it kept everything at ground level, where it's core feature of parkour really benefitted. I feel that the devs really wanted to go for a more vertical RPG experience that often left me feeling a little unfulfilled early on, and yeah expecting everything to connect in the first two hours is a TALL order but by the time you acquire all the Night runner tools it does start to feel better, but the sensation is very minimal. I will say I don't get tired of braining zombies, and the near complete removal of firearms is such a godsend for a game that feels more medieval in its presentation, relying on melee weapons, bows, and throwing weapons helps reinforce the post-apocalypse ninja vibes Techland was going for. But even then the game still tends to drag in some parts and the faction system could have been done a lot better, personally I sided with more militant PKs over the selfish survivors but then again both sides parallel two different thought processes, it's just that to me one side seems more realistic and beneficial to my play style.

There is no denying the legacy that San Andreas holds, especially almost 20 years later, but you also can't deny the hap hazard way that Grove Street Games went about remastering this game, and it's prior titles. At it's core it's still the same old story of gang warfare, and corruption that every buster knows by now, it just wears a botched skin job that very loosely ‚Äúre-invigorates‚Äù it. I haven't had any problems while playing the game, and for the most part I have had some fun, even if the AI for enemies is on par to that of a lobotomite, I mean seriously you can get enemies to funnel into a choke point, and they will mindlessly keep walking into your line of sight just to get shot. But my real crux of this review is to throw heavy shade at Grove Street Games. I honestly believe they shouldn't have been involved with this project, especially now that we know that they resorted to using a number cruncher to artificially smooth out every little imperfection. Resulting in a lot of geometric calamities that reek of incompetence. They should stick to their own self-made project or go through a heavy revamp of leadership.

The Citadel has been touted as Waifustein and I can admit that it's a fitting title since it hits on all those hallmarks of that genre defining title, and I really can't find anything wrong with the formula of the game. It doesn't overstay it's welcome, the guns feel great, and you get some great moments where you feel like a badass that is on the same level as Aeon Flux, dominatrix gear included. However, if you are expecting a somewhat forgiving experience, I must warn you that you will not find it here. Dying will lead to a complete level restart, UNLESS you find one of the checkpoints that are scarcely included in a few levels. Also, I will say the final level is mediocre. There's no real final boss but a gauntlet of enemies concluding in a pitiful ‚Äúcongrats player character you win‚Äù.

I could ignorantly complain about small things and question the merits of remakes or just review game and be completely honest, and obviously I'm choosing the latter. Resident Evil 2 set a very high bar for remakes and the subsequent Resident Evil 3 was quite the disappointment for me and many others and obviously to have two games one good, and one bad there was definitely a lot riding on this remake such as will it be good? Or will be a massive disappointment. Thankfully I can my expectations were positively shattered. Resident Evil 4 is not just a good remake but also a near reinvention of the source that almost makes it hard for me to want to return to the original, and yes I know that those are some BIG words for a game with such a massive legacy but honestly it's the truth. Granted, it's never going to replace the original, that's a given but this is a more accessible and modern rendition that fans and new comers will enjoy. Granted I do have *some* gripes, some that are probably going to be laughed at but I feel they are fair none the less. For starters there's no Mercenaries mode at least at the time of writing this, it will come out on April 7th of this year but because of it's absence some unlockable weapons have been given new constraints in order for you to unlock them such as the Chicago Typewriter needing to be unlocked by playing Professional and achieving an ""A"" rank or higher, and the much coveted Handcannon being unlocked by playing a new game on Professional WITHOUT using bonus weapons, and that's all fine and good since I don't mind a challenge but I always enjoyed earning the Handcannon through Mercs simply because I found it more rewarding but that's my opinion, and honestly my only real complaint. Resident Evil 4 has been resurrected like the ghouls of old, with the early game focusing on more atmospheric horror that feels at home with the likes of the Blair Witch Project, but slowly but surely you will be faced with more action heavy fair that benefits from the more weighty and punchy gun-play first introduced in Resident Evil 2's remake.

Volcanoids is an example of the former. When I first saw this game, I saw it on TikTok of all things and I said to myself ‚Äúman that seems cool‚Äù, and unsurprisingly it is. The premise is simple. You're on an island inhabited by a bunch of robots with the goal of uncovering the cause of the island's frequent eruptions, which in itself is a great gameplay feature that eventually becomes a part of your well managed routine. A friend and I spent 11hrs, in total, upgrading our ship and sabotaging others with the intention of uncovering the secrets of the island. Obviously, since the game is in early access, there are a few issues I faced such as hit detection with some flying enemies and being able to survive an eruption topside by hiding in the buggy waters.

Of course not, especially since modding kept all three alive for the better part of 20 years. But I can say it's sort of cool playing these games with updated visuals, even if the quality varies significantly. Vice City was one of my favorite entries in this series simply because of the music and 80s atmosphere, but one can't deny that the game aged in both a good way and bad way and despite the middling effort put in by Grove Street Games, I can say what you're getting is a generic remaster that looks as rubbery and fake like Madonna's botoxed face, which is honestly the best comparison I can make. Underneath all that synthetic enhancement lies the original in all of its untouched glory, but you still need to deal with what's been added or subtracted. For the most part, it's still fun and also a lot more forgiving than the original to a degree, but some music was removed due to contracts/licenses and a lot of imagery from more modern R* games being added which feels painfully anachronistic, and yeah I know, it's a fictional adaption of a real place, but couldn't more care have been taken in recreating it?

Admittedly I haven't played the previous games in the series, but I have seen the anime adaption of the first entry which I do recommend for people that are looking for a loose but faithful adaption of the source. To put it bluntly, this game has you playing as the most badass but edgy anime protagonist ever created, Beyond the Grave is his name and mulching goose-stepping punks is his game. Armed with his pistols, Cerberus, and lugging his coffin the Death Hauler, Grave is equal parts Desperado and Frankenstein, which is the highest honor you could give to a man like him. Throughout my almost 5 hours, the objective was simple. Kill everything or in this game's own words ‚ÄúKick their Ass"" which you will probably do with absolute glee. There is a story here but don't expect it to be some groundbreaking story with a moral lesson to learn, it's simple set dressing for Grave to kill thugs in droves and honestly that's all you really need.

But he we are in 2023 a year where three of the biggest horror games are getting a substantial remake with Dead Space being the first. And after playing through it twice all I can say is Motive not only knocked it out of the park, they raised bar to what I can now consider a very high standard. This remake is almost a 1:1 remake but just barely in that regard. Motive took the foundation set by the first two games and reshaped it into something that not only feels like a celebration of the original but also the extended lore as a whole with fan theories being acknowledged along with the films and spin-offs like Extraction which at this point I would take a handsome remake of that as long as Motive is working on it, hell I'll take it as a full fledged expansion if that's the case.

I think of the late 2000s era Gameinformers and all of their little one-off games they advertised, I remember the Christmas morning that I got a PS3, and most importantly I remember the depressing era of gaming where games tried hard to corner a market of tactical shooters that had drab color pallets and edgy hero's, and Dark Sector is no exception to that criteria. Funny enough, without Dark Sector we wouldn't have the incredibly popular Warframe since the early design of Dark Sector looked a lot like present day Warframe, even if it was a little darker. I would consider Dark Sector an obscure classic that does suffer from some modern technical issues that are pretty present with games from 2008, but if you can get it working, I think you will find a pretty fun experience that does feel a little generic here and there thanks to it trying to meet industry standards of the time, but despite it feeling generic I find to be an experience that works in the grand scheme of things.

But I will commend them on a few things before I really go for the jugular. The team at Striking Distance knows how to build an intriguing game world that for some may truly feel desolate but for me not entirely claustrophobic like Dead Spaces planet cracker, but Callisto's Black Iron Prison feels like it would be at home in the 2000 AD universe with Judge Dredd patrolling the cell blocks, ready to crack an inmates skull with a baton, hell I would go as far to say that the weapons you use in this game could be used by a Judge from *that* universe and the team that worked on developing those weapons deserve a round of applauds. But now my jugular tearing critique. This game may have *some* callbacks to Dead Space with its minimal hood and heavy use of dismemberment but Jesus Christ this game is nothing more but an overly cinematic ""horror"" game that barely thrills or scares, not to mention that at launch the damn performance was far scarier than the overall experience that was presented. When I say this game is overly cinematic I mean it because I'm not sure if the dev team was trying to win any awards in regard to animations but it certainly feels like it because every little action you perform accompanied by almost over-exaggerated follow through animation. Healing gets a prolonged animation that does you NO favors in combat, granted it can mitigated by stomping on corpses for potential healing kits that work instantly but still your character goes through this whole song and dance routine of kneeling, inserting, then injecting themselves with a syringe. It is so unnecessarily long that it is about 7-8 seconds long. Weapon switching isn't some instant affair either. Because all of the weapons work off of a universal frame system you are treated to a prolonged animation of your character switching out the receiver for a new weapon, it's reminded me a lot of Homefront: The Revolution but even those animations weren't super long even though here it's not as long as healing. And Jesus the amount of times you need to crawl through a small space in this game damn near kills me even though it is infrequent but none the less you're subjected to a long ass animation of your character crawling or squeezing through a tight gap, it got to a point where it just felt like artificial length to make the game feel longer. Combat also suffers from this weird fixation on cinematic animations. This game has a big focus on melee combat, so much so that dodging perfectly leads to a brief slow down so you can ogle at your ability to strafe left or right oh so perfectly and THEN you can clobber the plug ugly punk that stands between you and your precious animations. But all jokes aside combat just boils down to beating monsters with a stun baton that I dubbed the silly stick while dodging left, right, or holding back to block which I NEVER used but hey if you're good at laying down combos you can stun an enemy for an opportune moment to shoot them. I would mention the GRP which is just the kinesis from Dead Space but I rarely used it unless I wanted to get a crate or score a quick kill. But even with all this laid out combat is painfully basic. I would go into another tangent about the ludicrous animations mainly with getting weapon upgrades but I feel like you get the point, this game uses a lot of animations that just bring gameplay to a stand still sometimes and it could be argued that it's suppose to raise tension or make things feel more dynamic than they should but it just feels infuriating. I don't feel scared or anxious, I'm just annoyed and the ending to this game adds more fuel to the fire because despite enjoying some sections of this game I don't feel the need to play it again because for some weird reason this game did NOT launch with a new game+ mode, and I am aware that it will be added later but just the absence of this kills any type of longevity early on for this game and the ending just feels like sequel/DLC bait. I won't lie I bought the season pass even though it's a practice I find quite abhorrent (hypocritical I know) but with that in mind I swear to god if the true ending is sold as DLC I will rain fire and brimstone because although that practice has been done before and almost anyone can agree that it's a stupid tactic that really should NOT be done especially with a game with so much great production value.

Vermintide and its subsequent sequels were both set in the more fantasy driven Age of Sigmar where black powder was frequent but sharp or blunt instruments are favored but Darktide does away of the near exclusivity of melee reliance and instead features ""hybrid"" combat where guns and blades aplenty are used fairly equally, and just like its predecessor you can choose from character class that fits your play style and so far from my experience in the beta to official launch Veteran and Ogryn are quite satisfying, and I don't doubt the Zealot and Psyker will fall short in regard to satisfaction since mulching members of the plague is quite the sloppy affair of clubbing heads and tearing them to bits with gun fire. But even with this fantastic display of ultra violence, I do feel like I need to break away to critique something that has been mentioned a lot in forums and the reviews. Microtransactions. A word that can obviously sting like vinegar, depending on who you are. For me, I'm mostly indifferent since I couldn't care less about cosmetic microtransactions however after careful thinking and realizing I will say that the in-game cash shop being available at launch instead of including features that are ""coming soon"" can be quite disheartening to some especially since you can't get an accurate amount of aquila's (premium currency) in your bundles supposedly. As someone who bought the Imperial Edition I can say see how others that made the same decision may be upset by the absence of crafting, re-rolling traits, and other significant hallmarks that were introduced in Vermintide especially when Darktide already feels significantly grindy and heavy with RNG. But my best advice is, don't buy cosmetics or don't spend money on Aquila's. As someone who shrugs their shoulders to that sort of thing I'm not impacted by it, but I understand how it can be seen as an abysmal business practice, I'm not going to downplay that. Also with FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) in mind since the cosmetics are in rotation like Fortnite skins, honestly I don't feel like you're missing much since I doubt anyone is going to care about how you're dressed in the game because I certainly don't. For Fatshark I recommend you do away with these timed cosmetics since even in Vermintide that didn't exist, you could freely select from any premium cosmetic you wanted. Also, maybe do away with the special currency system and just fall back to how you did it in Vermintide with using your Steam wallet, that would save a lot of headaches honestly. In general, I feel like Darktide is a literal bloody good time, and the amount of times I and a friend were laughing at the ensuing chaos of bloodthirsty hordes being flattened by an Ogryn's boots and clubs is enough for me to recommend it.",106.4 hrs on record																					(26.7 hrs at review time),N/A

Despite my issues with the main game, I thought it was ok for the most part. By no means does it trump Resident Evil 7, but it did ok at continuing Ethan's story. So when I heard that this expansion was coming out, I had no real expectations. I enjoyed most of the DLCs from RE7 because they were all little side stories that were sizable enough that I wasn't really disappointed by their length because they ALL did something different. However, the Winter's Expansion excels at being a disappointment. The real meat and potatoes of this expansion was supposed to be Shadows of Rose, an expansion that follows a teenage Rose Winters, Ethan's daughter and key focus of the main game. So you may be wondering, how is it? To put it bluntly it's the most wishy-washy and unnecessary thing you could have paid for and upon doing some further reading this was originally cut content. Granted they say this was ""inspired"" by cut content, but I'm just going to call it as it is because THEY RE-USE THE FINAL CUTSCENE OF THE FRIGGIN' GAME! Not only is that lazy, but it goes to show that the integrity of this was so weak that they had to re-use a LOT of assets just to ship it for 20 dollars. And I could just leave the review there and say wait for a sale, and honestly you should. But I need to discuss what this expansion brings, even if it's so very little. Unlike the main game, SOR is played from a third-person perspective which is ok I guess, doesn't really bother me. But what does bother me is the pointless inclusion of Rose's powers which are just dropped in on a whim to try and mix things up but even then they mean so very little from a gameplay perspective. All they do is clear paths, get you out of grapples, and temporarily stun enemies, and that is it, nothing more, nothing less they are quite literally the most needless inclusion. Weapons have been trimmed down to just the starting pistol and shotgun which you don't have for long because after going through the castle section you get to repeat the haunted manor section with its own Rose flavoring of creepy and that entire section takes up the MAJORITY of this expansion's run time and if you read my review on the main game I ranted about the games pacing a little and I never really clarified, but the manor slows the main game to a crawl for me but to pad what feels like the majority of the story just annoyed the hell out of me. And by the time it's over it feels like you're running a New York minute all the way to the end, and it ends in the most unsatisfying way only to be backed with the same ending cutscene from the main game. Overall, SOR took me *maybe* three hours. Yes it's an expansion, I'm not expecting another eight hour long story mode, but for 20 dollars it feels like you get cheated a little. Granted, Shadows of Rose isn't the only thing that was included. You can now play the main game in third person, and they added three new characters to Mercenaries. Chris Redfield, Karl Heisenberg, and Lady D (the internet's vampire mommy) and for the most part it is fun playing as these new characters because they function entirely different from Ethan.

When I reviewed the first game, I made sure to list a lot of what made the game feel so painfully janky/antiquated. So, what did The Witcher 2 improve? Honestly, it made a lot of excellent changes and some questionable ones. Granted I want to preface this review with the idea that this game was released in 2011, a time when a lot of trends infected games such as QTEs and rather saturated appearances which is the case for this game, but I can sort of let that slide since again 2011 was ripe with that kind of design and aesthetic and if it wasn't for the vastly improved combat and superb writing that CDPR has become known for I could probably shrug my shoulders, but I won't. The combat in this game is a MAJOR improvement from its predecessor, and honestly I think fans of that game can agree that it's probably one of the most divisive combat systems for a game which yes, I got use to but even adjusting to it barely gives it a pass for criticism. The combat in W2 is by in large functional, but not overly complicated. They decided to introduce movement that flowed well in large areas and with this movement came a better flow when it came to using swords, magic, and throwing weapons like bombs and newly added knives. You could pretty much jump between enemies rather fluently, striking them from behind, landing a critical hit or stunning them for an insta kill that gives you a cinematic kill animation as per 2011 standards. Overall, it feels more lively than the static sit in place and slap an enemy until it eventually dies method introduced in the prior game, essentially having you embody some of Geralts movements, which is refreshing. One thing that does bug me the most is how they handled potions. Previously it was a juggling act where you could take potions at your own leisure with the caveat being you gain toxicity meaning you had to balance whether you wanted to have a slight edge over enemies or just heal vs slowly poisoning yourself. It was a great risk vs reward system since despite Geralt being a mutant he still had a sense of mortality in regard to his potion consumption. Whether you just drank a few and had a disoriented effect on your screen or really push it and just straight die from potion toxins, it was something you REALLY needed to be mindful of during gameplay because if you lost track you could have just killed yourself without noticing. So how is it handled in W2? It's painfully watered down and reduced to a feature you can ONLY use during meditation. No more freewheeling and drinking potions when you wanted to, you had to do it before any sort of encounter which to be fair is maybe more fitting to Geralt since he would realistically drink them beforehand, allowing him to measure something without the risk of overdosing, but even that is nonexistent. As I mentioned, you could die from drinking too many potions, now the toxin meter just serves as a gauge or allowance of what you can drink without any risk. You can pretty much select up to three potions and call it a day, or if you spec into alchemy you can take an additional one, but even then there's no real risk in drinking potions. Throughout my almost 40hr run I reserved myself to only three potions because they maxed out my toxin meter and were the most effective, the only handicap being that I had to take them before doing anything else, which is my biggest gripe with how the potion system works. The last bit I wanted to stress is the story, which by all means is great! And what makes it so good is I guess the more simplified paths you can take, one being obviously good and the other being bad, but they all meet at the same point but on different sides of the wall so to speak. Whether you side with Vernon Roche or Iorveth, they don't come close to the lead villain Letho of Gulet, I swear I wish he had more screen time because his VA Mark Lewis Jones kills it with his somehow even more hoarse voice making Geralt's voice sound mediocre. Honestly, I would love a game where we can play as Letho, a character that is more morally corrupt and brutal than Geralt, even though he has shades of humanity. And honestly (SPOILER) I recommend sparing him at the end, yes it throws away a climatic boss fight but by doing this, he will appear in The Witcher 3 when you import your save . All in all, despite the weird choices made with W2 it's a major improvement from its predecessor and the fact that you can import your save data from the first game makes it feel more like a direct continuation of Geralt's story and for that alone I highly recommend it.",38.7 hrs on record,N/A
76561198045196300,5,N/A,Recommended,"This is a review that's been three years in the making and to you, you're probably wondering ""why does that matter"".  To put it bluntly, the original Witcher is a uniquely ambitious game with a very antiquated and frustrating gameplay loop that for most modern gamers will be a little intimidating, especially if your introduction to this series was either the second or third game. But despite that frustration, The Witcher is probably one of the most engrossing and rewarding RPG experiences I have played in recent memory, due to the fact that it works as foreshadowing for the next installments with references to The Wild Hunt, a cliffhanger that leads into the second game, and reference for what may come in the recently announced fourth game. It's remarkable that CDPR planned out this universe from the get go, and for that alone I commend them for that level of ambition and effort, especially since you can import your save from this game into the second, creating a seamless story. It's a narrative marvel that carries this game, and it's further elevated with the branching paths and decisions you can make, and yeah in 2022 that may not sound remarkable but back in 2008 it was, and to have those actions brought up in the following game is also great. But enough gushing about the story and narrative beats. I need to lay into the negative, which is the thing that may push people away. To put it bluntly, the combat in this game is janky, unremarkable, and sometimes dreadful on occasions. I understand that back in 2008 CDPR probably didn't have the resources to streamline the combat, or they were trying to go for a traditional but ""unique"" take, but even that statement can't pad out or excuse how bad it is. Essentially, combat boils down to whether you're going to fight monsters or humans and even though the former is more common you still fight humans just as much, and I state this because you carry two swords, silver for monsters, and steel for humans, it's a staple of the franchise that no fan can forget but when both weapons have their own separate skill trees for all three fighting styles you are left feeling a little stuck between which to invest in, at least I did, because as stated you have three fighting styles that are tailored for certain situations. These styles are self-explanatory in concept, but poor in delivery, Strong is for the big uglies that need an extra bit of a wallop to put down, fast is for the nimble freaks you can't hit with your regular brute strength, and group is for when you're completely surrounded and singling out individual foes is not an option. Execution of these styles boils down to standing still, clicking on them, and waiting for your mouse to light up indicating when to score a hit or link a combo, essentially boiling down to this tedious song and dance of stationary @$$ whoopin' that can get a little tiresome and most definitely can take you out of the action. Spells/signs are another feature that in theory sound cool but honestly boil down to you most likely using two (or three) out of the five given spells, and that's what I usually did. Either resorting to Aard which functions as a force push that stuns enemies or Igni which is your stock standard fire spell, I did use Quen sometimes which gives you a temporary bubble shield but when you have potions that almost trivialize some of the combat I don't really feel like it's necessary in most cases. The other two spells are Yrden is a trap spell that repels enemies and Axii is a mind control ability that makes enemies passive for the most part, but again I never used those two since I could easily repel enemies with a well-placed Aard blast or Igni blast. All in all the combat is weird and definitely the one thing I struggled with early game because from the get go you don't have a silver blade, and you only have the bare minimum of combat skills to manage threats and as I started off saying both silver and steel blades don't have a shared skill tree but instead separate trees for each respective fighting style. So if you were putting a lot of points into silver blade's strong, fast, and group, you have handicapped yourself when you finally fight humans which to me is annoying but from a narrative standpoint may make sense I guess but then again it's just that one thing that otherwise makes an already semi-frustrating system worse, however you can get use to it with time and by the midpoint of the game I got pretty good at quickly switching between the styles, so it's not *too* hard, but it's definitely an ambitious and janky mess that I grew to appreciate over time. Other than the combat being weird, I adore a lot of the world building, alchemy systems, mini-games, even if both of them are just glorified quests with one being unrepeatable after each phase's completion. This game oozes with the kind of creativity you want from an RPG and for this being CDPR's first major game it was a big undertaking to make everything work almost seamlessly and that alone makes this game worthwhile. I highly recommend The Witcher.",39.0 hrs on record,N/A

I know that's probably a weird sentence since this is a remaster of a sequel to a game released in 2005, but in this context, I think it works. Just like my review for the remaster of the first game, Black Forest Games has again done a real bang up job and translating the original '06 release of Destroy All Humans! 2 to a more modern engine as well as a modern audience, pretty much all the dialogue from the original has been carried over with updated visuals, slightly updated combat that is basic but enjoyable, updated character models that are just as cartoony as the previous game, and most importantly the overhauled destruction makes a triumphant return. I will say I did run into some small bugs this time around with minor soft-locking, but it's nothing too substantial that can't be easily patched out, I also did crash from time to time so take that into consideration.

Bringing us the original Star Wars Battlefront series, Mercenaries, the criminally underrated The Saboteur, and of course Destroy All Humans! I admit in modesty that when I was a kid I didn't really understand the humor too much due to being a bright-eyed 6-year-old, but I do remember a lot of the pivotal moments and all I can say is that this remaster translates everything from the original 2005 release near flawlessly, even going as far as adding a cut mission to mix it up a little bit. I also have to commend Black Forest Games for keeping a lot of the original jokes and subject-matter in the game. Furthermore, I also need to praise how every character model is stylized in a more cartoony manner this time around, completely doing away with the realistic depiction we got back in '05, hell even some of the more graphic sound effects were changed to be a little goofier. But my biggest praise for this game is how Black Forest overhauled the destruction in this game. My biggest memory from the original was seeing the unlockable concept art depicting your death ray cutting a building in half and now in 2022 it's pretty much a reality with building flinging debris in every direction when they are hit, having smoke and dust engulf the surrounding area, buildings collapsing into dozens of different pieces, and trees and grass become scorched when struck with a death ray. It's just these little environmental changes that make this remake feel like a more fully realized project and I feel that the original team would have tears in their eyes seeing how their product was reanimated and reinvented with this remaster, and honestly I feel like this remaster should set an example for a lot of companies on how to do a proper remaster.",12.6 hrs on record,N/A

It feels organic and as one critic said feels less ""gamey"" all because it acknowledges your progress and failures going as far as having characters comment on your runs and how you died you FEEL like you're growing in power all because you have a motivating story and a logical reason for why things get randomized. I also wanted to comment on Jen Zee's brilliant interpretation of all of the Greek gods since they are astounding and such a marvel to interact with and the actors behind these characters really brought them to life which again adds to the organic feel. They're not just a bunch of selfish gods that follow the same time of personality they are all varied and likable and if it was possible I would love a game that just follows the Olympic Gods just on the principle of how enjoyable they are.

My biggest criticism for this game has to be the rather repetitive nature of the game as a whole. Understandably playing friends may make this seem quaint but honestly it makes the ""mid-game"" dull. I use mid-game loosely since the entire game revolves around hunting V Blood type characters so you can upgrade your character and castle but when you're stuck with the same gear for what is currently marked as 10hrs for me it definitively could turn some people off. Also the inability to teleport while carrying materials is a little obnoxious and it seems to be a trend with some survival games such as Valheim. I understand that the devs want you to explore but when my only driving force for exploration is only for hunting people it comes off as needless backtracking that stiffens the experience.

76561198045196300,6,N/A,Recommended,"Back in 2020 I was brimming with excitement regarding the announcement of this remake for very obvious reasons. Resident Evil 2 got a generally well received remake that for the most part captured the exact same essence of the original, but with some added flair regarding its atmosphere, which was pumped with steroids. So how does this remake fair? Well when I went into it back in 2020 I had, I guess, unreal expectations. But when I heard that almost universally, a lot of fans felt the way I did, I knew I was justified with saying this game was disappointing. Don't get me wrong, it still has the beautiful modern grunge that made the RE2 remake work so well, but no amount of visual glimmer can mask what feels like a glorified expansion. Granted the original RE3 was often regarded by some as a sort of ‚Äúexpansion‚Äù or ‚Äúspin-off‚Äù but coming hot off of RE2's heels I and many others expected a more opened up/expanded RE2 experience with the one of franchise's favorite baddies Nemesis who looks great in this game but is sorely underutilized, and instead feels like a more scripted Mr. X. Also this game features a LOT of cuts, and when I mean cuts I mean the complete omission of certain parts of the original game like the park and clock tower. I have heard vague rumors that a director's cut was planned to be released, but that rumors hold very little credence to me since it hasn't been confirmed by any official sources. What's even more laughable is how mercenaries was cut, possibly in favor of Resident Evil Resistance, the online game mode that *had* a roadmap that was quickly abandoned. But what's my verdict?

Sadly that recap is the only concise bit of storytelling you will get from this game. I understand that Chris Darril has a vision for this series especially since from what I read he planned on making a trilogy from this IP but after playing Broken Porcelain I honestly don't know how a trilogy would be possible since the story now feel closed and shut.

The fact that I had to rely on an external source to better understand a congested story that feels like its riding an express flight to the conclusion just screams bad story telling but the fact that the RECAP for the previous game does a better job at explaining things just further boggles my mind. Story aside the gameplay? Jesus Christ HOW DO YOU RUIN BASIC GAMEPLAY!? Objectives sometimes never make sense, features are introduced only to be used once or twice, the gameplay loop of being chased is clunky and more frustrating than scary especially since hiding NEVER works, and the idea of upgrading your character is a throwaway idea that I rarely used.

I reacquired Greedfall from a humble bundle choice I believe and due to me pining for an RPG experience I decided to give it a more thorough try. And my thoughts now are that of genuine enjoyment. Yes the game is not perfect, not by a long shot and I believe that's just the curse I feel with most games published by Focus Home Interactive, but most of their games do have a shine to them. Greedfall is a game that doesn't spoil it's player early on and treats your decisions of skill choice seriously. I was immediately turned off originally in that regard feeling a sense of FOMO, but after just getting over it (there's a whole entire game beyond just the intro obviously) I was rewarded with an RPG that feels contextual in the rewarding sense. In more recent RPG they follow a very similar pattern of being free to go anywhere of course, at least with my examples being mostly Bethesda games like Fallout and Skyrim, but Greedfall punishes you for trying to go in barrel chested, treating you like someone that NEEDS to go about things carefully and at your own pace early on, a pace that happily forces you to engage in conspiracies relevant to your characters position. Some of the quests I have encountered early on excel at dressing the world with it's lore, a world of colonization, religious conversion, and nobility overtaking native lands while the very same natives try to repel them in an attempt to preserve their world, and it's a nice change up from your typical position in RPGs where your some rogue warrior of some ancient capacity or a survivalist, you're a legate tasked with representing Merchants, and you usually should try to resort to diplomacy most of the time but when combat does come into play it does feel pretty grounded and entertaining, feeling like a witch hunter from the Warhammer universe in some aspects, but early on you do feel heavily outnumbered if you invested points into skills than combat. But than again I have a whole game ahead of me. The level cap is 90 and there's plenty to do even if it can become quite repetitive especially where I'm at now. The game stinks of patience in a good way because I believe once you look past the things that might initially turn you off, you will eventually find an RPG that's on par with Dragon Age, just with more witch hunter aspects.

Vampyr displays its fangs with pride since you are often tempted with whether or not you should or shouldn't feed on the innocent and its a feature that plays well into the morality of fighting being either a man or beast especially in early 20th century London at the peak of the Spanish flu. It's a game that handles this subject matter with grace and the treatment of the vampiric subject is handled equally as well since feeding is treated as more of a travesty instead of some graceful act of gothic embrace.

As a lover of horror films I can see the influences of several different films mainly being The Descent and a little bit of Cannibal Holocaust. The game is definitely a terrifying experience when you play alone but the addition of multiplayer kinda makes it into an average survival horror experience but that's okay if I'm going to be fair. Despite the positives its still a janky mess but a fun mess and hopefully Endnight Games vastly improves on what made this game good in the upcoming sequel.,35.8 hrs on record																					(30.2 hrs at review time),N/A

Back then I had ignored all the entries after Unity because I felt like the series had reached its point. But since I have been binging the series for review purposes I didn't know what to expect from Origins. I remember back in 2017 I scoffed saying that the series seemed desperate, especially since they were going to Egypt a locale that I thought could NOT be interesting. And all I need to say is that younger me was an absolute moron because Assassins Creed Origins is a breathe of fresh air that had me smiling from start to finish because even though this is an Assassins Creed game I often forgot I was playing one which I think is its greatest strength along with an absolutely lovable protagonist. This game proves that giving a series an extended break not only allows new ideas to be breed but for them to be refined, which this game graciously reeks of.

76561198045196300,8,N/A,Recommended,"I usually don't make reviews unless I have either played a considerable amount of the game or have finished it but in the case of Assassin's Creed Unity I need to write this review early and sadly its gonna be negative which honestly I don't want to do because there's definitely a lot of great ideas flowing through this game but they can't save what feels like a slow burn that never ignites the same joy previous entries brought. To give a little bit of an explanation for this series, ever since Assassin's Creed 2 the series has seen a yearly release schedule and at the time of its release, Unity was the 7th commercially released entry in the series which is awfully fitting since it made its debut on the 7th generation consoles but at this point, the series began to feel a little long in the hidden blade if you catch my drift. This game was ambitious. And this ambition is what kinda led to its downfall in a way. I don't think it's as bad as people make it out to be but it's certainly not great. However even with its ambition it really feels like an amalgam of previous ideas that have been updated for the then news consoles/audience. I love the idea of separate pieces of armor affecting your stats lending a light RPG feel to the game, I love the visuals even if by 2021 they are painfully dated to an extent. What I don't like is how they really tried to step out of the safety netting that previous installments had set. The parkour is by far the weakest and most cumbersome I've had to deal with. Gone is the seamless simplicity of the ""Revolution"" titles but this weird ""state-of-the-art"" bull crap that complicates movement for me at least. I will play this game to completion but for what its worth this game just feels bland and life-less. Where you should have reinvented the wheel you did and where you shouldn't have you did but you failed. I feel like the Ubisoft Hubris was broken after this game and hopefully when I get to Origins I can share higher praise.

How fun does it sound to only control one person at a time? I'll tell ya it's not fun at all it quite literally made me bored to tears over how boring it was.

Well lets fast forward to the release of Death Stranding, Hideo Kojima's first venture into something outside of Metal Gear Solid and you're probably wondering if it would be anything like his previous ventures. And if you were expecting stealthy action than you're going to be surely disappointed. Full disclaimer I actually love Death Stranding and for an original idea from Kojima it's solid. But for someone who doesn't know what the game is about to put it bluntly you're delivering packages while fighting spooky spirits in a post-apocalyptic United States. The entire idea behind delivering these packages is actually grander in scale since you are essentially reconnecting the country through a form of neighborly love and trust and it's definitely a heart-warming scenario if you think about it. I would honestly call this game a celebration of community and love simply because even though you won't be running into other players you do have other people helping you along your journey whether that would be by leaving dead-drops for you or by helping you build an expansive highway to make traversal easier it really just feels like a ""all hands on deck"" game where you and your neighbors are patting one another on the back and just for that I can easily recommend this.",42.3 hrs on record,N/A
76561198045196300,8,N/A,Recommended,"I often don't review a game based on it's technical issues UNLESS it's a glaring issue and honestly I can not bring myself to continue playing this game. From what I had experienced it seems like an interesting entry but the constant stuttering I'm facing is just too much for me. I understand this game was originally on the PS Vita, a system that was very limited in what it can do for its games this game still feels like a mobile game developed for the PS Vita. Don't get me wrong I applaud the effort that went into making this game HD because it's literally a night and day difference. I know this might sound weird but from an aesthetic design the animus loading screen in this game is probably one of the most gorgeous vacant spaces I've seen in the series mainly because its not a horribly blinding white space. But aside from the eye candy and visual flair this game just feels like its been handicapped because of it's original home turf on the vita and if anything this game deserves a proper fleshed out remake because from what I did play I LOVE Aveline and her chameleon like skills of blending in. Just to get my praise out Aveline was series first that being the first female Assassin you got to play as. Granted female assassin's aren't an unknown thing in the lore but to have you play as a black female during the height of the slave trade really shows how a lot of assassins were motivated by hardships and how they used their situations to their advantage. In Aveline's case she can switch between three different personas to tackle specific situations whether it would be the more stealthy yet limited ""lady"" persona to lure men with her feminine charm, the ""slave"" persona which allows her to infiltrate plantations as a worker, or her regular assassin garb which is a blend of pirate and colonial garb since this game is set between AC3 and 4. I just love how they gave her intuitive ways to handle situations in varying degrees of stealth even though she is just as skilled as any other male assassin. She just uses her charm and hardship to her advantage and that alone is note worthy. I would say try it if you want but for me its just too limited in a way for me to really get into.",1.9 hrs on record,N/A
76561198045196300,8,N/A,Recommended,"When I was approaching this review I had faced a lot of difficulty in regards to finding the right words for Assassin's Creed 3. To be blunt. Back in 2012 I had a severe bias towards this entry mainly because I had just came hot off the heels of the Ezio trilogy, a trilogy that provided probably one of the most beloved characters in the series as well as set the standard for what we as fans wanted from the series. Now in 2021 I will say after replaying the game my original view has tempered even though I still hold some strong criticism for this games protagonist Ratonhnhak√©:ton or just Connor for all intensive purposes. And just to get that criticism out of the way I will say this. Yes I do feel like Connor from time to time is a rather boring character but in all honesty it makes sense due to upbringing and if anything he is more similar to Altair where he is far more noble or stoic and not the charismatic type like Ezio Auditore. His naivet√© is something that I admire from a writing standpoint since it highlights the atrocities of colonial America and how someone that's native may have tried to rely on people like that. Of course I'll just leave the rest of the story up to the player because honestly Ubisoft set out to make a very mature Assassin's Creed game and this one is definitely a lot darker to a certain degree and I truly love that aspect. Now, on the meat and potatoes. Assassin's Creed 3 is the fourth entry in the series taking place in colonial America and from a writing standpoint I admire this decision since that entire era was a powder keg of revolution and bloodshed. Instead of being in the fancy boots of Ezio you now take on the role of a new Assassin by the name of Ratonhnhak√©:ton or just Connor for simplicity sake. Throughout the game you assist many political figures with the intention of saving your tribe and over throwing another Templar scheme which should be par for the course at this point in the series. However for the first time in the series you are no longer limited to the urban town settings of the previous installments, you are now able to freely explore and hunt in the woods of colonial America and honestly I'm not surprised that they added hunting to this game since originally this came out a month before Far Cry 3, another game developed by Ubisoft that reinvented its series with added hunting and exploration. Outside of feeling like a mohawk predator jumping from tree to tree, AC3 adds its own version of the villa from AC2 which is none other than the amazing homesteading feature. There is nothing more satisfying then slowly watching your plot of land develop over the course of the game since your near virgin cut of land slowly becomes a thriving community that opens numerous opportunities for making money, It also adds a lot of character shading for Connor which honestly I never noticed back in 2012. Also one of the other big features of this game that comes from the homestead is the incredible naval missions. The thought of commanding your own vessel of war on the high seas was a spectacle back in 2012 and since Assassin's Creed 4 has come out it may feel rather antiquated in comparison but either way it's still a blast to play through the short list of missions. To top off this review I MUST give a disclaimer to potential buyers. This is the only way to play Assassin's Creed 3 now in 2021 and since it's a ""remaster"" there may be the typical Ubisoft charm of strange graphical anomalies but to me that's the least of my worries. My biggest worries is that you NEED Assassin's Creed Odyssey installed in order to get the activation code for this game to work. I don't know why that's such a big issue with this game but when you buy this make sure you buy Odyssey alongside it and if that turns you off then this may not be the game for you. But if you are looking to marathon this series you'll probably end up buying it anyway. But please keep this in mind when you purchase the game.",25.5 hrs on record,N/A

Yes I feel like everyone can agree that the zombie fatigue is real and very much alive but eventually you get a game that actually makes zombies somewhat fun. Days Gone is a prime example of how to make zombies cool mainly because they are treated more or less like an obstacle or set dressing. Yes you will kill a lot of zombies in this game but beneath the infected corpses of the recently departed rests an amazing story that is gracefully carried by an excellent cast and game world and honestly Bend Studio deserves a lot of praise for this especially with the lead character Deacon.

76561198045196300,8,N/A,Recommended,"I was saddened by the abrupt halt in development for F13 due to legal reasons since Illfonic has show a strong love for 80s horror and when I heard that they would be at the helm of this game I was both intrigued but skeptical. Asymmetrical games have slowly become a mild hot commodity amongst video games and depending on the love and care the studio takes to improve the game it may either die off or live on. Thankfully I picked this game up at the right time thanks to a surge in players via Playstation crossplay and I'll be honest. I love but also kinda hate this game. As a fan of the Predator film series I was very pleased by Illfonic's excellent love and care of the source material going as far as including familiar faces from the films including humans and predators. But gameplay wise I feel like whenever you play as a human you're surely outmatched but then again I am terrible at playing as the predator so I really comes down to the mastery of that role. Playing as the human pretty much plays out like your typical modern fps which isn't a bad thing since I feel like the first person perspective heightens anxiety since you can't have a 360 degree view of your surroundings allowing you to easily get taken down by the predator. In a sort of fan service you can cover up with mud which makes it harder for the predator to detect you but dealing with that and human enemies does become a little much. I feel like if it played out like the first film where the human enemies are dispatched and THEN you deal with the looming threat of the predator it would better enhance match pacing instead of getting hit left, right, and center by numerous obstacles. And don't get me wrong it is a very fun experience when your team decides to work together but if you are dealt a terrible hand of players it can make the experience a little hard to swallow.

Also they got Michael Biehn to voice the lead character, Kyle Reese or Corporal Hicks depending on your love of Sci-Fi and I swear they couldn't have made a better choice.

I guess coming from the nihilistic ending of Far Cry 5 which led into this I was already a little pissed off since the previous antagonist not only survives but takes a mentor role this time around and not just that but the two new big bads Mickey and Lou are absolutely insufferable. I understand that you want to motivate your players with a villain you want to kill but why are these two the least likeable turds I have ever had the displeasure of facing. And no this isn't coming from the fact that they are women, Far Cry 4 and 5 had great secondary antagonists that were women but the thing is they were well written characters with either tragic pasts or they were blindly following a leader due to power. These two are just selfish ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• that just annoy me. I will sing some praise for the world design even though it's just a condensed Hope County but the addition of vibrant pinks and blues is really eye catching and marvelous. Funny enough it really reminds me of something Die Antward would have created hell even the highwaymen remind of Die Antward. But outside of that the game just doesn't do anything for me. It's quite literally Far Cry with RPG elements and now as a way to try and add a sense of scaling or progression you level up and unlike higher level weapons with pre-selected mods on them which for some reason makes me irrationally angry for some reason I guess because I can no longer customize my weapons to fit my play style even though these kinds of weapons have existed since FC3 but making it the whole arsenal just feel cheap. Also for a game that is a direct sequel to the previous game it REALLY feels like an expensive DLC and the fact that they added micro-transactions to help progress in the story also kind of annoys me even though its not the first time Ubisoft did something like this.

76561198045196300,9,N/A,Recommended,"Y'know when I first played Revelations back in 2011 I really didn't like it all too much and even when you look at the release dates for this and Brotherhood it kinda makes sense since they were only released 9 months apart (I'm going off of Steam here). But for all we know both games were probably being worked on in unison to help make them feel some what cohesive and to be fair now as an adult I feel like Ezio's final chapter is generally pretty good especially with what they added. For starters I will state what I didn't like back then which was it felt WAY too similar to Brotherhood so much so that it felt painfully repetitive and even though I still kinda felt that way while playing it again almost 10 years later I feel like I can let it slide especially since this time around you're no longer in either Italy or Rome but instead Constantinople which of course now is known as Istanbul. And with this setting comes one of my favorite additions which is the expansion given to Altair via memories you relive. Outside of the original game and small section in AC2 we never really saw much more of Altair outside of a PSP exclusive called Bloodlines but in Revelations Altair is almost center stage and we see what became of the legendary mentor which to me is absolutely incredible and well written stuff and I commend the writing department for handling it with such grace. One other thing is that Ezio is no longer a young man, he is ripe 50 year old assassin and his appearance is almost similar to that of a wild hound and the combat reflects that perfectly with the introduction of a new hidden blade which is easily one of the most brutal weapons I have ever seen in a game and it feels weird not seeing it return in later games. Also making a return from Brotherhood is the feature of reclaiming the map in this case different sections of Constantinople and with this comes a new feature of defending your territory with a sort of tower defense mini game which this time around I enjoyed more than I did back in 2011. Overall I feel like Ezio's third chapter is possible one of the best examples of giving a character a proper send off and by playing all three of his games back to back you can definitely feel a sense of sentimentality that honestly is kind of missing in a lot of the other games because we grew with Ezio we didn't get a one and done entry with him we got an entire arc that was finished off with the short film Embers (which I also recommend). Definitely play this for Ezio not Desmond. Also like Brotherhood there's some technical issue due to optimization so be aware of that when you do jump into this.",21.8 hrs on record,N/A
76561198045196300,9,N/A,Recommended,I remember my excitement for Assassin's Creed Brotherhood very vividly since it was a direct continuation of Ezio's story which at the time was great since AC2 left off on an incredible cliffhanger at least from Ezio's perspective. When I replayed it recently i definitely enjoyed it more than I remember especially since you return to the briefly visited Rome. This time around however Ezio's status as a master assassin finally comes centerfold since as the subtitle implies you lead the brotherhood and train new assassins that will help you in reclaiming Rome. And it's genuinely a fun system especially when it comes to inducting them as a master assassin. Reclaiming Rome is also another fun thing since it feels like a heavily expanded Villa from the previous game with its own little caveats that make things interesting. This game also has a nice little jaw dropper of an ending one little warning with this game is for a game from 2011 you will have technical issues due to optimization so do be aware of that when you do jump in.

76561198045196300,9,N/A,Recommended,"Assassin's Creed Rogue is a very strange entry that was released at a rather peculiar time since it was released on the exact same day as the then highly anticipated Assassin's Creed Unity and all I can say is that's a good way to kill a game immediately since not only was it released on the same day as Unity but it was the last entry on the seventh generation of consoles. So not only was it competing against a new game but also a game on the then next generation of consoles while it was on the previous generation. But with that out of the way I can say that this game is sort of the series black sheep in a lot of ways or at least one of many since for the first time in the series you are playing as a former assassin that has turned to Templars due various internal issues which I will say is pretty cool. It shows that the assassin's aren't exactly the clear cut heroes that they have always been and even though it makes things maybe a little convoluted I still think it's great getting this double perspective that lends a lot of credibility to what I would consider the ""Revolution"" saga since this is placed in between Haytham and Connors stories in AC3, pretty much serving as an expository entry that details the fall of the Colonial Assassin's leading into Connor's story as well as Arno's in Unity. And in all honesty at first I didn't like the idea of playing as a Templar but the more I played the more I began to understand the protagonists stance in the story. Shay Cormac may be the villain, but in the beginning he's not a heartless monster, he WANTS to do good for people and this is reflected beautifully by this games economy system. In previous entries we had villas, towns, homesteads, and of course piracy on our side but this time its a mix of the Ezio trilogies economy and the piracy of AC4 meaning you can renovate buildings for civilians via acts of naval combat all within an act of good will from Shay. I know it might seem pointless to mention the economy but when you're playing for the ""villains"" this time around you would think of something far more malicious but surprisingly its not. Ever since AC3 Ubisoft wanted to tell a more mature stories and I think Rogue is the crowning achievement with that promise because this entry establishes that not everyone is the good guy and that there's two sides to every story and this story was definitely the most gut wrenching in my opinion due to the fact you see a lot of familiar faces and get a lot of references to the beloved AC4.

Not saying Assassin's Creed 3 was a horrible game but in past tense (circa 2012) I felt burned by the series since I didn't know where the series would go after AC3s seemingly nihilistic cliffhanger. Flash forward to 2013. Assassin's Creed 4 is announced and it has...pirates? At the time I scoffed at the idea thinking it would fail horribly especially since at this point Ubisoft had reached Activision's level of yearly releases. However once I got a hold of Assassin's Creed 4 I immediately regretted those early skepticism's because in my honest to god opinion Assassin's Creed 4 is probably one of the BEST in the series. And why was that? The most direct answer would be ""freedom"". Gone are the simple urban settings of past games. Gone are the boring treks via loading screen. And most importantly gone is Desmond Miles a character that I felt convoluted the story even though yes Assassin's Creed still has moments where you leave an animus you aren't a named character but I don't like discussing these subplots because I feel like everyone can agree that they are the most pointless moments of the game. What does Assassin's Creed 4 do that outshines previous installments? The bigger question should be what doesn't it do? Remember the naval missions in Assassin's Creed 3? Well now they are a key focus of the game, they are literally a pivotal feature since you're a pirate this time around and the very action of scuttling ships or boarding them in a near seamless manner is always a delight. And just like AC3 you can upgrade your ship but this time it's far more extensive and by the end of your journey you will have a bonafide war horse of a naval vessel that any pirate captain would be proud of. Also like previous entries you have a villa/homestead in the form of your pirate cove which is essentially a pirate villa that you will slowly upgrade over time into a small colony of rag tag pirates and shops to further advance yourself. Also since you'll be doing a lot of sailing you will be visiting a lot of beautiful islands where you will plunder treasure and collect the requisite Ubisoft busy work that entails special armor for the player. But you know what it's more than just these detail that make this game a timeless classic for me. The idea of exploring the open water with a crew of pirates that sing sea shanties just warms my heart and there was never a time where I didn't do side activities. Assassin contracts not only net you money but an impressive reward at the end. Naval missions do return and they are also really engaging. Taking down forts are also really fun and a spectacle in their own right and honestly I forget that I'm playing an Assassin's Creed game sometimes because most of the time I just feel like seven seas war lord that's robbing the rich for fun and honestly I think veterans of this series can agree on that point because this isn't just a good Assassin's Creed game, it's a great pirate game that gives you a taste of incredible progression as well as a great power fantasy.

And since you meet this guy in the main game you actually have a voiced protagonist again however it really doesn't matter in the thick of things. Combat is still the same as in the base game but now you are sporting era appropriate weaponry and instead of brandishing a baseball bat you instead have a piece of bamboo, and I guess Jackie Chan is right since you can easily brain someone with the damn thing. Also this game has perma death for your squad since this is a flashback and in the sense of the story it makes sense but there's times where I was genuinely frustrated by this. By no means is this a difficult expansion but your teammates will die INCREDIBLY easy if you're not careful. One example being I shot a bee hive near one and they instantly died.

It almost feels at times like it was inspired by a fistful of dollars since you play for both sides with a singular goal of making money and hunting down a notorious arms dealer. Granted for the time FC2 did some impressive things regrading fire simulation and also grossing players out with the trademark healing animations but I do have some gripes in regards to the combat. It often feels stiff and rigid lacking impact for shot fired and again to hark back to it trying to feel ""immersive"" your weapons do degrade overtime and will eventually begin to jam on you but more importantly explode in a comical yet horrifying manner that would leave any normal person with filled britches. It's certainly a manic joy ride of fire and hot brass but compared to the follow ups I feel like the game is painfully dated but I still have a soft spot for it. If you can get past the slow intro that would make Half-Lifes tram sequence seem bearable I feel like you can really enjoy this game for what it set out to do.",2.1 hrs on record,N/A

Coming out only two years after FC3 it really felt like Far Cry 3.5 and yes I know a lot of people made that comparison and I will say it is a VERY unfair thing to say because even though I personally found the game feeling a little too ""samey"" and not really pushing the boundaries it still won me over with it minor changes to the already break neck formula delivered in the previous game. FC4 is far larger and more vertical than FC3 thanks to the mountainous expanses added in this time around and to help with this they added a gyro-copter to help with traversal. In regards to combat, veterans of FC3 will feel right at home with the slightly expanded arsenal which now includes sawn-off shotguns, antique weapons, and a damn elephant gun of all things. Also to help flesh the combat out even further new takedowns were added to help with vehicular combat since now you can fire your gun while driving which was a much needed thing since combat is far more hectic than the previous game. Also as I mentioned in my Far Cry 3 review I really didn't care much for the protagonist and this time around Ajay Ghale is a man of few words. Far more stoic as Jason and I like that. But do expect to be retreading a lot of familiar beats such as taking over radio towers, taking over outposts, and hunting for upgrades.

I remember fondly how I hyper fixated on this game day and night mainly because of the obvious changes during its development, the marketing gimmicks, and most importantly the memorable villain of Vaas. Now that I have replayed it I feel like I should state the obvious reasons as to why this game is often regarded as the best in the series. For starters the overall gameplay is spectacular. If you were coming from FC2 to FC3 like me this was a big leap from a technical perspective. Gone was the stiff and almost stilted gunplay of FC2 and quickly ushered in was the slick, brutal, and very punchy combat that became a hallmark of this entry. To accommodate this new gameplay came with what I think to be the most unique skill tree system in a game. I love a game that features physical alterations to the character to help sell the growing power and ability of the lead as seen in Fable and most recently The Ascent. Your character has a tattoo that is consistently evolving and with every new piece of ink marking a milestone in your progression. It also acts as tally system for one of the collectibles in this game which is also impressive. Now to state my obvious criticism. The story. Listen I know you play as a bonafide bad@$$ but does anyone really love Jason Brody? I often found him to be an annoying prick half the time and the same could be said for his friends. I don't believe anyone ever speaks highly on the story but instead speak on the incredibly fun gameplay on offer and of course Vaas who played wonderfully by Michael Mando. If you can ignore the inconsistencies and plot holes with the story I feel like you can genuinely experience one of the most viscerally fun games in the series. Also.

Yes it is a open world crime game involving gangs and hostile takeovers but you know what I feel like SR2 does a lot of thing better than GTA. Unlike the later games in this series SR2 has a grounded sense of humor that doesn't rely on the exaggeration. It has a lot of heavy hitting moments that remind you that this game is serious on occasion. Now it is no secret that the PC port for this game is flawed. It is incredibly broken leading to the game almost feeling handicapped. However if you can find the right mods to make this game work you have a bonafide classic that still kicks a lot of ass well over a decade later. You owe it to yourself to try it out and if you can find a copy of the first game for the Xbox 360 you should give that a try as well since that also has a lot of great ideas that were ahead of its time. This is what Saints Row is all about. I understand that a series needs to evolve in order to entertain a new demographic but you should never lose sight of what made the original games so memorable. Hopefully IdolNinja's passing won't be in vain and we do get the promised patch. Even if I must wait a little longer I will out of respect for IdolNinja.

I remember the massive gate keeping that veteran players had towards new comers with this installment saying things like ""you wouldn't understand it"" or ""it wasn't made for you"" however over the past couple of years the quality of this game never impressed me. This is a Quake multiplayer game that was released during the hero-shooter craze thanks to games like Overwatch and Paladins and it shows. Yes, play as familiar characters from the series but they all have their own patented ""ultimate"" abilities that were made popular by Overwatch but even then they don't feel that significant. They just feel like a requirement they added at that time to drum up interest for casual players that liked Overwatch. Also for a series that focuses on break neck speed and skill this game feels painfully slow in comparison to the original Quake multiplayer (I have not played Live or 3).

I remember being a little brat back in '08 thinking this game was just another horror game that would leave very little impact. Keep in mind I was roughly eight or nine years old and my ignorance when beyond just doubting the game, but I also had very little knowledge of it. And by age ten, I played it and was shocked at how great it was. Where games like Silent Hill 2 and Resident Evil 4 reinvented the wheel with games either being art or more action orientated, Dead Space went for psychological horror that was drenched in blood and gore, and I can still remember being on the edge of my seat worrying about what inhuman horror lurked around every corner and inside every vent. Anxiety, atmosphere, and most importantly, tension was so thick you could cut it with a plasma cutter. With the remake coming out in a few days I look forward to seeing how motive re-adapted the Ishimura and it's crew of mutated horrors, because despite the amount of praise I can sing for the original Dead Space it's a little troublesome when it comes to getting it working on modern operating systems.

I remember playing the original Dead Space and being on edge from start to finish thanks to the tight corridors that were permeated with anxiety and unexpected horrors. However Dead Space 2 went in a direction that quite literally ""bigger and better"" since the uncomfortably tight space freighter was swapped out for a sprawling city called, well, The Sprawl. And even though this game didn't scare me nearly as much as it's predecessor it had a whole lot of gusto behind it's combat, writing, and character development for the series lead Isaac Clarke, a character that I find just as important as Kratos, Nathan Drake, Laura Croft, etc. I'm not sure how a lot of people felt when he was given a voice in this game and its subsequent sequel and upcoming remake but it helped flesh out a character that for the most part was a blank canvas for the player. Honestly if you haven't played Dead Space 2 I feel like you missed out on a good action game with some horror elements that may have kept the more squeamish players on their toes, and if you can get the original running on a modern operating systems I strongly recommend playing that as well even though the remake is almost here.

Borderlands 3 is a game that is held up by its impressive gameplay and loot system but is bogged down by a horrible story, annoying characters, and most importantly being almost out of touch with its humor. Borderlands 2 came out in 2012, I was in middle school and back then as an ignorant kid I laughed at its not outdated humor. And now Borderlands 3 comes out almost ten years later with the same cringey humor only to be punctuated by its annoying millennial/gen-z streamer villains that have no redeeming qualities.

76561198045196300,11,N/A,Recommended,"Resident Evil is a series that has had its up's and down's as well as its moments of experimentation, which is typical with most long-running series. Whether its video games, movies, or shows, they will usually mix the formula up a little to keep things feeling fresh. Resident Evil Village at it's most basic is sort of a pseudo Resident Evil 4 in what's no being called by some fans as the ""Winters Saga"" since it follows Ethan Winters and his family. If you're like me, you probably had the literal ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• scared out of you by Resident Evil 7 simply because it was a very raw and unnerving experience that set the stage for the remakes and subsequent sequels primarily with repeated gameplay mechanics, and Resident Evil Village is no different. When I said the game was a pseudo Resident Evil 4 I meant it because the jarring horror of Resident Evil 7 is almost completely removed, and instead replaced with more action than horror, so much so that the devs commented on this shift in tone because too many people were scared by the previous entry which is fair for a wider audience but for the majority it could single-handedly kill interest. For me, the game is ""fine"". I say it bluntly because after finishing the game a whopping four times, especially on the hardest mode, I began to pick up a lot of flaws and shortcomings that first time players won't notice. For starters, this game's structure is very much ""drag and drop"". From start to finish it just feels like you're running a gauntlet or a checklist of locales that needed to fit the more Romanian folklore with Lycans (Werewolves), Vampires, haunted manors, water logged villages with an aquatic monster, and Frankenstein monsters, and even with continuous play-throughs it all just felt jam packed, congested. You go from point to point so quickly that sometimes the action just slows to a crawl for me, granted I know some people love that since it breaks things up and helps to change the experience, but for me, it just goes by so quickly that by the end I was kinda scratching my head. It's certainly not bad, but when you notice it, it does become a little tedious. And by no means am I knocking the design team that made these locations because they are all dripping with creativity that does indeed make things feel unique. Don't get me wrong, the Baker house in Resident Evil 7 is permanently seared into my mind as one of the most haunting places I've seen in recent memory, simply because it's set in a real location with a lot of real world influence and compared to that the mountain town of Resident Evil Village is cool on the surface, but I just felt like I was playing a diet Resident Evil 4 sometimes. Outside the set design, I can say the hallmarks of Resident Evil are here. From managing your inventory, solving puzzles, fighting big bads, and of course exploring the world all feel great! Whether it's upgrading weapons with money or parts you find it always feels satisfying to pop some sorry bastard with a cannon you find or send them flying with a stray shotgun blast to the chest, it could never feel so much better! The best part is that for the first time in a very long time, Mercenaries has made a welcomed return, and it's just as fun as you would expect. So overall, if you want to ignore my tirade about the setting or pacing, I can wholeheartedly recommend Village on the basis that it just feels good to play the first time around, and even when you play through it a second time it still feels good when you've unlocked some powerful weapons to play around with.

But I will say this. If you're looking for a co-op Resident Evil game where you and a buddy can mindlessly murder infected ""people"" then by all means give it a whirl.",4.4 hrs on record,N/A
76561198045196300,12,N/A,Recommended,"Survival horror is a genre that can be described best as ""experimental"". Over the years many studios have come along to add their own little twist on the genre whether it was the cramped cosmic horrors of Dead Space, the Japanese horrors of Fatal Frame, the deep psychological torment of the Silent Hill series, they all owe their existence in part to Alone in the Dark and of course the topic of this review, Resident Evil. Resident Evil for the past 20 something years has had quite the rollercoaster in regard to how they tackled survival horror, whether it was with the eerie Spencer Mansion, the Raccoon City outbreak, or the more action packed adventures taking place in Spain, Resident Evil was not afraid to do something different, so much so that this constant ramping in change sort of killed the franchise for a while thanks to its action-centric Resident Evil 6. However, after laying dormant for 5 years, Capcom went back to basic, and I mean BACK to basics. Resident Evil 7 was the first Resident Evil to scare me in a long time, and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• was it good. Resident Evil 7 takes place somewhere in the backwoods of Louisiana. You take the role of series newcomer Ethan Winters, a man searching for his missing wife, Mia. However, once you arrive at the now notorious Baker residence you can tell that Capcom took a lot of inspiration from films like Evil Dead, Last House on the Left, and The Blair Witch Project and as a Marylander I don't know why that makes me happy. Ethan isn't some special operative or cop, he's a civil engineer, he is the most boring and normal person you can play as and that's not an insult because it's perfect. In previous games, you played as someone with some semblance of military expertise Ethan might be hot ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• at drawing some blueprints but he sure as hell does not know how to use a gun. Playing as a regular guy in a secluded house in the middle of hillbilly land is scary, and it's made even more terrifying thanks to how isolated you feel, you feel like you're trapped in a box that never lets up and thanks to the inclusion of near-invincible stalker enemies it just makes you feel even more trapped because this is THEIR playground, and you're simply a guest for their sick games. Granted you will be armed throughout the game but even early on just shooting these bastards merely tickles them and the RE Engine does a great job at rendering brutal injuries, it makes the gore in this game not just some technical marvel but also uses it to great effect as set dressing. You will see some straight-up gross ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• in this game, you will do some gross ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• in this game, and it is really unsettling for first time players. All in all this a great return to form, and sadly I wish the successor Village could have reached the same level of quality, but it's whatever I guess. But all I can say is if you like feeling uncomfortable, definitely play Resident Evil 7.",12.6 hrs on record,N/A

End of Zoe? Throws that out the window in a good way. Yes it's a short DLC that is a little overpriced for just an hour long story with challenges to complete but it did bring one of most ridiculous characters to ever grace the series. You play as Joe Baker the embodiment of what a true alpha male hillbilly is suppose to be like, He is the kind of guy that will walk the swamps with a banjo playing dueling banjo's just to turn around an brain a monster with said banjo. His play style? He uses nothing but his fists and survival skills to tackle monsters. He is so manly it was once fabled that his beard broke a razor. He is so manly that the calluses on his knuckles are used to sharpen knives. He is so friggin' manly he has a harem comprised of nothing but gators he has successfully beaten in a one on one death match.

Well rebirth is leaps and bounds better and I actually understand the appeal now even if it is still infuriating sometimes but you know what? That's the beauty of it. The Binding of Isaac is a simple rng dungeon crawler that is heavily inspired by the biblical tale of the same name. You play as Isaac, an infant that must explore these underground dungeons while evading his mother and along the way you collect power ups and fight all types of Cronenberg like creatures. Despite its juvenile sense of humor (there's a LOT of poop) there is a lot of dark sub-text regarding suicide, child abuse, biblical affiliation, and abandonment.

Jalopy was a game I played while it was in early access and I can say that it has grown into a game with a basic narrative that serves only as set dressing for the basic gameplay loop. The story that follows is an automotive journey across Europe with your uncle on a mission to spread a deceased loved ones ashes. And in order to carry out this journey you outfit a jalopy with working parts and set out on long drives through the countryside picking up cargo to sell to further upgrade your car. By no means will you find yourself engaging in gun fights with local military or law enforcement just driving and it is by far the most relaxing thing to take part in. Yes it can be frustrating when you pop a tire and you don't have spare or having your engine blow up due to poor maintenance but it is all apart of the journey and almost serves as a right of passage.

In the time I spent in the game there was never a dull moment. One time me and a friend were doing bounties and we were being chased by other players and ghost ships. Our ship was packed with loads of exotic loot so the risks were high and our situation only worsened in a hilarious yet serious manner. While being pursued by players and ghost ships a large Megalodon like shark began to chase us, the weather turned into a thunderous rain storm and eventually the shark and ships left us only for us to be attacked by a Kraken. We fought valiantly and eventually defeat it. After turning in our rewards we decided to outfit ourselves with new weapon skins and clothes and proceeded to do it all again. This is definitely a ""water cooler"" game. A game where you can share these crazy experiences with a coworker.

76561198045196300,13,N/A,Recommended,"Since we are reaching two years since the launch of Cyberpunk 2077 I felt it would be nice to revise my review a third time especially since the new animated series Cyberpunk: Edgerunners has come out on Netflix which yes I highly recommend. But this review for the game, not the show, so to be blunt with the question of ""is Cyberpunk 2077 any good?"" I will say yes. For the most part now in 2022 it's definitely worth a try, hell even when the game launched I thought it had a strong narrative and a great cast of characters that made Night City feel alive even during its turbulent launch, and honestly I can recommend the game for the story alone, however there's more than simply a story to tell especially when you have gameplay that can be a mix of innovative and maybe tiresome for others. Personally, I think the game's gameplay beats of slowly becoming a cybernetic street ninja to be quite entertaining, especially depending on your build. For my two play throughs I either played a jack of all trades, one time and another time strictly a tech-savvy engineer that favors pistols and blades over blunt force, and this is where I draw some criticism especially with the upcoming DLC that's slated for 2023, I feel like the level cap is a little too low. I asked a bunch of people on Reddit for some input on how they feel in regard to the overall level cap, and some people are relatively mixed. Some say it's fair and others (like me) tends to make the game more tedious by the time you max it because you will max both respective XP pools relatively early, making the rest of the sides jobs kinda feel like needless filler on a repeat play through since all the activities are tied to achievements. I know that in a recent patch they added some incentive for completing side jobs in the form of special awards from Fixers, but even then it's usually just a single item. Maybe add other awards in a tiered format for completing X number of jobs can be a good motivator, think of them as ""loyalty"" awards that increase with say every 5 jobs done instead of all of them being completed. But back to the topic of the level cap maybe in the DLC or even in a future patch they can increase the cap a little, I know that in some of the patches they have reworked some of the perks to be more universal adding a more customization to the player's play style but even than I feel like in the sense of a game set in this universe your character being a SOLO (Mercenary) should make them a master of more than two skill trees since that usually what is possible with the amount of provided attribute points. And I get it, this is a video game, not the pen and paper game it's based on, but I like to keep that in mind when I do play the game. For my final closing point, what can I say that may finally reel you in for a potential purchase? I don't know. Overall I feel that in its current state Cyberpunk 2077 definitely feels more like a proper game than it did at launch even if some people still feel like it's lacking to a degree which is fine, personally I feel like it's an ok game, and you should at least give it a proper try before immediately falling back on the early criticism of two years ago, obviously CDPR are not giving up on the title given the announcement of the first DLC and now official mod tools. It's a game they still care about and still want to make better, which they have slightly accomplished in the two-year span, and hopefully they add more stuff that makes this game feel more lively, which from what I've read is on their agenda, and hopefully they follow through with those plans. But Night City as of now is a beautiful display of urban decay, corporate greed, and brutal body modification.

It had lovable characters and great writing while New Colossus lacks this. All the new characters are unlikable and the first half is unnecessarily difficult since spoilers B.J is critically injured from the events of New Order, meaning your health only regenerates to 50 or 70 I guess as a metaphor of him being half the man he used to be? The gun play is spectacular almost better than New Order's since B.J can interchange what weapons he wants to dual wield. However the story is just dreadful sometimes. They try to have very serious moments that are punctuated with jokes and it doesn't help with the new characters being gutter trash. I get that they are characters that survived intense trauma which has shaped them into who they are presently but none the less it just sours the experience a little. Grace is overly antagonistic and assertive towards the original crew, Spesh feels like a cartoon character, Wyatt. My boy Wyatt is a drugged up hippy now, and B.J is a depressed dead man walking that gets [SUPER REDACTED FOR SPOILER PURPOSES] but immediately gun-ho and ready to kill Nazi's again with finesse?

That by no means is an insult because the game does have a good idea but it is slowly matted down by the obvious grinding and implementation of micro-transactions. I never would have expected another Wolfenstein RPG in the form of this game but here it is. On record this game is at least a 4-5 hour long game stretched out by prolonged grinding in the form of lazily slapped together side quests which is is usually a seek and destroy sort of deal or search and recover. Find this protohound and destroy it, find these documents and bring them back, kill this uber-commander. Also difficulty scaling is a big issue that really brought my blood to a boil. I understand that it's an ""RPG"" but to have weak enemies still pose and obvious threat later on despite your various upgrades is a little stupid. And yes I know in the previous games that despite perks enemies could still kill you but later on it feels like the playing field is equal not in this. I still got knocked on my ass despite my heavily upgraded weapons and armor. I understand that there's a weapon mastery trait present with all weapons but again it's just more obviously implemented grinding that's there to stretch out the games run time. Overall if you're a fan of the Wolf series I can say at least try it for the story despite it being almost non-existent. It does set the stage for another game in the series and hopefully when it comes out it rectifies a lot of the Young Bloods and New Colossus's problems such as story pacing and its handling of subject matter.

Empire of Sin is fun but it has glaring issues and suffers from serious repetition. I'll be honest, I was never expecting to play a new game led (sort of) by the legendary John Romero. Y'know. The dude that formed Id Software. The DOOM guys? Anyway playing a game that was spearheaded by him and his wife is definitely cool but god is this game buggy. I've had entire quests break the game. An example of this would be a quest with Jacques regarding a month long absence of breweries. When it was completed my breweries were still closed and were unable to be opened forcing me to either restart or sell them and start from scratch. Some gang member quests are also broken. Whenever a war breaks out good luck having a moments peace. Once a war breaks out it's constant attacks that halt the games flow forcing you to enter fights with the enemy despite ""abandoning"" them. It gets frustrating when you're trying to do something and every couple of seconds you're forced to fight. Combat wise it's fine. The turn based combat lends itself well to the kind of game. It actually reminds me a lot of Omerta. But it does get boring having to go from building to building shooting thugs just to get property but I can understand how this would make sense but I do feel like an automated feature of sending canon fodder gang members to wipe out these buildings would be good. Also. I do wish the game was a little...gorier? I mean come on I curb stomp people and it's just a little splash of blood. Overall I enjoy Empire of Sin. I have 50hrs tracked at the moment I don't intend to stop playing anytime soon.

Well at least not entirely. For starters this is Red Dead Redemption 2 at its finest and I feel like the people that have the luxury of being able to play it at max settings can agree that this game is a visual marvel from the biggest details down to the smallest. Playing as Arthur Morgan feels great and hearing his raspy voice and blunt attitude is always enjoyable. The story is still as gripping as it was a year ago. And exploring is still breathtaking. However with all this glamour it doesn't excuse some technical issues. I do suffer from crashes after about an hour of playtime and sometimes doing a jarring action in game causes a crash like once I was maintaining my revolver and when I aimed it, the damn thing clipped through my horse causing what I can only explain as a damn resonance cascade.

Assassin's Creed at this point has slowly but surely devolved into Call of Duty with almost yearly sequels, prequels, spin-offs, and all sorts of tom foolery seeping from the long running franchise. However I will say that the original and the Ezio storyline are among one of my favorites in the series. Yes the other games have its moments and I will say without shame that Black Flag is still one of the best even though it fell of the beaten path of Desmond's boring midlife crisis (thankfully). But before we had Spartans and Pirates we had a Syrian and a badass Italian Assassin that is worthy of praise. Assassin's Creed 2 is (in my honest to god opinion) the Empire Strikes Back of the series. Going above and beyond to reshape the already established formula of the prior game in a big way. Gone are the days of relying on a singular set of weapons that eventually get upgraded after certain chapters you slowly build up your arsenal and become better. Another big change is the character you play as. No longer are you playing as the master Assassin Altair you now take on the role of a young firecracker named Ezio, whom due to certain circumstances takes up the classic white robes and hidden blade in a quest for revenge. And that's the beauty of this game. You spend so much time with this character seeing him slowly evolve from a spunky young man to the stuff of legends. You can feel Ezio becoming more skilled in the Assassin trade from the way you must upgrade your armor and weapons as well as train him and that's just the tip of the iceberg of great additions. You can dye your robes to break away from the traditional red and white color scheme that is so popular with the Creed, gradually upgrade your hidden blade with weapons that add more value to your already expanded line up of skills. One feature that would later be expanded on in Brotherhood and Revelations you can build up a home base that comes in the form of the Villa de Auditore and even though its nothing too staggering it gives a sense of pride to build up this dilapidated town with guilds and shops which also gives you a source of income. Also the Villa is home to one very special collectible that is worth hunting for. To me AC2 is a worthy sequel that should never be overshadowed especially since it kickstarted a lot of the already prominent features in recent titles and the sequels that followed Ezio's tale also owe it to this game.

When I wrote my curators review it was positive and I really wish their was a neutral review option because the first half of the game was really solid. Granted I never fully came to terms with all the controls and like the idiot I am decided to jump right into hard mode expecting a stylish gun ballet with Hotline Miami in mind. And I was wrong. Granted the hard mode probably makes enemies far more resilient to gun fire in some cases but half the time I felt like I was shooting a brick wall. Kicking gas tanks into a group of 4 people often then not led to only one person getting killed in the explosion. Melee strikes sometimes didn't register. And to top it off the gun splitting mechanic just confuses the hell out of me. I know my review is simply nit picking and I can own up to saying that I just suck at this game and I leaped into hard mode without a second thought but that's not even the worst part. I'm currently at a point in the game where it's mind numbing switch puzzles and platforming and I get that you need to mix things up in order to keep it fresh but all these puzzles kind of soured my experience a little.

Especially since I played Fable 2 first instead of this, but thankfully I have had an opportunity to finally play this and I will say that despite all the smoke Peter Molyneux blew up peoples asses back in 2004. I love the ""original"" Fable. Despite this being a repackage of the original game from 2004 (hence the quotes on original) I genuinely enjoy this. Of course its not Fable 2 which I am more accustomed to but this is a great way to start the series in a generic sense. Yes its a fantasy RPG. Yes its a game about morality. And Yes its a game where you are to do as you please. So far I have bought out houses, raised their financial worth, rented them out, and then slowly became a real estate magnate with the ability to light people on fire. Now when I mentioned that it's an RPG its not in the traditional sense where you level up and get perk points or some nonsense involving complex skill trees. If you have a certain play style you gain XP for that trait. If you use magic a lot you will gain Will XP, if you use melee a lot you gain Strength XP, but if you fight from a distance with bows you get Skill XP and all of these different XP pools are fueled by basic XP orbs you gain from killing enemies for by finishing quests. The best part about leveling up your characters attributes is that it alters their appearance by making them taller, more muscular, more mystical looking, and even older. In a matter of hours of your play time your character will go from looking 21 to 65 since y'know UNLIMITED POWER. The morality system in this game also affects your characters appearance. By being pure evil your skin turns a darkened blue with your eyes glowing blood red with the more obvious change being freaking devil horns sticking out of your skull also your hair is black because y'know PURE EVIL. But by being purely good your characters skins remains normal, your hair becomes a platinum blonde and you have a halo over your head. You can get married, own a house, become an alcoholic fat ass, and...beat your wife with almost zero repercussions besides a divorce order and heaping wad of evil morale. But outside of all of this great stuff I have mentioned I wanted to also use this review as a means to get my voice heard about Fable 2 and the series as a whole. Fable 2 came out in 2008 and its been a good 10 years since its release and if I still had my Xbox 360 I would still clock hundreds of hours on that game. In 2016 Lionhead Studios was shutdown and two key members of that studio went on to make Two Point Studios, the guys that made Two Point Hospital and with Microsoft Studios being the parent company to Lionhead and recent talk of Microsoft bringing more of its games to Steam I would love to see Mircosoft and Two Point come together to create a nice remaster or repackage of the full Fable 2 experience for the fans at least.",23.7 hrs on record																					(12.7 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198045196300,14,N/A,Recommended,I usually try to avoid updating reviews but this needs to be said although the entire community has said it for me. Tripwire has successfully flushed their reputation down the toilet with these stupid updates and creative decisions that have pretty much ruined this game. Adding in weapons that you need to pay for isn't uncommon since they did it in the first game but 10$ for a single weapon is utter heresy and why is that? Because the entire zedconomy they created hasn't made enough money? Nah ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• off with that. However they can make Maneater an EPIC exclusive that they were compensated for which just reeks of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. With all that money they made from EPIC they may want to buy some mouthwash to help get the taste of EPICs ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out of their mouth and maybe reevaluate their position in this industry.,228.8 hrs on record																					(170.3 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198045196300,15,N/A,Recommended,I kinda wish there was an option for a neutral review because although I do enjoy Mordhau for its gory depiction of medieval combat and sword play I will say that the game can some times feel cheap with its already challenging combat. Of course at the time of writing this I only have about 3 hours in game so by no means am I a master of the games combat but I find jarring when I can get 4 kills in rapid succession while only sustaining light damage to only get hit once and die. Granted I do get in the head but even with my trusty axe I hit someone in the head and to them its more like a slap on the ass. Also the friendly fire is very annoying.,7.2 hrs on record																					(3.2 hrs at review time),N/A

76561198045196300,15,N/A,Recommended,"You know. It's a damn shame that I have to leave a negative review for a zombie themed DLC for what was a decent base game. This DLC and the others shows why you should never and I mean NEVER trust a season pass. Going into this I was expecting a fun zombie fueled shooting fest, but instead I got this garbage. This DLC is about as brain dead as the zombies themselves. How so? Let me run down the reasons why this sucked so bad. For starters. I like the entire meta movie pitch idea but for the love of everything holy why and I mean WHY does the ""story mode"" (If you can even call it that) have to be narrated by one of the and I mean THE most obnoxious people in the Far Cry universe. Guy Marvel literally embodies this frat boy loser that sweats up these stupid movie ideas and uses the F-Bomb like its going out of style. Granted I don't mind foul language but Jesus Christ this guy screams it at least 50 times through out the 7 levels to the point where I just wanted him to shut the hell up. Oh another thing. The levels... I understand that its a DLC but Hours of Darkness and Lost on Mars gave the player a large map to explore albeit it was small compared to Hope County but what does Dead Living Zombies give me? Closed off areas or small maps that literally point in the direction to go. These maps are way too small and I always felt like I was led on a leash from start to finish, I mean seriously at least the other two DLCs let me explore a little. When ever you do finish the levels you unlock a score attack mode for that level you just finished so you go back and rack up points to earn rewards for the base game, at least you have an incentive to go back and play the levels, right? But all in all this was one of the most drab experiences I have ever played and coming from Ubisoft this is just unacceptable now you could cut it some slack since its a DLC but why should you!? Imagine buying the season pass on day one (Like I did sadly) only for this to be a part of the deal. It's truly embarrassing and unacceptable.",0.0 hrs on record,N/A
76561198045196300,15,N/A,Recommended,"Survival Horror Reborn When I heard that Resident Evil 2 was getting a remake of sorts I could genuinely say I was excited. Resident Evil 7 brought back everything that made Resident Evil, well, Resident Evil. Skrimping by on supplies and managing your inventory was definately what made the game so challenging in its hay day. And now here we are with the remake and what can I say that everyone hasn't said already? Nothing. So lets get into the nitty gritty. A Beautifully Grim Apocolypse Like Resident Evil 7, Resident Evil 2 takes advantage of the RE Engine, a powerhouse that delivers a truly gourgeous retelling of enviroments and set pieces from the original, and it doesn't stop just there. Character models, Props, Weapons, and Monsters are all modeled with incredible detail from blood sticking to your clothes through to how you can individually tear chunks of flesh from zombies. The more open outside segments do deliver with great lighting effects and reflections from rain and street lights and textures on the police station are crisp and highly detailed. A Hero and Heroine Rises Like the original you can take on the roles of Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield, two survivors caught in the middle of a zombie outbreak. Both characters have a unique personality and of course a unique playthrough that varies greatly between their weapons and key characters they meet from Sherry Birkin and Ada Wong. They aren't silent either, both characters will exclaim their current prediciment and even display pained emotions when injured. A Looming Threat As in the original you will encounter familiar enemies and key monsters and one in particular will literally keep you on your toes. The Tyrant T-00 (Mr. X) returns but this time around he's a little different. The Tyrant is a continuous threat that looms over you throughout certain parts of the game and conventional means prove to be useless against him so your best course of action is to simply run since shooting him with even your more powerful weapons prove to just put him out of commission momentarily only for him to come back in full force. My Criticism's and Addressing Others If you're expecting to come into this game with the mind set that it will be easy you're surely wrong. Yes. This game is difficult even on the Standard difficulty setting which to me isn't much of an issue. But I do find mild irritation with some things. Yes this is a survival game and yes you're expected to manage your resources since spending ammo to kill certain enemies is pointless and more often then not you can just run past enemies without wasting a single bullet. But sometimes you're going to have to pop a shot off on some enemies and in the original zombies weren't all that difficult to take down especially with a shotgun. Sometimes in the original you could just stand still aim high with a shotgun and blow a zombies head clean off without any fuss. In the remake however the zombies are far more resiliant to even basic gunfire and unlike how in the original a few shots from your pistol could take down the most weakest of opponents in this game zombies can soak up rounds better than Hannibal Buress. Why does 6 critical shots to the head simply stun the zombie? Why does a point range shotgun blast to the face do diddly-squat? I understand that the devs wanted the player to simply immobilize zombies so you can more easily traverse the station but even that feels pointless. A new feature to the game which I do find useful is the addition of barricades but even when a window has been barricaded you will always return to that area with a handful of zombies still wandering about. With how much I enjoy the return of The Tyrant he becomes more of a nuisnace then a threat. Yes. I still shake in my chair when I hear his thunderous footsteps but after that I get a mix of fear and frustration since trying to ourtun him only leads you into more danger forcing you to rush certain tasks which again I understand for the sake of keeping suspense at an all time high. Some people have complained about the difficulty. And to that I say play assisted mode then. It pretty much holds your hand and raises your chances of survival. And if its still too hard? Then go back to Fortnite and Minecraft. My Vinal Verdict Even with the antiquated controls and mild nuisances Resident Evil 2 is effectively reborn. It has plenty of new twists for seasoned players and is very friendly to new comers and with that in mind it casts a bright light showing that 2019 is off to a great start and that survival horror is still very much alive.

But does that take away from the fun of this game? Not at all.

Coming soon is another update that will be implementing Nightclubs, which is another way to make easy money as a player. However it's going to be incredibly expensive. This is not Grand Theft Auto anymore, this is a pay-to-win sh*t show that makes having fun a chore and more of a barter with your wallet. Seriously, starter packs? Thats not GTA. I never condone microtransactions unless they're done right and Rockstar has russled my feathers since they have removed money from my account because some punk @$$ modder dropped 20k on me resulting in continuous amounts of money to be removed from my in game account and making that money back in a legit manner is next to impossible even with all of my many ways of making money since players love to destroy my progress. Maybe if Rockstar got their heads out of their asses and added these money making methods to private servers maybe my tune would change but no, they won't do it. Also the amount of hackes is still incredibly high and all of these OP means of killing one another is really getting tiresome. And I know what you're thinking and yes I use to love play GTAO but at this point it's getting stale and it's just...not fun. And it breaks my heart seeing the game go down this path and the ironic part is how Rockstar promotes game modes that are giving double cash and RP but guess what. No one plays them. Because why should they? Especially when you can just buy money making the entire point of stealing and being a crook pretty much pointless.

This game hasn't even been out for 24hrs and it already has amassed mostly negative reviews which are definately earned. Even with all the references I see sprinkled here and there (Certain cars and weapons) this game is terrible mainly because it's another generic Battle Royale game that no one asked for. There's a founders pack thats shoehorned in the main menu and cosmetics are heavily overpriced but not only thats despicable. In-game cash is carried over from previous games and that leads to players being able to pay for weapons in the beginning of every match. Lag is highly present and the game is poorly optimized. Some structures aren't even textured, there just generic polygons that resemble a house/building. The worst part is love this games ""aesthetic"" and I feel like it would be a good singleplayer open world adventure game with co-op but no I guess Battle Royale is the future of gaming.

I like dungeon crawlers but I always hate the term of ""Rogue-like"". I feel like randomly generated level layouts kill any sense of creativity and originality. But WASTED is an exception for me since it is a vastly unique and often at times frustrating due to some often odd or out of place design choices. For starters the game takes place in the year 1980 after a nuclear apocolyspe scorches the earth into a cell-shaded bleached paradise of booze riddled delight. WASTED focuses heavily on alcohol and the adverse effects of a radiated liquor called non other than ""Booze"" (Since it's infused with radiated ooze for that extra leukemia taste). Booze is a sought after substance that almost every ""Waster"" wants and you being a said ""Waster"" fall in this crowd of hangover indused mayhem. But enough liquor talk. The game seems to borrow heavy influence from the recent iterations of the Fallout franchise. In the beginning of the game you create a character, give them a name, and start trucking along in these ""Coolers"" to get the aforementioned Booze and a collection of loot which involves weapons, healing items, and clothing. During your crawl through the coolers you can find unmarked flasks and the legendary booze and both items give you either negative or postive boosts to help you achieve the ultimate buzz. Unmarked flasks give you a random buff that will stay with you until you go home and often or not you will get something really good or really bad. With booze you get permanent buffs that stay with your character but just like the flasks they give you good or bad effects and when you drink these you get a massive hangover and return home. The upside about the booze is that you know whats in them upon finding them. One thing you should know is to not get attached to your character because perma-death is in play meaning when you die. You die. That character is gone for good. But you do get a replacement but they don't carry on the acquired effects of the consumed booze which could be a good or bad thing since your now deceased character probably had alot of bad effects from the consumed booze and this new character may give you a second chance. If their is one thing that really boils my whiskey is a looming threat that hunts you while you're in the cooler. Upon entering a cooler or a new area you have a time limit before this hunter comes for you. Nontheless however I do feel like this game is very entertaining despite it's minor short comings.

On paper the premise sounds like something out of the mind of Quinton Tarantino. But alas the game falls a little flat in a lot of areas but still comes to be slightly enjoyable for maybe 3 hours.

CONS: - Repetitive Gameplay - Weapon progession feels really grindy - Game looks very outdated and lacks creativity in some areas - Crashes at the most inconveinant times - Stealth is a joke Overall the game is very run of the mills and at times it is good fun but it just feels very hollow and repetitive since some levels are recycled at points.

76561198045196300,17,N/A,Recommended,"Back in 2011 nothing felt better than hearing of this game. All it took was one day after school and a trusty issue of Game Informer landing in my mailbox for me to get hyped up. Sadly, if I could talk to my younger self, I would probably backhand him since this game is nothing but a disappointment. It's not bad nor is it good, but it is a Saints game, just not the one I was expecting. Now you may ask. Why did I buy this game if I already have a preconceived notion and opinion on this game? Because this is the internet, dammit. Anyway, what's wrong with the game. Well to be honest the game isn't broken but mostly has so many odd design choices that make it differ heavily from the second game. For starters, the customization. Granted, the character creation is quite an improvement and actually leaps and bounds better than previous iterations, but what is very depressing is the clothing selection. In #2 (I'm going to be doing a lot of comparisons in this review) you could layer different articles of clothing that helped you as the player mold a certain unique and personalized style ranging from T-shirts to over shirts to even jackets, at the time it was unique and still is. In The Third, you are very limited and only provided with preset tops and bottoms, making for a more linear sense of fashion. But look on the bright side, you can change the colors at least. Weapons are another thing that are both good and bad. In #2 you had a whole plethora of firearms and melee weapons that would probably make The Punisher even smile, but as for The Third you have only a small handful of weapons that can be upgraded into truly devastating works of art. Skills are a new addition that give the game a small sense of being an RPG. Skills range from reduced damage, weapon skills like faster reloading and being able to hold more ammo for every class of weapon, you also have gang skills and special skills that help in earning more respect (the game's XP) and money. Now you might be wondering ""Hey this all sounds great, and you're leaving the review as positive, so what makes it bad?"" Have you ever heard of too much of a good thing? Well, that idiom applies here. When you fully upgrade all the reduced damage and reload speeds and even the weapons, you pretty much turn into either a god or a Hollywood action hero. You will take no more damage, you will no longer have to worry about reloading or ammo for that matter, and eventually all your weapons destroy everything in a glorious blaze of glory! So how is this bad? Well what's the challenge at this point you pretty much are unstoppable, actually scratch that YOU ARE UNSTOPPABLE. You just shrug off bullets like a minor bee sting and just keep trucking along like Luke Cage with guns. In #2 you earned perks that made the game a little easier but still kept some challenge in the way and not making the game borderline mediocre and repetitive. Remember in the beginning of this review where I stated I had heard of this game from a Game Informer in 2011? Well as luck would have in that issue there were screenshots of items that never made it into the final game and I also read somewhere on the internet that Volition cut 70% of the original content from this game. Imagine what this game would have been if that content wasn't cut from the game. It probably would have been the perfect follow-up to Saints Row 2. But I digress. The game isn't terrible nor is it bad, it's just such a sharp turn from what made the second game so great and memorable. Nonetheless, the game is fun and I recommend you but the ""Full Package"" version of the game since it comes with almost all the DLCs (Only 2 aren't included, which are the unlockable pack and bloodsucker pack). I still recommend the game, but if you're a die hard fan of the series, you might be a little disappointed with the odd choices that Volition made. Maybe someday we will get a remaster or rebuilt version of this game along with #2 and maybe even a port of the first game. As for now, enjoy the game, it is a blast to play, I can guarantee that much.",10.6 hrs on record																					(10.2 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198045196300,17,N/A,Recommended,"I feel rather mixed with this game although I do find it quite enjoyable for the most part. For starters let me point out a few key things that I personally feel should be changed. The price for this game is way, and I mean WAY to high especially with the amount of content provided out of the gate. 3 maps, a handful of well made Jason's and decent gameplay are not and I repeat are NOT worth 40$. This game should be atleast worth 20 or even 15 dollars at the most. Another thing that worries me are these consistant bans that are going on (thankfully I've been unscathed) in the community due to a number of players that are undoubtedly toxic. If I get banned under false pretenses I demand a full refund. One last thing before writing the pro's and con's I did have an intance where I ran into a cheating counsler that could teleport and hit me through doors delivering an instant stun whilst I was playing Jason. Anyways onto the pro's and con's PRO: - Great sound design - Farely nice graphics with plenty of options - Grand amount of fan service - Enjoyable gameplay - Varying play styles CON: - Gameplay can get repetitive - Bizarre controls (feels kind of floaty to me) - Chad, just Chad F*** that guy JUST PLAIN WEIRD: - OH GOD THE FACES PLEASE FIX THE FACES I'M DYING OF LAUGHTER Personal Thoughts: As an avid fan of 80s B-Horror and slasher films it feels great to have a game commemorating quite possibly one of the most terrifying icons in slasher horror. Jason Voorhees is a power house and you feel it when you play as any of the current variations. You really do get a sense of power that is truly and nearly unmatched compared to the counselors. Although many people may argue saying that Jason is way too overpowered obviously have never seen a single Friday film. On the other hand when it comes to playing the counselor I feel like its more enjoyable then playing as Jason since there is a real sense of atmosphere and terror. Although you aren't left completely defenseless any practical means of killing Jason are quite literally thrown out the window since all you can do is stun Jason. However there is a way to kill Jason but its really elaborate and complex so good luck getting it done unless you are playing with friends. Gameplay is very enjoyable especially with the idea of perks for counselors. This helps with surviving Jason's onslaught but with Jason every variant has its own up's and down's which can throw a little bit of a learning curve towards a player. But after awhile the gameplay becomes a little stale since it slowly becomes been there done that and really you start to notice how its so much the same thing over and over again. Now of course the ban wave is rising issue thats resulted in perma bans without any real context as to why and I can see how this can turn some people away from playing the game. What should be added: Of course why just stick to multiplayer and Jason? Why not add single player and Pamela Voorhees or even other variants of Jason (Jason X or FVSJ). Add maps based around other locales like a ship, space station, or maybe even New York. All in all the game is fine but it can of course get repetitive and the bans have me on edge so until the devs sort this stuff out my review will remain negative for now.",17.5 hrs on record																					(11.3 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198045196300,17,N/A,Recommended,After playing for about an hour I can say it has a lot of great potential. The atmosphere and enviroment truly give a sense of fear of the unexpected. What awaits you in this game is something truly psychological and a true test of your will as a player. PROs: - Incredible sound design - Well done enviroment - Great graphics - Incredible atmoshpere CONs: - Can get boring - KOS (It's a survival game so it's what to expect) Personal Thoughts: In my first hour of the game I was welcomed into a very convincing world that shows decay from events that have unfolded. The atmosphere really got my heart pumping since there is this sense of stillness due to the silence and it can really generate some anxiety if you let it set in. There's always a sense of despair while you walk through these abandoned towns and see them inhabited by overgrowth and what remains of less fortunate survivors. I did eventually find some weapons and new threads to accompany me throughout my tread in the world and ran into another survivor whom was armed with a pickaxe and my first response was to tell him not to do anything then fatally shot him in the head leaving him in the woods. Whilst walking through the woods I witnessed some wildlife and my first glimpse of an infected enemy which was some sort of dog but it ran away and didn't engage me. Walking along I found deserted camping grounds and found an unloaded rifle as well as the makings for a camp. I walked along and ran into a slightly more agressive player that ran towards me. I yelled warnings and fired my remaining rounds from my handgun missing once and landing two non-fatal hits. The player began hitting me with their bare hands and landed a few hits but I inevitably won the fight with a hatchet with a swift hit to the side of their head. I then jumped off a bridge into a lake below in order to get to a boat that sadly wasn't functional. I walked down a small road I came upon two players fist fighting. I drew my rifle I yelled a warning for them to stop. They did stop fighting and one player fled the scene as I took aim with my unloaded rifle and made one of the unarmed player get down on his knees and put his hands behind his head. I then proceeded to brain him with my hatchet and pursue the other player. He got the drop on me but when I drew my rifle and he backed off and I procceeded to brain him with my hatchet. So far this game reall has a grim twist on sense of realism that taps into psycological fears. The game reminds me of the film IT COMES AT NIGHT where it feels like man really is the true monster although in the game there are physical monsters. I can't wait to see where this game goes in the future since it does feel very well done even in it's current state. Buyers however should be aware that this game is a SURVIVAL game so KOS is going to be a feature that you will run into since people can be literal savages and show very little remorse towards you. I'd recommend playing with friends in order to increase your chances of having an enjoyable experience since playing alone can get boring and probably give you a negative perception of the game since players can and probably will outright murder you without any remorse. I see a bright future for this very dark and very twisted game. And can't wait to continue being both a survivalist and a monster.,1.3 hrs on record,N/A

76561198045196300,17,N/A,Recommended,"For a game that is on sale I do feel quite jipped on the title. Before I purchased the game I read reviews before hand such as it being some like a cross between Max Payne and Devil May Cry which are both fluent and yet often challenging games. This game seriously feels like a game I would buy off the app store. The ""fluent"" controls litterally feel like your character is wind dancing as well as looking like a dopey ballerina. When the game decides to ""switch gears"" and decides to become a third person shooter it feels like a clunckier Gears of War. Of course this is suppose to mix things up but both styles are incredibly unpolished and really you can just shoot your way through sword fights. Their is no english language which I don't have a problem with but it may make the story a little hard to follow for others. Also the visuals are horrid with little detail.

76561198045196300,18,N/A,Recommended,"Story Time Many years ago when I first encountered the PS2 classic Red Dead Revolver I knew I was in love when I first played the game thanks to the western motive and styling as well as the enjoyable gameplay it brought as well. Now when was 4-5 years old I remember seeing commercials for Gun and always begged my dad to get it for me. Of course he never let and always gave me the speel of ""Oh its violent"" like any other kid my age at the time. Now 11 years later I now own the game and let me tell ya after those long awaited years my expectations have been none the more met. The Positives: For an old game running on a modern opperating system Gun runs flawlessly and despite how dated the game may appear it does pay a lot of attention to detail mainly in character models and atmoshpere. The controls are a little weird at first in my opinion and they could have been better but again this game is 11 years old so I will cut it some slack in that regard. You are also given plenty of variety in side activities that reward you with cash and stat points which give the game some light RPG elements and its almost recommended to do these side jobs when you can in order to progress at a smoother pace with enemies that pose a real threat. The Neutral: Despite the given variety in missions is does get a little repetative but not to much to where it will jade any sort of enjoyment for the player. The Negatives: Now if your all into graphics this game will dissapoint you since it is dated and it dosent support modern resolutions like 1920 by 1080 and the graphic options are also quite bleek with detail. Overall its a fun game with some smart writing and characters but overall just being enjoyable",10.6 hrs on record																					(7.6 hrs at review time),N/A
76561198045196300,18,N/A,Recommended,"With a game like this I have alot of good and bad to say. For starters I want to say whats good. Blue Estate is of course a fast paced rail shooter based off of Victor Kalvachevs graphic novel of the same name which feature charcters such as Tony Luciano, Cherry Popz, and Clarence. This game feels more like a promotion done right because every moment I played it was truly intoxicating with the humor and gun play. Now I do wish it wasnt a rail shooter but its overall incredible fun. Although I haven't read any of the books this game is making me want to buy a few only to engross myself into the universe of Blue Estate. Now comes the bad which is this game is very short (3 hours to be exact) and dosen't really offer nothing more than arcade mode and a difficulty mode. Also Clarence is almost very uninspired and boring lacking what made me love Tony Luciano. The charcters portrayal of a stereotypical ugly american italian mafioso is just icing on his comedic preformance from his racial slurs down to his shoot first ask questions later attitude. I can and obviously will recommend this game to anyone looking for a good laugh in the beggining but to be sure to fall asleep in the middle as Clarence.",3.7 hrs on record																					(3.0 hrs at review time),N/A

APB: Reloaded is a cops and robbers shoot em' up featuring loads of customization from tattoos, cars, guns, music, and of course your character. Now on paper it sounds like a solid idea and I will say it is but I have a few gripes. Like any other lesser know F2P title this game relies on micro-transactions (not forced thankfully) that are a little stupid. You want to own a gun permanently well throw some G1C down (in game currency) and your all set. Besides that matchmaking is more barren than a woman in her 70s I will sometimes by luck find a district full of 7 people or a measly 2 which is not exciting at all.

We got some pretty good guns too, lots of them have secondary fire and even more mods that you can unlock as upgrades, some pretty decent gore (that you can disable if you're not into it), you have the option to play the game in a more arcade-like experience or go in a more realistic experience, with your guns jamming on you once they're worn out and having to be mindful of real bullet drop.

Aiming down sights sometimes makes the whole gun model to go up, blocking your aiming. This happens randomly 3. Melee is wonky to say the least, it's difficult to measure the distance between you and your enemy when you're trying to land a hit, but that could be skill issue. And yet, the core of this game seems pretty solid; loved the idea of a coop game where people have to gather themselves together so they can proceed to finish the map objectives, so even though the release was pretty rough, I feel like this game can get into good shape with some elbow grease.",0.8 hrs on record,N/A

Visually this game also stands out a lot, because using pre rendered backgrounds in the 2020s is not something you normally see, but it is present in Alaloth and yep, it looks gorgeous. The battles? You could consider this a Soulslike but with isometric view, since you'll be blocking, parrying and dodging while you wait for your opponent to drop their guard so you can get a few hits in, but you won't be seeing enemies with crazy patterns like you see in an actual Souls game.",12.9 hrs on record,N/A

We also have some beautiful spritework done for the ""player model"" because believe it when I say that you can view your own feet and legs in here, but the great work is also extended to the enemies and their animations and the weapons... OOOH, THE GUNS! They all sound amazing and look incredible and feel amazing to use, with each one of them having a situation they excel in so you don't be overly dependent on a single one to carry you through the game. Think that's all that we have? Oh but it isn't, because the way levels are designed make it for an incredible easy experience to go through them, find key items and where to progress, everything feels incredibly organic and in no moment I felt lost while playing CULTIC, and I even found a bunch of secrets withoug using a guide, just because all of them were hidden in places where you could simply find them through exploration, not button mashing or attacking random walls.

Puzzles are simple, the difficulty comes from waves of enemies being thrown at you at the same time instead of them having different behaviours that would demand different ways to deal with them but it's not so bad since the game is fairly short. All in all, this is a fun title to pass your time during a weekend, and while it isn't the most polished game over there, it's stable.",4.8 hrs on record,N/A

Bosses are challenging but never cheap. Yes, you will most certainly die in the first 2 or 3 encounters with a boss until you get it's patterns, but there is always a checkpoint right at the entrance of the boss arena, so you'll have to only worry about watching their movements to learn the patterns and fight effectively.

Bonus points for having 3D FMVs. ----------------------------------------------- Editing this review just at least try to show you guys how enjoyable this little gem is. Yes, it is a short game, the amount of hours I have in this game represent me taking my sweet time going back and forth through locations in search of items, new dialog or new enemies to fight. No leveling here and no random encounters either, the battles in here are more similar to what you see in Gothic or Baldur's Gate | Divinity Original Sin, where defeating an enemy in the map will make you not having to face that fella during the rest of your playthrough, so the only way of improving your attack and defense is by buying new weapons and armor with the currency dropped by those enemies (which is limited), making this not a grindfest while providing a decent level of challenge without ever feeling unfair. I actually thought it was quite easy, to be frank. Visually speaking this game is a banger, the color usage, spritework for the locations you visit and for the battle are all incredibly creative and well animated, and man, those 3D FMVs in the style of the game? *chef's kiss*. There is even a bunch of those, more than in older JRPGs.",6.4 hrs on record,N/A

Combat is also something you have in this game and in no short amount, but by the end of the 20ish hours campaign, you might get a little tired of it since enemy variety isn't that great and the situation you encounter those enemies as well when you're not in Story missions and the amount of moves you can execute is quite limited, even with new things to unlock in your skill tree.

The fluid animations, especially in the intimate scenes, add a layer of dynamism that elevates the gaming experience. The ""touchy feely"" moments are meticulously crafted, contributing to the overall visual appeal of the game. Surprisingly, the narrative for Mirai and Misaki unfolds with unexpected depth, offering players more than just explicit content. However, the game's focus on themes like blackmail sex and NTR may be a dealbreaker for some. These elements are integral to the storyline but might alienate players who are uncomfortable with such content. Moreover, the protagonist's character, portrayed as an extremely unlikable jerk, can be a divisive point that affects the overall enjoyment of the game. In essence, Peeping Dorm Manager presents a mixed bag of pleasures and disturbances. The anime-like pixel art, coupled with fluid animations and a commendable narrative for certain characters, provides a unique gaming experience.

One of the funnest games I've played this year, it captures the charm of the games of the PS3 and 360 era perfectly, even though it still leaves some of the undesirable things from that era in form of extreme linearity and lack of freedom, i.e you cannot fall to a lower level without being on the correct spot denoted by shining chains , we at least don't have to deal with the abysmal QTEs that plagued that generation. The game is nice to look at even though it is not a AAA title, the art team knew how to design those wild west environments and give them a nice and unique look with that sanguissuge touch, always making everything look good and fresh. Character models are also fairly good, at least Jesse's one, since the others are not seen that much during the game, not having even moving lips when talking to them outside of pre-rendered cutscenes. The meat of this game is in it's combat, though. Brutal, impactful, meaty and fast. The 2018's God of War is clearly an inspiration, but you can also see an ounce of Devil May Cry with the enemy air-juggling with melee attacks or your revolver while adding some Doom Eternal touches with the myriad of guns you can use in combat and the cooldown you gotta manage WHILE prioritizing targets according to the level of threat. No, don't worry. The more threatening enemies are not introduced prematurely, but in a slowly and methodic manner for you to get used to the combat and new perks that you will get along the way.

Yes, we do have the classic tank control scheme, but you can also use the 3D movement, similar to how RE: Remake HD Remaster and RE 0 HD Remaster handled this topic, which might or might not appeal to everyone, followed by the classic camera angles seen in the old Resident Evil titles, and that I know it will piss some people off, so if you're not interested in the ""classical"" way, you might want to leave this game alone, but feel free to try it, you can still refund your purchase if needed. Combatwise is a bit of what you expect, you hold a button to auto-aim to your closest enemy and then hit another one to shoot, with the addition of a dodge that you can use at any time in combat, very reminiscent of the one that Harry Mason uses to dodge enemy attacks while meleeing his foes to death, and the same approach in this game is reasonable due to that. Music, well, despite being made by only 2 people, those guys proved that you can make some fine and atmospheric tunes for a horror game, with appropriate music for tranquil spaces, save rooms, fights with enemies and to alert you that the chaser enemy is present in the room (yep, we got one of that, just like ol' Nemmy and RE2 R Mr. X), and we can segue into the sound design, with weapons sounding incredibly punchy considering that they're all makeshift, and the sounds of the environment being creepy and well placed and the ones made by the enemies while they're moving is damn right scary. Oh, yeah, I forgot, we also have puzzles, like, a lot of them, which will probably make you use a walkthrough to get through them if you have an average IQ like I do.

Let me address ya that this game is good, it is the closest thing to Megaten Devil Summone that we will get and it manages to continue the story of Persona 5 in a great way, with good writing that had me laughing a good while, specially when Zenkichi got into scene (love that gramps, such a nice guy), but I believe this isn't enough to hold your attention enough when the enemy encounters have no variety, which in itself isn't a bad thing as this is a Musou title, but when you stretch your story to the 40ish hours long territory (according to HLTB data), this becomes a big chore, and for me that is a big letdown, just like it was with those 100+ hours of story that we had on Persona 5, in both cases bringing me the same relief when you finish a boring chore when you finish a dungeon inside the game, meaning that the only challenge present in here challenges your patience, not problem solving skills. And not only that, but this game manages to stutter quite a lot during a few times, a thing that doesn't happen with games that SHOULD happen according to the gaming media, such as FF VII Remake...

That is not the only thing that this game has in common with the MMORPGs of yore, as it is VERY grindy, I mean, 2 hours in and I couldn't even craft a new simple sword or armor due to lack of resources, and battling in this game while it is not hard in any way, it is fairly lackluster. It has good animations but the feel of the combat is... wrong, like it was made to be played on a mobile device and not on a KB+M or Controller.

Now on the other front, you see other modern gaming tropes that detract from the traditional Max Payne experience, like the abundance of cutscenes in-game, specially those ones that interrupt the shootouts, all of that on a game with a 10 hour-ish campaign and I dare to say that those cutscenes compose about half of the campaign, and the other half, the aforementioned shootouts are not ""free flowing"" as in the older games, instead, hiding behind a cover is a feature that you will mostly use, leaving almost no room to turn on that good ol' bullet time and jump while shooting dem baddies.

Yes, I'm talking about the time-bound events. It was enjoyable to time your arrival to certain locations to make the story progress since in the beginning you have a good amount of things to do and places to explore, as everything is new at the moment, and even if the controls are clunky (you have to thank the Dreamcast controller only having one analog for a full 3D game), there was fun to be had, but by a few hours in you already know the layout of the places that you explore and nothing new comes to greet you, yet there is still need to wait for in-game time to be able to trigger a cutscene to you can advance the story, leaving you with two options: 1. stand in front of the place you need to be and wait some IRL minutes (between 5 to 10) so you can trigger the cutscene, or 2. go to an empty place and practice your moves so their effectiveness (and by that i mean damage dealt) doesn't decrease over time Both are extremely boring and in my case decreased my interest by the game after playing it through the weekend and it bothers me that the second one is more of the same as the first one. Bear that aforementioned point in mind when deciding to get this game or not, because if you are easily annoyed, this is going to be a rather frustrating experience to you.

This is not just a game, it is a frickin' masterpiece, my dudes, hands down one of the best survival horror games OF ALL ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• TIMES, worth getting it at FULL PRICE, but even more during a sale, cuz' there is a lot of bang for your buck right here, pal. 1 - Visuals Let's address the cute and lovely elephant in the room first, Alien: Isolation is GORGEOUS! This thing was released in October of 2014, almost 6 years ago, and albeit some nitpicking regarding the anti-aliasing, everything that you see during your playthrough is AMAZING. The lighting effects are amazing, making it possible to see little grains of dust floating in the air in a room with a working fan, the light flickering in the end of a dark hallway and the quality of detail to the general environment gives this game some solid visuals, and I'll tell ya that this will be atemporal, cuz my man... Also, the visual part gives me the perfect bridge to talk about the... 2 - Immersion With how realistic and beautiful those visuals are, attaining the title of ""immersive game"" is not a hard job for Alien Isolation, I mean, boot up the game and look around you, the whole environment ain't just eye candy due to it's high quality looks, but they form a cohesive ""visual experience"" regarding the Aliens universe, the Sevastopol space station, upon your first steps into it, is definetly run down due to some stuff going on. Doors aren't working, the lighting are failing, doors are on lock down, machinery ain't working, the floor and walls are all scratched, smashed or blown up somehow and a lot of day-to-day stuff is scattered through the ground, a result of survivors salvaging everything for supplies while they wait for help that may never come. You see a lot of tech stuff, proprietary to the Aliens universe, and sadly I cannot babble about this as this is my first contact with the franchise after Prometheus , but reast assured that everything in here looks just as it should to make you feel immersed. Oh, immersion also results from... 3 - Sound Yeah, you'll prolly piss your pants while playing this game, specially if you're using your headphones, cuz you see, the SFX in here are amazing. Gunfire, explosions, movement, the Alien moving through air ducts and stomping the ground, all whilst it looks for you are godlike. You have your trusty motion detector to alert you if something is approaching, but guess what? The thingy may betray you since it's relatively loud and your enemies (humanoid and xenomorphinc alike) can hear you, so what to do? Pay attention to your surroundings, the soundworks in here ain't that amazing just for show, they're here for you to use them. Listem to humanoid chatter or Alien movement on ducts to decide where you should go, if you should go ahead or retreat. 4 - real SURVIVAL horror Collect scraps, compounds, alcohol and other stuff to make medkits, smoke bombs, noisemakers and explosives, use them to take your enemies head on, distract them or use it as a trap to stop'em from following you, in Sevastopol you really need to SURVIVE! Search every nook and cranny for supplies or salvageable parts, my man, and also, ammo, sweet and scarce ammo so you can get out of a ""I effed up"" situationp (or to wreak havoc, it's your decision, pal). Also, don't forget to sneak your way past dem enemies, my dood, or you may regret it. Also, just look at my playtime, this beauty may offer you roughly TWENTY HOURS OF CONTENT , much more bang for your buck than RE3R (I'm still salty about that game), with visuals that can take the Capcom's game head-on.

76561198020340815,18,N/A,Recommended,"It's always hard to rate a Tales of game with only POSITIVE or NEGATIVE, since even for fans of the franchise, there will be certain elements that will be utterly obnoxious, not only for the players regarding the franchise itself, but from a game design perspective as well, but well get there eventually and you'll be able to consider that specific point something positive or not. Well then, shall we? 1 - Plot: This game kinda tricks you into thinking this will be another Tales of with a slightly silly plot, where one Hero, living his/her peaceful life in a small village will have bestowed upon himself/herself the responsibility for saving the world of the imminent danger that the Devil Lord is, and with a heart full of passion and wonderful comrades that share the same vision, you begin your journey, but this is only the first two hours of the game. Yes, the protagonist is living a happy life with her younger brother and brother-in-law after a great calamity, but since this game goes on heavy about tragedies, another one happens and then we'll be presented the true nature of the plot: Vengeance. It's tone is in complete dissonance with everything that I've seen coming from the franchise and I LOVED IT. 2 - Characters: Characters are important in every game that aspires to have at least a meaningful story, at least in RPGs, and Berseria definetly delivers some good stuff in this department. Aside from the occasional cringy moments involving some anger outbursts from the protagonist, all of your party members are certainly full of life and with some deep personalities, also, all of them join your party for a specific goal that they have in their minds, ranging from paying a debt to finding someone important to them. Oh, of course you'll get some character development for everyone, and that ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• will get really heavy and emotional as it can get. 3 - Gameplay: This might be a bit divisory, since I've seem a couple of individuals not enjoying how the fighting strayed off from what the Tales of games used to conduct it's battles. First of all, we still have some sort of limit on how many attacks you can use sequentially so the game would not turn into a hack'n slash for the mid 2000's and it still posesses it's traditional combo system, but the speed in which the battles occur had a major overhaul since the cooldown for attacks has been slightly lowered (at least I think so) and you do not use Artes in the old fashion, by combining the attack button with a specific direction, now every face button on your controller will be assigned to an Arte AND each time the button is pressed, a new Arte will be used to the limit of 4, making the game incline to even more action than it's predecessors. In my opinion this was a neat change and a good way to keep things fresh while still maintaining the traditional feeling of the Tales of Games, but it might throw you off. 4 - World traverssing: Now I gotta tell ya, this is definetly one of the major flaws of the game. First of all, the amount of backtracking would make even the horror titles from the PSX era jealous, because oh boy, you do go to the same area an awful lot of times. Second, even though the maps at the start of the game are rather short and quick to traverse, while hitting the 15ish hour mark of game time, those maps open up A LOT, and combine it with a slow walking speed and BAM, we got the formula for boredom. Third, you have some items that help you in teleporting from point A to point B, which help to cut the time spent in crossing terrain, but those are hardly usable in story sections since the game will make you walk back from where you came to view a cutscene, and thus, more walking at a slow speed to get somewhere. Definetly  a big thumbs down in here. 5 - Grinding: I know, if you're into JRPGs, you'll grind for levels and farm for items in a certain level to progress through the game in a consistent and steady manner, without surges on difficulty that may turn you down, but this is a point on Berseria that could be considered an exception to the rule. Constant grinding for levels, Gald and Grade makes you roam those big ass maps with a painfully slow walking speed for quite a few hours, otherwise, no good equips neither skills for you, my boy. I tried to cope with that, but I gave that up and just rushed through the game so I would not be bored to death by the half of the game. By playing Tales of Berseria, you'll be greeted by an amazing story with some neat characters and a great battle system, but bear in mind that progressing through the game there is a high chance of you dropping it due to the movement speed and broad maps. The game is good, yeah, but it has this one big flaw, making it a ""partial recomendation"", so buy it at your own risk.",48.0 hrs on record,N/A
76561198020340815,18,N/A,Recommended,"Capcom set the bar too high with the previous releases for the franchise, those being Resident Evil VII and Resident Evil 2 Remake, who brought back those beloved real horror elements and puzzles, forcing you to use your brains to proceed through the game, not only shoot your way through. Oh man, those 2 releases were amazing, I could really feel the classic elements and the modernity converging into one coherent experience, so my hopes were really high for the Resident Evil 3 Remake, my favorite in the series. I was let down Now don't take me wrong here, I'm not saying that this game is totally bad, it is good, really good. It uses our beloved RE Engine, it holds stunning visuals, sounds, enemy designs and animations, the soundtrack is awesome and it even features some neat throwbacks to the classic versions of RE 2 and RE 3, it also prooves that this new engine is amazing for a more action oriented Resident Evil Game, but lemme stop praising the game here, since I am a big time fan of the franchise and let me go to the complaining part. 1: Length and replay value Length. Yeah, yeah, I know the classic one is a rather short game and you can finish it in the same time my steam counter says, albeit it might take a little bit more time due to the increased difficulty presented by the mechanics and the puzzles, but it still would be a short experience as well. Pay attention, I said WOULD BE. By getting to the end of the RE3 R, you unlock a neat little shop where you can buy upgrades with coins awarded to you by your performance on the game and use it in your next playthrough, that's cool, right? Yeah, except you have no real incentive to go on as you'll simply have to replay the same sections all over again, with no change at all, just shooting your way through things. But by beating the classic RE3, you feel rather uneasy, since the choices you made during the Live Selection moments led you to ending A, and now you're rather curious about ending B, so you gotta figure out the differences, man! You even unlock new weapons, get infinite ammo and such, it's really cool! Finished both endings? Well, you still have the Mercenaries mode if you're up to the challenge, you won't be let down by the content presented in the game, pal. 2: This game thinks that you're dumb I mean, I'm not the most shiny apple in the field, the sharpest tool in the shed nor the most smart being in the universe, but I'm not THAT dumb, so WHY IN THE HELL ARE THE PUZZLES GONE IN HERE? During the total lenght of the game, only one ""challenging"" puzzle was presented in the game, and I say it with ""QUOTATIONS"" because I had to place little to no effort to besting it and continuing the game. And what have they done to replace those puzzles? They've put Resident Evil 6 all over it, just shooty shooty bang bang. 3: This town is smaler than I thought... Yeah, you guys probably seen a lot of people complaining about the complete cut of some memorable parts in the original game, like the Gas Station, the Raccoon Park, the Graveyard AND THE CLOCKTOWER... Oh god. Yeah, Raccoon City Mayor CAPCOM decided to overhaul the city to make the zombie apocalypse not that chaotic, I guess. There are a lot of other points to complain in here, like Nemesis being more of a pushover than a real threat, the excessive scripted segments with BOOM KABOOOOOOOOM scenes like a Michael Bay movie and the linearity, but that would be too big of a rant and I'm not here to be a ranty oldman, at least not for so much time, so my veredict is THIS GAME IS MEDIOCRE AF, BOI Buy it at your own risk, but you have many better games to play besides this thing here, pal.",5.9 hrs on record,N/A

A coupe of students from the Ural Polytechnical Institute decided to go hiking on the north of Ural Mountain only do disappear from the map and then later be found dead in unfamiliar circunstamces spoooooooooooky and this is the base story for this, being complemented that you are an investigator for a certain organization tasked with finding the truth about those deaths. And after the initial cutscene, you're thrown into a small village, and from there, you have to find your way to your objective COMPLETELY ALONE AND WITHOUT ANY HINTS IN YOUR HUD. Yes, this is that kind of game, and that's awesome, it forces you to pay attention to whatever the hell you are doing, and after that you ""receive"" a map, a compass and a flashlight, and be on your merry way to complete your quest! Your map contains some notations on it's left side, with coordinates suggesting points that might be of interest to your investagion, so go investigate them! Make your way to those points, mate! Use your compass and map to guide you, watch for landmarks and traps and collect notes to help you achieve your objetive! The game gets boring, 'tho. Anomalies chase you here and there, giving you not much time to read the map and pinpoint your location so you can make a route for the next POI and bang, you're wandering the map and stumbling your way around until you find a new note. The game does have a good ambiance, the visuals are amazing and the SFX does send some chills down your spine, at least until the first hour or so, then, the sounds just get on your nerves and your only wish is to hit alt+f4 and uninstall the game, like me (or maybe not, I don't know you lol).

Mix powder with some stuff to make bullets, or health drinks, stamina drinks or the ones that keep your body temperature high enough so you don't die of hypothermia, pay attention to your surroundings to solve the puzzles and make progress and maybe to get a little help from a lovely old friend for horror games that is hidden behind a door to make some BOOM SHK-SHK and make the enemies go WHOOOOOA, all of it without using too much time from your life to play the game, with some level replaiability granted by them achievements (that I know you like, you dirty completionist) and honestly giving you a good time, ya'know, the good time that only short 'n sweet games can give ya.

76561198020340815,20,N/A,Recommended,"So, I just beat the game and my final veredict on it would be BUY IT Why should you? well, because: 1. The game is visually appealing : at least if you're into anime, manga and stuff like that. Hell, if you weren't you wouldn't be even considering buying this game, thus, not being on this page, but I digress. Stylish characters, stylish weapons, stylish skills and combos and stylish armor designs makes this treat to your eyes. 2. It is fun in multiplayer : One of the most crucial points that made me buy this game is the MP, sadly it doesn't have PVP, but the coop is quite good, specially because you can ""summon"" someone anywhere without the need of a ""sign"" on the ground, making it quick to have somebody to watch your back agains't those nasty terrors, yikes! 3. The soundtrack is full of jams AND neat sound effects : From orchestrated music to some light pop-eletronic-something music and the good ol' rock'n roll, this game has it all, so not only you will be very pleased by how the game looks, but also by how it sounds. The sound of the hammer pounding the ground or your sword slashing through a horror is something that will not be leaving my mind so shortly. 4. They really put INTELLIGENCE in that AI thing : Your NPC partners in this game are quiite smart. Yakumo pointed some really cool items for my, as well enemy placements that I wasn't aware of, and that really helped keeping me alive, when I switched to long reange weaponry to fight a distant enemy, Yakumo quickly assumed a defensive stance and positioned himself in front of me so he could take the shots in my stead. I believe I fell in love with him 5. Lego, but with skills Yo man, you can really create some cool builds in this game, not in the same way as Soulsborne titles, by allocating points to certain stats so you could raise determined parameter, all of your level ups in here are the same as traditional JRPGs, you get all of your stats sorted out automatically. Yeah, I know, I loved the autonomy too, but don't worry, because in here you can collect a lot, no, really, A LOT of ""Blood Codes"", which are ""part of the memories of other characters"" carried by their blood that can make you inherit their skills, and there are more than a 150. Yes, 150 skills. But every game has it's flaws, and Code Vein is a part of this. Why? Well, because: 1. I swear I've seen that enemy somewhere before : Yep, you did, the same horrors you face in the beginning will be fighting you at the end, sometimes with a change in the color pallete, while most of the time it'll be the same copy and paste. 2. Why am I the only one growing up here? : You fight Terrors, you earn ""Haze"", the ""currency and exp"" in this game and then you level up. Noice, but why I cannot do that to my partners? 3. Fire the architecht that designed all of this : You like mazes? me neither, specially because my memory sucks and I always get lost at it, even if I just beat it. Well, the level design here is kinda lackluster in a way, since all it does is put mazes in front of you. Not a game breaker, just a minor issue. 4. Naw man, get outta there, I can totally see you! : If you've played any Soulsborne games, you may already be familiarized with the enemy placement of the franchise, and nothing changes here. Sad. Yeah, I know, the game has quite it's share of flaws, but hey, it is fun, I've enjoyed it and I even plan on getting all of the achievements in here, since I wanna see all of those endings, cuz doods, the story is quite yummy.",44.4 hrs on record,N/A

Pros : Visually speaking, the game is gorgeous, and considering that the devs put that kind of work into a FREE GAME makes it almost an obligation to play. No, seriously, download this and play it, the sceneries are well built, the light sources are wonderful, adding a lot to the eerie atmosphere of those claustrophobic hallways and making you walk slowly just to be sure you're not gonna get rekt by some unseen enemy; The soundtracks are competently composed and used with the right timing, making adrenaline rush through or filling you with uneasiness, truly well done I tell ya The maps are quite small, but they have the same treatment as the maps in the Soul series has, with little surprises hidden throughout not so obvious places that will help you A LOT, like medkits and batteries; The enemies, at least the non-human ones, are genuinely creepy, with nasty sounds and a moving speed that scared the eff out of me Cons : Them enemies, dude, they do not think before acting, and while that is perfectly acceptable to a non-human enemy, to a human one that should not be happening. All the human evildoers that I found just stood still in front of me waiting to get shot while shooting at me like a Storm Trooper; In this early access version you only have access to 2 weapons, an Assault Rifle and a Pistol that, if my ears do not deceive me, have the same firing sound, so... yeah; Aiming down on sights is a great way to hit your enemies while using guns, but since the enemies here move in quite a speedy way, it makes it hard to hit them (at least for me, since I have the motor skills of a toddler with 1 arm); Sprint button stopped working and the dialog subtitles disappeared from the chapter three onwards, making some things uninteligible to me. While the game has quite a list of flaws, it is worth playing, since it's free, short and only in early access, making me have no doubts that the final product will be high quality.

The thing that caught my eye on it's release time was it's setting, a game which took place amidst a messed up Moscow (and world) due to WW 3 consequences, with no possible way of living on the surface anymore, as radiation was present like microtransaction on Eletronic Arts games -everywhere and all of the buildings were destroyed because war, thus making humans live in the Metro tunnels throughout the world. Yeah, it's a post apocalyptic story, and the gaming world has seen a lot of those, but I believe they were not well conducted as on Metro 2033. Instead of using a open world approach as other games with the same setting do, Metro 2033 focus conducting you on a story driven adventure, providing you with a immersive experience in a different manner, putting you in the shoes of the young Artyom, a 20 years old fella who has the mission of informing the Polis about the threath that has fallen on his home station. Your ride has 7 episodes, making you walk through the Metro stations, abandoned tunnels and the dangerous surface of the dead Moscow, all that with the constant threath of mutants and other individuals who are bonkers for not uniting themselves and trying to recover the world fkn nazis and reds, but not Hanza, them Hanza guys are cool (I think) , but you may even forget that as the visuals on the Redux version are AMAZING.

Oh, and we have some really fun dialogues, sad ones and some great deductive skills by Joshua. -The combat. Oh boy, that combat is really lovey dovey and hard AF, because it has more depth than I thought and I had to use a guide to orient myself in which orbments to use to get the best out of each character in every section of the game. Oh, and you'll have to switch the orbments A LOT if you want to improve your survivability in this world. -The music is something that I really have mixed feelings about, since the game doesn't have a lot of OSTs.

Cons: -As I said, there is a little point in the musics of the game which makes me feel a little ""weird"" (not in the good way). Yep, the music is great and all, but sometimes, the chosen track doesn't fit with the scene in display, like in the city of Zeiss. ------------------------------------------ Yeah, that's the only con I found out in here.

76561198020340815,23,N/A,Recommended,"The scenery and the battle animations are really neat, but the sound effects, the character design and the pure ""shounen style anime"" story (with a lot of clich√©s) is really obnoxious. Just no, sir. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- EDIT: Since most of you guys doesn't know how to differ a personal opinion from a world statement saying that ""this is game is bad and you should not play it"", lemme expatiate in a more technical way about the nature of my review. First of all, I am a person who does not dislike Shounen style manga and anime, but I'm rather picky about the ones that I read and watch, and that is one of the reasons I disliked the game. The setting of the story is interesting, even being a lot clich√©, where the characters get placed in a world which is being threated by evil deities called Gigants (who have a pretty nice design, by the way), and it's up to a group of people to save the world from this menace, and they are called ""Demi Humans"". Ok, everyone has seen this kind of setting before, but even though is repetitive, we can still take on this game, because man, look at those sceneries! And look at those character animations! Damn, it is really hard to witness such wonderful graphical work in 2D JDungeon Crawling games (and no, I'm not being sarcastic here). But hey, what is wrong with the sound effects? Why do they sound like a mix of today sounds with those from cartoonso of the 80's? They seem really outta place in here, dude. And why do they have to go to school when the world is crumbling to the Gigant Menace? I do know that education is an important aspect of life, as it is responsible for social inclusion and cognitive development, but can't we forget this kind of thing at least for a while and SAVE THE EFFING WORLD FFS? Oh, and we have a siscom in here, who is jealous of the protagonist of the first chapter because his ~imouto-desu~ is interested on the main guy. You see, I wanted to like the game, man, but those issues are forbidding me to do so, specially the sound effects.",0.5 hrs on record,N/A

Man, Final Fantasy XIII is truly an amazing game - not like some older games in the series, but it is - and it's easy to see that after you play it. Graphicwise, the game is really neat, with some really good facial expressions and incredible enviroments, like completely ""crystral frozen"" lakes to ""beach-towns"" like Costa del Sol, not forgetting about it's nice share of creepy places. The art style in the game is familiar for every player, as it is the same as the older games, human based player models. The music is prety nice too, being just as catchy as a Shin Megami Tensei soundtrack, so you guys might like that. But the game has some issues with unstable framerate, cycling from 60 FPS to 19-20 FPS if you are an AMD user like me, but the game is still good and you should give it a chance when it enters a Steam deal.

76561198020340815,24,N/A,Recommended,"Eu n√£o tenho como descrever a beleza visual e ""folcl√≥rica"" desse jogo. Voc√™ controla Lara Croft no in√≠cio de sua carreira como uma arque√≥loga em busca de uma terra perdida no leste japon√™s, onde reina a lenda de que uma princesa possu√≠a poderes capazes de controlar o clima, como criar tempestades em um piscar de olhos, tudo isso para ""alavancar"" sua carreira. Devido a complexidade da expedi√ß√£o, Lara convida seus ""amigos"" para auxili√°-la na busca pelos segredos dessa terra, os quais s√£o versados nas artes jornal√≠sticas (Sam, japonesa linda <3), na arqueologia (maldito professor aproveitador e ego√≠sta), na navega√ß√£o mar√≠tima (equipe super fofa de navega√ß√£o :3) e seu mentor na arte de sobreviv√™ncia na selva (Roth √© um grande mito sem mais). Mas chega de conversarmos sobre a teoria do jogo, e vamos para a pr√°tica! Para muitos jogadores, Tomb Raider 2013 pode parecer um ""Uncharted com protaognista feminina"" devido a falta de presen√ßa de Lara no mundo dos jogos at√© o lan√ßamento deste game, mas garanto que o jogo tem muito mais a ofereer que Uncharted, como por exemplo seu sistema de ""n√≠veis"", onde Lara recebe experi√™ncia ao derrotar inimigos ou coletar itens de interesse pelo mapa, assim como colher comida. Semelhante a Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, Lara tem de sobreviver da melhor forma poss√≠vel nas selvas perigodas desta terra desconhecida, ent√£o nada melhor que ca√ßar comida em meio a paisagem nada amistosa do jogo para se manter alimentada, sem esquecer de se armar o suficiente para isso. No que tange os armamentos, Lara disp√µe de um pequeno arsenal, sendo este composto por armas de fogo e um foderoso arco e flecha assassino de lobos, o qual pode ser refor√ßado para tornar-se mais poderoso e tem√≠vel por seus inimigos. Mas nem tudo s√£o flores, pois h√° algo no jogo que me incomoda LEVEMENTE, ou seja, n√£o atrapalha a experi√™ncia  do jogo. Esse ""algo"" s√£o os controles do jogo, os quais podem tornar-se meio confusos no decorrer do jogo pelo fato de n√£o responder em alguns momentos (Essa √© uma grande semelhan√ßa a Uncharted, em.) mas como dito logo acima, n√£o interfere no prazer de jogar este game.

Humans could get to high places and spam M4A1 shots on them, making it impossible for zombies to reach, but in Contagion, this is different. The PVP mode is a mix of FFA with a VS and King of the Hill Mode. You have to kill the other players in order to survive, and be advised, all the players begin as humans. Killed some of them? Nice!
